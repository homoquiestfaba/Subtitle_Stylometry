In the 19th Century,

Jules Verne wrote some of the
greatest adventure stories of the world.

Novels such as 20.000
Feet Under The Sea,

Journey to the center of the earth

...and The mysterious island

Most considered his works
as science fiction

Vernean's known otherwise.

Journey 2

Journey 2
The Mysterious Island

Not good!

Good boy!

Damn thing!

OK, here we go!

Good evening officers!

Anyone up for a late night swim?

Hi buddy.
We missed you at poker this week.

Thanks for the call, John but
what's going on?

We didn't want this going out
over the radio...

...kid broke into a satellite facility...

...then he's drove his dirt-bike into
the McGillecuddy's pool.

I talked them out of pressing charges.

Anderson, your stepfather is here for you.

I know legal guardian.

If it weren't for me you'd be in juvie for
the next six months.

I'd rather do the time.

Do you want to explain to me...

...why you were breaking into a satellite
facility out of the middle nowhere?

Don't worry about it, mom. It's nothing. Really

The police calling in the middle of the night
is nothing?!

Sean!

Hey, Sean! We've got to talk about this.

I'm still confused as to who gave him the
speaking part. - Hey!

Without my speaking part, you
would be visiting you in jail right now.

I'm already in jail.

What's that supposed to mean?

Sean!

Look! I didn't ask be taken away
from my old school and friends

and be dragged all way to Dayton.

It's OK, Liz.
No, it's not.

Sean!
Sean!

I got you. I'm just gonna figure out
what you mean.

I am not here

It's me, busy?

Yes

Hey, I'm just looking to talk to you

You know, uhm... as a very concerned adult to a
somewhat troubled youth

Which one am I in that equation?

Hey, hey, buddy.

What's all this business?
Nothing.

That's a cryptogram, right?
Looks like Morse Code

Taking a look.

Ony-syllable words are dots

...while two-syllable words are dashes.
Learned that in the Navy.

OK, then.
What's it say?

What's it for?
It's complicated.

So, is the code.
It's complicated.

OK. Here's the deal.

A few nights ago a radio signal
got sent out from somewhere...

...could have been anywhere. These words
were playing on a loop.

Hip zorn strucks

These all characters are taken from
the books of Jules Verne.

Clearly the message was sent by
a Vernean.

and my equipment wasn't powerful enough
to receive the whole message.

So...

So you broke into that satellite facility to
boost your signal

Look, someone out there sent this message
and I'm gonna be the person who solved it.

This is really important to me.

Hey, you know what?

Why don't we solve this together?

Fine.
Good.

The first part of the message reads,

The isle... island...

...is...

The island is... real.

Are you serious?

You're not messing with me?
No.

This is what it says.
The island is real.

I can't believe it.

I can't believe somebody actually
found the island.

What island?

The Mysterious Island

Verneans have been looking for
this for years.

What's the rest of the code say?

Child of Steve

Born 1883

Child of Steve. Child of Steve...

May be son of Steve?
Steven son. Stevenson.

Robert Louis Stevenson
The author

Yeah, but he was born way before 1883.
It's gotta be somebody else.

May be it's not somebody.
May be it's something!

What are you looking for?

A book.

Treasure Island. Written by Robert Louis
Stevenson in 1883.

What's the next part of the riddle?

Alright.

The name that's last is
going fast

He hitched his tail to Lemuel's mast.

Wait, so his last name is going fast
What is he, is he a runner?

What if his last name is Fast?

Fleet. Or Quick or Swift?

Swift. Jonathan Swift.

An author?

Writing about Mother Island.

Gulliver's Travels

So, Leumul must be...

...Lemuel Gulliver.

Right, we have three different books.

By three different authors...
About three different islands...

Maybe, maybe all three books are
about the same island.

Maybe that's why nobody has ever found
Mysterious Island...

...because they haven't used the
other two books.

Treasure Island's got a map?
Yes. Swift has one, too.

But these are different than Verne's.
I don't get it.

What are you doing?

You know what I did at the Navy, Sean?

No.

I won the esteemed...

Rocheford Award...

three years in a row...

...for code-breaking.

It's incredible.

I think we found the mysterious island

What are those?

Coordinates. Latitude and longitude.

And that'll put us right about... here.

About a hundred miles off the cost of Palau.
Smack dab in the middle of the South Pacific.

What do you think you're doing?

I gotta go.
You're going to where?

To the mysterious island
A-haha. Alright! Cool!

Hey, can you stop by the moon
bring me ice cream? - I will.

You gotta be kidding?
Listen to it.

You're not going to Palau, Sean.

Why not?

One, you're grounded and on top
of that, you've got school.

I'm a 'Straight A' student, I can afford
to miss a couple days.

Besides, this is Mysterious Island.

Slow down, slow down. OK?

Do you think you can travel
half way around the world and...

...meet the someone lunatic
who's messing around on the ham radio?

He's not someone lunatic.
He's Alexander Anderson. My grand father.

How would you know he sent that?

Look, it makes perfect sense.
He's the original Vernean in the family

He's been looking for Mysterious Island
like half of his life and...

...nobody heard from him in 2 years.

I think he's in trouble and
I'm gonna find him.

Sean, stop! Sean. Stop!

I'm not letting you go on a
rescue mission. Certainly not by yourself.

And whether you like it or not buddy,
you're still a kid.

Look, I understand your situation. OK?
You want to make my mom happy and...

...and I appreciate that. I really do.

But, you need to just focus on running your
construction company and...

...and paying the mortgage and asking
her how her day was.

Because I'm okay.

And like it or not this,
this is bigger than you.

Apparently the message was sent
by his grandfather

Sean said he's been missing for
couple years.

Well, he'd hardly be missing if he were
never around in the first place.

I wouldn't trust one word from
Alexander Anderson.

Sean seems really convinced

It's always convincing for Alexander.

I see. So in Sean's mind Alexander
is this glamourous adventurer.

When in reality...

he was just a man that wasn't
there when his family needed him the most.

That's exactly why we need to let Sean
go on this trip.

Why?
Because, Sean needs a man in his life.

Somebody who's gonna be there
for and connect with him.

And we were cracking that code upstairs.
That was the first time that

...we were on the same page for more
than 5 minutes.

Then bond with him on some none
mysterious island. Like Hawaii.

Hawaii, our honeymoon.
Aloha, Hawaii.

I'm serious, babe.
I'm serious too.

Listen, we fly on to Palau and when
Sean realizes the island is not real

...and his grandfather's not there
I'll be there to cushion the blow.

And done will be done.

Good morning buddy.
It's 0700 hours.

I'm busy.
I don't think you're gonna be too busy...

...for this.

I'm going to Palau?

Close! We're going to Palau.

What?

Look, I know you want this team
road trip to work...

...but I've been on these adventures
before. So, just let me handle this.

Easy, buddy. Just remember who's
financing this whole trip.

Queen Isabella didn't tag along with Colombus.

OK Isabella. I'll let you handle
your thing.

We'll see how... Hey, watch the lizard.
Watch the lizard

Watch the lizard.

Big man's afraid of a little lizard, huh?

Big man's not afraid of anything.
I love lizards.

...when they are boots and belts.

Excuse us?

Hi.

Hey, how is it going?
We're... uhhh... we're Americans.

You... tour guy?
Sean.

I... I got this.

You... you take us on boat.

On water.
You wanna charter the boat?

Official language in Palau
is English.

Thank you. Yes, we need someone
to take us to an island...

...located... right here.

Absolutely not.

W- Wait. Why?

Because there is no island, just bunch of
stories. It's a graveyard for ships.

We'll pay you good money,
a thousand dollars

Only a fool trades his life for money

Excuse me, excuse me.

Today is your lucky day.

I'm Gabato Dagota. Best captain in Palau.

I understand you need some
transportation.

Yeah, that's great. We need someone
to get us here. A thousand bucks if you can.

Uhh, baby. Easy peasy.
Easy peasy. Let's go friends.

Here we go. Let's go!

Ohh, man. It's gonna be so good.

You know, you won't be disappointed.
I've taken a hundred people out to sea and

...brought them back almost
every single time.

Nice!
Nice ride!

Thank you. Thank you.

What the blue heck is that?

It's the finest helicopter in Palau.

I'd hate to see the worst.

That's my security system.

I'd rather take the Titanic.

Kailani. We have customers here.

You must meet my daughter.
She is the real beauty. Looks just like me.

You don't want this chopper.
It's not gonna work. Let's go.

Should we Hank? You know what?

I want to get a better look at this.
This chopper's pretty, freaking gorgeus.

This is the daughter that looks like you?

Look, same nostrils.

Who are these guys?

I am a scientific explorer.
Hi.

And he is... uhh... he is...

Hank.
Hank.

Right. So...

We need to get to these coordinates

Not on this helicopter.
That's the deadliest part of the ocean.

Time out. Sweetness, come here.

Sweetness, look. They agreed to pay
one thousand American dollars. OK?

I could help with college for you then.

Make it two thousands.
No way.

We had a deal
Then make it three thousands.

And good luck in finding someone
else take you there.

<i>Please.</i>

Do you take Visa?

Good afternoon, folks. And welcome
to Gabato Luxury Tours.

Please sit back, relax and get
ready for the ride of a lifetime.

And now a word from our pilot.

This your pilot and...

Here we go.

Gotcha!

If you look out your window on the
left side ladies and gentlemen...

...you'll see what is known as the
Pacific Ocean.

And on the right side, you will see
the other side of the Pacific Ocean.

Are you gonna do that whole trip?

Sir, you did pay for the luxury tour.

Beautiful sky, huh?

I mean, today just seems
especially... majestic.

Majestic?

Really?

I have to finish this off.

You have to go around the storm.

According to these coordinates,
that's where the island is.

There is no island there.

Looks like we're about the find out.

Papa, we gotta get out of here, now!

I'm thinking the same thing.

No, no, no. Wait!

The mysterious island.

Chapter I

Passengers are gonna be taken
into the circling movement of a column of air.

Sean, we're about to fly into
category 5 hurricane.

Now is not the time to take
the book literally.

Look, we have to go into the eye
of the hurricane... - Move, move!

...to get to the island.
Are you psychotic?

We'll never survive.

I'm with you.

You know what? I trust gravity.
Come on, get us out of here, now!

You're right. I agree with you but
here is the deal.

I'm not flying the helicopter anymore.

Controls are all broken.

What?

We're going down!
Oh, my god!

We're going...

Not like this!

Sean... Sean... Sean! Sean!

Come on, buddy. God!

It's okay. It's okay.
Try to sit up.

That's my boy.

I told you it'd work.
You're right.

I can't believe we made it.

It's Jules Verne man.
You gotta believe.

Where are we?

Where is my father?

Somebody help me!

Help me!

My body's been cut in half!

Papa, your foot right there.

My severed foot!

It's moving!

It's moving!

Then, then I'm still in one piece.

You were right. There is an island.

Not much of one.

This is not what I was expecting.

Alright guys, listen up!

We have to gather upeverything
that washed ashore

...and take stock of our supplies.

We have to find shelter.
Let's go.

There you are baby. I thought I lost you.

Baby girl

Hey! I think I found a way off
the beach

What was that?

It's a scary noise in the dark cave.
Keep moving. Keep moving. Go, go.

If this is Heaven,
I'm checking in.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I give you-

The Mysterious Island.

What is this place?!

This island... It shrunk us.

Turned us into giants...

Sean, what does Verne say about this?

One of the first laws of island
bio-geography.

Small animals become large
large animals become small.

Lilliputians. Like the little people
in Gulliver's Travels.

I can keep one as a pet. I could
make him a little trunk-warmer.

Hey, check it out.
You guys see that smoke?

It gotta be my grandpa's campfire.
How do you know?

What else could it be?

It could be the natives sparking up a barbeque
and getting ready to cook us for dinner.

There is one way to find out.

Time out.

Look, I hope you're grandfather is okay,
but my father and I are going.

We head back to the beach.

To do what?

Well, S.O.S with seashell and
may be kelp.

Kelp! There'a boat-eating, plane-eating hurricane
out there, 24/7

Who's gonna see your kelp?

Sean is absolutely right. We need to
stick together.

Once we found his grandfather,
then we use his radio to call for help.

Fine.

Just know that if we get torn
to bits I'm blaming you.

I'm blaming you too.

Nice move.

What did I do?

Seriously, what'd I say? What'd I do?

That's Sun Protection Factor 100.

Squeeze it and a sweater comes out.

That's funy, Navy man. Don't come crying to
me when you're as red as a tomato.

Do I look like I burn?

Man, that's one gooey rock.

No one move.

These aren't rocks.

They're eggs.

Get out of here, man. Why we don't crack
couple of them and mix some omlettes?

No, no. It's not a good idea.

Come on, man. We haven't had
breakfast yet!

Where there are giant eggs there
must be a giant mother.

It had to be a lizard.

Why couldn't it be snakes?

OK. We have to move quickly and carefully.

Lizard have incredible hearing and
accute sense of smell.

Let's move. Some smell.

We're literally walking on eggshells

Guys!

Don't take another step!

Papa, be careful.

Do not worry honey.

I got this. See, no problem.

Ohh, man!

Run! Run! Run!

Head to the jungle!
Faster! Faster!

Let's go! Let's go!

Let's go.

This way!

Go, go, go!
Right behind you. Hurry!

Sean!

Hey, you! Godzilla!

Oh, crap!

Come on! Come on!

Come on!
Keep moving. Come on!

Back! Back! Back!

Sean, get behind me!

Sean, backpack!

Back! Back! Back!
Hank!

Hank!
Not now, Sean. She's scared!

No, she's cold-blooded and attracted to heat!

That's emasculating.

Now what?

Now, there is only one thing left.

A Thunder Cookie

I think I just made it worse.

I hope she doesn't like Polony sur Fleur.

I hope, she doesn't like fools
pooping in pants.

Everybody, okay?

Yeah.

Don't just stand there!

Come on!

Grandpa!

This was amazing.

A pitch-perfect frill-neck lizard mating call!

They fall for it. All the time.

This is Gabato and Kailani
Their helicopter brought us here.

Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

I'm Sean's step father.
Hank Parsons.

I helped Sean crack your code.

You're the step father!
Maybe that's why it took so long.

Afterall, how hard can it be
to crack the code...

...by converting a string of Vernean
characters into a list of...

...dots and dashes?

Or you could just send the message
uncoded.

There it is. Definitive proof that
you are not an Anderson.

You know what? I think it's best
we get out of here.

Besides, after that making calls of yours she may
have an idea about making you her husband.

Witty. Good for you Henry.

The name is Hank.
It's never Henry. Just Hank.

I see you're a man of incisive decision.

Why don't you lead the way?

Actually, we want to live through
the night. Yes.

So, may be you should all
follow me. Come on.

Hank, I'm following you.

Come on Gabato, go ahead.

That's awesome!

Here we are, folks!

Come on up!
This is my base.

Welcome.

We got a working elevator, indoor plumbing...

I've even got a 75 inches, HD TV.

How did you build this stuff?

I made it out of the sail boat
that brought me here.

Old Blue Eyed Lucy.
She gave her life in the hurricane.

So that I could discover
the ever glorious mysterious island.

Smoothie?
Thank you.

Is this the radio
you used to send a signal?

Yes, I made it myself
out of an alarm clock,

some copper I mined in the hills over there
and a tea spoon.

Do you know how long
it took me to make it, Henry?

I don't know, probably little less
than... who cares?

Three months.

Do you know how long it would
take with someone like you?

Forever.

Guys, let's just contact Palau and
get out of this island.

It's not that easy, dolly. You have to wait
for the communication satellite...

...to come around in the
proper position.

How long that's gonna take?
About two weeks.

You mean we're stuck here
for two weeks?

Stuck here?
I think it would be fun.

We get know each other better.

Sean, surviving out of here is not
gonna be fun.

Plus, how do you think your mom's
gonna feel...

if we're off more than two weeks?

By the time you get back, probably
you're gonna be remarried.

Will you let him talk to you
like that?

It's okay.

Okay. So what is the plan,
Colonel Sanders?

How about you show some more
your rinky-dink trinkets...

...that are in no way gonna
get us off this island.

And is anyone else thinking
about the lizard eggs hatching?

If you're afraid of a few critters maybe
you shouldn't have come down here, Henry.

Yeah, I mean it's called mysterious island.

You should've expected some
mysterious things. It's right in the title.

Sean, I know what the book says.

Buddy, you wanted to find mysterious island
Mission accomplished.

You wanted to find your grandmother...
There she is. Mission's accomplished.

At day break we're out of here and
for the last time...

It's... Hank.

What's the hurry?

Tomorrow...

I'm gonna show you a place
that will take your breath away

Like forever?

You're gonna find out.
So, let's get some shut-eye.

It's big day tomorrow.

Good night, honey
Good night, papa

Hey, how's it going?

Apart from being stranded on this
stupid island...

...I'm just fine.
Good

Good. I was thinking you know,
sometime...

I'd like to hang out or something
if you wanted to?

I have a feeling that your idea of fun and...

...my idea of fun are two very different things.

I don't know. What are you doing
on weekends?

I collect and label molluscs.

No way! Me too.
I'm way into molluscs.

Really?
Yes - Which one is your favourite?

Mine's the Mxyzptlk.

You're not gonna believe me
but that's my favorite too.

I've made it up.
Mxyzptlk isn't a snail.

It's one of the Superman's arch enemies.

Way to slay the heart.

Getting the attention of a woman
is one of the hardest things in the world to do.

Alright. So what do I do, Casanova?

I've been waited a long time to having
this talk with you, buddy.

There are three things you need to
know about understanding girls.

Number one. Don't follow your instincts

In any other area in life, instincts will get you
there... not with women.

So whatever you think you should do,
do the opposite.

Number 2. You need to be open, sensitive.

Women don't want a man just because
he's big...

...and strong and has abs like mine. No.

They want a thinker.

They want a feeler. They want
someone who can understand them

Women want a man who is
in touch with his most inner emotions.

And the third thing is the most important of all.

It's something that women have
responded to for thousands of years.

Well, tell me.

You've got to do this...

What is that?

That is the pec pop of love...

And go on, throw a berry.

No. - Go on and throw a berry.
There is some right behind you.

Grab one and throw. Don't be afraid.
No. I'm... - They're not gonna bite.

Grab a berry!

There, go ahead. Grab a bunch, rapid fire.
Right now. - I'm not doing rapid fire.

They won't stop until you feed them

Feed them? No!
Feed them. They're hungry.

I'll feed them.
That's a boy! Come get some.

OK. You ready? Ready?
Here we go.

OK. Ready, this one's sepcial.
Just make this one count.

No way! That's awesome!

Stop encouraging him.

It is a gift.
Yes, he has a gift.

Sean, it works everytime.

Come on Gabby, get it move on.

Where's he going?

I don't know but if this goes on much
longer he's going to blow a head. Come on.

I'm moving. I'm moving.

Come on. Come on.
We're almost there.

Get ready, Gabby. I'm about to take
your breath away

Unbelievable!

How do you like grandma now?

Hello?

No one's been home for
thousands of years, Gabby.

Can anybody guess what all this is?

You know?
Do you know?

Legoland?
No.

If this is Poseidon...

Can you do this?

Atlantis.

I can't believe it.
We're standing in the lost city of Atlantis.

The same Atlantis that Verne wrote about.

Down to the last detail.

But wasn't Atlantis supposed
to be underwater?

When Verne wrote about it,
it was.

But it has a 140 years cycle
and spends half its time above the water.

And what about the other half?

This's called tectonic recurrence.

The ocean bed buckles due to volcanic
activity on the shelf...

..pushing and pulling land to surface.

Then the entire island...

...sinks back to bottom of the sea.

Nobody's ever seen this before
in this big of a scale

This is amazing.

Come with me.

I've been looking for this piece
of paradise for 30 years.

I promised your old man that we
would find it together...

But he is not here to enjoy it.

So I made sure that his son
would be.

That's why I encoded the message.

I wanted an Anderson
to see this place...

...before anyone else.

Some of them put their names on the stars...

...species, plants.

We can put our
names on this gorgeous island.

In two weeks we'll contact
the authorities to pick us up and...

...in three weeks we'll be
on the cover of TIME magazine.

Guys, we've got a problem.
What are you talking about?

See this water? It's salt water.

The only way salt water can get this far
is if it enters subsoil from below.

So?
So, this island is about to go under.

The only salt water here
is in your brain.

I analyzed the samples and
calculated the numbers.

This island isn't due to sink for 14 years.

Alexander, your numbers are wrong.

And how would you know that?

I've come across this when we were
building over run-off areas. It's

...called soil liquefaction.

Look. You can see it in the cracks in
the confining beds. All along here

...along here...

Over there, back here.

OK, you made your point.

So how long do we have?

If I had to guess...

Based on all this water...

Two, three days max.

Then what? Because
I ain't no flotation device, man.

Well, you're gonna be if
we don't figure this out

There must be some way off this island.

We could make a little boat.

The Storm around this island would chew
it up and spit it out.

I forgot something.

What about the Nautilus?

How is an exercise machine
gonna help us get out of here?

No, no, the Nautilus. Captain Nemo's
submarine built in 1870.

Well done, Sean.

Chapter 16, Verne wrote,
"It's hidden on the island."

Yes. If we make it there in time
we can ride it under the hurricane...

...all the way back to Palau.

OK. One question.
Where is it?

There is only one man
that could tell us that.

And this is Captain Nemo, himself.

Dakkar Grotto. The final resting
place of Captain Nemo.

Legend has it that his crew buried
him in there.

I'll tell you what'd better be
in there.

Nemo's Journal.

He could tell us the
location of the Nautilus.

I've never been able to
crawl in there on my own.

Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid.

I'll go.

I'm the only one who can fit there.

No way. It's too dangerous.

I's really sweet, but I don't
need your permission.

Honey... Papa loves you.

Remember the drill. Careful.
We don't know what's down there.

Honey, honey! You okay?
Fine.

I'm inside!

What was that?

That's what a sinking island
sounds like.

Help!

Hurry!

Pull her out! Pull her out!
Pull her!

Hi

Man, he had terrible handwriting.

Is that Sanskrit?
Close. It is Hindi.

Captain Nemo was from India.

He says here...

...that the Nautilus is a basalt cave
on the other side of the island

...just under the cliffs.

I know this place.

Ok. That's where we're gonna go.

And what's the best way to get there?

Now that depends.

The safest way
is around the shoreline.

But the fastest
is to cross the heart of the island.

What do you think, Hank?

I think we've got no choice.
The quickest way.

Yeah, he's right. I'm in.
Yes, but let me warn you

The heart of this island is full of
jagged mountains,

dark jungles and terrifying creatures

...who will give you nightmares.

So...
Who is up for an adventure?

Are we there, yet?

We'll get there when we get there, Gabby.

What was that?

Tectonic plates are starting to pull apart
underneath the island.

We gotta move. Let's go.
Move. Move.

Wait, what is that?

Volcanic ashes?

Looks like...
Gold.

Pure gold.

That must be the treasure Robert Louis
Stevenson was talking about in Treasure Island.

Volcanoes are made of what they erupt
so if that thing is erupting gold, then it's...

A mountain of gold.

There must be massive gold deposits everywhere.
Let's go, check it out.

Hold on.

That'll take us days out of our way
We don't have the time.

Let's make the time.

Volcanic Gold is a huge scientific
breakthrough.

I understand that
but we got to get the Nautilus.

Hank, I'm not just a little kid.

OK? I get a say on this too.
Sean...

I am responsible for you. I've never take
a chance of risking your life. - Hey, hey!

Hey! Hey! You can't tell him what to do.

You're not the boy's father.

From what I hear, you haven't been
a much of grandfather.

I have given him something to live up to.
Science, adventure, wonder.

What have you ever given him?

I've given him a lot of things, Alexander.

Essential responsibility being one of them.

Something clearly you don't have.

You're not going for that gold. We're
get out of here, end the discussion!

Sean, please.
We have to get out of this island.

Bye bye gold.

Hey, you OK?
Yeah, fine.

Just, you know, I don't need Hank trying
to tell me what to do all the time.

My dad's always trying to get involved
too but usually he ends up embarassing me.

Yes... how?

Last summer I was trying to get a job.

So, he flew all over Palau dropping...

thousands of copies of my CV's
from the helicopter.

It's been so embarassing. It's not the
worst thing to try so hard.

No.

I mean, the worst would be
if he didn't try at all.

Alexander, you're sure your compass
readings are correct?

Of course I'm. Why?

Why? Because we're down here
and we need to be all the way up there.

For every problem there is a solution
my large friend.

And I think this might be a fun one.

You think this might be a fun one, eh!

Does anybody have an umbrella?
Because apparently Mary Poppins here...

...is gonna fly to the top of the cliff.

I knew you'd be good for something.

Wait here, Henry.

Where is he going? - I don't know. But
that guy's completely out of his mind.

Oh, I most certainly am.

It turns out that mounting the bee is easy
if you don't look into its eyes.

This is so sick.

Alright. You, get down. Now!

Why would I want to get down?

Because medical care does not cover
old ladies falling off giant bees.

Please, get down.
Suit yourself.

But make sure you're wearing swimming trash

...when this place becomes
the Pacific Ocean.

Sean!

Can we fly together?

This is amazing.
Like riding stallions across the Serengeti

This is beautiful.
Talk about paradise!

Oh man!

Is that...
...bird poop?

Then, must be a giant...

...bird!

Into the trees.

It looks hungry!

This is white fury needle tail.

It feeds on worms, aphids and yes, bees.

There's another one.

Hold on!

Oy! Stay in your own lane!

Are you familiar with chicken?
These are not chickens.

No, the game.
Chicken.

I liked the way she thinks.

Not yet.

Not yet!

How good was that little buddy?
I love you man!

I love you so much!

OK. OK. Too much happy.
That's to much happy.

Kailani!

You saved me.
Yeah. Yes, I did.

Or maybe not!

Go! Go! Get out of here!

Sean, what are you doing?

Come on, bird!

Let's do this!

Sean, talk to me.

My ankle. I can't move it.

I think it's serious.
Let me look at it.

But not, not here. This part of the island
can be even more dangerous after dark.

OK. I'll get you up.
On three. One... two... three... up.

Give me your arm. OK.

Has the swelling gone down? It's dislocated
pretty badly. We might be here a while.

I'll go and get some water.

I'm going to have to pop it back in, buddy.

Well, let's do it

Alexander, I'll brace him.
Let's do it on three

Got it.

Ready?
Yes...

One...

What happened to two and three?
Yes, what happened to two and three?

Two.. three.
That wasn't so bad.

It wasn't very good.

Do we have anything for the pain?

There is nothing in here.

Alright buddy.
Here we go. Good.

Don't worry.

We have this.

No. No, no, no.

Don't worry.

I won't sing to dudes underneath
the stars, in front of cozy fires.

Not my style.

You can sing?
A little bit.

Really? The music is
nature's painkiller.

Sing a song.
No.

Hank, come on.

OK. Don't worry.
I've got something special for you.

That going to make me feel better?

Slow down.
It's gotta get in tune.

It takes a big man to play
with a little guitar.

And an even bigger one to listen.

<i>#I see trees of green#</i>

<i>Red roses too</i>

<i>I see them bloom...
for me and for you...</i>

<i>And I think to myself</i>

<i>What a wonderful world</i>

<i>I see giant bees and...</i>

<i>I could have told you</i>

<i>Don't trust Alexander...</i>

<i>He's older than Yoda.</i>

<i>And I think to myself</i>

<i>What a wonderful world.</i>

<i>The island that we stand on</i>

<i>well it's currently sinking</i>

sending those secret codes

<i>what the heck were you drinking?</i>

<i>But it's all in the past</i>

<i>we wiped the slate clean</i>

<i>We're going to find...</i>

<i>Nemo's submarine</i>

<i>And you'll think to yourself...</i>

<i>What a wonderful world</i>

That was extraordinary

What? My multiple talents?

No. After all these years finding
the elusive singing sasquatch.

No, seriously, where did you
learn to play like that?

My dad used to sing
when I was a kid.

Remind me to buy him a drink
when we get back.

Good luck finding him.

Why? Where is he?
I don't know.

He left when I was 8
and never seen him since.

At least I got a good song out of him, right?

You like him, don't you?
Who, Sean? No.

He's a little hot headed, you know,
but he's a good kid.

It will never happen between us.

I mean if we get off this island
he'll go back to America...

...move on with his life, go to college.

And I'll go back to tiny Palau.

You could go to college some day,
if that's something you really want.

And who's gonna help you at work?
Plus, we can't afford it.

Don't say that. You wanna go to college
you can go to college. OK?

I can make that happen.

I promise.
Thanks, Papa.

Hank! Hank, get up.
Something's wrong.

Everybody, up.
Where all this water come from?

It looks like the soil-liquefaction rate
tripled overnight.

What's that mean?

It means this island is sinking
faster than we thought.

I thought you said
a couple of days?

Now, more like a couple of hours.

A couple of hours?

We need to get that sub now or we're
gonna be 20.000 leagues under the sea.

Papa?

Papa?
Papa?

He's gone.
Stay calm.

Probably he's gone for a pee.

Oh, no. No!

What?

Last night he promised me he'll
send me to the college.

Now, I know what he meant.
He's going out to the mountain of gold.

Look, I got to go and get him.You guys
head to the sub.

If we're not there in time leave without us.

No way! You're not going alone.
I'll go with you.

Sean, you have dislocated ankle
and that's at least 6 km.

No, I'm fine. I can do it
It'll be okay.

No, Sean. He's right.
You're not in condition to make that trip.

She can't go alone.
Then I'll go with her.

I'm the one who called you to this island.

It's my fault you're in this quagmire.

If this map of ours is right...

then the Trident Cliffs should be about
a mile and a half in that direction.

You get that Nautilus as soon as you can
and then meet us on the shoreline.

We have only one map.

Give me the phone.

Now we have two.

Hank, well done.

Thank you... you called me Hank.
Anytime.

Be careful.

Come on, darling.

I'll see you soon.
I promise.

Ready, Sean?
Yeah.

Come on.

Gold!

My prayers have been answered.

This is Posedion's trident.
Right where it's supposed to be.

We need the cliff.
This is just shoreline.

But Nautilus is supposed to be
inside the cave right here.

Then the map is wrong.

Let me see it.

Sean, we're in the right place.

Then where is this cave?
Where is the Nautilus?

Down there.

The sea level rose over 100 feet
in the last 24 hours

I can't believe this is happening.
We're too late. It is over.

No, it's not. It's OK.
It's okay. We just got to think.

I got to think of a way to get in.

I got it.

What?
Scuba tanks.

Now we're listing the
things we don't have?

OK. A jet pack, girl friend, calligraphy paper...

No, no. Listen to me.
We just...

Calligraphy paper?
Yeah. It just popped into my head.

We still have a couple of bags, right?
Yes

So, we'll take what we salvaged from the beach...

and we'll make makeshift scuba tanks.

No short breaths, no wasted movements.

Make sure you equailize your pressure
as you go down.

You know, if we die down there
mom's gonna kill us.

Let's do this.

Papa?
Papa.

What're you doing here?
You supposed to be back in the Nautilus.

I'll meet you back there.
Papa, stop.

Stop! Papa, stop!
Baby, this is our only chance.

One chance to send you to college.

To give you a decent life. A better life!

Papa...

We have all we want.
No other needs.

Just as long as we're together.

Let's go home.
Alright. Alright. -Okay.

Double time, Gabby.

OK. It's only a 100 feet down and
we've got two minutes of air with us.

OK
Are you ready?

I'm ready. You ready?
I'm totally ready.

And I'm totally ready.
Well, I'm probably more ready than you.

No way. I'm twice ready as you are

We're procrastinating out of fear, aren't we?

Absolutely

Wait, which way you're going?

Frankly, I'm not sure.

You're not sure?
We're running out of time.

Which way is North?

This way.

No, no. It's not. It's... this way.

We get in too much magnetic friction.

What does that mean?
Means we are lost.

We made it!

The Nautilus!

Sean, give me the flashlight.

OK. Let's power this thing up
and get to the others.

How do we find the north
without a compass?

Spiders.

I already rode giant bees.
I can't get on a spider.

Spiders weave their nets facing to the south.

Guys, I think
I found our spider.

And we go to other way.

The ballast control panel
is got to be around somewhere

Where is the power switch?

I think this is it.

How do you know?
It was right there in chapter 17

Looks like someone still reads Jules Verne.

Let's fire this baby up

Come on, come on! Wake up!

The engine is dead.
We gotta get under the hood.

These batteries are 140 years old.

It's gonna need a jump start.

But that's gonna take thousands of
kilowatts of electricity.

Do you think what I'm thinking?
That's completely insane.

Exactly.

Cable's attached to the harpoon?
Yeah. - Great.

When we're done charging that thing
out there we're gonna be on our way.

OK.

I need you to come back.

Of course I'm gonna come back.
Somebody's gonna help you pilot this thing.

No.
I mean... Look...

If anybody ever asks,
I'm gonna deny that I ever said this.

I need you to come back!

I had a lot of people take off on me
in my life.

And I don't want you
to be one of them.

Before we left I told your mom that
I was gonna take care of her son.

OK? You're not just her son,
you're my family too now.

I promise you I'll come back for you.
OK?

OK?
OK.

Now...

Who's up for an adventure?

Where are they?
They left us here.

They'd better get here quick.
We're running out of real estate.

Hank, over here!

Where are you?
Where are you?

Come on, Hank.
Come on!

Where are you?

Come on, show me that
1000-watt smile.

Do it now!

Yes!

I love you Papa.
I love you baby.

Down we go!

We made it.
Not yet, we haven't.

Up, ahead!
We're gonna be blocked!

Gabato, I need you to captain us out of here.

Me?

You brought us to the island.
You can take us back. You got this.

Sean, on my signal, hit that button.

Yeah, you're right.
It's like flying my helicopter.

OK.

Hank.
Hank!

Hank!

Fire!

We made it!
We did it!

We did it!

And we're at cruise control.

Nice work.
You too.

Hey. I can't believe we actually
made it off the island.

Yeah.

Pop your pecs.

I'm not gonna pop my pecs.
Now's the perfect time. She will love it. Believe me.

Pulp it. - I'm not...
Pulp it. - I'm not gonna pop my pecs.

I'm sure she will love it.
Hey, gentlemen.

Are you two done yet?

Pop your pecs.

Thank you... for everything!

That works too.

I'm so happy right now. I don't know how this
moment could get any better.

Well, one way it could get better is if you steer us
away from this coral reef.

Good afternoon folks, and
welcome to the Gabato Luxury Tour.

If you look out the window on your left side
you will see what's known as the Pacific Ocean.

Here we go again.

That's the third times today Papa.
I'm fine.

Baby, I heard there was a 2.3 magnitude
earthquake in Ohio.

Are you anywhere near Ohio?

It is 2000 miles away.

Look, you don't need to worry
about any earthquakes here.

What about volcanoes?
No.

Giant Birds?
Bye Papa. I love you.

I love you too. Hey, can you wish
Sean happy birthday for me?

And, I may be call you later, say,
about five minutes.

Goodbye Papa.
I love you baby. Goodbye.

OK. Are we ready for the journey?

Hello.

Hello guys. Sorry, I'm late.

Hi, darling.
Good to see you.

Glad to see you.

Come here a second.
OK.

You raised a great man.

No. We are raising a great man.

Open this one first.

Post mark is Cameroon?

It's from Grandpa.

He wants to give me his present
next time he sees me.

Don't just sit there. Applaud!
Grandpa!

I can't believe you're here.

I wouldn't have missed your birthday
for the world.

I wanted to give you this.

Book?
It's not just a book.

It is a trip I want us to go on.

All of us as a family.

From the Earth to the Moon

What do you say?

I think there is only one thing
to say.

Who is up for an adventure?

No. No. No!

Oh, honey. What could possible go
wrong? It's only the moon.
