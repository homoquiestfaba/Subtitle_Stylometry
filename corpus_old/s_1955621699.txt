Your call has been forwarded

to an automated voice messaging system.

Kristy is not available.

She's not answering.

Oh my God.

That's 'cause Kristy doesn't care.

She didn't answer
your phone call either.

Well,

Do you think she's okay?

Kristy?

Do not worry about Kristy.

Kristy's fine.

What the fuck is wrong with her?

Lyndsey.

Look at you reading my mind.

Look at you suggesting not even remotely

obvious at all suggestions.

to go back over to Lyndsey?

Why would I wanna do that?

She's all the way over there.

Ashley!

There's six weeks.

James!

Yeah, why not?

What?

Why not? She won't care.

No way.

There's something wrong with her.

She's standing right in front of us.

Completely nude.

There's nothing wrong about that.

I'm serious.

Hey guys, I'm really
drunk right now, but,

why is Kristy naked?

Get away from her!

Please don't worry,

I'm not gonna fuck him anymore!

I wasn't going to fuck you.

Yeah you were.

I don't want your first
time to be in a sleeping bag.

You kidding me?
