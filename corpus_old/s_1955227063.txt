[Police sirens]

Out of my way.

Out of my way!


[Police sirens]

[Police sirens]

[Police sirens]

[Tires squealing]

[Breathing heavily]

WOMAN: Hi.

Do I know you?

Are you looking for something?

No!

Police!

Drop your weapon!

Hands in the air,
where I can see them.

Back off!

Back off!


This is car 315.

Suspect has taken a female
Caucasian as hostage.

Where the fuck
did she come from?

Why should I keep
my hands in the air?

Give it up.

You're completely surrounded.

There's nowhere to run.

Give yourself up and let her go.

Just back off,
you motherfuckers!

There's nowhere to go.

Back off, you motherfuckers!

Just back off, or
I'll blow her brains

Out if you don't do what I say.

Do it!

Do it!

Do it!

Do it!

OK.

We'll back off.

You came out of that house?

Take me to a safe place.

Hurry.

What's keeping you?

I can't reach it.

I have suspect
in a clear range.

Ask permission to fire.

Permission granted.


You cunts!

Don't shoot.

You want more dead bodies?

I'll give you more.

It makes no fucking
difference to me.

Did I make myself clear?


I said, did I make myself clear?

Whatever you do, don't shoot.

The suspect is
entering the house.

We're waiting for instructions.

What's keeping you?

I'm looking for
the fucking key.

Oh shit.

Not again.

Ahh.
Hurry.

Close the door.

What the hell were you
doing in this place?

I live here.

Yeah, sure.

Oh, you mother... ahh!

Take me to a room where
I can see everything

That's going on outside.

Yes.

There's a room... the bedroom.

There's the stairs to the attic.

Take me there now.

Ahh.

Come on.

Hurry up.

I can't see shit from here.

I told you I needed a room
where I could see everything.

I have to know what
those bastards are up to.

Who do you think you're
messing with, eh?

Tell me.

Tell me, bitch!


Great.

Ressler.

Yeah.

Good morning, sir.

Who is he?

Jason Goodis, a bank robber.

He popped three men at
the First General Bank.

And who is she?

We don't know... yet.

Right.

You fucking pervert.

Leave me alone.

OFFICER WALLS (ON
MEGAPHONE): Goodis, my name

Is Police Officer
Walls, and next to me

Is Mr. Carl Ressler,
the official negotiator.

He'll be taking over.

Let me repeat... you're
completely surrounded.

There's no escape.

Drop your weapons and free
the hostage, and nobody

Will get hurt.

Don't shoot, officer.

Please.

Don't shoot.

Oh, I'll release the hostage.

How do you want her,
eat here or take away?


Please!

Get me out of here!

Shut the fuck up.

If you ever get out of here,
it'll be dead... or alive,

If you are very, very quiet.

It makes no difference to me!

Ahh.

Maybe you need something
that will help you remember

To keep your mouth shut.

I really hate it when
I'm not taken seriously.

This is Sniper One.

There's movement
on the upper floor.

OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Roger, Sniper One.

Keep me posted.

Don't say "cheese"
when you smile.

Holy shit.

OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Sniper One, don't shoot.

OK, Ressler.

Here's the deal.

I want a car to take
me to the airport.

In the trunk, there's a
neat million in used bills.

Do you need a driver?

I have my driver's
license, Ressler.

You can save your breath.

You have one hour.

After that, I start working
on the girl... end of show.

Close the curtains.


Ah!

Nothing on the hostage.

The neighbors hardly know her.

Some say she lives
in that room, others

Say that she's the caretaker.

The fact is, she sometimes
brings men there.

No known acquaintances, family,
friends, only a name... Ella.

Mmm.

I see.

The whole neighborhood
is fucking her,

And... and, of course,
nobody knows her.

Makes sense.

AnD there's no rich daddy
to pay the bill, huh?

What's wrong with you?

Ella... I remember her.

You know the girl?

You met her somewhere?

I don't know.

It's her eyes.

Hey, you weren't one of those
guys fucking her, are you?

It's nothing like that at all.

Come on.

We won't tell your wife.

I met her, but
I can't remember.

It's... it's that house.

She was a suspect,
uh... a victim.

Shit.

I can't remember.

Only those hypnotizing eyes.

Crazy son of a bitch.


Stefan, are you all right?

Never look at an
unfinished work.

I know it means bad luck.

You always say that.


No.

Come on, Stevie.

You've been painting my
portrait for three months now.

Soon you'll have to
paint extra wrinkles.

Please.

Don't.

Please.

Shh.

I'll tell you one thing, lady.

The first thing you lose is
that big, waggy tongue of yours.

Maybe I'll cut it
out now and throw it

To them, just so they'll
know I'm really serious.

And don't think... just
don't think for one fucking

Split second that I'm bluffing.

My god, is this blood?

This thing looks like it
came from a slaughterhouse.

I always liked
slaughterhouses, you know...

All those tools, and blood.

Blood everywhere.

Take care that your
blood isn't on here soon.

I'd rather enjoy cutting you
up into a thousand pieces...

Much more so than
I would a steer.

This tool can come
in handy, too.

OFFICER WALCE (ON MEGAPHONE):
Goodis, listen to me.

There's a delay with the plan.

We need to know
your destination.

Now, Mr. Ressler would
like to talk to you.

Do you hear me?

Please come near the window.

OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Sniper One, shoot

Whenever you have a clear shot.

Don't move.

Cut the crap, Ressler, or
I'll start to cut her up now.

In 30 minutes, you
can expect her tongue.

Discussion closed, Ressler.

Anything you want to say?

Any last words?

Now is the time.

Please.

Let me explain.

This is not what it seems.

Please.

I know perfectly well that
things are not what they seem.

After all, I've been listening
to your lies long enough.

At least you know now, Dad.

At least try to keep
your lies straight,

And do not insult
my intelligence.

There is only one
thing I know for sure.

You've been painting very hard.

No!

Stop it!

Leave him alone.

No!

No!

Stop it, please.


No!

Ahh.

No!


Ahh.

Ahh.

Ahh.

WOMAN: [screaming]
Please, stop it!

Please!

No.

No.

No.

Please.

Stop it.

No.

Stop it, now.

How long have you been his
mother, for three months?

And that's the result?

How long have you
been fucking him... us?

Did you compare the two of us?

I have never made
love to Stefan.

You're a liar.

But even then, it's not hard
to decide who's the best lover.

After all, I was almost
playing the nurse with you.

Maybe this will beat
some sense into you.

No.


I'll break every bone in
your miserable body, you

Fucking shit.

No!

You'll pay for every kiss.

You'll fucking bleed
where she touched you.



Ahh!

Ahh.


Ahh.

MAN: [moaning]


Ahh!

Ahh!

MAN: Ahh!

No.

No.

No!

Ow, that hurts.

It fucking hurts.

Ah.

I was thinking...
That is, before you

Scared the shit out of me.

Aren't you interested
in what I was thinking?

You should be, as it
might concern you.

Come on.

Ask me what I was thinking.

Come on!
Ah!

Ask me what I was thinking.

What?

What were you thinking?

I saw myself on the way to
paradise for all of the money

I'll be getting for you.

But you know what?

It was so damn expensive.

A waiter's tip there would
buy a guy a classy girl here.

I had to look for a stupid job.

I had to wash dishes to survive.

And the only trouble
with paradise

Is there's nowhere
to go from there.

You know?

Ahh.

Come on, keep up the
conversation for Christ

Sakes, or I'll cut
your tongue out now.

OK.

So what are you going to do?

I

Think I didn't ask
enough money for you.

You're worth a lot more.

So, there are two solutions.

What?

What solutions?

I can ask [inaudible]
for more money.

I don't think they'll listen.

But I'll try.

Don't you fucking touch me!

Keep your damn hands off me.

Ah.

Ressler, are you listening?

Ressler, for Christ's sakes.

RESSLER (ON MEGAPHONE):
I'm listening.

The price is going up, Ressler.

I want another 500 grand.

She is still in good
health, after all.

We have a nice chat
every now and then.

Fuck.

You know, we need more time.

Yeah right.

I'm getting harsh, Ressler.

Get me the rest of the money!

End of discussion.

The other solution is
to stick with the lower

Sum of $1 million, and take the
rest out in trade, so to speak.

Your lover?

You might say he's my ex.

Divorced?

Men just disappear, you know.

You really live
here, don't you?

I have to take
care of the house.

You did a good job.

It's a big house
to keep [inaudible].

Why don't you sell it?

Nobody wants it.

It has history.

It sounds like a
bedtime story, but one

That will keep you awake.

Try me.

Read the papers.

Ella.

Is that your name?

It's nice.

It kind of fits, too.

This is really something.

What the fuck?

Do you still want to hear
my sales pitch for the house?

Shut up.

Shut the hell up.

And I thought my
situation was ill.

But you look like you survived.

Oh, you learn how to survive
after things go wrong.

Huh.

I hope I have a chance
to survive this.

I'm sure you will.

They don't want anything
to happen to me.

You know, you look like
someone I used to know.

Really?

How is she now?

RESSLER (ON MEGAPHONE): Goodis.

You hear me?

The car will be
here in one hour.

The ransom money
will be in the trunk.

That's too fucking long!

Don't look at me like that.

This shit is really
getting to me.

Today is just one
fucked up mess.

It began with the guard
at the First General.

He wasn't supposed to be there.

I just panicked and shot him.

I had to!

And then you got in the way.

I'm supposed to be here.

I live here, you know.

How could you stay after
all that's happened here?

There's nowhere else to go.

I've been hearing that
my whole fucking life.

I never want to hear that again.

So where do you want to go?

Out of here.

This place depresses me.

Is there someplace where we can
go where they can't get at me?

The backyard.

Shit.

Walls everywhere.

Nowhere to run.

Suspect is in the backyard.

Come on.

Move.

Where the hell did he go.

What the hell do you
think you're doing?

Ah.

There you are.

Shit.

Too many trees.

We don't want it
to go off, do we?

Can we put it away?

You'll never regret the
moment you saved my tongue.

Then don't use it to talk.

RESSLER (ON RADIO): Sniper One.

Sniper One.

Come in, Sniper One.

What's your status?

Fuck.

Sir, I just missed the target.

These fuckers think they
got me, but they're wrong.

I'm only starting, for real.

Mmm.

Right.

What are you doing, Ella?

What the hell are you doing?

Stop it.

Stop it, you crazy bitch.

Stop it or I'll
blow your head off.

Back to the room.

Now.

RESSLER (ON RADIO): Have you
any idea what's going on?

I don't think we've seen the
last of the crazy shit today,

Sir.

Police officer is entering
the house through one

Of the attic windows.

[Rustling noise]

Oh, no, you're not going
to take me like that.

Die, you motherfucker!


Die!


Die! [Gunshot]

No!

No!

Die!

Die!

Die, you motherfucker!


You'll never get me.

I [inaudible].

You'll never get me.

You hear that, Ressler?

You'll never get me!


I've lost track of the
intruding police officer.

WOMAN: No!

No!

No!

No!


When is your father going to
do something about that door?

Soon it won't open at all.

Oh my god, my feet
are killing me.

And where's that worthless
housekeeper, anyway?

Ella has her qualities.

She's not just the housekeeper.

WOMAN: Yeah.

You're way too friendly
with that girl.


Leer!

Leer!
Leer!

Steven!

Where the hell are you both?

Answer me, for Christ's sake!

Ahh!

GIRL: [inaudible].

Mother, [inaudible]?

Mother, don't!

Ahh!

Ahh!

Ahh!


Mother!

Shit.

The fucking door won't open!

Dad!

Dad! Where the fuck are you?

Help us!
Help us!

WOMAN: [screaming]

GIRL: [inaudible].

Help us!

Dad, help us!

For Heaven's sake!

Ahh!

Come on, Mother.


Dad!

Dad!

Dad!

Where are you?

Dad!


Oh, shit.

We have to go back.

Mother, shut the fuck up!


Oh god.

Ahh!

You.

Mother, don't!

Ella, don't!

Ahh!

Ahh.

Ahh.


You always liked me, huh?

You always treated me as part
of the family, didn't you?

And now you're dying.

And you don't
deserve that, do you?

And all I ever wanted was
to be part of your family.

But from now on, I will take
care of you and your family.

I'll be the caretaker
of the house.

I promise you that I will
lead you and your family

Through the frontiers
of death until the world

Of eternal light.

Your heart is still beating.

You're dead now.

It's time for you and
your family to follow me...

One happy family beyond death.


No!

No!

No!

No!

Ahh!

No!

Oh my god.

What are you doing?

Who are you?

Oh, Jesus.

That's disgusting.

We lost contact
with our man inside,

And our sniper lost visual, too.

What should we do now?

Prepare for assault.

You're insane.

Don't look at me like that.

Stop, or I'll blow your
fucking brains out.

Stop this.

Oh, god, Ella.

Stop it.

Obey me, for Christ sakes.

Obey me!

No.

You obey me.

You're no longer in
control of things.

Do you hear me?

You obey me.

You obey me!

You obey me.




Now you'll see who's
in control around here.

You too will become
part of the family.


You will obey me.


You'll have the time of
your life here, Goodis.




my eternal love.


Goodis, like all of
the men I bring here,

Your flesh and blood brings
my family back to life.


Stop, or I'll blow
your ugly face off!

Yes, my love.


Stay where you are!


Die motherfucker, die!

Ah.

He's all yours.


Yeah.

Show him who's the master
of this fucking house!

Ahh!
Ahh!

WOMAN: Show him!

Ahh!

[Sucking noise]


Ahh!

Ahh!



Shit.

The police.

He's trying to escape
through the garden!

Damnit.

Where's that
fucking squad team?

Ah.

Ah.

Ah.

Ah!

Ahh.

Ahh.

Ah.

They ran through the garden.

Ahh.

Ahh.

Ahh.

Ah.

Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

Ahh.

[Zombie noises]

Please help me!

They're everywhere.

Stay where you are and
put your hands in the air.

Upstairs.

They're in the cellar.

This place is Hell.

Just get me out of here.


Don't go upstairs.

Don't go in the cellar!

OFFICER: Put your
hands in the air.


Ahh.

Ah.

Ah.

Ahh.

[Zombie noises]

What the fuck?


Jesus.

What the hell are
those creatures?

It's just a reunion, finally.

family apart, but I

Brought it together again.



Ah!

Ahh!

Squad leader, answer me.

Answer me.

Ahh!

Ahh!

Ahh!

Ahh.

MAN: [choking]

Leo, please forgive me.

Please forgive me.

Hey.

Please.

I want to guard

Bite me.

Make me happy.

Bite me.

Please, forgive me.

Leo, forgive me.

I want to be part
of the family again.

Bite me!

Bite me! [Crying] Bite me.

Bite me!


Do you hear me?

You've punished me enough.

You knew I would have
chosen you over your son.

Nothing ever
happened between us.

Please, Leo.

Bite me.

Take me to your family.

Hey.

Bite me.

Bite me!

Please.

Please.

Hey.

I always liked you.

I saved you.

Please.

Give me eternal life.

Please, Lucy.

Lucy, please.

Is that your gratitude?

I brought you all these men.

They gave you life after
death, and now... now you

Won't even give me a chance?

life has its limitations.

Ah.

No.

No.

Oh god.

Leo.

Leo.

I'm sorry.

Oh, god.

What have I done?

No.

You cannot leave this house.

I order you to stay
inside the house.

Obey me.

Oh, yes.

Bite me, Stefan.
Bite me.

No.

No!

No!

No.

No.

Why, Stefan?

I want to love you.

Ah.

What the hell?

Ressler, you better
check this out.

[Breathing heavily]

Over there.

Who the hell are those guys?

Ah.


Get away!

[Zombie noises]




Ahh!

Ahh!

Ahh!
Ahh!

Ahh!

[Zombie noises]

[Zombie noises]


[Zombie noises]

Uh!

I'm sorry.

Eternal life only
lasted a few moments.

Ah.

[Zombie noises]

Now play time is over,
you motherfuckers.

Back off, you loser.

Ah.

No!

ugly son of a bitch!

After all I did to
correct my mistake,

And now you let me down!

You betrayed me.

Do you hear me?

You betrayed me.

You [inaudible] regret, now.

I don't want to be part
of your bloody family.

I want [inaudible].

Ah.


Ahh.

Ahh.

Ahh!


Ahh.

You won't need a
new haircut anymore.

Oh, shit.

Where is that son of a bitch?

Hmm.

A thinner acid...
Just what I need

For that stupid living painting.

Ah.
Oh.

Ahh.

You son of a bitch!

Ahh.

Ahh.


Oh, no.

Not this one.

[Drill sounds]

I'm really getting
tired of this.

[Drill sounds]

Ah.

Ahh!

Ah.

Ahh.


I've really had enough of you.

These tools really
came in handy.

Now, cleaning time.

Hi.

Do I know you?
