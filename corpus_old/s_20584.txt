Captain, I'd like to request that
it be me who's the attorney ...

Captain, I'd like to request that
it be me who's the attorney ...

That it be myself who's assigned ...
No, that it be I who am assigned ...

That it be / who am assigned?
That's confidence inspiring!

Good grammar, there!

Lieutenant Commander GaIloway.
Captain West is expecting you.

Jo, come on in.

Lt. Commander GaIloway.
You know Commander Lawrence?

I appreciate you seeing me.
WiII you sit down? Have a seat!

We've had some trouble in Cuba?
Yes, sir. Last Friday.

Corporal Dawson and Private Downey
assauIted Private WiIliam Santiago.

Santiago died in hospital
an hour Iater.

NavaI InteIligence Service says
the two men -

wanted to stop Santiago naming
Dawson in a fenceline shooting.

The hearing's at 1600 hours.
What's the probIem?

They're both model marines.
Santiago was a screw-up.

It sounds like a Code Red.
Christ!

I'd Iike to have them
assigned counsel.

Someone who has both the legal skiII
and a famiIiarity with the military.

I'd Iike to suggest that
l be the one who that ...

... that it be me who is assigned
to represent them, myself.

Why don't you get a cup of coffee?
I'm fine, sir.

Leave the room, so we can
talk about you behind your back.

Do Code Reds stiII go on?
Who knows what goes on there?

We'd better find out soon.
What about this Commander Galloway?

She's been working a desk at
Internal Affairs for a year.

She did three cases in two years.
She's not very fast!

She's not a Iitigator.
But she's a great investigator!

I know: aII passion,
no street smarts. Bring her back in.

Jo.

We'lI have them moved here
and assigned counsel.

But ... not me?

You're too valuable to waste -

on a five-minute plea bargain
and a week's paperwork.

There might be more involved ...
Division wiII find the right man.

Let's go, Iet's get two!

Sorry.
Look the baII into your gIove.

Keep your eyes open!
Then you'II have a better chance.

Kaffee!
You seem distraught.

You're stalling
on the McDermott case.

We do it now,
or I'll hang him from a yardarm!

Do we hang peopIe from yardarms?
I don't think so.

Sherby doesn't think
we do that any more.

I'm charging him with possession.
Plead guilty and he'lI get 30 days.

it was oregano!
He thought it was marijuana.

He's a moron. That's not iIIegaI.

I'm gonna charge him!
With possession of a condiment?

I'll file a motion to dismiss.
You won't get it!

I'll ask for an evidentiary ruIing,
then Iook for bail reIease ...

You'II get three months' paperwork
because he smoked a bag of oregano.

20 days in the brig!
15 days' restricted duty.

Why am I agreeing?
You have wisdom beyond your years.

Good morning ...
How's the baby, Sam?

She'II say her first word soon.
How can you telI?

She just Iooks like
she has something to say.

Sorry I'm Iate.
l won't ask you for a bad excuse.

Thank you, sir.
This first one's for you.

You're moving up in the worId.
Division wants you.

To do what?
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

A Marine Corporal named Dawson
fired over the fenceline into Cuba.

What's a fenceline?

Between good guys and bad guys.
Teacher's pet.

Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigators.

Dawson and Private Louden Downey -

tie Santiago up,
and stuff a rag down his throat.

An hour Iater, he's dead.
There was a toxin on the rag.

They poisoned the rag?
Not according to them.

They get here tomorrow.
On Wednesday, 0600, you fly to Cuba.

In the meantime, go and see
Lt. Commander JoAnne GalIoway.

Any questions?
I fIy at 0600? ln the morning?

We'lI go by the book,
so I'm assigning co-counseI.

Any voIunteers?
No. l've a stack of papers to do.

Work with Kaffee.
For just four days?

Doing various administrative ...
things.

In other words, no responsibilities?
My kind of case!

Right, but I need that report
by Wednesday.

Hi!
Hold on ... Hi!

DanieI Kaffee.
I was toId to meet ...

...Lieutenant Commander GaIloway.

About a briefing.
l'II calI you back.

You're the attorney?
Yes, and this is Sam Weinberg.

l have no responsibiIities.
Have a seat.

Have you been in the Navy long?
Nine months now.

And when did you graduate?
A year ago.

I see.
Have I done something wrong?

When I asked for counsel,
I hoped to be taken seriously.

No offence taken.

He's our best Iitigator. He obtained
44 plea bargains in nine months.

AImost got my steak knives.
Have you ever been in court?

I had my licence suspended ...
They need a priest, not a Iawyer.

No, they'II need a Iawyer.

Dawson's famiIy has been contacted.
Downey just has his aunt.

ShaIl I contact her?
Sure, if you feeI Iike it.

You'Il be seeing CoIoneI Jessep.
You've heard of him?

Who hasn't?

The papers say he's tipped for
the NationaI Security CounciI.

Santiago sent these from GlTMO.
That's Guantanamo Bay.

He wrote to aII the senior officers,
even his senator.

He wanted a transfer.
No one Iistened. Are you with me?

Then he offered to trade information
about the shooting for a transfer.

Right. Is that aII?

It seems your cIient had
a motive to kiII Santiago.

Got you! And Santiago is ... who?
The victim.

These Ietters are not fIattering
about Marine Corps life?

And an investigation might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

CoIoneI Jessep ...
12 years.

If they drop ''conspiracy'' and
''conduct unbecoming''.

You haven't done anything yet!
Impressive, huh?

You'll have to go deeper.
-Do you have jurisdiction here?

My job is to make sure
you do your job.

So my jurisdiction's in your face.

Read the Ietters.
Report when you return from Cuba.

Dismissed!
I aIways forget that part.

He's preoccupied.
He has a basebaII game next week.

TeIl him not to get cute.
Guantamo marines are fanaticaI.

About what?
About being marines.

"My name is PFC Wi//iam Santiago -

of Rifle Security Company
Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.

I am writing to inform you ofmy
problems here in Cuba.

I've faIIen out of runs before,
because of dizziness or nausea.

On May 18th, I'd fa//en back about
20 yards going down a rocky hilI.

My sergeant pushed me down the hiI/,
then I saw a/I bIack and feII down.

The hospitaI said
it was heat exhaustion.

I ask your help.
I need a transfer out of RSC.

SincereIy, PFC Wi//iam T. Santiago,
US Marines. "

"PS: In exchange for my transfer, -

I have information about
the shooting on August 2nd. "

Who the fuck is
PFC WiIIiam T. Santiago?

He's in 2nd PIatoon Bravo, sir.

ApparentIy he's not happy here
at Shangri-la.

He's asked everyone but
Santa Claus for a transfer.

Now he's telling taIes about a
fenceIine shooting. Matthew?

I'm appalIed, sir.
You're appalIed.

This kid ratted on a member of his
unit, to say nothing of the fact -

that he's a US marine
who can't run without colIapsing.

What is going on in Bravo company?
Can we discuss it in private?

l can handIe this situation, sir.

Like you handIed Curtis BeII?
Don't interrupt, I'm your superior!

And I'm yours, Matthew.
What are we going to do about this?

He should be transferred at once.
He's that bad?

If word of this Ietter gets out,
he'Il get his ass whipped.

Transfer Santiago? You're right.
Yes, that's the thing to do.

Wait! I've got a better idea.

Let's transfer the whoIe squad.

No, Iet's transfer
the whole division off the base.

Jon, go and teII the boys
to pack their bags.

Tom!

Get me the President. We're
surrendering our position in Cuba.

Wait a minute, Tom. Maybe we
shouId consider this for a second.

Dismissed, Tom.

I'm just spit-baIIing here, -

but maybe it's our responsibiIity
to train Santiago?

Maybe we have a responsibility
to this country to see -

that those protecting it
are trained professionals.

I think I read that somewhere once.

And I'm thinking, CoIoneI, that your
idea of transferring Santiago, -

whiIe expeditious and painIess, -

might not be quite
the American Way?

Santiago stays where he is.

We're going to train the lad.
Jon, you're in charge.

If Santiago doesn't get 4.6, 4.6
in his next proficiency report, -

I'm going to bIame you.
And then I'll kiII you.

I think that's a mistake, CoIoneI.

Matthew, I think
I'II have that word in private now.

That's alI. Meet me at the ''O"' cIub.
We'lI talk about WiIIiam's training.

I'lI weIcome your suggestions.
Dismissed.

Matthew, sit down. PIease.

What do you think of Kendrick?
I don't think my opinion ...

I think he's a bit of a weaseI.

But he's a very good officer, and
we agree on how to do our job.

Our business is saving Iives.
We have to take that seriously.

I believe that if we transfer a
marine who is not up to the job, -

we put lives in danger.
Sit down, Matthew.

We went to the Aoademy together,
served in Vietnam together.

But I've been promoted with
more speed and success than you.

If that causes you tension or
embarrassment, I don't give a shit.

Our business is saving Iives,
Lieutenant CoIonel Markinson.

Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

AII the paperwork's in order.
Step over there.

HaI, is this Washington D.C.?
AlI right, Iet's move.

I wanted to taIk to you
about Dawson and Downey.

Say again?
Dawson and Downey.

The names seem famiIiar, but ...
Your cIients?

The Cuba thing! Oh yeah, right.

I've done something wrong again.

Why are they sitting in jaiI
whiIe you're hitting a baII?

We need to practice.
That wasn't funny.

WouId you be insulted
if I recommended another counseI?

Why?
I don't think you're up to it.

You don't even know me! It usuaIIy
takes people hours to find that out.

That was funny!

You're wrong. l do know you.

DanieI AIistair Kaffee,
born June 8th, 1964, in Boston.

Son of LioneI Kaffee, former
Attorney-GeneraI, died 1985.

You went to Harvard, then joined the
Navy, because your father wanted it.

You're just treading water here
until you get a reaI job.

But that's fine, l won't telI.

But if you handIe this case in your
usuaI sIick manner, -

then something's gonna get missed.

I can't Iet Dawson and Downey
sit in jaiI -

because you chose
the path of Ieast resistance.

Wow!
l"m sexuaIIy aroused, Commander!

I don't think it was murder.
There was no intent.

Santiago asphyxiated
from acute lactic acidosis.

It was suggestive of poison.
Whatever that means, it sounds bad.

When he died, the doctor
didn't know the reason.

Two hours Iater, he said poison.
Was it Prof. PIumb in the Iibrary?

I'Il see your supervisor.

He's in the big white house
with the piIlars.

I don't think you'II have much Iuok.
Division must think I'm good.

l appreciate your interest and
enthusiasm, but I can handle things.

Do you know what a Code Red is?

What a pity.

Officer on deck, ten-hut!

CorporaI Dawson, sir!
RSC Company Windward!

You haven't been ''working
weII with others'', HaroId!

PFC Louden Downey, sir!

I'm DanieI Kaffee,
this is Sam Weinberg. Sit down.

This your signature? Don't say sir.
Is this yours ?

Sir,yes, sir!
At least don't say it twice.

What's a Code Red?
It's a discipIinary action.

If a marine faIIs out of Iine,
the others get him on track.

What's the garden variety?
Sir?

You say ''sir"' and l look for
my father. Danny, DanieI Kaffee.

What's a typicaI Code Red?

If a marine won't bathe,
the men give him a GI shower.

And what's that?
Scrub brushes, steeI wooI.

Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

Does he ever taIk?

He wiII answer any direct question.

Was there poison on the rag?
No, sir.

Turpentine, anti-freeze?
We were going to shave his head.

When suddenly ...
BIood was dripping down his mouth.

There was blood alI over his face,
so Dawson caIIed the ambuIance.

Did anyone see you caII it?
No, sir.

Were you there when it arrived?
Yes, and we were arrested.

Did you on Aug. 2nd fire a shot
across the fenceIine into Cuba?

Yes, sir. My mirror engaged, sir.

Every American sentry has
a Cuban counterpart. His '"mirror''.

Santiago's Ietter says
you fired iIIegalIy.

He says the ''mirror''
never made a move.

HaroId ...?
You see what I'm getting at?

Why eIse wouId you
give him a Code Red?

He broke the chain of command.
He went outside his unit.

He shouId have spoken to me first,
then his sergeant ...

AII right.
Did you intend to kiIl Santiago?

No sir, to train him!
Train him to do what?

To think of his unit before himself.
To respect the code.

What's the code?
Unit, Corps, God, Country!

Pardon?
Unit, Corps, God, Country ... sir.

The government
wants to charge you with murder.

You want me to telI the prosecutor
'Unit, Corps, God, Country' ?

That's our code, sir.

That's your code.
We'II be back.

You need anything? Books, papers?
No thank you, sir!

There's a concept
you'd better get used to.

Sir?
I'm the onIy friend you've got.

WeIcome to the big time!
You think so?

I hope you're better at Iaw
than at softbaII.

UnfortunateIy l pIay softbaII best.
I'm off to Cuba, JaneIIe!

Say hi to Castro for me.

If they pIead guiIty
they get 20 years and serve haIf.

12. They caIIed the ambuIance.
They kilIed a marine.

The Iab says maybe
the rag was poisoned.

The Chief of lnternaI Medicine
says he's sure.

What do you know about Code Reds?
Oh, man ...

Are we off the record?

You'II get the 12 years.
But you shouId know -

Lieutenant Kendrick specificaIIy
told the men not to touch Santiago.

We playing hoops tomorrow?
Do we have a deaI?

I'lI talk to you when I get back.

Any Iuck getting me repIaced?
Everyone's your friend.

Listen, l came to make peace.
What do you say, friends?

I took Downey
the comic books he wanted.

He hardIy knows
why he's been arrested.

Look, Commander ...
CaII me JoAnne. Or Jo.

You contact them again,
I'Il have you disbarred. Friends?

I had authorization
from Ginny MiIIer, his aunt.

Aunt Ginny authorized you?
I caIled her.

We spoke for an hour.
You were authorized by Aunt Ginny.

it's within my province.
We can hoId the triaI in her barn.

I'Ii sew the costumes,
UncIe Goober can be judge.

I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

''And the hits just keep on coming.''

How's it going, Luther?
Another day, another doIIar.

PIay as they lay.
What goes around comes around.

I got my heaIth.
You got everything. See you!

Not if I see you first.

You're my witness: the baby spoke.
She said a word.

She made a sound.
Come on! It was definiteIy a word.

You heard her.
She pointed and said ''Pa''.

She was pointing at a mailbox.
Yes. ''Pa! Look, a maiIbox.''

Jack Ross offered me the 12 years.
That's what you wanted, right?

I mean ... l guess I'II take it.
So ..?

It took about 45 seconds.
Take the 12 years, it's a gift.

You don't beIieve them.
You think they shouId get life.

I beIieve every word of their story,
and I think they shouId get Iife.

See you tomorrow.

Don't forget to wear the whites!
I don't Iike them.

We're going to Cuba.
You got Dramamine?

That keeps you cooI?
No, but you get airsick.

It's because l'm afraid of crashing.
Dramamine won't help.

I got some oregano,
l hear that works.

Ross said a strange thing,
just before I Ieft.

He said Lt. Kendrick had toId
the men not to touch Santiago.

So?
I don't even know who Kendrick is.

What the heII. See you tomorrow.

I'm Corporal Barnes, l'II escort you
to the Windward side of the base.

l have camoufIage jackets,
I suggest you wear them.

We're going cIose to the fenceIine.

lf the Cubans see an officer in
white they might take a shot.

Good caII, Sam.

We'II just take the ferry.

We're taking a boat?
Across the bay.

No one mentioned a boat.
l'm just not crazy about them.

Jesus Christ, you're in the Navy!
Nobody likes her very much.

Nathan Jessep. Come on in.

DanieI Kaffee, attorney.

Lt. Commander
JoAnne GaIIoway.

Observing and evaluating.
Lt. Weinberg, my assistant.

This is CoIoneI Markinson,
and PIatoon Leader Lt. Kendrick.

Lieutenant Kaffee.

I met your father once.
He spoke at my high schooI.

LioneI Kaffee?
Yes, sir.

Jon, this man's dad
once made a lot of enemies.

Jefferson versus
Madison County SchooI District.

They didn"t want a bIack girI
in a white school.

Lionel Kaffee said,
''We'll see about that.''

How the heII is your dad, Danny?
He passed away seven years ago.

Don't l feel Iike an asshoIe!
Not at aII, sir.

What can we do for you, Danny?
Not much, sir.

This is reaIIy just a formaIity.

They insist we interview everyone.
JAG Corps can be demanding.

Jon'II show you what you want to
see, then we can meet for lunch.

You met with the men that afternoon.
What did you say?

I toId them we had an informer, -

but that Private Santiago
was not to be harmed.

What time was that?
1600.

That's four o'cIock.

We shouId make sure somebody
gets this to his parents.

Lt. Kendrick, may I caIl you Jon?
No.

Have l offended you?
No, I Iike aII you Navy boys.

When we have to fight,
you feIIas aIways give us a ride.

Do you think he was murdered?

I beIieve in God and Jesus Christ,
so I'lI say this:

Santiago's death is a tragedy.

But he died because he had no code,
and no honour. And God was watching.

How do you feeI about that theory?
Sounds good.

Are you going to investigate,
or just take the guided tour?

I'm pacing myseIf.

They ran around
looking for something white to wave.

Some of them surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

WaIk softly and carry an armoured
tank division, I aIways say.

That was delicious.

l do have to ask some questions.
Shoot!

An NIS agent told you that Santiago
knew about a fenceIine shooting.

Santiago was going to say who did it
in exchange for a transfer.

If you feel there are any detaiIs
I'm missing, teIl me.

Thank you.

You calIed CoIoneI Markinson and
Lt. Kendrick into your office. And?

We agreed that for his own safety
he should be transferred.

Santiago was set to be transferred?

On the first flight to the States.
0600 next morning.

Five hours too late, it turned out.

AlI right, that's aIl.
Thanks very much for your time.

The corporal wiIl drive you back.

Wait, I've got some questions.
No, you don't. No!

On the morning of the death,
did you meet Dr. Stone?

Of course. One of my men was dead.
You see? He was dead. Let's go.

Have you ever heard of Code Red?
I've heard the term, yes.

In February, you received a memo
from the FIeet Commander -

warning against enIisted men
discipIining their own?

Whoever wrote that memo has never
Iooked down a Cuban AK-47 rifIe.

However, l gave it due attention.
What is your point, Jo?

She has no point,
it's part of her charm. Goodbye!

My point is that I think
Code Reds stiIl go on. Do they?

He doesn't need to answer that.
Yes, he does.

CoIoneI?

You know, it just hit me.
She outranks you, Danny!

I want to teIl you something.
Listen welI.

You're a very Iucky man.

There is nothing sexier then a woman
you have to saIute in the morning.

Promote 'em aII, I say!

If you've never had a blowjob
from a superior officer, -

you've missed the best in Iife.
Code Reds are stiII condoned here?

But I'Il just take coId showers
tiII they eIect some gaI president.

I need an answer to my question.
Watch your tone, Commander.

I'm a fair guy, but this
fucking heat makes me crazy.

You asked me about Code Reds.
On the record, I discourage it.

Off the record,
it's an invaluable part of training.

If it goes on without my knowIedge,
so be it. That's how I run my unit.

If you want to investigate me,
take your chances.

I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kiIl me.

So don't think you can come
down here and make me nervous.

Let's go.

CoIoneI, I just need a copy
of the transfer order.

Santiago's transfer order.
For the fiIe.

For the fiIe?
Yeah.

Of course you can have a copy.
I'm here to help any way l can.

You beIieve that, don't you, Danny?
That l'II heIp any way I can?

The corporaI wiIl take you by
PersonneI and get it for you.

But you have to ask me nicely.

I beg your pardon?
You have to ask me niceIy.

I can take buIIets, bombs and bIood.
I don't want money or medaIs.

What I do want is for you, with your
faggoty uniform and Harvard mouth, -

to extend me
some fucking courtesy.

You got to ask me nicely.

ColoneI Jessep, I'd Iike
a copy of the transfer order. Sir.

No probIem.

Who is it?
It's me.

I've realIy missed you.
It's been three hours ...

Markinson's disappeared.
He's gone U.A. Unauthorized Absence.

When?
This afternoon, after we Ieft.

I'Il find him in the morning.
l've aIready tried.

You're cIose to '"interfering
with a government investigation.''

I'm Louden Downey's attorney now.
Aunt Ginny feels Iike she knows me.

So I suggested that I get more
directIy invoIved with the case.

She had Louden sign the papers
an hour ago.

You're not making this up
just to bother me?

You're stiII Iead counseI.
SpIendid.

I think Kendrick ordered the
Code Red, and so do you.

Ten-hut!

Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
Not: ''Did you cIean the latrine?''

Did Lt. Kendrick order you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

Yes, sir.

Did he?
Yes, sir.

Why didn't you say so before?
You didn't ask us, sir.

I get paid, no matter how Iong
you spend in jaiI.

I know you do, sir.
Fuck you, HaroId!

At ease. Let's sort this thing out.

There was a pIatoon meeting
on September 6th.

Lt. Kendrick says he toId you
nothing was to happen to Santiago.

ls this true?
I want you to speak freely.

That's correct.
But then he dismissed the platoon.

What happened then?
Lt. Kendrick came to our room.

About five minutes after the
meeting broke. About 16.20.

And then?

Lt. Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

Jack!
They were given an order.

Jack ...
I'II be right back.

Did you know about the order?
Jo GaIIoway: Downey's Iawyer.

What are you accusing me of?
Did you?

He didn't know,
or he wouId have had to tell us.

Now our clients might pIead not
guilty and say they were ordered.

Kendrick told them
not to touch Santiago.

And then he toId Dawson and Downey
to give him a Code Red.

23 marines and a highly decorated
Iieutenant disagree.

Why did Markinson go U.A?
You'II never know.

You know what Markinson did
for 1 7 years? CounterinteIligence.

Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

Look Danny,
Jessep's star is on the rise.

Division want to spare him
and the Corps any embarrassment.

I'II knock it down to invoIuntary
manslaughter. Two years.

No, we're going to court.

You'II Iose. And if we go to court,
I'II have to go alI the way:

Murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

Danny's got me by the baIIs here,
but not in the courtroom.

He doesn't want to see them get Iife
if they couId be home in six months.

That's the end of this negotiation.
See you at the arraignment.

Here's the story: they're offering
invoiuntary manslaughter. Two years.

You'II be home in six months.

Wow! You're the greatest Iawyer in
the world! How can we thank you?

Did you hear what I just said?
You'II be home in six months.

I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

We can't make a deaI.

We did nothing but our job.
I'Il accept the consequences.

But l won't say l'm guiIty, sir.

Did she put you up to this?
We have a code, sir.

You and your code pIead not guiIty.
You'II be in jaiI for Iife.

Do what I say,
and you'II be home in six months.

Do it, HaroId.
Six months, it's nothing!

Permission to ...
Speak! Jesus!

What do we do then? After six months
we'lI be dishonourabIy discharged.

ProbabIy.
What do we do then, sir?

We joined the Marines because
we wanted to Iive by a certain code.

You're asking us to say we have no
honour, that we're not marines!

If what we did was wrong,
I'II accept my punishment.

But l believe I did my job. I wilI
not dishonour myself, my unit -

or the Corps,
so that I can go home in six months.

Sir!

I'd Iike to taIk to Corporal Dawson
alone for a minute.

Sergeant!

We'd like to go to another room.
Sit down.

You don't Iike me very much,
do you?

Forget it, it doesn't matter.

You know ...
Downey worships you.

He'lI do whatever you do.

Are you going to let this
happen to him because of a code?

Do you think we were right?
Do you?

I think you'd Iose.

You're such a coward.
I can't beIieve you're in uniform.

I won't be responsibIe for this.

If you go to Leavenworth for Iife,
I don't give a shit!

What about saIuting
an officer when he Ieaves the room?

I don't beIieve it!
He"s going to jaiI to spite me!

If he wants to jump off a cIiff,
that's his business.

How do l get him a new lawyer?
At the arraignment.

Just teII the judge
you want new counseI assigned.

One thing, though.
Be sure and ask niceIy.

What do you want from me?
I want you to make an argument.

That didn't help Calley at My Lai,
or the Nazis at Nuremburg.

Do you think that's the same -

as two teenagers executing an
order they didn't think wouId harm?

Don't Iook now,
but you're making an argument.

I'lI get them a new attorney.

What are you afraid of?
You father's expectations?

Spare me the psychobabble!
They'II just have another lawyer.

They need you.
You know how to win.

If you waIk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

Their fate was seaIed
when Santiago died.

Do they have a case?
You and Dawson are dreamers.

lt's not what I beIieve,
but what I can prove.

So, don't telI me what l know
or don't know. l know the Iaw!

You're just a used-car saIesman.

An ambulance-chaser with a rank.
You're nothing. Live with that.

So I toId Duncan, ''If you want me
to take this to court, -

you'II get a year's paperwork -

because a 90-year-old
misread the Insurance Code.'"

Fifteen minutes later,
he makes a deaI.

AII rise.

Where are we?
Docket nr. 41 1275 VR/5.

The United States versus Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey.

The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

Does the defence
wish to enter a pIea?

They're not guiIty.
Enter a pIea of ''not guiIty'".

Adjourned untiI 10.00, three weeks
from today, when we wiII reconvene.

Why would a Iieutenant with so
IittIe experience get a murder case?

Would it be, so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

We'Il work at my apartment.
Jo, bring Iegal pads and pens.

Sam, start a medical profile.

Jo, get Dawson's, Downey's
and Santiago's conduct reports.

I've only got Yoo-hoo and Cocoa
Puffs, so bring your own food.

So this is
what a courtroom Iooks like!

Did you speak
to your friend at the NIS?

She said, if Markinson doesn't
want to be found, he won't be.

I could be Markinson,
and you wouIdn't know.

Are you Markinson?
No.

/'m not Markinson.
That's two down.

What?

Now that JoAnne's on this ...
Do you stiII need me?

They were ordered, Sam.
They didn't know it was ilIegaI.

Any decent person wouId have ...
They can't question orders.

What's the secret?
I give orders nobody obeys!

We have softbaII and marching bands.
They risk getting shot at.

I need you.
You're better at research than I am.

And you know
how to prepare a wItness.

I've got medicaI reports
and Chinese food. Let's eat first.

What?

Got any kung pau chicken?

They can't prove there was poison.
Code Reds are normal at Guantanamo.

And there was an order. Kendrick
gave it, they had no choice.

What about their motive?
That doesn't make them guiIty.

We'II deal with that Iater.

We must show that Santiago couId
have died from something eIse.

Jo, find out aII about
Iactic acidosis.

This is Lt. GaIIoway, I'm trying
to find a Lt. CoI Markinson ...

Doctor, was there any sign
of injury? Scrapes? Cuts?

Bruises? Broken bones?
Any sign of violence?

Other than the dead body?
l aIways waIk into that.

He ordered me and Dawson
to give WiIIy a Code Red.

The answers must come faster.
It's Iike he's searching for it.

And caII him Private Santiago.
Wi//y is someone with a mother.

The jury has seven men and two
women. AlI experienced officers.

The women have no chiIdren.
Too bad.

A jury trial
is about assigning blame.

Santiago's dead. They want to know
who's to bIame. We say, Kendrick.

This won't be won by the Iaw,
but by the Iawyers. So, poker faces.

If something goes wrong,
don't hang your head or scribbIe.

Look Iike you expected it.

Pass me documents ...
''SwiftIy, and don't Iook anxious.''

That perfume
wrecks my concentration.

l was taIking to Sam.

What time is it?
Time to go home and sIeep.

Give me a ride?
Sure.

You're a good man, CharIie Brown.
See you in court, counseIIor.

I know. We've had our differences.

We both said things we didn't mean.

If you've gained some respect
for me, I'm happy about that.

But it's no big deaI.
You needn't say you Iike me.

I was just going to tell you
to wear matching socks.

Okay. Good tip.

We're ready.
You'd better beIieve it.

We're gonna get creamed.

You are gonna save our son?
I'lI do my best.

Danny,
meet Ginny MiIIer, Louden's aunt.

You're Aunt Ginny?

I was expecting someone oIder.
So was I.

Last chance. I'II fIip you for it.
Too Iate.

AIl having business with this
court martiaI, stand forward.

ColoneI JuIius RandoIph presiding.

Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

On September 6th, the accused
entered P.F.C. Santiago's room.

They woke him, tied him,
and forced a rag into his throat.

A reaction caIIed Iactic acidosis
caused his Iungs to bleed.

He drowned in his own blood,
and was dead at 00.37 a.m.

These are
the undisputed facts of the case.

What I"ve just toId you
is exactly what you will hear -

from CorporaI Dawson
and Private Downey.

We wilI aIso show that
they soaked the rag in poison, -

and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kiII.

Lt. Kaffee is going to try
and work a IittIe magic here.

He'II try a littIe misdirection.
Astonishing stories of rituaIs.

DazzIe you with officiaI-sounding
terms Iike ''Code Red''.

He may even try to cut
into a few officers.

He has no evidence,
but it'Il be entertaining.

But in the end, aII this magic
wilI not obscure the fact -

that WiIIy Santiago is dead,
and Dawson and Downey kiIled him.

These are the undisputed facts.
Lt. Kaffee.

It is futile to try and prove that
there was poison or intent to kilI.

Dawson and Downey didn't go to
Santiago seeking vengeance.

And they weren't looking for kicks.
They were ordered to do it.

l'II say that again:
They were ordered to do it.

In the real worId, or here in
Washington, that doesn't mean much.

But if you're a marine
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, -

you folIow orders,
or you pack your bags.

Dawson and Downey are sitting here
because they did their job.

CaII the first witness.
We caIl Mr. R.C. McGuire.

Raise your right hand, pIease.

Will you teII the truth, the whoIe
truth, and nothing but the truth?

Yes.

State your name and occupation.

Robert C. McGuire,
SpeciaI Agent, NIS.

Did you receive a Ietter from PFC
Santiago on the 3rd of September?

Yes. It said that a member of the
unit had shot across the fenceIine.

Was he named?

No. I toId CoIoneI Jessep that l
would be coming down to investigate.

OnIy one sentry
had a buIIet missing.

Who was that?
CorporaI Harold Dawson.

What did Dawson say about this?
That he was engaged by the enemy.

But you don't believe him?
I'ts not ...

Why was Dawson never charged?

There wasn't enough evidence.
Thank you.

Why was there not enough evidence?
You had the letter.

Santiago was the onIy eyewitness.
I had no chance to interview him.

And now we'II never know, right?
No.

No more questions.
The witness is excused.

CorporaI CarI Hammaker,
RSC Windward, 2nd PIatoon Bravo.

Were you present at a meeting held
by Lt. Kendrick on September 6th?

Yes, sir.
What was said there?

Lt. Kendrick told us
we had an informer.

That Santiago had reported to the
NIS on a member of our platoon.

Did that make you mad? TruthfuIIy?
Yes, sir.

How mad?
Santiago betrayed our code.

Were other men aIso angry?
Dawson and Downey?

Objection! The witness is asked
how my cIients fe/t on Sept. 6th.

Sustained.

Did Lieutenant Kendrick give you
a standing order at that meeting?

He said, not to take
matters into our own hands.

What was the order?
Santiago wasn't to be touched.

Your witness.

Were you in Dawson and Downey's
room five minutes Iater?

Thanks. No more questions.
The witness is excused.

CorporaI Raymond Thomas.

Captain Ross is pIanning to caIl
the entire pIatoon.

The platoon Ieader's instructions
are reIevant testimony.

The defence concedes that aII 22
wiII confirm Hammaker's account.

But none of them were in
Dawson and Downey's room at 16.20.

Captain?
The government wiII concede that.

Then we wilI adjourn. You can
caII your next witness tomorrow.

Let's go over the doctor again.
It's the wrong approach.

At 3.00 a.m., he didn't know
what kilIed Santiago.

But after he met Jessep, he said
it was poison. He's Iying.

Great! We can say,
''Liar, Iiar, pants on fire.''

We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have.

Private Santiago was hospitaIized
at 00.12 , -

and was pronounced dead at 00.37.

Doctor, what is Iactic acidosis?

It arises if the muscIes and celIs
burn sugar instead of oxygen.

It caused Santiago's Iungs to bIeed.

How Iong does it take, before
the muscIes start burning sugar?

20 to 30 minutes.
What made it faster with Santiago?

Some kind of poison.
The witness is specuIating!

He is an expert medicaI witness.
It is not specuIation.

He is not a criminologist.
The medicaI facts are inconcIusive.

But I'm sure you don't mind
if we admit his opinion now.

Not at aII, sir.

Was WiIIy Santiago poisoned?
AbsoIuteIy.

But you know that the coroner's
report shows no trace of poison?

There are dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectabIe.

The nature of the acidosis
is the compeIIing factor here.

CouId a person have a condition
that could speed up acidosis?

Is it possibIe?
It's possibIe.

What might
some of those conditions be?

A coronary disorder
wouId make it more rapid.

lf I had a coronary condition and
someone stuffed a rag in my mouth, -

would I stilI burn sugar
after the rag was taken out?

lf it was very serious.

CouId such a condition have
such mild initiaI symptoms, -

that a routine examination
might not reveaI them?

There would stiIl be symptoms.
What kind?

Chest pains?
Shortness of breath? Fatigue?

Of course.

Is this your signature?
Yes, it is.

This is an order for Santiago
to be put on restricted duty.

WouId you read your remarks?

''Patient compIains of chest pains,
shortness of breath, and fatigue.''

''Restricted from running distances
over five miIes.'"

Couldn't it have been a
heart condition, not a poison, -

that caused the
rapid chemicaI reaction?

No.
It's not possibIe?

No. I examined Santiago thoroughIy
and gave him a cIean biII of heaIth.

So it had to be poison. If you
give a man a cIean biII of heaIth, -

and he Iater dies,
you'd be in trouble, right?

Object! Move to strike!
Sustained.

I've no more questions, your honour.

You've been a doctor for 1 7 years.
You are Chief of InternaI Medicine -

at a hospitaI
which has served 5,426 peopIe.

In your professionaI opinion,
was Santiago poisoned?

We ask that the doctor's testimony
be stricken from the record.

-The court shouId disregard it.
-The objection's overruIed.

We strenuously object,
and ask to confer with you -

before you ruIe on this objection.

The objection has been overruIed.
Move to reconsider.

The witness is an expert,
and the court wiIl hear his opinion!

ln your expert professionaI opinion,
was WiIIy Santiago poisoned?

Yes.
Thank you, sir. No more questions.

You may step down.

WhiIe we reserve the right to caII
further witnesses, government rests.

We'II recess untiI Monday, when the
defence wiII calI its first witness.

''I strenuously object."'
ls that how it works?

''OverruIed!''
''No, I strenuous/y object!'"

Oh, then I'II reconsider!
I got it on the record.

You object once , so we can say
he's not a criminologist.

If you keep after it, it looks Iike
a bunch of fancy Iawyer tricks.

The judge caIIed him an expert!
Sam, she made a mistake.

I'Il go calI my wife.
I'II see you tonight.

Why do you hate them?
They beat up a weakIing.

The rest is just coffee-house crap.
They tortured a weaker kid!

They kilIed him,
because he couIdn't run very fast!

Everybody take the night off.
I'm sorry ...

We've been working 20 hours a day.
Go see your wife and daughter.

Jo, go and do ... whatever you do
when you're not here.

It's Saturday tomorrow?
We start at ten.

Why do you like them so much?

'Cause they stand on a waII and say:
"'Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight."'

Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

Sorry to bother you.
I should have calIed first.

No, I'm just watching the ball game.
Come on in.

How wouId you feeI
if l took you to dinner tonight?

Is this a date?

It sounded Iike you were
asking me out on a date.

Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

My third case was a ''drunk
and disorderIy''. lt took nine weeks.

Nine weeks? And the plea bargain?
15 days.

You sure hustIed them.
I got shifted to lnternaI Affairs.

But I have two medaIs
and two Ietters of commendation.

Why are you aIways
giving me your résumé?

I want you to think I'm good.
l do.

No, you don't.

You're an exceptionaI lawyer.
The court members respond to you.

You"lI convince them. Dawson and
Downey wilI owe you their Iives.

Jo ...

You've got to prepare for Iosing.
Ross's statement was aII true.

Even if it mattered to the court,
I can't prove they were ordered.

AlI we have is the testimony of
two people accused of murder.

We'Il find Markinson.
We're gonna Iose, huge.

Corporal Barnes, Windward Barracks,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

For what reasons might a marine
receive a Code Red?

Being Iate, being disorderly,
falIing back on a run ...

Have you ever received a Code Red?
Yes. I dropped my weapon.

It was over 100 degrees. My paIms
were sweaty and I hadn't used resin.

What happened?
They threw a bIanket over me.

They punched me on the arms
and poured glue on my hands.

And it worked.
I've never dropped my weapon since.

Was Private Santiago ever late?
Was his barracks ever disorderIy?

Did he faII back on runs?

Did he ever receive a Code Red
before September 6th?

No, never.

You got a Code Red just for
sweating. Why not Santiago?

Dawson wouldn't aIIow it, sir.
Dawson wouIdn't allow it.

The guys taIked tough,
but they were too afraid of Dawson.

Objection. SpecuIation.
Did you want to punish Santiago?

Why didn't you?
Dawson wouId have kicked my butt.

Captain Ross wiII ask you
some questions.

CorporaI Barnes, this is the Marine
Recruit OutIine. Do you know it?

Have you read it? Good.
Look up ''Code Reds'', pIease.

Sir?
Just find the page with Code Reds.

'"Code Red"' is just a term we use
down at GlTMO. l don't know ...

Oh. We're in Iuck, then!

''Standard Operating Procedure.
RSC, Guantamo Bay, Cuba.''

Can we find ''Code Red'' in there?
No, sir.

I'm a marine. Is there no book,
no set of orders or reguIations -

teIIing me that one of my
duties is to perform Code Reds?

No book, sir.

No further questions.

WouId you find the page that says
where the mess halI is?

That's not in the book, sir.

You mean you've never had a meal?
Three square meaIs a day, sir.

How did you find the mess haII,
if it's not in this book?

I guess I just foIIowed the crowd.
No more questions.

CorporaI Barnes, you may step down.

We do our finaI Kendrick review
tonight. I want to sIam-dunk him.

Hey, Luther.
Admiral! How's the big case?

Nose to the grindstone.
No fIies on you.

WeII, it ain't over
'tiII the fat Iady sings.

You can say that again.
Not 'tiII the fat Iady sings.

I waIked into that one.

Jesus Christ!
You Ieft the door unlocked.

You scared the shit out of me.
You're under subpoena.

And the Iives of two marines are in
your hands. I have to heIp you.

What do you know?
Was it a Code Red?

Did Kendrick give the order?
Did you witness it? Did you?

No.
Then you don't know shit.

He was never gonna be transferred.

Jessep wanted him ''trained"'.
But you signed the transfer order.

I signed them when you got to Cuba,
five days after Santiago's death.

I'lI get you immunity. In four days
you can teII this to the court.

I'II check you into a motel.
We'II start from the beginning.

I don't want a deal, or immunity.

l'm not proud of what I have done,
nor of what I am doing.

Where is he?
The Downtown Lodge.

My clearance code is 41 15273.
I don't have a cIearance code.

He aIso says Jessep's lying about
the first flight being at 6.00 a.m.

Markinson says there was one seven
hours earlier. Did you hear that?

lsn't there a record of fIights?
You need the Tower Chief's log.

We're gonna win.
Jo, we don't know anything yet.

You take care of Downey,
I'II taIk to Ross.

Hi, Danny. Nice work today.
The redirect on Barnes!

I have Markinson.
Where is he?

ln a moteI room in Northeast,
under guard.

The transfer order is phoney. And
Jessep Iied about the first fIight.

I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

If you accuse Kendrick or Jessep
without evidence, -

you'Il be court-martiaIIed,
and that wiII go on your record.

Markinson won't hoId up, he's crazy.
l'm just telIing you to help you.

And I think you're aII insane,
and your code of honour is shit!

Don't Iump me in
with Kendrick and Jessep.

Your cIients don't belong in jaiI,
but it's not my decision.

I represent the government without
prejudice, and my cIient has a case.

Please acknowIedge that
I've informed you -

of the consequences of accusing
an officer without evidence.

I've been so advised.

You got bulIied into that courtroom.
By everyone. By Dawson. By GaIIoway.

Shit, l practicaIIy dared you.

And you were bullied
by the memory of a dead Iawyer.

You're a Iousy fucking
softbaII pIayer, Jack!

Your boys are going down, Danny.
l can't stop it any more.

Was Santiago a good marine?
l'd say he was average.

Your proficiency and conduct reports
aII indicate he was beIow average.

He was beIow average, but l don't
want to trampIe on his grave.

l know, but you're under oath.
I'm aware of my oath.

Here are your Iast three
reports for CorporaI Dawson.

He rated exceptional twice,
but on June 9th he's beIow average.

l'd Iike to discuss that.
Fine.

Dawson scored perfect at
Infantry School.

But unIike most of his cIass,
he hasn't been promoted.

Was this report the reason?
I'm sure it was.

Do you know why he got this grade?
No.

I have many men.
I write many reports.

Do you recaII
an incident with PFC Curtis BeII?

He stoIe from the Officers' CIub.
Yes.

Did you report him
to the proper authorities?

I have two books by my bed:
the Marine Code and the BibIe.

The only proper authorities I know
are Col. Jessep and God.

Then you don't recognise this court
as a proper authority?

Objection. Argumentative.
Sustained. Watch yourseIf!

Did you report BeII?
I thought very highIy of him.

l didn't want to charge him.
You wanted it handIed in the unit?

Yes, l most certainIy did.
Do you know what a Code Red is?

Have you ever ordered one?
No.

Did you order that Private BelI
get nothing but water for a week?

You're distorting the truth.
He was on barracks restriction.

He had water and vitamins.
His heaIth was never in danger.

l'm sure it was IoveIy for him.
But it was on your orders.

You denied him food?
Yes, I did.

WouId this be caIled a Code Red?
No.

WouId the other 478 marines
consider it a Code Red?

The witness can't know what
478 other men would say.

These questions are argumentative,
and irreIevant badgering.

Sustained. I wouId remind you -

that the witness has
an impeccabIe service record.

Was Dawson rated beIow average
for sneaking food to Private BeII?

Object!
Not so fast. Lieutenant?

Dawson was given a below average
rating for committing a crime.

What crime did he commit?

Lt. Kendrick, Dawson brought
a hungry guy some food.

What crime did he commit?
Disobeying an order.

So, because he made a decision about
the weIfare of a marine -

that confIicted with your order,
he was punished.

Dawson disobeyed an order!

It wasn't a reaI order, was it?
lt's peacetime!

He wasn't asked
to advance on a beachhead.

SureIy a marine of his inteIIigence
couId distinguish important orders -

from those that might be
moralIy questionabIe?

Can Dawson determine on his own,
which orders to folIow?

No, he cannot.
He Iearned that?

I wouId think so.
You know so, don't you?

FinaIIy : If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red ...

I toId them not to touch him!
WouId he dare disobey?

Don't answer that!
I'm through.

Did you order Dawson and Downey
to give WiIIy Santiago a Code Red?

Lieutenant Kendrick ...
No, I did not.

What's the word?

l have the Tower Chief's Iog.
Jessep's teIIing the truth.

Working late tonight, Lieutenant?
Oh, yeah ...

There was no fIight at 1 1 o'clock!

The first flight Ieft at 23.00, and
arrived at Andrews at 2.00 a.m.

Then why isn't it in the Iog?

Jessep.
He fixed the Iogbook?

I can prove that a pIane Ianded.
l'lI get the Iog from Andrews.

You won't find anything.
He can make a fIight disappear?

Jessep is about to join the NSC.
He knows how to sidestep landmines.

He can't sidestep you.
You stiII want me to witness?

Thursday morning. Ten o'cIock.

Someone must know about the fIight.

Do you know how many pIanes
take off and land every day?

No one wiIl remember it.
Forget the fIight.

Markinson wiII testify that
the transfer was forged.

That and Downey's testimony
wiII be enough.

Why did you go
into Santiago's room that night?

To give him a Code Red.
Why did you do that?

I was ordered to by
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

You're gonna do fine.

Can we rejoin the platoon soon?
AbsoIuteIy.

Remember the order of the
questions. And use smaII words.

Just go slow.
And get him off as fast as you can.

What? It's gonna be fine.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago,
/ was Wi//iam's executive officer.

/ knew your son on/y by name.

Soon, the tria/ of the two men
who ki//ed him wi// be over, -

and thejury wi// try to offer you
an exp/anation for his death.

/'ve done what / can
to bring the truth to /ight.

But your son is dead because
/ wasn"t strong enough to stop it.

Lieutenant Co/one/ Markinson,
United States Marine Corps.

PIease teII us one Iast time:

Why did you go to Santiago's room
on the night of September 6th?

A Code Red was ordered
by PIatoon Commander Kendrick.

Thank you. Your witness.

According to the log,
you were at post 39 until 16.00.

They keep that Iog pretty good.
How far is post 39 from barracks?

It's a ways, sir. lt's a hike.
About how far by jeep?

Ever had to waIk it?
Yes sir, that day.

The pick-up private ...
we calI him that ...

... aIso 'cause he can get the girIs.

He got a fIat tyre at post 39, so
we had to jog back to barracks.

If it's 10-15 minutes by jeep,
it must be an hour on foot, right?

We did it in 45 minutes, sir.
Not bad.

You've said your assault on Santiago
was ordered by Lt. Kendrick -

in your room at 16.20, right?

Yes, sir.
But you weren't back before 16.45.

So how couId you be
in your room at 16.20?

WeII, sir, there was a blowout ...

Did you actuaIIy hear
Lt. Kendriok order a Code Red?

HaI said ...
Did you actuaIIy hear the order?

No, sir.
I'd Iike to request a recess.

The witness has rights!
He has been read his rights.

Why did you go to Santiago's room?
Did Dawson teII you to?

Don't look at him!
Answer the captain's question.

Yes. I was given an order by
CorporaI Dawson, and I foIIowed it.

Where do you think he is?

As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

Danny, I'm sorry ...
Don't worry about it.

AII we need to do is caII someone
to taIk about impIied orders, -

or caII Downey back first.

Or how about getting Dawson charged
with the Kennedy assassination?

Are you drunk?
Pretty much. Yeah.

I'II put on a pot of coffee.

She's gonna make coffee?
That's nice.

Downey wasn't in his room.
He wasn't even there.

That was important information,
don't you think?

Danny, it was a setback.
And I'm sorry.

We fix it, and move on to Markinson.

Markinson's dead.

You reaIIy got to hand it
to those marshaIs.

He didn't hang himseIf by his Iaces,
or slash himseIf with a butterknife.

He got into fuII dress uniform,
drew a nickIe-pIated pistoi, -

and fired a buIIet into his mouth.

Since we're out of witnesses,
I thought I'd drink a Iittle.

l stiII think we can win.
Maybe you shouId drink a Iittle.

In the morning,
we'II ask for 24 hours deIay.

Why?
To subpoena CoIoneI Jessep.

No, Jo! Your passion is compeIIing,
but useIess.

Louden Downey
needed a tria/ lawyer today.

You chicken shit!
You just want an excuse to give up.

It's over!

Why did you ask Jessep
for the transfer order?

I wanted it!
You couId have got it anywhere.

You just wanted
to see Jessep's reaction.

Your instinct was right.
Now Iet's caII Jessep, and end this.

What possible good wouId that do?
He ordered the Code Red.

He did? That's great!
And of course, you have proof?

You missed that day at Law School?
Get it from him.

We get it from him!
Yes, no probIem.

CoIoneI, didn't you
order a Code Red on Santiago?

Sorry, time's up!
What do the losers get?

For the defendants,
Iife at Fort Leavenworth!

And for defence counseI Kaffee:
That's right! A court martiaI!

After accusing a decorated officer
of conspiracy and perjury, -

Kaffee can expect a career -

teaching typewriter
maintenance at a women's schooI!

Thank you for playing ''FoIlow the
Advice of the GaIacticaIIy Stupid.''

I'm sorry I Iost you
your steak knives.

Stop cIeaning up.

Sam, stop cIeaning up.

You want a drink?
Yeah.

Is your father proud of you?
I'II bet he is.

I'Il bet he bores the shit out of
neighbours and reIatives:

"'Sam's got a big case.
He's making an argument.''

My father would have enjoyed
seeing me graduate from Law SchooI.

He wouId have Iiked that a lot.

I wrote a paper about your father
in coIIege.

One of the best triaI lawyers.
Yes, he was.

But if I were Dawson and Downey,
and had to choose you or him, -

I'd choose you any day.

You shouId have seen yourseIf
thunder away at Kendrick.

WouId you put Jessep on the stand?
No.

Do you think my father would?
With the evidence we have? Never.

But we can't get around this :

Neither LioneI Kaffee nor
Sam Weinberg are Iead counseI here.

So there's reaIIy onIy one question:
What wouId you do?

Jo, get in the car.
JoAnne, pIease get in the car!

JoAnne! I apoIogise. I was angry.
l'm sorry about what l said.

I'm going to put Jessep
on the stand!

What do you suggest?
Use the phoney transfer order.

Our witness to that is dead.
A probIem, to a Iesser attorney!

Last night he was swimming in
Jack Daniels, today he's Superman!

I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

Jessep toId Kendrick
to order a Code Red.

For us to win,
Jessep has to say he gave the order.

And you can get him to say that?
I think he wants to say it!

He made a decision, and that's it!

He eats breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kiII him.

No one teIIs him how to
run his unit. Least of aII me.

I'lI lead him
right where he's dying to go.

That's the pIan?
How are you going to do it?

I've no idea. Where's my bat?
I think better with it.

I put it in the cIoset.
I was tripping on it.

Never put that bat in the cIoset!

I'm going to the office.
He does think better with the bat!

He//o?
Sam, l need you to do something.

What's going on?
l'm going out to Andrews.

Did Sam get the guys?
Yes.

Can I talk to you for a second?

How are you feeIing?

l think Jessep
wiIl have his hands fuII.

Listen Danny,
when you're out there today, -

if you feeI Iike
he's not going to say it, -

don't go for it.
You couId get into troubIe.

I'm with InternaI Affairs. I know.

You're not suggesting that l
back off a materiai witness?

If you can't get him ... yeah.

AII rise!

Where's Sam?
On his way.

Where is he?
Don't worry.

Lieutenant! CalI your witness.

Defence calIs Colonel Nathan Jessep.

Raise your right hand, please.

WiII you teIl the truth, the whoIe
truth, and nothing but the truth?

Yes.
Have a seat pIease, sir.

State your name,
rank and current biIlet.

Colonel Jessep, Commanding Officer,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

He's not here.

When you Iearned
of Santiago's Ietter, -

you had a meeting
with your senior officers, correct?

PIatoon Commander Kendrick,
and Lt. CoIoneI Markinson.

And Markinson is now dead,
is that right?

What is the counseIlor impIying?
Just that Markinson is not aIive.

The coIoneI
doesn't need to confirm that.

He may not be aware that Markinson
took his own Iife two days ago.

The witness, the court
and now the jury are aware.

We thank you.
Move on, Lieutenant.

You gave Kendrick an order, right?

I toId him to teII his men
not to touch Santiago.

Did you give Markinson an order?

l ordered him to have Santiago
transferred immediately.

Why?
His Iife might be in danger.

Grave danger?
Is there another kind?

This is the order
that you and Markinson signed -

for Santiago to fIy out
at six the next morning.

Was that the first fIight?
Yes, it was.

You fIew here today, didn"t you?

You're wearing your dress uniform.
As are you.

Did you wear it on the pIane?
ls this reIevant?

I'm asking the court
for a IittIe Iatitude.

A very IittIe Iatitude.

I wore utilities on the pIane.
You brought the uniform?

Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
Is his underwear a state secret?

You'd better get somewhere fast
with this, Lieutenant!

I brought a change of cIothes
and some personaI items.

After Dawson and Downey's arrest,
Santiago's room was inventoried.

Four pairs of camoufIage pants,
three khaki shirts, boots.

Four pairs of socks ...
Is there any question coming?

Lieutenant, state your question.
Why hadn't Santiago packed?

We'Il get back to that. This is a
record of phone calls from the base.

You've recently made three caIls.
Do you recognise the numbers?

l caIled CoIoneI Fitzhughes
to teII him I'd be in town.

The second was to arrange a
meeting with Congressman Richman.

And the third was to my sister.
Why did you caII her?

I invited her to dinner tonight.

These are the records
for September 6th.

And these are the 14 Ietters
Santiago wrote in nine months, -

begging for a transfer.

But when he finaIIy got it, -

how many peopIe did he caII?
Zero! Nobody.

Not one caII to his parents or
a friend, saying he was coming.

He was asIeep at midnight, and you
say he had a fIight in six hours.

Yet everything he owned was
in his cIoset or his footIocker.

For one day, you packed
and made three caIIs.

Santiago was Ieaving
for the rest of his life.

And he hadn't called a soul,
or packed a thing.

Can you expIain that?

There was no transfer order,
was there?

Objection! Lt. Kaffee is trying to
smear a high-ranking officer -

hoping to suggest impropriety
and win points.

I recommend that he be reprimanded,
and the witness be excused.

Overruled. The objection is noted.
ColoneI?

Is this funny, sir?
No, it's tragic.

Do you have an answer?
AbsoIuteIy. I don"t have a cIue.

Maybe he was an earIy riser.
Maybe he didn't have any friends.

I'm an educated man, but I don't
know the traveI habits of Santiago.

What l do know is that he was
set to Ieave at 0600.

Are these reaIly the questions
I was caIIed here to answer?

I hope you have something more.

These two marines
are on trial for their Iives.

Please teIl me their Iawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone biII.

Do you have any other
questions for me, counseIIor?

Lieutenant Kaffee?

Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

Thanks, Danny. I Iove Washington.
I didn't dismiss you.

I beg your pardon?
I'm not through. Sit down.

''CoIoneI.''

He shouId address me as
''CoIonel'' or ''sir'".

CaII him ''CoIoneI'' or ''sir''.
What kind of unit is this?

And the witness will address me
as ''judge'' or ''Your Honour''.

Take your seat ... CoIonel.

What shaIl we discuss?
My favourite colour?

CoIoneI, the 6.00 a.m. fIight
was the first one?

There wasn't one seven hours earIier
to Andrews?

Haven't we covered this?

These are the fIight Iogs for
Guantanamo Bay and Andrews.

There's no flight at 1 1 .00 p.m.,
and no arrivaI at 2.00 a.m.

l'd Iike to admit them as evidence.

But the fIight never existed!
We beIieve it did, sir.

We caIl Airmen O'MaIIey and
Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.

They're not on the Iist.
They are rebuttaI witnesses.

I'II alIow the witnesses.
This is ridicuIous!

Check the Iogs, for Christ's sake!
We'Il get to that in a minute.

You said, you told Kendrick to say
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

He was cIear on what you wanted?
CrystaI.

Can he have ignored the order?
lgnored the order?

Or forgot it?
No.

CouId he have thought,
''The oId man is wrong''?

When Lt. Kendrick talked to the men,
any chance they ignored him?

Ever been in the infantry, son?

Ever served in a forward area?

Ever put your Iife in another
man's hands, and his in yours?

We folIow orders, son.
Otherwise peopIe die.

lt's that simpIe. Are we cIear?

Are we cIear?
CrystaI.

One last question, before I caIl
Airmen O'MaIIey and Rodriguez.

If you ordered that Santiago wasn't
to be touched, -

and your orders
are aIways foIIowed, -

then why was Santiago in danger?

Why wouId it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

He was a sub-standard marine.
He was being transferred ...

You said he was transferred
because he was in danger.

I said, ''grave danger?'' and you
said ... we can read it ...

I know what I said!
Then why the two orders?

Men can do things on their own.
But your men never did.

Your men obey orders.
So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?

You snotty littIe bastard.

I request a recess.
We'II wait for an answer.

If Lt. Kendrick gave an order that
Santiago wasn't to be touched, -

why did he have to be transferred?

Kendrick ordered a Code Red,
because you toId him to!

And when it went bad, you signed a
phoney transfer and fixed the logs!

You coerced the doctor! CoIonel
Jessep, did you order the Code Red?

You don't have to answer that.
You want answers?

l want the truth!

You can't handIe the truth!

Son, we Iive in a worId with
waIIs that must be guarded.

Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lt. Weinberg?

i have more responsibiIity
than you can fathom.

You weep for Santiago
and curse the Marines.

You don't know what I know.
Santiago's tragic death saved Iives.

And my existence,
whiIe grotesque to you, saves Iives!

But deep down, in pIaces
you don't taIk about at parties, -

you need me on that walI.

We use words Iike
honour, code, Ioyalty.

They're the backbone of our Iives.
You use them as a punchIine!

I haven't the time or incIination
to expIain myseIf -

to a man who needs my protection -

but questions the way I do it.
Better just to thank me.

Or pick up a gun and stand a post.

But I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitIed to!

Did you order the Code Red?
You're goddamn right I did!

I suggest the jury be dismissed, and
we move to an article 39a session.

The witness has rights.
Captain Ross?

Jack?

The members of the court
wiII retire.

What the heII is this?
l did my job, I'd do it again.

I'm going back to my base.
You're not going anywhere.

MP's, guard the coIoneI!

Captain Ross.
You've the right to remain siIent.

I'm being charged with a crime?

l'm being charged with a crime?

This is funny, that's what this is!

I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your
head and piss in your skuII!

CoIoneI Jessep,
do you understand your rights?

You fucking people have no
idea how to defend a nation.

AII you did was weaken a country,
Kaffee!

You put peopIes' Iives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

Don't caII me son.
I'm a Iawyer, and a navaI officer.

And you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch!

The witness is excused.

AlI rise!

Have you reached a verdict?
We have, sir.

Corporal Dawson
and Private Downey.

Of the charge of murder,
the members find the accused -

not guiIty.

On the charge of
conspiracy to commit murder, -

the members
find the accused not guiIty.

On the charge of
conduct unbecoming a US Marine, -

the members
find the accused guilty as charged.

You are sentenced to
time aIready served, -

and to be dishonourabIy
discharged from the Marines.

This court-martiaI is adjourned.

What did that mean?

Hal?

What did that mean?

CoIoneI Jessep said
he ordered the Code Red.

What did we do wrong?
It's not that simpIe.

We did nothing wrong!
Yeah, we did.

We're supposed to fight for peopIe
who can't fight for themseIves.

We were supposed to fight for WilIy.

Lt. Kaffee, I have to
take these men for some paperwork.

HaroId?

Sir?

You don't need a patch on your arm
to have honour.

Ten-hut! There's an officer on deck.

O'MaIley and Rodriguez,
what exactIy couId they testify to?

Probably that they had absoIuteIy
no recoIIection of anything.

Strong witnesses.
And handsome too.

I've got to go arrest Kendrick.
TelI him I said ''Hi''.

WiII do.
