Over here in this city murder
cases, happen every day.

But case number 29878/

848977.

As I was sleeping in the off duty
this case came searching for me.

On the neck there were marks of
pulling and breaking the chain.

As per prima facie evidence.

Yet another murder while mugging.

But at night where there are
only druggies and prostitutes...

...in this neighborhood of city.

This is the house where I grew up.

My Mama.

A very old birth day
which is in memory.

In an orphanage run by Father
Geevarghese at Kottayam.

My 7th birth day.

In the file at Orphanage an arbitrary
date which someone has written.

On my 7th birth day only 'Blakes'
from America visited my orphanage.

May be due to birth day luck among
that much kids, I won the lot.

After a week along with
them I came here.

New country, new house,
new father and mother.

Along with that a new name!

Varun Blake.

But over here also
things were not easy.

At the school for my friends
I was a strange creature!

For the white skinned
parents a black skinned son!

There is a question which
I ask even today to myself.

On that day my Mama's
white finger instead of me...

...what if it pointed on
yet another face?

What will my life be?

Living in anyone ofthe cities in India,
a factory worker living miserable.

1..2..3..

4..6..

8..9..10.

operations and call centre to Infotech.

Hello mother, how are you now?

No pain butfeeling tired.

Brother told mother is not taking
medicines properly, why is that?

No mother it not cold here.

Rohini Mathew? You?

I saw you during the cake cutting.

That's good we are old class mates.

After that I went to Bangalore.

Notthat from now on all the
recruitments should be citizen's...

...from here, no? Isn't it what is said?

What is husband doing?

That is, must be a citizen from here.

And then?

Do you know the reason why saying
only the citizens from here will do?

If there are some white
skinned in ourteam...

...can avoid the ill-fame that
lndian's snatched away theirjobs!

Sir, except that candidate
Rohini Mathew all the rest are...

Rohit! As a company's CIO project
management is not my job.

When my instructions are not clear...

MC Movie Channel

MC Movie Channel

All have a good opinion
aboutyou here...

...everyone says you are the only
person behind the company's success.

When Ijoined Infotech, our MD
Mahesh Murthy's primary business...

...was palm oil import.

He had started all this business
as a style operation of 'Pranchiettan'

After closing that oil company...

...that Mahesh Murthy is
the CEO of this company.

Over here the closed door talks are,
you are the next CEO of the company.

Why late at office? - Nothing
should complete some work.

Try to go home. The balance
work can be done tomorrow.

MC Movie Channel

How cold it is? In yourAtlanta man.

How was the flight and all?
Korean aiwvays no?

Even in the business
class what a smell of fish!

But to compensate that,
there is yet anotherthing okay.

Hard core hot air hostess
from there to here, for a girl...

...l even offered a job at Infotech.
Just for fun.

What is this man? Who is this?
Is it Balamurali Krishna?

For the landscape in
America, he won't suit at all.

Try some Michel Jackson
or something like that.

This is business contract.

We've quoted 20% less
than the Chapman solutions.

Don't I know you'll check all that?

Sir if you cross check that one.

My goodness, on
hearing the confidentiality...

...infringement, compensation...

...on this, my head spins. You
check all this, sign it and send it.

You are ourthinktank, no?

Even othewvise I'm really
fed up of all this l.T business.

What tension and stress?

Thinking to dispose all this
and return to old oil business.

Happy with what is there.

By the by I've decided
to come next week...

...do you know why came this week?

OurAkash was thrown
out by the university people.

It seems he used
drug inside the campus...

...l've no idea what to do with him.

I'm thinking why
not bring to Infotech?

In life there should be
some responsibility, isn't it?

I don't get any other
idea, do you feel any other?

You talk to him, when you
say he'll listen to you.

Sir, I'll talk.

Brother is handed overto you.

To correct him in proper way

Hello, what happened to cal'?
I forgot to turn offthe light.

I think its battery got drained out.

You are really changed and you
have become an English lady.

Do you hear rock and metal?

These are Varun's CD's -as-
Varun doesn't know Malayalam.

My CD's are lost somewhere.

Do you meet anyone
of our school mates?

I, for a long time ago when I
went for a conference at Baveli.

I'd seen our old Prashanth.

Do you remember Prashanth?
Fat guy with glass?

No, that is 'Gundu' Prashanth. This
is that lean, one who pissed in pants.

He is a pOOFQUV-

Poor guy? Now he is the
vice president of Micro Soft.

You said you left school at 8th, no?

At 9th I also left convent school
and joined a government school.

Father's unexpected death.

Only after death, came to know
that father had lot of debts.

Then mother struggled
a lot and grew us up.

Although late at that time
I understood one thing.

In India, if one is born with 'cross
belt' I mean born with 'sacred thread'.

For all there is only
one way to succeed.

Like that studied with vigor.

From here my home
is two streets away.

So, what is the dinner plans?

Dinner plans, Trisha is with daddy
today. Should boil some left overs.

Friday night left overs?

Good one, I was ready to cook
and to give one treat to someone.

Coming?
Do you have cooking and all?

MC Movie Channel

"Searchin some shores 9
I and you all alone"

"As winter descends, we are
in some misty moon night"

"You hear my heart, my silence is music
today without winking the tearful eyes"

"l only see your beautiful face"

From where did you
learn all this cooking?

Mother is the guru. During the
childhood I used to do home work...

...along with mother by
sitting at the kitchen.

Withoutthe smoke, smell and noise
of kitchen, Maths won't come to me.

"Searchin some shores 9
I and you all alone"

"As winter descends, we
are in some misty moon night"

If there is anyone to give me a
company, then cooking is not a big deal.

To tell the truth, I relax
a lot while cooking.

Now only seeing Krishna, happy.

At the office you always
have a tensed look.

Right from my childhood my
desire was to become a chef.

If this l.T and internet weren't there
I'll be with some pot-belly and all.

By chewing some pan, will be stirring
some sambar in some wedding house.

Look, at last for the taste.

MC Movie Channel

Its hot.

How is it?
Water!

Nagesh came to know Emmy
Williams through a dating web site.

That too two days
just before the murder.

May be might have thought
ofa one night stand...

...with Emmy and gone.

From Emmy I got the details
of the restaurant where they went.

But from the restaurant
didn't get any vital clue.

Surveillance camera
footage from that anything!

Now that is the only hope.

MC Movie Channel

How come out here?

Why sitting here?

The court decree is
shouldn't come 50 feet near me.

We both are like two
shores of a river.

Like a small boat,
Trisha who connects us.

I did the masters here in Brown. We
met at the university's Indian club.

The beginning was through
friendship, Varun liked me.

For me also but when looking back
now. Was it love or an escape...

...from an forced arranged
wedding by the parents.

On asking that I don't know.

Sit.

After Trisha was
born, Varun's insecurities.

Lot of anger issues
are there for Varun.

Unnecessary blaming.

Even on the anger of an argument.

It was an accidental firing.

Nageshwara Rao's phone records.
Few days before the death happened.

Fortwo days on a particular
number more than 15 calls.

MC Movie Channel

From the surveillance camera
footage from the restaurant.

It is seen that Nagesh
talking to an unknown.

As if aware of the surveillance
camera's position.

The suspect is standing
turning away from camera.

Did Nagesh enter inside
that carat his will...

...or did suspect threaten
and take him?

By hiding a weapon
inside the coat.

The suspect threatens
and takes him...

...that is Steve's argument.
That was not okay to me.

Nagesh's body
language looks relaxed.

If that is the case between
Nagesh and this suspect.

Some previous contacts.

MC Movie Channel

What's up with that invoice?

Even if by sitting at night
for a while, get it done.

But its just boring to work at night.

Mr. Akash Murthy when
Ijoined this company.

This was 50 employee company.

Behind this success story I've
sacrificed many of my nights.

There is a quote told
by Dr. Abdul Kalam.

The case of Nagesh
had reached a dead end.

Just before the death.

Of Phoenix trucking company's.

Nagesh was one of the
smartest software engineers.

Because of his trip routing
software which he had designed.

Was able to cancel 50 routes which
weren't profitable. For that company.

Because ofthat re-routing,
within last 5 years...

...257 drivers were terminated
by Phoenix trucking company.

If anyone of them, who
had lost theirjob...

MC Movie Channel

Now only knowing there is a
strike like this in this country also.

That is that employees of BPO
team, all their unit was out sourced.

To India. -But still the terminated
employees their situation its a pity no?

Atlanta is running only because
of four major companies.

So, all of a sudden when these
much people are Iay-offed.

Whoever does ourjob cheaper than
us, the project will go to them.

But still on saying there
is no job all of a sudden.

Anyhow I don't sympathize
on these white people at all.

Because for a long time by
selling us they made money, no?

Waking up only now?

Then what's up with
the lunch plans and all?

Forlunchjustthinking to
make a curry with onions.

A curry with onions?

On Sundays to manage
her its very tough.

What's my efforts? That is well
known to Thomas J and other directors.

I need to hear only that much.
The rest I'll manage.

That Mahesh Murthy! On seeing
the positive changes on Akash.

He is trying to make his own
son CEO of the company.

When it comes to own children's
affair, even othewvise we Indians-

-have this 'Dhritarashtra syndrome'.

No matter whether the hard
earned company dooms...

...only own blood should enjoy it.

10 years back I've joined in this
company as a programmer.

Today if I've become
the CEO of this company.

I've gained all by myself this
success ofthis company. All by myself!

I'm getting hungry.

Shall we go? - There is a slight
issue on our ERP project.

I'm checking that one, may be
it might take another one hour.

What one hour?

How many books over here, man?

Do you read all these books?

Sir, told you are getting bored, no?

Shall I give one good
teenage company to sir?

You are not bad man. Over here
everything of yours is in good set up.

Sir, you come you relax in this chair.

Have you not gone so far?

No, had told that should give
reportto Mr. Mahesh Murthi.

That too in the afternoon.

I'll give it fast and now itself, I'll...

Mahesh sir is bit busy.
Have you stopped smoking?

Smart boy!
Come, will have a smoke.

Do you know the story of Kama?

Karnan, means in the
Mahabharatha, Arjunan's...

Will become as a brother.

Before the Mahabharatha war, Indra
Deva had understood one thing.

For the success of his son Arjuna
there one person as a hurdle.

Karnan.

Because of protective shields only
Karnan can't be defeated by anyone.

Then Indra did a gimmick.

He dressed up as a Brahmin
and appeared before Karnan.

And he begged this
protective shield as alms.

As Karnan was a giver, he took off
his protective shield and gave to Indran.

That is how in Mahabharatha
war Karnan failed.

Now this is the question,
must answer honestly.

If you were in the Karnan's
position what would you do?

Honestly saying if I were the
one, I won't give it.

Then what if some people comes
and asks I'm not mad at all to donate.

You may go I'll give this
file to Mahesh Murthy.

What happened? - What if that
girl goes and complaints?

Who?
Asking who?

I didn't do anything.
This is not our country.

She is...Do you know one thing, I
was sitting here and listening to music.

I can understand, you go
and wait in the car.

She showed her character.
Sir, you wait in the car.

You believe me.

Go, go.
What she says is.

You talk and make her understand.
I understood. - I'll wait there.

MC Movie Channel

What a nuisance is this? She is
mad, didn't you speak to Michelle?

What is she saying?

She is adamant, if she presses
the case, its a huge law suit.

Our company may even
lose the Cardgill project.

If its known outside, its
a big stinking issue.

We must somehow solve this,
you please talkto her once again.

Why is that, like that?

For the stupidity which is done by
sir why should I clean up that?

Is it so?

What is this Krishna?
Isn't it true?

There is a news that new
CEO is coming for Infotech?

What is heard is Akash
Murthy's name.

That if when each directorsHThey
might have their own opinion, is it?

Its not like that...
That's not what I heard.

It was sir who suggested his name.

Hey what is this?

When there is your support, not him
anyone can run company, no?

This is all one team work, no?
We as one family and all.

But on this Saturday when
the board meeting is held.

Sir will suggest my name!

If not?

If not, I'll make Michelle
to press the case!

Ho, big deal! Is she the
sister of Satyavan?

If she says who is going
to believe what proof is there?

This world will know what
this real Mahesh Murthy is.

For doing pimping job to sir,
I should get some benefit is it?

You all peoplejointed,
is it forthis, I made you...?

On the hand which fed
milk, on that hand itself...

Sir what did you think of me?

What to sir's whims and fancy, a
poor Brahmin lad who dances to it?

Like old coconut oil business
by extracting everything.

Do you think I can be thrown?

Shall I go?

Didn't you get my dinner invitation?

Got it, why one formal dinner plan?

There is something tricky on that.
Come on tell.

I'll tell.

One among that I'll say.

This Saturday Infotech is going
to announce their new CEO.

Since its office, can't
even love properly.

Aaha, sister is not bad!
Look the lift has come, come.

MC Movie Channel

Why seems so mood out?

No, nothing.

Did that Michelle say anything?
No. What is it?

What happened?

I only had to face
violence from Varun.

Between me and Michelle.
No otherthings had happened.

A game to become a CEO, isn't it?

Krish, there is something
called integrity.

From a male that is
what a female desires a lot.

Not even girl friend, even
the mother of Krish.

To love such kind of a son.

There are roots, branches and fruits.

But its not a tree.

Do you know the answer?
Human being.

Yes! Human beings have un
seen roots, branches and leaves.

The roots may be many. The
language, the nation, lovers.

Mother, it can be anything.

But all the roots search for the
dampness, its name is the same.

The love, kindness, trust.

Which grows in the dampness
of all this, that is life.

Sometimes there may be rotten
leaves bearing the burden of...

"disappointment, good
