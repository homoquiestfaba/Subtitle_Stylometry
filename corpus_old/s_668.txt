That's a nice boy.

Go get 'em, Dulli.

Get in there.

We good?

Oh, yeah. Are we good?
We're beautiful.

We're perfect.

This is grade-A, 100% pure Colombian
cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

Disco shit.

Pure as the driven snow.

<i>My name is George Jung...</i>

<i>federal inmate number 19225004.</i>

<i>I was born in New England.</i>

<i>Massachusetts, actually,</i>
<i>in a town called Weymouth.</i>

<i>That's me.</i>

Come on! Yeah!
<i>And that's my best friend Tuna.</i>

<i>My dad ran a plumbing</i>
<i>and heating company.</i>

<i>He had three trucks, ten employees,</i>
<i>and did big jobs.</i>

Hey! Did you do it?
<i>He was my hero.</i>

-Yeah, it was great. I didn't fall once.
-Attaboy. See you tonight.

Can I come to work with you?
Let's go. Say good-bye to the kid.

Clam it, Bill. I'll talk
to my boy as long as I want to.

You got a problem with that?

Do you really want to come?

Oh, what the heck. All right.

All right. Get your boots.
Thanks, Dad, thanks!

Bill, what's your problem?

Guess who's on cleanup today,
and buying lunch.

Money. M-O-N-E-Y.
That's your job--

<i>Dad was a hard worker, but he didn't</i>
<i>make enough money to keep Mom happy.</i>

Why do you think I married you?

<i>She thought she'd married</i>
<i>above her class...</i>

<i>and he promised her the moon</i>
<i>but didn't deliver.</i>

<i>The truth was, business got slow</i>
<i>and we were broke.</i>

Don't touch me! Look at your hands!
You're disgusting!

Not in front of the boy.
The boy, the boy. What about me, Fred?

Mom, wait! Where are you going?
Go home, George!

Mom, where are you going?

<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>my mother would leave...</i>

<i>no matter how many times</i>
<i>she embarrassed him...</i>

<i>he always took her back.</i>

<i>He loved her.</i>

<i>God, he loved her.</i>

Ermine.

Come here.

Are you okay? Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

Hiya, George.

I'm home.

Come on, give me a hug.

Come on, Georgie.

Come to Mommy.

George.

Come give your mother a hug.

<i>For ten years, my father worked his ass</i>
<i>off 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.</i>

<i>He didn't care</i>
<i>as long as we were happy.</i>

Okay, what do I have to do?

<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>he didn't make enough.</i>

<i>Slowly but surely,</i>
<i>he lost everything.</i>

<i>We were bankrupt.</i>

-Let's get some ice cream.
-I don't care about ice cream right now.

What are we gonna do?

It'll be all right, George.

It'll work out.
It always does.

I'm gonna find another job.

Look, George,
this is the way it goes.

Sometimes you're flush,
and sometimes you're bust.

When you're up,
it's never as good as it seems...

and when you're down, you never think
you're gonna be up again.

But life goes on.
Remember that.

Money isn't real, George.

It doesn't matter.
It only seems like it does.

You gonna tell that to Mom?

Yeah, that's gonna be
a tricky one.

Hey, Dad.
What?

Are we gonna be poor?
'Cause I don't ever want to be poor.

Then you won't.

<i>I decided right then and there</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna live like that.</i>

<i>I needed to get</i>
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

<i>I moved to California</i>
<i>in the summer of 1968...</i>

<i>with the Tuna.</i>

<i>We had $300 and a black TR-3.</i>

<i>Sure was nothing like this back home.</i>

<i>It was paradise.</i>

<i>We got a small, one-bedroom</i>
<i>apartment right on the beach.</i>

<i>It wasn't much,</i>
<i>but it had its perks.</i>

George.

You need some help?

<i>California was like nothing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen before.</i>

Hey, where's the beer?

<i>People were liberated,</i>
<i>independent, full of new ideas.</i>

Hi. This is Tuna.

<i>They used words like</i>
<i>"right on",  "groovy",  "solid".</i>

<i>The women were beautiful...</i>

<i>and they all seemed to share</i>
<i>the same occupation.</i>

I'm a stewardess.
I'm a stewardess.

Yeah. On the airplane.

<i>And everyone was getting stoned.</i>

Hi.
Hello. Hi.

Hello.
Hey, Tuna.

Oh, my God.

I figured it out.

Figured out what?

You know how we were wonderin'
what we were gonna do for money...

bein' as we don't wanna
get jobs and whatnot?

Yeah.
Check this out.

Oregano?

Tuna, this is crap.
Look, we're selling it.

We're gonna make up three-finger lids
and sell 'em on the beach.

If we move all that, we got,
like, like, a hundred bucks.

And if we don't,
we can smoke it.

You got ripped off.
It's not a bad idea.

I-I got the Baggies
and everything.

Look, if you really want to score
some dope, I got the guy.

<i>"The guy" was Derek Foreal,</i>
<i>a Manhattan Beach legend.</i>

<i>He owned three restaurants, two</i>
<i>nightclubs and a chain of Laundromats...</i>

<i>but more importantly...</i>

<i>he owned the first male hair salon</i>
<i>in all of Southern California.</i>

Barbie!

<i>Maria</i>

Hey, Sandy.

So this is the new man, huh?
He's cute.

George.

Tuna.

Hello, Tuna.

<i>Enchanté,</i> George.

Barbie, he is yummy.

He looks just like a Ken doll.

Ken and Barbie. Oh, my God.

It is so perfect.

Girls, give me about five minutes.

I wanna talk alone to the boys.

Have fun.

Gentlemen.

All right, everybody, shoo.
Come on.

Chop, chop.
Give us a few minutes.

Chop, chop, chop, chop.

Go blond, Ron.
Very nice, Heather.

Now, what can I do
for you guys?

We'd like to buy some pot.

I know what you want.

But first, are you cops?

No.

If you are, you have to tell me.
If not, it's entrapment.

We're not cops.
We're from Massachusetts.

Does he look like a cop?

Actually, no.

You know, it's a good thing
you're friends of Barbie's...

'cause if you weren't...

I would never talk to you.

What the fuck is that?

It's your pot.

Wow.

That's more than we had in mind.

I don't nickel-and-dime.
Do you want it or not?

We'll take it.

<i>Tuna and I became</i>
<i>the kings of Manhattan Beach.</i>

<i>If you bought grass,</i>
<i>you bought it from us.</i>

<i>The bills were paid, and I was making</i>
<i>more money than I could at a real job.</i>

<i>I built a reputation for myself.</i>

<i>People even started calling me</i>
<i>Boston George.</i>

<i>It was perfect.</i>

This is it for me.

What is it?

Everything.

You, California, the beach...

this spot right here.

Just finally feel like
I belong somewhere, you know.

I feel right.

You're happy.

Yeah, I am.

You?

Good.

Look what the cat dragged in.

Holy shit. Dulli!

Man.
What the fuck are you doing out here?

Man, I'll tell ya. I was walking
down the beach, minding my business.

Who do I see? This fuckin' guy.

I didn't know you guys
were living out in California.

Yeah. What are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation, man.

I'm on my way back to school.

Oh. Well, this calls for a joint.
You wanna do the honors?

No, man. I'm too fucked up.

That's nice weed, huh?

Fuck, yeah. I've never seen anything
like this. I'm fuckin' wasted.

Right on.

Man.

I'm fuckin' stoned.

I'm fuckin' stoned.

I'm really stoned.

I'm fuckin' stoned, man.
I'm really--

Stoned?

Yeah!
Yeah.

Man, I wish there was
stuff like this back at home.

Yeah?
Fuck, yeah!

You know how much money I could make
with this stuff back east?

Yeah?
No shit, Kev?

That's right.
Yeah?

When there's stuff to move,
it's too easy not to.

Do you know how many colleges
there are within a 60-mile radius?

U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.
Smith, Hampshire.

Right. And Holyoke.
Holyoke.

There's 100,000 rich kids
with their parents' money to spend...

and there's never anything around--
nothin' good, anyways.

I'm spendin' 400 bucks on shit.

Yeah?

The way I figure it...

Barbara flies back east
twice a week...

two bags per flight,
25 pounds in each bag.

That's a hundred pounds a week.

I know it's a lot of weight, but you
can't get pot like this back home.

I'm telling you, Derek, it'll sell.

I don't know.

The best part--
we can charge 500 a pound.

Come on, George.
No one's gonna pay that.

It's already been negotiated.
It's done.

The money's there waitin'.

Goodness.

Goodness is right.

Listen.

I want you to be my partner
on this thing, Derek, 50-50.

If you do the math, that's
over 30 grand a week profit.

That's $ 15,000 a week
for you, my friend...

in your pocket, free and clear.

And I just deal with you?

Barbara and me. No one else.

It's gonna work, Derek.

I don't know. East coast, airplanes.

I'm paranoid. It seems really risky.

Derek, she's a stewardess.

They don't check her bags.

Bye.

Hey, Barbara!
Kevin.

See this suit? Gabardine.

See you.
Okay. Bye.

Barbara!
Kevin.

More. I need more.

Hey, Kevin.
I need more.

I need more.
What do you want me to do?

I can only carry two bags,
and I can't fly back here every day.

I know, but I got
a feeding frenzy on my hands.

This is small potatoes.
We're missing out on some serious cash.

Tell George. He'll think of something.
I will.

Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Dulli!
We made it!

20, 40, 60, 80, nine.
20, 40, 60, 80, one thousand.

A hundred and twenty-eight
thousand dollars.

Jesus Christ, I'm gettin' a boner
just lookin' at it.

Do you believe it, George?

What's the matter, George?
Is something wrong?

Cheer up. Half of this is ours.
We're fuckin' rich.

It's not enough.
What?

What the fuck are you talking about?
The setup is wrong.

We're doing all the legwork,
and we're still paying retail.

We're gettin' fuckin' middled.
So?

So we need to get to the source.

The source? What about Derek?
He's gettin' middled too.

Derek's our partner.
What's good for him is good for us.

So we need a source.

Where do we start?

Either one of you guys
speak Spanish?

Tuna! Get the fuck in here!

Go on, play.

<i>Salut,</i> then. <i>Salut?</i>

<i>Salud.</i>
<i>Salud.</i> Cheers.

Smokee?
Smoke-um?

Do you have some pot?

<i>¿Donde esta</i> pot?

Do you know where we can get some pot?
No. No.

<i>El-- El</i> weed.

Do you know where
we can find some marijuana?

Take a little off the top.

Marijuana? Smoke--

So, you got anything?
I haven't asked yet.

What?
I didn't ask yet. Go ahead.

Come on, are we--

I'll be back.

Santiago.

Ramon tells me you're
looking for some <i>mota.</i>

Yeah, I am.

For instance, uh,
something like this, eh?

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that'll do it.

I'll take it.

You're funny. Really.

How much will you be needing?

All of it.

Yeah, I'll come back
in a week with a plane.

<i>Mi madre. Oye, Americano,</i>
maybe we're going too fast.

You take a little,
and then come back.

Yeah, but I don't need a little.
I need a lot.

Hang on a minute. Listen.

Senor. Tell you what, amigo.

What about I come back...

and I bring you, say...

$50,000?

That alleviate
some of your concerns?

Amigo, you bring me $50,000...

and I have no more concerns.

I can't believe
we're stealing a plane.

Don't be such a pussy. We're not
fuckin' stealing it, we're borrowing it.

Be cool, boys.
Got a little company here.

Let's go. Come on, let's go.

Tuna, let's go. Tuna.

Good luck. I'll see you in the desert.
Right.

You sure you know what you're doing?
George, relax, all right?

I've flown with my old man
a million times.

It's not the taking-off part
you gotta worry about, it's the landing.

Good to see you.
You're a man of your word.

Listen, you know
the 50,000 I promised you?

Couldn't get it.

So I brought you 7 5 instead.

Go!

Merry Christmas, Derek.

Merry Christmas!

It's beautiful.

You're a genius, George.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

This would make
a fabulous Christmas card.

Get my camera, Sven.

George! Did you see the bedroom?

I love it! It's so pretty!

Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it.

Hi. My God!
Hi.

What do you think?
Are you kidding?

Yeah? You want it?
Mm-hmm.

We'll take it.

Cannonball!

<i>It was a great time in our lives.</i>

<i>The seven of us</i>
<i>were like a family.</i>

<i>We worked hard, we played hard,</i>
<i>didn't have a care in the world.</i>

<i>It was perfect.</i>

I can't get over the size of that ring.
I just love it.

Look at it, Fred.
Tell me you don't love that ring.

I'm just happy that George here
has found somebody he cares for.

Yes, of course, but I'm talkin'
about the ring. It's somethin' else.

George has exquisite taste.
What is it, two carats?

It's gotta be at least two carats.
I don't know.

Yes, it's definitely two carats.
Treasure it, darling.

You might wanna get that insured.
Okay, Mom.

Hard to imagine being able to afford a
ring like that on a construction salary.

Oh, shut your big, fat mouth.

You don't buy it all at once.
It's called layaway.

Layaway, schmayaway--
Yes, layaway.

Something you wouldn't know
anything about, you cheapskate.

Cheapskate, beapskate.
Yeah, you, you big tightwad.

He still has his communion money.

Don't listen to her. Yap, yap, yap.
George, tell your father--

George, you tell your father
about layaway.

Layaway.

The boy's happy, Fred.
Don't be such a killjoy.

I'm not a killjoy.
Oh,Jesus, babe.

Put your head up.
Put your head back.

My, Barbara.
Here, take my napkin.

I'll be okay.
I'll get you some ice.

Irene, we need some ice.
Yeah, she's all right.

You wanna go?
Yeah, let's go.

Come on. You haven't had your entree.
No, it's okay.

I'm gonna leave the tip.

I hope you're feeling better.
It was lovely to meet you.

George, give your mother
a call in the morning.

What a lovely girl.

Is that all hundreds?

Yeah.

Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Honey, would you be bummed out
if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

No, not if you don't wanna.

Listen, I gotta apologize
about my parents. That was--

They weren't that bad.
They were kinda cute.

I'm not sure about that.

I want you to promise me something.

I want you to promise me
that we're never gonna be like that.

I don't wanna wind up like them.

We're gonna wind up like us.

Yeah?

I love you.
Get in the car.

Hurry, before they come out.

<i>GeorgeJung, you stand accused...</i>

<i>of possession of</i>
<i>660 pounds of marijuana...</i>

<i>with intent to distribute.</i>

<i>How do you plead?</i>

Your Honor, I'd like to say
a few words to the court, if I may.

You're going to have to stop slouching
and stand up to address this court, sir.

All right, fine.

Well, in all honesty...

I don't feel that
what I've done is a crime...

and it's illogical and irresponsible
for you to sentence me to prison.

Because, when you think about it,
what did I really do?

I crossed an imaginary line
with a bunch of plants.

I mean, you say I'm an outlaw,
you say I'm a thief...

but where's the Christmas dinner
for the people on relief, huh?

You say you're looking for someone
who's never weak but always strong...

to gather flowers constantly,
whether you were right or wrong...

someone to open each and every door,
but it ain't me, babe.

No, no, it ain't me, babe.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

You follow ?
Yeah.

Gosh, you know, your concepts
are really interesting, Mr.Jung.

Thank you.

Unfortunately for you,
the line you crossed was real...

and the plants you brought
with you were illegal.

So your bail is $20,000.

I--
Next case, Your Honor.

Number 14173.

George.
Hey, babe.

What are you doing here?

Surprise.

You didn't have to come
all the way out here, babe.

What, and miss all the fun?
Not a chance.

So...

what's the verdict?

The lawyer says he can plead it
down to five years.

I'll serve two.

Two years?
Yeah.

Two years.

George, I can't wait that long.

Are you kiddin'? You're not gonna wait
for me? What the fuck is that?

I don't have two years.

What?

<i>Losing Barbara to cancer</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

<i>The old gang broke up.</i>

<i>Tuna stayed in Mexico.</i>
<i>God only knows what happened to him.</i>

<i>The point is, we all lost touch.</i>

<i>I'd skipped bail in Chicago</i>
<i>to take care of Barbara...</i>

<i>and was now a fugitive on the run.</i>

<i>It'd been almost a year</i>
<i>since I'd seen my parents...</i>

<i>and believe it or not...</i>

<i>I actually missed them.</i>

Hi, Mom.

Surprised to see me?

Take off your boots.

You're tan.

Mexico.

Yeah. I heard about it.

I want you to know I'm--

I'm deeply sorry
about your girlfriend.

Barbara.
Yeah, Barbara.

Nice girl.

Thank you.

You been getting the money
I send you?

What, you mean the drug money?

Yeah, I got it.

Oh, God.

What are you doing?

What are you doing, baby?

It's okay, Mom.

George?
It's okay.

Georgie!
Hi, Pop.

I thought I heard somethin'.
How are ya?

Good.
Ah, son, come on in.

Oh, yeah. You look good.

<i>May the wind always</i>
<i>be at your back...</i>

and the sun upon your face.

And may the winds of destiny
carry you aloft...

to dance with the stars.

Cheers, Georgie.
Cheers, Pop.

Are you all right?

Just low, you know.

You really loved her.

Yeah, Dad.

I really did.

Are you mad at me?

Yeah, you are.
No.

-I can tell by how you're looking at me.
-I'm not mad, George.

I just don't understand
what you're doing.

I don't understand your choices.

The goddamn cops
are looking for you.

I know.

I'm great at what I do, Dad.

I mean, I'm really great
at what I do.

Let me tell you somethin', George.

You would've been great at anything.

Anything.

Goddamn!

Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em! Fuck!

I had no choice.

Don't look at me like that.

Let's go.

What was I supposed to do?
-Jesus Christ, Ermine.

He was in our house!
Shut up!

What, was I supposed to be
an accomplice?

You don't think people know
you're a drug dealer?

Everyone knows you're a drug dealer.
It's no secret.

How do you think
that reflects on me?

Every time I go out,
I'm humiliated.

So you go to jail.
It's for your own good!

You need to straighten
your life out!

What are you looking at, Mrs. Gracie?
Your son's no prize.

Stop.

Open up cell number three!

The prisoner is in!

Close cell number three.

Hello. My name is Diego Delgado.
How do you do?

Hey, George.
What?

If you don't mind me asking...

what is the reason
you are in this place?

I don't want to talk about it.

Oh, come on, George.

If we are to be friends,
we must trust each other.

I don't like a lot of conversation.
Me too.

Too much blah-blah-blah.

But we are roommates.

We must talk to each other.

I'm arrested for stealing cars...

for the grand theft auto.

Murder.

Murder.

What do you got down there, Diego?

Nothing.Just a little project.

What kind of little project?

Never mind.

Not for you to worry.

Come on, I thought you said
we're supposed to be roommates...

tell each other everything,
all that kind of shit.

You have your intrigues,
I have mine.

Today is a happy day
for me, George.

Nine months from today,
I'll be in Medellin sipping champagne.

In nine months, I'm free.

I'm happy for you.

Yeah.

How much time do you have?

Oh, let's see.

Twenty-six months.

Twenty-six months?

For murder.

I must meet your lawyer.

I gotta get out of here, Diego.

Only two ways I know
to leave here early.

One is to escape.

Okay, what's the other?

Uh, all right, I guess
we oughta open our books.

Man, fuck you!

We ain't openin' shit.
That's right.

You're just the warden's little bitch.
We're hip to you.

Doin' this shit
to get some time cut off.

What the fuck. Why not?

I want to get out of this shit-hole
as quickly as fuckin' possible.

But for me to walk early...

some of you has gotta graduate.

You should forget it.
You're hopeless. Go to sleep.

Fuck you. See ya in the shower.
-Jive-ass turkey.

The rest of you might be able
to get diplomas and get jobs...

when you get back on the outside.

Shit, I'm in this bitch for life.

I'm a criminal.
Ain't nobody givin' me no fuckin' job.

Well...

then let's learn
some criminal shit too.

Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

About half the time, I teach you
about this George Washington character.

The other half, I teach youse
how to smuggle drugs.

You don't know dick
about smugglin' no drugs.

Oh, no?

I was arrested in Chicago
with 660 pounds of grass.

I think that qualifies me.

How the fuck you get
660 pounds of weed?

Flew it in from Mexico
on a single-engine Cessna.

So, we got a deal or what?

What?

I listened to what you said
to the class today about the smuggling.

Never believed
you were a murderer.

I knew you were a <i>magico.</i>

I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.

Do you know, in my country
I'm a <i>magico...</i>

a man with a dream...

a man on the rise...

to take nothing
and make it something.

Do you have a dream, George?

Well, I would if I could
get some fucking sleep.

You have a dream.

And maybe you will accomplish it.

But yet you failed. Why?

Because I got caught.
No, <i>manito.</i>

You failed...

because you had the wrong dream.

What do you know about cocaine?

First of all, what type
of planes do you have?

They're four-passenger,
single-engine Cessnas.

Four passengers.

So that means--

How many kilos
we can fit on those planes?

I don't know. Probably 100, 150.

<i>Danbury wasn't a prison...</i>

<i>it was a crime school.</i>

<i>I went in with</i>
<i>a Bachelor of Marijuana.</i>

<i>Came out with</i>
<i>a doctorate of cocaine.</i>

<i>And after 16 months...</i>

<i>I was once again a free man.</i>

<i>Well, not altogether free.</i>

<i>The conditions of my parole were that</i>
<i>I had to live at my parents'house...</i>

<i>and find a job.</i>

<i>Hello.</i>
Diego Delgado, please.

<i>Boston George. Today is the day.</i>

<i>Are you out?</i>
Yeah, I'm out.

<i>Congratulations, my brother.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

How are we doing?
<i>Fine.</i>

<i>Everything is perfect down here.</i>
<i>Everything is all set up.</i>

Do we need a plane? How does this work?
When do I see you?

<i>Slow down. You need to come down here.</i>
<i>Everybody meets everybody.</i>

<i>We do one for good faith...</i>

<i>and then we talk about airplanes.</i>

I can't go anywhere.
Georgie! Nice and cold.

All right, Pop.
One-- One minute.

I'm on fuckin' parole.
I can't leave the state.

<i>But, George, you'll be back</i>
<i>before they know you're gone.</i>

I just got released
five minutes ago.

<i>George, are we</i>
<i>gonna do this, or not?</i>

My friend.

How are you?
Fine. Good to see you.

Okay, 15 kilos it is then, okay?

We receive $ 100,000 upon delivery.

Not so fast. No, no, no.

I would like to
go over the details.

What details?

I put the coke in the false bottoms,
and I take it through customs.

That's it.

Tell me about the suitcases.

Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What?

Clothes.

In the suitcase.

Yeah, okay.

Okay, yeah, let's try it.
Why not?

Whose clothes? Your clothes?

Okay, Diego, what the fuck
is going on here?

You pulled me all the way down here
to talk about fuckin' clothes?

I demand to know everything.

I do not trust $600,000 worth
of coca to someone I don't know.

It's 15 fucking kilos.
I piss 15 kilos.

Hey, hey, hey! Gentlemen, please. Hey.
You're an amateur.

There's no need
to be impolite, okay?

George, Cesar
is just being thorough.

And that's all, okay?

Okay, very well.

But just remember, Mr.Jung...

I will be with you the whole way,
and I will be watching.

<i>When you're carrying drugs</i>
<i>across the border...</i>

<i>the idea is to remain calm.</i>

<i>The way I do it is to think</i>
<i>of something pleasant--</i>

<i>a fun party, a moment of triumph...</i>

<i>a sexual encounter.</i>

<i>I actually project myself</i>
<i>to that place.</i>

<i>A little Transcendental Meditation,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

<i>The trick is to imagine</i>
<i>every little detail.</i>

<i>Anything to keep your mind</i>
<i>off the fact...</i>

<i>that you're going to jail</i>
<i>for a very long time...</i>

<i>if they find the 15 kilos</i>
<i>of blow in your suitcase.</i>

Passport, please.

Nice flight?
Yeah, it was pretty good. Thanks.

On vacation?
Yes.

On vacation for only one day?

Oh, yeah.
My brother's wedding.

It was a nice ceremony and everything.
It was good.

Open your bag, please.

Sure.

Whose clothes are these?
Mine.

And these?

Old habits, you know.
Hard to break.

Close it up.

<i>The trial period was over.</i>

<i>It was time to start moving</i>
<i>some serious weight.</i>

<i>Commercial flights</i>
<i>weren't gonna cut it anymore.</i>

<i>What we needed was a pilot.</i>

I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel
in the Bahamas, and then on to Medellin.

Please continue.

We make the pickup,
refuel once more in the Bahamas...

and then fly back on Sunday
with the mom-and-pop traffic.

Why are you speaking?

What?
You.

Your responsibility is over. You're
not a pilot, you're not a distributor.

You simply introduced us to Mr. Stevens
and the use of his plane, that is all.

You make a percentage, and a generous
one, and you're lucky to get that.

I see.

How much?

Padrino will pay $ 10,000 per kilo
for everyone-- you, you and you.

Three million.
That is all.

There is no negotiation.
I want two.

A million each
had such a nice ring to it.

No way.

I'm doing all the work, I'm taking
all the risks, and it's my plane.

You guys don't have to do shit.

You just sit back
and collect your money.

You good with this?

Yeah.

That's enough. That's enough!

Do you have pictures of your kids?
What?

I'll need to see them.

I'll also need their names
and the names of their schools.

We are trusting you with millions
of dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.

Without your children,
there is no deal.

Fine.

Mr. Stevens.

Don't forget the pictures.

George, come here!
I need to talk to you!

Yeah! Yeah.

George, come here.
What's the matter?

I mean, aside from the fact...

that we're moving 300 fuckin' kilos
and we're making dogshit...

nothing, really.

A million dollars is not bad.
It's fuckin' chump change.

We may as well be haulin'
suitcases across the border.

You know, George, this is
a very small part of the business.

Very small.

Which reminds me,
I need a favor from you.

<i>The "favor" was to pick up</i>
<i>50 kilos of cocaine.</i>

<i>Fifty.</i>

<i>That's 110 pounds.</i>

<i>Not exactly a small favor.</i>

<i>It's not like bumming</i>
<i>a cigarette, for example.</i>

<i>But what the hell. I didn't have</i>
<i>anything better to do that day.</i>

<i>It's not like I was</i>
<i>on parole or anything.</i>

How you doin'? I'm George.
Friend of Diego's.

Where is Diego?

I don't know.
He sent me. I'm George.

Well, that explains everything.

Open your mouth, George.

Get fucked.

Open your fuckin' mouth.

Now, you listen to me.

You hearing me?

Yes.

I've been holding 50 keys
for Diego for three weeks.

Tell him I don't appreciate it.

You tell him I want my money by Friday.
Can you do that?

I think so.

"I think so".

Hello.
<i>Hello. May I speak to George, please?</i>

George, you have a phone call.

Okay, Mom.

Thank you.

Hello.
<i>Hello? George?</i>

Diego.
<i>Hey, how are you?</i>

How are you?
<i>I'm fine.</i>

Where are you?

<i>Bad news, George.</i>
<i>I'm in Colombia.</i>

Boy, I sure would
like to see you.

And so would some
of your old friends.

You know, George, it's a little bit
hard to get away right now.

I'm afraid you're on your own.

I'm in jail.

<i>What?</i>

Yeah.

What I'm doing here
is measuring the purity.

Pure coke,
it melts away at about 185...

190 degrees.

Cutting agents,
they melt away at about 100.

And quality product, well,
that's melting at around 140.

A hundred and thirty. Good.

A hundred and forty.

Yes.

A hundred and fifty.

Fuck me running!
A hundred and sixty?

Jesus Christ!
A hundred and seventy!

A hundred and eighty.
A hundred--

A hundred and eighty-seven.

Where did you get this stuff?

Colombia.

Well, do you mind if I do a line?
Yeah, go ahead.

Fuck it. Let's all do one.

What'd I tell you, Derek?

It's great. But what am I
supposed to do with all this?

Sell it.
-Jesus Christ, George.

I don't see you in 2 years, and you show
up at my door with 110 pounds of blow?

Just fucking sell it, Derek.

All right, but it's
gonna take me a year.

I can't feel my face.

I mean, I can touch it,
but I can't feel it inside.

Thirty-six hours.
Thirty-six hours.

I don't believe
we got rid of it in 36 hours.

I think it's fair to say you
underestimated the market, Derek.

Right on. It's gonna take us longer
to count it than it did to sell it.

Greetings, Mr. George.

<i>Hola, amigos.</i>
Here you go.

1.35 million. Anyplace
in particular you'd like to count it?

On the plane.

What fuckin' plane?

Thanks.

What the fuck is goin' on here?
Good to see you.

I thought you were in jail.
Pablo used his influence.

Now, watch what you say, okay?
Everybody hears everything.

A lot of things get said, and then--
Let's just say this isn't America.

All right.
Okay? Life is cheap here.

No offense, but you know
what I'm saying.

Right, I'll just keep
my fuckin' mouth shut.

Now, who's this person in California?
The connection?

It's a friend.

Who? I need to know.
It's a friend. A fucking friend, okay?

Who?
A friend. I ain't tellin' you no more.

We'll talk about it later.

Look. That's Pablo.

Oh, shit.

El Padrino...

<i>was Senor Pablo Escobar.</i>

<i>And for those of you living</i>
<i>on the moon for the last 20 years...</i>

<i>he was it--</i>
<i>the boss of it all.</i>

El Magico.

He will see you now.

Okay, let's go.
Not you.

What?

No, you go.
No. Fuck-- Wait.

It's gonna be fine.

What the fuck?
I'm not going over there alone.

You gotta do all the talking.
Remember?

Senor Escobar only wants to see you.
Not me. You go.

This way, please.
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

Take it easy.
It's gonna be fine.

All right. Fuck it.

So...

you are the man
who takes 50 kilos...

and makes them disappear
in one day?

Actually, it was three days.

<i>El Magico.</i>

Greetings, Mr. George.
Welcome to Colombia.

Oh, this man.

He was full of courage.

Informant?

He would have run, fled the country,
gone to the <i>policia.</i>

But then his wife, his children,
his parents, his friends--

Many people would die.

Well, let me take
this opportunity...

to thank you very much for inviting me
to your beautiful country.

Beautiful, yes, but poor.

Coffee, bananas-- these are
our main exports, along with <i>mota.</i>

We've been overrun by the fucking
<i>comunistas,</i> but that is another story.

Our business here today
is cocaine, yes?

<i>Si.</i> Yes, it is.

I need to find an <i>americano...</i>

who I can trust...

one with honor, intelligence--

You need an <i>americano</i>
with balls, Senor Escobar.

Yes, and balls, Mr. George.

Well, look, I can do
several things for you.

I can transport the cocaine
from your ranch here in Colombia...

to the United States,
starting with California.

I got pilots,
I got planes standing by.

Good, good. But I need more details.
What is the cost?

Right off the top of my head--

I'd have to talk to Diego
and everything, but let's just say...

roughly 10,000 per kilo.

How much can you transport?

Again, this is a language that I would
have to discuss with my partner...

but 300 kilos--

So that's $3 million.

This I understand, but--

Please, to remove.
Yeah.

These complications with Diego--

the stolen cars, getting him
released from the <i>carcel--</i>

this causes me much inconvenience.

The 50 kilos could have
been a big problem.

Huh? I don't like problems.

With all due respect,
<i>el "Padroni"...</i>

Diego is my partner...

so I won't negotiate without him.

I won't do business without him.

I just won't.
You sure?

I'm sure.

Let us speak no more of this business.
Let's go for a drive.

We have many other things
to talk about, yes?

I've made a decision.

We're going into business together,
and I want to start right away.

<i>Cocaine exploded upon the American</i>
<i>culture like an atomic bomb.</i>

<i>It started in Hollywood</i>
<i>and moved east in no time.</i>

<i>Everyone was doing it.</i>
<i>I mean everyone!</i>

<i>We invented the marketplace.</i>

<i>In fact, if you snorted cocaine</i>
<i>in the late 1970s or early '80s...</i>

<i>there was an 85% chance</i>
<i>it came from us.</i>

All right.
Three million I counted it twice.

Two-point-five.
Two-point-five. I'm sure.

I'm calling it three.

Then we are half a million off?

Well, fuck it.
I'm not counting it again.

Weigh it.

If it's 60 pounds, it's 3 million.
Fifty is two-point-five.

I don't give a shit.
It's close enough.

Where do I put it?

Try the back bedroom.

No room.
Shit. Try the closet.

We're gonna need a bigger boat.

<i>The Colombians recommended</i>
<i>Noriega's bank in Panama City.</i>

<i>It was either that or launder it</i>
<i>in the States for a 60% surcharge.</i>

<i>What? Keep only 40% of my money?</i>
<i>No, thanks.</i>

Congratulations, gentlemen.

<i>Even Pablo kept his money there.</i>
I love it.

<i>Who was gonna fuck with us?</i>
I'm sorry?

I give you $30 million,
and you give me this little book.

I'm married.
Yeah, I know it.

Can you believe I'm married?
You're a very lucky man.

I love you. I love you.
I'm proud of you.

I love you too, my brother.
I love you too.

Hello.
Hello.

Do I know you?

I don't think so.

No? Why are you smiling?

Why are you smiling?

I don't know.

I'm George.

I know who you are.
<i>El americano.</i>

Mr.Jung, I see you've met
my fiancée Mirtha.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah. Augusto would like
to see you immediately.

Huh?
Augusto would like to see you.

In a minute.

Okay. Excuse us, <i>mi amor.</i>
Go ahead.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Please join us. Have a drink.
Sure.

How are you doing?
Remember Mr. George?

Congratulations on your conquest
of the West Coast.

Thank you very much.

How much bigger can we get?
The sky's the limit.

It's accepted by actors and musicians.
Everybody else will follow.

Actors and musicians?

Actors and musicians.
Actors and musicians.

Very good.

We were just discussing
George's West Coast operations.

Yeah, George's mystery man.

Yes, what is this mystery man?
When do we meet him?

Well, you can't meet him.
George keeps him a secret.

Huh? He's here meeting everybody.

He goes to Colombia, meets Pablo.

But still he keeps his secret,
even from his brother, huh?

George, we're all in this together.
There's plenty for everybody.

You know, I think that <i>el "Padroni"</i>
is happy with the current situation.

Don't you?

I'll be back. Excuse me.

You go.

<i>Breaking up a Colombian marriage</i>
<i>was a serious thing.</i>

<i>A lot of people were pissed off.</i>

<i>Didn't matter. I was Escobar's guy.</i>

<i>I was untouchable.</i>

<i>Mirtha became my running partner.</i>

<i>Beautiful, passionate,</i>
<i>and as crazy as I was.</i>

<i>She could party like a man</i>
<i>and love like a woman.</i>

<i>There was only one problem.</i>

<i>I would always</i>
<i>be a</i> gringo <i>to the cartel.</i>

<i>Mirtha could change all that</i>
<i>with two choice words.</i>

<i>I do.</i>

<i>So do I.</i>

<i>We had the world</i>
<i>by the short and curlies.</i>

<i>We were young, rich and in love.</i>

<i>Nothing could stop us.</i>

<i>It was perfect.</i>

Holy Mother of God.

Put that shit away.
You're pregnant, for Christ's sakes.

Don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

I quit smoking, didn't I?

Just put it away.
My fucking parents are here.

<i>Oh, my!</i>

It's beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, God, it's enormous!

Like it?

Look.

Look at this credenza.

Oh, yes. What, it's Spanish?

How much is one of these?
It's gotta cost a fortune.

It's a family heirloom, Ma.
I've seen these. They're not cheap.

Mirtha comes from
a very wealthy family.

<i>Papi,</i> do you like it? Nice, eh?
Very nice, yeah.

I'll show you the rest of the house.
Great.

George mentioned a Jacuzzi.
I've always wanted a Jacuzzi.

And one of those bidets.
Cocktail?

Yeah. You know, business
has been pretty good.

I got this little import/ export thing
going down in Miami.

That's been very profitable for me.
I got my investments.

I got, uh--
Don't bullshit me, George.

I don't want to waste the time.
I don't see you that much.

You come from my body, remember?
You're my baby boy.

Same kid who would jump off a mountain
if someone told him he couldn't do it.

You haven't changed
that much, have you?

Wow.

I know what you're up to.

Not everything,
but I get the picture.

And I don't care.

I don't like it. It's not
what I would have chosen for ya.

But it's your life.
It's got nothin' to do with me.

I couldn't stop you
if I wanted to, could I?

Probably not.
No.

It's good.

Got a family.

It's good if it makes you happy.

It's nice to have
nice things, George.

Are you happy?

Yeah. Yeah, at the moment,
I am happy, Dad.

Three years?
How long have we been in business?

Three years?
Does she get to meet your connection?

Was she good enough?

Shut up, Diego. Gonna be here
any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.

<i>Carajo,</i> okay? I'm very angry
with you, George. Very angry.

You don't take me to California,
but you take your bitch wife! A woman!

It was you and me who started this.
You and me!

What do you need my connection for?
What are you gonna do with it?

Nothing. It's for the principle.
It's for peace of mind.

Jesus fucking Christ!
I ain't tellin' you.

It's just business.
You're driving me fucking crazy.

I'm driving you fucking crazy?

You're driving me fucking crazy.

We had a dream.
What happened to our dream?

Go inside. Go on.
Shit.

I give you everything.
I give you everybody.

And what do you give me, George?
What do you give me?

No, no, amigo.
<i>No problema.</i>

<i>El dinero esta todo aqui,</i> right?

No problem.
We'll count this shit later.

You embarrassed me, George.
You made me look very bad.

Nothing. <i>Todo esta bien.</i>

No, everything is not right!
I bring you in, and you slap my face.

This is not the time, Diego.

No, listen. <i>Todo esta bien,</i> okay?
Take the keys and go.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck.

Everything's all right.
There's no problem.

Okay? Never happened.

Nobody has to know
anything about this.

Diego, I want you to very calmly
tell these nice gentlemen...

where the fucking cocaine is.

Do it now!

Nice doing business with you,
gentlemen. Good-bye.

Derek Foreal!

What?

Derek Foreal.
Derek fucking Foreal, all right?

Answer to all your fucking dreams.

Happy now?

Derek. Derek Foreal,
Diego Delgado.

Thank you.

Hey! I'm so happy
to see you two!

Look at you. You're beautiful!
You're about to burst!

I am.

Tell her not to drink
too much, please.

I'm so glad to see you.
Me too.

We have a lot to talk about.
Where's Diego?

He's not here.

Where is he? And who the fuck
is this Norman Cay guy?

Everybody's talking about Norman Cay.
Norman Cay this. Norman Cay that.

Do you know him?
He's not a person.

Norman's Cay is an island
in the Bahamas.

From what they say, it's very peaceful,
and that's where Diego has his new home.

As I understand it,
he's bought 160 acres.

A hotel, a marina and an airstrip.

He's doing multiple runs right now,
using the island as a jump-off point.

What?
Yes.

And Jack Stevens is already
a very busy man, along with many others.

Oh, shit.

Hello.

Hello, Derek. George.

Am I wearing lipstick?
I said, am I wearing lipstick?

<i>While I'm getting fucked,</i>
<i>I wanna make sure my face looks pretty.</i>

I don't wanna be in the middle of this.
That's between you and Diego.

I bring you into th-- Hang on.
Happy New Year.

Happy New Year, honey. I bring you in,
this is how you pay me back?

Look, George,
it's nothing personal.

I love you.
This is business.

<i>I gotta go, George.</i>
Derek! Derek!

What's wrong?

What?
Nothin'. Happy New Year.

Welcome, my friend.
It's been a long time.

Don't touch me!

Hey, happy to see you,
George, my brother.

No more brothers, Diego.

Why do you say that? You hurt me,
George. Of course we are brothers.

You fucked me.

I did not.

Yeah, you did.

You went behind my back.
You cut me out. You fucked me.

Me? No. Never, George.

Never.

I talked to Derek.

Well, maybe you're right.

Maybe I did betray you
a little bit.

Yeah.

Yeah, I stole
your California connection.

So what?

Who introduced you
to Pablo Escobar?

Me. Me.

Who introduced you
to your fucking Colombian wife?

Hmm? Me. Who protected you...

when my friend Cesar Rosa wanted
to slice your fucking throat out?

Huh? Me.

Who made you make millions
and millions of dollars?

Me.

And what do I get in return?

This.

Accusations.

I have always given you
everything, George.

Always.

But...

that is over now.

Yeah, this is my operation,
my dream. So go home.

Go back home. Go home.
Go back to your stupid little life.

Go back and sell half grams to your
relatives, for all I care, because--

Because you're out.
And don't be so emotional, George.

We're brothers.
We are brothers.

Yeah!

Next time, it's fucking loaded.

Bye. Bye. Bye.

Say hello to your
pretty wife for me.

Sure.

Hello.

-Jesus Christ!
It's all right, honey.

Look at you.
It's okay.

It's okay, baby. It's over.

I quit the business. I'm out.

It's all over,
and I'm not going back.

It's just you and me and the baby.

And there's nothing else.
There's just us.

You know, fuck it.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck them.
Fuck 'em.

Come here.

Come here.

<i>I did. I quit the business.</i>
<i>Got out completely.</i>

<i>I mean, what the fuck. Why not?</i>

<i>I'd made $60 million,</i>
<i>and I was out clean.</i>

<i>Well, maybe I jumped</i>
<i>the gun on "clean".</i>

Let's go. The baby's coming!
Right, right.

I'm fucking coming!
Jesus Christ!

George, hurry up!

Georgie, let's go!

Right, right, right!
What the fuck?

I'll be right down.

<i>Watching my baby girl being born</i>
<i>did something to me.</i>

Motherfucker!
<i>They talk about religious experiences.</i>

<i>I didn't believe in religion.</i>

<i>Hell, I didn't even</i>
<i>particularly like kids.</i>

<i>But when Kristina SunshineJung</i>
<i>came into this world...</i>

<i>something in me changed.</i>

<i>I knew what I was put</i>
<i>on the planet for.</i>

<i>It was the greatest feeling</i>
<i>I ever had...</i>

<i>followed very abruptly</i>
<i>by the worst feeling I ever had.</i>

Call the cardiologist.
I think he's having a heart attack.

<i>The official toxicity limit</i>
<i>for humans...</i>

<i>is between one and one and a half grams</i>
<i>of cocaine, depending on body weight.</i>

<i>I was averaging</i>
<i>five grams a day, maybe more.</i>

<i>I snorted ten grams</i>
<i>in ten minutes once.</i>

<i>I guess I had a high tolerance.</i>

George, look, I'm not here
to give you lectures.

I have no moral interest
in what you do or don't do.

But take it easy, George.
Stay with us a while.

You have a daughter now.

A daughter.

<i>I came home and cleaned up my act.</i>

<i>I didn't do anything.</i>
<i>No drink, no nothing. Sober as a judge.</i>

<i>My life was all about Kristina.</i>

<i>Being with her, taking care of her.</i>

<i>I wanted to be a father,</i>
<i>a good father...</i>

<i>just like my old man was to me.</i>

<i>After five years of laying low...</i>

<i>still sober, Mirtha</i>
<i>needed to have some fun.</i>

Please excuse me for a minute.
<i>So on my 38th birthday...</i>

<i>she threw a little party</i>
<i>and invited some old friends.</i>

Happy birthday, George.

Mirtha invited me.

Yeah, she told me.

Look, I'm sorry about everything.

You were right. I did fuck you.

And Diego fucked me,
cut me out too.

Yeah, I heard about it.

I lost sight
of everything, George.

Forgot who my friends were.

Well, fuck it.
It's in the past.

Just forget about it. I'm out of
the business, so we'll just move on.

Yeah.
Good to see you, Derek.

You too.

Let's get a drink.
Who's cuttin' your hair?

That's fucking funny, motherfuckers!

Let's have some fucking fun!

-Jesus, is that Mirtha?
Yeah.

Christ Almighty, George.

What does she weigh, 80 pounds?

Yeah, give or take. Come on.

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday, dear George</i>

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

Freeze!
Freeze!

<i>Waiters.</i>

<i>I'm the only guy on the planet</i>
<i>gets busted by fucking waiters.</i>

<i>Why the feds decided to bust me on</i>
<i>that particular night, I'll never know.</i>

<i>Maybe it was the Porsches</i>
<i>and the Maseratis in the driveway...</i>

<i>my Colombian guest list</i>
<i>or the cocaine buffet.</i>

<i>Whatever it was, they were</i>
<i>just waiting for me to slip up.</i>

<i>And I did.</i>

What's this?

This is your statement,
how it was all yours.

The pound of cocaine
was for personal use...

and none of the other guests
had any idea it was there.

Yeah, right.

I want my kid out of protective custody.
Now. No fucking around.

My wife and my daughter
on a plane tonight.

I sign this shit when I know
that they're safe and sound.

No fucking way.
Well, fuck you. I sign nothing, then.

Do it.

Oh, you know what?
One more thing.

Yeah, what?
Get me a six-pack.

Yeah, right.

<i>There was no way in the world</i>
<i>I was going back to prison.</i>

<i>So I signed the deal,</i>
<i>took the rap and posted bail.</i>

<i>Once again, I would become</i>
<i>a fugitive on the run.</i>

Hi, Dad.
Hello, George.

Ermine, your son is here.
Tell him I don't want to see him.

Tell him he's not welcome here.

-Mom.
-Don't you dare step foot in this house.

You're not my son.
You hear me?

I don't have a son anymore.

She's angry, George.

It's been all over the news.

Yeah. I just wanted
to let you guys know...

that I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

You're not gonna go to trial?

No.

So this is it.

I hope not, Pop.

Me too.

I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you.
You take care of yourself.

You too.

Senor Jung.
Yeah?

I wish to present Senor Rodriguez.
He's the president of our bank.

I am afraid that
there is a problem, Mr.Jung.

The banks have gone through a change,
a nationalization.

I am afraid that your funds
have been appropriated...

by the Panamanian government.

Please forgive me.

Someone should have called you
from the bank earlier.

My apologies, please.

What are we going to do?

What are we going to do for money?
Mirtha, please.

I will talk to Augusto.
I'll start working for him.

Just tell me!
Just answer the fucking question!

What do we spend? What?
How will we live?

Not in front of the kid.

Don't give me that shit.
You just better do something.

Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Don't be upset.

What's happening to us?

I don't know.

Are we gonna get split up?

No.Jesus, God,
don't even say that.

Listen to me.
I love your mother.

But she's upset right now.

And you're my heart, kid.

Now, could I live
without my heart?

I hope not.

Take it easy.
There's a fucking cop back there.

Right behind us.
-Just fucking drive.

What is your fucking problem?

We're broke. That's my fucking problem.
And you're a fucking spy.

What?

That's right.
Always spying, always judging.

Right.
Everyone's laughing at you.

You fucking pussy.
Thanks.

You let Diego fuck you in the ass.

Right.
Maybe because you like it.

Maybe because
you are a fucking faggot.

Right.
That's what I think you are.

I think you are really fucking him,
because you're not fucking me.

You gotta be fucking somebody else.
Mirtha, come on.

Why is that?
Take it easy.

Why don't you fuck me anymore?
Mirtha, take it easy.

Why? Why don't you fuck me anymore?
Get over there, Mirtha!

Don't you ever put your hands
on me, motherfucker!

Don't you ever
touch me again, asshole!

Relax.
Get your hands off me!

He's a fugitive
and a fucking cocaine dealer!

He has a kilo
in his trunk right now!

Look, look--

Take this sorry
motherfucker to jail!

<i>I'm divorcing you, George.</i>

<i>And I'm getting custody</i>
<i>of Kristina.</i>

<i>And when you get out next week,</i>
<i>you're gonna pay support.</i>

<i>And that's the end of it, okay?</i>

<i>There is someone else.</i>

I don't think you care,
but I wanted to tell you.

<i>Say something.</i>

<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

<i>I'm in prison.</i>

<i>You should know.</i>
<i>You put me in here.</i>

I knew you would say
something like that.

<i>Always thinking about yourself.</i>

<i>Say hello to your father.</i>
My God.

<i>- Go now. Say hello.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

<i>I thought you couldn't live</i>
<i>without your heart.</i>

<i>Every single day in thejoint</i>
<i>I thought of one thing.</i>

<i>One thing only. My baby girl.</i>

<i>I needed to get my heart back.</i>

Bye, guys.

Anna, sweetie, over here!

Hi, honey.

Hi, honey.
What are you doing here?

Well, I just wanted to let you know
I was out, and I wanted to see you.

How are you doing?

George, you just can't
show up like this.

Why don't you try calling me Dad?

I don't want to, all right?
Now leave me alone.

Wait. Honey, listen.

Kristina, I'm sorry.

I wanna make everything
okay, you know?

What do you want from me, huh?

I want to be your dad again.

I just wanna walk with you,
if you don't mind.

I want to make everything okay.

Please, Kristina.

If you could go anywhere
in the world-- anywhere--

where would you want to go?

<i>I was making headway.</i>

<i>Kristina and I walked</i>
<i>to and from school every day.</i>

<i>Things were starting to look up.</i>
Maybe California.

California? Well, you can go
anywhere in the world.

You can go to India, Tibet,
Israel, France, whatever.

You'd still choose California?
Yeah.

Yeah?
Hey, Mom.

All right.
Well, go-- go on inside.

Bye, Dad. See you in the morning.
Okay. I'll be here.

Hi, Mom.

I'm gonna go inside
and do my homework.

Okay, honey.
I'll be there in a minute.

What do you want?

A truce.

I don't wanna fight
with you anymore, Mirtha.

I just want to get along with you.
You know, be civil.

You know I've been seeing
Kristina, right?

Yeah, she told me.
You walk her to school.

Yeah.

Anyway, I've been thinkin'...

I love her.

You know that. I--

I was thinking I'd
kind of like to have her.

I've been away for such
a long time, you know.

I just--just wanna be with her.

I haven't seen one dollar from you.
You haven't paid me one cent.

Child support, alimony.

You start helping us,
we'll see what will happen.

All right. That's it.

That's all I wanted to say.

Take care.
You too.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

<i>Hello? Derek, hey. George.</i>

Look, I need to do something.

I want to put together a crew, huh?
Know anybody?

It's a four-man operation.
Two on the ground, two in the air.

Who's the copilot?
You're lookin' at him.

We'll provide the plane, transportation
costs, U.S. landing spot...

and we'll take it
wherever you want it to go.

You provide a pickup point
in South America...

and you're responsible for payment.

You also assume all bust risk.

After that, we take 65%
of all transportation fees...

ten percent of the gross,
plus our expenses.

This is not a negotiation, so if it's
okay with you, we can talk further.

If not, forget we had
this conversation.

No, no. Everything sounds good.

I'm gonna need to meet
everybody involved, though.

They're right there
at the table. Come on.

Gentlemen, this is George.

George.
What do you say?

Georgie! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Dulli!

Dulli.Jesus.
Oh, man, George. You look great.

Yeah, so do you.
I've known this guy for 30 years.

George, Ben.
Hey, Ben.

How are you doing? G.G. Have my seat.
Nice to see ya.

Heard you got married.

Hey, honey, you know what?
What?

I was thinking about getting
out of town this week.

Where are you goin'?

I don't know.
Maybe California.

Liar.
Yeah.

Go out there, check it out,
see what it's like.

I got a few things I have to take care
of first, but I was thinking Thursday.

Thursday after school?

You know I can't.
Mom will never let me go.

You let me take care of your mother.
You just pack your bags, okay?

But I've got school.
I know.

But a good friend of mine told me
that they got schools in California too.

You swear?
Yeah.

3:00 Thursday, at your mother's.
You and me, huh?

It's a date.
I don't believe you.

I swear on my life,
scout's honor.

Swear on my life.

I swear on your life.

All right!

That's a nice boy.

Go get him, Dulli.

Get in.

Oh, yeah.

Are we good?
Are we good?

Yeah, we're good.
We're fucking beautiful.

We're perfect.

This is grade-A, 100% pure Colombian
cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

Disco shit.
Pure as the driven snow.

Nice.
Good fucking riddance.

Yeah?

You saved my fucking life.
No, I didn't.

No shit. You'll never know.
Really. All you guys.

Really.
Yeah, yeah.

And being as how I'm feelin'
so fuckin' generous tonight...

you just got a raise.

A raise?
Yeah.

Instead of ten percent,
you're gonna get fifteen.

Jesus, George, 15 percent?
That's an extra 200 grand.

That's right. Fuck it. Do whatever
you want with it. Have a nice life.

I'm out. <i>Finito.</i>
Last fuckin' party.

I'm gonna go out to California,
start a new life with my kid.

Here's to it.

Cheers.
Here's to you, Georgie.

Cheers.
Here's to you, Georgie.

Cheers. All right, fellas.

Dulli.
Yeah?

How about another round?
I'm gonna hit the head.

I feel like a fuckin' kid today.

What?

I feel bad.

Me too.

I like him too,
but what's done is done.

So let's not get all sentimental
about it, all right?

Hey, Dulli, you know
what I was thinking?

I was remembering that--
that time we flew into Mexico.

You remember that fucking
landing strip? Right?

Yeah.
Fucking nuts.

You're much better now.

What's going on?

What the fuck?
What's with the long faces?

Where's my fuckin' knife?

No.

Let's do it.

<i>I was busted.</i>

<i>Set up by the FBI and the DEA--</i>
<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

<i>Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal</i>
<i>to save their own asses--</i>

<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

<i>Sentenced to 60 years at Otisville--</i>

<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

<i>I'd broken a promise.</i>

<i>Everything I love</i>
<i>in my life goes away.</i>

Hey, Arch.
What's goin' on?

Well--

You all right?
I'm good.

Fuck.

What do you got?

Bad news.

Tried to get you furloughed,
but your mom squashed it.

Said it would only upset him.

So, doesn't look good.

How's he doin'?

Not good.
He's out of the hospital. He's home.

But I don't think there's anything
anyone can do for him.

I think it's just
a matter of time.

Got you a tape recorder.

I thought, you know,
he might want to hear your voice.

If you want to say
something to him.

Right.

I'll give you five.

Hello, Dad.

You know, I remember
a lifetime ago...

I was about
three-and-a-half feet tall...

weighing all of 60 pounds,
but every inch your son.

<i>Those Saturday mornings</i>
<i>going to work with my dad...</i>

<i>and we'd climb</i>
<i>into that big green truck.</i>

<i>I thought that truck was</i>
<i>the biggest truck in the universe, Pop.</i>

<i>I remember how important</i>
<i>thejob we did was.</i>

<i>How, if it weren't for us,</i>
<i>people would freeze to death.</i>

I thought you were
the strongest man in the world.

<i>Remember those home movies when Mom</i>
<i>would dress up like Loretta Young?</i>

<i>Ice creams and football games?</i>
<i>Waino, the Tuna?</i>

<i>Day I left for California, only to come</i>
<i>home with the FBI chasing me?</i>

<i>That FBI agent, Trout...</i>

<i>when he had to get on his knees</i>
<i>to put my boots on, you said--</i>

That's where you belong,
you son of a bitch.

Puttin' on Georgie's boots.

That was a good one, Dad.

That was really something.

You remember that?

<i>And that time you told me</i>
<i>that money wasn't real?</i>

Well, old man, I'm 42 years old...

and I finally realize...

what you were trying to tell me...

so many years ago.

I finally understand.

You're the best, Dad.

<i>I just wish I could've</i>
<i>done more for you.</i>

<i>I wish we had more time.</i>

Anyway...

"May the wind
always be at your back...

and the sun
always upon your face...

<i>and the winds of destiny</i>
<i>to carry you aloft...</i>

<i>to dance with the stars. "</i>
"Dance with the stars."

I love you, Dad.

Love, George.

George. George, come on.
You have a visitor.

Hello, sweetheart.

Hi, Daddy.

God, you're so big.

Daddy's a fuckup.

No.

Come here.

You're the only thing
in my life ever meant anything.

You swear?
I swear, baby.

I swear.

I love you, Kristina.

You're the only
good thing in my life.

You're the only thing
ever meant anything to me.

I love you.

Come on, let's go.

So, tell me about your life.

What do you want to know?

Everything, I mean--
What do you do?

You go to school? Do you--
Sometimes.

Yeah?
Yeah.

-Just like the old man.
Yeah.

George. Let's go.
It's gettin' dark.

Come on. It's gettin' late.

Come on, let's go.

Let's go.

I got a visitor.

Not today, George.
Time to go back.

Yeah, but I want to put her
on the list for tomorrow.

It's my daughter.

She's gonna visit me.
My daughter's gonna visit me tomorrow.

<i>So in the end, was it worth it?</i>

It's lockdown time.
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

<i>How irreparably changed</i>
<i>my life has become.</i>

<i>It's always the last day of summer...</i>

<i>and I've been left out in the cold</i>
<i>with no door to get back in.</i>

<i>I'll grant you, I've had more</i>
<i>than my share of poignant moments.</i>

<i>Life passes most people by...</i>

<i>while they're making</i>
<i>grand plans for it.</i>

<i>Throughout my lifetime...</i>

<i>I've left pieces of my heart</i>
<i>here and there...</i>

<i>and now there's almost</i>
<i>not enough to stay alive.</i>

<i>But I force a smile...</i>

<i>knowing that my ambition</i>
<i>far exceeded my talent.</i>

<i>There are no more white horses</i>
<i>or pretty ladies at my door.</i>
