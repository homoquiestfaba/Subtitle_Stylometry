Hey, man, look at buddy
over there with that trumpet.

That's the rock sound.
That's a saxophone, man.

I don't give a fuck what it is.

Look like he sucking dick, man.

Let's bust his head.
It's whatever.

Hey.

I'll hit him with that one, kid.

Nah. He going to catch it
with this, dawg.

You going to catch a case, dawg.

Nah, man, that's too big, kid.

I ain't going to jail for you, man.
For real.

We ain't got to go to jail for you.
Fuck that shit.

Fuck!

What the fuck
was that?

Who the fuck threw that?
I think he went that way, man.

Let's go get him, man.

Blow them away.

Have 'em in your hand and crush them.

Destroy them.

They want you to.

They are your slaves.

Put them out of their misery.

Nate Harris, you ready?

Tonight you become Nemesis,

the people's enemy.

The more you hate them,
the more they love you.

It's the weekend baby.
It's your host Mecca,

aka Grimore, the host with the most
from coast to coast.

I'm chillin' right now in the 305.

We're at the debut performance
of Dade County's next superstar, Nemesis.

The media, the streets,
the rap game loves you.

305, you holdin' it down right now.

But I gotta ask you one question.

Are you ready for the fame?

What's going on, 305?
It's your boy Hell Razor.

Now, I want y'all to give it up

for what y'all really came to see,

your Mr. Miami.

People, make some noise.

Nemesis.

Yeah.

Nemesis.

Raise a brick.

Yo, listen here.

Let's go.
I got my money up

'Cause I'm a solider

We ain't takin' none

'Cause we some soldiers

I'm prepared for war,
just like a soldier

Told you before,
man, we some soldiers

I got my money up
'cause I'm a soldier

We ain't givin' up

'Cause we some soldiers

I'm prepared for war

Just like a soldier

I told you before

'Cause we some soldiers

See, I was raised in the worst way

Waitin' on my own time

Represent the soldier life

Trapped in this world of crime

I came from the dirt

Watch me rise to the sky

I came to put in work

So I'ma ride until a die

Put a slice of the American pie

I need the whole thing

Killin' 'em softly, my nigga

And playin' no games

Better lace your boots

'Cause I'm the grand war

If you ain't real

Then what the hell you starin' for?

Until you walk a mile in my shoes

Don't judge me, just trust me

I'm front page news

The natural born leader

With the strength of the warrior

New world order

Go to war with the officers

Listen, this is a national emergency

You infidel assaulted, captured

From the currency

Yeah.

Yo.

Yeah, she like that.

Man, all them hoes like it like that.

No, we don't like it like that.

Mmn, shut up, ho.

Nate, Nate.

Dan and Jason want
to meet with us now.

We can't be late for this.
A meeting?

Yes.
Am I going?

No.
No?

Yo, you said this show was it, man.

Next time they talk to both of us.

It's probably about the label, man.

Probably about the label, huh?
Yeah.

Yo, it better be, man.
Stop being paranoid, man.

You gonna get on.
We have to go.

All right, man. Get on that, man.
All right.

Sounds kind of fishy.

Let's go over your
schedule for next week.

What's up?

MTV shoot on Monday,

and the previews party, that's at night.

Razor, relax, man. Chill out.

Why, you scared?

Look, they said it was
just for one show, all right?

I'll do the first one.
It'll be a big hit.

Then they'll put us
on an album together.

It better be, man.

How they gonna make you a spit?

You a writer, you ain't no rapper.

That's what I told them.

That shit is crazy.

Great start, man.

The comparin' you to 50,
which is good.

Man, we're gonna make you
the biggest star ever.

Gonna have to act a lot blacker, man.

He means more gangster.

That's ridiculous.

Are you a spokesman?
Because I coulda sworn

you were a manager.

To get there, we gotta
spark some controversy.

We gotta have some bad boy appeal.

You need some kind
of street credibility.

50 Cent was shot 16 times.

You gotta keep it real, Nate.

People live vicariously through you.

They want to be able
to walk in your shoes.

They want to be able to see themself

out of the ground, out of the ghetto,

and getting paid.

But in order to do that,

you gotta become one of them.

You act too uppity,
and they turn on you.

You gotta act like them...

stupid, selfish, sheep, tough, mean,
straight-up gangster.

They gotta be able to relate.

I mean, you can't be
a fuckin' house nigger.

Say what?

Look, this is what we're gonna do.

Tomorrow, at the pre-release party,

we're gonna unveil your myth.

We've detailed a very
specific history for you...

how many times you've been shot,

growing up fatherless on the streets,

body counts... simple things like that.

Should I tell him?

You should.

How do you feel about
owning your own label, man?

President of Nemesis Records,
or whatever you want to call it.

I haven't even started my own career yet.

Look, just call it
a show of faith, all right?

Bring us a new artist. We'll do the rest.

A new artist?
Yeah.

Razor.

Razor, um... Not Razor.

So, to Nem,

and all his success.

Don't worry about Razor.

We'll take care of him, okay?

To Nem.

Yeah.

You said it yourself, man.

You said you would do
anything for your pops, right?

Don't worry about the money.

We're gonna be all right.

Hey, Nemesis.

I believe we were called for.

Go on inside. Have a seat.

I'm Rachel.

This is Jen.

And that's Sheri.

I'm Nate... I'm... I'm Nemesis.

Yeah.

All right, all right.

About to get it crunk up in here.

Yeah, real crunk.

So, Nemesis,

what do you want us to do?

Okay, now...

You, you go over there.

Me?

Nah, the one with the big titties.

Yeah, you.

Yeah.

Yeah, bend over.

Um, now... now, you two...

You two hoes start kissing.

Come on, start kissing.

Oh, no... Stop, stop, stop, fuck.

Skip that part.

Start taking each other clothes off.

Yeah.
Me?

No, not you. You stay bent over.

Yeah, y'all get ready.

'Cause I'm about to come in there,

and I'm gonna be tearing things up.

So just... just be prepared.

Are you gonna start with me?

Drove by your house this morning.

Saw a red car.

It was, um...

Nikki.

No, Sophie.

Sophie?

You don't even know her name.

Who are you anyways?

Come on, gimme a break, Pops.

It's going down, was what they said.

Voice echoed throughout the airwaves
of the entire city.

Hundreds of thousands of radios

projecting the same message.

The new up and coming
sensation, Nemesis,

was blastin' the mic.

Nemesis.

What's the name of your piece?

"Soldier."

What's it about? Who's it about?

Look, I gotta go, Pops.

Got a photo shoot.

Nate, every successful piece
has got to have a story.

Thanks for the breakfast, Pop.

What's goin' on, America?

It's your boy Nemesis,

and welcome to my crib.

The teeth are falling
outta my mouth, man.

It not gonna work, man.

It's your boy Nemesis,
and welcome to my crib.

I'm all right. Let's...

And action.

What's going on, America?

It's your boy Nemesis,
and welcome to my crib.

You know the 305 has the most
beautiful women in the world.

And I had to get 'em to come through
to show your boy love.

And what's a pool party
without some barbecue over there?

You know us black folks
love the chicken and watermelon, right?

Hey, yo, don't forget my album,
<i>Cut Throat,</i>

coming this summer.
Yeah, that's right.

And what's a party without
the entourage in the building?

Entourage, where you at?

What you cooking over here, man?

Fried chicken.
You see how that happens?

That shit just pop up
and it gets big like that.

Look at that. Fried chicken
on the grill. Hell nah.

Fried chicken on the grill, son.

You see that?
Who wants some chicken?

I want some chicken!

Look at their beggin' ass.

Now let's go check out these cars.

That was great, guys. That was perfect.

We're gonna come around
with the camera.

Mark comin' around with the camera.

He's gonna take footage of you guys.

Razor Ric. He's comin' up next, baby.

Don't forget.
I didn't forget about you, boy.

Didn't forget about you.

Hey, Stan, what's up, man?

These the kinda things you get
when you playing with us.

Playing the big time.

Hey, Nemesis,
can I talk to you for a sec?

Look, I'm busy right now.
Talk to someone else.

'Bout to go there and grill
a piece of chicken.

I like chicken.

I want to get into the game.

And what game would that be?
The rap game.

I'm Pearl.

I want you to check me out, all right?

Hey, you know what?

I'll check you out.

Razor, Razor, look.

We were just talking
about Nem's new label.

What about it?

We want to put you under it.

What I tell you about
messing with my head?

I'm not messing with your head.

He's real cute
when he does that.

Don't patronize me, cracker.

Listen, listen, listen.
Just talk to Nem,

and he'll fill you in with
the details, all right?

Yeah, man. You need a Tic Tac, bro.

Jerkoffs, man.

Razor Ric versus Nemesis.

Could be like Biggie and Pac.

A rap feud.

A rap war.

Genius, baby.

Hey, don't touch me like that, man.

I'm serious.

So it's true about your own label?

Jason and Stan already
told me you picked me, kid.

Of course, that goes
without saying, right?

Yeah, of course, man.

Blood brothers, man.

Blood brothers.

Look at these two
booty partners over there.

All jokes aside...

y'all two niggas gay, man.

Hey, Nem,

we want to get on the label, too, though.

You know we all boys, man.

Get up outta here, man.

Both of ya, raise up.

Yeah, I'ma holler at you, man.

The only work y'all two gonna be doing
is on each other mics.

All right, that's perfect, perfect.

Yeah, I'm just gonna
get some video now. Is that cool?

Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

Keep your head up.

Nem, my man.

Your work is on fire
with the young ones right now.

So tell me, who was
your role model growing up?

I ain't never had no role models
but myself.

Sure wasn't my father.

Son of a bitch skipped
town before I could walk.

Yo, Raymond.

Hold up a second.

Come here.

Wait right over there.

You know, there's no
easy way to put this,

but, yeah, basically,
we got to cut you off, man.

What?

Hey, save your breath for the sax, man.

You might need it for your next gig.

Well, see you around, slick.

And, uh, good luck.

Don't worry about the money.

We're gonna be all right.

Doesn't matter how many people watch.

One day they will.

And I've just go to do
what I've got to do.

Change how people feel.

When they walk into a room,

I got to make them feel the music,

show them God's love.

That's what it's all about,

helping others,

touching others,

changing others.

One day, I'm gonna
do that and make money.

Yeah, yeah?

All right.

And now you're number 1 in the MIA?

Hold on. Cut. Cut.

All right, listen.

I'm gonna need you to
give it to me again.

Just tell me about the album,

but yo, hype that shit, bro.

All right, I'm lettin' all y'all know
What's really goin' on in the 305.

This your boy Nemesis.

Look out for my new album
and my single "Soldier"

comin' fresh out the studio
and into your ears.

Get your hand ready.

Crack your Dutchess open.

It's gonna be badder, radder, and fatter

than everything that's
out right now. You heard me?

He just say "radder?"

Wigger.

If you want to be alone,
why are you still in the club?

Well, who said I wanted to be alone?

Then, why are you
when you can be with anyone?

Here, take a hit.

No, I don't smoke.

Oh, you don't smoke?

Anymore.

So all the songs are lies then?

Smoke and mirrors?
No.

Okay, here you go, big shot.

I was smoking when you was in diapers.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah, smokin' since
you were in diapers, right?

Yeah, I bet you were.

It's been a while.

All right.

Let's go have a seat.

Those not regular cigarettes.

Oh, sure they were.

Soaking it all in, huh?

Ah, just getting some fresh air, man.

Ready to hit the main floor.

Do my thing with the label, you know?

Big plans. Got big plans.

Yeah, about that, man.

Um, I got bad news.

Bad news? What kind of bad news?

You off the label, man.

Off the label?

What you mean I'm off the label?

I don't know. Maybe it's
paranoia or something,

but people are scared of you.

People like who?

People like who?

Nem wants you off the label.

Nem? Are you serious?

I know. And I couldn't believe it myself.

But if you want to find out,
ask him yourself.

I will.

I'll do that, all right?

You see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

I will.

I definitely will.

So you a videographer
along with being a rapper and a model?

Yeah, just like you're a gangster rapper.

What does that mean?

Oh, you know what it means.

Don't think too hard about it.

Whatever.

By the way, what'd you think
about some of my tracks?

Oh, your tracks?

I thought it was okay, but I...

What are you doing here, man?

VIPs in there.

That's where you belong.

Let's go, man.
I gotta go.

All right.
I'll work on that for you.

Okay. All right.

Where you going, big boy?

Back to the VIP, pop some bottles?

Yeah, man. Actually, it's kind of hot...

No, no. You ain't goin' nowhere.

What's going on, man?

You tell me what's going on.

Oh, don't play dumb now.

They done told me, man.

They told me everything.

You mean to tell me after all these years
I put into making you,

like that, you cut me loose?

The fuck are you
talking about, Razor?

Shut the fuck up, man.

Everything that comes out
of your dirty mouth is lies.

You talk when I say talk.

Talk, nigga.

Relax, man. There's all
these cameras over here.

All the cameras?

Everybody gather around.

Everybody, come up here.

Special bulletin. Right here, yeah.

You see your boy Nate?

He got so much to say, right?

He be on stage,
he be rappin' his ass off.

Where your rap at now, nigga?

Spit something.

Man, you outta control, dude.

Yo, man, get the fuck outta here, man.

Where the gangsta at now?

Look at the gangsta.

Why you didn't do something,
gangsta rapper?

Why you didn't strike back?

You a fake, man.

I'm the realest.

I'm what they want you to be.

I am hip hop.

You got that?

You remember
when we was kids, man?

Blood brothers? Huh?

If it weren't for me,

you'd be in some fuckin' bar in Detroit,

playing the fucking flute
like your daddy, nigga.

Now blow on that.

Fuck you, man.

You ain't nothin' without me, nigga.

I'ma break you down, nigga.

You a dead man.
Hey, hey, hey.

Break you down, nigga!

Get the fucking camera out of here, man.

Go on.

Hell Razor, motherfucker.

You a dead man, yo.

What up, Miami?
It's your boy, Mecca, aka Grimore,

your host with the most
from coast to coast.

Today we're talking about Nemesis

and his run-in with
his entourage member, Razor Ric.

Now, what I'm hearin'
is Razor accused him

of making up his life story.

And I want y'all to call in right now
and let me know what y'all think.

Is Nemesis real or not?

Jerome from Carol City, you're on.

Ain't nothing real about Nemesis.

He been a fake all along.

When you ever heard
him involved with anything real?

No drugs, no shootings...

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

I gotta cut you off on this one.

Are you telling me that to be real,
you have to shoot somebody?

What if he's not really like that?

Wouldn't that be, like,
fake the fake in being real?

Man, the streets know
what is and what ain't.

I've been in the streets all my life.

I knew that nigga when he was coming up.

Razor is real, Nemesis ain't.

I've been around since
the genesis of Nemesis.

That nigga is a total fugazi, total fake.

total lame... And I'll bust him
in his brains the day I see him

try to ever act like he real again.

How's it feel to get your first airplay?

Told you we'd make you a star, man.

Airplay, excuse me?

Nem's all over.

He's the hottest topic out there.

It's hype, Michelle, great hype.

Hype for who? He's getting destroyed.

He needed a little bad publicity.

It's good.

This isn't bad. This is terrible.

Calm down, Michelle.

We wouldn't want you to become
the first black woman to turn red.

Oh, you want to go, Michelle?

Don't let the suit fool ya, sweetheart.

You need to learn from
Michelle, man. Shit.

She a little bit
more aggressive than you are.

What happened to Razor?

Guess he assumed
that he was on the label,

but freaked out when
he found out that he wasn't.

Look, I need you to
lay low tonight, all right?

Things are really heating up.

There'll be security
waiting for you outside

your house when you get home.

Is this yours?

You wrote these?

And you drew these?

Nah, you lying to me.

Did someone help you?

You look like a school type.

I need someone who can write.

None of the cats where I roll
can write their own name correct.

Me, I rap.

That's all I do is rap.

You looking at that guy over there?

I mean, look at him.

That's sad.

You gotta have a fantasy
to be somebody.

You get it?

Let's get together and colab,

do something.

What's your name, G?
Nate.

Ricky. Call me Razor.

So nice of you to let us join in

on your little studio session, Razor.

Man, if you heard what Nem been sayin'...

Man, he's starting to dig a hole
up in your ass.

Man, shut the fuck up real quick.

Here's what we're gonna do.

First we're gonna
declare war on Nemesis,

with this track right here
I'm about to drop tonight.

And then
we're gonna enforce the war.

You got that?

I got it.

You got that, Gunplay?

So let the games begin.

Hey, Jay, Jay, Jay... Enough, look.

I stuck you with Pansy Stanzy

'cause I thought you could
handle the punk. Of course,

we've seen the way you
deal with situations.

All we gotta do is take
a look at the Razor Ric fiasco.

Well, that was intentional.

Look, I was trying...
Intentional,

to make Nem look like a pussy?

Look... Thank you.

It's not my fault he didn't fight.

You gotta know your men, Jay.

Look, if your partner won't show up

to a meeting with the CEO
of Renaissance Records,

<i>moi,</i> then you
shouldn't include him.

Look, Stan, he said he's on his way.

So he should be...

should be here in a minute. So, um...

He should be here.
So I'm really sorry about that,

but he said he... he's on his way.

So tell me about the operation.

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay, um...

it's this guy.

This guy.

This guy.

This guy. This guy.

Look, I wasn't trying
to waste your time here.

You're wasting my time right now.

What do I care about unknown rappers?

What brings me down here?

Business.

Headline.

Nemesis.

The choir boy himself.

Look, I don't think you get what we're

trying to do here, Stan.
Oh, I get it.

I get it.

You wanna turn Nem
into some kind of pubic gangster

by getting his
best buddy to fight him...

do battle, give him street credibility?

Only Nem doesn't fight.

He lays down like a dog.

Thank you.
Look.

People think he's dangerous now.

All right? All we gotta do
is just pull back...

Pull back a little bit?

Yes, pull back.
Where to?

Sesame Street?

Nem's a target, okay?

He's a stool pigeon.

Fans are about to revolt.

Nobody, and I mean nobody,
likes a pussy.

He just needs to work on his image.

He needs...
Razor's about to blow up.

Razor?
Yeah, Razor.

That was a show.

A show? You think this
is a game to these people?

These fans, you don't think
they take it seriously?

You think they'd be
sitting on drug corners,

knockin' up baby mamas,
wielding guns like the Wild, Wild West

if they didn't take this shit seriously?

You gotta give 'em
something to follow.

Give 'em an example.

You gotta go all the way, Jay.

Look,

Jay... Jason.

Jason, look at me.

The fans want blood,

so we have the rappers preach it.

The rappers preach it
so the fans want it more.

It's a circle of life.

We're all victims here,
and you know this.

We gotta up the ante.

305's ready to profit from war.

Get Razor back into the fold.

He is your franchise.

If Nem survives Razor and the fans,

well, hey, he's a frickin' legend.

If not, well,

he's worth more dead than alive.

If your boys become lames,
we lose fans.

We lose fans,

might have to lose you.

You got me?

Yeah. Yeah.

Do me a favor.

Tell Stan I said "Fuck you."

Razor?

Hey, man, it's Jason.

I got good news, man.

Artists only.

Man, that's messed up.

Man, I guess you gotta be somebody
to get up in there, man.

What you mean? We is somebody.

Hell, wait till they hear me rhyme.

Bitch asses.

Hey, now

How many niggas wanna play now?

Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

Nigga, say now, lay it down

Hey, hey, now
Hey, hey, hey

How many niggas
wanna play now?

Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

Whatcha, whatcha
gotta say now?

Nigga, say now, lay it down

My guns are big enough
to take your hood out

Swipe a coat, yo, bullets flyin'

Gotta move it like Travolta

Slide in a truck without a chauffeur

Million dollar signature

Two just to get me on a poster

These niggas didn't do it
like they s'posed ta

Claiming they soldiers, turn bitch

When I'm flamin' the toaster

Sorry, I don't care about your rap

Man, I got a tech that will

blow clouds of smoke through our flesh

Bring you a little closer to death

Razor blade clos to your neck

If you owe me a check

O.G.'s know me on the strip

And I'm smooth like Goldie with a chick

Ma, I'm Moby with the dick

Haters wanna blow me with a clip

Man, I got shorties that'll cut you

while they blowing you a kiss

I'm a breath of fresh air

The best this year

For you blind motherfuckers

I'ma make shit clear

Hey, now
Hey, hey, hey.

How many niggas wanna play now?

Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

Don't do it, don't do it.

Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

Nigga, say now, lay it down

Hey, hey, now
Hey, hey, hey.

How many niggas wanna play now?

Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

Nigga, say now, lay it down

It's over.

That man is gonna blow up.

What were we brought here for, fellas?

Come on, Michelle.
You gotta hear this.

I mean, that's hot.

What's this gotta do with me, man?

Well, Nate, you hear
that passion in his voice?

The way he, um, personalize it,

almost as if he's
directing it at someone?

That's what you need, man.

You guys write the songs for me.

What am I supposed to do about that?

Come on, come on, come on.
That's irrelevant, bro.

We're not in the business
of excuses here.

We're in the business of business.

And right now, Razor is
very good business, huh?

Fuck Razor.
That's it.

That's it.

That's the spirit. Fire back, literally.

I mean, no one's buying
your shit right now.

Literally, again.

What are you trying to encourage?

You want to stay in this game?

You gotta make some waves.

I mean, the people
gotta believe in you.

Fight back.

I mean, seriously, bro,

you've gotta have some fire.

You want some girls?

Is that it?

Or maybe he'd like some men.

Fuck you.

Very disrespectful, Jason.

Enough of this shit.
Man, I'm outta here.

Yo, Nem is a fake, a fugazi.

He's cheated his way to the top.

They say he struggled to live as a kid.

He hustled his way in.

The truth here, Mecca,

is that one of his
setup boys hooked him in.

Razor Ric, he's the talent behind it all.

Ice Cube behind N.W.A.

Nate ain't no thug.

He ain't even from the hood.

Razor's real.

He's from the dirt and the grind.

And so is his first track.

I mean it's hot.

Where you been hidin', Razor?

Damn, Miami's been dreamin' about you.

Fuck Nem. You the truth.

Hell, yeah, man.

He ain't nothin' but an old creep.

That's all he is.

Hey, man, so... Y'all remember
that bitch from the other night, right?

The one that done
hit me in the face?

Yeah, so I done got at her, man.

She done took me back to her place.

But I guess she forgot
what time her old man came home.

So I'm up in there, man.
I'm beatin' that thing.

Just...

And man, I done, I done seen something

move out the side of my eyes.

I done turned. I ain't see nothing.

Man, I look back forward.

She got them mirrors
up in the headrests.

You know what I'm talking about?

Man, I see old skinny white boy
coming with a golf stick, man.

Well, I done slid up
out that shit, dawg.

You know, I'm running around the room,
man. He chasing me, man.

My dick's swinging
back and forth and shit.

I'm trying to get to my pants,
'cause I got my five.

But I left the shit in my
pants. I got it wrapped up.

So I'm tryin' to squiggle
up under the bed and pull my pants

on account of that...
man, he done swollen up

like David Banner, dawg, and just...

Lift the bed. Threw the bed up.

So I done grabbed my pants,

and then I roll in the bathroom
and locked the door, man.

He beatin' on the door.
"Open this fucker!"

But man, I done got my fire.

Just as he open the door, I go "bum bum."

You know, what's up now?

Man, his whole expression changed.

I mean, he came through the door...

"Oh. Oh, listen, man.

"Listen, I don't want any problems or
anything, bro.

"You know, I don't
even care about her.

"I don't even love her."

And I'm thinking,
he got all nice and shit.

What if I... I would have
murdered his ass, dawg. I'm telling you.

You know you ain't never murdered
nobody in your life, man.

Let me tell you something.
And the only reason I ain't

murdered that motherfucker, dawg,

is because I ain't had no clothes on.

I'm saying, I ain't never
murdered without no clothes.

If you was butt-ass naked,
would you shoot somebody?

Just sayin', man. Dang.

What the fuck is this nigga
looking at, man?

Bitch-ass nigger!
What the fuck you lookin' at?

Yo! You don't know what
the fuck you looking at, man!

Yeah. Walking around with
his old lady's shirt on.

That light green, man.

He's looking like a Jolly Rancher.

Why don't you all
go home with that nonsense?

What? What the fuck...

Nigger, what you say?

What?

Get in the car, man. Come on.

Now what's the problem?
Y'all need to chill, bitch...

What's going on, man?

What you all doing over there?

Come on, man. Let that man go.

Come on, man.

What's going on, man?

Sure, Nem's a fake, a fugazi.

He's cheated his way to the top.

They say he struggled to live as a kid.

He hustled his way in,

that one of his setup boys hooked him in.

Razor Ric. He's the talent behind it all.

Ice Cube behind N.W.A.

Nate. Nate.

Yeah.

There's some white girl out there,
here for an interview?

She looks harmless.

All right. So, Nemesis.

They say you've been putting on an act.

Is it true?
That's right.

So it's right. You have been acting?

No, I... they have been saying that.

All right. Okay.
What do you got to say?

I got to say it's all false.

Ain't none of it true.
It's all been made up.

What, your image?
No, man. The accusations.

Accusations.

That's a pretty big word
for some street cat.

You sure you're not
in character right now?

Turn the camera off.

Look, man. I just want to get this...
Turn it off.

Look, I think this shit's hot...
Turn the camera off!

All right.

Turning it off.

Okay.

It's off.

What the hell are you
tryin' to do to me, huh?

Are you really angry,
or is this just an act, too?

Wha...

Look, man.

All I want to know
is what's more real, all right?

The people out there,
they're asking the same thing.

They want to know. You want
to set the record straight or not?

I just want to know
what's more real, okay?

You tell me. Nemesis or Nate?

Nemesis. Nemesis. Nate.

Oh, yeah. That's cute, right?
Nate. Nemesis.

Yeah, you know what's real, huh?
A white rapper chick!

Aw, Nemesis. You're
so cute when you smile!

Wait, you're frowning now. I like that.

Ain't nothing cute or sweet about me,
sweetheart. I'm all man, okay?

You're all man.
Razor sure don't seem to think so.

Well, fuck Razor!
I'll whup his ass and bang his groupies.

That's the first time
I believed you all day, soldier.

I ain't gonna lie.

It's kinda hot.

That's why you need me.
To bring out the real you.

It's the first time
I've seen you like that.

No holding back
is the only way to be

If you feel it, shout aloud

It's all about the beat

Yeah

I like that

Yes.

Hey, it's Michelle. Can I come in?

Yes, you can.

Come here.
What's up?

I have great news.
What's going on?

Capacity crowd for yet another show.

Oh, yeah. And I heard
they want to introduce you

to some guy named Ben Green.
Who is Ben Green?

I don't know. He's really shady.
Some kind of jerk.

But just ignore him.
Well, I can handle it.

Nate.
What?

Have you been smoking?

No.
No?

Have you been drinking?

Maybe just a little bit.

Drunk. Drunk.

Nate, you supposed to wait to get drunk.

At least let me go over
the assessment...

Don't you ever try that again.

Do you understand?

Are you serious?

You know, well, just go home, then.

Boring-ass trick.

Hey, Nem.

Michelle.

Always a pleasure.

All right. This is the situation.

All the public knows is that your
lifestyle is totally unaffected by all this.

So in order for you
to keep your lifestyle,

I'd like to introduce you
to my main man, Ben Green.

An expert that really gonna flaunt
your little bad boy creed, okay?

Ben? Okay.
Pleasure.

You guys go at it.

Listen, I got a lot of things
in store for you, my brother.

A lot of things.
Hi, Ben.

Ah. You must be Michelle, the manager.

Yeah.
Beautiful face.

What a fantastic job
you're doing, sweetheart.

This whole rivalry jive shit? That's hot.

Ben, we may have to go soon.

Wh... look. I tell you what.

What I have in mind...
We ain't finished yet.

Maybe you need to ride up out of here.

Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.

Stop speaking for me. I ain't no puppet.

Too many different niggas around here,
trying to call shots.

I can speak for myself.

You got beef with that?
What's wrong with you?

Are you just trying to show off?

T'ain't for no show, man.

Some order need to be
restored around here.

Now, you either sit quiet
or ride the fuck out.

Is this about last night, Nate?

Whatever, man.

You know what? You're on your own.

And forget you, too, clown.

I like her.

So anyhow, this is what
I have in mind for you, my friend.

We got a lot of things to do
and a short time to do it in.

You with me? I need your eyes.

What's going on, little man?

Ain't gonna be no little man.

The name's C. Dub, out of Streets 1-5.

Born and raised in the MIA.

Gangsta for life.

What you know about being gangsta?

Man, what you know?
You about to get smoked by Razor Ric.

He's nothing like
the rest of his classmates.

He was always distant from everybody,

but I had no idea that he...

Mr. Harris, I have never,
in my 11 years of teaching,

ever seen anything like...
What did he do?

Man, come on!
Sign the autograph, nigga!

Ain't nobody want your autograph anyway,

you bitch-ass nigga!

...soft sounds of Soul 94.

In news today, local rapper Nemesis
was the subject of a scandal

when he apparently refused
to sign a local boy's autograph.

The rightfully-outraged
crowd demanded he sign,

at which point Nemesis pulled out a gun.

A riot ensued, and Nemesis
quickly slipped out

under the protection of his bodyguards.

It's a shame that, in this day and age,

celebrities think they can
get away with anything.

Promise you, I'll tell you soon.

We'll know soon enough
where we're moving.

We will. Come on.

Lighten up.

It's not that.

Then what's wrong, chief?

If I could, I would have
fought back yesterday.

Nate, you're telling me
of all the places you can go,

if you can go back to anywhere in time,

you would go back to the day
that some bullies picked on you?

Yeah, and I would punch Billy Hubbard
right in his fat face.

Nate.

There was a reason you
didn't fight back yesterday.

A more important reason.

Like what?

Well...

I don't know.

Maybe you've got a supernatural power
that not even you know about.

Yeah, right. I'm a short, skinny wimp.

The same was said of
Clark Kent and Peter Parker.

But you know about them, don't you?

Yeah.
One day, your power will be discovered.

I'm sure it's in there.

The day you find out,

the whole world will be depending on you.

Think about that.

Man, this boy trippin'.

He ain't coming, man. I told y'all that.

Chronic. Smoke all you want.

Smoke up, baby.

Open the door, nigga.

Yo, open the fucking door,
you green-ass nigga.

That's my point exactly.

Roll the fuck-up, Dough Dough, man.

Gotta get back to the studio.

What up, Gunplay?
What, you gonna put down another track?

Something like that.

Oh, I'm jumping on that.

You say one song,
and I can get on with you.

Pone, Pone, Pone. Take it easy, man.

I told you I got you, right?

I told you I'll let you know.

It just don't work
like that all the time, man.

How exactly do it work, then, man?

You said, you know, I could
get on a track with you.

You know. You won't let your boys
in the studio with you.

Man, you the boss.
Hell what they talk about.

So I'm saying. What you saying, Pone?

I'm a puppet or something?

Huh? They run me?
Is that what you saying?

Man, all we trying to say is Nem
always let us get up in the studio.

And he was going in,
man, we putting out some beats.

Let Pone get a verse, you know.

That's right.

What I tell you about saying
his name around me, huh?

Chill out, man.
What I say, Gunplay?

I just saying.

Man, this gonna be some good shit.

Yo, man. Don't say that nigga name
in the same sentence as mine, all right?

Where Nem at now?

I don't seem him with
y'all punk-ass niggas.

Huh? Where Nem at now?

He hiding out in his fucking mansion
behind his bodyguards.

Why? 'Cause he know next time
he bump into Hell Razor,

death is certain, that's why.

Why you gettin' so defensive, Razor Ric?

I mean, for somebody so in control,

you sure getting a
little hot there, buddy.

Yo, Pone. You got something
you need to say to me, man?

You got something to get off your chest?

Then fucking say it, then, nigga!

You got something
you want to say to me, Pone?

I ain't trying to say nothing.

Maybe Nem ain't the
only poser around here.

Oh, yeah? Fuck you.

God damn, nigga!
Why you do that shit, nigga?

Fuck that! I'm callin' the shots now!

You get that?
I'm the head nigga in charge!

Hell Razor!

You a dead man walking, Pone.

You're a dead man walking, man.

You better have that
same fire in your pants

the next time I catch you, homeboy.

Take a look around, fellas.

Niggas.

Gangstas. Goons.

Whatever the fuck
y'all want to be called.

We soldiers over here. Y'all know this.

Why? Because shit,
we done struggled together.

Ever since I could remember, man,
we been running these streets.

And we all been running 'em together.

But a time come when
you look around, and...

you don't quite know where you is.

Maybe we're seeing things
through new eyes.

Maybe... we been blind till now.

We done witnessed
this whole Dade County

305 thing at its birth.

And if the right math ain't done,

we gonna witness the death of it.

They say...

that this is the heart
of Dade, right here.

And judging from the work
I done seen you all put in,

I know that's true.

But if that's so,

then this also is the heart of darkness.

Ain't no telling what's gonna go down
in the dark, man.

Ain't no way of knowing.

But I say

that the darkness can rise

when it get good
and goddamn ready to.

It's been a naive light, so to speak,

that done found us
way inside us, fellas.

And we ain't even
notice it till right now.

And we got to bury that light.

Within the dark.

This motherfucking Razor Ric.

This nigga from up north, man.

They don't know what to do
with us Dade County boys.

They don't know how to take us.

We're not Northerners.

We damn sure ain't Easterners.

We Southern boys. Son of slaves.

Migrated from Georgia, Mississippi,

Alabama, Louisiana, Texas.

We ain't no goddamn flodgers, man.

And we damn sure ain't
no motherfucking Razor Rics.

It's time to show the whole
motherfucking world

what us Dade County boys be about.

That's it. End of story. I say no more.

Hell, yeah!
My nigga! Let's go!

Why'd you come here
if you weren't gonna talk?

It's getting ugly.

But you knew that would happen going in.

That's the mentality of it.

They think it. They spew it.

And eventually, they act it out.

You live by it, you die by it.

I'm just playing the game.

Yes, but... But you're
caught up in it now.

You're in a bind.

And that's for real.

What was I supposed to do?

What, sit neutral
my whole life and get what?

You were raised differently.

You see the world in different colors,
your own colors.

You should have stayed in that world,
made a way out of it.

That's a real man.

Now you...

you're living by their rules.

You have to stand up for yourself
and mark your territory.

Can't believe what you said.

Can't you see
that tonight was a wake-up call?

You still have a chance
to climb out of it.

But you... you're acting
like you're brainwashed,

like a...

like a soldier.

You know, maybe I don't want to be
walked over my whole life.

Who got walked over?

Who?

You did, Pops.

Look, I don't want to be you.

Fucking peacenik.

Who walked over me?

Where are they now?

Where are they now?

I don't know you man

I'll open up your top like a soda can

Catch you with your girl in the park

While you holdin' hands

Hop up on the block

With a sword like I'm Conan

I'm the commissioner

Chump, you a visitor

When I pop the trunk

I leave 'em broke like a christening

And that's why you christeners hate

Whoa, hey! Hold on!

No!

You want to go to your place?

Go to your place.

Back to my place?

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

Is that cool with you?

It's fine.

Some hot shit comin' out of the 305.

That was the world premiere of
True Thing Boy Pone

and his single, "Dane County Streets."

Hot.

Now speakin' of hot 305, boys,

word just came in that Razor Ric is in
good condition and quickly recovering

from a gunman's attack
earlier this morning.

Look, it's all part of a plan.

It's...

What plan? Razor got shot.

Yes, Pone was supposed to attack him,
but not shoot him.

Razor is your meal ticket, guys.

He needs to be shooting people,
not getting shot.

It was intentional. Come on...

Look, that's the only thing that...

Exactly what we needed
to tip him overboard.

Because I haven't heard him do shit yet.

He's all talk, but hey,
I guess that's better

than your other gangster rapper, Nemesis.

Where's his retaliation song, guys?

You can't even have him
fight back in words.

We figured it would
be better for his image.

Hey, Stan?
Yeah?

Shut the fuck up.
No.

She's setting him up
for a rape charge.

That'll look real gangster.

Raping a helpless white bitch...

Go fuck yourself, Stan.

I told you guys before to make a choice.

You don't need this pussy Nemesis.

He's just a pawn.

Remember, guys, Tupac versus Biggie?

When did they sell the most records?

After death.

Get rid of this Nemesis fucker.

Razor is your star.
You want to create a rap war,

it better be for real.

Be overt with these guys.

Challenge their ego.

and they'll pop anyone.

He almost got himself killed.

How the hell you gonna
let him walk around by himself?

Man, he ain't...
You're supposed to be his manager.

We give him to you for one day,

and this is what happens?

I thought you were supposed
to be a step up, guy.

We've been cultivating
these kid for two years.

And all the sudden,
this is what you're gonna do?

It's nothing serious.

It just grazed his left hip.

He thinks it's nothing
serious getting shot.

What the fuck are we gonna do now?

It's time to mellow out.

The media's gonna be all over him.

Uh, he does have a point.

The media is gonna be all over this.

That's true. You know what?

Get our lawyer.

And tell 'em, um,
we're gonna press some charges.

I could call Mike.
I'll tell him to bring a video here.

He could record all this.

And then we could send it
to Channel 7, all right?

This is gonna be great. Oh, my God,
I didn't even think about that, man.

This is gonna be really good.

Start taking some legal...
No.

No.

Look at this.

I'm holding court.

Now take your ass and this conversation
in the next room, man.

Sick of y'all yapping.

I'm taking action.

Go ahead, get the fuck out, man.
All right, Razor.

I got your legal action right here.

I'm the fucking judge.

God damn, you're such a lightweight.

A lightweight? I'm heavier than you are.

Oh, please. It's 'cause
your head's getting big.

My head, what about
the size of your head?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch it.

See, your head's so damn big,
you're about to fall over.

I know exactly what I'm doing.
My God.

Look, this is my house.

Right. Yeah.

And you know what,
you need to do something

about that Hennessey breath.

Hennessey breath?
Yeah.

Let's get you cleaned up.
What about your breath?

My breath is good.
No, no.

Fuck.

Help! Somebody help!

Come on. Come on.

Get inside. Get inside now.

Hey, come here. Come here.

How's that feel?

It's all right.

You're lucky they didn't
have weapons out there.

They lucky they snuck up from behind.

Razor's a fucking coward.
Please.

Please what?

Look, I'm just saying.

What, you got something to say?

I'm just saying...
Get this off me, man.

I'm just saying...
Look, you got something to say, say it.

You're acting like a gangster.
I am a rapper.

And what are you trying to prove?

Nothing, all right? It's just...

Well, Nem, who are you?

I'm Nemesis, right?

I'm Nemesis, and I'm about
to go fuck Razor up.

Why would Razor go in disguise?

And why would he have to?

'Cause he know if I see him
what I'll do to him.

Nem, come on, man.

Come on, we both know
that you're not a fighter.

Look, I've been fighting my whole life.

Not your nor the doubters
gonna take that away from me.

Get the fuck out of my house.
I'm trying to tell you something.

Get the fuck out of here.
I'm trying to tell you...

Get the fuck outta my house.
I'm trying to tell you something.

You know what, Snaps?
You get the fuck outta here, too.

I'm not gonna leave you unprotected.

This shit is over. Get the fuck out, man.

Got damn it, would you listen to me?

I said listen.
Everybody get the fuck out of my house.

God damn it. I said listen!

This shit is between me and Razor.

Nate, open the door, man.

Nate, open the door, man.

Nate, open this door, man.

Get down. Yeah, get down.

Get down. Get on the fucking ground!

Both of y'all.
Get on the fucking ground.

Yeah, what's up now?

Yeah, who's real now?

Who's real now?

What are you doing, Nate?

Oh, Nate, huh?

You ain't my dawg.
You my nemesis, right?

Turn the fuck over.

Yeah, I want to look right into your eyes
before I blow you away.

Where you going?

You hear that sound?

Police coming.

Nigga, I don't give a fuck about no cops.

Tell 'em to come.

I just want to watch you die slow.

What are you doing, Nate?

It's what you wanted, right?

You thought you had me.

But don't nobody have me.
You can't touch me.

I'm a fucking star.

You about to be my first hit.

But what it look like?

Why am I gonna feel
different when it's over?

Nate?

They set me up to hate you, man.

I bet it's just like
everything else, right?

They set Pone up to hate me, dawg.

We'll do it once,
and it just starts to flow from there.

They set Pearl up to
charge you with rape, Nate.

They're the liars here, Nate.

Not you, man.

This ain't so hard.

This is not how to
set this straight, man.

Everything's about to be set straight.

Tonight you become Nemesis,

the people's enemy.

Fight back.

You want to know who I am?

Who I really am?

You want the truth, nigga?
This is the truth!

Gangsta for life.

You about to get smoked by Razor Ric.

Gangsta for life.

The more you hate them,
the more they love you.

He's nothing like the rest
of his classmates.

He was always distant from everybody,

but I had no idea that he...

Mr. Harris,

I have never, in my 11 years of teaching,

ever seen anything like...
What did he do?

Your son's brilliance transcends him

far and away from this classroom.

Mr. Harris, children talk about being

astronauts and firemen
when they grow up.

Nate has created a hero,

Nemesis...

A loving and realistic portrait
of what he could be.

Nemesis, a man oft
under-appreciated by

the world around him,
but who in the end,

has the power to heal
the souls of our society.

Nemesis sees great potential

in himself, in his surroundings,

in this existence.

And his true lyrics and drawings,

they will bring out that inherent beauty.

It is up to him to
instill that in others.

What now, fellas?

I'm glad you guys are here.

I guess we have no business here.

Here's the door, guys.

You guys can leave anytime you want.

Hey, take it easy, tough guy.

How you gonna kick somebody out
who's already gone?

Our business here's done, anyway.

Oh, is that right?

That's right.

That's funny 'cause I thought you guys
actually still had a contract with us.

Oh, a contract.

Yeah, you want to check it out? Go ahead.

I think this needs to be reworked.

Oh, look.

Growing some balls, there, baby.

That's the way.
Hey, shut up, man.

Shut your mouth.

Now, you got something
else you need to say, man?

Ah, the problem is, guys,

I wish you guys could
learn some common sense.

See, you guys are talented artists.

A whole lotta money to be made.

We could've made it together.

I guess you guys gonna
have to make it for us.

You see, you guys can't just leave

whenever your little
heart desires, you see?

You're committed to us
for the next five years,

so whatever money you make,
you gotta give us 15%.

So please, be a nice little ho
and get us some money.

You know, you need to
start your own new label,

Sellout Entertainment.

How you gonna do your
brothas like that, anyway?

I thought I was supposed
to be the house nigga.

Oh, my brothas.

So I'm supposed to keep it real, right?

I'm supposed to keep it street?

Razor Ric?

Come on, man.

When you guys ever gonna learn
what's really important?

You been hanging around this cracker
way too long, man.

Yeah, we outta here.

Take a rain check.

Well, you guys have a good day.

Take care of the check.

But remember this, fellas.

Hip hop ain't black and white anymore.

It's green.

Yeah, it's D.J. Mecca, aka Grimore,
the host with the most from coast to coast.

We at the reunion. Y'all about to see
a special performance right now.

Two brothas that were together,

that separated and were
at each other's throats.

Now you about to see
the reunion go down.

Dade County's finest,

Nemesis, Razor Ric. Y'all stay tuned.

It's coming up right now, baby.

Hey, playa.

Michelle, what are you doing here?

You excited?

Yeah, I'm excited.

I mean, it's a small crowd,

but you gotta start somewhere, right?

Start from the ground
and build up.

And I'ma do it right this time.

Slowly but surely.
Yeah.

You lightened up a lot.

Yeah, I'm trying.

Listen, I want you to sign on

as my manager again.
I'm sorry about what...

Nate. Don't even go there.

Besides, how can I
sign on as your manager,

especially when I never left?

That's what I'm talk...
Ain't this sweet?

Let's go, man. It's show time.

Let's get up outta here.

Razor, can you get outta here
while I talk to my client?

Man, stop trippin'.

Hey, so what was it you wanted again?

Why you gotta throw that on me...

Just go out there,

say what you mean,

and do it like you mean it.

Oh, wait. Lip gloss.

Okay, go get 'em.
It's all gloss.

Yeah, it's your boy Nemesis.

This is motivational music, man.

This for anybody that's
ever been through anything.

Food for the soul, you understand?

Hell Razor, where you at?

I'm dealing with inspiration over here.

305, stand up.

Come on. Look. Listen.

I gotta be me

'Cause that's the only life I know

But they don't really know me

They just like my flow

They tryin' to change me
into something I'm not

But I ain't tryin' to be a fake

Just to get to the top

Mad love for my pops
for showing me the way

He's the reason I can
stand as a man today

Yeah, I've been through it all

Seen a lot of nonsense

A lotta broken dreams

A lotta empty promises

Look to the sky,
I gotta keep my head high

Shoot for the stars, if I miss

Get another try

All my life, I waited on the sideline

Learnin' the game,
tryin' to respect the guidelines

A cold world, so many fake friends

Plottin' on your end
when the jealousy sets in

But you can't
let it break you down

Be yourself, don't let
nobody take you down

Come on. Yeah.

Just let me do my own thing, man.

That's it.

Now put your hands together.

Hell Razor, where you at?

Hell Razor, where you at?

Hell Razor.

It's what we go through, man.

Let's go.

Everybody got a dream

The problem is sellin' it

We all got a story

The problem is tellin' it

The industry is a pool of sharks

Hard to see, 'cause most of 'em

Move in the dark

But I can't sell my soul, hell no

So, I stay on the grind,
rain, sleet, hail, snow

Caught up in the grind,
get blinded by the bright lights

Man, every day,
it's like rollin' the dice

I gotta buckle down
and take control of my life

And recognize these snakes
before they even got to strike

I'm here for the fight,
down for the cause

They ain't wanna let me in

So I kicked down the door

Music is life, I represent all of that

Hip hop's the culture,
and yeah, I'm a part of that

Love who you are

Don't ever let 'em change that

Gotta stay true

That's the way to get the game back

Come on, man.

I'm the one.

Nemesis.

Gotta feel me.

Hell Razor.

It's what we go through, man.

Come on, yeah.

Let's try to talk to 'em, man.

Put your hands together, man.

This is feel-good music.

For you and you.

You over there.
