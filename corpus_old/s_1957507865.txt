              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

        ["the first day"
      by todd carey plays]

    â™ª this is the first day â™ª

  â™ª of the rest of your life â™ª

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         â™ª your head was
       in the worst way â™ª

    â™ª so you cast it aside â™ª

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   â™ª open up your window... â™ª

           [cheering]

    â™ª breathe in the air... â™ª

    [woman] congratulations!

              Aww.

        -Earth to avery.
      -Are you ready to go?

             Sorry.

   Who doesn't love a wedding?
 And, oh, that one was so sweet.

   But we are in san francisco
           to antique,

     not to catch bouquets.

  Which I never catch, anyway.

  â™ª ...Dare deny something... â™ª

      okay, I know your mom
     was a wedding planner,

 so you come by this naturally,

 but your affinity for weddings

      is just a little bit
          over the top.

      Well, "over the top"
  isn't such a bad place to be

    when it comes to romance.

     Mm. Not very practical,

        but very likable.

        I'll second that.

  Oh, I miss you guys so much.

   I know. One weekend a year
    is definitely not enough.

       Not nearly enough.
    There is so much to say.

       Care to elaborate?

              Uh...

       Do you want to talk
   about your break-up, or...?

        I'd rather shop.

      Okay, then we will go
    straight from "concerned"

           to dessert.

              Yes.

 So does anybody have any ideas

       of where we should
       meet up next year?

 I was thinking about savannah.

    The south is so beautiful

      and it is a goldmine
    for incredible antiques.

      Actually, I might be
       in Italy next year,

   if the university approves
     my art history program.

       -[cell phone rings]
  -which, of course, they will.

   -Yeah. Of course they will.
    -[keyboard being tapped]

         uh, excuse me.

    I'm not sure, but I think
    that looks like a phone.

    Okay, okay, I'm so sorry!

           But I have
     that auction coming up,

       so I told my office
       they could text me.

         It'll be quick!

        All right, fine.

         She's gonna be
    running that place soon.

       Of course she will.
         You know what?

      I love that we're all
 coming up the ladder together.

         You're gonna be
    head of your department.

     I'm hopefully gonna be
  a full curator at the museum.

        How's that going?

     Well, the competition's
         pretty serious.

    Jason's a real go-getter.

 Well, then you get there first.

           Ah, I wish
     I had your confidence.

         We're available
        for cheerleading,

      if you ever need us.

     You guys are the best.

  What would I do without you?

       To being together.

         You know what?
   To rooting for each other.

          Here's to us.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             -right?
            -I know!

      [indistinct exchange
          and laughter]

  well, do you think we should
 find out what hilda is hiding?

         Oh, let's see.

              Okay.

         Good afternoon.

           Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

 Yeah, your store is beautiful.

         Ah, thank you.

      Are you ladies local?

       Or are you visiting
        from out of town?

         I'm from boston

     and emma's from chicago

  and tracy lives in new york.

       Ah. Are you looking
   for anything in particular?

         Oh, I just love
        antique jewelry--

    as you can probably tell.

               Mm.

     Is that a wedding veil?

    Would you like to see it?

  Well, I'm not in the market,
            but I...

       I'd love to see it.

        Well, this isn't
        an ordinary veil.

     It's quite enchanting.

            Oh, wow.

     This is unlike anything
    I have ever seen before.

      You'll probably never
   see anything like it again.

          It's italian,
   from the late-19th century,

     and entirely handmade.

     It really is stunning.

        The craftsmanship
        is so detailed--

           it's almost
       like a work of art.

           [gasps] oh.

    Look at the little heart.

          Look at that.

         It's so sweet.

             [hilda]
 are any of you ladies engaged?

   Perhaps one of you would be
  interested in purchasing it?

    Oh, well, you're the one
        with a boyfriend.

       -What do you think?
           -Oh... Heh.

      Finn and I are happy
           as we are.

     I feel that would send
       the wrong message.

         You should know

        there's a legend
    that surrounds the veil.

       Really? I'll bite.

     Whoever's in possession
           of the veil

      will find true love.

            -[scoffs]
           -true love?

         [hilda] mm-hmm.

  Okay. That's my kinda legend.
          Tell me more.

           -[laughing]
  -romance is her middle name.

           [chuckles]
  well, my mother had the veil,

        and it came to me
         and my sisters,

 and we're all happily married.

           [laughing]

      I don't believe this.

       Emma, look at this.

   There's a little "a" on it.

          What? Where?

    Look, on the underside--
   there's an embroidered "a".

        "a" for "avery".

      It was meant for you.
       You have to buy it.

           It's yours.
          It's for you.

          Okay, I know
  this seems completely crazy.

    I don't have a boyfriend,

          I definitely
   don't have a fiancÃ©, but...

       I'd like to buy it.

    Do you take credit cards?

     Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

          Uh, let us--
     let us buy it for you.

              -No!
 -Like a premature wedding gift.

         No. Wait, guys.

   You know what we should do?

   We should buy it together,

      and we should pass it
         to one another,

   in keeping with the legend.

      Oh, that's beautiful.

         "something old,
        something new..."

       something borrowed
       that's gonna bring

    someone or something new
         into our lives.

         Does this thing
     come with a guarantee?

         [hilda laughs]

   well, only time will tell.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           all right.
        Well, this is it.

            What time
     does your flight leave?

       Not until tonight.

 I figured I'd go check out some
  of the sights that we missed.

           Wait, wait.

            You guys,
 the light is really good here.

  Can we take one last picture

           before we--

          -she's ready.
      -You know me so well.

              Okay.

        I should by now.

              Um...

           -All right.
           -All right.

   Wait. Can you see the veil?

          I can see it.

       There we go. One...

           Two, three!

             [snap]

      aw, we look so happy.

    Oh. Just like in college.

             [tracy]
    except with better hair.

 Are you talking about my bangs?

  Your "mall bangs," you mean?
          Those bangs?

      Do you guys remember
 the very first selfie we took,

           in front of
 that old house that we rented?

         Oh, that house
        was falling down.

  Yes! But we had so much fun.

     It's still standing...
        Just like we are.

           I love you.

        I love you, too.

       All right, this is
the part of the weekend I hate--

         saying goodbye.

       Calling and zooming
  can't compare to a real hug.

   These goodbyes last longer
        than the weekend.

 We have to get to the airport.

         -[laughs] okay.
           -All right.

    I miss you guys already.

    Well, maybe we'll see you
      at your wedding, huh?

             -Oh...
 -Your<i> two</i> maids of honor. Two!

         -I heard that!
              -Bye!

              Aww.

     Hi. I just checked out,

 but I was hoping I could leave
   my things here for the day?

           Of course.

     What a beautiful veil.

         -Oh, thank you.
   -I'll take good care of it.

       Thank you so much.

               Oh!

      Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

     I think this is my cab.

   Uh, pretty sure it's mine.

         -Based on what?
         -The fact that

        I held my arm out
  and the cab coming to a stop?

         How do you know
     he didn't stop for me?

    I have really long arms.

              Uh...

            [laughs]

       uh, you know what?

     Why don't you take it?

       Unless, of course,
   you think chivalry is dead.

      Very gallant of you.

          Gallant? Wow.

     Nobody's ever called me
        "gallant" before.

       Well, how many cabs
       have you given up?

       Clearly not enough.

           [chuckles]

           thank you.

           No problem.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

      guess we didn't need
       two cabs after all.

     [chuckles] I guess not.

        So, is this fate
         or coincidence?

          I don't know.

     I guess we'll find out.

           [chuckles]

  I thought I was the only one
who read the entire description.

        Yeah, no, I know.
  Some people find it annoying.

  Yeah, which is why I usually
      go to museums alone.

    I go alone. All the time.

            -Really?
             -Yeah.

        I mean, it's not
    that I don't have friends

      to go with, I just--

   you just want to keep 'em.

     [laughs] yeah, exactly.

              Uh...

         Hey. You, uh..
  Do you have any plans after--

           after this?

    What'd you have in mind?

      Well, I was planning
     on smelling the roses.

         Wait. I thought
  you were being philosophical,

     but you literally just
   wanted to smell the roses?

 Yeah. I'm a literal kinda guy.

         -Good to know.
       -Why don't you try?

              Okay.

            Mm. Nice.

              So...

 You wanna call this "fate" yet?

        I say we go with,
     you know, "coincidence"

      and see how it goes.

            Ah. Okay.

  Well, we have cabs, museums--

              -yes.
             -Roses.

 What else do we have in common?

       Walks in the rain?

   If I have an umbrella, yes.

          Cats or dogs?

              Oh...

       No, I can't choose.
        I like 'em both.

        Oh, extra points
        for that answer.

   All right. Favorite movie.

     <i> When harry met sally.</i>

   And this is a deal-breaker,
      if you don't like it.

  I watch that movie every day.

           [laughing]

     so, um, what brings you
        to san francisco?

   A reunion with two friends
          from college.

       We meet once a year

        and go antiquing
      in a different city.

         What about you?
  Why are you in san francisco?

           A wedding.

  Oh, the wedding at the hotel?

      Yeah. Yeah, I thought

        I'd stick around
    and do a bit sightseeing.

      I'm glad that I did.

  So you don't have to be back
  at work early in the morning?

          No. I kind of
       make my own hours.

         Oh, lucky you.

    So you're self-employed?

           Yeah. Well,
    it's something like that.

      Are you gonna make me
       guess what you do?

      No, why don't I guess
          what you do?

        Oh, so secretive.
         Are you a spy?

       No, I'm not a spy.

     Yep. I knew it. A spy.

         A spy who likes
       to smell the roses.

         Are you hungry?

        Me, I'm starving.

          I could eat.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           [avery] mm.

     Okay, this is so good.

   Yeah. You can really taste,

 like, the nutmeg and the cumin
    and that gruyere cheese.

         Mm-hmm. I think
   you just tipped your hand.

         You're a chef.

          [laughs] no.

      You're a food critic?

       Only when it comes
       to mac and cheese.

    There's a place in boston
            I go to--

         it's got, like,
      21 different flavors.

       I've tried 'em all.

              What?

       You live in boston?

        Born and raised.

        I live in boston.

              Okay.

     I think that it's time
  that we called this fate now.

            Maybe so.

  There's no "maybe" about it.

           Maybe not.

           All right.

           It's fate.

 I had a really nice time today.

          Yeah. Me too.
  I'm so glad you stole my cab.

            So am I.

          So we, uh...
  We'll pick this up in boston?

     All the mac and cheese
          you can eat.

       I would love that.

          [phone rings]

       oh, I gotta-- sor--
       I gotta take this.

           Oh. C.I.A.

      [as michael corleone]
   just when I think I'm out,

      they pull me back in!

           [chuckles]

 hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

       Oh. Perfect timing.
       Thank you so much.

     I'd love to have a veil
         just like this

       when I get married.

           Thank you.
       It's one of a kind.

       And I feel so lucky
        to have found it.

     [concierge] do you have
       a dress picked out?

        Uh, no, the veil
 is all I can handle right now.

 [concierge] well, you're going
   to make a beautiful bride.

        Oh, I'm actually
      not getting married,

       I just-- I saw it,

      it was so beautiful,
       I couldn't resist.

     -Well, it is beautiful.
           -Thank you.

    Can you take that for us?

           Thank you.

        Hey, so, do you--

   do you want to share a cab
   back to the airport, or...?

      Uh, no. I don't think
   that would be appropriate.

            Why not?

       Um... I gotta pack.

       Have a nice flight.

        Nice meeting you.

       [exhales, stunned]

            I thought
    that was your boyfriend.

  No. I don't have a boyfriend
         and... [sighs]

          ...If I did,
       it wouldn't be him.

       [avery] hey, emma.

           [emma]<i> hey.</i>
      <i> I got your message.</i>

        <i> Everything okay?</i>

    Yeah, I'm fine. You know.

      I just wanted to call
         and touch base.

  Well, I'm in between classes,

        so I've got time
     for a couple of bases.

 San francisco was so much fun,
       but you know what?

   It really got me thinking.

      I know what you mean.

   Every time we get together,
I start taking stock of my life.

            You know,
    where I was when we met,

        where I'm going.

     [chuckles] my thoughts
  were a little less profound.

         <i> [laughs] okay.</i>

    So, after you guys left,

          <i> I met a guy.</i>

              What?

 <i> Do you think it was the veil?</i>

       No. It was a bust.

               Oh!

       <i> How could I get it</i>

            so wrong?

  He seemed so nice at first--

         he was so funny
     and witty and charming.

        <i> Very attractive.</i>

    You know, that's exactly
          what you said

 about your last two boyfriends,
             right?

  I guess I've gotta get rid of
   these rose-colored glasses.

      <i> [laughs] no. Just...</i>
           <i> You know--</i>

    learn from your mistakes.

  Every relationship that fails
  is just an opportunity for us

  to know more about ourselves
     and what we want and...

      Oh, who am I kidding?

 Even my overly-protected heart
 is just gonna do its own thing.

            [laughs]

     all right, we can cover
     the other bases later.

      <i> Go teach your class.</i>

           Okay. Bye.

            <i> Goodbye.</i>

         Morning, jason.

            Morning.

          Hey! Mornin'.

             [thump]

    sorry to dump this on you
      your first day back.

        What is all this?

  Well, since you're heading up
       the gala this year,

          sonya thought
      it would be "helpful"

 if you looked through the files
      from previous years.

   Oh. This is quite a stack.

   They were pretty big galas.

    And if you pull this off,

        you're gonna get
         the promotion.

           This is how
  you prove yourself to sonya.

  And what extraordinary feats

          do you think
   jason will have to perform?

        I'm sure he's got
   a few feats up his sleeve.

              Hmm.

  -That didn't come out right--
           -[laughing]

   ...But you know how he is.

      Oh! I forgot to ask.

       How was your trip?

      It was best of times,

    it was the most confusing
            of times,

    but it was pretty great.

      How was your weekend?

        What did you do?
            [gasping]

       jeff proposed to me
in the middle of a celtics game.

 [squeals] ah! Oh, my goodness.

      I'm so happy for you!

        Oh, look at this.

       This is beautiful.
   Okay, we have to celebrate.

         Do you wanna do
       drinks after work?

          Yes! Perfect.

             Jason.

              Lucy.

       [sonya] uh, jason?

        What's the status
   of your children's program?

    Several elementary school
 classes have already signed up.

         And I was able
     to book charles palmer

           from n.Y.U.

       For the first talk.

   He's aware all the students
        are all under 12?

    I chose professor palmer

       because he created
          a successful

     interactive art program
      specifically tailored

          to pre-teens.

         Sounds perfect.

    I also wanted to announce

      that the president of
 the hastings family foundation

   will be joining our board.

         The foundation
     has primarily supported

      science and research
          non-profits,

        but mr. Hastings
  wants to become more involved

      in the art community
         and the museum.

 Mr. Hastings has hosted several
    galas for his foundation.

  He's offered us his services

        and I'd like you
        to work with him.

           Absolutely.
      I look forward to it.

         Unless someone
      has anything else...

       I think we're good.

    I would like to email you

        some ideas I have
        for new projects.

    Great. I'll take a look.

     That guy is relentless.

  Well, it seems to be working.

      So have you and jeff
           set a date?

           Next month.

         Wh-- I'm sorry.

   It's really loud out here.
  Did you just say next month?

          Yes, I know,
  I know what you're thinking.

          It seems like
   we're rushing into things,

        but I don't want
     to wait another minute.

     The sooner, the better.
           I love it.

              Good.

 Because there's so much to do.

      Okay, my brother said
       he would pitch in,

 and my mom's not gonna be here
  until the day of the wedding,

   so I really need your help.

          Well, this is
     the easiest ask ever--

    weddings are in my genes.

            I figured
    you would know what to do

      and I don't even know
         where to begin.

  Are you sure you don't mind?

     I'm running out of ways
           to say yes!

           Thank you.

          Yes! Cheers!

    Cheers. Now I can relax.

        Congratulations.

           Thank you.

  Yeah, this is gonna be great.

        Okay, maybe just
 a few more inches to the left?

            Perfect.

      All right, you guys,
   I have to get to a meeting,

          so I'll have
      to finish this later,

   but this is looking great.

  The stanbridge is so grateful
   to have your participation.

          [door opens]

             avery!

          I'd like you
     to meet peter hastings.

 Peter will be working with you
          on the gala.

         [phone ringing]

           uh... Lucy.

      Hi, I'm in a meeting.

          Oh! Oh, okay.
      I'll be right there.

       The henri rousseau
   that's on loan from the met

          just arrived.

        I'm the only one
      who can sign for it.

         Yeah, you can't
      keep the met waiting.

       No. Certainly not.

       I'll be right back.

        In the meantime,
   you two can get acquainted.

       What are the odds?

       Oh, don't you dare
      bring fate into this.

    W-why didn't you tell me
 who you were when we first met?

        It tends to color
   people's impression of me.

 Oh, no, my impression of you is
  that you were very secretive,

  and, ha, that hasn't changed.

      I never lied to you.
            I just...

     Left a few things out.

           Yeah, like
    what you do for a living?

        "philanthropist"?
Sounds a bit stuffy, doesn't it?

   Besides, it's not who I am.

   Oh, yeah, no, 'cause you're
  the guy who smells the roses

       and enjoys 20 kinds
       of mac and cheese.

 21... Kinds of mac and cheese.

   Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

             [sonya]
 I hope I didn't miss anything.

      No. W-we were just--

      we were just getting
      to know one another.

           If one can

       truly know anybody
   in a short amount of time.

     Apparently not as well
         as you'd think.

   I'm afraid you've lost me.

       We were just saying

        "how do you know
  if you really know someone?"

      you know? [chuckles]

            exactly!

       At least you're on
     the same wavelength...

   ...Whatever that might be.

              Um...

          Let's go over
   some of the preliminaries.

           Absolutely.
    So there are some things

    that need to be finalized
     in the next few weeks--

         like, a theme,

     and, uh, catering and--

   can I assume that the gala

     is going to take place
         at the museum?

          Well, unless
     you have a better idea?

       I just find museums
          can be, uh...

         A bit confusing
        for some people.

        [avery] even one
    you might want to forget.

    [both chuckling, forced]

        where do you want
        to have the gala?

             I think
     we should have it here.

             Me too.

          Okay, great.
       We agree. We agree.

        [peter] we agree.

         Totally agree.

        I'm glad we've...
      Got that worked out.

              Yeah.

             Me too.

    You know that girl I met
        in san francisco?

 Yeah, the one you really liked?

          Yeah, the one
     that forgot to mention

  that she was getting married.

   [chuckles] what about her?

        Well, I just had
    a meeting at stanbridge.

          It turns out
     that she's the curator

       I'm be working with
          on the gala.

           Seriously?

        Ooh. That must've
       been uncomfortable.

  Yeah, and she seemed to imply

       that I was the one
     that was in the wrong.

  So, is it gonna be a problem
        working with her?

    No. No, I've been wanting

   to do something outside of
   the foundation for a while.

            You know,
    get more involved in art,

      so I'm just-- I'm not
     gonna let it bother me.

  You mean let her bother you.

  We're two strangers who spent
 a little bit of time together.

   We hardly know each other.

 Besides, she's getting married.
       End of discussion.

       Hey, you're the one
   that keeps bringing her up.

   [emma]<i> so the guy you'll be</i>
  <i> working with is the same guy</i>

    you met in san francisco?

        That's hilarious.

  Yeah, well, neither one of us
           thought so.

      I was hoping the veil
  had better judgment than me.

 That is putting a lot of faith
     in some bedazzled lace.

           Oh, I think
      you guys were right.

       Hilda oversold it.

       <i> So who's the guy?</i>

         Peter hastings.

 He runs his family's foundation
         here in boston.

   He's one of<i> those</i> hastings?

         [avery]<i> uh-huh.</i>

         The university
       has a research lab

  with his family's name on it.

    [tracy]<i> didn't you google</i>
           <i> this guy?</i>

             Well--

    his father started one of
   the first biotech companies

         in the country.

   <i> Well, his father should've</i>
 <i> taught his son better manners.</i>

       <i> I mean, you don't</i>
        <i> run into a woman</i>

      <i> and call it "fate,"</i>

<i>and then just hop on an elevator</i>
<i>with a lame, "nice meeting you."</i>

             -oh...
          <i> -Seriously?</i>

              Yeah.

     It's too bad you can't
    google a guy's sincerity.

     Ah, that's what I like
           about finn.

        He is a good guy,

        <i> he's dependable,</i>

          and he never
     throws me a curveballs.

      Mm. Who're you trying
          to convince?

         <i> No convincing.</i>

    <i> A little compromising...</i>

<i>Gotta lean in to meet each other</i>
        <i> halfway, right?</i>

        Okay. Fair point.

        Oh, I should go.

       Tomorrow's gonna be
    a really complicated day.

      <i> Focus on the prize--</i>

       <i> and the promotion.</i>

     Yeah. No, I'll be fine.

     I just have to get over
        the embarrassment

      of seeing him again.

  <i> Okay, talk to you guys soon.</i>

            [smooch]
            goodbye.

 Maybe true love doesn't exist.

    Yeah, I like the length.

       What do you think?

             [gasps]

        oh, look at you.
    That dress is perfection.

     Do you really think so?

       Yes. It's bad luck
       to lie to a bride.

           Oh! Oh, oh.
        That is very you.

           You think?

 Kind of thought it would match
     the antique veil I got.

           Which is...
     Which is hard to match.

    Maybe I'm hard to match.

          You are not.

   I've been to more weddings
        than I can count

        and I have never
       caught the bouquet.

      Well, maybe your luck
       is about to change.

              Hmm.

      I have very good aim.

 All right, what's our next stop
           after this?

       Okay, we have a few
      cake-tastings to do,

         but... [sighs]

          I'm not sure
  we're gonna have enough time.

     I don't want to take up
     your whole lunch break.

          What's better
  than wedding cake for lunch?

        And I don't have
     to be back until 2:00.

        I have a meeting
      with peter hastings.

       Oh? What's he like?

      I mean, besides being
   handsome, rich, and single?

         Let's just say
      he runs hot and cold.

    Oh! Oh, this is so good.

  I'll have what she's having.

       Is it 2:00 already?

      No, the board meeting
         got out early.

       Well, we're tasting
         wedding cakes.

            Join us.

          Have a piece?

             Or six.

    Actually, we could really
      use a man's opinion.

      What about the groom?

      Oh, he's out of town.

          Okay. Um...?

         -Try that one.
           -This one?

      Oh, it's too lemony.

     Well, it's lemon cake.

        Try the coconut.

             -Maybe.
           -All right.

    Try the chocolate mocha.
         I can't decide.

       That's the winner.

          Right there.

       Guys always go for
         the chocolate.

      We're interchangeable
             to you?

     When it comes to cake,
            you are.

       [cell phone chimes]

        I gotta check out
        the installation.

       I'll be right back.

  So, um, when is the wedding?

           Four weeks.

       -[fork hits table]
      -can you believe it?

       Wow! That's, um...

          That's soon.

       You're telling me!

    Uh, can you do me a favor

     and just let avery know
     just to meet me inside?

     Oh, but you're not done
           your cake.

     Uh, I lost my appetite.

        [avery] perfect.
           Thank you.

       You are so right--

    he does run hot and cold.

              See?

              Yeah.

             [avery]
  okay, so you're gonna get me

your foundation's list of donors

         and then I will
  cross-reference it with ours.

  Attendance tends to increase
   when the gala has a theme.

            Oh, true.

 The more fun people are having,
    the bigger the donations.

   Mm-hmm. Yeah, we could do,
         uh, mardi gras?

  Everybody loves a masquerade.

   Yeah, it's fun to dress up
 and pretend to be someone else,

  but we have done that before.

   [pointedly] well, you have.

        [confused] okay.

         What about a...
    What about a magic theme?

     You know, we could have
        magicians around,

       performing tricks,

          and you could
    volunteer to disappear--

            [mutters]
  ...Since you're good at that.

      Only when I feel like
     I don't have a choice.

        I'm... Gonna have
        to wrap this up.

             Sure...

      You've got a busy day
      of planning a wedding

      and planning a gala.

            Mm. Well,
     I'm a good multitasker.

           Obviously.

          Don't forget
   to get me your list, okay?

              Okay.

      Oh, this looks great.

 But something about this bench
       is kind of generic,

   it kind of ruins the mood.

   What did you have in mind?

    I just want the visitors
       to sit on something

   that reflects the exhibit,
            you know?

      There's some benches
        in the basement.

     We can get it tomorrow?

    We're about to clock out.

       I'll go down there
        and take a look.

   Have a good evening, guys.

         [panel beeping]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             [gasps]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         whoa! Whoa-ho.
        What's the hurry?

      Have you seen sonya?

       The security guard
       said she just left.

 I just saw her drive off, yeah.

         [sighs heavily]

    what are you doing here?

         I left my phone
     in the conference room.

 I think I just stumbled across
   a very important painting.

           Come look.

  This better be a masterpiece.

  Oh, it's hard to be certain,
  it's in such poor condition,

             but...

 I think it's by claudio amici.

    The 19th-century painter?

           Impressive.

        I've seen some of
  his paintings at the louvre.

  Yeah, I saw one at the getty.

       It's not unheard of
       for museums to find

  long-forgotten pieces of art.

     This would-- this would
  actually bring a lot of press

         to the museum.

    Yeah, if it's authentic.

  So I'm gonna do some research

   and see if I can figure out
       where it came from.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

 two heads are better than one.

           -[chuckles]
         -board member.

        Vested interest.

 I'm just as curious as you are.

           All right.

          Wow. You must
      really like van gogh.

       I saw this painting
         when I was 12.

     It was my first real...
     "wow" moment over art.

   I remember my first "wow".

     Was, um... Well, it was
      the western artists.

   My father was a collector,

       so he introduced me
 to thomas moran and remington.

           [chuckles]

  those paintings made me want
to be a cowboy when I was a kid.

   Well, it's never too late.

   All you need is the horse.

         I, um, I think
       I found something.

       There's a painting
      that's listed here...

            By amici,
 uh, the<i> ritratto di una sposa.</i>

     "portrait of a bride."

    what, you speak italian?

      I speak italian art.

           Let's see.

     "portait of a bride..."

    okay, so it's showing up
        in our database,

 but it's not listed as missing.

        [papers rustling]

             it says
   it was gifted to the museum

 by a private collector in 1963,

           but there's
      no other information.

   I mean, every piece of art

    is supposed to be tagged
         and catalogued.

         You know what?
         I have a hunch.

      The museum underwent
    some renovations in 1963,

         and they built
  a new off-site storage vault

        for the artwork.

            So, what?

    You think that they left
        the amici behind?

 Well, if it came to the museum
     during the renovation,

       I mean, there were
     no computers back then.

Everything was entered manually.

       It could've slipped
       through the cracks.

       [chuckles quietly]

    this would be... [laughs]

          this would be
        a huge discovery.

              Yeah!

           I'm so glad
      you let me in on it.

            So am I.

     We just got the report.

        Our experts have
    authenticated the amici.

         Really? [gasps]

 thank you for letting me know.

     Everyone seems to agree
        with your theory

   about how it was misplaced.

       Great work, avery.

           Thank you.

        This is amazing.

          So exciting.

              Wow.

     Con-- congratulations.

           Thank you.

       Yeah, it looks like
 the competition is heating up.

           It's really
    not a competition, jason.

   We're just doing our jobs.

     Yeah, well, pretty soon

          one of us...

     Will have a better job.

     And I'm not giving up.

          Neither am I.

       Don't let him step
         on your moment.

            I'm not.

      I mean, look at this.

              Wow.

       I gotta call peter.

  You see a picture of a bride
    and you wanna call peter?

       Peter? It's avery.

         Let's meet up.

              -Hi.
              -Hey.

   -Thanks so much for coming.
             -Yeah.

       -Of course. Thanks.
           -Of course.

       [cell phone chimes]

         oh. It's sonya.

           I told her
  that we were getting coffee.

      I think she's trying
        to figure us out.

     Yeah, well... So am I.

    Uh... Okay. So, my idea.

  I have an idea for the gala,

      and I know it's gonna
    sound a little ambitious,

             but...

        I was thinking--

   what if we unveil the amici
          at the gala?

  I don't know, that painting's
      in pretty bad shape.

        Yeah, but what if
    it was restored in time?

   I think it's a great idea.

But you're gonna have to present
    a proposal to the board.

       Oh, no, no, no, no.
   Not-- not-- not me. Sonya.

   I'm not a full curator yet,

  and associates don't usually
      go before the board.

         Are you hoping
   on becoming a full curator?

 Yeah, it's always been my goal.

            You know,
    my father had a saying--

        that you can wait
      for things to happen,

           or you can
   make thing happen yourself.

        Ugh, and what if
       they turn me down?

              Tch.

    I never thought of that.

             -But...
            -[laughs]

        there is one vote

 that you can probably count on.

     If we unveil the amici
          at the gala,

     it could bring a lot of
    attention to the museum.

         It could boost
     our fundraising efforts

   and people would get to see

          a work of art
   that's long been forgotten.

        Can you guarantee

        that the painting
    will be restored in time?

              I...

  If we announce the unveiling
 and the restoration isn't done,

         it would damage
    the museum's reputation.

      [avery] I understand,

       and I've consulted
     with frederick neumann,

  who's worked with the museum
          for 17 years,

     and he feels confident

   that he could have the work
      done by our deadline.

       I know it's a risk,

             but...

    It's a risk worth taking.

      "portrait of a bride"

      is an incredible work

          by an artist
 who deserves to be recognized.

    It's been in the basement
          long enough.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              so...

    The, uh, the board voted.

              And?

            In favor.

            -Really?
             -Yeah.

               Ah!

         [both laughing]

              uh...

          I... [laughs]

             -yeah.
         -Sorry. I--I...

              -No.
     -I just got so excited.

              Yeah.

         Wow. That's...

    That's all because you--
   you pushed me to go for it.

       Thank you for that.

         Well, I, um...

 I'll let you get back to work.

        [chuckles] okay.

     Hey, who do you think's
    gonna read that, anyways?

  I know two people who would.

              -Hi.
              -Hey.

  Well, peter's in a good mood.

       He's so wonderful,
      and then he's just...

     Like, all of a sudden,
       a different person.

       Maybe you can date
          half of him.

        There's an idea.

           [laughing]

          okay, listen.

     My brother wants to get
     the dj for the wedding,

           but we have
 very different taste in music.

        Mine being good,
        his, not so much.

          I didn't want
      to hurt his feelings,

          so I told him
      to consult with you.

       Well, I lean more,
       you know, romantic.

         Well, he leans
        more, like, loud.

          Don't worry.
       We'll work it out.

        The good news...

     Is the layers of grime
   seem to have protected it.

        And the bad news?

      The layers of grime.

           [chuckles]

   yeah, each one needs to be
      painstakingly cleaned

          before I even
      address the varnish.

       But it can be done
  in time for the gala, right?

  I set aside my other projects
    to make this a priority.

             It's...

        It's interesting
     how amici painted her.

        What do you mean?

      She seems awfully sad
         to be a bride.

    [peter] well, even though
        she looks sad...

    She is a beautiful bride.

            Mm. Yeah.
    All brides are beautiful.

      [frederick chuckles]

       thank you so much.

               Mm.

      I was just thinking--

     since this is gonna be
  the centerpiece of the gala,

       what if we made it
        a wedding theme?

      What, is one wedding
       not enough for you?

     Well, we're almost done
          planning it.

     Are you sure you're not
       taking on too much?

       The more weddings,
          the merrier!

    Plus, all the mocha cake
          you can eat.

            Oh, hey.
     I started without you.

         Oh, I just love
      planning weddings...

           Even though
   this isn't a real wedding.

        Well, I've never
      been married before,

 so I don't have any experience.

         I'm surprised.

        That I don't have
         any experience

    with wedding invitations?

          [laughs] no.
 That you've never been married.

           Well, I...

       I was engaged once.

      Yeah, we had a party
         and everything,

      but we didn't end up
       going the distance.

      What-- what happened?

        Uh... The, uh...

       The "hastings" name

and everything that's associated
      with it sometimes...

        It just makes me
        a bit suspicious

  of what somebody sees in me.

  That's why I, uh, I left out
          a few details

           when we met
        in san francisco.

            I just...

    I kinda liked just being
     the "gallant" stranger.

      But my, uh, fiancÃ©e,
           I realized,

  was in love with the details,
              so...

       ...We never made it
   to the wedding invitations.

   But, uh, this one's nice...

       And that one, too.

    Mm, no, it needs to look
       like an invitation

        to a 19th-century
        italian wedding.

              Oh...

              Yeah.

              That?

              Yeah.

       It's... Pfft, it's
 a bit ornate, don't you think?

              What?

           Yeah, um...

     Oh! How about this one?

  -Look at this. Look at that.
             -Oh...

    Hmm? Traditional. Subtle.

      Yeah. No, that looks
       like the invitation

to a 19th-century board meeting.

     It has to be romantic!

      This is our wedding--

          [words catch]

           ...G-gala.

           [stammers]
          the museum's.

 Um, it just needs to, you know,
 it needs to feel very romantic.

      You... You disagree?

      No, it's just, uh...

         Think you seem
        a bit flustered.

     No, I'm not flustered.

      I'm just-- this is me
       making a decision.

         Okay, now-- no.

             No, no.

               No.

           No, no, no.

               Oh.

         This is pretty.

  Yeah. This is really pretty.

     Yeah, it's very pretty.

           Very warm.

         For the gala--
         it looks, um...

        That looks good.

   It's a beautiful invitation
          for the gala.

          It's-it's...

   It's a nice... Invitation.

      I'm glad you like it.

  So you think this is the one?

           Yeah, I do.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           [chuckles]

   yeah, I guess you could say

   I've always loved anything
       that looks vintage.

        How long have you
   and your friends been doing

 these, uh, antiquing weekends?

       Since grad school.
      That's where we met.

         Wow, so, what,
          you're like--

  you're, like, kindred spirits
          or something?

    Yeah. I mean, yes and no,
             though.

        We're actually--
    we're all very different.

   We all see art differently.

         Tracy sells it
      at an auction house--

      defining its value--

        and then emma...

    Well, she analyzes art--
 its history, how it's evolved.

         How about you?

            I just...
   I just like to look at it,

     so I work in a museum.

           [chuckles]

        and we see, yeah,
     we see art differently,

       but not friendship.

       Those girls are...

  Oh, they're my ride-or-dies,
  and that's-- that's forever.

     So which one's gonna be
       your maid of honor?

     Well, trios are tricky,
        so we made a pact

     and promised each other

          to each have
      two maids of honors.

              Wow.

I was my friend drew's best man.

  But he didn't have a choice,
     you know, I'm his boss,

       and he doesn't have
       any other friends.

            [laughs]

      hey, wait a second--

  isn't that the place you were
 talking about in san francisco?

              Yeah.

   What? You-- you want to go?

           [avery] mm!

      Okay, the mexican mac
         is my favorite.

  Yeah? Try the mac and bacon.

     Okay, that is<i> so good.</i>

        -Right? So good.
      -That's unbelievable.

            You know,
   I used to come here a lot,

     then I ran out of time,

      because it turns out
     that giving away money

     is a full-time job, so.

    You're not what I thought
     a "hastings" would be.

    I mean, we're not exactly
          blue bloods.

            My father
     was a biotech engineer

      and when his company
       became successful,

  that's when he and my mother
     started the foundation.

   Yeah, he always believed in
  giving back to the community,

        funding research.

    And then it was my mother

             who had
  this strong family commitment

  and the importance of legacy.

         It sounds like
     they were a great team.

        Yeah, they were.

       And then, uh, well,
 two years ago, my father died.

     That's when I took over
         the foundation.

  It must be really gratifying

    to carry on the good work
        that he started.

      That's the best part
           of the job.

            In fact,

           on Friday,
     we are breaking ground

 on a new hospital for children.

         That's amazing.

          I don't know.
          It's like...

 This whole suit-and-tie thing,

           it's just--
       it's not who I am.

   I guess I just-- I'm afraid
     of letting people down.

     What does the real you
           want to do?

  Well, when I figure that out,

   you'll be the first person
             I tell.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           I feel like
      finding that painting

      was a turning point.

            You know?
   Like a sign, or something.

    I know that sounds silly.

 No, I think that sounds great.

           [chuckling]

          [man] avery!

             [avery]
    hey! I'll be right there.

  We have to go pick out a dj.

        Uh... Yeah. Yeah.

              Okay.

        [car door opens]

  [avery] this is so exciting!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

        lucy has no idea
  I'm booking the dj she likes

        for the wedding.

        Yeah, I told her
  you picked out some indie guy

         and I was gonna
       talk you out of it.

   You gotta keep it a secret.

    It's her wedding present
 and I want it to be a surprise.

       Oh, you know what?

      Every bride deserves
   to have a brother like you.

             Thanks.

      [seatbelts clicking]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              hey.

   I'm sorry, that took longer
        than I expected.

     -But we got a great dj.
         -That's great.

    You know, I was thinking,
    we should probably start

     talking about the music
          for the gala.

   You know what? Why don't--
   why don't you handle that?

          The unveiling
     and the wedding theme--

      those are your ideas,

       I think you should
        see 'em through.

         I'll just focus
         on the donors.

      Is... Is it just me,
  or are you always this moody?

        What do you mean?

          You're just--
  you're so warm and charming,

   and then, all of a sudden,
   you just-- you freeze over.

         I don't get it.

       Well, I don't know
        what to tell ya.

         I'm not exactly
       climate-controlled.

    Yeah. It doesn't matter.
     Never mind. Forget it.

     Look, I have a meeting
       at the foundation.

   -Can we pick this up later?
     -Yeah. Mm-hmm. 'course.

          Yeah, just...

             [sighs]

          good morning.

    Hey. How was your night?

         You know what,
     it was very productive.

 I've rearranged my priorities,

  and the gala and my promotion
      are front and center.

        I don't have time

   for a crush or some romance
    on an unpredictable man.

  Are you talking about peter?

      Yeah. Things have...

       Things have gotten
     very awkward between us

  and we have to work together.

             Oh, no.
      Did something happen?

         Let's just say
 he ran cold for the last time.

        I'm just over it.

     You don't seem over it.

        Well, it's okay.
         You know what?

   Maybe he's not comfortable
         getting close,

        or maybe he's not
      that attracted to me.

          I don't know.

  Or he's very attracted to you

      and he's pulling back
      because he's afraid.

      Okay, but either way,
      that still leaves us

       in the same place,
     which is... Is nowhere.

Can sonya give me a few minutes
  to discuss the kids' program?

       Yeah. I'll see what
      I can do about that.

          How are you?

    I'm great. Never better.

             Me too.

           Well, good.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          that's great.

          Peter! Peter?

              Hey.

      Have you had a chance
  to review the annual report?

            Oh, um...

     I'll-I'll do it later.

       I've got a meeting
         at the museum.

 I don't actually have a meeting
         at the museum.

    I just wanted to stop by
     and apologize to avery.

               Mm.

       Drew, I can't help
      how I feel about her.

    But I gotta get over it,

    because I like the museum
             and...

        And I really like
      working on the gala.

      Feels like I'm being
    more honest with myself,

    like I'm stepping out of
       my father's shadow.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           guess what?

        I just got a text
   from the business office--

      the gala is sold out!

              What?
 It never sells out this early!

             I know.

   Oh, I just want everything
    to be perfect, you know?

From the lighting to the food...

    I still have a few things
      to check off my list,

    so I'll be running around
          all day. Bye.

    Does sonya have any time?

          Oh. Um... No,
     she's jam-packed today,

     but maybe try tomorrow.

              Okay?

  I was just coming to see you.

             Did...

     Did we have a meeting?

               No.

      I wanted to apologize

     for being out of line.

             [sighs]

        you know, you...

      You really threw me.

     Listen, avery, I, uh...

     I-- I'd really like it
  if we could just be friends.

             Me too.

     Did you hear the gala's
        already sold out?

              -Wow!
             -Yeah.

      Well, what do you say
     we go show those donors

             a night
      they'll never forget?

          Let's do it.

      I was just on my way
         to the concert

      if you want to join.

          Lead the way.

          [phone rings]

        jason cartwright.

      Hi. Frederick neumann
   calling for avery morrison.

         She's not here.
      Can I take a message?

    I need to speak with her
      as soon as possible.

 It's about the amici painting.

           <i> All right.</i>

       I'll let her know.

           <i> Thank you.</i>

      [sets receiver down]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    [classical music playing]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       we should hire them
        for the wedding.

        And by "wedding,"
         you mean gala?

             Right.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    you, uh, you heading back
         to the museum?

     No. I left for the day.

         What about you,
    you have somewhere to be?

 Ah, I've got a business report
           to look at,

       but it's not really
         my strong suit,

      just part of the job.

     Now, that is something

        that I've always
      wanted to do, though.

              What?

       Take an art class?

    No. Teaching art to kids.

      Well, why haven't you
          ever taught?

   I guess I was just expected

  to go in the family business,
            you know?

         The foundation.

       Yeah, but couldn't
         your foundation

       fund art programs?

          Well, I mean,
   we've always veered towards

           scientific
      and medical research.

   My father was such a giant
         in that field.

  But you can make a difference
      with art, too, right?

      Yeah, but, you know,
     my mother just believes

     it's important to honor
       my father's legacy,

        so I don't think
      she'd be comfortable

   with expanding the mandate.

     Well, you said you were
 funding a children's hospital.

       Couldn't you start
      an art program there?

             I mean,
    we gotta build it first.

        We just started.

     Okay, so maybe you can
     speed up the timeline,

            you know,
   and just do what you love.

You know, you said that your dad
       always used to say

          you can wait
      for things to happen,

      or you can make them
        happen yourself.

        Well, sometimes,
       you wait too long.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    good morning, frederick,
           it's avery.

          Yeah, I hope
     you had a nice weekend.

   <i> I just wanted to check in.</i>

         Didn't you get
       my message I left?

        Uh, what message?

      I called to tell you

        there's a problem
       with the painting.

   Wait. What kind of problem?

           A big one.

       <i> When I finally got</i>

       below the varnish,

  I found that the, uh, canvas
    had buckled in two areas.

     <i> There's some cracking</i>

         in the pigment.

    <i> I didn't want to proceed</i>
        <i> until we spoke--</i>

   it involves much more work

            than what
  we had originally discussed.

             <i> Okay,</i>

  but can it still be finished
      in time for the gala?

         I'm afraid not.

             [sighs]

      the gala is all about
         the unveiling.

         What can we do?

      Well, it needs to be
     treated in a vapor tent

  and then a vacuum hot table,

          and all that
      takes a lot of time.

      But it could be done?

        Even if I worked
        around the clock,

       it's not possible.

       What if two of you
    worked around the clock?

         Very few people
       have the experience

           to work on
   a painting of this caliber.

              Ohh.

          [avery sighs]

     "you can't wait around
      for things to happen,

 you have to make them happen."

              I do?

         Oh. Sorry, no.
       I didn't mean you.

               Me.

   I have to make this happen.

     What if I find another
  conservator that you approve?

           -Perhaps--
        -okay! "perhaps"!

          That's better
     than dead in the water,

  let's... Let's go with that.

    Right, okay, well, then,
   when will

             [sighs]

 no, I'm afraid that's too late.
           All right.

            Thank you
     for getting back to me.

            Any luck?

     I called the two names
   that frederick recommended,

      but no one has time.

    If you can't find someone
          by tomorrow,

   we have to let the patrons
      know the amici won't

    be unveiled at the gala.

         You know what,

         tracy works at
  an auction house in new york,

             I mean,
    maybe she knows somebody.

      Did you ever find out
  who took frederick's message?

      No, I asked everyone.

      No one took the call.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             [sighs]

              hey.

     Aren't you going home?

      Not until I fix this.

            You know,
     this isn't your fault.

    Sonya's not blaming you.

           I blame me.
I mean, I went before the board,

 I promised them that the amici
   would be restored in time.

          Okay, listen.
      Worst-case scenario--

     we unveil the painting
        at a later date.

          And I remain
      "associate curator".

         [sighing] ohh.

             Call me
      if you need anything.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             [yawns]

          [phone rings]

             hello?

   Sounds like I woke you up.

       Yeah, I fell asleep
           at my desk.

       I'm in my clothes.
             It's...

      <i> It's not going well.</i>

       Well, this is gonna
          wake you up,

       'cause guess what?

           Emma and I
  have been making some calls,

 and we got some names for you.

     <i> You guys are amazing!</i>

  Yep. I won't argue with that.

    Oh, really, I don't know
    what I'd do without you.

   Go get 'em, madam curator.

             Sonya!

      I found a conservator
     to work with frederick

       that he's approved.

   He thinks they can restore
      the painting in time

   for the gala, but he's not
      making any promises.

      When can they start?

             [sighs]

  you're a big disappointment.

        [guests cheering]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

        [guests laughing]

      this is the best cake
           I ever ate.

             -Whoo!
      -[guests applauding]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

     you look so beautiful.

           Thank you.

      So, I invited peter.

          Uh, so I see.

      Well, he was so nice,

         and, you know,
    he helped with the cake.

          And you were
      trying to set us up.

       Well, you two seem
        so good together.

  Yeah, except when we're not.

          I had no idea
 he was gonna bring a plus-one.

          I'm so sorry.

    I guess he just assumed.

       [avery] it's okay.

      And she's so pretty.

   They seem really... Close.

         So, it's fine.

          Peter and I,
       we're just friends.

      Honestly, it's fine.

              Okay.

               Oh.

        Sorry. Excuse me.

           Of course.

 â™ª you know I feel the tension â™ª

     â™ª invisible invention â™ª

       â™ª you made between
         the two of us â™ª

           â™ª but honey
    you are out of luck... â™ª

         oh, thank you.

         You having fun?

              I am.

     Um, yeah, I'm surprised
        lucy invited me.

         Yeah, so was I.

  Well, uh, you weren't kidding
         when you said,

       "the more weddings,
          the merrier."

       lucy's, the gala...

            ...Yours.

            You know,

     where is the lucky man?

    I would like to meet him.
  I'd like to congratulate him.

              What?

     What... What lucky man?

          -Your fiancÃ©.
          -What fiancÃ©?

     That guy, right there.

          That's ryan--

     that's lucy's brother.

          You and lucy
      are gonna be family?

      Uh... No, we're not.

           Pretty sure
     that's how that works.

        -How what works?
            -In-laws.

       We're not engaged.

 Oh, m-- did you just break up?

              What?

        No-no, n-no, no--
  we-we-we were never together.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              so...

   You're not getting married?

     No. Not that I know of.

      Do you always travel
      with a wedding veil?

              Ohh!

        You saw the veil
        in san francisco

         and you thought
     I was getting married?

              Yeah!

      And I saw you talking
to the concierge about the dress

   and what a beautiful bride
          you would be.

            [laughs]

    no! Tracy and emma and I,
          we bought it

       at an antique store
             because

it has the most romantic history
  and we just couldn't say no.

       I mean, I actually
        couldn't say no,

   and they-- they chipped in.

     Wait, this whole time--

  this whole time, you thought
     I was getting married?

              Yes!

         -[avery laughs]
           -yeah! I...

              -I...
              -Ohh.

        -[avery laughing]
        -I gotta tell ya,

    I've never been so happy
         to be so wrong.

         [peter laughs]

        [laughing] what?

           Um, well...

        Now that it seems
   that we are both single...

           [laughing]

   ...Would you care to dance?

        I would love to.

    But what about your date?

            Oh, um...

  Ahh, well, I thought you were
 gonna be here with your fiancÃ©

          and I didn't
      want to arrive alone,

     so I asked my cousin--

              nina.

             -Right
      -she loves weddings.

      -I mean, who doesn't?
              -Mm.

   Now, how about that dance?

           All right.

 [todd carey's "infinity" plays]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

      â™ª baby, I ain't never
       been good at math â™ª

   â™ª I usually use my fingers
      to subtract or add â™ª

 â™ª something I know is greater â™ª

       â™ª and I don't need
         no calculator â™ª

      â™ª and that's a fact â™ª

        â™ª 'cause as long
        as one plus one â™ª

       â™ª will equal two â™ª

         hey, looks like

     your fiancÃ© and my date
  are actually hitting it off.

         [both laughing]

        â™ª and as sure as
     five plus five is ten â™ª

         â™ª girl, my love
        will never end â™ª

        â™ª gonna hold you
    like there's ten of me â™ª

â™ª gonna love you till infinity â™ª

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   [lucy] all right, everyone,
 it's time to throw the bouquet!

      Come on, get in here.

         Come on, guys.

             Ready?

     Come on, get together!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

     [laughter and hooting]

       [crowd applauding]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

  thanks for bringing me home.

    Yeah, of course, well...

       I mean, your fiancÃ©
       took my date home,

       so it's only fair.

            [laughs]

              uh...

          Look at this.

    I can't-- I can't believe
   I finally got the bouquet.

              Yeah.

   Hey, uh, just so you know,
           that, um...

   That doesn't scare me away.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              I...

        I-I have to work
      early in the morning,

     so I should probably...

     Yeah. Well, I'll, uh...

     I'll see you tomorrow?

         Yes, you will.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          goodnight...

           Goodnight.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

            [exhales]

    maybe the legend is real.

           [chuckles]

      that should do it...

Barring any last-minute changes.

    We did leave a few seats
           open here,

         -at table six.
           -Ah, good.

        What's the status
        of the painting?

     I spoke with frederick
    this morning and he says

       that they're making
         good progress.

        And the caterer?

         Uh, peter and I
     are going there tonight

       to sample the menu.

      You two seem to be...

   <i> Collaborating</i> quite well.

 Well, there was some confusion
        with the veil...

              Yeah.

   But I think we're fine now.

    A veil for the unveiling?

           We decided

      to cover the painting
   with a black velvet cloth.

    Well, I should head back
       to the foundation.

             I mean,
 I do have a day job, after all.

       Oh! Before you go--

    there is one last thing.

           Ever since
      you joined the board,

      you've gone way above
           and beyond.

     Well, it's my pleasure.

    We need someone to unveil
    the painting at the gala.

            I wonder
  if you would do us the honor?

              Uh...

   ...The honor would be mine.

         [sonya] great.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              mm...

       We have a problem.

              What?

      The food is so good,

         no one's gonna
    pay attention to the art.

  Yeah, the<i> rigatoni carciofi--</i>
             <i> bene.</i>

        <i> Parli italiano?</i>

          What's that?

      Do you speak italian?

         Oh, well, yeah,
      I speak italian food.

           [chuckles]

        I'm not kidding,
I've been to a hundred weddings,

     and I have-- I've never
     tasted food this good.

    I don't think I even know
       a hundred couples.

      Well, I was counting
          the weddings

    that I went to as a kid.

  My mom was a wedding planner

   and whenever she couldn't--
 she couldn't find a babysitter,

         she would just
    bring me along with her.

       I even pinched-hit
for the flower girl a few times.

       Yeah, so I grew up
    thinking that, you know,

       flowers and hearts
        and-and "I do's"

       were just the norm.

       I mean, they were,
       for my mom and dad.

 She must be very proud of you.

        Yeah, she passed
         when I was 18.

               Oh.

     Sorry. I-I didn't know.

         No, it's okay.

     I mean, weddings are--
            honestly,

         they're full of
  really happy memories for me.

  So, do you think sonya knows
           that, uh...

          We're dating?

          I didn't know
         we were dating.

        What do you mean,
        you didn't know?

         The first date
      was in san francisco.

             -Yeah--
  -we went to smell the roses.

    ...And then you ran away!

    [groans] aw, okay, well,

         our second date
      was at the mac shack.

   Oh, and that was romantic.

 -Y-you know what was romantic?
    -Romantic mac and cheese.

            [laughs]

   you know, what was romantic
       was lucy's wedding.

       Yeah, but we didn't
       go there together.

   You were with your cousin.

 Who is dating your fiancÃ© now,
           by the way.

           -[laughing]
         -is that weird?

      I mean, they do make
      a really nice couple.

            I guess.

            So do we.

           Yeah. I...

 I just don't, um, I don't want
         to rush things

    or... Complicate things.

              Yeah.

   I mean, I'm nervous enough,

     and I-I think we should
    just keep "collaborating"

      until after the gala.

     And at least now I know
       you don't run cold.

             Well...

    Unless you have any other
      fiancÃ©s lying around.

             Do you?

            -Oh! Hey!
           -I'm back!

     How was the honeymoon?

             Oh, ho.

        Well, other than
        being too short,

          it was great.

          I'm so glad.

  How's everything going here?

     Hectic. It's five days
         until the gala,

           but things
     are going really well.

        All right. Good.

         Morning, jason.

  His art program starts today.

               Oh.

         You all right?
        Everything okay?

           Not really.

         My art program
       is getting derailed

    -before it even started.
       -What do you mean?

       Well, my big get--
 the esteemed professor palmer--

     won't be here in time.

   Oh. Well, I mean, that's--
     that's not your fault.

           Kind of is.

 I was floating so many projects
  trying to get the promotion,

    I accidentally booked him
      on the wrong flight.

       Now it's too late.

        Oh. I'm so sorry.

        Is there anything
        I can do to help?

      Well, there's nothing
         anyone can do.

 I've got a group of school kids
   coming here in a few hours,

  and I have to cancel on them.

       I really don't want
       to make this call.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         I have an idea
 that might solve your problem.

   Okay, okay. You know what,

  I said I was gonna step up...

      So I'm gonna step up.

     But am-am-am I the most
   qualified person for this?

              Yes.

        Because I don't--
      I don't feel like it.

         Well, you have
    a passion for art, okay?

   You have a generous desire
     to share it with kids,

      and how much more of
  a qualification do you need?

      Hey, just think about
         that little boy

       who was so inspired
   by those western paintings

         that he wanted
         to be a cowboy.

       [uncertainly] okay.

              Okay.

    How long is this, though?

          Is it a lon--
       is it a long thing?

          It's an hour.

      And this is something
   you've always wanted to do,

       now you get to see
       if it's a good fit.

  Wh-- what happens if there's,
like, the next picasso out there

         and I send him
          to dentistry?

          You got this.

        You got this! Go.

              Okay.

            [exhales]

           I got this.
     I got this. I got this.

     I got this. I got this.
     I got this. I got this.

              So...
  I don't know about you guys,

         but when I look
        at this sculpture

      and I tilt my head...

     ...It kinda looks like
        "my little pony"

       made out of legos.

               No?

     You guys don't see it?

      What do you guys see?

     It looks like the time

     when my little brother

        left his crayons
       outside in the sun

    and they melted together.

  [laughs] it melted together?

         You know what?

         I can see that.

   And, actually, that is why
  we call this "abstract art".

     Because everybody sees
      something different,

    and it gives us something
 to talk about and think about.

      Do you guys wanna see
         some more art?

          -[kids] yeah!
        -Yeah? All right!

      Having peter fill in
      was a wonderful idea.

      I had no idea he'd be
   so engaging with the kids.

      It was avery's idea.

          She deserves
      the credit for this.

   I appreciate your honesty.

             [sonya]
 it's still your program, jason.

             I think
   you should see it through.

 You should enlist peter's help.

           Thank you.

           Of course.
  I'm just glad it worked out.

        There's something
       I need to tell you.

           I'm the one
      who took the message

     from frederick neumann.

             I know.

       Frederick told me.

      Okay, I don't get it.

 Why did you bail me out today?

         Because I care
        about the museum,

        and you do, too.

        It's a win-win...

       Especially for him.

      You think competitors
         can be friends?

         Apparently so.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             [avery]
    you did a remarkable job.

   It's a remarkable painting.

           [chuckles]

   okay if we crate it up now?

       Yeah, the courier's
          just outside.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    [quiet buzz and chatter]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              wow.

        If... If I forget
       to tell you later,

       you look stunning.

     Thank you. Might I add
      how dashing you look?

           Oh, well...
       The suit's italian.

               Oh!

        I have to keep up
         with our theme.

            [laughs]

   oh, congratulations, peter.

         I think this is
     the most exciting event

       that the stanbridge
          has ever had.

          Thanks, mom.

   Ah, well, you know, I can't
    take full credit, though.

             This...
    This is my collaborator--

         avery morrison.

    It's so nice to meet you,
         mrs. Hastings.

   Oh, please, call me grace.

     You two have made this
    an extraordinary evening.

    Everybody's talking about
      how beautiful it is.

         And of course,
     we're all very excited

      about the unveiling.

    Yeah. Well, I don't think
 anyone's gonna be disappointed.

        Most importantly,

     this beautiful painting
      will finally be seen,

you know, after all these years.

         That's my cue.

  If you'll excuse me, ladies.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

      [speaking over music]
   uh, ladies and gentlemen--

   can I have your attention?

          Thank you all
     for being here tonight.

   My name is peter hastings.

       I, uh, I'm a member
          of the board.

      Tonight, we are here

     to support the museum,

        have a good time,

    and to unveil a painting

       which has not been
         publicly viewed

          in 56 years.

    Some of you may be aware

       of the 19th-century
      artist claudio amici,

but for those of you who aren't,

             I think
    you'll find this painting

       to be a revelation.

       It is my privilege

       to present to you--

     "portrait of a bride".

            [whoosh]

      [gasping and oohing]

      [onlookers murmuring]

        [hushed chatter]

        it's magnificent.

          You and peter
        must be so proud.

   We both worked really hard.

            Peter was
    just incredibly helpful,

     especially when it came
  to researching the painting.

     Well, he's always been
      very taken with art,

           ever since
       he was a young boy.

        He told me about
     the remington paintings

      and how they made him
      want to be a cowboy.

            [laughs]

       and did he tell you
      that he convinced us

   to get him a cowboy outfit
    that he wore everywhere?

     He left that part out.

            [laughs]

    that's one of the things
       I admire about him,

      how he wants to share
      his passion for art.

   Well, I know that he finds
     his work at the museum

        very gratifying.

   It's not just that, though.

           He actually
      jumped in last-minute

   and rescued the children's
   art program the other day,

  and the way he was explaining
    abstract art to the kids,

     it was just... [laughs]
         it was amazing.

      I don't know if peter
    or the kids had more fun.

   Oh, he never mentioned it.

             Really?

    He said that teaching art
       to-to young people

          is something
   he had always wanted to do.

          Oh, I thought
   he'd given up that notion.

         Did-- did I...

       Did I say something
        I shouldn't have?

         -Oh, no, dear.
  -I'm sorry, I just assumed--

         I think it's I
who has been making assumptions.

           [footsteps]

             [lucy]
   I'm so sorry to interrupt.

        There's a person
       from<i> the globe</i> here

 that wants to do an interview.

     Um, excuse me a minute.

           Of course.

   [avery] oh, I have to take
          a look at it.

        Yeah. Of course.

       Hey. Should we grab

         some champagne
         and celebrate?

       Uh, not right now.

           Can I, uh,
   can I talk to you outside?

              Sure.

       Is something wrong?

        Yeah, I just had
 a conversation with my mother.

       I really like her.

 Yeah, she really likes you too,

      but all of a sudden,
         she's concerned

  about some unfulfilled dream
   I have about teaching art.

    Asking if I'm even happy
       at the foundation.

         Are you happy?

      That's not the point.

  I'm sorry, I think I'm lost.
       What is the point?

        My mother puts on
  a brave face in public, okay?

    But she's still mourning
     the loss of my father.

     This foundation is how
      she keeps him alive.

   It's not about what I want,

  it's about my responsibility
          to my family.

        I meant no harm.

    I'm so sorry I upset her.

     Is this just an excuse
       to pull away again?

         Because, peter,

    there's no phantom fiancÃ©
    you can blame this time.

     I'm sorry. I-I just...

        I can't do this.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

        I'm sure you guys

    have better things to do
           on a Sunday

        than listen to me

    <i> whine about last night.</i>

        It's not whining
    when you're in the right.

 [avery]<i> maybe I shouldn't have</i>
  <i> said anything to his mother.</i>

          You were just
       telling the truth.

       It's not your fault

          if he doesn't
     want to acknowledge it.

      All right, let's talk

         about something
    more reliable than love.

           Like what?

          <i> Your career.</i>

    <i> Have you heard anything</i>
      <i> about the promotion?</i>

     Well, I mean, the gala
     went really well, so...

       Hopefully... Maybe?

          I don't know.

 <i> Can you try saying that again</i>

   <i> with a little more belief</i>
          <i> in yourself?</i>

         [scoffs] yeah.

   I gonna need a couple days
      to refill that tank.

        <i> In the meantime,</i>
     <i> we'll believe in you.</i>

           Aw. Thanks.

            You guys,
      go enjoy your Sunday.

           <i> Love you.</i>

            -You too.
          <i> -Talk soon.</i>

   Peter's not the one either.

      It's time to move on.

             [sighs]

         there you are.

       A perk of the job.

     Did you need something?

    I wanted to let you know

    the museum administration
           has decided

         to promote you
        to full curator.

     Congratulations, avery.

   [chuckles] you have no idea
   how much this means to me.

       The last few weeks
        have only proven

    what an invaluable asset
   you are to the stanbridge,

    so I'd say you earned it.

 And I will continue to earn it.
           Thank you.

     Congratulations again.

             [sighs]

            hi, mom.

         Hello, darling.

      What was so important

         that you wanted
      to have lunch today?

      Well, I just thought
     there were some things

   that we needed to clear up.

           Like what?

      I've been doing a lot
   of thinking since the gala.

    If running the foundation

        is not something
      you want to be doing,

       then you shouldn't.

       I never said that.

       Which is why I did.

        All I care about
       is your happiness,

           and that's
    where my happiness lies.

         The foundation
       is well-established

    and your father's legacy
           is secure.

             I heard
      you were quite a hit

          with the kids
       at the stanbridge.

            [laughs]

 avery said you were "amazing".

              Yeah.

 Well, you know, she always sees
       the best in people.

 Well, it took a lot of courage
       for her to speak up

          and tell me,
        ever so sweetly,

        what I might have
      missed about my son.

      And, you know, ah...

 I-- I pushed her away again...

  ...And that's the last thing
       that I want to do.

           Then don't.

            You know,
     when I first met avery,

  I didn't tell her who I was--

         -[grace laughs]
    -...Or what I did and...

          And she still
       seemed to like me.

       All the more reason
          to trust her.

             And...

       Trust how you feel.

    Peter, life is so short,

      and avery strikes me
as a kind of woman worth loving.

  Don't postpone your happiness
          another day.

          Thanks, mom.

 The main gallery.

         Something about
       the amici painting?

    Really? What's it about?

          I don't know.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       are you the reason
       I was called here?

   Yeah, being a board member
         has its perks.

  I didn't mean to ambush you.

            I just...

   I couldn't take the chance
    that you wouldn't see me.

        Avery... [sighs]

           I'm sorry.

       Yeah, I blew things
       out of proportion.

              I...

        It was my fault.

    I won't argue with that.

       Well, that's good,
      because there's more.

              Um...

      I know who I am now,
         because of you.

  And I know what I want to do
          with my life.

             And...

  None of that seems to matter
  if you're not in it with me.

            I, uh...

         I got you these
           because...

        They reminded me
  of the first day that we met.

           [chuckles]

      that was a good day.

              Yeah.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         look, you know
       the feeling you get

  when you find your soulmate?

              Yeah.
   Soulmates are hard to miss.

              Yeah.

    Well, I didn't miss mine.

         Look, I'm sorry
   if I'm over the top, but...

          ...It's just
   that I'm in love with you.

          Over the top
  isn't such a bad place to be

     when it comes to love.

    I'm so in love with you.

            [laughs]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   [quiet chatter, indistinct]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   you make a beautiful bride.

   You're absolutely glowing.

          I always knew
  you'd be the first one of us

         to get married.

       This is officially
 the best weekend reunion ever.

       Don't make me cry.

   My dad already made me cry
   and I had to fix my makeup.

           [sniffles]

        you guys, I know,
    I know have your doubts,

             but...

         I truly believe

        the veil brought
     me and peter together.

 Just because you truly believe
          in true love.

           Yes, I do.

         You're supposed
        to break the tie.

            Oh! Uh...

        I'm on the fence.

             -What?
             -Still?

   [emma takes a deep breath]

       I think I might be
         leaning toward

     "anything is possible".

         I knew it. See?

             Right?

            You win.

           [chuckling]

           all right.

      Let's put the veil on
     so you can get married.

         [all giggling]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           all right.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          is that good?

            Perfect.

         And then some.
             [sighs]

           this is it.

 Your happily-ever-after awaits.

           [laughing]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         are you ready?

            Yes, dad.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          [quietly] hi.

               Hi.

        [minister] we are
       gathered here today

 to join this man and this woman
          in matrimony.

      Do you take this man
       to be your husband?

              I do.

     Do you take this woman
        to be your wife?

              I do.

       I now pronounce you
        husband and wife.

     You may kiss the bride.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    [guests begin applauding]

        [all applauding]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       â™ª as time goes on â™ª

          â™ª I realize â™ª

     â™ª just what you mean â™ª

            â™ª to me â™ª

           â™ª and now â™ª

    â™ª now that you're near â™ª

      â™ª promise your love â™ª

  â™ª that I've waited to share â™ª

         â™ª and dreams â™ª

 â™ª of our moments together... â™ª

       so... Where's finn?

          He's on tour
       with the orchestra.

       What is that look?

         What? No look.

         -[tracy scoffs]
     -this is just my face.

        No. It is a look.
    You are giving me a look.

      Here comes the bride.

              Hey.

        [avery chuckles]

         hi, beautiful!

               Hi!

        There's something
 I really want to show you guys.

       I'll be right back.

             -Yeah?
             -Okay.

              -Ohh!
              -Wow.

              Oh...

  Oh, you can see the influence
     of the italian masters.

       This painting would
   set records at an auction.

    Look at the veil, though.

            [gasping]
       the little heart...

      It looks just like...

            Our veil.

              Wh...

       I never noticed it
      because the painting

     was in such bad shape,

    but I think someone just
   added the beaded headband.

 But I thought they were a set.

          I... [sighs]

   I think it's the same veil.

       What are the odds?

            Very low.

       Hilda said the veil
 was 19th-century italian lace.

       This a 19th-century
   italian portrait of a bride

  wearing the same veil as me.

       I just don't think
 that it could be the same veil.

    -I'm telling you, it is!
            -Avery---

           you know...

  I'm going to Italy next month
            to teach.

      I could take the veil

        and-and research
         its provenance.

              Yeah.

       That's a good idea.

 And then we don't have to worry
  about who gets the veil next.

     Well, only if you won't
         be needing it.

 Finn and I are fine as we are--
       no rings, no rice.

    You should take the veil.

 Okay. Only because I'm curious
       about its history.

        Yeah. Definitely.

          For research.

      "it's just research."

           [laughing]

              yes.

  Well, when I first met avery,

     I fell in love with her
           right away,

   but I thought she was taken
      because of the veil.

     We got to follow along
          in real time.

       Yeah, but the veil
   didn't break us up, though,

           it actually
      brought us together.

         I don't follow.

              Uh...

          You told him
    about the legend, right?

               No.

          What legend?

    The legend is, whoever's
    in possession of the veil

      will find true love.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    well, I'll drink to that.

         To the veil...

          To the veil.

        And to true love.

         â™ª one fine girl
