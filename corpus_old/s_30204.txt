"For heroism above
and beyond the call of duty.

For successfully infiltrating
the enemy's ranks...

...and securing victory independently,
with cunning and honor."

(CANNONS BOOMlNG)

Captain John Boyd.

SLAUSON: Amen.
MEN: Amen.

SLAUSON:
You're no hero, Boyd.

l want you as far from my company
as possible.

l'm sending you to California.

Fort Spencer.

Please, gentlemen, quickly.

l want all of that in the largest
office on the left.

Careful. Don't scratch it.

Come, come, come.

SOLDlER'S VOlCE:
Lieutenant Boyd! Lieutenant Boyd!

Lieutenant Boyd!


Boyd!

Boyd!

Help me!

Captain John Boyd.

War hero, huh?

So the brass decided to reward you...

...with a little appointment
to the California sun?

Have a walnut, Boyd.

Martha brought them in fresh
from San Miguel.

This is my hobby.

Reading in the original languages.

Well, you know, languages in general.

lt's tedious, l know...

...but then this place thrives
on tedium.

So... .

You have a hobby, Boyd?

Swimming.

Swimming.

l hope you don't mind hard water.

Fort Spencer.

The Spanish built this place
as a mission.

We inherited her. Now we're
a weigh station...

...for travelers on their way
through the Nevadas.

We don't get much traffic
here in the winter...

...so we maintain a skeleton company
that consists of Private Toffler...

...who's our personal emissary
from the Lord.

Major Knox, who never met a bottle
he didn't like.

Private Reich, he's our soldier.

l'd steer clear of him.

And Martha, you've met. l bet you
didn't get a word out of her.

And George, her brother.

They're both locals and sort of
came with the place.

And then there's Private Cleaves.

The over-medicated Private Cleaves.

And you and l make eight.

Cleaves cooks. Knox used to be
a veterinarian, so he plays doctor.

My advice to you is, don't get sick.

l'd say don't eat,
but then most of us have to.

So with your promotion, you'd be
number three in command.

Toffler's prayer.

O, Heavenly Father,
bless these to our use... .

-Amen.
-Amen.

So, did anyone do anything today?

We have a great sense of camaraderie
here at Fort Spencer.

MAN 1 :
How'd you get behind the enemy line?

BOYD:
I froze. I was scared.

MAN 1 :
Scared?

You froze while the rest
of your unit fought...

...and died?

MAN 2:
What did you do then?

BOYD:
I played dead.

MAN 1 :
But you made it behind enemy lines.

BOYD:
I was buried...

... with my commanding officer's
half-shot-off head in my face.

His blood running down my throat.


MAN 2:
So how did you take the command post?

BOYD:
Something....

Something had changed.


(MEN SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH)

MAN 2: We're gonna promote you, Boyd.
We could shoot you...

...but as you captured the enemy
command, it might set a bad precedent.

HART:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Last-minute addition to the post.

All right, Cleaves. Let's hear it.

Salt, meat, beans, coffee...

...oil, bacon, flour.

All right. Now, l want you back
in three days.

No local weed.

No peyote.

-No women.
-No women.

Martha, keep him out of trouble.

Okay, have a nice trip.

Come on.

We'll pick up some salt...

...meat, beans, local weeds, women.

MARTHA: No women.
CLEAVES: l can't get a woman if l... .

Wish you were along for the ride?

What did you get the medal for?

Cowardice.

Knox has got some excellent bourbon.
lt's really fine stuff.

And he just passed out about...

...a minute ago.

So l'm wondering if you
would like to...?

-He won't mind?
-Probably.

To escape.

ln one form or another.

Toffler.

Toffler!

What are you doing?

lt's a religious hymn.

l'm writing a religious hymn.

Well, could you find some inspiration
somewhere else?

And could you get us some ice?

Funny thing.

We escape the world.

We come here...

...and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place.

The frightening thing
about escape, though...

...the chance you might end up
someplace worse.

He was here.

Reich, go that way.

-Colonel?
-Yeah.

Who are you?

Reich! Reich!

-He's alive.
RElCH: Jesus Christ!

HART: Just barely.
Let's get him inside.

We need hot water.
George, Toffler, hot water.

Lots of hot water.
Reich, go rouse Knox.

Let's get those rags off him.

See if we can get his blood moving.

Toffler, more water.

HART:
l think he'll live.

Easy, easy, easy. Blanket.

Well, he's warm.

Frostbite didn't seem
to do much damage.

l guess the only thing we can do
is let him rest.

And pray. Toffler, your duty.

Good work.

Each one of these squares
is 1 mile by 1 .5 miles.

lt takes about three days, actually--

Yes?

He's up. Excellent.

He's up. Let's go.

Major Knox?

Major Knox?

Doc? Doc?

Doc, he's awake.

What? Who?

The man who showed up last night.

He's gonna tell us what happened.


Where?

Where am l?

Fort Spencer, California.

Western Sierra Nevadas.

Excuse me.

l'm sorry.

My name's Colqhoun.

F.W. Colqhoun, servant of God.

How are you feeling, Mr. Colqhoun?

Not bad, considering.

Probably look like death.

HART:
Not bad, considering.

How long were you out there?

Three months.

-Without food?
-Yes.

-Toffler, help him.
COLQHOUN: Good Lord.

Good Lord.

You should have seen me
three months ago.

l was 30 pounds heavier.

l'm sorry, but you did say
no food for three months?

l said no food. l didn't say
there was nothing to eat. Understand?

Do you understand?

l suppose l owe you gentlemen a story.

HART:
Only if you feel up to it.

Yes.

We left in April.

Six of us in all.

Mr. MacCready and his wife
from Ireland.

Mr. Janus, from Virginia, I believe...

... with his servant, Jones.

Myself, l'm from Scotland.

And our guide...

...a military man, coincidentally.
A Colonel lves.

l don't think l know him.

The better for you.

A detestable man.

The most disastrous guide.

He professed to know...

...a new, shorter route
through the Nevadas.

Quite a route that was.

Longer than the known one...

...and impossible to travel.

We worked very, very hard.

By the first snow, we were 1 00 miles
from this place. That was November.

Proceeding in the snow was futile.

We took shelter in a cave.

Decided to wait until
the storm had passed.

But the storm did not pass.

The trail soon became impassable...

...and we had run out of food.

We ate the oxen...

...all the horses...

...even my own dog.

And that lasted us about a month.

After that we turned to our belts.

Shoes.

Any roots we could dig up,
but you know...

...there's no real
nourishment in those.

We remained famished.

The day that Jones died,
l was out collecting wood.

He had expired from malnourishment.

When l returned, the others were
cooking his legs for dinner.

Would l have stopped it
had l been there?

l don't know.

But l must say...

...when l stepped inside that cave...

...the smell of meat cooking... .

l thanked the Lord.

l thanked the Lord.

And then things got out of hand.

l ate sparingly.

Others did not.

The meat did not last us a week,
and we were soon hungry again.

Only this time our hunger
was different.

More severe.

Savage.

And Colonel lves, particularly,
could not be satisfied.

Janus was the first to be killed.

And then Mr. MacCready.

That left Colonel lves,
MacCready's wife and l alone.

And l knew in that company
that my days were numbered.

l'm ashamed to say that l acted
in a most cowardly manner.

lt would've been nobler to stay and
protect Mrs. MacCready from lves...

...but l was weak.

l fled.

lt was nothing less than pure
providence that l arrived here.

Mrs. MacCready, is she still there?

And Colonel lves, as far as l know.

Let's pack up.

We've got to go up there.
We've got to go, it's our job.

TOFFLER: Why go?
HART: lt's our job!

Here's for you. Here's Toffler.

Reich has got his own rifle
and l've got my pistol.

l think the cave's three
or four days' march from here.

What is it, George?

What?

GEORGE: Windigo.
HART: Windigo?

Windigo.

(SPEAKS lN NATlVE LANGUAGE)

HART:
lt's an old lndian myth from the north.

A man eats another's flesh...

...usually an enemy.

And he takes-- Steals...

...his strength, his essence,
his spirit.

And his hunger becomes craven.

lnsatiable.

And the more he eats,
the more he wants to.

And the more he eats,
the stronger he becomes.

George, people don't still do that,
do they?

White man eats the body of
Jesus Christ every Sunday.

Line them up!

Major Knox, we're leaving now.

You'll be in charge until l return.
Here's the key to the arsenal.

Martha and Cleaves will be back
in a few days, all right?

(KNOX VOMlTS)

Too much bourbon in his bourbon.

ls he all right?

Yeah, he'll be fine.

Mr. Colqhoun?

Getting dressed?

l'm coming with you.

l must. You don't stand a chance
of finding her without me.

HART: Well, you're right. You're
a good man. Thank you.

Colonel Hart? Colonel Hart?

HART:
What?

Oh, thank you, thank you.

Need that.

COLQHOUN:
Colonel Hart?

Where's my other glasses?
Holy Jesus. Sorry.

(TOFFLER SlNGS QUlETLY)

Loyal servant....

Fervent.

Who entrusts in you

Your faith so fervent

Clouds moving in.

Watch out, now.

Bourbon break. Rest stop.

Want some?

Colqhoun?

Reich?

Mr. Colqhoun?

You said that when you
ate the men--

Do you mind if l ask?

You said that afterwards your hunger
was different, that you felt wanton?

Yes.

Did you feel at all
physically changed?

Stronger?

l seem to remember something like that.

A certain...

...virility.

Why do you ask?

Hey! Look, look, look!

lt's a bone!

lt's a bone.

He's all right!

You all right?

l would very much appreciate
some of that bourbon now.

Bourbon, now!

HART:
Boyd?

Would you administer some of this
to Toffler? Thank you.

A war hero...

...afraid of the sight of blood?

(TOFFLER SCREAMS)

HART:
What? What? What?

BOYD:
What is it?

What is it? What is it?

Wake up. Wake up.

lt's all right.

Toffler, what's the matter?

BOYD:
Wake up, wake up.

BOYD:
You all right?

-He was licking me.
-What?

He was... .
He was licking me.

No.

He was licking me!

HART:
Reich!

Yes!

Re-bandage Toffler's wounds.

Mr. Colqhoun, you come outside.

Outside! You can sleep outside!

Boyd, you too.

-Stay there.
-Sick man outside!

Colonel Hart, l can explain.

Explain!

lt's not what you think, l--

l was having a nightmare.
l was having a nightmare!

Your man screamed. l woke up on top
of him. My lips were on his wound.

Jesus Christ, l'm sorry.

Please restrain me.
Restrain me, Colonel Hart.

l can't be trusted, please.
l insist.

l insist.

Too tight, Mr. Colqhoun?

Windigo.

HART:
l take it that's the cave.

Yeah.

All right.

George...

...come on.

COLQHOUN:
No, please. God!

RElCH:
Quiet!

No, please.

No, please!

HART:
Flank on the left.

(COLQHOUN CRlES)

-Please!
-Come on.

Please, l don't want to go. Please!

Boyd.

Please.

Mrs. MacCready!

Please! They're going to kill me.

Shut up!

Colonel lves!

Reich!

Break out the lantern.

George, Toffler,
stand guard where you are.

Here.

You'll have to go in with Reich.

l'm sorry, but l need
an officer in there. Here.

Just stay the hell out of my way,
right?

She's not here, we go back, right?

We go back?

We go all the way back.

(BAT SQUEALS)

RElCH:
Well, well.

Blood.

Boyd.

What are you doing?

l'm sorry.

After you...

...captain.

Captain?

Sorry.

Thank you.

TOFFLER:
Mr. Colqhoun.

Mr. Colqhoun!

He's spooked.

He's spooking me.

Reich!

-Boyd!
-Reich?

The colonel's calling us.

Reich.

Jesus!

Oh, God.

Two, three, four, five... .

How many did he say was in the party?
Six?

Why?

Who's this?

lves? Oh, Jesus.

lt's a trap!

RElCH:
Boyd!

He killed everyone.

Colqhoun killed everyone!

Colonel Hart!

Kill him!

Reich!

God...

...that's so annoying.

Run.

Run, run, run.

(COLQHOUN LAUGHS)

RElCH:
Colonel Hart!

Col--!

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Oh, God.

BOYD: Colonel.
RElCH: He got George.

Toffler. Where's Toffler?

Toffler!

(TOFFLER YELPS)

There he is. Let's go.

Go...

-...get him.
-Boyd!

You can't help him!

He's dead, soldier. Now let's move!

Boyd!

(TOFFLER SCREAMS)

Shh, shh.

You loaded?

Of course.

Let's go kill that bastard.

Come on, move!

Move!

Reich.

l'm gonna go back.

l'm gonna go back.

Find him.

(RElCH SCREAMS)

Jesus Christ!

(COLQHOUN GROANS)


Come here.

Get away from me.

Get away from me!

(MlMlCS BOMB DROPPlNG)



(COLQHOUN LAUGHS)

(WOLVES HOWLlNG)

BOYD:
Cold, Reich?

Mind if l take your coat?

l'm freezing.

Nice.

(COLQHOUN LAUGHS)

What do you think, major?

Should we stay here?

l'd say take the hill.

And you just tell me what to do.

l need--

l need you to tell me what to do.

Tell me what to do.

Oh, God.

Mercy.

Goddamn you, you're dead.
You're dead.

You're safe now.

You're safe now.

Boyd?

Martha, Knox, it's Boyd!

All right, now. Hold on there.

(COLQHOUN LAUGHS)

Martha, l must talk to you.

l need to-- Windigo.

l need to know how to stop it.

l need you to help me.

l'm sorry about your brother.

l did not kill him.

l did not kill him, Martha.

-How do you stop it?
-You don't.

Do you ever give yourself?

Windigo eats.

Must eat more, more. Never enough.

He takes. Never, never gives.

You start Windigo.

You give yourself.

You must die.

There's no sign of anyone.
No sign of a sign of anyone.

Not Colonel Hart's rescue party,
not the original party.

-You found the cave.
-There's nothing in there.

There's nothing inside.

There's no blood tracks,
no rope, no bodies.

-You don't believe me, sir?
-We have four missing soldiers...

...and no bodies. We need
a supportable explanation.

Now, your story, this "Windigy"
is the stuff of campfires.

Would you stop squirming, Lindus?
l know l mispronounced it.

l'm making a point.

My point is, captain, we need facts.
Not myths.

l told you the facts, sir.

lf you altered your story, it wouldn't
be perceived as retracting a lie.

Only clarifying...

...a muddled recollection.

On the day that we spoke to you,
you were out of your head with fear.

l was coherent then.
l am coherent now, sir.

-l remember--
-Perhaps in the wilderness...

...you got separated
from your company.

That's why l'm giving you
this second opportunity.

l'd advise that...

...you change your story, Boyd.

-Who's that?
-New colonel.

KNOX:
We'll go inside and get some warmth.


Yes?

-Sir, the colonel's here.
-Thank you, Lindus.

We brought in an interim officer
until we can...

...appoint a permanent replacement
for Colonel Hart.

Captain, this is Colonel lves.

Colonel, Captain Boyd.

How's the leg?

Lindus.

Let's step outside.

What is the matter with you,
Captain Boyd?

-lt's him.
-lt's who?

-lt's him, sir.
-Who is?

-He's Colqhoun, sir.
-Colonel lves is... .

He's the one
that killed them all, sir.

-Are you mad?
-Let Major Knox look at him, sir.

-Major Knox was here.
-Major Knox?

-Let Major Knox look at him, sir.
-Major Knox?

Major Knox.

KNOX:
He doesn't look familiar to me, sir.

l do remember the man wore a beard.

But as l was saying, sir...

...l was feeling a bit ill that day.

-You were drunk.
-Captain, please.

Boyd, you say you fired
on this Colqhoun.

Struck him in the shoulder.

That would leave a wound,
now, wouldn't it?

l presume so.

Well, why don't we check.
Colonel lves...

-...would you humor me a moment?
-Of course, sir.

Would you...?

Would you take off your shirt,
please, and show me your shoulder?

Please, colonel.

Please.

Well, l... .

My last physical examination was...

...not that long ago.

Surely Major Knox has no desire
to hear me cough?

The other shoulder, please, colonel.

Thank you, colonel.

Not at all.

-ls there a problem?
SLAUSON: Not with you, colonel.

General, we should leave now
in order to avoid the storm.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

Boyd told the general
Colonel lves killed everyone.

MARTHA:
What?

He said Colonel lves
was the man responsible.

Boyd gone loco.

l think he's the reason
nobody come back.

l have to warn you.

Yeah, captain?

Consider yourselves warned.

Do you need this?

No, sir.

Good.

KNOX:
You're not an eater of ribs, colonel?

No, no, major. l...

...can never forget it
used to be an animal.

Sentimental fellow.

Captain, you don't eat meat?

KNOX:
Oh, no, he won't.

Only as a last resort.

That's a pity.

Boyd, no!

(CLEAVES LAUGHS)

Damn.

Checkmate.

Well, well.

lt appears a number of us
could use some rest.

Go on to bed, Boyd.

COLQHOUN:
Clearing up.

l found your Private Reich up there.

What was left. You didn't finish.

Well, l can't blame you.
He was tough.

But then...

...a good soldier ought to be.

You know, not long ago
l couldn't do that.

l could barely take a breath
without coughing up a pint of blood.

Tuberculosis.

That, along with...

...fierce headaches...

...depression...

...suicidal ambition... .

l was in pretty horrible shape.

ln fact...

...l was on my way to a sanitorium
to convalesce, more likely to die...

...when en route...

...this lndian scout told me
a curious story.

A man eats the flesh of another...

...he steals his strength.

He absorbs...

...the other man's spirit.

Well...

...l just had to try.

Consequently, l ate the scout first,
and he was absolutely right.

l grew...

...stronger.

Later, my wagon train
grew lost in the Rockies.

l've heard this story before.

l ate five men in three months.

Tuberculosis?

Vanished.

As did the black thoughts.

l reached the end
of that spring feeling...

...happy...

...and healthy...

...and virile.

Did you eat her too?

-As a matter of fact... .
-You're disgusting.

One year later...

...l feel more alive than ever before.

That's what surprises me
about you, Boyd.

You've tasted it...

...felt its power.

Yet you're resisting.

-Why?
-Because it's wrong.

Morality:

The last bastion...

...of a coward.

l'm sorry.

l'm sorry.

Did l offend you?

Remember this?

You smell it?

Scent always jogs the memory,
don't you think?

Remember the energy?

The potency of someone else coursing
through your veins.

Someone brave.

Knowing the disappointment
as it dissipates.

The strength...

...slipping from your grasp.

Growing...

...killing need to replenish.

l don't have to remind you of that.

You feel it right now.

l am gonna kill you.

He die, you die.

What in the heck is going on out here?

COLQHOUN:
Captain Boyd attacked me.

You liar.

He's lying!

Boyd, l'm putting you under arrest.

Martha, go wake up Cleaves.
Put Boyd under arrest.

Cleaves?

Cleaves.

Cleaves?

Cleaves?

-You find Cleaves?
-No.

-You check around outside?
-No.

Well, check around outside, woman!

Cleaves?

(WOOD CREAKS)

Cleaves?

Cleaves?

Major Knox!

Major!

-Major!
KNOX: What?

MARTHA:
All horses...

-...dead!
-What?

Killed.

KNOX:
Oh, good gracious.

That was for Cleaves.

And this is for my horse.

KNOX:
Martha...

...Colonel lves and l have agreed
Boyd'll be moved...

...to a military prison
as soon as possible.

One of us must travel
to San Miguel by foot...

...to get General Slauson.

Volunteers?

Safe travel to you, Martha.


BOYD:
Knox!

Major Knox.

Knox?

Major Knox?

Major Knox?

Knox!

Talk to me. l'd like
to know you're still alive.

Be quiet, Boyd.

KNOX:
Good gracious.

Colonel lves...

-...my sword is missing.
-l'm sorry, major?

My sword.

ln the parlor above the fire.

l haven't seen it.

-What? Are you cooking?
-lt's...

...stew.

-You need any help?
-No, no, though...

...perhaps later you might...

...contribute.

You let me know.

BOYD:
lves.

lves!

Yes, captain.

BOYD:
When did you do it, lves?

-Do what, captain?
-Kill Cleaves and the horses.

l watched you the whole time.

You be quiet about Cleaves
and the horses, Boyd!

You hear me?

Or l will put you out again.

Now, how'd that door come open?

That'll do it.

Good gracious!

(SWORD SWlSHES)

BOYD:
Knox?

Knox?


Hello, Boyd.

l hated doing that.

l told you my regimen had certain
curative powers, Boyd.

Get him up and around.

Leg still hurt?

Doesn't have to, you know.

You killed Cleaves...

...and the horses.

What happened to you?

l thought l was dead.

l remember feeling panic
as my life slipped away.

lt was like drowning in darkness,
and then...

...there was nothing.

And then l woke up.

lves was feeding me.

By the time l regained my senses,
there was no turning back.

l feel terrific.

-So you're gonna kill me?
-No.

lt's lonely being a cannibal.

Tough making friends.

l like you, Boyd.

We're gonna bring you into the fold.

You gotta eat.

HART:
Finished?

COLQHOUN: l'm afraid Major Knox
has polished off the bourbon.

Couldn't leave him in the pink.

You take over.

COLQHOUN:
Manifest...

...Destiny.

Westward...

...expansion.

You know, come April...

...it will all start again.

Thousands of gold-hungry Americans
will travel over those mountains...

...on their way to new lives...

...passing right through here.

We won't kill...

...indiscriminantly.

No.

Selectively.

Good God!

We don't want to break up families.

-People aren't stupid, lves.
-Really?

-You'll get caught.
-Well, if it's just the two of us.

Jolly old Hart and l.

You see, that's why we need others.

You, for one.

General Slauson.

We don't wish to recruit everyone.
We have enough mouths to feed.

We just need a home.

And this country...

...is seeking to be whole.

Stretching out its arms...

...and consuming all it can.

And we merely follow.

Not me.

You know, it's not courage
to resist me, Boyd.

lt's courage to accept me.

l mean, you're already one of us.

Well...

...almost.

You hunger for it.

You just won't resign yourself to it.

lt's not so difficult, really.

Acquiescence.

lt's easy, actually.

You just give in.

l can't.

Oh, well.

Then...

...you die.

lt's all right. lt's not fatal.

Not with the necessary precautions.

HART:
Stew à la Major Knox.

This'll fix you up.

The old souse was a lot stronger
than he looked.

A couple of doses of this, you'll be
right as rain. And twice as strong.

Well.

lsn't this civilized?

Mmm.

You know...

...Ben Franklin once said:

"Eat to live.

Don't live to eat."

Huh? Huh?

Well, it's an easy decision, Boyd.

You can either famine or feast.

Live or die.

Bravo.

Here, chicky, chicky, chicky!
Chicky, chicky, chicky!

Run away. Run for your lives!

-Having fun?
-Morning.

COLQHOUN:
General's coming. Remember?

Well, you're up.

Feeling better?

"Waste not, want not."

Ben Franklin.

How's the wound?

Right as rain.

Yeah.

So it is.

l could use some fresh air.

Are you to be trusted?

Of course not.

Walnut, Boyd?

All my books are gone.
l'll miss them.

Plato, Aristotle...

...for two millennia, struggling
with the nature of man...

...the ideal society, morality.

Boil it down...
