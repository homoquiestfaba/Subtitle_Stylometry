<i>Los Angeles Tower,</i>
<i>this is Transworld 22 Heavy.</i>

<i>We are going down!</i>
<i>Repeat, engines two and...</i>

<i>L.A. Tower, this is...</i>

<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

<i>22 Heavy, pull up! Pull up!</i>

Andrew,
this is your father.

Hello?

Look, you don't call me back,
so I don't know how to do this.

If you're not gonna
return my calls...

then there's no way
for us to communicate...

<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>how to do this...</i>

<i>but you're gonna need</i>
<i>to come home now.</i>

<i>Last night...</i>

<i>Your mother died</i>
<i>last night, Andrew.</i>

<i>She drowned.</i>

<i>Last night,</i>
<i>she drowned in the bath.</i>

Ten résumés just today.

They come in every day
from Idaho or Milwaukee or Florida.

And you know what they want even more than
a guest spot on <i>Everybody Loves Raymond?</i>

They want your job. This cannot happen again.
This will never happen again.

You have two tables.
You are 30 minutes late.

And if I ever say this again,
your job will go to...

Todd Slauson
from Duluth, Minnesota.

Sparkling or flat?

Waiter 10,
do you have your earpiece in?

You forget the order 41
for Table 101.

What the fuck, man?
What, are you on break?

<i>Nah, I'm just</i>
<i>messin'with you.</i>

Uh, we'll have four
Ketel Red Bulls and...

And I'll have a Ketel cosmo
with a Red Bull and some bread ASAP.

We don't have bread.

What do you mean?
How can you not have bread?

Uh, we're a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don't have bread.

But you're
not Vietnamese.

No, I'm not.

Can I have something to chew on?
Fuck. Bamboo, whatever.

I'll see what I can find.

<i>Waiter number 12...</i>

<i>Flight Number 121</i>
<i>with nonstop service...</i>

<i>to Newark International</i>
<i>will be departing from Gate 32.</i>

<i>Shit, yo.</i>

Holy shit.

What's up, man?

Largeman, what are you
doing here?

Uh, that's my mom.

Fuck.
Oh, fuck.

Sorry.

Yeah.

So, welcome back home.

Thanks.

So what have you
been doing?

You still, uh,
acting and shit, right?

Yeah.
<i>- L-In L.A., right?</i>

Yeah.
<i>- That's cool.</i>

I hear that place
is, like, fucking crazy.

My cousin's a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.

<i>He's, like, writing a movie</i>
<i>about snowboarders or some shit.</i>

I don't...
I don't know.

Um, but I should
introduce you to him, Largeman.

Maybe you two
could do something together.

Yeah, definitely.

What are you
doing tonight, man?

Uh, nothing.
No real plans.

I'm just in town
for a couple days, so...

You should
come out with us.

We're gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They're having some...

fucking huge party
or something.

Supposedly.
Well, yeah. Supposedly.

Really?
<i>- He lives up on the hill.</i>

We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.

<i>- Well, I got to shower.</i>
<i>- Same.</i>

<i>Do you know your mother</i>
<i>redid the hallway bathroom?</i>

What?
I'm sorry. What?

Since I met her,
she never showed an interest in anything.

All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up...

she wants to redecorate
a bathroom.

I helped her.

Oh, must have been fun.
Well, I sew.

I made you something.

It's a shirt.

That's... That's good.
Thank you.

Will you try it on now?

Now?

In case I have to fix it
before you leave again...

and we don't see you
for another nine years.

I wanna make sure it fits.

Oh. Okay.

You're gonna
love the material.

I used the leftovers from
your mother's design. Gorgeous.

Hi.

Hello.
How you doing?

"Well, besides that,
Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"

You know, I'm not really sure what
to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry.

Mm.

<i>How are you?</i>

I'm okay.

I've been getting these
really bad headaches though.

<i>Um, they're really quick.</i>

It's like a... just a little
lightning storm in my head.

Just for a second,
and then it's gone.

I just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while I'm home.

Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.

He's a neurologist in my building.
I-I'll call him.

He'll fit you in. I'm sure it's
nothing to worry about.

Place looks good.

Oh, that's nice. Yeah, we've been
doing a lot of work on it.

Really?

Actually, no.
I don't know why I just said that.

Someone redid the, uh,
hallway bathroom. I saw that.

Yeah. That's new.

I'm glad you're here.

Saying good-bye
is important.

I'm glad you could
fit it in.

Put your hands on your head, please.
What?

I said put your motherfucking hands
on your head! Please.

Eighty-two in a 25.

What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or just tired?

I was...
Shut the fuck up!

Largeman.
Kenny?

Holy shit!

Oh, man.
How you doing?

I'm... I'm great.

Your mom just died!
I know.

I mean, that's why you're home.
Yeah. Yup.

You're a cop, Kenny?

Yeah, I know. I know.
Why?

I don't know. Couldn't think of
anything better to do.

No, but it's really cool
though, man.

People really
listen to you. I mean...

they have to!

Yo, and check this shit out. That's the safety.
Oh, cool.

And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I'm like...

rich!

But, Kenny, the last time I saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.

No, I had to grow up, man.

It's time to grow up. Plus, I wasn't
making shit in that fish market.

No one knew who I was,
couldn't get laid.

It's a much better
situation for me, man.

Speaking of which,
um, how'd I do?

What do you mean?

I don't know.
You know, just the whole...

You mean, like, as a cop?

Yeah. The whole,
"Shut the fuck up!"

Well, I thought you were a dick,
so I guess that's good.

Nice. So,
what the fuck, man?

You're this huge movie star now?
I heard you did some...

you played a big football player
or something.

I didn't see it.
It was just this thing...

Fucking De Niro and shit.
What?

He's awesome.
Yeah.

<i>- Deer Hunter?</i>
Yeah.

Man, we should sit down
and we should talk...

because I've got some
really good ideas for movies.

You could play me
and shit. Poof!

<i>- Stories from the Force.</i>
Yeah.

Yeah, definitely. That sounds good.

Holy shit!
What's up?

How you doing, man?
How you doing, man?

<i>- What's up?</i>
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.

<i>Get this guy a beer. This guy does not</i>
<i>wait for a beer. He's a movie star.</i>

Like, uh, Jersey's
De Niro and shit.

Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
I, uh...

Press junket.

That's phat, yo.
Fuck, yeah!

<i>Serpico</i> and shit.
"Attica!"

<i>Shut the fuck up, man.</i>

You like that?

Like, uh,
"press junket"?

That's improv, bitch.
You can use it. Right?

Okay. Let me
show you something.

Largeman! Oh, whoa!
What's going on, man?

How you been?
Hey!

Jess. How are you, brother?
How's it going, man?

I haven't seen you in so long.
I heard you're kicking ass.

Oh, um, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.

What?
I developed this little item.

It's just like Velcro,
but it doesn't make that...

the Velcro noise.

So how much did they buy it for?
A lot, man.

Wow. So wh-what are you
doing with yourself?

Um, nothing.
Nothing.

<i>I've never been so bored</i>
<i>in my whole life.</i>

Yeah. First month I went out.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.

But, y...
Nothing.

<i>Someone got</i>
<i>a joint for me?</i>

Here you go.

Oh. No, thanks, man.

Really? I thought you were
a big movie star and shit.

Nah.
<i>- Well, then here.</i>

Eat this.

<i>Welcome home.</i>

I guess I'll see you guys later.

Should we
play a game?

<i>Let's play</i>
<i>"spin the bottle."</i>

I'm not playing "spin the bottle."
How old are we?

Or more importantly, how old are they?
Oh, they're all legal.

I think.

<i>Well, we just ate</i>
<i>all this fucking "X,"</i>

so what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

Girl has a point.

<i>- Fucking right.</i>
<i>- I'm in!</i>

<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- Large!</i>

<i>Large!</i>

Largeman, this is Dana.
Hi.

Hi.

Who's up?

Whoo!

This is gonna be a good night.

It's good, isn't it?

I always try to save a couple
of the marshmallows till the very end...

but I never make it.

I always end up with...

a bunch of flake things
and pink milk.

My mind wanders.

<i>So, Tim...</i>

How long have you been
working at Medieval Times?

Three years. B-But I've
only been a knight for two.

You have to
pay your dues.

I worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.

When I started,
he was making the coleslaw.

It hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.

But I really
just stirred it.

Don't be modest.

Mr. Modesty won
the joust last night.

Congratulations.
It's not that big a deal. It's fixed.

<i>What was it that happened</i>
<i>to you in high school?</i>

You had a thing.
I forgot what it was.

He got the shit kicked out of him.
No, he didn't.

How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.

I fucked him up too.
He knocked your teeth out.

He only chipped one tooth.

So, uh, w-what are you
up to now, Mark?

You're digging graves?

Mark's getting into
real estate.

Tim can speak Klingon.
What?

No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

What the fuck is Klingon?
Like the <i>Star Trek</i> guys?

Yeah, he can speak their language.
No, she's kidding.

No, I'm not.
Why are you being shy?

Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
It's just... It's made-up.

This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. I don't...

Don't be shy. Tell them
what you said to me last night.
No.

Say what you said
to her last night.

You gotta be kidding me.

It means, "I like to
mate after battle."

That's not what I said.
Yeah.

No. No. That wasn't
the one I said.

This one means,
"Kill Kirk"...

and also "Hallelujah,"
depending on the context.

You must have got it
confused with, uh...

Honey, that is good.
You know what that means, Tim?

Well, I do. It means,
"Get the fuck out of my house...

before I chop
your fucking head off."

Mark, he's a knight.

He's just a fast-food knight.

I should get going.

Thanks, uh,
for the cereal.

I had a lovely evening.

By the way, it says
"balls" on your face.

Asshole.
My mom did it.

In the spring...

the hungry gator must find
new and clever ways to find food.

Did you tell Large
about... the tapes?

No, Mom. I'm not doing
those stupid tapes.

What are the tapes?
Real estate tapes.

You can make up to
$100,000 your first year.

You should have seen the boat
this Oriental guy had.

He even had his own game show in China,
he had so much money.

I think Mark would be
perfect at it.

Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes.
Okay? It's a scam.

Well, I'm doing it.
I'm saving up for those tapes.

Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

You know what?
I do apply myself every day, Mom.

I work my ass off
burying dead people. Okay?

I'm only 26. I'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?

Just let me be.
I don't rush you.

Okay. Then I'll
do 'em myself.

Fine. Do 'em.

Okay, then I won't
let you on my yacht.

Except Large. Large, you can
come anytime you want.

Just don't bring
your friend here.

Shit! I got to go
to my meeting.

Okay.

I love you.

I love you too.
I love you.

Large, it was nice to see you.
Nice to see you too.

Oh. Oh, you guys,
don't stay in here all day...

'cause I took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.

It was beeping all night.

She drives me crazy!

<i>She gets all baked out and makes me</i>
<i>feel like I have to impress her.</i>

And you know what?

I'm okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.

Hey, what time is it?
No idea.

I gotta go.

Hi, I'm Andrew Largeman.
I'm sorry.

I'm really late for my appointment.
Andrew. Andrew.

Okay, Andrew. I'm gonna need you
to fill out this paperwork for me.

As soon as we're ready,
we'll call you in.

Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry.
It's okay. Have a seat.

<i>- Hello, Miss Lubin.</i>
Oh, hello there.

<i>Just have a seat.</i>
<i>We'll be with you soon, okay?</i>

<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

How's it going?

Get off.

Get off.

Heel.

Heel!

Got any suggestions?

Oh, what?

You got any suggestions?
Yeah, kick his balls.

Kick his balls.

Yeah, but I don't wanna destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

Don't worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.

If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly,
I'd never get anything done.

But he's gotta be close
to finishing by now.

Not yet.

Here comes the lipstick.

Mrs. Lubin?
We're ready for you now.

Okay. Come on, Arthur.

I feel so used.

Thanks for your help.
For, at least, your good intentions.

I recognize you.
Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

No, not from high school.
From TV.

Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?
Yeah.

Are you
really retarded?

No, I'm not.

Cool.

Great job, man. I mean,
I thought you were really retarded.

You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

If there was some
sort of retarded Oscar...

you would win like
hands down, kick his ass.

Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

I have to fill out
this form though, so...

Right on.
Thanks.

My cousin's an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.

Doubt you've ever
heard of him.

He was, like, on <i>Xena</i> once as a gnome
or something. That's really cool though.

Thanks.

Oh, my God.

That scene.
That last scene...

where you give the speech
to the whole stadium...

and your dad... oh, your dad
gives you the thumbs up.

Aw. That was, like...

That was emotional.

So, you got
anything else coming out?

No. You know,
I'm auditioning...

I can't believe
you're not really retarded.

I mean, Jake's not
a very good actor.

You can't really tell on <i>Xena</i>
'cause he's in the hairy gnome suit...

but when we were little, he used to
put on these really, really low-budge...

renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
musicals in our attic.

<i>And they were awful!</i>

Like, so bad.

It sucks, though, because there's not
that much work for little people, you know?

<i>Anyway, I'm talking too much.</i>

I'll just...
You got to fill out your forms.

What are you
listening to?

The Shins.

You know them?
No.

You gotta hear this one song.
It'll change your life. I swear.

Oh, I'm sorry. You have to...
You gotta fill out your forms.

Conundrum.
Think you could, uh...

maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
I think I can handle it.

Yeah? Okay.

It's good.
I like it.

So, what are you here for?
What are you here for?

Waiting for a friend. You?

I, uh...

Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I'm sorry.

I am so nosy. I didn't...
I didn't mean to be. I'm sorry.

No, I just... I get these headaches.
I just want to have it checked out.

Cool.

<i>- Andrew Largeman?</i>
Yes.

We're ready for you now.
Oh, okay.

Thank you. Nice meeting you.
You didn't. I'm Sam.

Andrew.

Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.

Thanks.

Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

Mr. Andrew Largeman?
Yes, hi.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
What?

Just kidding.
How would I know that? Uh...

<i>I'm Dr. Cohen.</i>

What can we do
for you today, Andrew.

Um, I've been getting these
really intense headaches.

<i>Um, they last for</i>
<i>like a split second.</i>

It's like lightning, like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

Lithium?

How long have you been
on the lithium?

Um, I've been on some form of it
since I was 10 or so.

And the Paxil,
Zoloft, Celexa...

Depakote...

did they, uh,
help you at all?

No.

I mean,
I don't know. Uh...

It's recently occurred to me I might not
even have a problem.

Only, I'd never know it because as far back
as I can remember, I've been medicated.

<i>I left them</i>
<i>in L.A. Though.</i>

<i>This is, uh, the first time I haven't had</i>
<i>medicine in my body for... a long time.</i>

<i>You know that stuff will</i>
<i>leave your body pretty fast.</i>

I can write you a prescription.
Actually, I was thinking about
taking a little vacation.

Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

Uh, well,
my psychiatrist is my dad.

Yeah. So I think he'd
prefer me to stay on it.

He... likes to think
it makes me happy.

You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things...

when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

<i>Uh...</i>

I found my ex-best friend's
cuff links in my wife's purse.

I couldn't get an erection
for a year and a half...

for example.

Wow. Um...

But I don't really think
that's it because I don't...

I don't really feel like
stressed or anxious at all.

'Cause all the lithium he's had you on.
It's amazing you can even hear me now.

Look, Andrew, uh,
first of all...

I think you do need to find
a psychiatrist that isn't your father.

That's something that should have
been remedied years ago.

He knows better.

And secondly, uh, I'm in
no position to comment on...

whether you should stay on the meds or not
because I don't know your story.

But my opinion,
since you're paying for it...

<i>is that, yeah, those drugs may help you</i>
<i>as a means to an end...</i>

but sooner or later, if you're not
in some sort of therapy...

whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its little head out of the water.

Are you all right?
Yeah.

Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

Come on.
I'll take a look at you. Come.

I'll need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.

So why were you
really there?

Charging.
I'm a robot.

Do you lie a lot?
What do you consider a lot?

Enough for people
to call you a liar.

People call me lots of things.
Is one of them "liar"?

I could say no, but how would
you know I'm not lyin'?

I guess I could choose
to trust you.

You can do that?
I can try.

Whose bike is that?

It was my grandfather's.

It was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

And I like it.

So this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if I'd like a ride home.

It is?
Yep.

Would you like a ride home?

Fine. But I'm not
getting in that sidecar.

Why not?
Sidecars are for bitches.

Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

Thus, I will ride
on the back.

Whoa.
Hold on tight.

Okay. Holdin'.

My hair is blowin'
in the wind.

What, are you
like a hang glider?

My boyfriend was gonna
pick me up so I brought it.

But then he couldn't.
What does he have? One of those tandem things?

No. He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

But what kind of helmet is that?
You can wear it on a bike.

Anyway, how's your head?
I should live through the day.

Cool.
Make a right here.

Are you doing
anything right now?

Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
I know this guy, Jesse.

He bought this mansion
that's right up here...

and he wants me
to come visit him.

But I don't want to stay very long.
I was thinking, like if you came too...

I could just say I have to take you home
when I'm ready to go.

Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

I know.
"Nice to meet you. Can I use you?"

No.
It's the Hollywood in you, I guess.

No. Come on.
It's not like that. It'll be fun.

I'll tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.

Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

And then I'll be like, "Oh, I got to
take her home." And then we'll go.

Can we have
code names too?

If you want.

Okay. But don't try
and like kidnap me or anything...

'cause my step-uncle's a bounty hunter
and he could have you tracked and killed.

You're such a liar.

Whoo!

Okay. You ready?

I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
you've ever brought home?

No. But, um...

I lied to you before when I told you
my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

He doesn't drive a bike?
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

But, you know,
he might drive a Ninja.

Wherever he is.
Wow. We're off to a great start.

Okay. So...
So sometimes I lie.

I mean,
I'm weird, man.

About random stuff too.
I don't even know why I do it.

It's like...
It's like a tic.

I mean, sometimes I hear myself
say something, and then I think...

"Wow, that wasn't even
remotely true."

So how do people know
what's real?

Well, I always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

Can you trust that?

Open the door.

Okay.

Okay.

Kevin, down.
Mom!

Come on. Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.

Mom!

All right! Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?

Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

Kevin!
Get off!

<i>I'm so sorry. We just don't have</i>
<i>the time to train them.</i>

Who's got the time
to train them?

Mom, this is Andrew.
Welcome.

Welcome.
I'm sorry the place is a wreck.

<i>Honey, I asked you to get</i>
<i>the metal wheel out of the hamster cage.</i>

I forgot.
Well, you forgot and now Jelly's dead.

Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.

We have to get
the only hamsters on planet Earth...

<i>who can't figure out</i>
<i>a stupid hamster wheel.</i>

There's a tin box
on the kitchen counter.

You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.

It's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

Andrew.
Very nice to meet you.

Samatha, put the clothes
in the dryer and buryJelly.

So this is it.

It's nice.
No, it's not.

Don't say that just 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

I'm not. I'm not.
It's... It's very cozy.

You guys are a little early
on the tree though.

<i>Yeah, we never got around to taking it down.</i>
<i>When it got to be fall again...</i>

we figured,
"Just leave it up."

Oh, my God. You're totally freaked out.
You're totally freaked out right now.

You, like, can't wait to leave.
I'm not. I'm not. I like it.

It's very nice.
Well, you wanna see my room?

Sure.

Hey.
Hey.

Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

Hi. It's very nice to meet you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

I'm sorry about Jelly.
Oh, that's okay.

I saved some mac and cheese for you.
It's in the fridge.

Thank you.

Anyway, I'm late for class.
It's nice meeting you.

Very nice to meet you.
See you later.

So here we are.

It's nothing fancy,
but you know... What?

Uh, it's... Titembay, right?

Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

You're running for the door. It's okay.
You can go. Don't feel bad. It's really...

Stop doing that.
What?

The whole thing you just did. I wanna be here.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be.

Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours. Okay?

Okay.

So, Titembay.

Yeah, he's my brother.
Is he adopted or...

Kind of. My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers like years ago.

One of those "For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.

Where she's like, "How can you
just sit there and not help the children?"

And we couldn't. We just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

So we start sending him like
pictures and letters and stuff for years...

<i>but then I got really into ice-skating,</i>
<i>so we sort of forgot about him.</i>

Then one day we get this phone call
and it's Titembay.

And he's at the dry cleaners
around the corner.

And he's like, "I'm at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms...

but I'm used to living with my tribe
so I'd rather live with a family."

And he's been living
with us ever since.

Wow.

Yeah. I know.
He's the most amazing guy.

You gotta hear his stories. He struggled
through so much because he wanted to learn.

When I think of what
he's accomplished, I just...

I just feel,
like, lazy. You know?

He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,
and when he was a baby...

he was one of those kids with,
like, the flies all over his face.

Wow.

I mean,
i-it's a crazy story.

Yeah, I know. I mean, that's a true story.
I am not that good.

This is Tickle.

What is Tickle?
Tickle's my favorite thing in the whole world.

It's all that's left
of Nanny, my blanket.

Tickle's all that remains.
Mm-hmm.

Was there like a hurricane or something?
Shut up.

No, I mean, I've had this
since I was a baby.

It's what they brought me home
in from the hospital.

It's like the Wailing Wall.
What?

Uh, the Wailing Wall
is like this, uh...

It's like the most holy place
forJews to go and pray in Israel.

It's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

So you're like
reallyJewish.

What?
You are, aren't you?

You are.
No, I'm not.

L-I'm Jewish,
but I'm not reallyJewish.

I don't do anything Jewish.
I don't go to temple or anything.

But I don't know anyJews
that go to temple.

The Jews I know,
they go on one day.

It's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
Okay.

Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls...

so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent...

they can actually make the room
big enough to hold everyone?

I don't really
believe in God.

Just Tickle.
Oh, I believe in Tickle.

We're not gonna make out or anything.
What?

I'm sorry.
I just totally ruined that moment, didn't I?

No, no.
It's just that we're not gonna make out, okay?

Oh, no, I hadn't planned on trying...
Oh, my...

I am so lame.
That was like really... I am...

I'm sorry.
Forget I just said that. I am...

That was dumb. And...

You know what I do
when I feel completely unoriginal?
What?

I make a noise or I do something
that no one has ever done before.

And then I can feel unique again
even if it's only for like a second.

So, no one's
ever done that?

No, not in this spot. No. You just witnessed
a completely original moment in history.

It's refreshing. You should try it.
Oh, no. Thanks.

No, come on.
I think that was good enough for both of us.

Come on.
What are you, shy?

<i>This is your one opportunity</i>
<i>to do something...</i>

that no one has done before and that no one
will copy again throughout human existence.

A-And if nothing else, you'll be remembered
as the one guy who ever did this.

This one thing.

Uh...

How was that?

Oh, I've done
that one before.

So, uh...

So, uh...

I gotta go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

Wanna help? Hmm?

Wow.
Yeah.

I mean, this is, uh...
I know.

<i>It's not that we're bad</i>
<i>pet owners or anything.</i>

It's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

Besides,
a lot of these are fish.

After you.

All right.

Sit down.

What are you
thinking about?

Now?
Yeah.

Right now?
Yeah.

Right now, I was thinking I've been
going to a lot of these things lately.

What, dates?
Not dates.

Is this a date?
This isn't a date.

Funerals.

Why? Who else died?

Oh, uh...

That's why I'm home actually. I guess
I haven't even told you that yet. Um...

My mom just died.

God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

My mom just died.
And, uh...

Yeah, that's why I'm home.

I'm so sorry.

God, I'm so sorry.

<i>And here I am, like, putting you</i>
<i>through another one of these.</i>

<i>Not that Jelly's like</i>
<i>anywhere near your mom's.</i>

I mean,
we loved Jelly but...

I'm so sorry.

No, it's okay.
It's all right.

I'm all right with it.

Anyway, I think it's
what she wanted, so...

How'd she die?

She drowned actually.

Yeah, my, uh...
My mother was a paraplegic.

She was in a wheelchair
so she, uh...

<i>You know, and, uh...</i>

I guess she was
taking a bath...

and she must have
slipped or something.

That's what they say.
I don't... I don't know. But...

needless to say,
she drowned and...

that's how she...
sh-she died.

When?

This was, uh...

Sunday.

Oh, my God.

Why are <i>you</i> crying?

I don't know.
I'm sorry.

Because... I'm not
usually like this.

It's just like...
It's just so sad.

You know, it's like...

It's so tragic, isn't it?
It is. It's like...

It's like real life
tragedy or something.

Anyway, let's change
the subject, okay?

Let's really bring
the focus back toJelly...

'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died...

when you're in the act of
burying a close friend?

Well, what should we do?
I don't know. I've only been
to one of these things.

You appear to be
the expert.

Well, we usually
say something.

Okay, uh,
I'll go first. Um...

Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what I hear, you were a good pet.

Little trouble with the wheel but...
That's not funny.

Jelly, you were
a great pet.

I'm sorry I forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

I'm so, so sorry
about that.

Good-bye.

I hope that you liked me.

Holy shit! You scared
the shit out of me.

Why are you always doing that?
I haven't seen you in a while.

I know. I've been catching up
with people around here.

Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.

Yeah, I think I'm starting
to figure that out myself.

When are you thinking of leaving?
<i>- Uh, probably tomorrow.</i>

Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff
I got to take care of in L.A.

<i>- Probably have to find a newjob, so...</i>
We need to talk.

Yeah, uh, how?
I mean, when?

What are you
doing... now?

Uh, now's not so good. I told my friend Mark
I was gonna meet up with him.

But how about, uh,
like later tonight?

Okay. Then we'll talk.
Yeah.

We owe that
to each other.

Yeah.

We owe it to her.

Yeah.

Good.

Sorry I scared you.

<i>How could you</i>
<i>leave all that lithium?</i>

<i>I was totally going to</i>
<i>hit you up for some, man.</i>

<i>This fucking guy.</i>
<i>I'm glad you're back, man.</i>

<i>This town is so messed up.</i>
<i>Everyone's got their drug of choice.</i>

It's like in <i>Brave New World.</i>
You ever read that book?

Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous... Aldous something.

<i>Aldous, uh...</i>
<i>Anyway...</i>

<i>there's like Alphas and Betas</i>
<i>and Epsilons and all sorts of people.</i>

<i>Huxtable.</i>

Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.

<i>Andrew, would you like</i>
<i>to see Sam's ice-skating tape?</i>

Mom, no.
Absolutely.

She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.

No, no, no, no.
I couldn't have.

Yes, you could have.
Don't blame it on the epilepsy.

You had a gift.
Come on. Let me see it.

<i>Let's just show him the "Florida Stars</i>
<i>of the Ice"opening. The gator costume.</i>

Mom, I'm asking you, seriously.
Come on. Don't be shy. Let me see it!

<i>Oh, she wants you to see it. How could you</i>
<i>not want him to see how talented you are?</i>

Were.
Come on.

Come on.
Ohh!

Honey, what are you doing?
I'm dusting for prints.

Well, could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

I want to show Andrew
Sam's skating.

But someone's been pissing on my GameCube,
and I'm about to close the case.

It wasn't me, Your Honor.

The paw prints
point to a canine. Hmm.

<i>Andrew, come on.</i>
<i>Sit down here on the couch.</i>

I can't believe you're
actually showing him this.

Look, there she is.

You're the alligator?
<i>- You can tell by the hands.</i>

Here comes the double axel.
And...

Land! Oh, I mean, come on. Is she good?
Wow, she's great.

All right.
Wow.

Shut up.
No, I mean, your mom was right. You're really good.

This is awesome, but we gotta go.
All right.

I just wanted to show him how talented you are.
Mom, come on!

My baby!
All right, go on!

Go on. Get away.
Wait a minute.
