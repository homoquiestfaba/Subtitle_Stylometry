What's wrong with the Internet?

I don't know.

Can't sleep?

You got to try.

I found something today.
Yeah? What did you find?

Is it real?

Put that down.
Why?

I am calling you right back.
I'm in the bath.

Man, stop fucking with me.

Stop fucking with me.

They're sending a car right now?

Holy shit.

Sorry.

Should be good now.

Cool.

Uh, y'all got, like,
a track or something

that you want me
to try something over?

Uh, just wait on him.

Okay.

Doesn't it feel like
we're in a movie?

Uh...

I'm Cole.

Thanks for coming tonight.

Yeah, of course.

Uh, do you want to sit down?

Sorry to kind of throw you
on the spot,

if you're nervous or anything.

You can hold this.

It's a quartz.

Helps with concentration, if
you're into that sort of thing.

Are you?
Yes.

You can hold on
to it for right now.

Has all my good energy in it.

I want you to listen
to something.

Cool.

Alright. Okay.

Here, put these in.

Alright.

This is the key
I want to do it in.

For sure.

Oh, no, you can
do it right here.

You don't want me
to bring the mic over?

No.

Don't you want me
to sing into it?

I want it to sound like far.

Away from everything.

You know what I mean?

Like, everything's upside down.

Upside down?

Everything's upside down.

â™ª I'll seek you out â™ª

â™ª Flay you alive â™ª

â™ª One more word,
and you won't survive â™ª

â™ª And I'm not scared â™ª

â™ª Of your stolen power â™ª

â™ª See right through you
any hour â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your strain â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your stain â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your strain â™ª

Is that it?
Yep, that's all we need.

Thank you.

Car should be right outside.
Okay.

Bye.
Bye.

â™ª I'll seek you out â™ª

â™ª Flay you alive â™ª

â™ª One more word,
and you won't survive â™ª

â™ª And I'm not scared â™ª

â™ª Of your stolen power â™ª

â™ª See right through you
any hour â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your strain â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your â™ª

I am an asshole.

I am an asshole.

I am an asshole.

Fuck.

What the fuck?

Ohhhhh.

Hi.

What are you doing?

Why is that weird
that I would be calling?

Like, we should still obviously
be able to talk.

Who are you in New York with?

Why did you even go
to New York again?

Right. Right. I love Ellen.

Aaah!

Do you know when you're
coming back from New York?

I mean, I don't know.
I was just asking.

Obviously, I'm spending time
with Rosie.

Yeah, she's just
been in her room.

No, I am not on anything.

I'm not on anything.

Is there any way that
when you can come back, I...

Okay.

â™ª See right through you â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª Pain â™ª

Ilana, what's a good happy song?

â™ª I won't soothe â™ª
I don't know.

Not everybody cares
about your theories, bro.

What's your theory?

See, she cares.

My theory is most happy songs,
they're actually sad as fuck.

People just too stupid
to get it.

Okay. For example?

For example...

Pharrell's song "Happy",
okay, that song is played

at all the kids'
birthday parties, you know?

Mm-hmm.
But the truth is

when the chorus comes in,
it sounds like a bunch of moms

on speed trying to convince
themselves or something.

For real.

Hey, man, that song made money.

I'm not saying
it's not a great song, dude.

I'm just saying it sounds like

somebody putting a gun
to your head

and telling you to be happy.
Yeah.

Cole! Cole!
Right here!

What happened
with you and Mae, huh?

Cole!

Cole, do you have any comments?
Cole!

Cole, do you have any comment
about you and Mae?

How is Lena?

Who?

The girl, the singer.

Who?

The girl who we had
come in to the studio.

What girl?

For real?

The girl, she sat
next to you by the piano

like an hour ago.

We brought her in.

Yeah, she was a good singer.

What the fuck?

What?

Are you high?

Hey, Cole.

Hi, my little rose.

What are you doing?

I'm swimming.

You want to swim?

Okay.
Okay.

Rosie, you need to
come back to bed.

Sorry, Cole.
What?

No.

It's alright.

Good night, Cassidy.

Why do you always call me Cole
and not Daddy?

Because you told me
to call you Cole.

Did I?

Cassidy, how's the guest house?

I had it cleaned before
you guys came.

It's been fine.
It's fine?

Yeah.
Okay.

Let me know if
you need anything.

Okay. Thank you.

I think Cole's falling asleep.

I'm not falling asleep.

Come on, back to bed.

Who's going to put Cole to bed?

I will. I got it.

Let's go, lady.

You don't want to be tired when
Mommy comes back.

Good night.
Isn't it great

that you got to spend
so much time

with Cole while you were here?

I did?

Night, Cole!

I love you, princess.

Alright, up.

Cole, get out.

What?
Get out of the pool.

No.
Look at me.

Get out of the fucking pool.

Do you want help?

I got it.
Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Gross.

You should go.

It's almost 2:00 a.m.

What the fuck, Cole?

Okay, I'm picking you up
tomorrow at noon.

"Thank you, Ilana."

Comment if you know
what this one is.

Hey.
Hello.

Um, come in.

Thanks.

Nice.

Thanks.

It's a rental.
It's not permanent.

Nothing is, right?

Right. Um, you want me
to take your coat?

In a minute.

I was just in this neighborhood.

For real? When?

Few hours ago.
God damn. Okay.

Visiting who?
Some movie producer.

Which one?

What's the difference, right?

Right.

I thought Bub said
you were bringing, um...

Oh.

Thanks.

She didn't forget the box.

Um, you want some?

I'm good.

For real? You don't want
like a bump or nothing.

Would it make you
feel better if I did?

Uh, nah, I just...

I'm just trying to be
a good host.

I appreciate it.

Is this for real?

Is what for real?

This picture.

Uh, yeah.

She's your wife?

Was my wife.

We got a kid together,
but we're not together.

Damn.

She's so beautiful.

Yeah.

This feel good?

Yeah.

Didn't take long.

Oh, no, that... That's not me.

That's my crystal.

Sorry.
Yeah, that's pretty insulting.

I'm a lot bigger than this.

This is like
one and a half inches.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

Damn.

Damn.

Uh, what is that?
It's, uh, it's my crystal.

It's a quartz.

You carry it around with you?

For like five years, yeah.

Got all my energy in it,
everything I've been through.

Feels like it kind of
stores all of it

and channels other things.

Helps me manifest, you know?

Can I see it?

Um...

yeah, you can like look at it.

It's...

It's, you know... but fuck that.

Come on.

You want me to do
something or not?

Okay.

Hello.

<i>Hey, buddy.
Sleeping in?</i>

<i>No worries.
I got Dougie here, too.</i>

<i>What's up, broseff?</i>

Don't call me that.

<i>Big day today.
Radio interview with Anne.</i>

<i>And a meeting with our sponsor.</i>

<i>I think it's over breakfast.</i>

Sponsor?

<i>The corporate sponsor
for the tour.</i>

<i>The guys from Glows, remember?</i>

<i>They're dumping
shit loads of money into that,</i>

<i>so it's going to be a little
bit of a dog and pony show.</i>

<i>We heard that girl Lisa
is going to be a star.</i>

What?
<i>- Lisa?</i>

<i>- Lena.
Lena.</i>

<i>We should really jump on that.
Do you like her?</i>

<i>Alright, we got to jump,
but we'll totally talk to her.</i>

<i>Remember, 24/7, we got you.</i>

<i>We'll check in
after your meetings.</i>

Alright.

Fuckin' douchbags.

Oh, no.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Fuck.

Oh, my God.

No, no, no, no.

Fuck!

Rosie?

Cassidy?

Nice million-dollar view.

So much shit in the air.

So, how's it going?

I'm working on it.

Yeah? Well, you got anything
I can listen to?

I'm working on it.

Should I come down to the studio
and listen to something?

I'm working on it.

Alright.

Look, man, we're just...

just trying to help.

Thanks.
Come on, Cole.

We got you the nicest
recording studio in Los Angeles.

Frank fucking Sinatra recorded

"Strangers in the Night" there,
for Christ's sake.

I didn't ask for it, man.

I know you didn't
ask for it, man.

But we got it for you anyway.

Alright?

Yeah.

Your nose is bleeding.

For real?

No.

Fuckin' asshole.

You know, the other day,
I was trying to get my kid

to put down his phone

because it's like
a fucking constant now.

Then I actually offered to
pay him to put it down.

And as I was hearing myself
say it, I thought,

what a fucking asshole
I've become.

I mean, who am I? Right?

And he says to me, "How much?"

I don't know, son. Five bucks.

He says, "Make it $20."

Alright. You got a deal.

I paid him.

Just like I'm paying you.

So I'll see you down
at the fucking studio.

You got it?

You look fresh.

I've been here for an hour.

I said noon.
No, you didn't.

Uh, yeah, I did.

When's the last time
you were up before then?

When's the last time you decided
to stop giving me shit?

I'm not giving you shit.
Well, you are kind of.

That's why I'm confused.

So it makes me
ask this question.

Um, am I your boss?

Like with your words,
like, tell me.

I want to know, am I your boss?

Yeah.
Yeah.

So maybe you can act
more like an employee

and do your fucking job
so I'm not late.

Or else, you can go work
at Burger King. Cool?

Yep.

Cool.

Where's Rosie?

She went home.

Why is that?

Uh, she went home because
she was here for two days

and they never saw you
and Mae gets custody.

Uh...

I asked about Rose. I don't need
to hear the other name.

You got me?

Okay.
Okay.

Because she can stay
in New York for the rest

of her fucking life
for all I care.

Yep.
I don't care.

Yes, Cole, okay.
Cool.

I'm ready.
Okay. You ready?

Yeah.
Let's go.

Let's do it.

Hey, Ilana.

What?

I'm sorry.

It's fine.

I just feel bad about Rosie.

I... I don't get why
I act like this.

Maybe you could try a little
harder when she's around.

Can we stop and get a new phone?
Mine's gone.

How?

I threw it.

You threw it where?

If I knew where,
then we wouldn't need

to find a new phone, would we?

Hope I'm not disturbing.

Not at all.
I'm Eve, Anne's assistant.

Ilana.

Hey.
Hi.

I just want to say
what a huge fan I am.

I've been looking forward
to this interview for forever.

That's so nice.
Yeah. Thanks.

So if you need anything, really,
just let me know

and I'll get it for you.

I'll take a phone.

Yeah, like, a new phone.

'Cause I...

Uh, I don't... I...

I was thinking more...
Is Anne ready for us?

Uh, yeah.

Cool. Let's do it.

Just this way.
Come on, Cole.

Just this way.

Cole.

Hi, Cole. Welcome.
Hi.

Thank you for coming.
Yeah, thanks for having me.

Oh, what, uh,
why are the cameras there?

Oh, we're doing a live stream.

Web on demand. Live stream.
It's going be great.

Did... oh, did...
Um, with our interview?

Yeah. Did they not tell you?

No. They didn't tell me.

I... I tell you what.

Hair and makeup
will be super quick.

Not a problem.

I'mma just... give me
one minute, please.

Yeah, take your time.
Take your time. No rush.

I told you.
No, you didn't tell me.

I did.

No, you didn't say
it was on camera.

You knew. I told you.

I... I hate when
you make excuses.

It's so fucking annoying.
I'm not making excuses.

I'm just telling you.

Telling me what, though?

I told you.

You didn't tell me shit, Ilana.
Stop fucking lying!

I swear to God
I will fucking fire you.

Stop. People are watching.

I don't give a fuck
if anyone's watching!

Let 'em watch!

You do your job so great,
they should see.

Fuck you, dude.
You're such a fucking bitch.

Call me a bitch again,
and you will be fired.

Bitch. You're a fuckin' bitch.

What do you want me
to do next for you?

Wipe your fucking ass?
Just do your fuckin' job!

I am doing my fucking job!
Babysitting you day and night,

you fucking douche bag!

God, I hate you!

You're fired! Fuck you!
Really? Really?

How you gonna get home, Cole?
Who's gonna drive you?

Uber! Duh!
You can't!

You don't have a phone!
Who's gonna get you a new phone?

My new assistant!
Good!

Well, make sure you tell her
where all the fucking pills

are stashed so you don't
freak out on her when you

can't find them.
Shut the fuck up!

Shut the fuck up!
Make sure she can fish you out

of the fucking pool...
Fuck you!

...when you're
fucking passed out!

Fuck you!
Tell her to hold your

fucking hand when you have
to do fucking anything!

It's like the part, I just don't
want like the part in my hair.

Can...

He, um...

he likes it a little
messier in the front.

Maybe if you could get some...
Some product like, uh...

Clay or something.

The clay, like the molding wax.

I like this.

You should let them
see your eyes.

Hello!

Hello, TV,
I have an album coming out.

I don't want to do this one.

Need help?

Yeah.
Okay.

I don't want to get your hair.

Ah.
Don't move.

Okay.

You look good.

And I don't deserve you.

Who inspires you?

What did you say?
Who inspires you?

Um...
Doesn't have to be music.

Yeah, well,
sometimes it's not music.

A lot of times it is,
but sometimes it might be like,

you know, if I had my shoes off
and I was feeling this rug,

I'd be like,
"Oh, man, we need merch

that makes me feel
the way this rug feels.

Like, we need a sweater
with this material on it.

Maybe we should just
sit down on the floor

and do this.

Or it's like architecture
or something like that,

or it's like the way
the fuckin' air smells

when you're driving through
Joshua Tree in the desert

high on mushrooms or something,
and you're like,

"Whoa, there needs to be
a song for this."

Like, music is like...
It's like a bookmark.

You can always turn back
and remember that chapter

when you hear a certain thing
that triggers it.

Give... give me a time
and place.

What's som... what's...

What do you remember
hearing somewhere that...

Oh, like 10 years old,
the first Blink 182 album

when I heard
"What's My Age Again?"

And we were just like...

Where did you hear it?

Oh, we had waited in line
at a store to get the CD,

and we came back, and we all had
to share the CD player.

So each of us got, you know,

to listen to the album
all the way through.

And the other group of kids

would be playing like Halo,
I think.

And so we'd each get our like

45 minutes or hour,
however long the album was,

to just listen to it, and I
remember hearing it, and like,

yeah, I was like, "Oh, my God."

Or like the first 50 Cent album,

when 50 Cent
dropped that first album,

we were all on the school bus,

and everyone had to have like...
We... we wanted it...

We all wanted to listen
to it at the same time so bad

we broke the headphones in half.

This is back when headphones
still connected.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
each person got an ear.

And so we each would, like,
take it and put it in their ear

so you could listen,
and we were like,

"Oh, my God, 50 Cent's so good."

Do you...
Do you think rock stars,

rap stars in general
are special people?

No. I mean,
there's something about

it that's divine.

Mm-hmm.
Because what you say is able

to reach so many
and influence so many.

But there's also something
about it that's sacrificial.

Like how when the Mayans used to
choose the baby that they would,

you know, kind of lulled with
with acceptance and worship,

but then sacrifice them, right?

The same people that loved them
and made them feel special

were the same ones
that threw them

to these underwater caverns that
were like... that became...

But they displayed them first.
Yeah.

They held them up
for everyone to see.

Said, "This is our chosen one."

Do you think performers,
artists are

always on display?

Do you want to keep
talking or...

Do you need...
Do you need to take a minute?

I'm sorry.

Cole!

Cole!

I'm against
Shirley Temple shaming.

Also, someone carved
a dick right here.

Inappropriate.

Excuse me.
Why two registers?

Computer one sucks.
This is really cool.

Hello.

Thought we agreed just one.

Here we are. Just one.

Where were you?

I was getting food.

You want a drink?

You got a lunch meeting.

Negative.

What do you mean negative?

I mean no.

As in I won't be there.

As in missing in action.
As in...

Cole.

I'm not going to do
this with you.

Let's just stay.

We're not saying.
Absolutely are.

Can I get one more, please?
He's not gonna have one more.

I'm not gonna sit here
and drink with you

and then miss your meeting
because when you do

miss your meeting
and people are pissed,

you're just going
to take it out on me.

So no.

Finish your drink,
and then we're going.

Can I please have one more?

Come on. No more.

I'm leaving.
You're done.

I'm not leaving.

Okay, but that's it.

â™ª Left wing skin on
the right wing leather â™ª

Hey, Cole. How you doing?
Andrew.

Hi.
This is Tanya.

Great to meet you, Cole.

We do think being
a brand ambassador with clothes

would be a perfect fit for you.

Irreverent, cool.

And the team
has been working hard

to make sure the brand enhances
the performances

with digital signage,
language, social interaction.

Diet Coke.

Nasty habit.

And Cutty rocks.

You know whose
favorite drink was Cutty?

Nope.
Sam Cooke.

No shit.
What I read.

Really?
Yeah.

So, um, I'm not sure if
Danie told you the latest news.

Um...
But the tour is not going to be

a lot of stadiums...
â™ª And I'm looking' â™ª

coverage challenges, but it's
nothing we can't adapt to.

â™ª One day â™ª
Yeah, for the movie.

â™ª Where my baby â™ª
The movie,

the live-streaming event...
â™ª Can be found â™ª

Okay, ready?

Alright. Cool, cool.

Thanks for the pizza.

Fuck you, man.

Yo, I'm about to get

Yeah, I'm about to go pick up
my sister and shit.

Hey, we got a slap.
It's 2:00 in the morning.

Nah, I'm about to...
I'm about to go

pick my sister up
and bust a quick move and shit.

Y'all wouldn't be easy.

Cool gang.
No, we good.

Well, look, um, real shit,
I ain't gonna lie.

You should be
a little more humble.

Your fans, bro, without your
fans, there's no you, bro.

So could be in that life
position one day, bro.

So, be blessed, bro.

Yo.

What the fuck?
I didn't say anything.

You could be a little...
A little nicer.

Mmm, got my pizza.

That was me?

You could be nicer.

Fuck that pizza!

Okay.

What are you waiting for,
an invitation?

Get in here, rock star.
You ready?

Yep.
Let's go.

You good?

You hanging inside, or...?

No, why would I hang with them
when I can hang with you?

Hang tight.

Wait. Can you leave the keys
so I can listen to music?

Absolutely not. Never again.

Wow.

Nice try.
Wow.

That's fucked up.

How you doing?

You know what happened there?

Yeah. A couple got shot up.

For real?

Yeah, man, by their kid.

Damn.

They were just watching fucking
Netflix or some shit.

Come on.

You know,
everybody's got a gun now.

Got to be careful.

I found something.

I found something today.

I found something.
I found something today.

I found something today.

I'm... I'm not his mom.
Like I can't...

You know what I mean?
Like, I can only do my job.

And my job is a certain thing.

Your job is to drive him home
when he finishes work.

So you're not doing
your fucking job.

I can't watch him
every minute, Ray.

I would... I would fucking
love to, but I can't.

He's a fucking adult man, dude.

All I'm saying is just
please keep that spiky-haired

fucking cunt away from him.

â™ª I've never known
a girl like you before â™ª

â™ª Before, before â™ª

â™ª I never met a girl
like you before â™ª

â™ª You before, you before â™ª

â™ª You give me just a taste
so I want more â™ª

â™ª Want more, want more â™ª

Thanks, Vicky.

â™ª Now my hands are bleeding â™ª
Alright, boy.

Ready?
Yeah.

Let's go.

â™ª You got me crawling,
crawling on the floor â™ª

â™ª I've never known a girl
like you before â™ª

â™ª You made me acknowledge
the devil in me â™ª

â™ª I hope to God â™ª

Doctor told me

one more year of this
and I have a hole in my septum.

What?
Isn't that some shit?

He said it's... what's the C?
Oh, corroded. My septum.

Then maybe this is not something

you want to be doing
right now, Cole.

He said a year, so we got
364 more days.

11 months.
Exactly.

11 months, we're good.

We'll give it an extra
bit of time.

I don't think he was accounting
for me doing it every day.

So we really have a lot of time.

You're not going
to do it every day.

I mean...
I canceled the tour.

I'm stuck here.

But you can maybe travel,
go some place.

You've been
all around the world.

You didn't see one place
where you went,

"Shit, I can just live here
and live a normal life."

Never left the bus.

Then he... fuck.

Oh, I'm too drunk. Can you...

Yeah.

I don't know.
I think travel is good.

When I was growing up
thinking about Hollywood, L.A.,

I was like, "It's gonna be

bright, light,
friendly and fun."

I don't know. This is not
exactly how I pictured it.

You know?

It's not?
Not exactly.

Doing coke
in a strip club, fuck!

I mean, it could be worse.

I don't know, I think, like,
just sometimes I spend time

imagining living
on a farm somewhere.

I've spent the night
in this place before.

A whole night?

With a woman?
No, no.

Probably right here.
They woke me up.

They're like, "It's 11:00 in
the fucking morning, get out."

Oh!
What?

No.
Hey, I paid for it.

Come on. Cole!

Good God. My God.

Such an ass.
Oh, my God.

â™ª Girl like you before â™ª

â™ª Never, never â™ª

â™ª Never, never, never â™ª

â™ª I've never known
a girl like you before â™ª

Oh, I can't feel...

â™ª Okay â™ª

Hello.

What the fuck?

Bitch.

Hey!

Hey!

Ah! Fuck!

Have a good night!

Get the fuck out of here.

Fuck.

Here. Drink this.

Oh, thank God.

That's so good.

Oh, what's that smell?

Oh.

Yeah. You puked a lot.

Oh, thank God.

Thank God.

Oh.
Yeah.

Oh. Oh.

Okay. Alright.

Okay.

Come on.

Yeah.

You okay? You okay?

You gonna puke?

I just want...

Do you need...
Oh, my God.

I need to find my crystal.

Okay.

And I need new...

And I need new clothes.

Hey.

Yeah.
You good?

I feel like shit.

She just came in.
Who?

I didn't know what
to tell her, bro.

So I just asked her
if she wanted to wait.

Who?

Okay.

Why you laughing?
Tell me now.

Um, I went on a date.

With who?

Just some guy
that I met on Tinder.

Tinder.
And I am just like, you know...

Wow, Tinder.
What the fuck else

am I gonna... when do I have
time to meet anybody?

Ilana's on Tinder?
Not anymore. Not after that.

After what? What happened?

After you met your
perfect date on Tinder.

I don't know.
He's just like Italian.

He was, like,
really into, like, telling me...

I thought you liked Italians.

I don't... I mean,
I don't... I'll take anything

at this point.

Yo. What?
He was like, I said something

that I guess wasn't that...
I was like reaching

in conversation.

It wasn't that deep
or something.

And he was like, "You know..."

But you know you like
to talk about some wild shit.

So what did you say?
I didn't say any...

It was so mundane
because I thought

he was so boring,
and he was like,

"You know, I really like
really intellectual people."

Right.
Like, as if to say

I'm a fucking idiot.

So I was just like,
"Oh, okay, cool."

You know? So, no, I'm done.
I'm done.

So he hates you.
That went bad.

I don't know.
Like, he still wanted to...

But I didn't. Anyway.
Yeah, it sucks.

Well, I still got faith in you.
How's your...

What's her name?

Oh, Catherine.
Oh, she's gone.

Gone?
She's long gone.

Why?
I don't even like

thinking about her
no more, like...

Why?
I like my drums

better than her.

I thought you were, like,
hooking up

with her last week still.

She was worthless.

Okay.

Like, I'm just...

I found something today.

I found something today.

I went to a house last night.

Oh, yeah. What house?

A house where
a kid killed his parents.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

I was waiting in the car.

And I looked over,
and there was this

caution tape around this house.

Giant black palm tree over it.

It was like drawing me to it.

Like I needed to know something
that was going on inside.

So I...

went inside, and I saw
where they were killed.

Cole, you could get into...

I went into this kid's room,
right?

It was the most normal room,
like games and... and a bed

and...

And there was a poster.

Okay.

I was on the poster.

You're on a million posters.

Not of kids that
murder their parents.

Hey.
Hey.

Nice to be back.

Is it?

Sure.

You ever swim?

Sometimes.

Why? You want to?

Yeah, maybe.

Okay. I'll go try and find
a swimsuit for you or something.

Why would I need one of those?

Right.

You can start with your coat.

Um...

I have something for you.

I don't know why I took it.

I just needed something,
I guess.

Yeah.

I, uh... I can feel that.

You want to cut something up?

Cool. You want some?

Sure.

You know, your crystal
didn't really work.

That's funny.

Um, alright, well, one for me.

And one for you.

So, did you get
any music in here?

No.

Really?

Really.

Oh.

I could play some
on my phone or something.

Okay.

What do you want to hear?

One of your songs.

Uh, absolutely not,
but I can find something.

I was expecting something
a little different.

What, you don't like this?

â™ª And playin' â™ª

It's fine.

Just don't know
how to dance to this.

â™ª ...it seems â™ª

â™ª You don't remember my name â™ª

â™ª But I was with you â™ª

â™ª Through dark
and stormy weather â™ª

â™ª I loved you then â™ª

Fuck it.

â™ª I love you now â™ª

â™ª Whoa, my darling,
I'll love you forever â™ª

â™ª Baby â™ª

â™ª I was your true love â™ª

â™ª Always, always by your side â™ª

â™ª Forsaking all others â™ª

â™ª And swallowing my pride â™ª

â™ª But you were blind â™ª

â™ª With a wandering heart â™ª

â™ª And just like the wind â™ª

â™ª It blew us apart â™ª

â™ª I, I loved you then â™ª

â™ª I loved you then â™ª

Wow!

â™ª I love you now â™ª

â™ª And, whoa, my darling,
I'll love you forever â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª Whoa, forever â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª Everywhere I walk â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª And to whoever
I might talk to â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª Whoa, I tell 'em that I â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª Whoa, don't you know
that I love you â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª I, I, I, I, I love you â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª Oh, I love you â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª I love everything about you â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

You've been waiting long?

No.

You cool to go to the studio?

Yeah. Did you call Syl?

No. Think I just want to do
some stuff by myself.

Cool.
Cool.

It's all good with you?

What's... What's with the vibe?

What?

What are you talking about?

Did you, like, swallow
your crystal or something?

Man, fuck you.

Did you like that better?
Okay.

Much. Thank you.
You were scaring me.

Maybe I'll drive.

That's a great idea.
Right?

What?

You know what ad libs are?

Yeah.
Do you have any cool ad libs?

Ad libs?
Yeah.

Do you have any cool ad libs?

Like, what's your ad lib
if you were in the studio?

If I was in the studio?
Like your song.

Like, um, your ad libs
on your song, what would it be?

Give me an example of an ad lib.

Like an ad lib, like "Yeah!"

Or like...

Like...

"Whoa, hey!"

Hey!

No, I don't have
the confidence to do that.

Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!

Do you want me to sage you?
Okay.

My crown chakra.

Okay. I'm not 100% sure
where that is, but...

It's on my crown.
Okay.

And then after you do that,
could you open the door

to let all the bad vibes
out because...

Yeah.

â™ª Bury me alive, disappear â™ª

â™ª Chest to my heart,
like a spark does â™ª

â™ª Fireworks on the new year â™ª

â™ª Burning me alive â™ª

â™ª Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah â™ª

â™ª Bury me alive,
disappear on the ground â™ª

â™ª When they found me
before I ever had this career â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

What is it?
What do you need?

Nothing.

What do you want to do?

Nothing. I'm done.

Okay.

Do you want to go somewhere?

No.

I want to go, um,
get ready for Rosie.

Yeah. That sounds really nice.

Do you think Cole's
still sleeping?

You know Cole.

We'll have to wake him up then.

Okay, let's go, cutie.

What song are you singing?
One of Cole's.

Oh, yeah? Of course you are.

I can't wait to show Cole
my new baseball.

Oh, you go show him.

You gonna a give him one?
Yeah.

Wake up, sleepy head!

Cassidy.
Yeah?

Is Cole sleeping?

Oh, my God. Rosie!
Wait.

Stop!
Stop, Rosie, please!

Stop, stop, Rosie, please.
Come with me, please.

Wait! What's wrong with him?
Is he okay?

It's okay.
Just... okay, it's fine.

Everything is fine.

Okay, let's go.

I want you to sit outside
for a minute, okay?

We're just gonna sit.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.

Guys, did you just see that?
I don't know if you did.

They literally just
loaded him in.

Okay, we got more cops, um,
driving in.

But that literally
just happened.

Hey, guys, what happened?

Can you tell us what happened?

Fuckin' kid.

He was just a fuckin' kid.

You want to listen?

Yeah, play it.

â™ª I'll seek you out â™ª

â™ª Flay you alive â™ª

â™ª One more word,
and you won't survive â™ª

â™ª And I'm not scared â™ª

â™ª Of your stolen power â™ª

â™ª See right through you
any hour â™ª

â™ª I didn't leave a letter
on my desk saying goodbye â™ª

â™ª People think I left
even though I'm still here â™ª

â™ª Pressure made its way through
my chest to my heart â™ª

â™ª Like a spark does,
fireworks on the new year â™ª

â™ª Burning me alive,
life imitates art â™ª

â™ª There are flames on my arms,
tattooed right here â™ª

â™ª Bury me alive,
disappear underground â™ª

â™ª Where they found me before
I ever had this career â™ª

â™ª I won't soothe your pain â™ª

â™ª I won't ease your strain â™ª

â™ª I'm staring at a diamond
knowing that they are forever â™ª

â™ª Even if my body is
still around and well â™ª

We love you.

I get goose bumps just
thinking about your voice.

I've seen his goose bumps.
They're kind of gross.

â™ª Know that I'm a monster
like the one under the bed â™ª

â™ª I'm afraid of having kids â™ª

â™ª I'm scared I'll be
just like my parents â™ª

â™ª These were my decisions, now
this cross, I got to wear â™ª

â™ª Self inflicting these
decisions, yeah â™ª

â™ª I can no longer bear it â™ª

â™ª Unh â™ª

You understand
what we're getting at.

You can do anything you want.

And most importantly,
we'll protect you.

Yes. We will protect you.

â™ª I'll seek you out â™ª

â™ª Flay you alive â™ª

â™ª One more word,
and you won't survive â™ª

â™ª And I'm not scared â™ª

â™ª Of your stolen power â™ª

â™ª See right through you
any hour â™ª

â™ª Bleach my hair, mess it up â™ª

â™ª Take my life, dress it up â™ª

â™ª Signed a deal,
I got paper cuts â™ª

â™ª They wanted them,
but they got us â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, uh â™ª
