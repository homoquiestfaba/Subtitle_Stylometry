Melissa!

Melissa where are you?

Melissa I'm giving you
til the count of three

to get down here or
there's gonna be trouble!

One!

Two!

Three, that's it young lady,
when I get my hands on you

you're gonna be

(TENSE MUSIC)
really, really sorry!

Have you seen your daughter?

What has she done now?

I didn't say she'd done anything

I just asked if you'd seen her!

No need to jump down my throat dear,

I've been working in the lab all morning.

The lab.

Why can't you get a normal
job like a real husband?

HUSBAND: This is my job.

WIFE: Oh yeah, how much
money did you make this week?

We don't need the money.
That's not the point!

I'm sick of seeing you around
the house 24 hours a day!

When will I (MUMBLES) once in a while?

Why don't you get away
(DREAMY MUSIC)

for a while, pack a suitcase?

WIFE: And that's another thing!

How come we never go
places like a real family?

HUSBAND: I can't
leave my work right now,

Aw, look at you, you're so cute.

Do you wanna be friends?

We can be friends.

My name is Melissa, and I
think I'll call you Peewee.

(MACHINES HUMMING)
(LIQUID BUBBLING)

What are you doing?

Daddy's working, honey.

Go play.

What kind of work?

Daddy's trying to find a specific ionic

chemical association by which
special cobalt isotope based

nutrients can be suspended
by electrical charges,

so they can be more
readily absorbed through

the walls of polymers.

What does that mean?

It means Daddy's trying
to make things grow bigger.

What for?

Because by the year 2050,

there's gonna be 10 billion
people in this world,

and we have to find a solution
or there all gonna starve.

What's a crab eat?

Um, crabs are omnivorous.

What does that mean?
Stop badgering me,

I'm very busy, why don't you go play

with your dolls or something?

Melissa?
Yes?

Omnivorous means crabs eat anything.

(DOOR THUMPING)



(DOOR CLATTERING)

You still here?

MELISSA: Yes, I (MUMBLES).

Okay, have fun.

(FURTIVE MUSIC)

There you go.


(WET GRINDING)

You really like those berries don't you?

I can get you more.

Daddy grows them on the
weird plant in his lab.

It's a monster, that's what it is!

Really?
There it goes!

Look there it goes!


Aw, it's just a little crab.

Just a little cra...

Did you see it was the
size of a Volkswagen!

Don't exaggerate.
Don't tell me

I'm exaggerating, I know what I saw!

Is this something you cooked up?

What are you talking ab...

In the lab, (STAMMERS)
the crap you're working on,

the growth serum?
Hon, Honey, don't call

my work crap.
You work is crap!

SHELDON: It pays the bills,
it puts food on the table.

I pay the bills!
That's the last

of the berries, the plant's

not growing any more.
That's right!

You're not just living off your wife,

Sorry.
You're living off

your wife's (MUMBLES) and aunt!

(TENSE MUSIC)

You're a strange little
girl, you know that?

Can we go now Uncle
Ray, I need to get home?

RAY: I'm afraid you're
gonna have to stay with me

for a little while, honey.

I need to take care of Peewee.

Who's Peewee?
He's my pet.

RAY: A dog or something?

He's a crab.


Well, crabs are resourceful.

I think he'll be okay
on his own for a while.

We gotta get going.

Hey Sheriff!

Good morning Phil!

I wouldn't call it good when

somebody's goin' 'round killing my stock!

Killing your stock?
Yes, they got Maisee!

Aw, not Maisee!

Tore her up good and
blood all over the place!

And that's not the only thing!

Sounds like some kind of cult activity.

Sonny.
They tore up my barn,

tore the whole back wall out!

You didn't hear anything?

You know how far the
barn is from my house?

They could use dynamite
and I would hear anything!

We need to look into this!

Ya think?

All right Phil, come on.

Let's go take a look
and see what we can see.

(TENSE MUSIC)
Looks like a bulldozer

went through it.
(INSECTS CHIRPING)

Don't know what to make of that.

Some kind of cult thing.

Yeah, one of those bulldozer cults

you keep hearing about.

(WIND HOWLING)
(INSECTS CHIRPING)

(FOREBODING MUSIC)

SONNY: What are you looking it?

RAY: Looks like some sort of track.

SONNY: What kind of track?

Beats the hell out of me.

Looks like someone
used a posthole digger.

Yeah.

Must be one of those
posthole digger cults.

You like giving me a
hard time don't you Ray?

That's Sheriff Ray to you.

Come on.

Let's see where these tracks lead to.

SONNY: See where this
is leading off, don't you?

RAY: Yeah I see.

Well what are you gonna do about it?

Probably just coincidence.

(GUN FIRING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

Melissa!

What the hell do you think you're doing?

I think I'm dealing with
a couple of trespassers!

We're on official
police business, Melissa!

I still got another round in this thing.

Come on Melissa, you're
not gonna shoot anybody.

What do you want?

Somebody, or some thing,

tore up Phil McCory's barn,

and there's some kind of
tracks that lead out here

to your property.

You got any idea what
might be responsible?

We need to check it out.
Not without a warrant.

We don't need no stinking warrant!

These tracks lead right
onto your property,

and we got a legal right to
follow them wherever they go!

Try it.
(GUN CLICKING)

We can get a warrant, Melissa.

Then you better do it.

Come on Sonny.

Are you gonna let
her get away with this?

We are officers of the law dammit!

Let's go!
No!

We don't need a warrant and you know it!

I am searching her property.

RAY: You want an ass full of buckshot?

SONNY: She wouldn't dare.

(GUN FIRING)
Ow, god, shit!

She loaded that thing with rock salt!

Son of a bitch it hurts!

You shouldn't have done that Melissa!

One of these days you're gonna go too far!

One of these days?

Come on let's get you tended to.

No, she shot a damn officer of the law!

I want her arrested!

I am arresting you, you have
the right to remain silent!

So do you, now shut up and let's go!

(TRUCK RUMBLING)

Dammit Ray!
Sheriff Ray.

This has got to stop!

I know she's your niece and
all but she is a public menace!

I'll take care of Melissa.

She shot a damn police officer

in the pursuit of his duties!

Oh you got winged by a
little bit of buckshot.

It hurts!
You know,

for somebody who says he's so tough,

you sure do whine a lot.

I can file a complaint you know!

I can't stop you.


So what next?

Something bothers me about those tracks.

I gotta find out what they are.

I don't buy that posthole digger theory.

We can do a moulage, send the casts off

to the Wildlife Commission.

Hmm.

You know, I don't know why
people say you're so dumb.

Well thank you.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

What the hell is that?

Beats me.

But once I send it out of here,

I'm not gonna worry about it.

Let the whiz kids down
state figure it out.

SONNY: What about Melissa?

What about her?

SONNY: You just gonna do nothing?

How's your leg feeling?

SONNY: My leg's fine.

Then I'm gonna do nothing.

Hello.

So how are you set for white wine?

Actually, I do have this nice little,

California Chardonnay, full
bodied, hint of citrus,

nice (MUMBLES).
Sounds delicious.

Coming right up.

You know this is gonna sound really phony.

But you look very familiar.

Stranger passing through.

Never been here before?

WOMAN: I would have remembered.

Moe Harley.
Jennifer Katsmin.

Katsmin, Katsmin.

Didn't there used to be a family
around here, by that name?

I know who you are!

You're Jennifer Kane!

That's right!

Jennifer Kane!

Lesbian Vampires from Mars (CHUCKLING)!

The Prison!
Tanned Heat!

Guys, guys!

You have me confused with some other

beautiful talented actress.

But if I ever see this
Jennifer Kane woman,

I'll give her your regards.

So Miss uh, Katsmin.

MAN: Aww...

Jennifer Katsmin.

Okay Miss Katsmin, what brings
you to our uh, little town?

Actually, I'm looking for a friend.

MOE: Really, I know
everyone around here.

Do you know Melissa Weber?

I sure as hell do.

That little shit took a
shot at me this afternoon.

She did?

Did she hit you?

She winged me.
Did she really?


It ain't funny, Melvin.

Now, I hear there are laws
against things like that.

Yeah well she'd be locked up right now

if her uncle wasn't the Sheriff.

You're not the Sheriff?

Nah, he's just the new deputy.

Shut up Moe!

Why you looking for her?

Oh we were friends,

I told her I'd look her
up if I was in the area.

Oh yeah, well where'd you meet her?

We went to school together.


Well she ain't never left
this area, her whole life.

And where's she living now?

Oh she's just out on the...
Shut up, Moe.

She got a place outside of town,

a little cabin on Crabbe Creek Road.

She don't like strangers coming around.

Maybe that's why she shot at you.

You know uh, I'll give
Melissa credit for one thing.

She used to be the prettiest girl in town.

Used to be?

What happened?

You showed up.

Aren't you just the charmer.


we got off on the wrong foot.

Why don't you let me buy you another drink

and maybe afterwards we can take a drive

out to Melissa's place.

Oh yeah?

And what are the odds we'll
run out of gas on the way?




What do you think you're doing?

You're kind of jumpy there aren't you?

I'm warning you!
You're warning me?

(CHUCKLING)
I...

JENNIFER: Melissa?

Who's that?
Melissa it's me, Jenn!

Jenn...

Oh for god sakes Melissa, Jenn?

Jenifer, Jennifer Katsmin,

your best friend from high school.

Jenn?
That's what I said.

Uh, what are you doing here?

Sure great to see you
too after all these years.

You moved away.
But I'm back now.

Are you at all glad to see me?

(TENSE MUSIC)

So, I just finished up this
shoot in Manhattan and,

I had a couple of days so
I thought what the hell,

I'll rent a car and see if I can't

find my old friend Melissa.

Manhattan, that's like
hundreds of miles away.

Yeah like 600, but,
that makes it 2000 closer

than Los Angeles, so, what the hell.

You live in Los Angeles now?

Yep, for like five years, modeling,

and making cheap exploitation movies.

I'm, Jennifer Kane.

I don't suppose you've seen any.

I, I don't go to the movies.

They're on TV all the time.

I don't have a TV.

I know.

Nor a phone or apparently even a mailbox.

Now, you seem to think that I betrayed you

by moving out of this sinkhole of a town?

But excuse me for wanting to have a life,

I made every effort to
stay in touch with you.

I wrote, I tried to call,
I sent birthday cards

and Christmas cards, even
gifts, and you never even

acknowledged them!
I never got them!

You never got them, any of them?

Oh, they don't deliver
the mail out here anymore,

not since I...

I, anyway I never got them.

You know, this was all a mistake.

I'm sorry I came here,

I'm sorry I barged in on
your idyllic existence.

I'll just go.

But, just so you know, as
far as I was concerned,

we were always friends,
we're still friends,

I still love you, so just deal with it!

Well, oh, well wait where are you,

where are you staying?

I don't, I don't know, I was,

gonna look for a place in town,

but I think I pissed off the local deputy.

Sonny Huggins?

I don't know I guess.

Macho guy, kind of a goon?

That's Sonny.
He was getting fresh

with me in the bar today
so I had to pop him one.

You did?
Yes.

And then I maced him.


I-I shot him in the ass this morning!

You what (CHUCKLES)?
I shot him in the ass.

No you didn't?
Yes!


You actually shot him in the ass?

Yeah (CHUCKLES).

Um...
That's funny.


I don't know are you sure?

I can't imagine you have
many house guests here.

Please stay.

Okay.

(KEYS CLATTERING)


Hello?

Yeah, this is Sheriff Clarke.

Well that's right, yeah.

What did you find out about it?

A few miles outside of town.

No, it was more like a field.

Who's that?
Although now that you

mention it,

Who you talking to?
the tracks were heading

down towards the pond along

the old Crabbe Creek Road.
Oh!

Hey, is this about that barn burning down?

Uh, that's right, Old Crabbe Creek.

What about it?

Hey, is this about that
We'd be glad to have

one of your guys
barn burning down

last night?
come down her but...

Can't you tell me anything at all?

Is this about that lost dog?
Will you shut up?

No, not you, I'm sorry.


When's he coming down?

This afternoon?

Sure, that'll be fine.

Okay yeah, thanks.


Who was that?
It was the

State Wildlife Commission.

And you know I hate it when you badger me

when I'm talking on the phone!

What'd they have to say?

Not much.

All questions and no answers.

What the hell is this?

That's an egg white sandwich.

I asked for a bacon,
sausage, egg, and extra cheese.

That's better for you.

Last time you had your physical,

your cholesterol was through the roof.

Try it, it's good.

Didn't they tell you anything?

No.

But something lit a fire under their feet.

They're sending one of their
guys down this afternoon.

This afternoon?

We only sent them the cast yesterday.

Well, they're sending
a guy this afternoon.

Man this thing looks like crap!

What do you got?

Sausage and egg.

With cheese?

Yeah.

Well there ain't nothing
wrong with my cholesterol.

Hey!

Have that.


Eat it.

It sucks!

Eat it!

Maybe next time you'll
get me what I ask for.


(INSECTS CHIRPING)
(BIRDS SINGING)

So that's how you made your living, huh?

Looking like that?
That's right.

What's the point of being good looking

if you don't get paid for it?

You should try it.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

No I'm serious, come back to LA with me.

I can introduce you to my agent,

you're a good looking girl,

he can get you some work.

No thanks (CHUCKLES).

I-I, haven't got the boobs.

Oh what are you talking about?

You have adorable boobs.

How would you know?

Because I've seen them.

When?
High school, gym class?

Oh...

Well, I think they're a little bigger now.

I should hope so.

What?
Oh, nothing.

Hey listen, in those movies you do,

do you ever have to take your clothes off?

Sometimes.
In front of all those

guys you work with?
Yeah.

And those movies are
shown all over the world.

And guys watch them.

And you know what those guys do when

they watch you naked, don't you?

Man I could never do anything like that.

No I guess not.

Not me.

So, what do you do?

What do you mean?

Well, how do you support yourself,

what do you do for money?

Um, I'm okay.

What is okay?

Um, my parents left me some money,

and, and my Uncle Ray
invested it, so, I do fine.

So, you just hang around here all day?

Well, I take care of the property.

Um, I protect the things that live here.

I keep people away.

Hey, you know what we should do?

We should go out tonight.

Oh, no.

Oh come on, it'll be fun!

I haven't been back in five years!

I want to see some of the old places!

I don't leave the pond at night.

You go.
No, you have to come.

It won't be the same without you.

We can get a pizza at Antonio's?

Boy, I don't remember the
last time I had pizza (SIGHS).

Remember that time we went

and Nick Gordon came
in with his girlfriend?

Chastity!

Boy talk about false advertising!

Yeah, she started ragging on you,

so you poured that hot
sauce down her pants.

And she said it was burning so you put

a pitcher of ice water down her ass...

Oh, we were a hell of a team.

Come on, it'll be fun, you have to.

I'll think about it.

(RELAXING MUSIC)

(METALLIC THUDDING)

Don't tell me you can't do anything!

My Basel has been gone
since early this morning

and he never disappears without telling me

where he's goin'!
I'm sorry Mrs. Tromby,

there's really nothing I can
do about it at this stage.

I'll keep my eyes open,
and if I see Basel,

I'll send him home to you, that's all.

Can't you put out a bulletin,
call the State Police?

This is a domestic issue,
the state won't get involved.

Why don't you just go on
home and wait for him?

He's bound to show up sooner or later.

You're useless, this is useless.

I don't even know what I pay taxes for.

I don't know Mrs. Tromby.

(DOOR THUDDING)

Husband take off?

Basel's her toy poodle.

Nasty little bastard.

A lot of small animals
go missing around here?

No more than most places I don't reckon.

Mind telling me who you are?

Stewart MacKendrick.

State Wildlife Commission.

Oh yeah, right.

Good to meet you.

And what's the verdict
on that cast we sent?

Well, we're going to need
a little more information

before I can be positive.

RAY: But you have an idea
or, you wouldn't be here.

Can you take me to the place
where you found the tracks?

No.
(CHUCKLES) No?

Mr. MacKendrick, I'm not one
of those small town Sheriffs

you see on TV, I don't
piece together clues,

and I don't solve mysteries every week.

I break up fights and,
hand out traffic tickets.

And I'm fine with that.

'Cause I don't like
mysteries, they confuse me,

and they piss me off.

So if we're gonna get along,

you gotta be a lot less mysterious.

Fair enough.

Help yourself.

I suspect that the tracks you sent me

belong to Decapod crustacean
of the order, Brachyura.

Dumb it down for me.


A crab.


Yes it would.

The largest known crab is
the Beringer King Crab.

The one that made those tracks would be,


I thought crabs were saltwater animals.

No, there are over 1300
species of freshwater crab.

Though you don't normally
see them this far north.

They're pretty interesting creatures.

They can breath on land, live
in caves, hollow tree trunks.

They're nocturnal animals,
foraging at night.

And unlike saltwater crabs,

which lay thousands of
eggs and abandon them,

freshwater crab will lay only a few eggs,

and look after their young
when they've hatched.

Charming.

Do they rip down barns
and slaughter cattle?


Do you want to show me where
you found the tracks now?

Sure.

(BIRD SINGING)
So you think a crab

did that huh?

No.

I said these tracks were made by a crab.

For all I know, someone drove
a bulldozer through that wall.

Funny, that's what I said.

STEWART: Did you notice
these little tracks?

RAY: No.

They're all over the place.

I would say the creatures that
made these tracks were about,

1/10 the size of the larger one.

RAY: Creatures?

Too many to be just one animal.

Babies?
I don't know.

Maybe, or just smaller
variants, I don't know.

mysterious, I just don't know.

Mind if I look around
for a little on my own?

Can't wait for you.

I'll find my way back.

Eh, suit yourself.

I'm not good enough for you

Yeah, that's it!

Oh god...
Really.

Here's 50 bucks, what'll that buy me?

Oh, you want to know, you
want to know what, smarty?

Huh?

That!
Hey, that was 50 bucks!

I have never had sex for money,

I will never have sex for money,

This couldn't wait.

I just sent you some pictures.

Check 'em out, will you?

Now?
Yeah now.

DALE: Hold on (SIGHS).

Hey, what the hell is this stuff?

The first ones are egg sacks,

but they're the size of footballs.

The others are discarded exoskeleton.

DALE: How, how big?

About eight feet across.

Holy crap.
Say it, say I was right.

DALE: You were right.

Those prints came from a
gigantic frickin' crab!

But where did it come from?


I got chased off the property
by some crazy lady with

a shotgun before I could
investigate any further.

But listen, I'm gonna need
you to do some digging,

to find anything in the

responsible for that form of mutation.

I'm gonna go get a drink.

I, I work down the

What?


he took off and told me
to take part of his job,

I'll have one, and another

Ginger ale.

Well as a bartender,

here's a fine mechanic.

I work down the street as a mechanic,

What brings you around here?

I'm with the State Wildlife Commission.

That sounds glamorous.

Actually right now it's a little more

interesting than you might think.

I'm down here investigating
some unusual animal tracks.

What, like Bigfoot or something?

STEWART: That's not too far off.

You want to get a table?

Want to join us?

Yeah, why not?

I'm fine here.

Come on Melissa!
Hey, come on,

it's not every day a science geek like me

gets to hang out with two beautiful women.

I said I'm fine here!

Maybe this was a mistake.

Do you want to just go?

Yes!

Gimme a beer!

Oh this is too good!

And there ain't no Uncle Sheriff

Uh, four, five, maybe six!

Where'd these things come from anyways?

That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Look, I was at some old

and some crazy lady came
after me with a shotgun.


Yeah, that's Sally
Rae, she's a hoot huh?

Do you know where this place is?

(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Yeah.

All right, take me there!

What am I, you're chouffeur?

All right I'll pay you 50 bucks!

Okay.
(TIRES SCREECHING)

Great, let me get this straight!

Your best friend is a giant crab?

Well, he wasn't giant when I got him!

He just sort of, grew!
What...

My, my father was working
on some kind of formula.

I don't know what it was,

all he ever told me was
that it made things big,

like I was some stupid
little kid or something.

And, and, I was feeding Peewee
food from the lab maybe,

and I noticed that he was
getting pretty big for a crab.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
But it was gradual, uh,

like, like the Amanda Bellamy
gained all that weight

but no one realized because
it was a little at a time?

Amanda Bellamy didn't
get as big as a house!

Well, you didn't see
her in her prom dress.

And she didn't kill innocent people!

No, Goliath would never kill anyone!

Goliath?
Well I couldn't

very well keep calling him Peewee!

Anyways, he-he's gentle, uh,
he never even leaves the pond!

So where is he now?


Something is going on, I
just don't know what it is.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
So what are those things?

Those are the egg sacks.

Those little crabs you saw?

That's where they came from.

And that big beauty,
that's the exoskeleton.

Crab shells don't grow,

so every few years they shed the old shell

and grow a new one.

So the big one I saw was the mamma crab.

Yeah.

Which must mean, there's, there's a

poppa crab around here too.

Hmm, not necessarily.

Male sperm can lay dormant
in a female for years,

decades even with a monster this size.

So, so these guys could
have hooked up years ago

and they're just having babies now?

STEWART: (CHUCKLES) That's right.

Man I'm glad it doesn't
work that way with people.

Crab eggs!

Crab eggs?

Sketch, you're full of crap!

There ain't no crab big
enough to lay eggs this size!

No I aint!

I saw it with my own eyes!

It's as big as a bus!

Telling the truth.

That what made these tracks?

That's right.

And these things are gonna hatch?

You mean there's gonna be giant baby crabs

running all over my land?

Her.

Her?
The crab's a female.

It was spawning.

It had babies?
(SCOFFS) The babies

are the real danger.

Newborns, they're insatiable,

they'll go after anything they can find.

Where are the babies now?

Hmph, gone, dead.

And is, is, she going to have any more?

I don't know, probably not.

You know this thing's
been living in the pond

for well over a decade now
and no one even knew about it?

How dangerous could it actually be?

What?
He would never

hurt anyone ever!

You saw it kill a woman yourself!

I saw it kill a woman
that destroyed its eggs,

and then went after it with a shotgun.

You can't blame an animal

for trying to defend itself.

So you're taking the crab's side now?

I-I'm just saying, I just...

I just don't know if I want
to see this thing destroyed.


Well...
At least un,

until I've had a chance to study it.

Well, uh, I can't say
you don't have a point but,

we don't have a choice.
