Hey, sweetie.

I'm at the farmhouse. Can't you tell?
Barely getting a signal.

Are you on your way?

Doug?

Okay.

God. Every time it rains.

Jesus.

Hello?

Is someone there?

Stop being such a wuss, Lori.
There's no one here.

Hello?

Is someone in there?

Oh, God! Doug!

What are you doing?

I could've killed you! -How? With
your little key-in-the-fist trick?

Where is your car?

Behind the barn. I wasn't
gonna park next to you.

So you just drove all the way up here, so
you could wait in the dark and yell, "Boo"?

Real mature.

Boo.

Oh, my God!

This is exactly what we wanted.

Oh.

Big night planned?

Something like that.

Oh, wow.

I'm moving up here.

What?

I've gone stir-crazy since
I sold the company.

I need something to do.

I mean, plus, do you have any idea how
much faster this place is gonna get done,

if we move up here full-time?

Yeah.

You here alone?
By yourself every day?

You're gonna go nuts.

If we set up full-time?

Seriously?

Lori,

you are the most
perfect person for me.

And when I picture my life...

When I picture the future,

there's no version
that doesn't have you.

I promise,

wherever fate may take us,

it'll be together.

Will you marry me?

Yes.

I think the rose petals
were a bit much.

Hey!

You just going
to the hardware store?

Yeah, you need me
to pick something up?

No, I just thought
you might need your, uh...

You think?

Thanks.

Come here.

Why?
Just do it.

What do you want?

A little closer.

Tell me why.

No, stop!

Stop!

Douger. How ya doin'?
Hey, man, how are you?

I got that stuff here for ya.
Thanks.

Hey, you still plugging away
at that old rat trap up there?

Yeah. I'm actually moving up
there full-time pretty soon.

Really? Funny,
you don't look suicidal.

But, hey, everyone needs
a hobby, right?

Say, do you know Woody?

Woody, this is Doug. He just bought
the old Hegeman mansion up there.

Hegeman mansion?

True story.

That Hegeman widow?

She was one of the first
serial killers.

Oh, yeah, the, uh...
The urban legend.

It's not a frickin' legend.

Ilsa Hegeman brought over
young maids from Ireland

and killed them
in her basement.

Get the hell out of there.
Okay, okay.

No. She put a curse
on that place.

It sucks you in.
Gets a hold of you.

Thanks for the drama, Woody.

TJ's got that stuff on the back
dock, why don't you go take a look?

Listen to me.

Oh, come on!

I'm so sorry to bother you with this.
I'm just not mechanically inclined.

And I walked out
without my cell phone.

This is like
the last thing that I needed.

Your dad never taught you
to change a tire?

Uh, no.

Well, come watch me do this.

It's good to know, in case
you get stranded somewhere

without a handsome stranger
to help you out.

Yeah, or you.

Seriously, though, thank you.

Oh, uh, Doug.

Jamie.

I'm sorry.
That's...

So you live up at the
big old farmhouse, right?

You a cop?

No, I, um...
I go jogging there every day.

I've seen you out working
a couple of times.

Yeah, it's really just a weekend
fixer-upper for us right now.

Oh, are you...
And you're done.

Thank you so much.

No worries.

Here.
Thanks.

So what do I owe you?

First visit's free.
No, seriously, I...

Don't worry about it.
Just repay the favor someday.

Well, thanks again.

You didn't learn
anything there, did you?

Uh, I could, like, lie to you.

Take care.

Oh, God!

How long have you been
standing there?

Long enough.

Store took a while, huh?

Yeah. I had to stop and help a
girl with a flat on the way back.

Oh, yeah?
Little damsel in distress?

Aren't they all?

No.

Hey, we're gonna be late!

Lori, you ready?
We gotta get going!

I'm putting my shoes on!

Lori!
Coming!

Hey!
Hey!

Welcome back to civilization!
Hey, good to see ya.

So tell me, how's that little
shack in the woods?

Seriously, I still don't know
why you bought that shithole.

To get away from you. -Oh, my God,
that's totally such a valid point here.

Look at this. The blushing bride.
How ya doin'?

So tell me everything
that happened.

Did he do a good job
with the proposal?

Did he do the rose petals?
'Cause that was...

Dude, that's next week.

Um...

You're an asshole.

Well, okay, you know what?
Look, it's not too late, okay?

We can run away together, get a little
place in the islands, just you and me.

Let me see it!

Present the rock.
Hey, Nay.

Ooh.

Round cut, good clarity.

Classic.

Good job.

Tomorrow we'll get it appraised.
Make sure it ain't fugaze.

Hey, Doug.

For God's sake, Naomi.
I ams what I ams.

I know. And I love your yams.

Uh-huh, uh-huh. Then springs
for the rings, <i> amigo.</i>

What are you doing? What are you,
like doing the Heisman here.

Yeah, I'm trying to show you
there's something missing.

Oh, is that right? Yes, there
is something missing, actually.

It's the food.
You guys ready to eat?

I thought we were just grabbing drinks.
No, no, no.

No, I got us a table.
Come on. Right this way.

Come right along.
Move it along.

Move it along.

Surprise!

Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

to announce our newly engaged
friends, Doug and Lori!

All right, all right.

There you go, of course,
of course, absolutely.

And don't forget about you.

Doug.

Lori.

May the joy that you feel today

only be a fraction
of what's to come.

And as they say
in the old country,

here is to our wives
and our girlfriends.

May they never meet!

Cheers.

Wait, wait.

We need a picture.

All right.

Well, give us something good!
Kiss her!

Let's see the ring!

So he parked behind the barn
and surprised you?

He did, it was really cute.

Fuck.
What?

Alan.

What is he doing here?
Did you invite him?

We were talking about the
surprise party at work.

No, you didn't tell him.

He overheard... Oh, my
God, he's coming over here.

Hey, hey, hey, there she is.

Alan, what are you doing here?

What? I can't come by
to congratulate you?

You know, you could've invited me.
Okay, can you please leave?

Just could you... -Whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax, listen.

I just wanted to see you, okay?

I just wanted to...
Oh, hey, the lucky guy!

What's going on?
Congratulations.

Doug, please don't.
Oh, he's scrappy.

Why are you here, Alan?

Well, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

I mean, the course of true love
never did run smooth and all.

You have a lovely bride.

And Lori, well,

you could have been
with a future Congressman,

but instead...

Hmm. But I understand the two
of you acquired a nice little

fixer-upper in the country.

Bravo.
Hey, hey, hey.

Is everything okay here?
Yeah.

Alan was just leaving.

Yeah, so I was.

Lori, when this whole thing
falls apart,

and it will,

you look me up.

Doug.

Joke.

You want to talk about it?

I thought that was over.

It is.

It's been over. It was never really
even a thing in the first place.

Really?

'Cause those text messages I saw
sure made it seem like a thing.

Seriously, Doug?
I thought we were past this.

It was a year ago.
Nothing happened.

It was just some text messages.

I don't know
what else I can do.

I fucked up. I'm sorry.

And I know it's not an excuse,

but you were completely
wrapped up in work.

How long are you gonna
punish me for this?

I don't know.

How long will your ex-boyfriend be
showing up at our engagement parties?

Please don't be like this.

I don't want to be. You think
I like being this way?

I love you.

We're getting married. Doesn't
that count for anything?

I don't know.

Do you trust me?

Doug?

Do you trust me?
Yes.

Slow down, Doug.

Doug, please slow down.

<i>So how much more packing?</i>

Just this and the bedroom.

Well, the bedroom's packed.

Look, don't go up there.

Just stay at my place
for a while.

You go out to that house and you're
gonna be surrounded by nothing but her.

And I'm not now?

What about the therapy?

You know, for your, um...
Your injury.

I'm fine.

What I don't need is a bunch of
people looking at me with pity.

Hey, man, look, come on.

It wasn't your fault.

It was an accident.

I know that you feel terrible,
but you can't dwell on it.

You have to move forward. You
can't just live in the past.

I'm not living in the past.

It's only been six weeks.

I just want to finish
the house the way Lori wanted.

<i>Hey, man, look,</i>
<i>I mean, we all miss Lori.</i>

Hello?

Someone there?

How's everything tonight?

Uh, okay.

I just needed
to get out of the house.

Little stir-crazy?

What can I get ya?

Scotch and soda.

Heard about your lady.

Condolences.

How's the house?

Seen anything yet?

Like what?

Like the old lady?

She was a nurse
in the Civil War.

After the war,
she come back here,

her whole family's gone.

Husband, the father,
dead in the war.

Mother and sister died
of influenza.

She took over the big house,

shut down the farm.

She placed ads for servants
in the newspapers in Ireland.

People would see the girls
at the train station.

They go up to the house to work

and then, poof!

Nobody ever sees them
ever again.

Last call.
Yeah.

So what happened
to the servants?

They worked for a while.

Then, one night when they're sleeping,
she comes at them with ether.

They wake up in the basement.

She'd keep them locked up in there,
so she could hear them screaming.

Then, when she felt like it,
when she'd heard enough,

she had this gas tap
she installed.

She'd turn it on

and listen
until the screaming died out.

How do you know
so much about this?

My brother used to
own that house.

Really?

I'd love to talk
to him about it.

What?
He died.

1970. In that house.

I'm sorry to hear that.

In the middle of the night,

his teenaged daughter
took an ax,

killed him,

killed my sister-in-law
as they slept.

Killed her little sister.

And used a shotgun on herself.

Oh, my God.

That house
took control of his mind.

My niece was an angel

the day they moved
into that house,

but in a couple of months,
she was different.

Right hand to God,

that house

is what made her...

Hello?

Hello?

Anyone here?

Lori!

Where are you?

I'm sorry!

I knocked.

Yeah.

Please don't ever
do that again.

How's the work comin' up here?

Good. So far so good.

Good.

Well, you know, maybe it'd be a good
idea then to get away for a while.

You know,
maybe get back in the game.

I got a couple deals cookin'.

I wanna get this done.
I can't leave yet.

Yeah.

What is, uh... What's this?

Uh, a gift.

Grad student
lives down the street.

Really?

It's not like that.

I helped her with a flat tire.

Oh.

Yeah, well, you know, I mean,

that's good, that's good.

It's good to make some friends up here.
Someone to talk to.

Who are you?

Jesus!
You scared me to pieces.

Who are you?

Keep quiet, you'll wake her.

Please, help me.

She's going to kill me,
I know it.

For the love of God,
find someone to help me.

Patricia!

Please.

Coming, ma'am!

Hi.

I just wanted to see
if you got the pie I made you.

I'm so sorry.

How did it...

I mean...
Car accident.

Oh, my God. That's horrible.

So why are you up here
all alone?

Shouldn't you be
with your family?

My mom passed away.

My dad...

Who knows where he is.

It's hard when you lose
someone young.

It's like you have to mourn the life
you were going to have together.

Sometimes I feel
like she's still here.

That's totally normal.

Is it?

It doesn't feel normal.

Feels like my mind's
playing tricks on me.

You should spend time
with other people.

That's what Connor says.

Well, yeah.

Too much time alone,
you get stuck up in your head.

Your brain becomes like a maze.

So what about you?
What's your deal?

Well, I get my master's degree
in May.

Family therapy.

Just the person I needed
to be talking to.

Yeah, right.

So what do you do?

Before the accident,

I was in finance.

Yeah, we basically bought
the entire estate as is.

Pretty impulsive, I guess.
No.

All these old buildings,
the history.

If I lived here,
I'd never want to leave.

So when will you be finished
with all the restoration?

I don't know. A while.

I'm talking too much.
I'm sorry.

No. It's fine.

Listen, I feel like I need
to tell you something.

I appreciate you
coming over here

with the pie and everything.

And I don't know
what you're thinking,

but I need to let you know
that I'm not interested

in any sort of dating
or relationship or anything.

Oh, no. Look, I'm not in any way
capable of dating anyone right now.

I just thought we could,

you know, be friends.

You seem like you could
use someone to talk to,

and I probably could, too.

Anyway, I should get going.

I want to get a run in
before it gets dark.

Okay.

Well, thanks again for the pie.

No problem.

Hey, wait.

I think I really could
use a friend.

<i>Do you miss me?</i>

<i>I do.</i>

<i>I miss you, Doug.</i>

<i>I'm falling apart.</i>

<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what's real anymore.</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>

Lori?

Connor? Connor?

It's Doug. I don't know,
he's talking to himself.

Doug?
<i>- Connor?</i>

<i>What is it?</i>

You called here.
Is everything okay?

I'm fine.

Look, I'm coming out there.
Don't. I'm fine.

Just go back to sleep.

Just so you know, I'm not
stalking you or anything.

You okay?

Yeah, I just...

I don't know
what's wrong with me.

Listen, if I have to eat dinner alone
one more night, I'm going to go nuts.

Let me cook dinner for you
tomorrow night. Around 5:00?

Do us both some good.

I couldn't ask you...
That's why I'm asking you.

I'll take that as a "yes."

Big night planned?

Something like that.

Is this why you killed me?

Stay away from him!

She's late.

Lori?

Hello?

Hey, what are you doing?

Please, please! Let me out!

Please!

Come on!

Jesus.

Help me.

<i>I'm sorry about today.</i>

<i>Where were you?</i>

I was home. I heard you.

<i>Oh.</i>

I wouldn't have been
a very good host.

<i>Why?</i>

I was thinking about Lori.

Anyway,
I just wanted to apologize.

I hope you weren't too upset.

I poured my angst out
into my diary.

I'll get over it.

If you still want to come by,
I'm free tomorrow.

<i>I promise to answer</i>
<i>the door this time.</i>

<i>Your turn to sweat.</i>

So you've actually seen her?

The widow?

I don't know, maybe.

It could be a lot of things. You've
been through so much stress.

You're cooped up there
all alone.

This old guy, Woody,

he thinks the place is haunted.

Maybe it's putting thoughts
in my head.

Uh-oh.

You know what?

I've got an idea.

Doug! It's ready!

Smells great.

Here's what we're going to do.

Slumber party.
We stay up all night,

wait for the ghosts
to come out.

It'll be fun.

Every time it rains.

The place looks great.

Sure, by candlelight.

How's the renovations going?

It's slow. A lot of work.

So...

Ghosts.

Where are we looking?

Seriously?

Down here?

Oh, my God.

Could you have
a creepier basement?

I don't know.

Oh, my God!

I'm sorry. -You scared
the shit out of me.

Sorry.

This place is horrible.

But no ghosts.

I hate to break it to you,
but so far, you're crazy.

Thanks.

So what about you?

What do you mean?

Well, you don't talk about
yourself much.

You picked up on that, huh?

I don't like to talk much
about my personal stuff.

Yeah, I kinda got that.

It's cool. I mean...

You're here trying to help me figure
out if my house is haunted, so...

We all have issues.

No. I need to be
more open with you.

Or, like, in general.

Let's just say I'm attracted
to the wrong type of guy.

I grew up in Arizona.

My dad was a contractor.

Sometimes.
Mostly he sold drugs.

Coke, meth, oxy.

My mom tried
to take care of us,

but I think she was
from an abusive family.

In any case, she was in
an abusive marriage.

He beat her,

beat me up.

Begged us to forgive him.

I'm sure you know Chapter 2. A
series of fucked-up boyfriends.

A constant search
for a new daddy,

always ended in a substitute that
was just as bad as the original.

Then I met the total package,
addiction, uneducated,

emotionally abusive,
physically violent.

One day I didn't want
to do it anymore.

I stood up to him.

He came after me
with a kitchen knife.

That's when I decided to leave.

I have something
I need to tell you.

The car accident.

Lori...

We were having an argument.

I was driving fast.

Angry.

I should have known better.

I just wanted you
to know that...

That it was my fault.

It's really normal
to feel that way.

But you can't control
everything, Doug.

Ninety-nine times out of 100, you
could do the exact same thing,

and it would be fine.

Life is full of accidents.

They aren't punishments.

You can forgive yourself.

Are you here?

Doug!

Oh, my...
I didn't see you.

Lemon or cream?

I don't care.

Something wrong?

I get it.

It was too soon.

Maybe I should go.

Of course I should go.
Obviously.

I'm so sorry I did that.

I would never hurt you.

And I would never leave you.

And our baby.

Can I see?
No. It's not finished yet.

I'm changing the plans.
Hmm.

Get out of here.

Hey.

You wanna see it?

What do you think?

This will be the baby's room.

What?

It's all going to work out,
isn't it?

Of course it is.

Hello.

So how's life in the sticks?

Did you go Amish yet?
<i>- It's good.</i>

Yeah, no, I'm sure. I can actually
smell the manure through the phone.

<i>I'm in the middle of something.</i>

What? Are you blowing
me off already?

<i>Look, listen, man,</i>
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

Why don't you just come into Philly?
Stay with us,

forget about the house
for a while...

I don't want to forget
about the house.

No, I didn't mean it that way,
I just meant that you...

You don't get it.

So let me spell it out for you.

<i>This house means</i>
<i>everything to me.</i>

I am never leaving this house.

<i>Okay. I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Well, then when can I come out</i>
<i>and see what you're doing?</i>

Something on your mind?

You.

I don't care
if this isn't real.

Remember the last time you
made love to me in this bed?

Remember my touch?

My lips?

My mouth?

Look at me.

No!

Why did you do that?

You needed to see the truth.

The truth?

If you wanted to be with me,
then why did you kill me?

It was an accident.

You want me to leave,
don't you?

What's holding you here?

Jamie?

Stop it.

You're not real.

Suddenly it matters again?

I've had enough of this!

<i>- Hey, it's Jamie.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

Hey, it's me.

I know this phone call should
have come sooner.

<i>But here goes...</i>

<i>I got scared that morning.</i>

<i>You were right.</i>

<i>But you're the only one</i>
<i>I can talk to.</i>

<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

<i>This house is tormenting me.</i>

<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

<i>Lori.</i>

<i>I need help.</i>

Doug, what are you doing?

You won't return my calls.

Figure it out.

I'm sorry about what happened,
okay?

Doug, I heard all this before.

Jamie.

I can't.

Okay.

Look, I know I'm screwed up.

I've been having some problems,

and I'm begging you
for your help.

I'm sorry.

Get in.

No!
What?

Shh.

It's okay.

Do you still think
I should trust you?

I have to move on.

I'm sorry.

Don't you see what's coming?

Every experience will
be poisoned with guilt.

Every accomplishment.

Everything we should have had.

I'm not listening
to this anymore.

Your daughter.

Doug?

What's wrong?

Nothing,
I just think you should go.

No.
What?

No.

I'm not leaving you.

You're grieving.

You can't keep
pushing people away.

Make her leave, Doug.

Don't tell me what to do.

I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm trying to help you.

I don't need your help.
I need to be left alone.

No, you don't.

I'm not leaving you. You need
someone to stay with you.

You've lost so much.

Lori.

Lori didn't leave me.

I don't mean it that way, Doug.

You've suffered a tremendous
amount of...

I think the baby is sick.

What?
You're suffering.

Would you stop trying to
psychoanalyze me.

I'm not trying to pressure you.

I'm here for you.
Whatever you need,

I just don't think
you should be alone.

I'm not alone.

I'm confused.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I promise.

How could you do this to me?

Don't you touch her.

Who are you talking to?

The baby.

Don't run from me!

Stop!

I have to protect our family.

I hate her!

Let me in!

Stay there!

Doug!

Doug!

No!

Get off of me!

Jamie?

Doug!
Jamie!

Jamie?

Lori?

No.

Come back.

Come back, come back.

Shh.

Why did you do this?

Jamie?

Is anyone here?

Thank God.

<i>Hey, it's Jamie,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

Um, hey, Jamie.

It's Doug.

Please call me.

Call me. Text my cell.
Anything.

Just let me know you're okay.

Hey.

I was just about to knock.

The place, uh...
Looks good.

Look, I, uh...
I brought you something...

Why are you here?

I was just checking in on you.

I just wanted to give you this.

It was all I could think of.
Checking in?

Like I'm too incompetent
to take care of myself?

Doug, no one's heard from you.

You're all alone up here...

I want to be alone.

Look, if you ever
get yourself together again,

give me a call sometime.

I'd love to catch up
with my friend.

She's not coming back, Doug.

You don't know that.

We both know that.

I don't know anything!

Stay away!

You're not even real.

I'm not?

What's that supposed to mean?

Like it's a question? Like, you
don't know if you're real?

I can't take it anymore!

I can't live like this!

I was just trying to make myself
feel better, and I don't.

Stay with me.

Stay with us.

Stay with us.

<i>Hey, it's Jamie,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

I know it's hopeless
to try to reach you,

I just...

I want to let you know
you've meant a lot to me.

I don't want you to feel guilty
for what I'm about to do.

I've tried everything
I can think of,

I just don't see any answers.

This needs to end.

Maybe this way
everyone can be happy.

Anyway...

Thank you.

What's going to happen?

It'll be cold at first.

Dark.

Then what?

And then I'll find you.

I didn't want to
leave you here all alone.

I wanted to help.

I was afraid that I couldn't
do anything for you.

Yeah, hey, man,
I just wanted to apologize

about our conversation
the other day.

Yeah, it's no problem.

Is everything okay? <i>-That's
just what I wanted to tell you.</i>

<i>I'm doing a lot better. I think
I'm gonna get through this.</i>

Woody!

<i>Anyways, I just wanted to say</i>
<i>I appreciate it, man.</i>

<i>- Thanks, man.</i>
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

I just wanted to let you know

I'm getting out of
that house up there.

Okay.

Selling it.

Good for you.

Screw over some
other poor bastard.

I should probably go to class.

You gonna learn how to
help crazy people?

Yeah.

You know, you'll probably learn
a lot more by staying here.

Oh. Look who got funny.

Is that a joke?

No. -Are you making
jokes now, Doug?

No. I'm not funny.

I'm depressed.

You look depressed.

Hmm.

Maybe class can wait.

Doug, what is it?

I thought you were hurt.

It was a dream.

Shh.

I'm here.

Hey!

You forgot your keys.

You know most people around
here don't carry pepper spray.

Oh, yeah?

Well...

Maybe I'll get rid of it.

Call me after class?
Hmm.

See you.
See ya.

You're such a liar.

You promised me.

I love you.

You'll always be with me.

That's what I promised you.

But my life has to change.

This is the end?

I need to focus on reality.

On things I can change.

Don't come back.

I know what's real now.

Do you?

Enjoy reality, Doug.

Jamie?

Jamie, are you here?

Jamie?

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Nothing, I think you should go.

No!
What?

I'm not leaving you.
Don't you see?

This is what you did last time.
You're grieving.

You can't keep
pushing people away.

Don't tell me what to do.

I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm trying to help you.

I don't need your help.

I need to be left alone.

No, you don't.

I'm not leaving you. You need
someone to stay with you.

You've lost so much.

Lori.

Don't say her name!

What are you doing?

Doug!

Don't you touch her!

Who are you talking to?

Lori, don't!

Lori's dead!

Don't you see what's coming?

Get away from me!

<i>That house</i>
<i>took control of his mind.</i>

Join me, Doug.

<i>Too much time alone, you
get stuck up in your head.</i>

<i>Your brain becomes like a maze.</i>

<i>You're not even real.</i>

I'm not?
Hello!

<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

Enjoy reality, Doug.

<i>This will be the baby's room.</i>

It's all going to work out,
isn't it?
