Hi, I'm Todd Harper.

And I hope you'll join
me as we make Hawaii

our Next Destination, only
on The Expedition Channel.

Marty, I need to, oh, Paige,
what are you doing here?

I'm seeing if there's
anything we can salvage

from this Hawaii promo.

Marty's the one that's supposed
to be sitting here alone

in the dark, trying to see
if we can save anything.

You're a producer,
you're allowed sunlight

Millie, you're shooting
in Hawaii in three weeks,

and we don't have a host.

No one gets sunlight until
we solve that little problem.

Well, the network is
not gonna give Todd,

the salary he wants,

or the bigger dressing, room
or the bigger, wardrobe budget.

Well, then we need
to replace him.

Well, I have submitted everyone,

with even the slightest
on-camera experience

on a travel show.

And they have rejected
almost everyone.

I think the only one
I haven't sent them, is you.

I don't host shows
anymore, remember?

You miss being
in front of the camera.

Don't tell me you don't.

I am perfectly content
behind the scenes.

Just not these scenes.

Come on, Millie, stop.

Next Destination
was your idea.

I wanna be executive producer
of a show that I created.

Well, they haven't said no.

No, not yet, but hang on!

You said almost,
almost everyone,
rejected almost everyone.

Is there somebody
they're considering?

Ben Burton?
You're kidding, right?

Well, he co-hosted the
first season with Todd,

and the network thinks
the viewers will love it
if he comes back.

I mean, you remember
him, don't you?

No, he left before I started,

but you told me how difficult
he was, you fired him.

Paige, we need a host.

If he's gonna help
us with our ratings,

he might be worth the trouble.

He is all about the stunt
and nothing of substance.

Is he even gonna be happy,
if he can't jump off things?

He doesn't only jump off things.

Who's ready to jump off a cliff?

Hey everybody, it's Ben Burton.

Welcome to another
episode of Bold World.

Today, we are live streaming
from beautiful Belize,

because one of our viewers,
Jessies_Girl1944,

said that this was
one of the best spots,

on the entire planet
to go cliff diving.

And as you can see, it is
a long ways down to that water.

I can't get the shot from here.

Of course you can't
get the shot from here,

you gotta come around to here.

Oh no, I'm not going anywhere
near the edge of that cliff.

Luis, we're live
in 10 minutes, man,

you gotta find your spot.

No, I found a spot, just not
anywhere near that cliff.

Luis, the name of
the show is Bold World.

You gotta be bold, it's
right there in the title.

Yeah well, my idea
of being bold,

does not involve me
jumping off a cliff,

because somebody named
"Jessies_Girl1944" told me to.

Its probably not
even her real name.

Ben, you gotta take this
Next Destination gig.

They haven't offered
it to me yet.

And the truth is, I don't
know what I'm gonna say

even if they do.

You kidding me? You say yes.

I'm doing my own thing.

I like being able to go
anywhere, at a moment's notice,

and not have to follow
a script, I did that before.

Remember how that went?

The one thing I learned is that
I belong off the beaten path.

Well, that cliff
is too far off the path.

Look, Ben Burton
is our only option right now.

It's either him,
or I submit you.

Let's get back out there,
see the world--

No, this, this is how I like
to see the world these days.

Why are you pushing this?

Because I care
about your happiness,

and-- ughh! --
Roger in Accounting says,

I need to be more sensitive
to people's "feelings."

I mean, why would he say that?

Because you put the word
"feelings" in air quotes.

Okay, well, I'm not that
crazy about Ben Barton either.

But, if you don't
want to audition,

we don't have any other choice.

Okay, Millie, do you know
why Todd Harper was so popular?

Because he's British and
people take him more seriously?

No--
Okay, yes, partly that.

But it's mostly

because people felt
like they could trust him.

They knew the things
Todd recommended,

would give them
a great vacation,

that would put them
in a great mood.

Not put them in the hospital.

Okay, I understand
how you "feel"--
Mm...

But you still have to see Ben.

I have to see him?

You already set up an audition?

Well, I've already
talked to him.

And everybody at
the Expedition Channel
is on board,

they just wanna
see him on film,

and make sure
he can behave himself.

You can handle this, sis.

-Hey--
-Hub-bub.

Now remember, you can
only cliff dive,

from certified jump locations.

Please, get some training
before you do it.

Okay.

Wha-ha-ha-hoo!

Here we go! Okay!

How's Hawaii?

Amazing. I'm
on the beach right now.

You should be here.

Well, I should be anywhere,

other than doing
an audition for Ben Burton.

It'll be
great, I promise.

Did you get the reel I sent
for his director, Luis Fuentes?

Yes I did, it's fantastic.

We should get him
to do the Hawaii episodes,

even if-- you know--
Ben doesn't work out.

First,
they're a package deal.

And second, we're filming
in two weeks.

So this needs to work, be nice.

I am always nice.

I can't see you.

Did you just do air quotes
when you said that?

Goodbye, Millie.

What, are you nervous?

Nervous, me?
I dove with sharks.

Oh, I know. I was there.

I was the guy in the water
next to you, screaming.

All I'm saying
is that, compared to that,

this is gonna be a cakewalk.

All I gotta do,
is go in there,

and be my normal, charming self.
That's it, right?

Well, being your
normal, charming self,

is what got you fired
from this job the first time.

So maybe just
dial it back just a bit.

You don't wanna get
into creative differences,

before you even have the job.

Okay.

Ben, Luis, hi,
I'm Paige Marshall.

Paige, Ben Burton.

Luis Fuentes, nice to meet you.

Luis, I saw your demo reel.
Fantastic work, loved it.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

Did you get
a chance to see mine?

Yes, thank you
for sending it in.

So, I'm gonna talk
to Ben first,

and then you and I can chat
afterwards, how about that?

-All right, I'll be right here.
-All right, shall we?

We shall. Hey, you look really
familiar to me. Have we met?

Nope. I don't think so.

No, no, no, no, definitely,

I've seen you somewhere before.

I just have
one of those faces.

Anyway, so you may have
noticed a lot has changed

about the show
since you last hosted.

For instance, instead of
doing a different location

every episode, we now
focus all eight episodes

of the season
on one destination.

-Yeah, I've seen the show.
-Oh.

Yeah. It's very, uh, in-depth.

Yeah, well
we think that's better

than lacking in substance.

Right, Ben why don't
you take a seat?

Okay. Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna stand.

I don't know,
I'm more of a stand guy.

Sure. Yep, absolutely.

I will just get
that out of your way.

I coulda have done
that, but yeah.

No, that's fine, I got it.

So, thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

Although, I guess
you're used to picking up,

and going wherever
the audience tells you.

That is a common misconception,

but yes-- we do allow
the audience to think that.

What does that mean?

Well, they make suggestions

but I choose where
we're gonna go next.

I thought the whole point
of Bold World was that,

there's no script.

Forget itineraries, and just go.

Yeah, and once I choose
where we're gonna go,

the rest is
very much off-the-cuff.

I find that it works
a little better that way.

Oh, okay, but on
a big show like this,

we need to take things
a little more seriously,

and have a plan.

Well, what I've learned
on my little show,

is that if we're too structured,
it kind of loses that sense

of adventure and spontaneity,
ya know?

You can plan for spontaneity.

Mm... can you?
I don't think so.

It's like saying "working
vacation". It's an oxymoron.

-You can't have both.
-Sure you can.

Just requires a little bit
of discipline.

And where is the fun
in that? Hmm?

I remember one time
we were shooting Bold World

in Costa Rica.
I saw your Costa Rica episodes.

And while you were busy,
uh, running, screaming,

being chased by a crocodile.

Ah, ah, ah, I wasn't screaming.
That was Luis. I don't scream.

Right. Uh, well,
you missed some things

that every traveler should see.

Because you were too busy
being Mr. Danger.

Uh-huh.

What about Pani Popo?

What about Pani Popo?

Mike, it's Millie.

I have something I think
the network is going

to want to see.

I don't understand.

This season in Hawaii,
you and Ben,

will be co-hosts
for Next Destination.

Explain that again?

The network saw the footage
of the two of you together,

and they really enjoyed
the back and forth.

You mean, where we argued
for 10 minutes straight?

Banter, they love it.

Listen, this is
just a one-season deal.

So, if it goes well,

they'll consider letting
you do it by yourself.

Why can't he just
do it by himself?

The network thinks
he's stronger with you.

Plus, they think you can
help keep him in line.

So now I'm his babysitter?
No, you know what, Millie?

I cannot host
a show again.

You know what
happened last time.

Ah, that was years ago.

-Everyone's forgotten
about that.
-I haven't.

Paige, you're not gonna
be doing this by yourself.

Ben's gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there.

This is gonna go so far

in showing that
you're a team player,

you are saving
Next Destination.

And the network
is going to remember that,

when they are deciding

on whether or not
to pick up your new show.

Plus, you can still do
Bold World in between seasons.

This is gonna be
such great publicity.

-I'm sorry, Millie,
absolutely no.
-Hard pass.

This was a terrible idea.

What if what happened
to me the last time

I was on camera
happens again?

How could it possibly
happen again?

We are in a Hawaii bubble
of luxury resorts,

and fine dining restaurants
and surfers.

We're never gonna be
anywhere near a goat.

Hey, whoa! Whoa, chip--
Don't say that.

Oh, no! Ay.

-What are you watching?
-Oh! Luis you have
got to see this.

This is the greatest thing

in the history of
the world, watch that.

Here I am at
the Dunfield Goat Farm,

a great destination
for the whole family.

Just wait.

And here we have a little
group of goats right now here.

So you-- Oh!

No! Stay back!
Don't, don't, don't! Help!

I knew it, I knew
I recognized her!

The minute I saw her,
I knew it.

This video has 10 million views.

I'm gonna make it 11.
Oh...

Ben, this isn't funny.

What, not funny?

She's been chased
by screaming goats.

Luis, I'm gonna level
with you, pal,
you were right.

I was nervous
about this gig,

because it's been a long time
since I've done this kinda job.

And I was a little worried,
about looking like a joke.

But now with this, now
I know I'm not the only one,

who got caught on camera
making a fool of themselves.

I'll show everybody some
of my most embarrassing clips.

I'm a big laugh,
it will be great.

Ben, listen to me,
this isn't Bold World.

Oh, man.
You're not by yourself anymore.

You have to learn
how to be a team player.

Bringing up the goat lady,

is absolutely not
the way to do that.

So, promise me?

Fine, I promise.

Hey!

Hello, what's so funny?

Nothing. Nothing's funny,
just videos, watching videos.

Silly videos
of uh... cats.

-Cats on skateboards.
-High comedy.

Yes. Yep, I see
you're going to get ice.

Uh, yeah.
Ordered some room service.

Now I'm going
to watch a documentary
about Muhammad Ali.

Oh, great, the champ.
The original G.O.A.T.

A goat, like G.O.A.T.?
"Greatest of All Time."

Kids are saying it
all the time.

Sort of a saying.
I got a headache.
I gotta go.

Okay, we are on
a tight schedule, people.

We do an episode
every two to three days,

and we do them in order.

So that means overview
first, resort second,

restaurants third,
et cetera,

and Ben-- question.

Yes, I was just
wondering what we do.

if we come across like
a really great opportunity.

I mean, I remember
this one time.

Remember when we came
across that place?

I think it was Spain,
and that lady--

So we save two days at
the end, for any re-shoots,

or to add anything
we need-- Trust me.

We know what we're doing.

-I'm just--
-That makes total sense.

And we're both very happy
to be on the team, right, Ben?

Yep. Yep, super-happy to be
on the team, very excited.

Okay, great, well have
a terrific season, everyone.

Yay, all right.

Okay, just like
we rehearsed it,

Ben, opening lines,
welcome to Hawaii.

Then you're gonna
sweep your arms out

and reveal the beautiful view.

-Yep.
-Absolutely, we can do this.

Oh, ah...

Ben, do you need more time
with your lines?

I know you missed
a few during rehearsal.

No, no, no, no. It's not
that I just, I don't know,

should we change it up
a little, don't you think?

Change it up how, why?

Well, if I'm being honest,
I felt a little flat. Right?

I mean, maybe
we should improvise.

We don't improvise,
that's why we've got a script.

Right, Millie?

But sometimes you get
really great stuff,

when you don't stick
to the script, right Luis?

Uhhhh...

Okay, a lot of research
has gone into this,

so we need to do it
the way it's written.

Come on,
let's just give it
a try, see what happens.

Unless, of course, you have
something against fun.

Nope, sure, let's give it a go.

Okay, baba baba baba,
wawawa.

All right, you look great.

-Great big smiles.
-And... action!

-Hey everybody, welcome to...
-I'm Paige Marshall--

Okay! Still rolling.

Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go,
here it comes.

-Hey everyone, I'm Ben Burton.
-This beautiful scene--

Hey, we're relaxing,
we're having fun.

Yeah, but I'm not having fun.
Is anyone having fun?

Can we just go back to
the script? Please, Millie?

Okay, yes, let's do that.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
God, that script.

Still rolling, go ahead.

Stunning beaches, luxurious
resorts, bustling nightlife.

-You missed "incredible food"?
-What now?

Would you say "incredible food"?
I say "bustling nightlife",

sunny beaches, luxurious
resorts, incredible food.

-Do you wanna take a look?
-No, I'm good.

Okay, when you're ready.

Still exciting, here it comes.

Do you wanna count us in?

[I'll just take it
on my own, here we go.

Stunning beaches, luxurious
resorts, delicious food.

Bustling nightlife,
colorful local culture,

and some of the most beautiful
scenery in the world.

I'm Ben Burton--
...and I'm Paige Marshall.

And this is our...

This is our Next Destination.

I was thinking about that "our".
Should the "our" be a "your"?

What?

Right now we're saying
"our" next destination,

but if we say "your",
then it makes the audience

feel like
we're taking them along
for the ride, right?

Todd always said our.
"Our next destination."

That's how it's always been
on the show.

We're not Todd.

Okay, well this is what you get,
for trying to have a little fun.

Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot
we didn't have time to have fun.

This is gonna be
a long three weeks.

Yeah.

Don't worry,
we can fix this.

Great, who are the new hosts?

Listen one of the reasons why
you are such a great producer,

is that you know
how to put out fires.

So now Ben and me
hosting together,

has become
such a disaster.

It's a blaze
I have to extinguish?

I didn't say it's a blaze.

Small fire,
a little bit of smoke.

I should just quit before
it burns the whole house down.

The network thinks
the show is gonna be stronger

with the both of you, and
you're not gonna quit this one.

I don't know, maybe
I'll just live here
in a hut,

selling seashells
by the seashore.

How cute-- no!
What you need to do,

is talk to Ben and find out
his point of view on this.

Okay, lets have it,
you were behind the camera,

what do you think?

That I'm smart enough not
to tell the hosts of the show,

what I really thought
of their performance?

That bad, huh?

At least you should understand
where she's coming from.

Fair enough, I guess
I should talk to her.

Tell her that I'll try
to be more considerate

of how she works.

Yeah, easy. I can do that.
That's a good idea.

Thanks, Luis.
See you later, bud.

That's okay,
I'll get the check.

Thank you for the walk with me.

Yes, we've got
a couple of hours off,

and I wanted to
talk to you as well.

Good, okay, well, I'll go
first if you don't mind.

Obviously we got off
on the wrong foot.

And I think, because we have
to work with each other,

we should really try and
get in step with each other.

Put out the fire,
so to speak.

I completely agree.

Exactly, we agree. Progress.

Now the million-dollar
question is,

-what do we do about it?
-Yeah.

Well, like you said,
we have a little bit of time.

We can go explore.
We could rent a car.

Oh, I don't know
if we should--

Come on, where's
your sense of adventure?

Look, we just--
We go for a drive.

We see some sites, you know?
Blow off some steam,
back in an hour.

Where would we go?

I don't know,
we'll figure it out.

Look, I realize this
isn't your thing.

But it could be fun.

Maybe if we spend a little bit
of time together off-camera,

it'll help us on camera.

-One hour.
-Yeah.

And then we come back to work.

Absolutely. Synchronizing
watches. One hour, let's go.

So you go first,
where are you from,

parents, siblings first pet.

My dad worked for the city.

My mom was a teacher,
one sibling, a sister, younger,

married with two--
soon to be three-- kids,
and, ah, Melvin.

-Alright, your turn.
-Okay, let's see.

From Calgary, Alberta, my father
was an insurance salesman.

My mom was
a stay-home seamstress,

and I kept her pretty busy,

with all
the tears in my clothes.

Um, and Harry the turtle.

Your favorite pet was a turtle?
Yeah.

Yeah, he was great,
played fetch and everything.

That's a terrible joke.

Paige, where are you, call me.

What are you gonna do
until they get back?

-No service.
-Okay, which way?

Well, if we stick
to the main road,

that's gonna take us
back to the resort, so.

Yeah, I think so.

If we go that way,

I believe that'll take us
to the other side of the island.

So I wonder where that one goes.

Should we find out?

Uh, we should really
be getting back.

You said one hour,
I demand my full hour.

All right, but only
for a few more minutes.

Millie is gonna freak out
if we are not back soon.

We'll be back.

-Ben, where are you?
-Paige, please call me back.

I'm sure everything's fine,
they just lost track of time.

-You think?
-I don't know.

Wha'?

Thank you so much, thank you.

-So, you're from New York?
-Arkansas.

I don't know where that is.

Hey, did you know, there
are 137 Hawaiian islands,

not just the seven
inhabited ones?

Well, do any of them have cell
service on deserted roads?

Because maybe that would
have been a better place

to get a flat tire on a vehicle
that doesn't have a spare.

Yeah, there it is.

The "I told you so."
I knew it was coming.

I didn't say anything.

But if I was gonna say
something, I would say,

"I told you we should've
stayed on the main road."

I thought it would be fun!

Well, I'm having fun,
this is so much fun.

It's kinda like
an amusement park,

except, without the rides,
or the food, or... anything!

Just try to think of it
as an adventure, okay?

Granted, sometimes
it doesn't work out,

but when it does...
I remember one time--

No, no, no, no, no,
no more with the,

"I remember one time--"
I can't.

The car rental guy
mentioned zip lining.

"I remember one time."
Crocodile wrestling?

"I remember one time,
I remember one time."

"I remember one time!"

I never wrestled the crocodile.

Right, I forgot.
You ran away screaming.

That was Luis.

And oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot the crocodiles,

weren't as scary as goats.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
said that, that was mean.

Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

Anywhere you're not.

Look, I've done tons of
embarrassing stuff on camera.

I remember one time, I...

Sorry, force of habit.
Mm-hmm.

Look, all I'm saying is that,

you just need to learn to,
I don't know, laugh it off.

Well, I think everyone
else has done

quite a bit of laughing
on my behalf.

You don't understand,
people have come up to me,

random people, for years,
and would just go, "Ba-a-ah"!

Or they just scream
out of nowhere.

It's not funny, I actually
don't think it's funny.

You're right.

You're absolutely right,
it's not funny.

It's just that, I mean,

everybody makes a fool
of themselves at some point.

Yap, but not everybody
has a video of it,

that's been seen
by 9 million people.

Be more like 10 now, but I
saw all their videos of you.

You know, when you were at
work, and you looked good.

You were.
You were charming.

Before all
the screaming goats.

Is that what, uh, made
you become a producer?

I saw Millie a couple
of times on assignment,

and then I ran into her
after you'd left the show.

She needed a producer,

and I thought, well,
I needed a fresh start, so...

You don't miss it? Being
in front of a camera,
going out on the road?

No, not at all.

So why did you agree
to be the co-host,

of Next Destination?

I pitched my own show.
It didn't work.

Millie says, by doing this,

I might make them
think more favorably.

And that's it?

Yeah, that's it.
Hmm.

I just thought that,
uh, maybe there
is a reason.

that the gig, like, may be
a shot at redemption.

Millie is gonna kill us.

Then I came too and I thought,

there's no way I'm ever
swimming with sharks again.

Oh, Luis, no bueno.

Yeah.

Have you heard from him yet?

Well, I thought you were
checking your phone.

-Nothing.
-Nope.

We should really get to work
on rescheduling this day.

Oh, a hundred percent.

Oh, Mahalo!

Do you think I have feelings?

Well, sadly he doesn't get
reception out here either,

but he said he would drive
us back to the resort

when he's done,
in about 30 minutes.

So, we have a choice to
make, we either keep walking,

or...

we eat some pineapple.

-I love pineapple.
-I love pineapple, too.

All right, maybe it's nice,
let me see if I can...

Oh, also, I found
out that his brother,

runs the scuba shop,
next to our resort.

So we could do
a little snorkeling.

Ben, we have all our
recreation segments planned.

I know, it's just that...
Never mind.

No, what?

Its just that, that's
one of the reasons,

why I left them
in the first place.

You know, with Todd.

He was just so
flattened by the book.

You left because you didn't
get your way all the time.

What are you, 12?

I wasn't joking when
I said I like videos

of cats on skateboards.

Hey you couldn't
have always had jobs,

that allowed you to do whatever
it is you wanted to do.

So what did you do before?

Well, I started at a little
local station in Chicago.

Mm-hmm.

Kinda fell into the whole
Adventure Travel thing,

because I was the guy who
was willing to do anything

no matter how crazy.

Thanks to crocodiles.

Yeah, but I got to
do my own segments.

That was the thing.

But when I went to network,
it just didn't work.

So, Millie and I, we chalked
it up to creative differences,

and that was that--
I went and did my own show.

You never missed
having a regular gig?

Mm... No.

Then, why did you?

I don't know,

I guess maybe I wanted
a shot at redemption, too.

Hmm.

You think we'll be able to?

Redeem ourselves, that is?

Well, if you can get over being
chased by screaming goats,

I figure I can probably
learn to follow a script.

At least a little bit.

Just promise me,

I get
to do more than stand
and point at things.

Never fun for you?

No, it's not that,
I'm really bad at it.

Look, ground, sky-- terrible.

c]

All right, so we are
starting with the overview,

of the water activities.

Scuba, snorkeling, surfing.

Uh, I wanna make
sure I got this right.

So we're gonna talk
about these things

but not actually do
any of them, is that right?

This is where the pointing
skills come in handy.

Right, okay, well,
let's see I could point,

I don't know, there.

Hey, look, it's Kako's
Brothers scuba shack.

The guy that drove
us back to the hotel,

we could go snorkeling
will be so much fun.

Okay, for starters, this
is the overview episode,

not the actual
recreation episode.

So it's easier
and more efficient,

-we just stay on the beach.
-Hey, it easier, sure.

But not nearly as much fun.

And just because
it's the overview,

doesn't mean we can't
do anything, right?

Luis, help me out here, man.

We are pressed
for time, but shots
of you two in the water

would be pretty great.

We're already
running behind, so--

Okay, you're just gonna
go into the water,

and you're gonna splash
around a little bit,

and that's really cute.

We're gonna...
splish-splash a little bit.

Paige, we said we'd try
and work together, right?

Yep, yep.

Okay good, I'm gonna
get my suit.

And action.

Hey, everybody, welcome
back to Next Destination,

and our overview of Hawaii.

Now, no trip here
would be complete,

without exploring the incredible
water opportunities,

that the islands offer.

We are literally
surrounded by it.

Usually how an island works.

Ha-ha, so funny.

Now, in our recreation episode,

we will be taking a deeper dive.

Oh. I see what you did
there, very clever.

Thanks for keeping up.
Mm-hmm.

Okay, on that note,
I thought maybe

we'd give you a little
sneak preview, you ready?

-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

-Hi.
-Hi.

So, um, I wanted to...

apologize for, well,
pushing back on...

all of your ideas.

Our bosses are pretty strict

with how we do things, but
they do allow us some freedom.

Snorkeling was
a really good idea today.

Well, thank you.

But the truth is, I am the one
who should probably apologize,

for pushing so hard for changes.

I realize that
we have deadlines,

and that we have
a schedule to keep to.

And I will endeavor
to be more...

respectful of that, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

No, no, no thank you.

Look at us, being all
professional and mature.

I'm very impressed with us.

Who wouldn't be?

Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

Yes, you will.
Good night.

Good night.

We hope you enjoyed
our overview

of what's to come this season
on Next Destination: Hawaii.

Join us next week, as
we explore the best hotels,

and resorts on the island.

The kinds of places Paige
is gonna post pictures of,

to make her friends jealous.

That's what you do
when you have friends,

instead of just followers.

-Ooh! Slay!
-I'm Paige Marshall.

And I'm Ben Burton,
see you next time.

And cut, right.

That's a wrap
on our overview episode.

Paige Marshall
steps up to the plate

and slams it out of the park.

You have got to stop
going off script.

Sound advice, I'll be
sure to write that down

in my script.

Nice work!
Good job, lucky for you.

Well, that was good.

You guys are getting
the hang of it.

Yep, yeah I'm learning
to hide my panic,

every time he improvises.

Well, we finished
the overview episode,

that's progress, isn't it?

Yep, took us three days,
normally takes us two.

Quality takes time?

Sure.

You like the water so much,

are you thinking of
taking up surfing?

No, I'm
doing some research

for our recreation episode.

Did you want something?

So I met this cab driver
named Leilani, and
her cousin is opening

this really cool zip line
attraction in a few weeks?

We're not gonna be
here in a weeks.

I do realize that, but
they're doing test runs today,

and she said that
we could film a segment.

But only today, because
then they're gonna be too busy

getting ready to open.

Ben, we already have
everything booked for today.

We're filming on location
at three different resorts.

And then we've got
the sunset sail boat cruise.

Paige, come on,
a sunset cruise?

Boat trip to see something
that happens literally

every single day, or zip
lining through the tree tops.

This is fun, this is boring.

Ben, I trusted you
with the snorkeling.

That's true, you did.

I think you gotta
trust me on this one.

Okay, you're right, open mind.

-It's okay.
-Sorry.

There you go, thanks so much.
Okay, see ya.

-Whoo!
-Fan of Bold World?

Yeah, kinda... she wanted
a picture of you too.

-Oh...
-She thought we were a couple.

Oh.

I know, I told her I tend not to
date women that don't like me.

I don't dislike you.
Well...

I don't, I don't, you just--

you and I,
we're just very different.

So we may not always get along.

True, but it makes
for good TV.

Hopefully.

Is there a woman in your life,

that doesn't dislike you?

That doesn't dislike me?
Uhh...

I didn't think
it was a tough question.

Didn't like me, I have
to think, let me think.

Well, the truth is
yes, there was one,

but it didn't
work out, so--

Oh, hang on, let me guess,
she wanted to settle down

but you weren't done
being Mr. Danger--

Or, uh, what? Mr. Adventure.

Umm. Yeah, something
like that.

Hey, you guys ready?
Gonna head out.

Yeah, yeah, we'll be
there in a minute.

I still don't think this is
gonna measure up to zip line.

I'm telling you.

-Really?
-Yeah, really.

Maybe if you stopped going
a hundred miles an hour,

and slowed down,

you might actually get
to see where you're at.

You were right, it's beautiful.
I stand corrected.

because this episode
of Next Destination,

is all about the food
here in Hawaii.

From fine dining to food trucks,

to farmers markets
like this one,

we're gonna sample
the best eats on the islands.

Your taste buds ready
for an adventure pace.

Well, that depends
on how much of an adventure

you're talking about.
Well, I don't know.

There was a booth back
there that had everything

from snails to cow's tongue.

Oh, uh, well, why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you?

And I can focus on the desserts.

That hardly seems fair.

You're the one
who wanted an adventure.
Oh!

And... cut!
Great work, you two.

We're gonna get set up
with the next shot.

-Okay, thanks.
-Sounds good.

There may be hope for us yet?

Yeah, stick with me,
kid-- we'll go far!

One week into the shoot and
the network is very excited.

I hope not that excited,

'cause I only signed on to do
just the one season, right?

Of course, of course,

we can absolutely
replace you next season.

Okay.

You're not really
looking forward

to getting back
to your desk, are you?

Yes, absolutely, this
is way too much stress.

Oh, come on, you missed
hosting, I can tell.

Maybe a little, I think
I'm just getting distracted

-by the romance of it all.
-Romance?

Okay, no, no, no,
the romance of...

the island,

the beach and
the people and the food.

What did you call--
the Hawaii bubble?

Not a single person
has recognized me
since I've been here.

I told you. I have short
memories, enjoy your bubble.

What happens when it bursts?

Well, I'm just glad

that you and Ben have
buried the hatchet for now.

I don't know
if we've buried the hatchet,

but at least we're not trying to
kill each other with it anymore.

There's that.

Oh, speaking of Ben,

Go, go on.

I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

-Two glasses?
-Yeah, I got it.

Hey. you. Paige, I would
like you to meet Kekoa.

Kekoa, this is Paige.

He was just telling me about
this restaurant called--

Maluhia, that's right.

They have the best kalua
pork in the islands.

Bake it underground for hours.

He described it
as life-changing.

Only locals go there, best
kept secret type of place.

Exactly.

Well, I do like
the sound of that.

What are you doing for dinner?

What I was just gonna
order some room service,

and do some work.

Change of plans.
We're going out.

-Ben, I can't.
-I'm not saying we send a crew.

I just want you
to go to dinner with me.

Don't tell me you're
not a little bit intrigued.

I saw how you ate today.

Okay.

Well.

Okay.

-Yeah?
-All right.

She said yes,
I can't believe it.

Mahalo, Kekoa, so
where is it again?

Just go straight up Mauka,

make a left by the two coconut
trees and you should be good.

-Okay. Aloha.
-Aloha.

Kekoa was right. Mm!
This is life-changing!

Life-changing.

What, Oh no.

No, no, no, no, it's not that.

You just... Looks like
you're having fun again.

You gotta be careful,
it's habit-forming.

What, so is this food.

If the network
greenlights my new show,

these are the kind
of places I wanna explore.

Now, that I find interesting.

What else would
you do on your show?

Okay, so it's a travel show,
that unfolds like a mystery.

We're gonna give them clues

that they have to figure out
kind of like an escape room,

where we're gonna
blindfold them.

All this from a woman
that needs a plan.

Well, I'm gonna know
what's gonna happen.

But it's a host.

-Well, you were right.
-Yeah?

Yeah, that was good.

What do you think
about adding it

to the off-the-beaten-path
episode at the end?

Hey, that'd be great.

Help it stand out from all
the other restaurants, yeah.

-Exactly. We got a deal?
-We got a deal.

Hey, we've been
looking for you guys.

Oh, we were just
saying good night.

-Ben.
-Yes, goodnight, Paige.

-Ben.
-Paige.

-Ben.
-Why y'all of being weird?

We're not being weird,
you're being weird.

Why are you looking
for us for anyway?

We're gonna go to a concert,
you wanna come?

Concert, yeah that'd be fun,
you wanna go to a concert?

I have some work
still tonight.

-Come on.
-Duty calls.

Okay, you're right,
don't work too late.

Have fun.

Okay, bye.

All right guys, let's go.

-Good night.
-Good night.

The overview episode resorts
and restaurants are done.

We have a good start
on must-see sites.

And then we move into culture
fun in the sun nightlife,

and off-the-beaten-path.

Where is Ben, I thought
he was joining us.

Well, this is supposed
to be our day off,

so I told him to go
relax by the pool.

Why didn't I get that option?

Because you're not a relaxed
by the pool kind of person.

You're a first one
in the office,

work on schedules on
your day off kind of person.

Well, we're not
in the office, are we?

We are in the Hawaii
bubble, remember?

And you are here with me,
working on schedules,

on your day off.

Yeah, and whose idea was that?

Yours. You called me!

Well, I have changed my mind.

I am going to sit by the pool,
and have a little fun.

Okay, why does
everyone keep acting,

like I don't know
how to have fun?

Oh, is this the part where
you're being more sensitive

to people's feelings?

-Yes.
-Okay.

Is it not working?

I am fun, I am a fun person, hi.

Hey, what's going on?

Ben, hi, yeah, I was
just chilling, you?

Well, I was gonna try
my hand at surfing,

but now I think we should talk

about your use of
the word chillin'.

Well, it's our day off,

so Millie wanted
to go over schedules.

I was like, "No way.
I am going to, uh,

have some fun."

Really, well, Paige
Marshall having fun?

That is something I need to see.

How about if I get us a cabana?

Yeah, sure, sounds chill.

Please stop saying that word.

Okay.

So how's that chilling
thing working out for you?

Yeah, never felt more relaxed.

Oh, yeah, I can tell.

Face it, you would rather be
doing schedules with Millie.

No way! Okay, I find doing
scheduling very relaxing.

What's wrong with me?

Relaxing and having fun
are like the muscles.

If you don't use them,
they're gonna atrophy.

What are you, like a personal
trainer for goofing off?

Yes, yes I am.

I like the sound of that.
Put that on a business card.

Aren't you glad you hired me?

You're not gonna
get that from Todd.

That's for sure.
He's way too boring.

No, he isn't.

Oh! Yes, he is.

I worked with him for
a year, remember, so boring.

Well, I find him
very interesting.

Name one interesting
conversation

you had with Todd Harper, go.

Oh, well... we talked
about clothes.

He knows a lot about clothes.

He could, yeah,
he can talk forever

about waterproof jackets--
and, uh,

it was fascinating.

I just about fell asleep
listening to you

talk about that conversation.

I can't imagine actually
having that conversation.

Okay, well I'm sorry.

Not everyone can have
a carefree life,

that's all about having fun
and never anything of substance.

Well, that's unfair.

I do lots of things
of substance.

Name one.

-Like now, an example?
-Yeah, yes.

Well, there are a lot
of them, things of substance.

Oh.
But we're not talking about
me, we're talking about you,

and your inability
to relax and have fun.

So, I say let's
exercise those muscles.

How?

It's a good question.

-Parasailing?
-Yes!

-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

No, no way.

Not in a million years, no.

So you're saying
there's a chance.

No, I'm not, I'm not doing it.

All right, well then you
come up with something.

'80s music trivia contest?

You're so on.
Absolutely.

All right give me a guess.

Flock of Seagulls.

That's correct.

Yes.

Awesome.

Let's Get Physical by-

-Olivia Newton John.
-Olivia Newton John.

Ten points.

Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go.

Ladies and gentlemen, we're down

to our last question

and it is worth 100 points,

so it's anyone's game.

Okay we get this we
win the whole thing.

Oh no, we get this we celebrate.

How?

Oh, I think you know...
parasailing.

-All right.
-Yeah.

-All right.
-Okay.

For 100 points.

What female group
had a 1987 hit,

with a cover of the
Simon and Garfunkel song,

A Hazy Shade of Winter.

Bangles, The Bangles.

That is correct.

Bangles, I knew it.

Awesome, champions.

Oh, my goodness,

gracious congratulations.

I got it, I got it.

Sorry about that.

Give it up for the winners.

What are your names,
Ben, and this is Paige.

Oh, wait a second,
I thought I recognized you.

Ladies and gentlemen,

we have an honest
to goodness celebrity,

right here in our midst.

It's the goat lady.

Hey there, you left without,

your half the world's
greatest trophy.

I was thinking
we could split it.

Which part would you like?

Oh, that's okay,
you can keep both halves.

All right.

You know, the goats
were my idea.

We weren't planning it.

We were on our way to
a location, and I saw this farm,

and I thought,
"Hey, that would be fun.

No script, no rehearsal,
no planning,

just walk out into
the middle of the field,

and start filming it."

I didn't realize someone
else was filming it

on their cell phone.

Yap, that would definitely
be embarrassing.

Oh, it was more
than just embarrassing.

I left the gate open,
when I ran away,

and the goats got out,
they ate everything.

We got sued,

because of course we didn't
have filming permits.

So I was a joke, fine.

But people lost their jobs
because of me.

I can't help but think

if we had just stuck
to the plan, maybe...

Yeah.

You wanna know why
I left Next Destination,

to start my own show?

Oh, creative differences?

Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

Tell you what, why don't
we just wipe the slate clean?

here i.

For instance, the luau.

Did you know, that in ancient
days, it was called, aha'aina.

Aha meaning gathering, and aina
meaning eating many things.

That was correct.

I can do that.

No you couldn't.

No, I could not.

And cut, thank you everyone.

Okay, everyone remember

that we're gonna come back
here tonight for some B-roll

of the luau and festivities
and everything.

So, I think that
went pretty well.

-You did a little research.
-A little bit.

I'm impressed.

And for the record,
I could totally do that.

No, you couldn't.

No, I could not.

-I'll see you.
-All right, bye-bye.

What are you smiling about?

I'm not smiling.

Is this about Paige?

I saw you smiling again.

Its my job, I'm on TV.

Oh come on, Ben, you like her.

No, I don't.

Okay, yeah, I do,
but not that way.

She just, something
happened yesterday

and she was upset, that's all.

Oh, what'd you do?

I didn't do anything,
she's not mad at me.

She told me some personal
stuff and it got kinda serious.

So I was smiling,
because she was smiling.

And I thought maybe she got over

what happened
yesterday, that's all.

Did you ask her
if she was really over it?

Hey, how was that?

Wonderful, I loved it,
I loved it, they're beautiful.

Oh, is there something
wrong with my dress?

No, you look amazing,
so beautiful.

Oh, well, thank you.

You look very handsome yourself.

Yeah, I know.

Thank you for saying it.
It's very kind of you.

Yep, car's out front, shall we?

Oh, all right.

Aloha!

Aloha!

We hope you're
enjoying the program,

in the spirit
of Aloha,

which means peace,
love and compassion.

We'd like to share the tradition

of our Tahitian dance with you.

Do we have any brave
souls out there,

-willing to give it a try?
-Come on you guys.

No, no, no, the joke
about how dancing, no joke.

Oh. Suddenly Mr. Adventure
is not feeling so adventurous.

You wanna get up there and
dance in front of everybody?

No, not really, but,
not because I can't dance.

We have some special
guests here tonight.

The new host of
Next Destination,

on The Expedition Channel.

Oh boy.

Make me proud.

Come on, lets get
this over with.

Come on up.

Oh.

-Aloha.
-Aloha.

Thank you so much.

I'd like to apologize
in advance for the fiasco

you're about to witness.

Don't worry I'm sure
you'll do great.

-Okay.
-Okay,

you're going to start,
by moving your hips.

Oh no.

Okay, now we're going
to add, a smile.

Smile.

I've never been this
uncomfortable in my life.

That's it, aren't
they doing great?

Yes.

Don't tell me
you're not impressed.

You know, if Next Destination
doesn't work out.

I think we got
a shot as dancers.

Oh no, no, no.

That was the beginning

and the end of
my Tahitian dance career.

Oh, poof. I'm just glad
no one recognized me.

Yeah, actually I wanted
to talk to you about that.

You know, when you were talking

the other night, about the...

My crushing embarrassment?

Yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

Yeah, that.

Well, I wasn't exactly
straight with you.

The real reason I left
Next Destination

was not because of
creative differences.

Remember the girl
that I told you about?

Yeah.

Well, it was actually
pretty serious.

I thought she was the one.

So I had it all planned
out-- the big house,

white picket fence,
three kids, two dogs,

Luis in the guest room
above the garage.

Well, what happened?

Well...

I was all in,

and, uh, she wasn't.

I'm sorry.

You know, I figured

what good's a plan
if you can't make it real?

So, after that, following
a script, it just, uh...

I couldn't do it,
so I quit.

And I've just been operating
without a manual ever since.

Take it as it comes
and just see what happens.

Seems to have worked for you.

Yeah, but I think

that I'm realizing

since I've been here,
with you,

that, uh, maybe I
really do want something...

with a little bit
more substance.

You know?

Uh...

The Hawaii bubble,
it just...

The... the what?

It's...

this place.

What happens when we leave

and I go back to New York

and you go to wherever it is
you're gonna go next?

What happens when
the bubble bursts?

I...

I should go to sleep.
We've got an hour to start.

Yeah.

Goodnight, Ben.

Goodnight.

exploring the trails
in this magnificent valley.

That's right, it's a super
fun place for ATV-ing.

That it is, Paige.

however, today
we were UTV-ing.

-What? No.
-Yeah.

What's the difference?

Well a UTV is
a utility task vehicle

and an ATV is
an all-terrain vehicle,

which has a handlebar and
drives much like a motorcycle.

So you just considered
the whole growing-up thing

to be optional?

And we'll be right back
with more recreation

and sporting activities,
including golf, hiking,

and making fun
of your co-host.

Cut.

Okay, thank you, everybody.
We're moving on.

That's lunch, meet back
at the resort at noon.

All right, sounds good.
Thanks, Luis.

So, it sounds like we've
got a couple of hours,

so I think I'll head
back and check on Millie,

see how the cut of
the last episode's coming.

Okay, all right,
sounds good.

I'll see you there,

I think I'm gonna do
a little bit more a UTV-ing.

You wanna join me?

I should probably...

What, check on Millie?

Yes, exactly.

Who's gonna
have what reaction?

When you stand
over her shoulder

as she tries that
at the last episode?

UTV, you say?

Please.

Yee-haw!

That was super fun.

What is your place like
in L.A.?

-Its pretty basic.
-Oh.

Yeah. I'm not there
very much, so it's
no big deal, but, uh...

what's your place
in New York like?

It's cute, it's cozy,
it's small, but... I like it.

What if you're
not there as much,

if they ask us to
do another season?

Oh, they only want me
for one.

Yeah, I know,
but what do you want?

What do you mean?

Well, look, I realized

that we had our
ups and downs, we did.

But... I don't know,

I think it's really
starting to click now.

I like who I am when
I'm with you, on camera.

I think that we should
take the bubble with us.

I think we should do
another season together.

Are you serious?

Come on,
we're a great team.

You know it, and I know it.

So... is this
something that you,

you know, would consider?

I don't know.

Paige, you've
gotta ask yourself.

Would you rather
sit in a dark room,

watching videos of
sunsets and snorkeling,

or would you rather
do those things...

with me?

Are we still talking
about the show?

I don't know.

I don't know
what we're gonna find
if we go down that path.

Ben, it's not even up to us.

We'd have to get Millie
to buy in and the network.

I know.
I agree, but I think
that we should

at least let them know
what we want, right?

Okay, let me talk to
Millie about it first.

Okay, got it.

Then maybe tomorrow
night we'll get together,

and we could strategize.

-Strategize?
-Yeah.

This is sounding
suspiciously like a plan.

-Hmm?
-Nnnnn.

Okay, a little bit.

Okay, what is
wrong with you?

What? Nothing.
What? Why?

You look odd.

Okay, um...

I did wanna
ask you a question.

Okay, go ahead.

Yeah, oh... uh...

so, Ben asked me,

if I would consider thinking
about maybe possibly...

uh...

continuing on to host
the show next season.

Wow, that-- that is big.

Couple weeks ago, that was
the last item on your list

of things that you
would consider thinking
about maybe possibly doing.

I've had a change of heart.

Is this about your heart?

No, not... not really.

I mean, maybe a little.

This is mostly about
me remembering

how much I enjoy
doing this job.

Hosting, seeing the world,

having fun,

I missed it.

Well...

I've been working with
the network to make a list

of possible cohosts
for Ben next season.

So add me to the list.

Look, the network is
happy with the footage

I've been sending them,
but I made it very clear

that you're only gonna
be on for one season,

and if I go back now...

Are you sure
this is what you want?

It's totally not like you.

I-I know.

For the first time in,
well, a long time...

I have no idea what's
gonna happen next.

There was a booth
back there that had everything

from snails to cow tongue.

Why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you,

and I can focus
on the desserts?

Mike, hey, it's Todd Harper.

Yes, I got the video
footage you sent.

Pretty sneaky of the network
to send me footage

of the people
you replaced me with.

Yes, very interesting.

I think we should talk
about my contract again...

and about Paige Marshall.

You're the one who
wanted an adventure.

s

at the club
in a couple of hours,

and then two days to finish our
"Off the Beaten Path" episode,

and then we are done.

What are we doing
tomorrow night again?

'Cause I was talking to
the bartender, and apparently,

they're supposed
to be this amazing meteor
shower tomorrow night.

So the stargazing
should be incredible.

Wow, unfortunately,
the schedule is locked.

I agree with Ben.

I think we should try and
include it, it sounds amazing.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Well, then, I will see
what I can do.

Yes. Thank you.

Where's everybody going?

Oh, it's the firework
show on the beach.
Happens every week.

Yes, I've
always missed it.

Hmm.
Well, then we should go.

Uh, we still have a couple
of things to talk about.

Yeah, I know, but
we won't be here when they
do it again next week, so...

That's okay. I'm sure I
can find a video of it.

And that's almost as good
as seeing it in person, right?

I'm kidding. Let's go.

Very funny.
See you guys.

Good meeting.

So if they agree to
keep us on permanently--

When they agree.

Have you thought about
where you'd like to go?

I mean, next season
is already set for Morocco,

but beyond that, the world
is our proverbial oyster.

I have no idea.

Truth is, I've never been
very good, planning ahead.

Okay, I can do
the planning for us both.

Good.

I can't wait to see Marrakesh.
Have you been?

No, but I would love
to go anywhere in Morocco.

Especially Casablanca.

I've seen that movie,
like, 200 times.

My favorite movie
of all time.

Me too. That's what made
me think of picking it

as the next destination.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Huh. What do you know?

Thank you.

For what?

For...

I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

Look, I realize I'm
supposed to be the expert

on loud things in motion,
but I'm pretty sure

you would've found
the fireworks even
without me.

-Not this.
-What?

I mean...

hosting
the show, Hawaii.

Okay, this might be
the bubble talking,

but... I feel different
since I've been here.

And a lot of that
has to do with you.

You're pretty good
at making people

step outside
their comfort zone.

Thank you.

Wow.

Hello, Millie?

I got your message--

Todd.

Hello, Paige.

What are you doing here?

Well, it's...
good to see you too.

Sorry, I didn't mean--

I just, uh... but
what are you doing here?

Well, it looks like I
didn't have to put together

a list of hosts for
next season after all.

You're coming
back to the show?

Well, we still have
a few "I's" to dot
and "T's" to cross,

but it's looking good.

I just wanna come down here
and meet with you both

and make sure we can all be
on the same page about this.

And if I happen to get a little
sun in the process, well...

How...
How did this happen?

I-I thought your contract--

You know how
negotiations can be.

Look, I thought it was over,
and I was okay with that.

I mean, let's be honest,
it had gotten a bit stale.

Stale?

But then the network sent
me footage of you and Ben,

and it made me realize
what was possible.

I don't understand.

You made it fun again.

The banter.
The back and forth.

I mean, who would
have imagined that

that quiet producer
who stayed in New York

while we were out doing all
the fun stuff had that in her?

Well, I think we're
gonna have that same kind

of chemistry too.

Mmm, wait-- you want me
to co-host with you?

Yes.

And I told the network it's
the only way I'd come back.

Uh...
what about Ben?

I'm sure he'll
land on his feet.
He's done it before.

Right.

Uh, if you just can
excuse me, please.

Paige! Paige, wait!

Did you know about this?

I knew that
they were talking,

but I didn't know what
had gotten this far

until he showed up
at my door an hour ago.

They can't just fire Ben.

It's a one-season deal.

It was always up to them
if there was gonna
be a season two.

I thought they liked
what Ben and I were doing.

They did, but Ben has
left this show once before,

and they were afraid
he might do it again.

And they know that
the viewers love Todd.

Then why keep me?
Why not just...

Fine, give the show
back to Todd.

Because he wants you.

And the network likes the
dynamic of having two hosts.

They think it works.

Yeah, it works because Ben
and I made it work, together.

Look, Millie, I didn't
even wanna do this
in the first place,

and I certainly don't wanna
do it now without Ben.

Well, Todd doesn't
wanna do it without you.

He will not sign the contract
unless you agree to co-host.

Now look at it this way:

You are in
the driver's seat now.

You can use this to
get them to agree

to pick up the show
you pitch them.

What if I say no?

You know, I just--
I need to find Ben.

-Hey, Ben.
-Todd.

It's good to see you again,
it's been a long time.

Yeah, wh-what are you
doing here?

You know, I'm a big
fan of Bold World.

Sure, I appreciate that,
thanks.

I love how you brought
the spirit of your show
to Next Destination.

We're going to try
and keep as much of that
as possible moving forward.

Moving forward?

I must say I'm really looking
forward to coming back

and co-hosting with Paige.

I hope that we're
able to recreate

what you two were able to do.

I'm sorry, you and Paige...

are gonna be hosting
Next Destination?

I know, I'm more
surprised than anyone.

I think most people have
forgotten about that
whole goat thing.

Anyways, we'll look
great together.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure you will.

So, no hard feelings
of course, I hope.

No, no, not at all.

Actually, there she is.

There she is!

Well, I'll get out of
your way so you two can
prep for the shoot.

And it's so nice
seeing you again.

Paige, let's all go out
and grab dinner and catch up.

Did you...

did you know about that?

Ben, I didn't want you
to find out like this.

Wow.

Well, I guess, uh...
I guess it is what it is.

I mean, it's probably
for the best, right?

No. No, it isn't.
Ben, you and me, we worked.

Yeah, I know, but
it's like you said--

it's the Hawaii bubble.

And it was bound to
burst at some point,

and I guess...
I guess it just did.

That's not--

And the truth
about it is that,

there is a great big
bold world out there
for me to explore,

so that's...
that's what I'm gonna do.

You know what? I-I need to
get ready for the segment.

So do you, so...
I'm gonna go do that,

and I'll meet you
back here, okay?
But it's okay.

-No.
-No, it really is, it's fine.

-I'm fine, I really am.
-Ben, wait.

Ben, can we talk?

Oh, hey, yeah,, actually I
wanted to talk to you too.

You never did change
the lines in the script.

You know, the last episode
where you say,

"Thank you for visiting
Hawaii with us,"

and I say, "We'll see you
at our next destination,"

only, obviously,
we won't be seeing anybody.

It'll be you and Todd.
So, I think we should
definitely change this.

Look, Ben, please,
I've been trying to get
five minutes with you.

Can we talk after?

No, actually,
right away after,
Luis and I are going

straight to the airport.

-We're gonna go to Australia.
-What?

Yeah, never been.
It should be fun.

Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

Todd, you're
coming with us?

Dressed like that?

Paige, you should
know by now

to leave the wardrobe
decisions to me.

Don't worry, you look fine.

You always did know best.

Ben.

You look great.

I thought we were
going to be at the beach.

Millie, you said water.

Water fall.

This better be worth it.

-Are you ready?
-Uh...

we were gonna change
some of the lines up.

We can just wing it.

Really, just wing it?

Okay, we're gonna wing it.
We're ready anytime you are.

Okay,
everyone, final segment.

Here we go, and action.

Welcome to Waimea Valley.

We're here at
the iconic waterfall

in this beautiful
tropical rain forest.

And if you time it just right,

you might be able
to catch the sun

shining through the mist,

which creates these
incredible rainbows.

And it's a beautiful
hike to get here as well.

My feet
can attest to the fact

that it is indeed
off the beaten path.

I told you to wear
comfy shoes. I told him!

When will I ever learn?

Well, Ben, it looks like this
is the end of our journey.

So it would seem.
What was your favorite part?

Oh, well, it's hard
to pick just one.

We went snorkeling,
saw some beautiful sunsets.

Ate some really good food.
Went to a luau.

We even danced.

Whoa. Hey, now,
one of us danced.

I don't know what
you were doing there.

That's not fair.
I'm a great dancer.

I had a lot of fun at the
dance with you, I really did.

Me too. Thank you.

And thank you.

We hope you enjoyed
our visit to Hawaii.

-I'm Paige Marshall.
-And I'm Ben Burton.

We wish you well
on your journey to...

your Next Destination.

Wherever it may be.

-And cut. That's perfect.
-I agree.

Um, we can do another
take if you want.

No, no, no, that's good,
that was it, that was the one.

Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

that is a wrap on
Next Destination: Hawaii.

Paige, great work.
You know, I was thinking,

we can script some of that
spontaneous banter you guys do.

Or we can plan out
what to say.

Todd, we can't plan...

Can we talk about this
later? I really...

You know, Millie was
talking about Morocco
for next season.

But what about Japan?

I think that might be of
more interest to our viewers.

Listen, I've got this
great idea, right? We start...

So, Luis, I gotta ask you,

are you sure you wanna
come with me?

'Cause I know that Millie would
love to have you stay on.

Hey, wherever you go,
I go, remember?

Thanks, pal.
I owe you one.

I got paid to spend
a few weeks in paradise
with my best friend.

I think we're even.

Listen, you know
what I was thinking?

When we get to Australia,

we should do a couple
of days of research.

You? Research?

It's just I don't want us
to miss anything, you know?

But that's not the Bold World
way, though, right?

What do you
worry about missing?

Paige.
I'm gonna miss Paige.

She made me better,
and she made me crazy, but...

she opened me up
in ways, I haven't been
in a long time,

you know that.

Its not gonna be
the same without her.

I'm not gonna be
the same without her.

Aloha.

Welcome passengers
on Flight 493,

nonstop to Sydney, Australia.

We're going to be starting
the pre-board process

in a few minutes.

Passengers may be seated...

Thinking about going up?

No.
 I'm just gonna live vicariously through other people.

Oh, honey, I think you know
that living vicariously

is not really living at all.

Yeah, I guess
I'm just not that good

at being bold on my own.

I kinda need....

And what would you
do if Ben were here?

I'd... I'd quit.

I'd say, "Millie I am
tired of pretending

like I have this great
plan for my life,

when I actually have no real
power to make it happen.

I'm tired of waiting for
other people to say yes,

when I wanna do
the things that I wanna do.

I wanna go snorkeling,
and UTV-ing,

and laugh along with the
people who are laughing at me

when I do dumb things.

And then I would...

go on a turn to Ben
and say,

"Let's go
and see the world."

Millie, I quit.

-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

Well, I-I didn't think
you were serious!

Do you really
need me to repeat?

No, I just, I thought
that was just musings.

Paige, as the executive
producer of Next Destination,

I have to tell you
that is totally unacceptable.

You made a commitment to me

and everybody that
works on this show,

and for you to just
throw that all away

without any regard to
the impact that it has,

it's both unprofessional,
and shortsighted.

What is this?

That is Ben's
flight information,

and if you hurry up,
you can still catch him.

I'm getting better
at this feelings thing.

What about Todd?

I'll just double
his wardrobe budget,
he'll be fine.

Go!

Then go!

Ow.

Hey...
that's a lot.

Thank you.

The flight to Australia.

What?

You missed your flight.

What can I say?

I wanted one last
Hawaiian sunset.

I heard you bought
a plane ticket

to try and catch me
at the gate.

Is that what you heard?

Oh, yeah,
that's what I heard.

Hmm.

So, what do we do now?

Oh...
I don't know.

-I don't have a job.
-Yeah.

I don't have a plan.

I don't know where I'm going.

I just hope that
it's with you.

You know what?
I've got a plan.

Come on, where are we?
Let me take this thing off.

No, no, not yet.

Okay. It's your show.

Well, we couldn't go
when we were in Hawaii,

so I thought we
would go now in...

Bali!

Oh, yes! Luis,
come on, come over.

You gotta see this.
Move forward.

I'm not
getting anywhere near

the edge of that platform.

Well, if you like this,

then you're gonna
love where we go next.

As long as I'm with you,
I know I'm gonna love it.

Whoo!
