...who took care
of those around him.

And l know that
in this time of sadness,

he would have been glad,
to know of the support

that his friends
have provided.

Those who are here...

A friend of yours?

A customer.
Well, ex-customer.

Oh.

How old was he?

43.

43? That's young.

What did he die of?

Blue ice.

Blue ice?
What is that then, blue ice?

He was sitting in his car
outside a warehouse

at Heathrow Airport

when this great big chunk of ice,
the size of a refrigerator,

broke off a jumbo-jet
toilet compartment

and crashed straight through
the roof of his Jaguar.

Stone dead.

Oh.

You're joking!

Would l be joking
stood out here,

Â£20 out for a wreath?

43? That's tragic.

Not really.
He was a violent bastard.

The only reason
he was at the airport,

he was planning
a cargo heist.

...the Son
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Harry.

You all right, luv?

Thank you for making it.

Sorry about this.
All right, mate.

Say, you was having me on,
wasn't ya?

No.

''Waltham Stoneman
dies in freak accident.''

'''Blue ice nothing
to panic about,'

says airline spokesperson.''

Oh, dear.
You never know, do you?

Out of a clear sky,

bang.

lt doesn't bear
thinking about.

Hello?
Hey, it's me, Kyle.

l told you not to call.
Listen, don't hang up!

lt's-- it's important, okay?

l don't need to see you.

l just want you to take
something down for me, okay?

Just hurry up, okay?
l haven't got much time.

X-P-L-A...

Kyle--
Yeah, just take it down.

C-l-F...

Refer number: CVH-7 43.

l do not believe this!

Look what you've done
to my bloody car!

What do you want me to do?

l might have known, a woman driver
talking on her bloody car phone.

Kyle...

Kyle?

Jeez.

Hello?

Kyle, are you there?

Kyle?

Finished our call now,
have we?

Can l help you?

Help me?
You've just destroyed my bloody car!

You see that?
That is a traffic light.

And when it turns red,
that means that the car in front of you

is going to stop!

Are you hurt?
Hurt? Oh!

Apart from whiplash
and a few broken ribs, l'm fine.

lt seems to me
the dent in my fender

cancels out your rear
broken lamp, so we're even.

Even?!
Bye.

Right!

What the hell do you
think you're doing?

Oh, hello!

lt's you again.

Let's say we look
at the damage you claim l did.

Fine.

See?

lt's just a nick!

The bumper's been buckled,
the brakelight's smashed,

the exhaust is split.

lt will still go, won't it?
Go? Of course it will go.

Well, l know you are
going to tell me-- Mister...?

Anders.
Harry Anders.

Well, Mr. Anders,
are you going to let me buy you off?

The correct course of action--
Oh, dear!

The bore-me-
with-procedure type.

l can't do it that way. The person who
owns that car would be very upset.

Oh, the person who owns
that car would be upset?

The person who owns this car
is bloody furious!

Mr. Anders,
my name is Stacy.

Would you like
to buy me a drink?

Why would l do that?

lf this argument's
going to be a long one,

l'd rather be somewhere
a little warmer.

Yeah.

lt's been a chilly
afternoon, hasn't it?

lf you send me the bill,
l'll pay for all the damages.

This guy you are involved with,
the one who owns the car,

are you that
frightened of him?

Nobody is frightened of Lewis.

He's a sweetheart.
lt's just that

it isn't exactly
my first accident.

And what does
''sweetheart'' do?

Goes to parties,
tells okay jokes,

and does what any
good diplomat does.

Diplomat? Oh.

l have a little problem
with diplomats.

Me and the Vienna Convention
have a few miles on the clock.

You don't seem like
the Foreign Office type.

l was...

sort of foreign office.

Refill?

You must know the owner
of this place pretty well.

You could say that.
He's a wonderful guy.

You?

l pay the bills,
and l get the headaches.

lt's the music
you really love, right?

A little blues,
or soul maybe?

Jazz.
Perfect!

Go on.

You don't make much money,

and the apartment upstairs
has a kitchen that's... too small,

and a bedroom
that's too big.

But after all the headaches
it's the one place

you value more than
anything else in the world.

l knew a girl like you once.

And l felt the same way about her

as l feel about you.

l didn't know whether
to love her or hate her.

So what did you do?

A little of both.

Evening, Harry.

A little early, aren't you?
Hi, Buddy.

That's Buddy,
the jazz piano player.

This is his rehearsal time.

He's a very bad
piano player.

lf he had a work permit
they'd kick him out of the country

but he doesn't,
so l'm stuck with him.

# Some day, we'll be
close together #

# Wait and see #

# Oh, by the way #

# This time
the dream's on me... #

l'd better go.
lf you go, you'll miss great jazz.

# And you look at me
adoringly... #

Stay.

# This time the dream's
on me. #

Here you are, sir.

You really do love it,
don't you?

There are easier ways
of making a living.

But jazz clubs are special.

l've got High Court judges
sitting out there,

alongside some of the worst
villains in London--

lords, hookers.

There's a guy over there
who drives a refuse truck.

There's a Chinese man
with one leg.

What do they all
have in common?

Loving jazz, like l do.

Tea leaf's been in again,
Mr. Anders.

Cleaned out three handbags
and a gent's wallet.

Not now, George.
All right, all right.

What's a tea leaf?
Thief.

Cockney rhyming slang.

Trouble and strife, wife.
Apples and pears, stairs.

So what are you going to do
with this tea leaf when you find him?

Break his dairy farm.
Arm.

Excuse me.
A bit of a squabble.

All right, lads, that'll do.

All right, leave the furniture
out of this.

How many times have l got to ban you
before you start taking me--

Shit!

You went for the stomach,
Harry. That's risky.

Hit a man in the chin
and he'll go down.

That's what my dad
used to say.

Your dad was right, but Ronnie
is a steady customer,

and you never hit
a steady customer in the face.

They don't come back
till their bruises are gone.

Do you like
all music, Harry?

Some of it.
Classical music?

Everything
except Schoenberg.

Schoenberg always struck me
as being a bit of a wanker.

l'll be in touch.

Bye.

Hm, looks a bit fancy, Harry.

Opera, the Covent Garden.

Opera? Not exactly
your speed, Harry. Who's it from?

You're beginning to sound
like my mum, George.

Don't be ridiculous.

Don't be too late
coming home, dear.

You're late.

But on account of that dress,
l'm prepared to forgive you.

Shh-hh.

Don't you just
love the opera, Harry?

You could say
l enjoyed it for the spectacle.

So where are we
going to eat?

l think l know just the place.

Wonderful ambiance,

great food...

Will it still be open?

24 hours a day.

How much longer?

l'd say about 14...

minutes.

l don't know how anyone
has the patience for cooking.

l can't handle
all that waiting.

Waiting, Stacy, is the key.

l remember my old man
used to say,

''Harry,'' he'd say,

''waiting is what cooking
is all about.

The longer you wait,

the better it tastes.''

l have a feeling
you're a wonderful cook, Harry.

l never met a man
who enjoyed waiting before.

Of course, a lot of what
my old man told me was crap.

You know what you are, Stacy?

You're blue ice.

Blue ice?
What's blue ice?

lt's when--

it's when
something unexpected

and wonderful falls on you
out of a clear blue sky...

and changes your life.

What a great image.

You know something?

You are a very interesting
person, Harry.

lnteresting?
Yeah.

Very.

Parachute Regiment?

Military lntelligence?

Northern lreland,
Middle East, Eastern Europe.

And in 1982...

compulsory retirement.

Should l be flattered?

Or do you do this much
research on everyone?

l have to be careful who l get
involved with, don't l?

You were a spy,
weren't you, Harry?

l adore you, Stacy.

And if l lie here long enough,

l'd probably tell you everything
about my life anyway.

But l don't like you digging
in the nooks and crannies of my past.

Why did they fire you?

The Czech agent
broke the rules,

he hurt the wife
of one of my sources.

They asked me to ignore it.
l couldn't.

So what happened?

l took him up onto the roof
of my office building.

And?
The Czech bounced.

l get a refill, please?

Hi.

Give me an hour, Harry,
and then we can sneak away.

l have to introduce some people
to the American Ambassador.

Of course you do.
l'll tell you what,

why don't l say hello?

lt's been a long time
since l've met an ambassador.

You want to?
Sure.

Okay.

Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

Lewis, this is Harry Anders,

owner of the best
jazz club in London.

l heard all about you, Harry.

ln my college days l used to play
a little jazz myself-- soprano sax.

Bechet.
Sidney Bechet, he was my hero.

Best soprano sax
player ever.

Harry, this is Lewis Mansdorf,
my husband.

Oh.

We seem to have
the same tastes, Harry.

Like minds, eh?

Great to meet you.

Now l gotta go and do
some gripping and greeting.

Please excuse me.

Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

You never asked.
He knows about us.

He does and he doesn't.

He chooses
what he wants to know.

l am having an affair with the wife
of the American Ambassador.

l could wind up
in the Tower of London for this!

Wouldn't l be worth it?

Oh, no...

What?

Oh, no!

l don't like that look, Harry.

That gloopy look.

Don't go soft on me, please.

Now what the hell
is ''gloopy''?

You don't fool me.
l know men like you, remember?

All that tough-guy talk,

and scar tissue
on the outside,

and hopeless romantics
on the inside.

Well...

it's nice to know that you have
such a high opinion of me.

lt isn't that.

This has to be
strictly temporary, okay?

Mm-hm.

Strictly Temporary
is my middle name.

Lovely steak today!
l've got some lovely steak!

Good morning, Harry.

Harry, l want to
ask you something.

l have a problem, l think, but l don't
know if l should involve you.

How fresh?

Today's catch, Harry.

You wouldn't try
to con me, would you, Marvin?

This sea-bass died
of old age.

Are you in trouble, Stacy?
Maybe.

Trouble is
my middle name.

l thought ''strictly temporary''
was your middle name.

ln England, we're very big
on middle names.

Tell me what
your problem is.

When Lewis and l came here,
l had an affair with an American.

He took the relationship
much more seriously than l did.

He started writing
these crazy letters, and--

l'm afraid the tabloids
might get ahold of one

and make it really
difficult for Lewis.

You want me to find this guy
and have a chat with him?

Well, no. l want you to find him
so l can talk with him.

You know, my fee
may be beyond your means.

l'm a very wealthy woman,
Mr. Anders.

l'm still gonna require
a down payment.

l drew a blank
with the lmmigration people.

Nobody of that name through
Passport Control in the past six weeks.

l checked the Special Branch
watch list. Nothing doing there either.

You and l should have
a word with the Yanks.

l know some of their
security people at the Embassy.

l don't think so, Ozzie.

This has got to be handled
with some finesse.

And finesse is not
one of their strong points.

Well, l do have an in
with a Fraud Squad guy

who works the credit card
beat, eh?

lf your man's in London, chances
are he's using genuine plastic.

Even if he's bought himself
a new passport.

Well, that sounds good.
Let's try that then.

Only it's, uh, 300 every time.

Well, he's got to pay off
computer people.

lt's highly not legal.

What's the commission
on your favors these days, Ozzie?

Eh?
Still 30%, is it?

Or have you
pushed it up to 50?

l wouldn't cheat you, Harry.

l hate taking your money.

l know, Ozzie.

You're a good old pal.

Oy! Oy!
Busted. Come here!

Harry, we got him.
We got the tea leaf.

Bastard!
Come here!

Watch your backs.
Stand away, luv.

Oy, you!

Don't be alarmed, that's just
part of the entertainment.

lt's a mistake!

lt's not what you think, Harry.
Honest it ain't.

What do you prefer, Westy,
playing cards or playing football?

lf it's cards,
l'm gonna break your leg,

if it's football,
l'm gonna break your arm.

Leg or arm?
Harry?

What?
l got the old Bill on the phone.

Tell him to wait.
The bloke says it's urgent.

Name of Osgood.

This is your lucky day,
Westy.

Let him go.

Are you sure it's him?
Close it comes as will be.

lt's the Villa Venetia,
Critchley line.

Southeast London.

He likes it here.

He's used his card four times
in the past 10 days.

The maitre d'
eyeballed him for me.

Stay on him.
l'll be there in 20 minutes.

Hello?
Write this down.

The Critchley Hotel,

station approach,
Southeast London.

Near London Bridge.
You found him.

Write it down, Stacy.

''Critchley Hotel,

station approach, near...

London Bridge.''

What do you
want me to do?

Just make sure
he doesn't leave.

l'll be there as soon as l can.

Hello, Ozzie.

Christ, Harry.
l never saw you coming.

You must have been
a good spook in your day.

James bloody Bond, mate.

Which one is he?

That's him-- good-looking kid
sitting on his own there.

There's gonna be
no rough stuff, is there, Harry?

l did this as a favor,
you know, off-duty.

You did this
for the 300 quid, Ozzie,

so don't give me
the Good Samaritan stuff.

That's the sort of place
where defrocked vicars

take young boys
and hang themselves after.

Keep an eye on him, Ozzie.
l wanna make a phone call.

Ozzie?

Ozzie!

Shit.

Osgood?

Osgood!

Jesus Christ!

Come on!

Fuck.

Critchley Hotel.

Want some milk
in that, mate?

A lot of milk.

Cheers.

You are in a world
of trouble, my friend.

l haven't done anything.

l've told you,
Ozzie was an old pal.

lf l thought--

l don't know who the American guy was. l
know nothing about him.

So who does?
l wanna help you--

You'd better had, friend, or you're
gonna get a smack in the gums.

Ozzie was a cop.
He was one of us.

No offense, fellas...

but l'd feel a lot
more comfortable

talking about this
at a higher level.

Nothing personal.

l don't smoke,

l don't drink,

l don't particularly
like women.

My primary pleasure

is writing my name on people's foreheads
with a baseball bat.

Let's go through
this again, Anders.

Who were you
working for?

For the last time,
l wasn't working for anybody.

l was doing a favor
for a lady.

Oh, yeah-- the wife
of the American Ambassador.

And if l thought she had
anything to do with it--

You'd do what?
Kill her too?

l didn't kill anyone.
You're lying.

l am telling you the truth.

How come when we checked
with the American Embassy, they said

they'd never heard of you, and told us
the American Ambassador's wife

had been in Paris
since yesterday evening?

They're lying.
Oh, they're lying.

The American Embassy is lying?
Mm-hm.

Not the crooked cheapskate
club owner who's found

with the copper's blood
all over his hands. Oh, no.

You're allergic
to the truth, Anders.

Lock him up.

We'll do this the hard way.

Open up.

Oy, you. Out!

Morning, Officers.
What a beautiful day!

l don't know who you've
got pulling strings for you, Anders.

But this isn't over.

l hate to see
an unhappy policeman.

l admire you.
Straight up, l do.

You've got big balls.

l couldn't put all my money
into a place like yours.

l'd be worried about
fire safety inspections,

keeping my drinks license,
drug busts,

add in a rap for letting
hookers use the place

in-between clients.

Now look what you've done.

You've frightened me so much,
l'm spilling my tea.

# Don't worry about me #

# l get along... #

How many more people
have l got to tell?

Anders, Harry Anders.

Mrs. Mansdorf is
not available--

lt's important.
l have to talk to her.

l'm sorry, sir, but she is
currently out of the country.

This is bullshit!

Afternoon.

l'm looking for the body
of one Kyle Belamy.

That's it.
Let's get out of here.

Thanks.

Stay close, stay close.

Oh, you shit! Move!

Down! Get in!
Get the car rolling! Move!

Go! l said go!

Go go go!

Take the gap!
Take the gap!

Don't fight it.

Right, now go.
Reverse.

An eye for an eye.

That's it.
Keep moving.

You sack of sweatin' soft git!

He's just tried to kill you!

Blow his face off! Kill him!

That's it. Well done.

Can we have
a tea break, guv?

Yeah yeah, fine.

All right, fellas!
Bring those two over here.

Tea break!

All right, lads,
that's an all clear.

A foreign banker in Brazil

is a very tempting target
for a kidnapper,

or a sickero from the favelas.

lf you don't get better,

you'll have a very short career
and come home in a wooden box.

Go and have a cup of tea.

Thank God the world
is full of bad guys, eh, Harry?

l'd never pay the rent
if they weren't.

Hello, Garcia.
How are you?

l'm all right. And you?

Yeah, l'm fine.

Maybe l went into the wrong business
when l came out.

Yeah, you wanna swap?

l'll have a nightclub any day.

You try teaching nervous businessmen to
be Machine Gun Kelly.

The hardest thing is teaching them
the killer instinct.

l had a problem with that.

You? Leave off!

You were one of the rare ones--
always had it, you were born with it.

Maybe, maybe not.

Have you got five minutes?
Yeah. Here, come in here.

He wired an alarm system
into his hotel room

so he wouldn't
be taken by surprise.

Either he knew the killer--
Or he thought he could trust him.

Or her.
You think the woman's involved?

l don't know yet. l phoned her
that night, but she didn't show up.

Obviously got mixed up
in something very dodgy.

Or somebody
you'd recognize again.

lt doesn't look very good
for the lady, Harry.

lt doesn't, does it?

The police were told to lay off?

They faked the inquest.

The body bag sent direct
to the United States,

courtesy of the U.S. Army.
lt's gotta be a spook, Harry.

Nobody else could pull
strings like that.

Do you know anyone
in the American Embassy?

Are you kidding?

l've got contacts
in the Secret Service, the ClA,

the N.S.A., the D.E.A., the l.R.S.,
Tobacco and Firearms,

and a few organizations
l don't even know the initials of.

Find out who it was,
and l'll take it from there.

What, just like that?
Yeah.

Harry Anders,

10 years retired and still
looking for trouble?

You think l'm rusty?

lt's been a long time, pal.
Here.

Let's see if l remember.

Dropped a stitch.

lf the nightclub
don't work out, Harry,

maybe you come see me, huh?

Great.

What do you think of them?
Looking good, Harry.

Great.
Good, huh? Don't you think?

Hi, Joe.
Hello, Harry.

Excuse me.

Um, the name is Stevens.

Um, you're Harry Anders,
aren't you?

Yeah. Have you been
here before?

Oh, yeah. Not as often
as l'd have liked.

Join me in a whiskey?
Sure.

Do you like them?
Yep.

The horn player's a bit rusty.
He keeps missing the bridge.

He'll warm up.

He always starts a bit tame.

You seem to know
your music, Mr. Stevens.

l've got a set of...

Kid Ory's 1921 recordings
on the Sunshine label.

As far as l know it's the only full set
in the whole of England.

The San Francisco sessions?

Yeah! Yeah, including
''Society Blues,'' yeah.

l am impressed.

Like a code, isn't it? Music.

Especially jazz.

You take the notes of the tune
and you change them

according to
the rules of jazz.

Stride piano, say.

And you hope
that the message,

the... melody still
comes through.

lt comes through if you
know how to decode it.

For which you have to know
how to listen, what to look out for.

Which is what happens
in life sometimes, isn't it?

Something happens-- puzzling
because you don't have the key.

You don't know the rules
of what jazz it is that they're playing,

so the music doesn't
seem to make sense.

You can't figure out
what's going on.

lt's just noise.

Who sent you?

To find that out, Mr. Anders, you just
have to follow the music, won't you?

l'm sorry, sir.
He's busy at the moment.

l don't care how busy he is, pal!

Get him! lt's a priority.

No no, he's gone now, sir.
Disappeared. Don't know where he is.

15 Mapleton Drive.

You've been here before?

Yep.

l once babysat a Russian defector
here for three months.

About 20 years ago.

He had very bad breath
and played with himself a lot.

l'll just go get us a drink.

Fine.

Hot chocolate.

lt's very warming
this time of night.

l never go to bed
without one.

So, what's going on?

l'm not a field operative as
you've probably already realized.

l understand you were,
and a very good one too.

Until you overstepped
the bounds...

got a bit too physical
on an assignment.

This isn't ''This ls Your Life,
Harry Anders.''

No.

So how come l'm suddenly
up to my ass

in British and American security
and intelligence guys?

Think of all that's been
happening as music, as jazz.

lt sounds jumbled.

Somebody upstairs is playing
a different tune entirely.

But if you listen hard enough,
somewhere...

somewhere in the middle...

you can hear the melody.

Where is everybody?

No problem, Harry.

Tell them
what they wanna know.

Problem?

Who's got a problem?

Let me give you
a piece of advice, Harry.

Let go of me, you fucks!

# Someday somewhere... #

# We'll be close together,
wait and see... #

You know your music,
don't you, Harry?

Don't let them hurt me!

# By the way #

# This time
the dream's on me. #

l think we're gonna
have trouble here.

Stop harassing me.
l didn't know he was an agent.

l just told him,
l don't know anything.

We're not gonna get
very far like this, are we?

You're lying.
Why would l be lying?

Why are you doing this?
lt's all a mistake!

You'll just have
to follow the music.

Tell them what
you did in there.

l run a jazz club.
My name is Harry Anders.

Come on, Harry, tell them.
My name is Harry Anders!

Don't know what you're talking about.
lt's so easy.

l do not know anything!

Respectful of the bloody training.
l do not know anything!

l do not know anything!

You know the rules, Harry.
l can't tell you anything.

Tell us what we want to know.

Tell us what we want to know
if you care about the girl.

Tell them what they
wanna know, Harry.

The horn player's a bit rusty.
Stop, l can't see.

You're a bit rusty, Harry.
You have to know how to listen.

Here we meet again.
Just fucking keep on doing it!

l can do it all bloody night
if l want! Now tell me!

l don't know anything!

Harry?

You're a bit rusty, Harry.

You're a bit rusty.
You're a bit rusty, Harry.

Fuck you!
C-V-H-7-4-3

You should have
told them, Harry.

Fuck you!
l don't know anything.

Bastards.

Hop in, sir.

Driving is not too bad there
this time of day.

We should make it
in 50 minutes nicely.

Do you mind if l--?

l do find it relaxing.

Helps the day go by.

We're authorized
to the lounge.

Carry on, sir.

We're here, Mr. Anders, sir.

The revised E.T.A. of the Minister's plane
is 11-0-0 hours.

l've made arrangements
to put the press conference

and the reception at the Foreign Office
back by three hours.

No.

A little breakfast,
Sir Hector?

Better make that breakfast
for two, l think.

What have you been up to, Harry?
You look absolutely ghastly.

l wish l could say
the same about you, Sir.

Being a lord suits you.

Oh, no no, just a humble baronet,
dear boy.

l never thought of you
as the humble type, Sir.

They felt l had to have something when
they put me out to grass.

Knighthood was probably
the cheapest.

Gave me compulsory
early retirement, you know,

into the protocol division.

l'm just a greaser now,
a handshake in a business suit.

Yes.

l've always admired
your handshake, Sir.

Very firm.

Are you waiting
for somebody now?

Yes, the Finance Minister
of Nepal.

You're joking.

No, l'm not.

Why don't you have some
double kidneys? They're delicious.

No, thank you.

Do you still have that club?

Just about.

l'll have to pop in there
one day.

Do that. Bring the Finance Minister
with you.

Tuesday nights
is Nepalese night.

Very popular.

Are you gonna tell me what
the hell is going on, Sir?

Or do l just
stand here guessing?

l had forgotten how insolent
you actually are, Anders.

The Americans are up to something.
They won't cut us in.

lt is thought
you might know.

l couldn't have been
asked nicely?

Did it have to be
done like that?

Now, l wasn't party
to that decision.

l'm just a handshake
now, remember?

Have some toast.

You recruited me,
and you ran me.

lf you're so far
out of the loop,

how come l'm here
talking to you?

That was rather
unnecessary, Anders.

Look, you're here
unofficially,

l'm warning you unofficially.

Just stay out of this.

Stay out of what?
This is all above my head.

All l know is that
you're a target.

l don't want you to be any more
of one than you already are.

l don't have to do what you say.
l don't work for you anymore.

l don't think you have
any choice, dear boy.

That's where you're wrong,
Sir Hector,

because l have all kinds
of choices.

l can go straight out of here around
to Grovener Square for example,

and kick up such a fuss that l get in
to see the American Ambassador--

with whom, as it happens,
l am on first-name terms.

And l could tell him that something stinks
in his embassy,

and that he ought
to know about it.

That would mean the embassy's security
staff got involved.

We don't want that.
Well...

as a matter of fact, Sir Hector,

l get on pretty well
with Americans.

They're looking
for you, Harry.

They want to talk to you
about Sam Garcia.

Before he was shot,
he was worked over with a knife

to see what he knew.

The Americans are very angry
with you, Harry.

You see, Garcia had
a lot of friends here.

My name is Stacy.

Would you like
to buy me a drink?

Harry, l'm so happy.

You don't fool me.
l know men like you, remember?

Come to bed, Harry.
All that tough-guy talk...

Harry, come to bed.
...scar tissue on the outside,

hopeless romantics
on the inside.

l think you'd better tell me
what the hell is going on.

Nothing is going on.
What are you doing here!?

l'm not here. l never was.

l just came to get my things.

Who was Kyle?
You just don't understand.

l understand that you used me
to get two of my friends killed

and every spook
in London on my tail.

You're hurting me.

l'll hurt you even more
if l don't get some answers.

Now who was Kyle?

He was my ex-boyfriend,
like l told you.

What l didn't tell you was...

he worked for Military
lntelligence.

Christ.

Then why didn't you even
show up at the hotel?

l did come to the hotel,
but it was crawling with police.

l knew something
must have happened.

You're damn right
something happened.

l couldn't get involved.
lt would destroy Lewis.

Fuck Lewis. You left me
to swing in the wind!

lt was me who got you
out of jail!

lt was because of you l was
there in the first place.

What was Kyle
involved in?

lt was some kind
of undercover operation.

Then something happened,
some kind of trouble.

What trouble?

l'm not sure.

He had this information,
but there wasn't...

anyone he felt
he could trust enough

to pass it on to.

So he called you?

Yes, but halfway
through the call

the line went dead.

l had to find him.
l had to know he was okay.

What information
did he give you?

''X-P-L-A, C-l-F

Reefer.''
Or, uh, ''refer.''

He was speaking so quickly,
l can't be sure.

That's when l banged
into your car.

That's exactly what happened.

''CVH-7 43.

KMF8.''

Have you any idea
what that means?

l don't have any idea.

You're the spy, Harry.
l thought you'd know.

l am so sorry.

l couldn't get
involved, Harry.

You aren't, Stacy.

What are you going to do?

l'm gonna find the people
who killed my friends.

''Ory's Creole Trombone''...

a collector's item.

What--

what is it you want?

What does CVH-7 43
KMF8 mean?

l don't know.

Try again.

l told you, l don't know!
You bastards know everything.

They train you to know--

Stop it, please!

You bureaucrats...

you're funny.

l never know
when you're lying!

You bastard!

What are you going to do?
Shoot me? You're crazy!

What was that all about
last night?

l don't know. A 40-D came down,
l just executed it.

Let's try that again.
l don't know!

Knee's next, Stevens.

lt has something to do
with illegal arms.

Um...

the Americans aren't--
uh, sharing.

People are getting worried.

lllegal arms?
Yeah.

That's all l know!

No! No!

That's all l know! That's all l know!
That's all l know!

Absolutely fascinating.

Thank you
for a lovely evening.

See you next week.
l look forward to it.

Bye-bye.

Sir Hector!

Sir Hector!

What the hell
are you doing here?

He shot me.
Get out of the light.

Quickly!

For God's sake,
what happened?

l just came around
to my flat.

He went crazy!

He shot me.
He could have killed me!

Why come here?

l can't go to the hospital
with a gunshot wound.

They'll report me
to the police.

l need a friendly doctor.

l know one. Have you got
a piece of paper?

l'll jot down
the address for you.

Goodbye, Stevens.

Harry...

Harry!

lt's gonna be all right.

Oh, Harry...

ls something wrong,
my dear?

Do you remember
Harry Anders?

The jazz club owner?
He's in trouble.

Anything l can do to help?

You are so wonderful.

l love you. You are always
so good to me.

l want you to make
a phone call for me.

Harry, where have you been?
l've been looking for you everywhere.

l know what Kyle was working on.
So do l, illegal arms trade.

No, Harry, arms shipments. He was
working undercover at the docks.

Docks?

X-P-L-A.

Export of London.

P.L.A:
Port of London Authority.

Oh my God, Buddy!
Buddy?

Buddy is in there?

You'll be all right, luv.
Just hang on.

Go back to the embassy and stay
there till l call, you understand?

Where are you going?

Stacy, stay there
and l'll call you.

l have been used--
Excuse me, sir!

--imprisoned,
lied to and blown up,

and l've decided l've had enough, Sir.
l beg your pardon?

ln case the bastards responsible
get me before l get them,

l want you to have this.
What is it?

l don't know exactly, Sir,
but l intend to find out.

lf l end up brown bread, l'm relying
on you to get that to the right people.

''Brown bread''?
Dead, Sir. lt's rhyming slang.

lf l end up dead, l'm relying on you
to get that to the right people,

and make sure that
whoever did me gets done.

All right, Sir?
l've got to get going.

Uh, Anders...

Ring, damn it!

To the docks.
Port of London.

Yes, ma'am.

Base, this is Security One.

We're moving proceeding west.
Roger, Security One.

Received and understood.

You with the police then, mate?
You'll be with the bloody

National Health Service
if you don't tell me what this means.

All right. X.P.L.A., Export--
Of London Authority.

l know that,
what about C.l.F?

Carriage lnsured Freight-- the load's
ready to be shipped immediately.

''Reefer,'' that's
a refrigerated container.

The rest of it is a serial number.
So where will it be?

Ah...

out there, mate.
With all the others.

Base, we've changed routes.
We're heading to the river. Over.

We're now approaching Waterloo,
do you copy?

Roger, stay in pursuit.

Look out!

Security One to Base.
We've been deliberately hit.

We've lost them.
Repeat, we've lost them.

Damn it, they got away.

Why isn't Gordon driving?
Day off, ma'am.

He takes Sundays off.

You just sit back
and relax, ma'am.

l see an unauthorized person
inside the perimeter. Over.

Received, we'll notify
security immediately.

l'm still looking. l think he's
gone to the east side.

Yeah, L-1 3, l see it.

Yeah, l'll come up and help you.
Roll up D-7.

Fine, l'll turn around
and roll back the other way.

There he is!

This is Car Two.
We're moving into Section D-7.

We're in pursuit. Over.

l can't see him. The farter's got
to be around here somewhere.

l'm looking.
l still can't see him.

Well, neither can l!

That's it.
Come on, we'll get him.

Transport to Seven,
please move to Cargo Area B.

Freight is now departing
from the north gate.

Attention, attention!

Unauthorized person
still on premises.

Report immediately
if sighted.

Report immediately
if sighted!

Come on.
You got it. Come on.

This is L-1 3.

l'm gonna turn
into Section G-4.

Still no sign of him.

Wait a minute.

l've got him!

He's in G-4,
heading west!

Repeat, G-4,
heading west.

l'm right up his ass!

Look at that bleeder run.

Shit!

We're moving up
behind L-14.

What do you
want us to do? Over.

Shit, l've lost him!

Say, ''He's over
the fence...''

He-- he's over the fence.

''...in the railyard.''

ln the railyard.

Drop the container.
Drop it now!

Christ!

L-14, do you copy?

Come in, L-14.

Go towards that ship.

L-14, do you copy?
Are you in pursuit? What's going--

Stay right where you are

or l will get very angry.

Okay? Okay.

Going on your holidays, are you?
Put the guns down.

Very slowly,
put 'em down!

You at the back,

put both hands
on top of the car.

So what's in
CVH-734 KMF8?

Warheads?

Nothing so glamorous,
l'm afraid, Harry.

High temperature
aerospace furnaces

for making missile
components.

My customers are looking
to upgrade their medium range

and battlefield
delivery systems.

Some lunatic in the desert
replenishing his collection of toys?

Oh, come on, Harry.

They were using
poison gas 75 years ago.

lt was our side that actually
dropped the bomb, you know?

Don't let's get
all moral about this.

lt's not a question of morals,

l'm just scared of being turned
into a french fry one morning.

How much are these things worth?
10 million, Harry.

But that's not the only reason
l'm doing it.

They fired me!

The pinstripes turned on me
like they turned on you.

We don't owe them
a damned thing, Harry.

Five million.

l can't do that.
We gave them everything!

What did they give us
in return?

A wet handshake with a director
on a Friday afternoon--

and he kept
looking at his watch.

Five million, Harry.

l really hate to see you
like this, Sir Hector.

l hate to see the man
who taught me everything...

end like this.

But l'm not going to end up
like this, Harry.

Yes, l should, uh...

l should have known that
you would assume

that you could get
the better of me.

You always were
an arrogant bastard, Anders.

Why don't we finish this
at Scotland Yard?

l don't think so, Harry.

Oh, l admit you
forced my hand,

made me start tying up
some loose ends.

lncluding the girl.

Stacy's safe.

Depends what you mean
by safe, Harry.

Let her go, and l'll
put the gun down.

Harry!

Are you okay?
Okay? Uh, yeah.

Billiards shot.

Gotcha! Stay there.

Okay.

# Oh, l do like to be
beside the seaside #

# l don't like to be-- #

Why you, Harry?

That's what l
couldn't understand.

You see, that's why
l couldn't kill her straightaway.

l had to find out how she knew

to go to you.

Why you, Harry?

Why you of all people?

Blue ice.

Just put it down
to blue ice.

Your time's running out, Harry.

l taught you...

l know all about you.

Oh, you're good.

But l'm better.

l'll always be... better.

How close was Sam Garcia getting
when you killed him?

Too close. He was beginning
to ask the right questions.

He had to go.

l liked Sam.

l like all you boys.

lt was never personal.

Even when you used
the knife on him?

lce pick, Harry.

lt goes deeper.

Well, Harry...

l'm afraid it's time
for you to be brown bread.

Nothing personal.

Whoa!

Harry!

Hut, hut, hut!

Present... arms!

Goodbye, Sir.

# Let there be me #

# Let there be oysters #

# Under the sea #

# Let there be wind #

# An occasional rain #

# Chile con carne #

# Sparkling champagne... #

Christ, Buddy,
aren't they suffering enough?

Have you no compassion
for your fellow patients?

# But most of all, please... #

# Let there be love. #

You look so deep
in thought, Harry.

l was doing
some serious thinking.

About what?

About the club.

l was thinking
about a new name.

lt was never intended
to call it ''Harry's.''

That just stuck.

l thought maybe... ''Stacy's.''

You know, more flash.

You're being very kind.

But you know that's not
such a good idea.

No?

Why not?

Lewis owns a couple of banks
the regulators are looking into.

We gotta get back
to Washington.

When?
Three days from now.

So you, uh... you won't be
staying on in London?

Not by yourself, say?

No, l can't.

Well...

''Harry's'' isn't such
a bad name after all, then.

l owe Lewis.

Way back when my life
was a complete mess,

he was there for me.

And as much as l love you,

and l do, Harry,

there's no way
l could ever hurt him.

That's okay, Stacy.

l wish it were different.

ln a couple of years,

who knows?

Yeah.

At least you'll always
know where to find me.

Third elbow from the left
at the bar.

Will you still
keep your promise?

What promise is that?

You said, when it was
time for me to go,

you'd have a glass of champagne
with me at the airport.

A promise is a promise.

l love you.
