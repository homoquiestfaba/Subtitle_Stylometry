We're dark. What the fuck?

What just happened?
What are you
looking at me for?

I don't know.
Come on! Do it! Fix it!

SAMANTHA: Seriously.
CRAIG: You are not doing it.

Fix it.
You're the computer whiz.

Come on, do it!

Well, what happened?

KANEKO: Hong Kong sewer
was just hacked.

Rerouting to Dubai,
Iceland,

Johannesburg, Rio.

And Barcelona.

Quadruple redundancy,
plus a spare.

Excellent work,
my precious ones.

Okay, it's on.

Did you see that one?

Oh, my God!

Hey! What?
That is so gross.

I so just came a little.
Right, yeah.

Oh, dude!
Follow him.

Closer.

Ready camera four.

Go.



Did you see that?
Oh, my gosh.


(ALL EXCLAIM)

Right in the back!

Oh, that was fantastic.
Right in the back,
are you kidding me?

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

I'm not betting
against Ripper anymore.

Now it gets
really fucked up.

Are you kidding me?
Like it hasn't been already?

Live or die.

Live or die.

All right, kill or stay?

Kill him. Kill him.
Kill him.

Why not, right?

I mean, dude,
he's lost us 100 bucks.

Let's do it.

Kill.

Kill, I guess.

LOGAN: Survey says...

Mr. Executioner,
come on down!

Finish him.

Now!

(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)


(ALL EXCLAIMING)

He didn't even cut it
off with the first one!

He didn't even cut it off!

God, this is
so gross, you guys!

This is so gross.

God. It makes me
giddy in my underpants.

Come on.

This isn't real,
is it?

No, no, it's like the movies.
It's special effects
and stuff.

Smoke and mirrors,
yeah, it's...

No, no, no.
No, I heard it was real.

I mean, if it was fake,
it'd be on TV.

What? You're so stupid.
Yeah, right.

There's no way.
Seriously.

My brother-in-law's
friend works for the FBI.

Says they're looking
for the guy that
runs this thing.

(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

Hmm. Hey.

Sorry.

That's better.

How did my
gallant warrior do?

Total slaughter.

No mercy given?

None taken.

What was the score?

A lot to a little.

Defensive struggle?

Always. You ready?

Yeah.

Thank you.

I was watching,
to be honest. I

You're gonna
miss these moments.

Waves of nausea
followed by crippling cramps?

Somehow I doubt that.

Okay, but when you're 50,

don't get all teary-eyed
reminiscing about
those pregnant days

and how you miss them.

You're such a man.

You think
you know everything,

but you know nothing of
the inner workings
of the female body.

But you still have
to give your opinion.

And expect everyone
to accept it as fact.

I know to bail on
this conversation.

Yeah. Good thinking.

David!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

You all right?
Yeah.

Lori.

Baby?

David, I'm sorry.



(SPEAKING SPANISH)

I don't speak Mexican,
senorita.

No sleeping in the bar.
You understand that?

Just give me
another bottle of...

Whatever it is
I'm drinking, okay?

Okay.

It's for you.

Where's the head at?

It's over there.

Yeah.

One more, please.

Hello.

Hey.

Where's my drink?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

I don't smoke.

But you do speak French.

What happened
to your face?

Life sucks. Scars happen.

You know,
this is the third bar
I've seen you in.

You like to
flash those big bills

or perhaps you have
a Mexican death wish.

You traveling alone?

What business
is it to you?

None, really.

But from what I saw
in there, I thought
we could make ourselves

not so lonely.

I hope you have
a nicer place than this
shithole to fuck your wife.

Not that I'm complaining.

I'm not married.

What? She leave you?

She's dead.

Then I guess
she won't be missing you.


I've got something
for you here.


Check him for
tracking devices.

If you find anything,
dump his corpse.

Make sure
you're not followed.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)




Hello?

Hello?

TAIGA: Shh.
Don't draw attention.

Who's there?

Over here.

Where am I?

Hell.

(SHUTTER OPENING)

THE EXECUTIONER:
What is the one thing
we all have in common?

Death.

The only questions are
how and when
the Grim Reaper will visit.

A problem you need not
worry about any longer.

This point forward,

your life isn't yours anymore.

It belongs to me.

You are no longer David Lord.

He ceases to exist.

Your name is Death Dealer.

You were bred to fight.

To kill.

And to die.

Who are you?

Do what you were born
to do, Death Dealer,

and your demise
will be one of glory.

Resist,

and I promise you pain
in the likes of which

you never could
conceive imaginable.

What do you want?

Help! Hello?

Somebody help me!

Let me out!

(ALARM BLARING)


Your name is Death Dealer.

What are you doing?

You were bred to fight.

To kill. To die.

Your name is Death Dealer.
You were bred to fight.

Kill. Death Dealer.
To die. To kill.

Your name is Death Dealer.
You were bred to fight.

Kill, kill, kill.
Your name is... Die.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

(ALARM BLARING)

(CAR HORN HONKING)

(BABY CRYING)

(DISTORTED NOISES)



So, what do we
know about him?

He's a fireman
from Denver.

I thought he was a doctor.

He has a
paramedic license.
He's not a doctor.

Family?

Wife, deceased.

KADEN: He's a fucking doctor.

At least the last guy
she grabbed was
a competitive kendo artist.

Well, this guy is
a fireman, okay?

Have you seen him?
He's, like, 85 kilograms.

186...
Milla.

He'll fight.

He's fucking useless.
He's a piece of shit.

It's so typical
of you, Milla.

My dear Kaden.

He's been in your
care for three days

and he's yet to give
you the time of day.

Maybe Kaden's
tired old shtick
won't break him.

I'll guarantee you
he'll respond to
a little honey instead.

Dirty, fucking whore.

He's my fighter.
I recruited him.

It's my risk,
my responsibility.

May I remind both of you
they are all my fighters.

And this is my world.

But you're
absolutely right, Milla.

It's your risk.

It's also your ass.

Well, heâ€™ll fight
and he'll win.

Do whatever it takes.

Just make sure he fights.

DAVID: What's your name?

TAIGA: You want
my real name or
the one they gave me?

The real one.

Mori. Taiga Mori.

I'm from Osaka.

You don't sound Japanese.

I studied architecture
at Harvard.

I'm...
David Lord.

Firefighter/paramedic
from Denver.

You hurt?

We're going to die here,
David Lord.

Nah, nah,
don't talk like that.

My wife, Akiko,

she used to say that
I was the strong one.

The survivor.
But I'm not. I'm weak.

I'm tired.

And I'm angry.

And all I went to do
is kill those motherfuckers!

Showtime.



Hold your breath! Hold!

Tough it up!
Tough it up!



(GREETING IN FRENCH)


You look like shit.

The magic cocktail
is already
whispering in your ear.

Why are you doing this?

What's your name?

David Lord.

What were you going
to name your child?

Leave my family
out of this.

Your wife, she's pretty.

Such a pity she's gone.

In the Marines,
how many men, women
and children did you kill?

No matter.

'Cause you aren't prepared
for what's about to happen.

Whether you live or die.

How will you live or die?

It's your choice.

What?

You want me?

I'd love to get
my hands on you.

That's the spirit.

No, no, no, no!


(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

New guy doesn't
stand a chance.

Yoshi.

We need to talk
about your TPS reports.

Yeah. The cover sheets.

I know. I know.

Ahh. Home again, home again.

And how are my two
beauties this fine day?

Ready to go.
Ready to go.

Magnificent.

Let's make something
special, shall we?

THE EXECUTIONER:
What is your name?

David Lord.

No. Your name is
Death Dealer.

Now I'm gonna
ask you again.

What is your name?

Input a six-second delay.

Link the video screen.

Ladies, if you will.

Lights.

Lay in graphics.

Marvelous!

Outstanding.
You've outdone yourselves,
my little pearls.

We are going live
in three, two, one.
Cue music.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not gonna fight!

Boring.


(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

What a coward.

If I was a betting man,
Milla, and I am,

I'd say you're
going to lose this one.

CRAIG: Oh, no.
Get up, get up, get up!

Ladies, please,
do something.

My lids are getting heavy.
I'm falling asleep here.

CRAIG: Yeah!

RICK: Oh, dude.

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

He's shit.

What?


Oh! Well, I'll be damned.

(BONE CRUNCHING)

Oh, my God!

It is now time for
the Fan-atics to vote.

Survey says...

Mr. Executioner,
come on down!

I'm a paramedic.
I'm gonna stop the bleeding.

What's he doing?

I've got a child.

I'm David Lord and
I've been kidnapped!


Cut the audio. Cue music.

Can you smell it?
It's just like sweetness.

Naughty boy.

Get him out of there, please.

And we are out
in three, two, one.

Brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant show.

You were marvelous.
And you were marvelous.

THE EXECUTIONER: Hey!

Stop right there!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

He's an embarrassment.
I should have cut him
In half there and then.

No, no, no, no!

You are not going
to kill him!

Yes, I am.

Kaden, be reasonable.

Reasonable?
This cunt deserves to die.

Yes he does,
but not this way.

It's wasted
if he dies off camera.

Fuck the cameras!

Kaden, where's your
sense of adventure?

He wronged me.

He wronged us!

Look, I want to hold his head
on the chopping block for you.

But we can break him.
We can make him fight.

We can make him
fight for us.

On our stage.

And if he won't?

Then you get your wish.
Fuck the cameras.



TAIGA: So, there we were.

Akiko got a headache
from the flight,

so she went out
to get some Aspirin.

That was the last time
I ever saw her.

Searched the city for days.

Contacted the authorities,
the embassy. Nothing.

There was no trace of her.

And then I got
a phone call.

It was the first time
I ever heard that voice.

And she said

If I ever wanted
to see my wife alive,

I should do
exactly what she says.

It's so fucking clichÃ©!

I should have known
something was up

when she never
asked for a ransom.

She told me
to go to this bar
outside the city.

To go alone.

But when I got there,

there was no Akiko.

Only that woman.

She's the same woman
that brought you.

Then I woke up here.

How long has it been?

A month.
Six weeks maybe.

When you never see
the sun rise or set,
how do you know?

Why'd they choose you?

Because I trained
with weapons all my life.

Have you fought?

Yeah.

It was either him or me.

We're all already
dead anyway.


(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

I brought you '
something to eat.

Why?

It's simple.

Satisfied?

You were lucky.
You won't be next time.

Why do you care?

I can help you.

I don't need your help.

Without me,
you'd be dead very soon.

What's in it for you, huh?

I recruited you.

You win, I win.


I know it must be
maddening for you,

but your situation
is hopeless.

Can't escape.

You can only hope to survive.

Who the hell are you?

I am that man
behind the curtain.

You're sick.

When I was growing up,
my father used to
stage these brutal,

bare-knuckle
fights in the backyard.

All these assholes
would come over
and drink and gamble

and cheer the winners
and spit on the losers.

Well, in my mind,

just watching
those poor fools lose
wasn't enough.

So I've upped the ante,
as it were.

I'm gonna kill you.
You know that?

What we have here

is a failure
to communicate.


I have always
wanted to say that!

I love Strother Martin.

Oh. Where were we?

Ah, yes.

The paradox.

You won't fight,

but you don't want to die.

But you will die,

if you won't fight.

You see our dilemma?

I won't fight.
Not for you.

Well, who would you
fight for? Your wife?

Oh, that's right.
She's dead.

Well, what would you
fight for?

Your freedom?

No, no, seriously.
I'll make you a proposition.

You give me,
say, 10 fights.

One down, nine to go.

I didn't kill that man.

Horribly mutilated
and left for dead?

Knowing he was
going to be killed, huh?
Shades of gray, David.

Shades of gray.

You give me '
an all-out effort,

nine more times and win,

and I'll let you go.


I'm witness
to kidnapping,
torture and murder.

I know your faces.

You really want me
to believe
you'll just let me go?

Well, you'll be
drugged and dropped

on some desolate road
in a Third World country,

yeah, but you'll be free.


And as far as you
knowing who we are,

you don't know shit.

Look, the FBI, MI5, Interpol,
all kinds of motherfuckers
are looking for us.

I don't fear
a fireman from Denver.

I give you my word.

Give me nine
more fights and win,

and, in the words
of Abraham Lincoln,

"I'll set you free!"

Fuck you! I'll die
before I kill for you.

Oh, I am sorely disappointed.
Crushed, really.

But I haven't
lost my appetite.


(SHARPENING KNIFE)

What is your name?

You expecting
a different answer?

Oh, Death Dealer.

How lovely it would be.

But first,

you must fight for me.

Or what?

You gonna kill me?

No. I'm gonna kill

her.

Your friend's wife. Akiko.

You have three minutes

to kill your opponent.

And by kill, I mean...

Off with his head.

You do that in
the allotted amount of time,

she goes free.

But you lose,

or you're one second
over three minutes,

I will slice her throat,

and bleed her like
a little fucking piggy.


You know, they say

you drown in your own blood.

Sounds like
a horrible way to go.

I'll take it that
you accept my offer.


Hey, dude, come here.

You're retarded.
Come on. Line up's up.

CRAIG: "White Samurai"?

Yeah.

He's only fought once.
He's kind of a pussy.

You're kind of a pussy.

I like the Dealer of Death.
JOSH: Death Dealer.

Whatever.
No, not whatever.

His name is Death Dealer,
that's what
you should call him.

Shut up, okay?


SAMANTHA: Oh, my gosh,
a damsel in distress.

Classic.

I love samurais.

Who doesn't?

LOGAN: Bring up the music.

Gently. Gently.

Now give me a breeze.

(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

Ah. Lovely!

Ninjas don't like samurais.

That's not true.
Ninjas and samurais
are like cousins.


Oh! Yeah.
Yeah!

That is disgusting.

I love it when
they get gruesome.

(BOTH EXCLAIM)

Do you think
he's gonna make it?
Yeah.

No, he's done. He's done.
No, he's hurt.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

What?
Awesome!


David.

Taiga. Taiga.

Taiga, no, no, no.

They told me
they would kill her.

I'm sorry.

JOSH: Safe.
That was insane.

I'm sorry.

THE EXECUTIONER:
The White Samurai
fought with bravery.

But was unable to
defeat his opponent.

And unable to
save his princess.

That was a little gross.

I'm sorry.

There's nothing I can do.

THE EXECUTIONER:
Why are you letting
this man suffer?

End it. Kill him.

Kill him now.


(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Awesome!

Fade music.

Fade graphics.

And we're

out.

(LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY)

That was astounding!

Kudos to us all.

You said he would
fight, Milla,
and fight he did.

My money, please.

Ladies, will you please
wire Milla's winnings.

Kawaii.

A little something extra.

You've done
exceedingly well, Milla.

Your fireman from Denver
may turn out
to be a rainmaker.

DAVID: Hey

You.

The one behind the curtain.

Yes.

I accept your offer.

I will give my absolute best
for another eight fights.

On one condition.

And that is?

The last fight,

I want him.


Those are my terms.

You don't like them,

then we're done with
this bullshit right now.

You are not going
to kill yourself.
You're bluffing.

You don't think
I could beat him.

Please, it's a nonissue.

No one's ever survived
five contests, let alone 10.

People want
to see me fight.

I want to fight.

Well?

What's it gonna be?

That's up to you, Kaden.

And what if he wins?

You know I'd never
allow that to happen.

We accept your offer,

Death Dealer.

(BREATHING RAPIDLY)


They're moving you
into another room.

I'd rather have antibiotics.

I can get you those.

What changed?

You fought.

You mean, I won.

So what?
Now I'm your prize pig?

How much is your cut

of the death of
another innocent life, huh?

Do you want
the antibiotics or not?

Yeah, I want the antibiotics.

And something to sew it up!


DAVID: Watch the muscle,
watch the muscle.

Right there.

(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

Wider stitches, okay?

Very good.
Pull the skin.

Pull the skin.
Pull it tight.


Fuck.

Yeah, yeah.

Looks like
you're getting better.

Better enough to fight.

Exactly.

Thank you.

Really.



Yeah, we sure do
like a whipping.

But nothing

like a pussy-whipping.

(DOOR OPENING)

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)



Hey, check this out.

What's up?

Oh, dude.

Yeah.

Hell, yeah,
Death Dealer
will be all over him.

You think so?
Definitely.

He's gonna kill him.

The Executioner's
big guy.

What'd you do
to your hair?

Just trying something
a little different.


I am David Lord.

LOGAN: (WHOOPING)
Yeah! Yeah!

Oh, my goodness!

He is every bit as good
as you were in your prime.

You know, just
say the word, partner.

We can call this off.



My name is David Lord.
And in one more fight,
I'm gonna kill you.


That was amazing, my man.

Bravo! Bravo!

Better watch your back.

He may have
found himself
a new favorite.

We've got a situation up here.


Brutus Jackson,
who terrorized
South Africa 12 months ago

by going on
a drug-induced rampage,

killing 14 people,
has escaped.

Jackson was being transferred
to the death row
facility at Pollsmoor

when the transport
carrying him was
brazenly ambushed

just outside
the Robben Island Prison gate.

The three guards
escorting Jackson
were found dead at the scene.

Local authorities
have no further
information at this time.

Are you out of
your fucking mind?

I don't see
the problem.

The whole universe
is looking for us

and you pull
a stunt like this!

You kidnap
a world-famous
serial killer?

Spree killer.

You might as well
drop a trail of bread crumbs

leading law enforcement
to our door!

Come on.
The deadbeats
are boring.

All the mind fucking
in the world

can't help someone
who's physically weak.

Listen, and this guy,

he is a monster.

He is ready
to kill again.

Think of the added revenue
when our audience
sees that it's him.

No longer will
anyone be able to claim
that our fights aren't real.

You're afraid of him.

Yeah, and you will be, too,
once you get up
close and personal.

No, no, no, no.
Not the serial killer.

You're afraid of
the fireman.


You are hurting me!


What?

How did you come
to be their hostage?

That's funny.

Let's just say
my family wasn't as
pleasant as they are.

Certainly with less reward.

Kaden's afraid of you.

He brought in
some professional,

some maniac
from South Africa.

Come back alive. Please.

Just two more
and at least one
of us will be free.

You know they
won't let me live.

I have a brother, Sam.

We haven't spoken
since the accident.

I tuned out
everyone I ever loved.

He probably doesn't
even know I'm missing.

Or that I'll soon be dead.

Wish I had been
a better brother.

Now I want closure,
you know?

So have you guys
done that whole,
you know,

college threesome
thing yet or...
Dude.

You're never gonna
believe who
Death Dealer is fighting.

Remember that
South African
serial killer guy?

Yeah.
The one who escaped?

Yeah.
Yeah. Him.

Tonight?
Now.

It was nice meeting you guys.
Have fun.

ALL: (CHANTING)
Death Dealer! Death Dealer!

Oh, my God.
Sacagawea!

Kill the man!
Yeah!

God damn!

Where'd he go?

Kaneko, Kawaii,
can one of you find him?

Having a little
bit of fun now,
aren't we? Yeah?

Well, you ain't seen
nothing yet.


(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Yes! All day long, yeah!

God, this is so awesome!

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

Got a lot of fight in ya.

It's pointless,
although it's noble.

That's nice. Very nice.

Very, very nice.

(BONE CRACKS)

Payback's a bitch, huh?

It's been nice
knowing you.

Yeah!

Oh, my God!

That was
frickin' awesome.

(ALL WHOOPING)


Fade music.

Titles.

And we are out.


MAN: Hello.

Talk or I hang up.

Hi, I'm looking
for Sam Lord.

Who's calling?

I have a message for you
from your brother, David.

From my brother, David?
David Lord?

Who is this?

I'm just a friend.

Is this a joke?

No, no, he wanted me
to tell you something.

My brother's dead.

Not yet, but soon.

He's dead to me.

(DISCONNECTS CALL)

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Can you help me?

(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

JOSH: He just owned that,
you know?

MAN: Game's on in 10 minutes.

You can't just, like...

If you hold it too long,
it's like sitting on
the pot and not shitting.

Well, well, well,
the Wizard himself.

To what do I owe
the extreme pleasure
of this surprise visit?

Well, fireman,
you got your wish.

Any thoughts to
what you're gonna do
when you're free?

So how's it gonna come?

How's what gonna come?

All right, okay,
so you know.

Here I had this
speech prepared
I was gonna give, but...

I had the lab whip this up.

Genius little concoction.

Takes about
20 minutes to kick in.

It won't kill you.

Just throw you off
your game. Teeny bit.

Can't have our
fans feeling like

they got ripped off,
now can we?

They've come to expect
great things from you.

You and Kaden,
you're both just cowards.

No. No, only me.

Kaden may be
a lot of things,
but he's not a coward.

You are really
great in there.

It's like you were
born to do this.

You know,
there is another way.

You could stay and
achieve true greatness.

Let's just
get this over with.

May I?

I told you I'd kill you.

After I'm done with Kaden.

Good luck with that.

Your boyfriend dies tonight.

So gonna whup his ass.
Here we go, here we go.

Run for it!

(ALL CHEERING)

Come on, Kaden.

Come on.

These guys are horrible.
God, stop.

Lori. Lori. Lori!

I don't know how it happened,
but your cover was blown.

Probably a retaliation
for the Korean sanction.

Hi, I'm looking for Sam Lord.

Who's calling?

I have a message for you
from your brother, David.

From my brother David?
David Lord?

Ready the men.
We have a location
on Agent Searle.

LOGAN: Come on.

Come here, you.

You ready to die,
Death Dealer, huh?
Ready to die?


They've got a website.
Death Games.

Real fucked up shit.

But they're no
two-bit operation.

Their online security
is flawless.

So their origins are unknown
and so far untraceable.

So is the money trail.

Dead end every time.

I'd be lying
if I didn't tell you

that this is the closest thing
there is to a suicide mission.

Are you sure?

I want this assignment.

Give it!

Kill him.

That's quality action
right there.

Who are you?

My name is David Lord.

David Lord. David Lord.

Your cover name
will be David Lord.

You're a firefighter
and a paramedic
from Denver, Colorado.

My name is Death Dealer.

No.

I was bred to fight.
To kill.

I made you.

And I will end you!

No.


Why and how in the fuck
is he still standing?

Can you help me?

Why are you smiling,
you conniving bitch?

Do you realize what you...
BOTH: Logan!

(RAPID BEEPING)

You know what to do.


ALL: (CHANTING)
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!


(BONE SNAPS)

(ALL CHEERING)

Kill, kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill!

DAVID: Going somewhere?

I could have
killed you months ago!
I protected you!

Somehow I don't
feel protected.

Look, I can give you
more money than
you could ever spend!

I'm sure you could.

Here, take It!

SOLDIER 1: On the ground,
on the ground,
get on the ground!

SOLDIER 2: Room's clear.

I never murdered anyone!
It was Kaden, he's the one!

And your hands are clean?

Cleaner than yours!

You can't make
somebody change, David!

You murdered those people
because you wanted to do it!

All that bullshit
about brainwashing!

You didn't have to do it!
You wanted to do it!

It's who you are,
it's who you've always been!

We're the same,
you're just like me!

So tell me,

since we're the same,
what am I about to do?

(GUN COCKING)

No! No! No!


Drop your weapon
and get on your knees!
Drop your weapon!

Drop your weapon!

Agent Searle?

Agent Searle?

Agent Searle,
it's good to see
you made it.

I'd almost given up hope.

I killed all those men.

It's okay, son.

They were already dead.

The important thing
to remember is

that you saved
countless others.

One of them is still alive.

Find him.

We will.

We'll find him.
I promise you that.

She's the only
reason I'm alive.

Don't worry
about her, David.
She's in good hands.

Her kind,

they almost always
end up on their feet.
Come on.

â™ª Shouldn't be this hard

â™ª At the seams, I fall apart.

â™ª The world to me is dark

â™ª In it I've bled
a liar's heart

â™ª I wear this halo

â™ª And it sets my soul on fire

â™ª All I hear are the echoes

â™ª And the chills
run down my spine

â™ª Times like these I get tired

â™ª Living a life uninspired

â™ª I've been told
it'll soon pass

â™ª Get out your head

â™ª You're on the right path

â™ª The more I doubt
the further away I get

â™ª From the voice I need

â™ª I wear this halo

â™ª And it sets my soul on fire

â™ª All I hear are the echoes

â™ª And the chills
run down my spine

â™ª I've been told
I'm going blind

â™ª When l never want
to see you again

â™ª Now I see I can't pretend

â™ª Who I am
or where I've been

â™ª I live a life
that never ends

â™ª I wear this halo

â™ª And it sets my soul on fire

â™ª All I hear are the echoes

â™ª And the chills
run down my spine

â™ª I wear this halo

â™ª And it sets my soul on fire

â™ª All I hear are the echoes

â™ª And the chills
run down my spine â™ª
