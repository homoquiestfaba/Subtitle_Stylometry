Let's go.

Crybaby.

Mia! Mia!

Where are you, mama?

Back here.

Hey, hoW Was school?

Great!

Miss Reading said I
Wrote the best story.

What Was it about?

It Was about a little girl
Who got lost in the Woods,

Who managed to
find her Way home.

Oh.

So hoW did you do on
your spelling test?

Aced it.

That's my girl.

Thank you for the help.

I made some cookies.

You Want some?

Chocolate chip?

<i>Yep.</i>

Race you

Oh, you little...

So, tell me again
hoW you and daddy met.

Well, honey,
We met in college.

I'd been given a full
scholarship to Evergreen.

In NeW York?

Mm-hmm.

Upper NeW York.

We met in the student union.

I thought you said you
met in journalism class.

You knoW,
you're right.

We met in class and
then We Walked over

to the student union.

And he fell for you
the moment he saW you?

Well, I don't knoW about
that, honey, but I certainly

Was very interested in
him When We first met.

Go on.

Well, let's see.

He Was a senior and...

You Were a junior.

That's right.

We dated for six months and
he volunteered to go to Iraq.

We got married right
before he shipped out.

He never came back.

<i>(Mia)
Please don't.</i>

<i>I won't tell anybody,
I promise.</i>

<i>(female)
Shut up!</i>

That's right, honey.

Never did.

HoW's life treatin'

Good.

Mom made cookies.

Yum!

Maybe you should sell
these at the caf√©.

Yeah mom.

Everyone Would buy them.

Miss William's cookies.

Sounds good.

Well, got to go play.

AIWays looking
out for me, huh?

What are friends for?

No, you the one
keep me afloat.

There Were lots of people
that kept you afloat.

Not just me.

'Sides, Who Wouldn't help
a neighbor that just lost

a father and a husband?

Did you see What Melinda Sue
had on at church Sunday?

Mm-hmm.

Girl doesn't have
a brain in her head.

Yeah, Well, Melinda Sue
doesn't need a brain

the Way she looks.

I guess that's right.

Men.

All they care about's
What's on the outside.

Dear God, thank you for
everything that happened to me.

Please keep my daddy safe.

Please let him find me one day.

God bless Mom and Maxine.

In Jesus' name I pray.

Amen.

<i>(female)
Mia!</i>

<i>(female)

<i>Can't wait to be

Any place that Would let me
cover the real neWs and travel.

So meet any nice
boys this semester?

Mama, Who's got
any time for that?

Well, somebody better

Otherwise, all the good ones
Will be gone and you'll

Mama,

Oh, you knoW What I mean.

Yeah.

So promise me that you Will
accept if somebody asks you out.

Okay.

Okay, sure.

HoW many plates

Let's see.

Mr. And Mrs. Lensley are still

back, so that Would be five.

I knoW What it takes
to make me beautiful.

I knoW What it takes
to make me smile.

And I Want you to...

[screeching and crashing]

I can hear the sound
of your voice fading.

You say the Weather's

[sirens sound in background]

[Phone ringing]

ArroW Lake

Some guy ran

<i>She swerved to miss him,

It's just not right.

She never hurt anyone.

Do you have Wireless
Internet available?

Yeah, just click

I noticed a feW
people fishing out there.

You Wouldn't happen to have
a spare pole, Would you?

We've got some poles in
the storage shed out back.

Just help yourself.

Thank you.

Oh, excuse me.

Could you have the bellman
bring in my bag, please?

<i>Frank, how are you?</i>

Yes.

Just Want to make sure...

Well, We'll need you

That's a lovely idea.

I'll bring some When
I bring the clothes.

Excellent.

I'll see you this evening.

She'll be in room tWo.

I've never seen anyone

<i>Your mother was very

Yeah, she Was.

Excuse me.

Running a little late.

No, you're

It's Bob and Laney's

Oh, congratulations.

Thank you.

<i>(Mia)
And they spent their

And this is Edie.

<i>She stays here about once
a month when business</i>

brings her nearby.

I'm Daniel.

Nice to meet you.

What brings you to toWn?

Actually, I'm here
checking out the local paper.

Why's that?

It's just What I do.

I acquire papers
for a living.

Mia, maybe this guy can get
you a job When you graduate.

<i>(Laney)
You know, she's at the top of
her class and quite a writer.</i>

I think she's going to be
a famous author someday.

Well, if she can Write
half as good as she can cook,

she's hired.

You really ought to
read some of her stories.

What do you Write, books?

Not yet, but I have
a lot of short stories.

So Daniel, hoW many
papers do you oWn?

Right noW We're at 18,
but Who's counting?

Any of them in NeW York?

Well, We've got
five in NeW York.

My mom Went to
school in NeW York.

<i>(Bob)
You should read Mia's story
about the motorcycle guy.</i>

It's tremendous.

You knoW, if you have
something you'd like me to see,

I'd be happy to.

Yeah, I'll put a feW
things in your room

What you Want to read.

Well, you'll

I'm sorry to be rude, but I'm

Thanks.

Nice to meet you.
You too.

Excuse me, can you tell

Thirty-five north,
thank you.

Hey, can I ask
you a question?

What is it?

Have you ever
been to Iraq?

Actually, yes.

I Was in the press corps.

I noticed you
don't Wear a ring.

Have you ever been married?

Are you okay?

<i>You know, look, this
isn't really my place,</i>

but I lost my mother
When I Was your age.

It Was one of the hardest
things I ever Went through.

If there's anything I can do,
you let me knoW, all right?

Thank you.

<i>(male)
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.</i>

<i>That's what the Bible says.</i>

<i>Sarah is God's child and
he's there to greet her.</i>

I have no doubt of this.

<i>God, grant Sarah's loved
ones the strength they need</i>

<i>to cope with their loss.</i>

<i>Through Christ
our Lord, amen.</i>

Amazing grace

<i>how sweet the sound</i>

<i>that saved
a wretch like me</i>

<i>I once was lost</i>

<i>but now I am found</i>

<i>was blind, but now I see</i>

Looks good.

Thanks.

Excuse me.

Hi.

If there's anything I
can do, just let me knoW.

I'm Daniel Williams.

What are you doing here?

<i>(Mia)
Maxine.</i>

Seriously, did
you even knoW Sarah?

No, but I'm here
to support Mia.

She has plenty of support.

I can see that.

Maxine, What
Was that all about?

I thought she
made all that up.

You thought
Who made What up?

Mia, noW's
not the time.

You okay?

Yeah.

Nice car.

What happened there?

I got tangled up
With a deer.

Not that it's any
of your business.

You knoW, you're
a real piece of Work.

HoW could you leave her
in a lurch like that?

Excuse me?

You don't look like a guy
that couldn't afford a Wife.

What are you talking about?

You knoW What I'm talking about
and don't play innocent With me.

Sarah Was my best friend.

I never met Sarah!

What the heck's Wrong
With you people?

The nerve of
that guy shoWin' up.

Who is he?

You don't Want to knoW.

It's me, Sally.

Of course I Want to knoW.

He's the guy that left
Sarah pregnant and broke.

You're kidding.

No.

NoW, hoW do you
knoW he's the guy?

Look at him!

NoW look at Mia.

Lots of people look alike.

It could be, I guess.

I'm telling you
this is the guy.

His name's Daniel Williams.

He's from NeW York.

That's the name of
the guy that Sarah married.

"Bronze star Winner
Daniel Williams

"Was declared
missing in action

last Saturday, the 23rd,
by his commanding officer."

<i>(Sarah)
We got married right
before he shipped out.</i>

He never came back.

That's right, honey.

Never did.

So Welcome back.

Let's get started.

Code of ethics
for journalists.

Can anybody tell
me What that says?

To seek the truth
and to provide a fair

and comprehensive account
of events and issues.

Very good, Mia.

But What does it say
about plagiarism?

Don't do it.

All right, tWo for tWo.

<i>(male teacher)
Don't sweat it.</i>

Just get the extra credit done,
bring it back to me next Week,

and We'll get it going.

You'll be fine.

Hey, What's up Mia?

I got something
I Want to ask you.

I am listening.

HoW Would I go about
finding information on someone

in another state?

I'd start With
publicdata.com probably.

And What can I find there?

You could find out
Whether the person's got

a criminal record,
Whether they've been sued,

Whether they drive too fast.

Can I find out Whether
they've been married?

Not there, no.

But each state keeps
marriage license records,

so the county clerk's office
is Where you Want to check.

Thanks.

You bet.

See you next Week.

Take care.

<i>(Mia)
Hi, my name
is Mia Williams</i>

<i>and I'm looking for
a marriage license between</i>

<i>a Daniel Williams
and a Sarah Hart.</i>

Do I have the right office?

<i>(female)
You do.</i>

<i>What did you say
their names were?</i>

Daniel Williams
and Sarah Hart.

<i>What day was the wedding.</i>

I'm not sure, but it
Would have been someWhere

in September of 1990.

Okay, that'll take
a little time to research.

Can you call me back
in about a Week?

Sure.

Hi.

Hi, I'm trying to find some
information on my father.

When Was he born?

I don't knoW.

But he married my
mother in 1990.

That's a good
place to start.

Let's take a look at
the Austin neWspapers,

see if there's
a Wedding announcement.

Okay.

You knoW hoW to
use one of these?

Yeah.

I'm majoring in journalism.

Well, if you need me,
I'll be at my desk.

Thanks.

Are there any
other files here?

We have birth and
death certificates

from the health department
on computer noW.

<i>Think that might help?</i>

No.

Thanks for trying.

<i>Any time.</i>

Linder, NeW York.

I need the number for
the registrar's office

at Evergreen College.

Hi, yes, I'm checking to
see if a Daniel Williams

attended Evergreen in 1989.

Yes, I'll hold.

I've called every county
200 miles outside of NeW York

and Austin and no one has any
record of their marriage.

HoW can that be?

Maybe they eloped to some
exotic place like Niagara Falls.

Of course.

That's it.

So there's nothing in any of
the papers about a Wedding

betWeen a Daniel Williams
and Sarah Hart.

<i>(female)
We've checked
thoroughly, ma'am,</i>

but there are no Weddings
under that name.

<i>We are checking to see if
there's a change of name</i>

<i>petition on file.</i>

Do you think that'll help?

No thanks, but
thanks for trying.

Okay, good luck.

<i>(male)
I found a Williams.</i>

Great, but I don't
need this anymore.

Hey.

Hey.

HoW's the neWspaper
business today?

You knoW, the stats on
"The Observer" look pretty good.

You going to make them
an offer they can't refuse?

Something like that.

You knoW, I haven't been fishing
since I Was a little boy

With my father.

Forgot hoW much I missed it.

HoW you doing?

Okay.

It gets a little
easier every day.

What are you
going to do noW?

I don't knoW.

I think my mom Would have Wanted
me to do What makes me happy.

What makes you happy?

Writing stories, but
it doesn't pay the bills.

Well, sometimes you can make
a little money selling a story.

There's not much of
a market for short stories

and that's all I've got.

All these stories you've
Written all on one topic?

Sort of.

They're all about me.

Maybe you can put 'em
together, make a book out of it.

Yeah, maybe, but that
Would take a lot of time.

There's one thing you've
got on your hands, girl.

It's time.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

<i>But how do I eat if I
shut this place down?</i>

You're gonna have to figure
out some Way hoW to do both.

Did you go to
Evergreen College?

HoW did you knoW that?

I googled you.

I like to knoW a little
something about my guests.

Oh, really?

You just google
all your guests?

Did you find something
out important?

You like to ski
and climb mountains.

And you Won an aWard for
neWspaper man of the year.

That's pretty good.

You like to ski?

Never tried it.

What about climbing?

You like to climb mountains?

But I love neWspapers.

You love neWspapers?

Well, We've got something
in common, then.

<i>Whoa!</i>

Oh, yeah!

Get the net!
Get the net!

Look at that guy!

Look at that baby.

Look at him.

Look at him!

Whoo-hoo hoo!

Whoo-hoo hoo hoo!

Look at that thing.

SWeet!

HoW do We make
them go faster?

Ho, Whoa!

You really
Want to try that?

Please?

That Way.

Whoa!

Oh, sure,
let's go riding.

Of course, you'll
never Walk again.

That Was fun.

Does the pain
stop eventually?

Huh?

Maybe.

Go ahead
and laugh at me.

I'm getting
too old for this.

<i>(Mia)
I think he's my dad.</i>

<i>(Maxine)
What makes you think that?</i>

<i>He was in the Gulf War.</i>

<i>He looks like me and he
was in the press corps.</i>

<i>Lots of people
were in the Gulf War,</i>

<i>even in the press corps.</i>

But they all didn't go to
Evergreen College

Where Mom Went.

Even if he Was your dad,

Why Would you Want
anything to do With him?

He left your mother and you

to fend for yourselves
all these years.

Maybe he got amnesia When
he Was missing in action.

It happens.

Maybe.

Maybe not.

He seems just like the guy
Mom used to tell me about

When I Was little.

You better
go sloW, Mia baby.

Men don't like being
accused of fathering

a child they
never kneW about.

I Will.

I Won't say anything
unless I've got some proof.

But really, I mean, Why Would
a guy like that be staying at

a B&B unless he Was my dad?

He'd be staying at the Four
Seasons in Austin, Wouldn't he?

Maybe he just likes
being in the country.

<i>(male)
Hey girls.</i>

Hey Travis.

What'll it be?

I feel like
a chocolate malt today.

Boy, you sure
don't look like one.

Be right back.

So hoW's the prettiest
girl in Arroyo Grande today?

Not bad.

Still got that neWspaper
guy at your place?

Yeah.

Don't like him.

He's nice.

Don't trust him.

You're sittin' on a gold
mine With that land

your mother left you.

NoW, there are going to be
people Who are gonna try

and take that from you.

He's nice once
you get to knoW him.

Don't trust him.

Well, you don't knoW
anything about him.

Well, I knoW he looks like
a man that left your mother.

Did you meet my father?

No, but this guy is either
him or it's his tWin brother.

Sarah shoWed me his
picture one time.

That's Weird.

I looked all over for
any picture of my dad

and I never found one.

NoW, don't go filling
her head With things

you can't prove.

What can't he prove?

<i>(Maxine)
The guy staying at
Arrow Lake is Mia's father.</i>

<i>(female)
You know, there is one
way to find out for sure.</i>

Get him to take
a paternity test.

That's the only Way
to knoW for sure.

You think he Would?

You see the car
this guy drives?

He's got some big
bucks and not likely

he's gonna Want to share
any of it With Mia.

All I knoW is he lost
the best thing that he ever

had When he left Sarah.

<i>(Travis)
You're right about that.</i>

Mia, you Want me to knock
some sense into his head,

you just let me knoW.

As you can see, I made
the changes you requested.

Rob, thanks for coming.

This is my assistant,
Rob Jackson.

Rob.

He's gonna be my eyes and ears
around the place While I'm aWay.

So you're going to
keep everyone on staff?

That's my intention.

We look forward to
expanding, not cutting back.

That's not exactly
What We expected to hear.

<i>Well, I guess we have
some paperwork to sign.</i>

Excellent.

So What do you plan to do noW
that you've sold your business?

<i>I'm going on vacation.</i>

<i>I'm gonna visit some of those
places I've been writing about.</i>

I haven't been on
vacation in 20 years.

Well, it's high
time you go, then.

Afternoon, Travis.

I understand you
Want to see me.

Yep.

So What's up?

You knoW that neW
guy from NeW York?

NeWspaper guy?

Yeah, that's the one.

Well, I think he's
the one that killed Sarah.

That's a mighty big
accusation, Travis.

You got anything
to back it up?

I hear he's got some
front end damage to his car.

You don't say.

Thanks.

Anytime.

ToWn is just not
the same Without Sarah.

Nope.

<i>(Daniel)
Hey.</i>

Hey.

It's almost tea
time, isn't it?

Yeah.

Everything's ready;
let me just get it for you.

Some homemade
scones and cream.

My favorite.

WoW.

Mom's recipe.

Mm, she must have
been a great cook.

I've had scones at the Ritz
that didn't taste this good.

Where is everybody?

Well, the honeymooners
Went home and

Ed's off to see his
customers in Oklahoma.

But We'll have a full
house again this Weekend.

Excellent.

I'm going to do some
Work out on the patio.

God knoWs I have plenty to do
noW that I bought the paper.

Does that mean you'll be
staying around for aWhile?

I'm not sure yet.

We'll have to see.

Hey Bobby.

What are you doing?

I'm Workin' on this car.

What's Wrong With it?

Needs a neW starter.

Had any cars come in
With some front end damage?

No sir.

HoW about any vehicles
shoWin' red paint skin off

another car?

No sir.

No sir.

You'd tell me if
you did, Wouldn't you?

Yes, sir.

Well, you give me a call
if you see anything like that,

okay?

Yes, sir.

We'll go over that When
We get back to the office.

Mia, I'd like you to meet
my neW assistant, Rob.

Rob's from out of toWn.

He's lookin' for
a place to stay,

so listen to What
I've Worked out.

Remember you've been telling
me it's hard to, you knoW,

go to school full-time
and run this place?

Yeah.

Well, Rob's your man.

He's going to be your
help around here, okay?

He's going to move in.

I'll pay his rent, so
don't Worry about that.

In exchange, he's going to do
Whatever you Want around here.

HoW's that sound?

Sounds great.

When does he start?

HoW about right noW?

Rob, haul this
to the kitchen.

Good man.

You see that?

Not much business
for a Saturday.

Everybody's
at the rodeo.

Yee-haW.

I knoW you think he left
mom high and dry,

but What if he lost his memory
When he Was missing in action?

Maybe that's Why
he never called.

I don't knoW.

<i>Look, he's the best thing
that's happened to me,</i>

<i>except for you and Mom.</i>

Where'd you get that?

I found it after Mom died.

It Was in an old cedar
box up in her closet.

What Was she doing
With this clipping?

You tell me.

My mother told me that my father
Was named Daniel Williams,

that he Was in the Gulf War,
that he Was declared

missing in action in 1990 and
she never heard from him again.

Is that clipping
talking about you?

Yes.

I Was MIA for three
and a half months,

but I never met your mother.

She Went to Evergreen College

and that's Where
she met Daniel Williams.

Look, is there any Way you
could have been injured,

forgot about her?

Listen, I knoW it must
have been hard not having

a father When you
Were groWing up.

<i>You just lost your mother.</i>

<i>But I was never injured.</i>

I never had amnesia.

I remember everything before,
during, and after my capture.

<i>As much as I wish it was
true, I'm not your father.</i>

From What I gather, your
mother's not the type of person

that a man Would forget.

NeW York City's a big place.

There's probably dozens
of Daniel Williams' there.

She probably
married one of them.

<i>(Mia)
And then he said Mom
must have married</i>

some other Daniel Williams.

Did you find any
records at city hall?

No.

Maybe We got
it all Wrong.

Maybe We got
it all Wrong.

But it all fits.

Hey, Where's the fire?

NoWhere.

I just got a lot on
my plate right noW.

Oh yeah, I heard
about your mom.

I'm sorry to hear
about the accident.

Thanks.

Seems to me like you could
use a little bit of fun

in your life right noW.

HoW about I pick
you up at 8:00?

Oh, I appreciate
the offer, but I can't.

Okay, Mom.

You Win.

Hey, Chuck, is that
offer still open?

Yeah, sure.

What time should
I be ready?

I live at the...

The ArroW Lake B&B,
I knoW.

I'll be there at 8:00.

Okay.

Bye.
Bye.

<i>(Chuck)
And then my little
brother walks in the room</i>

and I Was just done.

Will there be
anything else, sir?

Oh no, that's good.

Thank you, sir.

Oh, I did not
realize hoW late it Was.

We missed the start
of the last movie.

It's okay.

I have never met someone
Who's just so easy to talk to.

You Want to go
listen to some music?

I don't knoW.

I have a lot of people
coming in tomorroW,

so We should
probably get going.

Well, We can just
go for one dance, please.

Okay.

All right.

Here We are,
tWo gin and tonics.

Thanks.

You must come here a lot.

Mostly With my roommate.

Uh huh, your roommate
likes gin and tonics.

Yeah, Who doesn't?

I've never had one.

Really?

Then you are in
for a real treat.

You knoW, I read
those pages you gave me.

You got some talent.

HoW much have you Written?

About 100.

That's good.

I haven't had much time to
Write on it since Mom's died.

Well, you try to
Write a page a day

and it'll be done
before you knoW it.

I guess I could
do that much.

Well, I better
get to bed.

Thank you for the tea.

<i>Hey, are you sure
you never met my mom?</i>

Yeah.

I'm sure.

<i>You sleep well.</i>

Good night.

Night, Dad.

<i>(Bobby)
Just came in
this morning.</i>

Excellent.

HoW long Will it
take to fix it?

About an hour.

An hour.

Tell you What, Why don't
you make it 30 minutes?

Yes, sir.

Mr. Williams?

You already paid
for the part.

That's right,
that's for you.

I get right
on that, sir.

<i>(Maxine)
Think it's a good idea for
you to be staying at the B&B?</i>

I think it's a great idea.

It's close to the paper
and I like it there.

That's not
What I meant.

Haven't you
hurt her enough?

What are you
talking about?

Don't play dumb With me.

You knoW Who
I'm talking about.

Mia.

I Would never hurt Mia.

You left her mother to fend
for herself for all those years.

Not so much as a postcard to
let her knoW you Were okay.

Look, I'm going to
tell you one more time, okay.

I Want you to listen to this;

I'm not Mia's father.

Okay, I never met her mother.

You're looking at the
Wrong Daniel Williams.

That's What I thought
at first, but I've seen

the neWspaper clippings.

I couldn't have left her.

I never met Sarah.

I've been a bachelor
for the past 20 years.

You don't strike me
as the bachelor type.

Thank you.

I'll try that special.

Bring me an official
taster While you're at it.

Seems like everybody
in toWn hates me.

So?

Get a paternity test.

Where am I gonna
do that out here?

You can do it
on the Internet.

Just send in some of
your DNA, some of Mia's,

see if it's a match.

Well, it Won't be.

Then you'll have proof.

And all these meat-heads from
Mayberry Will leave you alone.

Sounds like
a pretty good idea.

I'll think about it.

<i>I hope Mia lets us
cook up these fish.</i>

Hope so too.

[doorbell ringing]

Can I help you, sheriff?

Need to speak
With you in private.

Do you mind?

Yes, sir.

Had a report that you
had some front end damage

to your car.

Is that true?

Yes, sir.
Is that a crime?

Depends.

I see it's been fixed.

Had Bobby take
care of it in toWn.

Kid does good Work.

I kneW that boy
Was lying.

Sorry, sir?

Never mind.

Where Were you When
Sarah Williams Was murdered?

Murdered?

I thought her death
Was an accident.

It Was, but Whoever
hit her left the scene of

the accident and is
responsible for her death.

Well, that Wasn't me, sir.

Can you prove it?

NoW sheriff, I
didn't kill anybody.

HoW'd you get that
front end damage?

I hit a deer just
outside of Arroyo Grande

the night I got in toWn.

Mind if I take
a closer look at your car?

That Was great.

Here, I'll get those.

Thank you.

So hoW's
the Writing coming?

Good.

I'm Writing a page a day.

That's my girl.

Hey, I thought you
Were going to help me.

Looks like I'm going to have

Wait, What about Mia?

Give her a call and see

<i>Hi, can I help you?</i>

I'm here to get a DNA test.

A paternity test?

Why do you say that?

Well, I don't think you're
here to prove you're some sort

of criminal.

Fair enough.

So hoW do We do this?

You'll give us a sample.

We'll get a sample
from the other party.

And then We'll see
if there's a match.

Okay, Well, I have a sample
of her DNA in a glass here.

That'll Work.

That's perfect.

NoW What you'll need to
do is take this form

Here you go.

Thank you very much.

Anything good in there?

<i>(Maxine)
Just the usual.</i>

Catalogues, preapproved
credit cards, ads.

<i>What brings you
here so early?</i>

I got a call from
the D.A. In San Marcos.

They're gonna press
charges against Chuck.

Good.

<i>She said she'd press them
even if I didn't testify,</i>

but she'd have a stronger
case if I did.

So you're gonna
testify, aren't you?

I don't knoW.

Maybe Daniel
just overreacted.

<i>Uh-uh.</i>

Mia, you got to
do What's right.

<i>Your mom would want you
to stand up for yourself.</i>

That must be her.

Wish me luck.

AIWays.

Hi, can I get
you something?

No, thank you...
is that Mia Williams?

Thank you.

<i>Rosemary,
Rosemary Landry.</i>

Nice to meet you,
Rosemary.

<i>You too.</i>

<i>I'm going to ask you
a couple of questions.</i>

<i>This guy, Chuck.</i>

Tell me What he did.

I'm not even sure if he
tried to rape me or not.

Let me be
the judge of that.

Okay.

Where do I start?

Start from the beginning.

HoW long have
you knoWn Chuck?

What you doing?

Oh, just some
bookkeeping.

Brought you some tea.

I am so sorry.

I completely forgot
What time it Was.

Don't be silly,
I knoW hoW to make tea.

I might sit out here
and keep you company.

Read my paper.

Got a minute?

I've got a class
in 10 minutes.

This Won't take long.

Okay.

I'm going to
need you to testify.

The other girl dropped out

and if you don't testify,

Chuck's going to get aWay With
this, just like his father did.

His father?

Yeah, it runs
in the family.

TWenty-some years ago, Chuck's
father raped me and I don't knoW

hoW many other girls in this
county, so this is personal.

Whatever happened
to his father?

Nothing.

Things Were
different back then.

No one Would
have believed us.

What Was his name?

Lonnie,
Lonnie Rogers.

I'll never forget it.

Good looking With
a rattler tattoo.

The big football hero.

Yep, that's the one.

Thought he Was God's
gift to the World.

Hell, I'm surprised there aren't
20 little Chucks running around.

I don't knoW.

I'm just noW starting to
get my life back to normal.

Can you live With the idea that
you might have done

something to prevent
this from happening

to another girl
and didn't?

Here's my card.

Call me.

Hey, Mia.

Hey.

What's this?

Your mail.

Thought I'd deliver it
since I Was coming by.

Thanks.

You gonna open that?

I'll Wait.

Hey ladies,
What's going on.

Hey, We're
going to a movie.

Want to come?

Oh, I'm going
to pass on that,

but you guys have
a good time.

Yes, is Rosemary Landry in?

This is Mia Williams.

<i>Would you please let her know
that I've decided to testify?</i>

<i>Yeah, she has my number.</i>

Okay, thanks.

<i>You heard?</i>

Yeah.

I Want you to knoW I'll be there
every step of the Way With you.

Thanks, Daniel.

You ain't got
nothin' on me.

Every one of those
girls Wanted it.

Like tWo peas in a pod.

What's that
supposed to mean?

It means you're the spitting
image of your slack-jaW father.

<i>But unlike your father, we've
got someone who will testify</i>

and she has a Witness.

<i>Hey sheriff, what
brings you here?</i>

Mr. Jones told me that he saW
a black blur hit Sarah's car,

<i>but I didn't find any evidence
on her car that she hit</i>

<i>anything but concrete barrier.</i>

<i>So I got to thinking,
what if he was right?</i>

That Would mean that
there'd be a car

With some red paint
on it someWhere.

Mm-hmm.

<i>I asked Bobby to give me
a call if he saw any car</i>

With any red paint on it.

<i>And he did.</i>

<i>Told me that Chuck's car
had some red paint on it.</i>

So I took a little
drive over to Chuck's.

He Weren't home,
but his pickup Was.

<i>Had it checked out.</i>

It Was a match.

<i>(Rosemary)
We got him
on manslaughter.</i>

<i>That's better than
attempted rape any day.</i>

You're going doWn for
a long time, Chuckie.

And you're gonna be real popular
'cause I hear the boys

love it When
the rapists arrive.

<i>Get him out of here.</i>

C'mon.

Hey.

Hey.

<i>I got here as soon as I
could... is everything okay?</i>

Everything is excellent.

I just Wanted to let you knoW
that I spoke to a good friend

of mine in NeW York City today
that happens to be a big agent.

And he Wants to read the
first 50 pages of your book.

Are you serious?

I'm very serious.

Come on, I Want to
take you to lunch.

Where do you Want to go?

Are you sure We're not
celebrating a little early?

Do you knoW hoW hard it
is to get an agent like this

to read your material?

Pretty hard, huh?

Where are We goin'?

I've got
the perfect place.

<i>(Daniel)
This place
smells unbelievable.</i>

Wait until you taste it.

You gonna have
some potato salad?

Yes, please.

Oh, look at that.

My Lord, What is that?

That is family style.

Trust me.

Family style is huge.

What do We got in here?

Meat, ribs.

I'm gonna get this
stuff all over me.

It'll look good on you.

So you have
any plans later?

Not really.

Hey, there's a really
good band playing over

at the Road House tonight.

Oh, yeah, the Road House.

That's one of my
favorite places.

Come on.

You Want to go to
the Road House tonight?

All right, it's a deal.

Okay.

Here, We got
a spot right there.

Perfect.

What'll it be?

TWo long necks, please.

Coming right up.

You didn't Want some?

TWo Long Necks.

<i>(Travis)
I done told you, I
ain't servin'you in here.</i>

Travis, have
you lost your mind?

Mia, this is
betWeen him and me.

I don't Want
his kind in here.

And What kind
might that be?

<i>The kind that would leave
a woman who is pregnant</i>

Without a dime When it's his
baby and never look back.

And then come prancing in here,
trying to make everything okay.

<i>Well, it ain't okay.</i>

<i>(Maxine)
Travis, you got
it all wrong.</i>

Oh, What's this?

He's got you under
his spell noW too?

No, not under any spell.

You better calm
yourself doWn.

Don't tell me to
calm doWn in my oWn bar.

<i>Are you gonna leave or am I
gonna drag you out of here?</i>

<i>'Cause you're not gonna pull
the wool over her eyes</i>

like you did her mother's.

<i>Now get out of here!</i>

Fine.

Get your purse
and let's go.

With her you're not.

Get your hands
off of my daughter.

What'd you say?

I said, "get your hands
off of my daughter."

I'm sorry.

I Was just afraid
to admit it.

Mr. Williams, guess
I oWe you an apology.

Apology accepted.

NoW ladies, let's go.

Travis, you okay?

Yeah, I guess so.

I'll alWays
miss her though.

Sarah?

Yeah.

I asked her to
marry me once.

She laughed and said
she Was already married.

Did not knoW that.

One hell of a Woman.

Some day,
she's gonna miss you

Some day,
she's gonna miss you

Is there a Miss Williams
in the house?

Hey Daniel.

I got something for you.

Better take a look.

Hurry up.

Open it!

They've accepted
my book proposal!

Thank you so much.

I can't believe it.

Well, you better
believe it.

You only have 200 more
pages to come up With.

I Wish Mom could
have seen this.

She can.

Sounds like a cause for
a celebration if you ask me.

We've got tWo
things to celebrate.

What's that?

Maxine and I have decided
to go into business together.

She's buying half of the B&B,
so I'll be able to go back

to university in the spring.

You don't have
to go back to Work.

I can put my only
daughter through college.

We've got a lot of
catching up to do.

I appreciate the offer,
but it meant a lot to Mom.

I Want to keep it open.

<i>(Daniel)
Then you should.</i>

Well heck, Welcome
to the B&B business.

Well heck, Welcome
to the B&B business.

What'll it be?

One Stars all around.

You got it.

I'm not going to
go to there.

It's not gonna happen.

Travis.

Thank you.

Welcome to Arroyo Grande.

Thank you very much.

You're Welcome.

Get on that floor.

Girl, you're not
getting me out there.

There's still something
I don't understand.

What's that?

I knoW you're
not Mia's father.

HoW do you knoW that?

I opened the lab report.

I knoW I shouldn't
have done it,

but I Was so afraid you
Were gonna hurt her.

I'll never tell.

HoW come you tWo have
the same last name?

I did a little
homeWork on that.

I guess Sarah Went to
a NeW York City district court

and had her name changed.

She must have loved Mia an
awful lot to go through

all that trouble.

We better keep it secret.

When are you going
back to NeW York?

I don't knoW.

I kind of like it here,
I may never go back.

Well, you keep that up,
I'm going to leave tonight.

Did you see that?

What the heck Was that?

Hit my ball doWn in the pool.

My gosh.

<i>I'm comin' after
that yellow ball, girl.</i>
