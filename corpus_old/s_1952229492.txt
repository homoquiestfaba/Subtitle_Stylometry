'MORNING PRINCIPAL ANDERSON.

WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, PERSONAL MAIL,

BUT I USED
MY OWN POSTAGE.

MMM. GOOD.
RIGHT.

MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

SURE.

YOUR POETRY COURSE,

IT'S NOT VERY POPULAR.

NEITHER IS POETRY, SIR.
MMM.

BUT THE FEW WHO TAKE IT,
THEY GET A LOT OUT OF IT.

YES YES,
I'M SURE THEY DO.

BUT I AM SORRY--
IF YOUR CLASS ENROLLMENT

DOESN'T IMPROVE BY NEXT SEMESTER,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DROP IT.

WE'RE ONLY BUDGETED FOR
ONE ENGLISH ELECTIVE,

AND MIKE LANE'S CREATIVE-WRITING
COURSE IS QUITE THE HIT.

I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS UP.

WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.

HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MR. L?

I'M A LUCKY GUY.

HOW DOES A LUMP LIKE ME

DON'T INSULT MY TASTE.
I'M THE LUCKY GUY.

YOU FINISHED?

YEAH. I WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST TO READ IT.

I'M HONORED.

REALLY?

MAYBE I'LL TAKE YOU
SOMEPLACE FANCY FOR DINNER.

HOW ABOUT YOU COME OVER TO MY
PLACE FOR SOMETHING HOT AND SPICY?

IS THAT A DOUBLE ENTENDRE?

NO, I WAS JUST GOING TO
MAKE YOU MY CHILI. - OH.

AND THEN BANG YOU.

GREAT!

YOU HAVE A VERY
PROFESSIONAL DAY, MISS REED.

WHAT IS IT?

EW, IS THAT WOMAN

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
IT'S FUCKING GERMAN SCHIZER PORN.

ALL RIGHT, DUDE?
IT'S FUCKING HOT, RIGHT, YO?

NO, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU, YO?

NOTHING.

YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF
YOU LIVED IN EUROPE.

I MEAN, THESE EUROPEANS ARE
MUCH MORE BROADMINDED THAN
THESE UPTIGHT AMERICANS.

SHIT'S HUGE IN GERMANY.

YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT IN EUROPE
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF.

YEAH, I KNOW,
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE A FAG.

DUDE, IT'S GROSS.

I'D DO IT...

DO SOMEONE.

OH.
I WOULD.

I'D CHILI-DOG HER.

HI, JENNIFER.

COME ON, BABY, THAT PUSSY'S
NOT GONNA EAT ITSELF.

WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

UH, NOTHING.

YOU'RE A FUCKING PIG.

WOW, OKAY.

HOLD THAT.

( grunts )

<i>( crowd reacting )</i>

I DON'T EVEN PLAY SPORTS.

YOU--

YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.

OH, YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME UP?

COME ON.
CAN'T YOU CONTROL THAT ANIMAL?

NOW COME ON, TOUGH GUY,
LET'S GO.

LET'S GO, GUYS.
COME ON.

Principal:
<i>KYLE,</i>

WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO JENNIFER?

NOTHING.

HE SAID THAT HER PUSSY
IS NOT GOING TO EAT ITSELF.

DO YOU HEAR THAT?

YOU ARE--
THAT IS RUDE.

AND YOU'RE A PERVERT.
BE QUIET.

KYLE, IS THAT
WHAT YOU SAID?

NO.

JENNIFER, CHRIS,
GET BACK TO CLASS.

<i>KYLE, I NEED TO SPEAK</i>
<i>WITH YOU AND YOUR FATHER.</i>

<i>KYLE,</i>

RIGHT NOW YOU'RE
ON ACADEMIC PROBATION

AND YOUR GRADES SHOW NO
SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT.

<i>IF YOU DON'T</i>
<i>STRAIGHTEN UP,</i>

I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
EXPEL YOU.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YES, MR. ANDERSON.

I DO UNDERSTAND.

NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
AND NO MORE TROUBLE.

WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.

LANCE,

THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME.

<i>WHAT ISN'T EASY,</i>
<i>MR. ANDERSON?</i>

HOW'S KYLE BEEN ACTING
AT HOME?

I MEAN, DOES HE SEEM
NORMAL TO YOU?

OH, YEAH.

OH.YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT SOMETIMES

THESE THINGS TAKE
A LONG TIME TO SURFACE.

WHAT THINGS?

WELL, I THINK THAT KYLE'S
POOR GRADES AND ACTING OUT

SHOW SIGNS OF A SERIOUS
DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM.

HE BELONGS IN
A SPECIAL-NEEDS SCHOOL

<i>WHERE HE CAN GET THE PROPER</i>
<i>ATTENTION AND CARE THAT HE REQUIRES.</i>

WHAT?
THAT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

SIR, HE'S--
HE'S NOT SLOW.

HE'S JUST BEING A PAIN.

<i>GIVE HIM</i>
<i>ANOTHER CHANCE.</i>

WELL, I HAVE.
I'VE GIVEN HIM MANY CHANCES.

THAT'S TRUE.

( sighs )

ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT, BUT HE'D BETTER START
SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT

AND QUICKLY. AND HE'S GOT TO STOP
DISTURBING THE OTHER STUDENTS.

THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.

YOU'RE GROUNDED.
I'LL RUN AWAY.

OH, AND LIVE
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

AND HER BOY-TOY TODD?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

I'LL TAKE AWAY YOUR COMPUTER.
NO, YOU WON'T.

YES, I WILL.
JESUS CHRIST, KYLE,

WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

I DIDN'T ASK TO
BE BORN.

NEITHER DID I.

BOO HOO.

Woman:
<i>YOU ARE SO FUNNY!</i>

WAIT, READ FROM HERE.

WHAT ARE YOU READING?
"WE DON'T EXPERIENCE IT

BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

BUT MAN, CAN HE
BE A HANDFUL.

HOW OLD IS HE?
TWO, GOING ON 20.

OH, GOD.

THE KID'S A PLAYER.

WELL, I WONDER WHERE
HE GETS THAT FROM.

I HAVE NO IDEA.
( laughs )

HOW'S HE DEALING WITH
THE SEPARATION?

REAL WELL.

I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SEPARATED.

YEAH.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH,

BUT HIS MOTHER AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO MAKE A BABY TOGETHER.

WE JUST WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

THAT'S SO SAD.
YEAH.

THANKS.

HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SEE HIM?

EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

THEY'RE NOT KIDDING WHEN
THEY SAY THAT RAISING A CHILD

I CAN'T SEND HIM HOME,
DAD!

GOD, MAN, YOU NEVER
LISTEN TO ME.

I TOLD YOU,
HE DOESN'T HAVE A FATHER

AND HE HAS A MOTHER
WHO'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

KYLE, SEND HIM HOME.
YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN SEND HIM HOME.

I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
TO THIS GUY.

OKAY? YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.

KYLE?
YOU'RE SO-- WHAT?

WHAT DO YOU WANT?
DO YOU WANT TO DO SOME HOMEWORK?

<i>I WOULD LOVE TO,</i>

KYLE, LET'S SEE

THAT'S A SINGLE ENTENDRE.

OH, I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU EARLIER.

I DIDN'T GET TO THE STORE
SO I DIDN'T MAKE CHILI.

OH.WELL, I'LL
TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER.

OH, I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

I MEAN, WE REALLY SHOULDN'T GO
OUT WHERE STUDENTS MIGHT SEE US.

WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL PICK UP
SOME TAKEOUT AND BRING IT OVER.

OH, WOULD YOU JUST HATE ME IF WE

I'M JUST NOT FEELING THAT GREAT,

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S

WE CAN GO TO A VIDEO STORE,
GET A MOVIE.

ARE YOU STUPID?
I HATE WATCHING MOVIES.

YOU USED TO LIKE WATCHING
MOVIES WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

YEAH, ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU WANTED ME TO.

MOVIES ARE FOR LOSERS
AND ART FAGS.

OH.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

UM...

CAN ANDREW AND I PLAY "DOOM"
ON MY COMPUTER?

YEAH.

JUST "DOOM,"
NOTHING ELSE.

I LIKE YOUR DAD.

MY DAD?

HE'S A FUCKING IDIOT.

YEAH, TOO FAST. YEAH.

I BELIEVE LIKE SIMON PEGG SAID,
"THE DEATH IS AN IMPEDIMENT,

NOT AN ENERGY DRINK."

<i>( laughing )</i>

<i>( funk music playing )</i>

WHAT YOU DOING?

JESUS, DAD.
YOU ALMOST MADE ME CRAP.

DID YOU GET YOUR
HOMEWORK DONE?

YEAH, A LONG TIME AGO.

YEAH.

YEAH.
<i>WHAT--</i>

<i>ARE YOU STONED?</i>

NO.

SERIOUSLY, YOU SMELL LIKE POT.
ARE YOU SMOKING POT?

NO.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

NO.
<i>YOU'RE NOT USING GRASS?</i>

NO, YOU DON'T USE GRASS.
NO.

<i>THEN WHAT'S--</i>
<i>WHAT'S THAT SMELL?</i>

WHAT SMELL?

IT'S PROBABLY A SKUNK OUTSIDE
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

OH YEAH, SURE,
A SKUNK.

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

WHY DON'T WE DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER TOMORROW?

WHY?
'CAUSE YOU FEEL BAD?

YEAH.NO.

I MEAN, IT'D BE JUST FUN TO DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

OKAY.
MMM.

YEAH.YEAH,
LIKE BUILD A ROCKET.

SURE, IF YOU WANT TO.

THAT'S RETARDED.

YEAH.

YEAH.

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
NOTHING.

OH, COME ON NOW, KYLE, YOU MUST
BE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING.

YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I LIKE?
YEAH.

I LIKE LOOKING AT VAGINAS...
AHH.

...ALL DAY LONG.

( laughs )

<i>THERE YOU GO.</i>
YEAH.

BUT MAYBE DO SOMETHING
NON-VAGINA RELATED.

YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE
THE VAGINA.

OKAY, UH,
WE COULD GO TO THE MALL.

OKAY. AND THEN
WE'LL CATCH A MOVIE.

YEAH, SURE,
AT THE MALL, YOU KNOW?

AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE
LOOK FOR A NEW COMPUTER.

NO NO,
WE'LL JUST HANG.

DAD, DID I TELL YOU THAT
WE HAD TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER?

NO, I SAID-- IF YOU
WERE LISTENING TO ME--

THAT WE COULD LOOK
FOR A NEW COMPUTER, OKAY?

AND THEN WE'LL GO
TO YOUR MOVIE.

OKAY. BUT WE'RE NOT
BUYING A NEW COMPUTER.

YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS FUN.

THIS ISN'T
THE BIGGEST SCREEN.

JESUS CHRIST,
HOW ABOUT A "THANK YOU"?

ARE YOU ON YOUR PERIOD
OR SOMETHING?

<i>CAN I NOT SAY ANYTHING?</i>

HEY, ISN'T THAT-- ISN'T THAT
MIKE WITH MISS REED?

YEAH, IT IS.

DUDE, I WOULDN'T LET
MY BITCH TREAT ME THAT WAY.

YOU DON'T HAVE A "BITCH."
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

HI, KYLE.
HEY.

MR. CLAYTON.
HELLO, ANDREW.

OH, WOW, SO HE
GOT IT FOR YOU.

SWEET. - NOT THAT SWEET.
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST ONE.

WHAT-- DAD, WE'RE GONNA
GO HOME AND HOOK THIS UP.

WHAT ABOUT GOING TO
THE MOVIES?

DAD, WE'LL GO
TO DINNER LATER!

OKAY, FINE.

UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, MR. CLAYTON?

OH, PROBABLY GO TO THE MOVIES
BY MYSELF, ANDREW.

ANDREW!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

<i>YOU'RE CARRYING THAT</i>
<i>THE REST OF THE WAY.</i>

WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

FUCKING PUSSY.

GOD DAMN IT.

<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

HELLO?
HEY, IT'S ME.

WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?

<i>I was with Mike.</i>
<i>He was having a breakdown about his divorce.</i>

HE WAS DEPRESSED 'CAUSE
HE HAD TO GO TO THIS WEDDING,

SO I WENT WITH HIM TO THE MALL AND
HELPED HIM PICK UP A SUIT TO WEAR.

I KNOW,
I SAW YOU TWO THERE.

YOU DID?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMED WEIRD.

DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I HAVE MALE FRIENDS?

NO, IT BOTHERS ME YOU KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET

AND YOU'RE OUT
IN PUBLIC WITH HIM.

OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT, HMM?

LET'S GO OUT.
WE'LL GO OUT SOMEPLACE FANCY,

SOMEPLACE THE WORLD
CAN SEE US.

HOW ABOUT
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE?

OH.

ANYONE WHO'S ANYBODY
WILL BE THERE.

YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE
AUSSIETIZERS...

YOU KNOW, WAIT, I CAN'T.
I PROMISED KYLE I'D TAKE HIM OUT.

LET ME TAKE
BOTH OF YOU OUT.

IT'LL BE MY TREAT.
<i>Really?</i>

OH.
THAT'S SO NICE.

HEY, KYLE.
<i>I'M IN HERE.</i>

WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TIP OVER THIS PHOTO?

<i>'CAUSE I HATE IT.</i>
<i>I LOOK INBRED.</i>

I THINK YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER
TONIGHT WITH CLAIRE.

WHAT? NO.

NO, WE'RE NOT.
OH, COME ON.

I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SEEING MR. LANE.

NO NO, THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS
AND SHE'S TRYING TO HELP HIM
OUT THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

WHY AM I EXPLAINING
THIS TO YOU, KYLE?

DAD, OKAY, LOOK,

IT'S BAD ENOUGH BEING SEEING
WITH A TEACHER AS A DAD,

BUT BEING SEEN WITH
TWO TEACHERS IS AIDS.

OKAY, GET DRESSED.
PUT ON SOMETHING NICE.

IF YOU DON'T ACT RIGHT AT DINNER,
I'LL STAB YOU IN THE FACE.

SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO, KYLE?

NOTHING.

NOTHING?
YOU MUST LIKE TO DO SOMETHING.

NO.

KYLE JUST GOT A NEW MONITOR
FOR HIS COMPUTER.

SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO ON THE COMPUTER?

OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY YOU ASK.

<i>I LIKE--</i>
GAMES, MOSTLY.

KYLE, WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?
ANDREW.

WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A BREAK
WHILE WE'RE EATING, SON?

NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

PUT IT AWAY.

( chuckles )

SO, KYLE,

DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS.

OKAY.
OOH.

WATCH OUT.

ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IT?

YEAH, ALL THE TIME.
NON-STOP.

I'M HURTING RIGHT NOW.

( laughs )

LET'S NOT MAKE ME
THROW UP.

SO DO YOU PLAY SPORTS?

NO NO. I'M A BIG SPAZ LIKE MY DAD.

WELL, I WAS ON THE DIVE TEAM
IN COLLEGE.

DIVING IS NOT REALLY
A SPORT, IT'S FALLING.

I'M SORRY.

<i>NO OFFENSE.</i>
<i>IT'S JUST FUNNY.</i>

HEY, WHY DON'T WE RENT
A MOVIE AFTER DINNER?

SURE, AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT HORROR.

REALLY?
I DO NOT LIKE HORROR.

ZOMBIES? ARE YOU
OKAY WITH ZOMBIES?

NO.
OH.

DO YOU LIKE MUSICALS?
I LOVE MUSICALS.

BOB FOSSE WAS A GREAT
DIRECTOR.

HE DID "SWEET CHARITY"
AND "ALL THAT JAZZ."

"CABARET." - ONE OF THE GREAT
NAZI MUSICALS OF ALL TIME.

BESIDES "THE SOUND
OF MUSIC," YOU KNOW?

THEN HE DID "STAR 80."
THAT WAS NOT A MUSICAL, BUT...

I ONLY LIKE THE MUSICALS.
OH, WELL.

ME TOO.
"WILLY WONKA."

WHICH ONE?

Lance: <i>WELL, GENE WILDER.</i>
( beeping )

I LIKE JOHNNY DEPP.
OH.

YEAH.
MM-HM.

BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE GENE WILDER... - <i>( beeps )</i>

...IN "YOUNG...
Both: FRANKENSTEIN."

<i>"WHAT HUMP?"</i>

DID YOU SEE IT?

NO.
OH, YOU SHOULD.

IT'S AMAZING.
REALLY WONDERFUL.

YEAH.
EVERYBODY'S SEEN IT.

I'M SURE.
<i>YEAH.</i>

NIGHT, MISS REED.
GOOD NIGHT, KYLE.

DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HIT THAT SHIT TONIGHT?

SHUT UP! - COME ON, DUDE.
THAT SHIT'S TIGHT, DUDE.

SERIOUSLY, IF YOU
DON'T NAIL HER--

HEY HEY,
IF YOU DON'T NAIL HER, DUDE, YOU'RE--

YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
WILL YOU STOP IT?

<i>DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T THINK</i>
<i>ABOUT PUSSY ALL THE TIME TOO.</i>

<i>I KNOW YOU DO.</i>
<i>KYLE.</i>

<i>YOU'RE DROPPING ME</i>
<i>OFF FIRST, I GET IT.</i>

<i>YOU WANT ME TO GO.</i> - I JUST WANNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT TO HER ALONE.

OKAY?
WITH YOUR COCK.

KYLE,
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.

WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT THE FUCK UP?

JESUS, MAN. YOU FUCKING NEED
TO GET LAID. GO OVER THERE.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

ALL RIGHT. DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO, OKAY?

SHORT OF KILLING HER,
THAT LEAVES ME A LOT OF ROOM.

HEY, BABY.

SEE YOU TOMORROW,
KYLE.

NIGHT, WHORE.

HEY.

THAT WAS FUN.
THE KISS?

MM-HMM.
I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING, COME ON.

NOT TONIGHT.
WOW.

ARE YOU SHOOTING
ME DOWN?

LISTEN, I'D LOVE TO STAY,
BUT I PROMISED KYLE I'D BE RIGHT BACK.

KYLE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

OH NO.
HE LIKES YOU A LOT.

NO.
MM-HMM.

HE TOLD ME THAT
WHEN I DROPPED HIM OFF.

HE DID?
YEAH.

HE SAID I WAS
A LUCKY GUY.

NO, I'M THE LUCKY GUY.

I GOTTA GO.

OH, COME ON.
HE'S ALMOST AN ADULT.

YEAH.
MM-HMM.

WHOA.

HOW ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE
HOME WITH THAT BONER, HUH?

I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A STICK-SHIFT
JOKE THERE SOMEWHERE

BUT I CAN'T FIND IT 'CAUSE ALL
THE BLOOD'S LEAVING MY BRAIN.

SLEEP WELL.
HEY.

OH, THAT'S SWEET.
MMM.

<i>I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.</i>
OH.BOO.

YOU'RE MEAN.
GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PEA.

GOOD NIGHT,
CREAM CHEESE.

YOU KNOW I--
OH!

HMM?
<i>DAMN YOU.</i>

YOU SURE?

I'M BACK.

KYLE.

HEY, KYLE.

OH, KYLE.
I TOLD YOU TO STOP DOING THAT.

KYLE?

NO, I'M OKAY.
THANKS.

GINGER.

HEY, MIKE.

IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU BACK, LANCELOT.

THANKS.

MR. CLAYTON.

ANDREW.

HOW ARE YOU DOING?

OKAY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

THANKS.

AND I'M SORRY
ABOUT MY MOM.

WHY?
'CAUSE SHE THREW UP IN YOUR PLANTER

AT THAT THING AT YOUR
HOUSE AFTER THE FUNERAL.

I WONDERED
WHO DID THAT.

SHE DRINKS TOO MUCH.

I KNOW.

DON'T WORRY, ANDREW.

IT MEANT A LOT TO ME
THAT YOU CAME.

THANKS, MR. CLAYTON.
MR. CLAYTON.

SOMETHING DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME.

WHAT, ANDREW?

DID KYLE SEEMED
THAT BUMMED OUT TO YOU?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

TO DO WHAT HE DID.
HE JUST--

IT'S JUST, HE DIDN'T
SEEM THAT SAD.

ANDREW, KYLE WAS
A COMPLEX GUY.

YEAH,
I'LL SAY.

HEY.

HEY.

HOW ARE YOU?

I'M OKAY.

GOOD.

I WANT TO APOLOGIZE THAT I HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE MORE FOR YOU.

IT'S JUST THAT
I DON'T DO DEATH WELL.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW, I--

I'VE BEEN KIND OF A ZOMBIE
LATELY ANYWAY.

I'M REALLY SORRY.

PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

I'M NOT.

LET'S DO SOMETHING SOON,
ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT.

CHEER UP, PUMPKIN.

I LIKE YOU.

THANKS.

<i>( door closes )</i>

Anderson: <i>HARDLY ANYONE
CAMETO THE FUNERAL.</i>

I FELT BAD.
I SHOULD HAVE GONE.

DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
IT WAS A WEEKDAY.

<i>( door opens )</i>

LANCE,

<i>THIS IS MR. PENTOLA.</i>

MR. PENTOLA.
DR. PENTOLA.

<i>OH, DOCTOR.</i>

NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. CLAYTON.
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

THANK YOU.

DR. PENTOLA
IS A THERAPIST.

WE CALLED HIM IN
BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID

KYLE'S DEATH MAY
TRIGGER OTHER SUICIDES.

HE'S A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

OH.

<i>BEFORE WE BEGIN,</i>

I'VE READ A LOT OF
SUICIDE NOTES,

AND THIS ONE SEEMED...

<i>DEEP.</i>

REALLY?

<i>I NEED TO ASK YOU</i>
<i>A QUESTION.</i>

AND I WANT YOU TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

OF COURSE.

DID KYLE HAVE ANY FRIENDS?

EXCUSE ME?

WELL, IT'S JUST
NO ONE'S COME TO SEE ME.

YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW KYLE.

WELL, I SHOULDN'T SAY
NO ONE.

A COUPLE OF KIDS CAME IN WITH
AGE- APPROPRIATE DEPRESSION,

EATING DISORDERS.

ONE KID CAME IN
WITH HEAD LICE.

I KNOW HIM.

NOT REALLY MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

BUT NO ONE'S COME TO TALK
ABOUT KYLE.

HMM.

OH.
WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS?

ANDREW TROUTMEN.
AND WHO ELSE?

THAT'S IT.

KYLE WAS KIND
OF A LONER.

A LONE WOLF.

UH, I'LL HAVE TO
ASK ANDREW

TO COME AND SEE ME.

AND, LANCE, THAT GOES
FOR YOU TOO.

IF YOU NEED TO TALK, IF YOU WANNA
GET ANYTHING OFF YOUR CHEST,

<i>PLEASE, JUST COME</i>
<i>AND SEE ME.</i>

OF COURSE, DOC,
I WILL.

THANK YOU, LANCE.

<i>YOU'RE WELCOME,</i>
<i>MR. ANDERSON.</i>

ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WHO WANTS TO READ NEXT?

RIGHT HERE!
ALL RIGHT.

WHO'S GONNA
GIVE ME $20?

All: OH.
OH, COME ON NOW.

<i>( laughing )</i>
Mike: <i>ALL RIGHT. OKAY.</i>

JASON.

GO AHEAD.

"NEGRO?

I MAY BE YOUNG
BUT I'M NOT YOUR BOY

<i>I WON'T PICK YOUR COTTON</i>
<i>OR PICK UP YOUR DISHES</i>

YEAH, I SING,
I DANCE

BUT I DO IT WITH THE DIGNITY
OF MY ANCESTORS

I AM NOT YOUR MONKEY"

RIGHT ON.

STAY BLACK, Y'ALL.

ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE THEIR HAIKU?

( sobbing )

( beeps )

<i>( ringing )</i>

Claire: <i>Hello?</i>
HEY, SWEET TARTS.

<i>Hey.</i>
HOW ARE YOU?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M WATCHING MIKE PLAY BASKETBALL.

OH.

YOU OKAY?
OH, YEAH.

<i>You sure?</i>
OH, YEAH.

<i>( gasps ) OH MY GOD!</i>
WHAT?

I GOTTA GO.
MIKE JUST WON THE BASKETBALL GAME.

<i>( cheering )</i>

YEAH, MIKE!

<i>HI.</i>
HI.

I MADE YOU SOMETHING.

WHAT?

THOSE BROWNIES.
OH.

OH.
YEAH.

WELL, I'LL COME OVER
AND HAVE SOME.

I WAS THINKING MAYBE I COULD COME
IN AND WE'D EAT THEM TOGETHER.

NO, I CAN'T.

WHY NOT?
I'M BUSY.

BONNIE, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
IN MY APARTMENT.

MY APARTMENT IS A LITTLE
SAD RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

IF I-- IF I LET YOU IN,
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

<i>OKAY.</i>
OKAY.

SO...

BROWNIES, HUH?
YEAH.

COME IN.
AH.

PLEASE, DON'T TELL
ANYBODY, OKAY?

BECAUSE I-- I DON'T WANNA
GET THROWN OUT OF HERE.

OH, I PROMISE.
THANKS.

I-I KNOW
IT'S A FIRE HAZARD

AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
RATIONAL, BUT...

I FEEL THAT IF I
THROW ANYTHING OUT,

SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WILL HAPPEN.

NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
GOOD.

WHAT'S WRONG, SWEETIE?

I KNOW MY SON WAS
A JERK, BUT I MISS HIM.

HEY.

OF COURSE YOU DO.
MMM.

IT'LL GET BETTER.

IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT
RIGHT NOW.

DO YOU KNOW THAT

I HAVE READ EVERY ONE
OF YOUR BOOKS?

HOW?

HOW?

YOU THREW 'EM OUT.

OH, YEAH.

YOU ARE VERY TALENTED.

REALLY?

HONEST.
YOU HAVE A GIFT.

AND YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

I WON'T.

LISTEN,

THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A ZOMBIE
MARATHON ON TELEVISION

AND I CORDIALLY

INVITE YOU, SIR.

OH, WELL, BLESS YOU,
MADAM.

UH-HUH.
IT'S A DATE.

GOOD.

DON'T FORGET THE BROWNIES.

I WON'T FORGET.
NO.

YOUR DOG'S STARING
AT ME.

WHAT DOG?

( laughs )

I GOT YA.

LANCE!
OH.

I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
WHAT'S UP?

YOU KNOW THAT WHILE WE
RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY,

WE ALSO RESPECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND EXPRESSION HERE AT SCHOOL?

YEAH.
WELL, ONE OF THE KIDS ON THE PAPER

WENT ONLINE AND THEY FOUND
KYLE'S POLICE REPORT--

THE REPORT OF HIS DEATH.
AND NOW THEY'VE GONE AND
PUBLISHED HIS SUICIDE NOTE.

OH MY GOD.
YEAH.I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
IT'S ALL OVER CAMPUS.

REALLY?
YEAH.

YOU-- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

SURE.

I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, LANCE.

IT'S THAT GODDAMN
FIRST AMENDMENT, HUH?

YEAH.

Lance's voice:

HAS ANYONE SEEN
CARL OR STEVEN?

MM-HMM.

OH, YOU HAVE?
SO THEY'RE IN SCHOOL?

YEAH, I SAW 'EM
THIS MORNING.

FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE,

<i>ESPECIALLY THE NEWCOMERS.</i>

IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
WITH WRITING POETRY?

YES, HEATHER.
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

SURE.

WHAT WAS KYLE'S
FAVORITE BAND?

UH...

HE LIKED
BRUCE HORNSBY.

<i>YES, RAY?</i>

DID HE LISTEN
TO ANY METAL?

A LITTLE OZZY.
I KNEW IT.

ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT POETRY OR...

<i>YES, JASON?</i>

DID THE BOY KNOW JESUS
BEFORE HE WENT?

WELL, I WOULD SAY
HE WAS AN AGNOSTIC.

BUT I THINK HE WAS
SPIRITUAL IN HIS OWN WAY.

YEAH-- YES, HEATHER?

WHAT'S HIS SIGN?

OH, HE WAS BORN
APRIL 18TH, SO--

ARIES.

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

YOU KNOW, ANYBODY KNOW
EZRA POUND?

<i>LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI?</i>

YOU KNOW
WHAT KYLE REALLY LIKED?

EMILY DICKINSON.

WHAT BAND IS THAT?

IT WASN'T A BAND.
SHE WAS A POET.

SHE HOT?
<i>UM, SHE WAS A VICTORIAN.</i>

IF YOU LIKE YOUR BUTTONED-DOWN GIRL,
SHE WAS ONE OF 'EM.

NICE.
<i>( bell ringing )</i>

<i>MR. CLAYTON.</i>
<i>PETER.</i>

CAN I TALK TO YOU?
<i>SURE.</i>

IT'S ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE.

IT-- IT AFFECTED ME
A LOT.

WELL, IT SEEMED TO AFFECT
A LOT OF STUDENTS.

I'M NOT HAPPY, MR. CLAYTON. - MM-HMM.

I'M LIVING A LIE.
I'M GAY.

AND KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE,

IT'S HELPED ME GET THE
COURAGE TO COME OUT FINALLY.

WELL, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

I'M MISUNDERSTOOD TOO,
JUST LIKE HE WAS.

I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY.

GOOD FOR YOU, PETER.
I-I WISH YOU THE BEST.

THANK YOU.

HEY, MR. CLAYTON.

MR. CLAYTON.
GINGER.

KYLE WAS RIGHT.
EMILY DICKINSON'S GREAT.

ISN'T SHE?

MR. CLAYTON?
YES.

I WROTE ANOTHER POEM.
CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT, HEATHER.

JOHN.DOCTOR.
HEY.

CLAIRE.

MR. C., WHAT'S UP?

"MILKY WHITE SKIN
AND HAIR SO BROWN

I WISH I HAD KNOWN
HOW BAD YOU HURT

I COULD HAVE HELD YOU
WHILE YOU CRIED

YOU WERE TOO SWEET
TO STAY

IN THIS HARSH WORLD

BUT I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU CLOSE TO MY HEART

MY ANGEL IN CARGO PANTS"
Boy: <i>OH, WOW.</i>

<i>( applauding )</i>

HE WAS SUCH
A SWEET KID.

AND KIND.

OH, PLEASE.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

( sighs )
AS A FATHER,

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF
HUNTER DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

MY HEART REALLY GOES
OUT TO YOU, LANCE.

THANKS.

IT'S SO SAD. I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS SUCH A GOOD WRITER.

<i>DID HE WRITE</i>
<i>ANYTHING ELSE?</i>

YEAH, HE DID.

I KNOW IT'S REALLY PERSONAL,
BUT DO YOU THINK I COULD READ IT?

WELL, IF YOU CAME OVER
TO MY APARTMENT.

I JUST DON'T WANT HIS STUFF OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW, FLOATING AROUND.

SURE.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

GREAT.

MY PLAYOFF GAME'S
TONIGHT.

ALL RIGHT.
NOT THE LIP.

YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TAKE THE LIP.

OH, THANKS, MIKE.

WHAT TIME?

I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE TIME BECAUSE
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T CLEANED.

YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

WELL, 8:00?
THAT'S GREAT.

GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.

THANKS.

IF YOU THINK THIS
IS A BAD IDEA--

NO NO NO.
NOT AT ALL.

I FOUND SOMETHING
KYLE WROTE

AND I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.

OKAY.

THIS IS FROM HIS JOURNAL.

"I WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH
MY DAD AND CLAIRE TONIGHT.

I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM,

BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SEEING THEM TOGETHER

ONLY PROVES THAT I'LL
NEVER BE HAPPY.

I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND
A WOMAN LIKE HER--

<i>SO PRETTY,</i>
<i>SO PERFECT.</i>

SHE SEEMS TO COMPLETE HIM.

I HOPE THEY MAKE IT.

I HOPE THEY LAST.

I HOPE I'M LEAVING
MY DAD IN GOOD HANDS.

NO ONE COULD EVER GET ME.

I DON'T EVEN GET ME."

OH.

I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
COULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

HE DID LIKE ME.
HE REALLY DID.

<i>HE DID.</i>
<i>HE REALLY DID.</i>

I THOUGHT YOU WERE LYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

NO.
I'D NEVER DO THAT.

<i>REALLY?</i>
REALLY.

( moaning )

MR. CLAYTON.

GOOD MORNING, HEATHER.
YES.

GOOD MORNING.

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
OF KYLE'S?

WHAT?

THAT I COULD HAVE?

NO.
OH.

WAIT A SECOND.

HERE YOU GO.

BRUCE HORNSBY?

THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE.

THANK YOU.

I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

YEAH, I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT TOO.

YEAH.
( sighs )

I'M TIRED OF HIDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

MMM.

DAN.
LANCE.

GINGER.
MR. CLAYTON, LOOK AT THIS.

OH.

HEATHER.

HEY, MR. C.

OH, PETER.

DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.
OH.

I DON'T KNOW IF KYLE
EVER TOLD YOU,

BUT HE AND I WERE
KINDA BROS.

I'M GONNA WIN THIS GAME
TONIGHT IN HIS HONOR.

GREAT, PETER.

Andrew:
<i>MR. CLAYTON?</i>

ANDREW.

IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,
DOES IT?

WHAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT?

HOW EVERYONE IS ACTING.

<i>LIKE THEY LIKED KYLE.</i>

NO, IT DOESN'T.

<i>YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>IS WEIRD?</i>

WHAT?
KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE.

IN WHAT WAY?

THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING
AN INSIGNIFICANT MOLECULE

BOUNCING AROUND IN A
MEANINGLESS GODLESS UNIVERSE.

DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
BUT KYLE WAS...

WHAT?

KINDA DUMB.

HA.NO.

KYLE WAS ACTUALLY
SMART, ANDREW.

YOU KNOW, HE JUST PRETENDED
TO BE DUMB, EVEN AROUND YOU

SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WOULDN'T PICK ON HIM.

YEAH, MAYBE.

Heather: <i>IT'S MINE!</i>
Ginger: <i>LET GO, YOU CRAZY--</i>

HEY!

OH! GET OFF!

YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LIKE KYLE!

YOU DIDN'T LIKE KYLE!

SHUT UP, WHORE!

BRUCE HORNSBY?

Lance:
<i>I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.</i>

THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

I FEEL TERRIBLE.

SUICIDE LEAVES
MANY VICTIMS.

DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

KYLE MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING
FROM A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.

AND I KNOW THAT THE NOTE
BEING PUBLISHED

HAS CAUSED YOU SOME
DISTRESS,

BUT IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN
A VERY POSITIVE THING.

<i>STUDENTS ARE</i>
<i>COMING TO SEE ME.</i>

<i>IT'S THE BREAKTHROUGH</i>
<i>I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.</i>

WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OF THESE KIDS

I CAN HELP BECAUSE THEY'RE
REACHING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME?

YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE PART WHERE KYLE WRITES:

"I LOVE YOU, DAD."

BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T
REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?

BUT HE DID.

LANCE, SUICIDE

IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

AND WHO KNOWS

HOW MANY KIDS WE WON'T LOSE
BECAUSE OF THAT NOTE?

<i>KEEP YOUR CHIN UP KNOWING</i>

<i>THAT KYLE MAY HAVE NOT</i>
<i>DIED IN VAIN.</i>

<i>* IN LIGHT OF ALL</i>
<i>I'VE LEARNED SO FAR *</i>

<i>* I DON'T BELIEVE</i>
<i>I'M SO STRANGE *</i>

<i>* IN SPITE OF ALL</i>
<i>THIS TIME I SPEND *</i>

<i>* CALLING THE AIR</i>
<i>BY A NAME *</i>

<i>* WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT</i>
<i>GOES OVER THE TREES *</i>

<i>* HE WILL BE</i>
<i>SINGING WITH ME *</i>

<i>* AND IF I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>SINGING ALONE *</i>

<i>* HE ALWAYS</i>
<i>LEAVES ME BE *</i>

<i>* I'M SHAKING</i>
<i>MY SHADOW HAND *</i>

<i>* AS THE SUN MOVES</i>
<i>ROUND THE BEND *</i>

<i>* WITH AN IMAGINARY MAN</i>

<i>* AND WE'LL MAKE-BELIEVE</i>
<i>AROUND AND AROUND AGAIN *</i>

<i>* I'M SHAKING</i>
<i>MY SHADOW HAND... *</i>

Lance:
<i>DR. PENTOLA.</i>

LANCE, YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD.

WELL, I HAD KIND OF
A ROUGH WEEKEND.

I DID A LOT OF SOUL
SEARCHING

AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE

AND THE EFFECT
ON THE OTHER KIDS,

AND...

THIS IS KYLE'S JOURNAL.

I BROUGHT IT TO YOU
TO READ.

I WANT YOU TO READ IT, AND IF YOU THINK
IT'LL BE OF VALUE TO THE OTHER KIDS,

I WANNA PUBLISH IT
AND HAND IT OUT TO THEM.

I'LL SEE IF I CAN'T GIVE IT A LOOK.
OH, THANKS.

Lance:
WELL?

( sighs )

IT'S SO SAD.

YEAH.

I MEAN, KYLE WAS SUCH

A STRONG POWERFUL WRITER.

SO TORTURED.

YES, HE WAS.

WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA CALL IT?

I WAS THINKING
"I AM WHAT I HATE."

WHAT?

"I AM WHAT I HATE."
KYLE WROTE THAT IN CHAPTER SIX.

OH.

REALLY?
YEAH.

I DON'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.

WHY?

TO ME, A BETTER TITLE...
MM-HMM.

...WOULD BE
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

OH.
YOU KNOW?

BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

BUT HE DIDN'T WRITE
THAT THOUGH, I MEAN...

YEAH, BUT
HE FELT THAT.

YOU'RE INFERRING THAT FROM HIM.
<i>YES.</i>

OH.

"I AM WHAT I HATE" DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE AS A TITLE.

GIVE ME A KISS.
AW.

COME HERE.
OH.

<i>* EVERYBODY WANTS</i>
<i>TO BE A GENIUS *</i>

<i>* YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE *</i>

<i>* WITH ALL THINGS THAT</i>
<i>YOU MIGHT DO *</i>

<i>* WHICH ONE OF THEM</i>
<i>WILL YOU GET TO? *</i>

<i>* TOMORROW WHEN</i>
<i>YOU WAKE UP *</i>

<i>* THEN YOU'LL SHOW THEM *</i>

<i>* NOBODY WANTS</i>
<i>TO BREAK YOUR HEART *</i>

<i>* YOU DO IT ON YOUR OWN</i>

<i>* THERE'S NOTHING WRONG</i>
<i>WITH YOU TODAY *</i>

<i>* NOTHING YOU HAD</i>
<i>THAT THEY TOOK AWAY *</i>

<i>* BUT ALL THE TIME</i>
<i>YOU'VE WAITED FOR *</i>

<i>* WHAT IS OWED TO YOU</i>

<i>* YOU WANNA FIGHT,</i>
<i>THEY WILL FIGHT YOU BLUE *</i>

<i>* YOU WANNA LIE,</i>
<i>WHO WILL LIE WITH YOU? *</i>

<i>* YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE</i>
<i>WAITING FOR A SIGN *</i>

<i>* SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE *</i>

<i>* SO YOU'RE</i>
<i>THE ONLY ONE *</i>

<i>* EVERYONE'S HAD</i>
<i>SOME SITUATION *</i>

<i>* KEEP IT TO YOURSELF</i>

<i>* THERE'S NO NEED TO ANSWER</i>
<i>QUESTIONS *</i>

<i>* YOUR LIES HAVE SPOILED</i>
<i>TWO CONFESSIONS *</i>

<i>* AND ALL THE TIME</i>
<i>YOU'VE WAITED *</i>

<i>* WON'T COME BACK TO YOU *</i>

<i>* YOU WANNA FIGHT,</i>
<i>THEY WILL FIGHT YOU BLUE *</i>

<i>* YOU WANNA LIE,</i>
<i>WHO WILL LIE WITH YOU? *</i>

<i>* YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE</i>
<i>WAITING FOR A SIGN... *</i>

( inaudible )

<i>* SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE *</i>

<i>* SO YOU'RE</i>
<i>THE ONLY ONE *</i>

<i>* EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE</i>
<i>A GENIUS. *</i>

( moaning )

EVERYBODY LOVES THE BOOK.

YES, THEY DO.

YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
YEAH.YEAH.

FUCK ME.

I AM.
HARDER.

NO NO NO.
FROM BEHIND.

OKAY.OKAY.

LIKE THAT?
<i>YEAH.</i>

<i>OKAY.</i>
TO THE LEFT.

TO THE LEFT.
MY LEFT.MY LEFT.

OKAY.
YEAH!

YEAH.
DON'T STOP.

DON'T STOP.
DON'T STOP!

STOP! STOP.STOP.
<i>OKAY. SORRY.</i>

<i>PULL MY HAIR.</i>
<i>LIKE THAT?</i>

<i>NOT-- NOT SO HARD.</i>
<i>OH, OKAY.</i>

ARE YOU READY FOR
OUR UNDEAD MARATHON?

Lance: <i>Well, that's the thing.</i>
<i>Something came up.</i>

<i>KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.</i>
<i>I CAN'T MAKE IT.</i>

<i>Sorry.</i>
OH.NO, IT'S OKAY.

<i>CAN I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?</i>
OH YEAH, DEAR.GOOD.

YEAH, LISTEN I--
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>It's just a small emergency.</i>

OKAY.SEE YOU.
SORRY.BYE.

Mike: <i>EVERYTHING OKAYTHERE, PAL?</i>

YEAH, GREAT.

HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

YOU KNOW WHAT LINE
REALLY BLEW ME AWAY,

IS WHEN KYLE WROTE:

"AMERICA IS ONE OF THE FINEST
COUNTRIES ANYONE EVER STOLE."

THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

HE REMINDS ME
OF MY HUNTER.

LANCE, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

I LURED YOU OUT HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
IF WE RENAMED THE LIBRARY

THE KYLE CLAYTON
MEMORIAL LIBRARY?

BUT YOU WERE GONNA PUT HIM
IN A SPECIAL-NEEDS CLASS.

YEAH.

YEAH, AND I FEEL
REALLY BAD ABOUT THAT.

OH.
HE WASN'T SLOW.

OBVIOUSLY
HE WAS BRILLIANT.

HE WAS JUST BORED.

YOU KNOW, WE HAD HIM
TOTALLY WRONG.

I JUST HOPE TO GOD THAT OUR MISTAKE
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH--

WELL, WITH
WHAT HAPPENED.

I'M PRETTY SURE
IT DIDN'T.

THANKS, LANCE.

<i>YOUR SAYING THAT</i>
<i>MEANS A LOT.</i>

<i>THIS TRIBUTE WILL BE AN</i>
<i>INSPIRATION TO OTHER STUDENTS</i>

<i>AND IT'LL HELP KEEP</i>
<i>KYLE'S MEMORY ALIVE.</i>

SURE, SIR.
WYATT.

THANKS, LANCE.
THANKS.

OH!

JUST LIKE MY PROM NIGHT,
NOTHING WENT IN THE HOLE.

NO, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE A TASTEFUL DEDICATION.

VERY TASTEFUL.

<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>
<i>( beeps )</i>

HELLO?

YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WOW.
WHAT?

PENTOLA-- HE SENT
KYLE'S JOURNAL TO DR. DANA.

SHE LOVES IT. SHE WANTS ME
TO BE ON THE SHOW.

SHE'S GONNA FLY ME
TO L.A.

WHAT'S DR. DANA?
SHE'S LIKE OPRAH.

WELL, SHE'S NOT
AS BIG AS OPRAH.

I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD SHOW,
YOU KNOW?

WOMEN SEEM TO
REALLY LIKE IT.

<i>( knocking on door )</i>

ANDREW.
<i>ARE YOU BUSY, MR. CLAYTON?</i>

OH, NO NO.
JUST PACKING FOR MY TRIP.

YEAH, THAT TV SHOW.

"DR. DANA."

WHAT'S UP?

I FEEL BAD.

I WISH I KNEW
HE WAS THAT DEPRESSED.

YOU AND ME BOTH.

YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE
ABOUT THE BOOK?

WHAT?

KYLE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT VAGINAS, ANAL SEX,

FISTING, FELCHING
OR RIM JOBS.

IT IS A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE
FELCHING AREA, YOU'RE RIGHT.

BUT I THINK IT'S THERE,
ANDREW, IN ITS OWN WAY.

I WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
THE BOOK IS SO SMART AND SAD.

HE NEVER TALKED
WITH ME LIKE THAT.

<i>I WISH HE DID. MAYBE HE WOULDN'T</i>
<i>HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID.</i>

DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,
ANDREW.

ONE THING I KNOW,
HE LIKED YOU.

THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
TALK TO ME?

<i>WHAT DO YOU WANT ME</i>
<i>TO TELL YOU, ANDREW?</i>

MAYBE IT'S LIKE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

HE WAS SUPER SMART.
HE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
OF BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY.

BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE WAS ALREADY TREATED LIKE A FREAK.

IF HE WAS THAT SMART HE WOULD
HAVE LOVED TO RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT.

OH, JESUS CHRIST, ANDREW.
WHY CAN'T YOU LET IT GO, OKAY?

NO WONDER
YOUR MOTHER DRINKS.

YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LAST
THINGS KYLE SAID TO ME?

HE SAID THAT YOU'RE
A STUPID FUCKING IDIOT.

<i>HAVE A GOOD TIME</i>
<i>ON YOUR TV SHOW.</i>

KYLE'S STILL DEAD.

ANDREW.

ARE YOU ALMOST READY?
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.

Claire: <i>I THINK YOU SHOULD
KEEPYOUR PANTS ON.</i>

I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR PANTS ON.

<i>I'M NOT GOING</i>
<i>TO WEAR PANTS.</i>

OH.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

<i>YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.</i>

MMM.
THANKS.

I'M USING BACKWARD
PSYCHOLOGY.

IT'S NOT WORKING.
I HAVE TO PEE AGAIN.

<i>( knocking on door )</i>

HELLO.
MR. CLAYTON,

I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE
BUT THE SHOW CALLED AGAIN

AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE LEAVING.
OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BABY, THAT WAS THE DRIVER.
HE SAID THE SHOW CALLED.

WE GOTTA GET GOING,
OKAY?

( sighs ) - OH, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
LET'S GET GOING, COME ON.

DOES THIS MAKE MY ASS LOOK BIG?
NO NO. NOT AT ALL.

YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR ASS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I MEAN--
SO YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T HAVE AN ASS?

I'M SAYING YOUR ASS IS THERE,
BUT IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.

I'M CHANGING AGAIN.
NO.

YOU KNOW,
SWEETHEART,

I REALLY SHOULD GET OVER THERE SO
I COULD SIT DOWN WITH THE PRODUCER

AND GO OVER WITH WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY.

THAT WOULD
REALLY HELP ME A LOT.

ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
FABULOUS.

I REALLY--
NOPE.

I LIKE THAT DRESS.

SOMETIMES PEOPLE ON THE WAY,
THEY THROW UP IN MY CAR.

YEAH?
YEAH.

OKAY, LET'S GO.

YOU LOOK PRETTY.
THANK YOU.YOU'RE SO SWEET.

THANKS.
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS ON THE SHOW?

I AM.
OH.

NO, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
THANKS.

HI, LANCE CLAYTON

CLAIRE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING THE
PHOTOS OF KYLE. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

AND ALSO THE BOOK.

UP THE BACK OF THE BOOK?

THAT'S A DIRECTOR QUESTION.
I'M A SEGMENT PRODUCER.

HOW DO WE KNOW
WHEN THE CAMERA IS ON ME?

YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE
FRIENDS- AND-FAMILY SECTION.

<i>( audience applauding )</i>
COULD YOU GRAB A SEAT?

OKAY, YEAH.
SURE.

I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF
ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH LANCE.

LANCE, DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
NO NO.

LOOK OVER HERE, PLEASE.
GOOD.GOOD.

SO, LANCE, IF YOU SHOULD START
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SON...

MM-HMM.
...AND BEGIN TO CRY...

YEAH.
...OR WELL UP...

OKAY. - ...JUST GO WITH IT.
DON'T BE ASHAMED, OKAY?

YEAH.
AND IF YOU CRY...

MM-HMM.
...LOOK UP.

NO, LOOK DOWN, PLEASE.
OH.

DON'T LOOK DOWN.LOOK UP.
CAN YOU LOOK DOWN?

DON'T TUCK YOUR CHIN.
OH.

AND ABOVE ALL,
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

LANCE, HI.

LOOK THIS WAY, PLEASE.
I DON'T MEAN TO BUG YOU RIGHT NOW.

MY NAME IS BERT GREEN.
I'M WITH WITH McKENNA ARTIST.

HI, BERT.
YOUR SON'S MEMOIR IS SO STRONG.

MY GOD, IT'S SO MOVING.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU.

MM-HMM.

OH, THANK YOU. - HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO PUBLISHERS?

NO. - BECAUSE I HONESTLY
THINK THIS COULD BE

THE BIGGEST POSTHUMOUS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY

SINCE "THE DIARY
OF ANNE FRANK," HONESTLY.

REALLY?
OH MY GOD.

YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR...

YES.
YEAH, THAT'S HUGE.

LOOK, I'M GONNA GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR RIGHT NOW.

BUT IF ANY OF THIS
INTERESTS YOU,

GIVE ME A CALL, OKAY?
OKAY.

JUST GIVE ME A RING.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

GREAT TO MEET YOU.
GO OUT THERE AND KILL 'EM.

DO IT.
OKAY.

NOW I'M NERVOUS.
OH, GREAT.

IT'S GO TIME, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

SO AGAIN, LANCE,
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

AND LET'S HAVE
A GREAT SHOW.

<i>( audience applauding )</i>

MY GUEST TODAY
IS MR. LANCE CLAYTON.

LANCE'S 15-YEAR-OLD SON KYLE
TRAGICALLY TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

BUT FROM THIS TERRIBLE
STORY OF LOSS

AROSE ONE OF HOPE.

HERE HE IS TO SHARE THIS POWERFUL
STORY, MR. LANCE CLAYTON.

THANKS SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.

THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
WE KNOW IT TAKES GREAT
COURAGE FOR YOU TO DO THIS.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

<i>NOW, LANCE--</i>

<i>IS IT ALL RIGHT</i>
<i>IF I CALL YOU LANCE?</i>

YES, THAT'S MY NAME.

( woman giggles )

ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS
IS FOR A PARENT TO LOSE A CHILD.

YES.YES IT IS.

TELL US ABOUT
YOUR SON KYLE.

IT'S DIFFICULT,
ISN'T IT?

YEAH.

HE WAS A SWEET BOY.

KIND.

I'M SORRY.
HE WAS A SWEET BOY.

( laughs )

I'M SORRY. - BUT THERE WAS
A LOT BREWING UNDERNEATH?

<i>THE TRAGEDY IS I DIDN'T</i>
<i>KNOW UNTIL HIS DEATH</i>

HOW SAD HE WAS
OR PROFOUND.

MMM.
<i>( laughing )</i>

HERE'S A TISSUE
FOR YOU.

<i>PROFOUND.</i>
<i>INDEED PROFOUND.</i>

INDEED.

"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

THIS IS SO BEAUTIFULLY
WRITTEN.

I JUST--
YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,

I DIDN'T KNOW-- I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.
HE WAS A GREAT WRITER.

<i>YES, THIS IS REALLY</i>
<i>REMARKABLE WORK.</i>

<i>NO MATTER WHAT PAGE</i>
<i>I TURN TO,</i>

THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
THAT REALLY MOVES ME.

I WANT TO READ THIS.
<i>OKAY.</i>

"IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO BE A GOOD PERSON

<i>OR TO BE THOUGHT OF</i>
<i>AS A GOOD PERSON?</i>

<i>I'M SO SICK</i>
<i>OF LIVING A LIFE IN FEAR</i>

<i>OF BEING FOUND OUT</i>
<i>FOR THE PHONY I AM,</i>

<i>A LIFE WHERE I DON'T TRUST</i>
<i>ANYONE'S INTENTIONS,</i>

<i>INCLUDING MY OWN."</i>

WOW, THAT IS REALLY DEEP.

HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS
WRITTEN BY A 15-YEAR-OLD.

HE WAS AN OLD SOUL.
MMM.

YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
THAT I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

IN THE MIND
OF A TEENAGER.

ALL I'M SAYING IS,
KYLE MADE A MISTAKE.

IF YOU'RE THAT DEPRESSED,

REACH OUT TO SOMEONE.

AND REMEMBER, SUICIDE
IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

YOU WANT MY JOB?
NO.PLEASE, DANA, NO. THANK YOU.

AGAIN, THE BOOK,
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."

<i>AND MY GUEST HAS BEEN</i>
<i>LANCE CLAYTON.</i>

<i>( audience applauding )</i>
THANK YOU.

YOU WERE SO GOOD!

THANKS, DOLL.

AND I'M SO GLAD
YOU USED MY TITLE.

IT'S A GREAT TITLE.

( phone ringing )

HELLO?

LANCE, HI.
IT'S BERT GREEN.

HI. - <i>You were so great</i> on "Dr. Dana."

OH, THANKS, BERT.

IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS LIKE
WATCHING A BALLET.

<i>Hey, do you have time</i>
<i>to meet tomorrow?</i>

<i>Because there's a number</i>
<i>of publishers</i>

WHO ARE DYING

TO MEET WITH YOU.
WELL, REALLY, NO.

ACTUALLY WE HAVE
TO HEAD BACK TOMORROW.

THEY'RE DEDICATING THE SCHOOL
LIBRARY IN KYLE'S HONOR.

GOOD FOR HIM.
I MEAN, GOOD FOR YOU.

THAT'S GOOD.

HEY, LET'S DO IT SOON.

<i>Because this book is hot.</i>

<i>It's like a volcano</i>
<i>on the sun.</i>

WOW.
THAT'S A LOT OF HEAT.

<i>I'm gonna get a hold</i>
<i>of you soon.</i>

OKAY? BYE.

LANCE, LANCE.

OH, GOD.
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

OH, YOUR BOOK
IS ON FIRE.

OH.
IT IS.

THIS IS--
THIS IS BILL TOBIN.

HI.
FROM SIMON & SIMON.

CARL KLIENMAN FROM
HOWARD PUBLISHING. - HI.

AND THIS IS GEORGE KENNY,
FROM KAUFMANN PRESS.

THEY LOVE YOUR BOOK
AND THEY WANNA MEET WITH YOU.

IT'S TRUE.
REALLY.

WE'RE NOT GONNA BOTHER
WITH THAT RIGHT NOW.

THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK
WITH YOU AFTER THE DEDICATION, OKAY?

GOOD.
OKAY?

AND THEY ALSO WANT
A BOOK OF YOURS TOO.

THAT'S AMAZING.
YEAH.

OKAY.
SEE YOU IN THERE.

I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,
LAMB CHOP.

THANKS.

MR. CLAYTON.

BRUCE HORNSBY.

WE WROTE MR. HORNSBY
AND HE CAME.

HEY, MAN, WHEN I HEARD
WHAT A FAN KYLE WAS

I THOUGHT,
HOW CAN I SAY NO?

All:
<i>AW.</i>

THANKS.
Girl: <i>GOD, HE'S SO SWEET.</i>

Girl:
<i>BRUCE HORNSBY.</i>

I'D LIKE TO DEDICATE
THIS SONG TO MY BIGGEST FAN,

KYLE CLAYTON.
<i>( applauding )</i>

<i>( playing piano )</i>

<i>* ANOTHER SONG</i>
<i>CAME AND WENT *</i>

<i>* LIKE THE TIMES</i>
<i>THAT WE SPENT *</i>

* HIDING OUT
FROM THE RAIN *

* UNDER THE CARNIVAL TENT

* I LAUGHED
AND SHE'D SMILE *

* IT WOULD LAST
FOR A WHILE *

* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GOT *

<i>* TILL YOU LOSE IT</i>
<i>ALL AGAIN *</i>

<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>THE MANDOLIN RAIN *</i>

<i>* LISTEN TO THE MUSIC</i>
<i>ON THE LAKE *</i>

<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>MY HEART BREAK *</i>

<i>* EVERY TIME</i>
<i>SHE RUNS AWAY *</i>

<i>* LISTEN TO</i>
<i>THE BANJO WIND *</i>

* A SAD SONG
DRIFTING LOW *

* LISTEN TO
THE TEARS ROLL *

<i>* DOWN MY FACE</i>
<i>AS SHE TURNS TO GO *</i>

<i>* LISTEN TO THE TEARS</i>
<i>AS THEY ROLL *</i>

<i>* DOWN MY FACE</i>
<i>AS SHE TURNS TO GO. *</i>

MR. CLAYTON,

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

I'VE ALWAYS FELT
NOT ENOUGH.

MY DAD

RIDES ME
ALL THE TIME.

HE CALLS ME A LOSER.

I ALMOST KILLED MYSELF

UNTIL KYLE'S NOTE
AND BOOK CAME OUT.

IT SAVED MY LIFE.

I KNOW HE'S LOOKING
DOWN ON YOU SO PROUD.

THANKS, PETE.

<i>( applause )</i>

THANK YOU,
BRUCE HORNSBY.

<i>WELCOME STUDENTS,</i>
<i>FACULTY</i>

<i>AND GUESTS.</i>

TODAY

WE CELEBRATE KYLE.

KYLE HAS SHOWN US
SO MANY THINGS;

HOW FLEETING THE TIME

WE SPEND ON THIS EARTH
REALLY IS.

<i>KYLE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.</i>

<i>THROUGH HIS BOOK</i>

<i>AND THROUGH OUR HEARTS</i>
<i>HE WILL LIVE ON.</i>

TODAY WE DEDICATE
THIS LIBRARY

IN HIS SPIRIT.

A TRIBUTE TO HIS DEEP
INTELLIGENCE

<i>AND TO THE PROFOUND IMPACT</i>
<i>HE MADE ON ALL OF US</i>

<i>IN THE BRIEF TIME WE WERE</i>
<i>FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW HIM.</i>

AND NOW TO ACCEPT
THIS HONOR ON HIS BEHALF,

I GIVE YOU HIS FATHER

<i>MR. LANCE CLAYTON.</i>

( crowd cheering )

YOU GUYS
DIDN'T LIKE KYLE.

BUT THAT'S OKAY,
I DIDN'T EITHER.

I LOVED HIM.

HE WAS MY SON,

BUT HE WAS ALSO
A DOUCHE BAG.

HE WASN'T VERY SMART

AND HE DIDN'T KILL
HIMSELF.

KYLE DIED ACCIDENTALLY
WHILE MASTURBATING.

<i>I MADE IT LOOK LIKE</i>
<i>A SUICIDE</i>

AND I WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE.

I ALSO WROTE HIS JOURNAL.
THANK YOU.

THANKS.

YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.

YEAH.

Lance's voice:
