[dramatic music playing]




it's been over a year 
since the last time we spoke.

And thanks to Robert, 
my modeling career

is really taken off.

I'm not so sure 
about a relationship.

He wants to control 
my whole life.

Sometimes, I wonder 
if he really loves me

or just the money 
I make modeling for him.

Lately, I've been thinking 
about Two Moon Junction.

Remember when Mother 
would take us there

for Sunday picnics?

I wonder if Grandma Belle 
still has those home movies

of Mom and me rowing 
around the lagoon

and playing 
in front of Two Moon.

I still have the music box 
that Mom gave me that day.

You were already in high school 
by then,

busy with cheerleading 
and boys.

After Mom drowned,

Nana Belle just seemed 
to close up inside.

It was like she blamed 
Two Moon for Mom's accident.

She wasn't very interested 
in me anymore, either.

I guess I reminded her 
too much of Mom,

always so independent.

I know you're still upset 
with me for coming to New York

without telling anyone,

but we both know Nana 
would not have let me go.

Her birthday is next week.

And I'm catching a plane 
after my show

to help her celebrate.

She won't be around forever, 
you know.

Besides, I'd like to see 
Two Moon again.

And, who knows, 
she might even be happy

to see me.

Maybe you could join us.

We'd certainly have a lot 
to talk about.

It's been a long time, April.

I hope we'll see 
each other soon.

Take care.

Love, Savannah.

[distant vehicles honking]

[rock music playing]

â™ª Look out â™ª

â™ª We're not talking

let's get our shit together.

Mr. Lee is in the house.

Let's get it together, people.

Jerry, I like it.

Steve, get rid of
that chest hair.

another nosebleed.

Mia's probably
purging in the can.

Hey, glad you could make it.

Well, I got to keep up
my reputation.

I've got your ticket

-for your flight and...
-Thank you.

...left you time to schmooze
and Robert's not too happy

about you leaving.


Okay, it's Jewels.
We're back.

We're jamming.
It's the blowout

for the truly hip
and demented Cleo,

New York's fave designer.

And in a few minutes,
we're gonna go backstage

and behind the scenes
so just you stay tuned.

â™ª Make me swim some moreâ™ª

â™ª I've been hurt babe 
More like you â™ª

â™ª Never satisfied 
Can't you see the truth? â™ª

â™ª Something is burning 
Something is dying â™ª

Silvee, thanks for this hat.
I love it.

You're welcome, Savannah.
I'll be right back.

-Okay.
-How's my girl?

Exhausted. I can't wait
to get out of the city.

Silvee, remember,
lots of volume, please.

I am comping Glamour at Club 99
for later.

I want you on the October cover,
okay?

So, sit next to Ed Worth.

Hon, you know I'd love to,
but I can't.

-The plane leaves at ten-thirty.
-I'll change it.

What's a few days difference,
anyway?

Then you can do
the Saint Thomas shoot as well.

Wait a second.

I have had plans to go
to Nana's birthday for months.

You can't just change it.

just showed.

We'll discuss it later, okay?

Barn!
From Jeffrey Mason.

Is he that kiss up over
at Benton and Wily?

I don't remember.

Ah. Whoever he is,
it doesn't matter.

You are gonna knock
Paulina's sorry ass

right out of the checkout lane.

[rock music playing]

â™ª I get crazy, baby

â™ª Got me spinning round


Are you ready?
You look bloody fabulous.

Really?

With another man â™ª

â™ª I get crazy 
Don't you understand? â™ª

â™ª But you said you love me 
For eternity â™ª

So, you don't just do clothes,

you spin [indistinct]
of philosophy.

What's the dirt?
Mushrooms, right?

I like things that hold
fabric together.

I like hooks, and eyes, and...

clasps, and zippers,

and buttons, and bows,
but most of all,

you know what I like?

You know what I like?


I like...

Velcro.

And the reason I like Velcro
is not for what you'd expect.

It is because I like the sound
it makes when you pull it apart.

It kind of goes kawwwk!


â™ª Let me go, babe

â™ª Let go, you home girl

â™ª Oh, yeah

But what is your philosophy?

My show is Vertigo.

It is about spinning
out of control.

It is about climbing
the stepladder of success

and getting a nosebleed.

And looking down
at all the pond scum.

And thinking,
I'm better than you.

No?

Yes?

What was the question?


â™ª Emotions I seek 
To someone you like â™ª

â™ª And brings them alive

â™ª You walk into the vision, 
Captured like spellâ™ª

â™ª Blinded with a reasonâ™ª

let's go, you're up!


â™ª Love is just like war â™ª

â™ª We conquer them

â™ª Stronger once whim

â™ª Lovers stand apart

â™ª Soldiers in battle

â™ª Work

â™ª Love is just like war â™ª

â™ª Stand up and fight

â™ª Knowing what's right

â™ª Trapped in a prison of lies

â™ª Warriors â™ª

â™ª Quiet victory


Savannah, get back out there!

do you think you're doing?

What the hell
were you doing with Gina?

Savannah, stop.

This is childish
and unprofessional.

You've got interviews.
I've booked Club 99.

We can discuss this later.

I won't be around later.

-[Ronnie] Robert?
-Savannah?

-[Ronnie] Robert?
-Savannah!

They loved it.

They're all out there waiting
to tell you what a genius--

Ronnie, handle her.

Savannah?
Savannah?

Be careful, okay.
He could make New York

one hell of a black hole.

Ronnie, I'll call you.

Savannah, don't forget
about the Saint Thomas shoot.

[train chugging]

[country music playing]

[train horns blow]

[brakes screeching]

-[woman] Thank you.
-[man] Thank you.

[indistinct chatter]

[car engine revving]


There's something about
traveling always zaps

the life right out of you,
don't it? [laughs]

Long time
since you've been home?

Yes.

to Charlie Newman, are you?

You favor him?

No. Belle Delongpre?

Belle Delongpre?
You the model?

Ha! [laughs]

You know my daughter
gets all them magazines. Hmm.

Well, then you must be
April's little sister.


You like New York?

I've been lucky there.

[country music playing]

[indistinct chatter]


Well, now, look at here.
Savannah Delongpre.

Lord, have you have grown.

Mr. Bowman,
you haven't changed a bit.

How are you?

Well, now, tobacco don't hold
the same glory it used to.

-And Mrs. Bowman?
-Mrs. Bowman?

She don't hold the same glory,
either.

So, did it get here in time?

Oh?
Special ordered it.

I special ordered it.

Oh, wonderful.
And the engraving?

Came out perfect.

Oh, thank you.
She's going to love this.

I'm gonna take
some flowers, too.

-How much?
-No. Flowers for a flower.

You probably don't remember me.

Henry Walker.
I was a friend of your Momma's.

Oh?
Nice to meet you.

Well, Mr. Bowman,
thank you so much.

Now don't you be
a stranger here, you here?

I won't.

She turned out the spitting
image of her mom.

Hard to believe,
her being so plain.

[country music playing]

[horse snorts]


-[Savannah] Good-bye.
-[man] Bye now.

[country music playing]

Mom's car.

I don't know why
I keep that old thing around.

It took a week to get it out
and running.

Nana Belle!

Um, these are for you.

Store bought flowers

are a waste
of your good money, Savannah.

And what's that you're wearing?

Where's your luggage?

Oh, they lost it.

Well, then, I guess that means
you'll have to get some things

out of the back room.

Come on in.

You know where everything is.

Dinner's at 8:00 sharp.

I don't like it cold.

[dramatic music playing]

[clock ticking]

Bean!

It's so good to see you.

Let me look at you.

Oh, ain't you something.

Oh.

So glad you're here.

Let's go up.

Get comfortable,

relax, and I'll make us
something cool to drink.

How about a nice cold glass
of fresh lemonade?


[dramatic music playing]

You are a sight for sore eyes.

Come over here and talk to me.
I have so much to tell you.

What about Mr. Lee?

Is he treating you right, Bean?

Oh, Ruth, I don't know
about anything anymore.

Are you all right?

I'm just glad to be here.

[dramatic music playing]

[bell dinging]

All right.

[Belle laughs]

Savannah,

if you parade around
in those old things,

people are gonna say
that the Delongpres

can't afford a decent standard
of living.

Well, this would cost
a fortune in New York.

Well, that's the silliest thing
I ever heard.

Oh, no thank you, Ruth.
Maybe just some salad.

No wonder you never fill out.

You're always gonna be scrawny
if you don't eat something

that sticks to your bones.

I just don't know.

Thank you.

Thank you, Ruth.

you'd bring Mr. Lee home

with you this time, so I could
have a proper introduction.

I'm not seeing Robert anymore.

Savannah, if you're not careful,
you're never gonna settle.

Then what will you do?

I have a career, Nana.

You change clothes for a living.

You know,
I was thinking about going

to the summer place tomorrow.

Well, I rented it.

Until I sell it.

You-- You're selling Two Moon?

I'll have my brandy
on the veranda, Ruth.

Please.

[crickets chirping]

Why are you selling it?

That place has been nothing
but trouble.

But, Nana, she didn't--

It was the current,
not Two Moon.

I just wish you'd told me.

The stars are bright tonight.

[phone ringing]

Oh, Ruth, I'll get it.

Thank you, Ruth.

[phone beeps]

-Hello?
-[Robert] Savannah.

Savannah, don't hang up.

I want to apologize.

I missed you.

Robert don't.

I was stupid.

I don't know
what I was thinking.

I just--
I just want you to come back.

For Saint Thomas?


Savannah?

Robert, I'm not sure
there is an us anymore.

When will you be back?

I don't know. It's late.
I got to go.

[phone beeps]

[projector whirring]

Savannah, it's late.

Nana Belle, come watch with me.

No.
It's too late for me.

Don't stay up too long.

Tracy's coming by tomorrow

to go over the plans
for the party.

[dramatic music playing]

Hi.

Hi, Mommy.


No mercy, huh?

Come on,
let's play one more time.

-No. Let's get a drink.
-Come on.

-Gosh.
-Oh! Oh, man!

You know,
I think I could beat you

if you didn't look so good.

Bert?

So, who else was there?

Uh, Remember Vaughn Woodman?

In our Biology class.

Hey, Bert, honey,
playing so hard

-might give you a stroke.
-Oh, that's good.

-You're really mean, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

Mm. Hey, Junior.

You girls have fun, all right?

-I got to run.
-Bye.

-Bye-bye.
-So, Vaughn?

-Oh, Vau-- Vaughn!
-The one with the, uh,

with the real long hair, right?

-All right.
-Always so damn proud of it?

-Right.
-Completely bald.

No?

Oh, he looks so pathetic.

-Oh, gosh.
-So, you two are happy?

Oh, yeah.
Of course, we are.

So, let's see here now,
we've got the--

we got the wine.
We got the hors d'oeuvres.

The music? There is
a string quartet I use a lot.

Oh, you know what?

I don't think she's gonna want
to go for some big fuss.

-You know how she is?
-Oh, sure. Sure.

My whole damn life.
Boy this heat is getting to me.

You know what?
I don't miss it.

Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my gosh!
The baby just kicked.

-What? Oh, oh, okay.
-Put your hand and feel that.

Oh! You got a future linebacker
in there.

Now, see, if he's a boy,
we're gonna make him a junior

-'cause Bert likes that.
-Bert junior.

Foyer's full of roses
from Mr. Lee.

-Oh, you're kidding?
-Hmm.

Oh, aren't you just Miss Lucky.

See, now, McDonalds is about
as romantic as Bert gets.

Oh. Do you mind if we finish
this up tomorrow? I--

Oh, no. No. Besides.
my feet are real swollen--

-Okay.
---and junior, here,

she's getting restless.

Oh, Here. Let me help.
Let me help. Okay.

Are you leaving?

Oh, just for a little bit.

I hope you're not
going out there.

I'm a big girl, Nana.

So was your mother.

I'll be fine.

[dramatic music playing]

[birds chirping]

[dramatic music playing]

[crickets chirping]

[metal clanks]

[dramatic music playing]

Savannah?

[water pattering]

Slothfulness is not a virtue,
Savannah.

Did you know the foyer

-is full of roses?
-I know.

I wish he'd leave me alone.

Well, you know
the proper thing to do

is just call him and thank him.

I'm not ready
to talk to him yet.

Every blossom fades, Savannah.

Don't think you won't.

[dramatic music playing]

[Savannah whistling]

Henry Walker is here
and you're going with him

to the charity event
instead of your grandma.

What?
What are you...

Her leg is acting up again.

Well, tell me,
how's your cousin Freddie?

-He's doing better.
-I don't believe it.

Nana, could I speak to you
for a moment, please?

Savannah, get dressed.

You'll keep
the Dawson's waiting.

I'm sorry. I thought...

Well, you knew Henry'd be here.

Hurry up.

I'll be just a minute.

Take your time.

She's lovely.


Whoa! [laughing]

We made the first heat.

Great.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be bored.

I doubt you play much croquette
in New York.


You know, I know you're here
because of your grandmother.

Well, she does have a way
of getting her way.

Oh, don't I know it.

You know, it took all my powers
of persuasion to get her

to rent out Two Moon
after having it on the market

for a good year.

-That long?
-Yes, sir.

So, it wouldn't be
just standing still

eating up property tax.

Mm.

You know,
it's just too out of the way.

Oh.
Too big to heat.

You know, people want efficiency
these days, not charm.

Who's renting it?


Probably for storage.

They want to lease to buy.

Finally get it out of my hair
if the bank approves them.

Oh, I'd hate to see it sold.

I just wish Nana had told me.

Why?
Are you interested?

Thought about it.

Well, you know the bank
would rather deal with you.

I mean,
you're absolutely no risk.

If you want,
I can talk to Bob Fisher?

Okay.
That'd be nice.


-[car engine stalling]
-[car door closes]

-Thanks for going.
-Thanks for taking me.

It would have been polite
to invite him in.

I've been polite all day.

[dramatic music playing]

[car engine revving]

[birds chirping]

[dramatic music playing]

[upbeat music playing]


Who are you?

The guy who pays the rent.
Who the hell are you?

The guy you pay the rent to.

I pay old lady Delongpre.

I'm Savannah Delongpre.

You manage a salvage company?

Something like that.

Let me guess.
You're just out here slumming?

No. I'm here to tell you
this isn't for rent anymore.

I'm buying it.

I'm sure you like
throwing your weight around

with the peasants,

but I got a lease
to buy going through.

You're too late.

My family's had a fortune
in that bank for years.

I doubt it.

And before you leave,
I want all this stuff

out of here.


"That's not a pig,
that's a dog."

And I said lady
I was talking to the dog.

Oh.

-I'm tired.
-Guess you had to be there.

-Ready?
-Get going. Yeah.

Yeah. You drive?

-Thank you for having us.
-Thanks for coming.

-Thanks for having us.
-[Bell] I wish you'd come more.

I think we're gonna have
to do that.

-Bye, honey.
-Come here. Thanks.

-Thanks. Thanks.
-Are you okay?

I'm great.

I mean, she's almost like this
every single solitary time

I'm in this house, now why's
it getting to you tonight?

Oh, it's not that.
It's just--

well, I had this run in with
the most irritating man today.

-Oh, really? Where?
-Two Moon. Got me in a mood.

Uh-huh. And what were you
doing out there?

He was so arrogant,
he actually thinks

he's gonna buy the place.
And you should see...

-Oh, yeah?
-...what he's done to it.

-He's got all this stuff.
-I bet he was cute.

It was like
his personal junk yard.

-Bet he was cute.
-Tracy?

You're going on too much
about it for him to be ugly.

-Really?
-Umm-hmm. You are.

I'll call you tomorrow.

-Bye.
-[Tracy] Bye.

[dramatic music playing]

[chandelier chimes]


[dramatic music playing]


[dramatic music playing]



[dramatic music playing]

[birds chirping]

[car engine revving]

in this town.

Excuse me.
I have an appointment.

Yeah.
I just had one.

When your
great grandfather cheated mine

out of Two Moon,
he just didn't take Two Moon.

He took his whole life
when he took that place.

[car engine revving]


Yes, ma'am, I did.

I just filed it [indistinct].

[indistinct chatter]

[dramatic music playing]

[clock ticking]

Did Great Grandpa
cheat Warren Gilbert

out of the title to Two Moon?

It's unladylike to burst
in a room like that, Savannah.

Did he?

I have one nerve left, Savannah,
and you're on it.

I want to know.

Who have you been talking to?

Warren Gilbert's great grandson.

Warren Gilbert
was an uncivilized animal.

I don't care what he was like!
Did we still the property?

There was a gentlemanly dispute
about the property lines.

But that's ancient history.
And no need to drag it up now.

And us having more money,
the court listened better?

Savannah?


[crickets chirping]

[country music playing]

[frogs croaking]

This place isn't yours, yet.
You still got to knock.

That swan used to be out front
before a hurricane came through.

I used to think it got tired
of being here and flew away.

What do you want?

You know you're wasted here.
You should go to New York.

This is beautiful.

I don't give a shit
about New York.

And unless you're here
to personally kick me out--

I'm sorry about my grandfather.
I didn't know.

You're gonna have
a hell of a battle on your hands

when you try to take this place.

I'm not an easy mark
like my grandfather was.

That's not what this is about.

We're not our grandparents.

We are who we are.

Look. Forget it.

I came here to apologize
but just forget it.

Where do you come off
being so arrogant?

I went out of my way to find out
if what you said was true.

[romantic music playing]


[romantic music playing]

Hey, girl.

Ha-ha.

Ronnie. Girlfriend.

Woo!

-My luggage.
-Well, you did ask.

Now, I can't believe
you are getting along

without all your shit.

You'd be surprised.

Come on, let's get you settled.

Savannah running around
at all hours by yourself

is asking for trouble.

People talk.

What do you do around here?
Watch the cars rust?


God, Ronnie,
I'm so glad you're here.

You know, Robert's been
a major pain in the ass

since you left him.
You know, I got to find out

what you people put in grits.

You look relaxed.

Oh, God, Ronnie.

Woo! Shit!
What's his name?

Shh!

Did you already?
You slut.


I want to know
every disgusting detail.

Oh, yeah.
He's got this great art.

I want you to check it out.

Is that your [indistinct]
talking or your ass?

[birds chirping]

[dramatic music playing]

[engine revving]

-[laughter]
-Did you sleep good?

Oh, yeah, great.

Cricket symphony
going in the background.

Remind me to get some bug spray.

Ooh.
Must be your perfume.

You mean the one you gave me?

Umm-hmm. So?
So?

Is this it?

You Southerner's
are some weird ass birds.

Fuck you, Ronnie.

I like it. I just might stay.

Whoa.

Whoa, girl.
Reality check, okay?

Robert's got you booked
for Christmas.

Screw Robert.

I don't get paid
enough for that.

Whoa!

I like it.

Have I ever seen this before?

Has he ever had a show?

I don't think so.

What are you doing?

Ronnie has some friends
who run some galleries

and I--
I was thinking that maybe--

I'm not interested.

Little tense, are we?

Look, I was just thinking--

Jake, I hope you realize
how good you are

and you can blow the critics
away with this.

You're in to all that, not me.

Don't try to drag me down
to some higher social level.

That's not what I'm doing.

Okay, okay.
I'm gonna go outside

and play with the crawdads
or something.

I'm sorry.
I didn't realize--

Take a look around, okay?

This is it.

This is me.

I know that.
I know that.

What are you doing?

-What was last night about?
-I'm not sure. Are you?

I don't think you mean that.
I said I was sorry.

We're having a party tomorrow
and I want you to come.

What?
Are you turning trader on me?

A Gilbert's never been behind
Delongpre line.

I thought we were past all that?

Starts at 4:00.

He reminds me of this rapper
I used to date.

MC Ice Pick.

I think his songs were so good
because he was such an asshole.

Law of proportion, girl.

Oh. I'm sorry he was so rude.

I don't know
what's wrong with him today.

He lives in the middle
of the fucking woods,

that's what's wrong with him.

You realize this could just be
a rebound thing.

Yeah. I know.


[classical music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

Watch your step, girls.

What's so funny in here?

Stop all that laughing.
No more fun.

Savannah and Belle, I want
to get a picture of you

cause I got my camera.
I need a new picture.

Can you just stand up

because I want to get
the sunlight coming in,

so I can catch it
on your pretty face.

Belle, I want to get a picture
of you and Savannah,

so could you two
stand up together.

Yeah.
There we go.

Let's get this in the frame.

Savannah could you move
a little bit closer to Belle.

I did want to
just take one picture

that was the idea.
Okay.

Belle, could you just put
your arm around Savannah there

so we can...

Just put your arm around.
There you go.

Smile pretty for the camera.

Say cheese.
Ah, that is a beautiful picture.

Excuse me.

-[Robert] Hi.
-Hi.

What are you doing here?

I just couldn't let it go
that easily.

Robert, don't you have a show?

Savannah, you're more important
than any show.

How nice of you to come.

-My pleasure.
-Lovely to see you.

You don't understand
I haven't been alone here.

-[indistinct]
-[man] Belle? Excuse me, love.

Can you come here a second?

[indistinct chatter]

They've had heat
between them for a lot of years

and they always end up
back on each other's doorstep.

They're cut the same.

Gilberts have no place
in this house.

I can see that.

-Come back with me.
-I'm not ready.

So, where is he today?

This has nothing to do with him.
-You're right.

It was just your way
of getting back at me.

Making me jealous.
It worked.

Robert?

You know you're mine.

You don't belong with anyone.

I'm not a piece of furniture.

-No. I know. I didn't mean that.
-Yes, you did. You did.

Look.
I have to get back.

[indistinct chatter]

A jolly good fellowâ™ª

â™ª For she's 
A jolly good fellowâ™ª

â™ª For she's 
A jolly good fellowâ™ª

â™ª Which nobody can denyâ™ª

Did I see you with Robert?

-Savannah?
-Henry, hi.

Is everything okay?

You look like
you're waiting for someone?

Well, I-- I thought I was,

but I guess not.

Oh, Savannah Delongpre,
Chelsy Parker.

It's nice to meet you.

I hope you're taking good
care of him.

Excuse me.

[clock ticking]

[crickets chirping]

He brought this tonight.

Why didn't he stay?

-He's a Gilbert.
-That's not my fault.

It's not his, either.

And besides, he saw you
entertaining another gentleman.

If you love him, honey,
don't wait.

There's too much waiting done
around here.

[dramatic music playing]

Where do you think you're going?

You can't stop me
from seeing him.

Savannah?

[crickets chirping]

[thunder rumbling]

[dramatic music playing]

[thunder rumbling]

[dramatic music playing]

[knocks on door]

-What do you want?
-I didn't know you were there.

That's right.
You were busy.

Oh, Jake, don't do this.
Don't shut me out.

-It's over with him.
-Didn't look over.

You don't understand.
Listen.

-Yeah. I do.
-No.

Yes. You and he
come from the same place.

-You're cut the same.
-That's bullshit.

-Listen to me.
-No. You listen to me.

I don't need this crap.

Remember what happened last time
you tried to throw me out?

Yeah.

You don't have to worry
about that happening.

Why is it this place
is always breaking my heart?

[thunder rumbling]

Oh, shit.

[dramatic music playing]


Oh.


You.

Come on.

[dramatic music playing]



[birds chirping]

[dramatic music playing]

[birds chirping]

I'm starving.
When is it ready?

Stop it. Stop it.

-You can't rush an omelet.
-Okay.

-Hi.
-Good morning.

I had no idea
you were so good

-in the kitchen.
-I'm serious.

Come here. Come here.

I can see that. I can see that.
So, I'll just sit over here.

-Yeah.
-That's it.

I'll sit over here by myself.

cooking's an art, you know.

It's a science. It's not an art,
it's a science.

What? Savannah,
this is almost ready.

-I know.
-Savannah, I'm not kidding.

-You're not kidding?
-I'm not kidding.

I'm not kidding.

-Oh, it's burning.
-What's burning?

-It's burning.
-Shit.

[dramatic music playing]

[Savannah laughing]

-You look damn good doing it.
-[chuckles]

Oh! Smell these vegetables.

You can't get this in New York.

Hey-hey!
Catch. Catch.

-What's that?
-It's a kite.

that's gonna be a problem.

Yes, Sir.

Let me get back to you.

-Mr. Lee?
-Henry.

It's real good to see you

-again, sir.
-How are you?

I had a real good time
at the party.

Henry, I must compliment you

on your town here.
It's quite beautiful.

-Hmm.
-A little quiet, but...

-[laughs]
-What would you say

-the population is?
-The pop--

well, we're growing so much
you wouldn't believe it.

you can go?

I'm doing all the work here.

Yes, sir.
She's, uh...

-She's lovely.
-I bet everyone was watching you

when you walked in
with her, huh?

-Well, yes.
-Felt nice, didn't it?

[clears throat] Mr. Lee, uh,
I've known Savannah

all her life.

In fact, I was friend
of her mama.

You had a good time, though,
didn't you?

Mr. Lee,

while you're here, I believe
you could be interested

in some development property
work down by the river

where we're getting ready
to make some good money on it.

-Henry?
-Hmm?

You trying to sell me
some swampland there?

-Well...
-Joking.

[dramatic music playing]


Was there something
you wanted, Mr. Lee?

I'd like to buy
you lunch, Henry.

[Savannah laughing]

Come here.


-[telephone ringing]
-[humming]

Delongpre residents.

Uh, this is Henry Walker. May
I speak with Savannah, please.

She isn't in.

But it's a-- it's real important
I speak with her.

It's regarding 
an offer of Two Moon.

I'll give her your message.

When do you expect her back?

I'd say she's gonna be tied up
for a while.

Fine.

Go! Go! Go!

-Oh, we got it! [screams]
-[Jake] Go! Go! Oh, no!

Oh!


All right. Nice job.

[dramatic music playing]

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, ready?

-Here you go.
-Hut.

Yes [indistinct].

I've never shown these
to anybody before.


when I was little.

I knew I had to come back.

There is just something
about this place.

you could work in New York.

-[Jake] I don't think so.
-[Savannah] Why not?

Jake, you're good.

You're really good.

I don't know about good.

I don't know if it's about that.

I was in New York
about five years ago.

I had the loft in the Village,
the trendy agent.

Everything.

Then I started making
these hideous hip pieces

I hated it.

Then I didn't
make anything at all.

This place...

This place saved me.

[dramatic music playing]

Hmm.

Hmm.

[dramatic music playing]


Here.

Thank you.

So, who says you need a VCR?

I don't know.
Are we missing the playoffs?


What?

I wish she were here.

Sometimes...

sometimes I just wish
I could talk to her.

She used to talk to me
all the time.

Nana never talked to me.

I remember the argument Nana
and she had.

I remember that night
she walked out the door

and she never came back.

After that...

after she drowned,

things changed.

Nana, she just kept pulling
more and more away.

And I always thought

that maybe one day she'd say,

"Good job, Savannah.

I love you, Savannah."

But she never did.

I left the minute
I turned eighteen.

Did you find what you
were looking for in New York?

I thought I had.

But I think
I only found part of it.

I promise I'll be there soon.

Uh-huh. Ciao.

Don't get up.


Well, I have to straighten
some things out with Robert.

He does control my career.

-You want me to come?
-No.

No. Besides,
I need a new change of clothing.


When are you back?

I don't know. When I, uh...

settle some things in New York
with Robert,

so he doesn't screw it up
with this French designer.

And, actually, it's kind
of boring business stuff.

What?

What? You expect me
to just stop modeling

just like that?
I mean, it's what I do.

You go back there you get
sucked in that life again.

Give me some credit, Jake.

You'll be there, I'll be here.

This is not a big deal.

I mean, this is what
we have planes for.

I can visit you,
you'll visit me.

I can't go back to that.

Jake,

don't make me
make a decision like this.

I think you already have.

I love you.

[birds chirping]

[engine revving]

Good morning.

Your grandma isn't up
too much of anything today.

Says the party did her in.

Why don't you take it in to her.

[knocks on door]


I left you a package.
Did you get it?

I don't need a new cane,
Savannah.

This is so good. Mm.

That really hit the spot.

Mm.

Now, that looks good.

-You want some?
-No.

I already feel
like Mrs. Mack truck.

I don't need more.

So, what's going on with you
and Jake?

I haven't seen much of you.
I could always use

-a little vicarious thrill.
-Oh, well, he's great.

-It's great.
-Uh-hmm. But?

But what?

Well, there's always
a but in there. But what?

He picks his toenails after,
or he's a pathological liar?

-No.
-There's always a but

after all the heavy
breathing stops.

He doesn't want me
to go to New York.

Uh-hmm. But what do you want?

Him. Both.

Oh, right. And I want Ed McMahon
to come to my door

and give me a check
for a million dollars.

this is different.

Uh-hmm.

Oh, Lord, I heard
that one before.


That does look good.

-I don't need anymore.
-Sure. Have it. Go ahead.

-No. I shouldn't. I shouldn't.
-Yeah.

-You don't mind?
-No.

Okay.

trying to get a hold of you.

Oh? Well, I've been staying out
at the summer place.

-Seems to be agreeing with you.
-It is. It is.

-I wish I'd known.
-Well, nobody did really.

Are you okay?

I'm sorry, Savannah.

The bank wouldn't wait.
You didn't pursue the deed.

Oh, that's okay. That's what
I stopped by to tell you.

I'm not buying Two Moon anymore.
I want Jake to have it.

Well, they refused his loan.

And Mr. Lee made
such a good offer.

-What?
-Well, I told your grandmother.

You talked to her?

Well, I tried to get to you.

Now, I had to let her know
about Mr. Lee's offer.

And then she didn't seem
to think you were interested

in the property anymore
and she wouldn't wait.

Well, I'll just go talk
to my grandmother

-and to the bank.
-I'm sorry, Savannah.

Paper's already signed.

-She's not here.
-I know.

She's okay?

Nothing happened?

She's okay.

I already told you,
I'm not interested in New York.

That's not why I'm here.

Then why are you here?

This is his wedding gift to her.

Robert bought Two Moon.

She said she was going
to New York.

She is.

With him.

They'll vacation here
between shows.

He's giving you two weeks
to vacate.

The hell he is.

[car engine revving]

-Where's Jake?
-He's already gone.

You helped Robert buy Two Moon.

He can make or break me,
Savannah.

It's just business.

Is it?

[birds chirping]

-Where is she?
-She isn't in.


Is there anything else
of Savannah's?

I think you have taken it all,
Mr. Lee.

Thank you, Ruth.

She's better off with me.

Oh really?

Is that why she's coming back
to New York?

She's going back
for the modeling.

You really think
she'll last out here

for more than a week?

She was confused.

She was just trying
to get back at me.

I don't believe that.

Believe it, pal.

She speaks three languages.

She's gonna own New York
in a year.

Do you really think
that you're enough for her?

Come on...

Haven't you figured it out yet?

You were just a distraction.

[door slams shut]

[car engine revving]

Oh, absolutely. I was thinking
two weeks she'd be ready for.

-Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
-What the hell do you think

-you're doing?
-Look. We'll be back

in a few days.
Let's talk logistics then, okay?

She looks great.
We'd love to.

Okay, ciao.

-Cleo has a new design for you.
-I don't care about Cleo.

you mean that?

You bought Two Moon.

For you.
As a wedding gift.

Savannah, I know you want
your independence.

And this other guy...

Forget about him.

Robert, it doesn't work.

It has never worked.

Give me another chance.

Maybe we should just
say goodbye now.

I made you.

I made myself.

Savannah? Savannah?
Savannah?

Maybe I shouldn't be
with your agency anymore.

Savannah?
Savannah?

You will regret this.

Don't tell me about regrets.

I'm not stiff and cold

and locked up
in a big empty house

with no one to love.

I won't listen to you
talk like that.

You won't listen to anything.

You won't feel anything.

I've waited for years for you
to look at me and smile

as if you were happy to see me.

Well, I'm not gonna
wait anymore.

My mother did not drown
on purpose.

And you can go on blaming her
and hating me

because I remind you
of her all you want.

But don't count on me
to be around for it.

Flight's at 8:00.

We'll be arriving back
in the 20th century.

Thank God, in time
for a late dinner

where we don't have to worry
about anyone seeing you all.

I want you to talk to her.

You talk to her, Robert.

I think I've already
done enough.

Don't give up on her.

I haven't.
She's given up on me.

[dramatic music playing]

[car engine revving]


One of these days you're gonna
stop letting people go.

That is, if the good Lord
let's you live long enough

to realize you've been wrong.

You may have lost
your true love,

but Savannah doesn't have
to lose hers.

[birds chirping]

I told Mr. Lee
I want Two Moon back.

I don't want it.

Savannah, when I first saw Jake,
I couldn't believe

how much he looked like
his granddaddy Luke.

Look. I don't want to talk about
what the Gilberts did or Jake.

Besides, it doesn't matter,
he's gone.

Savannah, wait.

I loved Luke Gilbert
with all my heart.

We used to meet out at Two Moon.

His daddy owned it.

It was the only place
we could go and be alone.

His daddy and my daddy
just hated each other.

I never did know why.

When they found out
we were seeing one another,

my daddy wanted
to send me away to school,

and his daddy told him
he'd kill him

if he ever stepped foot
near me again.

Did you?

We just couldn't be apart.

Luke was waiting for me
at the bridge one night.

But his daddy must have
followed him

because by the time I got there,
they were having

a terrible fight.

Luke was yelling about me.

And his daddy was hitting him
every time he said my name.

He was hurt so bad.


if I've been hard on you,

it's because you're so much
like your mother

and so like me
and I was afraid

that what happened to her
would happen to you.

She drowned because
of the current, Nana.

It was an accident.

It would please me so much
if you would stay

and have dinner with me tonight.

[dramatic music playing]


And sometimes we'd have up
to ten changes

in less than a half--
in less than a half hour.

And rushing, you know,
two minutes to change

completely different styles.

Oh, it's just [indistinct].


Well, I don't know.

[birds chirping]

Need help?

Oh. No. Thanks.
I just...

What time's the train?

Um, at 8:00.

-It's a nice ride to Atlanta.
-Yeah.

And he's a great designer.

I think it's gonna be
a good show.

-I'm glad you stayed.
-Me too.

Okay.

I love you, Nana Belle.

I love you, darling.

Now you be careful.

[car door closes]

[dramatic music playing]

[horse neighs]


[dispatcher over PA] 
...Birmingham, Houston, Atlanta.

[dramatic music playing]

[woman chuckles]


Did you miss me?

[indistinct chatter]

[woman laughs]

it takes to get to Atlanta?

[man 2] It takes about an hour
and a half, sir.

[dramatic music playing]

[train horn honks]

[train bell ringing]

[dramatic music playing]
