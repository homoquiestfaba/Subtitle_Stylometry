â™ª WITH FRECKLES ON YOUR SKIN â™ª  

â™ª ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF TROUBLE â™ª

    â™ª BUT MOSTLY ALWAYS IN â™ª    

    â™ª USING DAD'S NECKTIE       
    FOR THE TAIL OF YOUR KITE â™ª 

    â™ª USING MOM'S LIPSTICK      
    FOR THE LETTERS YOU WRITE â™ª 

â™ª LITTLE LULU LITTLE LULU â™ª     

        â™ª THERE'S NO ONE        
        QUITE AS SMART â™ª        

        â™ª DOESN'T MATTER

        â™ª YOU'RE DOING IT       
        WITH YOUR HEART â™ª

â™ª THOUGH THE CLOCK SAYS 7:30 â™ª  

    â™ª IT'S REALLY AFTER 10 â™ª    

    â™ª LOOKS LIKE LULU'S BEEN    
    REPAIRING IT AGAIN â™ª        

    â™ª THOUGH YOU'RE WILD        
    YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE BLUE â™ª

        â™ª JUST THE SAME â™ª       

            â™ª LULU â™ª            

        â™ª OH LULU â™ª             

    -SEE YOU TOMORROW!          
            -BYE.               
        -BYE, LULU.             

    -LULU! TIME FOR YOUR BATH!  

        -WHO NEEDS A BATH?      

-LULU! YOU'RE COMPLETELY FILTHY!

    -NOT COMPLETELY, MOTHER.    
    I KEPT MY SHOES ON          

    SO MY FEET ARE CLEAN.       

    -AND YOU'VE TRACKED MUD     
    ALL OVER THE HOUSE.         

INTO THE BATHTUB THIS INSTANT!  

-WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GONNA LIVE 
IN A HOUSE WITH NO RULES...     
    AND NO BATHTUB!             

I FORGOT TONIGHT WAS BATH NIGHT.

    I COULD HAVE GOTTEN         
        REALLY DIRTY.           

I'LL SAIL IN THE TUB AND MAKE   
    BELIEVE IT'S THE OCEAN.     

EXCEPT THE WATER DOESN'T LOOK   
    LIKE THE OCEAN. IT'S        
    NOT GREEN ENOUGH.           

            HMM...              

    I'LL JUST BORROW SOME       
    OF MOM'S GREEN INK.         

    HMM... NOT GREEN ENOUGH.    

    -LULU, BREAKFAST IS READY!  

            OH!!!               

    LULU, YOU LOOK AWFUL!       

        HOW DO YOU FEEL?        
        -A LITTLE HUNGRY.       

-THERE'S NO TIME TO EAT. WE     
HAVE TO GET YOU TO A DOCTOR.    
        -BUT MOM--              

        -NO BUTS. I'M           
    CALLING AN AMBULANCE.       

    -OH BOY, AN AMBULANCE!      

            WHOA!               

            WHOA!               

        -NOW, WHAT SEEMS        
        TO BE THE PROBLEM?      

    -SHE'S GREEN, DOCTOR.       

        -MY! SO SHE IS!         

        HOW DO YOU FEEL?        
            -HUNGRY.            

            -AHH...             

            -AH...              

            OH...               

        HMM, HMM...             

            AH, AH...           

            HMM...              

        HMM, HMM...             

WELL, SHE'S GREEN ALL RIGHT.    
I'LL HAVE TO GET IN TOUCH       
    WITH Dr. PEEL.              

    HE'S ONE OF THE BEST SKIN   
    SPECIALISTS IN THE COUNTRY. 

    AND Dr. GUESSIT TOO.        
HE'S AN EXCELLENT DIAGNOSTICIAN.

        -WILL THAT HURT?        
    -NOT A BIT... I THINK.      

    BUT IN THE MEANTIME,        

        I WOULDN'T WORRY.       
    IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION, 

SHE PROBABLY WON'T GET ANY      
GREENER THAN SHE ALREADY IS.    

    -I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO      
    HOME NOW AND WAIT.          

            AHH!!               

OH, OH! IT'S THAT BUSYBODY,     
        Mrs. ANGLE.             

    QUICK, LULU, HIDE.          
-GOOD MORNING, Mrs. MOPPET.     

    I NOTICED YOU LEAVING       
    THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.        

I HOPE IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.    

    -OH NO. JUST A... A...      
    -A CHECK-UP, I SUPPOSE?     

        -YES, THAT'S RIGHT,     

        A CHECK-UP.             
    -WHY, IS THAT LULU?         

ISN'T SHE CU.. OOH! SHE'S GREEN!

OH DEAR! SHE MAY BE CONTAGIOUS! 

        -AH, NOW EVERYBODY      
        IN TOWN WILL KNOW.      

        OF ALL THE NERVE!       
        [DOORBELL]              

-HI, Mrs. MOPPET. IS LULU HOME? 

    -OH! IT'S YOU, TUBBY.       
        YES. COME IN.           

    -I HEARD ABOUT LULU         
    BEING GREEN AND... I        
    THOUGHT I'D COME AND SEE    

IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO.   
-THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, TUBBY.
        -HI, TUBBY.             

-HECK! I WAS HOPING... I MEAN,  
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GREENER.     

    -MAYBE I'LL GET GREENER.    
        -WELL, LET'S MAKE       
        THE BEST OF IT.         

I HAVE TO STEP OUTSIDE FOR      
A SECOND. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.   

-TUBBY IS SO UNDERSTANDING.     

        [CIRCUS MUSIC]          
    -RIGHT THIS WAY, KIDS!      

    ONLY 50 CENTS TO SEE LULU,  

    THE GREEN GIRL!             
    FEEL HER GREEN SKIN.        

            -OUT! OUT!          

        ALL OF YOU!             

        -HEAR HER MOTHER'S      
        ANGRY SCREAMS!          

    -TUBBY, HOW COULD YOU?!     

-YEAH, TUBBY, HOW COULD YOU?!   

    -OH... I WAS GONNA GIVE     
    YOU HALF THE MONEY, LULU.   

    -HALF THE MONEY?            
OH, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?    

            -GRRR!              
            -UH?                
            -AH!                

HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?        
-UH... UH... THROUGH THE DOOR.  

    -WELL, YOU CAN GO RIGHT     
    BACK OUT THROUGH THE DOOR!  

    I'M GOING TO WRITE A        
    LETTER TO THE NEWSPAPER     
    AND TELL THEM WHAT I THINK  

    OF THEIR SNOOPY REPORTERS!  

    -WHOA! HE HAD SOME NERVE    
    COMING IN HERE LIKE THAT.   

    -IMAGINE THAT! EXPLOITING   
    A POOR LITTLE GIRL...       

    NOW WHERE DID MY INK GO?    
    -THERE'S NONE LEFT.         

    I USED IT ALL UP IN THE     
    BATHTUB LAST NIGHT.         
        -YOU WHAT?!             

    -I WANTED THE BATH          
    TO LOOK LIKE THE OCEAN,     
SO I POURED THE INK IN THE TUB. 

    -AND THEN YOU GOT IN THE    
    BATH WITH THE GREEN INK?    

        -YES. YOU TOLD ME       
        TO TAKE A BATH.         

        -OH, WONDERFUL!         

        -AFTER ALL THAT...      
        IT WAS ONLY INK?        

    -I COULD'VE TOLD EVERYONE   
    THAT IF YOU'D ASKED ME.     

    -YOU CAN ALL GO AWAY.       
    IT WAS ONLY GREEN INK.      

        -GREEN INK?             
        -GREEN INK?             
-AH... WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.    

        -HEY! THEY SPOTTED      
        A BOY THAT'S BLUE       

        ON MAIN STREET!         
        -A BLUE BOY!            
        -LET'S GO SEE!          

    -SEE YOU LATER, LULU.       
            [GULP]              

        -AND AS FOR YOU,        
    YOUNG LADY, TO THE BATH!    

-BUT I TOOK A BATH YESTERDAY!   

-I HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

-YES, MOM. I'LL NEVER SAIL MY   
BOAT IN THE GREEN OCEAN AGAIN.  

    MAYBE I'LL SAIL IT IN       
    THE RED SEA INSTEAD!        

        â™ª DO BE DO BE DO â™ª      
            â™ª LULU â™ª            

    -GOSH! IT'S RAINING.        

OH, I BETTER CALL TUBBY AND TELL
HIM OUR GAME'S WASHED OUT.      

IT'S ALWAYS RAINING. THIS IS    
THE SECOND TIME THIS MONTH!     

HELLO, TUBBY? OH, THAT'S YOU?...

YEAH. OH, THE GAME'S RAINED OUT.
    SO HOW ABOUT YOU COME       
        OVER HERE?              

    WE COULD PLAY INDOOR TAG.   

-AH, NOTHING DOING, LULU. I     
DON'T WANNA GET WET BECAUSE...  
        [SNIFFING]              

            -YECH!              
-BECAUSE I GOT THE SNIFFLES.    

            -BLAH!              
-HOW ABOUT YOU COMING OVER HERE?

    -NO WAY! I GOT A COLD TOO   
    AND I CAN'T BE OUT IN       
    THE RAIN EITHER.            

    -AH! YOU DIDN'T TALK        
    LIKE THAT A MINUTE AGO.     

I'M NOT GOING OVER THERE, LULU. 
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME OVER HERE.  

    -WELL, I'M NOT! SO GOODBYE! 

            [THUNDER]           

    TUBBY'S GOT SOME NERVE      
PRETENDING TO HAVE THE SNIFFLES.

IF THERE'S ANYTHING I HATE,     
        IT'S A LIAR.            

    MAYBE TUBBY DOES HAVE       
    A COLD COMING ON. HE        
    CATCHES COLDS AWFUL EASY.   

        I'LL GO OVER THERE.     

        IT'LL BE MORE FUN       

    THAN HANGING AROUND HERE.   

            WHOA!               

I HOPE TUBBY APPRECIATES THIS!  

-I KNOW I SAID I WASN'T GONNA,  
BUT... MAYBE LULU WASN'T        
FOOLING ABOUT HER COLD.         

    AH, THE POOR KID WILL       
    BE HAPPY TO SEE ME.         

        [KNOCKING]              
            -AH?                
    -HI, Mrs. THOMPKINS.        

    BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT       
    TO SEE ME TODAY.            
    -NO, I DIDN'T, LULU.        

ESPECIALLY SINCE TUBBY'S OVER...

-AT <i>MY</i>  HOUSE! WHAT'S LULU DOING
OVER AT MY HOUSE WHEN I'M HERE  
        AT HER HOUSE?           

            [RING!]             

            -HELLO?...          

            IT'S LULU.          

        -HELLO, TUBBY?...       
        WHAT'S THE IDEA?        

-I'M OVER AT YOUR HOUSE, SILLY. 
    COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW.   

-UH-UH! I CAME ALL THIS WAY TO  
SEE YOU. <i>YOU</i> COME BACK HERE!    

-YOU GOT A NERVE! I TOLD YOU,   
    I GOT THE SNIFFLES.         
        [SNIFFLING]             

    -WELL, I HAVE A PRETTY      
    BAD COLD IN MY HEAD         

AFTER COMING OVER HERE, TUBBY.  
    YOU COME BACK HERE.         

-NO WAY! YOU COME HERE. GOODBYE.

-HMM... I GUESS I COULD GO OVER 
    THERE. I HAVE TO GO HOME    
        SOME TIME ANYWAY.       

    -AND I'D LIKE TUBBY         
    TO COME HOME TOO. PLEASE    
    TELL HIM FOR ME, WILL YOU?  

    -I'LL TELL HIM ALL RIGHT!   

    I'M GONNA GIVE TUBBY...     
    -...A PIECE OF MY MIND!     

        -SOME NERVE!            

WHAT? HE LEFT? HE WENT HOME?    
    YOU MEAN TO <i>HIS</i> HOUSE?      

    -HE THOUGHT YOU WERE        
    GOING TO STAY THERE.        

        -I'M NOT GONNA GO       
        OVER THERE AGAIN.       
        -OKAY, DEAR.            

        JUST GET OUT OF         
        THOSE WET THINGS.       

        -I BET OLD TUBBY IS     
        JUST AS WET AS ME.      

        MAYBE HE'S GOT A        
        REAL BAD COLD NOW.      

HE MIGHT EVEN BE IN BED AND...  

            [COUGHING]          
            OH!...              

I MIGHT AS WELL GO OVER THERE.  

    TUBBY WILL BE REALLY        
        GLAD TO SEE ME.         

-WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH LULU,   
    ANYWAY? CAN'T SHE STAY      
        IN ONE PLACE?           

    -SHE'S HOME AND DRY BY NOW. 
    NOW I WANT YOU TO STAY PUT. 

    -IF LULU REALLY DOES HAVE   
        A COLD, I BET IT'S      
        PRETTY BAD BY NOW.      

         <i>WHAT IF SHE DIDN'T</i>     
         <i>MAKE IT HOME?</i>          
        <i>-HELLPPP!!</i>              

     <i>-WHAT IF SHE'S LOST</i>        
     <i>IN THE RAINSTORM?</i>          

             <i>-TUBBY!</i>            

    AH, YOU'RE WORSE            
    THAN A LEAKY FAUCET.        

I BETTER GET SOME TOWELS.       
[TUBBY OPENS THE FRONT DOOR.]   
            AH?                 

            TUBBY?              

        -I THOUGHT I TOLD       
        LULU TO STAY PUT.       

        AT LEAST I KNOW         
        WHERE TO FIND HER.      

    -I CAN'T LET TUBBY          
    GO OUT WITH WET FEET.       

        I HAVE TO CATCH HIM     
        AND BRING HIM HOME.     

    -HANG ON, TUBBY! YOUR       
    PAL LULU IS ON THE WAY.     

    -BOY, I'LL BE HAPPY         
    TO GET TO LULU'S HOUSE.     

            [DOORBELL]          
    -HEY! THERE'S NOBODY HOME.  

    I KNEW TUBBY WAS FAKING!    

    I BET HE'S OUT HAVING       
        FUN SOMEWHERE.          

-COME ON, LULU, LET ME IN!      
        [HE SNEEZES.]           

    -THAT'S THE LAST TIME       
    I EVER VISIT TUBBY.         

        -I'M NEVER GOING TO     
        LULU'S HOUSE AGAIN.     

        [DOORBELL]              
        -NOW WHERE DID          
        EVERYBODY GO? ARGH!     

        -HELLO? HELLO?          

TUBBY? LULU? Mrs. MOPPET? OH!   

    WHERE IS EVERYONE? OH!      

-A FINE THING! I GO ALL THAT WAY
    AND LULU WON'T LET ME IN.   

WOW! IT'S REALLY COMING DOWN.   

I DON'T CARE IF LULU <i>IS</i> SICK.   
    I'M GOING HOME TO STAY.     

            -AAAH!!!            

I'M LOCKED OUT OF MY OWN HOUSE! 

    -MA! WHERE ARE YOU?         
    AH, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?     

    I GOT IT! MY OLD PAL LULU.  

        -THERE'S ONLY ONE       
        THING I CAN DO.         

    -THIS TIME I'LL KICK        
    THE DOOR SO HARD, SHE'LL    
    HAVE TO LET ME IN.          

-I SURE HOPE OLD TUBBY'S        
BACK HOME. I CAN'T STAY         
OUT IN THE RAIN MUCH LONGER.    

    -THOSE KIDS CERTAINLY HAVE  
    SOME EXPLAINING TO DO!      

    -COLD OR NO COLD,           
WHEN I FIND TUBBY, HE'S         
HEADED STRAIGHT TO HIS ROOM!    

            -WHOA!              

            -AAAH!              

    -LOOK OUT, Mrs. THOMPKINS!  

        -AHH! OHH!              
        [BOTH]: AH?             

    -TUBBY, THERE YOU ARE!      
    -I'VE BEEN LOOKING          
    EVERYWHERE FOR YOU, LULU.   

            -LULU!              
            -TUBBY!             

    -WHAT KIND OF A GAME HAVE   
    YOU TWO BEEN PLAYING?       

        -I GUESS WE PLAYED      
        TAG AFTER ALL.          
        -RAINY-DAY TAG.         

    -LET'S GET HOME BEFORE      
    WE ALL CATCH COLD.          

    -MY COLD'S BETTER, MOM.     

    IT'S STOPPED RAINING, MOM.  

    I'M GOING TO LULU'S HOUSE.  

    -ALL RIGHT, TUBBY DEAR.     
            HAVE FUN!

    THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER      
    PLACE HE COULD BE.          

-THOSE GIRLS SURE ARE SILLY.
