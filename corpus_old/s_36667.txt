As you all know,
by the next time we meet...

this angel is going
to be my wife.

But don't let this distract you.
Our work is not done.

Where are we today?

Kids are killing each other
in school playgrounds.

Half nude women are on every
billboard and magazine cover.

Songs have more dirty words
than clean.

And yet I'm the one
they call crazy.

They don't know anything.
Do you know what I say?

Drop the pills and smokes
and come up for air.

We haven't exceeded our
humanity, we've destroyed it.

Let me remind you, children,
that God burned Sodom.

He burned Gomorra.

If the world doesn't want to
listen to what I have to say...

then we're headed straight back
into the fire, all of us.

So long as you all follow me,
not us.

There are few places left where
you can still see the stars.

Is this what you
wanted to show me?

Would that be enough?
.Yes, of course.

Sorry, Maxwell. You're trying to
teach me and I'm missing it.

That's not it.
That's it.

An engagement present
from me to you.

Are you serious?

That's incredible! I've always
wanted to take a cruise.

I wanted to surprise you.

I've made a decision, Trace.

It's timewe all got to know
the power of our crusade.

Oh, God!

It's no coincidence.

What's the matter?
You're shaking.

You're insane.
You are insane!

You misunderstood me.

Always playing games.

Where are you?

No one runs out on me.
You know that.

I'll find you.
Where could you possibly go?

Come on!

Nobody betrays me.

Remember, you're llstening to
Hot Vegas 102.

Hlgh tomorrow, 107,
2 degrees hotter than today.

How could you possibly
get arrested, it's legal here.

 42
Good win, freeze to that chair.

Do you want to tell me
what the hell these are?

Looks like atack
of case reports.

They 're yours, wise ass, late
and filled out incorrectly.

They 're all solved, aren't they?

God damn you!
This city isn't your playground.

I'm not your nursemaid to
watch after you...

so you will fill out
these reports correctly.

You will get back
on the street...

and remember you're a cop,
not a one man disaster area.

Get a hair cut.

Morning, chief.

Where's the fun in this?

.Morning, chief.
.Morning.

.Will you marry me?
.Very funny, uncle Roger.

Come here. Sit down.
Tell me where your dad is.

Let me guess, he's sick so he
sent you here to be my partner?

.He called my mum again.
.I thought he said he wouldn't.

Why?
Due to the restraining order?

You know Dad can't get enough
of a bad thing.

He wanted to get back together.
She wanted him to go to hell.

I'm sorry.

.I know he's out drinking.
.Everything will be okay.

.I promise.
.Yeah, you and everyone else.

Hi, could l just get a water?

Thanks.

I'm at the Sands of Time hotel.
You won't believe what's here.

I'll keep an eye on her
until you get here.

.Can I get you anything?
.No, thanks.

Oh, Christ.

.You can't do this, Kenny.
.I know.

Our shift started 2 hours ago,
so you're on my time.

I've got the bad attitude and
you're the stable one, remember?

It's just one drink, I swear.
I lost track of time.

.I called Donna again.
.Your daughter told me.

She came to the station
looking for you.

She's a tough kid,
but she needs a father.

And I need apartner
so the deal is this...

Either you stop this or lose
two more people from your life.

I'm gonna. I swear.
 
.Let's go.
.Hang on.

.Are we working or not?
.We're working right now.

L.V. Police department.
Can we have a word with you?

.Come here.
.Stop.

It's okay, I'm apolice officer.
Are you okay?

.What's going on?
.A typical night in Vegas.

.What's your name?
.Tracy.

Call 911, tell them where we
are and that shots were fired.

Have them send an ambulance.

Can't wait until the chief
hears about this.

My God!

.Let's go.
.Get out of the way.

Get out of here.

Somebody help me!

Get out of here.

Are you crazy?

You're crazy!

This is Det.
Roger Goodwin.

This is Det.
Roger Goodwin.

Currently travelling north bound
pursuing hotel shooting suspect.

This suspect is now driving
an L. V. P. D. Cruiser.

What's going on?

Chief, what a surprise.

I told you to
stay out of trouble.

Trouble seems to find me
wherever I go.

Hold on.

Don't cut me off.

Nice parking.

I'll tell Hacket you did it.

Get everyone ready.

He'd better not be
wasting my time.

Still no answer.

.Thank you.
.Thank you.

Welcome to the Sands of Time
Hotel. How may I help you?

I'm looking for a guest here.
Her name is Tracy Cantra.

With pleasure.

.No one here by that name.
.Are you sure?

Yes, Sir. I am.

Well, well...

My angel appears
to have lost her wings.

.You've got a visitor.
.Here?

Says you have something of his.
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

Excuse me.

I expected this to be
much bigger.

We never formally met.
Det. Goodwin, Metro division.

.I'm surprised to see you again.
.I've got more lives than a cat.

But not the guy we were chasing.
What you reap, what you sow.

I guess you do.

This must be what
you came for.

Thanks, for everything.
You were great there.

No big deal.

I don't want to be rude but
I have to finish getting ready.

Sure.

.Good luck, detective.
.You too. Break a leg.

Can I have your phone number?

I might need a statement.

I wouldn't have much to say.
I only saw the floor...

and I heard some shots
and I dialed 911, like you said.

.I may need to get hold of you.
.I'm sorry.

I don't give out my home number.
You can reach me here.

If you don't mind,
I have to finish getting ready.

See you around.

I wasn't drinking. I was taking
care of some business.

Remember what I told you
about lying.

Aren't I supposed to be telling
you about that stuff?

Along with 1OO other
things I'm learning on my own.

I'll be home tomorrow and we'll
spend some time together.

.Drink, Sir?
.No thanks.

.What was that, Dad?
.Here's Roger, I've got to go.

Let me talk to him.
.I love you, I gotta go.

.Dad?
.Everything all right?

.How's the show girl?
.Weird.

Weird like sexual weird?

Weird as in we need to hang out
here a little longer.

Come on.

Hello.
Can I help you?

.Where am I calling?
-The Sandsof Time Hotel.

.Thanks.
-You're welcome.

You know what I think?

That Roger's got a crush
on the show girl.

Maybe.

I'm telling you:
she's hiding something.

She had a look on her face like
a wall going up.

She seemed to shut down when
I mentioned the shooter.

Cocktail, sir?

.I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
.Don't even think about it.

Now.

Everybody out.

Get down. Come on.

Everybody out!

Get out of here.

Come on, move.

Move it. Let's go.

Move out.

Now.

Run.

It's chaos out here.
Requesting multiple back up.

Multiple back up.
We need everything you've got.

.Rise and shine.
.Is that you, Rog?

Come on, man.

I've got you.

Let's get out of here.

Run.

Chief's right.
You're a walking disaster.

Listen up.

Iwant to know who these
people are and who they're with.

And how they got into
that building. Lets move!

Who's she?

She's with the hotel show.
She says one of the guy 's got away.

Tracy, her cop friend
and his partner.

What cop friend?

Good looking guy. He said
his name was Roger something.

You gotta be kidding.
Get her out of here.

Chief.

Chief Hacket, L. V. P. D.
Who am I speaking to?

All you need to know
is I'm in control.

The hotel is completely sealed.
There's no way in or out.

I have hostages l won't
hesitate to kill.

To assume my powers are limited
is to make a big mistake.

Okay, I've got the message.
What exactly do you want?

Time and breathing room.

When I'm done I'll leave
this town far behind.

And what if I say no?

I'll show you which part
of no you don't understand.

Take cover.

.Any sign of her yet?
.Nothing yet.

I'm shutting the place down.

They 've sealed the entrance.
We can't get in or out.

The front entrance's blown out.

Everybody out.
Move, move.

She's not to leave
this building, understand?

Anyone trying to help her escape
l want dead.

It's this way.

Hello.

No signal.

.What is it?
.C4.

Let's see what's behind door 2.

What's going on around here?

Everyone's been through
and there's still no sign of her.

She's still in the building.

Gamer, what do you have?

A bunch of empty rooms but that
only covers 3O% of the hotel.

The other 7O% is about
3 million square feet.

If she's out there, it could
take days to find her.

We don't have days.

What was that?

Some of the bombs
were set on timers.

You told us to.

We were supposed to be
out of here by now.

Of course we were.

It was a simple operation.

I put my trust in you people
and you failed.

Are you incapable of carrying
out my vision?

No, Maxwell.

.We'll find her.
.That's right, we will.

Over my dead body and yours,
I'm not leaving without her.

Find her.

Ricky, we've had
a change of plans.

What's your status?

Almost done.
It's gonna be beautiful.

Good, someone I can count
on in this organization.

Listen carefully.
I need you to do one more thing.

All units,
this is the chlef speaking.

We have a full scale alert
at the Sandsof Time hotel.

Repeat, a full scale alert.
I mon route, E. T.A. 10 mins.

Have all emergency units
on stand by to receive.

We've got a full
scale tactical alert.

Swat team, fire fighters,
all avaliable police cruisers...

to the Sandsof Time hotel.

The structure is burning.
Hostages have been taken.

The structure is burning
and there are people inside.

Damn, Kenny.

.That was good bourbon.
.Good time to stop drinking.

.I'd like to die with a smile.
.We're not dying down here.

Kenny 's right. It's over.
There's noway out.

You too...

Fine.

Then if we're all about to die,
why don't you tell us why?

How would I know
any more than you?

You were running from the first
shot so drop the act.

Who are these cowboys?

They 're not cowboys
and they 're not robbers.

Not even terrorists.

They 're his personal army
sworn to his holy war...

convinced that they 're
saviors of the modern world.

They 'll do anything he says.
They 'll die for him.

.The guy on the dance floor.
.Yes, Maxwell.

How do you know all this?

Because I used
to be one of them.

Great! This is getting
better and better.

All emergency police and fire
units are responding.

The structure is burning
and hostages have been taken.

I repeat.
Hostages have been taken.

This isn't the first time.

Two years ago he blew up
a ship in San Pedro.

I remember, they never found
out who was responsible.

Did it ever occur to you to
tell somebody? Like the cops.

.Sowe wouldn't end up here.
.I was running for my life.

The cops couldn't catch him
or protect me, I had no choice.

I should have known he'd come
back for me. We were engaged.

Well, that just takes the cake.

No wonder I couldn't get
your phone number.

Your ex-boyfriend's
the Messiah.

It was Jo Lewis who said "you
can run but you can't hide".

He was talking about
another fighter.

It took 12 rounds, but he beat
the other fighter to a pulp.

His opponent didn't have the
opportunity I'm giving you.

I'm the only
way out of here.

And your last chance
to turn your life around.

Look at the people next to you.
They 're agents of the devil.

The lies they tell you
will damn them forever.

This is no freedom trail,
just a slow way to kill yourself.

Which if you ask me is truly
the greatest sin of all.

There's still time.

The world I promised you
still exists.

You just have to let
me take you there.

I love you, Tracy.

I'll see you real soon.

Alf a team, I can see the hotel.

Set up a perimeter on
the South West quadrant.

Copy that.

Bravo team, I have touchdown.
Commence sweep.

I need two guys round the back
and four guys round the front.

Keep it hot.

Who does he think he is?
Moses?

And Jesus, and Manson,
and Hitler all rolled into one.

If he thinks we're gonna wait
for him to exterminate us...

he's not the prophet
he thinks he is.

All he wants is me.
I can end this right now.

Oh no, you don't.
You're under arrest.

For accessory to that and
whatever else he does tonight.

We're taking you out of here.

Then we're taking him down.
Let's go.

We've covered the basement.
There's no way out down here.

.Then we'll move upstairs.
.Cameras, he'd spot us.

Not if he can't see.

Like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

This is Bravo division
repeating alert.

Squad leader, this is the chief.

S. W. entrance is secured.
N. W. entrance is still on hold.

Leader has entered the building.
Tangos have been spotted.

Ten, four.

Tell me this isn't happening.

Gamer, l want you
to tell me this isn't happening.

I'm sorry, the whole
building is down.

.Well, bring it up.
.It's gone off in the basement.

Not gone off.
Cut off.

Everyone to the basement
and don't let her get away.

Looking for me?

Come on.

We're playing by the rules.
Just how much time do you need?

Sorry to disappoint you.

Why are you always in the
middle of this crap?

What'd you do to this guy?

I've got something he wants.
Have you spoken to Maxwell?

.Is that the psycho's name?
.More on that later.

Take what he says to be true.
This whole place is wired.

We've dodged his bombs. I hope
you've got away out of here.

We've almost cleared a service
exit on the S. E. corner.

I was gonna send the SWAT team,
but If you can make it...

I'll pump the place with gas
and choke them.

.Fine. Wait for us.
Don't take too long.

.We'll see you on the outside.
.Roger that.

By the time Maxwell realizes
we're gone...

.he'll be sucking teargas fumes.
.What about her?

Jenna.
Oh, my God.

What's she doing here?

She was at home.
I said I'd call her tomorrow.

.Not soon enough.
.Do you know this girl?

.She's my daughter.
.This is Roger.

I can see you.
Just stay where you are.

Honey, everything's okay.
Just sit tight.

Gamer, what is going
on up there?

We need Maxwell here.
Then we get her and go.

Mr. Gamer can't come to phone
now, leave a message.

Well, what do you know.
You must be the Prince Charming.

I'm just doing my job. You're the
one living in a fantasy world.

But when I've erased all the
ignorant sinners like you...

my world will be the only one
standing.

As soon as you realize,
you'll do yourself a favor.

Hand the girl over.

You bring up some interesting
points but I'm gonna keep her.

Jenna,
stay right there.

What do you know about these?

Everything.

Don't.

It was one of ours.

And that?

.One of theirs.
.Come on.

There.

Honey.

.Don't you hang up on me again.
.I can explain everything.

You seem like a smart guy.

But you're out numbered and
running out of real estate.

Guys, can we do this later?

Dad!

.Come on.
.Come on.

Go, go.

Come here.

Iwas never really
good at Math. Let's go.

Come on, let's go.

Take this for me.
Thanks.

.Where are you?
.I ran into a road block.

Several, actually.
Kenny's daughter'swith us.

-What?
.It's a long story.

.We're not gonna make it to you.
.I knew you'd say that.

Team's on the way. We'll pick
you up at the front entrance.

There's a ventilation shaft
to the roof in the ballroom.

It's probably not booby trapped.
Chopper us out from there.

I said meet up with
S.W.A.T. team.

I ca n get us out of here.
.God damn it, that's an order.

And I expect you to follow it.
Now move out.

Quit whining.

.Isn't sorry enough?
.Talk is cheap, Dad.

.Hey!
.Sorry.

This way. Come on.

Let's go.

How many lives do you
have to ruin, Tracy?

You walk out with me
and everyone lives.

No disrespect, but is she
worth all this?

Loosing faith in my direction?

 .No ljust mean...
.Maybewe don't need her.

Maybe we don't need you.
Mention her again and I swear...

Come on.

Tracy, listen to me carefully.

I want you here now.

.Were you really engaged to him?
.I was young and he talk swell.

We were gonna
change the world.

.How did you end up in Vegas?
.It's the last place he'd look.

I could always sing.
Learn a few dance moves.

Show girl Tracy.

You could have picked Paris.

Meet any threat with
extreme prejudice.

-Rendez vous level.
-Affirmative.

.What's going on up there?
.We're taking fire.

Get up!
Let's go out of here.

It appears someone didn't pay
attention to my instructions.

Bravo, this is team leader.
Do you read me?

Bravo squad,
do you read me?

Talk to me.
What's going on there?

Talk to me.

.Ricky, the second project.
.Everything's ready to go.

Well done.

Your men are dead.

Did you think you'd get away
with astunt like that?

I gave you my word...

but people don't trust
each other nowadays.

Did you think I'd sit on my ass
and do nothing?

You're a police officer.
In this twisted society...

you get aspecial achievement
award for perverting justice...

and standing in the way
of decent human evolution.

In case you showed your true
colors I arranged a backup plan.

.What are you talking about?
.You won't get away with this.

To assume my powers are limited
would be making a big mistake.

I'm gonna teach everybody
in this town another lesson.

The Buddhists say we don't die.
We just cycle around.

Each life leading into the next.
Gathering knowledge.

So for all those
about to passon...

we shouldn't think
of it as an ending.

It's like I'm giving them
a seminar on life.

This is Alrborn 1, suspect has
just blown up the overpass.

Repeat suspect has blown up
the entire overpass.

What's going on out there?

He blew up the overpass.
It's a slaughter house.

.He blew the overpass!
.I'm giving him what he wants.

You don't understand.

This is all because of me.
I won't let anyone get hurt.

If we give in now,
he'll never stop.

Trust me on this.

Let's take one more chance.

.Can you get a helicopter?
.I'm calling the shots not you.

I can get us out of here.
Don't give up on us.

Okay.

Be there and I'll pick you up.

.Are yousure this is the way?
.Positive, right through here.

Everybody be careful.
Eyes open.

Damn, that was close.

.I could use a drink.
.Dad!

He's just kidding.
I think.

Let's get moving!
Back up!

Let's clear the way.
Bring the ambulance in.

Here we go.
We need help on this side.

.Where is everybody?
.Coming up right now.

Stop.

This way.

.Chief!
.Over this way.

Get down.

That's the part of"no"
you didn't understand.

Stay here.

She can't kill you.
She won't shoot.

It looks like you're running
out of believers.

Why don't you pack up
the arc and float away?

The flood is coming.
Right now.

Iwon't let you leave, Tracy.

You better believe that.

I'm getting sick of this guy.

Run, Maxwell.

Come on, Jenna.

Is he alright?

Is he alright, Roger?

Out.

In all his life time, Van Gogh
only sold one painting.

Galileo was jailed...

for saying that the earth
revolved around the sun.

I don't have to tell you what
they did to Christ.

Why is society
so afraid of greatness?

Why does it turn its back
on the ones it needs the most?

In the end these great men
are always sanctified.

But they always
have to die first.

I've set every bomb
to go off in ten minutes.

That's enough to bring this
place down before you get out.

It's enough time for you to
decide if I get to be a hero...

or do we all go out
as martyrs.

Go!

.We can still get out.
.We'll never make it.

.Kenny, you can disarm it.
.Not in 1O mins.

Let's just wait
for him to kill us.

There is one way.

Turning yourself over
is not the answer.

What if he just thinks I am?

What? Like a trap?

Like one last roll of the dice.

We are in Vegas.

Fine.

Let's go for it.

Okay, how do we do this?

Tracy?

It's me.

Are you willing to take me back
as if my thoughts were your own?

Yes, Maxwell.

.Then come back to me.
.Meet me in the Kings chambers.

.You sure you want to do this?
.More sure than I've ever been.

Keep his attention.
All I need is one good shot.

Listen to me.

You stay right here.
Promise me.

Promise me you'll stay here.

You two continue
to be a thorn in my side.

.What do we have here?
.I'm Jenna.

Jenna's a pretty name.
It's good to have an extra ace.

Tracy, you disappointed me.

What are they doing to you?

Daddy...

-Daddyl
.How did he find her?

.He's gonna get you.
.Be a good girl and come along.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

The King's chamber, Tracy.

You bastard!

Isn't it beautiful
when you can see the light?

Let her go.
I'm coming with you.

The Building is surrounded.
The police are waiting for you.

.And wait they will.
.Are you okay?

We're gonna slip out
right under their noses.

The basement.

I missed you.

Come on.
Let's go.

Are you alright?

Are you okay?

Let's go.

Maxwell, you sick freak!

Let's go! Let's go!

Time to go.

.Damn it! Where is she?
.King's chambers.

Oh, honey.

.Did he hurt you?
.I'm okay, but he took Tracy.

.Where did they go?
.They 're headed to the basement.

He said the hotel is
going to blow.

Not with us in it.
Let's play find the cult leader.

Come on.
Through here.

.What?
.A bomb!

.Leave it for the bomb squad.
.It's motion activated.

Can you do this?

Dad!

Let him go.

We're running out of time.

.Let's go.
.Come on, let's go.

Come on, let's go.

Listen up, everybody.

Today we lost one of the best
cops this city has ever known.

So this city is shut down until
we find the guy who did it.

Nothing moves in the air or on
the ground until Maxwell's ours.

Let's do this, people.

.You okay?
.I'm okay.

This is it, I've done enough
damage for one life time.

I'm glad to hear you
say that.

This is a special
news announcement.

Emergency crews are cleaning up
the Sandsof Time hotel.

Pollce are still looking
for the main suspect...

a radical cult leader
known only as Maxwell.

He is believed to be
in the area.

He's armed and may still have
one of the hostages.

Where are we going?

You'll see.

This is Alrborn 2.
we're tracking a suspect.

Driver and passenger
match the report.

Heading west on 75.

.Shit.
.The Hoover dam.

.I'm going after this guy.
.Your not doing this alone.

Stay here and start
the evacuation.

 Get me the governor's office.

This the L.V.P.D. requesting
a code red.

Evacuation of the dam.

Repeat, this is a code red.
This is not a drill.

Command acknowledges code
red, full evacuation is under way.

The perimeter is sealed off.
All roads are closed.

Up we come.

It's like being
on top of the world.

Please, I'll do
whatever you want.

This way.

Get me as close
to the dam as you can.

2 clicks over this ridge.

Right this way.

Let's go.

There's nothing to be scared of.

I saved you once from yourself
and I can do it again.

As soon as we blow the dam.

You said all you wanted
was for me to come with you.

Purified.
I'm purifying the future.

What'syour status?

The tourists are being evacuated
but no sign of Maxwell.

.Finish up this barricade.
.Let's get this rigged up.

Let's go.

.Oh, man.
.Look what he's doing.

.You don't know when to give up.
.I'm no good at taking orders.

A Greek warrior once said...

Sometimes from the
worst fortune...

you can create a stroke of luck.
That's where you come in.

You make the prize
more worth it.

Are you okay?

Oh my God!
Look.

He's dead.
It's all over.

It's all over.

Come on.

Feel me, Tracy.

.Run.
.Oh, my God!

168 people have perished
In the flood.

But due to the fast action
of Det.McDanlels...

Way to go, hero.
