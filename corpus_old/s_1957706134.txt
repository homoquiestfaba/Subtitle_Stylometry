(LuEllen laughing)

You must be tired after
that trip from New York.

Go on and shower, set
yourself up in Michael's room.

Then, maybe you could take
a look around town, okay?

(dramatic music)

That'll be a $1.69 son.

It's getting hot out there,
you're already getting shiny.

Well now Mr. Sequan,
what grade you say you in?

My old school
didn't have grades.

[Charity] Was it like
at retarded school?

Charity.

I'm sure we'll get
it all figured out.

You gonna be on the
same team with Michael.

Everybody round here is so
proud of Michael. (chuckles)

He is star forward on the
varsity basketball team.

Get a lot of scholarship
offers too.

But Ahmed is so much better.

That's 'cause
you sweet on him.



Ahmed can get through some
defense though, I tell you that.

You wanna make an
impression around here,

you best be able to get a
basketball through a hoop

or kick butt on the
football field.

[Charity] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

[LuEllen] What is it you do?

Write.

Well I'm sure Mike'll
be able to show you

some sports tips when
he get a chance.

(r & b music)

Keep your hands off my shit.

* Never thought

My crib, my rules, understand?

Look at me when I'm

[Class] I pledge

(students laughing)

We will continue

Men and Lord of the Flies.

So is that gun registered?

[Mr. Lemmings] Yes of course.

Don't count on me, I

[Sheriff] So what

[Mr. Lemmings] Do y'all
want to get to class please,

Mrs. Stewart, you sure
you didn't hear anything?

Sheriff King I, I just
drove Mr. Lemmings home.

(students chattering)

Thank you.

Who can give me
the title of a book

by Mr. William Faulkner?

Mr. Robins.

[Ahmed] Excuse me?

Ms. Anderson.

Mr. Greene, school
seems to think you ought

to be in 12th grade
English, how 'bout you?

Absalom, Absalom!

[Teacher] Very good.

As I Lay Dying.

Very good.

Light In August.

Very good.

But Mr. Faulkner, he
once told this reporter

that if there was ever a race
war, you know hypothetically,

that he wouldn't hesitate
going out into the street

and shooting Negroes
if he had to.

But James Baldwin, a
writer like Mr. Faulkner,

only he was black, he
said that Faulkner

represented the problem
with all liberal whites

and basically most white people.

Mr. Baldwin said that
they were so quick to talk

about honor and dignity, but
at the same time didn't see

the inherent dishonor and
indignity of legalized
oppression.

A little history
lesson from Dr. Greene.

Thank you very much.

(knocking on door)

Mr. Greene you have a visitor.

Mmm, uh you doing all right?

I mean everything
okay at LuEllen's?

It's all right.

That's good.

cell on the front there.

And I'm gonna put my
home number on the back.

If you can read that, it's
kind of chicken scratch

but my wife always makes it so.

So I'm gonna go.

good in this family.

The boy is hurt.

We don't need your help.

After they go out dancing

This Shawna is trying to

She is trying to
detox my swimmers.

(people laughing)

Okay, you know what I'm
saying, my swimmers boy.

(people laughing)

You know.

It is not all that funny,

It's funny enough but
I love you anyway.

Aww, I love you too.

So my man Quannie.

I hear that you won a
writing contest last year.

Yeah.

You what you should do, you
should show Shawna your work.

[Sequan] Oh really.

Mm-hmm(affirmative).
Why?

She's a big time
published writer boy.

For real?

I don't know about big time,

but I write children's books.

You ever heard of Little
Latisha Langston.

You write the Little
Latisha Langston books?

[Shawna] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

You BJ Putnam?

[Charles] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

He has heard of you,
you are big time.

Oh hush.

I used to babysit for
my next door neighbor,

he daughter had all your books.

Oh you must mean
literally, I haven't

sold that many. (chuckles)

Oh now you hush.

She's modest about her work,

but proud of this
food go figure.

(everyone laughing)

Calling her mother, telling
her how much weight I lost.

Look at me man, I'ma
buck 10 with silk

and wet with bricks
in my pocket.

(Shawna laughing)

So is it true, did you
really beat up my father?

Yeah I did.

I'm sorry 'bout that.

I don't even remember
him that much.

Well you know what, that's
probably for the best.

Your mother and I used
to be real tight.

She moved to New York
because I was up there.

I bet you didn't
know I named you.

Yeah, that's what gives me
the right to call you Quannie.

Yeah, about that.

[Charles] What
you don't like it.

Yeah, it's dope.

You damn right it is.

Uncle Charles.

Can I live with you and Shawna?

Sequan that's
kind of tough okay.

I'm kind of new here myself.

I got all this town business
and you know Shawna's

always on a deadline
or something.

LuEllen's good people.

Your mom wanted it that way.

So we'll do it for
your mother, hmm.

Happy to have you here though.

(somber music)

So what type of name
is Sequan anyway?

Muslim.

You're not Al-Qaeda are you?

No.

Are you Muslim?

No, nothing really.

Went to Catholic school,
ain't Catholic though.

Don't know any Muslims,
don't know any Catholics,

just regular old every
day Christians.

(somber music)

It was built a long time ago,

supposedly so they could
spot runaway slaves

trying to get out
across the river.

That's handy to know.

Oh and just so you know,
it's also a big makeout spot.

A makeout spot for
runaway slaves.

(both chuckle)

No.

Sometimes I think if I
jumped hard enough,

I could make it out
clear across that river.

Mm-hmm(affirmative).

(somber music)

Me and Med are
thinking 'bout eloping.

But we haven't told our
parents or anything yet.

Isn't that what eloping is.

All right, so
don't say anything.

I won't.

(Sequan coughing)
(Lori laughing)

Oh my God, what is this stuff?

It's what you call your
white lightening. (laughs)

Go Sequan, go Sequan. (laughs)

You like black dudes.

(Lori laughing)

I don't know, I guess.

Do you like black dudes?

Yeah, hells yes.

I love black dudes.

You're gay.

Yeah, I am.

What?

It's just, to hear
you admit that.

Even after they beat you up.

We don't get much of
that around here.

Nobody wants to stand
out for being different.

Oh my god, how'd she die?

It was a fire in the
building we lived in.

They used oil paint
in the hallways.

Smokes up and burns,
you can't breathe.

And she got caught.

Oh Jesus.

It was nothing I could do.

Even if I was there.

Shit, check and see if I have
any cancer sticks in there.

Thanks.

What'd you get?

Well nice, funny or scary?

Both.

Thanks, no one ever gave
me a book like this before.

I don't got nothing for you.

Hello, the tour.

See you around.

Bye.

Whoa, damn you boy.

Oh it figures.

Took me 35 years, 35
to get a membership

in this club and some kid
comes along and whips my ass.

[Charles] Sorry sir.

Hey no formalities needed
during morning tee time.

When are you gonna use the
name that my mama gave me?

Now you know just 'cause
they still doing the grass

don't mean that you
ain't still the mayor.

That's true, but call me Sam.

Yeah.

I told you campaign signs
were a waste of money.

You're running unopposed.

[Charles] I'm just
trying to do it right.

Nonsense son.

Sheriff Thompson
died, county council

named you interim sheriff.

That means that you're
sheriff until you die or quit.

Don't nobody want
to run for that.

Besides, they named
you for a reason.

They coulda gone with Lewis.

But Jefferson's a
black county now.

[Charles] Right.

About the school, I need
to talk to some students.

What, Lemmings giving
you a hard time.

Yeah.

I'll talk to him.

He owes me a few.

Thank you.

[Mayor] To Jefferson.

That is not a
book in your hands.

A boy gave it to me.

You know a boy who reads?

[Teacher] As we
look at these books,

we will explore mood,
tone, theme, and character.

And you will compare
and contrast

each of these
elements in an essay,

which will be used as
part of your final exam.

Let me see.

There's a grim secret
hidden in the fact

that so many people
won't halt the rescue.

Could not be rescued, but yet

a prisoner of their color
had become a hiding place.


What kind of faggot
nigga wrote this shit?

What, you want it?

Ahmed.


What the fuck, I'm getting
tired of your shit.

Bitch you want to die?

Don't you ever talk
to me like that.

(students in cafeteria talking)

(knocking on door)

Hi Lori, is everything
all right, is your mom okay?

Yeah Lu she's fine.

Is Sequan home?

[LuEllen] Sequan,
you have a visitor.

(somber music)
(loud sniffing)

* Riding folks around
just to find *

* They going just to con *

[Lori] You know
what time it is?

8:30.

Fuck it, come on let's go.

(fireworks exploding)

(people talking at carnival)

(bell ringing)

Winner number
four, the bear goes

to the big one right there.

(Sequan and Lori yelling)

(upbeat rock music)

(Sequan coughing)
(Lori laughing)

Hold it.

Okay, now let it go.

Yeah, good.

I think I'm feeling it.

(Lori laughing)

You think I'm pretty?

Yeah.

That's for you.

You're way too cool to be
one of my boyfriends anyway.

When was the first time you.

Please I've been
fucking since I was 13.

There's girls at home
pregnant at that age.

Not me, no way, I don't
never want to have no kids.

I mean, if I had me,
I wouldn't want me.

What's that?

This is for the
big girls sweetie.

Where the fuck were you?

You don't know how to
use the fucking phone?

Idiot.

Who are you?

Sequan, who are you?

Jake, I'm her brother.

What the hell were
you guys doing?

I wasn't doing anything.

That girl doesn't know
when enough is enough.

[Lori] Come on
couple of assholes.

[Jake] So you're the new guy?

[Sequan] No I'm
not the new guy,

we're just friends.

He's not any of that.

Why ask a stupid questions.

I need to lay down for a minute.

(body thudding)

[Jake] Why did you
let her do so much?

[Sequan] You're the
one who showed up late.

I hate it when
she's like this.

[Sequan] Can you drive?

[Jake] Not legally.

(loud crashing)

Come on give me a break
with that shit already.

So, you give Lori that book?

Yeah.

I like Baldwin too.

I do, I've been trying to get
her to read him for years.

Hell I've been trying to
get her to read anything.

What'd you say?

I didn't say anything,
I just gave her the book.

Damn it.

I'm sorry man.

Naw, I just never
thought of that.

(camera beeping)

So.

Well yeah, uh-huh.

I've been.

Right.

I love you baby.

Next time I'll let
you stick it in.

(boys laughing)

(boys groaning)

[Sequan] Get the
fuck off of me.

[Michael] Shut the fuck up.

(Michael groaning)

Fucker. (groaning)

Shut the fuck up bitch.

(Michael groaning)

Quit moving nigga.

Yeah, yeah boy.

(Sequan whimpering)

[Sequan] Get off of me!

Shut the fuck up,
get the fuck down.

[Shawna] When are
you coming to bed?

Soon.

Nothing huh?

Even if I had anything,
they wouldn't tell me.

You'll get it done.

They still have to
follow the law Charles.

You're the law.

And don't stay out
here all night

and let all this get cold now.

(phone ringing)

Aw Shawna.

Hello.

What?

Yes, where?

Who is this?

(leaves crunching)

Jesus.

[Charles] Go back
and get the kit.

[Lori] You got that
bum for me baby?

(laughs) Hell no.

You come back later.

But I just.

Hey, what the fuck I just say.

Come back later huh, I can't be

raising my voice
when my mama home.

But baby, I really need it.

I know you do.

Get that tricked ass
pussy out my house.

I don't understand.

Look Charles, son
you don't want

to go making these folks mad.

Now if they say it ain't their
kids, it ain't their kids.

Yeah but Sam.

And besides look,
you think that

they kids did something wrong?

You wouldn't do the right thing.

Come on now.

You're in my favorite spot.

Come on let's go.

(water splashing)

So, how come I ain't
seen you in school?

Oh I go to Saint John's
Christian Academy over in
Dillon.

And Lori goes to school here.

Yep, she's been kicked
out of every school,

public or private for 40 miles.

A few years ago she tried
to jump off that bridge

but it's not too high.

Everyone knows anyway.

See, in Jefferson,
people they like

to pretend they don't
know but they do.

It's called being proper.

Fuck proper.

Fuck proper.

(water splashing)

You swim?

No.

You Float?

* Take me to the water *

Oh I'm gonna drown.

* Take me to the water *

* Take me to the water *

* To be baptized *

* None but the righteous *

* None but the righteous *

* None but righteous *

* Shall see God yeah *

* So take me to the water *

* Take me to the water *

* Take me to the water *

* To be baptized *

* I'm going back home *

[Sequan] Michael's
been fucking me.

I don't get it.

He's been beating
me up and fucking me.

Why haven't you
told anyone Sequan?

I'm telling you.

Why didn't you say
anything to your uncle.

I can't do that.

He already hates me 'cause
I'm a faggot anyway.

You don't know that.

Goddamn, I miss my mom.

[Lori] We have got to get
the fuck out of this hell hole.

(doorbell ringing)

Sheriff King.

Mrs. Stewart, Mrs.
Stewart I need your help.

Listen I've told you
everything I know.

I know you did.

See the thing is, in
my experience sometimes

people who say the least
have the most to offer.

I really, I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

Sure you can and this
isn't about Lemmings,

this is about you.

And yet no one is gonna
care what you two are up to.

But I got a dead boy now.

[Mrs. Stewart] Oh I know.

I know Tim and I
know his parents.

You know his family.

You know that they're hurting.

And Mrs. Stewart they
just want the truth.

I think you know the truth.

I can't be no faggot.

Look,

you think I'd make it to
college ball if I was a faggot?

You think the NBA wants
faggots motherfucker?

You're the faggot.

You're my faggot.

Stay away from that white boy.

(knocking on door)

[LuEllen] What's
going on in here.

[Michael] Nothing Ma, what?

[LuEllen] Come out here
and wash these dishes.

[Michael] All right Ma.

[LuEllen] You boys
get ready for supper.

(somber music)

[Jake] Hey.

[Sequan] Hey.

How long you been waiting?

I don't know, didn't
really think about it.

I come up here all the time.

It's the one view of this town

that makes it seem
halfway decent.

Where do you think
we should go?

Anywhere's better than here.

My mom took me
to Florida once.

Disney World?

No, Miami.

We could go there.

Yeah, Miami could work.

(sirens wailing)

Sheriff King, it's much
too early for your nonsense.

Look, we're here to
search the lockers

of Ahmed Robins, Billy Wells,

Dwayne Cornelius, Lori
Anderson, and Michael Willis.

What, what, this is ... you
are not coming in my school.

You step aside or you're
going in for obstruction, Lewis.

[Lewis] I'm sorry
about this sir.

[Mr Lemmings]
Would you stop it.

Hey Ahmed, Ahmed,
Sheriff, Sheriff.

Damn-

Sheriff's looking
through our lockers Med.

[Ahmed] Let's go.

Shit, I, I.

(somber music)

Oh i came to you first,

All of this is on you.

Sheriff King, the town
council was very clear on this.

You are not to invade
our children's privacy.

My daughter.

Your daughter is already
been here Mrs. Anderson.

This is her locker.

Well you would do
well to leave right now.

Excuse me, but you would
do well to leave right now.

Principal Lemmings, are you

gonna let him get
away with this.

(Mrs. Stewart yelling)

(men yelling)

I got it Lewis.

You saw Tim break into your car,

you saw him arguing with Ahmed.

You stood there and you watched
them shoot at each other.

You watched them shoot at each
other and you did nothing.

You stay outta my way.

[Lori] Get in, hurry up.

Come on, hurry up.

Come on.

This next one belongs
to Michael Willis.

You better take a
look at this one.
