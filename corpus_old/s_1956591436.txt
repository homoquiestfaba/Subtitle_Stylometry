Hi.

How's, uh... Sorry.

How was school today?
Mm.

Wanna get some ice cream?

No.

Thanks.

All right.

(water dripping)

LUCY: <i>Well,
the azaleas look nice.</i>

DREW: <i>Well, I watered them
every day.</i>

Or I would have,
if I didn't forget.

Those are new.
I put 'em in yesterday.

(chuckles)
LUCY: I missed you.

Yeah?

Babe, you went to space.


It was...

I don't know.

It's hard to put into words.
I bet.

To be up there...

(Drew snoring)

DREW: Hey, sleepyhead.

How's rocket lag?

What time is it?

Where's... where's Iris?

DREW: 8:30. I already put her
on the bus.

Hey, can you...

(Lucy sighs)

I missed you.
(Lucy chuckles)

(Drew chuckles)
LUCY: What?

Mission accomplished.

WILL: <i>And you're settling
back in?</i>

LUCY: <i>Never settle.
My nana taught me that.</i>

WILL:
How are you feeling physically?

LUCY: I'm in top shape, sir.

WILL: After just a few days
in micro-gravity

your bone and muscle mass
begins to shrink dramatically.

You were up ten days.

I've seen men
carried off the shuttle,

too weak to stand.

LUCY: Well...

All right.

Top of your class,
naval academy.

Valedictorian,
high school and college.

Can you stop?

Stop what?

WILL: Working.
I'm taking a few days.

My niece is staying with us.
Blue Iris.

WILL: Blue Iris?

It was his second choice,
actually. My brother.

His wife talked him out
of Sanctuary Rose.

Annabelle,
she was the practical one.

Change a light bulb.
Remember to eat.

She's dead now.

Anyway...

Iris is staying with us,

and we've been doing
girl things.

WILL: Didn't I see you here
on the track yesterday,

and in the gym this morning?

LUCY: Bone density.
Muscle mass.

WILL: Throw a Frisbee.
Fly a kite.

(Lucy laughs)
WILL: What?

Nana says
Frisbees are for dogs.

WILL: Tell me about her.

Three guys chased my dad home
from school one day

with axe handles

and she put the first
warning shot in the dirt.

The first?
Lucy: Well, in San Angelo

a leg shot's considered
a warning.

Why'd they chase him?

Your dad.

LUCY: He pissed
in their gas tank.

You know Michael Collins?

Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Apollo 11.

He flew the command module
for Neil and Buzz.

WILL: Yeah.

So you know that
after he dropped them...

he circled the moon for hours.

It's farther from Earth
than any man has ever been.

<i>No light, no radio.</i>

And he wept,
consumed by darkness

and then,
when he saw the sun again...

he wept some more.

Inside the module he wrote...

"I am now truly alone...

and absolutely alone
from any known life.

I am it."

I'm fine.

<i>â™ª Shades of night are falling
as the wind begins to sigh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the world's silhouetted â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Gainst the sky â™ª</i>


(song continues on radio)


(door opens)

(door closes)

LUCY: There are better ways
to kill yourself

than smoking
with your oxygen machine.

How's that, fucker?

I'm back.

Ooh. Did you go somewhere?
Well, up, then down.


You show those
Ivy League assholes

how it's done?
Damn straight.

used to play golf.

Said it was good for business.

He was unemployed.

He was an idiot.

You here to make sure
I'm still breathing?

Drew said your disposal's out.

Oh.

That it is.

LUCY: <i>I'm supposed to be
on vacation.</i>

I've already color coded
three rooms in my house

and signed up
for neighborhood watch.

NANA: You should get a hobby,
like me.

(pouring liquid)
LUCY: Drinking's not a hobby.

the government says

I'm too old
to do it professionally.

LUCY: Fixed.

NANA: They givin' you a medal?

NASA? For what?

All I did was my job.

Good girl.
No special treatment.

Sebastian dropped Iris on us
again while I was in space.

Can you believe that?

Did you leave her in the car?

She's in school.

He called me from the road,
your brother.

Something about
power tool races

in San Francisco.

You know what I told him?
"Get a job."

LUCY: Oh, he has a job.

He writes poetry.

When's your next mission?

Polaris goes in a few weeks.

Orion is in 13 months.
That's my shot.

NANA: Well, you're not getting
any younger.

So, you're just gonna
have to work harder.


Suit circuit return valve.
Reverse O-two umbilicals. Check.


Flush PKG, screen
and honeycomb. Check.

(pants heavily)

ERIN: Watch it.

Relax. You'll run faster.

Loose, you know?

No hurry. Just let it go.

Keep up the good work!


(indistinct chatter)

JIM: Good morning.
ALL: Good morning.

JIM: Mm. I said good morning.

ALL: Good morning.
JIM: There you go.

If you are in this room
and you are wearing blue

you are a candidate
for the next Orion mission.

Mission parameters are fluid...

but for now...

let's plan on a two-week run.

We'll be installing
a starboard truss system

and a solar array pair.
I saw you on the track today.

ERIN: Mm-hmm.

LUCY: You need to keep
your head up.

JIM: Some of you
have taken this ride before.

Congratulations.

Now, the bad news.

If you wanna go again...

Thanks for the tip.

...you're gonna have to earn it.

And that's no joke.

Dismissed.

ERIN: You were
on the Destiny mission, right?

I was. Tell me your name again?
I'm Erin Eccles.

I just came over from the SAIL.
Wow.

So, do you have any pointers?
Other than keep my chin up.

Oh, that depends.
Are you a pilot?

I'm in robotics.

Well, scratch two seats
right there.

So, you want that seat
on Orion? You take it.

Just make sure to leave
one for me. All right?

Copy that.

(alarm blaring)

Still a lot of Christmas
up here.

JIM OVER RADIO: <i>Copy, Orion.</i>
O-two level's solid.

DFS restart indicated, Houston?

<i>Orion,</i> we confirm.
Hard restart.

O-two dropping. Venting fast.

MARK: Eccles?
Give me a second.

LUCY: We don't have
a second, rookie.



MAN OVER RADIO:
<i>Exiting atmosphere.</i>

<i>Prepare for final destination.</i>


(firecrackers crackling)

(sparkler crackles)

DREW: Y'all done burning down
the subdivision?

We're almost eating here.

IRIS: More?

Whoo!

You know, I was thinking.
One more mission.

What? I didn't say anything.
One more mission.

Then we should have a baby.

That's what
you were gonna say, right?

All right, who wants a hot dog,
and who wants a burger?

Form a single line, please.

<i>â™ª Three in the front seat
They sat on each side â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That green and white
'58 Fairlane â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It would glide down farm roads
and open fields â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Seeming like no big deal â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As it was happening
I never felt a thing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But now, looking back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It seems like
it was everything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Singing with Mom â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just so we could hear
ourselves sing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stealin' a drink â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From the cold can
in Daddy's lap â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Protected by only
a small thin brown paper sack â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the wind blew the echoes
of long-faded voices â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They would sing me a song... â™ª</i>

Pupil response normal.
Any headaches?

No.

DR. ADDISON: Nausea, diarrhea?
LUCY: <i>Negative.</i>

FRANK: <i>What she's asking is...</i>

how was it?

LUCY:
Mission accomplished, sir.

That's not what I asked.

Best two weeks of my life.

Boat ran like a clock.
Systems held up.

Crew were top-class.

So, you liked it?


Sir...

I never felt so alive.

<i>â™ª And with the windows wide open
It felt hot to us â™ª</i>

MARK: <i>Hey, Moonglow.</i>

I was just giving my ladies
a little tour here.

Chelsea, Emily,
this is Daddy's friend, Lucy.

Lucy was just in space
last week.

Maybe y'all have some questions
for her?

Um...

Where'd you get that brownie?

(Lucy chuckles)

Over there.
And they're very good.

Yeah, okay. Here. Go.

Don't tell your mother
I gave you that.

Separated. It's a lot of work.

Well, they seem like great kids.

They are.

Hey, you bowl?

What?
Bowling.

Indigenous cultural praxis
of the North Americas.

Promotes social cohesion
through, I don't know...

pointless competition,
alcohol abuse,

and shared footwear, I guess.

With you and the girls?

No. The club.
You're a member now.

What club?
MARK: Hey.

Are y'all gonna roll tonight?

Yeah.
Uh, no.

Yeah.
For sure not.

You're going.
Won't be there.

We're going. She's going.

What club?

The most elite group
of people ever formed

in the history of mankind.
A secret society

where every single member
has seen the face of God.

The one... the only...

Circle of the Rolling Ball.

Well, fun as that sounds...

I'm not really a joiner.

And my husband...

Yeah, we've got my niece
staying with us, so...

Earth families.

You got a new family now.

<i>Semper volvens.</i>

You want me to say that
to my husband? That bad Latin?

No. Just tell him
you're training.

That's what the rest of us do.

Sugarland Lanes, eight o'clock.
Ask for Wernher von Braun.

(Lucy chuckles)
Hey, girls, let's go.

Let's see if we can eat those
things ridin' a centrifuge.

Say bye.

BOTH: Bye.
Come on.

See you tonight.
Where's the change?

Training? What training?

You're not supposed
to be back yet.

LUCY: <i>I know.
I told them. But...</i>

<i>It's really simple stuff.
More of a debrief, really.</i>

IRIS: Tell her I'm injured.

I won't be home late.

DREW: <i>Well, if it's good
for NASA,</i>

<i>I guess it's a win for me, too.</i>
That's the spirit.

DREW: <i>Love you.</i>
You too.


LUCY: Is that me?
MARK: Yes, it's you.

Let's see what you got, girl.
LUCY: Oh, all right.

MARK: Show us what you got.

(Lucy clears throat)

JIM: There you go.

LUCY: Whoa.

LUCY: Darn it!
Trajectory apex error.

LUCY: All right.
I like a challenge.

Make it a little fairer
on y'all.

MARK: All right. Listen. May I?

It depends. You got any idea

what you're talking about?
I do. My great-grandfather

actually invented this game,
so, come on.

Look. Here.

Thank you.
Secret is...

do, like, a little twist
at the end.

'Cause yours is goin' that way.
Little twist?

Yeah. A little...
He coach you all like this?

That the secret of this club?

We ask him not to.
It gets weird.

Yeah. Help us. Can you?

JIM: The secret is
he's hammered.

JIM: That's not a secret at all.

Let's go. I wanna see this.
Just follow through.

Feel it, all right.
Let's go, come on.

All right, I'ma watch.

MARK: Look at this! Hey-o!
(thuds)

(Lucy exclaims)

MARK: I mean, not for nothing.

That's what you get.
All student, no teacher.

MARK: Really?
Mm-hmm.

(both laugh)

MARK: First of all,
that sounds... That's adorable.

JIM: (chuckles) That's true.
KATE: I know.

JIM: But, of course,
that's all we compare to.

KATE: So, how you been doing
since you've been back?

JIM: Tongue still feel weird?

Yes. What is that?
KATE: No one knows.

They think the brain adjusts
to speaking in zero G.

It'll be gone in about a week.

I'm great. Pretty great.

I'm just a little bit...

I don't know. You know?

KATE: Say no more.
JIM: We've all been there.

KATE: Yeah.
Been where? What did I say?

I don't know, but...
you said it.

LUCY: That's...

Just feel a little off.
No, not off. It's more...

You know how it is.
You go up there, you see...

Everything.
LUCY: The whole universe.

KATE: Yeah.

And everything here looks...

so small.

We're so small.

And then you splashdown.
What? You go to Applebee's?

You got Monday Night Football?
Clip your toenails?

And all you can think
about is...

JIM: When can I go back?

MARK: As requested...

five whiskeys.

JIM: Uh, there's four of us,
professor.

How could that possibly
have happened?

Must've been a rounding error.
Must've been a rounding error.

(all laugh)

That's why he likes you so much.
You laugh at his old jokes.

KATE: And they are old.
JIM: Does he have any other?

(Jim sighs)

<i>â™ª Folding my hand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm folding my hand â™ª</i>

(car engine stops)

(car door opens and closes)

(Mark clears throat)

Hold on, hold on,
hold on, now. Come on.

LUCY: Oh. And a gentleman.
MARK: Yes, ma'am. Of course.

LUCY: Ooh!
MARK: Take it easy now, easy.

Still finding those
Earth legs, huh?

LUCY: Or just drunk.
(Mark chuckles)

(Lucy sighs)

MARK: You're home.

That's good.
I know. Of course.

It's just...
(clears throat)

Never mind.

Thanks.

That was...

I needed that.

MARK: See you on deck, sailor.

Don't go fallin' off
those shoes.

(Lucy chuckles)

(car engine starts)

(music playing over speakers)

LUCY: Hey.
DREW: Oh, hey.

Better already, huh?

LUCY: Well, if you say so.

Is she, uh...
Asleep, I think.

How was training?

Oh, you know.
It wasn't really anything.

Are you drunk?
No.

I'm a little.

Some of the... Kate and the guys
we went out for a beer after.

Well, good. Good.

You need to blow off some steam.

Wow.

I'm gonna...

You, do you wanna...

Yeah, sure. Yeah. I...

Let me just...
let me just clean up here.

LUCY: <i>Suit circuit return valve.

MAYER: All the other crews

Are you kidding me?

Gotta love a checklist.
Maybe they're just lazy.

(Earl laughing)

(indistinct announcements
over PA)

(claps, chuckles)



Hi.

What you doing for lunch?

Uh. Wow.

Well...

I brought a sack lunch.

Now, I know it's...

late notice but I could see
if the maÃ®tre d' can find us

a table for two somewhere.

Uh...

Sure, sure. All right.

MARK: All right.


LUCY: You do this every day?

MARK: Not every day.
I <i>do</i> do work.

LUCY: I'm not sure about that.
You know, right?

I do.
LUCY: I question.

(both laughing)

MARK: Okay.

LUCY: Your kids seem cool.

MARK: Thank you.
Yeah, they're all right.

I mean,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

But things did get...

Things were different after I...

came back.

Marriage-wise.

Tricky.

I saw my house from space.

Not literally.
But... my life.

Drunk mother, deadbeat father.

Grow up. Join the navy.

Marry the nicest guy
you can find.

Well, he is nice.

(car honks)
Oh!

are you doin'?

What? What?
What's wrong with you?

What? It's like... it's like
we're back in high school

smoking under the bleachers.
(mark laughs)

Oh, come on, now.

No, you never smoked anything
under any bleachers.

LUCY: Says you.

Look at you. Straight arrow.

You've never done
a thing wrong in your life.

I've done plenty
of things wrong.

MARK: Mm. Yeah.

I bet you never even came
in second in anything.

Look, Mr. Know-it-all...
(Mark sniffles)

I've done lots of tawdry shit,
I'm here to tell you.

Really?
Yeah.

Hit me.


Yeah.


Okey-dokey.

LUCY: Hey.

IRIS: Nana's here.

LUCY: Here?

LUCY: Hey.
DREW: Oh, hi.

This fucker says
I can't smoke in the house.

DREW: That's me.

Apparently, you invited
your grandmother to dinner.

Oh, shit. Yes, I did.

I'm so sorry.

NANA: Yeah.
You look good.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm going outside to smoke,
like a hobo.

Oh. Be a doll, will you?

I left 'em in my purse
in the hall.

LUCY: Oh. Of course.

NANA: <i>Somethin' fall on you,
or are you coming back?</i>

LUCY: Comin'.
(door opens)

It's... it's dinner.
Okay.

DREW: Hey.
IRIS: Hey.

DREW: Wanna help set the table?
IRIS: Sure.

Smells good.
DREW: Thank you.

NANA: Thank you.

So, what's the scoop?

No scoop.
Just school in the summer.

Summer school.
Hey, how was work today?

Oh, you know, same old.
NANA: Where's your dad?

IRIS: Who knows?
NANA: I wish I could tell ya

that when he was a baby

I dropped him
on his head a lot, but...

fact is, some people
are just born lazy.

You keep your eye on this one.
She'll show you how it's done.

You hear me?
Yes, ma'am.

Okay, here goes the hobo.

DREW: Lord, for family,
and health, and wealth,

and all good things.

For the wonderful food
before us,

we wanna thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

For those who prepared it...

and, Lord, as we share it,

we ask that you stay with us
and be our guest of honor.

In Jesus' name. Amen.

IRIS: Amen.
NANA: Amen.

Hon?

Amen.

Who wants salad? Nana?

NANA: No, no. Thank you.

Would you?

LUCY: Up here.

What...

Don't fall.
LUCY: Oh, come on.

I've been up
a lot higher than this.

(Drew chuckles)

Did you sleep?
LUCY: I don't know.

Maybe.

We forget...

this happens.

Every day, twice a day.

The planet, our planet,
goes around the Sun.

Can you feel it?

We're moving.

It's all moving.

Giant objects in space,
millions of miles apart.

And we forget.

I mean, how is that possible?

We get busy.

We forget to look up.

When you're up there
on the station...

the sun rises every 90 minutes.

This happens once an hour.
(chuckles) God.

LUCY: Is that what it is?

I don't know.

You know why I pray?

See, my wife straps herself
to a giant bomb...

so she can leave the planet

and go to a place with no air
or water.

And I want her to come home.

So, I pray.
I'm home.

No, I don't think you are.

Hi.
Eight and a half minutes.

It's a new record.

(indistinct chattering)

If they're west...

Cola, suit up.

LUCY: Hey.

Yep, getting wet in here.

JIM: <i>Dive scrub. Dive scrub.
Get her out of there.</i>

DIVER 2: <i>Copy.</i>
JIM: <i>Walk away, Lucy.</i>

<i>That's an order.</i>
LUCY: Negative.

LUCY: Pressure's gone.
I'm under.

DIVER 3: <i>Here we go.</i>

<i>She's refusing to let go.</i>

DREW: Lord, for family,
health, and wealth,

DIVER 3: <i>She's let go.
We're on our way.</i>

RAUL: <i>Medical team standing by.</i>

WILL: <i>"I am now truly alone...</i>

Get her out! Come on!
Get her out!

Now!


JIM: Get the latch off.

Come on.

Get the latch.
Get air in there, diver.

Come on!

Come on. Get the latch!
Come on!

(Lucy breathes heavily)


MARK: Oh, my.

(muffled music playing

LUCY: Oh.

Oh, hey, did your suit fill up

No. Just my helmet.

Some people are sleepers.

All they do is dream.

He was always like this,
your dad.

Gettin' lost, forgetting things.

Me.

Nana would be at work,
and he'd be in charge...

but I'd be the one putting out
the toaster fire

and making sure that
he was brushin' his teeth.

I was nine. He was 15.

They can do that, boys.

They make the mess.
We're the ones who clean it up.

It's not fair.

Oh, no. It's not.

But we can do...

something they can't.

What?

Change.

(indistinct announcements
over PA)

Check out this footage.

She held her breath upside down
for over two minutes.

Heart rate never went above
a 100.

The whole time.

In fact, the longer it went,
the calmer she got.

And she finished the job.

LUCY: <i>Hi. We have
a reservation. Cola, two.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Of course.
Right this way.</i>

Could we start with a bottle
of white wine. Something dry?

WOMAN: Sure.
Thank you.

Well, this is nice. Hmm?

Is that?
It is.

Well, should we?
No.

No. She's...

I'm sure she's fine. Don't.
DREW: I'm just gonna...

(Lucy clears throat)
Hi, I'm Drew.

Uh, I'm meeting someone.
(chuckles) Oh, no.

I'm Lucy Cola's husband.
I work for NASA PR.

Drew Cola.
ERIN: Oh. Hey.

DREW: You know,
we were wondering if you might join us.

Oh. Um...

Thank you.

ERIN: I am actually
meeting someone.

Well, just until they get here.

Just a drink, come on.
We're family.

Okay. Okay.
Great.

ERIN: Hi.
LUCY: It wasn't my idea.

(all laughing)

Cheers.
Cheers.

DREW: <i>Well, your personnel file
says you grew up in India.</i>

Oh, you read my personnel file?
Well, that's my job.

If I don't know you,
I can't promote you.

My mom, she was a diplomat.

And so we lived in New Delhi
for a few years.

And then we lived in London.

Then we moved to Germany
for high school.

(speaks German)

Oh! (chuckles)

(speaks German)

No? Okay.

DREW: Mm.

And you went to MIT.

ERIN: Yeah. I...

Is this a job interview?
(Drew chuckles)

Um. Why don't you guys tell me
something about you?

How long have you been married?

Well, it'll be six years
next month.

I was in the navy.
I got recruited by NASA.

And then we met
in the cafeteria.

ERIN: Romantic.

Yeah. She helped me open
a bottle of ketchup.

I have weak hands.
(Eric chuckles)

ERIN: I had a boyfriend
in Boston,

but he was competitive. And...

I don't lose, so...

Didn't work out. (chuckles)

DREW: Mark! Hey, Mark!

Over here. (chuckles)

Well, what are the odds?


DREW: Yeah. Well, we came
for dinner and we saw Erin

and she's waiting for somebody.
Yeah. Me, actually.

I figured I'd take the kid out,
give her some pointers.

Don't fly into the sun,
that kind of thing.

We're not supposed
to fraternize.

MARK: Well, that's a big word.
Outside of work.

ERIN: Oh, this is just
a professional...

MARK: Mentoring.
ERIN: Yeah.

MARK: You might say. Yeah? You're
not gonna tell on me, are you, Drew?

DREW: No. Won't say a word.
Now, why don't you sit?

I'll get another glass for you.
MARK: Oh! You know what? Uh,

on my way over here,
my ex called,

and I have to pick up my kids.

I'm sorry.
I would've called you,

but I don't have your number.

ERIN: Oh, yeah. No, sure,
you should go do that.

Crazy, runnin' into y'all
like this. Wow.

We'll make some time up...
Yeah.

...at the ranch, right? Uh...

I'll see you.
DREW: Well, good seeing you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, I am starving.
Should we order?

LUCY: <i>Clip receptacle assembly

That was odd, huh?
LUCY: <i>Reverse O-two umbilicals.</i>

<i>Check.</i>
You think those two...

LUCY: <i>Suit circuit return valve.
Check.</i>

I mean, I hear things, you know?

LUCY: <i>Reverse O-two umbilicals.</i>

About him.
LUCY: <i>Check.</i>

Not that you...

LUCY: <i>Clip receptacle assembly

A bit of a ladies' man is all.

I mean, well, look at him.

LUCY: <i>Flush PKG, screen
and honeycomb. Check.</i>

DREW: Plus, he was in space.

I was in space.

Yeah, but...
you're stuck with me.

Meanwhile,
he's a divorced action figure

who likes to go fast.

She should be careful.

Hey. Not here.

We have been slippin'.

It's fine. It's fine.

We can go to my place.

(Mark grunts)

So, you're a mentor now.

With Erin.
Well, yeah. You know me.

I like to give the kids
a head start.

Oh, is that what we're doing?

Well, I don't know.
I wouldn't exactly

call you a kid.

I got a little jealous.
Seeing you and her.

Did you now?

Well, how do you think I feel?

Mr. Perma-smile.

I'll drink to that.

No more booze

You wanna say goodbye together?

You fucking her?

You gonna leave your husband?

Do you want me to?

Don't.
What?

Don't trust it.

That feeling. It's not real.

I love you.
I love you, too. Sure.

But can you tell me one thing
that is different

about the world because you
and I have a feeling?

Everything's different.
Well, yeah.

To you. In your head.

Sunrise at a different time?
Weather patterns shifted?

It's cortisol, oxytocin,
dopamine. It's a trick.

It's like believing in God.

What's happening right now?

You went to space...

and you saw the vast...

celestial everything
and it blew your fucking mind.

So now nothing
makes sense anymore.

But good old brain...

Well, brain doesn't know

that you're having
an existential crisis.

Brain just knows
that when we fuck...

it feels good.

So, you focus on that.

That feeling.

Because it seems real.

Well, that's cold.

All right, old boy.
I'll see you on the other side.

Hey. Need me to drive you home?

No.

I wanna feel the feeling.

She's fast asleep.

Listen.
What?

Listen, work got a little harder
than I thought, and...

it's been a rough
couple of weeks, you know.

When I called the Center...

they said you left early.

Nana's in the hospital.

What?

What? How?

She had a stroke. I've been
trying to call you for hours.

Wait... Can I see her?
I'll take you in the morning.

Is she okay?
Visiting hours from ten.

I can take you over there.
Just tell me she's okay.

Well, she hasn't woken up.

If you're here, I can take you

What?

What?

The glove compartment
in your car was locked.

I didn't know why, so I got
the key and I unlocked it.

How? Wait.

You got the key?
That's not the point. The point is

you're driving around with a
loaded gun in your car, Lucy.

So I need to know why?

You're acting so strange.

I never know where you'll be.
What time you're coming home.

And now with your Nana in the hospital...
You got the key

off my key ring?
A gun in your car, Lucy.

Why would you do that?
For fuck's sake, Lucy!

Why is there a fucking gun
in your car?

I had to put it someplace safe.

It's Nana's.

I found it in her purse
when she came to dinner.

And I didn't want her
walking around with it.

Well, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask?

What'd you think I was doing?

Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

Let's go outside.
Let's go outside.

Just need a minute.

I know. It's all right.

I loved her, too.
But she's in a better place.

Why would God make something

What?

I'm leaving.

I don't know when I'll be back.

Or if I'll be back. Uh...

I don't know anything anymore.

What's up?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Babe? You're upset.

You go to bed.

I meant space.

Just go to bed.

You must feel good.

I've been reviewing
the mission specs for Orion.

I'm so sorry
about your grandmother.

It's not an issue, sir.
I won't miss any training.

Dr. Plimpton says you skipped
your last three sessions.

LUCY: That's, uh... (chuckles)
I'm fine, really. I just...

I thought my time would be
better spent, you know...

Lucy. You had a helmet breach.

Your hat filled with water,
and you were without oxygen

for two minutes.

But I finished the job.

FRANK: That's not the...

If that happened up there,
you'd be dead.

Do you understand?

And maybe we lose another
astronaut trying to save you.

That's... Um... Sir. (inhales)

I'm giving everything
to this program, to the mission.

Believe me. You can't just...

I need to get back up there.
I mean, I want to go back.

To serve you. NASA. My country.

I'm pulling you out
of the running for Orion.

No.
Excuse me?


Sir, please.

I was born to do this.

It's all I have.

FRANK: I'll make sure you're in the
running for Polaris three years out.

But for now, I want you
to take a little time.

Find some distance.

Focus on training
the new recruits.

Work with engineers
on system upgrades.

Hey.
You're a real astronaut, Lucy.

A heavyweight.

You just let yourself get
too emotional.

This is not a drill, cadet.
Grab your stuff.

What are we doing?
Training exercise.

I'm the team leader.
You're the mission specialist.

What does that mean?

LUCY: In or out?
Is this legal?

Get the door.

(door closes)

Let me give you a heads-up,
all right?

One day, you're gonna be
working your hardest...

going toe-to-toe, contender.

Some man is gonna tell you
you're too emotional.

You're gonna think,
"What does that even mean?

I have feelings, sure.

I know, maybe I'm sad
or pissed, but I'm not that,

I'm not too emotional.

I'm, you know,
regular emotional."

And you know what
he's really saying is,

you are a...

(keyboard clacking)

All right.

MARK: <i>Hey, space girl.</i>

<i>You were unbelievable
last night.</i>

<i>When I get back,
I'm taking you to San Diego.</i>

<i>We'll go Saturday.
I already booked the flight.</i>

Can we go now?
Huh?

MARK: <i>Frank, it kills me
to say it, but...</i>

<i>our girl has been
pretty inconsistent recently.</i>

<i>Erratic.</i>

<i>She's a tough cookie, but...</i>

<i>hell, it isn't easy
to do what we do.</i>

<i>Not everyone
can handle the ride.</i>

<i>Maybe a break would do her good.</i>

(tires screech)

(indistinct chatter)

LUCY: All right.
IRIS: Whose house is this?

Oh. There you go. Fuel up.
I'll be back.

Lucy. Hi.
Hey, did you, uh...

Is Mark here?

Oh, I mean, I hope so.
It's his party, right?

Hey, listen. Are you okay?
I heard about Paxton.

Oh, I'm fine. I'm good.
All systems go.

Okay. You're not mad at me?
Why would I be mad at you?

The list.

Oh, you don't know?

They picked the Orion crew.
I'm going.

Um... listen, you know, I just...
I really thank you for...

when you walked out
on me that day. Because,

I don't know, you telling me
that I need to do it on my own...

I have to find Mark.

There he is.

Hey. Hey!

Whoa! Hi.
Glad to be back?

Yeah. I sure am.
Hey.

Um. We should get you
a drink, huh?

Hey, Kate, watch the thing.
Make sure nothing burns here

for me, okay? Hey.

Is, uh, Drew here?
Who?

Your husband?
Oh, I left him. Hi!

What? Hey, come on.
Are you... What?

Hey, Lucy.

I know about Erin.

I read your e-mails
when you were in space.

I broke into your office.

You broke into my office?
He grounded me.

Yes. I know he did.
Paxton.

I heard about it right before
I went up. I'm sorry.

What am I gonna do? Orion.
You have to talk to him.

Lucy, I need you to listen
to me, okay?

Take a deep breath.

You're having a panic attack.

It's not that big a deal, okay?
I... I get them all the time.

No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

He just... he grounded me
for no fucking reason.

And you gotta talk to him.
I will. All right, Lucy.

But for right now, I want you
to get some rest, okay?

You are spiraling.
You need to shut your brain off.

God. Go for a run or something.

A run? A run?

Lucy.

Is there anybody that you
can talk to? A doctor, maybe?

It's too bad we never got
that weekend away.

Just you and me.

Where'd you wanna go again?

San Diego?

Lucy.
Listen.

I know what you're doing.
You and her.

But you're gonna lose.

You're gonna lose,
because I'm a winner.

Hey, Iris. Come on.

IRIS: Hey.
Can I get a soda, at least?

(insects buzzing)

Iris, sweetie. I gotta go.

IRIS: What?
There's a mission.

I'm on a mission.

It's just a couple of days.
You'll be fine.

So, you're just gonna
leave me here?

There's food, I think.

You can order in.
I'll give you a card.

Or Drew, call Drew. He'll come.

No.
You can't just leave me here.

I chose you.
I came here with you.

She said,
"Keep your eye on that one."

She said. So I did. I am.

And you don't get to just
drive away.

It could be dangerous.

Good.

Get dressed.

Go.

Paper or plastic?
What?

The bag.
You want paper or plastic?

Plastic. No, no, paper.

No, no, wait.

What's the tensile strength
of both bags, approximately?

What?

You know, fuck it. Double it up.
Paper in plastic.

What? It's a road trip.

LUCY: Oh.

All right.

Write this down.

Houston to San Diego.
(dial tone ringing)

FRANK OVER VOICEMAIL:
<i>You've reached Frank Paxton.</i>

<i>Leave a message.</i>
(line beeps)

LUCY: Sir.

I won't lie. Being up there,
the experience...

I wasn't ready. I... I was ready
for the job. I did the job.

But the experience...

One thousand four hundred
and sixty miles

at 70 miles per hour
equals 20.9 hours.

Assuming 2.5 stops to refuel,
maximum nine minutes per stop.

Now, synchronize watches.

Flight arrival time
is 1900 hours tomorrow.

Requiring
a hard departure time of...

2000 hours tonight.

Current time is 18:16.

ETA to departure is one hour
and 44 minutes from...

now.

I don't have a watch.

Just get in the car.

Here's one.

In what way is your life
like a pregnant teenager?

Not now.

You can't unfuck
a pregnant teenager.


All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mrs. Know-it-all.

Well, I know things.
I know things.

He's gonna see reason.

He's a reasonable person.
Paxton. He's gonna see reason.

I think all this astronaut dick
has made you soft.

Oh, I'm soft?
Mm-hmm.

I'm soft?

I took eight G's
and didn't even blink.

How many G's can you take?

Oh, that's right, none.
Because you're fucking dead.

What are you doing?

I'm on a rescue mission.
Low Earth orbit.

Somebody got left behind
up there.

Who?

Me!

LUCY OVER PHONE: <i>Sir.</i>

<i>I won't lie. Being up there,
the experience...</i>

<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

<i>I mean, I... I was ready
for the job. I did the job.</i>

<i>But the experience...</i>

<i>But I get it now.</i>

<i>It's not just a job, sir.
I, uh... I thought it was.</i>

<i>But then I went, and now I know.</i>

It's a purpose.

It's my purpose.

<i>You know sometimes
on the old Apollo missions...</i>

<i>the bird would just, you know,
get off course. Just a little.</i>

And you'd need to bring
thrusters online

just to get her back on track.

You know,
give her a little push.

That's all I needed, a nudge.

You know,
just course correction.

And you wouldn't do that for me.

And now I have
to do it for myself.

(line disconnects)

Where is she?

(tires screech)
(horns honking)

Contact.
(music playing over car radio)

(fuel machine beeps)


Stage one. Complete.


(trunk closes)

Buckle up. We're running behind.

(thunder rumbling)

All right. You stay here.
Keep the car running.

We could be coming back hot.
"We"?

Where is the...

You okay?

What are you looking for?

Shit.

Shit, shit, shit.

Shit.

For the benefit of all mankind.
What?

For the benefit...

of all mankind.
(breathes heavily)

(dramatic music playing)

MAN OVER PA: <i>This is the final boarding
call for Flight 433 to Seattle.</i>

<i>At this time,
all ticketed passengers</i>

<i>should be aboard.
The final boarding call</i>

<i>for Flight 433 to Seattle.</i>

It's official. They lost my bag.

You got to be kidding me.

Yeah.
I have to go to the office.

No.
Yeah.

(both chuckles)

Well, I'll tell you what.
I will go get

the rental car then. Okay?
Yeah.

Yeah.

I'll see you there.
Yeah.

WOMAN OVER PA: <i>Passengers

MARK: Jesus.
We need to talk.

Lucy?
It's not a club.

Jesus. You scared
the living shit out of me.

It's not.

Look.

You cannot be here.

You said it was a club.
That I was in the club.

And other lies.

Look, I didn't...

Lucy, you are a grown woman.
With a husband, I might add.

So this... this... Don't do this.
Nothing matters.

Nothing matters.
That's what you said.

That's what you said.

You said that. We're just atoms.

But it does matter.
And now I'm left with what?

MARK: Hey, hey, hey.
Nothing.

Hey.
(Lucy sobs)

Why don't I... All right, look.

Why don't I call you
in a couple days

and we can just talk, all right?

Listen, look. I'm coming out.
Lucy?

MARK: Oh. Perfect.
Now it's a complete shit show.

What is she doing here?
Well, if I said I could explain...

Hey!
You're making a mistake.

He's not Einstein.
You're Einstein.

But they don't let you.
They don't.

And we have to stick together.
What in the fuck is going on?

(groans)
Oh, God.

MARK: Dang! Shit!

(Mark groans)
(engine revs)

(tires screech)

ERIN: Mark? Mark!

Mark? Mark?

Mark!

Listen to me.
What are you...

Listen. We don't have much time.

All right. Listen.

Sometimes there's wasps. Okay?

Okay.
You think it's a butterfly...

but then it's wasps.

And I know he told you
that you're part of club...

that you're in the club now.
Lucy, calm down.

But what did he make you give?
Your body. Right?

And then, you make a mistake,
not even a mistake.

You just take a risk
that they don't like.

ERIN: Yeah.
And suddenly, it's what club?

And you have nothing.

All right, it's a trap.
It's a trap.

So, I came here to warn you.

We have to do better.
ERIN: Okay.

We have to be better.
Or they win.

Okay.
IRIS: Lucy.

Never surrender.

IRIS: The Summer Day,
by Mary Oliver.

Who made the world?

Who made the swan,
and the black bear?

Who made the grasshopper?

<i>This grasshopper, I mean.</i>

<i>The one who has flung herself
out of the grass...</i>

<i>the one who is eating sugar
out of my hand.</i>

(bees buzzing)

<i>Who is moving her jaws
back and forth</i>

<i>instead of up and down.</i>

<i>Who is gazing around with her
enormous and complicated eyes.</i>

<i>Now she lifts her pale forearms
and thoroughly washes her face.</i>

<i>Now she snaps her wings open,
and floats away.</i>

I don't know exactly
what a prayer is.

<i>I do know
how to pay attention...</i>

<i>how to fall down
into the grass...</i>

<i>how to kneel down in the grass.</i>

<i>How to be idle and blessed...</i>

<i>how to stroll
through the fields...</i>

<i>which is what I have been doing
all day.</i>

Tell me, what else
should I have done?

Doesn't everything die
at last, and too soon?

<i>Tell me...</i>

<i>what is it you plan to do</i>

<i>with your one wild
and precious life?</i>

(indistinct radio chatter)
