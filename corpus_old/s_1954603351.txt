[Women chatting in background]

CAKE

<i>[Annette] Okay.</i>

<i>I think we need some closure...</i>

with what happened to Nina last month.

<i>Because we all cared so much for her.</i>

<i>It's going to be hard, but I am going to
sit here and pretend to be Nina.</i>

And as you feel... led...

I want you to verbalize, to me, to Nina...

how her suicide affected you.

Okay?


Okay.

[Exhales big breath]

<i>[Gail] I just wanna say... to you, Nina...</i>

that I don't understand how you
could give up.

I'm sorry, Gail. Can you forgive me?

<i>[Gail] What about your son?</i>

He doesn't have a mother anymore.

Why the hell didn't you reach out
for help?!

You could have called any one of us.
We'd have been there.

Will you forgive me?

What about you, Claire?

What about me?
Would you like to say something to Nina?

No.

You know, it might make you feel better
to get in touch with your feelings.

Okay in that case, I do have a question.

Go ahead.

You jumped off the freeway
overpass, right?

Specifically where the 110 meets the 105.

Yes... but...

And is it true that she landed
on a flatbed truck...

that was full of used furniture that
was heading to Mexico?

<i>[Annette] Claire, we should be focusing
on our feelings.</i>

And that no one discovered the
body until...

it reached Acapulco, that's more than
2,000 miles away.

[Group member groans] Oh God.

And that they then sent the body back in
a rubbermaid cooler...

which then got stuck in customs...

for like a week before Nina's husband
could even claim it.

Way to go Nina!

Personally I hate it when suicides make
it easy on survivors.

But please, continue.

[One group member sobbing]

Here you go. Thanks. Keep all that.

Okay.


[Silvana in Spanish accent] I make a dinner.
I don't wanna eat. I'm not hungry.

You must to eat. Doctor says.
Quesadilla.

What the hell is this?
Yeah.

[Cell phone ringing]

<i>[Annette voice message] Uh Claire,
it's Annette..</i>

<i>Listen, we all stayed late after you left...</i>

<i>and we are not minimizing your
feelings in any way at all...</i>

<i>but we all agreed it might be best if
you found another group.</i>

<i>Maybe one to help you deal with
your anger issues.</i>

<i>We think you are better served, elsewhere.
That's all.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

<i>[Man on voice-mail] Hey, it's me. </i>

<i>Uh listen, you think I could come by
and pick up the rest of my stuff.</i>

<i>Maybe when you aren't there.</i>

<i>I think it's prudent... if we don't see
each other... not yet.</i>

Prudent?!

I wonder where he learned that word.

Ready?

Oh, yeah. I'm gonna eat this in a few
minutes, okay?

I just want some quiet time.

Promise?
Promise.

On my mother's grave.
But your mother lives.

Ok here, why don't you take this.

No, no, no, no.

Silvana, c'mon.
This isn't my way, no.

Go be with your family.
Ok, thank you very much.

Don't forget. Please do not... set
the alarm.

I know, I know.

I'm sorry.
Ok, it's just it's so loud.

Yes. Sleep well, I hope.
[Claire sighs]

Night.

Fuck me!

[Claire crying out and groaning]

Okay.

Huh!

Nice night, huh?

<i>[Silvana whispers] Good morning.</i>

<i>Good morning. Good morning.</i>

Mrs. Bennet.

What time is it?

Why are you so cold.

Am I?
Yeah, you poor thing.

Come. Come Claire.

No, it doesn't work!
Yes, you have to do it.

My sister has a big scar and it's gone.

It doesn't matter.
You have to do it.

Uh uh.
It's good for you.

Ok when I'm dressed, I'm gonna
go to the clinic.

What?!
Nothing.

Never take Crescent Heights!

How can you know?
Because I can feel it.

Crescent Heights is like being thrown in
a burlap sack...

and being carted across the tundra
by a horse.

I don't understand.

Just... just make a left at the light...

and take Fairfax instead.

Okay.

LEAP FOR JOY!
YOU ARE DOING GREAT!

<i>[Nurse] Number 47. Number 47.</i>

That's you.
Oh.

Next time just say my name.

Trust me, no one gives a shit.

How's it going?
I'm doing really well.

That support group has made all
the difference.

Good.

I thought it would. Just, other women
super supportive, non threatening.

Exactly.
Great.

Oh shit.

I can't seem to find the authorization
from your primary.

Dr. Shipman's office said they sent it over.

I'm sure they did.

I swear I'd lose my head if it wasn't
attached to my body.

Yeah I know. I'm the same way.

I write reminders about my reminders.
[Laughs]

Right.
How's your daughter doing?

She's almost a senior. It's hard to
believe. Thanks for asking.

Is she still interested in UCLA?
Uh huh.

Who knows if alumni recommendations
mean anything anymore but...

let me know when she applies. I'd be
happy to write one.

We will definitely take you up on that.

You're too sweet.

I don't wanna waste your time. I'm gonna
go ahead and get you a few Percocets...

and Oxycontin to tide you over. Just
don't tell anyone.

And I'll call the office and have them
re-fax it.

Great. Thank you.
Okay.

No, thank you.
Keep up the good work.

You're doing really great.

No, no. Put that... you can go home, Silvana.

It's early.
Not really. No, actually.

Well maybe I'll wash... patio...
Silvana, go home please.

Really?
Yeah.

Well, okay.

[Loud knocking on door]

[Patio door slides open]

Not there.

You're my Juanita, comprende.

Hmm.
Oh my.

[??] Freaky?
Oh no, shit!

Take your pants off.

No no.

No.

Here. I found this in the garage. For
your kids.

Thank you.

Do your kids...
Good night.

[In Spanish] Wait. Wait...

Wait a second.

Why do you have that box?

Your boss gave it to me.

What do you mean my boss gave
it to you?

Go ask her. She gave it to me.

You can't have it.

Go ask...

Look what you did you idiot.

You can't take any of this stuff.

If you take any of this, I swear...

I'll curse you, your kids and
your grand-kids.

Crazy bitch!

Get out of here.

I'm here.


Tell me something new, sweetheart.

What's in the box?

Toys.

For Felipe?

No, I'm saving them for the senora.

Did that bitch make you do that?

Don't say that sweetie.

[Mimicking Claire] Silvana, drive me
to the drug dealer.

I said, be quiet.

She doesn't pay you enough to put up
with her shit, ma.

If I were you I would just quit.

But you're not me, alright?

Can I make you something to eat.

No, my stomach is bothering me.
I don't feel so good.

It's that bitches fault.

I told you to be quiet.

So pretty with such an ugly mouth...

It's true.

Fuck.

[Claire moaning]

[Loud knocking on door]

Arturo, go away.

[Knocking continues]

I said go away!

[Knocking continues loudly and slower]

What the fuck do you want?
I could use something to drink.

Oh god.

Go away.

Go away.

Why are you such a cunt?!

I hate to break it to you, but I don't
believe in ghosts.

Ah, it doesn't really matter coward.

I know.

What's stopping you? You don't believe
in God...

heaven or hell.

You don't believe in anything.

I know.

What about now.

What?
Just do it.

Stop that.
Why don't you just do it.

Get away from me.

Don't be such a coward.
Stop it!

No!

[Claire] God damn it hurts.
[Bonnie] I understand.

No, you obviously don't.

C'mon, spread your hips a bit wider.

Spin your pelvis. You feel your hip
sockets loosen?

I can't.

You can.
Jesus fucking christ!

What are you looking at!?

Hey!

You have to focus.
I am focused.

No, no you're not.
It fucking hurts.

You've had pins in your legs for over a
year. It's gonna hurt.

Your doctor wants me to write an
assessment.

Ah right, c'mon. Fancy ballet moves?

No, I'm worried that it's been zero
improvement, in six months.

I have shown up to every fucking appointment.

Well maybe you would do better with
a... someone else.

Oh, okay.

[Silvana] Where now?
South on the 110.

Tell me when you get near the 105.
Okay.

[Road worker] So I was on break and
I was looking like this, and...

all of a sudden I see a lady climb
up on the ledge...

and I'm like, oh fuck, she bout to jump.

What did you do?

I started yelling at her and I was like,
"don't jump, don't jump".

And I guess she couldn't hear me...

cause it was so far.

Well how long before she jumped?

It was... it was a pretty long time.

Was it a few minutes before she jumped?

Maybe.

She wasn't 100 percent certain.

Well I wouldn't say that cause... cause
she did it and...

she was 100 percent successful.

Right.

to work, okay?

Do we... oh, okay.

So, was she a really good friend of yours?

Yeah... yeah.

Sorry to hear that.
Yeah.

What?!

[Horns blaring]

take a look.

Come back. It's not safe.

Silvana, just stay with the car.

It's not safe.
It's okay.

Come back!

[Claire gasps]

Oh.

Well, hello Claire. How are we doing?
Oh we're doing great!

Well, that's super. Did you find a
new support group?

Oh it's funny you brought that up.

I've actually decided to sue the
support group.

Goodness.

I mean technically I'm not suing
the support group...

but... Los Angeles County cause
they oversee...

the community center that sponsors
the group.

Well..

It's an interesting little case a few years
ago, I thought you would have heard of it.

McDonald vs. City of Glendale, where it
was ruled that support groups could...

"Discriminate on the basis of membership..."

"but not when said discrimination was
legally prohibited..."

"i.e. race, or religion or when it
involved...

"intangible or subjective personality
traits."

I.E. Claire's a raving bitch.

Well but, but a lawsuit...

I'm kidding.

I just came here for Nina's address.

Nina from group?

The one who killed herself? Yeah
that Nina.

Well I'm certain I can't give you
that information, I'm sorry.

Remember when I said I was kidding
about the lawsuit?

Uh huh.
Now I'm not.

Hi.
Hey.

I'm Claire.
Hi, Claire.

I lived in this house when I was
a little girl.

Oh.
That probably sounded very strange.

No.

Well I was wondering if I could
take a look...

but... seems like that would be a bad
idea, now that I'm standing here.

Sure, come in.

May I.
Sure it's a bit of a mess.

You know, but uh...

I uh, I'm trying some things.

Right.
We knocked out the whole kitchen.

Right, wow...

Now we can dine in there.
Hmm, I'll bet.

Uh, could I take a look upstairs?

Yeah, sure.

Okay.

So I'm guessing that this was
your room?

Yeah.

I didn't have the Sponge Bob mural
in those days.

I guess not. - I was more
purples and pinks and...

And what else?

Ah, let's see, my mom painted a scene
from the Nutcracker Suite on the wall.

What scene?
The one with the mice.

How old is um...
Casey.

Casey's...
Five.

Five, that's a handful, huh?


He uh, he sleeps at my mum's cause
he has nightmares.

That's too bad.

Okay?
Uh huh.

[Roy starts slowly down stairs]

[Roy runs back up stairs]

Yeah, this is still the same.

We didn't do anything to the bedroom.

We were gonna but we didn't.

Kind of lost track, you know.

I should go.

Well thank you, again.
Uh huh.

And...

Well it was interesting.
Well I'm glad.

Yeah your performance was impressive.

We didn't do a damn thing to
this house.

So...
Annette, she called me after you left her.

Did you really threaten her?

Yes.

Why?

I don't know. Honestly... I don't know.

You and Nina never even talked about it.

Why did you let me go on like that?

I don't know. Just wanted to see how
far you'd go with it.

I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, that's fine.

I enjoyed myself.

That's fucked up.
So are you.

Uh... I wanna go to Tijuana tomorrow.

Why?
To that pharmacy I was asking you about.

Not a good idea.
You have a green card, right?

Yes.

But no drive...
Silvana if you don't wanna go, I'll just hire someone.

Okay, I'll try.

Are we in Orange Country yet?
I don't know.

Do you only see white people?

I don't know, maybe.

That means fucking Orange County.

Pretty houses.

Ah I hated trials in Orange County.

A. you assume that everyone's a
fucking retard...

or B. you have to assume that everyone is
a fucking right wing Nazi sympathizer.

Hey I'm Claire the ACLU defense attorney.

Please don't hold that against my client
and sentence him to death for shoplifting.

Okay.

And don't get me started on that
fucking Nixon library.

Did you take your medicine today?

Would we be driving to Tijuana if I took
my fucking medicine today?!

[Upbeat Spanish music playing]

Alright so how does this work?
Don't worry, I speak English.

Oh great, okay.

What do you need?
I made a list.

And then I checked on the internet to see
if they were available in Mexico.

It's a lot. Trying to sedate a small city?

This is a very good soap. I need it at home.
Get it, get it.

Do you have prescriptions?
I thought we didn't need prescriptions!

Well at the border, unless you have
prescriptions, they will take them away.

Okay, so what do we do?

What do we do?!

We open up Mary...

That's very tricky. What if we get caught?

You're a rich white woman. Have you ever
been caught at anything?!

Will you just get me something
other than Mary?!

I have problems with anything religious.

I think you have bigger problems.

Perceptive.

Ah, that's the one.

What was your favorite restaurant
when you lived here?

Are you hungry?
Yeah.

I am hungry.

I knew a very good place, but
it's not cheap.

Skyâ€™s the limit. C'mon. Let's go.
Okay.

Who's this guy again?
San Judas Tadeo.

Saint Jude.

The saint patron of lost and
desperate causes.

Perfect.

What?
Silvana?

Ay Chatita...

What a surprise! How are you?

Very good. What a miracle!

This is Mrs. Bennet.

My friends Irma and Innocencia.
Oh, nice to meet you.

Delighted.

Chatita, I heard a rumor...

that Nuncio can't find a job.

No, my husband has a job.

Is that right?

Yes, of course. He has a great job.

He's building pools. Really big pools.

Really?
Yes, really nice ones.

I'll be right back.

How is Christina?

My daughter is doing really
well, thank you.

She was always so beautiful.
Did she finally get married?

No, she's not married yet...
She is a nurse.

That's what happens in America.

Silvana do you wanna go shopping more
or do I have to get you home?

Shopping.
Yeah? Okay great.

Excuse me.
Your change senora.

Silvana, thank you for lunch.
It was just wonderful.

Very nice to meet you ladies.

Well, ladies. It was good to
see you.

Maybe we'll see each other
again soon.

Goodbye Chatitas.
All the best.

I was afraid you don't speak
Spanish.

I understood a few words, but mostly
it was those bitches attitudes.

Thank you.
De Nada [You're welcome].

They are friends when I was young,
you know. Now they're not my friends.

Because of money.

That's fucked up.
That's life.

What's going on?
Why don't you sit up.

I'd really rather not.

But it doesn't hurt you to sit up.

Silvana, I don't want to.
Maybe it's good to do now.

Please!

I need you to pull over, please.
Yes.

Oh god. Shit!

Can I make a phone call?

To who?
My husband.

I just wanna let him know we're
running late.

Alright.

Thank you.

<i>- [On phone] Jason Bennets office.</i>
It's Claire. Will you please put me through.

<i>- He's on another call.</i>
This is important.

What are you doing here?

I wanted to make sure you got home okay.

You could have called.
Well...

Your phone always goes to voice-mail
and you never really call me back.

Oh, right.

Hey.

Silvana.
Mr. Bennet.

Good to see you. You look thin, you know.

Good to see you.
We're okay.

We're okay. You can leave now.

Uh you're not gonna... I don't get
a thank you?

Oh yes. Thank you for abusing your
position within the federal government...

To save your ass.
For some stupid laundry detergent.

And whatever you put in that statue
that they didn't find.

Goodbye.

Goodbye Silvana.

Okay, goodbye Jason.

Uh, maybe I should...get the rest of
my stuff while I'm here?

Not tonight.

Wouldn't be prudent.

You never called my assistant.
I know, I will call her tomorrow.

You're lying.
Couldn't get it past you, huh.

That doesn't say I'm leaving.

I'd love to know how you're doing.

[Sobbing slightly] I've been better.

I'm sorry.

This is gonna sound weird and full of
all kinds of inappropriate intentions...

I can handle it.

And I don't wanna have sex or
anything...

could you just stay in my room with me
until I fall asleep?

Of course.

That was easy.

There you go.
Thank you.

Do you want me to lie down next to you?

No. That's ok.
Ok.

Do you want me to tell you a
bedtime story?

Yeah.

Yeah, tell me a story.

Where everyoneâ€™s angry at the evil witch.

I can do that.

Thank you.

Once upon a time...

<i>This lady traveled to a magical, distant
land called... Tijuana.</i>

Jason?

[Claire sighs]

[Door closes]

I need a ride.

Just running an errand.
Never mind.

Thanks for not asking me why I
sit like this.

Or why you keep turning up
at my house.

Look, I'm not a stalker.

Okay.
I mean not in the traditional sense.

I don't care. It doesn't bother me either way.

I like your attitude.

NINA COLLINS
JULY 25,1982 - MARCH 19,2014
BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER


[Claire] Is that granite?
Uh huh.

Do you know where they got it?

I'm thinking of putting a kitchen island
in my back yard.

Some Greek guy. I'll get you his card.
That'd be great.

Great.

She was 31.
Yeah.

I never would have thought that.
Why's that?

She just looked younger.

[Chimes ringing]

Could you uh...
Oh yeah.

Give me that.
Okay.

MOM

I think that's illegal.
I don't give a shit.

Oh great, thanks.

I was just in Tijuana.
Oh, what for?

This guy I was dating.

He wanted to go down there and get
drunk on cheap booze...

and then watch women have sex
with donkeys.

I'm kidding.
Good.

I was just down there for work.
What kind of work?

Nothing, nothing interesting.

Really?
Uh huh.

You know how my wife killed herself?

Yes.

Did she leave a note?

No.

I did this exercise in the suicide
support group where they...

your partner pretends to be the
one who died.

Do you want to know what I said
to my beautiful wife.

Yeah.
Thank you for ruining my life.

Thank you for ruining Casey's life.

Thank you for leaving me in this
fucking mess.

I hate you so much I can
barely breath.

I hope you burn in hell.

Cause that's where you left
me and Casey.

Hell I scared my partner.

They might have thought I was gonna
bash their face in.

Do I scare you?
Uh huh.

But that's not a bad thing.

Cheers... mate. [He's Australian]
Cheers mate.

Okay.

Oh, that's a challenge.

Okay, we gotta get...

I gotta make something clear.
Ooh he said, changing the mood of the room.

Seriously.
Yes.

I don't wanna have sex.
I know.

I just wanna make that clear.
I know.

I get it. I don't like to sleep by
myself either.

Very Claire clear.

Shit! Oh...

<i>[Billy Joel's "Honesty" plays] â™ªHonestyâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ª is hardly ever heardâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ªAnd mostly what I need from you â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ªI can find a loverâ™ª</i>

Oh that's enough of that [turns off music]

Enough of the fucking honesty.

Shit.

[Ringing doorbell persistently]

What's going on?

I took a fucking cab!

Why?
It dawned on me.

You are more than a little depressed. I
didn't have your phone number.

You think I was going to kill myself?
Not that that's any of my business.

I didn't. I'm alive.
I see.

[??] Didn't die.
Good, you're not dead.

I'd have to break in, call the police, whoo.

It's a relief.

You know you just could have said
you wanted to come over.

Yeah but what's the fun in that?

Oh, good girl. Good girl, good girl.

You know there are plenty of people
who think...

you steal a person's soul when you
take their picture.

[Roy snoring]

Hi slut.
Oh, hey.

Thanks for the Percocet.

What are you doing here? He doesn't
even like you.

He's in mourning for me.

He's not thinking clearly.
Give me a fucking break.

You just use people.

I know.

Fuck you!

Your language is very degrading
to this group.

You know, I could hear him yell
"don't jump".

Don't jump... don't jump!

[Doorbell rings]

[Doorbell rings]

Oh Jeez... jeez.
What's going on?

I forgot my mum's dropping of Casey.
He's staying here.

What happened to your face?

Um...

Would you mind letting me finish... peeing.

Oh God.


Happy birthday.
Can you give me a kite?

It's not your birthday. Your birthday is
next week.

Oh, right.

I want a big one. I want a shark kite.

I like any animal that bites.

You okay?
Yeah.

I'm good. I'm actually fine, thank you.

[Inaudible. Roy talking to Casey]



[Roy] You got the camera ready?
[Casey] Uh huh.

[Roy talking to Casey inaudible]

What do you think of that?

Everything's blue. That's silly.

Well Picasso did it and that turned
out pretty good for him.


[?? Casey says something inaudible]
[?? Roy replies, inaudible]

[Inaudible Roy and Casey talking]

I'll be right back.

I outta smack that thing right off of
your fucking face.

What?

Oh you heard me. Leave me the fuck alone!

Yes?
I'm a friend of Claires.

I think you drove her to my house one day.

Oh yes. She's sleeping now.

Very tired, you know.

She left this...
Yeah, give it to me.

I'll just wait, here.
Excuse me?

I'm a bit worried about her.

Do you want to come in?

[Chimes tinkling]

Claire. Listen Claire.

Oh, Jesus!

I'm sorry... sorry.

Is that you or am I hallucinating?
No, it's me.

Prove it.

You'll have to trust me.

I lied about Nina not leaving a note.

It's not very original.

FORGIVE ME

Silvana told me about your accident.

And your little boy.

Silvana needs to keep her fat mouth shut.

She cares about you.

I pay her to care about me.

It's not my fault she gets sentimental.

And don't you get sentimental either.

I can't save you.

I can barely save myself or my kid.

I'm not asking you to.

Silvana?

Yes?

Silvana, you have this habit... of
letting everyone into the house.

But he's a friend, no?

And, I think you get angry but...

Why, what?

I invite him... and his boy... for lunch...
the day after tomorrow.

What?!

I'll make tamales. You love my tamales, no?

I don't care! I don't give a shit!
That's not the point.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Well what did he say?

He say yes.

Good.

Good.

Maybe you can make some of those
mango tamales too.

Yes, whoo, anything more?
Yes!

The next time someone comes to
the front door...

You have to ask me, before you let them in.

Yes, yes, yes.
Even if it's Jesus fucking Christ himself!

You don't have to say Jesus...
You gotta start making tamales...

and I gotta go shopping. So let's do this.

Claire.
Hi.

I really didn't think I'd see you again.

I have to get something off my chest.

Okay.

I am in a lot of pain.

I know.
You may know but...

sometimes I suspect you think that I'm
this uncooperative...

old bitch who's just making all of this up.

Do you want to get better, really? No
bullshit, do you want to?

I do.

Annette, Annette...

Oh come on. Annette, we need to talk.

I have nothing to say to you.
I really wanna apologize.

I got in a lot of trouble.

You made me look very unprofessional.

I come bearing conciliatory gifts.
Like what, a poison apple?

That's good. No I actually brought you
a really nice bottle of vodka.

What kind?
Big one, from Costco.

Show me.

Okay.

Put it on the floor!

What?
I accept your apology...

You can put the bottle on the floor
and go home.

Do you want me to hand it to you?
No.

Fair enough.

Have a nice day.
Thank you Claire.

Can I swim?

You didn't bring your swimwear.
Oh.

You can go in your underwear.
No.

Alright you can go naked.
No.

I might have something he can borrow.

Yeah, Silvana needs time to get the
feast spread anyway, so...

Just hold on a sec.

You have to say thank you.

Hey, Silvana?

Silvana?!
Yes?

Can you... can you just come and help
me for a second.

Where are you?

I'm in... oh...

What are you doing here?
I need to...

I just need to find a bathing suit
for Casey.

Maybe...
I will find it.

I will find it.
Thank you.

I left my support group.

Oh.
Yeah, there was just... too much anger.

It was tiring.
Hmm.

Anger feels so good.
It's just a drug.

I think I'm gonna go back to work,
next week.

Really.
Yeah, I gotta get out of my head.

They've got great drugs for that.
Yeah.

I think I'm gonna move too.

You're full of resolutions today.
I might wanna get my hair done.

I didn't get my hair done.

Why, what's wrong with my hair?
Nothing. It's very nice.

Can I ask you something?
Sure.

How can you still live here?

I like my house.

Maybe, but don't you feel like you're
surrounded by ghosts?

No... no.

You know what I mean. All the memories.
Why don't you try some wine?

Yeah?
Yeah.

Okay.

Hey, little pirate. Wanna dive for some
treasure? Okay, gold.

Ready?

[Sound of Roy and Casey playing
in the pool in the background]

I think we should applaud.

No, no, no. That's okay.. that's okay.

I'm really glad you guys came to lunch.
Thank you. I am too.

[Doorbell rings]

Silvana, ignore it.
[Silvana] One second.

What did you used to have on the wall?

Oh just something, I need to get something
that works better in the room.

[Silvana] Mrs. Bennet?
Hmm?

There's a man, he asks for you.
What's his name?

He not say.
Well do you know who he is?

Nope.
Well tell him to go away.

He's probably a Jehova's witness.

Well I did but he say he wait outside.

Oh, Jesus Christ, I'll have to do it
myself.

He won't say his name.

Get off my fucking property before
I call the police.

I'm sorry... I wish I could do something.
I can't live with myself.

If I can switch places, I would. I wanted
to tell you that, at the trial.

But my lawyers wouldn't let me.

You piece of shit. Get out of here. Get out!
<i>- [Dog barking furiously in the next yard]</i>

Damn you. I should fucking kill you.
<i>- [Dog continues barking wildly]</i>


[Claire continues cursing Leonard
while dog is barking loudly]

[Leonard] I'm sorry.
Silvana don't you dare take him inside this house.

She's right.
Please get the fuck out of here.

[Sound of TV playing in background becomes
more and more distorted]

[Distorted TV sounds continue with other
distorted trippy sounds and rumbling]

[Claire] Oh, god... oh god.
[Distorted sounds continue]


[High pitched laser sound as Claire flashes
back]

[Worker's voice] Don't jump.

[Sound of car skidding and crashing]

[Woman's voice in flashback]
Don't jump, don't jump]

[Flashback noise fades out]

[Silvana's voice echoing in prayer inaudible]

[Claire mumbles inaudible]

I like your cute do.
Thanks.

Wish I could say the same about you.
No. I might go with a [??] bouquet.

You're probably wondering about the cake.

I didn't wanna be rude, but yes.

Remember when Annette asked us what
our dream would be...

if we didn't have chronic pain?

God I always hated her drippy little
exercises.

Yours was to have sex with the entire
Madrid soccer team.

And yours was sickeningly sincere.

What's wrong with a mother wanting to make
her son a birthday cake from scratch?

Everybody in the group cried when I
told mine.

Everybody except you.

I had my reasons.

I know that now.
I know you know.

To be honest, I was never impressed
with the whole saint Nina thing.

Saints don't jump off bridges.

I give you points for execution.
I thought you'd like that.

Make a wish.

I can't think of anything.
Doesn't matter. Just blow them out.

Claire starts screaming.

[Nurse] It's okay, it's okay.
[Claire screaming] Ah, don't touch me!

Okay I won't.
Don't touch me. Please no more drugs.

I said no more of this shit!

Get this out of me.

[Nurse] I need help in here!
No, no...

[Nurse] It's okay.
Oh god.

<i>[On TV] Once a popular symbol of 
youth culture...</i>

<i>Drive in theaters have mostly disappeared
in the United States.</i>

<i>One of the last operating drive-in
theaters...</i>

<i>is in the California city of Riverside.</i>

You should eat something. How about
that applesauce?

We went to a drive-in.
Who?

It was our first date. We were law
students at UCLA.

I should have known you were a lawyer.

Touche, Imelda.
It's Melaya.

But I do like new shoes.

Found out I like Billy Joel.

Not in an ironic way.

I got so drunk on Rum and Coke.

He held my hair back while I puked.

Kept rubbing my back, saying...

It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

That's nice.

I believed him.

[Claire groans]

We're going on a little trip, Silvana.
To home, yes.

No it's Riverside.
No, only home.

Riverside! You'll see.

[Claire moans in pain]

Are you okay?

[Claire groaning]

[Dance music from movie playing on screen]

[Silvana and Claire laughing]

[Claire in pain] Oh, Silvana.

We're outta Coke.

I'll get.
No, no Silvana.

No, no, I'll get.
No Silvana, let me go.

I gotta get out of this car anyway.

You wanna drink?
No, no nothing.

[Claire yelps in pain]

Careful.

[Train passing by]

It's really hard without the drugs, isn't it.

It is unbelievably hard.

What would Saint Jude do?

I bet that son of a bitch would lay
down on those tracks...

and just let Union Pacific put
him out of his misery.

They need about a mile to stop, right?

More or less.

Great.

Your last thoughts are important, Claire.

They're all you get to take with you.

McDonald's french fries.

Coppertone sunscreen.

I love that smell.

I was a mouse in the Nutcracker Suite
three years in a row.

You were adorable.

I wanted to play Clara the Sugar Plum Fairy
but my mom said I wasn't graceful enough.

Claire, we're running out of time.

[Sound of train whistle blowing
in the distance]

Say it, Claire.

Say it.

I was a good mother.

I was a good mother.

[Silvana] Mrs. Bennet.
Silvana.

Now that's it, senora. That's it...

I've been trying to deal with your bad
attitude, your insults...

but I can't take it anymore.

You sleep with any low-life who
walks in front of you...

Silvana.
you get drunk, you use drugs...

Silvana!

and on top of it all you treat me like a dog,
and pay me like a dog!

God, Silvana I've never heard you this angry.
I don't know why I worry about you.

I don't know why I light candles to the Virgin
Mary and ask her to protect you.

You know what, senora, you want to kill
yourself?

Then kill yourself. Kill yourself!
Silvana...

Forgive me sweet Mary for saying these
things, but I'm only human.

You have so much good, so much
beauty in your life...

and what did you do? You drove Mr. Bennet away
when all he wanted was to take care of you.

He lost his child too!

Silvana, I'm gonna let you rant in Spanish
as long as you want...

because I can only imagine how frustrated
you must be with me.

I'm not frustrated, senora.

"Frustrated" is too small a word to
describe what I'm feeling.

I should've left you months ago,
you know.

Silvana.
What?!

We have a bigger problem.

This is all we need!

They said that they would bring the
rental in the morning.

You call your family, okay.

Okay.

Oh, Jesus. That's not gonna happen.


[Silvana] I'll sleep in the chair.
No.

Silvana no. No, please.
I don't mind.

Good night, Silvana.
Buenos Noches.

Oh!

Can I help you?
No, I wasn't gonna steal anything.

Ah, where'd you run away from?

Boise.

I've never been to Boise.

It's beautiful.
Let me guess.

You are on your way to LA.

Yeah!

So what happened? Was it gory?

My parachute failed to open and I fell
ten thousand feet to the ground.

Did not.
Did too.

What's in LA?
I'm gonna be an actress.

Yeah, that's a sad story.

I hate to tell you but you're gonna end
up in porn...

cause that's what happens to girls
from Idaho.

Gross. I won't do porn!

Yes, this is what happens to bad girls.

I'm just trying to help you avoid some
of the many mistakes...

that you seem so intent on making.

Where you always such a fucking shrew.

[Claire laughs]

Oh, someone took a Shakespeare class.

God you know what sounds so good
right now?

A homemade yellow cake with
fudge frosting.

Wanna make 100 bucks?

I just want you to make me a cake.

Sure.

Okay, so, the kitchen... is in here.
Anything I can do to help?

Uh, no. Stay out of my fucking way.

Okay.

HE BELONGS HERE.

Yes. I'd like to speak to Jason, please.

Yes, um, I'd like to leave a message.

Would you just tell him, thank you
for the gift.

Yeah.

Mrs. Bennet!

What, what's...

What time is it?
Tomorrow. The girl stole.

She took your purse, the money on
the counter.

Oh God.

You underestimate me.
I call the police.

Oh, no, no, no, no. It's fine. I'll
just cancel my credit cards.

Not only, because...

She [??]
She's...

I knew from the beginning.
I know.

She was a bad girl, you know.
She's a kid.

I told you.
I know you did.

That is homemade fudge frosting. Taste that.


This thief can cook.
Right.

Hey.
Hey.

Is Casey here?
He's playing at the neighbors.

Okay. Can I come in?

Sure.
Thank you.

Wait.
What?

Just give me one second.

All right. Never mind.

[Car starts]
