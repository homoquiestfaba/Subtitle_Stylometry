Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...

but at the same time,
restore its creative power...

to reinvigorate our society...

My name is Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

Our obligation...

California families
who live by the rules...

and work hard
and pay their taxes...

shouldn't be paying
for people who do nothing.

I'm Jay Bulworth.

I believe in a hand up,
not a hand down.

I need your support on Tuesday.

I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

I'll fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs.

I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep

Our obligation is to reduce...

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

Our welfare system
is out of control.

Of course we should help...

My name is Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

My wife Connie and I
have been married for 24 years.

She's been a loving partner,
and more importantly...

Connie's been my friend.

Jay has been a great
senator for California...

but the best job he's done is
as a loving husband and father.

I believe
in the old-fashioned values...

of honesty and decency
and fidelity.

Join me in my crusade...

to strengthen
California's families.

Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

We can't afford any longer
to give people privileges...

on the basis of race.

It's time we realized
discrimination in the past...

doesn't justify discrimination
in the future.

Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

Our welfare system
is out of control.

Of course we should help
families who truly need it...

but too often, welfare
is a permanent subsidy...

for able-bodied people
who could and should...

Hello, this is
a telephone answering machine.

Leave a message at the beep.

If you're there,
pick up the goddamn telephone.

I know you're there.

Pork bellies, indeed.

I've just spoken with Hong Kong
again, and I'm very upset!

That's the wrong word.
I'm pissed, pissed...

pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed!

I warned you repeatedly
about Fenner.

That son of a bitch and
his pork belly goddamn schemes.

And now he tells me...

He tells me you've invested
nearly everything you had...

and they're selling
the goddamn things short.

We got the check.

The senator would just love
to have drinks with the sultan.

Will the sultan be
in Beverly Hills?

Has he buzzed yet?
No.

Feldman call?

It's 6:15 in the morning in L.A.

I don't care.
Get me Liebowitz and Macavoy.

I only got two hands.
I'm too old to grow a third.

I didn't ask you
to grow anything new.

Just get me the calls.

And Mr. Chow?
What about Mr. Ling?

Tell me, did his check clear?

Hey, Senator.

It's a beautiful morning.

The birds are singing.
The leaves are...

doing whatever leaves do.

Did you eat anything?

It's Friday.
That pizza's from Wednesday.

Ahem.

Fenner call?

He said you sold pork bellies
short, and now they're up again.

I mean, is that a disaster?

Davers, do I look like
a disaster to you?

Good morning.

The poll's
worse than we thought.

We're down by four points...

but the new spots
are playing absolutely huge...

and we'll get 900 grand
from the Sunday brunch.

You might be asked about that
insurance bill in five minutes.

Which insurance bill?

S2720...
regulates insurance companies.

Makes them sell it
to poor people.

That's a good bill.

Not for insurance companies.

What, are we working
for the insurance companies?

We do today, or Tuesday,
we don't work for anybody.

We're trying to get
50 grand a table.

Should we talk on the way?

Senator, Missy Berliner,
Los Angeles Times.

Sam.

Senator, your challenger
in next Tuesday's primary...

said you were, quote,
"an old liberal wine...

"trying to pour himself
into a new conservative bottle".

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

That kind of mistake can hurt.
What mistake?

The both sides remark.
Hello, Constance.

I don't know
why your people would think...

I have nothing better to do
than wait around.

I have no objection
to doing my part...

but the least you can do
is to get your staff...

to show some respect
for my time.

Uh-huh.
What about both sides?

It was Bob Sheer, right?

Weren't we supposed to go with
"We'll get back to you, Bob?"

"Both sides" implies the other
side is worth considering.

Where's Becky?
She doesn't want a photo op.

She's 17. She wants
to be with her friends.

Is she mad at me?

She's not mad. She's 17.

Just send her money.
She'll be fine.

Smile in the back, please.

OK, that's it.

Uh, Con... Uh...

We want to thank you all
for your help.

Any other help, please
make payable to Bulworth '96.

Serum cholesterol,
folate level...

liver function, blood pressure,
EKG... they're all fine.

Are you eating?

Uh, no, thanks.

No, I'm asking, have you
experienced a loss of appetite?

No, no, no.
I'm just not very hungry.

When was the last time you ate?

Mr. Fong
and the Chung family left.

Will Mr. And Mrs. Wang
be in California?

Hello, Helen, how are you?

Hello, Mr. Crockett.
Hello, Mrs. Dobish.

Mr. Crockett,
American Insurance Federation.

Jay. Jay.

Are you telling me you haven't
eaten or slept in three days?

That's not good.

Maybe you should talk
to someone.

I'll give you a name.
Milton Alexander.

He's head of Psychiatry
at Georgetown.

Uh, I got a meeting here.

This bill will devastate us.

It will be...
Crockett.

Can I call you back?

Doc, how's he doing?

Fine. Fine.

How are you doing?
Fine, fine. You?

Fine.
Fine.

Can you believe
this goddamn regulation bill?

Is the whole world going insane?

When you consider
the dislocation...

in the relationships
with the state commissioners...

or the effect
on the rate structure...

This bill's
gonna cost us billions.

And it's the usual people
making trouble.

You think I'm gonna say
it's the African Americans.

It's not the African Americans.

I have no problem
with African Americans.

I'm not other people.

Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan...

I have no problem with them.
They have good jobs.

But you throw down
some lazy, welfare-taking...

drug-dealing,
rap-singing punk...

and tell me my people
have to give him a policy. Why?

So he can burn down his house?
Or smoke crack and get AIDS?

You can't get AIDS
by burning your house down.

We got
the broadcasters, insurance...

A.M.A... Buddhists?

What about the Buddhists?

Vinnie! Ha ha ha ha!

Vinnie, you son of a bitch,
how are you?

How you been?

Other than the prostate
like a coffee cake...

a little ticker trouble...
terrific.

To use an overworked phrase,
this bill is...

The bill is un-American.

And I have
total confidence in you...

that you can bottle up this bill
in committee.

What have we got there?

Oh, I got
your homeowner's insurance...

disability insurance,
umbrella, liability...

and I see no reason
why you shouldn't have...

a couple million dollars
in life insurance.

I thought we said ten.

What?
Ten. Ten million.

Pesos?

Senator... Ha ha ha.

I feel constrained to remind you
that what we said was...

a couple of million
paid to your daughter...

Four payments,
2.5 million each...

ten million dollars
to my daughter.

Would five do it?

Why don't we just say seven?

Ten million.
That's a lot of life insurance.

If Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we'll play ball.

Oh, Senator,
I want you to meet Vinnie.

Vinnie, how are you?

Ready for the weekend
research project?

Davers, could you excuse us?
Thanks.

Uh, all right, Senator,
I'll be right outside.

Tell her we need
U.S. American dollars.

Small bills.

I wish I didn't have to go
through Davers to talk to you.

Davers can always reach me.
Davers is a sweetheart.

Did Davers ask you...

what the weekend
research project was?

Uh-uh.

Good.
Nobody knows but you and me.

You and me, Senator.

That's good.

Here's a couple of pictures
of the person.

Give them to whomever
is gonna do the, uh...

Research.
Research.

This is the first time...

I've ever arranged
to get a guy to off a guy...

who I don't know who the guy is
who he's gonna off.

You mean, research.

Yeah, research a guy
who I don't know who it is.

You said
you didn't have to know.

I'm just the liaison. I don't
want to know who this is...

and I don't want nobody knowin'
nothin' about me.

I need to talk to you,
I call Eddie Davers.

You need to talk to me,
you call Eddie Davers.

That way nobody knows nothin'.

Fine.
Except for one thing.

What's that?
I gotta know who this guy is.

You just said...
But that was in the abstract.

Now that we're really
doin' it...

and you don't tell me
who this is, and then, uh...

Simple math.

Take a look.

Excuse me.

What's the gag?

He will be arriving at LAX...

tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.

A check for the second half
of the money.

If I'm not dead by Monday,
I stop payment on that check.

Thank you for flying with us.

Have a pleasant stay
in Los Angeles.

As you exit the aircraft,
our flight agents...

will help direct you
to any connecting flights.

Oh, and have a nice day.

Welcome back.
Did you sleep on the plane?

We're running late, so let me
run through some changes.

By the way,
excellent work with Crockett.

The final haul
from the Sunday brunch is 1.1.

Insurance came up with 250.

We got two from oil, banks
are in for one and a half...

A.M.A. And the lawyers
came in just south of 100.

Gloria Allred got very excited
over your O.J. Statement.

Even the women have coughed up.
Came in with about 65.

We do have a new schedule.

We have a black church,
and then we have Beverly Hills.

He's here.

It'd be nice later
to have a drink with the sultan.

The guy is nuts.

Welcome home, Senator.

What's this?
I told you.

Twenty-four hours
on the campaign trail.

This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.

And Fred Tinsdale
and Mimi Binder.

How you doing?
Mimi and I are gonna be...

right behind you
in the truck, Senator.

MIMl: Fred, get in the truck.

So, C-SPAN
is gonna be with us all night?

All weekend.
Tonight's installment...

airs tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

Where are we going?

First stop, we are going
down to South Central.

Did you get a copy
of the schedule?

We're gonna be on the go.

First stop is South Central and
the African-American community.

Gee, your African-American
constituents...

down in South Central...

don't forget what you've done
for them, do they?

Where we going?

Down to Grace Church.

Fred.
What?

Did you say
you'd covered Bulworth before?

Yeah.
These things go by the book.

Then over to Beverly Hills...

to meet some big names
in the entertainment business.

Scotty, how are you?

Vivian, Rwanda,
I didn't expect you to be here.

Those key chains look fantastic.

How you feeling, Senator?

Get any sleep on the plane?

Has Mr. Murphy
forgotten something?

Mr. Murphy, the senator?

Whoops.

Senator? Senator Bulworth.

Senator...

The honorable senator
from California...

the Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

Yay!
Yay!

Hey, that's a nice
little piece of timing.

Amen.

Senator, your speech, sir.

Amen!

We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

Listen to this.
I put a little time in on this.

And at the same time,
restore its creative power...

to reinvigorate our society...

And, uh...

bring about a, uh, rebirth
of, uh, democracy, uh...

Any questions?

Nice. Less is more.

When the riots went down
four years ago...

you promised us
federal funding to rebuild.

What happened?

What happened was...

we all knew
that was gonna be big news...

so we all came down here...
Bush, Clinton, Wilson...

got our pictures taken, told you
what you wanted to hear...

and we pretty much
forgot about it.

Ha ha ha!

Did you hear that?

Let's see where he's going.

We can't get health insurance,
fire insurance, life insurance.

Why haven't you come out
for Senate Bill 2720?

Because you haven't contributed
any money to my campaign.

You know how much insurance
companies come up with?

They depend on me
to get a bill like that...

and bottle it up in committee
during an election...

and then we can kill it
when you're not looking.

When you say "by the book",
what book would that be?

So the Democrats
don't care about us?

Isn't that obvious?

Half your kids are out of work
and the other half are in jail.

Do you see any Democrat
doing anything about it?

Certainly not me.

What are you going to do,
vote Republican?

Come on. You're not
gonna vote Republican.

Let's call a spade a spade.

I mean, you can have
a Billion Man March.

If you don't put down
that malt liquor...

and stop backing a running back
who stabs his wife...

you're never gonna
get rid of somebody like me.

Fire! Fire! Fire!

Yo, fire alarm!
Nina, let's be out.

Fire!

Right this way, Senator.

What are you doing?

That was good.
That was really good.

Fire!

Does anybody know
where the fire actually is?

Where's the fire?

Does anybody know
exactly where the fire is?

I find it very worrying
that in 1990 Los Angeles...

churches are burning.

Smell smoke? I don't smell shit.

If there's a fire,
I don't know where it is.

We have to be running along.

Coming through. Thank you.

Hey, Senator! Listen, hon.

Like what she said.
We into politics.

We want to work
on your campaign.

We need some jobs volunteering.
I don't mind volunteering.

It's on to Beverly Hills
on our new schedule...

and our friends the Liebowitzes.

We're into
that whole political... Nina.

To prevent any damage
to this wonderful landmark...

Yo.
Yo. Yo to you.

Later.
I was hoping for sooner.

What'd you say?
Later is good.

You tryin' to mack on my sister?

There's no macking
going on here, young man.

I really think
we should be on our way.

We should go.

Feldman, my friends here
would like to volunteer.

What can you help us with?

It's a shame we didn't get
into the heart of your remarks.

You want to volunteer?

You've always had tremendous
support in this district.

Come on, that Nina. Woof!

Oh, yes.

Woof! Woof!

Never underestimate
the value of a frank exchange.

What does "mack" mean?
Mack?

Macavoy, what does mack mean?
Gary, do you know?

Like, "You're macking
on my sister"?

For you to be running
against Hugh Weldie...

who has just leapt on
the neoconservative bandwagon...

Uh, is your sciatic nerve
bothering you again?

No, no, no, I'm fine.

Several of our people
find Weldie's duplicity...

particularly, uh...

You've had such a tough day.

What do you say we get you
some downtime?

I could cover for you
at the Liebowitzes'.

Are you kidding me?
Absolutely.

After all the money
we've worked these guys for?

We get more money from
these jokers than the Chinese.

I'll tell you what.
I've got an idea. Pull over.

Gary, what do you say you and I
and your colleagues...

head on over to headquarters?

That is a good idea. Great.

Let's do that. Come on, Gar.

And we'll see you
in Beverly Hills.

That is a good idea.

Gary, this is gonna be
much better.

You are gonna get
a behind-the-scenes look...

at how a campaign
actually operates.

You eat on the plane, Senator?

No.

How long since you ate?
Wednesday.

Ha ha ha!

Pull in here, will you?
I'm starving.

Let's get some chicken wings.

Frankly, this is getting
uncomfortable for me.

A third of the guests
have left already.

A third of the guests are drunk.

When do you think he'll be here?

I think he'll be here
any second.

You do?

He's had such a day.

The senator is helping
the state department...

work out details
on a new guarantee.

A new guarantee? I'm sorry.

The West Bank.
You didn't hear it from me.

The West Bank.

He'll be here any second.

Yo, Senator Bulworth.

Here we are... volunteer valets.

Manny and Dorothy Liebowitz.

Hello. It's good to see you.

Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman
had to leave...

but I'm sure they'd agree
the security of the West Bank...

is more important
than you being on time.

I was just grabbing a bite.

Come in.

We'll be out shortly.

We can't ask the Liebowitzes
to throw open their doors...

to a national
television audience, can we?

Nonsense.
Mi casa es su casa, huh?

Yes!

Oh, miss, um...

Thank you very much.

Do you think those of us
in the entertainment business...

need government help
in determining limits...

on the amount
of sex and violence...

in today's films
and television programs?

You know, the funny thing
is how, uh...

Lousy most of your stuff is.

You make violent films
and dirty films...

and you make family films...

but most of 'em
are not very good, are they?

It's funny
that so many smart people...

could work so hard and
spend all that money...

and make so much money on 'em...

What do you think it is?

It must be the money, huh?

It turns everything to crap.

But how much money
do you guys really need?

I mean...

you be honest with me,
and don't spare my feelings.

Do you have any more
of the crispy crab cakes?

Wait! Just wait a minute.

Aah!

Do you think
it's advisable...

to schedule campaign stops
with industry leaders...

when you have such
a low opinion of their product?

My guys are not stupid.

They always put the big Jews
on my schedule.

You're mostly Jews here, right?
Three out of four anyway.

Excuse me?

I bet Murphy put something bad
about Farrakhan in here for you.

Thank you, Senator.

I know I speak for you
when I say I'm energized...

by your...
this kind of give and take.

Can you play that
crispy crab cakes remark again?

Hey!

Oh, great.

I think everybody
was challenged by your candor.

Let Bob Dole put that
in his pipe and smoke it.

Just get out!
All of you are fired!

Fuck you! We are volunteers.

The senator's
gonna go to his hotel and sleep.

We stayed
too long already. We out!

You girls want a ride?
Yeah!

Get the stuff.

Get in the limo, big butt.

That shit be awesome!
Where we going?

Where can we drop
you young women?

Just take us down La Brea.
We'll take a bus.

No. We goin' down to Frankie's.

Frankie's?
Yeah.

We'll take you.

I don't want to go down
to no Frankie's.

What's Frankie's?

Are you trippin'?

Let's go, Macavoy.

I can't stand when people
wanna flex their authority.

I can't believe him
tryin' to tell us to...

I don't think you need
to feel badly...

about going to the hotel
and getting some sleep.

You've had a tough day.

Letterman
ain't no Arsenio Hall.

I heard that Arsenio
was a two-minute brother.

You buggin'.

I heard the head of Arsenio's
jimmy big as a apple.

Why don't we take a look
at that new 30-second spot?

My name's Jay Bulworth.

You don't know nothin'
about Arsenio's jimmy.

I got the 411
from Sanequa James.

She saw it up close.
You mean his dick?

I really like it
when you serve the potato salad.

It's very dynamic.

She gave him the nappy dugout.

Nappy dugout?

Man got a nine-inch jimmy.

But she booty ugly!

Dugout, do some nappy tricks.

Nappy dugout.
Jimmy and the nappy dugout.

Nappy tricks.

Some of the Frisbee tricks.
Yeah.

Our welfare system
is out of control.

Ladies,
we'll just be five minutes...

because the senator is meeting
the cardinal in the morning.

If I have to meet
with the mackerel snappers...

can't I just dump the sultan?

Two seconds.
Let me make a security check.

Bulworth!

Oom boop sheh bam
oh coo-coo mop

Can ya sing, Bulworth?

Rock until you can't be a ghost.
You got to sing.

Be a spirit. That's how
these niggers got here.

Ghosts got 'em
when they touched each other.

Be a spirit!

And the spirit will not descend
without song.

You got to sing, fool.

Don't be no ghost, Bulworth!

Not him. No cameras.

That's a tough break.

I thought
they'd let you follow us...

but the camera
must make them nervous.

How disappointing.

He with you?
He all right.

Check your weapons.

I don't think we have
any weapons.

Expecting trouble?
No.

You can't do nothin'
in five years.

His family owns a pork shop
for five years.

Go on. You're good.

He ain't doin' it to honor
all the subspecies of life.

Hey.

Good to see you, my friend.
That's...

What you said
at the church... brave.

If you haven't
been able to talk to me...

you can talk to me now.

Go stand by the door.
Why?

Keep a look out.
Nobody can get in.

Good work. Sit down.

Tell these niggers what's up

Come, come get it

Senator?

Sir, if you're having...
Excuse me.

I need to talk to the Senator.

If you're having a problem,
we should talk about it.

What are you concerned about?

I'm concerned that you told
300 people in a black church...

they wouldn't be a factor...

as long as we're controlled
by insurance.

I'm concerned you went to
a Beverly Hills fund-raiser...

and told people in entertainment
their product is lousy.

And, since many of them
are Jewish...

you thought it prudent
to mock their Jewish paranoia.

I'm concerned we're in a club
in Compton...

before the most important
campaign swing.

God knows what illegal activity
is taking place...

and you're smoking marijuana!

I work for you.
You call the shots...

but I can do my job much better
if you just tell me...

what is this new strategy?

Have a drink, Murphy.
Live your life.

Bartender.

What the hell are you
doin' here, sugar? Chillin'?

God damn!
Leroy, get over here!

Have a drink on me, sweetness.

Leroy, look who's here...
Clint Eastwood! Damn!

That ain't Clint Eastwood.
What do you mean?

That's George Hamilton.

George Hamilton?

He got that TV show.

Hey, George, what's happenin'?
What's up, man?

God damn!

He with you?
Yeah.

What's happenin'?

I don't care who you
think you know. You can't enter.

What you doin'?

Senator, this is fun,
but I'm gonna tell Mac...

to get ready to go.

Put it away.

What's up?

Hi.

You lost, massa?

How you doin'?

This place
ain't for you, motherfucker.

Can we talk?

This place
is for our homies, real niggers.

He ain't no nigger.
I ain't no what?

You ain't no real nigger.

Is you a real nigger?

You callin' me nigger,
motherfucker?

Don't call me nigger,
motherfucker.

Would you prefer
"motherfucker", motherfucker?

What the fuck?
You can't call me motherfucker.

Shit!

You gotta get out of here!

I don't need my sister
coverin' my ass!

Yes, you do!

Move.
Where you goin'?

Get in your car and go!

I saw you rush your brother out.

That's fucked up.
He owes me money.

If I left him there,
you'd cap his ass.

Motherfucker rip off L.D.,
he a dead-ass motherfucker.

I give people protection
around here. Right?

Mm-hmm.

I can give you
protection or pain.

It's wrong to embarrass me,
Nina...

wrong and detrimental
to my way of life.

That motherfucker owe me money.

I'm workin' on gettin' it.

I'm tired of playing with you.

Whenever I see you,
you say that.

I said I'm gonna get it.

The only reason his legs
ain't snapped by now...

is 'cause he's your brother.

If you fall absolute

I thought ya knew,
I thought ya knew

Bitches are hustlers, too

I thought ya knew

Now, what I really want to know

Is where did little Nina go?

I'm lookin' here,
I'm lookin' there

But I can't find her anywhere

Where, oh, where

Is little Nina?

I'm happy with Nina

Hello, Nina

Where you been-a

Nina, Nina

Nina

Has anybody seen 'er?

Nina, Nina where you been-a?

You're the prettiest girl

Leave.

OK, OK

You come downstairs,
and then we'll play

Excuse me.
Coming through. Sorry.

Damn, motherfucker,
watch yourself!

I am terribly...

You's a sorry-assed
motherfucker.

I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

Keep walkin', bitch.

I'll whup your ass up,
motherfucker!

I'll give you five dollars
to buy a new suit, punk!

Excuse me. I'm sorry.

He won't leave.
He's not tired?

I doubt he's slept
the past five days.

There's something else.
What?

He's rhyming now.

Rhyming?
Rhyming.

He's talking in rhymes.

It's very, very disconcerting.

Yo, Nina, Nina, I'm over here

And this is really good
if you give it a chance

I never even knew
that I could dance

I guess some people can
and some people can't

But I don't even care
if I splits my pants

We had a neighbor
who'd lose her mind sometimes.

What's weird is,
when she got that way...

she'd only speak in song lyrics.

Murphy, Feldman,
you're lookin' pretty beat

I thought you might feel better
with some ribs to eat

Eat 'em, gentlemen,
you'll think they're really fine

And if you want a couple more,
you can get 'em anytime

I'm incredibly frightened.

Hey-oh

Hey, hey, hey-oh

Hey-oh,
hey, hey, hey-oh

Hey, you sing, hey-oh

Hey, hey, hey-oh

Hey-oh

Hey, hey, hey-oh

Let's go, come on,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

Just bounce to the beat

Just bounce to the beat, yeah

That George Hamilton
sure can move.

Just bounce to the beat, yeah

I once knew a girl
named Peggy Sue

The only thing
that she liked to do

Was take the club,
get on the funk

All I did was jump and go

Hey, Lou,
look at that girl right there

The one with the weave
all in her hair

Just bounce to the beat,
yeah, yeah

Just bounce to the beat,
come on, come on

Tell that girl in the blue

What she got to do
to get with you

Come on, just,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

Just bounce to the...

Tell that girl in the big ol'...

Talkin' 'bout the firm

That is, that is,
that is, that is

My pops used to warn me

Never fall victim to the pornie

Keep the pussy tight

The... the... the pussy,
the pussy tight

The pussy... the pussy tight

That bitch

If I'm gonna fuck,
raise that dick

I whip my dick out... whu-whu...

When I whip out my dick,
I do my duty

Hey, guys!

The dick,
his dick, his dick

Plays that dick, that d-dick

I need some pussy

Some dick, dick

Senator Bulworth, sir?
The fund-raiser!

Some pussy, his dick,
some pussy, his dick

The Beverly Wilshire
fund-raiser starts in 5 minutes!

Senator, the brunch
begins in five minutes.

But are you up to speaking?

Up? What's up?

Perhaps Barbara Boxer
should talk.

It'll be fine.
Give me the speech.

Hey, Murphy, we had a good time.

You're very tired, sir.

Just give me the speech.

You girls want breakfast
at the Beverly Wilshire?

Where's Nina?

We could drop you at
that chicken and waffles place.

It's really yummy.
Have you ever tried it?

Where's Nina?

Nina said
she'd see you later, George.

I'm comin'.
Oh. OK.

I think it'll be fine.
He got it out of his system.

Don't worry.
I'll be fine this time.

You can get some sleep
at the hotel afterwards.

It's gonna be fine.

And freshen up.

OK, Macavoy.
Beverly Wilshire, chop chop.

You got nothin'
to worry about.

I'm tellin' you,
the man is a rock.

He looked in my eyes and said,
"This bill is un-American".

This man is granite.

Good. We're down 31/8, and
the bill's still in committee.

It never will get out.
Jay Bulworth's on this baby.

I'm sure all he needed
was a good meal and some sleep.

Senator?

Your speech, sir.

Go get 'em.

Hiya, Constance.

Good of you to show up.
Rough night at the prom?

We're back on track.

How's Edward?
Edgar.

I like Edgar.
I've always liked Edgar.

Knock it off.

Once in a generation,
if we're lucky...

an individual
whose life and work...

are the life and work
of the people he represents.

Such is the man
who has served the people...

of the state of California...

Senator Jay Billington Bulworth!

Thank you, Bill Stone.

We stand on the doorstep
of a new millennium.

We have an obligation...

on one hand, to reduce...

Ahh...

Yada yada...

Yada yada yada.

It's up to the people
to decide...

what the state of California
and the nation will do.

Biddy biddy bid...
Ooh, what'll we do?

The nation will do

It's up to you. What'll we do?

What'll we do,
well, it's up to you

You know, it ain't that funny,
you contribute all my money

You make your contribution,
then you get your solution

As long as you can pay,
I'm gonna do it all your way

Yes, money talks,
and the people walk

Yeah, now let me hear ya say it,
big money

Whoa! Big money, big money

Big money, big money, big money

One man, one vote,
now is that really real?

The name of our game
is "Let's Make a Deal"

Now people got the problems,
the haves and the have-nots

But the ones that make me listen
pay for 30-second spots

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, Bank of America
at this table over here

Wells Fargo and Citibank,
you're really very dear

Loan billions to Mexico
and never have to fear

'Cause taxpayers,
taxpayers take it in the rear

Take it
in the rear, take it in the rear

Yo, over here
we've got our friends from oil

They don't give a shit
how much wilderness is spoiled

They tell us
that they're careful

We know that it's a lie

As long as we keep drivin' cars,
they let the planet die

Let the planet
die, let the planet die

Exxon, Mobil,
the Saudis in Kuwait

If we still got the Middle-East,
the atmosphere can wait

The Arabs got the oil,
we buy everything they sell

But if the brothers
raise the price

We blow 'em all to hell

Boom boom boom boom

Now let me hear ya say it

Saddam
Saddam

Hussein
Hussein

Saddam
Saddam

Hussein
Hussein

Mmm

Get me a phone number.
Dr. Morris Fishman, UCLA.

He's at the Department
of Psychiatry.

Get the number now.

Yo, everybody
gonna get sick someday

But nobody knows
how they're gonna pay

Healthcare, managed care, HMOs

Ain't gonna work,
no, sir, not those

'Cause the thing that's the same
in every one of these

Is these motherfuckers there,
the insurance companies

Yeah, yeah

You can call it single-payer
or Canadian way

Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day

Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word

Socialism!

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now, the women in the world
is mistreated and abused

But when we try to fix it,
we tend to get confused

I got respect
from all the sisters

They will tell you
that's my style

But there's one thing
in politics

That always makes me smile

I like the pussy, the pussy,
I like it really fine

And when you be a senator,
you get it all the time

The young ones, the old ones,
they really like 'em all

And when you be in Washington,
you hardly have to call

The women, they love power

And if you don't
pull that rug out

No matter what they say or do,
they give you nappy dugout

MIMl: Now, would we be eligible
for an Emmy or a Peabody?

Will rap be
a regular part of your campaign?

A part of my campaign?

Now, that just sounds insane

Went well, don't you think?
Extremely.

Is campaign finance
reform your central issue now?

It's the only way to go

If these guys pay the piper,
then the piper does a show

You got that right.
Bye, fellas.

Wait in here.

I'll be right back.

Patricia Ireland
is expected in town.

Will you have a meeting
with her?

How does this approach sit...

with the National
Organization of Women?

Hi.
Hi.

That speech was phat.
"Phat"?

You got a room here?
Huh?

A room we can go to upstairs?

A room?
A room.

What do you want to do now?

We could proceed to
the church, then the debate...

or we can shut down
until the debate.

Dr. Morris Fishman
is in Paraguay.

It's your call.
My call?

It's my call?
I know it's my call!

Feldman?

Uh, Feldman?

Is Mrs. Bulworth
making the campaign swing today?

Yes, sir?

Uh, Feldman, could I
have the key to the room?

The room?
The room, upstairs.

Oh! Sure.

Feldman?
Yeah?

Key?
Right. Sorry.

You have no fear...

your big money sources
are gonna dry up?

What?

Senator Bulworth?
It's in the car.

The Senator needs his room key.

Senator, we have
to get in the car now, sir.

Key's in the car. Let's go.

Why don't you
get some sleep now?

Yes. Nina and I
are going up to the room.

That's not a good idea.
Yes, it is.

You and her right now?
Yes.

I've got a better idea.

You and I get in the limo alone
and circle back when you want.

Why would I do that?

Will the insurance industry
respond well to your remarks?

Senator,
where is the nappy dugout?

Where's the nappy dugout?

That's where you get the bug out

How are you gonna keep
the American Medical...

Who are the girls?

The girls?

They're friends of mine,
can't you see?

Feldman, Feldman,
where's that key?

The key's
in your hand. You got the life!

You got the life,
ain't it grand?

You got the life

Senator, how do you intend...

You got
to be a spirit, Bulworth.

You can't be no ghost.

You got it all, Bulworth.

Ain't life grand?

Ain't it grand?

You got the life, man.

Let's go, Macavoy.
We're on the move.

Give me the phone.
I need Davers.

You got to be a spirit,
not a ghost!

Macavoy,
you know where Davers is?

No, sir.

Maybe he's at our next stop,
the church.

You've had a crushing weekend...

This is
Eddie Davers. Leave a message.

You should get some sleep.

Davers, this is the Senator.

Once you get this message...

call the man you introduced me
to in Washington.

Tell him he has to cancel
the weekend research project.

It's very important.
See you at the church.

The church in Pasadena.

We can drop
the young supporters off.

Where can we take
you young ladies?

We rollin' with y'all!

Senator, a pleasure to see you.

Cardinal! Yo!

I hope Mrs. Bulworth
isn't under the weather.

No. She's fine.
I'll be with you shortly.

Y'all got a choir
in your church?

I'm with the network.

Find Davers.

The weekend research project
has to be canceled.

Macavoy, go in there
and find Davers.

I've got to find Davers.

Sir, a couple of questions.

The glory of his name

You see him?
No.

We are honored today
by the attendance...

of United States Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

Let us rejoice
in his presence...

and sing hymn number 376.

Joyful, joyful

We adore thee

God of glory

Lord of love

Lord of love

Hearts unfold like flowers
before thee

Get out of the car.
Why?

I got some problems,
and you're not safe with me.

What does that mean?

Just get out of the car.

You afraid of somebody?
Yeah.

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Thou our father

Christ our brother

All who live in love are thine

Teach us how to love each other

Lift us to the joy divine

If you're so afraid,
why don't you tell me why?

I can't.
I just need a guy to call a guy.

Call the guy yourself.

I don't know how.

Let's go back to the hotel.

You liked that hotel.
I gotta stay out of sight.

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

Kill 'em live

It is worse than arrogance.
It is contempt.

Contempt for the press
and for the people.

Have you heard a rumor that
Gephardt's looking for someone?

I'm staying out of sight
until he gets back.

We can wait in the car.

Hi, Mimi.
We lost our ride to the debate.

Can we catch a ride
with you guys?

He split with the limo?
Yeah.

So who walks in? Huey Newton.

You know who Huey Newton was?

A lot of people I talk to...
black, your age... don't know.

Huey.

Why do you think
there are no more black leaders?

Some think it's because
they all got killed...

but I think
it's from the decimation...

of urban manufacturing bases.

Senator, an optimistic,
energized population...

throws up optimistic,
energized leaders.

When you shift manufacturing
to the Third World...

you destroy
the blue-collar core...

of the black activist
population.

Some people would say
the problem is cultural.

But the media is controlled
by fewer and fewer people.

Add to that a consumer culture
based on self-gratification...

and it means nobody
wants leaders...

calling for self-sacrifice.

Fact is, I'm a materialist.

If I look at the economy...

high employment means
jobs for African-Americans.

World War II meant
lots of jobs for black folks.

That's what energized people
for the civil rights movement.

An energized,
hopeful community...

not only produces leaders,
but leaders they'll respond to.

What do you think, Senator?

What do you think my age is?

Your age?

You said black people my age.

Oh. 23?

Twenty-six.

How old do you think I am?

How old?

Hmm?

Sixty.

My mother was a Panther.

Huey Newton
fed kids on my block.

Huh.

Senator,
aren't you late for the debate?

Davers, Davers, Davers.

I've been looking for you
everywhere.

I'm here.

We have to call Vinnie.

You know what I get
out of this place? Bupkus.

Talk to you later.

Yeah?
Vinnie, it's Nina.

You a fucking bimbo?

I couldn't get him
up to the room.

You're incompetent.

You didn't
have to push him off.

You just had
to get him upstairs.

I've had it with you!

Vinnie, wait.

You move on to plan B.

What the fuck is plan B?

You know plan B.
And you better get it done.

You said if I got him up
to the room, I'd get 10 Gs.

Fucking bimbo!
Vinnie.

Vinnie! Davers.

The Senator
wants to speak with you.

Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie, my friend,
how are you?

Vinnie, I'm very relieved
to get in touch with you...

because we're gonna have
to call off...

the weekend research project.

Call it off?

That's not a problem, is it?
Not a problem?

My plans have changed.

But you keep the fee.
That's not a problem, is it?

No.

Oh, good!

Good, good, Vinnie.

Let me ask you a favor.

Can we keep this
just between the two of us?

You and me
and whoever's doing the thing?

We're gonna need a surcharge.

Fine.
Cancellation fee.

OK. Just keep the check.

No. An additional 50,000.

That's good.

I'll send Davers over right away
with another check.

Shall we consider it done?

Yeah.

Wonderful. Wonderful.

Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.

You're welcome.

Fuckin' crazy motherfucker.

Senator, what is
a weekend research project?

No, it's a... It's nothing.

It's all off.

That guy's nuts.

I don't feel too good.

Want something?

Vinnie.

You want something?

Vinnie!

I gotta go. I'm out.

All right!

All right!

We're late,
we're late, we're late!

For a very important debate!

And I'm feeling so great
while I'm feeling my fate

when I get to the gate...

Senator!

'Cause I got a new slate
on my plate and it's great

If you want to hide,
I know a place.

You think after all this crap
is over Tuesday...

that maybe you could
actually, like, hang?

Hang?
Hang out with me?

Oh, hang out with you.

What do you think?

Yeah.
Yeah?

I got the plan.
Want to meet my family tonight?

Oh, that would... That's great.

That's great, that's great

I got a whole new slate

I get to meet the family,
I can hardly wait
