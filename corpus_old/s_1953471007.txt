There we go,
make your momma proud.

Hey, Larry, let's go
play some catch.

Go throw the ball around.

Get your mitt. (PANTING)

Larry, get your mitt,
let's go throw some...

Let's go play some...

Jesus, Larry, you scared me.
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

Where's your...

Jesus, stop doing that.
You know I have a bad ticker.

Now, where's your baseball,
let's find your baseball.

Maybe it's under the...

How the hell did you
get under the bed?

Come on, Larry.
Let's find your mitt.

Where's your mitt? Let's stop
horsing around here,
and let's go throw the ball.

Where is that glove?
I don't see... What?

Okay. Oh, my God.
I'm on to you.
You crazy little fucker.

to me, Larry.

There's two of you.

I can't take any more.
I can't...


But I ran.

I ran so far away.

I couldn't get away.

(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

LARRY: How are
you doing?
What are you doing?

Just driving around,
filming people.

LARRY: How are you doing?
Stop.

Are you still here?
How are you doing?

(LARRY WHISTLING)

LARRY: How are you doing, man?
What's up?

How you doing, dude?

You get paid for this?
LARRY: No. For fun.

Are you in high school
or something?
No, 40 years old.

LARRY: Where are you going?
You're acting weird

LARRY: I'm not weird.
(GIRL SCREAMS)

(LARRY PANTING)

(LARRY WHISTLING)

Hey, buddy!
What did you bench today?

What the hell
are you doing?
Huh?

Get the...
Get out of here.
Whoa.

LARRY: Hey, Roger,
you wanted to see me?

Yeah, Larry.
You're fired.

LARRY: Okay.
So...

LARRY: How do you rate
our date so far?
Do you film everything?

Well, I wanted to
capture our first kiss.

Oh! Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

Oh. Really? Okay.

Oh, Jesus. Okay.
You all right?

Oh, my God.

I'm meeting my girlfriend's
parents for the first time,

and I just took the
biggest dump of my life.

It won't flush.
It won't flush.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

CINDY: Honey, is
everything okay in there?

Huh?


LARRY: Today's the day
my girlfriend moves in.

Hopefully she doesn't have
too many boxes.

Hi, honey! How are you?

Yes. Oh, God.


I think I lost the baby.

LARRY: What?
I think I had
a miscarriage.


Are you filming this?

Better.

LARRY: Okay, so this
is the house I inherited
from Grandma.

Those lanterns at the front
were from Paris. Stole 'em.

You know,
if you come over here,

I talked to a lot
of sculptors,

and

I wanted to capture
the moment that
I discovered masturbation.

That's a  <i>Playboy</i> I'm reading,

and a lot of times
my dog, Rex,

would watch me masturbate.

It got so annoying that
I'd have to climb a tree
just to get away from Rex,

because it made me creepy
that he'd watch me.

That is a desk

my grandma actually died at.

And we just kept it
the same way.

This couch was a find.
I had it in college.

Wiped the pee stains
out of it.

Oh, oh, these tusks are
an interesting story.

I was in Mexico and I was
drunk and I hit an animal
I didn't really know

what it was,
but I cooked it up and ate it.

And I think look
pretty darn good.

Bitch getting that
through customs.

This is our dining room.

Oh, this is a nice,
interesting piece.

This piece represents
the story of a small,
black child in the South,

a slave, making her way North
to safety in Harriet Tubman's
Underground Railroad.

Interesting.

This is the kitchen,

where we do a lot of stuff.

Over here is the fridge,
the refrigerator.

This is where we do a lot
of our product placement.

And come over here.
Oh, wait, go back.
And this is great.

This is an interesting thing.

Last night,

I cooked the best cheese
sandwich of my life. I put it
right up on top there.

And the cheese
melted perfectly.

The best thing I've ever had
in my life. This, uh...

That's my pig.

There's a paper mache
replica of my dog, Dog Byron.
Good guy.

And there's Cindy.

Hmm.

Watching her favorite TV show.

Hmm.

Here's the backyard.

A lot of party going on
out here. You bet.
We eat there, sometimes.

This is the pool
and that's the...

One-Eyed Willie
cleans the pool automatically.
Don't have to do jack squat.

That stop sign is
an interesting story.

I plowed into that.
Once again, drunk.

And rather than wait
for the cops, I took it.

This is our bedroom.

So this is where all
the paranormal activity
has been happening.

We've been hearing
a lot of loud bangs at night.


What was that?
I don't know. I just
banged on the wall.

Why'd the lights go out?

Oh, I had
scream lights installed.


They turn on and off
when you scream.

Oh, well, let's just be
really quiet and see
if we hear any odd noises.

Okay.


Why'd you
scream now?

I don't know.

Good thing I can't get you to
reach orgasm or our lighting
bill would be enormous.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)
(BOTH SCREAMING)

What is that?
What was that?

I don't know.
Something happened.

I heard something.

LARRY: What was that?
I don't know. (GASPS)

CINDY: No, it's okay.
It's just my keys.
LARRY: Oh, boy.

LARRY: Okay.
Did you hear that?
CINDY: Shh.

I mean, did you hear that?
Shh.

Tell me. (SCREAMS)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a lamp.

LARRY: Okay. Okay.

I heard that.
I heard something.
CINDY: Shh.

(LARRY SCREAMS)
CINDY: It's okay,
it's just Snooki.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Larry, what are we gonna do?
Something is really strange
in this house.

going to keep
on filming.

Then, when we know
exactly what we're
up against,

we'll be in the
perfect place to

take care of it!

Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

The battery's low.

Oh, no, baby.
(KISSING SOUNDS)

Looks like somebody...
You're so hot.

Oh, no. Something's wrong
with you. I don't know
what I'd do without you.

I don't know
what I'd do without you.

Mmm. These are great
green beans, Cindy.
Thank you.

Wait. Who are you?

Cindy refused to sleep
with the director,
so he killed her off.

I'm your new
girlfriend, Katie.
Oh, right!

(BOTH CHUCKLING)


Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did. What is it?

I don't know. It's coming
from the basement.

KATIE: Baby, I'm scared.
Don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be okay.

I've got a camera.

LARRY: Oh, it's
William Katt.
Hey, Larry.

I forgot. William Katt
lives in our basement.

KATIE: Hi, Bill.
Hi. How are you?

How could you
forget, man?
LARRY: I'm sorry.

Hey, Bill, I got a question.
Have you heard anything
strange going on?

We've been hearing
weird noises

and doors opening and closing
for no reason and stuff.

Could be gnomes.
Gnomes?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
gnomes. They're like
little leprechauns.

They get in through the walls.
They cause all kinds
of problems.

You gotta watch
out for them.
Okay.

Hey, do we have any strong
sedatives in the house?

Sedatives?
Yeah, I need

something that's gonna
knock a 400-pound woman
on her ass.

I've been keeping this girl
down in the basement

for about half a year,

and I feed her nothing
but 18 pounds of catfish
every day.

She's gotten so fat, she
can't even move anymore.

She's completely dependent
on me to keep her alive.

That's terrible.
Yeah.

But, you know, when
you've been as famous
as I have,

for as long as I have,

you've got to do whatever
you can to get your
rocks off, right?

What? Whoa! God damn it!
Look out! Look out!

Whoa!
What?

Did you see him?
LARRY & KATIE: What?

The gnome?
LARRY: A gnome?

KATIE: Gnome?
Oh, come on, Larry.

You didn't
see the gnome?
KATIE: No.

BILL: It was right there.

LARRY: I didn't see it.

You know,
I did a little angel dust
a little while ago.

I don't know,
maybe that's it.

I think you dropped
something, Bill.

LARRY: Yeah, you
dropped something.
What's that?

Is that...

KATIE: Is that a finger?

Oh... Oh, yes.

Yes, indeed.
That is a finger.


I won this off a Somali pirate
some years ago in a game
of five-finger fillet.

Little bastards. Not nearly
as good with the blade
as you'd think they are.

Okay. All right.
Going back down
to my basement.

Goodbye. Goodbye, Larry.
Goodbye.

LARRY: Good night.
BILL: Good night.

KATIE: Good night, Bill.
BILL: Have a good one.

LARRY: Have a good one.
Jesus!
BILL: God damn it!
Son of a bitch!

LARRY: Look out! Look out.
BILL: Fuck. God damn!

Watch out for
those little fuckers, man.
LARRY: Okay.

You can't be
too careful.
LARRY: Okay.

Okay?
LARRY: Yeah.

LARRY: Love that guy.

LARRY: Can we do
a sound test real quick?

I want to see how good
this mike is.
What should I do?

Just whisper something creepy.

(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

Okay. But this time
try to speak up. I'm
testing the mike here.

Okay. One more time.

(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

LARRY: Okay, go ahead!

(KATIE GROWLS ANIMALISTICALLY)

Wow! This mike is really
good. It's like you're
standing right...

(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

Okay. That looks pretty good.

Are you gonna
have that camera
on every night now?

We have to
if we want to
catch this thing in action.

All right. Camera man,
what do you think?

I'm flying a 12K par on a
condor and a couple of 650s

with CTB
for an ang light, nigga.

Where do you want me, sir?
What scene number
is this again?

What was that?
LARRY: I don't know.

Larry!


It's coming from here.

Wait! Composer?

Yes, sir.

Can I get a little
scary music swell
here, please?

Of course, sir.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

It's just a vibrator.

Why would it go off
on its own?

I don't know. Must have
some sort of timer on it.

Why would a vibrator
have a timer on it?

I don't know.

So you know
when to go

Hey, wait.
Why was that

Because, sir, the distributors
want you to maintain
a PG-13 rating.

So I can't say (BLEEP)?
I'm afraid not.

I can't say pig (BLEEP)?
No, you can't
say that either.

Well, what good does
it do in a scary movie
if I can't say pig (BLEEP)?

I'm sorry.

But the script
has a gnarly
decapitation scene

where a paraplegic woman
gets raped and
brutally murdered.

Yeah, and that's fine.
The MPAA doesn't care
about shocking violence

as long as you don't
say any naughty words.
I see.

I feel better.

What the (BLEEP)?

Okay.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

Yeah, just...

Wait. Whoa.
Where's the clown?

Oh, there he is.

Yeah, no biggie, right?

KATIE: No, seems
like a normal night.

You know, I was thinking
about calling a psychic
to help with our problem.

We don't need a psychic
for that. The pump I ordered
came in yesterday.

No, not that problem.

The problem with our
house being haunted.

Oh! I know a
great psychic
we could call.

He's a waiter at
the dim sum place.

He's always sticking
notes in my dessert.

What does it say?

"Cheer up,
it's only chlamydia."

There's a lot
of truth to that.
Yeah. A lot.

Listen, Katie, this is
a serious matter.

I don't think we can rely
on Chinese mumbo-jumbo.

Okay,
this is what we need.

You mind zooming in here?
I don't feel like getting up.

Okay. This guy's
been a practicing psychic
for over 500 years.

He even attended
a psychic retreat
in India for two weeks.

That's a
foreign country.
Yeah. Exactly!

For a one-time fee,
he'll not only
communicate with spirits,

but he'll also pop out
a dent in your car.

Okay. We're just waiting
for our psychic to arrive.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Look at that.
Perfect timing.

Not really. Wish that
would have happened
about 10 seconds ago.

But here we go.

Hi.
Hi, there, folks.

We are going
door to door doing
missionary work

for the Church of
the Latter-day Saints.

We'd like to share our message
of peace and love.
Here, take a pamphlet.

It just says, "Fuck the Jews."

LARRY: Oh, you know what?
We're already fans
of Mel Gibson,

but we appreciate it.
Thanks for coming.

Hold on a minute.
Hold on, Larry.
Hold on. Hold on.

These folks are
from the Mormon church.

The Mormon church,
right?
That's right.

Yes, yes.
We are.

Well, that is wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

I want to hear
all about it, all right?
Great.

Let's go down into
the basement, and we can
talk down there.

I have so many questions.
Great.

Okay, let's go,
all right.

Hey, let me ask you something.

Do you know how to
get semen out of cat fur?

'Cause I have been
trying for the longest time.

You know...
And I used baby powder
and detergent.


(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hi!
KATIE: Hi.

I'm Dr. Lipschitz.
KATIE: Nice to meet you.

Good to meet you,
too, darling.

So, why we're here.

You think something paranormal

is occurring
within this residence.

Yes, there's been lots
of odd things happening,

with wall noises,
doors squeaking,

lights switching on and off,
dildos turning on...

Yes!


You certainly have some type
of presence here. Nice pink.

(BUZZING STOPS)

What will happen
to us, Doctor?

Well, the events you
have been describing

are going to slowly get worse.

LARRY: Why?

Ghosts know formula.
Mmm-hmm. I mean,

for the first, like, 45
minutes, they'll slam doors
and whisper your name.

But then things will escalate,

and the last 10 minutes

should be quite compelling.

But, Doctor, why is this ghost
after us? What does it want?

Well, I believe Larry
knows the answer to that.
Don't you, Larry?

Larry?

LARRY: Well, it's true.

It all happened
when I was 15 years old.

I had an imaginary friend
named Toby,

and Toby and I would...
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

Oh, my God. If we're
going to have a
flashback moment,

somebody else ought to
be behind the camera.

I mean, really,
where's the dramatic effect

with you on the wrong side
of the lens?

He's got a point.
I'm filled
with points.

Well, yeah, this is...
This is better.

Um, okay.

It all started
when I was 14 years old.

My dad had just passed away
from alcohol poisoning.

He drank 144
non-alcoholic beers.

That's a gross.

KATIE: That is gross.

No... Never mind.

My stepdad used to like
to videotape me at night.

He even went so far
as to put a video camera
in my room.

<i>I could never figure out why.</i>

LARRY'S STEPDAD:
All right.
Let's have some dancing

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, yeah.
Oh, dance the night away!

Oh, get into it.
Go, Larry!

Yeah. All right.

It's bed time.
Why don't you
put on your PJs?

Yeah.

These ones?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not those. Not those.

Let's, uh,
put the training ones on.

Yeah.
This one?

Oh, yeah.
Oh, those are steamy.

Oh, you know, because
of the locomotives.
(CLEARS THROAT)

Because there's trains
on them.

LARRY:  <i>I had an</i>
<i>imaginary friend</i>
<i>named Toby.</i>

<i>And at night we would play</i>
<i>different games together.</i>

One hundred...

<i>I taught him how to play</i>
<i>hide and seek.</i>

Found you!

<i>He taught me how to</i>
<i>get high smoking catnip.</i>

Meow!

<i>I showed him how to</i>
<i>give cool handshakes.</i>

<i>And he taught me how to</i>
<i>autoerotic asphyxiate.</i>

<i>My stepfather had set up</i>
<i>a camera in our living room</i>

<i>mounted to an oscillating fan.</i>

<i>Mostly for his own amusement.</i>

<i>You know, looking back at it,</i>

<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>anyone would want to</i>
<i>document themselves</i>

<i>doing mountains of cocaine.</i>

<i>But, hey, that was my stepdad.</i>

<i>He had his ways.</i>


It got worse two days later.

My stepdad came into my room
to play a game of catch

and next thing I know
I was being questioned
by the police.

Apparently his brains
and his hemorrhoids
exploded simultaneously.

He died instantly.

And, you know,

I just knew it had to be Toby.



I woke myself snoring.
Excuse me.

KATIE: It sounds like
Larry was possessed.

Can you help us, Doctor?
I'm afraid I can't, Katie.

What I sensed when I walked
in here and what Larry
has now just confirmed,

this is not a ghost
we're dealing with, honey.

This is a demon.

What's the difference?

Well, a ghost will sell you
crack on a street corner.

But a demon will wash
your crack and sell it
back to you.

No, I'm sorry. That's
a drug dealer and a hooker.

This is terrible.
I know it is, Katie.

The jokes are stale,
the plot unoriginal,

but nothing
we can do about it, so...

I suggest we do what
Brendan Fraser does.

Take that money and run.
Maybe there's
something we can do.

Should we move
out of the house?

No, I'm afraid that
won't work either, Larry,
you see,

this demon is
attached to you,
so if you leave this house,

it ain't gonna
make a difference.

I suggest you stay here.

Plus, save you a bundle
on below-the-line budget.

Mmm-hmm.

Well, I mean,
should we try
to communicate with it?

I mean,
find out what it wants?

Hmm.

No, I don't recommend
that either. You see,

when you start to communicate
with this kind of creature,

you open the door for it
to come on in.

So we should just do nothing?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah. Absolutely nothing.
We should do
absolutely nothing.

And end the movie right here.

Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

Never mind. I got nothing.

No, wait, wait, wait.
There is an alternative.

Oh, yes. Here we are.

Okay.

Call him.

I don't know if he's any good,
but he is an expert.

I'll be outside
if you need me.

He took your dildo.
Yeah.

We should
call Jack Goff.

this is all happening.

Promise me you'll call
that expert tomorrow?

LARRY: I don't know, Katie.
It's only 45 minutes
into the movie.

Why don't we just wait
until things get
a lot worse?

What am I going to do
if something happens to you?

You'll probably marry up.

Listen, why don't we
just put all this
ghost business behind us,

at least for tonight, huh?

I like the sound of that.
But, Larry?
Yeah?

Remember what I told you
about filming me
when I'm on the toilet?

Only do it when
you're doing number one?
Exactly.

Larry, film us making love.

I want you to capture
our essence, our passion.

Our deepest, darkest desires.

I want to feel
like Kim Kardashian,

if only for one night.

LARRY: Oh, yeah, baby.
Yeah.

This is going to be the most
tasteful sex tape ever made.

Yeah.
Get ready to have
your world rocked.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

Yes.

Yes.


(LARRY GRUNTING)


LARRY: Ooh. Bad dog.

(KATIE MOANING)








DEMON: Oh, no,
you didn't.


(DEMON SIGHS)

DEMON: Oh! You mean
I can't say (BLEEP)?


KATIE: Larry!

LARRY: What is it? What is it?

LARRY: Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Look!

They've already pirated
the movie.

Fast-forward
a little bit.

What is this?

(COUPLE SPEAKING SPANISH)

It's like watching
a pirated version
of our lives.

It's a found-footage movie,

within a pirated movie

of a found-footage movie.

I don't get it.

It's April 14th, 2011.

We just got back from
the Justin Bieber concert.

And our house is
completely torn apart.

KATIE: They take anything?

Everything seems to be here.

I called the police department

and they said I should
just document everything
for their amusement.

Wow, whoever this was

they even trashed the script.

And wiped their ass
with it, too.

KATIE: Larry, come here!

What is it?

I can't find your
penis pump anywhere.

It's all that seems
to be missing.
Oh, damn it!

That was $19.95, plus $25
shipping and handling.

KATIE: I know!
That's where they get you.

Maybe Bill Katt
heard something.

LARRY: Hey, Bill.
Hey.

Hey, we were wondering
if you heard anything?

Well, I heard you
knock at the door.
That's why I'm here.

No, I mean earlier.

Well, you'll have to be
more specific than that, okay?

I mean, I have the memory span
of a sea sponge, so...

Okay, I'd say around 11:30.


Who the hell are you?

Bill, this is a disaster.
I mean, just look at it.

Certainly is. You should be
ashamed of yourself, man.

Haven't you heard
that godliness is
next to cleanliness?

You could mop my floor
with your tongue
and not get sick.

Believe me, I've forced
many people to do just that

and they're all in
spectacular heath, okay?

Bill, are you okay, man?
You've got blood all over you.

Oh, what?
This is beet juice, dude.

All right? I drink four cups
of it every day.

Keeps the
erectile dysfunction at bay.

Really? Okay,
I'll just remember that.

Look, I can't believe somebody
would break into a house
and not take anything.

You know what I mean?
Maybe it's not
even a person at all.

What are you
talking about?
Like gnomes?

Gnomes? Good God, man,
don't be silly.
It could be the Jews.

Jews?
Yeah!

You see a house, it gets
broken into, you immediately
suspect blacks, right?

You see, what no one
is thinking about is Jews.

Bill, I think we have
a bigger problem on
our hands than Jews.

Yeah, like what? Koreans.
Those little sneaky bastards!

No. No. A demon.
A demon? (HICCUPS)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING
IN DISTANCE)
What was that?

That's just something the body
does when you inhale baby
powder on an empty stomach.

Don't worry about that.

No, I mean those screams.
Oh, just don't
worry about that.

That's what they do
when they're hungry, right?

Mamby-pambies,
they can't go a day
without food!

Shut up!

Hey, I survived six weeks
in the Kalahari desert,

eating nothing but
the corns off my feet.

Okay.

We're done, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks.

You want something to eat?
I'll give you something
to eat, you little fuckers!

Holy crap.

(TRADITIONAL JEWISH
MUSIC PLAYING)

(SPEAKING YIDDISH)

Yeah, I think we'd better
call a security guy.

People don't take
security seriously.

Sure, they'll install
five or six cameras
here and there,

but you're not going to
catch anything with that,

other than maybe the top
of a burglar's head.

And maybe the love
of your life

cheating on you with some
handsome security guy.

Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did that happen to you?

That's okay.

I later killed the man
and stole his identity.

You need to
take safety seriously.

You should install cameras
in every nook and cranny
in this house.

LARRY: Well, how many
cameras are you
talking about here?

Oh, I don't know.

A place

this size,

I'd recommend at least

600.
600 cameras?

Isn't that overkill?
Overkill?

Was it overkill when
I called that security guy
for protection

and he didn't use
any when he fucked
my wife?

Cameras are all very small.
You won't even notice them.

LARRY: Okay, well,
we'll just do whatever
you think is necessary.

Necessary?

Was it necessary for me
to cut off that security guy's
balls and hang them

over my rearview mirror
like a pair of fuzzy dice?

LARRY: No?
No?

Did my wife say no when that
security guy told her to bend
over and take it like a man?

I like the couches.

<i>â™ª Tastes so good</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, this is</i>
<i>how we make the money</i>

<i>â™ª This is how</i>
<i>we make that cash</i>

<i>â™ª Since this movie's</i>
<i>out of money</i>

<i>â™ª This is how we make it fast</i>

<i>â™ª This is how</i>
<i>we make the money â™ª</i>

DEMON: Yeah!

You see how it goes down?

And now you see
how it goes up?

I can do whatever I want
to do with this fucking
stupid chandelier.


Let me see what
they have here.

Light beer.

All they have is light beer.

So sick of this place.

When I'm 18,
I'm so out of here.

Wake up, bitches.

I'm going to run
the water bill so high,
you don't know what hit you.

Maybe that will
teach you some lesson.


Come here,
little piggy.

I pick you up from here,
and I put you over there.

No bacon for you, bitch.

This place sucks!


Ah! I'm going to
smoke some weed.

Light up. Come on!

Yes. Bitch weed.


That shit kicks in fast.

(LAUGHING IN DISTANCE)

What's that?
What's that?

Hello! Is somebody there?

Hello!

Man, I'm freaking out.

It sounds like
just a series
of odd events to me.

I think you're
just overreacting,
Larry.

No, Sheila,
this would be
overreacting.

We got a goddamn
demon in our house!

No, that's overacting.
And you're good
at that, Larry.

Larry, get that
out of the pool.

Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is
all in our heads.

Doesn't it feel better
just to say that?

Yeah, it does.

I mean,
Larry's got
a vivid imagination.

I guess it just
rubbed off on me.

(GROANING CONTINUES)
You're going to be fine.

Sheila, what would I
do without you?

You make everything
seem like it's going
to be hunky-dory.

LARRY: My tit!
It will. I promise.

It's sucking my tit off!



I think I have to pee.

DEMON: Ah,
what have we here?
Angel from heaven.

something tonight
to remember, baby.

Ah, yeah. Sucky, sucky.

Yeah.
Titty-titty-bang-bang.

Hmm.

(DEMON GRUNTING SUGGESTIVELY)

(SHEILA SCREAMS)

What is that?


DEMON: Oh, yeah.
(ERUPTIVE SOUND)


(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

I told you,
you can't be cheap
with toilet paper.

You gotta go
at least two-ply
or people freak out.

DEMON: Yeah, motherfucker.
Oh, you like that.

Your pool is gonna
be dirty as shit now.

Algae's gonna build up,
your pH level's gonna
be so fucked up,

you won't know what to do.


(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
Take that, bitch.

(LOUD THUDDING)

Larry! Larry,
what's that?

What was what?

That!

That's just
the demon, honey.
Go back to bed.

Larry, I'm scared.

Well, then go down
and check it out!

You're the man!

I expect you to investigate
creepy sounds. Come on!

God! Ow!

Larry!

All right!

Boy, first you want
the vote, then you
want equal wages.

Why don't you go
down and check out
creepy sounds?

Larry.

Do you have to
bring the camera?

LARRY: Yes, I do.

Hey! What the hell?

LARRY: Hey, what are you
doing in here?

I'm making a
found-footage film.

LARRY: No, I'm making
a found-footage film!

I was doing it first.

Well, mine's a spoof!

Well, I was making spoofs
when you were pooping
your diapers, you little fart.

Besides, I starred
in a Zucker film.

I starred in a Zucker film.

Look, get out of my house.
Get out of my movie.

That doesn't count.
You get out of my movie.

Get out of my movie!
Get out of my movie!

You get out of my movie.

Get out of my movie!
You get out of my movie...

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Did somebody call
for a demon hunter?

LARRY: I don't think so.

Well, with the economy
being in the toilet, I was
sure hoping to find a job.

I'm so happy you're here.
We haven't slept all night.

Well, you know what you
should do is take a
light walk before bedtime.

It boosts serotonin levels
and promotes relaxation.

LARRY: Is that some sort
of ghost hunting tool?

No, it's a cell phone.

I got a new app that
locates Christian singles
in the neighborhood.

There's a real cutie
about four doors down.

Catholic girls
like to do anal.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Yeah. I think your place
is definitely haunted.

How can you be sure?

I've got a sixth sense.

You can see ghosts?

No, but I can communicate
with household pets.

Your goldfish is
definitely depressed

and probably seen a demon.

What can we do?

Well, he could do with
a little of this.
There you go, fishy.

She should be better in
the morning. That's for sure.

Yeah. She'll get much
better in the morning.

Where's my manners?
My name's Goff.

Jack Goff.

LARRY: Ah. Nope, no way.

My friends call me Jack.
You can call me Jack.

LARRY: What do
your enemies call you?

Inmate 2571044.

But that's in the past,
God willing.

Listen, I don't mind you
filming me, but I'm not going
to sign any release forms.

Ever since I did  <i>Corky Romano,</i>
<i>I've been a little cautious.</i>

LARRY: How do we proceed here?

I'd like to walk
around a bit.
Get a lay of the land.

LARRY: Have you ever
done this before?

Walking? Sure. Ever since
I was three years old.

I'd like to think
I'm pretty good at it.

LARRY: No. Demon hunting.

You hear that?

No.
LARRY: No.

Neither do I.

Quick! Go to night vision.

It's going to make it seem
a lot more suspenseful,

when actually
I'm just gonna monolog
about my history.

I've been hunting ghosts
and dealing with the
paranormal for years now.

It all started
way back when,

when I auditioned
for this reality TV show
and I landed the lead.

I thought you looked familiar.
You were on that show
<i>Demon Hunters.</i>

One and the same.
26 episodes.

Yeah, they had me
going all over the world.

Chasing down ghosts
and haunted houses and such.

LARRY: I thought
that stuff was bogus.

There's nothing bogus
about a 2.7 ratings share
on a Wednesday night, sir.

Yeah, we made it all up.

Yeah, after three years
of pretending to hear doors
creak and ghosts talk,

something really
strange happened.

LARRY: You started
hearing them for real?

No. We got canceled.

LARRY: Oh, I'm sorry.

It's all right.

Yeah, I got pretty
depressed here for a while.

Kept hearing voices
in my head going,
"You're an idiot, Jack.

"You're a loser, Jack.

"You're a loser. Loser.
You're a loser."

At first, I thought
it was my intuition.

But then my intuition
was telling me
it wasn't my intuition.

It was a demon.

So ever since then,
I've been using
my powers to...

Help all mankind?


To try to build
an audience back,

so I can get back
on a reality TV show
where I belong.

Jesus.


It senses me.

Oh, it senses me,
all right.

Yeah.

You feel that?

It senses me, and it
doesn't like what it...



Didn't spill a drop.

I'm okay. I think we should
check out your bedroom next.

So is this the room where most
of the disturbances happen?

Yeah. A lot of them
do happen in here.

Yeah. Yeah. I can feel it.

I'm feeling stuff.

It's kind of like
a tingling sensation.
Who's that whore?

LARRY: What?
That's my Aunt Linda.

Yeah. I'm feeling,
like, a heat.

Kind of a tingling,
tingling feel.
I don't know.

Oh! They like to possess
stuffed animals a lot.

You know what,
that's my grandmother's.
Can you not...

Pop. Pop.
Hey!

Get over it.
She's dead.

She's not dead.

She will be.

All right. They like
to creep into walls
sometimes.

Feel them out.

LARRY: What is that thing?

That's a, uh...
It's an imaging, uh...

You hear stuff with it.

It's a hearing device.

It looks like
a stethoscope.
LARRY: Yeah.

It's getting warm.
It's a warm kind
of a feeling that I...

You know what,
can you not...

It's okay, Katie. I'm a
professional ghost hunter.
You know what...

Oh, ho, ho! Bingo!

Look what we got here.
The possession of a vampire,

Count Juggula!

LARRY: You know what,

I don't think that's
appropriate at all.

All right. Jeez,
I was just kidding around.

All right, where's your
bathroom anyway?


Got a little dribble.


Yeah, I'd wash
that if I were you.

All right.
LARRY: You were
in there for a while.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Focus up.
Let's get to work.

All right, let's do
a little peeping.

Got anything? Nothing.

Hope I didn't lose him.

Nothing there. Damn it!

Where, oh, where could you be?

Oh, yeah,
I'm getting something.

Yeah, it's big.
It's real big.

I'm getting a rod.

LARRY: All right,
that's enough!

Hey, man. It's cool.
We're cool, right?

LARRY: Yeah. Come on, Goff.

JACK: All right. This is
what's called
a thermal imaging camera.

Let's just scan
the area for anything
out of the ordinary.

How does this thing work?

JACK: I got no ideas.
I just like the pretty colors.

Just stand over there.
Let me get a reading.
Okay.

Right here?
Okay.


Good God!
I got a reading.
I got a reading.

What? Where?

Jesus.
This thing's amazing.
What? What do you see?

God dang it!
I lost him.
I lost him.

Wait. Wait.

I think it's trying to
communicate with us.

Well, okay,
what is it saying?

I'm not sure.
The message may
be too advanced

for our feeble human
minds to comprehend.

Ah, damn it! I lost him.
We know where you are,
you son of a bitch!


I brought in a cognitive
psychologist

to help relate to your
demon you got there, Larry.

I'm Dr. Luni.
But you can call me Ima.

Ima Luni.

Sounds like you're the guy
I'm here to see.


Pretty hot for a doctor,
right, honey? I mean, wow.

KATIE:
Larry, get to the point.
Right. No.

So tell me what
you're seeing.

Yeah, you know.
I've been living
in the house.

It's just been weird that
all of sudden I get
taken over by a demon.

I think it's got to
be a demon,

'cause it makes me
say stuff and do things
I would never do.

But it takes over me
and I don't know
how to stop...


This is the demon
inside of Larry!

And he's thinking
that you're pretty hot,

and maybe you,
Katie and me could go out
to dinner and drinks sometime

and maybe get to know
each other and
fool around, I don't know.

Whoa, God! It happened.
It happened.

What did it say?

Nothing. He just
introduced himself.

Oh, that's... That's weird.

Usually he's
a lot more forward.

He's a demon,
he's kind of a dick...
He didn't say anything?

Nope.

Get the cotton out of your
ears, you dummy!
I'm talking about fucking!

I'm a demon, let's get
it on. You, me and Katie!
Come on, baby.

I can fuck all night,
I can fuck all night.

Whoa, man. Oh, boy.
Felt that one.
That was a big one.

What'd he say?

He gave me a recipe
for chocolate chip cookies.

Cookies?
Yeah.

Oh, that's bizarre.

Weird. Sometimes he says
stuff that's really rude.

I'm talking about a
threesome, you dumbass.
I'm talking about me...

I'm talking about a foursome.
Me, you, Katie and you.

We all get it on.
We'll go upstairs
and watch dirty movies,

get in the bathtub,
put some hot lotion on us.

We can jerk it and suck it
and fuck it all night.

Sticking fingers in holes,
you get it front side,
I'll get backside,

up top and we're going
to get to town and...

Whoa. My goodness.
I got possessed.

I think I had your guy!

No, I don't think you did,
because she's the doctor and
I know it doesn't jump people.

No, it does.
I'm a demon hunter

and this one, I think he was
Italian and really strong.

No, I don't think it was,
'cause I don't think...
My demon...

The fuck are you doing, Goff?
Get the hell outta here! This
is my thing going on here.

Why do you have to be
so selfish all the time,
for God's sake?

I'll just sit in the corner
and whack off.

What the fuck?
I don't want to
see you whack off!

My dick won't even
touch your dick!

I don't wanna see
your fucking dick!

Wait! Stop! Enough!


(DEMONIC VOICE)
Oh, my goodness!
I'm going to hit you!

I'm going to fucking kill you,
you fucking psychos!

I fucking can't stand
the two of you!

I'm going to fucking pepper
spray both of you!

Whoa.

What just happened?
That was so weird.

I feel like I was possessed!

What did I say?

BOTH:
You said you wanted
to have sex with...

Me.
Us.

No, me.
Us. All of us.

(BOTH GROANING)

My demon has a big dick,
did I tell you that?

Shut up, Goff.

KATIE: Nice one, guys.

That was a bust. Jeez.

Hey, I was possessed.
Well...

I was possessed.
Yeah. Me...

KATIE: Sure, Larry.

I was, Katie.


We still got, Katie.

We could probably get
a threesome going.
Shut up, Goff!

Come on, jeez.

Well, that was a bust, huh?
Sorry.

KATIE: Can we please figure
out how to talk to this demon?

Hey, you want to put
a sock in it, hot pants?

Big boys are talking here.

Whoa, hang on a minute.

All right, all right.
Sorry about that.

All right, listen.
Demon! Demon!

Demon, I'm trying
to communicate with you
right now, listen up!

Um...

I know you're a supernatural
being and probably
prefer to communicate

through grunts or
unidentifiable noises.

So let's keep this simple.

One grunt means "yes,"
two grunts mean "no."

How does that sound?

(DEMON GRUNTS TWICE)

Okay, I think I just got
a "yes" and another "yes."

This is going great.
Okay!

We're on a roll here.

Demon, um...

Can you see us?

(DEMON GRUNTS)

All right. This is great.

Demon, are you
the only presence here?

(DEMON GRUNTS)

All right.

Demon, have you been
with Larry all his life?

(DEMON GRUNTS)

Oh, okay.

Hey, Demon, have you
ever, like, sharted?

DEMON: Uh-huh.

Oh, man, I knew it!

I shart all the time.

I sharted on the way over
here, that's why I asked,
'cause my underwear is full.

KATIE: Enough
with the sharting.

All right, honey,
I had a question,
okay?

Why don't you just
let me talk to him?

Hold on a second!
Let me talk to
him for a second.

Hang on.

What is it that
you want from us?


What was that?
KATIE: Something
fell in the kitchen.

JACK: Maybe he's trying
to communicate with us.

LARRY: He wants us to
use the Louigi board.

What's a Louigi board?

Well, it's just
like the real one,

but we don't have to
get clearance from Hasbro.

It's working.
It's working!

"I."

Write this down.
Write this down. "I."

Are you moving it?

"A."

"M."
He put an "M" in there.

You know what, Larry,
can we get a crossfade
on this thing?

'Cause it's
taking a long time.

"D." Put a "D" down.

What does it say?

"I'm extraordinarily bored."

Huh?

God damn,
you're black-hearted,
Demon. Come on!

Quit playing games!

LARRY: Well it is a game.

What do you want
from Larry? What?

Answer us!

Put your hands on here.
Let's get this done.

"Y."

Hey, Larry, can we just
go montage? I'm getting
kind of tired here.


Oh, no! The demon
killed Grandma!

ALL: Oh!


I get to go to hell!

ALL: Yay!


The demon says
I'm an alcoholic!

ALL: Whoa!


The demon gave me herpes,
and I gave it to you!

Herpes!


You shut your fat faces!
Why am I angry?

We shouldn't be playing this.

ALL: Louigi!

JACK: "E." All right.
Jeez, what do we got?

Looks like a poem.

"Winter wind of death blows,

"love smells sweet,
soon we'll be one."

What does that mean?

LARRY: That's not a poem.
That's a haiku.

That's not a haiku.

Guys, I took a class
in college, okay?

For it to be a poem,
it has to rhyme.

LARRY: Good point, honey.

My nose is running.

That's a poem.
Shut up!

Okay, what this poem
is trying to tell us...
Uh, haiku.

Shut up.

This poem is saying
there's one thing for
certain that this demon

is in love with you!

LARRY: Get out of here!
What are you talking about?

No, it is.
It's in love with you.

Read between the lines.
Look at it.

It's saying it wants you and
nobody else to have you!

That is why he's been
with you your whole life.

That's why you killed
your stepfather!

How'd you know that?

I saw the first half
of this movie.
Any good?

Eh...
Well,
what you're saying is...

What I'm saying is,

we've got to kill this
demon before it kills Katie.

Here! Dramatic effect!

Zoom in on Katie's face
for this one.

We've got to kill this
demon before it kills, Katie!

Okay,
how do we kill it?

We kill it with this.

Booyah!

Your demon exists
in a completely different
plane of reality,

but with this lens
we got right here,

oh, yeah,
this lens focuses
kinetic energy

emitted from all kinds of
different objects in the view

and then focuses this energy
with a phased array
of infrared detectors,

and elements,
thus transmitting the
electromagnetic pulses

and allowing us
to view alternate
planes of reality.

So that's what you got.

And we'll be able
to definitely see your
demon in the flesh.

Flesh...

That's what I got for you.

I have no idea what
you just said to me,

but I know you've
been drinking all day.

What? Are you
a drink counter, boy?

No, I'm saying
you're an alcoholic.

Yeah, yeah, I already
got a mother, so shut it.

LARRY: This looks
exactly the same.

What are you
talking about?

It's all blurry right there
and the edges are blacked out.

LARRY: Check upstairs.

We gotta go
this way then.

LARRY: Okay, you see anything?
Nothing yet.

LARRY: Okay, if you see
something, just give me
a tap on the fanny.

What? No.

Oh, look out!
Look out!

Leave my bitch alone,
Jack-me-off!


JACK: What was that?

LARRY: It's a scream light.

It's gone. It's gone.

Where the fuck is it?
Where'd it go?

What was that?

I don't know.
I don't...


Suck the devil's dick, bitch!


(JACK SCREAMING)

LARRY: He shivved you!

The little bastard.


LARRY: Wow! That's...
KATIE: Larry!

LARRY: Whoa.

JACK: What happened?
Are you okay?

Oh, my God! What?

Are you okay?
You're...

Are you okay?
Do I look okay?

I just got shivved
by a demon up there!


Okay, okay.
I got one last idea
for you two.

What?

Run. Run.
That's what I say!

I'm used to TV show blood.

This is my blood.
Real blood. Ugh!

Too real for me.
I'm out of here. Goodbye!

Larry, I think we should
get out of here.

Nah, I think we
should stick around,
see what happens.

Okay.

Want to go to bed?
Yeah. Sure.

(DEMON GROWLING)

I can't sleep with
that demon growling!

Neither can I.

How are we going
to sleep, Larry?

I'm going to call
Dr. Conrad Murray.

Hi, Conrad. It's me.
Yeah, we need you.

Can we get some
of that Propofol...

Of course.
Great.

Thank you.

Wait!

I don't care what they say,
you're a good man.

Time to pay the piper.

(SNAPS FINGERS)



Where am I going?

It's like you're possessed.

Oh, no,
I'm lactose intolerant!

My God.

KATIE: Oh, my God.

That looks delicious.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

That's just really

gay.

Yeah, I'm

trying to come up
with something clever
to end this scene

and, uh, I got nothing.

Okay, let's just never
watch that again.

LARRY: Katie! Katie!

What? What?
LARRY: Help me. Help me.

What? What's wrong?
LARRY: Something
happened last night.

What happened?

LARRY: Something happened.
KATIE: Come here.

I got branded.
KATIE: Oh, my God!

The demon branded me
with a gun!

Oh, my God, Larry.

It's a gun!
It's not a gun.

Larry, that's a...
That's a penis.

What are you talking about?
He branded me with a gun!

It hurts, Katie! Look at it!

I'm looking. Babe,
that's definitely a penis.

Look at it.
Now stop it!

I'm looking.
Stop it!

It's a handle and a muzzle.

It's balls and a shaft.
Stop it!

Stop it now! It's a handle
of a gun and a muzzle.

Stop it. It hurts.
Balls and a penis

and the shaft with
a mushroom head.

Katie, that's a silencer!

Get out of here!
God almighty!

You don't even know.
Larry, I'm calling a priest.

Why would a demon
brand a penis on you?

Call a priest, but
tell him it's a gun.

It's definitely a penis.
I've seen a million of them.

Larry, it has pubic hair.

You don't know what
a gun is? It's a gun,
it's a gun like this.

I've seen a gun,
and I've seen a penis
and that is a penis, Larry.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

I wonder who this could be.

Oh, no, no, no. We already
said we don't want any.

Oh, wait! Do you
people do exorcisms?
We need a priest.

No, I'm sorry, you need
the Catholics for that.

We could use your
help, though. We're
missing some of our flock.

LARRY: Chickens?

Mormons. Surely,
you've seen them.

They were last seen
entering your home.

Uh, no,
it doesn't ring a bell.

Here, have a look.
It's in the script. Page 35.

Oh, yes!
Now I see. Yeah.

They were downstairs talking
to our squatter, Bill.

Actually, I prefer
house guest.

I have a question. Let me
ask you all something.

If you were stranded on
the ocean, dying of thirst,

would it be better to drink
sea water or your own urine?

Now, think about it,
think about it.

Let's go down into
the basement and
we'll discuss it.

Okay? Come on.

Thank you.
Okay.

It would be urine, right?

I'm going to
call right now.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Thank you for calling</i>
<i>the Catholic Priest Hotline.</i>

<i>For English, press 1.</i>
<i>For Latin, press 2.</i>


<i>If you are male and</i>
<i>under the age of</i>
<i>eight, press 1,</i>

<i>and a priest will be</i>
<i>with you immediately.</i>

<i>If you or a loved one has</i>
<i>been possessed by a</i>

<i>Your call will be answered</i>
<i>in the order it was received.</i>

<i>Current wait time</i>

LARRY: Must be busy.

Should have called
on a school day.

<i>Please enjoy some music</i>
<i>while you wait.</i>

(OMINOUS CLASSICAL MUSIC
PLAYING)

The priest said he'll
be here as soon as he can.

Good. Good. Good.
We can't risk falling asleep.

I have to stay up
all night long.

Oh, goody! Look, there's
a marathon of  <i>Glee</i> on tonight.



What was that?

I don't know.
I'm gonna go
check it out.

No. Don't, Larry!

Don't worry about it.
I've got this special lens.

I'll be able to see the demon
if it comes anywhere near me.

That makes sense.
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

(WATER RUNNING)

(DOOR CREAKS)

Bill?

You there?

Bill?

Bill, are you here?

Larry.

Thank God you're here, man.
Hey, have you seen my socks?

No, but I have heard noises
coming from down here.

Oh, don't mind that.
That's just my
Mormon centipede.

Did you say Mormon centipede?

Yeah, I operated
on those Mormons,

I created a being connected
through their gastral system.

Mouth to anus.

They're right here.

(ALL GROANING)


I was so bored,
I started to improvise.

Oh, not this again.

Well at least I'm in
the front this time.

LARRY: Bill, come here.
What are you doing, Bill?

Why would you go do this?
Why would you do
something so terrible?

Well, I like Legos,
Larry, and I couldn't
find any, all right?

We're not talking
about Legos here, Bill.

We're talking about
that monstrosity!

I don't know why
I do the things that I do.

I mean, why does anyone
do anything, for God's sake!

I don't know.

When you've lived
a life like I've lived,

growing up with
celebrity parents.

I've been on Broadway.
I've worked with Fosse

and Brian De Palma.

I've done  <i>Carrie, First Love,</i>
<i>Big Wednesday, House,</i>

<i>Greatest American Hero.</i>
<i>It all just gets</i>
<i>so freaking dull, okay?</i>

So incredibly dull!

Dude, I've traveled
the entire world.

I've gone from Los Angeles
to Orange County.

I've taken cyanide,

I've driven a bus off
the Malibu freeway.

None of it interests me,
man, all right?

None of it!


Oh, good for you, man.
Good for you!

You made me say it!

Blood no longer runs
to this part of my body, okay?

So, yeah, I'll surgically
alter a group of Mormons.

Or I'll swallow a rubber duck,
just to see the look on
the X-ray technician's face,

but none of it interests
me, man, all right?
None of it!

I understand, Bill.

Do you?

No, actually.
No, not at all.

But I do have something that
might be right up your alley.

How would you like to help
me destroy a demon?


Destroy a demon?
That's right.

Hey, a demon destroyer?
Uh-huh.



Larry, you just gave me
the first natural hard-on
I have had in 15 years, dude!

That's awesome.
'Cause this guy's caused me
a lifetime of despair.

Haunted our house,
possessed me through my anus,

and now I'm afraid he's going
to force me to kill Katie.

Okay. What's your plan?
I don't got one.

Well, then
it's a good thing I do.

All right, what is it?

Okay, the first thing
we're going to do,

we're going to
get you possessed.

Party time!
Twinky, twinky.

Winky, winky.


You go down, Bill! Go around!

Get that bad guy!


God damn, I'm funny.

Go get 'em.

Hmm.

(LARRY SCREAMING)

Sorry, guys.
Almost forgot the camera.

Larry!

Larry, you okay?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

KATIE: Who's there?
Father Berkowitz.

Thank God you're here.
Father Berkowitz, thank you
for coming.

My boyfriend.
He's possessed.

Don't worry
your little tuchus,
sweetheart.

We'll take care of
the fakakta demon

and I'll even do three more,
if you have them,

but for the price of two.
That's a good deal, right?

Oh, could I turn the heat up?
It's a little chilly.
My neck gets stiff.

KATIE: Sure.
Hope it's not costly, though.

'Cause you know...


(KATIE SCREAMING)

The bastard demon
shivved me, God damn it!

Miss, I know I'm dying, but
could you pay me anyway?

I'd like to have it.

My mother warned me
not to convert.

Stay with your own kind!
Those Catholics...

Hello?

You know all the
cameras I set up are
kind of pointless,

if you don't lock
your door!

Ma'am?



Disappointed!

Hi, girl, hi! We've come back
for another party, y'all.


I think that guy
just stabbed me!

He just stabbed you?
He totally just stabbed me!


(ALL SCREAMING)

Jesus Christ!
Now he stabbed me!

He just stabbed you, too!

Yeah, he stabbed me, too.

Oh, my God. He just
stabbed us both!

That is not cool, Shakira.
Totally not cool.

Seriously.

I think there's a dead guy
on the floor right there.

Oh, he's deader
than this party.

Ew! Let's just leave
this whole scene.

Yeah. We're out of Audi.

See ya, wouldn't
want to be ya.

Ow. It hurts getting stabbed.
It totally hurts, right?

Guys, I'm here for
the threesome.

No?


(BOTH SCREAMING)

Oh, my God.
You just stabbed me.


Guys, I just need
one more shot.

KATIE: Is that Ted Striker?


He shivved me!

He shivved me!

Surely you can't be serious.

KATIE: Who's that?

Is that Tom Sizemore?


KATIE: Oh, my God.
Hello?

It's Quinton
from  <i>The Blind Side.</i>

I played Big Mike.
KATIE: I love that movie.

I heard some commotion.
Just, I got your back.


Said I got your back.


This is some bullshit.

KATIE: I love Sandra Bullock.

(LARRY SOBBING)


Damn it!
Just had these done.


Fucking bitch.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(DISTORTED HUMMING)

Hey!

Why don't you pick on someone
in your own universe, Demon?

Yeah. I tell you what.

Why don't you and I
discuss this over a brewski?

Come on,
sit over here with me.

You like beer, don't you?

Uh-huh.

So tell me, why do you
want this guy so bad?

Well, I don't know.

I mean, really. I've taken
shits that are more
interesting than him.


Wouldn't you want someone
with a little more flavor?

Someone with
a little more pizzazz?

Someone in the top thousand
of IMDb's STARmeter.

Mmm-hmm.

I tell you what.
I know you're bored.

Why don't you and
I get a little weird?

Just you and me together.

That's right. Look over here.
Right here. Now open your
mouth nice and wide.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Whoa! What happened?

Larry, you're back.
Oh, Katie!

His plan worked.
Bill saved you.

He's the best squatter
a guy could ever have.

KATE: Bill?

LARRY:
Where are you going, Bill?

To the moon, Larry!

To the fucking moon!


What a guy.

Bye, Bill.
Bye, Bill.

This movie is gonna go
straight on the fucking DVD.

(CREW LAUGHING)

This fucking sucks! You're
looking for a theater release?

No way!

I fucked your tusk and
you didn't even know it.

Bunch of fucking losers!

(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

More found footage.

Crap.
