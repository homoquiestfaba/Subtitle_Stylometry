[woman chanting]

[church bells tolling]

Need some more picks
and shovels in here!

Watch where you're going!

Do you see this?
Come here! Come here!


Raoul! Come with us
for a celebration.

Where are you going, Raoul?

You must come to the mine
for the celebration.

[Man speaking Spanish]

[loud bang on window]

It is very selfish of you
to steal from me.

Yes?Yes.

After all,
did I not promise to share
the treasure of the temple

with the whole town?

Do not kill me, SeÃ±or Diaz.
I beg you.

Take the treasure.
Please, just don't kill me.

I'm not going
to kill you, Raoul.

May God bless you.

You are.

Please, SeÃ±or Diaz.

I have a wife
and a child.

I can't.

Do as I say!

[Woman crying,
screaming in Spanish]

Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

[Baby crying]

You must choose, Raoul.

You die alone,
or you can have company.

I know what I
would do if my boy Luis
was being threatened.

I'm sorry.


[baby crying][woman screaming]

[crowd chanting,
playing music]

Celebrate!

Celebrate, my friends,
my town.

This is my gift to you.

Together we have uncovered the
tomb of the Goddess of Death.

And today,
on the Day of the Dead,

we will reap the rewards
of our discovery.

So, celebrate. Enjoy!

[speaks Spanish]

Enjoy! Enjoy! Yes!

[speaks Spanish]

Enjoy the celebration
that I know you will remember

for the rest of your lives.

Every remaining moment of it.

[speaks Spanish]

[church bells toll]

Maybe we should stop
at a filling station, Thomas.

Honey, the farther south
of the border you go,

the cheaper the gas.

Oh, for heaven's sake.

I just don't want
to get stuck out here

in the middle of nowhere.

We won't.
Scout's honor.

Por favor, gracias.

Good job, Ricky,
you're learning Spanish.

Thank you, prostituta.

What did you just call me?

That's enough.
Will you stop it?

I'm getting a migraine
and you're making it worse.

I'm just trying
to learn Mexican, Mom!

Leave him alone.
He's studying.

Did you hear
what he called me?Not now, Lily.

Listen to your mother.

Why do you always
take his side, Mother?

I think
you know why, Lily.

That sign says there's a little
town up the road a piece.

I think we should stop.
We're almost out of gas.

Yeah.

Hey, maybe we should get a room
for the night, you think? Huh?

I'm so tired,
I can barely keep my eyes open.

Good. I've seen enough desert
and cactus to last a lifetime.

I can't wait to see you
on that beach.

Eww.

There, Tom.
Thomas, right there.

I see. I see it.
I'm not Helen Keller, you know?


Hey, a motel.

All right.
Let's unload.

I told you so.No, you didn't.

Yeah!That is enough!

You did not!Lily, Lily...

What?Enough. Stop.

Thank you, Daddy.

Hello?

Anyone home?

Hello?

Maybe in there?

Hello?


Hello?

Habla ingles?
We would like to check in.

[bell ringing]

Daddy, make him stop!

All right, Ricky,
that's enough.

Now, you're even
giving me a headache.



Did you find anyone?

Well, there's a cleaning lady
in the parlor

and I guess it's her mother
in the dining room

and neither one of them
speak English.

Well, for heaven sakes,
what is wrong with these people?



[speaks Spanish,
distorted]

[continues speaking Spanish,
distorted]

You are not just gonna check
yourself in, Thomas.

You can't do that.

Well, I'm not gonna wait around
for someone to show up

so that we can give 'em
our money, if that's
what you're thinking.

Well, that's strange.

What?

Well, the last person
that signed in

was back in '47.

Well, maybe they don't use
that ledger anymore.

Oh.

You could
get arrested, Thomas.

Really?
Well, I'll tell you what.

If we do, we just bribe
the policÃ­a.

That's what they do
down here in Mexico, you know.

You're so square, Daddy.

That's so
completely prejudiced.

What?Saying you'll just
bribe the policÃ­a.

You wouldn't say that
if we were home.

Not now, Lily.No, it's terribly wrong.

Really. I think you owe
all Mexicans an apology.

Really?

Well, I'll tell you what.

If I ever see one,
I'll apologize.

Hey, son.

Follow me.

Up here, I think.

Numero cinco.

You and your brother
are going to share this room.

There's only one bed, Daddy.

I'm 19 years old.

Couldn't you have stolen
another key?

Listen, princess,
we're going to have to pay
for these rooms eventually

and I'm not going
to pay for three rooms
for a few hours' stay.

It's just too expensive,
and anyway,

we'll be on the road
first thing come sunrise.

Cheapy SeÃ±or Cheapstein.

Hey.What did you just
call your father?

Just the greatest dad
in the whole wide world.

That's what I thought.
It's time for bed, young man.

We'll see you
in the morning.

Ah, yes.
Number five.

Good night, princess.
Thank you.

See you, sport.

Mother, we're here.

I can't believe you talked me
into going to Mexico
for vacation.

With the kids, no less.

It's Ricky's first week
out of the hospital, honey,

after beating
that damn polio.

I know. I just--

I wanted it to be special.

It will be. Promise.

So...

The kids are in bed.

Wanna make love?

[loud creaking]

It sounds like there's
someone else in here

and they're even noisier
than you.

I'm gonna take
a bath, Ricky.

I'll be back
in a few minutes.

Oops.

Hmm.

Ahh.

[water gurgling]


How could you come
into the bathroom

when I was taking a bath,
you little brat.

You think you can get away with
anything just because you're...

My diary! How dare you?

Ricky White,
you're horrible.

I wish you had died
in that hospital.


[distorted growling]

Daddy!

[Lily screams]

SeÃ±orita!

There's a boy-- a boy upstairs,
who's hurt badly.

Please,
he needs our help!


Help me!
Help me, please!

There is this woman...

She had an accident.
A small boy--

He just came up and I--



[Lily screams]

[speaking Spanish]

[Lily screams]

[car horns blaring]

Banana chips.No banana chips.

Nuts, peanuts, almonds...

Um...peanuts.


Can I have some more?You're picky.

I am picky.

You're picky.Thanks, babe.

I have to pick out
the fruit for you?You do.

You don't like the nuts, you
don't like the banana chips...

Picky!


So, okay.

Are you sure you're right
about this whole thing?

'Cause I don't really do well
with first impressions.

Like when I interviewed
for my college entrance exam,

I spilled iced coffee all over
my interviewer's shirt.

And P.S., she was wearing
a white T-shirt, no bra.

Got her to turn on
the headlights, if you
know what I'm saying.

You know,
you will be fine.

Nah.No, they'll love you.

Nah.Yes!

Really?Yes.

Well, you love me,
I get that, it's just,

from what you tell me,
your parents are like
really traditional,

you know,
like really old school.

I know their type.
I-I know their type.

They're gonna
be sittin' there thinking,

"No one's ever good enough
for our little girl."

You know? Especially not
a little gringo like me.

Okay, will you just
stop worrying?

Just be yourself and they will
adore you, just like I do, okay?

You do adore me, don't you?Yes, I do.

What do you
adore about me?Everything.

Every little last thing?Yes.

So, where we at, where we going,
where we been, what's going on?

Yeah, um, are we still
on El Camino Real?

I'm gonna have to assume so,

because every road in Mexico
is El Camino Real.

El Camino Real.
El Camino Real.

Lots of old roads. Why do they
have so many old roads?

No new roads in Mexico?

El Camino Nuevo?

It looks like there's a town
about two miles up the road.

We can stop
and ask there.

Yeah?Yeah.

What? About why everything's
El Camino Real?

No.No?

About how to get to my parents'
new ranch from here.

Oh! Right, right.

Yes.

We are never gonna find
a gas station out here.

No kidding.
Not to mention a freaking--

Joss! Joss!Oh, shit!

[car horn blaring]

Are you all right, babe?Yeah. You're bleeding.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

Are you okay?

Are you okay, lady?
Oh, my God!

[speaking Spanish]What the hell happened to her?

Who did this to you?
Who did this to her?
What the fuck's going on?

[speaking Spanish]

Oh, my God, we've got to
get her to a hospital.

It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

[car engine sputtering]

Fuck! I saved up
for a year and a half for
this fuckin' piece of shit!

Joss. Joss,
you'd better come over here.

I have to find
the police or the sheriff

or the magnificent
fucking seven...

Joss!

What?Come here!

What is that?

What does that say?

What--What does that say?

"They cut out my tongue
so no one can hear my screams."


Okay, um,
I'm gonna get the police.

Hola.Uh, hola.

Um, do you, uh--
do you speak Eng--

Okay. You, uh,
"speako" English?

"Speako?"

Yeah, uh, fuck, do you--

Uh, English...

What seems to be
the trouble, son?

Oh, you do. Okay, good.
Okay, we were in an accident.

Uh, you really gotta help us.

We were driving into town
and we almost ran into
this funeral procession

and this lady spilled out of
the coffin they were carrying.

We weren't going that fast.

And she had
her tongue cut out, so...

I'm gonna need
to see your I.D.Okay, yeah.

All right,
which of you two young ladies
is missing a tongue?

Her.

Yeah, I know, I know.

Her name is Esmerelda,
Sheriff.

Esmerelda.

Well, now, Esmerelda, I don't
know what happened to you,

but I want you to know that

we're gonna make sure you get
the very best of care, okay?

You two are lucky.

A lot of crazy shit goes down
here on November 1st.

I'll just take care
of our little girl here

and the two of you just drag
that coffin out of the road.

I got a bad wheel.
All right. That's it.

Hey, Sheriff?
It's, uh--

What about our car?
It's totaled. Can we rent one?


Rent a car?Yeah.

There's not even a mechanic
within a hundred miles of here.

Are you kidding?

I'll hold onto
your driver's license.

We'll see about getting you
out of here tomorrow.

There's a hotel across
the street. Just ask for Oleta.

Don't fight me now.

Santa Bonita.

We'll just wait here, then.It could be worse.

I guess this turned out
to be the scenic route
to my parents, then.

It's quaint,
I'll give you that.

Hello?

Uh, hello?

[rings bell]

Hola. Como esta usted?

Por favor necesito...

Easy, now.

Easy! Easy.

Very good, sugar.

Now, you'll be safe in here.


Oh, Lily.

What are you doing here?

Oh, just need a room.

We have no rooms.

You-You-You have no rooms?

Okay, right now, I'd settle
for a broom closet, honestly.

You've got some seriously weird
people running around.

I've had a really rough day.
If I was you, I'd lock
that door.

I'd bar the windows--Is there a problem?

You did bar the windows. Que pasa?

You need just one room?

Yeah, just the one room.

Room five.

Dinner will be served
promptly at 7.

If you're late,
you will go hungry.

Okay.

Thank you. I think.

[Old Woman hisses]

Just one moment, please.

Yeah, weird.

Oleta wishes you
to have this.

It is a holiday.

She wishes you to celebrate.

What holiday is it?

November 1st. Ours is a town
of old ways and customs.

Many of the people
have gone away.

A few have stayed,

but not many.

Joss, it's DÃ­a de los Muertos,
the Day of the Dead.

What?

It's the day our people
believe the dead return

to walk the earth to see
their loved ones once more.

It's an ancient
tradition in Mexico.

That may be true in other towns,
but not here, Alicia.

Oh, no.

That is why
you must--[bell rings]

If you'll excuse me.Yeah.

Okay. Nice.

So...
[clears throat]

1892.

I wonder if it's
a good year for wine.

We'll find out.We'll find out.

Nice.

Oh, man, can you
believe this place?

How creepy. I feel like
I'm in the Haunted Mansion.

[spooky voice]
"Of course, there's
always my way out!"

[sinister laugh]Okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop.

Yeah, this place is
definitely a little freaky.

A little? Yeah, well,
yeah, definitely.

Like, a lot freaky.

Lady downstairs was like,
"Sorry, there are no rooms
available."

And then says, "Well, no, there
actually are some rooms left."

This shit hole
has nothing but empty rooms.

Who cares? Let's just get
the hell outta here.

I'd love to get
the hell outta here.

Well, you heard
what the sheriff said, babe.

The car's not gonna be ready
for another day, so--

Forget the sheriff, Joss.
Maybe we can call my parents.

They are gonna be so pissed
at me for being late.

Wait a minute. Your parents
are gonna be pissed?Yeah.

You know what?
I have a better idea.

Can you hold that?

Ah, two bars.Who are you calling?

Huh?Who are you calling?

Ah! What up, homeboy?
Ha! How's the O.C.?

Of course.Uh-huh.

Yeah, is it really,
really pretty
with all the pretty people?

It's a'ight.
Dude, check it out.

Me and Alicia were on our way
down to visit her parents

down here in Mexico,
and we ran into a...

into some car trouble.Car trouble?

If I tell him
what actually happened,

there's no way
of him coming down here.

Okay.So, let me lie.

We're partying.
Of course we are.

I don't know, bro. We're
drinking like really good wine.

We're chilling out.
It's pretty tight.

You wanna come down?

This place you've probably never
heard of called Santa Bonita.

Yeah.

No, no one speaks Spanish.
It's all English.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

So, what's up, dude?
You gonna come down?

Tyler? Tyler?

"Day of the Dead Cell Phones"
is more like it.

And my charger's in the car,
which sucks.

Hmm.So. Um...


Are you gonna
take a shower?

Why? Do I need one?

I-I'm just asking.


This wine is really strong.
I'm seeing three of you now.

Oh, really? Lucky you.

Yeah.

See you when you get back.

Mm-hmm.

[water running]


[bathroom door opens]

Joss, I just saw something
in the bathroom--

a reflection
of a little boy.

It was really
fucking creepy.

I mean, he was there
and then he was gone.

Of course
you saw shit, babe.

You had like half a bottle
of wine from 1892.

That shit
doesn't mess around.

I really, really
wanna get outta here.

I mean, this place is fucked up
and these people are crazy.

I know, babe, I know.
Don't worry though.

I'm not going to let anything
happen to you, okay?

The sheriff has taken Esmerelda
to get medical attention,

and we're in this
really creepy hotel,

waiting for Tyler and Erica
to come pick us up.

So, we just have to figure out
some weird way to kill time.Something.

Do you know of any
good way to kill time?I don't know.

I'll tell you one thing.What's that?

I am going to be
so happy to see Tyler for once.

Why do you have it in
for him so bad, anyway?

I just don't like the fact
that he sleeps around on Erica.

Well, it probably doesn't help
that she's a vacuous bimbo,

but still...

I think it doesn't help
that she's a cheerleader.

And you hate cheerleaders.[giggles]

You really, really do.
Don't you?

Just a little bit.
Yeah, okay, maybe a lot.


What's vacuous mean?

Empty-headed and shallow.

Who's empty-headed
and shallow?

Erica.

Hey.

What?

What time is it?

Do you remember me
telling you

about a little boy
in the bathroom?

Yeah. Of course.

I-I, uh-- I listen.

I just dreamed about him.

Um, is this your way
of telling me you want kids?

I think it's a little
early in the relationship,
but you know, if...

Look, babe,

we both had a lot to drink
on an empty stomach,

which, in retrospect maybe
wasn't such a great idea,

but it's dinner time,
and it'd be a good idea

for us to get
some food in our stomachs.


[indistinct voices]

Did you hear that?

At least we're not
the only ones here.

They can't have disappeared.

They're probably
playing a prank, right?

How hard can it be

to find a teenage girl
and a little boy in this town?

[Woman yelling
indistinctly]

Yeah, I told you there was
a little boy in the bathroom.

And I bet Esmerelda
is their daughter, Joss.

She's no runaway.
She was probably kidnapped.

I better go
and talk to them.


Doesn't anyone knock here?

Ricky! We've been worried
sick about you.

And where's Lily?

Where is she?[loud banging]

Hey! Get away from my son!
Get away from him!

What are you doing?
Ricky, what are you doing?



[Woman screams]

[screaming continues]

Are you all right?

I want to leave, okay?
I want to leave now.

Something terrible
happened here.

Yeah, babe, I know.

Well, I want to leave too,
but we can't.

Don't worry.

Tyler and Erica
are on their way down.

They're gonna be here
any minute, all right?

Tell you what, babe, hey.

How about if I go get
our bags out of our room

and we'll just go downstairs
and get something to eat
and wait for 'em.

Yeah, okay.Okay?

Maybe I should have something
to eat. Calm my nerves.

Okay. Yeah.
That's a good idea.

It's a nasty habit.

I'm sure it's killing me.

But I just love
the way it tastes.

It's kinda
like eatin' pussy.

You know, some guys...

Some guys get off on the way it
makes a woman feel, you know,

it gets her all moanin'
and wiggling around.

But I love the taste of it.

I love the taste
when I get my tongue in there.

You're probably wonderin'
why I'm telling you all this.

See, I been

dying a little death

a long, long time.

You, on the other hand...

you're prettier
than most of 'em.

But you're Mexican.

And we've got to have a Mexican
to keep those bastards
in their places.

Comprende, mi amor?

You Catholic?

Well, you better start saying
your pre-death shit,

'cause we're about to finish
what we started.


What? What's that?

Cat got your tongue?


Nope.

I got it.

That is not for you.

Sit over there.

All right.

You're the boss.

Uh, could we get some menus?

I have what I have.

If you don't want it,
you don't need to eat it.


You know what I love
about this place?

How warm
and sociable everyone is.

When we get home,
I'm gonna write to AAA

and have this place
declared a four diamond resort.

Not three, four.Stop it.

What?They're gonna hear you.

I don't care.
It's not like we're ever
coming back here again ever.

'Cause this place is, you know,
not-coming-back-to-able.

Would you care for
some more wine?

No.

Mescal?

No.What's that?

Tequila.No.

I guess she doesn't
understand that in English--

Help me! Help me!

There's nothing here.

You ready for weird?

No, I think I've had
enough weird for one day.

They're all over the place.

Must leave 'em around
like Bibles.

That is for you.

It speaks
for those who cannot.

[bell ringing]


Whatever creeps you got,

I think it's contagious.

Got a little time left
so I can get her ready.

Oh, shoot.

We got a little problem.

Looks like we're gonna need
another Mexican.

The last three pages
have been ripped out.

Maybe they're back
where I found it.

What the fuck is this shit?

This isn't like any DÃ­a de los 
Muertosaltar I've ever seen.

Really?

[distant moaning]

Hello?

Nothing.


Okay, shh!


Fuck!


Got you, baby.
Happy Halloween!

You guys are fuckin' assholes.
Seriously.

A little shaky today,
are we, Joss?Yeah, that's not funny.

You two look like
you just saw a ghost.

A few too many, in fact.

Are you ready to go?Let's get out of here.

Wait, go?
We just got here.

Yeah, we're exhausted.

We've been driving
the last couple hours.

We should spend the night here
and go in the morning.

This is a lovely town
you found here.

'Cause I mean, really,
who needs running water?

Yo, man,
we saw your car outside.

Looking a little extra toe-up
than usual.

Yeah.

You know what?

You guys really did
get here fast. Thank you.

That's because daddy
bought my baby a fast,
expensive little car.

Wish I had
a daddy like that.I don't think you understand.

There is something about this
town we really don't like.

Joss didn't tell you what
happened this morning.

No, Joss didn't tell us
what happened this morning.
What happened, Joss?

Some fuckin'
freaky-deaky shit, man.

No, really, it was...
You don't feel like driving?

I'm happy to drive if it means
getting out of Dodge tonight.

There was a funeral
in the street.

This woman-- her tongue
had been sliced out.

Oh, her tongue
had been sliced out.

Yes!Okay, yeah, that is
pretty freaky-deaky.

I'll say.
Freaky-deaky.

But listen, we're fried.
We got wine, we got food.
Nobody to bother us.

Truth be told, man, we're just
glad to get out of the dorm.

The whole place smells
like booze and spooge.Nasty.

And this place--
it's not that bad.
What do you think, babe?

I think
it's kind of romantic.

Romantic, if your idea of
romantic is the Overlook Hotel.

The what? It's just a little Shining
reference, babe.

You know, "Overlook Hotel,"

Jack Torrance,

"Here's Johnny."

What?Really? Wow.

Her idea of an old movie
is pre- American Pie.

No shit.[Erika]
Shut up!

Yeah, um, listen, guys.

Um, I'm gonna get our bags.

I'm gonna go
put 'em in the car

and we can
talk about this later.

I'm sure there's some other
hotel in some other town.

This one's not gonna cut it.

Don't mess up my car.

Don't...Don't go out there.

Babe, it's gonna be okay.

I gotta tell the sheriff
we're splitting anyway.

We'll be back tomorrow
to get the car.

That's all I get?We got some more where
that came from. L'chaim.

Yeah.


You are a catch.I know.

What the hell
do you see in him?I know! It's crazy!

It's crazy!It's crazy, right?

It's crazy!Crazy! You are hot.

You're hot, smart,
and creative I think...Mm-hmm.

You speak, what,
five languages?Five languages.

Five languages.Five.

And what,
I barely speak one.

English, Spanish, French...

English, Spanish...

Okay, babe.Shut up!

You're drunk.I am not.

Are too.Am not.

[glass smashes]

Oh!Am too.

What's this?

Ojaldra.

Sweet bread made by Oleta,
for the festival of the dead.

I hope you enjoy it

Muchas gracias.

English, Spanish, French,
Mexican, Italian...is that five?

Let's see what we got
going on here.

English, Spanish...

Mmm, this is some
good shit, right here.

Yo, taste this.
This right here,

with a little chocolate syrup,
a little whipped cream...

I was thinking,
more like hash but, you know.

Hash ojaldra.

You might have something there.

Hash ojaldra.

How much carbs
do you think is in this?Oh, you look great.

It doesn't matter how many
carbs, eat it. Go ahead.

No. Not until I see a label.

Babe, it's homemade.

They don't make
labels here, okay?

Plus, it's rude if you don't
eat it when they offer you
something. Right, Alicia?

Well, I guess, when in Rome...
just be in Rome.

Mm-hmm. Some good shit
right here.

You should
really have some.Okay.

I'm just not gonna have any of
that zillion-proof wine with it.

Careful of the bones.

Fuck!

Shit!

We are out of here now!

Hey! Hey, guys.
Tyler! Tyl--

Fuck! Erica!

What the fuck? Shit.

[fires gun]

Hey! Where the fuck's Alicia?What?

Alicia!
Where the fuck is she?

Uh, I don't know,
I don't know.Shit.

That fucking bitch put something
in our food, you guys.

What the fuck?

Take this, and if
she comes back, make sure
she never leaves your sight.

Don't trust any of those
townspeople. They're in
on whatever's going on.

You're buggin' out--Do what I say!

If she gets back, get in
the car and honk the horn.
I'll come running.

All right, I need the keys.

Wait. Where are you going
to look for her?

There.

Whoo!

[crowd yelling, chanting]

Oh.

Excuse me,
have you seen Alicia?


The girl who was
here before. Alicia.

Adonde esta Alicia?

Muerta.

Muerta.

[crowd yelling, chanting]

Alicia!

Alicia! Alicia!
Wake up, baby!

Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back!

Back up!

Drop the knife,
motherfucker.

Drop the knife!

You drop that
fucking knife.

Now!

Oh...

Thank God.

Thank God you still
have your tongue.


Now look what you've done.

They're gonna come
for you now.

Just like they did Lily.

You should have
let me finish.

Without a sacrifice,

those bastards will
come back out of the ground.

Oh, you have no idea
what you've done.

She hasn't been satisfied.

What the hell
are you talking about?

Now you're all gonna die.

I could have stopped them,
but it's too late.

It's too late!

I tried to do what
you told me to do, Oleta.

I tried!

I tried!

Not yet!

Mother.

[growling, moaning]


What are you doing?
What are you doing?

Fuck. The keys.
Tyler has 'em.

Tyler!

Tyler! Let's go.
We're leaving.What's going on?

Are you okay, babe?
We're leaving! Give me the keys!Here.

Let's go!

Come on!

Shit, they've got
the car surrounded now.

I don't think those are
the people from the church.

Look at them.[Joss]
Who the hell are they?

They'd better not
damage my car,

Shut up, Erica!All right, guys,
let's get back inside.

Before they see us. Come on.
Erica, Tyler. Let's go guys!

[all moaning]

I'm gonna go check
this door and upstairs.All right.

I'm okay.You're okay?

Wipe this shit off of me.

Joss, I'm gonna
go upstairs and secure it.

Okay.Give me the keys.

Are you okay, babe?

I'm okay.You all right?

Yes.Hey. Hey, hey.

Thank you.

Okay, babe.
I don't have enough bullets to
deal with all those people.

I'm gonna run
to the sheriff's office
and grab some more bullets.

Okay? Babe?

I'll be right back.

I'll be right back.

Joss! Wait.[opens door]

Give me the gun.
I can cover you.

I'm fine.
Give me the gun.

Okay.

You ready?

Go. Get back!

What the fuck?

Hello?

Hey!

Exc-- Hey! Hello?

Esmerelda?
Esmerelda, is that you?

Hello?
Are you-- Are you okay?







I don't like this.

What's taking Joss so long?

Stay back!

I'm warning you!

Shit![groans]

Fuck!

I'm gonna go get Joss.

Are you crazy? No.

I'll be fine.
I'll be right back.

I promise.

I'll be right back.

Joss!

Hey, look,
y'all need to stay back!

Look, I don't want no problems
and neither do you.


[yelling indistinctly]

Back the fuck up!

Oh, shit!

Tyler, get inside! Now!

Come here, dog!

Tell me I didn't see
what I think I saw.

Help me move this![Joss groans]

[all moaning]

What's going on, here?
What is going on?

Shit! I need something to
sterilize this wound right now.

Hurry up, please!
Did it bite you?

Yes! What the fuck
does it look like?

Bit me like
I was a fucking Big Mac.

It fucking hurts!

Calm down, relax.
It'll be okay.

This shit is deep.

You knew!

You knew and you
didn't say anything.

Those plates on the windows,

they're to keep
them out, aren't they?

Aren't they?

Okay, we've got nothing.

What's out there?I have no idea.

They looked like dead people and
those things wouldn't go down.
Lower this leg.

I shot one of those
bitches three times
and she wouldn't go down!

Calm him down.
Alicia, help me move this couch.

We've gotta block
the other door.Joss...

You don't think the bite--If this was a movie,
maybe yes,

but in real life,
I have no idea.

I don't have no heart
to kill him,

and if he starts turning,
you don't either.

Let's just stop talking
about it and block
the other door, please.

Hey, guys...

We should go upstairs.You're right.

I think we'll be
safer upstairs.

Come on, let me help you
upstairs, dog.

Wait, what are you doing?

What are you
talking about, babe?You can't take him upstairs.

What if he turns
into one of those things?

Erica, are you serious?

Yes, I'm serious.
You just said it yourself.

He's been bit.
He could be infected.

Do you wanna
take the chance?


She's right. She's right.
We can't take that chance.

We can't take that chance.

Yes, we can.
We are not gonna do this.

No, no, no, no.

She's right.
She's right. Really.

I can't risk turning
into one of those things.

I can't risk hurting
one of you guys.

So, just leave me
here with the shotgun.

Leave me here with the shotgun
and I'll hold down
the fort, okay?

So, just leave me here,
you guys.

You can't do this!

Baby, baby...

It's the only way unless you're
prepared to kill me yourself.

Go on.

Coming?

I'm staying here with him.

Alicia, stand by your man--

normally, very noble.

I get it, okay? But right now,
you're asking for death.

And Tyler and I need you with us
if we're gonna survive.

I was with you,
until you decided to abandon
my boyfriend to those things.

What do you think?
Daddy's gonna come
down here to rescue you?

We are in this together.

And the minute we all start
to turn on each other,
we are finished.

You're just a coward
when it comes down to it.

Daddy's scared little girl!Okay, you know what?

Coward? Really?
Fuck you! Okay?

Tyler and I are here
because of you.

And this is
the thanks we get?

You didn't tell us
what was going on.

You didn't
say a goddamn word.

We are here because you
and Joss were selfish!


Joss, we gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on, dog.

Come on!

We don't have time for that.
Here, take this.

Ah, there you go.[Joss screams]

[moaning, shrieking]

Don't move.

They're not by the car anymore.
We could run for it.

Joss can't run on this leg.
It needs to be treated.

Well, we've got
to do something.

Hold on, buddy.

Fuck.

Let me sterilize
the wound with alcohol.

Martia said there
was mescal downstairs.
I'm gonna go find her.

Alicia, be careful.

Look at me. Look at me.


I thought you said
there was mescal here.

Look carefully.

You will find
what you need here.

All I see are a bunch
of creepy art projects.

The past determines
the future.

Cut out the fortune-cookie
wisdom, okay?

It's getting a little old.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

You wanna get me
some more hot water, babe?Sure.

Hey, man, I'm all right.
I'm getting a little--

I'm getting worried
about Alicia.Relax, relax, big guy.

Who's the doctor here?

Doctor? You've been in premed,
what, three months?

You sure you know
what you're doing?Hey, you lucked out.

I almost went pre-law.
Hold this for me.

All right.Squeeze.
This is gonna hurt.

All right, one more.

[water sloshing]

I saw blood.

Blood stains everything
in this house

and this town.

We should talk to them,
let them know about the danger.

We must do more than that,
Alicia. You must...

[bell rings][gasps]

I must go.Wait!

Come on, Alicia,
I need the alcohol.

Goddamn.

Hang on. You know
what I mean?

[turns faucet off]

You okay?

You all right, babe?

What's wrong?


I'm so scared.

Come here, baby.
It's okay.


Trust me.

Just be strong, please.
Just keep going.

I love you.

[moaning loudly]

[Joss groans]

You're all good, bro.

See anything out there?

[electricity surges]What the fuck?

Are you kidding me?
Are they in?

They're not inside. They
probably just cut the power.

Look, I'm gonna
get some matches, okay?

How did they get at the wiring?
What the fuck do those things
want out there?

[Tyler ]
Whatever it is, they either
want us or something in here,

because I don't see 'em
banging on anybody else's door.

Maybe they just like
white girls.Fuck off.

You never stop, do you?[chuckles]
No.

I can't believe you two
are laughing.

I had a chunk taken out
of my leg and I'm still
enjoying myself.

We gotta do something,
you guys.

I agree, but we're
surrounded in here.
Not much we can do but wait.

Well, sitting around
waiting to die isn't so much
a plan, it's suicide.

I've got something else
in mind, so get the shotgun.

Come on.

Here you go. Be right
back now, all right?

Hey, Tyler, thanks.

No doubt, man.

Alicia, check that door,
make sure it's secure.

I'm gonna make a run
for the car.

I'm gonna pull it right up
to the front door. Through it
if I fucking have to.

Are you crazy? If anybody's
going out there,
it's gonna be me.

Why? 'Cause you're
a big, tough guy?

No, tough girl. 'Cause
I don't want you out there
risking your life.

When, what? When you
could be risking yours?

It's a very good answer,
but it's not gonna fly,
all right?

Besides, you're the only one
who knows anything
about being a doctor.

So, just keep the testosterone
in check, okay?

[zombies moaning]

I'll go, Erica.
I got you into this.

You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for Joss and me.

Don't remind me,
but you don't know how
to drive stick

and now's not really
the best time to learn.

I'd rather be out there
than in here.

So, I'm going.
That's that.

Plus, I got the keys, so--

I hope you're as good
a shot as Joss says, because
once I get out there,

I'm gonna need you
to hold those guys back
or I'm not gonna make it.

Holding down your back,
baby. Don't worry
about that.

Tell Joss that I'm sorry.You can tell him yourself
in the car.

Okay. Are you still
mad at me?


Take this.
You're gonna need it.

Let's go!

All right, look,
on the count of three,
open each door.

We're just gonna
go out blastin'. Erica.

What was that for?

Luck.

Could have put
a little tongue into it.

Three, two, one!

Ah, hell no!
Go, baby, go, go!


Yes, she made it!She made it?

[growling loudly]

Good to meet you.[grunting]


Guys, I need some backup!

I'm clearing the way for you,
baby! Don't stop running!
Go! Go! Go, baby!

[zombies scream]

Come on,
let's go back inside.

[zombies growling]

[zombie groans]

She's coming around.
Here. I'm gonna go get Joss.

Wait, what about Martia
and the old woman? We've gotta
take them with us, too.

That's too many people.
We can't fit all of them.
It's just us. That's it.

Okay, you know what?
You go, get help.

I will stay here with Joss and
protect those people until you
can bring back the Federales

or whoever can take care of
whatever those things are, okay?

You sure?Yes, I'm sure.

All right. Let me move
this out of the way.

I'm gonna go help Erica.

[horn honking]

On three, now. Lock the door
behind me, all right?Okay.

One, two, three!

[zombies roaring]

Oh, my God.

I love you.


Put me down!

[bones cracking]




Nothing. She's just sitting
at the end of the street.

What's she waiting for?I don't know, Joss!

All right, babe.
It's just a question.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just...

You just didn't see
what happened. I watched Tyler
die right in front of me.

It's okay. It's okay.

If we can just make it
through the night,
maybe they'll go away, right?

'Cause tomorrow
the Day of the Dead's
gonna be over with.

And they'll just...
go away, right?

Right?

I'll be back.


Tyler, come here. Tyler.

[flesh tearing][screams]

Tyler, don't!

No, please, please!

Please, please, please!

Martia, I need to know
what the hell is going on

in this godforsaken town
of yours.

You are right.

God has forsaken this town.

All that is holy
has no place here,

and your boyfriend
was partly right

when he guessed I knew
what was going to happen.

I also prayed
and hoped for it.

Sit down.

What is all this?

I don't understand.
How can all this be happening?

How can she know the future?

Over 150 years ago,

this town was first settled
by the Diaz family.

They owned the land

and employed
most of the laborers
who worked here.

One day,

Vargas Diaz's workers
made the most incredible find.

They had found 
an ancient Aztec temple--

the shrine to the lady 
of the dead herself, 
Mictecacihuatl.

The temple was filled with gold 
and jewels of such a value

no man could put 
a price on it.

Vargas believed the Goddess, 
in return for his sacrifice,

would reward him 
with his greatest wish--

immortality.

Diaz put everyone
in town to work

while offering to split
his unimaginable wealth

with all those who helped him 
work the mines.

But first, he would have to 
deal with the town sheriff,

his oldest friend, Martinez.

What is this?A going-away present.

Going away?

I don't think so.

You've already
taken my wife.

I won't let you take
my daughter as well,
SeÃ±or Diaz.

Choose, Martinez.

Do you want to leave
here breathing,

or in a pine box?

You must promise me, Vargas,

that you will never
set a hand on her.

Martinez,
you need not worry.

I would never harm
my Oleta's little girl.

So, I say ride, Sheriff,
before I change my mind.

I'm sorry you won't be here
to celebrate Day of the Dead
here with us.

We will miss you, Martinez.

first husband, Martinez, 
by sending him away,

he invited everyone to town

to a celebration 
of DÃ­a de los Muertos

for the final excavation 
of the temple.

But he betrayed them all,

[horse neighs]

[people screaming]

detonating it and 
imprisoning everyone within,

looting its treasure 
for himself

and sealing a bargain 
with the Goddess of Death. [sobbing]

So everyone in the town 
was buried alive,

but not Vargas.

No, he had other things
to attend to that night.

I'll tell ya,
when I get back to Texas,
I'm gonna sell this junk,

and buy myself
the biggest,

fattest, Texas whore
you ever did see.[all chuckling]

When I get back, I'm gonna
go down to the stable,
get her some--

Papi! Papi! Papi!

Luis, what have you
done to your face?

Can I go
to the celebration, too?

No, Luis. You must
practice your violin.
It is very important.

You must be the best
at everything you do,

and your playing
is improving all the time.

In time, you will thank me
for all the sacrifices

I have made for our family.

But I wanna go. Everyone else
in town will be there.

No, Luis.

Do as I say,
or I'll take you to my knee.

Now, there will be much time
to celebrate later.

As I was saying, none of this
would be damn near possible
without you, Mr. Vargas.

All we been doing
was working the brothels

and bouncing barflies
back north.

You invited us
into your home,

made us part
of your family.

We won't forget what
you've done for us.
No, sir, we won't ever forget.

A toast to Mr. Vargas.

Here, here.

And to Mictecacihuatl,

lady of the dead,

who has brought us all together
and given us so much.

Here, here.

Given me so much.

So very, very much.

[Men gagging, choking]

Well, well, Sheriff.

What brings you back
to our little town?

Couldn't bear to leave without
seeing Oleta one last time.

Or did you forget,
she is my wife now.

You know damn well
what I'm doing here.

You sacrificed them,
all of them,

our whole town, for what?

For wealth.
Haven't you taken enough
from this town?

And from me?

It was a terrible accident,
Sheriff.

Like these men
you accidentally poisoned.

Like I'm accidentally
going to kill you.

Papi! Papi! [fires gun]



[screaming, crying] 
Cabron!

Help me, Oleta!


Luis, no!

Cabron!

Luis, no!

He had killed his only heir,
his beloved son,

and was left with
a wife racked with grief
and a fool's fortune.

He has spent the rest
of his eternal life

in the penthouse,

waited on dutifully by his wife
and stepdaughter

who served his every need.

The diary pages.

Everyone in our town 
who has died an unnatural death

will return to walk again 
on DÃ­a de los Muertos.

Martia, what do 
the dead want?

Revenge.

What's going on?

What's it say? Dejalos entra.

Babe, I don't speak Spanish."Let them in."

Let them in?That's what the diary says,
"Let them in."

Let them in?
What, are you crazy?Maybe.

Wait.

[cocks gun]Here.

Give me a kiss.

Alicia?Yeah.

I love you.

I love you too.

Shit!

Vargas Diaz?


Callate. What?

She is beautiful,

like your daughter.

In fact,

do I detect
a family resemblance?

All this, all the lives,

all the people and
the suffering for this?

The great Vargas Diaz is nothing
more than a pampered child.

Tell me,

was eternal life
worth it?

I think so.


Worth it to taste
your young flesh.


[hissing, moaning]

[whimpering continues][sighs]

[gasping, moaning]

Enjoy it while
you can, asshole.
Company's coming.

[zombies moaning]

Stay away from me!

I wanna live!

[flesh tearing]


Joss? Joss?

Joss!

Joss!Right here, Alicia.


I guess
they're all gone.

Yeah.

Martia, you must
come with us.I cannot.

You can't stay here.

Do you know why Oleta set
two plates on the night
of the dead?

She waits for her
two children to return.

Her only son
she conceived with Vargas,

and whom he killed
that fateful night.

She also had a daughter,

one whom Vargas
promised never to harm

if the sheriff didn't
interfere with his plans.

A promise he broke.

Her name was Martia Martinez.

Remember her, Alicia.
She will always remember you.

You okay?

Not so much, no.

No?

Um--

Thought it was just me.
