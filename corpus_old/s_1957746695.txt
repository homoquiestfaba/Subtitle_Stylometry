This is our street,

and something really weird
is in the air.

You don't know what,
but something.

[crickets chirping]

It's beautiful.

It almost looks like...mist

or ash, something.

[wind whooshing]

It almost seems like snow.

So cool.

Hey--hey, Mom.
Hey--hey, Dad.

We decided to make
a video diary for you

<i>while you're away,</i>
<i>so just get well soon, please,</i>

<i>'cause we don't like</i>
<i>being alone.</i>

[pan sizzling]

Why do the eggs look bubbly?

Because eggs bubble
when you cook them.

They do?
Dude.

Gordon Ramsay
would not be proud of you.

<i>- [laughs]</i>

Whoa, so messy.
Iris' room

must be way more messy.
Lucas won't clean his room.

He won't do it.
Hold on.

Focus better.
Here's his baby doll.

It's not a baby doll.

Raggedy Andy,
the little baby.

[laughs]
Stop!

[both speaking indistinctly]

Curse!

Curse for life!

Demons will be down upon you,
and you will die!

Die!

<i>Hi, Fran and Vincente.</i>

Hi, guys.
How are you?

We're good. We're good.
What are you guys up to?

Making a video diary
for Mom and Dad.

You guys wanna say hi?

Hey, Gretchen. How you doing?
Hey, Gretchen.

[coughs]
Are you guys all right?

Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.

You kids come by anytime.
Drop by, guys.

Love you guys.
Bye.

Yeah, stay safe out there.

<i>- We will.</i>

Okay, so for some reason,

Lucas insisted
on going barefoot.

Yeah, 'cause shoes suck.

But anyways, we're sneaking
into Brenda and Jay's.

We're going to use their pool,

their crystal clean pool,

which Lucas promises
not to pee in.

Hey! I would never
pee in their pool.

You would, and you have.

Well, I mean, maybe a little.

All right, ready?

I'm ready.
Okay, 1, 2, 3, go!

<i>- â™ª You could possibly wear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mess it up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Time is up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hey, guys.

My face is really crooked.

Um...[laughs]

It's been, like,
a day and a half

since you guys have responded,

but it says
you're opening our messages.

So if you could
just send a response

to me and Lucas,
that'd be really nice.

Love you. Bye.

So why'd you
do that last night?

Why'd I do what?

Can you sit down?
Yeah.

Why are you recording me?

I'm trying to get
your confession tape, Lucas.

What confession tape?

Why'd you leave
all the stuff

in the middle of the hallway?

What stuff?

<i>["Clair de Lune" playing</i>

So despite
your son being a dick,

trying to freak me out,
I'm still being a good sister

Hi, I'm Dad,
and I'm a famous TV director.

I'm superstitious
about this hat,

and the hat is, like,
so important

because everything
will go wrong

if I don't use it on set.

The blue one's
the lucky hat, dumbass.

Better go get
the blue one, then!

Take off Dad's lucky hat.

No.

Take it off.
No.

Dude, that's his special hat.

Take it off.
No.

Hey, you want my movie
to fall apart?

I don't,
but I also don't want you

to lose it
and mess it up for Dad.

Wow, okay.

Where do you think
you're going with that?

Bringing the hat
back to its rightful home.

Now the movie's
gonna be cursed,

thanks to you.

Bye-bye.

â™ª â™ª

And that's all I know.

[piano lid slams]

[birds chirping]

[phone chimes]

Iris, why are you recording?

<i>- The mysterious disease</i>
<i>that has already...</i>

I already told you
why I'm recording.

<i>- Killed over 2,000 people</i>
<i>in Los Angeles County alone...</i>

No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

I have to record it.
It's history.

I know it's history,
but why record it?

Dude, what is your problem?

I don't have a problem.

I'm just asking you
a simple question.

Okay, can you shut up now?

I would, but you're being
super annoying,

making me listen
to the news all day.

<i>- I'm being annoying?</i>

<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

<i>- Are nothing but a theater</i>
<i>being performed</i>

<i>by the devil</i>
<i>seeking to get his due.</i>

What did I do?
Come on.

Why'd you record me sleeping
in the middle of the night?

No, I didn't.

Dude. The severed fingers?

The knife?

How'd you do that?

Admit it,
or I'm gonna tell Mom.

I didn't.

What do I have to admit?

The video's
on my camera roll, Lucas.

Go back to sleep.

I'm so done.

Stop playing the news.
It's getting very annoying.

Or you could stop
being mean and complaining.

Why do you
keep playing the news?

'Cause I feel
like playing the news.

Seriously. Stop.

Go in the other room
and annoy the cat

if you don't want
to hear the news, Lucas.

<i>- The stench and taste</i>
<i>of death</i>

<i>in their mouth.</i>
Leave me alone.

<i>[rock music]</i>

[phone chimes]
Hi.

Iris is showing me or...

interrupting everything I do
with the news.

And all the time,
it's just nothing

but people dying
and people sick and--

[metallic clang]

What?

Iris?


[metallic clanging]
What?

Iris! Where are you?
[dull thudding]

What?

Why'd you turn
your lights off?

The lights--

Well, why don't you just
click the--

I don't know what's going on.
The lights turned off.

You turned off your lights.

What? No, I didn't.

How else--
that's not possible.

Go check the video.
Go check the video.

Fine, I will check the video.
Yeah, it has all the proof.

I know what you're doing.

I'm not doing anything.
I know what you're doing.

Okay, all around the house,

something's going on
with the lights.

Not going off, like
in the video Lucas forwarded.

But there's a weird
flickering happening,

like a candle or something.

I tried to tell Lucas it was
probably just electrical.

But he doesn't
believe a word I say.

And now, after being
a royal dick to me

for the last three days,

he's acting like
a helpless little lamb

and begging me to be with him
at all times.

As if the lights flickering,
they're gonna kill him.

So we go over to our neighbors
to ask if they can come over

and give him
some adult-style comfort.

But they're not home.

And now here we are, and it's
happening in your office too,

which, by itself,
I wouldn't find very creepy,

but, Dad, I have to ask.

What the hell
is the closet creeper?

<i>[mellow rock music]</i>

I'm hoping he's a character
idea for one of your movies

and you didn't really
write this.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

All right, time to say
good night to Mom and Dad.

Good night, Mom and Dad.

Anything else you want to say
before I leave?

You could say, "I love you."
I love you.

Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

Good night.
Wait, wait, wait.

Can you stay with me, please,
please?

Lucas, I already told you
I'm not sleeping

in the bed with you.

You just have to be a big boy.

How am I supposed
to be a big boy?

That makes me
sound younger than I am.

Seriously, it's not how old
I am or how not-old I am.

I'm actually scared.
You're scared sometimes, right?

Should I close your curtains
or something?

No. That's not gonna
change anything, please.

Dude, I'm going to bed.

I'm begging you.

Why is it so hard
just to stay with me?

Because I don't want to.

Iris, if you leave,
that's really mean

and jerky of you.

Mean and jerky of me?

Yeah.

Okay, sweet dreams.

All right,
see you later, jerk.

You don't even know
what mean and jerky is, Lucas.

Jerk, jerk--you're a jerk!

Punk-ass.

<i>[white noise hissing]</i>

This is my noisemaker.

I can't sleep without it.

And there's Brodie.

<i>â™ª How'd I find myself</i>

<i>â™ª I'm so stressed,</i>
<i>I'm upset â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know best,</i>

<i>â™ª Don't wanna see me fall,</i>

Iris?

<i>- â™ª How'd I find myself</i>

Oh, hi, Lucas.

<i>- â™ª I'm so stressed,</i>
<i>I'm upset â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know best,</i>
<i>unbelievable â™ª</i>

Hi, Lucas.

Can I come in?

I thought I was a mean jerk.

Well...

now you are, if you're not
letting me come in.

[high-pitched]
Bye, Lucas.

Okay, you are
being a jerk now.

Bye.
Adios.

<i>[sparse piano music playing]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[keyboard keys clacking]

<i>- Iris keeps on locking me</i>
<i>out of her room because she--</i>

<i>there's a bunch</i>
<i>of creepy things</i>

happening right now, and she--

and I think it's ghosts,
but she doesn't believe me,

and she thinks it's me
and I'm playing a prank on her,

which I'm not, and...yeah.

[objects clatter]

[footsteps thumping]

[dog barking]

<i>- One, two, ready, go.</i>

<i>[Karen O's "Day Go By"]</i>

So I went into your drawer

to find a needle and thread,

and I found this.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Are we really in danger
of losing our house?

<i>- â™ª Day go by â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Daybreak, can't wait for â™ª</i>

Iris.

Iris!

Iris.

What?

Where's Raggedy Andy?
Have you seen him anywhere?

What?

Are you serious?

Where is Rag-ged-dy A-an-d-dy?

Lucas, I can't hear
anything you're saying.

[shouting]
Where is Raggedy Andy?

Dude, come over here
if you want to talk to me.

I can't hear you.

Deaf!

<i>- â™ª Doctor, doctor â™ª</i>

Olly, olly oxen
free, free, free.

Raggedy Andy, where can you be?

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

<i>- â™ª My pain is gone â™ª</i>

Did you look in your room?

Yeah, I looked in my room.

That's the most basic
spot ever.

And he obviously
should be in my room,

but he's not in my room.

What about the kitchen?

Okay, are you
actually gonna help,

or are you just gonna
keep on using makeup,

recording yourself
like a creep?

What do you mean,
like a creep?

I'm being a normal person.

Do normal people
put on makeup

and record themselves
just to send it to no one?

<i>- â™ª Time away â™ª</i>

You know what, dude?
Get out of my face.

You hid him from me,
didn't you?

That's the stupidest
accusation I've ever heard.

You just want revenge on me,
don't you?

For what?

For the pranks
you think I'm pulling,

which I'm not.

Lucas, right now,
I think you're

either insane
or have a brain disease.

Maybe you lost him

making that crazy movie
you're working on.

You have no idea
how done I am

with this stupid conversation.

Oh, my God,
what's wrong with you?

Bye!

<i>- â™ª Doctor, doctor â™ª</i>

[phone chimes]
She hid Raggedy Andy.

[timer rings]

She's keeping him away from me.
I know it.

<i>- Last night, I had a dream</i>

<i>so I left the house.</i>

<i>[airy music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>But our front yard</i>
<i>was not our front yard.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Then for some reason, I was</i>
<i>transported back in time.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>But Lucas</i>
<i>was still in the future.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>So I flew back</i>
<i>and asked him to come with me.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Then I realized we weren't</i>
<i>time traveling at all.</i>

<i>We were watching</i>
<i>a film you'd made</i>

<i>out of our memories</i>

<i>without asking us permission.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>You weren't there</i>
<i>in any of the images,</i>

<i>but almost like</i>
<i>I could see you</i>

<i>through my closed eyelids,</i>

<i>watching me,</i>

<i>filming me</i>

<i>while I was sleeping.</i>

<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>Only it wasn't exactly you.</i>

<i>You were something else,</i>
<i>something dark.</i>

<i>You were in a costume,</i>

<i>a costume I'd seen before,</i>
<i>but I couldn't quite place it.</i>

<i>Finally,</i>
<i>it came to me what it was.</i>

<i>And there you were,</i>

<i>just like in my dream,</i>
<i>on the poster</i>

<i>for that demon movie</i>
<i>you made last year.</i>

<i>Anyway, it's creepy here</i>
<i>without you.</i>

<i>And Lucas is acting weird,</i>
<i>so please get better soon.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

I've been learning this song
while you're away,

and it's called--
oh, I don't know.

But you'll really like
this song,

and it's a classical piece,
I'm pretty sure.

Doesn't sound like one,
but I'm pretty sure it is.

Okay, I'm gonna play it.

<i>- â™ª I put my head</i>
<i>on the pillow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª First thing I see</i>
<i>is your face â™ª</i>

So I was in
a pretty good mood.

And then I walked
into the living room,

and I found Lucas' poetry
that he left me.

"Keep recording his scenes
or suffer the consequences.

Iris, this means you."

I told you I didn't do it.

What are you saying,
a goblin did it?

Maybe so.
[sighs] Jackass.

[phone chimes]

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>[audience laughter over TV]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>[indistinct dialogue over TV]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Were you
gonna offer me any?

Why not?

Because.

That's not nice.

Sharing is caring, Lucas.

Yeah, I don't care,

so I won't share.

You're such a dick.

It all adds up.

It adds up
to you being a dick.

All you've been doing is
just blaming me for everything.

So should I share
my strawberries?

If you don't share
those strawberries,

I think I might murder you.

These are my strawberries.
They're not yours.

Lucas, when someone asks you
for a strawberry...

No! No!
You give them a strawberry.

Get away from me!
Give it.

Stop!
Give me those strawberries!

They're my strawberries!

Those are not
your strawberries!

No!
They're our strawberries!

But if you want them back,
I'll happily smush them

up your stupid nose.

Yeah?
Want it?

Give me back
my fucking strawberries!

No!

Stop!

<i>[ominous music]</i>

I know I'm not really
supposed to be in Dad's office,

but I came in here
looking for Iris,

and I found this creepy video
she was cutting together.

I don't know why anyone
would make a movie like this.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I mean, what is that thing?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

But maybe most freaky of all,

what kind of psycho
paints strawberries black

and then red again?

I hope she didn't
want to poison me.

<i>[whimsical music playing</i>
<i>over TV]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

It's actually turning out
kind of good.

I'm like Bob Ross.

But I don't think Bob Ross
paints anything

other than tr--I've seen, like,
every episode of that show,

and I don't think
he paints anything

other than lakes and trees.

<i>- [vocalizing]</i>

But--and good for him,
but it's--I don't know.

What if he did, like, a city?

Do you think
he could paint a city?

<i>- [vocalizing]</i>

Probably not, actually.

I don't think he could do it.

<i>- [vocalizing]</i>

Lucas does not like Bob Ross,

but he just needs
to get into it,

and then maybe
he'll understand.

Hey, Iris,
I just came to say that...

I'm sorry for being
such a jerk earlier.

All right.

Hey, Lucas,
thanks for apologizing,

but please don't film my art.

It's not finished yet.
Okay, I'm sorry. I won't.

Dude, just so you know,
I came down here

to have some alone time.

I know, but, Iris?

Yes?
Some really weird videos

showed up on my camera roll.

What?

They were just
on the camera rolls

that one of us shot.

You're not making sense.

What are you talking about?

There's just videos.

I don't think
either of us took them.

What are you talking about?
Just look on

my video camera roll.
Give it to me.

I don't know who or what.

<i>I think someone's filming us.</i>

<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>["Claire de Lune" playing</i>

Lucas just showed me
this video.

I do not know...

Now, I didn't shoot it.

Watch.

What? What is it?

Iris, you're scaring me.

I thought I saw something
by the piano.

Something like what?

It was like a flash of light.

Like a lightning bug
or something?

[phone chimes]
Hang on a second.

Who is that?
Who texted you?

I don't know. There's no ID.

Iris, that--that's not
what I think it is, is it?

Why would you say that?

Because leaving the house

doesn't seem to change
anything at all.

How would you know that?

There's other videos

I haven't shown you yet.

What videos?

Hi, Iris.

Hey, Lucas.

Do you think
you did all of this?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I'm worried
I'm gonna hurt you, Lucas.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

When I was walking up,
I saw a thing on your back.

Is it, like, a cut?

What?
Looks like something

spreading down on your neck

to your shirt.

What do you mean?

I don't know.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

What the fuck?
What the fuck?



<i>â™ª â™ª</i>




Lucas, what do we do?

I know we're not supposed to,
but...

<i>I think we should see</i>
<i>Mom and Dad.</i>

[birds chirping]

[helicopter rotors whirring]

[sirens wailing]

<i>[indistinct radio chatter]</i>

[horn blaring]

<i>[indistinct radio chatter]</i>

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

What you're about to see
is what Lucas and I saw

when we came back
from the hospital

to try to--

to try to see you.

Lucas freaked out and decided
to go ask the neighbors

for help.

<i>- Cath!</i>

<i>Eli!</i>
<i>[knocking]</i>

<i>Anybody home?</i>
<i>[doorbell rings]</i>

But nobody came to the door.

<i>[ominous music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

We called all your friends,
and no one answered.

Grandma Marsha
isn't answering either.

But the worst part is,

Lucas didn't even shoot
these videos.

These were just texted to us
from some unknown sender.

It's like
whoever's recording us

can see right through
our eyes.

<i>- Anthony?</i>
<i>[knocking]</i>

<i>Anthony, Georgia!</i>

<i>Hello?</i>
<i>[doorbell ringing]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

The streets
are pretty much empty,

other than stuff like this.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[knock at door]
Iris?

Yo.
[keyboard key clicks]

Is it okay if I sleep
in your room tonight?

[phone chimes]
Sure.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[phone chimes]
Why are you putting it up

on a tripod like that?

'Cause I want to see
if there's anything to see.

Oh.

Won't the phone die
if we leave it on all night?

No, it's on a motion sensor.

So, like, if anything moves,
it just--

it'll just record for, like,
ten seconds.

And then it shuts off.
What if it's too dark?

There's a flash.

Like, right now.

[birds chirping]

<i>[ominous music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Iris?
What?

Maybe instead
of thinking of these things

as just words on a list,

we could think of them
as ideas.

Like, the photo
might not be a picture,

but it could be us
or you and me together.

Writing it down.

"You and me together."

But it doesn't make any sense.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Okay.

Watch.

Where's the apple?

Lucas, where's the apple?

I don't know.
Apple's gone.

I can go get another.

[piano note plays]

<i>[ominous music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Okay.

Watch, apple, nail, timer,

U-shaped magnet,
and a brown egg.


Makes no sense at all.

Well, wait, okay.

If we do this, you're right.

It makes no sense.

But if we do this...

W-A-N-T...

both: M-O-R-E.

Wouldn't that
just be a coincidence?

I don't think
that's a coincidence.

So what happens if we go back
and try the other one now?

Let's see.

H-H-T-C-R-A-O.

That doesn't spell anything.

Wait, there's more.

Egg.

Still doesn't spell anything.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- Iris, I have a thought.</i>

What's your thought?

You know
how I'm always asking

for oranges all the time?

I guess so.
Why?

Remember Mom got so mad

because we kept on running out

and I kept on begging
for more and more?

Where are you going
with this?

It's basically
the same thing as the ring.

My ring?
Yeah.

Wait, where'd it go?

It's here on my finger.
I put it on. Why?

That's not just any ring
that you own.

That's the one that you
were super jealous

of Ruby for having,

so she had to give it to you.

Yeah.

I remember you almost
stopped being friends

because she wouldn't
lend it to you

and she thought
you were being greedy.

Yeah.

I'm saying maybe
we should write down

"greed" or "jealousy"
as one of our words.

Okay.

But honestly, I feel like
you could see anything

you want in these things.

That could be true,

but remember when Dad
got me that bike light

and I freaked out
'cause I wanted the square one

instead of the round one?

No, what are you
talking about?

Dad said something like,
"Well, it's too bad.

You don't get to choose."

And then we screamed
at each other

for, like,
the whole entire day.

Sounds like
the kind of stupid fight

you two might have.

So what?
Yeah, what I'm saying is

maybe that this is all about us
having to choose.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Maybe.

Choose what?

why would you do that, Lucas?

It was saying something!
I just couldn't stand it.

Move. Get away from it.

It's gonna happen again.
It's gonna start again.

Go away.

<i>[Gretchen Lieberum's "My</i>
<i>Darling, My Darling" playing]</i>

What fucking song is this?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Lucas, why does this
sound familiar?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I think maybe it's because

it's one of the songs
from Mom's new record.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª My darling, my darling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've wanted</i>
<i>to call you â™ª</i>

You're right. It is Mom.

<i>- â™ª For many</i>

<i>â™ª And many a day â™ª</i>

<i>[ominous music]</i>

<i>â™ª My darling, my darling â™ª</i>

[radio clicks off]

[crickets chirping]

[harsh piano notes]

Oh, my God.

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Is that Grandpa Frank
with seeds on him?

Yeah. Why?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Oh, my God,
I haven't seen this in years.

That's the magnet you traded
me for when I was, like, five.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Take your hands off of that.

It's mine.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Let me see that.
Hang on.

Give it.
I said hang on.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Iris, I think I know exactly
what it's trying to say.

What does it say?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Like, I think the lock
means something about

how things are set in stone
and can't be undone.

And the magnet,
it's about a trade.

But I don't think
it's about the trade we made.

And I think the thing
with Grandpa Frank

and the seeds means
it all started with him.

The Super 8 camera's
obviously about Dad's movies.

And I think the hammer
might be about how Dad

convinced Mom to have me.

What are you talking about?

Remember how she
only wanted one kid

and her excuse was something
like the house is too small?

Right, he promised
to build her a new room.

Brought home
a hammer and nails.

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

Iris, have you
ever heard about

things called the Wanderers?

Why does that sound
so familiar?

According to what I searched,
it's a kind of demon,

a kind of demon who wants
to confuse and scare people

into doing what it wants.

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

And the reason
it sounds so familiar...

look at this description
of Dad's movie.

"A father sells his children

"to a demon known
as the Wanderer

in exchange
for fame and fortune."

Iris, I think this movie
was based on something real,

something that maybe even
started before Dad was born.

So you think Grandpa Frank
made a deal with a demon?

Uh-huh.

Then Dad.

And now I think he wants
to make a deal with us.

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

What kind of deal?

Well, like,

my baby handprint
and your childhood bracelet,

that means
something to do with kids.

What does that mean?

I think it wants us
to give it

more than what Dad gave it.

More than two kids?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[crickets chirping]

<i>I didn't tell Lucas this</i>

<i>because I didn't want</i>
<i>to scare him.</i>

<i>But the other night,</i>
<i>I had a dream.</i>

<i>I was lost</i>
<i>in some dark forest,</i>

<i>looking for him.</i>

<i>And I couldn't find him.</i>

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

<i>It was vague,</i>
<i>but somehow I knew</i>

<i>I had allowed something awful</i>
<i>to swallow us both up.</i>

<i>I woke up so ashamed.</i>

<i>But now...</i>

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it was my fault at all.</i>

I don't have any proof.

But I believe everything
Lucas says about you.

[discordant piano notes]

Did you sell us to it?

â™ª â™ª

For fame or money?

â™ª â™ª

Whatever the fuck you want?

â™ª â™ª

You sold your own kids?

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

[birds chirping]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- Hello, my name</i>
<i>is Dr. Susannah Rogers,</i>

<i>and thank you for visiting</i>
<i>our page today,</i>

<i>where we will be discussing</i>
<i>the nature of demons</i>

<i>and strategies</i>
<i>people sometimes use</i>

<i>to attempt</i>
<i>to communicate with them.</i>

Throughout the ages,
humanity has tried

to access the spirit world,

be it through sÃ©ance, trance,

transcendental psychotropic
experiences,

and through extreme behaviors
such as fasting for weeks,

speaking in tongues for days,

<i>or the application</i>
<i>of extreme pain,</i>

<i>such as branding or fire.</i>

<i>Others have used Ouija boards</i>

<i>or the recitation</i>
<i>of ritual prayer</i>

<i>often written in a language</i>

<i>that the speaker themselves</i>
<i>does not know.</i>

<i>The thing that binds</i>
<i>all of these rituals together</i>

<i>is not the specifics</i>
<i>of the effort</i>

<i>but the intent and the belief</i>
<i>of the summoner of the spirit.</i>

<i>Demons,</i>
<i>particularly Wanderers,</i>

<i>know when a person is</i>
<i>desperate and in need of help,</i>

<i>not because of the words</i>
<i>that they speak</i>

<i>or the actions that they take</i>

<i>but because of the feeling</i>

<i>of the person</i>
<i>speaking those words</i>

<i>and taking those actions.</i>

<i>They can feel the sincere need</i>
<i>exhibited in your prayer.</i>

<i>Little else matters,</i>

<i>certainly not the order</i>

<i>or the recitation</i>
<i>of ancient ceremonial rites.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>The demon prefers novel,</i>

<i>personalized approaches</i>
<i>to summoning,</i>

<i>because those who create</i>
<i>their own ritual</i>

<i>with pure and true belief</i>

<i>are often those</i>
<i>who are most corruptible.</i>

<i>End of message.</i>
<i>Have a safe journey.</i>

<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[scissors snipping]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

With this,
my deepest, darkest secret,

I wish for you to speak.

With this,
my deepest, darkest secret,

I wish for you to speak.

For this,
my sacred childhood object,

I wish for you to speak.

With this, given to me
by my beloved grandmother,

I wish for you to speak.

For giving you these herbs
from a plant I planted,

I wish for you to speak.

With a memory from my past,
I wish for you to speak.

With this beautiful bottle
I found,

I wish for you to speak.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

And this watch, given to me
by my Grandpa Frank,

I wish for you to speak.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

With this fire...

both:
We beg of you to speak.

[fire crackling]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I don't think
it's gonna work.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[melodica note plays]

<i>[low buzzing]</i>

[fire crackling]

[fire roaring]

<i>[ominous music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hey, Lucas.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Lucas, it worked.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

What is this?

Is this
Grandpa Frank's melodica?

Remember
when he gave it to us?

He was like,
"If you want to,

you could be
a famous musician."

Maybe it's here
to remind us of that.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

What about my crystals?

Those were
your most precious things

when you were little.

I think it's saying
it can get us

more stuff like that
if we do if it wants.

And this picture of Dad
with the dead flowers,

when I first looked at it,
I was sure it meant

that Dad was about to die.

You think Dad's dead?

Maybe.

Or maybe the demon
just wants us to believe that.

This stuff over here
seems to mean

it wants us to choose
which way to go.

And with those things
it somehow unburned,

I'm guessing it wants us
to see how powerful it is.

What about
your old bike lock?

I'm pretty sure it's saying
we're going to be taken.

Taken by the demon?

Yeah.

And I think this watch here

means we only have
until 3:17 a.m. to decide.

Decide whether
to take its offer?

Yeah.

Why 3:17 a.m.?

<i>- I have no idea.</i>

<i>- What about the journal?</i>

What's Dad's story journal
doing here?

Well...

either it's telling us
if we go with it,

we get to write our own story,

or could just be--
could just be

<i>wanting us to sign our names.</i>

And the bell?
[bell rings]

What do you think the bell is?

The bell means nothing to me,

and neither do Grandpa's
old opera glasses.

But the fire being on,
it's probably a warning.

<i>[ominous tone]</i>

You didn't start the fire?

No.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- You're saying</i>
<i>the fire's saying</i>

<i>that's how it's gonna feel</i>

<i>if we don't give it</i>
<i>what it wants?</i>

Yeah.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>- Do you think Mom and Dad</i>
<i>get to live</i>

if we agree to do
what it's asking?

I don't know.
