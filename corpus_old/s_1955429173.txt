On this special two-hour episode.

Of "Finding bigfoot"...

The team returns
To north carolina,

Where one appalachian family
Has been reporting sightings.

On their property
For generations.

And all of you have experienced
Sasquatch activity.

At one time or another?

Inundated with reports
At the town-hall meeting...

No!

Big, glowing eyes.

It stood there,
And then swayed back and forth.

That's only one thing
In this world it could be,

And that's a bigfoot.

You guys are not Disappointing.

The team calls for backup.

Hey!

Ranae's cousin laura,

Matt's son leo,

Cliff's brother rob,

And bobo's good friend bud.

With friends and family
By their side,

They hit the trail,

Investigating
Its most isolated sectors,

All leading
To a final, epic night.

In the wilds of appalachia.

Yeah!

It's here. Down that way.

Shush.

Listen!

I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

It was impossibly large.

It definitely wasn't human.

I've been tracking
Sasquatches for 25 years.

These animals,
In fact, are real.

I've seen them. They're here.

I'm having
A really difficult time.

Finding an explanation for this.

There's something on the hill!

I do think there's a 'squatch
In these woods.

Discovery communications.

The team and I are back
In north carolina.

Five years ago,
We did an expedition.

In central north carolina,
Where we got some action.

This time, we're in
The western part of the state.

And we're hoping
To get some action here, too.

Out here in the west, you have
The appalachian mountain range,

Which the appalachian trail
Runs through.

Sasquatches love
That mountainous terrain.

And with all the caves
Around here,

They've got
A lot of places to hide.

Whenever we're
In the appalachian mountains,

We invariably run into reports
Along the appalachian trail.

The reports
From the appalachians.

Date back centuries.

For as long as people have lived
In these mountains,

They've been reporting
Sasquatch sightings.

In fact, we got a call
From a family.

That lives less than a mile
From the appalachian trail.

And they say
They've been having activity.

And encounters in that family
For generations.

So that's where we're headed.

Well, we are back
In north carolina.

And we know
From previous investigations.

In the south
And on the east coast,

Probably the number-one
Common denominator.

Has been the a.T...
The appalachian trail.

Yeah, so much stuff happens
Along the appalachian trail,

But part of that's because
It's such a long trail.

In starts in georgia
And ends in maine.

A lot of people take months off.

To walk the entire stretch
Of the trail.

And some of those people.

Encounter sasquatches
Along the way.

Our area of focus
Here in north carolina.

Is a little bit different
Than some of the other areas.

We've looked into in the south.

<I>I mean, these mountains
Are serious mountains.</I>

They are high. They are steep.

They are rugged.

This is great habitat
For sasquatches.

And I realized this morning
That it's five years to the day.

That we had
Our first expedition together.

We went with mike green
For the squeaky thermal footage.

That's right.

That wasn't very far
From here, either.

That bigfoot reached out
And just grabbed that candy bar.

And that squeaky footage
Was the first thermal footage,

I'm aware of,
That we agreed was a sasquatch.

I can't believe it took us
So long to come back here.

Our first expedition
As a team together was here.

We had definite 'squatch action
Last time we were here,

And we may even
Have seen a 'squatch.

So, now we're back.
Hopes are high.

I can't believe
It's taken us this long.

To get back here, Honestly.

I mean, there is so much
Viable habitat.

For sasquatches
Here in north carolina.

We could've done.

Five or six different
Expeditions here by now.

It is an outdoor mecca.

There's 600 miles of trails
In one of the nearby forests,

White-water rafting,
A lot of climbing.

There are tons of tourists
And locals outdoors every day.

Engaging in various forms
Of recreational activity.

Along the appalachian trail.

Will all these people
Spending time out in the woods,

Of course some of them
Are bound to "See" bigfoots.

<I>The question is,
What is they're really seeing?</I>

We have to go look
Into this guy, ernie bradford,

And his family.

They've got
This big piece of land.

Backed up right
To the national forest.

And three generations Of them.

Say that Bigfoots come around.

And if we come there,
We might have an encounter.

If three generations
Of this family.

Have been having
Ongoing activity.

Pretty much all that time,

There's something special
About this particular property.

That's not a coincidence.

This place is pretty out there.

We drove way up
Into the mountains,

Went to the top of this holler.

That's property of this family,
The bradfords.

The appalachian trail sits only
About a mile up the hill.

So they're right next to it.

And there's no buildings
Between here and there.

So, I mean,
It's prime 'squatch territory.

Beautiful property
You guys have back here.

Thanks.
Thank you.

So, we have three
Generations of the same family.

In front of us here?

And all of you have experienced
Sasquatch activity.

At one time or another?

Really?

And how long's your family been
On this piece of property?

Back to 1700s.

Wow.
Man.

Late 17s.

And how far back
Did the bigfoot activity go?

We'd hear tales of it
From our great-grandfather.

He would tell us to be careful
And not get too far out,

Or don't get in the woods
Playing.

We knew the rules.
We had our boundaries.

"Do not get out of sight
Or earshot."

how about you, lakota?
Have you ever seen one?

Yeah.

Where did you see one?

Up there.

What happened?

I was playing soccer
With my friends.

When the ball rolled
Down the road,

That's when I noticed
It was looking at us.

It was up on the hill.
It was standing there watching.

Okay.
And so it came down.

Did it sit down, or did it...
Was it standing up?

Standing up.

And what color was it?

Blackish brown.

I came outside,
And she was like,

"There's something up there
Watching us."

I saw it standing up
On the hill.

That day, I saw a bigfoot.

So, you and the friends.

Were sitting there playing
And talking about it,

And you all knew It was there?

Did you all know
It was a bigfoot?

No.

Do you think they've ever
Come around the houses?

Yes.

There was one That was looking.

In my oldest daughter's
Bedroom window.

After we had had
A birthday party.

We heard knocking...

Not really like
He was knocking...

Like he was kind of
Pushing his way around.

But my mom saw the figure
In the window.

Now, ernie, you've lived
On this property.

For almost six decades.

What's the earliest encounter
You can remember having.

With one Of these things?

40 years ago, 38 years ago?

There's no doubt there's
'squatches on this property.

They've all seen them.
They're not all lying.

I don't think
They're a family of liars.

They're just telling you
What they've seen,

And they have them here.

I have no doubt you guys
Have bigfoots on this property.

And you've seen them.

Definitely.

Are there bigfoots
On this property?

I would think it would be safe
To say no.

Still, it's hard to argue with
Three generations of stories.

There's only one way
For us to find out.

We need to stay here
And do a night investigation.

If you guys would let us,

Could we do a night
Investigation around here?

Where would you go?

I think We're down for that.

Well, hopefully, that
Four decades of bigfoot activity.

Can extend at least
One more night for us.

Glad to have you.
Good luck.

All right.

We're not far from
The appalachian trail.

And the 'squatches up here,

They must have adapted
To being up in the mountains.

Ernie's family said.

They've been having stuff
Happen up here.

For multiple generations,

So they're gonna be
Up around here somewhere.

Well, ernie seemed
To be pretty positive.

Even though it's wintertime,
He thinks we've got to go up.

To find those 'squatches.

Well, I like a challenge.

Matt, why don't we walk
Up on top of these ridges.

And make some calls
Back and forth?

And hopefully something
Is in this valley tonight.

All right.
We'll just go with you guys.

Up to the split the trail
And then fork off.

All right. Let's do that.

Yeah, Let's go fork off.

My god.
It goes straight up right here.

That is the trail, Isn't it?

I mean, This isn't even a trail.

I'll let you lead the way,
Bobes.

All right.

So, ernie gave us some intel.

That he thinks
The sasquatches go up high.

So that clearly means
That the teams.

Need to get as high
In altitude as possible.

So, bobo and ranae are gonna
Hit up one trail,

Matt and I are gonna go
To the other trail.

The goal here is to get
On top of the ridges.

And cast as wide a net
As possible,

And by yelling
Into adjacent valleys.

I thought we were gonna be
On a trail-trail.

Just slow and steady, man.

This is sucking.

This is the most level spot
We've found.

Yeah.

This is ridiculous.

Let me call The other team.

Ranae for matt.

What you got going on?

We thought we had
The easy trail.

And this basically goes.

Kind of straight up Back here.

It's also icy.
Any rocks are slick as snot.

Funny... I was just
Saying that to cliff.

This might be one
Of the highest points.

We're gonna reach.

He wants To do a call here.

All right, we'll listen.

We hear it.

Totally hear it.

That's good.

That means stuff's bouncing
Off the frozen walls.

That means We should howl back.

Remember, we want to attract
Attention to this area.

All right. You want to do it?

Yeah, sure. Sure.

All right, ranae, bobo,
Cliff's gonna do a howl.

Keep your ears on.

We're listening.

We're done.

Yeah, we heard it.

They heard it. Good.

That's great.

We wrapped around halfway
Around this mountain.

They can still hear that.

God, You can just slide.

All the way to
The frickin' creek like this.

Well, we do need To go down.

To get to that next section
Of trail.

All right, ready? Go for it.

I'm not tearing My rain paints.

Later.

Careful with those trees.

Yeah.

You all right?

Yep.

Hope you didn't plan
On having kids.

It's kind of cool that
Multi-generations of that family.

All have had
Sasquatch encounters.

Yeah, that would mean
The bigfoot's been.

Coming back through there
Year after year.

For a long time, You know.

Yeah, I like that sasquatches
Are a family affair, you know?

I mean, because,
Like, if your family...

Your brother who you trust
With your life...

Says they saw
One of these things,

What would you do With that?

You would probably just
Believe them, you know?

Right.

Yeah, let's start
Doing some calls.

Shh!

Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Listen, listen!

What?

Howl.

Where? Point.

That way.

Ed to north carolina.

By a family who lives
By the appalachian trail.

Bigfoot sightings have been
Occurring on their property.

For generations,

So we decided we're gonna stay
Right here for the night.

We climbed up high
Into the mountain.

To make some calls.

And I just heard
A possible bigfoot howl.

Shh!

Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Listen, listen!

What?

Howl.

Where? Point.

That way.

How far? Far-far?

It's hard to tell
With the echoes,

But, like, half mile?

Ranae, bobo,
Did you guys just howl?

You heard a howl?
Yeah.

No, we didn't do a howl.

They're hearing a howl.
What kind of howl?

It was... we were walking,
Coming down off the hill,

Crunching through the leaves,
And I hear, "Waaaaah!"

It's in your direction,
But above you.

I'm gonna try To answer back.

Yeah, yeah.

Come on, baby, Do it again.

Come on.

Do us a favor.

Well, you know,

I think sasquatches
Really tune in to noises.

And, you know,
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

If something
Maybe 600 yards away.

Could actually hear us
Going through this forest stuff.

It's 6 inches deep
In spots, man.

They have, like,
Superhuman hearing.

Because They're superhuman-ish.

Okay.

I think we should do an inchworm
On the way back.

Yeah.

You walk 100 feet, Stop, listen.

So, one of us is standing still
While the other is walking.

If it was a 'squatch,
It could get over to us.

And what would happen is,
As we inchworm down,

The person who's in behind.

Will probably hear it
Moving through the brush.

If you're standing still.

All right, cool.
Well, I'll head out this way.

I'll stop
About 150 feet up there.

I'll wait for you. All right?

All right.

Flash your headlight at me
When you want to stop.

Okay.

Okay.

There's A distinct possibility.

That whatever made
That whoop or scream

<I>heard us moving
Through the leaf litter.</I>

Maybe it was alerting
Another sasquatch nearby.

We don't know.

So, to cover ourselves,

We're gonna use
The inchworm technique,

Where one person stands
Perfectly still and listens.

While the other person
Moves ahead.

And makes some noise.

Once that person gets a good
Distance ahead, we signal,

And then the next person
Comes up.

While that person stays still.

We're basically, like,
Leap-frogging each other.

It's slow and tedious,
And it's freezing cold.

But if that was a sasquatch,
Then this is the best way.

To make sure we can hear it
Following us.

So we're gonna inchworm
All the way back to base camp.

Got one howl.

Might've been a 'squatch.

Nice, big howl
From up on that ridge.

Except for the sound of us.

Walking through
The forest leaf litter,

We heard nothing at all
Except for what matt heard.

Yeah.
Yeah.

It was eerily quiet,
Very strange.

Yeah. Ernie knows this place
Like the back of his hand.

He's lived here His whole life.

But I do believe He was mistaken.

In thinking the 'squatches
Were up in that snow and ice.

I think They're down there.

Well, we had to check it out,
And we did.

So, now we'll go to town hall,
See what else we can find out.

Last night,
Matt might have heard something,

But we need a more solid lead
Than that.

So we need to speak
To the people in the community.

And find out where they've been
Seeing bigfoots recently.

And also where
They've seen sasquatches.

At this time of year.

Tonight's town hall is gonna be
At the young men's institute.

In asheville, north carolina.

And I cannot wait to see
How many witnesses we get.

Hello, asheville.

If you believe
That you've seen a bigfoot.

Or heard a bigfoot,

Would you raise your hand,
Please?

Wow.
Not bad.

Pretty good. Okay.

2:30, 3:00 in the morning,
And we're all in our tent.

We have a huge,
Nine-man tent out there.

And all of us are bedded down,
Buttoned down.

And we just start hearing
These awful, loud noises.

And about 20 feet
Just outside of the campsite,

You could see A huge figure.

And it was Absolutely huge.

It was probably
7 1/2, 8 1/2, 9 feet tall.

And we run, and it's about
A mile back to my house,

And I don't think
A single one of us stopped.

Until we got there.

And my dad was awake.

It was about 6:00
In the morning.

Comes into my room, Wakes me up.

And he says, "You have got
To come out here and hear this."

He takes me Out to the porch.

We are listening To this howling.

That's coming
From the mountain ridge.

We was traveling On the road.

And just entered
Into north carolina.

On the madison county side.

We was driving Down the road.

We was going
About 45 miles an hour.

A creature thing
Was running beside us.

It ran over
And jumped over the guardrail.

In over about
The last five to six years,

We've had A lot of encounters.

Tree knocks, whoops.

We sort of just tried to leave
Them alone as much as possible.

Because, you know,
I was one of those.

That if I ever seen it,
I'd kill it.

So everybody would know.

But after hearing them talking
Back and forth to each other,

I just leave them alone
And let them...

Isn't that amazing?
And that's what people think.

They say, "If I see one,
I'm gonna kill one."

And then, when they have
An encounter, they're like,

"These things
Are just way too much."

Like these intelligent things.

"It's just... it'd be
Like shooting a caveman."

It's just, like,
You wouldn't do it.

Yeah.

You guys Are not disappointing.

That was our best town hall
In a long time.

That town hall was fantastic.
We have over 40 witnesses.

It was hairy...
Reddish-brown hair,

Big, glowing eyes.

It stood there,
And it swayed back and forth.

We found A partial footprint.

Where the creature
Stepped up on the bank.

By the time I got in the trailer.

And shut the door,
It hit the trailer.

That's only one thing
In this world it could be,

And that's a bigfoot.

That's good in one way,

But bad in that
That's way too many.

For us to even
Scratch the surface of.

Without some help.

So we're gonna have to call in
Some reinforcements.

So we can really split up
And check these out.

Look at all this.
It's spread all over the place.

And so much of this is just
Great mountain habitat.

Just, where do we start?

I knew asheville
Would be a good spot,

But it was better
Than I could have hoped for.

We're overloaded.

There's too many stories,
Too many reports.

And you look at the map
Where they plot it,

It's the whole western half
Of the state.

We're gonna need
To call in some backup.

I mean, we can't handle this
On our own.

Hey!

There they are.

Mily.

That's been experiencing
Sasquatches for centuries.

After being inundated
With a multitude of stories.

At town hall,

We knew
We're gonna need some help,

So we decided to call in
Some reinforcements.

To help us cover
All of this ground.

There they are.

We were brought out here
By ernie and his family.

To investigate the sasquatch
Reports they've been having,

So it just makes sense.

That we bring in family members
Of our own to help out.

Hey!
Hey!

You found us!

Hey!
Hey!

I know that kid.

I've called my brother rob.

Ranae called in laura,
Her cousin.

Glad you made it.

Matt's called in his son leo.

And bobo called up bud...

His bro,
His brother from another mother.

Good to see you.

Nice seeing you.

Of all the family and friends
That we've invited out,

Leo is the only one
That is confident.

That sasquatches
Are real animals.

But that's okay,
Because rob, laura, and bud...

Even though they're not
100% believers,

They're all open to the idea.

And they're gonna be
A great help on this expedition.

Good to see you, bud.

Well, the help
Has finally arrived.

And, boy,
Were you all necessary,

Because we had
One of the biggest town halls,

In terms of witnesses,
That we've ever had.

They're spread out
All over the place.

So we really do
Have to spread out.

And go in, like,
Four different directions.

And hit up multiple locations
With each team.

Our first witness
That we spoke to.

Is this guy named ernie.

Three generations Of his family.

Had seen sasquatches
On his property before.

So we figured,
"Well, you know what?

We might as well
Bring our family out."

So we're really stoked
You guys are here.

Yep. I brought in
My good buddy bud.

He's a drummer
In our bigfoot rock band,

The yamarone brothers.

It's the world's greatest
Bigfoot rock 'n' roll band.

And he used to play drums
For sublime.

When we went 'squatching
20 years ago,

Nothing happened,

And he's been wanting to go
Ever since.

So I thought this was
A perfect chance.

Well, you brought in
A yamarone brother.

I brought in
A barackman brother...

The real thing here, man.

This is my brother rob.

He's never been out
Bigfooting with me before,

But I thought this was
The perfect opportunity.

Well, I invited my cousin laura.

Our family reunions
Back in south dakota.

Behind My grandmother's house...

I had her believing that bigfoot
Lived on laframboise island.

And terrified her.

Sounds like you're still
Trying to terrify me.

Some things never change.

And this is my son leo.

Cliff and bobo and ranae,
You've all met him years ago.

You are bigger.
He's a big boy now.

And he's ready
To go 'squatching with us.

Is this your first time
Coming out with your dad, leo?

No. I've been with him out
Quite a bit before,

But this Is the first time

I'm out investigating
Witnesses with him.

Well, the one I want
To check out is kendra,

Because her
And another witness...

And there was even a third one
That brought up spruce pine.

Apparently that's a place where
A lot of stuff has happened.

And just those bunch
Of witnesses in that one area.

Tend to corroborate Each other.

Laura, I picked david davis.

That'll be the witnesses
That we follow up with.

They were out at this location
With his two sons at a campfire.

All three of them said they
Saw it... multiple witnesses.

More importantly,
They were terrified.

Awesome.

Well, rob,
I chose these two guys.

Who are Bigfoot investigators...

David and rex.

They have a lot of stuff
Going on.

In this one Particular area.

But, most importantly,
They have evidence.

They have a cast that they claim
Is the best one ever pulled.

Well, I clearly want to go
Take a look at that.

And I'd love To show it to you.

Because you know Your casts.

I'd like to think so.
You do.

Okay, I'm gonna take you with me.

Down to the far
Southwest corner,

Way over there.

Guy named tim, a hunter.

The reason I picked him is
He had action all year long.

Aggressive 'squatches
Throwing rocks, growling.

Sounds like a good time.

Yeah, it will be.

Okay, We all have our partners,

And we all have our witnesses
That we want to go speak to.

Let's break apart
For a couple days.

And reconvene after that
To compare notes.

Let's do it.
Sounds good.

Great.

So, we've mapped out reports.

Across the entire western part
Of the state,

And we've developed
A plan of action.

We're gonna send out four groups
To four different areas.

Bobo and ranae are gonna head
To the south,

While cliff's team and my team
Are gonna go out a day later.

And hit areas closer
To asheville.

Doing it this way will allow us
To hit a lot more areas.

And hopefully find
The perfect spot.

Or our final
Night investigation.

So, I invited bud,

A buddy of mine
From the old punk-rock days.

Down in southern california.

Bud's always been a drummer.

He's drummed in tons of bands,
Most notably sublime.

We used to hang out
A lot together on the road,

Spent a lot of time with bud.

I took bud 'squatching
About 20 years ago,

Nothing happened.

We've been trying to get out,

But never been able
To coordinate it until now.

Bud, I wish you were There at
the town hall The other night.

It was incredible.

One guy I wanted you
To check out with me.

Was tim.

He's had ongoing activity
On his hunting property.

For five to six years Straight.

And what's most important
For us is year-round.

Really? Yeah.

No matter what season.

I've gone out
'squatching before.

But it was,
Like, all fun and games.

This is more of, like,
Almost "Csi" kind of stuff,

Where we're looking
Into specific evidence.

Luckily, I've watched a lot
Of crime-investigation stories.

So I think I got
My inspector clouseau on.

Hey, tim.
Hey, guys.

Beautiful spot, man. Thank you.

This is my friend... bud.

Hey, nice to meet you.

Yeah, thanks
For bringing us out here.

This place is killer.

Yeah, it ain't bad.

This is a real pretty part
Of the country.

You've got real mountains,
Steep terrain.

You pull up that little holler,

It's got rhododendrons
Over the whole flank.

I mean, it's just
This beautiful little spot.

There's little
Grass meadow areas.

It's the perfect spot
For deer and bigfoot.

Like, geographically speaking,
Like, where are we right now,

And how remote?

Are there homes In the area?

No. It's all national forest.

For hundreds of thousands
Of acres.

So, how far are we
From the appalachian trail?

Through the wood, 8 or 10 miles.

And if you know
The right ridges,

You can be there
A lot quicker than that.

And 'squatches know that.

Yeah, that's for sure.

Yeah, the reason
I brought bud up here with me.

Is because you guys have
Year-round action.

And most people
We heard at town hall.

Were mostly summertime
Or warm-weather months.

Just when we think
It's gonna quit,

It starts up again.

What would keep the 'squatches
Here year-round?

Is there something unique
About this area?

Is there a lot or animals,
Or is it warmer?

The weather ain't quite as bad
'cause it's shielded.

And also, We have feeders out.

That keep the deer And 'coons.

And that kind of stuff
Here year-round.

Tim is a hard-core
Year-round hunter.

He puts up game cameras.

With salt licks and deer feeders
In front of them.

That brings in the deer.

And the deer bring in
The 'squatches.

While it's never been caught
On a game camera,

Theres lots of stories
From hunters.

Of salt licks
Being carried off by bigfoots.

So, what was the first thing
You noticed here.

That made you think,
"This could be a bigfoot"?

I was setting up In this loft,

Waiting on a wild hog to come in
To a feeder in the yard.

And three 'coons come out
To feed at the feeder.

And all of a sudden,
They run back.

And something caught
One of them.

And whatever caught it
Started whistling.

And it would do that
And wait about 5 or 10 seconds,

And then It would do it again.

Did something answer it
When it whistled?

Not that we heard.

Then I tried to think
Of what could be whistling.

When you've been in the woods
As long as I have,

You pretty much figure out
What sounds the animals make.

And it was nothing
That I'd ever heard before.

We're you open to the idea
Of bigfoot prior to that?

Well, I'm one of them,
"Yeah, maybe" S.

But after that, we've sort of
Come to accept it, you know?

You just come in,
Don't bother them,

And hope They don't bother you.

On the way here, bud asked me
If you had any evidence.

And I said,
"Well, he's got photos."

Yeah. I've got some here
On my tablet.

One is where you can see it
Looking around a tree.

Is that a shoulder and a head,
You think?

Yeah. It's just about got to be,
Because the way that...

As big as it is
And the way that it slope,

It ain't a bear's head
Because a bear's ears...

Yeah... Are up on top.

They're not Over to the side.

And I don't think It's anybody,

Because I ain't seen
Nobody that big.

How big do you think
It is, about?

I would say...

Just guessing from the size
Of the tree and stuff...

Its shoulders would probably be
At least that wide.

You said that you had
A picture of a footprint.

Can I see that one?

Yeah. It's right here.

And we compared it
To my buddy's foot.

What size shoe does he wear?

He wears a size 10 1/2.

10 1/2?

And it's a lot bigger
Than he is.

That's pretty long.

I'd say about
Another 6 or 7 inches.

Longer than...

That's not a human barefoot
Running around.

If he is,

I don't want
To meet him, either.

This place Just reeks 'squatch.

I mean, this place,
You look around,

No one would doubt that
You had these experiences.

In this beautiful,
Little valley.

Yeah.
There's something going on.

And we can't explain it.

That's the reason I wanted
To get ahold of you guys.

Well, I like this spot a lot.

Bud and I have been buddies
For over 20 years.

And he's been wanting
To get out with me.

You mind Taking us out tonight?

<I>Well, I'll let you go.
I don't have my gun.</I>

And I don't go through here
Without some kind of gun.

At nighttime?

Nighttime, daytime,
Morning time, any time.

Wow.

If I hear someone's
Running from a 'squatch spot

<I>'cause it's too scary,
I'm running to that spot.</I>

We're gonna save some money
On gas tonight,

Because we don't got to drive
Anywhere to go 'squatching.

We going right here.

So, this is where we're gonna do
Our night investigation.

I reached out To my cousin laura.

To come help us investigate
These bigfoot reports.

We've always been close
Over the years.

But I've never gone bigfooting
With any of my relatives,

And I think laura would be
The perfect one for the job.

Laura and I are on our way
To meet with david davis.

And his two sons.

While they were out camping,

They believe a bigfoot
Was stalking them.

In the middle of the night.

Well, I'm really glad
That you're coming along.

Not just 'cause you're a cousin.
This is gonna be fun.

But additionally, laura,
You're a parent.

Who has two sons,
You know, about that age.

Right.

You have that insight
Of where kids have a tendency.

To maybe overreact
And exaggerate.

I may not be a bigfoot expert,
Obviously.

But what I can bring
To this investigation.

Is my experience as a parent
And a teacher.

Yeah.

You're working with kids
All day long.

You know How they tell tales,

Or you know how
They get excited in the moment.

And build something up
From here to there.

Right.

There they are. Hey, guys!

Hey. How are you?

Sweet, little spot Back here.

I understand why
You'd want to go camping.

It's absolutely gorgeous.

This is my cousin, Laura.

Hey, laura.
Pleasure to meet you.

Good to see you guys.

So, now that we are
At this location,

Can you share with us
What happened to you guys.

That day and evening?

Absolutely.

They were having A campout.

And having a little
Airsoft war party.

Somewhere during the middle
Of the matches we were playing,

The campsite
Just starts getting, like,

Pelted sporadically
Here and there.

With, Like, little pebbles.

It gets to be about, you know,
Late in the evening.

And so we decide To bed down.

It's about 2:30, 3:00.

We start hearing A lot of ruckus.

And a lot of noises
Like branches breaking.

And just around the perimeter
Of the camp out here,

Something huge
Just starts coming out.

And all of a sudden, Just, like,

The largest barrel-chested,
Deep-throated, guttural noise.

Just issues from it.

Where we've come to investigate
All the sightings.

Along the appalachian trail.

After an overwhelming number
Of reports at the town hall,

We called in our friends
And family.

To help us investigate.

Right now,
Ranae and her cousin laura.

Are meeting with witnesses.

Who had
A very strange encounter.

And all of a sudden, Just, like,

The largest, barrel-chested,
Deep-throated, guttural noise.

Just issues from it.

You could feel, like,
The tremors through the tent.

Every one of us
Were scared to death.

But then, it just meandered on
Out of the campsite.

Well, what was it doing
Out there?

Was it, you know,
Upright the whole time,

Or was it bending over?

Looked like it was just
Scouting out the place,

Seeing What was going on.

It just turned to us
Immediately,

And it was just like.

Something deep
And throaty like that.

And you could just tell
It was, like, barrel-chested.

And had come From deep within.

And you did feel like it was
Directed at the tent?

Yeah. It felt like
It was trying to intimidate us,

Like,
So we wouldn't do anything.

Did it work?

Yeah.
Absolutely.

So, you're positive,
All three of you,

It could not be a bear?

No.
I don't think it was a bear.

I mean, this thing
Stood upright and walked.

From as far as we had
A visual on it from there.

All the way Till it was gone.

So, I don't know
Of any bears that can do that.

This is exactly
Where the tent was?

Absolutely, yup.

And you had a campfire,
Which was located where?

It's just over there,
About 15, 20 feet away.

Probably right there.

And where was
The figure standing.

When you all saw it
Through this window?

Just right over here.

That's close.

Yeah. It was a little
Too close for comfort.

I'm definitely not saying
Nothing happened.

Those kids and that dad,
They were scared,

And they definitely
Saw something really big.

What they saw, I don't know.

So, now that
We are at this location,

We can try to get an idea
Of how big it is.

'Cause the whole point
Of being here.

Is we want to rule out
All other possibilities.

All right. Sounds good.

All right,
I'm gonna head over there.

And you guys tell me
Where I'm in the right spot.

Let's hop on in.
You can look through the window.

And we can get ranae
In the correct position.

Okay. Love to.

Okay, so it's this tree
Right here, david?

Yes, ma'am.

This one? That one right there.

Okay.

David, you mentioned
A particular branch.

Is that it right there,
Next to ranae there?

Yup. The branch right there
Above her head,

Where she's got
Her hand right now.

Okay, so the figure's head
Went by this branch?

I'd say the shoulders
Were probably square.

With that branch Right there.

Saying... Here?

Yeah. That's exactly it.

That's about 10 inches
Above my shoulder.

So, boys,
You saw it walking, right?

Yeah. And it didn't seem.

To be paying
Much attention to you.

Can you describe to ranae
How it was moving along?

Yeah. Just a slow, casual walk,

Just like The patterson film.

You saw its profile as it walked
Right here to pass these trees?

Yes, ma'am.

Kind of, like,
Maybe something like this.

Yes, ma'am.

A little slower.
A little more deliberate.

And then where did it stop?

It stopped right about In that
exact spot That you're at now.

Right here, okay.

So, you guys are opening
That zipper at that window,

And it turns
And looks at you face on?

Squared up with us, yup.

And then it growled.

Exactly.

Maybe not that vicious,
But something like that.

Rah!

You've heard bears growl
And grunt out here,

Or have you not?

I have, absolutely have.
Okay.

And it was not a bear?
It was not.

It lasted a lot longer
Than a bear's growl,

And was very much deeper.

And it could've just
Been the moment,

But it seemed Like it was deeper.

Than anything I've ever heard
In these woods before.

All right, well,
We've got the measurements.

I'm heading back over, Guys.

They're positive
That they saw a bigfoot.

But I cannot rule out
The possibilities.

That that wasn't a person.

They saw a figure briefly,
A few seconds at a time.

By a dimly lit,
Coal-based campfire.

Walking About 50, 60 yards away.

Still, laura and I, we're gonna
Hang out here tonight.

And do some investigating
Of our own.

We'll see if we can uncover.

What was really
Scaring that family.

While they were out camping.

Meanwhile, bobo and bud
Are gonna conduct.

A night investigation
Of their own.

Near a cavernous area.

At the foot
Of the appalachian trail.

Look at this.

Wow.

There's a nice rock overhang
Right there.

Might be a cave.

Yeah, it is.

This is pretty cool.

Mountain lion, bear,
'squatches... anything.

Why wouldn't a 'squatch
Chill up here?

I'm gonna try a whoop.

I'll bounce it Off the rock.

Yeah. Here you go.

Whoop!

Whoop!

Want to try to whoop?

Yeah.

Whoop!

Yeah. Whoop!

Dude, that's it.

Eat your heart out, Cliff.

Hey, laura.

This is a good tree
For a wood-knock right here.

Now we just want to listen.

And hopefully we hear
A response,

Hear a wood-knock back.

Actually, you want to do
A swing at it?

Yeah.

All right.

Batter up.

Nicely done, cousin.
Way to do grandma proud.

I have to admit, I'm hoping
For an uneventful night.

<I>I'm hoping for
An eventful night, laura.</I>

Yeah, I know you are.

What do you think?
What do you believe?

Do you think there's
An undiscovered bipedal ape.

Running around north america
Undetected?

A flesh-and-blood animal?

I don't think so.

It doesn't seem likely that,
You know,

Something would be so elusive,
Yet there's so many sightings.

It just... it doesn't seem
To make sense.

As a scientist,
As a field biologist,

I just don't see any evidence
That supports it.

However, I'm fascinated
By the phenomena,

And I would gladly
Be proven wrong.

We should move up this trail,
Hit another spot.

All right.

Hey, bud. Yeah?

I want to do A couple knocks.

Ooh!

That hurt.

Yes.

Damn.

That was bad.

Pshew, pshew!

That's what drums are,
Is hollowed-out trees.

You're a natural, bud.

Dude, you hear that?!
I did.

Bud, that sounded like
Wood on wood to me.

It was like
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

I think there was four.

I heard four.

Dude, I think I have something.

Carolina,

Where reports of bigfoots
Run rampant.

While ranae And her cousin laura.

Are in the midst
Of a rainy investigation.

On one part
Of the appalachian trail,

Bobo and bud are exploring
A portion of the trail.

That's riddled with caves.

And bobo and his friend bud
Just got something on therm.

Dude, I think I have something.

Right up there,
There's something glowing hot.

I don't think That's an animal.

Unless it's something
Laying down.

I think it's a rock.

But still, A rock doesn't knock.

So hopefully, if that was
Something knocking,

It knocks again
Or throws a rock or something.

Yeah.

It turns out
What we were looking at.

Glowing hot on the therm
Was just a rock.

But we definitely heard
Knocking sounds coming.

From that general direction.

So bud and I will go up there.

And see if we can figure out
What made that noise.

All right.
This is a good sign, bud.

Yeah, it is. Let's go find him.

Okay, laura, right here.

It's time To do a vocalization.

All right.

Let's go, cuz.

That was good. That was good.

Let's give it a listen.

Okay, I'm gonna try one here.

You got some lungs.

It's a family thing, you know.
Got good genes.

I can't help but wonder...

The knocks and the howls,
I would think...

You know, this creature,
I guess,

Has a reputation
Of being elusive.

I would think
That would make him run away.

Instead of respond.

I agree. You know,
Wouldn't you want.

To just be Stealth and quiet.

And hope you hear something,
And then just observe?

But the guys believe that
It's a technique.

That they can use
To draw them in closer,

And then they want
To videotape it.

Wow. It wraps around up here.

This is pretty epic.

You can just feel it.
Like, this is the spot.

I think we should do
Some calls from here.

You're right.

He would hear it
Through the whole canyon.

Should I do The angry growl?

Do what ever you feel.

You just got to channel
Enough force.

That was rad.

Bud and I definitely heard
Something out here tonight.

Something made those knocks.

We tried to get more responses.
Nothing worked.

We never figured out
What it was.

Think we need to find
Another spot.

For our final overnight.

With an opportunity
To bring in an extra hand,

I can't think of anybody else

I'd rather bring out
Than my older brother rob.

I really looked up to him.

And took after him
In so many ways.

Everything
From my quirky mannerisms,

Shockingly good looks,

And sense of humor
Can be blamed on rob.

And finally, rob's gonna
Come out with me.

On an investigation.

And hear firsthand
From witnesses.

What they've been finding.

I guess it's kind of like
"Take your kid to work" day,

Except that my kid is 5 years
Older and 4 inches taller.

We're gonna go visit
David and rex,

Two bigfoot researchers.

That have been working one
Relatively small area for years,

And claim to have
Ongoing activity.

And really important
Things, too...

They saw one
This time last year.

And, probably
Most important of all,

They have Some hard evidence.

They have A footprint in cast.

That they claim
Is one of the best,

<I>if not the best, Ever collected.</I>

Now, obviously, that kind of
Pricked my ears up,

And that's why I wanted to go.

Yeah, 'cause you have Your own
collection Of over 200 casts.

Exactly. I've got quite a few
Of these things.

But I think if you get
A good look at that cast.

And compare it To what you know.

From all the ones That you have,

You'll be able to tell
Whether it's real or not.

Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hi.

Little chilly.
Yes, it is.

Now, you guys have been having
A lot of activity.

On this property and nearby
For quite a while, right?

Yes.
Yes.

We actually operate a bigfoot
Research group out of this.

I have a dedicated team.

We've been on property
Now since 2013.

Well, back me up.

What's some
Of the earliest stuff.

That kind of started
Clueing you in.

That sasquatches
Might be in the area?

Well, the main thing
That we found, 2010,

Was a footprint.

My neighbor gave us a call.

And told us
To check something out.

So I got my camera, and me
And my brother went up there.

And when I saw it,
I was blowed away.

It made one footprint
Across this road.

It had to have a stride
Of over 6 foot.

And we decided
To take a cast of it.

Now, is that the cast
That you guys told me about...

Is the best one ever made?

The best one I have ever seen.

Okay. I think it's time.

I'd like to see the cast,
Please.

Okay.
Absolutely.

At cliff's house,
He has a shed in the back.

And there are shelves in there,

And it's lined with literally
Hundreds of bigfoot casts.

It seems to me
The casting of bigfoot prints.

Is cliff's life.

He can look at a cast
And tell you.

Whether it's legit or not
In just seconds.

It's interesting.
It's not super deep.

I do like The shape of the toes.

Now, cliff,
Would you expect the toes.

To be looking this rounded
Along like that?

In some cases, yes.

And, initially,
I had a brief concern because...

You see the steep ledge.

To the inside of the toe pads
Right there?

That can sometimes
Be indicative of a hoax.

Because the way, like, a plank
Would go out of the ground...

As someone walks across.

There are some things
About this cast.

That kind of worry me.

The heel impression
Is very distinct.

The toes are
Kind of squarish in a way.

And I've seen that before.

In cookie-cutter-style stompers,
You know?

Like fake feet, basically.

Now, I don't know
That's what made this,

Because we only have One cast.

No other casts To compare it to.

We almost have No information.

Okay, I understand
One of you gentlemen.

Has had an eye-witness account
Here at the property.

Who was that? What happened?

That would be me. Okay.

So, about this time Last year,

Myself and two other researchers
Were on property.

We were about 100 yards away
From where we're standing now.

When they thought
Maybe they saw some eye shine.

And something run
Across the property.

Right behind you guys.

So I walked off by myself
To try to find the creature.

Maybe less than 100 yards
Behind you guys,

I saw it step out,
Look from behind the tree.

Mber.

Of sasquatch sightings
Coming out of an area.

Near north carolina's
Appalachian trail.

We've called our families
And friends.

To help us investigate
All these reports.

And right now,
Cliff and his brother rob.

Are meeting with two witnesses.

Who've had multiple experiences
On the same property.

I saw it step out,
Look from behind the tree.

And this thing just gave me
A quick glance, stepped back in,

And it was over with That quick.

About how far away were you
At that point?

Maybe 30, 40 feet
From the creature.

That's pretty close.
Yeah.

So, how big was this thing
That you were looking at?

I believe it to be
Around 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall.

Okay. And that's based on
What it was standing next to?

Yes. So, I could clearly see
The full shoulder,

The arm,
And half of the head area.

Wasn't really a neck
That I can make out,

'cause, I mean, it was just a
Really thick, massive creature.

When you were at 30 feet away
From the creature or so,

And you were staring at him,
Were you just having,

Like, a stare fight
Looking back at each other?

No. I couldn't tell you
What it was doing.

When it looked at me.

But I had no fear
That it was gonna hurt me.

What else has been
Going on nearby?

Tree knocks,
Whoops, yells, grunts.

And we actually have gifts
That have been for us.

On the property...

Rocks that they have left us
On our trailhead.

There's clearly
Something going on.

On this property And around it.

This property looks perfect
For this kind of action.

And there's just
Too many little things.

That all kind of add up.

A lot of "Maybes" equal
A "Probably" at this point,

You know?

I cannot say for sure.

Whether that cast
Or any of the activity.

That's been going on
On this property is real.

<I>However, I do know.</I>

That there's a lot
Of bigfoot activity.

All along The appalachian trail,

So maybe they're here.

So, rob and I are gonna
Hang out for a while,

Wait for the sun to go down,

And then do our own
Night investigation.

Right where rex and dave said.

They've been getting
So much activity.

Here in asheville,
They really like their beer.

I think they like their beer.

More than they like
Their bibles.

There's more breweries.

Than there are churches
In this town.

Bobo found this one brewery
That has a sasquatch beer,

So we're gonna go
Check that out.

I mean, it's a given, right?

Cheers.

Got a good flavor.

That's pretty unique.
Yeah.

That'd be perfect... 'squatch
hunting With a sasquash.

<I>It's called sasquash?</I>

That is the sasquash.

Did a little spin on The butternut
squash That's in there.

Got it. Yeah.

'Squatching is thirsty business.

Beer is great and all, but
I'm here for what's left over.

After they make the beer...
The spent grains.

When you brew beer,
You're left over.

With all these spent grains.

And farmers'll come haul it off.

And slop it to their hogs
And chickens.

They report
When they put it out,

The bigfoots will come right in,

Not even look
At the chickens and pigs,

And just grab that slop
And just eat it.

It's like the breakfast
Of champions here.

It is.

I always thought
It would be a good idea.

To go to 'squatch
A little drunk, you know?

'Cause then they'd start, like,
Getting loud and loose.

And show themselves.

Kind of like me.

So, bud and I are gonna
Take some of that spent grain.

Out with us, spread it around,
Put some trail cams up,

And hopefully we bring in
A bigfoot.

If it doesn't bring in
A bigfoot right away,

It can still
Attract deer and pig.

And that can attract A 'squatch.

So, when bud and I meet up
With the rest of the team.

For the final
Night investigation,

We'll have a secret weapon.

Leo has been with me a few times
Before on expeditions,

But this is the first time.

He's come with me
To a witness investigation,

So it's pretty special
For him and for me.

Leo has heard me.

Talking to witnesses
On the phone many times,

So he knows the interview
Process that I go through.

I'm interested to see
What questions he'll have.

And if he's got
That investigation talent, too.

This is so great
That you came to help me out.

I know you've never been
To this part of the country.

Yeah, I'm stoked.
This is awesome.

So, who are we going
To meet right now?

Her name is kendra.

She was at
The town hall meeting.

Something wakes her up,
She looks out her window,

And she's saying
15 feet outside the window.

Is this big,
Reddish-haired thing,

And then it just turns
And walks away.

Wow.

So, when I'm out there With you,

What should I be
Paying attention to?

Is there Any telltale signs.

That I should kind of
Be looking for?

You know, that's just something
That comes from experience,

Because you get a feeling.

From somebody
Who's making up a story.

And you don't get That feeling.

From somebody Who's telling you.

Just something
That happened to them.

I'll be paying attention To her.

<I>The thing you should be
Paying attention to.</I>

Is the environment.

Think, is this
The sort of place that,

If you were a bigfoot,

You could skulk around
And feel safe and at home,

Knowing that nobody
Can easily shoot you,

Or even see you?

How you doing?

I'm good. How are you?

Very good.
Happy we found this place.

Yeah, it's kind of back there,
Isn't it?

This is my son, leo.

He's come out to help us
Check out some of these cases.

Hey. Nice to meet you.

When my dad and I drove up
On kendra's property,

The first thing I noticed is
That one side of her property.

Is facing other houses,

And the other side is backed up
Against wilderness.

To me, this is perfect.

It's almost like window shopping
For a sasquatch.

This is the window
That I looked out.

And seen it standing.

And where was it standing?

It was standing
Right down in that area.

Okay.

So, when this happened,
You're inside here.

And what are you doing?
What's going on?

It was christmas day,
2:40 in the morning.

I was laying on the bed.

Me and my husband
Had been talking.

I happened to look over
To my left.

And when I did,
I seen something standing there.

It was huge.

Trail.

Has had an abundance
Of bigfoot sightings,

So the team is here
To investigate.

After hearing
A plethora of reports.

Spanning the whole trail,

We decided to call on some
Friends and family for backup.

I flew in my son leo.

To help me follow up
With a witness.

Who had a sighting At her house.

Just a couple of weeks ago.

I look over to my left,
And I seen something huge.

I looked at it,
And I looked at my husband.

And I looked back at it.

It knew I was looking at it,
And it just turned.

And it was gone.

And I watched it for
Probably about 30, 40 seconds.

That's really long.

Wow. Yeah.

You turned your face
Right toward it,

And you guys were just
Facing each other?

Right.

So, what exactly
Did that look like?

Its face was not
Covered all in fur.

Around in here,
It was a darker flesh color.

So it was kind of like
A big, bulky, man-shaped thing,

Just with fur all over it,
Except for around in here?

Yes.

How tall Do you think it was?

As I looked out
The bedroom window,

It was taller
Than the bird feeder.

Then that's a big animal.

Definitely.

And I got my husband up.

And I told him, "There's
Something red out there".

And that "It's huge."

And he comes out On the porch,

And he could hear it take off
In the woods that direction.

It went down the hill
Through the woods?

Yes.

So, what is off that way?

Is it just pure wilderness,
Or is there more houses?

There's nothing from there
Way on down in the woods.

Wow. Yeah.

You know, I'd really like
To get a better perspective.

On what you saw.

So, what we could do is,

Leo, would you mind
Standing down there?

We'll tell you
Where to position yourself.

And we'll go back in there.

And have a look
At where her eye line was.

And get a feel
For how big it was.

And what it was doing.

Yeah. It sounds good.
I'll do it.

All right. Let's head on in.

Kendra says that what she saw
Was about 7 or 8 feet tall.

One thing I've learned
From my dad.

Is that people can be a little
Inaccurate with measurements,

So I'm gonna stand in
For the sasquatch,

Then see if it matches up.

Wow. And your head is Nowhere
near the top Of this bird feeder.

It might have been a 9-footer.

Leo, are you able to find any
Kind of a stick around there?

Well, I see some over here.

Okay, yeah.
Raise that stick up slowly.

Until I tell you to stop.

Is that... more? Yes.

More? About right there.

Yeah, right in there.

Boy.

That was a big one.

Yes, that was a tall,
Full-grown sasquatch.

I've heard that these things
Are 7 or 8, even 9 feet tall.

But once you see
How tall that stick is,

It really hits you
That this thing is giant.

And, boy, I would not want
To be out in the wilderness.

With one of those things.

Okay. Let's try and get a gauge
On how wide it was.

Stop.

Right there.

Wow.

That's definitely An adult.

That's a big, tall, Wide thing.

I'd say about 4 feet.

I'm so used to bobo helping us
With the size comparison,

So it was kind of new
With leo doing it.

But he did a great job.

Great. We're coming out.

All right.

And, you know,
Even bobo would have.

Had to get a stick
In this situation.

That was a tall critter
Outside this window.

Well, kendra, coming here,
Hearing your story,

Especially Seeing this place,

I have absolutely no doubt
There was a sasquatch here.

There is definitely
Bigfoot here.

No doubt about it,
Kendra saw a sasquatch.

And she told us that
Other neighbors around here.

Have seen them also.

So, that's great.

This is the perfect spot
To keep investigating.

So leo and I are gonna cruise
Around in a car in this area.

In order to cover more ground.

Meanwhile,
Cliff and his brother rob.

Are gonna head out
On a night investigation.

In rex and david's spot.

Do you see anything?

Just trees.

That's the great thing
About this spot.

It's so thick.
Anything could be out there.

Can I take a look
Through the therm.

To see What you're not seeing?

Yeah.

Are you seeing anything?

A lot of nothing.
Because the lens cap is on.

That would do it, Wouldn't it?

There you go. Much better.

Now I see it.

Why don't you film me.

So you can kind of see
What a mammal would look like.

Well, do a little dance for me
Or something.

Here, look, I'll do this.

And watch.

Kind of cool. Yeah.

Cool. Thanks, bud. Kind of cool.

Leo, we're not terribly far away
From kendra's place.

It's just across the river
In this direction.

I noticed On the aerial photos.

That there's an area with just
Big, open meadows up ahead.

I'm guessing there's probably
Gonna be deer in there.

And that's the area,
Around the perimeter,

That you want to look
With the thermal.

Okay.

And if you see a heat blip,
Just tell me to stop.

So, you got a grip
On the controls?

Yep, yep.

Okay. But go ahead,
Start therming out the side.

Look in the woods
To tell me if you spot deer.

Leo's been with me
On a few big expeditions,

But this is the first time.

It's just been him and I
Going around, and it's great.

He's getting to see
What I did for a lot of years,

Beginning about his age.

So, I think the last time
You came out with me,

We went out... was probably
In washington state, wasn't it,

On the olympic peninsula?

Yeah. When I was 9, I believe.

We were At the edge of a field,

And the moon Was so bright,

We didn't need any flashlights
Or thermals or anything.

It was amazing.

Yep, this field is cold.

Look, look, look.

There's turkey tracks
Over there.

Yep.

So that means
There's turkeys around.

Those are in the snow, so...

That's good.
Look for those, too.

That's good food For 'squatches.

You bet.

Do you mind if I, like, Get out.

And sit on this
For a little bit?

Sure.

Don't drop that therm. I won't.

Well, that's something
That bobo wouldn't do.

Yep, I see now.

What?

There is something.
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

Horse.

Sure it's a horse? Yeah.

Let's keep a goin'.

All right, robbie.
See, you can see the water.

Down there, the lake? Yeah.

That's good For two reasons.

First of all, If you can see it,

That means that our sounds are
Gonna go through the trees,

Because trees
Actually absorb sound.

Like sponges absorb water.

Yeah. We can see
Right through here,

So that'll be good. Yeah.

Okay, so,
I'm gonna do the first one,

We'll wait a little while,
Then you do the second one.

Okay.

All right. You up for one?

I'll give it a shot.

I have no idea what this
Is gonna sound like.

Well, that's part
Of the fun, isn't it?

For you.

Well, bigfooting
Is nothing if not fun.

Okay.

You're a natural.

Beginner's luck.

Those are geese.

That sound is traveling
Very well.

See, I think
That's another reason.

That sasquatches
Would want to hang out.

In a place like this...

Because
A really well-placed rock,

You know, would bring a couple
Of those things down.

If thrown right.

Boom, goose dinner.

It's like bowling.

We're close to the edge
Of the lake now.

Would it be a good idea
To go to the lake.

And try to therm Along the edge.

To see if you get
Any action that way?

You know, why not? Okay.

And who knows,
Maybe there's even prints.

Or something like that
Down there.

Hey, look at that.

Nice, deep valley In there,

Real wind protected.

Let's do some howls.

Let's do it.

All right. Here goes nothing.

Yeah.

Listen! That was definitely one.

Did you hear that?! Yeah.

North carolina.

We're investigating
A multitude of sightings.

Along the appalachian trail.

While cliff and his brother rob
Explore a property.

Where bigfoots are said
To repeatedly visit,

My son leo and I are spending
The night at a location.

Where a bigfoot was seen
Just weeks ago.

And we just heard
A bigfoot howl.

Listen! That was definitely one.

Did you hear that?! Yeah.

Yeah!

Was that...?

It's still going!

Yeah. That was one.

Yeah.

No, it was before those.
Those are coyotes.

There was a further one
That was deeper.

I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

Waaaaaaaah!

We could hear it
In the distance.

And it keeps going and going.

That's a sasquatch,
No doubt about it.

It kind of sounds like bobo,
But even bigger.

It's definitely a 'squatch.

It was deep.

Coyotes are in back of us.
That was over there.

I'm gonna do it deeper.

Do it again.

You see how much effort it takes
Driving around,

Checking things out?

You're kind of
Narrowing it down,

And then you just
Get the feeling that,

Yeah, this looks like the area
They'd be in.

And then you do it,
And there you hear one.

Well, we have
The water right at us.

We might as well
Do a couple calls.

You want to do them?

Can I whoop it?

You can do Whatever you like.

That was longer
Than the first one.

That's what she said.

Did you hear that? I heard that.

From that direction,
I heard something.

We got a response.

There's no other noises, Either.

That was A long ways away.

Obviously on the other side
Of the lake.

It couldn't have been An echo...

No. No, that wasn't An echo.

That far after.

How about I try to whoop,

Just to see
If I can get a response?

Yeah, and plus, you know,

We need to eliminate The
possibility That that's an echo,

Because it's possible
That it is.

You know,
That's a long ways away.

And it might Take that long.

For the sound
To get over there and back.

I heard it again.
Maybe that is an echo.

I think it is.
All right, you know what?

I thought you might have heard
Your first bigfoot.

But it turns out
It was just me and an echo.

That stinks.

Rob's initiation To bigfooting.

Turns out to be mostly
What bigfooting is...

A walk in the dark.

But you know what?

I don't tie my success
To only hearing sasquatches.

Fact is, I got to take
My brother bigfooting.

Right there is a success.

We know there's a sasquatch
In this valley right now.

And if we stick around
And keep making noises,

There's a risk it could
Figure out that we're humans.

There's not much else
We can do tonight.

With just the two of us,

So we need
To back out of here quietly.

And call it a night for now.

We need to come back here
Tomorrow with the whole team.

So we can use all that manpower
To our advantage.

With eight of us out
In the woods.

Making knocks and calls,

That's when we'll have
The best chance.

Of getting another response
Or maybe some thermal footage.

Matt and leo found.

The perfect final overnight
Investigation spot,

So bud and I are
Heading there right now.

We're bringing along our
Special, secret 'squatch sauce.

Hopefully that stirs us up
Some 'squatch action tonight.

We've got this spent grain
From the brewery.

We're gonna spread it
All around the woods.

Before the sun goes down.

That one's just right.

Hopefully, that sweet smell
Attracts a 'squatch,

Because I want to be there.

When bud has his first ever
'squatch encounter.

All right, folks.

This is our final night
Here in north carolina,

And it really paid off...
Bringing all the relatives here.

And split off
Into all these teams...

Because this is where
Leo and I heard this howl.

In this area where leo and I
Heard the howls,

There's a railroad track
Running across the mountainside,

So we're gonna split up
Into three groups.

Bobo and bud are gonna walk
One way down this railroad bed.

Ranae and laura are gonna go
Another way.

Along the railroad bed.

And the third team, Leo and I
and cliff And his brother rob,

Are gonna go up the mountainside.

To get as high up as possible
Toward an apple orchard.

That's on the rim Of the canyon.

Watch out For that ice there.

Whoa.

There are stories,

Some are even from hope,
Where I live,

Of abandoned railroads,

With these caves
That are really remote,

With 'squatches building beds
Inside of them.

But I think
This thing's still used,

So they wouldn't Live here.

But they would definitely
Walk through here at night,

Just like we're doing.

Whoa, what's that?

What is that?
Get my light.

It's ice.

Look at those icicles.

That's rad. Way up there.

Dude, a couple
Of those big ice spears,

Those like 6-foot ones,

They could fall at any second
And just kill you.

Yeah.

Definitely would, too.

Dude, I can't see anything.

I know.

Whoa!

Where are you?

You okay?

Yeah. I'm all right.

I mean, right now,
We're on this open...

Yeah... Area.

But you got an idea of it moving
Through the brush a few times,

We were doing that.

There's been sections
Where it is...

My god.

Sorry.

What was that?

I'm sorry.

I literally felt something
Pushing into my back.

Really? Like a ghost? Yeah.

Was it this?
Because I was trying...

Something vibrated In my pack.

This vibrated.
I bet you this thing went off.

It's attached.

Watch. I did this.

Is that what you felt? Yes.

Did you grab it,
And I didn't even see it?

Yes, and I was trying
To talk to you.

That was scary.

Look at that. Okay.

Couldn't have a better
Acoustical position than here.

So, rob, I mean,

I've been doing this
For over 20-something years.

This is only the second time
You've been out.

Hey, why don't you
Invite me more?

I don't know. I guess...

That's right.
I don't want to go.

That's right.

Well, now you see
Why you don't want to go.

It's too cold.

Did you think it was
This glamorous?

The glamour Is overwhelming.

Cliff, I think you were
The first one.

To ever bring me out
On my own little expedition,

And it was amazing.

Hey, matt, Can you copy me?

Hey, it's bobo.

Yeah, bobo, we copy.
Ranae, do you copy?

Go for ranae.

Okay, bobo, hang on.

Ranae's further up The canyon.

We're gonna Talk to her first.

Ranae, have you got a tree
Nearby you can hit.

That'll be loud?

No, but I can use These rocks.

You're gonna damage your
'squatch stick, but go ahead.

We'll listen.

Here I go in 10.

Yeah, I heard it that way.

You did?
Yeah.

Definitely sounded Like a rock.

It's good to have young ears
On the team.

Did you hear that, matt?

Leo's young ears heard it,
But the rest of us didn't.

Way to go, leo.

Okay, bobo,
Go ahead and do yours.

Copy. Coming up.

Yeah, heard it.

You heard it?

Even with the hood on?

It was like A low.

Holy smokes. Leo, good job.

I been in places
Where you could hear things.

That I couldn't.

Well, make sure that you keep
Your amplifier volume low,

And don't ruin those ears.

Yeah. That's pretty good.

All right. We're gonna do one
From up here.

Here you go.

I will make my first attempt
At a knock.

Done.

Negative. I did not hear you.

These two old ears
Heard nothing.

That was pretty good.

Shush!

I thought I heard something.

Yeah. I kind of heard that, too.

Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did.

Here, down that way.

Me, too. Shush.

Ina.

Following up
On widespread reports.

Along the appalachian trail.

After receiving
A surplus of reports,

We called our friends
And family to help.

In hopes of covering
More ground,

We split up into three teams
For our final night.

And so far,
The move has paid off,

As we just heard a vocalization
In response to our wood knocks.

I thought I heard something.

Yeah. I kind of heard that, too.

Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did.

Here, down that way.

Me, too. Shush.

Hey, we heard something
In the distance,

Almost like A bark response,

So we're gonna have him
Do it again.

Copy. We're listening.

Good.

Done again.

That's a dog.
That's what it was.

It was a dog.

Okay, we got a dog and a cabin
Down in the valley,

But that's okay.

Only 634 miles
Till we hit miami.

Let's pick up the pace.
We can get there next month.

There's a long,
Confirmed history.

Of sasquatch
And railroad tracks.

I can see
Why they would use this.

It's just like
A sidewalk, you know?

What are you looking at, Monkey?

Wabbit.
What is that?

A rabbit?

Or a possum.

I don't think
It's playing possum, either.

No. I wonder what killed it.

Something smashed his head,
Chewed his leg.

His leg's chewed?

You're right.

But then they stopped.

Strange.

We got to keep our eyes
Peeled and see what else.

If there's a predator
Utilizing this cave,

We'll see bones on the edge
Or something.

Good job, monkey.
Find some more stuff.

This'll work. Look at this.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I can see all the way
Down the hill.

Our sounds Are gonna go out.

Let's do some more knocks
From here.

Yeah. Good ideal.

I would hit it, like,
On this end or something.

We're trying to make it
As loud as we can,

So really swing that thing.

Got a knock coming.
Keep your ears open.

Knock in five.

All right.
Leo, that's your cue, man.

Beautiful.
Goodness.

Done. Did you hear that?

That's a negative.
Don't move... wait.

What'd you hear?

A thump?

Talk to us, leo. What's up?

A distinct knock.

There. There it was again.

A knock?
There's something.

I can't tell for sure
If it's a knock.

But it's definitely...

I heard it... twice.

Me, too.

We might have gotten
A knock response.

We did not hear Your knock,

And we did not hear
That possible response.

Bobo, you got
A place... a tree nearby.

That you can do Another knock,

Because we're gonna step up
To howls after we do...

Give knocks
A little more chance.

Copy.

That sounded better.

I heard it.

We heard you that time.

So, that means everything
In the valley heard it, too.

You hear that?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Which way?

Was it coyotes?

Don't know.

Hey, ranae, I think it's time.

For you to do a howl,
Not a scream,

But, like, a long howl
As good as you can do it.

All right.
I'll do one of those in 10.

That was impressive.

Thanks, cuz. Done.

You're in a very good
Acoustical position.

We're thinking
You should do it again,

If you don't mind.

Can you hear us, bobo?
I hear you.

Do you mind doing
A big, long howl?

Coming up.

Darn it.

I'm telling you,
It was right away last time.

Yeah.

It is so quiet tonight.

Now we've done a bunch of howls,

And they really did carry
Through this canyon.

And we're not hearing
Any responses,

Not even from coyotes.

And that's in striking contrast
To a few nights ago,

Because it was
Right after that first howl.

That we heard
A 'squatch respond one way.

And a bunch of coyotes
From another direction.

But tonight, nothing.

Whatever was here a few nights
Ago isn't here anymore.

Good timing.

It was like a cemetery mortuary
Where we were.

For up on top, man,
It was pretty quiet.

But when you go bigfooting,
You don't always hear something.

But if you can spend time
In the woods.

With somebody You care about,

That makes everything Worth it.

Yeah, I got to say,

We definitely got to come out
With family again.

Absolutely. I had
A fantastic time with everyone.

It was great out here.

And the family that 'squatches
Together stays together.

Absolutely.
Yeah, you got that right.

Let's go.

The appalachian trail
Is loaded with 'squatch reports,

And this north carolina
Expedition.

Just added to that belief.

But what made this trip
Extra special.

Is we got
To experience this place.

With our friends and family.

My son leo heard
His first ever sasquatch howl...

While we were out together.

On a father-son
Night investigation.

Being there with leo to see
His reaction was priceless,

An experience I'll never forget.

Yeah.

All of our night investigations
Here in north carolina.

Turned up possible evidence
Of bigfoots.

Bobo and bud heard knocks.

That were almost certainly
Sasquatch related,

And I heard howls...

On a couple of occasions.

Welcome to
The "Finding bigfoot" aftershow,

Where the team answers
Questions from their fans.

Okay, whitney t. From facebook
Wants to know,

"You guys were back
In north carolina."

By the appalachian trail.

"What makes that area
So good for bigfoots?"

You guys know this.

Yeah, we hear it everywhere
We go on the east coast,

I mean, from georgia,
North carolina,

New jersey, pennsylvania,

New york, connecticut,
Vermont, maine.

They all had great witnesses
That we heard from.

Right along that trail.

One moment that really
Stood out for me,

We were with 'boon-'boon
Up in new york state.

This baboon is gonna shriek
Like crazy.

It's gonna carry down
This long rift valley,

And the appalachian trail
Goes right through here.

This is the spot To do this.

Okay, 'boon-'boon,
Do your stuff.

Yeah. That's got to work.

And in georgia...
Upper chattahoochee drainage.

Remember we were there?
Definite knocks.

What was that place...

There was that preserve
Right outside of helen.

That wasn't very far away
From the a.T., either.

It suddenly got A lot chillier.

It did.

Cool. Did you hear that?

Do you hear something
In that direction?

I heard that.
Was that farther back?

I do think there's
A 'squatch in these woods.

"I do think there's a 'squatch
In these woods."

So, hillary in florida
Is asking,

"Howls or knocks"?

Which one gets us more pumped
To hear in the woods?

If you get knocks
From a 50, 70 yards out,

Like, bam, bam,
You're just like, "Whoa."

But if you get a howl
From close by,

I don't think
Anything tops that.

One of the very first times.

That we actually got knocks
On the show,

It was when we were
Investigating.

The new york baby footage.

Those were real close,
And blew both of our minds.

And, of course,
The producers' minds,

Because that was the first time
They had heard.

Anything like that. Yeah.

We have fruit. We have protein.

Man, get a couple carbohydrates,
Got a real meal.

Hell, yeah, dude.
It's my kind of place.

Whoa.
Whoa.

Did you hear that, cliff?
Yeah, I heard that.

Knock over there.

There it is again.

I got that one.

I got that one.

I didn't get the bead
On the direction.

Dude, it's right there.

But also the calls.

When you're hearing calls
From a close-ish distance,

And you're saying,
"That's not a coyote.

That sounds like
A big guy yelling,".

Or something like that...

Like the horse creek howls
At molalla, for example.

Those were close.

They were from
Two different locations.

And we got a great
Recording of them.

It's behind you.

That's a 'squatch.

I heard that Clear as day.

That's a 'squatch.

And hearing that knock
On bird mountain in vermont.

And then hearing the things
Coming down and marching,

And it was like,
That was awesome.

Dude, That was a knock.

There's something
Down there, matt.

Okay. They're moving.

They're moving. They're moving.

I think they're all going
Downhill, man.

Maine...
What a great howl I heard.

It was going toward That swamp.

It was late at night.
Definitely a 'squatch.

I didn't get it on thermal,
But, yeah, there was one there.

And that was the loudest
And closest I think I've had,

At least
In the last year or two.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Baby.

I don't know which one
Gets me more pumped.

Who cares?
They all get me pumped.

Yeah.

Okay, several people are
Asking what it was like.

To be out there with friends
And family members.

Fun.

Yeah, It was a lot of fun.

Yeah. You know,
What was cool for me.

Was bud actually got
To hear some knocks.

I mean, he's a professional
Percussionist.

He knows sounds.

He was pretty pumped.

Yes.

Damn.

That was bad.

You're a natural, bud.

Dude, you hear that?

I did.

That sounded like
Wood on wood to me,

Like knock, knock, Knock, knock.

I think there was four.

I heard four.

The moment
That stands out for me...

I was out on those railroad
Tracks with laura.

And she has Three older brothers.

Who have terrified her
Her entire life.

She thought I was just gonna
Be pranking her all night long.

I mean, right now,
We're on this open...

Yeah... Area.

But you got an idea about moving
Through the brush a few times,

We were doing that.

There's sections Where it is...

My god.

Sorry.

What was that?

I'm sorry.

I literally felt something
Pushing into my back.

She felt something
On her low back

'cause I was moving the arm,
And it terrified her.

She literally Went running.

She thought something
Was coming after her.

Yeah?
Yeah.

It was golden.

For me, it was great,

Because leo got to Hear a
'squatch for The very first time.

And it came right away.

I howled, and that thing
Came howling back.

It was just as good
As an ohio howl.

That was a 'squatch,
And he got to hear it,

And there was no doubt About it.

Listen! That was definitely one.

Did you hear that?! Yeah.

Yeah!

Was that...? It's still going.

Yeah. That was one.

Yeah.

I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

He was excited.

<I>He can finally can go home
And go, "My dad isn't crazy!"</I>

Or "...As crazy I thought."
