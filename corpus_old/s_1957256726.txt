[eerie rumbling]

[loud beep]


[cheesy spaceship sound]

Captain, I think it landed right over there.

I think you're right.

[cheesy sci-fi music]

What do you know about these aliens, Captain?

What do they know about us?

[servo motor]

[electric ray gun sound]


[audience laughter]

So is he, like, eating him?

[bassy music and outside voices]

Ha!

Hey!

What, are we out of beer?

Yeah.

Well, didn't you get two kegs?

I'm thinking.

Well, do something instead.

[sliding door opens]

Ah, lovely! Brandt's a pumpkin.

We're out.

Shit.

What are you supposed to be?

I'm this!

Grrrr!

I'm this!


[distant muffled music, drunk man's yells]

[music is louder now]

[loud rock music, people yelling and chatting]

Hey, you sexy bitch!

Oh, my God!

How are you?

Good! You look like a total fucking prostitute!

Thanks.

Good for you!

She wants a stoplight.

Finally. Jesus!

So did the fairies join the Army?

Yeah, I wish.

Thanks.

Yep.

What're you drinking?

Stoplight.

That's three different colors.

Green means "go," right?


[distant, muffled music and outside voices]

I'm a roofer.

Roofing sucks.

The suck-

It... The sun is so...

You can really see how beautiful everything is when you're up there.

And it's hard labor, and there's a certain fulfillment with hard labor.

I really admire that.

But what I really want to do is make movies

'cause I don't think there are enough good movies anymore.

Like, I wanna make a really real movie...

Like where the aliens come down to Earth and invade.

And have it be real.

I love science fiction.

It's not science fiction.

See, I think we as a society categorize it

so it doesn't mean anything.

That term just loses all meaning.

I wanna make a movie where the aliens come down to Earth and have it be real!

Not stupid.

[whispering and giggling]

[distant muffled music and voices]


Del!

Did you like my movie?

Yeah, it was good.

I thought some of the shots looked bad when the ship was landing.

Plus some of the sound was kinda bad.

Hey, what-
If you-

If you went out walking

wearing that costume

it would be really hard to hit you with a car.

OK.

You leaving now?

Yeah.

I'll see you later, though.

Good party!

[loud music and voices]

Hey! Do I have to be the only one on the dance floor?

Come on!

Fine.

[muffled music]

Nicki!

[drunken laughter]

What are you guys doing in here?

The hotbox is in the car.

In the car.

Get in the car!

[distant loon call]

[glass bottles clatter]

This is Del.

I'm gonna film the first scene of my new movie, The Invasion...

Part Two.

It's the sequel.

And I'm gonna take a look at the area right now.

Let's go... let's go take a look.

[body falls onto dirt ground]


[loud music and voices]


[eerie music]

[distant muffled music]


Do you know who you remind me of?

Who?

Kermit.


Kermit!

You know what happens to a frog when you kiss it?

He wants to go.


Go.

[car starts]


[clicking engine sound coming from car]

[clicking engine approaches]

You guys, I can't leave Nicki back there.

We'll go back.

OK. Where are we going?


Hey! Where are we going?

Relax.

Oh, God.

Come on, you're too uptight.

It's Halloween.

I can't leave Nicki back there.

We'll go back.

[ominous music]
[clicking as car passes]

We're lost, aren't we?

Turn the fucking car around!

[clicking engine approaches]

Oh, my God!

[screaming continues]

No!

[knife slice]

[screaming stops]

[shovel into dirt sounds]

Ah!

[truck's radio plays a commercial]

No!

Ah!


[distant hammering]

Del!

Dellio!

Look who showed up!

Great to see you. Go get the donuts.

[suspenseful music builds]

[talk radio]

[radio shuts off]

Run.

[determined music]

[sound of door locking]

[music trails off]

I can't confirm you were raped.

Is it a problem that I was doing drugs that night?

No. The toxicology report showed that you were fine.

There's no evidence to conclude a rape occurred.

No hair, no DNA, no semen, no vaginal trauma. Nothing.

Except the contusion on your thigh, there was nothing.

Wait, would these guys just stop what they were doing?

Just stop what they were doing?

He pinned me down!

And he pulled a knife out!

Take a breath. Calm down.

I am fine!

Calm down. Calm down.

They were going to do it!

Don't relive it.

[somber music]

It's the drugs, isn't it?

You don't believe me, either, do you?

No. I believe you. You were assaulted.

I want you to set up an appointment with Molly Glazer.

She's trained to handle this kind of situation.

Dr. Glazer. The therapist.

I know you're angry.

No, I'm not angry. I'm fine.

I just don't believe this.

[talk radio plays in the background]

Sure you don't want some eggs and toast?

Brandt, stop looking at me.

What?

Go to work or something.

Eat those eggs at least.

[Christmas music plays]

I'm gonna ask Rachel to marry me.

How long have you guys been together?

Three years.

You haven't been with anyone else?

No.

What?

What?

What? You think I'm being stupid?

No.

You don't think what Rachel and I have is special?

I think girls have their special secrets.

Not Rachel and I.

We can tell each other everything.

I mean, I tell her things that I never thought I'd be able to tell anybody.

You tell her things, yeah.

And she...

She's more loyal than I am, you know?

She's...

She's a great girl.

Yeah.

[tender music]

I'm just calling to say that I love you

and to see if you could get off work early today

because I've got a surprise for you.

Love you.

Bye.

Have you seen my checkbook?

No, I haven't.

I got it.

You know, I saw Rachel and that Casey guy is it?

At lunch today at St. Anthony Main.

Yeah?

[Christmas music plays in the background]
[other customers talking]

I mean, I can see there's a difference.

I just can't believe that this one costs so much more than this one.

Well, let me put it to you this way:

Is she your future wife?

Or your soulmate?

[tender music builds]

Are we going to our spot?

What are you doing?

Brandt! I'm freezing!

My frickin' feet are freezing!


You are an asshole.

Why are you trying to be romantic?

[music turns somber]

Did you do this?

You didn't do this?

No.

God, Brandt, you look so worried!

It's not that big of a deal.

That was our spot.

Well... we'll make a new spot then.

It doesn't work that way.

[car starts]

Craylis!

I'm detecting life forms, inbound at 500 meters.

Cut!

We should say, like, oh-800...

Or, you know, like whatever time it is.

Look at the sun!

Well, can I say, like...

oh-300 hours?

That's fine.

Why would he say that?

Does it matter?

All right. Well, it doesn't matter.

Yeah. It doesn't really even matter out here.

Well, why does it matter if they're 500 meters, inbound?

No, guys... OK... ready?

Action!

The Captain Craylis?

What? Just...

You don't need to say Craylis.

Guys. OK. Ready?

Action!

Captain Craylis!

Where are you?

Is that...

Is that the line?

No.

I'm confused.

I should, like, slide on the ice!

Ohhhhhh!

Oh, that would definitely be cool.

I mean, they couldn't shoot you if you were moving that fast.

[playful music]

Like the alien shoots you and...

Well, yeah, you could dump it off, I guess...

And you're about to get shot in the head and I...

...sliding sideways...

...I mean you could add the effects in later, but I think it would be cool.

Or they could be behind you and you think I'm gonna shoot at you...

[game beeps]

Are you trying to read my diary?

You're writing about your day, I guess.

Yeah.

[game beeps]

Oh, my dad said he saw you at lunch today.

Near St. Anthony Main.

Really?

I was there with some of my co-workers.

Who?

[phone rings]

Hello?

Oh, hey, Tara!

Uh-huh...


Yeah, I know...


[otherworldly scratching]

[talk radio]
...but Arnold Pike is the 4th missing person in two months...

Run.

[determined music]

Miss!

Miss! You dropped your glove.

[door buzz]

[otherworldly scratching]

I'm gonna film The Invasion.

[eerie wind sounds]


Bye.

You look good.

You looking good for work?

[door closes]

[sneaky music]

Next time, you call, OK?

Any time you're gonna be late I want you to call in so I know what the hell's going on.

I will.

We've been busy?

Yes. As a matter of fact I need you to, uh...

run out to Lakeville right now. Can you leave right now?

[distant voices]

[determined music]

[distant voices and laughter]

[music turns ominous]

[car starts]

When I say this, I don't want you to get mad, or anything.

You can't let this ruin your life.

You just can't, you know?

Nicki...

When I've made mistakes...

Not that what happened was a mistake.

I just...

didn't let it take me over.

These guys aren't worth it.

[mysterious music]

Hey, you done?

I'm gonna punch out in a couple of minutes.

Did you check on 9?

Debbie has it.

Oooh, what are you drawing?

Nothing.

That's neat.

So are you gonna go out dancing tonight?

No.

Why not?

I got plans.

Date?

Huh?

Is it a date?

No.

So you're not gonna go out?

No.

[distant angry yelling]

[angry yelling]

Joaquin! Stop it!

What is going on?

This fuck! He tell me how to, uh-

[angry yelling]

Shut up! Just be quiet! Stop it! Tell me what's going on!

He tell me not to, uh...

put the spoons in the dishwasher...

The spoons and the forks!

[angry yelling]

Oh, shut up! Are you serious?

Just be quiet!

Shut up! This is about putting spoons in the dishwasher?

I put the spoons in the dishwasher!

[water spray]
Hey!

[intense music builds]

[audio is silent as eerie music plays]

[knife slice]

[crying and sniffling]

Good night.
Good night.

[light switch]

[sheets rustling]

[steady breathing]

[TV clicks on]

[TV program plays in background]
...construction in your own home.

Kinda "do it yourself" kinda crap.

Me and Barry like to think that there's two rules-

...living creatures who produce light.

[loud punch]

...gives off 90% of its energy as heat

and only 10% as light.

[TV audio fades out]
[mystical music fades in]

Hey, Brandt, can you turn that off?

I have to get some sleep.

[mystical music stops]
[TV audio returns]

Sure. Sorry.

[TV turns off]

[mysterious music]

[paper tears]

[door knock]

[door creaks]

Hi, um...

Would you like some dinner? I have some left over.

No.

Um...

How about some tea? I just made some.

I'm very tired.

Um... chocolate chip cookie?

I'm very tired.

Oh. OK.

All right then. Good night.

Good night.

Don't forget the rent.

[mysterious music]

[steps creaking]

[otherworldly scratching]

[talk radio]
You're for it, right?

[talk radio]
Well, I... you know... I don't own a gun...

[talk radio]
And that's the choice you make.

[radio shuts off]

Run.

[heavy breathing]

[answering machine beep]

[voice on answering machine]
Hi, Susan. This is Otto calling. Otto Maki.

The man who found you in the woods.

Just calling to see how you're doing

and to let you know I'd be happy to take you out to the woods

and show you where I found you that terrible day.

[answering machine voice fades out]
[mystical music fades in]

[metallic thud]

[metallic thud]

Have you made any movies lately?

I could be in your next one if you want.

I mean, I could kill somebody, or I could get killed.

Or I could just be an extra.

I don't think I need you right now, Barry.

Well, keep me in mind.

How did you make that alien costume in the last movie?

Because that was really sweet.

Just lots of junk that I threw together.

Really? 'Cause it looked like it took you days.

How many square do we need?

Eleven.

They only sent nine!

You told me to order nine, Barry.

Hey, you dumbass! We only got...!!!


[metallic thud]

...because I was in the FBI and we were taking out these kidnappers.

Not in, like, the Die Hard office building

but more like the Winstar office building that my dad used to work at, you know?

Yeah.

[traffic noises]

...it was like George Bush and my brother.

Like first it was my brother and then it was George Bush.

And it was really crazy.

I was in love with Meg Ryan. In my dream, you know? She was like my girlfriend...

Hey, hold up.

Hey! Do you live here?

Man, just let him in.

Just chill, dude.

What are you doing? What's your deal? Do you live here?

Come on, man.

What's his deal? Let's kick his ass.

[somber music]

They kept asking me if I'd seen you that day,

or any member of your family,

or anyone else walking around out here.

I don't know if they thought I was a suspect or not.

You'll have to ask them about that.

One scary day.

They knocked me out right over there.

Never caught 'em, huh?

No.

Hard to believe that something like that can happen right here.

You don't think about things like that happening in your own neighborhood.

That there are actually people like that walking around out here.

You're lucky to be alive.

It's unbelievable.

Right here.

Right here is where I found you.

First thing I thought was some raccoons had

dragged a garbage bag out here into the woods.

They'll do that.

You were wearing that outfit, remember, but then...

Didn't take me long to find out that wasn't any garbage bag.

God, I almost had a heart attack.

I didn't want to check and see if that person was dead or alive.

You were alive.

Ice cold, but you were alive.

God, there's not a morning that goes by that I don't think about it.

I see the kids have been here.

This bridge board was damaged badly. Broken off.

I see they've already fixed it, and...

God.

[approaching footsteps]

Hey, guys.

Joe, go over there.

Joe, get over there.

Joe, this way.

OK, when I say "go," start running.

What am I running from?

You're running from an alien.

It scares the hell out of you and you're running as hard as you can.

Did you bring the alien costume?

No.

Ready?

Go!


Joe!

Do it again.

[a woman and man argue on TV]

You guys want me to start a fire?

I've got some wood out back that I need to chop, but...

I could do it.

No, I'll do it.

Hurry back.

[sliding glass door opens]

[footsteps crunch in the snow]

[footsteps approach]

[TV movie plays in background]

No firewood?

I couldn't find the axe.

Oh. We'll just have to snuggle then.

[woman's voice on TV]
I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.

[man's voice on TV]
Then I guess I'll have to return this diamond ring.

[woman's voice on TV]
Russell!

[man's voice on TV]
I love you today, I'll love you tomorrow, and I'll love you for the rest of my life.

I don't really feel like watching this anymore.

OK. Do you want to go?

Yeah.

[pulsing, ominous music]

[otherworldly scratching]

Yeah, see you.

Who was that?

[birds chirping]

[shovel scraping on shingles]


[bird chirps fade away]
[shovel noises get louder]

[bird sounds return]

[fabric tearing]

Del, what are you doing?

[loud impact on gravel]

Brandt.

Brandt, what are you doing on the floor?

Huh?

I don't understand.

Nothing.

My back was sore.

Are you sure you're not mad at me?

Why would I be mad at you?

I don't know.

Because I didn't let you watch your show?

You're gonna be late for work.

[playful music]

Shit.

[loud metallic crash]

There were three masks, all very detailed.

Almost handcrafted.

Like a porcelain or something?

No. Like clay or papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.

Ah... papier-mÃ¢chÃ©?

We don't really have anything like that.

Do you have a catalogue you order from?

Yeah.

Is that what you're looking for?

Yeah.

No, I don't think...

This is where we get all our stuff from and

they don't really have anything like that.

OK.
Sorry.

That's OK.

Thanks.

Actually, there's a guy I've seen

who makes kinda handmade stuff like that at the Ren Fest.

Do you remember his name?

[customers and background music]

Hi.
-Hey!

You make masks, right?

At the festival, yeah.

Why? Did you need something sooner?

For a party or a play or something?

Do you remember making these?

[ominous music]

So you saw these at the festival?

I saw three of them last Halloween.

One was green. It was smooth.

Another one was purple, and it looked more menacing.

And the third one was orange, and it had sort of a beak like that.

I draw them out first as kind of a reference.

I might have the one you're describing.

Is that it?

Who bought this?

I don't remember right off the bat.

You don't know?

They might be on the mailing list.

The mailing list?

[rummaging through papers]

My range is so large anyway.

I probably make close to 100 masks a year.

You can't find anything?

Oh. Wait.

Yeah, I think this is the one from that year.

I'd like to buy this from you.

You wanna buy the list?

Yeah.

Del.

Del!

You limping?

Well, anytime you need me, you just let me know.

Stand over there.

What am I supposed to say?

Am I gonna act in this movie, Del?

Yeah.

Is that what I'm doing right now?

Yeah.

OK. So what should I do?

What do you want me to act out?

Do you even need me for this right now?

Act like you're seeing a UFO.

OK. Where's the UFO?

Over my left shoulder.

What's it look like?

I don't know yet.

Just be scared.

Come on. Make your eyes wide.

Like that?

That good, Del?

Like this?

Like this, Del?

No.

How then?

Come on, Del. Let's say you saw a UFO.

Let's see your UFO face.

Let's see your UFO face, Del.

[melancholic music]

So are you coming back tonight then?

In, uh, two hours.

Bye.

Bye.

Well, the iced teas aren't free.

It says on the menu, under "Bottomless Drinks."

It's listed there.

No.

Yeah. In... it...

Under "Bottomless Drinks" on the menu...

It says...

It's listed there.

It's not under that list.

I wouldn't have ordered it if it wasn't.

And now you want me to pay for it?

And I've been waiting here for a while.

The iced teas aren't free refills.

Where's your manager? I want to talk to your manager.

Listen, I'll go get you another refill, no charge. OK?

I want to speak to the manager.

Settle down.

It's unacceptable.

I'm writing a check and we're gonna get the hell out of here.

I never would have ordered it, if it...
[voice trails off]

[Christmas music and customers in the background]

I'll pay for that.

I'm thirsty anyway.

You shouldn't have to put up with that. I'll buy this.

That's OK.

It's ridiculous.

You know, I should go out and...

...hit him...

...in the face.

Kick him in the face.

Those tall guys, they go down easy.

It's a center of gravity thing.

I'm tellin' you about it...

Right now.

[TV on in background]

Hey.

Hey. How was the show?

It was great.

Did you eat?

Yeah. I had some soup. But I'm still hungry.
[bathroom door closes]

Did you eat?

[bathroom door opens]

Yeah.

Do you want me to make you something?

No.

Just come to bed.

Brandt, why do you love me?


What?

Why do you love me?

I don't know... you're...

Pretty?

Yeah.

Smart.

Yeah.

What?

I don't know, that's...

They're not really good reasons to love a person.

They're qualities everybody has.

I mean...

You're funny.

I like your hair.

Well...

Tell me what you want me to say!

Oh, yeah. That would be real satisfying.

Well, what would you say?

That you love about me?

I don't know.

Now you know how I feel when you pressure me.

Good night.

You're not gonna sleep on the floor again tonight, are you?

Arnold Marion Pike was last seen on October 31st

[TV anchorman]

He's been missing since Halloween?

You're a friend of the family?

No.

Do you know Arnie?

No. Do you?

Yeah, I saw him a few times.

Talkative little guy.

Laughed at all my jokes.

Laughed a lot at everything.

It's kinda scary.

[urgent, intense music]

Easy, buddy.

[arcade sounds, kids talking and yelling]

What's his name?
David.

David?
Yeah, his name is David.

All right. OK. I'll check it out.

He's wearing a Superman hat.

OK.

David, please report to the DJ booth.

...could be back any minute.

[tape recorder - Rachel's voice]
Oh, yeah...

[tape recorder - Rachel's voice]
Uh-uh.

[tape recorder - laughter]

[tape recorder - Rachel's voice]
Well, he is taller than Brandt.

[tape recorder - Rachel's voice]
And, uh... and longer.

[tape recorder - Rachel's voice]
Not that it takes much.

[tape recorder - laughter]

[cheesy synthesizer music plays three notes over and over
D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...]

OK, here it comes.

[on TV, three notes play over and over:
D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...]

[on TV: ray gun sounds]

[on TV, three notes continue over and over:
D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...D#, A#, G...]

[end of TV sound]

Whoa.

What did you think?

Brilliant. I think you nailed it, man.

I mean... the music especially.

Yeah.

I mean, with the music, doesn't it make you feel trapped?

It does, yeah.
And horrified?

Yeah, horrified, definitely.

Yeah. It taps into something...

...that is, like, primal, sort of... I think.

Yeah. Kind of, like, the primal urge to, like...

...vomit.

What?

[singing three notes over and over:
D#, A#, G - D#, A#, G - D#, A#, G...]

Where are you going?

Home.

Del, making movies used to be fun.

Will thinks you're an idiot.

Why don't you just take a step back
and think about what it is I'm trying to do here?

Why can't we just make a movie like the last one?

Because that last movie was terrible.

You didn't seem to think so when it was done!

I don't think anyone-
What, did you become a master fucking filmmaker all of a sudden?

I don't think anybody liked that last movie.

And you think they're gonna like this?

Yes. Because this is real.

Yeah.

Real dumb.

[radio plays in background,
someone rummages through bathroom]

Why aren't you ready?

Did you forget?

What's the matter?

Is something wrong?

I'm fine.

I thought you were going to wear that sweater my parents gave you.

We're not gonna match.

Oh, no.

I would love to wear that sweater your parents gave me.

Because that is a great sweater.

Why don't you give me that sweater?

Did you even go into work today?

No.

I didn't.

Aren't you at least gonna shave?

[Christmas music in the background,
customers chatting]

Hey.

Hey.

How are you doing tonight?

Pretty good. How you doing?

Oh, I'm good.

Help any frustrated, bald jerks today?


Yeah, I could've used your help today with your...

low center of gravity... stuff.

Ahh... you're not supposed to hate your customers, are you?

I don't hate my customers.

So, you done for the day?

[Christmas music plays in the background,
people chat and laugh]

You want some of this in that?

Oh. Brandt doesn't drink.

The last time he drank, he ended up in the middle of the river

and he couldn't even remember how he got there.

So you better get that away from him...

[Christmas music plays in background]

[One loud, angry customer complains loudly in the background]

[angry customer]
...I will never in my life purchase a Mac...

Yeah, me neither.


God, how can you not go crazy some days?

Oh. So are we opening our eyes now?

Yes.

Did it work?

Yeah.

See? You can hear twice as much with your eyes closed.

Yeah, but everybody can hear that guy.


Well, I mean, this isn't a dance club, you know?

I hate dance clubs.

Yeah, me, too.

[angry customer complains loudly again]
...this fucking guy... I'm going down the road...

Yeah, bitch about it all the time. That helps.

And try to get everybody on your side.


Because it's all about who's on his side...
Right.

...and if they're not, then they can all just burn in hell.


[peaceful piano music starts]

Do you think people are too pissed off? In general?

Oh, I think anger is pointless, usually.

I think there are some things worth being angry about.

Really?

Yes.

Really, though?

Yes.

Are you angry with me?

No.

Do you wanna go out with me?


I don't even know your name.

Scott.

Scott.

I don't have any plans. I mean, we should go do something.

Like what?

I don't know. Let's go to church.

To church?

What? It's Christmas.
Did my mother put you up to this?

I'm sorry?

Nothing.

Church.

Sounds nice.

[angry customer complaining in background]
...oh, Jesus Christ!...


[on TV, Halloween party music plays]

[VCR fast-forwarding]

[on TV]
...it's the sequel.

[on TV]
And I'm gonna take a look at the area right now.

[on TV]
OK. Now I'm gonna throw it.

[Del continues to play three notes:
D#, A#, G - D#, A#, G - D#, A#, G...]

[on TV: Del makes spaceship noises]

[on TV]
Hey.

[on TV]
Hey...

[on TV]

[Christmas music plays in background,
crowd of people chatting and laughing]

Brandt, stop acting so creepy. Give me that.

Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

I'm sorry. He just...

...really shouldn't have anything to drink.

Don't apologize for me.

Well, seeing as how you weren't, I thought somebody should.

You'll apologize for everyone but yourself.

What is that supposed to mean?

You tell me.

You called me your soul mate.

All right. Let's go.

Sit down!

Easy, Brandt!

Easy. Take it easy.

Tell me.

Isn't there something you want to tell me?

What is wrong with you?

You know, I watch you write in your diary every night.

Like it's a living thing.

Only guilty people keep diaries.

They treat them better than they treat other people.

and he couldn't even remember how he got there...

...Brandt doesn't drink...

...Brandt's a pumpkin! ... my dad said he saw you at lunch today ...

... I was there with some of my co-workers ...

... What are you supposed to be?

...I'm this!

...well we'll just have to snuggle then...

[wet slurping sounds]

I don't know.

My notes end here.

What?

Hi, there.

What's up?

Arnie?

What now?

Leave.

Just leave.

[cheesy synthesizer music]

[music continues, with notes D#, A#, G highlighted]

How are you still alive?

I hit you with my truck.

I buried you... with this shovel.

I have major powers.

Where? How did you get your major powers?

Are you an alien?

I'm from Neptune, I know that much.

But does that answer your question?

Neptune?

Yes.

What are you doing here?

I inhabit a body.

And I can see what's... happens.

And that...

...tells me what to do.

What things are supposed to happen?

You'll have to figure that out for yourself.

Now you best be going.

I think I understand.

I think you do, too.

What are you gonna do?

I mean after this. What... what then?

I will go take care of that...

That...

...bad person.

Hey...

Don't get out of hand with your powers.

If you really are from Neptune,

I don't want you to get caught.

[guitar music builds]

Leave, Del. Leave.

[electric static]
[music builds to a crescendo]
