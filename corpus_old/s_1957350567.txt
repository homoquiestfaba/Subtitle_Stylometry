Corin, your mom just called and

left a message on the
answering machine...

something about dinner at
your grandmother's.

Wow...you're actually cleaning
up after your own mess.

Yeah, well, I tired of waiting
for you to do it for me...

Ahhh. Shit...

...so why haven't you
called her back?

I told her after 5 years it's
time she realized you're
not going away...

Awww.

...Is there something going on
between you and Elliot?

...You can't leave me!

...All they do is destroy
other people's lives...

Corin!!!

Jake...?

Corin!!

You took him away from me!!

The only person I've
ever loved!!!

...the only person... the
only person...

Jake?

Jake?

Jake?

The case of the murderous gay
love triangle took

another bizarre turn in a story
already fit for a
nighttime soap...

...a story already fit for a
nighttime soap...

A suicide note found alongside
the body of Jake
Verbeten confessed

to the set up framing of Marti
White for the murders of

Elliot Hamilton and
Corin Buckman.

Jake Verbeten's body
was found by his

upstairs neighbor and
friend Maggie Grace.

Discovery of the note has
prosecutors speculating the case

against Marti White will be
quickly dismissed.

What your step, uh, Eli...?

Yeah.

Sorry. I'm terrible with names.

Where did you say you were from?

Um...out west - California.

Oh. Good. Maybe you can bring a
little color and style
to this city.

We're sort of stuck in the 80s;
you know, big hair,
stone washed jeans

back from when they were
originally popular.

Girls named, uh, 'Cheryl,'
'Debbie' and 'Lisa?'

You got it. Come on.

Well, as you can see it's
fully furnished.

On site laundry, two full baths,
a Murphy bed in the bedroom,

three entrances and a
private patio.

How long has the
furniture been here?

Oh...it's from the previous
renters. The family didn't want
most of the big stuff

so they left it behind.

That's just the furnace
and a storage area

and there are some additional
items in there too.

What happened to the
previous renters?

Um, long story...they
both passed away.

What? Here in the apartment?

No...no... Well - yeah.
One of them.

Well, was it carbon monoxide,
or...?

No no. Nothing like that...

Just, um, some bad
circumstances.

But nothing involving the
apartment itself.

So - let me guess. You lived
in West Hollywood?

Um...Yeah. How did
you know that?

Just figured. I've been
there a few times.

So...what were you doing in
West Hollywood?

I don't know. I tried to
'find myself' there.

Get a music career started.

Um...I think I got a little more
lost than I was already.

So...Maggie. Are you a fruit
fly or a fag hag?

Um - what do I look like?

Oh - you look like a fruit fly.

It's just, um, you're not
wearing your Prada.

Well, they didn't
match this outfit.

Something tells me you could
make it work if you
were in the mood.

Yeah, well...I haven't been in
much of a mood for
anything lately.

Understandable. I think we can
both share in that.

Misery loves company.

So you came to Racine
for a new start?

Couldn't you at least have
picked Boystown or something?

It's a little less drastic.

Yeah. I know. Um, I've got a job
interview later today,

so I figured I'd take the
morning to look around and
size up the city...

And... what do you think of our
little city so far?

It could use a touch
of Nate Berkus.

Hmmm - I could use a touch
of Nate Berkus.

Yeah...who wouldn't?

Anyway, I've got family nearby
so it's a good place to
be for right now.

How much are you asking for?

$785 a month.

If you're really interested I
could forego the
security deposit.

You just really need a renter?

Well, sure, but what I really
need is someone around here
with a personality.

So what do you think?

I think you've got a new friend.

Yeah!

Um...I've gotta run, but, uh,
can I call you later
about the details?

Sure.

Cool. It's great to meet you.

You too...

Thank you.

You're welcome.

I don't think it's right to
mingle with that type...

Hello, Jamey...

You're 45 minutes late,
Snookums... and don't you
roll your eyes at me!

Just cancel my appointments for
the day. I'm not coming in.

Nancy! The Krekling account
people are...already here...

Tell them I've got the Bird
Flu and reschedule.

This is the reschedule! What am
I supposed to tell him?!

Alright, fine. Offer him a blow
job. I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

It's been nearly two years since
a gay love triangle
ended in bloodshed,

and a story made for a
nighttime soap opera.

But many believe the shocking
story has reached its
final chapter,

as the last of the debris from
what has come to be known as
'The Horror House,'

was cleared away to make room
for the newly
expanded Highway 32.

The road was opened today in the
spot where Elliot Hamilton

is said to have murdered his
secret lover, Corin Buckman,
in a jealous rage.

Hamilton's fiancee, Marti White,
was originally believed
to be involved

in the murders of both men, but
was cleared when
Buckman's other lover,

Jake Verbeten, left a suicide
note clearing Marti White of
her involvement.

The house was also the site of
an unrelated massacre
back in 1988,

and with many of the trees
around the land dying,

growing rumors and an
urban myth claim

the house itself was the cause
of its occupants' insanity.

You're late.

You know, Emily's a
time pincher.

If she forgives you and still
gives you the job,

she'll still hold it over your
head for the next three months.

Come on.

Yes?

You're 11 o'clock is here, Mrs.
Hamilton.

Show him in.

Good luck.

He'll need it.

Thank you, Brielle.

And Brielle... This
isn't a brothel.

Have a seat.

I believe our interview was
supposed to begin 15
minutes ago.

I'm...really sorry.

Um, I just don't really know my
way around town yet.

Oh. Well, let's take a look at
your portfolio and

I'll decide if I'm going to give
you one 'get out of jail free'
card.

Thank you.

Any pictures of women?

Um - no.

Any particular reason?

Well... I'm gay. The male form
just catches my eye.

My art is based on
discipline and structure,

but it would be nothing
without passion.

I see.

Now, you do know that
this magazine

is geared toward women -
Christian women?

I'm completely capable of
capturing the essence
of any subject.

As long as the pay is
good enough - hmm?

Well . . . I am very
impressed with your work

and your attitude.

I'll give you a call
in a day or two

and let you know my decision.
May I hang onto this?

Absolutely.

Good. Thank you.

Thank you.

Where did these come from?

A co-worker who wanted to
see you smile.

Oh, Jamey. You didn't
have to do that.

Yes I did. The florist was
flirting with me.

Mmmmm...cute guy?

MMM nnnn...Girl!

She made me feel all masculine
and stuff. So uh...

Admit it, Jamey.

There's a big gooey
heart in there.

Sssh. Nasty rumors will-will
totally destroy my image.

You don't have to run away.

Mmm Hmm, Mmm Hmm - I do!
I'm starving.

Do you want anything from
Henry & Wanda's?

No, I'm good. Thanks.

Okay. Toodles.

Excuse me.

The office guy wasn't
downstairs and

I needed somebody to
sign for this.

Maybe I should've said
'office girl.'

Excuse me?

You know...?

Why don't you check your
humanity at the door.

Hey.

Oh!

Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

I called out but I guess
you didn't hear me.

Oh...no - that's cool. I-I'm
sorry about snooping.

Oh no - That's okay.

Anything in here is free
for you to use.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

You wanna help me with these?

Sure.

You know, there are some posters
that would look better...here...

Really? Which ones?

Moulin Rouge on the left and
Madonna on the right?

Eh. Not every gay man is as
obsessed with those two...

Are you okay?

Yeah... Yeah.

I just thought it would look
better this way.

You know what? I'm being psycho.
It's your place.

You know what? I think it would
look better the way it
originally was.

No no no. I'm being silly.
Really.

No no. You know... I was... I
was just trying
something different.

I really like it the other
way much better.

We now return to "Night of
the Living De-..."

Stupid horror movies...

You are no longer my son...

Corin did this to me!

I swear I can't control
what I'm feeling!

You are just like your father!

Hello?

It's Maggie.

Ugh. Come on in.

Thought I'd try to stop by
without scaring you.

Thanks. - Hey, I was just about
to go for a bike ride.

Would you like to peddle along?

No thanks. My beauty
comes naturally.

Anyway, uh, so me and my friends
are going to Club Icon

on Thursday night and I thought
you might wanna go.

What's Icon?

An old gay bar with new name and
a really cool place.

Ahh. You go to gay bars.

Oh yeah...fruit fly.

I don't know.

I'm not a big fan of the
queer socials.

Why not? You're adorable.

The boys would be on
you in seconds.

That's exactly why. They're
just meat markets.

And it's so cliched. Big boys
acting like big girls

and twirling and doing drugs
and smoking and...

Don't you ever go out and
socialize, honey?

I go to gay friendly
establishments.

Integrate into society more.

Besides, the boys at the gay
bars are just one-nighters.

How do you meet guys?

I meet the gay boys brothers.

I like my men gay.

Well - that's not going to find
you a husband, Grace...

Excuse me.

Hello?

Ooohh - lucky banana.

Apologies. I didn't expect you
to be so overwhelmed by
my appearance.

Do I know you?

No. I'm George - and you
must be Maggie.

Eli tells me that you visit him
frequently here and

since I know that he doesn't
have any other friends...

Are you his dad?

Well, I was going to say
'older brother.'

Hi. When did you get here?

Oh, just a few seconds ago. Just
stopped by to see the new place.

We've already done the
introductions.

I was just about to explain our
'father/son' bond...

Ohhh... Eli didn't tell me you
were such a beautiful
young woman.

He called me young.

Yes - he's quite the charmer.

I was just about to go
for a bike ride.

Oh. Who were you on
the phone with?

My new boss. I just got the job.

That's awesome!

Well - it must be nice to have a
pretty cheerleader
excited for you.

Oh, if only you were older.

Long chocolate hair,
chestnut eyes...

Oh, he's good. I think I have
just the lady for you.

I can't believe I let you talk
me into this Maggie.

No. He's late and I
should be at work.

Yeah, a blind lunch
date...that's hot.

Oooh...it is hot. Gotta go.

Nancy?

Yes.

I figured it had to be you.

No other reason for
a pretty girl

to be sitting all by
herself at lunch.

Seat.

Sorry for my tardiness.
I took a fall.

Oh no...

Oh - it gets better.

The karma gods are not
pleased with me today.

What did you do to
tick them off?

Just being me.

Ride your bike, man!

Beautiful.

Awesome.

Okay, Reagan, put your chin
up a little bit.

There you go.

Smile. Smile.

Well, he certainly seems
to know his way

around better than the last
retard you hired.

I can see that, Dick.

He's very intense...mysterious.

Awesome!

You are gorgeous.

Smile.

Do I have to give you a
raise so that

you can afford a 'complete'
outfit?

Awesome.

There you go.

I was quite impressed
with you today.

I'm really excited to
see the results.

I think you'll be pleased.

You know, Eli, I was a
bit taken aback

by your confession of your...
orientation.

I'm not ashamed of it.

I can respect that it
inspires your work, but,

I would appreciate you keeping
it at home, and out
of the office.

Well, I've always kept my
personal life just that...

Personal.

I'm sorry for being so brazen.

I grew up in a very
religious household.

It wasn't something
we discussed.

Then I found out that my
husband was gay.

After 8 years of marriage.

That had to have been hard.

I didn't even know what gay was.

I literally didn't know such
a thing existed!

I think it would make for
a great memoir.

Well, I think, it is best, to
leave private affairs...private.

My son used to play the piano.

It was the only thing he was
ever really talented at.

Oh. It's not a very motherly
thing to say, is it?

It's better to accept the truth.
Music makes the world go round.

I've got tickets to Anne
Murray next week.

Oh, I love Anne Murray!

But aren't you just a...

...a little young to
listen Anne Murray.

I don't think so.

I think that if more people
listened to Anne Murray,

there would be fewer
assholes in the world.

I'll drink to that.

Marti.

Marti!

Pick up on aisle 4.

So, you're settling into
the apartment?

Almost done. Just a
few more boxes.

That's too fattening.

I'm the one filling
your cupboards,

so you might want to be a
little less pissy.

How's the new job working out?

Fine. I'm going to a concert
with Emily next week.

Oh, good. Gets you in
closer with her.

How's things going with Nancy?

Oh, very good. We have a
picnic date on Sunday.

Well, I guess that's
good for you then.

Could you not do that right
in front of me?

So you came here just to
keep an eye on Eli?

I know it sounds a bit
overprotective...

Yeah, kinda.

He'll always be my boy.

So what about you?

Why is a lady with a face and
figure like yours

not being clawed after by
every man in town?

Because men my age are either
married, fat or gay.

Besides, I always seem to find
myself attracted to gay men.

So you've never been
serious with anyone?

Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I was
married for 3 years. No kids.

And then he became jealous of
my modeling career.

You modeled?!

Don't sound so surprised.

Well, what was that like?

It was the best time of my
life - and then

I started to grow
older...America's biggest sin.

Hold on a second...

Very nice. And you just
walked away from it?!

More like I escaped.

Well I think you're still an
absolutely gorgeous woman.

All America wants to see are
sexy young things writhing
around on each other...

Don't you?

How you doin'?

Fine.

Yeah. Not exactly having the
time of your life, huh?

Come on. Let's go get
another cocktail.

I'll be right back.

Oh...I'm sorry. I'll - um...

It's okay.

Do you want another drink?

Uh, no. I'm half full.

Oh - my my my. Fresh meat.

I don't think I've ever seen
you online before.

Well that's because I prefer to
meet my fuck friends in
person first.

You'll have to excuse Chantal.

Her southern manners keep going
further south than her jowl.

Josie, grrrrrl. I see they
finally let you out of prison
and...(sniff sniff)

by the smell of things you're
definitely missing
those showers.

Come on, Evillyne. It's time to
hop on your broom and scare some
other little boys.

Snag him, Lambchop. You two
would make an adorable couple.

Well, that certainly wasn't how
I pictured meeting you. I'm Red.

Oh, I - I'm Eli.

Do you wanna dance?

Oh, no. It's - it's not you.
It's just, um, I don't really
get into all that twirling

and, stuff, I guess.

So - how about a cocktail and
some nice conversation?

That I can do.

No. My family is wonderful.

I bring boyfriends to holidays,
family functions...everything.

So - lots of boyfriends then,
huh?

No. Just two in the
last nine years.

You're not like a lot of the
guys here, are you?

Hey...

I kind of have a...situation.

Alright. I've left you boys
alone long enough.

Hmm. Good job?

Farmer.

Hmm. Shoulda guessed.
Gotta truck?

Yeah.

Good family?

Somewhere between '7th Heaven'
and 'Eight is Enough.'

I see.

Hung?

Okay. Time to take the
size queen home.

Home?! We have an
after bar to hit!

Okay!

Alright! Let's go let's go!

I had a great time. Bye.

Ugh...Lord! Lightweight. How
much did you have to drink
at the afterbar?!

I miss him?

What? Who?

I miss him.

Who?

I...

No no no no no no -
don't read that!

Why?

Come here...come here...uhhh...

I'm not afraid of you, Elliot.

We'd like to get there
before tomorrow, Eli.

Seriously. Just go without me,
alright?

I've got to get ready for
the concert anyway.

Exactly how many did you
tie on last night?

Just a few.

With who?

Just Maggie. It's no big deal.
Okay?

Yeah. Well, I've heard those
words out of your mouth before.

Hey guys, it's fine. We can
do this next week.

Mom?!

What are you doing here?

What's she doing here?

Mom, what are you doing here?

Who's that? Another victim?!

I thought I told you I didn't
like you hanging out with him!

I take it she's the ex?

Well let's just say that Hillary
and I are not overly fond
of each other.

I thought we had an agreement
that he's a bad
influence on you.

It's fine, mom.

I'm just trying to
look out for you.

That's a change of pace.

Nice.

I'm sorry.

Look - I just wanted to see you.

I had to go to your old landlord
to find out where you live now.

I mean weren't you ever going to
tell me where you moved?

I don't know how long I'm
going to be here,

so I didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.

I would have called you
at some point.

Look...I don't care what you do.

I don't care who you see.

I just want to be a
part of your life.

Okay? I'm trying here.

I know.

You know you're Uncle Bob just
came out of the closet recently.

Maybe this whole thing, it comes
from my side of the family.

Christ, mom, it's not a disease.

No, I know, but I saw this Oprah
show where they...

Oprah didn't grow up inside
of my head - I did!

No - I know. But this is not
about what's going
on with you...

It is not! It's about you
connecting with that scumbag
in there and not me.

There's a big difference.

No offense, mom, but he's been
around for me a lot
longer than you have!

Oh...

Maybe it was your grandfather.

Drop it, mom.

Honey...

Look - I'm really glad you came
here, I really am,

but right now is a really bad
time. I have to get going.

Can I see you tomorrow?

I don't know.

I love you.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Okay.

Dick, there is no way they can
do that. I told you.

Hang on... Ah, come on in. I'll
be finished in a minute.

You just make yourself at home.
Go right in there.

Okay.

Alright. Listen to me, Dick.
It's not that....

Give it everything you've got,
you're your own worst enemy.

No, Dick, no. We have a
contract. There is...

Drinking spirits taking shots,
glass still...

...remains half empty.

Uh, no. We're going to have to
talk about this tomorrow.

Yeah - bye bye.

The love I give will never stop.

You don't wanna wait and see
it's sweet suicide to my life,

saving you every time, I
catch you half alive.

Wish I could compete...

with your perfect goodbye.

the sweat of your
thousand tries,

the threat of the same blue sky,
so sweet....

I'm sorry.

It's - it's okay.

I - I miss having a
piano at home.

Those prose were just beautiful.

Well, um, I - I wrote
them myself.

Oh - let me get you a kleenex.

Oh, no no. It's fine. It's
barely a paper cut.

We should get going.

Okay.

Has anyone in the office talked
to you about my son?

I've heard mumblings.

I figured. Elliot certainly did
leave an impression...

just not the kind I'd hoped for.

I know plenty of details, and we
don't have to go into it if
you're uncomfortable.

You know he was gay?

Yes.

I blame myself.

For him being gay?

No no. No, not that.

For not accepting it.

But mom!

Get out of my house!

I think I was at fault for
his losing touch...

I wasn't there at the precise
moment he needed me most.

But you know what's ironic?

I didn't want my parents to
know. They already knew!

They blame me. Yeah...

It's not your fault.

No. My mother said to me,

'You put yourself before your
son, and that makes you
a bad mother.'

Didn't Elliot have a girlfriend?

Yeah. Yeah, Marti.

Well whatever happened to her?

I don't know.

The trial ended with that
young man's confession,

and then she just disappeared.

I called her brother a
few months ago,

but he didn't know where
she was either.

You know, I couldn't tell if he
was embarrassed for her...

or of her.

Family sucks.

Mmmm. Look.

What is she? 16...17?

She's gonna have that baby,
and after a month of

not being able to hang out with
her friends at the mall,

she's gonna dump it off on her
parents and go on her merry way.

The kid will grow up
lost and alone,

and blame the rest of the world.

Oh - we'd better get to Anne.

Okay. Let's fly, Snowbird.

Handsome fella.

That's Corin. One of my favorite
people in the world.

Well, you certainly have plenty
of his pictures around here.

Should I be worried?

No. There's no need
to be jealous.

He's not with us anymore.

Oh.

Besides, even if he were he
wouldn't be much of a threat.

Too conceited?

No, too gay.

Well, you certainly seem to
support the rainbow flag.

Yeah, I do. Don't you?

Can't say I've had too many good
experiences with it.

My wife wasn't a big fan of it.

Took away so much from my son.

Shouldn't you be more open
minded since you're son is gay?

Let's not discuss my son.

Well maybe you just left it
open and forgot.

I have central air, Maggie.
I never open them.

And the cops didn't
find anything.

No. They searched the whole
place. Nothing's missing.

Well, do you want me
to come over?

No no. George will be here in a
little while. I'll be fine.

How's that going?

I'm not sure. At first we had
this really great connection.

The same kind I had with Corin -
minus the queer part.

So what's the problem?

I can't put my finger on it.

Whenever I start to dig
he pulls away.

Is the sex at least decent?

That's just it! We still
haven't done anything!

I mean I understand the myth of
waiting until you're in love,

but what guy would not put out
when a woman offers,

especially after three weeks?!

He barely kisses me!

Well - you know, you have a
knack for dating gay men.

No, he's too homophobic.

Do you think he could be
a closet case?

Nancy?!

Jesus George!

Gosh, I'm sorry.

What's going on?!

No no. I'm fine.

George can't seem to make an
entrance like normal people.

He always has to make
"an ENTRANCE!"

Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Bye bye.

What?!

One of these times you're
going to catch me with

a knife in my hands and you'll
be short one nut.

My car broke down.

I can not believe you were out
in this storm anyway.

You know we have a tornado
watch until 1 a.m.?

I never concern myself with
stuff like that.

If God wants me he'll get
me wherever I am.

Oh.

Are you sure this is okay?

You're soaking wet, Elliot - uh,
Eli.

Elliot was a little smaller than
you, but these should
work for tonight.

You know, un, I can call a
cab to take me home.

Don't be ridiculous. Now you
just sleep here and

we'll figure out the car
situation in the morning.

I - uh, I'll go put
on some coffee.

Marti?! Marti?!

I just needed to get away
from everything.

But you could have said goodbye.

At least let me know
you were okay.

You were one of the
reasons that I ran.

I just couldn't look
you in the eye.

You remind me so much of him.

But there's something else that
brings back Elliot to
me every day,

and I've tried to deal with it
the best that I can,

but I really think that
you're the only person

that can help me deal with it
the way that I should.

Oh - oh Marti, this is Eli.

He's my staff photographer.

Hi.

Mrs. Hamilton, I -
I've got to go...

Marti? Marti?!

Goodnight, Elliot.

Are you sure about this?

You don't have a car.

Now you use this until
yours gets fixed.

Come on, go on.

Oh. I told Elliot repeatedly
to get that fixed.

No, no. It's fine.

Thank you for letting
me use his car.

Are you okay?

Yes. Y-yeah...I'll be fine.
Excuse me.

You've got to be
fucking kidding me...

Oh hey, I haven't seen
you in a while.

Can I put these in Mrs.
Hamilton's office?

Oh, you can leave them
here with me.

No, that's okay. I'd rather put
them there myself.

Oh, I really like the angle of
my jaw in this one.

Oh, we have a visitor.

What are you doing here?

I don't know what you mean.

You're living in that house.

You're driving Elliot's car.

You're spending time with
her at her house.

You work for her!

I'm not following you, Marti.

I want you to stay
away from her.

Your kind does nothing but evil.
Stay away!

He's only 5 minutes late.

He's always only 5 minutes late.

People irritate me just
by breathing.

So the whole world
revolves around you.

Yeah. Sometimes it does.

Other times I'd just like a
little common courtesy,

but that doesn't seem to exist
now anymore, does it?

Ah, courtesy - as in
showing up on time.

Hi. May I take your order?

I think we need a few
more minutes.

Okay.

I remember this movie,
'Night of the Comet.'

It was about how these two
women woke up and

found they were the only two
people left on earth.

I've always wished that that
would happen to me.

But then you'd be alone forever.

Never any love or companionship.

Exactly.

Hey. I didn't know you
came here too.

How was lunch?

We haven't eaten yet...uh...

This is Red.

This is George and Nancy.

Nice to meet you.

I should get running.
See you soon?

Sure.

Nice to meet you.

You too.

Good friend of yours?

Just some guy I met at
Icon last week.

Oh.

Kedric, tilt your
head to the left.

To your left, Kedric.

Good morning, Brielle.

Good morning.

Has Eli arrived yet?

Oh, I'm not sure. I
haven't seen him yet.

Alright, thank you.

Mmmm Hmmm.

You look very nice today.

Thank you.

Oh, morning Dick.

What are these?!

These are just for my portfolio.

You do not do these kinds of
things on my property.

I - I did these after hours,
Emily.

Don't you talk back to me,
Elliot!

That's a pretty ring you've got.

Thanks.

What's wrong?

They took my ball.

They took your ball?

Was it their turn to play with
it, or did they
just...they just took it?

They just took it.

You wait here, Princess, okay?

Okay.

Did you take this from
that little girl?

I asked you a question.

Why? I mean, you've got plenty
of friends to play with. I'm
sure that you can think

of something better to do
with your time.

Thank you. Maybe if you invited
her to play with you she'd be
willing to share it.

Hey- here you go, sweetie. Okay.

Hello?

Emily? Dick?

Hey - somebody had better answer

or I'm setting the
alarm when I leave.

Hello? Hey.

Right now? Okay, yeah. No,
no sure.

Okay, yeah.

I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

Okay. Bye.

I'm really sorry I
keep bitching.

It's okay.

I guess I just don't understand
why you're so upset
about everything.

I'm just tired. Ya know? I'm
tired of people. I'm
tired of society.

I'm tired of everything life
claims to offer but is
never fulfilled.

I just feel lost, you know?

I've made decisions I never
thought I'd make 10 years ago.

The people that I always thought
would be there for me
aren't anymore.

I have a mother who wants to be
a part of my life,

but I don't think I
want her in it.

Too little, too late?

I just can't let people in.

Can you let me in?

No. I can't. I just
can't right now.

Well, I can wait.

Ohhh. A lover's quarrel so soon.
Like I didn't see THAT coming?

Do I even know you?

Bitch, you should! I mean, it's
the only way you're going to
become something in this place.

I don't need to be anything in
this bar. I need to be
something out there!

Grrrl. You got your
fangs out again?

Leave the snowbirds alone.

There's some ignorant little
twinks in the back to torture.

Grrrl! I am not done with
this cheap tart yet!

Grrrl. She's not cheap.

In fact, I'm sure she's worth
more than she realizes.

Red, you take care of this one.
Mend his wings and he will soar.

Bitch, you are not Jonathan
Livingston Segall.

And you aren't young
enough to make

those Good Will
threads look trendy.

Come on, Skank.

Your broom is waiting to
take you home.

Not until I plug it in first.

Does there have to be drama
every time I come in here?

Yes!

So...can I see you again?

Maybe. I really want to. I
just need time.

That I can give you.

Damn, you're looking
especially gorgeous tonight.

Mmm Hmmm.

For as much as you're on Eli's
case about being on time...

Well I had some dirty business
I had to clean up.

White and pure - just like you.

Who are you kidding?

What? You don't like
white roses?

Let's just say I have an
issue with them.

Have you been drinking?

A couple. I needed to relax.

Bad day?

Just got me thinking about the
ex-wife got me all riled up.

Did Hillary really do
that much damage?

Who? Oh yeah.

Could we not bring that name up?

She's a pain in my ass too.

Do you have anything
else to drink?

George, I need to ask
you something

and I want you to be
completely honest with me.

Well this certainly
doesn't sound good.

Are you sure that
you're into women?

I mean, if you're honest with me
now I'll totally understand.

Who got you thinking about that?

You did, George.

I mean, we've been seeing each
other for almost a month

and you never do anything
to make me think

you enjoy being with me
in a sexual way.

What are you talking about,
Nancy?

Didn't I just give you
flowers and kiss you?

On the cheek, George,
or on the hand.

Never on the mouth.

You do the same things for
me that Corin did.

I am tired of hearing about that
fucking faggot! That little
bitch had it coming.

It's always 'Corin did this,'
or 'Corin did that.'

Well fuck him! He's
dead for a reason!

You don't know
anything about him!

I know I am not - like - him.

You want me to be a man?!

I am not - like - him!

Eli?

Eli?

Oh yeah, Daddy...

Hi.

Hi.

Can we go for a walk?

I should have been
more considerate.

No. No, Eli.

I should never have acted out
at you like that.

Especially in front of
other people.

I'm just having a very hard
time of things lately.

I sometimes hear
voices in my head.

What are they saying?

Nothing. Nothing, really.

Not to go out and kill anyone or
anything like that.

But I just...

I - sometimes I
think I hear Elliot.

Do you think it's because
of the drinking?

No...No. I drink to
stop the voices.

Well - what about therapy?

Hah! Absolutely not!

If my mother found out...?
No - no...no.

We don't do that kind of
thing in our family.

I've already lost most of
her respect anyway.

The thing is, Eli, I am only
peaceful when I am with you.

Sometimes I feel that I am
coming to think

of you as a
replacement for my son,

and I don't want that to go to
a dangerous place.

But there's something else,
something Marti just told me.

What?

The reason she left so
abruptly was...

Hi.

Mom?

I was just driving bye so I
thought I would stop.

Who's your friend here?

This is Emily. She's my boss.

Oh, you're boss.

This is my mom...Hillary.

How do you do?

You've raised a
wonderful young man.

Have I?

Can I talk to you for a minute?

What was that?!

Nothing.

What do you mean, 'Nothing.'

You're holding the woman's hand.

That's not 'Nothing!'

I'm just showing her some
support, Mother.

She really needs it right now.

Besides, this is none of your
business. Go home!

I am not leaving without you.

Don't try and act like a
mother to me now.

Grandpa took care of those
duties for you.

Well Thank You for that.

Now look - I have been through a
hell of a lot in my life,
just like you.

You keep trying to avoid me.

You keep trying to cut me out of
your life, but guess what?

One day you're going to wake up
to the realization
that you need me,

and that I will help steer your
life in a positive direction.

I don't need you.

Oh yes you do. Everybody
needs a mother.

Everybody needs a June Cleaver.
Not a Courtney Love.

So, his son says that they were
together. Is there any reason
to doubt that alibi?

No. If Eli's backing him up then
I guess it had to be
somebody else.

Is there anyone else who would
pull this kind of prank on you?

Prank?! Are you serious? Since
when is digging up a
corpse a prank?

Uh, ma'am, there was no
coffin in your pond.

Nancy?!

It's okay.

Are you alright?

No.

We're going to have three patrol
cars keeping watch

throughout the neighborhood for
the entire evening.

I could stay with you.

Okay.

Alright. You have my personal
number and if you have any

needs I can have an officer at
your door within a
matter of minutes.

Thank you, Lieutenant.

Thank you.

Are you sure you're comfortable
with me staying here?

I don't know.

But if you try anything, they'll
know you're the guy.

I need to use the little boys'
room.

Who is it?

Lieutenant Dickertson.

George!

George!

George!!!

Eli! What are you doing here?!
Come on.

I was expecting Marti for dinner
but she still hasn't
shown up yet.

I came to say goodbye.

Goodbye?

I have to leave.

Here.

No.

You can't leave.

Yes, Emily. I have to. It's
best for both of us.

No, Eli...You're the only one
who makes the pain go away.

You're...You're the only one
who stops the voices!

No. No no. I cause
the voices, Emily.

I cause the voices.

No! No no...

Before I met you, I was going
to take my own life.

Without you here, Eli, I
will...I will.

No! No! No! No!

I will - I will!!

Emily!

Oh no...No...

You're a wonderful woman...
You're wonderful!

You're wonderful...
and I love you -

but I hate you for making me
love you this much.

No. No - you're not leaving me!
No...no...

Emily...It's okay.

Oh no...

I love you.

Okay.

Elliot please!!!

Emily...Elliot is dead,
Emily - He is dead!!!

I am not him... I AM NOT HIM!!!

No...No... NO!!!

He's gone!

Well where did he go?

He didn't just get up
and walk away.

...And you have no idea
where the body is?

You walked out there with me.

I don't understand why you
won't call the cops.

Because I'm not going
to keep running.

Whoever's trying to get at me is
going to come back,

and all the police will do is
show up after the fact.

I'm going to face this asshole
head on and end it.

I'm not going to be some
dumb bitch who

waits around to get
knifed in the shower.

Can we prepare for
battle over dinner?

How can you think of food at
a time like this?

Well, he's not going to
try to kill you

in the middle of a restaurant
and I'm starving.

So either we go to the police
station or we go to get
something to eat.

Don't hang up.

I just want you to hear me out,
honey. Okay?

I need to be your mother more
than you need me to be yours.

I just really need a chance to
prove myself to you.

You know, I don't need to hear
about how young you were,

or how selfish you were,

or how many men you needed
to put before me.

That part - it's all done...
okay?

We're just going to start fresh.

You've got to let me knock
down this wall.

How are you ever going to
understand where I've been,

or why I've done the things that
I've done for the last
several years.

I know what it's like to be
fucked over by everybody
in your life -

and by everything in your life.

So I understand that.

I just want to help you
break your cycle.

I need you to stop replacing
people that love you

with these really shitty
imitations of people.

Just remember, honey.

There's never been a moment
where I haven't loved you.

Yeah.

I'll meet you at Henry &
Wanda's at 6:30.

Okay. Bye.

I'm going to get
something from the bar.

What do you want to drink?

Something strong. Johnny
Red on the rocks.

Nancy?

Oh - Hi.

I just wanted to apologize for
my entrance the other day.

That's fine.

I don't necessarily want to see
my ex-husband either.

Who?

George.

Who's George?

Your ex-husband.

I've never been married.

Eli's father.

Who's Eli?

Your son...

My son's name is Mark.

But his grandfather's
name is Eli.

His grandfather?

Yeah. He's the man who took care
of him, but... he's been
dead for years.

That's it!!!

I'll slit your throat if
you fuck with me!

Mom!

Mom! Mom!

The police are on their
way right now!

Everything was just fine until
that bitch showed up!

Nothing can ever be easy.

It was all so perfect
in California!

Fucker!!! You fucker!!!

You can fight me all you want
but you are not going to win!

Let go of me!!

I am so much stronger than you
ever thought I was,

and you gave me
complete control.

Now you deal with
the consequences!!

No!!!

It's about time you showed up
and did some work.

Come. Give daddy a big kiss...

Richard?!

So you do remember my name.

Did our son ever know it?

Eli?!

I told you to stay away.

Oh. Haven't you made an
appropriate
introduction to your boss?

Emily...meet Mark.

Hey.

Hey...

He's my whore.

Pick up a talentless starving
artist in West Hollywood,

and offer him $25,000 so he can
chase after that
bottomless dream,

and he'll turn even bigger
tricks for you than he did...

You know... I don't know.

Exactly how many fat old men
have pounded that ass
for $150 a night?

You gave it to me for
at least a year.

Fuck you!

Is it true?!

Why?

Because he told me what you
did to his son,

but I didn't think it would
end up like this!

Oh, you're right there!

If your fucking mother hadn't
stepped in and put her face
in our business.

Oh, of course, she's just a
junkie looser trying to make it
right with her queer kid.

At least I'm not living a lie.
Come on, man.

Telling everyone I'm your son,
instead of your...

well, I guess the right
word isn't lover.

Over 30 years since you left
your wife, and you're still
fucking hiding!

I HAD to run away! You don't
know what my life was like!!

I lost my family because of it!!

You ran away, Richard!

Fuck you!!!

You ran away!!!

I tried to find you and
you hid yourself.

But I did it for him...

No...no... noooooo!!!

Oh my God... How could you
do this to him?!

I'm just giving him what
he died for...

to be held in that -
man's - arms...

No...if you loved him you would
have let him rest.

If I loved him?! THIS is
all about love!

Look who deserted him when he
needed them the most!
His boss...

I'm giving you a chance to leave
on your own terms...

His friend...

His fiancee...

Why are you doing this to me?!

His fucking mother...

This is about love...

You don't know
anything about love.

Oh don't I? I brought him back
to the house he was born in.

My key still works.
Isn't that funny?

Couldn't part with the family
property, could ya?

Oh, let me guess, Emily.

You were just holding out for
the highest bidder.

That's what you always did...

waiting for the best, as long as
the best came with a big
fat - check!

Oh, that's what love has
always been to Emily.

Of course it must be so much
more painful for you,
right Mark?

At least it wasn't our mother's
who abandoned us...

Like how you abandoned Elliot?

Shut up!!! You want love? You
could've had it from me.

You didn't want it, did you?

You just wanted the paycheck
like everyone else.

Oh but you'll love 'this,'
won't you?!

Don't you just want
to squeeze him...?

And tickle him...?

And kiss him?

Leave - him - alone...

He's just so...perfect...

Did you tell him you loved him,
like you said it to me?!

You paid me.

You stop this right now,
Richard!!

Oh, you're right there, Emily.

So I guess I need to
kill everyone.

I thought I would set it up...

and make it look like you
committed suicide...

like you did the deed.

No...

It worked when I killed Jake.

He didn't want to die. But he
had the option
between him and you.

It seems he actually
cared about you.

Oh, and he even wrote his
own suicide note.

Of course, I was holding a
gun to his head.

Too bad I'm not holding up my
part of the bargain.

Make me!!

Don't you bitches get it?
Everything was a set up.

And you told us exactly what we
needed to know to get
inside your heads.

My son used to play the piano.

What? You don't like
white roses?

What I really need is someone
around here with a personality.

Stop it!

No!

Richard!!!

I'm sorry.

The cars!

What are you doing? He probably
has the keys on him.

I'm gonna beat that
mother fucker's ass.

He's gotta have
something else in here.

Go look in the other cars.

Marti, where have you been?

I had to leave... I...
I was pregnant.

Elliot has a son.

Gotcha!

Where is he?

My brother's been raising him.

Find anything?

No!

Hello?

No, she's not here.

Yes! We need the police!

Richard!

Richard!!!

Come out you coward!!!

I am tired of you running away!

FACE ME!!!!

Come on, Emily.

You've always got
something to say.

If you had told me the
truth when we met,

we wouldn't be here like this!

Enough.

Give me the knife.

No.

I'll give you double
what I offered.

Think what $50,000
could do for you!

Nothing - compared to what this
woman has done for me.

What? What - she made
you feel loved?

Is that it? Is that the magic?

You're just a soulless
little Hollywood whore.

Remember that. No emotion.

Right. I'm a whore.

But this woman has shown me more
love than you'll
ever understand.

You told me you loved me.

You paid me.

You realize neither of us is
getting out of this.

The police are on their way.

We'll help you get through this.

It's alright, Mark. He is not
going to hurt anyone else.

Thank you. For everything.

You've been ripping my insides
out ever since I first
got in your car.

Oh my... oh Mark...

Oh baby...oh baby...oh baby...

Reach in my pocket.

Give it to somebody who -
who deserves it.

I'm tired... I'm tired.

Let us go.

No...no...

Let us go.

Oh...no...no...

Returning to a story which has
reached almost
mythical proportions,

Emily Hamilton,
mother of slain...

...mother of slain gay
martyr Elliot Hamilton,

revealed today that her
son fathered...

...fathered a child with his
then fiancee, Marti White.

Marti White fled the city once
her case was thrown
out of court...

...out of court, back in
November of 2005.

She claims she hid the child's
existence from her

family and friends because of
shame for herself,

and for not wanting the child to
grow up under public scrutiny.

the child to grow up under
public scrutiny.

I don't know why I do the
things that I do...

why I hurt those around me,

when they've done nothing
particularly wrong
directly to me.

Perhaps I try to justify my
actions by thinking they
do deserve it...

...payback for everything
they've ever done to
hurt others -

consciously or not.

I think it's really because I
feel dead inside -

like I'm constantly living in
the month of November.

Cold. Lifeless. Nothing to
offer. Sometimes I think...

...sometimes I think I even
like it that way.

I once heard someone say you
should appreciate what
God gives you,

because he could take it
away at any moment,

and you'll have lost it forever.
I don't care.

The only thing He can
take is my life,

and that wouldn't be
much of a loss.

I don't even know if I
believe in Him anymore.

It is a loss.

The voices have gone now, Mark.
