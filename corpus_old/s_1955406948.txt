Alright,
on my count, go, go, go.

Clear.

Watch that corner.

Hands, let me see your hands.

Got you...

Stuck up.

Hey, move it, gringo.

Hey, John.
Hola, chica.

Do you guys need anything?

Nope, we'll be fine,
thanks, we're cool.

You hear that song?

In terms of the latest
narco quarter

that we're interested in,
that was set up by El Mini Oso.

<i>Now, interestingly enough,</i>

<i>it's been taken over</i>
<i>by Felix Camarena.</i>

Oso was an ex-cop who at the
time of Camarena's first arrest

ran the Puento Grande
Mexican prison.

Oso made sure to help set up
Camarena's first prison break.

I'm not sure who helped him
the second time around really.

But Camarena did
return the favor.

In February, my team
raided his compound.

<i>As you may, or may not,</i>
<i>know when we got in there</i>

<i>we encountered severe resistance,
got into a big gun fight.</i>

<i>I ended up killing El Mini Oso.</i>

<i>We had 200 million dollars</i>
<i>in cash, some Euros,</i>

<i>over 100 big exotic cats,
200 firearms, most of them FA,</i>

and 150 tons of cocaine.

I ended that motherfucker.
That's why I'm here, John.

You killed the bear.

I don't need to tell you
about your reputation

on both sides of the law.

The cartels know that you're
someone to be reckoned with

and the FBI and ICE
know that as a purported agent

of the DEA, you're also
in bed with the CIA.

Do you need to get that?

Fuck no.

Look, I'm here,
off the books, because I need to

reactivate a cold asset.

My brother, if I get back in,
there's 1,000 motherfuckers

that are gonna die,
good guys and bad guys,

and I'm gonna end up
being the bad guy,

and I don't want that.

In the past several weeks
ICE has been picking up

more and more OTM's along
Sonora smuggling routes.

<i>ICE runs across</i>
<i>them all the time.</i>

<i>Mexicans being smuggled
in all the time.</i>

<i>Nuh-uh, not like this.</i>

<i>Two days ago ICE picked up two
OTM's along the Texas border.</i>

This close to making it across.

But your Native American friends
working the routes that night

<i>noticed something</i>
<i>different about these two.</i>

<i>Let me guess,</i>
<i>you got a hit on an OTM.</i>

Two hits. Two known
Islamic extremists, John.

Two of the three main players
responsible for blowing

Crimea A-450 out of the
sky over Syria last year.

As you know the CIA in concert
with the DEA and the FBI

have been after these animals.

Each belong to
different groups though.

Split between Al-Nusra Front
and Hezbollah.

So you're talking high level,
high value targets.

Wow.
I'm interested, tell me more.

DOJ has reasons to
believe that these guys

are attempting to form
an unholy alliance

with the narco terrorists
along our borders.

Same cartels that create
men like El Mini Oso.

Now the agreement
is simple in theory.

Their caliphate will supply
the cartels if the cartels

use their smuggling routes
to sneak terrorist cells

into the US undetected.

The FBI doesn't want it
and the CIA can't do anything

about it once they
land on US soil.

And that leaves the DEA.

And that brings you to me.

You're the best
wet mechanic out there, John,

and a very unique asset,
straddling both worlds,

the CIA and the DEA.

Okay, so, I'm gonna
need something actionable.

There is a meeting taking place
marking the marriage

between these groups,
making it official.

Where is the
meeting taking place?

Neutral ground.

But the exact location,
we don't know.

Stay and drink with us, baby.

Don't be shy.

Okay, so here's the deal.

If I'm coming in to do this,
I need resources.

I want to pick my own team,
I want my own equipment,

my own gear, and I'll need a jet
to tote me and my team around.

So I guess you're back.

My account info,
same as usual.

And I want to talk
to the OTM tonight.

Now if you'll excuse me.

Just stay, relax.

Hey, Maria, Maria.
Hi, papi.

How's my baby.
Who's this guy?

How's my baby girl?
Not that good.

Not that good,
what's happening?

Because of them.
Really?

Hey, who the fuck are you?

Do you guys know
this is my baby?

You're baby?

But you know what,
it seems to me...

Seems that what?

Is this your beer?
Yeah.

Hey,<i>ese.</i>

He took your beer, man.

It seems to me that
you're bothering her.

Stay down, bitch.

I was never here.
You understand that right?

<i>Hello.</i>

<i>Zara, it's me.</i>

<i>John, wow,
it's been a long time.</i>

<i>How's Mexico or wherever</i>
<i>you're living these days?</i>

<i>I'm coming back home,</i>
<i>good old USA.</i>

<i>I need your help for something.</i>

Alright let's try an easy one.
Where are you from?

Okay, I see you
recognize the word.

So, probably you didn't
count on me grabbing you.

And because you were trained
to sit tight and not say

a word, then you'll probably
be kicked loose by dawn

because that's where our current

administration
makes all of us act.

You didn't count on my Native
American brothers grabbing you,

<i>and I'm sure they</i>
<i>took one look at you</i>

<i>and saw you a mile away.</i>

You're an Arab.

You're no Mexican.

Your clothes ill-fitting.

Eh, you look kind of
Yemeni with a neck scarf.

But your friend
from the other room,

he's not from there is he?

Of course you do,
he's already rolled on you.

How do you think
I know you're Yemeni. You know?

He tells me that the Al-Qaeda
and the Arabian peninsula

are very active.

But you guys aren't
usually found hanging out

with the Al-Nusra Front.

AQAP working with Daish, yeah?

This tells me that you
and your pal aren't really

trial running anything
to set up smuggling routes.

This tells me
you're forward negotiators

setting the stage for something
big that's about to happen.

I do not speak English.

Man that's some funny shit.

I also know who caught
the eye of the border agents

when they nabbed you guys.

See, Native Americans
are experts at tracking

and...
and the thing of it is

you weren't sneaking in
from Mexico to the US.

<i>You were sneaking out of</i>
<i>the US into Mexico.</i>

<i>You were already here.</i>

So tell me your name,

tell me the name
of your contact in Mexico

and finally tell me exactly

where the real meeting
is taking place and when.

My name is Abdulah Al-Hamdani.

Our contact in Mexico is the
head of the Sonora drug cartel.

<i>He wanted to show us his</i>
<i>southern border operations.</i>

<i>So you were kind of</i>
<i>inspecting the routes, right?</i>

<i>For the corridors?</i>

<i>We were making
an alliance of convenience.</i>

<i>Yeah, I understand that.</i>

Mexico isn't really interesting
enough without AQAP and Daish.

We have enough
desert back home.

Yes, you do,
and that's why I know

you're still lying to me.

You're here for an
easier way into the US.

Something with less eyes on it.

<i>With more sand.</i>

<i>Something further away,
but still a hub, a port,</i>

<i>with a history of trafficking</i>
<i>as well as religion.</i>

Your contact in Mexico
was Jose Rivera.

But that's not where the
meeting is taking place.

How do you know his name?

Rivera's the head
of Sonora cartel.

And if you're making a deal with
any cartel, it's with Sonora.

<i>You want the access to</i>
<i>their extensive rain time,</i>

<i>subterranean land</i>
<i>and air smuggling route.</i>

And you like the fact
that they're brutal.

Rivera's expanding into Turkey.

How could you
possibly know that?

'Cause I've been in Mexico
for a long time working Rivera.

He hasn't been in Mexico,
he's been in Turkey.

And he's been taking out
all the heroin godfathers

<i>one by one by one.</i>

<i>You see a storm's coming.</i>

So other than a switch from
the Agency to the Bureau,

you haven't changed a bit
since last time I saw you.

I could say the same
thing about you, John.

Still wearing the Rolex.

Yeah, it's platinum. I got this
from finest girl I ever had.

Yeah, from me.
Yeah, it was you.

How you been?
I'm alright. You know me.

Yeah, I know you.

So, you really
think this meeting

is taking place in
Istanbul and not Mexico?

I mean, I never
really believe intel.

You believe intel,
we used to say,

and that's the key
to death, you know.

You can never trust intel.
But that's what they say.

Okay.
I'll write it up and pass it

on over to our old CIA contacts.

Baby, that's not
why I asked you to come.

I was thinking I might get
you to come back on my team.

Oh, I figured...

You've been reactivated.

We need one more person to
complete our three-man team.

Better if somebody's
kind of internal,

maybe with Agency connections,
not really DEA or FBI.

What do you propose we do?
This three-man team of yours.

You know we find folks,
we interview 'em.

If we like 'em we give
'em a box of chocolates.

If we don't, we kill 'em.

And then?
And then...

I will do my thing.

I thought those
days were behind us.

Naw, man, our best days
are ahead of us, girl.

I need a good SIGN guy
who can provide me with

minute-by-minute intel
and some real time images.

These days
you're talking drones.

So what do you need me for?

I need you by my
side to watch my six

and do what you do best.

<i>His name's Matthew Sharp.</i>

<i>SIGN all the way,</i>

<i>but five years of HUMINT</i>
<i>training before that.</i>

<i>How long with the Agency?</i>

<i>- Fifteen years.</i>
<i>- Before that?</i>

<i>Army, Special Forces.</i>

<i>Doesn't have much else</i>
<i>in his jacket about that.</i>

<i>Yeah, probably wouldn't.</i>

Am I meeting this guy?
He's late.

He picked the time
and the place.

Yeah.

Uh, John, that thing's
coming in pretty low.

I think it's locked
on to your truck.

Shit, he's locked on to my car.

John.

Let him go.
But it's carrying an AR.

John.
Let him go.

Okay, that got my attention.

John.

John.

You must be Sharp?

You must be John Harmon.

Yeah, I'm Harmon,
but I'm still waiting

for the answer to my question.

Yeah, Matthew Sharp.

That's some pretty nice
piloting you did out there.

I might have a job for you.

So Rivera's group has
moved into Puerto Rico

to try to grab the heroin trade.

Drugs come in to the states
through smuggling corridors

in Arizona, Texas,
and California.

They're shipped to New Mexico

then trucked to the
eastern seaboard.

At the FBI, we have a saying
that applies to Puerto Rico.

No customs, no problem.

See that's what it's about.

I mean they have a situation now where
it's kind of very distinct, you know.

'Cause US territory means that any
shipments departing the United States

are not
required to clear customs.

So shipping the drugs
to the eastern seaboard

from Puerto Rico
is easier than using

the established
smuggling cartel routes

and trucking the
stuff across country.

And now that Rivera's
controlling it,

he's trying to set
up a new situation.

He's trying to set
up a new supply.

And I think that's what
this meeting's about.

The company's well
aware of the ambitions

of Rivera and others like him.

But until it leaves our borders
it's DEA and FBI territory.

Intel has really shown us
unequivocally and absolutely

that Rivera is joining forces

with the
Islamic fundamentalists.

And there's where
he'll get new supply,

new man power, new routes.

Al-Mujahid is gonna get
them all their quarters

which gives them new access...

...to bring anybody and anything

they want into the US,
and that's scary.

Istanbul.

If it's good
enough for the heroin trade,

it's good enough for Rivera.

We all know that
devout believers,

real believers of all faiths,

have nothing to do with the rise
in violence across the world,

but that doesn't mean that we
shouldn't do anything to stop it.

In my book, it makes it
our duty to stop it.

That's right. We don't give a fuck
about anybody's fucking religion.

We don't care about what their
ethnicity is, we don't care.

We let everybody
do what they want.

It's like the great
Genghis Khan once said,

"Practice your own religion,
but pay tax to me."

It's like a monkey trying
to fuck a football now, really.

This whole thing,
it's just a fucking mess.

Anyway, my intel is
telling me right now that

Rivera's supposedly
holding a summit.

Supposed to be a big meeting
within the next 48 hours.

It's my job to stop
that meeting from happening.

First, we need a car.

Let's see.

Looks like I found
the perfect one.

<i>Rivera collects
vintage American cars.</i>

<i>How's a canary yellow</i>
<i>Camaro sound to you?</i>

It's a little small
but it'll stand out.

Sharp, you in position?

In position.

Rivera's pulling up now.

Is our other party close?

Not yet.

Good, I'm getting into position,
Zara's heading inside now.

Zara, you copy?

Go, Harmon.

<i>What's your 20?</i>

At the elevators,
eighth floor.

Stay put I'm coming
in the side door.

Sharp, I need you to look into
target room on the eighth floor.

I'm on it.

Come on, where are you?

<i>Sharp?</i>

Still looking.

Who the fuck are you?

Sharp, you're killing me.

Gotcha.

Harmon, room 826.

Zara, get me clearance
on the other side.

Good afternoon, ma'am.
How can I help?

Could you connect me
to room 825?

Of course, ma'am. May I have
the name of your guest please?

O'Sullivan.
O'Sullivan.

825.
825, 825...

I'm very sorry ma'am
but this room is vacant.

Can I have the name
of your party again?

O'Sullivan.

Let me just check and make
sure I have the right room.

It will help,
thank you very much.

825.

<i>Vacant, it's all yours, Harmon.</i>

<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Sharp are we covered?</i>

Like white on rice.

825.

<i>I got my eyes on you, Harmon.</i>
<i>All good.</i>

No answer, I'll have
to check back in a few.

Sorry for the bother.
No problem.

No, no.

My friend... just you and me.

You should go. It's enough.

I'll go with you.

You two watch the lobby
and you two make sure

that Mr. Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.

Let's go.

Harmon, you got company.
Sending you an image now.

Alright, stand by.

<i>They are on their way up now.</i>

<i>It's enough.</i>
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

Ayan Al-Mujahid.
Former number two man, Hezbollah,

in charge of the bomb makers.

Fully assumed control back
in September

after the US drone strike
took out his brother.

His whereabouts is,
at the moment, unknown.

<i>Looks like we just found him.</i>
<i>Gate four.</i>

At last, no more middlemen.

I trust the plane
was satisfactory, right?

I see you already
met my assistants.

Belicio, Augustine.

Why are they here?

I told you,
they are my assistants.

<i>They are nothing but killers.</i>

<i>Yes, and they happen to be
very good at what they do.</i>

<i>Do you have problem with that?</i>

Sure, no problem, hefe.

What the fuck is that?

What is what?

Is that a camera?

Ayan, we aren't in the desert.

<i>This is a five star hotel</i>
<i>on some of the most expensive</i>

<i>stretch of land in Istanbul.</i>

Something is not right here.

Ayan.

Ayan.

You don't think that I,
that I'm surveilling you

without your knowledge here?

I think you're acting maybe
a little paranoid, my friend.

Rivera, it's not paranoia
if they are really after you.

And I'm not your friend.

I am, however, used to
things not going to plan.

People dying because
of what I believe

needs to be done for my cause.

The merging of your
organization and ours

is beneficial to both
of us in many ways.

However, just because I need
your help, it doesn't mean

I don't think of you as
nothing more than an infidel

that I'd rather see dead
and buried in the sand.

This should cover
the plane you sent.

I'm heading back to the Palace Hotel
to check on the package.

The meeting will take place
as previously discussed.

At your compound
by the Rumeli Feneri.

If any other suspicious
events will occur between

now and then,
I can assure you of two things.

One, the meeting
will not take place.

And two, the last face
that you'll see before

you are buried in the sand
will be mine, smiling.

Mujahid is now on
his way to the lobby.

They bought it.
Nice flying, Sharp.

Time to get
the fuck out of here.

Just go down to the lobby
and make sure

nothing suspicious
happens while you do.

Get someone out and ask who's
flying that fucking drone.

Zara, give me
coordinates on my secure site

and an accurate schematic,
if you can.

Soon as you log the
time for the meeting.

<i>Copy that.</i>

<i>Sharp, I'm gonna
beat Al-Mujahid.</i>

<i>Meet me back at the safe house.</i>

Copy that.

What's Rivera's
Camaro doing here?

The drone.

There, come on.

Shit.

Harmon, I've been made.

I got two players
at the elevators.

There's a third
in the elevator with him.

Good to know
they're out numbered.

<i>He's heading to his car.</i>

Yeah, I know.

It's his car, alright.

I'm calling Rivera.
Yeah, okay.

Did you take this car?

Looks like time for phase two.

Harmon, Rivera's on the move.

<i>Follow him.</i>

<i>But if he suspects you,
back off and then go.</i>

We're just setting a hook,
not scaring him.

Copy that.

I'll keep peaking him
'til you do.

Then I'll get gone.

One hundred Euro.

There's one just like it
if you follow that black car.

And a third if you forget
you ever picked me up.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I'm on my lunch break, so...
That's what I like to hear.

Tell me, have any
of you noticed the tail?

Since the hotel.

Lose him, lose him now.

Game on.

<i>They finally picked me up.</i>

<i>How are you doing with Rivera?</i>

He hasn't spotted me yet.
We're heading east.

I'm thinking Zariyash district.

<i>That's a good bet.</i>

I'm gonna turn up
the heat a little bit.

You back off and meet me at
the safe house in 30 minutes.

Copy that, out.

Okay, lunch break's over.

New destination,
Zariyash district.

I'll tell you where to go
when we get closer.

Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

The tail is turning around.
In the cab?

Si.

Must be the Arabs.

I'm not sure what kind of game
Ayan is trying to play with me.

Put the Turkish team
from the hotel on the cab.

And no more fuck ups this time.
Understand?

Claro.
Good.

<i>Analyzing voice patterns.</i>

<i>It's not paranoia
if they are really after you.</i>

<i>Synthesizing voice for Al-Mujahid.</i>

Ayan.
-<i>Rivera.</i>

I warned you about doing
anything suspicious, didn't I?

<i>Ayan, I don't have</i>
<i>the slightest idea</i>

what you're talking about

and why you call me
on an unsecure line.

Do you own a yellow Camaro?
You know I do.

Please tell me why it's
following me at this moment.

Who has my car?

What?
Who has my car?

It's at the compound. Why?

Because this guy
is telling me in this moment

that my car is following him.

It's impossible.

Ayan, I have no idea who
is following you in my car.

<i>I warned you</i>
<i>that anymore bullshit</i>

and I call off the meeting.

Are you telling me?

Yeah, I swear.

Harmon, go.

<i>The safe house, boss.</i>

Good, Zara's right behind you.
I'll be there in 10.

<i>They take the bait?</i>

What do you think?

<i>Harmon, speak to me.</i>

We're gonna need
to get rid of the car.

Harmon, go.

<i>It's Beck.</i>

Of all the people for
Rivera to be partnering with,

Ayan Al-Mujahid is one of
the most dangerous, Beck.

<i>That's why</i>
<i>he's CIA territory.</i>

<i>That's all I can say.</i>

And you would know?

<i>Yes, even though I'm</i>
<i>not CIA I think I would know.</i>

But there's another objective
because there usually is.

<i>As I already told you,</i>
<i>I'm not CIA,</i>

<i>so I wouldn't know.</i>

And as I am also not
working for the Agency,

I'm just a reactivated asset,
maybe you could tell me why.

<i>Why?</i>

Because we would be searching
all over Mexico

to find this location if it
wasn't for you and your team.

So why did you reactivate me?

Because you
killed the bear, John.

<i>And now I need you</i>
<i>to kill someone else.</i>

Al-Mujahid and Jose Rivera
are gonna seal this fucking deal

tomorrow night unless I act
on this intel right away.

<i>What do you
have to say about that?</i>

I've got a delta team en route

to handle that
very problem for you.

<i>Like you said, Hawk,
we don't need you or your team</i>

<i>to end up being the villain</i>
<i>if this thing goes south.</i>

You did what you needed to do,
pinpoint and locate the meeting.

<i>Now it's time to do</i>
<i>what you do best, alone.</i>

You know if I
remember correctly, Beck,

you came to me hat in hand.

You begged me to help.

Look, I'm here,
off the books,

because I need to
reactivate a cold asset.

I had my reservations,
but I agreed.

All I asked was at the time
you be straight with me.

And somehow,
in the back of my mind,

I'm getting this strange
little voice telling me,

they're not being
straight with you.

And I don't think you are.

<i>And I was, John.
Just think about it.</i>

The money,
the resources, the team.

Now I'm tasking you
with another objective.

<i>Comes from the top.</i>

<i>You're the CIA's</i>
<i>best wet mechanic,</i>

<i>and you're already in country.</i>

That was no accident, okay.

Who is the target?

Is the real target Al-Mujahid?

<i>No.</i>

<i>Is the target in that room?</i>

Yes.

Do you want
my team to stand down?

<i>Yes.</i>

So you want me to act alone.
<i>- Yes.</i>

Who is the target?
Abdul Rauf.

<i>You know the name, John.</i>

<i>The third
Crimea Airlines bomber.</i>

<i>The one who actually made the</i>
<i>bomb that took down the plane</i>

<i>with 238 innocent</i>
<i>people on board.</i>

<i>Welcome to Crimea flight A-450.</i>

<i>Please step out of the aisle
while stowing the carry on baggage</i>

<i>allowing other</i>
<i>passengers to pass.</i>

<i>He's a bad one, John.</i>

<i>CIA trained.</i>

<i>He's about to activate
cells in the US.</i>

<i>He's the package.</i>

The one being
smuggled in by Rivera.

<i>This alliance</i>
<i>is all so Al-Mujahid</i>

<i>can get Rauf into the US.</i>

<i>So have your team</i>
<i>pack up their gear.</i>

<i>I'll set up</i>
<i>an exit route for you</i>

<i>on USS Mount Whitney</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

Their mission is over.

<i>Get it done John and come home.</i>

So that's it?

Well, as far as he's concerned,
for you two, that's it.

As far as I'm concerned,
it's not it.

You don't think I had anything
to do with this, do you?

I don't know, man.

I think that if you're
asking me if you had anything

to do with Beck
pulling us from the job

one minute after he
received enough information

to pass it on up the food chain,
I would say no.

Okay, thanks.

That was my office,
there's nothing I can do.

Beck really thinks it's
a good idea to pull us out

before we finish the job?

He does have
other operational plans.

You're staying on.

I am.

You have a new objective.

I'm not gonna listen
to any of his shit.

I'll make him think I am,
but I'm not.

We're gonna stay on
and we will kick ass together.

Nothing's gonna change,
we'll finish what we started.

You hear?
And how do we do that?

Like this.
You're gonna love this.

What are you guys cooking up?

See, we already have
all the leg work done.

We've got the location,
the time of the meet,

and the players.

And that's really
all Beck cares about.

What we also did was
create a situation where

we've pitted these guys
against each other.

They suspect each other,
that's gonna fuck up the meeting,

and pretty soon they're
gonna wanna kill each other.

Cy ops.

Well, that's kinda how we do.

<i>Anyway, we've just succeeded</i>

<i>in burning these bitches</i>
<i>to the ground,</i>

<i>'cause Rivera can't figure out
why his Arab partners</i>

<i>decided to wage a secret war
against him at this critical junction.</i>

<i>He doesn't know
that they haven't, and we have.</i>

So you're altering
his official file.

Beck's gonna know
that's been dummied up.

It's not for Beck.

<i>This is for Rivera.</i>

<i>So you're setting up</i>
<i>Al-Mujahid with Rivera.</i>

What about the other way around?

<i>Al-Mujahid's the
mastermind behind all of this.</i>

<i>Without his desire for</i>
<i>this meeting to take place,</i>

<i>Rivera would be content
running the drug trade.</i>

There's no doubt that Al-Mujahid knows
the value of this access into the US.

So much so that he's
willing to put up with all

the perceived indignities
to make it happen.

And his threat to pull out
is just that, threats.

Because he has resident
cells placed inside the US,

what does he need
to activate them?

Transient cells,
someone smuggled in.

He'd give anything for that.
And for that, he needs Rivera.

Rivera's compound.

Anyway, the location of the
meeting's in 24 hours, guys.

This is the alarm system
command and control.

Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.

<i>Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.</i>

What'd you just do?

Shut off the alarm system.

How does that affect Al-Mujahid?

Who turned off the alarm,
and why?

Ayan. It's become
all too regular for you

to be calling me like this.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

Do you know that you threatened
to march, you piece of shit.

Or maybe I just
call your bluff, hmm.

I'm a businessman,
I do business.

You said that you want
to call off the meeting.

<i>Fine, call the meeting, fine.</i>

<i>But my humor has a limit.</i>

<i>And then I become</i>
<i>a real asshole.</i>

And when I'm a real asshole,

I sometimes forget about
my business agreements.

Understand me?

<i>You mean to tell me
that you have had nothing to do</i>

<i>with the drone surveillance?</i>

What the fuck is that?

What is what?
Is that a camera?

The attempt on my life
in your flashy yellow car?

And now the very suspicious
disarming of your alarm system

right before our meeting
at your compound.

Do not think for one moment
that I don't know my value for the CIA.

You forget my only reason
for making this agreement.

Rauf.

Must be that all your
good humor is used up.

<i>Is that it?</i>

<i>So being the businessman</i>
<i>that you are,</i>

do not think that
I'm foolish enough

not to see a double cross
when one present itself.

You are more paranoid
than Pablo Escobar ever was.

<i>I suggest you rethink your</i>
<i>priorities and call me back.</i>

I will give you 30 minutes.

Ayan, please believe
this 30 minutes

are the most important 30 minutes
of your entire existence.

You know,
this could get back to us.

In my opinion if this works,

they're gonna pat us on the
back and take all the credit.

If it doesn't, they'll swoop in

with the D-boys
and kill everybody.

Either way we will have
finished the job we started.

I'm gonna pack up my gear,

and I'll meet you at the
extraction point in two hours.

It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

I mean, you're the one
looking like that.

It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

I thought I closed those.

John?

Get the other one.

How long?

Forty-five minutes.
Rivera or Al-Mujahid?

Rivera.
So she's in the compound.

What's the play?

I'm going to get
my partner back.

I'll get the van.

Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

She's awake.

No, she's not.

Zara's cell phone.

What? You sure?

<i>...Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.</i>

Come on, get in,
I'll fill you in on the drive.

I missed it.
Missed what?

It was right under my
nose and I missed it.

I'm not following you.

This entire
meeting was a set up.

And it was a set up to get us
looking in the wrong direction.

Beck tasked us with putting
together a team to locate

and disrupt a meeting between
Daish and the cartels.

But mysteriously they
won't let us finish it.

Why?

Because he's a paid
and bought bureaucrat?

Because he thought
the real target would be there.

Take a look at this.

<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

I know that name.
Yeah, we all do.

<i>Abdul Rauf was
trained by the Agency.</i>

<i>But that was before he
and his buddies blew up</i>

the commercial airliner
that killed about 238 people.

In Mujahid's file he was
in charge of the bomb makers

before his brother
was killed and he took over

the command and control, so...

If he's carrying a
suitcase nuke or a dirty bomb

he could decimate
a US city in seconds.

See, Beck wants me to take
him out before he gets there,

but his intel is bad.

He's sending in the D-boys
to the wrong location,

which means
we have no more time.

It means you and I are gonna
have to get there and do this.

Alright.
So where are we headed?

<i>I'll go with him.</i>
<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

Palace Hotel.

Ayan, what the fuck?
Where is Rauf?

I was about you to ask
you the same thing Rivera.

Is this how you Mexicans
do all your deals?

What the fuck is this?

If my understanding
of English is any good,

I will say that the man
pictured where your picture

is supposed to be, doesn't
look a thing like Ayan Mujahid.

And to add insult to injury,

it says there
that you're supposed to be dead.

So, again, where is Rauf?

I see what is going on here.
You see?

Please, enlighten me because
what I thought is gonna be on

was a meeting
to seal our alliances.

To create few rules.
We have a saying.

Please.

The man who speaks,
does not plan.

The man who plans,
does not speak.

It means I don't think
you are behind this.

It looks like CIA to me.

And this is supposed
to make me feel better. How?

You aren't smart enough
to be working for the CIA.

For the last time,
where is Rauf?

We have been compromised,
our business is finished.

Ayan.

I want to show you something.

We're here to smuggle Mr. Rauf
into the United States, no?

So time to make the deal.

Is this a joke?

You're right, there seems to be
a third party in our midst.

Harmon, eyes are up.
What's your 20?

Entering now.

<i>We're moving out
now. Begin sweeping the grounds</i>

<i>and meet us
in the conference room.</i>

Copy that.

Who the fuck are you?

<i>Gotcha.</i>
<i>Third floor. Wait.</i>

<i>They're moving Rauf out now.</i>

<i>Land your bird
and get in here and back me up.</i>

Going upstairs.

Copy that.

Hey, wait.

Who are you?

It looks like someone decided
to cancel our arrangement.

What do you mean? Her?

She's just a fucking woman.
Enough.

Benicio, untie her and give
her something to drink.

We'll see if she's
more than just a woman.

Boss, come with me, now.

Rivera!

<i>...moving in.</i>

Come on, boss, we have
to get you out of here.

Let's go.
I want Rauf.

If I have Rauf,
I have all the leverage

to get out of this mess.

Uh-uh, come on.

<i>Copy that.
Team two closing the perimeter.</i>

Come on.

Compound is clear.
No sign of Rivera.

Copy. You hear that, Harmon?

D-boys are clearing the compound.
No sign of Rivera or Zara.

Yeah, Sharp,
I've located the target.

<i>Ground floor conference room,</i>
<i>near the back.</i>

Two guards posted.
Two guards.

<i>I've located</i>
<i>the main power box.</i>

<i>On my count.</i>

Three, two, one.

<i>Rivera got through,</i>
<i>repeat Rivera on the run.</i>

Mr. Rauf.

Do you know why I'm here?

Do you know why you're here?

I'm here because
the CIA hates it

when they train somebody

who takes what they've given
them and makes a lot of money

to finance
terrorist activities.

Is that what they told you?

Yeah, they told me that
and I read a few reports.

But what if I told you that
I was ordered to do what I did?

That I know all about
the CIA's deep dark secrets

from Tripoli to Syria
and everything in between.

You know too much.

I'd say that's
why I'm a target.

I commend you for
telling the truth.

I just can't let you come into America
and activate these cells.

You actually think that this is
a war of religious differences?

It's much bigger than
differences in ideologies.

I got it. I understand warriors
fighting for their cause,

for their countries,
for their religion,

whatever they believe in,
their ideology.

But I draw the line when it comes to
killing innocent women and children.

This is where we really, really

have a big
difference of opinion.

Okay.

Rivera got through,
he's got Zara.

Then he's coming here.

You go that way.

Come with me. Move.

Fuck you, puta.

Let's go home.

We're done here, Sharp.
