â™ª ooh â™ª

â™ª in my soul â™ª

â™ª he's a wonder â™ª

â™ª in my soul â™ª

Yes, he, yes, he is.

â™ª - Bless his name. â™ª
Sing it, baby.

â™ª I want to bless his name. â™ª

Bless his name.

Curtis. He...
Baby... w-where's my toolkit?

Where the...
Where it should be.

It's supposed to be right here.
No, it's not.

Yeah, I left it in the kitchen.

Curtis, where in the kitchen?

On the table.
Right.

And is it supposed to
be on the table, baby?

Don't do that.

What... what am I doing?

Talking to me like I'm a child.

Well, Curtis...
Don't do that.

Leaving your little toys around
on the table is like a child.

They're not toys. They're tools.

And this is my work, bitch.

What'd you s...

This your work what?

My workbench.

Curtis, this is my kitchen table,

not your work table.
You don't know what the hell it is.

So, you did move it.

Well, Curtis, it shouldn't
have been right here.

Where'd you put it?
Where does it belong?

It belongs wherever the
hell I put it, woman.

Now, this is my house, Ella.

Okay, "my house... okay, my house."

Well, that's your garage out there, too.

So, you put it in the garage?
Why'd you put it in the garage?

Curtis, that's where tools go, tool.

Well, you need to go get it.

Curtis, do you know how
heavy that stuff was?

Why would I go get it and
bring it back in here?

How did you move it?

Me and the kids moved it.

Then "me and the kids" mean

"you need to go get it and
bring it back in here."

Baby, please, just go... go to
the garage, honey, just go.

Baby, you the one that put 'em in there.

Curtis, listen to me...

I am not playing with you.

Rrr!

Baby, I got to fix this stuff.

I got to fix this stuff

so I can open up the laundromat in...

tomorrow, whenever I'm opening it up.

Curtis.
What?

I have heard this for months.

That's 'cause it's true, baby.

You need to hire somebody, baby.

With what, Ella, my...

my amazing looks and
my gorgeous physique?

Curtis, baby, just go to the bank,

try to get a loan.

Ella, I didn't move
down here to do a loan.

I'm not doing a loan.

Didn't your pastor say,
"no loan, no debt" this year?

No debt... I'm not doing debt.

Well, if you're not doing any debt,

then we won't be opening this year.

Why can't you believe in me?

Curtis... because I know you.

You know what?

Curtis, when have you
fixed anything ever?

Are you serious right now?

I-I fix stuff all the time, Ella.

C-Curtis, all the time
we were in Atlanta,

you never... you never fixed nothing.

I fixed the stove.

And it never worked again.

I fix... I fixed...

Nothing, baby, nothing... nothing.

You fixed nothing.

I fixed you when I... [MUTTERS]

You really don't think
I can do this, do you?

Go on and say it.

Did you see that? I can't be...

I can't believe you asked me that.

No, baby, I don't.
No, I don't. Look at this.

Look... what...
What kind of tools are these?

Okay. All right.

Baby.
No.

I'll show you, though.
Trust that... I'll show you.

Okay. Well, show me, baby...

Show me by going right on out there

to that garage with those tools, tool.

Curtis...
You know what, woman?

Cur... Curtis, don't do this.

I don't believe you.

Rrr!

A mess.

And then she gonna go
talk about... talk ab...

She don't even believe I can do it.

She's right.

No, she is not.
Uncle C.,

you been in this place all this time,

and it still looks the same
as it did when you got here.

No, it doesn't.

This place looks so much better.

By whose standards?

By mine.

I keep telling you you're
not gonna pass inspection.

Ryan, I know the inspector.

You don't know anyone.
You just moved here.

I wish I didn't know you.

That can be arranged.

Boy, please.

Look, uh, get over here and
help me move this thing.

Man, why don't you just hire someone,

like normal managers?

Oh, my goodness, you sound like Ella.

She's a smart woman.

Excuse me?

You've been working on this
same dryer for a month,

and it still won't get hot.

It's because you won't
do what I tell you to do.

You can't put a space heater
at the bottom of a dryer.

Why not?

Code. Code!

Code schmode.

Okay.

You're never gonna get
this place open in time.

You don't know nothing about no code.
Yes, I do.

Then why didn't you fix
all this stuff then?

You know so much...

Why you ain't fix it, Mr. Code?

Look, uncle Robert showed some things

when I was running this
place but not everything.

Some things required skilled labor.

Have you seen the estimates?
Yes.

All these people were doing
were trying to rip me off.

You got to get these things done.

Not all of 'em...

Especially that one on top right there.

Pfft. Don't need that.

That one? Didn't need that one, neither.

Yes, you do. These are life safety.

You see that?
That's a life safety violation.

Which means people die. On your watch.

You think you so smart.
I am.

Then you need to go to school.

I would have if I could afford it.

Instead I'm stuck here with you.

That is so dramatic.

So get to work and hush, okay?

Can you do that?

Get to work and hush.

Life safety. Please.

This a... life safety...
T-this place is safe.

Oh, you really think so?

Name one thing that's
not safe in this place.

You.

Name another one.

Exhibit "A"... fire alarms.

You don't have any.

So what happens if there's a fire?

Then I yell "fire!"


"Fire!" and I run.

But not too far.

Jesus, take the wheel.

This place will open,

and it will be a wonderful place.
I can see it now...

"Wash your Payne away laundromat."

You heard me.

You sure you want to go with that name?

"Payne" is my name, son.

Oh, and it fits.

You know what? You're a hater.

You a hater, and I'm
gonna figure it out.

And you gonna see...

When I'm rolling in the dough,
you gonna see.

I'm telling you, they're not
gonna let you open this place.

I'm not trying to please them people.

Well, these violations
surely ain't gonna please them people.

I know what I'm gonna do.
What?

I'm gonna call my boy Tango and get low.

They're gonna come down here
and get this place right.

Ya heard me?

That don't even sound right.

No, no, no. These boys are good.

This cast is good, man.
They'll come down here,

I'll put 'em up for a couple
of days at the house.

They'll come from Atlanta,

and they'll have this place right,
I'm telling you.

And how's aunt Ella
gonna feel about that?

Who?
Your wife.

I'm the man of the house.

Yeah, that right there
gonna get you killed.

Mm-hmm. "Murder, she wrote."

Boy, please. Be quiet. Hush, please.

Okay.

Get low!

Your boy, Curtis.


Is that English?

Hey, hey, man, I need you

to come on down to Florida, man.

Ah, ye... Yeah, you know
we moved out here, boy.

Warrant? Can't leave the state?

I know, I know. Probation.

Man, what kind of friends do you have?

Hey, what about Tango, man? Where Tango?

Tango [MUTTERING] too?

Oh, man, they just taking
players out, Jack,

since I got out the game, ain't they?

Y'all need me to watch y'all back.

There's... hey, look here, man.

Hey, no, I can't do it, doc.
I'm done, I'm done.

No, I ain't coming back, man.
I can't do that.

I'm through with that life.

Okay. Well, thanks anyway, man.

Hey, get out soon, Jack.

Hey, and look here,
make sure y'all come down here.

All right.

Sound like the chain
gang all chained up.

Stop listening to my phone calls.

Yeah, I think that's the feds.

Get out of here.

Okay. My pleasure.

Good luck.

Chain Gang.

Hey, man, hey.

Hey, God.

Hey, man, you know me...
Ella's boy, you know.

Do it right or don't do it at all!

All right, I'm...

Get out!
All right.

Lord, you got to help
me get this place open.

So, how are things going
with her and the kids?

They are adjusting.
Mm.

You know you a Saint for
letting them move in here.

Well, we're used to it.
Mm, that's good.

How's she doing down at the church?

She doing well.

Good, good, good, good, good.

But... but, Ella...
What?

I just saw her with Kendrick.

Are you kidding?
Mnh-mnh. He was just there.

I hope she's not getting back with him.

I don't know what she doing, but I'm...

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

What were they doing?
Well...

Okay, Joann, did you see them talking?

N-no, no, I didn't.

Well, then maybe it's nothing.
I sure hope so.

Okay, good. Me, too. What time is it?

Oh. It's almost lunchtime.

Okay. Call Ryan.

Well, he said he call me.

Grr. Okay.

Ella.
Mm?

You sure you really want to do this now?

I told you... I have got to get

a good contractor in there.

Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

And Terrance is good.
Good.

Yeah, I need him in there

or else Curtis is gonna ruin it.

And I can believe that.

What's that?

This is a workbench.

What'd you say?

That's what's Curtis
said to me this morning.

"This my work bitch." I
said, "what?" He...

This is his work station.

On the kitchen table?
Right.

I told him, "get this
stuff off my table."

You know what? You Ar...

[CELLPHONE RINGS]
Ooh, ooh-ooh.

Hello?

Tello.

Has he gone to lunch?

He said he's leaving for the day.

Oh, good. He said he's gone for the day.

Gone for the day.

Hey. Why?

Said he hurt his hand.

Is he all right?
He's all right.

This place is wearing him
down a little bit, though.

Oh, I bet it is.

Terrance is outside, so he's coming in.

Oh, okay. Well... well, we're
gonna come right on over.

<i>- Okay.</i>
Okay. Wait, wait, wait!

Call me and let me know
if Curtis comes back.

He won't.
He won't?

How do you know that?
Is he... is he hurt bad?

No, just his bald ego.

Okay. All right, bye-bye.

Come on. Let's go.

Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry.

[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

Yo-hoo! Hoodie-hoo.
Hello!

Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

Alright.

Hey, where's Terrance?
Over here.

Oh, hi.
Hey.

Hello, hello.

Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much for coming.

Oh, no problem.
Oh.

So?
So what?

So, what'd you think?

Well...

Yeah, yeah.

Well, how bad is it? Tell me. Tell me.

Well, all the electric is
gonna need to be replaced.

Will it?
Yeah.

And all the fire systems
need to be updated.

Updated, well, ehh.
That sounds expensive.

It is.

Okay, how expensive?

We're talking in the neighborhood

of $20,000 to $40,000.

$20,000 to $40,000?


That much?
Yeah.

Well, we don't have that much
money laying around, baby.

Oh, no?
Uh, no. We don't.

Miss Ella, are you sure about that?

Listen, I just look like this.

We don't have that much
money laying around, baby.

They broke.

Well, there sure is a lot
of money back there.

What you talking 'bout?

It... That money back
there behind that drawer.

Okay, go get it. Show me what
you talking 'bout, baby,

there's a whole lot of money.

In there?

There's a whole lot of money in there?

Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

No, no, no. These... okay.

Oh, hey! Oh, my god!

Crazy! That's where I had left it.

Well, what you talking 'bout?

No, no.

Hey! Yeah, god. Oh, yes, he did it.

Oh, my Benjamins.

Is that uncle Robert's money?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
How much do you think this is?

I have no idea,

but I know it's enough to
cover all these repairs.

Look at God. Look at God.

Where we looking at him at? Where he at?

This is the blessing that we need!

No, no, no, no, no, no, he won't.

Ah!
This is my mama's money.

[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

Child, what you talking 'bout?

Uncle Robert left her this laundromat.

And she sold it to us.

Bu-but that's...
Listen, baby, the Bible says...

Don't you put that Bible on me.

Le boy, Le boy, Le boy.

"The wealth of the wicked

will be laid up for the feet..."

Hey, nuh-uh. Come on.

No, no, no. That's our money.
Your mama's money?

Child, your mama don't even
know this money is here.

Oh, she will after I tell...
What?

What happened to the Christian
woman I was just talking to?

She's still here.
She's still here right here,

defending her money.

Your mama don't even
know this money is here.

This money right here belongs to us.

Go on and call her.
I will.

Call your mammy.

Miss Ella, do you think that's fair?

Do you think it's fair for your mama

to sell us this piece of rat trap

and make it look like a...?

Baby.

So, she embellished a little.

No, your mama lied is what she did.

No.
You know she lied.

It did make $8,000... at one time.

Well, this right here

is gonna help us make it again.

So you not gonna give her anything?

Well, you know what? Okay.

We'll just count it and
see how much it is, okay?

Got it.
And then, wait. Unh-unh.

And then we will...

And then we will decide
on what we gonna do after that.

I think I should keep my...
No, no. Come on.

You just want to get popped, don't you?

No. You just wan... come on.
Put your hand in here.

No, ma'am.
Come on, soldier!

With your fatigues. Put it in there!

This isn't right, aunt Ella.

Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't tell her that we have it.

I'm sorry, aunt Ella,
but I gotta tell my mama.

Okay. Fine.

You go on and tell your mama.

Go on and tell your mama.
You can tell your daddy.

You can tell your grease,
grease grandmammy.

But ain't none of 'em coming
here to mess with our money.

It's wrong, aunt Ella.

I thought... oh.
Hey, it's me.

I thought you...
It's me.

Well, back up.

What you doing back there
anyway looking around?

Miss Ella, you do know money

can be the root to a lot of evil.

Ah, learn your scriptures, baby.

1 Timothy 6 and 10, the love of money.

And I love this money!

Ha!

The wonder!

I'm glad I don't have to be
the one to deal with all this.

I'm glad you the one that
gonna get all this, too.

Well, it'll be fine. It's gonna be fine.

It's gonna be fine.

And wait till your husband finds out.

Oh, no, no, no. I'm not
telling Curtis about this.

Oh, no.
Why not?

No, I'm not telling c...

No, I'm not telling Curtis about this.

This will drive Curtis crazy.

Trying to hold on to money is,

like Curtis trying to
hold onto a honey bun.

Oh, you know what he really loves?
Pork chops.

No, really. You wanna see it gone?

Put one in front of him. That's my baby.

But this money will be gone as fast

as that pork chop will be gone.

So, miss Ella, you gonna keep
all this money to yourself?

Yes.

Ooh. Ooh.

â™ª He's a wonder â™ª

â™ª oh, in my soul. â™ª

Listen, baby.

Listen, baby, if you don't mind,

would you escort me and my baby

to the bank?

Gladly.
Ooh!

Don't come this way,
she's scared of people.

I got you, baby. I got you. Mwah, mwah.

I got you, baby. I love you, too.

I love you, mama.

This baby named Benji. Thank you.

â™ª He's a wonder. â™ª
