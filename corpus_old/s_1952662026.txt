That's a dead end.

Come on, Shrek, who needs a map,
when you got animal instinct.

Damn bugs! Stupid...

Come on here!
Shrek, a little help here!

What are you...
I say we take 10-th in 305

and get off at the Fairy-tale Falls.
What are you talking about?

Or we can fly!

Is there an off button on you?

What's wrong, princess?

You shouldn't be this unhappy
until years into the marriage.

It's the happiest day of my life!

Let me guess.
You're overwhelmed by love.

No!

I mean, yes...

But that's not why...
A shrimp part was bad?

No, Donkey!

Wait, wait!
I got it! I got it!

You always wanted a puppy,
but all you got was tosters!

No!

I'm sitting in an onion!

This carriage is one big onion.

Why didn't you say so?
I'll turn on the air.

Much better.

Noble steed at your survice!

Would you look at that.

Donkey, I found a shortcut.

Are you crazy?

That's a big one.

I hate spiders!

Stop that!

Where did it go?

You are too easy to scare.
Come on.

That forest could be anything!

I ain't going in there!

Listen, I'm an ogre.

I'm the one that does the scaring.

What's there to be scared of?

That!

Telonious?

Hey, what are you doing?

I'm sorry, princess.
Honey moon is over.

Let go!

Fiona!

Shrek!

Fiona!

Let me go!

To the carriage!

Shrek!

We got a donkey driving a carriage
made from an onion.

It's dark and our horses
are wearing sunglasses.

Cut to the chase, Donkey!

Just cut to the chase!
Hit it, boys!

Fiona!

Shrek!

Watch out!

This 3-D is pretty cool.
Donkey!

I saw it in another dimension.

Oh, for the love of Pete!

I'll poke your eyes out!

Help!

All done.

No, no, no!

No!

That was close.

That's sweet!

Shrek!

Watch out!

Hey, Shrek!

I hope you're insured!

That house cost me a lot of do...

Is there a doctor in the house?

Sorry about that, Gingy!

That's gross.

Oh, no!

I can see! I can see!

Never mind.

Fiona!

Shrek, this isn't another one
of those shortcuts, is it?

Just get a move on!

Okay. I'm not afraid.

Fiona!

I can do this.

I'm a noble steed.

It's all right. It's just a park
with no children and no playground.

Shrek!

I feel dead people!

Are you getting the willies, the trembles,
the shakes, the heebie-jeebies...

Stop messing with me, Shrek!
This place is already creeping me out.

Don't tell me you are
afraid of ghosts.

I'm not afraid.

What a crack up.

Shrek!

Shrek, wait up!

Talk about rewriting history.

Well, looks like Farquaad is still trying
to compensate for something.

I wander what that could be.

I don't know.
This is just playing freaky.

I wander if he is behind all this.

That's just crazy talk.

Now I'm seeing things!

Can we get out of here? Please!

Sure! Of course!

You wouldn't happen to have another
carriage in your pocket, would you?

Donkeys don't have pockets.

But some of us have wings.

Wrong dragon!

Wrong whistle!

Farquaad?

What have you done with my wife?

Your wife?

Don't you mean your widow?

I know I seeing you die
in the first movie!

Fools!

This time is your turn to be antre.

Okay, my sweet, take care of them.

Bon apeti!

Will you stop that?!

Shut it!

You can go first.
I'll be the dessert.

Oh, great!
That's my girl!

Hey, baby,
I was hoping you'd show up!

Princess at 3 o'clock!

Shrek!

Hi, princess!
Fiona!

Oh, no! Shrek!

Oops! Sorry.

Coming in!

Dive! Dive!
Got it. Dive! Dive!

This is Red Dragon.
We're going in.

Defensive action!

Lack and load!

Stay on target!
Stay on target! Stay on target!

Fire'em out!

On my mark, retract wings!

Now!

Smooth move, Exlax!
Like I always say:

Behind every successful donkey
there's a fire-breathing dragon!

You might as well
stop struggling princess.

Soon you and I will be together forever.

With you as my spirit queen,

I'll be king of the underworld!

Over my dead body!

Exactly.

Over she goes, Telonious!

Telonious?

Sorry, princess.

No! Nitwit!
Not with you on it!

What?

I deserved that.

And that too.

Sorry, Telonious.
Never mind him.

See you on the other side,
princess!

Never!

Stop playing hard to get.

Stop it!
You know I'm irresistible.

Fiona!
Shrek!

Impossible!

I thought they were dragon food!

We'll save you!

Are you okay?

I think so.

I don't think so!

On, no!

Splendid!

They all fall for me
sooner or later.

Fiona!

Yes, Shrek?!

My short life is flashing
before my eyes!

I love You!
I love you too!

Fiona, my ghostly queen,
where are you?

Right over here, sweety.

My angel!

Oh, no! Not again!

We've got a loaded dragon here...
...and we're not afraid to use it!

It was just a joke!

Stay away!
Fire!

No!

Thanks, Dragon.

And thank you, Donkey.
You truly are a noble steed.

Look at you, Donkey, all covered with fur!
I love you!

Shucks!
I think I'm gonna cry.

Come on, baby.
Let's go home.

Let's go home and make some waffles!

Have I told you lately
that I love you?

Waffles?

It's a long story.

Finally we're alone.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Let the honey moon begins!
