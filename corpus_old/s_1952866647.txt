        I like this one.        

Hey, dad.                       

Did you know                    
that breakfast                  

Is the most important meal      
          of the day?           

        Of course it is,        
            sweetie.            

         <i>Honey, I don't think</i>   
   <i>any more bears are gonna fit.</i>

You're gonna rip the bag.       

          They'll fit.          

    I don't think so.           

 <i>(Lilly)</i>                        
 <i>well, breakfast only works</i>     

    If you actually sit down    
          and eat it.           

            Oh.                 
 <i>(mom)</i>                          
 <i>okay.</i>                          

 <i>That's it.</i>                     

             Okay.              

                           <i>(dad)</i>
                           <i>good.</i>

                    I got it.   
                        Good.   

                             Oh.

         Hey, good one.         

        Owen, don't eat         
      those wild berries.       

             <i>You don't even know</i>
             <i>if they're safe.</i>   

    They're safe, mom.          

      The madman left them      
            for me.             

    Here we go again.           

         Bigfoot lives.         

        Owen, let's just pretend
                    for a moment

          Your madman           
    of the mountain is real.    

     Is he mad, like angry,     

                   <i>Or is he mad,</i>
                 <i>like cuckoo?</i>   

             <i>(Owen)</i>             
          <i>I don't know.</i>         

     I'll ask him next time     
        I see him.              

Well, if you ask me,            

        The only madman         
 of the mountain is you, Owen.  

Believe whatever you want.      

          Okay, honey.          

    Can you get those           
          down there?           

                        Yeah.

          It's only a Teddy bear

I know.                         

It's for your mother,

    This is my semi-automatic

              Wow.              

    It needs a little work.     

    What have you got here?

That is cool.                   

Aw, showtime.                   

Right, here.                    

             Okay.              

        Good luck               
    at the convention, mom.     

                  Thanks, honey.

         Okay, while we're gone,
              Lilly's in charge.

  Yeah, I'm your baby-sitter.   

You're still man

          I love you.           

    Okay, we'll call later.     

    Okay.                       

        Bye, mom.

  But it makes me feel better   
        to see it there.

          Around who?           

                    Meagan Todd.

    I deliver a paper

             Stay away from her,
                     understand?

                  Whoa.         

         Did I say you could go?

             Yeah.

          No, Dexter!

don't.

                dangerous parts.

Well, what's to tell?           

I mean, I didn't                
pull the job.                   

All I did was                   
pick up the package.            

We're just

How do you think                
Mr. Inside                      

Got me and the jewels           
past security?                  

The dog                         
is the package.                 

                            Ahh.
                Cool.           

          Hey, so when          
        do we get paid?         

Just as soon                    
as we make the delivery.

there till midnight.            

What happens at midnight?       

You turn into a pumpkin.

Screwy, what are                
you talking about?              

Someone will pick up            
the package.                    

                         Who?   

I don't know,                   
and I don't care.               

      Well, how they gonna      
    know that it's us?          

Because we're the ones          
with the dog, you dummy.

All right, here.                

        Give me the bag.        

    You take the dog,           
        all right?              

        And don't               
     let nobody touch her.      

                      Hey, boss!

          We made the headlines.

      Don't show me that.       

        All right?

this is the men's room.         

    Here's the women's room.    

          [grumbling]           

                    What a sweet
             young tyke you are.

                      [grunting]

                      Bless you.

      He likes the stick.       

Look at that.                   

        Hey, stop, stop!        

         Don't do that.         

      You're hurting her.       

     Better stay back, kid.     

        This dog bites.         

 <i>(Arty)</i>                         
 <i>yeah, real bad.</i>                

            [growls]            

                 She's starving!

      When's the last time      
    you gave her any water?     

          [blubbering]          

          [guffawing]           

I did not think of water.       

Come on.                        

Hey, doggie,                    
you like the stick?             

      You like the stick?       

      Look out, look out!

              Hey!              

     Whoa, tough guy, huh?      

      [dog lapping loudly]      

                    This harness

        Don't let her escape.

                 As a rule, um--

            I don't like

      Don't worry, mister,      
         I'll find her.         

I know these woods

                Yeah, you'll get
             the back of my hand

             Sorry, boss, sorry.

      What is that thing?       

    It's a scarecrow.           

I built it for the madman       

     To protect his garden      
        from the birds.         

        Ah, you're              
         a clever kid.          

          But you don't scare me
      with that madman nonsense.

He's leadin' us                 
everywhere that dog ain't.      

That's exactly                  
what I was thinking.

    with yellow lines           

    So I would never forget.    

     Stay away from them...     

  And never touch their nuts.

      Oh, and check this.       

         Way down there         
          is my house.          

            Come on.            

     I'll show you around.      

Shh!                            

    What is it, boss?           

I thought                       
I heard water.                  

A creek                         

Would lead us                   
out of this jungle.             

                          How do
                  you know that?

Because I was                   
a cub scout,                    

And just before                 
they kicked me out,             

I learned that                  
if you follow water,            

It'll lead to people.           

        [laughing]              

          That's dumb.          

         How can water          
     know where people are?     

Turn around!                    

         Oh--oh, boss.          

                No.             
                             No.

I said turn around.             

        [yelling]               

        [snapping]              

              Hey.              

          [squeaking]           

            [laughs]            

              See?              

  I've got everything I need.   

    Now I've got you.           

    [melancholy music]          

              (music)               

You would've liked shadow.      

         You could have         
    been best friends.          

    But now that she's gone,    

        Mom won't let me        
        get another dog,        

        'cause my sister        
      has dumb allergies.       

 <i>But that's okay.</i>               

    You can live here.          

          [dog barks]           

              Him?              

     He's the best inventor     
        that ever lived,        

    Leonardo da Vinci.          

  And these are my drawings of  
some of his amazing inventions. 

            And this            
is my tennis ball cannon.       

I don't get many visitors,      

         And when I do,         

 It's usually just Dexter Clopp 
    and his gang of losers.     

 That's why I built this thing, 

      To keep Dexter away.      

        No, girl.               

    This is home to someone     
    you don't want to meet.     

         Just stay away         
      from this box, okay?      

 You sure have a fancy collar.  

 <i>These can't be real.</i>           

 <i>No tag.</i>                        

        No owner.               

            No name.            

  I'm gonna call you Diamond.   

          [dog growls]          

    What is it, girl?           

      <i>Don't worry, Diamond.</i>     

        We're safe here.        

 <i>Those men</i>                      
 <i>will never find us.</i>            

      They don't even know      
         where to look.         

        [gasping]               

Water.                          

I need water.

The kid's bike.                 

         Owen "p," huh?         

Now we got a name               
for the little devil.           

                    Aw, dang.   

        Address is all worn off.

Eh, small town.                 

How many boys                   
named Owen can there be?        

Boys and dogs                   
go together                     

Like peanut butter              
and jelly.                      

Find the boy,                   

We'll find the dog.             

Let's go hunt.                  

          Ooh, I want that bell.

    [electricity crackling]     

        [both screaming]        

            That kid's a menace.

 <i>The madman built that.</i>         

    It's kind of like           
          his mailbox.          

I bring him old newspapers      

         So he'll know          
 what's going on in the world.  

    I heard he was a monster    

 Who used to work at a circus.  

    People paid to see him.     

         Then one day,          
 he ran away to these woods...  

          To be free.           

         Come on, girl.         

    Time to head back           
          to the fort.          

      [dog lapping water]       

             Okay.              

        If anyone comes,        
      head for the woods.       

  You got to stay here, okay?   

                      [whimpers]

         No, if I don't         
    make it home for lunch,     

      My sister will freak      
      and call my parents.      

        I've got to go.         

        [whimpers]              

        Stay here, okay?        

         I'll be back.          

        I promise.              

                    There.      

No!                             
                 Oh.            

        There he isn't.         

        [laughing]              

             Sorry.             

Hey, kids.                      

Come here;                      
come here.                      

He's about this tall.           

              Nah,              
    I don't know him.

     <i>who are you talking to?</i>    

No, it's just someone           
for Owen.                       

           <i>Oh, my God,</i>

 <i>(Arty)</i>                         
 <i>snakes.</i>                        

See, boss, nothing              
to worry about.                 

Diamonds                        
are in good hands.              

            Yeah, but they're   
                not in my hands.

                  Luckily we got
                 plenty of time.

                  Wait a minute.

            Kid's got to eat,   
                          right?

Yeah, right, boss.              

She said he'll                  
be up there until dinner.       

        And when he comes back--

     [together]                 
    we grab him.                

                          Ah.   
        Ooh, yeah.              

Oh, hello, Owen.                

What can                        
we help you with?               

             This.              

Oh, the Diamond heist           
down in L.A.                    

What about it?                  

    I know who did it.          

                 <i>I've got proof,</i>

          Right here.           

The dog did it?                 

      No, she's innocent.       

    See, the thieves needed     
someplace to hide the diamonds, 

        So they--               

                       <i>So they--</i>

         [insistently]          
        so they--               

  So they hid them on Diamond!  

Hid what?                       

    The diamonds on Diamond.    

                 On who?        

 <i>On Diamond, my dog.</i>            

    I mean, their dog.          

        I mean...               

    She was their dog,          
     but now she's my dog,      

          Because I--           

    Owen, we don't have time    
    for stories today.          

        But it's not a story.   

But it sounds like a story      
    like your madman story.     

        But there really        
is a madman in the woods.       

He escaped from a circus.       

And now he's best friends       
      with Bigfoot, right?      

             <i>Why are you smiling</i>

        When the thieves        
are right here in Cheney?       

We hear you,                    

And we are gonna                
keep an eye on 'em,             

Won't we?                       

                 Well, don't you
                want to even see

                    The diamonds
                  on her collar?

      Owen, do me a favor.      

    Just deliver the paper;     
        stop reading it.        

                        Come on.

 <i>(Owen)</i>                         
 <i>hey, Meagan.</i>                   

              Hey.              

          Who's this?           

Oh, my new dog,                 
Diamond.                        

             Cool name, Diamond.

                  Can I pet her?

Sure, I'll carry that.          

                Diamond...      

             Shake.             

                    Wow, did you
                 teach her that?

No, she's just                  
real smart.                     

                  Pretty collar.

Yeah, I know,                   
she had it on when I found her. 

                      Found her?

Yeah, abandoned                 
in the woods.                   

                    Who would   
         do something like that?

Diamond thieves.                

                         Who?   

Diamond thieves.                

It was in the paper             
about these three crooks        

Who stole these diamonds.       

And one was a nun               
who really wasn't a nun.        

She--I mean, he used Diamond    
to smuggle the diamonds         

Out of L.A. To here,            

And that's why                  
I helped Diamond get away.      

That's when                     
she became mine.                

        So you mean the diamonds
         on her collar are real?

Yes, and they're                
worth like $5 million.          

The police chief                
didn't believe me either.       

          I want to, Owen, but--

        Have you ever thought   
        about being a writer?   

                Because you have
        a wonderful imagination.

          Yeah, Owen.           

            Just imagine what   
        I'm gonna do to you now.

                    Hey, Meagan.

What do you want,               
Dexter?                         

            Didn't I warn you   
      to stay away from my girl?

                    Didn't I?   

I will never be your girl,      
Dexter Clopp.                   

You're such a monkey butt.      

             What'd you call me?

A monkey butt.                  

     What are you gonna do,     
      Dexter, hit a girl?       

                        Yeah.

             Ooh, and the pooch.

  it's not safe here anymore.   

Ooh!

          [whimpering]          

    What is it, girl?           

      Looks like no one's       
         gonna help us.         

     It's just you and me.      

The first thing we've got to do 
    is hide these diamonds.     

         Then we've got         
    to get the fort ready...    

         Just in case.          

 Come on, we've got work to do.

          Don't worry;

He hasn't bothered me yet.      

          [chittering]          

          No, Diamond,

          What's that?          

    How'd this happen?          

        As soon as we're        
sure those guys are gone,       

I'm taking you to the vet.      

         Get some rest.

            Diamond.            

        Wow, the madman.        

He gave me these porcupine      
 quills for my apple turnover.  

    He must be lonely           
 living up here all by himself. 

He sure likes you, though.      

 And I guess you like him too.  

    Come on, Diamond.           

            Oh, no!             

 I'm gonna be late for dinner.  

 <i>If my mom calls</i>                
 <i>and I'm not home,</i>              

    She'll ground me.           

        Okay, stay here.        

  If anyone comes, hide, okay?  

        [phone ringing]         

             Hello?             

         Oh, hey, mom.          

        [shrieks]

         Oh, yeah, mom;         
        he's here.              

      Oh, in the backyard       
  looking for bugs, something.  

    Yeah, just a sec.           

                Here, Tarzan,   
                it's your mommy.

Hi, mom.                        

Hey, hands off.                 

No, not you, mom.               

         Mom, if a dog,         
    a really nice dog,          

    A super cool dog,           

A dog that never barked or shed 

  Or scratched the furniture,   
        or chased cars--        

    If a dog like that          
      followed me home...       

        Could I--               

        But, mom!               

    It's not my fault           
        she's allergic.         

 What if I kept it in my room?  

        Okay, mom.              

         I understand.          

    Lilly's more important.     

              Bye.              

          <i>I can't help it, Owen.</i>

I was born with allergies.      

     <i>Let me guess, you've fallen</i>
 <i>out of love with my cooking,</i>   

        And now you need        
to get back to your fort.       

So tell me about the dog.       

        What dog?               

  What are you talking about?   

                I know, Owen,   
                all about it.   

        The owners came         
     looking for it today.      

    Who?                        

             What?              

             When?              

 Yeah, these three dirty guys.  

        Oh, and I think         
    that the mean one           

    Was a little upset          
that you borrowed his dog.      

     What'd you tell them?      

                      The truth:
      That you were at the fort.

      You didn't tell them      
     where it was, did you?     

         Of course not.         

            [sighs]             

            Are you in some kind
                     of trouble?

        [knock on door]         

     <i>Well, what if it's them?</i>   

         <i>What do I tell them?</i>   

    Tell them I moved.          

 <i>Yeah,</i>                          

    I moved away to school.     

          <i>Now, that's brilliant.</i>

      Yeah, you lived here      
         this morning,          

    But now you moved?          

     Don't open it, Lilly.      

Maybe you should just give them 
        their dog back.         

You guys                        
are early.                      

                    You're still
        on baby-sitting duty?   

                [both scoff]    

                       <i>Oh, look,</i>

                         There's
                the baby now.   

 <i>[laughter]</i>                     

        Get it in gear,         
             girl.              

               <i>Boys are waiting.</i>

So you're going out?            

             Look, don't give me
        a hard time about it.   

     <i>You keep your mouth shut</i>   

                      About this
                 to mom and dad,

And I'll keep quiet about you   
hiding that dog at your fort.   

          Okay, deal.           

                  Oh, what'd you
                    name him?   

          It's a her,           
    and I named her Diamond.    

             It's a pretty name.

            Hey, don't forget   
            to lock the door.   

come on.

                She was hurt,

Let her go, and I'll tell you   
    where I hid the diamonds.

Okay.

    a flood.                    

         Go tie her up.         

        That's where I hid them:
                    In the boat.

This collar is nothing more     
than a cheap trinket

      three dangerous criminals.

         He also saved          
      this animal's life.       

If I hadn't                     
removed these
