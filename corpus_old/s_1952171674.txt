I wanna die!
Please!

Please!
I wanna die!

Who's suffering now,
Callisto?

And you thought
you were getting oblivion.

Well, this place makes Tartarus look like
a day at the beach.

How long ya in for?
Eternity?

That's gotta smart.

Get over it!

I'm doomed to be obsessed
for eternity...

...with a woman who despises me.

What a nightmare!

No kidding.

You'd think... after
what I told him...

...about you,
that you would give me more respect.

Him?

You mean "Him"...

He's come to trust me.

I have his ear from time to time.

I told him your... desire.

You mean,
he's gonna let me go back...

Well, he shares with you
an interest in Xena.

She's someone he thought
he had in his grasp...

...but now he's not
so sure.

You mean to tell me those stupid,
maudlin missions she goes on...

...are gonna end her up in Paradise?

Probably not Paradise.

Most likely, she'll be born...
higher up the karmic ladder.

Right, she cooks my family,
destroys my life...

...and I end up in Hell
while she gets another shot.

That's fair.

Gotta love the irony.

You tell him... if he wants her here,
I'm the woman for that job.

You must not harm her physically...
in any way.

Your victory must be a spiritual one.

She's found a road
to redemption...

...The way of the warrior.

You'll need to get her off
that path.

And you have to agree
to take care of one other thing for him.

Yes?
What's that?

You know the man
they call... Caesar?

That Xena can really
mess up a dream, can't she?

Who are you?
How do you know about my dreams?

I know everything about your life, Caesar.

...What it's been and what it can be.

I'm here to help you get
everything you've ever desired.

It's through me
you finally fulfill your destiny.

I can give you ultimate power...

...and free you from your greatest torment.

Xena...

Yes... Xena.

I can't tell you how much
we have in common in that way.

Let me guess...
This Eli guy,...

...he's the one that taught you all this
"love your enemy" stuff?

That's right.

Xena, why do we have to go see
a preacher?

...When there are battles to fight,
butts to kick?

'Cause whatever Gabrielle wants,
Gabrielle gets.

Excuse me. When's the next ship
for Athens?

What'd you do that for?
I had him.

Right.

What do you want with me?

Caesar's reward.

Six million dinars.

-Six million dinars?
-That's quite a temptation...

...Not for me,
for every killer in Europe.

So, it's come to this.

Caesar wants me out of the way so bad...

...he's willing to deplete
his fortune to do it.

I think it's time I put an end
to this feud between Caesar and me.

You're not gonna try to make peace
with that slime, are you?

No.

I'm going to kill him.

<i>In the time of ancient gods,...</i>

<i>...warlords...</i>

<i>...and kings...</i>

<i>...a land in turmoil
cried out for a hero.</i>

<i>She was Xena.</i>

<i>A mighty princess...</i>

<i>...forged in the heat of battle.</i>

<i>The power...</i>

<i>The passion...</i>

<i>The danger...</i>

<i>Her courage will change the world.</i>

XENA, THE WARRIOR PRINCESS

Xena...

Xena, you can't just
walk into Rome and kill Caesar.

It's an opportunity
to kill a lot of romans.

I say we do it.

We're not doing anything.
I'm going to Rome, not you.

Gabrielle, I can't take you,
not after that vision.

What vision?

I had a vision once that...

...Gabrielle and I would die
at the hands of romans.

It's bad enough that we can run
into romans anywhere...

-...but if you and I were to go to Rome...
-Ok.

Well, what if I ask you
not to do this?

Gabrielle, he's an evil man,
and he's trying to kill me.

I have to take him out
or die trying.

It's the way of the warrior.

Was I in this vision?

-No.
-Then I should go with you.

Amarice, you're staying here
with Gabrielle.

As her bodyguard?

As her friend.

You could learn something
if you listened to her once in a while.

You promise you won't follow me?

I promise.

Xena... Be careful.

There's Xena's head.

Kill him.

-Move it!
-Take "Xena" with you.

Please, no!

I did as you said.

So far, I've had eight impostors
try to claim the reward.

Xena will defeat any mercen'ry
who attacks her.

Of course.

The reward was just
to get her attention.

She will come to you.

You need to be ready.

Yes. Well, I've made plans for that,
of course.

Really? Well...

I suggest you just have
one more card to play.

It's him. It's Eli.

Your heart is pure, Mazin.

Abba...

Make Mazin's body
as whole as his spirit.

Rise, Mazin.

It's done.

You're healed.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Now, go.
Good luck.

Go.

Go.

Gabrielle...

Eli...

I'm so happy to see you...

I heard you were teaching in Greece.
I set out to find you.

Where's Xena?

She... has some work to do.

This is my friend, Amarice.

Hello, Amarice.

If somebody threatened your mother,
would you fight to defend her?

Amarice and I
have some philosophical differences.

I see.
We've got a lot to talk about.

Come on.

Can you teach me to heal?

All I can do
is try and teach you how to love.

But if you love
with all your heart and soul...

...If you become love itself...

...then you can heal.

Why is love the key?

Selfless, pure love,...

...is the only expression
of divine perfection we have in this world.

It's the greatest power
one can possess.

Oh, come on...

The only real power's
at the end of a sword.

Did you hear that?

What?

Boots.

And if the other side
has more swords?

If you can love your way out
of this one, be my guest.

-Brutus...
-Hello, Gabrielle.

You're doing Caesar's bidding again?

Caesar believes Xena is trying to kill him.
He has to protect himself.

With me.

I understand.

Let these people go.

My orders are
to arrest you, Eli and his followers.

You'll be taken as hostages...

...against Xena killing Caesar.

Caesar's promised me
no one will be hurt.

And you believe him...

Our friends are at war,
Gabrielle.

I'm sorry this brings us into conflict,
but it's inevitable.

Of course it is.

Move.

Let's go!

Come on.

-Who the...?
-At ease.

Let's make this short and sweet.

Brings back memories,
doesn't it, Xena?

Guards!

-This way!
-Look behind every...!

My, that was a shocker now,
wasn't it?

Don't bother. You've already done
all the damage you can to me.

Thanks, by the way.

For what?

I wanted to cease existing
and you did your best to help.

But as you can see, it didn't take.

They wouldn't let me off the hook
that easy.

Who's "they"?

I don't know.
Whoever it is that does the final judging.

They sent me to a place
that makes Tartarus look like...

...the Elysian Fields.
They call it Hell.

Couldn't have happened
to a nicer gal.

The one who runs things down,
where I come from,...

...he's very interested
in what happens in this life.

He figures Caesar
will be very valuable to him.

And, of course, he also figures
you might be an obstacle.

Then he figures right.
And I won't be the only one.

Plenty of people will oppose
Caesar becoming emperor.

Ah, you know
about the emperor thing...

The laurel wreath kind 'a gave it away.

I'm guessing that he'll anounce it...

...when the Senate reconvenes
on the Ides of March.

My, aren't you the clever girl?

Yes, some people will be unhappy...

...but everybody has their price.

Even the honorable Brutus.

Caesar's gonna give him Gaul
and that should keep him smiling.

But it's you, my darling...

It's you that I'm worried about.

I'm here to make you
an offer.

Forget it.

-Afraid you'll be tempted?
-Yeah, that's right.

I'll give you a little hint.

Gabrielle's in roman hands
as we speak.

-You lie.
-Do I?

My lord gave me a thorough briefing
as to what's happened...

...to you and Gabrielle
since the last time we met.

I know everything about India and Eli.

So you're not the only clever girl now,
Xena, are you?

Gabrielle's on her way to a roman prison
in the Appenines as we speak.

So...

About my offer...

Get lost.

Oh, but I'm not going anywhere,
Xena.

Come on!
Move it!

Move it! Go!

Keep moving!

Jailer, these prisoners
are to be held here.

Yes, we've been waiting for them.

Those crosses...
Who are they for?

We're expecting a boatload
of pirates any day.

No!

Don't harm Gabrielle!

Of course not!
I'm still useful to you, Brutus!

Get up.

Not until you pardon her
for what she just did.

She attacked one of my men.

And I remember a time
when mercy was shown to you!

Put down your swords.

Chain her to the prop.

Oh, please...
Can't you just break my legs?

Come on, you.
Move it!

Get in there.

Nice move.

You know, if I had a little backup
maybe I could have pulled it off.

You don't really think those crosses
are for a boatload of pirates, do you?

Caesar's never lied to me.

There's a first time for everything.

Hello, Brutus.

I have a deal for you.

You tell me where my friend,
Gabrielle, is,...

...and I will give you some information
that will save your stinkin' life.

Deal?

Tell you what...

You promise to tell me
and I will go first.

Do I have you your word?

And you trust me?

Everyone says that Brutus
is an honorable man.

Do I have your word?

Yeah.

Beware the Ides of March,
Brutus.

Why the Ides of March?

Because on that day,
Caesar will declare himself emperor.

I don't believe you.
Why would he do that?

Greed...

Lust for power...
An ego the size of the Aegean.

Of course, he plans to rid himself
of anyone who would stand in his way.

What are you saying?

He's too smart
to kill you in Rome.

You have much too much support there.

But I have firsthand knowledge...

...that he's been talking
to assassins in Gaul.

So...

Your turn.

Come on, Brutus.

Gabrielle saved your life once.

Give me a chance to save hers.

I put her in a prison compound
at the foot of Mt. Amaro.

I don't believe what you said
about Caesar.

It's your funeral.

Brutus...

Was it snowing on Mt. Amaro?

Yes, it was snowing when I left.

I did it.

Did what?

You two are sitting there
like a couple of bumps on a log.

-What could you have done?
-She did nothing.

That's right, I did nothing.

We're gonna be nailed to crosses
tomorrow morning...

...and you two are bragging about
doing nothing?

You don't understand, Amarice.

In order to become
a perfect vessel for love...

...one has to cease all activity.

Not only physical, but mental as well.

It's only when you've reached
that state of emptiness...

...that you're ready, at last,
to be filled with love.

Just in time, too.

You'll be able to love the people
who crucify us...

I just keep coming back.

In that way, I'm more dependable
than your chakram.

My lord sees everything, Xena,...

...and you don't have
to go through with this.

I can arrange it for you and Gabrielle
and all her peaceful little friends...

...to just walk out of here
and no one gets hurt.

And you and Gabrielle can live
happily ever after.

What's the catch?

Well, there is one little thing.

You have to drop your sword...

...and join Gabrielle
in fulfilling a life of loving kindness.

I'm still not interested.

That's because
you haven't heard it all, yet.

I'm offering you complete serenity.

Go on.

There's a reason you can't allow you
and your partner peace.

It's your guilt.

It motivates everything you do.

Torments you.

Invite me into your soul...

...and I can purge you of that guilt.

I can cleanse you of that shame
that drives you.

I can give you peace if you let me.

What's it gonna be, Xena?

Serenity and happiness?

Or another ride in that wagon
with your friend Gabrielle?

Think of your vision.

You're trying to tempt me
from my way by offering me peace.

In a nutshell.

That guilt you're depending on...

I put it all behind me.

You see, I know now what I have to do.

I have to be the best warrior
I can be.

To redeem myself,
I have to fight evil with a sword...

...and that's what I'm gonna do,
no matter what the consequences.

Damn!

Brutus...

Welcome.

You... deposited our little friend
in a safe place, I trust?

-Yes.
-Perfect.

Caesar...

They were building crosses
when I was there.

Of course.

You can't have a crucifixion
without crosses, Brutus.

You're crucifying Gabrielle...

All of them.

But you told me she would be safe. You
were only going to use her as a distraction.

Well, what would distract Xena
more than her best friend's execution?

Tomorrow, on the Ides of March...

...The very day I need Xena
most distracted.

What happens
on the Ides of March?

I'm going to make an announcement,
Brutus.

An announcement that will change history.

How are the troops looking up there?

-Excellent.
-Good...

Because in a few days, I want you to take
command of one of those legions.

The thirteenth, if you like.

-March 'em into Gaul.
-Why Gaul?

I can't tell you that right now, Brutus,
but,...

...trust me.

Marc Antony!

How are you?

I always thought I'd die in battle,
not hung on a cross.

Do you think Xena will make it in time?

She'll be here.

All right,
let's keep it simple.

I keep the vision from coming true...

...and you leave Caesar alone.

Ok, Xena.
You had your chance.

-It's Xena!
-Find her!

Xena...

I'm so glad to see you...!

Listen... That vision
is not going to happen, all right?

Here.

Take this.

Come on, Eli.
Get up!

All right, let's go!

-They're trying to escape!
-Get them!

-Go ahead! Run!
-This way!

-Run! Move!
-We need more men!

Go!

Go!

No.

Run for the woods!
Go!

No.

Go! Let's go!

No!

Get up!

I can't, Gabrielle.

It's my spine...

I can't move.

Interesting.

No, Gabrielle, no!

Gabrielle...

Xena...

You're crying?

Don't cry.

I won't.

Rest.

It won't be long, now.

Rome is under threat.

I have conclusive proof
that Caesar is responsible.

Friends!

Caesar...

-Hail, Caesar.
-Most welcome.

He thinks he's a god.

I made you leave
the way of love.

-It was my fault.
-I had a choice.

To do nothing or save my friend.
I chose the way of friendship.

I'm sorry for all the times
I didn't treat you right.

Xena...

You've brought out the best in me.

Before I met you,
no one saw me for who I was.

I felt... invisible.

But you saw
all the things that I could be.

You saved me, Xena.

I wish...

What?

...that I had 'a read your scrolls
just once.

You would have liked them.

I know.

It's time!

On your feet!

What's the matter, Brutus?

-Do you have anything to tell me?
-Tell you?

-What do you mean?
-About this...

...announcement you're going to make today.

Oh, that.

Yes, well, at first,
you probably won't like it, but...

...I plan to persuade you.

Are you ready for your trip to Gaul?

-I'll be ready.
-Good.

Don't give me that confident look.

You're about to die like a slave
and drag your friend with you...

...and it's all right by me.

Your lord might not feel
the same way.

He sent you on a mission, didn't he?

Making Caesar dictator
was his main concern.

And once he's ruling...

...making him an agent of my lord
will be easy.

So while you lie here
helpless...

...he's declaring himself emperor.

Good senators!

True patriots of Rome!

Your attention, please!

I have an important announcement
to make!

To quell civil unrest...

...I have decided to make an important
change to our government.

Gabrielle...

You were the best thing in my life.

I love you, Xena.

And I must supply...

...the leadership
so desperately needed.

On this day...

...the 15th of March...

...I declare myself...

And you, Brutus?

Gabrielle...

Gabrielle...
