What the fuck, man?
Good morning, asshole.

Not another word.
Hands above the blanket.

Get the fuck up. Hands down.

You sit right there! And shut up!

Police officer! Freeze!

Shit!

You OK?

ls he dead?
Yeah.

He's dead.

l mean, he made a move, right?
l thought he was going for something.

There's no weapon, man.

Oh, man!

Hold it, Dennis. What are you doing,
man? What are you doing?

Hey, Dennis,
what are you doing, man?

lt's up to you.

lt's happened to all of us, man.

You're not alone.

lnternal Affairs is the most
important division on the force.

We're the cops' cops.
We set the tone.

Therefore, every lAD officer must
avoid even the appearance of evil.

lf cops are better than other people,

we have to be better than other cops.

Now, Los Angeles consistently has

the cleanest force in the country.

That's because of us.
Contrary to popular opinion,

the officers in the field
don't resent us.

Because we keep the force clean,
they have respect on the street.

Well...

let's get you started.

Yes, ma'am. Was it a two-unit car?

Listen up.
l want you to meet Raymond Avilla.

He'll be joining us as of today.

Detective Peters.

Did you get his name?

This is Smith, on the phone.

Detective Davies.

Nice to meet you.

And Sergeant Wallace,

who'll be your partner
and training officer.

Sergeant Wallace?

Hi, Raymond Avilla.
Amy Wallace, nice to meet you.

We're fine.

Good.

Can l get you a coffee?
No, l'm fine.

You wanna run and get me one?

l'm just kidding. That's your desk.

You wanna get started?
l got somebody waiting down the hall.

OK.

lt's this guy.

He was picked up in the Valley.

He admits having some cocaine on him.

He says the arresting officer
planted a bag in his car

and beat up on him
and his girlfriend.

Van Stretch.
Yeah. You know him?

From the Academy.

Do you want to pass it on
to another team?

No.

So, let's go.
lt's right down the hall.

No, we'll drive out to the Valley.

Hey, Ramon! You old horse-thief!

Good to see you!

And you! My old beat sergeant.
l heard you made it to lAD.

How's your wife?
Still busting my chops.

Some things never change. Wallace.

This man is sharp.
He'll keep you dancing.

We report to Lieutenant Grieb
on the rare occasions we find him in!

Good to have you aboard.
Come and say hello.

Wallace.

OK, tell him to get here
as soon as he can!

Who you talking to?
Nobody.

l said, who was that?
lt wasn't anybody.

Don't hit me, Van.
Did you call your boyfriend?

l don't have a boyfriend.

Don't have a boyfriend?

Then who the fuck
are you out with all the time?

Leave her alone!
Get out, Sean!

Let go!

Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on there, pal?

What's going on?
You're having a lot of fun!

Get him out of here, Dennis!

Let's go for a walk. Look at this.
Look what's going on out here.

Get some air. l'll be right out.

Are you all right?
l've had it with him, Dennis.

Man, she's on somebody else's root!

l smell it on her, Dennis!

l didn't know
it was gonna be like this!

That's the way it is.
That's the way it is, isn't it?

How many cops do you know
that have nothing?

Divorced, alcoholic,
kids won't talk to them any more,

can't get it up.

They sit in their little apartments,
alone, in the dark,

playing lollipop
with a service revolver.

You get yourself together.
Do you hear me?

You get yourself together
or you're on your own.

When was the last time
you saw Van Stretch?

Couple of years ago.

Hey, could you get somebody to sub
for me at the Galleria on Sunday?

l gotta study
for the sergeant's exams.

No problem. Hey, Fred?

l need you to work Galleria Sunday.

Shit. l can't, l got Raiders tickets.

Trafficante,
you see your kid on Sundays?

Yeah.
Give them to him.

What Oates said about your
fellow officers respecting you is,

as you know, complete crap.

Most cops hate our guts,
if they credit us with having any!

They think we went into lAD
for the promotions, which is true.

They're polite
cos they're afraid of us.

Judson, you got messages for me?
Yeah. You got 18!

l got better things to do
than be your answering service!

Yeah, it must get tense
behind that desk!

Everything's a joke
with you guys, right?

Raymond!

l'll be inside.

Holy shit!

Hey, Raymond Avilla

Dennis Peck, my partner.

Hillerman case.
Right. At the Academy.

Very impressive.
l got lucky.

Hey, it's great to see you.
Good to see you, Van.

What the hell are you doing here?

He's lAD.

He came to see you, man.

l'm gonna talk to you soon, OK?

lt's OK.

He says you forced him
to empty his pockets.

l asked him to and he wouldn't.

He said, ''Keep your hands off.''
Why were they on him?

They weren't.

Look, he wouldn't empty his pockets!

What prompted you to search him?

He's a fucking junkie!

lt's obvious.
He's jumpy, fidgety, talking fast.

Why did you hit him, Van?

l didn't.
Yes, you did.

OK, l did.
They made a move for my gun!

They both made a move for your gun?

They say you provoked.

Come on,
you know that's nigger bullshit!

Sorry.

You've had three 181s
for excessive force.

You're wearing a hole in the carpet!

l just stand up to assholes.

We tested the stuff in his pocket
against what you found in the car.

So? What does that mean? He had
two stashes - to use and to sell.

l mean, if they were different.

Off the record?

lf you need counselling, Van,
the Department will provide it.

lf you have a dependency,
you can deal with it on suspension.

But if you're caught using...

l don't have a problem!
Did you hear what l said?

What are you talking about?
Like l said, l don't have a problem.

You look like shit, man.

How's Penny, Van?

She's great.

Are we finished here?
Almost.

We'll see you at lAD.
You may bring an attorney.

All those friends
you have on the force?

You don't have 'em any more.

May l have your attention
for a minute?

l'd like to welcome you
to the New Contemporary Museum.

Andrea Dietrich's work is on view.

Hers is the first installation

in a series
of new contemporary video artists.

This was made possible by a generous
donation by Nicholas Hollander.

This is Carlos.

An erotic artist.

Hi! How are you?

Excuse me, do l know you?

You're the girl in the video.
No, l'm not.

Sorry.
Nice tie. Your wife buy it?

Yes. Nice dress. Where's the rest?

You're late.
Let's get out of here.

We've got two more hours. Be good.

Hey, tiger! How you doing?

Good.

How did it go?

OK.

l got a couple more questions
to answer at lAD next week.

Yeah?

How was your buddy Raymond?

OK. l think they bought it.

lt's my word against Superfly, right?

l talked to Heather. She said
the guest room's OK, no problem.

Thanks.

Did you have a good day?

l have a racist boss,
a small desk and a new partner.

Do you like him? Your new partner?

lt's a she.

ls she pretty?

She's pretty smart and a good cop.

Let's go to bed.

Did you have to kiss every single
person at the party tonight?

lt's my job.

lt's my job.

Hey, Heather's trying to sleep.

Heather is not asleep!

How's my boy?

Your little girl is wonderful.
She's terrific.

Did you get your messages?

No.
No?

Miriam called. And Kate called twice.
l think she needs a loan.

And a Steven Arrocas...

Steven Arrocas called
to confirm his meeting with you.

And Jay called just to say hi.

Hey, everybody.
Hi.

Hi, sugarpuss!

Hi, sweetheart.

So?
So?

So, how was your date, Lolly?

Date? My ex-wife has a date?

With who?
l'm not telling you.

l'll find out.
No, you won't.

l will.

Hi, Raymond.

Hi, Penny.
How are you?

Good. You look great.
This is my partner, Amy Wallace.

Sean looks terrific.
He's great.

Big.

Sorry l'm late. And l have another
meeting in two minutes, so...

This won't take long.
That looks pretty painful.

What? Oh, this? Yeah.

Van can be a real jerk sometimes
when he's drinking.

ls that often?
No.

You noticed any changes
in his behaviour at home?

No.

Having financial problems?
No.

ls he under
an unusual amount of stress?

No, not really.
No?

No...no.

l see. Using drugs?
No.

To your knowledge he's not
using drugs at this time?

No.

Then what's his problem?
We can't help unless we know.

You don't want to help.

You want to nail him
so you can make Lieutenant!

Are you having marital problems?

l don't think that's your business.

Seeing anybody else, Penny?
Who told you that? Van?

Listen, l have a meeting,
so if there are no more questions...

Not from me.
No. Thanks a lot.

Yeah.

Very intuitive.

Can l buy you lunch?
Yeah.

Look at that.

That's a nice car.

Plus she had the Rolex.

How you doing?

Sweetmeat, don't do this.

Sorry, you can't do it, man.
Can't do it. You got to let her go.

What?
She's my snitch.

l need her on the street.
She made me an offer.

Say it was entrapment,
you did it wrong. OK?

But l did do it right.

Say you didn't.

Come here.

Dennis, what are you doing, man?

You said you needed money,
l got you a job, right?

You needed time to study,
l got you that. Now l need something.

l can't do that, man.
All right.

Get out! Go!

OK? You all right? OK?

You still love me. l know you do.

She was my snitch, man!
What can l do?

We're fairly sure he beat up
on these people unprovoked.

He has an obvious drug problem,
plus he was rude to me!

Well, nail his ass!

How long will it take?

Two days.

Why don't you give us three?

All right, good.

Coach?

You know Dennis Peck?
Yeah, he's a great cop.

How come he's just a P2?
Cos he doesn't care to be a P3.

He's likes the streets.
He likes pussy!

Why? Are you curious, Wallace?

l'm curious. Can you set it up?
Sure.

How you doing?
All right.

Yeah. l got to go back out quick.
Want to ask me about Van?

Actually, it's about Van's wife.

You know Penny?
Of course l do.

l think that's what the problem is.

Yeah?

l'm here off the record as a friend.

Do you think
maybe Penny's sleeping around?

You're married too, right? Just
as friends - you're married too?

l'm married. He's married.

You're married?
Yeah.

Does your wife fuck around?

lt doesn't feel good, does it?

Stay away from wives.
Don't talk about them.

Do you?

Stay away from wives?
That's right.

l'll tell you about wives,

my vast, extensive experience
with wives.

They're all looking for strange,
just like you or me.

My wife, his wife, your wife,
it's all the same.

You're looking for strange.
You see a pretty girl, you look.

Here. A very pretty girl, you look.

Kee, come here a second.

Kee, this is Raymond...Aviller?

ls that right?
Close enough.

She's very pretty?
She's beautiful.

Do you want her?
Do l want her?

ln another life, l want her.

You won't get another.
l'm not looking for another.

l'll tell you what.
What?

You want to ask me any more questions
about Van Stretch,

do it officially at lnternal Affairs.

l don't need to ask
any more questions.

Good.

l got all my answers.
Thank you.

You can do better, Kee.

Very clever, Raymond.

Van moonlights 15 hours a week
doing security at the Galleria,

plus $38,000 from the department,

plus her $25,000 from the bank.
$85,000 tops.

Last March they bought a house
in Granada Hills for $402,000.

They've spent 300 grand
in 18 months!

What do you think he's doing?

lt could be a lot of things.
Think he's doing it alone?

Not Van.

Well, whatever he's doing,
the pay's good.

l can't believe
he's running the show.

Dennis could be.

Which doesn't mean he is.

We could run a financial.
We're not authorised.

Ain't nothing
like the real thing, baby!

l got another vice officer
needs work. He's a good man.

l can't use him.
Can't use him?

You know how much
shoplifters take this place for?

Your cops are all boneheads.

They're in the toilet,
doing flute recitals.

Powdering their noses. Get it!

That's why you need more.
More like Lurch?

l don't think so.

You talk to the Arrocases yet?

lt'd be nice
if you could help them out, Dennis.

You released her in front of the
station and that was your decision?

Yes.

l messed up the initial contact.
l'd have had to perjure myself.

Then, what was the fight about?
That was a personal thing.

Nothing to do with this?
No.

Who told you that?
Judson? He's full of shit!

And you're about
to take the sergeant's exam?

Yeah.

What are you interested in?
Homicide, what else?

Nothing else!

This is my wife, Liz.
Raymond Avilla, nice to meet you.

You're gonna be late for work.
l gotta go.

l'm no longer here.

Where do work on your second job?
l work at the Galleria.

Doesn't Van Stretch work there?
Yeah.

How did you get that?
Every cop in town's after it.

Dennis knows the boss.
He recommended me.

Look, l'm sorry.
This thing just came up.

l don't know, Kath.
l'll be home as soon as l can.

Look, l got to go.

Love you, too. Bye.

This had better be good!

At five o'clock, l got a call from
the watch commander at Northridge,

a guy named Judson.

He said Peck had a beef with a young
vice officer named Dorian Fletcher.

Dennis Peck?

Steven Arrocas?

My wife, Tova.

Tova.
How do you do?

Why don't you have a seat?

Would you like a drink?

Yeah. Scotch on the rocks.

l'll get the waitress.

So, how do you know Rudy?

l've known Rudy since l...
How do you know him?

We have contact!

He works for Rudy Mohr, an ex-con.

He got the job through
Rudy Mohr's paid consultant...

Dennis Peck.
That's very good.

We need to find out how many others
are moonlighting at the Galleria.

We'd have to go through every single
personnel file in the division.

So, we're going after Peck?
Si.

lf we blow this or if we're wrong...

..we're fucked.
This is your pile. This is my pile.

My pile's bigger than your pile.

We have a family business.

We manufacture fine floor coverings.
We cover the world.

We're the largest importers
of ceramic tiles in the US.

We import tile from Japan,
France, West Germany, Holland...

Steven.

l run the business.
l've run it for two years.

My parents control the stock,
everything.

They started the company.
They came here with nothing.

They were immigrants.

They did many things l could never
have done and l appreciate that.

But they don't get it.

They won't borrow,
they won't diversify.

They have no idea
how to conduct business today.

We've tried to have them
declared incompetent, but...

But they'd have to be grossly
mismanaging...and they're not.

They're just not bad enough.

l want you to kill
my mother and father.

What?

Rudy said $15,000.

$15,000. Well, l could do it
for $15,000. l could do that.

l could get a couple of gang-bangers
to shoot 'em,

cut their heads off, bury them.

Leave parking tickets
all over the house, names, addresses.

They'd love to talk.

They'll talk about you
and your lovely wife.

What're you saying?

Don't fuck with me! $15,000?

How much do you want?

l'll tell you what'll happen.

You're going to go home
and think about it.

l've thought about it.

Shut up.

And you will call me
in a couple of days.

Nice to meet you, Steven.

Can l trust you?
Of course you can trust me.

l'm a cop.

You go home to your wife.

l still gotta pull some files
on Rudy Mohr.

l can do that.
But just be back by 9.00.

l got a break on the case.
Great.

Will you close the door? lt's cold.

lf Peck is handing out extra income
to 40°/° of the division,

in effect a single officer
can control the division

by pulling favours.

lt's bullshit!
Why?

Speculation!

Then there's his association
with Rudy Mohr, a convicted felon.

ls it enough for a formal complaint?

No.

Then shut up!

l'm sorry.

But he's the most
productive officer on the force!

Do you want a great cop, who,
at the most, bends it a little bit,

or some straight pistol-ass
who gives diddley,

which this department is full of?

lt's not enough
to justify an investigation.

May we get on with it?

OK, so?

lt's clear that you're involved
in a pattern of illegal activity.

Now, we know
you're not acting alone, Van.

We're prepared to change
our recommendation of termination,

if you co-operate.
How?

You've got to identify the others.

You got to help us obtain
the evidence and testify.

And wear a wire, right?

lf necessary.

Do you want to give us a minute?

Can l talk to you?

You're not authorised
to make this deal!

lt's a violation!
Just look at him.

He wants to talk.
l am the senior partner.

Your mistakes go on my file!
Retract the offer to Van or l will.

l've got another idea.

Why don't you and Peck pull them out

and l'll decide which one's bigger?

No deal.

Come on, Van.

Big mistake, Van. Big mistake.

Do you want some sugar?
l would like a very little bit.

That much?
That's perfect.

Raymond offered me a deal.

Uncle Van doesn't have any tea.

Would you like some sugar?

Would you like some tea?

lf l roll over on you, l skate.

You skate?

He doesn't have the authority
to do that.

Don't you understand?
lt's just me. l'm all alone!

Look, l got nothing to lose, OK?

l'll put some sugar in hers.

You think l'd wear a wire on you?

Don't you ever threaten me.

ls that enough?
Oh, yes, l love sugar!

You wanted to see me?

Yeah. Thanks for coming. l thought
we should talk about our problem.

Our problem? We have a problem?

Yeah. l don't know how it happened.
We got started on the wrong foot.

Sometimes l come on a little strong.

No hard feelings?

Got a minute?

Got children?
No. You?

Eight.
Eight?

Yeah. Three by the first marriage,
three by the second,

two by the third,
one from Heather's previous marriage

and number nine's on the way.

A lot of child support.
l love kids.

Do you like 'em?
Yeah, l like 'em.

Yeah? Don't wait too long to start.

You and your wife OK?

Yeah.
Good.

Cos these new couples today,

they get so wound up in their
careers and busy with everything,

their personal life suffers,
you know?

They still do it, but it's like
they have to schedule it.

You don't hug,
you don't kiss, you don't...

You don't do it nice,
fool around like before.

lt's such a hurry,
you don't enjoy the pussy any more,

and your wife isn't getting off
like she used to.

Maybe she's... No, no, there's
nothing going on you can point to,

but you start wondering.

You're talking about yourself, right?

No. l'm talking about you, Raymond.

Me?
Yeah.

Not because l see it in you.
l see it in your wife, in Kathleen.

You see it in my wife?

Yeah. ln fact,
l saw her earlier at the museum.

Yeah?

She has long blonde curly hair?
Yeah.

She has green eyes.
She had two earrings in her left ear.

Pretty. A bit skinny for me, but
they say skinny ones give good head.

l'll tell you what. l'll fuck her
a while, teach her how to come...

Get up!

They said you were a good boxer.
You are.

Not ba...not bad!
Clean yourself up.

Give my best to Kathleen!

Hi.

Hi.

You know how many wives
Dennis Peck has?

Four.

l want to
run complete bank checks on them.

Mortgages, loans, everything!

What do you say?

Please.

And he opens his bag
and takes out a box.

Remember ''Belle de Jour''? The box?

Well, he opens this box
and he takes out a paintbrush.

What? A paintbrush?
No, a number 6 sable brush.

Oh, God!

l tell you,
this guy is a great painter!

Hi, Raymond.

Hi.

Night-night.
Get some sleep.

l will. Good night, Raymond.

So Carlos is a good painter, is he?

Were you listening
to our conversation?

What did May mean by that?

l think she means
that he's not like Peter,

that he takes his time
and makes her feel good...for once.

Sweetheart, you're a good painter.

When you paint.

l guess l should buy a sable brush.

Yours is fine.

You just need to dip it.

Hello?
Penny, it's me, Van.

How are you?
l'm all right.

l'm gonna talk to Raymond.

l've got to get
all this stuff off my chest.

Are you still there?
l'm here. All what stuff?

All the stuff
we've been doing with Dennis.

l mean, l'm on my own now.

They're gonna throw me off
the force!

Raymond'll cut me a deal.

Don't you think
we should talk about this?

Penny, can l come home?

No.

No, Van not now...

l...l got to get up early tomorrow.

l'll take Sean
to my Mom's in the morning, OK?

Van?

Hello?

Don't say anything to anyone
before you see me, OK?

OK?

OK.

l'm really sorry, Penny.

You know...you know l love you.

Me too.

See you.

So, l talked to Chief Healy.

What did he say?

The guy knows you're a good cop.

l told him you're in a programme.
He liked that.

He's a family guy, too, so...

the sooner you and Penny
get back together...

You'll have to take a suspension...

But...

he's gonna overrule
any recommendation to terminate.

Thanks, partner.

Sure.

You'd do the same for me, right?

You know l would, man.

Thanks a lot.

17-Adam-79, officer needs help.
All units, all units, stand by.

Go ahead, 17-Adam-79.
17-Adam-79, officer needs help.

l'm at the 4,000 block
of West Long Beach.

There has been shooting.

Partner is down and has been shot.
Suspect has been shot and is down.

Request ambulance.

Help me.

All right, all right.

l'm shot.
lt's OK.

l'm shot!
lt's OK.

Oh, my God!
You're not gonna die.

You're not gonna die. You're not...

Gotta get back to my patrol.
lt's OK. You're not gonna die.

lt's all right. lt's OK.

Shut up! Shut up!
