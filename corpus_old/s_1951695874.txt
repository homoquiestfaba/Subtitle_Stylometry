things that I can...

you have been a good boy for a long time

you know you wanna do this

and the wisdom...

...wisdom to know the difference

Taking, as He did, This sinful world

as it is, Not as I would have it

Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,

that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

And supremely happy with
Him forever and next.

Amen

the only thing that would have
made this evening more perfect...

Emma, she called to
congratulate me, right?

nothing she does is
wrong with you, is it?

I'm thinking about what
I didn't say in the speech

oh...

you made us all laugh

i don't think anybody fold left down

they have their dance class tonight

you can just drive by...

...and look at them

there's not harming,
and just having a look

I though the food tonight was very good
but I was not crazy about the dessert

would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet?

Ok

norad is an adorable small dog

the labrador is supposed to be brave

Goltys, when he goes into
the trailer is very happy...

don't let me do this,
don't let me do this, please

I don't wanna start again

you promised to, you promised to

I'm going to stay up a while

anyway?

I though you were
wonderful tonight Mrs Brooks

thank you Mr. Brooks

oh, I love the road my
boy! I' have missed this...

we are going to have so much fun

this is the last time Marshall,
Understand me? It's the very last time!

don't you dare, going
on your business, shut up

I wanna see what they are doing

hello

what the fuck!

be quiet!

uh, Earl

what the fuck is this?

these fucking pigs like to
do with the curtains open

You should have know now this
is a big mistake for you, Earl

almost like a wanted

Earl. I don't give you that

don't even think about it

you know the rules

now upstairs, make love
with your beautiful wife

thank you

there's just a thumbprint, right there

one his, one hers?

that was really nice

this guy has not been
acting for over 2 years

he always rearranges the bodies
but this is weird, I care of dare

usually he is much more romantic

arms around each other, kissing...

mouths open, tongues touching

bullets from straight of the victims

killer would covered this a lot

these were open or
closed when you got here?

closed

could it be the work of a copycat?

that's never been or viewed to the
public that the killer will treat his logs

Jesus, I was hoping
this guy was out or dead

or in jail or in some other charge

we checked all neighbourhood,
but so far nobody saw a thing

maybe he don't like this... he must to
be really angry at them for some reason

where do they keep their vacuum cleaner?

So I bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
there is not bag in this vacuum cleaner

I have not idea of what
the hell you are look for

he vacuums the house... and took the bag

what if he kills somebody that
did never get a vacuum cleaner?

he won't do that!

Our best hope is if someone
in there saw something

detective Tracy Atwood?

Yes
this is for you

you've been served

You, fucking asshole

I am in the middle of a fucking murdering investigation
Listen lady

i'm just a messanger, here
Hawkins,

"Mr. Brooks, your daughter is

Well I hope this is what

Ehy, can I've some water?

I'm sorry daddy

I can guess what you've done

but why don't you tell
me then I'll decide

I've dropped out the school

oh Jane

ok

uh... have you told your mother?

no, I wanted to talk to you first

Well, you gonna have to
tell her, Jane All right?

I'm not gonna do that for you

why can't you...

sit!

and then,

together, the three of us, we decide

where it goes from here

Well, I tought a lot all about this?
college is a waste of time for me

All this...

All this... how somebody know that,
half way through their freshmen year?

you did even go to college
daddy and you are successful

I wanna come work for you

she is not telling you
everything, she is hiding something

hell no!

I am not hiring right now, sweetheart

ok, but just listen to me for one second

all right?

look! what happen to the business if, God
forbid, something wouldn't happen to you?

ok

mom would probably have
to sell the strangers

look, I willing to start from the bottom

you can treat me like a regular employee

I just wanna learn everything there is
to know about welling the box business

then, when the time comes...

i can stay in the family

all that's sweet, honey, but

you are not talking about business, you
are talking about emotions, now get up...

infact, Your mother and I, came...
this close to selling out last year

what?

that's right, and hadn't will
been offered a little more money

and still, may come back to us...

we would sell

what would you do without business?

yes?

I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I'll give this to you, he claims

that you'll find what's
inside, very interesting

what is he, Sunday? is he a salesman?

No, I've never seen him before

I'll just give him back
and I'll tell him to call

No, Sunday, Sunday, here...

Thank you

Jane

to give yourself a chance to...

uh, find out...

who you are

and what you wanna do

I'll talk to mom

but I not going back to school

and where would you live?

saved money, i'll look back home

but new rules, I wanna
be treated as adult

would you pay for rent?

would you pay for food?

no dad, you are a very welfy man
I think you can effort to keep me

Sunday, would you escort the
gentleman who gave you the envelop...

into the conference room and
tell him i would meet him there?

no problem, Mr Brooks

and, uh...

what happen to the BMW, Jane?

a friend is gonna drive it up
but he will be here week-end

and get Jane a cab

call your mother

are you gonna gimme a job?

if you were up to me and I think your
mother will agree with this, I, uh...

I think you should go back to school

you see that Marshall?

that's why I didn't wanna
do that damned couple

stop with fucking widing your own

you enjoyed doing that couple just as
as much I did and look at the right side

he cames to us, he didn't go to the cops

if he's trying to shake us
down, we kill him, period.

we make it fun but we'll kill him

end of the story

what can I do for you, Mister...

Let's say... Smith

Ok Mr. Smith

before you get the wrong impression, Mr
Brooks, I'm not here to shake you down

I hope this is the only copies of
these photos and you have no others

no

I have other copies and other photos

and if anything happens to me...

how did you find me Mr. Smith?

you are the man of the year, Mr. Brooks

your picture is in the paper

and if it had not been... I don't know,
I don't know what I would have done

lucky me

what is it that I can help you with?

I've been watching
that couple for months

yeah, they liked to make
love with the blinds opened

sometimes I would... take pictures

visual aids, for later

is a great way to get
off, I tell you that

was fun, I though

until I saw you killed them

and I have never

ever felt out that... rush!

like that, ever

I know you are the thumbprint killer

you have done this before

what I want?

it's for you, to take me with
you next time you kills someone

and I'd like that to be soon

and you were worried this
was going to be unpleasant?

the answer is simple

Just tell Mr. Smith that you
have decided never to kill again

and you're going away

you enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

in a word, yes

where do you think he
has the other pictures?

he put it in a safety deposit box

but I bet the box is in the banks
where he keeps his checking account

and the key...

it's on his key chain

he really wants us to do this

he is not going to the cops

we have a deal?

for the angle of these pictures...

you live at the 3rd floor at apartment building
across the alley, front of the couple house

uh

yes or no, Mr. Smith?

yes

what time did you get home from work?

6.30

7, depending of the traffic

you can't never come here again

you can't never call me
do you understand that?

yes

tomorrow night

not tonight, tomorrow night at 8 o'clock

leave your apartment
building and walk east

I will pick you up there

if you are thinking
about doing anything...

for both to aware the rules, Mr. Smith

but I feel I must warn you

if it turns out that you enjoy killing

you can become very addicted

it can ruins your life

I wanna do this

have I covered everything?

I can't think of anything else

then I'll see you
tomorrow night Mr. Smith

we've talked to our client and in common we put here
what we figure out, we feel this is more than fair

we can have a check for that
amount in your office by 6pm o'clock

oh, we told you at the
beginning what we wanted

and it hasn't changed

we feel our offer is more than generous

I paid for everything,
when we were together

and now I'm been asked
to give this guy a bonus?

for spending time with me, time that
I've already paid for in the first place?

you know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not gonna get a million five

oh, I - don't -
know that, no, I...

well, infact, this is the
front page of yesterday's paper

"Hangman escapes"

after torturing his victims

Thorton Meeks

well, hide him in public places,

church steeple, balconies,
freeways over passes...

where this is going?

Well, your client captures Mr. Meeks

Come on Tracy, this is
not a lot of money for you

and we both know how afraid that I was after Meeks
says that he was gonna escape and come back to kill you

let me ask again

what is your point?

Our point is that Meeks,
or someone like Meeks

make hurt after my client
in order to hurt your client

that is very imaginative, counsellor

but it's not based in reality at all

Jesse

let's just handle this, please

Tracy
Jesse

you know what will make me
feel really safe right now?

if you got hit by a truck...

and die

well, that's it?

Mr. Vialo and I, are leaving

you are threatening the safety of my client,
we are going after to get a straight order

we see in court

you hit by a truck and die?

fuck it, I felt good

what was here it's not
here, that's interesting

I hate the number, I'll say that
this people been killed by a ghost

the autopsy said there was a little tiny
piece of plastic in the female victim's brain

it's a dead end, the bag with the gun, he puts one
gallon plastic foresinc bag over his hand to his wrist

little bit of plastic comes out, when the
first one is gonna shots, it goes in the bag

are you looking for me?

I've received the subpena from
your husband for your works records

where you worked, date and
time, for the past two years

he just tries to blackmail me, do you remember?
my lawyers assure me that I'll never go to court

I can't take that chance

almost three courts of
your cases is a current

so, until you'll set your divorce
i'm gonna have to put you on the desk

that's also blackmail

do you have any idea what
this guy has done to me?

while we're married, while
i was paying for everything

he was just out and fuck every
woman he can gets his hands on

he fucked my friends,
he fucked my cousin

he made me look as an idiot

and?
and what?

get over it!

you can't roll there's a woman wanna
have this one blousy man in your life

well, I made him an offer and I
won't goin to give him a dime more

did you hear that Meeks escaped?

yeah

you get gonna looking for him,
you want me yo put a detail on you?

I think I can take care of myself

it's one of your biggest problem,
Tracy you don't know how to ask for help

what the fuck, what the fuck, what...

don't worry, if I were here to
kill you, you were already be dead

after you left today, I realize that our
friendship was a little one side of it

so, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind us to bring

all the pictures and the
memory card from your camera

that way we can like each
other simply for who we are

if you don't show up

I will presume that you have gone
to the police and I will kill you

even if I'll go to jail because of you Mr
Smith, someone will find you, wherever you are...

and they will kill you

Mr. Brooks

Mr. Brooks

Mr. Brooks

WoW

it's nice to have you home

hello, hello. You have to explain this
to me 'cause i'm your mother, that's why!

what's wrong, girls?

I asked your daughter what's the
real reason she dropped out the school

I told you, it's not the real reason

honey...

you wanted to go to college

you have good grades, your father put
in favours to get you in that school

if this is not the reason...

please, Dear God, tell me the reason

what is your mother thinking
even dropped you out the school?

I'm pregnant

but that's not the reason I dropped out

being pregnant wouldn't keep me
for going to school if I wanted to

who is the father?

some guy a was seeing

some, some guy, does he knows?

what he knows Dad?

he is married, he got two kids,
I want nothing to do with me

oh, honey

oh, honey

I'm not gonna go throw with it

there is nothing to be upset about

I mean, I was even
not gonna tell you guys

then would be

no abortion, jane

no Dad, you're not gonna
tell me what to do, ok?

it's my body and I'll
do what I want with it

I'm sorry, you're right. i said it wrong

I wasn't trying to tell
you what to do when I was...

what I was trying to say is that...

a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

for your mother and me

would you really wanna have a
grandchild? even if I'm not married?

yes

a child is what's important

we would... we would love him and
cheer him completely and we would...

we would help you raise him

if it means that much to
you, I will think about it

I'm gonna have to start getting
up little earlier, uh, honey?

well, we were right

she was hiding something

pregnancy is not of all of it,
she's hiding something bigger

something much bigger

you think so?

I know so

and so do you

it's darker tonight
than it was on your night

but still...

how did you managed to not
bumping into the furniture?

was the light on?

or did you turn it on?

because I know you and you
won't risk a shot in the dark

where have you been?

did you miss the thrill of killing?

what if these are stayed closed

because you yanked them closed

which would mean...

they were open...

...when you came into the room

thank you, I appreciate your time

ops, sorry, i'm sorry

no, I'm sorry

I was just about to knock

I'm detective Atwood, portland police

hey, do you wanna see me?

fine

you are a photographer
Mr... Bafford?

No
No?

thank you

no,

uh, actually it's...
a hobby i just started

well, do you know, there was a murder?

yes, in the house, close the way

You didn't happen to see something
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

no, I wondered that
when it happened, but

no

I'm sorry, i'm supposed
to be meeting somebody

and I don't want to be late

uh, well, here is my card

if you did hear something
or remember anything

uh, i wish I could be
more helped, but,uh,sorry!

he looks clean

looks like he's alone

no,i tell you, he
really wants to do that

maybe I should plow
with him... pick him up

no, just honk

maybe he get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess he's doing up

almost

it's coming down hard

they said would be sunny tomorrow

I never trust those guys

they say it's gonna be clear, then rains

and they say it's gonna
rains and it's... sunny

I believe this is what you asked for

the pictures in the memory card...

all here

both

you and I both know that not
all the pictures are in here

and you made a copy of the
memory card, as an asshole

but, you understand my position?

yes, I do

but it's my hope you want to get to know me
better you feel confortable in giving me everything

that I've asked you for

sounds fair

maybe you'll be interested in this

this is the police woman,
who is looking for you

wow, we never know anyone
was looking for us before

you have to find everything
there is to know about this...

woman

this is close, Marshall

this is to damn close

so...

what's the plan?

where do we, uh, what
are we doing here tonight?

we'll drive around until we
see someone we think we might

enjoy killing

really?

you don't have have somebody... in mind?

I don't enjoy this Mr. Smith, I do it

because I am addicted to it

before you're in in my life I
had that I would never kill again

so, this is... your part

you can choose anyone you
want and we will do it together

can i pick somebody that I know?

no

you'll never kill someone you know

it's the easiest way to get caught

ok?
yeah

locked up?

you look a little bit like that...

E.T. guy

remember that movie? when
he flies on that bike?

yeah, yeah
yeah

I like that movie

Jesus Christ

fuck him

this is fault, he is an asshole

fuck you

maybe Mr Smith would like to kill

the driver of the pick up

what about the driver of the pick up?

what if we kill him?

yes

yes, I always wanted to fucking kill
somebody fucking to be in traffic

well, if you want to
kill the driver of pick up

I'll give you the honor

ehy, maybe not be the same

driver

ok

well, driver I am, to will give
a good looking at him or her

any problem to kill a woman?

no, no. an asshole is an asshole

I wasn't in town that night

my roommate was, maybe he saw something

Uh, may I speak to him?

he is in on his way to Tokyo right
now, he is also a flight attendant

did the victims ever leave
their bedroom curtains open?

all the time

I don't know if we can see them doing it and
that's why you are asking but they didn't care

well, here is my card

if you can have your roommate call me

and people of this number know how to
reach me at everytime, day and night

I won't be here, but
I will leave him a note

ok great, thank you

sure

would recognize him if you saw
his driving licence picture?

yeah

I'll memorize the licence
number, you write it down

I got it

wow

well, when you get
home, go on the Internet

find everything you
can... about this guy

we are gonna kill him tonight?

no

we could, but then we
won't be under control

we can leave lose ends but we
both know the danger of that

ok, I will do

what are... we... doing?

what are you doing?

look at me!

look at me!
why?

close your eyes
why?

close

what's the licence plate number?

shit

P4...

no

2, uh

I know I tore, then

because of the tree?

don't feel bad

I've been doing this a
long time. pen and paper

look out the window and write it down

how is your first time like?

you really don't wanna know
that much about me, Mr. Smith

no, I don't think it was right, go back

ok, we are in

for all the taxes we pay you think
they'll make it more difficult

to hack into the police personnel file

the father is John Atwood, why...

why does that ring a bell?

somebody you got business with?

someone we...

killed

no, no somebody we killed

let me see here, MBA

and married, she has
been a cop for 12 years

married Dr. Carlson

divorced Dr. Carlson
married at Jesse Vialo

and so two are separated,
from Jesse Vialo sue

...for support by Jesse Vialo seems

uhm, seem a shrimp

because of Jesse Vialo

who, who, who

she has caught a lot of people

and look here, this is not her first
time she has been looking for us

ok, here we are

Jesse Vialo, good looking,
a little younger than she is

younger, rest of all to her

she married him in a
rebound from the doctor

and the boy has married her
for money and connections

just because the old men
that doesn't mean she is rich

maybe is one of the kind of guys
ready to give her to the oprah

and than to his kids

what does she have to declare?
any outside and coming holdings?

oh, you are a...

you are a genius

the oprah didn't get much

why would a woman, worth
60 plus million dollars...

and probably more to come...

wanna be a cop?

I like that about her

you are a such a fucking snob, Earl
you like her because she is rich

no, i like her because she
founds something that's hers,

is not the family business,
and she is good at it

I'd like Jane to find
something it's... hers

and than she can be good at it

That's exactly why I would
scare the shit out of me

she's a cop who doesn't
need the money...

and she is looking for us.

that's one fucking dangerous human being

the fact you are not wrong
just not making me me admire her

any less

hey Nancy!

hi Tracy,

thank you for meeting me here

I got your latte

you wanna be walk and talk
while I hear your big idea?

oh, sure

you really wanna settle this?

If I can

I'd like to use your father

no

my father does nothing for nothing

Tracy, I understand but your
father has a lot of political massed

his poll won't make everything go away

but it would be a tremendous help

absolutely not

you're right

we could have done this one on the phone

if you will wanna play the game
right on the desk for a year

i'm sure we can settle it
at 1,25- 1,5... - uff, I...

I'm not sit on a desk

an the only other option is your father

or money

1,5 and that's it

ok

I'll call them today

I just need to get this
done as soon as possible

that's what Jesse is counting on

I'll call you when I have something

oh, Tracy

your husband said there's a picture of him
holding some trophy, that you still have?

what picture? he has everything

he claims it's his favourite picture

and you put it up when
you store your suitcases

I'll look

I Know?

petty, you are going to divorce

thanks for the latte

I told you I was coming back to get you

how do you find the place
where i'm gonna hang you?

first

I'm gonna watch her

have some fun with you

then she is gonna watch
me, have some fun with you

you know...

don't fucking move!

shoot me!

come on, shoot me, motherfucker
