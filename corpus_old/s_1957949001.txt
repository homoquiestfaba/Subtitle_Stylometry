Gil.


Hey Walter.

there?

Well just walking the grounds.

Jesus Christ, Walter,

how'd you keep this
place open for so long?

I'm seeing like six or
seven code violations.

The damn cabins are falling
apart.

that's why we have you there.

I need that campsite up
and running within a week.

And given your current snuafion,

I didn't figure some hard
work and fresh air would hurt.

That wasn't me complaining,
Walter.


Walter, this nurse and
these kids, they know about...

that you're a handyman

and that's all they need to
know.

Walter...

need to know anything else

other than you and miss
hemsgrove are in charge.

So they're showing up today?

within the next few hours,

Gil, just do me a favor.

What?

old enough to drink,

so be patient with 'em.

Great.
You'll be fine.

Listen, I'm gonna jump off here,

I just wanted to check in and
make sure

everything was going okay for
ya.

Thanks Walter.


I'll call you tomorrow to check
in.

Have a good one.

You too.

little lost.

_ uh... (Women giggle)

Yeah, where you tryin' to find?

Uh, brook haven Metro park?

Uh, (chuckles) It's
um, five miles that way.

(Women giggle)

Thank you.
Oh.

(Gentle, dramatic music)

(Hammer thumping)
(Energetic, rock music)

(Doors clatter)

My friends, we have arrived.

(Woman talking quietly)
(Door clatters)

for several days of food,

booze and debauchery.

We can talk about the first
two, but,

let's take it easy on the
latter.

Well hello Mr. Tall drink of
water.

Who is you?

I believe that would be Mr.
Gil.

He's in charge of the
construction program.

last name?

Why don't you guys get settled
in?

I'm gonna go talk with him.

Um, and just to be clear,

there is plenty of room in my
bunk

for you two fine-ass women.

Her loss, I guess that just
leaves you, Hannah Montana.

Yeah, I'd rather sleep on
salty, glass-covered pavement.

(Gravel crackling)



I'll be your acting...

Nurse, yeah, Walter told me.

And you must be gillum Ross?

Just Gil.

Well Walter's had
nothing but great things

to say about you, Gil.


Um, just thought I'd
come introduce myself

since we're gonna be working
together the next few days.

Well, I don't wanna disturb you.

Uh, just be careful
out there, all right?

What do you mean?

Oh, I haven't walked the
rest of the grounds yet,

so I've already found some
hazards, so there'll be others.

Just be careful, and if you
find a hazard, come to me.

Understood.

And, it would be kind of bad

if something happened to
our site nurse, right?

No, we wouldn't want that now,
would we?

Someone's liable to get
a bandaid on an ankle, so.

Duly noted.

(Door rattles)

Welcome to the pine Hilton,
boys.


Did you get a side of
tetanus shot with this cabin?

(Insects singing)

(Door squeaks)

(Switch clicks)

(Door squeaks)

(Bags rustling)

(Zipper buzzes) (Door clatters)


Ew, dude, get the fuck outta
here.

What, you know you want me in.

Bye Charlie.

So, what are you ladies up to
today?

Uh, we're probably gonna lay
out.


I think I'm gonna go
see what Mason's up to.

Obvious much?

What?

Mason is a hunter.


Jesus fucking Christ,

guys like Mason like the
unobtainable.

They like the thrill of the
chase.

Okay.

Okay, so he's a lion, and
you're a fucking elephant.

I'm not fat.

For fuck sake, Mason
takes one look at you

and he knows he can have you

because, like an elephant,
you're just there,

and fucking obvious.

Mason wants a gazelle that he
can chase down and tear apart.


(claps hands) I'm gonna
go get some work done.

You girls have a good day.

(Door rattles)

(Quiet, ominous music)

(Engine humming)
(Quiet, ominous music)

(Keys clink) (Rattle)

could just have to do.

Well, right to life, right?


(Doors clatter)

(Woman sighs)

(Leaves crackling)

Well I'm sure we'll
find some great spots

to take some photo shots.

Yes, I think so.

(Leaves crackling)
(Quiet, ominous music)

(Upbeat, rock music)
(Hammer thunking)

(Courtney chuckles)
That was really rude.

That's not what I meant,
she took it the wrong way.

(Hammer thunking)
(Upbeat, rock music)

What are you looking at my
girls for?

(Upbeat, rock music)

(Hand smacks ass)

(Men horse playing)
(Upbeat, rock music)

(Insects singing)


I'm gonna find you.

(Insects singing)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

Oh, I see what game
we're playing now, huh.

(Ominous, rhythmic music)
(Insects singing)



You mightjust win me.


Oh, I like that.

Oh. (Giggles)

(Blond sighs)

(Blond giggles)

(Rhythmic, upbeat music)

(Nicole moans)

that 65% of all people

have sex while they're camping.

You get service out here?

Yeah.

Bullshit, there's no way.

Why?

Because it's a proven fact

that once people get away
from the fuss of civilization,

they let their primal side come
out.

This number's gotta be higher.

How much higher?

95%, at least.

Eh, I highly doubt it.

Why, I mean, think about it,

campfire, peace and quiet,

nobody around for miles,
primal instincts kick in, baby.

(Men chuckle)
Well,

you obviously don't
understand how pussy works.

(Rhythmic, upbeat music)
(Nicole moaning quietly)

Yeah, not to mention it'd
be, like, super uncomfortable.

I mean, scraped knees, elbows,

branches and rocks under you,
eh.

You need to shut that shit down.

It just means you're not
doing it right, Courtney.

Always be on top.

That's right.
Good point.

That's right, always be on top.

And by the way, they make
stereotypes about this thing

in horror movies and stuff,

and there's gotta be a
reason for that, right?

Yeah. (Courtney laughs)

Yeah, and girls just love it

when you stick it up their
ass, just like in porn, too.

Really?

Realiy.

No, I was being fascist.

Facetious.


(Upbeat, rhythmic music)
(Accelerated breathing)

(Nicole gasps)

grab me that bottle of spf.

Today, preferably.

Whoa, hey tiger.

(Men mutter)

Don't miss my shoulders.

I mean, don't get me wrong,
though,

if I was walking through the
woods

and that Gil guy showed up...

That guy?

He's like 40!

Not to mention, he's as bald
as Tasha's stabbing cabin.

like bald guys and he's older,

which means he doesn't
have to be trained as much.

Amen to that. (Grunts)

Just right in there, bro',
just right, (pops tongue)

Yeah bro', get in there.

(Nicole gasping)
(Upbeat, rhythmic music)

You like that, baby?

(Nicole gasping) Nicole, Nicole!

(Foot thunks) (Nicole gasping)


(Men laughing)
What?

seconds.

It's human nature, it's primal.

(Group laughing)


Oh. (Laughs)

What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this?

you're not a two-pump chump.


How about you and I
take a walk over there?

Mm, walk huh?

Mmhmm.
Mmm, is that all?

Oh no, I'm pretty sure we
can figure other things to do.

Mm, oh yeah?
Oh yeah.

(Insects singing)

What's happening, hot stuff?

I thought you guys went
to lay out or something?

We were, but Charlie got
religion

while putting sunscreen on me.

What?

I can't reach my back.

Uh huh.

It's not what you think.

Oh sure.

You know what, I don't
think you're as immune

to the rigors of careless
sex after all, nurse Betty.

Contrary to popular belief,

there are more important things
to talk about than just sex.

Really, like what?

Like fixing this cabin.

And Mr. Gil is doing a great
job adhering to all the rules

and I think we should follow his
example.

(Engine humming)
(Hammer thumping)

(Birds chirping)
(Insects singing)

(Door clatters)

Well,

looks pretty nice.

I like it out here.

This is nice,

real nice.

Help you with something?

setup out here, huh?

It's all right.


Yeah, I'll say it's all right.

Jesus, wide, open space,
freedom to go about your day,

I bet you get a nice workout
out here too, don't ya?


Sure.

Yeah, it's really nice.

Oh, and the poon walking around
here,

holy Mary mother of fuck.

Bet you're just in heaven
out here, aren't you?

Come on, Gil, you can't tell me

the thought hasn't crossed your
mind.

After five years, I would've
thought you would have

worn one of these fur burgers
as a flesh condom by now.

Are you kidding?

Look at him, he would
wanna bitch any one of us

if given the opportunity.

You can see it in his eyes.

I seriously doubt that.

Well, we'll see about that.

for you.

So was my therapist.

God.

Uh, five oh is here.

Did somebody order bacon?


Ah, there he is.

What's wrong, push your button?

No sir.

No sir?

That's really good.

See, it'd a been a shame if you
timed out

to go right back in, assaulting
an officer of the law.

Know what I mean?

Is there something I can
help you with, officer?

And you are?

the nurse here at the camp.

Mrs. Hemsgrove.

Miss.

Ah miss, well, no need to be
alarmed,

just taking up my friend, Gil
here,

standard procedure to
keep tabs on ex-cons.

Wait, so this guy's an ex-con?

They can't be around
girls and such, right?

Depends on what they were
locked up for.

Mr. Gil's doing a find job.


That's cute.

You're interrupting Mr. Gil's
job,

so if there was something,

someone you'd like to speak
with...

No no no, that's not necessary.

(Door clatters)

You behave yourself, Gil,

I don't wanna get any phone
calls

from any of these fine ladies,

saying that you've misbehaved.

We clear?

Crystal.

Well that's good.

All righty, you folks have a
great day.

We'll see you soon, Mr. Gil.

something to do?

Tsk tsk tsk, naughty boy.



(Knife patters) (Liquid burbles)

(Quiet, ominous music)
(Insects singing)

(Lighter clicking)

(Flames crackling)

Hey.
Hey.

(Chair rattles)

Thanks.
Yeah.

There she is.

so what's the skinny?

The skinny, people
still say shit like that?

Yes, just 'cause I'm a little
older

doesn't mean I don't
still know the hip lingo.

(Group giggles)
Yeah, the hip lingo, okay.

No uh,

we were actually just
discussing our ex-con handyman.

Listen, I get you guys

may be a little confused
or on edge, but trust me,

you literally have nothing to
worry about.

Why, just 'cause the
boss-man said it's cool?

Yeah, that makes me feel so much
better.

Things like this is normal.

Sometimes when people's
been in the system,

they need a little
assistance on a job and Mr.,

I mean, he's been staying to
himself.

Just leave him alone.

All I know is people like that

have a lot of pent up aggression
and shit.

Oh yeah, and how many
ex-con men do you know?

That's what I thought.

And you too, weren't you just
saying

you were into his sexy, working
man vibe,

literally a few hours ago?

(Clears throat) Yeah, you were.

That was before they knew
he got locked up, though.

I think it just makes it sexier.

Always a sucker for
the bad boys, huh Tasha?

Lay off Gil already,
he's keeping to himself,

we don't need you all making
it a little bit awkward.

I still wanna know what
he was locked up for.

My bet's drugs.

I think he got caught running.

Nah, he looks like a
breaking and entering guy.

(Gil whistles) (Dramatic music)

Jesus Christ, creep much?

Miley.

What?

I just came to check out the
fire.

(Quiet, dramatic music)

So come on, Gil, what'd
you get locked up for?

business.

Well, about five years ago,

friend of mine, came, asked for
help,

he got in with some bad
people, owed a lot of money.

What's a lot?

About 500.

lot.

$500,000.

Fuck.
Damn.

So what happened?

Well, he came to me, had
a plan about scrapping cars

to make money to pay the debt
off.

Doesn't sound like you'd
make that much money.

I mean, not $500,000.

Well it wouldn't, but if
you can make cars disappear,

it would.

Cars that belong to very bad
people.

And so that's what we did,
we made cars disappear.

Wait a second, you're
telling me you ran a chop shop?

We did.

And the money flowed in like a
flood.

He was able to pay off his debt.

Shoulda stopped though.

We didn't.

We got greedy.

So how'd you get caught?

Eh, it seems we weren't as
close as I thought we were.

Cops got wind of the
operation, brought him in,

basically offered him a deal

which would pin the whole thing
on me.

So he sold you out.

Damn dude, that is cold blooded.

Yeah, he uh, basically got
probation

and I got 10 years,
sentenced to state prison,

Lebanon state prison,

served five, got out on good
behavior.

(Chuckles non-humorously)
Fuck.

To Gil.

The unluckiest car-killer alive.

(Glasses clinking)

Hey, where are you two headed
off to,

the party's just getting
started.

Eh, we're gonna take a little
stroll

and make a little party of our
own.

Now guys, stay close, take a
flashlight.

But if we're too close,
you'll hear us. (Giggles)

Try to keep some
reservations about yourselves.

Yeah, and uh, watch out
for snakes and poison Ivy,

and um, herpes.

(Groups laughs)
Fuck you, douche schnakal.

Hey, if that's an offer, I
am down for a love sandwich.

Courtney, you can be the roast
beef

oh. (Laughs)

(Group laughing)

Fuck off.

Roast beef? (Laughs)

I know you love roast beef,
dude.

Listen, roast beef, (laughs)
Wait here,

count to 10, and then follow
the trail and come find me.

Why?

'Cause I have a surprise for
you.

What kind of surprise?

It's gonna be a big surprise,
it's gonna blow your mind.

Okay. (Laughs)

So you're in to bad boys?

I could be a bad boy.

(Insects singing)
(Fire crackling)

Where you headed off to?

Anywhere you're not. (Hands
slap legs)

(Fire crackling)
(Insects singing)

Tah dah!


Yeah?

You wanna get in the tent
or you wanna mull it over?


Get in. (Zipper buzzing)

look.

I brought a bag of toys.
Oh.

And bug-free.

All right, so I admit, I like
the tent,

but explain this.
What?

Oh this.
Yeah.

Oh, you know how cosplay is my
kink.

Uh huh.
Yeah,

you remember the thing with the
fairies?

Mmhmm.
Shh,

let's not talk about that,
it was a dark time for us.

But this, like look,
we're out in the woods,

it's like an 80's movie
with the hockey masks

and the stabbings and things
like that,

and I'm like the unruly
camper and you're like

the hot, sexy, camp counselor
that I'm just tryin' to fuck.

Yeah.

usually die in those movies?

Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.


Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.


Oh, or, I could be a bounty
hunter.

talkin'.

You're under arrest.

You have the right to remain
naked,

you take that off and I'll take
this off,

'cause I have that right too.

It's equal rights around here.

You have the right, give
me this, goddamn it.

Just take that off, fuckin',

(clothing clatters) (Laughs)

Anything you say can and
will be held against my body.

Your dick smuggling days are
oven

you will take these off
and you are going downtown,

gimme, gimme 'em.

You know, if you ask
me, that's just rude.

I mean, we're all here,
having a good time, right,

having fun, and they
just get up and walk off.

Come on!

(Door rattles) (Mason whistles)

I didn't think you got the hint.

Oh, I got it.

You got it, huh?

Yeah.

Wanna see it?
(Rhythmic, sassy music)


(Rhythmic, sassy music)

Well uh, I guess it's just
you and me, kitten whiskers.

(Miley chuckles quietly)

No Charlie.

It's just you, boo.

I'm crashing.

(Fire crackling)

I think I'm in love.

that's fine.


Get over here, criminals.

All right, so, woop, you
like these underwear,

you criminal, that's right, you
do.

Get out of here.

Here.

Here we are.
Oh.

There we go.

(Courtney breathing heavy)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

There you go.

Gotta like that,

you're the best camp
counselor I've ever had.

Too bad I had to arrest you.


Oh now, mm mm, we did cowboys
last time.

Okay, sorry sorry sorry.

(Upbeat, rock music)

(Tasha groaning)
(Upbeat, rock music)

(Door clatters)

(Upbeat, rock music)

So uh, I'm like super
tired, I mean it's like,

what time, like 2:00?

10:30.


Shit.

Tell you what, man, in the
shed, underneath the mattress.

Okay.

So, what are you doing here?

You know my story, what's yours?

Not much of a story to tell.

Oh, I don't believe that for a
second.

What makes you say that?

Well because Walter told
me a little bit about you.

Graduated St. Johns in a dsnc
with para-anesthesiology.

Impressive.

Just because I'm a simple guy

doesn't mean I'm a stupid
one, miss hemsgrove.

Ah, I knew you'd like this
mullet ride.

(Courtney mutters)
Ah, I know,

that's what mullets do,
they're magical. (Grunts)

(Courtney giggles)
(Will grunting)

All right, okay.

All right, you criminal,
'bout ready to take you in.

Yeah?
Oh yeah.

Okay. (Grunts)

Okay, oh okay. (Grunts)

magic, baby.

Oh. (Exhaling)


Did you like that?


You gotta pee?

Well don't do it here.

(Courtney laughs) (Mutters)

Do you think I could
grow a mullet on my pubes?

(Zipper buzzes)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

(Creature squishing)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

(Magazines clap)
(Charlie exhales)

God fuckin' bless you, Gil.


(Door clatters)

(Upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha groaning)

(Quiet, dramatic music)

(Creature squishes)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

So, why after all of that,

would you be wasting your
skills as a nurse here?

Seems like, to me, you're
running from something.

Or someone.

(Upbeat, rock music)

(Stool screeches)

(Upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha grunting)

Let's just say,

when you're in a
relationship with your boss,

it casts a dark shadow over
someone with a career like mine

and when said boss fails to
let you know that he's married,

yeah.

Then you just move locations,

you don't take the cheapest
paying lob,

watching a bunch of kids.

(Dramatic, suspenseful music)

What the fuck is that?
(Shrieking)

Yeah, they seem a little
rough around the edges at times,

but they're really good kids.

Well, to us, society's misfits.

(Bottles clink)
(Vanessa chuckles)

(Gentle, quiet music)

(Birds chirping)
(Gentle, quiet music)

(Clomping footsteps)

(Door clatters)

cheeks.

Now you're just teasing me.

Rough night?

Oh, I was just being a lion
tamer.

(Chair clatters)

What's up her ass?

Miss hemsgrove.


Missing somebody?

You know, I've not seen
will or court this morning.

That's funny, I didn't hear
'em come in last night either.

You apparently wouldn't have
heard shit after all this...

(Charlie slams table)

Anyways, he didn't sneak into
your guy's bunk last night,

did he?

close.

I'm sure they're fine.

I'll go look for them in a
minute.

I'm sure they just uh,
passed out after their walk.

Anyone of you know how much

a fully grown brown bear weighs?

About 500 pounds. (Sighs)

you're joking.

Nope.

But do I think something
happened?

Not really.

But it's something that needs
to be on all of your minds

if you decide to trek
out into the woods alone.

Well uh, I'll make sure
to keep that in mind,

but do we, by chance have, like,

a rifle on site, or
something, just in case?

Forgot, ex-con.

Tell you what, Chuck,

why don't you use your winning
personality

if you run into wildlife?

It should be a solid deterrent.

By the way, you smell like
Mason's dick.

Oh, better than smelling
like loneliness and depression.

(Women chuckle)

(Vanessa mutters)
(Door clatters)

(Woman screaming)
(Chairs clatter)

[Woman] Help me, help me!
(Screaming)

Help me!

Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa!
Let go of me!

Easy, easy. (Woman screaming)

(Dramatic, ominous music)

Let me go!
Chill! (Grunts)

You don't understand, it's out
there!

My friends, they're all...

(Gil groaning)
Jesus Gil,

are you okay?

God.
Come help me.

Get him up.

(Gil grunting)

Somebody get her up and
let's get her to the med-bed.

this bitch?

grandpa, I'll carry her.

(Gentle, dramatic music)
(Birds chirping)

(Men grunt)


(Gentle, ominous music)

(Lighter clicks)
(Gentle, ominous music)

Will!

Will, where are you?

(Mason grunts)

(Labored breathing)
(Quiet, ominous music)

She's so bloody.

Laceration on her forehead,

laceration on left thigh.

(Vanessa sighs)

You okay?

little unexpected is all.

Are you okay?


What the hell happened to her?

(Gentle, ominous music)

Courtney!

Will!

Was that roast beef an all-night
buffet?

(Gentle, ominous music)

She's stable for now.

Let's check back on her in a few
hours.

Afew hours?

What the fuck did you hit her
with?


Okay, so what do we do now?

time to make that call.


Tash, can you go and get the
sat. Phone?

You two, I want everyone back
at this camp before sunset,

no more wandering around.

Go get Charlie, look
for will and Courtney,

bring 'em back here to
the nurse's station.

(Vanessa sighs)

(Gentle, ominous music)

What the fuck?

(Rustling leaves)
(Gentle, ominous music)

Jesus fucking Christ.

(Leaves rustling)

(Zipper buzzes)

Oh shit.

I guess we're doing this.

You all right?

I don't know, just
something's not right.

Other than the obvious?

Maybe I'm being paranoid,
but (chuckles non-humorously)

She comes running out of
nowhere,

damn near ferrel,

talking about something being
out in the woods. (Sighs)

We're about 50 miles away
from the nearest civilization,

it's not really painting a...

Gil, you might wanna come look
at this.

What now?

Clean up, you look like shit.

I'll figure out what's going on.

(Quiet, foreboding music)

Oh shit.
(Quiet, foreboding music)

What the fuck?
(Dramatic, menacing music)

(Charlie screaming)

(Quiet, eerie music)
(Insects singing)

You okay?

Yeah, my ankle still hurts a
bit.

Let me see.

(Gentle, quiet music)

Oh yeah, definitely a sprain.

(Miley grunts)

Sorry.

Um, you're fine.

You think you could get
my shoulders instead?

I just feel so tense.

Yeah, sure.

(Gentle, quiet music)

(Miley groans)

You don't feel that tense.

Let me ask you something.

Go for it.

Why Tasha?

What?

You and Tasha, I don't get it.

Miles, it's not like we're...

There's nothing special about
her

and there's nothing that
she can do that I can't.

Or better.

(Gentle, quiet music)

Miles look, there's just
nothing here between you and I.

I mean...

There could be.

(Gentle, quiet music)


we are in two different leagues.

You need a good guy and
I am not a good guy.

Maybe I don't want a good guy.


I'm sorry.

Fine, have fun with your
cum guzzling gutter slut!

What did you do now?

(Gentle, foreboding music)

(Door clatters)
(Gentle, foreboding music)

(Door rattles)
(Gentle, foreboding music)

(Grass rustling)
(Gentle, foreboding music)


Stay down.
Who the fuck are you?

hemsgrove.

You're at pine hills camp.

(Fist thumps)
Ow! (Grunts)

Gil, give her some space.

hitting me?

with?

A sedative.

The effects have not worn off
yet.

I promise, no one's gonna hurt
you.


in with a hair trigger.

Sorry.
Jesus.

name?

Jane.


if you say your last name is
Doe...

Fuck off.

doing out here, Jane?

We were on vacation.

My friends and I were camping.

Something,

something attacked us.

There's something in the woods.

Whoa whoa whoa, sit.

What kind of something?

I don't know, some animal, a
monster.

What the hell are you
talking about, what monster?

It hunted us down.

It killed my friends.

It killed,

Alex.

exactly what happened,

are there others out there?

They're dead, they're all dead.

gotta call somebody.

Where's the sat. Phone?

Smashed.

I don't know how...
What?

It's a no go.

will, Courtney, Charlie?

Nobody's come back yet.

God, what is going on?


There are people missing.

She shows up, talking about her
friends

are being killed by some
monster?

she's the most reliable source

of information right now,
Vanessa.

three counselors missing

and after what I've seen
the past few hours...

about now?

Come look at this.

(Quiet, foreboding music)

The fuck is that?

I don't know, but it
came out of Jane's leg.

She's sick, contagious?

I don't know.

(Gil snaps fingers)

No bullshit, what is that all
overyou?

Pick a friend.

Let's hear about this monster
of yours.

(Miley crying)

(Distant popping)

Tasha?

Just go away, okay?

You were right, (crying)

I'm not a gazelle, I'm just
a fucking elephant. (Crying)

(Ominous, foreboding music)
Tasha?

(Miley screaming)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

That's the last thing I
remember.

I woke up, heard some
not-too-friendly shit in the woods,

stumbled up on you
people, and here we are.

bullshit, it's gotta be bullshit.

But you said you killed
the thing, though, right?


There wasn't much left.

Gil?

I'll start the car.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what?

You don't actually believe
this horseshit, do you?

Listen, Abercrombie, you
wanna hang around here,

be my guest.

What about the others,

we're just gonna fuckin'
take off and leave 'em?

Mason's right, Gil, I'm not
leaving those kids out there.

We gotta go find them.

So we go out there and risk
something

happening to all of us?

I am with Gil, I say we
hightail it the fuck outta here.

And what if it was you?

If I was stupid enough
to go out there alone,

I'd expect you to spill one for
your homey

and get the fuck outta dodge.

Bitch.

Hey, don't sit there and act
like

you'd be all heroic for me
if I was the one out there.

You can't go out there.

If there are more of those
out there, believe me,

your friends are more than
likely dead.

Well, (sighs) I'm not gonna
sit here

and listen to this horseshit
anymore.

There are no goddamn monsters
out here

and I'm not gonna bolt all
because some crack whore

decided she was gonna run into
camp

and tell us all about her
friends

that got killed by some Gil-man.

(Door clatters)

Actually, they were ripped apan.

Vanessa.

Gil, please.

Goddamn it, all right, fine,

Vanessa and I will go look for
the others,

you guys stay here in case they
come back.

Nice try, handsome,
but I'm not staying here.

Didn't you just say it was
smarter not to go out there?

(Chuckles, unamused)
And I still stand by that.

However, I'd be more
comfortable with you out there

than stuck here.


Last I saw her, she was
headed towards the bathhouse.

Can you please go get her?

The last thing we need is
to be separated right now.

I'm gonna go get some more
supplies

in case anybody else gets hurt.

I don't think a bandaid's
gonna cure

what's more than likely happened
to them.

Our thoughts stay positive,
please.

Stay with her.

I guess I'm gonna get
flashlights.

(Door clatters)

Sorry about the whole crack
whore jab.

has happened to the others out
there.

And what, exactly, is that?

Eh, yeah we're still working
on it.

It attaches itself to the
host and causes severe mutation.


However, without the host
being active,

the parasite can't thrive.

And there's no way to save the
host?

With this severe of a
mutation, I don't think so.

So what happens to the parasite?

(Dramatic, menacing music)
(Parasite screeching)

(Tasha exhales)
(Parasite squishing)

(Distant hissing)

(Eerie, distorted music)

this point, I don't care.

Just help me.

Look at this.


His heart, he was still
changing.

It's filled with puncture
wounds and holes.

Whatever that thing was

was filling him full of
hormones and adrenaline.

That's what the fuck
that as throwing me around

like a rag doll.

Yeah, but there's more to it
than that.

What do you mean?

Well think about it for a
second,


Pumps blood.

It was feeding oxygen
and blood into his body.

Okay.
Well,

what was that thing gunning
toward

What about me?

It also feeds blood into
certain areas of the body.

Oh.

Okay.

Yeah, which is how it spreads,

it takes over the entire
reproductive system,

pumps an excessive amount of
adrenaline,

hormones into the body,

overpowers it's prey and infects
them.

Ew.

So what you're saying is
this thing has a source,

like a patient zero?

I don't know.
