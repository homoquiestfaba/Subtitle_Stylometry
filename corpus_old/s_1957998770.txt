Hey, little Lady.

Hell's coming for breakfast.

Hey, little lady.

Hell's coming for breakfast.

Hey, little lady,
hell is coming for breakfast.

Hey, little lady.

Hell is coming for breakfast.

Hey, little lady.

Hell is coming for breakfast.
I got it.

You've been saying that
for the last forever, Joe.

Am I supposed
to pretend I can't hear?

It's Clint.

I'm sleeping.

So, is it the actual location
that's coming for breakfast

or is hell actually
coming for breakfast?

Like, is it like,
"Get ready, little lady,

Friars Club
is coming for breakfast."

Or is it,
"Hey, little lady,

Walmart is coming
for breakfast,

because I need to know how
many places to set."

You think you're funny,
don't you?

What is that?
Oh, you mean this?

Well, who's coming
for breakfast?

Satan? Hitler?

You love it.

No, please go back

to the bathroom,
shave it off.

Not shaving it off.
It's authentic.

It's my hunting look.
Oh.

Yeah.

Hey, baby.
Hmm?

Authentic is how you walked
into this town.

It looks good on me.

It does look good.

That's right.
It does.

Now, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

-Oh, wow.
-Hold on, hold on.

Honey, why don't you
hop back into bed?

Come on.
I'll do this authentic guy.

Come on. Come on.
I mean it.

Honey, come on, don't be--

Making fun of me. It's fine.

I mean so...

All right,
let's have it.

-This is irresponsible.
-You said that last night.

That's just stupid,
what you're doing.

-You said that too.
-Well, you're being an asshole.

Tess, why are you blowing
this out of proportion?

Tons of guys around here
hunt for their livelihood.

Your dad does it,
Doug does it.

Uh, you're not
from here, Joe.

You sell insurance for a living
and you're really good at it.

Okay, well,
I live here now, so what?

And you're understanding of
here thus far is that mustache?

You haven't hunted
enough with Doug

to go out on your own.

I keep telling you I have
a funny feeling about this

and you just
keep ignoring that.

That was mean.

Yeah, it was.

I'm sorry.

We moved out here to provide
our boys with a safe,

familiar place to grow up
and not to become some...

end of the world
Fox News people.

That's not
what's happening.

It's not
what's happening, Tess.

You have nothing to prove.

I love you...

without the mustache.

But there are
a couple of girls

I can whore you out to
if you want it.

If things get worse,

we need to know
how to do this stuff.

Not that argument
again.

No, why can't--
why can't I say that?

-Why can't I say that?
-Because--

Because I heard it
my whole life.

Okay?

I grew up with these
mountains and my--

my dad prepping
for the end of days.

-That's why I left.
-This is stupid.

-I can't win this argument.
-Oh, you can't? You know why?

Because
it's not about providing,

it's about your ego,
it's about you wanting to

go out with the boys
hunting.

So what? So what?

There's nothing
wrong with that

except for experience
you don't have.

-That's why I'm going out.
-With someone else, Joe.

That's how you learn.
You don't learn alone.

No, you learn by going
out there and doing it.

Right, you just go sit
in the deer stand,

you wait for a deer,
and you shoot it.

Twelve-year-old boys do it.

Why can't I go
out there and try it?

We agreed that we would
learn together as a family.

We would grow
a garden in the spring

and can in the winter.

Go with Doug next week.
That is all I'm asking.

It's not much.

I packed lunch
for the entire day.

And I'm going to go out there
and I'm gonna stay all day.

And I will not be home
until tonight.

Okay.
And if you kill something,

you know
how to disembowel it, right?

Babe, I can't-- I can't.
I'm not doing this.

-I love you.
-I love you.

You better say
goodbye to the boys.

No doubt they heard us.

Love you, buddy.

Hey, little lady,
hell's for breakfast.

You like that?

Mm-hmm.
Will you say it for me?

That's why I'm coming in.

To tell you I love you
and I'll see you tonight.

Okay.

You and Mom fighting?

No, not at all.

You're doing
that whisper thing again.

Well,

sometimes when Mom

and Dads need to have
a conversation,

it's better that
it happens in whispers.

-You like it?
-Mm-hm.

It looks funny.

I love you.

I'll see you tonight.
Me too.

Hey.

Last offer.

Don't do this.

Don't do that. Don't.

-What are you doing?
-Come on.

What are you doing?

Okay, then.
Have fun out there.

You know
what I'll be doing.

What's wrong with you, Joe?

Get a gun, go out,
kill a deer just to go...

Good morning.
Good morning.

Hey.

Can I borrow your--
your rifle?

You ain't get one yet?

Tess, she, uh--

she doesn't want to get
one right now.

It-- it doesn't matter.
Can I just borrow yours?

Ah.

Do you need ammo?
No, I bought some.

-Tess let you get ammo?
-She doesn't know I bought it.

Mmm.
Sorry, sorry.

Got your tags?
Got them in the bag.

You double check 'em?
Yes, Mom.

I ain't your mom.

All right, I know.

Won't be a problem
on the property.

No one can be on it.

But if an officer asks
for your tags on the way back

and you don't have them,
that's trouble.

I got it. Got it.

You remember
how to get to the property?

I believe so.
What else?

I-- I can't think
of anything else.

If you just wait
'til next week, I can go.

Thank you. But I've got
two conferences next week.

-Plus, Tess--
-No, I ain't in your marriage.

Unless you into
some freaky stuff.

Keep it to yourself, then.

Look,
keys are in the car

if you need to borrow it
for any reason, have at it.

I ain't driving
that jerk mobile.

That's nice.

Thanks again.
Mm-hm.

Hey, I'll be sure to bring
that ten point by here

so you can get
that photo op.

Godspeed.

That's your music, right?

You know,
you've got neighbors.

All right, mustache.
Have fun.

Strike one.

One and one is the count.

Joseph Chambers steps
to the mound.

Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs.

1991 World Series.

Strike two.

Too high. Too high.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Can Joe do it tonight?

And he may.

Minnesota.
The talk of the sports world.

Outside.

Strike three!

Joseph Chambers has won

the 1991 World Series.

The Minnesota Twins
are victorious.

Joseph Chambers is an MVP.

He has just beaten
,

ladies and gentlemen.

There was never,
ever any doubt.

We knew
he could pull it off.

And tonight...

We have sat here
and witnessed history.

<i>â™ª I'm the moustache man â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª King of the mountain,</i>
<i>here I stand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the moustache man â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª King of the mountain,</i>
<i>here I stand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the moustache man â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª King of the woods,</i>
<i>yeah, here I stand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the moustache man â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll catch it,</i>
<i>I'll kill it any way I can â™ª</i>

No, no, no.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Oh, no, please no.

Oh, please just wake up.

Oh, please tell me
this isn't happening.

Oh, oh, oh.

I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

Oh, please, God.

Please, please, please,
please, please, oh, please.

Please, I'm so sorry.

Stupid fucking vest.

He's trespassing.

And I'm just standing
my ground, right?

I'm supposed to be
on this property.

He's not supposed to be
on this property.

So...

I did a good thing.

Maybe some little kid
had been on here, right?

What if this guy
was dangerous?

They should thank me
for getting his ass

off of this property
because he was trespassing.

He could be a convict,
he could be dangerous.

He's breaking the law,

and no, it's not my job

to enforce the law
by any means.

I'm not saying that.

What I am saying, though,
is that he is the danger.

And I will just have to
stand my ground.

All right.
Exactly what I'm doing.

Make this go away.

It was an accident.

Of course it's an accident,
you idiot.

You didn't do this
on purpose.

Come on, Joe.
These things happen, okay?

He was on private property.

Private land means
trespassing,

and trespassing means
stand your ground.

You're doing
what's right, okay?

You did
the right thing, Joe.

Okay, okay.

Okay, it's the right thing.

You gotta dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

Dig a hole.

And you gotta put him in it,
do you hear me, Joe?

Go and dig a hole.

You put him in it.
You gonna dig a hole.

I'm so sorry.

Go and dig a hole.
You put him in it.

Dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

Go dig a hole.

Dig a hole
and put him in it.

Dig a hole
and put him in it.

Dig a hole,
put him in it.

Dig a hole,
put him in it.

Dig a hole,
put him in it.

Dig a hole.

Dig a hole.

Dig a hole
and put him in it.

Dig a hole,
put him in it.

Just dig a hole
and put him in it.

No, no, wait.

Wait. Wait, please.
Please don't run away.

Help.
Please don't run away.

Help! Someone!
Hey! Sir! Sir.

No. No, no.
Please wait. Come back.

Somebody help.
No, no.

I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

Help! Help!
No, no, Wait. Wait.

Hold on.
Help!

Please stop running!
Somebody! Help!

No, no, no.
Please stop running.

Sir, hold on. Hold on.
Help! Help!

No, no, no,
please, please, please.

I'm not gonna hurt you.
Help!

No, no,
I'm not gonna hurt you, please.

Help!
Hey! Hey!

Stop, please, please!

No! No, no, ow!

Please stop!

Please stop, please stop.
Stop it, please.

I wanna help you, okay? Ow!

Please! Let me talk.

No, no. Ow!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

No! Hold on.
Just let me explain. Ow!

Stop and let me explain.

Ah! No! Stop it!

God, please. Please stop!

Help!
Please stop!

Listen. Listen. Listen.
Help! Help!

Help! Help!
I'm not gonna hurt you!

I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Please. Please. Please.
Help!

Please, please, ow!
Somebody!

Please stop! Please stop!

Please stop. Please stop.
Please, please, please.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Help, please, someone.

Help me.

Somebody!

Help.

I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

No, I'm not gonna--
Hold on. Let me help you.

I'm just gonna
help you sit up.

Okay? Come on.

Come on. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Stop.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

Okay?
I'm just trying to help.

You shot me.

You're on private property.

You were trespassing.

Private property...

How old are you?

Do you live out here?

I was trying to.

Are you out here alone?

What the fuck?

What the fuck
were you thinking?

Firing off
in the woods like that.

I was chasing a deer.

I didn't mean
to shoot you.

It's my buddy's property.

He lets me
come out here and hunt.

I was following this deer.

Trying to learn
how to be self-reliant

in case things get worse,
you know?

Ah, you're an idiot.

You don't belong out here.

Your type will be
the first to go

when it goes down.

I'm trying, okay?

That's why
I was trying to kill a deer,

so I could clean it.

And I could keep it
in my freezer,

and I can feed my family.

So, I'm trying.

What kind of working freezer
are you gonna put it in

when there's no power?

What?

Does your freezer
magically work in your fantasy?

I guess so.

Small animals...

how you survive.

And wheat.

Edible plants...

You just waste resources
with deer.

I didn't know that.

My buddy, Doug,
has been teaching me how--

Come on.
We got to do something.

No. Don't.
Yeah, let me just--

-let's just try, let's just--
-Don't.

Don't--

don't try.

I'm at least gonna try
to stop the bleeding.

You're a fucking idiot.

No, stop. Don't touch me.

Don't come--
don't touch me.

Stop!
Goddammit, stop it!

Just let me help.
Here. Here. Here.

It's not gonna make any--

Stop.
I'll just put this back here.

Don't-- don't try-- Stop.

Stop it.

Just lean up. Lean up.

Oh, God!

Goddammit, stop.

I'm so sorry.
Stop saying that.

I'm so sorry.

God damn you're pathetic...

I need to get you
to the hospital.

No, you don't.

Look,
I was only digging the hole

'cause I thought
you was dead, okay?

Now that-- if I'd known that
you were alive, I would've--

It wouldn't have made
any difference.

I can't just
leave you out here.

We got to try to get you down
to the truck, come on.

-Man, come on, just--
-If you keep touching me

I'm gonna kill you.

I'm so sorry.

Stop saying that.

Stop saying that.

God, it's pathetic.

You're not gonna
fix anything.

How long
you been living out here?

Doesn't matter.

Seems like you've been
out here for a long time.

Is there somebody
I can call for you?

Yeah.

You pick out them fancy
catalogue clothes yourself?

Or your mommy do it for you?

Oh, God.

Oh, the irony.

Killed by a phony.

Yup.

I'm a big phony.

But I'm at least trying.

That was the whole
point of this.

Oh, God.

I can't just sit here
while you're dying,

so no,
we need to do something.

Just shut up.

My wife didn't want me
to come out here today.

She tried everything
to keep me to stay at home.

I'm just saying,
it seems like

the whole world
is falling apart and it's--

There is no...

...point to surviving.

Just to survive.

There's no point.

Well...

the whole point
of this was...

so I could take care of
my family.

If things got really bad,
I don't--

I don't know how to do anything
but sell insurance.

I just want to--

I just want to be able
to take care of them, you know?

I'm so sorry.
I did not mean--

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Okay.

Okay.

Joe. Joe.

Hey, sexy.

Hey, sweetheart.

Is this your new hunting look,

or you're just trying
to make me regret

being so mean to you
this morning?

I, uh, fell in the river
and decided to strip down

and ride home with the heat on.

I'm sorry,
I'll take you any way I can.

Did you see anything?

No.

-Did you have fun, at least?
-Yeah. It was okay.

Hey, what's wrong?

Nothing.

Just tired and sore
from walking around all day.

Yeah, that can happen.

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>The irony...</i>

<i>Killed by a phony...</i>

Does Doug know you're
keeping the truck overnight?

No, he, uh...

I figured I'd come home,
eat dinner,

maybe drop it by later.

Just didn't want
to show up in my underwear.

-Never live that down.
-That's true.

-Watch out.
-Sorry.

<i>Hey, sexy.</i>

Hey...

You okay?

Sure. I'm fine.

Just need some food in me.

Thank you, Father,
thank you, Father,

for this wonderful food.

Thank you, Father, for Dad
being able to go hunting

and come back safely,

in Jesus' name, amen.

-Amen.
-Amen.

Well, we didn't get a deer,

but we did get Daddy's
favorite meat as back up.

Ribs.

I was actually,
talking to Frank about venison,

about the different ways

you can cut it
and cook it,

and he said that if
you happen to catch a deer,

you should have him
do it this time...

<i>No, help me!</i>

<i>Please!</i>

<i>Joe.</i>

Okay, okay, okay.

He says,
"Pat, well, that's exactly

what I said, and Pat--"

He just kind of
walks up and says,

"No, ma'am,
you said armadillo."

Hey, Joey.

Joe? Hey, are you all right?

Hey, Bonnie, I'm gonna have to
call you back.

Hey, buddy, what's going on?

Are you okay? Are you hurt?

Can you talk to me?

Joe, I'm just gonna have
a quick look at you.

I'm gonna grab you a blanket.

Just wait-- wait right here.

Tessie and the kids?

Joe. Are they hurt?

Okay, all right,
look, I'm just gonna

put this blanket on,
I'll get you--

get youreal-- what?

Okay, all right,
you stay right here.

I'll be right back.

Oh!

Dammit.

We have a situation,
1089, white pickup truck

at the police station
parked right in front.

You can't miss it.

I'm going to need
one of you to come back here.

All right, do me a favor,

set up a perimeter
when you arrive

I'll be inside
questioning the suspect.

God damn it.

I have to cuff you, Joe.

Just 'till we figure out
what's going on, all right?

All right,
we're gonna go in the back,

and have a little chat.

Just step against the wall
to the right.

All right we're gonna go
right to the right here.

All right, I'm gonna
have you sit...

Just sit right here.

Oh, the motion sensors
are on the fritz.

So, I'm gonna wave my arm
around like a jackass.

All right, Joe...

do you think
you can tell me what happened?

Joe, there's a body
in the back of Doug's truck.

Joe.

Can you-- can you tell me
how it got there?

Listen Joe,
I am here for you, all right?

But you have to tell me
what happened.

Come on, Joe.

I just want to see Tess.

yeah.

We can work that out.

Say it.

I just want to see the boys.
Okay.

I can help you.

But you-- you still have to
tell me what's going on.

I need you to tell me
what happened.

Take your time,
there's no rush.

There's no rush, Joe.

There's no rush, huh?

I am here,
so whenever you're ready...
