      Good morning, guys.       
        How's it going?

          Hey, Chewy.           
  Hey, Watson, how's it going?  

     Looking good.              

        Queenie, Rascal.        

             Okay.

Water?

    Holly Garling.              

     Hi.                        
     How are you?               

          Hi. I'm sorry,        
          do we know each other?

      Oh, Seth.                 
      West Brook High.          

  - Oh. Were you in my class?   
  - Oh, I was in the year       
   above you.                   

   We didn't hang out           
   or anything,                 

     but I knew                 
     who you were.              

                 You did?       

Sure, everybody did.            

        I don't know about that.

So you're                       
a writer now, huh?              

That's cool.                    
That's great.                   

            Yeah. This whole    
            waitressing uniform,

           it's just a disguise.

       It's convincing.         

I was gonna order               
an ice cream sundae.            

       - Extra sprinkles.       
       - You wouldn't be        
        the first.              

       - This is my stop.       
       - Oh, this is you?       

               It was nice      
               to see you again.

      Nice to see you too.      
    Hey, if you're not doing    
          anything...           

                ...get a coffee.

   <i> ( muffled music playing )</i>   

         Hmm.                   

   - Man on TV:<i> We're looking</i>   
   <i> </i> at your numbers...         
   - Seth:<i> Hey.</i>                 

There he is.                    
There's the man.                

     - Nate, let me ask you     
      a question.               
     - Hmm?                     

If there was this girl          
and you wanted her              
to notice you...                

           Are you serious      
           right now?           

         Yeah.                  

          Shit, man,            
          I don't know you.     

      I don't know              
      what kind of game you got.
      What are you asking me?   

 Sorry.                         
 I thought maybe...             

             Listen, wait...    
             You like this girl?

  -<i> We are talking</i>              
  <i> </i> about a girl here right?    
  - Yes, girl.                  

     I do like her.             

              So just confident,
              you know?         

            Guy who's confident.
            Knows how to make   
            them laugh.         

       Tell 'em about your day. 
       Act like you give a shit.

             I mean,            
             it ain't a mystery.

   Confident, funny,            
   make 'em laugh.              

    Got it. Good.               
    Thanks.                     

     Hey, and no more bringing  
     this shit to me, all right?

          You and me,           
          we ain't like that.   

        Cool.                   

               ( taps )         

Seth, Dr. Jessup needs          
your help.                      

He's putting down               
the German Shepherd in 34.      

                  Lexi.         

Look, you're a sweet guy.       
But if you can't do your job,   

I'll find someone who can.      

   - Is that clear?             
   - She's a really good dog.   

        <i> Hey, Lexi. Hey.</i>        

       <i> Here's the thing,</i>       
           <i> we just--</i>           

          <i> hey, girl.</i>           

                Hey, Lexi. Hey. 

            How's it going?     
            Wanna go for a walk?

                Hey, hey, hey.  

            Good girl.          
            Yeah, it's exciting,
            isn't it?           

            All right, Lexi.    
            Here we go.         

          All right,            
          that's a good dog.    

        Yeah, that's a good dog.

 - Dr. Jessup:<i> You all right? </i>  
 - Yeah, she's just a good dog. 

           Shh, it's okay, Lexi.
           It's all right.      

You want her,                   
you can always keep her.        

            My building         
            doesn't allow pets. 

               Very strict.     

Fucking find a new place.       

              $9.00 an hour?    
              I'm lucky I have  
              running water.    

That's your whole problem.      
You got no initiative.          

     It's how come you're still 
     working in a shit hole like
     this at your age.          

              You want something
              in this life,     

              you gotta take it.

                  ( sighs )     

          So what's it gonna be?

           I mean, you want her,
           she's yours.         

                Do it,          
                do it already.  

                All right, Lexi.
                Here we go.     

              You're a good dog.

Hold still.                     
You're a good dog.

      if you wanted to get      
      maybe dinner later.       

    I don't know about you,     
      but I love seafood.       

          Oh, you do?

          Hey...                

   - Hi. Anywhere?              
   - Yeah, anywhere is fine.    

                Okay. Thanks.   

Hey, how are you?               
I'm Holly.                      

I'll be taking care             
of you today.                   

           You must be a writer.

       - I'm sorry?             
       - Seth:<i> A writer.</i>        

              The disguise      
              from the bus.     

         We met a couple        
         of days ago on the bus.

       - My name's Seth.        
       - I'm so sorry.          

   My memory, it like           
   totally sucks.               

I know, just what you want      
to hear from your waiter,       
right?                          

             No, that's fine.   

Uh, can I get you               
started with anything?          
An appetizer?                   

                  Yeah, um...   

                 Let's uh--     
                 let's do water.

       And then by the time     
       you come back, I'll know.

      Water.<i> Una agua. </i>         
      You got it.               

              Hey, um,          
              I like your hair. 

              It looks different
              from the bus.     

          - It's nice.          
          - Thank you.          

        Yeah. You shouldn't feel
        insecure about it       

              or self conscious,
              it's--            

              is a good haircut.

Uh. Why don't you               
take a look at the menu         

and I will go grab              
your water.                     

                  Yeah. Pie.

         - Seth.                
         - What's that?         

Seth.                           
My name is Seth.                

           How's the food, Seth?

It's good.                      
It's quality.                   

Actually, I had                 
a question for you.             

Do you like Ben Folds?          

'Cause I have                   
a couple of tickets             
to his concert this week        

and the girl                    
I was gonna go with--           

not a girlfriend                
or anything--                   

she can't make it,              
she has a thing.                

I was wondering                 
if maybe you'd wanna...         

     - go?                      
     - I'm sorry, I can't.      

I don't like going              
to shows by myself,             

it feels kind of strange,       
you know, so maybe...           

Not a big deal, no pressure.    

We could just go.               
It wouldn't have to be          
a date or anything.             

 The thing is, I already        
 sort of have a boyfriend, so...

   No, you don't.               

            I'm just gonna      
            leave this here.    

          Thanks for coming in. 

          Hang on a second.

  and weepy again?              

                   A little bit.

            <i> So the other night</i> 
            <i> with Eric?</i>         

 Really? Are we gonna           
 go there again?                

           He was two years,    
           you can't convince me
           he never mattered.   

                I'm serious,

           Being alone          
           is just kinda shitty.

So, what, I'm just supposed     
to forget everything he did?    

       Yes. Forget, forgive.    
       Move the fuck on already.

         Just go back to the way
         things were.           

You know                        
I can't do that.

                Hey, Sam.       

      - Someone's popular.      
      - What?                   

     We put it                  
     in the break room.         

                     Okay...    

           Lucky, bitch.        
           Spill. Who's the guy?

             - Hey.             
             - Hey.             

  Listen, I'm so sorry          
  for the drunk dial            
  the other night.              

I mean,                         
you know how it is.             

                   Yeah, I do.  

Listen, can I get you           
a beer or something?            

         Eric, you have to stop 
         doing stuff like this. 

     Stuff like...              
     what now?                  

        Come on. Roses? You know
        they're my favorite.    

I didn't know that.             

         Okay. Well,            
         now I just feel stupid.

    - Well-- just one beer.     
    - I should go.              

It wasn't all bad, right?       
We had some good times.         

                     Yep.       

 So why don't we                
 give it another shot?          

          Are you really gonna  
          make me say her name? 

         Eric:<i> This is</i>          
      <i> so fucking stupid.</i>       

            <i> I mean,</i>            
       <i> we had something.</i>       

                    Had.        

              Eric, past tense. 

         I'm gonna get some air.

Seth:                           
Nice night.                     

            - Yeah.             
            - Yep.              

        - Not a smoker?         
        - Me? No.               

                   ( exhales )  
                   That's good. 

          Don't ever start,     
          it's a terrible habit.

    Okay, I won't.              

  Thanks.                       

    - Have a nice night.        
    - You like the flowers?     

You seemed like                 
a red and white roses           
kind of girl.                   

<i> It was just a guess.</i>           

            Oh, my God.         
            You're that guy     
            from the restaurant.

        Seth.                   

      What are you, like,       
      following me or something?

  What? No. Just...             

  Look, I'm not                 
  some psycho, okay?            

  You know me.                  
  We went to school             
  together.                     

               What do you want?

I don't want anything.          
I just want to talk to you.     

When I saw you on the bus       
the other day,                  

after all these years,          
I felt something.               

I know you did.                 

I can't just walk               
away from that.                 

    - I don't even know you.    
    - But you will.             

   - You can go, I just--       
    Can I just talk to you?     
   - No.                        

    - Hey, hang on.             
    - Don't! Don't touch me.    

      Move!                     
      Are you kidding me?       

             Seth:              
    Just let me talk to you.    

   Fuck you. Fuck you!          

     - Just let me explain.     
     - Eric:<i> What the fuck?</i>     

     - He tried to grab me.     
     - Seth:<i> What? No.</i>          

               Hey, that is not 
               true at all, man.

       ( grunts )               
       Fuck off.                

                 ( whimpers )   

       - Did he hurt you?       
       - I'm fine.              

   - ( chuckles )               
   - You think this is funny?   

          Eric, stop.           
          Stop it.              

   - Stop it.                   
   - Laugh it up, dick head.    

             Let me handle this.

       - Hey. ( strains )       
       - Come on.               

Get the fuck away               
from her.                       

            Don't you           
            ever come back here.

        ( groans )              

    ( coughs )                  

            Maybe if you retrace
            your steps.         

   No. It's gotta be            
   here somewhere.              

      Well, was your name in it?

           Or like any          
           contact information? 

  What do you think?

              Shh.              

  What I just put in you        
  is called pancuronium bromide.

It's a paralyzing agent.        
It stings a little.

           It's hard for me too.

    But it's important to define
    our relationship.           

     Establish some boundaries. 

            This.               
            This doesn't work.  

That's right.

a gun, Holly.

          a choice.

             I might not be able

What is this,                   
some kind of fucking

Did God tell you                
to punish all the whores,       
something like that?            

                It's a different
                kind of saving. 

     - And, no.                 
     - So what, you're just     
      a sick fuck?              

This is how you get             
your kicks?                     

              I'm not doing this
              for me.           

                I'm doing this  
                for you.        

         Because you're special.

  Special?                      

                   It's true.   

             Before I met you,  
             I was just floating

                through life.   

         Like any minute,       
         I could just drift off.

                No one would    
                even notice.    

            Then you came along.

              And the thing--   

          the thing that made it
          so hard is,           

            is I thought        
            you were different. 

            You're smart. Funny.

          When you talked to me,
          you saw me,           

            you really saw me.  

          That's just what you  
          wanted me to see, huh?

    The version of Holly you are
    when everyone's watching.   

        <i> But we both know</i>       
        <i> that's a lie, don't we?</i>

      Go to hell.               

         That's the question.   

             <i> Which one's</i>       
             <i> the real Holly?</i>   

       <i> The Holly on the outside</i>
       <i> or the other Holly.</i>     

   Because if there's           
   even a chance I can save you,

           I have to take it.   

          <i> But if that's it,</i>    
          <i> if there's nothing</i>   
          <i> left to save,</i>        

          <i> then you're never</i>

  They won't catch me,          
  I'm not going in there.       

                Just grab a mop.

      We got that place smellin'
      like dog shit out there.  

        Shit.                   

        ( door rattles )        

   This fuckin' dude            
   is a joke.                   

Claire:<i> So...</i>                   

what are you                    
gonna do now?                   

                I'm gonna wait. 

            Claire:             
          <i> Good girl.</i>           

             Seth:              
   <i> It's a real page-turner.</i>    

  <i> You're a hell of a writer,</i>   
        <i> you know that?</i>         

            You're a thief.     

            And now what?       

          Suddenly, you got me  
          all figured out.      

     I wish. No.                

  Mostly I just felt            
  sorry for you.                

         You? Felt sorry for me?

Yeah, it's the part             
where you talk about love.      

  "Love is just a label         

  for our biological            
  imperatives."                 

  I don't know.                 
  Felt ignorant to me.          

       Are you really gonna     
       lecture me on love, Seth?

        You're keeping a girl   
        in a cage.              

 I think I finally              
 figured it out.                

 All these people               
 who talk about love            

    like it's this              
    lightning bolt from the sky.

        This irresistible force.

          So you think, well,   
          I've never felt that. 

            <i> But those people</i>   
            <i> are wrong.</i>         

            Love is not         
            a lightning bolt.   

Love is, real love,             

      takes work.               

      Sacrifice.                

   Real love is giving          
   everything you have          
   to someone else.             

     - That's love.             
     - Fucking kidding me?      

     You don't think?           

            "Love is sacrifice"?

     You know who believes that?
     People who hate themselves.

      <i> Who are alone, depressed.</i>
      <i> Just like you.</i>           

   - You think I have myself?   
   -<i> I know you do.</i>             

      You hate yourself so much,
      you can't even imagine    

           how fucked up someone
           would have to be     
           to love you back.    

      <i> So you convince yourself</i> 
      <i> that love is this thing</i>  
      <i> that you can buy.</i>        

          That all you have     
          to do is keep giving. 

 Well, like I said,             
 I just feel sorry for you.     

           Spare me             
           the fucking pity,    

           I'm not the one      
           who's alone here.    

   Oh, I guess not.             

And how is Claire               
these days?                     

     What are you talking about?

You know, sometimes             
before I open that door,        

      I can heard you           
      talking in here           

      <i> to Claire.</i>               

     <i> The way you do</i>            
     <i> two voices</i>                

   <i> scared the hell</i>             
   <i> out of me at first.</i>         

      You don't know            
      what you're talking about.

      I know more               
      than you think.           

  <i> Is she here, right now?</i>      

            No.                 

              She's not real.   

    You don't think             
    I know that?                

     I think you're             
     starting to forget         

              Don't get paranoid
              on me, Eric.      

You're no fun                   
when you're paranoid.           

             Seth:              
      <i> You're sick, Holly.</i>      

     <i> Feeding that sickness</i>     
   <i> until all it does is eat.</i>   

 You just have it all           
 figured out, don't you?        

                  Almost.       

       One thing                
       I still don't understand.

             The journal.       

     <i> ( car engine roars )</i>      

      First, I get it.          
      You and Eric getting      
      engaged.                  

  Blah, blah, blah.             

But here comes                  
your best friend, Claire.       
The real Claire.                

( imitates dramatic music )     

              Holly can't eat.  
              Holly can't sleep.

    Holly wants to confront them
    but Holly's too scared.     

                  Fuck you.     

  Then here.                    
  Here's where it gets          
  really interesting.           

            Claire:             
          <i> I get home</i>           
       <i> and there's like</i>        

          <i> 20 messages</i>          
      <i> from Dwayne, right?</i>      

          <i> He's like,</i>           
        <i> "Where are you?</i>        

        <i> Why haven't you</i>        
      <i> picked me up yet?"</i>       

         <i> Even though,</i>          
     <i> he's the one who said</i>     

          that he was coming    
          to get me on Saturday.

             You know,          
             somehow of course  

             it's just magically
             my fault.          

   Were you going               
   to tell me?                  

               Tell you what?   

   Come on, Claire.             
   You know.                    

               Um, not really.  

        Eric.                   

        ( tires squeal )        

             How'd you find out?

 His email.                     
 He doesn't know                
 I have the password.           

            - Shit              
            - Yeah.             

            Holly, what do you  
            want me to say?     

            You know, I'm sorry.

            We were so drunk.   
            And it didn't mean  
            anything.           

Oh, well, as long               
as it didn't mean anything.     

       Okay, Holly,             
       please slow the car down.

You're unbelievable.            

      ( tire screeching )       

      - Do you know that?       
      - I'm sorry.              

         You have no idea       
         how shitty I feel      
         about this whole thing.

     And if it-- damn it, please
     slow the car down, okay?   

You're supposed to be           
my best fucking friend.         

             Holly, come on.    
             Jesus.             

     - ( car horn blaring )     
     - ( tires screeching )     

         Holly! God damn it,    
         you're gonna kill us.  

     - ( car horn blaring )     
     - ( tires screeching )     

          ( crashing )          

           Boom.                

        ( groans )              

    Oh, my God.                 
    Oh, my fucking God.         

                 <i> We're okay.</i>   
                 <i> I'm all right.</i>

       -<i> We're gonna</i>            
       <i> </i> be okay, Holly.        
       - ( gasps )              

      <i> We're okay, Holly.</i>       

      We're gonna be fine.      

      We're gonna be okay.      

      I'm gonna be fine.        

              And you think     
              that's what?      

             A confession?      
             I'm a writer, Seth.

             <i> Fiction's</i>         
             <i> kind of what I do.</i>

          ( laughing )          

             Seth:              
    <i> That's why I didn't go</i>     
    <i> straight to the police.</i>    

       <i> I had to be sure.</i>       

   <i> I thought I'd follow you</i>    
    <i> around for a few days,</i>     

    <i> but you didn't make me</i>     
          <i> wait long.</i>           

          ( gasping )           

  -<i> ( glass shattering ) </i>       
  - Seth:<i> It was a risky move.</i>  

     - Homeless man:<i> No! </i>       
     - Seth:<i> Even for you.</i>      

  -<i> ( Homeless man screams ) </i>   
  -<i> ( fire erupts )</i>             

    ( screaming )               

             Seth:              
      <i> There were so many.</i>      

   You want to know             
   what I think?                

   I think you wanted           
   to get caught.               

  That's why you kept           
  the journal.                  

  <i> You wanted</i>                   
  <i> to get punished.</i>             

         Lucky you came along . 

  You don't get it,             
  do you?                       

<i> This isn't punishment.</i>         

      I'm trying                
      to save you.              

           Then do it.          

            Save me.            

       I will.                  

       I will.                  

<i> I meant what I said.</i>           

<i> I'm gonna stop you</i>             
<i> hurting other people.</i>          

           One way or the other.

                 And the Oscar  
                 goes to...     

      He wants to save me.      

       I have to let him        
    think there's a chance.     

         So that was all an act?

                <i> You were just</i>  
                <i> humoring him?</i>  

     -<i> Playing along... </i>        
     - If you've got            
      something to say...       

  I'm just making sure          
  your head's still in the game.

      I don't need another      
   useless pep talk, Claire.    

     And I don't need you.      

              Yes?              

         What?                  
         No. Nothing.           

<i> Just was curious.</i>              

   Why you did it.              

          I guess, when I saw   
          Eric's email,         

          all those messages    
          from Claire--         

No, not Claire.                 
I understand that.              

It's a crime of passion         
or whatever.                    

I wanna know why                
you didn't stop there.          

<i> Why you killed the others.</i>     

'Cause you feel guilty          
for what you did to Claire,     

   for getting away with it.    

<i> You wanted to get caught,</i>      
<i> didn't you?</i>                    

            No, because I could.

Yeah, I don't believe that.     

             Well, I don't care 
             what you believe.  

<i> 'Cause see,</i>                    
<i> here's the thing, Seth.</i>        

<i> When someone dies</i>              
<i> in front of you,</i>               
<i> the way Claire died,</i>           

it's like you're whole world    
just snaps into focus.          

               Cry for help?    

   It was a way                 
   to pass the time.            

   Don't pretend                
   you know what I am.          

                 You're wrong,  
                 I do know you. 

           I know you from this.

             And the girl       
             who wrote this,    
             you had dreams.    

         She cared about people.

      <i> Who's scared to be alone.</i>

         This is the real you.  

                  Not...        

Seth's got a little crush.      

            This isn't about us.

If you love something,          
set it free.                    

           Isn't that           
         how that goes?         

               <i> You know</i>        
               <i> I can't do that.</i>

        Do you know what happens
        to a great white shark  

        when you put him        
      inside an aquarium?       

      It bashes its brains      
       against the glass.       

          Every time.           

Come on.                        

      - ( smacks )              
      - Stop, Holly, stop!      

Stop, Holly!                    

           What are you gonna do
           when you come down   
           here tomorrow        

           and I'm belly up     
           in the tank, huh?    

               <i> 'Cause you can't</i>
               <i> just walk away.</i> 

     Not with your finger prints
     all over the place.        

         I kill myself,         
         your life ends too.    

         So how's that          
         for the boundaries     

          of our fucking        
          relationship?         

    <i> ( door opens, closes )</i>     

       <i> ( dogs barking )</i>        

          ( humming )           

            - Seth?             
            - Hmm?              

     Finish this up             
     and come see me            
     in my office.              

  Something wrong?              

           "Is something wrong?"
           That's the question, 
           isn't it?            

 I'm not following you.         

        <i> The kennels are filthy.</i>

           <i> We've got bugs up</i>   
           <i> in the stock room.</i>  

            And where's Seth?   
            He's not here,      
            that's for sure.    

          Nate says you haven't 
          been here in two days.

   Mrs. Gundy,                  
   Nate is hardly--             

            Nate does his job.  

      <i> You should've done yours.</i>

  You're firing me?             

            Disciplinary notice.

            This goes in your   
            permanent record.   

            One more strike     
            and you're gone.    
            Understand?         

     Understood.                
     Thank you.                 

You don't know how much         
this means to me.               

     <i> This, this is what's</i>      
      <i> gonna happen to you</i>      

         when you think         
       you're in control.       

        You think you're        
       in control, Holly.       

  Well, this is what'll happen  
   when you think you're in--   

  -<i> I control the situation. </i>   
  -<i> ( whispers echoing )</i>        

       <i> There's the man.</i>        
 <i> Just doing some maintenance.</i>  

      Didn't ask.               

            Hey, Seth.          
            I got your paycheck.

              Still here, huh?  

        Where's the rest?       

           There is no rest.    

         This is what happens   
         when you start acting  
         like you're in control.

    That's not enough.          

    You don't get               
    to decide that.             

                  Fuck you.     

 Fuck me?                       
 I go through hell              
 for you                        

 and what do you do,            
 threaten me?                   

 <i> You ever pull</i>                 
 <i> that shit again,</i>              

I'll show you what              
a real hunger strike feels like.

      Fuck you.                 

        I had a dream last night
        and you were in it.     

             It was just        
             the two of us.     

       And we were in this house
       down by the water.       

       And I think we'd been    
       living there a long time 

       'cause there were these  
       pictures on the walls.   

            Pictures of us.     

            It was weird        
            looking at them,    

          because something     
          about it felt right.  

            Like this,          
            this whole world    
            is a dream          

    and that house on the beach,
    that's reality.             

         That's how things      
         are supposed to be.    

             Seth:              
      <i> Maybe I can get you</i>      
          <i> some snacks</i>          

   <i> from the vending machine.</i>   

         Thanks, Seth.          

        <i> ( door closes )</i>        

       Holy shit.               

              There's a light   
              on the wall.      

          Hey, what's your name?

         Um, I'm Nate.          

             Listen to me, Nate.

      You have to find something
      to break open this lock.  

                Can you do that?

   What kind of fucked up...    

    - Did Seth do this?         
    - Nate, there's no time     
     for that right now.        

            Okay, go at it hard,
            at an angle.        

We gotta call somebody,         
the cops or whatever.           

          You have to get me    
          out of here right now.

       <i> ( Nate and Holly</i>        
      <i> faintly murmuring )</i>      

             Holly:             
     <i> Keep going, try now.</i>      

             Nate:              
    <i> That's what I'm doing.</i>     

     - Holly:<i> No, just... </i>      
     -<i> ( banging )</i>

             Nate:              
    <i> This is all fucked up.</i>     

             Okay, that's great.

             Nate:              
        <i> Okay, on three.</i>        
          <i> All right?</i>           

       <i> One, two, three.</i>        

         ( straining )          

  ( panting )                   
  Hold on.                      

        Do you know             
        what real love is, Nate?

       - What?                  
       - Holly:<i> You know,</i>       
       <i> </i> real love.             

    <i> Say you loved somebody.</i>    
       <i> But she got sick.</i>       

       <i> And then someone</i>        
      <i> came along one day</i>       

    <i> to pull the plug on her</i>    

             to take her away   
             from you forever.  

             What would you do? 

             Nate:              
  <i> I don't know, I just wanna</i>   
      <i> get you outta here.</i>      

             Holly:             
     <i> You would do anything</i>     

         <i> to stop that</i>          
        <i> from happening.</i>        

      Anything at all, no matter
      what the cost             

              because that's    
              what love is.     

              Love is sacrifice.

        - ( smacks )            
        - What the fuck?        

            You die.            

                   Oh.          

      Are you stabbing me?      

                     ( screams )

         Motherfucker!          

The block, Seth.                
Use the cinder block.           

    He's moving.                
    Come on, use it.            

         - I can't.             
         - You have to.         

    Seth, I can't lose you.     

       -<i> Please? </i>               
       - Nate:<i> Oh, fuck.</i>        

       <i> ( Nate screams )</i>        

      <i> I can feel my leg.</i>       
          <i> ( screams )</i>          

      What the fuck?            

       <i> Somebody help me.</i>       
          <i> ( groans )</i>           

         - Oh, my--             
         - ( crashes )          

Come on, do it again.           

      One more time.            

           I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.           

Seth. You have                  
to listen to me, okay?          

<i> You have to do</i>                 
<i> exactly what I say.</i>            

<i> Are you listening?</i>             

Okay, step one                  
is disposing of the body.       

The sooner, the better.         

<i> Okay, burn it, bury it,</i>        
<i> sink it, whatever.</i>             

<i> Just get it out of here.</i>       

<i> But you can't do that</i>          

<i> before you get rid</i>             
<i> of the identifiers.</i>            

<i> Teeth, tattoos,</i>                
<i> fingerprints.</i>                  

<i> The fingerprints are easy,</i>     
<i> you can use a carob for that.</i>  

       <i> After the teeth,</i>        
   <i> you need to scatter them.</i>   

          <i> Dumpsters,</i>           
      <i> in water, whatever.</i>      

         <i> Just not all</i>          
      <i> in the same place.</i>       

        And then there's        
 just the body to worry about.  

             Seth:              
      <i> He's not gonna fit</i>       
      <i> in the incinerator.</i>      

             Holly:             
     <i> Well, not like that.</i>      

        ( fire erupts )         

             Holly:             
    <i> Do you want to practice</i>    
     <i> with me what to say?</i>      

             Seth:              
       <i> Hey, Mrs. Gundy,</i>        
          <i> it's Seth.</i>           

  <i> Sorry to call you so late.</i>   

       Um, yeah, Nate asked me  
       to watch the front       

    while he ran some errands   
    and he's still not back yet.

         <i> I don't know</i>          
        <i> where he went.</i>         

              Oh...             
              Okay, good night. 

             Sorry.             

     How do you feel?           

            I don't know.       
            Disconnected.       

      Like it happened          
      to someone else, you know?

  The first time's              
  always the worst.             

      There is no<i> first</i> time.   
      It was an accident.       

     - I told you.              
     - You know what always     
      got to me?                

    It was the questions.       

    I remember                  
    in the beginning            

  all I could think about       
  was what if she had a pet?    

  <i> It's poor little doggie</i>      
  <i> just sitting by the door</i>     

        <i> waiting for her</i>        
         <i> to come home.</i>         

    But all that goes away.     

       The more you think       
            about it            

     the more you remember      
   the parts that you liked.    

     How it made you feel.      

   <i> Like you were in control</i>    
         <i> of your life</i>          

   <i> for the very first time,</i>    
 <i> like nothing could hurt you.</i>  

     That's not how it was.     

But the only problem is         

that sooner or later            
it all goes back to normal.     

All of a sudden                 
you're nothing special,         
you're just you.                

          Stop, okay?           

 Holly:                         
<i> And that's when you</i>            
<i> start to wonder.</i>               

How far you'd have to go        
to get that feeling back.       

       It's not the same.       

There is no shame in accepting  
what you are, Seth.             

             I did it,          
             to keep us safe.   

             I had no choice.   

 Didn't you ever wonder why     

all the girls in the world      
but you get a hard on for me?   

<i> And you think that's, what,</i>    
<i> a coincidence?</i>                 

You and me,                     
we were born to do this.        

       Don't act like you know  
       a goddamn thing about me.

I know that a normal person     
finds a murder confession       

and goes to the police.         

   not to PetSmart.             

          Oh, yeah,             
          "Excuse me, Officer.  

       You see that girl        
       over there, the waitress?
       She's Hannibal Lecter.   

    <i> You know how I know?</i>       
    <i> I broke into her apartment</i> 
    <i> and stole her shit."</i>       

          <i> Think that'll work?</i>  

   Oh, and so plan B            
   is kidnapping?               

             'Cause the fucking 
             alternative        

             was sitting around 
             watching you hurt  
             someone else.      

         Mm.                    

    Good thing                  
    no one got hurt.            

                 I told you...  
                 I told you.    

               It's an accident.

     Face it, Seth.             

    This was never              
    about saving lives,         
    you like this.              

    You like having             
    that kind of power.         

<i> Deciding who lives,</i>            
<i> who dies.</i>                      

       Holly, it's not too late.

         I can save you, please.

                Please.         
                I can save you. 

Maybe you're not                
supposed to save me.            

  Maybe I'm suppose             
  to save you.                  

                  Don't, don't. 

Seth, please help me,           
I'm so cold.                    

Please make me warm.            

Can you help me,                
can you please make me warm?    

         ( moans )              

I thought you love me.          

                  I do.         

              I do love you.    

                Holly. Holly.   

                 Holly.         

        I'll come back          
        as soon as I can.       

            - Oh.               
            - Seth.             

    This is Detective Mira.     

    Something wrong?            

           Detective:           
      <i> Is there somewhere</i>       
         <i> we can talk?</i>          

   So, you work                 
   with Nathan, yeah?           

                      Yes.      

When's the last time            
you saw him?                    

          Wednesday, I think?   
          Wednesday evening.    

          Yeah, he asked me     
          to cover the front    

                   while he ran 
                   some errands.

    - What kind of errands?     
    - Um, he didn't say.        

    Uh-huh. And this            
    would be about...           

       what time?               

           9:00, 10:00.         
           Something like that. 

He leave out                    
through the front?              

                  Yeah.         

The front door,                 
you sure?                       

                Yeah, why?      

Well, here's the thing.         

The front door operates         
on a keyless entry system.      

As you know, it records         
each instance in or out.        

Now you wanna guess             
the last time someone           
opened that door?               

4:00.                           
That's 4:00 AM.                 

  - Huh.                        
  -<i> And you said it was what,</i>   
  <i> </i> 9:00 or 10:00PM?            

It's kind of weird,             
don't you think?                

              No, maybe         
              I'm remembering   
              it wrong.         

              He could have left
              out the side door,
              or loading docks. 

   Loading docks?               
   Oh, sure. Yeah.              

        I should check that out.

You and Nathan friends?         

       Well, we worked together.
      He was a nice guy and all.

   Until he tried               
   to get you fired.            

      What? Oh.                 
      That is not what happened.

                Nate and I      
                were friends.   

Oh, now                         
you're friends again.           

Or you were friends,            
past tense.                     

That's the second time          
you said that.                  

   Well, you know               
   what they say.               

First time 's confusion,        
second time's confession.       

              What's this about?

Standard procedure.             

So now, he asked you            
to cover for him,               

this is what Wednesday night,   
nine or ten?                    

Did he say                      
where he was going?             

             I think he had     
             to meet someone.   

            He got a phone call,
            something.          

It's funny, because             
the first thing we did          

was check                       
the phone records.              

And the last person he          
talked to was his girlfriend.   

  5:32 that afternoon.          

                         Hi.    

            Gotta eat something.

                <i> Holly, come on.</i>

        <i> Come on.</i>               
        <i> Come on, don't do this.</i>

             Seth:              
        <i> Now I know what</i>        
         <i> you're doing.</i>         

     <i> It's not gonna work.</i>      

   <i> Just talk to me, please.</i>    

                Holly:          
               <i> It's over, Seth.</i>

I don't understand.             

              <i> Because if you</i>   
              <i> can't help me</i>    

   if you can't give me         
   what I need, then no one can.

   Tell me,                     
   tell me what you need.       

            You know the answer.

            You put me in a box.

              That's not love,  
              that's ownership. 

             <i> You didn't</i>        
             <i> give me anything.</i> 

          <i> All you did was take.</i>

I can't let you out.            

     -<i> You know that. </i>          
     - I didn't ask you to.     

Then what?                      
What do you want?               

                      Proof.    

        Proof?                  

          - A finger.           
          - A what?             

      A finger?                 

      My finger?                

        No.                     

  <i> No. No. No. No.</i>              

   This is fucked.              

  Can't you see that?           

This is totally fucked.         

   No. I'm trying               
   to save you here.            

                 And I'm trying 
                 to let you.    

<i> Well, you can't</i>                
<i> ask me for that, Holly.</i>        

<i> And I'm not gonna do it.</i>       

          I used to think       
          I was the only one.   

          Even when I was a kid,
          I still knew.         

              That if they      
              ever found out,   

              my family,        
              my friends...     

 If they knew what I really was,
 they'd run the other way.      

          And so you learn to...

           blend in, to fake it.

               <i> After a while,</i>  

     <i> you don't even notice</i>     
     <i> how lonely you really are.</i>

                   But then...  

            someone comes along,

             someone like you.  

           Even if he just      
           doesn't know it yet. 

           And all of a sudden, 

           you start thinking,  

           maybe it doesn't     
           have to be this way. 

             <i> Maybe I don't</i>     
             <i> have to be alone.</i> 

               And so let go    
               of the rope.     

    Because this person,        
    he's not gonna let you fall.

          <i> He's gonna catch you.</i>
          <i> You know it.</i>         

        At least that's what you
        keep telling yourself.  

            The whole way down. 

             Don't come back.   

               If that's all    
               I am to you,     

             if I'm just a pet. 

              Then don't        
              come back for me. 

        <i> Don't come back for me.</i>

       <i> ( dogs whining )</i>        

          If I do this          
          for you,              

      then you'll believe?      

          Yes.                  

          This is wrong.        

Seth, you love me.              

 There is nothing               
 more right than that.          

           ( groans )           

          ( whimpers )          

You're almost there.            

               ( screams )      

              ( crunches )      

    ( screaming continues )     

Open the door.                  

    - What are you doing?       
    - Open the fucking door.    

You're already down             
a finger, Seth.                 

How much more                   
are you ready to lose?          

              ( groans )        

       Get back.                

                 Holly.         

           Wait.                
           What are you doing?  

          Shh.                  

    I believe you.              

                 You do?        

                 Do you...      

You saved me, Seth.             

     Of course                  
     I love you.                

    But you know                
    what that means.            

     ( choking, gargling )      

                <i> ( Seth gasps )</i> 
                <i> Holly.</i>         

                <i> Don't leave me.</i>

          ( panting )           

    Oh, God.                    

    ( moans )                   

             Eric:              
      <i> You've been working</i>      
  <i> on these pieces for years.</i>   

             Holly:             
    <i> I know, I'm not saying</i>     
       <i> I'm not excited.</i>        

It's like great                 
to get that call.               

   - I just--                   
   - I figured you'd be more    
    psyched about this.         

<i> It's a big deal,</i>               
<i> getting published.</i>             

       It's just a vanity press,
       it's not exactly "The New
       Yorker."                 

             Screw that,        
             it's still awesome.

              <i> I'm proud of you.</i>

      I thought you didn't      
      even like my story.       

              I like you.       

       <i> ( phone buzzes )</i>        

    - Hey, babe,                
     can you grab my phone?     
    - Yeah.                     

       <i> ( man chattering</i>        
            <i> on TV )</i>            

      Here you go.              

                Thank you, babe.

             Hi.                

    ( sighs )                   
    I had another               
    bad day with Eric.          

<i> He's still fooling around</i>      
<i> with other girls.</i>              

<i> This morning</i>                   
<i> I almost hurt him.</i>             

But then I thought of you.      

And how much                    
you love me.                    

And what you're doing           
for me.                         

Then I felt better.
