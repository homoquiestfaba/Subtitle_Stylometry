Okay.

You can come in.

I'm sorry, I was just sound
checking the microphone here.

You guys must be all set.
Has he eaten?

Yes. Okay.

If he needs to go
to the bathroom,

do I just wave
my hands at someone?

Let me just finish
setting this up

and then I'll explain
what's going on.

Mark, he was only 19 years old

and he didn't understand
a lot of things.

DeFriest cap letter Mike dash.

D-E-F-R-I-E-S-T.

Cap interview--

His dad died
and evidently the dad

had told him that he could
have certain tools.

Had told him that he could
have certain tools.

No. Apparently Mark
didn't understand

about probate,
and he took the tools

and then his stepmother
called the police

and had him arrested for that.

He was in there for
four years for taking,

well, not even taking
his father's tools.

Well, not even taking
his father's tools.

Okay.

I don't know if you remember me.

We met back in 1981.

I was a lot younger then.

I remember you.

Are you okay talking with me?

Sure.

Okay.

And you really think all
this going to help, huh?

I suspect that I may be able to
make your life a lot better.

You know, if I was just a rapist

or a murderer or something,
they'd let me out.

I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

He became Houdini.
So he could escape.

He could take a piece of paper

and make a key out of it.

He'd get out of anything.

Mark DeFriest.
Yeah, that's who it was.

Mark DeFriest.
Yeah, that's who it was.

He's smarter than
all the rest of them

that's in there.
That creates a problem

because they're scared of him.

He was in the worst wing.

Lived in total darkness
in a small cell.

No electricity.
His water had been cut off.

There were stabbings,
murder, and mayhem.

There were stabbings,
murder, and mayhem.

Someone who came
into the prison system

having never committed a
violent crime of any type.

I don't think
they'll ever let him out.

Mark DeFriest's entire
history should be examined.

Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

Now, you see, that thing,

Now, you see, that thing,

that's a real
fighting machine there.

That's that fast shooting one.

Spitting out thousands
of rounds a minute.

If you had Mark here,
we could get that going

in a couple weeks easily.

This wrench right here
belonged to Mark DeFriest.

And we worked on a Lark with it

down at Apalachicola.

Down at Apalachicola.

He was doing something
all the time.

And he was a whiz
at mechanicing everything.

That's Mark.

There he is right there
up here on the Lark.

I believe that's Brenda.

I believe that's
his wife right there.

This was in '79.

I was working at a restaurant.

Mark and his father
were in Chattahoochee

doing some work on that bridge.

They were doing some
welding on the bridge.

They were doing some
welding on the bridge.

He was blonde,
blue eyes, young, funny.

I guess that was what attracted
me to him at the time.

At that point we were married.

His truck, the love of his life.

His truck, the love of his life.

The back of it was like
a traveling garage.

It was immaculate.

His tools were as-- you
could eat off his tools,

they were so clean.

We traveled out west,
and the way he paid for it

was vehicles broken down
along the road

all the way along,
and he would stop

and he would help those people
and then they would pay.

I mean, he could
fix anything. Anything.

It feels like that was the best
time of your life in a way.

Yeah, it was fun.

Yeah, it was fun.

Yeah, it was cool.

Could it have kept going?

I don't see why not.

My dad died and that's
what screwed it up.

I went down to Florida.

I should have stayed the
fuck away from that place.

I can't remember how he
found out about his father

being in the hospital because
we did make it to the hospital

before his father died.
But when we were going

to go see his father again,
we found out he was dead.

No one had told him
his dad was dead.

His dad died, and it appeared
that he was here, around here.

His dad died, and it appeared
that he was here, around here.

And evidently
the dad had told him

that he could have
certain tools and stuff.

I knew he wanted me
to have all his tools

and stuff from a shop he had
from a joint business

we used to do,
and I picked the stuff up

before the will was probated,
because it was my understanding

that the tools and stuff
would go to me

and all the insurance policies
and money went to my stepmother.

He was only 19 years old
and he didn't understand.

He was only 19 years old
and he didn't understand

about probate.

And they took the tools
and then his stepmother

called the police and had
him arrested for that.

They come to pick him up
and the sheriff

told me his self, and I
think he told Cooper, too--

I was, you know he said--

See, the sheriff
come to pick him up

and he just wanted
to talk to them

about the situation, see?

But Mark broke
and run from the trailer.

But Mark broke
and run from the trailer

and it all started from there.

Just where they captured him at,

I don't remember and everything.

He had four years
and that whole situation

sucked because he was
in there for four years

for taking, well, not even
taking his father's tools.

The Florida Division
of Corrections

protects the public.

Society rightfully expects that.

At the same time, it's committed
to help the people

within these walls return
to society as valuable citizens.

That commitment requires
a staff with special skills.

Thoroughly trained,
dedicated people.

Thoroughly trained,
dedicated people

who look forward to expanding
the correctional horizons.

I went to visit him
every weekend.

It was only about five
miles across the bridge.

I'm not using to being
around those kind of people,

and I hate to be stereotypical,
but you know what kind of people

are usually in prison,
and you know what kind

of people usually visit them,
and I felt way out

of people usually visit them,
and I felt way out

of my league there.
Not that I'm better

than anybody,
but I am better than that.

All of a sudden I'm around a
bunch of these fucking idiots

that think
they're fucking Einstein

of criminal behavior
and whatever.

Think they're real
dangerous people.

And you got guards
trying to seduce you,

you know, saying
if you'll have sex with me

I'll pull a favor for Mark,
or stuff like that.

It's a nasty world.

Four years, wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

Four years, wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

Have a nice day.

How am I supposed to feel?

How would you feel?

Go, go, go!

Another guy, half of them
got hung up on a fence

on the razor wire shit,
he was screaming,

"DeFriest, wait up for me!"

I'm, like, what the fuck
is wrong with you people, man?

There's an art to everything.

My dad taught me how to deal
with stuff like that.

So he taught you
how to cheat razor wire?

Well, not that
particular brand of it,

but, I mean,
infiltration is part

but, I mean,
infiltration is part

of fucking
military training, man.

Sabotage
and counterintelligence.

That's all stuff you learned?

Yeah.

It's part of war.

I was trained from age six

guerilla warfare,
guns, explosives,

bombs, anti-tank rockets.

My father, he was in the
OSS during World War II.

He was into that whole
fifties and sixties thing

about the fucking Reds
were coming and shit.

Now, that was really a whole
culture thing back then.

That fucking dude was nuts.

He really was.

I never saw a Russian yet.

We went to one of
my old friend's house.

They had a Ford pickup truck.

They had a Ford pickup truck.

Hotwired the truck, we back
out, voom, and took off.

We was in Tallahassee
and then we got caught

in that fucking motel and
all that other bullshit.

It turned into the crime
of the century.

You know me, just one
problem after the next.

He even said to me,
when he was in ACI.

He even said to me,
when he was in ACI

before he escaped,
you know, you should

move on because
when I get out of here,

I'm going to be
so screwed up in the head

it's not even going to be
worth your time,

and he was right.

Because, you know,
he said he was being,

I guess, raped in the prison,

and he was having to fight
because, you know,

blonde and blue eyes
in prison, not good.

Yeah, so they sent me
to the nuthouse

for a psychological evaluation.

They thought you were crazy?

Yeah. Why?

I have no idea. Do I seem crazy?

Can we have an honest opinion

from the peanut gallery?

Do I seem crazy?

The Florida State Hospital
Forensic Services,

a secure facility with mental
health treatment inside.

People are committed
by the criminal courts

from all over the state
of Florida to the hospital.

This is our carpentry
vocational training program.

This is our carpentry
vocational training program

here at Florida State Hospital.

This is one of our six
vocational training areas.

We have educational programs
from preschool

through junior college.

Students seem to like it
because of the immediate

response that they get.

Yeah.

I was quite young
when I started there.

I think I was about 29.

I found that the people
I worked with

on the wards were local people

who that was the economy there.

And I always said if there were

a meat-processing factory,
they'd all be processing meat.

I worked there at the time.

That sucked.

Because I was
a social worker there

and I had patients that
were looking up to me

as their social worker
and then I was trying to help

and give them advice
and I've got this husband

over there in Forensic Services.

He made these recently.

He made these chairs.

He cut the strips
from the inside lining

of potato chip bags.

That's what
this metallic foil is.

That's what
this metallic foil is.

It's the lining
of potato chip bags.

The clown in a straight jacket.

Sort of himself
he feels, I think.

Well, I'm Mark's wife,
the most important

person in his life,

and he feels
the love of his life

as he is mine,
and we've been married

for almost 14 years this month.

This is a special album
that I made.

This is a special album
that I made

just for Mark and me.

I hope he gets a chance
to see it someday.

It's called "Our Love Book."

This was
on our very first visit.

He looks so happy there.

We were--we had
just been married

a week by proxy when
I went down to visit him

and met him in person
for the first time.

He's just got so many aspects
to his personality.

He's just got so many aspects
to his personality.

Great sense of humor.

He's creative, very artistic.

Not autistic, but artistic.

Very good with his hands.

He draws well.

These are cards that he made
from start to finish.

They're braced behind
with strips of cardboard.

Gives it lots of dimension.

Mark and Bonnie DeFriest, KT95,
The Dark Side of the Moon.

If he had just accepted
his first brief sentence.

If he had just accepted
his first brief sentence

of four years, he probably
would have gotten out,

but his personality
didn't allow him to do that.

I think the only way
we're going to be able

to get him out is to prove
that he has some mental problems

and that he never should
have been incarcerated.

Hi, this is John Middleton.

Hi, Mr. Middleton.
This is Bonnie.

I haven't talked
to you for ages.

That's true. How are you doing?

Fine. How are you?

Fine. How are you?

Oh, just fine.
What's going on with Mark?

Well, I think,
you know, right now

Mark needs some hope
that he can hang onto.

What I hope to do, if possible,

because of, you know,
of mental problems,

I hope to get him released
for time served.

Well, the only two avenues
of relief for him is either

clemency or the Florida
Parole Commission.

The way that you would go about

pursuing either
of those two avenues

would be to get him psychiatrically
evaluated. Mm-hmm.

Would be to get him psychiatrically
evaluated. Mm-hmm.

I agree with that. Yeah.

That's the start. Good.

I just felt it's time
for a change.

This has gone on long enough
and if possible,

I want to talk to Mr. Middleton

and see if we can get him out.

I met Mark about 30 years ago.

Of anybody that
I know of in prison,

Mark is probably short
of a death row inmate,

one of the hardest people
to get out because Mark

has put himself in about as deep
a hole as you can get.

His parole date is well beyond
the expiration of his sentence,

which is an indication usually
that the Parole Commission

doesn't want
to let you out of prison.

The Commission has got a man
who is a notorious prisoner.

The Commission has got a man
who is a notorious prisoner

in the State of Florida
and probably

a notorious prisoner
across the country.

And the only way
he's ever going to get out is,

in my opinion, because
of his mental health status

and that finally society,
including the Parole Commission,

starts to address the issues
of the mentally ill in prison.

I have to review all that
in order to put it together

for the Commission
so they understand the...

for the Commission
so they understand the...

they understand how Mark
ended up where he is.

I was a wild child, you know.

They tried to get me interact
with other people and children,

and I was more interested
in how things worked.

I'd spend days down in there.

I'd spend days down in there.

They thought I was crazy
with my electronics

and chemicals and all this crap.

Couple times I blew myself up.

It got kind of weird.

I started working with my father
at an early age.

We had a real
close relationship.

There was a definitely
a father-son bond there.

Everett was like a...

to me, Everett was always
like an Indiana Jones.

To me, Everett was always
like an Indiana Jones.

I mean, I loved Everett.

You know, if it could be
done, Everett could do it.

And so I think
that's where Mark gets that.

Marilyn, his mother,
we'd hear her scream

about him and scream at him.

I'd see the stuff laid out

on the table, you know.

Like, what kind of stuff?
Like clocks.

He loved to take clocks apart.

Loved to.

I only met his mother twice.

I thought she was a cold bitch.

I thought that she didn't
really care for Mark.

I saw no love. I saw no hugs.

I saw no, I love you.

I saw nothing
of that nature with her.

His mother told me
that when his parents

were divorced and he was
sent to a school for boys

who were disruptive, I think
that's how she phrased it,

and he ran away from there.

And he ran away from there.

And because of having
been an escaper

early in his incarceration,
he has turned

the whole system
against himself.

Most people in jail,
even the mentally ill ones,

recognize that you don't
tick off the jailers.

He didn't get that.

He didn't get that.

I was going over there
on my breaks

and then someone
had something to say about that

because they don't like that.

But I had been over to see him,
and he just wanted me

to hurry up and leave
because, see, he had a plan.

Basically, our carpentry
training program here

consists of woodworking.

As you can see here, the class
has just finished a wood bench.

They sent me
to arts and craft school.

They sent me
to arts and craft school

and they got these
rolled up copper sheets.

I'm just looking at it and
looking at them thinking...

they really don't
want me to stay here.

It's all fucked up.

And then all the nuts in there,
they were all laughing at me

like it was a big fucking joke
or something.

Then everybody goes, ooh.

And just my luck, I'm looking
for somebody driving by

who would be happy enough
to donate their car

to a worthy cause
and there was nobody convenient.

There was no traffic.

There was no traffic.

So I said, oh, well,
backup plan two,

so I head for the swamp because
I've already been in there.

I know that.

At some point was it,
like, oh, my God,

you're married to--

Satan.

Satan.

Mm-hmm.

He escaped there--
From there,

and come out here,

but he broke
two or three bolt cutters

but he broke
two or three bolt cutters

trying to get out
of the handcuffs we figured.

And that's when they told me
that he had made some kind

of little old cap pistol,
you know, out of some

match heads
or something like that

and of course, they put it up
as a big, big thing, you know.

To Mark it wasn't
anything at all.

I loved him.

I loved him with all my heart,

I loved him with all my heart,

and he broke it...

into many pieces.

You go to a hospital
where they think

they can help you
and you make a gun

and you try to run away
and just keep getting

into trouble, more trouble,
more trouble,

more years, more years.

How long you think I'm going
to sit here and wait for you?

That's when I said forget this.

I just, you know, screwed it up.

Got in a bad situation
where I needed a car real quick

and got fucking jammed up
and caught by the police.

He wasn't out there
shooting people

or anything of that nature.

I don't think his crimes
involved pulling a gun

and stealing a car,
if I recall correctly.

And stealing a car,
if I recall correctly.

If you did that in Miami,
they'd give you a medal

for not shooting somebody.

But I think what happened is
is that the hospital

probably didn't
want him back either.

And then came
the Bay County Jail bullshit.

And here we go again.

We had a war going on,
a war of irritation.

Mark DeFriest reacts and
that's what he has done

through his entire prison life.

And when you react
in the prison system,

you get squashed down.

Proper intelligence training
teaches you how to deal

with all that crap.

I just tore the place down,
literally.

Then they put me
in another cell,

but I smashed the light out
and got in--

You could actually climb
in a pipe galley

and get all kind of metals.

I got these big long crowbars,
so I just bam,

and just rolled the door down
like a can of sardines.

Yeah, you've read
all the newspaper articles

and all that crazy shit?

I had them going there
for awhile.

Dr. Berland was
appointed by the court

to determine whether
or not Mr. DeFriest

was competent at the time
the offenses were committed

was competent at the time
the offenses were committed

and competent to stand trial.

Competency requires you have
a factual appreciation

of the nature of
the proceedings against you.

That means, do you know
what all the different roles

and procedures
are in the court system.

You know what a judge does,

you know what a prosecutor does,

you know how
a plea bargain works.

If I recall correctly,
there was some...

animosity between Dr. Berland and Mr.
DeFriest.

And I say animosity that only Dr.
Berland liked Mark DeFriest.

Whether or not that affected
his evaluation, I don't know.

He was very clever.

He was very clever.

In all of his escapes,
he was very clever,

very controlled, very planful.

He made working guns
from materials

he could assemble
in his cell in jail.

He was not confused.

He could follow
a long conversation

and stay on topic.

No bizarre statements
or actions.

He knew what was
going on around him.

And...

four of the five jailers,
they had seen no evidence

four of the five jailers,
they had seen no evidence

of behavior suggesting
the presence of delusions

and hallucinations, major thinking
disturbance, or despondency.

The fifth jailer,
only recently hired,

describes periods
of strange behavior

by the defendant
during which he would

appear to lose contact
with his surroundings,

eat bugs and stomp around
in his cell area

for no apparent reason.

You could imagine
what kind of story

the officers at the jail are
going to give concerning Mark.

They're going
to sit there, you know,

if it's a thumbs up
and a thumbs down,

they're going to go, does
it mean him going to trial?

They're going to go, does
it mean him going to trial?

Yeah, he's competent.

And there are actually
six psychologists

or psychiatrists who have
done evaluations on Mark,

four of which found him
to be incompetent

and only one of the six
had--determined him

to be competent to stand trial.

I offered an opinion in writing

and I said he was competent
and malingering.

Malingering is the outright
faking of symptoms

you don't have at all.

You know how you go through
phases in life?

I was in my gunsmith phase
where I could make a gun

out of anything.

You see this?

You see that's a toothpaste tube

if you look at it closely.

It's handled like a gun,

and it's not loaded,
don't worry.

They'd jack it up a level
and I'd jack it up some more.

Fuck them,
they can't take a joke.

Okay, did you make an escape
from that cell?

Yeah. I was in that cell
that they had specially

custom designed for me. Where'd you
get the stuff to make that last gun?

What do you want,
the whole low down.

What do you want,
the whole low down

on how all this shit
happened, is that it? Yeah.

When we--
Through the hall, man,

one of these dudes
says his damn mother

and shit's out there
and he wants to go back.

And he wasn't much help to you then, huh?
No, I says, holy shit, man.

I really got me a couple of
real, real good ones here.

Did you shoot at Crews? I
wasn't shooting at Crews.

You didn't shoot at him? What's
the purpose of it? He's done.

He's hidden anyway. How could
I shoot the son of a bitch?

And the only reason
I shot the gun off

was because Charlie says,
just check and see

what the gun really does.
So I aimed at some

plastic fucking
thing on the wall

and I struck and it went poof.

And I struck and it went poof.

And then the goon squad come in

and they beat
the fuck out of me.

You're lucky you weren't still holding
a gun. Yeah, so they tell me.

Really, they'd have killed you.
That's what they said.

Okay. So it is your contention
that you were not trying

to kill Crews? Hell no, man.

You can ask any
of them dudes up there.

They charged him
with attempted murder.

They charged him
with attempted murder.

He was placed
in solitary confinement,

lived in total darkness
in a small cell,

was not allowed to communicate.

There were post orders,

and in the post orders
it states,

"No clothes for prisoner.
No mattress or sheets.

No matches, cigarettes,
et cetera.

Conversation limited
to business only."

Mr. DeFriest was deprived
of all toiletries,

was deprived of toilet paper,
soap, tissue, toothpaste.

Was deprived of toilet paper,
soap, tissue, toothpaste.

The water was turned off
at his cell.

He could not flush his toilet.

He could not bathe or shower.

He had to eat without utensils
and in the darkness.

Yeah, they tried to torture me.

Yeah, they tried to torture me.

They were spraying
all them fire hoses and water

and all that bullshit
in there on me,

fucking trying to kill me.

So you have basically
a 10-day period,

11-day period of time where
Mark had all this trouble.

You have him being
evaluated by Dr. Berland,

You have him being
evaluated by Dr. Berland,

and you've got
an escape attempt,

and I'm not so certain
that a single human being

can take all of that at once.

They walked me
across the courthouse,

said, plead guilty to life
and we'll drop

all these other cases
we're charging you

you picked up in jail.

Man, I didn't give a shit.

I just wanted
to get out of that jail,

I just wanted
to get out of that jail,

whatever it took.

At sentencing,
this judge, quote,

"Now, have you been mistreated
in any manner by any person?

Defendant, "I guess you could--" I
guess you could call the way I'm being

treated now mistreated.

The defense counsel said
you had some comments,

you wanted to make
at this point.

Put it on the record.
Let's hear it.

Put it on the record.
Let's hear it.

"Well, I'm being held over there

in a hell's hole
right now, naked.

Look, I just want them to do
something about it, you know.

Give me a mattress
or some clothes."

I don't run the jail,
but I can suggest

to the jailers that
if you can't give him

a mattress and some clothes,
why don't you drive him

on down to Lake Butler today?

Ain't no way you can make
them give me a mattress?

Let me visit my wife?

We can sometimes
talk to the sheriff,

but I think he wants
you out of there,

Mr. DeFriest, just as bad
as you want to leave.

Let's hope so.

Buddy, call and see if I sentence Mr.
DeFriest today,

fingerprint him today
and he waives PSI--

Fingerprint him today
and he waives PSI--

See if they'll drive him
down to Lake Butler today.

That was it.

You have a psychological
report dated August 3rd.

By August 14th he's pled
and he's out of here.

Pled to a life sentence.

Now, I'm not certain
that that's due process.

Quick process, I don't know
if it's due process.

Quick process, I don't know
if it's due process.

But the bottom line is,
the amount of time

this man received is ridiculous

compared to most people
in the state prison system.

And I've been going in prisons
30 years, so I've seen a lot.

Oh, you got the Christmas card?

Well, I ain't got the card.

The letter's in here.

Not the card.

What's he say?

He says about
faithful friends here.

"Hello, my beloved friends.

Sorry I haven't
wrote much this year.

I keep hoping
and praying for good news

so I can write
a letter of good cheer,

so I can write
a letter of good cheer,

but nothing much ever happens
of a non-depressive nature.

Life just seems
to roll on, on, and on,

stuck in a quagmire
of stone and steel.

27 and 3/4 years now,

and no end in sight.

Though I have tried my best

to mind my own business
and keep to myself,

out of trouble,
hoping to make Level 3.

The plan had some
poignant moments

as I was abducted by aliens

as I was abducted by aliens

and locked up
in a solitary confinement

for two months over the summer.

So, my friends,
that's the situation update.

Please pray for me
as I often do for you folks.

I want you to send this letter

with a Christmas card
and note from Bonnie

to wish you all
a happy holiday season.

Please write soon.

In light, love,
and blessing, Mark.

20 years, look at that,
a lifetime's work.

20 years, look at that,
a lifetime's work.

He could be outside
producing things,

you know, doing things.

"I'm here, you're there.

Any idea what that means?

One of us is
in the wrong place."

He was offered a plea bargain,

and being young
and not legally wise,

he accepted it.

He got screwed over.

I remember Mark DeFriest.

I was the warden
at Florida State Prison,

the worst of the worst.

It's the prison
that houses death row

and the death chamber.

And it was regarded as the
hell hole of this earth.

And it was regarded as the
hell hole of this earth.

It was a place that if
you just mentioned FSP

to any offender anywhere
in the state of Florida,

you'd get his instant cooperation
because nobody wanted

to be sent
to Florida State Prison.

And that was often
done as punishment

to prisoners around the state.

If you couldn't control them,

if disciplinary measures
didn't help,

then you would bag them up,

put them on a bus and send them

to Florida State Prison
and they'd come back

with their tail
between their legs.

There's no TVs.
There's no radios.

There's no nothing.
There's nothing but death

and drama and all the bullshit

that went along with it.

It was a really
depressing place.

Solitary confinement
in a prison cell,

books and magazines
are contraband.

Do anything wrong
and they put you

on the consolidated
security list,

you don't get your one hour
of yard per week.

Not a day, a week.

So you can go two, three, four,

five, six, seven years,
and never see the yard.

There's just no way that
this endless punishment

is ever going
to make him behave.

He's just not
that kind of a person.

He doesn't react to that.
He's intelligent.

He recognizes abuse on the part.

He recognizes abuse on the part

of the criminal justice system.

He fights back against it.

Cuff up, DeFriest.

I know a lot
of secret prison crafts.

Weapons, locks and keys,
stashes,

all sorts of bizarre shit.

My prison file is
two-and-a-half feet thick

and it reads like a 007
James Bond spy novel.

And it reads like a 007
James Bond spy novel.

State of Florida Department
Corrections Disciplinary Report.

Possession
of escape paraphernalia.

Found a homemade handcuff key
in inmate DeFriest's

front pocket.
Gain time loss, 45 days.

X-rays showed clearly that
the key was in DeFriest's mouth.

Possession of a weapon,
piece of hacksaw blade concealed

between the lining and sole
of inmate DeFriest's right shoe.

Fuck it. Write a DR.

Department of Corrections
Disciplinary Report.

Failure to comply
with count procedure.

Inmate DeFriest answered
master count by saying--

James Bond 007.
Gain time loss, 90 days.

Inmate DeFriest broke the
ratchet end of the handcuffs.

Inmate DeFriest broke the
ratchet end of the handcuffs.

Destruction of state property.

Subject to reimburse the State
in the amount of $18.90

for the handcuffs. DeFriest
said-- Fuck that shit.

Possession of a weapon,
a homemade knife.

Possession of contraband.
Double twisted piece of wire.

Piece of ink pen tubing.
Gain time loss, 45 days.

One homemade ice pick,
12 inches in length.

Five .22 caliber bullets inside
a black sandal under the bed.

When asked for any statement
he would like to make,

inmate DeFriest stated--
I'm James Bond 007.

Aluminum handcuff keys,
seven hacksaw blades,

razor blades.

Where there's a will
there's a way,

and I'm not sure exactly
what all those keys fit.

We caution our officers when
they're wearing their keys,

you know how
you wear them on your belt?

We make sure--
They should be putting them

in their pocket
because if you wear them

in their pocket
because if you wear them

around and they're hanging
out where they can see them,

that's how this inmate,
we got one particular inmate

who's really good
at looking at the key cuts

and memorizing it
and then figuring out

some way to make something, a
key that would actually work.

Mark DeFriest.
That's who it was.

It just so happens
that the trays

that they were using at the time

were 3/16th of an inch thick,
and so you can slice them up

and make the teeth out of that.

So I made keys that fit
every prison lock in America.

So I made keys that fit
every prison lock in America.

We didn't give him
much opportunity

to do that in a long time.

Looking over this
brings back memories here.

Dr. Berland's report
is right here,

if I recall correctly.

Is that Berland?
That's Dr. Berland's report.

That document right there is
what was sent to the judge.

The commission is either
going to be open

to what we're trying to do,
or they're just going

to what we're trying to do,
or they're just going

to slam the door in our face.

And I think you have
to have something

eye catching to take
their eye off that file.

Something for them
to look at Mark as a person

and as a human being
with a mental health issue

as opposed to this inmate
who is incorrigible

and who gets more
disciplinary reports

than any other inmate, probably,
in the prison system ever.

The plan is to try to get
some legal help for him

based upon the fact that he was
originally sent to prison

against the advice
of certain psychiatrists

who felt he shouldn't
stand trial,

or he wasn't capable
of standing trial.

And based upon
all of the evidence,

of what this 28 years
of prison has done to him.

Mark was in the place
that they've changed

Mark was in the place
that they've changed

the name several times
to throw the media off,

but it's been called Q wing
and X wing and whatever.

I found that I had
a goon squad that was

beating inmates unmercifully.

I'd find inmates
laying in their cells,

eyes swollen shut.

It's always been my philosophy,

and that of the people I trust,

that convicted men and women
are sent to prison

that convicted men and women
are sent to prison

as punishment
and not for punishment.

There's a big difference.

But at Florida State Prison,
you'd continue to be

punished day
after day after day.

A lot of things were going on

at Florida State Prison that
most folks wouldn't believe.

I was wondering, can I talk
to you about a problem I got?

After years of silence, I really
need to share it with someone.

After years of silence, I really
need to share it with someone.

When I first came in here,
I was brutally gang raped

by 14 or 15 prisoners on J wing.

They hurt me so bad
I needed surgery

to put my body
back together again.

At what point
did you stop believing

you would ever
get out of prison?

Right then and there.

There was no coming out
of that shit.

Come on, man.

Come on, man.

Death was just a matter--
I'm already dead.

I was already dead.

I was a walking dead person.
Who gives a shit?

Nothing counted.

Nothing counted.
Nothing mattered.

So I just did the best I could

to stay alive and wage war.

For the last 16 years
I've been a chain gang punk,

and I confess I see more
of a girl now than a man.

And I confess I see more
of a girl now than a man.

I was a normal
19-year-old boy man

with a wife I thought I loved.

I wasn't gay or a transvestite,
but what's a poor girl to do

dropped in the zoo in this role
for as long as I'm in here.

I got this crazy Cuban husband
or jock or protector

or whatever
you want to call him.

They call him Uno.

He's got all sorts
of bizarre rules

and as long as I follow those
and behave like a lady

and as long as I follow those
and behave like a lady

at all times, he treats me
fairly well, I guess.

The whole prison
leaves me totally alone

being hooked up with him.

The problem is, I can never
take a break from my role

in the play as his woman,
and we have problems

when I grow tired of it.

This is my life
as Miss Wendy Castro

in the really dumb play
called prison.

Dr. Berland. Hi.

Bob Berland. John Middleton.
Nice to meet you.

Glad to meet you finally. How you doing?
Come on back.

Thank you.

Let me tell you what I
know of your history, Bob.

My understanding
is that you saw Mark

probably 1980ish, thereabouts.
I don't know exactly.

I think you were
working in Chattahoochee

or somewhere near there? Yes.

He had been sent there
because he was found.

He had been sent there
because he was found

incompetent to stand trial,

and you were the only
one that found him

to be competent, if I recall.
Is that right?

I'll tell you right off,
the report that I got

was very persuasive to Judge Minor.
Oh, absolutely.

But I'm going to just say this,

I think I was wrong. What?

I've done this for over 30 years

and I've learned a lot
about mental illness.

And people can be
manipulative looking

and clever and they can
think and plan

and clever and they can
think and plan

and still be mentally ill.

And when I use the term
"mentally ill,"

I mean psychotic,
biologically broken.

You step back and you look
at the big picture.

This kid was doing things
and not being anxious

about doing them,
that were clearly harmful

to his legal situation
even though he appeared

to know they were harmful
to his legal situation.

He was very talkative even
in stressful situations,

in interviews after arrests
or attempted escapes.

In interviews after arrests
or attempted escapes.

He laughed and joked
and was talkative

after trying to shoot people
with zip guns.

He was loud and boisterous
and rowdy

and tore up his cell repeatedly.

Frequent complaints
about headaches

even at times when it would
not affect evaluations.

That's an important one.

Even in my report somewhere
I said that he was, you know,

he used plans
and he was organized,

but people can be planful in
the service of strange ideas.

But people can be planful in
the service of strange ideas.

Well, let me--
And let me tell you

my thoughts on where we're going

as far as Mark is concerned.

Mark, you know, the
Florida Parole Commission

has the authority over Mark

to release him
over anybody else.

I have gotten people out that
have done a lot worse things

than Mark DeFriest has done.

But we're going to have to get
the commission to parole him

with the understanding
that if he screws up,

they can yank that parole.

If we mislead them into thinking

they can deal with him
rationally,

then they work against us. Well,
I agree with that. Absolutely.

Then they work against us. Well,
I agree with that. Absolutely.

Because you can sit there
and say he can't help it,

it's the way he is.

And that, you know,
and there are--

And the downside to that is that
they don't like the way he is.

I do think that
Dr. Berland appears

to be a very
seasoned psychologist.

And when I say
a seasoned psychologist,

I think he is
a different psychologist

today than he was when he first

interviewed Mark many years ago.

And that happens to all of us.

I suspected from reading
my old documents from 1981

I suspected from reading
my old documents from 1981

that he probably
was mentally ill back then.

My problem is that
right now I have yet

to quantify it
to find objective data

that supported the day that
have to be the final arbiter.

Okay.

You can come in. I'm sorry.

I was just sound checking
the microphone here.

You guys must be all set.
Has he eaten?

Yes. Okay.

If he needs to go
to the bathroom,

do I just wave
my hands at someone?

Yeah. We're good. Okay. Thanks.

Let me just finish
setting this up

and then I'll explain
what's going on

and introduce myself again.

And introduce myself again.

Okay. I don't know
if you remember me.

We met back in 1981. I
was a lot younger then.

I remember you.

Let me just back up
a little and start with

why I'm even here today,
lo these many years

later, because I think
it would help you

understand where
I'm coming from.

It was my opinion now that my
opinion then was inaccurate.

There were things
I didn't know then.

There were things
I didn't know then

that I know now
that would have made me

look at you differently.

Everything would have
been different.

Are you okay talking with me?

Sure.

Okay.

I'm going to read each of these
sentences to you one at a time,

and then you're going to tell me

if it's true or false for you.

All right. I like
Mechanics magazines.

Is that true or false for you?

True.

I have a good appetite.

I have a good appetite.

True.

I wake up fresh and
rested most mornings.

False.

My daily life is full of things
that keep my interested.

False.

I believe I am being followed.

Definitely.

I feel that I have often
been punished without cause.

True.

True.

I love my father or
if your father is dead,

I loved my father.

True.

I am sure I get
a raw deal from life.

Yeah, that one's true.

That's true? Yeah. Life sucks.

Much of the time my head seems
to hurt all over. True.

I have not lived the right
kind of life. True.

I often hear voices without
knowing where they come from.

False. My sex life
is satisfactory.

False. My sex life
is satisfactory.

False. Even when
I'm with people--

I wish I were a child again.

When I get bored I like to
stir up some excitement.

I often wish I were a girl.

I'm afraid of losing my mind.

Absolutely.

My mother is a good woman

or if your mother is dead,

my mother was a good woman.

True, I guess.

My soul sometimes
leaves my body.

False, but I've been trying.

Lots of hallucinogenics.

I am certainly lacking
in self confidence.

False.

I would like to be a florist.

Be a what? Florist.

Someone who works in a flower shop.
True.

Someone who works in a flower shop.
True.

That's it?

Well, that's it
for the test, yes.

I think we'll just
end it for today

and then we'll start up
again tomorrow.

Do you have any questions?

How is all this crap
relevant to my mental state?

Well, I suspect if I am right

about what I think
may be wrong with you,

that I may be able to make
your life a lot better.

That I may be able to make
your life a lot better.

Well, it was nice to see you again, Dr.
Berland.

You're a gentleman to even
say it, but yeah, I'm--

Yeah.

You said I was--
What was it?

You said I was
a malingering idiot?

Well, what can I say?

There are things
that you do and say

when you're young that you
then decide later were wrong.

But where's the fairness in all this crap?
I mean, for real.

But where's the fairness in all this crap?
I mean, for real.

I went to prison
when I was, what, 20

for doing a bunch
of stupid shit.

I ain't never hurt nobody,
and here I am still.

I've done 30 years
and got 30 more to go.

Well, ain't that nice.

This is his MMPI profile
from today.

This scale measures
all kinds of symptoms.

This scale measures
all kinds of symptoms

of mental illnesses
of all different types.

Everything below this line is
the normal range essentially.

It's 90 percent of the people

who get those scores
are considered normal.

So when it falls
above the score,

it's proven to be
clinically useful as a tool.

This score here on Scale L,
if he had had

everything else
in the normal range,

that score alone
would have told us

that score alone
would have told us

he had delusional
paranoid thinking.

Especially somebody
this paranoid tends to do

the preemptive strike thing.

I'm going to get you
before you get me.

Because he wants to feel like

he's in control in a setting

where everything tells you
you're not in control.

Hello? John?

Yes. Hey, it's Bob Berland.
I'm sorry to bother you.

Can you talk a minute? Sure.
You're not bothering me at all.

I saw Mark DeFriest today,
and we know from the MMPI

there's something out there.

There's something out there.

We're not just spitting
in the wind here.

He really, this is a good MMPI

and he's really mentally ill,

and now I've got to develop it,

and I don't want
to just go in there

with one source of data
because they're not going

to believe me.

I think that at least,
in part, his problems stem

from brain injury,
but I still have to prove that.

At this point,
a lot of what I have

other than the fact that
he's genuinely psychotic

is intuitive and that isn't
going to stand up anywhere.

Is intuitive and that isn't
going to stand up anywhere.

Hi, doctor, how are you? Bob Berland.
Glad to meet you.

Good to see you.

Hi. Hi.

Barbie Taylor, nice to meet you.
Glad to meet you.

Come on in.

Have a seat. Thank you.

I get collateral data.

I like to get information
besides what I get

I like to get information
besides what I get

from the defendant themselves
because decision makers

prefer to hear it
and it helps give me

a check on truthfulness
and sometimes

the mentally ill people
don't want to admit

to what's wrong with them,
so I have to go around them.

You shouldn't be intimidated.

There's no right answer.

I don't expect you to remember
things you can't remember.

What kind of things did he do
to earn disciplinary reports?

I would say that a number
of the disciplinary reports

I would say that a number
of the disciplinary reports

that were filed
against Mark DeFriest

were false accusations.

By staff? By certain staff.

Were there
substantiated complaints

against him as well?

At times. They were minor.

Okay.

It was things like the kind
of language that he might use

when he was being interviewed

by a correctional officer.

He talks about having
killed the president

and that's why he's in there.

And he makes a joke
of that all the time.

And he makes a joke
of that all the time.

Okay. And that's kind
of an odd thing to say.

Why do you-- do you have any
sense of why he says that?

I think he's just being funny

and he's using one last vestige

of humor, you know,
where he finds it.

I don't know.

All right, gentlemen,
I agree, I admit it.

I shot Lincoln.

All right then.

I'm going to ask you
some questions today.

What I need to do
is get other data

so that I can make a good case

to whoever is going
to listen to this,

whether it's in Florida
in the parole board

or the medical staff here.

This evaluation is about
finding out the truth.

I told you the truth.
What I do to survive

is considered
unacceptable behavior.

Is considered
unacceptable behavior.

So now we're
at this point in reality

where it really
doesn't matter anymore.

So I'm just more interested
in what you've got to say.

Well-- From a scientific
point of view.

You know I'm a scientist, right?
I didn't, but--

He'll tell you, man. I've done
a lot of firsts in prison.

You do know that he played with a lot
of electricity. No, I didn't know that.

Okay. He played
with electricity a lot.

I mean, to the point
where he would, you know,

rewire things, make things.

Rewire things, make things.

Sony built the Walkman.

I built the Buttman in 1989.

The what? The Buttman.

I'm not even going to go there.

You know, nowadays
they got all kind

of little micro radio,
MP3 players and all,

I mean, real small shit, right?

There's all kind
of problems associated

with first off, making a radio

small enough
to keep it in your ass.

And then the sound,
man, you want--

You want something
that sounds decent,

at least a graphic equalizer

and everything else, right?

I mean, I put
the whole radio together.

It was about that big,
about the size

of a big cigarette lighter.

Of a big cigarette lighter.

And like I said, Sony
made the first Walkman,

but I made the first Buttman.

Saturday night.

They just counted
and I ripped off my G.I. Joe

action battle assault pipe,
AC/DC rocking on Rock 105,

"Highway to Hell."
I built a new micro.

Her name is Suzy Q in honor of--

Nazi motherfuckers murdered.

I doubled my workout
to 500 jumping jacks,

I doubled my workout
to 500 jumping jacks,

500 situps, 500 pushups,
250 knee bends,

and I am running two hours.
I may need it to survive.

This place is a trip.
Flash to 9:24 P.M.

I set the radio up,
Alice in Chains, "Man in a Box."

Party tonight. A bomb landed.

Four coffee bags,
half ounce of weed,

crime goes on. G.I. Joe online.

10:02 P.M., yes, yes, yes,
Gun N' Roses redoing.

"Knocking on Heaven's Door,"
one of my all-time

favorite songs. Sing it, Axl.

Favorite songs. Sing it, Axl.

Lift off, lift off.
Daddy's online early.

Fuck it.

Eddie singing
with David Lee Roth,

Van Halen, tripping.

I am drinking
a hot cup of coffee.

Joy.

Now reloaded.

Pink Floyd, The Wall,
locked and loaded,

waiting on tray pickup.

They're starting showers
on the first floor.

â™ª My love opens the heart â™ª

â™ª My love opens the door â™ª

Sing it.

Sing it.

â™ª My love opens the door â™ª

Awesome.

Digital separation sound

Saturday night madhouse,
tripping.

Aliens plotting on me.

So sad.

Pink Floyd, lunatic, joy,
Suzy Q in her place.

"Dark Side of the Moon."

â™ª I'll see you
on the dark side of the moon â™ª

Mark was strongly disliked

by the goon squads,
and, of course,

the more disciplinary
reports you get,

the more serious
of a management problem

you're considered,
and thus the more

severely you're treated.

I explained my suspected abuse

by some correctional staff.

The psychological and psychiatric
staff agreed with me.

They said that they had noticed

numerous times that
he had bruises or cuts

and that each time
that the staff

and that each time
that the staff

had responded that Mark
was abusive to himself.

That he had hurt himself.

And it was immediately
laid out to me that

there was nothing
they could do for him.

Have you had periods
of time not caused

by drug use or alcohol use

or sleep loss where you would

just seem to feel
unusually sluggish.

I'm trying to tell you
about my headaches.

I told you I get
real bad headaches.

I told you I get
real bad headaches.

And when I get real bad
headaches, like, yeah,

I guess you can say
I get like that.

I want to make sure
I've explored

the headaches thoroughly.

Were they frequent
or occasional but severe?

I just remember him,
as he got older,

as always having headaches.

And I can't give you an age

when I thought they started,

but I always remember
Mark and Excedrin.

Did they start
at a certain point

or did you have them for as long

as you can possibly remember?

Yeah. That's the answer
to that one.

Yeah. That's the answer
to that one.

Like, since I--
First conscious memory.

I always had headaches.

And do you wake up
with them or do you--

Sometimes, yeah.
You know, I only sleep,

like, two, three,
four hours a day.

I sleep more than four hours

and I wake up with a
monstrous ass headache.

Are you aware of him
having any major blows

to the head at any point,

even if you didn't witness it?

I'm not aware of that.

Okay.

Okay.

What I am aware of
is only a hearsay.

Okay.

That Everett,
who was his father,

would get home at night,
and Marilyn,

who was his mother,
would have shaken him

and said, you know,
I've had it with this child,

you know,
and she would shake him.

I believe firmly in my heart,

he was shaken a lot.

Have you ever heard
of shaken baby syndrome?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Your brain sloshes around

and it causes damage
even though your head

and it causes damage
even though your head

doesn't hit anything.

A lot of times when people

have major falls,
even if they don't

hit their head, they
suffer brain injury.

How about when I flew out
of the Leon County Jail?

I was on the third floor
and some Klingons

were pointing some guns at me

and they said,
"Stop or we'll shoot."

I said, "Shoot, cocksucker"
and jumped?

Does that count?

They put me in an
all-black cell block.

There was 19 blacks in there,
and I'm the only white guy,

There was 19 blacks in there,
and I'm the only white guy,

and they tell me, they said,
listen, motherfucker,

if this guy fucks up
and does anything wrong,

we're taking y'all's TV
and canteen privileges.

He is very much a loner.

He wouldn't be comfortable
in crowds.

He wouldn't be comfortable
in a store.

He wouldn't be at all
comfortable in a group.

I don't like
being around people.

Okay. But specifically--

I mean, a lot of people,
you get perceptions

I mean, a lot of people,
you get perceptions

of what people are going
to do or thinking--

What kind of perceptions
would you get?

But most of the time
I was right.

And I'm not disputing that.

I just--I'm trying
to find out what--

What it felt like to you.

It just felt like
they would, you know...

Like they were a threat to you?
Yeah.

But I knew one of
the dudes in there.

He was a dude
named Cecil Hunter,

and he says, yeah, you know,
we're trying to escape.

I said, that's a great idea.

What do you got?
What are you doing?

So they pull out
these HS12 Remedy DuPont

carbon chip
diamond blades, right?

I said, how long
have you guys had these?

I said, how long
have you guys had these?

Oh, we had them about a month.

I said, what are
you still doing here?

So I ripped the toilet
off the wall,

took the damn
light fixtures apart,

got some pipes and made
a dope barrel zip gun.

So I started sawing the bars.

It takes eight hours
to get through one cut,

eight hours to get
through another cut,

and I got to admit, things
were coming apart in there.

A lot of them just
saying they were about

to take that gun away from
me and stick it in my ass.

So at 9:00 I made the
move and Bob Seger

was on the TV playing
"Turn the Page."

â™ª Here I am on the road again â™ª

When you were escaping,
were you doing it

as much for entertainment

or because you really
thought you could get away?

Coming to prison, you know,
it's like a big game.

They say you can't,
and I say I can,

and it's kind of funny.

I landed in the girls'
exercise yard.

I actually jumped up
and I flipped myself up

on the top of the razor wire,

and I was so wired up,
I was two miles down

the jail before I even realized

I had broke both feet
and my wrists.

I got a truck going and it
run through a roadblock.

This cop pulls up right
behind me in a Ford Fairmont.

I just put the thing in reverse

and the truck
just climbed right up

on top of the car
and smashed the roof down.

And then they started
to blast the truck

out from under me, man.

I got down on the floor
and hit the gas

and it got stuck
in somebody's living room.

So they were really,
really upset, man.

The reason I ask all
this is because

you talk about
you being a survivor,

but it seems like
the things that

you think you've done
to help you survive

have caused you more trouble

and that's what I'm
trying to understand.

No, I'm still alive and lots
of people I know ain't.

No, I'm still alive and lots
of people I know ain't.

But if you had been able to
not do some of these things

that got you in trouble
with the authorities,

might you have been out
on the street sooner?

Yeah. I'd been gone long ago.

You know, if I was just a rapist

or a murderer or something,
they'd let me out.

I'm the idiot that made
them look like idiots.

Hello. Hey.

How'd it go? It was good.

Very good. Told them all
about the assassination

of President Lincoln.

I don't think
he's where he should be.

I think he needs help
and I don't think

he's where he should be.

And I don't think
he's going to get

the help he needs where he is.

This is the Florida
Parole Commission.

This is the Florida
Parole Commission.

This is the Hearing Room A
where three times a month

hearings are conducted
for persons,

inmates incarcerated
in Florida who are hoping

to get paroled
at some point in time.

The PPRD, that's the Presumptive
Parole Release Date,

and for this individual, it's
currently set for August 13th, 2082.

And we are recommending, our
parole examiner is recommending--

And we are recommending, our
parole examiner is recommending--

They're requesting
an extension of 60 months.

That is based on?

His DRs. Okay.

Those would be--
The DRs are the--

Disciplinary Reports. Okay.

And how many are here in this--

I think we have a total of 25

from his last
subsequent interview.

Okay, so those
are the types of things

that the Commissioners
would be addressing

tomorrow and making
their decision

based on the inmate's behavior.

After having read the file,
it's quite interesting.

After having read the file,
it's quite interesting.

Understatement.

This is really the first
and only parole hearing

that Mark has ever had.

In 29 years, no one has ever

attended a parole hearing of his

because Mark has never felt

there was any possibility

that he would ever get paroled.

That he would ever get paroled.

But this time, Dr. Berland,

he has the information
to really try

to help Mark, and it's
time to get him out.

Tomorrow is
a ten-minute presentation.

I'll take up about two or three,

you can take up three or four,

and you can take up a couple.

The bottom line is,
what they would normally do

looking at Mark's file
as it sits right now,

they've got DRs there
where he's threatened

to firebomb an officer
and do all kinds of things.

They've got DRs of that nature.

They've got DRs of that nature.

They generally would
at least extend him

16 months, if not, 120 months.

I mean, they'd take him
into the next century,

you know, based upon his record.

Our plan is to ask
for your interview.

Our plan is to ask
for a recommendation

for a psychological counseling
and medication as directed

by the counselors
as well as hopefully

monitoring by you, Dr. Berland,

as far as his prognosis.

And, also, hopefully
they will knock off.

And, also, hopefully
they will knock off

some time to give,
to give Mark a sign.

Yeah. He's without hope
at this point, totally.

Well, I'm optimistic
of getting something.

The perfect things
I told you the other day

would get a parole date
down to 2015,

give him a year interview,
and if that occurs,

and Mark doesn't accept
that sign or olive branch,

whatever, if that doesn't
happen after medication,

we can't really
do anything more.

I'm Tena Pate
and I'm a parole commissioner

for the state of Florida.

I serve as the vice chair
on the commission.

I do tons of research
on my cases.

Mr. DeFriest, the offense
that he has committed,

offenses he has committed,
he may well have been

paroled long before now.

I mean, we don't have
sex assaults,

we don't have homicides.

We don't have homicides.

We don't have a lot
of the other violent crimes

that really, you know,
are difficult to parole on.

But, I mean, he has thousands
of entries in his record.

Like, got 120 month
extension one year,

240 months another time.

And we're in control of it.
We can extend the date

at some point if we need to
based on additional behaviors,

or we can reduce that date.

Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

Welcome to this meeting of the
Florida Parole Commission.

Before we begin, I'm going
to ask Chaplain Alex Taylor

from the Department
of Corrections

to lead us in an invocation,
if you'd please stand.

Thank you.

Let us pray.

Justice is a very high
and lofty goal.

Mercy is sometimes very risky.

But the lives of men
and women wounded by crime

are very precious
and dear to us all.

We ask that mercy and justice

stand close by
in our midst to guide

stand close by
in our midst to guide

each decision rendered
by the Commission today

so that hope is not defeated,

and the citizens
of Florida are well served.

This is our prayer.

Amen. Amen.

I'm Commissioner Fred Dunphy.

I'll be serving
as the Chair of the panel

this morning,
and the panel consists

of Commissioners Tena Pate

and Monica David.

If for some reason
they are unable to agree,

the case will be referred
to me as chair of the panel.

Commissioners,
are we ready to being?

Absolutely.

Commissioners, the first case.

Commissioners, the first case

I'd like to take is just
one case out of turn,

and we'll call the case
of Mark DeFriest.

It's on page 131.

This is a subsequent
interview that occurred

on September the 22nd of '08
at an undisclosed location.

The examiner
is recommending an extension

of 16 months based
on the receipt

of numerous process
disciplinary reports.

We'll be glad to hear
what you have to say.

Thank you, Commissioners.

This is a very difficult case.

This is a very difficult case.

I've represented Mark DeFriest
since he was 23 years old.

He's now 49 years old.

Since I've represented him,
I've had two children.

One's in college,
and all this time

Mark has sat in prison
for crimes that normally

a person would not spend
that much time in prison.

And because of his behavior,
he has remained in prison.

But what I do think,
Commissioners,

is that Mark can do
what's necessary of him

to at least be
considered for parole

and he has not been able
to do that in the past.

I recognize that,
and I'm not here

to even talk about
his prison record

to even talk about
his prison record

because that would be
silly for me to do so.

Mark, when he pled
many years ago,

there was a question
about his competency,

and what's unusual
is the gentleman sitting

back to the right of me
is the person whose reports

the court relied upon
in finding him competent.

Dr. Berland would like to say a
few words for you if he could.

I originally saw him in 1981
and at the time thought

he was pretending
to be incompetent,

and because of that, I thought
he was also not mentally ill.

And because of that, I thought
he was also not mentally ill.

And when I say mentally ill,
I mean psychotic.

I evaluated him again
in 2009 with testing

and interview
and both independently

indicated a severe
psychotic disturbance.

Psychosis is the result
of a biological malfunction

in the brain, most often
from brain injury

or inherited disorder
or as I think in his case,

some combination of the two.

I believe his bad behavior
in lockup from '81

to the present has been
largely the result

to the present has been
largely the result

of this psychotic disturbance,

especially the manic
paranoid part.

There is no reason
not to try medicating him

and see if he acts better,
including in a less closely

confined setting in prison.

I think I've said
everything I need to.

Thank you.

I'm Bonnie DeFriest. I'm
Mark DeFriest's wife.

For the 15 years
that we've been married,

I've been Mark's
closest confidante

and support person, his
lifeline, so to speak.

He tells me if it wasn't for me

he would have gone
over the edge long ago.

We have a solid relationship.

We have a solid relationship

throughout which
I have shown him

a deep personal commitment based

on a profound soul level,

love unconditionally,
and my entire focus

and purpose has been
to help him heal,

mentally, emotionally,
and physically.

Because make no mistake
about it,

Mark's incarceration
itself has added

to whatever psychiatric problems

he came in with.

People were dying
all around me, man.

The goon squad was
killing people off the books.

The State was killing people
legally, or so-called legally.

43 people died when I was
in that special cell,

one woman and 42 men.

Ronald Straight, Danny Remeta,

G. Stano, James Bundy
was my neighbor for a long time.

I was in the cell
right above him

when they barbecued
his dumb ass.

It was just like the Wild
Wild West of Corrections.

It was just like the Wild
Wild West of Corrections.

It was a sad place.

And it was just as I thought
that I might have the goods

on this goon squad
and stop some of the beatings

that were going on,
I get this announcement

that I'm going
to be moved to Orlando.

And I know that
if things are really hot

in Florida State Prison,
it wasn't a question

of if an inmate
was going to be killed,

but only when would it happen.

"Saturday, July 17th, 1999.

My dear honey,
they're gassing Frank right now.

The exhaust fans just went off
and they locked all the doors.

Frank is the one
on my left shoulder

in the X wing photo
in the orange shirt.

They're getting really wild
about their beatings these days.

With Captain Thornton on set,
they may beat him to death.

That cracker is crazy.

Poor Frank.

10:03, no action. All is quiet.

10:03, no action. All is quiet.

10:11 A.M. No action.

Don't know what's going on.

10:13, flash, here they come.

Aliens on two west floor.

I heard Thornton say,
are you ready to come out?

And he got
a 'Suck my dick, fuckboy.'

So they went in and I hear them
beating the shit of him.

He's fighting them hard.

They got him in the hallway
beating on him still.

Jumping up and down on him now.

They killed him.

Poor Frank.

Poor man.

Shiteaters beat him to death.

It could have
just as easily been me.

If you get this,
it'll be a miracle.

I send all my love, Mark."

It needs to be recognized

that the Florida
Department of Corrections

took a low-level,
non-violent prisoner

and turned him into
what Mark DeFriest became

and turned him into
what Mark DeFriest became

in the Florida prison system.

We failed Mark DeFriest.

Now that reliable
professional opinion

has been brought
to the forefront,

we can finally
begin to help Mark

change his behavior and his
life in a realistic way.

Thank you. Thank
you, Commissioners.

I think that this case
is a little bit

different than
some of the others.

Different than
some of the others.

And certainly
under normal circumstances

I would ask
for extension of his date,

but because his date
is already so high,

based on his age
and his tentative

release date, I think that
I could make no change.

And then I would be
willing to recommend

to the Department of Corrections

that they evaluate him
for mental health counseling

that they evaluate him
for mental health counseling

and also recommend, you know,
any psychotropic medications

as needed.

So I think
that would be my vote.

I will agree with you
to make no change.

I am pleased to see
that he has not had

any disciplinary reports
since April of '08,

I believe, but I understand

he's doing this
without medication.

You might have had
a good talk with him

to tell him not to engage
in these behaviors again,

which is telling for me.

Which is telling for me.

So I don't doubt at all that
he has mental health issues.

Whether or not they are
psychotic in nature

is another issue.

So because
of his extensive record,

I would like a two-year review.

Give him more time to show us

that he has changed
because we have such

an incredible record of DRs.

I don't think one year is
going to be enough for me.

That's probably going to be in
y'all's best interest, too.

I know you don't want
to hear that,

I know you don't want
to hear that,

but I'm okay
with the two-year review

because, you know,
bureaucracy is bureaucracy,

and I don't know
that we can accomplish

what we want to accomplish
in this case within a year.

Right. So I think
Commissioner Pate's right.

And, I mean, I think for him,
just getting a no change

with all those DRs is something.
Exactly.

Thank you, Commissioners,
for the time.

We appreciate it.

Thank you very much.
Thank you all.

Hey, Mark. How you doing, man?

All right.

Have a seat, buddy. Still alive.

I can see that. How you been?

I just made Level 3
in the system.

I just made Level 3
in the system.

I just got here last month.

Is that the lowest level here?

Yeah, there's a lot
of freedom here.

They needed somebody
to paint their cellblock

in the south unit up there, A3,

and I volunteered
and they gave me

a job painting.

They let me run a crew
and I recruited

two other guys and we painted

the whole place for them.

And you were commended by your

classification officer,
right, how well you did?

Yeah. He said I did
a real good job.

Basically they gave me
a pizza party.

Basically they gave me
a pizza party.

Okay, Mark.
How come you've cut down

this DR pattern that you have?

Well, I never thought I was
ever getting out of prison.

So, I mean, what is there

but to live for the moment?

But there is some difference now.
It matters.

I mean, you've given me
the first glimpse

of, you know, having some sort

of normal life, you know?

Getting out of here. Getting out
of here and watching the sun set.

You understand you can't use
an inmate's PIN number.

You understand you can't use
an inmate's PIN number

to make a phone call to call your wife.
Absolutely.

And you understand that
you can't have apple juice

in a Suave bottle.
You can't do anything.

Do you understand that? Yeah. I
can't get any disciplinary report.

You can't get
any disciplinary reports.

Are you willing to commit
to the commission

that you will do that
and absolutely understand

that you can no longer
just exist for today,

that you have to exist
for tomorrow and plan?

Can you do that?

Yeah, I think I can.

Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

We're glad you're with us today

on this nice cold
morning in Tallahassee.

The first case
is Item 1, Page 1.

Mark DeFriest.

Good morning, Mr. Middleton.
Good morning, Commissioners.

How are you? Welcome.

The examiner is recommending

an extension of 60 months

due to process
disciplinary reports.

For the record, Commissioners,

the last time this case came up,

he had 25 process DRs.

He had 25 process DRs.

That's what he had,
and they were serious DRs.

They weren't
telephone violations

or anything of that nature.

And what's happened,
Commissioners,

it's this commission's actions
that has caused this change

in behavior for Mr. DeFriest.

Right now
his parole date is at 2082.

This commission can take action
in this case to encourage him

to continue on his path
of good behavior.

He's trying to send you
a message.

Why don't you send him one back

and say we appreciate what you--

You're trying to do.

It won't hurt
the commission at all.

It won't hurt
the commission at all.

You know, I got to tell you.

You know, Mr. Middleton
says that, you know,

he's sending a message. Boy, that's a
funny message to send, getting DRs.

Look, this case is very
frustrating for everybody,

and, you know,
I heard of Mr. DeFriest

the first time I took a tour,

before I even heard the case
out of Florida State Prison

when I first got up here.
He's infamous, you know,

as an escape artist
and all this kind of stuff.

What--
If you want--

I just can't get past
the fact that we--

That what we did--we said
we'll take a pause,

see what you can do
and he comes back

with this kind of behavior.
The--

With this kind of behavior.
The--

It's not changing.

It has changed, Commissioner.

Okay. We're going to,
we're going to extend

his date by 12 months.

All right, Commissioners.
The next case--

I always said he was
born at the wrong time.

I always said
he should have been born

in the Wild ld West days
where they shoot 'em up,

in the Wild ld West days
where they shoot 'em up,

and I always thought
that when he died

he would go out shooting.

I just wish...

that things could have
been different

and that he could have,
you know,

been exposed to school
and been exposed

to computers
as they came out and--

And to everything
that's happened

in 27 and 3/4 years,
like he said.

Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

Can you imagine what that
brain could have done?

â™ª Knocking on heaven's door â™ª

â™ª Knock, knock, knocking
on heaven's door â™ª

It happened a long time ago,

but I still feel sorry
for the kid, you know?

And he's no kid no more.

I was a young dumb kid
when I came to prison.

You couldn't really talk to me
or tell me anything, you know.

I didn't--
I wasn't willing to listen.

I didn't--
I wasn't willing to listen.

But look at me now. I'm old.

I've got gray hair and wrinkles
and hearing aids and, you know?

I've been in prison 30 years.
I'm tired.

I want to just be left alone.

Go somewhere and get a job,
take care of my wife.

Live with some semblance
of a normal life.

â™ª That cold black cloud
is coming down â™ª

â™ª I feel I'm knocking
on heaven's door â™ª

For more, we're joined now
by the film's director,

Gabriel London.

We've had a chance to tour
around with the film

particularly in Florida.

This is the ballot box
that asked audiences

whether he should have
conditional parole release.

â™ª Never thought I'd get caught
and wind up in prison â™ª

â™ª Chalk it up to youth,
but young age I ain't dissin' â™ª

â™ª Chalk it up to youth,
but young age I ain't dissin' â™ª

â™ª I guess I just had
to get it out of my system â™ª

â™ª Out of my system â™ª

The commissioners
have all seen the film

and they've decided
to meet again.

In just a couple of weeks.

To consider an early parole date
for Mark DeFriest.

Good morning, everyone. We're
glad you're with us today.

We have some high-profile
cases on the docket.

It is my position
that Mr. DeFriest

is a prisoner of his own making

is a prisoner of his own making

so my vote here would be

to make no change to the PPRD

of August 13, 2085.

My vote is to reduce
his date by 845 months

for a PPRD of March 13, 2015.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. Thanks.

Mark DeFriest was 19
when he was sent to jail.

On Wednesday, the commission
on offender review

cut his release date
from 2085 to next year.

Cut his release date
from 2085 to next year.

It's a good day.

It's a good day in Florida.

Yes, it is.

â™ª If you don't live now â™ª

â™ª You ain't even trying â™ª

â™ª Then you're on your way
to a midlife crisis â™ª

â™ª Living it out
any way you feel â™ª

â™ª You can feel it in your bones
but try to deny it â™ª

â™ª Wipe it off your face,
but your eyes won't hide it â™ª

â™ª You knew it all along

â™ª You knew it all along

â™ª They told me
not to steal cars â™ª

â™ª Said I'd wind up in prison â™ª

â™ª Thought I knew it all,

â™ª Chalk it up to young age,

â™ª I guess I just had

Mark DeFriest, evidently
he is living with his--

With his Las Misrabels.

How does that--

What is that movie?

Le--the--

"Les Miserables."

Yeah, right. You know it.

Yeah, right. You know it.

Now, he had a hell
of time, didn't he?

But he lived through it.
