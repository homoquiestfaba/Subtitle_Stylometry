<i>[Boy Narrating] If I'd walked out</i>
<i>of the showroom right then...</i>

<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

You should be in school. Scram.

<i>But I didn't leave,</i>
<i>and nothing was the same after that.</i>

How much is this one?

This one?

About 50 more years on your paper route,
sonny. That's how much.

And that works out to...

3,500. You happy?
Now, beat it!

<i>I presume you'd consider</i>
<i>lowering the price if I paid you in cash.</i>

<i>The money's legitimate, gentlemen.</i>

You heard him. Keep out of this.
Oh, right.

Kid might've murdered his parents.

But to Mickey, a sale's a sale.
Will you both shut up.


You got five minutes to explain
before I call the cops, kid.

My name is George Devereaux.
I'm 15.

I live on the Upper West Side
with my parents and my half brother.

<i>This afternoon, my mother returned home</i>
<i>a day early from a trip to the shore.</i>

Mrs. Devereaux. We weren't
expecting you until tomorrow.

A lady should never do
what anyone expects of her, Henry.

<i>[George Narrating] My parents'</i>
<i>marriage is not what you'd call seamless.</i>

[Elevator Bell Dings]

Holy shit.

Yep.

<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>My father's a band leader.</i>

<i>Normally, he's better dressed than this.</i>

<i>His stage name is Dan Devereaux.</i>
<i>You might've heard of him.</i>

<i>Although his real name is Dan Hamilton.</i>
<i>He's from Paris, Texas...</i>

<i>not Paris, France.</i>
## [Singing, Indistinct]

<i>He made a lot of money</i>
<i>off a song he wrote called...</i>

# My one and only #

<i>The only thing louder</i>
<i>than its arrangement is its irony.</i>

<i>My father is an artist...</i>

<i>with all the strengths</i>
<i>and weaknesses that implies.</i>

<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
<i>[Man] Dan, two-minute call.</i>

Comin'.
<i>As much as my father's life...</i>

relies upon improvisation...

my mother's life is guided
by a large number of aphorisms.

Sayings.
Like, for example...

<i>[Mrs. Devereaux]</i>
<i>What you do while you're in a room...</i>

You don't wanna go in there.
<i>is never as important as how</i>
<i>you enter or leave it.</i>

[Screams]
Please. Don't get up.

This isn't what it looks like.
Really? Well, what does it look like, child?

Danny!
Of course it's what it looks like, Sherry.

My wife's not an idiot, for Christ's sake.
<i>Thank you, darling.</i>

That's the nicest thing
you've said to me all year.

Here. Let me help you.

<i>You know, you really</i>
<i>shouldn't wear this color.</i>

It makes you look like a tramp.

What am I saying?
You are a tramp.

Hey. What are you doin'
with that suitcase?

I'm leaving you.
Oh, Christ, honey.

Come on. You know
you're not gonna leave me.

Never contradict a woman
while you're in your underwear.

It puts you at a great disadvantage.

I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. Baby, I am.
You know I do these crazy things.

But they don't mean anything.
No offense, Sherry. Sherry?

Oh, come on now, honey.
Be realistic.

W-Where would you go?
What would you do?

Where's my passport?
Oh, hell. Go on then. Leave me.

I don't need you around here anyway. All
you do is hold me back and spend my money.

And everybody knows that.
What a relief for you then.

Well, what about the boys?
<i>Boys?</i>

Yeah. George, Robbie. The boys.
You remember them?
Where are they?

They're at school, Miss Devereaux.
Why?

I'm going to take them with me.
And do what?

Raise them.
You?

Well, you don't think I'm leaving them here
with the likes of you, do you?

Give me a break.
You're a lousy mother.

I love my children.
So what?

I love my kids, and I'm shit for a father.

Bernice?
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

Am I a lousy mother?

It's not my place to say, Miss Devereaux.

But if you wanna know the God's honest...

There.
Aw, shit.

Go on, then.
Take the damn kids. What do I care?

<i>[Elevator Whirring]</i>


<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

<i>[Elevator Doors Close]</i>
<i>[Narrating] Ten minutes later...</i>

<i>my mother took my brother and me out of school.</i>
Shit.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Devereaux, but your boys
don't attend this school anymore.

Of course they don't.

I'm sorry, Mr. Connors.
I'm just very upset.

<i>They go to...</i>
Radford.

Radford. Of course.

They go to Radford.

Where is Radford?

<i>[Narrating] My brother Robbie was playing</i>
<i>Lady Macbeth in the Scottish play.</i>

It is so nice to see that
there are still some gentlemen left.

Thank you.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>He was playing Lady Macbeth?</i>

In Shakespeare's time,
all the women's roles were played by men.

Right. I knew that.

That's all the cash there is in here,
Mrs. Devereaux.

And all the jewelry.
Of course.

What's in that cloth there?

Oh.
I'll take that too.

Will that be all, Mrs. Devereaux?

That will be all. Thank you.

George, darling.

I want you to take this money
and go and buy us an automobile.

A car? Why? Where's Dad?

First things first.
We need a car.

Well, what kind of car?
What kind would you like?

I don't want a car.
A Jaguar.

Admirable taste as always, darling.

But we need something more practical.

A Chevy?
Perhaps not that practical.

So here I am,
and that's the car I want.

It's not as easy as that, son.

Is there a problem, George?
Have a seat, Mrs. Devereaux.

Well, thank you, Fred.

May I call you Fred?
By all means.

Well, how much is the car we want?

It's, uh, 3,500, ma'am.

Give it to the nice man, George.
That's not how you do it, Mom.

That's not how you do what?
Your son means that...

you offer me less than that,
and then we bargain.

All right. $1,000.

[Chuckling]
This is so much fun.

What?

<i>It's a little low, Mom.</i>

<i>Offer me, say, 2,500.</i>
All right, then.

2,500.

No.
<i>What do you mean, no?</i>

You just said, "Offer me 2,500."

I can let you have it for 33, Mrs. Devereaux,
but that's as low as I can go.

2,700.

3,275.

2,950, Fred, or we're out of here
faster than a cat in a rainstorm.

Huh?
<i>[George] What about Dad?</i>

What does he have to say about all this?

Your father has betrayed us,
and I never wanna hear his name again.

What about marrying my father again?

Once was an adventure.
Twice would be a perversion.

Look, you can't just take a kid
away from his father like this.

Ask any psychiatrist.
A boy needs his father's influence.

That is what the telephone is for.
I'm not going.

Well, who's gonna drive the car?
Robbie can drive.

Robbie doesn't have
the personality for driving.

I'm too sensitive.
You're too full of shit is what you are.

George!
Then you drive it.

It would not be appropriate
for me to drive it.

It's 1953, Mom.
Women vote now.

They smoke. They even
go to the bathroom by themselves.

You're becoming very crude, darling.

Your father's influence, no doubt.

Nice car.

<i>The only reason why I'm giving in...</i>

is because I know that
we'll be back here in a week.

It's time for your boy's medicine, ma'am.

Bernice has your medicine, George. Take it.
<i>It's not my medicine.</i>

I do not care whose medicine it is.

Just one of you take it,
and let's get out of here.

Good-bye, Bernice.

<i>I'll miss you.</i>
<i>Any parting words of advice for us?</i>

Yeah. Take the parking brake off.

<i>[Gears Grinding]</i>
<i>[Robbie] George! George!</i>

Please don't get us killed.
[Tires Screeching]

<i>[Narrating] My mother was</i>
<i>determined to teach my father a lesson...</i>

<i>even if it meant</i>
<i>killing us all in the process.</i>

<i>With that in mind, she told us</i>
<i>to drive around the city for an hour...</i>

<i>so she could teach me everything</i>
<i>she knew about driving a car...</i>

<i>which wasn't much.</i>
<i>[Brakes Screech]</i>

George, I almost stabbed myself.

You wanna drive?
That was a lovely stop.

You're a natural, darling.
Well, I think we're ready to go.

Anywhere in particular?
Boston.

Boston?
Mm-hmm.

For how long?
Well, with a little luck, forever.

What are we going to do in Boston?

We're gonna start a new life.

We are going to have fun, that's what.
My dear friend Julie Harper lives there.

Bette Davis was born in Boston.
Boston is a very elegant city.

It's full of museums and universities.

Tea parties.
Precisely.

Accelerate, darling.

Put the pedal to the metal, George.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What did you just do?
I was checking the rear view mirror.

Oh. Never, never look
in the rear view mirror, darling.

It makes no difference what's behind you.

I don't even know why
they put those up there.

Just look where you're going
and pretend that that's not even there.

Understood?
Yes, ma'am.

Now go.

<i>[Narrating] The whole drive up</i>
<i>to Boston, my mother and Robbie...</i>

<i>planned their upcoming adventures.</i>

<i>Around Hartford, her euphoria</i>
<i>was sounding a little forced.</i>

<i>It made me think.</i>
<i>By the time we got to Boston...</i>

<i>she'd proclaim this was all</i>
<i>a big misunderstanding...</i>

<i>and tell me to turn around</i>
<i>and drive us back to New York.</i>

<i>But she didn't.</i>

We'll stay here until
Julie returns from her cruise.

Mom, isn't this place a little...
Isn't it a little what?

Well, don't you think that
we should be saving our money?

Certainly not.
What an unpleasant thought.

Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh!
Oh, my goodness.

Are you okay?
I'm very sorry.

Oh, my goodness. Ann Devereaux.
Wallace...

Ann Devereaux.
Wallace McCallister!

<i>[Ann] Wally's an old beau of mine,</i>
<i>and he's divorced.</i>

He once asked me to marry him.

<i>He tried to kill himself when I turned</i>
<i>him down. Unsuccessfully, of course.</i>

Great. He deserves another chance.

Well, if that's the way you wanna put it.

So, is this the look
we're going for, Robbie?

I'm trying to find you a balance between
Dorothy Malone and Donna Reed.

Try this one.
I'm completely in your hands, darling.

You're like some predator.
I'm merely having dinner with an old friend.

Like the angler fish we studied in biology.

Never compare a woman to a fish, George...

or anything with scales for that matter.
Here. Try these.

They're perfect.

We're newcomers here, and Wallace
is a well-respected gentleman...

whose friendship will help
establish us in the community.

I got a feeling this is all gonna
come flying right back in your face.

<i>Nonsense.</i>
<i>Everything works out for the best.</i>

Always.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>
What?

[Laughing]
<i># #[Piano]</i>

Wallace, you haven't changed a bit.


Thank you.

Goddamn, Ann.

Why can't we just go back...

to the way everything was, huh?

Well, sometimes,
fate offers us a second chance.

<i>[Liquid Pouring]</i>
Mm-hmm.

<i>Wallace, is something wrong?</i>

Um...

Things are, um...

Things are bad for me, Ann.
They're bad.

Well, divorce is a terrible experience.

But sometimes, good things can come from...
from trials like ours.

I'm not talking about divorce.
I'm talking about... my business.

Oh, your business.
Yeah.

I've had a setback,
and-and-and l-I need cash.

Lots of cash, and fast.

Lower your voice, Wallace.

It's why I wanted to see you tonight.

Can you lend me some money?

Can I what?

75,000 would do it.

Dollars?
All right, 50.

Fifty. And I will get it back to you
by the end of the month, I swear to God.

It's not appropriate for you
to solicit money from me.

Appropriate? Appropriate my ass!

<i>I am broke, babe!</i>
<i>The wolves are circlin'.</i>

They're standin' in line
waitin' to take chunks out of my ass...

bigger than that flank steak you just had!

<i>[Slams Fist On Table]</i>
Sorry. I'm sorry.

Please excuse me while I powder my nose.

Okay.



Everything will work out for the best,
George Devereaux.

You'll see.

<i>It's not our policy to extend credit</i>
<i>to patrons we do not know.</i>

Oh. Well, is it your policy for your patrons
to be robbed in plain sight?

Madam, please.
Listen, I am the victim here.

I returned from the ladies' room
to find that my purse has been ransacked.

Madam, all I know is that
someone needs to pay for this meal.

Trust me, I already have.

Ma'am? May I be of assistance?

Well, who are you, cavalry?

Henry, I'll take care of that.
Harlan.

Harlan Williams.

We met at Julie Harper's
Christmas party last year.

Yes, of course. Harlan.
Well, Colonel.

<i>[George]</i>
<i>Why does he wear that uniform all the time?</i>

<i>Hasn't anyone told him the war is over,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake?</i>

<i>[Robbie]</i>
<i>Now that he and Mom are engaged...</i>

<i>I bet he sends us off to military school.</i>

<i>[George] I hate the way he calls me</i>
<i>Georgie boy all the time.</i>

<i>I hate the way he keeps</i>
<i>slapping me on the back...</i>

<i>like he's trying to dislodge a piece of meat</i>
<i>from my throat or something.</i>

If he touches my hair one more time,
I'm gonna kill him.

Holden Caulfield would tell him
what he really thought about him.

Holden hates phonies more than anything.

Holden Caulfield
is a fictional character, George.

You ever think about goin' back to Dad?

He's your father, not mine.

What was your father like?

I saw a picture of him once.
His pants were too short.

You think Mom is crazy?

I can't tell.
She's the only one I've had.

<i>Every time there's a picture</i>
<i>of a Communist in the school...</i>

he's always wearing a wool cap
and driving a tractor.

That's 'cause Stalin
killed all the designers.

That's why we're fighting
Communism, boys.

Because we're a country
that's founded on individualism.

Right, George?
Yes, sir.

Hell, if the Commies did take over,
everybody would be wearing the same clothes.

Every street would have
the same exact stores...

no matter which town you went to,
each the same as the next.

That's why our boys
are fighting and dying...

so that doesn't happen.


[Clears Throat]

[Both Snickering]

Did I say something funny, George?

It was nothing, sir.

They weren't laughing at you, honey.
They were laughing with you.

What was there to laugh <i>with,</i> George?

<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>I think you're overreacting, darling.</i>

Don't tell me I'm overreacting.

<i>Why am I so goddamn funny, George?</i>

Harlan.

Oh.

I'm sorry. I must be overtired.

It's probably just battle fatigue, sir.

Sorry about that, Georgie boy.

[Line Ringing]

Hello? Who is this?

Nicky, is that you? Hello?

it's the middle of the damn night.

Just hang up.
[Line Disconnects]

Dad, it's...
[Dial Tone]

<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>

<i>[Harlan]</i>
<i>Find anything interesting, George?</i>

No, sir. Good night, sir.
Sit.

I've gotta go.
<i>Sit.</i>

Sit.

You think of yourself as
the man of the family, don't ya?

My brother's older.
<i>Robbie's... Well, let's just say...</i>

that Robbie's not likely
to be the man in anyone's family.

I'm gonna marry your mother.

I know.
<i>That's going to make me the man of the family.</i>

<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>

It's like dogs, see?

In every pack,
there's a leader of the pack.

You've been that dog for a while.

Now, I'm going to be top dog.

<i>And there's always the dog</i>
<i>that challenges the leader.</i>

Things can get pretty nasty
till one of them wins.

Son, you can fight me...

but I guarantee you,
you're going to lose.

<i>You understand?</i>

Woof, sir.

So, what's Harlan
gonna wear for the wedding?

His uniform, I assume.

Does he sleep in that thing too?
George!

<i>Doesn't that just break your heart?</i>

We should buy them something.

<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>What a sweet idea.</i>

How much should we spend?
How much did Harlan give you?

$500.
Spend it all.

Oh, I can't, George.
That money has to pay...

for the caterers, the band, the flowers.

<i>And before that,</i>
<i>there's a rehearsal dinner.</i>

Look at them, Mother.

<i>Are you telling me that you spent all the money</i>
<i>I gave you on a bunch of crippled kids?</i>

I just couldn't help myself.

And you should've seen them, darling.
They were so happy.

I don't care if they were
shitting wedding bells.

You stole 500 bucks from me.

I didn't steal it, and I'll pay you back.

How are you gonna do that?
How are you going to pay me back?

<i>How?</i>
It was my idea.

<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>It was not your idea.</i>

I bet it was your idea, you little turd.

<i>It was my idea, and don't call him that.</i>

I'll call him any damn thing I wanna call him.
Now, give me back that necklace.

What are you talking about?
The one you're wearing.

The pearl necklace I gave you.
Give it to me.

Why?
I'm returning it for the money you owe me.
Give it to me.

I will not.

Give me that goddamn necklace!
Give me those goddamn pearls!
Oh!

<i>[George] Leave her alone!</i>
Come here!

[Screams]
Give me those damn pearls!
You hear me, woman?

Leave her alone!
I order you to give me those pearls right now!

<i>Damn it, stop! You stop!</i>

<i>If you touch my boy again...</i>

you miserable son of a bitch,
I will kill you!

<i>[Grunts Loudly]</i>
Oh...


<i># #[Rock On Speakers]</i>

You jumped on his back?

Your brother was so brave.

Are we going home now?

You know we can't do that.
Why not?

Because your father doesn't love me.
Why not?

Well, you'll have
to ask him that yourself.

We don't have any money left, do we?
<i>We have plenty of money.</i>

How much?

Enough to keep us until I find someone.

You mean, like, a husband?
<i>And a father.</i>

Does it worry you that the last one
you picked turned out to be a total psycho?

So, where's the next spot on the map?

<i>Where is that map?</i>

What's this?

It's mine.
Be careful, George.

Does he ever write you back?

Where's he gonna write to?
Howard Johnson's?

Well, what do you have to say
to your father anyway?
A lot of stuff.

Such as?
Guy stuff.

Women, guns, ice fishing.

Women.
What your father knows about women...

wouldn't begin to fill a postcard.

That man's all potatoes and no meat.

Let's just go.

Where to this time?
<i>[Engine Starts]</i>

[Ann] This is it here.
<i>[George Narrating] Next stop was Pittsburgh.</i>

<i>We were getting short on money,</i>
<i>and my mother knew that...</i>

<i>unless she found herself a husband fast...</i>

<i>she'd have to swallow her pride and head back</i>
<i>to New York, which would've been fine with me.</i>

I almost married a man in this city.

<i>You almost married a man in every city.</i>

Sarcasm is the refuge of scoundrels.

Gene Kelly was born in Pittsburgh.
Now I feel much better.

Suite 203.

Not so bad.
Yeah, look. Wall-to-wall floors.

Is that your car?

Yeah. It's a Cadillac Eldorado.

I know what it is.

How come you're staying here
if you're so rich?

We're not rich.

Well, your mom's pretty.
Is that her hair?

Whose else would it be?

I mean, is that her real color?

I guess so.
A lot of women color their hair.

Not me, though.

What are you doing here?
Mother's looking for a husband.

Anyone in particular?
Apparently not, no.

Where's your father?
He's a band leader in New York.

Like Ricky Ricardo?

Yeah. Yeah, like him.

Hey, Bud.

Lucy and little Ricky moved in next door.

This is my brother Bud.

Bud doesn't talk much.

Hello.
Nice car, ma'am.

Thank you.

<i>The automobile is seen</i>
<i>as a symbol of latent sexuality.</i>

<i>Sometimes male, sometimes female.</i>

Fins are often compared
to the lines of a raised skirt...

taillights to a sexual organ.

<i>Myself, I think the Cadillac is feminine.</i>

If you ever have any trouble with it,
I'll fix it for you.

We take it to a gynecologist.

<i>[Girl] Those are the most words</i>
<i>Bud's ever said at one time.</i>

Maybe in his whole life put together.

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i># Sail the sunlight sparkling on the bay #</i>

<i># #[Continues, Indistinct]</i>

<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>It's called a TV dinner.</i>

That's because it tastes like a TV?

It comes in that one little package,
and it practically cooks itself.

Maybe it could eat itself too.
Why don't we just go out?

No. We're poor now.
We're gonna have to drop out of school...

start working in the steel mills.

Oh, I love those boots they wear.
We have plenty of money.

We're just conserving is all. And I thought
it would be nice for us to sit around...

and share with each other
what we did during the day.

Just like a real family.
<i>[Robbie Chuckles]</i>

Now, who's got some good news to share?
I do.

I got the lead in the school play.
Good for you.

Well, who are you playing?
Othello.

That's wonderful.
Do you really think it's a good idea though...

to start your life
in Pittsburgh as a Negro?

George.
[Sighs]

Well, I've got some good news.

I ran into Oliver Pearson yesterday
at Kaufmann's.

<i>Who's he?</i>
He's an old beau of mine.

<i>He's invited me to</i>
<i>the theater Friday night.</i>

<i>His family makes Pearson sewing machines.</i>

It's your dream father, Robbie.


<i>[Woman On Screen, Indistinct]</i>

Doesn't work that way with me.

It's all lies, you know,
what they say up there.

It's all crap.
It's not crap.

Sure it is.
I can tell you how it's gonna end...

without even looking.

The bad guy's gonna get killed...

and the handsome guy
and the beautiful woman...

are gonna end up in love with each other.
They will?

Of course they will.

They always do.
That's what people pay for.

Maybe.

It makes people feel better.

It makes them think that
everything's gonna work out for them.

Everybody's looking for the American dream,
but it's a sucker's bet.

No, it's not.

You know, things might be bad sometimes...

but in the end, everything works out.

It always does.

Oh, yeah?
Who says that?

People.

You know, for someone from New York,
you're pretty stupid sometimes.

Mr. Lomax in 2-C said he'd give me
two bucks if I showed him my breasts.

He did?
Do you think I should?

I don't know.

Have you ever... seen breasts?

Sure. One.

You saw one breast?

I meant once. I saw some once.

Some?
Two.

I saw two once.


Do you wanna see mine?

Who, me? Now?

That way, you could tell me if you think
I should ask Mr. Lomax for more money.

Okay. Sure, yeah.

[Voices Continue On Screen]

You ready?

So how do they look?

All right. Good.

Fine. Of course, I don't have much
to compare them to, but...

I don't think you should show them
to Mr. Lomax.

Why not?

'Cause you're better than that.

<i>[Woman On Screen]</i>
<i>If I tell you something, you won't laugh?</i>

<i>[Man] I won't laugh.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Why don't you call Dad</i>
<i>and ask him for some money?</i>

In your dreams.
Then I'll go to New York and I'll ask him myself.

We do not need that man's help.

And I wouldn't take it if we did.

Oh, here.
Take this one.

Oh, thank you, darling. Perfect.
Mm-hmm.

Don't worry.
I will find you boys a father.

We have fathers, remember?
It's you who doesn't have a husband.

Then I'll find one of them too.
How?

Nobody's good enough for you.

No matter what happens in our lives,
there are standards we must maintain.

You ever think that maybe
you don't meet some of their standards?

And what would those be?

<i>Maybe you're not smart enough for them.</i>
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

Trust me, George. A woman never appears
more intelligent to a man...

than when she's listening to him.

[Ann Chuckling]
[Oliver Chattering]

Mmm. Mmm!
It was a lovely evening.

You know, Ann,
you are a beautiful woman.

Thank you, Oliver.

Come back to my place with me.

Oh, I can't. I have the boys.

They can take care of themselves.

I only wish.

No, honestly, I should go.
I had a very nice time.

And maybe...
Maybe...

Oliver... Oliver, please don't.

Come on, baby. Don't be a prude.
Oliver, no!

I said stop!

Just what the fuck do you think
I asked you out for anyway?

Conversation? Gosh. You go.
[Scoffs]

Get the hell out of here!
[Groans]

<i>[Car Door Closes]</i>

<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>$600.</i>

Those belonged to my grandmother.

Everything in here belonged
to somebody's grandmother, lady.

[Horn Honking]

Afternoon, Miss Devereaux.
Hello, Bud.

You're a long way from home.

Yes, I am.
<i>You're lookin' very pretty today.</i>

Well, thank you, Bud. You have no idea
how much I needed to hear that.

Can I give you a ride home?

Oh, l-I have to get some things,
but thank you.

Would you like to go for a drink later?

Not tonight,
but maybe some other time.

Yeah, maybe.

Bud saw your mom
coming out of a pawn shop.

So?

I took your advice.

<i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>
I told Mr. Lomax that
I wouldn't show him my breasts.

I told him he could see my finger
for a quarter though.

Come on.

<i>You coming or what?</i>

one of my oldest and dearest friends.

[George] What's wrong with him?
There is nothing wrong with him.

He's handsome as ever,
and he's still interested in me.

[Robbie] Oh, wow. I could live here.
George?

Promise you won't say
anything to embarrass me today.

I won't if you won't.
I have such good feelings about things.

How do I look?
You always look beautiful.

George, how do I look?
Ripe.

Where is this guy? Hmm?

I thought he couldn't wait to see you.
Charlie has other guests.

We can't monopolize all his time.

Why don't you boys go and mingle?

I love to mingle.

These are good. But don't put
the soft ones in your pocket...

or you'll squish 'em.

Enjoying yourselves, gentlemen?
Oh, yes.

Very much so. You know,
I'm playing a Negro in my school play.

Is that right?
Othello.

Ah. The noble Moor.

Verily. Perchance you could
give me some character notes.
Gladly.

[Children Laughing, Shouting]

Someone would think it was a...

Ann!

Excuse me a minute.
I got a beautiful woman to talk to.

<i>Annie!</i>
Hi, Charlie.

I see you found the place.
All I had to do was look
for the biggest house in town.

Uh-huh.

Hi.
And these must be your boys.

They certainly are.
You guys having a good time?

Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir."

I don't like the sound of that.
Makes me feel old.
Oh, Charlie.

You'll never be old.
<i>[Woman] Charlie.</i>

Harry says I can't drive the MG.
Yeah, because you can't.

Sweetheart, I want you to meet
one of my oldest and dearest friends.

Ann, this is Nancy.
Nancy, Ann.

Nice to meet you, Nancy.
My mother used to wear gloves like that.

Well, your mother must've been
a very elegant lady.

It's what women in her generation did.

Hey, a bunch of us
are gonna go dancing tonight.

<i>Why don't you join us.</i>
I have the boys.

Mom, don't worry about us.
We'll be fine. She's a great dancer.

Well, maybe your mother
could teach us to do the Charleston.

I could probably teach you
a lot of things, child.

<i>Come here.</i>

Don't pay any attention to Nancy.
Oh, no.

Look, um, I should be
at the William Penn at 11:00.

You and I could, uh, sneak off
and do some serious catching up.

That sounds like fun, Charlie.
Good.

<i>That's a lovely dress. Is it rayon?</i>

No!

You going somewhere, darling?

For a walk.

You're going to see
your father, aren't you?

So what if I am?

What are you gonna say to him?

That I wanna go back to New York
and live with him.

I'm not gonna let you do that, George.

<i>We can't stay here anymore.</i>
<i>We have no money.</i>

Darling, your father...

He doesn't want you.

He does too want me.
<i>You don't know him like I do.</i>

I know him better than you do, and I know
that he'll take me back in a minute.

George. I know
this has been hard for you.

But things will change soon, I promise.

How? How will they change?

I'm going dancing tonight
with Mr. Currell.

Mom. Listen.

Charlie Currell is not interested in you.

You know that for a fact, do you?
Yeah. Everybody knows that.

That girl he was with today
is closer to my age than she is to yours.

Don't say anything you'll regret.

You have two kids, for Christ's sake.
You're too old for him.

Isn't it obvious?

It is to everyone else.

<i>[Woman] #It's such a cryin' shame</i>
<i>to play the numbers game #</i>

<i># And barely know</i>
<i>the company you're keepin'#</i>

<i># You can take the tears #</i>

# Give me the golden years #

#The smiles that I'll be reapin'
while I know each night I'm sleepin' #

# I'll wake up to a friend #

<i># And another happy end #</i>

<i># Has begun #</i>

#With my one and only ##

[Applause]

Thank you. Thank you, Tanya.
Isn't she great?

<i>Folks, that was "My One and Only"hit.</i>

<i>[Laughter]</i>
Hey. Give me time.

Give me time.
One, two, three.

<i># #[Resumes]</i>

Can I help you, ma'am?
I'm meeting Mr. Currell.

I don't believe Mr. Currell's party
is here yet, ma'am.

But they usually head right up
to the Starlight Room.

Thank you.
I'll wait for him in the bar.

<i># #[Continues]</i>
<i>[Laughter, Chattering]</i>

Hey, kid.
What you doin' here?

We're living here now.
Didn't you get my postcards?

Well, yeah, sure I got 'em.
But I've been on the road.

You know how that is. Hey, Carl. Carl.
You remember my boy George.

Oh, sure, yeah. Hi. How are you?
This here's Tanya, our singer.

Hi, cutie.
And you know Nate.

Hey! How's it goin', George?
It's okay.

All right.
Hey, sit down. Sit down.

So where are you livin'?
In an apartment on the South Side.

Yeah? Nice place?
No, it's mostly working people.

That must rankle your mother to no end.

Imagine her livin' with the riffraff.

She's fine.
Good.

Hey, you want a Coke?

You got a Coke?
Give the kid a Coke.

I don't want a Coke.
What do you want?

I want you to take me back
to New York with you.

Take you back? Oh, man.

Son, I'd like to do that.
I really would.

But I'm on the road for, like, what,
five months at least.

After this, we go straight to Cleveland.
And after Cleveland, it's...

Hey, Carl, what's after Cleveland?
Chicago.

<i>Chicago.</i>
Five weeks.

Five weeks in Chicago.
And then, you know, who knows where?

Kansas City.
Kansas City.

After that, Dallas.
After that, Dallas. And Dallas...

And you'd hate Dallas, George.
I gotta tell you. What's after Dallas?

Phoenix.
Phoenix.

Okay. Forget about it.
I wasn't being serious.

I was just kidding anyways.
I'm gonna stay here.

So how you fixed for money?
We're running out.

Yeah? You know, I send your mother money
all the time. She sends it back to me.

She does?
Yeah.

So I stopped.
She got a job?

Oh, man!

What was I thinkin'?
Can you imagine Ann gettin' a job?

Your mother always thought
she was too good to work.

I hate to be the one
to break it to you, kid...

but your mother has got
delusions of grandeur.

No, she doesn't.
Mm-hmm.

She always figured she was some kind
of southern royalty, man, you know.

But you gotta take it from me.
In the real world...

class doesn't count for anything.

If it ain't in the bank,
it ain't anywhere.

Let me see if I got some...
Hey, Carl.

You got any money on you?
No.

Don't bullshit me, man.
Come on. Give me $100. It's for the kid.

I got some.
I don't want your money.

Wait. Hey, hey.
Come on, now. Don't be stupid, kid.

Take the money.
Don't be like your mother. Take it...

till she finds some other guy
to pay her way.

Did you ever love her?

Your mom? Yeah.

I loved her a lot.

You ever love me?
You're up in five!

I better go.
Wait, wait.

I still love you, pal.
You know, it's just...

I mean, with my life
on the road and all...

I was never cut out to be a father.

Just-Just like your mom
was never cut out to be a mother.

Yeah, well, at least she tries.

Yeah, she does try.

She loves you, kid.
Don't ever forget that.

See ya.

Hey.

[Clicks Tongue]
I'll see you, George.

I'll see you around.

You owe me a hundred, Dan.

<i># #[Piano]</i>

Thank you.
Ma'am.

<i>Paging Mr. Foster.</i>
<i>There's a call here for Mr. Foster.</i>

<i>Call for Mr. Foster at reception.</i>

[Chattering, Laughing]

When your old friend shows up, you can
dance with her once, but that's all.

I doubt she'll even come, doll.
She's got kids to take care of.

<i>Well, then it's probably past her bedtime.</i>
<i>You...</i>

[Elevator Bell Dings]

<i>[Man] All aboard!</i>
<i>[Man #2] We can all get in.</i>

<i>[Bartender]</i>
<i>Martini? Certainly, ma'am.</i>

Hi, there. I'm Ann.
Hi.

I'm Frank.

Hello, Frank.
Hello.

I hope you don't mind me
coming over here to talk to you.

Not at all, no.

I don't normally do this.

Ma'am.
Don't you?

I'm a little lonely tonight.
Are you alone too?

Yeah, I'm-I'm alone.

From out of town?
Well, originally, yeah.

So you're staying here at the hotel?

Well, actually, Ann,
l-I work at the hotel.

Oh, do you?
Well, what do you do?

I'm a detective.

And I'm arresting you for solicitation.

Prostitution.
[Laughing]

You had me going there, Frank.

I'm not kidding, ma'am.

[Chuckles]
Now, listen, you have a choice here.

I can either handcuff you
right here at the bar...

which would be very unpleasant for you,
for me and for the hotel...

or you can walk quietly with me to the back
while we wait for a police officer.

All right. Come on, doll.

[Line Ringing]
It's ringing.

<i># #[Up-tempo Jazz]</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

'Cause you know how he starts
playing something, and it's totally wrong.

<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
Hello.

Yeah. Who is it?

Hey, hey, hey! Hey, y'all, keep it down,
for Christ's sake.

Who is it, Dan? Another girlfriend?
Give me that thing.

Hello? H...

Give me that phone. Stop fooling around.

Yeah. Hello? Who is it?

Oh, well.
<i>[Replaces Handset In Cradle]</i>

[Line Disconnects]

There's no one there.

[Chattering]
Come on.

Come on.
No, wait!

Thank you.

I'd like to, um...

I need to explain.

You don't need to explain anything to me.

You just need to get home.

Thank you.

Well, good night.

Well, morning.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Oh, uh, Bud?

I would really appreciate it
if this didn't get around.

If what didn't get around, ma'am?


You're the most beautiful woman
I ever saw, Mrs. Devereaux.

You take care of yourself, ma'am.

Bud?

You're the first real gentleman
I've met since I left New York.

Where were you?
Car broke down.

What was wrong with it?
How should I know?

Bud fixed it. Ask him.
Where's your brother?

He had rehearsal.
Oh. Well, get your things together.

His too. We're leaving.

We're not goin' back to Dad now, are we?

You saw him, didn't you?

Yeah, I saw him, and he's a shit.

Don't talk like that about your father.

You'll regret it one day.

What do you care? Hmm?

It's pretty obvious that you're not
thinking about him these days.

I have been loyal to your father...

since the day I met him...

which is something no one would make
the mistake of saying about him.

That's what I said. He's a shit.

Your father adores you.

Right.

When you were two...

or maybe three years old...

you came down with something awful.

Like an earache or something.

Well, whatever it was, you were crying...

and nothin' anybody did
could make you stop.

Until your father came into your room...

sat down on your bed,
and started playing his clarinet.

He did?
Mm-hmm.

And whenever he would stop,
you would just start crying again.

So he just kept on playing nonstop
for what felt like days.

What happened?

You got better.

That's the biggest bunch of crap
I've ever heard.

There are some things
that you are too young to understand.

Such as?

Such as you're not the only one
who gets lonely around here.

<i>[Keys Jingling]</i>

George.

You guys leavin'?
Yeah.

They'll probably rent your apartment out
to some loser.

Probably will.

George, we should get going.

I'll see you around.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you around.

<i>[Starts Engine]</i>

George. Mirror.

Bye.

<i>[Robbie]</i>
<i>George, this is ridiculous.</i>

Is it a family tragedy, boys?

We're going to our Aunt Hope's
in St. Louis.

That counts as a tragedy.

Okay, everybody, let's, uh...
let's take five.

<i>[Ann] Thank you.</i>
The doctors have tried everything.

Eat up, boys. Breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

Especially when it's your only meal
of the day.

You sure Aunt Hope has room for us all?

Your Aunt Hope and Uncle Tom
have a comfortable if modest home.

<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin. How appropriate.</i>

Aunt Hope... the woman that God forgot.
[Chuckles]

Your Aunt Hope is a good person.

What happened,
did you run out of ex-boyfriends?

<i>[Robbie] You did say you'd never</i>
<i>go back there, remember?</i>

Well, I said a lot of things
that don't mean much now.

Why are we going there if you hate her so much?
I love my sister, George.

It's being near her that I hate.

Things will turn our way soon.
Now eat your food.

Looking for somebody?

Yeah. Ann Devereaux.

They left yesterday.

She say where they were going?

Who wants to know?
Her husband.

Your wife's a beautiful woman.

<i>She's got a lot of class.</i>

Yeah, well, I guess
I knew that before you did.

They're heading west.
Said something about her sister.

Thanks, pal.
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

<i>[George Narrating] My mother always said</i>
<i>she'd have to be desperate...</i>

<i>to go to her sister's in St. Louis.</i>

<i>So I guess we were officially desperate.</i>

Tom?
Ann? Is that you?

Hi, Tom!

Pull up around the back.

Where'd you get that car?
<i>[Ann Laughs]</i>

Hey, Hope, your crazy sister.

Robbie, you can have
half your Uncle Tom's pork chop.

Give him the meaty half, Tom.

All right.
And George can have my mashed potatoes.

I don't want your mashed potatoes, Aunt Hope.
Of course you do.

You're our guests,
and we're happy to feed you...

even if it is with the food off our own plates.
Thank your Aunt Hope, George.

<i>No need to thank me. You're family.</i>
<i>Good Christian people help their families...</i>

even when they do show up hungry
and without a word of warning.

Well, especially then.

So, from what you say, it sounds like you don't
even know yourselves where you're going.

The boys and I are on an adventure.

Oh.

I only wish Father were here to see where
his little darling is having supper tonight.

Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree after all, does it?

Guess not.
