(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CLOCK TICKING)
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

(DOOR OPENING)

Hey.

You're home early.

Yes.

I thought you were showing
a house today.

I canceled it.

Um. Is everything okay?

It will be.

I hope.

Did something happen to Anna?

No, she's fine.

So...

what's going on?

I know about you and Vivienne.

Who?

(PAPERS RUSTLING)

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

I can explain.
JESSICA: I don't want to hear your explanation.

I want you to listen to me.

Sit down.



You know, this is
not what it looks like.

Sure it is.

You've been fucking
a woman named Vivienne.

She's one of your
creative writing students.

Does she know you're married?

I'm so fucking sorry.

JESSICA: I'm gonna make this
easy on you.

I'm not divorcing you.

I love our family and I love
the life that we've built

and I'm not throwing it away.

We can get therapy.

JESSICA: First,

you will never
see Vivienne again.

Other than to tell her
that it's over.

Of course.
Second...

neither of us
will mention this to Anna.


Third, we're going
on a vacation.

A what?
JESSICA: A family vacation.

You, me and Anna.

Okay.
Our life, our... family,

it means more to me
than anything in the world.

Me too.

Now...

go pick up Anna
from soccer practice, please.

(JOHN BREATHING DEEPLY)
(DOOR OPENING)

(DOOR CLOSING)

I still don't understand why
I have to come with you guys.

'Cause you're too young
to leave at home.

ANNA: Are we almost there?

It's a surprise.

You know how I can tell
you picked this place

and not Dad?
JESSICA: Hmm?

Because it's hot,
it's in the middle of nowhere

and it's boring.

You know what they say, honey.
"There are no boring places.

Only boring people."
"Boring people."

That's right.

You know, if I were her age,
I wouldn't really wanna spend

a week out here either.

Well, thanks
for humoring me then.

No, I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

I'm sure you did.


JOHN: Hey.

I... I'm trying.

Try harder.

Whoa.

JESSICA:
Wait until you see the pool.

Holy shit.


No, but I mean, get real, Dad.
This place is huge.

JOHN: This is really
where we're staying?

I've been talking
about coming here for months.

I even showed it to you online
and said I wanted to visit.

You don't remember, do you?
Uh. Um.

Yeah, well,

the owner's selling it
and hired my agency

to handle the details.

It goes on the market
in a month.

In the meantime,
they're letting us stay.

They've been using it
as a rental.

I told you that too,
but you don't remember.

Who'd own a house
like this way out here?

Someone very rich
and very tired of other people.

Get the bags.

(DOOR UNLOCKING)

It's beautiful.

Not so boring now, is it?

ANNA: Is the person
selling this house

really old or something?

To be honest, I don't know
who owns this house.

It's part of a trust.

Two hundred acres of land.
(TOBY MEOWING)

JESSICA: Everything was done
through an intermediary.

They specifically asked me
to handle the listing.

ANNA: Come on, Tub Tub.
(MEOWS)

ANNA: Hi, baby.

JESSICA: (INHALES)
Don't let Tub Tub loose outside.

There are coyotes here.

Oh, can I pick my own bedroom?

JESSICA: Sure. They're upstairs.




I need to set up the camera
for the virtual tour.

JOHN:
Sorry about the floor. (EXHALES)




There's a store
about 20 miles up the road.

I saw a sign.

We can get groceries and wine.

I was thinking of cooking
veal cutlets tonight.

Or I could grill burgers.

Anna and I hate veal.

Great. (BREATHES DEEPLY)

Veal cutlets it is.


You know,
just 'cause I messed up,

don't be spiteful.

Oh.

I'm being spiteful?

I really don't know
what the rules are anymore.

Well, it was your idea
to come here.

And you're lucky

because the other
option's divorce

and I don't think that'd
work out too well for you.

Yeah, you would take Anna
and the money.

I've heard the threats before.
Then they must be true.

I hate this.

Same.

I need a drink too.

Go get food and wine.

Anna, come on.
Mom wants us to run an errand.

Oh, come on, I'm having fun.
JOHN: Yeah, I know.

Yeah, here.
(KEYS JINGLING)

ANNA: Need a little help.

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

(CHUCKLES, INHALES) Wow.

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)

Looks like we're
the city slickers around here.

We're city slickers
everywhere, Dad.

(JOHN SIGHS)

What? you're not gonna help me shop?
ANNA: Sorry, Dad.

Vintage fashion magazines
are more interesting.

Oh.
ANNA: What do you want me to do?

JOHN: Okay.
(ANNA CHUCKLES)

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)

Hey.

What you reading?

Nothing.

Where you from?

Houston.

Wow. That far?

(LIPS SMACKING) My name's Isaac.

I'm Anna.

You know what, Anna?

You look a lot
like my ex-girlfriend.

I do?
ISAAC: Yeah.

Way cuter, though.


Where are you
and your dad staying?

I saw you come in with him.

ANNA: My mom's here with us too.

They're not getting along.

They mean to you?

No. They're fine.

Um. We're staying at this big,
old house on the water

in the middle of nowhere.

I think I know it.
Uh. About 20 miles east?

Yeah, I think so.

So...

How old are you?

I'm almost 15.

Really? You look a lot older.


We should get
some ice cream sometime.

I'm 18. I'll drive.


(JOHN SIGHS)

(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

Who were you talking to?
Hmm?

You making friends over there?

Shut up.

Register's broken.
JOHN: Uh-huh.

Hey.

You wanna help me
bag these things up?

Yeah.

You know, your mom said
you'd like it here.

Didn't she also say to get veal?

Well, they didn't have any.

Oh, look at this.

Pop Rocks.

Those are nasty.

What are you talking about?
You used to love these things.

Yeah, when I was like ten.

Come on, Dad.
Hey, you know what?

Add those.

All right.

Comes to 58 dollars
and six cents.

That is 60.

Keep the change.

Thank you.

Oh, here, you got it.

(DOOR CLOSING)

(JOHN SIGHING)

Dad, you okay?

JOHN: Um.

Did that old guy
seem odd to you?

No, I don't think so. Why?

Maybe there's somewhere
closer to the house we can shop.

Oh, I don't mind
if we have to come back here.

(JOHN SIGHING)

(CAR DOOR OPENING)

(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

ANNA: Dad.
JOHN: Yeah?

ANNA: I got a weird question.
JOHN: Shoot.

(ANNA SIGHING)

Is everything okay
with you and Mom?

JOHN: Okay in what way?

ANNA: Don't do that.

JOHN: Don't...
Don't deflect.

That's what Mom does.
Can you just be honest?

Marriage is really hard work.

And sometimes, it doesn't go
in the direction you hoped.

Are you guys getting a divorce?
JOHN: No.

No. No, no, no.
ANNA: Don't have to freak out.

It's fine. I don't care.
JOHN: Who's freaking out?

It's just, like, all my friends'
parents are divorced.

JOHN: Listen.
It's not a big deal.

I...
Let's not think like that, okay?

ANNA: Well...

(BREATHES DEEPLY)
...I love you both.

I just want you to know.
JOHN: Good.

You know,
sometimes I think to myself,

"How did I get
such a wise daughter?"

(CHUCKLES)
And then I think,

"Wow, she probably has
a really wise dad."

Oh, I don't know about that.

Get out.
(ANNA CHUCKLING)

(TOBY MEOWING)
Maybe Toby needs a friend.

That'd be awesome.

(HAMMER POUNDING)

Mom?
JOHN: Jess?

(HAMMER POUNDING)
Mom?

(HAMMER POUNDING)
Jess?

(HAMMER POUNDING)

(JOHN CLEARING THROAT)
ANNA: Mom?

This... this fucking thing
won't open.

ANNA: Language.

Door won't open?
No, a manhole cover

in Lower Manhattan.
Yes, the door.


I have to get inside
for the virtual tour.

But don't you have a key?

Yeah, to the house,
the... the pool shed,

the mailbox,
but not for this door.

Jess, let... let me help.
(HAMMER POUNDING)

Let me give it a shot.

(SCREWDRIVER CLACKS)
(SIGHS) Okay.

(DOORKNOB CLATTERING)
(GROANS)

(DOORKNOB CLATTERING)

that thing's not opening.

Yeah.
Do you want me to kick it down?

Hmm. (CLICKS TONGUE) Not yet.

Did you get the veal?

They didn't have any.

JESSICA: So,
what did you get instead?

Burger meat
for grilling. (EXHALES)

ANNA: Let me see something.

No sunlight gets in.

That's weird.

This room
wasn't on the blueprint.

I... I think it's,
like, a storage room

or maybe a... a panic room.

Freaky.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

(DOORBELL RINGING)

I'll get it.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Can I help you?

ISAAC: Yeah.
So you're Anna's mom.

Who's asking?

Oh, I'm Isaac.
I'm... I'm a friend.

JESSICA: A friend of Anna's?

I met her at my grandpappy's
grocery store today.

Uh-huh. And?

Well, I was just stopping
to invite you

and your family to dinner.
(JESSICA CHUCKLES)

We're your nearest neighbors,
just a few miles that way.

That's very sweet of you, Isaac.

Um. (LIPS SMACKING)

I'm sorry, we have other plans.

We're on a family vacation.
I'm sure you understand.

I do. I do.
But if you change your mind,

we're having
veal cutlets tonight.

We got a lot in at the store.

Veal cutlets, at your store?

ISAAC: Yes, ma'am.

W... we got a huge
shipment in yesterday.

They're on display.
No one could miss 'em.


Give me your address, Isaac.

On second thought,
we would love to join you.

JOHN: <i>I'm telling you,</i>

I didn't see it.

Or maybe he's lying
about the stupid cutlets.

JESSICA:
He's not lying. You are.

Why would you trust
some stranger over me?


I didn't wanna say anything...

but the old man at the store...

he wrote this on my receipt.
Hmm.

"You're being watched
by the devil."

He's probably making a joke or...
I don't wanna have dinner

with some creepy locals
just so you can prove a point.

Well... (SIGHS) ...neither do I.

Okay, then.
Would you knock this stuff off?

Come on. You are beautiful.
What is wrong with you?

Why couldn't you buy
the veal like I asked?

I am telling you, I didn't see it.
JESSICA: Sure you did.

But you hate veal,
so you didn't buy it.

Because you do
exactly what you want

and damn the consequences.

You're not just
talking about veal.

Wow, what a genius you are.

(JOHN SIGHS)

You know, Anna hates veal too.

But you never think about her.

She's all I think about.

JOHN: Yeah?
Yeah.

I think she would be
very surprised to hear that.

So, now, I'm a bad parent?
Not you?

N... not the cheater.
Never you. No, no, no.

You're the nice one
and I'm the asshole.

Isn't that right?

Isn't that how
you try to manipulate Anna

into seeing us?

I'm not gonna stay here
and get emotionally abused.

Then go to your whore.

You know, at least
she made me feel good

about myself.

You make me feel
like slitting my wrists.

Then fucking do it.

You... (SOBS) ...broke my heart.

Oh, my God. (SOBBING)



(SOBBING) I'm your wife.
I know.

How could you
treat me like this?

How can you do this to us?

You're right. I am sorry.

I don't know
what's wrong with me.

(JESSICA SIGHING)

Did you end things
with that woman?

JOHN: Yes. It's over
between me and Vivienne.


On Anna's life.

Because this is why...

I brought us here.
I... (SNIFFLES)

I didn't want you
to sneak off to go see her.

I... I wanted you to give us
a chance to rebuild.

JOHN: I'm gonna get help.

I just... Oh, my God.

It's hard to trust you.

You just keep hurting me...
over and over.

I'm so sorry.

I want things to be
like they used to.

JOHN: Mm-hmm.

We're gonna be okay.

JESSICA: We're gonna be okay.

Mom! Dad!

JOHN: Wow.
(SNIFFLES)

Are you okay, hon?
Yeah.

I think it's finally stopping.
(EXHALES)

when she gets stressed.

(BREATHES DEEPLY) How do I look?

JOHN: Like a supermodel who got punched in the nose.
(CHUCKLES)

At least we have a reason to stay home tonight.
(ANNA SNIFFLES)

Yeah, well, that boy didn't give me a number to call and cancel.
His name is Isaac.

Who cares if we don't call and cancel?
His name's Isaac.

We can't just stand him...
(SNIFFLES)

...and his grandfather up,

especially if they're
cooking a meal.

JOHN: Okay, well...
Like, what if they mess with the house when we leave?

I'll go to the store
in the morning and apologize.

I don't want Isaac to see me
with a bloody nose, Mom.

I know, honey.
What if it happens again?

Okay.
We can have a nice dinner.

Just the three of us.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Oh. One minute!

(DOORBELL RINGING)


(KNOCK ON DOOR)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hi there, Anna's Mom and Dad.

JESSICA: What are you doing here?
(EXHALES) I'm real sorry.

I... I know you were supposed
to come to our place,

but the strangest
thing happened.

JESSICA: What's that?
Our oven died.

Seriously?
ISAAC: Yeah. So,

we did the next best thing.

We just brought the food
over here to cook for you.

It's... it's in the truck
with my grandpappy.

Hmm.

ISAAC: Uh. Veal cutlets,
onions, carrots, grits.

Grandpappy sure can cook.

Uh. We even brought
a bottle of wine.

It... it's just how
we do things on the bayou.

JESSICA: Hmm.
So, can we come in?

Uh. We'll even do dishes.

Ye... yes,
uh, of course you can.

Hey, Grandpappy,
they said it's okay to come in!

(TRUCK ENGINE REVVING)
(MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)

(TRUCK ENGINE STOPS)
(MUSIC STOPS PLAYING)

Great.

Come on in.


Thanks for cooking.

It's no big deal.

My name's John.

You know,
about that note you wrote me,

the one on the receipt.

I remember.

What did you mean by that?



(CUTLERY CLATTERING)

The little one.


Sometimes...

when a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

I don't understand.

Are you sure?

The devil is watching us
all the time.

Some of us invite him in.

Some don't.

I felt you needed
to hear those words, but...

didn't want to say 'em
in front of your daughter.

Well, no offense, but I don't
believe in the devil.

(PAN SIZZLES)

The devil believes in you.

Thanks. I appreciate that.

ANNA: His name's Toby.

We call him Tub Tub.
He likes you.

Cats can sense things
people can't.

Come on, Tub Tub.
Yeah, there you go.

Is that thing on?

No.

So, you were saying
it's just you

and your grandfather out here?

Yes, ma'am.
My parents died some time ago.

He raised me as his own.

How'd your parents die?
Anna.

Don't. It's rude.

It's fine.
I would be curious too.

Uh. They died of bone cancer.

Both of them?
ISAAC: Yes, ma'am.

Grandpappy says bone cancer's
the most painful way to die.

a lot of crazy things.

He's a wild one.

like around here?

Why? Are you wanting
to move here with Anna?

JESSICA: No.

ISAAC: I wouldn't
know much about schools.

Grandpappy taught me
everything I know.

But I'm gonna run
the store one day.

That's so cool.

You really think so?

Yeah.

I... I like your shirt.
It matches your eyes.

How old are you, Isaac?

Eighteen. I'm trying
to grow a beard. (CHUCKLES)

JESSICA: Hmm.
(ANNA CHUCKLING)

Who owns this house?
Do you know?

I don't know much about 'em.
They're never really here.

JESSICA: Really?

But being your closest neighbor,
I'd think you'd know.

JOHN: Hey, everybody,
dinner is almost ready

and it looks delicious.

This is great.

You are one hell of a cook.

There's nothing
my grandpappy can't do.

I bet your mom's
a hell of a cook too.


Um.

She's, uh... (MUNCHES)
No. That's okay, sweetie.

Uh. (INHALES)
Cooking isn't my forte.

It's just,
I never got interested in it.

Out here,
cooking isn't an interest.

It's a necessity.

ISAAC: We don't have
restaurants for miles.

You don't cook, you don't eat.

I know how to cook, Isaac.
It's just, uh,

not a passion of mine.

Hmm.

Everyone's got their passion.

Would you mind
if I light some candles?

No, uh...

that would be nice.

Isaac.
ISAAC: Yes, ma'am.

JESSICA: How did you know
where the candles are?


I'll be.

I guess cats
aren't the only ones

who can sense things.



Pretty funny thing to say, huh, Grandpappy?
(GRANDPAPPY COUGHING)


ISAAC: Gosh, you know...
(SNIFFS)

...uh, I don't have any matches.

Oh, um... (EXHALES)

...I'll find some
in the kitchen.

(CUTLERY CLATTERING)
John, come help me look.

I want these people
out of the house.

Look. (EXHALES)
Listen, they're weird,

but they haven't done
anything wrong exactly.

That creepy boy is looking
at Anna in a way I don't like.

Right.
And how did he know where the candles are?

Okay, listen,
we will finish dinner

and then we will tell them
we're going to bed.

Can't we get them out faster?

Hey, You're the one that said
we shouldn't piss them off.

Fine. (SIGHS)

I... I want them gone
the minute we finish eating.

I don't want Anna
alone with them.

Oh, shit, uh,
we forgot the matches.

Here, come on. I'll tell
them we couldn't find 'em.

ANNA: Mom, Dad, Isaac just did
something really cool.

What, he found matches?
No, he touched the candles with his finger

and they just lit up.
Can you do that trick again?

Oh, I'll show you
a lot more tricks, Anna.

Isaac, um,
John and I were talking

and we're grateful for the meal,

but we're really tired
after the drive

and we're going to bed early,
right after dinner.

And I... I just wanted you
and your grandpa to know.

You hear that?

They're inviting us
to stay the night.

No, I... I... I...
We're touched, ma'am.

No one's ever invited us to stay
in a house like this before.

I... I'm not inviting you
to stay the night. I'm...

I'm saying that
you have to leave after dinner,

if not sooner.

But we brought
ice cream for dessert.

Well, we'll eat it
when you're gone.

ISAAC: Oh, come on.

What did we do?

I know there's enough room
in this house for all of us.

Six bedrooms,
if I'm not mistaken.

That's not counting
the game room

or the bonus room...

or even that locked room
you can't get into.

How do you know
about the locked room?

How do you think?
(JESSICA GASPS)

You've been
in this house before.

Oh, girl, you got a gusher.

Mom, I don't feel good.

(GASPS) Oh!
JOHN: Oh, my God.

Whoa. Come on. Anna, Anna.
JESSICA: Oh. Get her.

GRANDPAPPY:
Oh, for Christ sakes.

I gotta use your pisser.

JESSICA: Anna.
Hey, baby?

Let's get her in the living room, okay?
JESSICA: Okay.

Anna.

Wake up. Wake up.
JOHN: Wake up. Wake up. Hey.

Hey.

Hey, are you okay? Are you okay?

Hey, sweetie.

JESSICA: Can you hear my voice?
JOHN: Can you hear me?

Your mom's here. I'm here.
JESSICA: You're okay.

ANNA: Mom.

What happ... what happened?

You fainted.
You had another nosebleed.

I have to wash my face.

Oh, it's fine.
I've seen blood before.

Much more than that.
You need to leave.

I'm not sure
you want that, ma'am.

She's very sure.
Our daughter isn't feeling well.

Dad, I'm fine.

No, hey. Isaac...
No, you're not.

...enough is enough. Come on.

It can take
Grandpappy a little bit.

Sometimes he gets the squirts.

Then go wait in the truck.
Mom.

It's okay.
ISAAC: Wow.

I feel like your cat's
the only one that likes me here.

You cook veal cutlets
for strangers

and this is the thanks you get?

You like me though,
don't you, Anna?

I can tell.

The way a woman likes a man.
Stop it!

You're done here,
Isaac. Get out.

I knew you'd have problems
getting into that locked room.

It's the only key.

(TOBY SQUEALING)

(DOOR OPENING)
(CLICKS TONGUE)

I think my grandpappy's
tangling with your cat.

Toby?


(TOBY SQUEALING)
ANNA: Toby.

Toby! Toby!
What the hell is going on in here?

JESSICA: Did you hurt our cat?
ANNA: No!

JOHN: Open the door.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

That door was open.
ANNA: Toby!

The cat ran inside.
ANNA: Toby.

Now, I may have
closed it by accident.

You're lying. This door
has been locked the entire time.

(TOBY MEOWING)
Grandpappy never lies.

ANNA: Toby. Toby. (SOBS)
Wait, you have a key to the room too?

(TOBY SQUEALING)
ANNA: Toby, Toby, Toby!

(BANGING ON DOOR)
JESSICA: Give me the key.

Give it to me.

ANNA: Toby! Toby!
Give me the fucking key!

This key?
Yeah!

Just give it to me.
JESSICA: Jesus.

ISAAC: Grandpappy,
he's hurting me. (GROANS)


(SIGHS)
See, John?

Told you I'd show you some tricks.
Huh?

(LIGHTS BUZZING)
JESSICA: What's going on?

ISAAC: Good thing
we have candles.

JESSICA:
Anna, honey, are you okay?

Take your grandson
and get out of here.

He's not my grandson.
JESSICA: What?

What do you mean, he's not your grandson?
(TOBY SQUEALING)

I mean, he's not my grandson.

JESSICA: All right.
(COYOTE GROWLING)

All right, you know what?
Just give me the key.

We're gonna take our cat
and I'm gonna call the police.

(BANGING ON DOOR)
(TOBY SNARLING)

ANNA: Something's hurting Toby, Dad!
JOHN: Okay, calm down.

ANNA: Something's hurting him!
JOHN: Calm down.

ANNA: Do something, Dad.
(COYOTE GROWLING)

(TOBY SQUEALING)
JOHN: Can't just open it up.

ANNA: Toby. (SOBS)

JESSICA: Oh, my God.
(COYOTE GROWLING)

(TOBY GROWLING)
(BONES CRACKING)

(JOHN EXHALES)

(LIGHTS BUZZING)
ANNA: (SOBS) Is Toby dead?

Listen, give me the key!

Check your back pocket.

Jesus Christ.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

I'll be.

JOHN: I'm opening it.
JESSICA: No, no, no. Stop, stop!

John, John, John, please. You have to stop.
JOHN: I'm opening the door.

Please stop. We heard...
JOHN: I'm opening the door.

There's something in there.
ANNA: Mom,

Toby's in there!
There is something... I know,

but there
is something else in there.

We all heard it. Please don't...
Could be a coyote went in there,

you know,
when the door opened.

Oh, coyote.

Now, that is bad news
for Tub Tub.

JOHN: No, no. Enough's enough!

I'm opening the damn door!
No, please don't!

Don't open the door.
Back off!

Are you out of your mind?
Please, John, let's...

JOHN: Come on!
JESSICA: Let us go.

Let's go.
ANNA: Open the door. Dad, open the door.

Damn, I must have brought
the wrong key.


Can we go, please?
(SOBS)

Can we go? Oh, my God.
Mom, we can't go! We can't just leave Toby, Mom!

JESSICA:
Listen to me. It's a cat.

We will buy another cat.
(SOBS)

(GRANDPAPPY CLEARS THROAT)
JESSICA: We will.

Grandpappy,
did you find that bathroom?

We have to get out of here.
Yeah. Through there.

Of course. I remember now.

Uh. Sorry about your cat.

JOHN: Fuck you.


GRANDPAPPY: Listen,
you need to come with me.

We need to talk
before Isaac gets back.

(ANNA SOBBING)
GRANDPAPPY: Follow me.

JESSICA: Come here. Come here.

(ANNA SOBBING)
JESSICA: We have to go. We have to go.

(ANNA SNIFFLING)

JOHN: <i>So, are you robbing us?
Is that what's going on?</i>

You ain't got nothing
we need or want.

Then why are you here?

Like I told him...

when a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

You are nuts and so is that kid.

Bad things?
(JOHN EXHALING)

Bad things like what?

Like lying.

Cheating.

Murder.

Ain't you read your <i>Bible?</i>
Oh, God.

In the store,
Isaac was so nice to me.

(SIGHS)
ANNA: He said I looked like his ex-girlfriend.

Now, he's being so mean.

GRANDPAPPY: (SIGHS) Yeah, well...
(JOHN SIGHING)

...that's Isaac in a nutshell.

JESSICA:
If Isaac isn't your grandson,

then who is he?

sort of appeared one summer.

Walked right out of the bayou.

Said his parents had died,
left him a bunch of money.

his last name.

But he didn't have
no place to live.

Didn't have no possessions.

So I kinda, sorta, took him in.

You took him in?
Stop!

I'm not done talking.

(EXHALES, INHALES)

He ain't got no education...

but he's got
a good Christian spirit.

I... I guess
I'm his helpmate, so to speak.


How long has he lived with you?

GRANDPAPPY: It's hard telling.
You lose track of time

out on the bayou.


Maybe decades.

There's no way.

Thing is...

he don't never seem
to get any older.


He's good with those damn
magic tricks, though, isn't he?

But he always looks
the same to me.

Maybe 18 or so.

This is bullshit.
Just let him talk.

No, it's bullshit!
JESSICA: Let him talk!

I'd like to put some music on.

Make sure Isaac can't hear.

I got something else
to tell you.




(BREATHES SHAKILY)

VIVIENNE ON STEREO:
<i>So, what are you telling me?</i>

<i>You telling me that
she found out about us?</i>

JOHN ON STEREO:
<i>I wasn't careful enough.</i>

<i>I was so stupid about it.
Yes, she followed me, okay?</i>

<i>I just found out about it.</i>

<i>She could be watching us right now.</i>
Well, that ain't the song

I was looking for.
VIVIENNE: <i>I can't believe she knows.</i>

JOHN: <i>She's dragging me
on a trip with Anna. I...</i>

What is this? Wh... what is this?
JOHN: <i>God, I fucked this up.</i>

VIVIENNE: <i>It's gonna be okay.</i>
JOHN: <i>I'm telling you,</i>

she is vicious.

You have no idea. (SIGHING)

I have to be
more careful from now on.

Everything will be different
when I get back, Vivienne.

I will file the divorce papers,

and we can start
our new life together.

No, no, no, no!
Yes, yes.

JOHN: No.
GRANDPAPPY: Yes.

JOHN: Come on.
It's okay.

Jessica, please.

I don't know what's going on right now.
VIVIENNE: <i>I love you so much.</i>

JOHN: <i>I love you more.</i>

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

How did you get that?

I think it's one of Isaac's magic tricks.
JOHN: Listen.

Fuck your magic.

Was that real?
(SOBS)

That was real. That was real.

seeing Vivienne.

Yeah? Yeah?

And you... you...
you're going to... to...

you're going to divorce me?

I... No.

I said that to her,
but I didn't mean it.

My God. (SOBS)

You've been playing
both of us this entire time

and you've been lying to me.

I can't believe this.

No, hey, listen,
don't get emotional.

I can get however I want.

Not in front of Anna.
Not in front of Anna? You're a piece of shit.

(ANNA SNIFFLING)

Dad, are you leaving me and Mom?


JOHN: I'm gonna kill you.
(CHUCKLES)

Look.

<i>Greatest Hits</i>
<i>of Gene Allison.</i> See?

No. You're a liar
and so is that boy.

You're doing this
to mess with me.

Anna and I are gonna
leave right now.

JOHN: Please don't.
You... you're disgusting.

JOHN: Please don't.
You see this?

Go to hell.

Yeah, I'm divorcing you now.

(ANNA SNIFFLING)
We're done.

Listen to me...
JESSICA: I'm out.

...Jessica!

Come on. I want you to get up. Get up.
No, you can't leave Dad.

Jessica!
JESSICA: I'm out.

(ANNA SOBBING)
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

Toby?


JOHN: Wait. I figured it out.

Other than Anna...

you're all in on this,
aren't you?

In on what?
JOHN: In on this.

You're all working together,
aren't you?

You and the old man,

both have keys
to the locked room.

And you,

you already know these people
and you paid them.

You set me up
and taped me somehow

and now, you're getting
your sick revenge.

You don't want
to rebuild our marriage.

You want revenge.

You're crazy.
JOHN: You know, I knew you were vicious

(SOBS)
JOHN: I knew it,

but I didn't know
you were a psychopath.

How could you do this to Anna?
(ANNA SOBBING)

I've never met
these people before in my life.

I'm calling the police on you.

Call them. Call them right now.
JOHN: Wait, wait.

Who took my phone?

Where is my phone?
ANNA: Stop, Dad! Stop!

Maybe it was Vivienne.

Maybe... maybe she's the one
that set you up.

Did you ever think about that?

And you're a lying,
cheating asshole

and she's probably
exactly like you.

You're the one who followed me,
who stalked me.

Exactly. What if she's doing
the same thing?

Please stop! (SNIFFLES)

Before you played that...

record...

what were you going to say?

I was gonna tell you
that there's something

you need to see
in that locked room.

(SCREAMS) Holy shit!
JOHN: What?

Someone's out there.

JESSICA: Where?

I saw something by the water.

ISAAC: Could be a coyote.

Yeah, could be. Or maybe a wolf.

Even a wild dog.

(COYOTE GROWLS)
There!

I don't see it. Where are you looking?
No, I saw it.

I saw it too.
(SIGHS)

Probably just a coyote.
Or a wolf.

Better to be safe though.

Good thing
this gun's still here.

Whoa.

Don't worry.

If you're righteous,
you'll survive.

Just be careful, please.
(SIGHS) Wait.

How's this camera work?

(CAMERA BEEPS)
<i>Look, Grandpappy.</i>

<i>I'm a movie star.</i>

Don't put me on that.
(CHUCKLES)

JESSICA: Isaac.

Isaac, what is it that you want?

(ISAAC CHUCKLES)

I want you to take
real good care of this camera.

<i>I'm gonna be famous one day.</i>

<i>Just like Charles Manson.</i>

you hear about God's son.

Does Satan have a son?

(STEREO STATIC)
Food for thought.

("TELL ME THE TRUTH"

Please put that gun down.

Let's go outside, John.
No.

Why not?
Because you're gonna shoot me.

Shoot you?

<i>â™ª Tell me the truth... â™ª</i>
(SCOFFS) I thought we were gonna go hunt coyotes.

We can talk about this.
Can we talk about this, please?

Will you please
put that gun down?

Please?
Jessica.

Fine.

I'll leave the gun
with Grandpappy.

You can stay here
with your wife

and your daughter.

<i>â™ª If you will only

Okay, John. No gun.

Let's go for that walk.

John.
No, Dad. Dad.

Just stay here.
It'll be all right.

ANNA: Don't go.
It's okay.

Don't go, Dad. Don't go.
I know. I know.

It's okay.

(ANNA SOBBING)

<i>â™ª And I just don't understand â™ª</i>

(MUSIC FADING)

This wasn't the deal
we made. (GRUNTS)

No, listen,
all you have to do is rob us

and shoot Jessica.

What the fuck
are you doing in there?

What the fuck are you
pushing me for?


How did you get that recording
of me and Vivienne?

Oh, magic.
JOHN: Yeah?

Yeah.
I have to look squeaky-clean

and you have to be believable
for Anna's sake.

Oh, I'm not believable?

They don't know I'm 21,
that... that I was in the army.

But you keep fucking up my plan.

I'm fucking up?

I'm not the one
trying to murder my wife.

Don't say that.

Murder? Murder.
JOHN: Don't say that.

Don't say that.
ISAAC: You don't like that word.

Murder. Murder.
Don't say that. Don't say that.

Don't say that.
Don't say that, Isaac.

Get off of me.
(JOHN GROANS)


JOHN: This was the perfect plan.

I knew that
she would drag me here.

She babbled
about this stupid house nonstop.

I spent so long strategizing
and finding you.

ISAAC: Yeah.

It's not easy finding a killer for hire.
(JOHN SIGHS)

You gotta visit
some pretty dark places.

I'm not gonna pay you
if this thing goes sideways.

(SIGHS)
Oh.

Yeah, 'cause you'll be in jail.

JOHN: Well, so will you.

Along with that crazy, old man
you work with.

He's never
gonna see daylight again.

You're gonna see
the electric chair, bub.

You're the mastermind here.

We're just country folk.

What happened to our cat
in that locked room?

Maybe a coyote killed him
and I brought him back to life.

This is what
I'm talking about.

You quit scaring people
with this voodoo shit

and do your job.

This is my job.

Okay.

Keep the train on the tracks
and you'll get your 100 grand.

Then you can take the car
to Mexico, like we planned.

you're trying to control me.

(JOHN SIGHS)

You want your wife gone,

you want a good story
for your kid,

for the cops
and your shiny, new girlfriend.

That takes work.

That takes trust.

Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

We can call
this whole thing off right now.

No, we are doing it,

but from now on,
play by the rules.

Okay.
JOHN: Okay.


rob us,
and when we're walking back

to the locked room,
you shoot Jessica in the head

and then you get the fuck out.

Okay.

JESSICA: (INHALES)
They've been gone so long now.

some music on again.

JESSICA: No.

No, it's okay.


What's... what's your real name?

Grandpappy's fine.

Grandpappy. Grandpappy.

I wanna ask you something.

Yeah?

I think there's something
wrong with Isaac.

I think that he is... evil,

and he wants to hurt people.

Yeah, some days,
I think that too.

But you're not like him.
GRANDPAPPY: Hmm.

Not from what I can tell.

So...

I'd like to make a proposition.

A proposition?
JESSICA: Yes.

Let me and my daughter go.

We'll sneak out.
Isaac won't see us.

We'll get in our car
and drive away.

What about Dad?

Quiet.

You'll go to the police.

that you're innocent.

I'll say that you're a hostage
just like us.


Well, I think Isaac
is making you do this.

I know he is.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)
I can't turn my back on him.

JESSICA:
If you let us go, I will...

I will give you
everything I have.

Mom, what about Dad?

We can't just
leave him here to die.

GRANDPAPPY: Hush.

They're almost back.

JESSICA: Oh, shit. (EXHALES)

I can't believe
you wanted to leave Dad.

Don't tell him I said that.

(DOOR OPENING)

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

We didn't see any coyotes.

But we did some talking.

Ma'am, your husband's right.

We're robbing you.

Me and Grandpappy
are gonna lock you in that room.

See, we've been sneaking
in this house

for a few weeks now.

Thought you were
the new owners.

Just bad luck, really.

Like bone cancer.

You're gonna lock us
in the room?

ISAAC: Yes, ma'am.

After we take
your money and your SUV.

That was their plan all along.
But we'll die if you lock us up. How... how will we get out?

We'll call the police,
leave an anonymous tip.

I'll leave some food and water in there for you.
(SNIFFLES)

Thank you. I trust them.

You're a fucking idiot.

They are not
gonna call the police.


My daughter is 14 years old.
(SNIFFLES)

Please, I'm... I'm asking you,
please don't do this.

Ma'am, you have my word.
JESSICA: Your word?

Your word doesn't mean anything.
Calm down, okay?

Your word means even less.
Why the fuck would I calm down?

JOHN: Jess.

It's the room or a bullet.

(ANNA SOBBING)



It's okay.

(JESSICA SIGHS)


ISAAC: Time's wasting.

What is this place?

Why are you doing this?

Why are you doing this?
I think we just have to put our differences aside...

(SOBS)
...and do what they...

Don't talk to me!

You first, John.

Me?

I'm gonna kill you!


Open the door!

I'm gonna fucking
tear you apart.

(JOHN SCREAMING)

See, ma'am,

I'm guessing he's cheated on you
many a times before

with many different women.
(JOHN GROANING)

But you always take
him back, don't you?

What is he talking about?
I... I... I don't... I don't know.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)
JOHN: Anna...

Hey, baby.
Don't listen to Isaac.

Don't listen to him.

think you're doing?

Listen, he's a liar.

If he says anything about me,
you know he's lying, okay?

Okay? Same with your mother!

Same with your fucking mother!

You.

Oh, my God.

You're his wife.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. I... I got a text.

(INHALES)
From my husband?

Yes.

You knew he was married?

You're as bad as he is.

I'm really, really sorry.

I am. He... he told me that
he was here all alone here,

that he needed me
to come right away.

See? I drove
as fast as I could.

My husband didn't text you that.
VIVIENNE: What?

This house is being robbed.

The men are still inside.
They have John locked up.

Are you serious?
JESSICA: Yes. My daughter's inside too.

They took John's phone
and texted you to lure you here.

Why?
To hurt you. They're crazy.

They have a gun.
Okay, well... well, I'll help however you need, okay?

I'll... I'll call the police.
No, phones don't work. Do you have anything

I can use as a weapon?
I don't know, a knife?

Mace. Mace.
Give it to me. Give it to me.

VIVIENNE: Okay.
You need to go to the police.

Tell them that we are
being held at gunpoint.

There's an old man
and a teenage boy.

Is John okay? Anna?

Do not use my daughter's name.

You disgust me.

I actually came here to break up with John.
I don't give a shit.

You can have him.
He told me all of this...

JESSICA: Shut up.

From now on,
my family is me and my daughter.

If you don't come back here
with the police and I survive...

I swear, I will find you
and I will kill you.

I'll get help. I swear.

Go.

I was in this for the money?

Isaac's controlling this,
isn't he?

But why?

Maybe he didn't have
nothing better to do.

It's so heavy, Mom.

know about it.

We can disappear into the bayou.

See, your husband hired me

That's not true.

we were just country folk.

in the wrong direction,

I set 'em straight.


Me and the old man
built this house

for people just like your husband.
(ANNA SOBBING)

ISAAC: Murderers,
liars, cheaters

and sinners are all alike.

They're drawn to it
like a magnet.

It's my task to kill 'em.

You're insane.

I've been alive for centuries.

Maybe I'm a demon.


Or just a really confused kid.

(PANTS)
(ANNA SOBBING)

(ISAAC GROANING)
(SOBS)

(BREATHES SHAKILY)

Here.
(KEYS JINGLING)


(GROANING, PANTING)

Anna. (PANTS)


Honey, Isaac's dying.

I'm fucking scared, Mom.
We have to go.

Go. Go! We have to go.
(ANNA SOBBING)

JESSICA: Everything's
gonna be okay. Run. Run! Run.

Run. Run. (PANTING)

(COYOTES HOWLING)

(PANTS)
(ANNA SOBBING)

(CAR ENGINE REVVING)
(PANTS) Thank God.


Check your phone.

Check your phone
right now, please.

(SOBS)
Do you have a signal?

I don't have any.
Why isn't it working, Mom?

It's not working.

Did Isaac hurt you?

Did he... did he touch you?

No.
No? (SOBS)

ANNA: (SOBS)
We left Dad there, Mom.

We have to go back.
What about Dad, Mom?

What about... what about Dad?
JESSICA: What about Dad?

Listen to me. We're safe.

That's what matters.
That we're safe right now.

We're safe.

And I keep telling you,
there are no houses out there.

Not like the one you described.

Yeah, something went wrong
with my phone and my computer

and the pictures
aren't there anymore.

It's not like
I don't believe you.

We were inside that house.
I was the real estate agent.

The house is real
and we need to find it

and my husband.

And we need to find Isaac
and... and the old man.


It's easy to get confused on the bayou.
We're not confused.

Isaac tried to kill us.


Like I said,
deputies will be dispatched.

Listen, I don't know
what really went on

between you and your husband,

but if he's out there, we'll find him.
(ANNA SOBBING)

He's probably just disoriented.

He may still be alive.

You haven't heard a word I said.

I heard you,
but you're not making any sense.

Take me to this address.

I wanna to see it myself.
(ANNA SOBS)

There are no homes around here.
It's just swamp.

I'm ready when you are.

And my daughter's
gonna stay here in the station.

Mom...

It's safer
if I leave you here.

Like you left Dad?

Is he safe?

I promise, I will be back
in a couple hours.

(ANNA SNIFFLING)


I swear, there was a house.

It was... it was a big house.

Uh. And there was a fire
in... in the driveway.

Where?

It was there.

It was... it was...
it was right here. (SIGHS)

Like I said,
it's easy to get confused.

I... I'm not confused. I'm not.

Then you tell me,
are we at the wrong place?

No. (SIGHS) I don't know.


Look, I'm happy to take you
somewhere else, within reason.

It happened here.


You're right.

There's nothing here.

There's no house.

I'm sorry, ma'am.

JESSICA: Take me
back to the station.

You know, to be honest,
you're not the first person

to come to me
with a crazy story

about a house.

Can you drive faster, please?

First, I need you
to do me a favor.

JESSICA: What?
Open the glove compartment.

Oh, my God.

But this was in the house.
How did you get it?

That means
we have Isaac on tape.

Turn it on.
(CAMERA BEEPS)

(JESSICA GASPS)
<i>We're right behind you, ma'am.</i>

(JESSICA GASPING)

Oh, my God.

(RADIO STATICS)
Turn this off.

("TELL ME THE TRUTH" PLAYING)
It's on all the stations.

That's not...
This can't be happening.


<i>â™ª Tell me the truth â™ª</i>
(CAR HORN HONKING)

<i>â™ª Please stop me from guessing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Darling, it will be
A blessing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you will only
Tell me the truth â™ª</i>

(MUSIC FADING)
(RADIO STATICS)

It was... them.

Take a breath.

It's not real.

No, it can't be.

Isaac and Grandpappy
help us keep order.

I don't know what they are.
They're not human.

You're crazy.

DEPUTY TORRES: We protect Isaac,

and he takes care
of the evildoers.

Like a spider catching flies.

He sends them straight to hell.

It's an illusion.

DEPUTY TORRES:
Tell yourself that.

The bayou plays a lot of tricks.

I'm gonna tell everyone
what happened.

DEPUTY TORRES:
Who would believe you?

Isaac doesn't hurt
the righteous, only the wicked.

But I'm not wicked.

It's a matter of degrees.

Heaven and hell
are a choice away.

Isaac gave you
a second chance. Embrace it.

Be kind.

And never come back
to the house on the bayou.

Anna?
ANNA: Mom.

Anna.

Oh, thank God. (SNIFFLES)

It's okay.
(ANNA SOBS)

JESSICA: I love you.
(SOBS)

JESSICA: Oh, honey.

I'm never leaving you again.

(ANNA SOBS)
