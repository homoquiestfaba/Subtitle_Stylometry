No, he's ordered the four generals that

To Shakespeare.
[One] Mm.

To Bill.

I think you both just spoiled the end.

No.

We didn't.


Rovach.
No, I was talking to her.

Do you mind? I can feel the tip.

Yeah.

He's no longer inside me. We're safe.

[bartender chuckles]

What is your name?

Arianna.

Arianna.
Big guy's still staring at me, isn't he?

Yeah.
He's gonna kick my ass later.

Good.
Yeah.

'Cause the chocolates have lasted

[giggling] That's crazy.

I'm getting old.

[Arianna snorts]

Do you believe what that man said?

Evil goes unpunished.

I believe he believes it.

And what about you?

I just feel like the whole world's,

But he'll get his.

[inhales deeply]

You know, this was fun.

Are you ghosting me?

Do I look like a ghost to you?

No. It's like the things you say,
it sounds like you want to be.

The things I say.
Mm-hmm.

But what makes you think
that I want to see you again?

[both chuckle]

You weren't that memorable.


Besides, I'm moving to New York.

[chuckles]
Mmm.

That's where I live.

Sucker.

So, now you're stalking me?

Maybe a little bit.

He's obsessed with this <i>Beaver </i>show.
I think he's an orphan.

We got a little bet on

It's an interesting crew
you got here, bro.

How many missions you guys run?

Counting Florence?
Yeah.

One.
One what?

Actually, no, there was, um,
this, like, mini-mission,

so maybe one and a quarter.
It was in Sicily.

But Florence, absolute shitshow.

I mean, if I wasn't there,
probably more than one of us dead.

That's all I'm saying.
Are you fucking kidding me?

I don't fuck around.

You realize I just buried myself
in front of my family and friends?

Yeah, One told me about that.

Big military funeral.

Guns popping, flags.

It's pretty cool. At my funeral,
there was five people there,

and two of them left before the end.

It is tough watching
your mum cry at your grave.


This mission, I got a good feeling.

I got a really good feeling
about this mission.


I don't know. One can usually find anyone,
but he just can't seem to find him.

You don't know my brother.
Rovach is a monster.

He'll violate every single principle

I begged the director

The Americans caught him years back

You like him though, One, yeah?

He's definitely an arsehole,

No.
Well, he likes you.

[Two, in Turkmen]
You're the last living general...

[general 4, in English] It's too late.

The deal is done.

Two tons of sarin gas.

Where are you keeping Rovach's brother?
What?

You got three seconds. Be specific.

No, don't think, don't think. Talk!

Three, two...

Ni Hai Tower, uh, in Hong Kong, penthouse.

...one.

[woman gasps, whimpers]


You know, he could've finished.

Good work. I said undercover,

I hate this town. I really do.

No, it's Navratilova.

One promised my soul back.

I just gotta talk to somebody.

You're scared.

You're such a pussy.

Ever stage a <i>coup d'Ã©tat?</i>

No. No, I don't even know what it means.

Oh, wow. A coup. A <i>coup dâ€™Ã©tat.</i>
It's French, Napoleon.

French history stuff.

Okay.

You can't tear a place down

until you have someone
to build it back up.

That someone is Rovach's brother, Murat.

Imprisoned in Hong Kong.

You see, the army's fucked
now we killed the generals.

They will look for a new leader.

And we're gonna give them one.


"Coup." I don't even know what it means.
Stupid word.

Oh, my favorite.

I know, Mama. How you doing?

Well, you see, Ma...

there's this country, Uzbekis...
No, Turg...

Turkis... Turkikas...

Fuck! Turkikasazhan?

Ma, all I know is that it's got a "stan"
at the end,

and it's in Asia.
Oh, by Kansas!

Ish. Yes, Mama, by Kansas.

Anyway, the man who ran it died,
and, uh...

he... he left behind two sons.

One good and one bad.

And the bad one came out on top.

So, what the fuck are you looking at,
Nurse Ratched?

Huh?

Go hang with the fucking nuns
or something.

Yeah, walk.

Walk.

I will fucking knock you out
in front of my mother.

[exhales sharply]

Sorry, Mama.

Anyway, the two sons fought,
and the bad one came out on top,

so he locked the good one up, and...

I never liked Diego.

Yeah, me either, Mama.
Working for him didn't agree with me.

But I work for someone else now, Ma.
We're doing good things.

Huh? We're fixing
what's going on in Kansas.

Good things can erase the bad ones,
right, Mama?

I love you, Andres.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

No, Ma, Andres is in Bogota.
It's me, Javi.

Javi.
Javi?

I won't speak to Javi anymore

I don't usually stand on ceremony,
but today,

what just befell your superiors
in America

undid over 60 years of loyal service
to my family.

of your predecessors,

but if my generals' shoes
are to be filled,

I need men like you.

Like you,

but not you.

No.
[Seven] Okay.

[Three] Then don't.


Who is he?

Yeah, but how did you meet him?
We didn't.

He met us. In really weird ways.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Very weird,

Hey! Hey! Calm down.

What are you? Are you a fucking pig?

Are you afraid?

Never.

There's power in that.

More power finding a cause.

Something so important
that you're afraid to lose it,

afraid that you're gonna die
some other way.

For nothing...

instead of what you're fighting for.
You're making a mistake to do this.


I've been robbing my whole f...
I can make you money.

Are you afraid?
I've got skills.

I can be useful. I can help you.
You're gonna die now.

I can fucking help you!
Gonna fucking die now.

If you're gonna do it, fucking do it.
You die now!

Fucking do it!



Oh, my God!
You sick fuck! Who fucking does that?

You should have seen your face.
You sick fuck!

It's not fucking funny!

It's really funny.

more screwed up than mine.

he's not coming back for you.

but I'm a nosy dude.

So, here goes.

You could have fought a million battles.

Why now... and why Turgistan?

Everybody talks about helping.
It's nice to actually do something.

[suspenseful electronic music playing]

It is quite the view, little brother.

Personally, I'd prefer more gold,
you know.

Black.

I'm alone.
Closing on you, it's, like, dark.

You know Sultan Ahmed I?

That shit.

gave a gift to his younger siblings.

Magnificent wing in Topkapi Palace.

The gilded cage.

Yeah, I've learned my history, too.

Would you prefer the sultans before Ahmed?

Who strangled the younger brother
with the same silk sheets?

You have your own library, screening room.

Yeah, it's a fun prison.

And this, what is... what is this?

Art.

Ugly art.

And the occasional visit
from a loving brother.

Quite generous after you tried to take
what was rightfully mine.

The throne is not yours or mine.

It belongs to the people.
The people?


Like they're some sacred body.

Instead of a violent, ignorant,
illiterate mob who just begs for the whip.

He's got his anger issues.

What are you doing here?

These shameful chemical attacks of yours,

you're making me more popular
than yourself.

The only way you'll ever leave this place

is if Daqeeq here throws you
through that window.

I wish.


My generals, the Four Horsemen,
were just executed.

Do you know anything about that?

Do you?


These attacks on my generals

will only increase the frequency
of my chemical strikes.

It may take years,
but they will carve you up

for all the beautiful things
you have done for these people.

Who? The US? They made me.

Russia? They armed me.

Daqeeq, seriously?

Did you buy that shirt by yourself?

You're embarrassing me.

Sorry. I have bad taste.

Daqeeq is under strict order:

If any harm should befall me,
the same exact harm will befall you.

Specifically and immediately.

I'm going back to Turgistan.

To my safe travels.

and you would have the same creepy,
blank expression on your face.

No offense.

no one would ever know or care.

We would have no impact on anything.

What?

Nah, Vegas.

Vegas.
[Seven] Definitely Vegas.

So, you guys know about us?

Well, we do now, dumbass.
[Seven] Nice.

Well, I guess it's not against the rules,

Depends.

Really great.

'Cause...

Come on, no. What? Wait.

Oh, my God. I'm afraid of heights.
I will have a heart attack.

Yeah? Don't cover your face!
[shouts] Ah!

[Murat] Ow!
Why?

I'm knocking him out.
[Murat] Stop.

You're to save...
[Three] Come on!

It's gonna be over soon!

[Murat] Ow!
Hey, hey, hey!

[Three] Go down!
[One] Stop!

Goddamn it!
[Murat] What bullshit is this?

I thought you guys are here to rescue me.

[One] He's the <i>good guy.</i>
Yes!

What's wrong with you, you fucking goon?
[Murat yells]

I was trying to knock him out.
No. He's the point of the mission.

Use your head.
He wasn't going.

No, get out! Go!

[Murat, screaming in panic]
Oh, my God!

Go.
Whatever. I'm leaving.

<i>AdiÃ³s,</i> asshole.

No. No!

No! No, no. Stay away.
[Three] Come here!


[Three] You fucking...
Hey!

[punching continuing]


Oh, now what?

Do you have rabies?
No.

You have rabies?

What?
What?

What the fuck is wrong with you?
He was escaping.

And why do you think
he might wanna get away from you?

You should thank me.
I just saved the mission.

What? Get off of him.

Get off of him.
[Murat] Get off me.

How many times
do I have to save this mission? Fuck.

Probably have some ice in the car.
Fucking sick prick. I'm so sorry.

[Murat] Your buddy is an asshole.
Hey.

Come on. It gets better.

Don't help.

Don't help. Just stay right there,

He cocked it first.

I find people by examining their links

Once I find a thread, I pull it

How is this different?

Whatever links to the world

And yet they walk the Earth

They have blood types and birthdays

If they exist, they can be made not to.

We're good.

This shit isn't sitting right with me,

You said you'd always let me

Yeah. Yeah, I did say that.

Yeah, you remember that?
Okay, easy.

You know why we don't use names?
Why?

No offense, Four, I'm glad you're alive,

We were totally exposed.

If I was up there, I'd expect you

Fuck that.

Fuck the mission.

Yes.
You gave me fucking goosebumps.

Bullet-bullet-bulletproof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bullet-bullet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish that I was bulletproof
Bulletproof â™ª</i>

As they ricochet within a noose â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish that I was â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bullet-bulletproof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bullet-bulletproof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A monster inside of my skin
And I don't know where to begin, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's a monster inside of my skin
And I don't know who's gonna win, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish, I wish that I was bulletproof
Bulletproof â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish that I could wear a mask
And face the truth â™ª</i>
