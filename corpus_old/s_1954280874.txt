<i>( music resumes )</i>

News anchor:
<i>The situation on the ground</i>
<i>is ongoing</i>

<i>while the entire disputed area</i>
<i>remains closed</i>

to news organizations.

As last night's
report of a series
of large explosions

awaits official
confirmation,

<i>widespread fear of</i>
<i>a biological weapons launch</i>

<i>continues to spread</i>
<i>throughout the region.</i>

( speaking Arabic )

Justine, what are you
seeing in the capital?

The Foreign Ministry
remains shuttered for
a second day

as evidence mounts
that the insurgents
may have used

at least some part
of their long-rumored

<i>biological weapons</i>
<i>stockpile</i>

<i>in the course</i>
<i>of last night's incursion.</i>

News anchor:
Have you been able
to get any word yet

on the government's
response?

<i>( guitar music playing )</i>
<i>- Well, it's hard to find</i>

any officials
here at all in
the capital, Mark.

But those who are willing
to speak off the record

confirm the regime's
plan for a massive
retaliation

in the next five
to seven days.

Well, while we are trying
to restore that image,

<i>ITL News</i>
<i>has just obtained</i>

<i>amateur video footage</i>
<i>purporting to show</i>

<i>casualties</i>
<i>from last night's exchange</i>
<i>of missile fire.</i>

<i>A warning--</i>
<i>this footage contains images</i>

<i>that may be disturbing</i>
<i>to some viewers.</i>

<i>Obtained from a junior</i>
<i>military officer</i>

<i>fleeing the site</i>
<i>of last night's clashes,</i>

<i>it seems to belie</i>
<i>assurances from both sides</i>
<i>of the conflict</i>

 <i>that no chemical</i>
<i>or biological weapons...</i>
<i>- Damn it.</i>

<i>...have been deployed.</i>

<i>Such images</i>
<i>are horrifying enough,</i>

<i>but there's an even more</i>
<i>horrific scenario</i>

<i>if the contagion spreads</i>
<i>beyond the region,</i>

<i>potentially</i>
<i>infecting tens...</i>

if not hundreds
of thousands.

They're saying--
Look, I'm...

if you want,
I'm just gonna go
to the guitar shop.

The pickup
fried out, so...

They can't just
keep fighting, right?

Female reporter:
<i>We are now going live</i>
<i>to a press conference</i>

<i>at the Centers</i>
<i>for Disease Control.</i>

Man:
<i>As of 8:00 a.m.</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time,</i>

<i>the CDC has not measured</i>

<i>any airborne contaminants</i>
<i>beyond a 100-mile radius</i>

of last night's advance
in the Middle East.

What this--
what this means

is the continental
United States has not

and will not be affected

<i>by the reported use</i>
<i>of these pathogens.</i>

Female reporter #2:
<i>Steven, the situation</i>
<i>in the larger cities</i>

<i>near the epicenter</i>
<i>of the conflict</i>
<i>remains tense</i>

<i>as persistent rumors</i>
<i>of mass deaths</i>

in scores of towns and villages
<i>gain credibility.</i>

<i>At least three</i>
<i>regional governments</i>

<i>have begun issuing</i>
<i>gas masks...</i>

Male reporter:
<i>Rumors abound in the capital</i>

<i>as the prime minister</i>
<i>and his cabinet depart</i>
<i>the city...</i>

( speaking Arabic )

Translator:
<i>This is simply a precaution</i>

<i>in order for us</i>
<i>to maintain</i>

<i>government function...</i>

Female reporter #3:
<i>Meanwhile, a veritable</i>
<i>exodus of refugees</i>

<i>continues to stream</i>
<i>across regional borders,</i>

<i>desperately seeking safety</i>
<i>from a threat</i>

<i>that remains,</i>
<i>perhaps intentionally,</i>
<i>undefined.</i>

Male reporter #2:
<i>In Washington, the president</i>
<i>has issued a statement</i>

<i>urging calm</i>
<i>and affirming</i>

<i>that no known pathogen</i>
<i>poses any threat...</i>

News anchor:
<i>The trade winds</i>
<i>are spreading the pathogen</i>

well beyond
the conflict's borders,

confirming
officials' worst fears
about the airborne virus.

<i>Reports of mass casualties</i>
<i>as far north as Italy</i>
<i>and Portugal</i>

<i>are pending confirmation.</i>

Female reporter #4:
<i>What we're apparently</i>
<i>seeing here is a virus,</i>

<i>or a complex of viruses,</i>
<i>killing some almost</i>
<i>immediately,</i>

<i>while leaving others</i>
<i>fully mobile.</i>

<i>However, within hours,</i>

<i>nobody in the affected area</i>
<i>remains alive.</i>

Stay tuned, please,
for further developments

on this breaking
news story.

<i>( guitar music playing )</i>
<i>- Man:</i> <i>That pickup's all right.</i>

<i>But when I move around--</i>
<i>( strumming )</i>

<i>--it doesn't have that punch</i>
<i>and it's just fading out a lot.</i>

Clerk: <i>Don't worry...</i>
<i>- Man:</i> <i>All right, so...</i>

( strumming guitar )
Okay, cool. Thanks, man.

<i>( faint rumbling,</i>
<i>screaming )</i>

He says
it's gonna be,
like, an hour.

There's something...

I am so hungry.
Oh.

Woman:
<i>I don't even know why</i>
<i>we're fighting this thing.</i>

Man: <i>It was</i>
<i>the fucking dishes.</i>
<i>- Woman: Yes!</i>

You guys have maids,
you know?

So it's not like
you see a dirty dish
and you're like,

"Hey, here's a dirty dish.
I've got to do something
about it.

<i>I'm gonna wash</i>
<i>this dirty dish."</i>

You're-- ( laughs )
 <i>What are you-- I mean--</i>

You're totally
fixated on this.
It's not the dish.

 <i>I'm not even talking</i>
<i>about the dish anymore.</i>
<i>- It's a metaphor.</i>

Yeah, it's a metaphor--
I know what you're gonna say.

No, you don't.
 <i>The dish is a metaphor</i>

for my anxiety about
how different we are.

( laughing )
What?

You did know.
Well, of course
I knew.

So, fuck it.
Just wash the dish.

Just metaphor the metaphor.
Just address my anxieties
with dishwashing liquid.

( chuckles )

We'd miss this
if we ever lost it.

<i>We'd be like, "I wish</i>
<i>we could go back</i>

to when the worst thing
we had to worry about

was the dishes."

Woman #2:
<i>Hey.</i>

Hey.

Oh, my God. You guys,
congratulations!

Let me see.
Oh, my God.

That is
so adorable.

So what's going on
with this shit
in the news?

( sighs )

Honestly,
I'm not watching it.
Don't know, right?

Nothing's changed.
Woman: <i>I am going to</i>
<i>go to the bathroom.</i>

Oh.

Ahem.

<i>( woman #2 giggling )</i>

<i>( car horns honking )</i>

News anchor:
<i>Although state and county</i>
<i>authorities</i>

<i>have been almost unanimous</i>
<i>in urging residents</i>
<i>to remain calm,</i>

<i>a spreading, seemingly</i>
<i>spontaneous exodus along</i>
<i>the Eastern Seaboard</i>

<i>has caused state highway</i>
<i>patrol officials</i>

<i>to shut down six</i>
<i>major northbound arteries,</i>
<i>piecing together--</i>

<i>( water running )</i>

<i>( distant siren</i>
<i>wailing )</i>

<i>( car horns honking )</i>

Traffic's insane
out there.

Did you guys
eat my food?

I got you this.

<i>( faint sirens</i>
<i>wailing )</i>

<i>( dishes clattering )</i>

Anna, why have you
been so freaked out
lately?

So, what, I'm not
allowed to talk to any girl
I've ever slept with?

<i>Are you gonna go crazy?</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

( dish clatters )

No, it's
the exact opposite.

I think you should talk
to all the people
you want to--

any girl
you've ever met,

whenever they call,
whenever they stop by,

whenever you
bump into them.

Yeah, I think
you should take

as many opportunities
as possible to talk
to them.

( mutters )
Jesus, Anna.

Because, God,
there is so much time,
isn't there?

There is so much time
between all the dishes
lying around,

the fucked-up amps,
the fried-out pickups,

your rich grandparents...

and your boring,
stupid ex-girlfriends

coming to the "Gates
of fucking India"?

You know?

Because
between all that,

there's so much
time for...

laying
in the bathtub...

and reading
the soap bottle...

( sniffles )

and looking out together,
up at the leaves...

and holding each other,

because we're both
so happy

that we're actually
scared.

( sniffles )

Because if it
really is all over--

Erik, if it was
just us,

and there really was
nothing left on Earth--

<i>( Erik strumming softly )</i>

What are you doing?

No, Anna, Anna,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

That's the song.

That--
that is the song.

Those are the lyrics
to our song.

That's it.

It's gonna be
beautiful.

( crying )

Male newscaster:
<i>No one is willing</i>
<i>to confirm or deny</i>

<i>what we're seeing here.</i>

<i>It clearly isn't benign.</i>

<i>Even at this distance, David,</i>
<i>I've got to admit, I'm scared.</i>

Male reporter:
<i>We're getting unconfirmed</i>
<i>reports of rioting</i>

<i>at dozens of airports</i>
<i>as all domestic</i>

<i>and international flights</i>
<i>remain grounded.</i>

Male newscaster #2:
<i>Hundreds of thousands</i>
<i>of people are now running</i>

<i>through the streets here</i>
<i>seeking any kind of shelter.</i>

Female reporter:
<i>The president and his cabinet</i>
<i>have been evacuated</i>

<i>to an undisclosed</i>
<i>location</i>

<i>while assuring</i>
<i>local authorities...</i>

Female newscaster:
<i>...as yet another</i>
<i>American city reports</i>

<i>an almost unbelievable</i>
<i>casualty rate...</i>

I, the Lord, have held
My peace a long time...

Male reporter #2:
<i>Just in the last several</i>
<i>minutes, it's really--</i>

<i>oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

Female reporter #2:
<i>We are no longer</i>
<i>receiving reports</i>

<i>from the following cities</i>
<i>and municipalities--</i>

<i>Boston and the Boston</i>
<i>metropolitan area,</i>

<i>Bridgeport and the...</i>
<i>- Male reporter #3:</i>
<i>Philadelphia...</i>

Male newscaster #3:
<i>Baltimore...</i>
<i>- "Then the fifth angel</i>

poured out his bowel
on the throne of the beast,

and His kingdom became
full of darkness

and they gnawed
their tongues because
of the pain..."

Woman: <i>Jesus Christ!</i>
<i>- Man:</i> <i>Oh, my God.</i>

Man #2: <i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- "They shall become</i>
<i>refuse on the ground."</i>

( buzzing )

( tone beeping )

( static hissing )

Announcer:
<i>The following is a bulletin</i>

<i>from the Emergency</i>
<i>Management Agency.</i>

<i>If concentrations</i>
<i>in your area have exceeded</i>
<i>80 parts per billion,</i>

<i>you must</i>
<i>take immediate shelter</i>
<i>and remain where you are</i>

<i>for a minimum</i>
<i>of eight days.</i>

<i>State authorities</i>
<i>will continue to broadcast</i>
<i>hourly updates</i>

<i>as long as emergency networks</i>
<i>remain operational.</i>

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

What does that even mean,
"parts per billion"?

<i>Per billion what?</i>

Per billion
of whatever else
was out there, I guess.

It's a beautiful day.

Not a cloud
in the sky.

( sighs )

We could read
something.

Sure.

( sniffs, exhales )

Remember this?

Oh, that.

That was a moment
of weakness.

Well, at least we're not
going to get divorced now.

It's so
clear out, baby.

The birds up there,
they're just flying
around.

It's too bad
we aren't birds.

I wonder what
they're feeling.

Like their favorite
TV show got canceled.

( laughs )

I could talk to you
for another 20 years.

( scoffs )
Aw, shut up.

I mean it.
I was just thinking it
the other day.

( sniffles )
I just realized that--

that you're my wife.

It took me practically
till just now

to really believe it.

( gas hissing )

<i>( faint rattling )</i>

We're going to have
to go to Children's.

What?
( groans )

There are no more
canisters here.

( breathing heavily )

We're going to have to go
to Children's Hospital.

Okay.

( breath hissing )

Woman: Oh, my God.
Man: Don't look.

Woman: Oh, God.
That looks like...

that sweet nurse
in Cardiology.

Man:
<i>Sarah. Her name was Sarah.</i>

Sarah.

( sniffles )

( praying in Hebrew )

( yelling, wailing )

<i>( monitor beeping )</i>

Sarah?
Sarah. Sarah.

Mr. Sachs, I--
Wait a minute.

Look, I know
you're busy, but I
need a favor from you.

It's for my wife.
She's in there waiting
to see Dr. Henderson.

They took her
off life support.

They took her out of ICU.
We're just waiting, Sarah.

Well, we have
an emergency--

Well, this is
an emergency!
You understand?!

This is an
emergency, Sarah!
She's dying!

And the doctor's
just taken a three-hour
coffee break.

Mr. Sachs--
I'm sorry.

I know you're
a good person.

Esther and I really
think of you

as someone close to us,
like you're really family.

Please,
I'm begging you.
Just come with me.

Help me. Help me
get her to ICU.
Come on.

I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to do that.

We have an emergency--
Mr. Sachs?

( groans )
Mr. Sachs!

Jacob! Get me
an oxygen unit.

Jacob, get me
an oxygen unit, now.

Yes, right.

( gasping )

Sarah:
<i>Mr. Sachs? Lift your</i>
<i>head up for me.</i>

( wheezing, coughing )

Try to breathe normally.

Okay?
Yeah.

I've gotta go.
Wait, wait.

Listen to me.

It's a biological
attack.

<i>Isn't it?</i>
<i>- They don't know.</i>

People can't breathe--

old people...

kids...

<i>animals are okay.</i>

We only have
about three hours--

( inhales deeply )

It has to do with
how much material
is in the air.

And winds and...

if it gets up to more
than 35 parts per billion,

you're going to need
one of these to survive, Sarah.

Now listen to me. Listen.
You got to get one.

Not a charcoal filter.
Pure oxygen.

You'll be able to last
eight days. Okay?

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Good luck.

( inhales deeply )
Woman: <i>Nurse!</i>

I have to go!

<i>( oxygen hissing )</i>

"Connect me
to something.

Give me something,"
I said. You know?

"Give me something,
Counsel.

Give me something
that connects my client
eating baba ghanoush

at some
streetside cafe

somewhere in...

do we even know where
this was taken, Tracy?"

And then Tracy said...

And then I said,
"No, the prosecution
just gave us Exhibit 345,

defendants Hightower,
Esselen, and Sachs

and 'unidentified man.'
1979."

"So, please.
Help me out here,"

I said, looking
sort of baffled.

<i>"Give me whatever</i>
<i>it is you're hanging</i>
<i>your case on</i>

so that I can
defend my client.

But don't keep giving me

exhibit after exhibit,

so-called 'fact'
after so-called 'fact'

that doesn't add up
to A-- trade secrets,

B-- any of your employees
actually compromising

your trade secrets,
or C--

any material damages
done to your company's
overseas interests,

because if opposing
counsel doesn't
or can't,

or for whatever reason,
they won't...

Your Honor,
I respectfully request

that you
dismiss the case
against my client."

And the judge
dismissed it.

<i>( footsteps approaching,</i>
<i>knock on door )</i>

Woman:
<i>You guys? We're...</i>

we're evacuating
the building.

Reporter:
<i>...the news,</i>
<i>then a proliferation</i>

<i>of rumors and hearsay,</i>
<i>and then almost street</i>
<i>by street...</i>

Man on recording:
<i>Hey, man. Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

<i>( beeps )</i>

Hey, man. I'm leaving
a message, dude.

Did you--
if you're watching TV,

<i>there's a...</i>
<i>- ( people screaming )</i>

anyway, turn on the TV.

It has something to do
with the war.

We're supposed to...

( sighs )

Reporter:
<i>...conflicting reports</i>
<i>of trade winds...</i>

So, um...

meet me
back at the house.

And...

please change
your outgoing message,
though, baby.

Seriously.

Reporter:
<i>...but efforts</i>
<i>to keep citizens calm</i>

<i>and encourage them</i>
<i>to maintain their normal...</i>

( phone buzzing )
Man: <i>I'm gonna take you</i>
<i>left, then right--</i>

 <i>Ah!</i>
<i>- Man #2:</i> <i>Busted!</i>

( buzzing )
...surprise myself!

Ah!
Take it back
right here.

And then I'm gonna
score again.

( both laughing )

Perfect defense.

Oh, yeah!
That's game, baby!

No, no, no.
That's game.

No.
( panting )

Okay, so here's
the deal.

If I sink this,
right here,

you let me
pay you back.

You don't owe me
anything, man.

You see,
that's exactly
the kind of talk

that won't be allowed
if I make this shot.

What happens
if you miss?

Uh...

You know, this is
really gonna determine
my inner morality.

<i>If I miss,</i>
<i>then you never have</i>
<i>to hear about it again.</i>

How's that?
Okay?

Borrowed your Jeep,
fucked up the transmission,
we're square.

But if I make it,
you accept the cash.

( sighs )

All right,
I'll trust your
subconscious.

You hear that,
Rick's subconscious?

You don't really
want him to make
this shot, do ya?

( chuckles )
Make him miss.

You're just--
you're gonna stand
right there?

You never
said anything about
where I could stand.

Okay. Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry.

It doesn't really matter.
That doesn't bother me.

'Cause you know why?
Why?

'Cause I got it
like that.

( laughing )

Man #2:
I give up.

<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

Nice work
on the Sachs case.

Thanks.

Where are you going?

Home.

That's it?

That's it.

( sighs )
Whatever.

( sighs )

Let's not end this
on a bad note.

You're
a wonderful guy,

and who knows what
would have happened

if we had met before.

But it was never
a question.

There was
in my mind.

I'm sorry.

( sighs )

It's the end
of the world.

If it really is
the end of the world,
how funny, you know?

For once,
it really would be
when it feels that way.

How romantic.
 <i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

<i>( car engines start )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( car remote chirps )</i>

Woman on phone:
<i>Anyway, turn on the TV.</i>

<i>It has something to do</i>
<i>with the war.</i>

<i>Meet me</i>
<i>back at the house</i>

<i>and please change</i>
<i>your outgoing message,</i>
<i>though, baby.</i>

Come on, come on.
Let's go.
<i>Seriously.</i>

I'm starting
to tighten up
a little bit.

Let's go.

<i>What?</i>

She told me
to turn on the TV.

<i>She wants me</i>
<i>to meet her at home. </i> - Now?

Yeah.

So you're--?
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

You know what, man?
You are so fuckin' whipped.

Hey, I canceled
a lot of shit for this

so we can
just hang out.

Yeah?
Like what?

Coffee at Saga?

<i>Tarot card</i>
<i>reading?</i>

Yeah.
I'll see you
on Thursday.

You gotta be kiddin' me.
I'll see you Thursday, man.

Yeah, fuck you,
motherfucker.

Thursday.
<i>If you're lucky.</i>

<i>( distant siren wailing )</i>

God damn it.

Erik:
<i>Hey.</i>

I finished the song.

I have an idea.

Why don't we
take a nap,

just forget
about everything?

 <i>( distant siren wails )</i>
<i>- Listen to this.</i>

"The souls
of all my dears

have flown
to the stars.

Thank God
there's no one left
for me to lose."

Hm.

You know what
your grandmother
said to me?

Mm.

She said...

that "the only
important language

spoken in the world

is spoken between

a man and a woman.

In bed."

( chuckles )

I don't know.
Maybe you want
to watch the news?

Nuh-uh.
Or write
some more poetry?

No.

You know what?
We should probably
get up and do the dishes.

No, I don't think so.

( giggling )

<i>( faint ringing )</i>

( Anna moans )

( ringing stops )

<i>( couple</i>
<i>grunting softly )</i>

And so, finally--

eight years later
or whatever--

at some
New Year's Eve party,

Grandpa finally
got up the courage
and he kissed her.

At least,
that's how my mom
used to tell it.

<i>( engine stops )</i>

They're gonna love you.
Seriously.

Don't worry about it.

I'm not
worried, baby.

<i>( door closes )</i>

<i>( distant bird</i>
<i>cooing )</i>

( knocking on door )

Hello!
Anna: Hi!

Hello!
Hi!

I'm so glad
to meet you.

I'm so happy
to meet you, too.

Yes! Goodness!
Ooh!

( Anna chuckles )
Someone did very well.
This is a beautiful ring.

Erik: That's right.
Anna: He did very great.

How are you,
sweetheart?

Men are so
much like kids,
it's silly.

I mean, there's
the guitar

and there's
the garden

and there's basketball
and football--

it's a wonder
they have any time
at all

<i>to devote themselves</i>

<i>to other responsibilities</i>
<i>for family.</i>

But they do.
They do.

Yeah.
Bless 'em.

You know.

I'm gonna have to
sit down, I think.

I just got a little pooped.
Yeah, sure.

What you've gotta watch,
of course, is when you
breed something

more and more
specialized,

it can only survive
under very narrow

and specific conditions.

( groans )
Erik: <i>Here.</i>

Thank you.

Got something for you.
No, Grandpa, I'm fine.

No, no, no.
I'm fine.

No, no, you can't
refuse me.

You just can't.
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer,

so you might as well
just stop.
Okay.

And I wanna tell you
something--

man to man, okay?

No matter how much
a woman may tell you

that she's happy
to support you,

that she's not interested
in material things,

she wants you
to be free--

sooner or later,
they all want the
good things in life.

I know, I know.
But Anna isn't like that.
Well, I'm sure she's not.

I'm not telling you
that she's shallow.

Probably is the most
natural, basic instinct
in a woman--

actually,
any human being--
make a home,

make a nest.

You know, I'm playing
a show at this thing.

It's called
"South by Southwest."

And you know
there's a lot of...

record company people,
and managers go.

That's wonderful.

I can make a living
playing music.
I'm sure you can.

And I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

Don't let anybody
pressure you, huh?

Just take
your time.

If there's anything
ever I can do
to help you,

you know I'm here.

So funny--
I was just thinking
this morning

that, God,
I have turned into
such a typical "girl."

( chuckles )
I never thought
it would happen to me,

but I--
oh, God--

I am completely
obsessed with him.

Beyond obsessed
with him.

I mean, even when
I'm angry or jealous

or, I don't know--
maybe that's the same thing--

but he leaves for an hour
and I can't stand it.

I don't know
what to do with myself.

I feel
kind of crazy and--

( sighs )
that can't be healthy.

Well, I'm not sure
it's healthy,

but it is
the way it is.

Yeah.
Anna: Yeah?

And I'll tell you
something else.

You'd be someplace--
at a party

or a friend's house
or something--

and he'll be over there
talking to somebody.

And you see his face.

And you think,

"He and I
are going to make
some beautiful babies."

Cheers.
Cheers.

( cups clink )

You know what?
I don't think
I can take this.

No, no. I told you
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

No, Grandpa, I can't.
Oh, Erik, come on.
I got it, you need it.

What's the difference?
I always appreciate--

I am not
taking it back.
That's final.

( rips )

I'm sorry.
<i>Idiot.</i>

You're too good
for my dirty money?

You think there wouldn't
be such a thing as war
if it wasn't for me?

I got news for you, kid.
There are worse sinners
on this earth

than your grandfather.
No, no, no. I don't--

Wait till you have
a child!

Wait till you have
a sick child!

Then you'll lecture me.

Attorney:
<i>And if you have any trouble</i>
<i>at all remembering</i>

<i>or if you aren't sure</i>
<i>of your answer,</i>

<i>just say,</i>
<i>"I don't remember,"</i>

<i>or, "I don't have</i>
<i>any specific recollection."</i>

Now, that last one
actually covers
quite a lot.

If, for instance,
you "sort of" think you
might remember something,

but it's possible
that you aren't
remembering it clearly,

it's never perjury
to say, "I don't have
any specific recollection."

They were developing
a pathogen.

I know, Mr. Sachs.

But the prosecution
won't be asking
about that tonight.

It wasn't even
my division.

I offered advice
to my clients

on pharmaceutical
lines.

Okay.

We have
about 15 minutes

<i>until opening</i>
<i>statements.</i>

They just offered me
so much money.

So much.
Millions.

Okay. Mr. Sachs,
look at me.

This trial is not

about how
certain governments

got a hold of
certain weapons

or formulas
for weapons

<i>over 30</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

<i>This trial deals with</i>
<i>the very narrow issue</i>

<i>of whether or not</i>
<i>you violated your contract</i>

<i>with Sichel Systems</i>
<i>by revealing trade secrets,</i>

and you didn't
do that.

You didn't
break the terms
of your contract.

You're innocent.

Have you had
a child?

No.
You can't
watch them die.

She lived
another 15 years

and she gave us
our grandson, Erik.

But the prosecution
doesn't need to know
that, do they?

I took it.

I took the money.

I knew
it was wrong,
but I took it.

My wife is living
in denial,

but I know
it's my fault.

I deserve
to be punished.

We really need
to leave, Mr. Sachs.

Esther:
Oh, my God.

Oh-- it's too far.

Sachs:
We'll get there,
we'll get there.

Hold on.
If we can find some more
canisters up there,

it's gonna get us
eight days of air,

and the poison
will be gone.

( Esther sighs )

To think
I was so scared

about having
that operation.

And Dr. Henderson
died--

Esther, if you're
going to go through

all the ironies
of the situation,

we're going to be talking
another 20 years.
You know that?

I won't say a word.
I don't ever want
to say anything.

What?
What did you say?

Excuse me?

You don't want
to say anything?

Huh?
You don't wanna
say anything...

about my pants?

Something
about my pants?

They're too high.
( chuckles )

Okay, here we go.

Sarah:
<i>Have you been</i>
<i>looking for a job?</i>

Man:
Yeah, I've been
looking for a job.

I print out another
175,000 resumes,

I change my profile
on another million
job sites.

I mean, the thing is--
<i>I even call Human Resources.</i>

I swear to God,
I feel like "Willy Loman."
I said...

( sighs )

"If anything comes up,
do me a favor.

Keep my number.
Give me a call."

I mean, you were
getting plenty of work

when you were putting her
through law school.

Yeah. People
used to hire writers.

You can get
any job you want.

Yeah.
One more job.

Pay some bills.

Buy some stuff,
get another job,

pay some more bills,
buy some more stuff--

Yeah, but it's that
or what?

Play basketball
with your buddies all day

and let Mia
buy your shirts?

You know what's
interesting to me,
is that why--

instead of printing
a bunch of resumes,

why we all don't
just stop

in the middle of
the street and say...

"What the hell
is going on here?

What is this
all about?"

I mean, why am I
here on this earth,
you know?

Oh, Len--
No, I mean it.
I mean it.

Why does the universe
expand for eternity?

Wh-why--
( stammers )

how much longer
am I gonna live?

Why am I the only
animal that knows
it's gonna die?

We all asked ourselves
those questions

when we were, like,
eight.

Yeah, but why
did we <i>stop</i> asking,
you know?

'Cause I never
got any answers.

<i>( distant phone</i>
<i>ringing )</i>

Is this
about the war?

( sighs )

This is about what
I'm supposed to be doing
with my life.

I just don't know
what I'm supposed
to tell Dad.

Oh, God, Sarah.
Tell him I'm happy.

I mean, you tell me--
X-ray vision--

am I horribly
depressed?

Len:
You know what I just
realized the other day?

We're at some party
at Mia's office

and we'd
just gotten in
some stupid fight

and we're outside
in the parking lot.

And I just
realized that...

she's my wife.

And I love her.

I mean,
I really love her.

She married me...

so I can't really be
that depressed, can I?

God.

I hope I meet someone
like you someday.

Except with a job.
<i>Except with a job.</i>

( chuckles )

<i>( engine knocking )</i>

<i>( engine stops )</i>

Come on.

( key rattling )

<i>( engine sputters )</i>

<i>( rattling )</i>
<i>- Come</i> <i>on!</i>

<i>( distant siren whines )</i>

( mutters )
Fuck.

Shit.

<i>( car horns honking )</i>

<i>( honking continues )</i>

( ringing )

( tires screeching,
sharp thump )

<i>( faint ringing )</i>

Mia?
Sarah, what the fuck
is going on?

Listen--
they're not telling
the whole story on the news.

Well, I haven't seen the news.
What's going on?

Just ignore
what everybody's saying.

You have to get back
to the house.

Get out your dehumidifiers
and ionizers--

anything you have
that filters air--

and seal yourself
into the basement.

( panting )
What-- what is it?
Is this the war?

Just listen.
Remember how we put

Mom's oxygen tanks
up in the attic?

Yeah.
I got rid of those
months ago, Sarah.

( sighs )
Damn.

Well, just stay down there
as long as you can.

Len:
<i>I'm starting</i>
<i>to freak out here, Sarah.</i>

What's going on?
How do you know all this?

Because I-- I met
someone who knows
about this,

and I--
<i>Hey, Sarah?</i>

<i>Sarah, listen to me,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

What the fuck?
Hold on a second.

I gotta give you
a call back, okay?
I'm gonna call you back.

Len: <i>Stay safe.</i>
<i>- ( handset clatters )</i>

Recording:
<i>Attention, please.</i>

<i>There has been</i>
<i>an emergency reported</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

( Sarah moans )
<i>Leave the building</i>
<i>immediately</i>

<i>using marked stairways</i>
<i>and exits.</i>

<i>Do not use elevators.</i>

Hey, buddy.

Do you know
where your mommy
and daddy are?

You okay?

Recording:
<i>...using marked stairways</i>
<i>and exits.</i>

<i>Do not use elevators.</i>

( sighs )

( groans )
<i>Attention, please.</i>
<i>Attention, please.</i>

<i>There has been</i>
<i>an emergency reported</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

<i>Leave the building</i>
<i>immediately</i>

<i>using marked stairways...</i>

It hurts.
( sobs )

What hurts?

My tummy.

Where does it hurt?
Hmm?

It--
( gulps )

Okay, okay, buddy.
Okay.

 <i>( distant siren wails )</i>
<i>- Uh...</i>

we're gonna...

Man:
What the fuck
are you doing?

Len: Hey--
Get the fuck away
from my boy!

Hey, man, it's okay.
Your kid is not doing--

hey, whoa!

Hey, hey--
hey, listen!

Jesus Christ!
Hey, listen, man!

Len: Listen!
Fuck you--

Daddy!
Damn it! Listen!

( grunting )

Listen!

Jesus Christ, man!
Stop!

Listen to me.

Take care
of your son!

<i>( distant police sirens</i>
<i>wailing )</i>

<i>( distant sirens</i>
<i>whining )</i>

<i>- ( music playing )</i>
<i>- ( laughter )</i>

Hey, do you have
any Goldfish?

Girl: Um...
Anna: Yes, Goldfish.

Maybe up there.

Thanks.

Uh...?
( laughing )

Anna:
<i>Wow.</i>

Do you think
that they

stuffed everything up
like that for the party?

No, I think that is
just how they keep
their things.

Erik: <i>You know what's</i>
<i>weird about that?</i>
<i>- Anna:</i> <i>What?</i>

Oh, shh-- Oreos.
<i>( Anna gasps )</i>

Look at this.
Anna: Mmm.

Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

( laughing )

Yummy, yummy.
( laughing )

What's...

what's weird?
Huh?

What's weird about it?
What's weird, what's weird.

You said--
It was...

I don't know.
It's just weird--

ever since
we got engaged,

there's suddenly
like all these--

I don't know,
these waves that we--

No.
I know exactly
what you mean.

There's, like,
a right way

and a wrong way of
doing everything,
and we're, like--

You know why?
It's 'cause we're, like,

we are like,
the Anna and Erik tribe.

You know?

And I mean
there's something
terribly wrong

about putting the--
look, the cat food
next to the tea.

Yeah, but for
the Jprobably the way
Henry we stack things

and put things
together really neatly

seems completely insane
and constricting.

Right?
Yeah, yeah.

I mean it already
feels so wrong

to do it any other way
than the way <i>we</i> do it.

Right, but <i>that</i>
<i>is how it begins,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

<i>That</i> is why countries
invade each other--

'cause of that.

( giggling )

"You don't put
the tea in the
right place."

Yeah? Fuck you!
Fuck you, you're
the bad guys.

You have no idea
how to do it,
and we're better.

"You know what?
The green tea
goes on the top shelf

next to the cocoa,
fuckwad, or I'm
gonna kill you."

( laughing )
The beginning
of civilization.

I'm sorry.
I have <i>got</i> to
move this.

No, I mean,
it <i>so</i> doesn't
belong there.

There is something
immoral about it.

We'd be hypocrites
if we fail that.

Future generations
will thank us.

The products of
this apartment will
cry out for liberation.

It will be a beacon
of proper shelf
arrangement

<i>- for the entire region.</i>
<i>- ( clattering )</i>

( giggling )

Oh, my God.
So good.

Anna:
I can't find
the Goldfish.

( giggling )

He was up there.
God.

<i>( music fades )</i>

<i>( faint screaming )</i>

( car horns
honking )

<i>( wind rustling )</i>

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

I hear you.

( faint echo )

<i>( wind rustling,</i>
<i>birds chirping )</i>

<i>( chirping continues )</i>

<i>( wings fluttering )</i>

( rustling, crunching )

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

Hi.

Hi.

Was I talking
to myself?
No.

I've been feeling
so weird these
past few days.

You know...

I see stuff.

<i>Out of the corner</i>
<i>of my eye sometimes.</i>

I don't even
tell my boyfriend--

my fiancÃ©.

And these
past few days, I...

<i>I mean literally,</i>

<i>last night,</i>
<i>for a second,</i>

<i>it was like there was</i>
<i>nobody left anywhere...</i>

...except animals.

Running down the middle
of the street.

( sniffles )

God, and Erik was like,

"What?

<i>What are you</i>
<i>staring at?"</i>

You didn't say?

They say
schizophrenia starts

when you're, like,

19 to 25.

Rick:
<i>You hear voices?</i>

Well, I just heard
a bunch of crows

screaming
"War! War!"

( chuckles )
Well, they aren't
telling you

to jump off any
high buildings, right?

No.

Good.

My name
is Rick.

I'm Anna.

I've considered

the high
building option.

But life is so
absurdly short,
anyway.

Yeah, I've been
thinking that.

Makes you only want to do
the important things.

But what are
the important things?

I'm pregnant.

First time
I've told anybody.

Woman: Greyhound.
Erik: You got it.

Vodka
and grapefruit.

Erik:
Here you go.

Thank you.

You don't know
what a Greyhound is?

Hey, who got us
this job?

So, anyway,
all I'm saying

is marriage
is just

all of these
artificial
restrictions.

It's like going on
some radical diet

when you're
not even fat.

All I'm saying is,
yes,

agreed,
congratulations

Anna is hot.
She's incredibly hot.

And, granted, you're
probably not going to
meet anybody

who's that hot
and whatever cool

and interesting
and wonderful.

Mia:
I don't know
what you're talking about.

You're making
a scene.

Well, what is he
looking at, then?

Right now he's
looking at you.

Having dragged me across
the room and yelling at me

in front of
all my coworkers--
I'm not yelling at you.

Can I get a
vodka and tonic?

Brilliant, that's
exactly right.

Yeah.
Fucking more alcohol

because that's really
going to help.

Thank you.

See? He probably
thought he was marrying

the most magical,
beautiful girl
on earth.

It's up to you, man.
I'm just saying

you could be dealing
with that kind of shit

for the rest
of your life.

Or I could spend the rest
of my life saying,

"I met the one
true love of my life

when I was 22 years old
and I was too scared

to ask her to marry me."
If she is the one true
love of your life.

I mean, there are
billions of people.

( voices overlapping )

No, she's--

she's the one
true love of my life.

( chuckles softly )
Okay.

So you have the rest
of your life

<i>to ask her</i>
<i>to marry you.</i>

( mutters )
Fuck.

( exhales sharply )

It happens
every time.

I get dressed up
to come to a thing
like this,

and it's
a fucking disaster.

( sniffles )

<i>( faint buoy bells</i>
<i>ringing )</i>

Len,

none of these people
matter to me.

None of these people
mean anything to me

except you.

( sighs )
Let's get out
of here.

( both panting )

Len:
Ah, fuck.

( sighs sharply )

Oh, God
I need water.

Water.

( mutters )
Done.

What's this?

<i>I got it</i>
<i>at the museum.</i>

( bottle lid clanking )

It's a trilobite.

It's probably like
300 million years old.

And now they
just give them away
with a $50 membership.

( laughs )

There used to be
billions of 'em.

They must have had
a lot of sex.

They couldn't
help themselves.

( laughs )

They were in love.

Or it was
just instinct.

( laughs )

Same thing,
I guess.

I'd have babies
with you.

I mean, not right
away, but...

we should,
you know?

( sighs deeply )

( scoffs )

What?

I never said never.

I said, "Don't
marry me if you want
to have children."

( laughs )
But you would?

I could.

Yeah, I would.

We should.

Mia: Right?
Len: Right.

Think of how beautiful
it would be.

"It"?
She. She.

Okay. We will.

You promise?

Not right away.

But someday.

Promise.

<i>( key chain rattling )</i>

<i>( police siren wailing )</i>

<i>( key rattling )</i>

Mia?!

<i>( rapid thumping )</i>

Mia:
There you go.

( both sigh )

<i>( door bangs )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( sirens continue )</i>

Len:
<i>It's okay.</i>

<i>( car door closes,</i>
<i>faint tires screeching )</i>

Come here.

So we need to--

I need you
to get everything
out of the kitchen

that you can, okay?
I need you to just get
everything that you can.

Okay?
I'm going to go upstairs
and get some blankets.

Okay?

Gonna bring it down
to the basement.

Okay? Yeah?

Sure.

Okay.

Ooh.

Andy, it's...

to stop.

I thought
you didn't want
to talk anymore.

Esther:
I just don't
want to sit here

watching you
kill yourself.

Sachs:
We'll get there.

You see?
If we can just
make it up there,

we're gonna find
some more canisters,
I know it.

Stop that, Esther.
Stop it, come on.

Take your hand--
( grunts )

( Esther moans )
Sachs: --Take your
hand off the wheel.

( Esther grunts )

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry,
but look.

I've gotta--

we can't afford
the energy it takes

to fight like this.
( moans )

I wish-- I wish
you would put

more energy into
finding solutions.

There are no

The news broadcasts
have stopped,

and...

everybody
that we love is dead.

Listen to me.

Everyone I love
is <i>not</i> dead.

The only person
on earth that I love

is still alive.

Oh, you're such

You could
charm the knickers
off of any girl.

Well, there's no
girls left

but my girl.

Okay.

Here we go.
( grunts )

<i>( plane engines</i>
<i>whining )</i>

Anna:
I can't stand how much
I miss you when I'm gone.

Erik:
I know.

Anna:
Oh-- so, I got
a new book

that I really
want to read to you.

Erik:
Okay.

Anna:
<i>Wait, I don't know</i>
<i>which one to read to you.</i>

Anna:
<i>Wow, that song</i>
<i>is really good.</i>

Erik: Yeah, you know, I--
Anna: Let me just
read you one.

What-- you don't
have to stop.

( laughs )
I know, I know.

I mean,
I just, I just--

I just wanted to
show you something.

In the park.
I want your opinion

on something
that they're building
across the river.

Uh, what,
before we go home?

Yeah, yeah.

It's just been
bugging me. I pass it
every day on my run,

<i>you know.</i>

Right.

So do you want
to look at it?

Uh, sure.

You don't want
to hear this?

No, no.
Read it to me,
read it to me.

Ahem.

"At the red towers
of your native Sodom,

the square where
once you sang,

<i>the spinning shed,</i>
<i>at the empty windows</i>

<i>set into the house,</i>

<i>where sons and daughters</i>
<i>blessed your marriage bed.</i>

A single glance,
a sudden dart of pain

stitching her eyes
before she made a sound.

<i>Her body flaked</i>
<i>into transparent salt.</i>

Her swift legs
rooted to the ground."

Right?

That's--
that's incredible.

You're so distracted.
No, I'm not. I liked it.

No, you have no idea
what I just read to you.

Not no idea.
Come on.

Hey.
"Dilute."

( straining )
"Dilute. Dilute!"

Dilute. Okay.

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Let's go see your</i>
<i>weird-ass building.</i>

( Anna laughs )

<i>( ship horn blowing )</i>

Erik:
Okay. Uh...

this looks right.

See that...

that big red building
with the arches?
It's that.

Anna: Oh.
Right next to it
with the...

The water tower,
just right under that,

there's like this cluster
of red buildings.

Anna:
That red garage-
looking thing?

Erik: Yeah.
I can't really see it.

Anna: Is it next to the--
Erik: Yeah.

What am I
looking at?

( shuddering )

Hey!

I have to give this
to you now.

Oh, my God.

What does that mean?
What does that...

is that a "yes"?

You have to say yes
if you're gonna--

( sobs )

You still
need to say "yes."
( Anna laughs )

I love you.

I love you
so much.

( Anna laughing )
Erik: Say yes.
You need to say yes.

Please.

Anna:
Look at you.

â™ª You love me...
( giggles )

( grunts )

Esther:
<i>Well, what do you</i>
<i>think of our news?</i>

What news?
<i>Our</i> news.

Erik and Anna.

Oh, that's fine.
( grunts )

Oh, honey. You don't
dislike Anna, do you?

I think she's wonderful
and I just love her.

I'm just so happy
about this.

I like her fine.
( grunts )

You know I offered him
some money and he wouldn't
take it?

Oh, well, he's
getting married.

You know,
he's going to be
the big macho man now.

Head of the family.
He'll probably never
take money from us again.

Well, I bet if I
made it in real estate

or cattle ranching,
he'd take it.

( Esther chuckles )
What are you laughing at?

Nothing--
well, yes, I am.

I'm thinking of you

standing in the middle
of a herd of cows.

Very funny.

<i>( bangs jar )</i>

Honey, don't do that.
( smashes )

Oh!
Oh, shit.

God damn it.

Did you cut yourself?
No.

Just leave it.
I'll get it later.

Come on over here,
my darling man,

<i>and talk to me.</i>

What's the matter?

Tell me what's
really troubling you.

( sighs )

I took their money.

They wouldn't have
paid me so much

if they weren't
gonna use my knowledge.

Oh, no.
You weren't
working for them.

You were just working
at their laboratory.

They wanted
great scientists to work
at their laboratory.

It gives them
prestige.

I knew they were
working on pathogens.

They were just
picking my brain.

All I could
think about was Liza.

Listen.

That money...

gave Liza 15 more
years of life.

It gave her Erik.

What if they
use it, Esther?

What if they use it

and everybody dies?

Well, I think
you're going
completely crazy.

I really do,
you know.

You are not to blame
for everything
in this world,

no matter
how smart you are.

And I'll tell you
something else.

I'm taking a little
offense at this.

I didn't marry
a murderer.

I married
the kindest,

gentlest,

most loving man

in the world.

I don't think
you ever knew

just how much
I love you.

I swear, it--

Esther?
Ow--!

What is it, honey?
Ow!

Come on, Esther.
Come on. Come.
Oh. No.

Come on, come with me.
I'm fine. I just got excited.

Come on, come on.
Let me take you.

I'll take you upstairs.
Okay, come on.

One, two, three.
( Esther grunts )

Here we go.
Oh...!

( panting )
Come on.

Come on.

I'm okay,
really.

Len:
<i>Well, whatever it is,</i>
<i>seven or eight days.</i>

When we're done
with the water--

and there's
tangerine juice, too.

When we're done
with everything,

then we go up.

<i>Even though the radio</i>
<i>said eight days.</i>

<i>Maybe we ought to</i>
<i>make it seven.</i>

<i>But what the fuck</i>
<i>do they know, you know?</i>

<i>Air could be clear</i>
<i>at six.</i>

Clear enough, anyway,
for me to go up

and get supplies
and come back down here.

Len: <i>What?</i>
<i>- The last thing</i>
<i>they said was...</i>

"200 million dead
in Europe."

So that's not
everybody.

Nothing's
gonna be left, Len.

<i>We don't know that</i>
<i>until we see.</i>

Len, nothing's left.

The radio stopped.

( sighs )

There's no more planes
or helicopters.

When's the last time
you heard anything
other than birds?

We'll stay down here
three more days.

And then...
( Mia sobs )

we'll drive
to the marina.
No.

( sighs )
We'll get a boat.

We'll go out
on the lake.

( sighs )
And we'll keep going
until we find someone.

I don't--
What?

I don't wanna...

wade through
a bunch of corpses

to go steal a boat

to go look at more corpses
lying on a bunch of docks.

( sobs )

Even--
( sniffles )

even if we did
make it, Len,

what are we
supposed to do?

Do you really want
to play "Adam and Eve"?

Build it all back up
so it all just gets
destroyed again?

Maybe people
will learn.

<i>( Mia sniffling )</i>

It's like that guy
who hit you for trying
to take care of his kid.

It's like that guy
I defended-- great guy,

good father,
always showing me
pictures of his grandson--

who helped invent the shit
that killed everyone.

People aren't
going to learn.

It's something
in us.

It's something
in the way
that we're made.

Then at least...

we'll have more time.

At least we'll go out
on the water together.

We'll find a boat
with a nice, big cabin.

Come on.

( sighs )

Len?

That guy, Jay,
from the law firm?

He fell in love
with me.

I never did
anything.

I never let him
touch me.

( sniffles )
But I...

you know, I--

I made him think,
I guess...

that he had
a shot at it.

Why?
It was just a way to--

Just a way
to pass the time?

--to feel better
about myself, I guess.

Why do you need
to feel better
about yourself?

Mia:
<i>It wasn't about you.</i>

( sobs )

It was
just my curse.

Len.

Why are they
gonna stay down here

like caged animals?

Or we're gonna go
upstairs tomorrow...

and lie down
on the grass.

Breathe in...

and die...

when and where
we choose.

We'll eat
the chocolate bar
before we do it, okay?

Mia:
Okay?

( playing softly )

<i>( Anna giggling )</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- What? What?</i>

Did you buy
this weird soap?

What?

Anna:
I seriously think
I've found my new religion.

( Erik chuckles )
Oh, yeah, that stuff.

Wait, have you
read this?

No. I mean,
the writing's
so tiny--

Wait a minute.
Listen to this.

"Einstein, 1939.

After Nazis
and Commies united,

proposes 'space bombs'

that destroys all

unless we finally
teach the moral ABCs

the real Rabbi Hillel
taught Jesus

to unite all in,
all one, God faith."

( sighs )

( latch clicks )

<i>( oxygen hissing )</i>

<i>( hissing stops )</i>

Did you find
a pay phone?

( coughs )

I got some noodles.

Just gotta add water.

And some drinks.

And there's
these things--

energy bars.

And napkins.

I couldn't find a pay phone.
I don't think they make them
anymore.

What is this doing
on a soap bottle?

And where
did you get this?

I mean, it was at
the health food store.

It was cheap.
"We're all one or none.

There is no god
but God.

Teach 'Love thy enemy.'

One Israel-Moses-
Buddha-Jesus-Mohammed.

One! All one!"
All one!

<i>"Dilute! Dilute! Okay!"</i>
<i>( giggling )</i>

How about
the switchboard?

The hospital
switchboard.

Or all of these
houses and apartments
around here.

They've all
got to have phones.

Esther...

he's gone.

Erik's gone.
<i>( Anna giggling )</i>

Oh, look at this.
Read this.

"For on God's
spaceship, Earth"--

( together )
"With bomb and gun,

we're all one
or none.

All one, all one,
<i>all one!</i>

Exceptions eternally?
Absolutely none!"

"Absolutely none."
( laughs )

Oh, my God.

Why is the most
inspiring thing
that I've ever read

sitting
on a soap bottle?

"Dilute."

( together )
"Dilute! Dilute!"

"Dilute!
Okay."

( laughing )

You don't know that.
It's just the way it is.

Because he could be
with any of his friends.

That's just it,
honey.

You don't know it
for sure. You don't--

( sobbing )

No! No!

Oh, oop!
( Anna giggling )

No...
( sobbing )

( laughing )

Esther:
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

Shh...

( moaning )

<i>( rustling )</i>

<i>( rapid footsteps</i>
<i>pattering )</i>

<i>( siren wails )</i>

Man: Okay, people.
We're closing down
shop in two minutes.

<i>You've got two minutes</i>
<i>to get your purchases</i>
<i>up to the counter.</i>

<i>Okay?</i>

That's it, man.
We gotta go.
Cashier: <i>Come on.</i>

250. Let's go.

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

Um... fuck.

Man:
<i>Hey. We're done, man.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

I-I gave
all my money to--
here, just run this.

Yeah, okay, buddy.
That's it. We're outta here.

You're closing up shop.
Just-- just--

you're not selling
any more of these
anyway, right?

Don't be stupid, man.
We ain't giving them away,
either.

I understand that.
Just take this. Here.

That's all I got.
It's all I got.

Get the fuck
out of here.

Get the fuck
out now.

<i>( sirens wailing )</i>

Hey.
Hey! Put down the kit!

It's the end of the world, okay?
Just let me walk out of here
with a chance.

Put down the kit.
( gun hammer clicks )

What? The last thing
you wanna do on earth
is shoot me?

This is how this shit
started, anyway.

Right?
That's how it started
in the first--

<i>( gunshot pops )</i>

Sachs: You ready?
I'm fine.

Good. If you're fine,
the tests are gonna show it.

Anyway--
( groans )

we haven't
seen Dr. Henderson
for a long time.

Come here.
That's right.

And here I was,
trying to cheer you up.

Oh, yeah.

Sachs:
You remember when
we lived in Washington,

the Georgetown
apartment?

Esther:
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

<i>We both got the flu</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

Yeah. And I
took care of you first.

I ran out
in the freezing cold,

went and got you
a nice, big bowl
of hot soup.

Esther: <i>It was so cold.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Yeah.</i>

And I wrapped you up
all nice and cozy
in a blanket.

Remember?

Then I turned
the thermostat up
as high as it would go.

Esther:
<i>Then it was my turn</i>
<i>to baby you.</i>

<i>( Sachs chuckles )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Tucked you in real tight,</i>

<i>And I made you</i>
<i>some of those awful</i>
<i>poached eggs you like.</i>

Mm-hmm.

It's been
a good life.

Yeah,
I think so.

Sachs:
<i>A good life.</i>

( silent )

Oh, I forgot
to tell you.

What?

The best thing
in the world.

( Anna, Erik
moaning )

( moaning continues )

I have something
to tell you.

( faintly )
What...?

The best thing
in the world.

We're going to have
a baby.

We don't
have to do this.

( sighs )
Whatever we said
last night,

<i>we don't</i>
<i>have to do it.</i>

<i>Not today,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

Mmm, mmm.

I regret
every fucking diet
I ever went on.

( chuckles )

Mmm.

Come on.

Let's get out
of here.

Ahem.

( gasps )

If you have to,

if that's what
you have to do...

go, but I won't.

I--

I don't think we're
gonna run out of food.

I don't think
we're gonna run
out of water.

I think that if we
just stay down here
another couple of days--

No.
if we go up then,
we're gonna be fine.

Mm-mm.
Okay?

No.
Yeah.

Yes!

( sobs )

Yes.

( sobs )

Mia!
Don't leave me!

Don't leave me.
Stay with me.

I love you, baby,
I love you. I need you.

I need you, I need you.
I need you, I need you--
<i>stay!</i>

Please stay!

Please, I need you.
Please?

( sobbing )

<i>( rustling )</i>

<i>( bird chirping )</i>

Girl:
<i>Mama, look</i>
<i>what I found.</i>

<i>( instrumental music</i>
<i>playing )</i>

<i>( guitar music</i>
<i>playing )</i>
