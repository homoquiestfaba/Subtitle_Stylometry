-So, how was your shift?
-lt was a banner night...

TRlSH: Dana, come on, we got to go!

-Let's go.
-Chill, Mom. You'll get heartburn.

So, this guy's robbing a liquor

You know,

Anyway, they take him to the hospital,

-How's calculus?
-You're relentless, Mom, you know that?

TRlSH: Honey, why don't you

l will, l will.

Maybe she shouldn't be in calculus.

Honey, she needs to challenge herself.

Uh-oh!

Where is my prosciutto? lt was right here.

You know,
calculus might just be too advanced.

-Nonsense.
-Maybe for you, Mom, but l'm not you.

-Hey, ''Bye, Dad''?
-Bye, Daddy.

-Bye, hon. Have a good day.
-Next time, be my backup.

Good. Excellent.

Justin, l don't even have your rough draft.

lf Justin doesn't pass this class,

he doesn't get to play basketball.

-Mrs. Kremer, l have 1 81 students...
-lf he doesn't play basketball...

...1 78 of them turned in their papers.
Justin was warned.

Not once, not once did he come to me
and tell me there was a problem.

-You don't do the work, you don't pass.
-He is exhausted.

Well, he is not too exhausted
to play basketball or go skateboarding.

-Basketball is everything to him.
-Yes, but that is my point.

Maybe he needs to change his priorities.

Please, just give him one more chance.

lf he just turns in the paper, he won't fail.

Mrs. Kremer, you need to stop
enabling your son.

Don't you get it? You're not helping him.

Justin will never learn to be responsible
if you keep rushing in to the rescue.

Be in charge. Be the mother.

-Menu?
-Oh, no. Just the usual.

Flop two, over hard! Gorgeous Two!

l saw you last night.

You were outside that apartment building
holding that baby.

-You were there?
-No, l was just driving by.

Yeah. A lot of excitement, huh?

Must be hard doing what you do.

Well, you know,

you get these messed up parents
and the kids pay the price.

You know, they get shuffled from place
to place never knowing where they're going

or who to trust.

And you know, most of the time,

these messed up parents get the kids back,
and then it just starts all over again.

l mean, it just comes with the territory,
you know.

There's good parents out there, too,

but l just don't get called
when people are doing the right thing.

And, yeah, sometimes it bothers me.

Not all the time,
but now and then, you know.

You wouldn't be human
if it didn't get to you sometimes.

You got a point there.

Means you're a good man.

Fry two, let the sun shine!

Excuse me.

(CLEARS THROAT)


-Who am l tutoring today?
-TEACHER: Dana Fahey. Calculus.

-Yo, Cameron.
-All right, l'm out of here. H-E-R-E, man.

-Hey.
-Hey, Justin.

Calculus, huh?

Yeah, l just don't get it.

l mean, l'm up, like, half the night
trying to figure it out, you know, but...

Don't sweat it.
lt's one of the few things l'm good at.

l get so stressed out about school,
sometimes l can't even sleep, you know?

Yeah, you're not alone.

(ENGlNE REVVlNG)

(TlRES SCREECHlNG)

Turn that thing off! l can't think!

-No way! l'm at Level four.
-Mikey!

-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.

You got off work early.

Yeah, apparently, they didn't need me.
No work, no pay.

l'm sorry.

Well, guess what we're having for dinner?

Let me guess... l'm reaching here.
Scrambled eggs.

l bet it's not.

Tagliatelle alla Bolognese
with thyme and Grana cheese.

Told you she whacked her head.

lt's a symbolic first course
of ltalian cuisine,

characterized by egg tagliatelle

and a sauce popularly called
ragu alla Bolognese.

-Wow, Mom, you win the lottery?
-l wish.

No. A cop came in today.
He's nice, really nice.

He tipped me $20.

-Wow!
-And so, tonight, we are celebrating.

You know, you could have
paid the cable bill with that.

You don't need TV,
you need to write a paper.

And to do that, you need energy from food.

Energy, huh? That simple?

Justin, look,
if you need help with the paper,

just ask me, okay? Any time.

lt's too personal.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Oh!

Hello.

Mrs. A.R. Kremer. l didn't...

TRlSH: Yeah. lt's funny.
ALEX: l didn't realize...

You see somebody every day
and you never really get to know them.

No, you don't.

So, how can l help you?

l'm so sorry, Cindy, but it's my job.
l have to deliver this.

You know, it's nothing personal.

Eviction notice?

You're giving me an eviction notice?

And according to the paperwork,

you've ignored three previous notices,
so it's a 24-hour-to-vacate notice.

-Now? We have to leave now?
-Twenty-four hours.

l wish there was something l could do.

Good night.


l really appreciate you taking us in like this.

You sure you don't mind
sleeping in the garage?

No. l prefer bare cement.

Makes me nostalgic
for the good old Shock and Awe days.

l doubt that.

-How long you been out of the military?
-About 1 5 months.

So you like doing this kind of work?

Mostly.
But l have no idea what l really want to do.

Girlfriend? lt's the mother in me.

l just got back from lraq
and Rachel, my girlfriend,

she decided to drive over
to my folks' house after work.

Guy ran a red light and hit her head on.

Wow!

l'm sorry.

l don't know.

lf only l had borrowed my mom's car
and picked her up.

Got to go, Mom. Let's go.

Okay. Just get in the car. l'll be right there.

Well, thank you for taking us in.

(DOOR CLOSlNG)

-What's going to happen to us?
-l don't know.

Hey, you don't have to worry.
lt's going to be okay. l have a feeling.

-Me, too.
-You do? What's your feeling?

lt's our house.

What's going to happen to my friends?
l've lived here all my life.

l miss my dad.

Come here, Mikey.

lt's hard. lt's really hard.

You're a little slow.

Do you know how long it took Michelangelo
to do the Sistine Chapel?

As a matter of fact, l do.

Oh, the family next door,
they lost their house.

So l told them they could
stay here for a while. lf that's okay.

Very okay.

Anyway, l was thinking
that maybe l can give you a hand.


Do you want one of my old T-shirts
to cover your...

No, no, no. No worries.

But l like this.

Watch out Giovanni Hidalgo. Let's paint!

So, where are you from?

Here, there, everywhere.

-Brothers or sisters?
-Big family.

-Do you play basketball?
-No.

The first time l touched a basketball
was yesterday.

What about... What about boys?

-You must have tons of botfriends.
-Not really.

Really?

You must be doing something wrong.

-ls that so?
-Yeah.

Maybe you don't get the subtleties
of human relationships

or the nuance of male psychology.

Hey, well, maybe you can help me.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Romance 1 01 .

lf you want to get a guy,
you got to make him feel like a guy.

You don't shoot three-pointers,
you let the guy shoot three-pointers.

And even if you're smarter
or more talented than the guy,

you let the guy think that
he's smarter and more talented.

Wow, that's amazing.
l would have never figured that out.

-You're a pretty incredible guy.
-Well, l know a thing or two.

So where did you learn
all this delicate psychology stuff?

Marines?

TOBY: You know
what my favorite time of the year is?

Christmas.

When my dad was alive,
we used to put lights all over our house.

-Me, too. We had about a million.
-We had two million.

My dad says Christmas
is all about miracles.

l don't believe in that stuff anymore.

That's so unfair!
You so caught me off guard.

Your garage is so cool. lt's like a big store.

Should we use all colorful ones
orjust bright ones?

Let's use every single one.

-Every single one.
-Yeah.

You sure your mom won't mind
if l borrow these?

l'm not going to ask her.
That way l don't get in trouble.

They're not even plugged in.

BOTH: Wow.

JUSTlN: So, you have to find
the value of K, right?

(CAMERA CLlCKS)

Oh!

God.

l feel like such a loser
coming here every day.

Well, we don't have to come here
from now on.

-Seriously?
-Yeah. No, we can do it anywhere.

l get credit no matter what.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.


What was that about?

-What was what?
-Cameron!

-Oh, nothing, nothing.
-Nothing!

-No, nothing. Just solve for X.
-Okay.

Okay, right back to the problem.

BOY 1 : Come on. Come on.

BOY 2: All right! Coming through!

Hey, we're a team, remember?

We're your best friends.
We're your brothers.

l don't know what the big deal
about this paper is, but figure it out.

Dude, you have no idea.

Then don't come around here anymore.

Can't hit threes from the sideline.

lt just ticks people off.

Whatever, man.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Can l ask you something?

Sure.

lt's about being a soldier.

l mean, what was it like in combat?

Please. l need to know.

(THUNDER RUMBLlNG lN DlSTANCE)

Confusion, fear.

Big time adrenaline and sadness
all mixed up.

More than that you don't need to know.

Can l read you something?

Yeah.

My dad wrote this to me.


''l'm sorry about
what happened between us.

''l had a lot on my mind when l came home.

''Son, l made a lot of mistakes in my life,

''some of which l'm not that proud of.

''But the best thing
that ever happened to me

''was when l married your mom
and l had you and Mikey.

''You're a great son.

''l'm always proud of you,
even when you don't think l am.

''l have that picture of you
when you were 1 0

''and playing in your first game.

''l show all the guys.

''l tell them you're going to be a star.

''Someday l'll tell you
what it's like over here. Not now.''

l want to know.

Okay.

Besides being afraid 24/7,
all soldiers think about

and talk about are their families.

That's it.

Getting a letter or an e-mail from home,

a phone call.

So when a soldier gets wounded,

they're dying, you think they're still
thinking about their family?

When a soldier gets wounded,

the only thing he's thinking about
is his family.

Your dad, when he got hurt,

he was thinking about your mom,
your brother and you.

That's all that mattered to him.

(WlND BLOWlNG)

(ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG ON HEADPHONES)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

TRlSH: Justin! Dinner!

Justin?



Hey, hey, hey.

Hi, what's going on?

Jake said that when a soldier is wounded,

all they think about are their families,
their kids.

Yeah. l imagine that's true.
Sure they think about their loved ones...

No, you don't understand.

Tell me, l want to understand. What is it?

The last time Dad came home,

he had only a few days' leave.

And l had this game
that l wanted him to come to really bad,

but he just wanted to sit at home
in the living room.


l got so mad that he wouldn't watch me

that l said l hated him.

Oh, Justin,

l'm sure he knew better. l'm sure he...

No, Mom! Just listen!

l said it. l totally said it, okay. ''l hate you!''

l mean...

How could l do that? How could l say that?

And that l held a stupid basketball game
against him.

l held it against him
and then he went back and he died.

And l never got to say l was sorry.

Mom, the last words
that Dad ever heard me say

were, ''l hate you.''

ls that what your paper is about?


Yeah.


You need to write every word, every feeling,

-everything that's going on.
-l can't.

You need to write it down.

Mom, l tried so hard, l just...
l can't get it out.

lt hurts too much, l just... l can't get it out.

You just did. You just did.

(TRUCK ENGlNE REVVlNG)

(TRUCK DOOR SHUTS)

-You like?
-You've got to slow down.

The quicker this place is finished,
the quicker we can turn it over.

No, no, no. l told the family next door
they could stay here until l was done.

l'm not done yet.

You will be.

Soon.


So, is Justin going to Formal?

-No.
-Why not?

Tuxedo, corsage, dinner...

No, no, no! You don't need a tuxedo.
Look, it is ballroom dancing, 1 940s.

Tell him to stop thinking
like a 1 6-year-old, okay?

Okay. Okay. Yeah.

-Usual?
-Yeah, thanks.

Hey, about the other night?

-l'm sorry that it was me.
-lt's okay, l understand.

And, you know,
l wanted to thank you for the other day,

you know, when you let me
ramble on and on about...

You know...

You have no idea what it meant to me
that you would, you know, just listen.

Any time.

l'm not coming on to you, okay?

l'm happily married, l love my wife.

But there's just something strange, like,

-l don't know, familiar. You know...
-There is. There is.

-You know what l mean?
-l do, l do, l do. l know what you mean.

Right.

Yeah.

Okay, well, l better get back
to chasing the bad guys.

That's good.

Let's see.


Seriously, why am l even in this class?
l don't even get it.

So why are you?

My mother.

She has this idea in her head
that l'm special.

Maybe you are, just not in math.

You know what l'd like to do?

-What?
-Hold this.

-Ready?
-Yeah.

Ta-da!

Wow, look at that. That's impressive.

l was thinking maybe, when l go to college,
l'd like to major in dance.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

But, l don't know, it's kind of dumb.

No. No, it's not. lt's cool.
Go for it. You know, why not?

MlKEY: Wow! What an engine!

JAKE: Trans temperature gauge add-ons,
propane injector.

MlKEY: Why would you add
propane to diesel?

JAKE: lt's like NOS to gasoline.
lt adds three times more torque.

Wow! You got a turbo-boost chip in here?

Yup, right here.

And this, this little guy
reads your air and your fuel mixture.

And when you plug it in, it takes
your air and your fuel pressure

and it bumps it up 1 30 horses.

Sweet.

-Hey, Jake?
-Yeah?

-l have this idea.
-What kind of an idea?

TRlSH: What are you doing?

JAKE: As you can see, Christmas lights.

TRlSH: (EXCLAlMS) l don't get it.

Go ahead, tell her, Mikey.

So Dad could see us.

Not bad, huh?

No, it's not bad at all.

Wow, look at you.


-Turn around, let me see the back again.
-All right.

Great.

lt really looks great. Fits you like a glove.

-lt's cool, Mom. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Now, if l only knew how to dance.

Come here.


What are you doing?

Come here, put your hand here.
This is how this goes. One hand here.

-Just relax, relax. Loosen up. Loosen up.
-All right.

Find your balance, okay?
And you just sort of go with it.

-Just move. lt's like skateboarding.
-Oh, yeah.

And you come around this way a little bit,
and you look in her eyes and smile,

and then you come around
this way a little bit,

and then the music picks up
and you do something fancy,

-and you go out like that.
-Okay, okay, l got it. l got it.

-All right.
-Yes. l'll go.

lt's fun, you'll have fun. Good.

Kaylin's got to see this.

So, was it my imagination
or did l see you at the park this afternoon?

Yeah. Yeah, l was tutoring a girl
in calculus, Dana Fahey.

-Oh!
-Old Lady Fahey's kid.

l wouldn't call her that.

-lt just might get back to her.
-Whatever. Anyway...

(TRlSH GROANS)

Dana's pretty cool.

She's really cool. And she's smart, too,
just not so much in math, you know?

-More like the artist type.
-ls that so?

Yeah, but you know Old Lady Fahey,
she's just...

Her mother, she's got her
totally stressed out.

And Dana's into pleasing her,
but she's in way over her head.

Hmm.

l mean, you got to be a geek to do
AP in calculus, and trust me, she's no geek.

No, she's not.

-She's not?
-Mom, she's totally amazing.


So, how's your paper coming?

Honestly, l could use some help on it.

-All right, this is what l got here.
-Okay.

Okay, good. Good start.

Okay, right here, third paragraph,

you'd just come back from the game
and your dad's on the couch in the dark...

Just write what happens.
Let the reader feel the emotion.

When did you get so good at this stuff?

MlKEY: Do you believe in God?

Of course.

-l don't understand.
-What?

Where was God when my dad died?

Right beside him.

Well, what do you think?

l am so proud of you.

Really?

To write honestly is a gift.

You think Dad would be proud of me?

Yes, l do.

Yes, well, you're the one who called
for the meeting.

l'm begging you, please.
lf Justin doesn't pass this class,

he doesn't get to play basketball.

-Look, l have 1 81 students...
-lf he doesn't play basketball...

...1 78 of them turned in their papers.
Justin was warned.

Not once did he come to me...

He's got homework. His job, basketball.

Basketball.

-Basketball...
-lt means everything to him.

Please, just give him one more chance.

Don't you get it?

Be in charge. Be the mother.


(ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG)

Mrs. Kremer!

Wait.

Yeah?

l shouldn't have treated you the way l did.

-Look, we're tired, we're all beat up.
-No, no, no.

No, wait, wait, it was wrong of me,
and l am truly sorry.

Yeah, well, l've got a little kid at home alone,
so l'm gonna need to reschedule, all right?

Why don't you let me drive you home?

Please? lt's no trouble and we can talk...

You just passed it.

TRlSH: Oh.

-Huh! Cute house.
-ClNDY: Yeah.

l'm not sure how much longer we'll have it.

What's going on here?

lt looks like they sold the house.

-TRlSH: New neighbor?
-l guess.

Listen, Cindy...

l know Justin has a lot to deal with.
And l have been really tough on him,

but l want to keep pushing him
because l know he can do the work.

Yeah. l know and l really appreciate it.
l really do.

'Cause l haven't been pushing him.
And l wanna help Justin.

Like that paper,
l can totally help him on the paper.

-Good. Great.
-l can.

So thank you for listening.

l haven't been listening.

l mean, really listening,
really hearing people's feelings,

especially my own family.

l think l've been pretty selfish.

Hmm.

Mom, come on.

We don't still need to meet, do we?

No, l don't know, do we?

-l don't think so.
-No.

Thank you, thank you. l'll see you again.

Bye. See you soon. Bye.

-Hi, honey.
-Bye.

Awesome wheels.
lt would be great for off-roading.

Hmm. No.

-Hi.
-Hi, Cindy, l'm Jake.

-Nice to meet you.

MlKEY: Are you moving in next door?

-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

Don't worry, l'm studying.

Dana?

Mom, please, l'm trying my best.

What do you think about
dropping calculus?

-Seriously?
-Seriously.

Why not do something you enjoy?
Something that's fun, like...

Like dancing? Really?

Oh, thank you, Mom.

Hi, honey. What are you doing up?

l am waiting for you.

You know the money we've been saving up
to go to ltaly?

Well, l met a woman today.
Actually, her son is in my class.

ALEX: Let me get that.

And they're good people.
They're really, really good people.

And l don't know, but l just feel like
maybe... Maybe l know them

or maybe l've been where they've been.


l don't know what l'm talking about.

-What?
-Nothing. Go ahead.

l just feel like l want to do something.

Really help.

Help them, at least.

What do you think?

Whatever you want to do, it's okay with me.

l love you.

So, do you want to tell me about your day?

-You want to hear about my day?
-l do. Everything.

Everything? Okay, you got time for that?

For you, all the time in the world.

(GLASSES CLlNKlNG)

-l almost forgot.
-What's that?

Delivery guy brought this. l signed for it.

What is it?

-l don't believe this.
-MlKEY: What is it, Mom?

What?

lt's a year lease. For this house.

Someone donated a year's rent for us.

-Who?
-l don't know.

lt's an anonymous donor. l mean, this is...

Three days ago we were evicted,
and then Jake took us in,

and Justin finished his paper,
scored that winning shot for Dad.

lt's a miracle.

Really.

l got to go.

-Jake, thank you so much. Thank you.
-Thank you.

Come here.

-ClNDY: Thank you.
-Thank you.

-Bye.
-Bye.

-You take care of yourself.
-You, too.

-Bye, Jake.
-Bye.


-JAKE: Hey, Justin.
-What's up?

Semper Fi.

Always faithful.

-Bye!
-Bye.

Okay, all right. Everybody get in the house.
Come on, let's go.

MlKEY: l call the big room.
JUSTlN: No way.

ClNDY: No, first we need
to rearrange the furniture.

MlKEY: How come, Mom?
ClNDY: Jake's cute, but he's no designer.

You know it's not safe for a girl
to hitchhike these days.

You're worried about me. l like that.

l have a feeling
you're not surprised to see me.

You got that right. Anonymous donor?

l had nothing to do with that.
That was somebody else.

You had no hand in that?

You know what l've never had?
Soft ice cream.


-You're joking, right?
-No, l'm not.

l knowjust the place.

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

You like?

Very much.

Mmm.

Mind if l share a small observation?

Go ahead.

So, my truck breaks down
and you have the fuse,

you offer me a job,
but then you do all the work.

And l save a family?

Come on,
we both know it was you the whole time.

Some kind of a plan, right?

lt was you, too, Jake.

Justin needed a soldier,
he needed someone who had been there,

-someone who understood.
-But no coincidence, right?

Good! Yeah.

You know, maybe, sometimes
things just happen for a reason.

Life isn't so much a puzzle as it is a plan.

So, tell me the truth.

You first.

About Rachel, your girlfriend.

You told Cindy that she was the one
driving the night that she died.

But it was you, wasn't it?

Yeah.

Yeah, l lived, she died. That's...

And you've been
driving around this country

trying to run away from it,

and that really hasn't worked
out for you, has it?

Not until you got out of your own head
and you helped someone else.

lt's funny how that works out, isn't it?

How, when you help someone else,
you heal your own wound.

l have an opportunity in a little town
down south that needs a mechanic.

-You interested?
-l don't know.

Okay, l'll go.

Come on.

Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, l'm with you.
l'm with you.

-You ever been on a Ferris wheel?
-What's that?

You know, for someone
who pretty much knows everything,

you sure don't know much.

-lt's pretty ironic, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

l think it makes life more delicious.

Yes, it does.

Jake, l think we're going to
get along just fine.
