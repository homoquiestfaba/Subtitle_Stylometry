I really love these hot days

all the little girls running
around in their sundresses

In the right light you can
almost see through your dress.

Do you know that?

Look all you want.

That's all you're gonna be doing.

I wouldn't say that just yet...

if I were you.

-Vera, hey!
Hey, how are you?

Good and you?

I'm good... look at this

Don't make a sound.

I heard you in there, you little whore.

Shut up or I'll gag you.

Get your skirt up...
Hold this.

I know what you want.

You like that, don't you? Slut.

Yes, I like it.

Who does this pussy belong to?

You.

Wrong answer!

Say "This pussy belongs to Miss Vera".

This pussy belongs to Miss Vera.

That's right.

Who do these tits belong to?

These tits belong to Miss Vera.

Good girl...

Turn around.

Arch it.

And who does this ass belong to?

It belongs to you Miss Vera.

I should make you wash
the stink off my cock

It might be fun to make some
little whore suck it tonight.

You look at me...

This is the beauty that
you create, is it not?

I wasn't always a complete whore.

My boyfriend Luke and I grew
up in Lynden, Washington

a small church town near
the Canadian border.

As Ernest Hemmingway said
about his home town

Lynden was a town of wide
streets and narrow minds.

Luke and I had known each-
other since grade school

and we started formally
dating in high school.

We were destined to be married
and live happily ever after.

Both our fathers were ministers
in different Evangelical Christian churches

but I was going to be a famous artist
and Luke would be a renouned chef.

After high school we travelled
one hundred forty miles to Seattle

to learn our art in the
heart of the big city

and it was there that I met Vera Lake.

Vera has the face of a classic
beauty with her blonde hair

and her pale skin and eyes blue
like that of the August sky.

She came from money but she
ran with the artistic crowd.

And though she feasted on apathy, her
eyes revealed a calculating cynicism.

I thrilled to her attention.

Eat this.
Eat it.

Do you always do what people tell you to?

I believe that I was willing to die for
you answers your question.

Then I'm sure you're going to be
willing to do much more for me.

I won't say no to you.

Come by my appartment tonight
at seven... we'll see.

I would love to, except for

I simply must attend my date at
the Emergency Room tonight.

I hope you understand.

No. That wont be necessary...

The extract of Digitalis essence or
a larger quantity of leaves

would have sent you to the
mortuary tonight.

Lucky you.

It's not gonna be happening.

Well, I'm meeting Luke at 7
so I'll be at your place at 8.

You're meeting Luke?

Darling, Luke is so beneath you.

You and I both know he can't
give you what you need.

If you have to see that little twit to make
a camparison between the two of us

then you just go right ahead.

You know I won't disappoint you.

Come in.

Hello, Ivy.

How was your rendezvous with Lover Boy?

Oh, Luke didn't show up. He had to work late.

It's always work these days,
or his precious alone time.

It's like a secret lover.

I'm getting really jealous.

I would never let a man do that to me.

And you're such a sweet girl...

It's a pity, really.

Yeah, pity.

I feel pretty pitiful.

Dont.

Don't feel pitiful.

Luke just doesn't need you anymore.

And when a man doesn't need you anymore

you find one who does.

<i>You find someone that would die for you.</i>

<i>And love?</i>

<i>Ivy, love doesn't exist.</i>

It's an outdated notion people have been using
for years as an excuse for their actions

Without love what do we have?

Decadence.

You mean like self-indulgence?

Self-indulgence...

beauty. Most of all beauty.

In all it's aspects.

What is beauty to you, Ivy?

Anything that brings pleasure to the mind.

Anything that brings pleasure to one's mind...

<i>Yeah</i>

In that case...
Stand up.

Lower your eyes.

You're not to raise them again until I
give you permission.

Today you're gonna find out what beauty really is.

My beautiful one, will you remove your blouse please?

And your panties, but leave the skirt.

No. Keep your skirt up so I can
see your pussy. Tuck it in.

<i>Like that?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

The most important person you can
give a gift to is yourself.

And I prefer mine...

gift wrapped.

There you look very, very pretty.

Down on your knees.

Did I give you permission to look at me?

I told you not to look until I
gave you permission.

I'm sorry.

You will be sorry.

Maybe you just need a little reminder.

Put your hands behind your back.

Very nice.

Now you're going to lick my pussy...

and you're not gonna stop until I come.

Do you understand?

Yes.

Slower.

Good girl.

Lick me.

Good girl.

Right there.

Lick me right there.

That was good. Good girl.

To show you that I'm not
all selfish bitch...

Drink from the cup of decadence...

and give your life
in the name of beauty.

Are you ready

for the real pleasures of the mind?

Do you know what these are?

These are beautiful too...

Beauty is anything that gives
pleasure to the mind, right?

Drink it.

It's Luke.

Yes?

<i>I was just wondering if Ivy's here.</i>

She sure is.

What's that?

Is that a ring?

Perfect.

See? I've already gift wrapped
her for you.

Vera.

Are you leaving?

The key?

She's all yours now.

There's a riding crop in my closet...

If you were half a man, you'd punish her.

Luke?

Vera?

You're still here...

Of course I'm still here, what do you think?

He didn't unlock you?

What a bastard that boy turned out to be.

You're well rid of him now.

You're the bastard! Unlock me!

You've given yourself to something higher,

No need of Luke.

Vera, we were supposed to be married.

We were soulmates.

I loved him so much.

We've been over this.

Love is an illusion.

An illusion that will fade away.

This...

This is real.

This is who you are now.

What are you gonna do with that?

It's for you to paint.

This is who you are now.

May I suggest a title?

"Crumpled Mess of a Girl"

Vera, you're crazy if you think
I'm gonna paint that.

I wouldn't do that in a thousand years.
Who do you think I am?

My whore now.

When do you want it done by?

Just as soon as possible.

Dressed as a corporate whore today.
What do you think?

Splendid. How did you get in my appartment?

I know where you hide the key, sweetie.

Now it's mine.

I'm not like that. I was experimenting.

Well then. You simply must paint me a picture
of yourself in that uh...

experimental position you were in.

I'd paint it myself if I were as good as you but then
that would defeat the whole purpose wouldn't it?

<i>I pray tell,
what is the purpose?</i>

Your debasement and defilement,
of course.

I told you I'm not like that.

I'm gonna go to Luke and beg for
his forgiveness on my knees.

Oh you'll be on your knees plenty.

Begging for Luke's forgiveness?

I don't think so.

You've left him far behind
in many ways my love.

I'm done talking to you.
You can leave now.

Bend over the couch.

Touch the ground.

The lips on your face say one thing...

The lips on your pussy always
seem to say another.

Which ones are telling the truth?

Yea, now they speak together.

Much better.

Stay like that.

I want you to bend over my knees now.

I want you to rephrase that as "Yes, Miss Vera."

Do you remember what I told you?

Yes Miss Vera.

Do not come unless I give you permission.

That was for your insolence a few minutes ago.

From now on I want you to refer to me as "Miss Vera."

Okay.

Okay what?

<i>Okay Miss Vera.</i>

Is better but...

I want you to rephrase that as "Yes, Miss Vera."

Yes, Miss Vera.

You like when I play with your pussy?

Who's pussy is it?

Miss Vera's pussy.

Good girl.

I told you not to come before I
gave you permission.

Yes Miss Vera.

Then why are you coming right now?!

You disgust me.

Sorry, Miss Vera.

You're nothing but a weak, selfish, little
girl who can only think with her pussy.

I'm sorry Miss Vera.

You should be sorry.

What you need, is discipline.

Not just in sex but in all aspects
of your life.

<i>You'll learn about discipline.</i>

Okay.

What's that, Miss Vera?

<i>This...</i>

It's your collar.

Like a collar for an animal?

Exactly. It's a collar for a pet.

Which is what you are now.

A squirmy little bitch of a dog.

Miss Vera, I can't wear that to school.
I'll be humiliated.

Well, aren't you quick tonight?

Haven't you learned by now that your
discomfort brings me such great pleasure?

Turn around.

This lock is to show everyone
who sees you...

that you're mine now.

Face me.

Yeah. Nice. Very nice.

Now you have discipline,
all you need is direction.

Yes, Miss Vera.

Come.

Such a good puppy.

Heel.

Now you're going to see

exactly who you really are.

Get on your knees.

Look in the mirror.

This is who you are now.

You might not fully have come to
terms with it yet, but you will.

Yes Miss Vera.

I was lucky...

I knew who I was by the
time I was twelve.

Some just take a little longer

but there is a place in this
world for everyone

and your place is as a slave.

As my slave.

Of course, Miss Vera.

We'll call this one... "Girl Meeting Girl".

I'm your muse.

You really should start painting these, you know.

It'll help you to grapple with
who you are on canvass.

Real art.

Yes Miss Vera.

I need some release.

Earlier you so selfishly came before me.

I'm so sorry, Miss Vera.

It's just you excite me so much.

Of course I do

but you need to learn control.

Come.

Heel.

Sit.

I'm gonna put this down...

but do not move until you have
my permission.

Yes Miss Vera.

What I want you to do now is

undress me slowly.

And then, I want you to make love to me.

You have all night for you
to get this right.

So take your time.

Start with my shoes.

No.

I don't understand.

If you're going to make love to me,

you should start at the bottom
by fucking my shoes.

That's a good girl.

Rub them on your breasts.

Alright. You can remove them now.

Oh, thank you, Miss Vera.

Reach behind me now and unhook my bodice.

Yes, Miss Vera.

When I was a little girl

I had a puppy

who used to sit at my feet and lick my toes.

But now you're my puppy.

So I want you to unclasp my garters

for my stockings.

And you're gonna suck on my feet.

Yes Miss Vera.

You're gonna love it.

Oooh. You look good down there.

But you did such a good job with
that I think I wanna have you

lick and kiss me elsewhere.

I'm gonna bend over and I want
you to kiss my ass.

Yes, Miss Vera.

Very nice.

Stand up.

Thank you Miss Vera

You're welcome, my pet.

Now lay across the bed horizontally.

I think we're gonna play a little game...

Okay Miss Vera.

It's called "See",

"Taste, and Guess".

The trick of this game is, you're
not going to be able to see

anything as you guess... Lift your head.

Back down.

Stick your tongue out.

What's that?

It's your mouth.

Stick your tongue back out.

What's that?

Your finger, Miss Vera.

Again.

Now what's that?

Your breast, Miss Vera.

Stick your tongue back out.

What do you taste now?

Your pussy, Miss Vera.

Do you like that?

I'm gonna come in your mouth now...

and you're gonna swallow every bit of it.

You like that, don't you.

Yes, Miss Vera.

Let me taste.

Good girl.

And for that...

I think you deserve to come too.

Thank you, Miss Vera.

What did you learn from last time, though?

Not until you say so, Miss Vera.

That's right.

I want you to play with your breasts.

And do not,

under any circumstances, orgasm
until I give you permission.

Yes, Miss Vera.

You can come.

Now I think I'm gonna have you trained so
that you can't come without my permission.

Oh, Miss Vera, I would like that.

Yes, I'm sure you would...

But...

But if you leave me and I can
never come again?

That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

Yes, I suppose it might be.

Ivy if you're very, very good,
and you do everything I say

I won't want to leave you.

Oh Miss Vera, I'll try

Good girl.

Miss Vera? You said you knew when
you were twelve... How did you?

Well... When we were younger and...

all the neighborhood kids would play "Cops
and Robbers" and "Cowboys and Indians"

I knew early on that I was
more like a boy than a girl.

I use to tie the little girls up to trees.

The little boys too actually.

They loved it... and I...
I loved tormenting them.

The ones that didn't like it...

I think I enjoyed that even more.

Must have been exciting being your friend...

I'm sure it was... and it
still is, isn't it?

Yes, Miss Vera.

My pet.

What am I to do with you?

Miss Vera...
I love you.

You should get some sleep, you have to wake up
early in the morning and make my coffee for me.

Yes, Miss Vera.

It's not bad but, It needs some more sugar.

Yes Miss Vera.

No. No. It's cooled down too much.
Will you go heat it back up?

Yes Ma'am.

There's a drip.

Good girl.

It's excellent.

You really do know how to make
a delicious cup of coffee.

Thank you. I do try.

I got you a present.

Go get me my bag right behind you.

Miss Vera's Bag of Goodies?

Oh yes.

You should have seen the looks I got
at the airport a couple months ago.

Aren't they cute?

They're a little... frilly.

All good submissive little girls need
a pair of pink frilly panties.

It's a law or something.
Put them on.

What a cutie pie you turned out to be.

Alright, turn around. Let me look
at that beautiful bottom.

Walk to the mirror and back for me.

Very nice. Very nice.
You're a keeper for sure.

I am quite fetching, aren't I?

Ha, ha. And so modest.

That ego of yours is gonna get a
spanking over my bended knee.

Promises, promises.

I've created a monster.

In a sexual kind of way.

I've never seen you this excited...

That's my good girl.

Good girl.

<i>The next few weeks of summer sped by
as I discovered the city... and Vera</i>

<i>We were young, beautiful, kinky and in love.</i>

<i>Well. At least I was in love.</i>

<i>The days were filled with sun and exploration
of new people</i>

<i>and the nights... well, the nights were
filled with pain and pleasure</i>

<i>dominance and submission.</i>

<i>and for all my happiness, my pleasures
of the flesh, and even my pleasure of the mind</i>

<i>the darkness of what I was doing
to my beloved Luke</i>

<i>hung over me like the long winter that
chilled Seattle for most of the year.</i>

<i>I'd avoided his phone calls, but I knew
I could not avoid him forever.</i>

Buy me a drink?

You look like you could use some company.

Is bourbon alright?

Bourbon is good.

I'm not good though.

I hurt my boyfriend.

I cheated on him with a girl.

I feel dirty.

You're not a slut.

I'll buy you as many drinks as you want tonight.

I should have sat next you you as
soon as I got to the bar.

You're not like all the other guys.

<i>I could never see you taking advantage of a girl.</i>

All women are good for is a fuck.

They're worthless

meaningless and pathetic
individuals

who have to fill a hollow void
deep within them with sex.

I would do anything you asked.

What?

I would do anything you asked me to.

Oh, Luke

I knew you could do it.

I've needed that for so long.

I need you.

I need you but I need Vera too.

Luke!

Hello?

Hey Vera?

Yes?

<i>I saw Luke. It was horrible.</i>

You saw Luke?

We didn't discuss that.

I know.

I mean I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

I need to see you though. Please?

<i>Fine.</i>

<i>Come over.</i>

Okay. I'll see you soon.

Vera. It was terrible.

He fucked me and he left me on
a cement floor.

Take off your clothes.

What?

Take off your clothes.

Why?

Because I'm not going to have
you coming into my home

with his fucking stink all over you.

Miss Vera...

Time to clean you up.

Get in there!

It's cold!

Shut up! Get down on your knees!

Down on your knees!

Vera!

I don't care that it's cold.

Vera!

Shut up!

Stop squirming!

Miss Vera!

I thought I told you to shut up!

Bend over!

Fuck!

What did you just say?

I don't think I said anything...

Profanity is not allowed in my home.

Did I say something?

Were you brought up with that kind
of language?

No, Miss Vera.

Then what makes you think it's acceptable in my home?

I promise you I won't do it again.

You're right, you won't do that again.

<i>Pretty.</i>

Stay just like that.

This one I think we should call "Potty Mouth".

You're a little charmer, aren't you?

If you say so

We'll see how charming you feel
in a few minutes.

Put your hands behind your back.

Lift your leg.

Something's missing...

Miss Vera?

Miss Vera!

Miss Vera.

Who did it this time, Ivy?

You know who did it, but
it's not like you care.

It's not like I care?

I'm the last person you should say that to.

Look at yourself...

<i>Your neck, your lip, my god...</i>

If I ever get my hands on that
bitch fucking kill her.

You cant kill her, Luke.
I love her.

How can you love someone
that hurts you so badly?

It's because she hurts me,
that I love her.

Then I guesss that's why you never
loved me.

You can't say that.

No... no I can, Ivy.

I have to go home, I'm sorry
I'll see you later.

What are you doing here?

Why wouldn't I be here?

You've already used me once today...

Isn't that all I'm good for?

Is that what you think?

Yeah.

<i>Come here.</i>

<i>COME HERE.</i>

Kneel down.

You're wrong.

I could fuck anybody I wanted.

I choose to be with you.

Why did you leave me on the street there.

I mean, there's people living in their cars...

They could've done anything they wanted to me
if it wasn't for a man coming and picking me up.

Who knows what would've happened? And even
he, he could have been a rapist or a murderer.

<i>Do you think I would put you in that kind of danger?</i>

Hm... I don't know.

That man who picked you up was a friend
of mine. I sent him to go get you.

Really?
Really.

But you needed to be taught a lesson.

I didn't think a spanking was gonna cover it.

I need you to remain faithful to me.
Do you understand that?

Yes, Miss Vera.

I'm going to continue to fuck whoever I like.

You don't have that option.

Well, what if you find someone
more beautiful than me?

What if you don't want me
anymore?

I'll always come home to you.

How come you didn't tell me you
loved me?

When I told you I loved you?

<i>I did that deliberately.</i>

It would have made all the difference.

Ivy, I've been trying to train you

To mold you.

What makes for the best art?

Well... Longing makes for beautiful art.

Very good.

Just when I've given up you
go and surprise me like that.

Do you remember that conversation we
had about beauty and decadence?

<i>Yea, indulgence...</i>

Well, I want more than beauty in my life.

I want art, and I want talent

You're so talented.

I would give my left arm to be able
to paint as well as you can.

But you know, the world is full of talented
people who just don't produce anything.

<i>I'm not gonna let that happen to you.</i>

Those pictures I took of you were taken to
help you find your voice as an artist.

<i>I should start painting soon...</i>

You should start painting tomorrow.

But today we're gonna relax.

You come back to my appartment with me.

I'll let you give me a bath.

Okay

I do love you, Ivy.

I know.

<i>We came to an acceptance.</i>

<i>I was her slave but I was not her doormat.</i>

<i>We were lovers</i>

<i>and I gave her what she wanted</i>

<i>but she gave me what I needed</i>

<i>We were in love and it was good.</i>
