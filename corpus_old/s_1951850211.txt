Where do I start?

Its not you.

Well, actually, it is you.

Look, Im just not-

Im not attracted
to you any more.

I need space.

You kinda-

You kinda gross me out.

In the beginning, it was different.
In the beginning, you were better.

But then I got to know you

I got ya. I got ya. I got ya. I got ya.
Okay. Okay.

Okay, okay, okay. Let me try it.
You gotta be straight.

Okay. - Straight face.
Okay, okay. - All right.

Physical?
Ive been experimenting with other men lately.

A lot of other men
and women.

I dont know. I mean, Antonio can do
this thing with his tongue...

and Williams stamina
is amazing.

And as far as hands go,
well, your fathers hands are-

You are no match.
I have no equal.

Get down here.

If the shoe fits

I want you to wear it
and wear it good

Sulkin about them times
when I was by myself

I was always lookin
for somebody else

But as time went on
I had a talk with my mind

Friends like you and you
I gotta leave behind

And Im sayin´ call me a fool
´CCause you only rub it in

And Ill never see you if I had known
I´lll never see them again

Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

And Ill never, ever
depend on you

Friends and enemies
around me every day

I cant believe
the things they say

Takin me for granted
Give me no credit at all

Ill just keep bouncin´
like a bouncin´ ball

I dont wanna step
on nobody´ss foot but

You call me a fool
but you only rub it in

And Ill never see you
if I had known

Ill never see that again

Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

And Ill never, ever
depend on you

No, no. Those are chocolate chips.

Persistent hillbilly motherfucker.

You think youre never gonna get caught?
We didn´tt get caught.

Its- It´ss only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

What is beetleheaded?
Its a synonym for ´´´sstupid. ´´´

Oh. Well, heres a synonym
for ´´´pprocreation. ´´´ Fuck you!

Its easy for you to point the finger when you´rre
sittin´ on your rich ass in a big fuckin´ house.

Im not rich.
Oh, yeah.

How bigs your TV?
What?

I say, how bigs your TV?
Fifty-inch.

Get in the car.
Oh, please. Lets not make this a social issue.

The point is that even if you wanted to rob
a place, there are smarter ways to do it.

Enlighten me.
A mask. Wear a mask.

You see, the police
have this thing called a ´llineup... ´´´

and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

Find out if theres a security camera
or a hidden alarm.

Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

Then what? Youre set
for two days! Wow!

What do you know, lanky?
I know you go for the big score.

One robbery, youre set.

News flash, big slim.

People with big money,
they protect it.

So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group where I work.

My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

At night, theres only two guards
and a personal security system.

Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

But even if I didnt, I-

What?

I got a booger in my nose?

What?

Diversify.

You cant trust banks, Nick.

The entire system
could crumble at any second.

That bastards so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

Mr ´HHigh and Mighty´´´
is gonna rob his boss?

You hear that,
gila monsters?

Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

You know what, Nick? Your wife really
messed your head up bad, man.

Youre serious?

How much he got?
Only the bulk of his personal assets.

Six, seven hundred thousand.
You what?

Hey, you gonna need some help.
Oh, no, this has nothing to do with you.

Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration...

which entitles me
to partial ownership...

in this
criminalistic endeavour.

Get out.
Maybe Ill just call Quality Design Group when we get back.

I want half.

Were gonna bury
this asshole.

Sure, youre right.

No, sir.

Monitor calls on both sides of the border.
Fax that photo to every precinct on the planet.

Theres so much as a sneeze

Monogamously challenged?

You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

Its the best on the market.
Let me explain something to you, Nick.

If you aint got digital,

This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

Broadcast has three, Nick.

Dont look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

Windows NT?
No. Just Windows.

Man, get out of here with that shit.
Look, heres a nutty idea.

If you actually know something about this
stuff, why not use that knowledge and get a job?

Take a good look at me.

Im not exactly the corporate colour.
That´ss ridiculous.

If you wanted a job, you could have one.
Theres a spider on your head.

Step on the gas, Nick!

I hate new cars.

Uh-huh. Watch your feet. - Uh-huh.

Come on, rubber legs. Lets go.
Watch where you´rre walkin´..

Watch- Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

Perhaps you two havent heard
that my partner and I here...

on this particular stretch of highway.

And we dont take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

You dont understand.
We were-

Oh, shit.
Thats my car.

Can I have your attention, please?
Yeah.

I bet you used to sell more Girl Scout cookies
than any other member of the whole troop, didnt ya?

What were you calling yourself back

Cynthia? Susan? What was it?
I cant remember.

Hey, guys, I will be gentle. Dont even worry about it.
Huh?

Now- Now, dont even worry.

Uh-huh.

I have these.

Oh, now thats not

Whered you put your booty?

Now Ive done it. I finally found
someone I like less than you.

Shit. Thats
a fancy case, friend.

You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this...

a man gets to thinkin
where´ss the wallet?

Thats it.
We´rre dead, man.

Im gonna need
that wallet, Alice.

Wheres that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

Give me your fuckin wallet,
you little bitch.

You know what?
Nick, Nick, what you doin?

Im sure you´rre
a really scary guy.

Im sure that, normally, people just
quiver at the very sound of your voice.

But, you see, I, I cant
see that right now.

I- I-I just see a weak,
desperate little man...

that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

Some puny, little uncoordinated...

cant-make-the-football-team- so-I´lll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

punk, jerk-off bully...

that one day wakes up
and realizes hes nothing.

Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

Time to die.
That just makes you my best friend.

All right,
drop the fuckin gun.

Drop the fuckin gun!

Give me this, motherfucker.

Now back the fuck up before
I kick you in your bitch-ass chin.

Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

Didnt I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

Oh!

Shit.

You shot me.
Im sorry, Nick.

Put down the gun.
Shut up.

You shot me. - I said, Im
sorry, man. I- I-I didn´tt mean it.

The gun just went off.

You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

Well, rarely. Every once

Why you acting so mean?
Hey, look, man. Now aint the fuckin´ time, all right?

You say scary shit, it scares em.

Thats bullshit, man. Don´tt-

Excuse me, sir. Come here.

Come here. Come here.

Mm-hmm.

He was scarier.

Really? You didnt find
what he did contrived?

No. It was scary.
Well, what part?

Well, the, uh, ´FFreeze, motherfucker´´´
part was scary.

And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass...

it, it might be blown off.

You were scary too.
Oh, come on. Youre just saying that. You don´tt have to lie.

No, Im not. I thought
you were very scary.

Really?
Yeah.

Well, thank you, Henry.
Yo, check it out.

Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

Well, hurry back.

I got willpower,

You know what Im sayin´??
Yeah.

There is somethin

On your mind

By the way
you look at me

There is somethin

On your mind, honey

Did you ever do somethin that you
thought would make you feel great?

In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

That must be a fact
of life.

And what youre thinkin´
Hi!

Hi! Nick.

I cant believe it.
What are you doin´ here?

Danielle.
Oops.

I dont know
what I´mm doin´ here.

What are you doin here?
Well, Sheila, my best friend-

Well, she used to be my best friend. I guess,
technically, Marcy would be my best friend.

I mean, they both think theyre my
best friend, which is okay by me.

But once I did have this nightmare
where Sheila and Marcy are sitting...

right next to each other, and this
Eskimo guy comes over and says, ´PPick. ´´´

I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

Anyway, Sheila, shes visiting
and she´ss staying here.

And so I thought Id take her
to a party and show her a good time.

And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

You really look good.

You look-
You look good too.

Thank you.
Do you want a drink?

Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

You know, Im such a klutz. I spilled
beer all over my dress earlier.

And, well, I think its stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

I have Sheilas room key.
You wanna come up?

Lets get hot
Oh, yes, it´ss ladies´ night

And the vibes is right

Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

Oh, what a night

Its ladies´ night

Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

Oh, what a night

Nick, Nick,

All right, Nick. Damn!

Hey, Nick, why couldnt you just use your key?
Turn your bed down?

Stay.

The lady is lookin good

Just like the lady should
Just like the lady should

Ive been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

I just wanted to
make her happy.

This is gonna be a night
that you wont forget.

I try to forget,
but I cant.

Give it to me, Nick.
Give. Thats all I did was give.

Nick? Nick, youre really putting
a damper on the mood here.

Im sorry.
I don´tt know.

Danielle, I cant.
I just can´tt.

I just wanna make you mine

Well be together
till the end of time

Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and I...

had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

And your girlfriend Nick.

But, shit, you two muffins did such an
outstanding job with this financing...

I mean, who could think about killing
at a time like this?

Thanks. Your approval
means a lot.

Did I tell you to speak? Did I tell you to speak?
Charlie, no.

Thats gonna be too loud.

Too loud.

Hello? Hello?
Hi.

Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

Im fine.
Oh, thank God!

I didnt know if, if you-

I thought that-
Youre not hurt?

No.
Oh, thank God! Where are you?

Look, Ann, lets not make this harder
than it has to be. I saw you.

What?
I saw you. I know.

Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

What about him?
Youre denying it. She´ss denying it.

I dont believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

I was there.
Oh. Oh, no.

Yeah. Oh, no.

Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

At work? Well, then your-your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

Nick, it was my sister.
Remember, I told you...

she was coming next Friday
with her fiance?

Well, I made a mistake. It was this
Friday. They called from the airport.

I told them about
the key in the planter.

I called you, but youd
already left the office.

So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

What about
What about the cuff links? Phillips cuff links were on the sink, Ann.

Honey, theyve been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

I left them on the counter so youd
finally remember to bring them to him.

So youre not having
an affair?

No, you dick!
You still love me?

More than anything in the world.

You- You wouldnt believe
what I´vve been through.

Youre gonna laugh,
but I actually- Shit.

Whats the matter? What´ss wrong?
Shit!

Whats the matter? What?
Shit!

Shit! Shit!

Dont touch the sheet, please. Don´tt-
No, no, no.

No, dont move. Don´tt move.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I done moved the hand.

I really dont think you should be moving right now. I

Wait. Let me practise.
Let you practise?

Hey, Nick.

Put down the bag.

Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.
Nick, let me-

Youre an idiot! Shut up! - Shoot this
mother- - No, you´rre a fuckin´ idiot!

Who are you? Crime dog now? Are you aware that

There are killers,

Im a killer, Nick. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
What are you, Nick?

Wait, wait, wait.

Thank God youre here. - Thank God you´rre

Well, some folks in Arizona are

Wait, wait, wait! Officer! Officer!
Officer, two other guys-

´II´mm married. ´´´ Ka-blam!
You´rre too much.

Is the money all there?
Looks like it.

Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

Excuse me?

We have to bring the money back.

No, no.

Maybe youre a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

Oh, T., I didnt tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

Everythings all right.
You see, it wasn´tt her.

She wasnt even there.
Isn´tt that great?

It was her sister
and her sisters fiance.

I dont give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

You aint takin´
this money anywhere, man.

I dont wanna
hear all that.

Let go. Let go.
Gimme the bag. You let go.

Let go of the bag. You let-
Its not your money.

Its not your money.
It´ss not your money!

Its not yours. It´ss half mine.
Let go!

You let go! - Let

Let go!

Get back here!

You okay?
Yeah, Im okay.

And you?
Ill live.

Cant let you take
the money, Nick.

T., my life is in that bag.

Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you cant.

Your face is on the video, man.
They only review the tapes if somethings missing.

I can go into work early
and bring it back. No onell know.

T.

I can get my life back.

You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

Money dont make
my world go ´rround

Im reaching out
for the higher ground

To a warm and peaceful place

I can rest my weary face

Lifes answers we try to find

Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find

Battling inside our minds

Where do I go from here

Will all my friends be there

Cause we´rre living
we´rre living

In a crazy maze

And were fighting
we´rre fighting

To rise above the haze

Lights at the end
of the tunnel

Sometimes the journeys long

There are many theories

Whos right and who´ss wrong

Pressures on
I have to choose

Ive got nothing to lose

I close my eyes
I take a chance

I- I, I now dance
a different dance

Whats the key
to a happy life

Tell me now, now, now

Healthy mind
and lots of spice

Running barefoot
through the trees

Oh, my God!
Thats my idea of free

Ow. Ouch.

What happened to you?

Its a long story.

I got shot.
What?

And I- I think
Im wanted in Arizona.

Plus, my shoes
caught on fire.

You told me you were selling me the top of
the line. The top of the line is digital.

Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

So, Im bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

And if you do not give me
a full refund, you will not...

be doing business
with myself or my company.

Thank you.

So, did you hear?
What?

Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

What? - Well, nothing was
stolen. They- They cut the-

the thingy...

off P.B.s statue.

Um, theyre reviewing
the videotape.

Hi, everybody. Hows it going?
Not now, Nick.

Did anybody see that game last night?
Game? What game?

Oh, that game. Overtime.
Will you please shut up!

Dont touch it. Don´tt touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

Well, thats it.
What´ss done is done. Listen.

Ive got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.

Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Thank you. - This mascot-

This-
Nick! Shut up!

Whats happening?

Well, what is this?
What the hell is this?

I dont know.
You goin´ crazy as a spider!

Somebody mustve recorded
over the tape.

Who had access?
Uh, there was an electrician in here this morning.

What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

I did. The flickers on the-
Fluorescent lights were flickering.

Im really sorry, sir.
This is terrible, Phil.

I would really like to be alone
now. - Ill go now. - You should go.

I would be really like to be alone. - You
should go. - Ill leave now. - You should go too.

I would like to be extremely alone for a minute.
Im gonna leave you alone.

Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

All right now. Cut that out.
Yall wanna eat? You wanna eat?

Yeah, we wanna eat.
I thought you wanna eat. You wanna eat? All right.

Just dont burn the meat.
I don´tt never burn the meat.

Uh-huh. What happened the last time?
Hey, Dad dont burn the meat.

Im gonna put some more po-po sauce

Yeah, thats-
Go see your mama, boy. You know.

Now this is my very
special mustard.

Dont let nobody touch that.
Okay, Mama.

All right.
Yeah.

So, hows the
electrician business?

Hey. Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

I wanna thank you.

I dont know why- I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

Well, dont mention it. How´ss that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

A friend gave me a tip.

A friend, huh?

You hungry?
Yes, we would love for you to join us.

Wouldnt we, Mama?

I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

I told him I know
just the guy.

Well, Im gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

Right now, Im weighing out several
lucrative offers. I mean, they rollin´ in.

A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

Now, thats just
the way I like it.

All I need now is some
of Mamas special mustard.

Stop.

Whatd I do?

Run, run!
Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.

Ill beat you into the-

See you when you get there

Now I seen places and faces of things

must be drinkin´ and smokin´

Pretendin that you´rre locin´
but you´rre broken, let me get you open

Now, little Timmy got his diploma
and little Jimmy got life

And Tamica around the corner
just took her first hit off the pipe

The other homey shot the other homey
and ran off with his money

And when the other homeys heard about it
they thought that it was funny

But whos the dummy ´ccause now
you done lost a hustler

A down-ass brother
done replaced by a bustler

And though I got love for ya
I know I cant trust ya

Cause my crew is rollin´ numbers
and your crew is rollin´ dusters

And just because of that you act
like you dont like a brother no more

I guess thats just
the way you go

I aint tryin´ to preach, I believe
I can reach but your mind ain´tt prepared

I see ya when you get there

Ill see you
when you get there

If you ever get there

See you when you get there

Ill see you
when you get there

If you ever get there

See you when you get there

More temptation and fate
I guess we livin for today

I seen a man get swept off his feet
by a bull with an AK

The situations so twisted
everybody gettin´ lifted

Im just tryin´ to take care
of my kids and handle my business

Cause it´ss way too serious
so you gotta pay close attention

So you dont get caught slippin´
when they come to do all the gettin´

Life is a big game so you gotta
play it with the big boys

Some of us gotta run a little faster
cause we gotta lay the straw

But Id be a fool to surrender
when I know I can be a contender

If everybodys ascended
then everybody can be a winner

No matter your rag color
Deep down we all brothers

And we gonna set a time
Somebody up there still love us

Im gonna scuffle and struggle with ya
I´mm breathless and weak

I done strived my whole life
to make it to the mountain peak

Always keep reachin
Sure to grab onto somethin´

Ill be there when you get there
waitin´ with the sounds bumpin´

Ill see you
when you get there

If you ever get there

See you when you get there

Ill see you
when you get there

If you ever get there

See you when
you get there

As we walk down the road
of our destiny

And the time comes to choose
which shall it be

The wide and crooked
or the straight and narrow

We got one voice to give
and one life to live

Stand up for somethin
or lay down in the game

Listen to the song
that we sing

Its up to you
to make your beef

I guess Ill see you
when you see me

Ill see you

When you get there

If you wanna get there

Ill see you
I´lll see you

When you get there
When you get there

If you wanna get there
If you really

Ill see you
I´lll see you

When you get there
When you get there

If you wanna get there
If you really

Ill see you

When you get there
