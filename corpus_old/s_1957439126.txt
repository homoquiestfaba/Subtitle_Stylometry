[men calling]

[merry music]
[clapping]

[music continues]

Hey, Aishe.
Where's my beautiful bride?

Tell her I want my dance.
Come on, Nikola!

Whoo whoo.
[glass shatters]


[clapping rhythmically]

What are you doing?

Aishe.

Aishe!

[soft tense music]

[heavy breathing]

[soft sinister music]

[door squeaks open]


Hana?

Aishe...

Don't touch me, Tamas.
[squelch]

[Hana cries out] No...

[fast paced music]

Hana.

[muffled groan]


[soft groan]

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

by the hand of your...


[soft gasp]


[soft tense music]

What have you done?

I heard her.

Was Aishe casting
the Abolishment Curse?

Did she say the final words?

[shouts] Did Aishe finish it?
No, I don't know.

Well, she will when her spirit
leaves her body and rises.

[sinister music]

[Hana tearful] Naida,
she's dead.

What are you doing?

We have to sever
the hand that killed her.


The hand that takes the life
holds the life. You know this.

If we bury your hand
with her body

we'll hold her spirit
down forever.

You don't know it'll work.

For the sake of my unborn child
you'd better hope it does.

[Hana cries] Not my hand, Naida.


Please.
[cries]

It's the only way.
[Hana cries] No...

[squelching thud]
[solemn music]

can never be removed, ever.

Or her spirit will rise
and she will finish the curse.


you won't let anybody,

I mean, anybody on our land.

We can't risk anyone
finding the grave.

Promise me, Hana.


[soft thud]

[soft thud]

[sinister music]


May this new generation
light the way for our people!

For loyalty.
For loyalty.

[applause]
[cheering]

[soft tranquil music]

Oh, shoot...

Nikola, will you help?

Thank you.

wear one of these.

The day the man has to wear one,
I might reconsider.

Beautiful.
[Petar] Come.

That's so sweet.

Aw...

[soft chuckle]
I'm so proud.


Drink up.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Really, aunt Hana, we're not
in the old country anymore.

Why is it that only women
have to wear

big old sold signs
once they get married?

Would you try to look for
the beauty in our traditions,

not the fault.

with you more, Mom.

Well, if they're so great,
how come you never wear yours?

[soft grunt]

Dani.
[Dani] Ha, ha...

Hi, I'm Petar's cousin.

Pleased to meet you.
Hey...

If we knew the way
to get invited back

to this old place was
to marry your sorry ass, well...

I'd do that.


Okay, and now
go get some coffee.

Go.

Yeah, that's my brother.
But he's right,

we would have settled
even for a funeral.

Mm. Still charming
as ever, I see.

Your funeral
may be the only time

we do get invited back,

since you probably
won't get married, right?

Ah...



Uh... Spitting...

is a way of ensuring
good luck or success

for our people.

Yeah,
she just wants to make sure

you're going to be a good wife
to my cousin here.

[soft sinister music]

Having second thoughts?

If I knew what I was getting
into I wouldn't have proposed.

What?
Way to wear the pants, girl.


So, she proposed to you?

I like your dress.

[soft chuckle]

You can lose the coin.

The wedding is over.
They're leaving tonight.

Okay, Naida?

Think the rumors are true?

Where there's odor,
there's a pile of...

Jelka! Watch it!

Must be a reason they hid
themselves all these years.

Why come out now, then?

And now the son
marries an American!

This place has some bad energy.

Yeah, it's bad.

Hey.

I know we're still
on everyone's lips,

but that doesn't mean
that they know what's going on.

Naida...

[melodic guitar music]

Music's the one thing
that has always been able

to connect us
to the rest of the world.

[distant melodic singing]

Come on, Nikola.


[sharp yell]

Whoo!

Where is Zara's father?

He left before Zara was born.

aunt Naida never got over it.

No. Her and mom probably
just got into another fight.

Seriously,
I've never seen two sisters

always so at odds.

[soft chuckle]

[cheering]
[applause]

[soft sinister music]

You sure don't want
any visitors do you?

You know what that is?

No, no, I mean...

Those thorns could intimidate...
the toughest of criminals.

[soft chuckle]

It's um...
It's called firethorn.

Something that's protected
my family for centuries.

After a sacrifice is offered,
we're the only ones

who can pass through unharmed.

You know...

if you get tangled in it...
you can't get out.

Those thorns...
lock themselves into place.

They say the pain...
is excruciating.

So, why don't you
dig them up then?

Our people are superstitious
about shovels.

We believe working with them
will eventually lead to death.

Speaking of...

You sure you want this
for your life?

[nervous chuckle] Of course,
I want to.

Yeah, you say that now,
but if you would know...

Just how happy we were

by becoming part
of our family, right?

Yay, family.
[chuckles]

Okay, let's go, sweetheart.
Yeah.

Okay? Family. Woohoo!


[soft chuckle]

[approaching footsteps]

do <i>mama i tata</i> know

that their grandson
was getting married?

There's no occasion in the world

that can take away the pain
and the shame I brought them.

That must be
why Nikola doesn't have

any pictures of his family.

Don't!
Because why be reminded...

every day...
of what you can't go back to.

In a world that's already
ostracized us all,

and now his own family.

Naida.

He's even denied children
of his own,

because he's too frightened
that your curse...


that Nikola sacrificed,

and yet you still allowed
this ridiculous wedding

to take place here.

We all made sacrifices.

Why did you even come?

Because you made me a promise.

That you'd never let any family,
anybody, onto this land.

I know my promise.
And then you broke it...

And now, once again
because of your selfishness

I have to stay here
and protect us all.

My son has never asked
for anything...

but this.

It would break my heart
if he couldn't get

proper blessings
from the family.

[tense music]

We are still paying
for the last time

you let your heart
cloud your mind.


I'm so sorry, mom and dad.


Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.


Purify bad intentions
of all who enter.

How about a drink?


[indistinct chatter]

[solemn music]

[tense music]


[music intensifies]

[crackling continues]

Do you?

Where are you going?
Stay with us.

Yeah? What?

[soft groan]

[breathes heavily]

[indistinct chatter]

My wife needs me.


[glass shatters]

I am family, let me pass.

on its own, Petar.

[Sunny sobs]
[crackling stops]


I'm going to get my mom, okay?
Stay here, okay?

[tense music]

[crackling resumes]

I am family, let me pass.

[crackling fades]

Why would you go in there?

Mom!

I, I didn't. I just...

I just, I got too close
to the edge.

Oh. The herbs will help
with the pain, okay?

Thank you..

[soft sinister music]

[sucks teeth]

Okay?

I'll hold you, okay.

You need to lie down, okay?
I'll take you inside.

Just... careful.

Stop. I'll put some herbs
under her bed, Naida.

and sing something with Dani.

[Petar replies indistinctly]

[door squeaks open]

[distant singing]
[water running]

Water from our land to purify.

Roots from our land to heal.

Shells to strengthen
and protect.

Whoo!


[approaching footsteps]

[soft sinister music]

I came to see
how you're feeling.

I'm, I'm feeling
a little better.

[Petar, muffled]
I gotta go check on my bride.

I'll let you rest up so you
can get going on your honeymoon.

[receding footsteps]

[clock ticks softly]

[solemn music]

To keep in memory.

During your darkest of times,

this memory
can act as your light.

[soft knock]

[door opens]
[softly] Hey.

so clearly.

How is it even possible?
What was I, like four?

You were three.

[soft chuckle]

It is so good to have you back.

How's your thesis going?

It's going.

It's just, um...

It's taken me a while to find
my place in the world, Mom.

You know I home schooled you
to protect you.

Mom, people were saying about...
Mindless gossip.

But you and aunt Naida
perpetuate it

by using your gifts so openly.
[sighs]

We came to this country
so we didn't have to hide.

But we have.

But it's more
than that though, right?

My isolation...
Is Sunny up?



Not yet.
We're going to crash here

and take off in the morning.

[soft sigh]

Thank you...

for an amazing day.

I love you, Mom.

I love you too.

Good night.

[soft tense music]

[door closes]

I pushed too hard to have
the wedding here, didn't I?

No, no, no... I'm glad we did.

Just as long
as you don't hold all the...

spitting and...
loud talking and...

monster plants against me.

[soft chuckle] Stop,
you're great.

I'd kill to have a family.

Well, you do now.

Mm-hm.

[soft solemn music]

How are you feeling?

Still a bit funky.

But...

I'm sure if you do that thing...

Oh.

Well, say no more.

[soft chuckle]

to your Mom's hand?

You really want to talk about
my mom's missing hand right now?

I mean,
it's not like she has a lisp.

in a car accident

when my birth father died.

I'm sorry, I'm such a jerk.

Yeah, you are.


Hana!

Gosh! Jeez, Matej.

I need to go home.

Yeah, no shit. Come on.

It's okay.

[thump]
Ooh!

Are you okay?




[approaching footsteps]

Matej passed out on our couch.

He can't spend the night here.
Can you please take him home?.

I will as soon as I'm done.

The bride's side
was especially empty today, huh?

On both sides were.

Didn't Petar say
her parents died

when she was young
and she has no other family?

Yeah, but to not even
have a single friend show up?

Well, maybe it was all...
too last minute.

What is found downstream
came from upstream.

so what's the problem now?

Well, nothing, just don't
you find any of it strange?

No.

We know nothing about her.

I'm beginning to appreciate why
our people arrange marriages.

Well, ours was arranged.

Even though I don't know you
any better.

[soft sigh]

I have grown...

to truly...

love you.

[soft sigh]


[soft tense music]

[tense music intensifies]


[Hana sighs]

[eerie music]

[soft hissing]
[crackling]

[sinister note]


[chaotic music]

[squelching thud]

[tense music resumes]


my best friend.</i>

my best friend.</i>



[soft moan]

I am family, let me pass.

My blood will cloak
where you lay.

My blood will cloak
where you lay.

My blood will cloak
where you lay.

My blood will cloak
where you lay.

[tense music]

[crackling reduces]

[woman sighs]

[tense music]



[sinister music]

[sinister note]

A resurrection.

[music increases in tempo]

[sinister note]

[tense music]

[soft grunt]

[breathes rapidly]

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

[rapid breathing continues]

[tense note]

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

[soft grunt]

[tense note]

[sinister growl]

[soft moan]

...by the hand of your...


[breathes rapidly]

[whispering male voice] Matej.

[tense music]


What?


[soft sigh]

[soft tense music]

[distant howling]

You'd better not
have taken my car, Dani.

[tense music]

[sinister note]



[squelching thud]

Hmm.

[soft tense music]



[sinister music]

Sunny?

[sinister music accelerates]

Your face, I...

What are you doing out here?

I um...

I, I don't, I don't know.
I just, um...

I woke up outside and um...

Um...

Come on.

Petar, come on.

Come on. Let's get you warm.

[soft tense music]

[soft sinister note]

[sinister music]

[door squeaks]

Oh, damnit, Matej.
I can't believe you drove.

[sinister note]



[soft tense music]

Mom, I need a huge cup of joe.

Good morning, sweetheart.


Oh, you've made <i>kukuruza.</i>
Mm-hm.

Mmm, very nice.

Hot!
Hm.

And <i>sarma.</i>


[softly] Very nice.
Hey!

What?

Mmm.

I can't wait for Sunny
to try this.

I made an extra one for you
to take on the road.

Ah, there it is.

For your health.

We're actually going to
stick around just a day or two.

Sunny's still not feeling 100%.

I'm a little worried
about her leg.

Oh, the <i>sarma.</i>

[soft tense music]

Hey, Mom.

Do you... remember me
sleepwalking as a kid?

Sleepwalking? No.


I woke up outside
last night and...

It was...
[Zara] ...the trash.

What is this troublemaker
doing here?

[soft chuckle] No, seriously,
why are you still here?

Putting off the honeymoon
because you're scared

you won't know what to do?

Sunny's still not feeling good.
Smartass.

You know what,
maybe I should split

before you all scare her off

like you did
my other girlfriends.

It wasn't my fault
you couldn't keep one.

What the hell, it was,
and remember Jennifer Lefton.

I cannot believe
you're still bringing that up.

It started all the rumors
about our family.

Oh, please the rumors
were around way before then.

You mean before
you used your talents

to set those kids' pant legs
on fire

in front of the library? Huh?
[Zara laughs]

fun of you

in front of Jennifer.

I was defending your honor.

Yeah, well,
she never spoke to me again.

So, thank you
very much for that.

Well, at least the boys
left you alone.

And so did everyone else
in this town.

I'm just glad Sunny
didn't meet you

before... the wedding.

No fair.
[mimicking] No fair.

Oh, hey. Sit down.

I'm sorry about your leg.
Is it better?

Yeah, it should be good as new
in the next few days.

Ah... Are you going
to wear that to work?

Yep.

do you do?

Oh.

Let me show you.

Zara, knock it off.

What's the big deal?
She's family.

No secrets allowed.


Zara comes from a long line
of gifted women.

She's known as one
of the intuitives.

Fortune tellers.
Hey.

Don't listen to him.
It's a well-respected gift.

[soft sinister note]

[tense music]

Ma, ma, maybe we should do this
a little bit later.

What?

Uh, why don't you
go check on Sunny?

Go on.

to pick up anything?

Only that she's pregnant?

She's preg... What?

Oh, God.

That'll just complicate
our bindings.

What else did you see?

I don't know.

It was... all jumbled.
I needed more time.

She's still limping.

Mom said that you put
healing <i>trava</i> under her bed.

I did. I did put healing <i>trava</i>
under her bed.

She should have been completely
better by this morning.

Mm.

I cannot get enough of this.

Listen...

You're just overthinking this.

We're not used to having
so many people around.

Maybe.

Thanks again for helping
with the wedding stuff.

I appreciate it.

[clock chimes]

Oh, crap, I gotta go.

What's the rush?

What?

I'm meeting someone for lunch.

A local boy?

When was the last time
one of our own asked me out?

I'll tell you when. Never.

Fine. Tell me about your date.

His name is Dale DeLois Smith.

I don't care about his name.

All right, you know Arnold's?
The hair salon over on Pacific?

Yes.
His mom runs that.

Okay.
Is that enough for you now?

Yes.
Okay.

I love you. Thank you.
[Zara] I love you too.

[soft tense music]

[tense note]


[tense music intensifies]

I want answers, not games.


[music fades]

Yeah?
[door squeaks]

Who were you talking to?


I'm sorry about Zara.

She's... [soft chuckle]

It's fine.

[soft somber music]

We're forever, you and I.

You've stolen my heart.


[soft tense music]

[soft chuckle] Okay.

We really have to go
somewhere else.

Let's go in the house then.

This place is legend.

Oh, no. I mean, we gotta go...

Wait... What did you say?

<i>Witch, old witch
Do you live in a house</i>

<i>Or do you live in a haystack
With the red-eyed crows?</i>

Come on,
who can say they've done it

in the bloody witch house?

Go home.

I don't think so, beautiful.

I said go home.
[sinister music]


Ah!

Ah!

Stop it, you crazy bitch. Argh!

[yelling continues]

[sudden silence]

Go!

Now, before you say anything,
I know that I broke the rules.

I shouldn't have brought
him here.

He was just another asshole
looking for a haunted tour.

Our people are in good practice
of recognizing insincerity.

Usually.

Why don't they
just leave us alone?

Coming to the States
didn't change what we hoped.

Others still project their...

Their repressed reverie onto us.
I know.

Has everyone gone?

No.

Mom, you can't just chase
them out.

Something needs to be done.
I received a warning.

It's because they're here.
I know it.

Listen, you need to do
something for me.

You need to go back to the shop
and wait for me there,

and do not leave until I say so.

No, please, please, please,
just go.

[soft sinister music]


I am family, let me pass.

[tense music]

[music intensifies]

My hand!

The curse...

It's been released.

Naida!

[Hana breathes heavily]

our fate.

that she finished the curse.

We didn't hear the final words.

You're on your own now.

What? No, Naida.
Naida, get back here.

We can figure this out.

[tense music accelerates]

[soft groan]


Can I come in?

Hey, come on in. Come on in.

I was just about to take
a break.

So, how's outside world
treating you, my son?

World's fine. It's just...

Our people's place in it.
It's ambivalent, you know.

Yeah, most of our people
feel the same.

How will anyone
ever take my work seriously

when even my own professors
believe our people

don't even know what a radio is.

The written word
will be our sword.

You'll see.

You... mind
if I take your drink?

Sure.

So, what you're working on
these days?

It's a more a...
personal project.

It's an heirloom of sorts...
for you and Zara.

When we're gone, you know.

The... story of our family.

Oh? I didn't know we were
such an interesting bunch.

[soft chuckle]
You'd be surprised.

We...

We used to be part
of a larger family.


Well, an awful event.

[sinister music]

So wait, you're...

You're saying
the rumors are true then?

That we had something to do
with that missing couple.

Don't listen to the rumors.
They are like odors.

The more pungent they are,
the easier they spread.

That's all. [sniffs]

Every family does have some...
some buried secrets.

Ours is no exception.

Do... some of those secrets
include my birth father

by any chance?

[tense music]

I see.



[approaching footsteps]

[sinister music]

I know you're here.

Why don't you just
show yourself?

[growling]
[music accelerates]

[dramatic music]


[squelching thud]

[music ends]

Petar!

[sinister music]

[footsteps running]


Is everything okay?


What are you doing here?

I'm looking for Matej.
He never came home.

Nikola gave him a lift
last night.

I checked with everyone.

I'm sorry, I don't have time
for this right now.

Then let me talk to Nikola.

He can at least tell me
where he dropped him off.

Hana!

[sinister music]
[thud]

[gate squeaks]

What the hell!

I want to apologize.

[tense music]


"This curse
is extremely powerful

and is forbidden to cast.

Its purpose is solely
to exterminate

an enemy's beloved bloodline."

Exterminating a bloodline.

[soft solemn music]

"In all my research, it appears
the only one who can end it

is the one who began it."

Now...

[tense music]

[soft creaking]

[sinister note]

Petar.

I was um...

I was just looking for Nikola.

Okay.


Unseen come forth.

[sinister music]

[eerie music]

[tense music]

You can't hide a cat in a sack,
its claws will reveal them.

[soft sigh]

that I fell in love with him.

[dramatic music]


[sinister note]


Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

[dramatic music]

[dramatic note]

[sucks teeth]


May the secret of the one
who owns this scarf be revealed.

you've found Aishe's life blood</i>

I've told you this
many times already, child.

But I just don't understand,
<i>tante</i> Galina.

Why can't you call
upon her spirit?


I have been met with only images

of the friends
who betrayed her...

<i>or firethorn...</i>

The blood veil
they have created,

hiding the location
of her body from my sight.

Such a spell would require

the painful
bloodletting sacrifice.

They are unrelenting...

and quite powerful.

But we are all powerful
and gifted people.

Why, why can't I go
after her now?

You can't.

I told you.

They are watching.

They are on guard.

This is only work

if you move like a thief
in the night...

Alison.

Patience.

Yes, your name
is not Leila anymore.

It's Alison Robertson.

Very American.

Pay close attention.

Remember this name.

He will be the one
to give you the words

that will help you pass
through the firethorn,

which hides Aishe's body,

so you can release her spirit

and she can go rest
with her ancestors.

Look for the heaviest covering

and you will find her.

Remember...

Remember.

[sinister fluttering]
[Hana groans]



[deep breaths]

[soft tense music]


Heal me.

Heal me.

Heal me.

Heal me.

Heal me.

[soft moan]

[music fades]


Your eyes!

Aishe's been freed.

It was Sunny.
She's Aishe's sister.

[tense music]

I needed more time.
No!

No, no, we're not
giving up, Nikola.

You know as well as I do,
there's nothing

that can nullify this curse.

we can try.

Now, you said the only way
the curse could be stopped

is if the person who cast it
calls it back, right?

What if I bind my spirit
with Aishe's?

With our spirits intertwined,

maybe I would be able
to call it back.

I will not let you risk

eternal damnation of your soul

based on my hunch!

We have no other options.

Well, that's not one!

Let's at least try
and reach out to the ancestors.

And do what? And do what?
Evoke their help

for a crime we've kept hidden?

One they deem unforgivable.

Don't you see?

We are exactly where we are
because they want us to be here.

[tense music]

Swear to me, you won't try it.

Swear it.

You have to go
and tell Petar everything.

He needs to know
what's happening.

You knew one day
you would have to tell him

the truth about his father.

[tense note]

Petar.
Have you lied to me about him,

this whole time?
[sighs]

There's more to it than that.

[Petar yells]
Start talking! Now!


This is charged, okay?

And it'll help ward off
the evil that's around her.


Take it.

[music accelerates]

[echoed thud]

[sinister music]

[Petar breathes rapidly] Sunny?

[music fades]

[tense music]

[frogs croak]

[eerie music]





[floorboards creak]

[distant howling]

[sinister music]


Prediction of death.

That's it?

[soft sigh]

Okay. I'm definitely losing it.

[eerie music]


[soft hissing]

[gasp]
[thud]

[boards rattle]

[crackling continues]

[quick breaths]

[soft hissing]

[sinister note]


what you want me to do.

Please!

[chaotic music]

[squelching thud]

[soft thud]

[tense music]

Aishe!

If I could take back
what happened,

I swear to you on everything
that's dear to me...

[tense note]

[sinister music]

[Hana groans]

[Hana groans]

Damn you! Just take me!



[approaching footsteps]

[Nikola] Hana!
It's fine.

What, was it Aishe?

Are you absolutely certain?

She said the final words
to the curse?

[tense music]

Without a doubt.

I need...

You should just go.

You're not part
of the bloodline.

The curse won't follow you.
I'm not going anywhere.

I just can't believe
there's nothing we can do.

Wait a minute.

Not us.

Her sister.

Aishe wasn't expecting Sunny

to get wrapped up
in all of this.

Sunny's pregnant.

[sinister music]

Then she's carrying your lineage
inside her.

Yes, Sunny can plead
for the curse to be reversed

because it will affect her
and her child.

Go get Naida and Zara.
We need them.


[eerie music]

[floorboards creek]

[distant thundering]

A storm's coming.

[tense music]

I'm pregnant.

That's...

That's a bit too tight.

Petar...

Petar.


Didn't you hear me?

[sinister music]
God, you're bleeding.

Oh, my God.

Here, come inside.

I'll go take care of this
in the room.

You just, you go wash up.

[sinister music]

[music accelerates]
[Petar] What the hell!

Why isn't this coming off?


[breathes rapidly]

[growls]
[gasps]

[sinister music]

What happened?

You had something to do
with her death, didn't you?

Yes.
[tense music]

It was my greatest mistake.

Nikola's notes.

They mentioned a horrible curse
put on our family.

She's the one
that placed it on us?

the Abolishment Curse.

It's meant to kill off
our branch of the family tree.

into this?

who released it, but now,

now she's the only one
that can help us.


Don't you dare drag her
into any of this shit.

She already is.

[tense music]

I gotta get her out of here.


You okay?


Son...
I'm not your son.

[tense music continues]

Let him go.


When this is all over...

you and I will leave
this place together.

We'll start over again.

Never look back.

Go get Naida and Zara.

I need to go find Sunny, okay?

[sinister music]
[Sunny cries] Oh, God, no.

It's not mine.


It's not my blood.

<i>Tante</i> Galina said nothing
about your curse.

If I would have known
I never would've come here.

I only wanted to set you free.

You have to convince Aishe
to end it,

for your unborn child's sake
before the bloodshed starts.

[soft sinister music]

It's begun.

There was so much blood
on my hands.

Oh, my God, it's you.

That's, that's not possible.

Aishe should have known
that when you place a curse

it comes back to her threefold.

Your sister's spirit is damned.

And now, so are you.

I will not let you damn my son.


[sinister music]

Mom?

[tense music]


[gasping]
[crackling]

I am family, let me pass.

I will put you back
in this pit of hell

where you belong.

[dramatic note]
[groans]


[sinister note]
[gasps]




[tense music]

Zara!

[growl]
No!

Zara!

[growl]
No!

Oh, my God. Zara! Zara!

[breathes rapidly]

Zara!


[sinister note]

[chaotic music]
[metallic scrape]

[Hana yells] No!


[soft creaking]

[gentle guitar music]

[sings softly]

Where have you been?

I, um...

I... I thought
I'd get a head start and...

pack some bags into the car.

[guitar playing resumes]

[sings softly]

You know, I...

I'd never mean
to have hurt you, Petar.

Right?

I'm not following, Sunny.

[cries softly]

[soft creak]
[soft sinister music]

[tense note]

[tense note]


Hana, help me.

[sinister music]
Aishe!

stop this curse, now!

Please!

[whispering voice]

To keep in memory.


During your darkest of times

this memory
can act as your light.

[tense note]

Mom?

Sunny...

What the hell is happening?

Listen to me.
We have very little time.

[soft growl]


[dramatic note]


Hana, I curse your family to die

by the hand of your...

your son!

[tense note]

[tense note]

[tense note]

[tense note]


[tense note]

[soft sinister music]

Mom...

Have I...?
No. No, honey.

I made a vow.

I betrayed my best friend
with her husband...

Your father.

So any blood, honey,
is on my hands.

It's not on yours. Okay?

[Petar gulps]


Stop this!

[soft growl]
[tense music]


[Sunny cries]




[soft choking]

[tense note]

Run! Run!

[chaotic music]

[music accelerates]

[dramatic note]

that the only way</i>

<i>the curse could be called back</i>

<i>is if the person who cast it
calls it back.</i>

<i>What if I bind my spirit
with Aishe's?</i>

you won't try.</i>

[chaotic music continues]

[dramatic note]
[soft grunt]

[breathes rapidly]

Aishe, I bind your spirit.

I bind your spirit.

What are you doing?
Hurry. Get in.

[chaotic music continues]

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

Aishe, I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

I bind your spirit
to mine forever.

[music builds up]

[Sunny cries out]

[Hana] No.
[Sunny] No, Petar, please.

Aishe!

I release Petar from this curse!

[fading tense music]
[thundering]

[tense note]

[muffled thundering]

[soft tense music]

[tense note]
[distorted growl]

[solemn music]
