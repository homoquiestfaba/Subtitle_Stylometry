CARLOS: Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

HARRY: Come on!
Come on, come on.

CARLOS: Fuck! Move, move,
move! Get the door!

Shit!
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

Shut the fucking door!

(TIRES SCREECH)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(TIRES SCREECH)

CARLOS: Florek! Florek!
FLOREK: I'm okay!

I'm okay!
CARLOS: Gotta keep him awake.

JIMMY: Get us out of here,
Harry!

CARLOS: You said
this was handled!

You said this was handled!

Kick that fucking door off!

(SIREN BLARING)
Shit.

CARLOS: Damn it!

Come on, come on, come on!

(SIREN BLARING)

(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
LINDA: I want my money.

CARLOS: (IMITATING LINDA)
"I want my money."

I thought it was our money.

It's my store, Carlos.
My store.

(CHILDREN GIGGLING)
Every time I give you a loan,

it's like an IOU,
but this is a new low.

What, you accusing me
of stealing your money?

LINDA: Why do you
look surprised?

You do it for a living.

Where you get the balls?

What I do for this family.
I risk my life.

LINDA: Yeah. You risk your life

and then
you piss it up a wall.

<i>Mija,</i> come here.

I love you. Huh?

Listen to your mother
even though she crazy. Huh?

She's always crazy.

XAVY: Always crazy.

Come here.

I love you.
XAVY: Always true.

GRACIE: Always true.
(LINDA GRUNTS)

CARLOS: Just let me out!
Let me out!

No way.
We're sticking to the plan.

(HORN HONKING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(LIQUID POURING)

You should eat something.

Does that hurt? That?

FLOREK: Hmm?

Boop.

Boop, boop.

You need to do
something with makeup.

Makes me feel bad
to look at that.

It makes me feel bad, too.
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

Come here. I love you.

Gotta run.
(BABY COOING)

HARRY:
Let's get in the other van.

We'll fix him at home.
Let's go!

(FLOREK GROANING)

CARLOS: Hang in there.
Hang in there.

Come on!
(FLOREK GROANS)

CARLOS: That's it.

(FLOREK CONTINUES GROANING)

JIMMY: What the fuck?


(RAPID GUNFIRE)

TOM: Most people don't know
what an alderman does...

including a fair number
of aldermen.

(CROWD LAUGHS)

It comes from the Old English,
meaning "older man."

When I was a younger man,
Facebook...

Back then,
a face was something

you tried never to forget.

(CROWD LAUGHS)
A book?


A book was something you read
to your son. My son, Jack.

Stand up, Jack. Stand up.

My son.
(APPLAUSE)

The best candidate for
alderman of the 18th ward.

He's your man. Believe me.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(HORNS HONKING)

MAN 1: What, you can't speak?

Yo, could I get
a piece of that?

MAN 2:
Gotta get a loan, player.

MAN 1: I got good credit.
What's up?

MAN 1: Whatever.
(KNOCKS)


Mr. Manning.
JAMAL: Hmm.

My aide, Siobhan.

This is my brother.
Jatemme.

I love you, too.


As a kid, I used to help out
with my dad's campaign.

It looked a lot like this.

Except a little whiter,

I imagine.
Yeah.

Mind?
Please do.

JACK: My father always thought
it was a good idea

to keep the lines
of communication

open with his opponent.

Keep things honest, dignified.

Maybe he could be
more honest and open

about whatever deal he made
with the city council

to call this special election
instead of waiting

until February
like the law says.

He had to step down.

He had a heart attack.

Who does waiting serve?

Everyone who's
not named Mulligan.

JACK: (CHUCKLES) First time
I've run for office.

I'm already ahead of you
by 12 points in the polls.

The Mulligans have run
the 18th ward for 60 years.

My grandfather, my father.

These days it's
all about name recognition.

You wanna go against me?

You don't inherit
a ward, Jack.

You run for it.

You have much experience
in government?

I live here.
So do I.

No, no, no.

You, uh, own a house one block
into the ward.

A house people might actually
want to live in.

It's a smart idea.

Running headquarters
from a church.

I mean, it's illegal.

There's that whole
church and state thing.

More illegal than nepotism?

Nepotism isn't illegal.

It's actually celebrated.
This is Chicago.

Your daddy can put you
on some commission

where people
don't have no say.

Let you be a big boy,
play with a few trains, but...

JACK: Extending the Green Line
is the best thing

for the people
of the 18th ward.

Brings them closer to jobs,
closer to culture.

JAMAL: Those people
don't seem to be the ones

getting rich though, Jack.

JACK: What about you, Jamal?

What have you been doing
to improve the lives

of the people of Chicago?

I bet your reputation's
a real problem

for your communications team.

Maybe you the one who need
the communications team.

I've never been arrested.

Let's see if you can say that
a few months from now.

If you pull out now,
you can save yourself

some money,
ton of embarrassment.

Come on, Jack,
I don't pull out

when it feels this good.

(JACK CHUCKLES)
JAMAL: Right?

All right. Don't forget
to vote on August 8th.

Absolutely. Hey. the election
is on the 7th, Jack.

Oh, I know.

(DOOR OPENS)


(DOOR CLOSES)

Why you wanna go
into politics anyway, man?

Passing bills and shit.
Whatever the fuck they do.

JAMAL: Alderman of this ward
makes a $104,000 a year.

Shit, we make
more than that in a week.

But then you add in
the juice, right?

He gives his friend
a contract

for a new building,
gets a kickback.

Gives his brother a contract
for construction.

Hell, he give his mama
a contract for construction.

That man owns a piece
of every fucking thing.

The only people
coming after him,

they got cameras
and microphones.

People coming after us
with guns.

I'm 37 years old, Jatemme.
I don't want this life no more.

I want his fucking life.

Harry Rawlings is dead.

JAMAL: What that
gotta do with us?

Hey, what?

NOEL: He took
our money with him.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

FULLER: Medical examiner
say he can still ID them?

I think off the teeth maybe?

I always said
he should burn in hell.

But, hey, Chicago'll do.





(BREATHING HEAVILY)


PRIEST: <i>He who admonishes
the young to live well</i>

and the old to make good end
speaks foolishly,

not merely because of
the desirability of life,

but because
the same exercise at once

teaches us to live well
and to die well.

Much worse is he who says

that it were good
not to be born,

but once one is born
to pass with all speed

through the gates of Hades.

(PRIEST RECITING THE
TRINITARIAN FORMULA IN POLISH)

ALICE: (SOBBING) He was
so beautiful, wasn't he?

His eyes. He got away with
so much because of those eyes.

I know, I know. (SHUSHES)

Because they
didn't let me see the body.

I couldn't say goodbye
properly, Ma.

I wanna see it.

I promise you, Alitzia,
you don't wanna see his body.

What's left of it.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(LINDA SPEAKING SPANISH)

(SILVERWARE CLATTERS)

JACK: What do you think
of my new painting?

TOM: What?

JACK: The artist
is really blowing up.

I got in early,
got it for 50,000. Drink?

Yeah.

To the masterpiece. (CHUCKLES)

Yeah, so...

Did you get him to concede?

Go back to his
normal business?

Now, let me
tell you something.

I don't wanna see you
become the first Mulligan...

to lose to a nigger.

Especially this guy.
He's tricky.

Okay?

He's staying in.

But it's fine.
Okay?

Yeah. It's dealt with.

Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Dealt with? What do you mean,
"dealt with"?

Maybe you shouldn't have been
such a hard-ass.

Now, if you'd have
just rolled over

for the mayor
on that housing development...

I don't roll over for anybody!

Okay?

He had his agenda, I had mine.
JACK: Look where that's got us.

The lines of the ward
are redrawn

and we're down 7,000 votes
that would've gone our way.

You created this problem.

Now we might be left
without a pot to piss in.

Oh, says the man
with the $50,000

piece of wallpaper.

It's art.

It's wallpaper.

Art.

Wallpaper.

Whole time caught the niggas

They cold though, Ja.

Hey, man, it wasn't our fault.

They knew where we were
gonna be. That shit was a setup.

They had to be professionals
or some shit.

BIG GUY: You let
Harry Rawlings

get away with our money.

No, that's not what I'm...
(SHUSHES)

I wanna hear what you were
doing. Do it again.

Hmm?

Your music. Hmm?

I'm not kidding. Do it again.

Run.

(BULLET SHELL CLINKS)

Take care of this.

Is everything taken care of?

Yes, ma'am,
I got the roses you wanted.

They got three
different dove gray caskets.

You'd be surprised how much
they want for those things.

You wanna guess how much?

No, no, I don't.
I just wanna go.

Harry said if anything
happened to him,

I should give this to you.

When?

BASH: Uh...

Honestly, I don't remember.

I don't remember
things too good.

PRIEST: <i>Then he will
see you face to face</i>

and in your light will see light

and know the splendor of God.

For you live and reign
forever and ever. Amen.

JACK: Amen.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Harry Rawlings.

He never messed with me,
I never messed with him.

We in different games.
I always had respect.

So why'd he hit me now?

Oh, I know why.

He thinks
you're setting your sights

on something higher,
you're getting sloppy.

JACK: Mrs. Rawlings,
I'm Jack Mulligan.

I had the privilege of working

with your husband
a couple of times.

He was a wonderful man.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

If there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask.

I'm not a hard man to find.

Thank you.
God bless.

(JAMAL SIGHS)

Harry wouldn't have liked it.
The backhoe.

Should've hired gravediggers.

I don't think they have
gravediggers anymore.

I want you
to give me the names

of all the men
that died with Harry.

(RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR)

VERONICA: Who is it?

JAMAL: <i>Mrs. Rawlings,
my name is Jamal Manning.</i>

<i>I'm a friend of Harry's.</i>

Evening, Mrs. Rawlings.
My name is Jamal Manning.

I'm running for alderman
of the 18th ward.

This is not the 18th ward.

Yes, but I'd like
to have a word with you

to discuss some
urgent matters if you...

No.

It's not the 18th ward!
Get out!

Come here, little fella.
(DOG BARKING)

Because I didn't know
your husband.

I didn't know your husband,
not really. Mm-mm.

But he stole
two million dollars from me.

He stole it... (CLICKS FINGERS)
right out of a van

like he knew
where it would be.

I just wanna know why.

(BREATH TREMBLING)

I'm not involved in my
husband's business at all

and I don't know
why you're here.

It'll only take
a moment to discuss.

Oh, yes.

(DOG WHIMPERING)


Mama's got a big house, yeah?

See this one?

Still haven't read that.

Everybody out there involved
in Harry Rawlings' business

as far as the eye can see.

But you, you here living
with him, and you're not.

VERONICA: I didn't work
for Harry.

I work for
the teachers' union.

I understand.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

Criminals like cops, they
don't bring their shit home.

You have no idea, do you?

Or did you choose not to know?

It doesn't matter.

Please join me.

Oh, come on. I don't bite.

Hey...

What do they
say about dogs, huh?

That they're good judges
of character?

You see, that money
was meant to...

buy me a new life,

help with my campaign.
You understand?

Listen, I don't
have your money.

Now, why don't you
just go out and make more?

This is about my life!
(DOG WHIMPERS)

(VERONICA GASPS)
This is about my life.

Because it's about my life,
it now becomes about yours.

I told you.
I don't know anything...

JAMAL: No,
and even if that's true,

you have
a nice penthouse here.

You got
a lot of nice furniture,

you got cars, you got
a closet full of clothes,

none of which burnt up
in the van, by the way.

I'll give you
one month to liquidate.

I'll call the police.

Mrs. Rawlings, do you know
what the police did

the night
that Harry died? Do you?

They laughed. (CHUCKLES)

They laughed
over his melted, burnt body,

and they scraped whatever
they could into a bag

and they went to a bar
to celebrate,

because they give zero fucks

about Harry Rawlings'
fucking widow.

You're nothing now.

Welcome back.

So, uh, my money...

one month.

LINDA: What the hell
are you doing?

How'd you get in here?
Who the hell are you?

Who the hell are you?

I'm calling the cops.

And saying what?

That you're
in my fucking store!

That wouldn't be true.
This is not your store.

Obviously, your loser husband
didn't tell you.

You knew him?

Yes, and he knows
this is not your store.

I have a lease.
I pay that shit every month!

You gave that money to Carlos,

and he spent it all at Arlington

until the money ran out,
and he couldn't keep up.

Then he started
paying it to us.

Then he fell behind,
then he gave us the store.

Or, to be fair, we took it.

It's like this.

Carlos doesn't own it,
you don't own it.

It's a system.

Fuck your system!
That's my money!

Maybe I'm
not explaining this clearly.

Ask Carlos.
He's dead.

Condolences.

I'm just collecting
a debt here, ma'am.

He should've loved you more
and the bookies less.

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

("WILD CHILD"
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

<i>â™ª I want you â™ª</i>

(DOOR CHIMES)

Mrs. Rawlings,
I wanted to say that, uh,

you don't have to keep me
hanging around

the way that Harry did, if you
don't want. You can hire

someone else, if you want.
I can't afford to hire

someone else, Bash.
I can't even afford to keep you.

You don't have to worry.

I can always get a job working
security at a bar part-time.

What if you keep the car?

This car?
Yeah, you drive me around,

you get me back on my feet,
and you keep the car.

Where do you wanna go?

The people I know

are never gonna pay you
for a notebook, Mrs. Rawlings.

So, let's pretend
you just came down here

to refill Harry's flask
and have a drink.

What if I told you that
Harry owed a lot of money...

and now those people
want it from me?

And what if I told you...

a construction accident
didn't put me in this chair?

A debt did.

This is not your world.

Use that notebook
to settle the debt.

They might take it.

It's what Harry
would have wanted.

Render unto Caesar...

what is Caesar's,
Mrs. Rawlings.

AGNIESKA: Oh, my God!
It smells like a dead rat!

I think I should get a job.

AGNIESKA: As what?
A house cleaner?

Serve coffee?

Why would you ever do that?

What else am I gonna do?

I went from your home
to Florek's home.

Men are supposed
to provide for you.

Where did all the money go?

I told you, Ma. We spent it.

Wanted me to have a nice life.

How much did you
get for your things?

Three thousand.

What about the bike?

Gave it to Florek's friend.

What am I gonna do
with a bike?

You idiot!

You never ask for enough!
Why? I should be like you

and ask for everything,
like I deserve it?

Drive my husband
in the ground?

Take care of myself
before my children?


ALICE: I'm sorry, Mama.

I just don't know what to do.



AGNIESKA: Such
a beautiful girl I made.

I wanna show you something.

(BAG UNZIPPING)

It's an arrangement site.

Alitzia,
these girls are smart.

They go out one night a week
and make as much

as they'd make
in a month at a 7-Eleven.

On top of that,
if you're sweet...

like you...

they get bonuses.
They get jewelry.

They get treated
like a princess.

And they go to college.

That's what I want for you,
sweetheart.

Is that so wrong?

I'm not gonna sleep
with men I don't know.

That ain't my life.

What do you mean by that?

Who the fuck do you
think you are, Alitzia?

You forget whose roof
you slept under

when you were 16, 17, 15.

So don't act like you're
the fucking Virgin Mary.

Those boys didn't pay me.

Everybody,
thanks for coming today.

Today, we are
standing on a vacant lot.

But tomorrow,
thanks to MWOW,

the Minority Women Owned Work
initiative my father started,

this will be
a thriving business,

owned and operated
by the women of this ward.

And it is my dream

to continue that amazing work
that my father began,

because this
is the 14th business

that has opened
in the past three years.

As long as there is
a Mulligan in office,

there will be 14 more
in my first term, I promise.

Now, can I get an "M-Wow"?

CROWD: M-Wow!

Can I get an "M-Wow"?

CROWD: M-Wow!
All right, all right.

Now, where are my, uh...

Where are my success stories?
Yes!

We got some success stories.
Come on.

MCROBERTS: Mr. Mulligan,
we want to talk about

the audit that just came out.

Come on up!
All right, let's...

MCROBERTS: Perhaps some
of your constituents

will be interested
to hear about it.

These women, they aren't just
in business for themselves.

They're in business
for the whole community.

Over a million dollars

they have generated
in the past three years.

That's money that goes back
into the community.

It's money that stays here,

in the 18th ward.
MCROBERTS: Mr. Mulligan,

an audit by the Cook County
comptroller

shows over five million
dollars in overages...

JACK: All right. Here we go.

MCROBERTS: ...from the proposed

extension of the Green Line.
JACK: M-Wow!

During that time, you were
head of the CTA's commission.

JACK: Congratulations.
A position

you were appointed to
by your father.

Do you care to comment on the
contracts you awarded while

serving on the commission?
Mr. McRoberts. Sorry.

I'll see you all on the 7th.
Thank you for coming out.

MCROBERTS: Come on, Jack!
Give me a quote I can use.

What about the contracts
you awarded

while serving
on the commission?

SIOBHAN:
All right, that's, uh...

MCROBERTS: What about
the proposed extension

of the Green Line?
That's enough questions,

thank you.
The Green Line

should serve
the people of this ward.

Now, it can bring customers
to business like this

and at the end of the day, it
can take tired workers home.

Without that kind
of infrastructure

MWOW is just another
empty gesture doomed to fail.

You asked me about my father.

My father taught me
about this neighborhood.

He taught me
to empower the very people

that this city has
overlooked for so long.

But I'll see you, 18th,

and I'll make sure
the rest of Chicago does, too.

Thank you.

MCROBERTS: End fucking quote.
(CAR STARTING)

JACK: That fucking
scumbag McRoberts!

Won't he ever just give up?

He's been shit on the sole
of my family's shoes forever.

SIOBHAN: I wouldn't worry
about McRoberts.

I'd be more worried
about the numbers.

Your friend Jamal's no joke.

JACK: Fucking Jamal...

(JACK SIGHS)

(HORN HONKING)

Tell me, have you ever slept
with a black guy?

SIOBHAN: I'm sorry?
JACK: You heard me.

Have you ever slept
with a black guy?

SIOBHAN: What does that have
to do with Jamal, or anything?

JACK: Just answer
the fucking question.

SIOBHAN: We are in a situation
where you could lose everything.

You've got the IG's office

and the Feds
breathing down your neck.

You got Jamal Manning
climbing in the polls,

and all you're concerned with

is whether or not
your dick is bigger than his?

JACK: What are we
fighting for? This?

You know how many
shootings happened

in this city
last weekend alone?

Thirty-four! These people
are killing each other!

This is not where
I wanna raise my children.

What are we
fighting for exactly?

I feel suffocated!

I'm not a Mulligan,
I'm my mother's son!

God rest her soul!

The shit she had to put up
with from my father!

SIOBHAN:
I'm putting up with it, too.

That's what adults do, Jack.

JACK: I never wanted to be
in this fucking business

and that's all this is.
It's a fucking business!

Christ! I just wanna
be free of this shit.

Can't take it anymore,
I just...

SIOBHAN:
Wake the fuck up, Jack.

You are not going
to pussy out now.

What are you gonna do?
Work in a bank?

Take the train downtown,
punch a clock?

This is your life!

This is our life.
It's what we do.

Everyone has
a fucking sob story,

most of them better than yours.

So, if the idea is to be
mayor one day,

you'd better man the fuck up!

JACK: Jesus.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

Anybody who thinks different
are fooling themselves.

It's the God's honest truth.

Thanks, John.

JACK: Fellas!

LINDA: <i>I can't believe
none of us have ever met.</i>

ALICE: <i>Are you sure we

LINDA: <i>She invited us.
It's fine.</i>

So she didn't tell you
anything else on the phone?

Nothing.
Just the time and place.

VERONICA: Is one of you Alice?

ALICE: Mm.
Amanda?

I'm Linda. Who's Amanda?

Let's hope it doesn't matter.

I'm Veronica Rawlings,
Harry's wife.

You're Harry's wife?

How'd you two meet?

Follow me.

VERONICA: Your husbands worked
a long time for my husband.

With your husband.

VERONICA:
How you doing for money?

Here. To tide you over.

Till what?

(DOOR OPENS)

How are the children?

She's the one with the kids.

They're fine.

I have a business proposition.

If you have
a high-risk threshold.

Listen.

We're in trouble.

It was Jamal Manning's money
that our husbands stole.

Who's that?

Somebody you
don't wanna fuck with.

The money burnt up in the van,

and Jamal Manning,
he wants it back.

From us? Or from you?

Harry left me the plans
for his next job.

It's worth five million dollars.

I take two million,

give it to the Mannings.
We split the rest.

You want us to...
Pull off the job, yeah.

A million apiece.

A million?

Maybe you have a secret plan
or a special skill

that can make you
that kind of money.

But if you don't,
there's an address

in the pads of money
that I just gave you.

Meet me there
tomorrow at 11:15.

What if we say no?

She'll give him our names.

11:15 AM?

PM.

It's not easy. I have kids.
I don't want any trouble.

Listen, our lives
are in danger.

Our husbands
aren't coming back.

We're on our own.

Now, I'll be there tomorrow.

I hope to see you there.


So, what has
happened in the world...

that normal now
passes as excellence?

When did we lower
our standards?

There seems to be
no expectation

to go above and beyond
what one might know.

MAN: Yeah. Yes, sir.
Or might want to know.

It seems people are blissful
in their own ignorance.

(CONGREGATION AGREEING)

How far have we fallen?

Indeed, how far have we fallen?

We are living in an environment
where people are blind!

What you don't see,
you don't know.

Out of sight, out of mind.

So now ignorance
is the new normal.

(CONGREGATION CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

In fact, ignorance...
Ignorance is the new excellence.

The less you know
the more seemingly you gain.

(CONGREGATION AGREEING)

Not to care is deemed
to be smart.

When you subtract
love from any equation,

from any situation,
from any location,

the result is always hurt
and pain on all sides.

(CONGREGATION CHEERING)

That is why
we need to bring love

back into the equation.

Love.

In Jesus' words,

"Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."

So he can hear you on high,
say it with me.

"Thou shalt love thy neighbor

as thyself."
JAMAL: Amen!

Even when it ain't easy!

Even when
you've been done wrong!

When this world's got you down
on your knees...

love thy neighbor as thyself.

All right. Amen.

Noel, how are you, my brother?

Reverend Wheeler.

I'd like to introduce you
to Jamal Manning.

Jamal...
Yeah.

You know,
that's Arabic for beauty,

and it is beautiful to see you.

It is so good to meet you,
Reverend.

I've admired you from afar.

Now you can do it up close.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Take a seat. Take a seat.

(JAMAL CLEARS THROAT)

How about I go first?

Please.

Now, as of the last poll,
you were down by 12 points.

Now it's nine. Margin
of error, could be seven.

Could also be 11, too.

Thought I was going first?

Election's in less than a month.

If I was a doctor,
I'd be telling you

to get your affairs in order.

Three weeks from now,
you won't need a doctor.

You'll be asking someone like
me to give you last rites.

So says you.

So says me.

Exactly. Me, the guy

with the largest congregation
in your ward

and an even larger outreach.

I've known the Mulligans
since I became a pastor.

No, he's not helping anybody.

Like I said, I know him.

the Mulligans. Can we go now?

I didn't say that.

The ward has been redrawn.

The Mulligans
weren't playing ball.

For the first time,
someone like us has a shot.

I'd be an idiot to ignore that.

I'm gonna cut to the chase
here, Reverend.

I'm in the driving seat, I just
don't have a set of wheels.

All I need is your endorsement
and your contribution

to help me
get across the finish line.

How much of a contribution
do you need?

And what's it worth to you?

You mean worth
in terms of funding?

I can fill you in on that,
but what matters

is that you're with us.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Okay, I gotta

Mommy loves you.

Hey, Ma, will you

I'll be back as soon

BREECHELLE: (IN DISTANCE)
You keep asking me,

asking me for money...
All right, bye.

So, I asked her,

how does she know it was true?
Who told her?

BREECHELLE: I'm tired of y'all
motherfuckers coming up here...

WOMAN: What the hell is that?
I don't know.

What'd you call me?

BREECHELLE: You deaf?
Motherfucker. Goodbye.

BELLE: What is going on?

Who was that,
and what does he want?

I don't want to talk about it.

Breechelle,
are you in trouble?

I said
I don't want to talk about it.

CLIENT: How long am I supposed
to be under this thing?

Thank you.

BELLE: I'm sorry

Oh, that's all right.

What are you drinking?

Just ginger ale.

Have you done this before?

Why should we

Because I'm the only one

Because I wouldn't ask you
to do anything

I wouldn't do myself.

Leave...

I'm in.

Like I said, this next job
is worth five million dollars.

From what I can tell
with Harry's notebook,

the money is either in a house

So the first thing
we're gonna need is a van.

Don't you have a car?
Probably a nice one.

The car is registered
to Harry. Think.

I'll buy a van.
Good. Progress.

What do I do?

Find out what this is

Your husband's
been dead a month.

Why are you being
such a bitch?

You're being a cunt.

Don't you say that word to me.

It's appropriate.
You're being a cunt.

A friend lets a friend know...

when she's being a cunt.
You're not a friend.

You're just a stupid girl
with nothing in your head.

I'm not stupid.

Then why don't you
keep your legs shut?

David is gonna help us.
Help us do what?

He thinks the blueprints
are a safe room.

He's gonna find out
where it is.

You idiot.
You're a cold, old bitch!


I'm done being
treated like shit.

Not again.

Not by you.

Not by anyone.

(BREATH TREMBLING)

They killed Bash.

Who did?

The Mannings.
What? How do you know?

I know.

I'm not Harry.

All this damage, I...

I can't be responsible
for all of it.

ALICE: Why do you have to be?

Because I don't own anything.

Not even
the apartment I live in.

I have nothing.

(VERONICA CRYING)

We can't tell Linda
about Bash.

She'll back out.

You need to find us
a new driver.

VERONICA: That's not easy.

LINDA: Don't you
know anyone else?

No! I'm working on it.

What have you been
doing all week?

She's had a rough time.

Yeah?
They wanna repo my home!

My bitch of a mother-in-law
wants to take away my kids.

What's your kids
and mother-in-law

have to do with me?

I gave you one job,
and you couldn't even do it,

so don't tell me
how to do mine!

If we fuck this up

I know what the consequences
of this shit look like.

Have either of you ever
been to a prison? Once?

I didn't think so.

Six days.

Find a fucking driver!


I know.

Veronica.

VERONICA: Can I come in?
AMANDA: Did you call?

VERONICA: No. Can I ask you
some questions?

AMANDA: Oh, sure. Of course.

Let me put Albert in his room.

Albert? Beautiful.
Thanks.

Can I put my dog down?
Sure, of course.

Um, this is actually not
a very good time for me.

The baby is really fussy today...

Did Jimmy tell you
about anyone else?

Someone who could drive a job?

Veronica, what are you doing?
Someone with some skills.

Maybe the person
who prepped his cars.

You need to leave this alone.

He's just happy that

He's retiring a wealthy man.

You know, your guys went
a little heavy

on the accelerants.

I was lucky to get away
with half of that.

I want the full amount, Harry.
One million, like we agreed.

I thought this was about
stopping the Mannings?

Don't think you can fuck me

Fuck, man! Come on!

How would I even...

Can I just bring it
home to you later?

Dad, I'm really about
to miss, like, half the game

if I have to turn around now.

I'm not saying
it's more important

than your anniversary.

I'm already on my way back
right now, Dad.

I'll be there in, like,
15 minutes or something.

Oh, fuck!

DAVID: Look what I found.

So I have to go to Shanghai
for a few nights.

There's a site we're

You wanna come?

To Shanghai?

You ever been?

Uh, no.

No. When?

Tomorrow.

I can't.

You can't?

I got commitments here.

I can't just drop everything
and fly to Shanghai.

My life's
different than yours.

It seems to me
if you can ask me

to get the address
off a permit, which I did,

then I can certainly ask you
to ditch your commitments

and fly with me to Shanghai
for a few days.

Or do overseas adventures
cost more?

Is everything
just a transaction?

They brought us these drinks,

next they're gonna
bring us the bill.

It's the way the world works,
as far as I'm concerned.

Sorry.

Next time.

Is that the one?

Yep.

Yes.

You don't have to run, you know.

Don't worry. I'd rather
be here on your dime

than sitting on that damn bus,
not making any money.


Belle, can you drive?

Why?

Solved our problem.

What's this?
LINDA: This is Belle.

She's fast, she's smart,
and she can drive.

Come on. We can't do this,

the three of us.
We need a driver.

This is not your place.
Please ask her to leave.

I'm standing here.
You can talk to me.

I don't know you.
You don't have to.

I'm happy to leave right now.

Wait. We need a driver.

You girls happy
to split your cut?

Split our cut?

It's equal or nothing.

You vouch for her?

I don't require a vouch.

We're gonna need another gun.
BELLE: I got my own.

You need to watch
how you talk to me.

If you're in, we need
to get you started right away.

Would you mind waiting here?
No.

Mr. Mulligan

He's in a meeting.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

your support. Bye-bye.

(PHONES RINGING)

MAN: Excuse me,
can I help you?

VERONICA: I was just looking

and I was just

Sure. You are?

I have a meeting
with Jack Mulligan.

Ma'am, there's
a restroom downstairs.

I can show you the way.

GUARD: You got a weak bladder
or something?

COP: My wife told me
I need to drink

eight glasses of water a day.
I guess...

JACK:
I'll tell you exactly why

I fired your campaign manager.

He told me we would get
the endorsement of Wheeler

and now the good reverend has
decided to sit this one out.

He doesn't get to do that.

TOM: Oh.
Let me get this straight.

You fire Hillsman.

He's been working with
our family for 30 years.

So you just
put a bullet in him.

When the polls drop to, what,
three percent? Why? Why?

I got a new guy coming on.
Black guy. British.

Black guy? Oh, really?
A black guy.

SIOBHAN: Gavin Cunningham.

What?
Gavin Cunningham.

Fuck me and fuck him!

Fuck you and fuck the fucking
horse you came in on!

You fucking asshole!

What a fucking
asshole you are!

Talk about loyalty. Hey!

Maybe I'll call the mayor
and tell him

we gotta have
this election tomorrow,

before things get any worse.
You won't call the mayor.

I will take care of Manning
at the debate,

and that will be the end of it.

Might I add,
running in your shadow

would be a hell of a lot easier

if there weren't piles of shit
scattered everywhere I walk!

Keep your fucking mouth shut,
or I'll fucking whip your ass!

Today!

I can still do it. Believe me.

Okay?


JFK, huh?

You think you're gonna
make things better.

They're not gonna be any better.

You think you're gonna change
things? Change them to what?

You're not gonna
change anything!

They'll never change
under you.

The only thing that matters

is that we survive.
That's all.

Look around you.
It's like Custer's Last Stand.

It's kill or be killed.

Now, listen to me, son.

Listen, we made this city.

We're not having it
taken away from us

by people
who come here illegally...

or by people who can't stop,
you know...

making babies.

That means staying in power...

at all costs. You got that?

Yeah?

You listen to me, Father.

I'm looking forward to the day
when all this bullshit is over

and I don't have to talk
to people like you.

Because...

Because you won't be
here anymore.


My son.


Boy.



You finished?
Yeah.

Okay.

Now, hear me.

Tell your redheaded
paperweight here...

to call Hillsman,
and hire him back.

Okay?

He's gonna make this
Gavin whatever, whoever,

your debate prep consultant.


You need to pick up your toys,
put them back in the box.

When you're done, we will
continue this conversation.

Eh?

Get the door.

My jacket.


Who are you?
I'm Veronica Rawlings.

We met a long time ago,

when I was lobbying
for the teachers' union.

I hope you can teach my son
better than I did.

Mrs. Rawlings, I don't think
you're on my schedule today.

I'm not sure
I have the time to sit.

You do. You absolutely do.

She's from the teachers'
union. All right?

Yeah, let's go.
We're leaving. Okay.

Sorry to interrupt,

Mr. Mulligan.
JACK: Yeah?

Taking the car to the garage.
I'll be back in a few hours.

Sure, John. Just see
Siobhan before you leave.

Mrs. Rawlings, please come in.

(GATE OPENING)

LINDA: Hmm.

I know that guy.

Seen him at the salon.

VERONICA: <i>When was the last
time you saw my husband?</i>

Before he died? (SIGHS)

It was a while.
I can't remember.

Why do you ask?

Jamal Manning threatened me.

He says Harry stole from him,

and he presented me
with the bill.

He wants his money.

I'm not sure I follow.

From what I understand,

we both have
a Jamal Manning problem.

You don't...

You don't live in my ward,
Mrs. Rawlings.

But if you're aware of a crime,

you should really
go to the police.

Mr. Mulligan, you said
whenever I needed help.

Now, your family's been involved
in Harry's life for many years.

When I say help...

I mean help.
I understand, but...

I'm not my father.

As you can see, the years
have taken a toll on him...

and I do not want to go down
that same road.

So with much
admiration and respect

for your late husband
and yourself, of course...

I don't see what I can do.

What I've learned
from men like my father...

and Harry...

is that you reap what you sow.

Let's hope so.

(GATE BUZZING OPEN)

("THERE IT IS" PLAYING)
<i>â™ª There it is â™ª</i>

BELLE: That guy who was here,
in the suit, who is he?

I told you, I don't want you
to get involved.

What do you mean?

BREECHELLE:
He works for someone.

So who really owns this salon?

How is that
any of your business?

What doesn't bother you
doesn't trouble you.

WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
Jack Mulligan?

<i>â™ª But I knew the answer to
why people fall in love â™ª</i>

He empowered me.

I am a female minority
business owner.

But the powers that be
take a very healthy cut.

So why do you stand for it?

Where exactly would you
like me to stand?

I needed money
to start a business,

he gave it to me,
and now I owe him.

No bank was gonna give me
any money. He did.

All I wanted to do was
have a business of my own

and this way I'm allowed
to think I have one.

Does that sound right to you?
Because it doesn't sound right

to me.
You got a customer

right over there.

BELLE: Two of the three
cameras at the back

are covered
by the construction.

ALICE: Mm-hmm.

LINDA: And what about
the codes for the safe room?

ALICE: Veronica's on it.

Why isn't she here?
Why are we

doing this by ourselves?
I don't know.

LINDA:
Why are we doing this anyway?

Wait, who's
watching your kids?

My mom.

So while you were
sitting her kids,

your mom was
watching your daughter?

I work two jobs.
What do you do for money?

I had Florek.

LINDA: I had a business.

ALICE: Did you know
what they did?

I thought I did.

If I asked, he'd hit me.

After a job, though,
he was nice.

What about Veronica?
You think she knew?

she knew everything.

(IMITATES VERONICA) "You girls
happy to split your cut?"

BELLE: What about this? "You
vouch for her?" (CHUCKLES)

She'd be a lot nicer if she

just took that stick
out of her ass.

VERONICA: You know why
we need a new driver?

The last one was killed.

So if you're not serious...

If this whole thing
goes wrong...

I just want my kids to know

that I didn't sit there
and take it.

I did something.

VERONICA: <i>Our go date
is in three days.</i>

The night of the debate.

Now, all of our work
is worth nothing

if we don't move
this money and fast.

The notebook says
five million dollars.

That's exactly
the amount of money

Mulligan was accused of taking
in commission kickbacks.

So over here we have
two million dollars.

Twenty Tupperware boxes.

Each box has 100,000 dollars
in 100-dollar bills.

It weighs 44 pounds.

Now, over here we have
two million dollars.

Forty Tupperware boxes.

Each box has 50,000 dollars
in 50-dollar bills.

It weighs 88 pounds.

I feel like I'm in school.

Tell me about it.
VERONICA: Okay, Linda.

That bag has the weight of

two million dollars
in hundred-dollar bills.

Put it on.

All right.

Run to the back
of that van and back.

This is nothing.
All that for this?

Now, Belle...
LINDA: That was easy.

Put that on.

Watch you back.
Bend your knees.

Okay, run to the back
of the van and back.

(GRUNTS)
Come on! Come on!


It's not funny now, is it?

And it won't be
if we get caught.

Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on, run!

LINDA: Get this thing
off of me. (PANTING)

Now, that bag had double
the weight of before.

Why the fuck
would you do that?

Because I had to think
of the best-case scenario

and the worst-case scenario.

We gotta move fast.

We gotta start thinking
like professionals.

We're in business together.

There's not gonna be
some cozy reunion.

After this job, we're done.

We have three days to look
and move like a team of men.

The best thing we have going
for us is being who we are.

Why?

Because no one thinks we have
the balls to pull this off.

Can I ask you a question?

As long as I can answer it
and still get to my meeting.

How come we
never go to your place?

My place?

That's your question?

I'd like to see how you live.

I could cook you dinner.
We could watch some TV.

Look, I really,
really like you, Alice.

I don't think I've ever been
this happy with a woman.

I truly do care about you.
I really do.

But I'm not your husband.

I know you're not.


Look, this is an arrangement,
okay? It's not a marriage.

I pay for things, and outta
that, you get a nice life.

I don't need you
to have a nice life.

Look, if I ended things
right now,

what would you do for money?

Excuse me?

My money, the way I live.

I'm offering you
a nice life, Alice.

You say "a life" like it's yours
to offer. But it's mine.

It's mine to be ashamed of
or be proud of.

Mine to fuck up or make good.
It's mine.

I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

I have to go.

Can I drop you somewhere?

I'll get where I need to go.

(DOOR CLOSES)

KEN: It's over.
It was a mistake.

VERONICA: I know the codes
change every day.

I need those codes, Ken.

I thought I was off the hook
now Harry's dead.

It'll be the third time
my alarm systems get hit.

People are asking questions.

You should have thought twice

before cheating
on your wife with your niece.

You made a choice.

Now, I'll go wait
at the gas station.

If you drive away,
I know you're out.

If you come to me
with the codes...

maybe you have a future.

Please, I'm begging you
as a human being.

Please! I can't!

(DOOR OPENS)

Mrs. Rawlings, I was
surprised to hear from you.

VERONICA:
I want you to listen to me.

Underneath this table
is a bag of money.

I want you to use that money

to help rebuild
the school library.

All I ask...

name it after Marcus.

VERONICA: Alice?

How you been?

<i>â™ª Bring us to
this bitter plane â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Only one of us â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who's gonna walk away? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here in the deep below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That only darkness
really knows â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm hoping for
a humble seed to grow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No, I won't surrender
to this hard hearted tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Though I know
the sun's gonna bring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The palest of light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And all that remains â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is everything that's gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This life is mine
so I'll carry on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm just trying to hold on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm falling
in the dark below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I feel I'm falling
in the big unknown â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here in the deep below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will rise â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will rise again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A humble seed will grow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I have to go back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To pull me from the wreck â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know it's not over yet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's no fire, no flame
on this cold, cold plane â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No way to measure my pain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm just trying to hold on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm falling
in the dark below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I feel I'm falling
in the big unknown â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will rise â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will rise â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will rise again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A humble seed will grow â™ª</i>
