<i>[YOUNG MAN]</i>
<i>BEAUTIFUL. ISN'T IT?</i>

<i>BUT LISTEN.</i>
<i>YOU HEAR IT?</i>
<i>[BUZZING]</i>

<i>I HEAR IT IN MY NIGHTMARES.</i>

<i>THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE FEDS,</i>

<i>WORKING THEIR UNMANNED</i>
<i>DRONES, SPENDING MORE MONEY</i>
<i>TRYING TO SHUT US DOWN</i>

<i>THAN THEY DID SEARCHING</i>
<i>FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN.</i>

<i>42 BILLION SPENT</i>
<i>IN THE WAR ON POT.</i>

<i>140 BUCKS</i>
<i>FROM EVERY ONE OF YOU</i>

<i>TO FIGHT A LITTLE GREEN HERB</i>
<i>MADE BY GOD THAT GROWS</i>
<i>IN THE SUN.</i>

<i>AND GOD DOESN'T</i>
<i>MAKE MISTAKES.</i>

GO! GO GO GO!

<i>I WOULD HAVE PERSONALLY</i>
<i>PAID 18 MILLION IN TAXES</i>

<i>ON THE ALMOST 60 MILLION</i>
<i>I MADE FROM THE MEDICINE</i>
<i>I SOLD.</i>

<i>BUT THEY NEVER ASKED,</i>
<i>SO I NEVER OFFERED.</i>

<i>I NEVER GOT THE BILL,</i>
<i>SO I DIDN'T PAY.</i>

<i>â™ª [REGGAE]</i>

<i>HERE'S THE SKINNY.</i>

<i>I WAS A SPONGY KID</i>
<i>FROM THE WRONG SIDE</i>
<i>OF THE LAKE.</i>

<i>A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.</i>
<i>THE LOST CAUSE.</i>

<i>THE INVISIBLE KID</i>
<i>WHOSE NAME YOU FORGET</i>

<i>BEFORE I EVEN FINISH</i>
<i>SAYING IT.</i>

<i>BUT I RAN A DISCIPLINED,</i>
<i>$68 MILLION A YEAR BUSINESS</i>

<i>AND EMPLOYED HUNDREDS</i>
<i>OF WAL-MART-SHOPPING,</i>
<i>EXXON-BUYING AMERICANS.</i>

<i>AND WE'D STILL BE</i>
<i>UP AND RUNNING,</i>

<i>TRYING TO COPE</i>
<i>WITH THE DEMAND,</i>
<i>IF MURDER AND MAYHEM</i>

<i>HADN'T ENTERED THE PICTURE.</i>
<i>BUT HEY,</i>

<i>YOU CAN'T PUT THE TOOTHPASTE</i>
<i>BACK IN THE TUBE, CAN YOU?</i>

<i>TOPHER MOVED TO IDAHO</i>
<i>FROM BOSTON WHEN HE WAS 15.</i>

<i>HE TOOK A LOT OF SHIT</i>
<i>FOR HIS BOSTON ACCENT</i>
<i>AND FOR BEING FULL OF SHIT.</i>

<i>BUT HE'S HAD MY BACK</i>
<i>EVER SINCE HE BEAT DOWN</i>
<i>BILLY "THE BULL" TURROW,</i>

<i>WHO USED TO GIVE ME</i>
<i>A DAILY THUMPING FOR AS LONG</i>
<i>AS I CAN REMEMBER.</i>

<i>WE HAD ONE BIG THING</i>
<i>IN COMMON. POT.</i>

<i>TALKING ABOUT IT, SMOKING IT,</i>
<i>LOOKING FOR MORE,</i>
<i>BETTER, CHEAPER.</i>

<i>YOU KNOW THE DEAL.</i>

<i>HE LIKED GETTING HIGH</i>
<i>ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DID,</i>

<i>AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT.</i>

<i>YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HALF</i>
<i>THE SHIT THAT COMES</i>
<i>OUT OF HIS MOUTH,</i>

<i>BUT TOPHER HAD GAME. HE'D</i>
<i>GET ME TO DO THINGS I WOULD</i>
<i>HAVE NEVER DONE ON MY OWN.</i>

<i>HE WAS MY BEST FRO.</i>

WHAT'S UP, MOTHERFUCKERS?

IS THIS A PARTY?

<i>IF I COULD ERASE ONE GUY</i>
<i>FROM THIS STORY, IT WOULD BE</i>
<i>BRENDAN BUTLER.</i>

<i>HE LOST THE PLOT YEARS AGO.</i>
<i>WENT TO SLEEP ON THE DIRT FLOOR</i>
<i>OF A KOREAN ORPHANAGE,</i>

<i>WOKE UP IN A MANSION</i>
<i>IN COEUR D'ALENE LAKE</i>

<i>WITH A SILVER SPOON</i>
<i>UP HIS ASS.</i>

<i>BUT NO GOOD DEED</i>
<i>GOES UNPUNISHED.</i>

<i>HE PAID HIS ADOPTED</i>
<i>DADDY WARBUCKS BACK</i>

<i>BY BECOMING THE BIGGEST,</i>
<i>BADDEST, LOUDEST</i>
<i>DRUG DEALER IN TOWN.</i>

<i>DEALT HIS OVERPRICED WEED</i>
<i>TO THE FRAT PACK</i>
<i>AT GONZAGA PREP.</i>

<i>US PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS</i>
<i>GOT THE STICKS AND SEEDS.</i>

<i>PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HIM</i>
<i>BEING AN HONORS STUDENT,</i>
<i>PERFECT S.A.T. SCORES.</i>

<i>BUT HE DID SOME</i>
<i>OF THE STUPIDEST SHIT</i>
<i>I'D EVER SEEN.</i>

<i>HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING WHEN HE</i>
<i>SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING.</i>

DO YOU THINK PEOPLE
WILL KNOW WHAT I AM?

WHO CARES? THE CHICKS
WILL HAVE TO ASK, RIGHT?

FOOT IN THE DOOR,
DICK IN THE WHORE.

JUST LET ME DO THE TALKING.
I'LL GET US IN.

ALL RIGHT.
NATE? IS THAT YOU?

HEY, ASHLI WITH AN "I."

OKAY, COOL.

<i>â™ª [RAP]</i>
<i>WHAT?</i>

WANG?

WHO THE FUCK THINKS
THEY CAN CALL ME WANG?

HUH? WHO THE FUCK THINKS
THEY CAN CALL ME WANG?

THESE TWO FUCKING CLOWNS.

I'M A FRIEND OF, UH,
DANIEL COX.

THIS ISN'T DANIEL COX'S
FUCKING PARTY.

YEAH. HE TOLD US ABOUT IT.
IT'S ALL GOOD, RIGHT? JUST--

TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?

OH, YOU GOT SOME BUD?
I GOT THESE.

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I VENTILATE YOU
IN YOUR--

FUCKING PUSSY BITCH.
PUSSY?

[GUNSHOTS FIRE]
WHO'S A PUSSY BITCH?

YOU'RE A FUCKING PUSSY BITCH.

<i>I DON'T KNOW IF FREAKO BANDITO</i>
<i>WAS REALLY SHOOTING AT US,</i>

<i>BUT I WASN'T LOOKING BACK</i>
<i>TO FIND OUT.</i>

DON'T FUCK WITH ME.
YOU FUCKING PRICK.

NICE FUCKING COSTUME.
FUCK YOU.

HEY.

CAN WE MAKE THIS A FOUR-WAY?

<i>BUT THE TRUTH WAS,</i>
<i>WE WERE BOTH LOSERS</i>
<i>BY LEGACY.</i>

<i>I WENT TO BED SICK AND TIRED</i>
<i>OF BEING SICK AND TIRED.</i>

<i>TIRED OF MY MOM</i>
<i>WORKING SHITTY JOBS,</i>

<i>DRIVING A SHITTY CAR,</i>
<i>LIVING IN A SHITTY HOUSE,</i>

<i>JUST TO PROVIDE THREE HOTS</i>
<i>AND A COT FOR ME</i>
<i>AND MY LITTLE BRO.</i>

<i>BUT EVERY CHUNK OF COAL</i>
<i>WANTS TO BE A DIAMOND, RIGHT?</i>

<i>YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK</i>
<i>IS WRONG WITH POT? NOTHING.</i>

<i>WOULD YOU RATHER BE</i>
<i>IN A ROOM FULL OF DRUNKS</i>
<i>OR POT SMOKERS?</i>

<i>GIVE ME THE POT SMOKERS</i>
<i>EVERY TIME.</i>

<i>LAID BACK AND FRIENDLY.</i>

<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME</i>
<i>A BAR FIGHT BROKE OUT</i>
<i>BETWEEN POTHEADS?</i>

<i>DRIVE DRUNK, YOU THINK</i>
<i>YOU'RE DOING 30 AND YOU'RE</i>
<i>REALLY DOING 90.</i>

<i>DRIVE HIGH, YOU THINK</i>
<i>YOU'RE DOING 90 AND YOU'RE</i>
<i>REALLY DOING 30.</i>

<i>YOU STOP AT RED LIGHTS TWICE.</i>

<i>MOTHER NATURE PRODUCES POT.</i>
<i>MAN MAKES LIQUOR.</i>

<i>WHO DO YOU TRUST? SERIOUSLY,</i>
<i>THE PIZZA I USED TO DELIVER'S</i>
<i>KILLED MORE PEOPLE</i>

<i>THAN ALL THE WEED EVER SMOKED</i>
<i>IN THE STATE OF IDAHO.</i>

MOM AWAKE?

YOU REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK?
YEAH.

ALL RIGHT. HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

MOM?

MA, IT'S TIME TO GET UP.

TIME TO GET UP. COME ON.

WHAT TIME IS IT?
7:45. YOU GOTTA GO TO WORK.

<i>I'D BEEN WORKING MINIMUM WAGE</i>

<i>AND ALWAYS WILL.</i>

<i>DELIVERING PIZZAS,</i>
<i>SHOVELING SNOW,</i>
<i>BAGGING GROCERIES,</i>

<i>TRIMMING TREES,</i>
<i>WHATEVER I COULD HUSTLE.</i>

<i>IN COEUR D'ALENE, THERE WAS</i>
<i>MONEY ALL AROUND,</i>
<i>BUT JUST OUT OF REACH.</i>

<i>TEASING, TAUNTING,</i>
<i>JUST LAUGHING AT YOU</i>
<i>FOR THINKING</i>

<i>YOU WERE GONNA GET YOUR HANDS</i>
<i>ON ANY OF IT.</i>

OH, NO, I CAN'T.

I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

LIKE YOU'D HATE TO LOSE

'CAUSE PASSING THAT

YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
WHAT MAKES MOST WOMEN

FEAR THE COCK. OKAY.

GET IN THERE.

HAHA. OH, EASY, SPEED RACER.

THAT'S 600 A HALF
IF YOU CAN FIND IT.

SIX HUNDRED A HALF?

HOLY SHIT. SORRY.

YES, IT IS.

YOU SEE THE GROUND SQUIRREL
ON THE BED THERE?

SHE BOUGHT HERSELF A DIVORCE,
A NEW SET OF TITS,

AND PUT HER KID
THROUGH PRIVATE SCHOOL,

ALL BY BRINGING DOWN
A FEW POUNDS EVERY MONTH.

DOWN FROM WHERE?

FROM CANADA, BRO.
HOW?

DON'T GET ME WRONG,
TIGHT PUSSY IS VERY, VERY NICE,

CAN YOU BREAK A BENJAMIN?

THEN ALL I HAVE IS A 20.

HUH? WE GOT A DEAL, NATE?

THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO, SIR.

LET ME GRAB THAT.
IT'S A WRITE-OFF.

NOW, SHOULDN'T YOU BE TOODLING
OFF BACK TO PIZZA BASE CAMP?

HMM?

GOOD TO MEET YOU, NATE.

SAY HI TO THE BIG-TITTED
REDHEAD FOR ME.

GIRLS!

WE GOT PIE.
WOO!

<i>IT WAS LIKE I'D BEEN LIVING</i>
<i>MY ENTIRE LIFE IN A FOG,</i>

<i>AND THAT NIGHT</i>
<i>IT FINALLY LIFTED.</i>

<i>LIKE DONALD TRUMP SAYS,</i>

<i>"IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY,</i>
<i>STICK WITH WHAT YOU LOVE</i>
<i>AND KNOW."</i>

[KNOCKING, DOOR OPENS]

HEY.
OH, HEY, MA. YOU'RE LATE.

YEAH. SOME YUPPIES
RAN OUT ON THEIR BILL,

I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

SORRY. DIDN'T MEAN
TO WEIRD YOU OUT.

SO?

SO.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?

UH, MARIJUANA.

I HAVE A FRIEND WHO--
KIND OF A FRIEND,

THAT HE OR SHE

MAY-MAY-MAY BE INTERESTED

IN, UH, IN THE BUSINESS.

SO, YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW MUCH TIME YOU WOULD DO

IF YOU GET POPPED
DEALING WEED.

UM, NOT-NOT DEALING.
TRANSPORTING.

NOT-NOT ME, THOUGH.
TRAFFICKING?

YEAH, BUT ONCE AGAIN,
NOT ME, MY FRIEND.

UH, MIGHT BE DOING IT.

MAYBE.
WELL, THERE ARE
A LOT OF VARIABLES.

HOW MUCH WEIGHT? ARE YOU
CROSSING STATE LINES?

ARE YOU CARRYING A FIREARM?
IS THIS A FEDERAL CASE
OR A STATE CASE?

IF IT'S A STATE CASE,
WHICH STATE AND WHO'S
THE JUDGE?

DO YOU HAVE ANY PRIORS?

THE CRITICAL ELEMENT IN
WHETHER YOU WALK AWAY

OR YOU'RE THERE TO STAY
IS HAVE YOU STASHED
ENOUGH MONEY

TO PAY MY FEE?

OH. OKAY.

HOW MUCH WEED DO YOU THINK
WAS SOLD IN AMERICA LAST YEAR?

I DON'T KNOW. NOT ENOUGH.

COME ON, MAN. HOW MUCH?

TWO MILLION POUNDS.
NO.

FIFTY MILLION POUNDS?
NO. NO.

I DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH?
ALL OF IT.

I MEAN, THE MARKET IS HUGE.
IT'S INFINITE.

AND YOU KNOW WHO SELLS
THE SWEETEST, DANKEST
PURPLE-HAIR BUDS

IN THE WHOLE WESTERN WORLD?
WHAT'S WITH THE 20
FREAKING QUESTIONS?

DUDE, MAN, CANADA.
EVERY MA AND PA KETTLE
IN CANADA'S A GROWER.

YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
NO, NATE. ENLIGHTEN ME.

IF YOU GET CAUGHT GROWING,
SLAP ON THE WRIST.
NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.

IT'S LIKE A SPEEDING TICKET
OR AN OVERDUE LIBRARY BOOK.

WE DON'T LIVE IN CANADA.
IT'S A HUNDRED MILES
AWAY, DUDE.

THE BORDER'S WIDE OPEN.
THE BORDER'S N--

IF THE BORDER'S WIDE OPEN, WHY
DID RONNIE PRICE GET POPPED

WITH A HALF A POUND COMING HOME
FROM A HOCKEY TOURNAMENT
IN VANCOUVER?

DUMBASS, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT DRIVING IT
ACROSS THE BORDER.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I'M TALKING ABOUT WALKING
ACROSS THE 5,000 MILES
THEY'RE NOT WATCHING.

YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE
NOT WATCHING.
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT WATCHING.

OKAY. MY DAD SAYS IF ANYONE
DEALS WITH DRUGS,

YOU BETTER GET RICH QUICK,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET
CAUGHT IN THE END.

OH, YEAH? YOU KNOW
WHAT MY DAD SAYS?

NOTHING, 'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ONE, SO I GOTTA MAKE IT
ON MY OWN.

I'M TALKING ABOUT POT HERE.

THOMAS JEFFERSON
AND GEORGE WASHINGTON GREW IT.

COLUMBUS'S SAILS WERE MADE
OUT OF IT. I MEAN, EVEN
THE FIRST PAIR OF LEVIS

WERE MADE OUT OF IT, MAN.
YOU TALK SO MUCH SHIT FOR A KID

WHO DIDN'T GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL.

I'M SAYING WE COULD
BRING IN A FEW POUNDS,

GET THE 50 LARGE WE NEED

KEEP IT SMALL,
JUST BETWEEN US.

IN AND OUT, SHORT AND SWEET,

YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH TIME WE WOULD
DO IF WE GOT CAUGHT?

I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH TIME.

KEEP IT UNDER FIVE POUNDS,
NO WEAPONS, NO PRIORS?

WE'D DO A YEAR. BE OUT

YEAH, LET'S GO AGAIN. READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.

<i>â™ª [RAP CONTINUES]</i>

<i>I'D NEVER RAN AS FAST</i>

<i>WE RAN LIKE KENYAN</i>
<i>TRACK STARS ON METH.</i>

<i>LIKE WE WERE BEING CHASED BY</i>
<i>H.I.V-POSITIVE, FLESH-EATING</i>
<i>ZOMBIES ON MOTOCROSS BIKES.</i>

<i>WE WERE JUST WAITING</i>
<i>FOR THE SIRENS TO GO OFF,</i>

<i>THE HELICOPTERS TO COME</i>
<i>SWOOPING OUT OF THE SKY,</i>

<i>FOR THE LASERS AND NINJAS</i>
<i>WITH SEARCHLIGHTS.</i>

<i>WAITING FOR ALL THE SHIT</i>
<i>TO FLY OUT OF THE SKY,</i>

<i>BUT SURPRISE, SURPRISE,</i>

<i>IT NEVER DID.</i>

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I HAVE NO IDEA, MAN.

IS IT CANADA?
COULD BE.

CAN'T SEE ANY FUCKING CARS.

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

<i>WE NEEDED STARTUP CAPITAL,</i>

<i>NOW WE HAD TO GET THE SUPPLY.</i>

<i>IF WE HAD REAL WEIGHT</i>
<i>IN HIGH-GRADE ROCK STAR WEED,</i>

<i>THE SKY WAS THE LIMIT.</i>

<i>SO WE WENT BACK UP TO CANADA,</i>
<i>LOOKING FOR A GOOD CONNECT.</i>

DON'T SLOW DOWN.
JUST DRIVE NORMAL.

WHY WOULDN'T I DRIVE NORMAL?
THERE'S A COP.

WHO CARES? IT'S A COP.
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

HE'S DOING HIS JOB.
DON'T DRIVE TOO FAST.

DON'T SLOW DOWN.
I'M NOT SLOWING DOWN.

<i>[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]</i>

WHY ARE THEY FUCKING--

[SIREN WAILS]

OH, SHIT.

MIGHT AS WELL PULL OVER HERE,
WHERE IT'S SAFE.

DRIVE FORWARD MORE.

NO STUPID, FUCKING,
JUVENILE JOKES.

LICENSE, REGISTRATION.

HEY. CAN'T ACTUALLY FIND
THE REGISTRATION, I'VE HAD
THIS THING SO MANY YEARS.

WERE WE DOING
ANYTHING WRONG, OFFICER?

YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR SEATBELT.

YOU FUCKER.

SORRY ABOUT THAT, OFFICER.

WHERE YOU BOYS HEADED?

CRESTON.

YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO VISIT
A FRIEND IN CRESTON.

WHERE DOES YOUR FRIEND LIVE?

UH, HIGH NEAR THE SCHOOL--
RIGHT NEAR THE HIGH SCHOOL, SIR.

BY THE HIGH SCHOOL.
YELLOW HOUSE, I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE NAME OF THE STREET,

BUT I KNOW HOW TO GET THERE
ONCE I SEE THE SCHOOL.

THERE'S A STEEPLE
SOMEWHERE, I THINK.

YOU REMEMBER
YOUR FRIEND'S NAME?

Y--
YEP.

WHAT IS IT?
UH, MICHEL, BUT IT'S A DUDE.

YEAH, MEE-CHEL.
YEAH, HE'S RUSSIAN.

FRENCH. UH, BOTH.
BOTH.

RUSSIAN.
YES.

IF YOU BOYS ARE LOOKING
TO SCORE SOME WEED,

YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

YOU WANT TO GET ON 36,
GO NORTH TO NELSON.

THAT'S WHERE CANADA GROWS
ITS FINEST GREEN.

UH, OKAY.

YOU BOYS HAVE
A REALLY GOOD DAY.

WEAR YOUR SEATBELTS.
THANKS A LOT.

DID HE JUST TELL US--

[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

GO, GO. BE COOL.
IS HE FUCKING WITH US?

THIS IS AWESOME.
CANADA'S THE COOLEST.

YES, $8. GO WILD.
ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT.

SMELLS GOOD.

TASTES GOOD, TOO.

YOU WANT A BITE?

ISN'T THERE SOME SHIT
ABOUT SMOKING AT A GAS STATION?

MY DAD OWNS THE GAS STATION.

HUH. SO HE'S

COOL WITH HIS HOTTEST DAUGHTER
JUST BLOWING HERSELF UP?

DO YOU WANT TO WRITE
A FUCKING REPORT?

DO YOU WANT A HIT?

I DON'T WANT TO WRITE
A REPORT.

I'M TOPHER.

NICOLE.

NATE, COME HERE, SEXY.

OH, THIS IS MY BUDDY, DARREN.

WHAT'S UP, DUDE?
THIS IS MY BOY NATE.

HE'S KIND OF SHY
AROUND WHITE GIRLS.

FUCK YOU, I'M SHY.
HI. NATE. PLEASURE.

NICOLE. DON'T BE SHY
AROUND ME, NATE.

I'M AN EASY GIRL
TO GET TO KNOW.

HOLY SHIT, THIS IS
BOMB-ASS CHRONIC.

YOU WANT TO TAKE SOME
HOME WITH YOU?

UH...
YEAH.

YEAH. WE, UH, HOW MUCH?
HOW MUCH WE TALKING?

HOW MUCH YOU LOOKING FOR?

A LOT.

<i>â™ª [RAP, ON CAR RADIO]</i>

<i>WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE</i>
<i>SUSPECTED A SET-UP.</i>

<i>I WOULD HAVE CLAIMED</i>
<i>ENTRAPMENT.</i>

<i>BUT YOU DON'T GET MANY</i>
<i>SECOND CHANCES IN LIFE.</i>

<i>OR FIRST CHANCES,</i>
<i>FOR THAT MATTER.</i>

<i>WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY</i>
<i>LIKE NICOLE COMES ALONG,</i>

<i>YOU BETTER BE READY</i>
<i>TO JUMP ON</i>
<i>AND BITE DOWN HARD.</i>

COME ON.

HEY, MOM.

THIS IS, UH, TOPHER AND--

NATE.
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
PLEASURE.

NATE? HOW ARE YOU?
NOT BAD.

THAT'S MY LITTLE SISTER ELLA.

HI, ELLA.
HEY THERE.

HOW ARE YOU?

THESE BOYS ARE LOOKING
FOR SOME BUDS.

SWEET. OKAY, HOLD ON.

JOHN! THESE BOYS
COME A-LOOKING.

AROUND HERE.

ALMOST THERE, FELLOWS.
LET'S GO.

LITTLE CORNER HERE.
WATCH YOUR HEADS. LOW BRIDGE.

NOW WE'RE STEPPING UP.
LET'S GO. STEP UP.

UP, UP.
THERE YOU GO.

ALL RIGHT, LOSE THE MASKS.

COME ON IN.

EVER SEEN
A VEGGING ROOM BEFORE?

NO.
WELL, WELCOME THEN.

THIS IS A COMPLETELY
CONTROLLED AND SEALED
ENVIRONMENT.

TEMPERATURE, CO2, HUMIDITY.
IT'S ALL CONTROLLED.

GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM IT.
WE USE ROCKWOOL

AND THESE PUFFED LAVA ROCKS.
THERE YOU GO.

PLANTS ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

LET ME SHOW YOU
THE FLOWERING ROOM.

WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TOUCH
THOSE YELLOW THINGS.

WHY NOT?
WHOLE PLACE WILL BLOW UP.

REALLY?

NO. THEY'RE FLY TRAPS.

I HAVE BEEN SELECTING
INDICA MOTHERS

AND CROSS-BREEDING THEM
WITH MOSTLY INDICA MALE PLANTS.

AND THIS, OH, THIS IS

MY MASTERPIECE.

TOOK ME ALMOST 20 YEARS
TO DEVELOP THIS STRAIN.

THE HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT
IS WHAT GETS THE GREAT
BUD COLOR.

THIS DURGA MATA,
SHE'S A HYBRID

OF TWO DIFFERENT
SHIVA STRAINS.

I GET ONE FROM A U.S.
GOVERNMENT LABORATORY.

LOOK AT THAT THICK STEM,
WILL YOU?

SHORT INNER LOAVES,
LONG, POINTY FINGERS.

STRONG VEINS.

TIGHT, TIGHT BUD CLUSTERS.

I LOVE THE FROSTY LOOK,
DON'T YOU?

FUCKING LOVE IT.
LOOKS AMAZING.

GO AHEAD, TAKE
A BIG SMELL.
YEAH?

YEAH.

ENORMOUSLY HIGH THC.

VERY SWEET, HASHY TASTE.

AND IT FINISHES
WITH A CHRISTMAS CAKE MIX

OF TROPICAL, FRUITY FLAVORS.

MANATUSHKA THUNDERFUCK
AND SILVER KUSH, SEE,

CAN'T EVEN CARRY
THIS BUD'S JOCKSTRAP.

IT'S TWO DIFFERENT UNIVERSES.

THEY'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE FUCKING SAME REALITY.

LOOK AT ME.

THE SHIT THAT WE GROW HERE
IS FUCKING INSANE.

THIS IS THE HEALTHIEST
THC DELIVERY SYSTEM
THAT YOU CAN USE.

YOU UNDERSTAND,
IT DOESN'T BURN

THE LEAVES, IT JUST
HEATS THEM UP ENOUGH

TO RELEASE AND ACTIVATE
THE THC.

SO, IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE
INHALING COOL AIR,

WITH A LIGHT KIND
OF CANDY CORN TASTE.

TRUST ME, WHEN YOU SMOKE
AS MUCH AS WE DO,

IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

YEAH. I MEAN, YOUR LUNGS
ARE THE GATEWAY
TO THE BLOODSTREAM,

AND THEY HAVE TO LAST
YOU A LIFETIME.

JOHN USED TO BE
A TWO PACK A DAY SMOKER

WHEN WE MET.
YOU ARE A GODDESS,

AND YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

OF COURSE, BABY.
YOU BOYS DON'T SMOKE
CIGARETTES, DO YOU?

HE DOES.
THAT'S A NASTY HABIT.

I MEAN, THOSE THINGS ARE
JUST FULL OF CHEMICALS.

WE DON'T LET NICKY
DATE SMOKERS, DO WE?

YEAH, I ACTUALLY JUST QUIT.

HEY. HEY, UH,

YOU MIND IF I
GET ANOTHER SLUG?

EASY THERE, KILLER.

THIS ISN'T THAT MEXI SCHWAG
YOU'RE USED TO SMOKING.

IT WILL DROP YOU LIKE OWL SHIT
ON THE FOREST FLOOR.

DAD, STOP BRAGGING.
NICOLE, BABY,

IT'S NOT BRAGGING
IF IT'S THE TRUTH.

THE THC CONTENT IN HERE IS,
WHAT, 25 PERCENT?

YOUR HEAD'S USED TO SEVEN.

COLEY BEAR, YOU WANT TO SWIRL
DOWN A LITTLE MAGIC?

YES.

OH, THANKS FOR ASKING ME.

OH, COME ON, MAMA BEAR,
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
ALWAYS INCLUDED.

YOUR DADDY'S FAVORITE GIRL.
OH, I BETTER BE
DADDY'S ONLY GIRL.

SOMEONE'S GONNA GET
LAID TONIGHT.

WHO?

THIS IS PRETTY STRANGE,
HUH, KID?

WE DON'T DEAL
IN SMALL QUANTITY.

NOTHING LESS THAN
A HUNDRED A RUN,
$1600 A POUND.

TRUST ME, IT'S IN BOTH
OF OUR BEST INTERESTS.

YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO KEEP
YOUR RISK-REWARD RATIO
NICE AND HIGH.

CAN YOU DEAL
WITH THAT KIND OF STOCK?

REMEMBERING THAT
EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION
IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS

FOR ALL OF US IN THIS BUSINESS.

THE ONLY SURE THING
IS THE DEMAND.

THE REST OF IT IS JUST PLAIN,
OLD-FASHIONED HARD WORK.

YOU'RE PREACHING AGAIN.

NO. BUT, HONEY, THIS IS
IMPORTANT. AND LET ME
TELL THEM WHY.

BECAUSE WHEN THE MONEY COMES,

WHEN IT REALLY, REALLY
STARTS TO COME,

WELL, SOMETIMES, BOYS,
IT IS HARD TO KEEP
YOUR GO KART ON THE TRACK.

ACTUALLY, WE WERE THINKING
MORE LIKE 300 POUNDS.

EXCUSE ME?

CAN YOU GET
THAT MANY ABLE BODIES?

SERIOUS SOLDIERS
WITH SOFT, GOLDEN HEARTS?

IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
PEOPLE WHO YOU WOULD
BLIND TRUST

IN A FOREST FIRE
OR FIREFIGHT.
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

THESE ARE GUYS I GREW UP WITH.

THEY'RE MY BROTHERS
BUT FROM DIFFERENT MOTHERS.

WELL, LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS.

DRUG SMUGGLING-- YES.
THAT DAMN SURE IS WHAT IT IS--

REQUIRES MORE COOL,
MORE INTEGRITY

THAN ANY OTHER BUSINESS.
SO MUCH IS DONE ON A WINK
AND A HANDSHAKE.

AND IF YOU DID GET BUSTED,
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY
WAS JEALOUS.

THEY RATTED YOU OUT.
SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE.

SOMEONE ON YOUR FIRST-STRING
TEAM, ALL FULL OF BEER

AND BULLSHIT, WHO HAS NO IDEA
WHAT COOL REALLY MEANS.

CLINT EASTWOOD.
CLINT EASTWOOD IS COOL.

TWELVE TO TWENTY WORDS
A PICTURE, NO NEED TO BRAG,

NO NEED TO BOAST.

AND IF YOU'RE NOT HUMBLE,

START FLASHING YOUR HUBRIS,
WITH YOUR CANDY APPLE RED--

DADDY, SHUT UP.
YOU'RE WAY TOO STONED--

YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FUCKING WELL AM.

I THINK THAT WE SHOULD JUST
KEEP IT SMALL AT FIRST.

WE CAN HANDLE IT.

AND I APPRECIATE IT.

BETTER TO HEAR IT NOW THAN TO
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT LATER.

WE DON'T FRONT PRODUCT.

WE'RE STRICTLY CASH AND CARRY.

IT KEEPS THE AIR
BETWEEN US CLEAN AND PURE.

I UNDERSTAND.

THREE HUNDRED POUNDS?

HOW FUCKING HIGH ARE YOU?

SERIOUSLY, WHAT TYPE
OF TONY MONTANA, BIPOLAR SHIT
ARE YOU ON RIGHT NOW?

BECAUSE YOU ALMOST HAD
A FUCKING HEART ATTACK

CROSSING THE BORDER CARRYING
NOTHING BUT YOUR OWN WEIGHT.

NOW YOU WANT TO DO
300 POUNDS A RUN?

WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE GONNA
GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?

I'LL GET IT.
OH, YOU'LL GET IT.

YEAH.
YOU GOT A FUCKING
OIL WELL SOMEWHERE

IN YOUR BACKYARD YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT?

LOOK, DUDE, THIS IS
OUR BIG CHANCE, AND IT
MAY BE OUR ONLY ONE,

SO WE HAVE TO TAKE IT. OKAY?

THREE HUNDRED POUNDS
WILL GET YOU $640,000.

THAT'S 3.8 MILLION IN A WEEK,
AND THAT'S TAKING SUNDAY OFF
FOR A LITTLE PRAYER, OKAY?

CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?
FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE--

BOYS, WHY DON'T YOU STAY OVER?

YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
TO DRIVE.

SERIOUSLY, IT'S ALL GOOD.
COME ON.

ALL RIGHT.

<i>THANK GOD SHE CAME OUT</i>
<i>WITH THE INVITE,</i>

<i>BECAUSE RIGHT THEN,</i>
<i>I COULDN'T HAVE DRIVEN</i>
<i>A BISCUIT</i>

<i>INTO A PLATE FULL OF GRAVY.</i>


<i>I'M ALL FOR MIXING</i>
<i>BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE,</i>

<i>BUT I KNEW IF THIS BUSINESS</i>
<i>GOT DONE AND DONE RIGHT,</i>

<i>THERE WOULD BE MORE PLEASURE</i>
<i>THAN ANY OF US COULD HANDLE</i>
<i>WITHOUT A SPOTTER.</i>

<i>THANK GOD TOPHER</i>
<i>WAS TOO DUMB</i>

<i>TO SLOP ON THE ONE CONDOM</i>
<i>HE BROUGHT,</i>

<i>BECAUSE I NEEDED IT</i>
<i>TO GET THE SAMPLE WEED</i>
<i>BACK ACROSS THE BORDER.</i>

<i>I NEVER REALLY TESTED</i>
<i>MY GAG REFLEX BEFORE,</i>

<i>BUT FUCK ME IF</i>
<i>THE BANANA TASTE IN LUBRICANT</i>

<i>DIDN'T MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE</i>
<i>LIKE A SICK PUPPY.</i>

FUCK.

HELLO, MR. NORMAN.
HI.

RIGHT OVER
TO SECONDARY INSPECTION.

GREAT.

<i>THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME</i>
<i>I EVER DROVE PRODUCT</i>
<i>ACROSS THE BORDER.</i>

<i>I HAD AN EIGHTH OF DURGA MATA</i>
<i>IN MY LOWER INTESTINE</i>

<i>'CAUSE I KNEW I'D NEED IT</i>

<i>I JUST HOPED IT SMELLED</i>
<i>AND SMOKED SWEET AFTER</i>

<i>AND THAT THEY WEREN'T</i>

DROP THEM.

I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSITION

<i>BARRY LERNER.</i>
<i>NOT HIS REAL NAME, FYI.</i>

<i>BUT SOMEONE I HEARD ABOUT</i>
<i>THROUGH THIS GUY WHO</i>
<i>USED TO RUN FOR BUTLER.</i>

<i>REMEMBER WHEN I SAID BUTLER</i>
<i>SHOULD HAVE DONE LESS TALKING</i>

<i>FEDS HAVE BEEN TRYING</i>
<i>TO NAIL BARRY FOR YEARS.</i>

<i>AND IF I HAD ROLLED ON HIM,</i>
<i>I WOULDN'T BE</i>
<i>WHERE I AM TODAY.</i>

<i>BUT HE KEPT HIS WORD,</i>
<i>AND I KEPT MINE.</i>

CAN I GET YOU
ANOTHER SODA?

UH, SURE.
ANYTHING ELSE?

UH, YEAH. COULD I HAVE
A BEER SENT OVER
TO BARRY LERNER OVER THERE?

UH, WHAT KIND OF BEER?

WHAT DO YOU GOT?
WE HAVE A LOT
OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEERS.

JUST GET WHAT

AND SEND IT
OVER TO HIM, PLEASE.

ALL RIGHT, SIX BUCKS.
OKAY.

TWO, THREE, SIX,
AND AS A BONUS--

HERE'S SOME CHANGE.
BALLER.

THANK YOU.

<i>BARRY WAS FROM ISRAEL.</i>

<i>NOT THE BEACHES</i>
<i>WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS PART,</i>

<i>BUT THE MUNICH REVENGE PART.</i>

<i>HE'D BEEN CHARGED</i>
<i>WITH FIVE COUNTS OF MURDER</i>

<i>AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,</i>
<i>BUT NEVER GOT CLOSE</i>
<i>TO BEING CONVICTED.</i>

<i>HE BROUGHT ECSTASY IN</i>
<i>FROM THE COAST OF PORTUGAL,</i>

<i>COCAINE FROM SOUTH PERU,</i>
<i>AND FUNNELED MONEY</i>

<i>FROM THE STREETS</i>
<i>OF THE NORTHWEST</i>
<i>INTO HIS ACCOUNTS.</i>

<i>BUT HIS REAL LOVE</i>
<i>AND PASSION WAS WEED.</i>

IT'S FROM THAT KID
WITH THE GLASSES.

HEY. UH, BARRY?

HOW ARE YOU?

DO I KNOW YOU?
NATE NORMAN.

DO I KNOW YOU?

I KNOW YOU DO BUSINESS
WITH BRENDAN BUTLER.

WHAT THE FUCK
IS WITH BRENDAN BUTLER?

IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.

I'M NOT A COP OR ANYTHING.

KNOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE.

LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR TABLE
AND LEAVE ME ALONE?

"I AM NOT A COP."

I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
FOR YOU, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO HEAR ME OUT.

I HAVE CELL PHONE STORES.

DO YOU NEED A NEW PHONE?

UNHAPPY WITH YOUR PLAN?

NO.
THEN WE HAVE NO BUSINESS

WHAT DO YOU WANT?
<i>[TOPHER]</i>
<i>WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?</i>

<i>NATE, WHO IS THAT?</i>
<i>I GOTTA GO.</i>

OKAY.

BARRY BOUGHT A DANCE FOR YOU.

<i>I KNEW WHAT BARRY</i>
<i>WAS DOING.</i>

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?

<i>HE WAS USING HER</i>
<i>TO GET ALL MY INFO</i>

<i>AND CHECKING TO SEE</i>
<i>IF I WAS WEARING A WIRE.</i>

<i>THE GUY WAS THOROUGH, SHARP,</i>
<i>AND AS DETAILED</i>
<i>AS A ROCKET LAUNCH.</i>

<i>AND I WAS GLAD HE WAS.</i>
<i>STAND UP.</i>

OKAY.
<i>HIS ASS WAS MY ASS</i>
<i>IF THIS ALL TURNED TO SHIT,</i>

<i>AND LET'S BE HONEST, I DIDN'T</i>
<i>KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING.</i>

BARRY SAYS IF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY TO HIM,

YOU CAN TELL ME.

JUST TALK, MR. BIG COCK.

THE CLOCK IS RUNNING.

HI, BARRY.

HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

THIS IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING
BRENDAN EVER BROUGHT ME.

I HAVE A MUCH BETTER CONNECT
THAN BRENDAN WILL EVER HAVE.

OH, YEAH?

LOOK, I'M HONEST
AND DEPENDABLE,

AND I WILL NEVER RUN MY MOUTH
OFF THE WAY BRENDAN DOES.

THE ONLY REASON I EVEN
KNOW ABOUT YOU

IS BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
FULL OF BEER AND BULLSHIT.

TALKING ABOUT CRIMPING YOU

AND RUNNING WITH YOUR MONEY
OR WHATEVER GHETTO SHIT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

HMM.

THAT IS $666,000.

FOR 300 POUNDS.

IT'S 2600 A POUND.
I'M PAYING 2200.

OKAY.

CAN I TRUST YOU, NATE?

YEAH.

YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

YOU UNDERSTAND WHO I AM?

DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

THIS GOES BEYOND TRUST.

THIS IS A SECOND MORTGAGE.

ON YOUR LIFE.

IF YOU WERE TO BURN ME,

IT WOULD BE
A VERY BAD DAY FOR YOU.

AND FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE
YOU KNOW.

I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

PHILLIP TO RAISE HIS GRADES
IN MR. HARRIS'S HISTORY CLASS.

I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
YOUR MOTHER

NOT HAVE TO REFILL COFFEE
FOR A LIVING.

YEAH.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND

HOW EASY IT WOULD BE

TO BURY 170 POUNDS
OF ROTTING MEAT

WHERE NO ONE WILL
EVER FIND IT?

I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
MY WORDS HERE.

I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT
IN YOUR MIND.

AND I WANT YOU TO LET IT GUIDE

YOUR ACTIONS.

I WILL.

POPPY.

I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, SON.

GO.

YES, VIDAL. WE'LL GO
TO THE BEACH.

WE GO TO THE BEACH NOW, OKAY?

YOU AND POPPY.

<i>NOW THAT I HAD THE TOP-SHELF</i>
<i>FINANCING SECURED,</i>

<i>IT WAS TIME TO ASSEMBLE</i>
<i>MY "A" TEAM.</i>

<i>BUT WHAT I NEEDED MOST</i>
<i>WAS FOR THEM TO BE</i>
<i>MINE, 100 PERCENT.</i>

<i>ONE WEAK LINK</i>
<i>AND MY SHIP WOULD SINK.</i>

<i>TURNED OUT I WAS GONNA</i>
<i>HAVE TO WHIP DONKEYS</i>
<i>INTO RACEHORSES.</i>

I'VE HAND-PICKED YOU GUYS
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL
ADAPTABLE DUDES

WITH NO ATTITUDES,
JUST GRATITUDE.
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT?

MIKE HUNT, YOU FED ME
MANY TIMES FOR FREE.

NOW I'M GONNA
PAY YOU BACK.

TERRY, YOUR DAD BEING
A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY

IS GONNA PUT US
AT A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

YOU'RE GONNA BE OUR EYES AND
EARS INSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

DUSTIN, YOU'RE THE ONLY JOCK
IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO DIDN'T BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

I APPRECIATE THAT.
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
YOU'VE GOT A BURNT KNEE,

YOU'RE STILL CAPABLE
OF KICKING ASS
AND HAULING GRASS.

DYLAN, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEAT ME
IN PAINTBALL.

I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY BACK
IN CASE THINGS GO DOWN
O.K. CORRAL STYLE, YOU FEEL ME?

FUCKING PATRICK. I MEAN, WE'VE
BEEN FRIENDS SINCE WE WERE,
WHAT? FIVE YEARS OLD?

REMEMBER THAT TIME I
GOT POPPED FOR SHOPLIFTING
AND YOU TOOK THE HEAT?

GOOD MAN.

SCUZZ.

YOU'RE JUST SCUZZ.

SO I HAVE ONE QUESTION,
AND ONE QUESTION ONLY.

CAN I TRUST YOU?

BECAUSE WE HOLD EACH OTHER'S
FUTURES IN OUR HANDS.

UNITED WE STAND,
DIVIDED WE FALL.

AND IF WE FALL, IT'S
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S TALKING
WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LISTENING.

SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA
WHAT THE CONCEPT OF COOL IS.

CLINT EASTWOOD IS COOL. TWELVE
TO TWENTY WORDS A PICTURE,

DOESN'T NEED TO BRAG,
DOESN'T NEED TO BOAST,
JUST GETS SHIT DONE.

HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING PAID?
RUNNERS GET PAID 3500 A RUN
AND DRIVERS GET 1500 A RUN.

HOW MUCH ARE YOU GETTING PAID?
ENOUGH TO PAY YOU 3500 A RUN.

I'M PUTTING EVERYTHING I HAVE,
EVERYONE I LOVE
OUT ON A SKINNY LIMB.

SO, IF IT WORKS OUT, YEAH,
I MAY TAKE HOME SOME MONEY.

YOU'RE GONNA BE PART
OF THE "A" TEAM, I NEED YOU

IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF YOUR LIFE.

THAT MEANS WE TRAIN
AND WE TRAIN AND THEN
WE TRAIN SOME MORE.

PAIN IS JUST WEAKNESS
LEAVING YOUR BODY.

YOU WANT TO STOP AND TAKE
A BREAK? TAKE A LONG ONE
AND DON'T COME BACK.

WE CAN'T BE IN THE FOREST.
WE NEED TO BECOME THE FOREST.

WE NEED TO BE PREPARED
FOR ANY AND EVERY EVENTUALITY.

WE'RE GONNA RIG SCUZZ'S CAR
WITH GAS CANS TO EXPLODE

IF WE GET PULLED OVER
BY THE COPS.

WHOA!
OH, FUCK OFF.

WHAT THE FUCK? WHY MY CAR?

BECAUSE IT'S READY
TO BLOW ANYWAY.

AND BECAUSE I SAID SO.
FUCKING CHILL.
YOU SOUND LIKE MY DAD.

HE MIGHT BE. I MEAN, THE WAY
YOUR MOM SUCKS AND FUCKS
AROUND TOWN--

FUCK YOU.

WE'RE USING TWO CARS,
ONE DECOY AND ONE LOAD CAR.

MAKE SURE ALL THE CARS
ARE CLEAN. INSURANCE,
EVEN TIRE PRESSURE.

AND WE NEVER HAVE THE CRISP
FOR THE PRODUCT

IN THE SAME CAR
WITH THE RUNNERS.

IF WE GET TAILED,
THE REAR DECOY

WILL ATTACK AND DISTRACT
AND WE WILL KEEP ON ROLLING.

REMEMBER THE DETAILS.

PLAN THE RUN AND RUN THE PLAN.

CELL PHONES OFF.

IF YOUR PHONE'S ON,
THE FEDS CAN TRACE YOU
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.

WE MAINTAIN
ABSOLUTE SILENCE.

IF WE TRIP OFF THE MOTION
SENSORS, THEY'LL BE LISTENING TO
US WITH HIDDEN MIKES.

YOU CLOSE EVERY GATE
YOU OPEN, YOU PACK OUT
WHAT YOU PACK IN.

DON'T EVEN SPIT
UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.

SERIOUSLY, THE LAST THING
WE WANT TO DO IS PISS OFF

ONE OF THESE SURVIVALIST
REDNECK TYPES LIVING
IN THESE WOODS.

IT'LL BE 16.3 MILES
ACROSS THE TRAIL.

SUPPLIER WILL MEET US
AT THE DESIGNATED TRANSFER SPOT

AND WE SWAP CASH FOR STASH.

LOAD UP.

HOLD THE BAG.
HOLD THE FUCKING BAG.

YOU'LL BE CARRYING
60 POUNDS EACH.

I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH
IS GOING IN,

I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH
IS COMING OUT.

SO NO LOOSE PILLOWS,
NO SCRAPED BUTTS,
NO SAMPLES, NOTHING.

WE GOT A JOB TO DO
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

THEY'LL BE WATCHING
FROM THE AIR.

SO WHEN WE HEAD BACK,

WE NEED TO BE NINJAS.
DELTA FORCE STRIKE TEAM SHIT.

SERIOUSLY, INVISIBLE,
LIKE BABY'S BREATH.

ONCE WE MAKE IT ACROSS
THE AMERICAN SIDE,

IT'S A FLAT-OUT SPRINT
TO THE FINISH LINE.

IF WE TRIP OFF ANY SENSORS,
THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR US.

WE BETTER BE IN OUR CAR
AND ON OUR WAY OUT

BEFORE THEY EVEN WIPE
THE DOUGHNUT SUGAR
OFF THEIR MOUTHS. GOT ME?

YOU GOT ME OR WHAT?

YEAH.

LET'S FUCKING DO THIS.

ALL RIGHT, HOLD UP.

HOLD UP.
WHAT?

WE'RE TAKING A BREAK.

NO. NO NO NO.
NO SAMPLING.

FUCK YOU, NATE. TAKE IT
OUT OF MY PAYCHECK.
I WILL.

NOW IT'S OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK,
MOTHERFUCKER.

[GUYS LAUGH]

<i>THOSE FIRST FEW RUNS</i>
<i>WENT LIKE CLOCKWORK.</i>

<i>WE WERE CANNABIS CAMELS,</i>
<i>TEAM TRIPLE "B,"</i>

<i>HUMMING ALONG LIKE</i>
<i>A PERFECTLY OILED MACHINE.</i>

<i>WE COULD FINALLY AFFORD</i>
<i>UNLIMITED WINGS</i>
<i>AND PREMIUM BEER.</i>

GUYS, JOB WELL DONE, EH?

YES.
YES.

MANY MORE TO COME.
FUCK, YEAH.

AND ANOTHER THING.

I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

THESE WINGS ARE PRETTY--

â™ª HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME

THIS IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING, GUYS.

BAM.

JESUS, GUYS, DON'T
OPEN IT HERE.

DON'T I GET MORE
THAN THE OTHER DRIVER?

WHY?

BECAUSE I CARRIED THE PRODUCT.
I TOOK ALL THE RISK.

WE'LL SWITCH IT UP NEXT TIME.
YEAH, BUT I NEED IT THIS TIME.

OKAY, YEAH? AND?
FUCK YOU, NATE.

GUYS, PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING AT US.

DON'T FUCKING TELL ME
TO CHILL.

RELAX, SCUZZ.
HEY, ARE YOU TOPHER?

WHAT?
I HEAR YOU'RE PAYING 3500

TO HAUL GREAT GREEN
ACROSS THE BORDER.
I'D LOVE TO GET HOOKED UP.

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT, KID?

WHO'S TALKING TO YOU,
DICK MONKEY? LOOK, MAN,
I'LL DO IT FOR TWO G'S,

AND I PROMISE I CAN
RUN MORE POUNDS THAN
THIS FUCKING TELETUBBY.

FUCKING BEAT IT, KID.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW, KID.

FUCKING FOUR-EYED FAT FUCK.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

YOUR LANGUAGE.
SEE HOW FUCKING LONG

YOU CAN PLAY
BEFORE YOU GET POPPED.

GO BACK TO DAYCARE.
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

OKAY, HOW YOU DOING?
WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?

WE DO ONE JOB
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S

FUCKING ALL OVER
THE FRONT PAGES?

WHO'S TALKING?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

NOT ME, MAN.
I DIDN'T SAY SHIT, MAN.

AND WHY THE FUCK DO THEY
THINK YOU'RE RUNNING THE SHOW,
HUH, TOPH?

WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE A LEADER

AND I HAD TO CARRY
YOUR FUCKING ASS THE WHOLE WAY.
OUTSIDE, RIGHT NOW.

NATE.

TOPHER, BE REALLY NICE--
DID THAT KID CALL HIM
A TELETUBBY?


WHAT IS WRONG

THAT'S BULLSHIT.

IT WAS MY IDEA. I HAD

SEVEN RUNS A WEEK,
YOU'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE

IN 16, 17 WEEKS.

YOU SAID FUCKING
MULTI-MILLIONAIRE, NATE.

THEN DOUBLE THAT!
32 OR 34, WHATEVER.

JESUS CHRIST, MAN.
FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

I NEED YOU TO HEAD UP

<i>AND TO MAKE MY MOM'S</i>
<i>WILDEST DREAMS COME TRUE.</i>

<i>BEST FEELING</i>
<i>IN THE WORLD.</i>

<i>OKAY, MAYBE SECOND BEST.</i>

HOW DO YOU KNOW

JUST SOME PEOPLE FROM WORK.

IS THIS ONE OF YOUR
DRUG-DEALER FRIENDS?

SHUT UP, PHILLIP.
PHILLIP.

WOW.
LOOK AT THAT VIEW.

IT'S PRETTY
SPECTACULAR, HUH?

OH, MY GOD.

PRETTY SWEET, HUH?

ANYTHING YOU WANT.

OH, MY GOD.

HOW CAN YOU AFFORD THIS,
SWEETHEART?

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

STOP--
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

AND IT JUST--
IT JUST BLEW UP.

AND NOW THINGS

I'M CASHING IN.

OH, I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU TOO, MOM.
WELCOME HOME.

<i>[NATE]</i>
<i>I DON'T THINK</i>
<i>MY MOM REALLY BOUGHT</i>

<i>THE I.P.O. STORY.</i>
<i>ANY MOM CAN</i>

<i>LOOK IN YOUR EYE</i>
<i>AND SEE THE LIE.</i>

<i>BUT IT TOOK</i>
<i>MY 11-YEAR-OLD BRO</i>

<i>TO POINT OUT</i>
<i>WHAT WAS REALLY UP.</i>

YOU'RE A DRUG DEALER.

DEALING DRUGS.

THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

MM, THESE GUYS
FROM SCHOOL.

I DON'T DO DRUGS.

I HATE DRUGS.

REALLY.
REALLY.

YOU DON'T DO DRUGS,
DO YOU, KID?

NO, I HATE 'EM.
GOOD.

KEEP IT THAT WAY, HUH?

<i>[NATE]</i>
<i>BUT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,</i>

<i>AS LONG AS THEY WERE</i>
<i>PROFITING IN A FAT WAY,</i>

<i>NO ONE WANTED TO KNOW</i>
<i>WHERE THE BAGS OF CASH</i>

<i>WERE REALLY COMING FROM.</i>

<i>THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WERE</i>
<i>A GREEN AND BUBBLY BLUR.</i>

<i>ALL WE WERE DOING WAS</i>
<i>RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS,</i>

<i>AND WE WERE CLEARING</i>
<i>A MILLION A WEEK.</i>

<i>AND TOPHER WAS STILL</i>
<i>SAMPLING THE BUDS</i>

<i>EVERY TIME HE WENT OVER</i>
<i>FOR A PICKUP.</i>

<i>THE GREFARDS WERE SUPPLYING</i>

<i>THE HIGHEST-QUALITY PRODUCT</i>

<i>ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN.</i>

<i>WE HAD AN APARTMENT</i>
<i>IN SPOKANE THAT WE USED</i>

<i>FOR THE DROPOFFS.</i>

<i>AT FIRST</i>
<i>IT WAS ONCE A WEEK.</i>

<i>THEN THREE TIMES A WEEK.</i>

<i>THEN EVERY DAY</i>
<i>OF THE WEEK.</i>

<i>AND ALL OF OUR LIFESTYLES</i>
<i>WERE TAKING A SERIOUS UPGRADE.</i>

<i>I FINALLY GOT</i>
<i>A LEGIT EYE EXAM.</i>

<i>WITH THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION,</i>
<i>THE WORLD WAS STARTING TO LOOK</i>

<i>A WHOLE LOT BETTER.</i>

<i>I'M NOT SAYING WHERE.</i>

<i>BUT I PUT A NICE CHUNK</i>
<i>OF MY PROFIT AWAY</i>

<i>FOR A RAINY DAY.</i>

<i>MY OWN LITTLE 401(K).</i>

<i>TOPHER AND I EVEN</i>
<i>JOINED A GYM.</i>

<i>GOT MYSELF A HOT TRAINER</i>
<i>AND WAS WELL ON MY WAY</i>

<i>TO LOSING 50 POUNDS</i>
<i>OF PEPPERONI PIZZA BABY FAT.</i>

<i>EVERYONE WAS HAPPY.</i>

<i>PRICES WERE GOING DOWN.</i>

<i>AND QUALITY UP.</i>

<i>EVERYONE WANTED</i>
<i>A PIECE OF THE PIE.</i>

<i>WE HAD THE BEST-LOOKING</i>
<i>GIRLS IN TOWN IN PAIRS.</i>

<i>GIRLS THAT WOULDN'T'VE</i>
<i>LOOKED IN OUR DIRECTION</i>

<i>NOW WERE SUCKING ON</i>
<i>THE BIG BONG.</i>

<i>WE WERE WORKING HARD</i>
<i>AND PLAYING EVEN HARDER.</i>

<i>AND HAD FORGOTTEN</i>
<i>OLD MAN GREFARD'S ADVICE</i>

<i>ABOUT NOT FLASHING</i>
<i>YOUR HUBRIS</i>

<i>AND CANDY APPLES,</i>
<i>WHATEVER.</i>

<i>MY HEAD WAS</i>
<i>SO FAR UP MY ASS,</i>

<i>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</i>
<i>COULDN'T'VE FOUND IT.</i>

<i>BUT THEN ONE NIGHT,</i>
<i>WE GOT A BIG WAKE-UP CALL.</i>

WHAT IS IT?

DID YOU HEAR THAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMETHING.

FUCKING HEAR ANYTHING--

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

OKAY, DO IT.

SCUZZ! PUT OUT
THE FUCKING CIGARETTE NOW!

THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

SCUZZ, PUT IT OUT!

COME ON, COME ON.

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

WHOA.

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

SAME AS YOU, BRO.

OH YEAH?

YEAH, THAT'S YOUR
FIRST MISTAKE.

I GOT THE FRANCHISE FOR
THIS PART OF THE WORLD,

YOU UNDERSTAND?

GIVE ME THE BAG.

GIVE ME THE FUCKING BAG BEFORE
I BUST A CAP IN YOUR ASS!

OKAY. OKAY.

OKAY.
I'M GIVING YOU THE BAG.

RELAX, BRO, RELAX--

GO GO GO! GO GO GO!


FUCK!

FUCKIN' ASIAN ASS-FUCK BUTLER.

I'D RECOGNIZE THAT
HALF-FAG VOICE ANYWHERE.

THOUGHT OUR TICKETS
WERE PUNCHED.

I WAS SCARED SPITLESS.

IF I WAS SMART,
I WOULD'VE GAVE HIM THE WEED

AND MAKE YOU DEAL WITH
THE FUCKIN' ASIAN FIGHT CLUB.

YOU DO THAT,
BUTLER WOULD'VE
TAKEN THE WEED

AND KILLED EVERYONE.
CASE CLOSED.

ALL THESE GUYS
DESERVE TRIPLE THE MONEY
ON THE NEXT RUN.

FUCK YEAH! FUCK YEAH!
HAZARD PAY!

WE GOT FUCKIN' SHOT AT.

FUCK MAN,
WE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

BUT YOU WEREN'T,

COMIN' FROM
THE CALI SALAD BOWL.

WE TORE

PAST THE DRYWALL,
DOWN TO THE SLAB--

YOU DON'T LOOK FOR

ONE FUCKING TIME.
OH, YOU'RE TELLING US

HOW TO DO IT NOW?

YEAH.

I'M TELLING YOU
HOW TO DO IT.

YEAH, YOU...

YOU ASK HIM
WHERE THE MONEY IS ONE TIME.

AND IF HE DOESN'T
FUCKING TALK,

TAKE HIS GIRLFRIEND

AND KNOCK HER FRONT TEETH OUT,
AND YOU GAG HER WITH COCK.

TELL HER

HE'LL SHOW YOU WHERE
THE MONEY IS REAL FAST.

LOOK, I WANT

THIS DONE NOW.

HOW ABOUT THAT? HUH?
I'LL PIN IT TO YOUR BLOUSE.

I'LL SHARPEN THE KNIFE,
HIRE YOU A COUNSELOR

SO YOU TWO

I MEAN, I COULD'VE
BROKEN OUT OF THOSE HANDCUFFS

ON MY OWN.

WHAT'D YOU TELL 'EM,
SUPER-SCUZZ?

I TELL THEM,
"FUCK ALL, MAN."

SO YOU DIDN'T SHOW THEM
WHERE YOU THOUGHT I LIVED?

FUCK YOU, NATE. THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU ARE STILL ALIVE

IS BECAUSE I TOOK A BEATING,

PISSED YOUR FUCKING DRESS.

AAH! FUCK!

WHAT THE FUCK!

MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
I AM MINDING
MY OWN FUCKING BUSINESS--

THIS IS ALL
OF OUR BUSINESS!

I'M IN CHARGE.

DID YOU PAY
TO HAVE HIM WHACKED?

HUH?

I RUN THINGS
FOR A REASON.

YOU DON'T NEED
TO KNOW THE DETAILS.

NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
GO SIT DOWN,

WATCH SOME T.V., HUH?

GO. SIT DOWN.

ANYBODY WANT
SOME COKE?

YEAH.
YEAH.

GET OVER HERE.



WE POPPED YOU WITH 12 POUNDS
OF MARIJUANA.

BAGGED FOR DISTRIBUTION.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY IS?

YEAH, I THINK--
YEAH. IT'S WHEN
TWO OR MORE PEOPLE

GET TOGETHER
TO COMMIT A CRIME.

[PAPERS RUSTLING]

RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THIS.

"CONSPIRACY
TO DISTRIBUTE MARIJUANA."

THERE IS A MANDATORY MINIMUM,

25 YEARS
IN A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.

25 YEARS?
THAT'S FUCKED UP.

I-I WAS JUST DRIVING--
RIPPING OFF
YOUR DOPER BUDDIES--

NO!
YEAH.

WE HAD PEOPLE FOLLOWING YOU
PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

YOU WEREN'T GONE LONG ENOUGH
TO GET INTO CANADA,

SO YOU WENT BACK THERE
TO GET WHAT YOU'D STOLEN

AND HIDDEN FROM YOUR BUDDIES
ON THE LAST RUN.

HMM?

ARE YOU GONNA
TELL MY MOM?

WE'VE ALREADY CONFISCATED
HER MINIVAN.

I'M SURE SHE'LL FIND OUT
BEFORE THE MORNING PAPERS.

SHE'S GONNA KICK MY ASS--
SHE'S NOT GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS, DANIEL.

SHE'S GONNA BE HAPPY...

BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HELP US
FIND THOSE GUYS

THAT GOT YOU INTO THIS MESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

[PHONE RINGING FAINTLY]

â™ª [OMINOUS MUSIC]

[DOOR SQUEAKS]

[FOOTSTEPS THUMPING]

WHAT THE FUCK?

TIME TO GET UP, NATE.

HOW DID YOU GET--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

I HAVE FRIENDS
WHO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

AND THERE'S A REALLY BAD DAY
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT,

LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO HAPPEN.

WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

GO.

SPEND SOME TIME
WITH MY FRIENDS UP NORTH.

NOW?
I LIKE YOU, NATE.

YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
STRAIGHT UP WITH ME,

AND IN OUR BUSINESS,

THAT IS RARE.

I AM TRYING
TO HELP YOU LIVE...

ANOTHER DAY.

COME ON! COME ON!
WE'RE HERE. GO, GO, GO!

COME ON!
GO, GO, GO, GO.

FUCK! COME ON!
HURRY UP, GO!

GO, GO!
GET IN.

WHAT THE FUCK--

COME ON, GO!

GO, GO, GO!

[SIREN BLARING]
GO! COPS!
WHAT THE FUCK? GO!

FUCK!
WHERE'D THEY ALL COME FROM?

[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]
FUCKING--

GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE!

GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

WE GOT A RUNNER!
WE GOT A RUNNER!

HANDS WHERE
I CAN SEE THEM!

HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!
[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]

[HEAVY BREATHING]

GET DOWN!


DON'T MOVE.

GOT HIM.
FUCK YOU, COPS!

YOU SMUGGLED OVER 18 TONS
OF MARIJUANA

ACROSS AN INTERNATIONAL
BORDER,

AT A VALUE OF OVER
$68 MILLION.

YOU'RE FACING
LIFE SENTENCES

WITH NO POSSIBILITY
OF PAROLE.

TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT MY TITS, BOYS.

'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE,

THEY'RE THE LAST PAIR
YOU'RE EVER GOING TO SEE.

I ONLY HAVE A FEW
"GET OUT OF JAIL EARLY" CARDS.

SO FIRST COME,
FIRST SERVED.

I WANT TO KNOW
WHO THE GUY WAS
AT THE TOP.

WHO PULLED THE STRINGS.

WHO RAN THE SHOW.


NATE NORMAN.

YEAH, IT WAS FUCKIN' NATE.
NATE NORMAN.

NATE GAVE
ALL THE ORDERS.

AND WE JUST WENT
WHERE HE TOLD US TO GO.

NATE NEVER TOLD US
WHAT WAS IN THE BAGS.

WE HAD NO IDEA.

NATE HAD ALL
OF THE CONNECTIONS.

NATE KEPT
ALL THE MONEY.

NATE SUPPLIED
THE FINANCING.

WE DIDN'T SEE SHIT.

NATE TOLD ME IF I LEFT,
HE'D KILL MY FAMILY.

NATE HAD
BRENDAN BUTLER KILLED.

I'M PRETTY SURE
HE DID.

THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

I'M PRETTY SURE.

NATE HAD
BRENDAN BUTLER KILLED.

THAT'S A FACT.

HE WAS BRAGGING
ABOUT IT.

NATE NORMAN.

IT WAS NATE'S IDEA.

HE RAN THE SHOW.

[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]

GO, GO, GO!

<i>"GONE TO ECUADOR</i>
<i>FOR A FEW MONTHS</i>

<i>"TO GO HIKING.</i>

<i>"HAVE A BOWL OF BC BUD</i>
<i>ON ME.</i>

<i>SEE YA SOON, NATE."</i>

LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!
GET YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD!

RIGHT NOW!
HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD!

WHERE'S NATE?
NATE NORMAN?

I DON'T KNOW!

<i>WHILE I WAS HIDING</i>
<i>UP IN CANADA,</i>

<i>MOVING ALONG</i>
<i>THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY,</i>

<i>THE FEDS WERE DOING</i>
<i>EVERY SLEAZY THING THEY COULD</i>

<i>TO TRY TO GET ME BACK</i>
<i>IN THEIR JURISDICTION.</i>

[AIR HORN BLOWS]

THAT'S WHAT
THE LAWYER SAYS, MOM.

YOU COULD DO TEN YEARS
FOR MONEY LAUNDERING

IF I DON'T TURN
MYSELF IN.

STICK IT TO PHILLIP
IF THEY CAN'T GET TO ME.

YOU JUST STAY
WHERE YOU ARE, BABY.

THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO SQUEEZE US TO GET TO YOU.

[NATE ON PHONE]
I JUST...
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU GUYS

TO GET INTO ANY MORE TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF ME.

BABY, THEY WANT
TO PUT YOU IN JAIL

FOR THE REST
OF YOUR GOD-GIVEN LIFE.

THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT A GOOD BOY YOU ARE.

THAT-- THAT YOU SHOVELED
MRS. ROLAND'S DRIVEWAY

EVERY TIME THE SNOW PLOW
BLOCKED IT IN,

AND YOU NEVER ONCE ASKED HER
FOR A WOODEN NICKEL.

YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

OKAY?

LOVE YOU, MOM.

[NATE ON PHONE]
I'M SORRY.

DON'T BE SORRY, HONEY.

IT'S JUST POT.

IT'S JUST POT.

[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]

WELCOME BACK,
MR. NORMAN.

THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
WAITING FOR YOU.

<i>I COULD HAVE STAYED UP</i>
<i>IN CANADA</i>

<i>AND HAD A SEMI-SWEET LIFE,</i>

<i>BUT I COULDN'T RISK MOM</i>
<i>DOING ONE DAY IN THE BIG HOUSE.</i>

<i>I THOUGHT I WOULD MISS</i>
<i>THE CARS,</i>

<i>THE HOUSES,</i>
<i>THE GIRLS,</i>

<i>BUT I REALIZED</i>
<i>IT WAS NEVER REALLY</i>
<i>ABOUT THE MONEY.</i>

<i>IT WAS ABOUT</i>
<i>THE THRILL OF THE CHASE.</i>

GOOD EVENING,
MR. NORMAN.

THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK.

LEAVE THE KEY
IN THE IGNITION.

YOU WON'T BE NEEDING
THOSE ANYMORE.

<i>HEY, I'M NOT SAYING</i>
<i>IT WASN'T NICE SWOOPING DOWN</i>

<i>AND SLIPPING TEN GRAND</i>
<i>IN YOUR BEST FRIEND'S POCKET,</i>

<i>FOR A HARD DAY'S WORK,</i>
<i>HAULING HEMP.</i>
<i>JIM.</i>

<i>AND GUY,</i>
<i>WHOSE ONLY OTHER OPTION</i>

<i>WAS A NAMETAG</i>
<i>AND $4.25 AN HOUR.</i>

<i>BUT GRATITUDE AND LOYALTY</i>

<i>ARE THE FIRST THINGS</i>
<i>TO RUN FOR COVER</i>

<i>WHEN YOU'RE FACING</i>
<i>TEN YEARS,</i>

<i>BUSTING ROCKS</i>
<i>AND DODGING COCKS.</i>

<i>YOU KNOW,</i>
<i>FOR THE RECORD,</i>

<i>I WOULD'VE GIVEN UP</i>
<i>A KIDNEY FOR TOPHER.</i>

<i>SO WHEN I GOT ROLLED ON</i>
<i>AND SOLD ON,</i>

<i>I REALLY HURT RIGHT DOWN</i>
<i>TO THE MARROW.</i>

<i>BUT HE HAS TO LIVE</i>
<i>WITH WHAT HE DID.</i>

<i>KARMA'S A BITCH.</i>
<i>[SEATBELT CLICKS]</i>

<i>I GOT ANOTHER DIME TO DO</i>

<i>AT THE "I FUCKED UP BIG TIME"</i>
<i>FRAT HOUSE,</i>

<i>BUT I'VE GOT</i>
<i>A SOLID CELL-IATE,</i>

<i>WHO'S GOT A GREAT IDEA</i>
<i>FOR A MONEY-MAKING VENTURE</i>

<i>THAT'S GUARANTEED TO--</i>
<i>[SIGHS]</i>

<i>I SHOULD PROBABLY</i>
<i>JUST KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.</i>

<i>BUT YOU'LL LEARN A LOT</i>
<i>IN PRISON,</i>

<i>IF YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN</i>
<i>AND YOUR EARS OPEN.</i>

<i>I'M NOT SAYING</i>
<i>IT'S THE GREATEST THING</i>

<i>THAT'S EVER HAPPENED</i>
<i>TO ME,</i>

<i>BUT I'M MAKING</i>
<i>THE BEST OF IT.</i>

<i>THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.</i>
