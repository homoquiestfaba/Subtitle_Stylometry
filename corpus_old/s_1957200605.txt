Piss bitch!




Go!

Berty!

The one on the right, asshole.

(rock music)

[Jen] Yeah, I don't know
if I'm doing this right.

Should there be a
light on or something?

[Boggs] So, you
put it on there?

Right by the skiing place.

[Boggs] Dude, we
should put the logo

on the Rockwood, dude.


Wait, hold on a second.

Do that again.

Right there.

[Lisa] Everett Road.

I think we turn left.

Give me it.

(paper rustling)

No, we go straight through.

Hang on, this is Riverview.

Ezra said to hang a Lester.

Yeah, well, Ezra's a fag.

[Boggs] We're going straight.

Man, I should take
a dump off a there.

We're okay.

It should be right up here.

[Boggs] Man, soon
as MTV hears this,

we're just going to get all

Oh, we're getting warmer.




(rock music)

Oh, man.

[Lisa] Derek, come on. Stop...

[Boggs] Shut up, Lis.


Oh dude, wait, wait.

Turn up here.

[Robert] Here?

[Boggs] Yeah.

(grass crunching)

[Jen] Hurry up.

[Boggs] Oh, miss me already?

Be right back.

(keys jingling)


[Boggs] We're in the boonies,

just stop being a pussy.


Oh, that is nasty.

[Robert] Oh, man.

(flies buzzing)
(grass crunching)

Dude, looks like your
mom's gnarled bush.

[Robert] Eat me, dude.


Hold on.

(rock music in background)

Hear that?

[Boggs] What?

(rock music in background)

â™ª It's not fair you leave me

â™ª And watch you go

â™ª Can we go back now

(sex sounds in distance)

Okay, yeah.



(Van beeps)

(Kids in van screaming)

[Woman Having Sex] Oh, my God!


[Boggs] Give it to her good,
you old fucker! (laughing)


[Man Having Sex]
Mother fucker!


(engine starting)



Did you guys
ever do that thing

in Dolan's class about
your personality?

Okay, if you could be a bear,

a monkey, or a rabbit,

which one would you be?

What about you?

Bear.

I guess I'd be a monkey.

[Boggs] No, no.

A hawk.

Yeah, I'll be a hawk.


Oh, my God.

Is your nose bleeding?

I don't know, I guess.


[Jen] Here.

Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, Lise.

Are you okay?

Shit Robert, pull over.

Oh, my God.

[Boggs] Fucking pull over.


(footsteps pattering)

[Boggs] Hey, you okay, Lise?


(mumbling in background)


I have a headache.


(engine rumbling)

[Boggs] Hippies.

[Jen] Shouldn't
you not be allowed...

[Boggs] Good lord.

[Robert] I can smell
'em from here. (laughing)

[Boggs] Oh.

Oh, man.

Oh, fuck.

[Jen] You could braid it.

[Boggs] Whoa, whoa, whoa.


'Cause he's a whole fucking
lot better (laughing).

[Jen] Well, he's not as bad.

[Lisa] That's your
boyfriend, you want him.


[Boggs] He's like a little
scrawny bear (laughing).

Oh.

[Jen] Ew, look at her armpits.

They like little squirrels.

[Lisa] You could braid that.

[Boggs] Oh.

(rock music)

That's it.


(grass crunching)
(crickets chirping)

Give a hoot.

Don't pollute.


(grass crunching)

Oh, man.

What?

Holy shit.

[Robert] See?

Told you.

[Jen] Wow.

Well, I take back
what I said about Ezra.

[Robert] That's money.

Shit, we got a fucking
garden salad here.

[Jen] Party
tonight (laughing).


[Robert] You got a bag?

[Boggs] Where
did it come from?

[Robert] You got a bag, dude?

(grass crunching)


Who is that?


Guys...

(grass crunching)

[Robert] He saw us, dude.

[Jen] What is he doing?

What are we dong?

[Boggs] Shut up.

[Lisa] Derek,
what are we doing?

[Boggs] Settle down, Beavis.


Berty, keep filming.

Everybody just play along.

(grass crunching)

How you doing, man?

[Boggs] Hey.

Hello.

Hi.

Whew (laughing).

We're just hanging out.

You looking for something?

Yeah, Lisa lost her dog.


It's a little Shih Tzu,

a little moppy looking thing.

You seen him around, though?

No.

Mrs. Conger just wanted to know

what you kids were
doing out here.

Just hanging out.

She doesn't like folks
on her property, and uh...

I told her I'd come out and see.

So, everything's okay, then?

Yeah.

Yep.

Good lucking finding your pup.

Lisa...

Yeah?

That is the prettiest.

Elizabeth.

[Robert] Have a good one, man.

When you find your puppy,

you best be on your way, okay?

(dog barking)

No problem.

(grass crunching)


Pooo!

Here, Poody!



[Boggs] Freak show.

Bert. You get all that?

[Berty] Yeah.

[Boggs] Sweet.

(dog barking in background)
(wind chimes)


[Robert] Let's go, dude.

[Jen] Get the fuck over here.

(birds chirping)

[Robert] Quit fartin'
around over there.

[Jen] Come on,
we're fuckin' leaving.

(rock music)

[Boggs] (mumbling)
every once in awhile.



(engine rumbling)

Hold on, I'll get you up.

All right, right
foot, left foot.

Damn it.

Did you put grease on
these fucking trees?

We will defeat you!


Oh, God.




Double dog, fuck,

that's a single dog, dick head.

I'll do it.




(wheels spinning)

[Robert] 'Bout time.

[Jen] Shut up.

(door opening)

(footsteps pattering)

Nice of your sister
to let you use her bike.


(engines rumbling)

[Man In White Shirt]
Oh yeah that's way big.

(engine revving)

This fucking sucks.

Can we go?

(engine revving)

[Boggs] Chello!

Hey!

[Jen] God it's your boyfriend.

Hey, Chello!

What's up, man?

Hey, Chello.

What's up, man?

Hey, Salty.


Like it?

[Boggs] Hell yeah.

Hop in, man.

[Boggs] Oh, yeah, yeah.
It was a whole bunch of it.

We were just there.

We're going back tonight.

Who told you about it?

[Boggs] Remember Ezra?

Ezra?

Ezra the fag?


I don't see a light.

[Boggs] Oh yeah,
I put tape over it.

[Cello] Is that Missy
Naughton's little sister?

[Boggs] Yep.

[Chello] Is that your woman?

[Boggs] Yeah.

[Chello] Damn.


(lighter flicking)

(rock music)

You still play drums, Salty?

[Boggs] Uh yeah,
I'm in a band.

(rock music)

Cool.

[Boggs] Yeah, we're
gonna start playing out

pretty soon, too.

Well, if you need some
help getting rid of it, man,

just let me know.

I'll hook you up.

(engines revving)

[Boggs] Yeah, cool.

Thanks, man.

By Virginia Kendall

[Boggs] Yeah, I guess.

Boston, I think?

Boston Town?

Oh, Boston Mills.

(thunder rumbles)

Careful, dude.

[Boggs] You been there?

Eh, not for a couple years

but everybody's been there.

Million of stories
about Hell Town.

[Boggs] What's that mean?

Well, you aren't
gonna find it on any map

but that's what
everyone calls it.

Don't be caught in
the forest alone.

The trees and rocks
breathe on their own.

Spirits and murder,

the one-eyed hearse.

Boston Mills is a
town with a curse.


[Boggs] You
making this shit up?

(thunder crackling)

House in the woods,

a giggling ghost.

Survive the night to your
friends you will boast.

And if you see
Hattie's glowing gown,

you'll die alone in Hell Town.

Hell town.

Something like that.

I fucked it up.

[Boggs] Shit.

Yeah, your brother, man.

Me and him used to
go down in the woods

and scare the shit
out of all the chicks.

Drop 'em off in the woods

and show them the
haunted school bus

and tell them the story
about Hammer Hattie.

[Boggs] Who's that?

Hattie Fichtner.

Crazy ole bitch.

Story back in the
70's or something.

(thunder crackling)

And she used to hang all her
kids toys from the trees.

Hoping they'd come home.

Crazy bitch didn't even
know she killed 'em herself.

Crushed their
skulls with hammers.

Just punishment, or something.
Shit.

Oh, fuck.

Yeah.

Supposedly, it's
cursed ever since, man.

Like Rogue's Hollow,
Gore's Orphanage,

all that shit.

And make sure you take 'em up

and show 'em that church will
all those upside down crosses.

[Boggs] So, what
about the school bus?

Eh...

There's a whole bunch
of different versions

of that story

but basically,

there's a bus load of
kids out in the woods.

They get lured off the bus

and someone, or something,

murders 'em one at a time.

It was in the papers,

a whole bunch of stuff about it,

and I guess if you're
out there real late now,

you can still hear 'em crying.

[Boggs] Uh yeah, kinda.

She was that girl
that ran away, right?

Yeah.

You probably wouldn't
remember all the way

but they

found some of her
hair down there.

Don't get caught fucking around.

Cops are dicks.


[Boggs] Is this bullshit?

No, man.

There's this ghost
in the cemetery.

Can't find her grave,

wondering around all the time.

Yeah, you can look all this
shit up. It's all Hell Town.

Hell Town, Ohio.

hauntedohio.com.

You can see all this stuff.

And we used to go to crazy
house out in the woods.

Some people say it
was a funeral home.

It's on me, chief.

[Boggs] Ah, thanks, dude.

Yeah, you don't know
where you got it, though.

[Boggs] Oh yeah,
don't know shit.

Hey, have Tommy give
me a call, all right?

[Boggs] Yeah.

Yeah, I will.

All right.

Later, Salty
(thunder crackling).

(crickets chirping)

Our mom's such a
bitch, dude (laughing).

Dude, Lisa, the other day, okay,

she comes home from school all
teared out (crying noises),

she got a B in history.

A fucking B.

God.

If I got a B in anything,

my mom would be doing nude
back flips in the front lawn.

I think she's in the kitchen.

You go get that one.

(crickets chirping)


(footsteps pattering)

One, two, three.


Mom!


(door shutting)

(footsteps pattering)

She locked us out.

Come on (knocking).

(engine rumbling)

[Boggs] Dude,
it's not over here.

[Lisa] What are
you looking for?

[Boggs] Nothing.

Which road did we turn on?

[Robert] Can't remember.

(crickets chirping)

[Lisa] I can't see anything.

[Boggs] Turn on
the night vision.

[Lisa] How do I do that?

[Boggs] Here, give it to me.

There.

Is it green?

[Lisa] Yeah.

Ew.

You look creepy.

[Berty] Hello?

(crickets chirping)

[Lisa] Don't
wander off, you guys.

This is how it always starts.



You scared the shit
out of me. (laughing)

[Robert] I was like,
what a dick. (laughing)

[Lisa] I hate you.

Oh, my God.

[Robert] I think we go left.

[Boggs] I'm pretty
sure it's right.

Wasn't there...

[Lisa] Derek, it was left.

[Boggs] No, there
was a building over
there, wasn't there?

[Lisa] No, it was left.

[Boggs] Fine, left.

Fucking don't care if
we're here all night.

(grass crunching)


(squeaking wheel sound)

[Lisa] Hey guys,
wait up a little.

[Robert] It's
off to the right,

when we were going
down here, right?

[Berty] Did we pass it?

I don't think so.

I can't remember.

[Boggs] No, it was the left.

[Robert] There were two lefts?

No, that would've taken
us back towards the car.

[Lisa] I don't know.

I have no idea.

(grass crunching)

I mean, we marked it
real clear, didn't we?

[Robert] Yeah, we'd
see it if we passed it.

I hear something.

Do you hear it?


[Jen] What is that?

[Robert] You have
the bag with you, man?

Yeah, I've got it here but...

[Robert] Just checking.

[Lisa] You guys
don't see anything yet?

Okay, it's one of these.

There's a little path up there

and there's one over here.

[Lisa] Hey guys, wait.

[Berty] Let's go.

[Boggs] What?

[Lisa] You guys, wait.

[Boggs And Derek] What?

[Lisa] Oh my God,
is that a person?

That would be a tree, Lise.

[Lisa] No, you guys.

You guys, there's somebody here.

[Boggs] No, there's not, Lisa.

[Lisa] Yes.

You guys.

Lisa, stop fucking around.

[Lisa] You guys, wait up.

You guys, wait.

[Boggs And Robert] What?

[Boggs] We're looking right
at the same place you are.

[Lisa] You guys, we gotta go.

You guys, wait up!


You guys!

[Boggs] Lisa,
stop freaking out!

[Lisa] You guys, wait!


[Boggs] Watch
out for the tree!

[Lisa] Wait!


[Boggs] Lisa!

What...



Settle down!

[Lisa] You guys, wait!



(camera drop thud)


(birds chirping)

[Boggs] Well, it's
working fine now.

What?

[Boggs] Get up and
walk or something.

Why?

[Boggs] Just get up and walk.

(dog barking)

[Boggs] Piece of poop.

What's wrong with it?


[Boggs] Awuga!



You think you can
handle that, sweetheart?


Punk kids!

Don't mess with the U.S. mail!



[Robert] The internet.

That chick, with snot
hanging out of her nose,

and shit.

Yeah?

I was just talking to Tanya.

She said those kids
are still missing.

(paper rustling)

You can be in our video.

[Jen] I don't think so.

Yeah, in a tube top.

So, what are
you reading there?

(papers rustling)

[Jen] Jesus.






Ow!


[Boggs] Ow, fuck!

[Robert] Kids.

How can you stand him?

[Boggs] There's no
place you can put that

where you know I
won't go after it.

Two, one, fire at will!

(eggs smashing)

There it is.

[Lisa] I'm out of eggs.


[Boggs] Hey, so you guys
wanna hear something? His Mom...

Hey, guess what.

They were playing
"Candy Man" in there.

[Boggs] Oh, I'm sorry.

What, were you talking?

Hi, how are you?

[Boggs] So, his mom offered

to buy him brand spanking
new 1999 Ford Mustang GT.

[Jen] Wow, Robert.

That's pretty cool.

[Boggs] For free, too.

Doesn't have to do shit.

Said he didn't want it.

Why?

[Boggs] He's a
dicklick. I don't know,

he's keeping that piece of shit.

Guys, look.

[Boggs] Hey maybe we
should give your mom a ride.



[Boggs] Shut up, woman.

[Jen] Don't tell
me to shut up.

So, what is a...what was it?

Hosto?

[Jen] It's a hostel, dumb ass.

What the fuck's that?

[Jen] It's like a cheap
hotel boarding house

where travelers stay.

[Robert] Yeah,
I've stayed in one.

[Jen] They're everywhere.

[Lisa] When did
you stay in one?

[Robert] Oh, Canada.

Thought you knew that.
You didn't know that?

When the fuck
were you in Canada?

Mother fucker!

What's up, member
us, mother fuckers!...

[Boggs] What did we do?

You remember us, huh?

Gimme that camera!


[Boggs] Start the damn car!

Fuck you, man!

[Robert] Where
did they come from?

Holy shit.

What the fuck was their problem?


(rock music)

[Robert] Dick.

[Jen] Ew, what is that?

[Lisa] It's a statue.

[Bogggs] It's not a
statue, it's a dude.

(church bell ringing)


(car door opening)

[Lisa] Oh.

Dude, there was a kick
ass lookin' building

behind that church up there.

I can't really see
what's inside of it

but it looks totally sweet.

Come on, Berty.

You and me.

[Berty] No.

Ah dude, come on.

Double dog.

[Berty] Take Robert.

Fuck, I'm not taking Robert.

I'm taking you, timid Teddy.


[Robert] Timid Teddy?

[Jen] Triple dog?

[Lisa] You guys
know what'll happen

if we get caught, right?

[Jen] God'll get ya.


[Lisa] Seriously, Derek.

It's a church.

Shut up, Lise.

So come on, pussy lips.

You in?


[Berty] All right.

Yes.

Grab the flashlight,
dude (laughing).

[Berty] Beep if anybody comes.

You got it, Berty.

[Berty] Seriously.

Somebody comes, I'll beep.

[Boggs] Dude, and no
shenanigans while we're gone.

Give me the keys.

[Berty] Beep three times,
like beep, beep, beep.

Give me the keys.

Give me the fucking keys.

(keys jingling)

Whatever, dude.

[Boggs] That's right.

[Jen] You guys want
some flashlights?

[Boggs] Oh yeah,
give me those.

Here, Berty.

(footsteps pattering)

Just wait 'till
you see this thing.

Come on, Berty.

Let's go.

(grass crunching)
(insects buzzing)

[Berty] I don't know, Boogs...

[Boggs] What the fuck?


(flies buzzing)

Come on, Berty.

Whoa!



Damn, dude.

Here.

[Berty] Let's go.

Hang on, man.

(footsteps pattering)

(music box twinkling)

[Berty] What's that?

(music box twinkling)

Boggs, can we just go?

[Boggs] Hang on, man.

(footsteps pattering)

Who are you, Let's go, Larry.



It's just a mouse, dude.

[Berty] Can we go?

Please.

[Boggs] Oh man, we
should call the library.

See if there's a
reward for this one.

Oh dude, check these out.


I want one of these for my room.

Good citizen at school.

Obey school rules.


[Berty] Can we go?

Hang on, dude.

A good citizen
keeps good posture

when sitting,
standing, and walking.

These are hilarious.

Good citizen is fit and healthy

in mind and-

(car horn blowing)

[Berty] What...

Come on, Boggs, let's go.

Who's that?


God, Boggs.




Dude, there's no
other way. (static)

(music box playing)

Dude, run!

(footsteps pattering)

Come on, Berty.

[Berty] I'm come...

(footsteps pattering)


Where are they?

[Boggs] What are
you talking about?

[Boggs] What the hell?

(footsteps pattering)

[Boggs] Where
the fuck are they?

(engine starting)

Oh!

Those fuckers.

It was them.

God.


I wish I had a camera
right now. (laughing)

[Boggs] You bastards.

Which one of you
guys was up there?


[Boggs] Wait, check it out.

Hey, Lise.

Mom's making some
Salisbury steak

and thick gravy for dinner.



Every time.



Berty. Phone.

All right, be quiet.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, could I have a four
dick salad sandwiches

with some extra butt sauce?


Hey dude, I gotta stay
at your house tonight.

Yeah, cool.

All right.

Bitch.

Your bitch.


[Robert] Probably just a
dirty filter or something.

Or bad spark plugs, maybe.

Yeah, or it's a
big piece of poop.

(footsteps pattering)

[Robert] All right, I'll film.

Ah, no shit.

(door creaking)

(door unlocking)

(door shutting)

(stairs creaking)

(low television sound)


Hit the switch.

(switch flipping)


(Hey, good mornin', Berty)

(siren continues)


(siren continues)

We'll be outside, Berty.

Get outta here!

We'll be just outside.

[Berty] Get out of here!


Did you get that?


What?

Hi, bitch.

[Boggs] What's up, slut?
Nice to see you (kissing).

Get out of here.

Get out, you're too
close (laughing).

Just wait 'till
you guys see this.

What happened?

[Boggs] It's awesome.

[Lisa] What happened?

Boggs, shut up.

(footsteps pattering)

Whoa, sweet.

(mumbling in background)

Berty, why don't you
pull you socks up?

Pull those up, man.

You'll look cool, you'll
be like my grandpa.


[Boggs] Are you okay there...

Why did I listen to you?

Ow (laughing).

[Boggs] There's a very...

Yeah.

[Boggs] All right.

I've never tried a
threesome before, so...

[Boggs] Rob,
she said she's in.

Uh, I don't know what
you're taking about.

[Boggs] Bullshit.

We were talking about you.

[Boggs] That's
what I'm thinking.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

We're just talking
about like what

a fucking dumb ass you are.

[Boggs] Uh-huh.

Can we do stuff that
normal teens do, like
just...smoke pot and drink..

[Boggs] Fuck
normal teens, man.

You don't have to be
part of the system.


[Robert] Down
with the machine.

Lisa has a huge
crush on Robert.

[Lisa] Shut up.

[Boggs] Who can blame her?

He's pretty.
I know.


Are you attracted to him?

For real.

[Boggs] What?

Do you like Robert?


If I ever leave you,

I'm going right over there.

[Boggs] Oh, I don't
blame ya. (laughing)

You ever break my heart,

he's gonna be there
to pick those pieces

right back up.
Oh, yeah.

[Boggs] Berty,

even though you can't hear me

'cause you're
always off in that,

spaced out, fucked up little
Berty world of yours...

[Robert] He hotter
than you. (laughing)

[Boggs] I love you.

You dirty little
piece of man whore.

I love you.


I knew you didn't
have those things on!

I knew it!


Ah!

(rock music)

[Boggs] Oh, that is awesome.

[Robert] Let's
fucking go, man.

[Boggs] Look, it's them.

No, it's not.

[Boggs] Who the
fuck else drives that?


[Lisa] Really.


Dude, cut it, cut it!


[Boggs] Give me one
of those. (mumbling)

[Jen] Oh, shit.

[Boggs] Shit, (mumbling)

(door opening)

(can shaking)

[Lisa] Oh my god...


[Robert] He's so dumb.


What the fuck you doing?


[Jen] What's he doing?

[Boggs] I don't know.

[Boggs] Who the fuck is that?

Ahem!

Ahem.


[Robert] You okay?

[Boggs] Everybody cough fake.


Creep.


MTV?

[Boggs] Yeah.

Well, why not?

'Cause there's two
members of your band

and they both suck.

[Robert] Whoa (laughing).

[Boggs] What are
you talking about?

We're the hot new duo
on the music scene.

Ain't that right, Bobby?

Right.

Why don't you want a new car?

I don't know.

It's free.

I don't know, maybe
it's more fun parking

that piece of shit
in her driveway.


Guys.

What?

[Berty Who is that?

[Boggs] Check out that hat.

[Lisa] Don't.

Fine.

[Lisa] Oh, shit.

Go!

(footsteps pattering)

Didn't I tell you?

His little boyfriend, I knew it.

[Lisa] What else does it say?

[Jen] Haunted Ohio.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Read It, It's Cool!

[Jen] Oh, that's fascinating.

Hearse, haunted school bus.

Satanic church.

The church with some
upside down cross on it

The highway to hell.

The crazy house in the woods.

No wonder we're here
every fucking day.


Gimme it.


[Jen] I wasn't
done reading them.

[Boggs] Fucking wrestlers.

Oh.

Ah.

Highway to hell.

Crazy house in the woods again.

I can't hold him any longer.

Can we go to the
satanic church?



Get off.

Get off.


Wait, I wanna go to the church

with the upside down cross.

I don't know.

Maybe he owns this land.

He owns a state park?

Maybe he works for
the park service?


[Boggs] Ow!

Ah, mother fucker.

[Berty] You okay?

[Boggs] Ah, damn it.

The fuck was that?

[Jen] You are bleeding.

Oh, God.

[Boggs] Is it bad?

[Jen] Yeah.


[Boggs] Oh, shit.

[Jen] You're gonna need
like stitches or something.

[Boggs] Don't
worry about it, here.

Gross.


Hey, I'm bleeding.

You can't...

No one's answering.

Yeah, we know.

Let's go.

You don't even remember

Nope.

It all happened so fast.

Hey, I'm still here, ya know.

Just like Canada, too, huh?


So, what part of Canada
were you in again?

I don't remember.

[Boggs] Mmm.

Montreal, I think.


Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.


Whatever, dude.


So, you see any action
up there? (coughing)

I think it's weird that you
went on a trip to Canada

a couple years ago,

and none of us, you know,

your closest and
dearest friends,

don't seem to remember that.


I mean, Lis,

you don't remember that, do you?


Jen?

[Jen] Nope.

And Berty, you

Yeah, okay.

Shit.

Ah, look.

It's Lisa's boyfriend.

Um, pardon me, ma'am.

Yes?

We're doing a
report for school

and I was wondering if I
can ask you some questions

about the Boston Mills area?

[Waitress] Sure.

[Boggs] So, when
was it founded?

Um...

1806, I believe.

Right, Ray ?

1806.

Oldest village in Summit County.

Used to be a mill town.

A paper mill.

[Boggs] Oh, are there
still paper mills?

[Ray] No, son.

They've been gone
for some time now.

Norm here, he can tell
you just about anything

about Boston Mills, son.

Norm.

Hm?

He's doing a paper
for Civics class.

[Norm] Okay.

His brother, Kenny,
worked at the mills.

Give 'em a little lesson, Norm.

Well, built the
first mill in 1820

and the railroad
came through Boston

at around 1880.

Town flourished for years.

But by the...

[Boggs] Yeah, that's
not really interesting

but why do they call
it Hell Town, Ray?


[Waitress] So, that's
what this is all about?

[Boggs] Oh, well I was
just wondering, ma'am.

Well, it is the
seventh of June.

[Boggs] Okay.

[Ray] Isn't school
out for the summer, son?

[Boggs] Well, um...


Need a refill?

You always like it topped off.

Hey, Norm.

Norm, you okay?

(door creaking)


[Boggs] Yeah, sure.



Gotta get back in the studio.

Oh, shut up.


[Boggs] You should
join our band.

Yeah, do backup.

[Lisa] Okay, Derek.

Backup?

You guys don't
even have a singer.


[Boggs] We're so good we
don't even need a singer.

Just drums and guitar.

[Jen] Oh, God.

[Boggs] I'm serious, Lisa.

I mean, dad told me you
rock on the skin flute.


Yeah, you can play that.

Ha, ha.

[Boggs] Here he
comes, here he comes.


Uh-oh.


Uh-oh.



[Boggs] Oh, sorry, Cappy.


Hippy trash



Dirty bird, got your ears on?


[Dirty Bird] This is Bird.


We got a problem here.

Bus lost a fucking wheel.


[Dirty Bird] You

Uh, what do you think?


[Berty] Should we just go?

[Boggs] No way.

We are fucked.

[Robert] Yeah.

[Berty] Yeah, hold on.

Wait, there's trucks.


[Robert] By the truck?

[Boggs] Yeah.

no, there it is, whoa.

Back up, back up, back up.

[Jen] See what?

Go see if there's

[Boggs] Can you be more
careful with my shit?

[Jen] Derek, there's
someone in there.

[Boggs] Bullshit. You just
said that a little while ago.

There's nobody in there.

Don't worry about it.

I saw someone.

I didn't see you wasting
any time either, Derek.

[Lisa] Yeah, Derek.

[Boggs] I was just
worried about my camera.

[Robert] We'll watch
it when we get home.

[Boggs] Check that shit up.

[Robert] Dude,

Okay.

You know, sometimes, I just
don't know why we don't

leave your dead ass home.

[Jen] Double dog?

[Boggs] Me.

[Jen] I dare you to
see if anyone's sleeping

I don't think

Maybe they're deaf.


[Boggs] Yeah, deaf retards.

No, twin deaf retards.

When I looked
through that window,

that was creepy.

[Lisa] I wouldn't go
back there if you paid me.

I can't believe this.

You guys are all pussies.

[Berty] No fucking way.

[Robert] Quadruple dog.


[Boggs] Yeah, we're coming!

[Child With Camera]
Hello, Mrs. Conger.

Hey, Hobart.

If you are mad at people,

I won't see you.

[Woman] I mean,
why wouldn't you?

That gives us...

[Woman] Thinking... the
mind is thinking here.

You know, always thinking.

[Stranger] Yeah.

[Woman] It'll come
up with something.

[Stranger] Another
surprise, right?

[Woman] We'll have some
unique packaging, though.

Don't worry about
it, for God's sakes.

We're country folk.

[Stranger] Oh, boy.

[Child With Camera] Rusty.

(footsteps pattering)

Rusty.

(footsteps pattering)

Rusty!

(footsteps pattering)

(dog barking)

Rusty!

(engine rumbling)

I think so.

After Sadie's, we wanna
stop by the market.

[Driver] What do you need?

[Woman In Passenger Seat]
A few things for dinner.

What are we having?


You had your choice.

The radio or that.

(footsteps pattering)

Here we go (groaning).

You got it?

(footsteps pattering)


Hello.

Hi.

Here we go.


Thank you.

Oh, you're very welcome.


For you here.



You're a real pip,
you know that, Hobe?



A real pip.

[Man With Mustache] Oh,
you be careful out there.

[Man In Hat] Oh, I know.

[Man With Mustache]
It's getting icy.

[Man In Hat] Yeah, yeah.

[Cameraman] That's
the story, right?

All right.

I'll go do that right...

You ready to go, son?
