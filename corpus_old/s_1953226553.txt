Katelin, voice over: Hi. My
name is Katelin Kingsford,

but my friends call me...
Dork.

Katelin: Well, they're not
exactly friends.

They're the competition...

Fall! Fall! Fall!

Katelin:
And I'm the girl to beat.

Show-off.

Katelin: I was told that jealousy
is the highest form of flattery.

Of course it hurts a little.

But if they didn't hate me so much,

then how would I know how good I was?

These are 'rents, ed and Linda.

They're loving, supportive...

Whoo!

Whoo!

That's my girl!

Katelin: And incredibly
embarrassing.

The craniac next to them
is my brother Bradley.

Sure he's a geek,

but he also has the best
slap shot in the state.

Bradley has no respect for us twirl girls.

Still, my parents always make him come.

My coaches Bob and ginger
have trained me forever.

Ginger does my hair and makeup.

She makes me sparkle.

Bob, my choreographer, says
he has more moves in him

than all the rockettes combined...

Whoever they are.

Pop and pop!

Katelin:
I love Bob and ginger.

They are spectacular human beings.

But the truth is...

They're never gonna get my picture

on the cover of a cereal box.

For that, you need a Russian.

Natasha Goberman makes
figure skating champions

as easily as I can fake a smile.

It is my dream to one day
train with someone

of her caliber and nationality.

After all, I am the best.

But I need a scrunchy.

How about a barrette?

Aah! Don't you know
anything about skating?

I do.

Here, take mine.

Really?

Yeah, sure.

I'll just use my lucky rubber band instead.

Thanks.

No prob.
Now go get 'em.

Katelin: Let's face it.

The karmic brownie points I just earned

would be invaluable in today's competition.

Not that I need any help.

I'm a lock to win.

Katelin: Or so I thought.

My lucky rubber band was kinda old.

And who knew that rubber didn't retain
its integrity as long as a scrunchy?

Oh, well.
The damage was done.


Push!

Was it my Axel?

And your lutzes and your spins.

And that dress?
Come on.

Katelin: While the criticism
wasn't very nice,

it certainly wasn't unfounded.

They say you're either
a Britney or a Christina.

But here on the ice,

you're either a Kristi
Yamaguchi or a Tonya Harding.

Both have their merits,

but only one has a gold medal.

Girl: Have you
seen her legs?

Second girl:
She's such a klutz.

Did you see her fall?
It's a sad fact.

Katelin:
They were all Tonyas.

It was a tiny
over-rotation,

not a bad perm on school picture day.

Don't worry about a thing.

I don't think anyone even noticed.

And besides, the rest of
your routine was ice.

The judges love you.

Katelin: Liars.
All of them.

But what can you do?

We all need comforting at a time like this.

I was terrible!

I know, I know.
What was I thinking?

Where's my scrunchy?

Katelin...
honey...

with your technical
score and choreography...

they couldn't deduct a single point.


Katelin:
They deducted 5 points.

So maybe I'm not the best
skater in the world yet.

But with the right coaching
and the right scrunchy,

one day, I'm going to be.

Let's break training.
Who wants a

frozen yogurt?!
Frozen yogurt?!

[Russian accent] Excuse me, I'm...

Natasha Goberman!
Natasha Goberman!

Ah. You know my work.

There isn't a skater or a coach
worth her salchow who doesn't.

You flatter me.

Do you mind if I have a word with the girl?

No.
Go right ahead.

You want to talk to me?

No.

I want to make you a star.

Oh!

Here you go.

Sputnik, you were a firecracker on the ice.

Your jumps were Miles
above any girl out there.

Really? I'm that good?

Oh, no. Your artistry
is twitchy.

Your technique needs training,

and a little less with the jazz hands.

Oh.
But...

You could be that good.

Let me ask you question.
Why do you skate?

Well, that's easy.
Because of the glitter.

Oh.

And because when my
blades touch that ice...

Wow.

what I'm supposed to do

and how I'm supposed to act,

and no one can judge me.

Well, except for the judges, of course.

Sometimes I feel like if I
don't skate, I'll scream.

And that, my little sputnik,
is why I'm here.

It would be my honor to train you.

Katelin:
Am I dreaming this?

This is no dream.

It's nightmare.

But those who survive it
are among the best in the world.

I wanna be the best in the world.

Then you must train with me
at Buckston academy.

I'm the head coach
of the figure skating club.

And with the right coaching,
by yours truly,

you could be champion.

Katelin: Champion. Hmm.

Boarding school?

Yes, mom.
I have to go.

No, you don't.

There's nothing wrong with

the high school you're at now.

You're getting a fine education.

Mom, this isn't about my education.

It's about my future.

It's too expensive.

We could use my college money.

Guess again, katelin.


We're tapped out, kid.
The well is dry.

But I have to train
with her. She's Russian.

Natasha Goberman is the
toughest coach on ice.

You wouldn't last a day with her.

Mother!

Now the only thing you have to do

is go upstairs and bring
me down your dirty whites.

Could you hand me the remote before you go?

Katelin: Uhh! Do you believe they
actually let these two reproduce?

Hey, Brad. How goes?

Do you ever knock?

Geometry homework.
Yeech!

Wrong again, Einstein.
They're hockey positions.

See, hockey is just geometry on ice.

Whatev! I have
a serious problem.


Your rare hockey puck collection.

Get out!

Bradley, please?

I need the money for tuition...

And you'd be the very first
person I thanked on the podium.

Hmm. No!

how selfish you are.

Me?!

You want me to give you
my most prized possession

just so you can
flunk out of boarding school?

And win a gold medal.

Katelin...

You're the most spoiled,
self-absorbed,

Prima Donna twirl girl I've ever met.

I'm not self-absorbed.

I did that walkathon.
Ha!

You walked a half a block

and only raised $3.00
for "models without mascara."

Ok! Ok! So the walkathon
wasn't my finest hour,

but you don't have to be
such a weenie about it.


Oh, big deal.
Hockey, hockey, hockey.

Get out!


And there better not be one
puck missing when I get back,

or there won't be
a safe place for you to hide.

Uhh!

Miss Goberman, my well is dry.

Do you know what it's like
to be so close to your dream

and then have it ripped out
from under you just like that?

No...

But I do know what it's like to be shut out

of the first 2 world championships

and see your future slipping away

quicker than Pierogis at
Vladimir putin dinner party.

Huh?

Listen, sputnik,

I need champion again.

I need you.

Mmm!

I have idea.

Wait here.
I be right back.

Have you lost your mind?

No... And I hate
second opinions.

Look, I've got one scholarship
position to fill this year,

and it ain't gonna be with her.

She's spunky.

She's too tiny to play hockey.

Ah, but that's her advantage.

She can get in and out of places

your girls couldn't even dream of.

But those legs!

You are looking at the only
skater under 16 years of age

who has ever done a triple
Axel in competition.

Really?
Would I lie?

To get what you want?

Would I lie to you, morty?

Natasha, my team is bad enough as it is.

This recruitment's my one chance to
get some fresh blood in the lineup.

I'd owe you.

What you say?


The way I see it, there are only 3 things

that are gonna get your
figure skater on my hockey team.

Yes?

You, me, and a restaurant by the sea.

Pick me up at 8:00.

A scholarship?
Oh, I can't believe it.

Welcome to Buckston academy.

You start hockey training in a week.

Hockey?!

Don't you mean figure skating?

No.

This school doesn't offer
scholarship for figure skating.

No high school or college
in the country does.

How unfair is that, America?

But I can't play hockey.

I'm only getting
a c-minus in geometry.

What does that have to do with hockey?

You have to ask my brother,
although I don't recommend it.

Plus, those uniforms are hideous.

I can't do it.

Katelin, listen to me.

Everyone knows you cannot pull
fish out of pond without labor.

Do you want to train with me?

Yes.

Do you want to be the best?

Yes!

Do you want you face on cereal box?

More than anything!

Then there is no alternative.

You will play hockey.

Here is your schedule.

When will I find time to train?

In the blocks I marked in red.

Now... Go get your fish.

[Dog barks]

Wow.
Ha ha!

What's going on?

I though we couldn't play
hockey in the house?

Didn't you hear? Katelin
got a hockey scholarship.

What?!

She doesn't even know how to play!

Come on, Bradley.
How hard can it be?

I just scored 3 points off of dad.

You mean she...

But I'm the one...

Are you kidding me?!

It's no joke.

Oh, that's 4.

See? Ha!

Wow. This
is so easy.



Oh, mom, you're not still sad, are you?

I'm not sad.
I'm excited.

I think this boarding school's
gonna be a great thing for you.

My little girl's growing up.

Yes, she is.

Ok, kids.
In the trunk.

What about leaving the plushies at home?

Mom, I can't go to school
without my old friends.

This is a chance for you
to meet new friends,

real ones this time.

Mom, I'm not going to Buckston
academy to make friends.

I'm going there to skate.


You're gonna learn that there's a lot
more to life than figure skating.

Not for me.

There could be.

No.

Katelin: I thought
balance was balance,

but I can barely stand
on these hockey skates.

Life is a game, eagles!

Hockey is not.

And when you stepped onto this ice today...

Excuse me.
I'm totally lost.

Could someone please tell me

where the girls hockey team is practicing.

We <i>are the girls hockey team.</i>

Oh. Right on.

Kingsford, you're late!

Where was I?

Life is a game, ladies.

Hockey is not.

Is he for real?

Shh!

...everything that you believe
to be truth is no longer true.

I can do this.

If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.

They're just girls, just like me,

except bigger and meaner

with unconditioned hair.

I can do this.
I can do this.

We are a unit on this ice.

We all operate together.

And when you put those jerseys on,

you made a commitment
to give your lives to me.

Now...
coach.

What? What? What, Spencer?
I'm on a roll here.

What's up with number 36?

What's going on?

Oh. She's, um...

She's our secret weapon.

But she can barely keep her helmet up.

It's all part of the strategy.

All part of the strategy, Spencer.

Now may I continue?

Proceed.

That commitment began the moment
you stepped on this ice today,

and it won't stop until
you give me your last breath

or a championship ring.

Yeah. Well, why don't
we just make a promise

to do out best out there,
all right, ladies?

Didn't he say this last year?

Sorry.

These shoulder pads are
so not from our generation.

Here, katelin.

Why don't you try this on for size?

Uhh! Ok.

Oh, wow. I love the fit,
but do you have it in orange?

Yeah, that's on the top of my list.

All right, ladies.
Let's practice.

[Blows whistle]

Move, girls!
Move! Let's go!

Let's go, 36!
Move! Move! Move!

Coach: Come on, ladies!
Pick it up!

Spencer: What are you doing?
Let's go! Hustle!


Oh, no.
Oh, no.

Uhh!

Coach: Somebody
get her up.

Note to self:
No toe pick.

Must practice stopping on edges.

[Blows whistle] Come on, girls!

Move! Move! Move!
Let's go! Let's go!

Come on! Dig, girls! Dig!

Kid's got potential.

She's bootsy.

I know. She's great.

Bootsy means terrible.

I know that.

Coach: Come on, girls!
Let's move it! Move it!

Let's go!
Come on!

36, you're a disaster out there!

You're not supposed to hit the cones.

You avoid the cones!

Yeah. They're just
in their way.

Ignore the cones.

[Blows whistle] Up...

And down!

[Blows whistle] Up...
Girls: Up!

And down!

[Blows whistle] Up...

And down!

Come on, 36. Up... Down.

Up. Down.

Excuse me, but I am not a number.

I have a name, and it's katelin.

Oh, really? Well, I have
another one for you:

Useless.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

Coach: Up... And down.

Uhh!
[Blows whistle]

[Bell rings]

Bradley! Bradley!

The robo wars.
The robo wars are coming.

Yeah, I know.
Keep it down, will ya?

I already entered.

You did? But what about
hockey practice every day?

How are you gonna do 'em both?

I'm not playing anymore.

But you love hockey.

Yeah, I know, but...

What's the point?

Girl: Feels a little better.

Second girl: You get
more rotation out of it?

[Rap music playing]

[Turns music off]

My bad.

[Turns music on]

Oh, man.

Wake me when the semester's over.

[Turns music off]

Well, ladies...

[Slams clipboard on ground]

That could have gone better,

but I'm sure that's no indication

of how the season will turn out,

right, eagles?

Right, eagles?

All: Right.

Hollywood,

I thought you told me you
were training this summer?

Yeah, you'd never know by your skating.

Mojo.

The puck isn't going to
magically find your stick.

Ha ha.
Not yet it isn't.

Ronnie, don't even get me started.

As captain, you gotta keep
these girls in line out there.

They look to you as an example.

Especially the freshmen.

How you feeling, kid?
A little tired?

If my legs could talk, they'd scream.

You'll get better. You
just need a little rest.

If she got any more rest,
she'd have bed sores.

Hey, stow it!

All right, ladies,

pick up your practice
schedules on the way out,

and I will see everybody
bright eyed and bushy-tailed

tomorrow morning, 7 A.M.


Coach!

I don't know about that.

If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.


That's right, I'm quitting.

I don't think so, kid.

You're on the team until I say you're not.

You can't be serious.

Oh, I am serious.

I broke a lot of rules
to get you that scholarship,

and if you quit now, people
will start asking questions.

And if people ask questions,
people get answers.

And if people get the right answers,

I could be in a lot of trouble, you follow?

You lost me at "oh,
I don't think so, kid."

Ok, let me make this perfectly clear.

You keep coming to practice,

I keep my job.

So I have no say in this matter at all?

None.

But you play your cards right,

you won't have to play a single game.

You'd really bench me?

Oh, that's the nicest thing

anyone's done for me
since I've gotten here.

Yeah, yeah.
I'm an angel of mercy.

Go change, will ya?
Oh, hey.

And I would keep my mouth shut

about the figure skating
club if I were you.

Why?

Because you don't wanna give these girls

any other reason to skin you alive.

I've always hated figure skaters.

I've got no idea why.

Maybe it's the leotards, I think,

or the glitter.

I love the glitter.
Ha ha!

Yeah.

Well, you just do what I say,

and we'll both get through the season

with our feathers intact.

Feathers?

You're an eagle now.

Oh, right.

Go team. Ha ha!

Go change.

Hi, I'm Amy Henderson.

Left wing.

Katelin kingsford.
Moderate conservative?

Funny.

I saw you at practice today. You were...

Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that.

You were awesome!

Yeah, well, you'll get better.

Honestly, my plan is just to stay alive.

No worries, it's not so rough.

Except for, like, the
checking, and the sticking,

and, oh, I should apologize
in advance for my snoring.

You snore.

It's actually really more
of, like, a whistle.

Where did you get that?

The danbury pro shop.
You like?

Me love.

It's hysterical.

It is?

She makes me wanna hurl.

Kristi yamaguchi?

Those twirl girls?

They should not be allowed
to call that skating.

I don't know, I mean,

sure looks like a lot of hard work to me.

Oh, please.

The skate club here is, like,

the biggest joke on campus.

I mean, you should see some of those

puny, plushy-collecting
freaks.

Ha ha ha.

So, where do we hang our new dart board?

[Knock on door]

Come on in!

Hey, what's up?

I'm exhausted.

Rough practice
today. Really rough.

But I love it.
The rougher the better.

Yeah, whatever.

You guys know katelin, right?

Yeah. You sure
bruise easily.

Thanks.

What are you doing?

My lucky dance.

Huh?

You wanna win a game this season,

don't you?

Sure, I guess.

Then leave me to my business.

So, Hollywood...

I'm really from Topanga.

We are so doomed.

The freshmen pickings are...

Pathetic.

And I just found out

Kathy broke her leg skateboarding,

and she's out all season.

Another embarrassing year ahead of us.

We're going to the student center.

All right, we'll see you there.

Hey, mojo.
Give her an extra shake.


She hates me.

Who, Ronnie?

She's a little intense,

but she's a great captain.

You just gotta know how to handle her.

Meditation helps.

So would a little lip gloss.

All right, ladies!

Show me your lutzes.

Excuse me.

Sorry, sugar, but I'm
number one on this rink.

I think bronze is more your color.

Then you know absolutely
nothing about colorology.

I'm a summer.

Shelby singer.

I thought you retired.

I'm only 17.

It's not like I'm 20.

Oh, no. No.

See, I didn't mean that in a bad way.

What I meant to say is I am a huge fan.

Save the sunshine for the cameras.

Ouch.

Pamela, you're up.

No amount of teeth is going
to convince the judges or me

that you
did not over-rotate.

But, miss Goberman, I was going to...

Pamela, on the ice as in the chicken Coop,

the egg do not teach the hens.

Next!

Well, we both know that was
a flutz and not a lutz.

Back of the line.

Next.

And that, ladies, is how
you perform a double lutz.

Thank you, sputnik.

Next.

Oh, yeah?

Well, I heard it was either

boarding school or jail for her.

Really?

Did her last routine bore someone to death?

As unamusing as your little story might be,

truth is she's here
on a hockey scholarship.

Hockey player?

Oh, my.
That's even worse.

Did you see her tape from sectionals?

She's pretty good.

I saw it.

And we dress our help in better outfits.

I don't care how she dresses.

I think she can skate.

I think she better stay off my ice.

And who choreographed her routine?

Clumsy the clown?

Stop right there.

Say what you want about me or my
costumes or ice hockey in general.

But when you insult Bob and ginger,

that is where I draw the line.

Oh, I'm sorry, but around here...

whatever you have to say,
save it for the ice,

'cause that's where I'll
be doing all of my talking.

Oh, kristi, I promise,

one day we'll look back at this and laugh.


Oh, hi,
Mr. jablonsky.

You hungry?

Starving.

Thank you.

Don't mention it.

And I mean that.

Sure thing, kid.

â™ª Hey there, girl â™ª

â™ª I've been asking around â™ª

â™ª the word on the street
is that you're new in town â™ª

â™ª in my dreams, we're... â™ª

Whatev.

â™ª In real life, I'm not
that much of a catch â™ª

What are you doing up so late?

Exam tomorrow. What are
you doing out so late?

Practicing my slap shot.

Whatev.

But it's so hard here.

I'm sure you're just
exaggerating just a little bit.

Hardly at all.

I told you this was gonna be hard.

Yeah, but, mom, I can't
get a break anywhere.

Remember, this is what you wanted.

Do you still want that pink sweater

you got from grandma last year?

With the butterflies?

No, why?

I'm having an Internet garage sale.

Getting rid of some of your old junk.

I go away to school, now
you're selling my stuff?

It's just stuff we don't need.

So, have you made any friends?

Just the janitor.

Oh, well, that's a start.

Say hello for me.

Sure thing. Bye.

He's all right, Tasha.

What he thought I think?

Don't know if my Katelin's about to fly.

Hmm.

I'm psyched.

Oh. Well,
you'd be surprised

how important presentation is out there.

Nervous?

About what?

The game.

Oh, don't worry about that.

See, I've been playing my cards right.

I don't think I'll be playing very much.

Do you?

All right, eagles, let's fly!

Let's ride!
Let's go!

Remember your skates this time, ok?

We're here at the Buckston arena

where the eagles are taking a beating

from the tarrytown tigers, 5 to nothing.

You want to put her in the game?

Well, she's here to play, isn't she?

Yes, but we're losing.

Then I say it's time for our secret weapon.

She's on scholarship, so
she has to play, right?

Right.

Katelin!
What?

Get in there.


Now!

Does anyone else think this is going to go

horribly, horribly wrong?

[Organ plays dirge riff]

Announcer:
Face-off center ice.


Tigers center steals the puck

and drives it toward the eagles' goal.

Come on, come on, come on,
beat her, beat her, beat her!

Why do you want him
to play katelin so badly?

It's one way of getting her to quit.

Please don't pass it.

Please, please don't pass it.

Ronnie is... ooh!
The tigers slam her.

They steal the puck and head down the ice.

Come on, katelin, stay with her!

Come on, katelin!

Come... [Groans]

What do you think you are doing?!

I'm doing the best I can.

She could get hurt.

She'll be fine.

Uhh!

Ohh!

Your first job was to keep her on the bench.

I'm getting too much heat
from the coaching staff.

Take her off the ice this instant.

My hands are tied.

Announcer:
Eagles drive down the ice...

katelin, block for me.

Too late.

She's met by
the tigers defense... ohh!

And kingsford leaves her
hanging out to dry.

That's it!
[Buzzer sounds]

The final buzzer sounds, and the tigers...

oh, she's a Tonya.

But what's this?

What kind of a hockey player

runs away from a fight?

The kind who doesn't want to break a nail.

Announcer: Lockwood
jumps into the air

and takes kingsford down.

Oh, that's gotta hurt.

Let me at her!

That's delinquent behavior, princess Ronnie!

Maybe you'd like to think about it
on the bench for the entire season!

Would that
make you happy?! Huh?

I knew you were gonna be trouble

from the moment I saw you.

Hey! She...

but I thought you were gonna
quit after the first week,

so I didn't say nothing.

But I...
spare me, 36.


She jumped me. Oh!

You got off easy.

What?!
She tackled me.

Compared to what she should've done to you,

you got off easy.

I wasn't even supposed to play.

You weren't?

No. Uh, I... I mean,
I'm a freshman

and, uh, I didn't think I'd
get that much ice time.

You didn't?


Because you were supposed to block for her.

You were her guard and you let her down...

Literally.

Let me see the bump.

I'll go get a mop.

No! I'll get it.

You wait here. Heh!

Just hurry.


Don't say it.
I knew it!

I said don't say it.

You're a twirl girl?
Shh!

Will you be quiet?

This is not a soundproof booth, you know.

This is off the hook.

I cannot wait to tell...

no. I can't tell
anyone.

Mm-mmm.

Do you know what they would do to you

if they found out about this?

Yes. They'd skin me alive.

Ooh, if you were lucky.

Come on, let's get out of here.

It's all so bootsy.

I know.

Why didn't you tell me?

After what you did to my kristi
yamaguchi poster, how could I?

Oh, that.

That's just healthy rivalry
between the sports.

You threw darts at her.

So it's not so healthy. Mmm.

But it... it's just because
I've never met one before.

Now you have.

Why put yourself through all that

just for figure skating?

Because, unlike my performance
on the hockey rink,

I'm a great figure skater,
and I want to be the best.

When I'm on the ice, and I nail a routine

and I mean really nail it,

and my heart is racing, and the
audience jumps to their feet,

it's like...

like that hat trick I scored
back in pee-wee hockey.

Yeah. I guess.

Look at Destructo go!

Yeah. Let's see katelin
build one of these.

What?

That's why you quit hockey, right?

The competition?

No, I told you, I quit
because it was pointless.

[Dog barking]

What do you know?

Watch out.


Uh-oh, it's coming back.

Run, Hooner, run!

Bradley, not responding!

It's shooting.

Aaah!
Aaah!


Back to the drawing board.

There.
That's what I want.

Focus. Still.

Champion.

Champion?

Not on my watch.

Katelin!

Congratulations.

You made the front page.

Just say what you want
and get it over with,

'cause I'm too tired
to fight everyone today.

Oh, stop it.

I'm trying to apologize.

I know I've been hard on you,

but, come on, you're my only
serious competition here.

Sorry, Heather.

I have to be a little jealous, right?

Of course you do.

And to make it up to you,

I'd like to invite you
to a party tomorrow night.

A party?
Yeah.

Oh, I can't.

I have
a 9:00 workout.

At night?

Yeah. Natasha's working
with my crazy schedule.

How sweet of her.

Well, it's too bad you're not
going to make the party.

The whole skate club will be there,

except for you, of course.

Well, I guess I could go
for a little while.


Oh. You can't
be serious.

Yeah. Totally serious.

I'll catch up with you guys later.

Hurry up.

Hey, katelin.

What are you doing here?

I'm reading <i>the great gatsby.</i>

What does it look like I'm doing?

I'm just surprised.

It's not like you're the
team's most dedicated player.

It's not dedication,
it's self-preservation.

Don't you have anything better
to do than to harass me?

No.

Ok, what's it gonna take
to get you off my ice,

a restraining order?

No.

I got a better idea.

Ok, secret weapon,
you get that puck past me

and I promise I'll never say
another word about you again.

I get this puck past you,

and you promise you'll
never say another word.

<i>Tome again.</i>

Deal.

Deal.

Wow. That was...

you promised.

And hold the position...


Bradley, that's it!
Get in here!

TV: Breathe in
through your nose...

What on earth are you doing?

Nothing.

...and out.

Ok. It's just
a residual effect

of the electromagnetic field

I'm trying to generate for my new robot.

Is it absolutely necessary?

I'm trying to relax here.

And I'm trying to build a robot

this family can be proud of.

We're proud of you, Bradley.

I was talking about the robot.

Well, how's it coming?

Well, I need someone to
discharge the excess static,

and dad's at work.

You need help?

So do I.

Help me get down from here.

TV: And out.



[Rock music playing]

Hey, katelin.

Party, party!

You guys, this party is so great.

I can't believe I almost missed it.

Oh, no! Katelin, we're out of paper cups.

Would you be a dub and go get another stack

from the supply room?

Party, party, I'm on it.

Are you sure this is a good idea?

Are you getting private
coaching from Natasha?

No.

Me either.

It's time we brought little
sputnik down to earth.


Help! Anybody!

Help! Anybody.


Help, anybody...

ah! Uhh!

Help. Anybody?

Help!

Help!

Help!

Help. Anybody?

Katelin?

What time is it?

It's 9:45.

Katelin?

Spare me, Spencer.

[Classical music playing]

Just like this.

Holy kristi yamaguchi, am I dreaming this?

No.

Kristi: Tilt your head
a little bit to the side.

Now let's see it.

Very nice.

Pamela. [Groans]

This is no dream.

This could have been you out there.

I invited kristi down here

as a little encouragement

for all your hard work,

but I think I might have
been wrong about you.

All right.
Now let's see,

arm up.
Bring your arm back.

Great, Pamela.
Nice job.

But miss Goberman, I didn't...

Ms. kingsford, whatever is going on with you

is obviously between you
and your hairdresser.

You are wasting my time.

I didn't...
no, no.

You could have been training with kristi.

You were late.

Something was obviously
more important to you.

So you blew it.

Anything wrong besides your
hair matching your pants?

Miss Goberman hates me.

That old Russian bear?
She's not so scary.

She is the best coach out there,

and you're lucky to be training with her.

You know, she told me she thinks
you could be one of the best.

She did?

She's not too free with compliments.

Sorry you got to take off so quickly,

but maybe next time I'm around

we can skate together.

There is a next time?

Listen, katelin,

Natasha says you've got talent,

but you have to decide if you want
this enough to go the distance.

Natasha: You.

Thanks.

Good.

Oh, b-plus.

Whoo-hoo!

â™ª I laugh out loud at nothing â™ª

What did you get?

I aced it.
â™ª I never have time â™ª

â™ª to win my turn â™ª

â™ª crash goes my world â™ª

â™ª bang, bang, bang â™ª

â™ª bang, bang â™ª

â™ª bang goes my universe â™ª

â™ª boom, boom, boom â™ª

â™ª crash goes my world â™ª

Hey, katelin.

Hey, what?

What are you doing here?

â™ª Bang, bang, bang â™ª

I have no idea anymore.

â™ª Bang goes my universe â™ª

â™ª boom, boom, boom â™ª

â™ª crash goes my world â™ª


[Ringing on line]

Bob? Ginger?

We're here, honey.

What's wrong?

How did you know anything was wrong?

I had one of my feelings.

I made a big mistake.
I'm coming home.

Well, you hurry back to us...

And with the new skating season
just around the corner...

We're gonna pick up your training

right where you left off.

Yeah. Who needs a Russian

when we can take you right to the top

of the junior novice championship?

Oh.

Oh, she's upset.

[Crickets chirping, dog barking]

[Katelin crying]

Yes! I knew it!
Pay up, dad.

You were betting I would quit?

No, kitten. I was betting you wouldn't.


What? Easy money.

Just like your walkathon.

Oh, not that again!
Mom?

Well, honey, you can't say

I didn't see this coming.


You thought I would fail?
My own mother.



[Door opens]

What did you do with my bed?

I needed the space.

My Internet business is taking off.

You sold my bed on the Internet?

No, I just...
I just moved it

to the garage until semester break.

I thought you would've at
least called before you quit.

Honey...

Look...

I'm so sorry.

This is the last thing
I wanted to see happen.

My plushies are not junk.

What kind of monster are you?


Frankie and Dee Dee.

Oh, and there's suki
and patches and Jeannie.

Guys, what are we gonna do?

What is all this stuff?

Oh, wow.

I knew you skated.
I mean, you taught me.

But I didn't know about all this.

You were a twirl girl?

Guilty.

Look at all these medals.

You were really good.

I was gonna be the best.

What happened?

Gravity.

And weak ankles.

Then I had you and Bradley.

Why didn't you ever tell me
about any of this before?

I was scared.

Maybe even a little jealous.

Oh, mom.

I'm sorry if I was hard on you,

if I didn't seem like the
most supportive mother,

but I know how hard that life is.

Believe it or not, I was
trying to protect you.

I didn't want to see you disappointed.

Where are you going?

Well, I've realized 2 things tonight.

1... that despite my performance
in the walkathon,

you and dad did not raise a quitter,

and 2... with all my hockey training,
I have stronger ankles than you.

I'm going back to Buckston.
I'm gonna finish what I started,

and I'm gonna kick some ice.

Where's our little girl?

Bob, ginger...

You don't have to say a word.

Pop and dazzle, sweetheart,

pop and dazzle.

Good luck, kitten.

It's katelin, daddy.

Katelin.

Could this get any worse?

Ohh, darling.

Hey, Bradley, I believe you owe me 20.

Ginger:
You'll do great.

He said that?

Yeah, right.

I don't wanna know who
you're talking about.

Let's go, girls.

â™ª ...over the rainbow â™ª

â™ª I wanna be the girl who has everything â™ª

â™ª I wanna reach that bell,
I'm gonna make it ring â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna fly like a bird
and spread my wings â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, come on,
give me everything â™ª

Nice, ladies, nice.
Nice, nice.

Way to go, katelin.

You know what we got here, Spencer?

What?
We got a team.

We got a class "a" team.

A class "a" team this year.

Nice.
Nice.

Looking sharp, ladies, looking sharp.

â™ª So don't bet against me â™ª

â™ª I know it's gonna happen â™ª

Ooh, need help?
I got it. Here we go.

Ah! [Laughs]

â™ª I'm goin' the distance, not to mention â™ª

â™ª I wanna be the girl who has everything â™ª

â™ª I wanna reach that bell,
gonna make it ring â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna fly like a bird
and spread my wings â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, come on,
give me everything â™ª

â™ª I see stars, and I can tell you â™ª

â™ª you ain't seen, no, nothin' yet â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna grab
the great big golden ring â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, I want everything â™ª

All right!
Way to go, katelin!

Let's go.

â™ª I wanna be the girl who has everything â™ª

â™ª the girl who says it's good to be me â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna fly like a bird
and spread my wings â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, I want everything â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, come on, come on â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, give me everything â™ª

â™ª I see all that I can get â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna grab
the great big golden ring â™ª

â™ª come on, come on, I want everything â™ª

Oh! Bradley was right!

I'm telling you now, morty,
as sure as the gull flies west,

you will keep katelin off the ice,

or you have not heard the last
of Natasha Goberman.

[All talking at once]

Here, let me help you with that.

Thanks.

Is that glitter?

Presentation is very important out there.

I like it.

[Taps boots] You sparkle.

So do you.

Eagles on 3. 1, 2, 3!

Eagles!
Eagles!

Let's go!

Wildcats 2, eagles 1, with 15
minutes to play in the last period.

[Whistle blows]

Come on, you've seen me in practice.

Put me in. I can do it.

I know what's best for the team.

We might actually be able to tie this one.

Obviously, you don't know
what's best for the team

'cause we could actually win this one.

Sit.

Sit!

Or I'll bench you
for the rest of the season.

Oh!

A break in the action now as Mary
"mojo" Johnson is taken from the ice.

I broke my wishbone!

Check her collarbone while you're at it.

We need katelin, coach.

Becky! You're in.

Katelin is our secret weapon, coach.

The big girls can't touch her.

She moves like lightning. We need her.

No.

More than you need your
little Russian friend.

You know?

I'm the only one who knows.

So far.

Put her in.

Katelin! On the ice.

[Whistle blows]

I'm on it.

You better be right about this.

Lafedora drives down the ice,
looking for an open eagle.

She spots freshman katelin
kingsford but does not pass it.

Lafedora's blocked, loses it, but Amy
"Hollywood" Henderson picks up the puck.

She shoots! She scores!

And unbelievably the score is tied
at 2, and the crowd goes crazy.

Kingsford charges with the puck,

she's blocked by 2 wildcats,

takes her shot,
and, oh! She goes down.

[Whistle blows]

Kingsford really hammered on that play.

You ok?
I'm fine.

What's with the shirt?

It's for my chi.

Mandarin's my power color.

What?

Colorology.
It helps my game.

Whatever.

You sure you wanna play?

I'm not quitting.
There's 2 minutes left.

Ok, then. Go get 'em.

What's gotten into her?

Ronnie's stuck in a corner. Out
of nowhere in comes kingsford.

She gets the puck...

Acute angle is equal and opposite...

uff!

[Whistle blows]

Penalty, wildcats.

Official: Number 21,
penalty...

Oh, no. It looks like there might
be some trouble down in the ice.

You want a piece of me?

No, honey.
I want the whole thing.

Come on. What kind of hockey
player runs away from a fight?

Way to go, Kat.

Thanks, but I could've
handled it on my own.

Yeah.
But you don't have to.

Good job.

The game is tied at 2 apiece,
5 seconds left to play,

and the eagles get
one last shot at the goal.

Katelin to Ronnie.

Ronnie takes the shot.

She scores! She did it!


Buckston eagles have won
their first game of the season.

Get ready to party, Kat.
We're celebrating.

Me? Really?

Yeah, you!

We haven't won a game in 3 years.

Unless of course there's something
else you need to do again.

No.

Well, come on, then.

[Dance music plays]

Whoo-hoo!
[Crowd cheering]

I can't believe how much
fun it is to have friends.

You don't have any friends?

I have competition...

And they don't let you forget about it.

Well, that stinks.

It did.

Ha ha ha!

This music is...
Hip-hop.

I was gonna say phat.

[Both laughing]

â™ª Yeah yeah yeah â™ª

â™ª ba ba ba da da da â™ª

[Mechanical blips and beeps]

It's alive.

Sweet.

Unh!
Uhh!

If we play like we did last game,

we just might make something
out of the rest of the season.

You think?

I know.

We were great.

What, you don't think so?

Well, our game was on,

but I think I know how we can be better.

What are you thinking, Kat?

And over...

And up...

And over, and down.

This is ridiculous.

You're making us into twirl girls, katelin.

I am not.
This is ballet.

It will help improve your
balance and agility on the ice.

Trust me.

Just keep moving.

She knows what she's talking about.

Over and up...

And over and...

What do you have against
figure skaters anyway?

Everybody thinks only boys play hockey

and girls should just skate around
in circles in frilly dresses.

That's right.

Well, they do more than that.

And down...
And over...

They make it totally impossible
for us to get any respect.

Which is why we must
respect ourselves first.

Plus, I could never get my
butt that high off the ice,

unless it was flying over someone's stick.

Enough chatter.
We have plies to perfect.

And over...

aah-aah-aah!
Aah-aaaah!


Is this really going to help?

Hey.

Eagles shoot!
Score!

Another win for the buckston eagles!


â™ª The sun is shining down â™ª

Katelin:
I knew it, mojo.

You're spring.

â™ª Wish you were here to hear me say â™ª

â™ª this is gonna be my greatest day â™ª

Another victory for the eagles.

They are unstoppable.

â™ª Just to hear everybody say â™ª

â™ª this is gonna be my greatest day â™ª

I hate to admit it,

but I was wrong about you, katelin.

You can call me 36.

I said I was wrong.

I'm listening.

I can't believe the effect
you're having on them.

It's like they're a whole new team.

Pretty amazing.

[Bell tolling]

Oh, no, it's 4:00.

I... I'm gonna be late.

Spencer, I have to go now.

Hold on, cinderella.
I know.

Trust me, you don't, and I can't explain.

I have to go.

Skate club, right?

Skate club?

Listen, I knew something
was whack at the tryouts,

so I followed you one day.

Uhh! Stalker!

Katelin.

So now you know.

I've known for a while.

And you didn't say anything?

I thought I could use it against you later.

Nice.

Then I wanted to see how long
you could keep up that pace.

Ta-da!

Then I just wanted to see you.

Spencer.

Come on. Let's get you
to your practice.

And again.

Get up, shelby.

I can't.

Can't or won't?

What's the difference?

That's exactly the attitude

that cost you your medal.


Shelby?

Shelby: Go away.

Please, open up.

Can't you just leave me alone?

I want to help.

I've been in this business
too long to believe that.


Oh, shelby, no, no, no.

I... I know that you're
under a lot of pressure,

and I know Natasha's
criticism can be harsh,

but steroids are not the answer.

I'm not on steroids.

I'm diabetic.

Oh.

Yeah. Oh.

But I read all your BIOS and...

it's not something I advertise.

Last thing I want is the judges' pity

when I get so much of it on my own.

Want to get a frozen yogurt?

Sugar free.

I'm a has-been.

That's ridiculous.

Really? I've spent
my whole life skating

and training and performing,

and what do I have to show for it?

Nothing.

Are you kidding?

You won 3 world championships,

and you skated at salt lake.

Yeah, but I didn't place.

And without a gold medal,

they won't even remember my name.

But your skating is so tight this year.

I'm working twice as hard as I ever have

just trying to make the team.

Then you came along...

this season's new sputnik.

You're good...
Really good.

I don't know what I'm gonna do

if I don't make it this year.

Look, shelby,

I never thought I'd say this,

but there's more to life
than figure skating.

Talk to me when you're 17.

2 frozen yogurts, please.

So you see, as long as Ronnie and Hollywood

stay inside the obtuse angle and...


I know. I didn't really
get it at first either,

but it's way cool.
Just watch.

No, no, I get it.
This is gonna work.

Hey, what's going on in here?

I think katelin just found a way

to raise
the team's G.P.A.

And win the game on Saturday.

You go, girl!

Mojo: Oh, my gosh.

Ronnie: Yeah.
Good idea.

We're gonna do the wave.
Everyone ready?

Here we go.
Ready? Go!


One more time!
Here we go. Ready?


Announcer: Ronnie drives
with the puck,

and... She scores!

Oh, was that
a jumping demi-plie?

Listen to the crowd roar

as the eagles continue

the rampage of the Matawan huskies.

They lead 4 to 1.


And how about that?

The eagles, against all odds,

have captured the east coast
division semi-finals.

All right!

All right, ladies,

you play like that on the 19th,

and the championship is ours!

Aah!

The championship.

I haven't been able
to say that word in 7 years.

Championship.

All right, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies,

celebrate a little,

sleep a lot,

and I'll see you tomorrow for speed drills.

Championship.
Whoo!


Wait a minute.
Wait.

Did he just say the 19th

of this month?

Oh, yeah. Uhh!

It's the same day as the senior national.

Oh, no.

No. No, no, no, no.
I know what you're thinking.

Kat, you can't miss the national

if you want to go to the Olympics.

But...
no.

But...
no.

But...

no.


Katelin, it troubles me to say this,

but a girl who sits between 2
chairs may fall down easily.

What are you talking about?
I'm standing.

I am talking about if you
don't know what to do

then you have been checked into
the boards one too many times.

They're my friends.

Friends.
Who has friends?

Have I taught you nothing?

We are talking about the olympic qualifier.

Something you could only
dream about before me.

I owe them something.

What about what you owe yourself?

I hate to break it to you, sputnik,

but this light only shines
on us once every 4 years.

And when it goes out,

the world forgets all about little
girls in tights and sequins.

This is your shot.

This is your moment.

And what you do with it

will define you

for the rest of your life.

Thought I'd find you here.

You're a natural.

Got it from my mother.

So what are you gonna do?

Oh, I have no idea.

Well, watching you now,
it seems pretty obvious.

I used to think so,

but there's nothing like the rush

of a 2-on-1 breakaway

with a wrist shot to the sweet spot.

Well said.

Aren't you afraid you're gonna get hurt

playing hockey, though?

If I didn't play for the eagles,

I wouldn't be able to fly like one.

Oh, kristi yamaguchi, take me away!

But it's not my decision.

You tried to tel me
what to do my whole life,

and now you want me to think for myself?

Shocking, I know.

I just don't want to let you down.

Honey, you'd only be letting me down

if I thought you were compromising
yourself to please me.

Aha! So you admit it!

You want me to skate the national.

No, I want you to be happy.

But, mom, this is our shot.

No, this is your shot.

What would you do?

That's not the question
I'd be asking myself.

What would you ask?

What is gonna make you a better woman?

Does that help?

No.

Yes.

Barely.

I love you, too.

Thanks, mom. Bye.

Wow, it's mom's dress.

Ship to Mr. jablonsky.

C/o Buckston academy.

[Announcer on TV indistinct]

Look who's here!

Hey, Bob and ginger.

Everybody ready for Saturday?

We have a schedule.

I'm making cookies.

I didn't know you guys liked hockey.

Hockey?

Honey, what's he talking about?

The east coast championship
is this Saturday.

Katelin's team's in the finals.

Oh, no, ed.

Katelin has the national this Saturday.

Well, she can't do both.

Can't she?

Not according to the paper.

They both start at 5:00.

Yes!

Bob: What do you
think she'll do?

Well, the national, of course.

Well, if I know my katelin,

that's where I would put my money.

I wouldn't bet on it.

I would.

Brad, what's going on?

Nothing.

Bradley.

I'm just trying to finish my robot,

and I'm having some scuzzy conflict.

[Mechanical bleeps and blurps]

I sure do miss your hockey days.

Let katelin play hockey all she wants.

I've got this robot.

You quit hockey because of katelin?

Well...

I should've been the one with
the scholarship, not her.

Hockey was my thing, and she
had to take that over, too.

Oh, not again, Bradley.

It's not a competition with your sister.

It's not a competition
because she always wins.

Brad, you're the reason she's winning.

If you returned any of her
phone calls, you'd know that.

She's using your geometry
plays with the eagles,

and now they're unbeatable.

She's been calling to thank you.

Well, what do you know?

You finally have something
in common with your sister.

Really?

Honey, there's room for 2
hockey players in this house.

You should give her a call.

I have to get back to my robot.

I'll think about it.

[Robot beeping]

Sandwich?

You read my mind.

Oh, thanks, Mr. jablonsky.

Don't mention it.

Natasha: What you do

will define you for the rest of your life.


Mother: What's gonna make you
a better woman?

Eeny, meeny, miney, mo,

catch a tiger by the toe.

Uhh!

Grr!

Rrr!

Rrr!

Arr!

Aah! Rrr! Rrr!

Grrr!

It's a grudge match today
as the buckston eagles

take on the tarrytown tigers

for the east coast conference championship.


[Chanting quietly]

Ronnie, what's with the tape?

It's for our harmonic convergences.

And if that fails us, coach,

I've mixed up a special
something for the championship.


Uh! No, you just save the
magic for the ice, mojo.

Hey.

Any sign of her?

No.


P.A. Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to the senior
national championship.

She's listed in the program, dad.

Pay up.

I don't see her yet.

She'll be here.

Ladies and gentlemen, Cheryl hanson.


I thought she retired.

[Classical music playing]

What are you doing?

You're making a huge mistake.

Look, I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life,

and this is not one of them.

Don't throw away
everything you've worked for.

I'm not, Spencer.

I've worked hard for this,

for today, for this game.

As a figure skater, I was all alone.

But here I'm a part of something.

I need them, and they need me.

I'm their chi.

The girls would understand.

But I wouldn't.

Girl:
Hi, katelin.

Hey. How's the pain?

[Crowd cheering, organ playing]

Katelin!

<i>Et tu, hollywood?</i>

Let's go, eagles!

Whoo!

Hollywood and kingsford break down the ice.

Hollywood passes to kingsford.

She shoots. She scores!

And the eagles take command
1-nothing.

Yeah!
Whoo!

All right, ladies, let's keep up the steam.

It's still anybody's game.

Everyone in.

Eagles on 3.

1, 2, 3!

Eagles!
Eagles!

Let's go!
Look sharp, girls!

Look sharp!

Announcer:
Tigers with the puck.

Madsen cuts in,

easily breaks past the eagles' defense,

sets up for a shot...


Tigers begin to pounce.

They shoot. Score!

Come on, girls.

Tigers in control,
summers open at the point.

Wrist shot, scores!


Eagles move down the ice, to Hollywood.

Oh! She goes down!

Puck is loose in the corner.

Madsen... Passes it
to the front of the net,


Tigers 4, eagles 1 in this
slam fest championship game.

Come on, ladies, let's hold this together!

Come on, come on,
you got it! You got it!

[Buzzer sounds]
Oh! What was that?!

All right, ladies,
pull it in! Pull it in!

Let's go! Let's go!

Ok, we're down by 3,

but we are not out of this game yet.

Ah-choo!

When you take to that ice in 2 minutes,

I want you to own it.

This is our house.

It's our nest, eagles!

Right.
Right.

Let's show those tigers

what we think of tarrytown, all right?

Right!

All right, let's go, ladies!
Let's go!

Come on!

Will you give it up?

There's not enough
lucky powder on this planet

to help us win this game.

Let's just get it over with.

Excuse me, captain, I don't know about you,

but I didn't skate this hard this season

just to fizzle out
like a boy band fan club.

Now let's hear some noise!

Just get out of my way, katelin.

Not until I hear some noise.

You guys, did you
think the championship game

was actually gonna be easier than
any game we've played this season?

We're tired. So what?

We're sore. So what?

Did kristi yamaguchi win 3 national titles,

2 world championships, and
bring a nation to its feet

when she won a gold medal at the Olympics

just by saying, "let's
just get this over with"?

Yama-who?

Guchi!

Well, she didn't,

and neither are we.

Come on, you guys, we can do this.

This is our moment.

And more importantly,

I did not come here today to lose.

Now let's make kristi proud!

Yeah!

Coach: Go, ladies!
Let's go!

Announcer: Eagles,
breaking out of a zone.

Hollywood passes it to Ronnie.

Eagles move down the ice.

To katelin.

To mojo.

Mojo shoots.


Whoo!
Yeah!

What are you up to, Bradley?

[Bzz, bzz]

There you go!
Dig it out!

Hello?

No, no, it's Spencer.
She's on the ice.

They delayed the program?

Not yet.
But they will.

Just get her here as fast as you can.

Are you sure?
Yeah. No, I'll be there.

Bradley, what are you doing?

I'm getting back on the hockey team.

I know that robot.

Bradley.
Bradley.


Announcer: The eagles
drive down the ice...

Fake left, breaks right...

Eagles shoot, score!

Easy break past the defense.

Hollywood shoots.
Scores!

Yeah!

The eagles are down by 1

with 5 minutes to go in regulation play.

Lookin' good, eagles.
Lookin' good.

Come on.

Come on. Just a tie.
Just a tie.

We can take 'em in overtime.

Stanford, you're in.
Let's go, let's go.

Come on, ladies.
Keep it sharp! Keep it sharp!

Let's go!

Announcer:
Tigers 5, eagles 4.

Katelin's got the breakaway.

Tigers trying to close the gap.

Katelin can't break through.

She goes in...

She's jumping the tiger defense line...

Oh! Katelin
takes a nasty hip check.

The shot goes wide.

Final buzzer sounds,

and the tarrytown tigers
take home the championship.

Way to go, tigers.

You did it!

What?

You made it through the whole season.

I never thought you'd make it.

Way to show 'em how it's done!

We'll get 'em next year.

Yeah.

We're so proud of you!

Katelin!

Katelin, come here!

Come on, hurry up!

What are you doing with that?

I'll explain in the car.
Let's go.

Where?
Walden arena.

There was a delay in the program.

Are you serious?

Your brother called. He
said we can still make it.

Must have money on me.

I don't know,

but we couldn't have done it without him.

Where are you guys going?

Not now, holly.

Oh, no! Oh...

You're a twirl girl!

Oh, no wonder you skate like a girl!

Where are you...

hey, katelin, wait!

Yeah, where you going...
where's she going?

I give up.

This'll take care of it.

[Electronic beeping]

What do we do now?

Go down swinging.


Ahh!

I have some bad news about your outfit.

Somebody trashed it pretty badly.

Pamela.

But I did find the one

that was in that package
on your desk. Is that ok?

It's perfect.

[Organ plays <i>death march]</i>

We will now continue with today's program.

Next up, shelby singer.

[Cheers and applause]

What are you waiting for?

Shelby.

What is wrong with you?

Get out there! This
is your last chance.

No. It isn't.

What are you doing?

Someone told me

there's more to life than figure skating.

I don't know if she's right,

but one way or another, I'm gonna find out.

Oh, no!

Now what?

My other skate.
I can't find it!

Keep lookin'.
I know it was in there.

It must have fallen out back at the rink,

and I never picked up the other skate!

What are you gonna do?

I'll do the routine in my hockey skates.

You can't! Oh...

I take pair from another girl.

Natasha, no!
They wouldn't fit right,

and besides, they wouldn't be mine.

It's impossible!

Not for me! I've been skating
in these things all year.

I know what they can do.

I know what I can do.

Ladies and gentlemen,

katelin kingsford!

My dress.

Cookies?

Easy money.

You're worth every penny, son.

[Classical music starts]

Ha ha ha. No toe pick.

Well, you win some, you lose some.

Katelin!

Come here!

Katelin.

Looks like we're too late.

Don't worry about a thing, sputnik.

They will let you restart.

I will take care of everything.

How?

Sometimes all you can do

is throw bread at the dogs, huh?

I don't think so!

Mojo!

Abracadabra!

Why me? Why me?


I'm afraid the dogs have already been fed.

They will not let you skate.

Attention, please. That
concludes today's competition.

Please stand by for the final results.

It's ok, guys. We'll
get 'em next time.

It's not ok!

Let her skate.

Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

Let her skate! Let her skate!

Let her skate!
Let her skate!

[Talking under chanting]

Ok. All right.

Ok! All right!
All right!

Ladies and gentlemen,

may I have your attention, please?

There's been a correction in the lineup.

Ladies and gentlemen,

miss katelin kingsford.

Whoo!

Announcer: Katelin kingsford.

Out of a possible 6.0,

5.7, 5.8,

6.0, 5.9!

Dork!

Katelin: Poor Pamela.

Oh, well. Some things
never change.

Luckily, I did.

Announcer:
I'm proud to introduce

the U.S. women's
figure skating team...

Alyssa Shane,

Rebecca eggy,

and katelin kingsford!

Ha ha ha!

Yes! Whoo!

Katelin: And even if
Bradley says

he only sacrificed his robot
to win the bet,

I think differently.

I've come to realize

that no matter how embarrassing they are,

I am part of something bigger

than the figure skating community...

A family.
