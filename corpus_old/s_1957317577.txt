Whoa. Whoa!

Huh?

Awesome.
Great use of your chin as a brake, Honey.

Don't eat too much sand.
You'll spoil your dinner.

Look, it's Superman.
Superman!

It's the Man of Steel!

He's going to save us.

Whoo! Superman! Ha ha ha.

Wait, what is he saving us from?
Lunch?

Yeah, it's a pretty nice day.

Ha ha ha. Huh?

Huh?

Bizarro save tiny people
from tentacle creature.

Bizarro no like calamari.

Aah!
My baby!

Oh.
Mommy.

Don't worry. They're just fine.

But this one spit up a little
sand when I caught him.

Thank you, Superman.

You saved my child from your
crazy brother.

Oh, no. No, no, no.

That's not my brother.

It... I mean, he, was created when Lex
Luthor hit me with a duplicator ray...

To make a clone of me he
could control.

Excuse me.

Bizarro, put that down.

Bizarro put down.

Down means up, up means down.

Why does everything have to
be backwards with you?

Bizarro help Superman save
Metropolis from tentacle creature.

Why is it every time you try to help,
Metropolis ends up destroyed?

That octopus isn't a creature.
Oh.

It isn't even an octopus.
It's not dangerous. Huh?

Ha ha ha. Boom.

My car! Do you know how long
it took me to assemble?

There were, like, so many bricks.

Can you take your identical
twin somewhere else?

Twins? Oh, no.

He's actually the opposite of
me in every way.

Ha! Bizarro save Metropolis.

Bizarro save home.

Hey, who's gonna pay for this?

Someone might have
gotten hurt in all of this.

You sure did.
This is ridiculous.

You know, I recently
discovered a place that

needs your help even
more than Metropolis.

Let's not go.

Follow me.

I mean, don't follow me.

Bizarro spy with his little eye,
something start with letter S.

Space.

How Superman know?

Should be around....

Ah! Right there.

Aah! Oh.

Pretty. Ha ha ha.

Ugh!

Ha ha ha. That tickled.

Where you take Bizarro?

Somewhere you can't get into trouble.

This planet's physics
are a little backwards.

Just like you.

It's going to be the perfect home.

Home Metropolis.

How I save Daily Planet?

How I save people here?

Hmm....

Watch this.

The Daily Planet, just like the
one on Earth. What do you think?

Uh....

Ah!

Bizarro, that citizen is in trouble.

Ha!

Ah!

Ha!

You nothing to worry for, Citizen.

Bizarro keep safe.

Aah!

I think I kill him.

I think I kill him. Aah!

No, no, he'll be just fine.

He just needs to rest at home.

Wait, he needs a home.

Can you build him a home, Bizarro?

Uh, Bizarro build.

I'd wish you good luck, Bizarro,
but I know you'd take it the wrong way.

It's Giganta!
Run, run, run!

What is that thing?

Out of my way.

I don't wanna be pulling mini
figs out of my toes.

The Daily Planet news building.

Well, I got news for you.

Print is dead.

This skyscraper is heavier
than you think.

Now Clark Kent doesn't have
to look for a new job.

By the Golden Girdle of Gaea, Giganta,
this is no way for a lady to act.

Or dress.
Animal prints are so last season.

Leopard spots are the new black.

And I'm gonna make you black
and blue.

Get back here.

If you say so.

The perfect distraction
for the perfect plan.

The Justice League will never
figure out what I'm really up to.

Let me take a shot at it,
Gorilla Grodd.

You use your mind control helmet
to turn Giganta, Penguin...

Deathstroke and Captain Cold
into henchmen.

So while Giganta wreaks havoc on
Metropolis, you go after your real prize.

Pretty good guess, and a lot
of words on one breath.

Ugh.
Booyah!

Bats knew you'd try that, so he
had me snatch your hypno helmet.

He's just so smart.

Ugh!

Grodd had us under mind control.

We're stealing for you?

That's cold, Man.

This heist better be for
something good.

Huh?
Aah!

Bananas?

Ha, ha. Bananas?

I like bananas? Ha ha ha.

Nobody makes a monkey out of me.

Let's get out of here.

They're getting away.
Relax, Cyborg. They won't get far.

Hawkman, Operation Crop Duster.

Flash, I need you after
Captain Cold.

I'm on it.

Green Arrow,
see if you have anything

in your quiver to take
down a flightless bird.

Copy that, Dark Knight.

Plastic Man, I need you
to wrap up Deathstroke.

Roger Dodger, Caped Crusader.

Hawkman delivers.

Just my size.

Gotcha.

Stay put, Rookie.

Wish I had a jetpack.

Man, do I have to do
everything around here?

Let me show you how a real
hero does it.

Say hello to my little friend
who's really big, and it's me.

Wow, look, Superman...

Guy Gardner finally made
something as big as his ego.

Say hello to the agony of the feet.

Ow.

Flash to Batman, I'm hot on
the trail of Captain Cold.

Get it? Hot, cold, huh?

I don't like tailgaters.

Hmm.

All right.

Cool off in the icebox.

Ha ha ha.
My favorite time of year: Duck season.

Green Arrow to Batman.

This Penguin is poached.

Plastic Man versus Deathstroke?
That's a stretch.

Whoo! That was close. Aah!

Aah!
Oh.

Plas to Batman, I've got mine
all wrapped up. Hee haw!

Wrapping things up here too.

Superman to Batman.

How's it going with that big gorilla?

Need any help?
I don't need any help from you.

Look, a monkey.

Thanks, Batman.

Hey, now, great takedown.

But, you know, maybe next time, instead
of using children to stop supervillains...

Feel free to call on your friends.

I keep my friends close
and my enemies closer.

I hope not much closer than this.
Hey, you're not implying that...

We caught Gorilla Groddy
And now we're gonna party

Villains going to prison 'Cause
the Justice League is winning

Booyah, yeah

Great work out there, everyone.

Especially our two new recruits:
Cyborg and Guy.

The Man of Steel just said I did great.
Fist bump.

I don't fist bump.

Just glad I was there
to save Wonder Woman.

Was that before or after Giganta
laid you down for a nap, rookie?

Hmm.
Whoa.

When we join forces,
no evil can match us.

That's why we formed the
Justice League.

Together we fight for the liberties of
all living creatures, great and small.

I joined the league to keep an eye
on the most powerful being on Earth.

The hearts and minds of man
are no mystery to me.

But an alien Superman....

Good thing I have my "Just In
Case" box of kryptonite.

I'm okay.
Not sure what came over me there.

Must've eaten some bad
buffalo wings.

Now, where was I? Oh, yes, yes.
Next order of business.

Flash is bored, again.

Any ideas on some new
activities to keep him busy?

Archery.
Ice sculpture.

North American Duck Calls?

Ha, ha.
Huh?

Okay, what now? Ooh. Snack time.

A hero sandwich sounds good.
Let's eat.

Race you.
Birdseed burrito time.

Booyah!

Hmm.
Superman sure left in a big hurry.

Uh oh. Trouble alert.
Great Hera.

There are reports of Superman
attacking LexCorp in Metropolis?

Aha! I knew he would snap one day.

I tried to warn everyone,
but no one would listen.

Uh....

We were just making sandwiches.

Don't think I won't check
that alibi.

I have a pretty good idea
of who's behind this.

Why don't I just take care
of this one solo, Guys?

I don't think so. Let's go.

What a mess.

I'd hate to be the guy
who's responsible for this.

Yeah, really, Guys,
I've totally got this.

And miss all the action? Uh uh.

Oh, look.
Guns, guns, and more guns.

Is this a villain lair?

Oh, it's my first villain lair.
Ha, ha.

It seems Lex has been busy
plotting our demise.

Even Superman's.

Hmm. Mm hm.

All right.

Okay.

Ah.

Hmm.

Lex may be onto something
with this one.

And the directions are very
easy to follow.

Ah, Batman, leave it to you to
dispose of Lex's evil plans for me.

Yeah, that's what I was doing.

Took you long enough.

My lab is practically destroyed.

Lex Luthor.

Do we really have to help this guy?

What's that supposed to mean?

Hello? Villain lair?

You spend all day creating
weapons to destroy us.

Hades himself would spurn you,
you treacherous snake.

How many times have you framed
one of us for a crime...

And then run for president
on a platform to stop us?

That reminds me.

Vote for Lex.

That's going to look great on posters.
Now, stop him.

Bizarro.

Another alien.

Whoa.

Are you twins?

Heh, heh. We are not twins.

Great Scott, the LexCorp
duplicator ray that created you.

You broke in here to steal it?
But why?

Bizarro show you.
Bizarro, don't!

Ugh!

I Batzarro. World's worst detective.

I Greenzarro. And I scared.

I...

Cyzarro.

I Bizarra. Pretty, Pretty Princess.

Bizarro, give me that ray
before you do any more damage.

Nothing stop Bizarro.

Not even Superman.

Can we go? I scared.

Okay. Let's stay.

You heard Bizarro. Stay.

Hmm.

"B-O-M-B."

Boom.

That was weird.

Your twin brother was way out
of line there, Superman.

The universe only needs one Guy Gardner.
If that.

How do we know this wasn't always
part of your secret alien plan?

Because Bizarro can't keep secrets.

He can barely keep his pants up.

But why make duplicates of us?

Duplicates with terrible hair
and unplucked eyebrows?

I don't know, but if one Bizarro
can cause this much destruction...

Think of what an entire
Bizarro League could do.

And I think I know where
they're going.

Bizarro World.

Let's go.

So you want us to follow you
to some distant planet, huh?

Well, I'll play your little
game for now, Alien.

This is just great.

They destroy my lab and Bizarro
takes the kryptonite bomb...

I was going to destroy
Superman with.

Ow.

Merciful Minerva.

Bizarro's planet's a cube?

Figures.

I should warn you,
things here behave a little...

Uh, Bizarro?

Ha! One Green Lantern rescue
rocket coming up.

A chicken?

Why does that not surprise me?

Hey, at least I can still fly,
Wonderless Woman.

Ugh!

Chicken. How degrading.

Yeah, I call that use of power
ring a clear "Foul."

Get it? Fowl? Ha, ha.

This strange planet shows no
evidence of animals or plants.

Well, there's a face plant. Heh.

These rocks are emitting
a weird form of radiation.

Ooh. We should call it
weirdiation, then.

I like that name.

It's this radiation...
I do not know what you are talking about.

Radiation? There are so many kinds.

If only there was a way to
differentiate this particular...

Fine. It's this weirdiation
that created the planet...

And is now interfering with
the team's powers and equipment.

Equipment?
That's what I'm made of.

Oh, there goes my arm.

Hey, why doesn't this place affect you?
Well, not much does, I guess.

So the Kryptonian
has lured us to a planet...

That renders our powers
and weapons useless...

While he remains unaffected.

Well, I have something
that will affect him.

Hmm.

Shh. We're being watched.

What do you want?

I think he wants to know
why you're talking to a rock.

It's a citizen.

A citizen?

I tried to make this place
feel more like home for Bizarro.

But he seems to have taken it
to another level.

It's a wacked out Metropolis.

A Bizarrotropolis.

I like to make up funny names.

I hear something.

I'm going to investigate.

Not without me, you're not.

That looks like fun.

Oh, man.

Beautiful from up here, isn't it?

Oh, and unless you want us both to
fall and become super pancakes...

I'd keep your lead box full
of kryptonite closed tight...

Bruce Wayne. Ha, ha.

I knew you'd use your x-ray vision on me.
But how did you see...

Through my lead lined mask?
I can't.

But I can see that
somebody stitched your

name onto the elastic
band of your underwear.

Alfred.

Oh, come on.

You can trust me with your
secret identity.

I'm Superman.

I don't trust anyone.
Also, you're an invulnerable alien...

Whose motives remain mysterious which
means I should especially not trust you...

Clark Kent.

Hey, how did you know my
secret identity?

I'm Batman.

That's the source of the
sound I heard earlier.

Darkseid.

Must save citizens from big
head machine.

Oh, my doll.

Desaad, who is stealing my rocks?

Why, no one, Master Darkseid.

This is only a minor interference.
I'm taking care of it as we speak.

This heinous host of hideous
heroes seems familiar.

No matter.
Parademons, unleash the drones.

It tickle. It tickle.

They're being tickled?
Tickled to death.

Aah! Superman?

Superman is here?

And Batman.

They have unexpectedly joined forces.

Aah! Oh, they must know our plan.

I didn't say anything, I swear.
I know I can

be a gossip, but they
didn't hear it from me.

Unless my mother said something.

Crush them.

As you wish, My Lord.

Crushing them as we speak.

Crush, crush, crush.

Yes! We've crushed them.

We've squished them.

Squished them into jelly, master.

Ooh, jelly. Maybe I could
spread them on my toast.

Huh?

Where's my jelly?

Huh. Hmm.

Master Darkseid, the jelly...
I mean, the heroes have vanished.

Vaporized. Pulverized.

Atomized. Victimized.

We'll probably never see them again.

Probably. Maybe. Definitely?

Then there are more stones to collect.

Yes.

More stones, more stones,
more stones.

Ugh.
Hmm?

Good thinking. Creating a tunnel
for us to escape into saved us all.

Was that a compliment?

Aah! No. The alien clearly has some sort
of mind control power I'm unaware of.

Must keep my wits about me.

Nice.

You managed to find these
Bizarro knuckleheads on your own.

Man.

Ugh. Why does this planet
keep tripping me up?

You am pretty, like Bizarra.

Ha! She is the spitting image
of you, princess. Ha ha ha.

Hey. Who...?

You make good hiding place
for Greenzarro.

Oh, boy.

Huh? Me am help you. Ha ha ha.

Thanks, I got it.

Now that we've found them, what
are we gonna do with these Bizarros?

We're actually dealing with something
much bigger than Superma...

I mean, Bizarro now.

Darkseid.

Darkseid?

I'm guessing that's a bad thing.

Oh, he's just the most dangerous
force in the universe.

Yipe!

Is that why you stole the Bizarro
Ray and created your own league?

To stop Darkseid?

Bizarro wanted to protect his
citizens from big head machine.

Big head machine
already take many citizens.

You should have come to me
first, Bizarro.

We can help you against Darkseid.

Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

Easy for you to say,
Mr. I've Still Got My Powers.

Are you sure you're not
scared, Guy?

We're talking about rocks, Princess.

Why risk our behinds
for meaningless rocks?

Rocks my only friends
after Superman send me away.

I sent you here because...
Because you embarrassed by Bizarro.

So you hide him.

No, I...

They may just be rocks...

But I suspect Darkseid wants to harvest
their unique properties for a weapon.

Weirdiation.
Why make a weapon out of something...

That messes up everything
it comes in contact with?

Because it messes up everything
it comes in contact with.

Harnessing the power of this weirdiation...

Could render Earth's defenses,
it's heroes, useless.

Just like Guy.

Hey.

If Darkseid's after these rocks...

Then he's headed to the
greatest concentration of them:

Bizarrotropolis.

I have a plan. I'm going to reconstruct
the blocks of these vehicles...

To create a thermodynamic
amplifier of the Bizarro Ray.

When fired at Darkseid's
weirdiation supply, it

will create a new opposite
form of matter...

And the two will annihilate
each other, destroying his ship.

That make no sense.

All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah...

Science, blah, big word."

I have better plan.

First, we take nap.

Yay! Nap.

I think we should go with
Batman's plan.

Thank you for meeting Bizarro
for talk in his special place.

You am excellent listener.

Bizarro not feel helpful to
Justice League.

Bizarro not helpful to anyone.
Ahem.

Huh?

Something bothering you?
On Earth, I bad hero...

on Bizarro world, I bad hero.

All I want is save day like Superman.

Oh. Oh, uh... Ugh.

Sorry.

Uh. Aw.

The Justice League will save
the day, Bizarro. I promise.

No.

Bizarro save day.

Darkseid.

We've got to buy Batman some time.
Let's go.

Ha, ha.
This is gonna make you laugh.

Superman apparently was not crushed
when we were doing all that crushing.

Neither was anyone else.

Please don't hurt me.

I will deal with them myself.

By Athena's gray eyes,
she is a dog of war.

Then why is my guy such a pussycat?

Why can't you be more like her?

Come on. You can do it.

I believe in you. You're a Lantern.

Ha!

Still not working.

No!

That's what I'm talking about.

They better watch out
for Darkseid's Omega Beams.

What are Omega Beams?

Those are Omega Beams.

Got it.

Superman, we meet again.

You know, Darkseid,
my mother used to say:

"Heroes get the cake
and bullies get the rake."

I'm still not entirely sure
what that all meant...

But we'll never let you harness the
power of this planet, you space bully.

I will.

And after Earth falls, the
entire universe will bow to me.

I don't think so.

Oh, the cape. Oh, the face.

I need more time, Superman.

Time?

Time is now purple o'clock.
Heh, heh.

I can break for you.

That's what we're worried about.

Aah.

Go, Cyzarro, break now.

He did it.

He fixed it.

Of course. Only a Bizarro
can make technology work here.

Take this.

Ugh!
And this.

And one of these too.
Ugh.

Uh oh.

Ugh! Not fun.

You're too late, Superman.

I now have enough of this bizarre
energy to rule the galaxy.

Well, on Bizarro World,
rules are meant to be broken.

Bizarro save day.

Bizarro, stop!

A kryptonite bomb.

Thank you.

Desaad, let us test our
weapon on Earth.

Hawkman and hawk jet, inbound.

Deploying hawk swords.

Pressing hawk button.

Hawk shield deployed.

Hawkman, did you intercept the ray?

You could say that.

Hawkman is holding off the ray...

But I suspect even his armor will
eventually fall to the weirdiation.

Bizarro tried to help.

Yeah, you helped, all right.
You helped Darkseid.

Thanks to you, we're done.
Earth is toast.

Without Superman,
we can't stop him.

Yes. Yes, you can.

Darkseid's ship is somehow being
protected from the weirdiation.

But if we overload the ship
with those crazy rocks....

Huh? But that'll just
make his weapon stronger.

So this is how you destroy us all.

You need to trust me, Batman.

Trust you?

Well, if there's one place I can try
trusting you, it's on a backwards world.

No. Those are Bizarro's people.

His friends.

I know, Bizarro,
but you have new friends now.

Huh? Ah.

Heh.
And an old one too.

Superman Bizarro's friend?

Not just friends, Bizarro.

Brothers.
And I should've been a better one to you.

Twin brothers?

Fraternal, but, yes, Twin.

Goodbye. Bizarro miss you.

I miss you.

Especially you with pointy head.

What are they doing?

They're overloading the system.

Goodbye, special place.

We lose. Heh, heh.

Activate the boom tube.

Yes, Sire!

Must keep pressing button.

So hard.

Huh?

Uh....

How attached are Earthlings
to a round moon?

Superman A-okay.

That's great.

He's gonna be all right, then?

No.
Batzarro means we can't save him.

Goodbye, Kal.

Gonna miss you, Pal.

Wish I could've learned more
from you.

Superman live.

Stop with the opposite talk, Man.

No. Superman live.

He's drawing the kryptonite
radiation from his body.

And because he's Bizarro,
it doesn't affect him.

You saved the day, Bizarro.

Bad job.
Terrible work.

You're a loser. Heh.

Thanks.

You had me scared for a second, Buddy.
Scared?

Knew it.

Booyah!
Darkseid on the run and the Earth is safe.

Justice League does it again.

Fist bump.

I'm not wrong often,
but I was about you.

You can be trusted.

Really? Wow.

Then I guess you won't need
that box of kryptonite anymore.

Let's not go crazy.

If we're gonna have a wild
card on the team...

Who can't stop keeping tabs
on me, I'm glad it's you.

Whoa. Look at this place.

Bizarro lost whole world.

Then we're just gonna
have to rebuild it together.

Hmm, great job.

In fact,
the whole place looks wonderful.

I can't wait to walk
through that front door.

Hmm. Front door.

So the heroes managed to
survive Bizarro World. Hooray.

But even the mighty Justice
League cannot hope to survive...

Operation Doom.
