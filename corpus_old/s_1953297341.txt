Hello and welcome to the morning edition
of Locksmith Harry's "Pandora's Box", 

streaming to you live-live-live
on all your favorite devices.

Today we're talking about hackers,
hackivists, and all things' hackerdom. 

Modern-day Robin Hoods,
or cyber-terrorists?

Our first guests, a dynamic
trio of professional hackers 

known simply as BES to their
exclusive clientele and peers, 

they help to make our
cyberworld go 'round.

Welcome to the show.

Thank you Harry.

Yeah, thanks mate,
it's great to be here.

So, where's number three?

Uh, Stat should be
here any minute now.

She's not too good with time, I'm afraid,
but she's excellent at what she does.

And what you all do is,
essentially, get paid to hack.

Uh, we're programmers... 'hacker'
could mean a lot of things.

Yeah, and technically it's
not bad to 'hack' something.  

It's origins come from fixing
something, you know, making it better. 

To create abstractions
that are improvements.

I've read about all these kinds
of color-codes for hackers. 

you got black hats, white hats,
grey hats, blue hats...

Which hat do you guys where?

We're mostly white hats.

With a few other
colors mixed in.

Ah, so you hack bank accounts and
wreak general havoc in your off-time.

Not exactly.

Well Harry, have you checked
your accounts lately?

Right... right.

No seriously, our work is to assist in
protecting your privacy and information 

and to determine points of weakness
within a given construct or system.

oh, so you're the good guys.

You could say that.

With so much of our lives online and so much of our
daily infrastructure running on a network of some kind,

You can argue that the most powerful people
in the world are a bunch of nameless,

faceless folks who are the arbiters
of this age in connectivity.

it's like a hacker-ruling class, and you
guys are making geo-political impact. 

it must be exciting
to realize that.

I try not to think
about it that way.

There are certainly issues that
are being addressed because of it.

But is it addressed properly? for
folks like me, it can be terrifying.

I mean, i don't want private or confidential
information being laundered to the world.

I don't want my personal accounts
compromised, my identity taken.

Most hackers aren't
interested in those things.

But it does happen. You guys
work security mostly.

How do you think this affects
things, say, on a national level, 

with stuff being taken and
weeded out to the global public?

yeah, but the hacker ethos has a passion for
the truth. It wants what's real to be out there. 

there are clear injustices and flaws in
our world that can be peacefully addressed, 

and if hackers can help expose
or fix them, i say why not?

Eva, what's your
take on this?

I believe there shouldn't be censorship,
whether online or in real life. 

but, i'm not a hackivist, I'm a working girl.
I love what I do, but i stay out of politics.

But what if the life you wish to
live is a lie, as so many proclaim. 

What if censorship in all things
becomes prevalent and the norm? 

Would you stand up and
fight against that?

Well, hell yeah. But it
isn't to that point yet...

And what about number three?

who, Stat? As long as her iPhone is working and
she's connected somewhere, she's a happy camper.

And yourself?

Well, I believe we take a lot of
what we have today for granted. 

We expect food to be cheap and available
everywhere; have unlimited drinking water,

electricity at our fingertips, our cars to
run, our highways to be in good condition, 

our Internet to function fast and without a hitch.
What happens if all that just stops working?

well, I wouldn't be
broadcasting this show...

aye, you'd be out looking for food
and water and trying to make a fire.

woah nelly, let's hope it doesn't come
to that folks, because i would suck at it.

Most people probably would, Harry.
Most people probably would...

Is that blood?

Hello... Earth to Jesse.

Is that fucking
blood on your hands?

It's not my blood.

I guess the other guy
is all beat-up to shit -

That's what you're gonna say?

Who said it was a guy?

You're so full of shit.

Check out my latest post. 

Isn't that the
coolest thing ev-er?

What is that anyway?

It's a wake up call.

Oh, I hate wake-up calls...

You'll like this one.

Ow... that hurt... 

Stop it. Jesse.  

What the fuck?

What the fuck, Stat... what
the hell happened to you?

Hey...

Holy shit girl, are you okay?

Stat is on-time?
Must be Armaggeddon.

Hey, where were you anyway?

I'm... not sure
what happened.

Do you know who
did this to you?

No clue.

Do you know who we are?

I'm Eva and this is Bren...

We work together. Do you
remember what you do?

Logging in here was... easy. 

This place looks familiar.

That's your flat, dear.

It's pretty fucked up...

Shouldn't we be calling the
police, an ambulance perhaps?

Yeah, we need to
get you looked at.

Can either of
you explain this?

It's started...

Can you move it a
bit to the right?

What's started?

Actually, the other way...

What is it?

It's fucking glued to
my hand, you guys... 

What the Hell is going on?

I'm coming to you. now.

You're taking a flight?

I'm at a friend's, so
i'm like an hour away.

You hold tight, sister.

Is this the friend with benefits
or the friend with problems?

None of your
fucking business.

What the fuck is it?

It's a bit
complicated to explain.

Give me the Twitter version.

Won't fit in 140 characters,

Darlin'. it needs
a pdf manual.

Do you remember how to code?

Wouldn't that be ironic
if she couldn't...

This isn't fucking funny.

Irony and funny may
have moments of inclusion, 

but they aren't
exactly synonymous.

I don't know who i am.

Grim.

Stay calm. Stay put. I'll
be there in an hour, max.  

Bren, can you do anything
about it from remote?

I can do almost anything from

remote given the
time, but... that?

He put it on a
bloody phone and

glued it to her bloody hand.

WHO did?

We'll get to that...

Eva, you reckon it's
safe if she hangs about?

Do you remember anything?

bits... my head's killing me.

Do you know your name?

Stat... Stacey.

Stacey. Yeah, you
hate that name.

You were always Stat to us. 

I don't think, considering
the circumstances,

There is a better option
for her to go to, alone.

Hm.

Besides, i doubt
he'll be back.

It's obviously
happening already.

Who?

How would you describe him?

How about a fucking name?

Jesse. His name is Jesse.
Ring any bells?

I think I...

Well, he certainly has
that effect  on people.

Jesse...

Pardon me? 

It’s the name you mentioned.

Right. Do you know this...
Jesse?

I know of him.

How well do you know him?

I never met him, but he's a bit
of a rock star in certain circles. 

I know some of his work.

And you think
this is his doing?

Security for WestDat?
Seriously?

Why you waste your talent and time
with those people is beyond me.

They're off your map,
what do you care?

They pay well. 

I can see the attraction.

Do you know that coffee is harvested
with two different kinds of bean? 

You have the ripe red bean,
which is less acidic; 

and the unripened green bean,
which is used in lesser brands.

The best way to harvest coffee
to this day is to do it by hand. 

For selection. It's
very labor intensive.

And the point is?

To have coffee abundant on every
street corner in the world,

you have a massive chain of industry
with the plebs of labor at the bottom. 

How much of what we pay here
do you think goes to them?

don't you see the pattern? the
weight between demand and sharing?

It's like a cheap DDoS. 

All it can lead to is
implosion and collapse.

Ever study the fall of Rome?

What's up. you didn't call me here
to talk about history or coffee...

We're recruiting.

Not interested.

Still trying to create change? To make
cyberspace a more safer, civil place?

Are you still trying to free information from the
shackles of the material by fucking it all up?

Open your eyes. Look where you
stand. You might be surprised.

And you obviously
know where you stand.

You've always been a
cheerleader for transparency, 

But you never think
about the cost.

The world doesn't need
transparency or change.

It's broken, and all you keep doing
is moving the same shit around. 

You could be writing history.

What ever happened to the idea that
you don't own your abstractions?

Who ever said anything
about ownership?

You stamp it on
everything you do.

You misunderstand me.

I doubt that.

How's that working for you?

How's what working for me?

Being cock-sure.

Great, you?

You can't tell me you don't
see the rot in all this. 

No one would
knowingly choose this. 

The world needs
a hard reboot.

d'you practice this shit
in front of the mirror? 

Every line that comes out of
your mouth is like your code. 

It's a lead into
a sucker punch.

That is why you fail.

Because i think you're like a bad
'come to jesus' bumper sticker?

That you see humor
in any of this. 

Look in the mirror.

You're no better than those fat lemmings
sipping on their mocha frappacinos,

clogging the net with
their mundane drivel, 

oblivious to their
enslaved existence,

believing that people actually give a
fuck about what they're doing at any

given moment as they happily
hand over their lives.

and you're like a
bad post in Phrack.

Since when do you give a shit about
what people do with their lives?

Payback is imminent.
Lines will be drawn.

you'll want to be on
the right side when it does.

I'll keep that in mind.

Call the police, now!

You okay?

I’m very sorry to say this,
but after you talk to the police,

I don’t want you
back here again.

This is a serious
allegation you’re making

I made no allegation. I just asked who did
your last security work. It's all there.

We'll have our it people
look into this immediately.

You do that.

Say, I got some time after
this. Wanna get a drink?

I'll send the
invoice to accounts.

Getting a lead into this stream
is proving a bit difficult. 

You're in the best position to do so,
i'm afraid. or eva, whenever she gets there.

I need to get this
thing off my hand...

You have to
appreciate the irony.

What if I just turn it off?

Yeah, look... though the actual event resides
somewhere else, let's hold that thought, alright?

Today, you're about to
be a part of history.

Today, you're not going to tweet, post, or
say anything mundane or ridiculously trivial. 

Today, the  world
is going to wake up

and hear your words.

Well, not your words. 

But you'll be my herald.

Today's the day that
you get your wish: 

to be famous, 

and remembered.

I remember bits
about this guy Jesse.

My condolences.

He's psycho.

He's definitely a character.

Are you on the
fanboy forums?

Hardly. An odd fascination
more than anything. 

He knows his shit,
no one can argue that. 

His great grandfather
was part of the Choctaw

code talkers in your Army's 36th
Infantry Division, World War One.

He's relentless, a nutter, and definitely
two sandwiches short of a picnic;

but he's been a voice for a
lot of angry people for years.

You and Eva never got along
with him. I keep my distance.

Eva seemed like she
knew what this was.

Let's just say Eva has had more
dealings with Jesse than either of us; 

a rather unenviable position.

I wouldn't do anything with
that phone if I were you...

someone just text'd me.

yeah well, don't reply.

Too late.

Are you daft?

What if it's him?

Then you've just let him
know that's you're lucid,

That you're okay.

I think he wants me to be.

After beating you within
a sliver of your life?

First, we don't
know who did this.

I know it was Jesse who busted my
nose, but that was another time.

Oh fuck...

What?

Shit.

We just lost four hours.

How?

He's fucking with me.

Eva thinks it's Jesse from something
she's glimpsed in the stream.

Could it be anyone else?

I don't know... I mean,
this can't all be for me. 

This part, the phone, is for me,
but what's happening on the phone...

Well, he knows you code, otherwise why
put it there? it's like he's showing off...

It's like a dare.

It certainly fits Jesse's M.O.

You really should
get to a hospital.

I'll live.

People have died from less. 

You could have a concussion, internal
bleeding, brain hemorrhaging-

Bren...

or any of the above.

I'll get to a hospital once we figure this
out and get this fucking phone off my hand.

Yeah, well maybe a hospital would
get the phone off your hand.

Focus, Bren.

I thought it was rather
a bright idea myself. 

d'you got any acetone?

I don't remember if i
have acetone in the house; 

and even if I do, how am I
supposed to find it in this mess?

How about margarine?

Says here margarine works.

Or... you could use soap and water
to soften it against your skin,

though water and phones
usually don't mix very well.

Stat continues to look
around her desk for something.

Well, at least you
haven't lost that.

Apparently. 

It crossed my mind, but you don't think
this is some kind of a bomb do you?

What, you mean the
kind that goes boom?

Is there another kind?

Yeah, the kind that goes boom.

Look, anything's possible,
but Jesse resides in another place.

He's ambitious
beyond measure.

Bombs, they're dirty...
not elegant.

If you ask me, he's playing
something on a much grander scale.

It's a long string. i'll let
you know if i've hit the loop yet.

Get out of the fucking way!

Are you kidding me?? what?

Eva just called,
said she's almost there.

Great. 

Figures he'd glue the
fucking phone to my right hand.

I got the source links,
but it's to hell and back.

Okay, just give me a sec...

How's the head?

Numb. Cold. 

I just remembered something...

Oh?

I have a gun.

The point is?

It's getting down
to the wire.

Who knows what's going
to happen at zero.

Look, if it's locked away somewhere,
why not just leave it there? 

Typical.
Bloody cowboys, all of ya.

Look, the gun isn't going
to solve this problem.

I don't think when
the clock gets to zero,

a zombie is going to pop
out of your closet at ya.

Besides, you said you're
right-handed, right?

It's not much use trying to
fire a weapon in your off-hand.

Jesus, you sound
like my mother.

I'm ambidextrous with a few
things and, it still shoots.

Not funny.

What if I stick this line with a false go-to,
hook it, plant the variable here, and...

Ha. Brilliant. Could work.

Could set it off again...

Yeah, well...
it could do that.

You think Eva will
be here in less than... 

Twenty minutes?

Not sure. Let me call her.

Hello.
Yeah, how far are you? 

We may have a break
on the strings.

Well, it's a bit
tighter than that.

Stat will explain
when you get there.

She said that she's ten minutes
away, and not to do anything rash.

Rash?

I'm paraphrasing.

Gonna do it.

If you give me a bit more time,

I could figure out
what is at stake here.

Time is not exactly on our side.

Just give me ten minutes.

Stopping the sequence is priority
right now, whatever's at stake.

I'll take that as agreement.

Fuck me...

What, it worked?

It worked.

That calls for a drink.

I need a smoke.

You don't smoke.

Nice try.

Listen, shouldn't
you just stay put?

I need some fresh air.

Okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

I'll just be out
around the corner.

Cheers. i'll let eva in when she
gets here, tell her you're outside.

Breathing.

Tell her there's
beer in the fridge.

Oh so she gets a beer for
driving over, and I get nothing?

How about a night of rounds at that watering
hole under the tracks you like so much?

You're back.

How's the nose?

Sorry for the mess, 

the boys had it  in their minds that
you had something on the operation. 

you had some really neat stuff.

Fix it now, bitch.
Fix it!

It's clever. but all you're doing
is delaying the inevitable.

Glad to inconvenience you.

He's a spineless shit. 

Couldn't  even do it himself.

Enough.

Stat...

Stop, or she dies. 

Not another step.

How long were you in on this, Bren?

As long as it made sense.
When did you figure it out?

What the fuck?

Hard to ignore your
comments in the code.

You wanted me to know.

Okay, everyone just chill. 

All of this drama
isn't necessary.

And Jesse, for god's sake,
put the bloody gun down!

Stat. You will see the virtue
in all this once it's done.

And the World will realize
everything they took for granted.

From the ashes of discontent and
enslavement, true freedom shall rise.

Jesse, have you gone mental?

Get with the bloody program.

Put the gun down, now.

Your ass is next.

I never keep it loaded...

... thank god you're okay.

You can't stop it. 

It all ends and begins. 

now.
