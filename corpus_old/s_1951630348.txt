Sit down, dear

This one is Swiss by nationality

Two years employment here in London
as a governess

Pian. Drawing.

French, of course

How old are you, dear?

Twentytwo

Are you in good health?

Yes

Are you parents still living?

My mother is dead

What was the cause of death?

She died in childbirth

Ask her to stand up

Stand up, dear

Turn around

All the way

Ask her what the money is for

The father is in debt, it seems.

Does she have any other way of making money?

Sit down, dear.

The gentleman asks

Have you no other way to raise money?

Does the gentleman have a suggestion?

Your're very pretty. You could marry

I could sell mylife for life

The gentleman's needs,
I believe, are of shorter duration

Has she done this before?

The gentleman asks...

Can the gentleman not ask himself?

Your're not to know who he is, my dear

No one is

He need not tell me his name

I'd like to hear his voice

What can you tell from a voice?

A little

Have you ever done anything like this before?

No, never

Will you do it?

Of course

Why else am I here?

Shall I look further?

No, this is the one

Anything else, sir?

I did't want to be seen
entering the room with you

I can't introduce myself, as you know

Did you have a smooth crossing?

For the most part

Do you like the hotel?

I have no complaints

Please

It is of utmost importance

that we're not seen together in public

I have a reputation to protect

Not just for myself, but for others

Do you understand?

We'll meet each evening
after dinner in your room

As you wish

Are we to...

To meet this evening?

Yes. We only have three evenings

When are we to begin?

I thought you might
need time to accustom yourself

I have accustomed myself

I'm ready now

The fire gives more light than one expects

Does it bother you?

No

Will this do?

Yes

You may think I'm no better than him

I think nothing

Is what we're doing wrong?

You, at least...

Are doing it for someone else

I, too, have a duty to someone else

Then, sir, since neither of us are here
for our own pleasure

Perhaps what we do isn't so wrong

I don't want to know your name

Or anything about you

Aren't you afraid to be seen with me?

There's no one to see

I like it here

Just sea and sky and...

And nothing

I like it

Makes me want to shout

Then shout

It's not son easy

Your're very...

I don't expect it to be like this

What did you expect?

Last night...

...I thought...

For a moment I thought that...

You thought I like it?

Did you?

No

But I could

I wish...

What do you wish?

I wish I could shout

Mrs. Jago will see to everything
when the time comes

Yes, I know

We made an arrangement. I accept it

You won't want to be seen
disembarking in my company

No

Goodbye, then

Very soon, my dear

It's a girl

Is she all there?

Oh, yes. She's beautiful

Better take her away at once

There, my pet. All over now

For my English Daughter

First birthday, darling

August 10th, 1839

I don't even know your name

Another New Year my Darling

I don't forget, wherever you are

Your Fourth Birthday. You must be so big

Six years today. When will I ever find you?

Happy birthday, darling

I don't forget you

Ready?

Madames, give me your bodies, give me your souls

Make a window with your legs

Move from the waist

Ladies, trust your gentleman

In the polka, faith is the virtue that saves

Shame on you, Mr. Godwin. Not dancing?

I'm afraid I don't know the steps, Mrs. Hurst

None of us know the steps

that's the fun of it we learn together.

As you seem

I'm also not dressed for dancing

Jenny, I want you

I shall have you

Seen enough?

You must admit, it's quite a sight

Quite a cost, too

There's the monster

Do you want to meet him?

Surely

The lady with him isn't exactly his wife

You don't exactly surprise me

The latest in long line

Father,

This is I'd like to introduce you to

You're not dressed, Charles. Go get dressed

Father

You're a blot, boy

Father, may I introduce you

To Mr. John Taylor of Ohio

My father, Lord Clare

Miss Holland

What brings you all the way from Ohio, sir?

Your son and I hope to do business together

What business?

I'm a sheep farmer

A sheep farmer

Get dressed, Charles, or get out

Be a good fellow

I wouldn't have missed that for the world

I wish I could laugh

My father's London life must be paid for

We don't live like this in the country

The boy's not normal

Don't ask me why

Don't be hard on him, Jimmy

When you think of his poor wife

Damn it, Molly, that was 10 years ago

You'd think he'd find female comfort

But he won't

Are you sure?

Quite. The boy's not normal

I brought his fellow over from Paris

First polka in London

Come on, Molly. Let's hop

You'd be the new govemess

Do you know about the child, miss?

I know what I've been told

She was left in a basket
on the steps of the Ram Inn

They tell you that?

No

No, they don't tell them that

Could you possibly put something on the fire?

I can't bend, miss

My wig falls off

Please to come with me, miss

You'll be the fourth this year

The fourth govemess?

The don't stay

Miss Louisa sees to that

Louisa

Govemess's rrom

Thomas will bring your trunk up,
when he has time

Twentyfive pounds a year you're paid

Cook gets thirty

Schoolroom's this way

We don't get many like you here

Like what?

Foreigners, miss

We're all English here

Schoolroom

Know about Miss Louisa, miss?

She was left in a basket at the Ram Inn

Don't beliebve it

The master bought her froma gypsy

She thinks she's the little lady,

But she don't fool me

Where is she now?

I don't know

Maybe the gypsies took her back

Excuse me

Where would I find Miss Louisa?

She'll be in her lake house

She always hides there

Who are you?

Miss Laurier. Your new govemess

You're not English, are you?

Do you speak English?

Then bugger away, lady

I see you found your way to Lquisa's lake house

And she ran away from you, I suppose

That's what she does

I'm afraid her father

Isn't very strict with her, as you'll discover

Mr. Godwin is not at home?

He's in town

We expect him back tomorrow

Mrs. Godwin

Oh, no

No, I'm not Mrs. Godwin

My sister, Amelia, married Charles

So she is Mrs. Godwin

Soon after her marriage

She had a serious accident, a riding accident

Charles had no one to run the house

So I came.

And, um, Mrs. Godwin

Amy didn't dei

Her life is over, but she lives on

And here we are

Charles and I...

...and Amy and Louisa

We're home

There was no need to walk down, John

I'm not an old man yet

Ellen, take Louisa's cloak

This is the man you must meet

Mr Ames is my farm manager

Have any experience of Southdowns

No. We run Merinos

There's no hardier breed than the Southdowns

We have a new govemess

Another one?

Send Miss Laurier to meet the master

Thomas, come with me

Look at this girl

Is she so frightening?

Govemesses run from her, squealing

How do you do that, Louisa?

I don't want a govemess

I don't want a govemess

Did you miss me?

You must give me breeding tips

I mean to win prizes

Mr Godwin's your man

He's our master breeder

Be careful, John

Breeding can become something of an obession

It's nothing less than
the endless pursuit of perfection

How close have you gotten?

To perfection, I mean

The Selcombe flock
is as good as you'll find, sir

That's what I hear

What is your secret?

Here's the new govemess

This is my brotherinlaw, Mr. Godwin

Miss Laurier

Miss Laurier's from Switzerland

...but she'w worked in England for years

I see

I'm sure Mr. Taylor needs a drink

I know I do

You must leave at once

What on earth possessed you to come here?

It took 7 years to find my child

Don't make me leave here now

We had an agreement

You had your money

I didn't know how hard it woule be

I never forgot her cry

You were paid to forget

I tried

You tried?

I'd return the money if I could

I don't want the money

It wasn't for me

It was for my father

He was in prison

I don't want to hear this

I just...

I wanted an heir, a child

Is that so wrong?

I swear no one will learn the truth

Not even Louisa

Not your own daughter?

You couldn't live with that

I have no choice

I have no home

I must be govemess to her or nothing

She hates govemesses

She needs me. That's enough

No, it's impossible, the whole thing

You must go. That's it

You must get another govemess

Miss Laurier can't stay

Why?

Louisa doesn't like her

Oh, Charles. Louisa doesn't like any govemess

Can't a men choose who educates his daughter?

Shall she be dismissed without a character?

No

Then she must be given a month's notice

A month?

Can't she just be paid?

Govemess make their homes with employers

She can't leave without a new situation

A month?

A month is an eternity

Does she really have no home but this?

That why govemesses are govemesses

What happens to them
when they can't be govemesses

I really don't know

These huge rooms

And we live within 3 feet of the fire

Come with me, please

Your're to have one month's notice

You swore you'd tell no one

Thank you, Hannah

Have I time for tea, sir?

Yes. I'll stay you return

Amy, I've brought someone to see you

This is Miss Laurier

Please

This is my wife, Amelia

Mrs. Godwin

I tell Amy everything

She knows Louisa is my daughter

But I promised her
I'd never shame her before the world

No one else knows but you

Does she understand us?

I choose to believe she does

If there's any pity
in you for my wife's wasted life...

...swear you'll keep out secret

I swear

Now leave us

Good morning, Louisa

Do you know your ABC?

Do you know your ABC?

This is L...

...for Louisa

This is L for Louisa

Don't go. We have work to do

Don't go. We have work to do

You're poor, I suppose?

Yes

I don't have to do what you say

You hoist them off

Bugger away, lady

Gently

You see why?

No, I don't

They all look good to me

You have a superb flock

I do

I've breeding imperfections out for 15 years

This one is a perfect breeding ewe

Chine runs straight from the nect to the tail

Good, wide hips

Straight forelegs

Plenty of woolbetween the ears

Look in her eyes

A sweet, gentle disposition

She'll feed well, fatten well and lamb well

Good morning, Miss Laurier

Mr. Taylor

Have you come to admire the Southdowns, too?

No, sir. I've come for Mr. Godwin's instructions

Well?

Am I to teach Miss Louisa,
if only for one month?

Yes

Then I must keep her in the schoolroom

What forms of discipline may I use?

None

What should she endure lessons
she does not like?

She'll learn soon enough how hard the world is

For these few short years,
I want her to be happy

Is that clear?

Yes sir

Fair enough?

Turn around. Go on

Let me out! I want Papa! Let me out!

Somebody let me out

I want Papa! I want Papa!

Let me out! Now!

I want Papa

Let me out!

After you've done your lessons

Let me out!

I want Papa! Let me out now!

Hey! Let me out!

What is that?

Miss Louisa, sir. Being educated

I hate you!

No, never! Never!

Open the door

Miss Laurier, open this door at once!

What is this? Open the door

No, sir

Please, Papa! come in, please

I won't have you treat here like this

She'll grow up ignorant and friendless

She's imprisioned!

She only cares for you

So no one cares for her

Give me the key

She's unhappy and lonely

She doesn't know who she is

Papa, help me! Papa, I want you

I can help her. I know I can

But she must learn to obey me

If you harm even one hair on her head

Do you think I, of all people, would hurt her?

I'll make you a promise

Whatever I do to Louisa, I'll do to myself

You want her to love you

I want her to be loved

She won't have you forever

Louisa, I'll see you when lessons are over

All right, darling?

I love you

Lunch, miss

Thank you, Ellen. Put it on the table

Will that be all, miss?

Thank you, Ellen

Do you want your lunch?

One

Two

If you won't eat, then neither will I

I say you're lucky to have her

Why?

She has pride in herself. Doesn't back down

And she's lovely

You must have noticed

Miss Laurier is here to teach Louisa

She leaves in a month

Then I may speak to her?

What do you mean, "speak to her"?

Well, she doesn't seem to have a home of her own

You mean to employ her?

Not exactly

I was thinking of marriage

Marriage?

I could do a lot worse

I leave tomorrow

I don't have much time

Youd'd better ask her, then

I'm cold

So am I

I hate you

Hate me if you want, but you must obey me

I won't. I'd die first

How will you die?

I'll drown myself in the lake

How will your body stay underwater?

It just will

No, it won't. Bodies float

You could put stones in your pockets

Don't talk to me

Or you could fill a bag with pebbles

I said, don't talk to me

What do you do in the lake house?

If you come near it, I'll murder you

How?

I'll stab you in the heart with a knife

That would do it

It would. You'd be dead

You'd have to bury me

No. I'd just leave you

I'd rot. I'd smell

Serves you right

What are these stupid lessons, anyway?

"Louisa...

"...Ioves...

"...Papa."

"Louisa...

"...Ioves...

"...grass."

"Louisa...

...eats

...grass

Sheep eat grass

Papa loves sheep

You see? It's not that hard

Do you know about firelight?

What about it?

It's a kind of magic

Firelight makes time stand still

When you put out the lamps

And sit in the firelight's glow...

...there aren't any rules anymore

Your can do what you want

Say what you want

Be what you want

And when the lamps are lit again

Time starts again

And everything you said or did forgotten

More than forgotten

It never happened

I can do what I want?

I want to go

Then go

It's been unlocked since lunchtime

All right?

To a famous vitory

Don't say that

Louisa's too young to be defeated

Then we shall drink to you

To Miss Laurier

Govemesses have tried
to control Louisa and failed

Only Miss Laurier realized
she must first control Charles

But look at him

He's not at all grateful

I understand you're leaving in month

Where do you go?

To another situation

Then what?

I don't understand

Years pass

You're no longer required. Then what?

Do you return to Switzerland?

I can't see into the future

Some say the future is what you make it

In America, certainly

In America. That's what I mean

In America

Good night, darling

We've begun now

Your asked to see me?

Yes

I wanted a moment alone with you before I go

Please. Have a seat

Miss Laurier...

...I won't waste your time

I'm a single man

With 5,000 acres to my name

If you would consider a life in America

I would be proud to take you there

As my wife

You pay me a very great compliment, sir

But the answer is no

I'm afraid so

You don't know till you ask

You're not too disappointed, I think

I hardly know you

So I won't act as
if I can't live without you, but...

A man can get his hopes up
pretty high pretty quick

I'm sorry

Just so I know...

I'll be doing this again one of these days

Is there anything I can fix?

Like my dress...

...how I talk?

No, Mr. Taylor

Any lady would be fortunate to be courted by you

Any lady but you

Louisa, darling, please

You promised me

Louisa, I can't bear this

That's why she does it

Damnation! Can't I feel for my own child

Feel for her, but don't pity her

Louisa, let go

Please

Go, then. If you want to go, go

Will you all right, darling?

You don't care, so what does it matter?

Now it's just you and me

Shall we start our lessons?

I don't have to obey you

You're just servant

That's enough! Be silent

You will obey me, whether you want to or not...

...because, poor as I am

I am in authority over you

You will not speak disrespectfully

Or raise your voice to me

Servant. Servant. Servant

Servant. Servant. Servant

Servant. Servant

Servant. Servant. Servant. Servant

I'm a prisoner, not a servant

So will you be when you grow up

The day you come of age

The gates wil close around you
because you are a woman

If you marry

What you own becomes your husband's property

If you don't marry,
every profession will be closed to you but one

And that one is a life of
loneliness and humiliation

That lock you up, Louisa

But there's one door they can't lock

They can't imprison your mind

That's why I want you to learn to read

I want you to have your own life

Write and tell me when Southdowns win prizes

Come and see for yourself

Maybe I will

Best grazing anywhere

Twenty dollars an acere

Think about it

You find time for the other business

She turned me down

She turned you down?

I guess there's someone else

Lucky fellow, is all I can say

Goodbye, Charles

Don't go

Constance will be down shortly

As you wish

Taylor told me he made you an offer

And you refused him

Yes

For Louisa's sake, I presume

Yes

The fire gives more light than one expects

No lamps lit?

What is Jane thinking of?

I don't know how much you want to know

I remember...

...the firelight

I remember...

...too much

"Tree"

"Eye"

"See"

"Pig"

"Dig"

"Wig" This is stupid

"Bad"

"Sad"

"Happy"

I suppose it's "glad"

"Mad"

When I was young, I had no mother

She died just after I was born

I loved my father very much

But what I wanted most was a mother

The sick lady's not my real mother

Yes, I know

My real mother's not sick

Where is she?

It's a secret

Do you ever see her?

Of course. Every day

What do you do with her?

Just be with her

Miss Laurier?

"See"?

How do you know
she's not just reading the picture

She is

Then it's not reading

No, it's only pretending

But after a while,
the pretnese becomes the reality

I see

Louisa tells me
you have a story asbout firelight

I tell her firelight is a magic time

When time stands still

Why do you tell her that?

I find it helps

A time with no rules, at the end of the day

I must ask you to help me

How?

There was a time, a short time

When we were close,

You and I

Do your remember it?

Oh yes

Tell me that
time is over and can neveer come again

You don't answer

What happens when time stands still?

In the firelight...

...you can do what you want

Say what you want

Be what you want

When the lamps are lit again

Time starts again, but...

...everything you said or did is forgotten

More than forgotten

It never happened

God, I hate the country

It's so damn cold

Into the mausoleum

Hello, Connie

Terrible journey

The roads get worse every year

Who are all these people?

Fiddlers

You!

More coal on the fire before I freeze to death

Come on in, Manzini

Herd your fellows in

One can't have a dance without music, Connie

Fire!

Can't bend, me lord

My wig falls off

Yes, here I am. Hello there, little missy

Who are these people?

Christmas cheer

What is it about this house?

The moment I walk in, I want to kill myself

Damn it, don't preach at me

I have to sell one of the farms

Never sell land

The one sensible thing my father told me

Why borrow money
if all you mean is to give it back

Where's Molly?

Are there any more debts?

How do I know? I just live my life

All for the sake of a few years of pleasure

Pleasure is all there is
between us and the grave

Hello, who are you?

This is Miss Laurier

This is my father, Lord Clare

Miss Laurier is Louisa's govemess

Never had a govemess like you

Are you French?

No, I'm from Switzerland

Sacrifice your life if you want, Charles

I'm enjoying mine

Miss Laurier, is it?

Do you polka?

Well done, Charles. She's lovely

Your Swiss govemess

Yes, she's an excellent teacher

I'm glad to hear it

Connie

What about a quick turn around the room?

Why not?

Poor lambkin, are you all right?

Of course I am

I'm so sorry

I'll see to him, Miss Laurier

I'm fine. I want to dance

Why didn't you say?

I never thought I'd get you on a dance floor

There's a first time for everything

You sent for me, sir?

Well, are you or aren't you?

Am I what?

Didding Charles?

Molly says you are

And she can usually spot these things

You judge everyone by yourself, sir?

At least you know what I mean

You're not going to swoon, are you?

No

Are you're wrong, missy

I don't judge everyone by myself

Least of all Charles

I know he's not like me

Because he's like my father

The old bastard never thought much of me

Duty this, duty that

And now Charles

Hard to have you son act like your father

He must have been a child once

Of course he was a child once

Ah, you're right

When he was a little fellow. I'd forgotten that

When Charles was just sixteen, he said to me

"Father, I can't respect a man
who lives only for pleasure

You know what I replied?

"You've no right to speak to me like that

Until you've gotten well and truly fucked"

Well...

...now he has

Good for you, missy

Good for you

And you'r right, of course

He's my boy

She pretends her mother is there

I know. We're all pretending

When you come into a room

I pretend I haven't noticed you

Then I look...

...and there's nothing in the world but you

Sometimes I think

Why don't we just go away?

You, me, Louisa

Would you come with me?

Why ask?

It's only pretending

You can't leave

I don't think I can bear it

You have a duty to your estate, your familiy

Your wife

How can you be so calm?

Not calm

Stay with me tonight

All right

Louisa

Come back! It's not safe!

Louisa, don't leave me!

Sleep, darling. Sleep

I'll never leave you

Never

They're making a imventory

Charles left for town at first light

Mr. Dodds says the estate is to be sold

What will become of us all?

Who knows?

Maybe it's for the best

Sometimes this house feels like a prison

Mr. Godwin loves it very much

He did once

But this house died the day Amy didn't die

I wish she had died

Does that shock you?

No

There's a law, of course...

...that forbids a man
from marrying his dead wife's sister

But it's an absurd law, easily evaded

If Mrs. Godwin were to die

You and Mr. Godwin would marry

I don't pretend he loves me as he loved Amy

But ten years is a long time

We've grown older together

There's a kind of closeness in that

"Fire"

"God"

"Hat"

What's the word?

"Hat"

How do you know?

Because of the picture

How do I know?

Charles, you're back?

Will everything be all right?

No. Nothing will be all right

Are there so very many debts?

Yes

Yes and damage is well and truly done

The estate will have to go

Oh, Charles

I'm so sorry

It's not right. Something should be done

No, it's not right

But nothing will be done

What will become of us?

Who knows?

It's a cold night, Amy

Bitter cold

I've often thought this is a prison for you

That if you could speak...

...you'd ask me to...

You'd ask me to let you go

But I have to know that you want it

Show me what yo want, Amy

Show me what you want

Lord, from You we come

To You we must return

Take my beloved wife

Sometime in the night, I'd say

It was a very cold night

I understand the fire had gone out

That was unfortunate

It wasn't me, sir

I'll swear on the good book

Nobody's blaming you, Hannah

It's been ten years

At least now she's at peace

Indeed

Indeed

I think we should leave

You haven't eaten

No, I...

Are you all right?

Yes, I think so

I loved Amy dearly

But I know...

...this is for the best

You really believe that?

Yes, I do

Dear Connie...

...you've been good to me all these years

And you've been good to me

So much is changing

What's to become of us all?

As you friend Mr. Taylor said...

...the future's what we make it

I'm sorry

No, don't speak

I...

It was a mistake, that's all

I'm sorry to have disturbed you

Connie

Yes, Charles?

You know how much I loved her

Yes, Charles I do

Behold, I show you a mystery

We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed...

...in a moment

In the twinkling of an eye...

...at the last trump

For the trumpets shall sound...

...and the dead shall be raised incorruptible...

...and we shall be chanted

For corruptible must put on incorruption

And this mortal... must put on immmortality

So when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption shall be borught to pass the saying

That it is written
death is swallowed up in victory

Oh, death, where is thy sting?

Oh, grave, where is thy victory?

Does he love you?

Yes

Do you love him?

Yes

I would have made him happy

Love him for me, too

Was it you?

Yes

I think it's what she wanted

But I'll never know

I must live with that

As must I

You've done nothing

Nothing?

I've wnated you and Louisa...

...with all my mind and heart and will

For seven long years

My desire has destroyed everything
that stood in its way

Your wife...

...your home, your world

I never knew there was such power in desire

And if it were so?

Are you sorry?

No

Then we deserve each other

May God have mercy on us

For my English Daughter

Why did you give me away?

I didn't

I sold you

How much for?

Five hundred pounds

Is that a lot?

It's a fortune

I'm glad it was a lot

Mama

Mama

My darling

My baby

Mama

Mama
