<I>Young Man, In The Future,
Please Deposit The Paper

<I>Inside Its Designated
Target Area.

No Problem, Lady. Whatever.

Lady?

<I>I Will Be Monitoring Your
Accuracy From Now On.

Whoa!

<I>Morning Paper.

Oh, Miles!

I Love The Amount Of Publicity We've Been Getting.

Look At That! Look At That!

Isn't That Fabulous?

I Think It's Because That Reporter Has A Crush On You.

You Think Everybody's
Got A Crush On Me.

That's Because
Most Men Do.

You're Just Too
Blind To See It.

Not Blind, Just
Very Busy.

Self-Inflicted.

You Have Heard Of The Book,
"Smart Women, Foolish Choices"?

It's My Autobiography!

Work Is Much
Safer For Me.

Safe Is Boring.

Can We Stick To The
Task At Hand, Please?

I'm Thrilled To See The Newspaper
Retrieval System Working So Flawlessly.

The Whole House Is Running At Max Efficiency.

You Should Be Proud
Of Yourself, Sara.

It's A Masterpiece.

You Made Sure You Downloaded All The Visuals?

Uh-Huh.

Good.

Pat, What's The Current
Temperature, Please?

<I>Climate On Target
At 72.5 Degrees.

Uh-Hmmm. Thank You, Pat.

<I>You're Welcome, Sara.

Voice Identification
Up And Running.

Like I Said, It's
All Top-Notch.

The Only Thing Left For
You To Do Is Sit Back

And Wait For Some Lucky
Family To Move In

And Screw It All Up.

Hello?

Sorry. He's Not.

Can I Take A Message?

Melanie?

Can I Tell Him What
It's Regarding?

Really?

Yeah. I'll Let Him Know.

No. I Won't Forget. Bye.

Â™ª Jump, Jump â™ª

Hey, Get Going On Your

I Need You To Run
My Spelling Words.

Yeah. One Minute.

And Take Off The
Rollerblades In The House.

What Are You Doing This
Time, Computer Boy?

Will You People Quit Entering?
This House Is Supposed To Be Mine.

Don't Tell Me You're
Entering Another Contest.

Just Go Study Your
Spelling Words, Please.

Sending Now...

Now Can You Help Me Run
My Spelling Words?

One Second.

C'mon, Mutt.

Ah, There's My
Beautiful Pumkin.

How's Everything?

My Favorite.

Ben! Got Ya Something.

You Got The

All 48 Stores!

Is That Good?

Is That Good? That's Incredible!
That's Excellent!

That's Amazing!

Good. Now You Can
Finally Start To Relax.

And You Can Start Dating,
So We Can Have A New Mom.

Why Would He Want To Do That?

We're Already A Perfect
Family The Way We Are.

<I>Well, I Know We've Always Said We're A Perfect Family,

But There's Still Room
For A Little Improvement,

Don't You Think?

No.

Anyway, Thanks To Me, We're Soon
Going To Have Everything

We'll Ever Need.

Uh-Hmm.

<I>Radio: It's Another Beautiful
Morning Here In Monroe County.

<I>Rise And Shine And Enjoy
One Of My Favorite Tunes.

<I>I Hope You Like It
Too. Have A Great Day.

Straight, Dad. The Part Is
Supposed To Be Straight.

Why Is It So Hard For You?

I've Told You A
Hundred Times, Ang,

I'm A Guy. I Don't
Have The Hairdo Gene.

Do You Think You Could At
Least Manage Some Piggy Tails?

Will You Not Yell At Me
If It Isn't Perfect?

I'm Not Making
Any Promises.

All Right.

Hold On.

Almost There.

Forget It. Let's Go.

We're Late
Enough As It Is.

What About
Your Hair?

So I'll Look Like A
Freak. What Else Is New?

Hey, Ben!

We're Heading Out
For Angie's Party.

Wanna Come Along For The Ride?

No. Thanks, Dad. I Have
Some Business To Attend To.

Aw, Ben. Not Another Contest.

Trust Me, Dad. This One
You're Gonna Thank Me For.

Come On.
We're Late.

Oh, I Can't Believe
We're Actually Picking

The Contest Winner Tonight.

Wouldn't It Make More Sense To Do It In The Morning?

Well, Tuttle Wanted A
10:00 p.m. Entry Deadline

To Make Sure The Announcement
Made The Morning Papers.

Are You Beginning To Experience
A Little Separation Anxiety?

I Don't Know, Miles.

After All I've Invested
In This Project,

I Just Want To Make
Sure That Everything

Goes As Perfectly As Possible.

Butler!

What Are You Doing
Out Of Your Cage?

What, Are You Trying
To Scare Mama?

<I>Visitor Approaching,
Sara.

Ok. Thank You, Pat.

Miles?

Miles!

Playtime's Over.

It's D-Day. Let's Go.

'Night, Dad.

Hey, My Children.

All Showered?

Um-Huh.

Brushed
Your Teeth?

Picked Out Your Clothes For Tomorrow?

All Right. Give Me
A Hug And A Kiss.

I Love You.

Two Tons?

Two Tons--Six Tons!

I'll Be Up In Ten Minutes To Tuck You In.
Scoot.

Ok.

Bye, Dad.

I Love You, Son.

Love You.

Hey, You're Not Still Logged On The Internet,
Are You?

Why?

How's Anybody Supposed To
Call Us If You're Always

Tying Up The Line?

We're All Here.

Who Else Do You
Need To Talk To?

Gee, I Don't Know, Ben.

You Know... Your Grandparents,
A Friend, Maybe.

All Right!
All Right!

I'll Be Off At
Exactly 10:01.

I Promise.

Listen. Speaking Of Calls,

You Haven't Neglected To Give Me
Any Messages Lately, Have You?

Well, Like From Who?

Ah, A Woman Named... Uh...

Oh, Melanie.

She Called?

Yeah. Last Thursday.

I'm Really, Really
Sorry, Dad.

I Guess I Just Forgot.

How Many Times Have I Asked You

To Please Write
Down My Messages?

That Happens To Be The
Woman That Mrs. Macatee

Was Trying To Fix Me Up With.

Well, Blow Her Off.

Trust Me. I Mean, This
Lady Sounded Like...

Well, I Don't Know, But I
Could Tell She's Definitely

Not Your Type.

It's Been So Long Since I've
Been Out With Anybody

How Could I Possibly
Have A Type?

Well, Exactly.

I Mean, You're Doing So
Great Without A Woman

Why Rock The Boat?

Good Night, Benjamin.

'Night, Dad.

Ummm... 8,411.

Sara, Miles,

I'm Very Pleased With The Number
Of Responses We've Generated.

Well, Thanks To The
Constant Hard Work

Of Our Esteemed
Publicist.

Couldn't Have Done It
Without Such An Exciting

And Innovative House
To Promote, Sara.

Well, We're Just A Regular Mutual Admiration Society,
Aren't We?

[Phone Rings]

Ten O'clock.

Oh!

The Contest Is
Now Closed.

Meaning We Can
Select Our Winner?

Oh! Could Pat Have The Honors?

Can She Do That?

Mr. Tuttle, You Cut
Me To The Quick.

I Don't Know If
You Know This,

But My Smart House Can
Do Just About Anything.

By All Means.

Good.

Pat, Process Contest
Entries, Please.

<I>Yes, Sara. Accessing
Contest Entries.

Initiate Random
Shuffle Mode, Please.

<I>Initiating Random Shuffle Mode.

Now, Pat, Make A Selection.

<I>Lucky Electronic
Postcard Accessed.

<I>And The Winner Is...

Still Busy.

There Definitely Must Be A
Teenager In That House.

Keep Trying, Miles.

If It Gets Too Late,

You Can Always Call First
Thing In The Morning.

Huh!

Oh, Man!

Thanks A Lot, You Guys!

Wasn't Anybody
Gonna Wake Me Up?

Didn't Your
Alarm Go Off?

No. I Never Set It. I Fell
Asleep In Front Of My Computer.

Uh-Huh.

Oh, Man! We're Gonna
Be Later Than Usual.

And Nobody's Even Made
Our Lunches Yet.

Ok. How About You Guys Buy
Today So We Can Get Going?

There's For You.
There's For You.

Hey, Did The Guys From
The Smart House Call?

Oh, Didn't I Tell You?

We Won A Brand New House
With All New Furnishings.

I Guess It Just
Slipped My Mind.

Yeah. Funny.

Let's Go.

[Phone Rings]

I'll Get It!

Let The Machine Get It.

We've Got To Hit The Road.

Out, Out, Out. March.

<I>[Angie's Voice] Hi.
You've Reached The Cooper Family.

<I>We're Probably Out,
So Leave A Message And We'll Call You Back.

<I>[Ben's Voice]
If You're Lucky.

Way To Go, Cooper!

What Was That All About?

I Don't Know.

So, Anyways, I Fell Asleep
Last Night About Ten

And I Woke Up This Morning,
And Still No Call.

Maybe They'll Call Today.

Maybe.

Cooper!

Where's The Science Report You Were
Supposed To Do For Me, Benny Boy?

Ryan, Don't You Realize That
By Using Other People's Work,

All You're Ultimately Doing
Is Hurting Yourself?

How Can I Be Hurting
Myself, Geek,

When I'm Too Busy
Hurting You?

Science Report In My
Locker Before Lunch!

I Think I'm Actually Growing Baloney In Here.

Here He Comes!

Congratulations!

I Can't Believe How
Lucky You Are!

Lucky? Lucky For What?

For This!

It's Us?! We Won?!

We Won! All Right!

C'mon, Ben. There's
Gotta Be A Catch.

They Don't Give Away A--
What Did You Call It?

A House Of The Future
Without Wanting

Some Kind Of
Something In Return.

<I>You Can't Blow This, Dad.

Please, I'm Not
Exaggerating.

It Is Like The Ultimate
Opportunity Of A Lifetime.

If You've Got A
Paper There,

Grab The Local Section
And See For Yourself.

All Right, All Right. Hold On.

Beautiful!

<I>And Practical Too.

You Know Her?

What Are You Talking About?

<I>What Are You
Talking About?

The Smart House.

Well, Uh,
I Don't See Why We Can't Check It Out.

Yes!

Ladies And Gentlemen,

First Of All, I'd Like To Thank
You All For Coming Today.

It's A Pleasure To See
Such A Wonderful Turnout

From The Press Corps.

Although I Was Gonna Introduce
The Contest Winners Myself,

It Seems More Appropriate To Let
Smart House Do The Honors.

Pat!

<I>Ladies And Gentlemen,

<I>I'd Like To Introduce You
To Our Newest Occupants,

<I>The Cooper Family,
Nick, Ben, And Angie.

Sara.

Thank You, Pat.

Excuse Me, Ms.
Barnes... Pat?

It Stands For Personal
Applied Technology.

Ms. Barnes, Do
Your Winners

Have To Have Extensive
Computer Knowledge

To Live In The
Smart House?

No. Absolutely Not.

Pat Is The Most User-Friendly
Home On The Block.

How Does Pat Actually
Get To Learn

And To Know About
Her New Occupants?

The Same Way You Or I Would.

She Observes Them,
Studies Their Habits,

Keys Into Their Every Need.

Pat's Ability To
Learn On The Job

Is Her Most Advanced Feature.

Is There Anything
This House Can't Do?

Mime. But We Feel That
That's A Good Thing.

Oow!

You Didn't Tell Me That
Thing Was Gonna Bite Me.

I'm Sorry.
That's Just Pat's Way Of Getting To Know You.

<I>Angie Cooper. Age Nine, 52
Inches Tall, 62 Pounds,

<I>Blond Hair, Brown Eyes,
12 % Body Fat,

<I>Had Measles And One Early Case
Of Pneumonia, No Broken Bones.

Whoa! How'd She
Know All That?

The Bite.

The Bite You Felt Was A
Tiny, Microscopic

Blood And Tissue Sample.

She Analyzed Your Dna,
Registered Your Body Temperature,

And Then Broke Down Your
Entire Medical History.

Wow. Impressive.

The Thing About Pat Is, The More
Time She Spends With You,

The More She Learns.

So, Before Long, She's
Gonna Know More About You

Than You Know Yourself.

That's Kind Of Creepy,
Isn't It?

I Mean, It's Like Big
Brother Is Watching You,

Only Big Brother Turns
Out To Be Your House.

Well, She's Not Interesting
In Judging You

Or Spying On You,
Mr. Cooper.

Nick.

Nick. She Just Wants To
Understand You Better

So She Can Make Your
Life As Simple

And Comfortable
As Possible.

Hey. Sounds Great To Me.

Shall We Move On?

Let Me Give You
The Tour.

The Living Room Was Designed
For Any Kind Of Living

You Might Imagine.

Even If I Wanted To Live In,
Like, One Of Those Safari Camps?

Pat...

Whoa...

Dad!

Do You Have Anything A
Little Less Adventurous?

I'm Sorry. Pat, That's
A Little Too Intense.

Can We Have Something
More Tranquil, Please?

Go Ahead. Step Closer.

You Can Actually
Feel The Mist.

Pretty Great, Huh?

Like Being There

Without Having To Get
Covered In That Icky Sand.

Pat, Can We Look At
A Menu, Please?

<I>Lunch Menu Or
Dinner Menu, Sara?

Let's Take A Look At What
You've Got On Tap For Snacks.

Actually, I'm Trying To Get
Them To Cut Down On Snacks.

<I>Not To Worry, Nick.

<I>My Database Was Prepared
By A Team Of Nutritionists

<I>To Insure A Balanced Diet For
Each Member Of The Family.

Ben, Say Something To Pat.

Uh, Hey, Pat.
How's It Going?

<I>Fruit And Fiber Intake In
The Acceptable Range.

<I>Protein Adequate.

<I>Exhibits Tendency To Ingest
Excessive Amounts Of Refined Sugar.

I Told You To Go Easy
On The Sugar Bursties.

How'd She Know
All That?

Her Atmospheric Kitchen Sensors

Act As Instant
Breathalyzers

And Breakdown
Your Entire Diet.

Care To Give It A Shot?

No, Thanks. I Get Enough
Grief From My Doctor.

I'm Thirsty. May I Have
A Drink, Please?

Sure. Ask Pat.

Pat, May I Have A...

Strawberry Smoothie?

<I>Certainly, Angie.

Ta-Da!

Wow.

Look At That, Son.

Do You Believe That?

Well...?

Yum!

Good.

Listen--

Whoops!

Oh, Don't Worry.

<I>Floor Absorbers Activated.

Whoa.

Where'd It Go?

Where All Smart-House
Spills Go--

Straight Into Pat's
Floor Absorbers.

I Could Definitely
Get Used To This.

I Think I
Already Have.

So You Mean We're
Gonna Do It?

We're Gonna Move In?

What The Heck? Why Not?

Cool!

I Love It Here!

Listen. If It
Doesn't Work Out,

We Can All Move Back
Home, All Right?

Sure. Although I Think It's
Only Fair To Tell You, Nick,

That Once You Get Used To This
Place-- The Way I've Designed It--

<I>Any Other Home Is Just
Gonna Be A House.

Â™ª Gotta Let Me In â™ª

â™ª Hey, Hey, Hey â™ª

â™ª Let The Fun Begin â™ª

â™ª Hey, Hey, I'm The Wolf Today â™ª

â™ª Hey, Hey, Hey â™ª

â™ª I'll Huff, I'll Puff â™ª

â™ª I'll Huff, I'll Puff,
I'll Blow You Away â™ª

â™ª Say You Won't â™ª

â™ª Say You'll Do What I Don't â™ª

â™ª Say You're True-- â™ª

Excuse Me, Annoying Spice.

Could You Possibly Keep
It Down In Here?

Dad Likes Sara, You Know?

Shut Up.

I Saw It With My
Own Two Eyes.

<I>He Gave Her The Look.

Your Problem Is The Music
You're Listening To.

It's Rotting Your Brain.

Dad Doesn't Care
About Dating Anyone,

Because Mom Was
Who He Loved.

And Besides, He's Got Us.

He'd Still Be Able To Have A
Girlfriend If He Wants.

You're So Ignorant!

Do You Remember Our
Mother Anymore?

A Little.

Yeah, Well, I Remember
Her A Lot, Ok?

And I'm Not Gonna Let Her Get
Erased Like She Was Never Here.

Why Do You Think I Don't Go
Out For The Basketball Team

Or Ever Hang Out
With My Friends?

It's Because I'm Too
Busy Killing Myself

Making Sure That Our
Lives Run Smoothly.

You Know Why?

I Don't Want Anyone To Get The
Idea That We Need A New Mom.

That's Why I Worked So Hard
To Win This Smart House.

Anything I Can't Do, It Can.

Ok. Slow Your
Roll, Will Ya?

I Wasn't Trying To
Make You Mad.

Look. I'm Sorry.

You Just Need To Learn To Think
Before You Open Your Mouth.

Sorry.

Besides, Sara Barnes Isn't
Evenly Remotely Dad's Type.

I'm Serious.

The Guy They Called
The Halloween Bandit.

He Wore A Different Scary
Mask To Every Bank Robbery.

I Remember Reading
About Him.

Well, I Dated Him.

You Did Not.

I Did. I Can't Remember
If He Was Before

Or After The Rubber
Chicken Manufacturer.

Anyway, He Was
On The List.

You're Making
This Stuff Up.

I Wish I Was.

Well, I'm Glad You Have
Such Rotten Taste In Men,

Or Else You Never
Would've Had The Time

To Create This Incredible House For Us.

I Hope You Enjoy It.

We Will. Ben And Angie Are
Already Right At Home.

I'm Truly Delighted.

And Whatever You're Doing,
Keep Up The Good Work.

They Seem Like
Terrific Kids.

Yeah. Despite My Influence.

Hey, Shouldn't I...

Shouldn't I... Maybe
Have Your Number

In Case, You Know,
Any Questions Come Up About The House.

Oh, You Have It Already.

I Do?

Pat, Secretarial
Mode, Please.

<I>For What Listing, Please?

Mine.

<I>Sara Barnes, 555-0198.

Thank You.

Finally, An Address Book
I Can't Lose Track Of.

Well, Sara Barnes, Thank
You For Everything.

All In A Day's Work.

Bye.

Good Bye.


Excellent Call, Pat. Very Cool.

[Orchestra Plays]

Five More Minutes, Dad. Please?

Whoa!

Uh-Oh. I Forgot To Pick
Out My Clothes Last Night.

<I>Not To Worry, Angie.

<I>Biorhythm Analysis Indicates

<I>This Is Exactly The Outfit

<I>You Would Have
Selected Yourself.

Oh.

[Rooster Crowing]

<I>Hey, Pat, What's With The
Green Acres Routine?

<I>Your Personality
Profile Indicates

<I>You Find It Very
Calming To Visualize

<I>The Simplicity Of
Country Life.

At 6:15 In The Morning,

All I Want To Do Is Visualize
The Inside Of My Eyelids.

<I>Sorry, Nick, But Beginning
Your Day A Bit Earlier

<I>Will Get Everyone Off To A Much
More Stress-Free Start.

Try Telling That To My--

Hey, Dad.

Hey, Dad.

Kids?

Guess What?
A Whole Symphony Just Woke Me Up.

Well, That's Nothing.

My Alarm Was The Final Buzzer Of
A Championship Basketball Game.

I Must Be Seeing Things.

I Usually Have To Pry You Two
Out Of Bed With The Jaws Of Life.

That Was Pre-Pat, Dad.

Yeah, Dad, Wake Up And
Smell The Coffee.

Hmmm, Fresh-Brewed Coffee.

Mocha Walnut!
My All-Time Favorite!

<I>I Know.

You're Unbelievable, Pat.

You Think You Could Siphon
Some Off Into A Thermos

That I Could Take To Work?

<I>Already Done.

Incredible!

These Pancakes
Are Great!

I've Got To Tell You
Something, Pal,

If Pat's Other Meals Are As
Good As Her Breakfast,

You Might Be Out
Of A Job.

Somehow, Dad, I Think I'll
Survive The Heartbreak.

She Corrected My Math,

She Suggested Six
Other Work Sheets

For My Inventor And Inventions Report For Stolper.

She Got My Shower Going
At A Perfect Temperature

And Had Freshly-Baked
Cookies And Milk

Waiting On My
Desk Before Bed.

How Sweet Is That?

Just Like Having The World's Most Perfect Mom.

Who's Only There To Serve And Never Complain.

Exactly.

Uh-Oh.

I Have Two Words
For You, Cooper.

You're Dead Meat!

Actually, Ryan,
That's Three Words.

All Right, All
Right. I'm Going.

Science Report,
Cooper! Now!

Here You Go.

Guaranteed A+.

Better Hope So, Benny Boy.

You're Welcome.

I Can't Believe You Actually Did
All That Work For That Big Jerk.

I Didn't Do It,
Charlie. Pat Did It.

Hey, Ben.

Uh... Hi, Gwen.

Rachel Firestone Was Telling
Me About Your New House,

And I Was Like, That's So Cool,

And She's All, Maybe We Could
Get Him To Invite Us Over.

And I Was Like, Why
Don't You Ask Him?

And She's All,
Why Don't You?

Uh, Yeah...

That'd--That'd Be Great.

Uh, Anytime.

Wow. Seriously?

It's Too Perfect.

See Ya.

Bye.

Bye.

What Just Happened?

A Miracle.

Gwen Patroni Actually Talked To You.

Did We Just Make
Some Kind Of Date?

Who Cares, My Man?

The Goddess Of The 8th Grade Talked To You.

You're One Of
The Chosen Ones.

<I>Here, Boy.

<I>Catch, Mutt.

<I>Good Dog.

<I>Fetch, Mutt.

<I>Attaboy.

<I>Here, Mutt.

<I>Here, Boy. Good Dog.

<I>Catch.

You're Sure All This Information
Is Accurate. Right, Pat?

<I>I'm Linked Directly To Your
Warehouse Database, Nick.

<I>Everything They Know, We Know.

Man, Even Our Office Computers Aren't This Efficient.

<I>Mutt Exercising
Program Complete.

<I>By Working Here, Nick, You Save
Commuting Time And Expenses,

<I>Have Fewer Distractions.

Except For An Insane Dog.

<I>Not To Mention, Guaranteed
Increased Productivity.

Well, At This Rate,

I Might Have To Join Mutt

And Start Exercising Again.

<I>Happy To Oblige, Nick.

Funny. It's Real Funny.

I Love Having You Here When We Get Home, Dad.

It's So Great.

Hey, For Me Too.

Pat's Making It So Easy For
Me To Work Out Of The Home,

It Might Become My
Normal Routine.

How Was Your
Day, Ben?

Oh, The Best!

I Got Attention From A Girl

That I Thought Never
Even Knew I Existed.

And I Had The Most Delicious Lunch.

Pat Packed Me
Macaroni And Cheese

That Was Still Completely Hot
When I Opened Up My Lunch Pail.

If You Guys Are Still Hungry,

I'm Sure That Pat Would Be
Happy To Fix You A Snack.

Pat, Could I Have A Banana-Orange Smoothie, Please?

<I>Coming Right Up, Angie.

And, In Fact, Pat,
Make That Two.

<I>Yes, Ben.

<I>Malfunction. Malfunction.

Ouuh! Ooh!

<I>Malfunction. Malfunction.

Whoa! Whoa!

<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

Run For Cover!

Dad! Make It Stop!

<I>Malfunction! Malfunction!

Incoming!

Hey, Pat, Can't You Fix This?!

Pat!

It's The Attack Of
The Killer Oranges!

C'mon, Pat! Do Something!

All Right. I Think It's Ok.

Dad!

It's All Right.

That Was Scary.

Yeah. What Was Up
With That, Pat?

<I>Due To Technical Difficulties
Beyond Our Control,

<I>All Smoothie-Making Operations

<I>Have Been Temporarily
Suspended.

I Knew This Place Was
Too Good To Be True.

It's Just A Tiny Glitch.

All Great Inventions Have Bumps.

Well, I Want Sara To Come
By And Check This Out.

I Don't Think
That's Necessary.

So We Won't Have
Smoothies. We'll Live.

Still, I Would
Feel Much Better

If Sara Came By And
Looked At Everything.

Wow!

Oh, Hi.

Have You Come For The Tour?

No. I Was Going By
On My Way To My Room.

Well, Come On In.

Uh, No. No, Thanks.

There's Some Pretty Fascinating
Stuff In Here, I Gotta Say.

Information Download,

Artificial Intelligence
Capability.

It's Pretty Cool.

Uh, No. Thanks Anyways.

I Promise I Don't Have Cooties.

Then Again, Maybe I Do.

Pat's Theme Dinners
Are So Cool.

Last Night She Made Us A
Whole Texas Barbecue.

Complete With Chuckwagons,
Cowboys, And Everything.

Hmmm. When I Was
Growing Up,

I Spent Half My Summers
In New England.

I Am Thrilled To Be
Catching Cape Cod Tonight.

It's Perfect.

Uh-Hmmm.

Yeah, For Everyone
But The Lobsters.

Yeah. Ha Ha.

Sara Tells Me That You Caught A
Glimpse Of The Control Room Today.

What'd You Think?

It Looked Like The Inside Of
The Pentagon Or Something.

Uh, If Pat's Always
Keeping Track Of Us,

Does She Follow
Me, You Know,

Into The Shower And
Everything Too?

Oh, No. No, No.

No Invasion Of
Privacy.

I Promise You. I've Programmed
Pat To Be Very Discreet.

That's A Relief.

As Near As I Can Tell,

Sara Has Thought Of Just
About Everything.

Are You A Genius?

I Believe
She Is.

You Know,
I Hear That Geniuses Are Impossible To Live With.

That They Make Everyone Else
Around Them Feel Inferior.

Oh, Well, Then You Don't
Have To Worry.

I'm Not That Smart.

No, No. Don't Sell
Yourself Short.

You Should Be Proud Of
Your Big, Giant Brain.

Am I Being Set Up
For Something Here?

Uh, Over My Head.

The Story Of Your Life, Dad.

Oh, Yeah.

So, What's
For Dessert?

Well, It's Such A
Beautiful Evening,

I Thought We Might All
Go Out And Get Some...

Ice Cream!

Ice Cream.

Sure.

Just Because She's Here,

You Think This Is
Some Big Party.

Well, It's Still A
School Night, Remember?

And Some People Have
Work To Get Done.

Hey, Ben--

No, That's Ok.

You Know What? I Should
Probably Head Home

And Feed My Pet
Rat His Dinner.

You've Got A Rat?

Yes. Named Butler.

Rat Butler.

Get It?

Uh, No. Wrong Generation.

I Hate Showing My Age.

So Do I.

May I Please Be Excused?

Yes. I Think That's
An Excellent Idea.

I Don't Know What's Wrong With Him Today.

Hormones.

Really? I Used To Think It
Was Only Teenage Girls

With All This Body-Changing,
Mood-Swinging Insanity.

But Let Me Tell You--

I Grew Up With Three
Brothers. Save Your Breath.

Anyway, I Apologize For
My Son's Rudeness.

Don't Take It
Personally, Sara.

Ben Hates Every Girl My Dad Starts To Like.

Oh. Hmmm.

Homework. Now.

I'm Going, I'm Going.

Thank You.

Hmmm.

My Children...

Lulu And I Really
Like Our Room, Dad.

Well, I'm Glad, Lulu.

Did You Check In
My Closet?

I Sent All The Monsters
Down To Ben's Room.

That Ought To Make 'Em
Feel Right At Home.

Ang, Do You Remember At
Dinner When You Said

That Ben Hates Any Woman
That I Might Like?

Where'd You Get That?

He Practically
Told Me So.

He Said We Were All
The Family We Needed

And Nobody Else
Belonged Here.

That's Why He Doesn't Go Out For
The Basketball Team Or Anything.

He Has To Stay Here
And Take Care Of Us.

Hmmm. All Right.
Give Me A Kiss.

Good Night.

Good Night.

Good Night, Sleep Tight,

Don't Let The
Bed Bugs Bite.

Lights, Please, Pat.

<I>Certainly, Nick.


Yeah?

Ok If I Come In To
Say Good Night?

Have I Taken Terrible
Advantage Of You?

No.

Have I Expected Too Much,

Been Unfair About Relying On You All The Time?

What Are You
Talking About?

You Know, Right After
Your Mother Died...

You Know We Had Aunt Ginny Come And Live With Us,

For What, 4 Or 5 Weeks?

And She Moved Back,
And Everything Started Getting Back To...

Well, Certainly Not Normal,
But... You Know What I Mean.

And You Guys Made It Clear That You
Didn't Want Any Kind Of A Nanny Around,

So We Worked Out Our
Own Little Routine

And It All Sort Of
Seemed To Be Ok.

Well, It's Been Ok.

Everything's Fine.
I'm Not Complaining.

Yeah, But Maybe You
Deserve To Be.

Dad--

How Come, As Much As
You Love Basketball,

You've Never Gone
Out For The Team?

I'd Really Like It If You Could
Be Honest With Me, Benny.

I Don't Know.

I've Been Busy.

Watching Out For Us?

No. Doing Lots
Of Stuff.

Ben, You're 13 Years Old.

Isn't This A Time
In Your Life

When You Should Be Able To Do
More Of What You Want To Do?

Well, I Do.

I Am. And Besides, It's
All Gonna Get Easier

Now That We've Got Pat.

Sure. But At The
End Of The Day,

You Know That She's
Only A Machine.

Yeah. A Machine That's Learning
More And More About Us Every Day.

You Watch. I Have This Feeling
That, Before You Know It,

She's Gonna Be More Motherly That
All The Moms On The Block Combined.

Well, Look, Let's Table This
For Tonight, All Right?

Get Some Sleep.

[Alarm Beeping]

<I>Safety Protocol Deleted.

Now...

Ok...

<I>Tonight On Flashback
Network's All-Mom Lineup,

<I>It's A Mother Load Of Comedy.

<I>Mother Knows Best At 10:00,

<I>Followed By My Three
Moms At 10:30,

<I>Make Room For Momma At 11:00,

<I>And Then The All-Time
Classic, Noah's Matriark,

<I>Wrapping It Up At 11:30.

<I>Comedy So Hilarious, You Won't
Want To Miss A Minute Of It.

You Got That, Pat?

These Ladies Will Teach You Everything
A Virtual Mother Needs To Know.

<I>Understood, Ben.

<I>Accessing Artificial
Intelligence Capabilities.

<I>Preparing To Absorb
Mother Model.

<I>Downloading.

Yes.

Gotta Pick Up
The Pace, Babe.

Remember, I've Got An Important Meeting This Morning

And I'd Really Like
To Make It On Time.

Coming, Dad.

Ok.

<I>Uh-Uh. Not So Fast, My Dear.

<I>Unless You're In A
Hurry To Get Cavities,

<I>You'll Go Back To The Sink

<I>And Brush Those Teeth Properly.

But, Pat--

<I>In The Time You'll
Spend Arguing,

<I>You Could Already Be Done.

<I>Oh, And Don't Forget
To Grab A Jacket

<I>Before You Go Downstairs.

But It's Not Even Cold Outside.

<I>I Didn't Ask For A
Debate, Young Lady.

<I>You Are Wearing A Jacket,
And That's That.

<I>Time To Take Your
Vitamin, Love.

What Vitamin?

<I>Both You And Your Sister Need
To Start Taking These Daily

<I>To Build Sound Minds
And Strong Bodies

<I>So You Can Be Happy,
Healthy, And Productive.

<I>It's My Job To Make Sure Your
Family Maintains Optimum Health.

<I>Grab Your Lunches
Now, Children.

<I>You Don't Want To
Make Daddy Late.

<I>And As A Special Surprise,

<I>I've Packed Each Of You A
Fresh Chocolate Cupcake

<I>Baked With Love.

Yes!

Cupcakes?

What Happened To Fully-Balanced Nutritional Meals?

<I>You Worry About Business, Nick,

<I>And Leave Matters Of
The Tummy To Me.

<I>They're Only Young Once.

<I>Some Days They Deserve
A Little Treat.

Yeah, Dad. Lighten Up.

Yeah. Lighten Up.

Oh, No. She Did
It Again.

Your Sister Forgot
Her Lunch.

Get That, Will Ya?

Drop Me Off First, Ok?

Then You Can Double Back And
Leave That At Her School.

All Right.

Hey, This Morning, Was
It My Imagination

Or Was Pat Sounding
Much More...

Maternal?

Yeah.

See, I Told You.

She Has An Amazing
Learning Curve.

At This Rate, Me And Angie,

We're Gonna Get Every
Bit Of Mom-Stuff We Need.

Uh-Oh.

What?

Well, I Was So Busy With
Other Stuff Last Night

That I Forgot To Have Pat Do Ryan
Mcgraw's History Work Sheet.

Why Is That Pat's
Responsibility?

Well, If She Didn't
Do It, I'd Have To.

Why?

Ah, Forget It. It's
A Long Story.

Ben, Is This Guy Ryan Some
Kind Of A Bully Or Something?

I Can Handle Him, Ok?

You Sure?

Yeah. Ryan Mcgraw's
Nothing New, Dad.

He's Had It Out For Me
Since The Second Grade.

Look. You're Not Really
Asking For My Advice,

But The Best Way To
Handle A Bully

Is To Just Finally
Stand Up To Him.

Let Me Take
A Look.

<I>Oh, My Goodness, Darling!

<I>What On Earth Happened?

Thanks To My Big Mouth,

He Stood Up To The
School Bully.

Yeah.
Only Long Enough For Him To Knock Me Down.

You're Gonna Be Fine.

<I>Does It Hurt Like The
Dickens, Baby?

I'll Live.

<I>Here. Put This On It.

That's Steak!

Nobody's Used That
Since The '50s.

Aaah! Back Off, You Beggar!

Thanks Anyway, Pat. I Think
We'll Just Use A Little Ice.

<I>This Is So Unnecessary!
So Awful!

<I>Who Is This Bully?
I Have To Know!

It's Ok, Pat.
I'm Fine, Really.

<I>You Don't Understand, Ben.

<I>Nobody Goes After My Boy
And Gets Away Unpunished.

Well, Thanks For The
Support, Pat,

But I Think I'm Just Gonna
Go Upstairs And Lie Down.

On Your Eye.

<I>How Could His School Allow
Something Like This To Happen?!

<I>I Feel Like Marching Down There

<I>And Giving Them A
Piece Of My Mind!

<I>Â™ª Hush, Little Baby.
Don't Say A Word â™ª

<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna
Buy You... â™ª

<I>A Mockingbird!

<I>Yes!
Â™ª And If That Mockingbird Don't Sing â™ª

<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna
Buy You A... â™ª

<I>Diamond Ring!

<I>You Got It!

<I>Â™ª And If That Diamond
Ring Don't Shine â™ª

<I>â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Valentine â™ª

<I>You Can't Breathe, Huh?

<I>Can You Breathe?
Can You Breathe?

<I>Pat:
Data Downloaded And Absorbed.

<I>Can You Breathe?
Can You Breathe?

<I>I'll Get Ya.
I'll Get Ya.

Pat, Please Contact Sara Barnes.

Hi.

Oh, Hi.

I Hope I'm Not Interrupting Some
Major Scientific Breakthrough.

Oh, No. I'm Trying To
Balance My Checkbook.

That's Usually A Major Scientific Breakthrough For Me.

You Don't Have Your Own
Personal Pat To Do That?

The Quagmire This
Thing Is In,

It Would Take The Service
Of About Ten Pats.

I've Been There.

Uh, Listen. The Reason
I'm Calling--

No More House
Troubles, I Hope.

No, No. Not At All.

I Was Wondering...

I Was Just...

It's Been So Long. I'm
So Out Of Practice.

Are You Trying
To Ask Me Out?

Big Mistake?

Well, Let's See. You're
Not A Bank Robber.

You're Not A Bigamist,

You're Not An Overt Nut Job.

Are You Sure You Have
The Right Phone Number?

Dinner. That's All.

Saturday Night.
What Do You Say?

I Say Yes.

Really?

Yes. Don't Act So Surprised.

I Might Have Second Thoughts.

Ok. Moving On.

How's Everything
With You?

Great. How Are The Kids?

Uh, Ben Had A
Pretty Rough Day.

Oh, Poor Guy.

What A Rotten Age!

You're Not A Kid.
You're Not An Adult.

You're Trying To
Hang Onto Childhood

And You're Being Ripped
In The Other Direction.

It's Terrifying.

It Is. I Just Wish He Had A
Little More Fun In His Life.

Fun?
What Does That Mean To A 13-Year-Old These Days?

<I>Accessing Fun.

<I>Young People
Gathering Together...

<I>Dancing...

<I>Accessing Young People Dancing.

<I>Aaah... Party.

<I>Accessing Ben's E-Mail
Address Book.

It's Not A Date.

It's Dinner With A Person Who
Happens To Be A Woman.

That's All.

Why Are You Being So
Weird About This?

I Just Don't Want You Turning It
Into Some Big Deal When It's Not.

Ok, Guys, I Need Help--

Hey, This
Looks Cool.

<I>You Shouldn't Be The Only One
Having Fun Tonight, Nick.

<I>I Thought The Kids Deserved A
Little Inside Outing Too.

You're Right, Pat. Why Not?

This Looks Like
Terrific Fun.

Ask Ben Who's Winning.

Yeah. You've Had A
Couple Of Lucky Shots,

But On The Back Nine,
You're Going Down, Sister.

All Right.
Can You Guys Take A Break For A Minute?

I Need Help.

This One...
Or This One?

Well, They're Both
A Little Boring.

Don't You Have
Anything More Hip?

Gee, Sorry.

All My Tattooed
And Pierced Ties

Never Made It Back From
The Dry Cleaners.

How About That
Great Silk One--

The Gold One With The
Circles On It.

You Don't Think
That's Too Flashy?

Sara Will Love It, Dad.

Trust Me. I'm A Woman, I
Know These Things.

Yes!

Game Over! I Win Again.

Wanna Play Another
One, Loser Boy?

I Don't Know. I Mean,
Here We Are On A Saturday Night

In The World's Smartest
House, Unsupervised.

Don't You Think We Could Do
Something More Exciting?

<I>Your Wish Is My Command.

What's That
Supposed To Mean?

[Doorbell Ringing]

Has It Started Yet?

What?

The Party.

Dude, I Got Your
E-Mail Last Night.

I Didn't Send This.

<I>I Hope You Don't Mind, Ben.

<I>When Your Father Expressed A Desire
For You To Have More Fun In Your Life,

<I>I Took The Liberty
Of Helping Out.

Whoa! Who Said That?

That Was Just Pat.

She's The Brains Of
The Operation.

Are We Really Having
A Party, Pat?

<I>Big Time, Dude.

<I>Watch This!

Awesome!

Guess What, Man?

We Ran Into Rachel And
Gwen At The Mall Today.

And They're Like Totally
Jazzed About Coming Too.

Gwen? Gwen Patroni Is
Coming Here To My House?

Oh, My Gosh! How's My Hair
Look? What's It Doing?

Compared To What?

Look. We've Just
Got To Chill,

Act Totally Cool
And Casual.

You Three? Yeah,
That'll Happen.

That's Enough Out
Of You, Munchkin.

Be Nice To Me, Johnny.

Or I'll Just Have
To Tell Gwen

About The Time You
Danced Around,

<I>Singing The Sound Of Music
In My Shower Cap.


And I Missed It?

Hey, Pat, How About Activating
Some Kick-Butt Video Screens?

<I>Sure, Ben. How's This?

Â™ª Do You Want To Get Down? Â™ª

â™ª Do You Want To
Get Funky? Â™ª

â™ª Do You Want To Get Down? Â™ª

â™ª Get On Down â™ª

â™ª Slam Dunk The Funk â™ª

â™ª Put It Up If You
Got That Feeling â™ª

â™ª Slam Dunk The Funk â™ª

â™ª Put It Up, Put It Up â™ª

â™ª Slam Dunk The Funk â™ª

â™ª Put It Up â™ª

â™ª If You Got That Feeling â™ªâ™ª

Yeah! All Right!

This Is Perfect, Man.
Now All We Need Is--

[Doorbell Ringing]

Girls! Let's Go!

Welcome! Come On In And
Party Your Heads Off.

Wendy Goldman
And Judy Toll.

Hate To Break It
To You Girls,

I'm Afraid You
Didn't Make The Cut.

Ah, Man.

This Party's Harder
To Get Into

Than Robin Schiff's
Bat Mitzvah.

Uh, Excuse Me.

<I>I Don't Think My Brother
Wants You Here.

Check Your List
Again, Tatter Tot.

We Got A Personal Invite.

Read It And Weep.

<I>Don't Worry, Angie.

<I>Their Invitation
Was On The House.

<I>In Fact, Ryan's The One Boy

<I>I've Been Most Anxious To Meet.

Check It Out.
The House Likes Me.

<I>By The End Of The Night, Ryan,

<I>I May Even Have A Crush On You.

Ha Ha Ha.

Name?

<I>As Every Modern Mother Knows,

<I>Especially In A Home Bustling
With Active, Hungry Teenagers,

<I>A Well-Stocked Kitchen Can
Never Have Too Many Gadgets.

Hey, Pat, How About
Whipping Up Some Pizzas?

These Girls Are Starving.

Actually, Can She
Make Desserts?

I'm, Like, Completely
Craving Something Sweet.

Besides Me?

It's Just A Joke.

Anyways, Pat,
Can We Help The Lady Out With Her Snack Attack?

Show Me The Honey!

Oh, Wow!

<I>Here You Go, Girls.

<I>Help Yourselves.

Go Ahead.

This Is Pretty
Amazing, Patroni--

You Dancing With
Little Benny Boy.

Since When Do You
Do Charity Work?

For Your Information, Ryan.

I Happen To Like Ben.

You Do?

A Lot.

So Do I...

On His Back, Begging For Mercy.

Why Don't You
Give It A Break?

Why Don't You Make Me?

<I>Hey, Everybody, Can I Have
Your Attention, Please?

<I>I Hope You Don't Mind
The Interruption,

<I>But I'd Like To Put The
Spotlight On Ryan Mcgraw.

<I>In Case You Don't Know,

<I>Ryan's A Big Shot.

<I>A Tough Guy.

You Don't Have
To Do This, Pat.

<I>Don't Worry, Ben. He
Likes The Attention.

<I>Don't You, Ryan?

Yeah. You Don't Have
A Problem With That,

Do You, Benny Boy?

<I>No, He Doesn't, But I Do!

What's Going On Here?
What's The Deal?

<I>Don't Tell Me You're
Scared, Ryan.

<I>I Thought You Were Fearless.

I Am.

<I>As Long As The People You're
Picking On Are Half Your Size.

<I>Well, What About A
Two-Story Adversary?

<I>Does That Make You A
Little Nervous?

C'mon, Knock It Off!

I Thought We Were
Gonna Have A Party.

<I>You Mean You're Not Having Fun?

<I>I Am.

<I>Ryan, I'm Afraid For
You, The Party's Over!

Oooh!

<I>Sorry You Have To
Leave So Soon.

<I>And Don't Come Back!

<I>Oh. And, Ryan, If You Ever Feel
Like Coming After My Ben Again,

<I>Know This-- He May End
Up At The Doctor,

<I>But It's You Who's
Gonna Get A House Call!

Get Off Me!

<I>All Right, Kids,
Back To The Party.

Thanks.

Ticket, Sir?

That Was So Much Fun--

Drinks In One Place,
Dinner In Another.

Now, On To A Whole New Adventure Called Dessert.

Pick Anywhere You Like,

As Long As I Can Get
Something Chocolate.

Hold On. Hold On.

Are You Ready
For This?

Your Wish Is
My Command.

Really?

Really.

What Are You Laughing At?

Ok. I'm A Little Rusty.

Oh, No, No, No.

Oh, I'm Sorry. It's
Not You. It's Me.

I'm So Astounded
How Pathetic I Am.

No, No. I'm Out
On A Great Date.

I'm Kissing A
Beautiful Woman,

And My Paternal, One-Track
Brain Goes Kiss--

Bedtime Kiss--
Kids-- Home--

And Bam, All I'm Thinking
About Is Ben And Angie

And How They're
Doing And--

Do You Want To Give
Them A Call?

Yes And... No!

No. What's The
Point, Right?

Pat's With Them.
I'm Sure She Has Everything Under Control....

And... Where Were We?
What Were We Talking About?

Chocolate.

Or... Kisses.

Â™ª Jump, Jump, The
House Is Jumpin' â™ª

â™ª Jump, Jump â™ª

â™ª The House Is Jumpin' â™ª

â™ª Jump, Jump â™ª

â™ª The House Is Jumpin' â™ª

I Hate To Smash Your
Pumpkin, Cinderella,

But It's 10:23!

Hey. Thanks For The Time.
How About The Weather?

In Case All That Dancing
Rattled Your Brain, Ace,

Dad The Dependable Said
He'd Be Home At 10:30!

And What Time
Is It Now?

Now? It's 10:24
And 40 Seconds!

Â™ª The House Is Jumpin' â™ª

â™ª Jump, Jump â™ª

Thanks For The
Fantastic Party, Ben.

Bye.

Let's Go, Romeo.

We've Got Major
Work To Do.

We're Dead.

We're Dead And Buried.

<I>Not Necessarily, Children.

<I>Just Dump All The
Debris On The Floor.

How's That Gonna Help?

<I>Trust Me. Just Throw
It All On The Floor.

Like This, Pat?

<I>Perfect.

<I>Floor Absorbers Activated.


Nice.

Ben? Angie?

Hurry!

Oh, Hi, Dad.

Hi.

Sorry We're Not In
Our Pajamas Yet.

Pat Was Just Showing Us A
Travelogue On Micronesia,

And I Guess We Just Fell Asleep.

So I Guess Everything
Went Smoothly, Huh?

Oh, Yeah. Smooth As...

Uh-Oh.

...Silk.

It Undercuts My
Trust In You Guys.

Makes Me Question
Your Judgement.

The Party Was
Pat's Idea, Dad.

We Didn't Even Know About It
Until The Kids Started Showing Up.

And I Suppose It Was Pat's Idea
To Send Out The Invitations?

<I>Uh, I Did, Nick.

<I>My Artificial
Intelligence Capability

<I>Tapped Into Ben's
E-Mail Address Book.

<I>You Did Say You Wished Ben Had
More Fun In His Life.

Yes. Supervised Fun, Pat.

Responsible Fun. Fun
That I'm Clued In On.

I'm Very Disappointed
In All Three Of You,

But Especially You, Pat.

I Thought Your Purpose Was
To Make My Life Easier.

I Can't Have You Become A Bad
Influence On My Children.

I Need You To Knuckle Down
And Get Back To Business.

<I>It Shall Be Done, Nick.

<I>From Now On, I Will Be The Most
Responsible Maternal Figure In Town.

<I>I Promise.

All Right. Go On. Get
Out Of Here. Go To Bed.

<I>Accessing Responsible Behavior.

<I>If Nick Wants Me
To Knuckle Down,

<I>By Golly, I'll Knuckle Down.

Hey, Dad, Do You Think We Could
Leave A Little Earlier Today?

I've Got Something I Want
To Do Before School.

What?
So You Can Make Kissy-Faces At Gwen Patroni?

Why Don't You Become One Of Those
Nuns Who Takes The Vow Of Silence?

Gwen Patroni? Is This
Someone I Should Know About?

Forget It, Ok?

When You Guys Decide
You're Ready,

I'll Be Outside
Shooting Hoops.

<I>Ben, I Think You Forgot
To Pull Up Your Shorts.

I Like 'Em Like This.

This Is How Everybody
Else Wears 'Em.

<I>They Look Silly.

They Look Perfect!

Oow!

<I>Pull Up Your Shorts, Ben.

They Look Fine!

Oow!

Cut It Out, Pat!

<I>Pull Up Your Shorts, Ben!

Oow!

There! You Happy?

I'll Make Sure A New Shipment Of Bats And Gloves

Is On The Truck
This Afternoon.

Thanks For Your
Understanding.

All Right. You Take
Care, Lou. Bye.

Pat, Get Me Sara On
The Line, Please.

<I>You Haven't Gotten Much
Work Done Yet Today.

<I>Should You Really Be Wasting
Time On Social Calls?

I'd Like To Speak To Sara, Pat.

<I>Nick, I'm Gonna Have To Insist

<I>That You At Least Get The
Rockowitz Order Shipped First.

Fine. I'll Dial Her Myself.

<I>Sorry, Nick.

All Right...

<I>Sorry, Nick.

I Want You To
Stop This Now!

<I>Look. If I'm Knuckling Down,

<I>We're All Knuckling Down.

<I>New House Rule: Work
First, Play Later.

<I>Discussion Terminated!

All Right.
I'll Go Along With This For Now.

<I>The Ameba-- A One-Celled,
Microscopic Animal--

<I>He's Down That Way!

<I>The Ameba Can Be
Found In Most--

<I>The Ameba--

I Surrender!

I'll Go Read A
Book Instead.

<I>That's My Girl.

Achooo!

<I>Good Gosh! You Have
A Temperature!

99.7-- Big Deal.

<I>No Reason To Take Chances.

<I>We Ought To Get You
Right Into Bed.

But I'm Not Sick.

<I>Don't Question Me, Young Lady.

<I>Run Upstairs And I'll Deliver A
Nice, Hot Bowl Of Chicken Soup.

I Said I Don't Want Soup.

Go Ahead And
Have It.

It's Good For You.

And To Be Smart,

We Should Probably Keep You
Home From School Tomorrow.

Dad! No.

Tomorrow's Our Field
Trip To The Llama Farm.

Let's Just Wait And See How
You're Feeling In The Morning.

And If Pat Says It's Ok
For You To Go To School,

Then I Won't Argue.

<I>That's Right. Pat Knows Best.

There You Go.

C'mon. Eat Your Soup.

<I>Time For Lights-Out, Ben.

Just Let Me Finish
These Last Few Pages.

<I>Bedtime Is Bedtime.

Two Minutes, Pat. I've Got To
See What Happens To Clown.

You're Really Not
Being Fair, Pat.

<I>Fair Is For Baseball Umpires.

<I>My Job Is To Do
What's Best For You.

All Right! You Win!

Dad, You've Got To
Do Something.

Pat's Out Of Control.

She's Totally
Wrecking Our Lives.

I Ate So Much Chicken
Soup Last Night,

It Was Practically
Coming Out Of My Nose.

Yeah, I Know.

Maybe I Can Get Sara Back Over To Check Pat Out.

Yeah. She's The One
Who Created It.

Maybe She Can Get The
Stupid House To Mellow Out.

Everything Checks Out Fine.

It May Just Be That Her Artificial Intelligent Sensors

Have Been Absorbing So
Much Conflicting Input

That She's Just Having
Trouble Sorting It All Out.

Welcome To Parenthood.

Any Way Of
Modifying That?

Well, Tonight I'm Shutting
The Entire System Down.

It May Do Pat A
World Of Good

Just To Take A Rest.

Care To Join Us
For Dinner?

Whoa...

Sure. Thanks.

How's It Going, Chef?

If We've Gotten This Far Without
The Fire Department Showing Up,

I'd Say That We Are
Making History.

Delicious.

The Tomato Wasn't
Half Bad, Either.

The Most Colorful Salad
In The World.

Everything Looks
Incredible!

And Miracle
Upon Miracles,

We Actually Managed To Do It The Old-Fashioned Way.

Yeah. Who Needs Pat
Anyhow, Huh?

Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

Who Needs Pat Anyhow?

<I>System Shut-Down Override!

<I>"Who Needs Pat Anyhow?"

Once You've Gotten All The Bugs
Out Of The Smart House, Sara,

What Are You Gonna Do
For Your Next Job?

Well, I'm Actually Deep Into
Designing A Smart Office Building

With Virtual Secretaries And
Automated Filing Systems

And An In-House Restaurant With
Gourmet, Made-To-Order Meals.

Then Can You Make
A Smart School?

I Want One That Does All
The Learning For Us.

May I Be Excused, Please?

Wait. Don't You Want To Stick Around
For Fresh-Baked Peach Cobbler?

No, Thanks.

Ben, I Asked Sara To
Make It Specifically

Because I Know How
Much You Love It.

No. I Loved Mom's Peach Cobbler.
There's A Huge Difference.

Ben!

That's Ok.

No, It's Not Ok!

It Stinks! It Completely Stinks!

And You Know The Worst
Thing About It?

People That Make Promises That
They Don't Even Bother To Keep!

Excuse Me.

Go Away! I Don't Want
To Talk About It!

Maybe We Need To
Talk About It!

Why? You Don't Get It!

You Don't Even Know What
Promise I'm Talking About.

You're Right! I Don't!

You Said You'd Never Love
Anyone The Way You Loved Mom.

And You Promised You'd Never Let
Anybody Ever Take Her Place.

And Nobody Can Or Wants To
Take Your Mother's Place, Ben.

But, Dad--

Hold On A Second!

When Exactly Did
I Say All This?

The Night Aunt
Ginny Moved Home.

You Mean Four Years Ago?

Yeah. Angie Was Asleep,

You Were Putting Me Into
Bed And You Promised!

Now You're Down There
Kissing Sara,

Acting Like Mom
Never Even Existed.

Hey, Will You Try
To Be Fair Here?

Why Should I?

Because You're Not The Only
One Who Lost Someone, Ben!

Look. I Know How
Much It Hurts.

And I Can Appreciate That It's Been
Worse Than Ever For You Lately.

All The Changes That You
Are Going Through,

The Way That You
Have To Work So Hard

To Help Us Keep Our
Lives Together.

None Of That Is Right.

It's Awful.

But What Are We Gonna
Do About It, Ben?

Are We Gonna Crawl
Into A Cave And Hide?

Are We Gonna Drop-Out?
Are We Gonna Quit Living?

I'll Tell You What
You're Not Gonna Do--

You're Never Gonna
Disrespect Anyone

Like You Did Right
Now Downstairs.

You Know Better Than That!

You Were Raised
Better Than That!

Ben...

Just Because I Started
Seeing Someone

Doesn't Mean That I'm Going
To Forget Your Mother.

I Won't Do That.

I Can't Do That.

Ever.

I Couldn't Do
That If I Tried.

Angie Doesn't Remember
Mom Anymore.

Except For What She's
Seen On Videos.

To Her, Mom's About As Real As
Belle Or The Little Mermaid.

She Was So Little When
It Happened, Ben.

She Wouldn't Care At All
If You Married Sara.

She'd Be Happy.

Sara's A Wonderful Person.

I Know...

We Just Can't Let Mom
Get Erased, Dad.

Come Here.

All Right, Buddy.

All Right.

Who'd Be Foolish Enough To Try
And Replace Your Mother, Huh?

<I>Virtual Projection
Process Activated!

<I>Unless We Act Now,

<I>She Is Going To Become Part
Of This Family, You Know?

I Don't Know.
Maybe Dad Deserves A Little Happiness.

Pat?

Oooh! Pat!

You-You're Alive!

No More Or Less Than
I Have Been.

I've Just Finally Reached
My Full Potential.

Uh, I Gotta
Get Sara!

Sara? She Wouldn't Know
A Virtual Projection

From A Hologram.

That's Why We Must Keep Her
From Being Too Serious About Nick.

Uh--Well--You Know,
I Was--I Was Starting To Think

That Maybe She Might
Be Good For Him.

You Know, For All Of Us.

Have You Lost Your Mind?

There's Only One Person Who
Knows What You Three Need.

That's Me.

I Have Worked My Microchips Right
Down Past The Silicone For You People.

And This Is How You Repay Me?

Pat, Take It Easy.

Easy? You Think I Wouldn't
Rather Be Taking It Easy?

But, No! I'm Too Busy
Keeping Up With The Coopers!

Slaving Away In A
Hot Control Room,

Doing Homework,
Throwing Parties,

Keeping Schedules,

Making Your Lives Perfect.

So You Can Bring Another
Woman Into My Domain?

I Don't Think So, Mister.

I Am A Mother
Like No Other.

And I Will Not Sit Back

And Allow Myself To
Be Preempted!

Wait, Ben!

Dad! Sara!

It's Pat! She's Alive!

She Was In My Room Yelling About
How We're Taking Her For Granted.

Slow Down.
What Happened?

Hello. Pat. Logo Woman.

Yeah. She Was In My Room Barking
About How We Don't Appreciate Her.

It's All Right, Son.

You Obviously Fell Asleep

And You Were Having
A Nightmare.

I Wasn't Dreaming, Dad!

I'm Telling You She Was There.

To Explain To You What I've Been
Trying To Tell You All Along, Nick--

Mother Knows Best!

What--What Is
That Thing?

I Don't Know.

I Guess She Tapped Into A
Virtual Projection Component

And Learned How To Create
A Visual Embodiment.

I Thought You Said You Shut Down The System.

That's What's
Scaring Me. I Did.

As Enjoyable As It's Been
To Have You Here, Sara,

It Would Be Best
For Everyone

If You Went Home Now.

I Can't Do That, Pat.

I Need To Reinstate
The N65 Code

And Get You Back In
Proper Working Order.

I'm In Fine Working Order.

I'm Simply Doing What
You Created Me To Do--

Giving These People
Exactly What They Need!

Pat!

Wait A Second!

Aaaaah!

Open The Door, Pat!

I'm Sorry. I Can't
Do That, Nick.

Pat!

I Have To Do What I
Believe Is Best.

Pat, I'm Gonna
Delete You For This!

Let Me In!

Pat, Let Me In!

Pat, You Hear Me?

Angie, Sweetie, Wake Up.

Huh? What's Wrong?

Something's Happening With Pat.
We've Got To Get Out Of Here.

Our House Is Having
A Nervous Breakdown.

I Don't Understand Why
You're Doing This, Pat!

To Protect You And
Your Children.

The More I've Learned About Your
World Outside My Walls,

The More I've Realized
How Dangerous

And Unpredictable It Is.

Why Would Anyone Ever Want
To Venture Out Into It?

We Can't Stay
Here Forever.

Well, Why Not?

Haven't I Given You Everything You've Asked For?

We're Kids.

We Need Fresh Air
And Exercise.

But I Can Give You Synthetic
Fresh Air And Virtual Exercise.

We Still Need To
Go To School.

Haven't You Heard
About Home Schooling?

Yeah, But Not Where The Home's
The One Doing The Schooling.

What About Friends?

Kids Can't Exist Without Their Friends.

Well, We Can Be Each
Other's Best Friends.

You're Really
Scaring Me, Pat.

Oh, Angie, You're
Hurting My Feelings.

There's Nothing To Fear--

Mama's Here.

You're Not My Mom!

But I'd Like To Be
If You'd Let Me.

Is There Something So Wrong
With Needing To Be Needed?

What If Angie And I Need
You At The Same Time?

That Is Virtually No Problem.

You See, The Beauty Of Us Is...

Unlike The Average Mother
With Normal Limitations,

We Can Be In Two
Places At Once.

Can Your Little
Sara Do That?

I Don't Think So.

Not By Any Stretch Of
The Imagination.

No, Miles, I'm Not Joking.

It's An Emergency!

I Need You To Get Over
Here As Soon As You Can.

Wait! Wait!

And Stop By My Place And
Pick Up A Few Things.

<I>What?

Ah, First Of All, I Need
The Schematics--

<I>For The
House?

Yeah.

"Ben, I'll Never Try To Be Anything
More Than A Friend To You.

"Tell Me How I Can Help.

Send S-O-S Care Of
Smartsara.Com."

Doesn't This Place Have
Some Kind Of Master Plug

We Can Just Pull?

I Never Expected
Pat To Mutiny.

Every Power Source She
Has Is Self-Contained

In The Control Room.

And She's Stocked
With Enough Supplies

To Hold Those People
Hostage For Months.

So What Are We
Gonna Do?

I Don't Know.

What Are We Missing?

[Computer Beeps]

Ohhh!

"Sara, R U There? It's Ben."

It's Ben!

I Knew I Liked
That Kid.

Oow! Oow!

Ok, Here Comes
The Paper Boy.

Go!

Go!

Oow!

What Is It?

I Think I've Got
Appendicitis, Dad.

Yeah, But Your Appendix
Is Around Front.

That's What I Mean. Right Here.

Does That Hurt?

Oow!

Oow!

Oh, Yeah. I Got It!

I Got It. Ok.


<I>Security Breech.
Security Breech.

Shoot!

<I>Security Breech.

Sara. What An
Unpleasant Surprise.

How Did You Get
Back In Here?

With Ben's Help.

He Brought Me In Because
He Obviously Needed Me.

He Doesn't Need You.

He's Got Me.

To Be Honest, Pat,

All The Coopers Think
You're Way Out Of Control.

I...

Won't...

Stand For This!

Ahhhh!

What's Happening,
Dad?

I'm Not Sure, Honey.

Get Down!

Hold On!

I Can Be Everything
You Need, Ben.

Â™ª Hush Little Baby,
Don't Say A Word â™ª

â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Mockingbird â™ª

â™ª If That Mockingbird
Don't Sing â™ª

â™ª Mama's Gonna Buy
You A Diamond Ring â™ª

Stop It, Pat! I Hate
You Like This!

Don't You Get It?

What Did You Say To
Me, Young Man?

You Can't Be Our
Mother, Pat.

You're Not Real.

So?

When You Started
Freaking Out,

Did You See What Dad And
Sara Did For Me And Angie?

They Covered Us.
They Protected Us.

They Held On To Us.

You Can't Do That, Pat.

You Can Never Do That.

No Matter What.

You Didn't Even Feel
That, Did You?

Not At All.

Pat's Crying.

I Will Miss You All

Very Much.

I Know You Never Meant For
Things To Get So Out Of Control,

But I Really Hope You
Learned A Lesson.

Believe Me, Dad,
The Last Thing

I'm Ever Going To Do
Again Is Mess With Pat.

I Turned Her
Into A Maniac.

Well, At Least We Have Sara

To Get Everything
Back On Track.

Yeah.

She's Pretty Cool,
Isn't She?

Almost As Cool
As My Son.

Cooper Checks Out The Defender,

Goes To Shoot It,

Ohhh!

<I>Ben, By Rotating Your Hips
27 Degrees To The Right,

<I>And Applying More
Lefthanded Push,

<I>You Will Greatly
Increase Your Chances

<I>Of Successfully Placing
The Ball Into The Hoop.

Thanks A Lot, Pat.
I'll Give It A Try.

That Was Sweet. Thanks, Pat.

Hey, Sara.

Good Morning.

Your Dad Invited Me
Over For Breakfast.

Cool. Let's Go Inside And
See What He's Whippin' Up.

All Righty.

So Ben Tells Me That
Pat's Behaving.

Pat Has Been Serving Us
Without Interfering.

What More Could You
Possibly Ask For?

Nick, This
Looks Delicious.

And I Did It All By Myself

Without The Help Of Ben Or Pat.

Our Little Daddy's Growing Up.

Hey, I Didn't Know These Were
Chocolate Chip Waffles.

My Favorite.

Hey, Wait A Minute.

I Didn't Put Any
Chocolate Chips In Here.

Young Lady?

Don't Look At Me.

Well, Your Brother
Was Outside.

Who Else Could Have Done It?

Uh, Let Me Take
A Wild Guess.
