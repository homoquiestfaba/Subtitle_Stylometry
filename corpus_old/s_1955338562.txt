      <i> One Night Stand,</i>

  with comedian Louis C.K.

      Ladies and gentlemen,
           Louis C.K.

         [applause]

      All right; thank you.

     Thank you very much.

      Thanks, you guys;
      that's very nice.

         Thank you.

        How you doing,
          all right?

              Good.

     Good; this is good.
         You're out.

     Being out is good.

            It is.

     I don't go out anymore.

     I have a baby now,
     so I don't go out.

  Some of you have babies,
  but you don't love them,

         so you're here;
          that's cool.

  No, I mostly just go out
      with my daughter.

       I went to the park
     with her the other day.

  I was at this park and--
    New York City park--

and they had these "No Drinking"
       signs at the park,

     but it doesn't say,
       "No Drinking."

 It has a picture of, like,
       a martini glass

     with a line through it.

 Are those really the people
    causing the problems

      with the drinking
        in the parks?

        Are they reaching
      their target audience

      with a martini glass,
             really?

  Shouldn't there be, like,
      a bottle in a bag

     with a line through it?

Do you see people at this park
    at 4:00 in the morning:

     "Hey, motherfucker!"

    I try to go to movies,
 but movies are all shit now.

 They are; they're all shit.

     Like they just have
  this machine that just--

      just makes shit.

       I try to see--
      I rented a movie.

 I rented that Jesus movie,
  where they beat the shit

        out of Jesus
     for a couple hours.

  Wow, they kicked his ass.

        What happened?

      What, did he key
     somebody's Camaro?

     What did the guy do?

     Look, I didn't like
      the Jesus movie.

      I thought it was
       a shitty movie.

   And people get offended
  when you tell them that,

     like you're saying
      something wrong.

     It's like, "I thought
  the Jesus movie sucked."

      And they're like,
         "Hey, man."

           Like, what?
         He's not in it.

      Who gives a shit?

     Like Jesus cares about
  Mel Gibson's movie, you know.

  Look, I was raised Catholic,
  so I know He did that for me,

     and I appreciate it.

     You know, thank you.

 He should have asked first,
          you know.

     I would have said,
        "I'm all set;

  I don't need that done,"
          because--

    a little presumptuous.

         Only because--
     Look; here's the thing.

    I was raised Catholic,
     and I'm not anymore,

         because they--
     look, if they're right,

        I am fucked;
     I'm going to hell.

             I am,
    because I'm really a--

    I do wrong shit a lot.

       Man, it's really--
  I'm going to hell; I know it.

      And I don't want
        to go to hell,

     and really because
  I don't like new places.

  That's really the reason.

      'Cause I'm afraid
      I'll go to hell,

     I won't know where
     to sign up for shit,

    I'll be all confused--

  like the first day of school,
            you know?

  I wonder, is there, like,
     a schedule to hell?

        How organized
     is your damnation?

     Like, do they first--
 do they put you in one room,

 and some monster fucks you
 up the ass for 1,000 years?

          You come out,
          you're like,

 "They ain't fucking around
    in there, I tell you.

  "I don't recommend that room.

      That was a drag."

 Then they take you and they
  put you in another room,

    and they shit on you--
        or I don't know

        what the fuck
  they're doing down there,

     but what if hell's
       not like that?

  What if I'm just standing
 in a hallway in hell, like,

         "What do I do?
         Where do I go?"

 Some demon walks up to me.

        Hey, [growls].

          And I'm like,
          "Woo! Demon."

     And the demon's like,
  "Come on; suck my dick."

Now I'm blowing a demon in hell,
       and it's horrible.

          I'm thinking,
"I shouldn't have lied so much,"

         or whatever.

     But here's my question:

What if, when I'm done blowing
  the demon in the hallway--

    which, how do you know
       when you're done

         blowing a demon
         in the hallway?

I guess, when he comes fire ants
        on you, whatever.

    When I'm done blowing
  the demon in the hallway,

   what if some guy in charge
of hell walks up to me and goes,

      "Hey, man, you didn't
have to blow that guy, you know.

  "He just hangs out here.

"He's not part of your damnation
          or anything.

 What did you blow him for?"

I just assumed you're supposed
        to blow people.

  He said, "Suck my dick,"
      so I, you know--

        "So, say no.
 What's so hard about that?

             "Jesus.

         "Look, man;
  you better pace yourself.

 "You're down here forever.

     "You're gonna blow
        a lot of demons

      "and elephants--
     all kinds of shit.

  Don't be freelancing in the
hallways, for Christ's sakes."

     And also, you gotta die
         to go to hell,

  and I don't want to die.

         I like my life;
         I'm very happy.

        I'm married,
     and I love my wife.

      I love her very much.

      My wife hates me.

      She fucking hates me.

      She hates me so much.

 Like, that's what she does.

   Like, if you asked her,
  "What did you do today?"

  "I fucking hate that guy;
  that's what I did today.

        I hate Louis."

     She is so mad at me
        all the time.

  Here's the latest thing:
       the other day,

     she got really mad;
       she said to me,

     "You know what you did?

 "You filled the dishwasher
        with dishes,

    you put the soap in,
 and you didn't turn it on."

          And I'm like,
          "Oh, shit.

  What are we going to do now?"

  But here's the part where she
         blows my mind.

        This is amazing
 when she gets to this level.

      She says, "Well,
 why didn't you turn it on?"

     Like I have a reason
    for not turning it on.

        And I'm like,
  "Can't I just be stupid?

      "Can't it just be
  that I'm a fucking idiot,

"that I filled the dishwasher,
    and then I went, 'Duh,'

     and I walked away?"

      I can live with that.

     I'm cool with that.

         But she says,
    "No, why'd you do it?"

      Which means I decided
          not to do it.

   Do you know how much more
 of an asshole that makes me?

     That means I filled
       the dishwasher,

      and then I went,
       "You know what?

           "Fuck her;
     I ain't turning it on."

      "She can suck my dick
          if she thinks

          "I'm pressing
         that On button.

 "I'll fill it, but I don't
      fucking press On;

      not in my own house."

     Why would I do that?

     That would be crazy.

     The thing that she's
 usually mad about is simple.

 She says that I don't listen
 to her when she's talking.

         And I don't,

 but it's not because I don't
  love her, blah, blah, blah;

        it's because--

      I try to listen;
        I really do.

       When she talks,
  I just stare at her face.

     I'm like, "Come on,
      bring the story."

    But somehow, I'm like,
        "What the f--"

        I can't do it;
           I tried.

 'Cause every story gets divided
         into 50 stories

     that all branch out
     into these crazy--

          And I'm like,
          "Holy shit."

         I've got ADD;
        I can't do it.

          I'm like,
      "Fucking please."

         But I try--
      Every time I try,

        because I love
     this retarded woman,

    so I try really hard
  to listen to her stories.

 Other people don't even try.

      We go to parties,
     she starts talking,

 people just walk away like,
         "Fuck this.

     "That lady's crazy.

    Who would waste time
  listening to that crap?"

             Me.

     She can't help it.

 I really feel bad for her,
    because the thing is

  that every word of this story
       gets her so excited

  that she wants to fucking
        run with it.

 She can't fucking just break
  through and get to the end,

    or even the beginning.

     This is my wife telling
            a story:

She's like, "Guess what happened
        to my mom today.

"You remember I told you my mom,
  how when she was in college--

 "Not when she went to Michigan;
      when she transferred.

         "Remember,
  'cause that guy got weird

     "nd she had to leave
        'cause he was--

    "Not the Iranian guy;
 that was a different story.

      "That guy--actually,
     I think he was Persian.

     I heard that Persia
      actually split--"

         What the fuck
    are you talking about?

          Jesus Christ!

          Pick a thing!

    Have some consideration
  for the fucking listener.

      I don't do that.

 Here's me telling a story:

       "I bought a tomato,
 and I ate it, and it was good."

       That's a story
     anyone can follow.

     It's about a tomato
       the whole time.

  I like being married, though.

     I do; I really like it.

         I seriously do.

     We were having sex--
        my wife and I--

    a couple of weeks ago,

      which is amazing,
      that we did that,

 because we never have sex.

            Never.

     Because we have a baby,
and our baby's a fucking asshole

 and won't let us have sex.

 No, fuck--that kid's a jerk,
        man, seriously.

      Every time, she's got
  some urgent shit in her room.

      "Papa, come in here!"

         "I a min--"
           "Now!"

    "Okay." I go in there;
         "What's up?"

     "I need a pair of pants
       to put on my pony."

     [with mock concern]
       Wow. Holy shit.

 I'm trying to fuck your mom
          in there.

      Would you give me
          a break?

  Can't a guy fuck your mom
        for a minute?

      There is no sex, man.

I had no idea that marriage just
          means no sex.

     No, none, fucking none.

I have friends that are thinking
       of getting married,

  and they say funny shit like,

        "Hey, you know,
I don't know if I could do it,

      "because I don't know
      if I could have sex

       with one woman
  for the rest of my life."

           I'm like,
"Don't worry about that shit."

  You're going to have sex
       with zero women

 for the rest of your life.

 That's a lot less than one.

     One woman--who the fuck
      do you think you are?

  Where'd you get that fantasy?

     I'd love to have sex
        with one woman

  for the rest of my life--
       <i> any</i> one woman.

      Big fat dead lady
       with a beard--

     I'd fuck her every day.

  I'd be proud to have her.

     That's not usually
         my problem.

         These days,
 my problem is very simple.

 It's trying to find a place
         in my house

    where I can masturbate
without somebody bothering me.

     And that's getting
      really difficult.

         There's nowhere
         to go anymore.

  She's got her mother staying
 with us too, in the guest room,

 and I'm on the streets now.

     I got nowhere to go.

      Like, now I know,
      when I see a guy

    on the West Side Highway
 jerking off in plain daylight--

 That's not a homeless guy;

     that's a married man
         right there.

     He's got nowhere to go.

     "Fuck it--Fuck you.

  "Go ahead and look, man;
    I got nothing to hide.

 What else am I going to do?"

     It's not fair, man.

  I'm 37 and I own my home.

I should be able to just stand
      in the living room:

      "How you doing honey?

        Good morning."

         But I can't.

      I've got to hide.

    I'm down in the cellar
        by the boiler,

  like a troll down there.

          [growls]

     Just fucking miserable.

         "Oh, shit."

    That's what it's like.

 Masturbation doesn't bring
      much joy to guys.

           Women seem
      to like masturbating.

    They put flower petals
        on the pillow.

          They're like,
"Ah, me," or whatever, you know.

     The guys are like,
         "Ah, shit."

         [muttering]

        "God damn it."

 Sometimes you find ecstasy,
      but it's followed

    by the deepest self-hate
and depression you've ever felt.

      It's an amazing drop
      from way up here to--

    It's like, "Oh, yeah--

     "Oh--what the fuck
      is wrong with me?

          "God damn it.

      "I gotta get to work.

      I don't have time
  for this shit right now."

  But then you get married;
    now you've got to hide.

      And you have to.

      You have to hide.

Because when your wife catches
       you masturbating,

           that's sad
      for the whole family.

         That's not--

      not a good moment
       in a marriage.

  She comes in the cellar:
        "Oh, my God."

  And then she always wants
   to know shit about it.

  She always asks me stuff.

        My wife's like,
 "Well, do you think about me

  when you're doing that?"

          What are you,
          fucking high?

     Why would I do that?

              Why--

 I can think about anybody.

         That's magical.

    Why the fuck would I--
      I'm married to you.

    Do women really think
  their husbands are going,

          "Oh, my wife.
  Oh, yeah, that's fucking hot.

         "Oh, yeah.

"Picking her up at the airport
    and getting yelled at:

  "Oh, that's fucking hot.

            "Yeah.

     "'Put it in the hamper,
     not on top, you idiot.'

         "Oh, I love
  when she talks like that.

            Yeah."

          But you know,
            whatever.

         We're a family;
         we have a kid.

  That changes everything.

     That's the whole thing.

    The kid is everything.

     Marriage is nothing.

       Without a kid,
     marriage is dating.

      It doesn't mean shit.

  And you don't realize it
    till you have a kid.

      Here's what happens:
      when you get married,

     you go, "Holy shit;
     I can't leave now.

            "I mean,
  I wasn't thinking of leaving,

            but now
    I really can't leave."

 Then you have a kid and you go,
  "Holy shit; I could've left."

 I totally could have left.

  Fucking door was right there.

         Now I can't go.

        Got a kid now.

     No, I love my daughter.

 It's a lot of responsibility

 that you never think about,
           though.

      Like, you've got
      to name your kid.

      That's a big deal
        right there.

          And you know
      what's amazing to me?

      You can name your kid
      anything you want.

    Isn't that incredible?

     There are no laws.

        There should be
      a couple of laws.

              None.

        You can literally
     name your kid anything.

 You can name your kid a name
  with no vowels if you want,

        like Pnsndltn.

      Dpppppthfffffffff

          ffffffffffff.

         Just 40 Fs:
      that's his name.

      "Ffffffffffffffffffff
      ffffffffffffffffffff,

     go clean your room."

          [laughs]

 Some people name their kids
    a word, like Sunshine

     or Battery or whatever.

    I'd like to name my kid
  a whole phrase, you know.

         Something like
      Ladies And Gentlemen.

  That would be a cool name
         for a kid.

       "This is my son,
    Ladies And Gentlemen."

Then when he gets out of hand,
         I get to go,

 "Ladies And Gentlemen, please!"

 But you've got to be careful
    what you name your kid.

 You do have to be careful,
  because what happens is,

     other kids in school
are going to make fun of them.

  They're going to make fun
       of their name.

 And you don't have to give them
          a weird name,

    because they can do it
        with any name.

 Kids are geniuses at that.

     Any name--they take it;
      they go Louis Screwy,

         Joey Blowy,

 Mike Your Mother's a Dyke,
          whatever.

      They find a way,
         these kids.

           Any name--
     Like, what's your name?

 Eric--You Fucking Asshole.

     See? Just like that.

         Lightning speed
         these kids got.

      What's your name?

     Joe--Eat a Bag of Shit,
            Cuntface.

  You see? Just like that.

He got that all through school
    and cried like a pussy.

  It's not going to happen
     to my little girl.

      My daughter is really
      something else, man.

 She's--She runs the house.

  She runs the whole house.

     She decides everything.

     Like, we were playing
 hide-and-seek the other day.

    We play hide-and-seek,
  and we play by her rules

     that she invented.

     And do you know why?

      Because she sucks
      at hide-and-seek.

     And so she covers it
    with this fucking ruse

 to level the playing fields.

 And I gotta fucking pretend
         it's all--

      that she's great.

     No, it's bullshit.

      Like, we're playing--

          No, fucking--

     I know she's a kid,
     but fucking listen.

 When it's my turn to hide,
 she tells me where to hide.

     She tells me where.

She goes, "Hide in the closet,
            Papa."

      But you're going
      to know where I--

      "Hide in the closet!"

        All right--fuck--
     I'll hide I the closet.

         Good, fine.

Now I'm standing in the closet
       like an asshole.

         She comes in.
        "I found you."

  She's, like, shitty about it,
      like, "I found you."

     And I'm like, "Wow.

  "How did you figure out where
  you told me to fucking hide?"

  And then when she hides--
     this is her hiding.

     She goes over to a wall
         and does this.

         She goes--

         That's it.

      There's nothing here.

    What the fuck is this?

      Like this is some
 ninja invisibility crouch.

     And I've got to act
       like an idiot.

 I can't just walk in and go,
     "Yeah, you're there."

      'Cause she'll cry
 and shit her pants, right?

 So I've got to walk around
      like an asshole:

        "Where is she?

      "I have no idea.

     Where could she be?"

     I'm making eye contact.

     "I don't see her."

     It's amazing to me.

         The other day,
         we're playing--

This is how things have gotten
      in my house, okay?

 Here's a very good example
     of where it's gone.

     We're playing a version
        of hide-and-seek

  where my wife and I have
     to decide together

         where to look,
     because she likes that.

       She's like, "Mama,
  you tell Papa where to look."

         Okay, fine.

     So she's over there,
       hiding like this,

      just in plain sight,
     and my wife and I are--

My wife's like, "Why don't you
     look under the bed?"

      I'm like, "Okay.

      She's not there."

 And then she says, "Why don't
you look in the linen closet?"

 Okay; so I open the closet.

            She goes,
  "That's not the linen closet.

      We don't put that
     in there anymore."

     All right, fucking--
       Jesus, all right.

     So I look in anoth--

 Why would she be in that closet
        that has shelves?

 She can't stand in a shelf.

 "Well, maybe she's crawled
         in a sh--"

  Now we're having a fight
     about where to look

    for this fucking kid
 who's standing right there.

 She totally runs the house.

     I remember Halloween
          last year--

      A couple of days
      before Halloween,

     my wife comes up to me,
         and she's like,

        [whispering]
     "We have to get you
       a cat costume."

      No, no, we don't,
          actually.

"No, we do, because she thinks
  you're going to be a cat."

     It's like she's got a--

    she's a guy with a gun
      in the other room.

    That's what it's like.

 She's like, "Jess thinks you're
       going to be a cat.

        "I don't know how
     she got it in her head,

    but she's expecting you
 to be a cat on Halloween."

 I just go, "Well, tell her
     to go fuck herself,

 because I'm not doing it."

    I'm not afraid of her.

           She's two;
     I'll fucking fight her.

      I could take her.

   I could beat the shit out
of thousands of two-year-olds.

          All day--
      just walk around.

      They would never even
         gang up on me.

         They suck.

    I'm not afraid of her.

  So my wife decided that she
  wanted to get pregnant again.

         She decided it.

          And she--
  this was back in August.

   She told me, "You need
  to be in town next week."

             Why?

      "Because I'm get--
you know, I'm ovulating, so--"

         Like, not,
 "Do you want another kid?"

     Just, "Be in town;"
 that's how she handles it.

  I'm like, "I'm not going to--
    I don't want another kid,

         so fuck it."

         And she's like,
          "All right."

           Next week,
  she starts blowing me, right?

  Now, she hasn't blown me in--

     Jesus, I don't know
  if I've ever been blown.

    That's how long it is.

      She's blowing me
 on the day she's ovulating.

     I'm a fucking idiot.

           I'm like,
     "Yeah, you love it."

         Like, I think
      she digs me now.

         Fucking stupid.

  So she's having another baby.

     Any day now, she's due.

         It's true.

         She's fucking--

  Fucking--the whole thing.

        And I'm like--

         [muttering]

            "Okay.

     No, no, it's great."

          [laughs]
          Fuck it.

          Fuck it.

  That's really the attitude
  that keeps a family together.

It's not "we love each other;"
      it's "fuck it, man.

          "Fuck it.

          Fuck it."

          Another kid--
            Fuck it.

          Why not?
      Let them all in.

              Good.

          Fuck it.

     But the problem is,
  we have no fucking money.

  I don't know where she thinks
    the money's coming from.

         We're so broke.

 I'm so sick of being broke.

I'm broke all--I'm just always--
  just keep digging this hole.

And most people are broke too;
       that's the thing.

      This country's just--
      everybody's broke.

      That's why I don't--
 Look, I don't like George Bush,

 but I didn't like Kerry either,
         because they're

      fucking both rich,
    and they don't get it.

       They don't know
 what it's like to be poor.

   Like, poor people know
 what it's like to be rich.

      They know exactly
        what it's like,

    because they fantasize
     about it constantly.

   Every poor person has their
whole rich life all planned out.

          Every detail.

     "I'm gonna have a house
       made of chocolate.

 "People are going to blow me
    as I walk in each room.

 "They're gonna be waiting.

  "I'm going to wipe my ass
      with live rabbits

        and throw them
      out the window."

    Got it all worked out.

 But rich people don't fantasize
        about being poor.

        Why the fuck
     would they do that?

 "I'll have to take the bus
     everywhere--yeah!"

    I've always been poor,
        my whole life.

         I've fucking
     never had any money.

     And I--I don't care;
     I don't give a shit.

 But there's a lot of people
     that are poor now.

     Like, I was driving
  through upstate New York,

 and there's people up there,
             man,

 their lives are just shitty.

 Like, you ever drive through
         a whole town,

  and you're like, "What, did a
 shit bomb go off in this place?

         What happened?"

    Everybody's life sucks
      in the whole town.

        And you can tell,
  because they're just standing

 in front of their houses like--

     They're just bleak.

  And a lot of people call
  those people white trash.

              And--

     I love that expression,
         "white trash,"

 because it's the only racial
  expression that you can use

  and nobody gets offended.

     Nobody gives a shit.

 When you say "white trash,"
        nobody goes,

      "Hey, don't talk like
        that about them.

      That's not nice."

 Nobody defends white trash.

You could be talking to the most
  liberal hippie in the world.

  You go, "Hey, I saw this guy;
      he was white trash."

      He'll go, "Ha-ha!
       Fuck that guy.

     White-trash loser."

      No, I don't know;
 I just wanna be a good dad,

     raise my daughter.

 It's a complicated country.

      People get angry,
          you know.

     And everybody hates
       gay people now.

  I never understood anger
     towards gay people,

 because a person being gay
  doesn't affect your life,

       so it's weird to me
     that people just like--

  They're in their homes going,

     "Oh, people are gay.

          Damn it."

      What do you care?

    I can understand hating
  gay people if, say, like,

  you're mowing your lawn,
        and two guys

    are blowing each other
      right on the grass.

  "Oh, I got to cut around
  you faggots every Sunday.

     I'm sick of this shit."

 Or, say you're eating your
  breakfast in the morning,

 and you're about to put your
   spoon in the cereal bowl,

  and two guys touch dicks
    right in front of you.

        "Hey, come on!

      "I gotta get to work.

 "I don't have time to dodge
  your dicks with my spoon.

         Fucking homos--
     get out of my kitchen."

 I hope I'm a better parent
    than my parents were.

          My parents
    were not good parents.

        My parents--
  here's a typical example.

      This is a true story,
         I swear to God.

  My parents sent me to summer
 camp when I was in third grade.

  It's a good idea, right?

        But they didn't
     look into the camps.

       They just chose one
out of the phone book, randomly.

     And I swear to God,
       this happened.

  I get there; it's a camp
    for all retarded kids.

         I swear to God.

       I went to camp
     for retarded kids.

         I swear to God.

      I'll never forget,
      the moment I arrived,

I looked around, and I realized,
          "Holy shit...

        "I'm retarded.

    "I didn't think I was,
        but I must be.

            "How am I
     the only kid who's not?

         "This is how
    they chose to tell me?

         This is it?"

 "Just send him to the camp.

           "Fuck it;
     he'll figure it out.

       He's retarded;
      he's not stupid."

      I loved it there;
        it was great.

       Everybody's nice,
     every game is a tie,

      just gold medals
        for everybody.

         It was awesome.

      Here's the thing:

 I never, never, never, never
   judge other parents now.

         I never do.

 I used to, but I never do.

 Like, you know when you see
   a mother in McDonald's

        or some place
     or in a toy store,

 and she's just melting down
         on her kid?

      She's like, "Shut up.
           I hate you.

          You're ugly."

And people are standing around
   going, "Oh, my goodness.

  She's a horrible mother."

      Well, guess what?

     Those people aren't
      fucking parents.

      They don't have kids.

 'Cause any parents who are
 in that store are thinking,

 "What did that shitty kid do
      to that poor woman?

      "That poor woman.

      I wish I could help."

 'Cause you don't know, man;
       you don't know.

Or like, when you see a parent
  that seems to be negligent.

    Like, you see a parent
         in McDonald's

         with the kid,
    and the parent's like,

        "I can't take
     this shit anymore."

    Just, like, collapsed.

  And all the shopping bags
 are just strewn everywhere.

     And the kid's happy.

The kid's eating french fries.

      And the kid asks
      a question like,

             "Mama,
      why is the sky blue?"

  And she's like, "Just shut up
  and eat your french fries."

       And you think,
  "What a terrible mother.

     "Why doesn't she answer
           her child?

  "When I have a child, I will
  answer all of their questions

      and open their minds
  to the wonders of the world."

      Well guess what:

 you don't know what the fuck
     you're talking about.

      You can't answer
      a kid's question.

  They don't accept any answer.

        A kid never goes,
     "Oh, thanks; I get it."

 They fucking never say that.

    They just keep coming,
        more questions:

      "Why? Why? Why?"

   Till you don't even know
 who the fuck you are anymore

          at the end
     of the conversation.

It's an insane deconstruction.

         It's ama--

     This is my daughter
 the other day; she's like,

           "Papa,
  why can't we go outside?"

 Well, 'cause it's raining.

            "Why?"

      "Well, water's coming
        out of the sky."

            "Why?"

 "Because it was in a cloud."

            "Why?"

     "Well, clouds form
     when there's vapor."

            "Why?"

          I don't know.

          I don't know.
  I don't know any more things.

        Those are all
     the things I know.

            "Why?"

     'Cause I'm stupid,
            okay?

         I'm stupid.

            "Why?"

 Well, because I didn't pay
 attention in school, okay?

        I went to school,
  but I didn't listen in class.

            "Why?"

      'Cause I was high
        all the time.

    I smoked too much pot.

            "Why?"

       'Cause my parents
     gave me no guidance.

  They didn't give a shit.

            "Why?"

     'Cause they fucked
     in a car and had me,

      and they resented me
     for taking their youth.

            "Why?"

 Because they had bad morals.

  They just had no compass.

             "Why?"
 'Cause they had shitty parents.

     It just keeps going
         like that.

    "Why?" 'Cause fuck it;
 we're alone in the universe.

     Nobody gives a shit
          about us.

  I'm gonna stop here to be
 polite to you for a second.

 But this goes on for hours
         and hours.

     And it gets so weird
         and abstract.

    At the end, it's like,
            "Why?"

Well, because some things are,
   and some things are not.

            "Why?"

     Well, because things
    that are<i> not</i> can't<i> be.</i>

            "Why?"

     Because then nothing
         wouldn't be.

    You can't have fucking
        "nothing isn't,

         everything is."

            "Why?"

  'Cause if nothing wasn't,
     there'd be fucking

      all kinds of shit
        that we don't--

 like, giant ants with top hats,
         dancing around.

        There's no room
     for all that shit.

             "Why?"
          Oh, fuck you!

    Eat your french fries,
       you little shit.

         God damn it!

     Thank you very much,
          everybody.

         Good night.
         Thank you.
