<i>â™ª Somehow it seems</i>
<i>The love I need â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is always</i>
<i>The most destructive kind â™ª</i>

â™ª Yesterday, when I was young

â™ª The taste of life was sweet â™ª

â™ª As rain upon my tongue â™ª

<i>â™ª I'd teased at life â™ª</i>

â™ª As if it were a foolish game â™ª

â™ª The way the evening breeze â™ª

â™ª May tease a candle flame â™ª

<i>â™ª The thousand dreams</i>
<i>I dreamed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The splendid things</i>
<i>I planned â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I always built to last</i>
<i>On weak and shifting sand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I lived by night</i>

â™ª And shunned the naked light
<i>Of day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And only now I see</i>
<i>How the time ran away â™ª</i>

â™ª Yesterday, when I was young â™ª

â™ª So many lovers' songs â™ª

â™ª Were waiting to be sung â™ª

<i>â™ª So many wild pleasures</i>
<i>Lay in store for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And so much pain</i>
<i>My eyes refused to see â™ª</i>

â™ª There are so many songs in me
<i>That won't be sung â™ª</i>

â™ª I feel a bitter taste of tears
<i>Upon my tongue â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The time has come â™ª</i>

â™ª For me to pay for yesterday

DAMON: [ON PHONE]
<i>It's not my fault</i>

you make me think bad thoughts.

Oh, right.
You're so innocent.

I'm totally leading you
down a dark path of corruption.

DAMON: [LAUGHS] You're right.

If I crash and burn
on my test today,

that's on you.

Oh, yeah.

I forgot
you have your PSATs today.

Are you ready?

DAMON: How can I be ready

with you taking up
all my study time?

Ha-ha.

You're gonna do awesome.

Then maybe we can
celebrate tonight?

Can you get away
from the parental units?

I'll have
to make something up,

but you know
how creative I can be.

Mom says to get
your ass out of bed.

Jesus! Knock, please!

Oh, my God! I will kill you!

REPORTER: [ON TV] <i>...several</i>
<i>reports of police staying</i>

and also near Cornell Street.

<i>Witnesses tell us</i>

<i>the driver calmly exited</i>
<i>the vehicle</i>

just moments before the impact

And reports that the woman

was in fact the child's mother
<i>could not be verified.</i>

Good Lord, really?
Before breakfast?

Oh, sorry, Ms. Ryan.

See that, Josh?

Always do what Mom says.

-[IMITATES TRUCK ENGINE]
-JOSH: No! No! No! No!

[IMITATES EXPLOSION]

So not funny.

-Awful.
-[STIFLING LAUGHTER]

Hey, uh, can I go to a movie
with Riley tonight?

-[MOCKING] "With Riley."
-CARLY: Shut up.

Since when does anyone
under 30 go to the movies?

Sweetheart,
you're not seeing that boy.

Well, he has a name,

and I know why you don't want me
to see him.

BRENT: Yeah,
because he's a junior,

and you're a sophomore.

Listen, I used to be
a 17-year-old dude once,

-so I think I know--
-Dad, gross!

-Gross?
-CARLY: Yeah.

Honey, your grandparents
are coming

-for dinner tonight, remember?
-Wh-- Mom, really?

-Really.
-[SIGHS]

What? You haven't seen them
in months,

and they're not getting
any younger, you know,

so the "movie" can wait.

Awesome!

You and Grandma
passive-aggressive

bitching at each other,

and Grandpa telling
his disgusting Vietnam stories.

"Pulled it out
and killed the Charlie bastard

-with his own pigsticker."
-[MOUTHING SILENTLY]

Carly! I am so sorry.

<i>M gan yiu,</i> Mrs. Ryan.

I'm the Chinese.

Chinese is not the Charlie.

Well, I'm already
on the rag anyway, and I--

I can't hear you!

Hashtag,
inappropriate talk before--

-"Hashtag"?
-BRENT: Son, you take my advice.

Don't ever have kids.

Oh, oops!

[SPEAKING CANTONESE]
...Mr. Ryan.

-It's too late.
-This is bullshit!

Okay, Carly,

that is enough, young lady!

So nothing about Jeannie yet?

No. No baby news yet.
Soon, soon, soon.

This is so weak.
I can already see

how this is gonna go down.

Aunt Jeannie's gonna
have her kid today,

out of all days,

and you're going to be
the no-show for dinner.

I--

You know, I want to trust you,
Carly. Really...

I do.

Your dad and I both do,
but you don't make it easy

on us when you shut us out.

[CARLY SIGHS]

Do you mind not Facebooking
when we're driving together?

It's really
the only time we have,

just the two of us.

"Facebooking."

You know what I mean.

Yeah, whatever.

You know, I really, really hate
when you say that.

[CARLY EXHALES]

Amazing. I mean,

everything just revolves
around you, doesn't it?

Doesn't everyone's world
revolve around themselves?

Who else
should it revolve around?

Well,

you're part of a family, Carly,
and that means

that you love each other

even when
you can't stand each other,

and that you give a shit

even when you don't really give
a shit. [LAUGHS]

Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense, Mom.

Take your Aunt Jeannie,
for instance.

I mean, you could have
a new cousin today.

That is a big deal.

And all you can think about is--

I don't even know

what you're thinking about,

because you don't tell me
anymore.

We used to be best friends,
remember?

Okay. Well, that's not the case
anymore, Mom.

I have other friends.

Right.

See, it's just, for me,
you and Josh are everything.

So you don't get
to just shut me out.

Okay, it's not fair.

God, it's not my fault
you have no life!

[CARLY SIGHS]

You know what?

You're right.

Whatever.


Stop it! Stop it!

-BRENT: Had enough?
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

No! No! Ow!

BRENT: All right, Sun-Yi.

Thanks for everything.
We'll see you next week.

JENNA: We are so over.

-I'm dying.
-Why do we do it?

Killing ourselves
to hold back Father Time

for what, a few more months?
Why do anything? I don't know.

Be healthy, I guess.

Be healthy, my ass.
It's not about being healthy.

It's about being hot,

and hot, skinny bitch,
is in our rear-view mirror.


I mean,
don't get me wrong.

Look at you.
You're amazing.

But that's not what
keeps your hubby

from chasing
after 17-year-olds.

It's state divorce law
that does that shit.

Yeah, if it weren't for that
juicy hunk of asada

in the front row,
I would not be keeping up

with this torture.

Okay, you know he could
sue you for sexual harassment

for shoving your business
in his face.

Are you kidding me?
He is making his way

through that class
like a stomach flu.

I'm just hoping
he gets to my row

before I have a massive coronary
and peace out, yo.

[MOUTHING SILENTLY]

Your sister,

she's gonna pop one out, huh?

Yeah, good luck with that.

God, I need a real drink.

I saw Riley changing in front
of the mirror the other day,

and I started to hate her
a little.

She's my daughter.
I should be proud,

but all I could think was,
"One day,

those tits are gonna drop,
you little whore."

-Is that wrong?
-That's funny.

-I could have sworn--
-What?

That I got 100
from the ATM yesterday.

Oh, don't worry
about it. I got this.

Yeah.
No, it's just weird.

I don't know
what I could have done with it.

I don't know
about your little angels,

but mine steals from me
every chance she gets.

-No.
-She's a bitch.

Does anybody know
what this means?

Anyone? Bueller? No?

It refers to products designed

with a predetermined,
limited life span.

Products that are
literally built to die,

that is, to become unfashionable

or nonfunctional
in a certain amount of time.

-See exhibit A.
-Excuse me.

That's actually
the new one.

You are dexterously
missing my point,

and making it at exactly
the same time.

See, the idea is to manipulate

-the consumer...
-[STUDENTS LAUGHING]

...to constantly want to buy

-the new one.
-Yeah, duh.

Of course, there's
an argument to be made

in favor of--
What's this? What is it?

-Planned obsolescence.
-STUDENTS: Planned obsolescence.

That's right.
Without getting rid of the old,

you might never embrace the new.

[PHONE RINGING]

The need
to continuously replace,

it forces us
to accelerate progress.

The same thing
can happen in nature.

Hold that thought.

Yep?

Sure.

PeÃ±a, you need to go
to the office.

Where was I?
You were saying how we were

the new and improved version
of last year's class.


-[PHONE RINGING]
-Oh.

Really?

Yes?

-[SIRENS WAILING]
-Okay.

-[TIRES SCREECH]
-I understand.

All right.

Jenson... they need you
in the office, too. I'm sorry.

What's going on?

Chapter 12.
Everyone, let's go. Come on.

Problem?

[DAMON SIGHS]

What's the rush today?

We still have over an hour.

Look at 'em.

Looks like they're waiting
for a buffet.

My mom is such a penis.
She is killing me.

She just won't let go
of that shit last weekend.

I'm totally cut off.
No credit, no ATM.

Can't even get any
of my birthday money.

-Can't you ask your dad?
-Nah.

He direct deposits
in my account.

It's not like he can just fly in
and drop me a hundo.

He's in, like, Europe
or something.

I don't know.
Fuck that dude.

-[TOILET FLUSHES]
-Besides, I got you, fam.

Seriously, you're not gonna
wash your hands?

Oh.

...was an isolated incident
is apparently far from it,

across the country.

<i>We can hardly believe</i>
<i>what we are reporting to you</i>

<i>based on the videos</i>
<i>that are flooding in,</i>

<i>and we want to warn you,</i>
<i>this footage is very graphic.</i>

[CHILD GAGGING]

-Hey, you want a drink, bitch?
-Yeah.

I mean, fuck no!
Dude, get in here!

ANCHOR: [CONTINUES]
But what we know is this.

-What the fuck?
<i>-Multiple incidents</i>

are being reported
of parents attacking...

and, in many cases,
murdering their own children.

Riley!

RILEY: Mom?

Are you okay?

I spilled my drink.

DR. OZ: [ON TV] <i>I'm sure</i>
<i>many viewers are unfamiliar</i>

<i>with a phenomenon</i>
<i>known as "savaging."</i>

It's actually somewhat common
in the animal kingdom.

For instance,
in a domestic pig population,

as anyone involved in raising
livestock will tell you--

ANCHOR: Excuse me.
You are talking about pigs?

There are children dying,
and you're talking about pigs.

Well, yes. In fact,
around 50 percent

of the piglet fatalities seen
is due to the mother attacking

or crushing
the newborn pre-weaned babies,

and no one can say
exactly why they do it.

[RILEY GROANS]

ANCHOR: [ON TV] <i>Again, we have</i>
<i>to emphasize, we have no idea</i>

NURSE: [ON PA] <i>Dr. Torres,</i>
<i>please dial...</i>

ANCHOR: [ON TV] <i>All right,</i>
<i>but isn't it a fact</i>

that we still have no real idea
<i>what is causing this?</i>

MAN: [ON TV] <i>It could be</i>
<i>a natural phenomenon,</i>

<i>but let's just postulate</i>
<i>someone wants to wipe us out,</i>

<i>so they create</i>
<i>a biological weapon</i>

or a neurotoxin which attacks
a very hard-wired human impulse,

which is to protect our young.

Any parent would rush out
in front of a speeding car,

<i>or an oncoming train</i>
<i>or even a wild animal</i>

<i>to save their child,</i>
<i>but if you could take</i>

that natural human impulse
<i>and reverse it,</i>

you wouldn't have
to wipe us out,

because at that point,
we ourselves

would be wiping out
our own future.

All right, let's do this fast.
We're gonna go in.

We're gonna get
your little brother,

and get the hell out, okay?

Okay.

[MOP SPLASHING]

CARLY: Sun-Yi?

Carly, you're home.

Why you not at school?

We left early today.

SUN-YI: Okay. Come here.
I make you the lunch.

That's your boyfriend?

Mr. Ryan say no boyfriend
in the house.

You understand me?
[SPEAKS IN CANTONESE]

We're only here for a minute,
okay? Uh, where's Joshua?

In his room.

I don't know
why he's not come out.


[SPEAKING CANTONESE]

I can't get this stain
out of the floor!

No, you need-- you need--
you need to leave, okay?

You need to go right now.

I clean the mess,
and then I go.

No! You need
to leave right now!

Don't worry about the cleaning!
Just get out of the house!

-DAMON: Go get your brother.
-CARLY: Get out!

[CARLY GASPING]

You want the lunch, kid?

I'm good.

Everybody so crazy today.

I don't understand
why they so crazy today.

I don't clean the kitchen.

I don't know
who's clean the kitchen.

[SPEAKING CANTONESE]

[DOOR SHUTS]

CARLY: <i>Josh?</i>

Where are you, bro?

Hey, are you okay?


JOSH: Lisa.

Something bad happened to Lisa.

I know. I know. I know.

In Chinese... I didn't--
She didn't do anything wrong.

-I know, okay? I know.
-Why'd she do it?

Just listen to me.
I know. I know you're scared.

But we have
to get out of the house

before Mom and Dad come home.

It's not what you think,
Mr. Ryan.

What are you doing

Is my daughter here?

Carly? Joshua?

Is that Dad? I want Dad.

No, we have to leave,
God damn it.

-I need to get my backpack.
-Why?

Fine. Just get it.

Mr. Ryan, we--
we need to talk, sir.

Oh, do we need to talk?

Yeah, we do need to talk.
You can't be here.

This is not about me and Carly.

-It's about what's happening.
-I get exactly...


It's called hormones.

Shh.

Yeah, believe it or not,

-Mr. Ryan--

But now...

the world you kids

the things you've seen

mouth to dildo,

Hi, Brent, anal beads,

-KENDALL: Wow!


You were gonna tell me
about this at some point?

Jesus Christ.

Why do you sneak up on me
like that?

You bought a pool table?

Yeah. So?

You don't even like pool.

Can I ask how much this cost?

Don't worry about it.

I kind of have to worry
about it.

I mean,
Christmas is coming up.

Do you really think
this is the right time

to start building a man cave
in the basement?

It's not a man cave, Kendall.

Jesus!

I just thought, you know,
like-- like a family room.

The whole house
is a family room.

Okay. You see, I got a problem
with that one right there,

because I bust my ass six days
a week

trying to pay this place down,

and it's like
a fucking obstacle course

trying to get out
the fucking front door.

I mean, one of these days,
I'm gonna trip over

one of Josh's toys
and take a nose dive

-straight to the emergency room.
-What are you saying?

I'm saying that maybe we need
to have boundaries.

I'm saying that
maybe there needs to be

a fucking grown-up zone,
and a fucking kid zone!

Brent... honey...

you think I want to be the one

to piss all over
your family room?

I want to be the one

who has to build
a fucking family room?

Perfect. Yeah.

Okay. Well,

let me see if I can take care
of this for you, sweetheart.

Yeah, I think I have something.
I have just the right thing.


Oh, yeah!

â™ª You put your right foot in

â™ª You take your right foot out â™ª

â™ª You do the hokey-pokey â™ª

<i>â™ª And you fuckin'</i>
<i>Work it all out â™ª</i>

-[GROANS]
-KENDALL: Brent, stop.

And you do the hokey-pokey,

and you turn yourself around!


That's what it's all about!


There you go.

Problem solved.

You're right, honey.
I hate pool.


Not a big fan
of machine-part sales either.

Trying to hit quotas
down there, be a big man.

Not exactly what I had in mind
as a young dude, you know.

Bright future. Everything
in the world to look forward to.

I mean, I was gonna grab
the world by the balls

and squeeze, boy!

God damn it! I remember
that kid I used to be

like it was
four fucking minutes ago!

My feet barely touched
the ground back then.

My kill ratio
was nine out of ten!

It was 100 percent sex.

But that guy, in a million years
could never have pictured

this tired motherfucker
he turned out to be!

Flat on his ass,
fat, bald,

cottage-cheese fucking ass,

Blue Bonnet butter
waistline,

with hair coming out
of my ears, my nose.

And my salary went
from 145,000 dollars

to 45,000 dollars!

Yeah, building
a fucking man cave!

That's right.

You're right!


I mean,
does any of this make any sense

to you at all?

Of course it does.

I mean...

it's not that...

as a woman...

you don't have...

career dreams,

relationship dreams.

I did. I had all that...

but there's this bigger thing.

All your life,
you know it's coming.

And there's this mix
of anxiety and...

secret excitement...

and terror...

because you know that one day...

inevitably...

you'll create this life.

The hugeness of it,
the importance of it...

everything is building
to that moment.

And then...

it happens.

And no matter what you thought
it would be...

it's not like that.

I mean, it's intense.

It's fucking bat-shit,
but it's not...

It doesn't...


Anyways, it is what it is.

Just something that happens,
and then it's...

Then it's over.

KENDALL: Yeah.

I know this is the way
things are supposed to be.

I-- I know we're doing it right.

my head around, you know?

I mean, I used to be Brent...

and you used to be Kendall...

and now we're just...

Mom and Dad.

Really?

Well, I mean, some psycho
could break into the house.

How am I supposed to defend us?

You do realize

involve firearms!

It was in a locked case.

What was the combination?

Josh's birthday.

Who wants to die today?

Speak! Speak!

Just alcohol. Okay.

No! No. Leave it.

I think
they only want to hurt us.

Don't worry.

You were never good enough
for him.

You're a whore.

Kendall's not even a real name!


Dad, what are you doing?

No! Dad!


you fucked up, son...

but what if I told you
I fucked up even worse?

-How?
-Did you know

that once upon a time,

the Firebird
was Grandpa Mel's car?

It's true.
He bought it brand-new in '79

right off the line,
used his V.A. settlement.

Man, that car was his baby.

When I was little,
I used to watch him

polish it on the front lawn
every weekend.

And by the time I turned
into a dumb,

horny, pimple-faced
high school kid

just like you're gonna be,
it was officially a classic.

So long story short,
I stole the keys,

picked up my girlfriend.

Yeah,
this is before I met your mom.

Took it out for a little spin.

-[TIRES SCREECHING]
-[TRUCK HORN HONKING]

Pretty much totaled
the motherfucker.

-Cool.
-[CHUCKLES]

Well, Mel didn't think so.

I thought
he was gonna crush my skull.

But you know what he did?

He sold it to me.
And it wasn't cheap either.

I'd have to pay him back
every dime he put into it.

And if I wanted
to drive my senior year,

I better learn how to fix a car.
So I did.

I spent the whole summer
working two jobs,

paid back my dad.
"Here's ten dollars, Dad.

Here's 20 dollars, Dad.
Here's 100 dollars, Dad."

By the end of the summer,

I had that bad boy cherried out
from the ground up.

Now, you talk
about a pussy magnet.

-Dad.
-Chick magnet. [CHUCKLES]


Your mom keeps telling me
to sell it,

but I just can't bear
to let her go.

Is that why Mom always says,

"I can't bear to think
about what must have happened

in that car"?

Because of the accident?

No, no, buddy. Nah.

She's talking
about something else.

I'm sorry I messed up, Dad.

Hey...

like father, like son, right?

But if you ever
touch that car again...

I'll fuckin' kill you.

-[GROANS]
-Dad!
