EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
There are few who

speak of the eerie
happenings that

once prowled in this
quiet corner of the state.

The truth can be stranger
and more horrifying than what

any man will dream up.

[frantic music]

I always looked
after my brother.

He'd say it was not needed.

But that's where he'd be wrong.

[downbeat music]

The government was giving away
free land to anyone who could

live through five winters.

I claimed mine.

But my brother, he
wasn't interested.

the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
He said he was

the only doctor for 100 miles.

He took his work to heart.

Oh, my.

MRS. THOMAS: Is it serious?

WILLIAM: Not if it is cared for.

A little poultice will help.

Now I want you to rub this
on your foot every morning.

MRS. THOMAS: Thank you.

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Everybody
tried to fix him up,

but my brother didn't
want to be held.

After he lost his wife
in her childbirth,

he made his way alone.

We're lucky.

Lucky to have such a fine
physician in our town.

You speak generously.

MRS. THOMAS: You deserve more.

Your brother too.

Do you know my niece, Ethel?

WILLIAM: I do not
believe that I do.

Oh, you must.

She's lovely, doctor.

I'm expecting her.

She'll be here any moment.

Wouldn't you like to stay?

Have a cup of coffee?

Thank you, Mrs. Thomas, but I
have many people to see today.

I'm sure you have.

Strange things have
been happening lately.

Mm-hmm.

You did hear about
Mrs. Kimball's nephew?

In Cherry Vale?

He was expected.

Expected here last
Sunday supper.

They found his horse
yesterday two miles away.

[downbeat music]

Oh, here she is.

Won't you stay a moment?

Say hello, doctor?

WILLIAM: I thank
you kindly, but I...

I really must be on my way.

Good day, ladies.

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: I
never understood him,

with his logic and his books.

But I loved him.

He taught himself to cook.

Pork was his favorite.

I reckon because it was easiest.


Time to start
preparing supper, Betsy.

Should I go pull some
grains from the garden too?


MR. LONCHER: Get the doctor!

Betsy, go get the doctor!

BETSY: Doctor!

[bell ringing]

Mrs. Loncher?

Mrs. Loncher, I
must sit you upright

in order to help you breathe.

[bone snapping]

Ma!

[downbeat music]

MR. LONCHER: Lily!

She must have struck
her head as she fell.

She was suffocating,
so I adjusted her.

I'm sorry.

I will fetch the parson.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: It's
hard to keep people alive.

You have to feed
them, keep them clean,

and you really
ought to love them.

MAN: Good evening, doctor.

Every time someone passes,
I think about my late husband.

Sometimes you don't
realize how important

someone is till they're gone.

Oh, you understand.

Your manner's seen tragedy.

Yes.

I do understand.

Biscuits?

MR. LONCHER: Take a
letter from me, doctor.

Mother, we are leaving
Independence to be with you.

Mr. Loncher, don't you
think you and Betsy would

be better off staying here?

The Osage trail is
notoriously dangerous.

[door slamming]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: He
lived for his patients.

But he was losing
more than he saved.

Mournful solemnities of this day

may awaken us to righteousness.

Let us not forget that our
days are swiftly passing away.

And that every hour
shortens our scanty span.

Give us grace to live...

BETSY: [humming] [SINGING]
Come fill up my cup

and fill up my can.

Come saddle my horses
and call out my men.

Unhook the West
Port and let us go

free, for it's up with the
bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Even in
all those wide open spaces,

things can disappear.

[downbeat music]

BETSY: [SINGING] Fill up
my cup and fill up my can,

come saddle my horses
and call out my men.

Unhook the West Port
and let us go free.

[downbeat music]

the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

WOMAN [VOICEOVER]:
Dear George and Betsy,

hope you have not
left Independence.

I am anxious with
worry about you.

Send word as soon
as you read this.

You are in my constant prayers.

Mother.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: I
don't know why he left.

Maybe to find those people.

Maybe to save someone again.

Maybe he didn't think he
had that much to lose.

Maybe he was right.

[downbeat music]

MAN: Afternoon, sir.

Good afternoon.

By any chance, you
seen a man traveling

with a little girl in a wagon?

Can't say that I have.

Be the first person
I seen in a while.

Well, I thank you all the same.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: He
must have gone a ways.

He must have gone
without eating.

Worked up quite an appetite.

And then he saw that sign.

Grocry.

He believed in signs.

[knocking at door]

Good afternoon, ma'am.

I saw your sign.

ELVIRA: You need groceries?

Yes, ma'am.

For my horse.

We have corn.

And here's oats.

WILLIAM: Some oats, please.

Have you by any
chance seen a man

traveling with a little girl?

ELVIRA: A man traveling
with a little girl?

Yes, ma'am.

No.

I haven't seen them.

WILLIAM: Of course not.

Are you from Independence?

WILLIAM: Yes, ma'am, I am.

What is your name?

I am Dr. William York.

Doctor?

WILLIAM: I was an assistant
surgeon during the war.

Here are my credentials.

I do not read.

I know what it's
like to lose someone.

You don't settle a country like
this without losing people.

You of all people should know,
bad things happen on the Osage.

Bandits steal the fat
wallets of travelers.

The many who wander off
the trail and never found.

Why, I've heard of
nine disappearances

already this year.

In the dark, you won't find the
people that you're looking for.

Go to Independence tomorrow.

Safely.

[william's stomach growling]

all have to eat.

Yes, ma'am, we all have to eat.

All right then, thank you.

Lodging is $0.15.

And supper is $0.10.

Of course.

Please, sit down.

Thank you, kindly.

ELVIRA: There you are.

Doctor, let me introduce
you to my daughter, Kate.

This is Dr. York.

Isn't she a lovely girl?

Yes, she is.

ELVIRA: And very wise.

People come from miles
around just to see Kate.

[downbeat music]

You and I may have quite
a lot in common, Dr. York.

WILLIAM: How is that?

I too am a healer.

Really?

KATE: The body
holds many secrets

hidden beneath the skin.

They seem mysterious,
but they can be

unearthed by the right person.

You're very perceptive, miss.

Medicine is the craft of
looking from the outside

and seeing within.

Even the most basic
forces keeping us alive,

we cannot see them, yet
we know they are there.

What are you thinking of?

Pulse, for example.

May I?

[downbeat music]

KATE: You are right, Dr. York.

I understand.

I am one who has the
power to see many things,

the future, the past.

I help others find answers
to their mysteries,

and I bring them
health and happiness.

I could be useful if you're
searching for missing people.

My profession is one of
science, not the supernatural.

My apologies if I have offended.

Kate, the doctor is
apologizing to you.

Be a kind hostess.

You are forgiven, doctor.


Is he your son?

Brother.

WILLIAM: One, two, three.

One, two, three.

Very good.

[downbeat music]

My father taught me that
when I was a little boy.

You see, you can do it too, son.


Very good.

Good evening, sir.

Hello.

ELVIRA: Dr. York,
you are our guest.

Please, sit in
the seat of honor.

WILLIAM: You are most kind.

You met Kate?

WILLIAM: Yes, I met Kate.

She's a beauty, no?

No?

Yes.

She is lovely.

ELVIRA: Time to eat.

Do you enjoy pork, sir?

WILLIAM: Of course.

ELVIRA: [humming]

KATE: Hungry?

WILLIAM: Very.

Where's the pork?

ELVIRA: Almost ready.


WILLIAM: [gasps]

[frantic music]



[door slamming]

[heavy breathing]

[ominous music]

There will be others, Kate.

KATE: I thought he
would understand.

He almost did.

But he mocked me.

That was his mistake, not yours.

KATE: I want another chance.

Then you shall have one.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Even in
Kansas, a man has to eat.

But the food don't
grow on trees.

Somebody had to live there.

Somebody had to work that soil.

But first, somebody had to die.

WOMAN: Kate!

Miss Bender!

Kate!

Kate!

Miss Bender.


I want to thank you for helping
us out so much last week.

You found your goats?

They were crossing
that creek right

by that real big cottonwood
at exactly half past noon,

just like you said.

I couldn't believe my eyes.

How'd you know that?

How'd you know where they're be?

Consider it my gift.

But see, my husband and I,
we had spent the better part

of two days looking for them.

He thought I was a fool when
I gave you a nickle to listen.

But now, all that
bellyaching's over.

He couldn't be happier.


I am glad you found your goats.

You... you are no ordinary girl.

I thank you.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: They must
have kept up a good act.

Maybe that was it.

It was all an act.

Rehearsed.

[downbeat music]


Boy!

Boy!

Come here.

Here, boy.

JOHN JUNIOR: [humming]

[ominous music]

JOHN: [groans]

Move.


[downbeat music]

ELVIRA: [sighs]

What are you doing, boy?

Gardening?


Look, look, little green apples.

Apples!


[downbeat music]

Hello, dear.

[downbeat music]

It's Sunday.

We have all day to
do as we please.

What's the matter with you?

You ain't young like Kate.


Remember who feeds you.

JOHN JUNIOR: Here, piggies.

Hey.

You done her yet?

Ah, pig, you go do her.

Pig!

What'd you do, boy?

Huh?

Huh?

Pig!

Pig!


[ominous music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Unnatural things

happened out on the Osage.

Was it some sort of a joke?

We now know it was a
grave joke they told.

ELVIRA: That's plenty.


Don't worry, Kate.

You'll find someone
who sees your gift.

Supper?

KATE: Yes, ma'am.

[downbeat music]

Come back to me.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: They chase
each other, life and death.

Feeding, going hungry,
the circle of our days.

Ethel!

Ethel!

ETHEL: What is it,
Auntie, are you all right?

My toe.

ETHEL: Haven't you
been treating it?

Oh, of course I've
been treating it,

but I ran out of
poultice two days ago,

and the doctor's been away.

I have to go inside.

Ethel, go get the doctor.

He must be back by now.

Yes, Auntie.

[downbeat music]



[heavy breathing]

Mmm.

JOHN: [groans]

JOHN JUNIOR: [hums]

[downbeat music]

[horse approaching]

ELVIRA: Good afternoon.

Good afternoon, ma'am.

ELVIRA: Would you like
to buy some groceries?

OFFICER: No, no thank you.

I would like to speak
with your husband.

About what?

Another disappearance,
I'm afraid.

A doctor.

Maybe you could be of help
in tracing his whereabouts.

No.

No, I haven't seen anyone.

OFFICER: Let me
describe him to you.

Yes, of course.

OFFICER: Dr. William York.

About 40 years of age.

Healthy, dark hair, riding a
bay horse about 15 hands high.

No.

I haven't seen any doctor.

Do you have many people
come by here, ma'am?

ELVIRA: What do you mean?

Do many people stop here?

For groceries?

Yes, ma'am.

For groceries.

Well, do they?

Yes.

Have you seen any man fitting
the description of Dr. York?

ELVIRA: No, I haven't.

ELVIRA: Why, a pocket
watch, of course.

That's mighty extravagant
out here on the Osage.

It belonged to my
father before he passed.

It's our most prized possession.

Mayor Prentiss is holding
a meeting in Cherry Vale

tomorrow about these
disappearances.

I would encourage
your family to attend.

ELVIRA: Oh, I think
that would be very wise.

Thank you for letting us know.

Good day.

[ominous music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Hunger has a way

of clouding a man's judgment.



EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: The tall
grass hides half itself.

For every foot you see,
another foot lies below.


EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Dozens of people had

vanished around these parts.

Dozens of people had
visited the Benders.

[crowd murmuring]

[door banging]

I called this meeting to discuss

the disturbing disappearances
happening in our midst.

These are not the misfortunes of
wayward travelers or transients

from afar, but established
families, respected men,

local people have
vanished in fair weather,

swallowed by the prairie that
we know to fear and respect.

Some blame the devil.

Some have been heard
whispering of their neighbors.

We can no longer think of these
events as unlucky coincidence.

Citizens from this county have
been taken by an evil lurking

outside our door.

We must protect each other.

Remember how we struggled to
settle this land, what we lost,

who we lost.

Never forget those that we
buried along the journey,

for their souls live on
in us and in our children.

We have nothing if we cannot
keep our loved ones safe.

So in the name of those that
are absent from this room

we must fight against any
danger posed to our families.

I ask to come forward any
man brave enough to search

out the root of this terror.

That's right, Mayor.

And I don't know why Sheriff...

Calm down, Charles.

We'll get to the bottom of this.

MAN: We've gotta get
somebody out there.

MAN: Sheriff.

[interposing voices]

WOMAN: Where are my children?

WOMAN: What happened
to my family?

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: A bender
is a force of nature.

Just as sure as the dirt is
the death beneath our feet.

[downbeat music]

Like a sunrise, like a sunset,
we come from each other.

Each life built on
another's death.

[knocking at door]

[suspenseful music]

EDWIN: Good afternoon, ma'am.

ELVIRA: Good afternoon.

I hope I have not
come at a bad time.

No.

No.

Would you like to
buy some groceries?

No, ma'am.

I come looking for someone.

His name is Dr. William York.

Might you know anything
that could be of help?

No, I don't believe I do.

But perhaps my daughter, Kate,
could be of some assistance

to you.

Kate?

Kate, we have a visitor.

Let me present to you Mr?

York.

Mr. York.

KATE: How do you do, Mr. York?

EDWIN: Pleased to meet you.

I wonder if you
have by any chance

run across a doctor
from Independence?

What is your reason
for inquiring, Mr. York.

I am his brother.

KATE: Of course you are.

What do you think
happened to your brother?

I really couldn't say.

Nobody would leave me,
but I have the strangest

feeling he simply vanished.

I believe you, Mr. York.

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Fraternal
and identical ain't the same,

but it's close enough in Kansas.

KATE: I think I can
help you, Mr. York.

EDWIN: Call me Edwin.

KATE: I will call you
whatever you like, Edwin.

I'm reached by many forces.

While others see only to the
horizon, I can see just beyond.

No place is out of my sight.

No soul is out of my reach.

Your brother is an honest man.

I can feel it.

EDWIN: Yes, he is.

KATE: Hard worker.

EDWIN: A very hard worker.

KATE: Caring to his patients.

So caring that he traveled
the trail for them,

though guilt troubled his soul.

EDWIN: Do you see him?

Do you see my brother?

It is fading.

It is gone.

EDWIN: Gone?

Yes.

I have lost it.

How do you do that?


These here are Missouri pippins.

Why, yes.

Yes, they are.

Do you tend this orchard?

My father does.

He does well.

We are an industrious people.

[suspenseful music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: She
thought she was a seer.

But she could only see
me in my brother's place.

What a mess.

Would you walk me
to the creek, Edwin?

Of course.

KATE: [HUMS "WHEN JOHNNY COMES
MARCHING HOME"]

[gentle music]

EDWIN: How long has it been
since you staked this claim?

KATE: We settled it three
years ago this fall.

EDWIN: Has it treated you well?

KATE: The animals are
healthy and the soil is good,

but we don't have much,
beside a couple of pigs.

And the apples.

Where's your land, Edwin?

EDWIN: Outside Fort Scott.

KATE: But you were
not born there?

EDWIN: No.

I come from Illinois.

I took my wound at
Chickamauga, then

I bought my land after the war.

KATE: Are you not married?

EDWIN: No.

Not yet, no.

KATE: You will be.

One day.

EDWIN: What is your family name?

KATE: Bender.

EDWIN: Bender.

That name is unusual.

Sounds like a force of nature.

KATE: Oh, we are.

I will be right back.

[downbeat music]

Good evening, Mr. York.

EDWIN: Good evening, ma'am.

Come in.

Please, come in.

You had an enjoyable
walk with Kate?

No?

Yes.

It was quite enjoyable.

The bed is very comfortable.

You'll sleep well there tonight.

The blankets are warm,
and the pillows soft.

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
Everything said welcome.

Everything in place.

They wanted me to feel at home.

They wanted to feed me.

ELVIRA: She's a beauty.

Indeed.

Do you have a
travel bag, Mr. York?

Yes, ma'am.

I think it's outside.

Oh, it would be
much safer indoors.

Dangerous things
happen out there.

Well, you oughta know.

Yes.

They do.

[ominous music]

ELVIRA: [HUMS "WHEN JOHNNY COMES
MARCHING HOME"]

I'll put your bag by your bed.

Thank you, ma'am.

Please make yourself
comfortable, Mr. York.

You are our guest.

EDWIN: You are most kind.

[ominous music]

Hello, son.

[dramatic music]


Edwin, this is my father.

EDWIN: Pleased to meet you.

[ominous music]

ELVIRA: You are a farmer,
Mr. York, is that right?

Yes, ma'am.

I have some land
outside Fort Scott.

ELVIRA: How large is your plot?

EDWIN: Near about 200 acre.

ELVIRA: 200?

What do you grow?

EDWIN: Wheat mostly.

Corn.

ELVIRA: Corn?

Kate loves Corn.

Don't you, Kate?

KATE: Yes.

I do love corn.

[suspenseful music]

EDWIN: What are you
doing, little boy?

What are you doing?

[suspenseful music]

Who taught you that?

He makes up all
sorts of silly games.

Stop it, boy.

We have pork tonight.

No!

Who taught you that, boy?

ELVIRA: No, dear.

Only... only potatoes.

I said pork!

ELVIRA: Yes, dear.

Edwin...

EDWIN: Who taught you that?

KATE: Edwin!

EDWIN: Who taught you that, boy?

KATE: [gasps]

[suspenseful music]


Mr. York!

Come back!

[thunder crashing]

ELVIRA: And they were
getting along so well.

Go outside.

Go feed the horses.

He has served his purpose.

[ominous music]




[frantic music]

[flies buzzing]

[ominous music]

Oh!

Search everything.

Everything.

Hey, hog pen and that shack.

Josh, look for tracks.

MAN: What you need?

That's about all I can say.

They did keep to themselves.

The only thing I can say is,
sure knew how to till a field.

Never known anybody in
this county that could turn

seedlings into apples so fast.

Did you find my brother?

Not yet.

Where you think they are?

With the train depot less
than 10 miles down the trail,

they could be anywhere.

We'll wire every station
between here and Chicago.

Everyone will be looking
for these people.

[ominous music]


MAN: God sure can have
a strange way sometimes.

Men, we need shovels.

JOHN JUNIOR: [hums]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]:
The newspapers

were full of accounts
of the Bloody Benders

and the bodies they left
buried in their apple orchard.

All had their throats slit
and their heads bashed in.

Except for a little girl.

She appeared to have
been buried alive.

the West Port and let

us go free, for it's up with
the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

For it's up with the
bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.

[thunder rumbling]

[downbeat music]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: We only
ever found bits of my brother.

No trace of the
Benders was ever found.

Folks claim to have seen
them up in Wichita, Chicago,

or on the streets of Omaha.

Still others swore they plain
disappeared into the prairie,

or maybe folded into the
wrinkles of the land.

[frantic music]

ELVIRA: [laughs]

EDWIN [VOICEOVER]: Here,
no one gets out alive.

We are hoping for heaven.

But most of us
are bent for Hell.

[frantic music]

WOMAN: It's to die for.

[MUSIC - RUDY LOVE, "TO DIE
FOR"]

those eyes that

walk that talk, the things.

Can you see the danger
underneath the skies?

Doctor, doctor, help us, please.

Help us please.

Feel the trouble in
the air and the breeze.

Beauty as a
seductress, seductress,

beauty as a temptress,
it's a terrible thing

to die for, to die for.

To cry for.

To lie.

Little children, don't
go into the woods.

Don't go into the woods.

The bloody [inaudible]
will do you no good.

Do you no good.

Awaiting your
reaction in the blink

of a fraction, a fraction.

Death cancels all the action.

Cancels all the action.

You realize beauty
as an attraction,

as an attraction,
beauty as a distraction,

it's a terrible thing to die
for, to die for, to lie for,

to cry for.

Underneath the clouds, blood
dripping from the trees,

dripping from the trees, you
think it's just colorful.

It's not the changing of the
leaves, changing of the leaves.

See where you been and if you
escape, and if you escape.

Know that God, your friend,
remember one thing, remember

one thing, oh, beauty is
so delicious, delicious,

beauty is so malicious,
it's a terrible thing

to die for, to die for,
to lie for, to cry for.

Think of olden days,
the posse and the clan,

the posse and the clan, nothing
good for woman or man, or man.

Out there in Kansas, in the
twister state, twister state,

you better be careful.

That's why you wait.

That's why you wait.

Beauty can't get
much colder, colder.

Beauty's in the eye
of the beholder.

To die for, to lie for,
to cry for to try for.

Ugly.

Ugly.

See beauty, beauty, oh, beauty.
