'cause you'll regret ¶

Whoo!

[blows landing]


Let's sit out.
Yeah.

How are you, cutie?

I'd be doing better without
that cigarette in my face.

Ready for the fight,
champ?

This fight's already over.

I love that attitude.

Sexy. Keep it up.

Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to our main event,

the R.F.C. Heavyweight

Championship of the World!

[crowd cheering]

The challenger tonight,
with a record of nine wins
and three losses,

he's an expert in jujitsu
and wrestling,

fighting out of
Mexico City, Mexico,

Pedro Hernandez!

[cheering continues]

Coming into the ring next

is the R.F.C. Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

standing 6'4",

weighing 250 pounds,

with an outstanding record
of 19 wins

and zero losses,

he's a freestyle fighter
out of Ross, Texas,

Colin "The Brick" Wahle!

And this is what we've
all been waiting for,

the main event--
Colin "The Brick" Wahle

against Pedro Hernandez.

[Commentator #2]
Wahle has certainly
had a meteoric rise

to the top
of the R.F.C.

And that's due
in no small part

to his outspoken manager
and owner

or Revolution Fight Club,
Victoria Ruolan.

This company's gone
through quite a makeover

since she took over
from her father.

Fighters, join me
in the center of the ring.

I want a clean fight.

Keep punches above the belt.

If I see any gouging
or hooking,

points will be deducted.

Do you understand?

Get in your corners.

[crowd cheering]

Ten million dollars
a year he's making.

Ten million a year.
And I'm his manager.

I'm not really his manager,
but we're like brothers.

Fighters ready?

Let's do it.
[bell dings]

And we're off to the races.

[Commentator #2]
Pedro's keeping his distance.

He's a big guy,
but Wahle does have

a little bit
of a reach advantage.

¶ No control,
but I'm excited ¶

¶ Kills the time,
and I can't waste it ¶

¶ Blood is mine,
and I can taste it ¶


¶ The more it hurts,
the more I feed it ¶

¶ Screw the hope,
but I won't make it ¶

¶ Hear you scream,
but I can't break it ¶

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

Back it up, Wahle.
Back it up.

Do it.
¶ Down so deep
you can't conceive ¶

¶ Filled with blood,
the shame is dirt ¶

¶ A hundred thousand
bricks won't work ¶

¶ God is left,
and he won't see ¶

¶ All that hurts
inside of me ¶

¶ Ocean slips
between the cracks ¶

¶ Leave my head
out on the tracks ¶

Yeah!

Tell me if I'm seeing things,

but it looked like The Brick
just tossed

a 225-pound man
around like a rag doll.

[Commentator #2]
He's the most devastating
fighter in the cage

since Dalton Hunt
and his 21-and-0 record
from five years ago.


Fighters do something.
Let's see something.

All right.
Break it up.

Pedro's gonna have to do better
than that if he wants the belt.

[Commentator #2]
The belt? Don't you
think he just wants

to get out of this
in one piece?

¶ [continues]

[crowd cheering]

Yeah!
That's right, bitch.

Doctors!

[bell dings]

[cheering continues]

Whoo!

I fucking love this shit!

Dalton, where you been?

Man, just blowing
my paycheck on groceries.

Well, get inside.
You gotta check this out.

You're gonna love
this, brother.

What you got?

Hey, champ. Champ.
Can I get a moment, please?

Amazing fight.

Fight?
That wasn't a fight, man.
That was a massacre.

Punk ass.

You're just one win away

from beating Dalton Hunt's
all-time R.F.C. record.

How does that feel?

Mine.
That record's gonna be mine.

He's an old man.
It's in the bag.

[TV off]

What do you think
about that?

I think I need to put
the milk away before it spoils.

That's it?
That's it.

Oh, God.

Come on, Dalton.

This could be your chance
to get back in the mix.

He's just jawing off.

People say all sorts of things
in the heat of the moment.

Well, close his jaw
for him.

I'm not fighting
anyone, Wyatt.

Why not, man?
Are you scared of him?

Huh?

Look, don't you have
any clients to punish
down at the gym?

I know you don't like
what Victoria is doing
with the league.

I get that, okay?
But you and her old man
were tight.

Just give her a call.
Not gonna happen.

You're telling me
you'd rather work at one
of her construction sites

than climb back in the ring?

Look, there's nothing wrong
with doing honest work
for an honest paycheck.

I completely agree with you.
Dang it.
[phone ringing]

This is Wyatt.

You know what?
I'll be there in five minutes.

Have her
start on the treadmill.

I gotta roll to the gym.

But at least think about
giving Victoria a call,
all right?

Oh, and Elena called, twice.

You're the most annoying
roommate ever.

Just promise me
you'll at least
think about it, man.

I promise I'll at least
think about it.

And I'm done
thinking about it.

[line ringing]

What can I do for you,
Miss Ruolan?

I have an idea
about the press
we've been looking for.

Have the legal department
do some digging

into Dalton Hunt's
old contracts.

Yes, ma'am.

Make it quick.

I need it first thing
in the morning.


Are you avoiding me?

What? No.
I mean, I, uh...

I thought you
might be asleep.

You should come in
and help me get
the little monster to sleep.

Yeah.

Grace, look who's here.
Who?

Stop the movie
and come here.

How are you, angel?

Dad!

Whoa!

Hey, isn't it
past your bedtime?

Come on.
Let's get you to sleep.

You don't have to carry me.
I'm almost 9, you know.

Oh, you're right.

Oh...

Up the steps.

Don't you need
to brush your teeth

and stuff like that,
hmm?

Already done.
Mmm.

Do you want a story?

Nah.

Is there anything else
I can do?

Well, you can be around here
a little bit more.

I know.
I've been working a lot.

Mom works a lot,
but she's still around.

I know, sweetheart.

I'll try, okay?

I'm tired.

Okay.

I'll get the lights.

Leave them on, okay?

Mom will
turn them off later.

All right.

Good night.

Not all the way.

¶ [heavy metal]

¶ Why? ¶

All right.
This one up here, champ.

Do it. One up here.
Here you go.


Bring it up.
Bring it up.

There you go, champ.
Come on.

Keep it coming.
Piece of cake.

Shit. It's all you, baby.

There you go.
Come on.

Only you, homey.

¶ Run away ¶


¶ Come again ¶

¶ [continues]

The motherfucking
Brick Wahle.

What are you doing, bro?

You've been working out
all fucking day.

Let's get the fuck
outta here.

¶ Be strong,
strong like a hurricane ¶

Hey, Wahle.
Saw your last match.
Not bad.

Not bad?

Son, you know
who this is?
He's the best.

I was just wondering
how you'd do against
a real fighter, champ.

Say it like
you mean it, huh?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Walk away, bro. Walk away.

I don't walk away
from anybody.

You want to do this, huh?
You gonna do something?

Let's go, chump.

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah ¶

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah ¶


¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

Oh, shit!

You got lucky, son.

Is that all
you got, bitch?

I got some more
for you, boy.
Come on.

¶ We do it for the money ¶

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

Kickoff time, motherfucker.

¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

And the crowd goes wild.

Yeah.

Whoa. Come on, bro.

Come on.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

[Colin laughs]

Now you know what
a real fighter hits like, huh?


Let's get outta here.

Think that's worth
three points, right, Cliff?

Get me Hunt.

Yes, ma'am.

Yo, Hunt!
Boss is here to see you, man.

Mr. Dalton Hunt,
as I live and breathe.

How have you been?

I can't complain.

That's what I like
to hear.

I had my people
do a little digging,

and it turns out
you still have one fight
in the contract

that you signed
with my father,

and I am here to collect.

Your father
said we were even.

He said that contract
was no good.

I am running the R.F.C. now.

So you can either
take the fight,

or we can settle this
in court.


My family
has been good to you.

We got you this job,

and we got your ex-wife--

is that ex-wife--
and kid into their place.

But things can change,
you know?

The fight is in two months.

See you there.

No deal.

Look what
you're doing, Dalton.

It can get really
stormy out there

for the people
you care about.

[police radio chatter]

[vehicle approaching]

[door opens]

I got your message.

What the hell
is going on here?

The sheriff came to the door
and started banging.

He gave us 30 minutes
to grab what we could,

and now we're out
in the street.

Daddy, what's happening?

It's gonna be
all right, angel.

It's okay.
I'll be right back.

Come here, baby.

How can you
do this?

Well, it seems
that they were living here

at the power of discretion
of the house's owner,

a Miss Victoria Ruolan.

God damn it!

Are we gonna
have a problem?

Nah. No problem.

Listen, I'll give you
a few more minutes,

but get it cleared out.

What did he say, Dalton?

Did he say something
about Ruolan?

What did you do?

Stop fighting.

Take care of this,
Dalton.

Look, I'll straighten
this out tomorrow.

In the meantime,
you can come stay with me.

We can't.

I promise I'll do
what it takes to fix this.

I know it's not great,
but it's all yours.

What are you going
to do, Dalton?

You don't have any money,
and we can't stay here.

It just won't work.


I know
what I have to do.

Please handle this,
Dalton.

Grace deserves better.

I know.

I'm sorry.

Any kind of chain is fine.

Just make sure to get
one of those big lots.

Never mind.
Just head on back.

[door closes]

How are you, Dalton?

I'm glad you came by.

You didn't have to bring
my family into this.

Come on.

Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

I'd like to offer you
a drink,

but since you're
in training now...

What makes you
think that?

You're here, after all.

Some people say I'm just
playing with my daddy's money--

that I don't deserve
to run the R.F.C.

Look, what's your point?

My point is
my dad could not have

his biggest draw
back into the ring

because he did not
have the balls

to do what needed
to be done.

Ironic, huh?

Yeah. He had
integrity instead.

I want this to be entertaining,
you know?

I want you
to put on a show.

Make Wahle look good.

When this is over,

you stay away from me,
my family,

and my friends.

After the fight,

I don't care
what happens to you.

I just need your ass
in the cage

in eight weeks.

If I'm gonna be training,

I can't work,

so I'll need an advance.

Of course.

I'm not stingy.

How's, uh, 20,000?

Doesn't matter to me.

I won't miss it.

Anything you need
to get ready for?

I don't need anything else
from you.

Sure thing.

It's good to be queen.

Dalton, hey, man.

I've been trying
to let this go,
but it's driving me nuts.

Listen, you got a chance
to get back in the ring--

I'm fighting Wahle.

Seriously?
That's fantastic, man.

Look, I got no business
getting back in the ring.

Yes, you do.

You do, and I got just
the trainer for you, okay?

He's the guy that got me back
into living again.

I'm telling you,
he's exactly what you need.

Well, I need all the help
I can get.

But right now,
I gotta take care of something.

All right.

All right! Yes!

We are back, baby!
We are back in the game!

Can you hear me? Whoo!

[car doors close]

I got your call.
What's going on?

Hi, Daddy.

Hey, sweetie.

I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty

of setting you guys up
in a new place.

[key jingling]

Let's go inside.

Are you serious?

Yeah. Yeah.

[Elena chuckles]

God damn. What the hell's
wrong with you,

you fucking piece of shit?

Use the pathway.

Uh, Wyatt Hart said

you could help me
get ready for my fight.

You're Dalton, right?

Yeah.

Wyatt called me about you.

Sounds like you're in
a shitload of trouble.

Enlighten me.

Well, in eight weeks,
I'm stepping into the cage
against Colin Wahle.

That guy's a monster.

Who'd you piss off?

I have a fight left on my
contract with the R.F.C.,

and they're pulling me
back in.

Can you get me ready?

Physically, yeah.

But since you ain't
fought in a while,

I'm more concerned
about getting you

right up here.

Look, as long as
I survive the fight,

I don't need to do
any soul searching.

Yeah, well, we'll see.

So you ain't fought in,
like, what, five years?

Mmm.

That's a lifetime
in this game.

Look,
if it's a money thing--
Don't need it.

No. I'm doing this
as a favor to Wyatt.

If you stick with it,
I'll train you.

But you need to know that
I do things a little different.

I'm in.

All right, then.

I want you to meet me
at a bar called Bull McCabe's,
9:00 tonight.

You know it?

What, we gonna be
pounding some back?

In a manner of speaking.

All right.
I'll see you then.


Use the path,
God damn it.

Attagirl.
That's looking good.

¶ [rock]


All right, guys.

¶ [continues]

Well, this is fun.

Ain't supposed
to be fun.

This is training.

You know, in Japan,
a fighter in the Valor
Federation

ain't even allowed
anywhere near a bar
before a fight.

I never
agreed with that.

I think it's good
to cut loose

every now and again.

Wait here.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

Y'all play professional
football, don't you?

Damn straight.
Oh, I thought so.

Yeah. 'Cause my friend
over there--

he said he saw the game
on TV last week

and, boy, y'all sucked.

What fucking friend?

That fella right there
at the bar.

That fucking guy
right there?
Yep.

Matter of fact,
he said y'all sucked so bad

that he's pretty sure
he could whip each

and every one of your asses,
starting with you.

That fucking guy
right there?
Yeah.

I told him we should just have
some drinks and settle down,
but, mmm...

I'll tell y'all what.

Y'all boys
stay right here.

I'm gonna be right back.

Let me see what's up.

Hey, man, what's your
fucking problem, man?

No problem here.

Your buddy down there
says you're talking shit
about my team.

No. He's just
playing around.

See how old he is?
He's completely senile.

Yeah, well, I don't like
fucking jokes, man.

Hey, neither do I.
I hate jokes.

I'm just sorry
about the confusion.

Let me buy you guys
a round of drinks.

You know what?
That's what's up.

Oh, for God sakes.

Boy, do you fucking
really want to do this?

See, why would anyone
sane do that?

Don't worry about me, Dalton.

Is he behind me?

Yeah.

Old man or not,
I'm gonna punch your ass out.

Yeah.

What's up, man?
Thought you didn't
want to fight.

I don't.
It's on, then.

¶ [rock]

Whip your ass now,
pretty man.

¶ [continues]

Come on. Come on.

Come on, man.
We're both gonna get hurt.

You don't want to lose out
on the season, right?

Not the both of us.
Just you, motherfucker.

¶ Dominate, dominate, yeah ¶

¶ [continues]


Come on.
Get your ass up.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, motherfucker.
Come on.
Asshole.

¶ Take it outside
if it's what you choose ¶

¶ No turnin' back,
don't be confused ¶

¶ Fights to the death
don't win, Jack ¶

¶ Dance to the beat
like your head's on crack ¶

¶ Dominate, dominate, yeah ¶


Hey, you!

That's enough
of fucking that!

How about we call it
a night, champ?

Man, fuck that shit, man.
Whatever.

I'll see you again.

Come on, boys.
Let's roll.

Damn it, Willy.

Hey, nice work.

What were you thinking?
We could've gotten hurt.

Oh, no. You're a much
better fighter than that.

Eh, besides,

we learned a valuable
lesson tonight.

And what's that?

You're more willing
to fight for somebody else
than fight for yourself.

You pissed off
a 300-pound guy
to make a point?

I like real-world examples.

Now, it's been what,
five years since
you hit somebody?

You could've
knocked that guy out.
Why didn't you?

Man, I just want to go home.

All right.
Suit yourself.

Just be back at my place
in the morning.

Oh, yeah.
You sure you don't
want to pick a fight

at a mall or something?

That's a good one.
I like you, kid.

Yeah, we will get you ready
for a thousand swords.

Get you some rest.
You're gonna need it.

Shoot it.
Get off my back, man!


Wyatt.


Hey.

Hey...

That shit knocked me out.

Hell, yeah, it did.

[chattering continues]

All right, buddy.
You know?

This knee's coming up, boy.

Let's see a smile
from my boys.

Hey! Smile.
You want a smile?
Hey.

I'll smile

'cause I'm Wyatt "All Hart"
right here.

All Hart.
All Hart, baby.

All Hart
and baby fat.
And hard--

Why you gotta do that, man?
Why you gotta say that, man?

...pounds over, Wyatt.

That's why.
You are all talk.

Let's see it.
Come on.

Ooh!

Is it gonna be like that?

It's always like that,
Wyatt.

You gonna take that, Dalton?

You ain't so bad, champ.
You know what?

I ain't so bad?
Hey, fuck it.

I ain't so bad?
Look at you.

You're gonna need it.

You want to talk,
you gotta play.

I'll fucking play.
Let's play.

I'm not fucking around, Dalton.
This is the real fucking shit.

I will bring it right now.
You don't have
what it takes, Wyatt.

I'm not gonna watch
two best friends
beat each other up.

You might turn your camera off
for this shit, then.
Put your guard in.

I'm not fucking around.
Put your money
where your mouth is.

I'm serious.
Let's fucking go.

Come on.
Let's go.

Hold on, hold on.

I never said
it's a game, Wyatt.



Wyatt?
Somebody call an ambulance.

An ambulance!

Oh, God!
What did I do?

Ohh...

[TV off]

All right.
I want you to start running,

and don't stop
until I tell you.

How the hell you gonna
catch up, old man?

Just do
like I say, now.

Go!

¶ Desperately ¶

¶ Trying to find my way ¶

¶ And hopelessly ¶

¶ Grabbing for
the words to say ¶

¶ And I can't see ¶

¶ I'm searching
for the remedy ¶

¶ And I want to be ¶

Come on, son!
Move!

I got a three-legged dog
run faster than you.

Oh, come on, Dalton.
Keep up with me.

Show me something.

Come on.

¶ When you're
so far from me ¶

¶ I'm desperately seeking ¶

¶ I'm dangerously hoping ¶

¶ The walls will come down ¶

¶ To go home right now ¶

¶ And I'm desperately seeking ¶

¶ I'm dangerously hoping ¶

¶ The walls will come down ¶

¶ 'Cause I ¶

What took you so long?

Here you go, Peanut.

Catch you back at the barn.
Come on.
Wait.

Attaboy.

How you feeling?

Oh. Not good, huh?


Take shorter breaths.

Tell you,
your cardio's terrible

and the coordination's off,

but the important thing
is you didn't quit.

Good sign.

You want some water?

There's a spigot
around the side of the house.

Help yourself.

Do me a favor.

Sure.

Remind me to kill Wyatt.


I ain't gonna have you
holding some jars

like in those
old kung fu movies

to strengthen your arms.

That's just ridiculous.

I find that these cinder blocks
are a lot more effective.

Tighten your core.

[crying out]

Pick them up.

Whenever you're ready.

I've had enough.

You know,
people in California

would love to have
that water you just wasted.

Rationing that shit.

[engine grinding]

Aw...


Aw, damn it.

Not again.

Piece of shit.


Look, I know this ain't
gonna be easy for you.

Wyatt told me

that you hadn't stepped foot
in a gym since the accident.

Look, I just--

You just need
to keep taking

one step after another,
and listen to me,

hard as that might be.

[engine grinds]
Damn it!

Looks like you're
gonna have to hoof it.

That's all right.
Leave it here.
I'll take a look at it.

Hoof it?

Yeah. Yeah.

It's only seven miles
to the gym.

Be good for you.

Seven miles?

Seven and a half.

[no audible dialogue]

I'm not fucking around, Dalton.
This is the real fucking shit.

You don't have
what it takes, Wyatt.

I ain't so bad?

Let's fucking go.
Come on. Here it comes.

Oh, it's like that?
I never said
it's a game, Wyatt.

Somebody call an ambulance.
An ambulance!

Ah, that's it.
Push, push.

Again. That's the way.

Push. That's it.

Turn them, just like
you're turning over that punch.

Again. Don't stop.
No resting.

Come on now.
Watch that center of gravity.

There you go, baby.
There you go.

Get a little meat on.
All right.

You're gonna be fighting
that big fucking Mohawk
son of a bitch.

Don't quit. I guarantee
you he doesn't quit.
Let's go, baby.

Come on, Dalton.

¶ Have I had enough? ¶

Take five minutes.
Forget it. You know what?

Take seven hours off.
I'm done.


I'm gonna get in there
myself and do it

if you don't start
smacking that bag.

¶ Am I only gaining ¶

Man, come on.
Don't snap, snap, snap.

You need to get
your heart right, man.

I can't even watch
this anymore.

¶ Tell you when you say ¶

Come on, Datlon!
Push it!

¶ Forever is never ¶

Push it, push it, push it!

¶ The word I'll use again ¶

¶ Life is fleeting ¶

Come on, come on!

Aw, my grandma
can run faster than that.

¶ [continues]

No more.
Enough for today.

Enough?
Aw, fuck you, Dalton!

Hey...

Come on, man.

You haven't stepped it up
all week.

You got a second chance here,
and that's the best
you're gonna do?

Wyatt--
Fuck it.

Seriously, man.

If I could walk
for just one day,

I would never stop running,
not for a second.

So don't give me this bullshit
about enough

when you got a second chance
to do what I would kill for.

Fuck! This is bullshit!

I go faster in my chair!
You got no fucking heart
right now!

He's got a point.

Yeah, he does.

¶ [rock]

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

¶ Bombs, yeah, bombs ¶

¶ Yeah ¶
[bell dings]

¶ We droppin' bombs, yeah ¶

I'd like to thank all of you
for coming here

to make what I think
is going to be
some very interesting news.

Thanks for having us,
Grant and Todd.

There's no better show
to make this announcement.

The fight
we've all been waiting for

is finally going to happen.

Six weeks from tonight,

Colin Wahle
will face Dalton Hunt.

This will be the culmination
of years of work

in bridging these
two generations of fighters.

Dalton, first off,
I'd like to say

how good it is
to have you back on the scene.

But what the hell
have you been thinking?

Well, Todd,
I've been asking myself that

for the past two weeks.

are you at all worried

about facing Dalton Hunt
in the ring?

I think it's high time
for the torch to be passed.

If he won't give it up,
I'll take it from him.

Any response, Dalton?

Well, Grant, I can't compete
with sound bites like that.

Any predictions, champ?

Hmm. First-round knockout.

I'm gonna show up,
knock his ass out,
get my paycheck.

I'm gonna go home.

Dalton's too much
of a gentleman to say it,
so I'll say it for him.

You're a punk, Wahle.

Is that right?
Whoa. Hold on now, guys.
Let's keep this professional.

You haven't fought anybody.
Ruolan's too scared to put
you up against a real fighter.

Afraid you might lose.
You stand up against
a fighter like Dalton,

you're going down.

Thanks for your concern.
Don't worry.

I'm not gonna end up
in a wheelchair.

You know what?
I'm more of a man in this chair

than anybody you fought
in your whole career.

What about that?
Where you going, hot wheels?

Hey, man, you never touch
another man's wheels.

Aah!


Take it easy.

Fucking guy
broke my fucking arm!

You're mine, old man!
You're mine!

Hey, hey...

Can we just cut
to commercial? Cut!

Now, time to meet
your new team,

your new best friends

and worst enemies.

First, Dexter,

former Golden Gloves fighter
and welterweight champion.

He's gonna be working
on getting your speed
and your punching power up.

Kwan here has trained
with the Greasers.

His job's to turn you
into a grappling machine.

Finally, Bronner.

Born in the Bahamas,
raised in Thailand.

He's been a fighter
since he was 8.

Your legs and knees are his
to turn into weapons.

All right.
Let's get started.

Dexter, you're up.

¶ [rock]

¶ Bless my soul,
but I can't fight it ¶

¶ No control,
but I'm excited ¶

¶ Kills the time,
and I can't waste it ¶

¶ Blood is mine,
and I can taste it ¶

¶ Cut my mind,
but I don't need it ¶

¶ The more it hurts,
the more I feed it ¶

¶ Screw the hope,
but I won't make it ¶

¶ Hear you scream,
but I can't break it ¶

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

¶ Filled with smoke,
but I don't breathe ¶

¶ Down so deep
you can't conceive ¶

¶ Filled with blood,
the shame is dirt ¶
Kwan.

¶ A hundred thousand
bricks won't work ¶

¶ God has left,
and he won't see ¶

¶ All that hurts
inside of me ¶

¶ Ocean slips
between the cracks ¶

¶ Leave my head
out on the tracks ¶

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

[muffled yell]

Damn it, Dalton.

Get your head
into training.

Now, Wahle's out there
probably working ten times

harder than you.

All right.
Let's run it again.

This time,
don't go easy on him.

¶ Addict, addict ¶

¶ Addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

¶ Addict, addict ¶
Come on.

¶ Addict ¶
Come on.

[yells, groans]
¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

Bring me another one,
Luther.
¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

Just seeing
how my fighter's doing.

[lighter clicking]


This place is a dive.

Why don't you come work out
at the company's gym?

Everything is
state of the art.

I like this place just fine.

Suit yourself.

I knew you were
in great shape,

just not

this good.

[barbell clangs on ground]

Look,

I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

Sorry. I just wanted
to apologize

if I was too harsh,
Dalton.

There's no reason
that we can't get along.

Oh, I can think
of a couple of reasons.

The pay-per-view numbers
are coming in for the fight,

and they're damn good.

We could make
a really great pair.

You bought a fight,

not this fighter.

So how about you lock up
when you're done?

You asshole.

You're gonna be so sorry

for the opportunity
you just missed.

The Wahle is going to
crush you. You hear me?

You don't stand a chance.


[grunting continues]

And time.

Take a breather.


Aw, you son of a bitch.

Why don't you just take it
down to the tackle shop?

You can't always let
someone else fix your problems.

You should know that.

What, more philosophy?

It's all philosophy.

Anything anyone
ever says or does

is tied to their philosophy
of the world.

Can't I just
do more running?

This is important, Dalton.

No more. Not today.

So what, you're just gonna quit
every time I bring this up?

I'm not quitting.
Well, you might as well.

Ain't really doing anything.

The best running you do
is running scared.

Oh. Did I hit a sore spot?

Huh?

I bet you're just dying
to hit me, aren't you?

Okay.

Right now. Come on.
Give me your best shot.

Come on. Seriously?

Seriously.

Are you too scared
to do that?

You fucking pussy.

You ain't no fighter.


Damn it.

You ain't mad
at me, Dalton.

You're mad
at yourself.

Until you realize that,
you ain't going nowhere.

[breathing heavily]

You think I like
what I've become?

What I haven't become?

I ask myself every day,

if only I'd kicked higher

or lower, if only
he'd turned the other way--

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it didn't happen
that way, did it?

It ain't about
what if.

It's about what is!

And until you face
what happen

and believe that it couldn't
have happened any other way,

you're stuck, Dalton.

You're literally
living in your guilt,

and you've become
so used to it

that you are just
too scared to move on.

It's not that goddamn easy.

Oh, hell.
What is easy?

Look at Wyatt.
You think anything's
easy for him?

He ain't never
gonna walk again.

He's in a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

Ain't nothing
easy for him.

The least you can do
is step up

and be the warrior
that he can't be.

What are you doing?

Not quitting.

[grunting continues]

¶ [rock]


47, 48, 49, 50!

More!

Jab.

Here we go. Combo.


51, 52...


53, 54--
Come on!

Oh, shit.
Aah!

55, 56...

Take a breather.

More!

Here we go.
Nobody's better.
Nobody's faster.

Nobody's stronger.
Only you.
You're the best.

Nice!

See if you can hit
through that fucking bag.

What you got?
Break it down.
There it is.

Fucking hit it back,
baby.

There you go! Whoo!

There it is.


What the fuck's
your problem, man?

I'm trying
to fucking help you.

I can't work
with this motherfucker.


Get me another one, Luther.

Maybe a little bit
bigger this time, huh?

Flew me all the way out here
for this bullshit?

Can't deal
with this fucking guy.

Look.
He fucking head-butted me.

You don't walk out on me.
I'm your boss. I hired you.

Do what I say.
Fuck this.

I'm outta here.

Hi, cutie.

Got some time
for the boss?

My bonus coming early
this year?

Yes.



So it's time
for phase 2.
Fuck.

You ever heard of the legend
of a thousand swords?

Nah.

Well,

Neyatu Tatagami

was a great Ronin Samurai
Warrior in the 1600s.

He was a bandit,
outlaw and a folk hero

to the people of Japan.

Well, one day, he robbed
a young, arrogant nobleman

who decided to seek revenge
on Tatagami.

Well, the nobleman put
a large cash reward

on Tatagami's head.

And the money was so great

that a thousand warriors
showed up for a chance
to collect.

Well, the nobleman,
not being one

to miss an opportunity
to get Tatagami,

hired them all.

Well, everybody figured that
Tatagami would cut and run,

but instead, he sent a message

saying that he would stay and
fight the thousand warriors.

Now, in the morning
of the battle,

Tatagami meditated
and remained calm.

A small boy
in a nearby village

stopped Tatagami
on the way to the fight,
and he asked him,

"How can you beat
a thousand warriors?"

Tatagami looked at the boy,
smiled, and he said,

"Simple.

I will just use
1,000 swords."

And with that,

Tatagami marched off
to meet his destiny.

I don't get it.

You can defeat any enemy

as long as you take him apart
piece by piece,

one thread at a time.

Now, Wahle's got
a well-rounded game,

and we need
to redevelop yours,

get every piece
as sharp as it can be.

Okay, Dalton. This is it.

We're gonna
run a shark drill.

That's three against one.

Okay?
All right.

All right, Dexter.
Let's go.


Let's go, Dalton.
Let's go.

Ooh.

Bronner.

Kwan.

Come on, Dalton!
Suck it up!

Come on, Dalton.
You're better than this.

Maybe I'm not ready.

Oh, you're ready.

You just gotta
start fighting smarter.

You've got
all the pieces.

Look-- Look at me.

You gotta bring out
your swords.

You get what I mean?

¶ [rock]

Round 2.

Come on. You got this, Dalton.
Let's go, baby. Come on.

¶ It is hard ¶

There you go.
Kwan.

¶ And the games are over ¶

¶ And it gets harder ¶


¶ And it's hard ¶

¶ When you wake up
so much older ¶
Bronner!

¶ And it's harder still ¶

Yeah!

¶ Let it go ¶

¶ Let it go ¶

¶ Let it go ¶

Whoo! Yeah, baby! Yeah!

¶ Let it go ¶

I told you,
when you got it, bro,
you got it.

¶ Let it go ¶

Remember when I used
to come home from fights,

and you'd be there
to make it all better?

That seems like
a long time ago.

Yeah.

Better?

Yeah.

I came here
to ask you a favor.

I want you
to come to the fight.

Dalton, I--

I mean, strictly
as moral support.

It would...

I'd feel better
if you were there.

I'd feel better.

Ouch.

I'm still mad at you.

I know.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's going to take
a lot more than a new place

and coming around here
like a little puppy dog.

You dropped out of our lives
for almost a year.

Now, I understand
that you were hurt

and depressed,

but we have a little girl
to take care of,

and I need to count on you
to be her dad

through thick and thin.

I know.

I know. I'm sorry.

I'll always be there
for both of you.

I'm sorry, too.

You know I love you.

That will never change.

Can I see her?

Yeah. Of course.

¶ [soft rock]

¶ It's getting
hard to breathe ¶

¶ Your heart is broken ¶
Shh.

¶ It's hard to see ¶

¶ What's closed will open ¶

¶ Stay tuned out ¶

¶ With me ¶

¶ Together we'll find a way ¶

¶ To see again ¶

¶ I'll leave the light on ¶

¶ So you can always see ¶

¶ I'll leave the light on ¶

¶ So you can find me ¶

¶ [Man rapping]

Here's to the ass beating
of the century

that is about to take place.

Right here, big man.
Right here.

Prosit, my friend.
Cheers.

¶ [continues]

[exhales forcefully]

Here you go.

You know, he is
the best natural fighter
that I have ever seen.

It's just his head.
You gotta get his head right.
You can do it.

I'm working on it.

Wait, wait.
You're not going home yet,
are you, old man?

A trainer's work's
never done.

Oh, man.

Hey, Martin.
Yeah, man.

You make sure Wyatt
gets home all right?

Not a problem.
Come on, man.

Aah...

¶ You are now rockin'
with the best ¶

¶ Take a deep breath
and lift your arms
above your chest ¶

Ohhh...

¶ We still rock the spot
like we never even met ¶

¶ You wonder what we got ¶

I fucking love this shit.

¶ [rock]

Marty, you're the greatest
bartender on the planet.

I love you,
but I can wheel my ass home.

No. Give me a second to get
these stragglers outta here.

I'll meet you
in the parking lot, all right?

¶ [Man rapping]

¶ They do what
they say they not ¶

Hey, Ed.
Hey, stop the car.

What the hell, man?
Stop, stop, stop.

There's the fucking guy
from the studio.

That fucker
in the wheelchair.

That's the fucking guy
that did this to me.

Yeah, I'm gonna beat
his fucking ass.

¶ A bat in the face,
drop a crack in the case ¶

This is gonna be fun.

¶ [continues]

¶ And then she blows,
she says-- ¶

Hey.
Hey!

Yeah. Hey, I know you.

Yeah, you do.

Yeah-- Oh, shit.
I do that?

Yeah, you did, actually.

Hey, man, you know,

no hard feelings, right?

Don't worry about it.

I'm just gonna finish
what I started in the studio.

What the...

[blows landing]


[car alarm blaring]

[chirps, alarm stops]

Oh, damn it.

[line ringing]

[siren wailing]


Dalton--
Thank God he's all right.

Hey, Dalton.

I'm here, Wyatt.

He broke my chair, man.

Who did this?

You just worry
about your fight.

Wyatt, who did this to you?

You need to tell me
who did this.

It was Wahle's boy,
Cliff.

Damn it.

¶ [R & B]

¶ See, my girl in the back,

¶ Together you see
what's fresh as can be ¶

¶ There ain't a man

Well, well, well.
Mr. Dalton Hunt.

What brings you
to my neck of the woods?

You come to, uh, forfeit,
or to try out my batting cages?

I'm looking for Cliff.

Cliff.
[clicking tongue]

Cliff. I don't think
I know a Cliff.

Fuck!
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Let's not get crazy now.

Cliff jumped
Wyatt tonight.

He's in
the fucking hospital.

Wyatt, huh?
Listen.

I understand
you being pissed off,

but I can't let you
take a bat to my boy Cliff.

The bat's not for me.

I brought it for him.

Hmm.

All right.

This might be interesting.

Darling, go get Cliff now.

I gotta be honest, man.

You got a lot of balls
showing up here like this, son.

I don't give a shit
what you think, Wahle.

These your cars?
Yeah.

Must be nice
to be Ruolan's bitch, huh?
[door closes]

Brick, what the fuck, man?

What the fuck
is this guy doing here?

This guy's got some
business with you, Cliff.

[Cliff scoffs]

What the fuck's he want
with me?

I know what you did
to Wyatt, motherfucker.

Still feel like taking
a swing at someone?

Huh?

What, you fucking kidding me?

Yeah, I'm a barrel
of fucking laughs right now.

Brick--

You gonna let this guy
roll up here

and disrespect us
at my house?

I think a bat's
pretty good odds.

Let's take care
of it, son.

Yeah. Come on, son.

All right. Fuck it.

You want a fucking piece
of this, old man?

Dalton fucking Hunt,
you fucking dinosaur.

I don't need a fucking bat
for this old fucking
dinosaur motherfucker.

I don't even need the bat.
I don't fucking need the bat,
but I'm gonna use it.

This motherfucker is just
trying to get out the fight.

You're trying to play crazy
so you don't have to
hit my fucking boy.

You don't want to fight
my boy, do you, huh?
Section 8 motherfucker.

That's what you want.
You want to not have
to fuck with my boy.

Fucking pussy.
I bet you're gonna put up
a little bit more of a fight

than your crippled-ass
friend, huh?

You flinching?
You fucking pussy.

I shot the fucker--
Let's see it.

Wahle,

see you on Saturday.

Mm-hmm.

Not now.

¶ My town, baby ¶
¶ Right, uh-huh ¶

¶ Code red ¶
¶ They want it now ¶

¶ I sure am
gonna blow it down ¶
¶ Timber ¶

¶ What you gonna do now? ¶
¶ Run ¶

¶ [continues]

Yo, Hunt.

Aw, not this again.

Yo, man, I don't want
any more trouble.

Yo, man, I saw you on TV.

And what? I suck?

Well, you ain't
no public speaker,
but you got good hands.

You can fight
like a motherfucker.

But you know that
punk bitch Colin Wahle?

Do me a favor.

Fuck his ass up for me
tonight, yo.

That's what's up.

All right.

[snaps fingers]

Peace out.
Come on, boys.

Let's move.

¶ Make money, get funny,
it's the C.R.T. ¶

Yeah, I knew
he'd come around.

Still can't play football
worth shit,

but he got it.

¶ [rock]

Hey.

This is a big night.

You're a good lay,
and we make money together,

so don't fuck this up.

What a crazy bitch.


How you feeling?

Honestly,

I'm scared.

Well,

not for long.

You'll see.

[crowd cheering]

Ladies and gentlemen,
it's now time

for your main event!

[cheering continues]

Folks, this has gotta be
one for the ages.

Dalton Hunt has come out
of retirement

to face the current champ,
Colin Wahle, in a three-round

non-titled fight.
Yes, indeed.

The Brick,
as he's known to fight fans,

has blasted his way
through the R.F.C.

and is now just one win away
from the all-time record.

But I doubt he's had to face
anyone like Hunt in his career.

It's gonna be a doozy.

The challenger tonight

is a former R.F.C. champion

making his first appearance
in the ring in five years,

standing 6'2" tall,

weighing 220 pounds,

Dalton Hunt!

¶ [rock]
[cheering continues]


¶ [continues]

And coming into
the ring next

is the R.F.C. Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

with an outstanding record

of 20 wins and zero losses,

standing 6'4",
weighing 250 pounds,

Colin "The Brick" Wahle!

¶ [rock]
[cheering continues]

Yeah!

Yeah!

¶ Bless my soul,
but I can't fight it ¶

¶ No control,
but I'm excited ¶

¶ Kills the time,
and I can't waste it ¶

¶ Blood is mine,
and I can taste it ¶

¶ Cut my mind,
but I don't need it ¶

¶ The more it hurts,
the more I feed it ¶

¶ Screw the hope,
but I won't make it ¶

¶ Hear you scream,
but I can't break it ¶
[jeering continues]

¶ Addict, addict, addict ¶

¶ Now you're fucking joking ¶

All right, fighters.
Join me in the center
of the ring.

All right.
Y'all both know the drill.

If I see anything
get out of hand,
I will stop it.

Watch the shots
to the back of the head.

And keep it clean.
Got it?

Touch gloves.

You know, your boy Wyatt

put up a pretty good fight
for a guy in a wheelchair.

You were there?

It was almost as entertaining
as you and Cliff.

You son of a bitch!

Save it. Save it.
Corners, fighters.

Get in your corner.
He's trying to get
in your head.

You hear me?

Don't let him.

[Men whistling]

You should be getting
some rest, Mr. Hart.

No. Hey, no.
I would not touch that
if I were you.


You go out there
and fight your fight,
all right? You hear?

¶ [rock]

[bell dings]
[crowd cheering]

You're gonna have to
do better than that.

They're both being really
careful with each other.

I don't know if Wahle's
got much to worry about.

This could just be
a show of respect.

¶ [continues]

How you like that,
motherfucker?

I think the champ
might've felt that one.


Now we're seeing
why the champ is the champ.

Get in there!

Finish him!

Tap out, old man.
Not gonna happen, asshole.


Hang on, Dalton!

Fighter, you okay?

You okay?
Fine.

Tap out.

He's all over Hunt.
This could be it.

Come on, Dalton.
Come on.

Hang on! Take it!

Tap out, old man.

Not gonna happen.

[bell dinging]

All right. Separate.

All right. Good boy.

You look good out there.
Looking good, huh?

There you go.

Hey, stop messing around.

If you want to fight,
give it to him.

Hear me?
Give it to him!

Sit down and shut up, woman!

If you can do better,
you get in here.

Don't forget
who the boss is.

You hear me?

How you feeling?
You ain't getting tired,
are you?

Not yet.

Brick hits hard.

You're just gonna have to
hit harder, all right?

Now, look, he's throwing
big, wide punches.

Get tight.
Under him. Boom.

Upper cut. Right hooks.

Just hook in there.
Get in there and hook.
Use your speed.

Use your speed, all right?

Get out there now.
You got this.

You got this.
You got this, you hear me?

[crowd cheering]

[bell dings]


[cheering continues]

Use your speed. 1, 2, 3.


¶ [continues]

Oh, come on, Dalton.
Come on.

Hit him, Colin!
Hit him!

That looked intentional to me.

[crowd jeering]
Shut the fuck up!

Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

A thousand swords!

A thousand swords!

[bell dinging]
[crowd cheering]

Fuck you!

Go to your corner.
Doctor.

God damn! That's a fucking
intentional head-butt!

Open your eyes!

Is it bad?
It's pretty bad.

I can't stop fighting.

You trust me?
You know it.

All right.
This might hurt like hell.


Ain't nothing but
a little old scratch, Doc.

Yeah.

We're getting the okay.

This fight is going
into the third round.

Finish him! Got it?
I want you to finish him!

Finish him, asshole!

¶ I make it last ¶

¶ Got nothing, coming up ¶
Fuck!

¶ From behind ¶
All right.

It's time
to take him apart.

You can do this.

Take him apart!

Time to bring out
the swords.

All right.

¶ I got an earful
of your flattering lines ¶

¶ You're getting good
'cause you never look him
straight in the eyes ¶

¶ I'm at the area tanks,
and I'm there in the hurt ¶

¶ I got a fight to incite
'cause I find you absurd ¶

Get him, Dalton.

That's my best friend
right there.

¶ I'm burnin' it down ¶
[bell dings]

¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

¶ I'm burnin' it down ¶

¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

Yeah! Ow!

Son of a bitch.
Get him, Dalton.


¶ I'm getting to ¶

¶ I'm gonna burn it down ¶

¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

¶ Gonna burn it down ¶

¶ Ohhhhhh ¶

Holy shit!

The fight has spilled
out of the ring, folks.

Come on, Dalton. Go.

Yeah!

Yes!
A thousand swords, baby!


[crowd cheering]

The champ is down!

You d-- You did it!
We did it!

Dalton Hunt has just
knocked out the champ!

Yes! Right there, baby!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Get up! Get up, Colin!
Get up! Get up!

The winner.
[cheering continues]

[Victoria yelling]
I'm so proud of you.

Get up!

Get up!

This the kind of show
you're looking for?

Fuck you!

Fuck you!
I'm so proud of you.

Dalton, how does it feel
to be back on top?

Give it to me.

Listen up.

This does not count.

Okay? You hear me?

The cage broke.

He's disqualified.

[crowd jeering]
Shut the fuck up!

All of you losers,

I own this place.

I own this place!
I own you!

Without me,
you're nothing.

Fuck you, bitch!

That's what you get
for kicking me and my daughter
out of my house, bitch.

Let me go!

Now stay away from my man.

¶ I know that you ¶

You win.

Congratulations.

¶ It's always been you ¶

If I hadn't seen it myself,
I wouldn't have believed it.

But controversy or not,

Dalton Hunt fought
and won like a champion.

Here's what Colin Wahle
had to say for himself
this morning.

I'm just here
to let the fans know
that old man got lucky.

That's it.

Are you ready
to fight him again?
Absolutely.

Just waiting for Ruolan
to set the fight up.

Would you be willing
to put up the belt
next time?

Man, get that the hell
away from me!

It's nice to see
that this loss

hasn't changed
the Wahle's attitude.

On an interesting
side note,

Wahle's referring
to Arnold Ruolan,

who relieved his daughter
of ownership of the R.F.C.

following that fiasco
that happened at the Luminar
two nights ago.

whether this is a return
to fighting for him,

but his strong showing
has this reporter thinking

that his retirement
might just be over.

[horse whinnying]

So, Dalton, you did
real good out there.

So, I, uh--
Come, honey.

...got you
a little upgrade.

Wow. Super cool, Dad.

Took a little doing,
but she runs like new.

Those flames right there--
that was my idea.

I couldn't have
one of my fighters

driving around
in a clunker.

Gotta respect
those old classics.

Believe me, I do.

But I should be giving you
the truck or something

for everything
you've done for me.

Yeah, what do I need
a truck for?

I got my wheels
right over there.

Can I pet him?

Well,
sure you can, hon.

Careful, careful,
careful. He bites.

I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

Well, all right, then.
Let's take it for a spin.

Well, now, it ain't
going to be that easy

because the keys are out
there in the oak tree.

Is that right?
Yeah.

And to prove that you're worthy

of a fine piece of automotive
history like this,

you're going
to have to race us.

1, 2, 3, go. Go!

Get out, Wyatt.

¶ [rock]

Move it, move it,
move it, Dalt!

Come on, Dalton! Go!
My grandmother can run
faster than that!

My grandma's real fast,
though.

Well,

Dalton's never gonna
forgive me for this one.

Come on.

¶ I'm a renegade ¶

¶ Back out, motherfucker ¶

¶ You better tap out ¶

¶ Boo-hoo, you crying baby ¶

¶ Where you at now? ¶

¶ 'Cause I be lookin' for you ¶

¶ Me and my people
lookin' ready ¶

¶ And we're lookin'
for truth ¶

¶ So come and get this ¶

¶ Make it hurt,
you know I love it ¶

¶ When you test this ¶

¶ Put me up into a corner ¶

¶ Be a witness ¶

¶ Yeah, this is critical mass ¶

¶ We invite the revolution,
we ignite the past ¶

¶ See me ¶

¶ I'm still standing ¶

¶ I might be bleeding ¶

¶ But I'm still breathing ¶

¶ I'll never surrender
'cause I'm a renegade ¶

¶ What, what,
you want some ¶

¶ Come and get some,
pussy motherfucker ¶

¶ I got you where
you live, nigga ¶

¶ Me, you will
never control, no ¶

¶ Genocidal maniacal ¶

¶ Devil, the party's over,
I'm a renegade ¶

¶ A runaway slave ¶

¶ I've been dreaming
about my freedom ¶

¶ On the underground train ¶

¶ It's Armageddon
you're getting,
just what you wanted ¶

¶ Critical mass,
freedom at last,
freedom at last ¶

¶ See me ¶

¶ I'm still standing ¶

¶ I might be bleeding ¶

¶ But I'm still breathing ¶

¶ You might hate me ¶

¶ But you can't break me ¶

¶ I might be bleeding ¶

¶ But I'm still breathing ¶

¶ This dog will turn around
and bite you ¶

¶ Turn around and, what? ¶

¶ Bite you ¶

¶ This dog will turn around
and bite you ¶

¶ This dog will, what? ¶
[dog growling]

How long you think
I'm just gonna let you
fuck with me

and not do something
about it?

You think I'm just gonna
turn the other cheek?

¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶

¶ You push me,
so I'll push you right back ¶
