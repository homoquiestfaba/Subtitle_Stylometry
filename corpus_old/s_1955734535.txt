Love.

Love is so complex.

It can either be the greatest
feeling in the world or...

it can cause immense pain,

and usually it's us, people,
who cause that pain

because we're flawed,
dishonest, scared.

Emotional injury can be just as
crippling as physical injury,

disrupting our mood,

productivity and personal interactions
which all leads to more pain.

When left to deal with this trauma
on our own the cycle never ends.

But now,

through the Department
of emotional integrity

we can prevent this
cycle from ever beginning.

The DEI brings structure

to the chaotic mess that
comes with falling in love

by assigning emotional
integrity scores people are

held accountable for their actions

which promotes an
honesty and rationality.

This all leads to higher
productivity in the workplace,

greater financial credibility,

but most importantly,

successful relationships.

Since its establishment,
the DEI has helped

millions of people
in this country.

Our emotional health
and quality of life are

at its highest ever because we can all
finally have confidence in one another.

Now most of you here are
18 years old or very close

which is the legal age to register
relationships with the DEI

Once you're in our
system you'll be given a

neutral emotional
integrity score of 70.

From there it's your responsibility
to increase or decrease it.

Yes. How do you raise
your EI score?

That's a good question.
Does anyone here know?

What are you thinking?

You find a really special
girl you're crazy for,

get registered and
don't let her go.

[students chuckle]

Well that is part of it.
It is true that you can

increase your score by being in a
registered relationship that extends

beyond 12 months.

You can also increase your score

by registering with someone who
has a higher score than you.

Yes.

What does it mean when
other kids call my mom

a score digger?
It means she's a slut.

Hey now. There is nothing
wrong with being attracted

to individuals with
a higher score.

Next question? Yes.
What drops your score?

Well there are a
number of things,

the big one being of
course terminating a

relationship due to infidelity.

Also, registering
with a lower score individual,

terminating before 12 months,

relationship fraud. All the specifics can
be found here in this pamphlet.

Now kids, it's important
for you to remember that

a higher score today means
a happier tomorrow.

I've seen a lot of people your
age throw caution to the wind.

They didn't take their
score seriously.

And trust me, it's
never pretty sight.

Wow!

Wow, these are really,
really great Ben!

This is interesting, you worked as a
programmer for a little while.

I just needed some
stability, health care.

Honestly this is some
strong work.

Thanks.

Here's the thing. We're not only
looking for someone with a strong eye,

we're also looking for someone who
has great communication skills,

and works well on a team.

I, I agree

which brings me to our
next point, your EI score.

Here origin we have a minimum
EI score requirement for all

incoming employees.

I know my score is a
little on the low side.

Unfortunately it is below the minimum.

Which I, I assure you is just a mistake.

If it is just a mistake, we'll
give you some time to clear it up,

but really only after
that can we

have a serious talk you
joining Origin.

[phone chimes]

<i>A DEI representative will
be with you shortly.</i>

<i>Did you know that individuals with
higher emotional integrity scores</i>

<i>are less likely to
suffer from depression,</i>

<i>anxiety, and other mental illnesses.</i>
Great.

<i>Remember, if you want to
know more, check their score.</i>

<i>Thank you for holding, how can I help you?</i>

Hi, um,

I'm calling because I think you
guys might have made a mistake

on my EI score.

<i>Please hold.</i>

â™ª <i>Take It as It Comes</i> by
Imaginary Future playing â™ª

So, based on everything
you've shared with me

I recommend this
business line of credit.

Okay.

Do I have permission to run
your credit and EI scores?

Yeah, of course.

So, what's the
name of your cafÃ©?

Put this cookie in
your mouth right now.

Really?

No, its called "Friends
In Flour".

I like that one much better.

It was a bad joke but...

how many years have you been operating
or is this a brand new entity?

Brand new.

Congrats.

Okay, well it looks like your

credit history is just
slightly above average.

I racked up a little debt while
I was in culinary school.

Your EI score is actually
pretty good.

So based on these

I am glad to let you know that you've
been approved for a business loan.

Really?
Um, hmm.

Thank you.
Congrats.

Thank you so much!

[whispering?] I got it. or I'm done.

You got it? or Is that it?

I. Am. Finished.

That is part two of
your birthday gift.


Yeah, see look now
when you get into SFU

you're going to be
ready for that cold.

Okay, first, -IF- I get in.

And second, it's not that
cold in San Francisco.

Wait, is it?

I don't know.

I can't believe you made this.

And that you think my
hands are this big.

[Both laugh]

Yeah, actually the first one was
way worse, look at this. Wa Pow!

No, no, no, no, no, it's perfect...
um...

for when I need to chew
off one of my fingers.

Mmm.

Question though.
Yeah.

Where is the other one?

Well, I'm still working on it. But...

I realize that a girl like you
only needs one glove really.

Well, what about my other hand?

That works, right?

Yeah, that works.

Is she leaving?

We just got here!
She said she's not feeling well.

Uh, honey, I love you; but
did you say something?

Of course not, she just...

she got the sense
tonight may be a set up

so she looked up Ben's score.

Oh my God!

Did you tell her that he's our best friend?

Your best friend.

Did you tell her that he's a great
guy and there's a good explanation

for his score? All right,
he was a top programmer

and he's working at Origin now!

Technically I'm still in
the application phase...

don't have a job yet.

Sorry, Ben. I didn't
realize you could hear us.

She just, she's a plus 80 and she said
she doesn't have time for a sub 40.

God this is so awkward.

I'm totally fine.

I meant for me.

Don't feel bad.

It's not you, it's your score.

Okay.

Actually I know
how true that is.

You just...

You need to fix your score Ben.
You're an adult now.

I'm sorry it didn't work out man.

I am totally fine it just
means she's not right for me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

Not right for you?
Are you kidding me?

Her EI score is 82.
Wow

Dating someone like her for a year
will up your score by like 50%.

Okay, but she has apparently already
decided that I am not worthy.

Ben, why are you doing
this to yourself man?

Look at Sandy and I. When we both turned
18 we did everything the right way, Okay?

We followed all the rules, we filed the
proper paperwork and what did that lead to?

I think when you guys
have is so nice.

Both of us being a plus 80's
when our paths finally crossed.

Can you imagine what you have
done if I screwed around

when and I was a sub 60 or 50 when
we met? She would have blown me off.

But look at us now. Right?

We're both plus 90s.

We have a great healthy relationship.
Don't you want that for yourself?

Just make an appointment at the DEI.

Oh, honey, I'm home.

Hey, where you been?

Uh, sorry, me and the guys
met at the happy hour and yep.

Nice! Well I was just trying
to call to let you know that I um..

I got the loan.

Dude..

I know!

I told you it would work out!

Yes. Sir. That is why I...

got you some
beautiful croissants.

Those are apple pie cookies.

Yes, yes they are.

Would you like one?

I'm good but please help yourself.

Okay, I'm celebratin', I'm celebratin'.

Whenever you want to celebrate
with me, I brought one for you.

Thank you!

[phone vibrates]

[phone ringing]

Ben?

Heh, heh, heh, uh, Sarah.

How are you?

Um, good uh sorry I
just... it's been so long

I thought maybe you
called me by accident.

Huh. Believe it or not, I
still have not met another...

Sarah since you.

It's been a while, huh?

<i>Um, actually If you're busy I
can call back another time.</i>

No, its fine. I'm just um
working on a menu.

<i>Oh, for what?</i>

I'm in the process
of opening up a cafÃ©.

That's... amazing.

That's always been your dream.

Congrats.

Thanks.

I actually that's,
that's why I'm calling

<i>Did you know that we filed
conflicting termination reports?</i>

So, uh, it's giving me a
red flag on my record.

<i>I don't know if you
had the same problem.</i>

For a little while, but I started
dating someone so it kind of...

Right, yeah. Look that's really great.

Well mine never improved and
uh I'm up for this job.

So what you need from me?

Uh, would you be uh free sometime this
week to go down to the DEI with me and um.

They need us to be there in
person to work out the details?

I mean I'm pretty
busy lately Ben,

I've got the contractors
coming this week.

I can set up the appointment
it'll only take about an hour.

[she sighs]

I'm sorry to be bringing
up the past but...

I really need this... <i>please.</i>

Uh, Thursday, late afternoon,
I'll meet you there.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Alright I'll see you there.

Oh man even Melissa didn't get in.

She's like the smartest
person I know.

Don't even worry about it
she's book smart you're...

you're Smart smart.


Alright so you ready?

Yeah no, ugh, I don't
know okay you go first.

We promise we do
at the same time.

Okay.

Can you believe they actually
used to do this by mail?

What if we don't get in?

What? No stop.

Be fine okay?

Promise?

Yeah, trust me.

Okay.

[deep breath]

On the count of three, Okay?
Okay.

One.

Two.

Three.

[deep inhale]

[sharp inhale]

<i>Now serving 16 B.</i>

<i>Now serving 17 B.</i>

Ben.

I'm sorry, can you...

I'm sorry I'm late.

Yeah, um [clears throat].

I guess technically
we're both a year late.

Yeah, right.

Thanks for coming.

Sure.

So what's this new job
you have on the line.

Um.

I have an opportunity
at a design firm.

Cool, programming?

Designing, actually.

<i>Now serving 18 A.</i>

Wow!

Well it's good. You always
talked about pursuing that.

Yeah. Talked too much
so I finally go for it.

Are you sure that you
want to do this?

I'm sorry.

I just...

I don't think that I'm going
to ever find anybody like you.

May I interrupt you?

Um, I think I heard enough.

Uh, Mr. Fischer, Mr. Bradley, uh

Thank you for doing your best
to recount your relationship.

I know situations
like this can be

difficult to look at with a clear head and
a clear heart and that's why I'm here.

So based on your testimonies I
am assigning Clint 76% fault

and the remainder to Scott.

But!?

Mr. Bradley, you will most likely find
love with someone else so don't worry.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Mr. Fisher. That's a nice jacket.

Oh I can't believe this.

Thank you.

Confirmation reports will
be sent to you soon.

[door closes]

[door opens with squeak]

Hello.

Hi.

[door closes]

How can I help you.

Yeah, we were in a relationship that
ended a little over a year ago.

Okay.

We submitted termination
reports that we didn't...

exactly sign off
with each other.

Okay, well let's look at
your relationship history.

So you were in a registered
relationship for three years...

You had high numbers in all
relationship categories.

Started to dip towards
the end there.

And you both submitted termination
reports that didn't match.

Right.
Right.

As you know termination reports
must state the same reasons

and be signed off by both parties.
This is common knowledge.

Yeah.

That's right.

Uh, Ben, you reported that
Sarah was at full fault

for the termination
due to infidelity.

Wait, um. We're not, we're not
gonna go with your report are we?

Yeah.

I thought.

Ben that's ridiculous. You
know that's not what happened.

With Peter?

Who's Peter?

Touchy, handsy Peter?

The "I like to touch things
with my hands I'm a chef"?

Peter was a classmate nothing happened.
I've told you this over and over again Ben.

A kiss is nothing?

You kissed Peter?

Okay if you want to go there what
about you and what's her face?

Okay, we're going to
go with my report.

That is the definition
of nothing happened.

Debbie is one of my best friends.

We were close before you and I ever
started dating. You knew that.

You spent the night!

Yeah, that's very inappropriate.

You kicked me-she kicked me out.

What is going on? I thought that
we were gonna settle this today!

I'm not gonna sign off on
something that's not true.

Ben, that would drop my score so
low I'd lose the loan on my cafÃ©.

I am up for an actual
job, not some pipe dream!

I'm sorry.
Wow!

No, that's fine I don't need this.
My score is fine.

I'm sorry.
Good luck Ben.

I...

[door opens]

[door slams]

We'll be right back.

[car starts]

Sarah!

Sarah, wait!

No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

I'm not lettin' go, come on! Please,
please, please come back inside!

[window rolling down]

Please!

Just come back inside.

Get in.

Where are you going?

Get in the car Ben.

Is it in park?

Get in the car!
Okay, all right.

<i>Now serving 20 B.</i>

Well, it's nice to see such a
young couple like you guys.

We're really excited!

Um, so Haley. Uh, you will be attending
college up North this coming year...

And Seth, you will
be here in LA?

We actually applied to the same school
but I, I just can't keep up with her.

Uh, Is this your first long
distance relationship?

Yeah, this is actually both of
our first real relationship period.

Really?

Um. Okay.

Well you know relationships...

are tough but long distance relationships
have their own unique set of challenges.

This is not a light decision.

That's what everyone keeps telling us.

So, are you sure you want to proceed?

Yeah, well we know that
in order to get married,

a relationship has
to be registered for

a minimum of one year. Right? So,
we just want to get a head start.

Nice. You know your stuff.

But just so you know.

Statistically couples
with more life experience

have a lot better chance at
actually getting married.

Yeah but I love her. So isn't
that all that matters?

Plus, like why can't
we be the exception?

Okay, just making sure.

Um, here is a pamphlet with tips on
maintaining a long-distance relationship.

Make sure you read that thoroughly.
Okay. Like thoroughly.

Okay.

Okay?

Your relationship registration
will process in a couple of days.

Congratulations, you are official.

Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

<i>Now serving 21 C.</i>

Hey!

Yeah?

You told him that you love me.

Yeah. Is that okay?

Do you really?

Yeah.

I love you too.

[pleased snortle]

[kissing sound]

Ben we're too old for this.

We owe each other
honesty at least.

Why do you think we broke up?

Yes I knew that Peter
had feelings for me.

And yes I kissed him. But...

It was a tough time for
me with school and...

we were falling apart and I was
weak and I made a stupid mistake.

I just think back to those last six
months and all of those fights

and and and about Peter

and your new schedule.

That wasn't all that was about. It
was about you and Debbie and and you

I just stopped trying...

With us.

It's easier to blame
someone else than...

admit your own faults.

You see that?

That's gonna be my new cafÃ©.

You're short a couple of walls.

[both laugh]

As long as this whole...

reassessment doesn't
mess with things...

I'll help you.

I know how important
this is to you.

And I will not let our past
selves screw everything up.

They really had no idea
what they were doing.

Okay, so you have
both signed off on

50-50 responsibility.

This should significantly
help both of your scores.

The changes should appear on your
records within a day or two.

We did it! Have a nice day.

Hey are you hungry?

You want to grab a bite?

Oh, I've got to go home and check on the
contractors and Jeremy and I have plans.

Right.

It was good to see you.

Yeah.

I'm really glad to hear that
things are going well for you.

Thanks.

Hug.

You know what? Um.

If all goes as planned I'm hoping
to have a soft opening in the fall.

You should come by.

Will you be there?

Uh. Yes.

Oh, well then... count me in.

Okay cool!

Um, I'll send you details
as it gets closer.

Sounds good.

I'm that way.

Yeah, I'm over here.

Okay.

I'm proud of you man.

I really am.

I mean it takes balls to go to after
what you're passionate about.

When are you going to do
the same for your passion?

Whoop!

All come on. Computer programming
is my passion you dick.

Hey Ben. I'm gonna head out do
you have the Spencer account?

Ooh, sorry.

Oh okay. So you're trying to get
me fired is what you're doing.

Ahh, you're doing pretty
good job there by yourself.

Oh. Ouch!

Hey move man.

[both chuckle]

I'm Henry.

Anna.

I'm sort of the reason
Ben's at this job

That is definitely not true.

I thought so. All right.

[clears throat] Well
you're both welcome.

Oh, what are you still doing here?
I thought you had plans tonight.

Uh. Yeah. We are
gonna go to Lupe.

Luma.

Luma.

You should join.

Oh, um, I'm actually hanging out
with my girlfriends tonight.

She's hanging out with herâ€¦

Bring them! We like people.

Um. That place is a plus 80.
Right?

Yeah.

Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

I mean some of the girls
are not quite up there.

I totally understand that.

This guy used to be that guy.

Okay hey so.
Yeah, well um.

Maybe I'll catch you after
I hang out with them.

Uh, yeah. Cool.

Let me know.

Okay. Bye.
See you later.


What's going on here?

I was being charming!

Okay. When are you going to ask her out?
What?

You're not feeling the heat?
You're wearing a sweater.

She was totally into you!

She's a plus 80!?

I mean that is exactly
what you need!

So any girl with a hint of interest
with a good score is my type?

I didn't say your type I
said exactly what you need.

I mean she's cute. She's in your line of work.
I donâ€™t know, maybe she's your type too.

Whatever it is, you
managed to make it weird.

Sorry man.
Come on man.

All my friends are in there.
You can't make an exception?

80's and above, buddy.

I'm a 73 bro, come on.

There's a sub 60 place
around the corner.

Yeah, I know. I was just there.
Your mom says "Hi", bitch.

Your hair look stupid.
Come on.

Cool. You're good.

[tablet bleeping]
You're good.

Oh my God! Do you
remember Diane?

Uh.
From accounting.
Yes.

Weird hair?
Uh, yeah with [unintelligible]
Yes exactly.

They caught her eating a piece
of old cake out of the trashcan.

I miss you at work!

I do not miss that place!

and I love that you're here.

Yeah, this place is so... cool.

Yeah, it just...

It's awesome. Right? Knowing that
everyone here is a quality person.

I don't know man. You're here.

Okay, these people are
not even on my level!

Nobody is. Hey, thank you.
Um-hm.

Um... Here is to...

Movin' up.
Movin' up.
[glasses clink]

Congrats man.

Mmm!

Let me get you another one.

We shall celebrate.
[Unintelligible] It's my round.

Oh, whatever.

Isn't that Anna?

Yeah.
She ditched her friends for you.

And she's in a... she's in a dress.
Okay, alright, I'm gonna go talk to her.

Uh, do you want something from the...?
I want nothing. Ditch me. Ditch me!

Anna.

Hi!
Hey.

Uh, what happened to
girl's night out?

Oh, um, they decided to
go to some sub 40 place.

It's like, they're my friends but I
don't even know why I bother sometimes.

Those places are such
a waste of time.

Oh, but we have the cream
of the crop here. Right?

Well.. Obviously.

Hey... Um....

I'm really glad you're
working at Origin now.

Me too.

And I'm happy we got to meet.

Yeah, I am too.

[glasses clink]

Hi!
Hey!

How's the weather up there?

It's kinda nice.
Wanna check it out?

Yeah!

Alright, so...

Looks like we're all packed up.

Ready?

Yeah.

I'm gonna miss you.

Ah, don't worry about it.

We have a plan. Remember?

I'll be up in a few weeks.

And you promise we'll
video chat every day?

Every day.

Unless you intend on, um, running off to a
frat party to go get drunk or whatever.

I'm not!

I'm purposely not gonna have
a life outside of class.

I'm just gonna study and
talk to you and that's it.

So you're gonna be that weird, creepy girl
in the dorms that never leaves her room?


I'll be that girl... For you.


I love you.

I love you too.

Forever?

Forever.

So have you baked
your entire life?

Since I was a little girl maybe. The apple
pies actually are my grandma's recipe.

Really?

That's why their super tasty. I just
kinda doctor them a little bit.

Um, excuse me one moment.
Thank you so much for coming.
Sure.

Um... You made it!

Yeah.

This place is... finished.

Yeah. It's amazing what can
happen in four months.

It looks great.

Thank you.

Babe, this place is so cute!

Yeah. Isn't it?

Oh Anna, this is Sarah. Sarah
this is my girlfriend Anna.

Hi! It's so nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on the cafÃ©.

Ben's been saying it's a longtime
dream of yours. That is so awesome!

Thank you. It has been.

Oh! There's a bar. Oh, that's so cute.
I'm gonna grab something.

Babe, what do you want?
Uh. B-beer.

Beer? Don't you think wine's a
little bit more appropriate?

[both together slowly]
Uh, yes.

Okay I'll be back.

She seems fun.
Yeah, she's sweet.

Oh. So where's your boyfriend?

Oh, we split up a few months ago

Oh. Uh. Sorry.
Totally fine.

Have you tried anything yet?

Uh, no.
Follow me.

These are yet to be named.
Wait, what are these?

Cranapple oatmeal.
Aw, yes!

These are hands down my fave!

Mmm.

You should consider
calling these "The Ben".

Yeah, I'll think about it.

So, when is the grand opening?

Uh, maybe a month. I mean there's
still some things left to do.

Here you go babe. - Oh.
See now its an opening.

Yeah, my beer-wine!

So, here is to a very sweet
and very successful future.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

Oh no I was just telling

Ben that I really want to do
something with this wall. I just...

don't know what.

I could see a mural here.

Yeah, that would be perfect!

Well I could work on something.
Oh, no. That's too much trouble.

No it wouldn't be at all.

You have time for that? With
everything that's going on at Origin?

It, it's really too much to ask.

It would be no problem.

Ben, I'll definitely
let you know.

Okay.

And in the meantime I could definitely
use both of your help eating these.

This place needs a sky.

Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Is this about me helping Sarah?
'Cause... I don't have to.

I'm sorry. I should've asked
you before I offered.

I can just tell her that I
don't have time for it.

No, no that's okay. I mean you
guys were a long time ago.

I have nothing to worry about.
Right?

Of course not.
Promise?
Yes.

Alright. Bye babe.

Hey! Seth.
Hi.

I thought I gave you the day off.
Did you say that?

Uh, I'm closing early. I'm meeting up with
Ben to go over the plans for the mural.

Yeah, you probably forgot because I mentioned it
when you were on the phone with your girlfriend.

Uh, sorry about that.
You're fired.

I'm just kidding.

I remember that feeling.
Hey, see you Monday?

Yeah. Sounds cool.

Hey um. You and Ben...
Yeah?

Used to date. Right?

Is that what he told you?
Yeah, we used to.

So isn't that like weird?
Seeing him again.

No, no. It was a long time ago.
We're friends.

It's just that's so
weird to me because...

The way Haley makes me
feel when I see her I just.

I can't see that ever going away.
You know?

Well it does.

I did not mean you and Haley.

I'm so sorry. No,
I just meant...

you know as you get older it's a
lot easier to control that stuff.

Maybe.

But, even if you could control it
doesn't mean it's not there, right?

Okay guys, I know we
covered a lot today.

So if you have any questions, please
stop by my office hours. Okay?

It's always open. I'll know if you
don't come, 'cause I'm always there.

Okay. Alright guys,
see you next week.

Oh, and for you
adventurous ones...

I'm having a info session for
the study of raw program.

I'll have it right after if you
want to stick around. Okay?

Hey man. Good job buddy.
Thank you.

All right. See you guys.

Oh Haley!
Yeah.

I just wanted to let you know your last
couple of papers have been really good.

Oh, thank you.

You know, you definitely write the
most mature for an undergrad.

Are you calling me an old lady?

I didn't want to say it at first.
But yes.

Thanks. See ya.

Oh, hey!
Yeah?

Are you going to stick
around for the info session?

Uh, I actually have to pick someone up.
Aw, come on, it'll be really quick.

You won't regret it.

Okay.
All right. Cool.

There's like three of you.

I'll take it.

â™ª Darling you can

â™ª Any time you hear the doorâ™ª
[door closes]

â™ª Cause I can't wait... â™ª

I'm so sorry I'm late.
I had a crazy day.

[seatbelt clicks]
â™ª Ooh, this is real love â™ª

I sent you texts.

Well, I was driving,
and I was almost here.

â™ª this is real love
Ooh, this is... â™ª

I just...

have a really busy weekend and I had
to rush to get a bunch of stuff done

before you got here, so can you at
least be grateful that I made time?

Well you could've at least told me this
about a week and I wouldn't have come up.

Well, last time I suggested
pushing back a week,

You are not exactly happy about it
soâ€¦ Don't say it unless you mean it.

Well I can't help feeling that I'm
less of a priority. I'm trying here.

I'm trying too.

So my friends are going to the city.
There's this free music festival going on.

Do you want to go?

Um, can we take a nap first?

Well they're leaving in about
10 minutes and I'm not tired.

Yeah but I've been up since like 6 AM
trying to get up here. So I'm kinda tired.

I know, but I thought maybe we could just
go, and you can I don't know, relax there.

I come up here for us to have
a little bit of like time together

and you just want to ditch
me with your friends?

I don't want to ditch you. I
want you to come with me.

Huh. Why can't we just have
a little bit of alone time?

Like, we barely get to see each other.
You see them every day.

Okay. Sorry, I just
thought it would be fun.


Hey, um, we could still
have fun here. Right?

What, what do you want to do?
[Haley exhales]

Okay. Um...

Oh, um, actually I did want to try
this new place on University Ave.

And they were handing out
coupons on the quad today soâ€¦

Maybe if I can find those you
can eat there if you're hungry

And then um, oh that movie
I really wanted to s... see

Haley, everyone's ready to go.

Um.
Are you guys coming?
Yeah, just, just give me a second.

What happened to him?

He's just tired.
Come on.

[door closes]

Man this stuff looks brand-new.
Well it is.

I never used it. I don't
plan on using it.

I don't know why I bought it.
Painting is hard.

Well thanks. I'll have this
back to you in about a week.

Used.
Yeah totally. Cool man.

So this is like a... a pretty
extensive project, huh?

Sort of. It's just a
lot of moving pieces.
Yeah.

You guys it's been spending
a lot of time... together.

You know subtlety has
never been your strength.

What are you doing man? I mean,
what you have with Anna is so good.

And she could totally use something
like this against you if you terminate.

Sandy almost wouldn't let
me lend you this stuff.

Hi Sandy!

You're like, camouflaged
against that house over there.

No one is terminating, man.
Nothing is happening!

All right. Just as long as you're
being honest with yourself.

Actions don't follow too far
from what's in the heart.

Sandy told me to say that.

I really love it so far.
Yeah were almost done.

I can come again tomorrow night.
Oh great!

Um, here take my
spare set of keys.

What, you're not
going to be here?

Well, I have to wake up
at three to bake so no.

 - Stupid.

You should take a picture and send
it to Anna. It's really good.

Oh, yes good idea!

God, I wish this was
a bar, not a bakery.

Kill for a beer.

Well you know what?
I don't have beer,

but if you're interested I do
have something a little stronger.

Like a secret stash? [laughing]

You know that I started
drinking scotch because of you?

You mean that in a
good way, right?

Because I really hope I didn't turn
you to drink after we broke up.

I know it was difficult to lose me.
Oh my God, shut up!

Oh!

This is to the DEI.
Why?

Well if you think about it
they sort of got us here andâ€¦

I for one am happy we got a
second chance to sort things out.

Me too.
[glasses clink]
Clink!

No seriously, I'm not
talking about every chef...

Has some story about how their
early creations tasted awful butâ€¦

You never made one
thing I didn't like.

Bullshit, Ben!
I know what I made.

Well maybe I'm simple,
but, I liked it all.

Yeah well Ben you like the powdered
sugar donuts that come in six packs.

Oh yes!
Pastries should not come
in cardboard six packs!

Hey, you should sell those here!

You need to leave.
Ahh!
You need to leave.

I can't move.
Ahh!

You did it.

I am so proud of you.

Well, assuming I don't
close in a year.

Oh shut up!
It's possible.

This place is gonna be a hit.

If not for the food, then for the
hot owner behind the counter.

You know that's why used to come back
to that restaurant you used to work at.

Well, not all guys are as
dumb and shallow as you.

Oh, but they are! [laughing]

You know what's funny?

When we were together I used to
picture this moment... with you in it.

And then we broke up andâ€¦

I stopped envisioning it that
way, I just... removed you.

And now in the end, you're...
actually here.

It's funny.

I never left.

I'm sorry.

[cell phone ringing]

Hello.
Hey, what are you up to?

Um, I have practice. What's up?

All right, I have some awesome
news for you. Are you ready?

Yeah, what's up?

<i>So,</i> I just got back
from my academic advisor

And I'm officially transferring
to Goldengate college next year.

Wait. What?

<i>So they bumped me
up on the waitlist</i>

and all I gotta do is keep up my
credits and my GPA and I'm in.

Isn't that awesome?
Um, yeah. That's, that's great babe.

Yeah, I'm just gonna be
like 30 minutes away.

Yo! Why are you so quiet?

I was expecting you to be
going like nuts right now.

I'm sorry. I'm, I'm really
excited for you. I'm just...

I'm just surprised. I thought we said
that you're coming up after second year.

Yeah but I was working my ass off
so we don't have <i>to go throughâ€¦</i>

<i>Another year of long distance.</i>

Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah no um. Hey
let's just talk about this later.

Okay, um, I'm kind of...

Alright, yeah.
Okay, alright, I love you.

Yeah, I love you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

So, what are you doing this weekend?
Nothing. Why?

The guys from the other team are Sigma's
and they invited us to a party.

Do you want to go?
I don't know if I should.

Come on! You never
come out with us.

I'd be a bad friend if I never
got you out this whole year.

Please! Come on it'll
be so much fun!

Okay. Yeah.
Wait, I didn't expect that.

Yeah.
What?

Stop!
Everyone she's going to a party!
It's no big deal! Stop!

This is bad
I know.

If I don't draw more
energy cards I am screwed.

What you did is beyond bad.

I know, I'm gonna fix it.
I have to fix it.

What did you expect man?

Oh I'm gonna spend night and
day with my ex-girlfriend,

Working on a fun and exciting new
project that I'm sure won't lead to us

Reigniting our feelings
for each other.

I warned you not to put
yourself in this position.

It's not like a planed for this to
happen when we started the project.

If you knew what was
happening, why'd you go back?

I guess it, it's not like
were getting another chance.

There's maybe a chance
I always wanted it.

What are you guys talking about?

Uh, just girl problems.

It's hopefully something you won't
have to deal with for a long time.

I have a girlfriend. I know
all about girl problems.

Okay no, you do not have a girlfriend, kid.
What are you, like 10?

I'm eight.
I'm losing to an eight-year-old.
Humbling isn't it?

Ben, you do not have a girl problem.
You have a girl... situation.

It hasn't turned
into a problem yet.

I have to terminate with Anna.
I have to.

You've been together
for less than a year.

If you terminate now you can kiss
your score and Origin goodbye.

Everything you've worked
for... out the window.

I can't stay with her. Okay?

What am I gonna lie to her?
That would make me a fr...

a dishonest person.
Oh, so now you're worried about honesty.

Look I'm not saying you guys
have to stay together forever.

Just you know, long enough
so if you guys break up,

you're not can have a
huge hit on your score.

You're not helping yourself or
Sarah if you terminate now.

I win!
Let's go again.

But I'm tired.
You're eight. What you tired from?

Beating you.

Hey.
Hey, you're early!

Yeah, I sort of
wanted to talk first.

Is now a good time?
Yeah.

I'm just, uh prepping for our
reception tomorrow night.

So what's up?

I wanted to talk
about last night.

Right. Uh.

Ben, before we get into it.
Anna, I'm sorry.

I know that it wasâ€¦

It was what?

Out of line?

And I wanted to apologize.

But look, I want to finish
this mural with you andâ€¦

I wasn't sure what you thought.

Maybe we should...
have some space.

Because otherwise things could get complicated
when they really don't need to be.

The things like last night?

Yeah.

It was my fault. I drank too much andâ€¦
Ben it's fine!

If we let ourselves slip a little
bit it's nothing more than that.

Right?

Right.

Okay.

So I'd... talk to
you later then.

â™ª <i>Til'</i> by DANakaDAN playing â™ª

What!
Oh my God I got a [unintelligible]!

[excitedly laughing
and cheering]

In-your-face. Isn't
this so much fun?

It is, actually. Thank you.
I really needed this!

I think those guys
are checking us out.

Really?

Yeah, yeah make me laugh 'cause I
look really cute when I laugh.

Okay, okay I um, I justâ€¦
[forced laughter]

I didn't say anything yet.
Laugh with me so I don't look crazy.

[forced laughter]

You're really bad at this.

Sorry.
Haley!

Jay!

Yo! Haley!



Hey, do you know
where Haley's at?

Who me?
Yeah.
Uh, no, she's not here.

Do you know where she went?

Aw, Jesus.

I shouldn't say anything. Um.
She went out with Tiff.

Please don't ask me
where they went.

Why? Where'd they go?

Oh, Jesus Christ.

They went to a Sigma party.

It's a score the score night.
It's not?

Here you go.
Thank you.

So, do you know any of
the guys in this frat?

Um, kind of, I mean
they invited us here.

Why?
Yeahâ€¦

You probably shouldn't be
hanging out with those guys.

They make their pledges do this
awful thing called score the score.

Haley?
Seth?

What are you doing here?

Boyfriend?
Yeah.

Hey I'm Jay.

Seth! Oh my God, oh my God!

Stop Seth stop!
Oh please Seth calm down!

What are you doing?

This asshole's just
trying to sleep with you!

No he's not!

They just bring registered girls
here so they can hook up with them.

I was just explaining
that to her.

Jay's my TA. Okay? He was
just trying to help.

Good?

Yeah.

What hell are you doing at
a party like this anyways?

I didn't know, I promise.

Let's go. Now!

What? What, why?
Let's go.

Do you remember where Henry
said the restaurant is?

Aw, dang it my phone just died!

Uh, I'll look it up.

So I heard the other
designers talking about you.

Really?
Yeah, they really like you.

I can totally see you getting
promoted as lead designer soon.

Which would be awesome
because then I can quit!

What do you mean?

Well, after we get married I'd want to
stay home and take care of the kids.

It's a full-time job.

Anna.

Baby! I'm totally kidding!

I don't want kids anytime soon.
Don't freak out.

Come on. I'll navigate.


[phone vibrates]

How are things going
with Sarah's project?

Uh, pretty good. She really likes it.
I should be done this week.

Anything happen between you two?

What do you mean?

[car door closes]

I've been meaning to talk
to you about this all week

Were you physical?

We had a drink to celebrate
the other night andâ€¦

We got a little tipsy
and we kissed.

But it's the only time
that ever happened.

Oh well thank God because then
you'd really be messed up.

Anna, I'm sorry.
No! You lied to me!

From the very beginning you told
me I had nothing to worry about!

You made me look like an idiot! I knew
I shouldn't have trusted that bitch.

Sarah would neverâ€¦
Do not defend her right now!

Take me home. I want to
file for termination.

[car door opening]

[car door slams]

Hey. Where were you?

Just got breakfast
with some friends.

Why didn't you wake me up?
It's not like you would've come.

Why are you going
through my stuff?

It was right on top of your desk.
That's not going through anything.

Am I not allowed to know that my
girlfriend is going to London?

I haven't decided yet.
Why didn't you tell me?

I was going to, Iâ€¦
But you never even mentioned it.

It's just something I'm looking into. I
haven't even decided if I'm gonna go.

Why do you have everything planned out?
Like where you wanna live? Classes?

It's a really amazing
opportunity.

What! What the hell? Do youâ€¦

Do you know how hard I've been working
to save up to move up here? No!

I never ask you to do that.
Huh, wow!

Well, I'm sorry for
trying to make this work.

Huh!

Okay, you know what? I'm
trying really hard too.

Okay, you're the one making all these plans and
decisions and you never asked me about them.

You never asked to come up.
You just comeâ€¦

and then I'm expected to just
clear my entire schedule

because you never wanna do
anything with my friends.

And now this whole you're
transferring early thing?

So spending time with me is
an inconvenience to you?


No, I never said that. I just...
need some space sometimes.

To live my life up here.

Well, I can help you with that.


We're going to get caught!

So what? If we get kicked out
we'll just climb right back up.

They're going to fine you.
I'll take extra shifts.

This is so crazy! I love it!

This weekend went by too fast. I'll
have to take you home with me.

Take me everywhere with you.


[door opening]

Excuse me.
Hi. What can I get for you?

Are you Ms. Hayashi?
Yes.

If you have a few minutes we'd
like to ask you some questions.

What is this about?

We're with the DEI fraud
inspections division.

[phone chimes]

Hey, can I ask you a question?

Yeah, sure. What's on your mind?

Did you ever feel like nothing's
going according to plan?

Well, today kind of felt like that.
And yesterday too.

and the day before that. So yeah,
I think I know the feeling.

I just, I really believed things
would be going a certain way.

But now everything's
just falling apart.

Are we talking about
your boyfriend?

Yeah.
Yeah, Sorry about that.

We registered before we came here.
We were so sure.

But nowâ€¦
But now you're not so sure.

Look, Haley. Having a plan doesn't
always mean having control.

That's just life.
Yeah.

Now, learning how to move forward
when you don't have that control...

That's growing up.

Sounds like you know a lot about that.
Yeah.

Yeah it does. Doesn't it?

You'll be okay. More than okay.

See you Thursday?

You know I wish I could say
you weren't a good fit here.

But, the truth is we just, we
have to follow our guidelines.

Terminating your relationship

will unfortunately bring your score back
down below our minimum requirement here.

I understand.

I'm really sorry Ben.

Letting people go is never easy.

But it's my job,

and if I have to do it,

I usually tell myself that they
were always meant something else.

Ben.

You know I didn't
want this to happen.

Anna, this is...

Far from your fault.

I'm sorry, I lost sight of us.

I kept things from you.

I did it because I
was weak and afraid.

I'm sorry.

I didn't file my termination report.

[phone vibrating]

Haley.
Seth, Hey!
Hi.

<i>I'm so glad you called.</i>

Yeah, um, I'm sorry.
I, it's just...

It's been a really weird
time and I was justâ€¦

<i>Doing some thinking.</i>

Hey, yeah me too. It's fine.

Are you doing right now? Um.

<i>Can you talk?</i>

I'm actually just getting
dropped off at the airport.

What are you doing at the airport?

I'm flying up to see you, babe.

What?

I thought it would just be faster to
fly up and work this out in person.

Seth? Look, you're doing it again.
Okay? You're, you're makingâ€¦

decisions for us and just assuming
that I'll be fine with it.

Yeah, but you weren't
answering your phone.

And what's wrong with
me wanting to see you.

You don't get it. I mean,
it's, it's not aboutâ€¦

Seeing each other. Okay? It's aboutâ€¦

growing with each other. And right
now we're not growing because

<i>you're the only one making any decisions
for how this relationship is working</i>

And every time I try to tell you thatâ€¦
So I'm just holding you back?

You just get upset.

Babe, we'll just talk about
this in person. Okay?

Seth, don't get on the plane.
Okay? Justâ€¦

Please, please don't come up.

Why not?

I think we should stop
seeing each other.

What are you trying to say? Like...

Like no more visiting, or...

just wait till you come
back for summer, right?

No.

Like... I think we should terminate.

What? No! <i>Haley stop! What?</i>

<i>Please, not like this,
not over the phone.</i>

Just give me two hours. I'll be right
 over to work this out. Okay?
Seth, Seth stop.

I, I can't do this anymore.
Okay?

I mean, we're not the same people.
We're not living the same lives.

I mean, don't you see?

But I love you.

Our love isn't the same either.

I'm sorry.

Ben!
Sarah are you okay?

What are you doing here?

Well I've been calling
but you didn't pick up.

Because I didn't
want to talk to you.

Totally fair.

Look, I, I know that you are...

pissed at me and I am sorry.

This is not about you, Ben.
Just let me finish. Okay?

This is important.
I am an idiot.

Okay?

Anna found out what happened between
us and was about to terminate with me.

I would've lost my job,
her, my score everything.

She wanted to give
me another chance.

But I told her no.

Because it wouldn't be right.

It wouldn't be fair. Because Iâ€¦

want to be with you.

Sarah.

It was only supposed
to be one year.

No strings attached.

I'm sorry. What?

When you and I broke up.

The thought of opening this place was
the only thing that kept me going.

I needed a loan. But my score was too low
so I had to find a way to raise it. Quick.

Jeremy was...

just a friend but he...

had this idea...

something he had done before...

Sarah, what are you saying?

I faked my score.

I know it's fraud but it's not
like anyone was gonna get hurt.

What happens now?

It's all over.

With the penalties I'm a sub 20 now
so the bank is retracting my loan.

They're taking it all back.

Not to mention the fines. So...

I have nothing.

We'll figure this out together.
No, I'll figure this out.

I was fine before you came
back into the picture.

It's because I helped you with your score they
looked into my record again in the first place.

This relationship keeps
coming back to haunt me.

I'm done, Ben.

What about what I just said?

What that now you want me
because you have nothing left?

No, that is not what I meant.
I, look if anything... I...

I loved you so much, Ben.

It was hard enough when we terminated.
And these last few monthsâ€¦

I let you back in.

And you tell me it was all a mistake?

You make me feel so stupid.

And now you're back and you want to fight
for me? Oh, I'm sorry it's too late.

Look, I know that I hurt you but...

What if this happened for a reason? You
know, now we can have another chance.

Oh.

Look at us Ben.

Our lives are shit.
Our scores are shit.

I mean do you honestly think that getting
back together right now is a great idea?

Yes.
How do you know that?

Because I love you.

I don't love you anymore Ben.

No one ever told me
this was an issue.

I'm sorry, but as I said,
it's a policy of the program.

What does my EI score have
to do with my education?

I mean my GPA dropping or not having
enough credits fine but this is absurd.

As I said, I am sorry

but the list of eligible
students is quite long so

all things must be
taken into account.

Although only slightly lower,

no other student had
anything on their records.

Remember what I said about having a plan
doesn't always mean having control?

Who know, you know maybe...
this is the start of something new.

something...

better.

Well...

I, I thought...

Haley.

[phone vibrating]

Hey.

Hey. Haley.

I did notâ€¦ I didn't
think you'd pick up

Guess I thought it'd be
nice to hear your voice.

Yeah. Just weird not
talking to you anymore.

It'll be normal someday.

What if I don't want it to?

Seth.

We can't.

I know, I know, I know.

It's just I was feeling kind of down and...

Every time I'd felt that way I
would just call you. It's justâ€¦

Yeah, but.

We're not together anymore.

Wow. Yeah. Thank you...

for that reminder
Haley because I

totally forgot that you broke
up with me over the phone.

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

No, it's okay.

I'm sorry too.

Hey, are you still
gonna move up here?

You were so the
only reason so...

Especially now that you're
moving to London <i>I reallyâ€¦</i>

I really don't see the point.

I'm not going anymore.

Wait what?

Our termination
dropped my scoreâ€¦

And apparently they consider
that for the program.

Isn't there anything
you could do?

I don't know.

This is it.

I can't believe we're doing this.
You're sure, right?

Of course. I love you.

<i>Now serving 03 B.</i>

Oh that's us!

Seth?

Hey. Ben. Right?

Yeah. What are you doing here?

Oh, I'm sorry, man.

First one?

First one's always the hardest.

I just feel so stupid.

I know.

<i>Now serving 05 C.</i>

I really thought that me and
Haley could beâ€¦ Forever.

I believed that we
could be an exception.

To what?

To everything that people told
us when we first registered.

I thought we'd outlast all the
doubts, all the distance...

All the warnings about young
love. Butâ€¦ We couldn't.

We weren't the exception. We
were just another example.

There's nothing wrong
with being wrong man.

You're supposed
to make mistakes.

You're supposed to get hurt.
That's what love is.

Especially young love.

Wellâ€¦ That does not matter now.

None of it does.

The scores only going to prove that.
No.

The score only shows you
what happened. Notâ€¦

Did you really love her?

Yeah.

Thenâ€¦

End things in a way that's
worthy of that love.

That might make it forever.

<i>Now serving 07 D.</i>

Okay, wellâ€¦

After reviewing your report and
evaluations of relationship metricsâ€¦

I will be assigning 82% of responsibility
on Haley and the remainder to you.

Is this valuation correct?

Seth?

No.

I'd like to take
full responsibility.

Um..
Seth?

You do understand that this would
significantly lower your score, Right?

Yeah, I know.

I want to do this.

Okay.

Ben.

Good luck.

<i>Now serving 06 C.</i>

Busy day for you.
A bit out of the ordinary, yes.

So, why am I being audited?

My relationship with Sarah was way
before Jeremy was ever in the picture.

It's a standard DEI protocol.

In EI score fraud cases we

Uh, do background investigations

on the accused past relationships
to rule out further collusion.

In other words we want to make sure your
relationship with Sarah was legitimate.

Shouldn't you have this
information in your system?

Well we have statistics and data
but there are certainâ€¦ Limits.

That's one way to put it.

You are aware that this
interview is being recorded?

How long will this take?
Because I have to head toâ€¦

Oh wait, absolutely nothing!

Thanks to the DEI I don't
have a job anymore.

Well then we'll make this quick.

So, when you first met Sarah, was
it arranged by any third parties?

Yep, I was on a blind
date with a third partyâ€¦

She crashed it; then I
couldn't stop thinking about her.

Was there any money exchanged?
Yeah.

Was this money exchanged in agreement for
any fraudulent relationship activity?

I was paying for my date's dinner.

Okay Mr. Soo, I would appreciate it
if you took this audit seriously.

If we can't determine whether your
relationship with Sarah was real,

you could also be penalized.

What happens when
my score hits zero?


Can you please describe your
relationship with Sarah?

[door opening]

[door closing]

So I've confirmed your relationship
with Ben was legitimateâ€¦

But, uh, unfortunately all
current penalties will remain.

I understand.

What did he say?

He said the right things.

Is he okay?

Yeah he's fine.

[door opening]

[door closing]

Sarah!

Um.

I'm not legally allowed to do this but
uh, this is a recording of the audit.

I uh think you should have it.

Thanks.

Yeah.

<i>Can you please describe your
relationship with Sarah?</i>

We were...

Flawed andâ€¦

So flawed.

At the same time we were
oddly perfect. Justâ€¦

Couldn't separate the two so
that destroyed us in the end.

I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

But if you think about it, that forced
her into this entire situation.

<i>It was no reason for
anyone to commit EI fraud.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Sarah made a mistake.</i>

<b>She made a bad call. Who hasn't?</b>

She wouldn't've had to resort to
it if it weren't for me. If, if...

If I hadn't let her go...

If I had...

fought for us.

<i>Well, perhaps you should just look past
this and focus on the future of your score.</i>

<i>[forceful exhale] My score...</i>

I'm sorry, my score does not reflect
how much I can love someone...

even after they're out of my life.

You and the DEI can give people
whatever number you want, but...

we make the mistakes.

We should be allowed to take risks

and fail and love without
a score to consider.

<i>The system simply exists
to minimize risks</i>

<i>and potential emotional
damage between couples.</i>

That's too bad.

You guys...

try to make love easier, but
you're missing the whole point.

It's not supposed to be...

easy.

It's supposed to test you,

break you down,

and hurt like hell.

The we who choose to
go through that way.

That's what's really important.

Ben?

Sarah!

What are you doing here?

I just uh...

wanted to finish this.

You know they sold the place. Right?

Yeah.

So that's it, huh?

Um, I guess I should give
these back to you then.

[keys jingle]

Alright. Um...

Thanks.

So. How have you been?

Getting by. I guess.

You?

Oh, you know, just giving
myself some time off.

We don't stand a chance
out there do we?

Two sub 30s.

What do you think her score is?

I don't think she cares.

It's a shame we didn't
get to finish it.

We could... finish it now.

What if...

we start over?

These are all for me. Right?

Don't tell my co-workers.

Oh, by the way, everything,
everything looks great here.

You know, I mean, you guys have
nearly perfect credit and EI

scores are just gonna make the
loan process go by so smoothly.

Do you have any experience
running a cafÃ©?

We don't.

But we have someone in mind
who'd be perfect for the job.

Yes, we do.
