â€ Swish, swish, bish.

It's me, Sarah.

And I am so fucking sick
of thinking

about stupid Brett Kavanaugh.

Honestly, if I think
of his frowny pink face

and his Pert Plus hair
one more time, I'm gonna puke.

Trump even held a ceremony
for Kavanaugh

where he apologized
on behalf of the nation,

declared victory, as always,
and added:

â€ You, sir,
under historic scrutiny,

were proven innocent.

â€ And you, sir,
under historic scrutiny,

will be poopin' in a cell.

I'm very proud of that.

So now Kavanaugh's on the court
and ready to decide the case

of "tastes great"
versus "less filling."

What's even more upsetting
is the GOP is seeing

an actual bump
from this Kavanaugh shit.

â€ The Kavanaugh bump is real.

â€ Shut up, dummy.

God, I wish I could get through

to the 52% of white women

who put Trump in office,
but they areâ€â€

they're too far gone.

So, instead, I am looking
to young people.

Young Thug.

Young Dolph.

Lil Pump.

Lil Uzi Vert.

But also young people
who aren't rappers.

Because only 23%
of young people voted at all

in the 2014 midterms.

And I know you don't want
to hear this from me,

your Auntie Sarahâ€â€
who happens to have

a cherry bomb of a caboose,
by the wayâ€â€

so take it from your buddy
Taylor Swift.

Tâ€Swift has never
been political before,

but this week,
she went on Instagram

and said she would vote
for two Democrats in Tennessee,

and it is a very big deal,

because Taylor has
a massive amount of reach.

She has 112 million
Instagram followers.

She's not just a pop star,

she has the following
of two Italys.

And Republicans'
kneeâ€jerk reaction, of course,

is to tell her
to stay out of politics.

Hey. You can't give Kanye a
free ticket to the White House

and then tell Taylor
to stay in her lane.

They are both
taxpaying citizens.

They can talk about
whatever they want.

You know who should shut up?
Tax dodgers.

Which would be great,
because then we wouldn't

have to hear from big fat
President Dumbshit.

And yes, Taylor's a little late
to the game

and waited until the American
leg of her tour was over

to speak up, but hey,
better late than never,

ever getting back together.

Fuck, her songs are so catchy.

Look what you made me do.

â€ Hi. It's me.

Wow.

What an attractive audience.

I'm gonna have to take a cold
shower before the monologues.

Oh, there's no time?
That's okay.

I'll do it horny.


I want to talk to you guys
about climate change.

Wait, don't switch over
to "Bosch"!

Hurricane Michael
just happened.

It's the third
most powerful storm

ever on record to hit the U. S.

It was big.
It was on every channel.

But you know what is not
on every channel?

The reason these storms
are getting more powerful

and more frequent.

God punishing gays.


No, it's climate change.
It's climate change.

And I know climate change
is not the most exciting issue,

and the media knows it too,

which is part of why
it's covered so infrequently.

Here is MSNBC anchor
Chris Hayes

responding to the question
of why he's not airing

more segments
on climate change.

You know what's
a great incentive?

We're all gonna fucking die.

How about that
for an incentive?


Look, my show would get
better ratings

if I just described the dongs
of dudes I've dated.

But climate change
is an emergency,

and one you definitely will not
get a presidential alert for.

So maybe this gets shared
a little less than normal,

but I feel compelled to use
my platform to speak out.

Granted, my platform is on
the thirdâ€largest

streaming network of three.


So it's not so much
shouting from the rooftops

as, like, complaining
at an open mic at Panera Bread.


Still, this is happening,
so put down

your broccoli cheddar soup
and buckle up.

This past week, the UN's
intergovernmental panel

on climate changeâ€â€
let's call it IPCCâ€â€

released a report showing
that, on our current path,

we will face apocalyptic levels
of flooding,

wildfires, and famine by 2040.

Which is not just
in our lifetime,

but really fucking soon.

It's 2040!

Cardi B will be, likeâ€â€
ew, my age, gross.


I know there are
so many problems right nowâ€â€

you know, people can't
afford rent

and face crushing student loan
debt and medical bankruptcy.

White supremacy is being
further entrenched

by a far rightâ€wing government.

Taco Bell still hasn't made
the Naked Chicken Chalupa

a permanent menu item.

But we cannot ignore the meteor
hurtling towards Earth

just because our house
is on fire.

2018 is on track
to be the fourth hottest year

in recorded history.

You want to guess
what the first, second,

and third hottest years are?

Too late, it was
the last three years.

This is fucking happening,

despite what
Fox News grandpas think.

Unfortunately, a Fox News
grandpa is our president.

â€ So Obama's talking
about all of this

with the global warming
and theâ€â€

a lot of it's a hoax,
it's a hoax.

I mean, it's
a moneyâ€making industry, okay?

â€ Yeah, it's a hoax,
like Sandy Hook

or the Holocaust
or you making women cum.


You know, one of those hoaxes
that 97%

of the world's scientists
are in cahoots on.

I don't think I've ever said
the word "cahoots" before.

Cahoots, it sounds Yiddish.

I think it's a Yiddish word
for having diarrhea

in a public square.


Look, the Paris Agreement
was meant to keep

global warming
to under 2.6 degrees.

Even in the unlikely event
we hit that target,

there is a good chance
we are totally fucked

and we cannot get unâ€fucked.

â€ Excuse me, Sarah?

Hi, I'm a dumb guy,

and I'm having trouble
following all these stats

on account of
my oatmealâ€like brain.

â€ Oh, right, okay.

Two point six degrees

does not sound like a big deal.

You need something
more visceral.

â€ Visceral? Sorry.

My vocabulary is very not big.

Again, I'm an idiot.

â€ Got it. You need to hear what
bad things are gonna happen.

You know how Miami is a city?

â€ Yeah.

â€ It's going to instead
be the ocean.

â€ Awesome.

Like my favorite movie,
"Waterworld."

â€ Oh, you have bad taste,
'cause you're dumb.

â€ Bingo. Bingo, bingo.
SARAH: Okay.

How about this?

New York City will be as hot
as the tropics,

and the tropics
will grow so hot,

they will be uninhabitable.

Hurricanes and typhoons
and wildfires

will just become the weather.

Tens of millions
of climate refugees

will have to flee their homes

because of rising sea levels
or famine.

And for those of you
with no empathy,

that's not just in
other places.

It's here.

As all of Earth gets as hot

as subâ€Saharan Africa,

mosquitoes will spread
across the globe,

infecting as many as 5 billion
people with malaria.

â€ I just shit my pants.

â€ Yeah,
it's fucking scary stuff.

â€ I'm gonna go check
on my pants.

â€ Sounds like a plan.

You know, the last time
there was this much

climate change
in a short period,

it led to mass extinction
that killed 97%

of all life on Earth.

Meanwhile,
the Trump administration's

official response to all of it
is, "Fuck it."

They're actually pushing
for more

environmental deregulation.

Why? Because they're protecting
the interests

of a very small group
of absurdly rich

and powerful people.

According to "The Guardian,"

71% of global carbon emissions

stem from just 100
corporations.

That's it, just 100
giant billionaire businesses

that filled the right pockets
to get the devil's job done.

Our only chance for survival
is an aboutâ€face,

investing in renewable energy,

which would not only
save the planet

but create an incredible boom
in jobs.

You know, California
incentivized clean energy

and, as a result, now has
eight and a half green jobs

for every one job
in fossil fuels.

Yet, the Trump administration
is actually suing to stop them.

Please follow the money
on that one.

So should we all just assume

we're truly and properly
fucked?

I mean, yes.

Sorry.

It's just,
it would be disingenuous

to sugarcoat it.

At the same time,
we cannot give up,

because fighting their nihilism
with more nihilism

is what they're banking on.

If we don't fight
these 100 corporations,

they get their money,
and we get to die.

And the fucking disgusting
irony of it, of all of it,

is that the billionaires
who have created

this global atrocity are gonna
be the ones to survive it.

They're gonna be fine.

While we all cook to death
in a planetâ€sized hot car,

they will be safe
in their Martian bioâ€dome,

stuffing robot sex slaves
in their penthouse fuck suite.


So the only option is we react
to this massive

state of emergency
with massive action.

We should be doing the opposite

of every single thing
this administration is doing.

The world has to come together
to fight

this manâ€made apocalypse,
or we are fucked.

â€ We can't be consumed

by our petty differences
anymore.

We will be united
in our common interests.

â€ Wow, that was so,
like, not dumb.

â€ We will, once again,
be fighting for our freedom.

Not from tyranny, oppression,

or persecution,
but from annihilation.

And should we win the day,
the fourth of July

will no longer be known
as an American holiday.

â€ Wait. This is the speech from
the end of "Independence Day."

â€ Yeah, but it's
really good, and...

â€ I mean, swap aliens
for climate change

and it's pretty much the sameâ€â€
it's the same movie.

Wait, just finish it.
Finish your speech.

â€ Really?
SARAH: Yeah.

We're all gonna die anyway.

â€ We will not go quietly
into the night.

We will not vanish
without a fight.

We're going to live on.

We're going to survive.

Today, we celebrate
our Independence Day!

[cheers and applause]

â€ We'll be right back...
or will we?

â€ I was recently a guest

on "The Last Word
with Lawrence O'Donnell."

Oh, you don't believe me?

Well, you're gonna look
so dumb,

'cause I got video proof.

Watch this.

<i>[percussive music]</i>

â€ Welcome back.
These days, so much

of our political conversation

happens on Twitter,

but what does this intersection

of politics and social media

mean for our culture?

We're joined by our panelists
in Los Angeles,

actor, comedian, and
politically active Twitter user

Sarah Silverman.

And the rightâ€wing
Twitterverse's

newest superstar

Brambi Streeter.

Brambi, let's start with you.

Earlier this week,
this tweet of yours

went viral, reading, quote,

"Why don't I need feminism?

I have ARâ€15 reasons."

What were you trying to say?

â€ Well, Lawrence, there are

a lot of coastal elites

who want to make it illegal
to love America,

but real Americans know
defending liberty

is the most proâ€woman thing
of all.

â€ You know, no offense, Brambi,

but, honestly, it seems like
every conservative pundit

on TV reads from the same,
like, tenâ€phrase glossary.

â€ Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you triggered?

Because the only
trigger warning I need

is "the safety is off."

â€ Eh.

That was a good one.
â€ I know.

â€ You know, I think
this exchange

leads me to my next question.

Is social media

making us more divided?

â€ You know, Lawrence,
I think in many ways,

it brings us together,

and in many ways,

it does divide us.

Certainly, if you're only
getting your news

from Trump's
incoherent tweetsâ€â€

â€ President Trump lives
rentâ€free

in your head every day.

â€ Brambi, take me through
how you came up with that.

â€ Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you triggered?

Because the only
trigger warning I need

is "the safety is off."

â€ You said that already.

â€ [mockingly] "You said that
already."

â€ Okay, first off,
I do sound like that.

Secondly,

who are you?

Like, where do you come from?

Every other week,
there's some new

young conservative Barbie doll
who comes out of nowhereâ€â€

BRAMBI: Well, so much

for the tolerant leftâ€â€
build a wallâ€â€

lock her up!
Benghaziâ€â€nothing burgerâ€â€

Benghaziâ€â€Benghazi!
Coastal elite.

â€ Is she okay?

â€ You know, I don't know.

Iâ€I actually don't even know
where we got her.

She just showed up
wearing a lapel mic.

â€ Brambi?
â€ I'm a proud, gunâ€loving,

Godâ€fearing,
red state deplorable,

real American fromâ€â€

â€ Hey, can we check on Brambi?

â€ Fromâ€â€fromâ€â€

fromâ€â€fromâ€â€

SARAH: Where do you come from?

â€ Fromâ€â€fromâ€â€

fromâ€â€

From...

<i>[disquieting music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[inhales suddenly]

[breathing heavily]

â€ Your name is...

Brambi Streeter.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

â€ Your name is...

Sluzi Guggle.

<i>[disquieting synth music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

â€ What happens when I'm
not young anymore?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

â€ Be afraid.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

MAN: It is now time
for you to be armed

with your most dangerous
weapon.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[tweeting sounds]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

BRAMBI: Trump, Trump, Trump,

Trump, Trump,

Trump, Trump, Trump,

Trump, Trump.

MAN: What's happening?

â€ Brambi?
MAN: Somebody get help!

MAN: Get the medic!

â€ Stay with me, Brambi.

Stay with me.

Look...

we're gonna say
"Merry Christmas" again.

â€ No more "happy holidays"?

SARAH: Nope.

No more "happy holidays."

And no more genderâ€neutral
bathrooms, either.

â€ Two bathrooms.
Two genders.

â€ Yes.

Yes.

â€ What's happening?

I'm so scared.

â€ It's okay.
You don't have to be afraid.

Heaven is filled with
guys with guns.

â€ Good guys with guns?

â€ [laughs]

Great guys with guns.


â€ Mm.

Liberal tears.

â€ I know they're your favorite.

â€ Gah!

â€ Brambi?

â€ [sputtering, sparking]

â€ Oh, God.
Brambi?

â€ Well, looks like
we lost Brambi.

Our thanks
to Sarah Silverman,

Coming up after the break,

the new rightâ€wing
social media star

who's driving the left
up a wall.

Meet Sluzi Guggle.

â€ He is a veteran
of the George W. Bush

White House,
managed John McCain's

presidential campaign,
and this June,

he announced he was leaving
the Republican Party.

Please welcome a guy I have
admired my entire summer,

Steve Schmidt.

[cheers and applause]

So you left the Republican
Party this summer.

â€ I did.
SARAH: What took you so long?

â€ You know, the straw
that broke the camel's back

for me were the baby
internment camps.

We're grabbing kids
from the breasts of mothers,

putting them into
detention facilities.

It's as cruel a policy
as we've ever seen inflicted

by the government
of the United States,

and it represents for me
this moment of finality,

the corruption
of the conservative movement,

of the Republican Party
as it's fully become

the party of Trump.

â€ You said the party of Trump
has to be obliterated.

So how do we go about
doing that

that isn't a civil war
or an apocalypse?

â€ The way that it is repudiated
is through an election.

It needs to be burned
to the ground.

The analogy I've used
is a forest fire.

A forest fire destroys
the forest,

but in its destruction,
it purifies it,

and new growth comes
as a result.

It's part of the natural
life cycle.

So this needs to be
burned down.

The...


â€ Right, out of the ashes.

â€ And out of the ashes,
we hopefully see

a period of American renewal.

We need to have two functioning
parties in a twoâ€party system.

This moment that we have
with Trump,

I think there's a real lack
of imagination in the country

for the magnitude
of the tragedy

someone as incompetent,
as ignorant as he

is able to cause from the power
that comes with that office.

â€ There are people
who cannot imagine

that this could be true,
that a president can't lie,

and yet everything he says
is a lie.

He just has the cadence
of truth.

He sounds like he's shooting
from the hip

and telling it like it is,
but he's not, he's lying.

â€ He lies constantly,

he lied 3,000 times
in one year,

and his lies are different

than typical politician lies.

Most politician lies
are selfâ€interested ones.

It's about selfâ€preservation.

You know, we think
about the most famous lie

of the era, Bill Clinton,

"I didn't have sex
with that woman,"

it's a lie of selfâ€interest.

â€ I would say
weapons of mass destruction

is up there too.
No offense, my friend.

â€ I think mistakes and lies
are different things,

but the point with Trump
is this.

They're lies of authority.

Because it requires you
to submit to a proposition

that what is true is what
the leader believes is true.

So what we see is Donald Trump
going to mass rallies,

inciting the audience
with constant lying

and scapegoating vulnerable
minority populations.

Second thing he does
is he creates a sense

of victimization
and virtue in victimization.

He alleges conspiracies,
and then he asserts himself

as the protector, the avenger,

of the afflicted, the aggrieved
and victimized populations

to protect them
from the deep state conspiracy

and the hordes
of, say, Mexicans

running across the border.

It's dangerous, it's illiberal,

and it's profoundly
unâ€American,

and it's something
that needs to be repudiated

by the only people
who can repudiate it,

and that's the American people
in an election.

SARAH: Yeah.


Does he know he's doing it?

I just, I can'tâ€â€
I can't like, fathom

that he's that smart,
even in an evil way,

but there is something
he's got that isâ€â€

â€ He has anâ€â€
â€ He knows what he's doing.

â€ He has an instinct
for incitement.

And what happened
was this inciter,

this performer,
this reality show star,

found his way to this ideology,
and he feeds off the crowd,

he fuels the anger,
he fuels the resentment,

he picks up on it,
and he's made

a political movement out of it.

â€ It's not like
he's an evil genius.

It truly is a gift,
that was, likeâ€â€

that has been given by...
the devil.


You're still
a traditional conservative,

so how do you reconcile
that you are out there

pushing for a blue wave
these midterms?

â€ Well, look, Iâ€â€ I'm an American
before I'm a Republican.

I'm a smallâ€L liberal

in that I believe
in liberal democracy.

I believe in pluralism.

I believe in the dignity
of the human being.

One of the institutions
that the Democratic Party

may be able to salvage
when it stands up

against Trumpism, defeats it,
is the Republican Party itself.

Because the Republican Party
is an institution worth saving,

and it's an institution
that can only be saved

at this moment in time
by the Democratic Party,

who can defeat it and rebuke
Trumpism for all time.

â€ What is the price
of the Kavanaugh confirmation?

â€ It's a high price.

He may serve on that court
for 40 years.

He could serve on that court
till he's in his 90s.

He could be on the court
in 2058,

and what will always be true
is half the countryâ€â€

â€ Oh, my God,
I'll be in my 30s.

â€ You'll be in your 30s.

Half the country will always
view him as illegitimate.

They will always view it
as a corrupted process,

and so the net effect of this
is that the Supreme Court

has been degraded
through this process,

and I don't care where you
come down on this issue,

but if you look at it
through this prism,

Chuck Grassley has been there
for 38 years.

Diane Feinstein has been there
for 26,

which means those two
have worked together

in a body of 100 people
for 26 years.

They're both pushing
90 years old.

She's running for reelection.

And this is the outcome
of the work product?

This is the outcome we get?
Holy shit.

It's astoundingâ€â€
It's astounding to watch it.

And so the Senate looks like
a kangaroo court.

The judiciary committee
looks like

a kangaroo court on steroids.

The FBIâ€â€ the FBI played the patsy here
with the sham investigation

that it was ordered to conduct
by the White House,

and to, really,
a fundamental degree,

the only way that Kavanaugh

could have ever demonstrated
worthiness

for the seat for a lifetime
on the Supreme Court

was to withdraw
from the process,

but his ambition
was more important,

superseded the integrity
of the institution.

â€ Who can beat Trump in 2020?

â€ The next president
will always have

opposite virtues
of the last president.

Now, Democrats will make
a mistake if they get into

a dishonest contest
with Donald Trump,

because it's impossible to beat
him in a dishonesty contest.

â€ He's the best at it.

â€ And if you stand up,
and, you know,

with respect to Robert De Niro,

but if the message is,
"Fuck Trump,"

well, Trump wins
the vileness contest too.

And so what Democrats I think
need to understand

is that there's a difference
between toughness and meanness.

Meanness and cruelty
are different than toughness,

and the Democrats are gonna
need to have

a very tough candidate.

You're gonna see
a 20â€person field,

and it's gonna be
noâ€holdsâ€barred.

It's gonna be wide open.

And, you know,
through that process,

hopefully, you know,
comes forward someone

who can win a general election
and take him on.

â€ I hope you work
for one of them.

Thank you so much, Steve.

Steve Schmidt, everybody.
All right.

I'm gonna wrap up the show,
and then I'm gonna

turn back to you,
and let's do one of those,

like, '80s freezeâ€frames,
and then they'll run

the credits with, like,
royaltyâ€free music over it.

â€ Let's do it.
â€ Okay, ready?

All right, here we go.

My thanks to Steve Schmidt,

Milana Vayntrub,
and Lawrence O'Donnell.

Good night, America.
I lurve you.
