Can you play with me?

No.

Diane, play with her!

Talk to the hand.

Whatever!

Come on, Ruth, come
dance with me.

Come on, show me what you got!

â™ª Do the running man â™ª

â™ª Now stop! â™ª

â™ª Hammer time, uh-oh, uh-oh,
uh-oh â™ª

What are y'all in here doing?

You remember MC Hammer.

Oh my goodness!
Being annoying!

Any particular reason
why none of y'all

can keep that noise down while
I'm trying to get some sleep?

Honey, I'm sorry.

You want something to eat?

Well, what I want is
some peace and quiet!

Girls, please tell your
father sorry for making noise.

Uh, what?

That's supposed to make
it all better?

That's supposed to get me
through the graveyard shift,

some half-ass apology from
some ungrateful brats?

No, honey,
please don't talk like that.

What?

Bitch, you trying to tell me

how I can talk in my own house?

No.

Oh, oh, oh, so you
calling me a liar?

No, no, I just, no, uh-uh.

And what you caught
yourself doing?

You not gonna hit her again!

Bitch, you gonna stop me?

If I have to!

Baby, baby, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

Just me and your father,
we're just gonna,

we're just gonna talk, okay?

It's gonna be all right.

Just gonna, just gonna...

Don't you disrespect
me in front of them kids.

Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

Now go in there and
get them clothes off.

But baby, I don't
wanna do that...

Go in and get them clothes off

before I take 'em off you.

Okay!

No, no, no, no, what
are you doing?

Stop.

Stop.

Fuck.

Hey you, good morning.

No, no, no, no,
no, I only get down like that

when it's 2:00 a.m.
and I'm high,

and it's morning and I'm sober.

Come on, we can pretend
like it's 2:00 a.m.

Like I said, 2:00 a.m.
and high.

It's morning and you really
shouldn't even be here.

Really?
Yeah, I need you to go.

Come on.

Chop chop, get your shoes.

I guess that
goes for me too, huh?

That especially
applies to your ass.

I need you up and dressed

and I need both of y'all out.

Come on.

Shoes, come on, chop, chop.

Chop, chop!

Any day now.

So, um,

so what's up, can I get
your phone number?

Why would I do that?

You were never here and
we never met.

Really?

I been calling you all night.

Why haven't you picked
up the phone?

I didn't pick up because I
went to the club last night,

I picked up two strangers,

I snorted everything
that I possibly could,

and then engaged in a
filthy one night stand.

Really?

I'm kidding, okay?

I was here.

I was praying and meditating.

I needed some time to reflect.

Yeah, but why would
you even joke like that?

You know how my
sense of humor is.

But of all times,
like, really?

Yes, it's my mother's
funeral and I'm cracking jokes!

Fuck, sue me.

Can we go now?

I'm waiting on you, as always.

Carl, we're gonna be late!

And?

Diane, don't look at
me like that!

Don't make me keep it
real with you.

You know your mama
didn't like me.

So what you saying?

I think it's pretty
clear what I'm saying.

Your mama didn't like me, so
if I'm late to the funeral,

it's not that big of a deal.

What about me?

So, let's say you
show up on time,

is she suddenly gonna raise up
and everything gonna be cool?

How could you say
something like that?

How could you even
fix your mouth

to say something like that?

That is a very evil,
mean-spirited thing to say,

Carl.

When'd you
suddenly get so smart?

Man, get your stuff, come on,
let's go.

And I hope your crazy sisters
ain't acting crazy today.

I don't have the
strength for this today.

I really don't.

Mom, it'll be fine.

You said earlier we'll
just do this last part

and we'll be off.

Yeah, I know,

but we're trying to get the
house sold and mom dying,

and then my sister's
foolishness?

I just want this to be over.

Oh, don't worry, honey,

it's almost over.

Yeah, I don't even wanna go.

But I know this will be
the last time

I may very well step
foot in this old house.

Well then, let's not go.

Let's get ice cream instead.

Ooh, ice cream.

Yes, I'm down for that.

I can't do that.

I gotta be there.

I'm the oldest so I
gotta represent.

Well, whatever we do,

we need to make a decision soon

because I gotta use
the bathroom!

Ooh, mama gotta tinkle!

Look, I made you smile.

We got this, you gonna be good.

Yeah.

I went to the funeral

and I'm coming to your
people's house.

I hope they know how to cook.

That was a really
nice service.

You really have some
nerve showing up here

at my mother's funeral.

Look, I don't know what
you think is going on,

but I came to support Carl.

Well, you can "support
Carl" some other time.

You hoes today have no
decency or self-respect.

I'm not gonna beat you
and any of your little hoes,

and I'm not gonna go
back and forth with you.

Where's Carl?

Wait right here.

Oh, you stay out of this.

Let them handle it.

Your whore is here.

You invited her here like
I'm stupid.

I'm here to support you
and she here to support me.

Chill out, bruh.

She not family, why
is she here?

Damn, let's keep
your voice down...

No, this is my mother's house,

are we clear?
You know what, Carl, Carl?

Crazy ass sister.
What is going on here?

It's your sister.

She assuming and she reacting.

Nah, nigga, that's you.

Because you done came way
too comfortable

with disrespecting my
sister, and you know what?

I'm tired of that shit.

Hey, I know your mama died

but you need to get up
out of my face.

Whoa, this is my relationship.

I don't need you injecting.

I can handle my own business.

Hey, all right.

But I'll tell you what,

if Carl don't get Miss Little
Chicky-Poo up outta here,

I'm about to be all up in it.

See, I ain't got
time for this.

Let's all go on back, I'm out.

No, wait, just come
back, just come back.

Up off of me.

Come on, let's go.

You see what you did?

You pissed him off and
now he's gone!

Bitch, where is your spine?

Get off of me.

'Cause your
ass need to grow one.

Come on, come on, let's go.

Don't worry about her.
Dumbass.

And that dumb ass
Carl, I can't with him.

Yeah.
Lovely woman, lovely woman.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, lovely, lovely woman.

Thank you.

I'm so glad you flew out here.

My sister started that shit.

We're just gonna take
them the cake

and that'll be it, hear me?

I don't know what I'm
gonna do, man.

You got your hands full.

Hey, Anita, glad you came.

Hey, Neil, it's good to see you.

Hey, unc, I brought a cake.

Should I put it back there?

Yeah, right
there in the kitchen.

What?

What're you talking about?

What are you still doing
with that Carl?

I mean, come on, it's
been since high school.

Don't judge me, please,
not today.

Please don't.
Okay.

Hey, Niecy!

Oh, dang, she didn't even
look your way.

Who?

Oh, why do y'all always
gotta act like that?

This is our family.
Girl, I'm not worried

about her, I'm just
here for my mama.

I know, but you know.

Hey, handsome, how you doing?

Good, how are you?

Nice to meet you.
Good to see you.

Nice to meet you.

It seems like they can't
get together for nothing, man.

I know you not
just gonna walk past us

and not acknowledge us all day.

See what I mean?

Well, that was the plan.

Really?

You really need to get
over yourself right now.

Hey, Niece.

You seem to have a
problem over there.

You good?

No, I don't like how
you're talking

to my mother, so.

Oh, so it is a problem.

What's up?

Hold up, hold up, ladies,

hold up, hold up, please.

Listen, you not gonna
talk to her like that.

What did I do?

All I did was walk into
the house and...

Go outside, Niece.

You need to sit
down somewhere.

Hey, hey, come on,

Come on, come on.
Niece,

don't worry about it.

Don't worry, just have a seat.

I got this.
Uncle Will, for real?

Just have a seat, all right?

Really, like wow.

What's really going on?

I don't understand.

What did I do?

We have to find some
way to be nice.

All I did was walk
in the house!

I know, I'm not trying
to get involved.

Oh my God!

It's so irritating.

You okay though?

I'm good but like,

why is everybody
starting with me?

I don't know.

Like, really?

What?

I mean, what's
wrong, like, can you relax?

Try and be a little more
open with me now.

No.

I really don't understand

what's going on here, all right?

I know this is family
matters but...

I'm just, I'm ready to
go, honestly, already.

I mean, we can if you want to.

I'm leaving, I'm not
staying here.

Come on, girl.

Let's go get your baby.

Hey, Niece.

Hey, Giselle.

I'm getting ready to go.

All right, Niece.

I'll see you later, all right?

Listen, I want y'all to
call me later, all right?

All right.

Come by the house, we can
take care of this, all right?

I will.

All right, take care.

Come on.

All right, come on.

Ooh, you know what?

We can get your ice cream now!

Gotta get your mind off that,
okay?

Can we talk?

Well, seeing how you
just sat down there,

it looks like we about to,
so what's up?

Why?

Why do you continue to
disrespect me?

What on earth are you
blabbering about?

About everything.

The way you talk to me,

the other women?

Diane, you starting to
sound like the same old song.

Oh, for Jesus Christ, Carl!

For once in our
relationship, just be honest.

If I've ever meant
anything to you, ever,

just give me one honest moment.

Okay, okay.

You want some honesty?

Yes!

Go ahead, ask me
whatever you want.

Just remember you
wanted this honesty.

Okay.

Well, when I see you
with Janita?

Man, she's just a friend.

Stop playing games, Carl.

You said you'd be honest!

Okay.

Well, when you talk to her,
it's always with respect,

but you've never treated
me with anything like that.

Hurry up and get to
where you going with this.

What is that you see in her

that you don't see in me?

Well, one, there's the fact
that she'd never play herself

to even ask me something
silly like that.

But I love you, Carl.

I love you too, Diane,
but I'm about to do me.

You can either accept
it or not, it's on you.

And remember, you
wanted this honesty.

But what can I do to
make you love me more?

Well, first, Diane, just plop
yourself down here in front

of the TV and try harder
and I'll let you know.

Hey.

Yeah, man.

I'm gonna slide through there.

She's just getting them
on my nerves.

A'ight.

Hey, don't wait up, man.

I'm about to go shoot some pool.

Well, why bother with the lie?

We both know where you're going.

Habit, I guess.

Just be ready to uh,

perform for daddy when I
get back, a'ight?

Ain't you gonna get enough
performance over there?

Hey, don't worry about what
I'm gonna get up over there.

You just worry about
handling your business.

You gonna be ready?

I can't hear you.

All right, then, I'm out.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I'll do whatever you want.

Just come back, okay?

Don't I always?

Do you think there could be

some important correlation
with your relationships

with your, your sisters and
your mother and father that, uh,

that's preventing you from
having a successful relationship

now with your husband?

At first I didn't
think so, but you know,

looking back in it, uh, yeah.

I used to, uh,

well, me and, you know,
my sisters, uh,

would sit there and just
watch my dad smack my mom

and she would just be helpless.

She, she wouldn't do anything.

She wouldn't fight back.

When you've been with
someone since high school

and you know, they're your
best friend, you know,

and as you go down the line,
you know, people change,

and you know, things happen,
you know?

I loved him and, you know,
at the time he, you know,

he loved me.

I believe it, but you know,

after time passes, you
know, you get the subtlety

and you know, the mental abuse,

and then it just becomes
blatant disrespect.

And I have done everything
that I've can to appeal to him,

to please him,

but it just, it won't stop.

The disrespect just,
just won't stop,

and that's all I want.

I just want it to stop

'cause at this point
I'm just tired.

Look, I wanted to go
to a nice gym

where there is air conditioning
and everything else, okay?

Anyway, what you got
planned this weekend?

I gotta go
link up with uncle William.

Oh, uncle Will?

I love him.

Uh, what y'all got going on?

Well, you know, he cleaning
out my mom's old house.

Oh.

So he says she got something
that she left for me.

Okay, some
keepsakes and stuff?

That's nice.

Well, I wouldn't necessarily
say it's a keepsake.

It's a leather coat.

A old leather coat, really?

After everything you
done been through,

all you get is a coat?

Come on now.

It's, it's not just a
leather coat.

It was, it was special.

Okay, I get that.

Hell, it may have been

one of the only good things
my dad ever gave her.

And she would put it on
and you know,

she would instantly like,

get out of this depressed
mood that she was having.

Ooh, you just gave me chills.

I remember all that.

Yeah.

And you know my mom
didn't smile much,

but, when she, when she did,

it meant something.

So I gotta make sure I go
get it and take care of it.

I understand.

Well, I just want to
let you know you've been

so strong through all this.

I know I couldn't,

I could not do everything
you've been through.

You've just been so strong
and I'm so proud of you.

Aw, I appreciate that, Sara.

I do.
Yeah, well, you know,

you need anything, I got you.

Okay.

Well, right now I
need a burrito,

so that's where we need to go.

Burritos and cocktails!

Right, you ready?

Yes!

Hey, girl.

Yeah, thank you so much
for being there

and helping me with
mom's funeral.

I really appreciate it.

No, I haven't heard from
neither one of my sisters.

No, I'm not okay with it.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

I've been doing that.

I've been reaching out.

I've always taken initiative,

and when I do it always seems
like they just reject it.

I'm tired of that.

Still weeping for
your sisters?

Sara, I'm gonna call you back.

Why would you say
something like that?

Because every time
I look around

you're either talking about them

or you look like
you're gonna cry.

They are my sisters.

Well, I don't know
why you're acting

like they're so important.

If they're tripping,
forget about them.

I can't
just forget about them.

You can't do that with family.

It's easier said than done.

Sometimes I wish you
loved me how you love them,

or Ruth at least.

That girl could literally
spit in your face

and you'd still do
something to help that girl.

That's not true.

Anything.

I wish that were true,

but Ruth has always been
first with you

and she doesn't even
care about you.

Hey, uncle William.

Hey, niece, how you doing?

Mhm.
How you doing, baby?

I'm good, you?

You look good.

I bet you say
that to all the girls.

Nah, but
with you I really mean it.

So how's it going?

I'm all right.

I wasn't feeling what happened
at that repass though.

Yeah, well, you know,

wasn't none of us feeling that

with your sister
chasing after dude

and y'all arguing.

I mean, we gonna have to
really talk about this.

Mhm.

Because what y'all
are going through

it's gonna have to really
stop, baby, seriously.

Hey, uncle.

Hey, what's up, niece?
How are you?

I'm good, it's good to
see you, girl.

Good to see you.
Go on, have a seat.

Well, look what the
cat drug in.

Hello, Diane.

I wasn't expecting to
see you here.

And why not?

When my uncle asks me to
be somewhere, I'm there.

Well, I wish you
would've had that mindset

when mama was still living.

Why would I have to?

She had her precious
little Giselle.

Come on, y'all, come on.

Are these two chicks
arguing again?

What's up, Niecy?

Hey.

It's good to see you, baby.

So, uncle, if this is
what this is gonna be,

can you just give me the
coat that my mom left me

so I can go?

About that jacket...

Hold on, uncle!
Coat, what?

You said my mother left
a coat for me.

Nah, nah, no.

You said the coat was for me.

Oh, Jesus.

Now, I done came over here
all the way from where I came

from because you said
that coat was for me.

Wait a minute, hold up.

Hold up, calm down.

Hey, listen, calm down!
I'm the oldest!

I don't care!

Take your old ass...
Calm down, wait a minute!

Wait a minute, please!

I'm trying to tell
you something.

Old ass, bitch.
Y'all stop it.

Stop it right now!

Girl, that table!

I wish you would.
Y'all calm down!

I wish you would!
Don't make me come

across that table, Ruth!
I wish you would.

I wish you would.
Look.

Diane.
Man.

I wish you would.
Listen.

When your mother found out
she was finna die, man,

she made me make a
promise to get y'all here

so we can hash out all
our differences.

Uncle, I don't have
no differences.

These are my sisters
and I love 'em,

but I don't like they asses.

I don't like they little
funny ass ways.

I don't like things
about you either.

Shut up.

I got differences,
plenty of them.

I don't have any
differences at all.

I do my own thing.

Always have.

Ruth, man, I got a question.
Well, good for you!

Hold on, I got a
question for you.

You say you ain't got no
differences with your sisters.

Nope.

But lately you've been seeming
like the most hostile one.

What?

Okay, I guess because
I'm the youngest

these two smothered me
my whole life.

Smother?

I just, I'm grown now

and I just want my
space from them.

Smothering you?

Chick, I ain't
pay one minute of attention

to you since they brought
you home from the hospital.

And that's about
how much attention I paid you.

Giselle is the one I'm
talking about.

What?

What are you talking about?

Wow.

Ever since we were little,

you always been all over
me trying to control me.

She was so jealous of
me when we were little,

anytime I would try to
sit next to mama

she'll wedge herself right
in the middle.

I couldn't even have a
relationship with our mother

because she was always nearby.

Butting in and trying to
influence her.

And mama fell for that shit.

Like any decision that she
wanted to make,

she will call Giselle in
order to make it.

I just, honestly, I
can't wait to live a life

where there's no Giselle in it.

Okay.

Okay.

Why you gotta talk like that?

What, I'm being honest?

That's what I'm saying.

Y'all are fighting over
here like cats

and dogs all the time.
Oh my God.

God.

Shouldn't even be here.

Giselle, wait.

Get back over here and sit down

so we can finish this, please.

Does anybody else wanna tell
me how I've ruined they life

or how they don't want me in it?

Well, like I said,
I've got issues,

self-esteem issues,

because I didn't have the
love and support I needed

from my sisters.

Are you about to blame
your shitty life

and shitty choices on us?
Ruth!

What?

Go ahead, Diane.

Well, this one has
been distant towards me

since we were teenagers

and this one, just differences.

It's like we're not
even sisters.

I never had the love and
support that I needed from them.

You know what?

Who were you there to support?

Who were you ever there for?

Certainly not me.

You was in the streets, honey,

being this little
weak ass lab doll

behind some little
nigga named Carl.

As a matter of fact,
where Carl at?

Who was I ever there for?
Mhm.

I never had the chance
to be there for anyone.

My life has been ruined
since we were teenagers

because I told someone my
deepest secret

and they avoided me.

Shame to me.

So, no,

I didn't have any strength
to be there for anyone else.

What the hell is this
chick vibing?

I was raped.
Oh, no!

I was raped at 14 and
I told my big sister

and she tried to beat me up.
Jesus.

Tried to fight me.

Then she avoided me

because I guess she
didn't wanna see me.

Yeah.

I tried to fight you

'cause I was mad as hell!

You didn't listen!

I told you do not go down
to that studio

because all they do is take
advantage of young girls!

And what did you do?

You took your little stupid
ass down there anyway!

Even though I told you!

Nobody was avoiding you!

I was working.

So you wouldn't
have to see me.

Oh my God, girl,
are you stupid

or are you blind?

Shit, you probably both!

I was working so that I
could save money

to buy a weapon.

A weapon?

There wasn't no school
clothes for me.

There wasn't no summertime off.

Every got-damn dime that I saved

went into me buying a gun!

What?
Gun?

What's going on, I heard
you was looking for me?

Yeah.

I heard you the one to
see about a gun.

No arms sales down to kids.

Well, I ain't no kid.

I'm 17.

You got the money?

Yeah, I got about a G.

That's about the right price.

Let's do some work with
me right here.

How do I use it?

So let's just say I did
whatever I needed to do

to get done what needed
to be handled.

You remember how the news
said homie died

from some like, gang
beef gone bad

or some drug deal shit?

Yeah.

Well, it wasn't none of that.

It was me.

Oh, God.

Mama knew.

But we just never
talked about it.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

That was wow.

That was, gotta admit,

that was beautiful.

Oh my God.

You know what?

Take the coat,

split it in two,

and enjoy your new
sisterly love.

I am so glad that worked
out for the two of you.

No, Ruth, no.

No, no, Ruth.
Wow, that was amazing.

No, don't, please.

Please don't go.

We can't re-heal from this.

Now, will you just sit?

Unlike you,

nobody killed anyone for me.

And to be honest,

I never really had a
relationship with our mother

like the two of you.

I guess because I came
so much later.

I didn't even get to have
a bond with her.

All I had was a big
sister to babysit me all day,

every day and a creep of a dad.

Creep of a dad?

What the hell is she
talking about?

Oh, he skipped you guys' room.

Before our dad died,

he used to come into my
room every night

to tuck me in.

Or wait,

should I say tuck himself
into my bed every night?

And mama knew what was going on.

Her weak ass knew and she
didn't do shit to protect me.

Watch what you say
about my mother.

Yeah, yeah, your mother.

She wasn't a mother to me.

That's because she
wasn't your mother.

Giselle!

What are you talking about?

Uncle William?

It's time she knows.

What is she talking about?

Uncle William?

She, she,

she wasn't your mother!

Why would you even say
something like that, Giselle?

I wasn't just babysitting you

for all those years.

I wasn't just keeping
you close to me

because I just wanted to
be this perfect big sister.

Could've fooled me.

I'm your mother, Ruth.

Why would you even
say something like that?

I was 13 when I got
pregnant with you.

So the answer is no,

he did not skip my room!

You're lying.

You're lying!

She's lying right now.

Listen, mama sent
me down south.

She sent me down south

and when I had you
and I came back,

she made sure that I knew

that you, you were not
gonna be my daughter!

You were gonna be my sister,

but I was to protect
you at all costs.

So when I heard that he
was creeping in your room,

I had to do what I had to do.

I had to protect you.

What are you talking about?

Giselle?

Daddy didn't die of a
heart attack.

Giselle.

Oh, God.
What?

I poisoned him.

Jesus.

I poisoned him to protect you.

Ruth?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry you had to find
out like this.

All of these years

I didn't even know who
my real mom was.

And out of all the time,
you decide to tell me today?

I was a baby!

I didn't know what to do!

And I, I didn't know
what to say!

And mom, well, she was,

she was just so clear on
what needed to be done,

so I just...
Clear?

It would've been clear to
know who my mother was.

But I was there.

I was, I was there!

You, you might not have
known who I biologically was,

but I was there!

I don't even like,

know what to say to you
at this point.

I don't even know how to talk
to you besides as a sister.

Wait, what do we even do?

Can I at least have a,

can I at least have a hug?

I, I'm sorry.
No, no, don't.

Seriously, don't even touch me
right now, please, just move.

Oh, God.

Hello?

Hey, Brian, how are you?

Yeah, I'm just at home chilling.

Yes, I am alone.

Wow, you are so insecure.

That is a huge turn off.

Well, you should
learn to trust me by now.

I would never do anything to
jeopardize our relationship.

Okay, well, can I get
back to chilling then?

All right, I'll talk
to you later.

Yeah.

Well, thank you for taking me
to my first therapy session.

I know,

I know you don't know this,

but Ruth is my daughter.

She's your what?

She's my daughter.

Oh my goodness, oh.

And this, I don't,

girl, what are you talking
about, Ruth is your daughter?

There's just some
things that we don't,

we don't talk about
in my family.

Oh.

I'm your best friend.

You can't come and tell me?

I've been knowing you
for 15 years.

I see you every day,
five days a week,

and you couldn't tell me that?

Oh my God, this is,
this is crazy.

I, I, I am just.

I'm sorry.
Oh my God.

I couldn't tell you.

It's, it's just, it's,

it's been a lot going on,
you know?

Losing my mom,

having this, this big secret
come out after all this time,

it's, it's a lot.

Hi, Giselle, how are
you doing today?

Good, it's really good to
see you again.

Well, why don't you fill me in

on the update about you
and your sisters;

how are you guys getting along,

and your daughter, of course?

Well, the relationship
with my daughter is

it's going well.

I think we had a chance to, uh,
you know,

really clear the air
on some things,

and, uh, I just
wanted her to know

that regardless of the
decisions that I made,

that I, you know, I didn't
necessarily come forward with

and tell the truth right away,

that, that I always loved her.

That's okay.

Um...

As far as Diane is concerned,
we're, we're getting there.

Okay.

It's gonna take some time.

Is there anything

that you feel like you
could do to help that,

that time progress?

Um...

I guess I would say patience,

for me to have some patience
for them to come around,

um...

and also maybe forgive myself.

So you mean to tell
me, like, you were, well,

molested coming up?

That and my sister is
actually my mom.

Wait, what?

Yeah, Giselle told me
that she was raped

and my,

she's my mom.

She's your mom?

You just got this news, like,
recently or?

Last week when uncle Will
brought us over to talk

and hash it out and...

That's pretty, that's
pretty crazy right there.

Tell me about it.

I hope this doesn't
get in the way

of you guys coming
together as a family

and just trying to reconnect.

Coming together as a family?

I don't even know
what family is at this point.

I don't even know who
my family is.

But I mean, it's no
time for you to give up.

I mean, it's, this
is a good time

for you guys to come
back together.

Now at this point,

I don't even know how to feel.

I, I don't have a relationship
like that with any of them.

Diane's not actually my sister

and I don't even know what
she is to me at this point.

I mean, it's a good
time to figure it out.

I mean, you gotta
start somewhere.

No, no, we did that last week.

I'm just, I don't know,

I'm just, not, not,
not gonna talk to them.

I don't have to.

Look, well, it's a step
in the right direction.

I know.

I mean, it didn't go as planned.

Forget the right direction!

I pretty much grew up
with no mother!

Well, technically, I didn't
even know who she was.

What am I supposed to do
at this point?

Start all over?

You know,

my sisters, they,

my mom and my,

they wanna go to therapy

and work everything out.

That's good, that's
a good thing!

So, I guess in order to
get our family

back on the right track,

I guess I can go to this
one therapy session.

It's gotta start somewhere.

One is better than none,
trust me.

And I support you.

I can sit in the parking lot
and wait on you to come out.

I love you.
I love you.

So, hi, Ruth,
how are you doing today?

I'm good.

It's good to see you.

It's good to see you too,
yeah.

Yes, so fill me in,
let me know, uh,

why don't you tell me a
little bit more

about your, your personal life;

how's that going?

My personal life's
been going good.

Yeah, I'm still with
my boyfriend.

Good, okay.

We've, we've gotten better.

Better?
Yeah.

Is there,
uh, anything in particular

that you'd like to
discuss about then?

Um...

During the,

during the thing with my
grandmother passing away,

I kind of released my
stress in ways

that other people probably
wouldn't agree with.

Such as?

Um, after night
club rendezvous?

Okay.

Uh, does your boyfriend
know about this?

No.

What do you
think he would do if he knew?

Probably leave.

And
how does that make you feel?

Hurt.

So why is it that, uh,

why, why do you do these things?

I didn't anyone to talk
to when I was growing up.

You know?
Mhm.

I didn't have a mother
that I can run to.

I didn't have a sister
that I can confide in.

There, that was,

that was the only thing
that I could do

in order to forget what I was
going through for the moment.

Okay, okay.

Well, I wanna say that
these individual sessions

are very beneficial.

However, it will be
very beneficial for you

and for your sisters if
you guys continue

to come in together.

So I'd, I'd like to set up a,
a time where we can get you

all three in here together.

Uh, do you think
that's something

that you'd be open to doing?

Yeah.

Yeah?

Okay, good.

All right, well, um,

let's put that together and, uh,

we'll be in touch.

Okay.

All right?
All right.

Have a good day, okay?

You too.
Thank you!

I'm so glad the
work day is over.

You and me both.
God.

Hello, Ruth.

What the hell are
you doing here?

Who is this?

What you
mean what I'm doing here?

You haven't responded to
any of my texts,

none of my phone calls,

and you deleted me off
all your social medias.

What you think I'm doing here?

You don't understand what
our arrangement was, do you?

And you're beautiful.

What you mean, what arrangement?

It was a one-time thing!

Of course I'm not gonna
call you and text you back.

How did you find out
where I work at?

What are you doing here?

A one-time thing?

Ruth, how could you do
me like that?

I love you.

You need to leave!
Hey, you need to go!

Seriously.

Goodbye.

I'll see you later.

I don't even...

How'd he even find out
where I work?

Ruth, I know you got a
man and that wasn't him.

What is going on?

Seriously, it was
just a one-night stand.

I didn't expect him to
pop up at my job.

Like, who does stuff like that?

That was crazy.

That was intense.

If this guy doesn't go away...

Oh, he's gotta go away.

Definitely.

So what made you do it?

There's just so much
going on in my personal life

with my family.

I just,

I just needed to get
away from it all,

just like, escape
reality for one day,

and I didn't, I didn't expect it

to turn into anything like that.

So what's going on,
you wanna talk about it?

I just
found out that my sister

is actually my mom.

And my other sister is
actually my aunt

and my grandma is not my
grandma either.

It's just a lot.

It's a lot to process

and I'm just,

I don't even know how to handle
everything at this moment.

I really don't.

That is a lot to handle.

Tell me about it.

But I don't
wanna mess anything up

on my boyfriend.

I don't wanna hurt him,
he's a really good guy.

I just hope whatever
happened today

just doesn't spiral
out of control.

I hope not.

Have you thought about
seeing anybody?

Yeah, my sisters are talking

about seeing a therapist or
something, but I don't know.

That therapy shit, it
rarely works.

Well, you can talk to me.

Honestly, I'm just ready
for all of this to be over.

Hey, honey, what's up?

Yeah, what time?

Okay, well, I just have
one more set of clients,

the Williams sisters,

and then I can meet you there.

Okay.

All right, see you soon, bye.

Okay.

All right.

Hi, ladies, I'm Dr. Roberts.

Thank you for coming in today.

Would anyone like to discuss
what brought you here today?

Um...

Well, I guess, um,

for me, um, I would like to
build better relationships

with my sister and, um,
my daughter,

but I feel like I'm blamed for
a lot of the things that have

transpired in our family,

and, um, I don't
think that's fair.

Okay.
I wanna be forgiven.

What do you mean?
Be serious.

Are you kidding me?

Come on now.

Like, you just
dropped a bomb on us

a couple weeks ago.

Okay, but it wasn't
just my bomb.

I didn't create the bomb.

Well, she led into it.

She might as well say it.

You know what, Diane?

If your attitude is not
gonna be positive,

then maybe you
should think twice

about being here.
Are you gonna tell her

the story or what?

Anyway, so our mother

made a decision when
I was younger

when I got pregnant...

To hide me and to pretend...

It wasn't to hide you
or to pretend anything.

She made a decision that
she felt was, was best.

She made a decision that she
felt would protect us all.

And I'm not saying that I
agree with it,

but I don't think I should
be blamed for it either.

I don't, I don't blame
you for anything.

It's just, this is just
a hell of a confession.

It's no wonder why me and her,

we don't mix.

It's like oil and water

'cause she's my niece.

Anyway, um...

I was 13 when I got
pregnant with her

and I didn't know how to
deal with that.

I didn't know what to do.

So when mom decided to
send me away to have her,

I trusted that she,

she was doing what she
felt was best.

Had I known that it would
cause such a, a, a rift

and bring us here to
this place today,

then maybe, I don't know,

maybe things could have
been different.

But I always felt like Diane
has had this unnecessary

animosity against me.
Don't even play me, girl.

For something that I didn't
have any control over.

You know damn well why
I felt the way I felt.

And I told you that when we
were at uncle William's house.

You know why, you know why.

The one person that I trusted

to tell something that
happened to me

just basically just disowned me.

And then that's what
I felt like.

Okay.

Okay, but now you know I
did not, I did not disown you.

I know that now.

Yeah, but you were stupid
enough to go down to the studio

after she told you not to do it.

I'm not even talking to you

and I'm still not
talking to you.

This has nothing to do with you.

Okay, this is exactly why

I didn't want to come
here in the first place.

I'm talking to her.
Then you could

have stayed home.

Okay, okay, okay, let's,
ladies.

Nobody forced you here.

Let's, let's bring
it back to us,

the understanding of the
friction in your relationship,

in this family.

So how did you feel having to
go with your mother's decision

of saying that that was
Ruth was your sister,

instead of saying the
truth, I guess, you know?

I remember feeling empty.

I remember feeling powerless,
like,

but at the same time I
remember feeling

cared for, if that
makes any sense?

It's confusing.

Okay.

Uh, Ruth, did you have
anything you might want

to add about?

How did you feel about
the situation?

Confused.

Angry.

Um, I don't know.

I just, I'm still
wrapping my head

around everything that happened.

It's not something that a
blink of an eye

you can just be like, "Oh,
okay, this is my mother.

"I have a relationship with her.

"And this is my aunt."
Of course.

"We're gonna get along fine."

We still don't.

Of course.

Well, it's only natural.

I mean, of course it
would take time

for you guys to have to
build a, a relationship.

You know, this is all
new information,

except for, for you, of course.

So.

Well, I wanna know, like,

now that the truth is out,

now that you know why,

why are you still angry?

I'm not angry.

It's just, it's, it's
hard to process.

That's just not something
that when you,

when you find out the reasons
behind some of the actions

that were put forth,

it's just not something
overnight you could say,

"Oh, okay, this is
what happened.

"I'll go ahead and
adjust my life to that."

That's just not how it works.

This happened, what,
like a week ago?

That's just, all of the events
that transpired up to this,

it's just, it's,

it's just a lot to just
take in and just.

Okay, well, why don't
you tell me more

about the events
that transpired?

How my niece came about.

I mean, I know that our
household wasn't perfect.

We were dysfunctional as hell.

I mean, the things that
we had to see.

Oh, for God's sake, Diane,
just say it.

Our father was a fucking rapist.

Oh, okay, there you go.

There it is.

But like I said, that's not
anything that you just get over

and move on with your
life with it,

especially if you don't see
things like that happening

until somebody just takes
the pin out and just

throws the bomb and it
automatically entails

everything,

and then you expect everything
to be okay after that?

Well, how...

We supposed to be all
peanut butter and jelly

and holding hands and skipping
down the street after that?

Not peanut butter and jelly.
Be real.

I am being real.

How did you expect for
this shit to come out?

Did, did, did you expect
a bouquet of flowers?

Really, that's not cool.

You've been very
quiet for a while.

Why don't you tell me
how do you feel

knowing that your grandfather
was actually your dad?

I don't even wanna think or
talk about that man, honestly.

But I do know that
my grandmother

would hate for us to
be like this,

especially after
everything that's happened.

And I know that I haven't
always been

the one that is the most
talkative or easygoing,

and I've given both of
you, like, a lot of crap,

but uncle Will brought
us here together

and it was for my grandmother.

So if we're not gonna
fix it today,

sooner or later something
has to happen.

I just wanted to be forgiven.

I think, I think I
could definitely do that.

Good, we're making progress.

How about you, Giselle?

I, I love my, my sister,
I always have.

Didn't really have, like, a
close relationship with my mom

like her and my mom did,
you know?

So I always looked up to her,

I always went up to her,
always confided in her.

I just think that one hiccup,

it, it, it hurt me just
to, to get her reaction.

But now that I know why.

I love my sister to death,

I was just so damn angry at her

because for a while I didn't
know why she did what she did,

why she reacted towards
me the way she did.

So for a long time, I, I
internalized it

and I took it into my, my
relationship, you know?

And I love her to death
and I love her,

but that's not gonna change.

I was just hurt.

And I love my niece.

I mean, granted, our
relationship was non-existent.

We were passing in the house,
not even acknowledging,

and I will take the fall
for most of that

because it wasn't her
fault how she got here.

And I didn't know at the time,

but I always loved her.

I didn't show it.

I didn't show it.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry too.

I should've told you
about it sooner.

I mean, it wasn't
really your fault, Giselle.

But I know why you
did what you did,

and I thank you for that,

because for a long
time I thought it

was just swept under the rug.

The length that you would go

to protect your family

even though we didn't
see what was going on.

Thank you.

Thank you.

This is the first time
I've hugged my mother.

Ooh.
