    NARRATOR: Previously, on
   "Worst Cooks in America"...

   Let's go, boy!

 We want you to cook
for some special guests.

        -Oh, that's nice.
       -Livers feel funny.

   I've worked so hard on this
duck and, now, am I ruining it?!

I can't even believe
   they made this.

              It's<i> really</i> good.

              -Aye!
        -We've decided...

               No one's going
                 home today!

Oh, thank you, Jesus!

             Come back next week
              ready to rumble.

                     â™ªâ™ª

            NARRATOR:
      This year, 14 of the
     worst cooks in America

        have been drafted
      into the most intense

       culinary boot camp
         in the country.

                   Ohhhhh!

            Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

                   Oh, my God.

       Answering the call
     to lead these recruits

       is Anne Burrell...

Do what I did, or you're
gonna have a problem.

  ...and back for a rematch...

                   Burn it up!
      ...is Robert Irvine.

              What about this?
             Why didn't you...?

    Aaaah! Chef!
 I'm not ready yet!

         Their mission:
 turn these kitchen disasters...

  How about you use
   the sharp side?
         Oh!

    ...into kitchen masters.

               Oh, it worked!

 Life a professional
     chef-chef!

                    Aah!

     The final two will cook
    a restaurant-quality meal

  for a chance to win $25,000.

          It's Anne...
   Oh, yeah.

       ...versus Robert...
Never seen that before.

      ...as they take on...

             The stress and the
             pressure of it all!

 ...the worst cooks in America.

                     â™ªâ™ª

     Good morning, recruits.

                  Morning.

          Here we are,

       for the<i> final</i> time,
          in boot camp.

 We have been working for<i> weeks</i>
      to get to this point.

    Today, it will be decided

      who will represent us
         in the finale.

             TIMMY:
      I'm comin' prepared.

    [<i> Shing! Shing! Shing!</i> ]
  My knives are all sharpened.

            Let's go.

      That's right, so one
  elimination challenge to go.

  Only one person from the red
   team can go to the finale,

so I have to win this challenge.

         We want to see
        how you're going

          to apply<i> all</i>
     of the building blocks

 we have been working on for all
    these weeks in boot camp.

   [ Suspenseful music plays ]
 You have 45 minutes to recreate

        the baseline dish
       you did on week 1,

    using all your new skills
    that we have taught you.

      Oh, man.

     And your time starts...

              now.
              -Agh!

                     â™ªâ™ª

                   Whoops.

         Cayenne pepper.

                    Ugh!

    [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ]
     The sauce is the start

          of the dish,
  so I have to get this right.

      My baseline dish was
      an Alfredo ca'bonero

    made with ramen noodles.

              -Ugh!
     -Like somebody threw up

    in my mouth.

      Even I can't believe
          I made that.

   My heart attack in a bowl.

      Today, I'm gonna use
       fettuccine noodles

  because fettuccine ca'bonero

      should actually have
        fettuccine<i> in</i> it.

            Who knew?

                     â™ªâ™ª

             Where's your pasta,
              in the microwave?

    Uh, heh, no, we're gonna
        cook this pasta.

                 Wha-a-a-t?!
               You impress me.

              You look so nice
              today, doing it.

           Thank you.

       I dress to impress
       because I may want

           to wow Anne
    with my beautiful skirt.

                     â™ªâ™ª

  Oh, look at you.

  Janese, stop it.

           Whoo-whoo!
             Go, me.

                    Ooh!

     -How you doing, Timmy?
             -Good!

    Day 1, I was making these
     awful, burnt egg rolls

 and my dipping sauces were just
     hot, hot, and hot mess.

           All right.
             Oo-ooh!

   Today, I'm making egg-roll
         wonton frittes.

  It's like the fancy chef word

         for like mini,
       little, fried food.

         I'm making beef
     and a veggie egg roll.

    That way, they could have
     two different options.

        Awesome, awesome.

   This time, it's gonna come
   with three amazing sauces:

          fruity sauce,
    an Asian-inspired sauce,

 and a pepper-and-tomato sauce.

    You got tame Timmy today.

       -He makes me, like.
  -He makes me like that, too.

Looks like party Timmy.

   Both Timmys wanna jump out
       and party with me.

          [<i> Cheering</i> ]

           Whoo-oo-oo!

                  Oh, god.

    [ Whimsical tune plays ]

                Oh, good god.

                You're losing
                your apples.

  14 minutes, guys!

 It's not as red as I would like
  it to be, but, it looks good.

           So week 1,
   I made chicken enchiladas.

  I like boiled the chicken...

      Oh, that's not good.
        That's not good.

     ...and I used a premade
         taco seasoning.

         Now, I'm making
        my own seasoning.

               Oh, good Lord.

        Bradley's got the entire
          spice rack over there.

       This time, instead
     of boiling the chicken,

  I'm gonna actually grill it.

       Chicken looks good.

        And then I'm also
         gonna add like

  a Spanish twist on some rice.

          [ Sizzling ]
 I got my bell pepper in there.

Chef Rob is watching everything,
  but, every time he comes by,

        it just makes me
   a little bit more nervous.

Yes, I'm watching you.

    [ Sinister music plays ]

   Okay, um, I think I'm good
       with the heat here.

                     â™ªâ™ª

     I got my onions going.

  [ Suspenseful music climbs ]

          [ Suspenseful
         chord strikes ]

         I-I don't know.
        He's everywhere.

     Let's melt some butter
            in there.

 Back in the Baseline Challenge,

   I made some scrambled eggs
   with some sausage in there,

   covered in chocolate gravy.

         So, this time,
    I'm gonna show Chef Anne

    that I can make breakfast

       without stickin' it
         in the blender.

  I'm making a omelet with some
   bell peppers for some color

        and I'm gonna put
    some sausage on the side.

Are you gonna do a version
 of chocolate gravy?

  [ Suspenseful chord strikes ]

            I'm not.

   Oh, thank god.

    Even though I'm not gonna
      do it this go-around,

            I think,
    if I had to make it now,

       that she would love
        chocolate gravy.

     [scoff] Ew.

                     â™ªâ™ª

     Oh, my god!

        Who doesn't love
          garlic bread?

              Let's distribute
              you guys evenly.

           One minute!

       ROBERT:
   You got a towel
    alight there.

          Aah! [laughs]

      Let's go.
Finish it up nicely, huh?

              Nice.

            10, 9, 8,

            7, 6, 5,

        [ Robert joins ]
              4, 3,

               2, 1.
       -That's it. Hands up.

           You're done!

                     â™ªâ™ª

           All right.
           Here we go.

        This is it, guys.
          -I'm a mess.

             -Whoo!
      -Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

          Damn, Daddy.

                 All right.
           Let's do Timmy first.

          [ Clucking ]
  These egg-roll wonton frittes

      are lookin' amazing.

           Oh, my god.
  I'm embarrassed at my old me,

        but I'm so proud
          of my new me!

      Definitely looks like
       a party on a plate.

           What do we have here?

       Two different types
       of egg-roll frittes

 [ Whimsical-suspenseful tune ]
   and three types of sauces.

         I applaud that you made
              a vegetable one.

                 [ Crunch ]

               It tastes good.
             I like this sauce.

            That's got some nice
                 heat to it.

               The first time
                we had this,

         it was in raw potatoes.

             -Yeah.
    -Now, we've got peppers,

         so that's a good thing.

            I applaud you on the
           attempt at the pesto.

              Good.
        -Thank you, Chef.

  I'm like mini Chef Timmy now.

            -Bradley.
    -These chicken enchiladas

      are definitely better
   than week 1, like for sure.

            Okay, so talk to me.

     So, for you, I have my
   recreated chicken enchilada

        accompanied with
      a Spanish-style rice.

          It's got a great heat,
               in a good way.

                  I get it.
            I get the seasoning.

              The rice is<i> just</i>
                 on the edge

           of being undercooked,
                  however,

              it's a good plate
                  of food.

              Good.

                 Thank you.

Sarah, you're up first.

       I am proud to serve
      Chef Anne this dish,

   especially compared to that

              trash
       I made 7 weeks ago.

                     â™ªâ™ª

     Wowza! Huh?

            -I know.
     -This is like a really

 updated breakfast.

 You have beautiful
     knife cuts

      going on
   in your omelet,

you seasoned your eggs
   really nicely,

 and you've made it
   look beautiful.

        Nice job, Sarah.
           -Thank you.

     All right.
 Come on up, Janese.

    I recall Chef Anne sayin'

      my Baseline Challenge
       looked like vomit.

        There's no vomit
      on this plate today.

                     â™ªâ™ª

      Oh, wow!

              Yes.
  Oh, my gosh!

   This is a fettuccine pasta
      with a homemade sauce

     and a garlic crostini.

This is the prettiest
    plate of food

that you put together
     all season.

            -I agree.
  -And you've got peas in there

      that look
 beautifully green.

     Your pasta
is perfectly cooked.

  Your pasta water
probably could've had

 a pinch more salt,

  but this is such
a nice plate of food.

           Thank you.

     Welcome back, recruits.

    I can speak for my team,
   that I am incredibly proud

  of how they did in this final
     Skill Drill Challenge.

 And I'd like to say
   the same thing.

  But, as you know,
   only two of you

can move on to the finale,
which means, unfortunately,

two of you are going
   home right now.

      So, both of you girls
        <i> killed</i> it today.

      It really comes down
   to the tiniest of details.

    The recruit that will be
   continuing on in boot camp

       and representing me
       in the finale is...

  [ Suspenseful music climbs ]

             Sarah.

       Holy cow, I'm going
      to the finale, y'all.

           I made it.

 You really absorbed the lessons
  that we've had in boot camp.

Thank you very much.

       I'm sorry, Janese.

  That means I need your apron.

       I have loved to see
      how far you've come.

      I came to boot camp,
   thinking I was a good cook,

         but now I<i> know</i>
        I'm a good cook.

      A world-renowned chef
       cosigned it, okay?

      It's hard to be upset
      'cause I did so well.

            I've enjoyed so much
          having you on my team.

      My family is actually
     gonna eat my food now.

    [ Upbeat chord strikes ]

    Blue Team, I think you've
      both come a long way,

   but one person has it more
       than the other one,

         so the recruit
        on the Blue Team

  that will be representing me
       in the finale is...

   My heart is racing so hard

 that like I can feel the beats
        on my fingertips.

   I've put my heart and soul
           into this.

          I want this,
     for my mom, my family.

   It's not about me anymore.

  [ Suspenseful chord strikes ]

                     â™ªâ™ª

   [ Suspenseful music plays ]
 So the recruit on the Blue Team

  that will be representing me
       in the finale is...

                     â™ªâ™ª

            Bradley.

    [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ]
              Thank you, Chef.

           You're calm
      and you're collected

     and that's what I want
    representing me tomorrow.

        I'm sorry, Timmy.
    That means I'm gonna have

     to ask for your apron.

             TIMMY:
     I honestly feel really
        proud of myself.

      I'm definitely gonna
          keep cooking.

                   Let me
             tell you something.

                You have come
              such a long way.

              C'mere, you doof.

                     â™ªâ™ª

 I am not one of the worst cooks
       in America anymore!

        I've been cured!

         [ Outro plays ]

       So, Sarah, Bradley,
        congratulations.

       You are the winners
         of your teams.

     Princess Cactus Flower
      is going to crush it.

        You guys now have
       a 50-percent chance

  of walking away with $25,000.

 I am feeling pretty dang good.

        Chef Anne, Sarah,
      we're comin' for ya.

  Tomorrow will be the hardest
       day we've had, yet,

 but, before we get to tomorrow,
      let's plan our menu.

  Sarah, step into our office.

             Bradley, let's go.

          So, first thing, I was
       thinking that we would do

           a pea-and-goat-cheese
                  ravioli.

  Chef Anne knows that I don't
 like the taste of goat cheese.

          [<i> Bleating</i> ]
Your favorite,
 goat cheese.

             I know.
      I grew up with goats

   and it tastes like a goat.
           -[Bleating]

   So I was in the bottom two
         with the pasta,

 so she's really challenging me
     with this first course.

             Yeah, there ya go!
                 Krr! Yeah!

                 Aggressive,
                 aggressive.

                  Raagghh!

     Ravioli dough has to be
     kneaded out just right.

               Gimme a couple
                 of "Mnh!"s.

                  Come on.
               Let me feel it.

      Let me feel it. Yeah.
             -Okay.

  It takes<i> years</i> of experience

      for someone to master
         fresh ravioli.

   Squeeze, stop,
   and pull away.

      You have to make sure
        it's all sealed,

       so that the filling
       does not come out.

       We don't wan them to look
                like someone

                 took a bite
             out of 'em already.

             -Yeah.
     -That's okay for today,

but not for tomorrow, all right?
             -Okay.

 So, for course one,
   a piece of fish

 that's hard-seared,
    skin-side up.

     Rub it with
 za'atar seasoning.

              Okay.
  Chef Rob, I'm trying to like

   decipher what he's saying.

With a salad of frisÃ©e,

  English cucumber,
 done like American.

       It sounds like it's
      in another language.

   [ Piano plays jaunty tune ]

       [<i> Whistle! Whirl!</i> ]

             Mm-hmm.
   Yes?

  Yeah, that sounds good to me.

           [<i> Rattle!</i> ]
          I'm screwed.

 Fish, trim that up
  so it looks nice.

  No, you point in.

   Score the skin.

           Push it in.
            -Dang it.

     The skin is tough, man.
     [<i> Jackhammer whirring</i> ]

             No, you're ruining
                  the fish.

                You gotta be
                really quick.

          You're in, push, done.

   I'm gonna have to just like
     kinda stab it in there.

                 All right.

       Ch-chu, real quick.

        [ Siren wailing ]

             So, I'm gonna make
                 the salad.

     Red onions,
   nice and thin.

You don't want a mouthful
    of red onion.

 For me, a salad is just spinach
     right out of that bag.

                Grapes, nuts,
                pomegranates.

      This one, it has like
      so many other things.

                     â™ªâ™ª

        ANNE:
Get those in your sauce.

    Get your peas
      in there.

  Take some of this
beautifulness on top.

          Here you go.
           -Thank you.

      [ Upbeat tune plays ]

          -You like it?
    -I do not like the taste

   of goat cheese, whatsoever.

         But, turns out,
   it doesn't taste that bad.

          That is good.
     Not only have my skills

        come a long way,
      but so has my palate.

                That makes me
                 very happy.

          Load the fish right in
         the middle of the plate

               and take this.

                Not too much,
               just put it on.

         So eat, get everything:
                the dressing,

            the salad, the fish.

          Happy? Right?
    -Yeah. That's delicious.

       -You like a mashed
         potato, right?
          -I do, yeah.

             So for the entrÃ©e,
               we're actually

                 gonna make
            a mashed cauliflower

               and we'll have
              a pistachio pesto

            and we're gonna make
           herb-crusted halibut.

              Why? Just for the
           halibut. [hell of it]

               I got a million
                  of those.

        [<i> Crowd booing</i> ]

                Nice and hot.
                 Lay it in.

     We haven't learned fish
   in this competition, yet...

         Turn it over and lay it
                right there,

                 and give it
               a little press.

    ...and I've never cooked
         halibut before,

         so this is new
        territory for me.

      Careful!

Let's move on to the
   second course:

medallions of veal, a little
red-wine sauce, celeriac.

   You know what celeriac is?
           -I do not.

            Celeriac.

           Celery-yak.

            Seleryak.

        It's like celery

    and then -ack at the end.

          [ Laughing ]

   Turn it on the
   other side now.

     Other side.
   Come on, dude.

      Besides the perfectly
          cooked veal,

      [ Upbeat jazz plays ]
   I have a lot of things that

      are gonna have to go
        onto this plate.

              Then we're gonna
                make polenta.

        Uhh, sorry, what?

  What is that P thing called?

       What's the P thing?

         Polenta. Jesus.

           Cauliflower
       and celeriac purÃ©e.

                  Celeriac.

  It's just this brown-looking,
          tannish ball.

    It looked like cardboard.

  It's part of the
   celery family.

 Instead of stalks,
 it comes in a head.

              Okay.
    Then I'm also gonna have

          to have these
        sautÃ©ed veggies.

    I want this.

           [<i> Clang!</i> ]
               Oh.

      This is the most food
     I've ever had to make.

               Use your wrist.
                There you go.

Cauliflower in there.

       Back home, we like
      our mashed potatoes.

Cauliflower mash is a weird take
  on mashed potatoes, I guess.

    Swoosh-sh-sh!

     Like that.
Romanesco cauliflower.

    Take a fish.

               Pesto, falling
             off the other side.

             Have you ever made
      anything like that before?

         [laughing] No.

     [ Upbeat outro plays ]

   [ Suspenseful music plays ]

                     â™ªâ™ª

          That's good.

          [ Laughter ]

        Yes!

        So I start with celeriac
             and I just do this.

          Don't be afraid of it.

           Polenta, yep, drop it
          in there, beautifully.

                    Veal.

                  A little
               red-wine sauce.

         Time to taste.
    -That's my favorite part.

[ Strings plucking jaunty tune ]

   Veal is cooked perfectly...

         That's amazing!

        ...and Chef Rob's
           very happy.

             Sometimes I wonder
              why I'm so good.

          [ Chuckling ]

To finish everything up,
   because I know

    that you love a biscuit,
             -I do.

  we're gonna make
     a beautiful

     strawberry
and raspberry shortcake

             -Okay.
-and we're gonna zhuzh it all up

 with some ice cream
 and some microherbs

     and make it
 a fancy shortcake.

       I'm from the South
   and we know about biscuits,

       but I've never had
      a biscuit like this.

    Heavy cream,
   pour it around.

     Now, pulse,

          -Oh -- okay.
         -Pulse, pulse.

                 Okay, yeah.

          [ Laughter ]

  Okay, let's work
     on dessert.

   We're gonna do
  a Key-lime tart.

   Key lime pie is very tricky
because there's a very fine line

     between rock-hard crust
         and perfection.

Push it down, right.

Make sure it's even.
  If it's too thick

    in the base,
it'll be hard to cut.

                  Be quick,
             but make it right.

And we are going to get
  our strawberries

  soaked with sugar
   and lemon zest.

I think just the juice
   of one of those

    will be fine.

             Gol-ly!

         While we're doing that,

     can make whipped cream.

                    Stop.

   It's the name of the thing.

      You just whip cream.

     It's pretty crazy, heh.

And so we're gonna take
the bottom of the biscuit,

ice cream right on top
  of the biscuits.

like a lot of the syrup
      in there.

Top with whipped cream.

  white chocolate.

 meal X and meal Y,

so that you won't know
      which one

  of our finalists
  made which dish.

  -Nice really balance of acid,

     a little bit of spice.

     It's really well done.

There are elements of this
that I'm just loving:

the way that the fish
     is cooked,

the crispness of the skin,

along with the acidity
   and the citrus.

   -It is a big bite of onion.
  -It is. That was a big bite.

the goat cheese on here.

 a little sloppily plated here.

Visually, enh, but my nose
is ready to dive in.

        Mmm!
This is really good.

              The pasta itself
                is delicious,

          but the edges, there's
       a little crunch to there.

     Ugh, yes! And the sauce
         is<i> really</i> nice.

  But I do think they could've
  seasoned a little bit better.

       I get the sweetness
          of the peas.

     Definitely,
 a little bit sweet.

It needs some balance,
  without a doubt.

    Well, this is fantastic.

          I can't wait
      for the next course.

You and me both.
                   [ Laughing ]

All right. You guys ready
to go on course number 2?

    Let's hit it.
  Time starts now.

  This main dish is gonna have
    so many different things.

         Scoop them on.

       I'm starting to get
      all my veggies ready.

                  Unh-unh.

    Remember, it's an angle.
             -Okay.

 So I'm cutting these asparagus.

      Chef Rob says I need
         to go flatter.

        A little bit more angle,
                 45-degree.

              More, more, more.

       "More of an angle,
        more of an angle,

      more of an angle,"
       more of an angle?

  Next thing I know, I'm gonna
    be cutting into the sky.

             Give me the knife.

                    Look.
                 Gimme this.

       Really?

  That is blatantly
 against the rules.

         I didn't touch anything
              that he's doing.

              Guys!
      I'm already stressed.

 Not allowed today.
                Give me a break.

  What do you mean,
  give you a break?

              -Shh!
        -I picked up one.

 That's exactly what

you are not allowed to do!
       I picked up an asparagus!

         Back-and-forth,
      and we got the eagle

 and the hawk just goin' at it.

     [<i> Piercing eagle cry</i> ]

       [<i> Hawk squawking</i> ]

          Aah! Help me!

           [<i> Cawing</i> ]

              Look. Gimme this.

       Really?

        -I picked up one.
      -That's exactly what

you are not allowed to do!
       I picked up an asparagus!

  Oh, my god.
          Oh, brother.

 [ Piano plays melancholy tune ]
      <i> Don't let asparagus</i>

    <i> tear your family apart.</i>

                     â™ªâ™ª

  [ Suspenseful chord strikes ]

   [gruffly] Yeah!
 Get right in there.

      I feel like I'm doing
        a really good job

       and that I'm making
     Chef Anne proud today.

Let's move on to pesto.

 To the pistachios.

     Olive oil.

   Let's taste it
and see where we are.

  What do you think
   about the salt?

  Throughout this competition,
 I've had challenges where I've

   overseasoned and challenges
  where I have under-seasoned.

        We didn't want it
       too salty, did we?

No, but we wanted it
   to taste good.

 Now, I have to trust<i> my</i> palate
   and just hope for the best.

   So a little bit more salt.

         It's gotta go all over.
               You gotta move.

      The veal is gonna be
     the star of this dish.

  I have to make sure that it's
seasoned well, cooked perfectly.

              You want that pan
             nice and hot. Yes.

                  Come on.
             You gotta be quick.

I just need to kind of replicate
 what I did yesterday, honestly.

   [ Triumphant music plays ]

         That's amazing!

            Oh, hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!

                            â™ªâ™ª

                 Check that.

    But, today, I got a bunch

     of different-sized veal
        in the same pan.

   There's different hot spots
           on the pan.

      You know they're not
        cooking the same.

                  No good.
                Turn it off.

          I want you to just put
           that butter and stuff

                over the top
           of the veal, quickly.

             -Aggh!
        -Come on, butter.

                It's [bleep]
                there, dude.

  Butter makes everything good.

     10 minutes.
We're counting down.

Now, I just want you
  to focus on fish.

   Press it down.

  More.
          [<i> Squelch!</i> ]

I mean, don't squash
      the fish,

but you really wanna
  get that crusted.

        Good.
 Yeah, there you go.

       I only have so many
         pieces of fish,

     so I have to be careful
  because it could easily burn.

Okay, add the other pan
    right on top.

Just give it a little
pressure for a second.

 There you go, good.

              Asparagus can go
                  in there.

        Come on. [snaps fingers]
           I'm rushing you, now.

       Now, we're cookin'.
        I'm ready to go.

                You gotta do
             two things at once.

              Okay.
    I got my polenta goin'...

                  Stir it.
                That's great.

    ...my sautÃ©ed veggies...

               Toss them, yes,
                  quickly.

       ...roasted veggies.

                 So put this
           in the oven, quickly.

            My sauce,
     I got that kinda goin'.

        You're gonna strain that
               into that pan.

                 Good. Okay.

     [snapping fingers] Quickly,
              quickly, quickly.

          Pull it up or stir it.

         I got all kinds
        of things goin'.

     I feel like an octopus
        with eight arms.

                            â™ªâ™ª

     5 minutes!

  Make your swoosh.

 Yeah! There you go.

              Now take a scoop
             of celeriac, pull.

                 Just tap it
              and then do that.

             No, no. More down.

     Chef Rob is so serious
  about this plating technique.

             Same thing with the
              polenta, that you

             don't play with it.
             Don't play with it.

   He's like "Once you do it,
           it's over!

       You can't fix it!"

          -Be careful.
        -"Be carefu-u-l!"

                Cauliflower,
                cauliflower.

          Cauliflower?!

         I forgot I was
    even cookin' cauliflower!

              It may be burnt,
       so you better get it out.

            Good put it back in.

           Just that was a test.

           [<i> Rattle!</i> ]

Asparagus on your plate.

     All right.
Let's go, quick-quick.

     [clapping]
 Let's go. Let's go.

    There you go.
      Fish on.

              One minute left!

             No, no, no, no, no.
       Yes, but facing this way.

       I put it this way.
     He's like "No, no, no!"

            Yes. No, no, no, no.
               Yes, beautiful.

      I go in a 360 motion.

                    Yes.

       That's how I had it
       in the first place!

 Here, just get that
little drip right there.

                  10, 9, 8,

                    7, 6,

Hands up. You're done!

      Good job.

    I'm lookin' at my entrÃ©es
        and I'm thinking,

        "I can't believe
         I made these."

            BRADLEY:

   I see how good that looks.

              Looks beautiful.

   Ready for the main course.
         Oh, here it is.

           MELBA: Wow.
      -WOMAN #2: Dish X is

      herb-crusted halibut
    with a cauliflower purÃ©e,

           asparagus,
      and pistachio pesto.

            WOMAN #2:
 And dish Y is a veal medallion

       with a cauliflower-
       and-celeriac purÃ©e,

       polenta, as well as
       roasted vegetables.

     Dish X looks beautiful.

     -I'm excited to dig in.
      -Yeah, let's dig in.

      This crisp skin, let's see
             if we can hear it.

           -Oh, yeah.
     -MELBA: Oh, wonderful.

              Mmm!
      -Wow, that is cooked

        just beautifully.

          In terms of technique,
                 this person

                really nailed
          the cauliflower purÃ©e.

    [ Whimsical tune plays ]
 The technique is gorgeous, but,

  I think it's under-seasoned.

                We need salt,
                in a big way.

  I agree with you,
   but the pesto,

it's that extra oomph

that the halibut really,
   really needed,

so, when you combine
the two of them together,

     it kinda hits the mark.
             -True.

       Let's go to dish Y.

           It's heavy.
      This is a heavy dish.

Also the presentation
    of the dish.

       I'm very impressed.
        -You guys ready?

           -I'm ready.
    -I'm was waitin' for you.

     -Yeah, I know. Come on.
       Let's go. Let's go.

     Yours look a little...
           -Underdone.

             DAVID:
        One of mine was.
       One of mine wasn't.

And the other one wasn't,
 same thing with me.

      But this is out-of-control
                 delicious.

                [ Laughing ]

    It's a party in my mouth.

     [ Upbeat music plays ]

              The biggest thing
               that's missing

    [ Whimsical tune plays ]
          is any kind of crunch.

           All of the vegetables
               are overcooked.

              -Mm.
      -Except the carrots.

         They're under-.
  -We saw purÃ©e of cauliflower

        on both of these plates.

 It's a cauliflower
  party right now.

    I love the texture of X,
   but I love the flavor of Y.

Maybe they should join together.
              -Mm!

   I cannot wait for dessert.

      Me, too.

     All right.
   The last round.

     Here we go!
     30 minutes,

and your time starts
     right now.

                     Go.

   Biscuits, baby.

  1 cup of flower.

     My biscuits today need
         to be perfect.

2 tablespoons sugar.

 They have to be kinda crumbly,
       but a little moist.

Now pulse, pulse, pulse,

   'til it's like
   grated cheese.

           -Oh, yeah.
          -That is it.

             Lookit!
   -Now it's comin' together.

I love that you knew exactly
what you're looking for.

 There you go, babe.
   [snaps fingers]

       [ Bluegrass plays ]

       Use a knife. Use a knife.
               Come on, dude.

         The first thing
      I'm gonna have to do

         is to take care
   of my graham-cracker crust.

             1.25 cups of sugar.

 It's definitely nerve-racking.

            The crust
      has gotta be perfect.

                  Break it.

  I gotta make sure the texture
        is not too thick;

     but also not too thin,
     to where it crumbles...

               Do the butter.
                There you go.

           Get it in. Get it in.
                 Get it in.

        ...which is like
     a hard balance to get.

               Don't be afraid
         to push it down, right?

 So, while that is in the oven,
  I gotta work on this filling.

              Six yolks, right,
          bring the bowl to you.

               Bring the bowl
               to you, right.

     I got my six egg yolks.

     I got my condensed milk
           in there...

            Quick, quick, quick.

      ...and I'm just goin'
     to town on these lime.

         Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

        After 10 minutes,
      I pull my crust out.

              Ugh!

             Aaaaah!

  I didn't pat 'em down enough.

   The pie crust is taking up
        the entire tray.

    It poofed up, and there's
     no room for my filling.

    It'll just be all crust.

           That's it.
         It's game over.

 [ Suspenseful chords striking ]

             Aaaaah!

   The pie crust is taking up
        the entire tray.

    It poofed up, and there's
     no room for my filling.

    I don't know what to do.

   We need to push them down.

    I grab my measuring cup,
 and I just try to pat it down.

 Push it down like you mean it.

  Don't treat it like a [BLEEP]
        [BLEEP] [BLEEP].

     It's like that already?

  He drives me nuts sometimes.

       Just push it down.

   I think they're gonna work,
    so I throw in my filling.

   Don't overfill them, right?

         Keep going. Keep going.
         Keep going. Keep going.

     Stop, stop, stop, stop.

 The crust looks a little thick.

       I'm not gonna lie,

    but it has a good amount
       of custard in there

       so that the balance
   is not that bad hopefully.

        Make some toads.

             Great.
           All right.

     Now the turbinado sugar
           on the top,

   just a little sprinky dink.

   Then you'll feel it crunch
        when you bite it.

          In the oven.

   That's what we call working
          with purpose.

My dessert sauce is on the heat.

   I got to get that strained
      and reduce that down

     to a nice consistency,
   but Chef Rob is in my ear.

     Put the spoon in there.
    It's really frustrating.

       Hold it over there
      with the right hand,

    and with your left hand,
        you're gonna pour

       all that in there.
              Okay.

  Take another pan in one hand,
           that hand.

         Put that there.

   With that hand, I want you
   to pour that back in there.

           All right.

    Berries, and you can work
     on your cutting board.

      So now I'm macerating
   the berries for my dessert.

       Be careful, Sarah,
         of the greens.

           All right?
 Because you don't want to have

    to go back and pick them
        out later, right?

   I'm getting nervous because

       I want to make sure
        I get them right.

   Relax, relax, relax, okay?
              Okay.

       Whew, smile, enjoy.

     Be Cactus Flower, okay?

   But I'm just trying to stay
       cool and collected,

       and I'm gonna whip
       to the finish line.

           Smell that.
            So good.

 Ah, see, that makes you smile,
             right?

         Take them out.
         Take them out.

 I take my pies out of the oven.

  The crust, I know it's thick
        because I am able

 to pick these up with my hands,
    so they're pretty solid.

  I'm hoping that it's not hard
         to cut through.

             [BLEEP]
      Know what that sounds

        like over there?

            Nervous.

        So I hear Bradley
    struggling a little bit.

       A little bit more?
   No, throw it away, quickly.

   Add more cream, any cream.

         but I'm feeling
        pretty confident

   as I'm layering my dessert.

     Now, nice, big spoonful
           of berries.

             Great.
    Scoop it from the middle.

     There you go, Muscles.

      That's how you do it
       in Oklahoma, right?

    One spoon in the middle,
     put them on the sauce.

  Whipped cream, yes, gorgeous.

      Right in the middle.
           That's it.

         Thirty seconds.

             Raspberries, quick.

    More berries
 on the second one.

           Yeah, yeah.
            Drop it.

            Drop it.
            Drop it.

  Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
              five,

          four, three,
      two, one, that's it.

     Hands up, you're done.

      I feel accomplished.

At the same time, I feel worried
      because I don't know

     what they're gonna say
         about my food.

      I am so proud of you.

   I can't believe I just made
      a three-course meal.

        It is over with.

    Now we just have to wait
         on the judges.

            Good job.

  Oh, here it comes, everybody.

        Oh, my goodness.

Dish X is a strawberry-raspberry
       shortcake parfait,

  and dish Y is a Key lime pie.

   Dish X, it looks beautiful.

                     â™ªâ™ª

         It's fantastic.
        Oh, my goodness.

     It's stuck in my throat
      right now, actually.

               Mm.

       I think the crumble
      is really well-made.

   It's almost like a cookie,
       caramelized butter,

     a nice amount of sugar.

   It has a lot of flavoring.

  I'm not getting much crumble.
            Dig deep.

         Go to the core.
              Okay.

        I'm just getting
       a lot of ice cream.

    Yeah, I didn't get enough
         crumble either.

 What we're all struggling with
        is trying to get

      any combination of it
       to happen together.

   It just is very hodgepodge.

      You know, the beauty
 of a parfait is you're sort of

  looking at it layer by layer,

          the elevator
    going up through flavors.

      There was no elevator
        in this building.

       There is something
        that's wonderful,

 warm and comforting about this.
           It's true.

 So let's try the Key lime pie.

      I love Key lime pie.

    Yeah, I'm super excited.
          I'm going in.

   I love that creamy texture
        of the Key lime.

   I just have to get through
      the crust, of course.

              Ooh.
             Uh-oh.

     Can I have a chainsaw?

        [<i> Saw whirring</i> ]

    [ Ominous chord strikes ]

     I can't cut the bottom.

              It is. It's thick
               on the bottom.

I'm going oldschool.

    The filling is fantastic.

      It's nice and smooth.

       The whipped cream,
        <i> very</i> well done.

           Look how glossy it is
                 on the top.

   It's<i> beautiful.</i>

             Set up beautifully,
             not too gelatinous,

        really exquisitely done.

 I mean, the crust,
of course, we all know

 the crust could've
definitely been thinner,

 but this is working
       for me.

I'm loving the sweetness
    of the sauce

      combined
 with the creaminess

  and the tartness
  of the Key lime.

   Well, this has been amazing

      and I'm so impressed
 with what these guys have done

      and this is gonna be
     really hard to decide.

                 There were
            some real hits here.

                 I am<i> really</i>
                 blown away.

 It was really good.

     I'm really
pleasantly surprised

 and very impressed.

          Well, I think
     it's a tough one, but,

    I think we have a winner.

          -I think so.
     -I think you're right.

                     â™ªâ™ª

      Just seven weeks ago,

   these two recruits were<i> the</i>
     worst cooks in America.

    We have put them through
   a<i> seriously</i> tough boot camp

     and these are the last
     two recruits standing.

        This is Bradley,
      that produced meal Y.

              Nice to meet you.
              Nice to meet you.

  And this is Sarah, also known
  as Princess Cactus Flower...

          [ Laughter ]

     ...who prepared meal X.
             -Hello.

        What we saw today
      was truly tremendous

          and you guys
       should be<i> so</i> proud.

           -Thank you.
           -Thank you.

           All right.
     So we're gonna go ahead

         and get started
      with the appetizers,

starting, Sarah, with your dish,
 the ravioli with the sweet peas

 and the delicious butter sauce.

          First of all,
   I was particularly shocked

      that you had to make
   that ravioli from scratch.

   The edges felt a little bit
 stiffer than we would've liked,

      but the dough itself
   was perfect and beautiful.

        We would've liked
     a little bit more salt

     and it would have been
 an absolute home run of a dish.

           -Thank you.
      -Bradley, your dish,

      which was, of course,
        the red snapper,

     right out of the gates,
       we were blown away

    by how perfectly prepared
         your fish was.

  The salad was powerful, too,

        but the red onion
        was overwhelming.

 I think something that pungent,
        just shave it up

       so that it has just
          that essence,

        but again, it was
   a extremely masterful dish.

           -Thank you.
    -So the entrÃ©e: Overall,

  this course, for both of you,
    was your shining dishes.

       Sarah, the halibut
          was the<i> star.</i>

   The cauliflower was cooked
          <i> beautifully.</i>

 [ Whimsical-suspenseful tune ]
    But flavor, [clap] salt.

      The pesto was really
         well-seasoned,

   but the rest of it lacked,
         unfortunately.

      Bradley, the veal was
         <i> really</i> lovely,

        cauliflower purÃ©e
      was really beautiful,

        and the flavoring
      was all really good.

    But one of my medallions
      was really well done

        and the other one
        was a little raw,

    so it was a little like,
    ahh...not<i> exactly</i> there.

So, when I think about desserts,
  I think about the sweet treat

         that kinda ties
        it all together.

       Sarah, the parfait.

     The crumble was divine.

        Only problem was,
   I didn't get enough of it.

       However, the taste
         was wonderful.

    Dish Y, the Key lime pie,
          OMG, divine.

     The Key line, the sauce
  around it, it was beautiful.

     However, the crust was
         very, very hard

     and I think we all had
        a difficult time

       cutting through it.
  But it was definitely tasty.

       Once again, this is
    a<i> very</i> difficult decision

     and we really came down
         to these really

  [ Suspenseful music climbs ]
        nitpicky things.

        Both of you guys
       should be so proud,

     but we<i> do</i> have to crown
        someone a winner

 and give that money to someone,
        and the winner is

  [ Suspenseful music climbs ]

            Bradley.

   [ Triumphant music plays ]
    [ Laughter and applause ]

    Holy [bleep]

    I'm no longer the worst!

    [ Laughter and applause ]

     I made you proud, Mama!

                  $25,000!

     I'm gonna take everyone
          on vacation!

 I'm just ridiculously grateful.

        Thank you, Chef,
    for showing me the ropes.

     I just put so much work
         into this that,

       to have it pay off
           at the end,

  it just means so much to me,
     and to be able to go up

       against competition
    like Chef Anne and Sarah,

       thank you for being
 such a good competitor as well.

    This experience has been
         pretty amazing.

         You did an amazing job.

    I'm just proud of myself
     for how far I've come.

I'm taking my new cooking skills
    back to Oklahoma, y'all.

        -Congratulations.
-First person I'm gonna cook for

   when I get home is my mama.

         Let's go, boy!
