Translated by Suurtje 
control: Suurtje and Teq -- 

25 
Since the beginning of time, travel 
a space to dream. 

26 
The rocket made sure the 
reality was. 

27 
But before these people gigantic 
step were proud ... 

28 
the brave stepped into the rocket. 

29 
And the brave were chimpanzees. 

30 
Ham I was the first American ... 

31 
who was outspoken in which no man or 
chimpanzee had been previously. 

32 
And tonight his brave legacy lives on. 

33 
I suggest to you Ham III. 
Ham his only real grandson. 

34 
Thank you, no signatures. 
Give Photos. 

35 
Well, then do photos. 
Which I sign later. 

36 
Ladies and gentlemen, you make, if we 
on a mission to the stars go. 

37 
The space, stars, enough with the lessons, 
let's do something about this. 

38 
Do you have to wear seatbelts. 
Kin down, "thumb claw" to the inside ... 

39 
if you make sure you do not include 
me, Houston. The area is in my veins. 

40 
And between your ears. 
It is time for the show. 

41 
Come on. Make some noise. 
We are going crazy. 

42 
Let you be surprised. 

43 
Let this candle lighting. 

44 
Three, two, one ... 

45 
takeoff. 

46 
Ladies. 

47 
And back again. 

48 
It seems like a dream. 

49 
Keep your eyes on 
the landing gear. 

50 
No nonsense. Stay focused on your goal. 

51 
The grand finale is coming. 

52 
And a KOPROL. 

53 
And a 'Dipsy'. 
And a duke. " 

54 
Always steal the show. 

55 
It is okay people. 
Therefore, I have the helmet when the monkey gained. 

56 
The infinity probe 'is successful 
'Luna Orbit' passed. 

57 
The status is unmanned and 
remotely operated. 

58 
Mission: "to look for life." 

59 
Discovered unidentified 
space details. 

60 
Warning: 'system works poorly. " 

61 
System works poorly. 

62 
Come here, little butterfly. 

63 
No, Zartog. 

64 
You can not read. 
Stay at my house away. 

65 
Sample. 

66 
If I could get you to tackle rogue, 
I would also yours in the 'Fresnar' stop. 

67 
I wonder why everyone 
in the city you hate. 

68 
I also like to have. 

69 
Look, it comes closer. 
It is a beast from the air. 

70 
My house. 

71 
A gift from the air. 

72 
I am the 'Infinity Probe' of 
the planet Earth. 

73 
We will now have a fully 
physical research. 

74 
Only for scientific 
purposes. 

75 
Since the beginning of the time 
the unbridled spirit of man ... 

76 
great achievements made 
in culture and civilization. 

77 
This creativity is reflected in architecture, 
art, music, design ... 

78 
but people do not always 
He would also like to play. 

79 
So let me live. 

80 
The audit of the information system 
in business. 

81 
Manual override takes place. 

82 
A new day has come, and 
that day is Zartog. 

83 
A amphibians program 
began in the sixties. 

84 
And these chimpanzees are like those 
which are used in the first space travel. 

85 
Why, they go to space? 

86 
They do not. They let alone 
see the past. 

87 
What is it, Comet? 

88 
I do not know, but it is 
something big. 

89 
What do you mean, gone? 

90 
Senator, the Infinity from his stance 
waived by ... 

91 
a magnetic attraction 
one-dimensional deviation ... 

92 
in time, space continuum. 

93 
In English. 

94 
It is sucked into a wormhole. 

95 
My constituents care about holes 
no worm holes. 

96 
You know how many holes we can leave 
for five trillion dollars? 

97 
Strength three. 

98 
50,600,000, which depends on 
off the track. 

99 
Labor costs. 
And overtime. 

100 
It was just a question, dab. 

101 
Our data show that the 'Infinity' is 
have emerged on the other side of the universe. 

102 
As you can see from this picture ... 

103 
is the 'Infinity' landed on a planet 
in a large field with H2O. 

104 
That means water. 
I know what it means. 

105 
Senator, as the atmosphere 
life is fruitful ... 

106 
would there be life on the planet. 

107 
Perhaps even more extensive form. 

108 
This could prove what we 
all the time had already suspected. 

109 
We are not alone. 

110 
Imagine what a mission 
Science could do. 

111 
Not to mention the sale of T shirts. 

112 
Political gold. I would immediately 
astronauts to have. 

113 
That does not happen. 
Too dangerous for humans. 

114 
We have no idea how effect 
the wormhole has on human tissue. 

115 
It would be the DNA can change. 

116 
You would be blind. 
Heart problems. 

117 
Very likely, death. 

118 
Moving. 

119 
What are you doing? 

120 
Our mission delivery. 

121 
We were able to send the chimpanzees. 
Chimpanzees? 

122 
Chimpanzees? No people, but 
not horrible. 

123 
Tell me what you got. 
Guys, we have a mission. 

124 
Senator, Titan, Luna, and Comet are fully 
prepared for the mission. 

125 
They have their whole life 
trained for. 

126 
Training, worthless. 
Those chimpanzees are boring. 

127 
They are gawky chimpanzee. 

128 
I can not believe it. 
There are no gawky in their world. 

129 
I know a Klungel when I see one. 

130 
Do you think he means that 
we are gawky? 

131 
No, we are super cool. 

132 
What this mission needs is what 
publicity. 

133 
What crackling, to the attention 
of the media to draw. 

134 
There we have the right chimpanzee 
need. 

135 
We have someone like him if necessary. 

136 
A real hero. With dignity 
and nobility. 

137 
He has been dead thirty years. 

138 
But he does have a grandson. 

139 
What a pain. 

140 
When I was your grandfather had promised 
that I would fit on your ... 

141 
I had never thought that I every night 
'Mikado' would play with monkey bones. 

142 
What can I say, I am a doordouwer. 
I can do nothing but half. 

143 
So if you steal the show continues, I 
you halfway opzetter animals. 

144 
You can not take him. 
He is mine. 

145 
Official government business. 
The national security ... 

146 
and a whole lot of other nonsense, where 
you do not want to make us their horns. 

147 
He is older than I had expected. 

148 
You're no spring chicken anymore. 

149 
And you're looking for ... 

150 
He is so cute. 

151 
I'm Dr. Smothers, and you 
goes to space. 

152 
Like your grandfather. 
The space? 

153 
Wrong answer. You have the wrong 
Hamm, doctor. 

154 
Day lady from the area, 
who is attracted to me. 

155 
Good to see you. Take care, 
only at the door. 

156 
He seems very excited to go. 

157 
Child you throw away the only chance 
you have. 

158 
This is the chance to make up. 
To see your legacy to life. 

159 
I'm the star of my show. 

160 
Not as a work of art by one or other 
human astronaut. 

161 
Your grandfather was not one or 
other artwork. 

162 
He was a NASA astronaut. 

163 
He was in magazines, newspapers, 
television ... 

164 
he has even met the president. 

165 
I have even met the chief of police. 

166 
He has done something to be proud of. 

167 
He had a dream and there is gone. 

168 
Did you dream? 
I live my dream. 

169 
Houston, we have a problem. 

170 
Thank you your government supports. 

171 
I'm just before the court. 

172 
I want that back home. 

173 
It seems that we 
A new pill need. 

174 
Keep you travel? 

175 
Here he comes. 
Stand upright proud. 

176 
I can not believe we are going to fly 
with the grandson of the great Ham. 

177 
Are you sure this is the grandson? 

178 
I know my rights. I go 
the ASPCA 'call. 

179 
I demand that my director of the circus 
get to speak. 

180 
Help, I'm kidnapped. 

181 
He is clearly excited to 
to a new environment. 

182 
Good glass. 

183 
Commander Titan, navigation 
and coordination. 

184 
Ham does not. 
And it may not care. 

185 
Lieutenant Luna, it's an honor. 

186 
Hello, ladies chimpanzee. 

187 
I hope you do not care, 
Luna means' Monday 'in Latin. 

188 
That's right, sir. 

189 
If you me. Two lovers of language. 

190 
The name is Comet. 
Computers and Electronics. 

191 
I am there to serve under you. 
I am sorry kid, but I am not staying here. 

192 
I have to play Saturday for children. 

193 
Let's go, Houston. 
With all due respect, sir ... 

194 
you are selected for a mission, 
of historic importance ... 

195 
and someone with great conviction ... 
Yes, 'Land of the Free. Home of the Brave. " 

196 
Listen. The only mission that I have 
to entertain. 

197 
Watch and learn. 

198 
He is a joke. 

199 
Good luck. Success; inflammation, 
what you say. I gotta go. 

200 
What are they? 

201 
Space suits. We demonstrate that 
Saturday morning for the press. 

202 
My ticket home. 

203 
Flight from fear. 
Zartog Lord is near. 

204 
We are now aware of ... 

205 
the power of stupid, that I can call 
with my big shiny machine. 

206 
Is there anyone among you who are against 
My rule is? 

207 
So you say that you have the lead ... 

208 
because this thing has landed on your cabin? 

209 
Yes, and if you disobey me, 
I will be yours in the 'Fresnar' throw. 

210 
That you do not. 
I will forever be frozen. 

211 
That's right. 

212 
Want someone else might 
just dive? 

213 
Well. Go all the work. 

214 
Let's start with this party. The "Infinity" 
has 10 Gs in the wormhole included. 

215 
If the internal pressure gravity 
can not resist ... 

216 
it will explode like a cup in 
the microwave. 

217 
Then their brains and their guts 
be crushed. 

218 
Your gravity works amazing. 

219 
Here comes force five. 
Here comes force six. 

220 
This thing goes so fast. 

221 
Seven G. 
Eight G. 

222 
This is perhaps a strange time 
to ask you ... 

223 
do you want me next week to help move? 

224 
I do not have much stuff, but 
we make it a fun day. 

225 
That was fun. 
Have you written? 

226 
My turn. 
Poor little Comet ... 

227 
he thinks that he goes into space. 

228 
Three seats, three chimpanzees. 

229 
Where do we eat? 

230 
I eat no fat food. 

231 
We need you here, Comet. 
Our eyes and ears. 

232 
Child, I have you ever been the story 
told of ... 

233 
short circuit and planes 
the first Mercury rocket. 

234 
Was that you? 
That was the day that his grandfather Ham ... 

235 
so easily went in the air, that 
a man could do. 

236 
I do not know what makes me happier ... 

237 
Einstein's field theory, or to 
monkeys look on a treadmill. 

238 
What? 

239 
And to think I almost at Harvard 
left to start a software company. 

240 
Who's laughing now, Bill Gates? 

241 
Order remember is a test 
for his chimpanzee brain capacity. 

242 
You want to jam? 

243 
When you gonna get right to 
, and fly well. 

244 
Saturday, for about ten hours. 

245 
I got these radios for the trip, I 
think that they can work through the wormhole. 

246 
Have you made? 
I'm good with machines. 

247 
Listen kid, thank you for that banana 
but I did not need him. 

248 
I take the radio did. 

249 
Special Edition 'Simmion Space Shade. " 

250 
Thank you. Nice. 

251 
My fellow citizens. 

252 
This mission will be right by the cosmos 
go ... 

253 
where we finally answer 
the age-old questions hoping to get ... 

254 
there is intelligent life? 

255 
Check the steering of the rocket. 

256 
Judge Thumb is starting left thumb is stop. 
Up is right, down is left. 

257 
Judge Thumb is starting left thumb is stop. 

258 
Now you see it. Now you see it. 

259 
Good. Here he is. 

260 
I had hidden. 
You miss a schakeltje. 

261 
Come on, cannon ball. 
You are no longer with the circus. 

262 
This great leap by 
the wormhole to ... 

263 
involves much risk 
and danger. 

264 
Who will open this road for us? 

265 
The few, the proud, 
the monkeys. 

266 
Great. 

267 
A historic moment, and here he is ... 

268 
a symbol of our country and 
the greatness of our future ... 

269 
Ham III. 

270 
Thank you! 

271 
The circus, and beyond. 

272 
That must hurt. 

273 
If he loses backpack. 

274 
Get out of the way. I am going on. 

275 
The game has become a chimpanzee. 

276 
Head up. 
Run for your life, kids. 

277 
I'm on TV. 

278 
This is not good. 

279 
That is not good. 

280 
He is a joke. 

281 
Which way to the circus? 

282 
Load them up. 

283 
What kind of simulator is this? 

284 
It looks very realistic off. 
It is. 

285 
That I have thrown out. 

286 
Wait, just not. 

287 
Everything is good with me. 
Where are we now? 

288 
The simulator is getting smaller and smaller. 

289 
This is not a simulation, do you? 

290 
We are now officially "Space Chimps." 

291 
The 'Horizon', the first phase 
of the operation completed. 

292 
Great. 
There they go. 

293 
Congratulations on ourselves. 

294 
That is too upright. 

295 
What a donkey. 

296 
You're doing it all wrong. 

297 
Move them higher. 

298 
Put them in a row. 

299 
Careful with that. 
It has cost me a day to throw. 

300 
Splork? 
Yes, Lord Zartog.

301 
Kneel before Lord Zartog. 
Yes, Lord Zartog. 

302 
Soon, the house of Zartog ready. 
It is great. 

303 
It is a shame that the volcano 
it will destroy ... 

304 
as the three suns in a row, 
on 'triple Sunday. " 

305 
I am a volcano that step. 

306 
I therefore construction. 

307 
These vibrations, the 'Fresnar' 
safe redirect. 

308 
Nothing will be the home of Zartog 
ever destroyed. 

309 
But if you 'Fresnar' 
of the volcano redirects ... 

310 
will be buried the entire village. 

311 
Exactly. An inglorious reflective pond, 
to my glory to reflect. 

312 
Resplendent. 
Where should we all live? 

313 
With me, in my dungeon. 

314 
How nice of you, my Lord. 

315 
The logbook of the captain, 
begins now. 

316 
Space, the final frontier. 

317 
Do you have a pillow and blanket for me? 
Stay in your chair. 

318 
That is a prescription. 
I got brave ... 

319 
Look, no hands, feet, 
no tail. 

320 
On earth would you disobedient behavior 
you bring the chimpanzee court. 

321 
That you do not go the whole journey do? 
What? 

322 
Chimpanzee to use words 
to be replaced? 

323 
I'm going to murder him. 

324 
Commander, violence is not allowed 
according to the Constitution of primates. 

325 
You're right, Lieutenant. 
Is love permitted ... 

326 
according to the Constitution of primates? 

327 
Listen and learn, cannon ball. 
The approach sequence ... 

328 
should be activated. 
... Ignited engines 

329 
in the correct position and fast. 
The judge first ... 

330 
lower as the latest, meanwhile pressure 
365, if you want to stay alive. 

331 
Permission to speak, commander. 
Allowed. 

332 
You're a dommerd. 
I like you not. 

333 
Connect 3D Matrix. 
Visual image is ready. 

334 
Fire 'Photon torpedoes' off. 

335 
It says' go 'on, cannon ball. 

336 
Yes? Prove it. 

337 
Titan, do not. 

338 
Right at the mission. 

339 
I am sorry. 
How will we mention our children? 

340 
What? I go off. 
You go countries. 

341 
Stabilizers, controlled. 

342 
Emergency propellers, monitored. 

343 
Collision detector checked. 

344 
Circus sample. 

345 
I can not 173 light years conventions. 

346 
I got you. 

347 
With the fur, bad George. 

348 
Disobey a crew member 
is caught. 

349 
And according to rule 815 ... 
What is rule 815? 

350 
Guys, I have to pee. 

351 
If you have on suction. 

352 
We are indeed the toilet paper 
lost. 

353 
Not my fault. 

354 
And there is one rule for declaration. 

355 
I am pleased that we are not in that 
crazy-looking thing going. 

356 
Sorry if I'm on a mission, I 
only real astronauts heard. 

357 
Who told you then, 'Sorry'? 

358 
Someone else. 
Why did you say than "someone else"? 

359 
Poop gym slip. 
Maybe there is music on the radio. 

360 
Approaching different entrance. 
We must have that threshold. 

361 
Approaching, 5G, 6G. 

362 
8G. 

363 
Come on. Where is this thing in reverse? 

364 
Welcome to The Star. 
Thank God. 

365 
How can I help you? 

366 
The "Horizon" is the wormhole addressed. 
Wonderful. 

367 
Did signal about 12 minutes and 
20 seconds needed. 

368 
This better work. 
We have three chimpanzees ... 

369 
fastened in a spaceship 
of 3.7 trillion. What can go wrong? 

370 
Fun, a planet. 
We go there right away. 

371 
My God, we go there right away. 

372 
Wake up. 
You need this thing countries. 

373 
No reason for panic. You will only 
but through a wormhole ... 

374 
on the other side of the universe 
with nine thousand miles per hour ... 

375 
and no brakes. Come on. 

376 
Steering wheel? 

377 
Let one of these please 
are a force. 

378 
Please. 

379 
Airbags unfolded. 
I did it. 

380 
I am the smartest chimpanzee 
of the universe. 

381 
That was not so bad. 
Ship is stable. 

382 
Signal on, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

383 
Just wait, please. 

384 
I just go to 'Kinkoo's. 
If someone wants me to look at their list? 

385 
You lost the ship? 
It must be a kind of technical problem. 

386 
Microwave popcorn to burn, 
is a technical problem. 

387 
This is a disaster of one trillion dollars. 

388 
3.7 to be exact. 
Look at it from the sunny side. 

389 
If they do not come back to save us 
5000 dollars to cake and balloons. 

390 
We can always count on the'24 hour 
failure / safety system. " 

391 
You have 24 hours to 
that chimpanzees back, or ... 

392 
I stop the funding, and make this 
space program to history. 

393 
I mean every penny. You can not yet 
once 'zakbeschermers' can buy. 

394 
Sample. 
Remember, not dollars. Not Buck Rogers. 

395 
I love Buck Rogers. 
Who is Buck Rogers? 

396 
They have lost contact. 
Comet for Luna. 

397 
Answer me, Luna. 

398 
It must be a volcanic eruption to 
the surface of the sun. - What? 

399 
The central computer does not 
by the signal. 

400 
When I was younger, 
we just screamed louder. 

401 
Great, we landed at Barstow. 

402 
Take a look. Elephants are peanut chess. 
No, no. 

403 
The hall of the circus. The circus directors 
Hugo. Houston are bananas cabinet. 

404 
One small step for Ham ... 

405 
another small step for Ham ... 

406 
and another small step. 
What are you doing here? 

407 
Testing gravity. 
Yes, it works. 

408 
Who has given you permission 
in order to open the hatch? 

409 
Commander. 

410 
You are a risk for this mission. 

411 
A risk? I was sending when you and 
Commander Como were sleeping. 

412 
You stayed awake, and you have the landing gear 
not activated? 

413 
That you just had to do. 
Not true. 

414 
I had my 'panic' 
to catch up. 

415 
Do not. 
What? 

416 
The air may have been poisoned. 

417 
Poisoned air. 

418 
The log of the lieutenant ... 
I stitching. 

419 
you can breathe the air. 
I crave air. 

420 
The temperature is normal. 
I'm dying. 

421 
Overwin the enemy of the day. 

422 
And there is no sign of intelligent life. 

423 
Look, the planet has three suns. 

424 
Amazing. Just as it is in 
a science fiction movie about another planet. 

425 
As you all know is tomorrow 
'triple Sunday. " 

426 
Our three suns together will be a 
and the volcano will explode. 

427 
In honor of this special day and 
More importantly, I do. 

428 
I give a party. A kind of 
'come to power' party. 

429 
Upper Lord. 
What? 

430 
There is another metal beast 
from the air cases. 

431 
A metal beast? Like this? 

432 
Only bigger. 

433 
Bigger than mine? 
It's not the size of the beast ... 

434 
what it does, because it is, my Lord. 

435 
Traitor. 
I am not a traitor. 

436 
Take it back. 
Well, I take it back. 

437 
You can not take back. 
You've said. 

438 
You have heard it all, right? 

439 
Me? 
Congratulations, you are the leader. 

440 
Find a few soldiers at each other, 
and bring that beast from the air at me. 

441 
That guy with long red belly, 
that guy with the funny hat, and ... 

442 
who is behind them. 
I will always be the last chosen. 

443 
Takeoff. 

444 
Take the 'Floofians. " 

445 
Imagine, we are the first astronauts 
who ever landed on this planet. 

446 
These photos will be front page news. 

447 
The most important images of the century. 

448 
Can you take one of my good side? 

449 
Forget. All my sides are good. 

450 
Maybe take it as a heroic, 
with my chin like that. 

451 
And another, like this one. 

452 
Always alert. Brute. 

453 
Ready to attack. 

454 
Candid. I have been frank. 
I'm been naughty. 

455 
Wait, Luna. I would not 
do if I were you. 

456 
This is the first sign of life, 
on an alien planet. 

457 
Astronauts gather knowledge, 
that is what we do. 

458 
I would just be more cautious. 
You, cautious? 

459 
I say only that this looks like 
a flower that 'Piddles "the clown used. 

460 
I must hear. 
'Piddles' is a really nice clown ... 

461 
which has a small fun box, 
covered with cute little flowers. 

462 
The kids think this is the best 
thing is that they have ever seen. 

463 
Until ... 

464 
a giant snake comes out jumping. 

465 
Please, I am a trained astronaut. 
I know what I do. 

466 
Trained astronaut? 
'Space Chimps' are a joke. 

467 
If you think about your grandfather? 

468 
Picking your flower now, then we 
back to earth. 

469 
If there is no movement in the wormhole, I can 
the show of eight hours in the circus still out. 

470 
Nervous scientific 
book worm. 

471 
What does' Piddles' next? 

472 
He usually throws confetti in the audience and 
then throw pies in his face. 

473 
I do not think that will help us. 
In my room manual ... 

474 
is there something solid, what we 
could do. 

475 
Alien capture, Alien uprising, 
Alien nothing about an investigation. 

476 
Manual is overwritten. 

477 
Confetti, I can not explain, 
it makes things just scared. 

478 
Are you sure they are not afraid 
for them. 

479 
I think that this sounds crazy, I think 
these guys are great. 

480 
Death to the foreigners. 
Great name for a band. 

481 
Titan, wake up. 

482 
The beast is out of us. 
Hurry, this way. 

483 
We can not leave the ship. Or Titan. 
It seems that they leave us. 

484 
Return to Lord Zartog. 

485 
Grab them. Fire. 

486 
You never had to leave the ship, 
it's all your fault. 

487 
I have not signed. 
I would now turn to the make up to sit ... 

488 
and not to sit on an extraterrestrial 
planet, and you must save. 

489 
You, who saves me? I am the astronaut, 
you're just a publicity stunt. 

490 
You're really sunk low. 
You've earned it. 

491 
No, I mean that you literally goes lower. 
We are at the sink. 

492 
I can not work out. 
Come on. as we say in the circus ... 

493 
the show ends yet, until the woman 
with the beard has reached the coast. 

494 
It is just as disgusting as it sounds. 

495 
Climb on my shoulders and get that fixed. 

496 
Sorry, that's my leg. 

497 
They are in the swamp. 
Val to. 

498 
What now? 
When the wind Slingeren. 

499 
Let your inner chimpanzee Friday. 

500 
Come on, Luna. As if you're on a trapeze. 
I am not at the circus. 

501 
Life is a circus, Luna. 
Only the tents are better. 

502 
I come save you. 

503 
I can not. I'm going to fall. 

504 
You can do it, Luna. 

505 
I can not. 
Use your shoulders, kick your legs ... 

506 
wave, and let go. 
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

507 
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

508 
Good. 
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

509 
The chimpanzee is released. 
Waving, let go. Look at this. 

510 
No. 

511 
There is nothing. Just a few monkeys 
by waving a jungle ... 

512 
with eyes and mouths. 
Eyes and mouths? 

513 
A snake, meet with hose two. 

514 
Grab him. 

515 
Time for a show. 

516 
Good afternoon, ladies. 

517 
What a first date, huh? 
This is not a date. 

518 
That's it. And I hope you really 
another to see, because we ... 

519 
will fall. 
Ham, what do we do now? 

520 
Mik at the soft spot, do you 
arms wide apart ... 

521 
chin down, "thumb claw" 
inside. 

522 
I hope you know what you do. 
Are you kidding? 

523 
I do this every day of the week. Except 
on Monday, that is my day off. 

524 
Luna, chin down. 

525 
Ham, everything is well with you? 

526 
Ham, get up. 
Come on, Ham. 

527 
I am sorry that I was so hard against you. 

528 
Of course, you irresponsible, 
dangerous and undisciplined ... 

529 
but you saved my life, and you 
're a little funny ... 

530 
in an incredible way annoying. 

531 
And you were ... 
Cute? - No. 

532 
Pretty? 
No. 

533 
As Brad Pitt, but less than 
and with more hair? 

534 
What? 
Luna, can you hear me? 

535 
Let me say one thing. 
Luna lives. 

536 
You're the most annoying, unpleasant, 
selfish creature that I've ever met. 

537 
Ham alive. 
Luna, Ham, you hear me? Answer. 

538 
You are shameless. 
We hear them, but they do not. 

539 
We need the Gregorian rate 
Customize ... 

540 
Helix move the mirror, 
and the staircase that goes around it crosses. 

541 
The only word that I verstond 
was' the '. 

542 
Mission log. We are stranded on 
a hostile alien planet. 

543 
Commander Titan is kidnapped. 
And we are in love. 

544 
No, that we are not. 
Ignore that last part. Clear off. 

545 
Kidnapped? 
Stranded? We have to go, kid. 

546 
We have only 22 hours before 
the autopilot is in force .. 

547 
and we stuck here forever. 
What do you mean, stuck? 

548 
The ship has a built 
security to automatically ... 

549 
back to earth to fly 24 hours after 
we land. It was in your manual. 

550 
Was that before or after the chapter that 
a rescue fleet would save us? 

551 
Ham, but we have a chance at home 
to come. 

552 
I've had worse opportunities. 
Let's go. 

553 
'Sky Beast 2, the Sequil. " 

554 
Greetings, extraterrestrial beings. 

555 
Do not worry, you've 
I'm not wake up. 

556 
I was still standing. 
I'm commander, Titan. 

557 
I've traveled through space, 
Case for knowledge. 

558 
To the ends of the universe 
to investigate. 

559 
Voted for the first contact made 
with extraterrestrial beings like you. 

560 
Grab you and take you to 
my planet. In order to decompose. 

561 
Decompose? 
We Then you lay down on ... 

562 
what with wax paper, cut you open 
with butter. 

563 
But first you must create a row, so 
I you can brands and cataloging. 

564 
Organism one, two, three. 

565 
I am Lord Zartog. 
Malgor ruler of the planet. 

566 
Zartog? Have your birds as you mentioned? 
Because you are different. 

567 
I like you. 
With a 'g' or two? 

568 
I assume that this one is. 

569 
Number four, five. 
There are a lot of you. 

570 
Sir, this is the property of 
the space agency. 

571 
That is a direct violation 
of the interstellar protocol. 

572 
If you cooperate with me I will tribunal 
ask to see your soft tackle. 

573 
Work with you? 
I'm going to destroy you. 

574 
I appreciate your honesty, 
you're a good man, Zartig. 

575 
And a worthy opponent, 
Orphan pride. 

576 
Be prepared to forever 
to be frozen. 

577 
You do not even know how the tissue forming 
micro locomotor to use. 

578 
Even a freshman can do that. 

579 
Do you want me the secrets of the beast 
show? 

580 
Negative. You're not trained, 
not qualified, and not even insured. 

581 
Please. I do everything. 

582 
You can help me my crew 
to find. 

583 
Are there more? 
Two others. 

584 
We are lost in the jungle 
of Gunglevick. 

585 
What idiot would go? 

586 
You gotta admit, to a strange 
alien planet, almost fun. 

587 
My whole life I have dreamed of for 
a real astronaut to be ... 

588 
just like your grandfather. 
And here I am. 

589 
Real astronauts? 
Wake up, Luna ... 

590 
the only reason why we are here is to 
to see if we explode in space. 

591 
You got it wrong, 
we are real astronauts. 

592 
Is one of us lost our flashlight? 

593 
It moves very fast. 
Along rocks ... 

594 
and has a head? 

595 
Nice. 
Please, I want you to do no harm. 

596 
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Luna. 

597 
I'm Hille Walle Wisa Seihua. 

598 
Great. It is drunk. 

599 
I am the last free from Lusian 
Kiloualawasahaui the village. 

600 
We come from the earth. 

601 
You know, the earth. ITunes, 
greenhouse effects, David Beckham ... 

602 
What is wrong with that 'glow in the dark' 
brainpan? 

603 
My head is light as I am afraid. 

604 
You need for us not to be afraid. 
We are your friends. 

605 
Friends. 

606 
Are you alone? 
Yes ... 

607 
my village is captured 
by Zartog and a beast from the air ... 

608 
his metal claws gave him the power 
to make slaves on the planet. 

609 
Metal claws? 
The Roover. " 

610 
We were also the stars. 
Yes, I see you crash. 

611 
Did you see that? 
That was me. 

612 
What? 
Do you know where our ship is? 

613 
In the palace of Zartog. 
Can you bring us go to that? 

614 
Do not worry. Us 
protect you, Killawallezalla ... 

615 
Let's say Kilowatt against her, otherwise 
we stand here all day. Or night. 

616 
We leave in the morning. 
The journey is dangerous. 

617 
We must reach the valley 
of very bad things go. 

618 
It is a country of unimaginable danger. 
torture pain and torture ... 

619 
not to mention alien flu, 
substance arches, flowers mad disease ... 

620 
the cave of the meat-consuming beast. 

621 
And the dark cloud of 'It' 
where none of escapes undamaged. 

622 
Sleep. You'll need your rest. 

623 
Stay on your side of the planet. 

624 
You have a rare earth 
way of love prove. 

625 
We have, or not? 

626 
Good night, sweetheart. 

627 
Wake up. 

628 
That was refreshing. We have ... 
Five seconds slept. 

629 
That's the benefit if you live in 
a planet with three suns. 

630 
Follow me. 

631 
Listen and learn. 

632 
The TR513I is a special vehicle, 
that is made to the area to investigate. 

633 
'Rocket and Ready "the designers, 
have equipped her ... 

634 
with a defense 
for every situation. 

635 
And the power station 
of 60 million kilowatts ... 

636 
ensures that it has enough energy 
until its work is done. 

637 
Ready to agree to run? 
Just what I had in mind. 

638 
That wait is so mindless. 

639 
I really needed a Snickers, and you? 
I'm allergic to peanuts. 

640 
This is even better than peanuts 
from the circus. 

641 
I still can not believe that 
the grandson of the great Ham is a clown. 

642 
I like what I do. 
Would not you be a hero? 

643 
You mean like a sandwich? 

644 
I wish I could welcome you 
called with fruit from our village, but ... 

645 
Zartog has destroyed all that. 

646 
We're sorry to hear that, Kilowatt. 

647 
Why would you build such a machine? 

648 
We have not done, but the people. 

649 
What are people? 
They are just like us. For nearly 99.9%. 

650 
But it is 0.1% which makes 
that they all possess. 

651 
Do not. 
But these are big sweets. 

652 
That is no food. 
That is a 'glophopper. " 

653 
Guys, I see this alone, 
or is that ... 

654 
or is that a truly beautiful 
stack 'glophoppers'? 

655 
Just watch this again. 

656 
Why some form of life 
you would like to imitate ... 

657 
is one of the unsolved mysteries 
of the universe. 

658 
Grab the scissors. 
The rug itself is cut. 

659 
I have never danced before. 

660 
Well. Then we take baby steps. 
Give me your arm. 

661 
Please. Not so bad. 
You're a natural talent. 

662 
Am I? Really? 

663 
Take you kidding me? 
Absolutely. 

664 
I'm at the pops, 
and also to the conclusion ... 

665 
the next stop, robot. 

666 
Rumba spin. 

667 
We can better run away. 

668 
Ham, we can not run faster 
than theirs. 

669 
That is why I have this for those guys. 

670 
They call me for nothing 
'the Hamster'. 

671 
It is just like that my name is Ham. 
And I am really rolling. 

672 
And run. 

673 
We should really stop that 
still practicing. 

674 
Wait, not yet go away, 
sweets people. 

675 
You can really stop. 
They are scared. 

676 
It is the cave 
the meat-consuming beast. 

677 
What is wrong with this planet? 

678 
You will die, if you have a cave 
with cute little chicks? 

679 
Ham, we have to finish this mission. 

680 
We have only twelve hours, 
before the ship departs. 

681 
By the cave. That is the only way 
to your ship. 

682 
Run. 
Come on, Luna. 

683 
I want this party forever 
reminded ... 

684 
better than something that Malgor 
has ever seen. 

685 
Then you need serpentines. Nothing looks 
festive out there ... 

686 
than serpentines. I love it. 

687 
And then some more bags with goodies for 
if your guests leave. 

688 
It is a nice, simple way to 
to say 'thank you for coming. " 

689 
Splork, grab a pen. 

690 
Maybe we have luck, and devour 
that our beast meat only with his eyes. 

691 
We must find the exit. 

692 
This way. It's too narrow for him 
to come. 

693 
Faster. He pulls us. 

694 
It runs dead. 
No. 

695 
Kilowatt, put yourself out. 
Can not be afraid. 

696 
If we are not true, we are dead. 

697 
That does not help. 
Here is a trick. 

698 
For your fear of restraint shall set you 
than where you are most afraid of. 

699 
And then imagine that you talk about wins. 

700 
Ham, it breaks loose. 
Come on. You can do it, Kilowatt. 

701 
Be brave. 

702 
Keep your fear under control. 

703 
Keep your fear under control. 

704 
It works. 

705 
The output. 

706 
Let's go. 

707 
It blocks the exit. 
We are in the fall. 

708 
I'm afraid my whole life ... 

709 
but you have shown me 
how I could get it under control. 

710 
Kilowatt, no. What are you doing? 

711 
What I should do. 

712 
If you devour me, I will only 
even stronger. 

713 
Kilowatt, no. 

714 
Why did she do that? 

715 
So stupid, and brave. 

716 
That was the most brave 
that I have ever seen. 

717 
Where are we? 

718 
This should be the dark cloud 
of 'It' are. 

719 
I feel weird and depressed by it. 

720 
I would not even be here. 

721 
I'm just a lousy circus monkey. 
How do you feel there? 

722 
If a stupid animal trick. 
I'm just that. 

723 
A joke. I can replace 
by a cannon ball. 

724 
Crying and crying. 
They are trapped without oxygen. 

725 
Come on guy, we need their 
try to achieve. 

726 
I'm almost there. 

727 
I'm not even a good chimpanzee. 
I have not even once Houston thanks. 

728 
He is like a father to me. 

729 
I have my whole life in the shadow 
my famous grandfather lived. 

730 
How do you feel there? 

731 
You know how it is to 
the shadow to life? It is cold. 

732 
I knew I could never be a hero, 
So I was a clown. 

733 
I think you are broken through. 
I'm afraid that your time runs out. 

734 
There he goes then. With so much power 
told us they certainly did. 

735 
Dear Lord. 

736 
That there, that was just 
that cloud that was talking. 

737 
It is good. Sometimes a conflict between 
a super ego, and an 'It' ... 

738 
cast a long shadow 
in a soul. 

739 
I have no idea what you just said. 
I now walk this way. 

740 
Pathetic slaves of Malgore. 

741 
Welcome to the 'triple Sunday. " 

742 
Soon the sun will be on one line, 
and the volcano will explode ... 

743 
and a lot of you will 
not more than life. 

744 
That's your sign. 

745 
Now we do the party on my way. 

746 
Dance or you're thrown in there. 

747 
You. - Who? 

748 
You do not dance. 
That I did. 

749 
No, that is more shuffle. 
This is dancing. 

750 
Shuffle. 
Dancing. 

751 
Shuffle. 
Well, shuffle. 

752 
This is the third largest 
bad that I have ever seen. 

753 
And I've seen two. 

754 
That is the ship. 
And there is the satellite. 

755 
Now it is my pleasure to 
the main atraktie to present ... 

756 
the monkey that has me the way out. 

757 
Here is Titan. 

758 
And he sleeps not. 

759 
If we had our missile deal, 
Titan, we could save. 

760 
Think you what I think? 
We are not paid to think ... 

761 
we are not even paid. 
Think about it but once. 

762 
Wait. Chimpanzees have chimpanzees 
not behind. 

763 
Luna, I hear you. 
But I have to say. 

764 
We leave him here. 

765 
Well, we saved him. 

766 
Let it slowly discarding mechanism 
begin. 

767 
Zartig, now that I have you get to know you 
seems to me a reasonable alien ... 

768 
Therefore I offer you 
a pardon agreement. 

769 
No. 
Let's go. 

770 
Here we go, ladies. 

771 
Go ahead. Throw me. But then you 
never learn how to use the 3D Radar. 

772 
The 3D Radar? 
That's right. The 3D Radar. 

773 
Luna, follow me. 
Roger. 

774 
Who is Roger? 
Is it serious? 

775 
Tell me, please. 

776 
Turn the star. Not too far, 
Radar to start. 

777 
You take the left, 
I take the right. 

778 
Alarm. Incoming chimpanzees. 

779 
But fire. 

780 
Luna, fun. 

781 
Let's go to the ship, 
so I can save you ... 

782 
and make sure we come home. 

783 
Where are the chimps go afterwards? 
They have escaped. 

784 
Traitor. 

785 
Commander, the launch control 
not responding. 

786 
Check the diagnosis. 

787 
Nothing other than bells and whistles. 

788 
Why teach us all these things ... 

789 
as the steering 
not even connected. 

790 
I've already told you that this 
is all fake. 

791 
They wanted to know if our brains were working 
after we had gone through a wormhole. 

792 
We are canned ham. 
And we could not even open the can. 

793 
Sorry, Luna. But we have nothing else 
than guinea pigs. 

794 
Actually, the guinea pigs 
on a mission to Mars. 

795 
The ship has all the time 
flown on automatic pilot. 

796 
We do not really self-governed. 
We were not real astronauts. 

797 
You have all the time right. 
I did not want to have equal ... 

798 
that the way people think about us. 
That is not how we should think. 

799 
Why am I not born as a rabbit? 
Or a squirrel? 

800 
Or a major in 
art? 

801 
Nobody expects big things from them. 

802 
Another three minutes before takeoff. 

803 
We are at least safe and going home. 

804 
1600 "crunches" per day, 
five hundred times with each arm printing ... 

805 
I can not go. 
What? 

806 
I know that we 'Probe' not 
built, but he came from the earth. 

807 
We have this to. 
I can not run away. 

808 
We owe it to be due Kilowatts 
and to this planet. 

809 
I have an oath, that I think this ship 
would bring to earth. 

810 
And that, I do. 

811 
Ham is right. 

812 
I prefer a hero here on Malgor, 
than a chimpanzee space on earth. 

813 
Lieutenant Luna, this is an order. 

814 
There goes our ride. 
And Titan. 

815 
Commander. 
And your oath then. 

816 
Chimpanzees do not chimpanzees behind. 

817 
You sir will make me cry. 

818 
Ham, we have a plan. 
The commander of the mission consider a plan. 

819 
And your plan is? 

820 
Yes of course, the plan. 

821 
I am the commander of the plan, 
any plan whatsoever. It is my plan. 

822 
It is not your plan ... 

823 
Time to celebrate. 

824 
Horizon returns. 

825 
We have contact. 
The ship has come through the wormhole. 

826 
The landing is about fifteen seconds. 

827 
Here we go. History in the making. 
Turning to those cameras. 

828 
What ... 

829 
I'm afraid that the chimpanzees 
it does not have. 

830 
Do you? 
That's enough. 

831 
The mission has been canceled. 
The space program has ended. 

832 
They remain stuck. 

833 
From tomorrow this whole agency ... 

834 
be converted into something useful ... 

835 
one of those places where your own 
signs designs, beschildert and bakes. 

836 
He has a point. 
That is useful. 

837 
And those two chimpanzees than 
who are still here? 

838 
Two chimpanzees, two words: 
'animals'. 

839 
We need to control the center. 
We are their only chance. 

840 
Follow me. 
Hold on. 

841 
For a chimpanzee from the twentieth century ... 

842 
you move very quickly 
to the twenty-first century. 

843 
Then maybe I'm old, 
but I'm aerodynamic. 

844 
You need to keep me, son. 

845 
Great plan. 

846 
Get ready to finally discarded 
to be. 

847 
Lieutenant Luna? 
Yes, commander. 

848 
You had to plan Ham have questions. 

849 
Three chimpanzees, three codes. 
Who goes there first. 

850 
Are you? 

851 
The size. 

852 
Or are you? Those adorable. 

853 
Or all three at the same time? 

854 
As a commander I can at least 
for sure ... 

855 
that those bombs gym slip here 
you do not jump to throw. 

856 
How would you do that? 

857 
Because I you the secret of the 'Roover' are 
universal domination will learn. 

858 
The whole universe? 

859 
It is big, right? 

860 
But first let go of my crew. 

861 
What? 
Tell me. 

862 
What does he. 
Tell me, please. 

863 
Then I let you live. 

864 
In order to dominate the universe, press 
first on the yellow button. 

865 
Turn the blue button, 
and then the green. 

866 
And move the lever into reverse. 

867 
This one? 
That's right. 

868 
You guys are really stupid. 
Yes. 

869 
And a very bad poet. 

870 
I said 'backwards'? 

871 
That was a joke. 

872 
Kilowatt, you alive. 
But how? 

873 
We saw that the flesh-consuming beast 
you swallowed by. 

874 
He was not yet begun to chew. 

875 
How did you come from there? 

876 
Let me not go back. 

877 
What? 
Have you made a grab? 

878 
Someone wants the statue of Zartog? 
I take it. 

879 
You have freed us from 
the tires of slavery. 

880 
We are eternally grateful to you. 
We are you owed our lives. 

881 
We have come. 
We have crashed. 

882 
We got him a kick up 
given his ass. 

883 
What? Why had his ass do that? 

884 
That is a saying. That is that. 
That is not how it goes. 

885 
I'm 99.9% sure that 
it goes. 

886 
You show your love earth 
in a weird way. 

887 
Luna, can you hear me? 

888 
Luna, is that a banana in your pocket? 

889 
Would you develop? 

890 
Comet? Thank God. 

891 
You will never believe what happened. 
We have all heard. 

892 
We have heard you the whole time. 
The whole time? 

893 
Yes, all the time, son. 

894 
I am sorry that I have so called 
that your legacy would comply. 

895 
It is good, Houston. 
Maybe it's time that I do. 

896 
What is your status? 
Unmarried. 

897 
But there is someone I 
my view to have been dropped. 

898 
It is Luna. 
In the event that you you wonder. 

899 
We discussed the status of the mission? 
Yes. 

900 
Everything is good, but we have nothing 
where we can leave. 

901 
You have the 'Probe' still? 
The 'Probe'? 

902 
That is not designed for it 
back to earth to go. 

903 
We should just 'chimproviseren. " 

904 
I got your stupid word games 
a little missed - Thank you. 

905 
Titan is right. 
You have a whole new design is needed. 

906 
How do we do that? 

907 
I give you as Comet. 

908 
When we first need the aerodynamic 
skeletal structure redesign. 

909 
Understood. Let me give you just Luna. 

910 
Go ahead, Comet. 
Secondly, you need coolant. 

911 
We have at least 7.7 million pounds 
coolant needed ... 

912 
to ensure that we escape 
from the gravity of the planet. 

913 
That never succeed without a 
two-stage rocket. 

914 
We can not do. 

915 
Even if we could build a ship, 
it would never get rid of this planet. 

916 
If you are a chimpanzee from a cannon may 
shoot ... 

917 
you can also a chimpanzee 
shoot from a volcano. 

918 
Of course. Geothermal energy. 

919 
We do not have much time. 

920 
Kilowatt, we will need some help 
if we ever want to come home. 

921 
Malgor planet at your service. 
Let's ride 'chimp. " 

922 
I know I have the pun 
missed, but that was not acceptable. 

923 
I am ready and waiting for instructions. 
I need water tape. Now. 

924 
There, that's right. 

925 
We must go quickly. 

926 
Kilowatt, we will never forget you. 
I never you. 

927 
They will no beauty contest 
win, but they will fly. 

928 
Probably. - Maybe. 
Hopefully. 

929 
Let's not be too much 
analyze. 

930 
The sun in a row, you should hurry. 
The volcano will erupt. 

931 
And then the new entrance? 

932 
You have a nose cone needed. 
Nose Cone? 

933 
No time. How should we 
build a nose cone? 

934 
Control center, the Infinity 
will launch. 

935 
Five seconds. 
I can not see. 

936 
It is louder than a gun. 
I think I become sick. 

937 
We have the Fresnar stopped. 

938 
Time to go home. 

939 
Goodbye. 

940 
I can already see the headlines: 
'Commander Titan returns to earth. " 

941 
What will I wear? 
What fits on confetti? 

942 
We are approaching the entrance of the wormhole. 
Here it comes. 

943 
Take this. 
But I do not know how. 

944 
If we need you fainting 
our home. 

945 
Are you crazy? 
I'm no astronaut. 

946 
Wear clothing you astronauts? 
Yes. 

947 
Are you in a missile? 
Yes. 

948 
In space? 
Yes. 

949 
Are you David Bowie? 
No. 

950 
Then you are an astronaut. 

951 
Bring the bird home, smart guy. 

952 
I'm not here for. 

953 
I believe in you. 

954 
Luna Wait, no. 

955 
Believe in yourself, Ham. 

956 
Grandpa Ham, I can not do this. 
I'm not you. 

957 
Of course you are not me. 
You are yourself. You can do things, son. 

958 
Put them on your way. 

959 
That they are. They are from the wormhole. 

960 
Infinity, welcome back. 
Ham, you receive me? 

961 
The children were sleeping. 

962 
Ham, you should straighten your ship 
to come. 

963 
You come too fast inside. You must 
adjust your angle of 33 degrees. 

964 
Exactly 33 degrees. 

965 
Just a bit. 
Or precisely, exactly? 

966 
Exactly, exactly. If you input 
not touched, you will be space dust. 

967 
Activate the electrical power. 
Checked. 

968 
Put the 'turbulence impetus' to. 
Checked. 

969 
Set off the heat reflectors. 
And the move to gyroscopische stabilatoren. 

970 
I can not here. 

971 
Ham, you are going to run. 

972 
Completely lost control. 

973 
Do you need a copilot? 
Lieutenant Luna. 

974 
Which I certainly needed. 

975 
Control Center, we appreciate 
our angle of 33 degrees at. 

976 
Yes. 
Good grace. 

977 
We have done it. 
Gordo, we can see it. 

978 
And Commander Coma, we will 
make him awake? 

979 
We have no third wheel 
We need a date. 

980 
Luna, leave the landing gear down. 
Checked. 

981 
Houston, our landing gear is broken. 

982 
I picked a bad week, 
to stop eating bananas. 

983 
And now? 
Do not worry, son. 

984 
Low technology solutions 
are my specialty. 

985 
Ham, you remember the circus? 

986 
Well. You will crash. 
Are we going to crash? 

987 
But this time directed you to your goal. 
Roger, Houston. 

988 
Why you laugh, if we go crash? 

989 
Because crash which is 
what the best I can. 

990 
Come out with your feet up. 

991 
Legs? They are chimpanzees. 
They have hands. 

992 
With a thumb like a claw. 
Come out with your thumbs up. 

993 
They mean no English. 

994 
Trap it. 

995 
My Wig. 
That we all knew. 

996 
Everyone knew it. 

997 
Everyone knew it, when you did not swim 
at the party office. 

998 
We go. 

999 
What was that? 

1000 
I can not keep. 
We have lost the steering. 

1001 
Link. 

1002 
I said, 'link'. 
You got it. 

1003 
I had never thought that I would say, 
but you leave the ship crash. 

1004 
What you gonna do? 
No Luna, do not. 

1005 
I see you on the ground. 

1006 
Now we have closed the chapter, 
about space travel ... 

1007 
we have opened a new chapter in 
the history of your own sign painting. 

1008 
Just a little further. 

1009 
You've done it. 
I got him back under control. 

1010 
The national space program 
is here to ... 

1011 
Luna, get up. 
Everything is good with you? 

1012 
This can not happen. 
Come on, Luna. 

1013 
I was this time focused on the goal. 

1014 
I tried to get more 
you seem to. 

1015 
You always had ... 

1016 
Right? 
Yes, and you made me me ... 

1017 
Feel better? 
Yes. 

1018 
And if I should carry on without you ... 

1019 
That you do not. 

1020 
How did you survive? 

1021 
Chin down. 
Thumb as a claw, inside. 

1022 
Lieutenant Luna, you're in style 
crashed. 

1023 
Cannon ball, I was wrong about you. 

1024 
You would have made your grandfather proud. 

1025 
Thank you. I think I have a chimpanzee 
'm from the old sex. 

1026 
That is a good one. 
That should I even use it. 

1027 
You've done that countries well. 
I knew you had it in you. 

1028 
What can I say, 
I am a doordouwer. 

1029 
Official Area Commander sunglasses. 

1030 
And here is your banana phone back. 

1031 
It was almost as good as 
that you had been with us. 

1032 
The Infinity? 

1033 
How? 
Impossible. 

1034 
This ship was not designed 
to return. 

1035 
It is not even a ship. 
It is a miracle. 

1036 
A major scientific achievement. 

1037 
But who has built it? 

1038 
We should perhaps I.Q. 
re-testing of the chimpanzees. 

1039 
Would you say that the chimpanzees 
have built this ship? 

1040 
We may never know 
who has built this ... 

1041 
but they are brought home. 

1042 
Senator. 

1043 
Would you close the space agency? 

1044 
I ... 

1045 
I want to announce the opening of 
a highly technical area ... 

1046 
dedicated to the research 
of space. 

1047 
With first class facilities for 
chimpanzees, and ... 

1048 
and a do-it-yourself 'sunday bar. " 

1049 
And personal 'zakbeschermers' 
for everyone. 

1050 
Do chimpanzees 
extraterrestrial life meet? 

1051 
We will have another mission 
be sure to get to know. 

1052 
Ready, Luna? 
Ready, Captain. 

1053 
Big Boy? 
Ready-born pill. 

1054 
Confetti, I love it. 

1055
