[ orchestra playing
over headphones ]

Oh, look. Look at
that girl jump-roping.

[ mouthing words ]

[ laughter ]

Okay. All right.
Come on. Stop.

Please.

Now let's get her
some food.

No.

Stop.

[ orchestra music continues ]

[ music stops ]
Oh, God!

Emily, oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

Are you okay?

[ wincing ] Uh-huh.

Y-You're gonna be able
to compete today, right?

Mm-hmm.
I'm fine.

Are you sure?

I--

No, really.
It's okay.

Okay. Um...
See?

[ muted orchestra music
resumes ]

Uh, I was gonna
ask you, um,

if I could get
an interview with the--
the school's best jumper?

Uh, sure.

I just don't know
if I look okay.

You look awesome.

Uh--Heh heh.

I mean--I mean great.
Uh, awesome.

Heh.

Okay, well, um, yeah,
are--are you ready?

'Cause--
Yeah.

Could you just
move over a little bit?

Just right--
Okay, just right there.
right there.

Okay, Emily, um,

why do you jump?

[ cheering ]

Go, go! Fire it up!
Go, go! Fire it up!

[ cheering ]
Go, Logan!

ANNOUNCER: Judges ready?

Jumpers ready.

Set. Go.

â™ª He wants to live inside
a tree he can sleep on â™ª

â™ª To hold him up while
everyone washes away â™ª

â™ª Only there, could he
get things completed â™ª

â™ª Only there, would
the distractions go away â™ª

â™ª They would set it up

â™ª So they would
always keep moving â™ª

â™ª Till they'd had enough
and things got stale... â™ª

ANNOUNCER: Give it up for 'em,
ladies and gentleman,

the last group
of double Dutch,
singles freestyle,

Watch 'em work.

â™ª Looking everywhere

â™ª It all seems better

â™ª Falling in
a trap of mirrors â™ª

[ cheering ]

Females 15 to 17,
single rope, speed,

please report
to your stations. Thank you.

Hi. And your name is?

Emily Smith-Dungy.
Great.

Emily, I'd like you
to notice the four
corners of this square

and make sure you
stay within its bounds.

ANNOUNCER:
Single rope, speed.

Judges ready?
[ classical music playing ]

Jumpers ready.

Set. Go.

And the runner-up
is Tracy Hill!

[ cheering ]

All right, Tracy.
Good work.

And the winner
in this year's Macomb County

regional competition is...

with a staggering
new regional record
of 465 jumps--

that's 2.58 jumps
per second, folks--

Miss Emily Smith-Dungy!

[ cheering ]

Yeah, Emily!

Emily and Tracy
will represent the county

in the state finals
this Sunday at 10 A.M.,

and you won't want
to miss that, folks.

Give it up
for the ladies!

Whoo!

Great job.

[ cheering ]

[ overlapping chatter ]

[ camera snapping ]

MAN: Good. One more.

All right.

That was
really good.

Uh, hey. Hey, Em.

Uh, congrats on--
on today.

Yeah, I thought
you were really...

Thanks, Chris.

Hey, Emily,
great job today.

You're awesome.

[ car radio playing music ]

[ grunting ]

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah
[ laughs ]

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah...

I know a purse that
thinks it's hot shit.

Want to beat the crap
out of it, too?

Look, I don't love the idea
of giving you a ride,

but I'm thinking maybe it'll
balance out the bad karma

for the pack of Twizzlers
I just stole.

Ooh, that disapproving glare
of Emily Smith-Dungy.

Hmph.

Okay. Well, suit yourself.

â™ª You're living in a lie

â™ª You ain't nothing
but a BFI... â™ª

Wait! Wait!

â™ª 'Cause you ain't no one

â™ª You're living in a lie

â™ª You ain't
nothing but a BFI â™ª

You know, it doesn't
exactly raise
my street cred

to be seen
with a jumptard.

Hey, hey. Oh!
Hold on!

I told you
she is particular.

I can think
of several
other adjectives

that are
a little bit
more accurate--

rickety, decrepit,
pathetic.

Bitchy?
What?

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
You were talking about the car.

F off.

That is going to sting
all the way home.

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª Yeah, yeah--

Nyaah!

You a cop?

If you ain't a cop,

my pimp is
gonna fix you up,

bustin' in
like that.

I'm not in the mood.

Then what good
are ya?

If you don't
want to make it,

then let me alone
so I can get stoned.

Lucy, what did I tell you
about matches?

It's Iris!
<i>Taxi Driver?</i>

Don't tell me
you've never seen it.

Classic Scorsese.

It's about a mentally
imbalanced Vietnam vet

and a teenage
prostitute. That's me.

It's a good character,
shows my range.

Yeah, well, directors
don't want to see
9-year-old prostitutes

when they're casting
for Toasty O's.

[ sighs ]
Come on, mister.

You're starting
to be a real drag.

Lucy.

Are you an Aries?
Lucy.

Pisces make
the best lovers,
you know.

Iris.

Where's Dad?

'Kay.

[ drums playing ]

[ Native American chanting ]

[ knock on door ]

[ knock on door ]
Dad!

[ gasps ]

Dad, I need
to talk to you.

[ knock on door ]

[ turns off music ]
Emily.

How many times
have I told you

that when I'm
here working,

I am surrounded by
a creative membrane?

And nothing
comes in.

Nothing escapes
creative membrane.

Mm-hmm,
membranes are permeable.

What you want is a wall.

I don't ask for much
from this family,

a simple respect
for my process.

Mm-hmm.
Where were you at 3:30?

Where was I at 3:30?

In some fantastically
transcended zone.

My body
was like the conduit
for a higher energy.

I am completing
what might be

the most important piece
of my entire career.

No, no. No. [ laughs ]

Not yet. Don't--
Don't touch it.

I just wanted to see
what was so important
that you couldn't--

It's not ready
for judgment.

Okay, that's great,

but where should you
have been at 3:30?

You sound
like your mother,

consumed with time
and a schedule.

Do not tread
that path.

Remember. Remember,
it's what we do,

not when we do it.

It's the what
that's important.

This is important.

This...

this was important, too.

What's this?

You didn't even read it.

What is this, a note?

Regionals?

[ dance music playing ]

Where were you at 3:30?!

3:30?
Yeah, 3:30.

It usually it occurs
between 3:00 and 4:00.

Oh! I was editing
this new piece.

Check it out!

[ music stops ]

Hello. Welcome. Bawwk!

May I take your order?

Chicken nuggets!
Bawwk!

Man has processed
his relationship with nature

into bite-size pieces.
You feel me?

Bawwk!

No.
Hmm.

Maybe I should add
some more nuggets.

Yeah, more nuggets to that.
What do you think?

You think it's ready
to show Dad?

I don't care.
Bawwk!

Well, maybe I'll
hold off on the nuggets

and just see
what Dad thinks.

I mean, he always knows how
to cut through the bullshit

and right to the core
of the piece, you know?

Oh. You know
what you should do?

What?

Actually show up
to something

when you say
you will.

What the hell?

You look like
a raging homosexual.

I am a raging homosexual.

Mom?

Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah.

Because it's men
21 to 55, that's why.

I want to see
power tools,
jackhammers,

nail guns, all that crap
that makes men feel

like they're wielding
a substantial tool
for once.

Yes, all men think
like that, Rick.
Mom.

Just have it
on my desk Monday.

Yes, sexy drills.
It always comes back

to sex with this demo.
Mom.

Don't worry about Hoverman.
He'll pitch humor.

He always pitches humor.
I'm on the phone.

Look, it boils down
to this, Rick.

Do you want to laugh,
or do you want to screw?

Did you forget
something today?

That wasn't a proposition,
sweetie.

Something important?

Look I will be VP by March,

and I do play favorites

[ grunts ]
What? What?

Maybe something
at the precise time
of 3:30 postmeridian?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my--Ohh.

Rick, those J&J mock-ups
were supposed to go to Tokyo

this afternoon at 3:30.

You did?

He did? You did?

On you are
a goddamn stallion.

I'm gonna ride you
all the way to the top.

No, let him pitch humor.

I'd like to see him
juggle his balls
in the air.

No! Are you kidding?

He's such a jerk.
[ laughs ]

Sure. Sound
like a horse.

[ woman vocalizes ]

â™ª We thank you, food

â™ª The food

â™ª That nourishes our soul

[ vocalizing ]

[ stops singing ]

Nobody showed up.

Oh, sweetheart, I know.
I'm so sorry.

I desperately tried
to get there,

but Mickey
was having a bad day,
and your father was just--

MRS. SMITH-DUNGY: GG!

Oh, no.

My God, how many
times do I--GG?

Can you stir that
for me, please?

Need to speak with you.

Um, what part
of dry cleaning do
you not understand?

The chemical part.

Dry cleaning
releases

toxic chemicals
into our waters.

I don't care.
I--

I don't care.

This little blouse
cost me $300.

Excuse me. Could you
please take this
argument someplace else?

Thank you.

Don't you raise
your voice to me,
sugarplum.

I'm not your maid.

Oh, I know.
If you were my maid,

I would have fired you
years ago.

Sam!
[ doorbell rings ]

I'll get it!

Oh, your energy
is so negative,

I have to burn
sage every time
I come here.

Oh, is that
what that smell is?

'Cause I thought the forest
came into my office
and took a crap.

It's so telling that you
would object to sage,

the cleaning
agent provided
by Mother Earth.

Well my mother's name
is Janice, not Earth,

so if you could keep
your flaming shrubs
out of my office,

I'd deeply
appreciate it.

So you ever
been to Fillmore?

Uh...

Back before '70,
it was fantastic.

Me and
my girlfriend Anne

used to get stoned
out of our brains

and check out
all the great bands.

You ever
see CCR on LSD?

Janice must be so proud,

the wonderful mother
you've become.

Ma!
Are you kidding?

You're judging me?

You take that finger
and turn around

and point it
right at yourself.

There's your legacy.
You proud of that?

[ mouths word ]

I don't want her
here anymore.

She takes very good care
of our children.

She feeds them
nice organic,
vegetarian meals...

Well, I--I don't care.
Sam, you're not willing

or prepared to make!

Take your sage and--

Guess what.
I'm out of here.

No! Ma, wait!

I'm leaving.

Ma! Mama?

Mama?!

[ arguing continues ]

So, we gonna do it,
or what?

Do what?

And scene.

Hey.

Hi, Chris.

How are you?

Um, okay.

Uh...
I'm walking out that door.

You know,
right now is not
a very good time.

Oh, yeah. I can--Okay.

Well, look, I--
I only came by

'cause I have
this DVD of you
at the quarterfinals...

Come on!
and I just...

Wait! Mom!

No! No, let me go!
Ma! Ma!

Oh. Who do
we have here?

I don't want to be
around that women
ever again!

She's the devil.
No!

Oh, hey.
Uh, yeah, I'm Chris.

Look, I--I just came by
'cause I wanted

to give this to Emily.
That's all.

A gift?
Oh, Duncan,

he brought her
a gift.

You're a good boy.
Thanks.

Tell me, how long
were you breast-fed
as a child?

Mom.
Uh...

Were you on the tit
till you were
practically driving?

I'm sorry.

There's nothing
more nutritious

than mother's milk.

It's nature's
protein shake.

Chris?
Yeah?

Yeah. So...

you dating
my daughter? Hmm?

Tell me...
I don't...

are you one
of those A & O guys?

Dad!

Sir?

You know,
one of those cool cats

who tell their girlfriends
that anal and oral
isn't real sex

so they can protect
their virginity?

Okay!

Time to go.
It's time to go, Dad.

No.
Dad, no.

What about condoms?
What about 'em?

It's never too early
to start talking
about condoms!

That's enough, Dad!

You know what
I'm talking about.

Sir, I don't think--

You know what
I'm talking about

Dad, that's enough.

I'm gonna go, okay?

Okay, sounds good.
Okay.

Oh, wait! Wait!
Em, I'm sorry.

Ah, God, this DVD.
I just wanted to--

Okay, just take it, okay?
Thanks.

Bye.
Okay, bye.

Bye-bye.

[ birds squawking ]

[ rope whipping ]

[ breathing heavily ]

[ grunting ]

SAM: I'd take his balls
and wrap 'em around
his neck. Hah!

[ snoring ]

Statistically speaking,
I think parents

kill more teens
than drugs or even cars.

If we don't
end up punching out
our own tickets,

we just suffer through
years of therapy,

only to realize
that our parents
were completely inept

and that we are now
equally inept parents

...and loud,
the Tasmanian devils

can have up
to four pups
at a time...

Well, I refuse to partake
in this farce.

The animal will
defend itself
if provoked.

I should just down a bottle
of Mom's sleeping pills

and get it over with.

Bet they wouldn't
even notice or care.

Do you think they would?

Most saltwater fish
can survive

in a tank filled
with human blood.

[ sighs ]

Mom wouldn't.

Maybe Dad...

for a day or so.

At least
Grandma Gail would.

COMPUTER:
The animal will continue
to spread its disease.

In captivity,
a scientist hopes

the devils can
be rehabilitated,

but first they
must be tranquilized
and restrained.

BROTHER: Where--Where
the hell's the food?

LUCY:
Gotta be here somewhere.

Can smell it.

Is this a joke?

In here!

What's the occasion?

Just trying
something new.
Come sit.

So not funny.
Hold, please.

What the--

Someone kidnapped
my dinner.

I know.
That's what I said.

Hang on. What the--

I don't understand.

Lucy, can you
hand me my plate?

We are having dinner
as a family.

Rick, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

No, it's dinner
as a family.

Whoo!
I know. It's--

I haven't
done it in, like--

They're staring at me.
I've gotta go. Bye.

Okay, let's go.
I'm gonna--

Do you mind
sitting down first?

Mm-hmm.

Strange child.

Thank you
for joining us, Dad.

Was I late? [ chuckles ]

Shouldn't I be
sitting here?

SAM: Hah!

I'm hosting
this dinner.
please sit down.

Mom, phone.

Just one second.

Mom, phone.

Send.

So I'm sure
you're all wondering

what we're doing here.

Not at all.

Historically families
have had meals together.

The mother cooks.

The children gather.

Everyone eats and enjoys.

Is the mother
the sole breadwinner

with Monday deadlines
historically?

I support
what Emily is doing.

Now lets all join hands
and say a little prayer.

What do they say?

A family that prays
together stays together

Mom.
You must be joking.

Not in the least.

<i>Taxi Driver?</i>

Sure as shit.

[ laughs ]
Fantastic.

Lord Shiva,
Bless this family,

and may your third eye
look down upon us with
love and kindness.

Amen.
Amen.
Amen.

Since when
are we Hindu?

How do we know
which God is the one
true God, hmm?

Just 'cause you're born
in a specific region
of the planet

doesn't make your God
better than someone else's.

I say we pray to them all
just to be fair.

So, as I was saying--

Oh, I have
an announcement.

From now on,
I want to be called Thor.

Hmm. Thor, okay.
Thor?

Like the comic book?

No, the Norse God
of thunder,

I was gonna go
with Poseidon, but Thor
just hits, you know.

Doesn't Thor,
like, have a, like,
hammer or something?

Yeah, he does.
Totally fits you.

It's badass.
Badass, man.

Isn't Thor
kind of butch?

No.

We named you after
Jackson Pollock,

one of
my early influences.

Paint-splattering hack.

Anyway--

I thought
you liked Pollock.

You found
his work sensual.

Sensual.
That was a long time ago.

Paints don't really
get me off anymore.

No one needs
to know that, Mom.
What does that mean?

Well, do I have
to explain it to you?

It's really
not that difficult.

Thor.
Does that mean that

you don't find my work
sensual anymore?

Sensual.
Thor.

What's your work look like?
I haven't seen one of them
finished in five years.

Yeah, I think
I still like it.
Sensual!

Painting is
a process.
You can finish a process.

It's not like
baking a pie.

Thor. Thor. Thor.
I don't cook.

So it's not a problem.
Aah! Cramp. Cramp.

Walk it off.
walk it off.

When a horned toad
gets angry,

it squirts blood
out of its eyes.

Sensual.
Charley horse balm.

Anyone got
any Tiger Balm?

Painting
is a process.

â™ª Sensual...

Don't just pop 'em
in the oven,

and, ding, they're done.
Well, I'm done...

A horned toad
is actually a lizard.

with this whole...
Sensual.

family dinner thing
Aah!

What is wrong
with you people?!

Can we be normal
one GD day

out my entire
GD life?

Hey, what's with
all the GDs today?

It means "God damn."
I know what it means.

I competed
in the state
regionals today,

and no one
showed up.

Oh, that
jump-roping thing.

Oh, wow.
Was that today?

I left GD notes around
the entire GD house.

There it is again.

That's what that little
yellow Post-it was.

You both said
you'd be there.

No, I said
I had a meeting,

that I couldn't come.

And if I said
I was gonna come,

you know I'd
be there, baby.

Okay. Mickey.

No, Mickey, don't.

No, Mickey.
Mickey, don't, please.

Mickey, no. Shh.
Mm-hmm.

January 15,
7:32 P.M. Eastern
Standard Time.

Emily--
"It's at 3:30.
You'll be there?"

Dad--"3:30. Okay."
Mom--"Yes, yes,
I'll be there."

Emily--"Okay,
because you missed
the district finals."

Mom--"I also missed
my 20s pregnant with
you and your brother."

Okay, that's enough.
[ laughs ]

Emily, look,
I don't understand
what the big deal is,

okay, this jumping rope.

What's next, the Olympic
jumping jacks team?

Maybe you can
get gold in the
freestyle dorking.

Shut up, Jacks.

It's Thor.
Shut up.

This was important
to me.

Emily, you know
I don't approve
of competitive sports.

It teaches people
a value system
where one person

is better than another
just because of their
genetic inheritance,

because of their
physical attributes.

That's what Hitler
used to teach.

Sensual.
Are you comparing

jumping rope
to the Holocaust?

[ Jackson laughs ]

No. No, I'm just--

I don't know where you get
this competitive spirit.

It must come from
your mother's side.

I think competitive spirit
is good,

and pouring yourself
into something

that really
doesn't matter is not.

That must come
from your father's side.

I forgot the wine.

Are you saying
you'd like to live in
a world without art?

Without Julian Schnabel,

Francesco Clemente,
Jean-Michel Basquiat?

Warhol, Banksy?

Well, I doubt the world
would spin off its axis.

It just might.

As today's winner,

I am now qualified

for the state
championships
this Sunday.

Ooh.

And I would
very much appreciate it

if all of you came.

Nope.

I so wish I could,
but I have

a huge presentation
on Monday.

I'm sorry, baby.

I gotta finish a painting
this weekend.

[ snickers ]

It's what I imagined.

Okay, a toast
to a productive weekend.

Cheers.

Cheers.
Hear, hear.
Salute.

It's not your fault.

It's a type
of sickness.

[ burps ]

Kind of like
the facial cancer
of the Tasmanian devil.

Tasmanian devil.

Emily, I--Ha.

I--I don't know
what's getting into you,

but I-I'm--I like--

The cancer
must be stopped.

Are you sure
they're even okay?

25 milligrams of Ziposal
is a nonlethal dosage.

Where'd you get Zipos--
Mom's cabinet.

Will you hand me
that tape?

No way.
When the police ask,

I never
saw anything.

Jacks...

I'm gonna need
your help on this.

I don't even know
what this is.

This is our only chance
to do something
about our family.

[ sighs ]

It didn't used
to be like this.

Don't you remember?

I don't even
remember Tuesday.

You used to float
these little paper boats

with Dad in the lake.

Do you remember that?

But how does this
solve anything?
I mean,

do you even have a plan?

I-I'm working on one.

Well, you might have
wanted to start with that.

I'm sorry, Em,
but there's no way
I'm touching this.

[ rope whipping ]

[ groans ]
What the hell?

The plan. Take a look,
and meet me downstairs.

You're such a hooker.

Is that bacon?

I made plenty.
Come sit down.

Did you look
at section 3C?

Not really.

The blue tab.

"A gripping
documentary."

It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

but if the subject matter
is too raw for you--

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I live raw.

"Resourceful young girl

tries to save
her family from..."

No, it's
a psychological
thriller.

We go inside
the twisted mind
of the psychotic teen.

I don't know
if she's psychotic.

Oh, she's
completely nuts.

We see her inner rage,

her sad
sexual repression.

Sexual?

I'm gonna
make this film.

The world must know
what happened here.

Jacks?

My name is Thor.

JACKSON: And action.

You're documenting,
but I'm in charge,

or the deal is off.

Fine.

What's going on?

Em kidnapped Mom and Dad,

and I'm making
a movie of it. Yeah.

Hah!

A movie?

Yeah.
A movie! Okay.

It's not
a kidnapping.

It's a rehabilitation

Real cutting-edge,
avant-garde stuff.

Psycho daughter
drugs her parents.
Godard meets Michael Moore.

Lucy, there's
a really big role
in this movie for you,

but no matter
what Mom or Dad say,
I'm the director.

Please.

I'm a professional.

Great.

[ narration playing
through headphones ]

All right, everyone,
get ready.

Okay, here we go.

Yaah! [ coughs ]

JACKSON: Yeah, Dad.
That's good.

Why am I tied up?

Are we
being robbed?

Is there
an intruder?

Why am I taped?

This is what
happens when johns
try to skip out

without paying
for the puddin'.

SAM: Lucy,
a little help, please

Sorry, pal.
No can do.

Lucinda, stop messing around.

Jackson, put down
that camera.

Thor.
If this is a joke,

I don't think
its very funny.

EMILY: This is not a joke.
What's that smell?

I did this.
Huh?
What?

Since you're not
willing or capable of
doing it on your own,

I've made it my mission
to make this thing

you call a family
actually resemble
a family again.

Lucy.
I don't under--

DUNCAN: Is that
a tofu sausage?

No, it's not.

It's pig,
and like a normal family,

we started our morning with
a well-balanced breakfast.

It comes
from a living thing.

You don't want
to eat an animal
with a face, do you?

Yes, she does.
Faces, shoulders,
all of that.

Dad, we're part
of the food chain,

the top part.

Is this about meat?

No, its about
being normal.

You do realize the irony
of that statement.

Extreme circumstances
require extreme
measures, Mom.

Oh, you want
to see extreme?

I'll show you extreme.

Extreme
right up those stairs--

All right, All right,
al right. Calm down!

Shit.

I actually think there
might be some merit

to what Emily
is trying to do.

What?!
Excuse me?

All right, I know
I should be angry,

but it kind
of reminds me
of something

I...

might have done
when I was her age.

This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

You have no idea when
to give me parental support

and when to not.

This is a perfect example
of a not.

SAM: Emily,
this is asinine.

I really thought
that you were
much smarter than this.

You, Thor, just because this
was your sister's idea,

doesn't mean
you're off the hook.

Please don't look
directly into the camera.

Really? Wow, I--

Mom, we are so beyond
your guilt trips.

How about being
grounded till you're 18?
How 'bout that?

Fine, if that means
you'll be normal parents.

Normal? [ laughs ]

We are...

galaxies away
from normal,

and at this very moment,
the punishment

will be commensurate
with the crime.

I'm talking
severe lockdown--

no friends,
no extracurriculars,

and certainly
no competitive jump.

Well, that's
a little extreme.

Okay, Duncan.

Everything
you worked for,
down the drain.

It would be
such a shame.

Or...

I can make you
a one-time offer only.

Can't believe
I'm saying this.

Crazy. It's crazy. Ha!

You untie me--
us right now,

and I mean
right this very minute,

I'll forget everything.

No grounding.
No yelling.

Just carry on.

Duncan!

That sounds
reasonable.

As if it never happened

Y-You promise?

Yes. Yes, we--

we promise,
don't we, sweetheart?

JACKSON:
This is good.

No.

No. I don't want
to carry on like this
never happened...

because that's
how we got here.

[ rope whipping ]

First to illustrate both
of your glaring deficiencies
as parents, the facts.

Please feel free
to follow along
in your packets.

As you can see
in chart 1A,

attendance of
children's events
has declined

from its peak of 65%

to its current
flat line of 2%.

[ scoffs ]
In pie chart 3B...

Em, this is
very left-brain.

you can notice
that the portion
labeled quality time

is a very thin line

between watching movies
and self-absorption.

I haven't seen a movie
in three years,

and he's the one at home,
so if I could be released...

Mother, I will
get out the tape.
that would be amazing.

Tape?

Mm-hmm.

Lucy...

can you get
Mommy's BlackBerry?

Lucy, get the tape.

[ muffled speech ]

Let's take a look
at graph 8B.

[ muffled speech ]

Strange that
you're still
attempting to talk.

[ muffled ]
...grade, I smoked
some weed.

[ clunk ]
Susan!

Jackson, got Mom.

Do something with Dad.

What do you want me
to do? I'm filming.

Dad! Jackson,
stop filming, or--

[ muffled scream ]

JACKSON: This is good.

[ muffled scream ]
Help me now!

JACKSON: Yes.

LUCY:
Calm down, Dad.

DUNCAN:
...off of me!

JACKSON: No way.
Oh, this is gonna be good.

[ music playing
over headphones ]

[ muffled screaming ]

LUCY: Help me.

JACKSON: Get out
of the shot.

Lucy, do something.

[ music playing ]

[ woman singing in Korean ]

[ speaking Korean ]

DUNCAN: Untie me.

I won't tell anybody.

I won't tell your sister.
Just untie me.

Lucy.

Lucy.

Lucy.
Stay put.

[ muffled yelling ]

...out of here now,
Emily! Now!

Shh. Quiet

Ohh!

Mm! Susan!

Susan! Susan!

Emily, let me out!

Ehh...

[ speaking Korean ]

[ muffled yelling ]

[ muffled scream ]

[ scream continues ]

[ sobs ]

[ water running ]

[ speaking Korean ]

Does it hurt?

You didn't give me
much of a choice.

DUNCAN: Susan! Susan!

Ahh! Susan!

[ muffled yelling ]

[ yelling stops ]

LUCY: Yo, Susan!

And action.

[ muffled yells ]

You gonna tell me
about the setup?

I'll cut off
your friggin' ear, man

You're gonna die...

What?

like the scum pig
that you are.

You take that off.

[ grunts ]

Stop!

[ yelling ]

[ Jackson laughing ]
Hello?

Anybody there?

That's it! No more!

[ speaking Korean ]

My name is Siu Jin,
not Susan!

[ Jackson laughs ]

Later, Susan.

Susan!

[ muffled yelling ]

End scene.

Awesome.

[ car engine outside ]

Oh, hey, Kat.

What's up?

No wig today?

Your mom's getting away.

[ door closes ]

[ Duncan grunting ]

LUCY: Shh.

<i>Reservoir Dogs?</i>

How do I look?

SAM: Kat.
Oh, thank God. Kat!

[ muffled speech ]

Makeover?
You want a makeover?

Whatever you want.
Kat?

Yeah, you left this
incredibly modest symbol
of achievement in my car.

Look, Kat,

I know things have been
"you know" between us,

but you can't
tell anyone, not yet.

Uh, yeah, but see,

narcing on you
would catapult me
into a serious lead

in our little
neighborhood rivalry,

so, my dear,
you have two choices.

Behind door number one,
we have me dialing 911

as you chase me
around the house
until the police arrive.

You probably
wouldn't like
being incarcerated,

and as you know,
cardio makes my cooch itch,

so that's a lose-lose.

But behind door number 2,

we have a simple
symbiotic transaction.

I believe the going rate
for allowing my archenemy

to get away with
a major felony is...

50 bucks and
a first-row seat.

You're blackmailing me?

No. No, I'm just bored,

and I just
want to be here

when the whole thing
goes shit circus.

LUCY: Em,
Dad needs to pee again.

Mm, you should
probably handle that.

[ rope whipping ]

Ugh. I am not
doing that again.

[ groans ]
Come on, Dad.
We got this.

You're like
a beached whale.

The sooner you cooperate,
the sooner this is over.

[ gasps ]

Emily, come here.
Listen.

The key
to a successful
revolution

is controlled chaos.

Now, you're letting
this get too loose.

Susan saw Lucy
try to cut my ear off,

and now Kat is involved.

Does that--

Emily, kidnapping
is a first-degree
felony.

Yeah.
And I will
prosecute.

That means jail time
and a permanent scar
on your record,

so unless
you want a diploma

from the state
penitentiary--

Well, actually,
you can get

a pretty good degree
in a state penitentiary.

A friend of mine
from high school--

Mom, Dad, focus.

Why don't we go
to the big board, shall we?

Now, I'm gonna ask you some
multiple-choice questions,

and you're gonna
give me answers.

Correct answers
will be awarded.

Like a game show.

Oh, don't encourage her.

Incorrect answers
will be punished.

Japanese game show.
Nice.

When a male friend
of your 16-year-old
daughter comes over,

appropriate topics
of conversation are...

A, weather,
B, sports,

C, school,

D...

anal sex.

I was just trying
to learn something
about your friend.

Please answer
the question.

Safe sex is never

an inappropriate
conversation.

Wrong! A through C

are appropriate topics.

Never, ever, ever,
ever, ever D.

Young people have questions
about intercourse,

all kinds of intercourse,

animal intercourse,

same-sex intercourse,

different-sex intercourse.

Stop saying,
"Intercourse."

Emily, clearly
you have some issues

with inter--

sex.

Wh-Wh--[ gasps ]

Why are you
ripping my skirt
when he screwed up?

It's a team game.
You're partners.

That's Prada.

Now it's nada.

The acceptable age for a child
to use profanity is...

Depending upon
the situation.

Wrong. It is never
appropriate for a child
to use profanity,

especially not
9-year-old girls.

DUNCAN: But Lucy's just
playing make-believe.

Yeah.

She was dressed
like a GD prostitute.

You're not being impartial.

Let's let Kat be
the judge. Kat?

Kat agrees.

Yeah, I don't know.
He has a point.

Everyone swears.
No. I don't.

Really?
Sure you're not just

being a GD
MFing hypocrite?

Can't believe
I'm saying this,

but I'm really
glad you're bringing
this up, Emily.

Your father here
doesn't understand
the appropriate--

Mom, I wouldn't
say that appropriate
is your strong suit.

Excuse me?

Mickey, Tuesday, 7:00ish,

something about nailing?

January 8, 7:15 P.M.

Man--"Don't worry.
I'll nail it."

Mom--"You nail the copy,

and you can nail whatever
you want this weekend."

That was
taken completely
out of context.

Oh, really?
Should we hear the rest?
Yeah.

No.
Fine.

Don't use your brother
as a dictation machine.

Wrong again.

No!
Emily.

That was one
of my early masterpieces.

[ scoffs ]

That is a natural plant
that grows freely
on this Earth.

Mm-hmm.
It's an illegal substance

and a horrible example
for your children.

If you're worried
about your brother's
pot experimentation,

you can relax.

Thor is a very
well-adjusted young man.

Oh, yeah?

Do well-adjusted
young men pretend to be gay?

Enh.
What?

She's just kidding.

Is this true?

No!

Dad, I'm totally gay.

She's just
messing around.

No, I'm not.

This is so crazy.
I'm so queer.

Thor, it's all right
if you're not gay.

Dad, I like dudes. I--

He thinks people will
think he's more artsy
if he's gay.

I love dudes, love 'em.

He doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

It's 'cause good men
are hard to find.

Everybody knows that.
Amen.

He has straight
porn mags in his room.

They're so gross.

Straight porn?

Boobs and everything?

No. Boobs are
so nasty.

I could have told you
years ago he wasn't gay.

You overaccessorize.

No, I don't.

It's okay.

You know what?

Screw this.

Thor.

Lucy, watch them.

Until the age of three,

all male walruses
engage in homosexual
relationships.

Lucy,
come let Mommy out.

Jacks?

What?!

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean
to out you

or in you or whatever.

But you have to admit
it's kind of weird

pretending to be gay.

Hello?

I had one thing
that made me
interesting...

one thing that
made him notice me.

You couldn't let me
have that, could you?

I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.

[ rope whipping ]

[ rope continues whipping ]

Duncan, we need
a new approach.

Just agree with
everything I say.

I can't believe
Thor's not gay.

With you going
on and on about Warhol
all the time,

I'm surprised he hasn't
dyed his hair white.

Oh, so this is my fault?

Yes, of course it is.

You're the one
who's here all the time.

A son pretending
to be gay is something

that usually
the primary-care parent
would pick up on.

A primary-care parent
implies that there's

some kind
of secondary-care parent,

and we both know that's
not the case, don't we?

[ footsteps ]

Emily, hi. [ laughs ]

He's
a little upset,

but he'll
come around.

Yes, he will. Um,

your father and I
have been talking, and,

whew, we need
a new approach. [ laughs ]

We are starting to see
some of your frustrations.

Yes.

Yes. Thank you, Duncan.

I know this sounds crazy,

but I do think--

we both think that...

we could do
a better job at...

parenting this family.

Together,
as partners.

Yes.

Right.
I'm not that stupid.

Mmm. Thank you, honey.

I'd drink more,
but I'd just have
to pee again. Heh.

Emily, darling,
you're right.

I think
it's time that we work
on some of this stuff.

I--I don't know what to do
or what to say,

but I do think it's time
to lose the ropes and--

and work this out
as a family.

You would really
listen to me?

Yeah.

[ doorbell rings ]

Lucy, duct tape!
On it, Em!

Make a gag!
MAN: Hello!

Hello?

Hello!

Hello?
I can't find it!

Where did you put it?!

It's your job.
Please help us!

Help!

Mickey, go get the door.

Go get the door.
[ doorbell rings ]

Does anybody
need help in there?

Hide everything
in this operation.

We've been
taken hostage!

What the F?
Jackson, stop.
Just help me.

And action.

I'm coming in!
Everybody hide!

Yes. Now we
have a movie.

SAM: Kick the door down!
Just kick it in!

MAN: What?!

Ah! I found the tape!
Help!

Lucy.

EMILY: It's too late!
Just hide!

Hurry up,
and get in here!

Stop.

Right there.

The cops. I got
something for 'em.

Bunch of freaking amateurs.
Shh. Thor.

Stop filming.
Ha!

Hello?

Yes! Me! Come!

SAM: Hello?

I'm warning you.
I know tae kwon do.

Rick?

Rick? Who's Rick?
Rick?

Is this why you didn't
show up to our meeting?

Yes! Come here.

Your text message did say

you wanted to close
the deal. Wow. Kinky.

Eww. No, Rick.
Come here. Untie me.

Just so you know,
I'm not super into bondage.

Maybe a little role-playing
here and there,

plushies,
master-slave stuff.

Rick, now!

Who's the dude?

Who am I?

Who the hell are you?

I'm Rick. Who are you?

I live here.
This is my wife

I thought you said
your husband was dead.

You said I was dead?

No, I meant it
metaphorically.

What?
What?

Just come here and
untie us! Please.

Why are you
telling people I'm dead?

Just so you know,
I'm not super into dudes.

Wait a second?

Are you sleeping
with this guy?

I don't think she had
much sleeping in mind, bro.

Raah!
Ohh!

[ screams ]
Oh ho ho!

Yes!

KAT: Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.

Dude, yeah!

[ gasps ]

Nice job, Emily.
Emily.

Lucy, um, I need you
to take Mickey

up to his room
and hang out for a bit.

No way!
This is hard-core.

Now. Lucy, now.

Come on, Mickey.

I got guns.

Heh heh.

Emily.

Okay. [ sighs ]

Tape.

[ laughs ]

Oh. Sorry.

[ rope whipping ]

Shut up, Mom. I have
everything under control.

[ Jackson laughs ]

Thor, get that
out of my face.

Can someone please
give me a hand?

No way.
You're psycho sauce.

I'm more of a star witness
than a codefendant.

It's fine.

Emily,
listen to Mom.

We need to consider

what you're
doing now.

Oh, my G.

I'd go with, "Oh, my F G."

Please tell me
you're getting all this.

Rolling.
Awesome.

How was I supposed to know
that he would show up?

You couldn't plan for this.

I just reacted
to the situation.

[ groans ]

Rick. Rick,
are you okay?

Sam?

What the hell?

Why am I tied up?

Because our daughter
Emily is a bit

dissatisfied with
our parenting style.

What? Dissatisfied?
Are you kidding me?

Sam, are you sleeping
with this guy?

Oh, God, would that
bother you?

Would that pierce
your membrane?

Be quiet!

Somebody needs
to untie me right now.

Rick, do I look
like I have a say
in the matter?

Is this what this
is about, my membrane?

Not now, Duncan.

Okay, clearly
you guys are dealing

with some sort
of family issues.
Uh, Emily--

It's Emily, right?

Yeah, anyway...

Look, I know being
a kid is tough.

I know that's gotta
be hard, especially
with a mom like Sam.

You should have seen her
last week at work.

She made Hoverman cry.

Hoverman's a wussy.

Will you shut up?!
Yeah.

Look, you seem like
you got a good head
on your shoulders.

...kind of illegal.
a little bit.

Is this really worth
40 years in jail?

It wouldn't
be 40 years.

Can't believe you're
sleeping with this guy.

"This guy" headed
multinational campaigns

for six
Fortune 500 companies
last year, asshole.

One more, and I would
have been impressed.

Oh, shut up,
both of you. Emily--

Follow your goals.

Listen to me,
Little Miss Sunshine.

If you don't
let me go right now--

and I mean
right this second,

I will make your life
a living hell.

Do you understand?

And this is serious
right here.

This is a serious crime.

You know,
adultery is a crime.
Yeah!

Actually it's not.

Uh, yeah, it is,
for a family.

I don't care about family!
[ groans ]

How did you learn how
to tie a knot like this?

Sam, how do you think

you can possibly run
a 300-person company

when you can't even control
your own teenage girl?

Will you be quiet?

Pathetic, misguided,

psychopathic,
bug-eyed, 52-pound freak.

Hey!
That's my daughter
you're talking to.

I told you to be quiet.
Emily.

Hit him!
Emily. Emily.

No. No.

Mom, I warned him.

No, go on.
Give him a hit.

No, no, no. I'll be good.
I'll be good.

[ doorbell rings ]

Well, that was
unfortunate timing.

Oh. Oh, hey. Hey, Em.

Hey.

S-something wrong, or...

Uh, no,
everything's great.
What's up?

Uh, nothing. Nothing much.

Okay. Uh, well,
I'm kinda busy
right now.

Uh, yeah, that's fine.

I just came by,
because I--

I wanted to ask you

if you watched the DVD
I made for you?

Actually I was
just about to go
do that, so...

Okay, so what did--
What did you think, then?

But I haven't
watched it yet.

Right. Heh.
Right. You said that.

Mm-hmm.

Ah. Um...

Okay, well,
I'm gonna go.

I'm gonna go
watch the DVD.

No, yeah, that's cool.
Okay, okay. Great.

All right, let me know.
Uh, cool.

Oh, hey, Em,
what are you--
what are you holding?

Is that like
a giant wooden penis?

Yep. Yes, it is.

Uh-huh. Great. Bye!
Oh. Oh.

I'll see you.

JACKSON: Nice one, Em.

Now he knows
where he measures up.

Get that thing
out of my face.

That was our deal.

You go psycho.
I make the movie.

This isn't
a movie, Jacks.

This is our family.

[ Mickey yells playfully ]

Oh, my G.

Oh, my G.

Oh, my G.
Oh, my Fing G.

So freaking rad.

I should have paid you
50 bucks.

Oh, my G.

Kat, give me your phone.

What?

Give me your phone,
Kat, now.

Stop--Ahh.

Hey, it's Em.

I'm gonna need
your help.

[ rope whipping ]

[ muffled speech ]

Well...

I must admit
I've wanted to do

something like this
for ages.

Now, this must be...

Rick,
Mom's boyfriend.

Oh, right.

GG: Let's put him somewhere

a man like him belongs,
shall we?

[ muffled ]
What are you doing to me?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Help!

Sorry, Rickels.

Shut up.

GG: Now, when I
sound the chime,

I want you to picture
your clouded mind

clearing into
a crisp, white expanse.

Here we go.

[ deep breath ]

[ Lucy sighs ]

Hello. My name is Tina.

DUNCAN:
Hello, Tina.

I'm here to turn you
from sad froggies

into happy froggies.

[ laughs ]

In my practice,
we use puppets.

Get your puppets.

We use the puppets
to detach us

from the emotional anchors
that drag us down.

That way,
our feelings can surface,

and our authentic self
can breathe.

SAM: Perfect. Puppets.

It's a perfect time
for puppets.

GG: All right,
are we ready to share?
Who wants to go first?

Oh, I do.
Oh, me! Me!

I said it first.
No.

[ clears throat ]

[ accent ]
We kidnapped
Mom and Dad.

How does that
make you feel?

Um, it's fun and scary.

Why is it scary?

Because it's
making everybody
a little crazy

and say mean things,

[ no accent ]
even more
than usual.

Hmm. Thank you
for sharing, Wanda.

That's excellent. Libby?

Hmm.

Uh, I just, well--

I just want my family

to care
about each other.

What about you?

Do you think
about others?

Well, I...

We're all here
right now

because we didn't go
to your jump-roping
competition.

We just couldn't
make it. That's it.

[ squawks ]

We could have made it,

maybe if we tried harder.

GG: That's great, Jackson.

It's Thor now.

Like the Norse God?

Yes! Finally!
Thank you.

Oh, that's good. Timsy?

Uh--Ahem! Uh...

Timsy wants
his family
to know that...

he loves them
very much.

And he knows that he
makes a lot of mistakes.

Everybody
makes mistakes, Timsy.

But he's doing
the best he can.

I don't like
the membrane.

The membrane
is your father's
protective shield.

I don't like
the membrane.

What?

I don't like
the membrane.

What else don't
you like, Mickey?

I don't like
loud talking,

I don't like the man
in the other room...

and I don't
like casserole.

That's fine.

Do you have anything else
that you want to say?

And I like bacon.

Yeah. Yeah.
[ laughter ]

I suppose I could
make the membrane
a little more permeable.

Thanks, Dad.

Thanks.

But I don't know
about the bacon.

Mimsy? Your family
has opened up.

Would you like
to share with us?

No.

Come on, Mom.

Come on, Mimsy.

Yeah, come on,
Mimsy.

No, no. I'm good.

Come on, Mimsy.

Don't ignore this
healing opportunity, Mimsy.

Come on, Mimsy.
Mimsy. Mimsy.

This is insane.
Mom, it's not very hard.

Why is it insane?
It's insane, because
you're a crazy person.

It's fun.
Let Mimsy speak.

I'm doing it.
I want to hear what
Mimsy has to say.

Mimsy thinks that you
should take your sage

and shove it where
your spirit guides don't shine.

Mom! Just try, please.

I try, okay?

I try every
single day, Emily.

And I'm sorry if
we're not the freaking
parents of the year,

but my apologies
to the selection committee.

But here's a news flash.

There are
no parents of the year.

No one comes
to give me trophies.

Nobody comes
to watch me compete.

And if you
think tying me up
and drugging me

and spraying air freshener
in my face are gonna
make our family closer,

then you were right, Emily.

We really have failed
in raising you, honey.

And it's much worse
than you think.

Thank you.

Emily!

I speak the truth.

[ rope whipping ]

When did everything
get so strange?

She's your daughter.

No, you.

Me?

Where do I even start?

What happened
to that wild chick
I married?

She wasn't afraid
of anything.

She--She'd
dine and dash.

She ate popcorn with
butter-flavored topping.

[ chuckles ]

She was gonna open
a vegan restaurant.

Can we not
do this right now?

She was gonna
cook veggies,

and I
was gonna paint.

She was fun,

sense of humor.

She was beautiful.

Was?

We were gonna do
anything we wanted.

Screw the rest
of the world.

Well, she grew up, Duncan.

Do you really think
we knew who we were
back then?

I think we knew
how to be happy.

Well, sometimes
life isn't happy.

Sometimes you do
what you have to do

instead of what
you want to do.

I do what I want to do.

Oh, I know. Exactly.

Duncan does whatever
Duncan wants to do.

If he wants to paint,
he paints.

If he wants to sit there,
he sits there.

While I keep this family
fed and clothed,

and I work my butt off.
Have you noticed?

I don't paint because
I want to paint.

I paint
because I have to.

Stop talking.

What are you
trying to say? Hmm?

Let's stop beating
around the bush.

Let's just
put all our cards
on the table.

Okay, okay,
you want me to say it?

Yeah.
Okay. Okay.

I want you to say it.
Say it.

Okay, here it goes.
You're stuck.

You got a bad review
in New York five years ago,

and you're stuck.

3 1/2.
What?

It was 3 1/2 years ago.

Whatever. You're stuck.

You have painter's block
or something.

It takes time
to make something
beautiful, Sam.

It took 9 months
to make each one of our
beautiful children.

Oh, I know. I was there.

I remember.

Duncan, I'm sorry.

I just--
I can't continue this way.

I can't do this anymore.
I just can't.

What do you mean
you can't do this?

Marriage is
a partnership, Duncan,

and right now
you are a lousy partner.

I just--

Okay.

I love your talent, Duncan.

I fell in love
with your talent.

Really?

Sometimes it's just--
It's not enough.

You could have taken
that graphic design job
I got for you.

I stuck my neck for you,
and you just blew it off,

Duncan style. Perfect.

I can't paint logos.

Here we go.

This is who I am, Sam,

for better or for worse.

This is who you married.

Do you want me
to be someone else?

I never asked you to be
someone else, Duncan.

Are you asking me now?

I don't know.

Good night, Mr. Toad.

And good night to you.

Well...

would you look at that?

Ohh.

You should probably
let them go soon.

[ knock on door ]

Go away.

It's Kat.

Great. Then go
further away.

So that's it?

After all that?

Just gonna quit and go
back to the way it was?

Yeah. And why
do you care?

We're not even
friends anymore,
remember?

I just think
it's a waste.

Well, in case
you haven't noticed,

it's been
a total disaster.

I can think
of several
other adjectives

that might apply.

Awesome, brave.

I think it's
totally ballsy.

You're kinda
my new freaking hero.

That is why
you cannot give up.

I mean, not yet.

But you gotta
chillax a little.

I mean, maybe you
didn't notice earlier,

but in between
head butts with your mom

was, like,
a real breakthrough
with your dad.

Yeah, I guess.

More than my mom.
She's so, like--

Much like you?

Yeah, I noticed.

That may not seem like
a compliment to you,

but it is.

I mean, come on.

Your mom is--
is intense, smart.

She's kind of
hard-core.

Parents
are people, too,

which means sometimes
they suck big hairy ass,

with, like,
toilet paper--

Okay, eww. Okay.
Point made.

Kids grow up
thinking their parents
were, like, perfect.

They feed you
and protect you,

and they're supposed
to have all the answers.

You end up
thinking they're,

like, superheroes
or something.

But then one day,
you--you find out

they just worked
at the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

Thanks.

Hey.

I'm sorry I sprayed
you in the face
with air freshener.

Are you gonna
say anything?

What do you
want me to say?

Something nice.

I'd love to.

I've been
bound and tied,

and we are going on
hour God knows what,

so I don't know
why I would say
something nice.

Because I don't remember
the last time you did.

I know what I did
was really messed up.

Yes.

And I know I'm
in a lot of trouble.

Yes.

But I'd do it
all over again,

if I'd thought
that it would help.

I'm not crazy.

I'm not.

I just--I miss the way
you used to be.

Do you remember
when I was little...

and there'd be, like,
a thunderstorm or something

and--or, like, a really
mean boy at school,

and I would get so upset

and just run in my room,
and I would hide.

And you'd come in,

and you'd lay down
next to me,

and you--you would
wrap your arms around me,
and you'd sing.

I miss her.

I really need her.

[ sighs ]

Anyway...

if you want to escape...

you can.

But you're gonna
have to do it together.

As for me,

I have a competition
to go win.

[ door closes ]

Hey.

Oh, my God.

You painted us.

Look at us.

We're beautiful.

Duncan...

hand me the knife.

Heh.

I'm sorry.
That's it.

Ah. Got it.

Oh, my God.

Baby, undo it.

Give it to me.
Okay. Here.

Wow.

[ giggles ]

Maybe just
a little bit longer.

[ laughs ]

If you could see
yourself right now.

[ crowd talking outside ]

MAN: Take her down!

Emily Smith-Dungy?

Sergeant Ellis
and Deputy Tyler,

Macomb County
Sheriff's
Department.

[ woman yells ]

Mm-hmm.

SGT. ELLIS:
Are your parents around?

Um, I'm kind of
in a hurry.

Could you maybe
come back later?

Afraid not.

We received
several reports

that there may
be a potentially
criminal situation

taking place
here in your home.

Uh, here? No.

There's
no criminal nothing.

Well, maybe you've heard
about some videos

that have been posted
on the Internet.

GIRL: Hey, Emily!

Smile!
I think, uh, we saw

some people tied up
in jump-rope and tape?

Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Jump-rope.

No. That's crazy.

May we enter
the premises, please?

Can I say no?

Actually,
you can say no.

I'm sorry. I'm just--

But then we'd be forced to
come back with a warrant.

I have a really
important competition

to be at in less
than one hour.

Okay, well, you may
have to be a little late.

But it's the State's.

I can't be late.

We just want
to ask a couple

of questions,
come inside--

[ chair clatters ]
What--Now--

Step aside, ma'am.
Step aside, ma'am.

Who else is
on the premises?

Um...

just, uh, my sister
and my two brothers.

Who's at the door, honey?

Oh. Good morning, officer.

And my parents.

Duncan, we have
some police officers
at the door.

What a surprise.

Yeah. We just--
We're getting ready

for our usual
Sunday brunch.

Come on, kids!

Get up, sleepyheads!

Brunch time!
Heh.

Heh heh.

Jump-rope.

Yeah, it's fun.

[ chuckles ] Yeah.

Athletic guy?
SAM: Yeah.

I'm a maniac.

Oh, he is.

So we got the entire
family on the premises?

SAM: Yes.
Uh-huh.

[ slippers squeaking ]

[ grunting ]

Yes.

Ohh. Thank you.

Uh, do you have
a knife anywhere,

maybe, that we
could use to cut these
little ropes free?

No? No, not a good idea?

Okay, you like money?

I'll give you 100 bucks,
you get me some aspirin,

'cause my head
and my shoulder
are killing me.

Yeah? Okay. Okay.

Okay, you freak.

Yesterday afternoon,
we got a few calls

from some
very concerned parents

after they found
some disturbing texts on
their kids' cellphones.

SAM: Oh, no.
Really?

Yeah, yeah. Then we
saw some videos posted
on the Internet

by someone named
Kataclysm.

We saw some
pretty serious offenses
in those videos.

That's--No, not us.

Aggravated assault,

drugs, and kidnapping.

Holy crap.
Heh.

Hey, buddy.

[ grunts ]

Oh, my man.

My man.

Thank you.

What are you--
That money--

No, no, wait.
We said 100. Hey.

For right now,
we just need
an explanation.

Uh...

School project.

School project.
That's what it was.

Yeah, we were making
a public service
announcement.

Yeah, we may
have made it
too realistic.

You guys. Ha!

You can't
teach talent.

Emily, have you
watched my DVD yet?

Okay, now,
who is this guy?

I need to know
if you watched it.

Chris, it's really
not a good time
right now.

But it's never a good time
in this house.

And I made you
a second copy in case
you lost the first one,

and I just
really want you--

Chris,
the boyfriend.

Heh heh.

Okay.

Chris, the DVD.

We were just
gonna watch it.

Sir, if we could just
finish a few questions.

But you won't
want to miss this.

It's competitive jump.

[ buzzes ]

[ crowd cheering ]

Okay, but we need
to finish up a few
questions first.

Chris, come in.
Join us.

Listen, we don't--
we don't really need

to watch this
right now.

Yeah, we do.

So exciting.

OFFICIAL: Emily Smith-Dungy!

I gotta tell you.

Well, thank you

Sir--Wait.
Who are you?

Last week, I drove
into a parked car.
I just drove off.

Sir--
I just drove--
whoop--right off.

Regularly
drink and drive.

Oh, my God. Sir--

Haven't paid
for cable ever.

Who is this man?

Uh, he works for me.

Okay, why didn't
you tell us

about him before?

He has, uh, special needs.

Yes, he's
a special-needs
cousin of ours.

Special.

Duncan. Duncan, brother,

I'm so sorry that I
tried to bang your wife.

What?

No, no. He didn't bang--

There was no banging.

You mean,
so you guys never--

He did not bang.

They never banged.

So sorry. Hey,
give me a hug, brother.

Give me a hug.

[ mouths word ]
DUNCAN: No, no, no.

No.
Oh, God.

That feels so good.

Sir, are you feeling
all right?

Yeah,
you're touching me

with your man parts.

Why don't men
hug more often?

I could just hug you
for hours.

Yeah, thank you.

I don't even care
that your daughter

hit me over the head
with a trophy

and--and put me
in a snake cage.

Aw, you big kidder, you.
Get out of here.

Now hold
the phone there.

Silly. Here.

Okay, sir,
can you repeat that?

RICK: Yeah.

Sir!
Mmm!

Did this young lady
assault you?

Greg, please.
Quiet, ma'am.

DEPUTY TYLER: Sir,

we're talking about
a felony charge.

[ dance music playing ]

Yeah.

It's my cellphone.

Sir.

Turn it off.
Sir!

Ooh, that's the stuff.

That's the stuff
right there.

Yeah, yeah.

Sir, please.
Russian Tea Room.

[ grunting ] Yeah.

Sir, I am ordering you
to stop dancing.

Tick-tack, tick-tack.

Go ahead. Shoot him.

Whoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!
Sir!

[ music stops ]

Who killed the beat?

Sorry, dude.
Oh, my God.

Take care of him.

Ma'am...
Come on.

I need an explanation.

RICK: Kills on
the dance floor.

[ all talking ]

I just wanted
to make a movie.

Whoa, whoa. I need
an explanation from her.

Folks.
I just really like her.

[ all talking ]

I'm gonna take this
gentleman to jail
if he does not stop.

Okay, I can't
hear everyone--

High! I been flyin' high!

Sir!

[ Rick screams ]

Sir!

Hi-yee!

Sir!

Ma'am.

I just wanted them
to see me jump.

[ sighs ]

Ma'am, I understand that,

but that's really not
a good enough explanation

for what's happening
here today.

Oh, no. [ coughs ]

Sir, excuse me.

I'm sorry. What?

What are you doing?

I'm smoking pot.

Put that down. Sir.

Smoke pot. Smoke pot.

Excuse me.
LUCY: Everybody smoke.

No, you cannot
do that.

Sir! Sir!
[ crowd murmurs ]

Revolution!

[ cheering ]

No revolution!

Listen to me!
Sir, stop!

â™ª Smoke pot, smoke pot,
everybody smoke pot â™ª

â™ª Smoke...

You ready?

Okay, good.
Grab your bag.

It's got everything

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Kat's gonna take you?

Okay, well, good luck.

Love you.

I am commanding you
to stop! Sir!

[ crowd yelling ]

Wait, wait, wait!

I am going
to arrest you, sir.

I am going
to arrest you.

Whoo! Oww!

Holy Fing S.

Yaah!

Revolution!

Revolution!

Whoo!
You are under arrest.

This is ridiculous.

I've never had
to deal with this...

I want to press
charges on that
psycho girl.

We will apprehend her.

Sir, I need you
to settle down.

ANNOUNCER: Ready. Set. Go.

[ crowd cheering ]

[ sighs ]

Well, get going.
You're late.

I drugged and then
tied up my parents.

Everybody knows.

1,500 hits
in 3 hours.

You're famous.

More like infamous.

Everyone's gonna think
I'm a freak.

Well, did you
think you were
normal before?

I mean, you spend
your lunch breaks
jumping rope.

But look at it
this way.

Now you are
the queen freak

from, like,
a seriously royal
freak bloodline.

They will bow
and tremble

in your superfreaky
presence.

Trust me. It is
better at the top.

You deserve this.

Plus you're really pretty.

Fuck it.

[ girls murmuring ]

What's she doing here?

Did you see
those clips?

Emily Smith-Dungy.

Right that way.

[ crowd cheering ]

Come on. Go.

Em, hurry.

I'm here!

Are you Emily?
Uh-huh.

Okay, here's
your square here.

Jump outside
the lines--

Looks like
you're all legal.

Okay. You're set.
Thanks.

ANNOUNCER: Jumpers, ready.

Set. Go.

Attica! Attica!

I need you
to calm down.

You got it, man!
You got it, man!

Ma'am, I cannot do this
with you right now.

His daughter
just throwing me
in a cage.

It's just a complete
misunderstanding.

No, I need you to tell me
where your daughter--

Where is your daughter?
You arrest me, too,

'cause I'm not
telling you.

Okay, well,
I'll just have to come
back here and do that.

Your daughter's
a felony suspect.

I'm not telling you
where she is.

I'm sure you're not.
After what happened here...

You know
I'm okay with you
being straight.

Thanks. Are you,
like, in trouble?

No.

Where is she?

I couldn't say.
You couldn't say?

You know, you don't
have to be different
to be an artist.

You just have
to have the courage

to show the world
who you really are.

Do you know who you are?

I'm Jackson Smith-Dungy,

your son.

Cool.

Well, we will find
your daughter,

but I need you
to know that.
Okay.

This is not okay.
Nothing that has happened

here today is okay.
Right. Of course.

Good luck. Good luck.
Thank you.

Hey, I got a medical
marijuana card
in my wallet.

Let's have some fun.

Let's go, sir.
Okay.

Wait. Why are you
trying to arrest my dad?

What are
you saying?

Put your gun down!

I don't have
a gun out.

Well, why don't
I just show it
to you right now?

Oh, snap.

[ footsteps echoing ]

Cops.

Come on.
Let's go.

We're coming,
honey!

[ music playing only ]

[ faint siren blaring ]

EMILY: Some people are
lucky enough to find
their true passion.

[ alarm beeping ]

Yeah?

Yeah.
Is it good?

It was awesome.
Heh heh.

Hey, come on,
little buddy.

Gotta get ready.

Don't want to be late.

[ rope whipping ]

â™ª I know you left me
standing there... â™ª

EMILY: That's okay,

because their passion
makes them feel
like something...

â™ª I don't believe
the words you said â™ª

â™ª But I can't
find the words... â™ª

EMILY: ...like somebody.

â™ª Oh, I can't find
the words I want â™ª

Sometimes it's
the only thing
that keeps them moving.

â™ª ...gone in
another life â™ª

â™ª I don't believe
I would just survive â™ª

â™ª I could feel you
next to me... â™ª

EMILY: I know some people
don't get mine,

my passion.

â™ª ...the world I'm in

â™ª Oh, I'm afraid...

It's jumping rope
competitively...

but I like it.

â™ª Ah oh oh oh...

Just me and the rope.

I'm in total control.

I can let
everything else go

and focus on that one thing.

[ applause
and cheering ]

â™ª One day, I will
see heaven's reach â™ª

â™ª I'll find the one
who left me sleeping â™ª

â™ª Every war was
another seed â™ª

â™ª That could feed
every soul in need â™ª

EMILY: I guess
it could be anything...

4, 3, 2, 1!

but I chose jumping rope.

Whoo!
Whoo!

And I'm not sure
if there's anything
that I could possibly

love more.

Smith-Dungy.

â™ª The world you left

â™ª Oh, I'm lost and found

Your family's here
to take you home.

â™ª Oh, I'm lost and found

Um...

Bye.

Bye, Em.

Bye, Em.
Pah.

Yay!

Look at this,
you guys. Yeah.

You were amazing
back there.

Those are
all natural.

Good to see you.

Thank you.

[ music playing ]

â™ª Somebody found me here

â™ª Whoa oh oh oh

â™ª Somebody found my breath

â™ª Whoa oh oh oh

â™ª Somebody saved me
from the world you left â™ª

â™ª Whoa oh oh oh

â™ª If you're gonna
cry my tears â™ª

â™ª If you're gonna
hold my breath â™ª

â™ª If you're gonna let me see
the sun you set â™ª

â™ª Oh, I am lost and found

â™ª Oh, I am lost and found

â™ª Oh, I am lost and found

â™ª Oh, I am lost and found
