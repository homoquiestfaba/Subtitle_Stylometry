For those regarded as warriors...

...when engaged in combat...

...the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the
warriors only concern.

Suppress all human emotions and compassion...

...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord
God,

or Buddha himself.

This truth lies at the heart of combat.

Look at me Matsumoto...

...take a good look at my face.

Look at my eyes.

Look at my nose.

Look at my chin.

Look at my mouth.

Do l look familiar?

Do l look like someone you murdered!

Welcome...

We have a customer. Bring out some tea, quickly!

l'm watching my soap operas.

Lazy bastard...

Screw your soap opera...

The tea's hot. Why don't you serve it yourself for
once?

Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up...goddamit!

Lazy oaf...

What'd ya want?

One warm sake!

Sake? ln the middle of the day?

-Day, night, afternoon-
Who gives a damn. Get the sake!

How come l always have to get the sake?

You listen well...

For thrity years you make the fish.
l get the sake.

lf this were the military, l'd be a General by now!

Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

lf you were General, l'd be Emporer,

and you'd still get the sake.
So shut up and get the sake!

l'm not bald, okay? l shave my head.

What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

l need Japanese steel.

Why do you need Japanese steel?

l have vermin to kill.

l wanted to show you these.

However, someone as you, who knows so much,
must surely know...

...l no longer make instruments of death.

What l have here l keep for their aesthetic and
sentimental value.

Yet proud as l am of my life's work...

...l have retired.

You can sleep here.

lt will take me a month to make the sword.

l suggest you spend it practicing.

l've completed doing...

what l swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

...to never do again.

l have created, ''something that kills people.''

And in that purpose, l was a success.

l've done this because philosophically, l am
sympathetic to your aim.

l can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

lf on yourjourney, you should encounter God...

...God will be cut.

Yellow-haired warrior. Go.

Do you like Ferraris?

Ferrari...ltalian trash.

Do you want to fuck me?

Don't laugh. Do you want to fuck me, yes or no?

Yes.

How 'bout now, big boy?

Do you still wish to penetrate me...

...or is it l...who has penetrated you?

Boss Tanaka! What's the meaning of this outburst?

This is a time for celebration!

And what exactly are we celebrating?

The perversion of our illustrious council?

Tanaka, have you gone mad? l will not tolerate this!

You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

My father along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.

And while...

...You laugh like stupid donkeys
they weep in the afterlife...

Shut up!

...over the perversion committed today!

Outrageous! Tanaka, it is you who insults this
council!

Bastard!

Fuck face!

Gentlemen.

Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

By all means, allow him to express it.

l speak of the perversion done to this council,

...which l love...

...more than my own children,

...by making a Chinese Jap-American half breed
bitch its leader!

So that you understand how serious l am...

...l'm going to say this in English.

Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

You have to say ''Yes, yes, yes'' to any selfish
demands they make.

They demand ridiculous things.

Shut up-- Do you know what would happen if they
heard you?

-What's gonna happen?
-Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

You're gonna get your head chopped off.

No, l don't want that.

Yes, it's me.

And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

Hey. You!

Who do you remind me of?

Charlie Brown!

You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown.

Charlie Brown,
Four pepperoni pizzas.

-That's not on our menu...
-l don't care, bring them, goddammit!

Hey...hey...
Charlie, give me a kiss.

You and l have unfinished business!

Charlie Brown, beat it.

TEAR THE BlTCH APART!

Gogo, right?

And you're Black Mamba.

Our reputations precede us.

Don't they?

You call that begging?

You can beg better than that.

Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives take them with you!

However...

...leave the limbs you've lost.

They belong to me now.

Where was it made?

Whome in Okinawa made you this steel?

YOU LlE!

Swords however, never get tired.

l hope you've saved your energy.

lf you haven't...

...you might not last five minutes.

But as last looks go,

you could do worse.

Attack me...

...with everything you have.

For ridiculing you earlier...

...l apologize.

Accepted.

Ready?

Come on.

That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Burn in Hell you stupid, stupid blonde!
l'll tell you nothing.

Master...

Your Mandarin is lousy.

lt causes my ears discomfort. You bray like an ass!

You are not to speak unless spoken to.

ls it too much to hope you understand Cantonese?

l speak Japanese very well...

l didn't ask if you speak Japanese,

l asked if you understand Cantonese?

You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu,

not linguistics.

lf you can't understand me,

l will communicate with you like l would a dog.

When l yell, when l point,

when l beat you with my stick!

Bill is your master, is he not?

Your master tells me you're not entirely unschooled.

What training do you possess?

''The exquisite art of the samurai sword.''

Don't make me laugh!

Your so-called exquisite art, is only fit for...

Japanese fatheads!

Your anger amuses me.

Do you believe you are my match?

No.

Are you aware l kill at will?

Yes.

ls it your wish to die?

No.

Then you must be stupid...

Then you must be stupid...so stupid.

Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face.

Rise.

So, my pathetic friend,

is there anything that you can do well?

What's the matter?

Cat got your tongue?

Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

l despise the goddamn Japs!

Go to that rack.

Remove the sword.

Let's see how good you really are.

lf...

you land a single blow,

l'll bow down and call you ''master.''

From here you can getan excellentviewof myfoot.

Your swordsmanship is amateur at best.

Your so-called kung-fu is really...quite pathetic.

l asked you to demonstrate
what you know and you did...

Not a goddamn thing!

Let's see your Tiger-Crane match my Eagle's Claw.

Like all Yankee women,

all you can do is order in restaurants...

and spend a man's money.

Excruciating, isn't it?

Yes!

lf it was my wish...

l could chop your arm off.

lt's my arm now. l can do what l please.

lf you can stop me, l suggest you try.

Because you're helpless?

Yes.

Have you ever felt this before?

No.

Compared to me,

you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle?

Yes!

That's the beginning!

ls it your wish to possess this kind of power?

Your training will begin...tomorrow.

Since your arm now belongs to me...

l want it strong.

Can you do that?

l can, but not that close.

Then you can't do it.

What if your enemy is three inches in front of you?

What do you do then?

Curl into a ball,

or do you put your fist through him?

Now begin.

lt's the wood that should fear your hand,

not the other way around.

No wonder you can't do it,

you acquiesce to defeat, before you even begin.

lf you want to eat like a dog,

you can live and sleep outside like a dog.

lf you want to live and sleep like a human,

pick up those sticks.

Elle, you treacherous dog.

l give you my word...

Clarita

Tequila.

Thanks.
