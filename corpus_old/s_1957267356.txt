[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

you to get in the van.

We can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

Help!

Somebody help!

They're kidnapping me!

Please stop!

I'm being kidnapped!
Somebody help me!

Help! Help! Please, let me go!

[â™ªâ™ª]


<i>Let's rewind.</i>

<i>I have the American Dream...</i>

<i>a house in the suburbs,
two children.</i>

Are you smaller than a shoe?

Yes, I am smaller than a shoe.

Are you loud or quiet?

I am very, very quiet.

Three questions left.
[text alert chimes]

<i>I lost the love of my life
in a car accident.</i>

<i>A few years later, I met Kyle.</i>

[inhales sharply]

<i>Kyle proposed.</i>

<i>We moved in,</i>

<i>and I thought maybe,
just maybe,</i>

<i>I had another shot
at my happily-ever-after.</i>

Are you an insect?
Yes.

Do you bite?

Yes.

Are you an ant?

Yeah!

[smack]
I am. Good job.


Where's Kyle?

He's, uh... probably on his way.

Okay.
Who wants chicken fingers?

I do!

"The footmen jumped aboard

and they raced off
to the castle,

where Cinderella and her Prince
lived happily ever after.

The end."

That was a good story.

Yeah, it was.

Okay. Bedtime.

And you, homework. Okay?

And leave it out,
so I can check it, please.

Goodnight, John Christopher.

Goodnight, kiddo.

Let's get you in bed.

Goodnight. I love you.

Goodnight, Mom.

Love you, too.

[car engine turns off]

[car door closes]

[car lock chirps]

[â™ªâ™ª]

It's late.

Sorry.

There were meetings.

Kids asleep?

Hungry?

Mm. Grabbed something
on the way home.

The bank called.
The check bounced.

I'll take care of it.


[â™ªâ™ª]

[woman giggling]

Mom?

Wait here.

[woman giggling]

Anna!

Anna, wait.

What is wrong with you?

You asked me to marry you.

I know!

I just... we were...

I can do better.

I can be better.

No. You can't.

Anna.

Let's go, kids.

Bye, Kyle.

<i>I should have known better.</i>

<i>There's no such thing
as happily ever after.</i>

<i>When I left home at 15,</i>

<i>my cousin Letty</i>

<i>was the only one
who understood.</i>

<i>She was successful,</i>

<i>a business owner.</i>

<i>Not exactly a fairy godmother.</i>

Okay, kids.

Letty, it's me!

Open up!

Hi, Letty.

Hey, kids.

What happened?

Sharron.

Take the couch.

Okay, go on.

[indistinct conversations]

Not much on here.

Well, uh, what you can't see

are the two kids

and the amount of work
that it takes to raise them

after their dad passed.

I'm an excellent multi-tasker

with top-of-the-line
management skills.

I can do laundry,
check homework,

break up a fight,
cook a meatloaf,

and play a game
of 20 Questions

all at the same time.


True story.

Mm-hmm.

I'm great with people.

Memory like an elephant,

and when I make up my mind
to do something,

I get it done.

Education?

Uh, well, I-I, uh,
I left home early,

so, uh, no.

I didn't quite
finish high school.

Computer proficiency?

Power Point?

Video editing?

Wordpress?

[chuckles meekly]

[â™ªâ™ª]

You know...

you could always come
work for me.

No.
Why not?

[scoffing]
There's no shame in it.

It's the oldest profession
in the world.

It's illegal.

It's a living.

Mom, come play.

You'd rather wait tables
for $2.13 an hour?

Good luck raising your kids
on that,

and you can't
stay with me forever.

Yeah, well...

I'll figure something out.

What if you didn't
have to touch anyone?

You could work the front desk,
do some scheduling,

housekeeping...

be my eyes and ears.

Still no.
Not going to jail.

I've been doing this 15 years.
I haven't spent a day in prison.

Haven't even come close.

You know what I've learnt?

Men make all the rules.

They get what they want
whenever they want it.

But there's one thing
they always want

that we don't
have to give them.

We can make them pay for it.

Make the system work for us.

Think about it.

[John Christopher] Mom.

Who's ready
for a tickle fight?

Thank you, Mom.

Restroom.

Massage room one, two,

three, four.

Waiting area, reception desk.

Well?

What do you think?

It's, uh... nice.

Right?
Yeah.

Yeah. [chuckles]

Okay. Let's go.

Employees, line one.

Regulars, line two.

Outside, line three.

Cash only, paid up front.

Girls negotiate their own tips.

Okay. Half-hour, hour.

Bubble bath.

What about the, uh...

special services?

If anyone ever asks you
for special services...

He's a cop.

too many questions...

He's a cop.

And if you just don't know...


Send him to room four.
Joy loves cops.

She does. She loves cops.

Okay.
Lesson one.

No amount of money
is worth your freedom.

Okay.
Oof. Ain't that the truth.

Anna, I'm Arthur.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

Call me Art.
Nice to meet you.

He's my accountant and lawyer.

Extraordinaire.

Okay.

I keep this place
on the up and up,

so if you have any questions,
don't hesitate.

I'm around here all the time.

All the time.

Okay, good. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

I like her, Letty.

Thursday?


Don't make me miss you.

stickers, or...

Thursday.

[hushed exchange, indistinct]

Are you the cousin?

Hey. I'm Anna.

Welcome to the family, mamacita.

Bethany! Marjie!

Get your asses in here
and say hi to the new girl.

I'm Tina.

Nice to meet you.

This is Marjie.
Pleasure to meet you.

Bethany.
Hi. I'm Bethany.

Lovely to meet you.
Anna.

Okay, all right, everybody,
back to work, back to work.

We'll talk later.
You got kids?

I have two.

I got kids!
We should hang out. Call me.

I'll teach you
everything I know.

After work.
All right.

Anna.

This is where
you're gonna start, okay?

Yeah.

Restrooms. Massage room
one, two, three, and four.


<i>but would you believe it...</i>

<i>I found something I was good at.</i>

Tina and Bethany
available at that 11:00 time.

<i>I made it my business</i>

<i>to know everything
about everyone...</i>

<i>both the girls
and the clients.</i>

<i>Birthdays, anniversaries,</i>

<i>kids' names,
places of employment.</i>

<i>I updated our scheduling system
so it ran without a hitch.</i>

Girls, I'm having
a dry cleaning.

but it was more than that.</i>

<i>They needed someone
in their life</i>

<i>to take care of them.</i>

<i>They'd been abused,
abandoned, and let down.</i>

<i>They needed family
and friends...</i>

<i>and so did I.</i>

-Sit. Have one.

â™ª Happy birthday to you

and they took care of me.</i>

<i>We were in it together.</i>

â™ª ...Tina

Make a wish!




Deep thoughts, kiddo?

How much longer
do we have to stay here?

This bed is way too small
for three people.

We'll get our own place

as soon as I've got
enough money saved up. Okay?

Okay.

I got a plan.

Mm.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Try to get some sleep, okay?

Okay.
Okay.

[â™ªâ™ª]

You've never seen so much
complaining in your life.

It's a nightmare,
I'm telling you.

Hello.

Ohh. I'd really hoped we'd seen
the last of "Enema Man".

"Enema Man"?

What's...
What's that even mean?


Um, can I show you guys
something?

<i>Although we were
all making money,</i>

<i>we weren't making enough,</i>

<i>and I wanted better
for myself,</i>

<i>the girls, and my kids.</i>

Okay, so,
I was going over the books...

Who told you to do that?

No one. I was just
trying to help

and thinking about how
to increase profit margins.

Good on you.
Let's hear it.

Okay. So, we do great business
on Saturdays, right?

Between 4:00 and 9:00,

we make anywhere between
$800 to $1,500, on average,

but we're still
competing against

every other massage parlor
on the street...

there's six, by the way.
I'm aware.

But, on Sundays,
only Big Freddie's is open,

and that's from 10:00 to 2:00.

So we could open
from noon to 6:00

and charge a premium.

If business is good,

I mean, we could increase
our weekly profits by 30%.

"Our"?

Your.

I like it.

I don't.

Wait. Why not?

You get greedy,
you get pinched.

It's not greed, it's...
it's expansion.

Don't ask me again.

Hmm. I'll talk to her.

Speaking of expansion...

you might want to grab
an extra bottle of bleach.

Why?


<i>so this was my life.</i>

<i>I was as far away
from the American Dream</i>

<i>as I could get.</i>


[both chuckling]

<i>Mira.</i>


Hey, Marjie!

Oh.

Well...

I guess she's too fancy
for us now.

Enema Man
was her breaking point.

I don't get it.

There's what I do
at the parlor...

$40 to $60 a pop...

then there's what she does now.

How much?

Thousand an hour?

What?
Minimum.

Maybe more.
She's "A"-list now.

I was making
that kind of cash,

I would leave my Hector
tomorrow.

He gets so emotional,
you know?

Maybe I could go
back to school.

Put some savings away
for the kids.

Hmm.

Buy a few
investment properties,

like a real boss.

What's going on
in that brain of yours?

[Anna chuckles quietly]

[singing quietly, indistinct]

[buzzer blares]


Hi. Do you have an appointment?

I, uh...

What's your name?
Is Tina here?

I actually sent her out
to run a few errands...


I can smell her perfume!

I know she's with someone.

I know what she does.

Okay. She is one of
our best masseuses.

Is she with someone now?

I want to see her! And him!

Out here! Right now!

Okay.

Whoa.

Tina!

Tina! Come out here right now!

Shame on you.

Give that to me.

What? Shame on me?

Yeah, Tina said you were smart,

that you were
a hard-working man.

What the hell is wrong with you?

You have two great kids!

And you want to come into
your wife's place of employment

with a gun

and accuse her of doing
something inappropriate?

Are you stupid? Are you?

No.

Are you crazy?

No! I just wasn't...

...Thinking!
Yes, that's right.

You weren't thinking,
but that's okay,

'cause I'm gonna think
for the both of us, okay?

Now, give me the gun
before you ruin your life.

Come on, I don't have
all day, all right?

So give me the gun
before I call the cops

and tell them that
Hector Mendoza's a psychopath

and he...
I'm not a psychopath.

Don't make me
count to three, okay?

[Hector sobbing]
One...

[Hector sobs]

Two...

[Anna shrieks]

Chill out! Chill out!

Chill! You all right?

were you thinking?

It's not that big of a deal.

What are you talking about?

Calling the cops
is a huge deal!

Tina never
should have done that.

She's fired.

Whoa! Can we just think
about this rationally?

There were gunshots.

What the hell
was she supposed to do?

Not call the cops!

Now we're on their radar.

I got a whole department
wanting massages for 25% off.

That's the last thing we need!

Why'd you even open the door
in the first place?

I thought he was a customer
and we needed the money.

We always need the money

because you refuse to update

and modernize
your business practices.

Just because you read a book

doesn't mean you know
how to run a business, Anna.

It's common sense. Okay?

If we charged a premium,

we would have
higher-quality clients,

the girls would work less,

and we wouldn't have to hustle
for every single dime.

I mean, Enema Man?

One point Anna.

Look, I've run
the numbers, okay?

Work smarter not harder.

We could do so much
for ourselves,

for the girls,
for everyone,

if we just make a few changes.

I like this.
Two points Anna.

Goodnight, Arthur.

Yep. Goodnight.

Good luck.

So you think
you can do better?

I think
the girls can do better.

And I think you can do better.

I like my place.

[Anna sighs]

I can afford my place.

It's people like you

who think too big
and aim too high

that end up in prison.

Don't fire Tina.

It's already done.

Well, then, if she goes,

I go.

Fine.

Fine.


<i>No money, no job,</i>

<i>and was about to be
thrown out on the street</i>

<i>with my kids.</i>

So what do we do now?

We could be secretaries.

Yeah.

I'd let you come stay with us,

but me and the kids are back
living with my mother.

Look.

Letty won't tell you this,

but in the six months
that you worked there,

things have never run smoother...

except that last part.

Really?
Art said so every day.

Milo! Celeste!

<i>Vamonos.</i>

Why don't you open
your own business?

Seriously?

Why not?

I'd come work for you.

Think about it.

See you around.

Yeah.

<i>Ãndale, mijitos.</i>

Let's go.

<i>And that's when I decided</i>

<i>I had to take a leap.</i>

<i>I had nothing to lose.</i>

[dialing phone]

<i>[line ringing]</i>

Hey, Art? It's me.

I have a crazy idea.

Well, kids.

What do you think?

It's gross.

Smells like poop.

No, John Christopher.
This smells like potential.

I see it.

Oh, by the way, you're it.

with a $5,000 loan from Arthur</i>

<i>and what I'd learned
from my cousin,</i>

<i>but I wasn't
going to have my girls</i>

<i>service nobodies
for pennies a pop.</i>

<i>They were going to get paid
what they were worth.</i>

<i>We were going to be the ones
in control.</i>

<i>We were going to be exclusive.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]


Anna Christine,
ladies and gentlemen!

<i>If I was going to be the best,</i>

<i>I had to hire the best.</i>

Look at you!

We're gonna do it.

Do you have boyfriends?

<i>Tina told her friends,
who told their friends,</i>

<i>and so on.</i>

<i>The girls knew me, liked me,
and wanted to work for me.</i>

<i>I made it a point to interview
every last one of them.</i>

Do you do drugs?

<i>First rule. No drugs.</i>

<i>But I was tough.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

Do you drink? Smoke? Party?

Never.

This is a temple.

Husband?
Boyfriend? Lover?

No man alive that lucky.

No boyfriends.</i>

How tall are you?
I'm 6'1".

70% legs

and the rest
is boobs and attitude.

She's great.

Victoria?

Oh...

Vicky. A "Victoria"
would have nicer shoes.

Thank you.


<i>I liked her right away.</i>

So tell me about you.

What do I need to know?

Well, I left home when I was 15
for reasons I won't get into,

but you know who JR is?

I'm gonna be like him,

but, like,
the female version of him.

I believe in playing for keeps

and the best revenge
is living well.

But just because I'm a runaway
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

I'm putting myself
through school.

I'm a sophomore.

English Lit
with a business minor,

but that tuition is a beast.

John Christopher.

Hey, kiddos, I'm working.
I'm so sorry.

Does that mean I'm it?
Mm-hmm.


<i>I put together</i>

<i>the hottest, sexiest
group of girls in New York.</i>

<i>Once you get the girls,
you get the clients.</i>

<i>The market comes</i>

<i>through networking on the beat,
on your feet,</i>

<i>but not on the streets.</i>

<i>That was low-class.</i>

<i>I wanted the high-rollers.</i>

<i>Drivers were an easy way in.</i>

<i>Their clients were always rich
and looking for a pretty girl.</i>

<i>Give them a cut,
and they'll do you a solid.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>All my girls got makeovers
from the top down.</i>

<i>They had to be the best version
of themselves.</i>

<i>And so did I.</i>

<i>No expense spared.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>And then we beat the openings,
the galleries,</i>

<i>exclusive parties
in the Hamptons.</i>

â™ª Girls on top

â™ª Looking hot
Hot, hot, hot â™ª

<i>Everyone wanted to know
who we were,</i>

<i>but I wasn't interested
in everyone.</i>

<i>I wanted the best.</i>

â™ª Feels so good...

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>I had an eye for picking out
the millionaires in the room,</i>

<i>but I wasn't interested
in seven-figure guys.</i>

<i>I wanted eight-
and nine-figure guys.</i>

<i>Men with real money.</i>

<i>Billionaires.</i>

â™ª ...And the moon is up...

<i>I gave them a tease,</i>

<i>and suddenly,</i>

<i>I was in business...</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>...or so I thought.</i>

[phone rings]

Empire Elite Consulting.
This is Anna. How can I...

Yeah. I know it's late, kiddos.

I'll be home soon
to tuck you in, okay?

<i>It had been a week
since we hit our last event</i>

<i>and no one had called.</i>

<i>I was almost out of cash</i>

<i>and beginning to think
I'd made a huge mistake.</i>

[phone rings]


John Christopher, I thought
I told you that I was on my w...

Yes, this is Anna.
How can I help you?

<i>Edward.
Of course, I remember you.</i>

<i>So, tell me, if I could
conjure up your dream girl,</i>

<i>what would she look like,
and what would she do for you?</i>

And I have
the perfect one for you.

She's one of my A-List girls.

College. Smart.

Beautiful.

Let me just check
her availability.

<i>With my first client,
I played it like Studio 54.</i>

<i>You know how, like,
in the early days,</i>

<i>there'd be a line outside,</i>

<i>but inside the club
would be empty?</i>

<i>Well, that created demand.</i>

<i>It made clients...</i>

<i>especially
those hedge-fund guys</i>

<i>who always got
what they wanted...</i>

<i>want it more.</i>

Well, unfortunately,
she makes her own schedule

and she has exams coming up
so she's unavailable,

but I do have another girl...

You're free to call back.

In the next few days,
something might've opened up,

but I honestly...
I can't guarantee anything.

My girls don't work for me.
I work for them.

Bye-bye.

<i>It was
the biggest gamble of my life.</i>

[phone rings]

Empire Elite Consulting.

This is Anna.
How can I help you?

Edward.

I'm so happy
you called back.

Actually, Friday cleared up
and Vicky's available,

if you'd like to see her.

Remember, he specifically
requested a college girl,

so when in doubt,
talk school, literature.

He'll love it.

Presidential Suite?

Only the best for the best.

That's him.

<i>Edward Franklin, age 54.</i>

<i>Pharmaceutical CEO.</i>

<i>Net worth: 376 million.</i>

<i>Alias: Big Pharma.</i>

He summers every year
in the Hamptons

and has a yacht
named "The Antoinetta".

Make me proud.

Edward.

Hi.

This is Victoria.

Lovely.

Well, I've got
some calls to make.

You two enjoy each other.

Drink?

Water. Sparkling.

Very good.

[â™ªâ™ª]

I heard a rumor.

Oh, yeah?

What's that?

That you have a yacht.

"The Antoinetta"?

As in
the "Bertha Antoinetta Mason"?

Jane Eyre?


Sounds dangerous.

I like it.


[â™ªâ™ª]

Did you two enjoy each other?

I'll be back in town
in a month...

...if she has room
on her schedule.

Absolutely.

<i>And just like that...</i>

<i>I had my first regular.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

No. That's your first semester.

Thank you.

Elite Consulting, this is Anna.
Can you please hold?

Yes. When are you in town?

<i>It only took
a few satisfied customers</i>

<i>to spread the word.</i>

<i>One client became two,</i>

<i>two became three...</i>

<i>a dozen.</i>

<i>Everyone knew
I had the best girls</i>

<i>and everyone wanted in,</i>

<i>but I refused
to just take anyone.</i>

<i>Quality over quantity.</i>

<i>I screened every client.</i>

<i>I knew who they were,</i>

<i>what they did for a living,</i>

<i>and most importantly,
what they were worth.</i>

<i>Each had an alias,</i>

<i>and I matched them perfectly
to each girl.</i>

<i>And, like my girls,
I only worked with the best...</i>

<i>no drunks, druggies,
wife-beaters, or degenerates.</i>

<i>They paid in cash by the hour...</i>

<i>two-hour, $2,000 minimum.</i>

<i>Business started booming.</i>

<i>I had a standard 50% cut,</i>

<i>and my clients
trusted my discretion.</i>

<i>Six months later,</i>

<i>me and the kids
moved into our new house...</i>

<i>the perfect house...</i>

<i>a place of our own...</i>

<i>excited and happy.</i>

Where's my room, Uncle Art?

Well, I don't know, buddy.
Maybe we should go look.


Here we go!
Let's go!

<i>if he could have.</i>

<i>Safe neighborhood, big backyard,</i>

<i>one of
the best school districts</i>

<i>in the country.</i>

<i>We were on our way
to the American Dream.</i>

I love you.

I love you, too, kiddo.

<i>But it wasn't all perfect.</i>

<i>I remembered what Letty said
and I was always on edge.</i>

[knocking at door]

Hell, I had
almost $900,000 in cash

upstairs in shoe boxes

because I couldn't risk
opening up a bank account.

Admit it.
I had great ideas.

Why didn't you just try
one new thing?

Ohh. Maybe I should've.

You definitely should've,

because, I mean...


I'm happy for you.

You deserve it.

I had to shut down.
Why?

It wasn't because of
the Hector thing, was it?

I think the Feds
may have been onto me.

Getting close, anyway.

How'd you know?

Just a feeling.

Too many hung-up calls.

Cars I didn't recognize,
driving by too slow.

Too often.

That's partly why
I couldn't branch out.

Didn't know
if I was being watched.

Well, why didn't you
say anything?

Mm. My business, my problem.


Well, I mean,
if you need some extra cash,

you can, uh, you can always
come work for me.

You can't afford me.


I'll think about it.


my team was complete.</i>

There you go, sweetheart.

Hey, Mom.

Hi, beautiful girl.

<i>Welcome to my double life.</i>

<i>On the weekdays,</i>

<i>my children
were off to school by 7:00.</i>

<i>My daughter rode horses
and my son played soccer.</i>

<i>As for my business,
I ran it like a Fortune 500.</i>

<i>I ran it
clean, honest, and fair.</i>

<i>I shut my phone off
on Friday night</i>

<i>and never worked a weekend
unless there was a problem.</i>

[Anna shrieks]

<i>I even opened a nail salon
as a front</i>

<i>to keep things legal...</i>

<i>well, legal-ish.</i>

<i>And to give my kids
something to say</i>

<i>when people asked
what I did for a living.</i>

<i>Vicky and Tina were
my first paying customers.</i>

[laughing and shrieking]

All right, so,
I'm gonna be at your game,

but Ms. Robbie's gonna
give you a ride there, okay?

Okay.

I love you.
Hey! Learn something today.

Bye, honey.

I owe you so much.
Thank you.

Oh. And here are some snacks
for half-time.

Perfect.

Oh. How many raffle tickets
did you want this year?

Uh... a thousand.

Anything for
the Eastside Eagles, right?

Yeah.

All right, thank you, honey.

I appreciate it.
See ya.

Bye.

[gasps as brakes screech]

Oh! So sorry.

[school bell rings]


<i>I'd go into the city
to do business.</i>

<i>I never knew what to expect,</i>

<i>but, honestly,</i>

<i>I stopped being surprised
a long time ago.</i>

That's him.

Go get him, girls.

<i>Adam Saltzmeyer.
Age 41.</i>

<i>Hedge fund manager
at Clark & Darrow.</i>

<i>Net worth: half a billion.</i>

<i>Alias: Amber Alert.</i>

What are you doing?
Shut up.

What's going on?
Who are you guys?

Tell me you've been naughty!
Let's go.

[Adam groaning, muffled]

Someone's been naughty!

And he has a bad peepee.

I have a bad peepee.


<i>Just the thrill
of getting abducted</i>

<i>and slapped around</i>

<i>by two of my "A"-list girls
for an hour.</i>

<i>Fee? $5,000. Cash.</i>

Tell me you've been naughty!

How bad?

Oh! Real bad!

Here it is!
You've got this!

Whoo!

Let's support each other
out there!

Mom! You're, like, so late.

I know. I'm sorry.
What did I miss?

Well, John Christopher scored.

Yes!
Yeah.


What are these?

College, mom.

Mr. Colson says we have
to start thinking early.

[Ms. Robbie]
That reminds me.

Yeah.

Raffle tickets.

Oh, thank you.
By the way...

the other moms are convinced
you just buy them up yourself.

Not true.
I never cheat!

I do things
fair and square.

Oh, wait...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

oh, oh, oh!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!


[all cheering]

Thank you.

looking for new girls,</i>

<i>and had my pick
of the best.</i>

<i>But the best
wasn't good enough.</i>

<i>They had to be unique.</i>

<i>Fresh.</i>

<i>Special.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

Have her come see me
when she gets a chance.

Thanks.

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>Even when
looking for new girls,</i>

<i>I made a point to take care
of my older ones.</i>

<i>We were a family,
after all.</i>

Hey.

Sit.

Anna, what's all this?

There's more.

Ohh.


Oh, my god. Anna.

You shouldn't have.

Here. Let me put it on.

You started working for me
five years ago today.

You were my first girl
to ever book a job

and you are still
my number-one girl.

To you.

To us.



Mm. This looks
good on me, right?

Really good.

about that waitress over there?

[â™ªâ™ª]

You can do better, Anna.

Hmm.

[â™ªâ™ª]

You wanted to see me?

Can I help you?

We can help each other.

Cassidy...

sit.

I'm...

I know.

I know who you are
and I think I know what you do.

You think?

People whisper about it.

I'm not judging.

It just seems so...


Everyone that you talk to

is so fancy.

Where're you from?
Spokane.

You're a terrible waitress.


Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

What do you want
in life, Spokane?

I'm still trying
to figure it out.

Well, you know what I do,

so let me work for you.

Me?


I... [laughs]

No.

I couldn't.

Squeamish? Shy?

No. No.
Drugs?

Boyfriend?

No.

You're perfect.

There's a few things

your mother probably
never told you, Spokane.

Being young and beautiful
is a privilege.

It doesn't last long,

but if you're smart,

you can cash in
and make it work for you.

Men make all the rules.

They get what they want
when they want it,

but there's always
one thing they want

that we don't have to give them.

We can make them pay for it.

Make the system work for us

and claim our little slice
of the American Dream.

How much money could I make?


[â™ªâ™ª]

Anna?

Simone Stepien.

You've heard of me
and I've heard of you.

Right.

Hi.

I think you and I could be

mutually beneficial
to each other.

If you're looking to expand
into the European market,

give me call.

I don't usually
work with other people.

Neither do I.

But in your case,
I'd make an exception.

Your reputation precedes you.

I'll be stateside again
in a few months.

Think about it,

and if you change your mind,
give me call.

The waitress...

I had my eye on her, too.

Excellent choice.

[â™ªâ™ª]

That's it?

It's the same as last month.

Slightly down
from the month before,

holding steady all year.

What's the problem?

The problem is,
is there's no growth, Art.

The business has been flat
for two years.

It's not good enough.

Simone Stepien approached me.

Anna.

Maybe it's time
to shake things up a little.

Arthur...

tell her no.

Why no? I've got clients who
travel to Europe all the time,

she's got clients
that travel here.

We could be mutually beneficial
to each other.

International clients
are tricky.

You got the DHS to worry about.

We don't know where
the money is coming from,

so if we slip up, you could be
dealing with real time.

Federal...
I would advise against it.

Me too.

Letty, you advise
against everything.

If I listened to you,
I'd still be wiping

you-know-what off the floor
of a rub-and-tug.

You know how much Harvard costs?
Penn? Yale?

Look, Mia's looking.

John Christopher's
gonna be 18 before we know it.

Scholarships, Anna.

I can't count on that,

and you try raising
two kids alone

Hell, I got a Sweet 16 that's
probably gonna cost me 30 grand.

My expenses are going up,
not down.

Just check her out.

If she's legit,

there's no harm
in having a conversation.

Anna, you're already rich.

What have I always told you?

No amount of money
is worth your freedom.


A little extra cash
wouldn't hurt anyone.

You know how my wife is.

Thanks.

Any time.

All right?

[â™ªâ™ª]


I need some advice, all right?

So I have this client...

he's rich, he's fly,
he ain't got no kids,

but he has the worst thing.

Long nails?
Nope.

A sweaty, hairy ass?
Girl, no.

It does start
with an "H" though.


Halitosis!

Ding-ding-ding-ding.
So what do I do?

Okay, ladies.

[â™ªâ™ª]

This is Cassidy.

Hi.

You hiring virgins now, Anna?

I'm not a virgin.

That's Vicky. Ignore her!

She's just jealous

because she's not
the fresh face anymore.

[women chuckling]

You got nice lips.

I'm gonna make them pop.

So what do I do
about his stank breath, though?

This is serious.

Mint trick.

What's that?

[â™ªâ™ª]

Like so.

<i>â™ª Calling out for answers</i>

<i>â™ª Now we finally know</i>

<i>â™ª That love makes the world
go 'round â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Forever we'll be dancin'</i>

<i>â™ª Turnin' every stone</i>


Whoo!

You know what happens next.

He'll be so distracted
by the tingling downstairs

that he won't have time
to be offended.

And when you make your way
back upstairs...

...minty fresh.

Yeah!
[laughter]

How did I not know
about this?

I don't know.

Did you know about this?

[â™ªâ™ª]

Wow.

I like it.

That's why they keep
calling for you, baby.

They pop.

â™ª I feel good
from my head to my toes â™ª

â™ª So I smile
everywhere that I go â™ª


<i>One happy family.</i>

<i>I took my business online</i>

<i>before most madams
ever thought of it.</i>

<i>We did glamour shots
like we were models</i>

<i>every few months,</i>

<i>and I'd rent out
the Presidential Suite</i>

<i>for the night,</i>

<i>which gave us all a chance
to catch up.</i>

<i>Everyone was doing well.</i>

<i>Tina had bought</i>

<i>some rental properties
in Florida.</i>

<i>Vicky had finished her MBA,
which I paid for.</i>

<i>Big Lola had plans
to open up a dungeon.</i>

<i>But we could always do better.</i>

Hey. Don't be nervous, okay?

I have the perfect
first job for you.

Don't worry.

There's none of that. Okay?

Ten minutes,
and you'll walk away

with two grand
in your pocket.

Okay, baby. We got you.

Looking good, mama.

Smile.

Two grand in 10 minutes?

What job is that?
"Halloweenie."

That's my client.

Was your client.

With your old ass.

Look, he requested
someone new, okay?

Happens all the time.
Don't take it personal.

[â™ªâ™ª]

She is going to make us
a lot of money.

a lot of money.

We're gonna give her a life
she never thought possible.

I like her.

She reminds me of me.


[â™ªâ™ª]

[eerie score plays]

Hello?

Is anyone there?

[eerie music plays]

Oh, gosh!

It's so creepy

and I'm all alone!

What's going on?

Someone?

Anyone?

I'm so scared!

I vant to suck
your bloo-oo-ood!


<i>Age 76.</i>

<i>He made his fortune
in early horror movies.</i>

<i>Net worth: 200 million.</i>

<i>Alias: Halloweenie.</i>

[shrieking theatrically]

Well?

How was it?

Good, I think.

Lunch is on you, Spokane.


I, uh, never forget a face...

...especially one that almost
put me in the hospital.

I didn't catch your name.
Owen.

Anna. Hi.

Hi.

Is that one yours?

Yeah.
She looks comfortable.

How long did that take?

Five years? Six, maybe.

My wife used to ride.

Before she passed,

I promised her
I'd get Emma into it.

My kid has no interest
in doing what Mom wanted.

She wants to play the violin.

What, she can't do both?

You ever heard an 8-year-old
play the violin?


Well, uh... here.

If you have any questions,

Mia could always
give Emma some pointers.

By the way, this is not
me hitting on you.

Oh, by the way,
that would be fine if it was.

[phone rings]

Sorry, I need to get this.

Sure.

Mark, how are you?

Are you sure you don't
want to reschedule?

[Mia screams]

Mia! Mia, are you okay?

Baby, are you okay?


Hey, hey. What's wrong, baby?
What's wrong?

Hey, you okay?

Is it your ankle?

Okay, here.
Let me help you up.

Come on.

Grab onto me, baby.


more pressure on me, baby.

Oh, well, now she hates horses.
Lovely.

It's a good thing
it's just a sprained ankle.

Mm.

Take a look.

Who's Meredith Prisker,

and why is she a third
of my party budget?

You need a DJ.

For seven grand,
I'll be the DJ.

Ow.
[phone rings]

This is Anna.

Anna, it's Dymitri.

<i>Dymitri.</i>

How are you?

<i>Dymitri Polokov, age 49.</i>

<i>Heir to an oil fortune</i>

<i>and son of a prominent member

<i>Net worth: 3.6 billion.</i>

<i>Alias: The Russian James Bond.</i>

Is everything all right?

<i>Everything is very good.</i>

So busy.

I need to cancel with Vicky.

She'll be sorry to hear that.

Give me a call
when things calm down.

What?

That was my third cancellation
for Vicky

in the past few days.

Third.

Who?

Strikeout, Cowboy,
and Russian James Bond.

Hi, Anna.

<i>Hey, Vicky.</i>

Sorry to call so late.
You have a minute?

Yeah, of course.
Well, I'm sorry

to do this to you,
but I, uh...

I have another cancellation
for you.

That's too bad.

<i>You know, maybe I should</i>

just take a vacation
for a few days.

<i>It's never a coincidence</i>

<i>when clients start canceling
one after the other...</i>

<i>especially when
they've booked the same girl</i>

<i>and don't reschedule.</i>

<i>I knew what was up.</i>

A vacation?
Yeah, you know what?

<i>You might as well, right?</i>

What's wrong?

She was my first girl.

My best girl.

We were in this
from the beginning

and this is what she does to me?

Well, she's not as young
as she used to be.

I'm sure she has her reasons.

I put her through college.

Okay.

Don't do anything crazy.

I need to make a point.

I mean, who the hell
does she think she is?

on Vicky's first condo</i>

<i>and had a set of back-up keys.</i>

<i>When I knew she'd be out,</i>

<i>I let myself in.</i>

<i>Just what I thought.</i>

<i>She was getting clients
to cancel with me,</i>

<i>seeing them anyway,</i>

<i>and taking all the money
for herself...</i>

<i>the classic workaround.</i>

<i>Bitch.</i>

<i>She also owed me 16 grand.</i>

<i>Rule number three?</i>

<i>Don't mess with my money.</i>

[phone rings]

This is Anna.

[line hangs up]

[dial tone buzzes]

All right, honey.

Lunch is served.

There you go. Make room.

["wind" breaks]
Oh!

[laughing]
What?

Very funny.

Out.

I need to talk to Letty.

If you want to know
about your party,

mm, I know nothing.


Is Mom okay?

How do you mean?

It just seems like maybe
she's having money problems

or something?

Your mother is always
on top of her money.

You won't ever
have to worry about that.

'Kay?

Yeah. Yeah.

But, like, it just seems weird

that she always has
so much cash laying around

and doesn't like banks.

Like, I know about the salon,

but what
is "head hunting"?

So, your mother matches
her clients with employers

based on need and talent.

Anna's fine.

I promise.

Okay?

Okay.

Sorry.

Sorry. You know how I am.

I do now.

What's that
supposed to mean?

Sit.

What's going on?

You tell me.


You were one of
my first "A"-list girls.

I hired you
when you were nothing.

I glammed you up.

I got you clients.

I treated you fair.

I made sure
you became somebody.

Why'd you burn me?

Anna, look, I can explain.

You know what?

I don't want to hear it.

Here's what's about to happen.

I took my cut,
fair and square.

The rest of your money's
in the bag.

From here on out,

you and me,

we're done.

Go with them.

Where?

Don't make a scene.

Have a little dignity.

Anna, please,
just let me explain.

I should've left you
and your cheap shoes

where I found you.

[Vicky sobs]

No, please.

Get out.

[â™ªâ™ª]

That looked dramatic.

[forced chuckle]

Do tell.

No...

-Come on.

Let's go.

Come on!

Take the money.

Don't kill me.

Shut up and listen.

Take the money.

The airport's a mile that way.

Get on a plane
and don't come back,

'cause, if you do,

there's gonna be a problem.

[door rumbles and thuds]

[â™ªâ™ª]

I think you made your point.

Oh, I did.

[both laughing]

is a lonely life,</i>

<i>everyone's your enemy,</i>

<i>but we were equals.</i>

That night,
Simone and I became friends.

<i>By closing time, we agreed</i>

<i>that if one of my regulars
was traveling to Europe,</i>

<i>Simone would handle it
and vice versa.</i>

<i>With Simone backing me up,</i>

<i>I was Don Corleone.</i>

So, what do you do for fun?

I took the kids to Orlando
last summer.

We did all the parks.

And then last year,
we went skiing.

Now I'm a working mom
and that feels right.

I like being valuable to people.

And I have
a pretty good group of girls,

for the most part.

At the salon?
Right.

At the salon, yes.

Well...

here we are.

What do you think?

I like it.

I couldn't tell you why,
but I... I do.

Thanks.

So you did this,
from top to bottom?

And everything in between.

Did I impress you?

Maybe.


This one is Emma's favorite.

Every time we drive past,
she points at it,

she says,
"That's Daddy's building."

That's pretty cool, you know?

When your kid's proud of you.

And hopefully, one day,
the grandkids'll know about it.

That's legacy.

Wow.

I really did impress you.

Want to take a closer look?

Yeah.

This is me.

We, uh,
we should do this again.

I'd invite you over,

but my son has just discovered
whoopee cushions

and you'd be a perfect target.

Well, next time.

Yeah.

Sorry.

It's, uh...

it's been a while.

I'm willing to give it a shot.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

[phone rings]

This is Anna.

[line hangs up]

[dial tone buzzing]

mean one of two things...</i>

<i>one, bad service.</i>

<i>Two, the Feds were onto me.</i>

<i>Now, I'd been careful,
but in the back of my mind,</i>

<i>I worried if
someone might be listening.</i>

Mom?

Is everything okay?

Everything's fine.

Would you tell me
if it wasn't?

[â™ªâ™ª]

[dance music thumping]

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª It's all play
or not at all â™ª

â™ª If you wanna
dance, dance, dance... â™ª

Hello, girls!

How are you?

Cake and presents
in five minutes.

What's with the attitude?

What's with your attitude?

You're the one
always sneaking around.

I'm gonna ignore that.

Presents. Go.

Hey, wow. This party...

how much is this
setting us back?

Why do you care?
We're doing better than ever.

Yeah, about that.

Jasmine's still
not returning calls.

Neither is Trish or Lucy.

Okay. I'll look into it.

Oh, and you still have to buy
raffle tickets from me.

Don't forget.
Right.

Yeah. I have the money.

Hey, Uncle Art, look at Wilbur.

Wow. Is that a tutu?


Okay, come here.
Let me see this.

You're crazy!

â™ª You look fabulous!

Thanks, mami.

So do you.

Thank you.

Okay, I gotta talk to you.

Why can't we all just
have a good time?

Come on.

Look. If it's about Simone,
I don't want to hear it. Okay?

What's done is done.

It's about Mia.

What about her?

You're gonna
have to tell her, Anna.

Tell her what?

About what you do.
Why would I do that?

she's been asking questions

and I can't keep lying for you.

Look. She's 16.
She's not stupid.

It's better
if it comes from you,

because if she figures
it out on her...

I'll think about it, okay?

Do more than think about it.

You tell her, or I will.

Jesus, Letty. Cake!

Just sayin'.

[phone rings]

This is Anna.

â™ª Happy birthday to you

Lola, hey, I really can't...

â™ª Happy birthday, dear Mia

â™ª Happy birthday...

I'll be right there.
Give me 20 minutes.

â™ª ...to you

[all cheering]



[all cheering]



This better be good.


<i>Robert Sanford, age 55.</i>

<i>Ran an international

<i>Net worth: 5.6 billion.</i>

<i>Alias: Mr. Cellophane.</i>

Tell Anna what you told me.

She left me tied to the chair

for two hours
while she went shopping

with my card.

So?

I got a bracelet for Mia

and a purse for you.

And I bought the Shakespeare
collection for myself.

<i>King Lear's</i>
always been my favorite.

And I got room service.

All the room service.

Strawberries?

I want my money back.

Were you bad, Bob?
Did you disobey Mistress?

He was nine minutes late.

Mistress was displeased.

He had to be punished.

I'm not paying for this!

You're absolutely right.

You're paying double.

You broke the rules,

you were disrespectful
to Mistress,

and you got me out of
my kid's Sweet 16 party.

You know how often a Sweet 16
happens in a kid's life, Bob?

Once.

Exactly. So double, plus tip.

And I don't care
if she leaves you

tied up like this
till morning.

Do we understand each other?

Mm-hmm.

Apologize to your mistress.

I'm sorry, Mistress.

And you're also buying
100 raffle tickets

to support the Eastside Eagles.

Are we clear?

Mm-hmm.

He's all yours, Lola.

[tires screeching]

Mom?

Why aren't you in bed?

Why are you sneaking around?

What's up with you lately?

You just had an amazing
Sweet 16 party.

You missed
the last half of it.

I had an emergency at work.

With "head-hunting"?
Yes.

What was it?

A client wasn't happy
and didn't want to pay.

That couldn't wait
until Monday?

That's the business.

What do you want me to do?

It just paid for your party
now, didn't it?

You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Mom?

Mia, what is this?

Why can't you just say no?

No. I wouldn't lie to you.

Go to bed.


Here you go.
Hey.

[bill counter clacking]

Have you gotten
any dropped calls recently?

-A few. Why?

So have I.
Me too.

It's not good, Anna.


It's the girls, too...
Jasmine, Trish, Lucy.

Word on the street

is they're getting poached.

By who?

Don't know.
Someone who's new to the game.

And they're not only
taking the girls,

they're taking the clients,

and they're marking
their territory.

I think it's...

What?

Time.

Might be time to get out, Anna.

No!

No! Why are you even
talking like that?

How many times
do I have to say it?

No amount of money
is worth your freedom,

and listen to your gut.

When things get weird,

it's the universe telling you
it's time.

No.

No, I'm not
gonna be intimidated.

What kind of message
does that send?

That you're smart.

That I'm scared!

If I have to dangle someone else
out the window, I will.

Anna.
We are business as usual.

Letty, go into the city
and start asking around.

See what you can find out
about whoever's messing

with my bottom line.

Arthur, if you're spooked,
we can reroute websites,

start another LLC,
and pause deposits.

Happy?

Okay.


<i>I could feel it.</i>

<i>Kids know
when you're lying to them,</i>

<i>and if they can't trust you,
they resent you.</i>

Put that away.

I want to talk to you
about something.

You know that,
ever since Dad died,

I work very hard

to provide for you
and your brother, right?

And I love you both
so much.

How would you feel
if I told you that I...

That you...?


...Have a boyfriend.

That's it?

That's it.

Are you sure
there's nothing else?

That's it, kiddo.

I'd be happy for you, Mom.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[phone rings]

This is Anna.

[line hangs up]

[dial tone buzzing]

[Anna sighs]

[phone rings]


Anna. It's me.
Are you okay?

Yeah. Yeah,
I just got a little spooked.

I have good news and bad news.

The good news is, I found out
who's poaching your girls.

Who is it?

That's the bad news.

It's Vicky.

I realized Letty was right.</i>

<i>I'd made a mistake.</i>

<i>Gone too far.</i>

<i>I had to be smarter.</i>

Anna?

You did good.

I'll take care of it.

<i>I don't want</i>

any part
of your "taking care" of it.

Anna, now might be
a really good time

to consider getting...

<i>We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

[car tires screeching]

[engine rumbles]

Who are you?

Who sent you?

You think you can scare me?

You think you can
show up at my house?

Mom?

What the hell?

[groans and sighs]

Are you drunk?

No.

Get outta here before I call
the cops, you little creep.

Inside. Now.

Since when do you drink?

I had a wine cooler.

Big deal.

And who was that guy?

A boy who's my friend.

So now you have
a secret boyfriend?

It's better than
a secret life.

What's that supposed to mean?

You think I'm stupid?

You don't just run a salon.

Marty's dad's a head-hunter,

and he has an office

and normal business hours

and doesn't always
pay for things in hundreds.

I know
what you do for a living.

What is it
that you think I do?

Ask away.

20 questions. Go.

Are you a millionaire?
Yes.

Are you paid in cash?

Yes.

Is what you do legal?

No.

If someone found out,
could you go to jail?

Don't lie.

Yes.

Are you a drug dealer?

What?

Listen to me, Mia.
I am not a drug dealer.

Okay?
I would never do that.

Then what?

I'm a madam.

[â™ªâ™ª]


[sighs heavily]

Okay, so...

<i>After she'd calmed down,</i>

<i>I started at the beginning
and told her everything...</i>

<i>from "Enema Man"</i>

<i>to "Russian James Bond".</i>

<i>I didn't want to lose her.</i>

<i>She deserved the truth.</i>

<i>Coming clean to her</i>

<i>was the second biggest gamble
of my life.</i>

Take the money.

So what do you think?

Honestly?

I kinda think it's cool.

[Mia laughs]

Oh!

But if it's illegal
and you get caught,

what happens to us?

I won't get caught.

No one ever thinks
they're gonna get caught

and then they do.

What would we do without you?

It's not gonna happen.

How do you know?

Is there something else
you could do?


Okay, let's make a deal.

I will look into a new career,

if you get back on the horse...
literally.

Deal?

Deal.


<i>I had to take care of a problem

<i>[door buzzer ringing]</i>

<i>I found out

Oh, wonderful! Okay. Great.

Thank you so much for supporting
the Eastside Eagles.

Raffle tickets, guys!

Hey! Hey-hey. How many?

[â™ªâ™ª]



[dark theme plays]

Let me go!

[Cassidy cries out
as blows land]

Let me go!

Look at that "D"! Defense!

Whoo-whoo!

Let's go, guys!
Come on! Teamwork!

Come on! You got this!

You're quiet.
You all right?

No, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just... Everything's good.

Come on, John Christopher!
Let's go, baby!

Let's go.
Come on!

Let's go, let's go!

Let's go.

Go. Go, go, go. Go... whoo!

Oh, yeah! Yes!


[all cheering]

Whoo-hoo!

Yeah!

Whoo!

[phone rings]

Hey, Cass. How'd it go?

Cassidy, are you okay?

[â™ªâ™ª]

That son of a bitch.

Keep it down, Anna.

I'm sorry!
It's just that son of a bitch!

He didn't seem
like the type to...

I can't go back to my place.

You can stay here

for as long as you need, okay?

You know we can't go
to the cops, right?

I-I know.

But I promise you,

he is being dealt with
as we speak

and this will never
happen again, okay?


[Anna sighs]

I'm sorry.

Go ahead.
Let me have it.

I deserve it.

This is on you.

You don't think I know that?

I'm going to make it right.

Well, you can do it without me.

What's that supposed to mean?

15 years in the business,

and I never had a man
put a hand on one of my girls!

You almost had
one shoot up the place,

or did you forget that?

I quit.

You can't quit,

because I already fired you!

[door slams]


["Versailles" cries out]

What's wrong with you?


[â™ªâ™ª]

No. That's priceless.
You can't do that!


So, what do you think?

Can we afford it?

It's a stretch,

but I think
I can make the numbers work.

But this is good.
Really good.

Whatever happened to the girl

scrubbing the floors
after Enema Man paid us a visit?


She's going legit.

I'm proud of you.

Thanks.

You're gonna buy this?

Sure. Why not?

Consider it an investment.

And after you graduate
from college,

you can come help me.

This will all be yours
and your brother's one day.

Your legacy.

Let's do it.

<i>[Anna] So there I was,</i>

<i>on my way to becoming</i>

<i>a commercial real estate
developer,</i>

<i>and I had to admit,
coming clean and going legit,</i>

<i>it felt good...</i>

<i>but there was still
one person I was lying to.</i>

Home?
Work.

Salon's open late.

Other work.

Right. Head-hunting.

You get calls this late?

Sometimes, yeah.

Is that a good thing?

I mean, is it, uh...

with this whole honesty thing,</i>

<i>and after all, I mean,
how bad could his reaction be?</i>

<i>But I still couldn't tell him.</i>

<i>That was a gamble
I just wasn't willing to take.</i>

<i>We still had a shot
at our happily-ever-after.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>I was all in...</i>

<i>the third-biggest gamble
of my life.</i>

<i>$30,000 a month mortgage,</i>

<i>$30,000 a year
in property tax alone.</i>

<i>But I wasn't
out of my business just yet.</i>

<i>I couldn't just walk away
from the business I'd built.</i>

<i>My girls depended on me.</i>

<i>They needed me.</i>

<i>It was imperative</i>

<i>that I leave them
in good hands,</i>

<i>and there was only
one woman for the job.</i>

Wow.

It's a lot...
it's a lot of responsibility,

but I wouldn't be asking you

if I didn't think
you could do it,

and if I didn't think it'd be
beneficial to the both of us.

You're really getting out?

For the kids.

Mia especially.

Do you remember
what you told me once?

"They get what they want
whenever they want,

but there's one thing
they always want

that we don't
have to give them.

We can make them pay for it."

Even then,
they can just take it...

you left that part out.

I know.

I'm not saying yes,
but I'm not saying no, either.

I just...
I need to think about it.

Take all the time.

Okay.

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo! Yeah, Mia!

Yes! Yes, Mia!

[horse huffs]
Whoa.

You did it.
How does it feel?

Good.

Why don't you go again,
just to make sure?

Okay, Mom.

How's your stuff?

Are you officially out?

I'm working on it.

I'm gonna worry
until you are.

I know.

Go!

Tch-tch.

Good boy.


<i>and I still hadn't
heard from Cassidy.</i>

<i>I'd almost given up on her</i>

<i>and was looking to ask
another girl when...</i>

[phone rings]

Hey, Cass.

How are you?

<i>She was in,</i>

<i>which meant I was out.</i>

<i>Word got out
about my purchase</i>

<i>and, suddenly, I was more than</i>

<i>just the owner of a nail salon
and a soccer mom.</i>

<i>I was legit.</i>

<i>Respected.</i>

<i>Someone to look up to.</i>

And our award
for most valuable player

goes to...
John Christopher.


Great job!

Whoo-hoo!

As always, we want
to recognize the Eagle parent

who sold the most raffle tickets
this season.

Anna, come on up here.


Come get your trophy.


Hey, kiddo.

Why are you so happy?

I'm out.

Officially?

I just made my last call
a few minutes ago.

Cassidy's taking over,

and if she needs help,
Arthur's standing by.

Congratulations, Mom.

I'm so proud of you.

[â™ªâ™ª]

So... everything's okay?

Better than okay.

<i>[television program plays]</i>

Anna, can we talk?

No, Arthur.
No business.

Okay? If Cass has a problem,
she needs to handle it herself.

That's how I learned,
that's how she's gonna learn.

Right, but...
No buts.

Real estate stuff only, Arthur.

I mean it.

[reporter] <i>Breaking news...</i>
Okay.

Mom! Come quick.

<i>...moments after opening.</i>

<i>The Dow Jones has fallen

What's up?

<i>...the largest drop in history,
and more losses...</i>


<i>All my money, all of it,
was tied up in my real estate.</i>

<i>Now all of my assets
were underwater.</i>

<i>Just when I thought I was out,
I was pulled back in,</i>

<i>but I couldn't tell Mia.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

hadn't crashed in 2008,</i>

<i>I would have been
a wealthy, legal land developer.</i>

<i>Not only was I on the hook
for a massive mortgage,</i>

<i>no one was buying
or building,</i>

<i>which meant I had
no source of income,</i>

<i>so I had to go back
to what I knew.</i>

Hi.

My name's Melody.

You know, like,
the best part of the song?

Right.
The melody.

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>But even though
my instincts warned against it,</i>

<i>I was willing
to give her a chance.</i>

Am I?

Do you want to have fun?

All right. Let's do this.

Damn, girl!

Ho, ho!


Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

You okay?

I'm great!

You are great.

<i>Things weren't going well.</i>

Melody, stop!

Stop!

Stop it!

Calm down!

What?

Mom?

Is everything okay?

Just busy.

Did you find any investors yet?

Still working on it,
but they are out there.

And you're not doing
the other thing?

I said I wouldn't,
and I'm not, okay?

It's tough times
for everyone right now,

but we'll be fine, okay?

Do not worry.

[â™ªâ™ª]


What's this?

Investment opportunity.

For who?

Me.

You're kidding.

Why not?

You're better than this.


Not everyone grew up upstate
with both their parents

and graduated high school
and got to go to college.

Some of us got kicked out
and were on the streets at 15.

Some of us had to make a living
the best way we knew how

to provide for ourselves
and our kids

after our husbands
crash into a median

and get thrown
through a windshield.

Whoa.
Where is this coming from?

Sorry.

interactive, exclusive.</i>

<i>A premier dating site
for men and women.</i>

<i>All I needed
was $2 million in seed money.</i>

<i>And the best part?
Totally legal.</i>

<i>If I played my cards right,</i>

<i>Mia would never know
I broke my promise.</i>

<i>I called Arthur</i>

<i>and he arranged for us to meet
with a pair of investors.</i>

My business has always been

about catering
to the most exclusive clients.

As Arthur can tell you,

I turned a profit
with my first business

within the first two months,

and I expect
I can do even better here.

We like it.

A lot.

They better be legit, Arthur.

They are.
Well, you need to be sure

because I don't
want to be knee-deep

in Russian hooker drug money.

My kids are counting on me
not to keep messing up.

I know that.
You don't think I know that?

Your kids
are like my kids, Anna.

Look. Look.

We got a 10:00 a.m.
at the bank tomorrow

to transfer the funds.

These guys are the real deal.

I promise.

I...

What?

What is up with you lately, Art?

Nothing. No.

It's just everything.
It's a lot.

Yeah. Uh...

This is gonna work.

It's legit.
We're gonna be fine.

We better be

or it's your ass.

I know.

See you tomorrow.

<i>When I woke up that morning,</i>

<i>I knew something was wrong,</i>

<i>but I couldn't quite
put my finger on what it was.</i>

[sighs heavily]

You look nice.

Thank you.

And you'll be back in time
for the meet, right?

Absolutely. Should be back
before noon, okay?

I love you.

And I love you, too.

Ooh! Learn something
today, okay?

Okay.

[Anna chuckles]

Bye.
Bye.

<i>No one showed at the bank,</i>

<i>not even Arthur,</i>

<i>who wasn't answering my calls.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

Help!

Somebody help!
I'm being kidnapped!

Somebody!


<i>my last day on Earth.</i>

<i>I prayed my kids
would be okay without me.</i>

<i>But I wasn't going
without a fight.</i>

<i>I didn't know where I was,</i>

<i>where they'd taken me.</i>

<i>Was this it?</i>

<i>A bullet
to the back of the head</i>

<i>and then nothing?</i>

Sit down! Sit down.

Well, you're a giant pain
in my ass.

[â™ªâ™ª]


Like I said
a thousand times already,

I don't know
what you're talking about.

I want to speak to my lawyer

and then I want
to get the hell out of here.

My kid has a meet at 5:00.

About your lawyer.

What about him?

We've already spoken to him.

We've... been speaking to him.

For months now.

And a woman named Melody.
Get it?

Art?

Yes.


<i>right when
I had almost gone straight.</i>

<i>He was family...</i>

<i>the first person
who had ever believed in me.</i>

<i>I think he'd been trying
to tell me in his own way,</i>

<i>but I didn't listen.</i>


I want my phone call.

Now.

Anna...

help us help you.

You don't have counsel,

which means its gonna take us
at least 24 hours

to assign you
a public defender.

That means you're gonna be
in Rikers for an entire night.

Is that what you want?

I want my phone call.

We're not unreasonable.

We just have a few questions
about some of your clients.

At the salon?

Why do you want
to know about people

who get their toenails done
and their upper lips waxed?

You give us answers

and maybe we can get you
to your meet on time.

You abducted me off the streets
in broad daylight.

You didn't read me my rights.

Why should I believe
anything that you say?

What do you know
about these people?

Take your time.

<i>They were all there...</i>

<i>all my clients
over the last five years...</i>

Amber Alert, Big Pharma,
Russian James Bond.

I knew I was about
to get effin' hammered.

I don't know
any of these people.

Sorry.
Rikers, then?

[crowd applauds]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Letty, it's me.

The eagle has landed.

[voice breaks]
Take care of the kids, okay?

[prisoners hooting and jeering]

Hey, Martha Stewart.
What'd you do? Rob a Saks?

[woman cackling]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Hey.

We're gonna be okay, okay?

Where's Mia?

No one?



<i>No one had returned
Letty's calls for my bail.</i>

<i>Not Simone.
Not Owen. Not Cassidy.</i>

<i>None of my clients.</i>

Well, there's plenty of money.

They took it

in the raid, Anna.

All of it.

There's nothing left.

[â™ªâ™ª]


<i>I was pretty sure
I was going away for life,</i>

<i>unless I cooperated.</i>

<i>But there's
a thing called honor.</i>

<i>I wasn't going to ruin
anyone else's life.</i>

<i>Five months...
that's how long they held me.</i>

<i>As it turns out,
I really wasn't the target.</i>

<i>My clients were.</i>

<i>Finally,
I was offered a plea deal.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

[shutters snapping]

[â™ªâ™ª]

<i>I was sentenced to time served
and released.</i>

<i>I may have looked free,
but I wasn't.</i>

<i>The money was gone.</i>

<i>I was all over the local news,</i>

<i>and the moment
I stepped outside,</i>

<i>there were a dozen reporters
trying to get my picture.</i>

<i>So I couldn't leave the house.</i>

<i>Letty came
to get John Christopher,</i>

<i>and, finally,
it was just Mia and me.</i>

Where are you going?

I'm going to stay with Letty.

What do you care?

I care
because I'm your mother.

I don't have a mother.

How could you say that?

You said you were out.

I was! I-I tried.

You lied.

Maybe you shouldn't have been

a frigging madam
in the first place.

What's wrong with you?

I did my best, Mia.

It wasn't good enough.

You ruined everything...

this house, riding lessons.

My Sweet 16!

But who cares?

None of that matters.

We could've been living
in a box somewhere

and that would've been
better than all this.

At least we would have
all been together.

Now everything's gone.

Mia, I did my best.

And it's your fault!

And I'm never
speaking to you again.

Mia?

[Mia sobs]


a breakdown looks like.</i>

<i>I didn't know
where I was going.</i>

<i>I just knew
I had to go somewhere,</i>

<i>to start over.</i>


<i>I drove all night,</i>

<i>and then, there it was,
a pig rescue farm.</i>

<i>I spent 14 months
at a rescue pig farm</i>

<i>as a live-in volunteer,
off the grid in Pennsylvania.</i>

<i>Who would have even thought
to look for me there?</i>

<i>That's where
I got my sanity back.</i>

<i>And every day,
I called my daughter.</i>

Mia?

Mia, are you there?

<i>She never answered</i>

<i>until that one day
when she did.</i>


you don't have to talk,
but if you'll, uh...

you'll just listen.

<i>Look, I know "sorry"
isn't a big enough word.</i>

I won't even bother saying it.

I just... I want you to know

I love you so much

and I am...

I am so proud of you.

<i>So...</i>

<i>my phone will always be on.</i>

If you call, day or night,

I swear I will pick it up.

Maybe one day
you can forgive me.

I miss you, kiddo.
