The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

saw deeply into life.

People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

Sorry.

Mr. Townsend.

Just this way.

So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

Yeah, so I see.

Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

You have to really want it.

Not that I have their talent.

Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

And you want to live in London?

Very much. Very much.

We have a very
exclusive membership here.

You can begin this weekend?

Thank you. Thank you very much.

That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

You can just open it up, get your kip.

Kitchen just through there.

All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

All that stuff.

Lovely view, not overlooked.

So it's all good.

This is 225 a week?

Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

No, no, no.
The geezer who was in here before,

he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

I'll take it.
That's a good choice.

Very good.

Ohris Wilton.

This is Tom Hewett.

Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
Morning. Pleasure.

I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

Don't worry, it comes back.

What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

OK.

Well, good luck.
Thank you very much.

Over here.
Brilliant.

OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

They were both great.
Yeah, I know, but I mean,

you held your own more than admirably.

For a while.

But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

Actually, I'll get this.
No, no, no, no.

No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
No, no, no, no, no.

Get your dirty great forehand off.

Thank you. I'll get the next one.

So, do you need a lift after this?

Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some ODs.

Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

And they'll have a decent opera section?

Opera? You like opera, really?

I love opera.

Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Oovent Garden.

I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

To the opera?

Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

It's La bloody Traviata.

My God. I'd love to.

Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

So?

I said to David and Melissa...
Evening all. Hello, Mum.

Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

This is Ohris. This is my father Alec.
Hello. Good to meet you.

I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

then I went back
Rubbish.

I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
I just got bored.

Good evening. My pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

This is my sister... Chloe.
There's a chair somewhere.

I'm Ohloe. Nice to meet you.
There's two more.

Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

Frighteningly so at times. But...

Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

Ohlo-Ohlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Ohris for a bit?

It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

It'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Ohop-chop.

Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

I'm so bad.
That's how you get better.

Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

OK.

Was I dreadful?

Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

It all came so easy at first.

Do you enjoy teaching?
Not really.

I mean, it's OK for now,

but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

I'd like to do something with my life.

You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

I love it.

It's so exciting and alive.

I've never seen so much art or theater.

Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

That'd be great.

On one condition: I buy the tickets.

Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

But actually,
I did read something about the...

...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

You're very kind to offer this.

Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

OK, it's a deal.

How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

I can do that.

Shall we meet for lunch first?
It's a date.

I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

So who's my next victim?

You?

I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

What did I walk into?

What did I walk into?

It's like this.

May I?
Please.

You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

The story of my life.

So, tell me,

what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

mingling amongst
the British upper class?

Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

Extremely aggressive.
I'm naturally competitive.

Is it off-putting?

I'll have to think
about that for a while.

There you are.

I wanted to introduce you
to Ohris Wilton.

Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fianc√©e.

So, you're the tennis pro.

Hello, darling.
My pleasure.

He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

He's made a living out of hustling.

I'll be ready for you next time.

I'll see you outside.
Oh, yeah.

She's quite something, isn't she?

How long have you been together?
Six months.

Jesus, yeah, six months!

She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

...one thing led to another.

Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

that I'm serious about her, but...

To be honest with you,

Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

Especially an American one.

But I am crazy about her.

Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

I'd love to.
Excellent.

Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

Why not.
Lead on. Quickly.

These afternoons have been great.

I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

Yes, it's fun.

Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

Do you need money?

God, no.

No, I'm fine.

It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

I'm only asking
because I care about you.

Shall we go to your place or mine?

I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

Yeah. He's very nice.
I liked him.

I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

Well, I find him very likeable.

He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

Can't we do something for him?

A place in one of
your companies or something?

Has he expressed a desire?

No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

He really wants
to make something of his life.

Chloe, be careful.

Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

She's spoilt and temperamental.

She's an actress, they're emotional.

She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

Who are you talking about?
Nola.

Have you been waiting ages?
Hello. Not at all.

Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

Did you say anything?

Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

You're not cross, are you?
God, no.

It's extremely thoughtful of you.

Thanks.

What do you think?

I'm gonna have to think about it.

I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

I don't know, really.

I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

I think it is.

Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

...you move up quickly, or whatever.

I've always felt so-so
about office work.

It's not exactly office work.

Think of it more as a stepping stone.

To?

To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

greater earning potential, I don't know.

You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

Of course.

I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

I've always admired
men like your father.

Wealthy, but not stuffy.

Enjoying his fortune.

Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

He's a very generous man.

He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

You don't seem very enthusiastic.
I'm sorry.

I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

I will. I promise.

Oh, good.
Hello.

Hi, guys.

Hello.

Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExOeL.

Really?
It was unbelievable.

I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

Oh, God. Shut up.

You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

I think the old ones are beautiful.
Yeah, I like the old ones.

But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

I want an Aston Martin.

I drove an Aston Martin.
Really?

Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

He was very, very particular about
Thank you.

Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

In fact, speaking of Hedley...
Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
I'd like the same, please.

Nothing to start?

Oh, I think the wine list.

I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

Roast chicken.
God, boring!

Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

You should try them.
That's OK.

No, do you like caviar?
So-so.

"So-so."

He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

He'll have the blinis.

My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

He was kind of austere.

Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

Oh, Christ.

After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

What were you saying about Hedley?

Papa's invited us for some shooting.
Oh, really?

I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

True.
Have you done many movies?

It was a commercial, not a movie.

But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

Oh, you just need a break.

I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

Oh, hard work is mandatory,

but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

I mean, it seems scientists are...

...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

No purpose, no design.

Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

And I envy you for it.

What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

Oh, God.
Oh, God.

Oan we change the subject, please?

Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

No, I was...

...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

Not that I'm ever
going back to Oolorado.

Ever.

Have you decided on a wine?

Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

Good morning. Chris Wilton.
Rod Carver.

Good morning. Chris Wilton.
Rod Carver.

Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

Hi, Alan. How are you?

At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

It's basically nine to five.
Yes, yes.

So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

Now, if you're OK with the package,

we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

Good to meet you, Alan.
Good. And you.

And Rod.

I'm sure you'll be happy here.
I'm sure I will.

Exciting things are happening.
OK.

I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

It's such good news.

Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

Wow. Thank you.

Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

...uninspiring.
It's very rare.

It has some beautiful arias on it.

And his voice expresses

everything that's tragic about life.

You find it tragic, do you?
And you?

I love it.

Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

Puligny-Montrachet.

I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

Now I'm addicted.

Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

but I told them we're busy.

But we have no plans.

Well, no special plans.

I thought we said we'd stay in?

Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

We could've joined them.

We still can, if you'd prefer it.

It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

Well, shall I call them?

I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

Well...

It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

The wine, the opera.

Absolutely.

I just figured...

We can stay in any... any night, and...

...they're free and suggested a film.

What's the film?

I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

I am in the mood for a film.

Thank you so much, fella.

Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

Hello, sweetie.
Hi, guys. One second.

There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

Good luck with the Sky Blues.
Oh, yeah, cheers.

Where is she?

Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
But she sends her love.

Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
I bet that was her choice.

I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

Everybody likes you at work.

Papa says he's heard great things.

You're a very clever boy.

Hey!

Hey.

Hi.
How are you?

What are you doing here?
I was just looking for a sweater.

The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

It's vicuna.

Vicuna.
Vicuna?

Yeah.
Right.

Where are you going?

Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

Why?
So...

Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

Don't worry, you'll be great.
Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

Are you walk? You wanna walk?
Yeah, sure.

My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

Yes. That would be great. If you...
Sure.

If it's not a problem.
It's not a problem.

No, it's not a problem.
OK.

I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

Have you ever tried yoga?

No.
No?

Hi.

Hello. Hi.
Oh, hey.

How was it?
Blew that.

Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

...in the end.
You will. You will.

Yeah.

You know what,

I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

...a little bit.
Sure.

OK.
This way.

What was I saying?

My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

You should see my sister, she's...

...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

My sister...

...is classically beautiful.

So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

It's just a joke.

What did your father do?

He... left.

And never sent any money.

And my mother
could never hold down a job.

No?
No.

Her problem was that she drank.

How did you meet Tom?

We met at a party.

He...

...saw me across the room

and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

And I...

I liked him right off, you know.

I thought...

Well, I think he's very handsome.

Don't you?

Very.

And he asked you to marry him?

Well, he...

...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

What did I know
about that kind of life?

I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Oolorado.

But...

I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

Who?
Eleanor. Tom's mother.

She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

It's such an inbred family. It's...

And was it love at first sight
for you too?

I thought he was very handsome.

You know, and I told you I was just...

I was overwhelmed with attention.

So, what about you and Ohloe?

She's very sweet.

She is very sweet.

And she wants to marry you.

I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

No. No, it's different.

I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

...are being groomed.

You mark my words.

They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

But...

You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

And how am I going to blow it?

By making a pass at me.

And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

Men always seem to wonder.

They think I'd be
something very special.

And are you?

Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

I've had too much to drink.

Can you get me a cab?

Sure.

Thank you.

You were driving a bit fast,

weren't you?
Good morning.

Which one is he in?
Second one over there.

Oh, hi.

So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

Oh, he's so sweet.

The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

It should have dissipated fully already.

Tom, can I feed him?
Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

You're so beautiful.

What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

that the company would pay for?

I don't know.

I've had very good
feedback on your work.

And the beginning of next year

there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

Plus, there are a number of perks...

Expense account, driver, et cetera.

We had been focusing on someone else...

...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

I'd hate to disappoint you.

Oh, excuse me.
Oome on, Ohris...

We're nearly ready.

I'll bring a gun for Ohris.
Thanks, Tom.

Never mind, fella.

This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

But it's bloody good fun.
Don't frighten him.

His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

Don't you worry, Chris.
Quite right, Papa.

Come on, Chloe.

Hi, darling.

Have you seen my Strindberg book?

No.

How did your audition go?

Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

So, how long do you keep it up?

How long?

Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

To try something else?

I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

I'm not saying that.

All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

Well, I do ask myself that.

See? It's only logical, Tom.

Especially for a woman.

It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

and as you get older and time passes,

if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

I'm not saying now.

But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

...innuendos.

All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

Those that have it, know it right off.

To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

Excuse me.

Nola.

It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

I was looking for you.

I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

I don't mean to intrude.

I need a drink.

I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

Do I?
Yeah.

Oonfident.
I don't think this was a good idea.

You shouldn't have followed me here.

Do you feel guilty?

Do you?

We can't do this.

I know.

This can't lead anyplace.

Hello.

Darling, I think it's for you.

But take it outside.

Well, there's hope, at least.

When's the callback?

Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

Yeah. OK.

Bye.

Why have you been so cold to me?

I haven't been cold.
Yes, you have.

Ever since we came back
from the countryside

you've been distant, evasive.

I don't want to encourage anything.

What happened, happened, Chris.

I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

Oh, stop rationalizing.
I'm not rationalizing.

Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

We had our moment.

But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

Chris, forget it. It's over.

Thanks. Henry!

Hey. How are you?
Chris. All right.

Look at you.
Good to see you.

Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

Thanks.
You still doing the tennis tour?

Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

I just couldn't stand it.

No. No, I heard you went into business.

I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

A big wheel.
It's who you know, Henry.

I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

Family's got nothing but money.

Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

Hey, look, I understand.

It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

I always admired
your game though, you know?

Thanks.
You were very steady.

Cool under pressure, but creative.

You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

I lost to you as much as I beat you.

No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

Listen, can I buy you lunch?

That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

Give me your number.
Oertainly.

I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

You should call me anytime.
Very impressive.

So good to see you, Henry.

You look well.
And you, mate.

You look very, very well.
I can buy us lunch.

Put it on the expense account, so...
Very well.

...do call.
Very good. Yeah, yeah.

All right.
Bye.

Oh, my God.
Right there.

She's got glasses on.
But why on earth?

Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

The supermarket?
Yes.

Can you play the piano?
No, I'm terrible at the piano.

So, when are you two getting married?
Mummy!

Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
Oh, don't look so surprised.

Stop it.

You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

Mummy, come with me.
Oh, dear.

You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

I appreciate that.

Darling, one second.
I just think we...

You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

It was all her fault, you know.

Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

All men who see you want to attack you.

Isn't that right, Ohristopher?

Oh, God, are you all right?

I'm fine.

I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

I now pronounce you man and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

Oh, my God.

This is incredible.
Isn't it?

What's up here?
That's the bedroom.

There's another bedroom through there.

The bathroom and a kitchen.

Little terrace.
Wow.

But look at this view.
Oh, it's breathtaking.

I just... wish I could afford it.
Oh, don't bring that up again.

You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

Come on.
The light coming through every day.

It's beautiful. But it's huge!

I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
Really?

Yeah.
That could be a problem.

I want you to make me pregnant.

Chloe... We discussed this.

It's very quick.

It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

Hey! Where are you?

I know, I know. I'm sorry.

Not good.

Listen, I've got to tell you something.

What?

Well, Nola and I...

...broke up.

No!
Yeah.

Or, I should say, I called it off.

I thought you were gonna get married.

Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

who's her main candidate.

God, no.

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

...I've met someone else.

No!
Yeah.

I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

You know what I mean.

The number you are calling
is not available.

The number you are calling
is not available.

Excuse me.

Are you looking for Miss Rice?
Yes.

She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

Did she say where?
Not to me.

Thanks.
That's all right.

What are you thinking about?
Nothing.

Just business.

You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

Am I being rejected?
Of course not.

OK, I can take a hint.

Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

Look...

...it'll happen.

I'm just really tired.

Kiss.

Sweet dreams.

I now pronounce you man and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

I know.

We've tried everything.
What about this?

His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

Yeah, I don't like it.
No.

Would you ever consider adopting?
No, absolutely not.

I want my own children.

This one?

Sort of...

Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

Really?

She's so happy.
Whoa.

Her and her husband
just found each other.

All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

and itjust works like a charm.

After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

God...
I know, it's great.

Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

If I have to work all night.

OK.

Thank you. Thanks.

Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

Thanks.

Are you OK, sir?

Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

No, not really.

Oh, Christ!

I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

Not before.

Good night.

Chris.
Oh, I was looking for you.

Hi, Carol.
Hi, Chris.

How are you, darling?
Good.

They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

Yeah?

I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

Oh, yes.
Look, where are you going to be?

Why?

I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

I'm coming.

OK.
OK.

Hello.

What a surprise.

I...

I moved back into town.
I didn't know you'd left town.

Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

I thought you hated that place?
Anyplace but here.

I looked for you.

For what?

You're still so angry.

Where are you living?

In town. Why?

You live alone?

Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

Can I meet you for a drink?

Talk?

Where can I reach you? Oome on.

My goodness. Hello.
Hi, darling.

Look who I bumped into.

Hi.
Hi.

How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

You look great.
Thanks.

How's Tom?
He's fine.

Really well.
Yeah, I heard he got married.

Yeah. They've got a baby.

You know Tom, all settled down.

OK, I think I've found it.
Do you two know each other?

This is my friend Oarol.
This is Nola.

Hi.
Hi.

We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

Say your phone number.

What's the point?
Just say your phone number.

Chris...
Please.

Say your phone number.

02079460996.

I'll call you.

Bye.

I think he really knows
what he's doing.

Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

It's OK, John.

I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

I'll drop you.
No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

OK.
See you at home.

Bye.

You have a very charming flat.

The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

I mean, it's not perfect.

The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

...woman down the hall has mice, but...

...you know, the lobby's decent.

The key word is it's cheap.

What time is it?

Time for you to go.

It's so hard to leave you.

Beautiful woman.

How'd you sleep?

Good.

God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

about that earthquake in China?

Terrible.

And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

an entirely new planet.
Yeah?

Yeah.

I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

Papa's getting so into the idea.

It should be good for you.

I've got to go to work.
Oh, really?

I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

...before you went to work.

It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

Darling, I'm gonna be late.
Come on, it'll be fun.

Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

Let me come up.

We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.
