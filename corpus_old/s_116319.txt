It's Mojo Radio back on the air.
Slammin'Sammy here.

Football time in Texas.
Let's go to the phone.
We got, uh, Butch on the line with us.

Butch, what about it?
We'll have a great year, or what?

 How you doin'?
 Good, Butch.
Tell me about this season.

 We're gonna
have a hell of a season this year.!
Winchell's gonna take us all the way.

Deep slant tripps stacked right?
Primary receiver's inside flanker.

"Z" burst.
My linemen are an 80 pass block.

How deep is your drop?
Five steps.

Five steps.
Tripps stacked left?

I nside eight-yard curl.
You gonna get a scholarship?

Yes, Mom.
"Z"receiver.

It's Mojo Radio, Slammin'Sammy,
and I've got Jerry on the line with us
from the Sonic down there.

Jerry, there's a lot of talk
that Coach Gaines,

with that $60,000 a year salary...

 I know where we're goin' with this.
 He makes a little bit more
than the principal of the school.

I read the book... Just last week,
I was readin'this book about Babe Ruth,

and they asked him
if he deserved his salary...

way back in 1910... 04, whatever it was,
and he said, "Hey, you know..."

They said, " You make more than
the president. "He says," Well, you know,
can the president hit a baseball?"

I'm tellin'you right now, you know,
Coach Gary Gaines, they could give him
$ 100,000 a year,

and if these boys go undefeated,
it's worth every single dollar.

I tell you what, the principal,
uh, of Permian
don't get 28,000 people...

 I got two
to three seconds of rotation and
my linemen are an 80 pass block.

Wide receiver?
He runs the... burst route.

If he sees cover two, he...
he bends outside, eight to 12 yards.

20 yards, and runs
straight to the sideline.

Are you ready for this, Mike?

"
Yo. Ivory!

Ready to work?

'Sup, Boobie? State.

State? State?

State. State.
State.

Where your girlfriend at, Water Bug?

Well...
We ain't got a girlfriend yet?

Come on. Let's go. Snap it up.
You wanna know why
you ain't got a girl yet, Water Bug?

Why?
You got the wrong shoes on, man.

You got on white Adidas.
Everybody know the shoe is Nikes.

Nothin' holds a nickel next to Nike.
Ask Ivory. Ask Preacher Man.

What kind of shoes
on your feet don't matter.
Come on, Preacher. Bullshit!

Don't matter at all.
You know God made black beautiful.

God made Boobie beautiful,
black and strong.

His mouth keeps gettin'
bigger and bigger and bigger.

And when Boobie knocks some fools out,
Boobie gonna knock 'em out with
black Nikes on his feet. Ain't that right?

I could knock you out
in a pair of flip-flops.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna knock 'em out
with Nikes on my feet,

and I'm gonna smile when I do.

Let's go. Five minutes. Let's go.

Get up. Let's go.

How y'all doin' up there?
Y'all doin' all right?

45, Boobie...
That's my nephew out there.

The boy can play some football.
I'm telling you.

 I think he'll win
the Heisman Trophy someday.
 The Heisman, really?

Oh, yes sir. You can bet on it.
I got it.! I got it.!

Who's you guys'favorite player?
Boobie Miles.

He can spin left. He can spin right.
Don't make no difference.

He can block, tackle,
score the touchdown, snap the ball,

hold the snap
and kick the extra point.

Hell, the boy will fill up
the Gatorade cooler, walk the dog,
and paint your back porch.

I'm telling you, that boy
can flat out play football.

Ow! And he can pass!

Should we believe the hype?
What hype?

The hype about Boobie Miles.
No, hype is something
that's not for real.

I'm all real.

I'm Chris Comer. I'm a running back.
So that means you're Boobie's backup?

I'm actually Boobie's backup backup.
I'm third string right now.

You know which way
you're supposed to run?
Yeah, with strong right...

I ain't talkin' about the play.
I know what the play was, okay?

I know what the play was, okay?

Odessa's a small town, and, uh,

if you screw up,
everybody knows about it.

Your dad played at Permian.
What's it like to be the son
of a local legend?

Hold on to the damn ball, Donnie!

Next question.

There it goes.! There it is.!
How are your grades, Boobie?

I get straight A's.
I'm an athlete.

In what subject?
There's only one subject.
It's football.

Ain't no other subject,
you know?
Hut!

Hang on to the ball.! The ball.!

You sure he's part of
your gene pool, Charlie?

Shit.

Red alert.
Red alert, everybody.

What about the expectations
of coaching a team like this
in a community like this?

Well, I guess there's always
a surprise or two in every community.

Ball. J ust concentrate on
hangin' on the ball. Both hands.

Hey, Donnie. Hey.

Come here. Come here.
What's the problem?
Get off the field, Dad.

Why can't you hold on to the football?
What's so goddamn hard
about holdin' on to it?

I'm sorry.
All you gotta do is hold on to the
goddamn football, and you can't do it.

Tell me why you can't do it.
J ust tell me. That's all I wanna know.

I'll try better next time.
Come on.
Hey!

 Charlie.!
Don't you walk away from me.

Leave him alone.
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talkin'to you, you hear me?

Tell me why you can't
hold on to the ball.!
 Enough.!

Tell me. Answer a question.
Mr. Billingsley.

It's the first day of practice.
This is practice. Seriously.

Enough. Charlie!

Embarrassin' me out here.
Jesus Christ.

It's all right, Don.

 It's all right.
Don't worry about it. Here we go.

Slot right. 38...
Billingsley, you ain't gotta worry
about holdin' on to the ball, man.

Why's that?
'Cause you ain't gonna get the ball.

Your job is to be blockin' for Boobie.
I don't care if your daddy
is over there cryin'.

You can...
You never shut up, do you?

Our team's been playin' with each other
for a long time and, uh,

we got the brotherhood
part of it down pretty much.

People here at Permian are already
predicting a state championship.

Is there any pressure to that
for you guys?

Well, any time they start predictin'
the state championships,
there's always pressure, believe me.

You guys don't have a lot of size.
How can you make up for that?

We're gonna rely on our speed,
discipline.

Come on, Ivory.
You're in the game now.
You're in the game.

Do football players
get special treatment here?

What do you have to do
to be a better football player this year?

Do you enjoy playing football?

You quit reading
your press clippings, all right?

Because you're smaller,
and you're gonna be smaller every week.

Yo, Boobie Miles!
It is hard to be humble.

Ain't gonna be no growth spurt
between now and the first game.

Where does all that anger
come from?

They're gonna underestimate you
every single week.

We teach you this technique
for a reason.

We do not do this
to make our heads rattle.

You're gonna use your mind.

You're gonna play with your heart.
Come on.!

That's what you're gonna use
to win the state championship.

Get up, Ivory. Get up.
Get up! Get up.

It's a good day, gentlemen.
It's a good day to think
about responsibility.

It's a good day to ask yourself
if on a personal level you're willing
to accept that...

if you're willing to accept
the responsibility that you have...

to protect this team
and this school and this town.

And make no mistake
about it, gentlemen,

we are in the business
of protecting this town.

We're in the business
of winning.

The expectations
couldn't be any higher.

We will win state.

We will win state.

Can you be perfect?

Mojo.!

No, I'm all right.
Come on, Mike. Live a little.

He's not going out, either.
Yeah, he is.

Mike, you're going out tonight.
If I have anything to say about it,
you're gonna get laid too.

Billingsley.! Billingsley.!
Party at Taylor's house now, Billingsley.!

You better be there. Gonna get wasted.!
Party at Taylor's house.!

Billingsley!

Isn't that guy, like, 35?

Mike. Here's your mom's food.

How much?
No, no. Don't worry about it.
It's on us. It's on us.

How's she doin', by the way?
You never give me free food, David.

I just gave you free food.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

Say hi to your mom, huh?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

Stay out of jail, Billingsley.

We're not goin' home, Mike.
I ain't goin' out drunk foolin'.

How 'bout I bring
your mom some dinner
so you can come out with us?

Because we're gonna get laid,
and we're gonna get drunk, and
we're gonna win state, but not tonight.

All right?

You been blessed, Mike,
'cause we got a runner.

He's gonna make us all look good.
So I'm telling you to lighten up.

All you gotta do is exist in those
two seconds between snap
and you givin' Boobie the ball.

So lighten up, Mike.
Mike.

How you doin'?
Hey, Brian.

How's old Gaines treatin' you?
Got you all perfect?
We gettin' there.

All right.
How's your mama?
Fine, sir.

All right. You mind if we get a shot
real quick with the kid, little picture?
Shot?

Yeah, little picture.
Yeah, sure.

Here. All right, sweetie.
J ust take a picture.

My baby girl and the next Texas
state championship quarterback, huh?

Where's the damn camera?

Winchell, boy, you remember
every minute of this.
I'm tellin'you right now.

You're 17, but it goes fast.
Don't sleep. Don't waste a second of it.

'Cause before you know it,
it's done.

Nothin' but babies and memories.
You hear me?

Babies and memories.
Smile, sweetheart. Give us a smile.
Say "Mojo." Say "Mojo."

I tell you what, why don't
you hold on to her for a little while?
Babysit her for us for a couple hours.

We're gonna go get a drink.
We'll be back in a little bit.

All right. I'm kiddin' with ya.
Come here. Come here, sweet...

Come here, sweetie.
Let's go back over to Mama.
All right.

Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, hey. Bring it home, huh?

Bring one of these home.
Get you one of these.

Christian, get you one of these.
Boys? Right here.

Come up here a second.
Got some change for you.

Wanna go to that party?
J ust for a little bit?

"Tricky, tricky"

"It's tricky to rock a rhyme

"It's tricky"
"T-t-t-tricky, tricky"

"I met this little girlie
Her hair was..."

What I saw was speed out there,
but uh, where's the beef, Coach?

I saw me some small boys.
They're small.

I think we're gonna be okay.
On defense?

Yes, ma'am. I firmly believe that.
We got some backs.
We're about, what, 180?

"Tricky, tricky, tricky"

"It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky"

Hi, Mike.

I'm Melissa.
I know who you are.

You do?
Everybody knows
who you are, Melissa.

Everybody knows
who you are, Mike.

Is that right?

Whole lot of... Arab oil embargo.
Oh, God.

Don't talk about that.
Midland Lee likes to bust it
up the middle, too.

You're right about that.
You know what you should do?

You should play Boobie Miles defense.
Work him both ways.

The problem with that is
I don't want to get him hurt.
We need him to score touchdowns.

Bullshit. That big nigger
ain't gonna break.

You wanna beat Midland Lee,
you play him middle linebacker.

Break some heads out there.
Are you ready for Midland Lee, coach?

"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it"

This is not about Boobie. This is
about the fact that we're sittin'here
in the stairwell while they're up there.

I wanna be with a ball carrier.
Baby, Boobie is...

Don't you "Baby, Boobie" me.
I wanna see somethin'.

Can I get a touchdown?
How 'bout that?
Can I get a touchdown?

Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I don't know.

Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?

Is that a rule or somethin'?

No, not really.
Well, then,
why don't you have a girlfriend?

J ust don't.
Are you gay?

What?
Is he gay?

I'm not gay.
Can you prove it?

Coach, here's to the start of
your second season as our head coach.

We're here,
we believe in you and Sharon.
Thank you.

To sittin' here in December
as the state champions of Texas.

Let's bring 'em hell. Go Mojo!
Go Mojo!

Go Mojo!
Bring us some glory, Coach.

" That's what I say
Don't need nothin'but a good time"
Go! Go! Go!

Why isn't anyone allowed
at your house?

People come over.

When?

Is your mother really crazy?

No.

Are you crazy?

Do I look crazy?

Look like someone who's gonna get
the hell out of Odessa, Texas one day
and never look back.

Seriously works for me.

See ya.

Get in here, boy.

Come on. Get this off.
Ow.

That's good.

Ow!

Take my shoes...

Don't get so prude.
Stop. We're on your couch.

Something for everybody. Oh.

Let's go to your room.

Let's go to your bedroom.
Dad, can you just go
back to bed, please?

Who's this? This Melissa?

Yes.
Maria.

How you doin', Maria?
Damn, girl. You have grown up.

Dad, please.
Can you just go back to bed?

What happened to my lamp?

Hey, y'all. What's goin'on?
Hey, Flippy.

Hi, Maria.
What happened to my lamp?

I dropped it.
Yeah, you dropped it.

That makes perfect sense, huh?
He dropped it. Can't hold on to
the lamp, can't hold on to the football.

I can hold on to the football, Dad,
now get the hell out of here!

Little fumble,
can't hold on to the football.

Since when can you hold
on to the football?

I haven't seen it.
Y'all don't do it today?

How about yesterday? You hold on
to the football yesterday? Have you
seen him hold on to the football?

How 'bout tomorrow?
You gonna hold on to it tomorrow?
How 'bout now?

Can you hold on...
Hold on to the football.
Goddamn it, Dad.

Dad.
Maybe this'll help.

 What are you doing?
Hold... on... to... the football!

Dad! Goddamn it, Dad!
Knock it off!

That's enough.!

I don't think we've felt this kind of
expectation in years.

If Winchell shows up
like we know he can,

even a short passing game
to give Boobie Miles
a couple of feet of cushion...

You boys all right?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Gonna win state?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.
Undefeated?

Yes, sir.
Get it done.

Take this opportunity
to support the Permian Panthers...

"The Southern California lifestyle
is but one of the bonus features...

of playing for..."

What's that word?
Uh, "distinguished."

Who's that one from, UCLA?
No, this is USC.
That's UCLA right there.

Hey, Mike. You gonna come visit
my distinguished ass in California?

See if I can put the damn smile
on your face.

You know I'm fittin'
to be rich, right?

I'm thinkin'about hiring,
uh, Eddie Murphy
to lay some of his shit on you...

till you crack a damn smile.

No? Well, what about
Richard Pryor?

Bill Cosby?
I know you like Bill Cosby.

Mike Winchell, you got
a natural ability...

for throwing Boobie Miles the ball.

Any every once in a while
you throw a pretty good pass,

so you're going to eat
yourJell-O Pudding Pops.

Wah!

Yo, Mike Winchell. You gonna move
out of Odessa, Texas one day, baby,

and you gonna come visit
Boobie Miles in California,

and you gonna smile,

or I'm gonna stick
about four pudding pops
up your white ass.

Now, now... Oh, my God.!
I got Mike Winchell to smile.!

Look at this! Wah!

Did y'all see it? Wah.!

That's probably the only smile
y'all gonna see from Mike
all season.

Yeah. Yeah.

I'm distinguished now.
Hey, Boobie.

What?
You didn't lift.

Come on, man.
This is God-given.

Only thing I gotta do
is just show up.

Now, people call this monument out here,
the Ratliff Stadium,

the monument to football of Odessa.

They say some of that money
should have gone to the school.

What's your feelings on that, D.U.?
You played ball.

 Ain't that stadium
part of the school?

So I say that money did go to the school.
What's everybody whinin'about?

This is football country, folks.
Come on. Get your heads out.

Hi, Don.
Hey, Karen.

It's you. Do you like it?
Do you like it?
Think so. What is it?

Rice Krispy.
You like it, right?
Yeah, I love it.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Hey, Gary?
Hey, John. How you doin'?

Good. Um, you real busy?

I got a minute or two.
What you got up?

Well, I got some characters out here.
Well, who you got with you?

Wilkins.
Well, hey.
Hey, J im. How you doin'?

How's that pretty wife of yours?
She's good.

Ready for Friday night?
Sure hope so.
Seems pretty good.

I feel pretty good about it.
I really do.
 We're just, uh...

Wanted to come by and visit,

maybe talk about defense
a little bit, if you got a second.

You got a second?

We got a dog named Mojo.
We got a cat named Panther.

 You got season tickets?
 You kiddin'?
We don't miss anything.

I nstead of the cover 2 zone.
Get the D-line in as many gaps
and stack gaps as possible.

Double dent, type of technique.

Hey, Boobie.
Hey.

How you doin'?
All right.

Strong "B"slide force.
Hell, we can look at...

He'll still be a robber...
Get Ivory out of the board...

And go!
Go, go, go, go.

Go by the speed and make up
for the size differential...
What do you think, Coach?

Now, obviously we're not Division I,
but we got a good program.

You play well enough,
we'll find you a spot at Kansas Wesleyan.

How far is the drive?
What drive?

To your school. How far is it
from Odessa to your school?

I don't know. 10 or 12 hours.
Are you offering?

Ma'am?
Right now. Are you offering?

If you are, we're in.
Mom.

He'll sign his intent right now.

Well, obviously we're interested,
Miss Winchell, otherwise
we wouldn't be here, Mike.

But right now, that's all we are, is...
I nterested.

Now, you go get at 'em,
you throw some touchdowns,

you win some football games,
maybe a state championship, huh?

We'll see if we can't find you a home
at Kansas Wesleyan.

Yes, sir.

Do you like playin' football, Mike?
Yes, sir.

Is it fun for you?

Lots of fun, sir.
He loves the game.

That's good. It's important.
It's... legitimate love of the game.

Supposed to be fun,
you know?

Greatest game in the world.

I'm not that good at toastin',
but, uh, I'll give it a try.

Um, fact is I don't know if I've ever
done a toast myself before.
Been involved in a few, but uh...

Uh, well, here's to Boobie Miles, who...

Well, everything... everything you get
this year, you deserve it,

because you... you work hard,
and you... I'm real proud of you.

And, um, L. V., to you l... I can't
even tell you how proud of you I am,

the way you've raised this kid
and what you do for him, and uh...

Here's to a great season,
and uh, God bless us.

God bless us.
God bless.

We been thinkin'about this
for four months now.

You seniors have been
thinkin'about it for 17 years.

Well, it's here now.
It's time.

If any of you have any doubt
in your mind,

I don't want you to walk
through that door over there.

You shouldn't have any doubt
in your mind about what
you're supposed to do tonight,

and about how
you're supposed to do it.

So let's take care of it!

"

"Don't know we can do this
'Cause we always knew this"

"Ha, ha
Yeah, boy"

"Bass
How low can you go"

" Death row
What a brother know"
Way to go.

Do you understand?
Hut!

Boobie Miles.

You can't turn it back
to Boobie Miles!

All Boobie, all the time here.

A Mojo first down.

Boobie around one more.!

Yeah! That's my boy!
Boobie Miles for 45 yards...

Score for Mojo. Touchdown.

Billingsley takes it right.
Boobie. Here we go again.

Into the end zone.
Touchdown, Mojo.

Boobie Miles has it all,
all in one great package...

the speed, the size, the athleticism.

Let me tell you, folks, Boobie Miles
is worth the price of admission.

Yeah!
Yeah, all right!

Boobie Miles breakin'loose
one more time.
Yes, sir!

Broke the line.
Chavez.!

Chavez is playin'like a man possessed.

Whoo!

God damn, I'm so proud of ya!
Calm down, son.

Chavez will eat you...
Billingsley. Hey, Billingsley.

Whoo!
Go sit...
Go get on the bench.

Get on the bench.
Boy, crazy.

I like enthusiasm, but my goodness.

He's gonna throw it.
What an arm.! Did you see...

Boobie Miles, from 35 yards out,

scores a Mojo touchdown.

You're doin' a great job.
Give me a smile. Give me a smile.
Thank you, Coach.

Boobie Miles is about as solid
as you can ask for.

He ain't gonna smile.
He's more internal.
Why not? Why didn't he ever smile?

 Mojo.! Mojo.!
Keep watchin'out.

Let me kick that extra point.
Not this time. You did enough.

Come on.
Chris Comer! Come in.

Comer! You're in the game.
Come on.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, son. Come here!
Come here! Where you goin'?

You don't want me to go in, Coach?
You don't want a helmet?

Where's your helmet?
Go get it!
Yes, sir!

You see my helmet, man?
Find your helmet, son.

What you lookin' for, Water Bug?
Let me get this real quick.
Let me get your helmet, man.

Come on, come on.
My goodness gracious.

Boobie.
Water Bug, you can't come out here
with no helmet, man.

You seen my helmet right here?
I can't believe it.

28 sweep. 28 sweep.

You don't know where your helmet is?
What are you thinkin'?
Where did you put your helmet?

Right there a second ago.
Well, it ain't there!

Do you not know that you
play the game with a helmet on?

Put your tail end right there.!
Hut!

He throws back to Miles.

Miles cuts to his right.

Bailey takes him down.

Was that a knee?
Could have been.

Hold on. Hold on.

 Winchell
was still in there. Billingsley was
still in there. Unfortunately...

the running back's been taken down hard
and it looks like a knee could possibly...

J ust gonna touch the kneecap here.

Does it hurt over here, son?

Get up, Boobie.

Let me take a look at this.
Let me look at it.

It's definitely his A.C.L.
I mean, it's a legitimate tear.

Do you think he tore any cartilage?
Maybe. I could feel the knee catching.

What do you think?

This kid, it's all about
how he responds mentally.

I don't know.

All right, everybody.
Listen up.

He's gonna be fine.
It's not serious. There's no tear.
He'll be back in a week.

That's the good news.

Even better news, y'all played
a great football game tonight.

A real good football game.

I'm real proud of ya.

And Mike...
Where's Mike Winchell?

Mike, I'm proud of you, son.

You showed discipline.
You showed leadership.

You played your butt off, son.
I'm proud of you.

All of you. Proud of all of you.
And, uh, Wilson...

Now that's body tackle.
That's what I been tellin'you about.

Did y'all see him tonight?

Anyway, I'm proud of every one of you.
I'm proud of the coaches, all of y'all,
each and every player.

I want you to go celebrate.
Feel good about yourselves
tonight, okay? Come on!

 We only got
a minute and a half left in the game,
we're leadin'by a good lead.

He leaves the boy in there like that.
That makes no sense.!

You gotta protect your best asset.!
What's the matter with this man?

He could have ruined
the whole season for us right there.

We were up. We were winnin'big,
and the boy stays in the game.

Yeah.! What's... You don't need any more.
You don't need to accomplish any more.

I think Coach Gaines
is a stupid f... in'idiot.

 Hey.
 Well, he sh... You know,
he shouldn't have put him in.

I mean, we had a big lead
and everything.

I don't understand
what that was all about.

We can't do anything without Boobie.
We had the game won...

I'm feelin'some damage
on the right side here.

Well, can I play on Friday?
I think you got a slight tear.

Can he play?
Yeah, can I play?

Can he play football?

Can I?

You need to get up to Midland,
get an M.R.I.

Can a M.R.I. fix your knee?

Is he the one player
you can't do without?

Well, l... I never looked at it
that way. A football team is not
about one player or two players.

A football team is about the team.

This is a unit, and that's
the way we have to play.

Uh, it's gonna be a...
It's gonna be a challenge.

You are makin'
some bad decisions!

You're playin'like the village idiot.
You want people to think you're
the village idiot? Is that what you want?

The Eagles take down
the Panthers, 49-6,

and for Coach Gary Gaines,
it's gotta be back to the drawing board.

That's gonna be the word
around town all week.

Coach Gaines, what are you gonna do?
The loss of Boobie Miles can not
result in the loss of this season.

Hell of a game.
Gimme the keys.

Way to take care of business.
Gimme the keys, Dad.

We, uh... We just need
a few more days, Coach,
and we be back.

You go into Midland,
get that M.R.I.?

I don't need nothin'in Midland.
Those rich hillbillies ain't never seen
nothin'as pretty as Boobie Miles.

Them M.R.I. machines
wouldn't know what to do with it.

He gonna be just fine, Coach Gaines.

Uh, we gonna go back to the clinic
but they already said ain't no tears.

No tears?
Ain't no tear.

Is that what they said?

Yes, sir. Uh, we gonna go back
for some double confirmation,

but when it come time
to play Midland Lee,
we be good to go, Coach.

That's good, then.

He designed his offense
around one player.

We're dead.
 We're not dead.

We just need to start
throwin' the football.
We're dead.

Dead. Pull it.

We gotta lighten up. We're 17.

Do you feel 17?

I don't feel 17. Pull it.

We will win state.

Chavo, you're like a human pinata.

You get your ass all beat on
more than anybody I know,
and you just sit there and spit out candy.

That's 'cause he's out of here.
He's got the grades.

No matter what, if we win or lose,
he knows he's gettin' out.

He's like the one foot
out the door man.
It's true, Chavo.

 You're gonna be
drinkin'martinis,
Gimme the gun.

eatin'lamb chops,
gettin'manicures.

 You're just jealous.
Removin' your freakin' shoes.

What's it like being the quarterback?

I mean, this is a big responsibility
for a 17-year-old kid.

No.! That is not acceptable.!

Uh... It's sort of... I mean, uh...

It's not too bad. I know, uh...

You are playin'like a fool.!
Do you think
you can handle it?

If you got a receiver
gettin' jammed inside,
what will you do with your brain?

Yeah, I hope so.
What will your brain do?

You'll throw outside!
Throw it outside.

You'll throw outside!
Now you think you can do that?

Yes, sir.
Well, show me.
Show me!

Hey.

Yeah, well, I thought
maybe if you came home
it would help out a little bit.

She's sick.
She's not doin' so good.

It's just kinda hard.
Football's startin' and this is a lot.

Well, I thought if maybe you could
come home, it'd help out a little bit,

'cause she's your mother, too.

Okay. Okay.

 Okay.

Can you get the job done, Mike?

We're pretty small.
I didn't ask you
if you think we're small.

I asked you if you think
we can get the job done.

Think so.
Well, you're gonna have to do better
than "I think so."Is that clear?

It's clear.

Now I'm gonna assume
that by now you've learned
that the world's not fair...

and sometimes
you get the short end.
That's all you get.

And if you don't do
something personally to fix it,

that's all you're ever gonna get.

Yes, sir.

Mike.

Do you wanna play college ball?
Do you wanna get out of this town?

Think so.

Well, why aren't you
doin' something about it?

My mind's not right.

One of these days you're gonna
have to get out of this house.

You're gonna have to leave her.

Yes, sir.

You gotta accept the fact that
people have to take care of themselves,
and that includes you.

You understand that?
Yes, sir.

Okay. The truth is,

against some
pretty overwhelming odds,

if... if you do decide to accept that...

Look at me, Mike.

If you decide to accept that,

you're gonna seriously fly, son.

 Same song, different
verse. Middle of the second quarter,
Cooper has a 14-nothing lead.

Things are really going south
in a hurry.

But when you got an offense play
built around one player, that's great,
as long as the player's there.

When he gets hurt,
in this case like Boobie Miles did,
what do you do?

I don't know, but Gaines
better come up with a plan quick...

'cause the unthinkable's
gonna happen.

The Panthers are gonna lose
two consecutive district games.

Wilson gets the hand-off and he's
got room to run on the left-hand side.

Across the line. Clotheslined.!

And he's down.!
Gimme a running back!
We got a running back?

Permian has lost Boobie Miles,
now Wilson,

Comer! Comer!
Yeah, come on!

leaving him with third-string
running back Chris Comer.

Hut!
Comer around the right side,

has some room to run and...
runs out of bounds.

What is that?

I didn't have a block.
You are so dumb! Are you scared?

I didn't have no block.
Football is a contact sport!

I think he's a sophomore.
May be lookin'for
a badminton scholarship or something.

That's not gonna cut it.

Blue 40.! Hut.!

The snap. Lookin'to throw.
Here comes the rush.

Winchell avoids the rush,
throws the ball,
Comer turns from blocker to receiver.

Has the ball, crosses the 20-yard line,
crosses the 30.

Comer to the 40.! Comer to the 50.!

Where did this speed come from?
Go, go, go!

Who was that?
It was Comer.

Our Comer?
It was Comer. It was Comer!

Comer has a Mojo touchdown.!

Chris Comer with his first varsity T.D.

Not letting go of that ball.
Gimme the ball.

85 yards, the second-longest
power play in Permian history.
Gimme the ball. Gimme the ball!

Interception, Brian Chavez.!

Abilene Cooper back to punt.
It's blocked.!

Touchdown, Permian.!

That's a Mojo touchdown.
Jesus!

Billingsley up the middle,
picks up a great block from Comer.
Run, Donnie!

Forearm shove behind him,
in for the Mojo touchdown.

There's your old school football.

"Oh yeah"

"Got my Mojo working, baby"

Where did this guy come from?

Chris Comer afforded
a couple of fantastic runs
and one fantastic pass reception,

leading Mojo from a 14-nothing deficit.

Hello?

I'm feelin'great. How are you?
I feel much better than I did
before the hit.

This team has a swagger. They're
walkin'tall. They're playin'tough.

 I love these kids.
I love the way Winchell's playin'.

 Real good. They came
together after Boobie went out...

He's got him.
Touchdown in the corner.!

You know,
we just have to dig deep...

Comer's amazing. You know,
he's stepping in just nicely.

My concern is that he doesn't
have the experience in the long run.

If they can just stay strong,
not get overconfident,

and take out Midland Lee
I think we're goin', man.

I think we're gonna go all the way,
but I'm a little worried.

Oh no, sir.
It's just a small sprain.

It was just, uh, a precaution.
We're on a roll.

 Don't get started
on the celebration dance.
We got Midland comin'up.

Midland Lee is the real deal.

You don't need to be slackin'right now.
You gotta be playin'and practicin'.

Permian zips past
North Shore Galena 17-3.

Come on. We're five and one.
The team is winning now.

They all win, but who we playin'?
Come on. Mediocre teams.

Two losses could shut the door
on the Permian Panthers.

Let's not start tootin'the horns
just yet, you know what I mean?

You lose two division games
in this football climate,
and you're done, Sammy. You're done.

Midland.
Boobie.

This the best damn hospital
in Texas.

The very best.

My son, Andrew, played for Midland,
and ended up back East at Penn.

Oh, he playin' with,
uh, Joe Paterno.

University of Pennsylvania.
Uh, premed.

Oh.
Just let it relax.
You have any pain?

Not at all.
Does this hurt?

Nope.
None of that hurts?

Nope.
Okay. Go ahead and sit up and
just let your legs hang over the side.

I n fact, why don't you
go ahead and get dressed
and let me look at the scan.

l-I'm sorry.
You're James' dad?

No, I'm his uncle.
Come over and let me...
let me look at the scan with you.

Uh, this is the scan
we just did today of his knee...

and this is looking right
through the middle of the knee.

What we're looking at
right through here is... is the A.C.L.,

and what this shows is that
he's had a fairly significant,
fairly serious injury.

James, let me show you.
Right through here
is where the injury is,

and it looks like you've had
a pretty serious injury
to that part of your knee.

Significant enough that...
that I have concerns about
what you can do from here on.

So when can I suit up?

Well, let me just say with how
your knee felt when I examined it
and what I see on the scan...

With... with the...
the things that you do well...

The reason that you're great
is that you can run and cut
and hammer people...

and you don't hesitate
because you've got a solid knee.

When you don't have this ligament,
you can't do that,
so it's really out of the question.

What? No, no, no. That's...
That's not what Dr. Spencer said.

He said three weeks.
Three weeks is up,
and I'm ready to play.

I understand. I understand,
but again, when l...

Based on what I see
when I feel your knee, examine
your knee... What I see here...

You... You really can't play
with this kind of knee.

What are you talkin'
about, I can't play?
I'm gonna play.

I'm ready to play.
My team needs me.
I'm ready to play.

Listen to me.
I am listenin' to you.

l-I want...
I want what's best for you.

You and I
are on the same page...
We ain't on the same page.!

How you gonna want
what's best for me?
Hold on. Hold on.

How you gonna want
what's best for me?
You from Midland, right?

You from Midland? Huh?
This is bull, man.

You just jealous
'cause you from Midland.

What I recommend...
You jealous 'cause you from Midland.
Who paying you?

Who paying you?
Come on, Boobie. That's okay.

You tryin' to take
my football career!

You tryin'to take
my football career.!
Boobie, let's get out of here.

Tryin'to take my football career.!
Whatever you're sayin' to me,
listen to me.

Come on!
Pig!

Here back on Mojo Radio,
it's Slammin'Sammy Stands.

I knew tonight's game was gonna
be a big game, but it just got bigger.

Earlier today, Cooper beat Woodland,
which means that if Permian wins tonight,
they're in the play-offs.

If they lose, though, they fall back
into a three-way tie for first place,

and that means the tie-breaker
is a coin toss.

So what'd the doctor say?

'Cause, see, if you go out there
before your knee's ready...
Coach, my knee's fine.

You okay with this, L.V.?

Yeah, I'm good with it.
Hundred percent.

Go get dressed.

The most storied rivalry
in the state of Texas...

is Permian hosting
the Midland Lee Rebels
at Ratliff Stadium.

Tonight one of these teams
could take a step toward the play-offs.

Permian has one district loss,
both Cooper and Midland Lee have two.

There's no doubt about that.

A win tonight puts
Permian in the play-offs,
no coin flip needed,

plus it'll send the Lee Rebels
home for the season.

 Well, what
do you know, folks. Look at this
coming out of the locker room.

Number 45 has emerged
from the locker room.

Boobie doesn't look like
he's limping at all.

He looks good to me.
He looks like he's ready to go.

Now the question is, decoy or player?

He ain't gonna play.
I don't think so either.

 From what I know
about Coach Gary Gaines, nobody
holds his cards closer than Gary does.

Come on, guys. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Hut.!

Winchell pitches to Comer.
Flipped on his head.!

Winchell, pressured by Olivera,
swings a pass out to Billingsley...
Picked off!

It's Dominguez.
Dominguez will take it in
from 25 yards away.

And Lee brings home points.

Hang on to the ball, son!

Don't worry about it.
Shake it off. Shake it off.

Don't worry about it, Coach.
Let me spin. Let me spin, Coach.

Y'all wanna win, put Boobie in.

Set. Hut.! Hut.!

Winchell
will swing it out to Billingsley.
Come on, Donnie.

And the ball is tripped
by Dominguez.

Kevin Lane, and a blatant
body slam by Billingsley.
Donnie! Donnie!

What's up?

My goodness. Son, is there
something wrong with you?
Are you mentally okay?

What are you
puttin' your helmet on for?
Take your helmet off, son.

You're gonna sit on the bench
for a little while.
You don't need that helmet.

Third down, with less than
two minutes to play in the half.

Strandler over the left side,
uncontested. 32 yards down to T.D.

 Permian came in
with a four-game win streak
but they haven't been tested all year.

Coach Gaines is gonna have to find
a way to get his offense on track...

or start feeling his season
slipping through his fingers.

Do you think you're playin'football?
Do you think you're playin'football?

Do you think you're playin'football?
You are showing me nothing.!

Do you understand me?
Do you think you got it made?

Do you think you got it made?

Because if that's what you think,

you're gonna find out what
it feels like to sit on your asses...

and watch Midland Lee
take your season!

No offense tonight for Mojo, and still
no sign ofJames "Boobie"Miles.

Y'all wanna win? Put Boobie in.
I'm about to spin.

Come on, Coach. Come on, Coach.
Let me get this for you.

Under five minutes to play
and Lee still leads 14-7.

Weak defense, weak offense
and no Boobie. If you're
Coach Gaines, what do you do?

Right now Mike Winchell
can't get this offense going,

and the Midland coach
has seen Boobie on the sidelines.

If you don't put him in,
he knows you're bluffing.
I'd put him in.

All right. Move out!

Come on!

Boobie! You're in.
Let's go! Let's go!
What you want, yo?

Well, we apparently are all
gonna get what we wished for,

because here comes Boobie Miles,
and this is certainly
what the fans came to see.

That's number 45
back in the Permian backfield.

Back slam, 37 stretch...
 Break!

Now Boobie the senior,
Number 45, lining up behind
quarterback Mike Winchell,

and offensive line is rarin'to go
with room to run.

Three, 12, hut.!

Miles going left.
Hesitates just a bit.

Get off! Get off!

Let's go with 60-Cheetah.
60-Cheetah!

Let's go! Let's go!

They're gonna cheat up close
to the line again and see if they're
gonna run Boobie one more time.

He will go to the right.
There is a hole.

He gets a block.
The Dominguez brothers take him down.
He spins and he's down.

Take it easy. Stay down.

Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
Try to relax.

Let me take a look at it.

I'm gonna get up on my own.
I can get up on my own.

Folks, the utterjoy of watching
Boobie Miles trot back on to the field...

has been replaced by the sheer misery
of watching him being carried off of it.

We unfortunately may have seen
the last of Boobie Miles
in the black and white of Permian.

Let me see.
He's done.

We're gonna go jet fire, Coach.
Well, you better go somethin'!

One minute 35 seconds
left to play in this one.

Panthers move immediately
to the hurry-up offense.

 Boobie
no longer a factor. Comer, following
the tackle, will dig up near midfield.

The clock now inside of 1:20.
It'll be second down, Permian.

Lee clinging to that seven-point lead
and time becomes a factor.

60 Cheetah.
60 Cheetah! 60 Cheetah! Hut!

Again, Winchell to Payne,
beating Preston.

Only 40 seconds left.
Mike Winchell trying to keep
Permian's play-off hopes alive.

Completes the pass.
He's got it. He's got it.

Winchell was drilled,
but he seems to be okay.

Back it off!
Winchell, past time, he's lookin'.

Again, Winchell to Payne.
The clock continues to run.

25 seconds left.
Go, go!

Let's go! We got four up!

Hold it.! Hut.!

Mike Winchell trying to keep
the play-off hopes alive. Complete.!

We gotta go with...

This is for the ball game.
The clock is still moving.

Come on, front line!

Mike Winchell will go for the shotgun,
steps back and he drops the ball.!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

Picks it up, steps into the pocket,
looking for Allen Wyles, he's open.

Here's the pass, and it's... too tall.!

Midland Lee wins the ball game.

It's all right.
No, man.

I'm sorry.
It's all right.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
