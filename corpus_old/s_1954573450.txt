Hi, Mr. McCall.

What you got there?
Tuna.

Bread?
Whole-grain, gluten-free.

Okay. Condiments?
Sprouts, avocado and Vegenaise mayo.

Okay.

A bone in the tuna.

Oh...

What? Potatoes are a vegetable.
I like crunchy things.

Carrots are crunchy.
Dried seaweed.

I'm a human, not a rabbit.

Hm?

The fish.
Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, he did.

It's a happy ending.

Well, not exactly.

Old man tied the fish to the side
of the boat, had to row back to shore,

fish bled in the water,

sharks came

and ate the whole fish
till there was nothing left.

That's just kind of a waste, isn't it?
Depends upon how you look at it.

The old man met his adversary when
he thought that part of his life was over.

He saw himself in the fish.

Came to...

Came to respect it the more it fought.

Why didn't he just let the fish go?

The old man's gotta be the old man.

Hm?

No.

No Mrs. Robert at home?

No.

Once.

Did you break her heart?

She broke mine.

You know,
I see a lot of widowed guys.

Something in your eyes.

You know, it's not sad.

It's just kind of...

lost, you know?

You always read books?

My wife did. She, uh...

She was working through the 100
Books Everybody Should Read.

She made it to 97, so I figured...

I'd give it a shot.

And one day we'd have something
to talk about when we get together.

Wow, a hundred books.
Yeah.

Holy moly.
Heh, heh.

How many have you read, Robert?
Ninety-one.

(RING-TONE PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)

Sorry, this damn thing.

Ninety-one books, though.

You're almost done.
Almost.

What are you gonna do after that?
Singing lessons.

Then I'm gonna open

I can't sleep at night.

ALINA: Yeah, well, I get
to hear your stories.

What's your new one about?

Oh, it's about a guy who thinks
he's a knight in shining armor.

The only thing is, he lives in a world
where knights don't exist anymore.

Who are you?
Just a friend.

A guy hit her.

And she hit him back.

A guy called Slavi.

So Slavi made example of her.

They do that.

They burned one girl's face
with battery acid.

Keep her around as a reminder
for the rest of us.

They brought Teri over
very young.

Think she got to the point where

she thought her life
could be hers one day.

Slavi reminded her it never would be.

He said he'd cut her throat
next time.

He said a whore who fucks and can't
talk might be worth twice as much.

(WATCH BEEPS)

Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you.
Yeah.

We're looking into a homicide
that occurred two weeks ago.

Five dead. Russian restaurant.

I heard about it on TV.
I happened to be there that night.

Oh, you were?
Yeah.

You wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
Right.

We're just checking to see if anyone
remembered anything suspicious.

Not that I recall.

May I ask why you dined
at that particular restaurant?

I like pirozhki.

There's five Russian restaurants
in walking distance of your apartment.

I assume they all serve pirozhki.

Wow. I was meeting a friend.
It was her idea.

Then I guess I should talk...
Sheila Saunders.

But she can't help. She wasn't there.
Her daughter had a fever.

Didn't stay long?
I didn't check my watch.

I see. Well, thanks
for your cooperation.

Very welcome.
Tell me, do you know this girl?

Yeah, I don't know...

I don't remember where from.
What happened?

She fell down and broke her neck.
Did she?

I'll be in touch.

Don't you wanna leave me
your card, officer?

In case I remember anything? That's
what policemen usually do, right?

Must have given them all out.
How'd you find me?

I paid cash. No reservation.
How'd you find me?

Well, that's what we do, Mr. McCall.
We who?

We find people we need to find.

Just came for tea.

Just, uh...

Robert, I have very little influence
these days.

I'm not at the Agency anymore.

I consult on a few things. That's it.

Susan, I just need to know
who this man is.


Who is he to you?

That's why I'm here,
trying to find out.

Tell me what's going on. Please.

(???)

You had a nice funeral,
in case you were wondering.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

You know, when they told Susan
you were dead,

she couldn't comprehend it.

She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert."

"And not from something
as trivial as a car bomb."

That you're alive

is a big relief.

But it didn't come
as a complete surprise to her.

We used to talk about you
over the years, and she said

if anyone could have figured
a way out,

a way to walk away from it all
for good, you know,

like a real fresh start...

it would have been...

You.

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

(???)

SUSAN: <i>You didn't take out five pimps, Robert.</i>

You took out the East Coast hub
of Vladimir Pushkin.

ROBERT: Pushkin.
Mm-hm.

An oligarch who jumped in bed
with the Russian mafia,

only he funds everything: gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it.

He's built an intricate network
on both U.S. coasts

that are incredibly well-insulated.

His money and political ties
make him untouchable.

Your friend here is who Pushkin
sends when he's got a problem.

Teddy Rensen.
Real name, Nicolai Itchenko.

Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.

He's formidable and smart.

Ran a wing of the secret police
for years.

Went private when the Union fell.

Basically, he's a sociopath
with a business card.

ROBERT: Mm.

Thank you, darling.
You know these two?

Uh...

Boston P.D. Probably on
Pushkin's payroll, I assume.

Three years. Detective Remar
and Detective Pederson.

Only now they're dead.

They found them yesterday in the trunk of
their car in the precinct parking lot.

Suffocated. Testicles blown off
and shoved down their throats.

Classic Russian mob hit.
Teddy's work.

Third one, Detective Masters hasn't
shown up for work in several days.

Robert, I don't have to tell you
what happens next.

He won't stop until he kills you
and anyone you care about.

(???)

SUSAN: Didn't sleep a wink, did you?

Hey.

Mm.

Robert, that girl, Alina...

Why?

I couldn't tell you
why it mattered.

Why what they did to her,
that mattered to me so much.

One day somebody

does something unspeakable
to someone else to...

someone you hardly knew,

and you...

do something about it because you can.
Mm.

Because it's who you are? Hm?
Mm.

Who you've always been?

Sometimes we make the wrong choices
to get to the right place.

Mm.

I know a part of you died
when Vivian did.

But not the part
she loved the most.

(???)

Go be him.


Yep.

Don't forget to say goodbye.

You certainly have my attention.
Because I can keep going.

Brick by brick. Dollar by dollar.

Or you can call your boss and tell him
to shut down his operation.

Tonight.

That's not much of an offer.
Only one you're gonna get.

When you pray for rain,
you gotta deal with the mud too.

When you look at me...

what do you see?


Hm?

The answer's nothing.

I have no feelings about you
one way or the other. You're like...

Like lint or a bottle cap.

You're just a thing to remove.

I knew a Russian police captain
back in the day.

He told me about a case he worked on.
Can't remember the guy's name.

He was a famous scholar,
lived in Moscow.

He was a humanitarian,
an author.

Anyway, he decided to share his
abundance with someone less fortunate.

And even though he had five children,
he opened his home to a sixth.

An orphan, 12-year-old boy.

Kid had been pounded
by the system from an early age.

Troubled.

Prone to violence.
A lost cause.

Stop me if you know this one.
Oh, no. Carry on.

Okay. So this good man
opened his home to this boy.

And when the boy stole from him,
this good man loved him anyway.

When the boy failed in school, this man
showed understanding and patience.

When the boy lied and cheated
and clawed and fought,

this good man showed compassion
and love

until the boy, who had never felt
anything like being wanted or loved,

he finally did.

The man had broken through.
It was a miracle.

One week later, intruders broke
into the man's house.

Killed the man and his wife in bed.

They said some small things
were stolen,

things a child might steal.

No one knows for sure.

The man's children
were sent off to relatives.

The boy, the orphan,
shipped back to hell.

Just when he finally had a chance at life,
it was snatched away by two bullets.

It's a well-known story.
Mm. They ever catch who did it?

Did they?

Maybe they didn't look
in the right place.

Sometimes the answer's
in front of you.

(IN RUSSIAN)
I think the boy killed them.

(IN ENGLISH)
I think the boy did it.

The boy was scared his foster parents
would wake up one day

and realize he wasn't worth it,
like all the others had.

And he couldn't bear the thought
that this good man would do that to him.

Would throw him away...

like a piece of lint or a bottle cap.

So...

he decided not to find out.

What do you think, Nicolai?

You think you know me?


You strike me as
a sentimental man, Mr. McCall.

That's surprising.

I...

I don't possess that chip.

I never could understand what comes
from feeling that way

except weakness.

The men I killed, your men,

I gave them a chance.

They made their decision.

I'm giving you
the opportunity to make yours.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

You let me know...

when you decide.

Of course.

I've done some bad things
in my life, Nicolai.

Things I'm not proud of.

I promised someone
that I love very much

that I would never go back
to being that person.

But for you...

I'm gonna make an exception.

You asked me what I saw
when I looked at you.

What do you see when you look at me?

<i>? With no regrets ?</i>

<i>? A chance to watch ?</i>

<i>? Admire the distance ?</i>

<i>? Still occupied ?</i>

<i>? Though you forget ?</i>

<i>? Different colors, different shades ?</i>

<i>? Over each, mistakes were made ?</i>

<i>? I took the blame ?</i>

<i>? Directionless, so plain to see ?</i>

<i>? A loaded gun won't set you free ?</i>

<i>? So you say ?</i>

<i>? Feels like a close
It's coming to ?</i>

<i>? Fuck am I gonna do? ?</i>

<i>? It's too late to start over ?</i>

<i>? This is the only thing I
Thing I know ?</i>

<i>? Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is ?</i>

<i>? Find different ways
To word the same old songs ?</i>

<i>? Ever since I came along ?</i>

<i>? From the day the song called
"Hi, My Name Is" dropped ?</i>

<i>? Started thinking my name was "fault" ?</i>

<i>? 'Cause any time things went wrong ?</i>

<i>? I was the one
Who they would blame it on ?</i>

<i>? The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan ?</i>

<i>? Tried to argue
It was only entertainment, dog ?</i>

<i>? Gangsta? No
Courageous balls ?</i>

<i>? Had to change my style
They said I'm way too soft ?</i>

<i>? And I sound like AZ and Nas
Out came the claws ?</i>

<i>? And the fangs been out since then ?</i>

<i>? But up until the instant
That I went against it ?</i>

<i>? It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't
Amount to a shit-stain, I thought ?</i>

<i>? No wonder I had to unlearn everything
My brain was taught ?</i>

<i>? Do I really belong in this game?
I pondered ?</i>

<i>? I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not? ?</i>

<i>? So back and forth in my brain
The tug of war wages on ?</i>

<i>? And I don't wanna seem ungrateful ?</i>

<i>? Or disrespect the art form
I was raised upon ?</i>

<i>? But sometimes you gotta take a loss ?</i>

<i>? And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off ?</i>

<i>? And keep plugging
It's your only outlet ?</i>

<i>? And your only outfit
You know they're gonna talk about it ?</i>

<i>? Better find a way to counter it quick
And make it, ah ?</i>

<i>? Feel like I've already said this
A kabillion-eighty times ?</i>

<i>? How many times can I say the same
Thing different ways that rhyme? ?</i>

<i>? What I really wanna say is if there's
Anyone else that can relate to my story ?</i>

<i>? Bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are ?</i>

<i>? When I was afraid to ?
? I was afraid to make a single sound ?</i>

<i>? Afraid I would never find a way out ?</i>

<i>? Afraid I'd never be found ?</i>

<i>? I don't wanna go another round ?</i>

<i>? An angry man's power
Will shut you up ?</i>

<i>? Trip wires fill this house
With tip-toed love ?</i>

<i>? Run out of excuses for everyone ?</i>

<i>? So here I am and I will not run ?</i>

<i>? Guts over fear ?</i>

<i>? The time is near ?</i>

<i>? Guts over fear ?</i>

<i>? I shed a tear ?</i>

<i>? For all the times
I let you push me around ?</i>

<i>? And let you keep me down ?</i>

<i>? Now I got guts over fear
Guts over fear ?</i>

<i>? Feels like a close
It's coming to ?</i>

<i>? Fuck am I gonna do? ?</i>

<i>? It's too late to start over ?</i>

<i>? This is the only thing I
Thing I know ?</i>

<i>? I know what it's like
I was there once, single parents ?</i>

<i>? Hate your appearance ?</i>

<i>? Did you struggle to find your place
In this world? ?</i>

<i>? And the pain spawns
All the anger on ?</i>

<i>? But it wasn't till I put the pain in songs
Learned who to aim it on ?</i>

<i>? That I made a spark
Started to spit hard as shit ?</i>

<i>? Learned how to harness it
While the reins were off ?</i>

<i>? And there was a lot of bizarre shit
But the crazy part ?</i>

<i>? Was soon as I stopped saying
I gave a fuck ?</i>

<i>? Haters started to appreciate my art ?</i>

<i>? And it just breaks my heart
To look at all the pain I caused ?</i>

<i>? But what am I gonna do
When the rage is gone? ?</i>

<i>? And the lights go out
In that trailer park? ?</i>

<i>? And the window is closing and there's
Nowhere else that I can go with flows ?</i>

<i>? And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more
Emotion for me to pull from ?</i>

<i>? Just a bunch of playful songs
That I make for fun ?</i>

<i>? So to the break of dawn
Here I go recycling the same old song ?</i>

<i>? But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" ?</i>

<i>? Than make another motherfucking
"We Made You," unh ?</i>

<i>? Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs ?</i>

<i>? My demise and my uprise
Pray to God ?</i>

<i>? I just opened enough eyes later on ?</i>

<i>? Gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use it to make you strong ?</i>

<i>? Enough to lift yourself up
When you feel like I felt ?</i>

<i>? 'Cause I can't explain to y'all
How dang exhausted my legs felt ?</i>

<i>? Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk ?</i>

<i>? But thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me
The strength to cause Shady-mania ?</i>

<i>? So when they empty that stadium ?</i>

<i>? At least I made it out of that house ?</i>

<i>? And found a place in this world
When the day was done ?</i>

<i>? So this is for every kid
Who all's they ever did was dreamt ?</i>

<i>? Of one day just getting accepted ?</i>

<i>? I represent him or her
Anyone similar ?</i>

<i>? You are the reason
That I made this song ?</i>

<i>? And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more ?</i>

<i>? From this day forward
Just let them A-holes talk ?</i>

<i>? Take it with a grain of salt
And eat their fucking faces off ?</i>

<i>? The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I'm gone ?</i>

<i>? And to think I was gone ?
? I was afraid to make a single sound ?</i>

<i>? Afraid I would never find a way out ?</i>

<i>? Afraid I'd never be found ?</i>

<i>? I don't wanna go another round ?</i>

<i>? An angry man's power
Will shut you up ?</i>

<i>? Trip wires fill this house
With tip-toed love ?</i>

<i>? Run out of excuses for everyone ?</i>

<i>? So here I am and I will not run ?</i>

<i>? Guts over fear ?</i>

<i>? The time is near ?</i>

<i>? Guts over fear ?</i>

<i>? I shed a tear ??</i>
