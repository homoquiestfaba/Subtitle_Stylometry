<i>Top/essness-
female top/essness</i>

<i>was declared legal in New York
back in 1992,</i>

<i>where the highest court
in the state of New York said</i>

<i>that Where men can be topless,
as a matter of equal protection</i>

<i>under the laws,
Women can be topless</i> too.

<i>(man) This is a Channel 2 News specie!
report.</i>

<i>(woman) To update you
on the situation,</i>

<i>there has been a mass shooting
at a movie theater</i>

just outside Denver, Colorado,
<i>in</i> Aurora.

<i>According to the Aurora
Police Department,</i>

<i>a gunman acted alone,
opening fire on audiences</i>

<i>in two movie theaters,
at the premier</i>

of Batman: Dark Knight Returns.

<i>So far, Channel 2 News
has confirmed</i>

<i>that there are at /east
10 fatalities and 20 injured.</i>

<i>We'll have more information-</i>

[bluesy rock music]

<i>(woman)
Do you have a political agenda?</i>

<i>(Liv) Today, we were
wrongfully arrested,</i>

<i>as the chief of police
just admitted,</i>

and we were forced
by law to be let go.

So keep your laws
off our bodies.


Thank you.

You're welcome.

Let's wrap this up.

Liv?

Hello.
Who the fuck are you?

Sorry.
My name is With.

I write for News Corp,

and I was on Wall Street
when you were arrested.

Yeah, you want
to interview me?

Well, yes; I think I'd like
to do a piece on you.

Well, how 'bout this?

Next time, you join us,
and I will grant you

whatever interview you'd like.

Me topless?
I don't think so.

Why not?

Looks like you got
a nice pair under there.

Because I'm a journalist,
not an activist.

Do you have to be an activist

to agree that it's bullshit

that a man can
walk around shirtless

on a hot summer's day,

and a woman will get
arrested for it?

I never really thought
about it like that.

Well, how 'bout you
join us next time,

and I will think about
giving you an interview?

How 'bout you
give me an interview

and I'll think
about joining you?

I will win this game.

No, you won't.

Yes, I will.

[rock music]

<i>II</i>

Oh, good.
You're home. Uh...

I need two
rent checks,

because right now,
they're on the verge

of shutting off our cable,

which means no internet,

no email, no HBO, no connection

to the outside
world whatsoever.

I don't-l don't
get paid till Friday,

and I have, like,
$88 to my name.

Can you please pirate
the Wi-Fi from next door?

I have to finish this,
and I will-yeah.

You want me to
pirate the Wi-Fi.

Yeah.
From next door.

Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

Maybe you could
get a second job.

A job'?
Yeah.

Really?
Like what?

Waitressing.

Hosting, bartending,
stripping.

Stripping is a respectable-
it's an old profession.

First of all, there's
thousands of people

in line for every
job in the city,

and secondly,
concerning the pole,

I can't even get naked in front
of people I'm attracted to,

let alone random humans
throwing bills at me.

I'm not the
enemy here.

We're both in
the same prism.

Okay, I'm not mad
at you, I'm just-

I'm done.
I feel like you are mad at me.

'Cause you're not using
your indoor voice,

and now you're saying,
"I'm done, I'm done,"

and walking away
to the couch.

You can storm off
and dramatically sit

on the other side
of the room.

That's fine.
I'll match you on this.

I'll just stare you down

until you give me
your money.


If I don't sell
this story,

I promise, I'm gonna
sell my eggs, my plasma,

my-my blood-
whatever it takes.

Yeah.

I'm gonna get you
the money, okay?

<i>(With)
All right. Um,</i> so...

<i>ljust-ljust
want to get</i>

<i>some face basic facts
out of the way.</i>

0K3)'-

Bring it on, reporter girl.

<i>Please say your name and age.</i>

Liv. 23 years young.

<i>Where are you from'?</i>

Chicago, but I've been here
since I was 17.

<i>Where do you live'?</i>

Right now I'm squatting
in a basement in Red Hook.

<i>And what do your parents do'?</i>

They are professional hippies.

<i>And do you have a job?</i>

Um, I volunteer at this website
called "Magic Transistor."

It's really cool.

<i>[laughs]</i>

<i>Are you married?</i>

Are you hitting on me?

<i>No! No.</i>

<i>I-I'm just trying to get,
you know, the fuH picture.</i>

<i>What is your goal in going
topless in public places?</i>

To expose the double standard.

<i>Can you explain to me
the double standard?</i>

Absolutely.

Um, what I can't
get my head around

is that the nipple is the first
thing we see when we're born.

It nourishes us,
and then somehow,

the symbol of life
becomes illegal.

I mean, my own mother

was kicked out of church
for breastfeeding me.

And what's even more annoying
is that, while we're allowed

to see murder, violence,
and war on every channel,

Janet Jackson's nipple slips

and it becomes the fucking
crime of the century.

Furthermore,
I'm trying to bring about

more responsible representations
of female nudity,

because the only representations
that I see in mainstream culture

are ones that are totally
hypersexualized

and ones that make me question

what it means to be a woman
in modern society.

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>[laughing] How many times
have you been arrested?</i>

No comment.

<i>Why do you think
you keep getting arrested</i>

<i>for something
that's legal in New York?</i>

BSCGUSG COPS 3T6 FTIOFOHS.

<i>So why do you keep doing H'?</i>

It makes me feel good.

<i>Why don't you get a lawyer
next time?</i>

Um, I've thought about it.

Maybe you can
be in charge of that,

since you've promised
to join us next time.

<i>I did?</i>

Mm-hmm. You did.

<i>[laughs]</i>

<i>What if! don'???</i>

I will deny
everything in this interview.

<i>I should not have to use
an NFL halftime show</i>

<i>as a negative example
to teach my children.</i>

<i>Allowing tasteless
Super Bow! programming</i>

<i>is a nationwide entertainment
industry standard.</i>

<i>(Tunick) I even had a photograph
of 5O men and women's heads,</i>

<i>and then one woman's breast
was showing.</i>

<i>They had a problem with H,</i>

<i>and I said, "Why don't you
just blur it out?"</i>

<i>And they said, â€œOh, we don't
censor at The New York Times.â€œ</i>

<i>(woman) Right; there were-you
know, there were young chHdren.</i>

<i>There was a six-year-old.</i>

<i>(Stern) What is the
problem with people?</i>

<i>And I know that's
not the main issue here.</i>

<i>The six-year-old girl who died,
okay?</i>

<i>She died because she was,
unfortunately,</i>

<i>in the same spot as a lunatic.</i>

</i> have been at home, asleep.

<i>(Stern) At home asleep, at
home playing board games-</i>

<i>it's not about what time it was
or where she was at.</i>

<i>Batman is a scary movie.</i>

[phone ringing]

[melancholy music]

<i>II</i>

<i>I</i> It's okay to get away <i>I</i>

If you're in this
to change the world,

you're in the wrong business.

We have a dozen interns who can
write more palatable stories

for college credit and who
would love to have your job.

In fact, clear out your desk.

You're just
not working out here.

<i>I</i> Can't explain <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> All I see is,
all I see's a fight <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> If there's a way through
I'll not find it <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> I'll haul from it any reason <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Till I meet the dawn <i>I</i>

[door buzzes]

Liv, it's With. Call me back.

I'm on my way to you
right now.

Are you there?

[knocks on door]

Liv, it's With. Call me back.

I'm on my way to you right now.

Hey.

Ooh! Sorry.

I've been texting
you for hours.

Did you lose
your phone again?

No, I live in
a bomb shelter

and have 1/8 of
a bar of reception.


What?

Okay, you're
freaking me out.

Was there a
terrorist attack?

Should we flee?


L-I couldn't
sell the story.

L-I called and I pleaded
and I begged everyone I knew.

Who's everyone?

<i>Post, The Times,
interview.</i>

So none of the paparazzi
that were there-

none of them
printed anything.

No.

Not even a blog?

L-I tried.


Liv, I think if you want
to impact mass culture

in America, you need to take
this to the next level.

I think you need
to go really big.

National publicity stunts.
Viral campaigns.

Armies of women
in every single city.

I think you need
to make so much noise

that these policy-makers
have no other choice

but to listen.

With, I can't afford
to eat at a restaurant.

Where am I gonna get
the cash for a revolution?

We'll find the money.

We'll start a nonprofit.

We're gonna make it work.

We?

What do you mean, "we"?

What are you saying,
Snow White?

I'm saying I just lost my
job over this article,

I'm about to get evicted,

and I have nothing
left to lose.

You honestly believe that we can
change the laws in this country?

Yeah.

[car horn blaring]

[funky electronic music]

Orson!

Orson!

<i>II</i>

Orson!

<i>II</i>

Orson!

What's that on your head?

Check for fucking $5,000.

Why'd you put it on your head?

That's a dumb place
to put a check.

Yeah; let's go pig out,
like, now.

Okay. Yeah. I'm down.

How much of that
did you see?

Like, all of it,
or just the end part?

[indistinct chatter]

Do you honestly believe

that we can change the laws
in this country?

Do you want to hear
a quote that sums up

my entire theory of life?

<i>(Liv)
Okay</i>

<i>(With)
First they ignore you,</i>

<i>then they laugh at you,</i>

<i>then they fight you,</i>

and then you win.

<i>(Liv)
Who said that?</i>

<i>(With)
Mahatma Gandhi.</i>

It's very optimistic.

Yeah.

<i>I We got money I</i>

I mean, money
isn't really real.

If you think about it,

it's like pretty colored paper

and lots of numbers
in a computer.

Uh, that's the single dumbest
thing you've ever said.


Money is 100% real.

Well.

It's the realest
thing I know.

This is real.

That's for me?
Mm-hmm.

You are such
a good friend.


For rent and cable

and 500 for all the takeout
you've been buying.

Well, I'm not gonna
take money for takeout.

Why aren't you gonna
take money for takeout?

What? Because that's
just me as a friend

buying you lunch.

Just take it.
I'm not-no.

Because no.

Just receive.

Fine.
Okay.

I'm not happy
about it,

and I'll hold
this against you.

[phone beeps]

Oh, Jim Black.

Jim Black?

Who's that?

Inquiring minds
want to know.

Yeah, yeah.

This DC PR guy that
I worked with at the paper

finally texted me back.

DC PR guy?

What do you mean you're
texting a DC PR guy?

I am starting...

a full-scale
culture revolution.

Seriously?
Yeah.

And I need help.

<i>L-l'm-</i>

And listen
before you-

and it involves
a lot of women.

I might be able
to make time.

Look at-look.

How single are...
most of them?

<i>I</i> And they took you <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Right on by <i>I</i>

So.
Hey.

Remember when you said
we should get a lawyer

to come with you to your
next topless protest?

Yeah; that
was your idea.

Okay, well,
I looked into it,

and these lawyers who
specialize in freedom of speech

have agreed to represent us
in New York and nationwide.

Oh, my god! Ah!

Freeing nipples
state by state.

Amazing.

One by one.

So are you
gonna do it too?

What?

Go topless.

Oh, my god.

Sure. Maybe. Maybe.

If I'm surrounded
by other women,

but that's not the point, Liv!

Okay, okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry.

So how much is this
gonna cost us?

$3,000 to put them
on retainer,

which is a deal-
believe me.

But where are we
gonna get that money?

Ta-da!

What is that?

Severance check
from the paper.

$5,000.

Consider me your
first investor.

Whoo!


Thank you, With.

You're welcome.

Oh, wow. Uhh...

Uh, do you have any issues with

being topless
in public places?


I made a resolution this year

to try more new,
scary things, so...

that sounds really scary.

Yeah.

It says that you
have special skills.

Yeah, um, I know Final Cut,
Excel, Photoshop,

Java, Drupal...

And my grandmother
was a Black Panther.

That's so cool.

<i>Head Malcolm X.</i>

The description says
campaign experience,

film and editing skills wanted,

must be comfortable
with public nudity.

[both laughing]

Um, can I be arrested?

Yeah.

Where do you stand on pasties?

Do you have
any objections

to going undercover inside
government organizations

to free this country from
oppression and censorship?

Fuck yeah.

Do you have any issues

getting topless
in public places?

Thank you.
That's great.

Thank you.

Um, you guys are
both filmmakers.

Oh, l-l'm sorry.

I didn't know you guys
didn't speak English,

but that's great that
you guys are here.

I mean, I guess I would have
to tell my husband about it.

My tits are in.

I'm free tomorrow.

That's great.


All right.

[funky percussive music]

<i>II</i>

<i>I</i> I need toI

<i>I To see you I</i>

<i>I</i> Won't you come around <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Won't you come on down <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> I need toI

<i>I To see you I</i>

<i>I</i> Won't you come on down <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Won't you come around <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Hold on, little fellas <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> You don't know
if she's a goer <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> But you keep
calling her over <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> Calling her,
calling her over <i>I</i>

<i>II</i>

What's going on?
Are we fucked?

It's working.

Officers, excuse me.
What's going on here?

These women are my clients,

and we have legal permits
for this demonstration.

Now, according
to statute 245.01,

the Court of Appeals
of New York has ruled

that the exposure
of a bare female breast

violates no exposure laws.

And so on behalf of my clients,
for violation of this statute,

I'm officially issuing you
a lawsuit.

For their wrongful arrest
on Wall Street,

September the 15th of 2012.

Suing them for
'IO million, huh'?

I mean, it was
just a PR stunt.

It'll probably
get thrown out.

Our lawyers thought
it would-

it would lure the press
into covering it.

Should've called me.

What do you mean?

Well, you know I would've
leaked it to Reuters.

In seconds, you could've
been out to 150 countries

in 6O languages.

I think you are tapping into
the first-and probably most-

important amendment
to the constitution:

Freedom of religion,
freedom of speech,

press, assembly.

Do you know that we are 37th
in the press freedom index?

There are 36 other countries

that have a freer press
than we do.

36.

Who's the worst?
North Korea?

Eritrea.

It's a little
tiny country

in East Africa
near the Red Sea.

Jim.

I know that you're-
that you're crazy busy,

but we need somebody
who knows this world,

somebody that can help us
connect the dots.

We need a consigliere,
a Yoda.

A Yoda?


Big shoes to fill.

I just don't know
how this is gonna sit

in the big, bad world.

Yeah.

How's the paper?

Oh, I'm done working
for dinosaurs.

You quit.

No, I got fired.

Oh.

Fuck 'em.

Okay, With,
here's what I can do.

Let me percolate on it.

If something
sifts to the top,

I'll give you a buzz.

Okay?

<i>I</i> Ay, oh, ay-oh-eeh-oh, oh <i>I</i>

<i>I Ay, oh, ay-oh-eeh-oh, oh I</i>

<i>I Ay, oh,
ay-oh-eeh-oh, oh I</i>

He's percolating.

Define percolating.

I mean,
his schedule's nuts,

but he's gonna
make it work.

Oh, my God.
This is huge.

Uh! Yeah.

what are you coloring'?

I'm color-coding the states

that women can legally
be topless in.

How many states in America

is the nipple actually legal?

12.

All right, nips.

This is our hit list.

Whoa!
What am I looking at?

Well, it's a list of 32
good-and bad-guys

that we're targeting
as of now.

Madonna? Lady Gaga?

Katie Couric?

For a campaign
of this magnitude,

we're gonna need to
form a coalition

of like-minded organizations

and reach out to
high-profile people

who will champion
our cause in the media.

How do you expect us
to just reach out

to these huge,
iconic names?

Easy; we just call
their handlers-

their humans-and say,
"Hey, we are on the front lines

"fighting for your freedom.

"You don't want to give us

"ten minutes
of your client's time?

Then let karma fall
where it may."

That's a really
nice theory,

but back here on Earth,
what makes you think

these people are even
gonna talk to us?

Cali, everyone in the world
is hungry for something real.

Our currency is meaning.

You're joking, right'?

No, I'm not joking.

I mean, even icons-

icons who have everything
in the world-

at the end of the day,
they realize

all they have
is themselves.

They want meaning
in their lives.

It's the only thing
that they can't buy,

but we can give it to them.


Hey, we have that meeting.

What meeting?

Uh, that meeting
with the investors.

Oh-oh, with the investor.

Yeah. Okay, great.

So I'll see you guys later.

See (Liv)
you guys.

What do you think?

Maybe I'll take, like-

That girl
is a button-pusher.

It's not her.
It's her programming.

She just needs a new
operating system.

Well, she's a
contradictarian.

She's working
her ass off for free.

Whatev; she cannot
be talking to us like that

in front of the peeps.

Okay
Rooftop'?

Rooftop.
Let's go.

[soothing music]

<i>I</i> Just now <i>I</i>

<i>I You took away my breath I</i>

<i>I</i> I can't feel my lips <i>I</i>

<i>I</i> I burst <i>I</i>


<i>I</i> I burst <i>I</i>

A dream you dream alone
is only a dream.

A dream you dream together
is a reality.

Did you just make that up?

Nah, it's John Lennon.

You realize you quote some
genius at least twice a day.

Sorry. I just love quotes.

I love their timelessness.

I love how they can lift
people's minds, you know?

So we're not firing her.

No.



<i>I</i> When you're near <i>I</i>

<i>I Song returns to me I</i>

Why are you still
wearing a bra?

I don't know.
Someone might see.

Who cares if people see?
That's the point.

Whatever.
Just stay there.

With.

Isn't the point
that people see?


<i>'L</i>


That speaks volumes.

Drop the bra.

Free your mind.

Drop the bra.

Just like that?
Just like that.

All right.
All right.

Whoo!

Whoo.

Aww-whoo!

Whoo!

Whoo!

<i>(Cali) You know I
appreciate your optimism,</i>

but you do realize
that societies and religions

have been oppressing women
for countless millennia.

This is not going
to change overnight.

I hope you
know that.

Yeah, but you know what,
you have to remember

that humans and animals

and even bugs
at a deep DNA level-

they want to be free.

I'm just merely curious
as to why you think

that you-we can
change something

that has never been
able to have been changed

in the history of ever.

Why us? Why now?
What makes us so unique?

We live
in a technological age

of social media,
where one idea

can reach more people
in one week

than Jesus, Buddha,
or Moses could reach

in over thousands
of years.

Let's be careful
comparing ourselves

to Buddha and Jesus, okay?

Besides, that's
all relative.

There are way more
people on this Earth now

than there were
5,000 years ago.

Yeah, but at the rate
you can reach people

overnight is in
the millions.

I mean, look what
happened in Egypt.

That started
with one guy

and one Facebook page.

I'm not sure how accurate
that statement is,

but listen.

In political
movements especially,

the lines between
delusion and reality

can become very blurry.

So how about I will
stay realistic,

and you two
stay optimistic,

and we meet somewhere
in the middle.

Ifucking love
this ice cream.

I think the poster
should look like

a piece of Elle's
street art.

Yes.

I think I know someone
who knows her.

Want any text
on the poster?

Tagline?

Free the Nipple.

Right.

Free the Nipple
it is then.

[laughs]
Yeah!

Dude, we seriously need
a bigger place to work.

I mean, one bathroom?

There's no workspaces.

It's like a mini
Big Brother in here.

I know; you're
preaching to the choir.

But what do you
want me to do?

You want to go
work outside?

You want to work
on the roof-what?

All right, you guys.

It's still
under construction,

but we needed
a bigger space, so...

Oh, my God.

What do you guys think?

Things aren't really
together yet,

but we have it for free
for as long as we want.

What?

Too rustic, huh?

When can we move in?

Now.

Really?

Yeah.


We're inside a pool.

[upbeat rock music]

<i>II</i>

The first film
I make here

was word-for-word,
scene-by-scene remake

ofafilm
I do in Europe.

But after we
lock picture,

MPAA destroy.

They take out
nudity, drug-

you know, anything
that was "too real."

But why-why did you
let them do that?

You get NC 17 is like
pornography, right?

You know,
theaters don't release,

no DVD, no Walmart.

I mean, honestly,
lfeel like

we're in a fucking Communist
country right now.

You're not, but,
you know, growing up,

you all the time hear
America's home of the free,

but after I work here,
I think it's more repressed

than I imagined.

we're ready for you.

Yes, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Burt sends me video.
Very good.

I like.
So you need money?

<i>Oh, uh, yeah.</i>

Money would be great.

How much you need
and what you need this for?

[soft rock music]

<i>I</i> I want to be out <i>I</i>

Here's what you're up against.

In 1980,
religious organizations

mobilized and put Reagan
in the White House.

Basically, from that moment,
the Republicans made an alliance

with the Christian right,
and when puritans

start manipulating politicians
and hijacking government,

that's when censorship laws
get weird.

Here's how it works:

Let's say there is a television
show like Skins,

where you have teenagers
having sex,

ingesting drugs,
etcetera, etcetera.

I like that show.

Here's why it's no longer
on in the U.S.:

Groups like the PTO
rally their religious base,

send e-mails and phone calls
to DC, to the <i>FCC,</i>

to the press, to the networks,
and, in Skins' case, MTV.

The sponsors freak out.

They pull their ads.

MTV freaks out.

No more money?

Puritanical ideology,
meet commerce.

Shows off the air.

But Jim, how do we
go up against

these huge Goliath
institutions?

I mean, I just
feel that we're

slightly outgunned here.

Okay; first thing
you have to understand is

this is not about fighting.

I'm pretty sure she
meant metaphorically.

Metaphorically,
literally,

you got to forget
about this idea of fighting.

Whatever you fight
grows stronger.

That's very Zen of you,
but I'm asking

how do we change the
censorship laws in America?

This is not about politics.

This is about the hearts
and minds of the people.

You want to
shake things up,

take a page out of the Christian
right's book.

Use the same tactics they employ
on your cause.

We're a product of this
puritanical culture,

but let me ask you this:

who do you think runs the world?

The 1%.

No.

The Illuminati.

No. You do.

The people.

When the masses align,

Rome falls, Egypt falls,
it all falls down.

In theory, but-

No, not in theory.
In real time.

What do you think all those
little religious groups

across the great unwashed
are made of?

A bunch of people.

What you need is a
state-of-the-art campaign

that will be the
butterfly wing

that will trigger
the tsunami

of signatures
to petitions.

You drive to Washington
via social media.

When you reach
your critical mass,

I'll take care
of the press.

CNN, Fox, BBC.

I'll make a few
phone calls,

and suddenly, the great
media monster's eyes

will turn toward you...

for 15 minutes.

Maybe 15 seconds.

In that moment...

What are you gonna say?

We researched the name
"Topless Warriors,"

and it's already been taken
by some group in Russia.

What?

Are you fucking my tits?

Orson!

Hey. What's up?

Talk to me.
Who are these girls?

Uh, these are Femen.

According to this site,
they have over 300 members.

And they protested issues
ranging from

the plight
of the Ukrainian prostitute

to the election
of President Putin.

Wow. These humans are hardcore.

How did they get
so much press?

They're smart.

They target high-profile,
international events

like Davos and elections.

They hit the Vatican.

Wow.

We need to do that.
What?

Storm high-profile
landmarks

with thousands
of topless women.

What's equivalent
to the Vatican in America?

St. Patrick's Cathedral?

Probably the
White House, right?

Yes!
We need to invade DC.

Uh, With, can I talk to you
just for a second?

Yeah.

Uh, we're gonna
go get some food.

Would you guys
want anything?

Yeah.
Could you grab some Dunkaroos?

Du n karoos'?
What's that'?

It's the cookie
with the kangaroo.

They're shaped
in a kangaroo,

and you drop
them into the-

The kangaroojumps
into the cream.

It's like the little, um...

[all speaking at once]

I know what they are.
Come on.

0K3)'-

varieties they have.

Chocolate and vanilla.

And some-some
string cheese.

We should try
to get in touch

with that porn star
that's in parliament too.

Whatfi up'?

Nothing.
Come on.

Well, we have
a problem.

Yeah.

Roz, tell her.
What is it?


L-I ran the numbers
and the invoices

and the receipts,
and as of now,

we're down to $397.21.

And, girls, if we're seriously
planning on producing a campaign

with thousands of women in DC,
we're gonna need real money,

or this whole thing
is going to fall apart.

not going to fall apart,

chicken little.

The universe has a plan.

In quantum physics,
they have proven

that space and time
are illusions.

So if time doesn't
really exist,

then the impact that we
are going to make-

we've
already made-

and everything that we
are going to do,

we've already done.

Liv, I don't need the
Carl Sagan explanation.

All I need to know
is do we have money?

Because, like, the wall-

We're at it.

<i>'LNL</i>


I have to start
looking for a job.

Seriously; I'm not
even kidding anymore.

We're in the middle
of a revolution.

You can't get a job.

I have to pay rent
in four days,

and my phone's about
to get cut off.

With, you cannot afford

the luxury of a negative
thought right now.

We-we're out of money,
and we need a plan.

Well, Cali had
an idea, but, well...

But what?

All right, well,
you know those websites

where you can
upload a video

to get people to care
about your cause,

and they can donate to you?

Yeah, like Kickstarter.
Yeah, exactly.

Well, we could
make a viral video

right now if we wanted to.

We've got iPhones.

And shoot what?

All right.

Heads, I run topless
through Times Square

and you film.

Tails, you run topless
through Times Square

and I film you.

No. No. No.

I mean, in front
of you is one thing,.

But in front of
complete strangers?

I mean, that's in my
top ten worst fears ever,

right next to
being buried alive.

No.

No what?

No.

You know, you can't
be halfway pregnant.

You can't be
half-committed, either.

What's it gonna be?

Yes or no?

All right.

Flip the
fucking coin!

Run, run, run!]

Go!

Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Come on.

Hey, hey.

Hey.

I don't know what she's doing.
She's not answering her phone.

I don't know.

How bad is it?

It's bad.

They're charging her
with disturbing the peace,

resisting arrest,
reckless assault.

Reckless assault?
For what?

How much is the bail?

$25,000.

$25,000?

With, where are you going?

To bail her out.
What do you think?

Come on.
Let's go.

Is there any way around paying
for this permit, Jim'?

I have a money problem.

<i>(Jim) Uh, you could ceH
it performance art</i>

<i>and get a permit
and set up a temporary</i>

<i>art museum for free.</i>

That's brilliant.

Why didn't we do that
to begin with?

<i>H's risky.</i>

<i>Most curators don't want
the controversy.</i>

There's no guarantee
<i>you'll</i> get the permit.

<i>With? You there?</i>

Jim, let's do it.

<i>Are you sure?</i>

Yes.

We require a 10% deposit,

so for you, that's $2,500.

As soon as we-you know, as soon
as we get the check from you,

we can get her out of there.

Thanks.
Yep.

[car horn blaring]

Roz, how much money
do we have in the bank?

The next check
just cleared.

It's, like, $1,500.

You cannot use that money
for bail.

That money is for DC.

We're getting her out.

She's the reason this
whole thing started.

I should be the one
in jail.

So you're just gonna
jeopardize our entire plan

to get Liv out of jail?

No. There's another way.

We can get permits for free.

What are you talking about?

I spoke to Jim, and he said
that if we get museums

to sponsor us, we'll be fine.

And if we can't?

Then that's-that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

Okay, look.

I know how you feel.

We all love Liv.

This is much bigger
than her now.

Okay?
You cannot do this.

I'm not letting her stay
in jail one more hour,

and that's final.

That's final?

Who says?

I say. Not happy?

Walk away.

You know what?
That's a good idea.

That's what I'm gonna
do right now.

I'm gonna walk away.

What?
Cali, stop.

Don't.

What are you doing?

We need her.

We don't need Cali.

We need Liv.

We still need
another thousand dollars.

(R
Are yo Lfgkayv

for you all night.

Every revolution
meets resistance,

and that's when
things get real.

Roz, I appreciate
the halftime speech,

but we're broke, and Liv
is in jail indefinitely.

We're done.

The whole thing just...
is dead.

It's not dead.

It's not dead.

It got hit by a freight train,
sure, but it is not dead.

With, do you even remember
why you hired me?

I don't know,
'cause you're cool

and you were willing
to work for free.

No.

She didn't even
read my resume.

Before this, I threw
events and fundraisers.

This is what I do.

Liv is a political prisoner.

This is more than enough
to get people together

to throw a bail party.

Are you serious?

It's not that complicated.

We just get a venue,
some cheap liquor

and food, and-boom!

She's out of jail.

Boom.
Yeah. Boom.

Now get the fuck up
off the floor.

Our fearless leader

is probably rotting
in a jail cell

on a dirty,
urine-stained floor

getting gang-banged.

Liv, oh,
you so pretty!

Come on.

Let this be
your motivation.

Get up.

[hip-hop music]

<i>II</i>

We are organizing
a massive protest

with thousands of
topless women in DC.

But the real goal is to get
on the floor of Congress,

speak to them about the fact
that there are these

censorship giants that control
the flow of nudity and violence

into our theaters
and our televisions.

Yes.

I think you'd be a great
ally for our cause.

Hold on one second.
Hey, With!

Come here.
Orson.

Guys, this is Dave.

Dave,
With and Orson.

Hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

Dave is an investor
and his family

is in the beef
and cattle industry

and he's really interested
in helping us out.

Why don't you tell him
about what we're doing?

Yeah, so we're trying
to hack social media,

democratize the internet.

We're trying to just
kill censorship

once and for all
in this country.

And the leader
of our movement

got arrested
for a public stunt.

Yes.
And bail is $25,000.

Whoa.

So we're trying to raise
some money to get her out.

Awesome.

Why don't I get you a drink?
Do you want a drink?

Let me get you drink.

Miss bartender, do you
have any Everclear?

Yeah. Sure.

With, With,
With, With, With!

I want you to meet-
so Alexandria,

this is With and...

. Pippi-
. Pippl-

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

So we're helping them raise
money for the campaign,

and now it seem for trial
and bail money too, yeah?


So, tell about Revolution.

It's not exactly
a revolution, see,

'cause revolution-

Pardon.

'Cause revolution
implies revolve,

like something that spins

but comes back
to the same place.

We want to
transcend that.

It's time to evolve.

Yeah, this is more
of an evolution.

Next level.

A cultural operating
system upgrade.

Hello.
Hi. I'm drunk.

Me, too.
Nice to meet you.

This is my friend.

I'm gonna take her away
for a moment...

Okay.
If that's okay with you.

Okay. Very good.

Have fun.
Onwards and upwards!

Yes.

Orson, I need a drink.

Hi. How are you doing?

Um, can I get
another whiskey, please?

[muffled music playing]

<i>II</i>

Hey, how goes
that revolution?

We raised $450,

but her bail's $25,000.

We still have
to pay the bond

and hire a lawyer.

No. No, no, no.

Jim, stop.

Please, you've
helped me out so much.

Stop.
Oh, cut it out.

Here; just fill it out
for what you need.

Don't go crazy.

Okay. Get back.

Kiddo, come on.

I love you too.
Come on.

You're like a bunny.


I'm excited.


Hey!

Oh!
Look at that.

A vision.
VVhoo!

To the most beautiful
humans on Earth.

I love you all
unconditionally.

Give Cali and Roz
some love.

They're the real reason
why you're out of prison.

I'm sorry...

For being such a bitch
all the time.


Do you forgive me?


I guess I have to.

Oh, my God!
Ew! Ew!


Slimy!

Greasy fucking kiss.

Do you wash your face?
No!

I knew you had
a crush on me.

She did!

I've been so rude all along.

You totally did. Oh, my God.

That was...
I love that shit.

I love that shit!
Make...

That was make-out session!

[indistinct chatter]

Cali, what's happening with DC?

I'm trying to get the
permits for 10,000 women

at the Lincoln Memorial.

Why the Lincoln Memorial?

MLK, Forrest Gump-
it's the venue.

I thought we were trying to
get on the floors of Congress.

With, DC is a fucking
logistical nightmare, okay?

It is not happening.

Hello?

Ready to see some propaganda?

I want to see! I want to see!
Yay!

I want to see!
What?



Whoa.
These are great!

I finally got
a hold of Elle,

and she requested
a meeting with you.

Oh, my God.
You got Elle?

You got Elle?
Who's Elle?

Oh, my God.
Who's Elle?

She's everywhere.

She's next up.

Bomit, Banksy,
The London Police.

She's the next bullet
in the barrel.

So when are you
free to meet?

Now.

Yay!
Yay!

Yay!
Yeah!

So Milk's driving us to
an undisclosed location.

You need to put this
ski mask on, all right?

You're safe.
You can take it off.

So Kilo told me that
you're organizing

a big event in DC.

Yeah, we're planning
on getting permits

for 10,000 topless
women to assemble

at the Lincoln Memorial,
and we would love

for you to get involved
in any possible way.

When is it?

We're trying to do it
before the elections.

<i>Hm.</i>

Here's what I can do.

A week before
your event,

I can trigger my teams
to carpet-bomb and tag

the entire
tri-state area.

Wow.
Wow.

But there's a problem.

What's the problem?

Yeah, what's-

What's your identity?

What's your name?

Free the nipple?

Yeah.

You don't like it?

I mean, it's
a catchy phrase.

I don't mean to offend,
but it's a tagline.

It's not an identity.

You want to know
who I think you are?

Yeah.

Girlrillaz.

I love it.

Fucking brilliant.

[rock music]

<i>Basia, per favore.</i>

<i>I am aware that the Vatican
are accusing my show</i>

<i>of being sinful
and blasphemous.</i>

<i>I do not endorse a way of life
but describe one,</i>

<i>and the audience is left
to make its own decisions</i>

<i>and judgment.</i>

<i>This is what I consider
freedom of speech,</i>

<i>freedom of expression,
and freedom of thought.</i>

<i>If you do not believe
in these freedoms,</i>

<i>you, the Catholic church,</i>

<i>are imprisoning
everyone's minds.</i>

I would have
that woman's babies.

Do you think we'll actually
get to Madonna?

If it's in the stars.

Oh, no more quotes.

Ready? Come on.
It's for our DC speech.

All right.

"In a country
where obscenity

"is defined, in large,
by things sexual

"instead of things related
to war and killing and hatred,

what kind of world is that?"

Who said that?
Hugh Hefner.

I love it,
but he's a pornographer.

Well, then you're gonna
hate this quote.

"I think the real obscenity
comes from raising our youth

"to believe that sex is bad
and ugly and dirty

"and yet it is heroic
to go spill guts and blood

in the most ghastly manner
in the name of humanity."

Who said that?

Let me finish.
It's Larry Flint.

"But ask yourself
this question.

What is more obscene,
sex or war?"

That's my line.
He stole my line.

You weren't even born
when this speech was made.

Whatever; it's
just a confirmation

of my inspiration.


<i>(With) Every day,
the</i> media <i>plays</i>

glorified images
of violence

<i>instead of showing the-</i>

<i>Fact." over two million
juveniles every year</i>

<i>are incarcerated
for violent crimes.</i>

Fact." on average, <i>32</i> people

<i>are killed by handguns
every single day-</i>

<i>Behavioral science shows
that children</i>

<i>under the age of eight
can't tell the difference</i>

<i>between reality and fantasy,
making them vulnerable</i>

<i>to adopting the violence-</i>

<i>Kids like to imitate
their heroes,</i>

<i>and so many of our heroes</i>

<i>solve problems
through killing and violence.</i>


Uh!


Don't.

Wake up.

When did you
go to bed?

4:00 or 5:00.

Ugh!

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

I finished my speech.

Really?

Do you want to read it?
Yes.

Can we do it outside, though?

I need nature.

I love this.
I love this.

Which one?

"Democracy don't
rule the world.

"You better get that
in your head.

"This world is ruled
by violence,

but I guess that's
better left unsaid."

Dylan.

I love it.

You do?
Yes.

You mean it?
Yes!

[indistinct chatter]

Incoming!

Whoa!
Here it is.

A little surprise.

A little homage to our
sisters in Pussy Riot.

Oh, shit.

[punk rock music]

<i>II</i>

Free the nipple!

Free the nipple!

Hey!
Free the nipple!

<i>II</i>

Nipple!

Hey, this guy!

You know what I read?

I read once that if
you take the best orgasm

you've ever had, right?

And you multiply it
times 100,

it's literally
a drop in the bucket

compared to the bliss you
feel from enlightenment.

Well, no wonder
organized religions

hate pleasure
for pleasures sake.

You can't generalize
religion.

Yes, I can;
they demonize it.

They make you feel
guilty about it.

My entire childhood,
I thought that God

was up there
watching me fuck myself

in my bathtub.

[both laughing]

Why are you so obsessed
with masturbating?

I'm not obsessed.

I just need a variety
of ways to get turned on.

Huh.
For example.

I have started
masturbating

to videos of myself
masturbating.

Like this masturbation
via feedback loop.

No way.
Yeah. It's amazing.

I actually came.

Like ejaculated.

Stop.

You've never
ejaculated before?

Oh, my God.
Stop.

You're making
this shit up.

You really are.
No, I'm not.

I swear.

It's amazing.

So hang on.

Let me-let me ask
you a question.

Yeah.

So you-you
masturbate

to videos of yourself
masturbating.

Yes.

It is so narcissistic,

but it totally works.

Jesus Christ!

Fucking douche-bag.

We're talking
about orgasms!

Orgasms!

Yeah, if we can actually,
like, collaborate

and morph it into one event,
that would be amazing.

Yeah; I think
that would be so disruptive.

Thank you.
Oh, my God.

Spencer, you have no idea.

You are my God today!

Yes.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Okay. Yeah.

We'll send you
all the information.

Okay. Bye.

Get your ass in here!

<i>I On chaniaii peiii saucisson!</i>

Oh, my God.

What?
We are so lucky.

You know who just
contacted me right now'?

Who?
SpencerTunick.

Amazing.

He's huge.

So he's gonna be
collaborating with us.

Kick ass!

[inhales sharply and sighs]

Oh, I thought we were gonna
do the other one from now on.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh. Okay.

Uh, you go like this.

Yeah.

Oh.

Got your fingers.
Yeah.

[both laughing]

[Liv singing in French]

[phone ringing]

Oh. Jim Black.

Oh. Whoa.

Hello?

<i>(Jim) With, they aren't
gonna give us the permits.</i>

Wh-what do you mean?

I thought you said
you could do this.

<i>Pm sorry.</i>

<i>I tried.
I couldn't convince them.</i>

<i>The museum's afraid
it will endanger their budget.</i>

<i>Pm sorry, With.</i>

<i>wish I had better news.</i>

All right.

I have to figure
something out, Jim.

Bye.

What?

We lost the permits.

What?

It's over.

I fucked this up.

It's okay, okay?

We'll figure
something else out.

You know?
Forget DC.

This is all my fault.


With, look at me.

Look at me.

I feel like I'm letting
everybody down, you know?

You didn't let me down.

Sorry.

It's-um.

I don't know
why I did that.

That was really weird.

I wasn't, like, um,
planning on doing that

or anything.

Where are you going?

Uh, I'm going out.

With, you still have
a towel on your head.

And you're-you're
not wearing shoes.


Sorry.

Cali, who's your
contact in DC?

Give me the number.

I want to call them.

What is it that you think
you're going to accomplish?

Cali, please
give me the number.

Look; I don't know how many
times I have to tell you this.

Everything is booked,
and even if it wasn't,

we can't get permits.

Organizing thousands
of topless women

costs a shitload of money
we don't have.

Uh, pardon me
for a second.

We're looking for
eyeballs, right?

Obviously.

Well, so I mean,
how do you get attention

in this day and age, you know?

Just, like, get some sort
of viral hit count

Bieber, Gangnam Style,
cat baby thing, right?

No, no, no, no.

You are not suggesting
we are doing a music video.

I'm not, but it's
a valid art form.

Look; what I'm saying
is what do you do

when you have an
important message

that you want to get
out to the people?

your Facebook status.

Okay, but to more people.

You know? To the world.

If you want to announce
you're running for president...

Press conference.

Hold a press conference.
Exactly.

0K3)'-

So you've got your friend
Jim, right?

He's got the press
in his pocket.

Why don't we put
all that together

and grab a microphone...

But why would
anyone else care?

Yeah, no one's gonna give
three shits about some speech.

No offense.

Yeah. It's true.

Unless you're topless.

Well, what's the hook?

Okay, what would be
so undeniable

that the press would
have to cover it?

Wait.

This is the perfect opportunity
for us to just

wreak some serious
street-art havoc.

Can we define
havoc quickly?

Before this goes-

And we don't have
any bail money.

Just hear me out.
It's just a thought.

What if, on Halloween,
while the cops are busy,

we got Kilo and Elle
to just go out on the street

and paste Free
the Fucking Nipple everywhere.

So that when everybody wakes up
on November 1st,

it's like the first snow.

Yes. Yes.

I like where you're
going with this.

Keep going.
Okay. Great.

And then the next day,
we hold a press conference,

and we take full responsibility
for the terrorist act.

lfucking love it. I love it.

I'm gonna-l'm gonna
call Jim right now.

I'm on it, guys.

<i>(Jim)
What day are you gonna do this'?</i>

November 1st.


Jim, did you-
did you read my speech?

<i>Yeah.</i>

The topless thing
is the Trojan horse,

but the real dialogue
that's happening

is about violence.


<i>Your movement
is becoming poignant.</i>

Great. Thank you.

Well, let me off the phone.

I got some calls to make.

Okay, cool. Thank you.

Bye.

[phone keys beeping]


Hey, Cathy.

Yeah, it's Jim.

Is he there?

Well, get him out
of that meeting.

[ethereal music]

<i>II</i>

Hey, uh, With?
Yeah.

Come check this out.

I edited some
stuff together.

It's-it's very rough,
but it can give you

sort of a general idea
of what is going on.

Oh, that's-
you finished it.

It's not finished.
Everyone!

No, it's not finished.
People! Humans!

Stop.
Come and watch this.

Orson just
finished the cut.

It's a rough
cut, though.

Not finished, so don't
judge too harshly.

Wait. There.

We live in oppressive times.

We, as a nation,

Jesus Christ is one of the most
historic victims of censorship,

and Pontius Pilate
was his censor.

And even more disturbing,
every-

and even more-ahh!

And even more disturbing...

Concern for commercial
viability...

Pontius Pilate was his censor.

And if you hate freedom,
move to China.

Censorship, censorship,
censorship

is an obvious hallmark of any
fascist, tyrannical regime.

Hey.

Hey.

It's 4:00 a.m.

Oh.

You must crash.

We've got a big
night tomorrow.

Fuck.

This is really happening.

Yeah.

It is.

Oh, and we have to
call a lawyer

to arrange for some
bail money,

because someone
is definitely-

definitely
getting arrested.

Yeah.

You nervous?

Yeah.

Destiny comes
to those who listen,

and fate sorts out
the rest.

Yeah.

I'm so proud of you.

Proud of me?

And of us.

Don't do this right now.


I'm really proud
of us too.

I'm proud of you.

All right.
Thank you for coming.

New York City

Okay, I'll shut up.

What is so obscene
about a woman's body?

If religious leaders...

Religious leaders believe
that God created man and woman,

and they are so offended
by our bodies!

Don't arrest us
for public nudity.

Complain
to the manufacturer!

Get on your knees
and pray for God

to make a less obscene
version of us!

Whoo!
