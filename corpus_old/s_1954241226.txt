Once upon a time.
In the far, far north.

The Snow Queen appeared
and changed life on Earth

as we know it.

The World became such a cold place,

that people would
hide inside their houses.

But there were those who
would stand up to the Queen.

They were called Wizards.

Then one night, the evil Queen
sent a north wind rushing into town,

to freeze the last Wizard left on earth.

Master Vegard.

Gidee up!
Go!

Master Vegard made magic mirrors

that were capable of
reflecting one's true self,

which no mask could disguise.

These mirrors were the
Snow Queen's biggest fear.

Una.  Quickly.
Hide the children.

Una, hurry.

Gerda, hide.

Do not be afraid, my love.

We shall live forever
in our children's hearts.

I love you.
I love you, too.

THE SNOW QUEEN

Master Vegard,
we meet again.

I am so pleased to see you.

And thrill you.

And look at your wife.

A bit stiff, don't you think?

Oh, enough with all the fun.

The time for eternal frost has come.

Mirror...

The Earth is growing cold.

Your power is getting
stronger, your Majesty.

People's hearts are waning,

and yet ....

I'm listening ...

A child lives among the people.

The Master's blood
runs through its veins.

Its young heart beats vigorously.

A living heir to Master Vegard
could stop the forces of the North.

Good morning, Mrs Van Berry.

Kai . Ohh.
Hello my boy.

Come in.

Get warm.
Make yourself at home.

It must be freezing outside.

As usual of course.

Here he is.  As promised.
Look!

I see you shaved a few pounds off
my face and not just a couple of years.

Truth be told.  I've never been
slender, not even in my youth.

You don't you like it?
Don't be silly, boy.

I absolutely love it, my dear.
You know what?

I have got a little surprise
of my own, for you too.

It must be around here.

Is this real paint?
And brushes?

Take it.

A truly passionate artist like you

must have all the
right tools to work with.

My husband wanted to be an artist,
but he became a pirate instead.

It's a pity his ship sank before
he even learned how to draw.

But be careful my boy.

The last thing I would
ever want to happen,

is for you to get in trouble.

Thank you, Mrs Van Berry.
Goodbye, dear.

Sorry.

Troll.

Listen very carefully, Troll.

Go search among the people.

I want you to find
Master Vegard's heir.

Do you understand?

Did I say you could leave?

One more nod ...

and the castle will have a long
nose ice statue in its collection.

Now, listen carefully.

Take this vial of
North Wind with you, Troll.

It will shine brightly
near the Master's heir.

So pay very close attention.

You must wait for the North Star.

Then break the vial.

And the North Wind will
bring you back to the castle.

Thank you.
Thank you, your Majesty.

I'm on it.  Piece of cake.
Be back tomorrow. Take it.

St. Peters Kids Shelter.

March!  All children to
the workshop at once.

Everybody and you orphans.
No exceptions.

Luta! Luta, where are you?

Naughty weasel.

Did you leave your room again?

If the house master finds out,
he'll make a scorns out of you.

Obedience and hard work
are expected at all times.

There is no mummies or daddies
holding your hand around here.

This is an orphanage.

And you're expected to be so
sufficient and follow simple rules.

You never speak
unless you're spoken to.

And there is absolutely
no laughter allowed.

Laughter is a detriment
to our work discipline.

This is the third time you're
late this week, young lady.

I'm sorry, sir.  It won't
happen again, I promise.

Now, it is also prohibited
to engage in to activities

such as drawing, painting, singing,

or any other useless
artistic expression of that sort.

And last but not least...

No pets.

Mr House Master?

May I be excused sir?
For just a minute.

I promise that's all it will take.

One minute.

Hi, sorry.
Don't mean to bother you.

But I think my weasel
might be in your basket.

Is it a white, cute thing
with really nice fluffy fur?

Yeah.  But she loves
to wander around.

She's crazy about chimneys.

She's always getting into trouble.
Little brat.

Actually, she's right behind you.

Oh, Luta.

She's such a little pet.

I'm Gerda. Hmm.
Don't think I've seen you here before.

Are you new?

Piece of cake.

I'll be back tomorrow with the kid.

I work here in the .....
What?

I found him.
It took me 13 years, but I did it.

What's this?  Is it paint?
Are you a painter?

Can I see?

No!   I'm busy.
Some other time.

Okay?

I would say that's a
pretty long minute, isn't it?

If you think you can
wander around the house

when you're supposed to be working.

Boy, do I  have
some bad news for you.

Mr House Master, sir?

I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

I asked her to help me,
clean the boiler.

Huh, unable to handle our
own chores now, are we?

You can go, but don't think
you're free from punishment.

And you are not to leave the workshop
until you assume 50 more mittens.

Do you understand me?

But ...
100!

As for you .....

Every single boy and girl in
our house, without exception

is gainfully employed.

But instead of looking after
the boilers, what do you do?

You paint?

But paintings bring joy
and warmth to this cold world.

Stop!

Nonsense.
But on the other hand ...

No!

You were right, Kai.
They do bring warmth to the world.

And they are most
pleasing to the eye as well.

That was absolutely
barbaric, in my opinion.

Who's there?

Over here.
Little lower.

Yah.  Hi.

Unbelievable!
A talking weasel.

My friend, you're surely not going
to remain a stoker all your life.

A gifted boy like you.

Gifted?
You mean me?

Yeah, you.

I know a thing or two about art.

And this my lad, I have
to say, is excellent work.

Oh, right.
No masterpiece, but ...

Not bad for a boy
from a place like this.

So where did you get the gift from?
Must be in your genes.

So, who's your parents?
They died.

A long time ago.
I was a baby.

That's right.  A baby.
You know what?

I think what you have to do is grow.

Develop as an artist, that is.

But not here, in this dump, of course.

I can arrange
a place for you to go to.

Where there are people just like you.

Where you'll become a master.

All you got to do is tell me you're
ready, boy and we can leave tonight.

Once the North Star comes out.
What do you say?

I...

I need to think about it.

No, no, no ...
I'm not rushing you.

Please, take your time.
But not too long.

North Star. Tonight.
Got it?

He is really nice.
Don't you think?

You know, when
I think of my brother ...

I imagined that he'd be like him.

Did you see?
He tried to protect me.

I should probably thank him.

It is the right thing to do.
He's so nice.

Finally, 100!

Lights out everyone!

Time for bed.

Quiet!

Alright kid. You're all packed?

Well, actually I don't have much.

This is the only thing I'm taking.

Yeah. Sure ...
Whatever.

Hold on a second.  I just
gonna check something out here.

What's going on?

Wait!
Are you an only child?

I heard I had a sister.

But...
I don't remember her name.

I don't really remember her at all.

Unbelievable.

You mean now I got to start looking
for Master Vegard's daughter?

Did you know my father?

Master Vegard?

Yeah, of course.
But I mean, not personally.

But, let's just say ...

We had a mutual acquaintance.

How about we just agree to say, you know,
your sister died along with parents, ok?

No, I'm alive.

Gerda?

Kai?

Hey.

A troll?

Oh no you don't.

I almost froze to
death looking for you.

Let her go!

What do you mean?
She's the one holding on to me!

Let go of me, girl!

I can't let go!
We're too far from the ground.

Hold on, Gerda.
Don't let go.

I won't.
I'm not going to lose you again.

Too late.  I'm the one who
found him first.  He's mine.

What?   What the heck are
you doing, you white rabbit?

Just get out of my delicate nose!

Kai!

Gerda!

Kai!

Well, that's it!
Get ready to meet an angry troll!

You'd better tell me
where you sent Kai.

Unless you want my Luta
on that ugly face of yours.

Aw, what are you doing?
You hit me right in the face.

Luta!  Get him!

You've ruined everything.

Hey!  Where did you get that thing?

Are you talking about this?

A mirror.

That's Master Vegard's magic mirror.

Yeah.
That thing in your hand.

Where the you get it?

It's always been with me.
For as long as I can remember.

So she's Master Vegard's kid too?

Oh boy, I'm in trouble.

Okay.
Where you send Kai?

And if you don't tell me,
I'll smash you with this.

It wasn't me.
It's the North Wind.

And it's taken him
to the Snow Queen.

What does she want with him?

He's an artist.
You're kidding, right?

You should know by now
the Queen hates all artists.

Sculptors, musicians ...
Now, listen carefully.

You're going to
help me get Kai back.

Or else what?
Luta.

Get off.
Get it off me.

Help! Help!

I will ... just get it off!

I will take you to Kai.

I said I'll help.

I'm Gerda.
And this is Luta.

Orm.

Time to move.

Time to move?

And how exactly are we
supposed to climb down there?

Orm.
You don't want to make us angry.

I'll move when I feel like it.

I thought I was going to fall ...

Orm, watch out!

Orm.

You know, you should thank me
because I just saved your life.

So shut up.

Wow. It's so beautiful.
So many flowers.

I'm going to go into the house
and snatch me something to eat.

You are coming with me.

And you, keep an eye out.

We're not going to steal.

What we going to do is
politely ask for some food.

Look at all these flowers.

I'm sure they're nice people.

I bet you, they're generous too.

Oh Gerda.

You really don't know
much about people, do you?

Who's there?

Alright. Let's get the
old woman a heart attack.

I'll go see what I can find.

Aahh my roses.

This bush could have been
remade about ... 3 bouquets.

But there are only five flowers.

Who are you, nincompoop?

Ahh.
Just a case of 2 and 1 of 1.

Now, let's see. That adds up
to 35 dollars, plus the gate.

No.

And the window.

Ahh, I'll give you 2
dollars for that furry ...

Her name is Luta.

Err ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you,

but I was wondering,
do you have any food?

What is that?  How peculiar.
What's that smell?

That's the scent of roses.

I'd better be going.

Well, well.
This is interesting.

This could fetch 10 dollars each.

Hold it right there.

Truth is, I can't bear
to see you go hungry

in this freezing weather, my dear.
Come in.

I'll give you some
hot tea and biscuits.

But I must go
see the Snow Queen.

Believe me, girl.
You don't want to see her.

No need to bow
so low for me ... Kai.

Who would have thought a troll
could make it happen after all?

No doubt, just fool's luck.

How were your travels
coming here, my dear?

You seem to have made it alright.

Most arrive as a block of ice.

You have a strong heart, Kai.

Good.  Follow me.

My sweet girl, just tell
me, how did you do it?

Is it a spell?
Or some kind of potion?

Or is it magic?
I'm sorry, ma'am.

But I don't understand.

Well look at that.
Pretty clever for a young girl.

Okay, fair enough. Fine.
Let's make a deal.

What wager shall we start with?

How about two dollars?
No, no, no.  Four dollars.

That would be a fair price.

Excuse me, but...
I do not know your name.

Sweet child, you can call
me grandma or auntie.

Or I can be your mother.

I've never really want it.

We should be sisters.
Or better yet, best friends.

You're kind of scaring me.

Me? Tell me how you did it.
I've been trying for ten days,

but I've never been able to
make them sell as anything.

Well, except for the new one,
of course.  I use it as fertilizer.

I don't know.
They just smell.

Come now, sweet sister.

Just imagine the kind of
money we can make together

if we were to combine our efforts.

You mean, that's what you do?
You sell flowers?

Joy, my dear.

I sell joy.

At a bargain price, of course.

A bargain?
Five dollars for a flower ...

that doesn't even smell?

It's just business, you nini.
Don't worry about it.

I shall teach you everything.

I'm sorry, but I have to go.

You can't go!

I mean, I just can't let you go

without making sure you have
another cup of my delicious tea.

Well, I know you'll enjoy it.

Okay. Just one cup then.

Yes, yes. Just one, that's all.

Stop right there, you little rat!

Sneaking on trying to get
my food for yourself, huh?

Well, I ought to teach
you a lesson for that.

What?

Oh yeah?

Really? That's bad.

Come on.  Follow me.

Yes, yes. Just one.

Is she really that stupid?

I'll have her in my greenhouse
keeping me company forever.

My little sister will
keep me whirling in money.

A potion for forgetting.
Very clever.

She sure is a nasty old witch.

Oh, hold on a second.

A troll!

Yeah, hi.
Come on, Gerda.  Time to go.

Orm?
 Yeah, sorry. The potion.

Speaking of, this lovely lady here was
going to give you a forgetting potion.

What are you saying?

Such lies.  How dare you?

Is that true?
You wanted to poison me?

Let's go, Luta.

You are not going
anywhere, unless I say so.

Ivy!

You better let the girl go.

What's wrong with you?
They're getting away.

Capture that girl at once!

Get her!

Sweetheart, you don't!

What?

Come to the mirror, Kai.

What's happening?
I'm so cold.

There are two heirs.
We need them both.

What do you mean
two heirs?

What's the meaning of this?

Do you have a brother or a sister?

You had better tell me the truth.

No, it's just me.
I have no siblings.

Really?   Is the little
boy trying to play hero?

No, no... I'm not.
I promise.

I will ask you again.

Are there any other children
in your family besides you?

No. No.

You had your chance.

You choose to lie.

You cannot lie to me.
Not with the frost taking over.

As it invades every inch of you,
I can hear the voice from your heart.

And it will tell me her name.

Is that her?
Is that your sister?

Gerda.

So your sister's name is Gerda?

Look at all these flowers.
They must be really nice people.

I'd bet they're generous too.

Alright. Okay I was wrong.
Sorry.

And yes, thank you for
helping me there at the gate, too.

I appreciate it.

Yeah, not a big thing.

And by the way, I am much
more dangerous than I appear to be.

Sometimes I turn into this ...

gigantic, scary polar bear.

I can't help it.
It just happens.

How many times has that happened?

What?
You mean, full transformation?

Have this.   No lunch of
course, but it's something.

But I got nothing for you.

That doesn't matter.
You can have it.

Don't want it.

Here you go, Luta.

Hey, hey.
Buzz off you little rat!

I don't know what you're thinking ...

But I'm warning you.
I'm unpredictable.

You said you were hungry,
so I got us some ginger bread.

Where to now?

Trust me. I know these roads

like the back of my hand.
Piece of cake.

Orm, are you lost?
Just admit it.

Mean what. Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

The entrance to Amanas Cave
is somewhere around here.

We're walking around in circles.
See, they're our footprints.

Please.
There are people everywhere.

I don't see any one.

My bad, huh?
You want to be left behind?

Orm, are you okay?

Are you hurt?
Let me have a look.

I'm fine.
Leave me alone.

Here they are!
The beautiful Amanas Caves.

The birth place of the Trolls.

Did Trolls live here?

They're long gone.

These caves have been empty
ever since the Snow Queen

spread her cold ambition
and ruled the world.

Her existence alone

influenced two great kings
from the Troll brotherhood

making them turn against each other.

Their desire for power was so
great that it consumed their hearts

and led to a merciless war
like never seen before.

Leaving no winners to speak of.

It is said that the
Trolls' suffering souls are

still in the deep waters of Lake Gao.

Did they all disappear?

No.  One survived.

He was ... stronger.

He was braver.
He was quicker.

He was smarter.  And also...

Very handsome!

But wait a minute.
Where is that mighty Troll?

Orm!
Are you okay?

Yeah.  Never mind.
Keep going.  I'll catch up.

Orm, are you sure?
Yeah. I'll be fine.

Just ... don't look into the lake.

That girl playing her
sweet little tricks on me.

She thinks she can be
more clever than me.

Thinking ... she'll find my soft spot.

Well, I have to admit. That
gingerbread was kind a nice.

Nothing has ever
tasted sweeter in my life.

Okay.  She shared a gingerbread,
and I've got to take her to her friend.

Huh, who am I kidding?
I'm leaning to the Snow Queen.

If it wasn't for that nasty
ice queen, life would be easier.

Troll!

Hello my queen.
I love this surprise visits.

Where is Gerda, Troll?

Oh, she'd be around.
Got to keep it down though.

Not that I'm afraid of her, but you
know how children are these days.

They think they're invincible.

But can they really beat a troll?
Come on.

You were beaten by a girl?
But there were two of 'em.

And they surprised ...
Shut your mouth and listen.

I've been too kind to you.

Why haven't I frozen you yet?

Well, because you're such a nice lady.

And deep down, you're really ...
Enough!

Yes, your Majesty.

Your stupidity continues to amaze me.

But as usual, every time
I asked you to do something,

you proved to be
completely incompetent.

Thank you, my queen.

I need them both.

Do you understand
what I am telling you?

Or else, I'll ...

Stop!

What are you thinking? Huh.
What part of ...

"You can't look into the lake"
don't you understand?

Listen to me.
We got to cross the bridge.

Now don't look down cos
no ones gonna see you.

Don't look into the lake.

Do not ...

No! No!
Don't do it!

Gerda.

Gerda.

Luta. You better help her.

Kill...

Kill .....

I've got you, ok.

No one has ever
been able to look away.

Gerda, you overcame
the evil power of Gao.

It's okay.
Nothing but an icicle.

And another.
And another.

Hurry. Move it!

What was that?

It looks like a royal hunt.

You over there.  Where is
that ferret? Answer the king.

Stop shooting at them!

You dare shout advice to the king?
My sword!

Attack!

Let's try that again.

The unforgiving cold weather
broke Queen Anne's health,

and she soon passed away.

The King was left on his
own with his two children,

and there has been no
peace in the castle ever since.

The Royal Court declared the king
unfit to perform his parental duties.

Thus, he cannot come
within ten paces of his children.

And the kingdom has been divided in
half between his Majesty and his heir.

So how are you feeling?

I got you!

Ooh, what's going on?

Oh damn it!

Visitors?
No. They are my prisoners.

Your prisoners?
We saved you.

Why are you so mean?

Because I'm an tyrant and a despot!

You can say that again.

Time for a trial and execution.

No, I'll just go
straight to the execution.

I'll chop the heads off,
and then hang them.

One moment, Sire.

Allow me to remind you that
by orders of the Royal Court

half of what the King owns must
be handed over to his children.

You take my side as the girl.

That's more than fair.

I don't think so.

We'll divide the girl in half as well.

Do you want the
top half or the bottom half?

Wait.  Hold on one moment.

Oh dear.
What on earth am I thinking.

What is the matter with me?
Have I completely lost my mind?

What we need to do, is divide
her vertically not horizontally.

That way, each of us
gets an equal half of the girl.

And everyone's happy.

You're trying to take
advantage of us again.

He doesn't care about us.

How can you say
I don't care about you?

How about last summer
when you forgot our birthday?

That's not true.
I remembered.

Too late.
How could I tell?

It's always winter these days.

I don't understand
why you argue so much.

You're family.

A family that fell apart long ago.

These two only think about themselves.

Have you any idea

how hard it is to run a kingdom.
No, I don't.

Neither do they.  They
even divided this one in half.

I don't think I can help you.
I have to save my brother.

He's in danger and he's
the only family I've got.

You see.
She wants to save her brother,

but you two, just want to
get rid of your own father.

That's not true.

I do not need you two.
And I'm going to prove it.

I'm going to set fire
to my half of the castle.

No, don't burn us first.

Oh Daddy!

Help us.
Fire.

Daddy please!
Help us.

Coming.
Your daddy will save the you!

You two are the most important
things I have ever had in my life.

You always make me work so hard.

I only did that so you could grow
up to be a wise and noble king.

Like your father.

Don't be afraid, my dear children.

Quit the babbling and grab the rope.

Gerda, there are no words that
could truly express our gratitude.

You had done so much for this family.

Please accept this sleigh as
a token of our appreciation.

What about you?

Now that we're together
as a family once again,

we don't need
anything else to be happy.

Bye!

Good luck!

I'm going now. You have a
long journey ahead of you.

And be sure to come back and see us.

We'll be waiting for you.
Good-bye!

Tell me Orm.  Why do you
serve the Snow Queen?

Well, I guess, I didn't
have much of a choice.

At the beginning,
I was her assistant.

At least, that's what I thought.

Then it started looking
more like I was her servant.

In the end, I just
ended up being her slave.

That's not right.
She doesn't own you.

Yeah well, I don't
disagree with you there.

But I have a feeling
she thinks differently.

Stop!

Hello, there ma'am.
Where are you going?

Sorry, sweetie.
End of the road.

Go.  Come on.

Yeah.
Come on.

Go! Go! Go!

Orm, now would be a really
good time to turn into a bear.

To the right!

Give it to me!

Scram. Give it!

Come to rescue.

No.

That's it. I've had it with you,
you little white rat!

Orm!

And you keep out of it,
cause this is your fault.

Wanted to see a bear, huh?

A teach your rat some manners!

Alright.
No, I'll take that.

Keep away from the girl.

Sweetie, come on.

You're undermining my
authority with the crew.

Authority?
Wake up, mom.

One day, I'll fight the
captain and take over.

Uh!  How dare you talk to me like.
You're threatening your own mother?

You raised me with pirates.

Did you expect a delicate flower?

Come on, who's first?

Good girl.

So, tell me your name.
What's your name?

Gerda.  I'm searching for...

Gerda?  I like it.
I'm gonna take that name.

So what's your name again?
Gerda.

Hey, you.  Are you
trying to be clever with me?

I'm Gerda.

North Wind, have mercy on us.

Sweetie.  Why don't you just tell
Gerda here, your name's Martha?

What brings you to
a place like this anyway.

I have to go to the Snow Queen
to rescue Kai, my brother.

If she's got him, then
you can forget about him.

But how can I just forget about him?

I'll be your sister.
Okay?

No.
I'm sorry.

You're not very brave, are you?

I'm brave.  I am.

I just cannot waste anymore time.

I hate to break it to you.
You're not going anywhere.

You're my prisoner.

No!  You don't understand.

You're the one who needs rescuing.

Now that you've been
captured by cold hearted pirates.

Pirates?
Here?

You mean to tell me that this old bucket
was once a pristine good looking ship?

Whatever.

We're going to get tons
of gold, build a new ship

and start pirating again.

But even if you do build a ship,

how are you going to set it afloat?

Where will you go?
There's no sea anywhere.

Since it froze over years ago
because of the Snow Queen.

Now!
Who are you and the dog?

Hey!
Lady, I'm not a dog.

String up the scoundrel!

Stop please!
Please don't hurt him

He's helping me find Kai.

If you let us both go, he'll
help me defeat the Queen.

And you'll have seas
and oceans once again.

Boy, are you naive.

Defeating a queen and
trusting a talking dog?

That's discrimination.
I'm a good guy.

Just ask Gerda.

Mom.
Why don't you give him a chance?

As you wish.

I have a hard time believing
the Snow Queen can be defeated.

But this is a good opportunity.

Do you think I need these soreless
doubloons, and pieces of eight?

All nonsense.

All that the sailor's
heart and soul desires

everyday of his life
is oceans to see.

The wind that fills the sails

and takes the ship to ride
the waves to unknown worlds.

I'm going to give you my reindeer.

Sunshine, remember
how hard it was to steal it?

That's not smart.   It's the best
reindeer in the entire North region.

You're going to need your
strength to take on the Snow Queen.

Well, from what I can see, you
do seem to have some real talent.

And now, the time has come for
you to get a little taste of my art, Kai.

Hold on tight!

Not that tight.

Remember!
The Lapp woman is a shaman.

No doubt, she'll know how to
deal with the Snow Queen.

Go faster, Ragnar!
Faster than the wind.

Hey! Wait for me!

I can't stop him, Brad.
Take him Brad!

My home is no place for a troll.

An old witch.  I didn't
want to go near her anyway.

Good evening.

I sense a mirror.

Mirrors are quite
a rarity these days.

When you look into a mirror

you believe you're seeing
a perfect image of yourself.

The moment you adjust
the angle even slightly,

perspective will change.

That mirror reveals
what your eyes cannot see.

Hate and fear become exposed.

Or perhaps kindness and warmth.

An master only creates  a
mirror with great sincerity.

That threatening is bad for
someone with a vengeful heart.

That's why the Queen fears
Master Vegard's mirrors.

Many years ago,
a girl was born

into the family of
a wise Lapp wizard.

Even as a young child

she displayed more powers
than any wizards of the North.

Her name was Irma,
and her peers admired her

for her extraordinary gifts.

But those who could not
understand what she was

discriminated against her.

Irma couldn't fit into the real world.

Children were cruel and mean
because she was different.

Just a witch ...
... crazy witch.

Her gift turned into a curse.

Everyone shunned Irma.
This made her deeply sad.

And her sadness turned to
anger, festering in her heart.

Then one day, Irma decided
to go into the Amanas caves

and made a wish.

Let all those who
dislike me turn into ice.

Hatred weakened her heart.

And the cold took
hold of Irma's soul

forever.

What's all this about?
I just want to save my brother.

Evil cannot be
destroyed with greater evil.

Believing that you are not alone in
this world, can help you conquer fear.

And sometimes, your
most powerful weapon ...

is a mere embrace.

But how am I supposed to do that?

The mirror.  You must
seek the answer there.

Listen carefully, Gerda.

Take this boat
and let the cold wind ...

take you to the Snow Queen.

My legend is always
bigger than the truth,

because it also reveals that
such evil can be defeated ...

can be defeated.

Then do what you have to do.

And in return, you
shall get what you desire.

Each decides for themselves.

Choose which side you are on.

I know.
I know what I have to do.

And you're not going to get her.

Orm, what's happening?

I know what I have to do.

I can see it.
I can see the Queen's castle.

I've changed my mind.

What do you mean?
I have to rescue Kai.

You don't
understand, you silly girl.

You asked how the
Snow Queen can be defeated?

Well, here's my answer.
She can't!

No one.  No one will ever be able
to defeat that horrible woman.

I don't need you.
You're a coward.

Just stay here and I'll go alone.
Luta?

So, I'm a coward, huh?

You have no idea
what you're in for.

And you know what?

I'd rather be a living
coward than a dead hero.

You know Orm?  At a certain point,
I really thought you had changed.

But I guess I was wrong.

Good-bye.
Fine.   Go.

And just let you know!  It's not
my fault that we're here, it's yours.

Kai?

What's the matter?
Kai, don't you recognise me?

It's me, Gerda.
Oh please Kai, answer me.

He can't answer you, Gerda.

Come on now.  Don't cry,
Gerda.  No need for tears.

Oh no it's her!
It's the Snow Queen!

You took my brother from me.

But I'm not afraid of you.
I want him back!

So you say you're
not afraid of me, do you?

Well I think you should be afraid.

And you want to know why, Gerda?

Because the time has come for you
to join the rest of your family after all.

You're not going to win.

Really?

And who is going to stop me?

Me.
I will stop you.

You are a brave girl, Gerda.

You know...

I think we could have
perhaps been friends in another life.

But now I'm afraid,
it's not possible.

Well done, Troll.

You accomplished your mission.

And as such I shall give my word.

You may go.
Your reward awaits you.

I'm sorry.

If I may, your Majesty.

I've been your
servant for many years.

And I've done the most
horrible and sickening things

at your bidding without hesitation.

But now, I'm begging you to listen
to this one request, your Majesty.

Please, let Gerda go.

Well, this is unexpected

and very brave of you, Troll.

But also very stupid.

Get out of my sight and be gone.

I shall deal with you later.

No, I don't belong to you anymore.

Is that so?

And who has told you that?

Gerda?

So I guess the two of
you are best friends now.

Well then, perhaps it is time for you
to tell Gerda about your master plan

of bringing her to her death.

I ... was just
following her orders.

You hear that, Gerda?
This is your troll ...

He betrayed you.

He is not your friend.
He will never change.

He will never be anything
more than a cowardly Troll.

Orm.  My name Orm!

Is there a mirror
anywhere in this castle?

In the throne room!

Keep running to the throne room!

I'm not leaving you.

Run!  It will get you.
Run!

That mirror reveals
what your eyes cannot see.

It's all over, Gerda.

You are going to stay
in these halls forever.

Finally the time
for eternal frost is here.

Come on, Gerda.
Get up.

Stand up, my darling.
You can do it.

Father?
Mother?

Get up, my beautiful girl.

I let everyone down.

I have nothing left in me.

I can't go on.
I feel so alone.

You are not alone, Gerda.

As long as you remember us,
we will remain in your heart

forever.

Kai?
Gerda.

I'm going to be proud
to call you my sister.

What?  What is this?
This can't be happening.

You thought you've taken
them all away from me, rogue.

You're wrong this time.

You'll have to rip
them out of my heart.

No one can take them
away from me, do you hear me?

No one.

The Snow Queen fears looking
into Master Vegard's mirror.

If I disappear, the
good disappears with me.

Irma!

Kai, wake up.
It's over, Kai.

The Snow Queen is gone.
Please wake up, Kai.

Why you little white otter!

So this is how the real
story of the Snow Queen ends.

Kai and Gerda get their family back.

Little Irma learned that
having hatred in her heart

would only bring unhappiness.

And as for the brave
and handsome Troll, well.

He saved the
world from eternal frost.

Ahem .. Orm.

Yeah ... well.

Alright, alright, alright.

The girl Gerda helped out too.
Maybe, just a little bit.

Trolls never get any of the glory.

Whatever!
