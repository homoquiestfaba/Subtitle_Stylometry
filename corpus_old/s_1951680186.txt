Ibaptisethee, Catherine,

in the name ofthe Father,
and the Son...

-..and the Holy Ghost...

No-one who had ever seen
Catherine Morland in her infancy

would have supposed her
born to be a heroine.

Her situation in life,

the character of her
father and mother,

and her own person
and disposition,

were all equally against her.

A family of ten children,
of course,

will always be called
a fine family,

where there are heads and arms
and legs enough for the number.

But the Morlands were,
in general, very plain,

and Catherine, for many years
of her life,as plain as any.

Neither was it very wonderful

that Catherine, who had, by nature,
nothing heroic about her,

should prefer cricket and
baseball to dolls and books.

But by the age of 1 5,
appearances were mending.

Catherine Morland was
in training for a heroine.

Yes!.

Whoo!. Whoo!.

You know,our Catherine has
turned out rather well.

-Come on, Catherine,let's carry on.
-No, later. Later.

She's quite a good-looking girl.

Well, she is almost pretty today.

And she has grown
very fond of reading of late.

I wonder if it can be good for her,
my dear,to read quite so many novels?.

Why ever not?.

What could be a more innocent or harmless
pastime for a young girl than reading?.

"He was interrupted by a noise in the
passage leading to the room.

It approached. The door was unlocked. A man
entered, dragging behind him a beautiful girl,

her features bathed in tears
and suffering the utmost distress. "

Take her!. Convey her where
I shall never see her more!.

Cathy!.

What are you doing?.

Nothing.

What do you want, anyway?.

Mr and Mrs Allen are here.Mother says
you have to come straight away.

No, said Dr Malleson, no other place will do
so well for a gouty constitution like Mr Allen's.

No other place will do so well for...

Ooh!

..for squandering money.

Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

You know you love
to see me happy.

-And thinking of that...
-Catherine is young to go.

But with Mr and Mrs Allen for
protection,I see no danger in it.

She's a good girl.
I think we can trust her.

Why, Catherine,
how you've grown!

Quite the young lady,
isn't she, Mr Allen?.

Mr and Mrs Allen come with
an invitation, Catherine.

We would like you to accompany
us to Bath for a time.

For when a young lady
is to be a heroine,

something must and will happen
to throw adventure in her way.

"A tumult of emotions stirred in the
bosom of Adeline. Fear gripped her heart,

that, at any moment,
ruffians would fly upon the carriage

and return her to the ignominy
of her captive state. "

Ya!

Whoa!

My God, Mrs Allen!

Ohh!

Argh!

Aaaargh!

Whoa! Steady there!

Come on!
Not long now.

Come on!

Pulteney Street is not quite
the smartest address,

but, for myself,
I love to be at the centre of things.

So do l!

There's a little peach
that's ripe for plucking.

So many people!

I wonder who they can be,
and what their stories are.

Hardly worth knowing, I should say,
if they choose to roam the streets

when they could be sitting at home
by a good fire.

Oh! Mr Allen is so droll.

He always says the opposite of what
he means,for he loves good company.

When shall we go
into society, Mrs Allen?.

I suppose it is too
late this evening?.

Bless you, my child,we neither
of us have a stitch to wear.

I did bring my best frock,and my
pink muslin is not too bad, I think.

No, no, no!

Would you have us
laughed out of Bath?.

Resign yourself, Catherine.

Shops must be visited.
Money must be spent.

Do you think you
could bear it?.

Very easily, sir.

That's it.
My lady.

And more.

That's the last, madam.

There.

MRS ALLEN: Did you ever
see anything prettier,Mr Allen?.

Other than yourself,
do you mean, my dear?.

Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

-But Catherine...
-Ah, she looks just as she should.

Now...might we make our way,
do you think?.

I entertain high hopes of our
arriving at the rooms by midnight.

How he teases us, Catherine.

Midnight, indeed!

Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, there!

Stay.
Good evening, sir.

This way. Mind how you go now, sir.

This way, ladies.

Heidi! Good to see you!

Sedley!

Sedley! There you are!
Is there anyone here?.

Not a soul, John!
There's no-one here at all!

What could he mean?.

If I might just... Thank you.

Excuse me.

Card room, I think.

Mr Allen!
See you later, my love.

Come this way, Catherine.

Oh!

Pardon me, miss.

Excuse me.

Perhaps we should go
through to the tea room.

Mmm.

Quick - there are two places!

How uncomfortable it is
not to know anybody.

Yes, my dear,
very uncomfortable indeed.

But then, you see, one can't speak to
people unless one has been introduced.

But who will introduce us?.
I'm sure I've no idea.

I don't know. Mother
and daughter, I'd guess.

Had we not better go away?.

There are no tea things for us,
and I think we are unwelcome here.

Yes, it's most disagreeable.

I wish we had
a large acquaintance here.

I wish we had any.

Mrs Allen.

-Ooh! Have a care, sir!
-A thousand apologies, ma'am.

Catherine, do take this pin out of my
sleeve.It was not your fault,sir.

Allow me, ma'am.

Thank you kindly, sir.

Though I'm afraid it's
torn a hole already.

There. Nothing too
disastrous, ma'am.

I shall be sorry if it has,
for it's a favourite gown.

-Really, Mrs Allen, one would hardly notice.
-Though it cost but nine shillings a yard.

Nine shillings?.

-That is exactly what I should have guessed.
-Do you understand muslins, sir?.

I understand them very well.

My sister has often entrusted me
in the choice of a gown.

I bought one for her only the other day.

Five shillings a yard, and a true lndian
muslin. What do you make of that?.

Well!

And I can never get Mr Allen
to tell one of my gowns from another.

But tell me, sir, what do you think
of Miss Morland's gown?.

Miss Morland's gown...

Miss Morland's gown
is very pretty.

Though I don't think
it will wash well.

I am afraid it will fray.

How can you be so...?.

Presumptuous?. Indeed.
Without so much as an introduction.

You must allow me to make amends, Mrs Allen.

Gentlemen.

Thank you.
Very kind indeed.

One moment.

What a very...

Really, I shouldn't have allowed you
to speak to him, as a stranger.

But he had such an
understanding of muslin.

I wonder where he's gone.

Here he comes again. And he
has brought Mr King with him.

The Master of Ceremonies himself!

Mrs Allen.

Miss Morland.

Allow me to present
to you Mr Henry T:ilney,

just lately arrived in Bath.

Mrs Allen, Miss Morland.

Delighted to make
your acquaintance.

Mr King.

Now we may talk to one another.

But we've already been talking.

You mustn't allow anyone
to hear you say such things,

or we shall all be expelled
from polite society.

Let it be our secret.

And now, if your card is not
already full,Miss Morland,

might I request the pleasure
of the next dance with you?.

With me?.

Thank you.

Forgive me, I have been very remiss
in the proper attentions of a partner.

What are they?.

Oh, I ask you how long
you have been in Bath,

have you been to the theatre,
and the concert, and so on.

Wouldn't that be rather dull?.

Of course.

But we must do our duty.
Are you ready?.

Yes.

How long have you been
in Bath, madam?.

Not long at all, sir.

And were you never here before?.
Never, sir.

Indeed! And have
you been to the play?.

Not yet, sir.

Astonishing. The concert?.

No.

Amazing. Now tell me...

Are you altogether
pleased with Bath, madam?.

Yes.

I like it very well.

Excellent.

Now I must give you one smirk,
and then we can be rational again.

Do you know that gentleman?.

Not at all.

I wonder why he
keeps looking at us.

I imagine he likes what he sees.

What?.

Do you mean me?.

Why not?.

So, tell me,what will you write
in your journal tonight?.

"Friday, went to the Lower Rooms,

wore my sprigged muslin dress
with blue trimmings,

and looked very pretty,
though I say so myself."

-The next dance! Lord Byron's...
-"Danced with one man,

was stared at by another
much more handsome."

Indeed I shall say no such thing.

Then what shall you say?.

Perhaps I don't keep
a journal at all.

Come on!

A most agreeable young man.
Was he not, Catherine?.

Yes.

He was very kind,
and very amusing.

I liked him very much.

Well, Mr Allen?.

No, l...

I didn't mean anything like that.

He can't have thought of me like that,
he is much too...

He is quite grown-up.

Catherine, I feel
I should warn you

that Bath attracts all manner
of scoundrels and adventurers,

and one cannot be too careful
when making new acquaintances.

Mr T:ilney, a scoundrel?.

Mr Tilney, an adventurer?.

He understands muslin, Mr Allen.

He has a sister.

Well, upon inquiries,

I did discover that Mr Tilney is a young man
of very good family, and a clergyman to boot.

A clergyman?.

No doubt you'd prefer
him to be a brigand?.

His father's a man of
consequence, though.

General Tilney,

of Northanger Abbey.

Northanger Abbey?.

Is it haunted?.

No doubt, no doubt.

These abbeys usually are.

Whoa!

..wearing the same old things
that one wouldn't have thought of.

Mrs Allen?.

And this must be Miss Morland.

Mrs Thorpe. Your brother James
told me to look out for you.

-You know James?.
-lndeed. He is up at Oxford with my son, John.

Mrs Thorpe!
My old schoolfellow!

Yes, he went to you at Christmas.

And I may say he endeared
himself to us all.

Ah, here come my girls now.

Isabella, my eldest,
and Maria and Anne.

Isabella, this is Mrs Allen,
and Miss Catherine Morland.

James's sister.

James's sister!

How do you do, Miss Morland?.

I have so long
wished to meet you.

Your brother has spoken of you
so affectionately.

I am sure that we will be
the very best of friends.

I am so pleased you love
Mrs Radcliffe's novels, too.

I wish I were you, just beginning
to read Udolpho for the first time.

Is it really very horrid?.

You can't even imagine.

But I wouldn't tell
you for the world.

Well, perhaps one incident
to whet your appetite.

Can such things really happen?.

Well, just think of Lord Byron.

I have heard that he is very wicked.

But I don't know exactly
what he is supposed to have done.

Oh!

And I have heard that
he is here, in Bath.

Shall we go to the Pump Room
and see if we can see him?.

Perhaps your Mr Tilney
will be there, too.

He's not my Mr Tilney, lsabella.

Indeed, you mustn't say he is!

Isn't he?.

Well, there's a certain person
who will be very glad to hear that.

Who do you mean?.

Never you mind.

Oh.

I do so hate it when strangers listen
to one's private conversations.

No, his name's not there.

I think he must be gone from Bath.

And yet he never mentioned
his stay would be so short.

Perhaps it's just as well.

My brother John says
the whole family is very bad.

The eldest son as bad
as Lord Byron,John says.

Surely he's mistaken. Mr Tilney couldn't
have been kinder or more gentleman-like.

Appearances often
deceive, you know.

But he is a clergyman.

That signifies nothing these days.

Insufferable!

Come, let's walk outside.

Nice. Both girls.

Nosegays! Buttonholes!

Posies! Buttonholes!

Are they following?.

No, they are going
towards the churchyard.

Good. We are rid of them.

Now, if we turn down there,
it will bring us to Milsom Street.

But shouldn't we come upon
them again if we did that?.

Oh, never mind that.

Come, make haste.

Posies!

Oh, these odious carriages!
How I detest them!

Make way! Make way!

lsabella!
Oh, how delightful!

Mr Morland and my brother John!

James!

I didn't know you were coming to Bath.

Thorpe's idea.

When I remembered you were here, and you,
Miss Thorpe, nothing would have kept me away.

I am very happy to see you again.

And l, you.

Miss Morland.
My good friend John Thorpe.

Enchanté.

I had the pleasure
of seeing you dance the other evening.

Yes, I remember.

I hope I may have the pleasure
of dancing with you myself before too long.

We were walking towards Edgar's Buildings.
Were you?.

Damn it, we'll walk with you! Miss Morland?.

Are you fond of an open carriage?.
Oh, yes, very.

Well, would you permit me to drive you
up Lansdown Hill one day this week?.

Thank you. You are very kind.

But...would it be proper?.

Oh, damn it, this is Bath.

You know?. Everything's more
free and easy in Bath.

Penny for your thoughts,
Miss Morland?.

I was just...Have you ever
read Udolpho, Mr Thorpe?.

Udolpho?. Lord!

No, I never read novels.
I leave all that to lsabella.

-I read The Monk the other day, though.
-The Monk!

Is it as shocking
as everybody says?.

You can borrow it,
if you care to.

Hot stuff, you know.

-lsn't this altogether delightful,Catherine?.
-Yes!

What say?. Jig it again?.

Take your partners
for the next dance!

A Prodigal Fellow!

Miss Morland.

Allow me to introduce...

Eleanor.

My sister.

Your sister!

Oh...

Yes, I am very happy to
meet you, Miss Tilney.

And l, you.

Henry has told me so much about you.

You can't imagine how surprised I
was to see your brother again.

I felt so sure of his being
quite gone from Bath.

Yes, when he saw you, he was here to engage
lodgings for us. He only stayed the one night.

Oh, I see.

He, your brother, dances very well.

Yes.
And he is very amusing.

Yes, he is, when he cares to be.

Do you know that gentleman
talking to Mr Tilney?.

That's our father,

General Tilney.

He looks as if he were
displeased with us.

It is only his way.

And is your mother here with you
in Bath as well?.

Our mother is dead.

So this is your first time in Bath?.

Do you like it?.

Very much indeed.

There are some very pretty
walks round about.

Henry and I walk most mornings.

Should you care to join us one day?.

Yes.

More than anything in the world.
I love long walks.

Though I can't persuade
my friend to join me.

She thinks it a waste of time when there are
so many other things to do in town.

I can see that she might.

She says the most appalling things.

In that case, shall we say
tomorrow at 12, unless it rains?.

Yes.

Catherine. You simply must hear this.

Come, quickly!

Excuse me.

Of course.

Make haste, Miss Morland!Put on
your hat, there's no time to lose!

-We are going to Blaize Castle!
-Mr Thorpe!

-How do you do, Mrs Allen?.
My sweetest Catherine.

Isn't this delightful?.Blaize Castle,
nothing could be more romantic.

Yes, I'm sure, but I am very sorry,
I can't come with you.

I am expecting Miss Tilney and her brother
to call on me to take a country walk.

Not they! I saw them five minutes ago.Doesn't
he drive a phaeton with a pair of chestnuts?.

I don't know, indeed.

I saw him large as life, on the Lansdown Road,
with a smart-looking girl by his side.

But perhaps they mean to call later.

No, they don't.

I heard T:ilney hallooing to a man
they were going as far as Wick Rocks.

I don't understand it at all.

Miss T:ilney promised.

In this false world, people often make promises
they have little intention of keeping.

Remember, we are
your true friends.

We keep our promises.
Yes.

But what if they should
come after all?.

My dear scatter-brained sister, haven't you just
heard him say they're halfway to Wick Rocks?.

Then...

perhaps I should come with you.

Please, Miss Morland.

Goes very nice, doesn't she?.
Smooth as silk!

How do you do, sir?.

Scoundrel!

Pleasant old gentleman.

Mr Allen?. Yes, and so good natured.

And rich as Croesus, or so I hear.
I believe Mr Allen is very rich.

And no children at all?.
No, none.

-But you're quite a favourite, though, I gather?.
-Mr and Mrs Allen are very kind to me, yes.

Ever since I was a baby.
Excellent. Excellent!

Oh, Miss Tilney!

Stop! Stop now!
It's Miss Tilney and her brother!

-There'll be hell to pay if I tried to stop him now!
-Please stop, Mr Thorpe!

I'll get down! I will!
It's not possible!

Oh!

Whoa, there!

How could you deceive me so?.

Well, what if I did?. Where would you rather be?.
In a spanking gig driving to Blaize Castle

or trailing about in the dirt
with some canting prig of a parson?.

Mr T:ilney is not a canting prig!

You have made it seem
as if I had broken my promise to them.

Whoa, there.

Look here!

Miss Morland...

I might not have been completely straight
with you, but I had good reason.

You think of your brother's happiness,
and lsabella's.

They couldn't go off unchaperoned.

And I was thinking of you, too.

I'm not altogether happy
to see you with the T:ilneys.

The whole family has a terrible reputation.

Something very strange
about the mother's death.

But you can't mean...?.

We must be careful making new acquaintances.
We're not all as honest as you and l, eh?.

But Mr Tilney and his sister
have been so kind to me.

Truly sorry, Miss Morland,
if I have caused you any distress.

But you can set it
all right tomorrow.

Let's at least try and
enjoy ourselves today.

Damn it, I've been looking forward to driving you
out more than anything. What do you say?.

Very well.
Whoa!

Everything all right, Thorpe?.
Absolutely.

Walk on.

Go on!
Walk on.

-I say, sir,can you move your sheep, please?.
-Oh, go on!

Hi, hi, hi!

It's just a spot of rain,
it will clear up in no time.

We'd better go back. Your sister thinks so,too.
We're not halfway to Blaize Castle.

Very well, as you wish!

It's all one to me!

If your brother hadn't such a damned beast to
drive, we'd have been there this half hour gone.

Will you move your sheep?. I need to turn.

I'll take my bloody time!

Come on, girl!

Lord! What would the men think
if they could see us now?.

How can I ever face
the Tilneys again?.

You mustn't be cross
with John, dearest one.

Do you know, he told me he liked you
better than any girl he had ever seen.

And he thinks you're
the prettiest girl in Bath.

-I don't know why he should think that.
-No need for false modesty!

Now, how far have you got on with Udolpho?.

I've just got to the black veil.
The black veil!

I won't tell you what's behind it,
not for the world.

When you have finished it,
you will read The Monk, my brother's favourite.

Oh, yes, he spoke of it.
Is it really very horrid?.

It is the most horrid, shocking thing

in all the world.

Ambrosio the Monk begins very holy,
but is drawn into vice by Matilda.

She gives him a magic branch
so he can pass through walls...

..and into Antonia's bed chamber.

But it is too shocking. I should blush
to tell you.You must read it yourself.

"The Friar pronounced the magic words and
a thick smoke arose over the magic mirror.

At length, he beheld
Antonia 's lovely form.

She was undressing
to bathe herself

and the amorous monk
had full opportunity to observe

the voluptuous contours and
admirable symmetry of her person

as she drew off her last garment.

At this moment,
a tame linnet flew towards her,

nestled its head between her breasts
and nibbled them in wanton play.

Ambrosio could bear no more.

The blood boiled in his veins and
a raging fire rushed through his limbs.

'l must possess her,' he cried. "

No, no, Ambrosio.

I shall no longer be able
to combat my passions.

I am convinced with every moment,
that I have but one alternative...

I must enjoy you, or die!

Der Holle Rache
from The Magic Flute

Damn fine-looking woman.

But she's nothing to you, you know.

Miss Morland, Mrs Allen, Mr Allen.

Mr Tilney, you must have thought me so
rude,but they told me you had gone out.

When I saw you, I begged Mr Thorpe
to stop,but he only went faster.

If only he had slowed down,I would
have jumped out and run back to you.

Please believe me, I would ten thousand
times rather have been with you!

Are you and Miss Tilney
very angry with me?.

I must confess,
I felt a little slighted.

But my sister was quite sure
there was some misunderstanding.

Eleanor, you were right, as usual.

Miss Morland is not to blame.
She was abducted by force!

No, not exactly,
but truly I did try to make him stop.

Don't tease her. You were cast down when you
thought she preferred the company of others.

Perhaps she still does.

No, indeed!

That is...

Then may I renew our invitation?.

Shall we say the day after tomorrow
for our walk?.

Yes.

Miss Catherine Morland,a very
amiable girl, and very rich,too.

Ward of a Mr Allen, who made a fortune in trade.

And with no-one
to spend it on but her,

she'll bring a deal
of money to her marriage.

When the old man pops off, she'll be one
of the richest women in the country.

Obliged to you, sir.

Thorpe, John Thorpe.

Delighted to have been...

Yes, it was beautifully sung.

Mr Thorpe, perhaps you'd introduce me
to the young lady.

Miss Morland, this is General T:ilney.

Charming.

And did I overhear a country walk proposed?.

Yes, sir, the day after tomorrow.

Perhaps you would do us the honour
of spending the rest of the day with us,

after your walk?.

If Mr and Mrs Allen can be persuaded
to spare you?.

I'm sure they'd be happy to spare me, sir,
and I'd have great pleasure in coming.

Excellent.

I shall look forward to making
your better acquaintance, Miss Morland.

Ooh!

What do you think, Catherine?.
It's wonderful.

It reminds me of the South of France.
The Languedoc, you know?.

ELEANOR: Yes!

Have you travelled much in France?.

No.

Not at all, I've never been there.

But I've seen pictures. And it's just
as Mrs Radcliffe describes it in Udolpho.

Ah! Mrs Radcliffe.

But I suppose
you don't read novels?.

I read Udolpho straight through
in two days,

with my hair standing up
on end the whole time.

I often think
there's more life,

and truth,

and feeling in a good novel
than in a hundred dull sermons.

Do you really believe that?.

Oh, go on, don't wait for me.

Why should you think
I don't believe it?.

Because I think you
like to tease me.

And because the real world is
different from the world in stories.

Is it?.

Of course it is!

I love to read Mrs Radcliffe,

but I don't think the real world's
full of murders and abductions

and ghosts with clanking chains

and seductions and everything.

Well, not in Fullerton, anyway.

Perhaps not quite so many murders
and abductions.

But broken hearts?. Betrayals?.

Long-held grudges?.
Schemes of revenge?.

Fear?.

And hatred?. And despair?.

Are they not part of all of our lives?.
Even in Fullerton?.

I don't know.

I would like to think not.

Well, then, I hope your experience of life
is the exception that proves the rule.

Tilney!

Forgive me, T:ilney, for interrupting
your walk. I've no time to lose.

Of course. You were expected.

Ma'am.

Come, let's walk on a little.

That gentleman is a close acquaintance
of ours, a very good friend.

He is obliged to leave
the country at short notice.

He was able to make his
farewells to me last evening,

but was no doubt anxious
to say goodbye to my sister, too,
before he left.

I see.

There is no reason
why the matter should come up.

But my sister and I would be very grateful
if you did not mention to my father

that we saw that gentleman here today.

No, of course.

Thank you.

The Monk reeled from
the unholy sight.

"Receive this talisman, "
she replied.

"While you bear this, every door will
fly open and walls will melt away.

It will procure you access tomorrow night
to Antonia 's bed chamber."

Miss Morland.

Nothing to be ashamed of.

It's all God's creation.

Come.

Catherine!

Catherine!

I absolutely knew the second you
came to the house. I could tell.

And the way you spoke to my mother,
I could just...It was almost like fate.

Catherine?.

No, no, sit down.

Can you guess?.

Your brother has made me
the happiest girl on Earth!

You mean, you and James...

Are in love!

He confessed as much
to me this afternoon.

And you know my nature,I could never
trifle with a man's affections.

In short, I told him
his love was returned.

Catherine!

He's waiting downstairs.

I know I needn't ask
whether you approve, Catherine.

No, indeed!

Though I am surprised.
It has all happened so quickly.

Not so. I believe I have been in love with
your friend since the first time I set eyes on her.

And l.

The very first day he came to us last Christmas,
the very first moment!

I remember I wore this yellow gown.

My hair was up in braids.
I am come to say goodbye, Catherine.

I am going straight to Fullerton
to seek our parents' consent.

Ah, Morland, there you are.

Miss Morland,

I, too, must take my leave for the present,
just for the present.

I'm going to accompany James to Fullerton,
and then onto town to help him choose a ring.

Perhaps I might look for one for myself
while I'm there. Do you think I should?.

A famous good thing, this marrying scheme.
What do you think of it?.

I think it's a very good thing, too.

I'm so pleased to hear you say that.

Did you ever hear the old song,
"going to one wedding brings on another"?.

Perhaps you and I might try the truth of that?.

I shall think of you, when I'm in town!

Come on, James, we must
tear ourselves away!

Go.

Go, perhaps, forever.

Isabella! Whatever do you mean?.

Your mother and father,
what will they say?.

I'm sure they'll be
very happy for James.

But my fortune will be so small.
How could they consent to it?.

Your brother, who might marry anybody.

I wouldn't think the difference in
fortune would be anything to signify.

Oh! My sweetest Catherine, in your generous
heart, I'm sure it would not matter at all.

But I mustn't expect everyone to think the same.

I only wish our situations
were reversed.

If I had the command of millions,

if I were mistress of the whole world...

..your brother would still
be my only choice.

Now, Catherine,you know I'm
only here for your sake.

You know my heart is 40 miles away.

And as for dancing,
don't mention it, I beg you.

It is quite out of the question.

I dare say Charles Hodge will plague me
to death about it.

But I shall cut him very short,
I can tell you.

I wonder where he is.

-It's General Tilney.
-I do believe he's coming to talk to you.

Miss Morland.

Delightful.

You will excuse me now.

Excellent.

Miss Morland,

allow me to introduce my brother,
Captain T:ilney.

Charmed.

Don't let my brother's ill manners
offend you.That's how he is, I'm afraid.

He was ill-mannered as a baby.

I'm surprised at you being so
disrespectful to your older brother.

How could you know
what he was like as a baby?.

When he was a baby,
you were not yet born.

True enough.

My mother told me of it.

I hope you're not already engaged
for the next dance?.

No, indeed.

My rival having left Bath.
lndeed he is not...

You mustn't tease me.

So do you not know Mr Thorpe at all?.

No, not at all.

That's strange. He seems to know
a great deal about your family.

And none of it to our credit?.

Well, I have always found

that ignorance and prejudice hold no bar
to forming the strongest of opinions.

You think him ignorant and prejudiced?.

I know he doesn't always tell the truth,
but he has been very kind to me.

You think he isn't to be trusted?.

Dear Miss Morland,

has it not occurred to you
that I might not be the best person

to consult on the matter of Mr Thorpe?.

My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

the next dance will be On A Summer's Day.

Good God, Henry. You're not going
to stand up in that maul, are you?.

I certainly am.

That being so...

..do you think your friend might dance with me?.

No! I am sorry. I know for certain that she has
a very particular reason not to dance tonight.

Is that so?.

Pity.

(Music starts)

Why are you smiling?.
Look there.

I don't wonder at your surprise.

I refused him for as long as I possibly could,
but he would not take no for an answer.

He's the eldest son, you know,
the heir to Northanger Abbey.

Not that that weighs anything with me.

I am in love with the best man
in the whole world.

Did you think him handsome?.

Who?.
Captain Tilney, silly!

Oh.

Yes, very handsome.

But didn't your brother say he was very bad?.

As bad as Lord Byron?.

Oh, John will say anything
that comes into his head.

I hardly ever take any notice of him!

But then, how is one to
know what to believe?.

One thing you can be certain of - my affection.

For you and your dear,
dear brother.
