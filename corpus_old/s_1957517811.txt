What the fuck?

[rock music playing on radio]

Kipp?

Jesus Christ, Kipp.

What are you doinâ€™?

I told you to find something to eat.

Come on, letâ€™s go.

What is this?

-[register chimes] -No, put that back.

You know, you really ought to put those magazines

-somewhere kids canâ€™t see 'em. -[chiming]

Iâ€™ll take just the chips.


Thank you.

There you go, sweetheart.

Come on, letâ€™s go.

[phone rings]

[soft rock music playing]


Okay.

Come on, letâ€™s go.


Isnâ€™t this fun?

Look at this place.

Donâ€™t you feel lucky?

Come on, Kipp.

Go knock on the front door, okay?

Go on. Go knock.


Boo! [laughs]

I got you, didnâ€™t I?

Come on in.

Iâ€™m gonna go get... make you something to eat.

[dial tone]

[cabinet opens]

Here you go, Kipper.

Come on, sit over here.

Come on, sweetheart.

I made you a sandwich.

Sit right here.

Iâ€™m just gonna go take a quick look around.

Iâ€™ll be right back.

-[dog barking] -[car door closing]

Good boy.

I got â€™em.

Come on, boy.

Oh.

Who are you?

What the hell are you doing in my house?

Sorry.

We couldnâ€™t wait, and he was hungry.

I had a mind that was your truck down the road.

Yep, thatâ€™s me.

I ran out of gas.

Luckily, youâ€™re close by.

Lucky me.

I wanted you to meet my boy,

and he wanted to meet you.

Well, good, â€™cause I ain't giving you a red cent.

You still owe me from last time.

Thatâ€™s not what this is about, I swear.

Whatâ€™s your name?

Oh, youâ€™re looking at my bear.


Thatâ€™s the last damn face that bear ever made.

It happened right out there in the backyard.

The dogs started barking and carrying on,

and I looked up from the sink and there he was,

surrounded by all three of them dogs

clawing and scratching at him.

Before I could get my gun,

he had already took out poor old Daisy and Petey.

I felled him right there.

One blast to the chest. Blam!

So, you remember that.

Donâ€™t mess with my dogs.

You wanna touch it?

Well, heâ€™s a regular Chatty Cathy, ainâ€™t he?

Heâ€™s had a rough time lately.

Mm.

That cowboy of yours do that?

Why you ainâ€™t never had enough sense

to pick a good one, had ya?

Your pickerâ€™s broken.

You want some ice cream?

Okay. Sure.


Tell me your name, Iâ€™ll go fix you some.

-Kipp. -Kipp.

Well, Kipp, have a seat, and Iâ€™ll go fix it for ya.

Uh-uh. Iâ€™ll do it myself.

Might have seemed fit to call.

I just...

I donâ€™t know.

I figured itâ€™d be better if we just showed up.

I mean, if I called, youâ€™d just say no.

Oh, well, you got that right.

-[cabinet closes] -Here.


Meet me in the parlor.

Feel free to turn on the TV.

I did. All channels are black and white.

Well, I wouldnâ€™t know.

Colorblind.

Thatâ€™s very rare for a woman.

Yeah.

Well, I am a very rare woman.

Dichromasy or Monochromasy?

-Whatâ€™d you say? -Two kinds of colorblindness.

Theyâ€™re both hereditary.

-Hm. -You know?

No, I did not know.

Howâ€™d you get so smart?

How you know all that stuff?

You got it too?

Iâ€™m not sure. Couldnâ€™t know if I do.

Now why would you say a thing like that?

Well, some scientists say colorblindness could be

an evolutionary advantage.

Lots of animals are colorblind.

Especially predators.

And bears?

No, bears can see in color.

Not anymore.

[both laugh]

You like that butter pecan, huh?

Yup.

Just like your mama.

She used to come home straight through that front door,

head right to the deep freeze,

and eat her way clean through all my favorite flavors.


Youâ€™ll spoil your appetite!


We staying for supper?

Would you like to stay?

Do you want to?

Mm.

He certainly likes you.

Thatâ€™s the most heâ€™s spoken in months.

[bottle hisses]

Mm.

Well, letâ€™s see.

Last time I saw or heard from you was, what...

seven, eight years ago?

Looks like that money you stole from me

you didnâ€™t use it for what it was you said you was gonna do.

No, I didnâ€™t.


And thank the good Lord.

Heâ€™s my little man.

Heâ€™s my angel.

Sorry I took that money from ya.

I really am.

I just...

I just knew you wouldnâ€™t lend it to me for that,

and I had nowhere else to go.

How do you know what I wouldâ€™ve done?

Iâ€™m a woman.

I watch "The View."

Whereâ€™s his daddy?

His real daddy.

What was his name?

Chip? Chuck?

Chet.

Chet.

Last I heard, he was

holed up drunk and high in that same shithole

trailer we used to live in.

And the one who done all that to you?

No.

I know what youâ€™re thinkin', Tess.

Tommy is different.

He was good,

and he is good.

Heâ€™s really good when heâ€™s not drinkin'.

Yeah, I saw that big olâ€™ diamond ring on your finger.

He loves me,

and he loves Kipp.

He insisted on adopting Kipp right after we got married.

Chet didnâ€™t even put up a fight.

Then one day out of the blue, Tommy just smacks you a good one

on his way to feed the homeless.

That what happened, Murel?

Hm?

And the boy?

Does his new daddy beat him?

No.

Hell no.

Iâ€™d kill him if he ever laid a hand on him.

Whatâ€™s the police say about all this?

They donâ€™t see me as nothing but a kooky bird.


So where you gonna go?

Hell, I just wanna go somewhere

thereâ€™s a crowd I can get lost in.

Hm.


-[Kipp] The sun. -[Murel] Oh, yeah?


somewhere.

From California.


And whatâ€™s this?

A seashell from California.


Weâ€™re invading the picture.

-Weâ€™re invading the picture. -Thatâ€™s the beach.

Good.

I donâ€™t even know what a mussel is though.

When we get to California, weâ€™ll go find one.

How about we put this stuff up now?

No.

Put your ship in.

-Okay. -There you go.

Iâ€™m a little bit nervous about the earthquakes.

They say it isnâ€™t if, itâ€™s when, you know.

Oh. Well...

donâ€™t you worry, baby boy.

Weâ€™ll get us a house on roller skates,

and when the big one comes, weâ€™ll just roll all around.

[both laugh]

Sweetheart, Kipp...

has Daddy ever hit you?

No, Mama. Why?

Good.

Eskimo kiss?

So, till...


unicorns fart and eat booger pies,

till gators drive cars and dolphins take flight,

I love you, I love you

-till morning. Good night. -I love... morning. Good night.


What was that?

What the heck?

Was that your tongue?

Gross! Ew!

-Ew! -[laughs]

Yuck!

Inappropriate!

-[laughing] -You donâ€™t do that with your mom.

Itâ€™s gross, okay?

You save that for your girlfriend

when youâ€™re... 30.

Ah, ah, ah.

Good night.

And no more with that tongue. Bleck.

Good night.

I love you.

[chiming, purring]

[phone rings]

Hey.


You just up and disappeared.

You beat the hell out of me again, Tommy.

Whatâ€™d you expect?

I didnâ€™t mean it.

Can I help it if Iâ€™m passionate?

I just got carried away in the heat of the moment.

Yeah?

You say that every time.

What?

Donâ€™t be all dramatic now.

I said I didnâ€™t mean it.

Come on home, baby.

Tommy, have you ever hit Kipp?

Tommy?

Tommy, are you still there?

It was an accident, Murel.

We were boxing. I was...

showing him how to protect himself.

He didnâ€™t duck when I told him to.

Tommy.

Iâ€™m trying to teach him how to be a man, Murel.

Youâ€™re always babying him.

I knew youâ€™d overreact.

Thatâ€™s why I told him not to tell you.


You gotta tell me this stuff.

There canâ€™t be secrets between us.

I know, baby. Iâ€™m sorry.

Tell Kipp Iâ€™m sorry too.

If he comes home,

Iâ€™ll get him that puppy heâ€™s been wantin'.

A golden retriever, a lab, pit bull, whatever he wants.

I got you somethinâ€™ too, baby.

You did?

Somethinâ€™ sexy.



You listen to me.

You stay away from her and donâ€™t you ever come near her

or that boy again, do you hear me?

Do you hear me?

-Turn this damn thing off. -[beep]

Who is it?

[knocking continues]

Randall?

Sorry to wake you, Tess.

What the hell do you want so early?

Can I come in?

I guess so.

I wasnâ€™t asleep.

I was making coffee. You want some?

Yeah, coffeeâ€™d be great. Thanks.

So you know anything about a broke down Ford Extended Cab

out on Highway 81?

Good grief.

Every other car in Oklahoma is a pickup.

Is that how come you came pounding on my door

at the crack of dawn?

Well, this one here, it belongs to a man

over in Cashion.

We got a...

got an Amber Alert out on it. A child abduction.

Child abduction?

Yeah. A mama...

took her son and run off.

Her own son?

Since when is that child abduction?

It sounds more like a weekend getaway

from a no good husband to me.

[door closes]

Who is that?

Yeah, thatâ€™s my new partner, Conley.

Sheâ€™s just up from the city.

Hm. Yeah, New York City.

Well, Officer Conley, welcome to my home.


Wake up. Wake up.

Shh!


I expect youâ€™ve heard a lot about him

from Randall and anybody else in town.

He was the sheriff here for 35 years.


Hang on there.

I hadnâ€™t even gotten my bed made yet.

You got no right to go up there!

Randall, this is illegal.

Not if weâ€™re in pursuit, Tess.

Pursuit?

The plates on the truck, they belong to Murel.

Lord, if I had a dollar

for every time I had to haul that girlâ€™s butt

back here drunk or worse...

Hmph.

Thought maybe she had settled down a bit

after she had her boy.

Hell, maybe she will yet.

Conley!

Letâ€™s pack it up!

Tess, I ran the plates myself

but itâ€™s only gonna be a matter of time

till my young go-getter cohort out there runs â€™em too.

If you talk to her, you best tell her

she needs to get herself on home and turn herself in

â€™cause it's only gonna get worse if she donâ€™t.

Thanks for the coffee.

Hey, you know Iâ€™m gonna have to impound the truck

until the owner comes for it.

â™ª â™ª

[car engine starts]

[all cheer]

-A convertible! -Remember this beauty?

Oh, my God, I canâ€™t believe you still have this car!


God!

Oh, my gosh!

-Love you. -Love you.

Here, take this.

Donâ€™t look at it. Just take it.

Oh...

-Itâ€™s what was left in the jar. -Tess!

Youâ€™re gonna need it a whole lot more than me.

-Thank you, Aunt Tess. -Get out of here.

And... and stay off that damn phone

or get yourself a new one!

And let me know when you get to California.

Write me a postcard!

None of them goddamn e-mails.

And if I hear that youâ€™ve gone back

to that damn son of a bitch,

Iâ€™m gonna black your other eye myself.

You hear me?

Love you.

Hey, Kipper, you like this car?

Oh, yeah!

What color is it?

Red! No, wait! Green!

-No! -Blue!

Blue! Thatâ€™s right!




Whoo-hoo!


What the hell, Tommy?

Heâ€™s my son!

Heâ€™s both ours now, remember?

And I never called you a kidnapper.

Well, the police are.

Thatâ€™s one hell of a way to get me to reconsider

cominâ€™ back home.

This is the third time youâ€™ve taken my boy,

and this time, you stole my truck.

What the hell you expect me to do?

You should have kept this between you and me.

Come on home, baby.

We can straighten all of this out.

Iâ€™ll tell 'em you ainâ€™t no kidnapper.

I wonâ€™t make it without you two.

No, donâ€™t do that.

Donâ€™t try and make me feel sorry for you.

Itâ€™s the same shit you always pull.

I canâ€™t anymore.

Do you hear me? I canâ€™t anymore.

-Listen to me. -The hitting, the lies...

They will find you and they will arrest you

if you donâ€™t come home.

Come home now,

and Iâ€™ll make sure you donâ€™t go to jail.

Jail?

Thatâ€™s exactly what will happen if you keep going.

Tommy, you wouldnâ€™t.

Mom! Mom, look!

Wait till you see what I got us.

Check it out! Itâ€™s for the dashboard.

She wiggles her butt when you hit a bump.

-See, Mama? -Close the door, baby. Close the door.

Thatâ€™s great, baby.

See? Itâ€™s funny.

She wiggles her butt.

Mom?

I think youâ€™re going the wrong way.

I got no choice. We have to go back to your dad.

Kipp, I love you.

I donâ€™t expect you to understand.

Turn around!

Put your seatbelt on! Stop!

-Stop! -[tires screech]

Kipp, stop!

Kipp!

Kipp!

Kipp, stop before you hurt...

stop it! Stop!

Stop. Calm down.

I donâ€™t understand. What is wrong?

Kip, why did you run away?

-He, uh... -Look at me.

-He... -Sweetheart, talk to me.

What is wrong?

-He... -What?

Kipp.

Sweetie, tell me.

I canâ€™t hear you. What?

At night time...

-What? -...he comes to my room...

closes the door,

and makes me watch him...

He makes you watch what?

...until I canâ€™t keep my eyes open.

Baby, I donâ€™t understand. What are you saying?


He doesnâ€™t wear clothes mostly, but...

What?

...then he closes my door.

What did you just say?

-[sobs] -Iâ€™m sorry.

Oh, my God.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s okay. You're okay.

Itâ€™s okay, sweetheart.

Itâ€™s okay.

Baby, itâ€™s all right.

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s okay. Shh.

Youâ€™re okay.

Kipp?

Kipp!

Kipp!

Kipp!

Kipp, where are you?

Oh, Kipp!

Kipp!


Kipp!

Oh, my God.

Baby, you about scared me half to death.

Here.

Let me show you. Give me one of those.

-Weâ€™re skippin', huh? -Echo.

-Echo. -Echo.

Echo!

Echo!

[Murel laughs]

I love you, Kipp!

I love you too, Mama!

How much?

Ten thousand million percent and a million!


I love you to the moon and back, though!

Me too!

Got it all mapped out?

Yeah, I think so.

[rock music playing on radio]

All back roads?

Yeah, but I think we can still be in L.A.

in just a couple days.

â™ª Everythingâ€™s filled with the same thing â™ª


â™ª Maybe slowly drowning â™ª

â™ª I was hanging on the edge of a shot glass â™ª

Mom?

â™ª Till the night was... â™ª

Your Great-Uncle Bob was a sheriff,

and sheriffs use guns.

-And outlaws. -No.

But listen to me.

You and me are on the right side of the law.

The police are wrong this time.

I know what they said, but theyâ€™re wrong!

Theyâ€™re all wrong!

The cops, the TV, the law, everybody.

You hear me?

[rock music playing on radio]

Yeah.

Thatâ€™s her, all right.

He was such a cute boy.

Polite.

Kidnapping.

Damn.

I sure hope heâ€™s all right.

She mention anything

to you about where they might be headed?

No.

Oh. Yeah, wait.

The boy.

He said something about California.

He wanted oysters.


Listen to me.

You stay here until I come get you, okay?

-Got it. -Great.

Oh, fuck me.

I didnâ€™t come for that.

[refrigerator opens]


Damn.

You still hurtinâ€™?

Damn straight.

Can barely get into bed these days.

Damn VA doctors wonâ€™t up my meds.

My therapistâ€™s fuckin' useless.

[lighter flicks]

Rhonna around?

This look like Rhonnaâ€™s around?

You look good, Murel.

You still with that...

Prince of Plaster

-or whatever he goes by? -Duke of Drywall.

Not anymore.

Oh.

Good.

How long you had that?

Couple months.

One too many DUIs.

-Surprised. -Thanks for reminding.

Time for a change.

-Damn thing smells the alcohol in your sweat. -[groans]

Unlessinâ€™ you're clever.


Eh? Eh?

Still donâ€™t keep me from doing a mean two-step.

Eh?

-â™ª I just met you â™ª -[chuckles]

â™ª And I wanna go â™ª

â™ª Something clicking â™ª

â™ª Surely I know â™ª

â™ª I wanna call you again and again â™ª

â™ª I wanna show you off to my friends â™ª

â™ª I wanna buy you a ring â™ª

â™ª Make you sing â™ª

â™ª I wanna write you a song â™ª


-Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Ah, shit.

-God damn. -Oh, my God.

Kipp, I told you to wait in the car.

Arenâ€™t you hot in that suit?

No. Itâ€™s seersucker.

I got it from Dillardâ€™s.

The... the tie is from Sheplers.

I used to wear ties from Sheplers.

And I got every fancy pair of boots I own there.

Why donâ€™t you wear them anymore?

Well...

Itâ€™s hard to get around this...

fancy ankle bracelet of mine.

May I use the bathroom?

Yeah. Itâ€™s around the corner.

The door donâ€™t close.

Thatâ€™s all right.

What are you doing over here for anyway? Huh?

What do you want from me?

Iâ€™m in a deep heap of shit.

Me and Kipp are both in a heap of shit.

What, police after you?

Oh.


Well, you canâ€™t stay here.

Police cruise two or three times through here a day

just to check on me.

Somebody just needs to tell â€™em the truth,

tell â€™em what happened,

then theyâ€™ll see and let me go.

Nobodyâ€™s gonna believe me right now.

What the hell you talkinâ€™ about?

What Tommy did to our kid.

He messed with him.

Messed with him? What does that mean?

I knew it.

I knew that fucker was no good.

Shouldnâ€™t have never married him.

This is your own doing.

-You got yourself into this... -Fuck you!

-This has nothing to do with me. -Why did I ever think

that you might actually help?

I knew youâ€™d say somethinâ€™ like this.

Youâ€™re gonna have to deal with this yourself.

I already have enough problems of my own.

Okay?

Get out of here before the police get here.

We had our family reunion.

Now go on.

Get out of here.

Get!

Donâ€™t come back!

Shit.

Hey!

Hey!

What are you doinâ€™?

-[car engine starts] -Hey!


What?

What are you doing?

Thatâ€™s my car!

Hey!

God damn it!

My car!




Oh, man.

[knocking continues]

Itâ€™s about damn time.

I ainâ€™t done nothing wrong.

You got anybody else staying here with you, son?

No.

What can you tell me about this car out here?

Bitch stole mine.

At least she left me hers.

So, she was here, your wife Murel?

-Raped him. -Excuse me?

Asshole husband of hers raped... raped him.

Fucker raped my boy.

Try this again, son.

Look at me now.

How do you know this man hurt your son?

She told me.

You have reason to believe

that sheâ€™s telling you the truth?

Yeah.

Sheâ€™s a good girl.

One thing Murel ainâ€™t...

is a liar.


You know, I reckon we ought to call child services

over this latest issue.

Heâ€™s a crazy meth-head looking for sympathy.

You donâ€™t really believe him.

Hell, I donâ€™t know.

But it could not hurt to look into the adoptive father.

I did.

Nothing more than traffic infractions

and a DUI that got tossed.

Kiwanis Club, Little League coach, church man.

Well, Iâ€™ve known plenty of church men

with lots of secrets.

Kipp, come here.

Turn around.

Yep. Perfect.

Be still like a statue. Donâ€™t move.

I love you, my little mummy.

[man on radio] And again, today is the third day...

-Hey. -Hi.

Iâ€™ll take a room.

Okay. Just fill that out there for me.

So you... you travelinâ€™ all alone...

-Betty? -Uh-huh.

Just for the night?

Uh-huh. Thatâ€™s right.

Cash okay?

Uh, yeah.

As long as it ainâ€™t rubber.


Sorry, that was a horrible joke.

Um, I could...

I could probably get you the honeymoon suite

for the same price.

-Big round bed. -No thanks.

Jacuzzi.


-Yeah? -It was supposed to be just for the married couple,

but I could probably rustle you up one.

No thanks. That wonâ€™t be necessary.

Iâ€™ll take a regular room.

Suit yourself.

All right, itâ€™s gonna be number 205.

And Iâ€™ll... I'll see ya to your room.

Iâ€™ll be fine, thanks. 205?

-Yeah, itâ€™s... -Thank you.

-It... no, it would be my pleasure. -No, no.

Really, no. Not necessary.

I... I seriously donâ€™t mind at all.

I just painted it.

I... I know youâ€™re gonna like it.

I got you, baby.

Iâ€™m about to take you out, okay?

Here, Iâ€™ll help you with that big one.

Oh, no, that wonâ€™t be necessary.

-No, itâ€™s okay. I don't mind. -No, no. Really, itâ€™s okay.

Iâ€™ll give you a little hand here.

-Okay. -I got it. Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s okay. Yeah. There you go.

Okay. [grunts]

Dang, this is kinda heavy.


What do you got in here, a body?

Wow.

Yeah. Listen, itâ€™s heavy, but be careful!

Be careful with that!

A body. Listen, itâ€™s heavy, but Iâ€™m used to it.

No, itâ€™s cool.

It is heavy, but I... I got it.

-I got it. Here we go. -Please be careful.

Iâ€™ll be careful, Iâ€™ll be careful.

We got it.

-Oh. -Yeah, but it is kinda heavy though, yeah.

-Oh, easy. -No, itâ€™s all right. I got it, I got it.

-Okay. -I may be a little jiggly now,

but I threw shot put at Shawnee High, okay?

-Oh. -Iâ€™m stronger than I look.

-Be careful. -I was All-State three years straight.

-Okay. -Just a few more steps.

-Please be careful. -I got it. Iâ€™m being careful.

-Here we go. Here we go. -Easy. Easy.

-Okay. -[grunts]


-[breathing heavily] -[door unlocks]

Whew, that new paint smell,

itâ€™s like a punch in the face.

Just leave the door open.

Itâ€™ll air out or you'll get used to it.

-One or the other. -I got it from here. Thanks.

All right, here we go.

-[Kipp whimpers] -[Wade] Oh.

-Oh, my God! -Oh, gosh, Betty.

-I hope I didnâ€™t break nothing in there. -Itâ€™s okay. Thank you.

-I got it. -Iâ€™m really sorry.

Just go.

Itâ€™s, uh, the name's Wade.

Iâ€™ll be over there in the office till midnight

-if you need anything. -Thank you, Wayne. Good night.

Just close the door on your way out, please.

Wade. Wade,

with... with a "D."

Thank you, Wade.

Good night.

Okay.

Iâ€™m sorry.


Oh, my God, oh, my God.

Are you okay?

Baby, are you okay?

Asshole. What an idiot!

Oh, God. Get up here.

Asshole!

Yes.

Heâ€™s a real a-hole.

Although, I donâ€™t want you using that word.

Iâ€™m hungry!

Well, I saw a Dennyâ€™s down the road.

I am not getting back in that bag tonight.

Okay, fine.

Fine. I can understand that.

I saw a bar next door.

What if I just go over there

and see if they got some food too?

Okay, stay here and watch TV.

Iâ€™ll be right back.

Do not open for anybody

and donâ€™t leave the room, you got it?

Good. Lock this door.

Lock it.

Baby.


Chocolate!

-Shh! -No! Strawberry!

Goodness.

â™ª Sing along â™ª

â™ª If I could write you a song â™ª

â™ª With Jesus â™ª

-Oh, excuse me. Sorry. -â™ª Oh â™ª

Excuse me, can I get a menu?

-Sure. -And a beer.

Thanks.

[cheering and applause]

Well, thank you very much.

This next little number, the one I wrote,

Iâ€™d like to dedicate to the... the pretty lady

from Oklahoma City who just walked through the door.

â™ª Look at all the roads Iâ€™ve taken â™ª

â™ª Some of them even left me shaking â™ª

â™ª Battered and... â™ª

[television chatter]

â™ª But I made it on through â™ª

â™ª You always â™ª

-[television chatter] -[door unlocking]

â™ª Home â™ª

[cheering and applause]

Thank you.

Hey, can I buy you a beer?

No, thank you. I already got one.

Yeah, well, letâ€™s get you another one

before that one gets warm.


Honestly, thank you, but I canâ€™t.

I left my son in the room.

â™ª Beautiful heart â™ª

â™ª Beautiful soul â™ª

You know what? You can have my beer. Thanks.

Well, now, hold on a second. Where are you going?

Are you kidding me?

The second I said the word "son,"

your face turned 16 shades of white.

No offense.

It ainâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve seen a man get all pasty

at the mention of a kid.

You got a kid. Do you got a husband too?

â™ª Take it all in stride â™ª

â™ª This crazy ride weâ€™re on â™ª

Mm, a long story.

Well, your food ainâ€™t come yet.

â™ª Lose my breath â™ª

â™ª Just like the day we met â™ª

-One beer. -Just one beer.

-Fair? -Thatâ€™s fair.

Okay. Cheers.

â™ª My love for you will never change â™ª


Do you sing here all the time?

Yeah. When I ainâ€™t workinâ€™ the grill.

Well, you got a nice voice.

Well, thank you.

You like my songs?


The one I heard was great.

-Well, thank you very much. -Thank you.

-Thanks for the dedication. -Yeah.

â™ª Beautiful heart â™ª

How come you think Iâ€™m from Oklahoma City?

I donâ€™t know. You just got that... that air.

-That air? -Yeah.

What does that mean, "that air"?

-Iâ€™m full of air? -No! I donâ€™t mean it bad.

I just mean that you...

you seem so experienced.

Oh, thanks a lot. Jeez.

I ainâ€™t that old.

No, no, thatâ€™s not what I mean at all.

I just... oh, God.

Iâ€™ve got a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease, Iâ€™m sorry.

Can I try again?

Youâ€™re already two for three.

Man.

Listen, Iâ€™m not from Oklahoma City.

Iâ€™m just a small-town girl from Choctaw.

Oh.

Thank you.

Well, uh, thanks for the beer.

-Yeah. -And the music.

Uh, you staying at The Glancy?

I finish my last set at 11:00.

Can I stop by and see you?

Youâ€™re sweet, but, uh...

we got an early start in the morninâ€™.

â™ª Beautiful â™ª

Me and the kid.


Iâ€™m getting better, see?

I didnâ€™t turn all white that time.

-Nice. -Yeah.

They had chicken fried steak.

Kipp?

Kipp?

Kipp?

What are you doing under the bed?


By the way, that guy came back.

What guy?

The jerk who dropped me on my head.

Did he see you?

No. I hid under here.

Okay, good.

Oh, you know what, sweetheart?

I think he just wanted to bring us something nice.

Guess what I brought for you?

Are you hungry?


Hey.

So I brought you that honeymoon suite champagne

even though you ainâ€™t in the honeymoon suite.

Yes. Thank you so much.

-That was so sweet of you. -Yeah.

You know, I just thought that maybe... maybe you and me

-could enjoy it. -Oh, no.

Thank you.

Iâ€™m just... gonna turn in.

Come on. C... couldnâ€™t you use a little company?

A pretty gal like you...

all alone.

No, no.

Really, Iâ€™m so tired.

Iâ€™m just gonna hit the hay.

You are... alone, arenâ€™t you?

Good night, Wade.

[no discernible dialog]


-Please donâ€™t... Kipp! -Come on!

Kipp! Ow!

-Kipp! -[police radio chatter]

Let go of me! No! Kipp!

Kipp! Kipp!

No. No.

No!

Listen to me. You have to listen to me.

Not that man. You canâ€™t let him take him.

-No! Please! -[Wade] Thatâ€™s her.

Yeah, crazy lady carried her boy around in a bag!

-No! -In a bag!

He touched my son.

He molested my son. You canâ€™t let him take him.

[sirens wail]

Baby! Itâ€™s gonna be okay, baby!

Donâ€™t you do this.

Donâ€™t you fucking do this.

Stop it! No!


I told you what Iâ€™d do and told her.

Didnâ€™t I tell you?

Kipp, you all right, son?


Sheâ€™s gone. She canâ€™t hurt you no more.

Heâ€™s fine. Scared.

Tired.

Iâ€™m just glad he's safe.


Please, youâ€™ve got to help me.

Youâ€™ve got to help me! Please!

Please! Iâ€™m begging you! Please!


You canâ€™t let him go with him.

Now you donâ€™t have a mama.

What do think about that, you little shit?

Youâ€™ve got to help me!

This is not right!

-Youâ€™ve gotta listen to me. -Whoâ€™s gonna tuck you in now?

[siren wails]

[no discernible dialog]

[door buzzing]

I gotta get my boy back.


Come on. Sit down.

Hon, I canâ€™t get you out of here.

Not right now.

Theyâ€™ve got you on what they call

a 48-hour mental health hold.

What d... what do you mean?

Tommy told the court that heâ€™s afraid

youâ€™d hurt yourself, so they invoked a hold.

He canâ€™t do that!

-Yeah. -How did he do that?

Yeah, they can. Itâ€™s the law.

This is not about the law, Randall.

This is about a motherâ€™s rights to protect her kid.

This is about my right to protect my kid.


Randall, please, youâ€™ve got to get me out of here.

So, truthfully now...

how long has this been goinâ€™ on, what Tommyâ€™s doing to Kipp?

Uh...

I donâ€™t... I don't know.

But even if itâ€™s only happened

once or twice, it can never happen again.

It canâ€™t ever happen again.

Tommy could do all kinds

of terrible things to Kipp in 48 hours.

You think about that, Randall.

You think about that.

48 hours.

Two days.

Behave yourself.

You locked up the wrong person, Randall.

You locked up the wrong person!


[door closes]

You locked up the wrong person!


[overlapping chatter]

Wow, you look like you was rode hard

and put away wet.

Hey.

-[sighs] -Okay.

You posted my bail?

How?

Well, never you mind.

Just donâ€™t go jumpin' it, okay?

Whereâ€™s Kipp?


Well, I gotta see him.

Letâ€™s go see him. Can you take me there?

Heâ€™s got a restraining order against ya.

He canâ€™t do that. Heâ€™s my son.

500 feet from both of â€™em till this thing goes to trial.

No.

No! The hell with that!

Iâ€™m sorry, no law gonna keep me away from my boy.

-No! -Tess!

Not here, okay?

Letâ€™s just go to Tommy's.

If you take me over to Tommyâ€™s, weâ€™ll work it out.


[no discernible dialog]

When Randall told me,

I nearly got my shotgun and went after that

dumb son of a bitch myself!

Weâ€™re both working on getting somebody to look into it for us,

but it is like tryinâ€™ to braid live eels in a bucket.

I donâ€™t get it.

The law is more on the side

of the monsters than the children.

Iâ€™ll take care of it.

No, donâ€™t you go getting in any deeper

than you already are.

Randall and I will find somebody who can help us.

No, I said Iâ€™ll take care of it.

[thunder rumbling]


Well, look who it is.

The hell you doing here, Murel?

You know I could have you arrested.

I just want it the way it was.

I want my family back.

A little late for that, sugar.

Weâ€™ve already got lawyers and judges involved.

Donâ€™t, Tommy.

It ainâ€™t about the law. Itâ€™s about us.

Itâ€™s about our family.

Itâ€™s about you, me, and Kipp.

Iâ€™m sure we can make all that other crap go away

if you just let me back in.

Now, come on.

If you really meant what you said, we can work it out.

Baby, come on.

Iâ€™m tired.

I want my boy back.

And you.

That is crazy.

How do I know you wonâ€™t run off

with him again first chance you get?

No. Iâ€™m done runnin'. I swear.

Come on.

Just let me back in.

Please let me back in.

Iâ€™ll be good, I promise.


I was beginning to think you had

completely lost your mind.

This is where you belong, baby.

You, me, and Kipp.

Thatâ€™s all there is.


I donâ€™t know what I was thinkinâ€™.

You tell your mama what kind of dog you gonna get?

He wanted one of them froufrou dogs at first.

I told him thatâ€™s no kind of dog for a man.

But heâ€™s okay with that now.

Ainâ€™t ya, kid?

You okay with that, Mama?

Yeah. Sounds great.

Jimmy Pulley got a new litter of Dobie puppies.

Heâ€™s gonna give me one cheap...

â€™cause he still owes me for fixing his boat.

Theyâ€™s purebreed.

Usually cost two or three grand.

-Each. -That right?

I got you somethinâ€™ too, baby.

Remember I told you?

Aww.

What is it?

Open it.

I gotta get supper on the table.

Just open it.



Oh.

Itâ€™s so pretty.

I expect a private fashion show right after supper.

Damn, this is tasty, Murley.

At least your mamaâ€™s good for somethinâ€™, huh, Kipp?


Mmm.

Give him a couple of these.

What are they?

Itâ€™s just something the doctor gave me

to calm him down some.

You shouldâ€™ve seen him a couple days ago.

Out of fucking control.


Be a good boy and take these.

Drink up.

Attaboy.

[Tommy chuckles]

Donâ€™t forget to eat all the rest of your salad.

Do what your mama tells you.

What are you doing, Mama?

Just what I gotta do.

Donâ€™t you worry about nothinâ€™, baby.

Mamaâ€™s gonna take care of everything.

You just get some rest, all right?


unicorns fart and eat booger pies,

till gators drive cars and dolphins take flight,

I love you, I love you till morning. Good night.

You and me against the world, Kipper.

I love you, Mama.

I love you too, baby.

More than life itself.

You remember that always, all right?

Good night.

[television chatter]

Damn, girl.

What took you so long?

I need you, darlinâ€™.

Welcome home, baby.

Welcome home, baby.

[clattering, shattering]


Tommyâ€™s a good boy.

Tell me please.

Youâ€™re... you're a good boy.

[Tommy grunts]

Wait.

Baby, hold on.

Tommy, no... ah!


Stop.

Tommy, wait.

Tommy... Tommy, please.

Wait.

Tommy, stop.


[Murel gasping]

[Murel gasping]

Get me another drink, baby.

I need another drink.

Wake up, baby.

Wake up.

I canâ€™t see.

I know, baby. Come on. Iâ€™ll help.

Wait, let me get my suitcase.

No. Weâ€™re gonna leave it.

Come on. Letâ€™s go.

Come on.



-Crazy bitch. -[gasps]

I shouldâ€™ve known better.

Tommy, stop.

Just let us go.

Weâ€™ll never bother you again.

Well, now, you fixinâ€™ to kill me too?

Get out of here.

Get out. Kipp, go.

Go outside.

Mama will be right there.

Oh, please.

You gonna shoot me?

You ainâ€™t got the balls.

Just set it down.

Just set it down, Murel.

Youâ€™ll just make things worse on yourself.

Police would have a field day with you and that gun.

You just digginâ€™ that grave deeper and deeper.

Good girl.

Just set it down.

Weâ€™ll pretend this never happened.


You fuckinâ€™ shot me!

You crazy bitch.

You know the deep shit youâ€™re in now?

You shot me!

You crazy bitch.

And youâ€™re never gonna see your kid again.

Never.

Just keep talkinâ€™, Tommy.

Please.

Give me an excuse to put the next one through your head.

[door opens]

The bitch shot me.

Arrest her.

Arrest her!

Get out of here.

-Go on now. -You canâ€™t let her go.

Come on.

[door opens]
