-I ALWAYS IMAGINED
THERE'D BE A TIME IN MY LIFE

WHEN EVERYTHING WOULD LINE UP

AND THE UNIVERSE WOULD
REVEAL ITS PLAN TO ME.

WHAT WAS ONCE CONFUSING
AND OVERWHELMING

WOULD REASSEMBLE INTO SOMETHING
SO CLEAR AND SO BRIGHT,

THERE WAS NO WAY I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

AND I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

BUT JUST LIKE THE STARS,

THE BRIGHTEST ONES
ARE THE MOST FLEETING

AND COLLAPSE INTO THE BIGGEST,
DEEPEST BLACK HOLES.

THAT YOU ACTUALLY BLOCK IT OUT?

-UM --

I BLACK OUT ALL THE TIME, BRO.

NO SWEAT.

-BUT DON'T WORRY.
IT WASN'T TOO NOTICEABLE.

YOU ACTUALLY STARTED
TO BLEND INTO THE WALL.

-[ SIGHS ] THAT IS SO LAME.

-DON'T WORRY, YOU KNOW?

WE'VE ALL GOTTEN DUMPED.

GOOD LUCK. [ CHUCKLES ]
I MEAN --

-IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU

[ DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ]

LISTEN, LIFE IS GREAT,
LOVE IS GREAT,

AND YOU WILL FIND IT AGAIN.

IT'S GONNA FIND YOU, YOU KNOW,

BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S GONNA DEFINE YOU.

IT'S WHAT DEFINES A GENERATION.

I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LOVE,

WHEN SHE SHOWED UP, I FELT LIKE

I KNEW WHERE I WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO --

TOWARD HER.

HER FACE, HER HAIR --

IT WAS MAGIC.

SHE MADE ME FEEL...RIGHT.

-GOOD AFTERNOON.

I'M DR. LAMBERT, AND THIS IS

WHAT YOU LEARN IN MY CLASS

MAY HAVE NO DIRECT RELEVANCE

"IF ANYTHING CAN BIND

AND YOU'RE NOT A DOUCHE BAG,

SO THAT RULES OUT
THE SOX AND THE PHILS,

AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR,

YOU IN OUR HALLWAY
AFTER YOU GOT DUMPED --

-THAT WAS NOT EXACTLY
MY FINEST HOUR.

-YOU'RE A SENSITIVE GUY.

YOU AREN'T EMBARRASSED
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE,

AND YOU WOULDN'T BE SATISFIED

FROM A BAR EVERY NIGHT.

-THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

-METS FAN FOR SURE.

NOW THE FIRST STEP IS
ADMITTING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

-OKAY.
-OH, DON'T PLAY HURT.

AM I RIGHT OR NOT?

I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE
WOULD DO THAT --

-BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS
STILL THE UNDERDOG.

THEIR LAST STRIKE

IN THE '86 SERIES,
AND THEY CAME BACK.

I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY
WOULD LIKE THE YANKEES,

'CAUSE THEY'RE SO BORING!
-OH, YEAH.

ALL THAT WINNING AND SUCCESS.

-YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
THAT THE YANKEES

-IT MIGHT.
-IT WON'T.

I SHOULD GO.

-W-WHAT ABOUT -- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

-WHAT ABOUT ME?

-ARE YOU HAPPY?

IS THIS --
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

-THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

-CHARLOTTE --

-I GOT TO GO.

-WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?!
-JUST SHOW UP ON TIME!

THAT'S ALL I ASK!
-ARE YOU MY MOTHER?!

AM I IN HIGH SCHOOL?!
-I JUST ASKED!

WHEN YOU WANT ME
TO BE SOMEWHERE, I'M THERE!

-OH, FUCK!

-WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

-WHAT'S UP? [ LAUGHS ]

ONE MONTH OF CRASHING.

THAT'S WHAT'S UP,
OKAY, PARASITE?

HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR NEW JOB?

H-HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING SUCKING

AT THE WHORISH DICK
OF CAPITALISM, HUH?

-RAY --
-DO NOT TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT.

-DON'T LOOK AT HER.
-RAY!

-[ CHUCKLES ] SHUT UP!

-HEY, RAY, TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

-GET YOUR HAND OFF ME, PLEASE.

GET YOUR HAND OFF ME!
-RAY, STOP IT!

-OH, HE WANTS TO? OKAY.

-OH, MY GOSH!

-FORGET THIS.
-OW!

-SPOILED BRAT!

ASS FACE!

I'M OUT!

-MM!

-MM.

-HE'S CRAZY.

-WE'LL CALL THAT STRIKE THREE.

ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE.

WE SHOULD GET SOME ICE FOR THAT.

ARE YOU SURE?

-[ LAUGHS ]
WE SHOULD LOCK THE DOOR.

-* WELL, I'VE GOT NO FEELING

* BUT I'VE BEEN DREAMING
OF YOU *

* WHOA-OH

* AND I'VE BEEN STEAMING

* BUT I'VE BEEN LEAVING
TOO SOON *

* WHOA-OH

-OVER HERE.
-WATCH OUT. I'M GOING.

LET'S GO. LITA!

[ LAUGHTER ]
-COME ON IN. TIME FOR DINNER.

-* AND GO, GO, GO

-IF I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME,

YOU'D -- YOU'D SAY YES, RIGHT?

YOU'D HAVE TO.
-MARRY? WHY NOT?

I MEAN, WE COULD ALWAYS
GET DIVORCED,

BUT MY DAD WILL MAKE YOU

SIGN A PRENUP.
-REALLY?

HE SAID HE'D MAKE ME
A PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY

AS MY DOWRY.

-YOUR DOWRY?
-OH, YEAH --

WITH A COUPLE OF PIGS,
MILKING COWS, GOAT.

-SO I'LL STAY HOME
AND MILK THE COWS,

AND YOU'LL BE THE C.E.O.

OF AN INTERNATIONAL
SALES CORPORATION?

-IT'D TOTALLY WORK.
-IT'S A DEAL.

[ LAUGHS ]

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

-NOW, TELL IVAN HOW YOU MET.
-YEAH.

-UH, IT'S --
IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD STORY.

-IVAN MIGHT THINK
IT'S A GREAT STORY.

-[ LAUGHS ]
-YEAH.

-WELL, IN HELPING HIM
GET OVER HIS EX,

HE COULDN'T HELP
BUT FALL FOR ME.

[ LAUGHTER ]

-SMART BOY.
-YES, HE IS.

-IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

-SALES ARE GOOD.

-NO, NO, NO!

IF YOU WANT TO EAT
WITH THIS FAMILY,

NO BUSINESS AT THE TABLE.

-MM, IVAN.

-IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

DID YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD
A BOX AT YANKEE STADIUM

IN OUR FAMILY FOR 29 YEARS,
YOUNG MAN,

SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN!

-I LIKE THE YANKEES, TOO.
I LIKE THEM BOTH.

I'M -- I'M REALLY
JUST A FAN OF THE GAME, OKAY?

-HOW COULD YOU BE A METS FAN?!
-THEY'RE MY TEAM.

I'M -- I'M LOYAL.
-THEY'RE LOSERS!

HOW COULD YOU WASTE YOUR TIME
ON LOSERS?

-THEY'RE NOT LOSERS.
-LOSERS!

[ LAUGHTER ]

-MY DAUGHTER IS WITH A METS FAN.

-I AM.

-MY NEW JUNIOR VICE PRESIDENT
IS A METS FAN.

-OH, WOW.

-SALES ARE GOOD.

YOU'RE A NATURAL.
-IT'S A PROMOTION!

-THE METS FAN HAS NO IDEA
HOW TO HANDLE SUCCESS.

[ LAUGHTER ]
-STOP.

-10 TO 1 SAYS HE BLOWS IT.

-I PROPOSE A TOAST.

TO NEPOTISM.

-ZIVELI!

-CHEERS.
-CHEERS.

-[ SIGHS ]

YOU KNOW MY FIRST SHOW
AT THE LIVING ROOM?

-MM-HMM.

-WHAT DID YOU THINK?

-I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOOD.

BUT I DIDN'T HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW?

I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR HONESTY.

AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT.

-RAY SAID I WAS GREAT,

BUT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

I LIKE THAT YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT YOU REALLY THINK.

IS SOMETHING WRONG?

-I HATE THAT I'M GOOD

AT THE THINGS
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT,

AND TERRIBLE AT THE THINGS
THAT I DO.

-DO YOU MEAN WORKING FOR MY DAD?

-YEAH.

-YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK FOR HIM
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

-I KNOW. I KNOW.

-YOU WANTED A REAL JOB BECAUSE
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET HER BACK.

-YEAH,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY ANYMORE.

I-I LIKE FEELING LIKE AN ADULT.

-THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT REALLY YOU, IS IT?

-I DON'T KNOW.

YEAH, IT IS, BUT --

-YOU'RE PRETENDING,

AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO DO AROUND ME.

IF IT'S ABOUT HER, THEN --

-LISTEN TO ME.
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER, OKAY?

THINGS ARE PERFECT RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE PERFECT.

THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
-[ CHUCKLES ]

-I'M HAPPY.

-LIGHT LOSES ENERGY ESCAPING
FROM A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF LIGHT IS
PROPORTIONAL TO ITS FREQUENCY.

A SHIFT TOWARD LOWER ENERGY
REPRESENTS A SHIFT

TO LOWER FREQUENCY
AND LONGER WAVELENGTH

OR A SHIFT TOWARD THE RED
FOR VISIBLE LIGHT.

DON'T PUT YOUR PENCIL DOWN YET,
MULLEN.

[ LAUGHTER ]

SO, ANOTHER EXAMPLE HOW EVENTS
ARE PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY,

BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY,
REALLY.

TRULY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES
STEMMING FROM HARD FACTS --

THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT
BEHIND RELATIVITY.

CRYSTAL-CLEAR? EXCELLENT.

NOW, IF WE TAKE
THIS EXAMPLE FURTHER...

BRUSHING UP
ON YOUR RELATIVISTIC PHYSICS?

THAT'S A BIG LEAP FROM 101.

-[ CHUCKLES ] YOU REMEMBER ME?

I REMEMBER THE STUDENTS
WHO REALLY LISTEN.

PLUS, YOU WROTE THAT GREAT ESSAY
ON THE ABERRATION OF STARLIGHT.

-WOW. T-THANK YOU FOR NOTICING.

-OBSERVATION
IS THE BACKBONE OF ASTRONOMY.

-W-WOULD YOU HAVE
ANY ADVICE FOR SOMEONE

WHO WANTED TO MAKE A TRANSITION
INTO A CAREER IN ASTRONOMY?

-ONE WOULD NEED
A STRONG FOUNDATION

IN PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS,

OBVIOUSLY A THOROUGH
COMPREHENSION

OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM,
ATOMIC AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS,

THERMODYNAMICS,
STATISTICAL MECHANICS,

QUANTUM THEORY,
AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.

-AND FOR SOMEONE
WITH A LIBERAL-ARTS DEGREE?

-IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH
YOUR SKILLS FROM YOUR INTERESTS.

CAN I ASK WHY YOU DIDN'T
PURSUE THIS AS AN UNDERGRAD?

-CALCULUS AND PHYSICS.
[ CHUCKLES ]

-THERE ARE JOBS IN THE FIELD
THAT AREN'T SCIENCE-RELATED.

YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO IT.

-IN THE CITY?

-YOU MIGHT HAVE TO THINK
A LITTLE MORE RURAL.

[ SIREN CHIRPS ]

[ HORNS HONKING ]

-I WISH I COULD
REMEMBER IT BETTER.

-HOLD ON. WAIT, LOOK.

JUST -- OKAY. CLOSE YOUR EYES.

CLOSE YOUR EYES, OKAY?

CAN YOU SEE IT?

-YEAH.

-I LOVE YOU.

-I LOVE YOU, TOO.

-OKAY, GUYS, SO,
I THREW OUT A NUMBER.

IT WAS 15% QUARTERLY JUMP.

DO NOT THINK OF IT
IN TERMS OF 5% A MONTH.

WE HAVE NOT HAD
A 5% MONTH SINCE JANUARY 2007.

-LOOK AT THIS FUCKING GUY!

WHAT'S UP, BRO?!

THIS GUY STOLE MY GIRLFRIEND.
-I DIDN'T STEAL HIS GIRLFRIEND.

-NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

IT'S COOL IF YOU DID, YOU KNOW,

BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING SERIOUS,

YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S
JUST NOT HOW I ROLL.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

LIKE THAT -- I'D HIT THAT.

-HE MISSED.

-TWO TIMES.

SO, HOW ARE YOU, MAN?

STILL WORKING
WITH OLD MAN MARKOVIC?

THAT GUY HATED ME.

-YEAH, I'M STILL
PUSHING THE CLOCK.

-MM.

-WHAT HAPPENED TO GIRABALDI'S?

-EH, ASSHOLE. WHATEVER.

HOW'S LITA?

-SHE'S GOOD.
-YEAH?

-I THINK. I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

-YOU HIT THAT?
-WHAT? NO.

-NO, IT'S COOL IF YOU DID.
-NO, NO. IT'S NOT COOL.

-18 WANTS THEIR CHECK.

-GOT IT.

UM...YOU STILL HUNG UP ON THAT,

UH, OTHER CHICK, YOU KNOW?

-UH, YEAH.

YEAH, I GUESS SO.

-YEAH.

THAT'S NOT HEALTHY, MAN.

-I KNOW.

DO YOU -- DO YOU NOT HAVE
A PROBLEM GETTING OVER GIRLS?

-RAY, YOUR ENTIRE SECTION'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

-I GOT IT.

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GIRL,
YOU KNOW?

EACH ONE IS, LIKE,
LEADING UP TO THE NEXT ONE.

THEY'RE PART OF MY PATH.

I MEAN, I MAY END UP
WITH, UH, LITA.

[ CHUCKLES ]
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

SHE MADE ME BELIEVE IN LOVE
AND ALL THAT CRAP.

BUT I'M JUST NOT READY
FOR HER YET.

-RIGHT.

-ANYWAY, I GOT TO GO.

-OKAY.
-LATER.

-LATER.

HEY, FOUR MORE, PLEASE.

-COMING RIGHT UP.

-[ SIGHS ]

[ CHUCKLES ]

-* OH, COME IN

* FROM THE DARKNESS

* ON THE EDGE OF THIS
THREE-TREE TOWN *

* BECAUSE IT'S THICKER
THAN THE WOODS OUT THERE *

-OUR BARTENDER
GIVES HIM GLASSES.

BARTENDER GIVES HIM THE GLASSES.

HE JUST GOES,
"I'M NOT DRINKING THAT.

GET AWAY ME."
-VERY, VERY FUN. NO, IT WAS!

WHO -- WHO SAYS THAT
TO A BARTENDER?

THEY'RE TRYING TO BE NICE
TO YOU.

WE GOT KICKED OUT IMMEDIATELY.

-* COME IN FROM THE SHADOWS

* OF THESE BOOT-BLACK,
MARCHING CLOUDS *

* 'CAUSE TROUBLE FALLS
LIKE RAIN *

* AND LATELY IT'S BEEN
POURING DOWN *

-STAY.

RIGHT NOW CAN WE JUST...

KEEP IT LIKE THIS...

SIMPLE?

-* SO I, I'VE SEEN

* LONELINESS

* SHE TIED ME DOWN

* IN HER SWEET CARESS
-[ GROANS ]

[ SIGHS ]

HE'S A PARASITE TO HUMANITY...

A LEECH, A LECHEROUS DEVIANT...

STEALER OF GIRLFRIENDS,
BREAKER OF INNOCENT HEARTS...

A PIRATE ON THE SEAS OF
INTERNATIONALLY SELLING THINGS.

-SO IT'S YOU WHO'S BEEN
RUNNING UP MY UTILITY BILLS.

YEAH, I'M JUST TRYING TO
POLISH UP ON THE MYSAI PROPOSAL.

I THINK THE YANKEE TICKETS
CLOSE THE DEAL FOR MR. DIBATA.

-WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT MOST?

-LITA.

-IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS ME,
IMPRESS HER.

GO HOME.

-WHAT'S UP?

-I'M NERVOUS.
-[ CHUCKLES ]

WHAT ABOUT?
-THURSDAY.

I TOLD YOU A&R FROM URGE
IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP...

-RIGHT.
-...AND I'M FREAKING OUT.

PLEASE DON'T BE LATE
TO THIS ONE.

-OKAY.

-WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

-OBSERVATORIES OUT WEST,
UP NORTH.

[ CHUCKLES ]
SOMETIMES, THEY POST JOBS.

-THAT'S RAD.

-WELL, YOU NEED A DEGREE
OR RELEVANT SKILLS

FOR MOST OF THE JOBS,

BUT SOMETIMES
THEY NEED A JANITOR...

-[ LAUGHS ]
-...OR -- OR A GROUNDS KEEPER.

UH, THERE'S THIS ONE
AT 10,000 FEET

OUTSIDE THIS REMOTE,
LITTLE TOWN.

IT -- IT'S THE REAL DEAL.

-IT'D BE COOL TO LIVE OUT THERE,
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

I MEAN, IT'D BE LIKE
THE SPIRIT QUEST THE INDIANS DO.

AND WE COULD TRY PEYOTE.

-[ LAUGHS ]
-AND ARE THEY HIRING?

OR DO THEY HAVE A GIFT SHOP?
I COULD DO THAT.

-YOU'D GO WITH ME?

I MEAN, ISN'T THIS
KIND OF ONE OF THOSE

GROWING UP ON MY OWN
SORT OF THINGS?

-IT'S MORE FUN TO GROW
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

GROWING ON YOUR OWN ALWAYS SEEMS
TO INVOLVE BEING DEPRESSED.

-[ SIGHS ]

YOU ARE WISE BEYOND YOUR YEARS,
LITA MARKOVIC.

-THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.

BEDTIME.

DON'T COME TO BED TOO LATE.

-I WON'T.

-[ LAUGHS ]

-[ SIGHS ]

[ SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ]

-SORRY.

I CRASHED OUT.

-I KNOW.

WHAT IS THIS, CHARLOTTE?
WHAT -- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

-IT'S US.
IT -- IT'S COMPLICATED.

-THAT'S --

[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

-I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

-WELL, YOU ASKED ME TO.

I STILL -- I'M STILL DOING

EVERYTHING
THAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO.

SHOULDN'T THIS BE EASIER?

-SORRY.

I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

-ME, TOO.

-ARE YOU STILL GONNA COME
ON THURSDAY?

-YEAH.

YEAH, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
OF COURSE.

I GOT TO GO.

-AW, THANKS, MAN.

[ LAUGHS ] I GOT IT.

[ HORN HONKS ]

-CAN I GET THE DESSERT MENU?

-YEAH, NO, I LIKE THAT.

-* I'M SOMEWHERE

* YOU'RE SOMEWHERE

* I'M NOWHERE

* YOU'RE NOWHERE

* YOU'RE SOMEWHERE

* YOU'RE SOMEWHERE

* I COULD GO THERE

* BUT I DON'T

* YOU TELL ME
STORIES OF THE SEA *

* AND THE ONES YOU LEFT BEHIND

* AND THE ONES WE LEFT BEHIND

-[ SIGHS ]

-HOW LONG?

-IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
-HOW LONG?

I TRUSTED YOU.

-I KNOW.

-I-I BELIEVED IN YOU.

-YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

I HAVE NO EXCUSE OR DEFENSE.
-STOP, STOP, OKAY?

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

-[ SIGHS ]

-BATTING PRACTICE, RIGHT?

[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

-[ SIGHS ]

[ SIGHS ]

[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

[ BLOWS ]

[ CAR DOOR CLOSES ]

HELLO.

-WHO ARE YOU?

-UH, I'M THE NEW
MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONAL.

TODD HIRED ME.

-SO WHEN MY OBSERVATORY
IS BURNED DOWN

BY A STRAY ASH
FROM THE NEW JANITOR

WHO HAS NO SCIENTIFIC VALUE
TO THIS FACILITY WHATSOEVER,

I SHOULD BLAME TODD?

THERE'S NO SMOKING
AT THIS FACILITY.

-I-I KNOW. IT'S IN THE HANDBOOK.

THOUGHT IT'D BE
A NICE WAY TO MEET PEOPLE.

[ SIGHS ]

[ KNOCKS ]

-[ Indian accent ]
COME IN, COME IN.

WELCOME, MY FRIEND.

-SAY, UH, WHAT'S ON THE DISH
THIS EVENING?

-[ Normal voice ]
UGH, S.O.S., BROTHER.

DEGREE IN PHYSICS --
I MIGHT AS WELL BE

ANSWERING PHONES AT
A TOASTER TECH-SUPPORT HOTLINE.

-OH, IS THIS
THE RED-SHIFT STUFF?

-LYMAN ENERGY ABSORPTION
AND HIGH RED-SHIFT QUASARS

MEASURING THE UNIVERSE'S
RATE OF EXPANSION OVER TIME.

WHAT, THEY DON'T TEACH YOU GUYS
THIS STUFF IN JANITOR SCHOOL?

-NO, IT'S MORE,
UH, PHILOSOPHY --

YOU KNOW,
LIKE IF THE UNIVERSE'S EXPANSION

IS HIGHER THAN
THE RATE OF THOUGHT,

WILL TOKAGAWA FINALLY
HAVE A CHANCE TO GET LAID

BEFORE EXISTENCE
AS WE KNOW IT CEASES.

YOUR STUNNING BARB
MIGHT ACTUALLY ZING, BUDDY,

IF YOU DIDN'T DELIVER IT
WITH A BLEEDING NOSE.

WEEK IN AND STILL A NEWBIE,
I SEE.

NOT EVERYBODY'S CUT OUT
FOR LIFE AT 10,000 FEET.

-[ GROANS ]

HEY, UH, I WAS HAVING
A SMOKE TODAY,

AND SOME LADY YELLED AT ME.

-A LADY LIKE --
LIKE OLDER AND MEAN?

-SHE WASN'T THAT OLD.
SHE WAS WEARING A HAT.

-OH, YOU'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ON SABBATICAL. GO, GO, GO!

-WHO, WHO?
-HYPATIA! DUDE, OUT.

NO CIVVIES ON BRIDGE.
GO, THANK YOU, AND COME AGAIN.

[ GROANS ]

-[ SIGHS ]

[ SIGHS ]

-ARE THE RULES IN THE HANDBOOK
NOT CLEAR,

OR DO YOU JUST HAVE
NO REGARD FOR FOLLOWING THEM?

-NO, T-T-THEY'RE VERY CLEAR,
MA'AM.

-THEN WHY WERE YOU
TOUCHING MY TELESCOPE?

-I HADN'T COME UP HERE YET.

UH, TODD WAS SUPPOSED TO
BRING ME, BUT...

-I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
COMING UP HERE TO SMOKE.

-I-I DON'T REALLY SMOKE.
-GOOD THING.

YOU HOLD YOUR CIGARETTE
LIKE A MIDDLE-SCHOOL GIRL.

-T-T-THEY'RE LIKE MARTINIS,
YOU KNOW?

I LIKE THE IDEA
MORE THAN THE ACTUAL THING.

-FASCINATING.

I'VE BEEN SAYING I'M GONNA
FIX THIS THING FOR YEARS.

THE GREATS USED TO
BUILD THEIR OWN.

I SHOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE
TO FIX ONE.

-THE GREATS?
-[ BLOWS ]

GALILEO, COPERNICUS, KEPLER --
THE ONES PEOPLE REMEMBER.

-HYPATIA.

-THEY STILL CALL ME THAT?

IT'S AN IRONIC NICKNAME.

HYPATIA WAS
THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED

PHILOSOPHER AND SCIENTIST
IN ANTIQUITY.

PERHAPS IN MY YOUNGER YEARS,
IT FIT.

-WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME?

-JESSICA.

SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT HERE

SECURING YOUR PLACE
IN JANITORIAL POSTERITY.

-[ CHUCKLES ]

-SOMETHING ELSE?

TELL ME IT'S NOT A GIRL.

-WELL --

-OH, GOD.

YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS
A PLACE FOR NOBLE PURSUITS,

LIKE THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE

AND UNDERSTANDING
OF THE UNIVERSE?

-AND NOT FOR MARTINIS
AND CIGARETTES?

-[ LAUGHS ]

-HOW FAR CAN THIS THING SEE?

-I'VE OBSERVED AS DEEP
AS 3.2 BILLION YEARS,

LIKE A TIME MACHINE
PROBING INTO THE PAST.

EVERYTHING WE SEE COMING IN FROM
THE SPACE AROUND US IS THE PAST.

EVEN SUNLIGHT
IS EIGHT MINUTES OLD.

-WHAT ABOUT FIVE YEARS,
SEPTEMBER 14th?

I'D LIKE TO SEE
WHAT SOMETHING LOOKED LIKE

ON THAT DAY FIVE YEARS AGO.

-ALPHA CENTAURI'S
ABOUT FOUR AWAY,

BUT YOU DON'T NEED
A TELESCOPE TO SEE IT.

-[ CHUCKLES ]

-THERE,
THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE SKY --

4.4 LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

-SO FOUR YEARS AGO,

I-IT COULD HAVE EXPLODED
INTO A SUPERNOVA

AND WE'D ONLY
JUST NOW BE FINDING OUT?

-NOT LIKELY.

ACTUALLY,
IT'S A BINARY SYSTEM --

TWO STARS SO CLOSE TOGETHER

THAT TO THE NAKED EYE,
THEY APPEAR AS ONE.

SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

-UH, I THOUGHT I'D FIND
MY CALLING.

-AS A JANITOR?

-I-I HAD THIS FANTASY

THAT BEING HERE WOULD IGNITE
SOME PART OF MY BRAIN

THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT,
AND SUDDENLY,

WITHOUT ANY MATHEMATICAL
OR SCIENTIFIC SKILL,

UH, SOME ASTRONOMICAL SUPERHERO
WOULD EMERGE,

LIKE IT WAS ALWAYS
MEANT TO BE IF...

IF I WOULD JUST HAVE THE GUTS
TO FINALLY GIVE IT A TRY.

-[ LAUGHS ]

YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

-YEAH.
-THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

-IT CAN.

IT HAS WITH CHARLOTTE.

-CHARLOTTE?

[ SCOFFS ]

[ SIGHS ]

MINE WAS NICHOLAS.

HE WAS A GRAD STUDENT HERE
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED.

I COULD NOT CONCENTRATE
WHEN HE WAS AROUND.

IT WAS -- IT WAS LIKE
THE ENTIRE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY

OF MY BRAIN WENT KAPUT.

-WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

-OH, NOTHING.

-NOTHING?

-WELL, WHERE WAS IT GONNA LEAD?

I WAS GONNA BE THE NEXT --

-HYPATIA OF ALEXANDRIA?
-GOD WILLING.

I WAS SURE THAT'S
WHAT I WAS MEANT TO DO.

THERE WAS NO TIME
FOR DISTRACTIONS.

-HOW DID YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

-I KNEW WHERE TO LOOK.

YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES LOOKING
AS FAR AWAY AS WE CAN

IS JUST A WAY OF IGNORING
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

-[ SIGHS ]

[ CLEARS THROAT ]
[ KNOCKS AT DOOR ]

-NOW BATTING, NUMBER 44...

-COME WITH ME.

-[ SIGHS ]

UH, WHAT'S, UH --

-YOU'RE FIRED.

YEAH. HERE'S A SEVERANCE CHECK.

AND NO, SEVERANCE FOR
A MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONAL

IS NOT THE NORM.

THERE'S MORE FOR YOU THAN THIS.

BEGONE.

-* SLOW AND EXPOSED

* LIKE A SNAIL CROSSING ON

* A FOOTPATH AFTER THE RAIN

* YOU'RE ALL ALONE

* WITH SO FAR TO GO

* UNTIL YOU REACH GREEN AGAIN

* TAKE COVER, TAKE COVER

* TAKE COVER IN THE THOUGHT
THAT YOU *

* ARE NEEDED ON THE OTHER SIDE

* WELL, I'M JUST A FRIEND

* AND IT'S HARDLY ENOUGH

* BUT I'LL TRY TO CHEER YOU ON

* WELL, I KNOW
THAT I'D GIVE BACK *

* AT LEAST HALF AS MUCH

* AS WHAT YOU GIVE
IN YOUR SONGS *

* TAKE COVER, TAKE COVER

* TAKE OVER IN THE THOUGHT
THAT YOU *

* ARE NEEDED ON THE OTHER SIDE

-[ WHISTLING ]

-NOW IT'S TIME
TO ADD THE ONION.

KEEP STIRRING
AND PUT FOUR CLOVES OF GARLIC

IN THE POT.

BUT YOU REALLY WANT IT
TO BE ABLE TO SWEAT

WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN.

IF IT BECAME DISCOLORED,
YOU SHOULD STOP AND START OVER.

THIS WILL TAKE BETWEEN
15 MINUTES AND A HALF-HOUR.

THIS ISN'T A SAUCE
YOU CAN DO IN A HURRY.

YOU WANT TO DO IT
THE RIGHT WAY.

[ LAPTOP CLOSES ]
-[ SIGHS ]

[ ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ]

-* HE MAY COME,
BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE *

* OH, DOWNTOWN,
WAITING FOR THE ONE HE KNOWS *

* OH, OH

* HE'S GOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T SEE *

* OH, OH

* HAVE A DRINK,
AND THEN THEY LEAVE *

* OH, WHOA, WHOA

* HE CRASHES IN
AGAIN AND AGAIN *

* HE'S JUST SOME BOY

* HE'S ONLY SOME BOY

* MAKING HIS MOVE

* THINKS HE CAN'T LOSE

* HE'S JUST SOME BOY

* HE'S ONLY SOME BOY

* HE'S JUST SOME BOY

* HE'S ONLY SOME BOY

* SOME BOY

[ LAUGHS ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ]

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
-YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

-OKAY, YEAH, YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

-THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER
IF YOU WOULD JUST TO YELL AT ME

AND MAKE A HUGE SCENE.

I DESERVE THAT AT LEAST.

-I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DESERVE.

-I TRIED WITH US.

HEY, I-I WENT AND WORKED
AT THAT, UH, OBSERVATORY.

-DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF PLAN?

-I THINK SO.

-I KNOW. YOU NEED YOUR MAGIC.

FUCKING METS FANS, MAN.
[ LAUGHS ]

IT WOULD'VE BEEN FUN TO LIVE
WITH YOU IN THE MOUNTAINS.

HEY.

THANKS FOR THE SONG.

READY?
-OKAY, YEAH.

[ SIZZLING ]

-HEY, UH, KEEP YOUR
PINCHED FINGERS IN.

YOU KNOW, WATCH.

DICE THESE
AND BRING THEM UP TO ME,

AND DON'T BE A PINCHE PUTO.

-[ SPEAKS SPANISH ]

-[ LAUGHS ]

-OKAY, WEY.

NOW WE MAKE THE CAESAR.

DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WHISK?

THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.

THERE, YOU KEEP GOING.

AH, DON'T LET IT BREAK!

YOU NEED MORE PRACTICE, WEY.

[ LAUGHS ]

THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.

[ LAUGHS ]

GOOD JOB.

YOU'RE NOT SUCH A PUTO
FOR BEING A PUTO.

[ SPEAKS SPANISH ]

YOU NEED KNIVES.

-NOW, TOO MUCH WATER, YOU'RE
GONNA DROWN THAT CANDLE, OKAY?

AND THAT'S BAD, BUT NOT ENOUGH,
IT'S GONNA STICK TO THE BOTTOM,

IT'S GONNA GET ALL WAXY,
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND

YOUR WHOLE SETUP TIME SCRAPING,
ALL RIGHT?

I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU
WITH ONE

AND BE RIGHT BACK
TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.
-FANTASTIC.

-SALMON, MEDIUM-RARE.

I'M SURE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

[ LAUGHTER ]

HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

YEAH. SEE YOU TOMORROW.

CHARLOTTE.

LET ME JUST EXPLAIN MYSELF,
AND THEN I PROMISE I'LL LEAVE.

-IT TAKE YOU FOUR MONTHS
TO TRACK ME DOWN,

OR FOUR MONTHS
TO BUILD UP THE GUTS?

-I'M SORRY I LEFT.

IT'S JUST...

THE CORNER OFFICE WITH THE JOB.

[ SIGHS ] IT WASN'T ME.

IT W-WAS SOME SUIT-WEARING
HOTEL-SUITE GUY.

THE ONLY TIME I EVER FELT LIKE
I DIDN'T WANT YOU BACK

WAS WHEN I'D SEEN
THAT YOU'D FALLEN FOR HIM.

[ CHUCKLES ]

IT WAS ALL FOR YOU,
TO GET YOU BACK.

-THAT'S NEVER
WHAT I WANTED FROM YOU.

-YES, IT WAS.

BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.

THIS IS.

I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D WORK
AT A GALLERY, YOU KNOW?

I NEVER STOPPED BELIEVING
THAT IT'S GOT TO BE YOU.

IT'S JUST --
IT'S GOT TO BE ME, TOO.

THERE'S A CERTAIN ORDER
AND BEAUTY TO THE UNIVERSE,

THE WAY THINGS MOVE.

ORBITS AND PATTERNS
PREDETERMINED FOR EONS --

MORE, EVEN.

200 BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY

AND THE BILLIONS MORE BEYOND

STILL HOLD THEIR WONDER FOR ME.

BUT MY TRUE COURSE,
THE ONE I CHART --

IT'S SET IN MOTION.

AND I'M READY --

READY FOR WHATEVER COMES NEXT.

-* KICK THE DUST OFF YOUR BACK
AND DON'T LOOK BACK *

* GIVE ALL THE DOUBTERS YOU KNOW
A FAKE HEART ATTACK *

* 'CAUSE YOU WERE MADE

* RUN, RUN, IT'S A NEW DAY

* OH-OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH
