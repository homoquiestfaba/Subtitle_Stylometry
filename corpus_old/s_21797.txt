Sometimes...

Dr. Lecter and I would talk
when things got quiet enough...

about the science courses
I was taking, and--

Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

No, sir.

See, I don't consider
psychology a science...

and neither did Dr. Lecter.

Now, Barney, while you
were working at the asylum...

you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

Interacting?

Talking to one another.

Yes. It seemed to me that they--

I see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

but why don't we start
with what you saw...

not what you thought about
what you saw?

Cordell, don't be like that.

Barney can give us his opinion.

Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

What was it between them?

Most of the time...

Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all
to visitors.

He'd just, for instance...

open his eyes long enough
to insult some academic...

who was there to look over him.

With Starling,
he answered her questions.

She interested him.

She intrigued him.

He thought she was
charming and amusing.

Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

became friendly?

Inside a kind
of formal structure, yes.

And he was fond of her?

Thank you, Barney.

Thank you very much
for your candor.

And keep all those
wonderful items...

from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

I've enjoyed them immensely.

Mr. Verger.

I almost forgot.

I might be able
to get a cookie down.

What do you say, Cordell?

I think it would kill you.

How much?

250...

thousand.

Cordell...

cut a check for $250,000.

How can she sleep
at a time like this?

She was on a jump-out squad
all night.

She's saving her strength.

No problem, sir.

We got some guy named Bolton
from the D.C. Police.

All right, everyone,
pay attention.

Here's the layout.

Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, D.C. Police.

I see that from your badge.
How do you do?

I'm in charge here.

Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

So we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

Iet me explain why
we're all here.

I'm here
because I know Evelda Drumgo.

I've arrested her twice
on RICO warrants.

DEA and ATF,
in addition to backing me up...

are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs--

especially after his own
cocaine conviction--

and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us today.

You got a smart mouth, lady.

Officer, if you wouldn't mind...

I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

All right, take a look.

Fish market--
back's on the water.

Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

Evelda Drumgo is HIV positive.

She will spit and bite
if she's cornered, so watch it.

If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

in front of the news cameras,
Officer Bolton...

you don't want
to push her head down.

She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

We want to take her inside,
not out in the street.

We can get closest with the van.

If it looks good,
on my signal...

we hit the front,
DEA hits the back...

D.C.P.D. backing them up.

She'll have her watchers out
at least three blocks around.

They've tipped her before
in time...

so let's not make spectacles
of ourselves.

-Pretty busy today.
-I agree.

Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

-Did you see that?
-That's a roger.

What's up, man?

God damn it. It's her--

with three guys.
They're all packing.

She's carrying something.

She's got a baby.

Hey, Brigham,
it's too crowded.

There are too many people.

I say we call it off.
What do you say?

I agree.

All units, stand down.

-Whiskey Team copies.
-Burke copy.

This is Bolton. Stay on target.

I said all units stand down,
Bolton, right now.

-Too late. We're moving in.
-Bolton, it's off.

Stand down now.

She's carrying a baby.

All units stand down.

Keep that gun down, Bolton.

Dude got a piece.
Light his ass up.

It's a go. FBl!

Hold it!

Hold your fire!

Don't!

Evelda, get out of the car!

Starling, is that you?

Step away from the car!

Show me your hands, Evelda.

Please...

show me your hands.

How have you been?

Don't do this.

Do what?

It's all right. It's OK.

I know, I know.

Baby, I know. It's OK.

Friends, family, and co-workers
gathered here this morning...

at Arlington
National Cemetery...

to bury BATF agent
John Brigham...

shot and killed
in the line of duty Friday.

He was forty years old.

This ill-fated drug raid that
claimed his life and 5 others...

is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents...

beginning with Waco, Texas...

in which the Justice Department
and the FBl...

have been questioned
about their use of firepower...

rather than judgment.

This time, it was FBI Special
Agent Clarice Starling...

heading up the calamitous
strike force.

Starling attained some measure
of celebrity ten years ago...

when she was given
information...

by Dr. Hannibal
"the Cannibal" Lecter...

which led to the rescue
of Catherine Martin...

daughter of the former
U.S. senator from Tennessee.

However, when she returns
to work later this week...

she won't be so celebrated.

Attorney Telford Higgins...

representing one of the families
of those slain...

says he will file
a wrongful death suit.

Yes, sir.

Get me the Justice Department.

Agent Starling?

This is John Eldridge from DEA.

Assistant Director Noonan,
of course, you know.

Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

Bob Sneed, ATF.

Benny Holcombe,
assistant to the mayor...

and Paul Krendler.
You know Paul.

Paul's come over from Justice
unofficially as a favor to us.

Paul's come over from Justice
unofficially as a favor to us.

In other words,
he's here, and he's not here.

You've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

I have nothing to do
with the news, Mr. Krendler.

The woman had a baby
in her arms.

There are pictures.

You can see the problem,
I would think.

Not in her arms.

In a carrier across her chest.

In her arms, she had a MAC-10.

Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

It's going to be harder to do
with a combative attitude.

Can I speak freely,
Mr. Pearsall?

Your agency
called this office...

to get me assigned to help you
on this raid.

I tried to do that.

I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored...

and now a good agent and friend
is dead.

You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

Is that how you define
good judgment?

This raid was an ugly mess.

I ended up in a position where
I had a choice of dying...

or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

I chose.

I shot her.

I killed a mother
holding her child...

And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

Gentlemen, I'm going to
halt this meeting...

and get back to you
individually by phone.

Waste of time.

You have a secret admirer,
Starling.

Isn't much to look at, but he
has friends in high places.

Remember Mason Verger?

Lecter's fourth victim--

the rich one.

The only one that survived.

He has new Lecter information.
He'll only share it with you.

What do you mean,
only share it with me?

You want it, seize it.

We'd rather not.

I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Krendler.

When I speak to you,
I'll look at you.

Why would we rather not?

The last time he called...

was when we took Lecter
off the Ten Most Wanted List.

He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

He said, "Hey, this is
a senate oversight committee...

"to make your life miserable."

His family's
political contributions...

may not be enough
to buy a senator...

but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.

There's no reason to go
through that again...

if he really does have
something new.

It's a good deal for you,
Starling.

You can't pretend it isn't.

You get to go back
on a celebrated case.

I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

Everyone's going to be happy.

I'm not happy.

Well, maybe you're
incapable of being happy.

Mr. Krendler...

when you're out
on the street...

you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.

You accept it, or you get out.

You live with it.

What you don't
expect or accept...

is taking one in the back
in your boss' office...

for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

That makes you unhappy.

Of course,
you're right, Starling...

but it doesn't really
change anything.

It changes everything.
It changes me.

I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

How do you do?

If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

One's eyes adjust
to the darkness.

Six to eight
versus an estimate of sixteen.

Dylan, they're saying sales
have slowed down.

Seems like
a recurring theme here.

Perhaps corporate spending
on a slowdown.

Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

Good morning, Mr. Verger.

-Was that a Mustang I heard?
-Yes, it was.

A five liter?

Fast.

Cordell,
I think you can leave us now.

I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

I'd like to attach
this microphone...

to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.

By all means.

Here.
This should make it easier.

You know, I thank God
for what happened.

It was my salvation.

Have you accepted Jesus,
Agent Starling?

Do you have faith?

I was raised Lutheran.

That's not what I asked.

This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling...

5-1-4-3-6-9-0...

deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested.

I want to tell you
about summer camp.

-It was a wonderful childhood--
-We can get to that later.

We can get to it now.

It all comes to bear.

It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls...

who would do anything
for a candy bar.

Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses.

It's all right.

I have immunity
from the U.S. Attorney...

and I have immunity
from the Risen Jesus.

And nobody beats the Riz.

Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter...

before the court assigned you
to him for therapy?

What do you mean?

Socially?

That is what I mean.

Yes, if you don't mind
talking about it.

-Not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.

No. We met conventionally--
as doctor and patient.

How did he end up at your house?

I invited him, of course.

To my pied-à-terre.

I came to the door in my nicest
"come hither" outfit.

I was concerned
he'd be afraid of me...

but he didn't seem to be
afraid of me.

That's almost funny now.

I showed him my toys--

my noose setup,
among other things.

It's a way you sort of
hang yourself, but not really.

It feels good while you...

Well, you know.

Anyway, he said, "Mason..."

Mason, would you like a popper?

And I said, "Would l?"

And, wow...

once that kicked in,
I was flying.

He said, "Mason...

"show me how you smile...

"to gain the confidence
of a child."

When I smiled...

he said, "I see how you do it."

The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

"Try this."

Try peeling off your face.

"And feeding it to the dogs."

I can still see it.

Try again.

No, I'm afraid not.

That's entertainment

It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

Mr. Verger,
you indicated to me...

that you'd received
some new information.

Where did this come from?

Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

Where is the package it came in?

Good question.

There was nothing written on it
of interest.

Cordell, did we throw it out?

I'm afraid we did.

Oh, dear.

You think it'll help?

I hope so.

I hope it'll help you
catch him...

to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

Thank you.
I think that's all I need.

Did you find some rapport
with Dr. Lecter...

in your talks at the asylum?

I know I did
while I was peeling.

We exchanged information
in a civil way.

But always through the glass?

Isn't it funny?

What's that?

You can look at my face...

but you shied
when I said the name of God.

Finding what you want?

Are you sure this is all of it?

That's all there is now.
There was more...

but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.

This stuff's worth lots of money
in certain circles.

It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

Iittle by little.

Let me go!

Hey, Barney.

Remember me?

Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

that I've not been
read my rights?

I have not Mirandized Barney.

He is unaware of his rights.

When you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee Police--

They weren't civil to him,
and they're all dead now.

They only survived
his company three days.

You survived him six years
at the asylum.

How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

Yes, it was.

You ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

He once told me
that whenever feasible...

he preferred to eat the rude.

"Free-range rude,"
he called them.

What about you? You ever think
he might come after you?

You ever think about him at all?

At least thirty seconds
of every day.

I can't help it.

He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

Do you know what happened
to his stuff?

His books, papers, drawings--

Everything got thrown away
when the place closed--

cutbacks.

Barney, I just found out...

that Dr. Lecter's signed copy
of "The Joy of Cooking"...

was sold to a private collector
for $16,000.

It was probably a fake.

The seller's affidavit
of ownership...

was signed Karen Phlox.

Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

She filled out
your employment application...

only at the bottom,
she signed it "Barney."

Same thing on your tax returns.

You want the book?

Maybe I can get it back.

I want the X-ray they shot
after you broke Lecter's arm...

during the attack on that nurse.

And everything else you got.

We used to talk about
a lot of things at night.

After the screaming
finally died down...

We talked about you sometimes.

You want to know what he said?

Go get the X-ray.

-I'm not a bad guy.
-I didn't say you were.

Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.

After your first visit...

he started taping
your conversations with Lecter.

These...are valuable.

Go on, now.

You've grieved long enough.

And what'd he say?

What'd he say about me
late at night?

He was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behavior.

He used genetics
in roller pigeons as an example.

They fly way up in the air...

roll backwards in a display,
falling toward the ground.

There are shallow rollers,
and there are deep rollers.

You can't breed
two deep rollers...

or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down...

hit and die.

Agent Starling
is a deep roller, Barney.

Let us hope
one of her parents was not.

Surely,
the odd confluence of events...

hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

Jack Crawford dangles you
in front of me...

then I give you a bit of help.

Do you think it's because
I like to look at you...

and imagine how good
you would taste...

Clarice?

I don't know. Is it?

I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

What I want is a view.

I want a window where I can see
a tree...or even water.

I want to be
in a Federal institution...

far away from Dr. Chilton.

far away from Dr. Chilton.

The Capponi Correspondence
goes back to the 13th Century.

Dr. Fell might hold in his hand,
his non-ltalian hand...

a note from Dante Alighieri
himself...

but would he recognize it?
I think not.

Gentlemen, you have examined him
in Medieval ltalian...

and I will not deny that
his language is admirable...

for a straniero, but...

is he acquainted
with the personalities...

of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

I think not.

What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi Library...

say from Guido de Cavalcanti?

Would he recognize that?

I think not.

They're still arguing.

The Capponi Correspondence
goes back to the 13th Century.

Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

But the scholars
seem satisfied...

with the temporary guy
they appointed.

If he's such
an expert on Dante...

Iet him lecture on Dante
to the Studiolo.

Let him face them if he can.

I look forward to it.
Let's set a date.

Very well. On the 14th.

Dr. Fell?

Chief lnspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the Questura.

Commendatore.
How can I be of service?

I'm sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

of your predecessor...

Signore de Bonaventura.
I was wondering if--

"Predecessor" implies
I have the job.

Unfortunately, I don't. Not yet.

Though I am hopeful.

They are letting me
look after the library.

For a stipend.

The officers
who first checked...

didn't find any sort
of farewell or suicide note.

I was wondering if you--

If I come across anything
in the Capponi Library...

stuffed in a drawer or book...
I'll call you at once.

Thank you.

You've been reassigned.

Pardon?

You were on the Il Mostro case,
I'm sure I read.

Yes, that's right.

Now you're on this.

This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

yes, I guess I'd agree.

A missing person.

Sorry?

Were you unfairly dismissed
from the grander case or...

did you deserve it?

Regarding this one, Dr. Fell...

are the signore's
personal effects...

still at the palazzo?

Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

Alas...no note.

I'll send someone over
to pick them up.

Thank you for your help.

Thanks.

How's it goin'? Any leads?

Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

Oh, God.

This is from "The Guinness Book
of World Records"...

congratulating me on being
"The Female FBI Agent...

"Who Has Shot and Killed
the Most People."

Geoffrey,
would you excuse me, please?

Sure.

Dear Clarice...

I have followed
with enthusiasm...

the course of your disgrace
and public shaming.

My own never bothered me...

except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated.

But you may lack perspective.

In our discussions
down in the dungeon...

it was apparent to me
that your father...

the dead night watchman...

figures largely
in your value system.

I think your success
in putting an end...

to Jame Gumb's career
as a couturier...

pleased you most...

because you could imagine
your father being pleased.

But now, alas, you're in
bad odor with the FBl.

Do you imagine your daddy
being shamed by your disgrace?

Do you see him
in his plain pine box...

crushed by your failure?

The sorry, petty end
of a promising career?

What is worst about
this humiliation, Clarice?

Is it how your failure...

will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

Is your worst fear that people
will now and forever...

believe they were indeed...

just good old trailer camp,
tornado-bait, white trash?

And that perhaps you are, too?

By the way,
I couldn't help noticing...

on the FBl's
rather dull public website...

that I have been hoisted...

from the Bureau's archives
of the common criminal...

and elevated
to the more prestigious...

Ten Most Wanted List.

Is this coincidence,
or are you back on the case?

If so, goody goody.

I need to come out of retirement
and return to public life.

I imagine you sitting
in a dark basement room...

bent over papers
and computer screens.

Is that accurate?

Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.

Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M.D.

P.S.

Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

Rather, I suppose it is
part of the bargain...

but you accepted it, Clarice.

Your job is to craft my doom.

So I am not sure how well
I should wish you...

but I'm sure
we'll have a lot of fun.

Ta-ta. "H."

On the letter...

there's one partial fingerprint,
here.

Not enough to hold up in court,
but--

I know it's him.

Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

The paper isn't gonna help.

And, yes, it's linen fiber
and on the expensive side...

but, no, it isn't so rare
that you won't find it...

in a thousand different
stationary stores...

throughout the world.

It's the same with the ink.

And the same with the wax.

And your Las Vegas postmark,
well, you can check it out...

but I'll bet you a dollar it
came from a remailing service.

No, Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

I hardly see how you couldn't.

And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?

All right, then, tell me how.

No. It's your turn
to tell me, Clarice.

You have no more vacations
to sell on Anthrax lsland.

Quid pro quo, Clarice.

I tell you things,
you tell me things.

Not about this case.
About yourself.

Quid pro quo.

Yes or no, Clarice?

Hand cream.

Raw ambergris base.

Tennessee lavender.

Trace of something else.

Fleece.

Lovely.

What's ambergris?

Ambergris is a whale product.

Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

Endangered Species Act.

Where isn't it illegal?

Japan, of course.
Couple of places in Europe.

You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

Rome, Amsterdam.

Maybe London.

This bouquet was hand engineered
to someone's specifications.

Is there any way
of knowing which shops?

Of course.
We'll give you a list.

It'll be short.

I need opera tickets.

I don't think I got any on me.

It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

It's the pretty, young wife
with the ever-open beak...

who needs opera tickets.

Benetti.

What?

Rewind it.

I can't rewind it.

I'm making a copy.
I'm recording.

What is this?

Camera from a perfume shop
on Via Della Scala.

FBI through lnterpol
requested a copy.

-Why?
-They didn't say.

They didn't say?

No. It was actually
kind of weird...

Iike they were making
a point not to say.

Are we going to the opera?

Sorry.

Yes, we are going.

You got tickets.

No, but I will.

In fact,
I was just about to look here.

Please not the back row.

I would like to see it
this time.

Nowhere near the back row.

No matter what the cost.

Tell me, Clarice,
would you want to harm those...

who've forced you
to consider it, though?

It's perfectly OKto feel this.

It's perfectly au naturel
to want to taste the enemy.

It just feels so good.
Tell me, Clarice...

what is your worst memory
of childhood?

-Jesus, Starling!
-Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?

What you doing
sitting in the dark?

Thinking about cannibalism.

People in Justice
are thinking, too.

You know that?

They're thinking, "What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

And what's the point of that?

Are you writing a book
or you catching a crook?

To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

In the case of the flutist,
Benjamin Raspail...

he did it
to improve the sound...

of the Baltimore
Philharmonic Orchestra...

serving the not-so-talented
flute player's sweetbreads...

to the Board...

with a nice Montrachet
at $700 a bottle.

That meal began
with green oysters...

from the Gironde...

followed by the sweetbreads...

a sorbet...

and then you can read here
in "Gourmet Cuisine":

"A notable dark
and glossy ragout...

"the constituents
never determined."

I always figured him
for a queer.

Why would you say that, Paul?

Well,
all this artsy-fartsy stuff.

Chamber music, tea party food.

Not that I mean
anything personal...

if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

What I came here to impress
upon you, Starling...

is I better see cooperation.

There are
no little fiefdoms here.

I want to be copied
on every 3-0-2, understand?

If you work with me...

then your so-called career here
might improve.

If you don't,
then all I have to do...

is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

and it's over.

Paul, what is it with you?

I told you to go home
to your wife. That was wrong?

Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

That was a long time ago.

Why would I hold that
against you?

And besides, this town is full
of corn-pone country pussy.

That said, I wouldn't mind
having a go with you now...

if you want to reconsider.

In the gym, anytime.

No pads.

Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.

This was the day
after your request.

I did it right away.

I don't understand
what happened.

You should have it by now.

I don't.
Can you send me another one?

Sure. I will make another copy
especially for you...

Agent...Clarice?

Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

Agent Starling.

I'd appreciate it.

What's your name?

My name is Franco Benetti.
Agent Franco Benetti.

Thank you very much,
Agent Benetti.

-I'll send you tomorrow?
-All right.

Nothin', huh?

Nothin' yet.

Still waitin' on
Florence and London.

The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

Please check the numb--

I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?

I'm required to encourage you
to do so.

Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

May I suggest
you contact an attorney...

before taking
any possibly illegal action?

There's one in Geneva who is
excellent in these matters.

May I give you
his toll-free number?

The number is
0-0-4-1-2-3-3-1-7.

Thank you for calling.

I was just speaking
with someone--

There's a $100,000 advance.

To qualify for the advance...

a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

Once the print has been
positively identified...

the balance of the money
will be placed in escrow...

at Geneve Credit Suisse...

and may be viewed at any time...

subject to 24-hour
prior notification.

To repeat the message
in French, press two.

In Spanish, press three.

In German--

Buon giorno.

Dr. Fell? It's lnspector Pazzi.

Yes, I can see you.

Come on up.

Snap.

I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

The cases, I'm afraid,
are on the heavy side.

Maybe you could
help me with them.

Just down the stairs, I mean.

Yeah. This way.

Here we are.

Is that the inventory?

May I see it?

Of course.

You are a Pazzi of the...

Pazzi family, I think.

Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

Francesco de Pazzi?

Yes, thrown naked...

with a noose around his neck
from a window...

writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

against the cold stone wall.

In fact, I found a very nice
rendering of it here in the...

Iibrary the other day.

If you like, perhaps I could...

sneak it out for you.

I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

Only if you told.

Remind me, what was his crime?

He was accused of killing
Giuliano de Medici.

Unjustly?

No. I don't think so.

Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it, he was guilty.

I think that would make
living in Florence...

with the name Pazzi
uncomfortable...

even 500 years later.

Not really.

In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

before today...
someone brought it up.

People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

They just see to it you don't...

advance in life.

I'm sorry, Commendatore.

I too often say
what I'm thinking.

I'll be right back to help you.

The room you're standing in
was built in the 15th Century.

It's beautiful.

Yes, it is.

Unfortunately I think
the heating system...

was installed
about the same time.

That's a pity.

Okey-dokey,
let's drag these down.

They must be as heavy as bodies.

And the set?

Eight thousand.

-How much is this?
-50,000.

I'll take it.

Scusi, signor.

Well done.

Gnocco.

When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

I have done this a few times,
lnspector.

Not like this.

If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Collicciano.

Give me the bracelet.

Wash your fucking hands.

He's coming.

Grazie.

I got it.

He grabbed me just right.

Tried to hit me in the balls.

But he missed.

Let me help you.

No. Don't.

Sixteen point match, Mr. Verger.

Bingo.

Pronto.

Carlo?

Mason?

Ciao, bello. Come stai?

Very well. Well.

Am I coming to see you?

Yes. Soon, I hope.

But...

first, I need you
to pack off the boys.

-Now?
-Yes, I know.

The day you never thought
would arrive has.

Cordell will fax
the veterinary forms...

directly to Animal
and Plant Health...

but you need to get the vet
affidavits from Sardinia.

Va bene?

Bene, bene.

How are they?

They are big, Mason--
very big.

Tommaso.

Say again?

They are big, Mason--
really big.

Maybe 270 kilos.

Can you hear?

Hear!

They sound fantastic.

Super.

The full balance of the money...

is payable upon receipt
of the doctor alive.

Of course, you won't have
to seize him yourself...

rather just point him out.

In fact, it's preferable
to all concerned...

if that's the extent
of your involvement...

from this point.

I prefer to stay involved--
to make sure things go right.

Professionals will see to that.

I am a professional.
