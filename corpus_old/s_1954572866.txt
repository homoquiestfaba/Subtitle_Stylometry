inhospitable wasteland

But even here,
at the bottom of the frozen earth,

And not any life

charming and affectionate life.

Look at them, tumbling to

Who could take these

Who cares?
I'm not asking for anything.

Neither do I!

We're cool!

Thus philandering advance series

Captain, it seems, we bezletovi.

Well fine, which

I like it!
This could be our thing!

What do you think?
Call it high applause!

Hey, did you see that? It is an egg!
It will not take someone?

We can not.
Why not?

Outside is a dangerous world.
And we just penguins.

You know, we are nothing,
a charming and affectionate.

Amen, why do you think us
documentarians still filming?

I'm sorry, baby. A few eggs
we lose every year. Such is the nature.

Oh well, nature.
I guess it makes sense, but

Daco deep in my belly
tells me that it does not make sense.

You know what?
I refuse to nature!

Who is with me?

Old ship! Nobody
stade yet returned alive!

Calm down, Kovalsky down there
is a bird. Look, he's fine.

Leopard seals! Natural snakes.
There are snakes natural snakes?

How do I know? Living
in a strange frozen tundra!

They're coming after the egg!
Run me down immediately!

It would be enough for us
collect30 feet seaweed...

Small and helpless Penguin
are frozen with fear.

They know that if they fall
of this cliff, surely die.

Gunter, push them.

Training jellyfish we've learned
listen to simple voice commands.

That's how it went!

Go ahead, Riko.
Do not let them get it!

Okay.
That would go.

Gets higher!

Success.

I recommend it now detonate.
No detain them.

It is time to detonate.
Not until we see the whites of their eyes.

They usually pupil, very
little white. Almost none.

They have very little white, though?
None at all.

And what if the eyes look
far left?

Shoot in the hole!

Kowalski, analysis?

In this we really amazing!

Guys, we did it!
Mission accomplished.

We can do our high applause!

Why would he not know?
Nobody is not going to die!

No, baby. Do you have a family,
you got us. We have each other.

If this is not the family,
then I do not know what is.

Such cute.

Kowalski, what is our path?
95% certainly perish.

And the other5%?

Then take action!
Where are we going?

Penguins are our body and kind.
They are us.

A single one of us can save us.

But Captain, we are at5 mil.
This significantly limits our options.

I'll do my custom options.

A great move, Captain.

But now it seems,

On a good plan must be more than
fancy stuff and selected words.

Oh, and you, you certainly
you know a good plan.

I think that your operations in Shanghai
Dave allowed to run off with your boys.

I've never lost
member of his team.

It must be awful feeling.

I can not imagine
the guilt, remorse.

The feeling you know,
You should have it.

Who is behind schedule penguins?

Who is behind schedule Norther?

His

it is better.

What?

Sorry guys, but this time
you can not lead.

We are a team and you're our captain.
We do not need these guys.

We do not Kovalsky,
but Pesak yes.

I think this time
Leave professionals.

Oh, Lord!
It's decided.

Now bend to secret agent.

That's an order, Riko!

Well hidden,
what is the diversion?

This is a shame we take to my grave.
I agree.

Time?
22:00,

Time to beat Dave!

Octopus David,

show me their tentacles.

All of them.

I think we lost them, Captain.

It's about time these pants
do not wear it in my Bundesliga.

Quickly boys, take your
coconuts and firmly hold them.

Utajeny should go
from massive explosions

s pawn on his shoulders
for3 ...2...

Greet him home again, Riko!

The infantryman is back!
Welcome home!

Sir, the submarine did not explode.

And I'm afraid that fireworks
was probably a tactical mistake.

<i>Stay calm!
Do not panic! Still to win!</i>

His delight in! Stop hating!
Dream away! Love it! Love other people!

Judiciously choose life combat.
Do not let anyone control.

Eva!

I know.

Welcome! The captain, a Kovalsky
avid Riko! There's a whole gang!

The mood is electrifying.
They really are all finally here?

Well Dave. But what
did... pawn!

Oh buddies.
Now in porridge, Dave!

Really? Anyway,
timely speech.

Who else is ready
to test penguins live?

Immediately put away the
death ray from Pesci!

It is not deadly, Captain,
but change us monsters!

Tralala! And what comes
then, Dave?

Invasion! Fearful
mutated penguins

Discharge into the streets
New York!

You're a monster.
Yes, I'm a monster

all it gave me clear
every day of my life.

But now let's see how much you will
all love when you're going monsters.

Captain!

You can not take pawns tenderness.
It's a feature!

What?
That's all it is the babe!

Hm. Si supermilucky.
I prefer to run.

Drew, Barry, more electricity.

Are you ready?
Negotiations have been infringed.

Riko, paperclip.
Get us out of here.

We need that clip.
Shot soldier!

Riko where the clip?

Pawn!

No!

Pawn!
For them.

I had disintegrated.

That's what I expected.

You maniac!
He crushed it.

No.

Well. Because of this,
things we test people.

I'll have to shrink
current for others.

Full steam ahead, gentlemen.

Monsters must come to Manhattan.

Sorry.

Uh-oh.

Well, octopus!

Anything you Dave promised
I can double it!

This indicates yes? Do you understand
someone speech octopus?

I'm sorry.
I do not know.

Vanity.

Ty Free us.
My give you benefits!

What is it?

No, great.
No, it's terrible!

I do not want to die battered.

Dead, dead, dead, dead.

Oh no, We're dead!

Dead.

Dead!

I pressed the button!

Super, great Pesak!
Well done, little one!

Aano, yes, great
pressing a button!

Compliment, respect, etc.

Well agents Again we work.

Wait!
Captain, Kovalsky, Riko

and all penguins are this way!

There is a large Army octopuses.

And as soon as we return to our base
and take your new gear

and think of new destructive plan
quickly come and beat Dave.

But penguins are endangered!
We have to go now.

Again, large Army octopuses.

So because you have one
failed, are you running?

We failed and run away,

Just be very careful regroup.

Captain would not bother
plan or not, great outfit or not.

He would never left the man.

I believe that everyone
Penguins can not be, right?

No.

But maybe you should be.

Let's go.

It's showtime,
big smiles for New York!

Listen, Doris. You're changing the
the madman, but then what?

Think you why
everyone will love?

No, but I despise you.

And I like it surely enjoy it!

Special Report!
Disappearance penguins were found!

According to my notes, gene
engineer Dr. Oktavius Brine

found penguins and brings them
here in Central Park in NY

Penguins are returning!
Wow Oh look!

Look!

Lovers penguins around the world

I believe that love them

It was not easy

But the prospect that the penguins get everything
what belongs to them, it will be worth it.

What a strange speech.
I'm so excited!

Do it.

Captain, Captain, Captain,
Riko, Kovalsky!

As if I've ever heard
his voice calling us.

<i>You have to go
stade away! Move it!</i>

You have to go
stade away. Mou!

Why would Mukalla?
Why are you asking me?

I'm not a pawn, Oh dear.

No!

Are you ready?

Yes!

Your new

and improvements

penguins!

Penguins! Penguins!

What?

Oh, people love you.
Just hug!

For them. Is it me?
Nobody does not like anymore?

Thus, a cheerful game begins.
Watch penguins.

Someone call liquidators!

<i>Pest control / penguin</i>

And when you remove liquidators,
never more return!

Oh dear! Oh no! Oh no!
What should I do?

Ojoj!

Come on. Do you want to go?
Want to guess?

Oho, this!

What a wonderful day in the park.

Captain.

Wait.

For them.
What are you doing?

Captain.

Do not eat it.

Captain, listen.

It's me, pawn.

I have a plan, but
I need your help.

I need his captain.

<i>The family Pesak</i>

Pawn?
Yes, exactly.

Pawn, you're alive!

Yes.

Kovalsky, wake up!

Kovalsky, Eva worried about you.

Really? What did she say?
Explicitly said my name?

I think that even with tears?
Details! Speak up!

Pawn, you're alive!
Come here.

Maybe it does not fit here,
But I'm happy.

Riko, you have control.

Although I think it
so normally did.

Female friend!

Attention!

It seems that we
back again, boys

and our work Save the penguins.

Who is added?
I'm in.

Join.
Let's do it!

Let's create a memorable moment.

Sir, how long have
thus we stand?

Until we achieve
maximum splendor.

And there is. Now only
we need a plan.

I got the poison!

You stole Dave beam?

I found that if you we can turn

and return all to normal!

Consult beam?
This is brilliant

but impossible.
To turn beam

we would have to replace
Serum jellyfish

drive almost immense tenderness.

Measureless tenderness,
where we gathered it?

No, wait a pawn!
We do not know what I would do!

All right!
The beam works!

Pawn, are you okay?
Yes!

Ble, hand on my ass!

He's ass stuck his hand.
That was not there before.

Get out of there.
That's an order!

Permission to disobey.
Enabling rejected.

Then refuse your refusal.

Too risky pawn.
Have you increased the hand.

I know that this time my turn.

And I think you know it well.

I have a secret weapon.

I am happy yet

Now, when I his revenge

I feel empty, like everything

I needed all the time,
was more revenge!

Actually, Robin,
this registration.

Tomorrow we go the kittens

then the dog, bunny, Panday!

Charlize, are farewell.

Helena, and take them.

William, hurting them.

Halle, their trench.

Hugh, Jack, above our station.

Kevin furnace!

I still do not have
winning cake!

We have just one shot, boys.

What we do it comes with globes?

Beam splitter ready!
Fire as needed!

Do it, Captain!

Discharged flashlights!

End of the game, Captain.

No!

Riko, flashlights.

Captain, Kovalsky,
Vehicle protection.

Let's do it now!

Did you hear Pesca?
Go!

<i>Batteries</i>

<i>Cheese puffs</i>

Riko go from the other side!

We're just two
and they are many.

You are returned!

Au, so we have to be
Explosion cautious.

Maintain position!

Stay away from pawn!

Suck, Kovalsky?

No!

It's over, Captain.

The end?
This is weird.

So why do Riko bears
fresh pair of batteries!

Driver!

Riko, give me crackers!

<i>Pest control New York</i>

It works!

Pawn.

Sorry. We walk.
Come down the aisle!

Oh no!
Do not worry!

Just around you creates
hood, it is completely normal.

Pawn.

Pawn?

Check out majestic!

Ahojte.

What is it?
Oh no, cautiously.

Cautiously.
Cover your eyes.

Wobbles his head.
What is it?

So

How do I look?

Your head is
hideously disfigured

and probably
will be hunted for sport.

What?
Very.

If anything, What we learned

this stunning
adventure, Kovalsky,

then, that
on the appearance does not matter.

Counted Only deeds

a view to performed work.

Yes sir, you were the most important
a valuable member of this team.

Ramirez!

Dave.
Dave.

What?
Mocking me?

Dave, oh look it.

<i>Do you think it's over?
I'm just starting to...</i>

What happened to him we do now?

<i>Immediately open!</i>

Whether you like it girl!

Great!

I hope you find lucky Dave.

It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing!

Snowden correctly!
It is hard to say this.

It is osteoporosis?
You just have to accustom

vowels.
O-you-o-po-ro-za.

No! No.

I mean

you four bravest Agents know.

The thing that I
wrong in you and hope

it can make amends.

Give us jetpack!
We could kiss.

After... you just said?

That was nice.

I'd rather
Desired jetpack, please.

I think that we should
accept the idea of ??the pawns.

Kovalsky what is our trajectory?

95% of land on on wood?

What do you mean trouble?

And the other5%?
They are irrelevant, sir.

Jetpack are amazing!
Consent.

Who says Penguins do not fly?

Captain, have you got me
reverting to normal.

Right, of course. How
The first thing on Monday.

<i>Thursday afternoon</i>

I am a piggy bank.

I want to push the button.
Give it here.

Let's do it, I'm ready!
Well, at 3, One, 3 start!

Only do small training grip.

Well I'm not going to press.
Au, after I got claws!

Hey, look over there!

Laser show!

Julien!

This is an infantryman whose
we know and love.

High applause!

Measurable glamor here.
Good to be back.

I am ok!
And we saved charm.
