he was released on bail,
pending trial.

His arraignment hearing
had been set for Monday.

He didn't show up.

The troopers
made every effort.

[papers rustling]

Do you know
what this is?

This is very
high quality.

The ink color
is perfect.

The paper is good.

The weight,
watermark, plate work,

it's all meticulous.

There's even
a metal strip embedded.

In six months,
he had passed almost $50,000.

He printed $50,000?
No, Ms. Vogel.

He passed $50,000.
He printed $22 million.

He was facing
a maximum of 75 years.

Um, may I hold it?

[paper rustling]

[sighs softly]

It's beautiful.

My father...

he died
a hundred times

poking holes
in his veins,

like so many rehearsals
for our ultimate rejection.

We get pretty good
at it, don't we?

his attention,</i>

accommodated that.</i>

<i>As wholeheartedly
as he abandoned it.</i>

<i>The idea is that,

I'm awake.

You wanna come up here?
Yeah.

[music continues

Move right here.
That's right.

Those are the basics.

I'll just be here

No!

I can't... I can't

Sure you can.

Look at how long
those legs are.

That's it,
just keep it right there.

No, Daddy,
please don't leave me!

you gotta learn how to drive.

It's the only way you're

Just take care because
there's a bend up here

An hour?

["Nocturne Op. 9,

called Dad Peter Pan,</i>

<i>for the kind of
silly charm</i>

<i>that allowed him to make
reckless, impulsive decisions</i>

<i>look like perfect
plans of action.</i>

<i>In those times,</i>

<i>he always wanted to make
things perfect for us.</i>

<i>Replace the humdrum
of everyday life</i>

<i>with new places

<i>He purchased the farm on a
payment plan he couldn't afford.</i>

<i>It was a dilapidated

You kids are like

It'll be better

Nick?

You, too?

There are things about your
father that you don't know.

Like what?

When you're older...
I am older!

Nick, we're leaving.

Go! Get outta here!

[serene music playing]

[John and Jennifer
screaming joyfully]

Oh, there's gotta be some
kind of mistake, Beck!

My kids are much
smaller than these two.

Look at that little
button nose.

Look at you two.

Now go and get your bags
from Uncle Beck's truck.


I really appreciate
you bringing them down.

How's their mama?

How do you think she
is, you bastard?

You left her with
two kids and no dough.

That was bust,
I had to make a move.

I see
your moves, John.

Man, you had
a good girl

heart all over the street.

You know what?

She'll get back

In the meantime, you just take
good care of her babies, okay?

It's not like that.
I mean, they are my babies, too.

Yeah, yeah.
See ya.

I'd do anything

Yeah. Prove it.

If it doesn't marinate,

it's not pepper steak,

I'll take just steak.

Too late, it's marinating.

He thinks
that way sometimes?

What's so funny?

You're lucky he left.

When he comes crawling
back to you...

I come to you to borrow
a few hundred bucks.

Not to judge
my husband.

The year
you got hitched,

John bought the cabin
at Browns Lake.

You spent all summer
doing it up.

The day he left,
it burns to the ground.

Then bought
the burger joint.

Spent weeks making pretty,
pretty tablecloths.

It was pretty.

But spent nothing
on the kitchen.

And then a hardworking
Black fella

opens up a better burger
joint across the street,

and lo and behold,

John's place burns
to the ground.

He'd burn down
the world

if he thought it would
put him in white mansions.

Patty.

That guy's so fucking stupid.

My name is Cheryl,
and I'm an alcoholic.

[all] Hi, Cheryl.
I came here and I had...

lost everything.

I lost my home
and my career,

and my darling husband.
I say that now.

A year ago, I thought
he was a piece of shit

who dropped me by the curb,
but you know something,

I was so angry,
and I needed someone to blame,

and I could not see
that it was on me.

Good morning, ladies.

Now, that is the way
you make coffee.

All right,
I'm out of here.

you guys start
without me.

What are you doing?
What is that?

It's resin.
You want some?

It's not bad.

Don't push me,
little lady.

What are you trying
to prove, Jennifer?

Nothing.
Hell, it's 8:55 in the morning,

I'm just trying to
take the edge off.

You show some respect!

Why?
I'm still your mother.


How long you been
smoking that stuff?

Oh, please!
[Patty] Answer me!

you hypocrite!

Answer me,
you little slut!

You big slut.

Oh. You don't get
to fucking hit me.

Ever!

[breath trembling]

[sobbing softly]

I'm gonna miss you.

so much.


Honey, we need to talk.

I'm leaving.

Jennifer!
What?

Don't think
you're taking the car.

Doc paid for that car.

I don't want
his fucking car.

I never wanna see
that sick fuck again.

How dare you?
After all he's done for you!


And where are you gonna
go, Jennifer?

You don't have anywhere
Yes, I do!

Yes, I do, Mom.

Oh, Jen.

Jen, I may be dumb,

but you're a smart girl.
Don't kid yourself.

Like I'm passing up
a great gig here?

There are things about your
father that you don't know.

Oh, God,
here we go again,

are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

that he's a con man

or a swindler.
Mom, this is your shit!

It's nothing to do with
my relationship with him!

...he believes his own lies!
[gasps]

Okay, let's talk about
believing your own lies,

shall we?

Let's talk about
protecting your children!

It's your one fucking
job to protect me!

Listen to me,
your father is a liar.

He's a liar.
Shut up! Please, shut up!

Look, I know what I
am, he doesn't.

And if you're gonna
go with him,

pretty soon,
you won't either.

You won't.
I'm done. I'm done.

I'm done!
I'm done! [crying]

Your father...
Your father is a liar.


I can't do this
anymore!

Stop! Stop!

Don't touch me!
Listen to me, Jennifer!

He looks you
square in the eyes

and he shows
you his heart,

and it is a lie!
Get out of my way!

Get the fuck out of my way!

What kind of journalism?

Investigative, maybe.

I like that.

I can see

I mean, for a living.
What do you do for a living?

You know what
I do for living.

I'm an entrepreneur.

My skill is
opportunities.

Like what?

For instance,

right now,
I got a whole raft of businesses.

I'm working a very
broad portfolio.

And when you
work it that way,

you're not depending
on one business

butter, you know?

Yield goes
down on one,

pops up
on another.

And the good
news is,

that I'm doing really
great with that.


What's that?

[Jennifer shudders
and sniffles]

moving out of Mom's.

I can't stand it
there anymore.

Sorry.

It's okay.


What's the problem,
Jennifer?

Are you mixed up
in drugs?

No?

So, what's
the problem?

I just gotta get out.

I thought maybe I could
come live with you.

[clears throat]

That kind of comes
out of the blue.

Some things in life
are about timing.

Timing, you see.
See, uh, right now,

I'm growing the business.
Businesses.

And it takes all
the time God sends.

I've just got
a lot of...

Yeah, I understand. It's...

But I gotta keep
the plates spinning.

I gotta keep the
balls in the air.

It's okay, Dad.
It's really... It's fine.

I just want a fresh
start, you know?

Dad, I lied.

In Sheboygan,
I did a lot of drugs.

I smoked weed,
I did a lot of speed.

Coke. [sighs]

I just did stupid
things, you know?

I'm angry at you.

You're smarter
than that.

Don't think
I couldn't tell.

It's not
my first rodeo.

Have you done drugs?

Never! Oh.

Uh, in some
medical circles,

alcohol is
classed a drug,

so is tobacco.

So, I'm not gonna
sit here

and tell you that I've
never enjoyed a vodka gimlet

on a Sunday afternoon.

And, oh, what's this?

Exhibit A, methinks.

[chuckles lightly]
So, yes.

But no, I've never
done drugs.

Narcotics...
Are you kidding me?

At the cabin,
you had those plants in the cupboard.

I used to sit up
8at night

and see you and Debbie
roll joint after joint.

And I also saw you
doing lines.

I found coke
in your drawer.

Don't change
the subject.

I'm not changing
the subject, I saw you.

And how old were you?
How could you possibly remember?

I remember.
I saw it, Dad.

You didn't.
Yes, I did.

You didn't.
I did.

You didn't. You didn't.
Yes, I did. I did.

You didn't.
You done?

Am I done?
With your food?

Yeah.
All right, let's go.

Can I drive?

Since when do you
know how to drive?

Since I was 11.
Someone told me it was the only way

to see the world.
Remember?

Must have been
a pretty smart someone.

Here.

God damn it!

[John farts, mutters]

[engine starting]

Can we finish
our conversation?

Jennifer, whatever it was
that you think you saw,

or you saw,
or you think you're alleging...

Dad, I just think we should
be straight with each other.

We should tell
each other the truth.

I told you the truth.


I've got
some problems.

Not drug problems.
Not drugs.

Um, business.

And I owe some people
some money,

some big mistakes
I made.

Thank you
for telling me.

I don't want
to be a burden.

[John sighs]

It's not a burden.

Like I've been saying,
it's a fresh start.

Let's get you
whipped into shape.

No more darkness!

Whoa! Whoa, Jen!
No more hiding

from beautiful things.
Whoa, whoa!

You know, Dad,
these people you owe money to, Dad,

you can just tell them
you're getting a new job.

A fresh start.

[papers rustling]

Advertising."

[clipper whirring]
"Appraising.

Apartment Building.
Architect.

Artist. Art Supply
salesman.

Antique trader.
Applicator." Those are just the As.

You're not 39, Dad.

Well, I shaved
a couple years off.

I thought
we were being honest.

Also, you're listing way
too many areas of expertise.

It's a resume, Jennifer.

They expect you
to lie on a resume.

Everybody lies on a
resume, they factor it in.

Oh, don't go too short
on the top,

it makes me
look beak-ish.

[instrumental music playing]

All right now,
the pay is okay slash not great.

It's $2.50 an hour,

raise up to $3.50 after
the first six months.

That's great.
It works for me.

Sir, hi. Can I have a
moment of your time? Okay.

Hello. Hi.
My name's Jennifer. Okay.

Great.
Yeah, absolutely.

Thank you for supporting such
a great cause, that's awesome.

[indistinct chatter]

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

[sirens wailing
in the distance]


[Jennifer] You did?
Yeah.

You're looking at the
new executive manager

for Sailfeather
Floatplanes.

Dad, that's fantastic.
Yeah.

Well, it's a long way
out of town.

A managerial
position, sure.

And they made me lay out
for a fancy new briefcase.

But it's a job.

We should celebrate.

Yeah.

There's a sensitive
topic I've got to raise.

I come home
from work

and I have
a little stress.

And I wind down...
We've covered this.

I keep a little
Thai stick

in that carved canoe
on my dresser.

And I went to my
little carved canoe...

Jennifer, have you
touched my stash?

Yes.
Yes?

I'm sorry,
I didn't think you would notice.

Okay, calling
a house meeting.

Rule number one,
you stay away from my stash. Agreed?

Agreed.
Rule number two,

you can smoke,
but do it behind my back.

Or we could
smoke together?

Don't you understand the
concept of boundaries?

Look, Jennifer,
don't disappoint me.

I'm off having to be
the boss of many men

in the bureaucratic
world all day.

I get home,
I wanna know I've got my weed.

Agreed?

Agreed.

Okay, this one's
not a rule,

but just consider changing
your hair color back.

Goodnight, darling,
I'm going to bed.

You're drawing?

You bought
yourself a car?

Something like that,

I dropped 400 bucks to
see how long it'll last.

How was work?

You're home
kinda early.

You know, I wanna
show you something.

Sit yourself down.

What's that?

Uh...

It's a jean stretcher.

It makes
jeans longer.

Really?
Yeah.

Well, you know how my
jeans are always too short,

but they're fine
when I buy them.

It's just when I put them in the
wash, they shrink,

and millions of people
have that problem.

Observe.

See how that works?

See? $12.95 for one

and $25 for two.

That sound fair to you?
Sure.

Let me show you the art.
It's for the ad.

I've already paid for it to
run in the paper next week,

but I've gotta check
my pennies in the piggy.


It's a great thing to have
alongside the day job.

Exactly, snicklefritz.

It just, it goes along
with the whole big raft.

Now, don't go
anywhere,

there's a lot more
I wanna tell ya.

I had a couple of
other opportunities.

I got offered
a couple other jobs,

even better money,
but they're all labor.

I could never
do that.

In the workplace,

I'm strictly

I was reading recently

about the power of
the subconscious mind

secretly divine for us.

Nothing. Nothing.

Well, I cut myself.

talking about?

It's not even a cut.
[John] Yeah.

What is it?

What happened?

Jennifer...
It's red raw,

Dad, this is important.

When did you decide
to do this?

Jen, I... [sputters]
Listen. I've been asked

a lot of questions lately
and I'm a little...

Shut up!
I've been getting asked

a lot of questions
lately, Jen!

Then answer mine!

Oh.

Okay, okay. Come on.

No, no, no, no!

Come on, baby!
[guard] That's it.

Just one more second,
I promise.

Answer the fucking
question,

just tell me
the truth!

You're only interested in
what the cops' story is.

I can't see what
you're talking about.


[John sighs,

I need to know when
you decided to do this.

you, Jennifer.

It... It just is
more complicated

than that, come on.
So, you're innocent?

You don't... [sputters]

You don't get it yet,

you're gonna get it when
you walk a mile in my shoes.

You're gonna
understand, trust me.

You're gonna understand one

[Jennifer] Thank you.
You're welcome.

So, why did you lie
on your application?

I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

Your references
don't pan out.

We contacted your high
school in Sheboygan.

You dropped out
with Fs and Ds.

Sorry, there's...
There's been a mistake.

Miss Vogel,
there is no one

by the name of
John Vogel

Insurance in Seattle.

I'm not lying!
You can't BS your way

into the University
of Minnesota.

Who's that?

You're right.

My dad's a bank robber.
He's spending 15 years

in an Arizona
federal penitentiary,

and I flunked
out of school.

Sorry for wasting
your time.

Hold it, Jennifer.

Your sample articles,
you did write those.


Seems to me
that a person

to be a journalist

has to have an awfully
strong motivation

Yes. Yes.

But all these
things are true,

So, take "yes"
for an answer.

You're not worried about
backlash from Brentax?

No! If there's backlash,
I'll blame the whole thing on who?

[Jennifer] Fucking Vogel.
Fucking Vogel.

I survived this business
pretty well playing good cop.

Well, I'll be twirling
my moustache.


Is that you,
number one?

You're... You're
all grown up.

You look terrific.

You look just terrific.

When did you
get out?

I was just
wondering if...

maybe you could pull
away for an hour,

come have lunch
with me?

Um...

I mean, not if
it's bad timing.

No, it's fine,
I can get an early lunch.

Let me just
grab my purse.

Oh, I've got money.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

I mean, I just...
Okay. Oh, sure.

Sure, I'll wait here.

I'll be right back.
Okay.


I didn't know
you were getting out.

Did you tell anyone?

Did anybody
pick you up?

The truth is,
I've actually been out for a while.

How long?

A year and a bit.

A year and a bit?
What the hell?

You don't
call or write

and you've been out
a year and a bit?

I wrote you
a hundred times

from prison.
I didn't hear anything back.

No response, nothing.

Why would I think
anything would change

when I got out here?

Did you even read
any of my letters?

I was kind of on the
road for a while.

I got 'em
when I got back,

and I read some
of them. I just...

What have you been
doing for over a year?

Well, I got a...
I got a business.

A little, uh,

print and copy business
down at Center City.

It's called Center City Print & Copy.
Catchy, huh?

A print shop?
Yep.

How did you
afford that?

I wouldn't go
too far there.

I mean, it was only a
couple thousand down.

Previous owner had bad business
sense and terminal cancer.

It's a tiny
business,

but I do have
one account.

One client that's, you
know, a pretty big deal,

that covers me
all right.

In fact, I was able, recently,

to do something I've been
dreaming about for...

a long time.


I took a one-month
rental...

of a cabin

up at the lake where
we spent that summer.


And matter of fact,

I was thinking
of going out there

this weekend,
just for a day.

I don't have
a lot of time,

parole and all that,

so I'd like to make
the time special

if I'm gonna
spend time there.

I thought maybe you
and I'd go open her up.

Barbecue,

take the boat out
on the lake.

Um, I don't
think I can.

Well, hey,
let's see...

How about this following
weekend, what's that, uh...

[paper rustling]

That's the, uh...
I have to work next weekend.

Hey, how about the
weekend after that?

That'd be the 30th.

I don't know,
I have to check.

why don't you check,

and if you can't
make it,

we can do it the weekend after that.
I'm pretty flexible.


This is it. <i>Chez moi.</i>

It's not that bad.

I'll be getting out
in a few weeks.

[Jennifer sighs]

I just don't know if I'm
ready for any of this, Dad.

It's a lot.

[John sighs softly]

So, you have
my number.

[pats pocket]
I do. I do.

So, you'll let me know
if you change your mind.

Come by.

Yeah.
And I'm flexible.

You know, I could do pretty
much any time you want.

Um...

Well, I, uh...

I'm just so
proud of you,

it felt...
it was so great to see you.

I mean, all that
you've achieved.

I guess what remains to be said,

and I hope
you believe this...

is that...
people do change.

Can you please pick up?</i>

[phone ringing, beeps]

<i>Hey, Jen.
I know you're busy.</i>

<i>Just wanted to
remind you that</i>

<i>there's a beautiful lake
one phone call away.</i>

[young Jennifer]
Texas, Utah,

Vermont, Virginia,

<i>Washington,
West Virginia,</i>

Wisconsin, Wyoming.


<i>You've got a,
a delicate kind of beauty.</i>

You got
delicate features,

like I did
when I was your age.

Your nose, your eyes,

and I see that
little gap closed

twixt your teeth.
[chuckles]

When you're older,

you'll have a more
unusual beauty.

People gotta look real hard to see
it, but if they look,

<i>they'll see it,
'cause it's there.</i>

<i>I think the greatest
hope a man can have</i>

<i>is to leave something
beautiful behind.</i>

Something that
he made.

happy you came out here.

[geese honking]

Jennifer...

I want to apologize.

I had a long time to...

to reflect on
my mistakes.

I've mulled it...

and weighed
my responsibilities,

and I want to apologize...
for what happened.

You know, all of it.

The other day,

when you dropped me
at the halfway house,

I was watching
you drive away

and I thought
to myself,

"What can I do
to help?

What can
you do, John,

to give her
something real,

something practical?"

So, last Tuesday,
right after we met,

I called a dealer
I know

and I put a $5,000
deposit down

on a 1989 XJS Jaguar,
flamenco red,

biscuit leather
interior and top.

I mean, it's a stunner
and drives like new.

What are you
talking about, Dad?

You've had
all this time

and this is how
you're talking?

It's a fantasy.
Oh, is that so?

Says who?
I don't want a Jaguar.

You don't want a Jaguar?
It's a fantasy.

It's a fucked-up
fantasy.

Does a $5,000 deposit sound
like a fantasy to you?

I just wanna go back in.
Jen.

Just take me back in.
I... I need...

I need you to believe in me.
Dad!

We got so far
to go, Jen!

I'm cold.

What did I say?
What happened?

I'm cold,
just take me back in.

Here. Here.
Take my jacket.

I don't want your jacket.
Just take my jacket.

wanna go back in.

I don't want it.
Take my jacket.

I don't want
your fucking jacket!

Ah, Mr. Sullivan.

Yes. This is
John Vogel.

I'm the one that
put down the deposit

on the flamenco red
1989 Jaguar XJS,

biscuit leather
interior and top.

Exactly.

Due to some unforeseen
circumstances,

we're not gonna
be able to proceed.

Uh-huh.
No, I'm aware.

See, the thing is,
it's that the car was for my daughter,

and, uh,
she changed her mind.

She doesn't
like the car.

Yeah.

No.

Anyway, yeah, well,
it's a long story,

but I think we need to talk
about the $5,000 deposit.

I understand
your policy, sir,

but you gotta have
some flexibility here.

Well, for instance,
how about, um,

you know, 50% back
on the deposit.


Okay, how about 40%?

40%.
You keep $3,000.

Dad! Fuck!

I have to put you on
hold for a second.


I'll call you straight back.
Oh, my God.


Jennifer!

[indistinct
commentary on tv]

[crowd cheering]

Two years ago,
a group of school kids

from Minnesota Country
School went on a field trip

to study pond life on a
farm in Le Sueur County,

a farm that backs on
to the Lyle-Hasco plant.

This is what
they found.

[button clicks]

Miss Vogel,

how much do you know
about pesticides?

How much study have you
devoted to the field?

One, two nights up
drinking coffee?

Perhaps you even
went to a library.

The building I work in,
Lyle-Hasco HQ,

is a two-story,
big, flat building.

And on one of those floors
is guys in white coats,

and the other
is lawyers.

Can you guess
which one I'm on?

A school field trip?

And you let me
be clear,

if <i>Hippie Papers</i>
prints one more

of this
unsubstantiated garbage,

we will sue you all the
way back to Haight-Ashbury.

I'm not a lawyer,

and I'm not
a scientist,

but Dr. Lee Nobles from
Minnesota State University is,

and is the leading
proponent

of amphibian research
in the United States.

He's also a part of the
team investigating Brentax.

It's a two-year study,

and he's publishing
his findings this week.

If Brentax
is in the water,

then that's the water
Minnesotans drink,

give to their children,
take baths in,

make coffee with.

I just wondered if
you cared to comment.
