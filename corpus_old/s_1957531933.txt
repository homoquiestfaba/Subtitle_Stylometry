Buddy.

(Buddy laughing faintly)

Mm. (laughs)

You've always
been there for me, Buddy.

Buddy: Hey,
you can count on me, okay?

Anything you need, man.
I'll be there.

(Buddy slurping)

<i>(slurping continues)</i>

(man grunts)

(screen dinging)

<i>(voices sped up
in high-pitched tone)</i>

<i>Welcome to
Cap'n Kelly's Chicken,</i>

<i>home of the new
Chicken Shake.</i>

<i>What can I get you today?</i>
Chicken Shake?

<i>One Chicken Shake.
Anything else?</i>

No, no, no. I don't want a Chicken Shake.
I was just asking what is it?

<i>Our new Chicken Shake,
made with real blended chicken meat</i>

<i>and whipped gravy,
all under 500 calories.</i>

<i>Would you like to try one?</i>

No, no, no, no.
I'll just take a Barnyard Bucket.

<i>For an extra dollar,
you can upgrade to a Mega Barnyard Bucket.</i>

Okay, sure.

<i>Okay, so I got
a Mega Barnyard Bucket</i>

<i>with extra double gravy,
smooth, and a medium Red Rocket.</i>

<i>Will that be all?</i>

Yeah, I'll try one
of those Chicken Shakes too.

Oh, hello.

Preble: Hi,
are you Miss Arabella Isadora?

Ah, just one second.
I'll get her for you.

Okay.

(foreboding synthesizer music)

Arabella Isadora
at your service.

What can I do for you,
young man?

Ma'am, did you
send me this letter?

Ah, yes,
I suppose I did.

Ms. Isadora, it appears we
have no tax records for you.

Please call me Bella.

Bella, it appears we have no tax
records for you or your property.

Ooh, I see.

I'm here to perform
a preliminary audit.

Uh, so you'd like
to come in?

Yes ma'am,
the sooner I get started,

the sooner I'll be
out of your hair.

Out of my hair
and into my home.

To enter, you must lick
the ice cream cone.

No thank you.

No thank you.

It's melting, dear.

(pensive synthesizer music)

(music box crank whirring)

(music box tinkling music)

Okay, and what is your
occupation or former occupation?

I... I never know
how to answer this.

Well, recently
I've been painting.

Oh, I'd love
to show you some.

And of course
I'm always writing.

At the moment I'm writing
a story about an astronaut

who falls in love
with a supernova.

And then I've been
composing songs for years

and working with machines
and gadgets, constructing.

I think of myself
as an atmosphere creator.


Okay, um,
I couldn't help but notice

all the tapes have been not
updated to the new format.

No, I'm old-fashioned.

You know the air sticks became
mandatory seven years ago.

I guess I lost track of time.

(foreboding synthesizer music)

I have to admit there's a lot
more than I was anticipating.

Well, then I better
make us some tea.



(fly buzzing)

Just how many tapes
would you say you have?

2,000 or more?


Perhaps you could
recommend a motel nearby?

Oh, don't be silly.

You'll stay here with me
in Sugarbaby's room.

Oh no, I, I couldn't impose.

Oh, I insist.

Ma'am, I can't stay
in your home.

I, it's, it's fine...
It'll be no bother to me or Sugarbaby.

You just make yourself
at home.

Well, thank you for being so helpful.
I appreciate it.

Of course.
Well, this is gonna be fun.

Come on, Sugarbaby.

Let's let the tax man
do his work, heh.


Arrived at the home of Arabella
Isadora on September 22nd, 2035.

It is now 2:51.

Arabella or Bella as she has
requested I call her has put me

in a spare room
on the second floor.

It appears
she has over 2,000 tapes.

I will begin
my audit immediately.

(mysterious synthesizer music)

(static buzzing)

(plane engine roaring)



(horn blowing)

Woman:
Where did you go?

Man:
I'm right here.

I miss you, Dad.

(buzzing, dings)

Is he gonna die?

Nothing ever dies.

(wound gurgles)

(buzzing, dings)

All things are changing.

(wind hisses)


Oh, this one.

(nostalgic music playing)


(horn blows)

(Preble sighs)


I didn't mean
to startle you.

What are you doing?
I was watching you work.

You were smiling.

Bella, I hate to be rude,
but I prefer to do my work in private.

Of course.
My apologies.

Some dinner
for the tax man.

You don't need to...
(gasps) It's tomato and avocado.

(Preble sighs)


(gentle synthesizer music,
fly buzzing)

Fly: Preble.

Listen to me.

Listen to me, Preble.
You don't have much time.

You're in danger.

They're trying to kill you.

Dream of me.

Dream of me, Preble.

Dream of me.

(music stops)

(eerie piano notes)

(eerie piano notes)

Hello?

(eerie piano notes)

What are you doing down here?

You playing the piano?

(playing "Row, Row,
Row Your Boat" on piano)

(crickets chirping,
music continues)

(music ends)

(fly buzzing,
frantic piano music)

(fly speaking indistinctly)

Whoa, looks like you
got a spider problem.

Well, this stuff
is pretty good.

A couple sprays of this
and you'll be bug-free for sure.

(bottle hissing)

It's fun.

(bottle hissing)

(loud knocking)

I didn't hear anything.

(loud knocking)

Wait. No.

What are you doing?

If you open that door,
you're just gonna let in pain.

I'll get it.

We're not interested.
Thanks.

Woman:
Can I speak to James Preble?

Buddy: (sighs) Look,
he's not accepting visitors at this time.

Woman:
Well, is he here?

Buddy: He's very,
very busy, okay?

But I'll be sure
to tell him you stopped by.

Woman: Please,
I really got to speak to him.

Buddy: Look, James has
everything he needs, okay?

If there's anything new
that he needs,

he can just get it from me.

(door slam echoes)


Who was it?

Forgot I ordered us
some chicken.

Extra crispy, double gravy,
just the way you like it.

Mmmm.

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.

(Buddy laughing)

Come on, help me.
(bottle hissing)

Look at them squirm.

(machine whirring)

(rooster crowing)

(hens clucking)

(Bella imitating hens clucking)

How long have you been
auditing dreams?

I've been with the federal
government for about 15 years now.

And...
do you enjoy it?

Yes, ma'am.
I do enjoy the work.

(brooding synthesizer music)

And are you
enjoying my dreams?

Waiter: And will anyone
be joining you this evening?

No, it'll just be me.

Can I start you
with anything to drink?

Yeah, can I have a glass of wine please?
Oh, sure thing.

Thank you.
And what's your soup of the day?

Today we have
a cream of asparagus.

Ooh, that sounds good.

Oh, madame,
it is delicious.

Oh. You know, you have a very deep voice.
It's nice.

Oh, thank you,
madame.

No, no, I mean it.
You could be on the radio.

I've been told that before.
I bet you can sing.

Well, actually,
I play the saxophone.

(mysterious saxophone music)

(pensive synthesizer music)

(bird chirping)

There's a bird in here.

Yes, madame. We are working
to remedy the situation.

Thank you.

Oh, hello, friend.


Our apologies about the bird.

Here's some (speaking
gibberish) on the house.

Thank you.

Waiter:
Yes, of course.

(eerie music, buzzing)

(customers speaking faintly)

(match striking,
music fades)

(faint pensive music)

(person whistles)

Did you hear that?

It's probably just the pipes.

Do you wanna kiss me?

What?

How do you like the wine?

Um, can you excuse me
just for a second?

(water splashing)

(Preble breathing heavily)

but I should go to bed.

I'm not feeling well.
Oh, well, you should sit down.

I think I drank
too much wine.

Or maybe not enough.

No, no.

Well, at least
sit with me while I finish.

(Preble sighs)

(thunder rumbling)

Looks like there's gonna
be a storm tonight.

I need to see you again.

I think I'm losing my mind.

Well, it's about time.

To losing one's mind.

There's something
I don't understand.

I'm glad to hear that.

There was a bucket
of chicken in your dream,

but I couldn't see it.

Maybe you couldn't see it because
it wasn't supposed to be there.

(somber synthesizer music)

Let me ask you something.

Do you believe that your
dreams are your own?

Of course.

And you don't think
anything should be transmitted

in there against your will?

Of course not.

What are you trying to say?

Jim and I developed
this together.

Once we started wearing this,
the ads disappeared.

What ads?

The ads transmitting into our
dreams without us knowing.

That doesn't happen.

You of all people should know.

Don't you see them in there
when you're doing your work?

That's crazy.
Why would they do that?

Because it makes them money.

(tense synthesizer music)

(music stops)

Thank you for dinner.

(tense mysterious
synthesizer music)

(fly buzzing faintly)

Buddy:
Hey buddy, let me in.

Buddy, let me in.

(loud knocking)

Hey.

Hey, what's going on?

I got a fresh tube here
for you.

Fresh and minty. Sure to keep
your teeth clean all day long.

I just wanna talk.

She told me.

Told you what?

You know she's crazy,
right?

You can't keep me out,
James.

(discordant synthesizer music)

(loud knocking)

James, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

Hey, have a cold one.

(loud whirring,
Buddy groans)

James, don't do it.

You know she's just gonna...

(static buzzing,
speech distorted)

(mysterious synthesizer music)

Hi, Preble.

Man:
Who's that? (echoing)

(thunder rumbling)

(rain falling)

(pensive synthesizer music,
thunder rumbling)

(thunder rumbling)

(fire crackling)

(thunder rumbling faintly)

Does anybody else know?

I'm not sure.

What am I supposed
to do with this?

That's up to you.

Well, then why did you
bring me here?

I wanted someone
to share my dreams with.

I want you
to look at this.

You and I are more
connected than you know.

(thunder rumbling faintly)

(rain falling)

Morning, Bella.

Bella?

(low somber synthesizer music)

Bella?

Bella.

Bella!

I don't know,
she seemed... good.

(speaking faintly)

I used to make
them for my son,

but he was never interested.

You have a son?

Yes.

We don't see
much of each other.

Oh yeah?
Why is that?

We don't see
eye to eye.

I was very young
when Peter was born.

His father and I
went to school together.

He was much older.


(suspenseful synthesizer music)

He was an evil man.

And unfortunately,
Peter took after him in that regard.

If I could go back...

I would do
things differently.

But that's life.

What was your
second husband like?

He was a dream.

We had a wonderful life
together.

(soft nostalgic
synthesizer music)

(doorbell chiming)

Peter: You must be James Preble.
Yes.

Peter Bloom.
Bella was my mother.

Ah yes. Hello.

Terrible thing to lose your mother.
Very sad.

Sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

She was rather old,
so I guess it wasn't terribly surprising.

She was a lovely woman.
Yeah, she was. Listen, James.

I'd like to have a few words with
you about the last couple of days.

To be honest
I think her mind was slipping

these past few years,
or since Jim died.

I hope she didn't fill your
head with any of her nonsense.

You understand she was
totally delusional?

I wasn't aware.

Listen, my wife and son
are arriving this afternoon.

Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight

and we can all talk
and send you on your way.

Okay.
That sounds fine.

Great.

(somber synthesizer music)

(music stops)

(nostalgic synthesizer music)

Grass Man: I've loved you in
many lifetimes, in many forms...

in many places
through many storms.

In the desert,
lost at sea,

with little hope
to comfort me.

But there you were,
all alone,

arm in arm,
we made it home.

(music swells)

(music ends,
loud knocking)

There you are.
Come on down for dinner.

This is my son,
Brian.

Chicken?

Here's Martha.

Martha, dear,
why don't you take Brian

and start going through
Mother's belongings?

(Martha snickers)

So did my mother
ever mention me?

(somber pulsating
synthesizer music)

Um...

just, just once,
briefly.

But I didn't ask her
about her personal life.

I'm just here
doing my job.

You find anything
interesting on the tapes?

She had a very vivid
imagination.

Indeed she did.

So listen, I'm curious
if you don't mind my asking.

What is the protocol
on cases of this nature?

Well, it can be tricky
when someone passes mid-audit.

I personally deal
with the living

so there will be a specialized unit
who comes in and takes over the case.

So your work is complete?

Well, my, my work
is complete,

but the audit
will be finished.

You understand
why someone in my position

needs to make sure
that his family is protected

from unwanted attention?

If you'll excuse me,
I should finish packing.

What are you doing?
Peter: All of these belong to us now.

They're still
part of the audit.

What's wrong
with you people?

Hey, bub.

My mother's dead.

The audit is over.

No, you'll have to square
that away with the Bureau,

but just so you know,
you and your family

have just committed a federal crime and
I'll have no choice but to report it.

(nostalgic synthesizer music)

(music stops,
machine thuds)

(dramatic unsettling
synthesizer music)

Peter:
<i>Hey, bub, bub, bub.</i>

<i>My mother is dead.</i>

<i>This is over.</i>

<i>(distorted voices
speaking faintly)</i>

Peter:
<i>Nonsense.</i>

<i>Listen, my son and wife
are arriving this afternoon.</i>

<i>Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight?</i>

(head squelches)

(Martha cackling)

<i>Why don't we all
have dinner here tonight</i>

<i>and then we can all talk
and send you on your way.</i>

<i>(loud whooshing)</i>

(unsettling discordant music)

(high-pitched
discordant string music)

Uh, excuse me, Peter?

Uh...

You've been a bad boy.

(audio crackling)


(music lowers in intensity)

Excuse me,
I've been a bad boy.

(music swells)

(music stops)

Death to all bad boys.

(loud suspenseful music)

You should watch
where you're going,

you dumb donkey boy.

I'm lost.
My head hurts.


Death to all bad boys.

Martha And Brian:
Death to all bad boys.

Death to all bad boys.

Death to all bad boys.

Bella?

Brian:
Death to all bad boys.

Brian And Martha:
Death to all bad boys.

I'm in trouble.
I know.

Look, first thing's first,
I have to get you out of this closet.

Well, how are you gonna do that?
We're gonna swim.

(Brian sniffing)

Hey, Dad, he's in here.

How are we gonna swim?
Hold your breath.

(Martha cackling)


Now I'm angry.

Open this fucking door!
(banging)


One...

two...


three.

(music stops)

(Preble screaming faintly)


(birds chirping faintly)

Preble, it's okay,
it's okay.

Bella?
Hi, Preble.

(inspirational
synthesizer music)

This island became our home.

We had everything we needed.

<i>Fresh coconut water to drink.</i>

<i>Vegetables from
underneath the sand.</i>

<i>And all the fish
you could ever eat.</i>

(Bella laughing)

<i>We invented games
with seashells and pebbles</i>

<i>and pieces of driftwood.</i>

Oh.

(Bella laughs)

<i>And wrote novels
in the sand.</i>

(dolphin chirping)

<i>For every dolphin in the water,
there was another in the sky.</i>

<i>Anything was possible
on that island.</i>

<i>One morning Bella
turned me into a balloon</i>

<i>and I floated high
above the ocean waves.</i>

<i>Some days we were joined
by an old friend.</i>

<i>Played us some of the smoothest
tunes we'd ever heard.</i>

<i>We danced until
we couldn't dance anymore.</i>

<i>We fell in love.</i>

<i>And one night
we turned into beets...</i>

<i>and had a front row seat to the
first dinner we ever shared.</i>

To our house guest,
Mr. Preble.

(Preble whistles)

Did you hear that?

Preble: <i>Days stretched out in front
of us like diamonds on a necklace.</i>

I don't feel so good.

You're bleeding.

<i>(static)</i>
<i>Fast acting double strength.</i>

These puppies will
take away the pain.

<i>Take away the pain.</i>
<i>(static screeching)</i>

Preble, there's something
I have to tell you.

What?

They're trying to kill you.

Come on, we have to go.

Wait, why are they trying to kill me?
Because of what you know.

What do I know?
You know about the ads.

Do you know who my son is?
No, who is he?

Guavatron industries
is the largest ad agency

in the whole country
and my son's their CEO.

<i>Spider Death,
three times more deadly</i>

<i>than the other leading brands.</i>

Don't look at that.
Come on.

Do you know how they became the
biggest ad agency in the country?

No, how?
Because they put ads in our dreams.

How do you know all this?
<i>Red Rocket soda, one sip...</i>

Because the experiments,
the rats.

Come on Preble,
we have to go.

<i>Cap'n Kelly's
Barnyard Bucket.</i>

<i>Cap'n Kelly's.
Cap'n Kelly's Barnyard Bucket.</i>

<i>Cap'n Kelly's Barnyard Bucket.
One sip.</i>

<i>(drowning each other out)</i>

<i>The pain.
Red Rocket soda.</i>

<i>Fast acting pill.
Six pack.</i>

<i>It's your clucky day.</i>

<i>Try six packs,
ice cold, ice cold.</i>

<i>Try six packs.</i>

<i>(drowning each other out)</i>

Bella. Bella.
(Peter grunts)

Bella. Bella.

What are you doing?

No, no.

No, what are you doing?
Stop.


He's waking up.

Where's Bella?

Who's Bella?


(somber synthesizer music)

Gotta find her.

(music swells)

Gentlemen!
(bell ringing)

Preble:
All hands on deck.

(dramatic inspirational music)

<i>We've been at sea now for seven
years with no sign of Bella.</i>

<i>Despite our fruitless efforts thus
far, I have not given up hope.</i>

<i>For just last week, we found a
stowaway hidden amongst the potatoes.</i>

<i>He spoke of seeing
a woman in a white dress</i>

<i>whispering to a caterpillar
in a grassy meadow.</i>

<i>There's no doubt in my mind
it was Bella.</i>

<i>With this news,
my heart is light.</i>

<i>Richard and I have been playing
Bella's favorite tune before supper.</i>

<i>We end each day
with a prayer for Bella</i>

<i>that she is safe,
wherever she may be.</i>

<i>And we sing late into the night
knowing we will soon find her.</i>

â™ª Hey days and days â™ª

â™ª The endless ocean waves â™ª

â™ª The deep blue sea
is the only life for me â™ª

â™ª Hey... â™ª

Captain,
no sign of Bella.

Keep looking, men.

Captain,
with all due respect,

I don't think we're
ever going to find her.


(discordant string music)

Come on, Peter.
Let's get going.

Go get Brian and wait in the car.
I'll be right down.


Captain, a blue demon!

(dramatic music)

Good lord.

Men, ready the cannons.

Let's show this ungodly beast
what we've got.

(flames crackling)

(eerie music)

Marcus?

Richard?

Captain,
what's our course?

My foot is on fire.

(faint screaming)

Captain,
we have entered the swamp.

(finger tapping)

(voice speaking gibberish)

Captain,
I can't get a good reading.

The compass
is going haywire.

(finger tapping)

(Rat Sailor speaking
gibberish in deep voice)

(Preble speaking gibberish)

(Rat Sailor speaking gibberish)

(chicken clucking)

Ooooh dear.

(eerie music)

(gloves rustling)

(creature grunting faintly)

(high-pitched monotone ringing)

(ringing falls in pitch)

You have to get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you.

(creature speaking gibberish)

<i>(creature speaking
faintly on television)</i>

<i>(static buzzing)</i>

(television thuds)

<i>(news host speaking faintly)</i>

(creature grunting)

(chains clanking)

(nostalgic synthesizer music)

(Bella laughs)

(soft gentle music)

I'm so happy
to be here with you.

Aw.

Were you scared?
Yeah, I was scared.

I wasn't scared.

Yeah you were.

(Preble laughs)

You should've seen your face.
You were terrified.

What was that thing?

What do you have
nightmares about?

You gotta loosen up,
Preble.

I don't wanna
go to your house.

I just wanna stay here,
right here with you.

It can't last.

Why?

Because the house is on fire
and you're gonna die soon.

But...

I'm here.

And you're here.

but once the fire takes over the house,

you won't be.

You have to go back.

(waves crashing)

You're bleeding again.
I know.


You have to turn yourself
into a caterpillar.

What?

Preble, I know
this sounds crazy,

but you need to trust me.

(nostalgic synthesizer music)

There's only one way home.

Preble: <i>So I turned
myself into a caterpillar</i>

<i>and I swam
across the ocean.</i>

<i>And when the ocean turned into a
desert, I crawled.</i>

<i>I crawled through the sand
for decades.</i>

<i>And then the snows came.</i>

<i>A massive snow storm
that lasted for centuries.</i>

<i>And then one day I started to
feel my body coming back to me.</i>

<i>Stinging snow against my face
made it impossible to see.</i>

<i>All the while knowing
that if I didn't make it back,</i>

<i>Bella's secret would die...</i>

<i>and the ads in our dreams
would just grow stronger.</i>

<i>And then I saw it.</i>

I've been looking for you.

I know what you did.

I don't want you here.

That's no way to talk
to an old friend.

You're not my friend.

Really?


I gave you
everything you needed...

everything
you ever wanted.

And you know why?

You don't even know what you
want until I give it to you!

You need me.

And that's never gonna change.
(objects thudding)

Let's go shopping.

(dramatic music)

(suspenseful music)

I can't breathe.

I can't breathe.


(Preble shouting indistinctly)

(music ends)

(pensive synthesizer music)

(fly buzzing)

Fly:
Preble.

Listen to me, Preble.

You don't have much time.

You're in danger.

When you can
no longer breathe,

when you're buried under
everything,

when all hope is lost...

dream of me.

Dream of me, Preble.

Dream of me
and I'll come to you.

Bella.

(dramatic music)


Preble, Preble!

Preble?

Preble?

Preble, Preble,
where are you, Preble?

Preble?

Preble, wake up.

Preble, turn this knob.

Turn it again.


Again, again, again!

(muffled voices
speaking indistinctly)

How many planets have I been?

(static buzzing)

(static crackling)

(bright synthesizer music)

Preble: <i>And then suddenly
everyone I knew was there.</i>

<i>And they were all cheering.</i>

<i>Cheering for us.</i>

<i>But something was wrong.</i>

Peter: Hello, mother.
Peter.

I'm so sorry
about everything.

I love you so,
so, so much.

Preble:
<i>He shouldn't be here.</i>

Hello, Preble.

It's time you go home.

Step right up.
The ride's about to begin.

Ha ha!

Preble: <i>But everyone
was smiling and happy.</i>

<i>Maybe people change.</i>

<i>Maybe things change.</i>


Preble:
What's happening?

We're separating.

He tricked us!

We're disintegrating!

Bella:
No, I don't believe that.

Preble:
I can feel the fire.

It's overtaking me.

Fight it, Preble.
You can fight it.

I can't stop it.

Goodbye, Bella.

I'm melting.

Melting, that's it.

The ice cream cone.

Ice cream cone?
What ice cream cone?



(nostalgic synthesizer music)

(gasps, coughing)

(breathing heavily)

(pensive synthesizer music)

(dramatic music)

(music fades)


(gentle nostalgic music)

I like your song.

Thank you.

Would you like
to go for a walk?

Okay.

Grass Man: I've loved
you in many lifetimes,

in many forms,

in many places
through many storms.

In the desert,
lost at sea,

with little hope
to comfort me.

But there you were,
all alone.

Arm in arm
we made it home.
