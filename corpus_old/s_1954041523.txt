<i>My name is John H. Groberg.</i>

<i>I was born during the Great Depression
in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</i>

<i>My middle name is Holbrook,
which is my mother's maiden name.</i>

<i>Mom and dad gave that
name to all seven boys...</i>

<i>...of which I am the oldest.</i>

<i>We were poor,
but we lived happily...</i>

<i>...on large doses of home made
bread and family music.</i>

<i>My dad was a
real estate appraiser...</i>

<i>...and a prominent Democrat...</i>

<i>...which is to say he was about
the only Democrat in Idaho Falls.</i>

<i>One year President Harry Truman
came to town...</i>

<i>...campaigning for the re-election...</i>

<i>...and my dad was selected
to greet him.</i>

<i>President Truman did very well
among the Groberg clan that year.</i>

<i>I went to school at a little place
called East Side Elementary.</i>

<i>One morning our principal,
Miss Bunker...</i>

<i>...gathered all us kids out front.</i>

<i>She told us something terrible
had just happened...</i>

<i>...at a place called
Hiroshima, Japan...</i>

<i>...and she asked us to observe
a moment of silence.</i>

<i>All I knew about the Japanese
was that we were at war with them.</i>

<i>And yet, standing there
in front of my school...</i>

<i>I felt something for them.</i>

<i>Later in my life...</i>

<i>I would come to feel even more
deeply about another people...</i>

<i>...in a land far away.</i>

Hey!
Hey!

Excuse me!
Come on, guys!

What are you doing? It's me! C'mon!
Sorry!

What are you doing?

Come on!

Go, John!

Come on!

I'll take that!

I can't believe you, John Groberg!

What do you mean? He's my date!
He was your date!

So, what? I suppose come to
the dance by myself just because...

...you're playing in the band? What?

You can come with whomever you
want. As long as you leave with me.

Really?
Really.

Come on, Jean!
I want to show you something.

Come on, follow me!

It's like heaven!

Do you like it?

It's all yours.

I had it made special.

The moon, too.

Get in. I want to show you something.
Alright.

Look in the water and
tell me what you see.

I see the moon.

Look again.

I see...

...me in the moon.

Exactly.
You in the light of the moon.

Do you know how many miles that
light traveled to shine on you?

I guess I don't.

Ninety-two million,
three hundred thousand. Give or take.

And you know what else?
What?

I think you were worth the trip.

Do you know what I think?

What?

I think you think too much.

Maybe I do.

No matter where they send me,
we'll be underneath the same moon.

"You are hereby called
to serve as a missionary...

...to the people of the Kingdom of... "
Tonga!

You're going to Tonga!

Tonga?

Wait a minute!

Where's Tonga?

John, over here!

Speech!
Yeah! Let's hear a speech, Delbert!

Go ahead, dad.
Well, I...

...hadn't really prepared for this.
Don't know how I could have.

All my life I've been taught that God
loved the world so much...

He gave the world His son.

I used to think I knew
what that meant...

I didn't.

I don't know anyone
in Tonga well enough...

...to love them and
send them my son.

But I guess God does.

Keep that in mind during
the hard times, son.

How much God loves His children.
Listen to you, going on...

...like you know something.
All aboard!

I love you, dad.

I love you, too, son.

I love you, mom.

Don't come home, son.

Don't come home early.

Three cheers for John Groberg!

Goodbye! See you!
Goodbye, honey.

<i>"Dear Jean, it's okay you couldn't
make it to the big farewell.</i>

<i>I wouldn't have wanted you
crying and making a fuss.</i>

<i>And if you hadn't cried, well,
that would've been worse.</i>

<i>There were seven of us
missionaries on the boat.</i>

<i>But the others were all continuing
to Australia or New Zealand.</i>

<i>I was supposed to meet the president
of the Samoan mission at the dock...</i>

<i>...and he was going to put me
on another boat to Tonga.</i>

<i>I guess he didn't know I was coming
'cause he didn't show up.</i>

<i>After a couple weeks
I finally found him...</i>

<i>...he put me on a boat to Fiji...</i>

<i>...where he said I could
catch another boat to Tonga.</i>

<i>He also told me there
would be two missionaries...</i>

<i>...waiting for me at the dock. "</i>

Get off me boat, mate!
Your tickey ends here!

Stop right there!
You are not on our list!

Piss on your bleeding list!
The boy gets off!

I will be arresting him!
That's his problem!

Crazy man!
Step off the plank, mate...

...or I'll have to push you!

You are under arrest.

Elder Louie Armstrong?

<i>"The missionaries
in Fiji got me a job...</i>

<i>...on a freighter to Tonga.
I bunked with a guy named Swede...</i>

<i>...who promised me a girl in
every port if I left my mission...</i>

<i>...and stayed on the boat. I told
him one girl was enough for me.</i>

<i>You know, I think he lost a lot
of respect for me when I said that.</i>

<i>When I finally got to Tonga,
it was business as usual.</i>

<i>Nobody knew I was coming.</i>

<i>I guess word got around
that there was a kid from Idaho...</i>

<i>...sitting on the dock, because
suddenly, out of the clear blue... "</i>

Groberg? Elder John Groberg?
Yes, sir.

Where on earth have
you been, young man?

I've prayed long and hard
about your assignment.

I think I have just
the place for you.

Niuatoputapu.
New what?

It's a small island about
eight hundred miles from here.

There is no white people, and
no one speaks a lick of English.

Sounds great.

Well, you have two assignments:

Learn the language
and build a kingdom.

Any questions?
No. I mean, yes.

Who'll be my companion?

Feki!

Feki, I want you to meet your
new companion, elder Groberg.

Welcome, Kolipoki!
I have been praying for you.

<i>"By far the hardest
part of my trip...</i>

<i>...was the eight-day journey
to my assigned island.</i>

<i>The seas were rough
and the boat small.</i>

<i>I got seasick after the first hour and
wished I were dead the entire trip. "</i>

Kolipoki?

Kolipoki, the island is here!
Journey is over. Let's go!

Come on. Come on!

<i>"They call me 'Kolipoki' because...</i>

<i>...they can't pronounce
'Groberg' down here.</i>

<i>Someday I'll probably
find out it actually means...</i>

<i>'white guy with a weak stomach'."</i>

Do you think there'll be
someone there to greet us?

Elder John Groberg. Thank you
so much for coming to greet me.

What is it with them?

What are they saying?

They are saying you are white
and soft. I think they are right.

Come.

What about our greeting party?

The Branch President?

Okay, you wait here.
I'll go and find them.

That...

...is really good.

My tongue! I can't feel my tongue!
It's all right. It's okay.

Tonight we celebrate the arrival...

...of our white brother, Kolipoki...

...who comes as God's messenger
to our tiny island.

He wants to know if you
have any words for them.

I have to go to the bathroom!

He has to relieve his waters.

The palangi has to pee!

I guess they all have to go also.

I'd hate to see what happens
when I take a bath!

Feki?

Feki!

<i>"Dear Jean, I hope all is well with
you back in the United States.</i>

<i>Things are okay here in Tonga.
The island is beautiful...</i>

<i>...but quite small.</i>

<i>Everyone is related to each other,
and the few who might listen to us...</i>

<i>...already belong to another church.</i>

<i>Their minister has warned
them not to listen to me...</i>

<i>...which is kind of pathetic since
I can't speak their language anyway.</i>

<i>My mission president told
me to 'learn the language...</i>

<i>...and build up the church. '</i>

<i>So far I'm not doing
very well at either.</i>

<i>The mail boat comes
just once a month...</i>

<i>...and the only thing I'm looking
forward to more than your letters...</i>

<i>...is the mosquito net my mission
president promised to send.</i>

<i>They have a disease here the
mosquitoes spread, call elephantitis.</i>

<i>Would you still love
me if I came home...</i>

<i>...looking like an elephant?</i>

<i>Enough about poor old me.</i>

<i>Tell me about you.
What are you doing for Christmas?</i>

<i>How did your finals going?</i>

<i>Has Edward asked
you to marry him yet?</i>

<i>If so, please keep in mind
the Tongan missionary...</i>

<i>...who is trying hard to not come
home looking like an elephant.</i>

<i>I love you, you know.</i>

<i>Write to me.</i>

<i>John. "</i>

The Branch President wants you to
speak to the members this Tuesday.

How can I speak
if I don't know the language?

He says we will pray for you.
Very hard.

We will now hear...

...from our palangi brother, Kopoki.

"We will now hear from
elder Kolipoki. "

No matter what he says...

...nod your heads...

...and act interested.

"It will be a great talk. "

I...

I am very grateful...

...to stand before you today.

Ever since I was a little boy...

I have wanted to grow up and serve...

...as one of the Lord's...
one of the Lord's outhouses.

And I suppose...

...that's my message
to each of you today.

Why has the Lord chosen
to send an outhouse...

...all the way from America...

...when each and every one of you...

...is capable of being...

...your own outhouse?

What did I say?

Elder Outhouse!

Did I say that?

Quiet!

Be kind to the elder!
Be kind to the elder!

A boat is coming, Kolipoki.
There will be mail.

Kolipoki!

Mele, where's Kolipoki?

Kolipoki!

Kolipoki...

"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth. "

"And God said, 'Let there be light! '
And there was light!"

"And God saw the light
and it was good. "

"And God divided the light
from the darkness. "

<i>"Dear John...</i>

<i>...this is the fourth letter I've sent
without hearing once from you.</i>

<i>I hope I'll get a whole
batch someday soon.</i>

<i>I also hope and pray
all is well with you.</i>

<i>You remember Edward?</i>

<i>Well, he proposed to me last week.</i>

<i>I told him I'd have to think about it,
that you and I have a deal. "</i>

"When I consider Thy heavens,
the work of Thy fingers... "

<i>"Funny thing is, I don't know
what that deal is. "</i>

"The moon and the stars,
which Thou hast ordained... "

<i>"I went out to our swing to think
about it. The moon was shining...</i>

<i>...and I remembered you saying...</i>

<i>'no matter where we are,
it will shine down on both of us'."</i>

"What is man, that Thou
art mindful of him?"

<i>"I felt close to you
for just a moment...</i>

<i>...as if the heavens connected us.
I miss you, you know.</i>

<i>Across the sky, I miss you. "</i>

Kolipoki!

Kolipoki!
Wake up!

Hey, man!

Where have you been
the last four days?

Kolipoki! You scared me!

I'm hungry enough
to eat three pigs!

Roasted or boiled?

You kill it, I'll swill it.

Kolipoki, how well you speak!

Come. Let's go to work.

Let the good times roll!

<i>"Dear Jean, I've made
progress with the language...</i>

<i>...and the work is going much better.</i>

<i>We are teaching a young man
named Finau...</i>

<i>...who is very excited
about the Gospel.</i>

<i>He would already be baptized,
but his parents won't allow it.</i>

<i>He and several villagers
helped us build our own house.</i>

<i>It was a lot of work...</i>

<i>...but the hardest part was evicting
the previous occupants. "</i>

There you go! We got it!
How about that?

Home, sweet home.

It's the cry of death.

Someone has died. They mourn
his passing with their cries.

Of all God's creations,
His children are His greatest glory.

Fifita!
Get off!

Is the pudding ready?

A professional mourner?
Yes.

How does she get paid?
A place to stay. Food to eat.

You know, the best gift you can
bring to a Tongan funeral...

...is a sack of flour or a fat pig.

So, Feki, why are you so?

Why do you have such faith in me?

Why shouldn't I?

You traveled so far to teach us,
what you say must be true.

Yeah, but what if I lied to you?
You wouldn't lie, Kolipoki.

But what if I did?

Then you've come a long
way just to tell a lie.

When I was a boy,
my father was a drinking man.

He used to beat my mother.

I wasn't strong enough
to keep him off her.

But the missionaries, they came
and they showed him the truth.

Only the truth was strong enough.

One day I went to thank
them for their sacrifice.

And they just shook
their heads and told me...

...of other missionaries
who sacrificed much more.

They were sick
to death with the fever.

As they left their
families behind...

...and crossed the sea
to preach God's word.

They stood up in their wagons
and shouted: "Hurrah for Israel!"

Every time I see
my father after that...

...every time he wasn't drinking,
I think the same thing:

"Hurrah for Israel!"

I think the same thing every
time I hear you teaching.

Hurrah?
Hurrah!

Hurrah for Israel!
Hurrah for Israel!

Hurrah!
Hurrah!

Kolipoki!

Kolipoki!
Kolipoki!

He fell from a mango tree
and hit his head on the roots.

Take him.

Bless him.
Bring him back to me.

He's dead.

Whether he is dead
or not, I do not know.

What I know is
I want him well again.

And you have the power to do it.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good!

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

<i>The day is past and gone...</i>

<i>The shadows...</i>

<i>Of the evening fall...</i>

<i>The night is coming on...</i>

<i>Within my heart a welcome guest...</i>

<i>Within my home abide.</i>

<i>Savior, stay this night with me...</i>

<i>Behold, 'tis eventide...</i>

<i>Savior...</i>

<i>Stay this night with me...</i>

<i>Behold, 'tis eventide...</i>

Where am I?

Here is your son.
He is alright.

Thank you, Kolipoki!

I knew you'd do it!
I didn't do it.

Papa!

My son!

<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

<i>...much has happened
on our little island.</i>

<i>Feki and I helped
God heal a little boy...</i>

<i>...and the whole island
seems to be aware of it.</i>

<i>I have a feeling we are going
to be more accepted now.</i>

<i>We are teaching
a beautiful new family...</i>

<i>...and are still working with Finau.</i>

<i>Our last lesson was
on the meaning of faith. "</i>

Like the oyster. Things which
are not seen, but which are truth.

<i>"I give him a pearl
as part of the lesson. "</i>

I understand.

<i>"Besides the language,
you will be happy to know...</i>

<i>I am working very hard
on my burping.</i>

<i>It's good manners here to belch
after someone feeds you a meal.</i>

<i>To think that all those years
I thought I was being rude.</i>

<i>So, Edward proposed to you.
Surprise, surprise!</i>

<i>Thanks for telling him
we have a deal.</i>

<i>As far as I am concerned, that deal is
you will be madly in love with me...</i>

<i>...two and a half years from now
when I return from my mission...</i>

<i>...we will be married and
live happily ever after.</i>

<i>Seriously, Jean...</i>

<i>I think this island is the most
beautiful place on earth.</i>

<i>And the only thing that could make it
lovelier would be your presence here.</i>

<i>Someday I hope we can
walk these sands together.</i>

<i>Until then, I love you.
John. "</i>

What is it?
My feet.

Did you sleep
with your feet uncovered?

I don't remember. It was hot!

I told you never to sleep
with your feet uncovered!

The rats, they come and eat
the soles off your feet!

What?
Sit down.

Wait here!

Sure! I'll just wait right
here and bleed to death?

What?

Your feet will have to be seared.

We can use a
hot knife, or the sun.

Over here,
where the sun is strongest.

<i>"Dear John, I am glad
to hear all is well with you.</i>

<i>Thank you for sharing your
version of our deal with me.</i>

<i>As for my version of our deal...</i>

<i>...well, I'm not sure I see things
as clearly as you do.</i>

<i>But I did tell Edward no.</i>

<i>He was pretty upset.</i>

<i>And he came back a week
later and proposed to me again.</i>

<i>I told him I'd have
to think about it again.</i>

<i>It's hard to have so much faith
in us when you're so far away.</i>

<i>What if I catch elephantitis
when you're gone?</i>

<i>Or what if I say no to every
suitor that comes my way...</i>

<i>...and you come home in love
with a Tongan princess?</i>

<i>Anyway, you shouldn't be
thinking of me right now.</i>

<i>You should be thinking
of the people of Tonga.</i>

<i>You should be serving them
with all of your heart...</i>

<i>...and reserving only
the tiniest corner of it for me.</i>

<i>I think I love you.</i>

<i>I think I'll tell Edward 'no'.</i>

<i>If not, I'll definitely
invite you to the wedding.</i>

<i>Love, Jean. "</i>

Asi?
Yes, Kolipoki?

Your daughter, Mele...

...why is she so quiet?

She is not my daughter.

Her mother was a bad woman
that ran around with my husband...

...before he was baptized.

I have taken her as my
own and tried to love her.

But an island is a small
place to escape one's heritage.

She punishes herself
for the sins of her father.

Kolipoki, the minister
has told his people...

...your feet are God's punishment...

...for preaching the false doctrine.
You must show your faith now.

Pray for your feet.

In three days time,
we will prove them wrong.

<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

<i>I think I've finally found the way to
keep Edward from being so hot to trot.</i>

<i>Please send him on
the next boat to Tonga.</i>

<i>I've got just the
treatment for him. "</i>

Today we would like to teach you
about God's plan of happiness.

What?
What's wrong?

Our minister told us
to stop taking your lessons.

I see.
But it is okay...

...if we keep feeding you.

Shouldn't we bless it first?

Okay if I say it?

Dear Father in Heaven, we thank Thee
this day for this wonderful family.

We thank Thee for all our blessings.

Especially for...

Thy marvelous plan of
happiness for Thy children.

We thank thee for Thy son,
Jesus Christ...

...who lived and died that someday we
might return to live with Thee again.

We thank Thee for
the knowledge that...

...through Thy plan of happiness...

...our families can
live together forever.

We are grateful for Thy
wonderful plan of happiness...

...and for this wonderful family...

...that has prepared us
this wonderful meal.

In the name of Jesus Christ,
Amen.

Amen.
Amen.

Please pass the octopus.
That was a lovely prayer, Kolipoki.

Next time, I'll say it.

Thank you for dinner.

At least I know one
of you enjoyed it.

Very good, Kolipoki!
Better late than never, huh?

Leave the mormons to me!

Hey, Tomasi!

Why did you help us?

Many years ago,
I was an orphan on the big island.

Missionaries like you
took care of me...

...and put me in school.
They were kind to me.

Then I moved here,
there were no missionaries...

...so I forgot about the Church.

Until tonight.

When the minister asked
us to rough up the Mormons...

I remembered something:
I am one.

To Tomasi, the Mormon.

Ready?
Set...

...go!

Come on, slowpoke!

Who wants to go on a picnic?

To the backside!

Noli!

Help me, Elder!

I hurt my ankle!

Oh, boy.
This would never happen in Idaho!

Come with me!
Lavania!

Lavania, we can't do this.

But I thought you liked me.
No, I do like you.

Then how can you reject me?

Am I not pretty enough?

You're plenty pretty.

Then come!
Let's make love!

Come with me to the beach
and we can talk of love.

A kind that never ends.

We will talk of love?
Yeah! True love.

More than this.
Wait! Wait for me!

<i>"Dear John, I went on a picnic
yesterday with Edward.</i>

<i>He tried to get all mushy.</i>

<i>You are so lucky you don't have
to worry about stuff like that!"</i>

Tomasi!

Tomasi, we're here
to take you to church.

The Mormons.

You come to baptize me?

Yeah, sort of.

The pudding is all gone.

Yes. I noticed.
Well, then?

What's wrong, Noli?
What's bothering you?

You say you love us and
are trying to help us.

But you think you're too
good for my daughter.

Isn't she pretty enough for you?

Your daughter is very beautiful.

My husband offers you
hundreds of acres of our best land!

We offer you our daughter.

And still you turn up
your nose at us.

What do you want anyway?

Well, I guess...
I'll make you a better offer.

You don't even have to marry our
daughter or live on our island.

Just give us half-white baby
and we will not say anymore.

Surely you cannot be so selfish
as to not do that for us!

Well, it's not really a matter of...
What is it then?

Our brown skin?
I love your brown skin!

Are you too rich to share your
seed with poor people like us?

My seed?

It's not that simple...
It's not that complicated either!

I cannot share my seed
until I am married...

...and I cannot be married until
I'm no longer a missionary.

Take a day off then!

There is not a man on this island
who would not sell all he owns...

...to spend one hour with my daughter!

Yes. Yes!

And for that precise reason...

...she should save herself, that
most beautiful part of herself...

...for that man who
will love her forever!

Here.
Look at this.

This is a picture of my true love.

We want to be married
for eternity when I return.

So we promised we will save that
part of ourselves for each other.

See how beautiful she is?
She is very beautiful.

She is keeping
her promise to me.

Do you think that I should
break my promise to her?

Kolipoki, you must
keep your promise.

Go now.
Thank you for telling me.

I will not bother you anymore.

Fish for breakfast!
Just like I promised you.

Finau!
We're coming!

Get your hands off him!

Come on! Come on!

A beautiful, white boat!
From New Zealand!

It's a boat!

We only got room for three.

Please, these men
have nothing you need!

Vanela, come back!
No, my child! No!

Please, no more!

These men take all and
give nothing in return.

Oh my God!
No! Please!

Dear God in Heaven!

Mele? Mele! Please,
don't do this thing, Mele!

I've been where you're going!
It's a place of darkness!

Please!
For God's sake, old man!

Mele, please forgive me my sins
and live a life better than me!

Mele!

Mele!

Lavania Sofili Nihau...

...having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ...

I baptize you,
in the name of the Father...

...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

Amen.

Amen.

The missionaries, my son.
They are here. It is what you wanted.

He has a lockjaw.
We can give him a blessing.

There will be none of
your blessings in this house!

The boy is dying!
It could only help!

I... See a light!

A light? You see a light?

Go to it, Finau!
Greet the light!

It comes to me...

We must go now.

We just got here.
The air grows heavy.

It's always heavy.
Not like this.

We must find a place to hide.
Hide?

We must go now!

Feki!

Come!

Hold on!

My girl!
I gotta find my girl!

Lita! Lita!

Look out!

Lita! Lita!

Where are you?

Lita!

Where are you?

Lita!

Lita!

Lita!

Lita!

Lita!

There she is!

Lita, let's go!

Come on, Lita!
Let's go.

Hurry!

Come on, Feki!
Let's go!

Hurry!
Let's go!

Hurry!
Don't stop!

Look out!

C'mon, get in! Get in!

Lita!
Papa!

Mele.

We have been through this before
and we can make it again.

Harvest all the fruits
from the fallen trees...

...and get all the fruit crops
from out of the ground.

What about the telegraph?
Broken in the storm.

But a boat should
be along in two weeks.

If we ration our food for four,
we will be alright.

Minister, could you please
lead us in prayer?

Certainly.

Dear Father,
our Father in Heaven.

We come before You
on our little island...

...and pray that You
will show us mercy.

We are small but we
are strong, and we love You.

We are thankful so many
of us have survived...

...this great storm.

Father, we know that the
storm rages on elsewhere...

...and we pray for those in its path.

Particularly those who might
be tossed on the waves of the sea.

Please care for them as
You have cared for us.

Amen.

A body washed up!
You must come! Quickly!

Mele.

Dear God, Mele!

...in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
Amen.

I cut, you choose.

Come on,
you took the smaller half!

I am the smaller person.

You want some?
No, thanks.

You really think the boat
will be here in two weeks?

I don't know, Kolipoki.
I don't know.

Still no boat in sight.
And no fish either.

The water in the lagoon
is still bad.

Ready for lunch?
Sure.

It's better to have little
than to have none.

<i>"Dear John...</i>

<i>...it's been six weeks since
your last letter and...</i>

<i>...as much as I hate to admit it,
you've got me worried.</i>

<i>After all you've told
me about Feki, though...</i>

<i>I know you are in good hands.</i>

<i>I hope he's taking
good care of you. "</i>

<i>"Dear Jean, I don't know if I will

the one in which we live.</i>

<i>It's beautiful there...</i>

<i>...and my visits reassure me
that, whether I live or die...</i>

<i>...it doesn't matter much.</i>

<i>Funny as it may sound, my only regret
is not having you here with me.</i>

<i>I would die with your hand
in mind, clasped tightly...</i>

<i>...to make it clear:
We will not be separated!</i>

<i>Assuming, of course, you haven't
married Edward already.</i>

<i>Jean, I've learned things
in the last few weeks...</i>

<i>...that are difficult to express.</i>

<i>There is a connection
between heaven and earth.</i>

<i>Finding that connection makes
everything meaningful...</i>

<i>...including death.</i>

<i>Missing it makes
everything meaningless...</i>

<i>...including life.</i>

<i>Please do all you can
to comfort mom and dad.</i>

<i>I am only now beginning to understand
the love of a parent for a child. "</i>

<i>"Dear John...</i>

<i>...it's been three months since your
parents or I have heard from you.</i>

<i>Are you alright?"</i>

What do you see?
I see...

I see a light!

Go to it, John! Greet the light!

It comes to me.

Kolipoki?

I want you to have this.

I am old and must soon die.

This storm has hurt me.

But you are young and
can yet do much good.

Please, eat my jam and live.

And please forgive me
my trespasses against you.

I didn't know you.

I was afraid.

Of all God's creations...

His children are
His greatest glory...

...and you serve God's children...

...with all your heart.

Kolipoki, Kolipoki.

There is a boat. We are saved.
Let's go.

You go ahead.
I'll stay here.

I will go and bring you back food!

We have a new mission president!

Yes?
Yeah. He...

...wants me to be district president.

He wants to start a school and to
start preaching in the outer islands.

He wants me to call
two counselors...

...and for you...

To go back to construction?

Goodbye.

It is hard to leave a brother.

Yes. Very hard.

I have a gift for you.

Finau's pearl.

You must keep it
to remember him by.

You must keep it
to remember me!

No, it's enough that I remember
you offered it to me.

I must go now, Kolipoki.

I will build all your chapels.

You will fill them, Kolipoki.

Hurrah for Israel!

Hurrah for Israel!

For Israel!

Hurrah!

So, why do I keep hearing
about stolen coconuts?

Girls? Immorality?

You are my counselors.
Counsel with me.

They are the privileges
of the upper class.

Privileges?
What privileges?

Your neighbor's coconuts...

Neighbor's wife.
Not within the Church!

It is the way things
are done here.

I am a copra farmer.

In order to feed my family,
I need my copra...

...to be given the highest prices.
To be sure this is so...

I take my daughter to visit
the governor once a week.

That is, before I met you
and repented.

Now he gives him
a bottle of fine liquor.

You give him liquor?
Every Friday. For the weekend.

Tomasi, you know
that is against our religion.

Drinking liquor
is against our religion.

Giving it... is an act of charity.

Yeah? Well, I forbid you
from doing it again.

You what?
I said...

I forbid you from giving alcohol again.

You are my counselor!
I need you to set a better example.

Tomasi, where are you going?
We have a trip tomorrow!

You just don't understand, Kolipoki.

I must set a better example.

Go! That's it!

I have been thinking...

...you prayed for a tailwind.

Perhaps there are others at sea
praying for a headwind.

We should make it possible
for God to bless both...

...by praying only for a good wind.

We'll each say our own.

Get in.

To make it by sundown,
we must go now.

Make it where?

There is a family that
wants to hear the Gospel.

We have an errand from the Lord.
Get in.

Stay the night there.
We will have wind by the morning.

Take this with you.

Why are you doing this?

I didn't decide to serve the
Lord until I was old and tired.

Tired from all the sin.

You, you are young and
already gave your life to Him.

I cannot be young again...

...but today,
I can be the Lord's wind.

Mama! Mama!
They're here!

They came!
I saw them coming!

<i>"Dear John...</i>

<i>...the islands, the people
there sound wondrous.</i>

<i>You sound wondrous, too.</i>

<i>I can almost feel you stretching.</i>

<i>It is hard to imagine
how I could possibly keep up. "</i>

<i>"You don't need to keep up.
You just need to be you. "</i>

<i>"I'm getting ready to graduate.</i>

<i>I'll probably end up
teaching school somewhere. "</i>

<i>"I wish you could
teach school here.</i>

<i>Can you hear them, Jean...</i>

<i>...can you hear the
children singing?"</i>

<i>"All my love to you. "</i>

Kolipoki! Elder!
Your president is here!

Hello!

You must be the new president.

I didn't expect you.
I'm on my way to Vava'u.

Our boat stops here for the night.

So, pleased to meet you.

Will you be staying here?
No, I have a room down in the village.

I haven't heard much from you.

I was hoping you could give me
a report on your activities.

Certainly, certainly...

Well, I believe we're doing
what you asked.

The school is growing...

...we're traveling to the outer islands,
preaching and baptizing.

Who have you baptized?

Well, we baptized Vika, Hale, Pita...
I have no records of them, nor do I...

...have any reports of your work here.
There's been lots of work.

I didn't know...
When you baptize someone...

...you are supposed to fill out
a baptismal record.

You are also supposed to send weekly
reports telling me what you've done.

For all I know, you could have been
vacationing here for the last two years!

Well, no one ever asked
me about any reports...

...except the branch
president in Felemea...

We don't have a branch in Felemea!

Yes, we have a good, strong
branch of thirty-two members.

And a nice chapel, too.

Who authorized you to organize
a branch in Felemea?

Who authorized you
to build a chapel?

Well, it's just that we've been
baptizing so many people...

Where did you get the money?
Whose land is it built on?

I don't know whose property it's built
on, but everyone in Felemea knows...

Everyone in Felemea,
but no one in my office!

Elder Groberg, the house of
the Lord is a house of order.

There are forms for these things.
Forms?

Which one?

President!

President Stone!

These are the baptisms,
the priesthood ordinations...

...the branches we've organized
and the chapels we've built.

I'm really sorry that
I didn't know about the forms.

Elder Groberg...

I've been up all night worrying
about what I said...

...yesterday.
Looks like you have been, too.

I've never seen a happier bunch
of Saints anywhere on earth.

You just keep doing
what you're doing.

Another thing. I would like
to extend your mission six months.

Sounds great!

I'll be putting two new chapels
into your district.

Seeing as they're going
to be made of concrete...

...you probably should
purchase the land.

Okay!

Kuli, we have a visitor!

It is wrong to stow away!
Yes!

Now, swim home
and hurry up about it!

Okay.

You know, my parents left me
once at a gas station.

We're just driving
around the block, right?

How will he learn if I give in?

Kuli, what about sharks?
Leg cramps?

He is my son.
He will be alright.

Get the sail!
Get the sail now!

I got it!

Help me pull!
Help me pull it!

Stay there, Kolipoki!

Kuli!
Get the sail, Tomasi!

Kuli!

Kolipoki!
Hold on, Kolipoki!

Kuli!

Tomasi!

<i>"Dear John, I am thrilled to hear
about your new assignment...</i>

<i>...although I'm sure it is
sometimes overwhelming.</i>

<i>I felt that way
when I finished school...</i>

<i>...and took my first job
down here in Anaheim.</i>

<i>My friends are all back in Utah,
my family in North Hollywood.</i>

<i>Here I have only my students
and lots of time to think of you.</i>

<i>Are you well, John?
Are you safe?</i>

<i>Do you have time
to think of me...</i>

<i>...or are you completely
lost in the Lord's work?</i>

<i>The Scriptures say you find
your life by losing it...</i>

<i>...and as much as I miss you...</i>

<i>I encourage you on in that quest.</i>

<i>Lose yourself, John,
every last bit of yourself.</i>

<i>Then, when you come home...</i>

<i>I'll know I'm in love with the
version of you God intended. "</i>

He's over there!

Hey, Kuli!

Kolipoki, over here!
Over here!

Swim, Kolipoki!

Kolipoki!

Kolipoki!

This is no place for resting.

Sometimes God calms the storm.
Sometimes He calms the sailor.

Sometimes, He just lets us swim.

I am so sorry, Kolipoki!

Something for me?

You want to tell me what it says?
I don't know.

It's confidential.

<i>"Dear Elder Groberg. Stop.</i>

<i>Request for extension
denied by Salt Lake. Stop.</i>

<i>Boat to New Zealand...</i>

<i>...airplane to Los Angeles,
next week. Stop.</i>

<i>Leave island as soon
as possible. Stop. "</i>

Thank you for the school, Kolipoki.
You're welcome.

Thank you for behaving.
Yes.

We have you a gift
for you, Kolipoki.

Burial clothes?
From Salt Lake.

They asked us to keep them with
you at all times but not tell you.

We are happy we did
not need to use them.

Thank you.
So am I.

We have another surprise
for you, Kolipoki.

<i>A firey horse with the speed of light.
A cloud of dust and a hearty.</i>

<i>Hi-o Silver!
The Lone Ranger!</i>

<i>Return to those thrilling days of
yesteryear. From out of the past...</i>

<i>"Dear John...</i>

<i>...I wish... "
"... You could see what... "</i>

"... I see. "

Tomasi.
You took care of me.

<i>God be with you
till we meet again...</i>

<i>By His counsels guide
uphold you...</i>

<i>With His sheep...</i>

<i>Securely fold you...</i>

<i>- God be with you till we meet again
Your body may leave us...</i>

...but your spirit will always
remain on our island.

Thanks.

Aloha.

Goodbye, Kolipoki.

How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet...

Remember: True love.

Eternal love.
That's right.

<i>God be with you till we meet again...</i>

<i>Keep love's banner
floating o'er you...</i>

<i>Smite death's threatening
wave before you...</i>

<i>God be with you
till we meet again...</i>

<i>Till we meet...</i>

<i>Till we meet...</i>

<i>Till we meet at Jesus' feet...</i>

<i>Till we meet...</i>

<i>Till we meet...</i>

<i>God be with you till we meet again...</i>

<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

<i>...it finally happened.
I am coming home. "</i>

President Stone!
Elder Groberg!

<i>"Funny, though...</i>

<i>It feels more like
I'm leaving home.</i>

<i>For the past three years
I've lived among...</i>

<i>...people who possess nothing...</i>

<i>...yet possess everything. "</i>

John!

<i>"In this life they sail the oceans.
In the next they will sail the skies.</i>

<i>I wish to be more like them:
A boatman among the stars.</i>

<i>And I wish to have you with me,
your softness at my side.</i>

<i>Jean... Jean, Jean...</i>

<i>Will you love me across the sky?"</i>

Get back here!

I'm gonna catch you!

You gotta be faster than that!
