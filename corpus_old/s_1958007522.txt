<i>It all started</i>
<i>with the breakup.</i>

<i>First from one person,</i>

<i>and then from</i>
<i>the rest of society.</i>

<i>I should say now,</i>
<i>I never meant</i>

<i>for any of this to happen.</i>

<i>What eventually became of me</i>

<i>was not what</i>
<i>I had set out to become.</i>

<i>I wanted what any of us want,</i>

<i>to make a difference</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

<i>To love and be loved.</i>

<i>Possibly to rescue a dog.</i>

<i>Maybe I was just trying</i>
<i>to make sense of</i>

<i>this crazy world of ours,</i>

<i>which is impossible.</i>

<i>Our universe consists</i>
<i>of patterns so complex,</i>

<i>it's impossible to know</i>
<i>what you're missing,</i>

<i>let alone where to look.</i>

<i>How can you explain something</i>
<i>you don't truly understand?</i>

<i>Wait.</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Don't you see,</i>
<i>Ashley?</i>

<i>I am setting you free.</i>

<i>The cult was founded in</i>

<i>the spirit of social</i>
<i>consciousness,</i>

<i>as its doctrine included</i>
<i>largely vegetarian diets</i>

<i>and a ban on social traditions</i>

<i>deemed inauthentic</i>
<i>by the cult's leader.</i>

<i>A ban that</i>
<i>was strictly enforced.</i>

<i>Little did they know, however,</i>

<i>this was their fearless</i>
<i>leader's last night on Earth.</i>

Ooh!

God, why do you
keep doing that?

-'Cause it's funny.
-Ugh, if it was funny,

-I would laugh.
-I'm laughing.

I don't laugh like that.

Oh, you absolutely
laugh like that.

You know, for somebody who's
so hypersensitive to others,

your lack of self-awareness
is shocking, Scout.

Scout?

Scout, please. I--

Ooh!

I hate you.
No!

Fear releases dopamine,

which simulates the feeling
of falling in love,

a feeling which doubles down

when you finally realize
you're safe.

So, technically,
like, you're welcome.

Nope. Mm-mmm.

-What about, like, uh--
-Mm-mmm.

Okay. Fine.

What are you tweeting?

Politics.

Oh, what-- what politics?

You hate politics.

No, I don't.
I care a lot about politics.

What kind of politics?

Fine. Mitch McConnell's pushing

a confirmation in
the Ninth Circuit,

but HuffPost just
released a dossier th...

Sorry, I just fell asleep.
Just got bored listening

to all that horse race politics.
It's like, zoom out.

It has nothing to do with
the bigger picture,

which is arguably
much more important.

Do you even know
what horse race politics is?

Or are you just repeating
something that

you heard in a podcast?

Repeating something
I heard off a podcast.

Yeah.

Whi-- which is like
a verbal retweet.

It's the same concept,
basically.

Okay. Fine, true.

You're right. I'm sorry.

I love you.

Hmm.

Psst, your line is,
"I love you, too, Natasha."

Any time.

Right. It's just love is like

an incredibly powerful
human emotion.

And it feels, like,
reductive to limit it

to call and response.

You know,
it's like, "Marco," "Polo."

-"I love you." "Polo."
-I love you, too.

You know what I do love,
though?

Popcorn.

I'm gonna make some.
I'll be back.

Please don't eat in bed, Scout.

I can tell when you do,
'cause there's crumbs.

I'm serious. It wakes me up.

Scout, are you even listening?

Polo.

You were so scared.

You were like, "Ah!"

Do you ever hate people so much

that you find yourself
rooting for global warming?

Wake me up for the revolution.

L-O-L.

<i>Okay. I'm in a parking lot.</i>

<i>A security guard approaches,</i>
<i>nervously.</i>

<i>He's new to the job.</i>

<i>Probably because the job</i>
<i>didn't exist before.</i>

<i>I miss my cousin.</i>

<i>You know, I'd do anything</i>
<i>to get him back.</i>

<i>Anything?</i>

<i>This is a telecom worldwide</i>

<i>prepaid phone call from--</i>

<i>What happened</i>
<i>to Dante Emilio Goochman?</i>

<i>His keys were found</i>
<i>behind the club.</i>

<i>Shots weren't all</i>
<i>that was fired that night.</i>

<i>It sounded like a Taser or,</i>

<i>I don't know, like,</i>
<i>one of those, um...</i>

<i>- A Taser?</i>
<i>- From WLEZ.</i>

<i>This is Justice Al Dante.</i>

<i>Episode 1:</i>
<i>Saturdays Are for the--</i>

<i>Episode 22:</i>
<i>Dude, Where's My Bro?</i>

<i>We still don't know</i>
<i>what happened to Dante.</i>

Good morning, my love.

<i>-What we do know...</i>
-Natasha?

<i>... is the more you know,</i>

<i>the more you don't know.</i>

Natasha?

"I can't do this anymore.
I'm leaving. Natasha."

Very funny, Natasha.

Good-- good joke.

Natasha?

"P.S. This is not a joke.

It if was meant to be funny,
I'd laugh.

And the fact that you probably
are laughing right now

is even more evidence
that we were

never compatible
in the first place.

And furthermore,
evidence that--"

Oh, my God.

She's gone.

Natasha?

<i>Echoes of you ripple</i>
<i>through the sheets.</i>

<i>The concave crease</i>
<i>of something heavy,</i>

<i>recently removed.</i>

<i>Where once were love crumbs,</i>

<i>now are only Doritos.</i>

<i>Day one, I am empty.</i>

<i>â™ª Wake up in the morning</i>
<i>and my bed is empty â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feeling kind of crazy</i>
<i>and I don't know why â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Up in the morning</i>
<i>still dreaming of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm like, fuck that bitch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck that bitch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Wake up but today â™ª</i>

<i>â™ªI'm crying and I can't stop â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Up and I stay</i>
<i>in the shadow of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The places where you</i>
<i>criticized everything I did â™ª</i>

<i>-â™ª Wait, fuck that bitch â™ª</i>
<i>-â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>-â™ª Fuck that bitch â™ª</i>
<i>-â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's no one</i>
<i>to remind me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not to have a beer</i>
<i>for breakfast â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone from me</i>
<i>I can drink two â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Two for me</i>
<i>and none for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that</i>
<i>you're gone from me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can masturbate</i>
<i>any time I want to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone from me</i>
<i>I don't need you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now I'm drunk in the day,</i>
<i>feeling higher than hell â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Turn it up 'cause today</i>
<i>is not about you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The only thing</i>
<i>you took from me â™ª</i>

<i>-â™ª Was pointless negativity â™ª</i>
<i>-â™ª Fuck that bitch â™ª</i>

And furniture. You--
you took all the furniture.

<i>â™ª Used to fight every day</i>
<i>then at night turn away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was fucked up</i>
<i>but not fucking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your nightguard</i>
<i>was disgusting â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Freedom felt from knowing</i>
<i>I will not have to apologize â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For what you overanalyze â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck that bitch, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª So glad you're gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can get some crumbs</i>
<i>up in my bed if I want to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that you're gone from me</i>
<i>I can sleep in shoes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Give me shoes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now that</i>

<i>-â™ª Finally gone â™ª</i>
<i>-â™ª I can have sex â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With any girl I want to â™ª</i>

<i>you're gone from me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can do you</i>

<i>-â™ª And you and you and you â™ª</i>
-Not you.

<i>â™ª Sometimes when</i>

<i>â™ª You're blinded by</i>

<i>â™ª And you fail to realize â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You have landed</i>

<i>â™ª I will be the one for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm glad you're gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your parents</i>

<i>â™ª Why'd you always have</i>

A full-blownm 100%--

Nope, you're just a dick.
You're a dick.

You're a dick,
tucked into an asshole,

tucked into another dick.
You're a-- you're a--

You're a turdicken. Oh, my God.

You're a turdicken.
You invented--

You invented
a new insult for humanity.

By the layers of dick
in your-- in your--

in your-- in your ego...

At least now I have nothing
left to lose.

TouchÃ©.

Ugh, why, what the--

<i>â™ª Abundance is for everyone â™ª</i>

<i>A lot of people,</i>
<i>especially living in L.A.,</i>

<i>are going to say that, like,</i>
<i>self-love, it's all the rage.</i>

<i>We love it.</i>
<i>We all love self-love.</i>

<i>But, like, let's be honest,</i>
<i>it's not some woo-woo shit.</i>

<i>It is some scientific fact.</i>

<i>Wherever you are in life</i>

<i>The other day,</i>
<i>I was on a jog in the park</i>

<i>and I passed by a couple</i>
<i>taking wedding photos.</i>

<i>Everything about</i>
<i>them disagreed.</i>

<i>Their body language,</i>
<i>the tone of their speech.</i>

<i>At one point,</i>
<i>the groom put his hand on</i>

<i>the bride's shoulder</i>
<i>and she winced.</i>

<i>The relationship was</i>
<i>the definition of toxic.</i>

<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>was able to leave.</i>

<i>That's what makes it</i>
<i>a relationship.</i>

<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

<i>In 1920, Italian designer,</i>
<i>Thayat, published</i>

<i>a sewing pattern</i>
<i>for a garment he called</i>

<i>the most innovative,</i>

<i>futuristic garment</i>
<i>ever produced.</i>

<i>What we now call the jumpsuit.</i>

<i>He called it the TuTa.</i>

<i>â™ª Our Big Mac is the biggest â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Our nation is</i>

<i>â™ª Tax cuts for the richest â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Brexit,</i>
<i>wait, that's British â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª America, the bigliest â™ª</i>

<i>More than just an outfit,</i>

<i>the TuTa was designed</i>
<i>as a revolutionary garment</i>

<i>for the new man,</i>
<i>a democratic uniform,</i>

<i>the end of wasteful couture.</i>

<i>It's a bold move, creating</i>
<i>something that will make</i>

<i>your entire industry obsolete.</i>

<i>But that's just what</i>
<i>Thayat set out to do.</i>

<i>Set fire to a relationship</i>
<i>he knew had grown toxic.</i>

<i>So, what happened next?</i>
<i>Revolution in the streets?</i>

<i>Not exactly.</i>

<i>The upper class took on</i>
<i>jumpsuits as an ironic trend.</i>

<i>That's capitalism</i>
<i>for you, baby.</i>

<i>If it ain't broke,</i>
<i>don't fix it.</i>

<i>But if it is broken, do.</i>

<i>America is in</i>

<i>This podcast is brought to you</i>

<i>by Yummy Yummy Chef Time.</i>
<i>That's Yummy Yummy Chef Time.</i>

<i>The time is right for yum.</i>

Oh, God.

Right there. Right there.

I call
this first official meeting

for the sovereign nation state
of Scoutopia to order.

Uh, rollcall first.
Uh, Scout, present, Doge?

Great, that's a quorum.

Uh, next order of business,
we need to elect

a benevolent dictator.

Because, Doge,
benevolent dictator's

the most effective
form of government,

otherwise we could end up,
like, mired in debate.

And the whole point of
Scoutopia is to take action.

If it doesn't make sense,
it's time to make change.

Yeah, I did hear that
on a podcast.

Obviously.

I'll throw out
a nomination on the floor.

Scout Durwood for the role
of benevolent dict-- dictator.

Do I have a second?

Doge, work with me.
What, do you want to do it?

You don't even have thumbs.

All right, second,
that's a second.

Scout, time for a speech.
You have the floor.

Wow. First off,
let me just say how...

I mean, how honored I am
to be nominated

for this incredibly prestigious
role of benevolent dictator.

Benevolent, <i>bene,</i>
from the Latin meaning "well,"

and <i>velle,</i> meaning "to wish."

A well-wisher
and someone who wishes well

with the absolute
authority to enforce

her-- or his, or his.

Her or his vision
of a better world.

If elected benevolent dictator,

I will work tirelessly
to promote the ideals

we hold dearest
here in Scoutopia,

including environmentalism.

Uh, I believe music should be
played at a reasonable volume.

Also, I don't think
we need an Oxford comma.

There I said it.

I promise to pass
the Bechdel test.

I promise to invest in
innovation over tradition.

Because you know what they say.

The definition of insanity
is these prices!

It's time to give the power
back to the people

by taking it away
from them entirely.

So, vote for me
for benevolent dictator

and I promise to wish you well.

Also, death to all squirrels.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you, Scout.

Way to read the room.

All those in favor of Scout
for benevolent dictator,

please say, "Aye." Aye.

All opposed?

Abstentions?

Doge, work with me here,

we can't pass this
without a quorum.

Great. The motion passes.

As of this moment, Scout is
officially benevolent dictator

of the sovereign nation state
of Scoutopia

on this 23rd day of Scoutember.

Take that, America,
I can do anything--

<i>â™ª Wake up at 10:30,</i>

Tourists.

Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying

to get a hold of you
for two days.

Sorry. Natasha cut me out
of the family plan.

Don't apologize,
it takes away your authority.

Ooh, so, she's really gone, huh?

I don't know, Britney,
I feel like there's a chance.

You got a dog?

I love dogs. Come here.

Yes, I got a dog.
I'm an entirely new person.

Careful,
she doesn't like flannel.

Okay, you're clearly
emotionally distraught.

I'm not distraught.
Trust me, you're distraught.

Remember when Clarissa left

and you didn't eat anything
for three days?

Have you been eating?
I brought snacks.

I'm eating.

Popcorn doesn't
count as a food.

-Neither does rosÃ©.
-Yes, it does.

So, she really took everything.

You're gonna
have to get new stuff.

Actually, I don't--

I don't feel like
I want new stuff.

-You have to have stuff.
-Why?

Because it's stuff.

Did you-- did you fall
and hit your head?

Yes, why?

'Cause you're bleeding.

You're also acting
really weird.

I'll go get Band-Aids.

Natasha took all the Band-Aids.

Bitch.

I'll take care of it.
Stop.

-Oh.
-What are you doing, honey?

I wiped it. I wiped it.

Now you have blood
on your shirt.

Now I have blood on my shirt.

You're right,
I'm gonna go change.

-You have blood on your shirt.
-I know, I'll change.

Honestly, I'm glad she's gone.

-Britney? Oh.
-No, Natasha.

we didn't get along.
And I get along with everyone.

I mean, Clarissa and I
get along great,

and she's a raging narcissist.

-You need to spackle this.
-She wasn't a narcissist.

Uh, yes, she was.

She dressed up as herself
for Halloween,

including a wig.

Look, can we stop talking
about my exes

and focus on
the amazing transformation

that is underfoot?

I am an entirely new person.

You have popcorn in your teeth.

-You have popcorn in your butt.
-Great.

Can I borrow this?
Yes.

You know what?

As a matter of fact...

So, are there cups, or...

we supposed to just chug this
like a poor person?

All clothing except
for jumpsuits is illegal now.

-Scoutopia.
-What's Scoutopia?

It's my sovereign nation state.

Girl, you can't just
wear jumpsuits.

Yes, I can, Ashley.
Imagine the future, okay?

-What are people wearing?
-Jetpacks.

Fenty by Rihanna.

What? No, no.
They're wearing jumpsuits,

utilitarian jumpsuits.

I mean, the technology exists.

Why hold ourselves back?
What are we, the coal industry?

It's been 48 hours.

Oh, yeah, Ashley,
as if time were linear, okay?

Viva la revoluciÃ³n.

-This is fun.
-Why can't you just

have sex with a Tinder person,
like a normal human being?

Did you know
Natasha's dad voted for Trump,

and I didn't
say anything because, like,

I didn't want it to be,
I don't know, awkward.

I mean, we live our entire
lives on autopilot.

And why? For what? Why?

I've been on autopilot
this whole time? I had no idea.

You can't spell success
without seceding.

That's why I'm
my own country now, okay?

From now on, if something
is not 100% authentic

to who I am, I'm out.
I'm not doing it. Scoutopia.

Do you still want to go
to the brunch rave?

Obviously, it's a brunch rave.

Okay, great, Britney,
put this in your jumpsuit.

I love brunch.

Did you know there's
no such thing as local honey?

Bees aren't even native
to North America.

Everything we've been taught
to believe in is a lie.

Do you want me to get started
about the gold industry?

I mean, you want to talk about
a corrupt industry--

Okay, I hear you.
But literally, who cares?

I do. About everything.

But every day I'm trying
to meditate

and be more like him.

The DJ?
Ugh, no.

No one wants to be
more like a DJ.

Like him.

Feet firmly planted,
waving in the breeze.

Going whenever life takes you.
A party full of music,

and yet only one of us
is brave enough to dance.

Okay, you just got dumped
by your fiancÃ©e,

so maybe we take a beat.

That's exactly my point.

I don't even believe
in marriage.

And Natasha knew that.

As far as I'm concerned,

straight people should have
been marching to get out

rather than gay people
marching to get in.

Hmm, fair.

And who was the first--

who was
the first woman to be like,

"Oh, I want to throw
a love party

and I'm going
to invite all my friends

and I'm going to wear white.

And then no one else at
the party gets to wear white."

You gotta find a jiggly piece.

"But some of my friends
are going to wear a dress

in a different color,
and that color

is going to match
the accent color on my flowers.

And then when I finish
with my flowers,

I'm going to throw it
at my friends."

Damn, you're good.

"Also, I want a cake.

What kind of cake?
I don't know.

I'm going to try all the kinds
of cake in a day of testing.

Even though as an adult woman,

I've clearly had
all the kinds of cake.

No, I want you to line the
cake types up in front of me.

And then I'm gonna taste
them one by one.

A carrot cake.
Yellow cake. Princess cake.

Ribbon cake.
Sprinkle cake. Confetti cake.

I want to try all of
the kinds of cake."

I love cake.

Are we done with this bit
or do you have more?

"Also, I want everybody
to bring me presents,

but I get
to pick which presents."

How hard did you hit
your head today?

I don't know, Ashley,
just hard enough.

No!

Jenga.

How could you do that?
Scout effing Durwood.

Who's that?
That is--

Scout fricking Durwood.

Can you please,
'cause I have this. 'Cause--

What the S are you doing here?

Oh, hi.
Uh, Jade, this is Ashley.

Ashley, Jade.
Hi.

Britney.
Britney, yeah.

And this is
The Inuit word for love.

Come again?

The Inuit word for love.

Sorry, what's the Inuit
word for love?

My baby.

Right. And-- and what's the
baby's name?

The Inuit word for love.

-Which is...
-Oh, I can't say it,

because that would be
appropriation.

But my husband and I just
really wanted to pay homage

to the people
who came before us.

So, it's kind of like
a respect thing.

That's what this feels
like right now. Respect.

Well, he is Canadian, right?

Oh, beautiful language.

Canadian?
Inuit.

Oh, I know.

Did you guys know
they have over, like,

a hundred words for snow?

Did you know that
no, they don't?

See, the Inuit language makes
a compound word out of nouns

and their modifiers.

So, white snow, for example,
becomes one word, whitesnow,

or yellow snow to yellowsnow.

Not to be confused
with slipperysnow.

Or is it gonnasnow
or snowysnow?

Did you know Americans have
13 different words

for the submarine sandwich?

Hero, hoagie, grinder, sub,

meat bed,
tuna pocket, bread basket,

slider, pita futon,
pizza... roll.

There's a lot.

There's so many,
I could keep going.

And yet only one word for love.

Speaking of which,
where is Natasha?

Uh, we-- we broke up.

Well, most relationships end.

Except for the one
you have with yourself.

That, you can
hold on to for forever.

Unless you're
an asshole about it.

Can you please-- can you please
not curse in front of the baby?

I didn't curse in front
of your baby.

You-- you did. You said--
you said the A word, Ashley.

-It's not appropriate.
-I'm sorry.

I didn't know I was cursing
in front of your baby.

Yeah, and now you woke him up.

You woke him up.

I'm not in front
of your baby.

Well, you woke him up with your
cursing, so... Come here.

Oh, hi.

Do you want to hold him?
No, I don't.

-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

-I'm totally fine.
-You won't drop him.

I am-- I'm good, without the--

Scout, I literally
don't mind, okay.

No, I don't-- I don't--
I don't want to hold the baby.

-Scout. Scout.
-I'm totally-- I just...

Just wait till they have kids.

Nobody understands new moms
except for other new moms.

Only a mom can tell you that.

Hello?

Is that a baby?

Hello?

I'm a new mom, where are you?

I can help you.

I'm here, are you lost, Hayden?

I have bars in my purse.

Scout, wait up.

Scout, why you walking so fast?

Because I can.

Do you see these cars
down there?

Yeah.

Every one of them thinks
that their destination

is the most important
on the road.

But if any one of them tries
to beat the system by--

by changing lanes, or--

or moving faster than
the speed of traffic,

then the entire system
breaks down,

and every one of them
is moving more slowly

than if they'd been moving
together the whole time.

Come on.

That's why driverless cars are
going to be such a big deal.

Not only do
they mitigate human ego,

they mitigate human error.

For what is humanity,
if not a vessel

..for well-intended mistakes.

Whoa.

You, like,
think about a lot of stuff.

It's a prison!

See that car over there?

Yeah.
Okay, well,

idling your car
for more than, like,

10 seconds at a time,
horrible for your engine.

-But I thought that--
-No, that is a myth.

It's also terrible for
the environment.

And in neighborhoods
where it happens a lot,

it delays
brain development in kids.

It results in childhood asthma.

And yet people
do it all the time.

People go to drive-thrus
to idle their car.

Idle car, idle heart.

Well, maybe she doesn't know.
I'll go tell her.

No, you can't go around
correcting people

who don't want to be corrected.

It's rude and it's ineffective
and they hate you.

And yet I can no longer abide
living in a world

so wedded to being wrong.

Therefore, Scoutopia.

Whoa.
Hey,

what route did you guys take?
That took forever.

You guys hungry?
I want some tacos.

Wait, we're not wedded
to being wrong.

I don't know, Ashley
just upgraded to the 11.

What, my phone? Shoots in 8k.
How cool is that?

It's also
planned obsolescence.

I want to join Scoutopia.

Wait, are we still
talking about this?

Scoutopia doesn't exist,
Britney. Scout made it up.

Okay, first of all,
all countries are made up.

And second of all,
no, you don't.

It is very hard being
a Scoutopian.

Like, we can't even chew gum

unless it's specifically
labeled biodegradable.

Gum isn't biodegradable?

No, it's also the second most
littered item on the planet.

Cigarette butts are number one.

-Talk about a sticky situation.
-Yeah, well, you're welcome.

Look, my parents
raised me to believe

that I could be anything.

Do you know
how stressful that is?

Oh, I didn't know
you were born in the '90s.

Let me join Scoutopia.

I don't know, running
a sovereign nation state

is going really well
for me right now,

and I don't want
to jeopardize that by, like,

attracting human followers.

Okay, well,
then who's that creeper?

What?

Hi. Sorry, I, like,
couldn't help but overhear you

at the brunch rave.
And I totally agree.

And also traffic?

Pew! Who knew?

Oh, thank you.

What's Scoutopia?

It's our sovereign
nation state.

-Do you want to join?
-Yes.

No, no, to this.
We don't even know this person.

I don't know, Scoutopia has
open borders, it's like...

-They do?
-Mmm-hmm.

Okay, well,
you just can't chew your gum.

Oh, yeah, no problem.

You have to-- Yeah. Give it.

Hand it over. I'll take it.

Yeah. Safekeeping.

Okay, great. This is great.

Scout, what are you doing?

-This is insane.
-Oh, no, no,

idling your car is insane.

This is inspiring
social change.

-What's next?
-Next we live our lives

and go through the world trying
to make it a better place.

Starting with our Pledge of
Allegiance to the flag.

-We don't have a flag.
-Don't we?

Did you steal that?

<i>â™ª Okay, kids, we're about</i>

<i>â™ª To the sky-- â™ª</i>

And that is how you Dougie.

Bless--

Out, demon. Out, evil spirit.

Take not this woman's soul,
for we value her among us.

...You.
Why do you bless

someone after
they sneeze, Ashley?

You don't bless them
after they cough or burp,

after they fart.

Thank you, Kourtney.

So why bless someone
after they sneeze? Ashley.

Superstition.
People used to think that

after you sneeze,
the devil was gonna--

That the devil
was gonna steal your soul.

That the devil was gonna
reach inside your nose holes,

pull your soul out of it and
replace it with an evil spirit.

Is that what
you believe, Ashley?

-No--
-No, of course not.

Because Ashley is a rational,
thinking human being.

Or... is she?

Because knowing all of this,
when Kourtney sneezed...

She blessed her. Why?

Because you value tradition
over original thought.

-Okay, isn't that right?
-I wasn't--

Thinking? No, of course
you weren't thinking.

But are any of us thinking,
when we--

when we throw our money away
on lottery tickets

or climb aboard
the deathtraps we call cars?

No. How could we be, okay?

We are all too--
we're all too...

distracted by
this constant deluge of--

Of advertisements

trying to get us to limit
our capacity for rational--

Rational...

My B.
Thought it was on vibrate.

What is wrong with you?

...Thought.

Yeah, Britney.

What are we doing tonight?

Same thing
we do every night, Britney.

Shots.

Somebody say shots?

<i>â™ª 10:00 PM</i>

<i>â™ª It's Ashley saying,</i>

<i>â™ª Britney's already</i>

<i>â™ª Britney throws up</i>

<i>â™ª I get in my car</i>

<i>â™ª But I crashed the car</i>

<i>â™ª The cops show up</i>
<i>'cause my car is on fire â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I punched the cop</i>

<i>â™ª Oops, my bad,</i>
<i>she called a Lyft â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She still could be dead,</i>
<i>do you guys want tacos? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Going out's the best â™ª</i>

Excuse me? It's too--

It's too loud.
Can you turn it down?

Turn-- thank you.

Our message is about love
and equality and no straws.

Yeah, that and a firm belief
that music should be played

at a reasonable volume.

Okay, I just talked to the DJ.
They said they'd turn it down.

So...
Oh, no conflict is approaching.

Protect your leader.
Scoutopia.

-Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey, girl.

-Not a girl.
-Yeah, we're not guys. So...

Yeah, obviously. You guys
come here alone, or, uh...

Mm, no,
we came with each other.

Oh... All right,
yeah, I see what's going on.

Yeah, I'm actually--

I'm actually a lesbian
trapped in a man's body.

-So totally get it.
-Doubt it.

Must be so hard for you
to shop for bras.

What size do you even buy?
42 AA extreme!

-Baby size.
-Got a nice lift.

You know my girlfriend
is, uh.. bi.

Swing through later if
you wanna have a little fun...

on me.

What was that about?
That was crazy.

-What's his deal?
-Ugh...

-What an awful...
-what is your face doing?

A bisexual girlfriend?
What is this, college?

-I'm just having some fun.
-Stop.

Like, what kind of monster
says no to fun?

-Oops, oh, no, what do I do?
-Stop. Homewrecker.

Not a homewrecker.
I'm a party starter.

Air guns, pew-pew-pew, byee!
Scoutopia!

Do you want me to run the cult
while you're gone?

No.
Okay, come on, Britney.

Let's get a drink.

For the last time,
my name's Kourtney.

-Oh, where's Britney?
-I don't know.

You know what? She's probably
still in the bathroom.

Peeing in a onesie
is not a game.

Yeah, it's not a game.

How long was I asleep for?

<i>â™ª All my friends</i>
<i>had warned me â™ª</i>

Oh, micro packaging?
No, thank you.

Adding a passenger? Cool.

Carpooling is, like, uber
important to me, but in a Lyft.

<i>â™ª Daybreak, I'll be</i>
<i>calling out your name â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Chasing night</i>
<i>'til morning... â™ª</i>

Did you know that 40%
of all urban litter

comes from fast food packaging?

-Ooh!
-Ah!

My God, you scared me.

I know. 'Cause, um,
fear releases dopamine,

which simulates
the feeling of falling in love.

Uh, a feeling which doubles
down when you realize

you're finally safe.
So, hi, I'm Scout.

-I'm, uh, Carrie.
-I knew you'd come by.

Let's get a bottle.
What do you drink? Vodka.

-Uh--
-Goochie wants Goosey.

Is that how we order now?
We just shout to the ether?

You wanna hit?
Uh, no, I feel like

you did enough
for the both of us.

It's mostly CBD.
Do you know what CBD is?

Yeah, I do.
My cousin runs a grow

-in, um, the--
-Tell you what. Keep that.

I'm CEO of the company,
Vape Nasty.

People think marijuana
is, like, this big bad drug,

but do you know how
many toxins are in Tylenol?

-I'm Goochie, by the way.
-Gooch?

Yeah, short for Goochman.
My parents were Dutch,

Original Goochie gang settlers.

Wow. I didn't know Dutch people
were the original Goochie ga--

-Yeah. Giddy up! Whoo!
-Oh.

Wow,
that's an intense--

-Pep talk?
-Uh, that depends.

-Is it fair trade?
-It's fair. You can have some.

Just trying to
avoid industries that, like,

contribute to
the global murder rate.

All right, babe,
do you wanna hit? She's boring.

Ew.

Don't you mean, "Ooh."

-More for me.
-Ooh. Yes, I do.

-Ooh.
-Ooh.

Ooh.

Wow. I've never made

Hey, I know this is fast.
Maybe it's my lesbian vibes.

-Yeah.
-But I think I love you, Scout.

-Polo.
-What?

Come on,
let's get out of here.

Too much blue light
before bed isn't good for you.

Releases cortisol,
messes up your metabolism.

Ooh, I will cortisol
you all night, girl.

Ow! Ow.

No low tables with
sharp corners. Scoutopia.

No low tables with sharp
corners. This is illegal now.

Come on, move it.
You, come on, help me.

Okay, let's go.
Come on. Scoutopia, let's go.

Guess this is how
we leave a party now.

-Scoutopia.
-Okay, let's go, let's go, go,

-go, come on, come on.
-Yeah. Whoo.

-That's my job. That's my job.
-Oh.

Just go. Turn around.
Go, go, go.

Don't fake it 'til you make it.
Fake it 'til you become it.

Yeah.
Scoutopia.

Yeah, 20%.
All right. Totally.

Totally. Buzz me tomorrow,
we could hash out the deets.

All right, peace.

Fuck, yeah.

Oh, dang, bro, I'm sorry.

I was totally in my
head trying to close this deal.

Uh, peace offering?

Fucking, my girlfriend left for
like a bunch of lesbians, so...

Saturdays are for the boys!

Dope shades, by the way.
I really like them.

I had a pair just like them.

Lost them on a jet ski
at my cousin's place in Tahoe.

Yeah, we used to get
up there, like, once a year.

Bunch of dudes, you know, just
hanging out doing dude stuff.

Still got the key,
you know, just in case.

Anyway, I got a vodka tonic
calling me "Daddy" upstairs,

so, uh, I better hit it.
Good talking to you.

You know, Tahoe's
only seven hours from here.

Six if I open her up.

Nah, man, that's-- that's really
dope of you to offer,

but I-- I gotta pass.

-Thanks anyway, though.
-Saturdays are for the boys.

You know what, bro? Fuck it.

Um, excuse me. Sorry.

I don't mean to
step on anybody's toes,

but I'm mostly positive
that we missed my stop.

I think we passed it.

Oh, God.

Mm.

<i>â™ª Taxi, take me home â™ª</i>

Oh, God, thank God.
Can you turn on the AC?

Um, sorry, do you know
that cigarette butts

are, like, the most
littered item on the planet?

What are you,
from Planet Do-Gooder?

Ugh, thank God.
I am starving.

We've been intermittently
fasting because apparently

that's a thing.
On top of these insane hours,

it's only going to get worse
the closer we get to November.

Wait, do you guys
know each other?

What, is she-- Are you kidding?
I cannot take her right now.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Please trade me.

Come on,
we get to smoke cigarettes

even though
we lobby against tobacco.

We don't believe in AC
because we're "leaning in"

and we say
we're going to go to the gym

all the time,
but we haven't been since 2016.

Come on, please.

Fuck it.
Anarchy's dead anyway.

Yes, sister.
You're not gonna regret this.

Have you ever had
brunch on a Tuesday?

Okay, my friends are
definitely wondering where I am

and also what
the fuck is happening?

Don't worry. You're next.

Everybody!
Show's about to start.

Let's do it! Whoo!

-Welcome, welcome, welcome.
-Hi, welcome. Welcome, hi.

-This is 100.
-Thank you. You are crazy.

How did everybody find
jumpsuits so fast?

Oh, my God, it's Ashley.

-Hi. Hi, welcome.
-Hey.

-So happy to have you
-Really happy to have you.

-Come on in. Hello.
-Welcome.

-Where did you popcorn?
-Thank you for coming.

Hurry on in.

I heard she literally
only eats popcorn

and cold pressed juice.

I heard that she's
a certified Pilates instructor.

You know how plastic
bags cost $0.10? She did that.

Guys, none of this is true.

-Shh, it's starting.
-You gotta calm down.

Hi, hi.

-Ladies and gentle-ladies.
-Nonbinary friends

-of all shapes and sizes,
-welcome to Scoutopia!

And now,
without further ado.

The one you've
all been waiting for.

Your hero and mine,
Scout Durwood!

Scout Durwood.

Oh, Scout!

I love you!

Yeah!

RosÃ© all day.
Oh, gosh.

Oh, you guys,
she's just--

Ah.

Yeah, burp, girl.

Hit it.

<i>â™ª Don't use straws â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Scout out â™ª</i>

I want to talk to
you today about caterpillars.

And more importantly, about
the butterflies they become.

See, inside its cocoon,
a caterpillar releases

the digestive enzyme that
disintegrates its body comple--

That disintegrates
its body entirely.

And from that primordial goo,

an entirely new creature--

An entirely--

An entirely new creature is--

An entirely
new creature is born.

What are you doing?

Oh, don't worry,
I've already heard this podcast.

-It's cool.
-Put your phone away.

Yeah, show your leader
some respect.

It's okay, Kourtney. Carrie.

Ashley's free
to do whatever she wants.

We value individual choice
here in Scoutopia, do we not?

I said do we not?

Nothing is more
important than individual loss

-and critical thought.
-Critical thought.

Yeah, great. Thank you.
Now, Ashley, what, uh--

what's so important
it couldn't wait?

Oh, nothing. I've just--
I've already listened

-to this podcast, so...
-What podcast?

Yeah,
what are you talking about?

Have you not noticed?

Most of what she's saying
she heard on a podcast.

What? No.

Is that true?

Uh, technically,
yeah, it is.

But wouldn't it be insane
to think I researched

-everything myself?
-No, right, but anecdotal news

is problematic,
and that's often the basis

for podcast narratives, so...

Interesting point, Ashley.

You got it.

Anyone else here
listen to podcasts?

Oh, I do.

Perhaps I am not
the free thinker I aspire to be.

Everyone,
take out your phones.

Go ahead, take them out.
That's right.

In 1971, there was a famous
anti-littering campaign

nicknamed the Crying Indian.

Their nickname, not mine.
Yeah. Problematic. Yeah.

In that commercial,

a Native American
man sheds a single tear

in response to highway litter.

And who sponsored that campaign?

Beverage
manufacturing companies.

Who were trying to avoid

regulation on their newly
released invention,

non-reusable packaging.

Yeah, people who litter
are monsters, they said.

But how dare we criticize
the corporations

who are filling
their hands with trash?

Treat the symptoms,
ignore the disease.

You know where
I first heard about

-the Crying Indian campaign?
-On a podcast?

On a podcast.

Cell phones are illegal now.
Scoutopia.

Everyone please smash--

-- phones. Ashley?

-Yeah.
-Would you like to go next?

-No.
-Why not?

You can't expect us
to follow you blindly.

That goes against
everything that we stand--

-...for.
-Look, the point of Scoutopia

is to be better
versions of ourselves.

I thought the point
of Scoutopia

was to be fiercely judgmental
and mostly vegetarian.

You are free to make whatever
decision you wish to make,

as long as
you make the right one.

-Now smash your phone.
-No.

Don't you see
you are holding on

to something
that is holding you back.

I'm trying to help you.

Look, I get that you don't
want to wear a bra anymore.

I mean, who does?
And honestly, these jumpsuits

are super comfy,
but this is insane.

Au contraire, Ashley,
this is insane.

Tap twice if you like me.

Tap twice
if you wish to be liked.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

-Stop it.
-Tap, tap, tap.

They threaten you with obscurity

and from obscurity,
you obey.

-Hey, you're scaring me.
-Good! You'll appreciate it

even more when you finally
realize that you're safe.

-Give me my phone.
-No, I-- ow!

-Natasha has cancer.
-What?

"Just found out it's cancer,
but my new girlfriend

is the perfect nurse.

Thank you to everyone for
all your thoughts and prayers.

#FuckCancer, #Hope"

Scout, I had no idea.

Most relationships end.

Even our relationship with
our existence on this plane.

-Death is all part of it.
-Shh.

Why do you still have
Twitter notifications

from Natasha?

I don't know.

<i>â™ª Sad songs</i>
<i>are inappropriate â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you sing them</i>

<i>Everything you're</i>

<i>â™ª I found out on Twitter</i>

<i>â™ª But her new girlfriend is</i>

<i>â™ª That's a lot of new feelings</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, whoa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because effectively,</i>
<i>I mourned you on the day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You went away and made</i>

<i>â™ª You don't want to be friends</i>

â™ª Indefinitely, and when I
asked him who was helping â™ª

<i>â™ª The vet said the cat</i>

Wait.
What are you doing?

Don't you see, Ashley?
I am setting you free!

Oh! Oh!

Sorry I'm late,
peeing in a onesie's no joke.

-Who are you?
-Everybody, get down!

Since when do you have a gun?

Conceal and carry, baby.

Second Amendment for life!
Fucking idiot, Carrie.

She's gone! That person's gone!

Oh, my God, is that 'cause
she used a straw?

I saw her use a straw.

Don't worry, guys, I got this.

Oh, my God, are you flirting
with me right now?

-What do I do, Scout?
-Run towards the light.

Okay!

Kourtney, no.
We have to explore this.

Okay, I need everyone to just
give me a minute.

Eenie, meenie, minie-- ooh!

I think she's gone.

Ooh.

No, no, no, no.

Doge?

Doge, doge.

Oh, my goddess,
I thought I lost you, too.

Oh, shade. I cannot believe
how badly this is going.

I lost my coat.
I lost my friends.

My dog won't even talk to me.

At least now I officially
have nothing left to lose.

TouchÃ©.

This is your stop.

Oh, I think
this is your stop.

I'm closer to La Brea.

Oh, my God,
I cannot with this girl.

Bubbla. Britney. Welcome.

There are over
30,000 bees in this hive,

and yet only one queen.

Do you feel like there's
something special about you?

Something that separates
you from everyone else?

-No.
-Me neither.

Because we are the Britneys,

universal followers who maintain
order by supporting our hive.

Without us, no leader can lead,
for without us...

there's no one to be led.

Did you know there's
no such thing as local honey?

Bees aren't even native
to North America.

-I read that on a podcast.
-A great sentiment.

However, think-- think of
all the wonderful things

they've done
since they arrived.

They take
the sweetest bits of this,

the most potent bits of that.

You know, if bees go extinct,
that all of humanity will die.

Yet another sticky situation.

Pure change is more
than just a great idea.

I get a great idea.
You got a great idea.

We all get great ideas.
It's about follow up,

follow through, followers.

Go be that follower, Britney.

Don't let your leader give up.

Scram. Get out of here.

-Wait, where are you going?
-Well, this is your stop.

I don't even know where I am.

Wait, has your car
been idling this entire time?

Don't you care anything
about the environment?

Idle car, idle heart.

Scout?

Scout, wait up!

So this is what
the end of hope looks like.

Nothing to hold on to,
nothing to hold me back.

Scout.

Scout. Hi.

Oh, my gosh. Britney.

-Hi.
-Where have you been?

I took a Lyft.
I thought I told you.

Yeah, but that was
two days ago.

I know.

So what did I miss?

Well, kind of a lot.

Uh, I was confronted
by my evil twin.

I singlehandedly negated
all of the good

I set out
to create in the world.

And in a quest for power,
I have become everything I hate,

as evidenced by the fact that
everyone I love now hates me.

Oh. That sounds tough.

Yeah, Britney,
this is all turning out to be

significantly tougher than
I ever dreamed it could be.

Well, hey, don't give up.

What you mean, don't give up?

Everything I've done since
Natasha left me is garbage.

Not everything.

I pledge allegiance
to the wacky waver

of the United States
of Scoutopia...

And to the shepublic
for which it stands,

one nation under Scout,

indivisible, with liberty
and justice for Scoutopia.

Scout, life is a party
filled with music.

It'd be a shame if you were no
longer brave enough to dance.

Thanks, Britney.

You're right and I needed that.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I have a cult to save.

Yeah! Go do it!
You got this, Scout.

Oh, my God. I'm doing it.
I'm a Britney

and I'm a follower
and I'm doing it.

Wait, Scout, wait up.
God damn it.

I'm an idiot. Okay.

<i>â™ª Feet like a trunk</i>
<i>and shake your butt â™ª</i>

<i>â™ªI'm gonna do this</i>
<i>and change the world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sky dancer â™ª</i>

I got this. I got this.

I can't do this.
What am I doing? I can't just--

I'm going to do this.
I got this. Okay.

Eyes on the prize,
changing the world.

You've got this, Scout.

Into the abyss.

Hello?
Oooh!

You're right.
That's fun. That's-- ooh!

-Who are you?
-Oh, how rude of me.

I'm Scout.

That's impossible. I'm Scout.

Surely you can't think

there's only one of you
in the universe.

Oh, you do?

-Well, how quaint.
-There's more than one of me?

There's more
than one of everybody.

Literally everything
in the universe

exists because
of patterns in math.

I forgot
how endearingly preoccupied

this universe is
with trying to be special.

Spoiler alert,
there's no such thing.

I'm from an alien planet
populated entirely

by people who look
and act just like you.

I've come to take you there.

Come on, let's go home.

I-- I--

What are you doing?
Don't you want to come home?

What about my friends?
What about them?

You said it yourself.
They're medium friends.

Yeah, but
they're my medium friends.

Okay, well, now
I'm your medium friend.

Technically,
I am a liaison between worlds.

A medium, if you will.

Devastating, really,
that this world can't be saved.

These separations
are never pleasant.

But as they say,
the fate of the universe

-depends on us, so...
-Separations.

Do you know where the word
utopia comes from, Scout?

Yeah, obviously it's Greek.

"Ou" meaning not, and "topos",
meaning place. Utopia.

Not a place.
Mm-hmm. But a youtopia?

Y-O-U.

Now there's a juice
that's worth the squeeze.

A metopia?

There are infinite topias
in the universe.

Generally speaking,
people prefer to mix and match,

entropy being
what it is and all.

But every once in a while,
the conversation

gets a little too... rowdy.

One of these
separations begins.

You can already
see the roots of it here.

I mean, there are infinite
points of view available,

and yet most people prefer
an echo chamber of their own.

Right, but there's no way
the solution is to have

fewer points of view.

What about the point of view

that you shouldn't, um,
vaccinate your children?

Um, that's not a point of view.
That's incorrect.

That's-- Wait, is there an
entire planet of anti-vaxxers?

Well, they've never technically
populated an entire planet.

One person gets the measles
and the whole planet's gone.

I mean, you should
see Natashatopia.

It's nothing but collared
shirts and Twitter feeds.

Natasha's
not on another planet.

She just tweeted about cancer.

Oh, honestly,
most people on Twitter

are actually just citizens
of Natashatopia.

I mean, haven't you noticed
the redundancies?

Ugh-- Who's still even
on Twitter these days?

In Scoutopia,
we don't even have smartphones,

just portable podcast devices.

Huge fan of yours,
by the way.

Oh my God,
you listen to my podcast?

Everyone on Scoutopia
loves your podcast.

Just like we love you.

No. If there's one thing

all citizens of Scoutopia
must agree on

it's that there's
no such thing as love.

Except for self love.

That, you can
hold on to for forever.

Come home with us, Scout.

We love you
like no one else can.

And isn't that what everyone
wants in the end?

To be loved?

No!

No!

Ow.
Are you okay?

What the fuck Ashley?

I shot somebody.
Oh, my God, my body.

Gosh, did I pick wrong?

No, no, you picked right.
I'm-- I'm alien Scout, hello.

You monster.
She doesn't want anything to do

-with your bullshit plan, okay?
-No, I do.

-I do. I want it...
-Life is not about surrounding

yourself
with like-minded individuals.

It's about exposing yourself
to new perspectives

you never dreamed existed.
Yes, I do.

-It's about--
-No. No. Take me to...

-Scoutopia.
-What?

Imagine a world
where you didn't have to worry

about rape, Ashley.
Like, just for starters.

Ima-- Imagine never having to
have another conversation about

the importance of science
over belief. Imagine--

Did I mention the entire
planet is also gluten-free?

It's usually a big draw.
Come on, I gotta go there.

If only I live long...
Wait, I have an idea.

I knew I kept this
for a reason. It's my gum.

I can use
it to seal the wound.

-Stop that.
-What is the matter with you?

She's going to be fine.
There's no such thing

as deadly force on Scoutopia.

We're not on Scoutopia.
We're in my apartment.

And your apartment is?

-Scoutopia.
-A portal to Scoutopia.

-A portal to Scoutopia.
-I opened it just a minute ago.

I thought we were going, and
then this happened and so--

but we gotta go now 'cause
it will close eventually.

Takes a lot of energy
and we're very eco-fre--

You know-- I don't
have to explain it to you.

You've already-- We gotta go.
Gotta go.

Okay.
What about me?

Oh. Well, I guess...

most relationships end.

Yeah. I guess they do.

Hey, I'm-- I'm really
sorry about everything, I--

Don't apologize.
Takes away your authority.

Good. Maybe-- maybe
it's about time someone did.

Looks like I was
the medium friend all along.

Yeah. You were.

Oh. I was.

-Okay.
-Are you ready now?

I'm ready. Wait.

-I want you to keep Doge.
-Okay.

So a part of
me will always live on.

Oh, you can take Doge
to Scoutopia.

Everyone on
that planet has a rescue dog.

Literally everyone
on the planet is you.

-So, they all have a--
-Oh, okay.

In that case,
bye, guys.

-Bye.
-Say bye, Doge. Bye.

-What's that?
-It's the Inuit word for love.

Now what?

Now it's your turn, biotch.

I'm here to take you home, girl.

-Who are you?
-Wait, wait, I got this.

Okay, how much
do you know about bees?

I'm taking you
to Ashleytopia, honey.

-Ashleytopia?
-Yeah. You know how you feel

-about high-low dresses.
-Yes.

That they're
the mullets of evening wear.

Imagine a world
where they don't even exist.

Huh?

Imagine a world where cap
sleeves are a thing of the past.

So, this is
what we're doing now?

We're all just gonna
go to our own planets

where everyone
has the same beliefs?

You're flirting with me
right now. Come on, let's go.

Okay, I'm not gonna
go to an alien planet.

I'm not doing it. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna leave the house

because I don't have
a reason to stay here.

But I'm not gonna teleport.

-Anywhere.
-Bye.

It's a--
it's a death machine.

I heard about it on a podcast.

-Have fun.
-Hey, my next ride is here.

-You gonna be okay?
-I think so.

All right, well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

And remember,
things won't get better

unless you demand
for them to change.

Holy cannoli.
Biodegradable gum.

-I get to chew gum again.
-Check out that gum.

Well, this is exciting.
I love chewing gum.

It's not really the consistency
I'm used to. This is not--

Okay. Well, bye, Britney.
Thank you, Other Britney.

I can get used to this.

Oh, I'll get it.

Hello? Hi. Sorry,
the door was open.

Hey. Oh, that's okay.

Well, I'm here on behalf
of the organization,

You Are Not a Loan.

We grant micro loans
to women-run businesses

in the developing world.

I was wondering if I could just
have a moment of your time.

You can have
all the moments of my time.

Also, uh, what's a micro loan?

Really? Oh, uh, yeah.

A micro loan
is like a macro loan,

but smaller,
because it's for women.

-Well, that's not okay, right?
-Yeah.

Would you be
interested in helping?

-I would love to help.
-Really?

If you'll have me, yes.

-Wow, I wasn't expecting this.
-Me neither.

Yeah, well, uh, do you wanna
go door to door with me?

-I would love nothing more.
-Oh, that's so great.

This is such
a passionate cause of mine.

You know, macro loans,
those are too big for women.

But if you get a small--
just a small enough amount--

We don't require as much.
