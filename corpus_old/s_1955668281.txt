(glass breaking)

(sound of train passing by)

[Voiceover] That wraps
up the first edition

of the Pittsburgh Pulse.

Our thanks to Democratic
Congressman Mark Allen

and Alyssa Denolfo of the
Penn Conservative League

for joining us today.

[Voiceover] We hope you'll
join us every Saturday

as we look at the day's
top issues from all sides.

Even McCormack's whacked
out lefty perspective.


And Mike will continue his quest

to make Bill O'Reilly
look progressive.

We've got shows coming
up on Wall Street Reform,

calls for national energy
policy, and the drive for

marriage equality in
the Keystone State.

Mike loves that one.


And of course you can
follow our columns

Tuesdays and Thursdays
in the Times Herald.

Until next time
I'm Mike Steinman.

I'm Colin McCormack

on The Pulse.

Who's your daddy?


Okay okay, so this year
turned out pretty good.

Mike, Colin, nice work.

Yes


Okay, it's enough.

Enough.

I don't need their
egos any bigger.

Now, maybe ya heard this.

Print is dead.

How 'bout them apples?

Christ.

So, corporate is hot for
the potential synergy here.

I swear to God if I never
say that word again.

Anyways, since you've
seen the commercials

tomorrow at noon.

So keep spreading the word.


The rest of you clowns,
enjoy the weekend.

Amber, did you get
those Medicare stats?

(Amber talking into phone)

Okay, Amber is
a stripper name.

And you can't hire someone
with a stripper name

to produce a news show.

Yeah, tell that to Steinman.

Listen, did I see interns?

Yeah.

Started yesterday.

Can I borrow one?

I've got a little
research project

and I swear Amber just
goes to Wikipedia.

(both chuckling)

Monday okay?

Perfect.

Heading out.

Gotta get to the gym.

Or you can just give
in to middle age spread

like the rest of us.

Maybe I will.

When I'm middle aged.

(slap on butt)

Oh!

(rock music)

* And I fucked up

* yet again

* A long

* a long way

(imitating drum solo)

(indistinct singing)

* It don't matter

[TV announcer] Six
unanswered points.

Shit!

[TV announcer] Panthers
can't afford this kind

of deficit in the early going.

Stamina's a big question--

(phone ringing)

Well, there you are.

Why is it celebrities
are never on time?

Seriously, you and Madonna
always keep me waiting.

[Colin] It's in the handbook.

How was the screening?

[Colin] It turned out great.

Kind of weird to see
myself on TV though.

[Other man] Oh right.

You know you can't
wait to be besieged

by adoring fans.

Got my first one today.

Caught one of the
interns checking me out.

Kind of cute too.

[Other man] Colin.

[Colin] Oh relax.

I like em young but
there are limits.

[Other man] Do we need
to have a little talk

about sexual harassment?

You know, it's
generally frowned upon.

[Colin] Shut it.

The game's started.

They're getting hammered.

(door closing)

Yo.

Oh, come on!

Where's the defense?!

[Other man] What?

Is it getting worse?

(TV announcer talking)

Down 12 already, Jesus.

Hey.

Welcome back.

[Other man] Please.

I don't know that
one journal article

counts as a career renaissance.

Always on the
bright side with you.

Yeah, that's
part of the charm.

Oh!

Come on.

Harper is throwing bricks.

They need to sit him now.

Buh bye.

Easy Prince Charming.

Get your food
before it ices over.

Ah see.

I should coach.

You're a genius.

Hey...

We should go out tonight.

After the game.

We should celebrate.

Nah.

Stewart.

When was the last
time you got some?

Let's see.

Truman was president so--

(Colin laughing)

No, wait.

Eisenhower, so see I'm good.
You have fun.

Oh...

I will.

(loud club music)

Mom.

Mom I can't--

You're slurring.

I can't understand you.

He said what?

What did he--

I'm sure he didn't mean that.

I said I'm su--

Why don't you just
call me tomor--

No.

No.

I don't want to talk to him.

Mom, no--

Fuck!

Hi dad.

Yes sir, I can tell.

Just tell her I'll--

Dad.

Are you there?

(raunchy rock music)

* Down in the hole

* Worn and faded

* Torn and jaded

* Thrown away

* Overrated, understated

Yo.

Are we two or three?

Kicked him out.

[Stewart] Oh
good, I'm starving.

I let you have an extra hour.

(cell phone ringing)

Hey, dad.

What's up?

Hey Tom.

You see--

Oh, fuck!

(Collin mumbling in agreement)

(alarm beeping)

Collin, your show.

Is it on DVR?

Alex died.

Your uncle Liam's Alex?

Massive stroke last night.

Oh my God.

Liam's devastated.

So...

We're gonna go out
to L.A. just to...

Be with them.

Help with all the arrangements.

You want me to go with?

Yeah.

Dad would really
appreciate that.

Liam too.

[Voiceover] I feel like
I was blessed to have him.

And ah...

Now I feel blessed again because

you're all here with me.

To celebrate his life.

My big brother Tom.

Thank you Tommy.

For giving me away when Alex

finally could make
an honest man of me.


And our precious...

Precious friends.

You know, Alex's family...

They never accepted who he was.

And that hurt him more
than you can imagine.

But you...

All of you,

you were his family.

[Stewart] It's very
nice to meet you.

I want you to think about it.

I will.

I promise.

Search Committee at UCLA.

I know, crazy right?

You boys, don't
miss your plane.

Love you dad.

Love you son.

Stu, thanks for coming out.

Of course.

Appreciate it.

You look very
handsome Stewart.

Thanks Mrs. M.

They're gonna
miss their plane.

Go go go go.

(indistinct chatter)

After 50 years.

Have we missed out?

That's a dangerous question.

What color's the car?

(car beeping)
I mean growing up I wanted

to be just like
my dad, you know?

Devoted wife, couple of kids.

But when I realized I
was gay I guess I thought

a family just
wasn't in the cards.

Please, you're not
the marrying kind.

You're more of a...

Slut.

Shut it.


I mean, yeah but...

And don't forget all the spunk

you sold for beer money at Yale.

(squirting sound)

Check it off.

Stewart.

Jesus, you're not...

What?

You make it
impossible sometimes.

Are we talking
actual feelings here?

Do we do that?

Not if you can help it?

Okay, I'm listening.

Mmm, who's your daddy?

Just give me the keys.

(car beeping)

[Voiceover] I'll
tell you why Pat.

The bible very clearly tells us

that marriage is between
a man and a woman

and it is a sacred covenant.

The bible also very
clearly tells us

that homosexuality
is an abomination.

And that is the word.

Abomination.
Knock knock.

[Voiceover] To claim that
homosexuals should be allowed--

What the fuck?

The Reverend Irvin Lockwood.

Amber booked him for the show

on marriage equality.

Of course she did.

I come bearing intern.

Why are you lurking like that?

Come on in here.

Come on.

He's not gonna bite.

Colin McCormack, Thaddeus Bloom.

It's Tee.

Goes by Tee.

[Colin] Nice to meet you, Tee.

Shar showed me your samples.

Some of the strongest student
writing I've ever read.

Really?

You liked it?

That's, wow.

Okay, this one won't
stop talking about you.

Colin this, Colin that.

You'd think you
were Justin Beaver.

Uh, it's Bieber, Shar.

Not Beaver.

Whatevs.

Figured you know.


All right.

My shit comes first.

Capisce?

Yes ma'am.

(chuckles) Ma'am.

Can you fucking believe this?


Okay.

So, are you familiar with
Reverend Irvin Lockwood?

Yes, sir.

Pops made me watch
him every Sunday.

Oh, you're not a...

No sir.

The Reverend is not too
fond of us homosexuals.

I kind of hate him.

Well, we need to
stay objective here.

But,

there are rumors.

I'm sure you've heard.

The mistress?

The mistress.

That's the devil's
tongue talking.

So he says.

No one's been able
to connect the dots.

But I thought if we
gathered all various sources

that do exist.

We can see all
the dots he wants?

Right.

This guys calls himself
a defender of marriage.

If he's screwing around...

I wanna nail him on it.

We have a month.

See what you can find.

Yes sir.

Tee, um...

This whole sir thing,

it's killing me.

Just Colin please.

Yes sir--

Colin.

[Stewart] Holy
crap, traffic was--

Oh, uh...

You're looking for Colin?

He's in Ms. Miyake's office.

Thanks.

I still think you're
too ugly for TV.

And the makeup helps.

You're still wearing
it, you know.

It kind of makes
me feel pretty.

Great show guys.

[Mike] Hey.

Good night.

Uh, Medicare?

Oh sorry.

I didn't get to it.

[Colin] Admit it
Mike, you hired her

for her tits.

McCormack please,
there's a lady present.

Fuck that.

Answer the question.


(door knocking)

Hey Stu.

Hey Shar.

Michael.

Stu man.

Game starts in 20 and
I don't wanna have to

chase people from our seats.

Did you get my message?

Oh.

Shit.

We were taping so I
turned off my phone.

All right ladies.

Better go wash this makeup off

so the wife doesn't think
McCormack's giving me the gay.

(Mike taunting)

Do you guys even
read his columns?


So, who was that
in your office?

Tee, short for Thaddeus.

He's an intern.

What's this about, an interview?

UCLA.

They're flying me out
for some meetings.

I have one next week.

So you applied.

Well, it seemed
like such a long shot.

You don't think I should?

Huh?

Oh no, It's just...

I mean they're a
big deal, right?

I thought you were over
high pressure academia.

I don't know.

Fifteen years?

Maybe I can handle
the political bullshit

now that I'm older.

Yeah but...

You're happy here, right?

Avoiding the question?

Perpetually.

(melancholic music)

[Colin] How do you fix that?

I've had three different
IT guys in here.

McCormack, I gotta
bail on the game.

Little Mike's been
puking all day

and the wife's in a mood.

Is he all right?

Yeah, he's fine.

He's a kid.

He eats bugs.

You know.

Did you eat bugs?

I don't think so.

Me either.


Hey.

Any interest in catching
a basketball game?

I still can't believe you
spent two years at UNC

and never went to a single game.

Here, let me--

What?

It still has the
stickers on it.

That's hip hop man.

Leaving he stickers on?

That's ridiculous.

Well at least brake
in the brim a little.

Nuh uh, it's my hat.

I paid for it.

(phone ringing)

Yo.

This isn't over.

So how's it going?

[Stewart] Holy crap.

That bad huh?

No no no no.

That good.

They love me.

Really?

Well you don't have
to sound so surprised.

[Colin] I'm not.

[Stewart] I know, I know.

It's just the first day.

But I had this great
meeting with the dean.

He has read all my
stuff which was surreal.

That's great.

[Stewart] Right?

And then, this afternoon
I'm just touring the campus

and I get hit by this
cute professor from

the history department--

Maybe the universe is
trying to tell me something.

Did you just say the universe?

Oh God.

One day and I'm already
talking like them.

Mention kale and I'm
sending out a rescue party.

[Stewart] Please
send the hit squad.

Now listen, I'm meeting
history department for a drink.

Um, I gotta go.

Tomorrow is meetings,
meetings, meetings.

And then some big dinner thing.

But I'll call when I can.

Oh, okay.

Talk to you then.

Glad it's--

Something wrong?

Hmm?

Oh, no no, just...

(exhales heavily)

Stu.

Another round?


Sure.

(train honking)

[Tee] A half an hour
north of Ashville.

Near the Tennessee line.

Sounds rustic.

Yeah.

You know, I grew up
right here, Carnegie Mellon

faculty brat.

Yeah, I know.

I think some of the--

Look at that ball control!

Come on.

How can you not love basketball?

Why, because I'm black?

Shut it, jackass.

Because you're from
North Carolina.

Dean Smith, Coach K,
Michael fuckin' Jordan?

Pops wasn't too big
on extracurriculars.

Took too much time
out of bible study.

Wait, seriously?

Yes sir.

Stop that.

Wow, so your dad's...

pretty religious.

Um, I was raised
by my grandparents.

But, yeah, Pentecostal.

[Colin] Yeesh.

No snakes or nothing.

People always ask
about that but...

it's still pretty hardcore.

Are your parents...

Yeah, in a car wreck.

I was three.

I don't remember anything.

[Colin] I'm sorry.

So, does your grandfather

know you're gay?

Oh, yeah.

He caught me and my best friend,

you know.

Oh shit.


He used to pray over me.

Like a lot.

Out saying, "Leave this boy."

It's pretty intense.

I told him I was
healed once but...

Then he caught us again.


Sorry to laugh.

I'm sorry.

[Tee] Program's great
but, I just transferred.

I'm gay, I'm black.

I talk different.

That's gotta be tough.

No, everyone's
super nice, just...

I don't know,
sometimes I feel like

I'm a pet alien or something.

Phone home.

What?

Pet alien like E.T..

Oh, like the movie.

I've never really seen it.

We didn't.

Come on.

With Elliott and E.T.
and what's her name--

Drew Barrymore?

The bicycle chase and
they start flying?

No?

It sounds cool.

It's from the 80s right?

Oh shit.

Never mind.

Ouch.

So you feel like an alien.

But do you think your
classmates really

view you that way?

Or is that--

Oh.

I'm sorry.

What?

I don't mean to grill you.

Hazard of the job.

Every conversation
is an interview.

You'll see.

What's your favorite color?

My...

I'm practicing my
interview skills.

Favorite color?

[Colin] That's your
opening question?

Favorite color?

(both chuckling)

Wow, I smell a Pulitzer.

Favorite color?

Blue.

Cats or dogs?

Neither.

Not that I don't like them.

I just can't be around them.

Allergic.

Me too.

Like my eyes start swelling up

and I can't stop sneezing.

Exactly.

Um, hang on.

I gotta...



Sorry about that.

I've enjoyed hanging
out with you.

Thaddeus Bloom.

Yeah, me too.

Oh.

Shit.

Did I?

No it's--

Oh...

Shit!

What the fuck am I doing?

Colin it's okay.

No fuck!
Don't!

Oh fuck!

What is wrong with me?

Colin?
No.

Listen.

Tee, this is my fault.

I'm sorry.

You're an intern.

It's okay.
No!

Tee, it's not.

You should go.

What?

Just go!

Forget Lockwood.
We shouldn't be--

Oh fuck!

I--
No!

Just stay away from me.

I mean it!

Stay away!

(train bell chiming)

(zipper unzipping)

(low suspenseful music)

Hey.

[Tee] Hey.

I couldn't figure
out the coffee maker.

It took me a week.

The manual's like War and Peace.

Did you shower?

Nah, I have to change
before work anyway.

I shower at the dorm.

Dorm.

Oh Christ.

Tee, um.

Listen, uh.

Last night...

I think this might be--

Your place is really cool.

Oh.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Just like grandma made.

(phone dial)

[Voiceover] Hi, this is
Professor Stewart Wisniewski

and this is my
personal voicemail.

If you're calling about
office hours please call my--

(phone beep)

(high intensity
electronic music)

[Colin] Wow, this
brings back memories.

Never mind.

Fine, when I was a
senior in high school

I used to fool
around with this guy

on the fourth floor,
Kevin, Kevin--

Oh shit.

I don't think I ever
knew his last name.

Oh gee, that's real
classy Mr. Role Modal.

Oh wait.

You have to wait a minute.

Tee, don't worry about it.

You should have seen how
messy I was in college.

Drove Stu nuts.

No, just wait here okay?

Okay.

What room?

313.

All right.

Okay.

You can come in now.

Wow.

Stu would approve.

Well...

I always had to
clean my room or else.

Why'd you transfer?

Just, distance.

As in you needed some?

Tee, why do you have this?

Pops sent it.

Why would you keep it?

Oh.

Babe.

This is going.

(moaning and grunting)

Put her on hold.

* Well I'm, self absorbed

* and sex obsessed

* I enjoy the excess

* I'm a fun little mess

* I got the knowledge

* but I failed the test

* I came second best

* like all of the rest

* self indulged
and self inflicted

* every word I say
may be contradicted

* Now I'm laid out on my f--

You're early.

Oh, yeah.

I got a flight out this morning.

And now I can't find my key.

I need to get the spare.

Oh, right.

Hey, that smells good.

Have you got enough for two?

The airline charged
me eight bucks

for a so called
snack box containing

the most baffling
assortment of crap.

Uh no, sorry.

So it turns out this trip
was a fucking waste of time.

Shocker.

I thought it was going well?

Ah, it was going
well until I--

Um, hello.

Not enough for two.

Okay.

Sorry.

Oh my God you're blushing.

I am not.

Look at you.

You're blushing.

Who is it?

And how do I not know this?

(door bell buzzing)

Shit.

You have to go.

Okay.

But you have got to promise...

to go easy.

It's Tee.

No, the intern?

Come on, now don't get all--
[Stewart] Oh Jesus Colin.

You know your little
fetish for post collegiates

is bad enough but
come on he's a fetus.

I know, I know, but...

He's smart and...

Kind of fascinating.

He's got this totally
fucked up background.

I mean fucked.

Up.

Look, why don't you
stay for dinner?

Talk to him and you'll see.

Or, you can tell
me that I'm crazy

because seriously I feel
like a teenager here.

Well that makes two of you.

(door bell buzzing)

He's 21.

Colin, he's an employee.

Okay, technically he
doesn't report to me.

He's Shar's intern.

Really, that's what
you're going with?

I can't decide if this is
funny or just pathetic.

(door bell buzzing)
Be nice.

Well I'll try but
I make no promises.

Hey!

Hi.

Tee, you remember Stu?

He's gonna be joining
us for dinner.

Oh.

[Colin] You're shitting me.

[Stewart] Oh I shit you not.

Cut his fingernails
during the interview.

[Colin] What an asshole.

Well he was Hal Tate's
roommate at Princeton so...

So, that explains it.

Who?

Doesn't matter.

You know, I had actually
forgotten about that.

Hal Tate was George's mentor

when he taught at Georgetown.

So isn't that a good thing?

Stu started getting
more attention

and Tate didn't--

We got into a pissing contest

and his dick was bigger, okay?

Moving on.

Anyway, it's beside the
point because they're also

talking to Patricia
Braxton Hall.

[Tee] Who?

(silverware slammed)

[Colin] Stewart, I'm
not even sure who that is.

The Black Ann Coulter.

Oh.

Her.

She's a piece of work.

She is appalling
but she's smart

and she's a diversity wet dream.

Can use the computer?

I'm sorry babe.

We just had a lot
to catch up on.

It's okay.

Can I use it?

You didn't like
the cacciatore?

No, I'm not that hungry.

Want me to make
you a sandwich?

No, I'm good.

[Colin] Take the
laptop by the bed.

Want me to make
you a sandwich?

[Colin] Shut it.

(exhales deeply)

(breathes frantically)

(suspenseful slow music)

Hey.

Oh, uh, sorry.

[Tee] Use the damn doorbell!

(doorbell buzzing)

What are you saying man?

You're anti-gay marriage?

No, I'm not saying
that at all but,

let's be honest, it's
a tradition designed

to foster procreation
in a specific way.

With a dominant husband
and a subservient wife.

So, how is that a useful model
for homosexual relationships?

Not even straight people
but that shit anymore.

There are legal rights
that come with marriage, man.

It' not just about procreation.

There's not fertility
requirement.

Sterile people can
still get married.

Oh and I wish they would.

We're being treated
differently under the law.

Civil rights.

Now there I agree with you.

Marriage may be a farce but

we should have
equal access to it.

You just like to argue.

You're catching on.

Whatever.

I gotta pee.

Well golly, thanks
for the update.

What?

I can tell you like him.

Well let's not
get carried away.

Fine.

He is very right
for a sixth grader.

Happy?

Delighted.

Is that all he's eating?

Wasting bacon, that's
just wrong. (phone chiming)

(screaming) Show time!

Babe!

[Mike] Greetings
Pittsburghers.

I'm Mike Steinman.

[Colin] And I'm
Colin McCormack.

And this is the
Pittsburgh Pulse.

Thanks for sharing
your Saturday with us.

[Mike] This week we're
taking a closer look

at the state of renewable
energy in Pennsylvania.

Is it for real?

Or just a lot of expensive
wishful thinking?

[Colin] Like Mike's
gym membership.

[Mike] Exactly.

[Colin] Our guest today
are Patty Hickenlooper,

Executive Director of the
Green States Initiative,

and Republican State
Senator George Winston.

But first let's take a look--

(typing on keyboard)

There you are.

Tee, it's okay.

You know you can use it.

Can't sleep again?

So what have we got here?

at porn aren't you?

Let me see.

Let me see.

No!

Hey, where did you
get that picture?

You friended my dad?

You're account was logged on.

I just kind of--

Tee, that's not...

When you talk about him
he sounds really cool.

Yeah.

I'm lucky.

I know.


I was so young.

I was so proud of that fish.

Dad made me feel like
I'd landed a great white.

What else we have in here?

Wow.

It's after we won
state championship.

Junior year.

Oh.

I love that one.

Stu and me, commencement day.

See, he does smile.

That's...

Christmas in Aspen 90...

Six?

97, does it say?

Why is Stu there?

He usually does the
holidays with my folks.

His dad's a marine.

Super conservative.

And an asshole.

Plus...

His mom kind of drinks.

But you guys were never...

No.

I mean, we fooled around
some in college but...

No.

He's my best friend.

Okay.

I need to get some sleep.

Come on.

Or maybe just get some.

(car honking)

(doorbell buzzing)

Can we go now?

Come on Babe!

[Colin] So maybe you
can help me prep on

the constitutional arguments.

Yeah sure, I can pull
some stuff together.

I can do it.

(chuckles) Thanks
Babe, but I think

this is more Stu's bailiwick.

[Stu] Chipotle maple syrup.

That's perverse.

No, it's just different.

Try it.

[Voiceover] Tee!

Hey Cat!

[Cat] How the hell you been?

Oh my gosh!

Colin McCormack.

I love your show.


And you...

Such a hottie.

Why thank you, gorgeous.


You keep giving
that Steinman hell.

I will.

I promise.

Who's your daddy?

Is the irony of that
completely lost on you?

Huh?

Shut it.

I mean, I will concede
he's not your usual

frat boy type but
I'm not used to your

little conquests hanging
around like this.

Stewart...

He's not a little conquest.

I really think I...

I don't know.

Maybe, the Greeks
were on to something.

You know that older
younger thing?

Please, those stories
never ended well.

Someone was always
stabbing out their eyes

or getting chained to a rock.

Just ease up a bit.

Please.

Fine.

Does he...

Look thin to you?

Oh God.

[Lockwood] There
is no such thing

as a gay child.

If a young person tells you that

what they are saying is
they have embraced Satan.

You do not love that.

You do not accept that.

You cannot accept that.

You must fight the Devil.

And you must make that
young person understand

the evil in the--

[Colin] Tee.

You okay?

(mumbling yes)

So...

We tape tomorrow.

What have we got?

I pulled a bunch of stuff

but it's all variations
on the same thing.

Damn.

There's this
from the Inquirer.

No, I don't think we
want to go down that route.

Shit.

Well, we tried.

Colin, I'm sorry.

Hey.

Don't worry.

You did great.

Really.

Maybe there's a
reason no one can--

Tee?

I'm heading out now.

Don't stay too late.

We were just (clears throat)

Doing some stuff for
tomorrow's Pulse episode.

Okay.

He's not working
you too hard is he?

[Tee] No ma'am.

All righty then.

Good night.

Have a good night.

Mhmm.

Tee!

Tee, Jesus Babe, we--

We just, we need to
be more careful here.

Okay?

Okay?

My place at seven.

We'll go for a run.

(Colin complaining of pain)

Sorry.

Didn't even see it.

Fuckin' rat on a leash.

Damn.

I really scraped it.

I'll get the peroxide.

(door slamming)
Stewart!

What?

Oh Christ.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Ding dong.

Holy crap.

You should put some
peroxide on that.

We know.

Why are you in such a tizzy?

She said no.

Who?

Braxton Hall.

At the last minute,
decided she didn't want to

make her kids change
schools or something.

So, does that mean...

They just called.

Wow.

That's...

Well done my friend.

Congratulations.

Tee, congratulations
are in order.

Stewart got the job.

Really?

That's awesome.

When do you go?

I haven't actually said yes.

You...

Honestly, I thought
it was a lost cause.

I told them I'd have
to think about it.

What do you think I should do?

You're asking me?

[Stewart] Yeah.

Well, I tell you what...

We're going to
dinner at Pablo's.

Why don't you come with us and--

(complaining of pain)

Babe, careful please.

Sorry.

All done.

Colin, I could really
use your advice on this.

Does he have to--

Um, can you take a
rain check on dinner

just this once?

No!

Seriously?
Colin!

Jesus.

Fine, how is this,

Stu, let's go grab a drink.

Talk it through.

And then, Tee can
join for dinner.

Great.

What's my time allotment?

Babe, would it be okay if--

Whatever.

I got some stuff I
can do at the dorm.

You sure?

Yeah.

Okay.

Thanks.

Come here.

Did you see that
look he just shot me?

You're being too sensitive.

Uh huh.

(door slammed)

He's--

He's not sleeping.

I think he's just tired.

Well then get him some Ambien.

Or better yet, a shrink.

Because I'm telling you,

there is something not
right about this kid.

Look.

I know Tee's a little intense.

I'm not an idiot.

But I like the fact
that he needs me.

That I...

Feel I can take care of him.

Well that's just sweet.

But don't you feel--

I called empathy Stewart!

I know it's not your thing.

Not my thing?

Don't you get tired of it?

Keeping the world
at arms length.

That's what you do, you know.

So this is about me?

Yeah, it is.

'Cause you can't stand the fact

that I found someone.

Someone I actually care about.

You know why?

'Cause it means you
might actually have

to find your own life.

Instead of glomming onto mine.

You think that I--

Oh my God, you're ego is just--

Fuck you.

Fuck you.

Just, fuck you.

I am out of here.

Enjoy your empathy.

You know I'm right!

(door slammed)

Stewart!

Fuck.

(solemn piano music)


(elevator dinging)

Hey Amber, is Colin in--

Hello!

Yeah, hi.

So is he--

What?

Hey buddy!

Reverend Lockwood.

I'm Amber Fletcher.

We spoke on the phone.

The pleasure is all mine.

Hi. I'm Irvin Lockwood.

Hi, I'm gay.

He in his office?

I am so sorry about that.

He's not with the show.

Please, follow me.

I don't know what I'm supposed

to do with this now.

You couldn't make bullet points?

Yeah well excuse me
for being thorough.

We got him!

Calm down Tee.

Just read it.

Stu can you give us a second?

Uh, yeah.

Sure.

Tee.

What is this?

Did you see what he
says about her pussy?

Where did you get this?

This is Lockwood's
personal email.

Where did you get it?

Did somebody give this to you?

Holy shit!

Tee, don't they
teach you ethics?

We can't use this!

But that's proof--

Enough!

I just thought--

I can't deal with
this right now.

[Stewart] What the
hell was that all about?

Is everything all right?

Don't.
Okay.

Just don't.

[Tee] Hey, I got you!
[Amber] Tee!

You hear me?

You're a fucking hypocrite

and I got you!

[Lockwood] You better
get out of my face!

Take a step back.

[Lockwood's body guard] Hey!

You hear the man.

Back off!

[Tee] A fucking hypocrite!

(loud thump)

(people screaming)

[Voiceover] Oh my God!

Shit!

Call 911!

Honey, are you okay?

I barely pushed him.

Tee, can you hear me?

I don't think you
should move him.

That boy was out of control

You saw.

Somebody call 911!

What the hell happened?

Babe, it'll be okay.

[Voiceover] Fifth floor.

He's not moving.

(suspenseful music)

(phone ringing)

Yo.

[Colin] Any luck tracking
down the grandparents?

No, his...

Phone and computer are
password protected and...

Anyway I don't think they're
very big correspondents.

Listen Colin, I'm
gonna come get you.

[Colin] No, Tee's awake but
they've gotta run some tests

before they'll release him.

We'll just cab it
back to my place.

Okay, but Colin I--

[Colin] Hang on,
here comes the doctor.

I gotta go.

Easy.

I'm fine.

Babe.

Hey.

Hey.

Give me a hand?

I'm fine.

I just need to sit down.

He's got a concussion.

Look after him.

I gotta pay the cab.

Yeah.

I think I get it.

I really think I do.

I mean...

I've barely spoken to my father

in almost 20 years, you know?

And before that, well...

So I understand.

Growing up without
that connection.

It hurts, I know.

What do you want?

He has to know.

Fuck you!

Tee, you have got to tell him.

Tell who what?

Colin, I'm just going to--

[Colin] Sit!

Why are you upsetting him?

Everything's okay.

We just have to talk.

That's all.

Right, Tee?

Right?

Tee?

Is there something you...

Need to tell me?

Babe, it's okay.

You know you can
tell me anything.


What is this?

When you donated,

you gave them permission
to release your identity

to any results.

I know but why...

I mean.

Oh my God.

Did your mom...

Are you?

Oh God.

Oh God, what have we done?

Colin--

Don't.

Get the fuck off me!

Okay.

Hey, just calm down.

He's my son!

And you knew?

No Colin, I just--

Colin, please.

You let me fuck you!

I thought it was worth it!

Worth what?!

Are you insane?!

Colin!

Get him out of here.

When I get back I
want both of you gone.

(door slams)


Oh hey!
Hey.

Hey stop that.

Tee, damn it.

Stop.

(crying uncontrollably)

Stop that.
Stop it.

Jesus.
Stop that.

Stop it.



(high intensity
suspenseful music)

(doorbell buzzing)

Colin!

(knocking on door)

[Stewart] Colin?

(doorbell buzzing)

(loud rock music)

Colin, can I come in?

Colin.

Colin.

Can I come in?

(loud rock music)


I waited my whole life.

To know.

My dad.

Just wanted to be near him.

So why didn't
you just tell him?

Before.

I didn't know how he'd react.

He didn't need to
know who I was.

I just...

Wanted him to like me.

It was going so good, you know.

Working together.

Then he kissed me and
got all freaked out.

I thought I cold just...

But...

Jesus.

It's all fucked up, isn't it?

Yeah Tee, it is.

It's...

It's pretty fucked up.

I want you to talk to someone.

Professional.

Okay?

Yeah.

I mean it.

Do you need me to help
you find someone or...

They got em at student health.

Good.

(voice machine beep)

[Colin's boss]
Colin, listen um,

Christ, you better come

to the conference room.

Now, okay.

[Voiceover] This
isn't necessary stuff?

It's what this is.

Permanent.

Sully--

Mr. McCormack, thank you.

Please, take a seat.

[Colin's boss]
So Colin, this here

is Mr. Hanson from legal.

Apparently we got
a situation here.

Save it Al.

I quit.

[Hanson] Mr. McCormack,
we're only proposing

a suspension.

(doorbell buzzing)

These are yours.

Colin, you can keep
them if you want.

No.

Come in?

Please.

I could use the company.

Packing is so fucking boring.

Do you want something to drink?

Got any beer?

Oh, I can look.

Colin, I'm pretty
sure this bowl--

(door shutting)

* Where did you come from

* The moment we met

* You had me spinning

* When you took my hand

* Sound the alarms

* You caught me off guard

* As fast as you came

* Then you were gone

* You string me along

* With your empty promises

* You just keep me hanging on

* You keep me hanging on

* You keep me hanging on

* You gotta let me go

* Just a hangman on your own

(phone vibrating)

* I can't breathe

* And I can't sleep

* You leave me here
and I'm wondering

* I don't know where
we stand anymore

* You're gone

* You come to me

* You move away

* You're here last night

* But you're gone today

* You make me feel that it's
wrong for me to want more

* You tell me you miss
me and then wonder why

* When I give you nothing
[Voiceover] Are you okay?

* I leave in a spot

* Well why should I

(indistinguishable singing)

(doorbell buzzing)

[Mike] See what I mean folks,

these liberals have
no sense of humor.

(door slamming)

Colin, what the fuck.

Your voicemail is full.

You don't answer email.

Are you...

Colin, I don't know
what to do here.

Nobody's asking
you to do anything.

Go back to L.A.

So Tee's gotten
himself expelled.

Pills and some...

Altercations.

A social worker thinks he needs

some in-patient treatment

and I can't stomach
them shipping him off

to that whack job
grandfather so...

UCLA Medical has a program.

We're on the 6 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

The way he would...

Look at me.

What?

He would...

Look at me like...

He wanted to consume me.

And I wanted that.

I wanted...

Something.

More, but I got it wrong.

He wanted a father.

He needed me to be a father.

And I made him--

Colin you didn't know.

I knew it was wrong.

On some level I
knew it wasn't...

What he wanted.

But he let happen.

And you can't take
that on yourself.

He made a choice.

He got scared

and he made a fucked up choice

that we are all
gonna have to find

some way to live with.

Especially Tee.

Who are you?

I don't get it.

You're being so gentle with him.

I don't know.

He's a good kid.

Incredibly fucked up but...

He's never had anyone looking
out for him, you know.

And I remember what
that felt like.

How alone I felt.

Anyway.

Yup.

Listen, I need to
make sure he's packed

and ready to go.

He's staying with me
at the hotel tonight.

I know he'd love to see you.

I can't.

Colin, you have got to just--

No I don't.

I really don't.

You are--

You're unbelievable.

Not everything is
easy, you know, life.

I know you've managed
to go 40 odd years

without having to
face that little fact,

but I never expected this.

Things get shitty
and you just quit.

Really?

Who are you?

(door slammed)

[Mike] And of course
you can follow our columns

Tuesdays and Thursdays
in the Times Herald.

Until next time,
I'm Mike Steinman.

And I'm Colin
McCormack on The Pulse.

And I'm Colin McCormack on The--

And I'm Colin
McCormack on The Pulse.

And I'm Colin McCormack.

(uplifting guitar music)

[Voicemail] Hey there,
this is Kin Cheng, KCLA News.

Listen, we were
impressed with your reel

and the timing couldn't
have been better.

We got something
coming up pretty quick.

So give me a call
as soon as possible

and I'll fill you
in on the details.

Okay.

I look forward to
talking to you.

My number is 323-526...

Mr. McCormack?

Well, I've discussed
it with my colleagues.

And?

Well, frankly
a little heads up

would've been appreciated.

We'd like to really discuss
this with Tee before hand.

You understand this is...

Complicated?

Yeah.

Yeah, it is.

We have a group
session starting shortly.

I'll ask you to keep
it simple today.

Just, stick to the basics.

Just, reconnect.

And then perhaps you
can come back tomorrow

for a more in depth session.

Would that work?

I'll follow your lead here.

Thank you.

I'll be right back.

You're here.

I am.

I'm glad.

(knock on door)

Hello.

Oh hi, is this--

Are you looking for Stewart?

Yeah.

Can I tell him--

You're Colin right?

I am.

You are...

Paul, hi.

Hey hon, who is it?

Well now.

Surprised?

You think?

Paul, this is Colin.

I recognized him.

He did.

So...

I'm not interrupting, am I?

No no, not at all.

Actually, you are
saving me 'cause Stewart

is determined to make
me a basketball fan

and it is not taking.

You're not trying.

Whatever.

Listen, I should
really be working

on my lesson plans anyway.

So, why don't I leave
you two boys to catch up.

You sure?

Of course.

Okay, thanks hon.

Yeah.

I'll call you later?

That's perfect.

It's nice to meet you.

Likewise.

So was that
History Department?

Seems like a good guy.

He is.

Does he live here, or?

No, but...

He is a good guy.

Oh my God.

I know right

So what are you doing here?

I've been a jackass.

I am not gonna argue.

You okay?

Getting there.

Yeah.

Good.

Tee's doing better.

I can get you the
number of the--

I already saw him.

We're gonna--

Keep talking.

Stewart,

Why did, why did you
move to Pittsburgh?

Jesus Colin, it was
15 years ago, I can't--

Stewart.

That's where the job was.

Okay, no.

The shit storm at
Georgetown wore me out.

And I missed my friend.

I missed you too.

I know I never said that.

We're masters at
not saying things.

We're pathetic.

I'm pathetic.

So let me--

Say this.

Having you in my life

has meant the world to me.

You,

you are my family.

You bastard, you know
I feel the same way.

Our son had some issues.


So I got a meeting with
the CW affiliate here.

They're looking for
a weekend anchor.

You think I might
like California?

Yeah, I do.

I do?

What, are we married now?

Oh, shut it.

I'm spoken for.

[Sport's announcer]
How about that one?

He looked like a freight
train out of control

but it was all net.

Wow.

One of the highlights
of the night so far.

And there have been
plenty of them.

Fantastic.

In case you missed
it, the Tigers...

[Colin] I feel old.

[Stewart] Yeah.

[Colin] Well.

(soft rock music)
