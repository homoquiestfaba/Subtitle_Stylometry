Hi Cedric, it's your boo, Gia.

I just wanted to say good morning.

Yo baby, I'm trying to catch mad Z's right now,

I'm gonna hit you back in a few hours.

[Gia] Okay, toodles.

My girlfriend Gia always calling when I'm dreaming

about my ex-girlfriend Marika.

But I'll tell y'all more about that later on.

â™ª What your girl don't know

Mama! Hey, I'm naked and I'm trying to take a doo doo.

Boy please, you ain't have no clothes on

when I gave your ass life.

Now hurry up and get out of here, get downstairs

and help your father load that car, and I mean now!

(loud slam)

Boy, you know you got decent clothes upstairs.

Why you come out of the house looking like this?

And where are your shoes?

Hurry up, boy, I been waiting on your ass for 20 minutes.

Sorry about that pop, what you need?

I want you to put them bags in the back.

Okay, you've been waiting down here for 20 minutes

and you already brought the bags out?

How come you didn't just put them in the trunk?

Cause you need to do some work.

Cedric, now you know your daddy got a bad back.

Just get over here and put these bags in the car,

and quit questioning him.

What you talking about?

I ain't got no bad back.

Well it's not a newsflash,

you've had a bad back for years now.

Well, you weren't complaining about that last night

when I threw your ass in the froggy style position,

now was you? (laughs)

Well you do have tendency to rise to the occasion.

Yes, I do. (both laughing)

(Cedric clears throat)

(Cedric coughing)

(record scratching)

Come on, man, what's wrong with you?

I want the lawn mowed, the house clean,

and most importantly I want that backyard straightened up,

especially the pool.

And don't have none of them two-bit ho's

you be messing around with up in here while I'm gone.

What about two-bit hoochie mama's, is that cool?

Boy, you want me to knock you into the middle of November?

Only if it's the 15th, that's the only time

y'all seem to buy grocery these days.

Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding pops, just kidding.

Now look here boy, I know you're in your last semester

of college, so you a man now.

Be responsible, okay?

Cause if you are, as a graduation gift,

I might be able work something out on that

93 Jeep that you want.

For reals?


That's right, son, that's right.

I know how you feel,

you're a horny little motherfucker all the time.

So if you wanna get your little booty thing going,

after you finish your work, you better carry your ass

to a motel or to the back of someone's car.

Don't have my place smelling like ass,

'cause the only person allowed to

pop coochie in that castle, is this king.

Got it?

(car horn honking)

Woman, stop honking that horn at me, goddammit.

Can't you see me here conversating man to man to my son?

Shit,a woman will drive a man crazy.

Nag you to death, make you wanna commit suicide,

or homicide.

Look boy, if you wanna have one,

two of your homeboys over, that's fine, but no parties.

Don't worry pop, I won't let you down.

Oh no no, you won't let me down.

You'll let yourself down,

and your mama down,

and that pretty little Jeep down.

If you need anything, I left the number to where

we gonna be staying on the fridge.

And in case of an emergency I left 911's number too.

â™ª Platinum tie ho

â™ª You know ghetto fabulous

â™ª Got you all curious baby,

â™ª But you ain't gotta have a lot of money to be â™ª

Cedrick!

Hi!

What's up Ro? You join the nation?

Sho enough my brother, the most positive move

I have ever made in my life.

Looky here.

I want to give you your props on the shindig that you

have put together today my brother.

Black folk coming together united, it's beautiful!

Thanks man.

My only concern is the menu.

Say it isn't so that you're serving barbecued pork ribs.

Don't you know pork is like a drug killing the black man?

Heart attacks, high blood pressure, impulse tense,

pre-ejaculation,

car jacking,

gang violence

black on black crime.

All a result of eating pork.

So Cedrick, are you gonna contribute to

the conspiracy by the white man

to bring down the black man by serving this

shit the blue-eyed-devil call pork?

Yeah, well actually I was

just in charge of inviting the peoples.

Now Geeter, he's in charge of the menu.

He's the chef today, so you might wanna holler at him.

And you know,

he's right over there at the barbecue grill brother Shabazz.

â™ª Oh yes

â™ª We're feeling good and also blessed â™ª

â™ª Today gon' be a good day

â™ª Not settling for less

â™ª So when mom's get up on that early morning stressing â™ª

â™ª No sooner than she finish her lesson â™ª

â™ª I'm dressing

â™ª Ready to carry on

Smoking that shit all the time, man...

Oh shit!

What the hell?

Get yo shit before I burn it.

The Q ain't ready yet, man?

How much longer?

You need to tighten your shit up Saskwatch!

You shouldn't be worried about the Q.

You need to be worrying

about your mouth and your head okay!


I finally figured out why you always cracking on me.

Cause you the picture of after birth?

Cause I won't break you with none of this.

You better get away from me with that!


Man fuck ya'll!

Get away from me you, you, you.

Whatever you is!

I don't know why you tripping Geeter, I know you want me.

But that's all right.

Get away from me with that bullshit!

You see that?

She's got the hots for you!

Shit man! Naw, naw!

(hip hop music)

Yo Big Nig wake up!

Big Nig! Yo Big nig!

(water splashing)

What you do that for Ced?

Cause your big ass wouldn't wake up.

Get off me!

Yo, I need you to get out the pool for a minute,

Ranisha want to get in.

Well that's cool, I got room for baby on the raft.

Man she wanna take a swim and she can't do that with your

big old ass sprawled out like Shamu.

Come on man I'm comfortable.

Come on Big Nig man, just for a little bit.

Yo, besides dog, I think the hotdog's are ready.

For real?

(water splashing)

â™ª Wild Irish Rose killing all you ho's â™ª

â™ª Rebut you so and I blow through the red lights â™ª

â™ª You dead rise and you knew that â™ª

â™ª Go through hell so you can tell what land like, â™ª

â™ª Buckin your homies they phoney y'all make the mud splash â™ª

â™ª Bullets ricochet off the bodies â™ª

In order to rise as a people, we must be on the same page

my brother, we must consume the same food my brother.

A minimum of one deans power day is mandatory.

Brothers who are eating pork are contributing to the

conspiracy to bring down our people.

If you are eating pork, you must stop it.

That means you can't fuck around with no more ham.

No ham hock, no chitlings, no bacon and no more neck bone.

You must sever yourself from the pig completely.

Hey hey hey hey, does that include SPAM?

(slow soulful music)

Oh this is just scorching today.

It's hot in here and, and Robin slow this thing down.

Turn this music off, I can't even hear myself think.

[Robin] Woman dammit... - Get off at the next exit

I gotta pee.

Look at them rocking.

I ain't looking at anything right now but your black ass.

Did you hear what I said? I got to pee.

Viola dammit you gotta wait. I'm making record time.

Did you hear what my sister said?

Stop at the next exit and let her use the bathroom.

Hell naw!

â™ª How do I tell her that I miss her â™ª

â™ª That I want her back

â™ª That I want her to come my way again â™ª

â™ª Man I don't know

â™ª I just don't know man

â™ª What to do

â™ª Thinking back to better days

â™ª And the way we used to be

â™ª I reminisce kissing your lips, â™ª

â™ª Rubbing your hips, ecstasy

â™ª Me for you and you for me

â™ª That's the way it went down

â™ª And now you're not around

â™ª I wonder why

Damn, I heard you had fine ass Shea

in the bedroom and you didn't even hit it.

True that, true that!

What?

Oh man, tell me the reason why

you didn't hit Shea is cause

you still strung on that bitch Marika?

Nigga don't call her no bitch!

And no, I'm not sprung.

Please, by the way them veins is bulging out your neck

I'd say you's jealous as a motherfucker right about now.

Jealous of what?

That fool Rolando?

Come on man that

nigga look like a broke ass Martin Lawrence.


[Geeter] Yeah? All right man.

See we your boys, you gotta tell us something.

I mean shit, you didn't hit Gia,

nor did you hit Shea nigga.

And if your ass is keeping that shit real secretive

then you ain't had no nana,

since you broke with that bitch Marika.

Either your ass is still sprung as a motherfucker.

Or you just one of them gay type niggas.

All right man.

There's a reason why I didn't hit Shea earlier today.

I'm about to break it down for you niggas.

[Big Nig] Better be good motherfucker!

[Cedrick] You remember this morning

when we was chilling on the porch?

Oh shit, here come fine ass Shea!

What's up Shea, hi what you doing up here?

Oh she came to see me. - [Shea] Beep beep!

I paged you last night but you didn't call me back

[Delron] Sho nuff! - [Geeter] Most valuable pussy

You up here acting like Bill Cosby.

Shit like, I don't want the booty.

I don't want the booty, give me the jello pudding.

[Cedrick] What ya'll ain't know

[Shea] Oh Cedrick!

Yes!

Oh Cedrick! Oh Cedrick!

(high pitched moaning)

[Cedrick] Ooh, what's my name?

That's it!

I think I can, I think I can, I know I can!

I know I can, I know I can, I know I can!


(simultaneous moaning)

(random piano melody)


(piano melody continues)

[Cedrick] We did the freak nasty four days in a row.

But after each time

there was a odor of stankiness in the air.

â™ª We just have to do

â™ª Our thing

â™ª To get this going

â™ª Further further further further further â™ª

Now the stankiness turned out to be baby's panties.

They had skid marks the size of Compton.

â™ª My lusting thirsting

Now there was dookie crumbs on the couch,

dookie crumbs on my jimmy,

dookie crumbs in the hall,

dookie crumbs on the wall.

There was enough shit in that house

to make a dookie pot pie.

I got my shit and I left.

So ever since I left Shea's house that day,

I never looked at her with a romantic eye again.

I mean being the gentleman I am I never brought the shit up.

No pun intended.

Since then she been jocking.

Bringing me cookies, cupcakes,

calling me every hour on the hour,

paging me 24/7, the whole nine.

That's deep Ced.

I mean I heard some fine females have some stank pussy,

but I ain't never heard nothing like this.

Man, please let me tell you something.

A bitch that fine can shit on me, and I'll still eat

the pussy I'll be like.

(disgusted groans)

[Geeter] Be chewing it down like a motherfucker!

What's up with that big ass Kool-Aid smile Delron?

Man I just got done tearing Latoya's ass up!

That motherfucker be chilling now.

Gave her one of them super sperms man, made the girl

go in convulsions and shit.

I was in there tearing it up.

I was like,

I was like,

I was like, Nigga- what?

Doo Doo Brown! Doo Doo Brown!

Man, please!

You're so damn whipped it's pathetic.

Man I ain't whipped, if anything I got her sprung,

from tearing up that punani!

Well look here, I ain't trying to start nothing.

But Craig told Jimmy,

that Bill told Clinton

that they told

Latoya that you can't fuck!

What?

Yeah, yeah that's right.

She said fucking you was so boring

she'd rather have an enema.

(background cackling)

At least she can feel that shit.


Hey yo, looks like Latoya still horny.

[Geeter] Word.

Hey I might gon' have to hit that shit there.

[Cedrick] Go on handle your business!

[Geeter] Go on over there!

Dalmatian shirt, ashy son of a bitch!

Hey look ya'll I'm going back to the grill.

Imma cook up some shit.

Have me another blunt!


Hurry your ass up, before your burn the food nigga.

Yo G, can I keep you company?

[Geeter] Bring your big ass over!

Yo, and use the pool sparingly Big Nig.

â™ª Jump off the death cliff,

â™ª Bungee with the gift swift

â™ª Facts not a myth

I wanna talk about it now.

Latoya, I know we've been doing it all the time,

but we really never talked about the matter.

So I guess I just wanna confirm what I already know,

you know what I'm saying?

No I don't!

What are you saying Delron?

Like this morning,

when we was having sex in your guest bedroom's house.

You know, when we was doing the booty bump, butt naked.

Did you cum?

Did I cum?

Did you climax?

I mean, it's not a trick question, Latoya.

This is a barbecue Delron.

I don't think this is the time

or place to be talking about our sex life.

Oh, come on Latoya.

I just wanna confirm what I already know.

What is that?

That I'm the greatest of all time!

You wanna know the truth?

Yeah, I'm a man. You know, give it to me raw.

Don't sugar coat the shit for me.

Well no, I did not have an orgasm.

You didn't?

Did I stutter?

That's cool, you know?

I mean, men can't get off all the time.

You know what I'm saying?

Well, look, look,

when we was in your cousins father's bedroom bathroom

floors, you, you came then right?

Well that goes to say

you know you the best pussy I've sho' nuff ever had.

I'm sho' nuff the best dick you've ever had right?

Right?

Oh shit Latoya!

If I ain't the best dick you've ever had,

who in the hell is?

[Delron] You're kidding me!

That fat roly poly motherfucker?

Oh, ya'll two were never an item!

Look before me and you got together,

Big Nig and I hooked up for a few booty calls.

Now that nigga is the bomb!

That shit raw, black!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Hey, we can go without the play by play okay.

Thank you!

Look out of all the motherfuckers a girl been with.

Where does a nigga rank?

Shit Delron, let's not go there.

No, we started this shit, now we gon' finish.

All right, out of 28 lovers...

You've been with 28 niggas?

25 niggas, one Puerto Rican

and two Mexicans.

Damn that's a lot of motherfuckers!

And I have to say you rank...

28.

Well it's not like it's your fault.

I mean, you really weren't given much to work with.

I mean the first time I saw your dick,

I said damn that shit look like a navel!

I mean you know Delron,

a pimple I can handle but (indistinct).

I don't know Delron, it just ain't working for me baby.

It's cool though, it works, for you.

(hip hop music)

(sad wailing)

What's going on D?

I'm trying to be a handicapped, dude.

What you talking about?

My Dick Ced, it's as small as a motherfucking quarter man!

Man Latoya just fucking with your head, man.

I'm sure your shit ain't that small.

Well, come over here and look at it.

Nigga I'm not trying to look at your dick.

You're supposed to be my road dog man!

My partner,

I need you Ced!

I didn't ask you to touch it and shit.

I just want you to look at it, damn!

Come here!

Damn nigga! Where the rest of it?

I told you Ced!

Chill chill chill!

Don't think of it as little, think of it as petite,

Man there's probably a gang of three year old's

running around with a dick bigger than mine.

I gotta compare my shit to theirs, man!


Let me see your Dick!

Hey nigga! I'm not letting you see my dick!

Let me see your motherfucking dick!

Yo chill man, chill!

(hysterical sobbing)

Yo yo yo, quit acting like a punk.

Take this shit like a man.

I mean look at Muggsy Bogues, he didn't let being short

stop him from balling.

And I'm sure he don't let it stop him from fucking.

Anyways man, don't even trip,

cause there's penile enlargement places that

I mean, I don't know if your dick gonna be like silicon,

But it might be something you'd wanna look into.

(louder sobbing)

is to find a new love.

Now get yourself together, pull your pants up

I'll just make a run to the store.

All right.

How much longer for the barbecue I'm starving?

About 20 minutes.

Man, okay.

Nope.

I know something in there chicken and turkey, right?

No look. All we got is bad shit.

Kind of shit that clog up your arteries,

have you dying like a motherfucker.

Man I'm starving and everything,

but I'm not about to eat that junk.

I'm about to go to the store.

Hey, Ced about to go to store.

Why don't y'all roll together?

Why don't you go get me some turkey?

No!

Punk!

(hip hop instrumental)

[Cedrick] I had no luck with the market's in my hood.

So I was forced to go to the boys' market

on the other side of the tracks.

â™ª You know you love my stuff

â™ª Don't make me huff and puff

â™ª I got you feeling stuck

â™ª You just can't get enough.

â™ª You know you love my stuff

â™ª Don't make me huff and puff

â™ª With the words I manifest.

â™ª I could break your chest with no contest â™ª

â™ª I must confess

â™ª I leave the microphone blessed â™ª

â™ª Respect

â™ª Versatile

â™ª Getting wild with this style

â™ª Meanwhile

â™ª Your ear hole is in my total control â™ª

â™ª I'm representing from HI

â™ª The HP you know the stee,

â™ª West end and South side

â™ª Where hustlers hide

â™ª Making money

â™ª I'm somewhere laying low with the honey â™ª

â™ª Holding down the fort

â™ª With a three, two court

â™ª Yo yo

â™ª I be a quarter of the dollar

â™ª A quarter after that

â™ª I'm on the track

â™ª With a caller on the crooked scholar â™ª

â™ª Searching my brain for an answer â™ª

â™ª Wait and see if he can find it in the mind â™ª

(engine sputters)

Well well well...

You need to borrow a Barber token? (car horn blares)

Kiss the blackest part of my ass Cedrick.

Whatever, even though you acting salty.

I'm still gonna help you out

cause that's the kinda gentleman I am.

Pop the hood.

Try to start this old raggedy ass hooptie up.

(engine starts)

Thanks for fixing my ride.

But you need not flex that little bird chest,

it's kind of scary.

Oh, I see. Even though a brother help you out,

you still gonna try to clown.

Treat him like a motherfucking joke?

Yep.

(hip hop instrumental)

Come on Cedrick get in.

I mean I can give you a ride back to your crib,

that's the least I could do since you did fix my hooptie.

Oh, come on man, you're making me feel bad.

You are, I get under the hood

and get all greasy and sweaty for your ass.

And in return, all you do is clown

a brother about his chest?

Knowing I'm sensitive about my chest.

I be doing two or three pushups a night trying to get my

shit tight.

Aint my fault I got a high metabolism

so the shit don't work.

All right I'm sorry okay.

I shouldn't have went there with you.

You know, I do know you sensitive

about your chest and everything.

Lucky I was in a good mood.

I could have clowned you about your trouble spots.

What trouble spots?

Like that thing that sits above your eyebrows

the size of a watermelon.

My forehead?

Your eight head, cause it's about twice

the size of the average motherfuckers.

Don't get me started about that big ass mouth.

Cause with all that lipstick on,

it closely resembles a baboons ass.

Okay Cedric.

Okay I got the point.

Now do you want a ride or not?

Not.

Fine.
