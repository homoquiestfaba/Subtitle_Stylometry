[birds chirping]
[wind blowing]

[soft acoustic music]


[mug clanks]

I was looking for you.

[microwave beeps]

She's on.

[music continues]

[marker clatters]

a lot more unbearable</i>

<i>since I graduated college.</i>

<i>I was excited to have
the place to myself</i>

<i>after my roommates left.</i>

<i>But a lot of free time
and a lot of free space</i>

<i>has just given me more places</i>

<i>to do absolutely
fucking nothing in.</i>

<i>Well, except talk to myself.</i>

<i>If only overthinking things</i>

<i>was my only
pre-existing condition.</i>

[music continues lightly]

[muffled screaming]

[Avenue Beat's "F2020" playing]

<i>That was nice.</i>

<i>I needed that.</i>

<i>â™ª December 31st
I grabbed a beer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Threw it up, said,
"2020 is my year, bitches" â™ª</i>

Happy New Year! â™ª</i>

Thought that that was true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Until I gave
This motherfucker â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like a month or two â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This is getting
Kind of ridiculous â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At this point â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yo, my cat died â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And a global pandemic
Took over my life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I put out some music
That nobody liked â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I got really sad and bored
At the same time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And that's why I'm like â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Low-key fuck 2020 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Still sad, still ain't
Got no money â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I ain't got a watch
Up on my wrist â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just got some shit
I gotta fix, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Low-key fuck 2020 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know
About everybody else â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I think that
I am kinda done â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can we just get
To 2021, please â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Low-key fuck 2020 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª</i>

has been said,</i>

<i>but it's really rude
when they do that.</i>

[woman on TV talks indistinctly]

<i>They should definitely disable
that for quarantine.</i>

[laughter on TV]

[woman on TV]
<i>Why can't you just be...</i>


[birds chirping softly]



Ooh!

[light R&B music]

I didn't burn this one,
I swear it.

I promise.

So, um, you gonna take these
decorations down any time soon?

Um...

I was gonna wait
until you cave and do it.

Oh, okay, yeah,
that sounds about right.

I like it.
Christmas in January.

Thank you.
[chuckles]

It's cute.
Okay, yeah.

I'm just saying.
Mm-hmm.

Hey.

What?

I asked if anybody wanted any.

I just wanted a little.
Don't be so defensive.


Scooch!

Um, there's just not
really room.

Oh, okay.
Do you mind?


Oh, what, is this
not comfortable?

How about this?
Oh, okay, sure.

It's your funeral.
[laughing] Oh!

Stop!
There are feet on me...

No, I can't... you know I can't.
Mm-hmm.

...that belong to Amanda.

Do you think you're
gonna survive?

Um, no.
Yeah?

Yeah?
No.

It's not super fun?
Stop it, stop, it, stop it.

[laughter, chatter fades]

[sighs softly]


[phone ringing]

the Greystone Center</i>

<i>for Cystic Fibrosis
and Advanced Lung Disease.</i>

<i>Please leave us
your name, number,</i>

<i>and the best time of day
to contact you,</i>

<i>and someone from our office
will get back to you</i>

<i>same day
or our next business day.</i>

<i>Additionally, if this is
a medical emergency,</i>

<i>please hang up and dial...</i>



I need to hear that</i>

<i>every single time I call.</i>

<i>If I were having an actual
medical emergency,</i>

<i>I would be dead by the time
they reached that part.</i>

[phone beeps]
Hi, this is Terese Jackson.

I was just calling to get
a refill on my Creon.

Um, you can reach me back
at 513-555-6322.

Thank you!

<i>I've had a lung disease
my entire life.</i>

<i>I think I know
when to call 911.</i>

[dramatic sting]


I mean, when do you think
classes will be back?

I don't know, everyone's saying,
like, two, three weeks.

Yeah, okay.
[indistinct]

How are we gonna protect you?

I don't know.

Hey, hey, it's okay.

We're here for you.

I just... I don't wanna do this.

I know.


Hey.

We can do this.
Okay?

No one here is getting COVID.

I simply won't allow it.

Yeah, it's all about
the mindset, right?

Just have to manifest it.

I mean, we're in LA.

[all chuckle]

I think I could maybe
survive COVID.

[red-headed friend] I think we
can do better than maybe.

[deep synth music]



<i>in the pandemic.</i>

<i>Makes it a lot harder</i>

<i>to pretend to be
a normal person.</i>

[music stops]

[birds chirping outside]

[phone vibrating, chimes]

Hey...

Are you busy right now?</i>

I haven't been busy in months.

to fix that.</i>


You found a cure
for Coronavirus.

Mom, have you notified The Post?

[mom laughing] <i>Ha-ha.
No!</i>

<i>But you know I would
if I could,</i>

<i>anything to keep you safe.</i>

<i>But I meant finding a job?</i>

<i>Something to fill your time.</i>

of one minute to bring up.</i>

<i>New record.</i>

Yeah, I know.

It's just that jobs
aren't exactly

flying off the shelves
right now, so...

Well...</i>

<i>What are you gonna do
with your life?</i>

I don't know.

[mom scoffs]
[Terese sighs]

It's just... it's the end
of the world right now.

The world is literally ending,
and no one is really

thinking long-term so...

[mom scoffs]

<i>The world's not ending.</i>

<i>It's on pause.</i>

<i>And so is your ambition,
apparently.</i>

<i>How's your health?</i>

<i>I know you've been
staying safe,</i>

<i>which is great.</i>

<i>I'm already anxious enough
thinking of what</i>

<i>CF is doing to your lungs
without COVID in the mix.</i>

<i>But are you feeling all right?</i>

I'm fine.

your treatments?</i>

Yep.

on the inhaled albuterol?</i>

<i>Because I remember
your doctor saying that</i>

<i>that really helps to get
all the mucus up</i>

<i>when you do it
with the vest.</i>

<i>Gotta imagine that's
more important than ever</i>

<i>since you're so inactive
nowadays.</i>

<i>With so much free time, honey,</i>

<i>your health really should be
your top priority.</i>

<i>I know it's, like, weird times
right now and everything...</i>

like I'm patient first</i>

<i>and daughter second.</i>


<i>Her nagging just makes me</i>

<i>wanna do my treatments less.</i>

<i>Even when she's a four-hour
plane ride away.</i>

<i>I know they're important,
or whatever,</i>

<i>but it's not like I'm gonna die</i>

<i>if I don't do them
for a few days.</i>

<i>It's hard to be proactive
when it doesn't feel like</i>

<i>there's any future to plan for.</i>

[floor creaks]

[light piano sting]

shit, shit, shit.

Holy fuck.
Are you waving at me?

What am I doing?
What am I doing?

Why am I doing that?

Why am I waving like that?

[birds chirping]

[phone ringing]

<i>Oh, my God, hi!</i>

<i>Wee!
Oh, my gosh!</i>

<i>I've missed your face.</i>
Aww.

I miss you.
I miss everyone.

I miss everything.

<i>I mean, I even miss Tyler.</i>

<i>Don't kill me, okay?</i>
Okay.

We might be getting
back together.

[squeals]
[both laugh]

Okay!
Honestly...

Get it where you can, sis.

I can't even hate on you.

The last time...
I can't even recall

the last time I've been touched,

even non-sexually,
by another person.

that <i>strict?</i>

Yeah.
What are you doing?

[laughs] <i>I mean, nothing crazy.</i>
Mm-hmm.

<i>Julia and Miguel come
over a lot.</i>

<i>Sometimes, I hang out
with Steph and Trish.</i>

<i>Oh, and Jackson.</i>

<i>And, of course, Tyler.</i>

Mm.

I wanna do my part</i>

<i>to, like, stop
the spreading stuff,</i>

<i>but I feel like we're young;</i>

<i>we can afford
a few more risks.</i>

Yeah, pfft.

We... I mean, yeah.

Like, we're young.

<i>My friend's mom,
she has cancer,</i>

<i>so imagine what she
has to go through.</i>

<i>I mean, she can't see absolutely anybody...</i>
[sighs]

<i>She has to...</i>
[dramatic musical sting]

[dark-haired friend] Terese?

Uh, yeah.

I guess we need
some house rules.

What are you thinkin'?

Uh, well, everything they're
recommending to the public

but to the extreme.

Like, I don't wanna
take any risks.

What does that mean?

Don't go anywhere,
don't see anyone,

increased hygiene...


Unless it's absolutely,
completely necessary.

Well, what counts as necessary?

Where are you trying to go?

Everything is either cancelled
or closed.

Well, how long
is this gonna last?

How should I know?

Have you thought
about going home?

No.
No.

I'd go crazy with my mom.

I am...
Going home.

My mom doesn't want me
staying in the city.

I know, dude.
Same.

My mom was texting me, like,
25 times <i>today.</i>

Wait, so we're just on lockdown?

Like, I can't even go see
my boyfriend?

I mean, we can factor
Zack in as well.

But I don't think anyone
should be going in or out.

So what, I'm like a prisoner
in this house,

and I can't even see
my boyfriend?

I'm just saying for now.

Until we know more.

Please...

Well, how long?

I don't know.

I don't know, and I wish I did.

I do.

But I don't.

Well, if you're gonna
be like that,

then I obviously
can't stay here.

Um, maybe I can go stay
with Zack.

This is not about
how I'm gonna be.

This is what I have to do.

This pandemic means way
different things for me

than it does for you.

Well, the world doesn't revolve
around you, Terese.


I don't want it to.


[soft, suspenseful music]

[door rattling]

Oh, God.

Amanda?

Hey!
Hey!

What are you doing here?

Um, I live here.

Except you haven't lived here
for, like, a while now.

Well, I still pay rent.

Right.

Uh, how are you and Zack doing?

Uh, it's been better.
We just...

needed a little break,
close quarters and all.

Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

Oh, it's no big deal.
We'll get through it.

So why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

[laughs nervously]
[chuckles]

Sorry, I didn't know
I needed to ask permission.

Um...

You've really nested here.

Yeah, well, a little heads up
would have been nice.

I would have cleaned.
Mm-hmm.


<i>This should be interesting.</i>

[chatter on TV]

how can she just come back?</i>

<i>Like things are
any different now.</i>

<i>I guess I have
to give her a chance.</i>

<i>It's not like I can
just kick her out,</i>

<i>but I don't know
where she's been.</i>

<i>She could have been
playing beer die</i>

<i>with Zack's bros,
for all I know.</i>

<i>Although beer die is probably
the easiest drinking game</i>

<i>to social distance during.</i>

<i>But...</i> [scoffs] <i>...still,
I don't like this.</i>

[Amanda scoffs]

I just love Julianne Moore.

She was so pretty.

I mean, she's still beautiful.

Yeah, but not like this.

That's kind of fucked up.

That's like the ageist bullshit
Hollywood always spins.

Whatever.

[woman on TV coughs]

Ope, she's gonna die.

What?
Spoilers!

I have never seen this movie
before in my life.

All I'm saying is when
a character coughs in a movie,

it's foreshadowing that
they're gonna, like,

die of cancer, or AIDS,
or something.

As if the first sign of cancer
or AIDS is a cough...

Shh... I'm trying to watch.

[chatter on TV resumes]

[light music playing on TV]

[sniffles, crying]

foolproof system.</i>

<i>If a character coughs,
they die.</i>

<i>Maybe that's why people
are always so concerned</i>

<i>when I causally cough.</i>

<i>It's been subconsciously
ingrained into them</i>

<i>that it means I'm gonna, like,
die or something.</i>

<i>And I am, but not,
like, soon...</i>

<i>I think.</i>

[crying continues]

[marker scraping]

[door opens, thuds]

[light piano sting]

[birds chirping]

Don't you think
that's kind of creepy?

Jesus, Amanda!

Just saying.
You're drooling.

You should shoot your shot.

Oh, my God.
It's a pandemic.

I can't just go around
dating random dudes.

from a distance.

like <i>Five Feet Apart.</i>

Okay, that's really insensitive.

And also, no it wouldn't
because he doesn't have CF.

How do you know?

Because it would just be
way too ironic.

Where are you going?

Just getting a coffee.

Do you have a mask?

Duh!
Look.

All I'm saying is if you're
so starved for a relationship,

you have the perfect
potential man gardening

on the other side
of this duplex.

Whatever!
[door opens]

And also, I'm not starved
for a relationship.

I just want some dick!

[door closes]

God, I really hope
he didn't hear that.

Then again...

[marker scraping]

[door opens]

Hey.
Hey!

So, um, I think just maybe

we should be, um, limiting
how much we're going out.

I mean, I just got a coffee,

For the third time this week.

Terese, don't worry.
I'm being careful.

Okay, can you just wash
your hands please?

Yeah, I was going to.
I just got home.

Just give me the chance to.
Okay?

she was coming back,</i>

and the reason she left
hasn't changed at all.

And I feel like
I'm gonna get COVID,

and it's gonna be all her fault.

<i>Ooh, okay.
That's a little extreme.</i>

feel she's being irresponsible

and she's going outside though.

<i>But you can't know
how she's acting.</i>

Exactly.
That's my issue.

I feel like I've lost
all control with her back.

<i>Well, I know how you like
your control.</i>

<i>Have you tried talking
to her about it?</i>

Yes.

<i>No, I mean</i> actually <i>talking</i>
<i>to her about it.</i>

<i>Like setting ground rules,</i>

<i>making your standards
explicitly clear.</i>

I guess you're right.

I just, like... my anxiety's
running my life.

<i>And it can be...</i>

<i>Overwhelming when...</i>

<i>you let your anxiety consume
the people around you as well.</i>

Wait, is that how you felt?

Is that why you, like, you
left earlier than...

<i>No, no, no, no.
My mom made me come home.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>But yeah.</i>

<i>Like, I did feel that way
a little bit.</i>

<i>I... I didn't mind it
too much though</i>

<i>because I know how important
this is for you.</i>

<i>Amanda knows you have CF.</i>

<i>But I don't think she
understands what that means.</i>

a sub-leaser.</i>

[dramatic musical sting]

A sub-leaser who's gonna be here

for the next year.

Just tell her.
It'll make your life easier.

Hey.
Hey!

So I just... uh, I just wanted
to talk to you.

Um, I guess you should know
about me.

Well, since we're gonna be
living together,

I just...

Um, I thought
you should know that, um...

I have Cystic Fibrosis.

Oh.

Yeah, no, yeah.
It's not...

It's not a big deal or anything.
Um...

It's just, like, you might see
some, like, equipment,

uh, laying around
or, like, just...

Okay.

Yeah!
Uh, yeah.

Well...

Now that you know,
that is a cool fun fact

that you know about me.

Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

That's a really good juice,
that.

See ya later.


It's just like it's so much
easier being alone.

[friend on videochat] <i>You sure?</i>

<i>But you're not alone anymore.</i>

[soft acoustic music]

[Amanda] Hey.
Mm.


This.

Looks like we have
the same idea.

Since when are you
a big drinker?

Quarantine has a tendency
to change things.

Can you just, um,
wipe that down though please?

Uh, okay.

Yeah, can you just
maybe thorough...

Terese, look... I'm not
irresponsible or anything.

Can you stop watching me
like a hawk?

Okay, I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be, like,
backseat cleaning,

but I just... I realized
we haven't had

a proper conversation
about COVID safety procedures

since you've been back, and I...

I really just do need
a little bit more from you.

What, do you want me
to get tested more?

Sure, I mean, getting tested
more would be great,

but by the time
you tested positive,

you would have
already exposed me.

And I'm just trying
to think of ways

we can both avoid exposure
in general.

For me, best practice is
to kind of overreact,

and with CF, it...

like, I just... I have to be
at a higher alert

for this kind of stuff, so...

It just makes me really anxious.

Yeah.
I can tell.

[bottle scrapes]

[music continues]

I realize I should have said
this right when you got back,

but I just need you to be
at the same level

of precaution as me or it...

it's just kind of all
for nothing then.

Okay.
So what are the rules?

Okay, well everything that comes
into the house

has to be wiped down.

I mean, sanitized completely.

Sanitize your hands.
Wash your hands right after.

Leave all the bags in the trash.

Make sure that you always have
gloves on

whenever you're outside.

Sanitize the gloves
when you have the chance.

[voice becoming distant]
Keep your mask on.

I know it...

[wind blowing]
[birds chirping]


<i>That was definitely expired.</i>

<i>Maybe I shouldn't have
finished it.</i>


[light piano sting]

<i>Oh, my God.
Okay.</i>

<i>Wait.
Um...</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Amanda said...
to shoot my shot.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

<i>I mean, I guess
it couldn't hurt.</i>

<i>What do I say...?</i>

Hey!

Hey.

Uh, how are you?

[dramatic musical sting]

Lonely.

All alone in this apartment.

Respecting quarantine
to the highest level.

I could really use someone
to keep me company.

Do you know anyone
who's available?

Anyone at all?


What?

I said, "Did you hear
about the protests?"

They're happening down
the street.

Oh, that is what...
yeah, that's...

that is definitely
what you said.

Um, yes!

Are you going to that?

Yeah!
Are you?

No.
No, 'cause I...

just 'cause I'm, like, so busy,

and like, my schedule is <i>packed!</i>

Ridiculous.

This girl's got emails.

Yeah, no, that sounds
really cool though.

Uh, and I hope you have
a lot of fun.

You're plants look
really good... right now.

And your hair.
You left.

<i>Fun?
Fun.</i>

<i>Why did I say fun?</i>

<i>Protests aren't fun.</i>

<i>They are important
and necessary,</i>

<i>but they aren't fun.</i>
[sighs]

<i>Although I guess
I wouldn't know</i>

<i>because my fear
of catching COVID and dying</i>

<i>has kept me from attending,
but God...</i>

<i>now he probably thinks
I am this terrible person</i>

<i>with my packed
fucking schedule, like,</i>

<i>"Sorry, no time to fight
for justice.</i>

<i>I have to pretend
to respond to emails."</i>

[laughs sardonically]

<i>What?</i>

[Latrell James's
"Tracphone" playing]

<i>â™ª I've been on
Like a TracFone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I ain't going back home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Say what I do, trick, yeah,
I think I'm Taxstone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Go where I live, uh,
You gon' need a chaperone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No, I'm lying, gentrifying
Got the Black gone â™ª</i>

[door opening]

<i>â™ª They put the pills up in your
City 'cause the crack gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And your ass still
Ain't got no backbone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've been on
Like a TracFone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I ain't going back home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Say what I do, trick, yeah,
I think I'm Taxstone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Go where I live, oh,
You gon' need a chaperone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Go where I live, oh,
You gon' need a chaperone â™ª</i>

Jesus, I didn't know
you were there.

Mm-hmm.

Were you gonna wipe those down
like we talked about?

Yeah, I just...

I got in, and I just...

I forgot.
I'm sorry.

It's just so much to remember.

It's a lot sometimes, I know.

Then why do you do it?

Because I have to.

But you said it yourself;
you're kind of overreacting.

I mean, wiping my fruit down
just doesn't seem

like it should be
that big of a deal.

Well, it is.
The small things matter.

[song continues in background]


It's just like she makes me feel
like I'm being the selfish one.

It's not fun for me, you know?

[friend of videochat]
<i>Do you think she got it?</i>

<i>Like, when you explained CF</i>

<i>and the COVID dangers
and all that a little bit more?</i>

Maybe I should just go home.

<i>Really?</i>

Why, is it a bad idea?

<i>You were just always
so against it.</i>

Yeah, but if there's anyone
who won't flack me

for my control issues,
it's my mom.

Learned from the best.

What the fuck?

[keys clatter]

I saw your story.

Did you go to a restuarant?

Oh, yeah.
Didn't it look so good?

Why would you do that?

Well, I went to go get take-out

but decided I wanted it hot.

It doesn't matter.
It's not safe.

Well, if it weren't safe,
why would they be open?

Because the American government
is incompetent?

Because the economy has been
deemed more important

than people's health?

Well, you don't even care
about your health.

talking about?

You smoke every single day.

And?

I slack on my treatments,

and I might not take
my meds every day,

but that's kind of none
of your business.

Well, I just think
it's a little hypocritical

that you yell at me
for going out

when you don't even take care
of yourself.

My slacking on a long-term
treatment plan

is nowhere near
the same thing

as not wanting to die of COVID.

But I remember you saying

you thought you
could survive COVID.

Yeah.
I was probably being hopeful.

And it's not just
about surviving it.

You know, I could probably live

but my lungs
would never recover.

I... I didn't think that...

Yeah.
You didn't.

Amanda, you should probably
go back to Zack's

and just make both
of our lives easier if you can...


Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

I don't mean to kick you out.

It's just, like, if you can't
take this seriously, then...


I can't go back to Zack's.

The break is kind of indefinite.

We got in a big fight and...

I thought it was just a break,

but he hasn't called or texted
or anything.

So maybe you should call him.

No.
I'm not ready for that.

Um, 'cause...

what if he answers
and confirms that it's over?

Yeah, yeah.

Take your time,
do what you need to do

to get over him.

Yeah.
Yeah.

And, Amanda,

stick to take-out... please.

Okay.

[phone ringing]


Hey, it's me.

<i>Hi, honey!
Ah!</i>

<i>What a nice surprise.</i>

<i>Is everything all right?</i>

Yes, I'm fine.
I was just...

calling, um,
'cause I was wondering

what it would, like, be like
if I were to come home.

<i>Ah!
Really?</i>

<i>Well, I would love to have you,
of course.</i>

<i>But why?
What's going on?</i>

Um... nothing, I'm fine.

I was just thinking it'd be nice
to have a change of pace.

<i>Okay, sure.
Well, that's exciting.</i>

<i>I could use the company.</i>

<i>Makes me wish
I'd had another kid.</i>

<i>Now, hun, you'll have
to pay for an extra bag</i>

<i>to bring your vest in.</i>

<i>Are you stocked up
on all your meds?</i>

<i>We could just re-order things
once you get here.</i>

<i>So you don't have
to lug 'em all over.</i>

<i>Are you still on Trikafta?
Because that's...</i>

Yeah, I was just

thinking, like, hypothetically.

Um, I don't think
I would wanna leave LA yet.

Sorry.

<i>Aww.</i>

<i>You know you're always
welcome here, sweetheart.</i>

Yeah, I know, Mom.


[birds chirping]

[light piano sting]

like the perfect man,</i>

<i>but he could be, like,
a serial killer</i>

<i>or worse... a scorpio.</i>

to find out though.</i>

<i>I'd love it if my bangs could
just not look like barcodes.</i>

<i>Gross.</i>


Hey!

Hey.
Hey.

Oh, whoa, sorry, six feet.
Oh, right, six feet.

[both chuckle]

How are you?

I'm good, ya know?

I just...

Making like a plant
and photosynthesizing.

Aren't we all?

We're all plants.

So glad to see
that you're a plant guy

'cause I'm a plant girl.

Really?
Yes!

Wow, what's your favorite?

Oh, um...

Just so many, I can't even
remember the names.

It's, like, crazy.
I know.

The names are hard.
I just like the shapes.

The shapes are cool.
Yeah, yeah.

I love your plants.
Thanks!

They're super sick.

How long have you
been doing this?

Oh, just from the start
of quarantine.

No way, I would've thought
this was, like,

a many years endeavor.

No, no, just started.
Wow.

looking pretty good.

I gotta cut a couple
in the back but...

weren't a pandemic</i>

<i>so I could just ask him out.</i>

<i>I guess that's not stopping
some people,</i>

<i>but I'm not just some people.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Yo, why would anyone
ever use a bowl?</i>

<i>This is so efficient,</i>

<i>and it doesn't dirty
any dishes.</i>

<i>Bowl, bowl.</i>

<i>Should I smoke another bowl?</i>



Mm.

<i>Spoons are like small shovels.</i>

<i>I never thought about that.</i>


<i>Where are you going?</i>

<i>What would you have
to look that nice for?</i>

[keys jangle]

going to see someone?</i>

[keys jangle]

<i>No.</i>

<i>I'm way too high to talk
about this right now.</i>

<i>I don't want any smoke tonight.</i>

[door closes]
<i>Except the weed kind.</i>



[door opening]

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>She's been gone a while.</i>

[man speaks indistinctly]

really strict, so...

[indistinct chatter]

[tense music]


Who the fuck is that?

I'm Sean.

Hi.
Shut up.

And get the fuck
out of my house.

Terese.
No, keep the mask on!

Why are you still here?
Get out of my house!

Now, please.

What the... who was that?

Um... Sean.

Sean.
Sean who?

I don't know.
I met him...

online.


You did not go on a Tinder date

in a fucking pandemic.

You told me to do what I had
to do to get over Zack.

Oh, my God.

I meant, like, drink
a bottle of vodka and cry,

like egg his house,
harass him online,

not bring some <i>fucker</i> named Sean
into my house!

Our house.

You're right.
I am so sorry.

We both live here.

You just put us both at risk!

For what, stilted conversation
and a quick fuck?

Amanda, in what world
was this okay?

We've only talked about, like,
wiping things down

and sticking to takeout...
Oh, my God.

I thought the "not mingling
with strangers" was implicit.

He tested negative last week.

He tested negative last week?

Anything could've happened
within that last week,

especially if he's going out
on random dates

during a pandemic!

Well, we weren't, like,
coughing on each other.

Are you a fucking idiot?

Are you a fucking idiot?!

I know you're
from Arizona,

but I thought you understood,
like, simple science.

[Amanda sighs]

You're acting like I want
to give you COVID or something.

You're not trying very hard
to prevent it.

You can go out and be reckless
and irresponsible

and probably get away with it
scot-free,

but if you bring COVID
into this house,

I could die.

A ventilator may have always
been part of my future,

but if you're going
to live here with me,

I need you to make sure
it doesn't become

part of my present.

Okay.

CF is a lung disease.

If I get COVID,
I could be done for.

This is so serious.

I'm sorry.

This must be so hard for you.
I can't imagine.

[Terese sighs]

Well try to.

And we need to both quarantine
in our rooms

until you can get tested.


[door closes]

[light rock music]

confined enough.</i>

[vocalizing in song]

[music continues]

[door closes]


Don't worry.

Um, I just wanted
to let you know

that my test came back negative.


Yeah.

And for what it's worth,

Sean also tested negative.

He sent me a screenshot
when he asked me out again.

Well, have fun with that.

I'm not gonna go out
with him again.

You were right.
It was a stupid thing to do.

I was just so upset over Zack.

But I finally called him,

and we had a really good talk.

Uh, we're back together.

Or still together.

But I think I'm gonna start
staying there again.

Oh, that is so good!

I... that... that's so good
for you guys.

Like, I'm so happy for you guys.

Wow.
Yeah.

Um, I think it's for the best.


I'm sorry I made you feel
so unsafe.

I don't wanna
stress you out anymore.

Plus I miss him so much.

It is so hard being lonely
in these times.


Don't I know it.

Okay.
Uh, I'm gonna go pack.

Yes, yeah.
Go pack.

Go... go pack, girl.

[vocalizes indistinctly]


I'm gonna head out.
[Terese] Okay, cool.

[keys jangle]

Bye.
Bye.

[man on TV] <i>Sorry, Jeff.</i>

[man 2] <i>You know what?</i>

<i>I'm not really mad anymore,
Kevin.</i>

<i>More kind of wondering how I...</i>

[phone vibrating]

[Terese grunts]

[phone chimes]


<i>What's up?
How are you?</i>

Terrible.

There's nothing to watch.

<i>Oh, so it's, like, really</i>

<i>the end of the world then,
isn't it?</i>

Yeah, no, what do I watch?

<i>Maybe you shouldn't keep
binging into eternity, hm?</i>

What else is there to do?

<i>Uh, you could pick up a hobby.</i>

Like crocheting or knitting,
like some retiree?

<i>Maybe?</i>

Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

Nope.

Binge-watching things
is my hobby.

<i>No, it's not.</i>

<i>It's an avoidance
of productivity.</i>

How profound of you.

I didn't know our therapy
session was today.

It's not even Tuesday!
<i>It is Tuesday.</i>

<i>So...</i>

Okay.
You're right.

This is why you
are my therapist.

[light rock music playing]

Why aren't you rising?


[singing indistinctly]


asked Sydney</i>

<i>before I painted her table.</i>

<i>Whatever.
It looks sick as fuck now.</i>

<i>She's gonna love it.</i>

[music continues]


[coughing continues]

[music fades]





<i>I have been coughing
more lately.</i>


<i>Makes it kind of hard to deny</i>

<i>that I really need
to do my treatments.</i>


<i>It only takes 30 minutes.</i>

<i>I mean, just, you know, do it.</i>

<i>Just pick it up and...</i>

[mechanical beeping]

Bagel Bites.
Bagel Bites.

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>That is amazing.</i>

I know he lost,
but he's just so cute.

<i>And you said
you couldn't find a hobby.</i>

Yeah, well this one is getting
dangerous though

because I'm painting, like,
anything I can get my hands on:

mugs, almost did the wall
the other day...

Oh, my God, furniture.

<i>Uh, your furniture?</i>

Okay, so I have a gift for you.

<i>Yeah, Terese if that shit
doesn't look like it came</i>

<i>straight out of a Pier 1
Imports catalogue,</i>

<i>your ass is off the lease,
so...</i>


I'm off the lease.

[speaks indistinctly]
[Terese coughing]

<i>Whoa, are you...
are you all right?</i>

Yeah, no, I'm good.
I just cough when I laugh.


<i>Well, that's not normal,
is it?</i>

I don't know, maybe I'm just,
like, coming down

with a cold or something.

<i>But you don't think
that it's...?</i>

COVID?

Um, I hadn't thought
about that.

[phone ringing]

[woman on phone] <i>Hello.
CF Center, this is Angela.</i>

Hi.
This is Terese Jackson.

What can I do for you?</i>

<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

Well, I... I do have, like,
a bit of an increased cough

as of recently.

<i>Oh, okay.</i>

<i>Have you had any fever
or headaches</i>

<i>associated with it?</i>

Um, maybe a few headaches,
but no fever.


sense of taste or smell at all?</i>

<i>Any diarrhea?</i>

No.

it's likely not COVID,</i>

<i>but you should probably
get tested just to be safe.</i>

<i>And definitely let us know
if you start having</i>

<i>any fevers
or trouble breathing.</i>

Okay.

your airway clearance...</i>

have COVID?</i>

sure you're staying hydrated.</i>


<i>I do have a few
of these symptoms.</i>

<i>But I don't have it.
I'm just being anxious.</i>

<i>I've barely been anywhere
except the grocery store.</i>


<i>I mean, it doesn't hurt</i>

<i>to get tested.</i>

<i>Better safe than sorry,
I guess.</i>

[keys jangle]

<i>God.</i>

<i>I did not expect them
to touch my brain like that.</i>

<i>Oh, I'm fucking exhausted.</i>

<i>I guess that's what happens</i>

<i>when you stay up
till 3:00 a.m. every night.</i>


<i>close my eyes for a second.</i>

[birds chirping]

[Terese gasps]
<i>What time is it?</i>

<i>What?</i>


<i>Oh.
God.</i>

<i>I need to start remembering
to wear deodorant</i>

<i>more in quarantine.</i>

<i>Kind of hard when there's no
one around to smell you.</i>

<i>Wait.</i>

<i>Why am I so sweaty?</i>

[tense music]

<i>That's... That's what happens
when you break a fever.</i>

[thermometer beeping]

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>No fever, no corona.</i>

<i>I'm just being paranoid.</i>


[exhales warmly]

Dear God.

I don't believe in you,

but please

don't let me have corona.

I just... that would

really suck.

Um...
[clears throat]

For me.

And for you, and for everyone,

really, um...

Yeah.
Thank you.

Oh, shit.
I mean, um...

Amen.

And I hope that you're
having a good day.

Ow.


[tense music]

<i>Fuck.</i>

[exhales softly]

[thermometer beeping]


[soft, emotional music]




[phone ringing]

[woman on phone] <i>Hello.
CF Center, this is Jenny.</i>


<i>She's the worst.</i>


Hi.
This is Terese.

Um, I was just calling
for Angela

or anybody else
that I can talk to.

already out for the day.</i>

<i>I'm the only one in-clinic.</i>

<i>What's going on?
Are you feeling all right?</i>

Yeah, I just...
I think I have COVID.


<i>Well, um, have you
gotten tested?</i>

Yes.
Yesterday actually.


<i>When are you supposed
to hear back?</i>

Two to five days?


<i>Well, definitely let us know</i>

<i>when you get that result back.</i>

<i>Have you been having
any symptoms?</i>

Yeah, I had a cough.

Um, it was a normal cough.

Well, it was a sick cough.

And...

Today, I had a fever.

So...

sound good.</i>

<i>You sound really stuffy.</i>

Yeah.
That's 'cause I...

was just crying a little bit.


<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

<i>This must be
a lot to deal with.</i>

<i>You know, the anxiety alone,
I'm sure.</i>

<i>We've been exposed to COVID
in the hospital,</i>

<i>and it's just such
a terrible disease.</i>

<i>And of course,
having a chronic lung disease</i>

<i>makes it that much more scary,
right?</i>

<i>This must be really tough.</i>

reminding me.</i>

<i>So helpful, as always.</i>

Are you still there?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>



<i>for desperate measures,
I guess.</i>

<i>Damn, I haven't refilled these
in a minute.</i>


<i>Haven't needed to.</i>

[boxes clatter]


[machine beeping]
[coughing]

[machine whirring]


[paper rustling]

purpose in wiping these down</i>

<i>if I already have COVID?</i>


<i>Whatever, I'll just give it
the Amanda treatment.</i>

<i>Watch it be useless
anyway though.</i>

[pills rattle]

<i>My shopper had to have known</i>

<i>I was not doing well
with this order.</i>

[cup thuds]

[machine whirring]

[phone vibrating]
[coughing]

[whirring stops]

[phone chimes]

Hey!

<i>Hey.
What are you wearing?</i>

<i>Looks like a life vest.</i>

Oh, this is my vest.

No, this would not help me
very much in the water.

[sniffles, laughs]

[Syd] <i>Your vest?</i>
[clears throat]

Yeah, like for my treatments.

Like my airway clearance.

Or whatever.

<i>Oh, right, right.</i>

<i>I feel like I've never
seen you wear that before.</i>

Yeah, probably
'cause I wear it in my room

when I actually do treatments.

<i>Are you okay?</i>

Yeah.

I just, like, um...

I feel like, just, like,
I may have COVID.

<i>Oh, my God.
Um...</i>

<i>Uh, why do you think that?</i>

I don't know, well,
I had that cough,

and then I... I spiked a fever,

and, um...

I've just been feeling
really shitty.

And, like, I have
some other symptoms, so...

<i>But you haven't
tested positive.</i>

Not yet.

I took a test two days ago.

<i>Uh-huh, and how long till they,
um... you get that back?</i>

[Terese coughing]

Two to five days.

<i>But you can't know it's COVID</i>

<i>until you get the results back,
right?</i>

Yeah, I just... I don't know what
else it would be though.

You know?
[Syd] <i>Right.</i>

<i>Well, um, I'm so sorry</i>

<i>that you're feeling so shitty
and that you're alone.</i>

<i>That's so scary.</i>

<i>Do you want me to come
and take care of you?</i>

<i>It's only a three-hour drive.
It's really...</i>

No.
No, it's fine.

I wouldn't wanna expose you.

<i>Have you told your mom?</i>

I just... I don't
wanna worry her,

and, like, have her
calling me like...

you're gonna be fine.</i>

[ethereal rock music playing]


[pills rattle]

would be a great time</i>

<i>for my test results
to come back.</i>

[music fading]

at least I don't have it that bad.</i>

<i>Maybe I got away
with a mild case.</i>

[phone vibrating]

<i>I've managed to not have
a mental breakdown today.</i>

<i>I'd like to keep
that streak up.</i>

<i>There is nothing more
infurating</i>

<i>than watching young,
dumb people flaunt</i>

<i>parties and bars
on social media</i>

<i>in the middle
of a fucking plague.</i>

<i>I barely go out,
and I don't see anyone,</i>

<i>but I still somehow got COVID
from, like,</i>

<i>running errands or something.</i>

<i>And these idiots probably
won't even get infected</i>

<i>because karma is a bitch.</i>

<i>And not in the way
I want it to be.</i>

<i>It's been six days.</i>

<i>Where the fuck are
those fucking test results?</i>


[line trilling]

testing site.</i>

<i>This is Terrence.</i>
Yeah, hi.

Um, I got tested on Thursday,

and I still haven't gotten
my results.

so we're pretty overwhelmed</i>

<i>at the moment.</i>

<i>I can't look
into anything for you</i>

<i>unless it's been seven days.</i>

Yeah, I just feel really awful,

and I really need to know
if I have COVID.

if your symptoms worsen,</i>

<i>you should seek
professional help</i>

<i>and go to an ER
if you start...</i>


Yeah, thanks, Terrence.

Really fucking helpful.


I probably should have said
that last part in my head.

[stomach gurgling]


Aww.
Poor baby.

Are you drunk?

No.

Gas station sushi.
[laughs]

Can I help you?

Or do you need... I don't know...

do you need more soy sauce,
wasabi?

[Terese groans]

[both laugh]



[soft, dramatic music]

<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

[music continues]

[no audible dialogue]

<i>I thought if I just lived
my life how I wanted to,</i>

<i>it would be worth
it in the end.</i>

<i>I'm not ready for it

Ow.


[music continues]

[high-pitched whining

[whining, music stops]

[whining resumes]

[whining fades]

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Okay, I was only out
for two minutes.</i>

<i>That's not too bad.</i>

<i>Or is it?
Oh, fuck.</i>

<i>What difference does it make?</i>

[phone vibrating]

Hello?

[Dr. Samuels] <i>Hello.
This is Dr. Samuels.</i>

<i>I'm on call tonight.
What seems to be the issue?</i>

Hello, uh, yeah,
I think I have COVID.

[Dr. Samuels] <i>Have you
been tested?</i>

Uh, yeah, about a week ago.

It hasn't come back yet.

Um, but I've had a fever
and symptoms all week.

Um, and I have a really tight
pressure on my chest.

Um, and my hands are tingly.

And I think I just passed out.

[Dr. Samuels] <i>You think?</i>

I did.
I did.

[Dr. Samuels] <i>And you're
a CF patient, right?</i>

Yes
[Dr. Samuels] <i>Okay.</i>

<i>I think we should bring you in
to check you out</i>

<i>and see if you need
to be admitted.</i>

<i>We'll be able to test you
again for COVID</i>

<i>as well as a fall flu panel.</i>

<i>But you just passed out,
so I wouldn't recommend</i>

<i>for you to operate
a vehicle right now.</i>

<i>Do you have anyone who could
bring you to the hospital?</i>


Why didn't you tell me?

That you were sick?

I didn't tell anyone.

Well, except Syd.

[Amanda sighs]
It must be so scary for you.

Yeah.
It is.

That's partially why
I didn't tell anyone

because everyone telling me
how scary it is

doesn't make it any less scary.

Sorry.

[Terese sighs]

It's okay.

Why didn't you tell me
about Zack

right when you got back?

Uh...

I thought that

if I made a big deal out of it,
then it would have been real.

And also... [laughs]...

we don't talk.

We could.

Could we?

I know I didn't know you
that well

before I moved in,

but you never tried very hard
to change that.

And then things got so tense
when I came back from Zack's.

You just... didn't understand.

[Amanda scoffs understandingly]

I didn't un...

I don't understand.

You've always acted like CF
was no big deal.

You never actually told me
what it was.

I'm not good at, like,
explaining the science of it.

And you're not even
from Arizona.

[both laughing]

Sorry.
Sorry about that.

Um...

I guess I just...

I envy how little you have
to care about all of this.

I know.

I wish I could go out
and see my friends.

Go to restaurants
and just...

feel invincible like
everybody else I know.

But I'm not.

I've never been invincible.

Especially now.

[Amanda sighs]

Thanks again.

[door shuts]

<i>You probably passed out
from dehydration.</i>

<i>Just keep drinking plenty
of fluids.</i>

<i>We should have
your results tomorrow.</i>

<i>Someone from the clinic
will call you,</i>

<i>and we will go from there.</i>

Thank you.</i>

[music continues]

[birds chirping]

[phone vibrating]

Hello?


<i>It's Angela from the CF Clinic.</i>

<i>How are you doing?</i>

Um, I'm all right.
I'm tired.


<i>I heard you had a late night
at ATC.</i>

<i>That's why I'm calling.
Your test results came back!</i>

<i>And let me just
pull them up here...</i>

<i>Let's see.</i>

<i>I think it's in here...</i>

<i>And you are...</i>

<i>negative for COVID!</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, so what do I have?

What's wrong with me?

for rhinovirus.</i>

Rhinovirus?


[Terese coughing]
Yeah.

I just had a fucking cold!

Just a fucking cold.

Worst cold of my life,
but, like, it wasn't COVID.

Yet.


[giggles]
[Syd] <i>Please.</i>

Yeah, I know.

I was already taking
very few risks,

but this has convinced me

to be just a complete hermit

and never go outside ever again
in my life.

<i>Ah, good.
I'm glad to hear it.</i>

<i>'Cause you can't die before me.</i>

I probably will anyway?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>No need to sour the mood.</i>

<i>I'll be very kind to her
in my will.</i>

It's so funny though.

The irony in getting
another viral illness

during a padnemic,

Like... [laughs]


Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Syd, I coughed,
and I didn't die though.

I broke the trope.

<i>What?</i>

Nothing.
Never mind.

I'll tell you sometime.

[clattering in videochat]

rhinovirus even come from?</i>

Oof.

Some guy probably
got freaky at the zoo.

[Syd talking indistinctly]


<i>Well, as normal as normal is</i>

Hey!


<i>Happy almost birthday!</i>

Oh, my gosh.
You are so right.

That is so soon.

<i>Did you forget
your own birthday?</i>

No!
Of course not.

<i>Well, do you have any plans?</i>

No!
It's a pandemic, Mom.

Where am I about to go?

<i>Ah.
Well.</i>

<i>Glad to hear
you're not going out,</i>

<i>but you should do something!</i>

<i>You can order
a nice Postmates on me.</i>

<i>Something you'd consider...
bougie?</i>


You say bougie in LA, you don't
know what you're in for, Mom.

[Mom laughs]
But thank you.

<i>Anything new, sweetheart?</i>

Uh... no.

Well, I did have a bit
of a cold actually.

<i>You don't think it's COVID,
do you?</i>

Nope.
Nope.

Made sure of that.

I got tested.
It came back negative.

And I've been feeling
a lot better

as of recently too, so...

<i>Oh, that's a relief!</i>

Yeah.
Tell me about it.

You know, but I've been
really good actually.

Applying for a job
I might actually like.


I'm getting it through a friend,
so we'll see.

Oh, my gosh.
Guess what I did.

I tried to make bread.

<i>â™ª Terese â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

Ahh.

[all cheering]

<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>Happy birthday, Terese!</i>

<i>Nice.</i>
Thank you!

I'm just 23.
It's not that exciting.

your Jordan birthday!</i>

[woman] <i>That's right!</i>
Wow.

If only I cared about sports.

Still, this is kind of, like,
anticlimactic.

is that edible again?</i>

50 milligrams?
100 maybe?

Oh, I should know that.


I should know that.
[Bella] <i>Ugh.</i>

<i>You could've just said
"Fuck it"</i>

<i>and gone to some outdoor bar
or something.</i>

Mm.

What a privilege.
I wish!

I'm good though.

<i>Well, you already
survived COVID once.</i>

<i>None of us would want you
to take that chance again.</i>


<i>Yeah, I don't think any of us</i>

<i>should be taking those kind
of chances.</i>

Yeah.

That was <i>definitely</i>

enough excitement to last me
the rest of quarantine.

And enough fear for the rest
of my life, so...

didn't end up having COVID.</i>

<i>She didn't.
She's just hella dramatic.</i>

No, I thought I had it!
[laughter on videochat]

Which means I don't wanna
actually get it

and go through that again.


<i>Because I refuse to believe
the world can be that cruel.</i>

Yeah.</i>

Here's hoping.

[various] <i>Cheers!</i>
<i>Happy freakin' birthday!</i>

<i>To the birthday girl!</i>
<i>Whoo!</i>

I love you guys.

<i>Let's get it.</i>
<i>But seriously...</i>

<i>Check how many
milligrams that was.</i>

[laughter]
Um, it's too late.

I ate all of it.

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.
She's gone.</i>


My body will count 'em
and let me know...

to stop it though.</i>

[overlapping chatter]

don't get in a car.</i>

[sentimental rock music playing]

Where would I go?
Get in a car?

Where would I go?

[laughter continues]

[music continues]

[music fades]
[birds chirping]

Hm.

<i>â™ª Can't see what's coming â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm half-awake from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like a bird on a window â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As blood drips down my ear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do you see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How it goes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you break â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I'm wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Catch myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Talking shit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To my self â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't see what's coming â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm half-awake from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like a bird on a window â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Its blood drips down my ear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We all need something â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now it's a bit more clear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm always face-down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's over, over again â™ª</i>
