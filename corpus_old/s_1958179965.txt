Well, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen,
to the New Jersey Mathlympics State Final.

I've seen the best of the best,

but I have never seen anything
like this young man here.

[presenter 1] Remarkable.

Prem Patel of Jersey City
has dominated this contest

since the very first equation.
[presenter 2] Absolutely.

Twelve years old, 75 pounds, 5'1",
the kid bleeds numbers.

on everyone's mind here today is,

"Can this youngster win it all?"

Come on, Prem! You got this, baby!

Go, go, go!

Bring it home, my dog.
[presenter 1] Working in parentheses,

some of the most difficult work
you'll ever have to do.

[presenter 2]
I've never seen some of these numbers.

[presenter 1] I still think square root
has something to do with gardening.

[both laugh]
Whoo! That's my son!

[spectator 1] Yeah!
I made him.

[spectator 2] Amazing!

[presenter 1] And here it comes. Wow.

Uh, wait a second. Now hold the phone.

A bit of a changeup here.

With seconds left on the clock,
Prem is heading back to his own bench.

Prem! What are you doing?
Get back over there!

[presenter 1] Favorite teacher, Mr. Oh.
No surprises there.

[presenter 2]
There's Jerome, Prem's best friend.

[presenter 1] You may recall, of course,
that Claire, Prem's teammate,

was the actual favorite
heading into this final.

[presenter 2] Now he's eating her lunch.
[presenter 1] He is. Look at...

[presenter 2] Chugging that chocolate milk
like it was water.

[presenter 1]
Wow. No lactose intolerance there.



[presenter 1] Wow. What a showboat.
[presenter 2] Ooh!

[presenter 1]
Getting down to the final crunch now.

And, looking good, yes.

[presenter 2] Yes.
[presenter 1] Here it comes. Wow.

[buzzer blares]
[presenter 1] Prem Patel at the buzzer!

Do you believe in miracles?

We're number one! We're number one!


[crowd cheering]

[spectator 3] I love you, Prem!

[presenter 1] Prem! Prem!

Prem, you just won the Mathlympics
with the best score in history.

What is your secret?

Hard work. Like my dad used to say,
"The world's best never rest."


Absolutely beautiful. Let's take some
questions from the audience.

[crowd member] What's up, guys?

It's your boy, Brooklyn.

Wait. Why are we taking questions?

Well, it's really more of a comment.

Remember, Prem, math is for losers.

[Mr. Oh] Oh, wow. He's right.

Math is so lame.
No, listen.

What am I doing here?
Later, nerds.

Let's go do something cool.
Finally. I'll drive.

[Brooklyn] Shotgun.
Wait. Come back!

Math is cool! I promise!

[alarm clock rings]

[ringing stops]


"The world's best never rest."



â™ª <i>Whoa-oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Whoa-oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh</i> â™ª

Happy first day of seventh grade.

Did you have another math dream?
Yep.

Did you win?
Yep.

Nice.

[podcaster on headset] <i>Welcome back.</i>

<i>Today we will explore
how the loss of a loved one</i>

<i>can keep us from becoming our best selves.</i>

<i>Stop moving.</i>

<i>Find a quiet place
to reflect on your loss.</i>

{\an8}<i>A caterpillar who loses a leg</i>
<i>can regrow it by becoming a butterfly.</i>

{\an8}[podcaster]
<i>But first, its whole body dissolves.</i>

<i>Dissolve to evolve.</i>

<i>Say it with me.</i>

Hard pass.

Your egg whites are on the table.

Have you considered my proposal
regarding Pop-Tarts?

Have you considered living in reality?

You need brain food today.

<i>and face the future with an open heart.</i>

<i>Which brings us to our next sponsor.</i>

<i>Got Oat? Oat Milk.</i>

<i>Use the checkout code "Yogi"
for a 10% discount on Got Oat?</i>

324?
Eighteen.

676?
Twenty-six.

121?
Eleven.

Negative nine?
Trick question.

The square root of a negative number
isn't a number.

Not a real number.

It's something called an imaginary number.

No way.
Way!

How else do you think
my math club won Nationals?

We partied so hard afterwards,
we shut down the hot tub at the Motel 6.


Yeah, I was so excited,
I threw up everywhere.

Oh.

[student 1]
Wow, that little boy brought his mommy.

[student 2 laughs]

What's that girl looking at?
[students laugh]


No. Somebody should tell her,
"Staring is rude."

I'll get her parents' names.
[sighs] Mom, please.

Hey!
The last patient I had that ate Pop-Tarts?

Completely toothless. All gums.
Please, stop.

It's my first day. Mom!
People called her Gummy Bear.

There's no tooth fairy for that, honey.
[Prem] It's my first day.

Okay. So, after math at the high school,
you'll take the bus back to junior high

for the rest of your classes.
Like we talked about.

I'll pick you up at the rec center
when I get off.

Hopefully around 5:00.
Just like last year.

No synthetic sugar,
no car rides from strangers.

If something happens, you...
Nothing is gonna happen, Mom.

Seriously, I got this.

You got this.

[student 3] Zach, go long!
[Zach] Over here. [laughs]

Smell this.
[Zach] Hey, right here!

While we're young.

â™ª <i>It's the new style</i> â™ª

[school bell rings]

to 11th-grade mathematics!

Whoo-hoo!

Who's ready to get mathinated?


Yes!

Questions?

No? No questions.

Soâ€¦ [clears throat] â€¦I'm so excited.

This year we have some 12-year-olds
joining our high school class.

We have Prim Patel. Did I say that right?

It's, uh, Prem, like name.

Prim.
Prem.

Preem.
Prem.

Praheem.
Prem.

Prahahaha.
Perfect.

Okeydokey. And we have Claire BeausÃ©jour.

You two are the only junior high students
who passed the entrance exam.

You must be quite the dynamic duo.

Affirmative.
Yep.

[Ms. Sage]
Well, who knows what time it is?

It's time for our first math quiz!


Oh, and listen, for those of you
who are worried about grades,

I make a deal with all of my classes.

Does anyone from last year remember?

Anyone?

You know, my deal that I make?


If the Mathlympics team
finishes in the top three,

everyone on it gets an automatic A.

That's right.
It was so much fun last year, by the way.

Ma'am, we got destroyed. Like, dead last.
Winning isn't everything.

Unless you need that A, right?
You literally just said...

This is our year,
because we're hosting the event.

I rented a disco ball! [chuckles]

Dope. Do we still get to eat
at Olive Garden after we lose?

Uh, well, this yearâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦um,
our budget includes Taco Bell.

Is that as punishment?
No, no. Now, no.

You don't have to write this down.

Okay. On your marks, get set, solve!

[school bell rings]

All righty. Oh!

Okay, everybody,
for your first homework assignment,

what I want you to do is write an equation
with you as the solution. Okay?

And then you work backwards
to show how all the elements of your life

make up who you are.

It's gonna be so much fun. So, really,
have a lot of fun with it. Okay?

And you might even surprise yourself.

All righty.

Thanks, Claire. How was your summer?

Actually, my family
doesn't celebrate summer.

[Mr. Oh] Don't forget to sign up
for the talent show.

It's going to be lit. Literally amazing.

â™ª <i>She feel it, we feel it</i> â™ª

[gym student 1] Incoming!
[grunts]

[gym student 1]
Sorry! I thought you were open!


[gym student 2] Dude, you almost broke
that dorky kid's glasses.

[gym student 1]
He should've seen that coming.

Hey, Jerome!

Yo, Prem!

Help me stretch my hammies, bro.
I need to get loose.

Sorry I'm late.
I was, you know, in high school.

Oh, yeah. I texted you good luck, right?

Nah, it's cool.

Cool.
My phone was blowing up this morning.

Like, I didn't have enough thumbs.

You know what I mean?
Totally.

Class was great, by the way.

But some of those kids,

no wonder
they always lose the Mathlympics.

That's before they had you, right?


You'll pass the AP exam this year
for sure.

Then they'll have both of us.

The Dynamic Duo.

[phone pings]

[Prem] How's Amanda?
Amazing.

She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

Wow.

Actually, I need to tell you something.
[student] Amanda! Hey, girl!

I think we should take a break
from hanging out.

Just for a while.
Whoops! Sorry, fellas!

Sorry, man.

What do you mean, a break?

You know, just a break.

I need to make some time for Amanda.

Now there's school...
We crush school. Everyone knows it.

That's not what I wanna be known for,
you know?

I mean, I'm not the math guy.

That's just what people think
when we're together.

The math guy?

Sup, dorks?

Just ignore him.
Sup, BK!

J-Dog! Peep my new dance.

Stop.
J-Dog?

But Brooklyn's so mean to us,
and Sharn was held back.

BK's nice to me.

And Sharn says eighth grade's
nothing but a number.

They need one more in their dance crew
for the Fall Talent Show.

You're not a dance guy, are you?

I don't know.

My dad says if I just put myself
out there, I might like it.

[Brooklyn] Yo, J-Dog.
[Sharn] J-Doggy Dog! Come here!

J-Dizzle.
[Brooklyn] J-Dog! Yo!


Did you see my video? It just dropped.

[thunder rumbles]

[raindrops falling]

what happened at work today.

Ronda was measuring a diuretic
for a patient,

and she was using deciliters
instead of cubic centimeters.

I was like,
"Honey, he's gonna pee forever."

Ronda, more like Wrongda. [chuckles]

Wrongda.

Mmm. So, how'd you do in math today?

It was good. We had a quiz.

[mother] And?
I was the only one who finished.

There it is.

How was the rest of your day?

I actually need some help with something.

A homework assignment.

Of course. Math homework?

It's about Dad.

Sorry.

I know you don't like to talk about him.

Suresh would want us to be happy.

Not dissolve into tears
like some sad caterpillar.

Huh?
This needs pepper.

So, what do you need for your homework?

What was he known for?
Known for?

I mean, was he smart?
Definitely, but he wasn't a math guy.

What kind of guy was he?
[sighs] There it is.

I'll never know who I am
unless I know who he was.

He wasâ€¦

funny, confident, handsome.

He was like you. Everyone loved him.
Doesn't sound like me at all.

I'm sorry.
I don't really know how to help.

Just tell me anything.

Tell me about the night
that photo was taken.

That was a very long time ago.

What's the Leopard Lounge?

It's the club where we met.

Like a dance club?
A hip-hop club.

Your father had a real way with words.

Wait. Dad was a rapper?

How else do you think he came up with,
"The world's best never rest"?

Mom, that is so cool.

Was he good?

He wasâ€¦

one of the best I've ever seen.

I wish you could've seen him.

Sometimes I forget how he looked
and how he sounded.

Okay. [chuckles]

So, when I was in nursing school,
we used to go dancing on the weekends.

My girlfriends told me about this place.
It was poppin'.

<i>this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays.</i>

You said you only went on weekends.

Well, some Tuesdays. Not if we had exams.

I don't need to explain myself.

Anyway, you were at the club.

We were at the club,
and my girlfriends were sayingâ€¦

This emcee's an underground legend.

Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah.

Blah, blah. [chuckles]
Why are theyâ€¦

I wasn't really listening.

Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

I had a lot on my mind, like school...

Priya, stop thinking about Doug. Okay?

It's over. He's not even that cute.

Who's Doug?

Who? I don't know.
I can't really remember...

Good thing we stopped you
from getting that tattoo of his name, huh?

We literally saved your butt.

[friend 1] Hey, girl.
We'll go grab our drinks.

So, we get in, and we're waiting
for the show to start when...


["My Heart Will Go On" playing]

I don't have a line.
I just wanted to meet you.

My name's Suresh.

I'm not interested.
[song stops]

Okay. [chuckles]
That's what you said to Dad?

I didn't feel like being hit on.

Would you like to have a drink?
No.

I don't drink anything ever.

Then why are you in a nightclub?
Thank you. Bye.

I wanna walk away. I really do.

Please do.
Yes. You've set a clear boundary.

The only problem is
you're the prettiest girl in the room.

Oh?
And I just have this thing inside of me

that also tells me that
you're the smartest.

Like you probably got a...
What, 1550 on the SATs?


1600, see?
Thank you.

I went low so that I...
How did you know I was smart?

I could tell from your footwear,
'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub.

Also, if it gets coldâ€¦
[Priya] Uh-huh.

â€¦you've got the turtleneck motif.

It's mesh.
Mm-hmm.

Mom, don't shut him down.
You need to make a baby.

Listen, I got a thing to do, but if you
change your mind about that drink...

Don't hold your breath.
You remind me of my mother.

I love you. Goodbye.

So cold.

Well, yeah,
'cause you know he's your dad now.

For all I knew back then,
he could've been a psycho axe murderer.

So dark.

It happened.
2000s were a very dangerous time.

[crowd cheering]
[deejay] Ladies and gentlemen,

please welcome to the stage
the World's Best Emcee.

Let's make some noise.
[crowd] Whoo!

It's him. It's the legendary emcee.

He's gonna use his music
to melt your cold heart.

[phone ringing]
Hmm?

No, wait. What are you doing?

Don't you answer that.

No, Mom. Mom!

[Doug] <i>â€¦what to do, but you were gone.</i>
Doug, listen.

<i>You're so checked out.</i>

I can't believe you missed the show.

I can't believe you're so judgy.
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

Doug, I'm sorry. I think I just
fell in love with the idea of you.

But you have no culture, Doug.

Name all four members of Destiny's Child.

There's no one named Shelly
on Destiny's Child.

[sighs]
[friend 2] Blah, blah, blah.


[friend 2] Blah, blah, blah.

My friends had a blast,
but my night was a bust.

Tell me about it.

I am. And this is the best part.

[sighs]
[person beatboxing]


â™ª <i>Once upon a time, not long ago</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I was a little brown boy</i>
<i>Down in Baltimore</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Mom and Pop both gave me a microscope</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>But me, I decided to hold a microphone</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And the rest of the story</i>
<i>You know how it goes</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I ate all of my curry</i>
<i>And my vegetables</i> â™ª


<i>He had this look in his eyes.</i>

<i>He called it riding the line.</i>

<i>Halfway there and halfway to infinity.</i>

So, come on. What happened next?

I let him buy me that drink.

But did he make an album?

Did he go on tour?

No, it wasn't like that.

You have such an overactive imagination,
Prem.

But you said he was a legendary emcee.

That he was the best in the city,
maybe even the world.

I mean,
Suresh didn't care about that stuff.

He didn't need anyone to tell him
how great he was.

He knew.

He did it because he loved it.

Like you and math.

But did he...
[Priya] That's enough, Prem.

Finish your dinner. It's homework o'clock.

[Prem sighs]

[words echoing]


<i>Infinite energy, legacy</i> â™ª

[rapping indistinctly]

[rapping continues]

â™ª <i>I'm gonna twist the key in the ignition</i>
<i>And ride... â™ª</i>

[rapping continues, indistinct]

â™ª <i>World's best, oh</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>We give it all and never less</i>
<i>Twist the key in the ignition</i> â™ª

[indistinct rapping stops]

"The world's best never rest."


Sup?

[both screaming]

Wait. Why are we yelling?
Dad?

Hi.

[footsteps approaching]
[Priya] Prem? Prem!

What was that? Are you okay?
You were yelling.

Yeah, I'm fine.

Um, I was factoring a polynomial,
and the solution snuck up on me.


Don't stay up too late.
No doubt.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Good night.
Night.

Dang. She looks so good.

What is going on?

[Suresh scoffs] I don't know.

I'm sick. Mom's food finally poisoned me.

That woman cannot cook.

Are you a ghost?

A gho... No.

Look at my complexion.

I am radiant. Okay? No.

I'm like a memory remixed with a fantasy.

You cooked me up
in that big old brain of yours.

Good job, by the way.

Soâ€¦

you're, like, my imaginary friend?

Yeah, kinda.

Wow. What a beautiful picture.

Hey, man. Why you got so many pens?

You know what you should be collecting?

Rocks.

Yeah. They're literally everywhere.



Little man, I'm basically
a fever dream wearing boots.

And they're heavy.

I'm too old for an imaginary friend.

Well, you're too young
for a midlife crisis, but here we are.

So, who is Prem Patel?

Who is he gonna be?

I don't know.

Hey. Every problem has a solution,
little man.

And you and me,

we are gonna figure
this one out together, okay?

Sometimes you just have to add
a brand-new variable

to change the whole equation.

That's not me. I can't rap.

Why not?

Look, hip-hop is in your DNA.

You gotta dream big, little man.

[rhythmic beating, rattling]
Ooh.

Wait. What's that sound?

That's destiny.

And destiny doesn't knock twice.

I think you mean opportunity.

â™ª <i>World's Best, oh</i> â™ª

[crowd cheering fading out]


Is that supposed to be you?

You're, like, a rap guy now?

I'm putting myself out there.

Okay.

Okay.
Okay.

Okay, cool.
[Mr. Oh] Ooh. What up, math champs?

One plus one equals double trouble.

Am I right? [chuckles]

No?

Oh, Jerome, I'm digging the new threads.

Thanks, Mr. Oh. But I'm late. Gotta dip.

Oh... Oh, okay. See you tomorrow.

Do the kids still say dip these days?

I-I gotta go.

Whoa, hey. Um, soâ€¦

Is something going on
between you and Jerome?

Um, look, if you ever need
to talk to someone, I'm here...

Thanks, Mr. Oh, but I got it.
Yeah, yeah.

Tell your mom I say, "What up?"

[mouthing words] Oh, my God.

[teens chattering]

[Suresh rapping]

Hey, buddy. Um, what was that guy
talking about back there?

You mean Jerome?
Oh, no, no.

I meant, uh, <i>Dead Poets Society</i>.

"Hey. Say hi to your mom for me."

All that stuff. What was that about?
Are they like aâ€¦

No. Mr. Oh is just a nice guy.


I mean, if you like dimples. [gags]

Or like, you know, muscles.
Who needs those?

Or like a natural charisma
that's really hard to deny.

But you know what? I think
we can both agree that his jokes suck.


The World's Best Emcee.
[sighs]


Sharn, this "math-hole"
thinks he's a rapper now.

Yo, J-Dog. Is your boy here an emcee?


I'm not his boy. Okay?

Oh. I think this dude jealous
'cause we let J-Dog in our crew.

If you've got bars, let's hear 'em.

Yo, Sharn. Drop a beat.

What?
Sharn.

[clears throat]


Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

Yo, everybody, come in. Come in. Come in.

Everyone. Gather up. Gather up. Everyone.

Peep my boy Prem,
the world's best rapper. Yeah.

[chanting] Prem. Prem. Prem.
[beatboxing]

[crowd cheering]

[beatboxing continues]

[chanting continues]

That's what I thought.

You're good in school,

but in the real world,
you'll always be a loser.

[both chuckle]


It's Mercedes and Gabe
from Ms. Sage's class.

We're gonna do some homework.

Do you wanna come?

No doubt.
Wait, Prem.


Peep our dance crew on TikTok.

Liquid Smoke.

I-It's spelled, um, L-Iâ€¦

[mumbles] Ah, Q.
Q, bro. Q.

â™ª <i>When I walk out the house</i>
<i>People lookin' at my style</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause I meet and I greet</i>
<i>And I hit 'em with a smile</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>The first thing they say is</i>
<i>There goes ShantÃ©</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>As soon as I step out on the scene</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>That's Roxanne ShantÃ©, the OG queen</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>A lot of hip-hop</i>
<i>With a little bo-bo</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>A lot of freestyle</i>
<i>And a real dope flow</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm cool, I'm fresh as ever</i> â™ª

What was that about?

It's nothing.

Hey, you don't think we've been
put on blast like that before?

Truth is bullies are afraid of dreamers.

[song ends]

What did you get for the second one?
282.6.

Because volume isâ€¦ half of...

â™ª <i>What's your favorite flavor of pie?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Serve it R-squared</i>
<i>To get the area inside</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Top it with diameter</i>
<i>Circumference you'll see</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Pi R-squared times H gets you V</i> â™ª

I know that's not...
That's an earworm. Hella catchy.

I'll remember that. For real.

But, like, who cares about math?


Yo, I got scholarships on the line.

Student debt crisis don't play.

I need to ace this class
to get into film school.

I wrote this script
that's like this historical movie,

but the setting is right now,

looking back
from a thousand years in the future.

It's ahead of its time.

But what about the Mathlympics?

Ms. Sage said...
Stop playing.

Those other teams got, like, 50 kids.
They got uniforms.

Know what we got on that quiz?
G's.

Ms. Sage had to make up a grade for us.
That's how bad it was.

We're not math kids like you.
I'm not a math kid.

Okay, then what are you into?

Rap.

Mostly rap.

Lots of... Lots of rap.

Okay.
What are your top five favorite emcees?

Only five?


Um... [clears throat]

Geez.

Um.

Emcee Escher.

That dude that does the trippy drawings?

No, it's another guy.

My dad was a rapper,
so he's probably my favorite.


He was an underground legend.

He did Freestyle Tuesdays at this club,
the Leopard Lounge.

What's his name?
Probably haven't heard of him.

He died when I was five.

Cancer.

Oh, man, that sucks.
Sorry, dude.

He, uh, he left me some music.

[Gabe] Whoa, vintage.
[Mercedes] Can we?

Biz Markie. Slick Rick.

"Teach Me How To" Doug E. Fresh.

[Gabe chuckles]
Okay.

Naughty by Nature.

[announcer on recording]
<i>Give it up for Naughty by Nature.</i>

[on speakers] â™ª <i>I live and die for hip-hop</i>
<i>This is hip-hop for today</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I give props to hip-hop</i>
<i>So hip-hop hooray</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho</i> â™ª

Do you guys listen to this song a lot?


Do you listen to this song a lot?

[song stops]

Come on. This is a classic.
Yeah.

[clears throat]

I guess I mostly listen
to the newer stuff.

These joints are the foundation.

All hip-hop used to be underground
until these heads changed the game.

Prem, these guys took a mic
and two turntables

and turned it into the number-one music
in the world.

They dreamed big and lived large.

Just like we're gonna do. You feel me?

I feel you.
[chuckles]

[Gabe, Mercedes chuckle]

â™ª <i>Hip-hop, hip-hip-hop</i>
<i>Hip-hip-hop, hooray</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>There's many hungry hip-hoppers</i>
<i>One reason hip-hop's tip-top today</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Swerve what you heard</i>
<i>'Cause I ain't baling no hay</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Ain't chopping no crops</i>
<i>But still growing every day</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Here's a thunder sound</i>
<i>From the wonders found</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>From the underground...</i> â™ª

[song stops]

You know, the key to good cooking
is you don't need to season it that much.

You can literally just boil things.

Mmm. Mm-hmm.

Mmm. That's good.

That's good. That's perfect.

So what did you get up to after school?

Just hung around in the rec center.

Oh, with Jerome?

Kinda.
Kinda?

I looked up the Leopard Lounge.

Oh. Uh-huh.

They still do Freestyle Tuesdays.

Maybe we could go sometime?
Into the city?

On a school night?
Yeah. Forget it.

Hey. I miss him too, Prem.

But the way to heal is to move forward,
not backwards.

That's why we have goals.

Like the Mathlympics, right?

Okay.

289.

Hey.

289.

Oh, uh.

Seventeen.

["I Wish" playing on computer speakers]

â™ª <i>Hello</i>
<i>I wish I was a little bit taller</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I wish I was a baller</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I wish I had a girl who looked good</i>
<i>I would call her</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I wish I had</i>
<i>A rabbit in a hat with a bat</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And a '64 Impala</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I wish I was, like, 6'9"</i>
<i>So I can get with Leoshi</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause she don't know me</i>
<i>But yo, she's really fine</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You know, I see her all the time</i>
<i>Everywhere I goâ€¦</i> â™ª


[song fades]
Let's get to work.

Are you sure, little man?

'Cause Mom just saidâ€¦
She said to have a goal and I do.

The talent show is two weeks away.
So, I'm moving forward.

Hmm. Some people say
they're moving forward,

but they're really just running away
from what's behind them.

Ooh, that line is fire!
I gotta write it down.

Oh, wait a minute. I'm not real.
[sighs]

Are you gonna tell me
what these mean or not?

Yeah, all right. Um, peep game.

Rhymes are like multiplication tables,

and you memorize them so that you
can hop from one to the next.

â™ª <i>Yada yada fuel</i>
<i>Yada yada yada tool</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Yada yada yada pool</i> â™ª


That is nonsense.

That's algebra, son.

Okay.

X plus Y equals fuel.

You wanna get to fuel soâ€¦

You work backwards from the result.

Ooh.
Solve for X and Y.

Yes. And that's how you get the sentence.

â™ª <i>I let my words become the fuel</i>
<i>I let my rhymes become the tool</i> â™ª

I made a splash like in a pool?

Cannonball!

â™ª <i>I spin my rhymes like a spool</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Changed my name like Istanbul</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Changed the game, break the rules</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Threw the gauntlet like a duel</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I eat emcees like bowls of gruel</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>That's how the stage became my school</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My mind is a crown jewel</i>
<i>The shine will astound you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Design if I knew</i>
<i>Divine profound views</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My lines will blind you</i>
<i>Melanated miraculous</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Assembling my rhythms</i>
<i>Like I was counting an abacus</i> â™ª


This is inside you.

But you gotta put in the work
to get the payoff.

You practice it
till it feels like breathing.

Until you're riding that line.

When you're halfway there...
And halfway to infinity.

Yes.



Hey. It's late.

Get to bed, please,
or you'll be a wreck in the morning.

Cool.

Cool.

Cool.

Okay. Well, I guess I should hop back
into the gray nothingness where I live.

Sit your imaginary butt back down.

We're just getting started.

[Ms. Sage] Paul? Pablo?

Praheem?

Praheem?

I'm collecting the homework.

Your equation of me.

Oh. Right.

I'm still working on it actually.

[Gabe chuckles]

how you place third at Mathlympics.

[both chuckle]

{\an8}So, in the last scene
the spaceship door opens

{\an8}and it's his grandpa,
who is also his grandson.

Go to a close-up as the dude says,
"Long time no see!"

Fade to white.

Uhâ€¦

I-I-I mean...

You seem very confident.

Self-love is my superpower, baby.

So, when are we gonna hear you spit?

There's a dress rehearsal tomorrow
after school for the Fall Talent Show.

For real?
Sick.

We're a thousand percent there.
[Gabe] No.

We're ten to the power
of ten percent there.

You feel me?

I mean, that's not a thousand,
but I feel you.


You're not much of a coffee drinker, huh?

This is a disaster.

We still have time.
The show's in two days.

Oh.
What if I open my mouth and I suck?

What if I prove them all right?

Can't wait for the show, Prem.
Leave me alone!

[sighs]
Little man, you're overthinking it, okay?

Fear keeps us from living.

And the World's Best Emcee
doesn't have time for that.

So, I'm supposed to just
pretend I'm not afraid?

Yeah. [chuckles]
You fake it till you make it.

That's how "What if?" becomes "What's up?"

But what if...

[Brooklyn laughs]


Whoops. I was aiming for the trash.

Oh, I'll get it.
What?

No. No, Sharn. Sit down.


Listen to the beat in your own head.

Hip-hop is like life.

You can't go halfway.

You gotta go hard.

You wanna be the World's Best Emcee?

You gotta have this.


You need to be your own hype man.

[rhythmic beat playing]

I'm-I'm not afraid.

What? I'm sorry. Did you say something?
I can't hear you.

I said I'm not afraid.
Was that a mouse or a lion?

What did you say?
I said I'm not afraid.

Louder, little man.

I saidâ€¦

â™ª <i>We just smile</i>

â™ª <i>Last but not least</i>

What's wrong if he carries her purse?
Not the point.

That's being gentlemanly.
Purses are more practical.

Dad!
You can fit a whole sandwich in a purse.

â™ª <i>Squint and you'll see that his pride's</i>
<i>The size of pocket lint</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>He started at the bottom</i>
<i>And he hasn't moved an inch</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I don't need a beat, a friend, a dad</i>

â™ª <i>You'll never tear me down</i>
<i>You can't stop this</i> â™ª

Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

Too far. Too far.

[Amanda laughs]

[Sharn, Brooklyn laugh]


Baby's first rhyme book.


And wh-who's Sureesh?

[Sharn laughs]
[Brooklyn] Oh, whoa, big man.


It's my dad's. Give it back.

Your dad raps too?

Aw, that's adora...
I said give it.

Sharn.
Oh, think fast.

Throw it in the trash. Go on. Throw it.

Throw it in the trash.
[Sharn] Go.

[whispers, indistinct]

M-My dad keeps a journal too.

But his is in Elvish.

Saved by Creepy Claire.

Are you two dating now? Gross.

Prem and I are just friends.
[Sharn] Sure.

Like my dad is "just friends"
with Brooklyn's mom.

Kiss her to say thanks, Prem.

Give me that.

We're not even friends, okay?

Creepy Claire.

[Mr. Oh]
They found your jacket at the gym.

What's going on over here?

[school bell rings]

Is this what living at a hundred
feels like? 'Cause it sucks.

I didn't tell you
to pick on Ginny Weasley.

You said hip-hop was 50% confidence.

Whoa.

Phony rappers knock other people down
to build themselves up.

Real emcees, like us, we own who we are.

That's what makes us untouchable.

Like Mercedes's superpower?

Exactly like that. Let me see that.

Look, it's the difference between running
your mouth and having something to say.

Yikes.

Oh.

Hey, Priya. How have you been?

Busy. Stressed. So, the usual.
[Mr. Oh] Hmm. Yeah.

I get it. [chuckles]
Yeah. You?

Same.
I feel like a fifth of my former self.

But my therapist says I'm two-tenths.

[chuckles, snorts] Okay.

That's really bad.
I couldn't resist.

[both chuckling]

We should...
Sorry if I made it weird.

No. It's fine.
I was out of line to ask you out.

No, no. Not out of line. It's just...

Tacky.

You're Prem's teacher.

Well, technically not anymore.

He just might not understand if we...

He-He understands calculus, butâ€¦

Emotionally.

Emotionally.

He's so into her.

[Priya giggles]
I told you.

So, have you told the girl's parents
what happened?

You know,
their houseboat doesn't have a phone.

So I could try writing them
a letter or something.

But you know, I think Claire will be fine.

It's uh... It's Prem who worries me.

Yeah.

The fight was over an old notebook.

Prem said it belonged to his dad.

He signed up for the talent show
as the World's Bestâ€¦

Riding in cars with high schoolers?
What are their names?


Mom.
And what happened to your hair?

They're helping me get ready for the show.

No, you're quitting the show.
You need to focus on your schoolwork.

Mom, please. I can't let the haters win.

Winning isn't everything.
Since when?

You push me to be the best at math,

but when I wanna be the best
at something else,

it's not important.

You love math. You have a gift.

It's just not cool anymore.

Give me the notebook.

It's a rhyme book.

You didn't even know it existed.

You just threw his stuff in a box
and shoved it in a closet.

Prem.
I need it to learn how to rap.

My dad was the World's Best Emcee.
That is not...

This obsession with your father
isn't healthy.

We have to move on.

I listened to a whole podcast...

Acting like he never existed
isn't moving on.

I'm not doing this with you.

Give me the notebook. Now.
No.

He'd want me to have it.
You don't know what he'd want.

You didn't know him.

I mean, Suresh didn't want you to be him.

He wanted you to work hard
and get good grades, a good job...

So I can be you?


[Ms. Sage] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>I've got the 50 Lunchables.</i>

I'll add the 30 granola bars.

And that'll be enough for
the State Mathlympics snack table.

It's right around the corner, people.

We still haven't locked in a judge,

but I got a soft yes
from Neil Patrick Harris.


He was actually a great math student.

He could've been an accountant.

Hey!

What's up, Notorious MIT?

What happened to you yesterday?
I got in a fight.

Word. Was it with that dance crew?
Doesn't matter.

I need you to take me
to the Leopard Lounge.

It's Freestyle Tuesday.

You have the rehearsal after school.
Mom made me quit the show.

Come on.
Why?

She thinks I'm a phony rapper.
That this is all just a fantasy.

But that place is real.

My dad was really there.

If I wanna be a real emcee like him,
that's where I need to go.

[neon sign buzzing]


Maybe it pumps up after dark.

This place is such a vibe.

Can I help you kids with something?

I'd like to speak with the manager
about performing here tonight.

[bartender laughs] What are you? Nine?

It's an all-ages venue.

My name's Prem Patel.

Dope.

Well, the sign-up sheet is right here.

Show starts in three hours.

Two-drink minimum.

Cream soda's five bucks.

My father used to perform here.

He was an emcee.

Maybe you saw him?
A lot of people perform here, kid.

But he was an underground legend.

The best rapper in the city,
maybe even the whole world.

Sick. Can he do a set here tonight?

No, he can't.

[sighs]
Wait.

You're Suresh's kid, aren't you?

Man, Suresh.


So he really was here.


Man never knew how to shut up.

[all chuckle]
That's definitely him.

Yeah? [chuckles]

I heard that heâ€¦

I'm sorry.

Hey. I-I have a picture of him down there.
You wanna see it?

Yeah.

[bartender sighs] Yeah.

What's this?

That's your dad doing his thing.

But he was an emcee.

Oh, I know. [chuckles]

We worked together for five years.

He talked a better game than anyone.

And his favorite thing
to talk about was hip-hop.


Biggie made "Juicy Fruit" a hit.

Treach, Krayzie Bone, Slick Rick.

Don't sleep on the West Coast cats
like Gift of Gab.

Hey. What about Fred Durst? He can spit.

What?

Eddie, that sentence
is not gonna age well.

Listen, I'm the expert, okay?

And I'll tell you all, I'm gonna be
at the top of the list one day.

Yo, Skee-Lo. One more.

I've been waiting.

Fine, but only because I'm scared of you.

Dad?

Suresh had big dreams.

The way he talked about it,
it was like he was his own hype man.

All right, grumpy. Here you go.

This one's on me because I made you wait.

But just so you know,

the man pouring you your drink right now
is gonna be a world-famous rapper.


Oh, you laugh.

But I've been grinding on my rhymes.

I will be doing shows.
I'm gonna do features.

I'll put out a album.

And everything in this book will make me
the World's Best Emcee. Okay?

You heard it here first.

Hey, Corey.

Make your next move your best move, huh?

Put me on tonight.
I can't do it. I need you back here.

We have that bachelor party later.
[sighs]


I mean, I would see him at open mics
after work with the fellas.

He had skills.
But what happened?


One day he quit, and I heard he moved
to Jersey and settled down, you know?

Typical story.

[glass shattering]

Yo, Suresh. Can you get that for me?
Yes, sir. One second.

I'm leaking genius over here.
[sighs]

Come on, brother. Now, please.


The world's best never rest. Am I right?



Oh, right.

Give the man a free drink
and he drops it on the ground.

Well done. I got it. I got it.

You're not getting another one.

Hey, Corey. We need a smaller broom.

I'm gonna get carpal tunnels.

about rap anyways?

He's just some bartender.
Gabe!


So your dad wasn't a rap legend.

Doesn't mean you won't be.

Shoot. My dad's a dentist.

Yeah, my dad's legit into camping. Like...


He failed.

It means that's a part of my equation.

Look, the real world isn't pass or fail.

If you have something to say, just say it.

We're gonna need way more smoke.

We're Liquid Smoke, man.

You're moving like a robot, J-Dog.
And not in a cool way.

Did you stretch your hammies
like we talked about?

The hammies aren't the problem.

[Prem, distorted, shouts]

You're grounded.

No computer or TV.

No more rides from your friends.

I don't know who you are anymore.

You were right.

I'm not an emcee.

I went to the Leopard Lounge.


Dad wasn't the world's best anything.

He was a phony rapper. A loser.

No. Don't ever say that about him.

He was the best for us
in every way that mattered.

This matters to me.

It's actually my fault for trying
to give you one good memory of him.

But it was a lie.
Everything I told you was true.

Then you lied to yourself.

That's why you can't move on.

You're still married to a fantasy.
Prem!

[footsteps departing]

[paper ball clatters]

Oh, three points!

He's on fire!

Get out of my head.

I told you I couldn't rap!

We both failed.

Why? Because I'm not Snoop or Dre?

You gave up.
You could've done something great.

I did, Prem.

I hit the lottery.

My life was everything I wanted it to be.

All the things you taught me
added up to nothing.

Added up? [scoffs]

Little man, life is not an equation.

I'm sorry that I haven't been here.

But even if I was, it's not like
your life would be a literal musical

with perfect choreography
and fresh outfits.

No. It's messy and bumpy
and scary and strange.

That's what makes it beautiful.

Look, you don't need me
to teach you who you are,

because there is no right answer.

But you're not really here.

welcome to the Fall Talent Show.

[Mr. Oh] Yes, thank you. Thank you.

I'd love to kick this off with some hits
from my old stand-up act.

[laughs]
[audience member] Please don't!

[audience laughter]
[audience member 2] Wow.

[Mr. Oh] But there's so much talent.

Let's jump in.

Everyone, please take your seats.

Hey, Claire.
Hi.

I'm sorry about what I said before.

[Mr. Oh] Our next actâ€¦

Saying it doesn't make it true.

That's what my dad told me
about the government.

Don't fall asleep. I pee often.

I remember.

Give it up for our very own dance crew,

Liquid Smoke.

I broke up with Amanda.
For real?

I fell in love with the idea of her,
you know?

Plus, she made out
with Greg Li during English.

Dude!

Looks likeâ€¦ [sighs] â€¦we both
have some growing up to do.

Why don't you do it for me?

Do what?
The dance.

I'm not any good.

Who cares, man?

Just do your best.

[Suresh speaking lyrics]
<i>"To the smartest girl in the room</i>

<i>Prettiest too</i>

<i>I know it'll be hard to get through</i>

<i>But you need to hear
What I'm giving to you</i>

<i>I feel the beat
And the mic speaking in me</i>

<i>And even though the fight
Keeps weakening me</i>

<i>With you and Prem as my light</i>

<i>No one's freer than me</i>

<i>You know, I used to say
'The world's best never rest'</i>

<i>But now what I find is this</i>

<i>Our happiest moments were somehow</i>

<i>The quietest</i>

<i>I'm sorry I'll miss
Making memories with you</i>

<i>But my dream's for you
To both live your lives</i>

<i>So please make it come true</i>

<i>You brought out the best in me</i>

<i>You have since day one</i>

<i>But the best in us both
I see in our son</i>

<i>So just know that today</i>

<i>I only feel blessed</i>

<i>So it's okay to let go</i>

<i>And let Prem do the rest"</i>


What?

Oh, my God.


[footsteps approaching]

Suresh got this when you were born.

Prem means love.
And Krishna is the god of love.

I was the thinker, and he was the dreamer.

I forgot how much I missed that about him.

Until I started seeing it in you.

You're more like him every day, Prem.

I wasn't ready for it,

but I'm sorry I ever asked you
to be anything else.

I'm sorry too.

You know, hip-hop was
the love of your father's life until...

He met you?

Until he met you, Prem.

Suresh loved being your dad
more than anything.

That's who he was.

He was the best dad.

I know.

Hey.

I called in sick.

I thought maybe we could go into the city.

Leopard Lounge is played out,

but I know this sick spot in Harlem
with a killer open mic.

Suresh took me there
to see Naughty by Nature.

â™ª <i>Hip-hop, hooray</i>
<i>Ho, hey, ho</i> â™ª

[chuckles]
You think I don't know hip-hop?

It's just like math.

When it's right, it just flows.

It makes sense of the universe.

[Prem sighs] There's something else
I have to do today.

To help my friends.
Something I love to do.

Something I learned
from an underground legend.

â™ª <i>My life be like ooh ah, ooh</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Yeah</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>My life be like ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My life be like</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It's times like these that make me say</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Lord if you see me</i>
<i>Please come my way</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Like leaving bread crumbs</i>
<i>For when I stray</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Rely on sacrifice</i>
<i>And the price you paid</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Feel me like a fingertip</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Fa-fingertip</i> â™ª


So, what's the solution, little man?

Who is Prem Patel?

The truth is, I'm just a math guy.

[crowd chanting] Prem!


But I'm also an emcee.
Word.

â™ª <i>World's Best</i> â™ª

I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.
[Suresh] Uh-huh.

I'm a sharp dresser and a good friend.
Ooh.

[Prem] I'm confident. Sometimes.
[Suresh] Yeah.

And I try to keep it real.

I'm a winner and a loser.

<i>A thinker and a dreamer.</i>

[crowd cheers]
And I'm just getting started.

<i>Prem equals infinity.</i>

[crowd chanting] <i>World's Best!</i>

Sounds like the right answer to me.

What am I looking at?

It's destiny, baby.

[Ms. Sage]
It's time to make math-e-magic, people!

Guess what?

Neil Patrick Harris canceled on me.


So, I called my friend Doug E. Fresh.


Let's get mathinated, people!

â™ª <i>You take i times i</i>

{\an8}[Prem] â™ª <i>No matter where we go</i>
<i>You know that we're unstoppable</i> â™ª

I gotta say,
what I've seen today is magical.

You should all be proud of yourselves.

But unfortunately,
there can only be one best in state.

In third place,
Ms. Sage's 11th-grade class.

[students screaming]
[screams, laughs]

Oh, yeah! Yes! Yeah! [laughs]
Yes! [laughs]


[cheering, laughing]


[Doug E. Fresh] If the third-place team
can please calm down,

I'll announce the rest of the winners.

I-It's alpaca wool.
I noticed you like large clothing.

Uh, thanks, Claire.

[Prem] That's an automatic A, right?
Would be. If we needed it.

Nice. We're the Two-Tan Clan of math.

[Claire chuckles]
Good effort.

So, you hopping on the bus with us
back to Olive Garden?

Uh, I'll go ask my mom. Catch you later.

[rapping kid] Okay.

[kid beatboxing]

[rapping kid]
â™ª <i>Every day I do it like yo</i> â™ª


â™ª <i>My people see me doing it like yo</i> â™ª
[students] â™ª <i>Yo</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Everybody's trying to hear my flow</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>But when you step to me</i>
<i>You get the hands like no</i> â™ª

[students cheering, laughing]

[rapping kid]
â™ª <i>Yeah, okay, so we go</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>We rapping on the ones and twos</i>
<i>I'm chilling with me and my crew</i> â™ª

Hey.

â™ª <i>Yeah, here we go</i>
<i>See me on the TV show</i> â™ª

[beatboxing stops]

What?
Yo.

Who's that kid?
He's so little. Does he go here?

Let's see what you got, little man.


Come on, buddy.
You got it.

Come on, bro.
Yeah.

[beatboxing continues]

â™ª <i>Yeah</i>
<i>The name's Prem</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>That's what they call the kid</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It means love</i>
<i>Now you better give me all of it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My medulla's mythical</i>
<i>Like the Minotaur</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I never ate a beat before</i>
<i>But I like the taste, so give me more</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My pop's not here</i>
<i>But he's looking down</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Matter of fact, he's right next to me</i>
<i>He's all around</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>He's the one who gave me the mic</i>
<i>And showed me what to do with it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>So I'm about to break the beat down</i>
<i>Like my freaking humerus, uh</i> â™ª

Yeah! Okay.
[students cheer]

But that's his ulna.
Okay.

â™ª <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Here we go now</i> â™ª

[rapping continues indistinctly]

â™ª <i>When you've shown that</i>
<i>You're strong on your own</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Thought that you were alone</i>
<i>But you're wrong</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I've been here all along</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You've been runnin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Runnin' faster than I can let go</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It's a big world</i>
<i>But I keep my light on</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Guiding you home through the storm</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You've been runnin'</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Away from it all</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>But I want you to know</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You can always come home</i>
<i>To my arms</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh</i>
<i>All right</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh</i>
<i>Let's go</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i>I got so much to share</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Woke up with so many cares</i>
<i>But I don't see those anywhere</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I see the sun</i>
<i>I am the son</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Feel like my journey has just begun</i>
<i>Just begun</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I was no one</i>
<i>Now I'm a stallion and flying</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Joy is multiplying</i>
<i>And I'm on the run</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Got a new perspective</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Guess you could say</i>
<i>That it was cloudy</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>But now I think it finally might be</i>
<i>A good day</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>I was feeling low</i>
<i>Couldn't find my way</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Nowhere to go</i>
<i>I was lost in the fray</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Now I got a new perspective</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>And I guess you could say</i>
<i>That it was cloudy</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>But now I think it finally might be</i>
<i>A good day</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>They say heroes never die</i>
<i>And I hope that is true</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>'Cause that's the only way</i>
<i>I'll ever get back closer to you</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>They say that heroes never die</i>
<i>As long as they move the crowd</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>So that's what I'm doing now</i>
<i>Whoa, hope that I make you proud</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Oh, what a beautiful feeling</i>
<i>Free as a soaring eagle</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>I do it for love</i>
<i>Do it for family</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>For all the people</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>The sun is shining</i>
<i>We shooting stars</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>And the world is watching</i>
<i>There's no stopping</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>We at the top of the mountain</i>
<i>Never dropping</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>I was feeling low</i>
<i>Couldn't find my way</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Nowhere to go</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Lost in the fray</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>Got a new perspective</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>And I guess you could say</i>
<i>That it was cloudy</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>But now I think it finally might be</i>
<i>A good day</i> â™ª

[Suresh] â™ª <i>Dark</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>Feeling terrified</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Yeah</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>I looked in my heart</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Heart</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>Found a beat inside</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>Yeah</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>I went and turned it up</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>Yeah</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>And now it's amplified</i> â™ª

{\an8}-â™ª <i>Yeah</i> â™ª
â™ª <i>You know I've never been better</i> â™ª

{\an8}â™ª <i>I'm feeling so alive</i> â™ª

{\an8}[Suresh] â™ª <i>Uh-huh</i> â™ª
