[air whooshing]

[rings bouncing]

[dream-like music]

[doorbell dinging]

[shoes squeaking]


Everything's
gonna be just fine.



[tires screeching]

[calliope music]

gentlemen, boys and girls.

Welcome to the circus.

Please take a seat.

The show start will
start in two minutes.

Hey, where you going?

[audience applauding]

[upbeat music]


Pie!
Oh!

[audience laughing]

Woo!

Pie in the face!

[audience applauding]

[Booba laughing]

Who's the greatest? Me!


and gentleman,

wasn't that just about the
cutest thing you've ever seen?

Hey! What are you
doing out there?

I was hoping to try a
little bit of my new act.

No, no, no, no.

Everything goes
through me first.

Now clean yourself up,
go set my next gag,

and listen, no more
unfunny funny business!

All right, everybody,
gather around.

Come on, gather around.

All right.

See that person out there?

That's the mayor.

The mayor's got
to like the show.

If the mayor doesn't
like the show,

we don't get invited
back next year.

And if we don't get
invited back next year,

you don't get paid,

so let's go out there and
do a good show, shall we?

Oh-ho, and you two,

why don't you try
being funny for once?

You're not grave
diggers, you're clowns.

All right, everybody
back to work! Let's go!

Excuse me, boss, I have an act

I've been working
on for six years.

Hey, Boss.
What?

Can we do the geese
in the second part

of the show tonight
instead of the first?

No!
Okay.

Go away.
[duck quacking]

Now what were you saying?

I have a new act I've
been working on for-

Take that outside!

And I have a costume already.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.

Tonight's way too important
to try some new unknown act.

Yeah. You discuss it with him.

You two figure something out.

Jiminy Christmas.

Hold it.
No questions.

Clean up the horse...

[solemn music]

are you doing out there?

try being funny for once?

No, no, no, no.
Just go away.

[switch clicks]

[audience applauding]

[uplifting music]

Absolutely amazing!

And now, ladies and
gentleman, boys and girls,

welcome to the
center ring, Booba!

[audience applauding]
[upbeat music]

Ho-ho-ho. Hello!

Assistant!

[audience cheering]

[audience gasping]

Oh, oh!

[audience laughing]

Oh.

[sad clown music]

Oh.

[slow violin music]


Hey!


You've been in there
since we've left.

Give it a rest already.

It's a restroom,
that's what I'm doing.

Bus driver!

There's someone sleeping
in the bathroom again.

[dramatic music]

Hi.

Do you got a ticket, bub?

Uh, somewhere here.

Not here.

Not here.

Maybe I put it here. Hold on.

That's what I thought.
I know I have it.

[air whooshing]

Hey, hey, hey, where you going?

Come on!

[solemn music]

[bag whirring]

[upbeat music]

[dog barking]

[music stops]

[dog panting]

[dramatic organ music]

[dog barks]

[horn honks]

[brakes screech]

Which way did he go?

Thanks, dingus.

[soft music]

[downbeat music]

[Popovich snoring]

[officer groans]

Hey, dingus!

Can't sleep here!

Hey, can't sleep here!

Who is dingus?

Dingus, it's a derogatory term

for someone whose
name I don't know,

nor care to learn.

Not get out of here!

Hey, hey, get out of here!

[Popovich groaning]

Is this a thing?

If I just grab here, oh.

I don't want to hurt you,
I just want you to leave.

I think this is just
getting worse really.

No, that's not what....

[upbeat music]

Way too early for this!

It's way too early
for this! Go on!

Oh!

[dog barking]

Oh!

Ho, ho, ho, you little!

[officer groaning]

[officer groaning]

See later, goodbye!

Grab him!

[officer groaning]

[belt snaps]

[woman screaming]


[soft classical music]

[cat purring]

[dog panting]

What is that?

It appears to be a stray
animal of some description.

Yes. I see that.

What I don't see is you keeping
it well away from my statue!

Yeah, right.

Okay, hi. Can you shoo?

Go, can you leave
the area? Shoo.

Yes.

Good.

Be free.

[Susan sighs]

That's better.

I'd like some time alone with
the statue, Mr. Meaningsly.

Go fetch me something to drink.

[upbeat classical music]


See him, see where he went?

He was right here.

How does he
continue to evade us?

What are you two
oafs doing here?

Tuck in your shirts.

[Popovich grunting]


a real unsavory
character at the moment.

Say cheese.

Hey, stop it, get out of here.

Leave me alone!

Spend some time
alone with the statue.

Yes, ma'am. We'll
be on our way.

It's just that we
know he's in this park

and we're still looking for him

and I know that if
you come across him,

you're gonna like him
less than you like us,

because he's a true buffoon
and a rapscallion to boot.

I am not going
to ask you again!


[dramatic music]

[statue crashing]

Ah!

[upbeat music]

Oh, it's a little dog!

Ah!

That dog is a...

Oh!

I'm sorry, excuse
me, accident.

I'm gonna put everything back.

Here.

Oh! Something's missing.

Oops. I'm sorry.

This goes here.

Now there.

Ta-da!

[Susan screaming]

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

Ah!

Taxi, taxi!

[officer laughing]

[Popovich grunting]

This dingus, get
out of the way.

No, just pick a lane.

Get out of the...

Oh my gosh.

Gimme a break.

Well, well, well.

[Popovich yelling]

[dog barking]


[woman gasps]

[upbeat music]

It was horrible!

He's a monster!

You!

I'll destroy you!

Ah, gotcha!

You're free, get out of here!


[people yelling]

How'd you lose 'em again?
How did I lose 'em?!

Smoke and mirrors.
Idiots, are you kidding me?

Sorry, I'm so
sorry. We'll find him.

He was right here!
We'll get him,

I promise you.

doing this all day.


Shh, shh.

Who's a good doggy?

Who's a good doggy?

Where are you?

Where is that dog!

[car door opens]

[engine starts]

Hi.

[gavel bangs]

Listen up.

I'm gonna cut right to
the chase, Mr. Popovich,

you are in big trouble.

You've done a sizeable
amount of damage in this town

and you're not going anywhere

until you've paid
to have it fixed.

Now I know you're penniless,
just passing through,

don't have a place to
live, but around here,

a man works until he's
righted what he's done wrong.

So I'm gonna set you up with
a job and a place to stay

until you've paid for
all of the damages,

especially the statue.

Now there's a shack by an
old man Miller's house,

nobody's using it right now,

so you can stay
there for a while.

And first thing
tomorrow morning,

you're gonna go to this address

and start your brand new job.

It's not much, but it's
better than a jail cell.

He deserves a jail cell!

What kind of backwoods
justice is this?

He destroyed my statue.

And he's going to work until
he's paid to have it fixed.

I could have it
fixed tomorrow myself!

That's not the point.

I want him punished.

I'm still the judge in this
town and I've made up my mind.

He's gonna work until his debt
is paid off and that's final.

Without a time limit even?

Look at him.

Okay, Susan. Okay.

Mr. Popovich, I'm gonna
give you two weeks to prove

that you can keep a job

and be a functioning
member of society.

And if that broken statue is
not fixed in those two weeks,

you will go to jail.

Satisfied, Mrs. Meglopolos?

Fine.

[dramatic music]

Make sure everything that
can go wrong for him,

does go wrong.

Gather evidence that
we can use against him.

I will see him in a jail cell.

And Keep an eye on your dog.

If he gets into
any more trouble,

you'll be the one
that pays for it.

But this is not my dog.
Dismissed!

[Popovich yelling]

[soft music]

It's not Hollywood.

[chicken clucking]

Oh.

Hi, neighbor.

We got neighbor here.

[upbeat Italian music]

[birds chirping]

[door chiming]

Oh, hello.
Hello.

I do hope you're not
expecting a table for two.

Oh, no, no.

I'm here about the job.

Hey, sorry buddy. You
have to wait outside.

Stay out of trouble.

So the judge has sent you here

to work off a debt to the city.

Yes.

Marvelous.

Follow me.

[upbeat music]

Full staff meeting
in one minute.

Wait here.

Hi.

[staff clapping]

Okay, listen up, everybody.

I need to make sure that
you're very familiar

with today's specials.

Clean Carl, will you
go get the sample tray?

And we have a new employee,

a criminal who was assigned
to us against my will

by a judge I lost a bet to.

And I'm pretty sure he doesn't
know how to do anything.

Oh wait, wait.

We've seen them juggle, right?

But can you do anything useful?

[drum roll music]

[uplifting music]

[staff clapping]

Okay, yes. All right.

It's settled.

[dramatic music]

Dishes for you I'm afraid.

To the kitchen.

You'll know them
when you see them.

[laughing mischievously]

Back to work, everyone!

[sad trombone music]

What is wrong with you?

I'm sorry. It was accident.

I can't work like this.

I'm Clean Carl.

And I certainly don't
mean for my nickname

to become one of those
ironic nicknames.

I'm going home to change.

No one can see me leave.

Hi.

Hello.
Hi.

[suspenseful music]

Oh, well, how's
your day going?

Okay.

Excuse me, uh,

this can for the soup.

Yeah, that's a can of soup.

Oh, one more question,
uh, this plate dirty?

I have to wash it?

Yeah. You're the dishwasher.

You should wash the dishes.

Wait a second.

Should I wash both
sides or just only one?

Yeah, of course you
wash both sides...

Wait.

Are you joking with me?

Oh, yeah, you're
that new guy. Yeah.

Oh. Wow. Okay.

Get back to work, jokester.

Sheesh.

[fast music]

Perfect.

[silly bell music]

Are these your regular
business hours, my good man?

Yes. We just opened.

Mm, splendid.

I'll take a regular table

for a regular person
if you please.

[soft piano music]

Right this way, sir.
Mm.

You're waiter will
be right with you.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

[dramatic music]

[upbeat music]

Rex!

Rex!

Look.

[cat meows]

Oh, hi.

Hi.

You hungry?

Hey, look at.

[cat meows]

What are you doing!?


Sorry about that.

I couldn't resist.

So I'm not in trouble.

Oh, you're in
trouble all right.

I saw you get busted
by the cops yesterday.

This was yesterday.
I'm worried about today.

I liked your
tricks inside too.

Thank you.

Are you a magician?

Oh no, magician's
tricks cheat the audience.

I'm the juggler.

My tricks are real.

[Sarah clapping]

You should join the circus.

[record scratching]

I've got much bigger
plans than lousy circus.

Ah.

I'm on the way to Hollywood.

Ay!

Okay. Okay.

I better get back to work

before one of your
cool poses kills you.

[soft piano music]

Well, and fortunately for you,

we've added an
exciting new feature

to our dining experience.

If you will.

[drum roll music]

[uplifting horn music]

Nothing to see here.

Enjoy your meal.

Sarah, get the new guy in
here and clean this up.

[Sarah sighs]

This goes to table four.

[soft music]

Gustavio made a mess, he
wants you to clean it up.

Don't forget the mop, cool guy.

[water dripping]

[Clean Carl coughing]

Hey!

Oh, I bet you're
just loving this!

[dramatic music]

[cats meowing]

[dramatic music]

Just a regular old
restroom break. [chuckles]

Nothing fancy.

Big birthday today,
everyone gets a piece of cake.

Piece of cake.

Oh, yeah, piece of cake, yeah.

[upbeat music]

[Popovich singing]

[sad horn music]

[man grunting]

[upbeat horn music]

[woman laughing]

[Sarah screaming]

Oh, oh, stay behind me.

Ooh!


What have you done?

Nothing.

Don't go. Don't go. No, please!

[music slowly stops]

Oh.

Hey.

[man laughing]

Oh, wait, wait,
wait, whoa, whoa!

Hey, come on, guys!

I'm Clean Carl!

Wait, whoa, whoa~

No, no!

No, no!

[all laughing]

[soft music]

[cats meowing]

Hey! Get out of here!

Get out, get out, get out.

[Sarah laughing]

[air whooshing]

I brought you dessert.

[goat baaing]
[rooster crowing]

[loud banging]

Looks much better.

But you need some work.

[soft music]

Good boy. Good boy.

Good boy.

[Rex growling]

Hey, Rex, come here.

Would you like I
show you some tricks?

[Rex barking]
All right.

Sit right here
and watch closely.

Just simple broom.

But look, bam,

bam,

bam,

bam.

[kids clapping]

Oh, hi.


Watch closely.

Sit.

Sit.

Ta-da.

[kids clapping]

Now, up, up, up, up.

Yay!

Can you teach
my dog to do that?

Yeah.
Yeah, please!

Really?
Yeah!

[whistle blowing]

School time!

[kids cheering and clapping]

[upbeat music]

Oh, the board is dirty.

I need someone to help
me clean the board.

Please clean here,
also clean here.

Clean, clean, clean.

Very good.

And now I put my question
on the board and whoa!

[kids laughing]

Okay, now geography question.

Please come here and show me
where's the Pacific Ocean.

Just come and make a point

right here.

Very good!

Come back your seat, please.

Thank you very much, everybody.

[kids clapping]

Guys, this school is over
and everybody can go home.


Come on.
[dogs barking]

Oh, and you also can go home.

Thank you.
[cash register dinging]

Thank you.
[cash register dinging]

Thank you.
[cash register dinging]

Thank you.
[cash register dinging]

Goodbye.

I came to tell you
I found you a new job

if you're interested,

but looks like you
already found one.

[sad trombone music]

Maybe you better hear
me out after all.

It's a construction job.

A friend of mine said they
need an extra pair of hands.

Interested?
Of course!

Great! Just give him this.

Okay and can you
hold on one second?

I got something for you.

Oh.
Wait a second.

[soft music]

[horn hoking]
[duck quacking]

You know, you are so kind
and I really appreciate it

and I would like to give
you a small gift from me

and from my dog.
Oh! [laughing]

Oh, I'm sorry.

How about if I buy you dinner?

I don't know of any
restaurants that take buttons,

but you could walk
me home if you like.

[soft music]

So what are you going
to do once you fix this?

Headed to Hollywood.

[Sarah laughing]

Chasing your dreams, huh?
Yeah.

I used to have dreams once,

I kept putting them off
for tomorrow I guess.

It's never too late!

Look at me.

I'm dingus doofus
and still trying.

I guess so. [laughing]

Well, I better not
keep you up too late.

You gotta be up early
tomorrow for that new job,

construction hours.
Right.

And thank you again
for doing that.

You're welcome.

Have a good night.
Good night.

Oh, wait.

Don't break anything tomorrow.

I won't. I'm new man now.

Great.

[sad trombone music]

[bell dinging]

[upbeat music]

[phone ringing]

[phone ringing]

Hello?

I don't know, I don't work here.

Present for ya.
Oh.

If I can get your
autograph right here, please.

Autograph? Nice to meet a fan.

Uh, okay. Here you are.

Okay.
Enjoy.

Hey, excuse me.

I parked right out
here in the third spot.

Do you mind?

Oh, I don't mind.
Okay. Thank you.

It's okay with me.

Hey, I got a ton of
bricks and crap everywhere.

Where you want me to
unload these things?

[phone ringing]

Over there I guess.
All right, your call.

Hi-
Hold on.

Hello?

I agree with it.

Yes.

They never told me that either.

Hold on.

Hey, hey! Where you parking?

We parked there now.

Sorry, I have to call you back.

Some people have no
idea what's going on.

Excuse me.
Hold on, but it's line here.

Can I help you?
Yes. These are for Rusty.

I'm Rusty.
Oh, then this is for you.

Who are you?

Oh, no.

You got fired at the
restaurant, didn't you?

Well, you're lucky
that I have need

of a couple of hands today.

Okay.
We got an inspection coming

and everything needs
to be just perfect.

Okay.

Stay away from me and
we'll get along just fine.

Now, follow me.

Should I follow
you or stay away?

Follow me and then stay away.

Okay.

Foreman.
Yep?

Here's a new guy.

I want you to give me
an absolute worst jobs

you've got and by
the end of the day

make sure he's tired as a dog.

[western music]
[dog panting]

[dogs barking]

Get out of the house, run!

[Dog Catcher]
You won't get far!

It's not my first
day on the job.

First day on the job.

You're a weird little
guy, aren't you?

Aren't ya?

Oh!

Well, maybe we can at least
get you to dress right.

You're gonna need a hard hat.

What is it for?

It's for your head, dummy.

Why I need it?

You put it on your head,
it protects your brain.

Here. Hit me.

What?

Hit me?
Are you sure?

Yes, hit me


My head.

Like that?

[dramatic music]

Got ya! [grunting]

Hey knuckleheads, you're
supposed to move the bricks.

Forklift's broken.

Well, fix it or
move 'em by hand.

I don't really care.

Okay, guys, come on.

Whoa, no, no, no, you
stay here and lift. Okay?

Make sure he lifts the most.
Oh yeah.

Come on, guys.
All right, guys, come on.

From the knees.

Ready?

[men grunting]

All right.

Here we go.

Here we go.

[Popovich grunting]

What are you doing?

[upbeat music]

All right, guys.

I got to fix that forklift.

Come on, new guy.
Give me a hand.

Grab that cord. Do not
plug it in until I say to.

[spark crackles]

[soft music]

[man grunting]

[man gasping]

Oh, the smell!

The smell, the smell!

[western music]

I smell something.

Oh, right, that, that
makes sense. All right.

Where's that dog?

It's so bad.
Everything's okay.

It's so bad.

[dramatic music]

[drill whirring]

[dog catcher whistling]

I've got a great
little necklace for you.

[goat baaing]

[upbeat country music]

[dog catcher screaming]

Don't poke me, don't poke me!

I'm sorry.

Okay.

[man grunting]

Oh! [groaning]

[upbeat music]

[sneaky music]

[upbeat music]

Ready? Pull!

[Dog Catcher] Ugh! I'm
so tired of falling down.

[man yelling]

Hey! Why are these
bricks still here?

The forklift's-
Get them out of here.

The inspector's here.

Come on, guys. You heard him.

Get these bricks out of here.

Up and out, let's go. Come on!

Use your backs, guys. Come on.

This way.
This way.

This way.
This way.

[soft music]

This way, this way!

[Popovich clapping]

We did it!
Not long enough?

Circus boy, get up
there and tie it off.

[sad trombone music]

Can somebody get
him a rope, please?

Now, tie it off.
Hold it, guys.

[Construction Manager]
All right, good.

They're coming.
All right, guys.

We're tied off
good. We're tight.

I got it.
It's good!

[soft music]

We're so happy
to have you here.

All right, they
really are coming.

Let's go. Act natural. Come on.

Put this on.

What?

Huh?

What?

Hey, hey! Untangle me! Untie me!

Let me show you the things
that are perfectly safe.

Come on.

[Popovich grunting]

This the fire extinguisher.

We've had it here for so long.

They need to be re-certified
on a regular basis.

Yeah, but look
at this ceiling.

See that waterproof ceiling?

It's waterproof.

I see holes in the ceiling.

If there were
holes on the ceiling,

water would fall on our heads.

[sad trombone music]

[dog catcher groaning]

[kids laughing]

Unlock it.
You're free! Hurry!

[fast country music]



Run, run.
Go, go, get out of here.

Run!
[dogs barking]

We need to have ventilation.

Ventilation...

The ceiling is
completely waterproof.

[Popovich screaming]

What was that?

[air whooshing]

[dog barking]

I bet you want me
to let you go, huh?

Huh?

Hey, let me go! Let me go!

Nothing. Look at the ceiling.

[air whooshing]

holes in the ceiling.

Look out!

Help! Help!

Help! Help!

What!

[kids laughing]

[everyone yelling]

Now it goes up.

That's it.
Oh!

You can stand up.

I'm sorry.

Did you see this?

What's wrong with you?

You saw this.
I tried to save your life.

From what?
What are you doing?

Because uh...

Go to the office
and wait for me.

I can't even look
at you right now.

[soft music]

What are you looking at?

[engine starts]

This isn't over.

When one door opens,
another cage closes.


[silly upbeat music]

Ho-ho, my hands were dirty,
but now they're totally clean.


Oh, and they smell great too.

Oh, I love soap,
don't you? [laughing]

[dramatic music]
[toilet bubbling]

[Popovich sighs]

Excuse me.

I'm sorry, office is closed.

I have to get in.

Uh, bad idea.

I'm an-
[window clangs]

[upbeat music]

[Mr. Meaningsly laughing]

[inspector screaming]

Oh!

[air whooshing]

Ah!

[crickets chirping]

[upbeat music]

[film whirring]

[man singing in
foreign language]

What are you doing here?

Oh, um,

I'm sorry to just pop by,

but I have something
exciting to tell you.

Pfft.

How did everything go at
your construction job today?

Great. Fantastic.

It's a smashing success.

Well, I found you
an even better job.

A film director came
into the restaurant today

and told me they're shooting
a movie in town tomorrow.

I asked her if there
are any job openings

and he said they needed
extras, background actors.

It's the bottom of
the acting totem pole

but at least there'll be
one step closer to Hollywood

right here while you're stuck.

Wait a second.

That fancy man was
a film director?

And you got me job in the movie.

What?

Thank you.

[Sarah laughing]

[upbeat music]

[people chattering]

[sad trombone music]

Hi.
Hey, here as an extra?

Yes.

You've got a great
looking weird face there.

Thank you.

Might be a good Butler.

What do you think?

Hey, I think he would.

Ha, weird looking
face, follow me.

Butler, butler.

Put this on.

All right, so come in tight.

To the window to the wall.

That's it.

[fast music]

Wow.

Hey! Don't do that.

Oh, great!

The butler's here.

Have we met before?

No, not at all.

Not at all.

Heh, well, you look familiar.

Desert Rose 1G,
scene 12, take one.

And

action!

Madam,

Mr. Her, Mr. Her, Mr...

Cut!
Okay, I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

One more time.

I'm sorry. Excuse me,

One more time.



[soft music]

Madam, Mr. Hender-

Cut!

Mr. Butler man, do
you see that door?

Yeah.
That door's your friend.

Stay right by the door.

Okay.
You got it?

And

action!

[soft music]

Madam, Mr. Henderberg is here.

[coo coo birds chirping]

Darling.

How I've-
Cut!

Mr. Butler.
Yes?

Are you okay?
Yes.

Can you continue?
Yes, of course I can.

The door is no longer
your friend. Okay?

No more friend.
You hate the door.

Yes.
Okay.

Action!

[soft music]

Madam.

Cut!

Did you slam the door because
I said you hate the door?

Yes.

Okay. Forget that.

Forget all your feelings
towards the door.

'Cause you've
never met the door.

You don't care about
the door. You got that?

Okay.
Just stay on this side.

This side?
This side right here.

Action!

Madam, Mr. Henderberg is here.

Cut!

Let's get a new vase
in here, please.

[sneaky music]

Okay. All right, all right.

No more botany. We're done here.

You're done. Thank
you very much.

Listen, don't go there.

Don't go here.

Stay there.

You got it? You're glued there.

You understand? Do not move.

Okay.
All right.

Let's do it again.

All right.

[Popovich sighing]

And rolling.

Action!

[Popovich sighing]

Madam, Mr. Henderberg is here.

[soft music]

Darling.

How I have missed you.

Our time apart has
haunted me to finally,

finally see your face again.

Cut!

30.

Action!

[soft music]

Madam, Mr. Henderberg here.
Cut!

[man sighs]

121.

[soft music]

Madam, Mr.-
Darling!

How I have missed you.

To finally look upon,

to finally look upon your face

after all this
time, makes me feel.

[woman gasps]

Cut!

Ah!

Hey you, you owe
the lady an apology.

Apologize!

Okay. I'm so sorry.

[man grunting]

Hey, stop, stop, stop!

Boys, boys, boys,
we're all friends here.

No one has to get mad.

Look, our insurance
doesn't cover this stuff,

so we're just gonna stop it.

Stay where you are!
Listen, listen.

Listen, it's not worth it.

We don't the cops here, okay?
All right, fine!

Be careful.

All right. Come here, guys.

We've got to work
together now. Okay?

You need to focus.

And I'm going to make
this up to you I promise.

And you, we will talk later.

So just why don't you
two review your scene

and I'm gonna talk
to this gentlemen.

Now listen to me, Butler.

I have had enough of this!

We're gonna do this
take one more time.

You understand?

One more time!

And you are gonna stand
there and finish the scene.

Please do not touch my coat.

All right?

Now, listen, I am here-


[goofy upbeat music]

That's it!

Hey!

Hmm!

Is that yours?
What?

[drum roll music]

[upbeat music]
[man grunting]

[all gasping]

Look out!
[woman screaming]

[Mr. Meaningsly whistling]

I'm okay!

I'm okay!

[Popovich yelling]

[air whooshing]

Ah!

[soft solemn music]

[dogs barking]

[alarm wailing]

[Rex barking]

Stop giving me stuff.

I don't want it.

[metal clanging]

[dog whining]


Rex, why did I teach
you how to knock?


I quit.


Who am I kidding?

I am the worst.

I'm just doofus dingus.

[Sarah sighs]

Come on, the world has all
the cool guys it can stand.

It needs more to doofus dinguses

to speak for the rest of us.

Stop helping me.

I can help whoever I like.

I'm not gonna let you quit.

Okay. I'm not quit.

I got fired.

I got fired from
the construction

and I got fired from
every job I ever had.

Why do you think that is?

For doing my best.

I don't think anyone ever
got fired for doing their best.


Start from the beginning.

Tell me everything
that's happened.

[Popovich sighs]

Okay.

First of all, the first
day, very first day.

And then I trashed the
house and that's everything.

I'm gonna repeat some of
the bullet points back to you

and I want you to tell
me how they sound.

Okay?

Okay.

Your boss at the circus

wouldn't let you do
the act you wanted

so you sabotaged him
in front of everyone,

which accidentally caused
the circus to be blacklisted

from an important town

endangering the jobs of
everyone who worked there.

It doesn't sound that good

from another point
of view, does it?

Not at all.

Listen, you've had a lot
of bullies in your life

and that's tough, but
you can't just be a jerk

every time someone's
a jerk to you.

If everyone did that, the
world would be full of jerks.

You've got to stop the cycle
of comic mischief revenge.

What should I do?

You've got to be nice.

To jerks?
It's worth a try.

Who is the biggest
jerk in your life?

Try thinking about what
is making them so angry

and see if you can think
of a way to help them.

Do something nice for the
biggest jerks in your life.

[soft music]

[upbeat music]

Huh?

What the...

[doorbell rings]

I saw everything.

[gavel bangs]

[sad trombone music]

You know that
movie you ruined?

They sent the head
of the studio here.

You're in trouble.

Hey, buddy.

Your Honor, as everybody
knows, my name is Clean Carl.

And now my worst fear
has been realized.

My name is now ironic.

Your Honor, I have here

several very serious
safety violations

against this man.

He made me wash my hat.

And it was too much soap.

Everything he touches
is just destroyed.

My next horror film
is going to be titled,

"The Clown with the Dog."

[western music]

[dog panting]

He kicked me and
I dropped my pizza.

I had my assistant
put together a video

that will prove beyond a doubt
that this man is a menace.

Mr. Meaningsly, roll the tape.

[wheels squeaking]

[tape whirring]

[upbeat music]

â™ª Popovich, he's
a really bad guy â™ª

â™ª He gets food on the ceiling â™ª

â™ª Makes it fall on your face â™ª

â™ª 'Cause that's the
kind of guy he is â™ª

â™ª And when he's got a mop â™ª

â™ª He gets water in your soup â™ª

â™ª And even if you're gonna
still eat it any way â™ª

â™ª Starts a fight in
your restaurant â™ª

â™ª Gets cats and dogs
in the kitchen too â™ª

â™ª He's a really bad guy â™ª

â™ª Might hit you in the eye â™ª

â™ª Might electrocute
your friends â™ª

â™ª What you gonna do then â™ª

â™ª He might mess up everything
that you're working on â™ª

â™ª On the movie set, knock
the camera on the ground â™ª

â™ª Then look around,
knock everything else on the ground too â™ª

â™ª He's a really bad guy â™ª

â™ª When he starts running â™ª

[all laughing]

[tape whirring]

That was the video
I was going to play.

But here's the full story.

[upbeat music]

â™ª Popovich is a
really great guy â™ª

â™ª Who does all kind of
really great things â™ª

â™ª Like giving you flowers â™ª

â™ª You might think it's from someone
else, but it's from him â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Popovich
is really nice â™ª

â™ª And he does other
really nice things too â™ª

â™ª Like making you fall in love â™ª

â™ª And falling in love
really is pretty cool â™ª

â™ª And he does that for you â™ª

â™ª And some other
cool things too â™ª

â™ª 'Cause he's really nice â™ª

â™ª Maybe one day he'll
give you a hat â™ª

â™ª When your other hat is dirty â™ª

â™ª Or clean your clothes â™ª

â™ª And even maybe wipe
something off your car â™ª

â™ª 'Cause he's just
a nice like that â™ª

â™ª And he just does really
nice things for everyone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause he's a
really nice guy â™ª

â™ª So who was the
nicest guy ever â™ª

â™ª It's Popovich â™ª

I watched Popovich do
one of the hardest things

a person can do, change.

[uplifting music]

And because it's one of
the hardest things to do,

it's also, I think, one
of the greatest things

about being human,

that we can learn
from our mistakes

and make a change
for the better.

Popovich did that.

And even better,

it inspired me to
do the same thing.

I'm done with this comic
mischief style revenge.

And I'm going to
start helping people.

I hope this video
helps Popovich.

I want to help too.

I'll pay for all of
his moron's debts.

The justice system works.


I'm a great judge.

I turned a crummy jerk
criminal into a sweetheart.

I'm wise.

Courts adjourned.

Popovich, you're
free to leave town.

[gavel bangs]

[everyone clapping]

[Popovich sighs]

[Sarah cheering and laughing]

You're welcome.

[door chimes]

[shoes squeaking]

[Popovich sighs]

Everything's
gonna be just fine.

[Popovich screaming]

Where going?

Hey!

[tires screeching]

[solemn music]

Do you know who I am?

I saw everything that happened
in that video he played.

You destroyed everything.

The entire set, the boom
pole, even the camera.


It was so funny.

I loved it.

I'll tell you right now

it was the best demo
reel I've ever seen

because you were funny
and it's hard to be funny,

but you're funny.

And I'm want to put you in
my studios next picture.

You're not gonna kill me?

No.

This is just the show
you that I mean business.

Hey, I'm a theatrical guy, man.

Ah, okay.
Get used to it.

You're in a movie
business now, pal!


Killing me, killing me.


[soft music]

[upbeat music]

Popovich has arrived.

[shoes squeaking]

[upbeat music]

â™ª So if you're blue â™ª

â™ª And you don't know
where to go to â™ª

â™ª Why don't you go
where fashion sits â™ª

â™ª Puttin' on the Ritz â™ª

This guy?

â™ª Different types
who wear a daycoat â™ª

[people chattering]

â™ª Perfect fits â™ª

â™ª Mm, puttin' on the Ritz â™ª

â™ª That's where each and
every lulu bell goes â™ª

Quiet on the set!
Okay, here we go.

Slate, please.

Scene 45, take one.

[rolling drumming]

[suspenseful music]
[man panting]

Go, move.

[heart thumping]

Smile.

Smile.

â™ª In the air â™ª

â™ª High hats and
arrowed collars â™ª

â™ª Wide spats and
lots of dollars â™ª

â™ª Spending every dime â™ª

â™ª Spending every dime â™ª

â™ª Spending every dime â™ª

That's beautiful.

Sure.

â™ª Spending every dime â™ª

â™ª For a wonderful time â™ª

â™ª If you're blue
and you don't know â™ª

â™ª Where to go to,
why don't you go â™ª

â™ª Where fashion sits â™ª

â™ª Puttin' on the Ritz â™ª

[woman groans]

â™ª Different types,
who wear a day coat â™ª

â™ª Pants with stripes,
and cut away coat â™ª

[man groans]
We should cut, right?

No.

This is exactly what I want.

[upbeat music]

â™ª Tips his hat just like
an English chappie â™ª

â™ª To a lady with
a wealthy pappy â™ª

Okay, dancers, please.

â™ª Very Snappy â™ª

â™ª You'll declare
it's simply topping â™ª

[Popovich screaming]
[record scratches]

[studio owner laughing]

[upbeat music]

[Studio Owner] I love it, man.

Dancers, go!

[man grunting]

Pie!

[all laughing]
[Sarah cheering]

Woo-hoo!

[upbeat music]

[audience cheering]

[audience applauding]

[music slowing to stop]

[suspenseful music]

What?

You don't like it?

[upbeat music]

[audience applauding]

[air whooshing]

[audience cheering]

I have something to show you.

Please stay right here.

Okay?

One.

Wow! [laughing]

Oh my gosh, did you make this?

Yes, yes.
It's incredible.

Yes this is-
I love it.

[Rex barking]

[engine rumbling]
