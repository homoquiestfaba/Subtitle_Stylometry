NARRATOR: The future.

Los Angeles.

Guns are outlawed.

Capital punishment abolished.

Now, crime rules.

Too bad cops aren't
allowed to carry guns.

That's the rules.

NARRATOR: Meet Tucker.

He's a renegade cop.

New rules.

NARRATOR: He's just
reinstated the death penalty.

David Heavener in
Twisted Justice.

I want that suspect
down here now!

And that's an order!

I always follow orders.

You're supposed to bring
these psychotics in alive.

Not blow them away.

I have to be alive
to do my job, sir.

Oh shit.

Mrs. Claudia Granger, wife of
prominent businessman, Howard

Granger, and co-owner of
the Downing Corporation

Has been found brutally murdered
in the hills above the city.

The bizarre bullseye drawn
with the victim's own blood

Suggests to investigators that
the murder maybe related...

Cage wants to talk to you.

About what?

They found another bullseye.

TUCKER (VOICEOVER): Eagle, I a...
A car out at the Granger scene,

Immediately.

Tucker, I can't read you.

TUCKER (VOICEOVER):
Die, you son of a bitch!

FEMALE (VOICEOVER): Who are you?

Um, this is officer
James Tucker.

The notorious James Tucker?

You know, there's a rumor
going around that you

Have an illegal weapon.

I have gun.

This is a gun.

Freeze!

TUCKER (VOICEOVER): Gilmore!

[Music plays]

[Theme music]

NARRATOR: No one
thought it would happen.

This is the future, Los
Angeles, California.

In an effort to stem the
rising tide of crime,

Congress has passed an anti-gun
law, forbidding the manufacture

And sale of firearms.

No one can carry a gun,
not even the police.

[Sirens blaring]

[Sirens die down]

This is Ward, Commander Gates.

Evacuate everyone to
a three-mile radius.

Keep the news crews standing by.

If this thing goes
our way, I want

Them brought back in first.

What've you got?

The LRP scan indicates
a high probability

This bomb is plastique.

And it's located at
the top of that tower.

And our suspect?

He's still sitting up
there with the bomb, sir.

Sir, let me take him, huh?

I can hit him.

You still the remote detonator?

Just like a baby
holding a rattle.

Sir, I can hit this guy.

Come on sir, let
me take him, huh?

Yeah, and you miss?

Kiss half this city goodbye.

No thank you.

I called in the psyche squad.

Called in the
psyche squad, sir?

Why would you do that?

Psychotic plants a bomb in the
middle of petroleum refinery

In the middle of the city an
says he's gonna blow it up

Unless we execute some
demons that are hunting him?

I think that's a fucking
desperate situation here,

Don't you think, Morris?

Yes, sir.

Who we calling in, sir?

Tucker.

Tucker?

Oh, come on.

We can't be that desperate, sir.

I mean, the guy's a
fuckin' psycho, all right?

Well then, I guess it
takes one to catch one.

Anybody see this
son of a bitch?

Yeah, there he
is right now, sir.

FEMALE (OVER RADIO):
Alpha, Charlie, Baker.

Tucker do you read?

Alpha to Gauge.

I've lost complete
communication with Tucker.

Merryweather 4-11, do you read?

This is Charlie, Alpha, Benson.

Come in, please.

Well hello, Tucker.

Looks like shit, as usual.

Thank you, Kelsey.

Where is the loon?

He's over there.

In the Tower.

Now, listen Tucker.

You're not gonna make
him mad, are you?

I mean, he's got a bomb with a
remote detonation in the tower

There.

And all... all these pipes
here are full of natural gas.

Relax, commander.

I'm just gonna talk to the man.

Yeah, well the detonator's
a radio transmitter.

Just get away from him so
he can't trigger the bomb,

All right?

[Speaks spanish]

What the hell are
you lookin' at?

Get outta here.

[Music plays]

Hinkle, do you read me?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
Read you, Sweetie.

Hinkle, you know I
hate being called that.

Would you just, uh,
stick to business

And read me the stats, please?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
Well, incident analysis

Was based on initial eyewitness
reports and FBI toxic data,

But the computer's guessing
your man is Luther Pantelli,

Ex-Army demolitions expert.

Medical discharge.

And the psyche
profile's borderline.

The army says he
stole some plastic,

But they can't prove it.

No busts since he's been out.

He's been working as a chauffeur
at the Chrysalis Agency

For the last eight months.

Real high-rent job.

Any priors before the Army?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
NED [inaudible].

The on-site scans indicate
there's enough plastic in that

Bomb to fly you to the moon.

So I'd walk on
eggshells if I were you.

Otherwise, It's been
nice workin' with you.

Well, if I get
vaporized, Hinkle, would

You remember to feed my doggy?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
You don't have a dog.

Yeah, well that let's
you off the hook.

[Radio beeps]

This is Gauge, do you read?

Uh, yes sir, I do.

GAUGE (OVER RADIO): Quit
screwin' around, Tucker,

Get it done.

Uh, yes sir, I will.

And this time don't make a
scene, just follow orders.

I always follow orders, sir.

Whoa.

Jackson.

[Speaking gibberish]

I'm the police negotiator, pal.

Now, you wanted to talk
to somebody in charge?

Well, I'm it.

You done got made
and then shit.

Thank you.

Now, look.

I'm empowered to represent
the people of this city.

You wanted to negotiate,
well... start talkin'.

I want you to do exactly
what I tell you to do

When I want you to do it then!

All right, all right.

Now look, I push
this little button,

And you know what
might happen, Jackson?

Huh?

Yeah.

You're gonna blow me, you,
and the rest of these people

To Kingdom Come.

[Speaking non-english]
You're not afraid, huh?

No.

Why not?

'Cause I know, you and me,
we can work this thing, see?

Now, you just tell
me what you want.

I want you to take these
demons away from me, man.

And, uh... like, uh...

Gave this bomb, now.

And it's, like... like a drag,
all this shit around me, man.

You know, maybe you were
a demon yourself, huh?

Maybe you've got a
demon inside of you.

Tucker, what are talkin' about?

Well, I mean, uh... endangering
the lives of a whole city

Of innocent people.

That sounds pretty demonic
to me, how about you?

All you have to do is give
me that detonator, pal.

Why?

Why should I do that?

To prove you're
not one of them.

How else can I trust you?

Come on.

Give me the detonator.

Come on.

No gun.

You know... Goddamn,
you're a good guy!

Give me the detonator.

Come on.

Get outta here.


Yeah, just a while.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Sleep tight, pal.

Commander Gauge?

Read you Tucker.

Is it safe to come in?

He's out cold.

You can bring the
circus in now, sir.

These tranquilizer
guns work great.

This guy was tough,
but I got him.

GAUGE (OVER RADIO): Where's
the suspect, Tucker?

They're setting up the cameras.

Reporters are being
brought in now.

Is everything under control?

Not quite yet, sir.

You get the maniac
out here so we

Can have a photo opportunity.

Right away, sir.

Do you think we
can talk about this?

Oh, Mr. Barnes.

I'll kill you all.

I'm gonna kill you all!

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you!

Tucker!

Guess what I have?

I have a gun.

Wrong This is a gun.

I want the suspect
down here now!

And that's an order!

I always follow orders.

Oh, dammit.

I can't see now.

Why don't you warn me next time?

And your right leg some more.

How's that?

OK, that's 10 poses.

Now let's get to the main event.

Ow!

What is this stuff?

Oh, it tastes like... shit.

Oh!

OK.

That's it.

Now, put the camera down.

And let's get into bed.

Well, come on.

I've got another customer.

A regular.

And he don't like waiting.

Oh, I get it.

So you're the shy type?

Now look, Buster this blood
crap was your idea, not mine.

But I tell you what.

I'll let you lick it off my
body for an extra $20 bucks?

That won't be necessary.

Hey, pud-knocker, it's
supposed to be $40 bucks.

Keep the change.

Yeah, what change?

Your life.

TUCKER (VOICEOVER):
I followed orders.

What the hell more
do you want from me?

[Speaking spanish]

I don't understand
Spanish, sir.

I want you to do your job.

You're an ordinary cop, Tucker.

You have been
trained in psychology

As well as forensics.

You're supposed to bring
me psychotics in alive,

Not blow them away.

I have to be alive
to do my job, sir.

I mean, last I heard, it
was still legal for a police

Officer to defend himself?

That's right, but
not with a gun.

Now, I have been covering for
you before this because you

Are a damn good cop.

But I am through
being jacked around.

Now I want that hand cannon
on my desk tomorrow morning.

You have been issued
an authorized weapon.

I expect you to use it.

OK, OK.

Commander, before we
settle the gun issue,

Can we talk about
Luther Pantelli

And what the lab boys say?

The autopsy reports says
that he was pumped full

Of D-7 His body was like jello.

I pumped three
shots into this guy

And he still kept
coming after me.

You know, he's gotta be
on some new kind of drug.

Well if he is, uh,
we'll know that when

The rests of the tests come in.

Is it also, sir?

No.

I want that gun.

If you can't find, send
somebody over to help you look.

Well, I appreciate that, sir.

Oh, you appreciate that, huh?

Mi amigo, one of these days,
I may have to put you away.

Uh, sir, that'
wouldn't be a good idea.

Why?

Well, it, um... it wouldn't
be good PR for the department.

[Indistinct chatter]


Yes, Mrs. Granger?

What's your name again?

Adams.

Adams.

I can't call out on this phone.

I don't even get a dial tone.

Well, I don't know
about such things.

But when we get you
home, I'll look at it.

Is Luther under the weather?

You could say that.

I was assigned by the
agency to replace him.

I see.

Are you sure you know the way?

Yes, Mrs. Granger.

I'm sure.

All these parties and
everything that my husband has,

I don't really care
about that, you know?

It's just bullshit.

I... I could live in
a $2 million home.

I don't need this.

And... And I can work.

You know?

I'm not helpless.

I can do a little sushi
thing that's just beautiful.

Adams?

Are you sure you know
where you're going?

Yes, Mrs. Granger.

Where are we?

I don't know this area at all.

What are we doing up here?

Hey.

What you doin' there, Freud?

Hm?

You hungry, huh?

Want a jelly donut?

Yeah.

In you go.

Yeah.


Hi-40 is the exciting
new way to begin your day.

[Music playing]

Hello, handsome.

Are you looking for a good time?

'Cause if you are,
Mona finds you.

Ooh.

Mona, Mona.

Do you want Mona?

If you do, please dial...

MALE (OVER TV): Clarence!

Clarence!

Clarence!

Help me, Clarence!

Get me back.

Get me back.

I don't care what happens to me.

Get me back to my wife and kids.

Help me, Clarence.

Please!

Please!

I want to live again.

MALE (OVER TV): We
interrupt this program

For a special bulletin.

Mrs. Claudia Granger, wife of
prominent local businessmen

Howard Granger and co-owner
of the Downy Corporation

Has been found brutally murder
in the hills above the city.

So far police say there are
no known suspects in the case.

The bizarre bullseye drawn
with the victims own blood

Suggests to investigators
that the murder

May be related to
the slaying of Mrs.

Jennifer Graham two weeks ago.

Her torso was slashed in a
pattern of concentric circles.

The police are so far
denying any connection

With the similar
murder of Mrs. Jennifer

Graham, whose body was also
marked with a bloody bullseye.

Mr. Granger has posted a
$10,000 reward for information

About this crime.

Please call the police
at the number you see

At the bottom of the screen.

I'm Bryan Thomas for INN news.

Now back to our regular program.


All right, all
right, all right.

Well, hello boys.

I though Halloween was over.

Fuck you, Tucker.

You know, Kelsey, you
really need to learn how

To express your inner feelings.

And as for you, Morris,
you need to learn how

To keep 'em bottled up inside.

Gauge wants to see you.

Oh, well, I was just on my way.

Uh, OK.

What are you guys
gonna do, carry me?

No, we're gonna frisk you.

You know, Kelsey,
I always thought

You had homoerotic tendencies.

Fuck you, Tucker.

OK, what are you
guys looking for?

An illegal drone.

Yeah, you got a warrant?

Now I'm gonna search
your apartment.

Hey Kelsey, while you're at
it, will you make up my bed?

Fuck you.

You're the spokesperson.

You tell 'em what
they wanna hear.

Tell 'em we got some leads
and we're checking them.

[Speaks spanish]

Send that son of
a bitch in here.

Take a seat, officer.

Thank you, sir.

You look like you
slept in the toilet.

Thank you, sir.

Did you read the Graham
and Ranger reports yet?

Uh, yes, sir.
I did.

Good.

'Cause you're on the case.

This is top priority.

If you trip on your dick, the
whole department stumbles.

Anything else, sir?

Yeah.

Got the final results of
Luther Pantelli's autopsy.

You were right.

It's a new chemical.

The lab boys think it's
a distant cousin to PCP.

They code named it Hombra.

It partly neutralized
the muscle relaxant.

That's why he kept coming.

Accelerates the metabolism.

Collects in the cerebrium...

What?

The part of the brain that
controls the intelligence.

Yeah, well if you like
that, you'll love this.

Possible description.

A hooker called it in.

Said some John paid her to
pose in the same position

We found the victim.

Even used phony blood to
draw the bullseye pattern.

Could be a wacko imitating
the Graham killing.

Or our suspect has been
practicing for another kill.

I got Hinkle running
cross-refs on the face,

But no positive ID.

If this is our man, we got a
turbo-charged fruit loop here.

And he is the whole enchilada.

The connection between Luther
Pantelli and our killer.

I want you working
in isolation on this.

Nobody except you, me
and Hinkle will know

This guy could be a repeater.

Otherwise, the media will blow
this thing out of proportion

And make this job a bigger pain
in the ass than it already is.

I'm the wrong man
for the job, sir.

What are you talking about?

I mean the suspect probably
slipped Luther Pantelli

The drug to whack him out.

Which means he knew the
Grangers well enough

To know when Mrs. Granger
was getting back into town

And who their chauffeur was.

That's premeditated murder.

That's murder one.

That means I'm the
wrong man for the job.

I only handle crazies.

Our suspect still fits the
legal profile of a crazy.

And you're the best man
to predict his pattern

And bring him in
so he doesn't have

A chance to act it out again.

But no other cops and
no press, except Hinkle.

Now, you'll have priority access
on your usual coded frequency.

Anything else?

Yeah.

Well?

What am I supposed to do
when I run into this geek?

Tap dance?

You listen to me, Tucker.

I'm not going to alter
anymore autopsy reports

Just to cover your ass.

If you shoot somebody
for any reason,

I'm gonna turn you
over to the wolves.

All right?

Bad PR or not.

Now, you're gonna be
issued a new stinger.

Used properly, that
you do the trick.

Look, if the suspect
is taking the same drug

Luther Pantelli is, these
tranquilizers won't do diddly.

We're not as dumb as
you think we are, Tucker.

The lab boys doubled the dosage.

A couple of well-placed
shots should do the trick.

That should be enough.

Anything else?

No, what more could a guy want?

Get this slime, Tucker.

Before he has the
chance to kill again.

That M all look like clowns.

Yeah, we wouldn't wanna
start a trend, now would we?

Excuse me, I wanna talk to
you about Luther Pantelli.

Andrea, I don't have time.

Besides, it's over
and done with.

Not quite.

This case has been assigned to
my committee for investigation.

Um, Mrs. Andrea Layton.

She's with the
prosecutor's office.

And chairperson of some, uh,
arrest procedure committee

Or something like that.

We're city-authorized
watchdog committee rooting out

Those officers who
have not yet adjusted

To new arresting procedures.

And if we don't stop these
abuses against suspects,

We won't be able
successfully prosecute.

Who are you?

Uh, this is officer
James Tucker.

The notorious James Tucker?

You know, there's a
rumor going around

That you have an illegal
weapon and used it to violate

Luther Pantelli's civil rights.

That's very funny.

Isn't that funny, Commander?

The lab tech in forensics
says the autopsy was altered.

His body was cremated.

So you squeaked by this
time, but next time

I'm gonna put you away.

Yeah, why don't you try putting
the criminals away, Ms. Layton?

Oh, I've put a lot
criminals away, Mr. Tucker.

Yeah, you put 'em
out in the clinics,

You give 'em a few
behavior mod shots

And, boom, they're out
cruising the streets again.

It's not my fault.
That's the law.

No, that's compromise.

You can't take the heat,
get out of the system.

Why don't I start by
getting out of the room?

Hinkle, come in.

Hinkle, do you have
a match for me yet?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO): Um,
not yet, but the composites

Being sent [inaudible] over.

[Radio distorted]

Hinkle, you're breaking up.

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
With who, baby?

I'm not going with anyone.

You're the only one I want.

I mean your
signal's breaking up.

HINKLE (OVER RADIO): Oh,
you must be entering an NRA.

A what?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
Non-Receive Area.

We could lose
contact for a while.

That would break my heart.

Hinkle, have you ever thought
about going out with women?

HINKLE (OVER
RADIO): Not my type.

Right what about the blood?

HINKLE (OVER RADIO):
Um, type A-Neg.

She must've scratched
him because they found

Him under her fingernails.

TUCKER (OVER RADIO): OK,
keep me posted, buddy.

HINKLE: Love to.

Oh, by the way.

I make a great meat loaf.

When are you coming over
to my house for dinner?

TUCKER (OVER RADIO):
When I decide to get

Nice my sex-change operation.

You don't know
what you're missing.

I make a great spinach quiche.

Thank you, Hinkel.

Over and out.

Over and out.

[Music playing]

I

[Radio beeps]

Eagle, this is Tucker.

I'm out at the Granger scene,
and guess what I found?

A vital piece of evidence
with a suspect to match.

TUCKER (OVER RADIO): Hinkle,
I need a... a car out a, uh...

Tucker, I can't read you.

Hinkle, do you copy?

Tucker...

Hinkle!

Hinkle, if you read me, I need a
back up unit out at the Granger

Scene immediately.

I'm going after the suspect.

Tucker, I can't read you.

You lookin' for something, pal?

[Music plays]

Die, you son of a bitch!


Shit.

Hey man!

What do you think you're doing?

Hey, this is private property.

What are you, crazy?

[Music plays]


Shit!


[Music plays]

Oh shit.

[Radio beeps]

This is priority code
Alpha-Larry-Tucker EF-876.

Hinkle, do you read?

TUCKER (OVER RADIO): I've
got the suspect and physcal

Evidence linking
him to the crime.

Are you all right?

I am now.

Hey, uh, thanks for worrying.

I do worry, Sweetie.

Got a lot of
circumstantial here

Indicating the psycho status
congruent for the required

Motives of the crime.

What does that mean?

It means the bastard probably
killed Graham and Granger both.

Open and shut case.

You'd better have them
send a squad out here

To the old chemical factory.

And you better tell 'em to
send along some more tranqs

While you're at it.

Hey, Tucker.

I've been workin' this
department for two years.

When are we gonna meet?

Over and out.

MALE (ON PHONE): Tell officer
Tucker he did a damn good job.

Yes, sir.

I'll tell him, sir.

Thank you, sir.

of a bitch in here.

Have a seat.

Take a donut.

The commissioner
can't believe how

Quick you brought this guy in.

And without guns.

You're good, Tucker.

I'm lucky, Commander,
he almost killed me.

Did you get the stats
that Hinkle faxed over?

Yeah, sure.

They're right here.

Ben Stillmore.

He used to be the Downy
Corporation's best chemist.

Hasn't worked for a year
and nobody knows why.

The Downy aren't talking.

Neither is Stillmore.

About his employment record?

The employment
records were destroyed

In an accidental fire,
but the important thing

Is that we know that
Stillmore and the training

And the know-how to
make this Hombra.

And with what you found in
that rat-hole we was living in,

This Stillmore should be
put in a nice little lockbox

For at least a couple of years.

Now, you should be
happy about that.

What's the matter?

You're not happy about that?

What about the Hombra?

Why was he making it, and why
did he kill all those women?

Look, Tucker.

You got your man.

The case is close.

Go home, I'll be happy,
Go out and get drunk.

I don't drink.

Then have another donut.

There'll be a commendation
in this for you, anyway.

Oh, a commendation.

Hurray.

What about a raise?

10 o'clock tonight, you're
gonna wear your commendation

On the Sally Winfrey Show.

Who?

The Sally Winfrey Show.

The most popular
talk show in town.

Don't you ever watch television?

Yeah, I watch old movies.

Old movies, why?

Well, 'cause I got
a stomach problem

And I sit up at night drinking
milk and eating donuts and...

Never mind, Tucker.
Never mind.

All right?

Just be at the
studio, 9:00 sharp.

What for?

You're gonna talk
about the gun ban.

And how it doesn't decrease
the ability of the police

To enforce the law.

Wait a minute, Commander.

I am not the man for the job.

Well, that's why the
commissioner picked you.

Because a man with your rep says
it, the public will believe it.

And that's good PR.

Oh, so you want me to lie?

No, Tucker.
Dammit.

I want you to speak
for the department.

Are you sure you
want to do this?

Yes.

And get cleaned up
right, all right?

You're startin' to smell
like my wife's cooking.

I got a slight
plumbing problem.

Fix it, Tucker.

And put your uniform on tonight.

Oh, sir, I don't
have a uniform.

So, see, that's gonna keep
me from doing the show...

That's an order, Tucker.

I always follow orders, sir.

I want to talk to you.
I'm busy.

It's Official, Tucker.

It's about the Stillmore arrest.

If you want to
talk to me, we're

Gonna have to go to your place.

Why?

'Cause I have to take a shower.

You let Stillmore go?

I can't believe it.

Who's side are you on?

It's not a question the sides.

It's a question of legality.

Look, I had probable cause
to enter the premises.

The earring melted, thereby
rending all evidence obtained

In the case inadmissible.

What about my visual
ID of the suspect?

Wasn't confirmed by
computer cross-ref

At the time of the arrest.

Under section 14, that
only gave you the right

To request a search warrant.

My communications were out.

Why don't we plea
special circumstances?

I tried that.

The DA said too many courts have
been overturning convictions

Based on special circumstances.

All we can do is get
him for experimenting

With unapproved chemicals.

They'll wash out the Hombra
and surgically implanted

Government-issued downer.

He'll be sleep-walking
for a year.

Andrea, this guy Stillmore
is a hot-shot chemist.

I mean, he's made a drug that
neutralizes police stingers.

If he can do that, he can make a
drug to neutralize the downers.

Now, he's been killing these
woman and I don't know why.

And nobody seems to care.

But if you let him
go, he's gonna go out

And carve another bullseye.

You can count on it.

Got a towel?

Why did you have to
kill Granger's wife?

He was late on a shipment.

You know it takes time to
manufacture that base chemical

And you have kept
asking for more.

Excuses can be costly.

Granger found that out.

So did Graham.

If you don't stop, I'm
gonna cut off your supply.

Shall I called the
police and tell them

About your little experiments?

Oh, they'll slap
your hand, I know.

But in the corporate world,
the concept of retribution

Is still operant.

You'll be ostracized.

They'll take away your pension.

Your club membership.

A fate worse than death.


Why do you need so much?

You've got enough to satisfy
your addiction for a lifetime.

Since you people
aren't interested

In the commercial
value of my formula,

I'm going into
business for myself.


You bastard.

You know what Hombra
will do to people?

True, it's wonderful.

When will the shipment be ready?

I have orders to fill.

By next week.

I think, by the
day after tomorrow.

I'll pick it up personally.

What if you're being watched?

Oh, I will be.

But it won't matter.

You have a lovely
wife, Germaine.

Good day.

Gotta nail that son
of a bitch to the wall.

And I'm gonna use
the system to do it.

FEMALE (OVER RADIO):
Attention units.

What is that?

FEMALE (OVER RADIO): We
have a 2-11 in progress.

Highland South.

Three males, armed with guns.

This is Tucker, 9-211 I'm
in the area and I'll take it.

Hang on.

[Music playing]

Get down!

Nobody move!

Drop the bag.

I'll be forced to shoot.

April Fool's.

Drop those guns.

Looks like somebody else
wants to play these games, too.

Too bad cops aren't
allowed to carry guns.

That's the rules.

New rules.

Tucker.

So what're you gonna
tell your committee?

Guess I'll tell 'em to
mind their own business.

I think we should get out of
here before the sirens get

Any closer.

MALE (ON TV): Ladies
and gentlemen,

The Sally Winfrey Show.

And here's Sally.

Yes, Commissioner.

It's just about to start.

SALLY (ON TV): Officer Tucker,
do police dart guns protect you

From a criminal using stolen
military or black market

Weapons?
TUCKER (ON TV): Well, I...

SALLY (ON TV): I mean,
doesn't this gun ban

Put the police at an
enormous disadvantage?

TUCKER (ON TV): Well...

SALLY (ON TV): Some
police departments

Throughout the country
are going on strike

Rather than go out
on the street with

Those little plastic stingers.

Is your department
considering such action?

TUCKER (ON TV): No.

SALLY (ON TV): Would you go
out on strike, Officer Tucker?

TUCKER (ON TV): No, ma'am.

SALLY (ON TV): Why not?

TUCKER (ON TV): Well, um...
'cause it wouldn't do any good.

SALLY (ON TV): What would?

TUCKER (ON TV): Giving law
enforcement back their weapons.

Putting guns back in
the hands of the people

That are paid to
protect the city.

Hi, Commander.


SALLY (ON TV): Can we please
go to a commercial now?

[Phone ringing]

COMMISSIONER (ON PHONE): Gauge,
goddammit, I want you to...

Yes, commissioner.

I understand I'm sorry, sir.

The shipment is late.

MALE (OVER PHONE):
I Told you to stop.

I've just begun.

No one can stop me, now.

I can.

If you kill one
more time, I will.

You son of a bitch.

Try it.

And I'll tell everyone
what a killer you are.

Now I want that shipment.

You know that in
its virgin state

The chemical is highly volatile.

You can't rush the process
without risking an explosion.

I've got to have it to mix
it into the final formula

Before I can transport Friday.

MALE (OVER PHONE): If I don't
have what I want by morning,

I'll have to take steps to
ensure your cooperation.

MALE (OVER PHONE): All
right, all right, all right.

I'll... I'll have
half of it ready.

Only half, Germaine?

It's the best I can do.

[Dial tone]

Oh, fuck you... Tucker.

Now Tucker, what do
you wanna do that for?

He'll be all right.

He can just consider
it an extra day off.

So when are you guys
gonna leave me alone?

When we get that gun.

Got a warrant for you.

Come on, Morris.

You're gonna piss my maid off.

Look, Tucker.

Give us the gun, you won't
have to go through all of this.

Tucker.

How can you live like this?

I guess I'm just lucky.

I know that gun's
around here somewhere.

You know, Morris, you just
looked in here last week.

That was last week.

You fuckin' rat.

He doesn't know he's a rat.

He thinks he's a dog.

Freud, come on, Freud.

My baby.

Go on.

Hey, you finished?

Not quite.

Gauge wants to talk to you.

About what?

They found another bullseye.

We got another victim, Tucker.

Similar MO.

She was strangled, that stabbed.

Those are burn marks, not blood.

The suspect just poured
lines of kerosene

And then set them on fire.

Is that our man?

What's the victim's profile?

Monica Cantrell.

Rich.

Divorced.

Hm.

Could be Stillmore.

Did we pick him up?

We can't

Why not?

He's got an alibi.

A witness who says he
never left town that night.

Who?

Us.

What?

Yep.

I put a man on
him night and day.

When he was released.

It's all there.

Where he's been the
last five weeks.

A model citizen.

Boot to the city, got a job
at some electronics firm.

Developing etching compounds for
liquid circuitry or something.

I was about to call
up surveillance

When this happened.

Read the entry on the 16th.

OK.

Subject played music until
10:00, called a coworker

And talked about some technical
problem for over two hours,

And went to bed.

Got up the next morning
and drove himself to work.

When was the time of death?

8:16 PM.

Puzzling.

Copycat killer?

I guess it must be.

Tucker, I'm gonna call off
the surveillance on Stillmore.

Do you think he could
be having an affair?

Thought did cross
my mind, you know?

Well, I went into his
office the other day

And I've never seen
him look so distracted.

Well, when I asked him, he said
the company profits were fine.

No.

He even said that we would
be able to take a little trip

Together real soon.

Yeah.

You know what?

My masseur Georgio is here.

I gotta go.

Hi.

Is Georgio sick again?

Yes

Come on in.

Feels good.


So, um, what's
wrong with Georgio?

He's feeling a little
under the weather.

Your hands feel so good.

Mm.

[Phone ringing]

Hello?


What?


Where?


When?

That's impossible.

I was watching his place
all night last night.


Yes sir, I'm on my way.

And don't forget to lock
up when you leave, now.

FEMALE (OVER RADIO): 49-211.

Looks like we've got
another bullseye at...

Mr. Tremaine?

Where were you last night?

I was at the office.

So late?

There's a lot of work to do.

Do you remember
a former employee

By the name of Glenn Stillmore?

I need another drink.

It's important.

He was a top-notch chemist
for the Downy corporation

And he was fired.

Why?

I don't keep track
of all my employees.

People come and they go.

My wife has just been killed.

I'm not in the mood.

Excuse me.

Elgar.

Hi, Doc.

Elgar.

You look like hell.

Thanks, Elgar.

I hear you've been carrying
a new illegal weapon.

Every load, government issue.

The master.

Oh, I was once when
they let me deal guns.

Can you make some
more of these?

I don't know.

I would have to cobble
some equipment together.

The Feds confiscated all I
had when the anti-gun law went

Into effect.

Oh, it would take some
time and I would be

Duck squat if they caught me.

Elgar.

I'll pay you.

Whatever it takes.

What is money to
an old man like me?

But I could stand a little
adventure in my life.

Thanks, Elgar.

Hey, Tuck.

Where you been hiding this?

Now, you really don't
wanna know, do you?

Well, don't worry.

I, uh... I wrapped it in plastic.

Hinkle?

Hinkle, I need you, buddy.

Music to my soul, Sweetie.

Just shut up and give me
phone traffic on Stillmore.

Oh wait, one sec, my love.

So, you been thinking
about your choice?

What choice?

Meat loaf or spinach quiche.

Oh, I can't get it off my mind.

Got it.

Um, two calls in
the last 45 minutes.

What about a voice match?

Um, audio analysis
confirms it's your man.

Hey, Tucker.

When are you gonna take a break?

You've been on this
guy's wavelength

Since Gauge shut down
authorized surveillance?

And what about you, Hinkle?

You know, every time I
call, you're always there.

Day or night.

I mean don't you ever go to bed?

Is that an invitation?

Good night, Hinkle.

Sleep tight, Sweetie.


FEMALE (OVER MACHINE): Hey
Tucker, this is the land lady.

Your rent is late again.


MALE (OVER MACHINE):
Where's the gun, Tucker?

I might stop over
for dinner tonight

To help you look for it.


ELGAR (OVER MACHINE): Hey, Tuck.

Elgar.

Your keys are ready for pickup.


[Music playing]



Did I come at a bad time?

You see, he's
killed four women.

Two of 'em that we know right
up underneath our noses.

And everybody thought it
was the work of a crazy.

Yeah, he is crazy when
he's on the Hombra.

But I think he
has another reason

For making those killings.

So there's some connection
between these women?

Yeah.

Look.

I still don't see it.

The first victim,
she was remarried.

But her first husband,
his occupation was?

Downy chemical.

Right.

The second victim.

Her husband was the chairman of?

Downy chemical corporation.

And the third...

And the third was Mr.
Tremaine's secretary.

Now, he must've been
having an affair.

And the fourth
was Mrs. Tremaine.

Mm-hmm.

But why go after the women?

Why not kill the board members?

They're the ones that fired him.

Because they're wealthy
and they're powerful.

But they have heavy security.

Now, the women... they're
easily accessible.

Especially the mistress.

And besides, uh... he
loves to kill women.

And he won't stop.

No.

So we have to figure
out how he did it.

Right.

But, Ms. Layton, we might
have to break the law.

Now, how do you feel about that?

Look, the basement.

Well, what do you know?

Bullseye.

What's this?

It's an answering
machine with a timer.

[Music plays]

What's that?

Rite of Spring.

Now all we have to
do is figure out

How to get out of this
place without being seen.

There must be some kind of
trap door around here somewhere.

That's it.

Stillmore's here.

[Door slams]

What are you trying
to do, kill me?

I was about to ask
you the same question.

I wanna talk to my attorney.

You're gonna need an attorney
where you're going to, pal.

You're under arrest.

I want my attorney.

Tucker?

I wanna talk to you.

What am I gonna
charge him with?

Breaking and entering.

He just broke in to
Stillmore's apartment.

So did we.

OK, Mr. Tremaine.

I'm not going to arrest you.

Instead, I'm going to
beat the shit out of.

And why am I going to
beat the shit out of you?

Because I can't sleep at night.

And why not?

Because there's a lot of
innocent women getting killed.

And unless you give me
answers, I'm going to make

Stillmore look like a priest.

OK.

OK, I'll tell you.

But not here, somewhere safe.

Two years ago, Stillmore
came to the, uh, board

With a formula for a new
intelligence booster,

Which he called Hombra.

And we ran our own
tests and eventually

Evidence of side-effects made
it, uh, commercially unviable.

What kind of side-effects?

Delusions of grandeur.

Muscle spasms.

Hyper-activism.

Uh, paranoia.

S... Sometimes death.

It's a powerful addictive.

I think that, uh, Stillmore
had been into his own stock

For some time.

The, uh, Hombra made him,
uh, brilliant but psychotic.

And he threatened
us with exposure

If we didn't, uh,
continue to, uh, make

The basic chemicals so he
could have enough Hombra

For his own addiction.

So... We, uh, supplied him
with enough base chemicals

Just to keep him happy.

But he demanded more and more.

Then we realized he was
selling it on the street

And we refused to...
To give my anymore.

He went into a rage and
he, uh, he started to kill.

Until we supplied him with more.

TUCKER (ON TV): Does
Stillmore look like a priest?

TREMAINE (ON TV): OK, OK, OK.

I... I'll tell you.

But not here, somewhere
where it's safe.

You said Stillmore is
trying to expose you?

I... It's routine for us to
pay poor people to, uh, act

As our Guinea pigs for the... the
final stages of... of testing.

And, in this case
we, uh, skipped

The preliminary lab tests.

And several people, uh,
suffered bad reactions.

And one died.

Did Stillmore know about this?

Yeah.

Uh, we, uh, we tried
to destroy our records.

So that was the fire?

Yeah.

Uh, but he, uh, he
anticipated our actions

And... had made photocopies of
all... all the records and we,

Uh, cooperated just
keep him quiet.

Who was he selling to?

He, uh, flies the
Hombra to Oceanside.

We believe they're
mob-related drug dealers.

They're starting to sell
it all over America.

It could create a
whole new crime wave.

And... And the Hombra it
neutralizes the police tranqs.

If he isn't caught,
there are gonna

Be thousands of criminally
psychotic addicts

And hundreds will die.

He's picking up a huge
shipment today at 10 o'clock,

And if he gets that
shipment to Oceanside,

There's enough to
wipe out a whole city.

One other thing.

The Hombra is
highly combustible.

And its virgin state,
it's even more flammable.

Dance with the devil.


[Music playing]

He knows we're here.

Shoot him!


Tucker!

No!


Oh, God.

I'll radio for help.

This is Tucker.

I need an ambulance
at 223 West Main.

Now!

[Radio chatter]

[Indistinct chatter]

She gonna be OK?

Andrea?

Where is he?

The chemical plant.

Outside the city.

[Music playing]

Freeze!

Stillmore!

You keep it, Tucker.

That's an order.

Yes, sir.

I always follow orders.

Andrea's gonna to be all right.

She's in stable condition.

She's gonna be OK.

And the department's
sent our petition

In, along with all the
other city police petitions.

Congress will have to read them.

Maybe we can all
get our guns back.

By the way, Tucker.

You've got a visitor.

Oh, anybody I know?

Si.

Somebody you know
but you've never met.

Hinkle.

Hinkle?

Aw, Commander, geez,
you gotta help me out.

Listen, this guy
Hinkle's really weird.

He keeps asking me
over for dinner,

He wants to fix me meatloaf.

And I hate meatloaf.

That's too bad.

Meatloaf's my specialty.

Hinkle?

Hi, Sweetie.

Actually I like meatloaf.

It's, uh... It's one
of my favorites.

I just kidding, uh... Uh, Hinkle?

[Music playing]
