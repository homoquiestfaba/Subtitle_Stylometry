So, uh, this is
how you guys want me

to pay you guys back?

Somebody's dying
tonight, Harry.

Who it is is up to you.

Shit.

Fuckin' easier

than coming up
with 100 large,

I'll tell ya that.

Carlo figures
he's killing 2 birds
with one stone.

All right, listen up.

This is
how it's going down:

In that alley,
last door on the left,

knock on it,
ask for big Tony.

They're gonna think
it's a normal drop-off.

When he opens the door
to take the package,

you shank him.

You don't stop
until he's dead.

Tony's still breathing
in the morning,

you won't be.

How will I know it's him?

He's over 300 pounds,
for fuck's sake.

You can't miss him.

Now get going.

Unh. Aah.

Aah!

Unh.




â™ª I fell and found
the silent storm within â™ª

â™ª there's nothing
left of me â™ª

â™ª but skin

â™ª rain

â™ª crying rain

â™ª I bleed
to find my soul again â™ª

Better not be
wastin' my time, Sal.

You wanted
a connection
to the shit.

I found him.

But wait till you
see this guy, Jimmy.

[Russian accent]
Draven is expecting you.

[Rap music blaring]

â™ª Fell in love
with this game â™ª

â™ª money more than the pain

â™ª I was small-time,
but now I'm full-blown â™ª

â™ª fell in love
with this game â™ª

â™ª money more than the pain

what the fuck
is this, Sal?

Trust me, Jimmy.
He's the guy.

â™ª You seek
a motherfuckin' profit â™ª

â™ª about to come up off these
neighborhood fees â™ª

â™ª stupid as it means

â™ª so fuck
the American dream â™ª

â™ª it's all supply and demand
with the clock racin' â™ª

â™ª take some Franklin
and Jacksons â™ª

â™ª and fuck taxes

â™ª with subtext,
false idols â™ª

â™ª and clutch a Bible

â™ª I got to save my neck
and livin' for survival â™ª

â™ª gonna eliminate rivals
in this black mafia life â™ª

â™ª those who
dare and beat you â™ª

â™ª paid
the motherfuckin' price â™ª

â™ª top-rate credentials,
motherfucker â™ª

[Mutes rap music]

Sorry.

Shit makes me
think more clearly.

Which? The weed or
this fuckin' music?

It's a combination thing.

You gonna introduce this
motherfucker, or what?

Draven,
this is Jimmy Pierazzi.

Pierazzi family?

I ain't got no problem

doing business with
the pierazzi family.

First class...

It's the only way
I like to go.

Now that you know about me,

why don't you tell me
a little bit about you.

I'm the pharmaceutical
entrepreneur

that's gonna
get you the cure,
my brother.

E-tabs, amphetamines,

steroids,
you name it.

Hell, even
the black-market
medicine

like the shit you after.

Where do you get it?

From fuckin' Russia, Jimmy.

I want to hear it
from him, Sal.

Jimmy:
Hey, where do you get
the fuckin' medicine?

Like he said,

I get my merchandise

out of a lab
outside of Moscow.

End of the cold war
was a motherfucker

for them Russian boys.

Poor bastards'll get you
anything for a price.

What's your cut?

15%.

Minimum buy,
2 million U.S.

Of course,
my fee's up front.

Hello.

You want to see
my medicine cabinet?

[Turns rap music on]

â™ª My mamacitas,
all my mohiquas â™ª

â™ª ooh, baby girl

oh, shit!

â™ª Thinkin' about
the different things â™ª

â™ª I like to do, see

oh!

Oh, shit!

Ooh!

What?!

This is
my private party stash.

A little
somethin' somethin'
for the ladies,

you know?

They get some before
they give up some.

Hey! Hey! What?!

My mamacitas! SeÃ±orita!

I told you
this guy's large.

Not too fuckin'
smart, though.

What's that, my brother?

What if I came
to whack you right here

and take all your shit?

If I thought
you came over here

to kill a nigga...

[Gun cocks]

I wouldn't have invited
you into my house

in the first place,
my brother.

â™ª Mamacitas, Muy bonitas â™ª

â™ª mohiquas,latinas

â™ª we know
you seen us lookin' â™ª

â™ª let's get
something cookin' â™ª

Nimble motherfucker,
ain't he?

We'll be in touch.

Word?

[Car honks]

Woman: On the night
in question,

were you taking the trash
out into the alley?

And there were 2 men

out in the alley,
am I right?

Now, this man
that you saw with the gun,

do you see him here
in this courtroom today?

[Cell slams shut]

Man: Go, go, go, go!

Get in there! Get in there!

Now!


Director: And cut.

I want everybody
to stay back

until we have
all the fires out.

Assistant director:
Everyone stay back.

Good job, Jimmy.
Your timing was perfect.

Freddy, ok?

Ok.

When do I get to do
the big gags?

Patience, cowboy.

I could've
done that shit easy.

Oh, you getting
cocky on me now?

Listen, you keep
your head on straight

and keep on learnin'.

Hey, when are you
comin' back from New York?

3 days.

Well, hurry, 'cause you
never know, right?

[Bell rings]

I'm gone
for 2 years,

and see what
happens, O'Byrne?

I told you this life
was no good.

Difference is,
I was born into it.

You had a choice.

You holding up?

I'll survive.

Look, I came back
to help out a friend,

a friend
who always had my back.

I asked my uncle Carlo,
as a favor to me,

to make some calls
and get you off.

He's got your judge
in his back pocket.

He's agreed
to throw your case out

before a jury fucks you

out of the next 25 years
of your life.

I don't know when I'll
see you again, Eric,

but I know you'll
go back to the same shit

as soon as you get out.

Me, Iâ€™m
staying in Florida

and living large.

Take it easy.

You got it?

The cure
is in the house.

Let's see.

I could say
the same to you

unless you got
a stack of Benjamins

in your back pocket.

Sal, grab the briefcase.

Now show me my stuff.

You know, I usually
wouldn't meet anyone
like this.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Well, maybe you
shouldn't have.

Draven: Hey, hey, what
the hell is going on?

I just
want to make sure

you don't have
some commie fuck

out there
with a rifle.

Sal, grab the bag

and put it
in the car.

Man, this is some bullshit.

Shut your mouth.

When I find out
this shit's for real,

then you get your money.

Don't you
lose him, Sergei.

Fuckin' knew it.

Hey, where the fuck
you think you're going?

What the fuck
do you mean?

We're in this
together, Jimmy.

No, no, no, no, no.

I ain't with nobody

till I find out
this medicine's
the real thing.

And if it ain't, Sal,

or I find out
you set me up, hide.

Now do me a favor.

Get the fuck
away from the car.

Assistant director:
All right. Quiet, please.

Stand by for rehearsal.

This is 600 pounds.
Air ram is hot.

1, 2, 3.

That's the one.
On the money.

Good, Len.

Lance, let me
talk to you one second.

Lance: What?

Listen, I can get
a lot more distance than that.

Why don't we increase
the pressure?
Whoa, whoa.

The gag is fine,
tough guy, all right?

Don't change a thing
unless you want my job.

Now just remember,

the explosives
and primer cord

right, are wired
to the ram,

so the second
you step on it...

I know. Everything
explodes 2 seconds later.

I got it handled.

Yeah. That's what
I'm afraid of.


All right, well...
Look, seriously,

just...just make it
to that window.

Make sure you make it
to that window

if you got to run
and dive, all right?

I will.
You ok?

Yeah. Yeah.

Airborne.

Assistant director:
The next one is picture.

Assistant director:
This will be picture.

All right. Air ram's set
just like before, ok?

Have a good one,
all right?

All right.

All right, Glen,
you go to the archway.

Artie, go to the window.

You go around
the front door, Billy.

We're ready,

and go hot.

Assistant director:
We are hot.

And roll the cameras.

Assistant director:
All cameras are rolling.

It's yours, Lance.

Action, Jimmy!

Aah! Unh.

Lance, I can't
move my fuckin' legs!

Lance!

Everyone in!

Assistant director:
Abort! Abort!

Aah!

Aah!

Get him out!
Come on!

Get that kid out of there!

Man: Get a paramedic in here!
Lance has been burned!

Assistant director:
Paramedics are on their way.

This man is the cause
of my nephew's death...

My brother's only son.

That's no way

for someone
of my blood to die,

to be burned
like an animal.

And this man will die

and suffer,

suffer the way
Jimmy did.

He doesn't look too good.

He ain't.

Got this
triple-bypass surgery

in a couple days.

Jimmy dying
didn't help, either.

How long Jimmy
been doing movie stunts?

Who knows?

He kept it
to himself.

All right, this is
how it's going down:

You go to Miami

and you
find this guy,

but you don't
whack him yet.

Carlo's got it
in his head

he wants
to be there.

Why?

Feels he owes it
to his brother Joe,

Jimmy's father.

How long before he can
get down there?

Long as it takes.

Vito.

Eric, Sal Canzani.

Nice to meet ya.

Pleasure.

Vito: Sal,
me and Eric are
in a thing here.

We'll talk later on,
all right?

You got it, Vito.

All right, you just
Rose from the dead.

You live in Philly.

There's also
a contact number

for any hardware
you need

when you
get to Miami.

I'm glad
you're out, Eric.

Just lose that
fatal flaw you got.

What's that?

Conscience.

The dead don't talk.
Remember that next time.

I will.

We'll have to talk
some other time, Sal.

I took Carlo home
to get some rest.

Vito, I want to go back down
and find that money for him.

I know I can.

Carlo ordered everyone
to stay out of Miami

until he's ready
to go himself.

Yeah, but I know
I could find it.

Isn't that what he wants?

Carlo doesn't
give a shit

about the money
right now, Sal.

His nephew
was just killed,

and not for nothin',
you're lucky

he ain't holding you
responsible.

It could be you
he wants torched.

I was out of line.

Unh.

Unh.

No, no, no, no, no.
Hold. Cut.

That's a miss,
right?

Um, first thing:
Up there,

when you
set him up there,

he's coming
off the wall.

You're throwing
a short punch.

Actor: Ok.
So if he
comes on you,

set him up again,

and then
send it, ok?

Second actor: Ok.

And then over here,
there's a miss over here,

so, um, take him
off the rail.

Bring him from here to here.

Am I clear here?

All right, and then just
bring it to him straight.

Easy, easy.
Save it for the money.

Let's go,

ok?

Eric:
You all right?

Yeah, yeah.

It's my fault.

I was looking
down at the radio,

and I didn't see ya.

At least it's not that bad.

You do have insurance,
don't you?

Yes, but I'd like
to pay for this myself.

Fine with me.
My insurance is high enough.

Here, take
my driver's license,

and we'll
exchange phone numbers.

I'm Eric.

Clarissa.

You're from
Philadelphia?

Yeah. I just moved here.

Are you working
on that movie?

No. No.

My dad's
the stunt coordinator.

That's my number
at work.

It's where I am
most of the time.

You're
a nice guy, right?

I mean, you're not
gonna stiff me on this?

Here.

Call it a deposit.

No, that's ok. I just...
I have this bad habit

of trusting people
too easily.

That's why
I want you to keep it.

Make people earn your trust.

That way,
you won't get taken.

Thank you.

I'll get an estimate
as soon as I can.

There's no rush.
Take your time.

Ok.

You area nice guy.

I try.

Assistant director:
Abort!

Abort! Abort!

Uh, say, could you spare me
some of that Cha...

So, how's it goin'
down there?

Look, I'm all set.

I found a good way
to stay close to him.

Yeah? So, then
what's the problem?

Let me do what I do best
and get it over with.

No, no, no.

You gotta do it his way.
You know that.

Besides, there's more
goin' on down there

than you know about.

What's that?

Well, let's say
some shit of ours
is missing.

Listen, do yourself
a favor and relax.

Go get laid
or something.

The surgery went good,
but the old man

is still recovering,
so you gotta sit tight.

All right?

Yeah.

I'm gonna be with you
in just a second.

Hello?

Hi. It's Eric.

Hey, how are you?

I'm doin' all right.

How's that totaled car
of yours?

Barely drivable.

Listen, I haven't
had a chance

to get an estimate yet,
and I still have your money.

That's all right.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

I was actually calling

to see if you'd
have dinner with me.

I haven't had
a decent meal
since I got to town,

let alone
some good company.

What do you say?

Why not?

How 'bout Friday night?

Ok.

Where do I pick you up?

Can I wear my seat belt?

Very funny.

Call me on Friday.
I'll give you directions.

I'll speak
to you then.

[Girl coughing]

Oh, Mandy.

I think the medicine
is making me sicker.

It's not the medicine.

You know I'd never
give you anything

that would hurt you.

I just don't want
to feel this way anymore.

I know you don't, sweetie.

Believe me,
I'm trying everything I can

to get you better.

We're gonna beat
this thing.

You get some rest,
all right?

I'll check back
in a little while.

All right.

Something wrong?

I'm sorry.

I don't know.

I'm doing my fellowship
in pediatric oncology

in a children's ward
at the hospital,

and most
of the kids we treat

have terminal cancer
and don't make it.

They taught me not to get
emotionally attached

or involved, but...

Sometimes you just
can't help it.

It gets to you.


I'm sorry to start
the conversation

on such a downer.

Don't be.

I admire
what you do.

It's gotta be hard
to deal with that

every day.

It reminds us how
lucky we all are...

No matter what
situation we're in.

Yeah, it does.

Hey, dad.

Hi, kid.

This is Eric.

Hey. Don't call me dad
just yet.

Uh, Lance'll do
for now.

Dad.

It's nice
to meet you.

Listen, Iâ€™m, uh,

I'm sorry to interrupt
your dinner,

but I got that message
about my prescription.

It's really good to have
a daughter for a doctor.

Or a doctor for a daughter,
whichever makes more sense.

Anyway, look, I'll let
you two enjoy your night

without the old man
hanging over you.

Why don't you stay
and have a drink?

No, I'll just get
out of your way.

When have you ever
refused a drink?

Well, you got me there.
Well, ok, ok.

Scotch and water.

Scotch and water
sounds good.

I'll have a Cabernet.

So, what?

Uh, where'd
you two meet?

We ran into
each other downtown.

I just moved here
from Philadelphia.

You know, I did a...

I did a couple
of pictures in Philly.

That's right. Clarissa
says you're a stunt man.

Yeah.

When are you doing
that pipe ramp?

Um...

That would be Monday.

He's gonna crash
a car on purpose.

I just want to, uh,

show some
of those young punks

that us old boys
can get it done. Cheers.

Stop acting like
you're over the hill.

I only do
because I am.

Hey, you ever been
on a set?

No.

You have, um,
Clarissa bring you.

I'm sure you're gonna
get a kick out of it.

Dad.

Why not?

Yeah. Why not?

So, um, good.

I'll see you then.

Ahh...

Well, thanks
for the dope, kid.

I'll see you.

See you, dad.

I...I hope he didn't
put you on the spot.

No, Iâ€™d...I'd like to see
how a film gets made.

You don't mind, do you?

No, no.
I think you'll like it.

He's gonna do what?


I see him do things
like this all the time.

Kind of crazy,
isn't it?

Just another day
at the office.

Man: They're about ready
on camera, Lance.

So, Sean will be
the first guy in,

all right?

All right.

Yeah...

Well, strap
the old fart in.

Well, you've
always been my hero.

Blow me.


All right.
Airborne, man.

Time to fly
like an eagle.

And land like
a sack of shit.

All right. Lance is all set.

Let's have effects go hot,

and let us know
when cameras are rolling.

Assistant director:
Stand by.

Assistant director:
We are hot.

Let's roll all cameras.

Action, Lance.

[Breaths heavily]

Assistant director:
That's a cut! Safety team in!

Right there!
Right there!

Assistant director:
We have no problems.

Lance is good.
Copy that.

[All cheering]

Whoo!

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah! Yeah!

Whoo!

All right!
Unbelievable.

Whoo!

Check the car,
will you?

I think I left
my ass in there.

[All laughing]

Lance:
Not bad, was it?

Not too shabby.

Hey, Lance,
Lance, Lance.

Yeah.

It's 181 feet.
It's a new world record.

[All cheering]

Good one to quit on.
Good one to quit on.

Hey, you want to go
for a ride?

I'll get it fixed up
in a minute.

No, thanks.

Yeah, me, neither.

Hey, we're through
for the day.

You guys come
to the beach with us.

Let's go.
It'll be fun.

Sure. Why not?

Fine? I gotta get
out of the monkey suit.

Do you mind
if I drop my car off?

Not at all.

Looks like
a nice neighborhood.

Yeah, it's pretty safe.

There's this little old lady
who lives right there.

She's a little obsessive
about watching my place.

What is it?

You don't hear this
in my neighborhood.

What's that?

Silence.

Anything
for a thrill, huh?

He says if he doesn't
scare himself

on a regular basis,
he'll shrivel up and die.

Well, hanging
under a kite

sure seems like
a good way to do it.

[Indistinct chatter]

You like flying,
do you?

Not enough
to try one of these.

Yeah. They get
a little hairy.

Just can't seem to
give it up, though.

It's good
to have her home.

She was, um...

She was out there
in L.A. visiting, uh,

her mother, my ex.

Great, great girl.

Uh...

I, uh, I made a big mess
out of that one,

but that's what a lot of
booze will do for you.

Is that why
you moved here?

Yeah, you know, to get
my head on straight.

I mean, the truth
of the matter is, uh,

a guy can live
almost anywhere nowadays

and make a decent living
in this business.

You must meet
a lot of guys

that say they'd like
to be stunt men.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, we do.

You got your, uh,
your dumb shits.

You know, the idiots
that'll do anything

except use their brains.

Then you got
the vapor lockers...

The would-be heroes
that, uh,

you know, they get
right up to the get-go,

and their heart
shrivels up

to the size
of a mustard seed.

And then every once
in a great while, uh,

in a great while...

You get the guys
in between, you know,

who use their brains
and their balls and...

Well, obviously, they're
the ones we look for.

What if I told I thought
I'd make a good stunt man?

Oh, well, that would just
shock the hell out of me.

I saw your eyes today
when I got out of that car.

It looked like a...

Like a kid's
on Christmas morning.

Anyway, just, uh,
just forget about it.

It's a rough racket, and
you'll do a lot of starving.

I got some money
saved up.

Money. Well,
it takes a...

It takes a lot
of dedication

and a lot of time.

Something I've
got a lot of...

Time.

Hmm...

Well...

Well?

Well?

Will you teach me
how to do stunts?

Oh, see, Iâ€™m, uh...

I'm just really sorry,
Eric. I just, uh...

I just think
my teaching days

are over, you know?

Well, if that's the way
you feel about it.


All right, listen,
you pain in the ass.

I'll tell you,
I'll, uh...

I'll give you
a little taste,

and we'll see how
it goes, all right?

So there I was, assigned
to tail Jimmy pierazzi

for 2 long-ass years,

and I can't even pin
a parking ticket on his ass.

But then,
my prayers are answered.

Now, it's nothing sexy
like murder, extortion,

racketeering.

Hell, the motherfucker's
acting like a savior
for humanity.

But the shit
is still illegal

and my ticket home
to my family,

so I set it up.

I go out on a limb,

a big...

Fucking...

Shaky-ass limb

to set this shit up.

Now it's about to snap
right under my ass, Sal.

Hey, you gotta
give me a break.

I checked on the girl
like you said,

and they already
have someone on her.

This guy sees me,
I'm dead.

See, now,
that's ironic,

because that's exactly
what time it is...

Do or die.

You can't squeeze me.

Heh heh heh ho!

Yes, I can.

I'm a U.S. federal
fucking agent

who's way out of
his jurisdiction, Sal,

and one who's
been ordered

into an internal
investigation in 3 days.

You see, they consider it
highly illegal

to remove $2 million
of seized property

from FBI vaults,

and the shit's
still missing.

Yeah, and so is
the family's money.

Well, you see,
that's not my problem.

You just keep tailing
the girl, partner.

She's our only lead.

I ain't
your fucking partner.

You're the FBI.
You tail her.

Tell you what, partner.

Why don't I give
Carlo pierazzi a call

and tell him you've
been an informant

for the last 3 years.
We'll let him decide.

It's not
my fucking fault

that Jimmy's dead!

Lower your voice.

Fuck you! And fuck
all these people!

I am not taking
the fall for this!

I'm not.

Find my fucking
medicine, Sal.

So, this is where we train
and keep the equipment

Lance rents out
to productions.

Hello, Eric.
You, uh,

you met Graham
here, uh,

runs my equipment
rental business,

does my rigging,
just about everything else.

Uh, ok.

So, now it's...
It's time

for the speech
that I give,

and I'm only gonna
give it once.

All right, um,

if you think

that all this
is about, uh, daredevil,

uh, Evel Knievel crap,
you got it all wrong.

This is about
professionals being serious.

And the idea is not
to ever get hurt.

I mean,
not even a scratch, ok?

So, that means
if I tell you

to jump in the air,
shit your pants

before your feet
hit the ground,

you do exactly
what I say, 'cause...

That's what's
gonna save your ass.

And, uh,
when I rig something,

it stays rigged
the way I rig it.

You understand?

You understand?

Yeah.

Ok. Well,
let's get in on.

All right.

No, hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it. Hold it.

You see,
if the camera's over here?

Look, stand over there.

You can't come short.
You gotta make contact.

Lance: That's better.
Yeah.

Bam! You see? Like...

Bam! Yeah.

Bam! There.

Bam!

[All laughing]

We're hot.

Let's go
for the ride.

The reason your knee buckled
is you didn't commit.

You gotta go for it.

That thing ready
to go again?

It could be.

We're hot.

Graham: There you go.

Yeah.

That's the mind-set
you need.

Jump in the saddle
when you fall off.

That's good.

Oh. Easy.

It was just a slap
on the shoulder.

Yeah.

Come on. Let's go
in the house real quick.

It's not often
I get a chance

to have my daughter
come over and cook.

I bet you probably had
something do with that,

but you know,
I'm just guessing.

[Clarissa laughs]

Get out. You were
captain courageous?

That's right.
The one and the only.

He climbed
the empire state building.

And that is
also very true. Yes, indeed.

How do you do that?

Do what, climb
the empire state building?

How would you do it?
With my hands and feet.

What do you mean?

We used a little cable.

Honey, would you, uh,

would you pour
your daddy just about

another 10 inches about?

What's the closest call
you've ever had?

Definitely
the speedboat.

Oh, yeah. The, uh...

The dreaded speedboat.

Over 900 stitches

and a year
in the hospital.

Why didn't you quit?

The truth is, uh...

You know,
everybody's brave

till that first trip
to the hospital, and...

Well, unfortunately,

sometimes that's
the real test.

Thank you.

Let me get this straight.
This guy's threatened

to tip off the feds that
we're dealing in this shit?

He's got some balls,
I'll tell you that.

He's obviously a wack-job,
or he's bluffing.

Vito, enough.

Jimmy said this Draven
has others on the take.

Who's to say he doesn't
have the FBI also, huh?

We have to be careful.

I'm not sure, Carlo.

And I am sorry
to bother you

at home while
you're resting.

I just wanted you
to know.

You did good,
Salvatore.

You should tell
your family everything.

That's the way
it should be.

Vito.

This Draven must go.

There was this kid, uh...

Jimmy Moore.

You remind me of him.

He, uh...

He was a natural

and had the heart
of a lion.

Anyway, um...

I lost him about
2 or 3 months ago.

He was doing this, uh...

Air ram explosion
through a window.

I don't know what
the hell happened,

but, uh, he never
made it out the window

before the mortars
went off, and, uh...

Well...

Is that how you burned
your leg?

Yeah, well...

Losing Jimmy was about...

About the toughest thing
I ever had to go through.

I mean, don't...

Don't get me wrong.
I mean, I, uh,

I wouldn't give up
what I do for...

For all the tea
in China.

I mean, I had me
some great, great times...

And I lost a couple friends
along the way.

And one of 'em, um...

He used to say,

"we dance
in the shadows of death

every time
we step onto the set."

I guess he was right.

What are you
trying to say?

I'm saying, uh,

it's no disgrace
to walk away.

I understand the risks.

Okey-doke.

Lance:
Let's get that cable up.

He knows what he's doing
with all this stuff, right?

You just do exactly
what he says to do.

You'll be fine.
Lance is the best, man.

Double-checked
the carabiners,
right?

Easy. Double-check
right over there.

Yeah, Graham.

Yeah.

Why don't you, uh,
run downstairs

and double-check
everything's cleared

under the jump
position, all right?

Graham:
All right,
you got it.

And...and...

All right,
let's, uh,

let's go over
what we both know.

I know that the, uh,
the cable's measured

to stop you 3 feet
from the ground,

and all you
have to know...

All you have to know
is headfirst.

If you do,
piece of cake.

So, uh,
you all right?

Yeah.

Airborne, cowboy.
Break your cherry.

Assistant director:
Stand by for picture.

Decelerator's on, Eric.

Assistant director:
We are rolling.

We're ready.

Lance: All right!
3...

2...

1!

Action!


Assistant director:
That's a cut.

Safety team in.

All right, boys,
unhook him.

I'll be right down.

All right,
lower him down.

More.

A little more.

Yeah, there you go.


So what do you
think, huh?

Fucking amazing.


All right, Lance.
We got him.

Wow, it's so different

when my dad's
the one doing it.

Yeah? Why is that?

I don't know.
I've just watched him
do stunts for so long,

he's become
invincible to me,

but with you, I was...

I was really worried.

Come here.

Hey! Hey, hey!

That's my daughter
you pawin'.

Watch it.

Pretty good, huh?

You really have to
go back to work?

Can I see you later?

Yeah.

Ok, I'll call you.

Ok.

Bye.

It's time already?

Yeah.

Thank you, sir.

I found a cure
for your boredom.

I don't recognize him.

That ain't important,

but you two
should get acquainted

as soon as possible.

I thought I was watchin'
the other guy.

Why, you want me
to send somebody else
down there?

No. I'll handle it.

That is what
I like to hear.

[Telephone hangs up]

Nice night
for a drive.

It's clean?

Like a ghost.

What a fuckin' mess.

Hey, make sure you
get that shit back

before anybody
sees ya.

I'll be careful.

You think Sal
went for it?

He better have.

There will be
an investigation

if that medicine
doesn't show up,

and we, my friend...

Will be
shit out of luck.

[Brakes squeal]

God damn!

Fuck!

Fuck!

Sugar...

There was this man

peeking in
the back window there.

I appreciate you
watching out for me,
Mrs. Maxwell,

but I'm sure
it was nothing.

Well, girls nowadays

have gotta be
more careful.

Ok. You have a nice day.

[Operatic Aria playing]

[Woman vocalizing]

Vito: Yeah.

It's done.

Vito: If I'd have known
that he was a fed,

this would have
never come down.

You know that, Eric,
right?

Somebody knew.

Oh, yeah. Somebody...

But listen, don't worry.
You done good.

I checked it out.
The feds found the car.

It was totally clean,
so you know what they got?

They got [speaking Italian]
they got nothin'.

Besides, the guy was dirty,
so they wanna Bury this shit.

When I was a kid
hangin' around
the restaurant,

I told you I wanted
to get made.

Do you remember
what you told me?

Yes, I do, like it was
fuckin' yesterday.

We talked about the "o"

bein' on the wrong side
of your name O'Byrne.

So I'm nothin'
but a write-off.

Hey, you listen to me.

You may not be
a friend of ours,

but you're a friend
of mine, you Mick bastard,

and I promise you
one thing,

and I swear this
on my mother's eyes,

one day very soon,

Sal Canzani's
a fuckin' corpse!

[Telephone hangs up]

So, how was your day?

Good.

I wish I could say
the same.

Why?

I haven't told
anyone this.

Eric, um...

This 13-year-old girl
named Mandy

came into the hospital
about 5 months ago

diagnosed with cancer,

and I got attached.

They finally
decided to move her

into a hospice care unit,

you know, to have
a good death,

to die peacefully.

Well, I just couldn't
write her off,

so I started
doing research.

On what?

Alternative medicines
not yet approved.

I finally found
this one called 714-x.

It's very controversial
and illegal.

Well, I found out
where to get it

on the black market...

And for a while,
she was doing better...

But the cancer was
so widespread initially,

it finally consumed her,

or I didn't give her
enough of the drug in time.

I...I don't know.

The fact is, Eric,

I took this girl's life
into my own hands,

and she died last night,

and I feel like
it's my fault.

It's not your fault.

I know, but it just...

But nothing.

Sometimes you have to
bend the rules in life,

or you gain nothing.

Feel good
about what you did.

You're the best thing

that's ever come
into my life.

I want you to know that.

Aah!

Aah!

Who sent you? Huh?!

Clarissa: Eric!Who sent you?!

Don't, Eric! Stop!

[Man chokes]

Eric: No, Clarissa!

Just let him go!

Just let him go!


All right? All right.

It's ok.

[Brakes squeal away]

All right. All right.

All right.

All right.

It's over.

He must have been
after the money.

What?

He thought
I had the money.

He thought
I had the money.

What money?

Why didn't you tell me
about you and Jimmy?

There wasn't
anything to tell.

He wanted
something serious,

and I didn't.

It wasn't like us.

So what's this money?

Jimmy,
he wouldn't give up,

so he showed me
this briefcase
full of money.

I...I don't know.

It was like he thought
I would do anything with him

after seeing it.

Was anyone else around
when he showed it to you?

No. It was right after
I went down

to buy that medicine
I told you about.

I never felt safe
going alone,

so I asked him
to come with me
this one time.

Someone must think
you know where
the money is.

I don't.

He...he never showed me
the briefcase again.

What should I do?

Nothing.

Oh, Eric, we...We gotta
call the police.

No.

You can't tell
anybody about this.

They'll think you're
directly involved

with how Jimmy
got the money,

and you're staying
with me at my hotel.

I can protect you
there.

I'll take care of you.

I promise.

I'll be right back.

I see you're livin'
the good life.

I figured you'd be
long gone by now.

No, I still got
some unfinished
business here.

See, now that my future
with the Pierazzis
has gone to shit,

I needed to find
that little nest egg

that me and Jimmy
were workin' on.

You seen it?

I didn't think so,

but it's around
somewheres,

and thanks to you
for taking the heat
off of me,

it gives me a little
breathing room

to find
where Jimmy hid it.

They didn't tell you
shit, did they?

That fed
that you hit,

he was doin' a deal
with me and Jimmy,

but Jimmy
decided to fuck him,

and the asshole
left me holdin'
the bag.

I guess
I owe you one.

What do you want?

I want the money,

and you're gonna
help me find it.

It'd be a shame
for Carlo to know

you were hangin'
around that jerk-off

who got
his nephew killed.

I don't think so.
If you want the money,

the last thing you'll do
is tell Carlo anything.

That's why I'm gonna
split it with you 50-50

if you can find it.

What makes
you think I can?

This is Jimmy's
backyard, brother.

It'll be easy.

Come here.


She doesn't know
where the money is,

so you stay
away from her.

The next fuck who comes
anywhere near her,

I'll gut you first.
You understand me?

50-50...

Is not a bad deal.

I thought I saw
a friend of mine.

Was it them?

No.

[TV playing]

You watch much
football, cowboy?

I didn't think so.

You ever think about
how you're gonna die?

How what?

I said, "you ever
think about how
you're gonna die?"

I, uh...As you get older,

you think about how
you donâ€™t wanna die.

What do you mean?

You know, bedridden
in some hospital,

wastin' away.

I'll tell you
what I do know.

I ain't gonna
fizzle out.

I'm gonna
crash and burn.

I guess my thing is
I just don't wanna go out

without having
a family first.

Tired of bein' on my own.

Ah, you ain't
on your own, pal.

Thanks.

Hey, you're not goin'
suicidal on me, are ya?

No.

You got any work
for me this week?

Nah, not really.

Got a really big
air ram gag...

Kind of
like Jimmy's...

But it's about
4 stories up.

Let me do it.

Nah, nah. I gave it
to somebody else.

Come on.

I'm not scared to do
anything you give me,

and you know it.

See, that's what
pisses me off

about you young punks.

You think
you're invincible.

You know, then
you get fearless.

Then you get reckless.
Then you get dead.

Look, I'm just sayin'...

No, I don't care
what you say.

What I'm saying
is you ain't dying
on my set.

All this talk
about dying,

you ain't dying
on my set.

You understand that?

I'm just sayin'
that I trust you,

and I know with you there
takin' care of things,

I can do it.

Yeah.

And by the way,

if you meant
all that shit

about gettin' back
in the saddle,

you need this, too.

Look, just watch
the football, will ya?

Why?

I have to know.

What? What do you
have to know...

That you can
get yourself killed
like Jimmy?

God, you're all alike.

It's your fucking ego.

Thanks for
watchin' out for me.

[Door closes]

Shit.

It's time.

Lance: I told him not to put
that camera so close

to the goddamn boxes.

Eric: Hey.
What?

Ain't I the one that's
supposed to be nervous?

I'm not nervous.

I mean, your ass
is goin' 60 feet,

and I'm pushin' the button,

so, you know,
I'm not nervous.

Right.

Graham...

We're about ready
up here.

How's it goin' down there?

We're good to go.

Lance: Come on.

You...you just concentrate
on gettin' off good

just like you been doin',

you'll clear this alley
real easy,

and leave the rest
to me, right?

Close your eyes.

You know,
this here one will, uh,

separate the men
from the boys.

Well, that's why I know
you're gonna kick ass, son.

Thanks.

Assistant director:
We're all set, Lance.

It's your call.

Let's go.

Time to get airborne,
buddy.

Let's do it.

Roll cameras.

Let's do it. Let's do it.

Come on.

And all cameras
are rolling.

Let's do it, Eric.

Assistant director:
And cut.

Hey, are you ok,
Eric?

Yeah. Just let me
catch my breath.

Here.

Sometimes
these boxes

aren't that
forgiving, are they?

You can say that again.

[Graham laughs]

You were definitely
airborne, brother.


Man, I'm just glad
you listened
to Lance.

What do you mean?

Jimmy didn't.

When we found
the air ram,

the Gauge was smashed,

and the needle was stuck
higher than we set it.

Jimmy doubled
the pressure

without telling anyone.

If he would have
just listened to Lance
and not changed a thing,

he'd still be alive.

But you did it right.

[Crew whoops, cheers]

[Knock on door]

Great shot, hotshot.
You got 'em all talking.

Let's celebrate.

First tell me why
you covered for Jimmy.

What are you talking about?

You know
what I'm talking about.

Why didn't you tell me?

I, uh, I really didn't
have any reason to.

I mean, I guess
I should have,

but I was asking you
to trust me.

I really didn't want
to tarnish the kid's name.

He was a...He was
a real good stunt man,

but he didn't listen
sometimes, you know?

So, he increased
the pressure?

Yeah.

See, I knew he had family
in New York,

and if the insurance
investigators found out

that he was tampering
with that ram, well,

they would have
found him at fault

and not given him
any benefits.

You took the blame.

I got nothin'
to prove anymore.

What the hell
did it matter?

Enough of this shit.
Listen.

You go home
and get yourself
some sleep.

We'll celebrate tomorrow.

You got that right.

Great jump.All right, man.

Fuck.

[Weather report on TV]

[Car door shuts]

It went good.

It went good.

Asshole.

Hi, sugar.

Hello, Mrs. Maxwell.

Is that her?

That's her.

Hey...

Open the damn door
for the lady.

You boys today
have got to learn
some manners.

You're absolutely right.

At least Clarissa's
old boyfriend
was a gentleman.

You got busted,
didn't you?

Hell, he'd even crawl
underneath the house

to fix her plumbing.

Now, that's what I call
a real man.

Clarissa:
You're kiddin' me.

Well, that's
the briefcase.

Oh, my god.

That's the cancer medicine
I was telling you about.

Jimmy must have thought
he could sell it.

Come on. We're
taking this with us.

What's wrong?

Come in.

Now that everybody's here,

we can get down
to a little business.

You put my daughter
in the middle of this shit?

Dad, stop!Damn it, Eric.

Now we're havin'
a little fun.

Inside!

Get the fuck inside!

Sal: You're
in the chair,
girlfriend.

No gun, huh?

Gettin' sloppy, Eric.

I should do him
right now.

Make things right
with Carlo, wouldn't it?

You don't know, do you?
Heh heh.

I love this.

See, your boy came down here
to put a bullet in your head

for gettin' Jimmy killed.

It shoulda been easy
for a killer like Eric.

Right, Eric?

I guess you turned into
a little bitch, didn't you?

Enough!

The money's in the car.

See, now we're
gettin' somewheres.

So, why don't you go outside
and get my fuckin' money?!

Now!

Ok. Just, please
don't hurt him.

One big, happy family, huh?

Fuck it.
I got nothin' to lose.

I'm sorry.


Ain't like you
to take a bullet,
Eric.

So, I see
your new girlfriend

and all our money
and a big bag,

and it looks like they're
takin' a trip someplace.

And then I see Sal.

I'm gonna dig a hole
for that prick.

How long you been
following me?

Long enough.

Carlo here?

Among others.

I'm the only one
that knows.

Your conscience
has fucked you again.

You know that, don't you?

I finally feel
like somebody,

like I fit in.

This is my family now.

This?

This is what you want?

For this man to live,
you know what has to happen?

Prepared to do this?

Yes.

Done. I'll arrange a place.

Why so easy?

Let's just say
you'd be doing me a favor.

If anything happens
to me,

you'll tell 'em
and protect 'em, right?

You don't make it easy,
do you?

I'll just be a minute.

What else
didn't you tell us?

Look, I don't have
any excuses.

It's just...

This is the only life
I've ever known.

Why didn't you
just kill me, Eric?

You ever want to belong?

Be a part of something,
like a family?

That's all I wanted.

Well...

I finally found that
with you...

And Clarissa.

Well, how does it feel
to finally have that

and then just
throw it all away?

I understand
if you guys

don't want
to have anything
to do with me,

but I have to take care
of this situation.

That way, nothin' will
happen to either of you.

Stay here
till it's over.

Vito will
look out for you.

What the fuck
are you doing here?!

I told you to stay
at the house.

Well, if you really
don't want this way
of life anymore,

I'm here
to help you do that.

No. It's not that easy.

You don't just
walk away clean
from these guys.

There's a price to pay.

Well,
that's fine, Eric,

but you've got to
give a little more
thought to this.

Look, there's gotta
be another way.

Let's call the cops.
You haven't
committed a crime.

I'm sure as hell
not gonna say
nothin'.

It's not an option
I can take.

Family deals with family,

even if it's
the one that you're
walkin' away from.

Shit.
What?

It's too late, anyway.

Listen to me.
This isn't make-believe.

This isn't some movie set.

All right.
So, what do we do?

Hide by the bay door.
When the car comes in,

pull the door shut
and then disappear.

I'll take care of the rest.I'm not fuckin' hidin'.

Listen! Do as I say,

and we'll both make it
out of here, all right?

Yeah, all right.

Vito said they had him.
Where are they?

This is the place
he said to meet, Carlo.

[Door closes noisily]

Hey, find out
who's over there.

Look out!

You find him.

You ram
that fuckin' bay door

and you get Carlo
outta here!

We'll take care
of this prick.

Aah!

Come here!

Thanks.

Likewise.


What do we do?

Commit.

Hey, don't ever
do that shit again.

I don't plan to.

Go home.
I'll meet you there.

No. You come with me.

No. I gotta finish this.

I gotta finish it alone.

Go.

It'll be all right.

This is the last thing
I have to do

before I can
leave all this behind.

Get out!

Get out of the car,
Carlo.

Look, Carlo,

I appreciate everything
you've ever done for me,

and Jimmy was
my friend...

But it was an accident.
He killed himself.

So get out of here
before it's too late.

Who do you think you are?!

Don't talk to me
like I'm some jerk-off.

You show me the respect
I deserve

and pull that trigger,

or walk away like a...
Like a coward.


Not long ago,
you wouldn't
have hesitated.

I'm through
with this life.

Then enjoy your new one.

You fuckin' Mick bastard.

All you had to do
was pull the trigger.

Well, like I always
told you...

The dead don't talk.

[Woman vocalizing]

[Knock on door]

Eric didn't make it.

What are you
talkin' about?
I just left him.

He's dead.

He gave his life
for the two of youse.

Make it worthwhile.


[Woman vocalizing]

Why don't you put that
in the back, dad?

I put some drinks
in there.

All right.

Can't believe
I talked you into
this road trip.

Gonna be all right.

You know,
it ain't every day

that an old fart
like me gets

to enjoy his daughter
and the open road.

And you know
I ain't seen your mom
in a long time, and...

This will be good,
to see her.

Hey...

How do I look?

You look great, dad.

Well, all right.

Be nice
to get together again.

Yeah, it will.

I think that's
what Eric meant
about having family.

Be nice to take the time
to enjoy it.

Well, that's somethin'
we got a lot of, kid. Time.

â™ª and love

â™ª has made me
reclaim myself â™ª

â™ª my rush

â™ª is greater than
the greatest rush â™ª

â™ª catch me,
I'm fallin', fallin' â™ª

â™ª I'm fallin'
so in love with you â™ª
