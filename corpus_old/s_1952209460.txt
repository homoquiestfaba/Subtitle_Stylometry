FARMINGTON MENTAL HOSPITAL

FIVE HOURS LATER

THE STEAM EXPERIMENT

You fucking bitch!
You're gonna die!

This is a nice hotel.

Yeah.

Built in the 1900s by a
railroad tycoon for his wife.

She was a socialite, had
a lot of friends liked to entertain.

Isn't that a fact?

Yeah... And she died
after World War II,

...and it was closed for many years,
then a corporation bought it.

Now it's being turned into luxury condos.

Luxury condos.

So that's why it's empty, hah?

Yeah.

I'll tell you the truth Grant,
we are the last guests.

I bribed a management.
They're gonna start renovation on monday.

I gotta tell you I'm impressed.

This is a class-ass act.

Nothing but the best,
for the Annabell Dating Service.

What's up man?

My name is James Pettis.
I'm here to see Walter Grubbs.

Walter Grubbs... Let's see.

That's the editor in chief man.

The editor in chief.

Call him.

What, now?

Now.

Well done you.

Grubbs?
Sim.

Walter.

Mr. Grubbs,

...your clock is five minutes fast.

What can I do for you Mr.?

Pettis, James Pettis. You can
help me save the world.

Ok, look pal, in two hours
I have a deadline, so...

Listen, I chose you Walter, because you are a man of integrity.

I could have gone to the New York Times,
I could have gone to the Washington Post...

...but I chose, you.

Can I make a suggestion?
Sure.

Can I make a suggestion here?

You wanna save the world?
Great. Write a letter.

Make it as juicy as you want,
and send it to my attention, ok?

I'll see if I can get you in a column or
in "Letters to the Editor" section on Saturday.

Remember? The pen is
mightier than the sword, ok?

Ok. And... Walter, I have
got a deadline too.

And in about two hours,
people are going to die.

Hey, Jack.

What's going on Bobo?

Who is the lucky go tonight?

Show me a little respect.
You know I got ties older than you?

Oh, really?
Yeah.

Ties older than me?

I guess I'll have to call my grandmother.
Maybe she is up for a date.

If your grandmother still looks like you,
she wouldn't want you to do that.

Think it's easy to be me,
isn't it?

What do you think of that, Walter?

Well now, that is quite a story.

All right.

I'm gonna call the press room,
I'm gonna tell them to hold the presses.

You think you can make the deadline?

Oh yeah, story like this, absolutely.

Thank god you didn't call The Times.

Butchers...

That's putting it kindly.

I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
You want a cup of coffee?

You look tired, let me
get you a cup of coffee.

How do you take it?
Cream, sugar?

Surprise me.

Ok.

Yeah, Mancini.

Hey, Walter.

What are you talking about?

Walter.
Jack.

Thanks for coming.

How's that little thing?

Listen, I wanna introduce to
Jimmy... Pettis.

Hey, Jimmy. Jack Mancini, Grand Rapids
Police Department. How are you?

Walter.

Relax about that.

I know Walter for years.

Walter.

Besides, it's my night off.

He seemed mesmerized
here by your story, ha?

Hey, that's something.

It's only you, you work at the
Grand Hotel, ha?

How long have you
been employed there?

You still work there?

What do you do for it now?

Me?

I'm the head of General Motors.

So, what's all this
about the steam room?

Nothing. Apparently, Walter.

Just that, six people are locked in one,
and in about two hours they're gonna die.

Let me get this straight.

You've got six people locked
right now in a steam room?

Ever sit in 130 degrees, detective?

Do you know what happens
to the body in about two hours?

The lungs melt.
The eyes cauterize.

If you want to play Trivial Pursuit,

...it's on your head, Walter.

All right, Pettis.

Call me Jimmy.

Oh, Jimmy.

Listen,

...let's take this slow, ok?

Walter and I are just a
couple of pedestrians here.

You know, we are not...
we are not men of great intellect...

...like you,

...and, just tell us.

Why are you here?

According to the long count
of the Mayan calender,

...history is going to end in 2012, not
because of spiritual enlightenment,

Hundreds of millions of people
are going to die, that's fact.

Hundreds of millions of
people will to die, how?

Global warming.

130 degrees
in the middle of December.

That's a fact. Three years.

The midwest will be under water,

...swallowed by the great lakes.

Years of corn will be sold
by the highest bidder.

Chaos, anarchy, the de-evolution
of society as we know it.

All for one and not a soul for all.

De-evolution, chaos, anarchy. Gonna make
New Orleans look like a candy store.

Let me get this straight. You've got 6 people
locked right now in a steam room,

...because you think
the world is gonna end in 2012?

My calculations are quite precise.

Global warming?
Global warming.

Jimmy, the affects of global warming
are projected to occur for another...

50 years? That's a lie.
In fact, detective,

...the affects of global warming...

...can be seen right now,
because they're being filmed.

You are filming what?

Who?

Hold on a second,
let's back up.

Jimmy, I'm gonna give
you what you want.

All right? You want the front page?
I'm gonna give it to you, ok?

Above the fold, Walter,
above the fold.

Right. Absolutely.

So, we have an agreement?

You got your headline.
Now, here is what I want:

I want the names of the hostages,
right now.

I wanna know where they are.

I'm not naive, detective. I wanna
see my headline, in big bold print.

Then I'll tell you where they are.

Proof.

So Jesus sent the Virgin Mary who
decided to join the party, hah?

Frank, how're you doing?

Christopher.
Christopher?

Good to meet you, brother.

Grant.
I'm Christopher.

Hey, how you doing man?
Great, good to meet you, Frank.

It's hot in here, ha?

Oh, Pettis told me that you're,
drafted by the cowboys?

In 1982.

Somebody must have turned up the steam,
temperature just went up above a 100 degrees.

Hi, I'm Catherine.

I'm Grant, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

I'm Margaret.
It's a pleasure, Margaret.

It's hot.

I'm Christopher.
Hi.

Here we go, here we go.

Come on.

Frank, Frank.

I have a suggestion. Why don't we all say a few
words about ourselves and get acquainted?

It's a wonderful idea. But, let's do it fast.
Just a couple of sentences, nothing more.

James Pettis, if you're watching this.

I love you man,
you are a fucking genius.

I'm an actress,

...a former actress,

...it didn't all work out the way I'd hoped.

I'm from New York, as in Manhattan.

Like...
I like that's dengerous,

I like falling in love.

That'd be dangerous.

Dislike?

When it's over.

Ok, my turn.

Ex football player,

I run a charter boat
outside Detroit,

I'm from Dallas Fort Worth originally.

Likes...

Viagra.

Dislikes, the fact that I need viagra.

Just keeping it real, Frank.

I own an Italian
restaurant in Brooklyn.

Is it yours, you're
in the management, or?

That's funny.
Yeah, you're funny.

Listen, anybody comes
to New York, I hook you up.

I got the best Italian
food in all five burrows.

I'm from Brooklyn.
Born in ... you know.

I like...

...chicks that know what they want.

When they want it,
where they want it.

And then not afraid to tell you
right to your face, you know?

Dislikes?

Nothing, I love everybody you know
what I mean, forget about it.

I work for a small
publisher in Connecticut.

I can listen you talk all day.

I'm from San Francisco, California.

Like...

I like living the life of a neurotic.

Struggling.

Bored at times.

Introspective, sensitive.

You're a typically fucked up
American romance writer,

...who fancies herself a poet.

Dislike...

Therapy twice a week.

I'm a nurse. I'm from
Scranton, Pensilvania.

I'm sorry, I don't want to
ruin everybody's weekend.

My wife.

My wife died in a car
accident nine months ago.

I'm sorry.

I didn't think it was a
good idea to come.

And then I told to myself:
"Why not"?

Waitress, born in Atlanta,
live in Detroit.

Likes...

Money, and lots of it.

Dislike...

It's worth that hate,

...who really fucking hates.

And a guy thinks who can grab your ass
just because he left you a 3 dollar tip.

I fucking hate that.

All right.

Now that we're done with whole
getting to know together bullshit,

...I think I'm gonna enjoy a little steam.

Nice.

They're real?

Yeah, they're real. And that's
as close as you'll ever fucking get.

Nothing on Pettis,
what about Gregory?

Raymond Gregory.

Do me a favor, run a
search on steam baths.

Steam rooms, yeah.

Good.

Ok, Raymond Gregory. Professor
Curtis University, late 80s.

He's got degrees of the Ying-Yang.

I found a review online
of one of his books,

...both of which are out of print,
by the way.

Gregory pseudo scientific mambo jambo
borders on the delusional.

Review goes on to say, it's
laughably ludicruous and long-winded.

Curtis canned him shortly thereafter.

There's no pictures on this one?

Nothing.

I found this on his file.

At least he's seeing a shrink.

Which I could afford to see.

No surprises there.

Do you think that
perhaps he is Gregory?

Jack, I don't know
what to think of this guy.

Maybe he thinks he is Gregory.

He was a thinking man.

Good night.

So, what were you doing in Grand?

Worked security.

I worked security,
back in the day.

New York, until I joined the law enforcement.

Boring good dough, heh?

Pays the bills, got time to study.

I bet you do a lot of reading.

Heard about the guy called Gregory?
He is a smart guy?

Raymond Gregory is a genius.

What do you think happened to him?

Government ruined him.

Noone took his work seriously.

Light years ahead of this time,
light years.

No, you're not wasting my time.
But 6 people are locked in a steam room.

And they are all going to die.

I'm gonna ask you about them later.

Walter said you started some
kind of an online dating service.

Take them to the Grand at least?
Had a few laughs, did you?

That's bold.

Bold? It's brilliant.

Web site? A bunch of said and lonely
people are gonna find something, love?

In the dream. Hope.
What's more beautiful on earth?

I'm pulling the new
age bullshit, right?

You get them all pumped up,
everybody lucky, right?

They get laid.

I gotta hand it to you, Jimmy.

You're a smart guy.

It's so easy.
The very nature of sheep.

The sheep got any names?

No. But I can tell you what's
happening to them right now.

All right.

That does it for me.

Fucking door is stuck.

I'll get it.

Oh god, it's hot.

This is freaking me out.

The fucking wood must swelled up.

It's not the wood.

Then what the fuck is it?

James. James.

Frank, you're gonna hurtl yourself, man.
We can't do a goddamn thing, stop it.

Open the fucking door.

The lungs melt.

The eyes cauterize.

Pettis. Open the fucking door.

Frank.
Frank, you're gonna hurt yourself.

So what are we
supposed to do then?

Just stay cool, and hope
they come and get us?

I'm fucking clostrophobic man.

I need some fucking air.

Some air, ok?
I need some fucking fresh air.

You stop that bullshit right now,
you hear me?

James. Pettis.

Frank, you moron.

What did you fucking call me?
You fucking cunt?

No, no, no, come
on buddy, come here.

Fucking call me?

No, no buddy, come here.

Stop it, everybody.

Everybody please,
just calm down, ok?

We are supposed to have a
massage in like 20 minutes, right?

Cathy has got a point dude,

...the dinner is next
on schedule, right, right?

They are gonna
come get us for dinner.

Yeah.

What if noone comes down?

Then what?

Come on in.

How you doing, Sam?

How long have you known this guy?

6 months.

Jimmy worked the weekend shift.

Then he just disappeared one day.
Stopped showing up for work.

Shit!

This hotel has got
some kind of steam bath?

Was one in the basement.

Which one of you cunts was
the last to touch that fucking door?

It was me.
I was the last one in the door.

I didn't mean to do
anything though, Frank.

Frank.

Chill out. They are gonna come down
and get us for dinner. It's gonna be ok.

Sorry.

Yeah. They'll come and get us.

They're gonna come down, right?
It's gonna be cool.

Right?
Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

Don't you freak out on us
buddy, come on, sit down.

Sit down right here with me.

So, there is nothing
to worry about?

We are only trapped
in a fucking steam room.

Will you shut the fuck up.
I told you I'm clostrophobic, ok?

I don't give a shit
what you are.

Fucking bitch.

I'm a bitch?
Am I bitch?

Look at you.
You're a fucking pussy.

I'm a bitch?

Jessie, stop. We're not trapped,
all right Frank?

Funny how everything was cool
until you bitches came in.

Go fuck yourself!

Jessie, stop!

I think that's enough, dude.

Back the fuck up, bro.

What, Frank?
I'm warning you, buddy.

What the fuck are you
gonna do buddy?
Frank.

You're gonna fucking
stop me, motherfucker?

Motherfucker!

We're freaked out here, ok?
Stop.

You fucking bitch.
You're fucking disgusting.

You actually like this guy?
He's a fucking looser.

I think you're full of shit.
Fucking pussies like you don't play football.

Frank.
You don't have to do this, Frank.

Just keep it togethert,
pull it together Frank.

Pull it together,
everybody, everybody.

Everybody.

Fuck you all.

Pettis!

Was? What do you mean was?

They destroyed it 3 months ago.

They're building some kind of underground
parking ramp down there something.

The hotel is under renovation.

Ain't nothing left.
They're turning it into condos.

I never said it was the Grand.

I'm sorry to bother you.

See you.

Frank.

Please stop, please!

Frank, what are you doing?

Shut up!

Getting in a trap, Frank.

Frank, stop.

You're dead.

Come here.

Get off off me!

Frank, stop it! No!

Fucking bitch, you fucking bitch!
You're gonna die!

One down, detective.

Yeah, this is a message for
Dr. Alexander Adams.

It's detective Jack Mancini,
Grand Rapids Police Department.

I'm holding one of your patient sir,
Mr. James Pettis.

You call me back as soon as possible, sir? I'm at
555-0221. All right, as soon as you can sir, thank you.

Hope you send it
to my wallet, detective.

So you tell your shrink?
About your experiment?

Why don't you call and ask him?
Oh, wait. You already did.

It's funny how most perhaps tell
their mother before they first up to a crime.

Here you're walking
in a newspaper office,

...yacking you're
holding 6 people hostage.

So let's say you get your headline,
you know what you're looking at?

Six people hostage in a steam room?

They'll lock you up, pal.

No way to key.

It's not about me, detective.

I know, I know. It's all about
the global warming in fact. Saving the world.

Yeah, Mancini. Hey, how hot you're still
waiting for? I'm gonna be there in an hour.

God help me.

You underestimate the situation, detective.
Why, what's your smile about?

Biggest case in your life, you wanna
meet a girl in a bar in an hour.

I don't underestimate the situation whatsoever.
Pathetic.

Listen man, you're holding
6 people hostage,

...you're going to jail,
for the rest of your life.

If not, they'll get you a luny thing.

Me? Yeah, I got my late night rendezvous here.
Biggest blue eyes you ever saw.

Who is pathetic now, champ?

Who is pathetic now?

What do you got?

Says, he locked 6 people
in a steam room.

Because of global warming.

Says, the end of the world is coming.

That's what we need. Another
nutjob walking in the streets.

At least he is original.

I put a call into the shrink.

Something about the way he
describes the hostages, it's too precise.

There's too many details.

Jack. This guy looks
like a nut case.

I'll give you 30 minutes with him,
get what you can and we cut him loose.

I got a burglary down out Fletcher,
I need you out there.

It's my night off.

Yeah, well you're here now.

Hey, Jack. I called every hotel in
Grand Rapids with a steam room. No hostages.

There's no health clubs?
All closed.

Closed?

Call the security companies down.
Check every one alarm.

Call every internet dating
service in Michigan.

Lonely, Sir?

Yeah. Cross reference it
with his name, Pettis.

James Pettis.

James Pe... Is that two t's?

Two t's. Make it snappy.

Only speed I know.

Where have you been in the last 3 months?

European vacation.
Have you ever been to Italy, detective?

Of course you have. Weather
is lovely this time of year.

Now you listen to me, asshole.

You're wasting my fucking time now.

You're gonna give me
the full names of the hostages,

...or I'm gonna rip them
out of your fucking head.

One by fucking one.

Is that how they
do it in New York?

Intimidate?

To get a confession?

You're pathetic, detective.

You could've been retired by now,
so you do this for fun?

What else you do?

Chasing middle-age fluzies
around crap-ass bars?

Blinding them with vodka, and lies,
telling them how good they look for over 50?

Oh, detective.

No. No. I see right
through you, detective.

You do not have the intellectual
capacity for this case.

You should go.

Let's talk about you.

Who do fuck are you?

Jimmy Pettis, yeah?

What kind of life are you trying to keep your wit on?
Your vulgarity is pathetic.

My vulgarity?
It annoys me.

The pinky ring, and cheap cologne.
And cheap sip.

What did you say about my suit?

You wanna play bad cop, hah?

What did you say about my suit?
Ok, ok.

Let's play bad cop. Ok.

Ok, let's play bad cop.

You go get Walter,
before somebody else dies.

Catherine?

Catherine?

I want to go.
Get me out of here.

We're trapped.
We're trapped.

Somebody has locked us in here.

What now?

It is that sick fuck
locked us in on purpose.

Give me break. An online dating
service gives away 5000 dollars.

We're trapped.

It was weird from the get go.
Come on!

Pettis knew what he was doing.

I don't have anyone.

I don't have anyone
who's gonna look for me.

Do you?

What about you, Catherine?
Is anyone coming for you?

No, Jessie.
Nobody is coming for me either.

Grant!
Grant!

Grant, I'm talking to you.

Grant!
Grant!

You.

Noone is going to be looking for me.

My whole life, not even my parents.

But if I focus on that, I will lose my mind.
So, what I'm gonna focus on

is getting us out of here.
So you shot your mouth.

Your big mouth
has caused us a big problem.

You onyl open you mouth to breathe,
do you understand?

Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

Now. There is a logical
explanation for everything.

Only thing that's going wrong,
is the door got jammed.

All right, nobody locked us in here,
the door jammed people, right?

Right, Christopher?

And that son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch lost his mind.

That's all what's going wrong, right?

Grant?

What, Catherine?

There's a crack in the window.

Christopher.

Help us, help us.

Christopher, do something.

Help.

Help us.

Pettis!

Please.

Ok, one of you girls, get your head out
to see what's blocking the door.

I'll do it.
Good girl.

Ok, you lie down to your face first,
I'll lift you up, ok?

Ready?

Don't drop me.
Don't drop me!

Make sure you got her.

I got her.

Here we go.
Is she ok?

Let me up, let me up.

Watch the glass.
Ok.

I don't see anything,
nothing is blocking the door.

There must be something.

There's nothing blocking the door.

I see the pipe.
Pettis!

Jessie, what happened?
Pettis!

We got her.
Pettis!

The lights went out,
I can't see anything.

What do you mean the lights went out?

The lights. I can't see!
I can't see!

Help!

Someone's here. Help us.
Está aqui alguém! Ajude-nos.

Someone is coming.
Jessie, what's happening?

Help us, we're locked in the steam room.

Help. Thank you, thank you.

What happened?

Do you have her?
Yes, yes. I got her.

Don't twist her. Don't twist her.
It's ok, Jessie. It's ok.

We got you.
We got you.

Roll her over here, don't twist her.

Oh, my god!
What is that!

My god.

My god.

Dating services with internet
addresses in Michigan.

Nothing with the name Pettis.

You check the ones
giving away cash prizes?

Free weekends at these hotels.

All of them have give aways, detective.
That's how they get people to sign up and pay.

The only Turkish bath I found
was at the Grand Hotel.

But here is something. I can't find anything
on James Pettis in the state of Michigan.

No driver's licence. His social
security doesn't match.

What do you mean it doesn't match?

His W-4 at the hotel.
Pettis used a fake number.

I take it back. It's a real number, it just
belongs to someone in Florida who died 30 years ago.

Tell Clarck I'm gonna book him
on the suspicion of homicide.

I'll run his prints.

Let's go back to where we left off.

Jessie dies.

Were you having trouble to follow the story, detective?
Tem algum problema
em seguir a história?

No, I follow the story. One thing I can't see here
though. Jessie is killed by a guy with a nail gun, right?

Ok, so who killed her then?

You?

Because Jessie was supposed to
have died by a natural human reaction.

A reaction that is
global warming, right?

So that doesn't add up.

Which show that your plan Jimmy,
enough itself is fucked up.

You know, the mother of all experiments,
it's not airtight. It's not tight.

All this shit about "I gotta talk to Walter,
I wanna be on the front page now,

"...I wanna set everyone free." is all shit,
cause it's not happening now.

Never was happening now. And if it was
happening now, how the fuck did you know?

How the fuck did you now Jessie got
hit with a fucking nail gun, Jimmy? How?

I don't know.

You don't know? I'm fucking all over you.
You lock 6 people in a steam room?

Yeah, before the construction
began at the Grand Hotel.

And they are dead in there,
for months Jimmy. They're dead.

Now look at me
when I'm talking to you.

Where are the bodies?

Where are the bodies?

Fuck it.

Is there a possibility here,
none of this ever happened?

You're not even Jimmy Pettis.

You're just a whacko.

Who are you?

Are you Raymond Gregory?

You're a delusional,
you understand that?

Jimmy, all this convoluted, concocted theory
about global warming, man. Give it a rest.

It's over.

It's over. Your life's work has been
pissed upon man, it's been trashed.

Your existence, it was
rendered, a fucking lie.

A lie.

You kill six people?

You don't qualify.

You do it in your imagination.

Either I killed them months ago
detective, or I'm insane and...

...I made it all up,
make up your mind.

I mean when I said earlier that you're
not qualified to handle this case,

I made a mistake,
that was a gross understatement.

It pisses me to see you all excited
to find out who may have killed Jessie.

And maybe I have an
accomplice, maybe I don't.

It pisses me even more that
you can't keep your pee-head on...

...the bigger picture, there
is a bigger picture here.

I mean I'm only continuing with the
experiment to prove what happens to people...

...during the chaos,
because of the heat.

The lives of these
hostages are of no value.

You have a job,
that is your bigger picture...

To get Walter to put
my story in the paper.

And, I'll level with you, this..

You've gotta do
better than this...

...fake social security.

Oh, you're gonna level with me?
Then I'm gonna level with you.

I'm gonna tell you exactly
what I told you in Walter's office.

You give me the full names and
locations of these hostages, ok?

Then you get your 15 minutes of fame.

You don't give me the proof.
You don't get your headline.

I really don't give a fuck.

I really don't.

About global warming.

Greenhouse gas.

Jack, I gotta talk to you.

A psychiatrist called,
and he sent this over.

In the last 6 months
professor Raymond Gregory...

...has confessed to his psychiatrist
every major assassination in the US.

He played you, Jack.

He escaped from the mental
ward of state hospital.

So he is professor Raymond Gregory.

I surmised that.

Well, they're sending
somebody to pick him up.

So what does it proove? It prooves
he is a nutcase. It's all it prooves.

He still could be holding people
hostage, he still could've killed them.

He's too precise, I told you that. He knows
every detail about how these people died.

Jack!

Fucking guy is a frootloop.

So, what if he's a frootloop. Give
me the 30 minutes, I'll crack him.

Jack, I've talked to his psychiatrist,
he's schizophrenic and he's highly delusional.

You understand that?
You've got it? It's over.

Now, get your ass over
to Fletcher street.

Your shrink called.
Sent the paperwork.

Says you confessed already,
about killing JFK.

You killed John Lennon?

Did you try to shoot
the Pope in Rome, Jimmy?

This case is closed. I gotta go.

Just back to the luny pin pal.

Call me crazy if it
makes you feel better.

I'm always gonna miss you.
You have a nice life.

I'll tell you where the bodies are.

What is happening?

Oh, God!

Margaret was...
she was unstable anyway.

But you see detective, millions of
people will follow that direction.

That's why
the experiment is so valuable.

Many many will kill themselves
when faced man's inhumanity to man.

When the time comes, on that faithful day.
Quando chegar o
momento, nesse fatídico dia.

What happened to you, Raymond?

What possessed you
to become Jimmy?

Teaching was the greatest joy of my life,
to fill a young mind with principles, ideas.

The excitement of the purity
of the potential of facing...

...the new world a better world
than that we live in now.

My father was so proud.

I was top in my class, he...

But was sensitive, sensitive. He was sensitive
and the.. once my theories became clearer,

...and the radical clarity
that was my fate to expound, he...

I could take the derision
and the humiliation, I lived with.

But, but, my father, it
killed him. They killed him.

And they killed Raymond Gregory.

I could still save the world, detective.

What's taking that ambulance so long?

Yes!

You see?

You want to tell me than,
about what happened to the last three?

Look at me.
Look at me.

Why would somebody do this?

My mother died when
I was 8 and a half years old.

She was singing,
and then she hit the floor.

That was the last day
I ever saw my daddy sober.

Look at me, Catherine.

Look at me.
Look at me.

Christopher, hold me.

What are you laughing at, Grant?

Me? Laughing at a joke, Christopher.

I know why I'm gonna die,
Pettis. Good old karma.

Only thing I'm worried about is the joke
might be on me. Might be on me.

I think this is a
joke going on, Christopher.

And I think you are telling that.

I think maybe she is
helping you tell it, Christopher.

They say, I ran a red light.

Bam!

Hey, that's like a freak train.

Two of those boys.
They died.

It's not over, Grant.

We can still make it.

You are so stupid.

We are still alive.

You keep telling yourself that.

You are so full of shit.

Wait a minute. He can see us,
and he can hear us.

Doesn't that mean that there
is a camera in here? Somewhere?

If he can see us,
where is the camera?

Pettis! Is your buddy down here?
Your old buddy Christopher.

And his girlfriend Catherine.

How long you guys have known each other?
You and Catherine?

You didn't just meet here, did you?
I don't think so, buddy.

Five minutes ago she says there might be a camera in here.
Há cinco minutos atrás ela disse
que talvez haja câmaras aqui.

There is gotta be somewhere,
where they put the camera.

And then... Ah, you
found a camera in here.

I've got something.

Coincidence?

Give me something.
What is it?

I don't know.

Grant, give me something heavy!

Give me something.

Get me!

Here.

There is something here.

What is it?

What is it?

James, open the door.

Look what you've done!
Look what you've done!

God!

No, make it stop!

I came here to start a new life!

I'm not buying it.
I'm just not buying it.

Stop!
Son of a bitch!

Be careful.

I feel cool here.

There's gotta be another room in there.

What is it?

Nothing.

Catherine, Catherine.
Look at me.

What, you want me to put my
hand in the hole in the wall?

Like you put Jessie's head
to the hole in the door?

Three nails in her head buddy,
yeah, three nails in her head.

Oh yeah, that's funny. What's next?
You wanna put my hand in the little hole?

My hand in that hole, will be... Gonna chop
my hand off, is that it? Is that it?

I like my hands, Christopher.
I like both of them.

Yeah. I've been watching you boy, I've been
watching you. You know what I think?

I think you are a nasty, nasty
little man. That's what I think.

I think you're a nasty little man,
and I think you are friends with Pettis.

Is your buddy down here?
Your old buddy, Christopher?

And his girlfriend Catherine?

How long have you known
Pettis, Christopher?

Make me to laugh at this
joke you guys are going on.

What's happening, boy?
What's going on, Christopher?

That's it.

That's it? What's it, boy?

I've had enough.

You've had enough?

Of you!

I've done nothing but
try and keep you calm,

...give you the chance
to get out of here.

Do you wanna lose your mind?
Do you wanna end up like them?

That's what you're aiming
for me to be? Like them?

I don't care about your story, Grant.

You're pathetic. I don't
care if you fry in here.

Who is pathetic now, Christopher?

Pettis! I'm coming for your woman.
You're gonna talk, bitch, you're gonna talk.

Talk.
Christopher.

Will you talk to me?
Will you talk to me?

You're the strongest.

Animal instincts, detective.
Only the strongest survive.

My experiment happened
exactly the way I predicted it.

Some will kill themselves, some
will kill, some will go insane.

It's genetic. The faultier brutest
lights not in our stars but in ourselves.

I'm gonna try to see to get
the help you need, Raymond.

You got to call Walter.
Yes, call Walter.

Call Walter, call Walter.

Call him, call Walter.

It's time, Jack.

Dr. Adams sends his apologies. There is an
emegency on one of the wards tonight.

Yeah, no problem.

I hope he didn't give
you too much trouble.

No, he is not bad.
Guess he'll ajitate it.

Can't hold the twitch, hah?

He needs his medication.

How long have you
been treating him?

He signed himself over as a border
of state about four months ago.

Dr. Adams has been treating
him aggressively ever since.

It's hard to say, he's had
a lot of episodes lately.

When did he disappear?

Yesterday.

And who... you
reported him missing?

We always wait 24 hours, sir.
Hospital policy.

Can't say there's another
bit of imagination, hah?

I can take him now, unless of course,
you want to keep him for the night.

No, no. Thanks.

You take him with you.

Thank you for your help.

Yeah, good luck.
Be careful.

No, I'm on the way now.

What are you wearing?

No, why?

Nothing.

His vital signs are stable, Dr. Adams.

Thank you, that'll be all.

I'm quite upset
with you, Raymond.

Going to the press, that was
not part of our arrangement.

I'm sorry.

That's ok.
Everything is fine now.

You are a genius.

Living and touching
real human chaos.

It was the greatest
experience of my life.

It was beautiful.

You get some sleep.

You don't control him anymore.

He controls you.

Kill him, and come home.

I love you.
