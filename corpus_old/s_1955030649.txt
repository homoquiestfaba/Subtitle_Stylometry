Okay. Hey, Iâ€™m Frank. How you doing?

CASEY: Okay.

<i>The future can be scary.

<i>Unstable governments,

environmental collapse...

<i>CASEY: And scientific breakthroughs,

Could you please just stop interrupting?

CASEY: I will.
Just try to be a little more upbeat.

â€œUpbeatâ€?
Yeah, tell them what you like...

I canâ€™t tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.

Youâ€™re right. Sorry.

As I was saying...

<i>With every second that ticks by,
we get closer and closer...

<i>CASEY: Ooh, I know.
Tell them about when...

<i>FRANK: I canâ€™t tell them
anything until I tell them about this.

<i>CASEY: Then, can we please
just start somewhere else?

Fine. Where would you like me to start?

Well, you keep saying the future
wasnâ€™t always this way, right?

It wasnâ€™t.
When I was a kid, the future was...

Different, right?
Yeah.

Okay, cool. Then, start there.

All right. Well, when I was a kid,

the future was different.

Hello, sir.

May I help you?

My name is John Francis Walker.
Iâ€™m here to win the $50.

Is that so?

I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.

Seeing as how the bus ride
was kind of bumpy

and you know nitro.

I couldâ€™ve used
a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.

Bell Labs tested that
with their Rocket Belt

and I guess there were some issues

with maneuverability,
flight duration, and stuff.

Itâ€™s a jet pack.

Obviously.

ATHENA: You made this yourself?

Athena, what are you doing here?

Did you or didnâ€™t you?


What?

Did you make this yourself?

Yeah.

Why?

I guess I got tired of waiting around

for someone else to do it for me.

GOVERNOR NIX: Does it work?

Um, sure. Yeah.

Mostly.

Just doesnâ€™t really,
you know, technically...





...ï¬‚y.

<i>GOVERNOR NIX:
But if it did, â€œYou know,

â€œtechnically fly,â€
what would its purpose be?

How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?

Canâ€™t it just be fun?

Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than â€œfun.â€

Anythingâ€™s possible.

I donâ€™t know what that means.

If I was walking down the street,

and I saw some kid with
a jet pack fly over me,

Iâ€™d believe anythingâ€™s possible.

Iâ€™d be inspired.

Doesnâ€™t that make the world
a better place?

Well, I suppose it would.

If it worked.

<i>Unfortunately...

it does not.

And if it doesnâ€™t work,
it has no purpose at all.

Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.

But I can make it work!

Thatâ€™s the spirit.

Until then, young man,

have fun.

Absolutely not.

I like him.

Athena, no.

What makes you think
youâ€™re gonna make this thing fly?

Iâ€™m optimistic.

Youâ€™re wasting your time.
Iâ€™m not!

Damn contraption.

Itâ€™s not a contraption!

It doesnâ€™t work.

I can make it work.

No, you canâ€™t!

Iâ€™m not giving up.

Donâ€™t turn around. Be cool.

What did I just tell you?

Sorry.
Stop talking.

Look over there. Five oâ€™clock.

You know, on a clock?

Where the five is.
Oh.


That way.

Iâ€™m going with them.

You count to 20, then follow us.
Donâ€™t get spotted.

Who are you?

NATE: Identify yourself!
[PANTING]

Nate!

If you wake up Dad, I will crush you.

You shouldnâ€™t sneak out.

Well, you shouldnâ€™t still need a wubby.

Dad says itâ€™s okay to sleep with.

Thatâ€™s because
he doesnâ€™t want you to grow up.

Were you at the platform again?

What do you do out there?

Are you trying to stop them
from taking it down?


That would make me a criminal.

And a pretty terrible role model

to impressionable youth
such as yourself.

But if someone else did it...

Iâ€™d have to assume they believed

even the teeniest of actions

could change the future.

How can you be sure?

Because I know how things work.

Why are they taking the platform down?

Because itâ€™s hard to have ideas

and easy to give up.

But you wonâ€™t. Right?

Never.


Hey, Dad. Heading to school.

I made you lunch.
Hey!

Wrap it up.

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

How did you do...

You would have gotten it.

[MOBILE RINGING]

Yeah, Eddie Newton.

What?

All three cranes?

All right, Douglas.
Thanks for the call. Bye.

Everything okay?

Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral is down again.

Weird.

Really weird.

Well, at least you get the day off.

Actually, theyâ€™re bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando

so I will be back to work by noon.

Thatâ€™s fantastic.

Case.

Yeah?

Nothingâ€™s gonna stop them
from taking down that platform.

Nothing. And when weâ€™re done...

Iâ€™m out of a job.

Thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do about it.

Itâ€™s inevitable.

Then youâ€™ll find something else.

Youâ€™re a NASA engineer.

With nothing to launch.

There are two wolves.

<i>EDDIE: Case.

You told me this story my entire life

and now Iâ€™m telling you.

There are two wolves

and theyâ€™re always fighting.

One is darkness and despair.

The other is light and hope.

Which wolf wins?

Come on, Case.

Okay. Fine, donâ€™t answer.

Whichever one you feed.

Good.

Eat.

Come on.

Mutually assured destruction.

Today, any nuclear country or terrorist

is capable of inflicting damage

on a massive scale

with weapons of...

Environmental entropy.

The polar ice caps
arenâ€™t waiting for us to decide

if climate change is real.

Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.

Theyâ€™re all punching
our one-way ticket to...

Dystopia. By definition, â€œnot perfect.â€

Huxleyâ€™s <i>Brave New World</i>...

Bradburyâ€™s <i>Fahrenheit 451...

Orwellâ€™s <i>1984</i>.

Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels

are actually happening right now

and they seem to be getting worse.

Yes, Miss Newton?


Sorry?

I get things are bad.
But what are we doing to fix it?

Something highly unusual
is happening, and...

Okay. My point is...

<i>Iâ€™m fine. I will continue to be fine.

<i>Iâ€™m not on drugs. I havenâ€™t joined a cult.

<i>I wonâ€™t be gone long.

<i>And I will call again soon.

<i>I love you, Dad.

[WHIRRING]
[SCREAMS]

Oh, my God! Are you okay?

Yes. Fine, thank you.

I thought I broke you or something.

[COUNTRY SONG
PLAYING ON RADIO]

what you gonna do?

I should drive.

Casey, I know you have
no reason to trust me.

But Iâ€™ve been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

Now, please,

pull over.

Of all the people you could give
one of those pins to...

Why me?

Because youâ€™re special.


You are.

So, this guy weâ€™re gonna go see...


...whatâ€™s his name?

His name is Frank.

<i>Frank Walker.

Heâ€™s special, too.


[TRUCK SPEEDING OFF]
[GASPS]

Hey! Wait, what are you doing?

Just great.

[DOG BARKING]
[GASPS]

[CHAIN RATTLING]


Where are your paw prints?

That is cool.


I can hear you, you know.

FRANK: Go away.
Didnâ€™t you see the dog?

Yeah. Itâ€™s a hologram.

How did you do that in daylight?

Itâ€™s pretty impressive.
Who are you?

What do you want?

Youâ€™re Frank Walker, right?

My nameâ€™s Casey,
and I want you to take me there.

Take you where?

To the place I saw when I touched this.

[LOUD VIBRATION]


[CASEY GROANING]

Whereâ€™d you get this?

A little girl.

Athena.

Where is she?

She ditched me here.


Of course she did.

Look, wherever you came from, kid,
go back.

No, I want you to take me there.
What I saw...

What you saw is gone.

This, what youâ€™re looking for,
it doesnâ€™t exist any more.

No. I feel like I have to go.

Like Iâ€™m supposed to go.

Why?

Because theyâ€™re saving a seat
on the rocket ship just for you?

What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded

decades ago.

It was an invitation that never went out

because the damn party got cancelled.

You are not supposed to do anything.

Youâ€™ve been manipulated to feel

like youâ€™re part of something incredible.

Like you were special.

But you werenâ€™t.


Youâ€™re not.

So thatâ€™s a no?

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

[RADIO FREQUENCIES TUNING]

[MONITOR BEEPING]

Son of a...

Ah!

Oh, you little...


You know, I can call the cops anytime.

Anytime!

You have...

Iâ€™m giving you five seconds...
[LOUD VIBRATION]

[GRUNTING]
[LAUGHING]


CASEY: I am not leaving!

Either tell me how to get there or kill me!

If you touch anything in there,

thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™ll do!


FRANK: What are you doing?

Iâ€™m touching things!

[BANGING ON DOOR]

FRANK: Open this door now!

[GASPS]
FRANK: I mean it.

Iâ€™ll knock you out.

[BANGING ON DOOR]

Hey, whatâ€™s this doohickey
with the trombone slidey thing?

FRANK: Leave that alone. Iâ€™m serious!

Will you take me there?
No!

Then youâ€™re not serious!

[BANGING ON DOOR]

YOUNG FRANK: Oh, come on.

You didnâ€™t think that was funny?

Youâ€™re recording this?

If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,

have it for posterity.

I laughed.

You smiled. A smiIeâ€™s not a laugh.

Everyone laughs.

Itâ€™s a biological need.

ATHENA: Actually, it isnâ€™t.
Sleep is a biological need.

Iâ€™ve never seen you sleep, either.

Well, sooner or later,
Iâ€™m gonna make you laugh.

Until you do, Iâ€™m not gonna stop trying.

Maybe you should.

What?

Stop trying.

Why?

Must we record this?

[TIMER BEEPING]

Get out!
Wait a second.

What is that? Is that a countdown?
[GROANS]

I am not leaving. I deserve to
know whatâ€™s going on around here.

You deserve...
Yeah, I deserve some answers.

Answers to what?
I know that you were there.

You donâ€™t know anything.

How do you ever leave a place like that?

Because they threw me out!

They threw me out
and they looked every door back in.

Was it because you built
that something that you shouldnâ€™t have?

Who told you that?

And is that it?

The â€œsomethingâ€?

If I could tell you the date,

the exact date that youâ€™re gonna die,

would you wanna know?

How would you know?

Letâ€™s just say I did.

What are you, a psychic?
No, thatâ€™s not the point.

Then what is your basis for knowing?

Itâ€™s a hypothetical.
Itâ€™s a stupid hypothetical.

Oh, just use your imagination. All right?

All right.
Okay.

Letâ€™s accept that there is a world

where I know, with absolute certainty,

the exact time of your death.

Now, you want me to tell you or not?

Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldnâ€™t?

But...

what if accepting my death
is what causes it?

So the answer is yes.

I would want you to tell me.

But I wouldnâ€™t believe you.
You have to believe me.

Why? Donâ€™t we, like,
make our own destiny and stuff?

What?

Who are you, kid?

[ALARM BEEPING]

Is that bad?

FRANK: Oh!

Oh, hell.

Oh, hell!

They followed you here?

What? Who?

Robots.

Iâ€™ve never seen them before.

<i>DAVE CLARK: John Francis Walker.

<i>You have been permitted to live

<i>based upon your
agreed non-intervention.

<i>You are now harbouring
a fugitive element.

<i>Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.

<i>You have one minute to comply.

Thanks.
Donâ€™t thank me yet.



[GUNSHOT]
[GASPS]

Wait.



Come on!


Letâ€™s go!


John Francis Walker,
by authority of Governor Nix,

this unit has been authorized...
[GRUNTS]

<i>[DISTORTED VOICE]
. . . to extinguish your life.


Okay.

[CONTINUES GRUNTING]

Okay.

All right, thatâ€™s enough. Thatâ€™s enough!

Come on. Close the door.

Who the hell is Governor Nix?


Letâ€™s go. Come on.

Get in.

How is this a good idea?



[CASEY SCREAMS]


Move or sink, kid.

You were actually prepared for that?

My hat.
Leave it.

No, no, no. I canâ€™t go without it.

Itâ€™s my dadâ€™s.

Now I get it.

Too smart for your own good.

Father never understood you,
never supported you.

And now you wear his hat
as a badge of rebellion, right?

No. My dad is amazing.


Oh, wait a second.

Weâ€™re not talking about me, are we?

Why donâ€™t we just get you
to your amazing dad

and pretend this never happened?

Hop on.

The batteryâ€™s dead.
No, itâ€™s not.

Then maybe itâ€™s the points.

No, itâ€™s not.

Whenâ€™s the last time you checked...

You know, youâ€™re not helping. You...

Get down. Now.

Wait.

Hello, Frank.

Are you going to shoot me?

Iâ€™m deciding.

Could you decide in the truck?

Because we really should get going.

Wait.

Why? So more robots can show up?

Sheâ€™s one of them.

Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

Aw... Move over.

Frank...
Not yet.

What are you thinking?
Why would you drag her into this?

I didnâ€™t drag her into anything.
I gave her a pin.

She did the rest.

Just like you.

Oh, donâ€™t even.
Where did you even find the pin?

I was there. They destroyed â€˜em.

Not all of them.
I made it out with nearly a dozen.

So you give one to a teenager.

Hey, I got a 73 on the
Feinberg/Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

You got a 73? Thatâ€™s not possible.
Hmm.

Heâ€™s jealous because he scored a 41.

You know what? I was eleven.

I was eleven!

Hey, donâ€™t touch that!

This is a one-kiloton detonation.
It is not a toy.

Do not mess with my stuff.

You got it?
Sorry!

I didnâ€™t begin with her, you know.

I wasted years
on other potential candidates.

Potential candidates? For what?


You still think youâ€™re recruiting,
Donâ€™t you?

Do not ask her any more questions.

Sheâ€™s gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.

What countermeasure shutdown thing?

Did you tell her you had
a countermeasure shutdown thing?

She was annoying me.


Ah, get used to that, kid.

One minute,
sheâ€™s promising you a beautiful future,

the next thing you know,
sheâ€™s leading it to your house to kill you.

Iâ€™m sorry, but time is running out
and you needed motivation.

Motivation for what?

We need to go back over, Frank.

Back over there?

Yes, yes, Frank,
we need to go back over.

Good. Great. Thatâ€™s just great.

You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.
Letâ€™s jump on the hive.

Thatâ€™s a terrible analogy.

Thatâ€™s a fantastic analogy.
What do you know about analogies?

You know, youâ€™re impossible to talk to
when youâ€™re like this.

I am like this
because you derailed my life.

Again.

Frank, itâ€™s not personal.

Itâ€™s just programming.

Ah.

Weâ€™re here!

FRANK: Where are you going?

This is where
your wire stationâ€™s located, isnâ€™t it?

We need to get to The Spectacle.

Spectacle?
Hey.

Are you insane?

They know that you sent her to me.

Theyâ€™re gonna be waiting for us.

Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and weâ€™ll go without you.

I donâ€™t have the Edison tube.

Itâ€™s in your bag.

I have x-ray vision.

When did you get x-ray vision?

Oh, sheâ€™s full of surprises.

I know all about her surprises.

Chief among them is this.
She doesnâ€™t care about you.

All that charm and the sense of purpose,
and the cute little smile...

itâ€™s all just software.

Itâ€™s ones and zeroes. Thatâ€™s it.

Trust me, when you get there,
youâ€™re on your own.

What happened to you two?

He thinks I hurt him.

No, you hurt a dumb kid
that was stupid enough to fall...


You were many things, Frank Walker.

But you were never dumb.

Why donâ€™t you just give me
the Edison tube, and...

FRANK: Iâ€™m not giving you anything.

Iâ€™m...

All right.

You want in? Iâ€™ll bring you in.

Why not?

Itâ€™s better than waiting
around here and getting

hunted and killed, et cetera, et cetera.

Thatâ€™s the spirit.

â€œEt ceteraâ€? Whatâ€™s the â€œet ceteraâ€?

[MACHINE POWERING UP]

What kind of cables are these?

The kind that transmit people.

People? Like us?

What, like a miniature teleport...

Do I have to explain everything?

Canâ€™t you just be amazed and move on?

This is all wired to the dish up there.

Are you... Are you using satellite?

I know how things work.

Well, zippity-doo for you.

Wrap this around your eyes, tight.

Why?

Because justice is blind.

Just do it, kid.

You want me to put this over my head?

If this takes off my eyebrows...

Shut up, open your mouth,
tilt your head back.


Itâ€™s powder. Are we at vanâ€™t Hoff?

Good to go!

FRANK: Good. You set it for the Tower?

There is still a receiver there?

ATHENA: Last I checked.

How long ago was that?

25 years ago.

Roughly.

They threw you out, too?

CASEY: Okay, guys. Killer robots.

All right.

Itâ€™s gonna be
bright, cold, and really loud.

Youâ€™re gonna lose 90% of your
blood sugar in 1/100th of a second

and youâ€™re gonna wish you were dead.

But then itâ€™ll be over.

Donâ€™t pee on us.

This sounds spectacular.

Why now? Why her?

Because she hasnâ€™t given up.

You think she can fix it.

What makes you say that?

Can she, Athena?

I have no idea.

Letâ€™s go find out.

[VOICE BREAKING]
Is it... Is this normal?

[DISTORTED YELLING]

[DISTORTED GROANING]


Thirsty.


FRANK: Youâ€™re not dying!
Iâ€™m dying.

Thereâ€™s Coke in the fridge.




Help yourself.

We have no idea how many are here

but weâ€™re damn sure
they know weâ€™re coming.

So, we move quickly. You follow me.

No questions. Got it?

Got it.


Excuse me.

Weâ€™re in Paris?

Would you stop being so amazed?

I thought you wanted me to be amazed.

I want you to stop yammer...

[MAN ANNOUNCING OVER PA
IN FRENCH]

Towerâ€™s closing.

Aw, hell.

Come on.

Now, you and I are gonna be
on a watch list,

but they may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.

â€œMay notâ€?
May not.

So, you walk over there,
you take this, you tap him on the neck.

If heâ€™s human, it knocks him right out.

And if itâ€™s a robot?
Uh...

[CLANGS]
Hey!

Youâ€™ll just piss it off.

Fantastic.

Sheâ€™s got guts. You gotta give her that.

[MAN SPEAKING FRENCH]

CASEY: Ah, yes,
but I was just, you know...


Human!

The French hated this thing
when Eiffel first unveiled it

at the Paris Worldâ€™s Fair.

They thought it was an eyesore.

Eiffel didnâ€™t care, though.
It wasnâ€™t meant to be a monument.

It was meant to find another world.

<i>Les Quatre Premiers.</i>
Plus Ultraâ€™s First Four.

They were a part of all this?

Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla,

and Mr. Edison.

They designed this antenna
that weâ€™re inside.

Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower is an antenna?

Now I finally answer your question,
youâ€™re gonna interrupt me?

Yes.

Tesla designed the antenna to observe
every kind of frequency out there.

Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.

And they found exactly
what they were looking for.

And then Edison tried to take credit for it,
because these two hate each other.

ATHENA: Frank...
Because of alternating...

Stay on topic.

Yeah. All right, well...

There were always rumours
of a secret entrance

the Four kept just for themselves.

A one-way ticket

in case of emergencies.

The Spectacle.

[PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

[HORN BLOWING]

You ainâ€™t seen nothing yet, kid.


[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

Itâ€™s a rocket.

Theyâ€™re coming.

All right.

Buckle up!

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

Whatâ€™d he say?

Pretty much what youâ€™d expect.

Tell him to hang on.

[SPEAKS FRENCH]

Whoo-hoo!

[CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING]

Why are we going back?

Weâ€™re not. Weâ€™re going through

to another dimension.

So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?

This part may get a little weird.



[METAL SCRAPING]

ATHENA: Casey. Wake up.

Casey.

Casey. Wake up.

Weâ€™re here.

Now what?

You tell me.

I tell you? This was your idea.

I donâ€™t have ideas.

I just find the people who do.

So thereâ€™s no plan?
Thereâ€™s a plan.

You just havenâ€™t come up with it yet.

But you should do that soon.

Ah, thatâ€™s just terrific.

Here, hide this.

Absolutely.

Wait. Is that
the one-kiloton detonation thingy

you told me not to play with?

Right now, itâ€™s our insurance policy.

Thereâ€™s a good chance theyâ€™re gonna try
to kill us right out of the gate.

So weâ€™re just gonna stand here?

Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

Here it comes.

Take the bag.

Frank.

David.

You look well.

Age becomes you.

Thanks. You should try it.

I donâ€™t know. I think Iâ€™ll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.

Comes in chocolate now.
Ah. Yum.

Hello, Athena.

I started to think
you were never coming home.

Where, oh, where have you been?

Doing my job.

Your job?

Iâ€™m sorry. Were we not clear

when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?

I got that sense when you
called me â€œbloody obsoleteâ€

and tried to disassemble me.

Well, youâ€™ve certainly
caused quite a commotion

by launching an antique rocket ship
out of the Eiffel Tower.

Under normal circumstances,

weâ€™d be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax.

Fortunately, for all of us,

doesnâ€™t really matter now, does it?

CASEY: Why doesnâ€™t it matter?

And who might you be?

Iâ€™m Casey.

Newton.

And who might you be?

David Nix.

Pleasure.

Well, Frank, itâ€™s been
wonderful catching up,

but as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile

and the consequences of violating it,

I have to ask...

what the hell are you doing here?

I think she can fix it.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Her.

I think she can fix it, David.

Wait, what?

Iâ€™ve been pirating your signal.

Every time you turn it on here,
I can see it there.

And it flickered.

The percentage dropped, David.

Impossible.

You donâ€™t believe me?
Letâ€™s go find out right now.

Iâ€™m sorry, what can I fix?

The world, Ms Newton.

He thinks you can fix the world.

Is that like a portal to Earth?

No. It is a bridgeway to Earth.

Welcome back to the Monitor, Frank.

Itâ€™s something, isnâ€™t it?

Yeah, itâ€™s something.

Donâ€™t worry about the light show.

Itâ€™s perfectly safe.

Am I supposed to do something?
Uh-huh.

Okay, could you be a bit more specific?

Because fixing
the world sounds a little...

Just be yourself.

Gotcha.

GOVERNOR NIX: Flashes of the future.

What are those?

Flashes of future.

This is us a few seconds from now.

This whole tower
funnels energy via tachyon,

a particle that moves
significantly faster than light.

We discovered them
almost 40 years ago.

Your physicists are still arguing
over whether they exist.

GOVERNOR NIX: Oh, dear.

Too late.

Oh, dear.

Too late.

GOVERNOR NIX: So, on with the show.

Weâ€™ve enhanced
the interface significantly

but it still functions
on your original algorithm.

You have something to show me, Frank?

Show me.

Pick a place.

What?
A location anywhere in the world.

Pick one.

Canaveral.

Cape Canaveral.

Easy, easy.

The interface is oriented from
your hands to the centre of the Earth.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

You trained her obviously.

I just met her yesterday.

She knows how things work.

<i>You told me this story my entire life
and now Iâ€™m telling you.

CASEY: How is this possible?

GOVERNOR NIX: We are
millions of exponential deviances

away from the dimension you call home.

Frank had the novel idea
of building this machine

so that we could keep in touch.

This is three days ago.

Relatively.

Thatâ€™s space/time humour.

Because tachyons
travel faster than light,

once we harness them...

You can see backwards in time.

Not just backwards.

Youâ€™re kidding.

No.

What happened?

GOVERNOR NIX: Keep going.

Just a little further.


[INDISTINCT CLAMOURING]

Thatâ€™s enough.

Thatâ€™s enough, kid.


Thatâ€™s my house.

GOVERNOR NIX: It would have been
nice if Frank had prepared you for this...

but Iâ€™m afraid the world is ending.

It is certain, it is unavoidable...

and it is coming.

When?

This is 58 days from now.

58 days?

But whatever caused this could happen
any time after the static starts.

It could be a month.

It could be sooner.

Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

I know what I saw.

So why arenâ€™t you telling anyone?

The whole planet is gonna die

and youâ€™re just sitting here?

Weâ€™re not gonna die.

This is your world, not ours.

Weâ€™ll be perfectly fine here.

Then why donâ€™t you let people in?

Tell her, David.

Oh, Frank.

All those years in exile,
and you still donâ€™t understand.

These people are driven by savagery.

If we told them about this place

then that would happen here to us.

Then nothing would survive.

But it hasnâ€™t happened yet!

Actually, it has happened.
You just havenâ€™t accepted it.

Well, I donâ€™t accept it!

Did you see that?

Did you see that?

David, I know that you saw that.

That means that there is a chance.
Thereâ€™s at least a chance...


That went quite well, donâ€™t you think?

What happened?

Youâ€™re being deported.

Again.

Well, thatâ€™s Nix for you.

No new ideas.

Apparently, your 1I10,000 variable
in the inevitability

wasnâ€™t convincing enough
to change his mind.


Be gentle.

You Okay?

You know, youâ€™d think
somewhere in the zillions

of questions that I was asking you,

you could have said,

â€œOh, Casey, that stuffâ€™s
not really the issue

â€œbecause our future-predicting
machine says weâ€™re all gonna die.â€

We did sort of hint at it.

This place has nothing to do with hope.

Itâ€™s the opposite of hope.

Come on. Donâ€™t say that.
Why not?

You said it.

No wonder you gave up.

Thatâ€™s before I knew about you.

I mean, you really...

You really are special.

Why do you people
keep saying that to me?

Iâ€™m not!

Whyâ€™d you even give me this, hmm?

You showed me a place
that was amazing and incredible

and it was a lie.

If youâ€™re gonna zap an idea
into peopleâ€™s heads,

you should really make sure
that itâ€™s the truth.

Because you canâ€™t do that.
You canâ€™t just zap...

[RADIO FREQUENCIES TUNING]

What?

Zap an idea into peopleâ€™s heads.

You were pirating the signal.

How?
What?

At your house.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.

You were boosting the feed
from that Monitor thing.

How did you do that?
No big deal.

Theyâ€™re running so much
power through it now,

a ham radio could pick it up.

Itâ€™s just a matter of
finding the right frequency...

You grabbed a signal
from another dimension.

From a machine here.

That means itâ€™s transmitting there.

What if itâ€™s not just predicting the future?

Itâ€™s broadcasting it.

When I touched this thing

for a few minutes
it felt like anything was possible.

So then why canâ€™t the opposite happen?

What if the Monitor is just a giant pin?

But instead of making you think positive,

it makes you think negative and it...

And itâ€™s convincing the whole world
to feed the wrong wolf.

We need to turn that thing off.

[DOOR OPENS]

Itâ€™s time to go home.

FRANK: David. David.

Ah, itâ€™s uninhabited and uncharted.
Listen to me.

But it looks like a lovely place
to spend your last days.

David... The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.

It isnâ€™t just receiving tachyons.

It is taking a possible future and...

And amplifying it, transmitting it,
like a feedback loop.

Itâ€™s a self-fulfilling prophecy

thatâ€™s coming from right there.

But itâ€™s not just showing people
the end of the world,

itâ€™s giving them the idea over and over
again until they just accept it!

Itâ€™s a ticking time bomb,
and weâ€™re the ones that lit the fuse.

We still have 58 days
to try and change things.

But nothing will work
as long as that thing is still on.

Young lady, Iâ€™m gonna assume

that your knowledge of tachyonic fusion
is a little sketchy.

Shutting it down is impossible.

There is no off.

CASEY: Iâ€™m telling you what itâ€™s doing.

Why donâ€™t you care?

Because heâ€™s the one thatâ€™s doing it.

Right?

Letâ€™s imagine.

If you glimpsed the future

and were frightened by what you saw,

what would you do with that information?
You would go to...

Who? Politicians? Captains of industry?

And how would you convince them?
With data? Facts?

Good luck.

The only facts they wonâ€™t challenge

are the ones that keep the wheels
greased and the dollars rolling in.

But what if...

What if there was a way
of skipping the middleman

and putting the critical news
directly into everyoneâ€™s head?

The probability of widespread
annihilation kept going up.

The only way to stop it was to show it.

To scare people straight.

Because what reasonable human being
wouldnâ€™t be galvanized

by the potential destruction of everything
they have ever known or loved?

To save civilization,

I would show its collapse.

But how do you think
this vision was received?

How do you think people responded

to the prospect of imminent doom?

They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate Ã©clair.

They didnâ€™t fear their demise,
they repackaged it.

It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.

The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse

and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.

Meanwhile, your Earth
was crumbling all around you.

Youâ€™ve got simultaneous epidemics
of obesity and starvation.

Explain that one.

Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

The glaciers melt.

Algae blooms all around you.

The coal mine canaries
are dropping dead,

and you wonâ€™t take the hint!

In every moment,

there is the possibility of a better future.

But you people wonâ€™t believe it.

And because you wonâ€™t believe it,

you wonâ€™t do what is necessary
to make it a reality.

So you dwell on this terrible future,

and you resign yourselves to it.

For one reason,

because that future
doesnâ€™t ask anything of you today.

So, yes,

we saw the iceberg,
we warned the Titanic.

But you all just steered for it anyway,
full steam ahead.

Why?

Because you want to sink.

You gave up.

Thatâ€™s not the Monitorâ€™s fault.

Thatâ€™s yours.

Put them through.

Thanks for visiting, Frank.

It was genuinely nice to see you again.

Hmm.


What are you doing?
Not giving up.



Oh!

[BRACELET BEEPS]

Look out!


Get the thing!
What thing?

The thing I gave you
when we first got here!

Arm it! Get on the platform!

Ah!

Frank, get out!

Ah!

Get out of there!

<i>FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Four. Three.

CASEY: Close the portal!

<i>- Two. One.</i>
Close the portal!



FRANK: Are you all right?

CASEY: The bombâ€™s gone.

Can you stand?
Yeah.

GOVERNOR NIX: Frank!
[LASER POWERING UP]


No.

CASEY: The bombâ€™s gone.

FRANK: Can you stand?
CASEY: Yeah.

Frank!
[LASER POWERING UP]


What happened? Is she okay?

I need to get her to a repair module.

Frank!

No oneâ€™s going to repair me.

Not in time.

I need to tell you something now.

Oh, darn.

Iâ€™m shutting down.

<i>[DISTORTED] Iâ€™m shutting down.

Iâ€™m going to lose sync.

Donâ€™t look at me like that.

If I lose sync itâ€™s not failure.

I know.

There are things I need to tell you
before the final...

Before the automated program kicks in.

Iâ€™m a machine.

I never thought that was bad

until I saw your face
when you found out I was.

I always knew.

No, you didnâ€™t.

<i>FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Systems failing.

<i>Activating last thoughts
saved for Frank Walker.

<i>ATHENA: Log 15: September...

<i>1965.

<i>Frank Walker is looking at me
in a manner that is difficult to recognize.

<i>It seems imperative to explain to him

<i>that I am an Audio-Animatronic...

Athena...

<i>But I am concerned
that he may be adversely affected

<i>when he finds out that I am not human.

<i>He has potential.

<i>I donâ€™t want to damage it.

<i>He needs someone to believe in him.

<i>And I am fulfilling that need.

<i>He is my top recruit.

<i>Log 24, October, 1965.

<i>Iâ€™m having unusual thoughts
towards Frank Walker.

<i>I suspect a flaw
in my empathy interface.

<i>I am thinking I should report it.

<i>But I havenâ€™t.

<i>I cannot explain why.

<i>Log 78, April...

<i>1984.

<i>Frank Walker has been banished
by Governor Nix.

<i>He says he has lost hope

<i>and he holds me responsible for
having given it to him in the first place.

<i>I do not understand this.

<i>He says I never will

<i>because I do not feel
anger or disappointment.

<i>Or love.

<i>FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
End recording.

I was designed to find dreamers.

I found you.

And lost you.

Till I found her.

Casey.

Dreamers need to stick together.

Itâ€™s not programming.

Itâ€™s personal.

[SYSTEM BEEPING]

The Monitor.

The bomb is gone. But Iâ€™m not, yet.

There isnâ€™t much time.

My self-destruct, use it.

You know what to do, Frank.

Help get it right this time.


I thought you canâ€™t have ideas.

Well, what do you know?

What do you know.

[BEEPING SPEEDS UP]

Systems failing.

Frank?
Yeah?

Do you want to know
why you could never make me laugh?

Why?

Because youâ€™re not funny.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

You can let me go now.

Goodbye, Frank.

[BEEPING RAPIDLY]

Goodbye, Athena.


Oh, bollocks.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]




FRANK: Now what?

Youâ€™re asking me?

This was your idea, kid.

Yeah.

You think it Will work?

I guess we have to make it work.


<i>FRANK: So, weâ€™re making it work.

<i>CASEY: First order of business,

<i>get the door back open.

<i>Couldnâ€™t hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.

Next. . .

<i>FRANK: Put the party back on.

<i>And print out some new invitations.

<i>Which brings us to
why weâ€™re here today.

A year ago,
it was all supposed to be over.

We shouldnâ€™t even be here.

But we are.

It isnâ€™t hard to knock down
a big, evil building

thatâ€™s telling everybody
that the worldâ€™s gonna end.

What is hard

is figuring out what to build in its place.

And if weâ€™re gonna do that,

we canâ€™t do it alone.

Weâ€™re gonna need all of you.

Frank Walker, may I ask a question?
Sure.

The search parameters youâ€™ve given us,

while mathematically sound, are a bit...

undeï¬ned.

Could you be more specific, please?

Well, Miss Newton,

you wanna tell our new recruiters
what theyâ€™re looking for?

Dreamers.

We are looking for dreamers.

Anyone who will feed the right wolf.

So, I once told your predecessor

that she was nothing
but a combination of ones and zeroes.

I was wrong.

She was much more than that.

You are much more than that, too.

So, go out there
and do what she would have done.

Find the ones who havenâ€™t given up.

Theyâ€™re the future.
