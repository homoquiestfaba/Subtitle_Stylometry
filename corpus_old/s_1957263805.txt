[light music]

All right, thank you.

Hi, how are you, beautiful?

There you go, hot and waiting
for you.

Thank you so much.

[Waitress] Good night.
Thank you.


All right, let's shut it down,
huh?

Oh good, going home.

Okay, motherfuckers, let's go!

Give me what I want or I'll
give you what you don't want.

Give the money right
now, you wop, let's go.

Hurry up!

Okay, okay, please.

Hurry up, give it to me.

All right, all right,
you got what you came for.


What the fuck you looking at?

That's not all the money.

What the fuck you said?

That's not all the money.

The old wop got a safe in the
back.

[dramatic music]

You heard the little nigger,
let's go.

Okay, okay.

What the fuck you waiting on,
let's go.

This shit is not a game.

Get out my way!

Little nigger, where is the
safe?

Second bottom drawer
of the file cabinet.

Jump to it, motherfucker,
let's go.

Okay, okay.

Get the money, cracker nigger!

I will kill your woman.

Just give him the money!

Hurry the fuck up and get my
money!

Put the money in the bag, all of
it.

God, I hate to rob you, my
niggas, yes.

Let's go!

Hurry, Roberto!

Nigger, today, listen to your
bitch.

I got shit to do.

Give me my fucking money.

Any more money left?

[gun firing]

This is one nice fucking
piece.

Like my wife, almost too
fucking pretty to shoot.

I'll tell you what, I'll
take the lot of them.

Go see Frankie in the back,
he'll set you straight.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you
going, heh?

Come on, I open up the joint in
an hour.

You think I want my
customers to look at these?

Hey, hey, hey!

There he is, this is him.

Look who's here, the man of
the hour.

How you doing, kid?

What's your name?

Bernard James.

Bernard, heh?

I tell you the truth, I
appreciate what you did, kid.

But the truth be told, if
you didn't open your mouth

about the safe, we wouldn't
be here in the first place.

What the fuck were you thinking
about,

jeopardizing my fucking money
for fucking pizza money?

Roberto gave me a job to
help take care of my mom.

I like Roberto, he's a good man.

I like you, kid.

I like a kid who stands up for
his friends

and takes care of his mother.

You're good in my book.

But one thing I'm not too crazy
about is your name, Bernard.

I don't know, you don't
look like a Bernard.

What do I look like?

There was a guy I
come up with years ago,

he didn't take shit from nobody.

He saved my life once, God rest
his soul.

He had fucking steel balls just
like you.

His name was Dutch.

How about we call you Dutch?

Dutch, yeah, it'd be
an honor, Mr. Cerrone.

All right, Roberto, hook
him up with the chop shop

in North Newark, all right.

All right.

Let the kid start earning for
a living.

You hungry, kid?

I got a guy in the back
fix you a fucking plate

of spaghetti make your hair
curl.


[Do Not Pass Me By"]

[choir clapping]

["Rock Your Baby"]

Have them bring my usual.

I'll be at my table in a few
minutes.

Sure, Miss Nichols.

["Rock Your Baby"]

[soft music]

Excuse me, but you're
at the wrong table.

Not if you're Michelle
Nichols.

Food is important to me.

I don't like being
interrupted while eating.

Make an appointment and
see me at my office.

Well, it's kind of an urgent
matter.


Bernard James.

Dutch.


You're a drug dealer.

Does that scare you?

I'm a criminal defense
attorney, Mr. James,

very little scares me.

This is a certified check.

You're incredibly naive if
you think you're the only rich

drug dealer in New Jersey who
needs my services, Mr. James.

Ms. Nichols, I'm not being
arrested for selling narcotics.

What are you being arrested
for?


That's not a crime.

Who's being naive now?

Black men are incarcerated six
times the rate of white males

if they're not killed first.

That's your defense because
white people get away with it,

you should too?

Oh, if you think it'll work,
I'm game.

I appreciate the offer, Mr.
James,

but I don't think I can
represent you.

Any particular reason why not?

No, but you haven't given
me a good reason why I should.

Well, Johnny Cochran wasn't
available.

And you're not very funny.

Oh, no disrespect to Johnny
Cochran, God rest his soul.

I meant it as a testament
of your legal skill.

The system is corrupt,

I just happen to care a little
bit more

than the people who work in the
system.

Oh, I think it's a
little bit more than that.

You're a true believer.

People of color are incapable
of receiving equality

of justice in the
American judicial system.

Sound familiar?

Fundamental principles
of the Sixth Amendment

are systematically undermined
by racism, economic disparity

and political oppression.

Are these your words?

How'd you get that?

It's good, it's better than
good.

I know what it is, I wrote
it second year Harvard Law,

what's your point?

We both believe in justice.

Now, I've been to prison, Ms.
Nichols.

It's not a pleasant place
and I'm never going back.

If I can't get a fair
trial with you in court,

I'll hold court on the streets.

That would be suicide.

No, it would be self defense.

What exactly are you being
charged with?

I think they'll know better
than me.

[dramatic music]

you're under arrest.

Cuff him.

He better look as good as he
does now

after he gets to booking.

Who the hell are you?

Michelle Nichols, his
attorney.

["Make Me Feel"]

Good morning, you're
watching Wake Up New Jersey.

I'm David Greenwood, we're
glad you could be here.

Let's get right to the top
story of the day, shall we?

It has now been six months
since alleged drug dealer,

Bernard Dutch James was arrested
at a New Jersey restaurant.

Now, ironically, Mr.
James was not picked up

for a drug-related offense,

rather this is more serious than
that.

He's been charged with
orchestrating the mass bombing

of a New Jersey police
station that led to the deaths

of 27 good officers and the
wounding of scores more.

It's an act many are calling
terrorism.

Now, Bernard James has always
denied these accusations

through his attorney, Michelle
Nichols, who just so happens

to be our guest on the program
today.

having me.

Now, I gotta say, Michelle,
when our viewers found out

that you were gonna be on the
program,

our social media pages basically
shut down

with the sheer amount of
comments people were leaving.

know if that's good or bad.

been going through a lot

of these comments and many of
them are less than flattering

towards you and your client.

And a good number of
them aren't even suitable

to air on television.

Does that worry you?

You know what worries me

and it should worry your
audience, too?

The Constitution mandates that
everyone should be afforded

a good and capable defense, not
just...

Yo, turn this up.

People get caught up in the
sound bytes on the internet

and suddenly volunteer

to abandon their Constitutional
rights

because they're not aware of the
facts.


What are the facts?

knows that William Brent

is responsible for this
heinous crime, yet he insists

on using the powers of the
district attorney's office

to persecute Mr. James.

But District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs believes your client

is complicit with the
actions of William Brent.

Well, you know what?

I believe I can fly, but the
judicial system doesn't operate

on what we believe.

It's about what you can prove.

And there is no evidence
of any malfeasance

or of culpable intent by Mr.
James.

You do need evidence.

Just because a person has been
arrested,

you can't automatically
conclude they're guilty.

[light music]

Documents were sent over.

When did this happen?

We're going in right now,
I gotta call you back.

Michelle Nichols, saw you on
TV.

You did an amazing job.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

We want the Wake Up New Jersey
piece

on all social media sites
and local news outlets.

Wait, I gotta call you back.

[light music]

honorable Judge Whitaker.


Bring in the jury.

Is the state ready to proceed
with its opening statement?

Hello, I am District
Attorney Anthony Jacobs

and I wanna thank you for
your attendance today.

I know some of you may deem
my gratitude unwarranted

because let's be honest, if
you didn't have to be here,

you probably wouldn't come,
right?

And I agree.

I'd much rather be playing golf

or going to my child's piano
recital

or just enjoying a quiet day at
home.

But I can't 'cause this is my
duty, just like it's your duty

to assure your fellow
citizens will remain safe,

just as it is the police to
do the same for you and I,

our civic duty.

But above and beyond our civic
duty,

above and beyond the inconvenience
duty sometimes imposes

on the dutiful, therefore it is
our right.

It is your right to be safe in
your home.

It is your right to
oversee the justice system

and it is your right to
be heard as citizens,

even if the uncivilized play
mockery

with our sense of security.

Now, we're all God-fearing
human beings and those of you

who aren't, well, you wouldn't
be here

if you didn't recognize the law.

And you certainly
wouldn't be sitting there

if you didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

So I say to you, what if
I could present to you

the very embodiment of wrong?

Would you hesitate to
look wrong in the face?

Would you banish wrong from our
society?

Would you turn away from guilt

if it was staring you right in
the face?

Well, I'm gonna give you that
chance.

Because I'm gonna prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

that Bernard James is the
embodiment of this city's wrong.

He is the root cause of fear
that is prevalent in this city

and the degradation of our civil
order.

It all stems from the
actions of this one man.

Bernard James is an
instigator, an agitator

and head of the organized crime

that has terrorized New
Jersey for the past 12 years.

You have a chance to look evil
in the face and in the name

of the state of New Jersey,
you say one word, guilty.

Thank you.

As the day is drawing long,
we'll continue these proceedings

tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

Your honor.

Thank you, Ms. Nichols.

Relax.

adjourned.

And let Jacobs'
statement be the last thing

the jury remembers before
they go to sleep tonight?

Don't worry about it.

[phone ringing]

D.

I'm not available to
take your call right now.

Please leave a message at the
tone.

["Burning Down the House"]

a young team of raiders

from all over New York
to steal cars as a kid.

And he was arrested and sent

to Mountain View Correctional
Facility

for trying to steal a
dozen BMWs at the port.

BMWs?

["We Made It"]

Y'all wanna make this shit
interesting?

Shit, shooting motherfuckers,
that'll make it interesting.

Shit, that's your answer for
everything.

What's better than that,
Angel?

Money.

What you thinking, Dutch?

I'm thinking whoever
has the fastest time,

the other three throw them a G
apiece.

Ooh, extra three grand, I'm
in.

All right then, let's do it.

["We Made It"]

You wanna roll?

["We Made It"]

Share.


Everybody give Angel her
share.

She did that.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a
minute.

Y'all know I was way faster than
Angel.

Yeah, you would've been

if you didn't waste time
picking up random bitches.

Man, whatever.

Hey, look, I ain't even
mad at you, man, 'cause look,

I see what it got you, playboy.

I ain't mad at you, go ahead.

Here, take your little money.

Yeah, come over here.

I got you, you know I got you.

I ain't tripping about that.

Mine is in there.

Whatever they want, it's on
me.

Roberto, man.

How you doing, kid?

Good, you?
Good.

You remember Qwan, Angel and
Craze.

Hey, how are y'all doing?

Oh man, we doing real good.
[Qwan laughs]

You got a minute, I need to
talk to you.

Yeah, whatever you want.

Get something to drink, man.

Hey, bartender.

$100 to the bartender.

So what's going on?

Fat Tony wanted me to talk to
you.

What, we do something wrong?

Nah, no, no not at all.

I think you been doing a great
job.

In fact, they wanted me to give
you this.

Damn, I don't even know
what to say, but thank you.

And there's more, all right.

He's taking you out of the car
business

and putting you into narcotics.

Man, what you mean he wanna
take us out

of the car business?

No, no, no, it's a
good thing, all right.

With your street connections,
it just makes sense.

You're gonna be working under
Frank.

You're gonna be making 10 times
the money

and have 10 times the
responsibility.

You think you can handle that?

Man, they haven't invented
a hustle I can't handle.

But what about my team?

Yeah, hire whoever you want.

There's enough money to
go around for everybody,

but if they shit on you,
that's your problem.

If they shit on us,
that's your problem, too.

And Frank is okay with that?

Comes from Fat Tony.

Frank doesn't have a choice
in the matter, all right.

But there's this guy.

He's got a 1956 Bel Air
Coupe, a real beauty.

Frank tried to buy it from the
guy,

but the guy wouldn't budge.

It would go a long way to
smooth things out with Frank

if you could get him that car.

You just tell me where
it's at and it's yours.

According to Frank, the
guy goes to Joe's Steakhouse

every day at 7 like clockwork,
parks with the valet.

You can consider it done.

Congratulations.

You've come a long way, kid,
huh?

I gotta give it to him,
he never thought small.

[dramatic music]

Hello, Mrs. Jasmine.

How are we doing?

I see you're doing well.

Thank you.
Absolutely, welcome back.



Always, yes sir.

[dramatic music]

Hi.
Excuse me.

Can you help me get a
package out of my trunk?

Sure, where's it at?

Right in here?
Yeah.

Where's it at right here?

What the...

[dramatic music]

[sirens wailing]


Get out of the car.

Out of the car, face forward.

Face forward!

Get down, get down.

Spread out, put your
hands behind your head.

Another kid was arrested
with him, Eqwan Taylor.

He was sent to Jamesburg.

Gladiator camp.

Eqwan Taylor was just added
to Jacob's witness list.

He's the reverend at First
Street Baptist Church

in Los Angeles.

Jacobs is using Taylor to
introduce Dutch's criminal past

to the jury.

Then we're gonna take a hit.

Maybe not, do we have anything

to impeach the good reverend's
testimony?

Nothing yet, but our
investigators

are still in LA working on it.

Get them to work faster.

In the meantime, I'm gonna
gut Jacobs' first witness.

name for the court, sir?

Kenneth Jackson.

currently reside?

In a halfway house off of
Broad Street.

And do you know Bernard James?

Of course I do, who don't?

He's sitting right over there.

And when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

Objection.
[Judge] Overruled.

Again, when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

Not until he came to Mountain
View.

And that would be Mountain
View

Correctional Facility, right?


And can you describe
Bernard James's stay

at Mountain View correctional
facility?

Well, from the jump, Dutch
came in like he had something

to prove, like he had
a chip in his shoulder.

He wasn't inside five minutes

and he was already stirring up
shit.

[dramatic music]

So Bernard James came into
prison a violent person,

is that correct?

I mean, he wasn't a killer or
nothing,

but he definitely made his
presence known.

And I respected that.

Was there any gang
activity at Mountain View?

Everybody was in a gang, if
that's what you wanna call it.

It was just cliqued up.

I mean, they got together
on a county versus county

or a city versus city basis.

Narc, nigga.

Fuck off me, man.

Sometimes it's street
versus street basis.

It depended on where you were at

to determine who you were with.

Now, I'm gonna ask you

was Bernard James involved in a
gang?

Everybody was, especially him.


Dutch ran Mountain View.

And if Newark was brought
up, he would be frontline.

He was the man, bottom line.

Thank you.

Your witness.

Mr. Jackson, you
testified that everybody

at Mountain View was in a gang.

That's right.

So were you in a gang?

Like I said, everybody was.

And if one gang member had a
problem

with another gang member,
they would do anything

to take them out, right?

Wasn't no picnic.

You had to do what you
had to do to survive.


Whatever it took.

Lie?

That's the least of it.


Guards won't let you kill
nobody, but short of it.

Good for them.

Are you from Newark?

No, ma'am.

I'm from North Bergen
Township, Hudson County.

A lot of tough guys
come out of North Bergen.

ma'am.

Are you a tough guy?

Let's just say I can hold my
own.

And you and Mr. James
were in a rival gang

at Mountain View, right?

What are you talking about?

You said earlier that
inmates at Mountain View

got together on a county versus
county

or city versus city basis.

Mr. James is from Newark,
you're from North Bergen,

therefore you're rivals, right?

We wasn't homies or nothing
like that

if that's what you asking.

That's why you're here
testifying today

because you and Mr. James were
rivals

and a gang member will do
anything

to take out a rival gang member,
right?

I don't know what you're
talking about.

So it wasn't true when you
say lying is the very least

you would do take out a rival
gang member?

Were you lying then or were you
lying now?

Which is it, Mr. Jackson?

Objection, argumentative.


Mr. Jackson, one last
question.

Where are you staying
while appearing in court?

The district attorney's
office put me up at the Hilton.

I'd imagine the Hilton is a
lot nicer

than the halfway house on Broad
Street.


Withdrawn, I'm done with
this liar, I mean, witness.

[light music]

Jacobs.

Gah, shit, it was supposed
to be done an hour ago.

What time?

5:30, it's gonna be ready.

But look, if I can't make
it, let's just leave the keys

at the service department.

Yeah, I know.

All right, bye, thanks.

I'm going to visit Roc and Angel

and I'm gonna make them a deal.

Okay.

There he is.

Roc, right?

I am District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

They treating you well in here?

District attorney Anthony
Jacobs, what you want?

Look, we know you're
not top of the chain.

We know it's Bernard James,
Dutch.

Now, I could cut a deal with you
right now

and have you back on the
streets in less than a month.

The only thing I want is Dutch.

You must not know me.

I ain't no snitch.

I respect that.

Oh, what was I thinking?

Congrats, on the baby, right?

What did you have a boy or a
girl?

I guess it really doesn't matter

because you won't be seeing
him or her for quite some time.

Now, what did you tell Aisha
that you didn't want your kids

to see you caged like an animal?

Look, get me some McDonald's.

When you come back, I
might remember something.

Can you do that?

Oh yeah, Big Mac, fries, Coke?

Yeah.
[DA] Done.

[light music]

How was the meal?

This'll last me till I get
out.

Okay, well, I guess we can
talk

about the bombing at the police
precinct.

Look, I already told you.

I ain't no fucking snitch.

Get the fuck outta here.

Wait a second, I thought
we had a deal here.

Yeah, the deal is get
the fuck outta here.

You're making a big mistake.

You will never see the light
of day, I guarantee it.

Get the fuck outta here!

[light music]

Get dressed.

your back, inmate.

What the fuck do you want?

You're a very pretty girl,
Angel.

Oh, [foreign language]

Let's see here.

Possession with the intent to
distribute,

accessory to murder.

That's 20 to life.

You won't be so pretty when
you get out, if you get out.

Yeah, look, I know how
much Dutch meant to you.

Took you out of that
hellhole on Dayton Street,

but you were young,
impressionable.

You didn't know what you were
doing.

And now, look where you are now.

I can make your time here
easier.

Do yourself a favor, testify
against him.

I'm not a fucking snitch.

I appreciate that loyalty.

Let me ask you, would
Dutch do the same for you?

Fuck you and fuck your deal.

Get that fucking cunt out of
my face.

I saw the way the jury
watched you, they like you.

They want you to win this.

I can dazzle the jury
with clever rhetoric,

make the men want me, make
the women wanna be me,

but when the show is over,
nothing is going to be able

to blind them from the fact

that there are 27 police
officers dead

and they're gonna want
someone to answer for it.

And that is gonna be Bernard
James.

You know what my wife tells
me?

That you have a shitty boss
that makes you work too much.

That trials aren't won by
clients, they're won by lawyers

and you're gonna win it for him.

That would be true if
our client was anyone else

but Bernard James.

His presence commands attention

and the jury, they can't
take their eyes off him

sitting there like a king
daring to find him guilty.

But all we need is one
juror looking for a reason

to let him go and you're
gonna be that reason.

[guns firing]

[tires screeching]

[dramatic music]

me into?

Good evening, counselor.

What the fuck did you get me
into?


Like hell you did.

I told you everything you need
to know

to represent me on this case.

Now tell me everything I don't
know

and I'll decide what's
important.

That wasn't our agreement.

Our agreement changed
the moment some nut case

in a Monte Carlo did a
drive-by on my house.

Are you sure it was a Monte
Carlo?

I'm asking the questions
and you're answering

or you're gonna need a new
lawyer.

[dramatic music]

[light music]

long time.

Too long.

Man, finally some fresh air,
free air.

Nobody telling me what to do,
I'm good.

Dutch!

Hey!

Ay Papi, you're out.

I can't believe it, I missed you
so much.

You know I wasn't gonna be
able to stop her from coming.

Man, now I know I'm blessed.

Two of my favorite people in
the world on the day I get out.

And you've got a new ride.

No shit.

Real shit, bruh.

Damn, let's get the fuck out
of here.

Let's go.

You free now.

["Heat Up"]

So where you wanna go
first, your mom's, Roberto,

Fat Tony or some thots?

My moms.

Who poppin' in the streets now?

This cat, Kazami, popped up
out of nowhere on Springfield

after you got locked up
and started housing shit.

["Rockstar"]

[gun firing]

["Rockstar"]

[gun firing]

You making this motherfucker
sound like a super hero

or some shit.

For real, within a year
Kazami took over Newark,

Elizabeth, Linden and East
Orange,

shit most of Jersey City
honestly.

People thought dude was Haitian,
but he's really Nigerian,

brought a whole crew with him

that's used to guerrilla
warfare out in Africa.

["Paradise"]

Fat Tony just let him do it?

I mean, Frank Sorbonno
moved up in the family,

put a couple hits out on
Kazami, missed twice, pathetic.

That shit only gave
Kazami more street cred.

Frank got Monte Carlo on him
now.

Wait, you talking about that
Italian cat

that be in the old Monte Carlo?

Yep.

No wonder they can't get
Kazami,

Monte Carlo is shit for brains.

Only reason he ain't been tipped
over

is 'cause of police protection.

So what are you doing?

stuck.

I've known you forever
and it's always been us.

Rock and Zoom my people
and Shock rest in peace

but without you here on point,
man,

it's like I ain't been
able to get no traction.

["UMI Says"]

[Dutch knocking]

[Dutch knocking]

Hey, Ma.

When did you get home?

Today, just now.

["Ain't No Way"]

So you moved, huh?

Yeah.

What did you do with all
the stuff I bought you?

You bought?

Ma, listen, I know I messed up

and I know you're probably
mad at me, but you could have

at least came and seen
me once or wrote back.

I wrote you every week
and you just up and move?

Well, that's 'cause you a
goddamn fool

and you're a goddamn coward.

And yeah, I was mad
not for what you did do

but for what you didn't do.

You let them lock you
up like you was a dog.

And you expect me to write you.

You must be crazy, boy.

What I got to say you
don't want me to write.

You let them take you away from
me.

And you didn't do nothing about
it.

And yeah, all that shit
that you bought me,

I left it where it was.

I let it rot, I left it.

All that bullshit you
traded your freedom in for,

you think I want that?

You think that's what I want?

You think I wanna keep that?

["Ain't No Way"]

I ain't going back.

You damn right you're not
going back.

I'll kill you myself.

I'll kill you myself.

Get off of me, get off of me.

You go get what them people took
from you.

Go back and get what the
people took from you.

Bernard.

Your mother seems like
a special type of woman.

Imagine being raised by her.

At some point in the near
future,

we're gonna finish this
conversation.

I could offer you protection.


Look, I didn't know they
were gonna come after you

to get to me.

You're doing a great job,
you can't lose your cool now.

I win 98% of my cases,

run a six-minute mile with a
.45.

The last thing I'm gonna
do is lose my cool.

Good night, Mr. James.

[dramatic music]

[dramatic music]

[elevator dinging]

Fuck you, Monte Carlo.

[guns firing]

[dramatic music]

Boy, Qwan wanna holla at you.

What fat boy want?


All right.


[dramatic music]

What up?

Hey, I appreciate everything
you done for me, Dutch,

but I be waking up sweating
tears.

I can't tell the
difference between the two.

And it's so many people out
here dying, it's too many.

I be thinking somebody gonna
kill me

or my mom or my sister.

Don't you ever have thoughts
like that?

No.

Well, I do, man, I think about
it a lot.

I couldn't live with
myself if I did something

that would cause pain to my
family.

It ain't in me no more, Dutch,
it ain't.

If I said it was, I'd be
frontin'.

Ain't no future in that.

I know, man, so yo,
I'm moving out to L.A.

I'm gonna stay with my aunt.

[soft music]

I told you he wasn't
built for this shit.

He knows too much, way too much.

We shouldn't have let
him walk out of here.

Let me take care of that.

What he gonna do?

Nothing but go to California

and become some preacher or some
shit.

Let him go.

Shit, if that's what he
wanna do, all glory to God.

[soft music]

Do you solemnly swear

that the evidence you're
presenting today is the truth,

the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

I do.

You may have a seat.

State your name for the court.

Reverend Eqwan Taylor.

you currently residing?

In Los Angeles, California.

I'm the reverend of First
Street Baptist Church.

live prior to California?

Right here in Newark.

And were you ever connected

to the defendant, Bernard James?

Yes.
How so?

We were friends.

In fact, isn't it true

that you and Bernard James
were in prison together

for grand larceny?

Yes, sir.

Have you ever heard of
a man name Azugol Kazami?

Yes.

How so?

Bernard and I had
discussed killing Kazami.

Objection, your honor, Mr.
James has never been charged

with the murder of Azugol
Kazami.

A point I'm sure you'll make
clear

in your cross, counselor,
overruled.

So Reverend, in your best
ability,

can you share with us
the conversation you had

regarding the murder of Azugol
Kazami?

Look, what I'm about to put
y'all up on

ain't like shit we ever did
before.

So if y'all ain't bout
it, y'all can bounce.

Man, why you talking
to us like that, Dutch?

You know we down.

Oh yeah?

I'm taking over the drug trade
in Newark.

What the fuck, Dutch?

What you gonna do, compete with
Kazami?

Nah.

We kill Kazami.

Kill Kazami?

I ain't saying you
wrong or nothing, Dutch,

but killing dude, he'd murc us

if he thought we was
thinking about sticking him,

let alone killing him.

We don't know where he
lives or how to get to him.

He's married and got a kid.

Boom, that's how we get to
him.

What, we gonna kidnap
his girl and his kid?

You wanna snatch her?

She know what she signed
up for when she got with him,

but nah, Kazami ain't breaking
his neck over no bitch.

We get her to set him up.

She ain't gonna turn on her
meal ticket.

Sugar Ray will flip her.

That wannabe pimp
motherfucker?

Yeah, Sugar Ray ain't going
for that.

Sugar Ray like money
just like anybody else.

He'll do it for the paper.

Reverend Taylor, Reverend
Taylor, are you all right?

Yes, I'm good, I'm okay.

You need a break?

Yeah, I think I need a moment.

Your honor, short break for my
witness.

for a 30 minute recess.

[gavel banging]

["Rockstar"]

What were we talking about?

Kazami.

Right, right, the African.


I don't know about that, man.

It may be too hard.

Come on, man, anybody could
get got.

Yeah, that shit go both ways.

Didn't Kazami get two
hits put out on him?

They missed twice.

What the fuck make you
think we can get him?

Well, that's why we need you,
Sugar Ray.

His broad's the weak link.

They always are.

If anybody can bag him, it's
you.

Now, shit, the mob might miss
twice,

but everybody know Sugar Ray
don't.

You trying to gas me up.

Of course, Sugar, I'm the Sugar
Man, of course I don't miss.

[Sugar Ray laughs]

That's to show you we real
about this.

And if you go at Simone and
miss, my word,

my car is yours.

The beamer in front?

Yep.

See, Kazami, he can give
a bitch everything she want

except that understanding.

That's when the Sugar Man come
into play,

you know what I'm saying?

See, I'm the shelter to a bitch
storm.

Gotta create the storm.

The storm?

Like some emotional shit

that Kazami can't buy himself
out of.

Like what?

I don't know, like kill
his bitch daddy or something.

Shit.

We'll be in touch, Sugar Ray.

[soft music]

Be creative.

Ay, you got some panties on?

So Sugar Ray suggested it,

even though he wasn't
serious about you doing it?

Objection, the district
attorney can't possibly expect

the witness to know what
Sugar Ray was thinking.


Reverend Taylor, do you
think Sugar Ray was serious?

Nah.

Do you think the defendant
thought Sugar Ray was serious?

Yes.


[soft music]

You sure you got this?

I got my killer fit on, I'm
ready.

You know I can do this for
you.

I'm gonna show Dutch, man, I
got this.

All right, let's get it.

The murder of Mr. Smith
not only served as a message

to Kazami but to the rest of the
crew.

[Eqwan knocking]

[gun firing]

[woman crying]

No!

[dramatic music]

The stronger message
was that he was willing

to do anything to get
what he wanted, anything

and just like Sugar Ray
said, Simone fell apart.

[Sugar Ray] Whoa, slow down,
slow down.

You don't know what it's like,
Ray.

I do know how it is to be with
a man

that don't protect you from your
enemies.

You know he's using all the
time.

We got a child in the house.

Baby, that's just to cure his
soul

from the guilt he's consumed
with.

Let me tell you something,
his days of reckoning,

oh, they coming.

Yeah, but how long are
we gonna have to wait for?

Kazami makes my skin crawl
every time he touches me.

You know, I wouldn't be able to
see you

if he didn't let me come and
work out.

I can't take this no more.

Baby, I'm the Sugar
Man, that's why I'm here

to protect you, make sure
your financial resources

is all together for the rest of
your life

for you and your family,

but you gotta trust me,
you gotta believe me.

Can you do that for me?

I'll do anything you want,
Ray.

You just gotta help me with my
needs.

Oh, most definitely.

Ay, bring some champagne.

We celebrating over here, man.

I don't think you will
get an argument from anyone

if you decided to quit.

Or you can call a priest

and y'all can discuss your
future.

You do know regardless of what
we do,

there's no chance of us winning.

It's problematic for me

when my client sides with the
prosecution.

I make no excuses for who I
am.

We covet what we see first.

Where I grew up,

being a drug dealer's
how you make your money.

You get one time to be big time.

Great argument, but
it's not gonna stop you

from getting the lethal
injection.

[dramatic music]

I wanna talk to you about the
deal.

Y'all needed me to crack a
bitch.

You know me, I crack five
bitches

like I crack five knuckles,

you know what I'm saying and
ball my fist.

So it's only right,
50/50 split, 50/50 deal.

I hear what you saying.

I mean, we did call you.

So I'm cool with a 50/50
split under one condition.

Conditions?

You come with us.

I mean, 'cause we could look and
come back

and tell you anything.

Now, if you feel shitted on,

that could ruin a beautiful
partnership.

I ain't got a problem with
that.

So can we get to business?

I got two one-way tickets to
Miami.

She wants to go together
after all this shit go down.

You know what I mean, but you
know me.

I roll alone.

Now, Kazami, if he don't trust
the bitch,

what the fuck I look
like trusting the bitch?

You know what I'm saying?

So I feel like her and Kazambi
should go

on the trip together without me.

Far as the crib, he don't
really keep no real money

in there, you know what I mean?

I mean, she's sprung but he
ain't no fool.

You know what I mean?

He got two trap houses, one
in Newark, one in Elizabeth.

Oh, we got that covered.

The main house in
Roselle, high security,

500 thou on them, Simone
gonna have that packed

in the kitchen waiting for us.

You know what I'm saying?

We gonna go as satellite
repairmen.

Only problem is we can't bring
our straps.

But Simone will have
two guns waiting for us.

So we're going in unarmed,

depending on some chick to gun
us.

I ain't feeling that.

It's the only way, you
know what I'm saying?

You think I wanna go in
there without my heat?

It works for me as long
as that kid ain't there.

Nothing to it, I swear
to God, I'll make her take

that little bastard to her
grandparents.

So we good, let's get it done.

["Drama"]

We're here to repair the
satellite.

It's inside, but I
gotta check you first.

Shit, now we committing a
crime?

["Drama"]

Can I get my tools?

["Drama"]

Hi, I'm Simone.

Nice to meet you.

Do you think you could show us

where your primary box is,
please?

Yeah, right this way.

["Drama"]

Who the fuck is this?

They're here to fix the
satellite

and you said you weren't
doing that anymore.

What's the point of
sending a boat to your mom

if I can't enjoy myself?

It's cool, I fixed them
already.

["Drama"]

Right this way.

Hey!

Wanna ball?

We working, man.

["Drama"]

[suspenseful music]

[dramatic music]

You ready?

Let's do it.

[explosive exploding]

[dramatic music]

["Paradise"]

Babe, do you have a minute?

Please, please.

Come on, you never dance with
me.

["Paradise"]

It's clear.

[dramatic music]

["Paradise"]

Yo, yo, yo, drop the fucking
gun.

Son of a!

Put it on the table.

Now face the fucking wall on
your knees.

We gonna keep this real simple.

We here for the money.

Now, if it's where it's
supposed to be at, we good.

If it ain't, I'm blowing
her fucking brains out.

[dramatic music]

[phone vibrating]

I got the baby, bro, let's get
it.


[dramatic music]

Are we good?

Yeah, damn right, we good.

Told you.


It's over.

I have no further questions.

Nichols.

I should cross examine him.

Yeah.

Defense has no questions, your
honor.

Hey, Craze [foreign
language], what is it with you?

Why the stone face?

[foreign language]

Shh.

You did have a problem with
Kazami,

but you ain't got that problem
no more.

[Fat Tony] What?

[Fat Tony yelps]
Whoa.

Now I know why they call you
Craze.

What are you a fucking
psycho walking around

with this fucking head in this
bag?

Your man, Lil Frankie right
here,

yeah, he couldn't finish the
job.

So we did it as a favor.

Roberto, what is it
with these fucking kids?

Here, here, get rid of this
shit.

Get rid of that, just
get it out of here.

I gotta admit, though, you
know what?

This fucking Kazami's been a
thorn in my side for years.

You got a guy we've been
trying real hard to get.

So for that, I guess we owe you
a favor

and I think I know what that
favor is.

I think you guys wanna take
over the drug trade, right?

And you need us to
provide police protection,

so you could be bosses.

Is that the long and the short
of it?

And you got yourself a friend,
believe me,

as long as you live.

Smile, will you?

You want me to call Detective
O'Neal?

That's a good idea,

tell him they're with us now,
all right.

Come on, let's go munch.

Whoa, whoa, I got something to
say.

I'd take a bullet for the
both of yous right now,

you know that.

I don't trust these mulignans.

They're animals, they speak a
language

I don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

And that head in a duffel bag,

it's gonna come back
to bite us in the ass.

And let me tell you something
right now.

I'm going on record with you,
Tony, I am not taking a fall

for these fucking niggers.

And I'll wack the both of them
right now, it's what I do.

Do I fucking stutter when I
talk, heh?

Did you not just hear me?

Did you not hear me give him my
word,

you know what my fucking word
is?

But what is it with you, heh?

Smarten up, all right, stop
being so fucking color blind.

Change with the times.

I know where we can get
some good veal and peppers.

Oh, look at this, what is
this Mount Everest here?

Jesus Christ.

Holy shit!

Who hired this kid?

["Let's Get It On"]

We should take a vote,
you know, to gauge things.

That's against the rules.

Yeah, but save a lot of time

once you get into deliberation.

I'm sorry this process
is inconveniencing you,

but we haven't heard everything
yet.

I've heard enough, that boy is
guilty.

Don't y'all feel the same?

Anybody don't feel the way
Henry does?

Don't get me wrong, I think
he's guilty

of a lot of things, just not
what he's being charged with.

I like his lawyer, I wanna
hear what she has to say.

["Let's Get It On"]

["She Wildin'"]

Yay!

There she go.

Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

["She Wildin'"]

What's up, birthday girl?

Look at the birthday girl.

Hi.

Go ahead, make a wish.

[party applauding]

These are Angel's Charlies.

They're down for whatever.

Oh yeah, let's get down to the
whatever.

Wait, wait, wait, glasses,
glasses.

For sure.

Everyone, now look, in the
seven years I've been released

from prison, we've been more
successful

than most motherfuckers do in a
lifetime.

Now, I'm not just talking
about the street oglers.

The entertainment, the
fashion, the restaurants,

like this one here, Mr.
Cerrone's blessed me with.

Angel has been instrumental in
all of it.

Now, this is Angel's night,

but none of this could've
happened without all of you.

You're my brothers, you're my
sister

and I owe all you motherfuckers.

Family.
Family.

Now let's get to the
everything.

Come on, Dutch, let's take a
picture.

Oh, you know I don't
like being in no pictures.

Come on, just one.

Come on, I'll take it.

Come on, Dutch.

Ay, how was that party?

Fire.

It was lit.

Lit, Angel brought
out all the bad bitches.



Man, the traffic on
the highway was so bad,

I ain't going up to Bmore no
time soon.

Shut yo ass up, if it
wasn't for them crab cakes

you ordered, we would've
been there on time.


Man, I wasn't the only
one eating crab cakes.

You had crab cakes, too.

You know she expect the
whole family to be there.

She gonna kick your ass.

Hey, fellas, what's happening?

Where's Dutch?

Roc, let me talk to you.

You know what one of
the most dangerous parts

of our business is?

It's not aiming too high that
you miss it,

it's aiming too low that you
reach it.

Buona fortuna, lots of good
fortune.

I wanna make you rich.

I want you to come with me
and be part of my family.

Dutch, he's nothing
without me, he's washed up.

What, Dutch, that's my
brother.

We been down for life.

Loyalty, you feel me?

Loyalty, I love that.

I just hope that Dutch cares
about your little clique

just as much as you do.

Do you feel me?

[dramatic music]

Think about it.

I don't trust them Italians.

Dutch think Frank had something
to do with that stolen car

that y'all got locked up in.

I know what Dutch think,

but I don't think they
had nothing to do with it.

But Dutch is always on point,
so...

Fake ass Tony Montana
Italians.

[crew laughing]

That nigga said Tony Montana.

At this juncture, the
prosecutor has painted

an incredibly unflattering
picture of you to the jury.

Now mind you, it has
nothing to do with the case

and I'll cover it in my closing,

but we have to put on a
defense and we'd be idiots

to think that we can unring that
bell.

And we not idiots?

I go out of my way not
to look like an idiot.

So it would be good for you
to have someone speak well

on your behalf.

If not, change the perception
that Jacobs has presented

but at least question it.

Right.

Is there anyone that can
say good things about you?

Dozens, but they're all dead
or in jail.

That's not good.

No childhood friends, impartial
third parties, girlfriends?

No.

other of any kind?

In my lifetime, Ms. Nichols,
I've had my share of women,

but no, I've never been in a
relationship.

No?
[Dutch] No.

Jacobs won't be done with
putting on his witnesses

until the middle of next
week, so give it some thought.

Thank you.

Sure, I'll see you tomorrow.

Yeah.

Dutch, hey, come on over here.

Ladies, this is the owner.

Hi.
Hey.

Give us a minute.

Have a seat.

I love what you did to this
place.

Thanks.

But I have been hearing some
rumblings.

Yeah, what sort of rumblings?

Frank thinks that the
restaurant should be given

to someone in the family.

Well, I'm like family with Mr.
Cerrone.

So Frank could go see him
if he has a problem with it.

I don't have a horse in this
race.

I just wish you should
give me a little something.

Yeah, yeah, I'll cop
you a bottle of champagne.

What kind you drink?

That's not what I'm talking
about.

You know what I'm talking about.

Give me a little info
on one of your rivals,

it'll make me look good.

Yeah, well I don't snitch
on anyone, anywhere, anytime

or under any circumstance.

You might wanna rethink that.

Just did, the answer's still
no.

You take care.

["Again"]

Y'all went, what?

I got one and a pimp.

Hello, nuh-uh, Tamika, no,
no not today, okay, girl.

I have money on this game.

And you over there eye
fucking dude, Tamika.

I'll be right back.

There she go.

Come on, Nina, you gonna pay or
play?

I ain't got all day.

How am I gonna play?

I mean, you see my partner ran
off hoeing.

I could play.

Come again?

I can play until your
partner comes back.

What's up, boss?

Sure, if he's forfeiting.

So I got five and a possible.

What you got?

I'm sorry, excuse me?

How many do you have?

Oh, yeah, I got two.

Put us down for eight.

somebody's feeling lucky.

Thank you, nice doing business
with you.

Seriously?

Didn't you just see me play all
hearts?

I thought you said you could
play.

My fault.

It's been fun, but I have to
go.

Stop, come on, Nina.

Yo, how much she lose?

500.

I don't know where he is.

I don't wanna fucking wait.

What are we, a couple
of jerk offs over here

waiting for...
There he is.

Hey, it's the fucking Ly
brothers, Hugly and Ugly.

Ha-ha, funny, come on, let's
go.

I went to see Dutch like you
sent me.

Yeah, he hands me a bag of
money.

I said, what's this?

He says it's a start.

A start, I say.

Let me tell you something, you
stupid black son of a bitch,

you know what your problem is?

You took what another man
earned.

You tried to build your
foundation

on another man's reputation.

I told them this, you forgot
the one thing in our business.

You live and die on you and you
alone.

I mean, sure I know he's
crazy, a little more ruthless,

he had to be, I'll give him
that, okay.

But he plays by his own rules.

He doesn't play by our rules.

He pisses me off.

So then I told him, now
I got you by the balls.

And I'm gonna keep squeezing and
squeezing

until I get fucking blood.

And then I'm gonna crush you

like the piss ass nigger that
you are.

And he just stands there, he
looks at me,

he doesn't say anything, he's a
chump.



What is your fucking problem,
huh?

Those guys make us a ton of
fucking dough, all right.

Nobody's gonna connect them
to us, so just re-fucking-lax

and forget about it.

It's a lot of fucking money
and it goes in my pocket.

What's your fucking problem,
huh?

What the fuck is your problem?

problem!

Fuck you!
All right, all right.

[foreign language], all right.

That's it, finito, all right.

If this keeps up, we're gonna
sit down

with the old man, all right.

You're gonna get slapped on the
wrist, maybe more than that,

all right, Frank?

You ain't going to see
him again, all right.

You don't deal with them anymore

because I can't fucking trust
you.

Hey, I'm talking to
you all right, capiche?

[foreign language], enough,
now come on, let's go.

You're gonna fuck this up for
us!

All right, stop, stop!

Stop, [foreign language]

I'm not riding with him.

I'll ride in my own car, fuck
it.

Hey, Roc, ain't Aisha supposed
to be having the baby soon?

Yeah, any day.

Ay, ain't that about your
fourth, fifth baby with Aisha?

You need to get your tubes tied.

Shut up, nigga.


Hi, where's Dutch?

I got somebody who wants to talk
to him.

Who?

William Brent.

And who the fuck is that?

Bill Blass.

What he want?

Trabajo?

All right, fuck it, send him
in.

Yo!

Oh, there he is.

What's up, Bill, go on have a
seat.

What's going on, man?

Hey, guys, I really hate that
I'm here

but my family and I are really
down on our luck right now.

And I'm just looking for
any type of work right now

if you have any.

All right, what you think,
Roc?

Give us a minute.

All right.

Who he fuck with?

Joe from Newark.

He on the run from the feds.

Man, fuck it.

Just have him take Bliss' spot.

Yeah.

move, let's make it happen.

Let's make it happen, let's
move.

All right.
All right.

On another note, nigga, is you
sterile?

'Cause you ain't got no kids.


wanted to see me, sir.

Nina, come in.

I wanted to introduce
you to our new client

I was telling you about, Mr.
James.

Mr. James.

You can call me Bernard.

[phone ringing]

I'm sorry, I've gotta take
this.

You guys keep talking, I'll be
right back.

I thought your name was Dutch.

Nickname.

get Dutch from Bernard?

It's a long story.

So the Cerrone Social Club is
one

of the six restaurants that you
own?

No, but I manage it for a
friend.

You're not exactly the person
you pretend to be, are you?

Look, I said I could play
cards

till your friend came back.

I didn't say I was good at it.


One, two, head body, head
body, there you go, come on.

Come on, come on.

Body, body.

There you go, hit it, hit it...

Don't listen to him, he don't
know shit.

Oh, Tony, veni ca.

[Fat Tony] Hey.

Kid looks good.

[Fat Tony] He does, you'll
fuck that up.

I trained him myself.

I could see that.

Thank you for coming
down here to sit with me.

No problem, for reasons
passed understanding,

I'm out picking up a few
things for the old lady

tomorrow being our wedding
anniversary.

Buona fortuna, did your wife
get the flowers I sent her?

Yes, by the way, that was
an incredibly nice gesture.

You made me look bad, you fuck.

[foreign language]

I didn't think it was
appropriate

to talk to you about this over
the phone.

What are we talking about?

I'm talking about our
street holdings here.

Dutch?

Yeah, Dutch.

Come on, we all know these
people are inferior to us.

Things ain't being ran right.

No, no, things are being
ran very fucking right

from where I'm sitting.

And the reason I know this
is my accountant told me so.

And just so there's no
more fucking confusion

about where I'm sitting on this,

the next time you wanna get
ahold of me,

you call me on a fucking phone.

[foreign language]

[foreign language]

You mean you're gonna take the
side

of that bottom feeding
nigger over one of your own?

[dramatic music]

[Tony choking]

Nice work, Lou.

That's it, head body, head body.

Come on, keep up that footwork.

You come here a lot?

A few times, a lot of doctors,

lawyers and financial analysts
come here.

I get it, rich people like
to hang with rich people.

Well, I ain't gonna lie.

I enjoy the harvest of my labor.

But to be honest, all this is a
result

of wanting it for someone else.

Okay, I'm confused.

My father walked out of my
mom's life before I was born.

She went hungry many a day
to feed and provide for me.

So I promised myself when I
got old enough that if able

I would give her everything
that my father should have.

So it's not a holiday, birthday
or any day that goes by

where I don't try to give her
the best

that life has to offer.

Well, your mother is very
fortunate

because I don't think
there's a woman alive

that wouldn't wish for
that quality in a man.

Well, I'm not trying to
win an award or nothing.

You sure are easy to talk to.

So are you.

["Mandarin Hotel"]

You have the lawyers for
Martin and Kendall at noon.

That meeting's gonna run long,

so will you order us something
to eat?

Sure, what do you feel like?

Whatever you had yesterday is
fine.

Can we try something
different?

I had lasagna, you had
spaghetti.

I had a bad experience with
it.

Why?

Well, they delivered the
meatballs

but they forget the
spaghetti and the sauce.

They clearly have zero
compassion

for young starving assistants.

They took care of it, right?

Yeah, but I was hungry.

By the time they brought the
spaghetti,

I had already eaten the
meatballs.

That must've sucked.

Tell me about it.

Okay, well we won't
be ordering from them.

Hey.

Hi.

I forgot to tell you, Mr.
James is here.

What stopped you?

The meatballs.

Thank you, Sam.

I'm sorry.

Why, did you do something
wrong?

I didn't call you, but
by no means does that

reflect the time that we spent
together.

It was incredible.

Yeah, it was.

Excuse me.

Nina, what are you trying to
tell me

that you're not telling me?

I liked you from the moment I
met you,

but I can't do this.

I spoke with Tamika and
she let me know what you do

beyond the restaurants and
stores.

When I told you my brother died,

he was murdered by a drug
dealer.

So you think I'm gonna end up
like him

and you gonna lose me, too.

You're far too smart to get
caught up

the way my brother did.

It's about respect, respect
for his life, his memory.

I can't see myself living
off what he died for.

I can respect that.

And I probably shouldn't say
this,

but I'm gonna say it anyway.

You will never ever get over me.

I was meant for you and
you were meant for me.

How do you know that?

Nobody knows that much.

I know 'cause I know what love
is.

[organ music]

Mrs. Cerrone, this is Bernard
James, a business associate

and very good friend of your
husband's.

[organ music]

Rose, Tony was like a
brother to me, I'm so sorry.

Whatever you need.

[organ music]

Reach out to Detective O'Neal.

I want this boy put to
bed as soon as possible.

[foreign language]

Bill Blass, you was just gonna
leave

without saying goodbye,
after we gave you a job?

Ow, fuck!

Look, guys, it's not what you
think it is.


No.

What is it?

You guys saw how shit was
going down.

I was gonna give the money
back, I was only holding onto it

in case there was a raid
or shit got complicated.

It's true.

[Craze laughing]
[phone ringing]

Yeah.

Come on, guys, you gotta
believe me.

Man, shut up.

Hold on.

Yo.

All right.

Ay, y'all let Dutch
know whatever he needs,

whatever it is, I got him,
whatever.

Yeah, I know, Dutch told us.

He got a job for you.

Only you can do it, Bill.

Well, can I at least get
dressed first?

Of course, Dutch has a
special outfit for you.

Like I said, anything for
Dutch.

What the fuck is that?

It's an option vest.

You got two options.

Either you put this vest
on that Dutch made for you

and you take some people
out along with yourself.

Option two, we kill your whole
family.

What the fuck you wanna do?

Your wife, your daughter,
your mother, your dad,

your grandfather, your cousin

and bubblefuck, we killing
everybody.

Fuck, I think I just pissed
myself.

Fine, I'll fucking do it.

I'll put the fucking vest on.

I thought you might
say that, wise choice.

Yo, that nigga Roc is
really having another baby.

Man, didn't Aisha say it
wasn't gonna be no nother one?

Ha, Roc's a little bitch.

[dramatic music]

Secure all the exits,
we're going upstairs.

Move!

[dramatic music]

Yeah, yeah bro, it's a boy.

Big boy.

Rahmin Abdul, also known
as Roc, you're under arrest.

It's over.

You have the right to remain
silent.


[Officer] Let's go.
[Roc] I just had a baby.

right...

What the fuck?

Fuck he smiling at?

[dramatic music]

What they call it when you don't
wanna have the baby no more

and you get your nuts clipped?

The snip, that's a vasectomy.

Vasectomy?

Yeah...
[sirens wailing]

[dramatic music]

Come on!

[dramatic music]

[guns firing]

[dramatic music]

Get a couple bottles to
table 12, no sparklies, though.

Keep it low key.

["Heat Up"]

Dutch, bruh, Zoom is dead.

and they got Angel on lockdown,
the feds.

Roc and Angel ain't gonna
flip.

[dramatic music]

Detective, you claim that
Mr. Bernard James is the cause

for your early retirement.

Yes, he ordered that the
27th Precinct be blown up.

He sent a psycho into the
station strapped with C4.

He blew himself up and my fellow
officers.

Objections, your honor, calls
for facts not in evidence.

Overruled.

Exception.


Now, Mr. O'Neal, how can you
be sure

that Mr. Bernard James
was indeed responsible

for that explosion?

The suicide bomber's
name was William Brent.

He also went by Bill Blass.

He was a small-time hustler.

He sent his wife a letter the
morning

before he entered the building.

Is this the letter?

Objection.

Counsel, get up here now.

[dramatic music]

I'm very surprised.

The defense has never received
a copy of this letter.

Your honor, we received this
this morning by the witness.

You knew he'd be introducing
this letter

as your witness prep.

I'll allow it.

He has a duty to turn over all
evidence.


Your honor.

Counsel, I made my
ruling, step back now.

[dramatic music]

Dear Monique, by the time
you get this, I'll be dead,

but I wanted you to know
that it's because of Dutch.

He said if I don't do what
he says, he's gonna kill you,

the kids and my whole family.

So this is my sacrifice.

I gladly make it, too.

When you get this, deliver
it to the authorities,

the DA or someone like that.

Don't give it to no regular cop,
though.

I love you, pray for my soul.

Love always, Billy.

[dramatic music]

[building exploding]

Hey, Michelle.

You're blessed.

Your best was good but it
wasn't good enough, accept it.

The trial isn't over,
you haven't won yet.

I'll do you a favor,

I'll take the death penalty off
the table.

That's your offer?

Look, I don't wanna
see your client executed.

I prefer to watch him rot in
prison for the rest of his life

as a gleaming example for
those who break the law

on my watch.

You mean as an example
for financial donors

in your bid for governor.

[dramatic music]

I'll even let you choose the
prison

where he serves out his life
sentence.

You haven't met the
elements, I can still win this.

If not now, then on appeal.

Unless you become a magician,

we all know what's gonna happen.

You have until before
closing arguments tomorrow,

take that to your client.

We'll take the next one.

["Again"]

The jury is split.

I've been advocating strongly
on behalf of Mr. James.

So when I flip against him,
everyone else will follow.

He's toast.

["Again"]

I asked my judge, Dutch
will never see daylight,

I promise you that.

Nobody fucks with me.

[light music]

You know you're a
very sexy woman, right?

If I didn't, I would be an
idiot.

You'll go out your
way not to be an idiot.

Are you getting enough to eat?

I was on a diet.


I was waiting for you to stop
by

to see if you wanted to
get in a pickup game.

You like doing that, don't
you?

Doing what?

Pretending things are
worse than what they are.

Oh, I ain't gotta pretend.

I'll spend a couple of years
in here and then be executed.

The judge and the jury are
already bought and paid for.

Can you prove that?

No, but you'll know
I'm telling the truth

because the man that
bought and paid for it

will be in court tomorrow.

He ain't gonna miss the
opportunity to see me burn.

Then why are they offering
to take the death penalty

off the table and get
you to choose the prison?

That's to torture me first.

It's still a death sentence.

It's a discreet phone call

from one prison official to
another.

Suddenly, a Newark drug
dealer is found dead

in his cell from suicide.

Nobody'll question it.

I'll question it.

It doesn't matter.

It'll be like the Freddie Gray
case

and countless others before me.

Nobody'll be convicted.

If you felt that way,
why did you hire me?

Here Comes the Sun.

Nina Simone song?

Somebody told me once

that song promised a better
tomorrow.

I'm not done yet.

[dramatic music]

You're watching Wake Up New
Jersey.

I'm David Greenwood.

Today, we're keeping a very
close eye

on what could only be described
as the most important trial

in the history of Newark.

District attorney Anthony Jacobs

and defense attorney Michelle
Nichols

are about to begin their closing
remarks

in the trial of Bernard James.

This is all happening today
and I can tell you guys

from personal experience
that at most trials,

it all hinges on these closing
arguments by the attorneys.

However, the defense attorney
appears to be playing

by the New Jersey Nets rule,

as in they've already lost the
game

but they're still on the court.

Stay with us as we follow
this developing story

as it all unfolds.

[dramatic music]

[dramatic music]

All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

[light music]

You may be seated.

Bring in the jury.

[dramatic music]

Are you prepared to proceed

with your closing statements,
counselors?

Yes, your honor, I am.

Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, you have just sat

through three weeks of the
biggest

and baddest gangster movie ever
performed.

It was better than the
Godfather, better than Casino.

It reminded me of Scarface
and just as fictitious.

It was written, directed and
produced by your very own

district attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

He deserves an Oscar.

[Michelle clapping]

But this isn't Hollywood,
ladies and gentlemen.

There's a man's life at stake.

And in these past few
weeks, not a single fact

has been presented by
Attorney Jacobs, not one.

He has merely presented
circumstantial evidence

held together by the
weak glue of assumption.

Assumption of crooked cops,
gangsters turned ministers,

five and dime hustlers and
not one law abiding citizen

in the bunch, not one.

He brings waywardness and the
faith of truth and glorifies

every word that comes out of
his mouth as to lure you away

from what's real, what's true.

And the witnesses he produced
certainly

aren't credible enough
to hang a man's life on.

The district attorney

has not proven Mr. James
committed any crimes.

What crimes did he commit?

I still don't know.

And it's supposed to be up
to you to find out based

on the evidence supplied by the
state?

I don't think so.

I don't think the jury
should confuse itself

with the manuscripts
attorney Jacobs presented

with the real facts of this
case.

If you do that, then you will
only see

that Mr. James is
innocent of these crimes.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, I
wanna thank you for your time

and your patience throughout
these past few weeks.

As I said in the beginning, I
mean, we could be doing a lot

of other things but it was our
duty

to ourselves and to each other.

These past few weeks, we've been
submerged

in the murky waters of
Bernard James' life,

his disregard for life, law
and order and the property

of others from his youth,
stealing cars to the present.

His existence has been
filled with bloodshed,

murder, innocent victims
and shattered lives.

Now, we must do for Simone
Greenwood, her mother and father

what they are not here to do
today.

And Detective O'Neal
from the 27th Precinct,

the survivors and their
families.

Your duty is to them now.

Your duty is to honor each and
every life

that Bernard James has
taken because if you don't,

the lives that he takes in the
future

will be blood on your hands.

Let's hope and pray that
the next victim isn't you

or you, your brother, your
sister, your mom, your dad,

your husband, your wife

or your children.

If you we do not find justice

and find the defendant
Bernard James guilty today,

then each and every one of you

will leave this courtroom today

as guilty as this man right
here.

[dramatic music]

Thank you, Attorney Jacobs.

["Ask For Help"]

[guns firing]

["Ask For Help"]

[guns firing]

["Ask For Help"]

Michelle Nichols, I saw you on
TV.

You did an amazing job.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

["Rockstar"]

Hey, check it out, king.

Ay, you work in that courthouse,
huh?

Yeah, bruh.

Yeah, I got an
opportunity of a lifetime.

["Rockstar"]

You'll get the other
100 when the job's done.
