already know in order to debate

ancient and ardent
question: does God exist?

There is perhaps no more contentious
issue that we could consider.

[different narrator] Agnostic
astronomer Robert Jestrell said

[loud gong rings] ...astronomers
now find themselves in a corner

because they have proven by their own
methods that the world became abruptly and

and at which you can
trace the seeds of every star

every planet, every living thing
on... in this cosmos and on earth.

And they have found
all this has happened

as a product of forces they
did not hope to discover.

he says no persuasive argument

for the existence of god has
ever been advanced or produced

without convincing [gong]

no argument in favor stands has
been proven without a doubt, [gong]

or to stand the testimony...

[from the back ground]
Nothing... There was no god...

there was no vacuum

there was no twirling mathematical...
[speech drowned by a gong]

doctor Jestrell
has said from Oxford.

There was nothing.

[another narrator] There
is no explanation [gong]

for the origins of our species,
for the origins of our cosmos,

for the origins of own selves,
there is not one explanation left

which requires existence...
[gong and traffic noise]

Do you know that they keep on saying
that the human brain has the same elements?

Why are some carbon based molecules
conscientious and others are not?

If we are just molecules in motion,
how do we have human freedom?

William Cornwall from Cornell

He is a materialistic Darwinist, he points
out that we don't have any human freedom.

If all we are, is molecules
in motion. [religious chanting]

[different narrator] Of course Darwin used
creationist interviews, he actually says...

[unintelligible speech]

Einstein, he used god
imagines when he spoke...

Of the extraordinary
majesty... [loud music]

How could you even think
of giving such a lecture?

On basic principles of
quantum theory, that's how.

[suspenseful music]

[prayer drowned by music]

us in a very vulnerable position.


be a bit offensive to Monsignor Bastini.

My research will finally
provide the answer.

Will it, really?
Yes.

What are looking for, has
already been answered.

Really? What scientific
journal might I find that answer?

In the Holy Books.

[Noel] Far beyond your scientific journals.
[Jeanine] Again, the god bit.

Oh, slow down.

I thought you like
it, my god, you bet!

God, no! Nothing's up there guiding
us, or eternalizing, or protecting us.

Nothing, it's just us.

please! Mum, leave him alone!

going to convince the faithful,

when you can't even
convince your own family?

will soon realize this centuries old hoax.

All history is god's, but Roman, Greek and
Egyptian are on mythologies rubbish heap

and your god, your Christ, no?

Is this conversation necessary?

Listen to your music.

Your so called scientific proof.


self-existing dimension.

thing as self existed.

Everything has to
have a beginning!

An unimaginable explosion of a
self-existing gravitational dimension.

From the galaxies, planets,
dinosaurs, cockroaches, eventually us.

Out of nothing.


was, always will be.

distracting, I'll be late for the game.

You still have nothing to show
for your misguided research.

Ah, Misguided? Because
I use my own mind?

Exposing our daughter
to your atheistic absurdity!

One must find her own answers.

The only answer!
God.

The answer isn't god!

Really?

Then what about
your lecture tomorrow?

I would be careful
with that answer.

My student just might give you a not
so gentle shove through gates of hell

I will take hell if there was one,
to open their eyes to the truth.

No-oo

[tires screeching]

[crashing glass]

not gentle shove to the gates of hell

Closed my eyes to the truth.

[loud sounds]

It's not her dead husband?
Yeah

Yes, a self-existing gravitational
dimension of such complexity

that it avoided
detection, until now.

Hawking's research?

His, also my own.

Hawking's conclusion's
unproven nonsense.

[a student] Exactly,
what about Lennox?

Professor of advanced
mathematics at Oxford who called

Hawking's research something
out of Alice in Wonderland.


Oxford has been known to
produce a looser every now and then.

[the class] whoa!

Surely, it's all a matter
of one's perspective, isn't?

Absolutely not.

If it was matter of one's perspective,
there would be too many variables.

Truth, however, is truth. I'm sorry I don't
recognize you. Are you registered for my class?

I'm just auditing. Self-existence
and all that, is mind bugling

I'm actually majoring in Medieval
History. I'm signed to professor Algada.

Rinaldo.

Then you may audit.
Tell him I said 'hello'.

Now, where was I?

[a student] One truth
and only one. And it's God.

[the class] Yeah!

This is a class on
astro-physical science, isn't it?

So, let's get back to the realities
of astro-physics, shall we?

-God, Jesus Christ is our
reality, professor. [class] Yeah!

A lot of disagreements with your reality.
Disagreements which has lead to centuries of bloodshed.

I don't see any blood
shed in our class room.

Not yet. [class laughs]

How funny. Come to think about it, the
competition between science and religion is

sort of like 'track meet'.

[Jeanine] Why not? 1500 meter relay.

For team science we have Madam
Curie, Max Planck, Niels Bohr,

Albert Einstein,
Stephen Hawking,

Ah, Hawking's a cripple. That
guy can't even walk, let alone run.


Da Vinci, first name Leonardo,
substituting for Hawking.

God has his own relay team.

Exactly. He's been winning
the big ones for centuries.

[class] Yeah!
God's relay team, okay.

I happened to have taken a number
of courses on the history of Catholicism

as an undergraduate at
St. Catherine the Divine

Big tip on Papal infallibility, so let's give
God's advocates their best shot, shall we?

[Jeanine] A team of infallible popes.
[students] Ahh

Be careful, professor. This
is St. Genesius, remember.

Who can forget.

So a team of infallible popes.

At the start I'm leading
Alexander the sixth,

who enjoyed fornicating
with the sisters of Dorothy,

Next the baton goes to August of Damascus
the first, who forced nuns into prostitution.

Damascus then handed the
baton over to Benedict the ninth,

who enjoyed sodomizing animals.

And tearing up the tract we have nine
others, who... [students banging desks]

decorated his house with
sculptures of... [banging continues]

sodomizing young boys


[melancholy music]

[voice of Jeanine]
So here we go...

[chanting music]

in the back ground]

[suspenseful music]



I'm sorry

with science in never ending conflict.

It's you science that
created the conflict.

Wrong, Chandler, science is truth
but being plumped with a conflict

since you are a little babe, it's now hard
to accept the truth, the truth of science.

Our God, our Christ are myths?

Of course not. Our faith in
the resurrection of Jesus Christ

provides us with truth.
The truth of everlasting life.

Sorry dear students, but
everlasting life is not a reality.

It is nothing, but wishful dream
grounded in irrational fear of death.

Believe in God in the resurrection of his
son, Jesus Christ is not a wishful dream.

All protection for you Chandler

Before long your god will be in the
same mythological bed of quick sand

as Dina Ballantor and that
character with horns and fork tail.

Oh Gosh, all
mythology is rubbish.

How can you reconcile placing
God in mythology's rubbish heap?

Not believing in the after
life, after the accident.

[cars screeching]

As hard as it may be, on our
death, we become nothing.

Fertilizers for the earth, for
deciduous daisies and shrubs.

Lunches for beetles,


just fertilize our lunches.

Your focus of today's lecture

realities of our cosmos.

These are true realities,
I confront them dearly.

I'm sorry, monsignor,

Tell me,

Do you find it satisfying

To refuse godly principles
concerning the cosmos,

in the impressionable
minds of our youngsters,

I do what's required in my position as
a professor of astro-physical science,

but wouldn't you rather
discuss this in private?

I can dismiss my students.

Madam, St. Genesius stands as a
holy bastion of truth and openness.

Students, stay!

further assistance to you, Monsignor?

I will be reviewing one of the
university's most noted programs.

Yours, professor Markham.

undeserved compliment.

There are the foundations, whose generous
donations have fueled your research projects

Only upon the academic statue of St. Eugene's
enabled by your leadership, Monsignor.

We'll be a curious
servant of God.

I recently had my assistant checking
into the backgrounds of your supporters.

All such is filed on university's
grants and contracts office.

Yes, but I'm still involved in opening our
students minds to the eternal glory of God.

Sometimes the financial dealings
of the faculty just slip by me.

Had I known, I would have sent
all copies directly to your office.

Here we are, oh, a considerable
grant to you, Professor Markham.

From the National Free
Though Society for your research.

And I quote

'On the Determination of
the Natural Origins of Life. '

Natural origins.

That particular research was for
reaching conclusions on strength of theory.

So nothing to do for offering St. Genesius
adherence to the commandments of God?

I wouldn't put it that way.

Oh, no, oh well.

I am known to making a
mistake every now and then.

But here. Another grant
to our professor Markham.

We have a research into
ethical origins [laughs] now.

From the Jeffersonian
Humanist Foundation.

The Jeffersonian
is the most known...

That Jeffersonian designation,
would that like any chance refer

to former President
Thomas Jefferson?

I believe it does.

Yes, well. Remembering my early priestly studies
on satanic influences and world governments

wasn't Mr. Jefferson
the most notable atheist?

Or does my memory serve
me correctly, professor?

I should have refused the grant?

An open question,
you tell me, will you?

Silence!

Madam, if you please,
the benefit to our students

It funded various student research
projects and made appearance in.

But on another note, monsignor,
and I mean this most respectfully.

I would have appreciate if you
would refer to me as 'professor'

or if you prefer as 'doctor' upon
my PhD on astro-physical sciences.

I deeply appreciate the
omission of the word 'Madam'

What do you see as your
role here St. Genesius?

To give my students the basic
understanding of scientific principle.

And the purpose behind
the scientific principles?

To enable my students to thoroughly
analyze natural phenomenon.

Oh, the rationale of your teaching
acquired from your PhD days at Trinston

No, my undergraduate days
at St. Catherine the Divine.

St. Catherine is really the most elegant
institution for young Catholic women.

Particularly absorb what
St. Catherine had to offer.

I was able to absorb the advice
of someone you hold so highly,

And who might that be?

The author of Isaiah.
Chapter one, verse 18.

Come... let us reason
together, saith the Lord.

Though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow.

Here you find the connection of the
passage of Isaiah and your science.

Yes, the guiding
word was reason.

So was your interpretation of Isaiah's
reason to form blasphemous attacks

upon our Lord and son
Jesus Christ, oh yes, Madam.

Yes, you see Madam, unbeknownst to you,
I have been listening to your blasphemy.

Huh? It appalls me and it appalls
the institution you are employed by.

You are here to teach the value of
reason. The reason of Plato, Copernicus...

The reason put forth of Isaiah
was a command directly from God.

A command! To
think as he would think

So we may humbly serve before
him and find his divine guidance.

I am here to teach reason, logic,
all that is embodied in true science.

What about God? What
about his commands?

Your God is nothing but a fairy
tale. Fairy tale of non existing

God is not non-existent. And that is the
message to be delivered at St. Genesius.

And still is.

Monsignor, I am a scientist, that has
been honored with international reputation

astro-physics as my subject
matter is science, not hocus-bocus.

Our divine Lord, hocus-bocus!

You see, and I almost forgot. I'm having a
lecture here in Hankins on Thursday at 11 A.M.

You are more that welcome to attend. I will
try my best to concentrate on the scientific.

While skipping all
the hocus-pocus.

Madam,


[strong music]


Let us pray.

[voice of Bastini] Do not cast
away from your presence, oh God.

Do not cast away from
your presence, oh God, my...

[echoing prayer]

Nor take your Holy
Spirit from here...


And such as be seeded within
her by the forces of darkness

darkness...

[eerier music]

[angry shout]

Laura. You scared me.

get your attention these days.

research is so frustrating.

Is it worth it?

Yes. Yes, it is worth it.

Hey, hey, hey!

Sit

What?

Trying to prove there is no God?

People are calling
you a devil worshiper.

Some even say you
are the Antichrist.

What do you think?

I don't know what
to think anymore.

I'm so lonely. I need my mother.

I don't worship devils.

I haven't gone crazy.

And as far as Antichrist goes,
if my research goes as planned

We'll see.


This has to stop. I'm
at the breaking point.

Hey, here.

[door bell]

Are you expecting someone?

No.

[dog whimpering]
[Jeanine] Andy

Will you take Andy for
me, please. [door bell]

[door bell

[Laura, would you put
him in my room, please.

[door bell]

-[Jeanine] Come in -Here.

Something to wash
away the Bastini virus.

heard what happened.


I'm sorry about Andy, I don't know why he
behaves so aggressively, only around you.

That's true

maybe you should off him.

You know, to the vet. Give
him an injection or something.

Rinaldo!

Anyway, Bastini?

Ignorant hypocrite.
Right out of the inquisition.

Monsignor is not that nice.

He insulted me in front of my
students. Threatened my job.

Then you acquested your goal.

Bastini feels the rumbling
beneath his throne.

Closer.

I wonder. Seems if the final piece of
the puzzle just keeps slipping away.

We'll have it.

Maybe sooner than you expect.

After all these
years, what if... I'll fail?

What if Laura is right?

Keeping door of hell
seems to be all too real.

Noel was a remarkable
man, Jeanine.

But about his god, he
was... he was wrong.

Very wrong. You won't fail.

To pree astro physique you always
wanted. Someday, it will be yours.

I pray. Seems like it
drifts further and further.

All those that have come to
believe there is no god are here.

Supporting you on your journey.

My journey?

Stay with it, Jeanine.
You'll get there.

Able to predict the
future, Mr. Nostradamus?

Trust me.

Nostradamus had it right.

Ever since Noel died, I
haven't been much of a mother.

And not a good teacher
and not a very good friend.

I know.

I should really get some rest.

Whenever you need me, just...

Yeah, and thank you
again for the wine.

About your lecture
tomorrow. Be very careful.

Bastini just might try to give you a not
so gentle shove through the gates of hell.

Where did you hear that?

Enjoy the wine.

Santo Lucifero.

Very nice bottle

But the journey is worth it.

Thank you for being...
so encouraging.

[voice of Noel] You have nothing
to show for your misguided research.

such thing as systems...

Out of nothing...
Nothing... Nothing...

Ax at the heel of your feet

Always was, always will be...

Always was, always was...






[dog panting]

Professor Markham, I heard of
your recent encounter with Bastini.

Your research is leading you to the conclusion
that creation has nothing to do with god.

Now what is needed
by you is the final proof.

Irrefutable proof, that will once
and for all end the god-myth.

After a great deal of thought, I
have decided to reveal to you

what you have sought for so long

Enclosed find the directions to my home
for next Saturday seven in the evening.

I don't keep a phone,
so if you arrive, fine.

If not, so be it.

Very truly yours,
Jessica Dormender

Mum, why are you up so late?

There was a letter at the door.

Supposedly from Jessica Dormender,
but I rather assume someone is playing.

Jessica Dormender?

Ah, come here. She
was one of the greatest...

Awarded the Pree in '51 and '52.

Break through in relating Space
time pulses with time travel.

Sort of like backing
up the camera.

Then she just disappeared,
dropped off the face of the earth.

The FBI couldn't find her?

Hmm, although they searched,
but Dormender was never found.

Until now, maybe.

She's got to be
eighty, ninety even.

That's if she is alive,
if this letter is legit.

What, whoever
she is, has to say?

That she's got the answer.

To what?

Creation, the
beginning of everything.

What you have
been after forever?

Hmm, even longer than that.

And that she wants me to visit.

Visit her where, though?

In Doxton, three or
four hours from here.

Sounds fishy, Doormentor
or whatever she's called.

Disappears for all these
years and no one can find her.

But now she tells
you where she is.

Hmm. Weird, huh.

Probably just a sick joke.

You could be with one of
your friends, couldn't you?

My friends wouldn't
know Jessica Dormpoop...

Dormender.
If she dropped on their laps.


But what if it were
Jessica Dormender?

I better call Rinaldo
and have him along.

Could use his support.

Couldn't be...

Could it?

What if it was?

We need to get to bed.

[a bang]

[chanting music]

[sounds from the accident]

[chanting music]

son

[chanting music continues]


[loud crash]

[chanting music]


[eerier, suspenseful music]

Ah, Did you see that?


Andy

Andy?

We are good 150
miles from the dog.


Calm down.

[eerier sounds]

[unintelligible speech]

[eerier sounds]

[bangs on the steering wheel]


What's going on?

I saw him.


Noel

He was trying to
tell me something.

What?

I don't know. I just
saw him for a moment.

Noel is gone.

You must accept that, Jeanine.

Maybe I should drive.

at the next round.

There it is.

[bell rings]

[breaths heavily] Yeah


[dog growling]

Andy?

Andy is it you? Andy,
come here, Andy.

Come on.

How did Andy get
in this bloody house.


[knocking hard]

[from the inside] Patience.

[from the inside] here
I come. I'm coming.

Professor Markham! Come in!

Doctor Dormender.

Welcome! I've
been expecting you.

You are alive. I wasn't sure.

Well of course,
I'm alive, I think.

Uh-huh! Still pretty frisky, eh?

Amazing, I can't even do two.

Jeanine.

Put your coats on the hooks.

Thank you.


And please, no more
Doctor Dormender it's Jessica.

Now, How about some nice
hot tea, it will warm you up.

And you can have
a bit of my cake.

shouldn't have troubled yourself.


Thank you.

I would like to introduce you
to professor Rinaldo Algado

He's a fellow faculty
member at St. Genesius

It's an honor, Doctor Dormender.

And may I ask you, what
is your field of academia?

Dabble a bit in
Medieval History.

Rinaldo is far too modest. He is
actually acknowledged of being

one of the world's leading
authority on the Spanish inquisition.

His writings are a major
reference on the subject matter.

Particularly 16th
century instruments of...

Persuasion.

Yes, the ax.

My husband's collection.

From one of the more blood
thirsty North West Alaskan tribes.

It is said that their throwing
technique was so developed,

that they split open the skull
of a polar bear at fifty meters.

Fifty meters!

[clears throat]

You have a charming
home, Jessica.

Yes, my husband I have
enjoyed it for many years.

Oh, Mr. Dormender
will he be joining us?

there is no Mr. Dormender

Dormender was my maiden
name. I kept it after I was married.

My husband... Oh... You
must have heard of him

Doctor Professor
Sebastian Stillwell.

Sebastian Stillwell
is your husband?

Celestial Mathematics,
Astro-Physics, he's an icon.

Stood out from the
crowd, Sebastian did.

Including Albert
Einstein. [chuckles]

Nineteen forty nine. A big year.

Sebastian was far
ahead of his time.

Einstein was odd. [chuckles]
Begged for an appointment.

Visited us, had lunch with us,
downed several glasses of snaps,

Einstein snaps?

Albert loved his snaps.

What he was really after,
however, was Sebastian's opinion

on possibility of mathematical
imbalance to the time theorem


Albert was so pathetically confused
about essential mathematics.

Sebastian felt sorry for him,
tried to put him on the right track.

But Albert, always so
stubborn, stuck to his theory.

That must have been what lead to
his mistakes in the Theory of Relativity.

Good for you.

Anyway, Albert
bid to join our team.

We declined. Sebastian felt our
research had left Albert far behind.

was almost in tears.

Uh, Jessica, you really,
you shouldn't have...

Gone to this much trouble.
No trouble.

Now, if you're finished...

Let us get to why you came here.

Follow me.


No need to panic.

[clinking sound]
[door creaks]


Just look.

miss something that is really important.



the leather chair if you like...

Sebastian used to sit there, when he was
into some of his most original concepts.

[loud scream]

Like Einstein I was reversing the
predominate gravitational effects.

It seemed like
the only possibility.

Einstein was wrong, I was wrong.

Uh, yes, in front of me, what
I've been after all these years.

And what you're saying is what
the church has been fearing forever...

Jessica you must
make this known.

sure I could... But I won't.

Being raised first baptized meant
standing at the fore front of faith...

And then to realize that our
search had led to conclusions...

That proved,
irrefutably proved...

There was no God.

Well.

Jessica, what you have here will finally end the myth.
[Jessica] Yes.

That's why I'm making this research available to you.
[loud bang]

What was that?
[Jessica chuckles]

Furnace trouble. [chuckles]

be getting too hot lately.

Nothing to worry about.

The furnace guy
will be coming soon.

A gentle tap on the floor.

Must move one of the pipes,
stops that damn rumbling.

There's significance in it all.
I could, but I'm not going to.

But Jessica...
No, never!

I invited you here, because it is
you who must make this known...

With your preeminent position
in the world of astro physics...

You'll be credited with
the appropriate perception.

Besides, Sebastian and I could
never deal with the publicity if...

We were the ones put forth
that finally put the dagger in God.

Jessica, you deserve...
No.

for you alone to take the credit.

But... The inclement might
come with it, maybe even the pree.

[Jessica] Likely.
[Rinaldo] Didn't I tell you Jeanine?


The notoriety that
comes from fame.

Sebastian wouldn't
much care for that.

But Jessica...
No.

Final no.

Now, do I have your
agreement or not?

And if not, the
search remains here.

The papers which you took
notes are only part of the answer.

There is more... That
will clearly irrefutably...

Validate the no God concept.

And...

It is in my hands.

My ace in the hole.

So?

Do we have an agreement?

Good.

better be getting home.

It's a little bit of a ride
back to Saint Genesius.

know what to say, except for thank you.

No need for thanks, no need.

My thanks will be the
results of all I've given you.

Thank you again.

Look after than furnace
problem, Jessica.

Seems a bit impatient.

Furnace repairman will figure it
out, he's pretty good at his job.

Atheistic, I'd
love to hear them.

I haven't heard one yet.

How does something come from
nothing, with extreme fine tuning.

What is the
explanation for that?

[man 2] All we know
is how little we know.

That's been for many years my
definition of an educated person.

Someone who knows enough
to know who ignorant they are.

[man] Uh, Arthur Edington...
[man 2] It is a wonderful thing.


to multi... [voice fades]

[news jingle]

based on his static universe
model, missed the target...

In actuality it was self existing gravitational
factors which were the very beginning.

The first heart beat
if you will, of creation.

Issues that were once unresolved
are now conclusively resolved.

So where is your research
heading, professor?


assured they are right.

Now that the God thing was dealt
with, the possibilities are endless.

For me there are
scientists everywhere...


Your so called evidence it's
just not even understandable.

But you have to admit, Monsignor,
that what professor Markham presented...

It's overwhelming outlets.
[Monsignor] I'll admit...

It's more like an overwhelming
exercise in scientific gibberish.

Self-existing gravitational...

rather in [inaudible]

Einstein's comilog...

Cosmiracle...

Constant...

It's just gibberish
no matter what.

You question, Monsignor?

Professor... Doctor...

Or as you prefer, madam...

Do you have any...

I emphasize, any...

Irrefutable proof...

Of this dubious proposition
of yours, of self-existence...

I mean I could make you 100
more likely and call it science.

Even witch craft.

Taking on, to the
Monsignors question...

Professor, have your calculations,
would they be of science or...

As the Monsignor
characterizes it, witch craft.

Attaches to the Monsignors
indications to a non-existing God.

There has not been a single such
institution that has disproved my findings.

research is rubbish!

It's complete rubbish,
it's convoluted!

Shall we say, understandable?

And you for allowing
such nonsense.

To be spoken as truth,
and shame on you madam.

knowing your place.

I...

Pray to the good Lord.

To spare you his wraith.

I'm... Finding...

Difficult... Now to
repeat... That purely...

Got to go.

you Monsignor Bastini.

Professor Markham, thank you for this enlightening interview.
Of course.

And thank you, our viewers...

For tuning in.

[loud bell ringing]

streets, very early this morning,

when all this started,
around 6:50am...

So now all around me there
is just trash all in the city.

[lady reporter] Streets were
trashed, and police responded to it.

[indistinctive radio report]

[indistinctive chatter]


You couldn't leave it alone, could
you? You had to take God from us...

doing you crazy son of a bitch!

[indistinctive radio report]

religion no longer
offers anything important.

I think that is exactly wrong.

[man 2] Does God exist?

[man 3] With me, yes it does.

It must do.

He must do
because... [voices fade]


Yes of course I'm with you.

I don't believe you.

-Well I'm sorry Laura, but the
truth matters... -And what about me?

Don't I matter?

Like dad, I wanted
to have God in my life.

Doesn't it mean anything to you?

It's nothing but an attempt to
ward off the realities of death.

even if true...

Don't need to be exposed.

But you are too selfish and wrapped
up in your science understand...

I am sorry that
you feel that way...

But you must know,
that you, not Science...

Are the center of my life.

Then show it.

Do not walk out...

[phone ringing]

[phone continues ringing]

[indistinctive radio report]

[college leader] The Istle Physic Committee
is pleased to present this year's recipient...

I am proud to present,
Dr. Jeanine Markham,

with this distinction for conclusive
research entitled 'A Final Cosmic Answer.'

[crowd applause]

[applause continues]

I would like to thank
the committee...

For bestowing all my research
to this great, great honor.

But I must confess, that in carrying
out my research to it's conclusions...

It's always been a
serious concern of mine...

To prove that God is not in fact the creator
to all those who believed in a God...

To take away
something so special...

Though it be fiction...

Was not an easy task.

But my final
determination was and is...

That truth...

Is all.

And that has led
me to this great...

Award in which you give me
tonight and for that I thank you.

[crowd applause]


The piaster physic,
all of it, it's fabulous!

Fabulous that my daughter
won't even talk to me anymore.

Your daughter?

Jeanine...

Keep your mind on now.

You've turned the entire
world upside down...

Something's bothering me,
I just don't know what it is.

you, no one gets rid of it...

Thousands of years...

Making us play his game,
forcing us to pay the privilege.

He's foolish.

I just don't want to cry.

He's only the 17th director.

Breathe. All will
be beyond soon.

Also believed in God. I clinged on to him
as the last hope in this miserable world.


I never gave them much thought.

yourself, Jeanine.

Think about the pree.



I've taken God from
them, they frighten me.

Like they've lost a child.

Yes, their only child.

that it was a child that never existed.

For centuries', a false image.

But no perhaps... Something...

Real.

What are you talking about?

Oh nothing. [chuckles]

Come on, let's dance.

[phone ringing]
[phone dialing]

[voice recording] Please leave
your message after the tone...

Press any key to end...
[beep]

And that's your fault,
I hope you're happy.

I hope you're fucking happy!

I'll burn your
fucking house down.

Give you a taste of how you'll spend eternity.
[beep]


Andy!

[Andy softly growling]



Patience

Mommy will be down
in just a moment.

trouble with youth today...

No patience.

I keep telling you, you got to
be careful, playing with matches.

Don't want to burn
this dump down, do we?





[thud]
What?

Jessica Dormender,
Dormender house...

What happened to it?

you talking about?

You look so much like her...

Younger.

You're Jessica Dormender, I
visited you at your house and...

Now it's no longer there...

You're so much younger...
What's no longer there?

What are you talking, about lady?
You're Jessica.

to do with your Jessica crap?

You better leave before
I call the cops, bitch.

You, you were ancient now
you're so young, and you're,

you're voice!
Ancient? [chuckles]

I'm barely 20-years old.

Have you hit your
head or something?

Madame.

You know besides,
it's really later.


You're not going to leave?


You better come here,
there's a crazy lady.

Something about a
Jessica ancient she said...

What is it madam?


You're... But you're a student
in my astro physics class...

And Sebastian Stillwell he's got to
be 100-years old, he's got to be dead.

didn't act dead a few minutes ago...

The bitch has been calling me
Jessica, saying I used to be ancient.

Now she thinks she knows you...

You must be mistaken, madam.

Is there anything
we can do for you?

[heavy breathing] No.

[heavy breath]
[scream]


It's great seeing you.

Twang? Samuel
Clemmings, it can't be you...

Space time suspended
animation does the trick.

Well as for being dead...

I'm still pretty frisky
for being dead.

Your reputation and courage has
struck an accordion in my heart.

Albert, it struck a
chord in my heart.

This can't be real.

It's what we call
suspended animation...


Where am I?


In a world that is blind.

In my child I speak for all of us when
I say, that you have enriched science.

[Jeanine] Aristotle, it can't be you...
Anything is possible, Jeanine.

Anything and everything.

Your writing is a natural motion. A
motion that requires an extreme cause...

Self-existing concepts,
makes you live like them...

Your research of self-existence,
far exceeds my infantile efforts.

Come along, Jeanine.

Let me introduce you to one
of your loveliest supporters.

Madame Du Barry.
It's a great pleasure...

To meet such a remarkable woman.

And so charming. [chuckles]

Indeed.

Madame Du Barry haven't
we met somewhere before?

No, oh no, it's impossible.

I would never forget such a
remarkable and charming woman.

Mr. Twang I'm sure I've met
Madame Du Barry somewhere before.

where did you say I am?

You're in the world
of the irrefutable.

And you're all here...
To support you!

And to help you on your mission.

But why?

Did you not swear on the
path, faith is chosen for you...

And everything is present
in such proper order.

But the 666 on the research...

Is this real?

Surly it's all a matter of
one's perspective, isn't it?

I know what I saw...
Jeanine.

What does 999 look like?

Upside down.
Yeah.

When the bottom is the top,

and the top is the bottom.

The bottom is the top
and the top is the bottom...

Well now I, I see it clearly.

Yeah, that's how you see it.

999 upside down, how
stupid of me for not seeing that.

She was 90 then 20,
then 20 then 90 and...

It's a nightmare, mental fatigue,
the pressure, overwhelming...

Charles Darwin, Charlie...

Professor Jeanine Markham.

Mr. Darwin, I've been such a
fan of yours ever since high school.

How flattering.

But your research, far more
important than anything I've ever done.

It's what we've
been waiting for.


Even longer.
And now you've all made it so clear...


Upside down.
So the research, it was true.

Completely.
And having nothing to do with the devil...

[all laugh]

I'm so grateful to you all,
for helping me get this right.

And for reassuring me...

[Jeanine and man] That
it was absolutely not his.

But a great astrophysicist.

Which is what you
are, your research...

Irrefutable. [echoes]

Father...

Rinaldo.

Jeanine.

I see you've met my friends.

They've been dying to meet you.

[Jeanine screams]

What have you done to my dog!

What did you do!


Somebody help!

Andy!


but he is very interested
in attending Geniuses.

And his academic
qualifications imply outstanding...

I thought you wouldn't
mind seeing him...

fine, just please remind me.

That I have that curriculum
committee meeting...

I don't want to miss it.
Ok.

I'll be with you in a moment, in the meantime
why don't you tell me a bit about yourself.

Well I'm very interested
in attending, Geniuses.

Wasn't the universities name
originally Saint Geniuses?

Yes, but the administration decided to eliminate
saint, once the God favor was put to rest.

Mom, mom, mom!

coming out of your faint.

Would you like a cookie?

us quite the scare.

Would you like a cup of tea?

Mom, wake up. You
were having a nightmare.

Mom.
They were all there...

Albert Einstein.

Ernest Dunham.

I could tell...


Is that the priest physic...

That you were awarded for your
research and eliminating the God family?

pre-committee said that...

The research was some of the most original
that's ever been put before them...

Einstein, Darwin, Du Barry?

Most original.

Wow, it's uh...

It's a big compliment coming
from the pre-committee.


Need for that.

We'll take care of you.

Please, I need to call my daughter.
Your daughter?

I'm sure Laura isn't anxious.

I'm quite sure.

Where's dad?

Dad?

Mom, you're scaring me, maybe
we should get you to a hospital?

I don't want to go to a hospital,
I just don't understand any of it.

And that lovely painting.

Of your late husband perhaps...

Yes, there was a
terrible accident.

He was a good looking
guy your husband...

Of course... He wasn't
that good looking...

[police radio]
[sirens]

I had to get rid of Luke.

My entire plan would
have crumbled...

You do understand?

Don't you?

All those who have come to
realize there's no God, are here.

Supporting you, on your journey.


It's a pity about Laura.


[man chuckles]

She was such a... Mmm...

Charming child.

But!

You would have been spending
too much time with her and...

I wanted you all
to myself, so...

I decided to do her the
same time I did Noel.

Sort of like a supermarket,
buy one get one free.


[indistinctive radio]


Oh!

[man chuckles]

Oh, I owe you, sugar.

If it hadn't been for you...

I might be still
repairing furnaces.


Let me out!


Let's get down to doing what
us devil's really like doing.

[door creaks]

[muffled screams]
It's ok, relax.


[screaming in distance]


[screams loudly]

[scream echoes]

[suspenseful eerie music]


[sobbing continues]

[church bell rings]

[light upbeat music]

[music ends]
