I'll be right back.

Do you remember that
phase that jack went trough?

When he literally would take

everything out of his bins.

And toy area, and set
it up all over the house.

Yeah.
Yeah.

I talked to Ashley the other day

and Connor's one hundred
percent in that phase.

That's tough.

She is dying. She's like, I need to
be around people that I can talk to,

and not have to... I mean, she's done.

She's got to get away.

Alright.
What can we do?

And, we have to bring David.

Alright. He's funny, he's funny.
He is.

He doesn't work much.

But he's funny. Then why do
you still have him work for you?

Because he's funny.

Comedy relief.

He's a good guy.
Yeah, he is.

No, we like him.

But what can we-
Only becuase he's funny.

That's the only reason
Ashley likes him too. True.

Um, I don't know. Bring them here.

Do you think they'd make it?

I mean it's so pretty, but I don't know.

Justdon't tell them.

Okay.
Yeah.

Just tell them we'll go
camping or something,

but don't tell them where.

Or that they have to walk a lot.

Yeah.

What about Chad?

I haven't seen Chad in so long.

I know. We should get him out of the bar.

Is he still there all the time?
All the time.

I haven't seen him in a long time either.

He's supposed to be my best friend.

We need to go.

And Becky?

I see her, just not in person.

Yeah, you see her alright. Influencer!

I still don't know what that is.

Aren't you an influencer?
No.

You influence me all the time.
For bad things. That's my job.

No, ask him. He probably needs
to come out more than Ashley.

True. Yeah, I'll ask him.

Does he like to hike?

He goes outdoors. I mean, he won't mind it.

Hopefully he's in shape.
I don't know, bar shape is different.

I know he doesn't do much else.

Doesn't matter. We won't tell them where.
We'll just tell them camping.

Because they should see this.
Maybe they'll get out more.

Yeah.

We'll ask them. I'll tell Ashley.

It's a deal.

Okay.
Let's go.

Good.
Ready?

Great.
You hungry?

Hungry.
Now?

Let's go.

The Karate Kid!

Kai is following us!

Dana. This was a really good idea.

I can't take all the credit.
Jack had a little to do with it.

Yes I did.

It kind of reminds me
of like old days though.

Sneaking away for a couple days.

But we don't have to worry about my parents
finding out that we're not really at Jennifer's.

Right!

How did Connor take it?

Poor baby. He like wouldn't
even let us leave the door.

He was blocking it. He didn't
want us to put our bags in the car.

But then Grandma showed up with donuts,
and he was like shooing us out.

He was kicking us out basically.

That's just like Jack Jr.

You know who's reallly
excited to brave the outdoors?

Becky.

She can't wait to get
dirty, and eat out of a can.

Hey Becky. Can you hear me?

What?

Go ahead. Get some more followers on Insta.

Shut up.

That's terrible.

Take a look at Chad.

That poor guy.

He hasn't had a break
since he opened that bar.

How long has it been?

8 years?

70, 80 hours a week.

Poor guy.

You're a good friend.

I'm the best friend.

Take a look at that

We still have another two hours to go.

Two hours?

Look how pretty the sky is.

Did we forget something?

No. I want to talk to the locals, and see if there
is anything we should know before we head out there.

Good idea.

Sporting goods?

Wanna get some beef jerkey.

You already packed all of your beef jerkey.

Can't have enough beef jerkey.

Right Jack?

That is right, not enough, ever!

Are you coming?

Yeah.

You're awake.

Good morning.

Good morning Chad.

Hey.

You can't take these guys anywhere.

You look beautiful...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

How about this?

What are we doing?

It's pretty.
You want one of those?

Kind of.
A mountain lion?

Wow!

This place is cool man!
Check it out.

Whoa!

You got it.

Hey ma.

Thanks a lot for inviting us.
No, thank you for coming,

I know how hard it is
for you guys to get away.

Yeah. I, I...
I really needed this.

I swear that place is gonna kill me.

It is gonna kill ya.
Those 17 hour days.

So... How are you?

No complaints man, I'm doing great.

Kids?

Dana's great, the kids are great.
Good.

You want one?

Kids?

I already have my hands full.

Lord have mercy. Come on man.

Wait a minute. What do we have here?

Finally somebody worth my attention.

Mamacitas, little chicas.

Crisiva devichski

Little lolitas, yeah.

Wow, that one.

Yeah!

Is anybody even here?

Like a clerk?

Hey Ashley! He's cuter than you are.

Excuse me!

I'm sorry young folks. All my help
called in sick today, I'm here by myself.

It's alright.
It's fine.

You got ladies with you. We don't
usually get such pretty ladies in here.

We got a couple of them, that's for sure.
Special day!

So, how can I help you guys?

Yeah, we're headed up to big cat trail.

And a couple of these
ladies are first time hikers.

Really?
Kind of show them-

It wouldn't be my first
choice to take hiker.

I mean, it can be treacherous.
Treacherous?

There's some legends here, I mean

Sedona has their vortexes,

But we got some crazy shit out there.

I mean, you go way back
to the 60s, cattle mutilations.

Remember reading about that? They found cattle with
their eyballs cut out, their buttholes cut out.

Stuff like that.
We're just gling for a hike.

I mean, skunk apes. You know what that is?

You watch TV?
Yeah, Yeah.

It looks like a sasquatch. It's
like sasquatch's little brother.

Down in Florida there's legends.
Well they've been spotted up here too.

People have gone up there looking for them.
And

Where are you taking us?

Satan worshippers.

I was up there once, on a hill top.
There we go.

I actually found that up there.
What the heck is this doing up there?

I added this later, I
mean it's kind of a trophy.

This just doesn't occur, I mean somebody-Maybe
we can find one of those up there. Who knows?

Itll go right in your bar.

Hopefully you got
plans to protect yourself.

With something.

We got a little .22.

Exactly. A little .22.
What skunk ape is gonna

is gonna laugh at a .22. I got some stuff that is
a little more exotic you might be interested in.

Yeah, but we're just going on a
hike though. We should be fine.

Where are you taking us? What are
you talking about? This is gonna be great!

I don't know. He's talking
about apes and skulls and stuff.

And you believe that?

It might be knid of cool.
Exactly! i knew you'd come around.

We appreciate it. We thank you so much.

Alrigh. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Hey, I found it!

I knew these things were real.

Get one of me.

New profile pic. Let me see it.

It's awesome.

Sir. Hey, are we gonna find any of these,
like live ones out there, out in the woods?

I wouldn't worry about that.

I'd worry about those guys up there.

They get twice that size too.

It mean, it's a chupacabra
for goodness sake. Is it real?

Those are gonna be out there? These
are real. That's a mountain lion. Yeah.

Thewhole southwest is full of those.

Yeah right.
And that's half as big as they get.

So that's what I'd worry about.

Thanks!

Are you guys ready to go?
Yeah.

Let's get out of here.

Did he really just say skunk ape?

Yeah, skunk apre. You
know, bigfoot of the south.

Right, but.. Out here?

He also talked about a
goat man, devil worshippers.

Don't worry. None of tat is real.

They are trusting us.

Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. What are you worried about?

Come on.

Now this is what I'm
talking about young folks.

We'll get some yeehaws out of that skunk
ape, and they will sit up and take notice.

A real flamethrower.

Okay. You can go ahead
and get some skunk ape.

Get your hands off me you damn dirty ape!

Yeah, get some!

Take some of that!

We gota get two man.
Yes!

Mother-aper.

Yippee ki yay!

Take that skunk ape.

That's what you need
right there young folks!

That's how we do it!

This is it?

Yeah, no one for miles.

No cell service either.

Yeah babe, that's the point.

You know. You just get away
from it all fr a couple of days.

As long as I'm back for my
Facebook live Thursday night.

You'll be back.

So, what do you think?

It's gorgeous.

We have to bring the kids back.

Alright you guys. We have two options.

Take jackrabbit trail. It's
about three miles more or less.

Or we can take all the gear with us.

Head up to big cat trail and
camp out there for the night.

How far is big cat?

Seven miles.

S... Seven miles?

Seven miles?
One way.

Can I vote for rabbit?
Me too.

No. Guys come one, we're here.

Let's do it. Big cat trail.

I agree, big cat trail. It's up to you.

What do you say? Big cat or jackrabbit?

Jackrabbit.

The rabbit wins boys.

Yeah, sure.

Wait, wait. What if it was a tie?

Then the driver's vote counts as two.

Wow.

Those are the rules.

Wrong. The driver's
wife's vote counts as two.

I didn't learn that in civics class.

You didn't learn anything in civics.

True.

Alright. That's good enough.

Take only what you need,
and don't forget your water.

And leave everything else in the tent.

Come on! Let's get this
party started. Let's go!

Wait, wait! My phone.

Only what you need Becky. You
just said there's no reception out here.

Photos.

Wait! Can i have my phone?

Come on you guys.
Let's go!

You don't even pause, you don't even pause!

Look. Even her phone looks like a camera.

Control your man Ashley.

I need to get a stick.

That's a good one.

This is pretty cool.

Ouch!

I must really love you.
I guess so.

He's really skinny though.

He's gotta ruin everything.

I don't know how you-
You ruined my life!

Geez!

Hey! What are you doing?

Can we help you?

I didn't mean to scare
anyone, I just saw the campsite.

Making sure everyone was okay.

Jack.

Tex.

Yeah, we're all fine.

Probably be a good idea for you
to head back to your campsite.

You know. Before it gets too dark.

Yeah. Yeah, I will.

You guys have a good rest of the night.

Alright, you too.

Did you guys think that
guys was super creepy?

100 percent.

He was definitely up to something.

I swear he was this close to
stealing all of our stuff from the tent.

Yeah. We need to take to take
everything with us tomorrow.

And what we don't, we
need to put in the truck.

I'm sure he was just a
good samaritan on a stroll.

By himself?

Sarcasm font Becky.

Whatever.

All joking aside. A friend of mine
is a game warden in California.

California? Near Los Angeles?

Yeah. Right in downtown LA. Bam!

You should see the wildlife there.

No. Up in Tahoe.

Charles?

Yeah. He told me that he is actually
responsble for 300 square miles of wilderness.

Just himself and his K-9.

Wow. Did he ever run into Bigfoot?

I'd love, like, his autograph.

A game warden's autograph?

No! Bigfoot's autograph.

You know how much money I'd make off that?

Anyway, he told me that

the National Parks were full
of people running from the law.

Escaped convicts, felons, bail jumpers.

Seriously?

Yeah. He has a bunch of stories about
encounters that he's had.

I don't know. They run out into the woods
thinking that no one will ever find them.

Game warden surprises
them. They have nothing to lose.

And they are usually armed.
It's a dangerous situation.

Wow man. Thanks for the bedtime story.

It's better to be aware.

So that guy today could
have been a murderer?

Could have. Could have been a hiker.

That reminds me of a campfire story.

These three boys were at wilderness camp
and they were sneaking out-

Between the girl cabin and the girl cabin.

Was-

Jumping chollas.

Those damn chollas.

On that note. We're gonna to go to bed.

But we were just in to-

Goodnight guys.

Giddy up!

Well, would you look at the time.

Where's my watch?

Maybe you left it at he?

No, no. Tha's my father's
watch. I brought it for good luck.

Maybe it's in the truck.

No. No, I remember that-

Maybe it's in the truck.

Maybe it's in the truck.
Yeah!

Yeah, okay.

Hey. If you guys need-
Goodnight Chad.

Yeah, yeah, but if-

Goodnight you two.

Yeah, goodnight.

Something about being in nature.

Are you cold?

A little.

Thanks.

You better get some sleep. It's
going to be a long day tomorrow.

What's bothering you?

Something was off about that guy Tex.

Yeah, I thought so too.

If you're still cold, I can
tell Chad and Becky-

No. No.

They're finally relaxing like they used to.

Besides. I want to be out here next to you.

Get it off! Get it of!
Stand still!

I can't find it!

Get it off me!
Stand still!

I got it.
Are you sure?

I got it. I got it.
Are you sure?

Yeah, I got it.

Jack, that's a little
much for a spider. Isn't it?

You're good.

Good morning everyone.

Whose hungry?

Hey, that's my...

Relax man. There's plenty of
this stuff for everybody. Okay.

You can share. Be a nice boy David.

Jack. Teriyaki or original?

Original.
There you go.

David?
Teriyaki.

Ladies?

I have my own food.

Dana?
Original.

Original. Breakfast is served.

This is definitely not original.

Alrigh. Let's do this!

Don't I look cute?

Wow. You look beautiful babe.

Thanks babe.

Is everyone else ready to go?

Yeah, okay guys.

Take your wallet and your phones.

And anything else you don't want stolen.

And put everything else
in the truck this time guys.

See, that's what I was talking about.

Don't worry. She's got nothing on you.

Bring all your jerkey.

All of it?

Unless you want to carry the extra water?

I'll be the jerkey.

Come on.

Can we take a break?

Is your makeup running?

Shut p.

We have been walking. We have
to be at least somewhere close.

We've been walking forever.
No. An hour and fifteen minutes.

Are you kidding me? That's it?

Yeah.

How much farther do we have?

About five and a half miles.

Five and a half miles?
You can do it.

Are you kidding me? I'm staying right
here. I'll wait for you guys to come back

I think that's a good idea.

Come on.

Nope! We are all in this together.

Forward ho!

Who gave him coffee?

I want some.

Would you look at that...

Gorgeous.

We're witnessing history.

It's beautiful babe, but I think
other people have seen this before.

No, I'm not talking about nature, Becky.

We got all the way here and
she hasn't taken a selfie yet.

Poor Becky.

But we should take a picture.
It's so pretty.

I hate pictures. I don't care.
Here Becky, take a picture of us.

Alright.

Open your eyes David.

What's that?
Where?

Down there.

It's gold.

We're rich!

Hey! That's-

That's my Dad's watch.

But how did it get?

It ws that guy at the campsite yesterday.

See, I told you guys he was a criminal.

There wasn't even anything
missing from the tent.

Well maybe it fell off my wrist when
we were putting the tent together.

Then when he was going
through our stuff, he picked it up.

But hey. I told you guys.
It's my good luck charm.

What is it?

Shh.

Did you hear that?

No.

I think we should get out of here.

I don't have no argument
with that. Let's go. Yeah.

Come on.
Let's go.

Come on Jack.

I gotta take a piss.
Yeah, me too.

Yeah, I have to go too.

Ou guys can go over there.

Another stop.

Jack!

Shit, Jack!

Jack.

Jack, what the hell is this?

Should we take them with us?

I'm not touching those man.

No, no. That's just a prank.
That happens all the time.

A prank?

It's best to be safe, and let
the sheriff know where it is.

If that's a prank, that's sick.
And by sick, I mean kind of awesome.

And you guys give us a hard time aobut
going to the bathroom together.

Anyway. You're not going to
believe what we found back there-

Hey! We gotta hurry up.
We're losing light.

Let's go.

What happened?

I don't know what's going on.

We need to get back to
the truck and get out of here.

But I don't want them to freak out.

Okay.

Let's move it people!

What's the rush now?

Aren't you hungry?

Yeah. I guess so.

Okay.

Victory!

Wait. Jack.

The truck is gone.

What?

The truck. It's been stolen!

I can't believe this. We are
in the middle of nowhere.

I mean I can see this happening in
Downtown Phoenix, but out here?

I mean, really?

It was that guy Tex! He waited for us to
leave, and then he stole the truck!

You forgot to take my watch!

How are we gonna get out of here?

And he has my purse! I canâ€™t call
to cancel my credit cards.

You didn't take it with you?

I didnâ€™t want to carry it.

Alright guys. We have to remain calm.

We're stuck out here!

Maybe for a little while, but weâ€™re next to
the road. The ranger will come by tonight.

And Weâ€™ll flag him down.

We were going to stay an extra night
anyway. Weâ€™ll just all share the tent.

We're going to all fit in the tent.

Dana and I, we'll sit in
the chairs and stand guard.

I'm sorry. Stand guard? Is there something
youâ€™re not telling us?

Alright. Someone stole the truck, there
is nothing we can do about that now.

But one thing is for sure, we canâ€™t
go running into the wilderness at night.

So weâ€™re going to sit here
and wait for the ranger.

Jack. What about the
bloody clothes back there?

Bloody clothes?

Yeah, some psychopath chopped some
people up and stole our truck.

We peed next to dead bodies?

No. No. They're aren't any dead bodies.

How do you know?

Do you see any?

No.

And you were right next to the clothes.

As long as we stick together,
we're going to be fine.

What if the park ranger doesn't come?

Then we will wait until morning,
hike out to the main road.

We passed several cars and RVs on
the way in. Someone will pick us up.

What about dinner? Did he steal that too?

Iâ€™m afraid so.

Your hero saves the day.

Gus's Beef Jerkey!

Teriyaki, Original Jack.

Always prepared baby.

Hey John, talk to me
over here for a minute.

John? Who's John?

Is that like an ex or something?

That's my name.

That's not your name. It's Jack.
Is it John, or is it Jack?

It's John, but Jack is short for John.

What?

You've heard of JFK right?

President John F. Kennedy. Iâ€™m not stupid.

Jackie, Robert, his whole
family referred to him as Jack.

What?

Thatâ€™s totally made up.
Iâ€™m so done with this day.

Are you ready for bed?

I'm beyond tired.
I'm tired too.

Goodnight.

Yeah, I think it's time to hit the sack.

I'm exhausted.

I just want this day to be over.
Wake me up if the ranger comes,

Otherwise, Iâ€™ll see you in
the morning. Goodnight.

Goodnight.

John.

Yeah?

Do you think somebody killed those people?

I don't know.

What it is you keep hearing?

Sounds like a low growl. Very
quiet.

Animal?

Thatâ€™d be my guess. Mountain lion
maybe?

But a mountain lion wouldnâ€™t
stalk a group of humans. They'd...

do everything they could to avoid us.

Exactly.

The only thing I can think of,
is maybe the animal is rabid?

I mean, that's happened before.

A rabid cougar?

That's a horror movie.

Yeah.

And we're out here in the open.

It hasnâ€™t attacked us yet, right?

Maybe it's a coyote waiting
to go through our trash.

You think we're safe?

Yeah.

I'm not falling asleep.

And you're not either.

Insect?

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry. A little jumpy.

(screaming

David! Where's David?

David!

Jack!

Jack!

Jack!

Do you see it?

No!

Let's go. Come on!

Is anybody here?

I'm just stopping by
to check on your folks.

Nice little campsite.
Chairs are facing a fire though.

Not looking at the sunrise.

I guess I'll be back later.
I'll be back later to check on you guys!

Where are we going?
What are we doing?

We should be looking for David.

He's dead.

Chad!

What? He's dead isn't he?

We don't know if he's dead.

Did you not see all the blood?

Look! Look at you!

He's dead!
That's enough! Leave her alone.

Come on man. Don't lose you head.

I woke up this morning,
covered in my friends blood.

There's something out there that's
hunting us. How am I supposed to act?

Well that girl right there is
covered in her husband's blood.

And we don't even know where the body is.

You think she'd even want to see the body?

It's probably chewed up, and torn up by
a goddamned wild animal.

You're right.

I'm sorry man.

Keep it together! We need you.

Hey Ashley.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that I hurt you.

Sorry guys.
We'll keep looking.

Now we have to go very
quietly and very quickly.

Alright?

Yeah? No? Yeah? You ready?

If you say so.

Alright. Let's go.

David's shirt!
Ashley, no!

Dana!

Jack, shoot it!

I don't see it! I don't see it!

Shoot it!

There's two! Jack, there's two!

Shoot it! Shoot them!
Whre is it, I don't see it!

What are you doing? Shoot it!

Becky!

Becky!

Dana, Dana!

Come on!

Hello! The park ranger.

Looks the same as this morning.

Nothing's changed.

It feels different.

Someone in here?

Blood.

No trail?

Human.

Mary this is Gil. Come in.

Mary this is Gil. Do you copy?

Loud and clear.

We have ourselves here a
possible animal attack at big cat.

Copy that.

Notify the sheriff;s department.
I'm gonna head up the trail.

Roger.

Over and out.

Go, go, go.
Is it behind us?

Nah, nah. I don't think it's following us.

What are we going to do?

I don't know. But we just
have to keep going. Okay?

We have to go find him.

I don't want to leave right here. I think we're safe
here and I don't want to go back out there with them.

Becky and Chad need us.

But who is going to protect
us if we get attacked?

They would do the same for you Ash.

Look, that's a chance you're
gonna have to take. Alright?

I don't think I can do it.

Hey, look. You can. do this for Connor.

You're all he has left. You can do it.

I'll help you.

Come on.

Thatâ€™s enough

What are you doing?

This trail ends! What happens
when we get to the top?

I don't know. Weâ€™ll figure
out something out. Okay?

We were all supposed to stay together!

Youâ€™re the one who ran off first!

Iâ€™m not going any further. All those survival
shows tell you to stay put when youâ€™re lost.

Weâ€™re not lost! A man-eating animal somewhere
out there and it's chasing us right now!

I donâ€™t care! Iâ€™m not moving.

So this is your plan then? You're just going to
stay here until that thing comes and kills us?

No. Iâ€™m going stay here and wait for the
others. They canâ€™t be that far behind us.

But we don't even
know if they're behind us.

They could havegone in the other direction.
Or for all we know, they could be dead!

No.

Stop.
No, no... Theyâ€™re not-

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

What I mean is. They haven't
been behind us the entire time.

Maybe they went off and got sme help.

We have to keep going. That'll buy us more time
for Jack, or the park ranger to come find us.

Okay?

Okay?

Okay.

Come on.

Gil, do you copy?

Yeah Mary. Go ahead.

Whatâ€™s your 20?

Iâ€™m about a two miles in.

Youâ€™re on own for a little while. Sheriffâ€™s
responding to an abandoned van. Possible homicide.

Roger that.
Copy that.

Iâ€™ll update accordingly.

Over and out.

We need to find David.

Hey, we will. Right Jack?

Yeah.

We're almost there.

Isn't this where we stopped?
What?

To pee?

I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

No. This is it.

I want to see them.
See what?

The bloody clothes.

Why? Why do you want to see them-
Maybe the left a knife or something

behind to protect ourselves with.

It didn't do them any good. Becky!

See, I told you. Nothing.

Now seriously. We have to keep going.

Meu Deus.

I don't want to die like this.

You're not going to die.

Okay.

Seriously, we have to keep going.

I promise.

Becky.

Hey, hey. Come on!

Come on.

Stop.

Let's go! What are-

I hear footsteps.

Hey! Iâ€™m ranger, Gil, Gil
Rodgers. Are you guys okay

Yeah, yeah. We're alright.

Is that your camp down there?
Yeah.

Itâ€™s in terrible shape.
None of you are hurt?

No. We're alright. But three
of our friends are missing.

We're being hunted by
a couple mountain lions.

Youâ€™re mistaken about mountain lions.
They donâ€™t hunt large groups of humans.

Well then what would have dne this?

What's that?

This is my husband David's shirt.

He needs medical attention. Where is he?

We haven't found him.

Mary, come in

Go ahead.

It looks like large predator has in
fact, been attacking our hikers.

Get that sheriff to send some deputies
down here. And send the medical.

Roger that.

And warn the Apache County rangers as well.
I think-

Gil.

Gil. Do you Copy?

You get a shot. Take it!

I'm planning on it.

That's not a good idea. I think we should
go back to the camp,

Get all your stuff, and head ot of here.

The sheriff will be coming soon.

Gil! Come in! If you can here this, get in your
vehicle. The sheriff is warning of extreme danger.

Heâ€™s headed your way.
Gil!

Be careful, there were two.

When we get to that campsite,
get what you need.

Drive back into town,
and leave the rest to me.

Our truck was stolen.

Did you report it?

We haven't had a chance to yet.

I hear that they found an
abandoned truck out on the highway.

I'll drive you past it. See if it's yours.

Gil!

You see that?

What?

The glare.
No.

It looks metallic. Maybe glass.

On top. It's got-

What is this? Somekind
of homemade contraption?

Speakers? And on top.

Some kind of motion detector.

What is-

What the hell is going on?

That's the end of that.

Is this a forrest-
Is this one of yours?

No ma'am.

Ashley!
Ashley!

What are you doing in our home?

This land, it belongs to the state.

No, it belongs to us!

Who's us?

The rightful owners.

We can talk about this. You let her go.

No more talking.

Go!

I'm not leaving you!

Dana, get out of here!

Go!
No!

John!

Another gorgeous Arizona day in the books. Days
like today remind those snowbirds why they have a

why they have a second mortgage. Forecast for
tomorrow is a high of 78, with a low of 52.

We have breaking news from the sheriffâ€™s office: The
suspect has been identified in the brutal murders

of those four hikers and park
ranger in the Superstition Wilderness

Eric Kairis was born and raised in Salem, Oregon. He
was convicted of murder in 2017. He was the founding

member of the radical group â€™Give It Backâ€™, or
GIB. The group is responsible for over 20 deaths

in the past 2 years. Kairis was most recently a resident
of the largest psychiatric hospital in the state

of Oregon, until his escape 3 weeks ago.
The incident is still under investigation.

The four hikers were on vacation-

My name is Eric Kairis. Yes, I am the founder
of â€™Give it Backâ€™. Donâ€™t say GIB, I hate that!

It minimizes our credibility. For all of my
followers and believers, this video is... Canon.

They may have burned our physical network to
the ground, but they have only strengthened

our resolve and our cause.

Iâ€™m locked in this cage, like our brothers and sisters
around the world. But they will not contain me,

or our message. Humans have had control of our lands for far
too long. Blood is the only message they will understand.

They will not give it
back, we must take it!

They made it!

So nice to see you again.

Welcome children. Come into the light.

All are welcome.

And I want to thank you folks.

Can't say I didn't warn you.

Enjoy.
