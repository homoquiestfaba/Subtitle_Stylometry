Mr. Tynes.

He's ready for you.

Dodge Tynes.
Thanks for coming by.

Mr. Sellars,
thanks for seeing me.

My pleasure. Call me Miles.

I wish you could call me Dodge.
What a cool name.

Please, have a seat.

My dad was a car nut.
Worked the line.

Yeah, everyone's dad
in this town worked the line.

My old man welded floor pans.

When I was 14, he brought us

all the way here from Austria
looking for the American dream,

and damn it if Detroit
didn't give it to him.

-You're a Wings fan?
-Yeah.

Well, I got Yzerman's stick

hanging above my mantle
in my billiards room.

I used to have Gordie Howe's
jersey hanging in my closet.

Authentic? Game-worn?

Oh, yeah. Had to sell it.

Yeah, well...

I had a look
at your medical file;

seems like money's been tight
and luck's been bad.

I'm really sorry you're
going through this, Dodge.

Pain comes with the territory?

Yeah. Yeah, it usually
clears up pretty quick.

Sorry.

Uh...

Look, Miles,
I think you know my story.

If I just had some cash,

I could maybe get some treatment
to buy me more time,

and, uh,

maybe see my son be born.

That's the kind of conversation

-that requires alcohol.

Don't know if I should
in my condition.

In your condition,
you should drink

whatever the hell you want.

It's the good stuff, I promise.

See?

Yeah, I'd ask where you got it,

but I don't have the money
and I'll probably be dead

-before I finished the bottle.
-Come on, kid,

don't talk like that.

Pessimism's not gonna help you

or your wife. The good news is,
you're not the first person

to come to The Tiro Fund
in a tough spot.

You think a loan's possible?

I have a building for
collateral, The Carrington.

Well, Dodge,
I really want to help you,

and I think I can,

but I know The Carrington.
It's unfinished, unfunded.

I'd be the fourth
lienholder in line.

I just can't loan the kind of
money we're talking about

to someone who very likely
might pass away

before he can even think
about paying me back.

Now, I know that makes me sound
like a bastard.

I promise I'm not. It's just...

I lost family members to cancer.

I've seen how unforgiving
it can be.

Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

So, what, you still think
you can help me somehow?

I do.

But I can't do it alone.
I need your help,

your participation.

Participation, how?

Dodge, I am what you would
call a facilitator.

I make possible
the natural progression

of man's innate desire
to be challenged.

Right. Well, what does this
have to do with me?

You see, I represent
a very exclusive, very wealthy

clientele who pay exorbitant
fees for a unique,

one-of-a-kind experience

in a highly intense sport...

hunting.

And that's where your
participation becomes integral.

You'd want them to hunt me?

Like paintball?

Like tag or something?

Like you'd hunt an animal?

The sport in its purest form.

A hunt to kill.

Fuck me, you're serious.

Now I can see in your face you
want to just run out of here,

and you're welcome to do so,

only you'd be leaving
as poor as you came.

Or you can hear me out
and help your family

in a way that was unimaginable
five minutes ago.

You hunt innocent humans?

No, we hunt desperate humans,
with no glimmer of hope.

We provide optimism,
not just to people like you.

For the most part,
our hunters have snatched

all the brass rings
life can offer.

We give them a challenge.

They're not going after
paunchy 40-year-olds

with bad knees.

They battle physical specimens.

We satisfy their need to strive.

Not to mention
what you'd be doing for me.

-For you?
-I'd be helping you

and your wife
and your unborn child.

You know, really helping
a family in crisis.

What I do for a living

doesn't provide much opportunity
to feel good about myself.

No, I can't imagine it does.

Listen, I'm gonna go
to the cops.

To tell them what?
You'd sound deranged,

and you'd be able
to prove nothing.

We'll see.

You could leave
your family millions.

Dodge.

How many times

since your diagnosis have you
told yourself you'd do anything

to make sure your family's
secure after you're gone?

Well, this is your chance
to "do anything."

If you want to hear more,

I'll be finishing my drink
on the balcony.

Dodge Tynes coming on strong,

passing Vanderbilt's Wilson,
leaving Notre Dame behind.

They're all just spectators now.

He's breaking from the pack,

extending his lead
with every step.

Into the final turn.

Nothing but daylight
ahead of him.

Dodge Tynes wins the 400!

45.46 seconds,

a new University of Michigan
record.

Put it in the books.
Dodge Tynes.

The unrecruited walk-on
is nothing but a winner.

-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

-You want some breakfast?
-Ooh.

Why, thank you.

An omelet, blueberries,
toast, coffee.

Oh. Oh, God.

-No good?
-Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God.
-I thought eggs were okay.

-It's the butter.
-Oh, boy.

-Shit.

I'm sorry, babe. I thought
you were cool with dairy.

You okay?

I amokay with dairy.

It's little Thumper
that's not okay with dairy.

Or chicken or anything green.

Thank you.
That was sweet, though.

Thanks for the vomity kiss.
That's nice.

Hey, do you think we can
get to the crib this week?

I got to get that box
out of the foyer already.

-Yes. I'll do the crib.
-And the loose brick.

Every time you step on it,
it just comes right off.

The crib, the loose brick,
everything else,

it's all gonna get done once
I'm through with these pitches.

I know.
And you're gonna be great.

You're always great.

Hey. Don't hide things
from me, okay?

I found the bills.

I wasn't hiding them from you,

I just want you to focus
on your job.

I'm focused. Okay?
And I have some great leads.

And I'm gonna get the financing.

I got to go.

Hey.

$1,238.48.

That's what we had
when we got married.

Negative $220,

our net worth when we bought
this shell of a house

and renovated it
from the ground up.

We built a life together.

We're gonna be fine.

Yeah, I know.

$220,000 in debt.

-The good old days, huh?

I love you.

Mr. Pierce,
I appreciate your time.

So, let me get
right to it, all right?

Your building?
It's a sinking ship.

All right? Matter of fact,
it's already underwater

and filled with holes.

But that doesn't mean
it can't be salvaged.

Distressed asset investment.

That's what put all this marble
under our feet.

-So...
-Exactly. And as you can see

-from the prospectus...
-I don't invest

in something based on drawings
about how something could be.

I only invest based
on what something is now.

So please, bring me back
the real numbers, all right?

Warts and all.
And give me your best shot.

All right?
Bring me those numbers.

I got to go.

To the future Prince Tynes.

Lucky bastard.
Three times, all girls.

Even the dog is female.

And you find out
yours has a wang. Unfair.

Please. You love being
surrounded by Daddy's girls.

I do, but sometimes
I just want someone

to watch football and fart with.

Oh, you won't do that
with him, Janice?

Seriously, man, what a blessing.

You've got an heir
to the throne.

I'll be right back.

Hey, when you pee in my alley,
the bums get confused

because they already marked
their territory.

All right, man,
what's the problem?

How am I supposed to have
an heir to the throne

when all I have to pass on
is a mountain of debt?

D, I know things are bad.

I put everything I had
in The Carrington.

Not to mention
what other people had, too.

Hey, I'm not some investor
whose money you lost.

I'm your best friend...

whose money you lost.

It's not funny, man.
It's killing me.

I'm not thrilled about it,
either.

I mean, I don't know
if you noticed,

but this place is not
exactly a gold mine.

50K is a lot of money to me,

but I only want it back
when you can swing it.

Look at her. Van Buren Motors.

Back in the day,
when that sign was all lit up,

you could see it
from anywhere in the city.

You remember that summer,

when your old man
had us working the Paint Room?

Yeah, we brought Penny,
uh, P-Penny

-what's her, what's her name?
-Penny Talesco.

-Penny Talesco.
-And Tammy Polnechek.

My dad catches us smoking

his Chesterfields
in the underground tunnels.

Yeah, I thought he was
gonna have a coronary.

Well, yeah.

If any paint fumes had gotten
in those tunnels,

we would've blown up
half the factory.

-Stupid.

Yeah, but fun.

Look, man,
better times are coming.

Just hang in there.

Now I got to go check
on the kegs.

-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

-Yeah?
-I'm okay.

If I have to come back out here,

you got to name
your baby Looger.

-Mrs. Tynes.
-Where is my husband?

I found him on my beat.
Doctors can tell you more,

but right now he's alert
and okay.

I'll take you to him.

This way.

He's right in there.

Thank you.

-What happened?
-Hey. I'm okay.

I'm okay.

Police called.
I was so scared.

DR.
Mr. and Mrs. Tynes?

This is Dr. Carlton Levy
and I'm Dr. Rajiv Singhal.

So, uh, what the hell's
going on?

One minute I'm at the bus,
next minute I wake up in here.

Mr. Tynes,
have you been experiencing

any headaches lately?

Yeah.

Yeah, pretty bad ones.

Well, this is your CT.

This mass is a,
it's a glioblastoma,

an aggressive tumor.

It's malignant and,
because of its location,

inoperable.

Uh, this has to be wrong.

He runs, like,
six miles every day.

Mrs. Tynes,
we're lucky to have Dr. Levy

as a visiting attending.

He's one of the top
oncological surgeons

at Sloan Kettering.

We both concur on the diagnosis.

DR.
I wish we were wrong,
but unfortunately,

we're not.

I don't care what they say.

We'll see every
specialist there is,

go to the Mayo Clinic, Cedars...

With what, Val?
I have no insurance.

-Yes, you do.
-No. No, you and the baby do.

I took myself
off the policy months ago.

Why would you do that?

Because we have no money, Val.

I'm all right. I'm all right.

Listen, man, I'm, uh,

I'm real sorry you're
going through all this.

Here.

There's this company always
leaving those at the hospital.

They say they help
sick people in trouble.

Maybe they can help you.

Weeks? Weeks?

Val and I haven't
had enough time together.

I'm angry.

I'm angry I'm gonna die.

I'm angry my son won't know me.

I'm angry this

fucking tumor's taking me
from my family.

There's options, you know, um,

holistic stuff.

I was watching TV the other day
and this guy said

if you drink aloe, it does
something to the pH in your body

and it kills the cancer, or, um,

tents where you
sweat out the toxins,

or, I don't know,

there's healing crystals,

or Reiki, or acupuncture.

I just think...
You know, we try other stuff.

We don't, we don't just
accept this. There's options.

In my experience,
it's best if I talk for a while

and you just listen
with an open mind.

Can you do that for me, Dodge?

So here's how you'll be hunted.

It's a 24-hour hunt.

Every hour you survive,

more money is being wired
into your bank account,

and that continues
until the game ends.

You survive the day,
you walk away rich.

Don't...

you die a few weeks earlier

than you would've anyway,
but you leave your family

set for life.

I can't believe we're actually
having this conversation.

Well, after you called
my office, I researched you.

Local boy made good,
turning the city around.

Track star at Michigan,
solid citizen. Dodge,

if I could wave a wand making
you well, believe me, I would.

But that wand doesn't exist,
and if it did,

you couldn't afford it.

Is this how you find
participants?

Lying to hospitals, telling them
you can help their patients?

I can help you,
and that thrills me.

Might come as a surprise,

but I didn't grow up thinking
this would be my calling.

I wanted to play goalie
for the Red Wings.

Look, usually I'm dealing
with trust fund babies

blowing inheritances,
or degenerate gamblers.

I got a guy with
a six-figure coke habit

on my call sheet right now.

Dodge,

you're the first
terminal person we've found

who's actually fit enough
to be a runner.

You're just a good man
who caught a bad hand.

Well, if I'm a good man,
what's that make you?

Your only hope.

If you want to consider this,
there are rules,

most important of which is:
once you commit, that's it.

No time-outs, no do-overs.

My clients want to make
absolutely sure

you know exactly
what you're getting into.

They want a fair hunt.

Mm. What gentlemen.

Oh, don't assume they're men.

Hunters can be men, women,
Black, white, butcher, baker,

candlestick maker--
anyone you run into

could be the last person
you ever see.

Next rule: the game takes place
in Detroit only.

If you leave
the city's confines,

that's a violation,
and then the game never ends.

It continues
until you're killed.

Go to the cops or get yourself
arrested, that's a violation.

You tell anyone what's going on,
that's a violation.

It's just you
and the five hunters

we've lined up for this run.

No I.D., no cash, no help;
just you on your own.

And the money part?

Good, that means
you're intrigued.

Top of the first hour,

$50,000 is wired

into your bank from an
untraceable offshore account.

Next hour, $100,000.

Deposits increase 50 grand
every hour until hour 20,

which pays a million,

and that increases by a million
every hour after that,

culminating in the final hour,

which pays $5 million

-for a grand total of...
-$24.5 million.

Yes, exactly why
you'll be great at this game.

Smart, athletic, you know the
terrain better than the hunters.

You can pull this off.

A few more things
you need to know:

no guns.

Hunters need to get
up close and personal.

They're gonna get
real creative with this.

You have to carry this
at all times.

It can only call me.

Every time you make it
through another hour--

so right after your money's
deposited-- it chimes twice,

giving up your exact location

for the next 15 seconds.

After that, you go dark again.

Don't think you can drop it
on a bus and take off.

We find the cell and not you?
That's a violation.

It'll make you a permanent
player in the game.

Enough so you know I'm for real,

not enough to make a dent
in your problems.

Suit yourself.

But if you change your mind...

here's my personal number.

Hopefully, I'll see you soon.

I'll see you in hell first.

No.

You'll get to go to Heaven,
Dodge, when you die.

So, even utilizing
a vacancy rate of 2.6%,

we're still looking at returns
well above the mean.

This variable-cost model
allows for a return of capital

greater than comparable
investments in Columbus,

Grand Rapids, Peoria
and St. Louis.

Okay, Dodge.

-Yes, sir, you have a question?
-No, no, I think I have

a pretty good picture
of what we're looking at here.

But I do have to say,

my friend,
you could sell salt to a slug.

-Thank you.

But I'm sorry to say,
you can't sell this one to me.

I really wanted the numbers
to work, but they don't.

But maybe we could do something
in the future, okay?

Maybe I could rework the offer?

Oh, no, there's no need,

but thank you.
It's-it's a definite pass.

All right, my friend.

What if I give you 75% equity?

You could give me
the whole damn building,

wouldn't make a difference.

I don't want the debt
that goes along with it.

Look, bring me
your next project, okay?

There is no next project, sir.
I need this to work.

My-my family and I are going
through something right now,

and this...
this building is all I got.

Well, I went through something
similar when I started out,

but trust me,
it's never as bad as it seems.

You're gonna bounce back, kid.

All right, be in touch.

You know what I don't like
about this?

The dying part?

What I don't like is what
a little bitch you're being.

When you tore up
your ankle at regionals,

you trained your ass off,
came back, and won state.

And when that prick

associate professor
tried to steal Val-- Hey.

Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

When that prick tried to steal

Val away,
you knocked him in the dirt.

You're a lousy singer,
an average card player,

and the best friend I got,
so you fight,

like you always do.

I got no money, no insurance.

My parents are dead.
Val's family's broke.

What exactly do I fight with?

You got a son on the way, so you
fight with everything you got.

Hey.

Where'd you go?

I took a walk to clear my head.

Uh...

I have something to tell you.

An offer was made to me.

Jerry Pierce
wants to close financing.

So we're gonna have money
coming in,

and we're gonna use it
for the most aggressive drugs

out there, experimental
surgeries, whatever it takes.

I did some research and there's
doctors that have developed

-procedures that they...
-Oh, my God.

Listen,

I'm not ready to let go yet,

so I'm gonna fight.

I'm gonna fight for all three of
us, and I'm not gonna give up.

Are we gonna be okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I promise.

MILES
Hello, Dodge.

How'd you know it was me?

You're the only person

outside my team
who has this number.

How can I help you?

I'm in.

I love you.

Where you going?

I'm just going for a run.

Go back to sleep, okay?

Cutting it close.

Game's from sunrise to sunrise.

Daybreak's at46.

-Here. I ordered those for you.
-I'm not hungry.

No, you should eat.

-You need fuel in your tank.
-I'm fine.

Oh, suit yourself, but it's

tough going out there
when you're on the run.

I run every day.

Not like this you don't.

Empty your pockets.

Is there a problem?

I'm just thinking
maybe I should go home.

To what?

A wife who can
watch you die penniless?

A family that'll be homeless
in a matter of months?

Dodge, we both know
you're too good a man

to leave them like that
just because you're scared.

Wait, hold on.

The ultrasound.

Oh, fair enough.

Keep those.

If you're debilitated,
you can't provide a good game.

Get up.

What?

Come on, on your feet.

It'll only take a second.

Arms out.

I got to pat you down.
My apologies,

-but it's a requirement.
-People are watching.

Yeah, they think
you're on parole

and I'm your probation officer.

Great.

I had a guy in San Juan

smuggle a knife in his sock.

In the end it did him no good,
but my clients were

rightfully upset that the game
was compromised.

How many people have you roped
into this shit?

Considering the stakes,

-more than you'd imagine.

Considering the state of the
world, fewer than you'd expect.

Yeah, it's me. Yeah.

Wire $50,000 into the
player's account, please.

I-I'll wait.

Do you guys have a name
for the baby?

Yeah? Thanks.

Open the dollar sign app.

This is my bank account.
How...

Look at the balance.

For the first hour, whether you
live through it or not.

Now you know the setup works.

"I'll love you both forever."

Don't look at the clock,
look at me.

I want you to get through this.

I want you to have a shot
at holding that kid of yours,

or at least leave him something,
so listen to me carefully.

What you want to do
is keep moving.

Crowds are your friend.

Hunters don't want
to kill you too publicly,

or they wind up spending
the rest of their lives

in prison under the fake
identities we set up for them.

Trust no one, keep your head
on a swivel, stay paranoid.

-Got it?
-Yeah. Yeah, okay.

Yeah. When do you
tell the hunters?

Well, they're in here
with us now, all five of them.

What?

Yeah, that's right,
it could be anyone.

Dodge, Dodge.

Adrenaline
is flushing your system,

your heart rate's going like
you're making the final turn

in the quarter mile-- you got to
get this shit in check,

or you won't make it past noon.

Yeah.

When does it start?

It just did.

You get a three-minute
head start.

You can use it to take in as
many faces as you can, but for

all you know, the hunters have
already slipped out the back.

Or you can run your ass off.

There are three Fs, kid:

fight, flight or freeze.

The third one gets you killed.

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm sorry.

Fare? $1.50.

Shit. I lost my wallet.

Step off the bus, sir.

Come on, man,
you've seen me before.

You know I have a monthly.

Just this one time.

Thanks.

Hold the bus!

Hey, let's go!

Come on, man, this thing runs

-on a schedule. Let's move it.
-Don't you tell me

how to drive my damn bus.

Thanks, man.

Mind moving over?

Stop the bus!

Stop the bus.

I need to get off.
Stop the bus.

You need to stay
behind the yellow line, sir.

Stop the fucking bus!

-Get your crazy ass off my bus.

Let's see what
you bloodsuckers want.

Deposit?

Hmm.

Oh, my God.

Oh. I'm sorry, your husband

can't come to the phone
right now.

He's busy playing a game.

DODGE
You've reached Dodge Tynes
of Tynes Construction.

Leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

Hi, hon.

I know you said we'd have
some money coming in,

but we just had 50 grand
deposited into our account.

Kind of crazy Jerry Pierce
would get to us so soon.

Call me back. Love you.

Oh. Yeah, Connell?

Your boy isn't doing well.
He's panicking.

Are you questioning
my selection?

I am not.

Good. Dodge is an athlete.

He'll give a good hunt.

I'm certain you're correct;
however, you should be aware

Carter is right on Tynes' trail.

He's hardly 50 yards behind him.

Come on, Dodge,
don't make me look bad.

Crowds are your friend.

What the hell am I supposed
to do with these?

Just let me sit here a minute.

Get out of my chair
before I kick your ass.

Hey, hey!

Newspaper's a dollar!

Hold the door!

Thanks.

Okay, just breathe.

Regulate your heart rate.

Stay hydrated.

You're okay, you're okay.

So...

Mr. Tynes?

Shall we?

I was told that you were
a competitor, Mr. Tynes.

A fighter.

Someone with something
to live for.

But sadly...

it appears that
you're nothing more...

than a waste of my time...

my energy...

and my resources.

I have to say...

that I'm disappointed.

-Nixon.
-Mr. Sellars,

I traveled a quarter of the way
around the globe

for a hunt
that's lasted less than an hour.

This is Johannesburg
all over again.

We'll need to discuss
your refund policy.

I apologize.

I-It's not the quality
of product you deserve,

nor is it what The Tiro Fund
strives to provide.

I'll make it right
on the next hunt.

You have my word.

Sorry, Dodge.

Okay. Now we...

Sir?

Tynes has exited the bathroom.

In a body bag.

Not at this speed, he's not.

He's alive.

Attaboy, Dodge.

You've reached the Tynes.
Please leave a message.

Dodge, it's Jerry Pierce.

Um, I couldn't get you
on the cell,

so I figured I'd try you
at home, and--

Look, I feel bad about
saying no to The Carrington,

but I had a thought.

How about you project manage
for me?

Now, I know it's not the same
as running your own company,

but I would love to have
a guy like you on my team.

So, please, give me a call.

What the hell?

Shit.

14 wolverine, 13 wolverine...

Okay, gang, today we're
gonna be doing a half mile

-down to the post office
and back to the bakery.
-11 wolverine, ten wolverine,

nine wolverine, eight wolverine,

-seven wolverine...
-Dodge,

there's 150 grand
in our bank account.

...five wolverine...

I know Jerry Pierce

didn't come in on our building.

Where are you? Call me.

...one wolverine.

What is he saying?

Hey, son, are you all right?

No.

Now, you squirm

or holler,

some of these good folks
might get hurt, too.

And they didn't agree
to partake in no hunt.

Let's go for a little walk.

Looger, it's Val.

Are you with Dodge?

Okay, listen,

we just had $150,000
sent to us this morning.

Dodge said it was from this deal
that I just learned

doesn't exist, and now
I can't get in touch with him.

No, Looger, I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

I think he's in trouble.

There you go.
Nice and easy...

to the escalator over there.

We're gonna ride on up
to the mezzanine,

then out to the loading docks.

How that sound?

Come on, now.

Reagan.

Limey son of a bitch.

Impressive.

It seems Mr. Tynes
escaped Nixon and Reagan

just a few minutes apart.

I told you
he'd give a good hunt.

You did, sir.

Well,

I'm off to follow our players.

-Watch it!

Fuck.

Everything okay down there?

Saw you fall
from across the street.

Yes.

Uh, he's fine.
Thank you, Officer.

Not talking to you. Talking
to the guy with the bloody beak.

Yeah, I'm okay, sir.

Maybe don't run
like a maniac next time.

Yeah, you must forgive
my friend, Officer.

He's, uh... he's late
for his wife's ultrasound.

Today...

is the day
they find out the gender.

It really is a very exciting
day, isn't it, mate?

Yeah.

All right.

Congrats on the kid.

Get that nose checked out.

Okay.

Hey!

That tea-sipping nancy boy
ain't here to save you now,

is he, son?

Next stop, Fort/Cass Station.

Fuckin' Detroit, right?

Look here, Benny Hill.

I was actively engaged
back there.

You interfered with my kill.

Violated the rules of the hunt.

First, I know the rules
of the hunt better than anyone.

You had merely trapped the prey
in a public setting,

which negates any possibility
of active engagement.

Now, if I come upon you
and the prey on the loading dock

behind the building,
which was private and secure,

then, yes, you would have been
in active engagement

and any interference on my part
would have been a violation.

But that was not the case.

And, second,

you will remove your hands
from my suit immediately,

or I will remove
your left testicle

from the inside of your body.

Whatever you say, Mr. Belvedere.

The kid left Reagan and Nixon
holding their jocks,

twice.

Our other hunters?

All in the vicinity.

Dodge may feel safe
on that train,

but that's not gonna last.

Shit!

Sorry if I startled you.

Father...

Sorry, yeah,
you kind of scared me.

Not my intention.

Are you here for confession?

Sure.

Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

It's been a while
since my last confession.

If I'm being honest, Father...

I'm afraid that
I've willingly engaged

in something that is...

inherently evil.

And now I can't get out of it.

Let's see.

Well, it's got
a foreign account code.

But they don't give the source.

And with international
banking laws and all...

I'm sorry, do you not know
how you got this money?

-No, that's...
-Uh, it's her uncle's estate.

He was very wealthy;
holdings all over the place.

So we're just
trying to figure out

where exactly
the money's coming from.

You know, we don't want her
cousins finding out about a new

account, and then making claims
on assets they don't deserve.

Yeah. Uh...
they weren't the ones

changing the old man's diapers
the past two years.

I'm gonna get my manager
to take a look at this.

It's strange, the deposits
seem to be coming

in regular intervals--
46 minutes after every hour.

50,000...

100,000...

150,000...

150?

Yes, at46 this morning.

Are you not aware
of this last deposit?

We just... had no idea

how much Uncle Jimmy
actually had.

Well...
I'm gonna get my manager.

It's okay. Uh, everything
seems to be in order.

Thank you for your time.

What are you doing?

300 grand?

Dodge is into some
serious shit, okay?

And the last thing we need

is someone looking
into it before we can

figure out what's going on.

Thought I had no choice.

You know, I couldn't just
leave my family with nothing.

Wanting to provide for
your loved ones is not a sin.

Yeah.

Howyou decide to do it...

-it can be.

-What exactly are you doing?

Dealing drugs, stealing?

No, no.

I'd never do something
that could hurt someone else.

Ironically, the only person
that could get hurt is me.

Okay, well, call me
if you have any information.

Thanks.

Anything?

Hospitals
and morgues have no one

fitting his description,
so I guess that's good.

You called the police?

We don't know
what Dodge is doing.

I thought we agreed we were
gonna keep him out of trouble.

He's already in trouble.

My son, I cannot provide you
with the sacrament of penance

unless you confess
your specific misdeed

and express your heartfelt
sorrow for having committed it.

Thing is...

the rules say
I can't tell anyone.

If I tell you,
and you go to the cops...

I'm forbidden from breaching

the confidentiality
of confession.

Church canon dictates that
I cannot betray your trust.

Father, if I told you...

you wouldn't believe me.

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey!

Stop that this instant!

He's trying to kill me!

I was, I was just
waiting my turn! Fuck.

You just violated
the sanctity of my church.

Now, sit down
and tell me exactly why

you think people
are trying to kill you.

Because I agreed to it.

Does your husband have a history
of depression in his family?

No.

Suicide?

No.

Sorry, I-I got to ask.

Often people who are sick,

they want to go out
on their own terms.

It's okay.

Sorry, I have to ask this.

Um, and for your husband's sake,
I need you to tell the truth.

Was he involved
in anything illegal?

Drugs, financial crimes,
anything that could

help explain the deposits
you've been receiving?

The idea that
my husband would be involved

in anything illegal is absurd.

Okay.

Uh, my situation is this:

I can't even file a missing
person's report for 24 hours,

so my hands are tied, but, uh...

Look, I'll poke around,
talk to some people.

But I got to be honest,
I'm grasping right now.

My husband is a good man.

Please, if there's
anything you can do...

Yeah, of course.

I got less than a minute,
Father-- I got to go.

Why? What's so urgent
at45 on a weekday

that you need to run off instead
of tell me your problems?

45 isn't when things
get urgent, Father.

It's46-- that's when
they'll know where I am.

Who? Who will know?

Look... I can't say.

Whoever it is,

I promise I won't
let them hurt you.

Not in my house.

Not in the Lord's house.

Ah, shit, you see?

Now they know where I am.

Actually, Dodge,

I've known where you are
for some time now.

Looks like it's over.

Carter's got him pinned.

Three hours, one minute. Oh.

Still below average,
but considering he's got away

from Reagan and Nixon,
you can't say

-it was not a formidable hunt.

Connell, you're at that church?

Have been for a while.

Yeah, get ready for a cleanup.

The gates are wrought iron.

There's no pulling them open!

Now, why would I lock one gate,
but not the others?

That would be illogical.

Lord, I hate dumb prey.

I have a psychology degree
from the University of Ibadan,

master's in behavioral studies
from Oxford.

That is how
I was able to find you.

You see, an hour ago,

when I got your location,
I was nowhere near you,

but the entire 15 seconds
that you were exposed,

you headed north.

I saw you were a few blocks

from St. Jerome's.

And though I know you are

a lapsed Catholic
from your file,

church is still
something familiar, eh?

When scared,

we subconsciously run
towards the familiar.

It soothes us.

I knew you wouldn't
immediately go inside.

Fear of being trapped
the way Nixon had you confined

in the Renaissance Center, eh?

But, eventually,
you would seek sanctuary.

I got here before you,
locked up,

borrowed some clothes
from the rectory,

and here we are--

you, me...

and my father's 20-ounce
steel shaft rip claw.

Why didn't you just kill me
in confession?

I wanted to see if you'd break
the rules and expose the hunt.

I didn't say anything.
I followed the rules.

Yes. You play with honor.

That is why
I'm going to kill you quickly.

Come on, man.
I have a family.

I know that
from your profile, too.

You put up a valiant fight.

You should be proud.

Goodbye, Mr. Tynes.

This is my favorite part.

The gates are wrought iron.
There's no pulling them open.

If I were you,
I'd get those prayer candles

and burn this church
to the ground,

'cause if you leave me alive,
trust me when I say

you will see me real soon!

You said you read my file.
What file?

Background on potential prey.

As a psychologist, I find it
helpful with my tracking.

Troglodytes like Reagan
don't ever read them.

I'm not even sure he can read.

Reagan?

You said Nixon earlier.

And I'm Carter.

Miles gives us pseudonyms
to protect the hunt.

I like the name "Carter"
because of his work

with Habitat for Humanity.

They use tools... just like me.

You asked for this, Mr. Tynes!

You said so yourself!

-Oh, fuck.

Hey, hey, my brother.

I-I'm sorry, but I believe
that is my hammer.

Huh?

Hey! Stealing from the church?

Oh, you know that is bad juju,
man! Bad juju!

I'm coming for you.

Mr. Tynes!

I am coming for you.

How the hell did he get out
of the church,

and Carter isn't moving?

Connell?

Did he kill Carter?

No, he...

incapacitated him.

Oh, yeah,
just let me out of here.

That would be interfering
with the hunt.

But... this is what you'll do.

When you're discovered,

you'll say
you're a priest from Nigeria

staying with family in Detroit.

You decided to see the church,

and came upon vandals
robbing the donations box.

They beat you and locked you up.

Hey, it could be hours
till I'm found.

Yes.

Good day.

The situation's handled, sir.

Oh, I got to go.
It's the runner.

Dodge, you continue to impress.

You gave them a file on me?

Carter used it to find me.

Well, yeah, after we met,

I had my team do a little recon
on you.

It's all part of the hunt.

Yeah. Yeah, well,
the hunt's on hold, asshole.

That psycho Carter took a chunk
out of my leg.

Yeah, I'm afraid
that's a "you" problem.

Fuck you. I thought
you wanted a fair hunt.

I explained the rules to you.
No do-overs, no time-outs.

If you're injured, I suggest
you tend to your wounds.

Well, keep up the good work,
kid.

I'm rooting for you.

H-Hello?

Ah, you prick.

Yeah, great. Just great.

Ah, fuck!

Fuck! Aah!

Oh, fuck. I can't run.

I can't fucking run.

Hmm.

Interesting.

Mr. Sellars.

Is Connell in place?

Well, Connell is never
too far from the prey,

but will not be seen
by you or any hunter,

unless he wants to be seen.

Now, I assume you ask because

you think you have
a beat on Tynes?

The expression is "have a bead,"

Mr. Sellars, not a beat.

And, no, I cannot
have a bead on him,

because a bead is the metal
protuberance on the end

of a gun barrel,
which helps a shooter aim.

And, we're not permitted
to use guns to take our prey.

Condescending asshole.

Now, I see you're
at the corner of, uh,

Lafayette and Chrysler,
just outside Greektown.

And I've been tracking Dodge
for the past several hours.

Each hour, he's moved
closer to downtown,

but he's covering
less ground each time.

He's an athlete--
he wouldn't be getting

this tired
so soon into the game.

I've concluded that he's hurt.

Well, I can neither
confirm nor deny.

I wasn't asking you to.
I would never attempt

to glean non-permitted
information.

I always play by the rules.

Apologies.
It was not my intent

to suggest otherwise.

Be that as it may,

this call is a courtesy.

You might want to get
your ducks in a row.

It will be46 soon.

I believe the GPS
will show Dodge to be close.

And he won't
get away from me twice.

Well, he is kind of close.

Dodge, you're picking
the wrong time to catch a game.

Here's Clutterbuck
right into the middle

and Bernier had to come up
with a big stop!

He also got belted.

Right out of the box,
back in for Bertuzzi.

Sends it rink wide.
Dylan Larkin

-able to keep that puck in.
-What's the score?

Three-two, Islanders.
We have no offense.

How much time left?

Uh, couple of minutes.

It's gonna be close.

Huh?

Nothing.

You mind if I hang out
and listen for a while?

Nah. Move along.

You guys are always trying
to five-finger my inventory.

"You guys"?

I'm not homeless.

I was in an accident.
It's a long story.

Come on, man,
I just want to hear the game.

Suit yourself.

Thanks.

Hey, you wouldn't have
anything to drink, would you?

I'm dying of thirst.

Only sell merch.

Want to buy a program?

Well, I got no cash.

Be happy I don't
charge you to listen.

Come on, Detroit!

Cops said stay by the phone,
but no one's calling.

It's almost sunset.

What if he's
in a ditch somewhere?

I reached out
to everyone we know.

No one's heard from him.

Is the money still coming in?

Yeah, over 2.2 million.

Jesus. How?

I don't know.
He knew a million money guys

with access
to that kind of cash.

I'm gonna check his records.

Okay, well,
I'm gonna do another lap

around the neighborhood,
'cause I'm losing my mind

just sitting here.

You want Janice
to come back over?

Uh... no.

I want to be alone.

Okay.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Just call me
if you find anything.

Another save by Greiss!
Detroit down by one,

with an empty net
and a man advantage.

Oh! Larkin rang one
off the crossbar,

-missing a goal by inches!
-Yes.

What, are you from New York?

No. No, I'm from here.

30 seconds left in the game.
New York can't

-get the puck
out of their own end!
-I'll see you later, man.

Oh! Bertuzzi just misses

-on the glove side!
-Come on!

Put the puck in the back
of the damn net!

It's desperation time now.

A flurry of activity, but still

not getting close to the goal.

It's moments like these where
you really feel the anxiety

because you know
you're running out of time.

Larkin drops it back
to Kronwall... slapshot!

Blocked by Hickey,
picked up by Boychuk!

-He fires it down the ice

just as the horn sounds!

Detroit loses a nail-biter,
three to two!

Here we go.

Nine wolverine,
eight wolverine...

Seven...

six...

Five wolverine...

four wolverine...

three wolverine...

two wolverine, one wolverine.

Dodge!

Dodge, I know you're here, mate!

You can't run anymore,
so now you hide.

Right in plain sight.

You clever, clever boy.

Dodge!

Oh, Dodge Tynes!

Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

-Hey, take the jersey off. Hey!
-All right, all right,
just keep it down.

Hey, take it off, you thief!
Take it off!

Just keep it down.

Take it off!

Oh, come on.

-Could you hurry up?
-No, because you never took

-the laundry out of the trunk.
-Let's just get them

in the car seats and then
we'll finish loading up.

Ooh.

That's gonna be
a cold one tonight, Dodge.

Yeah, Connell?

Yeah, I saw the speed
on the monitor.

I assume he's on a bus.

In a car?

Dodge, you have no idea
what you're doing.

Okay, Mikey's got
"Bingo" on repeat.

Davey's got his juice.

And before you know it,
we'll be back in Birmingham.

The game takes place
in Detroit only.

You leave the city's confines,

that's a violation,
and then the game never ends.

Shit.

Don't be such a grump.

You know the words,
just sing the song.

-Shh. Quiet.

-I think I hear something.

What the hell is that?

I think it's coming
from the trunk.

You're getting off the freeway?

I mean, it's not exactly
the best neighborhood.

-What is it?
-How should I know?

Do you think it's like
a raccoon or something?

I think I'll know in a second.

-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Holy shit!

Are we still in the city limits?

How did you get in my car?

-Are we still in Detroit?
-We have a homeless man
accosting us

-on 6 Mile Road!
-Hey! No-no-no,
you can't call the cops!

Hey, hey, come on, stop!

Ah!

Give me your phone.

Give me your fucking phone!

Please. Don't hurt them.

I'm so...

I'm sorry.

Hey! Where do you think
you're going?!

I'm going home.

Stolen taxi reported
just off 6 Mile.

Suspect description
matches our runner.

Yeah, he's ten hours
into the game.

He's mentally exhausted.
It's a calculated risk.

He knows cops aren't putting
a stolen cab

-on the top of their to-do list.
-Agreed.

But there was another report
of a vagrant

assaulting a family,
not far from the car theft.

Suspect description
also matches our runner.

Assaulting a family?

Well, the hunt broke
a Panamanian general

in ColÃ³n City four years ago;

why wouldn't
the same thing happen

to a real estate developer
in Detroit?

Sir?

Tynes isn't using any evasive
or deceptive driving techniques.

It appears he has a very
specific destination in mind.

Looger, I know
every supplier, vendor,

contractor Dodge works with.

None of them are named
Miles Sellars.

"Assurance For Those
Without Insurance"?

He has no insurance!

Hang on a sec.

I just saw Dodge!

Ah, shit.

-Ah!

So predictable.

I knew you'd run back home
to see your wife

once the reality sunk in.

Reality of what
your new normal was.

Of what you have become.

But there's one thing
you could never become.

You could never become a killer.

You couldn't do it in the church
and you can't do it now.

You know if you let me live,
I will come back after you,

and yet you still cannot deliver
the fatal blow.

Perhaps...

I will see you
on the street, eh?

Or in an alley?

Or back home.

Eh, with your wife.

Maybe I'll go right there
once I extricate myself.

Wait there for you again, eh?

With your lovely bride, Valerie.

She and I will have much fun.

I will scar her so bad,
you will never forget me.

I will break her like I...

You're dead!

Hello?

Hello?

The body?

Steel coffin filled with lye

at the bottom of Lake St. Clair.

Along with
the DNA-covered cinderblock.

Uh-huh. Motorcycle?

Wiped down.
Serial numbers removed.

-The cab?
-I left it.

It was reported stolen,
so this was the end of a...

drunken joy ride.

Torched it to be safe.

Good job.

Got to be honest,

I didn't think Dodge
had it in him.

You should...
you should get back on his tail.

He's been wandering for hours.

When his location's
been revealed,

his concealment efforts
have been weak.

He's lucky he hasn't been found.

It's first-kill shell shock.

Well... very likely,

but he might not be long
for the game.

So, prep for Wrap-Up.

May I have a water, please?

No water.
Coke, Dr Pepper or Sprite.

Dr Pepper.

One dollar.

Please, man, I'm so thirsty.

Get lost. You smackheads
are ruining the city.

Beat it.

Just give me a soda!

All right, all right.

Try that again,
I'll whip your ass sober!

All right. Yeah.

-I need a ticket, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

Excuse me.
How long is this thing?

Oh, it's a 40-minute
shoreline tour of the city.

There are headphones available
that provide a history

of Detroit,
from Motown to motorcars.

Perfect. Thank you.

Sorry, are you all right?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

Well, the buffet starts in ten.

The captain will announce
when it's ready.

Free buffet?

That's great.

Yeah, keep looking, asshole.

I'm gonna get some ribs.

Ah-ah-ah.
I thought I told you,

the buffet starts
in ten minutes.

Sorry, I'm just really thirsty.

Yeah, well...

the hunt'll do that
to you, Dodge.

Oh, fuck me.

Hey, Dodge!

Do you like this game?

Not my favorite.

Well, you better
get used to it, 'cause...

once we go under that bridge,
we're in Canadian waters.

And then the game never ends.

You got to be shittin' me.

He was trapped on a boat.

-With Kennedy.
-With Kennedy. And there he is,

the only one walking
out of the ring. Huh.

But how long can he keep it up?

Hours will pass.

Midnight will come and go.

His movement will lose purpose

and then cease
for long stretches

as exhaustion sets in.

When his location's given up,
he'll barely react.

The irony is,

when he's just a few
scant hours from freedom,

after all he's been through...

...he'll be incapable
of believing

it'll ever come to an end.

I'm sorry, Val.

Get in!

Bro, that's, like, a month old.

Look, I don't know what
you got yourself caught up in,

but whatever it is,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

How the hell did you find me?

Driving all night.

And then I remembered you used
to go to that playground to hide

when your dad got sick.

But never mind how I found you--

what the hell is going on?

Can't tell you.

Just drive me around
for the next 57 minutes,

-and then I got to go.
-Why?

Why 57 minutes?

Is somebody after you?
'Cause of that money?

Yes. Yes on both counts.

Look, I'm just doing
what you told me to, man.

I'm fighting.

Fighting with everything I got.

Ah, shit.

-You got to lose this guy.
-Who is it?

It doesn't matter.
He'll kill both of us.

Just drive.

Up here. Hug the turn
as close as you can get.

And, Looger,
promise me something.

-Yeah?
-Don't follow me.

Dodge!

Hey, man, you got five bucks?

Shit.

Damn right.

What the hell happened, Looger?

I had him in my truck,
and he jumped out.

I wrecked, and by the time
I came to, he was gone.

He jumped out of a moving truck?

Someone was chasing us.
Okay, I don't know who,

but he is
up-to-his-eyelids deep in it.

They beat him up pretty bad.

-Oh, my God.
-He's dealing
with dangerous people,

which is why I called.

It'll be safest here.

I can't believe
this is happening.

I'm telling you,
you got to let me go,

or things
are gonna jump off in here

in ways you can't understand.

Oh, I understand real good.

I understand
only two kinds of white folk

come into my projects-- cops...

and dealers.

You ain't no cop.

I'm not a dealer, either.

Really? 'Cause you got
all them pockets,

but you only had
two things on you.

This.

And, uh...

this.

And you only have one app
on that phone.

And when I opened it...

well, you have much money
going into your account--

I'm talking buckets of duckets.

Hey, yo, KG,
how much you add up, baby?

Over 15 million.

Goddamn!

Now, look...

I don't know much,

but I know you a payday.

You see that phone?

It says44.

In two minutes,
it's gonna chime,

and if I don't get out of here,

all hell's gonna break loose.

One of them's already here.

Yo, Casper be trippin', man.

One of who? Who you know
got that kind of green?

'Cause my connection
didn't tell me

they were sending nobody up
to come see me,

so you got to be working
for them other boys

trying to hustle their
fake-ass product into Motown.

Now, if them boys
want their man back...

they gonna have to pay.

Fake-ass product? What
the hell are you talking about?

What, my pain pills?

Bitch, these ain't shit.

I popped 'em, snorted 'em--

ain't nothin' but aspirin.

What? No, th-they're real.

Real-ass bullshit.

Listen to me, all right?

In less than a minute,

there is gonna be
some coldhearted killers

coming down here in force.

You get between me and them,

-they'll take you out, too.
-Hear me, son.

I'm getting that money.

Now, you can either help me
get it easy,

or you can help me get it
after you feel some true pain.

All right, have it your way.

You don't want to let me go?

There's a British guy
with an ice pick,

a redneck with a knife,
and an Asian chick

that'll just straight kick
the shit out of you.

They'll make sure you're feeling
as much true pain as anyone.

Hey, yo, fuck my boy up
for a little bit, man.

You're making a huge mistake.

Deal with it, man!

I warned you.

-Oh, shit!

Get that nigga, man!

Yo, get that nigga!

Get that nigga, man!

Mind moving over?

-Yo, shoot, shoot, shoot!

Yo!

Shit!

-Shit!

-Cool.
-Fuck!

You're not allowed to use guns.

To kill you.

Besides,
I prefer this kind of heat.

50,000 volts, 200 amps.

-It'll hurt like hell,

but then you'll be dead.

This is my fifth hunt.

First time I've won.

Detroit PD. Back inside.

Run, Mr. Tynes.

LBJ's dead.

Nothing gets by you.

I know it's

the projects, Connell,

but there were
a hundred rounds fired,

and the authorities
will eventually show!

My job is one
of efficient precision.

If I rush, I fail.

I'm not telling you to rush.

I'm telling you
to hurry the hell up!

Why is he going to the hospital?

Hey.

Uh, I was given
this prescription for headaches

from Dr. Singhal and Dr. Levy,
but I don't think they're

what they're supposed to be.
Could-could you check for me?

Metaxalone.

You want pain meds?
Cruise the park.

No, no, no. I just want
to know about the pills.

Come on, it's meloxicam.

An anti-inflammatory.

I give out a hundred a day.

C-Could you check your files?

It's under Dodge Tynes. Please.

No Dodge Tynes in our system.

No Dr. Singhal...

or Dr. Levy, either.

That can't be right.

I-I saw him in D wing
two days ago.

Nice try.

D wing has been
under construction for months.

Hello, Dodge.

You set me up.

Now I'm hunting you.

"Set up" is a charged term,

with nasty connotations.

I made sure you were
guided to me,

so I could help you.

Only reason I agreed
to this shit

is 'cause I thought I was dying.

You weredying.

No money, no career, no future.

When was the last time
you really lived?

-I brought you back to life.
-Ah, screw it.

-I'm going to the cops.
-Yeah, to tell them what?

You don't know my real name,
where I am, or how to find me.

Conversely, I not only know
a lot about you,

I know a lot about your wife.

Like where she's been every
moment since the hunt started.

In fact, I have a dear friend
looking after her as we speak.

My wife never agreed
to this game.

Hunters can't go near her.

Ah, it isn't a hunter.
It's a dear friend of yours.

Who knows you best?

Your habits,
your running routine?

Your water stash
at The Carrington?

Looger.

In your best friend,
we found a man

who watched you enter
a white-collar world

while his collar remained
a permanent shade of blue.

You borrow his last penny,
he never gets a cent back.

He-He's angry.
And desperate.

50 grand to drug your water.

Oh, God.

Oh, God isn't organized enough
to pull off what I do.

Fake cops following you
for weeks,

waiting for you to collapse.

Fraudulent doctors,
bogus orderlies.

I spent a fortune
getting you into this hunt,

and if you think
you can punch out

just because things
aren't exactly how they seemed,

then think again.

Besides, now you really have
something to fight for,

considering you have
decades more to live...

provided, of course, that
you survive the next 90 minutes.

You're insane.

All the greats are.

I understand you literally ran
into my associate, Connell,

in the projects.

He says you now have a gun.
Guns are against the rules.

Well, rules are out
the window, asshole.

Okay, have it your way.

I'll notify
the remaining hunters

that guns are now permitted.

It's only fair.

Nothing about this
has been fair.

I admit, your entry
into this game

was not exactly forthright,

but the objective
remains the same.

You make it till sunrise,
you win.

Trust me on that.

I'm a man of my word.

-Hello?
-Hello.

You have a collect call from...

-Val, it's me, pick up.
-Will you accept the charges?

I accept the charges!

Val.

Dodge! Are you okay?

Val, listen.
Are you with Looger?

Yeah, he's right here.

Let me talk to him.

Can he hear me?

What? N-No.

Give me the phone.
I'll go get him.

Okay, listen,

we... we were lied to.

I'm not sick.
I don't have cancer.

-What do you mean?
-I can't explain right now,

but we're both in danger,
and Looger's a part of it.

Do you understand?
You got to get away from him.

Now you go to where
I proposed to you,

-and I'll be there
in 15 minutes.
-Yes, but...

No-no-no, Val,
you got to go now.

O-Okay.

What'd he say? Where is he?

-He said he's coming here.
-That's great.

Thank God.

I think I'm gonna get
some fresh air.

This has all just been
too much...

No way.

I don't want you
out of my sight.

Let's just wait for Dodge.

Okay.

Do you have any tea?

I think I just need something
to calm my nerves.

I got chamomile.

It'll just take a sec.

-Yeah, Connell?

I'm recommending termination.

Oh, are you?

Tynes is a wild card now.

The investors are aware;
that puts us all at risk.

In the 2,000 years
since these games began,

since the bravest Roman tiros
shunned the Coliseums

for purer competition,

we have never ceased a game
prior to conclusion.

And I'm not about to have
the history of what's been built

over millennia, die on my watch!

We just have to motivate
our runner a little more.

Make sure he understands

there is a price to pay
if he goes rogue.

Mrs. Tynes?

You all right?

-Officer Watkins.
-Heh.

Thank God.

You're gonna come with us now.

-No.
-Come on.

-No! Help!
-Hey!

Stop!

Hey! Don't you go
and get her killed, Dodge.

-Dodge!
-I got a message for you
from Miles.

He says
"Finish what you started."

Get your hands off my wife.

It's not just your wife
I got in my hands, hmm?

-Dodge.
-Val.

Just finish the hunt!

No!

Mrs. Tynes.

Please don't hurt me.

Hurt you?
Heavens, no, of course not.

There's no need for those.

Please. Sit.

For the baby's sake.

You've been through a lot.

Are you gonna hurt my husband?

Me? No, I'm not going
to hurt him.

Please.

Who areyou?

Well, you can call me Miles.

And let me say I'm sorry
things played out like this.

Collaterals are rarely involved.

They almost never
learn the truth.

Typically, you would have
already received a visit

from the police informing you
your husband

was murdered, mugging
gone wrong, something like that.

No... he's not really police.

We tapped your phone
so we can redirect

outgoing calls.
So when you called the cops,

you reached us, and we sent over

Officer Watkins here.

Well, bottom line,

you would have received
a large amount

of untraceable cash,

explained away
as a massive insurance policy

Dodge never told you about;

something he purchased
back in the salad days.

But...

your husband turned out to be
tougher prey than we're used to.

Prey?

Yeah. You see,
he's being hunted.

In a game that I construct
and orchestrate.

He... he agreed to participate.

To run for his life.

For all three of your lives.

Why?

Because I wanted him to.

You and your husband are alike.

You both think
you can fight back.

Changing up your look,
trying to stay warm...

Now, why would Dodge's
daddy's old car plant light up

like Chinese New Year?
Unless...

He's inviting us in.

All right, assholes.

Come and get me.

Well, howdy, Jeeves.

You got a slice of that chaw
for your old buddy Reagan?

No.

Good evening, Ms. Kennedy.

Lovely to see you again.

Nixon.

Reagan.

You bitches here to fight
for second place?

Oh, I assure you, my dear,

by the time I get done
here to...

Shit.

Let me tell you a story
about my Uncle Dutch.

He was gator huntin'.

He used to float dead rats
on top of beer cooler lids

with holes in 'em

so the-the scent would drip
down into the water.

One day, he was waiting
on one of them

big old dinosaurs
to pop his head up.

What he didn't know was

this big old 15-footer

was coming up the bank
right behind him.

The moral of the story is:

I ain't got no Uncle Dutch
no more.

Look like I'm
Uncle Dutch now, huh?

Where's my wife?

Don't do nothin'
you can't live with.

Where is she?

I have no idea who your wife is,

let alone her whereabouts.

Hell, I barely know
who you are.

Dodge, are you okay?

You found me again.

Yeah, when I saw
the plant lit up,

I figured it was you
asking for help.

Help? You've been helping them
this entire time.

What?

You drugged me, didn't you?
So I'd get headaches.

Dodge, I wouldn't hurt you.
You're my best friend.

Yeah? Give me the gun, then.

Look, Dodge, whoever
told you I crossed you

is screwing with your head.

Now let's get the hell
out of here before...

-Ah!

Come on. Let's go.

All right, hold on.

I don't give a piss squirt
about your rules.

Send somebody now!

I cannot assist a hunter
once the game begins.

I'm bleeding out here!

Send somebody to come
and get me!

Ah, Miles!

Ah, Jesus, no!

Dodge.

All right. You're okay.

There you go. Take a seat.

Less than a minute,
cops and ambulances

are gonna be all over.

They'll get you to a hospital.

I'm really sorry.

I never should have believed
what they said about you.

All right, sit tight, buddy.

Where you going?

To end this game.

Where are they keeping her?

I hope you like irony.

Val.

-You okay?

-Come on.
-Oh, my God,

I thought you were dead.

Let's get you out of here, okay?

-Oh, shit.

All right, he only wants me.

I'm gonna lead him out that way
and you stay here.

-No. No!
-Just stay here. You'll be fine.

I love you.

It makes sense that
he married a woman like you.

I don't have a gun anymore.

You could only use a gun
'cause I was.

You shoot me,
you break the rules.

Come on, mate.

Take my hand.

It's sunrise.
The hunt's over.

Good show, Mr. Tynes.

Bloody good show.

Ma'am.

Oh...

It's over.

It's over.

Yeah?

Dodge, congratulations.

I knew you were a winner
when I met you.

Now I want you to enjoy
the rest of your life,

even though none of it
will be as exciting

as the day I just gave you.

You're welcome.

Our next runner, sir.

Oh, Eduardo.

You have no idea
what's in store for you.
