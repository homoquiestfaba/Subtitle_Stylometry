For most sets,
if there was a second story...

...it's not really a second story, it's a--
There's a staircase that goes up...

...and then you're shooting
a bit of an elevated set.

They're not really on the second floor.
But we really are on the second floor.

This had to be set up
so that all our equipment...

...150 people sitting in the balcony
and everything would be there.

And it also had to be set up so that
we could get equipment up and down...

...and still shoot the show
in this environment.

It's Friday night in Hollywood
with Harriet Hayes...

...Simon Stiles, Tom Jeter...

...Jeannie Whatley...

How you doing?
Tim Busfield, <i>Studio 60</i> cast member.

Welcome. Here we are at
<i>Studio 60 Live on the Sunset Strip.</i>

That's the show.

This is the backstage area.
The set was designed by Carlos Barbosa.

Tommy originally had a very imp--

Very important to Tommy and Aaron
that they had a theater...

...not necessarily a studio.

We could have shot it here
at Warner Bros. like on a sound stage...

...but we really didn't wanna do that...

...because there wasn't just
any romance to movie sets.

Nothing exciting about them.

So they decided
if they went into a theater...

...and embodied the theater
much like David Letterman might do...

...that it would give us
a bit of history and romance.

I kept thinking about,
"This is a group of people...

...who get together every week
and put on a show.

This is a group of people
who get together...

...every week and put on a show. "

And as I kept--
That was the mantra. I went:

"Well, isn't that a theater experience?

So why couldn't it be
that the world that we set up...

...which is somewhat fictitious,
would take place in an old theater?"

Like the Pantages or the Egyptian
or the Chinese...

...that made-up, you know,
1930s art deco shell.

And it's just a shell that houses inside
the television studio.

Hey, I gotta go. All right.

Welcome back.

Anyway. So come with me.
This is a...

More a backstage area.
Backstage's very important to the show.

You're gonna see a lot of scenes
in the backstage...

...because it's backstage
and at a <i>Saturday Night</i> Live-type show.

Hi.
What are you doing here?

Danny and I are taking over the show.

You are?
I'm your boss now...

...so we're gonna have to postpone
this fight for a couple of years.

Really?
Yes.

No, I mean you're really
taking over the show?

Yes.

Or we could just end it now.
The fight.

That'd be fine too.
First of all...

...could you stop telling people
we broke up...

...because of the national anthem?
It makes me sound like an idiot.

Actually, consensus is
it makes me sound like an idiot.

As we move around the backstage...

...I'm gonna show you something
that I think is really cool.

There's a lot of sets
that are gonna come in and go.

You're gonna see a lot of pieces
of the set that are gonna--

Like this, like this car.

There might be a car sketch
in the back of a cab.

Right, that's right.
Yeah, I went through that.

We're doing it.

Matt, you can get another director,
you can get someone good.

I don't want someone else,
I want you.

The joke was, "I don't want
someone good, I want you. "

I know where the joke was.

The steel here, the set,
what's really cool about this is...

...all this stuff right here,
again, showing history...

...and showing
what a real theater would have.

And knowing Tommy Schlamme's style,
if you've watched Tommy's work...

...with <i>The West Wing</i>
or <i>Sports Night...</i>

...or, you know, his work on <i>E.R.</i>
and those shows...

...where people can really move...

...you're gonna see areas where cameras
can follow, just like we did right there.

We had a walk-and-talk last Friday.
We started up here...

You could pan--?

Tilt up here, we came
all the way around over to the band...

...we came down, all through here...

...then we ended up in these hallways.

It took us three hours to light.

Three hours. And Tommy goes,
"An hour. Why aren't we lit yet?"

And then it took us about five hours
to shoot the night.

And it was-- it's just, it's just--

it takes a lot of time,
it's just a lot of work. But it's...

The outcome was, it was-- I have
never done a shot like that in my life.

Go, camera C, arm it around.
On 2, back up.

Just about, please.

Okay, got it.

Let's make that a nice dissolve
tonight. That should be a push-in--

This is the-- This is the office for--

it was Judd Hirsch's office on the show,
but now it's gonna end up being...

...where Whitford and Perry hang out
for most of the show.

This is of course a 35 mm camera,
or maybe a 16 mm camera.

It's a 16, because
Tommy likes to shoot pilots on 16...

...because it's good luck.
I don't know why...

...but that's what he likes to do.

Anyway, more actors
and people like that, it is the office.

We're gonna work our way
back over here.

I'd love to. I'm on an EPK tour
right here.

This is Matthew Perry.
Hi, how are you?

Might remember him
from <i>The Whole Ten Yards.</i>

Anyway. So we're--
We're moving deeper into the space.

This is some secretary's place...

...where there's gonna be sex and
all kinds of things going on in the show.

This is the control room,
this is where my character works.

Because I'm the control room
director...

...and this is Tommy Schlamme,
the director.

The guy's got more Emmys
than anybody has ever had in their life.

He's gonna go into the Hall of Fame,
he's got nine.

I'm sorry, what?
Emmys.

Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, that's-- Sorry.

I guess I didn't say that clear enough,
I ran that together.

He's like, if you were to look at all
the California Angels out in the field...

...there's that many.
It's crazy, it's crazy.

Anyway, this is the control room
on the show.

This is where I'm gonna hang out.

What's the time
on Peripheral Vision Man?

-3:45.
Tell the writers...

...they're gonna have to stretch it
25 seconds.

Making it longer was
the missing ingredient in making it funny.

Stand by. We got a change at four-A.
Ninety seconds live.

This is Brad Whitford.

You probably recognize Brad
from <i>Revenge of the Nerds II.</i>

That was some of his best work
right there.

I have to go downstairs.
Matt's not there.

Where is he?
He's being taken in a separate car.

Why?
Because the press is...

...about 8 minutes
behind all of us tonight.

I'm going over there now.

But not to talk to your boss, or take over
the show, or hit it out of the park.

But to tell Matt before you do,
because that's your next step.

I have no intention of telling Matt.

That's nice, but I have no reason
to trust you and every reason not to.

Why?
You work in television.

And now we're back
right where the tour began.

This is the door I came through
at the very top.

I don't think we really looked
into this prop room over here.

We have props
and all kinds of, you know...

Anything we need for the sets.

And that takes us back now
into the theater itself.

Come with me. We've done a full loop.

And if you put it all together,
I think you'll really--

And you know Tommy's work,
you'll know...

...that this is a lot of how
Tommy's gonna shoot the show.

There's this and then she steps into it.
Okay.

And it becomes, you know, her shot.

But I can do two simple
film cameras, you know.

We'll do what we did yesterday.
Yeah. Right, right, right.

Exactly, but I've gotta shoot the video.
Right.

The four-camera video,
because I only have the squibs twice.

And then everything is...

I'm not thinking about
how do I stick out...

...with the large sea of television shows
that are out there.

All I can do is do the best job
that I know how to do right now...

...and try to figure out what's
the best way to shoot this show...

...with the material that I've read
and the actors that I have.

That's my job.
My job is not to reinvent the wheel.

The wheel's, I think,
a really structured, good wheel.

So I'm just figuring out
how to put it on my cart right now.

So I'm not thinking-- I mean,
I do think there is ways...

...that people are sort of feeling...

...that now television you've gotta catch
the eye of the viewer right away...

...you gotta do something.

Visually you've gotta tell the story
in a unique and different way...

...than it's ever been done.

<i>West Wing</i> had a visual look to it
that I think was unique.

But the visual look was completely
dictated by the way Aaron wrote.

Aaron still writes that way...

...so some of that look
will duplicate itself, you know.

There is no reason. it works that way.

I don't have to go,
"Well, I've done that already...

...I need to reinvent something else. "

I just can't be a party to the line
that's gonna be crossed...

...if we allow them their way on this.

I won't pay a $73 million fine.

I won't pay a 73 cent fine.

I won't time-delay the news
and I won't say I'm sorry.

I no longer recognize the authority
of the FCC in this matter.

I'm gonna have to be ordered
by a federal judge.

And when they come
to get my transmitter...

...they better send a group
a hell of a lot more scary...

...than the Foundation
for Friendly Families...

...or whatever the hell they are.

Let those guys embed themselves...

...with the Second Marine Division
for a while.

They'll rejigger their sense
of what's obscene in a quicker way.

Anyway, this is the stage.

This is where you might hear
a "Live from Studio 60--"

This is, you know...

...Felicity Huffman,
who we have actually.

Felicity Huffman in the pilot.

These sets will change all the time...

...I'm sure each week
these are gonna change.

The thing we're not gonna see which is--
Just to show you how much work--

This is already massive and huge...

...but it's only a shell
of what it's gonna be.

Everything you've seen here
is still gonna expand...

...and grow out in the vision
of what Tommy and Aaron had.

I've been a fan of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
for a long time.

I've always thought it would be fun
to set a show behind the scenes...

...at a late-night
sketch comedy TV show.

I like going behind the scenes
of things...

...we don't necessarily get to see,
you know.

I had always said
on <i>The West Wing:</i>

"Let's show the 5 minutes before
and after what we get to see on CNN. "

And same thing here.

You know, we all watch <i>Saturday</i>
<i>Night Live</i> and other shows on TV.

Let's show what we don't
ordinarily get to see.

And also what's nice, I think...

...just the way on <i>The West Wing</i>
what we were able to see...

...tell stories about our leaders...

...where they weren't
either Machiavellian or dolts.

They were genuinely good people,
good at their jobs, trying to do well.

I thought, "Is it possible that we can
show people who work in Hollywood...

...also as good people...

...who were good at their jobs,
trying to do something good?"

it may be a slightly harder
mountain to conquer...

...but we're gonna give it a shot.

It is about hard work...

...it's not about the fun and games
of doing-- Living in Hollywood...

...and a sort of romantic nature
of what our lives are like.

These are people who get up
really early and work really late.

And usually don't go to bed.
They're gonna live in this environment...

...which is our show.

It was a very interesting...

...question for me,
because I certainly...

...before I read it, was not looking
to do another one-hour drama.

I certainly was not looking, you know,
necessarily to do it with the two guys...

...who I had done
<i>The West Wing</i> with.

But it became very clear
after reading it...

...that this is the best material...

...and I realized
that I didn't act all my life...

...so that I could stop acting.

What's great about this is
it's a drama...

...so you can play real stuff,
but it takes place in this kind of--

In this funny world that people
don't normally get to see, you know.

So in <i>West Wing</i> people were funny...

...but, you know, their job was
kind of running the country.

And here it's very serious people
who take very seriously being funny.

I'm writing more personally
than I have before.

You know, I have no relationship
to the White House...

...or to ESPN or anything like that.

In this show, writing about people
who work in television...

...and living a life where
there are public complications...

...and weekly pressure to succeed...

...where failure, when it happens,
happens on such a massive stage.

Those things are a little closer to me...

...so it's both fun and frightening
at the same time.

My manager called and said,
"There's a new script by Aaron Sorkin. "

And because I love him so much
I said, "Send it over. "

A lot of us don't get this kind of material
and of course I read it...

...fell in love with it,
asked my fiancÃ© to read it.

He's a screenwriter
and he came in to the--

I told Aaron and Tommy this,
he came in to the bedroom...

...and he just looked like
he'd been shot.

And he said, "This is one of
the best scripts I've ever read...

...movie or TV or anything. "

I think that Aaron and Tommy,
our director and writer-producer...

I think very few people in television
would you classify as geniuses.

If you're a really good television writer,
chances are you don't stay that long.

But these cats are really--
They're geniuses.

And I'm just-- I'm--
I'm having the time of my life.

I mean, 16-17 hour days is like:

"Oh, damn, I should have got a job
at the post office. What is this?"

Look, I didn't wanna write
your damned mongongo fruit sketch.

I'd pay more attention
to your general tone of voice with me.

You're right.

I apologize.

It's just I'm saying, I don't--

You don't wanna work
on my sketch, fine.

But you don't wanna work on it
because it's black...

...that makes you the pool boy
at the little house of Uncle Thomas.

We're not doing a documentary
of what happens at <i>SNL.</i>

Certainly we're--

it's been inspired a lot
by behind-the-scenes accounts...

...of the early days of <i>SNL,</i>
of the current days of <i>SNL.</i>

That-- You know,
what you're seeing are people...

...Sunday through Friday.
They don't sleep a lot...

...they don't leave the building a lot,
they've got 90 minutes of television...

...to write, rehearse,
produce and execute.

And they want every show
to be as good as their best show.

The thing that's cool about it is...

...there's an infinite number
of possibilities of where you can go...

...where you can go with the show...

...and things that you can do
with all the characters.

There are so many things happening
not only as the show...

...but in the show within the show.

The show within the show
is fascinating.

It's going to take viewers
into the next dimension of television.

It's not just what you see
on your TV screen.

It's on a TV screen on your TV screen.

It's very complicated.

We're so behind the scenes
we don't know what's real anymore.

I think I'm behind the scenes
by just being here.

Because I'm--
I'm sort of like borrowed, right?

And I'm borrowed to play a guy
who's gonna be fired anyway, right?

So it's like--

You gotta play how to disappear.

In my life, I don't like the idea
of disappearing in anything.

Especially if I'm on something.

They'll deal with the opening 60 seconds
for the West Coast delay.

Wesley?
Yeah.

You're fired.
No kidding.

Escort him off the property.

He doesn't talk to any press
while he's on this property.

I remember with <i>Sports Night</i>
people asking:

"I don't understand,
is this a drama or a comedy?"

The fact of the matter is
I don't do either one well enough...

...to only do one of them...

...so I have to do both.

I don't think
you could type Aaron.

He uses comedy to get
to the dramatic moments...

...and he uses drama to get
to the comedy moments.

Like any great writer, he's just
not writing joke, setup, joke, setup.

So it's impossible to tell
where Aaron's gonna go.

It's what comes to him
and what comes through him.

He pays such close attention
to character...

...and it's all about the relationships,
which is...

...I think, ideal for actors
and audiences and yeah, so it's-- it's--

it's an honor to get to say those words,
and there's a lot of them too, so...

So, yeah, very cool, very cool.

I have a theater background.

And in theater nobody ever asks:

"Is it a drama or a comedy?"
Just, "Is it a musical or a non-musical?"

This is a non-musical.

It's so crazy when playing a character
within a character within the show...

...and then also being
that kind of character on the outside.

Like I am a sketch comedy guy.

You know, my background
is Second City...

...and Groundlings and stuff like that.

So you're trying to, "Okay, act
like you're getting ready for a sketch" ...

...and I'm really getting ready
for a sketch...

...but then I'm a character doing it,
it's--

it's insane, it's just crazy,
but it's all good.

We're live in eight, seven, six...

...five, four...

My fellow Americans...

...I'm here to speak to you tonight
about a very serious subject.

My legacy.

"Legacy" is a 480 SAT word,
which it turns out...

...does not mean
"a woman with nice legs. "

The writers are very open as far as...

The first rehearsal we had
they came to us and said:

"You know, tell us what characters
you're comfortable with, tell us--

Pitch us sketches, we're always
looking for interesting sketches...

...crazy characters,
things you've done before.

Come to us, we'd love--"

So, it's-- I think that's rare
that writers are that open...

...and are, you know, open to you,
kind of bringing your own ideas...

...about the character
and about the words.

This is an ensemble show...

...there are a lot of characters
and moreover, it's...

We're very, very lucky
with the cast that we've got.

We had a wonderful population
of great actors to choose from.

And Tommy and I
feel incredibly lucky...

...that these guys decided
to come to our show.

Playing a network executive is--
I now understand...

...what Anthony Hopkins felt
when he played Hannibal Lecter.

You go very, very deep, very dark.

It's an ugly, ugly, ugly place to exist.

You got a thing for one of these guys?
Or both of these guys?

I don't know
either one of them personally.

Is that a question you were asked
when you hired me?

You bet your ass it was.

I need to get started now,
I need to get to Matt and Danny.

I'm gonna wanna meet with them
before any hands are shaken.

They're not gonna audition for you.
We're gonna have a conversation.

What will you say in this conversation?
Whatever I damn well please.

You saw how fast
I fired Wes Mendell?

Screw this up...

...I'll fire you faster.

I'm not like every other heterosexual
male in show business, Jordan.

I don't find you charming.

And you've earned
the loyalty of absolutely no one.

People fear and loathe me
and I like that feeling.

It's good. I'm such a doormat
in real life.

So you go ahead,
you take your first steps...

...toward making us all classy again.

We've been waiting for you.

That's your office.

I'm excited to work with Brad.

I really respect him
as a dramatic and a comedic actor.

And we had pretty good chemistry...

...in the couple of episodes
of <i>West Wing</i> I did.

And here we get to play
different people.

And already in the couple of days
we worked together...

...we bounce off each other really well.
Our energies kind of--

We've got good chemistry.

There's kind of a-- Sort of
a Butch and Sundance thing...

...to these guys that one is--

I think Danny's...

...a little stiller, a little less buffeted
than Matt's character is.

But it's-- He's a lot of fun
to work with.

Are people looking at us right now?

I think they are.

Could you punch me in the face
or something?

Because to a casual observer
this appears...

...a little homoerotic for my comfort.

I definitely hear you on that.

What should we do?
Get off me.

All right, just play it cool.
Yeah.

The acting part
with Aaron Sorkin's words...

...is the relatively easy part.

And I'm not saying it's easy,
but it's exciting and inspiring...

...and the words are so brilliant.

You wait your whole career
to have lines like this.

Not yet, it's not. And until it is,
we're all gonna act professionally.

You understand?

We're gonna act, dress, talk,
write and behave professionally.

You are an adolescent,
oversexed whoremonger...

...with the sensitivity
of a head of cabbage.

And all that will begin
in just a few minutes.

I am the luckiest actress in town
that I get to say these words...

...and be directed
by Tommy Schlamme...

...even though his name is
Tommy Schlamme, which is crazy.

And Aaron's words are just, it's--
You know, it's just...

...I'm lucky, I'm so lucky
and I know that I'm lucky.

I actually love this process.

I'm not cynical about this process.

I'm not, "Gee, look at these other people
who work in television. "

And they're sort of either trying
to get your job or trying--

I-- Most of my experiences...

...95 per cent of my experiences
in this business have been really great.

And I feel very fortunate
to be able to do what I get to do.

So I'd like that to come across in this.

That even though it's tough
and even though it's difficult...

...and even though there's some
very high-maintenance human beings...

...that exist in this world...

...for the most part, they're people
who have come together...

...to work really, really hard,
long, long hours...

...to sort of do something
that is just gonna be enjoyed...

...by a lot of people
while they're eating dinner...

...or they're passing by or maybe they're
sitting down and really absorbing it.

Not on her back, on her stomach.

How you doing, Kim?
I want Tom to take his pants off.

Life's full of disappointments
and that will probably be one of them.

Stand back. Pieces might fly.

You're on Vicodin?
Yeah.

I may have exceeded
the recommended dosage.

Should you be out of bed this soon?
I play with pain.

Where's your wife?
Sitting right next to her husband.

I was just talking to you.
Sure.

I'm on a little Vicodin and some Percocet
and a steroid called Nortisone.

The side effect of which is mania.

I swear to God,
it says so right on the bottle.
