[WATER BURBLING]

Hi!

Hey! ALICE: Sorry I'm late.

No! ALICE: Rude.

I'm so sorry. No, it's fine.

It's fine. WAITER: Ladies.

Hey.Hey.

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]SOPHIE: Um, we'll have

a bottle of the chardonnay

and three glasses, please.

Sure. ALICE: Oh, no. Actually,

a vodka soda for me, thank you.

Uh, the waiter's
in love with you.

[TESS LAUGHS]

I mean, I really feel like
he does not know

the definition
of the word "boundaries."

Yeah, because he sent you,
like, 14 dick pics.

Oh, and... he waxes.

Wow. SOPHIE: Yeah.

No! Like, the whole...

Really? But why?

I don't know.

Oh. Alice's guy
from the swim team?

Okay, we don't have
to talk about Dolphin Dave.

I want to have a nice night,
thank you very much.

Like, I don't think that
shaving his body hair was

gonna make the difference
between Olympic trials

or not.

Oh, God.

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]Sorry.

Okay. Thank you.

Oh, thank you! You're very welcome.

Sophie.

The bottle.

And vodka soda.

Oh.

Yeah, you're welcome.

He's obsessed
with you. Sophie, stop.

You don't see it? Don't
tell me you don't see it.

I have a boyfriend.

Sophie, leave her alone.

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]Yes, thank you.

Sorry, it's just Simon.

Um, actually, he has
a gallery opening on Friday,

he wanted me to invite
both of you guys. Oh!

That'd be great.
That... Yeah. Yeah?

Yeah?

Yeah, definitely.

I just know there's, like...

collectors coming
and so he was saying

how much he would love
to introduce you.

Well, I'm not really working
in traditional media anymore.

Oh. That's amazing,
that's awesome.

It's new, we'll see.

Yeah. Uh...

Well, cheers.

Cheers.

Good to see you. You too.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]

[KEYS CLACKING]


Okay, so,
for my birthday... Yes.

No. No, no. Your 30th.

We were thinking the
three of us could go

to my parents' house up north.

Don't worry, Don and
Sylvie are in Florida,

so they will not be
gate-crashing the party.

Okay. You're gonna come, right?

You gotta come, it's gonna
be fun. And I demand it.

I will definitely see.

Oh.I should just go soon.

Hello?

[WATER RUNNING]

[GASPS IN PLEASURE]


Oh, my God!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I didn't think
you'd be so jumpy.

How was your night?

I liked your picture.

Just one, huh? We were at dinner!

Well, we're home now.

[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]

SIMON: Oh, you must be
feeling bad this morning.

[SIMON CHUCKLES]

ALICE: Feeling bad?

SIMON: I'm feeling
good, but I didn't

go hard on the
cocktails last night.


Never just a quiet
night with them two, is it?

No. [LAUGHS]

Do you want a cardamom bun

or a Danish?

I thought we were
cutting back on sugar.

Well, we are, but, you know,

we're good all through the week,

we can treat ourselves
every once in a while,

can't we?

Okay, whatever looks good.

Excuse me, can I
just get two coffees...


Yeah, it just came up.

Just came up.

Just came up.

Do you remember
that sales thing?

Well, I think it'd
be bad if I missed it.

Oh, so Colleen texted me.

Okay. Good to see you,
take care, bye!


They never remember me in there.

Like, I come in here every week,

it wouldn't kill
them to say hello.

They're so weird in there.

Okay, what do you want?

Danish looks all right.

It looks like fresh
out of the oven.

Oh, so Colleen texted me

this morning about
that sales thing,

Do you remember this
thing I told you about?

Well, anyway, it turns out
now they do need me to go.

Why?

Just, I came up, I guess.

I mean, it's gonna
be boring, you know?

A trip to Minneapolis,

but I think it'd be bad
if I missed it.

I guess you just
give me the impression

that you didn't really
care about that job.

I think you can do
better than that.

MAN: A blank canvas
can be intimidating.

How do you get started?

SIMON: Uh,
experimentation, you know.

Well, you know, I
try to be free with it.

I just... I'm boring myself.

I show everything to
Alice at a very early stage.

Oh, I'll be right back.

Hi! Oh, my God. [SQUEALS]

Oh, God, I feel like a potato.

You couldn't be a potato.

You look nice, though.

Oh, yeah. Simon got it for me.

It's expensive.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Uh, where's Tess, I thought
you were gonna come together?

Um, so, she's...

Okay, she's not coming.

It's just... yeah,
she said she would,

so I put her
on the list, and I... I know.

Please don't
be mad at her. No, I'm...

It's fine, it's fine. You
know what she's like

when it comes
to work stuff. I know.

She gets all in her head and...

you know. I'm sorry.

It's fine. Hey!

Hi, Sophie. Hi!

Thank you! Oh,
my God, I need this.


that the non-profit world,

it attracts nearly as many
narcissists and sociopaths

as, like, the corporate
sector does, so...[ALICE LAUGHS]

Well, I think that what
you do is amazing.

I do, I do. I think
it's incredible.

It's like a million
times more important

than any
of this, but... Oh, my God.

Thanks for coming anyway.

Stop it, this is amazing.

Congratulations. Thank you.

Thank you for inviting me.

I hope it's a huge success.

I'm so glad you could make it,

it's great to see you.

[LECTURING INDISTINCTLY]

Thank you.

Hey!

Mmm.

Mini pork bun? Oh, I'm fine.

You sure? I'm fine.

SIMON: Alice, Uber's
here. I'm sorry we didn't

get to hang out
all night. It's okay.

It's a big night for him.

So,

you are gonna come to the
cottage, right? I promise, I promise.

SIMON: Alice! I'll see you tomorrow,

good night. I love you. Come on.

Let's go! Goodnight. Love you, too.

[SIGHS AND CHUCKLES]

SIMON: It was a complete
fucking train wreck.

No one even showed up.

There were, like,
a hundred people there.

I'm talking about
important people.

You still don't
understand this business.

It's cutthroat.

If people aren't
coming to your shows,

it's because you're washed up.

You have to be the best

or you're nothing.

You are the best.


You are to me.

Oh, my love. I wish
you could see what I see.

My perfectionist.

You're so brilliant.

You're amazing.

Hey.

[SIMON SIGHS]

SIMON: [CONTENTEDLY] Hmm.

SOPHIE: Hey! Thank you.

[UPBEAT MUSIC
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]

â™ª You're like a bomb

â™ª And I'll never be the same

â™ª My heart just blown away

â™ª In the middle of the day

â™ª You're like a bomb

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
â™ª Thought I was doing okay â™ª

[TESS AND SOPHIE CONTINUE
SINGING INDISTINCTLY]

[BREATHES DEEPLY]



[BREATHING DEEPLY]

can you pull over?

You okay?


Fuck. Sorry, guys.

SOPHIE: You okay? Yeah.

SOPHIE: Oh, God. Oh, no.

ALICE: I shouldn't have
looked at my phone, it's my bad.

You're all right.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]


SOPHIE: All right. TESS:
I want birthday pancakes

with real syrup. SOPHIE: Okay.

Then leave the fake stuff.

We got maple syrup right here.

TESS: All right. SOPHIE: Okay.

You want chocolate
chip pancakes?

Of course you do. Okay.

Two. And s'mores.

SOPHIE: Ooh, S'mores! Good idea.

TESS: Okay.

CASHIER: I think
it's just crazy.

You can't let a girl
like that wander around

doing whatever she wants.

I mean, of course,
she's gone missing.

Parents have no rules anymore.

CUSTOMER: [SCOFFS]
My kids know exactly

what kind of hell
there'd be to pay

if I caught them
sneaking around like that.

CASHIER: I mean, why would
she put herself in that situation?

TESS: Shotgun.

SOPHIE: What's a yoga bro?

TESS: You know, it's those
super muscular guys

that have to grunt
their way into every pose.

It's totally performative.
SOPHIE: Right. [CHUCKLES]

TESS: And they have
to fight their way

to the front of the class

so everybody can see
their balls hanging.

[SOPHIE AND TESS GIGGLING]

SOPHIE: All right.

Thank you.

TESS: Oh, your dad finally
fixed the screen door.

SOPHIE: Yeah, he did
it when he opened up.

Got it. SOPHIE: Thank you.

Okay.

All right. You
can put that there.

And then through here.

Okay, Tess, you're
in my brother's room.

Alice, you're in
my room at the end.

Great. SOPHIE: Yeah.

TESS: Hmm. SOPHIE: Remember these?

TESS: I love how
your mom never changes

anything about
this place.[SOPHIE GIGGLES]

[CONVERSATION
CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

SOPHIE: All right. [GRUNTS]

Thank you.


SOPHIE: You're right. [LAUGHS]

Why... Why... Why have I stopped

having sleep orgasms?

ALICE: That's normal for you?

In your sleep to...

I like a free orgasm.[SOPHIE LAUGHING]

Me, too. Oh, my God.

Wouldn't have to
put in any work.

I had a sex dream
the other night.

Oh?

No. I mean, it was bad.

Oh.It was...

It was with the, um...

the waiter from the wine bar.

He's hot.Ugh.

Like, I shouldn't be having

sex dreams about someone
else when I'm with Simon.

Oof. Who told you that?

No one, that's just how I feel.

Um, I'll clear...[PLATES CLINKING]

SIMON: Alice.

Alice.

Alice!

Look at me.

You don't want me?

ALICE: I'm just tired. Listen.

If you don't want to fuck
me, you don't want to fuck me.

[PHONE CHIMES] Alice.

SOPHIE: Alice?

Will you come join us?

Sure.

I don't know, I mean... I don't...

[PHONE CHIMES]

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]

[SENT ALERT CHIMES]

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

[KEYS CLACKING]

[SENT ALERT CHIMES]

[PHONE THUDS ON TABLE SOFTLY]

PODCAST HOST: Hey, everyone,
you are listening toHurdle.

I am so, so excited
to bring you today's episode

because I am chatting
with my dear friend...

PODCAST GUEST: ...core values,
and we're living

and breathing them
every day in our lives.

That's what makes us feel most
fulfilled. PODCAST HOST: Right.

PODCAST GUEST: So if you can
begin your day like that,

so it's not own your morning,

a.k.a., like, do as much
as possible within,

like, a three-hour time span

starting at 4:00 a.m.
PODCAST HOST: Correct.

PODCAST GUEST: But they're
owning your morning

by giving you and yourself,

and your mental health,
and your soul what it needs.

[KEYS CLACKING]

[SENT ALERT CHIMES]

[ENGINE ROARING]

MAN: Hi there.

Have you seen this
girl? Andrea Evans.

ALICE: No, uh, we
just got here yesterday.

I'm sorry I can't
be more helpful.

You keep that,

there's a hotline you can
call if you've seen anything.

Search parties leave at 8:00
every morning from the church,

if you could spare the time.

Yeah, okay.

Uh, thank you. Or, good luck.

Take care.

TESS: Double word score.

SOPHIE: Wow. "Door."
Wow, well done.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

You are making this too easy.

My turn. All right.

TESS: All right. That was rude.

You really did it.[SOPHIE LAUGHS]

SOPHIE: Don't be mad.

TESS: What? No.SOPHIE: Yes!

Hey, Gossip Girl, we
need a second opinion.

Uh, what is it?

"Quakey."

Uh, maybe.

We'll take that
as a yes, so that is

twenty-one, double word score.

Wait, why Gossip Girl?

I don't know,
the phone, the hair.

You are aware that
popular culture has evolved

over the last decade. TESS: And?

SOPHIE: Maybe your references
are getting a little bit stale.

Yeah? TESS: Mm-hmm.

TESS: A reboot? With who?

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]


[KEYS CLACKING]

[SENT ALERT CHIMES]

Hey.

Um...

so I think I'm gonna
have to leave early.

I know, it's just, work is

really intense right now.

TESS: Seriously? We're
here for my birthday.

I... Yeah, I... Sorry, I...

I don't really expect
you to understand.

TESS: You're right,
I don't understand.

I was under the impressionthat
we took the week off

so that we could
spend it together.

What are you taking
the week off from?

TESS: I'm sorry,
does my work not count

because I don't get paid for it?

SOPHIE: Of course,
your work counts, Tess.

Your work is amazing.

TESS: [SIGHS] Sophie, that's not

what we're talking
about right now.

[TESS SIGHS][FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

Hey.Hello.

Guess what I brought?

What?

Fireworks for Tess' birthday.

It's a surprise
so don't say anything.

Why are you doing
all this for her?

I think you should
cut her some slack.

This is a...

It's a milestone of a birthday,

and I think that
she is a little nervous

'cause... she thinks that
she should be further along.

I think she would expect

to be at Simon's
level right now,

not that she would admit that.

Anyway,

I thought we could have a picnic

at that little island
across the lake.

Yeah, I don't want to be
in a boat with her right now.

Stop it, it'll be fun.

Sophie, I'm serious.


Maybe this is

just about our
friendship not being

what it
used to be. Whose friendship?

Mine and Tess'.

I don't think you're being fair.


we all think our worst
thoughts at night.

You will not think this
way in the morning.

[FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]


MAN: Andrea!

WOMAN: Andrea!

MAN: Andrea!

WOMAN 1: I haven't let the
girls leave the house in days.

They're on the verge of mutiny.

WOMAN 2: If she's hurt, it's
probably someone she knows.

WOMAN: Andrea!

MAN: Andrea!

SIMON: Listen,
forget about the history.

We talked about this
over and over.

You've told me you can't be
your real self around them.

When you've seen them, do
you have a good time or not?

[TESS AND SOPHIE LAUGHING]

SIMON: Why do you
put yourself through this?

Do you feel better or worse?

And I think you already know
what you have to do.

And there is
a really easy solution,

you don't need them
in your life anymore.

It's tough, I know it's tough.

Part of growing up is
knowing when to let go.

Hey, you missed
a really fun day.

Hey, where were you?

I went out with
one of the search parties.

Hmm. Did you find her?

No.

So, definitely worth missing
spending the day with us, then.

All right, I need some
help at the wood shed,

can you help me out? Mm-hmm.

SOPHIE: Thank you.

Fuck me![LAUGHING]

Okay, lesson number one.

This is a maul.

I never want to hear
you call it an ax, okay?


So look for the natural
splits in the wood,

get your distance.

Feet like so.Okay.

And when you swing,

you want this hand
to fall in line

with this hand. So, like...

Okay.

Got it? Yeah.

Wow. You're good. Well,

that was hardly anything.

Okay.




Shit.

Alice? I think we have enough.

No, it's fine.


Yeah.

Thanks.


SIMON: You just pretend to be
this meek little victim.

You sit there with this
placid look on your face.

I'm here
trying to get through to you,

I'm actually asking you
to do something.

This is exactly what you do.
This is exactly what you do.

I'm tired...

of carrying you.

[SOPHIE PLAYING GUITAR]

â™ª You say

â™ª I only hear what I want to

â™ª You say

â™ª I talk so all the time

â™ª So

â™ª And I thought
what I felt was simple

â™ª And I thought
that I don't belong

â™ª And now that I am leaving

â™ª I thought that
I did something wrong

â™ª 'Cause I missed you

â™ª Yeah, yeah

â™ª I missed you â™ª

Alice.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on. No, I don't want to.

All right.

Okay.

SIMON: Hey.

I want you.

[LOUD PARTY MUSIC PLAYING]

TESS: Whoo! All
right! Come on, Sophie!

SOPHIE: Tess! TESS: [HUMMING]

Good morning! SOPHIE: Tess.

PODCAST GUEST: And then what
happens to your body,

it goes into starvation mode

and you feel compelled to eat...

PODCAST HOST: But, like...
like, a super a lot.

PODCAST GUEST: [LAUGHS]
Super a lot, got it.

[CAR APPROACHES]

You're gonna give us diabetes.

cinnamon rolls,

I can't do it without sugar.

You know it's more
addictive than cocaine, right?

Yeah, obviously.

Cocaine isn't even that good.

You know, I remember a time

when you used to like sugar.

Yeah.

There's just
all this research now

on how it, like, corrodes
your organs and stuff, so.

Hmm.

What?

I...

I just know what
disordered eating looks like.

Is this better? Alice, what are you doing?

I mean, if you think I should
have more, I can just keep going.

Stop! Alice, stop! Is something wrong?

I'm fine! I'm fine! Stop, Alice!

[CELL PHONE RINGING]


Hey, baby.

Yeah, no, I can hear you.

What's going on?

I have no idea.

SIMON: [OVER PHONE]
...your friends,

and that you're actually
at a cottage.

So you... you lied to me.

Yeah.

[SIMON CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

No, I know.

This is just classic bullshit.

Like, why would you tell me

that you're going on
a road trip when you...

I don't know why. I know.

[SIMON CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

Yeah, I love you.

[DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND CLOSES]

Who was that?

Uh, just Simon. He needs me.

What? Why? You're kidding.

No.What, he can't figure out

how to turn the dishwasher on?

When did he become more
important to you than us?

Jesus Christ, Tess!

Not everything's about you.

Me? Are you serious?

TESS: I can't believe
she's talking about leaving.

SOPHIE: Yeah.

TESS: She could have
stayed for my birthday.

SOPHIE: It's... frustrating.

TESS: We're having
a good time, right?

[SOPHIE RESPONDS INDISTINCTLY]

TESS: When did she
become such a flake.

SIMON: I love you, Alice.

Did you take my stuff?

Cinnamon bun? Tess.

What stuff?

My phone and my wallet.
I know you have them, come on.

Why would I take
your phone and your wallet?

You know why. I want to hear you say it.

Sophie went to the store and...

hm, you and I need
some alone time.

that we need, man.

Okay, come on. You
know me better than that.

I'll never forgive
you, just so you know.

I'll tell you where they are

if you come out
on the paddle board.

Oh, my God.
[LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY]

TESS: Should we
play a game? ALICE: Like what?

TESS: Stand up. Why?

Come on, it'll be fun.


[GRUNTS, LAUGHS][GASPS]

Come on, fight back.


Come on!

Christ, Tess.



Ugh!

What is wrong with you?

I didn't think
you were gonna fall in.

You were sitting down.

Can you help?

[ALICE GRUNTS][SCREAMS]


Yeah, it's freezing!

What?

What? My earring!

Fuck! Well, it's gone now.

Simon gave me those earrings.

[INHALES DEEPLY]


[INHALES DEEPLY]


What are you doing?

It's like 30 feet deep here.

You can't see shit down there.


Stop it.

Alice!

Alice!


What are you doing?[COUGHING]

I can't... I can't...

I can't... Can't what?

I can't do another thing wrong.


I can't do another thing wrong.

Alice, what does that even mean?

No, I lied to him. He doesn't
even know that I'm here.

What? I mean, he does now.


Well, why did you lie to him?

Because I'm bad. [GASPS]

What?


He wouldn't love me if
he knew how bad I am.

Jesus, is that something
that he tells you?

You're such a fucking
cunt sometimes.

TESS: [MUFFLED] Alice?

Alice?

[SNIFFLES, SOBS]

Alice, is it? No! Just... no.

[DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND CLOSES]

Hey.

TESS: Why do you let
him pull this shit with you?

He's not... He's
not pulling anything.

I lied to him, he has
every right to be angry.

You lied? About what?

Just... about being here.

TESS: Alice, you can't tell

your supposed life partner

that you're going to go on
a trip with your best friends

and somehow that's your fault.

I can't think of a bigger
red flag than that. ALICE: It's not...

SOPHIE: Hey, can we
just approach this

without judgment?

Are you seriously
telling me that you have

no opinions about this?

Of course I do, but
Alice is a grown woman.

Yes! And I don't know
how any of this is

your business. When you're friends

with somebody, it means you care

about the other person.

But I guess that's a concept

Simon managed to
erase from your brain

along with the rest
of your personality. Tess, stop it.

ALICE: Maybe this
is my personality

and I'm changing,

and you're the shitty
friend for not, like,

letting me change.
We're not all content

to, like, flip between projects.

Some of us have
real adult lives.

Fucking a 40-year-old
does not make you an adult.

He's 37.

Yeah, he's a fucking clown.

And he's got this stupid,
smarmy accent

and his art is...

self-indulgent,
derivative garbage.

You're just jealous because
he's successful and you're...

[ALICE BREATHING HEAVILY]

[ALICE EXHALES DEEPLY]

I'm what?


Simon loves me. I'm happy.

Is this what you think love is?

What would you know?
You've never been

in a serious relationship.

Romantic love isn't
the only kind of love.

Only boring people think that.

Okay, cool.
I guess I'm boring then.

Well, I mean, if the
shoe fits. I didn't say it.

God, I can't stand
you right now!

I can't stand you right now!

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY]

fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.


[BREATHING DEEPLY]



[DOOR OPENS]SOPHIE: Alice?

Please, please go away.
Please go away. Please go away.

Please go.


Alice? Please go away, please!

[BREATHING DEEPLY]


MAN: Andrea!

WOMAN: Andrea!

ALICE: Hello?

Andrea?

[EXHALES SOFTLY]

[FAUCET STOPS RUNNING]

[EXHALES SOFTLY]

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

TESS: I'm assuming you
don't care that I was worried.

Can I come in?

I guess.

I made you a sandwich
in case you're hungry

but don't want to admit it.

Thank you.

Sophie's gone looking for you.

I think she's pissed at us.

I'm sorry that I made you worry.

You good?

I don't want to go home.

Then we'll stay.




Sophie back yet?

No.

This ax is a piece of shit.

That's actually a maul.

Ugh, great.

Thank you for that.

TESS: "She felt very young,

"and at the same time
unspeakably aged.

"She sliced like a knife
through everything.

"She had a perpetual sense
of being out, out,

"far out to sea and alone.

"She always had
the feeling that it was

"very, very dangerous
to live even one day."

I like you
reading me to sleep.[TESS CHUCKLES]

[CAR APPROACHING]

TESS: You were gone a while.

SOPHIE: I needed some space.

You know,

this trip isn't just
about you, Tess.

You make me sound like a bully.

Well...

[GASPS DRAMATICALLY]

I'm not a bully!

Oh, my God, stop!

Wow. Now that is cleared up,

who would like a donut?

Hot Chocolate?

Yes, please.Yeah.


SOPHIE: How did Simon
know you were here?

ALICE: He looked at my email.

He never would have let me come.

TESS: What?

ALICE: Yeah, he checks
things sometimes.

SOPHIE: Alice.

ALICE: I know.

He always has a reason.
[LAUGHS HALF-HEARTEDLY]

I take my phone into
the bathroom with me

now when I shower.

WOMAN: Andrea!

MAN 1: Andrea!

MAN 2: Andrea!

ALICE: I know this sounds
crazy, but sometimes it feels like...

like he can read my mind,

and, like...

if he can do that, then...

there's nowhere left
that I can actually be alone.

I never know what's
going to make him angry,

so I spend all this time

trying to be good, trying to
think of ways to be better.

Like if I could just
purify my thoughts.


But you can't. I mean...

it's never good enough.

I... I don't know.

But he doesn't hurt me
or anything, you know?

He doesn't hurt you?


I really wish you would
have told us this sooner.

I didn't know what to say.

ALICE: [HUMMING]
â™ª Happy birthday to you

[SINGING AND LAUGHING]
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

Happy birthday!

TESS: Wow!

ALICE: Oh, you're
a wise old lady now.

TESS: Uh, I have always
been a wise old lady.

In spirit, at least.

Now you are in body, too.Mm-hmm.

I'm just gonna go for it.

Uh, I'm sorry, but I don't think

this is enough chocolate chips.

Whoa. Excuse me?

Is this how you treat
people on their birthday?

That's a good
chip-to-pancake ratio.

Oh, my God.

We should go out tonight.

Is there even
anything around here?

Maybe the place
near the food mart.

I just don't know if it's open
this early in the season.

I could check if I had my phone.

Do you want it back?

No.

Not yet.

What will he do if he
doesn't hear from you?

I'm not sure.

I could text him

and tell him that
you got hit by a bus.

[SOPHIE LAUGHS][CHUCKLES]

Oh, my God, Tess.[TESS CHUCKLES]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Oh, happy birthday! Happy birthday!

ALICE: Happy Birthday! To me.

To you!

ALICE: Oh, Jesus.

Ugh!

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]



[ALL LAUGHING]

SOPHIE: No, I...
I feel like I got one.

ALICE: Don't say that!

SOPHIE: No, in sympathy.
In sympathy.

I don't really have one,

but I just need to pee
all the fucking time.

ALICE: Needing to pee and
having a UTI is not the same thing.

SOPHIE: Yeah, it is!
It's like Cystitis and, like...

TESS: Cystitis? ALICE: Oh, she's smart.

SOPHIE: I need to pee.

So, you know.

I... ALICE: Ugh.

Do you guys know what? SOPHIE: What?

ALICE: Hey. SOPHIE: What?

ALICE: â™ª You say

[TESS GASPS]

â™ª I only hear what I want to


SOPHIE: Come on, sing it.

ALICE: â™ª You say

â™ª I talk so all the time

ALL: â™ª So

[ALICE SCATTING AND LAUGHING]

ALL: â™ª And I thought
what I felt was simple

â™ª And I thought I don't belong

â™ª And now that I am leaving

â™ª Now I know that
I did something wrong

â™ª 'Cause I missed you â™ª


â™ª Yeah, I missed you

â™ª You say

[MUMBLING TO TUNE]

â™ª Dying since the day
they were born, yeah

â™ª Well... â™ª

[MUMBLING TO TUNE]

â™ª ...but I'm thrown

â™ª And I thought I'd live forever

â™ª Now I'm not so sure You
try to tell me that I'm clever

â™ª But that won't take me anyhow

Oh, yeah â™ª Or anywhere with you

â™ª You said that I was naive

â™ª And I thought
that I was strong

â™ª I thought, "Hey,
I can leave, I can leave."

â™ª Oh, but now I know
that I was wrong â™ª

[ALL CONTINUE HUMMING]


Hmm. Simon thinks
chips are disgusting.

Nobody actually
thinks that. ALICE: He does.

"Alice, that's enough...

"that's enough
saturated fats to... [GIGGLES]

[IN BRITISH ACCENT] "Alice, that's
enough saturated fat to kill a horse.

"Alice. [LAUGHS] Alice...

"You'll regret that when you
get on the scale in the morning.

"You are going to get fat
if you keep eating like that."

[BOTH LAUGHING]

[TESS AND SOPHIE
CONTINUE LAUGHING]

What, do I just light it?

This was your idea.

That doesn't mean
I know how to do it.

ALICE: Just, I don't
know, light the string thing.

This thing? ALICE: Yeah.

Gosh.[ALL SCREAMING]


ALICE: Oh, my God. [SCREAMS]


I feel like garbage.

You asked the waitress
for birthday shots.

Remember that drink
you used to make us?

Which one? Gin and Smirnoff Ice.

Ugh.[GROANS]

[CAR HONKS]

Oh, that must be egg guy.

Egg guy?

Oh, you should come.
He's guaranteed to have,

like, a duck
or a kitten with him.

TESS: I like cats.

[ALL GIGGLING]


There's my girl.

Missed you.

I didn't know you were coming.

I've been calling and calling.

SOPHIE: Well, the service
is pretty bad up here.

Your Instagram feed
says otherwise.

Well, I'm sure Alice will
explain it all to me later.

Jesus fucking Christ.

Alice, will you stop fussing?

SOPHIE: I can...

SIMON: It's... It's fine.

I guess I got too much, eh.

I hope no one was
desperate for olives.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

SOPHIE: This is kind
of a girls trip, Simon.

We weren't expecting you.

SIMON: [CHUCKLES] What,
are we telling ghost stories?

Alice was missing me,
so I thought I'd swing by.

Tess.

And Sophie.Thanks.

Your favorite, my love.

Thank you.

Jeez, are you sure
you're not trying

to give us mad cow
disease, Simon?

Would you like me
to put yours back on,

Tess? It's fine.

It's really
not a problem. It's fine.


Well, cheers.

Cheers.

I was pretty worried about you

when I didn't
hear back from you.

You know, I heard about
the girl who went missing.

Yeah.

SIMON: They didn't find
the guy who killed her yet.

Why would you just
assume that she's dead?

I'm not assuming.

The checkout clerk couldn't
stop going on about it.

Um, I found...

this thing out of that cottage.

It's just weird.

It might be hers,
it might mean something.

What, this?

Alice, darling, I...

I really don't think anyone's
gonna care about this.

No, probably not.

You look different.

She looks like herself.Mm-hmm.

SIMON: No, it's
the hair, I think.

Yeah, it's very...

bohemian.

My beautiful girl.

SIMON: Hmm.

You didn't tell me you were
living in the lap of luxury.


But then there's lots of
things you didn't tell me.

I mean, how are we
supposed to be happy together

if we can't trust each other?

Are you sorry for what you did?

It's completely destabilizing

when you do shit like this.

It derails my work.

I know, I'm sorry.

I just... I...

I'm trying to work out

why you would choose

to hurt me
so deliberately. I just... No.

I...

I mean, I just wanted

to hang out
with my friends.Right.

I wasn't... So you wanted to be here

with them at my expense.

You're incredibly selfish.

[TAPS BED] Come here.

Come on.

I haven't even got to
properly kiss you yet.


Just let me brush my teeth.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]



Should...

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[MOANING LIGHTLY]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]


[MOANING INTENSIFIES]

[BREATHING STEADIES]


[ZIPS PANTS]

Actually I need
to get up as soon

as possible in the morning

so we can get out of here.

I can't wait to get home.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

You're leaving?

Uh, I have to. Yeah.

You know that.


SIMON: Be home soon.

Ah...

SIMON: God, they take
themselves so fucking seriously,

don't they?


Come on, man.

should get out and push.

[GLASS SHATTERS]

TESS: Sophie!

SIMON: What the fuck.

What the fuck are you doing?

Look what you've done
to my fucking car!

SIMON: What...

What the... What
is wrong with you?

[GROANS IN FRUSTRATION]

Alice.

Alice, come on. Get in the car.


Alice.

No.

SIMON: Jesus Christ.

Come on. Mm.

We should get going.

Let's just...

Come on, put
the fucking ax down.

It's a fucking maul, Simon.

Can you put the maul down?

Alice?

I know you're very emotional.

In fact, I came out here

because I was worried.

She said no.

Alice?

Just... Hey.

Hey.

Alice, let's just, uh...

just take a breath.

Just get in the car.

Come home.

You've always said

they don't really know you.

You're so full of shit.

Alice.

It's just...


It's you and me,
come on. It's just us.

Let's go home.

We can work through this.

I'm trying to prove I'm someone

who really loves you.

Let's just forget about
all of this, it doesn't matter.

She said no.

Why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

And stay the fuck out of this!

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Back off!

It's okay.


[SIMON LAUGHING]

[CAR DOOR CLOSES][CONTINUES LAUGHING]

[BREATHES DEEPLY]

SIMON: Fuck this.

[SIMON SCOFFS]

I give it a week.

[CAR DOOR CLOSES]

[ENGINE STARTS]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]



ALICE: It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

ALICE: Sometimes I get a...

a word or a saying
stuck in my head.

Like a...

phrase that keeps surfacing,

and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again

until it's all I can hear.

And for a while,
it was this voice asking me...

"What are the chances?

"What are the chances?
What are the chances?"

TESS: What are
the chances of what?

Um, I don't know. Maybe...

what are the chances I don't
come out on the other side?

What are the chances
I don't want to?

lately, it's, um...

someone asking me,

"Where will you put your shame?

"Where will you put your shame?"

And it's my voice, but it isn't.

You can give it to us.

Here.

Did it work?
