(The Good-hearted Daughter)

My mother-in-law urged that Older Sister and I

should leave back to our original clans

because she is returning to her husband's clan.

This is why Older Sister is returning

to her parents' clan today.

We became sisters

because we married into the Vang family.

Our sisterhood has just begun,

and yet we are already parting.

Now that you are leaving,

please remember me.

I'm thankful that we had the chance to be sisters.

Though we must part,

I'll always keep you in mind.

Older Sister,

I hope that we'll meet again someday.

Younger Sister, because you are crying,

I don't want to leave.

Then I won't cry anymore.

You should go now so you can reach
your parents before nightfall.

As for me, I followed my mother-in-law.

AfterOlder Sister's departure,

my mother-in-law and I traveled

into the northern lands

of her husband's clan.

At the rooster's first crow

I must rise to prepare breakfast.

I must fully dress before I begin any work.

I prepare food not only for us,
but forouranimals too.

Vegetables are chopped and boiled to feed
my hogs every morning.

I don't let them eat food that is not fresh

because my mother-in-law and I count them
as ourfamily members.

They are all we have now.

Back then, we also had cattle and horses,

but now Mother-in-law and I have
only this hog and herpiglets.

As new arrivals in these lands, my mother-in-law
and I have no fields of ourown.

As new arrivals in these lands, my mother-in-law
and I have no fields of ourown.

Everyday, I must work in the fields of the local
villagers in orderto receive food.

Today, I'm working for Lady Zong Chue.

Even though my mother-in-law is not well,
I must find work in orderto feed us.

It's so hot today.

Yes it is very hot. Because you don't work everday
like me, you aren't as burnt.

People wouldn't even recognize that I'm Hmong
if I went into the city.

Both of you should stop talking.

We might not finish cutting these rice stalks
before nightfall.

In this village, Xi is the closest relative of my
husband.

Sister-in-law, you've returned from the fields?

Yes.

Mother, you don't seem well at all.

You've returned already?

Yes, I'm home.

Mother, eat.

What about you?

Let me feed you first, then I'll eat.

I can't eat anymore.

Have one more spoon, Mother.

No more.

Just one more spoon, Mother.

No more.

Last one.

Today, I'm working for Nia Cha.

They are better off, so they have rice with meat.

But I only supplement my rice with peppers.

After toiling an entire day in the field,
we come to collect ourpay.

The workers labor formoney,

but I do it for rice.

I thought they would fill up my basket,

but it wasn't what I had hoped for.

Here are some herbal medicine.

Chop it up and let it sit in cold water.

Then have your mother-in-law drink it.

After that, scrape her fingernails and toenails.

How much should I chop?

It's very bitter, so only chop a small amount.

Alright.

Also, here is a bundle of leaf medicine.

Crush them and wrap them around your
mother-in-law's wrists and ankles.

These will stop fevers.

How much should I crush?

Divide that bundle into three separate uses.

Alright then. I'll be on my way.

See if the herbs help. If they don't, let me know.

Alright.

Goodbye.

Thank you, Aunt.

I hope that the herbal medicines Aunt Za gave me

will help my mother-in-law get well.

Mother, lets have you sit so I can give you
medicine.

I wonder if these leaves can actually help.

I might not get better.

If I'm gone, what are you going to do?

Mother, you'll get well soon.

You must remain by my side.

Mother, drink this.

It's quite bitter, so take your time.

The elders believe that after taking medicine,

fingernails and toenails must be scraped

so the illness will subside quicker.

In a little while, I'm going to wash our clothes.

All done, Mother.

You can rest.

Once a week I wash our clothes.

Every time I come to the river I'm alone.

Fortunately, today,
there is a village woman here too.

Let me help you wash.

I can do it myself, you probably have other
errands waiting.

I'm actually not in a hurry.

Thank you.

Since you often work in other people's fields,

you might consider trying Lady Zongkai's farm.

I hear villagers say the pay is quite good.

Really? I've never worked in their fields before.

You should look into it.

Your load looks heavy, let me carry some.

Don't mind me, I can do it myself.

It's alright, you're pregnant, so let me help you.

Afterour initial meeting that day,

that lady I became closely acquainted.

And I also went to work in Lady Zongkai's fields.

Miss, I've never seen you before.

Where are you from?

I just moved from Muang Loung to this village.

I see.

Are you Aunt Va Cha's daughter-in-law,
Brother Seng's wife?

Yes.

Oh, really!

My name is Pao Choua.

When Brother Seng and I were young,
we used to play together.

Our ages were only slightly apart.

But since Auntie and Uncle Va Cha took brothers
Seng and Chai and moved from here,

we never met again.

Tomorrow, all of you must help me again.

That's if you still really need us.

If you all don't come,
how can I finish the work here?

Why didn't your parents come today?

They are tending our other rice field.

You have quite a small family to own these
many fields.

Who did you work for today to have received so
much rice?

I went to work for Aunt Zongkai.

Oh, Aunt and Uncle Zongkai.

They are never selfish.

They are distantly related to us,

but back when we lived in this village,

our family had a more loving relationship with them
than with our closely related kin.

Were Aunt and Uncle Zongkai there today?

They didn't come.
Only their son Pao Choua came.

Oh, Pao Choua.

He is their youngest son.

He was very talkative as a child.

Is he still like that?

From now on, don't work in anyone else's fields

except in Zongkai's because I know their family
very well.

A long time ago our family owned many fields...

...had wealth...

...and hired many laboring hands just like them.

Our lives were filled with joyful abundance.

We had no worries.

If my son was still here,
you wouldn't have to work so hard.

Even though I don't speak of my husband,

I always think about him.

When my husband was still alive,

he would always help me gather
vegetables forthe hogs.

Those who are orphans,

or widows like me,

will sing our sorrow into a poetic hymn.

My heaven,

my husband.

Is this a good year...

...or an unfortunate year...

...that in my leaving...

...I arrived in these lands.

But the mountains are unlike my own,

the valleys also unlike my own.

Everybody is coupled,

everyone is paired...

...they walk hand in hand,

working side by side.

But I have no one,

I am not paired...

...so I make my sorrowful life...

...like the lost squirrels and birds.

My heaven,

my husband.

Is this a good year...

...or an unfortunate year...

...that in my leaving...

...I arrived in these lands,

But the valleys are unlike my own,

the mountains also unlike my own.

Everyone is paired,

everybody is coupled...

...they walk hand in hand,

they work side by side.

But I have no one,

I am not paired...

...so I make my sorrowful life...

...like the lone squirrels and birds.

My sadness and regret...

...is like the far-off hermit field.

In this lifetime,

I bear the weight of reluctance...

to be my parents' daughter...

...with a lifelong wait for death.

Mother, I'm going to grind these corn.

Remember to drink your medicine.

Yes.

It'll probably take you a while to grind
because there is no one to help.

I'll take my time, Mother.

Sister, the two of you are also grinding corn today?

I don't understand why Sister Xi didn't respond.

Come, let's go.

We're done now, so we'll be on our way.

Alright then.

To use the grinder properly,

one person must grind, the other must feed.

But because I work alone,

I grind a lot of corn at once.

It takes me a long time to finish.

Hello, Pao Choua.

Hi, Auntie.

What errand brings you here?

Oh, I've brought you some rice.

Daughter, come accept this sack of rice from
Pao Choua.

I'm sorry.

Pao Choua.

The sack is heavy so can you help carry it inside?

Have a seat, son.

I still have some errands to run so I'll be on my way.

You should stay awhile.

I'll come again when I'm not too busy.

Do visit soon.

Alright.

There is no firewood nearby to gather,

but going faralone to find wood can be scary.

Gathering wood is a man's job,

but it doesn't mattertoo much if I do it.

The villagers who come this farclaim to have seen
tigers and ghosts,

but I haven't seen any,

and I don't want to either.

These wood are really tough.

I'm not too strong, so this is a real challenge.

I'm so exhausted.

Being alone so much, I talk to myself a lot.

I've been gone a long time,

I wonder how my mother-in-law is doing at home.

She must be worried about me.

I've got to hurry in order to carry some water
before nightfall.

Carrying wood might seem more exhausting
than carrying water, but it is not.

Water is much heavier.

Hello, Pao Choua.

Hi, Auntie.

Come inside.

Alright.

I haven't been feeling well the last few days

so I haven't had the chance to visit your parents.

How are they?

They are well.

Auntie, my father killed one of our cattle today
so I've brought you some meat.

You shouldn't have.

I brought only a small portion.

Sit, Son.

I'm a little busy, so I'll be on my way.

How come you're always bringing us food?

You don't have to be ashamed,

I know you like my daughter-in-law.

If you ever decide to marry her, I wouldn't mind.

This year the two of us may not celebrate the
New Year like others.

It doesn't matter. Next year, we'll celebrate.

Mother, when you have the strength,

will you mind cutting out some paj ntaub designs

for me to embroider?

You're so preoccupied with work,

yet you still want to embroider paj ntaub?

I can sew during leisure moments between work.

During the New Year celebration,
every family makes rice cakes.

Rice cakes are prepared by the men.

My mother-in-law and I won't have any
for the New Year

because we don't have sweet rice

and helping hands.

Mother, who brought these firewood?

Pao Choua brought them.

So, I guess where having rice cakes
for the New Year.

Because we are new here,

we don't have our own cornfield yet.

We've asked to use corn from Pao Choua's family

to feed our animals.

We also gather green vegetables
from Pao Choua's farm.

I don't feel comfortable with Pao Choua
helping us so much.

But since we arrived in this village,

none of my father-in-law's close kin
have offered us anything.

Mother, take off your shirt.

Mother, why are you smiling so much today?

I'm just happy for no particular reason.

Mother, you must stop accepting things
from Pao Choua.

If he brings them, how can I refuse?

Mother.

I'm so old, I don't know how long I have with you.

I want someone to replace me

before my eyes are closed.

Mother, don't speak like that,

I don't want to hear such words.

I only speak of the truth.

I cannot do what you wish for me to do.

Why won't you begin your life again?

So I won't worry so much.

If I begin a new life,

I will have new parents,

I will not be able to bring you with me.

You know well this is our custom.

I will never leave you.

As I've told you before,

I am your people,
in life and in death.

I still have two rice fields at Straw Mountain.

One for sweet rice, the other for plain rice.

I also have a cornfield in the highlands.

These fields have not been worked for many years.

Now the soil is ready for cultivation.

The widow field will not produce...

...let the jungle blossom in its place...

...and ready the soil for swidden farming.

Mother, you're old, but your eyes see clearly

and your hands are quicker than mine.

I don't know, I just work faster.

You do see things before me.

The one who should see works slower.

I don't know.

I must prepare some rice for
the New Yearcelebration.

Although there is only two of us,

we'll still celebrate like others.

Why does my mother-in-law always insist
that I start a new life?

She is always ill.

I wonderwhat I would do if I lose her.

You need to stop bringing things to our house.

You've already helped us enough.

My giving are only acts of communal kinship.

The reason why I've called you clansmen today

is to talk about Brother Seng's wife.

Uncle Va Cha, Brother Seng,
and Brother Chai have died,

leaving behind three widows.

Sister Chai has returned to her clan,

but there are still two widows.

There is no one to take care of them.

That is why...

I've called this meeting.

Among us, I am their closest kin.

So I'm proposing to marry Sister Seng
as my second wife.

That's why I've called upon you all.

In regards to your proposal,

we are all not as close as kin to them as you.

We don't know what to say,

simply because you already have a wife.

Perhaps you must first ask her

to see if she's willing to marry you.

To you clansmen,

regardless of my daughter-in-law's decision,

I am unwilling to accept such a proposal.

You clansmen know well how good
my daughter-in-law is.

Although I have no son as a husband for her,

I have the will to find her a worthy man

before my eyes have closed.

Aunt.

You're old and unwise in these matters.

You shouldn't speak like that.

Since our arrival here to follow the clan,

none of you have been able to offer
us a single meal.

except for the fact that my daughter-in-law must
toil your fields in order to support us.

Now that you've seen her,

you clansmen talk of kinship and community!

If this is what you've called me to talk about,

I have nothing else to say.

Mother!

I told you that I should have accompanied you.

What did the clansmen talk about?

Grandma, where is Sister Seng?

Her mother is very ill.

Panong Lee, I've given your mother medicine.

If your mother gets well, then all is good.

But if she doesn't, you might want to ask Aunt Za

who can sell you the right medicine.

Do you know how much she will charge?

She charges quite heavily.

I have errands to tend to, so I must leave now.

If your mother doesn't get well, let me know.

Thank you for bringing my mother some medicine.

Goodbye.

Mother!

Mother! What's wrong?

Mother, I will go fetch Aunt Za.

Aunt, Aunt, are you home?

Aunt, Aunt, are you home?

Oh, it's you.

Come in, come in, come in.

Aunt, I need some medicine for my mother.

You must explain her sickness,

else I won't know what to give her.

I don't know.

RIght now, her throat seems too tight.

She struggles to speak.

I beg you for medicine.

I'll do anything you ask,
even if I have to work for you.

Well, let me find it.

Here, boil this and have her drink it.

Thank you. I will remember this.

Where have you been?

Mother.

Mother.

Lift me up to sit, Daughter.

I have no strength left in me.

Perhaps I will not recover.

Daughter...

...I thank God that we had the chance...

...to be mother and daughter for a while.

I thank you for the love you've given me.

If only I could hold this moment...

...I would live with you a day longer.

I know well that if I'm gone,

...the clansmen would force you...

...to marry...

...Xi.

I do not wish for you to be Xi's second wife.

Pao Choua...

I know that you love my daughter.

When I am gone...

...will you please marry her?

You must care for her and love her.

Do not let her suffer.

The two of you must love one another.

Mother!
