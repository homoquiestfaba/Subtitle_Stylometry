Although the end of the Cold War

has eliminated the threat
of mutual destruction,

it has brought on a new and equally
terrifying one,

nuclear terrorism.

This week in Beijing, China,

Russian President Boris Yeltsin

and Chinese President Jiang Zemin

signed a historic agreement

to help curb the smuggling of plutonium

and nuclear components
between their countries.

And at the NATO
summit in Brussels,

President Clinton praised
the ongoing reduction

of weapons in the former
Soviet Union.

The agreement that the United States

will sign with Ukraine and Russia

will also make a major contribution

to reducing the proliferation

of weapons of mass destruction.

I believe President Kravchuk
will honor the deal.

They've already started
to dismantle the missiles.

The question that remains

is what happens to the various components
of these missiles

once they've been disassembled.

Unfortunately, international
crime syndicates

are making millions selling plutonium

and other nuclear components

to Third World countries
eager to get the bomb.

These materials are
stored in warehouses

throughout Russia and the Ukraine.

Government officials
are not even sure

how much of it they have.

Barry Wilkes, NATO Headquarters,
Brussels.

They're just fetching water.

What about the dock assignment?

Oh, we're in. Commercial operating
license?

Check.
Oh, our boy comes through
again. Now, we're talking.

All we need is a year's
supply of suntan lotion,

and we are
in the breeze, brother.

Tahiti. Hawaii.
Anywhere but here.

Where else
you wanna go?

I don't care.
Just bring a towel.

As long we're partying
with some ladies.

That's it.

Looking out
at the cool blue.

Ooh-hoo, you know it.
Getting
sunburned, fat.

You're gonna
look good fat, man.

Hey, where the hell
are these party favors?

I think
they forgot about us.

Negative. I'll check
on our guests.

Let's see what
you're doing up there.

All right, you're cool.
How about your buddy?

Where are you?

Oh, that's good.

Yeah, keep coming.
Keep coming.

Nice. Keep coming.

What are you doing?

Don't talk.

Sweet.

Here comes
the pimp.

Here comes
the General.

Where are my guards?

Hang in there, Mikey.

Come on, boys.

Now, my triggers.

Nuclear triggers.

Come on, General.

Go! Go!

Run, Mikey, run!

Come on, Mikey!
I got you!

Nice job.
Welcome back.

That boat is sounding
better, you know?

You ain't lying.

Here. Take a look.

Let me take a look.

They are
killing each other.

Take a look.

Mikey.
Mikey, they're coming
down the hill, man.

Just give me a second.

You about done?

They ain't bringing
cold beer!

Coding.

Good. Jones, it's coded.
Let's go! Let's go!

Go!

Mikey, come on!

Come on, Mike!

Mama!

Get down!

They shot me, Mike.
They got me.

Get me up! Come on.

Come on. Come on.

We're home,
Jonesy baby.

Soon as I rig up,
you just grab on,
you understand?

Let me keep
these guys down.

Give me your hand, man.
Give me your hand!

No...
What are you talking
about? Give me your hand.

No.
Come down.
We don't have time.

You got the best chance
of getting the football
off the field! Now go!

Forget that!
Give me your hand!

You're already out there!
Now, go!

Jonesy, get down here!
Jonesy!

Bye, Mike.

Hey, easy.

Jonesy!

Where the hell
are the triggers?

I dropped them,
but they're off the field.

We got to go back,
there's a man inside.

Negative! Let's get
the hell out of here!

What are you talking about?
Jones is still in there!

The op was nuclear
triggers, not Jones.

I don't give a...
Turn this thing around!

We gotta go back,
and we're gonna
get him out.

Let's get out
of here!
What are you doing?

I'm writing him off.
No.

You know
the rules of the game!

He's a dead man!

Turn it around!
Let's go!

All right, guys,
undo the lines.
Let's shove off.

Come on,  Lady Zen.

Hey, skipper,

I ain't paying while we
sit here while you're
trying to start this canoe.

No problem.
Just give me a minute.

All right.
Just get the hamster back
on the wheel, all right?

Good one.

Hey, Manson
family member,

bring me up a beer.

About time.

Let me give
you a hand there,
Chiquita banana.

I promise
I won't bruise you.

Later, cutie.

No, come on, let's
start with the front.

No.

Hey, cowboy,
keep your hands
to yourself.

Up yours, skipper!

Not again.
What happened?

Son of a...

I think you killed him!

Yeah, he's
dead all right,
dead drunk.

Could have
used that money.
Another late payment.

Can they repo boats?

Donny, up top!

Get this
off my boat.
Yes, sir!

Luther,
give him a hand!
Yes, sir.

Hey, Church, go downstairs
and check the fuel pump!

All right.

Yes!

Hey, Chique, Donny,

listen to that baby purr!
We're back in business!

It's nice to see you,
too, Weston.

I'm gonna go down
and get another beer.

I suggest you be gone
by the time I get back.

Hey, you might want
to take a look at this.

So, two of them come
on at once, and I ain't
touch nobody's girl.

And all of a sudden, fwop!
One goes into splits.

One bottled water, please.

Did he say
"bottled water"?

Oh, soldier boy.

Nothing like a handsome
wool-polyester blend

to help beat
the heat, huh?

Say "grunt."

Do I know you?

No, you're just
an ugly reminder

of a nightmare
we once lived,
Sergeant...

Blakely.

You were Marines?

Hella strange,
but true.

Oh! You're what
they call washouts.

Careful, Sarge.
You'll find out why
we washed out first hand.

And you wouldn't
want that.

Hey, check it out.
Brass, 5 o'clock.

Hey, that's Colonel Wolfe
to you, beach bum.

This prison
is in Kwong Li?

Yeah, it's a couple
of miles

from that bridge
where your op when sour.

Intelligence thinks
our friend, the General,

is trying to process
weapons-grade plutonium
in that hole.

Surprised you haven't
leveled the place.

I planned on it.

And then last week,
one of our satellites
shot those.

And I realized,
"If that's Jones, then..."

It's him.

Why are you here, Wolfe?

Do you need a positive
I.D. on Jones,

or do you need me to
go back in and get him?

Look, if it were up to me,
I wouldn't even be here.

But it seems you two got
some fans at Langley
and at the Pentagon.

Ooh! Whoopee-doo.

That and the fact that
you're expendable make
you the ripest candidate

for this mission.

Besides, you might
get a second shot

at those triggers.

We don't have
much intelligence
on the prison.

It seems that nobody
that goes in there
comes out alive.

I want into Lang Son.

I want a chopper
at a designated point

10 minutes
from my radio signal.

And I want to be
left alone.

Done deal.

I'm gonna be
at the consulate.

But remember,
you're not supposed
to be in there,

and neither is Jones,
so you're on your own.

Hey, I may live.
I doubt it.

Hey, Wolfe!

This warm
and fuzzy attitude,
it's not like you.

How come you didn't
just take out Jones
and the whole place

with one big bang?

I couldn't get it
approved.

I thought you said
you weren't taking
any more missions.

It's not a mission.

Man, we saw
the brass.
How long you gonna be gone?

You can't just go.
I mean, what are
we gonna do?

What am I,
a damn baby-sitter?

I don't know what
you're gonna do. Plenty
of nothing is my guess.

I should be back
in a couple of weeks.

Other than that,
it's a need-to-know
basis, okay?

Here. Keep her clean
and running, all right?

No, no, no.
I'm busy.

Cab, mister?

You got
air conditioning?

It's good to see you,
my friend.

Long time, no see.

Yeah, long time.

Long time.

I saw her first.

Wait. What...

Uh, excuse me. I'm looking
for the owner of that boat.

You've found him.

That's strange.
I thought Mike Weston
owned that boat.

Well, uh, he does.

We do. We own a boating
operation of sorts.

I gave him
the week off.

You know Mike?

Yeah, but I didn't
catch your name.

It's Kat.
Well, my friends
call me Kat.

But you can
call me Katherine.

Ah, humor.

Ding, ding.

Round two.

I bet she's gonna
mess him up.

You're on, Chique.

Perhaps you and I
could go out

for a little
sunset cruise.

Look, I really need
to see Mike Weston.

How about a drink?
Chique, put two
daiquiris on my tab.

What tab?

She's kidding.
Mmm-hmm.

Um, what did you say
your name was again?
Donny.

Donny. Donny.
Donny, I need to ask
you some questions,

and you need
to answer them.

And if you persist
with this lame line
of yours,

I'm gonna have
to hurt you.

Bad.

Hey, I'm here for you.

How about
that drink?

My name is
Katherine Weston,

and I'm looking for
my brother, Mike Weston.

Mike has a sister?

If he did,
that'd be her.

That is his boat out there.

I'd like to
go onboard.

I think I'll
take you out to the boat now.

Good boy.

Is this all you have?

All right.

All right, set a meeting
between me and the Triads.

Tell them I need
a detailed map of
the prison at Kwong Li.

Get me something
I can use, Phred.

Sure, but they
are dangerous.

I'll get some men
to go with you.

No, no.
Okay, just you and me.

Listen, you just
set the meeting,

then you and I
don't talk anymore
in Vietnam.

I want to help
break Jonesy out.

Who said
anything about Jonesy?

The two of you went
into Kwong Li,

and only one
of you came out.

Now you want to
break somebody out
of Kwong Li Prison.

Here.

What's this?
A ticket and some money.

You're taking
a vacation, Phred.

A nice, long vacation
in Tahiti.

You leave tomorrow morning.

I've arranged it
so you get through.

You need me
in Vietnam, Mike.

Damn it, Phred,
listen to me.

You're getting on that plane
first thing tomorrow morning,
you understand?

Promise me you're
gonna be on that plane.

Okay, okay.

What?

You sound like you
don't want to come back.

Mike hasn't called home
or written in over a year.

My mom's been
having a fit.

Do you guys
have the key
to this room?

No.
That's Mike's room.

Out of my way.

Look, you
really shouldn't
be doing this.

I'm his kid sister.
What's he gonna do?

Actually, we're not
concerned for you.

Who's that?

That's Jonesy.

He and your brother
were our special tactics
training officers.

You were in
the military?

Why does everybody
keep saying that?

Well, maybe he can
help us find Mike.

He's dead.

I'm sorry.

Check.

So, uh, how come
you guys aren't
in uniform now?

It was time to leave.

Yeah, and get
kicked out.

We had this sergeant
who didn't like us
very much.

No.

One night, he and
his buddies decided
to beat us.

Which they didn't.

But he did
have us arrested
for beating his...

That's true.
Why aren't you guys
in jail now?

We would be if it wasn't
for your brother.

Only one that believed us
over the Sarge.

To freedom.

May our days
be long and lazy!

Checkmate.

So, what do
you guys do now?

We work for your brother.
We're crewing on his boat.

We're just hanging out
in Tahiti for a while.

And soon we shall
sail around the world.

When?

Uh, I don't know.

Whenever the time
is right, I guess.

Well, looks like
you guys

have got yourselves
some company.

Nightie-night.

I'm coming!

No! Jonesy!

Jonesy!

Police! Sit down!
Sit down!

Okay, okay.
Okay, easy.
Take it easy.

Be cool.

Sir, we found nothing.

Check the bathroom.

Sir, we found this.

You got to be kidding.

Wake up, slugs!

Wake up, slugs!

Urgent phone call
for you at the bar.

Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down, slow down.

Who is this? Phred?
Phred with a "P"?

Okay. Oh.

What? What is it?
Is it Mike?

Mike's been arrested.

Good morning,
Agent Weston.

Or Mike, if I may.

Would you happen
to know

what is
the mandatory sentence

for smuggling drugs
into my country?

More than a slap
on the wrist,
I'm sure.

Life.

But just like
the Chief of Police,

the honorable judge here,

he's a good friend of mine.

He's going to hand down
a death sentence.

Well, you might
wanna run that by the
U.S. consulate first.

A CIA agent is sneaking
back into my country

with false identification?

But I'm in no hurry
to have you killed.

As a matter of fact,

I am prepared to have you
flown back to Tahiti.

Well, guess I'll be
on my way then, huh?

Give me back
the nuclear triggers

that you stole from me.

Intelligence has it

that you secured
these triggers

in a case with
a self-destruct
mechanism.

And that case
never left Vietnam.

Nuclear triggers?

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Weston, why do you think
you are here,

to save Jones?

Where is he?

Give me back
the triggers,

and the two of you
can fly out together.

Together? Is Jones
sitting next to me,

or is he in a body bag
in cargo?

My guess is that we're
both in body bags, right?

Mike...

Listen to me.

The war between
our countries,

America and Vietnam,
it's over now.

Believe me
when I tell you
we are not arming

against
the United States.

General...

You have been given
some false intelligence.

The triggers
did make it back
to my superiors.

I've got nothing
to give you.

Neither does Jones,

but you probably
already know that, right?

Well, I see.

How regrettable.

You failed
to take advantage

of this small conversation
between you and me.

Because, I fear,

it will be a lot messier
if you have to talk later.

This man here,

he is Dr. Liu.

Mike, he is
not really a doctor.

Don't shoot!
I need him alive!

Sound the general alarm!
The prisoner is on the loose!

Mama!

Phred with a "P."
You Donny?

Yeah, yeah, let's go.
U.S. consulate, now.

Phred, I advise you
not to question her.

You're going to do
what she wants you
to do anyway.

That way,
no one gets hurt.

Son of a...

Put him in the truck!

You're going home,
your new home.

Okay, guys, I'll wait
right here for you.

All right, kid.

Okay, so, who
do we talk to here?

Well, look who's here.

What the hell are
you misfits doing here?

Look, uh, we need
to talk to your
colonel now,

so why don't you
pick up your little
phone there and...

Get him and his
pleasant demeanor
out here, soldier boy?

I'm not with them,

but I do wish to see
the Colonel, Sergeant...

Blakely, ma'am.

You see, Sergeant,

my brother,
a highly-decorated Marine,

is in some sort of trouble
here in Vietnam,

and I really need to
talk with your colonel.

You keep
that bunch corralled,

I'll see what I can do.

The U.S. government
is doing everything they can
to get him out of this mess.

Our attache is
running back and forth.

Look, my brother
is no dope dealer.

Your being here is
not a help, Miss Weston.

If anything, you're going
to attract the foreign press.

Good.
No, not good.

"Ex-Marine drug addict
caught with heroin
in Vietnam."

Drug addict?
A headline like that

is not going to get him
any sympathy.

Now, the best thing that
you can all do for him

right now is to leave.

I've already arranged
for your travel.

You what?

Sergeant Blakely here
will escort you.

You are
so full of...

We know that you
brought Mike here.

Sergeant Blakely,

escort our friends here
to the conference room

so they can wait
for their ride.

Yes, sir.

They're not going to
help him, you know that.

Is this your attempt to
cheer me up, soothe me?

Sorry.

Good
afternoon, Sergeant.

Luther,
give me a cigarette.

What?
Give me a cigarette.

What, I can't go
out for a smoke?

Go ahead.

Jonesy.

Jonesy!

Mike?

Get against the bars

if you want to
keep your boots.

You know we're
their entertainment!

They enjoy the show!

You know!

What the hell
are you doing here?

I'm here
to rescue you.

Well, you're doing
a great job so far.

Yeah, you should have
told me you were
having a party.

Right.

I wish to God
you weren't here.

I don't know
why I'm not dead.

Why is he keeping me
alive, Mikey?

Why does Nguy
keep asking me

about his nuke triggers?

I blew it, Jonesy.

I dropped the ball.

The triggers never
made it back.

Move it!

Here! Here!
Over here!

Faster!

Move it! They're getting away!
Come on!

Come on, back up!
Back up!

Get out of the way!

Phred, they're
on your tail!

Phred, look out!

Damn!

One down!
One down!

Go! Faster!
Get 'em!

The beer! The beer!

Phred wants the beer.
He wants a drink?

No, I mean the bottles!
The bottles!

No, he means the bottles!
The bottles.!

The bottles!
The bottles!

Look out!
Look out for the bottles.

Slow down.
Slow down, Phred.

One, two, three!

Son of a...

Look at you!

Now, listen, you got to
tell me what the hell's
going on, Phred.

Why did Mike come
back to Lang Son?

Come on, Phreddy, you're
not helping him now,
you're hurting him.

They're going
to kill him, man.

Mike came here to
break someone out
of Kwong Li Prison.

The place he's
being held in now?

Who? Who was he
going to break out?

His name is Jones.

Jonesy's alive?

How close is Nguy
to weapons-grade plutonium?

I don't know, Mike.

He's got a bunch
of guys moving around
a lot of toxic...

Is he going to be able
to reverse-engineer

the triggers if he gets
ahold of them?

Mike, don't.

I don't want to
think about this stuff.

I mean, I don't want
to hear this stuff.

I can't hold this
kind of information.

Jonesy, I'm not giving
you any information.

No, I...

Mike, you're a lot
tougher than I am.

I mean, there's stuff
going on around...

There's stuff
going on around here!

Okay, okay, okay, relax.
Take a breath.

Take a breath.

I just need to
hear what you know
to get us out.

I know...

It's okay. Forget it.
We'll talk about it later.

One step
at a time.
Okay.

Listen, you
holding out okay?

Yeah. Yeah, fine.

It's good to see you.

Back together again,
right, Jonesy?

Just like old
times, huh?
Yeah.

Yeah, there's
the Jonesy I know.

The light that comes
through those windows

this time of day
is so beautiful,

you can almost
float away on it.

Sometimes...

Sometimes, I just
float away on it.

Yeah.

No.

What's on
the program here?

What is it?

You just hang
in there, Mike.

Don't think about me.
Just hang in there.

Wait. Wait. Hey.

Let me go.
Stay out of this.

Jonesy... Hey.

What's
going on here?

Wow, this place
is creepy.

Nobody wants
to come here.

That's why
it's safe.

Come on, guys.

We're all set.

Tomorrow morning, we buy
the plan of the prison.

Mike left me
some cash.

Thank you, Phred.

One thing.

These men selling
the plan are dangerous,

Triad.
Gangsters.

Great.
Great.

Would you happen
to know

how much plutonium
will it take to blow up,

say, New York City?

You set that off
in Central Park,

they probably won't be
trading on Wall Street
the next morning.

Really, Mike, I like you,

but I still
have to have my triggers.

You are wasting
your time.

Let's get it on.

You going to work
me over personally,

or do you
just like to watch?

Nobody is going
to work you over.

Oh, my God.

The smell...

It takes time before
you get used to it.

But we're lucky,
there is a little
breeze tonight.

Hey, Mike.

Hey, Jonesy.
I'm right here.

Apparently, you did
not tell your friend
what I need to know.

Now I'm
appealing to you directly.

Where are the triggers
and what is the code?

Don't tell them a thing.

Mike?
Go to hell,
you sicko.

They can't hurt me,
right, Mike?

'Cause I've been here
too many times, right, Mike?

Come on, tell me.

Mike, come on, say it!

Th... That's right, they
can't hurt you, Jonesy.

That's right.

I'm not feeling
a thing, right?

Right, right.
They can't hurt you.
No way. You're the man.

That's right,
I'm the man.

I just roll it up in a big
blue ball, right, Mike,

and roll it on out
of here, right, Mike?

That's right, Jonesy.

Jonesy!

Jonesy. Jonesy,
can you hear me? Huh?

Damn it.

I'm beginning to lose
my patience with you.

You don't even
amuse me anymore.

I'm going to rip
your heart out.

I have no heart.

Dr. Liu, proceed.

Don't! No!
All right! All right.

I'll give you
the triggers.

You will tell me
where they are

and you will
give me the code.

No. No! I'll take you
to them, both of us!

I give you the triggers,
you let us go.

I'm not going to leave
him here with that animal.

No way.

Deal.

Set it up.
There's four of them.

He wants to
see the money.

Yeah, well, what do
we get for the money?

Map of the prison,
the guard schedule.

It's the same plan
they used to break out
his cousin.

Totally guaranteed.
How much?

How much you got?

Excellent.

You stick with them.

I'm going
to call Captain Fau

and have every single one
of them deported. Right.

Yes, it's
Mike Weston's sister.

Look, I think we can
avoid an ugly situation

if, uh, your local
police would escort
them to a plane.

Yes, Colonel Wolfe.

We'll take them
immediately to the airport.

Thank you,
Colonel Wolfe.
Thank you.

Cool!
Now that
we got the plans,

can you get us
some weapons?

You have no weapons?

Oh.

Please empty your pockets
of all valuables,

jewelry,
oh, and watches, too.

So long, clown people.

Church!

Phreddy, what was
this all about?

These are
General Nguy's men.

I suggest we go now.

How the hell
did they find us?

Good guy coming out!

Good guy
coming out.

Holy...

Sarge, we've got guns now
and we're not going with you.

Let's go on river.
I've got a boat there.

Hang up.
I'm not trying to
hold you. I swear.

Did you hear me?

Colonel Wolfe,
the situation here is

a lot worse
than I thought.

You're an idiot.

Get them
on the plane!

The police didn't show,
soldiers did.

Look, Sergeant,
I'm going to let you in
on a little something,

Mike Weston is expendable,

and we don't give
a damn about his sister
or those kids, either.

Sir, they're escaping.

You bringing
reinforcements, huh?

You got one.

I'm coming
with you.
No way, sweetheart.

Fine.

Oh, one thing?

I owed you that.

I'm going to
rip your face...
Hey, knock it off!

God, like there wasn't
enough testosterone
in this place already?

Hey! Hey,
are you a dog?

How about you?

You don't understand
a word I'm saying
to you, do you?

No. Hey, Jonesy,
you hear me?

What, Mike?

This is it.
We're on.

What are you talking about?

We're getting the
hell out of here.

I can't. I'm too tired.

You don't have
to do anything.
Just follow my lead.

No, you make your move.

I don't want to
slow you down.

Six miles
to the pickup.
Six miles.

I'll carry you
if I have to.

We on?

Hey, hey! We on?

Yeah, we're on.
That a boy.

Hey, Phred, how far
away is the prison?

Six miles,
maybe seven.

Pull these things over.

We go the rest
of the way on foot.

Why? We're cruising
in style.

We're too close
to the prison to
be on this river.

Uh, jughead, who...
Who put you in charge?

If you want to get
out of this thing alive,

we've got to
start functioning
as a military unit.

I knew this was
going to happen.

Big man had
to take control.

We should have shot him
back at the warehouse.

All right,
we'll vote.

Vote? We don't
need to vote.

Look out!
Oh, no.

Get down!
Get down!

Turn around!
Turn around now!

Get to the shore!

Jump!
Jump!

Mr. Nguy, you want me
going down the hole,

you're going to have
to take these off.

What's it going to be?

Can't rappel down
a hole with cuffs on,
can you, now, Jonesy?

Now!

In the hole!

My hands!

Come on! Come on!
Which way?

Go, go.

Hurry up with those ropes!
They might escape again!

Drop them!
Drop the ropes!
Now go!

Mike, the cuffs.

Hold your fire, killer!

Hold your fire.

They're all dead.

Direct hit.

We had to bail.
They knew
we were coming.

You know what they
say about your life
flashing before your eyes?

I saw it all, man.

I'm such a loser.

Where's Kat?

Come on.

Way too high.

I know.

Doing it.

Take a deep breath
and follow me.

Okay.

Give me the code.

We'll get rid
of this box,
and we're out of here.

Triggers don't come out
until we're off the field.
You know that?

No. It'll only
slow us down.

Give it to me.
I'll carry it.
No!

Give me the code.

We'll leave
the triggers here.
He'll let us go.

What are you
talking about?

Mike, I'm trying
to save us.

Give me the box.

No! No!
Give me the code!

Give me the box.
No!

Here!
Here's the triggers!

Here!
Here's the triggers!

Here! Here!

Here they are!
Come and get them!

Here's the triggers!

The code!

The code.

Shoot him.

Shoot him!

That's them.

But no Kat.
I say we wait.

We wait,
maybe she dies.

Maybe we wait,
and we find out
where she is down there.

Maybe they find us.

We dig in for the night.

Disappear.
I'm digging in now.

I vote we wait.

Yeah, me, too.

I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

What if we go in,
and we can't find her?

It's not like
we're going to get
a second chance.

Hey, man, he was fully
right about the boats.

Come on, man.
Just 'cause he's a sarge
doesn't make him wrong.

I don't know
about Church being
the voice of reason, man.

Yeah, it's not
attractive on him at all.

He's right.
Let's dig in.

Home, sweet home.

He would've
let us go, you know.

Let us go?

Do you think
he was going to
let us just walk out?

As soon as he gets
the code, we're dead!

Maybe.

Nice cheap shot, Mike.

Why? Why did you
give him the triggers?

Who gives...
who has the triggers?

You think the CIA
or Colonel Wolfe

cares about you or me?

No, this has nothing
to do with Wolfe!

This has to do with
doing the right thing!

Think of all the people
he's going to kill
with those triggers.

Personally, I don't
care if he blows up
this whole country...

Oh, man...
...because I'm not
going to be here.

He's not even
close to having
weapons-grade plutonium,

and without that,
the triggers
are useless.

Listen to yourself.

Oh, man,
listen to yourself.

You say it over and over,
and maybe you'll start
believing it.

Oh, maybe
I'm not thinking
too clearly right now,

but I'll tell you
one thing, partner!

A year of torture
will do that to you!

You gave me up,
didn't you?

You gave them
my name.

You saw what
they did to me.

You saw.

I never would've
given you up.

Never!

Yeah, I gave you up, Mikey.

I told them I once had
a good friend

named Mike Weston.

And you dropped
the football!

Because of you,
they kept me alive!

Because of you,
I went through
a year of hell!

It should've
been you in here
for the last year.

Not me.

Don't you think
I know that?

Don't you think
I've thought about that

every night
for the last year?

You're right.

It should've been me.

Yeah.

It should've been me.

Gentlemen, such
a lovely day outside.

I'm inviting you
for a stroll.

Jones?

He gave you the code?

Oh, yeah.

Well?

Hey, guys.

If you got a plan,
we're with you, Sarge.

We better
make it fast.

An American girl?

It's my kid sister.

Mike, my patrol,

they found your friends
from Tahiti.

Hold fire!

Now the choice
is yours.

This,

or this.

No. no, no.
11-15-60.

11-15-60.

That's your code.

Your birthday?

You will
open it for me.

Come out. Come out.

Open it.

Open it!

Wait, wait.

01...

08...

35.

Elvis's birthday.

What you have
helped happen

is nothing
to be ashamed of.

You, your friends,

your sister,

all of you will not
have died in vain.

Defend the bunker!

Kat, get down!
Get down!

All right,
everybody stay alert!

Base, this is General Nguy.

Laboratory under attack.

Send in reinforcements now!

Donny?
Here, Donny.

Get him in the truck.
Come on. Come on.

Here we go.

All right, listen up.

Two miles down the road,
there's a clearing.

You wait for us there,
you understand?

Yeah.

Give me the gun.
See you, Luther.

You okay?
Yeah.

Go, go!

That's all?
I don't hear no fat lady.

She ain't singing to me.

Firecracker?
Yeah.

You ever get that boat?
Oh, yeah.

Nice?
Sweet.

Time for reinforcements.

You read my mind.

Hang on, guys!

Lock and load!

Out!
Everybody out!

Mike, no.
I've got the good...

Clear! Clear!

This is General Nguy!
Where the hell are you?

They're leaving!
They're leaving.

Tank!

Let's go! Run!

Come on, Donny,
come on!

Run! Go!

Run! Run!

Ready.

Come on!

Operation Nomad.

Operation Nomad,
I am trigger-happy.

Repeat, I am trigger-happy.

We've got a flight to catch.

Bring it on.

Let's split up.
Meet you at the chopper.

You guys all right?

Come on, get in.
Get in. Hurry up.

Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

Hurry! Come on.

Hurry! Hurry!
Get in! Get in!

I'm going back
for Jones!
Hell, no!

I'm not taking
nuclear triggers
back with no...

Jones was the op,
not the triggers.

Go, go!

Never again.

Mike!

Lower it, lower it!
Come on!

Come on, bring it in!
That's it!

Bring it down!
Lower! Come on, come on!

A few more feet!
A few more feet! Come on!

Bring it down!

Lower it!
Lower it! Come on!

Come on! Grab on!

Go, go!

Hey, guys.
Hey,
get on board.

Look, we've done
some thinking.

Yeah, it's too unproductive
to hang with you guys.

About time
we did something
with our lives, man.

So we decided not to go
to Hawaii with you.

You sure I can't
change your mind?

No, sir.

Nah, they're right, Mike.

They should seek
their own destiny.
Good luck, guys.

Mike! Mike! Jonesy!

We're ready!

To freedom!

May our days
be long and lazy!

How you doing, Jonesy?

Very good.

Hawaii ho!

Get up there, boy!
