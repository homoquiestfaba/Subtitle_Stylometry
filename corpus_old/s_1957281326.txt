(heavily exhaling)

Sam, Sam, listen.

Sam, Sam, look at me.

Sam, Sam, look at me.
Everything's gonna be fine,

Barry.
Don't do this, Sam.

Sam, listen to me,
look at me, Sam.

Sam, look at me.

â™ª â™ª

Sammy, don't do this,
please, Sam, don't do this.

Please, Sam, don't do this!

Sam, please,
don't do this, please.

No!

Do you trust me?

â™ª â™ª

You'll never know my potential
if you don't give me the chance.

â™ª â™ª

No.
Isn't it wiser to use me?

If not, you'll lose everything.

No.
Think of your wife.

â™ª â™ª

(birds chirping)

â™ª â™ª

Lilly.
Please stay there.

Don't you think she needs this?

I need some explanation.

Some reason for all of this.

Finding myself here early
and waiting for an answer

is all I can remember.

Never expected
to see you like this.

It seems impossible.

You said "early."

â™ª â™ª

That can't be.

Are you saying that I'm dead?

â™ª â™ª

No!

â™ª â™ª

No!

â™ª â™ª

No!

â™ª â™ª

No!

Please, don't do this!

â™ª â™ª

No!

Help me out of here!

Help!

No!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


(birds chirping)

(dog panting)

I tried to save you,

but I was deceived.

As soon as I tried
to save your life,

you were taken from me.

I don't understand.

Saved me how?

â™ª â™ª

I don't wanna hear your excuses.

I only wanna hear what
you have to say for yourself.

None of this makes any sense.
I'm not here

to dodge any bullets.

I've been waiting for a chance
to explain everything to you.

And I feel like
the more that you know,

you will grow
in understanding and trust.

Just like I did.

â™ª â™ª

It all began when everybody
started talking about

this life-saving antidote.

An antidote?

Well, ironically
it was disguised.

Something that would take lives

turned into something
that could save...

In "disguise,"
what do you mean by that?

â™ª â™ª

Bullets, Lillian.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

I don't know
if this is the right time

to bring this up, but...
What is it?

â™ª â™ª

I'm your mom, I'll always be
your mom no matter what,

and every mother
will do anything

to make their daughter happy.

Right?

There's just something
about your death

I think that you should know.

â™ª â™ª

There was a man

who came to me.

â™ª â™ª

He had a bullet.

And this wasn't a bullet that
you could buy at the store.

I didn't really know him
back then when he came to me.

We weren't close or anything,

and he had a bullet, claiming
that this bullet could talk.

I mean, Lilly, come on,
a talking bullet.

â™ª â™ª

But listen.

He's good.

He's really good.

â™ª â™ª

I just think about
all of the lives,

all of the stories of the lives
that were being saved.

(indistinct whispering)

â™ª â™ª

At first these were
just stories to me.

But these stories...

these stories
made me realize that I had

taken life for granted,

and I watched these stories.

I watched them come true

right before my very eyes.

And the old man,
he was really convincing.

He was sweet and kind,
and so easy to trust.

He chose to save you
over his very own wife.

â™ª â™ª

His own wife?

His own wife was very sick.

She had people
coming to the house to help.

Like I did.
Yeah.

I never knew about her, though,

before everything.

They had many good people
coming by the house to help,

but you don't come back from...
Wait, then the old man

had never used the bullet
for as long as he's had it.

How long has he had it for?

â™ª â™ª

I don't know, it was easy
to overlook at the time.

It wasn't what I was focused on.

You see, I needed her.

She started talking to me,

and I heard her,
and she said that

she would make
everything right, Lillian.

That she would make
everything right for us.

â™ª â™ª

Who is she?

â™ª â™ª

The bullet.

â™ª â™ª

Then what happened?

â™ª â™ª

It didn't work.

â™ª â™ª

It wasn't what they said it was.


So, it was you?
No.

You did it to me.
No, no.

You killed me.


â™ª â™ª

I must've been a burden for you.

No, you were never
a burden to me.

I'm your mother.
You were my mother.

You were never a burden to me.

I was prepared to take
any bullet for you.

I tried to kill myself.

I couldn't bear to live
after you were

taken away from me.

But you didn't kill yourself.

I couldn't, but I did.

(hysterically crying)

What have you done?

You tried to sabotage me
from the beginning!

Was that your plan?

Talk to her,
see what her plan is!

See if she can fix this!

I'm so sorry.
You better fix this.

You better fucking fix this
or I will kill you!

So, he just killed himself?

After the accident,
he had so much guilt.

It was overwhelming for him.

But you don't do that.

What do you mean?

That guilt was
so overwhelming for him.

No, that's just
a useless excuse.

But maybe that was just
his way of releasing it.

He wasn't punishing himself.

He was escaping it.

(birds chirping)

I guess this is better now
than what I had.

Don't say that, Lillian.

No, maybe it's true.

Such a terrible feeling
to sometimes hear

the things around you.

I felt like I was
drowning in myself.

Such a torture
that no one knows.

Living meant nothing.

In a way I was set free
the day I found myself here.

So, ask what you came to ask.

Not yet.

(door closing)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

How could you do that?

â™ª â™ª

You lied.


You really thought
you could do it, didn't you?

â™ª â™ª


Even when someone's life
is at stake,

you just can't
leave it to chance

just because you wanna
prove something to yourself.

â™ª â™ª

I thought I could save a life.

How am I gonna fix this?

â™ª â™ª

What do you expect me to say?

â™ª â™ª

Nothing.

â™ª â™ª

I've always wanted
to be the one

to give people
second chances in life.

You had me convinced.

(water flowing, stops)

Now I know
I'm just a normal bullet.

â™ª â™ª

Because what do bullets do?

â™ª â™ª

They kill.

No one asked me
what I want out of this,

to be the one
to kill or to save.

â™ª â™ª

When the moment comes
and that trigger's pulled,

it's all decided by
who's behind the trigger.

â™ª â™ª

You may have wanted to be
someone's angel,

just to save lives.

But taking lives
is just as important.

I never blame you,

because...

â™ª â™ª

(latches clicking)

Please, Cal.

â™ª â™ª

No one forced you to do this.

This is just me being a doctor.

Have you considered
what she wants?

â™ª â™ª

What if she wants to stay dead?

She's already
been through so much.

Nothing,
I'm not gonna do anything.

But I'm not gonna avoid
my responsibility

and just let her lie here.

And just so you know,

it wasn't because of me.

â™ª â™ª

It wasn't because of me.

She was killed
because of rumors.

She was killed because she was
trying to find the right person.

And don't expect her
to thank you

for doing this or something.

She will run far away

in this tiny town

as soon as she opens those eyes.

That is exactly my wish for her.

She trusted me with
those bullets that night.

And just so you know,

one day you're gonna
pull the trigger

and find out that I'm gone.

Ha, what,
when we don't need you anymore?

Hopefully.

By the way,

how many bullets
do we have left?

â™ª â™ª

I'm ready.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(spoon clinking)


He's here.

She'll wake up soon.

â™ª â™ª

Wow, look at you.

I must be doing my job well.

How you doing?

Good, now that you're here.

Have you head anything to eat?

Cal, can I get you
another glass of wine,

beer, soda, or something?

Well, just water, please.

Sure.

â™ª â™ª


Say when.

â™ª â™ª

Oh, thank you, that's good.

My favorite.

â™ª â™ª

So, you've heard
of this scientist that

uses water to try to prove
your thoughts can alter

physical reality.

Japanese one.

Mm, you know him?

Interesting guy, huh?

Interesting.

Kind of strange, you know.

How's that?

I mean, who studies water?

I mean, until someone can
turn it into an art form,

and now everyone
wants to know about it.

Yeah, that's true, I guess.

â™ª â™ª

Cal, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

Sure.

â™ª â™ª

What is he trying to say?

He's trying to
tell you something.

Hey, you can...
you can talk to me, Barry.

What... what's up?

Better ask first.

It's nothing.

Hey.

We've been through so much.

We've come all this way.

You can... you can talk to me.

What's going on?

Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can work it out.

A man with a gun.

Let me see your hands,
let's see your hands.

After the old man
killed himself,

they investigated his letter.

Once they put
all the pieces together,

they determined
it was suicide.

(distant sirens)

(indistinct police radio)

â™ª â™ª

Hey, can you hear me?

â™ª â™ª

Don't get me wrong.

Listen, I'm just trying
to protect my wife

from something bad
happening to her.

That's why I wanted
to see you tonight.

â™ª â™ª

Cal,

I'm such a coward.

What?

There's gonna come a time,

and you're gonna know
when that time is,

when I'm gonna want you
to deliver this for me.

â™ª â™ª

Timing's gotta be right.

It's absolutely imperative.

I can't afford
to mess this up.

(envelope rustles)

â™ª â™ª

(indistinct remarks)

â™ª â™ª

Pretty sure he's dead, but...

â™ª â™ª

What kind of letter?

He made a farewell letter,

and it was found
next to the body.

â™ª â™ª

(sirens blaring)

â™ª â™ª

(indistinct police radio)

â™ª â™ª

Things would not be the same
for the family.

The benefits that
they receive now would be gone.

Becomes a difficult situation
when suicide's involved.

When there's nobody left
to be held accountable,

there is no excuse.

Death is death.

Well, if his death

affects the life
of someone else,

whatever helps.

I thought they ruled that out,

like you wrote here,

but if that's the case...

â™ª â™ª

Well, then,

I owe you one.

I guess now I know
what I have to do.



Sam, I can see your car.

â™ª â™ª

They called it
"the white bullet."

Like white lies.

But why would you
have to tell a lie?

Everyone lies, Lillian.

We had to tell tell lies
to protect ourselves

from people.

â™ª â™ª

Not everyone could get
their hands on these bullets.

â™ª â™ª

How so?

Well, it's not like you could
just go to the store

and get one of these.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(door opens)

â™ª â™ª

It's me.

I need to tell you something.
No, no.

I need to...
This is not right.

â™ª â™ª

(door closes)

â™ª â™ª

You kidding me,
are you kidding me?

Is this some kind of joke?

I watched you die.
What?

â™ª â™ª

What are you a fucking ghost?

What are you doing back here?

I don't believe
in superstitions,

you son of a bitch.

You did one time.
Yeah.

Took away
the most important thing

I loved in this world.

Sam, you've gotta listen to me.

Shut up, shut up.

I should've never gotten
involved with those bullets

to begin with.

You used them,
you had the bullets.

You used them on yourself.

No, no, I didn't, no.
That's what you did.

I didn't.
You found a way to use them

on yourself.
Sam, I didn't, no.

Why did you come here?

Why did you come to see me?

You're either stupid or brave.

You figure it out.
Sam,

I think I found it.
Yeah, why should I believe

anything that you say?
Well, it came to me.

I don't believe
anything you say.

Look at me.

I'm back.

â™ª â™ª

I'm right here.

I'm back.

From the dead.

â™ª â™ª

Back from the dead.

I just thought it was
the old man all along.

They used it on me.

"They used it on me," he said.

â™ª â™ª

And you know me, Lillian.

You know that I never
would've done anything

unless I saw this for myself,

unless I was convinced.

I mean,

I still remember his hands,

his eyes,

his reddish gray hair.

He was right in front of me.

â™ª â™ª

And he said to me...

It was one of the doctors
in the morgue.

One of the doctors?

Then he's the one
who had the white bullets.

Who has the white bullets.

â™ª â™ª

Where and how?

Where did they use it on you?
How... how did they decide

to use it on you?
I don't know,

I just woke up.

Woke up? Hm.

11, 11 and a half?

Thanks.

I mean, he finds validation

in people that he helps.

He's got his own set
of moral codes.

â™ª â™ª

What about my daughter?

I mean, you're acting
like you know the guy.

Did you even see his face?

Sam, I told you,
I didn't see his face.

I... look, I'm just grateful
for what he did.

I don't speak for them,
but you're acting like

you came here,
and, I mean,

I'm surprised you just
came here to see me,

that you would come
to see me first.

But still, I...

But still...
This is it.

She's gonna want to meet him.
They must've found out.

I mean, why would they help
a miserable old man like me?

Well, when it comes
to the story,

we only know
part of the whole.

The thing is, so do they.

I told you.

Let's leave.

Wait a minute.

You wanna meet him?

The man who saved my life?

We've done our job.

She's just gonna do
what she wants to.

You don't even know who he is
or where to find him.

I'm not going.

We are, let's go.

To be honest with you, though,

I had to trust my instincts
at that point.

I couldn't let my curiosity
cloud my view.

â™ª â™ª

Your curiosity?

Lilly, I had to have
a clear conscience

before I came to you
and asked for your forgiveness.

â™ª â™ª

So, I followed him.
Sam.

â™ª â™ª

Again, I'm sorry
for what happened.

You say that
after you fix this.

â™ª â™ª

(engine starts)

â™ª â™ª

The doctor.

â™ª â™ª

See, the doctor was
the key to all of this.


You know,
sometimes the truth sucks,

and it hurts.

â™ª â™ª

We tell ourselves
what we want to believe,

â™ª â™ª

I became wary of everything.

I started studying the details.

â™ª â™ª

Which just made me
more skeptical.


(wind chimes tinkling)


(wind chimes tinkling)



Hello?

I could never forgive myself

for what had happened to you.

I mean,
if there had been a way...

So, did you find
what you were looking for?

(birds chirping)

Hello?

Hello?


Anyone home?






(trash can lid thuds)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(breathing deeply)

â™ª â™ª

(car approaching)

â™ª â™ª

All right.

All right, yeah, I just...
I gotta get something to drink.

It's really hot out, okay.

All right, take care.

â™ª â™ª

(glass clinking)

I ran.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


(exhaling heavily)

â™ª â™ª

But I had to meet him.

â™ª â™ª

Hey!

Hey, you!

â™ª â™ª

I didn't want to run away

from the only chance
I might have.

â™ª â™ª

I needed to get back in there.

â™ª â™ª

(heavy breathing)

â™ª â™ª

Excuse me, sir,
is this your house?

Yeah.

â™ª â™ª

Are you Cal Owens?

â™ª â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª â™ª

I think I know why you're here,

It must've been
pretty damn urgent, huh?

Mind telling me more?

It is.

It should have been fixed
earlier.

â™ª â™ª

I'm running out of time.

I need to be direct
with you, sir.

I need your help.

Okay, keep going.

The bullet that
I've heard stories about,

I'm coming to find out
that it's true.

And I know that you have it.

And I need you to help
my daughter.

Daughter?

So this is about
your daughter?

You know what,
do you mind sharing with me

what your name is?

Samantha Grey.

Okay, Ms. Grey,
what is it that you do?

I train dogs.

Dogs, what kind of dogs?

For what purpose?

For the blind,

for anyone
that needs assistance.

And what is it
that you like about it?

What do mean, what...

Look, I don't mean
to offend you.

Consider this my way of trying
to get to know you better.

This seems irrelevant.

If you want to get to know me...

I do want to know you.

That's why I'm here,
asking you these questions.

So, let me ask you,

when you're training your dogs,

what is it about the dog

that makes you want
to send it back to its owner?

I'm sorry.

But my work is
of no interest to you,

I don't see what this
has to do with anything.

If you say so,

then I guess so.

â™ª â™ª

But I'm afraid to tell you,

I'm sorry.

It came to us,

either as a blessing
or a curse.

â™ª â™ª

Please don't say no to me.

I need this.

I need this.

Please don't say no to me.
Please stop.

Please!
Stop.

I can't.
I will do anything.

I will do anything!

Please give it to me, please.

Ms. Grey.

Please.

I've only got one bullet left.

â™ª â™ª

I know as a doctor
it's my job to help people,

to help people
who are suffering.

But you and I both know
there's plenty of people...

Why can't you
just use it on me?

Why can't you
just give it to me?

I need it.

I need it for my girl,

for my daughter, please.

Please.

You're not sure I deserved it?

Is that why you were asking me
all those questions,

see if I really deserved it?

Who gave you the right
to fucking play God?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Doctor,
I'm sorry, sir.

You... you asked me
about my dogs.

You know how I pick them?

We pick the dogs,
we train them,

we... we put them
through a series of tests.

It's all about sacrifice
for them.

They don't get to choose
what their assignment is,

and yet they learn to love
unconditionally.

I would've sacrificed
everything for my daughter.

Everything.

And I am here today

to sacrifice everything,

so go ahead and judge me.

â™ª â™ª

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

Let's go see her.

She's okay.

â™ª â™ª

I couldn't help it.

Something was...

eating at me.

I needed to get back in there.

â™ª â™ª

He's a doctor,
so luckily I knew

he wouldn't be home
during the day.

â™ª â™ª

As I'd hoped,

no one answered.

â™ª â™ª

I don't know why
I grabbed the door,

I'm not a thief or a criminal.

â™ª â™ª

The door was unlocked again.

â™ª â™ª

At first I was relieved,

so I thought no one was there.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

How is she?

Is she okay?

â™ª â™ª

She's okay.

I did exactly like you asked,
gave her my full attention.

Can I see her?

Yes.

But if we're gonna
do this, Barry,

you should trust me.

It's better to wait.

How are things going
on your end?

Thanks for everything, Cal.

Everything went just fine.

At least I think so.

How about you?

Come to any resolution?

Yeah, that's what
we need to decide.

â™ª â™ª

I went to her house.

â™ª â™ª

You should've let it go.

Don't you think she's going
to go there again?

Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about that,

she's too afraid
to do something there.

â™ª â™ª

There was nothing.

â™ª â™ª

The book was gone.

And where was the book?

Sounds to me you're unsure
about giving people chances.

â™ª â™ª

No.

No, it's not that.

â™ª â™ª

You just want people
to be unhappy.

No, I just think that

even the hardest things
to accept...

â™ª â™ª

...they're meant to be, too.

I was being led.

For every step I took,

I realized I was always
a few steps behind.

â™ª â™ª

Why do you exist?

I don't know.

It wasn't up to me
to be the one.

â™ª â™ª

Maybe I'm just here
because people like you need me.

â™ª â™ª

Are you sure you want
to do this?

â™ª â™ª

Yes.

â™ª â™ª

Yes.

â™ª â™ª

Yes.

â™ª â™ª

I was visited
by some unwanted company.

â™ª â™ª

Who, the old man?

Yes, he was there.

By himself?

â™ª â™ª

With the doctor.

â™ª â™ª

(bell chiming)

â™ª â™ª

What?

â™ª â™ª

What is this?

â™ª â™ª

No dog?

Placed in a home.

â™ª â™ª

Ms. Grey, come.

â™ª â™ª

Have a seat.

Let's have a chat.

â™ª â™ª

Please stop.

â™ª â™ª

She's been through enough
already.

â™ª â™ª

How many times?

â™ª â™ª

Hey, what is this?

â™ª â™ª

Found this inside the drawer.
So what?

What does that mean?

â™ª â™ª

You know you, asked me
to judge you, Ms. Grey.

Maybe this is the result
of all the negativity

that you've stirred up.

â™ª â™ª

Did it make you feel better

reading this
while you were so angry?

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

You know it's hard
to forgive someone

when you're held up
with so much contempt.

You're all stirred up
with your emotions aren't you?

â™ª â™ª

Did you say something
over there?

He has nothing to do with this.

He's paid his dues.

â™ª â™ª

What is that?

This isn't gonna work.

â™ª â™ª

Don't you think she's been
through enough already?

What do you mean?

What are you doing?

Don't you think this woman
has been through enough?

She's been through enough
already.

After all this time,

you decide to get involved now?

She's already lost everything,
she's lost her daughter.

Don't you think that's enough?

This is not our place.

What do you think she's done?

Oh, you mean besides
committing a crime?

That's not what I meant.

Listen, we are not one of them.

Let's not try
to protect her, okay?


I'll kill you!

â™ª â™ª

This is...

It was a letter.

I know that.

Why don't you want
to help them?

I'm very sorry for the choices
that I've made.

â™ª â™ª

This is not our place.

â™ª â™ª

And don't present yourself
as an equal.

â™ª â™ª

I know who you are.

â™ª â™ª

Who am I?

â™ª â™ª

You would think
they're equal, wouldn't you?

But tell me this:

Why do they need
to hurt each other?

You didn't know, did you?

It wasn't just one letter
that he made out.

He wanted me to protect
and provide closure

for his wife
after his untimely death.

Dead men don't tell tales.

â™ª â™ª

Because they have me.

I was being condemned.

And what makes you so special?

â™ª â™ª

Like I did something wrong.

I'm sorry, Anessa.

â™ª â™ª

You may think
we are similar in every way.

â™ª â™ª

But you couldn't be
further from the truth.

â™ª â™ª

This little fact

makes me of greater value
than you.

â™ª â™ª

I had to know exactly
what I was dealing with.

â™ª â™ª

It was the truth.

â™ª â™ª

He didn't kill himself.

I bring people back.

â™ª â™ª

You only kill them.

â™ª â™ª

You killed him.

â™ª â™ª

You're practically...

â™ª â™ª

a murderer.

â™ª â™ª

He's a murderer.

He killed my daughter.

There are two sides
to every story, Ms. Grey.

I suggest you start
telling yours now.

What did you do?

â™ª â™ª

Please!

â™ª â™ª

Mom!

Please just answer me!

Did you kill him?

Please answer me,
how could you do this?

â™ª â™ª

Why would you do this?

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Please just answer me, Mom,

what did you do?

If I tell you,
will you help me?

â™ª â™ª

Fine.

â™ª â™ª

We'll burn the letter.

â™ª â™ª

Please answer me.

â™ª â™ª

What did you do?

â™ª â™ª

I did it.

â™ª â™ª

I killed him.

â™ª â™ª

No.

No, I didn't kill him.

â™ª â™ª

No.

(wind blowing)

(fire crackling)

Shoot me.

Sam, what do you mean,
shoot you?

Oh, my God.

(gasping and coughing)

I don't suppose you'd begrudge
Mr. Syput for all this.

After all, he came to me
the other night,

and after all the time
I've known him,

I've never seen him be put off

as much as he was that night.

He didn't tell me anything
about you two,

and I would have never
figured it out.

Except when he came to me
the other night,

he told me that he wanted
to take his own life,

that he didn't want
to go on living anymore,

and I thought that was quite odd
for a man of his age.

And more so,
why would he abandon his wife

and leave her behind
with no benefits

after he passed?

Ms. Grey,
he was looking for help.

And I was there
to help this man.

â™ª â™ª

Please shoot me.

I'm offering my life to you.

I just want it over.

I want to die.

â™ª â™ª

Why? I don't understand.

â™ª â™ª

Oh, you don't understand
what I've done for it.

â™ª â™ª

For what?

The bullet.

â™ª â™ª

(car engine starting)

â™ª â™ª

You may have wanted
to be someone's angel,

just to save lives,

but taking lives
is just as important.

â™ª â™ª

I never blamed you,

because I had my doubts.

â™ª â™ª

Dash, on the other hand,

he didn't think
it would be wise

to use the bullet on someone

who's claiming to kill himself.

No!

Nooo!

Please don't do this!

â™ª â™ª

But I knew otherwise.

â™ª â™ª

This man was innocent.

â™ª â™ª

And I decided
to use everything on him.

â™ª â™ª

(indistinct radio chatter)

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry to say, Ms. Grey.

â™ª â™ª

I don't have
what you're looking for.

â™ª â™ª

The last bullet...

...the last one...

was used on him.

â™ª â™ª

Excuse me, excuse me.
Yes?

Who are you?
I'm Dr. Owens.

This is my house.

â™ª â™ª

Jesus, I don't even know
want to say.

â™ª â™ª

I watched her suffer.

I didn't even help her.

I watched her seize, and...


â™ª â™ª

What did you do?

The woman.

â™ª â™ª

What woman?

Who, where?

â™ª â™ª

At the doctor's.

â™ª â™ª

I went to get the bullet.

â™ª â™ª

I knew my way around.
Who was it?

â™ª â™ª

She was blind.

â™ª â™ª

She was old.

â™ª â™ª

What did you do?

I'm not a criminal.

â™ª â™ª

I just went in there
to get the bullet.

â™ª â™ª

I just had to get the bullet.

â™ª â™ª

My Lillian...

â™ª â™ª

My Lillian's so mad at me.

â™ª â™ª

More than that old woman.

Sir?

â™ª â™ª

Sir.

What is this?

Are you Dr. Owens?
Yes.

Do you know her?

She called us.

She said she needs
to talk to you.

â™ª â™ª

I had to see if it would work.

â™ª â™ª

I had to know
if I could trust her.

â™ª â™ª

Mr. Syput?

Mr. Syput?

â™ª â™ª

So you can save my wife.

Why can't you just
do this for me?

â™ª â™ª

Wait, wait, wait.

Mr. Syput?

You can't let her do this!

The old lady...
Don't you understand?

...you saw her?

Stop her!

Don't let her do this!

â™ª â™ª

Talk to me, look at me.

Look at me.

â™ª â™ª

Talk to me.
Stop her.

Answer me.
Don't let her do this!

You saw the old woman,
the blind woman?

Who was she?

Who was she?
Don't you understand?

Don't let her do this!
Tell me!

â™ª â™ª

This gun took away everything
important to me in my life.

There is nothing left
for me here.

I shot you once in revenge.

â™ª â™ª

You owe this to me.
You don't have to do this!

There's another world out there.

â™ª â™ª

Please don't,
you're gonna regret this.

There's a whole world out there.

She's talking to me.

â™ª â™ª

I can hear her.

Please, you don't have
to do this.

â™ª â™ª

You don't have to do this.

There's a whole world out there.

This has nothing
to do with you.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(engine starts)

â™ª â™ª


Don't, please stop.

Sam, Sam, listen.

Sam, Sam, look at me.

Sam.

Sam, look at me!

â™ª â™ª

Don't do this, Sam.

Please don't do this.

Sam, Sam, please, look at me!

â™ª â™ª

Keep watching people die
at my expense.

â™ª â™ª

I've been waiting so long
to ask you this.

â™ª â™ª

Will you forgive me?

â™ª â™ª

Death comes whenever it wants.

I will decide where and when
I lay my head to rest.

I won't let you rest
until you tell me what you saw!

â™ª â™ª

The trigger is with me.

â™ª â™ª

The woman, you saw her.

You saw her dying?

Tell me!
I don't want it anymore.

Tell me.

Who was she?
I don't know...

You know who she was.

Tell me, I gotta know!

You gotta tell me!

â™ª â™ª

Please, tell me you didn't.

â™ª â™ª

Please.

(gun cocking)

Everything is gonna
be fine, Barry.

Everything is gonna be fine.

â™ª â™ª

Sam.

Sam, listen.

Listen to me.

Sam.

Sam, listen to me.

Look at me, Sam.

Sam, look at me!

Sammy, don't do this.

Please, Sam, don't do this.

Sam, please!

Sam, look at me, don't do this!

Please, Sam, don't do this!

Sam, please,
don't do this, please!

Nooo!
