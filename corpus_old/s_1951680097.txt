Well?

<i> I am sending you the code. </i>

Yes I see that, thank you.

What about my account?
Delivering.

<i> I have just sent it,
you should have it. </i>

Yes, thank you.

<i> Are you sure that this is legal? </i>

<i> we are just running a test on our
security systems, Sir, </i>

<i> it is fine. </i>

<i> you have a sexy voice. Err, is
there anything else we can do for you? </i>

To you?
We have a winner.

Ready.

Yo, guess who just made 50,000 today.

What did you do to my drive, man?
Man, shut up I didn't touch it.

Man, don't ever touch my computer.

The diagnostics show no damage but we are
certain that it was an intentional breech.

Are you saying we were hacked?

It wasn't a denial of service level.

They definitely cracked our door.

OK. Open the "Black Eye" files.

I want every hacker in the country,

who could have done this,
interviewed, now.

Sir, that is close to a thousand names.

With the holiday weekend, we are
short staffed as it is.

Listen...

We are meant to stop this happening
and it just did.

Just get it done.

Sir, it is the middle of the night and
they are scattered over the whole country.

Fine, get local enforcement help.

Somebody thinks they can screw with us.
I want to find out who.

Dennis, I said no.

Lucy, you're killing me, alright?

Get out of the car.
What?

Out of the car, now!
Don't touch me.

No means no jerk-off.
What are you doing?

John, stop it!
Don't call me that.

I hate it when you call me that.

Do you know this guy?
Shut up, shut your mouth.

Dad!

Stop it I mean it!

Dad? You said your dad was dead.

What?

You told this jerk-off I was dead?

You actually said that?
I may have exaggerated a little.

And is this guy your boyfriend?

No!
Yes!

I don't know.

We will see.

What are you doing here?

You don't answer your phone,
you don't return my calls.

That is because I am not
talking to you.

Why aren't you talking to me
this time, Lucy?

why not?

You want a list?

How about stuff like this:
you spy on me!

Do I spy on you?

You come over here and
drag my boyfriend of the car...

You said that he is not your boyfriend.
He is not!

But you said that I was...
God! Just...

You are such an asshole.

OK

I am sorry for pulling your
not boyfriend out of the car.

OK?

Let's just get in the car.

No!

Wont both of you just go away?
Talk to me, Lucy.

I am tired and I am going for bed.
Alone.

You are damn right alone.

Lucy, wait one minute.

I want to talk to you.
Wait.

Dad.

When I want to talk to you.

If I want to talk to you.

I'll call you.

Lucy!

Wait, Lucy! Lucy!

Lucy McClane!
It is not McClane, it is Gennero.

Chicks, right?

I'm gonna go.

I'll go.

<i> John! </i>

<i> John! </i>

<i> it is Sclavino. </i>

This is McClane.

What are you doing at Rutgers?
How does you know where I am?

We had all the cars tracked
4 years ago, you remember.

I am looking exactly
at where you are.

So that's not something that I
would turn on.

Yes, we did that, John.

We turned them on.

Listen...

The feds have called in a favour.

<i> they are doing a sweep. </i>

They want us to pick up a
a computer hacker in Camden.

The last name is Farrell.

<i> THE first name is Mathew. </i>

Camden?

<i> What are you telling me for? </i>

<i> It's 3 in the morning.
I’m on my way home. </i>

Send a jug-head from the Academy.
They will be happy to go pick this kid up.

I can't just send
any one in uniform.

<i> The feds demanded
a senior detective. </i>

<i> The kid is a high value subject. </i>

<i> I don't know.
Just pick him up. </i>

Escort him to the
Hoover building in Washington.

They had some kind of
computer breech there this morning.

Right.

Give me the information.

Give me that name again
What is it?

You owe me one, Jack.

God damn it.

Plan B,
We do it ourselves

Who is it?
NYPD.

Open the door, please.

Hi.
NYPD?

Yeah.
I get it.

Don't worry, everyone gets lost
round here, happy to help

Son, I am not lost.

Are you Matt Farrell?
Mathew Farrell?

No...

Actually, he doesn't live here.

Of course not.
Who are you?

My name is Daisy Duke.

I got a lot of shit for
it when I was a kid.

Please, don't add to it.

Can I see some identification, please?

Yeah, sure.

Detective!
Yeah that looks real.

Where did you get that?
Toys R Us?

It looks great.

That...

That actually looks pretty good.

Farrell!

Soldier just pdld a new copy of the killzone.
Do you want to come to take a look?

No, thanks though man!

And good luck at the bad timing awards.

Open the door.

Shit!

What's this about?
I don't know.

Some kind of computer thing.

The DC Feds
wanna talk to you.

So, let's go.

Feds, huh?
Yeah, the Feds.

I've been watched for four years.

Once you are on that
god damn list. Pain in the ass.

Do you play with dolls?

Err, could you please
not touch that.

Is it like a G.I.Joe?
No, it is not!

It is a limited edition of...

Is that meant to come off?
No, it is not.

But it is much more valuable broken.
So thanks for that.

Crazy glue, I'm sure it's
very important.

I have other cool shit in
here if you want to break that.

Let's go, OK? Come on!

I need to power down
my gear, ok?

More dolls.

You don't spend a whole load of
time with the girls, huh?

Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

Please! Don't shoot.

Don't shoot.
Get down!

Keep your head down.

Let's go, come on.
Stay down.

Come on.

Is everything OK?
No.

Stay down.

You stay with me.
OK.

Follow me.
OK.

Right.

That's gonna wake the neighbours.

Get down, get inside.
Get down!

They are back in the room!

<i> They are back in the room! </i>

Are you nuts?

Get out of there right now!
I am trying...

Now!

Go to the right.

Let's go!

Get back in there!

Get ready to run.

Ready?

What the hell was that?

What?

Did you do that?

No.

Shit.

I didn't do that.

Let's go.
Shit.

Stay close to me.

OK.

Let's go.

Come on, let's go damn it!

Let's go.

Let's go!

Watch it.
Just tone it down.

OK.

Let's go!

Stay close.

Stay with me.

Stay with me.
Right!

Let's go.
Stay close.

Get in the car.

Go, go.
Yes.

Kid, can you reload a gun?
What? Me?

Can you reload a gun?
Oh, yeah...

Look in the glove box and get a
magazine out right now!

Get your head down.

Is the circus in town?

Did you see that?
I saw it. I did it.

Camden Base 10077,
come back.

Camden Base 10077.

<i> Camden Base go ahead. </i>

I need to speak with your chief,
this is a police emergency.

ASAP.

<i> Standby. </i>

<i> This is chief detective Wiesman. </i>

Detective this is Detective John McClane
of the NYPD.

Police Emergency.

I want to report a police
shooting in your jurisdiction.

<i> Tell him yourself. </i>

Yes.

What's the status?

<i> We lost him. </i>

<i> Three of our men are dead. </i>

Hold the line.

Thomas.

We have a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell is still alive.

So he got away?
Yes.

I did send 5 of you, right?
Yes, but he was not alone.

I am sending the chopper, get airborne.
We will track him down.

<i> Think you can handle that? </i>

Oh my God!

Just breathe.
I am breathing, but...

I can't stop shaking.
It is the adrenaline.

You are just scared.
It will pass.

Of course I'm scared.

Weren’t you scared, back there?

Yes.

I was scared.

Really?
This is you being scared?

I dunno, you seem really calm.

Have you done stuff like that before?

Stuff like what?

Like killing people.

Yes.

Not for a long time.

Who were those guys?

Why did they try to kill you?
Why did they blow up my apartment?

They were there to kill you.

Why would they want to kill me?

You tell me, kid.

You're the criminal.

We got 7 dead hackers so far,
none high on our list

Collect the hard drives
and start sweeping them..

Yes, Sir.

Trey...

Matthew Farrell,
Find him for me.

On it.

What's with all the guns?

Operational prudence.

Think of them as
hardware to your software.

<i> good morning D.C. </i>

<i> Well it' shaping up to be
another beautiful 4th of July weekend. </i>

<i> If you've got any big plans,
you better get started early. </i>

<i> Because it looks like the
traffic is hotting up. </i>

<i> So another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there. </i>

What?

What?

What?

What are you doing?
What is that?

It is Credence.

Credence?
Credence.

Credence Clearwater Revival.

Classic rock.
I know who it is.

It is  old rock,
that does not make it classic.

What sucked back then
still sucks now.

You don't like Credence?

It is like having a pine cone
shoved up my ass.

OK, really...

Wow how mature!

Come on man.

<i> We are at a heading of 060.
Making another pass. </i>

Listen up everyone.

Are we ready?

The transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

Begin stage 1.

When was the last time you tuned
in your radio to pop music?

Give me any decade.

Was it the seventies?

Did Michael Jackson still play?

Pearl Jam.
I'm going back about 10 years.

Ten years.

Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?

It's called News Radio.

I'm trying to see if any of your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

Hold on.

You listen to the news?
Yeah, you have a problem with the news now?

Yes, I have a big God damned
problem with the news.

Are you ready for this?

The news is completely manipulated.

Everything that you hear
every single day...

is designed by corporate media
to do one thing only.

Jesus!

To keep you living in fear.

Oh fear?
Total fear.

Fear so you will go out and
spend money on things.

Things you probably don't even need.
Things you should already be sick of.

So that their advertisers keep
buying adds on their stations.

And I tell one more thing.
Are you ready for this?

I can do this all day man.
I've got days of data at home.

I'll drop a bomb on you bigger......

HEY!
SHUT UP!

That's good, that's good,
be dismissive

You...

Are you OK?
No, I am not OK.

Stay in the car.
You will be OK.

Hey man! Hey.

How are you doing,
you alright?

Just call 911, alright?

Jesus Christ.

All of the lights are green.

All of the lights are green.

Let's go, right now.

We gotta go?
Let's go.

Get your bag hack boy.
Let's go.

Jesus.
Let's go.

I've never been in a crash.
Are you alright?

Well it is very exciting.
This way, here we go.

Have you ever been in a car accident?
Yes, I have been in a car accident.

What are we doing?

A little thing they invented back
in the 60s, it's called jogging.

Sir, Chicago is reporting a system crash
in their train network

Amtrak is flashing a level 1
crash of their system

F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC Net just went down.

We are under attack.

OK.

Let's get them outside
for a little bit of fresh air.

That is the Anthrax Alarm.

Alright, everyone out,
Now!

Now!

Taylor, move, go.

Move!

<i> All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately. </i>

<i> This is not a drill. </i>

<i> All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately. </i>

Take the team and go for
the fourth floor. Got it?

Masks on.

Make it happen, OK?

Research the data
from these crashes,

see if you can ID the
point of origin.

Begin Stage 2.

<i> Hey what is going on? </i>

<i> What is happening? </i>

They are already starting
to panic.

Of course they are.

They think that someone
is taking their money.

All of those nickel
and dimes they saved.

Useful idiots,
as Lyman would say.

Prep the video package.

DC transportation system is crashing

And they just hit the financial
sector. Everything.

Call the Secretary of Trans, the
Treasury And the Director of F.C.C.

Let's go people!

Somebody, somewhere,
has left a digital fingerprint.

Find it!

Is Deputy Director Bowman
in here?

Not now it will have to wait.
Not today waxworks.

This is Matthew Farrell.

I brought him here on direct
orders from Bowman.

So if you don't know what's going on,
find me somebody who does.

I am Bowman.

The video package is
ready for upload.

Thanks.

Listen, John.

I thank for bringing Farrell,
but everything’s changed this morning

We are neck deep in
damage control right now.

'Scuse me, I'm sorry, Sir.

Do you have something to eat?
Any snacks around here?

I would love... I am
really low on blood sugar.

Sir?

No?

<i> As if the crash of the traffic
system wasn't bad enough. </i>

<i> the Stock exchange was
in a selling frenzy this afternoon. </i>

<i> the Commission believes this panic
may have been caused by computer malfunction. </i>

<i> it is Believed to be related... </i>

It's not as bad as it looks.

We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

Are these your suspects?
They were.

All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

Do you recognize any of them?

No.

Not one??

Sir.

You need to see something here.

<i> My fellow Americans... </i>

<i> it is time...
to strike... </i>

<i> the citizenry. </i>

<i> Thank you. </i>

<I> And a...
Happy... 

Independence Day...
for everyone!

That was creepy.

I tried to find more Nixon.

Do you think they bought it?

Absolutely.

OK.

I want telecommunications, transports and...

Jesus Christ! It's a Fire Sale.

What?

It's a Fire Sale.

Hey, we don't know that yet.

It is a myth anyway.
It cannot be done.

Oh it's a myth?
Really?

Please tell me she's only here for show
and she's not actually in charge of anything.

What is a Fire Sale?
It is a three step....

It is a three step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

ok Step 1 : Take out all
the transportation

Step 2 : The financial base and telecoms

Step 3 : Get rid of all the utilities.
Gas, Water, Electricity, Nuclear....

Basically everything that is
controlled by a computer.

Which nowadays is almost everything.

So that's why they call it a Fire Sale
because everything must go.

Hey, listen,
what's your name?

Farrell?
Keep your voice down OK?

Nobody here is talking about a Fire Sale.

Not unless you are telling me
you helped plan one.

No man, I'm just saying...

We appreciate the concern, we
know what we are doing, thank you.

What?

What?
Nothing, I said I understand.

Hey, they didn't send the
girl scouts to get this kid.

They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear,

they blew the whole joint up.

Now look, I don't know this kid...

and, frankly, I don't give a shit.
No offence.

But somebody wants this kid dead.

And obviously, it's got something
to do with what's going on here.

Humler is taking over
the interrogations,

of the hackers that we are bringing in.

I will get you an escort over there.

Right? Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

I want to know what he knows.
Right.

If he knew about half of what I know,
his fuzzy little head would explode.

Special agent Johnson.
I will take you there.

Agent Johnson?
That's right.

Right this way.

So is any of what you were saying possible?
Possible?

OK look, I will tell you again.
If you take away any one thing, no problem,

but if you take it down all at once,
the system crashes, and...

look around, man!

Come on, the government has got to have
dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.

It took FEMA 5 days to get
water to the superdome.

How long until we get to
the Dept. of Homeland Security?

Lauflin, get on the police band and get
them to clear a route to the D.H.S.

DC Metro, this is the
F.B.I., requesting you to...

Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

The feds are taking him to Homeland.

Good, close that loop now.

Isolate the frequency.

Locate the vehicles and get
me John McClane's file.

<i > Brad, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for location.

I don't mean to harp guys but

but have just passed another
snack bar and I am starving.

Shut up.
I need to eat.

Shut up.

Shut up. You have 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

Did I lie to you?
What are you talking about?

The pictures on the wall.
You knew those guys, right?

I, wha..., I ...
Kid, don't lie to me.

I am a cop, I can tell you are
lying. Who are they?

OK, OK OK...

They were my competition.

Make the next right onto Concord.

They said they were a software firm
that had developed some kind of

a new algorithm

and they just wanted to see
if it could be cracked.

That's what I do,
I do math based security.

Here's the thing,

the thing that I've been thinking is
that if you can do something this massive

you need tons of start-up guys
to write the software

but only a few black hats

to actually implement that stuff

so then the start-up guys
who haven't really done anything

like me...
-End up as pictures on a wall

I swear to God McClane
I had no idea I was gonna be

an accessory to Armageddon

<i> Take the next left at Lexington. </i>

and that's a sexy voice.

What is she taking us this way for?

Oh, my God!

<i> Unit this is dispatch 
 clear a route for two F.B.I. vehicles... </i>

<i> F.B.I. we have cleared a path. </i>

That's her!
Her who?

What are you talking about?

It is them.

Are you saying it's "them" them?
I swear to you, I know her.

I would know her voice anywhere.

Don't say anything.
Keep you mouth shut for a second.

Hey Metro,
how's your day going over there?

Gotta be crazy over there
with all these 5-87s, huh?

Yes, Sir, we had to
dispatch all units.

Yeah you had to dispatch all units,

for all the naked people walking around?

Cut the bullshit honey
and just put your boss on.

<i> Lauflin, we are getting off this route
make a left here on 14th street.. </i>

Officer McClane.
That is Detective McClane, asshole.

Don't worry though, we will have
plenty of time to get to know each other...

when I come visit you in prison.

But, John, I already know
so much about you.

Your address in Brooklyn...

the payments on your mortgage,
how long you have been in the NYPD

and how is Holly?
That's sad, you are divorced.

Was that tough on little
Jack and Lucy?

After thirty years, I would have thought
you had a better pension plan.

Oh and it gets worse...

Your 401k no longer exists

Tell you what, let me
make it up to you.

-Box them in at that intersection.

Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,
and drive away

by the time you get to the end
of the next block,

all your debts will
be wiped clean...

and your children
will be set for life.

That really is tempting,
especially that last part.

But I think I'll pass, Jerk off.

John, you are a Timex
watch in a digital age.

You are gonna lose.

Yes, well the other thing that can
happen, it is that I can come and find you...

kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

What do you think about that dickhead?
Hold your position.

He is not responding.

Down, get down!

Officers down at the corner
of Main with Constitution.

I repeat, officers down.

Come on, come on,
get out let's go!

God Damn It!

Stay down!

Get down, just hold on!

We have a squad car under fire
we need backup.

<i> I Repeat, we need backup! </i>

This is base, we are
sending backup.

Hang on, hang on.

Hang on.

Hold on.

We lost ....
Stay with them.

OK take the tunnel, left left left!

Give me the schematics
of that tunnel.

The tunnel!

Open the gates on the North side entrance.

Redirect traffic,
occupy all lanes.

Open the other side.
What?

Move!

Hang on to something!

Hey, don't get out of the car!
Hey!

Stop!

Run!

Oh God!

Don't ever hesitate
like that again.

Are you alright?

Stay here, don't move.
What?

You've been here before John.

Get over to the wall, Sir.

The feds called in a favour.

All you gotta do is pick
up a kid in Jersey...

drive him down to DC.

How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard can it?

No, gotta be a senior detective

think that a traffic jam

or throwing a car at me
Will stop me, huh?

Red, get in there and get it done.
It won't be necessary, he is leaving.

This is not a good idea!

Don't touch me!
OK OK alright...

Are you OK? Oh my God!

Pretty lucky shot, huh?
Oh yeah lucky!

Jesus, you just killed a
helicopter with a car.

I was out of bullets.

How you doin'?

I skinned my knee and my
asthma is acting up....

Whatever, yeah I'm fine.

<i> Red, check in. </i>

<i> The helicopter is destroyed. </i>

What about Farrell and McClane?

They are both dead.
Come back in.

OK we are moving on,
begin Stage 3.

I have just spoken to Emmerson.

The teams are arriving
at Woodlawn now.

Very good.

Mai, get ready for the downloads.

Identification, Sir.

Park behind the transpo
and we will guide you in.

Man the gate, you come with me.

The anthrax alarms only went off
across five floors.

Below that you will
need clearance.

I don't know why you would
need to go down there

there is nothing down there
but servers.

<i> All clear. Rodriguez! </i>

<i> Incoming. </i>

The gate is secured.
Copy.

OK, we are in.

Hey, this is absurd
there is tough and there is stupid.

You need a hospital,
look at you.

I am not a doctor, but
you look like you are hurt.

Yes, sexy, right?
No.

Come on.

We don't need a doctor,
we need the cops.

He's in.

Get out of the way,
look out, please.

NYPD, alright, I got this kid.
Come on let's go.

NYPD

Sergeant?

Sergeant!

I need to speak with you.

The doctor is in the back.

I am NYPD,
I need to talk to you.

Just give me a minute.

Oh my God!

Let's get of here.

<i> Perfect! Now the second sequence. </i>

<i> The server is ready. </i>

We are go.

Launch the downloads.

Nothing is happening.

Be patient.

I don't know, it's not responding.
Wait for it.

See.

There you go.

Let me know when the
download reaches 20%.

OK.

Excuse me!
Thank you!

Holy Shit!

Kid? Kid? Hey!

You got a phone in that bag?
Yes.

Come on let's go.

and here you go, agent...
Tavarek. I guess that's you.

The download is at 20%.

Time to move. Let's keep them
chasing their tails.

Due to the recent activity...

law enforcement agencies are
being extremely cautious.

They are telling people to abandon
vehicles, until they are searched.

And as you can see...

K-9 units are
checking each vehicle.

Now whether this is connected
to the anthrax reports earlier...

or if it is a new  terrorist threat
we don't know that this stage.

FAA just grounded all flights.

Good.
Sir...

We have complete access
over system networks.

Phones, power grids,
water, nuclear....

Hey, excuse me...
Dan Parry, The NSA

Chuck Summer DHS Liaison.
The White House made the call.

Anything you need,
We are here to help.

Help? Wow. that's, that's great.

We are gonna need some work space
for our people.

What can you do for us?

Well as you can see, we are
using the space...

you guys can stand in the corner,

and liaise.

and if I need something...

I'll just wake you.

Wait, no no. Don't call.
What?

What are you talking about?
They probably cracked that hours ago

if you use it they might
be able to trace us here.

Just put in your pocket.
Sure?

Yes.

Or smash it, you didn't have to smash it...

Excuse, me.
police Emergency.

He'll call you right back.

Here, wait in here.

Do you have a signal?
Yes.

Yes.

This is John McClane
for agent Bowman.

Sir, John McClane is on the line.

McClane, go.

We never made it to DHS

They came for the kid again.
All your men are down.

And what about Farrell?
Yeah he's here with me.

Sir?
Hang on, John.

Yeah I'll hold on.

Another day in paradise.

They just swamped everything,

the whole telecom system.
Phones, cellular, satellite...

They are blanketing every station.

Can you put the news back on?
This is the news.

It on every channel,
It's been like this for a few minutes now.

Oh my God!

Shit!

McClane!

Look out!

Look out!

Bowman? Do you see that?

McClane?
Bowman?

It's a fake.

I see it.

Thank God!

McClane?
Bowman.

The satellite's down.
Get me a landline.

One little piece of code
and the world falls apart.

This is virtual terrorism.
What?

It's crazy, the first time that I
heard of a Fire Sale

I actually thought it would be cool,
if somebody did it.

Hit the "reset" button...

melt the system, just for fun.

Hey, it is not a system.

It is a country. We are
talking about people.

A whole country, full of people.

Sitting at home, alone...

scared to death in
their houses, alright.

So if you are done with
your little nostalgic moment...

maybe you can think a little
and help me catch these guys.

Just help me.

Just put yourself in their shoes.

Come on.

if this were your Fire Sale,
what would be your next move?

OK, the point of a Fire Sale is that it
is mostly done by remote, right...

But not everything is run
completely on-line.

Major utilities aren't,
they are run in closed circuits...

you can breech the security
up to a certain point, but...

to shut it down you would have
to physically go there...

You know what, give me that guys PDA.

The phones don't work,
they are all dead.

No the phones are fine
it is the network that is dead.

I only need to reprogram it...

and link it into the old sat-coms,
hackers surf them the whole time.

It is probably what these guys are
using to talk to each other.

How do you know all this stuff?

Dude, I don't know.

I couldn't explain it to you.

OK.

The national power grid,
gas and the electricity...

they are divided in to
three zones, right?

Eastern, Central and Western.
Each one with a primary hub.

Here it is.

What is that, what am I looking at?
That is the eastern hub.

Now, they take this out...

It wipes out all the power
for the entire eastern corridor.

But again they will have to
do it manually.

OK.

Come on, let's go.
What, to West Virgínia?

I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me.

McClane, McClane?
Oh you get used to it.

McClane. Oh, shit!

Sir, wireless networks are down
they are hitting the landlines too.

I don't care how,
you find me a line.

Come on, what you got?

We swept the whole building,
It seems clean. We can...

sweep it again, but...
Don't bother.

Don't bother.

It is fake. These guys planned this...

Alright get everybody back
inside the crisis centre, now.

Let's open it up!

Come on, get in.

The door is locked. Unless
you have an extra gun to unlock it.

Hey, don't do that.

You're gonna disable it... Shit.

Wow, crazy, did you see that?

Sorry about that man.
I didn't know it would come out so fast.

How did you do yours?

Are you alright? What,
did it hit you a little bit.

Sorry.

Please, don't touch those, OK?
I know what am doing.

I have done this before.

I mean, I have read about it.

<i> Road Assist we have detected
an airbag deployment. </i>

Yes erm! Please, we hit a tree...

and my Dad is having
a heart attack...

I think he is gonna die.
You need to help us!

Hold while we contact
the Emergency Services.

No no no! He is dying!

Please, listen to me. I can take him
to the hospital, I can drive.

I am fine! But the key doesn't turn.

So you have to start the
car for us OK? Please, Dad...

Your name, please?

My name is...

Frank and my Dad's name is...

Dvorak Tsargentzki!

Please,  just help us! We need
your help, please!

The Emergency Services are on their way.

No no no! Listen, mam.

What is your name?
Dolores.

Dolores? OK, Dolores...

I don't know if you have a Dad...

but I do...

And I want to be able
to say that a year from now, OK?

Because my Dad is my
hero and right now he is...

in my arms, dying and...

and his only hope is...

to get to a hospital right now!
We can't wait!

So, please!
Start the God damn car!

Thank you, Dolores.

Pass the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

The what?
Warlock, he is a digital jedi.

Mam you are not authorised
to be here.

F.B.I. We suspect there has
been a security breech.

You have landed without authorisation.

That was pretty good back there, kid.
Thanks.

What’s the matter, nothing to complain about?
No, just.......

What? What's the problem?
I'm not like you,
