1700 NAUTICAL MILES FROM
THE SUMATRA STRAIGHTS

ALL IS LOST

Subtitles by Bambula

13th of July, 4:50 pm.

I’m sorry...

I know that means
little at this point,

but I am.

I tried,

I think you would all
agree that I tried.

To be true,

to be strong,

to be kind, to love,

to be right.

But I wasn’t.

And I know you knew this.
In each of your ways.

And I am sorry.

All is lost here...

except for soul and body...
that is, what’s left of them.

And a halfday’s ration.

It’s inexcusable
really, I know that now.

How it could have taken this long to
admit that I’m not sure...

but it did.

I fought ‘til the end,

I’m not sure what that is worth,

but know that I did.

I have always hoped
for more for you all...

I will miss you.

I’m sorry.

You! Here! There!
