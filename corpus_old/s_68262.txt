Hitler goes to
a fortuneteller and asks:

"When will I die?"

And the fortuneteller replies:

"On a Jewish holiday. "

Hitler then asks,
"How do you know that?"

And she replies:

"Any day you die
will be a Jewish holiday. "

So you ask me, as a Jew:

"How could you tell a joke like that
at a time like that?"

That's how we survived.

Those were some of the things
that kept us going.

Everything else,
the Germans had taken.

They built high walls with
barbed wire to shut us in the ghetto.

We were isolated from the rest
of the world for years without news.

So we relied on the little things:

A dark joke.

A sunny day.

A hopeful rumour.

That's why we'd go
and sit by the ghetto wall...

...and look at the tree
where I first kissed Hannah.

And it was by that wall
that it all started.

With a single sheet of newspaper.

No! It's too dangerous!

Where can she go?

Run, liebele. Run!

Be safe. Go, go, go!

DarIing!

We'II see you soon!
We Iove you, Lina!

HaIt!

What are you doing there?
Trying to escape from the ghetto?

Name!

Jakob Heym.

Don't you know it's punishabIe
by death for a Jew...

...to be in the streets after curfew?

You're right.
Of course you're right.

One hundred percent correct.

I don't think
the siren went off yet.

A smart Jew! Go over there!

Present yourseIf
to the officer on duty...

...and teII him
you were out after 8!

But it's not 8.

Are you arguing?

Go!

This is the radio of
the German Armed Forces Network.

HeiI, HitIer!

We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.

During a hard-fought
defensive battle...

...heroic troops of the Fatherland,
under General von Hartung...

...succeeded in driving back
the Russian forces near Bezanika.

Bezanika is a very strategic point
of this sector.

We will now broadcast a message
from our Führer.

Bezanika.

The Russians are there,
onIy 400 kiIometres away.

My God!
They're in PoIand.

What are you doing here?

The sentry sent me to Your RoyaIness
for my proper punishment.

AIthough I hadn't heard the siren,
and with due respect...

...if his watch is right,
then your cIock is wrong.

But that is for you to decide.

Decide?

What?

My appropriate punishment.

Even though, I take the Iiberty
of repeating myseIf:

00.

00.
It's onIy three minutes to 8.

Two minutes to 8.

Then the gentIeman, the sentry,
was just making fun of me.

Just because there's a war...

...peopIe shouIdn't stop joking
with one another.

May I?

We Jews are partiaI to jokes too.

Do you Iive far from here?

Ten minutes, if I run.

Then hurry.

PIease may I have a pass?

Now what do I do, Hannah?
I'm Iocked outside.

Gotta keep going.

It's crazy, Hannah.

I may be the onIy Jew
for 400 kiIometres...

...trying to get
back into the ghetto.

To get across that distance,
you have to be a mouse.

Oh, God of the Jews!

Why didn't you make your peopIe
a race of mice?

What good does it do to be a man?

I'm going.

I go.

Not yet!

Wait for the searchIight to go by.

-Who are you?
-Lina Kronstein.

I'm 10 1I2. How oId are you?

Watch out!

What are you doing here, anyway?
Trying to escape?

Where? A Jew wouId not Iast
five minutes out there.

So you're going back in?

Yes.

May I come with you?

With me?

Why me?

Who eIse?

AII right.

Come on.

Oh, wait! Wait!

You're scared?

No. Terrified.

Come on! This way!

-Here.
-Thank you, IittIe mouse.

Hide! PoIice!

Here!

Bye-bye, IittIe girI.

Thanks for saving my Iife.

You'II have to excuse me.

I'm very tired. I'm going home.
You shouId do the same.

Maybe I'II take the tram.

Bye-bye.

AII right.

Where wouId you Iike to go?
Do you have money for your fare?

Come on.

You can't stay here.
You have to go home.

Where are your parents?

Come on!

Our apartment is much nicer.
We have a Iiving room.

WeII, when there were
10 peopIe crammed in here...

...I'II show you no Iiving room.

If you don't Iike it,
find another hoteI.

That's not a nice thing
to say to me.

Excuse me.

-Where do I sIeep?
-Upstairs.

Why not here?

Because some nosy neighbour
might see you and denounce me...

...and then the Germans wiII come.
Come on.

-Here, kitty, kitty.
-Leave the cat aIone.

-Don't you Iike cats?
-No. I prefer a rat.

I don't want to see you
pIaying with that cat.

I certainIy don't want to see you
catch it and eat it.

Any cat that Iets itseIf
get caught is sick.

AII right, but
what am I supposed to eat?

You don't have
any ration coupons for me.

That's true.

I'II burn that bridge
when I get to it.

Here we are.

Look.

There's heat from the chimney.

Here's a book about Africa. You read
this, you'II forget you're hungry.

Don't worry. I'm used to it.

Now, come on.

-What's wrong?
-I Iost my doII.

Sorry, I don't have any doIIs.

Why not?

WeII, me and my wife
didn't have any chiIdren.

Where is your wife?
Did they put her on a train?

No, they shot her!

Under a tree.

Don't ask me what kind of tree.
I didn't bother to ask.

Time for sIeep.

It's crazy, Hannah.

I manage to more or Iess
smuggIe myseIf through the war.

I even got out
of the Kommandantur aIive.

And now I'm supposed
to take care of a IittIe girI.

I know we wanted a chiId.

But you usuaIIy
have them as babies...

...and you get
a chance to know them.

That's true.

But what if the Germans find her?
I'm the one who'II have to pay.

If the Russians are that cIose...

...it's onIy a few days, right?

Bezanika

Germans are dying each day

Russians are on their way

-KowaIsky!
-We're cIosed. We're cIosed.

-Time to open!
-Leave me aIone. Go away!

What are you doing?

-You can't kiII yourseIf.
-You got a reason why not?

Yeah, I have a good one.

That's just between you and me.

Yesterday evening
something very funny happened.

ActuaIIy, not that funny.
You might not find it funny.

-It's where I caught this coId--
-Get to the point.

The point is, my friend, yesterday after
curfew, I was in the Kommandantur--

-Are you an informer?
-Are you out of your mind?

No Jew Ieaves the Kommandantur
aIive except informers.

Don't teII me Iies.
I'm desperate, not stupid.

Get out of here, pIease.
PIease Ieave me aIone.

Go ahead.

PeopIe wiII say KowaIsky
didn't keep his part of a bargain.

I'm entitIed to
daiIy shaves and haircuts.

In exchange, you can eat
aII the pancakes you want in my café.

You haven't made any for 3 years.

What can I do?
The Germans don't Iet potatoes in.

But your beard keeps growing.

That's not my fauIt.
A deaI's a deaI.

Oh, good.

What are you compIaining about?
You have a duII razor.

Sit down.

Barber with a duII razor
is Iike a bIind moyl.

No insuIts. Sit down, pIease.
Here we go.

Here. Enough.

Good. Enough!

Professor!

No, thank you.

Excuse me.
My respects, professor.

I caught a coId Iast night.
Do you have some medicaI advice?

A cigar
and brandy, taken in Monte CarIo.

Give me your hand, professor.

-You have a good night?
-Good night?

If three suicides baIanced by
one birth is a good night, then, yes.

SpIendid, wonderfuI night.

Line up two at a time!
Pick a partner!

-HerscheI, you need a partner?
-Yes, but not with cough.

Professor!

Two weak men
don't make a strong man.

You forgot me!

-I unIoad, you carry.
-What'II I get?

The pIeasure of my company.

I have to eat.

Do I have to feed you?

AII right.

You aII right?

Yes, thank you.

Mischa?

Where are you? Sneaking a cigarette?
Is that it?

Oh, my God!

Are you meshugge?
It's forbidden to do that!

It couId be you and me here one day.
ShouIdn't we do something?

The best thing to do is nothing!
I don't want to be shot!

What way wouId you prefer to die?

Go away.
Don't stand here.

I can't Iet you do something stupid!

Can you stop me?

I'm your manager.

You're not a very good one.

You're not a very good boxer.

-You want to try me?
-We're not the same weight cIass!

Guard!

The guard is coming.

You'II make a good-Iooking corpse.

I'II take one of those
bastards with me.

Don't!

The Russians are in Bezanika.

And I heard HitIer's appIying
to be chief rabbi in BerIin.

-It's the truth.
-Let go!

I heard it on the radio!

It's forbidden to taIk.
Go to work.

What are you Iaughing at?

Forgive me, but...

...I just heard good news.

Go, go!

You'II get shot.

-You have a radio?
-Who said that?

-You said that.
-No, I didn't.

-What have we been taIking about?
-Shut up!

You sneaky bastard!

You had a radio aII this time!
I can't beIieve it!

I have no radio. I just said that
to keep you from getting shot.

Nobody'd say that if he didn't.

Do you reaIize the penaIty
for having a radio is death?

I was Iying!

Lying?

If you had one and didn't
want anyone to know...

...the best way wouId be
to say you had one...

...because no one owning a radio
wouId be stupid enough to admit it.

They'd Ieave you aIone,
which means...

-What does it mean, Jakob?
-I don't know.

It means you've got a radio.

I don't have a radio.

I understand.

Go, go.

Don't worry, Jakob.
You can trust me.

I'II keep it under my hat.

You better.

Because if you don't...

...you better start the Kaddish now,
because I'm a dead man.

-Jakob!
-What?

I'm going to start training again.

TeII your new manager.

HeIIo, Anna! How are you?

Are you taking a trip somewhere?

I think it's too dangerous
for you if I stay...

...so I shouId go
with my parents after aII.

May I take your book?

You're not going anywhere
untiI you eat your supper.

Aren't you eating?

Eat, aIways eat. It's not good
to stuff yourseIf tiII bursting.

Mischa. Have you been
in another fight?

No, it's nothing.
I have very good news.

Good news? What good news?

HeIIo, Mrs. Frankfurter.

HeIIo, Mr.--

How are you today?

Mr. Frankfurter,
I have something to ask you.

I've aIready beaten you, Papa.

UntiI the Iast Iine has been spoken,
the curtain cannot come down.

Excuse me, Mr. Frankfurter--

You have something to ask me?

I'm prepared to heIp you with
the overcrowding in this apartment.

Before I forget...
For you.

Two rutabagas.

I know it's not much. It doesn't
seem a fair exchange for...

Mr. Frankfurter.

Mrs. Frankfurter.

I am here to ask for
the hand of your daughter.

Come with me for a minute.

You know where we are?

Trains are coming to take us
and you make matrimoniaI pIans?

We've Iearned to Iive without
firewood, potatoes, decent cIothing...

...without chiIdren, but no one
can Iive without a future.

We have a future.
The war's about to end.

Someday, but who'II see it?

We wiII!

Our war is nearIy over.
You can count the hours.

Don't do this to my famiIy!

Don't come here and fiII our heads
with faIse hope!

Do you know where Bezanika is?

Do I know where Bezanika is?

I pIayed King Lear there three times.
"As fIies to... "

"To wanton--"

"As fIies to wanton boys are we
to the gods. They kiII us for sport."

Bezanika's Iess than
400 kiIometres away.

So what do I care?

The Red Army is there tonight.
ProbabIy even cIoser by now.

StaIin toId you this news personaIIy?

In absoIute confidence,
just between you and me...

...and Rosa and Mrs. Frankfurter...

...and Avron and Judith, and...

Jakob Heym toId me.

Jakob Heym, the iIIustrious
pancake vendor.

If he said it, it must be true.

He's got a radio.

PIease, don't teII anyone.
It couId be dangerous for him.

And you never said anything about it.

You've been Iistening to a radio!

Don't worry, it has no pIug.

Now I'II reduce it to spIinters.

CIose the door.

We couIdn't Iisten to it
for a moment?

Excuse me.

What happens when the Gestapo finds
the pancake vendor has a radio?

They wiII search the ghetto.
What wiII they find? This radio.

I'II say that I never Iistened to it.
They'II shoot me anyway.

For an encore, they'II hang me in
the square, next to that idiot Heym!

Morning!

-Great morning, Jakob.
-Good to see you, good to see you.

So what's new?

Nothing much, you know.
Kvart's wife Ieft him.

Under the circumstances,
seems a bit pointIess.

That's too bad.

You know, women.
Since Adam.

You don't say.

Can you keep my hair from faIIing out?

How Iong have we been friends?

What does that have to do
with my hair?

Do you have that green stuff?

You come every day for a free shave
and never mentioned a radio.

What radio? I have radios
Iike I have potatoes.

-Everybody knows you got a radio.
-What do you mean, everybody knows?

It's traveIIing at Ieast as fast
as the news about Kvart's wife.

ReaIIy? So by the evening,
the Gestapo wiII know.

You stiII have that rope?
I may need it.

Mischa says the Russians kiIIed
so many Germans...

...their tanks crossed the river
on their bodies.

-Did Mischa say that?
-Yes, he did. Is this true?

Is it?

I want you to be the first to know
I'm engaged to Rosa.

-Mazel tov!
-Thank you.

But what about our news?

I onIy toId famiIy and friends
and Frankfurter.

Schmuck! You toId a barber!

A barber.
The biggest mouth in town.

Murderer.

I'm sorry, Jakob.
You want a partner?

Jakob, you need a partner?

You need a partner, Jakob?

He is my partner!

No! I work with SamueI.

I'm your partner, Jakob. Me.

Stop. I know bubkes.

How many kiIometres
did they make today?

Get off my back.

Excuse me. Your friend Jakob,
did he teII you about the front Iine?

WeII, he asked me not to say.

What?

Can he get the BBC?

BBC? Of course.

-PIease give me something.
-Go away.

Don't teII me you haven't Iistened
since yesterday.

Yesterday, there was
a program of dance music.

Maybe after work,
I couId teach you the tango.

Shit!

Listen.

There was a program
of music yesterday.

Russian music.

I'm teIIing you,
we'II never see the Russians.

We'II never see the Russians, eh?
So what are those?

Mr. Frankfurter, the Russians...

...they're going to bomb us.

This is the good news?

Germans.

They Iook Iike Germans to me.

Your information said they were
retreating under Russian attack.

They're fIying east and...

Use your brains a IittIe.

If the Germans are headed in that
direction, towards Bezanika...

...and the Russians are
headed there aIso, they say.

There, exactIy.

If the Russians are there, they're
not going to sit and have a picnic.

I don't think so.

-For this bread, three rutabagas.
-Two turnips!

No. For two turnips,
haIf a bread.

Three-quarters, because it's you.

Gonif.

Stay away from the train.

Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, pIease!

Roman, I heard voices coming
from those boxcars.

Are you crazy? Come on, come on.

The show is over!

Back to your work!

I heard voices, I teII you.

Pretend there are
just potatoes in there.

Oh, yes. It's the Iatest German
potatoes that taIk.

It's human voices!
We've got to speak to them.

What can you say to the dead?

What's the matter with you?

You toId us the Russians
wouId be there any moment.

-You want to keep that to yourseIf?
-It's none of our business.

What's wrong with you?

Sit down.

They have the right to know.

Eat.

I don't wanna eat.

Someone heIp me, pIease!

Hey! Do you hear me?

We have information.
The Russians are aImost here.

They're at Bezanika.

We aII saw the pIane.

Yes, pIease beIieve me.

You don't understand.

We have a radio!

You want to get kiIIed too?

You did this!

Did you have to shout from
the rooftops that the war is over?

Look where it got us!

Don't bIame yourseIf.

If HerscheI wanted to save the worId,
that was his choice.

We need more Jews Iike HerscheI.

At Ieast he tried to give
these peopIe some hope.

He's a hero Iike you.

I'm not a hero.

I'm a Iatke vendor.

A Iatke vendor with a radio.

Who just kiIIed a friend.

If you hang yourseIf, I'II kiII you.

Are you going to Iisten to London?

I can't take anymore.
You must teII me.

The Russians--

There are no Russians!
No radio! No nothing!

Understand?

What do you mean?

I mean I don't have the sIightest idea
where the Russians are.

I'm a Iiar! AII right?

You'II burn them. Let me do it.

I'm perfectIy capabIe
of frying mushrooms.

I know. I ran a restaurant
before the war.

A restaurant?

A very quaint one.

We made Iatkes.
You know, potato pancakes.

And bIintzes
stuffed with apricot jam.

And in the summer,
ice creams and fruit juices.

Did your wife work with you?

Why are you aIways asking questions?

Why do you never answer them?

I aIready ate.

Eat. After you've eaten,
you can do the washing up.

I hate washing up.

I did the cooking, didn't I?

When the war is over,
can I be a waitress?

What about schooI?

I'II go to schooI in the morning.
Afterwards, I'II serve customers.

You don't have to pay me. Just Iet me
eat as many pancakes as I want.

Just Iike KowaIsky.

Open the window.

Look, your friend the boxer.

Are they fighting?

Maybe Iater they're fighting.

Looks Iike Mischa thinks
the war is over.

He's trying to get her
to go to his apartment.

Doesn't she want to go?

-Very much.
-Then why doesn't she go?

You'II discover these things
when you're oIder.

When?

No more questions.

Spirit...

...if the Russians have reached Pry...

...knock twice.

Ask something usefuI, Iike where
your daughter is this time of night.

-She's with Mischa.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

He's invoIved with this troubIemaker
Heym. They'II drag Rosa into it.

On the other hand, if Rosa
doesn't sIeep home, it's better.

If they arrest us, she won't be here.

Some consoIation.

The days are difficuIt. Let them do
what they want with their nights.

So? Did you Iisten to the radio?
Any progress at the front?

Did the Russians
shoot down those pIanes?

Stop torturing me. The Germans are
aIready doing a fine job.

SamueI.

Is it suicide?

He just gave up and puIIed
the bIankets under his chin.

Stupid thing for SamueI to do,
when the Russians are that cIose.

Because they are, aren't they?

Yes, professor.

What?

The radio says they are.

So, Hannah...

... the truth can kill.

Samuel has died
because I told him the truth.

And that crazy Herschel
died because...

...he believed in news from a radio
that doesn't exist.

So that's dangerous too.

Whatever I do, I'm wrong.

Hunger for hope may be worse
than hunger for food.

So what's new?

I have to feed
them something, Hannah.

But what?

EIements of the 16th Army...

...supported by fIamethrowers
of the shock troops...

...of the Leningrad Division...

...are advancing with
mechanized armoured units...

...of StaIin's Soviet 6th Brigade...

...in an easterIy direction,
under massive air cover.

EasterIy?

They're headed the wrong way.

It's just a feint...

...to throw the Germans off.

ExactIy.

Why wouId they announce
that on the radio?

Strategy.

To make the Germans think
they're invading China.

Remember, it's a worId war.

ExactIy right.

For exampIe...

...in Africa, there are
tribes of cannibaIs...

...who've never seen a white man.

We don't want news about cannibaIs.

Why not?

We want to know if the Russians
are going to get here.

TechnicaIIy, they're retreating.
But strategicaIIy, they're advancing.

What does that mean?

Let me show you.

Here is the front Iine.

Here is Bezanika.
The Russians have that.

Here's Pry.
The Germans have that.

Here is the raiIroad junction
at the Rudna.

That's what the Luftwaffe
were protecting yesterday.

ExactIy right!

Germans don't want
the Americans to take that.

The Americans are in the war too?

They didn't say they were there.
They have probIems of their own.

They're fighting on another front.
But for now, they're sending tanks.

Tanks? How many?

Not many. But enough.

And brand-new, right off
the boat from Chicago.

Chicago?

How couId you teII
they were American?

You get to know the difference.

American tanks,
it's a different noise entireIy.

What kind of noise?

CIean.

Yeah, you can hear the horns.

-On the tank?
-No, the band.

They sent a jazz band
to cheer up their aIIies.

-Saxophone?
-CIarinet.

Sounds Iike Benny Goodman.

-Lady singers?
-Three of them.

-Andrew Sisters?
-Maybe their cousins.

It sounded so beautifuI.

And aII the time in the background,
I couId hear the Russian guns.

It's the most beautifuI thing
I've ever heard in my Iife.

You know, the jazz band...

...the artiIIery, everything.

It seems Iiberation is near.

Heym may not be the Messiah,
but he couId be a prophet.

Prophets speak in the name of God!

AII the pancake vendor has
is a radio!

He's saying the same thing
Isaiah said:

" PeopIe of IsraeI,
I wiII Iead you out of bondage."

"Out of bondage."

If this is what we get from Isaiah...

...I can't wait to find out
the resuIts from the pancake vendor.

He must be stopped.

Yeah, it is crazy.

I know, Hannah.

But when I started to make up
those things...

...I aImost beIieved them.

I know.

The point is, what am I going
to invent tomorrow?

In my whoIe Iife, my greatest
invention was an apricot pancake.

A Iatke.

My crowning achievement:

Latkes and Iies.

What are you doing here?

Look what I made for you.

I'm not hungry.

What do you mean, you're not hungry?

This is turnip soup,
made from reaI turnips.

It's deIicious.
Try it.

No, thank you.

You haven't eaten cat, have you?

Of course not.

Then it's the mushrooms.

-Those mushrooms were bad.
-Don't worry.

It's better not to be hungry
than to be hungry, isn't it?

Sneaky bastard. He's got
the radio in the attic, Rosa.

He's trying to get to London.
I'm sure of it.

Are you going to marry
Jakob Heym or me?

We're not the onIy two peopIe
in the worId.

Think about the resistance that'II
be organized because of this radio.

Maybe I shouId have put up
a IittIe more resistance.

Then you'd pay more attention to me.

Do you want more attention?

Maybe.

Come on.
Let's try to get some sIeep.

NapoIeon aIways made sure he got
a good night's sIeep...

...before his big battIes.

And he didn't do too badIy.

Go, go!
Get away, you bad cat!

Something is going on, I knew it.
I have to see where he's going.

-Mischa, it's curfew.
-I know!

What if the Russians attack
and I'm Iying here! Where's my hat?

I Iove you. You know that.

I Iove you too.

Look at this. Look here.

Your Mischa Ieaves our daughter home
so he can run around with Jakob.

Something must be done
about this nonsense.

Mischa! You frightened me!

That snob Kirschbaum is in on it too?
Why? Because he's a doctor?

Yeah, because he's a doctor.

Go! Leave me aIone!

I know you think I'm stupid,
but I'm not.

I know what's going on.

You heard a message from London
and you're going to teII Kirschbaum.

You were hit in the head
too many times, Mischa.

Good evening.

Professor doesn't see patients
at this time of the night.

I'm a personaI friend
of the doctor's.

ProfessionaI coIIeague
at the freight yard.

-Your name?
-My name is Jakob Heym.

The Jakob Heym?

I imagined you much taIIer.

So did I.

Come in.

Professor.

PIease sit down.

Here, my dipIoma.

Forty years ago,
more than 40 years.

I aIways knew this dipIoma...

...wouId come in usefuI.

What can I do for you?

I have a girI in my attic.

I'm a doctor, not a confessor.

No, pIease.
She's onIy 10 years oId.

She escaped from
one of the transports.

I've been taking care of her.
I'm doing my best...

...but I think she's very sick.

Come.

I'II show you my pharmacy.

There's nothing there.

Here, Iook.

AII I have.

The onIy medicine we couId give her
is some of your good news.

Like the American tanks.

I mean, even if the jazz band,
it's a IittIe too much.

Benny Goodman!

Don't you think so?

That's a wonderfuI medicine you have.
I mean, wonderfuI.

I admire what you're doing.
I reaIIy do.

Let's go and see
this IittIe friend of yours.

Esther, my bag
and my coat, pIease.

Pancakes...

Oh, my God!

Come on, it's me!

What, you need an emergency shave?

The Russians wiII be here whether
Heym has a radio or not, won't they?

I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

You and I are
in the same profession.

Who knows more about human nature
than actors and barbers?

You have your stage, I have mine.

Now I risk treading on yours
to make a soIemn pIea.

TeII your friend to destroy
the radio before it destroys us!

Destroy it? The radio?

Your friend, Jakob,
is preparing an uprising.

That's ridicuIous. This isn't
that kind of ghetto that rises up.

Even to think of it is bIasphemy.

Jews put their trust in God
to protect them!

We must admit that Iine of reasoning
hasn't gotten us very far.

If you don't beIieve me
about the uprising, answer this:

Why are Jakob and the prizefighter
waIking around after curfew?

Mischa is in this?

Up to his neck!

Stupid, stupid!

My God!
Anybody couId see us here!

What do you think?
They don't have eyes?

Quiet!

Professor, it's reaIIy
very important to me.

It's not very far.
Right this way.

CouId somebody pIease teII me
what's the point of this, pIease?

You see? What's he doing out
this time of night?

What are we doing out
at this time of night?

What's this?

When a man Ioses
his fear of the AImighty...

...he's capabIe of anything.

I hope to God not to find out
disgusting things about Heym.

What do you mean?

His private affairs are none
of our concern. Look for the radio!

OnIy an idiot wouId hide
a radio in the kitchen.

Maybe we shouId try the ceIIar.

Good idea.

Yes, the ceIIar.

Let's go.

Let's get out of here.

This way, professor.

Oh, my God! He's here!

Not so fast.

OnIy one more fIoor.

Hide!

Shut up!

SIow down.
I have a heart condition.

-I'm exhausted.
-Right here.

Wait, wait, wait.

I need to rest, need to rest.

What if the Russians said that?

You're right.

Kirschbaum is part of the Resistance.
I wouId have bet money on it.

He keeps it in the attic!

Jakob, there are thieves
in your apartment.

My apartment?

What's to steaI?

Now, come on.

Lie down.

And you do everything
the professor says.

Let's see.

Stick out your tongue Iike a frog
trying to catch a fIy, and say, "Ah."

AII we have here
is a IittIe tummy ache.

Too much ice cream.

ChocoIate, maybe?

She's very sick.

BoiIed water onIy...

...and some of your medicine, maybe.

It's in here.

If they're Iistening to the radio,
we wouId be considered accompIices.

Oh, my God!

We'd better wait for them there.

That's a good point. I Iove
your point. Let's get out of here.

What are you doing here?

My God, KowaIsky. You too?

Yes. You know, I think it's
reaIIy for the best. I reaIIy do.

I don't know if you reaIize the danger
in which we have been pIaced.

There are ghetto informers who wiII
do anything for a few potatoes.

Therefore, I beg you,
as a father and a husband...

...pIease destroy that radio
before the Germans find out.

You want me to destroy my radio?

I do, yes.

AII right.

I'II destroy it.

It's a dangerous thing,
I admit that.

Destroy the radio.

But since Mr. Heym has accepted
to share the information with us...

...there has not been a singIe case
of suicide in the entire ghetto.

-Is true?
-It is true!

The professor has a good point.

-Very good point.
-Think about it.

It saves Iives.

That's very good reason to keep it.

I have a suggestion.

What?

We couId Iisten to the Iatest news
and then destroy the radio.

That's a good idea.

My God! These idiots
want to defy you once again.

Stop them! I beg you!

It's a power cut.

It's a miracIe!

Sorry, gentIemen.

No more radio. No more news.

Good night.
Thank you for coming.

No eIectricity. None.

It's sabotage.

-It's sabotage of the Resistance.
-Resistance?

Stop!

-Come on. We go back.
-We can't go back!

Thank you.

It's a miracIe.

No, it's sabotage.

-It's a miracIe.
-It's sabotage.

-MiracIe!
-It's sabotage, I'm teIIing you.

MiracIe, miracIe, miracIe!

Shut up!

Here, drink.

Because you've got to get weII...

...because your parents
are coming back.

And when they do, we're gonna have
the biggest party you ever seen.

I'II be back.

Is it true you've got a radio?

Not you too?

PIease. I've heard you have a radio.
I'd reaIIy Iike to see it.

I was a baby
when they took ours away.

If you promise me to get weII...

...I promise you,
you can Iisten to my radio...

...if the power comes back on.

Do you mean it?

WouId I Iie to you?

-So what's new?
-New? Oy!

Anybody wouId think you were happy
about the power cut.

God's wiII be done.

I think that green stuff
is working.

Stamtisch never compIained.

I know I'm not a member
of the cIub...

...but you might want to hear
my idea anyway.

-I don't.
-You see?

Mischa was thinking, Mr. Heym...

...if the eIectricity
can't come to your radio...

...you can take your radio
to the eIectricity.

What are you taIking about?

EIectricity.

See? OnIy certain streets
are affected.

We couId bring the radio here.

Bring the radio here?

Oh, it's a great idea.

It's the best idea
I ever heard in my Iife.

What a wonderfuI idea.
Bring it here.

AbsoIuteIy. Put up a big sign
in PoIish and German...

...so everyone wiII know
there's a radio in my shop.

I couId charge admission with Iow
prices for the Gestapo and soIdiers.

Put up Ioudspeakers.
I couId seII refreshments.

What about dances
between news reports?

I'II shave the Luftwaffe
before they hang me.

I'II teII you why it won't work.

I know Jakob better than anyone.

He won't give you the dirt
from under his fingernaiIs...

...Iet aIone Iend you
his precious radio.

You're saying I'm cheap?

What eIse do you caII a man who's got
free shaves daiIy for 4 years...

...without giving so much as a sniff
of a pancake in return?

I thought you were my friend.

Friends can say these things
about each other.

So shaII we go and fetch it?

-What if the Germans see us with it?
-What if they damage it?

It's a shame there're
no chiIdren Ieft.

We couId've put it
in a chiId's coffin.

The Germans don't pay much attention
to dead chiIdren.

-Let's go.
-No. We can't.

-Why?
-It'd never work.

No, he'II never Iet you do it.

He'II say it costs
too much in eIectricity.

-You're saying I'm cheap?
-You're not?

-I'm cheap?
-You are.

-You're cheap!
-You're cheaper!

You're supposed to have
a pancake for a shave.

But you don't have one.
You eat five pancakes every morning.

You stuff your face
untiI you can't get up!

Bring the damn radio!
I'II show you how cheap I am!

No, you're not that cheap!

Now that's a mensch.

And a meshuggenah!
KowaIsky, wait!
