He drove his car straight into a wall.

Either his car failed on him,
or he was committing suicide.

He's completely unconscious.

In the center of Los Angeles!

I made it!

Around nine o'clock, Clara.

Just now. I just got off the truck.

Look, I'll have you
and the little one here in no time.

Five thousand dollars.

What's five thousand dollars hers?

Hers, the gringos earn in green bills!

How did you get this?

I killed someone
who looked just like you.

Come on, what do you think?
I have friends.

You better treat it like your son.

It costs a lot of money to buy
this shit on the black market.

You're gonna go to heaven for this!

I got your back, bro.
Welcome to the United States!

They get ten dollars an hour, plus tips!

That's four times what we get!

You know why?
They think we have nowhere to go.

We have to do something, bro.

We're not going in today.
We're on strike.

Are you nuts?

We'll get fired.

We're gonna teach that asshole a lesson.

He thinks he can pay us shit
just 'cause we're illegal.

Well, no more.

Easy for you to say.
You don't have a wife and a kid.

Listen to me, man.

I'm the one who got you that job,

and I say we don't go today.

I came here to make money.

Every penny I earn I send back home.

Don't count on me.

I'm not risking my job.

You and Spikey can stay
and play house. Not me.

If you're gonna be that Paki's bitch,

better pack your shit and leave,
'cause you're not coming back hers.

Fins with me.

Welcome to the United States.

You guys wanna work?

Eighteen Months Later

Taka-san?

Taka-san!

Why?

Can I borrows pen?

What's the date today?

March 30th.

And the year?

2004.

30/03/2004. Born again.

You took care of me all this while?

Thank you very much for your kindness.

You're welcome.

One year later

Tuesday cloudy day.

Do you love me?

Thursday cloudy day.

What's up?

I know.

He's a bit slow.

Saturday sunny day.
Made a friend. An American.

Do you love me?

You're doing a good job, Julio.

That car's pretty sweet.
So smooth!

I've never driven anything
so smooth before.

Here we drive the best cars
and get paid for it.

You're right!

It's the best job in the world.

Hey, they're waiting.

I miss you a lot.

What are you wearing?

What?

Oscar! What are you doing up so late?

Did you like the sweater I sent you?

That's good.

You be good, okay?
Go to bed already.

Pass me to your mom.

I miss you so much, Clara.

I know it's been...

I know I already promised,
but things are gonna change.

The flower shop is doing well.
I already saved $4,000.

I promise. This time it will happen.

Saturday sunny day.
Made a friend. An American.

I saw a man talk to his can

It was beautiful... so intimate.

The thing is,
I lost my partner in the flower shop.

Don't worry. I'm taking care of it.

Come on! it's time!

Hey, I gotta go.
I gotta run a staff meeting.

I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

I love you.

Thanks.

Good luck in America!
