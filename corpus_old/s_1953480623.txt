<i>Once upon a time,</i>

<i>in a magical land...</i>

<i>An evil queen...</i>

I will not let them defeat me.

<i>Unleashed a powerful curse.</i>

The curse! It's here!

<i>And banished</i>
<i>every fairy tale character...</i>

Where are we going?
Somewhere horrible.

<i>To a place without magic.</i>

Welcome to Storybrooke.

They don't remember who they are.

<i>And for 28 years...</i>

Do you know this man?

<i>Their lives and memories</i>

<i>were stolen.</i>

No. Why? Who is he?

<i>Until...</i>

What's her name?

Her name is Emma.

<i>The one person who could save them...</i>

Are you Emma Swan? I'm her son.

<i>Came back into their lives.</i>

Do you believe <i>now?</i>

<i>And broke the spell.</i>

<i>Now...</i>

Snow!
Charming.

<i>Their memories have awakened...</i>

What do you want?

<i>And magic has returned.</i>

Magic? In Storybrooke?

You stay back!

<i>And with it...</i>
Aah!

<i>Comes a price...</i>
You're not gonna believe what I saw.

<i>That everyone...</i>
That boy...

<i>Must pay.</i>
is more than he appears.

No!

And that is how magic is made.

<i>Until just recently,</i>

<i>Storybrooke, Maine, was</i>
<i>a quiet, out-of-the-way place.</i>

<i>To shed light on the notable</i>
<i>events in this tiny town,</i>

<i>we turn to "Once Upon A Time" creators</i>

<i>Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz.</i>

Well, Storybrooke is a town
that, in many ways,

is... is kind of lost in time.

The curse was enacted 28 years
ago in 1983.

The town itself is sort of timeless,

which you'll see with
the rotary phones and the cars.

This town was created
with all these characters

from all these fairy tales
who don't know who they are.

So you have Jiminy Cricket
is now Dr. Hopper.

And Granny runs the diner with Ruby,

who is, of course,
Little Red Riding Hood.

Oh!

Mayor Mills, I am so sorry.

<i>The town's mayor is Regina Mills,</i>

<i>the Evil Queen who enacted the curse</i>

<i>that brought them all to Storybrooke.</i>

<i>Regina's son Henry has not</i>
<i>always seen eye to eye</i>

<i>with his mother.</i>

Where have you been?

I found my <i>real</i> mom.

<i>And when Henry's</i>
<i>biological mother Emma Swan</i>

<i>entered their lives,</i>

<i>Regina tried everything</i>
<i>she could to eliminate her.</i>

I do hope you like apples.

What happened at the end of season one

was Henry accidentally ate

an apple turnover that had
a sleeping curse in it...

I love you, Henry.

And Emma, with true love's kiss,

awoke Henry and actually
broke the curse.

Oh! I love you, too.

<i>In that moment,</i>

<i>the residents of Storybrooke</i>
<i>regained their memories...</i>

<i>But as they celebrated</i>
<i>a joyful reunion...</i>

Snow?
Oh!

<i>A powerful force was about</i>
<i>to descend upon the town.</i>

Mr. Gold, otherwise known
as Rumplestiltskin,

brought magic to this land.

Magic... is coming.

He has now changed
the playing field.

What is that?

Both good and bad
can wield magic,

and what is that gonna mean
for them in their lives?

Yeah, we know that magic
always comes with a price,

and a lot of this season
is about paying it.

The Dark One summons thee.

<i>And the first measure of payback came</i>

<i>when Mr. Gold brought a wraith</i>
<i>to Storybrooke.</i>

This creature marks its victims,

and does not stop
until it achieves its goal,

which is sucking
the very essence of its victim

out of them. It's a fairy
tale Terminator, really.

Yeah. But our heroes came up
with what they thought

was a clever plan,
to take the Mad Hatter's hat,

which can create portals between worlds,

and throw the wraith into it.

Aah! No!

No!

Uhh!

<i>The plan worked,</i>

<i>sending the wraith to another world.</i>

<i>But it dragged mother</i>
<i>and daughter along with it.</i>

Mulan, what is this?

That is what brought the wraith here.

We have to get back to them.

The Enchanted Forest is not
as you remember it.

Leaving is unwise.

A lot of times, we'll flashback
to these characters

and the lives they had before the curse.

But this year, we introduced

the Enchanted Forest in present day.

Or as we like to say,

a post-apocalyptic Enchanted Forest.

<i>Mary Margaret had returned home,</i>

<i>but the land she knew as Snow White</i>

<i>had dramatically changed.</i>

When the curse was enacted
in season one,

there was a small pocket
of Fairytale land

that was protected.

This corner of land
is untouched.

No one knows why.
But something saved us.

And within that small pocket,

there were characters
who were still existing...

among them, Captain Hook...

Mulan and Aurora...

Lancelot.

Lancelot? Really?

He's an old friend.

Well... a fake Lancelot.

Clever girl.

Where's Lancelot?

I killed him a <i>long</i> time ago.

<i>Regina's mother Cora</i>

<i>was among those who remained</i>
<i>in the Enchanted Forest.</i>

Uhh!

Where is she?
Gone.

So Emma, who is within hours
of becoming a believer,

finds herself
in an actual enchanted forest.

Do exactly as I say,
and you might survive.

Thanks for the pep talk,
but I think we're okay.

Have you ever seen an ogre?

Pretty sure I've dated a few.

What <i>is</i> the plan?
You haven't told me anything.

What's going on?

Emma is a character
who can handle herself.

You wanna see
where you're from, Emma?

We're going home.

So Emma gets
a little headstrong at first...

And is firing guns up into the air.

But she doesn't know... well,
you know what noise attracts?

Ogres?
 - Ogres.

Run!

And fighting ogres is not easy

and it's more helpful
when you have your mom with you.

Back away from my daughter!

For the first season,

Mary Margaret was a schoolteacher

who didn't have a lot of confidence.

And now Emma realizes
her mom is Snow White,

who can take care of herself
and knows how to kill an ogre.

When was the last time
you shot an arrow?

28 years ago.

I guess it's like riding a bike.

Emma goes from not believing
that any of this exists

to climbing a beanstalk
to find the last giant,

so that she can find a compass
to return home.

And she does it rather deftly, I think.

Is that it?

That's our home.

She also got to see where
she was from for the first time.

I recognize this from Henry's book.

She's been on her own forever,

and didn't think she had

any place that she was really from,

and now she's discovering
it's this magical land,

and she's going to see the castle

where she was supposed
to be raised as a princess.

I lived here?

I was going to teach you
how to walk in here.

It's this amazing mix
of emotions for Emma,

of seeing what could've been for her.

We never got to be a family.

We have a family... in Storybrooke.

And right now, they need us
to get back there.

<i>Their search for a way back home</i>

<i>led to Rumplestiltskin's prison cell.</i>

<i>But Cora was also trying</i>
<i>to get to Storybrooke.</i>

<i>- And the magic compass...</i>
Ahh.

<i>Was her ticket.</i>

We'd love to stay, but Storybrooke awaits.

Where we going?

Lake Nostros.

Its waters hold the power
to restore what was once lost.

We'll be able to cross worlds.

<i>The Enchanted Forest</i>
<i>is but one of many realms.</i>

The stories that we know in our
world exist in different realms.

Some exist in the realm
we call Fairytale Land,

and some exist in the realm
we call Wonderland.

You wanna go in <i>there?</i>

There's another realm without color,

where we saw Frankenstein.

Good evening, doctor.

Rumple Von Stiltskin.

A foreigner.
What tipped you off? My rosy complexion?

Things that can get you between worlds

can work in many different ways.

There is the hat, like the Mad Hatter's.

Please stand back.

You can go through
the looking-glass

to get to Wonderland.

Who are you?

Then there are magic beans

that can take you
anywhere you wanna go...

Welcome aboard.

But those are a rare commodity

and they were thought to be extinct.

This bean, can this make a portal?

It was destroyed like the rest of them.

So there are many different ways
to travel.

Sparkly dirt. Wonderful.

Just the remains of a magical wardrobe.

You'll be able to see your daughter,

and I can skin myself a crocodile.

<i>Cora was a miller's daughter,</i>

<i>and as a young woman,</i>

<i>she and her father</i>
<i>barely made ends meet.</i>

<i>It was a difficult life.</i>

Aah!

You stupid, foolish girl!

What happened here?

Uh, the peasant fell...

as they do.

You shall receive no money
for the flour,

and you will apologize to Eva.

Apologize? The wench tripped <i>me.</i>

Curb your tongue.

Cora has never gotten over
the scars of her youth.

This woman tells me that she can
spin straw into gold.

Magic is about emotion.

<i>Cora found a mentor in Rumplestiltskin,</i>

<i>who taught her the ways of dark magic.</i>

What do you want to do to them?

Cora's obsessed with power.

She's obsessed with status.

I want to make them <i>bow.</i>

She's obsessed with winning
at all costs.

Look.

I did it.

Rumplestiltskin was the only man
Cora ever loved.

They were almost like soul mates.

The king humiliated me.

I want to kill him,

show him his heart

as I <i>crush</i> it.

I wanted a heart,
and a heart I shall have.

Uhh!

<i>Hearts are a commodity in some circles.</i>

When you rip a person's
heart out, you can control them.

Rise.

It becomes enchanted,
like a super heart.

It's perfect.

And it is, uh, able to be crushed

or is able to be controlled.

That the two of you could've

gotten the remains of the wardrobe.

Or store it in a vault for rainy day.

These are all hearts.

My mother was a collector.

And we see this season
that it's not an easy skill.

Take its heart.

Regina struggled with it at first.

She can't do it to a poor unicorn.

Oh!

And I had such high hopes.

Uhh!

You're not hurting the beast.

You're controlling it.

<i>But when young Cora</i>
<i>attempted to use this power</i>

<i>to exact her revenge on the king,</i>

<i>she came to a realization.</i>

Couldn't you take the king's heart?

I chose not to.

Whose heart is in the box?

Mine.

You told me not to let anything stop me

until they're on their knees.

My heart was stopping me.

When she ripped
her own heart out

to break up with Rumplestiltskin,

he never got over that.

You never loved me.

The fact that she took
her own heart out

made her heartless,
and that was what enabled her

to do all the cruel acts she did.

But if you ask her, she's doing
it for the right reasons.

Her name is Regina,

for one day she will be queen.

She does love her daughter.
 - Yes.

And she does want what's best for her.

It's just, Cora's idea of what's
best for her is probably not

what any right-minded person's
idea would be.

You ride like a man.

Theirs was
a dysfunctional relationship.

Who's going to want to marry you
when you behave like a...

Commoner?

Cora wanted Regina, from birth,
to be queen...

Yeah.

And Regina didn't always want that.

She wanted love.

Let's go.

<i>And when Regina tried to run away</i>

<i>with the stable boy Daniel...</i>

Uhh!

Mother!

Aah!

<i>Cora eliminated</i>
<i>her daughter's true love.</i>

Which, unfortunately for Cora,

resulted in her being sent
to Wonderland.

<i>Years later, while planning the curse,</i>

<i>Regina wanted to ensure</i>

<i>her mother would not follow her</i>
<i>to the land without magic...</i>

It's now enchanted.

It will enable you to rip out her heart.

<i>So she sent Captain Hook</i>
<i>to Wonderland to kill Cora.</i>

What?

I'm the Queen of <i>Hearts.</i>

Do you really think I'd be so careless

as to keep my heart
where everyone else does?

This...
Aah!

Uhh!
is how it's done.

<i>But Cora and Hook found common ground,</i>

<i>and the two joined forces.</i>

When the curse was
enacted, it was Cora

who creates a shield that covers
a corner of Fairytale Land

where she and Hook can wait.

The curse won't
last forever. It <i>will</i> end.

And when it does,

Regina will truly have lost everything,

and then she'll need me.

<i>That's</i> when we'll go to this new land.

Cora knows to reunite with her daughter,

she's gotta get to Storybrooke.

When Emma and Mary Margaret find
their way into Fairytale Land,

Cora discovers the remnants
of the wardrobe

that sent Emma to our world
to begin with.

And that becomes the key to her plan

to find a way back
to our world and to Regina.

You're not going anywhere!
The portal's taking us home.

The compass, get it.

<i>Snow and Emma had escaped</i>
<i>from Rumplestiltskin's cell</i>

<i>and were determined to use Cora's portal</i>

<i>to get back to Storybrooke.</i>

Emma, run!

<i>But Cora had other plans.</i>

Good-bye, Snow.
No!

Emma!

Oh, you foolish girl! Love is weakness.

Cora represents
the darkness of magic.

Emma represents the light.

No. It's strength.

Within Emma <i>is</i> magic...

What was that?

And the ability to wield magic,

and that's not something
just anyone can do.

That...

is a great subject for discussion...

when we get home!

<i>But there was danger</i>

<i>at the other end of the portal</i>
<i>in Storybrooke,</i>

<i>and Henry looked to Regina for help.</i>

You said you wanted to change,

to be better.

This is how.

She was able
to absorb that magic

and diffuse it.

Yeah. She saved Snow White's life.

Mom?

Oh! Henry!

Mom!

Oh!

Regina every now and then
has her moment,

and that was one of them

where she did something selfless
and she did something brave

because she loved Henry.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Even though we love
watching her be bad,

it's moments like that

that make you want her to find
her own happy ending.

We failed.

Really, Cora,

why do you still doubt me?

Fortunately for Cora,

Hook stole the desiccated bean
from the giant.

And through that, they were cunning enough

to get their way to Storybrooke.

There it is.

Storybrooke.

This, gentlemen, is our mission.

We must investigate the line.

<i>After the curse was broken,</i>

<i>not all was perfect in Storybrooke.</i>

All magic comes with a price,

and the price for bringing it
is anyone who leaves Storybrooke

will revert back to their curse memory.

You know, what if we found a turtle

and sorta nudged it over first?

Oh, for the love of...

Uhh!

Terrible news! Terrible news!

For instance, Sneezy becomes
Mr. Clark, the pharmacist.

If you cross the border, you
lose your memory all over again.

So now Gold is faced
with a dilemma.

He wants to find his son,

but the moment he leaves town,
he won't know who he is.

Yeah, he won't remember what he
was looking for to begin with.

Milah!

<i>Long ago, in the Enchanted Forest,</i>

<i>Rumplestiltskin was branded a coward.</i>

Milah!

<i>He deserted his countrymen</i>
<i>on the battlefield</i>

<i>to be with his newborn son.</i>

Milah!
Rumple.

What's his name?

Baelfire.

A strong name!

Something he'll need,

if he's to live with the shame
of being your son.

<i>Rumple's actions strained his marriage.</i>

Milah, it's time to go.

Who's this?

Eh, it's just my husband.

Oh. Well, he's a tad taller
than you described.

When we first meet Captain Hook,
he's Killian Jones,

and he's just doing what pirates do,

which is carousing at bars

and, you know, taking what he wants.

I... I remember you.

It's always nice to make an impression.

Unfortunately for Rumplestiltskin,

he wants Rumple's wife.

You see, we have a son,
and he needs his mother.

You see, I have a ship
full of men who need...

companionship.

And Rumple is a broken man,

having lost his wife,
and now he's a single father.

Women do not like to be married
to <i>cowards.</i>

Please don't speak
to my boy like that.

<i>Afraid of losing his son as well,</i>

<i>Rumplestiltskin summoned The Dark One...</i>

<i>A master of dark magic.</i>

Die!
<i>But by killing him,</i>

<i>Rumple transformed</i>
<i>into The Dark One himself.</i>

But unfortunately,
Rumple became a little crazy

with the power of being The Dark One,

and his son tried to return him
to the father that he loved

and he knew before
he became The Dark One.

A magic bean... the very last one
that is known to our kind.

You follow wherever it leads you.

<i>Bae made a deal with his father</i>
<i>to begin a new life</i>

<i>in a land without magic.</i>

We have to go through!

No, no! I don't think I can!

You coward! Don't break our deal!

I have to!

Papa!

No!

Rumple is faced with
a choice between power and love.

He let his son go

because he couldn't give up
the powers of The Dark One.

But he missed his son

so much that he brought magic
to Storybrooke.

I did it.

You can cross the town line?

Indeed I can.

He discovered a way

by finding an item that was
really important to him.

This shawl is all I have left
of my Baelfire.

By enchanting that,
he would be able to leave

and retain his memories.

But then a complication comes into play

when Hook arrives.

Well, my dear Cora,

it's time for me to skin my crocodile.

When Rumplestiltskin
has become The Dark One

and is on his quest to find his son,

he happens upon Killian Jones.

You! Even gutter rats have more
manners than you just displayed.

Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry, sir.

Ah. I was wrong. Not a rat at all.

More like a crocodile.

And Rumple now knows as The Dark One,

he's got the ability
to exact the vengeance

in a way that, for pre-Dark One,

Rumplestiltskin couldn't do it.

Do you know what it's like to
have your wife stolen from you?

It feels like having your heart
ripped from your chest.

Uhh!

Stop!

The unexpected surprise
is coming across Milah,

not as a prisoner
but as a willing companion

to Killian Jones.

Oh, I feel a proposal coming on.

The magic bean in exchange
for our lives.

And once again,
Rumple is faced with a choice

between power and love.

He can let his wife and Captain Hook go

and sail off in the world,

and have a bean that will
reunite him with his son,

or he can exact revenge.

And in true Rumple fashion,
he can't help himself.

Milah!

And he does it Rumple-style,

which is ripping out your heart

and squeezing it in front
of until you fall over dead,

while your loved one watches.

And then cutting their hand off.

Aah!

Aah!

Killing me is gonna take
a lot more than that, dearie.

I will find a way.

Well, good luck living long enough.

And that is how Captain Hook is born.

And he will do whatever it takes
and he will align himself

with whomever will get him
to Rumplestiltskin

so he can exact revenge.

<i>At the Storybrooke town line,</i>

<i>Mr. Gold was ready</i>
<i>to put his potion to the test.</i>

Belle.

It... it worked!

Now you can find your son.

Uhh!

I wouldn't count on it.

Belle?

Belle?!

Belle!

Who... who... who's Belle?

<i>Hook's attack had</i>
<i>robbed Belle of her memory.</i>

<i>But before Gold could strike back,</i>

<i>Storybrooke had an unexpected visitor.</i>

What's going on?

Shh! Shh! Shh!
Ow!

Over here!

<i>Suddenly, Storybrooke was exposed.</i>

Do you know this guy?
 - Never seen him before.

Looks like the world
just came to Storybrooke.

When the curse was broken
and magic was brought,

Storybrooke was suddenly visible.

Anyone could drive in.

Why are my instincts telling me
that's a bad thing?

'Cause you've seen "E. T." or "Splash"

or any other movie where
they find something magical

and study it to death.

Think what'd they do to a werewolf.

So, Mr. Mendell,

I do need you to state what you saw.

I didn't see anything.

Oh.

I looked down, just for a second,

and when I looked back up,
he was right there.

And he was too close to avoid.

In season one, we saw Emma
was able to come to Storybrooke.

We saw August was able
to come to Storybrooke.

But these were people who were
a part of Fairytale Land.

And born in the Enchanted Forest.
Right.

Pinocchio, in 28 years,

you must make sure the savior believes.

<i>Pinocchio was charged</i>
<i>with great responsibility</i>

<i>when he and baby Emma journeyed</i>
<i>to a new world.</i>

<i>But not long after, they found</i>
<i>a home in an orphanage.</i>

Shh. Shh.

<i>Pinocchio left Emma</i>
<i>to fend for herself...</i>

I told my father I'd take care of Emma.

We can't take care of a baby.

I'm sorry, Emma.

<i>And Emma grew up living a life of crime.</i>

We got to see what Emma was like
before Storybrooke...

a woman on her own.

Impressive.

But really, you could've just
asked me for the keys.

And that's when she meets Neal.

This isn't your car either, is it?

She's actually met a kindred spirit

because he's also stealing the car.

20 minutes till housekeeping.

What they knew at a young age was

the simple things were
the important things.

It's not much of a home.

Maybe it's time we get a real place.

Being with each other...
Yeah.

Being in love and finding
a place to be together.

Like where, Neverland?

I'm serious. We could do this.

They just wanted to live their lives

and they wanted to find a family
and they wanted to be together.

Are you sure? Is this what
you really want?

What I really want is you.

Emma was always
a character searching for home.

Unfortunately, destiny got
in the way of that.

<i>Emma and Neal planned to use</i>
<i>cash from stolen watches</i>

<i>to begin their life together.</i>

There's $20,000 easy.

$20,000?!

<i>But Neal was faced</i>
<i>with greater forces at work.</i>

Tragically, Emma's role as savior

and her place in this greater story

came into play and broke them apart.

She has a destiny,

and you're gonna keep her from it.

<i>Pinocchio had returned.</i>

<i>He had changed his name</i>
<i>to August Booth...</i>

When you see what I have in here,

you're gonna believe every word I say.

<i>And he knew Neal's true identity.</i>

I was tasked with keeping her on track,

and you just got caught
in the crossfire.

<i>Neal left Emma</i>
<i>to face prosecution alone,</i>

<i>placing her on</i>
<i>a challenging path to destiny.</i>

Let's go.

Emma already had her guard up,

and this was a time
where she let it down,

and she would never let it down
again except for Henry.

Please? I told you about your parents.

Family's important to the show

because it is something
that everybody needs

and it is something
that everybody looks for.

Your dad was training to be a fireman.

Did you get married?

Oh, no, nothing like that.

I was pregnant with you,
and I tried to contact him.

I found out that he died

saving a family from
a burning apartment building.

I need to find someone,

so we're leaving today.

Find someone? Who?

My son.

<i>With the help of an enchanted globe,</i>

<i>Mr. Gold found Bae's location.</i>

<i>And with Henry and Emma,</i>

<i>he crossed the town line.</i>

<i>But that was only the first leg</i>
<i>of the journey.</i>

Seeing Mr. Gold going through
a security line

and getting on a plane,
which in a lot of ways

is one of this world's
most magical things...

it's something that can fly
in the air...

It's gonna be all right.

He was venturing into a world
he had never known.

That was, for us,
the inspiration for that story.

Let me guess...
he's not expecting you.

Well, who doesn't love a surprise?

Emma and Gold and Henry make
their way to New York City...

He's running.

And they track down Baelfire.

Get him to talk to me. I... I can't run.

And it is a shock to Emma

to discover that Baelfire,
Rumplestiltskin's son,

is actually Neal...

Neal?
Emma?

The love of her life
from ten years earlier.

Now we have a very messy family reunion.

Bae.

Get out of my apartment!

Neal...
Emma, I got this.

You two know each other how?

Mom, what's going on?

Whoa. Who's this?

My son.
What?

Is that Baelfire?

And now Neal discovering

that not only did he break Emma's heart,

but he left behind a son...

Is this my son?

Mom?

A son who's completely confused

because he's been lied to by his mother.

Yes.

Rumplestiltskin
is Henry's grandfather?

Apparently.

So his... stepgrandmother is Regina?

Yeah, I think Charming summed it up

when he said Thanksgivings
would suck at that house.

So you're really from... there?

Yeah, I am.

<i>As Henry got to know his father,</i>

<i>Gold pressed Emma to help</i>
<i>smooth things over with Neal.</i>

So, uh, you talk to him?

It's complicated.

Oh, I see.

Maybe he just needs some time.
I don't know.

Uhh! Aah!

<i>But there was a bigger problem.</i>

Uhh! Aah! Oh!

Time's up, crocodile.

Aah!

Uhh!

Gold, are you all right?

<i>After the curse was finally</i>
<i>broken in Storybrooke...</i>

Johanna?

<i>Long-lost friends found</i>
<i>one another again.</i>

Snow.

Oh! Oh, ho ho!

Snow.

Mother.

<i>When Snow White was a young girl...</i>

<i>Her mother, Queen Eva, fell deathly ill.</i>

<i>Johanna was a royal servant...</i>

Is she going to die?

<i>And she cared for Snow</i>
<i>during this difficult time.</i>

I don't want to lose her.

Snow White was trying to save
her mother's life,

and Cora, pretending to be
the Blue Fairy,

offered her a candle.

This candle can
save your mother's life.

But all magic comes with a price.

And the price would be
another person's life.

You most hold this candle over
the heart of your sacrifice.

<i>Snow was unwilling to sacrifice a life,</i>

<i>even to save her own mother,</i>

<i>and Eva died.</i>

<i>Cora's manipulation of young Snow</i>

<i>was just the beginning.</i>

Snow would've been a great ruler
someday,

but that'll never happen

because my daughter will be queen.

<i>Regina did become the queen...</i>

Uhh!

<i>And she spent much of her reign</i>

<i>at war with Snow White</i>
<i>and Prince Charming.</i>

Leaving the battle so soon?

The battle's over, Regina.

I offer to negotiate the terms
of your surrender.

My terms are quite simple...

your death.

Now!

You should have surrendered
when I gave you the chance.

The tragedy, I think,
between the two of them is,

Snow White as a young girl
always looked up to Regina.

She saved her life, and she's
always hoping she returns

to the person she met when she
was in love with the stable boy.

<i>The queen faced execution,</i>
<i>but Snow showed mercy.</i>

This is a chance to start fresh, Regina,

to leave the evil behind in this cell.

Just like that?

Just like that.

There's so much
bitterness and anger,

almost like a blood feud between them

that we wonder, how will
they ever work it out?

You make change sound so easy.

Every time she starts to redeem herself,

something seems to get in the way.

<i>In Storybrooke,</i>
<i>Regina wanted nothing more</i>

<i>than to earn Henry's love...</i>

<i>But it would be more difficult</i>
<i>than it seemed.</i>

Mother.

Cora gets to Storybrooke
and realizes that

to get Regina to forgive her
for oh, so many transgressions,

she's got to have her daughter need her.

I want my daughter back.

Let me into your heart.

Regina really does want
her mother's love and approval.

But more importantly,
I think Regina wants Henry.

Together, we can get him back again.

And she feels like,
redeeming myself and being good

is taking too long,

and my mom's offering me a shortcut.

Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

If we possess the dagger,
we control The Dark One.

I'll use that dagger
to force The Dark One

to kill anyone you like.

<i>Cora's plan would leave Regina</i>
<i>blameless in Henry's eyes,</i>

<i>but David and Mary Margaret</i>

<i>were not about to let that happen.</i>

We did it.

The Dark One finally can be controlled.

Indeed he can be.

But by whom?

What Cora's looking for is
to become The Dark One herself.

Johanna!

Uhh!
Aah!

Your choice.

Aah! Uhh!

The dagger, dear.

Enough!

You have what you came for.

Not quite everything.

Aah! Aah!

In that moment,
Mary Margaret kind of snapped...

You see where good gets you?

And she started to say,

had I got rid of Regina years ago,

I would have seen my daughter grow up,

and none of this would've happened.

She needs to be killed.

This is our family.
We are going to protect it.

Of course we will,

but not by your hand
and not out of vengeance.

Why? Because you wouldn't be
able to live with yourself.

We gotta get him to an E.R. fast.

<i>In New York,</i>
<i>Mr. Gold's injury was serious.</i>

There's gotta be some way
we can save you.

There is. There is.

Storybrooke. There's magic there now.

<i>Captain Hook's ship</i>
<i>provided quick passage,</i>

<i>and Gold made it back to Storybrooke.</i>

My cabinet.

<i>And while Cora had possession</i>
<i>of the dagger,</i>

<i>he had his own powerful weapon.</i>

The candle can save me.
There's nothing else.

I wouldn't use this
to save my own mother.

What makes you think
I would use it for you?

For once, our interests are aligned.

Snow White started to wonder,

what did being good ever get me?

Maybe the path, uh, I've been on

is only causing more heartache.

And in a moment of weakness
and in a moment of anger...

Cora.

<i>- Cora.</i>
She lit the candle

and she gave that heart back to Regina.

She can't love you, you know.
She doesn't have her heart.

With it, maybe she can.

<i>For a brief moment, Cora felt the love</i>

<i>she had denied herself</i>
<i>for so many years.</i>

Mother.

<i>But the feeling wouldn't last.</i>

Mother?
Oh!

M... mother?

Oh.

This...

would've been enough.

Mother?

What am I gonna do?

You did this.

Hey. They said I'm good to go,

but, you know, I think I'm gonna
stay here for a little while.

Why?

Well, take a look at this and see.

<i>The outsider in Storybrooke</i>
<i>had reason to stay.</i>

Greg actually witnessed magic

and he is fascinated by this magic,

and he is staying around town
to document it.

Why he's there and what his
connection to Storybrooke is

is explained when we take a look back

at the, uh, the first day of the curse.

Now pull the loops as tight as you can.

Mm. Ah, look at that!

When Regina first cast the curse,

Storybrooke landed in the middle
of the forest in Maine,

right by a campsite
of a father and a son.

This is impossible.

It's like someone dropped a town
right on top of us.

<i>Storybrooke's unexpected</i>
<i>visitors soon met the mayor.</i>

You're in my seat.
But I'm already sitting here.

<i>And for Regina, new faces</i>
<i>would be a welcome change.</i>

Revenge is somewhat hollow.

Regina at first loves it.

Beautiful day, isn't it?

Yes, it is.

She enjoys seeing
Snow White miserable,

and she enjoys seeing
Prince Charming in a coma.

But after a while, it grows old.

Morning, Madam Mayor.
Save it.

Everyone is telling her
exactly what she wants to hear.

And she gets bored.

And the first person
to say something different

is this child.

What's this?

It's a gift for letting me sit
in your seat.

And that's what
she realizes she needs.

The way to fill the void in
her heart from casting the curse

is through a son.

The father doesn't wanna be there.

He just wants to take the boy
and go back home to New Jersey.

And ultimately, Regina won't
allow that to happen.

Sheriff, our visitors
are driving out of Storybrooke.

Find them before
they cross the town line.

<i>But the boy's father knew</i>
<i>something was wrong.</i>

Run into the woods.
Get as far away as you can. Run!

Dad!
Run!

Why are you doing this?

You wanna stay here, don't you?

Not like this.

What Regina realizes
is that if she forces this kid

to live with her, it won't be real,

and that was the whole purpose
of finding a son to begin with.

I'm sorry.

I just wanted us to be happy.

And then that boy grows up
to be Greg Mendell...

Who has been
searching for this town

for a very long time.

You could've told me who
you were and why you're here.

I... I think you know why I'm here.

I'm looking for my father.

Your father?

He left shortly after you did.

I never saw him again.

<i>After finding Neal in New York...</i>

Thank God I caught you.

What are you doing here?
Oh!

<i>Emma received some surprising news.</i>

I'm Tamara.
Emma.

She's my fiancee.

So how'd you guys meet?

For Emma, this is hard.

It's been ten years, and she's
moved on from Neal, but...

Mm-hmm.
Moving on and seeing someone else move on

are two different things.

And when she sees that Neal is
with someone else,

she is upset,

but in true Emma fashion,
won't admit it.

Does she know who you really are
and where you're really from?

Take my advice. Tell her the truth.

Neal comes clean with Tamara,

and says, "I'm from
the Enchanted Forest."

"My father's Rumplestiltskin,
and you're in Crazytown."

What the hell are you doing?

I'm trying to be honest with you.

What we learn is,

Tamara isn't everything
she's presented to Neal,

and that she is someone
who not only believes in magic,

knows about it,
has sought it out in the past.

<i>After steering Neal away from Emma,</i>

<i>August spent the next ten years</i>
<i>indulging himself</i>

<i>and neglecting his responsibilities.</i>

8:15...

when Emma came to Storybrooke
and that clock moved.

He felt it a world away in Phuket.

And he started to turn to wood,

because it was a reminder
that he failed at his mission

and that he has failed as a person.

The Blue Fairy told him to be
selfless, brave, and true,

and he was anything but that.

You're turning to wood...

Pinocchio.

August heard of a man
who went by "The Dragon,"

who supposedly could cure any ailment.

$10,000 American dollars,

and you shall <i>never</i> turn to wood again.

<i>It was then that August met Tamara,</i>

<i>who also sought The Dragon.</i>

So what brought you to him?

Cancer.

A very rare form.

Oh.

Sorry. I'll be right back.
Will you watch this?

Yeah.

He was so desperate

that he was
willing to steal from somebody

who he thought at the time had cancer

to get what he wanted.

Stop! That's mine.

I'm so sorry.

Hey!

Uhh!

Whatever it is you have...
You deserve your fate.

<i>In truth, Tamara had no need</i>
<i>for the potion,</i>

<i>but still, she was eager to possess it.</i>

She is not sick.

She is actually after
the magical abilities

this man has. Now that I have it,

I can't risk anyone else finding you.

And then we realize for reasons
that have yet to be explored,

Tamara is really, really
interested in the magic

that's going on in Storybrooke.

Anyone in here?

<i>With no cure for his condition...</i>

Just me.

<i>August retreated to Storybrooke</i>
<i>and went into hiding.</i>

August?

August feels like he wasted his life.

This is my own punishment.
I did this to myself.

August, I'm so sorry.

I know. But you don't have to hide.

There are people in Storybrooke
who care about you.

But maybe some things
you just don't come back from.

<i>The last person August expected</i>
<i>to see was Tamara.</i>

Long time.

<i>And when he learned of her plan,</i>

<i>he was given an opportunity for redemption.</i>

Emma, it's August.

August.
Listen to me.

I have to warn you.

August?

I know what you did to The Dragon,

and you are not going to
harm anyone here.

I'm going to warn them.

No, you're not.

August makes the right choice,

and he finally is selfless,
brave, and truthful.

August!
He warns Emma and everybody at the risk

of his own life, and because of that,

he gets a second chance
at his life again.

Father?
Pinocchio.

I'm a real boy. I'm a real boy!

The Blue Fairy gives him
what he's earned,

which is another go.

Do better this time, Pinocchio.

These characters all seem
to be connected by love.

The search for love, the loss of love,

the restoration of love.

Each character, you realize,
is looking for

their own happy ending.

<i>Magic...</i>

<i>Both light...</i>

<i>And dark...</i>

<i>Is a powerful force.</i>

<i>And it's finally arrived...</i>

<i>In Storybrooke, Maine.</i>

<i>But for those who
dare to harness its power...</i>

Hey, why haven't you called
me back? Where are you?

<i>Be careful,</i>

<i>for magic always comes...</i>

Right here.
<i>- With a price.</i>

Sorry I'm late.
It's been a heck of a day.
