It's time.

Pillow fight!

Go to bed.

Turn the lights off. 

Come on, hurry!

Hey, give me the pillow!
 - But what do you want...

It's dark, but I'm not afraid.

What's this noise ...

It's the coward ...

There's nothing to fear. I'm almost there.

Here we go again.

You'll end up being caught, Tim!
 
Hello, Adhara.

Listen all. Bobby peed in bed.

Shut up!

I'm missing a sock! Who's got it?

Who would want your old smellu sock,

 - Yesterday it was here.

Hey, that's mine!

It's taken.

Let's go...The TV!

Ten points!

I found you!

It's mine. Give it to me!

One, two, three.

Hey, pass it - Here!

That's Tim, don't count on him.

Oh, no! Look what he did, idiot!

Sorry!

Now you've blown it....

Go get the ball, quickly!
 - That's what I'm trying to...

-It's in the basement.
 -I'm not going there.

The ball is in the basement? Now what do we do?

-Who's gonna go get it now?
 -The one who threw it there should go bring it back.

Go, coward!

I can't, it's very dark!

Go, I can see it from here!

You'd better come back with the ball 
 or you'll get into trouble.

Don't dare coming back without it!

Let's see how he gets it...

Where is it?

Who took it?

Give me back the window knob!

It's not funny.

What is it? You scared of the dark?

Finally.

Where are you, Adhara? From here...

I don't see you.

Let's see...

Here is the North Star.

A bit lower, the Ursa Minor.

Pegasus gallops next to the Unicorn..

The Dragon runs from Perseus...

and between Orion and the Two Dogs ...

the Wolf...

It should be right...here!

Hello, Adhara!

What is it?

It's impossible!

You see? It's not a yellow bat.

It's a child.
Are you for real?

A very rude child.

I'm sorry. Thank...

Thank you very much for saving me!

Calm down! Listen, the stars...

Let's see...Which one of you is responsible
 for this child?

Ah... Tobermory.
 I should have guessed.

Why is this child still awake?
 You were taking another nap!

Can't you do your job well at least once? 
 - Why are you talking to the cats?

Why don't you ask me?
 - And who are you?

I am ... I'm Tim.

And you...? Who are you?

Are all these your cats?

Why would you think they call me
 the Cat herder?

Tobermory, make him sleep. 
 And you, be a good boy and go to bed.

That's what I was trying to explain to you!

I can't go to bed because
  the window does not open

that's why I climbet up here and discovered a star was missing.

And now I can't go to sleep!

What did you say, what is missing?

My star!

Look, look here.

This is my star, Adhara.

Now look at it. 

You see? It's not there.

I can solve the problem.
 - Really?

That's it. And now go to bed!

I can't go to bed until my star returns.

Another one just disappeared!
 Aren't we going to do anything?

We? I'm sorry. This is the responsibility of Mr. Moka.

Moka? Who is Moka?

He knows the stars? 
 - You little stubborn and annoying one...

It's the boss, the boss, the big fish
that directs Nocturna.

Nocturna? What is Nocturna?

Don't you realize that I am a very busy person?

It's not easy to be the Cat herder.
 I have many responsibilities.

I have to tell this to Moka, about the stars gone missing.

Impossible, Moka never receives visitors. 
 - Me yes, he will receive me!

He's too important!

This cat ...

I'll give you a last chance, Tobermory.

If you can't do your job, you'll leave the herd.

Make him fall asleep!

You starting to feel sleepy?

What an annoying and loud cat...

Not even a little?

It's another star gone!
 - Come on, concentrate on his meowing.

You need to be closer.

Why do you want me to go to sleep?
 - Because when the children are awake,

they are noisy, mischievous, annoying, 

unpredictable, quarrelsome,
 restless and naughty.

Whilst when the children are asleep...

they are perfect. 
That's what you think. But I have to see Moka.

There are several ways to make
 a child go to bed ....

I'm sorry.

This kid is driving me crazy.

What do you say if I take you in the office of
 Mr. Moka and then go to sleep?

Agreed.

Well, then mount up and hold on tight.

You wanna wake up the whole city?!
 Stop shouting!

And don't scratch my back!

Ah, children...

Here we are, the headquarters of Nocturna.

You can't wait a moment?

We must hurry, I must warn Moka!

Calm down, kid.

You all wait out here.
 You too, Tobermory.

It's about time you learned to behave.

Stay behind me.
 - An hour!

an hour late!

Relax, grandpa, don't worry, it's just coffee.
 - 'Mr.' Grandpa for you, young man.

Moka is waiting and is losing his patience.

Take it to his office, now!

We must deliver it to Moka? 
 The last time we did it...

we almost lost our heads.
Well, try to learn to be on time

and nothing bad will happen to you!

All right, Grandpa.
 Don't panic like this.

The delivery note? 
 You must sign the delivery note!

Little delinquents. 

What brings you here all of a sudden?

The child wants to see Moka and I couldn't
 convince his tough pumpkin

that Moka doesn't receive anyone.
 I should have sent him to sleep, but ...

Who are you talking about?

I'm talking about him.

But where...?

You know what? Maybe I should take it easy.

Working too much, Grandpa.

I'll ask for a holiday.
 This is what I'll do.

Wait! I need to find Moka!

Where is the brat now?

Pay attention.
 - Excuse me.

It's my first important job, 
 I can't be late.

What can I say, I think beginners are really cute.

Look, here's one.

Tell me if he doesn't look adorable.

Beware, they serve more crickets in section three.

Come on, guys! Let's give a little rhythm to the night!

I don't know what's happening, but this
 sounds nothing like a grasshopper.

We have a lot of dry grass out there.

You'd have to climb at twenty-one.

Give me another. 
 - Enough!

Get some for the gardens!

One more in the street.
 - Are you sure? It's the second round.

I said fill it!
 I know my limits.

Look where you're going. Watch out!

Last call for sharing dreams.

"...and then, without knowing how,

you find yourself in the middle of
the classroom ... in your underwear."

What kind of dream is this?

It has no style! The prose is vulgar and superficial!

Okay. I accept it just because we need to print

and we need  the material. Otherwise...

I thought it was interesting.

You have to push, not throw.

You just have to push it to the edge.

Until there's only one leg or arm hanging ... 
 Try it again.

Wait I'm coming with you!
 - It's full.

Closed.

You can't enter here without permission. 
 It's not right.

And the doorman told me that Moka 
 didn't receive anyone today. He's very busy.

He will receive me. My problems are very important.

Excuse me, could you tell me where I can find Moka?

Who allowed you in?
 Unauthorized people.

Relax. He's not dangerous. 
 He found...

Security. There's an intruder in the building.

Security? Security!

He said that if it was not for me ...

Security alert! Unauthorized people in the building

Don't move.

Why did you call the security? Was it necessary?

I was going to take him away immediately, and only ...

That's why I don't like this place. 
 - Follow us, sir.

But...

I'm not the intruder! It's this stubborn child.

No, not again!

We'll keep an eye on the fat.
 He could do something.

I don't want to go in there.

Moka will have a heart attack.
 Remember last time?

The more time you stay in, the worse it gets.

What do you mean by "the more in"...?
 You come with me.

Me?

Why sacrifice both?
 You go alone.

Excuse me, can you tell me
 where can I find Moka?

Good luck, kid.

It's time. The coffee pot is empty.
 - What?

Put the coffee beans inside.

But I ... 
 - Move! It's more than an hour that I didn't drink.

Are you Moka, the boss who rules over Nocturna?

Well, well. Look what we have here? A child.

Tell me, why are you here?
 - I have to talk to you.

Talk? No, no, no.
 I'm too busy.

Too busy.

But it's very important!

Let's see...

Meeting with the bats union, meeting of contents...

You're lucky, I have a gap.
 Two minutes!

So...want to talk or
 you prefer to lose two minutes?

The night ends at six o'clock on the dot, kid.

Well, you see, Mr. Moka.
 It's about the stars.

Stars?

Didn't you lose a sock or mess up the sheets?

It's my star, but not only mine, because...

You're just a child. What do you have to do with stars?

Shouldn't you be in bed?

That's the whole problem!

I can't go to sleep because my star disappeared..

And I heard that you are in charge here.
 - Exactly. A very important work.

You have no idea: roll the sheets,

spread the feathers... make the eyes bleary, for example.

Listen.

Do you remember ever waking up without your hair in a mess?

Or not hearing the wood floor creaking at night?

You should give thanks to them:

the faithful and devoted 
 workers of the night.

All must work in harmony,
 otherwise it would all be ruined.

And what would happen then?
 - I don't know.

And you don't want to know.
 It would give you goose bumps.

But it is very important that the stars don't disappear.

You must do something!

'I' must?

You're telling me what to do?

I am the great master supervisor
 and a child comes and tells me what to do.

I don't understand. I have employees

who take care of small things. 
 - Small things?

You mean there are others dealing with the stars?

Of course, genius.
 The Star Keeper.

He's not doing a good job.

He already lost three stars, probably more.

And I'm the only one to sound the alarm.
 - I gave you my precious time

and you're telling me I'm not doing a good job.

Did you see a child over here?

No. Because children don't solve problems.

The children only eat chocolate, break things and cry or whine.

I'm sorry. I don't ...
 It's not what I meant, but ...

Just look at the sky and you see it!

We must warn the Star Keeper!

No one will be warned and you know why?

Because during my night no error occurs.

But I...

You already made me lose too much time.

Make sure you sign out.

So much coffee can't be good.

And now, what?

They swallowed the bait, boss.
 - Excellent job, Mr. Pei.

Now we just have to wait.

How could they do this to me?!
 Throw me in the tower...

What a humiliation!

And all thanks to you, Tobermory.
 What's wrong with you?

Instead of making him sleep, you sleep!

And now your child has disappeared in the Tower of Moka.

Why can't you be like the other cats?

Hello, Cat herder!

There you are!

So, I guess they threw you out before you got to see Moka?
 - No.

I saw him.

Ah...well...Remember our agreement?

If I were to bring you to Moka, you'd go to bed.

But I can't!

I must do what Moka said.

And what did he say?

To find the Star Keeper

and tell him about the missing stars.

Moka told you this?

Yes.

I think I'll go and ask Moka about what you said.

It's not a good idea!

Why?

He has a lot to do now.

And he told me that he didn't want to be disturbed.

No worries, I'm sure he'll receive me.

Look what he gave me.
 The address of the Star Keeper.

What is this?

Gee?! An official document...
 It seems to be real.

It's in the lighthouse.

Wait wait wait a second!

Do you know how far it is?

It will take all night to get there
 and that means ...

I can't afford such a thing on my record.

OK. I'll take you to the Star Keeper.

But then you go straight to bed.

After all, there is only one thing left to do tonight.

Which thing? 
 - Make sure you sleep!

Quick. The night ends at six.
 There's no time to lose.

"you try to cover it
  the best way you can

but the other children are laughing at you 
 whilst the teacher ...."

They write such short dreams today.

Absolutely perfect.

So many cats! Will they follow us all the way?

This proves how little you know...

Each child has a cat assigned that will guard him or her 
 through the night from outside,

keeping them asleep with their meows.

It's a big responsibility.

So...Mine is Tobermory?

Yes, a comatose cat and an insomniac child. Perfect match. 

Watch this. Isn't it beautiful?

I don't like the night too much.
 - What? You can't mean it.

It's dark, sad and scary.
 I don't like it at all!

But it's full of wonderful things!

The only good thing about the night are
 the stars. And now they're disappearing.

Ah, this is the weirdest, most annoying kid... 
 - Silence!

We are trying to play music here!
 What a lack of respect!

What is it?

It's a whisperer.

Do you think that things just happen
 by accident at night?

Pay attention.

Look at that one ... How unprofessional.

But what ...? I can't believe it!

What's going on?

The Cat herder is with Tim.
 What could they possibly be doing together?

This was not in the plan.
 It could ruin everything.

Separate him from the Cat herder immediately!

What? You wanna do "that"?

-Do "that"? Don't even think about it! We don't need 
 anything so extreme for the moment.


Ok... I'll be there before you can say psss...

-It wasn't bad.
What a night! I'm exhausted.

See you, Jimmy. You've been great tonight. Well done!

Well done ... for a beginner.

How insensitive! Sleeping during one of
 my best concerts!

Wake up, you filthy beast!

So what do you say now about the night?
 Do you still think it's sad?

To be honest, I'd say it's getting even darker.

We must hurry.
 - Sure, sure. Come on, guys, let's go.

What's going on?

Why are they abandoning the herd?

What's happening to you?

What are they looking at?

What is ... that?

I don't know.

No! 
 - What?

It is too dark there.
 I need light.

Please!

Okay, okay, calm down.

Look there. It's a good place.

Here you'll be fine. Wait for me.

But ... 
 - Relax.

I only go to warn the herd.
 Tobermory will stay with you.

It'll take a second.

Thanks, Tobermory.

How terrible. Look at her.
 Not a single hair is tangled.

She must have brushed it hundreds of times.

What can we do?

How about giving her a prehistoric-style?

Knots. I'd say knots.

It's a challenge, girls.
 But I know we can do it.

At work!

No. Too conventional.

No, no. It has no character.

More knots, more knots!

No, now it has no charm.

It's not our style.

I told you, knots.

It does have class!
 - Well, girls. We totally did it!

The knots will always work.

A child! - And he's awake.

He has seen too much.

Tobermory, help! 
Look at that!

Shall we do something about it?
 - Absolutely.

You must watch out, be alert. 
 And don't get yourself in trouble.

Very strange things are happening tonight.

I'm counting on you.

Don't move, we can't  concentrate. 
 - You're tickling me.

If you stand still, we will turn you into
 a masterpiece of modern art.

Tonight there is no time for art. 
 We have an important mission.

Let's go, Tim.

This is our work area.

He belongs to us...It is intended to be our...

Leave him!
 - Our masterpiece.

They think I should change my image. 
 - Not tonight.

I'm sorry. Maybe we will meet again.

Someday we will meet again for sure!

-And then... we will do wonders with that hair!

herder, what was that?

The hair entanglers. Sometimes they get on my nerves.

You know what I mean.

I know. But I'm sure it has nothing to do with Nocturna.

You think we're in danger?

In danger? Moka makes sure that everything is in order.

We shouldn't worry.
 - Sure... Moka.

There they are.

Okay, my little ones.
 You know what you have to do.

Quickly! And your uncle Pei will be proud of you.

How do you know where to go?
 -You always worry too much.

I can go through Nocturna with eyes closed.

But I don't understand why
 there is so much fog tonight..

Watch out!

Tobermory, are you alright?

Cat herder?

Cat herder?

Hello?!

It's... it's a star!

Wait, I won't hurt you!

I got it!

It's the kidnapper! Catch him before he escapes!

Kidnapper! 

Kidnapper! ... Kidnapper! ...
 - I am not the...

Thglowis time he can't escape.
 We have surrounded him.


Star, what is going on?
 - Star!

Why are you calling me 'star',
 you petty criminal?

I'll show you what a star is.

No! 
Stop that kid!

He put Murray off. Get him!

Run, Tobermory!

What happened...? The kid!

Tim! Where is he?

Lights?

I'm not a kidnapper, I am Tim!

Wait for me, boy!

The party has begun!

Stand still. You can't pass unpunished.

One moment.

I told you not to move!

Good cat. Too bad the herder isn't here.

A watermelon?

Here!

Kidnapper! Kidnapper!...

Kidnapper. We have to spray him.

I did not mean to...
 - He broke the filament!

For Murray!

Get away from him!

Nebulae, diverse this fog!

Cat herder, you came to save me!

I can't leave you out here
 awake throughout the night.

It would look bad on my record.

-It's not the kidnapper.
 -It's the boy!

Tell me, what's going on?

Why do you chase this child?
We thought it was the kidnapper.

Kidnapper, kidnapper...

Many of us are gone without a trace.

That's why Murray offered himself as bait

to try and catch the criminal in the act.

And he did it again ...

'It takes more than a blow to put me off...'

Murray! 
 - Hooray!

Back, back.
 Don't stay in front of the champion!

I'm sorry. I didn't want to drop you ...

I thought you were a star that fell from the sky.

Understandable confusion.

We should always be in the lampposts and traffic lights, but ......

things were getting too bad, so we had to take action.

You started to disappear like the stars?

Yes.

We're losing the sparkle.

-I don't find it funny.
 -Sorry, champ.

I could have sworn it was the kidnapper.
 But if you say he's not, then...

Moka sent the boy to find out what's happening...

That's why we can't stay any longer, we gotta go.

-Good luck!
 -I'm sorry I broke you.

No worries. My mother always told me that one day 
 I would break my head.

See you, guys!
 - Goodbye!

I said ... wait!

Night report:
we are overwhelmed.

Half of the city is in the dark
 and nobody knows why.

Increasing complaints from trade unions

and many accidents because of poor visibility

The streets are not safe, 
the crickets want to strike

and those who normally make others sleep... 
 have abanonned the asleep ones.

Pardon me, sir.

Everyone is asking
 a lot of questions

about light and ... about this shadow.

What?...

Sorry!

Questions, questions.
 And who answers my questions?

I'm here! Done.

So?

Finished, boss. Perfect.

That's... wonderful.
 It could not get any better.

Guess who will soon have a ...

A raise, a raise, boss?

A problem... 
 - What?

...with the Cat herder!
 - How did you do it?

I never thought of
 having to do that "thing".

It's time ... 
 - Do you really want me to do that "thing"?

Yes.

And remember. If it fails, it
 may be too late.

It's enough for today.

Let's go down, guys.

This is the entrance to the harbor.

Soon we reach the lighthouse.

Look, how many stars
 and lights are gone.

And it's very dark. 
You were right. Something is happening.

Forgive me for not believing you.
 - What happens if all the stars disappear?

This can't happen.
 It's impossible. If there were no stars ...

What would happen?
 - I think ... Nocturna would disappear.

And what will happen with you,
 with your cats, with Moka

and with the hair entanglers?
We are part of Nocturna.

But... You can't disappear.
 I don't wanna be alone again.

But what are you saying, now you worry about us?
 I thought you didn't like the night.

Anyway, I promise I won't disappear.

Not while there are still weird children 
 they don't want to go to bed.

Don't worry. We will restore
 the stars in their place.

It seems that they are very important for you. 
Of course they are.

Mom told me once that all of us have one.

Just pick one
 then look at the sky

and see how it shines.

You'll never feel lonely at night,
 because your star is with you,

protecting you from the darkness.

She told me she would always be here,
 but now... not anymore.

Don't worry. I will not leave 
 you alone. I promise.

The stars will shine again
 before dawn comes.

We are a good team, right?
 - Do you mean ... you and me?

Sure! You saw how we ran
 faster than the lights

and how we managed to
 stop them? True, Tobermory?

I don't know why I keep trying.
 It's useless.

Come, let's go!

Coming, herder!

Thanks for saving me.
 - We are a team, right?

Yes, yes, more or less...

This way.

There we are! The bridge connects
 the pier to the lighthouse.

We'll be there in a moment.

We did it! - Almost.

I begin to understand why Moka
 picked you for this mission.

I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

Well, Cat herder...
 I just wanted to tell you that ...

What's happening?

Another time. Please.

All your cats!

What are you doing here?

You should have stayed in town.
 I told you it was dangerous.

Why have you followed us?
 Why are you so nervous?

Try to calm down. Calm down!

Silence!

There...

there are children crying.

They're all awake.

This is why the cats came
 looking for us.

But why...?

All the children are awake. I don't know what
 is happening. I must go back.

You're going? 
This is not normal, I have to fix it.

But you can't leave me now.
 We are very close.

Don't you understand? It's my job.

What will Moka think of me if I leave
 the children up all night?

You only care about your job and
 what Moka might think.

He didn't even listen to me
 when I tried to tell him about the stars.

So... what about the card...?
He didn't give it to you himself, did he?

We are here without his permission.

You lied to me, Tim.
 - He would not listen to me.

You've seen all the stars,
 the lights and the shadow.

Who knows what would have happened later.

Stay here, you can't come with me
But you said you would't leave me alone.

This was a lie too.

I'll return to you soon,
 but when I finish

this time I'll take you where
 you should have stayed and sleep.

We won't remain here waiting
 while the stars are disappearing.

We don't need anyone,
 we don't need anyone.

You two - there!

The others - follow me!!

There's no time to lose.
You there, on that balcony.

Let's go, Tobermory.

Don't be so lazy.

It seems there's no one...

Star Keeper?

Star Keeper!

Star kee...

You will not believe this, but I think
 I saw someone up there ..

yes, sure, Ted...

You two stay at your place.

I think everything is under control.

What are you doing here, girls?
 Any problems?

Problem? We couldn't mess up anyone's hair
 properly.

All the children have gone mad.
Because of that worm.

Calm down, tell me,
 who are you talking about?

Who? Who else? Pei!

He has awakened them all. 
 - I want to wipe that smile off his face.

Pei? For what reason?

I think I should tell Moka
 of all this.

Star Keeper?
Star Keeper!

Star Keeper?
Who's there?

Finally, someone came.
 I was starting to despair.

You...are... 
 - A star.

You are beautiful. 
 - Thank you.

Many only look at my position.
 - And what is your position?

I am the North Star, of course.

The whole world revolves around
 me. I'm not bragging.

It's the truth. 
 - I know.

I watch you every night.
You keep me company.

Especially Adhara. It's my star.
 But it suddenly disappeared.

Impossible. The stars will not disappear.

We are here for thousands of years.

I think there's a blackout. We must
 use the emergency switches.

Emergency switch?
All the stars have one.

I don't get there. But here behind
 I have my emergency switch.

Do you see it?

We must tell the Star Keeper,
 how to make all the stars shine again.

What Keeper?

You know. The one who takes care
 of all the stars

and makes sure that all
 have what they need.

I'm here for millennia, child. 
 Trust me,

there are no people here.
But...

Then, who lives in the lighthouse?

No one. You're the first person
 I see here in the lighthouse for centuries.

Now everything is automatic.

But Moka said ... 
 Did I come this far for nothing?

Who will save the stars?

How about you? 
I?

Just go to the bridge and turn
 on the stars that don't shine.

You could be the Star Keeper.

Don't you want to make them shine again?

Comrades!

We are the last
 light survivors.

We must remain united
 against the enemy.

The kidnapper. - The kidnapper!

Kidnapper, kidnapper...
Cursed filament.

Kidnapper!

I don't understand. The switch
 doesn't work. What's happening?

I don't know. But...

if you din't manage to make it shine again 
 it means...

they are dead.

No. No. It can't be...

Adhara.

No!

Emergency call,
 for all on Nocturna ...

Nocturnians, you have to go
 the tower immediately

Immediately! No one should
 stay out here!

No one!

Warning! Protect yourself from the shadow! ...

Mr. Moka, thank you
 for receiving me.

We must do something.
 Pei has ... What are you doing here?

Leave us alone, Pei. We have
 a lot to talk about. Coffee?

I would prefer an explanation.

Adhara. You can't leave me alone.
 You are my star.

You must protect me.

You must remain with me forever.

Tim, what do we do now?

Moka lied to me.
 I must go back.

Are you sure? 
 - I am now, yes.

Moka knew everything. From the very beginning.

What is this?

Tim, what's happening...what's happening?

Quick!

Let's get out of here!

He's destroying everything.
 It's terrible.

The shadow is growing. And it is more
 dangerous than I thought.

When the last light turn off completely 
 it will be the end of Nocturna.

We must stop it! 
 - Stop it?

It's too late. Don't you understand
 that this must have been done by the child?

Maybe it is so, but I must find him.

I promised not to leave him alone.

Where do you think you're going?
 - I will not be sitting here.

It's not my style.

Good luck, buddy.

Hey, big boy!

I'm here!

Murray? You're still standing!

Of course. I am a low-energy light.

You're not going to the meeting?

I can't. I must find the child,
 and protect him from the shadow.

From the shadow? Please let me come with you.

I have a score to settle
 with that worm.

No, buddy. It's too dangerous.
 - Trust me ...

An angry light
 doesn't know the word "danger".

Look! There's the tower of Moka.
 - We did it!

But how do we go down there?
We can't fly.

Says who?

What's happening?

We can't work without the stars.

There's hardly any light.
 What's next?

We want an explanation!
We want an explanation!

Moka is coming.

Be quiet! 
How can we be silent?

The shadow is destroying all
 Nocturna. Moka owes us an explanation.

Nocturnians.

As you know, we are going
 through a difficult period.

And you would like to know who
 is causing all this.

You all deserve to know
 who is responsible

for this disaster, this chaos, 
 for this tragedy.

And then question is
 who sent the shadow

to destroy our night.

And I'll tell you.

The person who has caused all this
 is a child called

Tim. 
This is not true.

Tim? 
It's a lie.

The child? 
Can't be. It's impossible!

The child has brought
 his shadow in Nocturna.

But he is not the one responsible
 for the disaster we are going through.

We must not forget that for some
 who sleep this and is a place to fear.

The nightmares, the monsters under the bed

the abominable things lurking
 in dark corners. The shadows ..

This is how the night is for Tim.

His fear has created this
 monster that now threatens us

erasing any trace of light and
 whatever it wants.

We must do something!

No! There's only one way
 to defeat the shadow.

And only one person could do it.

He must overcome his fear
 to face the shadow.

And he must find the courage 
 to do it alone.

No one should interfere.

I wanted Tim to travel
 alone to Nocturna.

But I have failed, I'm sorry.

Eclipse, eclipse!

It's eating the moon!

Look!

It's too late.

Tim is in danger.

Easy, big guy.
 Sure the boy is OK.

Look there! It's another survivor!

It's eating everything.

All the stars, the lights ...
 And now the moon..

All the light.
 You're the last star.

And if you disappear ...

Do you think that 
 I brought the shadow?

I believe in you, Tim.

You wouldn't do this.
 You care about us.

Cat herder!

It's Tim! 
I told you.  I knew he was fine.

herder! herder!

This child is a survivor, 
 like me ...

It's going towards Tim.

Cat herder, it's me!...

I hope you have a plan.
 - Now we'll see.

I don't think it's the best plan.

Look at this delicious piece of light,
 little that's left of it. 

We did it!
 He has forgotten the star.

Maybe it's time
 we worried about us.

Where did it go?

It's right behind us!
 Run! Run!

Okay, come on.

Come, go ahead, get me, I'm waiting.
 Come on, don't be shy.

Come on, let's go!

Come on. Don't pull
 back now.

Come!

Hey you, worm!!

Get back here! Don't go away!

Don't you see how appetizing I am?

So sorry, I failed.

There's no time now to complain.

Listen, we have to hide,
 we must find a safe place

where the shadow won't 
 even think to look for us.

There is no such place.

Not anymore.

Now where do you think you're going?
Don't even dare ...

Tim, don't be afraid.

He needs you! 
 - I can't...

Trust me.

You must....confront it.

You gotta do something!

You have to face it!

herder!

Here, you monster! Face one of your size!

Cat herder, you'll be fine. 
 I know you'll be fine.

I am so sorry, I didn't come to help you.

You can still do it. You're the only one who can save Nocturna.

What?

Look at me. I can't do it all alone.

I'm scared.
What are you afraid of?

Now you know Nocturna.

You never see us, but we're always here.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

Those who love you will never leave you. 
 You always carry them with you.

Even when they are no more.

No!

Don't leave me!

Cat herder...
Cat herder...

We must go away from here.

What are you doing? Run!
 - There's nowhere to run to.

Is this what you want?

If I have no fear, you can't exist!

North Star?

I hope this works.

Are you ok? 
 - I'm...

I'm shining. 
 - How beautiful...

Tim, are you alright? 
 - Yes.

He's gone.
 But he'll always be with me.

What a trip!

Tobermory, Murray!

Thank you for your help, my friends.

Look at the sky!
 We did ??it!

Come on, guys. 
 - Time for work.

How was your night, champ?

Quite busy. That shadow caused
 some problems, but in the end ...

Yes, sure, sure. 

Now everything is back in its place.
 - Almost.

Your place is up there...

Thank you for saving me,
 for saving us all...

It was great being with you.
 Please say hello to Adhara.

And tell thanks for
 being there every night.

Goodbye!
 - I'll be watching you!

I know, I know, time to sleep now.

You have been a perfect guardian.

I'm sure the Cat herder would be very proud of you.

I just want to thank everyone.

It's been a very long and heavy night.
 We deserve a good rest day.

Come on!
 - Pass it on, pass it!

It's Tim. 
 - It's not possible.

He's got the ball!
