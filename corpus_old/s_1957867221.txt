(mouse clicking)

Durga temple, home of an ancient sect

of warrior monks, militant renegades,

who claim to have defended society

throughout history from

the malevolence evil presence, born

of fire and hatred, known as the Gin.

The Durga's eccentric leader,

the grand Zel, dispatches platoons

of his zealous followers around the world.

Their mission, to extinguish

the Gin's power of possession

and to finally locate
the reincarnated soul

of their fierce goddess,

the eternal Ecajetty.

Zel tirelessly searches the astral realm

for a sign that he himself
must enter the battle.

(eerie music)

Look.

(birds chirping)

(Stacey laughing)

Dinner's almost ready.

Okay, mom.

Oh, can Gina stay over?

Sure, but make sure you call her mom.

Okay Mom.

My mom's working till midnight anyway.

Yo, did you hear about those kids

in San Diego who found a body

in the trunk of an abandoned car?

They were using this new Epifanati app.

Oh, really?

(birds chirping)

This isn't real.

I don't believe you, you're a liar.

I'm not a liar.

I already downloaded it anyway.

(birds chirping)

Wanna do it?

Not really.

Well, we're doing it.

Okay, to start it says you

just have to pick your distance.

But what?

How far? You decide.

It says 1,000 meters or 5,000 meters.

How far is that?

I don't know, it's like European.

Okay, fine 1,000.

1,000, now it says to close your eyes

and think of an objective.

What?

(birds chirping)

Like (sighing) imagine what

you wanna experience, okay?

(eerie music)

Death.
Gina, are you crazy?


Gina, change your objection right now.

Too late, see it's already searching

for a location.

(Stacey sighing)

Hey, you should go live right now.

No.

Come on, do it.

Okay, fine, okay.

(birds chirping)

Hey, all my cool cats and kittens.

I'm here with my girl, Gina.

And we're about to try this new epif...

Epifanati.

Epifanati app, and Gina picked death

as a fricking objective, and now,

we have to walk around and focus

on death, great.

(eerie music)

Yo, it says that the
location's already here.

(eerie music)

It's in your backyard.

This has been such a great adventure.

You've taken me to my backyard

that we're already in.

I mean, look, the flowers back there

are definitely dead.
Stacey?

This bush is definitely dead

and this ball is definitely dead.

(eerie music)
(growling sound effects)

(fire crackling and crickets stridulating)

Gina?

(eerie music)

Gina, this isn't funny.

(crickets stridulating)

Gina?

(eerie music)
Gina, you're scaring me!

(growling sound effects and screaming)

(crickets stridulating)

Sweetie?

(Stacey screaming)

(eerie music)

shaky business future

here in the US, apps like TikTok

and Triller have gained a strong foothold

in the entertainment industry.

The new app on the block, Claktion, claims

to set itself apart from

its competitors, offering tools

for aspiring filmmakers and storytellers.

Ahead of the app's official release,

Claktion hosted what it called

a content creator's camp, slated to be

a week long event led
by popular influencer

and local celebrity, Chaz Bruce,

whose dance videos

and comedic creations dubbed #brucegang

have garnered millions of fans.

A small group of willing creators

were selected to come to our city

and learn the finer points of making

and distributing digital content,

all in hopes of gaining
followers and fame.


by the campers?


Damn.

(static buzzing)

Hopefully Zel can put this right.

Praise Ecajutty.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(clapper clapping)

(upbeat music)

(clapper clapping)

What's going on creators?

Look, my name is Chaz Bruce.

I'm really excited to be one

of the first brand ambassadors

for the Claktion app.

(clapper clapping)

(upbeat music)

(clapper clapping)

â™ª Now this is a story â™ª

â™ª All about how my life's been messed up â™ª

â™ª Since the shutdown â™ª

â™ª And I'd like to take a minute â™ª

â™ª Just sit right there â™ª

â™ª I'll tell you all that I've been doing â™ª

â™ª Since I can't go nowhere â™ª

â™ª I always take my horse â™ª

â™ª Down to McDonald's â™ª

â™ª And let 'em buy till â™ª

â™ª They can't no more â™ª

(air whooshing)

What's up, what's up, Claktion people?

Me and Dash just got up here checking out

the campsite where we
gonna have the campers at.

Aye, aye.

Aye, aye, aye.
These are protective masks

we gonna be wearing,

I got on my protective mask.

As you can see Dash don't got on his.


to do all of this mask thing, man,

every day, 24 hours.

It's about protection,
you know what I mean?


sing, dance with a mask on,

I dunno if I'm gonna do that.

He don't like protection.

That's how he got all them kids now,

you know what I'm saying?
(clapper clapping)

(upbeat music)

(clapper clapping)

(air whooshing)

Baby, I was sitting here thinking

about when I used to be
a substitute teacher.

So, after I take a tennis,

I get up goes on over to the DVD player.

Put it in, come back, sit down

and woo, woo, woo, woo.

I sit on something hard
and the kids just howl,

I mean, they screaming with laughter.

I get up and I look at what I sat down on

and it's a giant penis, giant penis.

Giant penis made outta tape

with the testicles and everything.

(upbeat music)

Granny loves you.


(crowd laughing and chattering)

Hey, Granny loves, love you, Granny.

(people chattering)

Are you ready for camp?

Are you really ready?
I'm ready for camp.

Yes, I am.

content is key, okay?

I got you, I got you.

(people chattering)

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Granny didn't know what to expect

when she got here, but this

is something brand new.

Yeah, that's why they say youth

is wasted on the young.

Let the journey begin,
but protection first, mm.

(airplane engine whirring)

You know my brand.

I need to do a clear reading, right?

Boop, the fool.

Why did your parents choose that name

is what I wanna know.
I dunno,

because I'm special.

Yeah, (mumbling).

All right, let's get it clacking.

Wait, bye-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(males mumbling)

Girl, can you believe I am here?

Okay, let's see what's in here.

Get out of town, girl, Claktion.

Okay, I'm gonna take this off.

Hello, my name is Nadia.

I should be chosen for this camp

because I can teach.


to love your body and to embrace

the power of the erotic,
the sacred feminine.


at a party, quick glance, smile.

Look at a friend, take a drink,

look away and bring him back.

I like your content a lot.

Thank you.

I think I've watched
just about every video.

I only seen like one,

but that one that I seen was a good one,

it was a good one.

I can't believe it.

I can't believe I'm here.

Oh, it's so beautiful.

(playful music)

I like to consider myself

an intellectual triple threat

because I'm blonde and Polish.
(audience laughing)

Oh my God, are you like obsessed

with me or something?
(audience laughing)

Thank you.


let's get it clacking.

It is getting clacking.


(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

I got a cute little
new backpack mini, no.


There was a big spider.


Oh.
Oh.

[Chaz] Malik, what's...
Oh.


an interpreter for you.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

We dunno. There we go.
Yes.


What's going on?


I asked for.

[Male] Oh.
I don't know-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

The one we had, he not here.

He'll be here later, though.

Okay, so this is...

She's like a stand in,

this is kind of like a substitute,

but you'd be good, right?

One time.
One time.

Uh! Hey, yeah!
(male laughing and clapping)

Hey guys, I'm Irene Rushing.

Welcome to my page, Lickety Split Make-Up.

This is my first video,

which is basically me playing

a song and finishing my makeup

by the time it's over.

But so, I'm gonna start with one

of my favorite songs by Kelly Clarks on,

"Behind Your Hazel Eyes".

(upbeat music)

Almost, Irene, almost.

Yes, I'm so excited!

I got you, boo.

Ooh.
I got you.

Oh, I'm so happy.
How many you want?

How many follows you want?

I want like 20K.

Say less. We gonna do that in-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Hey, hey, can somebody bring her 20K?

We gotta hit a dance.
Throw it, throw it up.

Gotta do-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Here we go.

Hey, whoa!
(female laughing)

Every whoa was no.
Yeah. (laughs)

Every whoa.
Absolutely.

It was like whoa.

One time, so I'm
really afraid of needles.

So, I decided one time to give blood.

Oh, what a glorious day.


but I know I'm gonna get so hot.

I woke up to seven nurses,

like Grey's Anatomy shot.

I'm gonna do my best to stay safe.

And I'm gonna keep my eyes open

'cause honey, one of these critters jump

up outta here,

they gonna see Granny run all around


So, what I used to get
from social media experts

is like, pick your niche and go with that.

I got started getting a lot of requests

from different schools
and principals asking me

to come to their school.

Could you come to my school,

could you come to my classroom

and it's very inspiring.

It's a different kind of thing

when you can teach outside in the world.

What's up? Welcome!

Welcome!
(group cheering)

Oh, y'all gotta come on now.

Y'all gotta-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(group cheering and clapping)

Come on now, y'all here for...

Y'all almost don't want no followers.

First day, right, we're gonna be dealing

with the persona.

Persona.

Thank you.

What's your personality like?

What do you do?

What do you like?

'Cause your followers
wanna see who you are,

you know what I mean?
Right, like I just said.

Day two.

Filming and editing tech-

Right.
Right.


and gentlemen, distracted.

(Rob chattering)
I am horrible,

but for everyone who is out there,

you're welcome, you're welcome.

Day three, right so-

Day three, marketing and publicity.

So, this is where a lot of people miss.

What other type of copy
that you're putting out

that's directing to
whatever kind of business

and is it making sense, right?

Do you wanna be like me or not?

(crowd cheering)

That's what I'm talking...


(crowd cheering)
All right.

The grand finale, listen,

we don't got you guys here for nothing.

[Chaz] Right.
After all of

that content creation, right,

we're gonna turn up.

We have special guests.

[Man] Woo!
DJ Salad.

(crowd cheering)

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

We are out of time.

Diddy's gonna bring some of his friends.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

You lie.
(people chattering)


The best content creation.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Are we going to the hotel first

and like change before we start the day?

[Female] Yeah.
Oh, no, we start right away.

We have started.

Okay, so now that we got everything out

of the way, we know how
the weekend's gonna go.

Let's head down to the field

and we're gonna get started with the-

Claktion Olympics.

Right this way.


(eerie music)

(door creaking)

(eerie music)

Oh, you got a problem, man?

Actually, yeah.

How y'all gonna arrest me for helping run

an adult summer camp?

They all signed waivers.

They knew what they was getting into.

Rob, if you want us to help you,

you're gonna need to cooperate.

Can we get you anything?

Smoke?

You know this doesn't really look good

on you, praying on all
these people like that.

Praying, I know y'all not talking

about what we charging for the camp.

Man, these people will pay anything

for some new followers,

for a little bit of clout,

for a taste of fame.

Shit, we ain't doing nothing illegal.

Oh, you think we give

a flying fuck about legalities?

Rob, (chuckles) we're not cops.

(male laughing)


How about you take off these cuffs then

and let me the fuck outta here?

Nah, you're not going anywhere until

you tell us who is behind this camp.

No one knows you're here.

So, we're gonna need you

to answer our questions, understood?

Now, who put this loathsome camp together?

Who put it together?
Chaz.

It was Chaz.

Shit, if that's all y'all wanted to know,

that's all you had to say.

You expect us to believe
that #brucegangchaz

is the one that put
this camp together, got

the specific individuals together

to unleash the prophecy
of the doom scroll?

The prophecy of what?

We know it's not Chaz.

Did someone reach out
to you from Epifanati?

(eerie music)

From the stupid app?


is a shadow corporation bent

on promoting societal
decay through the use

of social media communities.


Well, Rob, by encouraging them all

to come here and dehumanize each other

by creating this loathsome content,

you sealed their fate.

That's what it has to do with you.

So, I get all of this just

for helping people make
some stupid videos,

having a field day, making

up stupid dances and shit?

Come on, man.

(upbeat music)

Yes, let's go. Let's go, come on!

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(male laughing)

(people chattering)

(upbeat music)

Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

(female mumbling)

I cannot not believe we lose, ugh!

Granny was our good luck charm.

Oh, well we have Granny.

It's not fair! We have Granny.

That was great.

(people cheering and chattering)

[Male] Go, go go!
[Man] Go, go, go!

(people cheering and chattering)

Turn around there, go, go, go, go, yeah!

(upbeat music)

To the right first.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Right then left.

So, it's gonna like right, left.

Then we go-
Hey, can you get

a little bit away.

Your instruction and my
instruction, same time.

Well, can all just follow me since

I'm the lead, so.


but I'm the better dancer.

(eerie sound effects)

I really didn't expect for you guys

to have as much fun as you had.

(group cheering)

Someone who touched my
heart, man throughout

the Olympics and someone that I felt like

I really connected with.

I connected with y'all,

but there was someone who stand out

and come together we're
gonna be best friends.

So, that's what-

(group exclaiming and laughing)

(group cheering and clapping)

(cheering drowns out speaker)

See, right there. Yes, Alia.

Woo!
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


I can't let that bitch keep on winning.

What did she do to win?

What did she do to win?

Like what were we doing?

I mean, I want everyone
to win. I really do.

Yeah. (laughs)

But you know?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Now, it's time to kick
it in the rear gear.

For the rest of the
day right here at camp,

we're gonna now start
using the Epifanati app.


of intense archeological research

and one serendipitous moment.

We are now finally able to present

to you, Epifanati.
(triumphant music)

I wanna open up this app

and I'm gonna focus on
my objective, right?

â™ª Epifanati â™ª

Get out. (laughs)

That's what you gotta do.

You gotta make sure you have an objective

in mind, focus on that, and then,

the app is gonna give me a location.

Rob, make sure you...

I need you down there.

I need you to get everything.

Got you.

Okay, this is where

it's gonna get real nice, okay?

Woo hoo!

Nah, I need y'all to be with me, right?

I need you to get your focus right

because after I do it,
you're gonna do the same.

I'm gonna put in the distance, 50 meters.

50 meters.

Focus on my objective.

My objective is happiness.

That's something that I always push out.

I'm always happy. I'm always singing.

I'm always dancing.
Okay.

Happiness is everything,

that's what I'm trying to kick around

it all.
All right then.

There we go.

The journey has started.

(people chattering)

how long 50 meters is.



I hope it ain't no long way

'cause like Granny, ain't fixing

it be walking no home.

Make sure you capture all of that.


I don't know what no 50 meters is.


but I'm super excited about this.

I heard that it's a scary app.

Like, I don't know,

this is all about intentions and stuff.

So, I don't know, but
that's Granny right there.

Hey, Granny.

How many is 50 meters, how long is that?

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


but I'm starting feel
good (indistinct) already.


I see some shade.


(people chattering)

It's hot as hell.
I dunno if I feel it.


Oh, you do?

No, I feel hot.

It is.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


as hell, baby.
It's the sun.

It's definitely (chuckles) so hot out.

It's not hot as hell.

[Wai] Okay.
It's beautiful.

(people chattering)


The sun is just-
What a beautiful sun too.

It gives this light.

Hey.
(chuckles) Hey, what's up?

Say hey, everyone.

(Rob laughing)

Mm-hmm.


I rotate.
What?

I go back and forth.


You guys see what I'm talking about?

Yo!

on the wall. (chuckles)

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)



This is (indistinct).

This look exactly like the shell I found

in my happiest moments
was when I was in Hawaii.


And I had to stick with
me too when I walked.

And it just makes sense.

(Irene gasping)

This is the type of stuff

I'm telling you about, man.

Exactly what I'm talking about.

When you focus on happiness,

you focus on your objective,

the app will make sure somehow

that it connects with you.

And this can happen for you too, right?

Whatever your objective is,

you stay focused on it.

And then, the app will
make it happen for you.

This is like, this is perfect.

I hope you guys are as excited as I am.

[Group] Yeah!
Woo! Yeah.

(people chattering)

(trumpet sound effect)
Wow!

(group cheering)


(group cheering)

(trumpet sound effect)
(female laughing)


[Male] Do it again!
Woo!

(female laughing)

Now, it's your turn.

Now it's your turn,
focus on your objective.

(trumpet sound effect)

Woo! Woo hoo!

Okay, it's your turn

and what we're gonna
do is we're gonna leave

it to fate.

You guys are gonna come
and grab the straw.

The person with the longest
straw will go first.

Start thinking about
your objective right now.

Come on, brother.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
Don't be afraid,

don't be scared, don't be scared.



(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
It looks short.


All right, hold them up, hold them up.

Nadia, looks like you're the-

(group cheering)

You're gonna go, what do you say?

I need you to focus.
Nadia, seriously, girl

I'm not happy about this.

I wanted to go first.

The first thing you gonna have

to do is set your distance.

How far do you wanna go?


(laughs) 3,000.
What do you wanna do?


[Man] 3,000.
What is that,

like seven miles?


(people chattering)

Gives me more time to think.


and then, when you're ready,

I want you to make that announcement

to the group.

(eerie sound effects)

I want to covert everyone and all people

to worship the sun as their god.

That like that, okay.

Okay, girl, whatever

you want, honey.

I'm good, I'm game.

I want to convert everyone

and all people to worship
the sun as their god.

The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun.


(people chattering)
Yes, yes.

[Irene] Oh dear, here we go.
Okay, I'm here.


Here for a good time.
Did you say

how many meters?


shit getting real, right?


Mm, that Epifinati (chuckles) shit

is not a joke, man.


in front of me, walk

in front of him.

Looks like they got a situation.

They got a situation.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

But look, keep everything.

Record, this is when we
wanna record everything.

You understand? Don't stop.

Don't stop recording.


Do not stop recording.

I mean, I am not sure

about the whole sun god thing,

but I'm intrigued of what she'll find,

you know what I'm saying?

I mean, I do kind of like,

I don't wanna say study, but I read.

I read up on the Egyptian gods and stuff,

so I think, it's pretty
interesting, right?


of spiritual beliefs

and this isn't very interesting to me.

Like this following the sun,

I don't find that to be very interesting.

So, she wants to convert everybody.

She's using very like polarizing language

in this way.

I don't wanna be converted.

I mean, I'm good.

Here we go with the sun lady.

Well, I guess, she got a point.


I mean, I'm good.
(eerie music)

Here we go.

(eerie music)

Ugh.

Uh, oh. Shit, oh my God.

Good evening, Mr. Toshman.

You almost cracked your head

when you passed out last night,

but no worries.

We patched you up and cleaned you up.

You all right?
Ugh!

Mm.

What the fuck happened to my head?

Mm, where's the show's family?

Where's the boy that his mom gave

him to the hospital?

They wasn't even supposed to be there.

I don't even know how they got there.

They didn't make it into the camp.

So, you're saying they

just magically appeared when one

of your other influencers left?

I mean, I don't know.

I really don't know how
they got into the park.

Like Rob had a very
strict selection process.


the camp was Chaz's idea.

No, Rob called me and I brought Chaz in.

Listen, Chaz has millions of followers

and I knew if we had him there,

then more people would come,

especially Grandma Love, she loves him.

So, we put together the camp

because they told Rob if we did more,

and did a good job, that we could do more.

And it's more money like who doesn't

want to make-

Who is they?

Claktion, or the bigger company.

Ugh, like Epifanati.

So, you all work for Epifanati?

Yeah, I wrote the jingle for them.

I actually stole it from (mumbles),

but I mean, that's not why y'all are here-

People are dead.

The family? The boy died?

All of them.

What?


We did get Granny help in time,

but some of them are still missing.

woman, you liked her, huh?

Well, she liked you.

She trusted you, they all did.

What? I didn't kill
nobody. (cries softly)


this is really happening.

I can feel it.

I can feel the energy and
it's getting stronger.

I broke a nail.
(people chattering)

In fact, I didn't even break a nail,

but the woods took my nail.

(people chattering)

Well, this is another
adventure for Granny.

Oh Lord.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


have peed before we went out on this.

That's crazy, that's something

that I would fall in

without even seeing it, oh yeah.


(whispering resounding)

(eerie sound effects)

Did you just see that?


The dog that just ran passed.


Yeah, a dog.

A doll, no dog.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Where?

of them shiny hands.

playing with nobody dog.


This is strange.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

This is meant to be.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

This is all part of the plan.

My gym's closed, so I have not done

this much exercise in a long time.

(people chattering)

What is that? What is that?

(group chattering)

What is this?


we found something!

It's an onk.


the key of life, right?

Yeah.

[Irene] Yes, let's go.
Wait, who did this?

You know I'm Egyptian

and you're putting all of this.


Who did this?
You found that

because your energy
brought you to this place.

This is not something planted,

like this is yours.

That is for you.


[Male] What does it say?
We're on the right path,

it's the key to life.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Yes, we are. (chuckles)

Here, get a close up.

I'm so excited. (chuckles)
(eerie sound effects)

(people chattering)
Oh my God,

you guys are coming, right?

(people chattering)

What do we think? I'm not so sure.

(upbeat music)

I'm not so sure, girls.

(people chattering)

But I'm along for the ride

because where the (beep) am I gonna go?

(upbeat music)

I'm happy for her

'cause we've got some information that-

3,000.
A clue that

we're getting closer.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

I think, this is real good.

I'm like, man, inspired now

that she found something.

This is nice.


Yeah, it does, and it has

so much cultural relevance here.


It looks like really nice. Oh, yeah.

(people chattering)
We found something.

We found something. We found something.

(people chattering)

It's a nubis.

(people chattering)
I don't understand.

It's kinda cute.



(people chattering)


A nubis is associated with death.





(eerie music)

(eerie sound effects)


(eerie sound effects)

And you wake up laughing
at what you thought

was your grief.

How the (beep) do you die,

and then wake up laughing?

That's what the (beep)
I'm trying to figure out.

Guys, I'm leaving.

You need to come with me.

We've gotta get out quick.

What?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

[Man] No.
I'm gonna

just make sure she's okay.

One of the members just ran off.

She found an onk, a DJ onk or something.

And then, she found a
little taco bell dog,

a little chihuahua and she got scared.

Talking about somethings

was about to happen with death

and laughing in your dreams.

I don't know, man,

but these members is acting real weird.

I'm chilling.


We out here.
It's all good.

We all good.

[Chaz] Listen guys-
Right?


They always try to send

the light skinned people

to do the bullshit.
This is a part

of the whole thing.

You can't be afraid, okay?

Are y'all with me?

I'm with you.

We shall continue, yes?

Yes, sir.

I don't know what happened to Nadia.

I'm getting concerned now because

this is just too much, and we out here

in these woods and everything,

and she done disappear.

I'm worried about her.

Obviously, I'm doing great,

unphased by everything.

I think, it's really bizarre

and I think, everyone besides Granny

and I should be

a little bit more concerned about it.

I just don't know where she went.

Suddenly, just like me and Granny

are really alarmed.

I genuinely don't know what's happening

and it just sucks.

(birds chirping)

And I feel like the guys,

the other guys don't care.

It's just like, why don't you care

about where our camper, Nadia went?

Yo, yo.
Hey!


Pose.
This is crazy, right?


Uh-huh, can we have a silent moment here

'cause the thirst is real.

(people chattering)


(birds chirping)

You can see that all this graffiti here

is graffiti covering graffiti that used

to be behind.

You can see the paints got covered over.

You can't see what the other artist did,

they covered it up, man, how respectful.

Oh my God, you guys, oh my God,

it's Nadia's phone.

The witch. (laughing menacingly)

I have to go to the bathroom,

are you okay alone?

I'm looking at the art.
I'm fine by myself.

Okay, great.

Okay, I'll be back soon. Okay.

She just disappeared into thin air

and I just don't understand how in

the world she could have just disappeared

just, and just vanished.

She can't just be gone.

(people chattering)

It makes no sense. Like it makes no sense.

She's just not here.

And I'm getting honestly,

a really weird feeling about it too.


so I have to get a grip

because there's five more days, so.

(soft flute music)

(door knocking)

(male mumbling)

(door knocking)

I'm worried about her.


I'm chased by everything.

No, Nadia's already gone.

Can you back up a little more?

Got it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, can
you bring that one up?

(eerie music)




This place is a dream only

a sleeper considers it real.

But it was your thought,
it was your grief.

We've gotta get out quick.


then wake up laughing?


What's that behind there?
Guys, I'm leaving.

(eerie sound effects)

(Nadia screaming)

Death comes like dawn.

You can't be afraid.

(bell beeps)

Open this goddam door for me.

(John laughing)

(door knocking)

Hey, hey. Hey, come on.

Open the door, you dip-shits.

Uh, what's with the suits, huh?


it's an honor to once
again be in your presence,

I'm afraid your travels have been for not.

We had everything here well-

Now, listen, listen, listen.

When you speak, you're only repeating

what you think you already know,

but if you are silent,

you just might learn something new, okay?

Good, now, Granny Love

the Ecajutty is safe.

No, now she is safe.

I have sent our goddess to
begin training with her sisters.

This place is not safe.

(Eastern music)

Look gentlemen, you must understand

that we, the Durga, must combine

the power of thunder with the strength

of diamond to defeat our foe, the Gin.

You must remain vigilant, you dip-shits.

These damn spirits who serve

your god can take any form, travel swiftly

on the wind, and possess the minds

of the innocent and ignorant in order

to command them to do
acts of unspeakable evil.

Yes, usually their actions are relegated

to juvenile pranks, but it appears

this son of a has developed

a taste for murder and suicide.

(Eastern music)


(Eastern music)

It appears that one who's been touched by

this evil is in our midst.

He must be confronted.

With all due respect, Zel,

the little one, Toshman,

we believe him to be pure of heart

and worthy of our mercy.

He is to join our ranks.

I have summoned the bull

to administer his cleansing.

(Eastern music)

But it appears the real problem, (laughs)

Which both of you have lost sight of,


(Eastern music)

Surprised? (laughs) Pathetic.


You guys, that's the Schultz family.

(horn honking)

Hey, what's up?

We're the Schultz, I'm Mike.

I'm Christina.

And I'm Tyler.

I prank my parents all the time.

And it sucks sorta.

It sucks a lot.

Most of the time it sucks.

Most of the time, yeah.

For us.
I mean,

we make money off of it, so.

And we don't have to
give him an allowance.

I give you an allowance.

Yeah, it's great.

(Tyler gargling)
(Mike laughing)


aren't you guys the Schultz family?

Yeah.
Yeah.


Tyler, right?
Yeah.


I'm very new, but I'm a huge fan.

Yeah.
And your dad's hilarious.

Love your videos.
Oh my God.


(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Hey.
Oh, yeah,

this is-
I can't believe.

Hey.
What's your name?

My name is Tyler Schultz,

and I'm a prankster and
a gamer on the side.

I made a Grinder account for my dad.

He's not gay.

The people on the app,
they keep calling him.

He's a bear. (chuckles)

I popped open the caps of all

of his beers and I poured them out

into the sink and replaced it

with non-alcoholic beer

and put 'em back in the same spot.

So, he's gonna have no idea.

I sold my dad's car on eBay.


Okay, Tyler, all right.

How you doing-
Hi, I'm his mom.

I'm Christine.
(laughs) That's good, nice

to meet you.
Nice to meet

you too, Granny.

Nice to meet you all.

I don't know them. (chuckles)

I don't know them. (laughs)

I don't know them.

Okay, you fanned out.
I love Tyler Schultz.

I will be the first to say it

and not the last.

That boy is hilarious.

Excuse me, what about me? Thank you.

Sis.

(Wai laughing)

up, Schultz family?

Yo, the prankster.

Yo, you guys are sick.

Oh yeah, RIP COVID.

COVID, uh.
COVID.

some great news, man.

If you can handle it,

we just had a spot open up in the camp.

For real?


Only thing, it's 500 bucks a person

and the spot is yours.

Okay, listen, if we do
this, it's no new drone.

Yeah, you can't have both, hun.

I need a new drone.

right now, camp, or drone.


or flying with the stars, man?

Make up your mind, kid.
This is a once

in a lifetime opportunity, kid.

I guess, if they really
need us, then we can.

(Christine laughing)
It's ridiculous.

No, okay, we're in.

Can we PayPal you, or something, or-


Honey, can you set that up?
Yeah, yeah, no problem-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

the Schultz family here.

What's up, man?

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Thank you so much, it's an honor,

it's a pleasure.


What?


Oh, that's crazy.

Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.

Good, guys, come on guys.

We'll just be back here.


Everything, so you see everything.


They paid everything, yeah.

(eerie music)

(male mumbling)

Yeah, 100 a piece.

(eerie sound effects)

Yeah.
Yeah, you know

what I mean?

Well, we already had the
fee from the other ones,

so you know what I mean?

It was like, it's all extra.

You know what I'm saying?

(people chattering)

â™ª I'm a hustler baby babe â™ª


Hi.


I'm sorry?


Okay.
Oh.

Hi, oh, yay!

[Mike] Thanks.
Hey.


(people chattering)

I don't know them.

All right, (indistinct) oh guys,

look that was (indistinct) a little bit.

A little bit scary,

but do not be discouraged,
ladies and gentlemen.

We left, Nadia left.

She experienced something,

which honestly I hope all you guys

have that same kind of experience.

And I just hope that you react

a little bit different.

Do not be scared.

This is why you're here, right?

Right.
Yeah.

We're here to get into...

And when one door closes,
another one opens.

We have another family
joining us right now.

Woo!
Make a noise

for the new family.

(group cheering and clapping)
Yeah.

And I'm really excited about...

I'm excited for you guys.

I am really excited (chuckles)

To see who's next.



Granny ready to go.

[Group] Uh!
Granny.

All right, all right.
(group cheering and clapping)

(people chattering)

I don't talk about that, I know.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

I'm trying to get that,
(Irene laughing)

I'm trying to get there.

[Chaz] Okay-
Okay, how far did

you wanna set your (mumbles)?


50 meters.

50 meters, okay.

Ooh.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

You at 50 meters.

There you go. Here you go.

Right now, it's all set,

but before we move, I need you

to focus on your objective.

I need you to really think, right?

Really put some focus on it

and when you're ready,

I want you to announce it to the group.

When you're ready, though.

(eerie sound effects)

My objective is knowledge.

I wanna be able to influence

this younger generation and let

'em know about my-

(eerie sound effects)


(crowd chattering and clapping)

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

We talking about old school.

Amen to that, amen to that.


to your destination you going.

Okay.


Here we go.

Let's follow her.

Right here.

What the...

How can I gain some knowledge right here

in the middle of all of
this trash and stuff.

Let me look at this.

Now, when I came here,

I thought it was gonna be

some kinda special monument,

or something that I can be proud of.

Granny's losing it.
And I just see

a whole bunch of junk and garbage.

Just the stress-

This is getting intense right now.

I don't even...
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

See in my generation-

It's getting so intense.

We have respect for something like this.

This is some of our
ancestors brought us here

and this is the legacy. (cries softly)

(male mumbling)

I got you.


Oh, I can't get it either.


How can you clean
spray paint with Windex?

Sorry.
Sorry.


Thank you for opening it.
Of course.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Love their scraping here.

Oh, that's great.

That's what I'm talking
about right there.


Well, I was so proud of you guys.

You did such a great job and-




a joyous occasion, my friend.

Joyous.
Joyous.


that we are blessed

with such great, (chuckles) great fortune.



if y'all gonna kill me.

No, no.
Just go ahead

and kill me, man.

No, no, no, no, no, no, kill you, no!

No, no, far from it.

Here, where is...

Oh yes, now here. Just taste-

[Toshman] No.
No, no, no, no.

Yeah, you just taste a little of that.

So, oh gosh, I think you're gonna like

this very much.

There you go.

Ooh, swallow, swallow,
swallow, swallow, swallow.

(Toshman groaning)
Oh, it is with great humility

and honor-
Humility.

Honor!
All right, that's enough.

Cut the shit, all right?

Be here, all right?

Yes, it is with great humility and honor,

we begin the sacred cleansing, commencing

with the ancient ceremonial joining

of your spirit with those of all

the warrior monks, who
have come before you.


Oh, I don't want my
spirit joining with y'all.

I don't know, don't wanna join 'em.

Yeah, listen to me, it's not up to you.

I mean, you think anybody
chooses this life?

Ah, God bless us.

You know, nature is often credited

as our true mother, but we believe

an ancient goddess has given us life, huh?

A beautiful fertile,
ferocious wrathful force.

She is called the Ecajutty.

Praise the Ecajutty.
Praise the Ecajutty,

yes, praise the Ecajutty.

And we, the Durga, are
sworn to protect her.

Throughout time, she is reincarnated

when her careless children fall

from her eye forgetting all that

she's taught them.

But miraculously, she's come again.

(Toshman chuckles)

We have identified her spirit in one

of your video makers.

She is called Deborah.

(eerie music)

You're talking about Granny?

Granny, yes. Yes.

Granny?

Yes, Granny.

Holy fuck!

Yes, holy fuck indeed, yes. (laughs)

Oh, guess what? The bull is here.

(Zel laughing)

(eerie music)

(male mumbling)

Oh, did I miss the hat part?

Yeah, well we can do
it again if you'd like.

Is this him?

(eerie music)

Yes.

[The Bull] He's so little.


the mother, mm-hmm, no, no, no.

I will leave you to it, all right?

Let's go, just go.
Hey, where...

Where y'all going?

Who you supposed to be?

I am the bull, this is your cleansing.

Oh, okay.

At some point you may feel

like you're gonna die,

but no one ever does. (laughs)

tubby, let's step it up.

(Tyler laughing)

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Did she just call her husband tubby?

Tubby. (laughs)

Thanks so much-
She got him

with the fat jokes. (laughs)

I think, I sense the
classic family argument.

walk, it's lifting stuff.

I'm doing a lot of work just by walking.

Just gimme a little bit of a break.

Can we have that?


a little more, it
wouldn't be so difficult.


keep recording this.
How difficult it is to-

Girl, I'm gonna-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

It's been a while since
the last one of these,

this is exciting.
I can't imagine

it's anything-
Can I hang out

with these trees.

I think, I'm not even here.


and now you're sorry.

Why in public do you
always need to do this?

(eerie sound effects)

Are we ever anywhere else?

Our whole life is public now.

When he looks at me, all I see

is that venom in your
face, it's disgusting.

start with that again.

Uh, the drama.


What are you gonna do?

What does it matter
(eerie sound effects)

If you're always protecting him?

How's he gonna grow up?
I'm gonna just...

I'm gonna take...

See, they need Granny in their life.

(eerie sound effects)


Oh.
Oh my God.

You all right?

Yeah.
You okay?

I'm okay, I'm...
You good?

Are you all right?
You good?

Yeah, I'm okay.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

No, no, no-
What happened?

No, I just need to

No, I think, you need-

Are you sure?
Let's go to the hospital.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

just caught on fire.

It fully explode...

Oh.
You look like

you might be burned.

I just need to go to the hospital.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(people chattering)

Hey, bud.


Can we talk a little bit.

I just want to go back to the hotel.

Can we just go back to the hotel?

think you're right, Wai.

I think I'm done.

It's time, I'm done-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
Stop, stop, stop.

Stop.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Stop it, stop it, stop it.

That's creepy.
You literally don't know-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Thank you so much.


what we came here to do.
Oh, who paid a lot

of money, Alia?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)


I think (indistinct)
paid a lot of money.

What is that supposed to
me, are you coming for-


'cause she doesn't care, bye.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Go to the hotel.
Bye.


Chaz, listen, Greg-


Stop, that's not Chaz, stop.

Shut up. Chaz, listen-


I'm gonna time, we gonna
take a break too, man.


Chaz! Chaz!
Stop.

We just made up

and you're already being stupid again.


(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

I'm here now, so.

I mean, listen, I get it.

We're really shitty white people, 100%.

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

(groaning squealing sound effects)

Great, great.
(male chuckling)

Okay, bye.
(groaning sound effects)

We'll see you later.

Okay, bye.
(squealing sound effects)

Oh, you did such a great job-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

I could see it, yeah.

Thank you, guys.

Oh, yeah, she's not a good fit.

White interpreters, you know?

She seems like she was very sticky.


I don't know sign language.

It's cool looking, though.

Yeah, look, it looks pretty cool.

Man, you right, that guy doesn't look

anything like Chaz.

(upbeat music)

All right, so everyone
listen to me, I won.

And we're gonna stay out.

We're gonna do our final
Epifanati's for everyone.

Chaz left and I really
don't think we need him.

I kind of got the vibe down, right?

I got this.

I'm next to go, but-
It literally makes no sense.

I got something setup-



I am ready. I'm ready to go.

That's all I'm gonna say.

I am ready to go. So, I'm going next.

Here's my phone.

I am setting out the distance.

Let's do 100, 100 meters.

(eerie music)

And my intention.

My intention is I want
to understand deeper

into the occult.

Shall we focus on that? How about that?

Freaky things is happening anyway.

Let's go for it.

Like, is everyone crazy? (chuckles)

This is like literally so scary.

I guess, I just have to lean into it.

Who's scared?

Are you scared at home?
Meditate on what

your objective is.

I hope you're in a safe spot.


I feel a little like bad vibe.

(eerie music)

No, the magician and string.

Okay, this is freaking me out.

(eerie music)

The fool. They are
clearly messing with me.

They are clearly messing with me.

So, I'm gonna scare them.

(somber music)

is to be a simple right,

but it's not without its perils. (laughs)

Yes, whereas, the Catholics wait

for possession before removing a spirit

from the unwilling host.

Yes, (chuckles) we are protected.

We have the tools to drive

the evil Gin away before it takes hold.

Now, would you hand me
that brass bell, please?

(bell ringing)

Eh, no (chuckles) the big one.

(bell ringing)
Oh my God.

Thank you. (chuckles)

He's pathetic, isn't he?

All right, now, what's going on there?


Yeah.
What?

Yes.

What? Oh!

Come on, that's why they're so small,

you don't see them anywhere, gone forever.

(Zel mumbling)

All right. Uh-oh, what's going on there?

What is he...

I'd like to hear what he's
saying, would that be-

(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

Yeah, but...


I'm just disappointed.

Shit, as soon as I realized
Granny wasn't here,

I should have been out partying.

(static buzzing)

What happened? You've lost the sound.

I need to hear what he's saying,

don't you understand?

I'm trying.

Well, try harder. Come on, come on.

What's it, what's it?


I know why I must have gone somewhere.

I just don't know where.

You know what?

You guys, honestly, I
know where I am, okay?

I'm gonna figure it out.

All right, but I'm gonna take

this mask off now, okay?

'Cause I'm just about done with this mask

and I have no one around me.

So, why the fuck not, right?

(crickets stridulating)

(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

It's Malik's phone.

(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

I'll just give Malik his phone back

when I see him.

(crickets stridulating)

And I know I'll come across someone soon.

It'll be fine. What?

(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

(Irene crying)

Where are they? Where are they?

(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

Oh my God, oh my God. (crying)

Oh my God.

I mean, I brought you seven souls.

Shit, 10 really.

(somber music)

I forgot I threw

I knew they was gonna fall,

but I'm sitting here chained.

Man, this is some bullshit!

(eerie music)

Huh? Oh, I see.
(eerie sound effects)

So, they brought their leader here?

(eerie music)

to protect this young man's soul.

(eerie music)

From the jaw of depravity of the Gin.

(eerie music)

Uh!
Oh.

She has abandoned us.

Yes, she has.
(eerie sound effects)

We have failed.

The Gin has taken him.

It must be executed. Hold him.

No, you son of a bitch. No. (crying)

Bring him back, bring him back!

(soft music)

But it was here in these secluded woods

where those dreams met
a terrifying conclusion.

After just one day

at the camp, authorities say counselors

and campers met a gruesome end.

Nine people are dead with one

in critical condition

and two others still missing.

Those bodies discovered here and reported

to police by the man at the center

of this story, Chaz
Bruce, who authorities say

was the only to escape without a scratch.

Being hailed as a hero by some, police say

he is being considered a person

of interest in this case,

but is yet to officially
be named a suspect.

Meantime, Claktion is moving forward

with its release,

while its sponsor app, Epifanati,

has ceased all operations.

With no suspects in custody

and no concrete evidence
discovered just yet

in this case, authorities say

they'll be combing through

the videos posted online,

or broadcast live during that camp

in hopes of finding any clues

as to who may be responsible

for this heinous crime.

I'm Jeffrey Stone reporting,
that's the latest.

Back to you.

(soft music)

(eerie music)

Show me the power of thunder.

Hey.

Feel, feel the power.
Hey! Hey.

Feel the thunder.

Yes, let it out.

Feel it rising in your body.

(eerie music)

Yes.

Hey!

Where you at, you light
skinned mother fucker?
