[Eric sighs]

Have you figured out how to pay
your tuition next semester?

[Eric sighs]

We've tried about everything,
but it's hopeless.

Just can't afford it.

So that's that. Game over.
See you around.

[cellphone buzzes]

Go ahead.

[notification chimes]

No way.

[upbeat rock music]

[crowd cheering]
[cameras snapping]

[notification chimes]

Down. Go down.

[video game music playing]

Right. Move right.

[cellphone ringing, buzzing]

[Lily laughs]

[both] Yes!
[Lily] Let's get a drink.

[Lily sighs]

Can I get water?
Water.

Soda.
Soda.

[cellphone ringing, buzzing]

It's Peter.

See what he says.

[cellphone chimes]

Peter! What do I owe
the pleasure of your call?

I hear you and Lily are going to
be beta testing Russell's new game.

You have your own gaming
company to worry about.

<i>What's it to you?</i>
[Peter chuckles]

Let's just say
a little bird told me.

[Lily over phone] <i>It was easy.</i>

I hacked into their system and
left a little subroutine.

It's a recursive operation
that submits our names

with a callback frequency of
every five seconds.

[Lily chuckles]
Wow, color me impressed.

It was nothing.

Ass kissing aside, Peter,
what do you want?

We never hear from you
unless you want something.

Through my own means,
I'll be in the game with you.

Yeah, good luck with that.

We'll need more than luck.
I want to win.

We can figure this game
out in the process

and produce a copy of it.

How about we partner up?

I have a plan that will guarantee
we win the five million.

We'll split it
three ways equally.

Think about it. Not bad, right?

Well, five million split
two ways is even better. Hm?

[Lily chuckles]

Would you two rather work with
me or against me? [chuckles]

You might end up with
nothing at all.

He's got a point.

Dinosaurs are gonna
be hard enough.

I'd rather not have
to worry about

this sneaky asshole
stabbing us in the back.

[Peter over phone] <i>So?
Can I count on your cooperation?</i>

Mm. Okay.

We're in.

But we gotta share
the prize equally.

Cool. You're on.

[cellphone chimes]

[cellphone clicking]

[gentle music]

[cellphone buzzing]

[woman over phone] <i>Hey.</i>
Hey.

Is he asleep yet?

He just passed out
waiting for your call.

<i>But we should let him
sleep for now.</i>

When you tried calling earlier,
I was working. Sorry.

He's probably upset with me.

<i>Don't let it get to you.</i>

He'll understand.

Mm.

Hey, know what?


[Alex over phone] <i>You know how
much he likes to play the games</i>

made by Mental Abyss? Well,
they're releasing a new one.

I signed up as
a volunteer tester.

And you won't believe
what happened.

Me, they've selected me
to take part.

I really wanted to tell him
today, but I was swamped.

And I just got back.

I'll tell him in the morning.</i>

<i>You know, he's gonna go crazy.</i>

I better get going.
Tomorrow's another long day.

Love you.

Love you too.

[Alex sighs]

[upbeat music]

Hi.
Hm?

You were picked for
the beta too?

Mm-hm.
[Eason chuckles]

Their games are great.
I've played every single one.

Wow, cool.

Oh, what do you think that is?

I'm gonna go check it out.

[Eric chuckles]
[Eason] Oh, I recognize this.

[chuckles] It's the...
Oh!

Sorry about that.
It's okay.

Excuse me.

Um, I'm...

Whoa.



The name's Eric. I know you.

Yeah? Well, I don't know you.

[Eason] Sorry.
Beat it.

My friend must be mixed up.

What do you think? Our AR tech

[testers laughing]

Hello, players. Welcome.

You made it.
[testers applauding]

[Eason chuckles]

you've ever experienced before.

There are two things
to remember.

First, when you enter the game,

there will be
backpacks scattered

throughout the starting field.

Each one will carry a variety of
equipment to aid you.

<i>The second is that
there are no rules.</i>

<i>Players still alive
after four hours</i>

<i>share the grand prize
pot of five million.</i>

<i>And if you're the last one
standing, you take it all.</i>

<i>Now get ready. Start-up can be
a bit disorienting.</i>

<i>Welcome to "Dinosaur World."</i>

<i>Let the game begin.</i>

Thank me later. We still got 12 hours in here.

[both sighing]

Thanks.

I know it's not real,
but it sure feels real.

Heart's beating like crazy.

I've never been so scared
before.

We've been hounded nonstop
since we got here.

[Eric sighs]

[Eason sniffs]

You smell something?

Did you fart?

Huh? It's you.

Huh?

You're covered in dinosaur spit.

[Eric chuckles]

[saliva squishes]

[Eric chuckles]
[Eason sniffs, groans]

[Eric laughing]

I suppose they meant it when
they said it was real, huh?

That?

If this part feels real,

then what would being

[raptor calling]

We should head back now and
see if there are any bags left.

[raptor calls]

[raptor calls]

[tense music]

Lily, grab that one.

With a little cover,

this place should be
safe for a while.

If we're lucky, the T-rex scared
away the other players

and, hopefully, the smaller
dinosaurs as well.

That's not exactly a reassuring sentiment.

I can't guarantee anything.

We know next to nothing
about the game.

That said, if it's like
the others I've played,

hiding won't work for long.

Sooner or later,
it's fight or flight.


What d'you think?
Huh?

It's good.

Let's rest.
Oh, yeah.

Huh?
My name is Eason, by the way.

Oh. Eric.

Nice to meet you.

I think we should team up
if we want to win.

I can really use that
prize money.

Yeah, sounds good.
Hope we make it.

Did you have a look
in your bag yet?

Not yet.

Hm.

I got a rope, looks like.
[Eason chuckles]

Rope against dinosaurs?
What good is this?

Whoa!

[knife rasps]
Got this knife too.

Mm.

Seriously, talk about
ineffective.

Not against players.
Huh?

[Eason chuckles]

Hey! Medicine.

I may live through
this after all.

When I fell during the chase,
I got scratched up.

Hey, help me with this?

It'll probably sting a bit.

[Eason chuckles]

I'm tough. I survived a Tyrannosaurus rex.
I can take anything...

[Eason screams]
Really, tough guy?

[both chuckling]

[Eason groans]
Don't be so loud, dude.

Just a bit more.
[Eason chuckles]

All right, calm down, dude.
[Eason groans]

Nearly there. Almost done.
[Eason whimpers]

[Eric chuckles]
The man survived at T-rex,

defeated by salve.

[Tyrannosaurus rex roars]

Let's get back inside.

[Tyrannosaurus rex roars]

We need to keep
a low profile for now.

[group panting]


Yeah.

I hope there's something
awesome in here.

[Lily chuckles]
Hey, how about this?

Hm?

[tense music]
What do you think this is?

[device beeping, hums]

Whoa. Cool, man.

It's a smaller version
of the game map.

Hey, what are the dots for?

I think the green dots show
our current position.

Red dots are likely
the dinosaurs.

There's no way we can
lose with this.

[Lily laughs]

Not really. It doesn't display
the other players.

Antivenom?


Toxic dinosaur?

Ha!

This.
[baton crackles]

This is what I'm talking about.

Nice. That could be fun.
[baton crackling]

We've got to go, quick.

[device beeps]
[Jeremy] Okay.

We just stay here hidden.

running for our lives.

We'll win this for sure.
[Eric] Shh. Someone's here.

[Vivian scoffs] Amateurs.

[Vivian grunts]
[Eason] Hey!

The hell?!

Why'd she do that?

'Cause she's mean.
What you did...

It's a mess.

Hey!

Was this your master plan,

to hide behind some sticks?

Yeah, he was almost eaten
in the first few minutes.

What? Wasn't only me.

Look, she's hurt,
and no use to us.

We should take her out.

She hasn't done anything to us.
She needs help.

I get that, but it'd be
one less person

we need to worry about.

If we don't work together,

I don't think anybody's
gonna win this game.

I won't do it.

[Vivian] What are you doing?
I'm gonna help you.

Hold on. She might just
be faking it.

No, I don't think so.

[Eric sighs]
Don't you dare.

It's okay.

Trust me.

[gentle music]


I'm going to need your medicine.

But we might need it.
Hurry.

Okay. Before I begin,
could you pull your shirt down?

Ju... ju... just a little so I can
see the wound.

If you try to take advantage
of me, you're dead.

I won't, I promise.

[light jingling]

It feels so real.

Trust me, I know.

So how did someone so tough
get hurt so bad?

I was careless.

It didn't take long for people
to turn on each other.

I'm Vivian.

I'm Eric.

His name's Eason.


Okay.

All done.

Thank you.

No problem.

Hey, is this a dating app
or a game?

[upbeat music]

Whatever, dude.

She just left us here.

[Vivian panting]

[Eason] Wait, hold on a sec.
[Eric] What are you doing?

[raptor snarls]
[both whimpering]

[thrilling music]

Help!

Help.

Help me.

Help!

[man grunting]

Over there. He needs help.

Grab on!

[rocks clattering]

Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

What's happening?

Wait, wait. We're friendly.

Don't worry, fellas.
[Eason] We're friendly.

This will be quick.

Oh, yeah.
Another player is dead.

[Lily chuckles]
Let me see.

Pterodactyl got him.

[Lily chuckles]

That building is too big for there
not to be something useful in it.

Let's go.

[pterodactyls screeching]

[door rumbling]

Hey, hey!
[banging]

[Eric] Open the door!
[Eason] Open up!

I open this door for you,
and we all die!

Why didn't you let us in?!

[raptor calls]
We're trapped.

Any idea how to get
out of this one?

[Eric panting]

[raptor screeches]

Hey.
[Eric] Huh?

What are you here for?

[Eric sighs]
I attend a local university.

[Eason] Uh-huh.
Masters in paleontology.

It was going pretty well,

but a year ago,
my mother became very ill.

The medical bills
are adding up.

On top of the tuition,
we just can't afford it.

Might have to drop out
and take care of her.

competition is your best shot.

It is.

The prize money could
go a long way

in paying for her procedures

and giving me a chance
to stay here.

[raptor snarls, screeches]

[Eric] And you?
Me?

what you'd call fulfilling.

Wanted some fun.

I'm a math teacher,
and I hate math.

Math?
Yeah. [chuckles]

That sounds awful.

Right?
[Eric laughs]

[raptor screeches]

I tried my best for my students,

but it just wasn't enough.

They still don't like me.

This test is being
streamed online,

so let's win the prize
to show them...

that they have a cool teacher.

They're not just gonna
give it to you.

I know that, idiot.
Unlike you two, I have a plan.

I asked you to join me because
you're supposed to be the best,

so less talk, more show.

[Peter scoffs]

I think he's alone.

[baton crackling]
Wait, he's still armed.

Hey, I got this.

[Lily sighs]

[Lily panting]

Don't shoot!

I'm unarmed.

[upbeat music]
[man grunts]

Slowly.

Are you alone?
Yes.

I was with another player,
but a raptor killed him,

and I ran this way as
fast as I could.

Have you killed anything
with that big gun?

[man chuckles]

Yeah, I just got three raptors.

[Lily chuckles]

It's so big.

[man chuckles]
You're so strong.

[man groaning]

Seriously?

Come on, guys!
[Jeremy] Bye.

You can't leave me
here like this.

Hey!
Hm?

Look, I don't even want the gun.
You can have it.

Just please let me go!

Sorry, can't do that.

Oh, by the way,

I've seen bigger. Hm.

Help!

[man in distance] Somebody help!
Wait. Did you hear something?

No.
[man in distance] Help!

You heard it that time.

Yeah, I did.

[man] Hey, help me!
That way!


Hey, someone's coming.

[ominous music]

[man groaning]



Hey. Hey, over here.

Could you guys help me? Please.

[woman] What do you think?
[sighs] I don't know.

How did you manage to
get yourself in this position?

I was tricked by three assholes.

They took my rifle.
Would you guys just get me outta here

so I can go kill them?

He's pissed.
[panting]

Might come in useful.

Yeah. All right.

Just hold on.

Everyone will be

Well, then, let's go back.

Poison.
[Eddie gasps]

Come on, that was so close.

Wait, did you seriously
catch that dart?

Wait right here.
Hm.

Hey, hey, man, I'm sorry!

Hold on!
It's just a game, dude!

[man panting]

Hey! Stop!

Keep away.

You crazy?!

Why'd you shoot it at a kid for?

What's your problem, man?

You are, you spineless coward.

too weak to fight back.

Where is he?

I killed him.

[gentle music]

I had no choice.

You saved my life.

Yeah, of course.

That's the second time
I saved you.

Let's not make it a habit, okay?

Thank you.
You're very welcome.

Now do you trust me?

Okay.

Okay.

Let's get the new supplies.
Come on.

Don't fall behind.

[notification chimes]
[interface buzzing]

That way.

Give me it.

How come no one has
shown up yet?

I don't like waiting.

We don't know how many
players are left.

Don't worry, whoever's
still alive will show up.

for this anyway?

game designer.

Most of my classmates
love his games.

We all wanted to be chosen
to test "Dinosaur World."

You don't know how envious
my classmates are

that I got picked.

So I tried to stay hidden.

I know I probably
won't win the prize,

but I didn't want to get
killed too soon.

I have a son about
the same age as you.

He really loves the games
Russell makes too.

What do you do in
the real world?

You don't look like a gamer.

I'm a bodyguard for
the rich and powerful.

My job usually keeps me
away from home.

I don't get to see
my son very much.

My son was looking
forward to this game,

so I signed up to surprise him.

I thought that if I won
the competition,

maybe I'd be a little bit
closer to him.

I didn't expect to be chosen.

When the game is over,
we'll have a lot to talk about.

Hopefully, he'll be proud of me,
you know?

I would be proud if
you were my dad.

[Alex chuckles]

Let's team up. Come on.

[Eddie sighs]

[shoulders thudding]
[both groaning]

Where were you?

I got lost.

Huh.

[ground rumbling]
Huh?

What's going on?

Feels like an earthquake.
[tree cracking]

Let's go.

[ominous music]

[man panting]

[tree cracking]
[man groans]

[raptor screeches]

[man panting]

[explosion blasting]

Whoa. See that?

Man, they thought of everything.

[man panting]

[raptor screeching]

[beeping]
[man grunting]

Quick. Shoot him.

Wait. Something's chasing him.

[device humming]

[music continues]

[man groans]
[raptor snarling]

[raptor screeches]

[man grunts]
[bag clatters]

[raptor screeching]

[raptor snarls]

[man screams]
[raptor screeches]

Oh, damn!

Shh.

One less to worry about.
Can't be many more. [chuckles]

[raptor screeches]

We're not the only ones here.

This doesn't feel right.

[scope clicking]

[Eric gasps]

[suspenseful music]

There.

They're camping the supplies,

picking off those
who come along.

[raptor snarls]

[raptor screeches]

[raptor screeching]
Hey, over there.

[raptor screeches, snarls]

This is too easy.
[raptor screeches]

[Lily chuckles]

[raptor screeches]

[raptor screeching]

[raptor screeches]

[raptor chirping]

[raptor screeches]

[Alex grunts]
[kick thuds]

[hand chops]
Wow!

[gun fires]
[bullet thuds]

[Eddie gasps]
[rifle clicks]

Watch out!
[- rifle fires]

[Eddie grunts]
[Alex groans]

[Eddie groans]

Eddie!

Hang on. [grunting]

[music continues]

[Peter chuckles]

Just a bit longer.

They ran after them.
Now's a good time to get a bag.

Wait.
[Vivian grunts]

Okay, but let's be quick.

Hurry!

Eddie, hold on.

We have to win, remember?

Just leave me.

Why did you do that?
You could've got away.

You saved my life twice.

I still owe you one.

You're a good kid.

You're gonna be all right.

Besides, if you
still owe me one,

you have to hang on for me,
okay?

Go. They'll be here any moment.

[Eddie groans]

This is painful.

[Eddie groans]

[gentle music]

Hey. Hey!

You're gonna wake up
safe and sound.

Kid, I'll make them pay for
what they did to you.

[Alex grunts]

[monitor whirring]

Weird.


Where's the other one?

Poor kid.

Better luck next time.


[sighs]
[key jingles]

It's our lucky day.

Look at this.
You found the key.

Now the jeep is ours. Let's go.

[bag zipping]

Someone's over there.

[rifle clicks]

[gun fires]
[Eric gasping]

[Vivian gasps]

They're here! Run!

[both panting]
[dramatic music]

I don't think they're armed.

It'll be hard to track down
where they went,

but they need to die.

Lily and I will go after them.

You check the supplies.

Okay. I'll check the bags.

Go.

[tense music]

[dart rasps]

Huh? [groans]

[Jeremy grunts]
[kick thuds]

[both grunting]
[punch thuds]

[dart thuds]
[Alex grunts]

Time to pay for what you did.

[Jeremy groaning]

Help.

[both panting]

[Jeremy in distance] Help!

Jeremy.

That guy with the kid we shot.

What happened?

Poison dart.

[Jeremy groaning]
[rifle fires]

[Lily groans]

Did you get him?

He got away. How's Jeremy?
It's poison.



I threw away the antivenom.



He also took the scope.

Damn it!

This guy's tough.
We need to be cautious.

What about the other two?!

Gone.

Great. [groans]

[groans] Damn it!
[headset clatters]

[Alex grunts]

[footsteps rustling]

[suspenseful music]
[bugs chirping]

Hey.
[Eric gasps]

Shh.

I'm not a threat.

I know who's chasing you.
They're chasing after me as well.

We saw them shoot that boy.

Was he your friend?
Mm.

So we should team up and kill
those two and be done with it.

Huh? Weren't there three?

Managed to poison one. Got him!

So what should we do now?

It won't be long before
the game's over,

and it doesn't seem like
there are many players left.

Those two pose the only threat.

They're professional gamers.

As if that wasn't bad enough,

they've got a sniper rifle.

As things are,
we can't compete against that.

The grand prize means nothing.
I don't even want it.

But I want to make sure

they don't get
their hands on it either.

I promised Eddie
that I will avenge him.

Mm-hm.

So let's assess our situation,
come up with a plan.

Do you have anything in
your bag we can use?

Oh.

I have two hand grenades.

You should take one.

Mm.

Hey, I got the scope.

I don't need it anymore.
Take it.

[dramatic music]
[raptor screeching]

Move! Move!
[raptor growling]

[raptors screeching]

[Eric whimpers]
Hey. Go!

[Eric grunts]
[raptor screeching]

[Eric grunting]

[rock thuds]

[hologram buzzing]

[both panting]

Take it.

[device beeps, hums]

Something found them.

Maybe the dinos will
kill them for us.

We have to make sure.

They didn't last this long
with only luck.

[device beeps, hums]
All right, let's go.

Mm-hm.
Clock's ticking.

[raptor screeches]
[punches thudding]

[Alex sighs]

Not bad, you two.

Alex, there's one
more over there!

[raptor screeches, snarls]

[raptor screeching]

[Alex grunting]

[log thuds]
[hologram buzzing]

[rifle fires]
[Alex groans]

Go! This way!

[Eric panting]

[Alex groaning]

[suspenseful music]

[intense music]

[Alex grunts]

[grenade rattles]
[gasps] Grenade!


[explosion booms]
[both yelping]


You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

This guy doesn't give up.

Even with a bullet in him,
he nearly took us out.

Are you sure you can kill him?

Yeah.

With those wounds,
he won't be alive much longer.

[gentle music]

We made a good team.

You have to go. Just leave me.

But we haven't helped
you avenge Eddie.

The longer you stay here,
the more dangerous it becomes.

Live and fight on.

Run.

I swear, we're not gonna
let them win this game.


and get rid of those
two bastards.

Now get going.


Don't move!

He's still alive.

I'm sure I got him.

You're a lousy shot!

Your aim was off!

Then prove it!

Seriously?!
Didn't you see your friend?!

You want to end up like him?

You two won't stand
a chance against me.

Listen, how about you step out

and we can talk through
a solution to this?

[somber music]

[suspenseful music]

Is he dead?

One of the best players
I've ever seen.

What about the other two?

We still need to take them out.

[notification chimes]
[interface buzzing]

[volcano erupting]

[Peter groans]

There's not much time. Let's go.

Get the jeep.
Okay.

[both panting]

We can't stay here.

It's too dangerous.
[Tyrannosaurus rex growls]

[Tyrannosaurus rex chomps]

[Tyrannosaurus rex growls]
[dramatic music]

[Eric screaming]

[both panting]

Man the gun.
Yeah.

Woo! [laughs]

[Peter grunts]

Let's get those two.

[engine rumbling]

Yeah! [laughs]
Yeah!


[insects buzzing]

Hey, Eric!
[Eric gasps]

[Eason chuckles]
How's it going down there?

Are you kidding, dude?

You're actually still alive?

Yeah. Pterodactyl dropped me
in her nest and flew away.

I found some Easter eggs.

Easter eggs?
Yup.

Come here.
[Eric chuckles]

[thrilling music]

Let me show you.
See? There.

<i>I can talk to dinosaurs.</i>


[both chuckling]

Huh?

Hey, do you hear that?
[jeep rumbling]

Sounds like an engine.

Over there.

[jeep rumbling]

It's them. They've got
themselves a jeep.

Huh. Of course they did.

And it's got a machine gun.

Then we're as good as dead.

What do we do?

We can't take them on.

[triceratopses growling]

Triceratopses.
Huh?

Where?

They're like scale-covered
battering rams.

If only we can use 'em somehow.

I got this.

[Eason grunts]

[Eric sighs]

[Eric chuckles]

Where are you going?
[jeep rumbling]

[pterodactyl screeching]

[pterodactyls screeching]

What are you waiting for?!
Shoot!

[Lily grunting]
[machine gun firing]

Yeah! [laughs]
[pterodactyls screeching]

Huh?

No more ammo!

[Tyrannosaurus rex roars]

a black jeep heading that way.

All right. Gonna talk to the
pterodactyl and T-rex now.

Thanks, guys.

[Eason chuckles]

Okay, they're gonna help us out.

[Eric chuckles]
You sure they got the message?

You doubt me?

[Eric laughs]

[Eason inhales, roars]

[triceratopses roaring]

Come on!
[Eric whimpering]

[upbeat music]

[tires screeching]

[Lily screams]
[Peter grunts]

[jeep crashes]
[Peter groaning]

Why are they chasing us?

[coughs, groans]

[triceratops roars]
[Peter] It's those two.

I'm sure of it.


[suspenseful music]

[Peter grunting]

[Peter sighs]


[dramatic music]

[triceratops roars]




[Lily groans]

[Lily grunts]
[headset clatters]

[ground rumbling]
[both gasping]

[volcano erupting]

It's the volcano.

We should get to higher ground.

Yeah.

[timer beeping]

The game's nearly over.
Almost there.

Yeah.

[Eason sighing]

[dramatic music]

[Eason sighs]

[Eric sighing]

[Peter grunting]
[Eason groans]

Hey!
It's over!

Wait.
Come any closer, and he's dead!

I win!

[Eason groans]
Hey, easy. Easy.

It's okay.
Don't you move!

It's okay. It's okay.

Not a muscle!
Wait, wait, wait.

Stay back...
Forget about me.

...or I'll kill you too!
I swear it!

But I know how you can get
what you really want.

It's not worth it.
I know, it's not about the money.

You want to copy the code.

We found an Easter egg.
It's yours.

What?
If you let him go.

Don't do it.

Take me. I'll show you.

[music continues]

[Peter grunting]
[Eric groans]

Good game.

Huh?
Hey, man, Easter egg's right here.

It's a gift from Alex.

Oh, greedy!
