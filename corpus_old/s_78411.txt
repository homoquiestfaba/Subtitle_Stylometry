<i>I am just a poor boy</i>

Though my story's seldom told

I have squandered my resistance

For a pocketful of mumbles

Such are promises

All lies and jest

Still, a man hears
what he wants to hear

<i>Just a come-on from those gals
Just a come-on from the whores</i>

On Seventh Avenue
Whoo-whoo!

<i>L...
I do declare</i>

<i>There were times
when I was so lonesome</i>

<i>That I took
some comfort there</i>

<i>La-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

<i>Bonnie?</i>

<i>Who is it?</i>

<i>Donovan?</i>

<i>Bonnie?
Yes?</i>

<i>Donovan?</i>

<i>In here!</i>

<i>Yes? Donovan
Is everything all right?</i>

<i>Yeah The production meeting
was put off, so I thought... Who's here?</i>

<i>Here?
Mm</i>

Who owns that piece-of-shit van
down there?

Oh...

It's just a guy, you know, going
door-to-door selling pool cleaner

So why did he
lock himself in the den?

Well, he...

Oh, God

Remember my friend Ollie?
Ollie Olerud?

Short, cretinous wanker?

Ohh Ollie's in there?

Yes
I see

Well, I'm glad
he finally got himself a job

I'd always picked him as some sort of
deadbeat, but happy to be proved wrong

<i>So, he's selling
pool cleaner now, huh?</i>

Well, this is the neighborhood for that Just
door-to-door... "Running low on chlorine?"

It's quite a coincidence,
him just dropping by

and you two
knowing each other so well

<i>Donovan, please, let's just
all talk... How you doin'?</i>

Donovan? How you doin', man?

<i>Good day, Ollie
I'm great You?</i>

I can't complain, man

Excellent

Well, let's get right
down to it then, shall we?

We'll take a couple vacuum hoses We probably
need a new filter right about now, maybe...

<i>Wait a minute, darling Do we
actually have a swimming pool?</i>

Okay, okay, man Now, let's be
reasonable about this, okay?

So, you caught me porkin'...

<i>havin'relations
with your old lady</i>

Oh, God

<i>and now we're all feelin' just a little bit
embarrassed by the whole thing, so, uh...</i>

<i>What the hey, man</i>

I mean, I know it's a drag and all,
but these things...

Hey! Hey, hey

<i>Uh, w-we... we...
we didn't actually have sex</i>

I was depressed 'cause
I'm impotent You know?

Unable to achieve an erection

<i>I have been
for over a year now, man,</i>

and I needed someone to talk to

<i>I mean, think about it, man
Ayear without an erection?</i>

Miles Massey's office

<i>Oliphant v Oliphant, relevance to Chapman...
She said she took the kids to Tahoe?</i>

That's right Wait, which side ofTahoe?

She's on some kind of cruise

Yeah, well, if the cruise goes all the way around
the lake, she's left the state and she's in breach

Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing
to attach A filing to attach

What do you want in it?
Everything

Primary residence, beach house, ski
cabin, auto, stocks, bonds, dental floss

Everything
Uh-huh Gonna lose ya

Uh-huh

And tell Fred Armatrading that we finally
have pictures of his wife with the oral surgeon

Oh, and get a fruit and pastry basket in the conference
room for my 9:30 Didn't have time for breakfast

Where are you?
Comin' at ya

Your 9:00 is here
Bonnie Donaly

Bonnie Donaly

Mrs Donaly

Hmm

Mm-hmm

Hmm

Yes, your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures,

and, yes,
absent a swimming pool,

the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious

But, madam,
who is the real victim here?

Let me suggest to you
the following

<i>Your husband, on a prior occasion,
had slapped you... beat you</i>

<i>I think that word is not
inappropriate No, I...</i>

Let me finish, please

I'm not concerned
with who slapped whom first

<i>Your husband, who had beaten
you repeatedly... No, he never...</i>

Please... repeatedly, was at the time
brandishing your firearm

It was his gun
And we'll get it back for you

Trying, in his rage,
to shoot an acquaintance,

a friend of long standing

They never really cared
for each other

And if not for your
cool-headed intervention,

his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own

As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

wasn't it in fact he
who was sleeping with the pool man?

No?
Am I going too far here?

<i>Were his sexual... No
I don't...</i>

Sorry I'm not omniscient

The point is that he acted upon an
assumption which he cannot prove,

and I take it you deny

Well...
Fine I'll take the case

<i>It's imperative that I meet with Oliver
Olerud before we proceed any further</i>

so that I can massage the kinks
out of our testimony

Do you really think
we can put all this across?

The truth is so self-evident
to me, Mrs Donaly,

<i>that I'm sure I'll be able to make it
equally as transparent to anyjury,</i>

should your husband
decide to take it that far

We'll need to caucus again to draw up
a picture of your husband's net worth

A map of enemy territory,
so to speak

<i>You said he's a television producer?
He has a soap opera... The Sands of Time</i>

It's a silly show

Well, it'll be yours soon

Thank you very much

Thank you, Mr Massey
Yeah Bye-bye

Still, you have to admire him
for taking those pictures

<i>Now, Mrs Gutman,</i>

<i>you testified that you were
your husband's sexual slave</i>

<i>for 36 years
during your marriage</i>

Except for two years when he
was in the navy in Southeast Asia

And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

<i>I was a hostess
for Braniff Airlines</i>

And what is
your husband's profession?

He manufactures staples
and industrial brad tacks

<i>He's very successful</i>

How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

Well, at first he was
a very gentle and tender lover

<i>But then he became
more and more fixated</i>

<i>on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds</i>

<i>I can't help it
You don't decide to become bored</i>

It just happens
You're just looking for trouble

It's a midlife crisis

Look, get yourself
a new car

I have a new car

I have two new cars and a tab
at the Mercedes dealership

Torn the house down
twice,

rebuilt
the cabin in Vail,

got three of those, uh
yard people...

Gardeners? Gardeners I've
got a man who waxes my jet

These encounters
were videotaped

Sometimes
there would be a gizmo

<i>A gizmo?</i>

He had a device
he called the Intruder

<i>It was something he had
the engineers at the factory design</i>

<i>And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner</i>

I see

<i>So the vacuum cleaner wasn't
available to me for several months</i>

<i>Several months without
the appliance Yes!</i>

The problem is, everyone
is willing to compromise

That's the problem with the institution
of marriage It's based on compromise

Even through
its dissolution

Mrs Gutman here,
she's gonna score some points

concerning her husband's
sexual politics

Naturally,
we'll try to impeach

And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point

based on the skill
of the individual lawyers

Then both parties will go home with
their portion of the staple factory

That's life
Life is compromise

That's not life
That's death

<i>Struggle and challenge and ultimate
destruction of your opponent... that's life</i>

Let me ask you
something

Attila the Hun

Thank you, Mrs Gutman Ivan
the Terrible Henry the Eighth

Mr Massey, any questions?
What do they have in common?

Middle name No They didn't
just win They... They...

<i>Mr Massey?
They destroyed...</i>

<i>Mr Massey, again I ask,</i>

have you any questions
for the complainant?

I'm sorry, Your Honor I was
just consulting with an associate

Now, Mrs Gutman,

do you know a man
named David Gonzalez?

Well, he's the tennis pro at the club

The tennis pro?

Then why are your letters addressed to him,
"Dear David and Goliath"?

Whoo! Whoo!

Go, Rexie!

Go, Rexie baby!

<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

Whoo!

Rexie!

Oh, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Yo' ass!

I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Come to papa!

<i>I'm gon'nail ya!
Yeah, I got ya!</i>

<i>I'm gon'nail yo'ass!
Enough, I say!</i>

<i>Hold it!

<i>A silly misunderstanding...
Mm-hmm Someone nailed yo'ass!</i>

Mm-hmm, yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

<i>I'm gon'nail yo' ass!</i>

Yep, I nailed his ass

I thought he'd outgrown trains

They never grow up, lady
They just get tubby

How charming An aphorist

Oh, yeah, I've always
had ample proportions

But believe you me, it's all muscle
I'm as hard as a rock

I'm not one of these cream puff,
sit-behind-the-desk private dicks

I'm an ass-nailer
So I see

Gym four times a week...
hour and a half, plus stretching,

LifeCycle, LifeStep, LifeCircuit

Gus Petch don't pussyfoot around

I must say, for someone in your line of work,
you don't exhibit a great deal of tact

You want tact, call a tactician You
want an ass nailed, you call Gus Petch

Christ, you seem to be
taking it pretty good

<i>I seen 'em come in here, weep and
wail like Baptists at a funeral</i>

<i>Like they hired me to prove
their husbands weren't foolin' around</i>

<i>Don't get me wrong, Mr, um...
Petch</i>

Gus Petch

<i>Whilst I don't find this terribly amusing,
I am delighted that you found this material</i>

This is going to be
my passport to wealth,

independence and freedom

Sounds like to me
you gon' nail his ass

Honey? Honey!

<i>Rex, get away from the door</i>

Honey?

My key doesn't work

Can we talk about this?

Rex, get away
from the door

Oh, look, I know
that you're upset, honey

Rex, for your own safety,
get away from the door

I don't like having
to set the dogs on you

Oh, for crying out loud,
if we could... Dogs?

Yes, dogs

<i>I wanted some security
since I'll be living here alone</i>

Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized
discussion about this? Our lawyers can

Aaah!

<i>You have a discovery hearing at 5:30
for the Maxine Gopnick case</i>

Discovery? Gopnick?
And a Lance Kelso called

He read your article about
palimony settlements Lance Kelso

in same-sex
partnerships

and would like to schedule
an appointment Same-sex

Arthur Yardumian and his tax attorney want
to reschedule their caucus for tomorrow

Yardumian? Arthur had to fly to
Atlanta for a deadbeat dad hearing

Atlanta? And your 10:30
is here Rex Rexroth

Rex Rexroth?
Real estate He's okay

Mr Rexroth

Uh, call me Rex
Please

Miles Massey
Please sit Relax

Consider this office your office, your haven,
your war room for the duration of the campaign

Thank you

Now, sir

tell me your troubles

Well

my wife has me
between a rock and a hard place

That's her job
You should respect that

When I first met Marylin,
we were crazy about each other

Not emotionally, of course Just, we
couldn't keep our hands off each other

<i>But then...
then...</i>

Time marches on

Ardor cools
Yeah

<i>So, um, we had an understanding</i>

<i>Whereby?
We could see other people</i>

Has Mrs Rexroth pursued the opportunities
implicit in your arrangement?

Uh, I can... I can only assume...

Not in court, you can't

Has she retained counsel?
I don't know

She has rottweilers
Not a good sign

And have you yourself exploited
your understood freedom?

There's a lady

A- Ayoung lady

<i>She lets me be myself
Of course</i>

And your wife is aware
and/or has evidence?

Video
Hah!

To cut to the chase,
forensically speaking,

is there a prenup?

"The fault, dear Brutus, lies not
in our stars, but in ourselves"

Let me ask you this...
What kind of a settlement do you seek?

What are, for you,
the parameters of the possible?

Well, that's the problem

I can't afford to give her anything

Nothing?

<i>Yeah, I know that sounds
a little rough, but listen,</i>

<i>I'm about to close a deal
to develop some mini-malls</i>

I'm mortgaged up to my heinie

If this deal goes south, I am ruined
I will lose millions

So you propose

that, in spite of demonstrable
infidelity on your part,

your unoffending wife should be
tossed out on her ear?

Well, is that possible?

It's a challenge

Why don't you come out to Malibu
and see my new beach house tomorrow

I didn't know Dmitri
had a beach house

Neither did I until my lawyer
found it Quite a paper trail

He had it in the dog's name Oh

<i>Well, tomorrow won't work
I'm having a body wrap</i>

<i>How's Wednesday? Hair
appointment in the morning</i>

Afternoon? Shrink How's your Thursday?

I'm having facial injections
That kills Friday and Saturday

Botox?
Butt fat

Does that really work?
You tell me

Hello, darlings
Mwah!

Mwah!

So, you and Rex are...

Well, as my private investigator put it,
we're gonna nail his ass

I've been trying to nail George's
ass for years, but he is so careful

<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

Are you all right, Claire?

Down the wrong pipe

So, who's your lawyer?
Freddy Bender

I have an appointment this afternoon
with Rex and his schnauzer

<i>So, who's Rex's guy?
Miles Massey</i>

Miles Massey?
Of Massey, Myerson?

<i>Do you know him?
By reputation</i>

And, Marylin, he's no schnauzer

He got Phyllis Rumsey that
cute little island of George's

George was so impressed, he hired
him when he divorced his second

Muriel Rumsey
Who's she?

Now?
Night manager at McDonald's

<i>But, Marylin,
do we have a man for you</i>

Thorstenson Gieselensen

He just separated from his third
He's in fish

<i>He is fish
Well, he's tuna</i>

Ladies, I'm not seeing anyone
until I've finished nailing Rex's ass

<i>But, Marylin,
this man is tuna</i>

Sarah, one husband at a time

I'll do the talking

I know you'll be tempted to chime in, but remember
that you're in an emotionally vulnerable state

<i>I'm the professional
Oh</i>

Okay

Freddy

Freddy Bender,
this is Rex Rexroth

<i>And you are
the lovely Marylin</i>

Please, Ms Rexroth

And you must be Mr Massey

Please, Miles Sit

Sit down

Freddy, I was sorry to hear
about the Goldberger award

<i>Pastry?</i>

We did very well

Not to worry, Mrs Rexroth
You're ably represented

I'm sure Freddy's just too modest to tell
you he used to clerk for Clarence Thomas

Pastry?
Going begging

Don't try to bait me, Miles

If you have a proposal to make,
let's hear it

Well, at this point my client is still
prepared to consider reconciliation

My client's ruled that out

My client is prepared to entertain an amicable
dissolution to the marriage without prejudice

That's a fart in a stiff wind

My client proposes
a 30-day cooling-off period

My client feels
sufficiently dispassionate

My client asks that you not initiate proceedings
pending his setting certain affairs in order

What's so goddamn funny?

Please, let me handle this

All right, so much for the
ice-breakers What are you after, Freddy?

My client is prepared to settle
for 50 percent of the marital assets

Why only 50, Freddy?
Why not a hundred?

<i>While we're dreaming,
why not 150?</i>

<i>- Are you familiar with Kershner?
Kershner does not apply</i>

<i>Bring this to trial,
we'll see if Kershner applies</i>

<i>What's Kershner?
Please, let me handle this</i>

<i>- Kershner was in Kentucky
Kershner was in Kentucky?</i>

<i>- Kershner was in Kentucky
All right, Freddy, forget Kershner What's your bottom line?</i>

Primary residence,
30 percent of remaining assets

<i>What, are you nuts?
Have you forgotten Kershner?</i>

<i>Freddy, it's a negotiation</i>

<i>See you at the preliminary</i>

<i>Freddy,
we're all friends here</i>

It's a negotiation Hey, uh...

Freddy!

<i>Fine We'll eat the pastry</i>

I thought that went well

<i>Don't cry out loud</i>

<i>Oh, yeah</i>

<i>Gus, you outdid yourself</i>

<i>Mm-hmm
Hear, hear</i>

<i>Mm-hmm, that's cool
Very cool</i>

<i>Let's go back
to the football game!</i>

Oh, kiss my ass, now It's
halftime, man This is some good shit

I'm 'bout to nail his ass
right here

<i>Gussy, go back to
the Rabinowitz tape again</i>

Hold on, now Here come the good part
She 'bout to take off her panties

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, come on

<i>Gus?
Mm-hmm... Yeah?</i>

<i>It's Miles Massey
Uh, take a number</i>

<i>It's about
a job tonight!</i>

Goddamn it

Aah! Aah! Did you see
that? Oh, come on, man!

<i>Here we are</i>

Ms Rexroth, I am so delighted
you decided to come

Well, I must admit
I was curious

Something to start?
Some wine, perhaps?

Red?
French?

Bordeaux?
Chateau Margaux?

'57?
'59

'54

<i>Mmm, Mr Massey
Good, sir</i>

Your husband had told me you were the
most beautiful woman that he'd ever met

<i>I didn't expect the most
beautiful woman I'd ever met</i>

"Dismiss your vows,
your feigned tears, your flattery,

for where a heart is hard
they make no battery"

"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

Now, you didn't ask me here
to pick me up

You could be disbarred for that

Maybe I'm reckless

What was your performance about this
afternoon? What did your lawyer say?

Oh, Freddy thinks you're a buffoon

He says
you've been too successful,

you're bored, complacent,
and you're on your way down

But you don't think so
How do you know?

Why would you be here?
Why did you ask me?

Can't I be curious?
About what?

<i>Do you ever answer questions? Do you?</i>

I'll have the tournedoes of beef
The lady will have the same Thank you

Thank you, sir

I assume you're a carnivore

Oh, Mr Massey, you have no idea

Miles, please

Tell me more about yourself

All right, Miles

Let me tell you
everything that you need to know

You may think you're tough,
but I eat men like you for breakfast

<i>I've invested five good years
in my marriage to Rex,</i>

and I've nailed his ass
fair and square

Now I'm going to have it
stuffed, mounted

and have my lady friends come over
and throw darts at it

Man-hater, huh?

People don't go on safaris
'cause they hate animals

<i>So it's just for the hunt,
with the trophy at the end</i>

No Nothing so frivolous

This divorce means money

Money means independence

That's what I'm after

What are you after, Miles?

Well, I'm a lot like you

Just looking for
an ass to mount

Well, don't look at mine

Yeah

<i>Oy vey</i>

I got ya See this?

Yeah?

Uh, I'll just have
a, um, salad, please

Um, baby field greens

What did you call me?

Uh, no, I-I...
I- I didn't call you anything

<i>You want a salad? Yeah Do you...
Do you have a, uh, green salad?</i>

What the fuck color
would it be?

Why are we eating here?

<i>What's his problem?</i>

Just bring him an iceberg lettuce and a mealy
tomato wedge smothered with French dressing

And for you?
Ham sandwich on stale rye bread Lots of mayo, easy on the ham

Slaw cup?
What the hell

Hello, Marge
How are you, Gus?

I'm all right

Okay, now, I Minoxed
her address book

Don't call me anymore
for this penny-ante shit

<i>I shoot action
Me and the Ikegami, Jack</i>

Thank you, Gus

And those rottweilers
were a menace, man

I told you she had dogs

<i>Yeah You ain't tell me
they had a hard-on for anus Africanus</i>

Gus, did you see any evidence,

any telltale signs

<i>of indiscretion
on the part of Mrs Rexroth?</i>

What are you talkin' 'bout,
"telltale signs"?

Look, I see an ass, I nail it

I don't sneak around
sniffin' at sheets

Goddamn it,
I'm Gus Petch!

Couldn't you
be disbarred for that?

No, I don't think so
Maybe if I'd had the patty melt

You had a guy break into her house
and photograph her address book

No, Wrigley, I happened
to let a man know

that I was interested in her
address book... that's not criminal

I also happened to let him know
that I was taking her out to dinner

That's not a crime either

No, I don't see myself
as culpable in any sense

You, on the other hand,
could be disbarred

for developing and examining
these photos of her address book,

but that doesn't
really concern me

Right

Who are you looking for?
Tenzing Norgay

Tenzing Norgay

That's someone she slept with

I doubt it Tenzing Norgay was the Sherpa
that helped Edmund Hillary climb Mt Everest

And Marylin knows him

<i>No, you idiot Not the Tenzing
Norgay Her Tenzing Norgay</i>

I'm not sure
that I actually follow that

Few great accomplishments are
achieved single-handedly, Wrigley

Most have their Norgays

Marylin Rexroth is even now
climbing her Everest

I wanna find her Norgay

But how do you determine
which of the people on here are...

How do you spot a Norgay?
Yeah

You start with the people
with the funny names

Oyez, oyez Family Court of the Fifth
District of Los Angeles County now in session

The Honorable Marva
Munson presiding All rise

Have you sat before her
before?

No No, the judge sits first
Then we sit

Well, have you sat
after her before?

Sat after her before? You mean,
have we argued before her before?

The judge sits in judgment
The counsel argues before the judge

So, have you argued
before her before?

<i>Before her before, or before
she sat before? Before her before</i>

I said, before her before No,
you said before she sat before

I did at first, but...
Look, don't argue

<i>I'm not I'm... No, you
don't argue We argue</i>

Counsel argues
You appear

<i>Thejudge sits
Then you sit</i>

<i>- Or you stand in contempt
And then we argue</i>

The counsel argues
Which you've done before

Which we've done before
Ah

But not before her

There it is! I got it!

I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Enough, I say!

I'm gon' nail yo' ass! Yeah!

Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
A silly misunderstanding...

Get that thing off me!

Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

<i>I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

Devastated

Simply devastated

Thank you, Mrs Rexroth

<i>Mr Massey, any questions?</i>

"Dismiss your vows,

<i>"your feigned tears, your flattery,</i>

<i>for where a heart is hard

Mrs Rexroth, do you know those
lines? Objection, Your Honor

Grounds?
Uh, poetry recitation

Let me rephrase
Mrs Rexroth

how high is that wall
around your heart?

Your Honor, this is harassment,

and, frankly,
it's still a little, uh, arty-farty

Rephrase Mrs Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Yes

Of course

With Rex

And you've always loved him?

"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

S...

So it's your sworn testimony
that you have loved Rex Rexroth

since first you met?

Yes

Thank you

No further questions,

<i>Did you sleep with him?</i>

Don't be a fool

Shush, Elsbieta
Shush-shush-shush-shush

Baron von Espy,
what is your profession?

Silly man I am a baron

Yes, but do you not
also hold a day job?

Paying job
A, uh, a square job

Well, one has to live

I am the concierge
of Les Pantalons Rouges

at Bad-Gadesbourg
in the canton of Uri

And what does that job entail?

I satisfy such requests
as the clientele may present

<i>Towels, ice, et cetera?</i>

We have bellmen for that
No, no, no

Such requests that, were you at home,
you would address not to your valet

but to your majordomo

Shush, poochy-chow

I see Baron, do you
recognize that woman?

<i>Ah, cher Marylin
But of course</i>

Look who is here Hi!

And she was a guest
of the Red Trousers?

<i>Oh, many times,</i>

<i>for relaxing
and making Alpine recreation</i>

Mm-hmm I am curious about
her visit of five years ago

January 1998

Can you remember any specific
request she made at that time?

Yes, I can
At what, at that time, did she tell you she required?

She said that she required

a husband!

<i>Do you want some bones? Huh?
Does Elsbieta want some bones?</i>

<i>Has anyone any bones?</i>

Does anyone have any bones?
B... Uh, bones? Dog candies?

No, they are not candies Milk-Bones
Hard, crunchy bones for the teeth

<i>Uh, hard, uh...</i>

<i>We'll attend to the dog later</i>

<i>Now, Baron...</i>

Where were we?

"She said that
she required a husband

"Oh, do you want some bones?

<i>"Does Elsbieta want some bones?</i>

Has anyone any bones?
Hard, crunchy bones for the..."

Right

Now, a husband
That's an unusual request

Did she specify what kind
of a husband she was looking for?

Stop him
Objection

Grounds?
Uh hearsay

It's not secondhand, Your Honor This is direct
testimony about the baron's own conversation

I'm going to allow it
Yeah

She said she wanted
a very rich husband

She wanted to know the businesses and
the wealths-s... the wealths-s-s...

Can I say this?
Wealths of our various eligible guests

And did she have
any other specifications?

Objection, Your Honor Inflammatory
What's good for the gander, Your Honor

Is this a legal argument... "What's good for the gander"?
You got to play your tape, Freddy

<i>Mr Massey has a point there
I'm going to allow it</i>

Were there any other
specifications?

<i>She "specificated" a silly man</i>

<i>Objection, Your Honor!
I'm going to allow it</i>

She "specificated" a man who,
though clever at making money,

<i>would be easily duped
and controlled</i>

Objection, Your Honor Shut
up, Freddy She's allowing it

<i>She "specificated"a man
with a wandering pee-pee</i>

<i>How you say? Aphilanderer whose affairs
would be transparent to the world</i>

Objection, Your Honor!

Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold

<i>until such time
as she might choose to, uh...</i>

<i>We would say, "faire un coup
de marteau sur des fesses "</i>

You would say,
"make hammer on his fanny"

<i>- Your Honor, Objection! L-Irrelevant!
I'm going to allow it!</i>

Tell us, Baron...
Did you introduce her to such a man?

Sir, I am the concierge!

And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

I introduced her

<i>to that silly man</i>

<i>Your Honor, objection!</i>

Let the record show that the baron
has identified Rex Rexroth as the silly man!

<i>I did it! It was I!</i>

<i>I introduced her
to that silly man!</i>

You son of a bitch! - The
red-faced angry one I introduced them!

<i>Absolument!
I did it! It was I!</i>

I just love trains!

I love trains!
If you please, sir!

<i>I'm not sick!
You're the one who's sick!</i>

No...
If you please...

Not the larynx!

Objection, Your Honor!
Strangling the witness!

I'm going to allow it

Well, I think it stinks

They left you with nothing

Makes you wonder about
the entire legal system,

like Rodney what's-his-name

They bought
Massey's argument

<i>If I lied or cheated
and was with Rex only for his money,</i>

then he shouldn't have to
give me any

Well, that makes no sense Why else
would you put in all those years?

Oooh!

Are you all right,
Sarah?

Yeah
Wh-What is it?

Peptic ulcer

I have medication, but I can't
take it before elective surgery

You shouldn't be
living here alone, Sarah

My goddamn husbands
gave me the ulcer

But a bottle of Bromo
can't love you back

Yeah

It's a catch-22

I have to admit,
I don't like living alone

I mean, do I need 46 rooms?

You could see people

It's risky Palimony

Son of a bitch Marvin Mitchelson

I'm telling you, honey, getting laid
is financial Russian roulette

<i>Maybe I shouldjust tear it all down,
build a cottage</i>

More landscaping

Well, with my money,
I can't afford to be fooling around

<i>Besides, I have you</i>

It'll be fun...
just the girls

<i>Well, thanks, Sarah, but I can't
sleep on your couch forever</i>

I'm going to marry again,

nail the guy's ass good

And this time
there'll be no Puffy von Espy

Knock knock

<i>Excuse me Mr Donaly?</i>

<i>Mr Donaly?</i>

Mr Donaly, excuse me

<i>You are Donovan Donaly?</i>

<i>I'm in a meeting
Mr Donaly</i>

I need a name

And, of course, we will have to litigate
Sentence, paragraph

Naturally, the first concern
for both parties

is the welfare
of little WendellJunior

Nevertheless, we do question whether the
continuing expenses for his special ed classes

are truly justified,
given the great strides...

<i>Mr Massey, the senior partner

<i>Fourteen summaryjudgments sought</i>

Mr Massey?

Please, no calls

I'm feeling a little fragile

I'm sorry, Mr Massey, but I felt certain you'd
want to know Marylin Rexroth wants to see you

Marylin... Uh, uh, uh, w...
Uh, when did she, uh...

She's here now

Is she armed?
Give me a minute

Marylin

How nice of you to...

Marylin?

Shame on you

Marylin

What a lovely surprise

Marylin, what a pl...

Who the hell are you?
Hello, Miles

So nice of you to see us

May I introduce Howard
D Doyle of Doyle Oil

I'm goddamn pleased
to meet you

Marylin here, she says you're
the best Says you're aces

Well, thank you, Mr, uh...

Uh, any... any relation
toJohn D Doyle of Doyle Oil?

Oh, you must be talkin' about
Grandpa John My papa's John D too

The Deuce, we called him You
know, kinda the rebel of the family

But they knocked off that wholeJohn D
routine when they christened Yours Truly

Grandpa nearly had a stroke

He did have a stroke, but that was
later, during the labor activity in '52

The government stepped in Mm-hmm Uh...

They called it mediation
Well...

He called it
incipient communism

Of course, that's when
he had his stroke

Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog

He lingered in a vegetative state for
years... Well, that is fascinating, Mr Doyle

What say we have a seat?
A seat?

Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long

Kinda hit-and-run shoppin', you know
Take no prisoners

Forced march kind of thing
My God, my dogs are barkin'

We started out at this li'I ol' place right
off of Wilshire... It's been quite a day

Had pewter things

But anyway, Miles, I know you're busy and you
charge by the hour, so I'll get straight to the point

Howard D and I
are planning to marry

Well...

<i>Well, I suppose that congratulations
are in order Well, thank you, Miles</i>

<i>You know, the urge to wedlock and form a lastin'monogamous
bond sanctified by ritual, it's pert-near universal</i>

<i>As a matter of fact, it might be of some
interest to you, bein'in a related business...</i>

Even your indigenous Americans...
Uh, I believe it was your Cree... used to...

Howard and I are here because I've
learned, through bitter experience,

that when it comes to matrimony
and law, you are the very best

<i>And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage</i>

ended in an unjustified stain

upon my reputation

My motives were impugned

I was slandered in court

<i>I was painted a harlot</i>

Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot

Oh, yes, honey

<i>So it's my desire to remove
any trace of suspicion</i>

from the mind
of my dear Howard Doyle

Oh, honey, come on, now

I wish to execute
a prenuptial agreement

<i>And I'm dead-set against it
I mean, just anti the whole deal</i>

Howard's lawyers prefer it

I insist upon it

Oh, damn lawyers Uh, no offense to the
present company or anything, you know

Now, is it my understanding that the
Massey prenup has never been penetrated?

That is correct

Not to blow my own horn, but they devote
an entire semester to it at Harvard Law

<i>They got a hell of a school up there,
ain't no doubt about it</i>

<i>We donated that Doyle building
up there here a while back Mm-hmm</i>

Now, I myself went to Texas A&M
I'm an Aggie

Business?
Tight end

And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense

See, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

<i>it allows me to buttonhook and, you know, do a
down-and-in, up-and-out and different things...</i>

<i>post pattern
every now and then</i>

Your tight ends
don't generally run a post

<i>But if the QB calls it,
hell, I'm ready</i>

<i>Interrupt for a second?
Yeah</i>

<i>I wanna make sure that you both
understand what it is you're asking</i>

<i>The Massey prenup provides that in the
event of a dissolution of the marriage,</i>

for any reason,

both parties will leave it with what
they brought in and earned during

No one can profit
from the marriage

The prenup protects
the wealthier party

<i>Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck</i>

Not a hell of a lot
of romance in that

No, sir, there is not
No romance

More to the point,
no wriggle room

<i>So, are we sure</i>

that this is what we want?

Absolutely

It's my gift to Howard,

for his peace of mind,

whether or not he's worried
about it at this moment

Oh, honey pie,
do I look worried?

Excuse me, Mr Doyle

Could I just borrow your
charming fiancée for a moment?

Well, okay
You gon' leave a deposit?

What are you up to?

Something
you won't understand, Miles

Howard and I are very much in love

I don't know what you're thinking, but I have to
warn you, the Massey prenup has never been penetrated

You sign the prenup,
you can't get his money

Thanks for the professional help

Marylin, think of me for a moment

not as an attorney but as a friend

Does that mean you won't be
charging us for the hour?

Dump him
You can't nail his ass

Is that all?

No, that's not all

I could have you disbarred for that

It was worth it

A romantic divorce attorney

You fascinate me

<i>I'll get right on it
I'll whip something up</i>

<i>All right Thank you</i>

<i>How's Lionel?
He's fine</i>

He asked me to deliver the keynote address
at this year's convention in Vegas

That's quite an honor

<i>I suppose
On top of a great victory</i>

What was that?

"What was that"?

Um, Rex Rexroth?

He kept everything? You win? No
compromise? Isn't that what you wanted?

Oh, good God, Miles
What are you looking for?

I don't know

Okay, I won

What then?

How many cases
has Herb Myerson won?

The old man? More than anybody
He's a legend And look at him

He's 87 years old, he's the first
one into the office in the morning

No home life
Who needs a home when you have a colostomy bag?

She can't really love this dope,
can she?

Who? Uh, who loves who?

Marylin Rexroth

She signed a prenup
for an oil millionaire

A Massey prenup?

Yeah

<i>Well, then she is not
after his money</i>

Only love is in mind
if the Massey is signed

April

Come she will

When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain

<i>Nay, she will stay</i>

<i>A- resting in my arms again</i>

What the hell's
wrong with you?

April

Come she will

Thank you for coming
to this celebration

of the love between our two friends,
Marylin and Howard

In today's cynical world,

it's so hard to take
that great leap of faith

aboard the ship of love and caring

But today Marylin and Howard
are taking that leap

and telling us, their friends,

<i>that they do believe,
that they do have faith,</i>

<i>that they do love</i>

Do you, Howard Drexler Doyle,

take Marylin to be your shipmate
on this journey through life,

<i>through gale and doldrum,
seas choppy, wild and calm?</i>

Yes, I do, Father Scott

And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take
Howard to be your shipmate and companion

<i>to ports of every clime,</i>

<i>Be it in first class or steerage?</i>

I do

<i>Then, by the power vested in me
by the State of California,</i>

<i>and as captain
of the good ship Amore Veritas,</i>

I now pronounce you man and wife

What do you think?

<i>- What are they, ladles?
Berry spoons</i>

Spoons?
Berry spoons

<i>Everybody has spoons And
nobody needs berry spoons</i>

Everybody eats berries
Who are you, Pollyanna?

<i>Hey, everybody! Folks! Hey,
y'all! Where'd you see 'em at?</i>

<i>A Martha Stewart catalog
right next to the silver napkin rings?</i>

<i>I need your attention for a
minute Stadium seat ass-warmers?</i>

Dear God, Wrigley, how many cockamamie
personal possessions do we have to amass...

Why so angry?

Now, I know it's not common practice for the groom
to give his bride a gift on their weddin' day,

<i>but ever since
I met Marylin there</i>

I can't seem to quit
givin' her things

And I don't wanna stop
'cause it feels so durn good!

<i>Chow Sing, bring that barbecue sauce
over here, little buddy</i>

There you go

Put that thing on my neck now

Now, honey,
it's like the padre said

I want love and trust between us

<i>Love and trust
and not a thing else</i>

And this here deed
that I'm fixin' to perform...

Well, honey, let me just, uh...

You see this?

<i>This is for you, darlin;</i>

<i>This here is for you</i>

This here is for you, baby

<i>Ever'last little speck of it</i>

I love you

I mean, I love you
like a son of a bitch!

<i>I trust you!</i>

<i>This here is for you, baby
Brilliant!</i>

Baby, this is for you

<i>What is it?
I really love you</i>

It's the prenup

I love her!

<i>I trust her!</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
It's the prenup!</i>

<i>I trust her!
Brilliant!</i>

You look beautiful

Ladies,
if you'll excuse us

We have to talk

<i>I would like to offer
my congratulations</i>

It was a beautiful gesture
of Howard's

Well, Howard
is a beautiful person

A diamond in the rough

And I have a feeling that
someday soon

you'll be taking that diamond
and leaving the rough

In a month or so, once I've established
that I've tried to make the marriage work

May I offer my services?
Oh, thanks

But no

No, I'm retaining Freddy Bender

Poor Freddy He was awfully blue
after my last divorce

Well, I admire your loyalty

To lawyers, anyway

I guess without the prenup
it's something even Freddy could manage

But how did you
get Howard to do it?

It felt like it was his idea

Surely, Mr Massey,
you've addressed enough juries

to appreciate
the power of suggestion

<i>Mmm</i>

<i>Wish I was a Kellogg's Corn Flake</i>

<i>Look, now that the marriage
is winding down,</i>

have dinner with me

No

No, nothing doing until
the ink is dry on the settlement

Oh, this'll be no settlement

If I know Marylin Rexroth, this'll be
nothing short of a complete and total

annihilation

You're gonna win
Excuse me?

I can always tell, going
to Vegas, who's gonna win

Well, thanks,
but I'm going on business

I always win

<i>Yeah</i>

<i>Yeah</i>

<i>You know why I hate this town,
Wrigley?</i>

You see, people get to Las Vegas, and all of a
sudden, the rules of the moral universe don't apply

When God is dead,
all things are possible

I saw an ad in the paper:

"No-fault divorce...
two-week divorce without a lawyer"

Made me sick to my stomach
"No-fault divorce"

Good God
Talk about your oxymoron

What's the world comin' to?
One man can only do so much

One man... What
are you talkin' about?

<i>- Freddy
I had lunch with Freddy Bender yesterday</i>

He tells me that Marylin Rexroth-Doyle
is now richer than Croesus

Ah, yes, but is she richer
than Mrs Croesus?

She could buy and sell
you 10 times over She...

<i>- My God, is that her?
Mmm</i>

Freddy said she was flying in with him
Celebrating, I guess

I'm fascinated by that creature
Richer than me, huh?

<i>Well, she deserves every penny</i>

<i>And now she's single again
Excuse me</i>

No You should stay away
from her, Miles

Recite your keynote address
Take a cold shower

You're looking well,
Marylin Hello, Miles

Obscene wealth becomes you

<i>I should've known you'd be here Be here?</i>

I'm the keynote speaker
Oh, how nice for you

"Nailing Your Spouse's Assets"
Excuse me?

My speech
Oh!

Oh, I'm sure you'll
bring the house down

It's an easy crowd

At this point, I would think you're probably
the only person that I can't teach anything to

Really?
Mmm

Now, correct me,
but since by now the ink must be dry,

I believe
I have the right to collect

On? You promised to have dinner
with me once you were free

I said I wouldn't whilst I wasn't,
which implies no promise once I am

Noted
Let me rephrase

I would be delighted...
honored, really... if you'd...

Howard!
Ow! Howard!

Howard!

You named him after
your ex I'm sentimental

Well, I'm free this evening, so I
suppose a little dinner would do no harm

<i>Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,
1990, sir</i>

Yes Thank you
I'll take care of it

Marylin, this is
a moment to savor

Yes, we were adversaries,

but we were also professionals

So let us raise a glass
to friendship

To victory

So, how does it feel?

Sorry?
Victory Independence

Oh, um...

Well, frankly, Miles...
It's not everything you'd hoped for?

I know the feeling

Independence
Two-edged sword

My friend... My best friend...
Sarah Sorkin?

Sarah Battista-O'Flanagan-Sorkin?

<i>The O'Flanagan settlement?</i>

Ahh
Hmm

Huh
Anyway, three fine settlements

More money
than she could ever hope to spend

<i>Yes
Her vaunted independence</i>

Don't tell me She sits around the house, afraid to
see people, afraid to put her portfolio into play

And only a peptic ulcer
to keep her warm at night

Yes

There's a certain point
when you've achieved your goals

You realize that
you're still not satisfied

Yes

We should order

You know,
I'm not really hungry

Neither am I

Shh

<i>1,800 billable hours</i>

Hello? Marylin?

Sarah Sorkin just died!

Marylin!

Her ulcer

Infection
Yes

Miles?
Yes, Marylin?

She was alone

She'd been dead for two days
before her Pilates instructor found her

Marylin, listen to me

No arguments No discussions I'll have
Wrigley meet us at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather

The vows are from an Arapaho dawn greeting ceremony

The music is Simon and Garfunkel
And this is the Massey prenup

You the two gettin' married?
Mr MacKinnon here will be officiating

Sorry Short notice
Pen

Marylin, you're welcome
to examine this

This is the Massey prenup

As you know, it's ironclad
We tried to reach Freddy Bender

We tried to reach Freddy, to have him here for your
protection, but we couldn't find him I couldn't get him

Are you two here to get married
or to bullshit?

So you can't hope to benefit from the marriage?
Not in any way

And my wealth is completely...
completely protected?

As if a lead veil
had been drawn across it

Do you still want to
marry me? More than ever

Are ya rentin' kilts?

Do you, Miles Longfellow Massey,

of Massey, Myerson, Sloan
and Gurolnick, LLP,

<i>take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle
to be your lawful wedded wife?</i>

I do Yes I do I do

Let me finish Jesus, have
you never been married before?

<i>To have and to hold, to love and
to cherish, till death do you part?</i>

I do

<i>And do you,
Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle,</i>

take Miles Longfellow Massey
to be your lawful wedded husband,

<i>to have and to hold, to love and
to cherish, till death do you part?</i>

I do
I now pronounce you man and wife

<i>I'll take care of you later</i>

No, no, no, no, no No
This is all wrong Wha...

Is it the kilt?

Do you love me?
More than anything

Can I trust you?
Yes You can trust me

Darling, you're exposed

A sitting duck

I hereby declare the 12th Congress
of the National Organization

<i>- of Matrimonial Attorneys
Nationwide open</i>

As our first order of business, it is a privilege
to call to the podium our keynote speaker

From the Los Angeles firm
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan and Gurolnick,

a man whose name is synonymous
with bitter disputes and big awards,

Miles Massey

Thank you, Branco

In the world of...

In the world of matrimonial law,
there are...

In the world of matrimonial law,
there are multiple tactics...

Friends,

this morning I stand before you
a very different Miles Massey

than the one that
addressed you last year

on the disposition of marital assets
following murder/suicide

<i>I wish to talk to you today
not about technical matters oflaw</i>

I wish to talk to you
about something more important

I wish to talk to you
from the heart

because today
for the first time in my life,

I stand before you naked

vulnerable

And in love

Love

It's a word
we matrimonial lawyers avoid

<i>Funny, isn't it? We're frightened of
this emotion, which is, in a sense,</i>

the seed of our livelihood

Well, today Miles Massey
is here to tell you

that love need
cause us no fear

Love need cause us no shame

Love is

good

Love is good

I am, of course, aware that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism

<i>Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference</i>

and hides all human feeling

<i>Well, I'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us</i>

in fact destroys

Destroys love,
destroys our clients,

and, ultimately,
destroys ourselves

<i>Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting</i>

because their flame of love
is guttering and threatens to die,

do we seek to extinguish that flame
so that we can sift

<i>through the smoldering wreckage
for our paltry reward,</i>

or do we fan
this precious flame,

this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

<i>Do we counsel fear or trust?</i>

Do we seek to destroy or build?

<i>Do we meet our clients'problems
with cynicism</i>

or with love?

The choice is, of course,
each of ours

For my part, I've made the leap of love,
and there's no going back

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the last time I will address you</i>

as the president of NOMAN...
or as a member

<i>I intend to devote myself
to pro bono work in East Los Angeles</i>

or one of those other...

God bless you all

I love you, man

So, Wrigley, I'm gonna be relinquishing
my partnership in Massey, Myerson

If you'd care to join me in my
new endeavor, I'd be delighted

Of course, I can't offer you the same kind of
financial remuneration you've grown accustomed to,

but the work'll have
to serve as its own reward

Barkeep, we'll have two of your
finest scotches That's the, uh...

<i>- I propose a toast Barkeep!
That's... That's the soap that used to belong to, uh...</i>

Now, you'll be serving in a junior
capacity, of course Donovan Donaly

<i>- Miles, that's, uh... that's, uh... uh...
It'll be a small operation, a boutique</i>

Let me tell you what they
called me in medical school

The... I don't see why my
leadership skills should...

<i>Howard?
Mackenzie the Mechanical Marvel</i>

<i>It's Howard
You see, I have no nerves</i>

He's not an oil tycoon
An actor

Doctor, this is highly unusual

<i>So Marylin married a soap actor</i>

<i>So she's...she's poor</i>

Get yourself some clean scrubs
and have them prepare the OR

Well, thank God you have the prenup
I have no prenup

You have no prenup
I have no prenup

You have no prenup

Thanks

Okay

Marylin?
Oh, hello, Miles

Going back to LA?
Yes

Look, Miles, I think it's only fair
to warn you that after a decent interval,

I intend to have Freddy
seek an injunction

that would forbid you to approach
within 500 feet of my house

You mean, my house Oh, I believe the
residence will be part of the settlement

Marylin, didn't last night
mean anything to you?

<i>Oh Well, about as much as it'll
mean to you... half of your net worth</i>

Oh, Miles, you'll always be
my favorite husband

But no more sentiment,
darling

<i>I really have to be going</i>

The dog's rented

You didn't win

Excuse me?

I can always tell, comin'
back from Vegas, who didn't win

You're right

<i>But</i>

you're going
through with it?

<i>Yes</i>

I just felt so sorry for him
for a minute there

At the preliminary hearing,
he just looked so beaten

Well, he was beaten, fair
and square I know, but...

Oh, their pathetic look

It's what they all fall back on
when they don't have a prenup

Just stay strong
until the divorce is final

Relax
and enjoy your pool

Do you think he's
eating enough? Marylin!

<i>This woman has humbled,</i>

Shamed and disgraced
the entire firm

<i>- Yes, Herb
Counselor</i>

this firm deals in power

This firm deals in perception

This firm cannot prosper

<i>nor long endure
if it is perceived to be</i>

dancing to the music
of a hurdy-gurdy!

It's just...

Herb, for the first time
in my career,

I don't know what to do

I'm a patsy
I'm a sittin' duck I'm lost

Lost?

I'll tell you what you can do
You can act like a man

And let me
tell you something, smart guy

<i>You thought you had it
all figured out</i>

Trust Marriage

All your goddamn love, love, love!

<i>Now, you listen to me I'm gonna
talk to you about the goddamn law</i>

We serve the law!

We honor the law!

<i>And sometimes, Counselor,
we obey the law</i>

<i>But, Counselor,</i>

This is not one of those times

Are you WheezyJoe?

Which of youse is Smith?

Well, uh, we're here
representing Mr Smith

on a matter of some delicacy

Who's the pigeon?
The what?

Who you want me to kill?
Yes Well, we would like you...

Mr Smith would like you
to neutralize...

<i>terminate...
render unto a state of...</i>

so that
she isn't so much, uh... uh...

Breathing
Yes A business associate

by the name of Marylin
Rexroth-Doyle-Massey... Smith... Massey

<i>Is that one person?</i>

I have some photos here

of Miss Rexroth, and, um, that's
the address that she's staying at

That is Mr Smith's address...
Massey's... Smith...

It's Mr Smith's address, although
Mr Smith is not directly involved

<i>Because of an impending legal matter, we need
this to happen within a certain time frame</i>

On an expedited basis
You're in a rush

We're not in a rush
Mr Smith is

Sh... Sh... Sh... She won't...
She won't suffer, will she?

<i>Not unless you pay extra</i>

<i>Oh, I've been workin'
on the railroad</i>

All the livelong day

I've been workin' on the railroad

Just to pass the time away

Can't you hear the whistle blowing

Rise up so early in the morn
Toot-toot!

Whistle's goin' "toot-toot"

What's the matter, Rexie?

Hello?

Yes, he's here
One moment, please

Miles

It's for you

Hello? Yes?

What?

<i>I see</i>

My God

What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer

<i>He was Rex Rexroth's
personal attorney</i>

Yes?

<i>What do you mean, he was?</i>

Rex had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting

He's dead

Well, I'm very sorry to hear that,

but you two weren't close,
were you?

Marvin said that Rex's will was
four years old Never redrafted it

<i>He was stinkin'rich
Yes?</i>

Everything goes to Marylin

She's not poor
She's richer than you

She is exposed No prenup
She's a sitting duck

She's a sitting duck Can't
kill her No need Mm-hmm

No It would be pointless
She's exposed It's pointless

<i>Exposed Why kill the only woman you've
ever loved when she's the richer party?</i>

She's rich And I love her
Don't need to kill her

Ah
What? Ah!

You've reached WheezyJoe
What do you want? Joe!

Hi, it's Miles Smith...
Mr Smith... calling to say

on behalf of myself,
that it is... No-go

uh, no-go
concerning Marylin

<i>I'm speaking with no knowledge
This is what Mr Smith wants</i>

This is what I want

I am Mr Smith
Thank you

<i>That was good</i>

You think I'm protected?
Ehh... You...

<i>Am I protected?
I think it would hold up</i>

Marylin
Yes, yes Marylin

What do we do? What if he's on his way there?
Yes Oh!

If he's on his way there...
Oh, no! Marylin!

Get her out and buy some time
Buy some time!

Hello?

Marylin, you must
leave the house immediately

It's imperative that you
leave the house Hello, Miles

Hello, dear
Now, Miles, pending final settlement,

you know that I'm entitled to use the
house No, no, no! You don't understand!

It's an emergency!
An emergency!

What is it? I forgot that I left
the gas main on, which leaks!

Good gosh That sounds dangerous
It's a deadly, odorless, colorless,

"liquid-less" gas that... that attacks
the central nervous system

and causes diarrhea
and facial tics!

Okay All right Well, thanks
for calling, Miles Okay Bye-bye

I think she bought it

So, tell me

who sent you?

Mr Smith

Is this Mr Smith?

No

That's his lawyer

Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double

What now? We wait for WheezyJoe
We tell him it's a no-go

Careful
Rottweilers

Looks like she's gone
Looks like she bought it

Good stuff There's no one
here Except for the rottweilers

Sure Rottweilers

You go that way

WheezyJoe?

WheezyJoe,
thank God you're in time

You're not in time We're in
time Thank God we're in time

Look, it's a no-go You get it? No one need
be the wiser, so you can just go on home

Good-bye You know,
thank you so much

<i>Hear that? Okay?
No, no No, no No, no</i>

No-go No contract
It's off It's...

Will you explain to the lunkhead
that it's a no-go? No-go It's a no-go

<i>We'll settle your contract later Look,
you're fired, pal Let it go Walk away</i>

Golden parachute
Don't let the screen door hit you Does he speak any language?

Here's what happened,
Mr Carnera We feel that...

Wait, wait, wait, wait

<i>Wheezy! Uh...</i>

Told him it was a no-go

<i>Gentlemen
Freddy</i>

Hello, Marylin
Hello, Miles

This is where we first met, remember?
Of course I remember

It's hard to believe that when you walk out that
door today, you'll be walking out of my life forever

It's not something
I wanted either

But, then, I guess

something inside of me died

when I realized that
you'd hired a goon to kill me

Wait a minute You hired him to
kill me No Both of you wait a minute

Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone
Hear, hear

Apparently, from what I can gather,
a burglar broke into your house

<i>Miles's house
Whatever!</i>

A burglar broke in intending
to loot the place, uh, repented,

became despondent over his
lifestyle and shot himself

So where does that leave you and me?
Well, we've outlined a settlement

<i>We think it's very generous My client
is prepared to consider a reconciliation</i>

But how could I trust you,
Miles, after all this?

<i>See, that's exactly right The point is...
You wounded me first, Marylin</i>

I'm not proud of what I've done,
but God knows, I did trust you once

<i>If you couldjust...
just give us another chance</i>

Well, if you'll pardon me here, but I think my
client is well beyond the point of considering...

How could I ever trust you again?
I mean, really trust you, Miles?

Marylin, there is nothing
in the Massey prenup that says

it can't be executed
after the parties wed

Well, if this, uh, indeed
is a Massey prenup,

and a cursory examination
tends to support that it is, then...

Oh, my God, Marylin
You're exposed

Marylin

Counselor! Freddy!

<i>Freddy! Come on, Freddy!
No fair!</i>

<i>Freddy!</i>

Did you hear something? Only the
patter of little lawyers' feet

Where did you find Howard?

The actor?
From a TV producer

I think you know him I gave him an idea
for a new show, so he made me a partner

I guess that means I'm a partner
I guess it does

And what exactly is it
we're partners in?

<i>Who gets what and who gets who?</i>
