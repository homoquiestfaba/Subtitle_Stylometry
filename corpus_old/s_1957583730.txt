I saw that, Sara.

Qops. Don't tell my boss
I was too busy to bake anything.

Your secret's safe with me.

Uh, but only if I
get the first one.

Done.

I need your help
with something -

Carson Ranch.

The cattle ranch in Montana.

That's the one.

They need to take
out a second loan

to cover their losses
from the drought.

Yeah, a lot of farms and ranches
really suffered out there.

They did, they did.

The problem is, this loan isn't
going to be approved

unless the Carsons can show
they can make the payments.

Right now,
they're barely breaking even.

So they need to cut their costs,
orincrease their income.

Yeah. You tell that
to Travis Carson.

He's as stubborn as they come,
wants to do things his way.

Have you done a site visit?

Actually,
that's where you come in.

I want you to go.

Aren't site visits
a VP thing?

Mm-hmm. Sara, you're one of the
best financial advisors we have

and we think you'd
make an even better VP.

This is your chance to show it.

Thank you, Peter.

I appreciate the opportunity
more than you know.

But, full disclosure,
I know nothing about ranching.

That's exactly why
I want you to go.

You can analyze this business
from a fresh perspective,

maybe find a solution
that we didn't think of.

Okay then.
Of course I'll go.

So, are you thinking
early January?

We can't wait that long.

No, this loan needs
to close by Christmas.

I need you to go tomorrow.

Well, I can book a return
flight for the 23rd.

So, ho matter what happens,
you'll be home for Christmas.

Sara, what's wrong?
This is a great opportunity.

ltis. It's just...

Chloe's on Christmas
break starts tomorrow.

Oh, bring her with you.

Look, I know that
ever since Rob passed away,

Christmas has been rough
on you and Chloe.

It just hasn't had
the same feeling to it.

Well, right,

so maybe a chance of
scenery would help.

You'll get plenty of that
in the Big Sky State.

Come on, I'm sure
Chloe will love it.

Chloe:
Do I have to come with you?

It's just for a
couple of days, Chloe.

But Montana's
like the wilderness.

What if there's no Wi-Fi?

I think you have the wrong idea
about what Montana is like.

Do you know what it's like?

No, but tomorrow,
we're both going to find out.

I

{exhaling sharply)

(horn honking)

{exhaling sharply)

Is your jacket working?

Apparently not.

Okay. Come on, sweetie.

Kay:
Welcome to Kay's Place.

Nice to meet you.

I'm Sara Bradley,
and this is my daughter Chloe.

Hi.

Oh, you two look freezing.

Come on in. Sit down, please...

Thank you.

while I get you checked in.

And I will bring you
some hot cider

and some homemade fruitcake.

Thank you.

Well?

I've never actually
had fruitcake before,

so this is officially the best
fruitcake I've ever had.

I like you.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Oh, do you have a
Wi-Fi password?

Oh, we don't have Wi-Fi.

I told you!

I'm joking.

Its "StarBigSkyChristmas,
exclamation point."

Even your Wi-Fi
is Christmassy.

I wouldn't have it
any other way.

Chloe, please don't be
on your phone the whole time.

You're gonna be working.

I don't know
what else to do.

Go down to the end of the block,
and turn right.

There's a lot of
cute holiday shopping.

It was nice of Kay to loan us
that hat and these mittens.

Yeah, except they don't
have the little thingy

on the fingertips
to use on touch screens.

You say that like
it's a bad thing.

(instrumental version
of "Jingle Bells" plays)

Oh, Mom,
let's look over here.

Sure.

Hello.
Chloe: Hi.

Welcome to
St. Nick's Knickknacks.

Wow, that's the best name
for a Christmas shop ever.

Well, it used to be called
Jeffs Christmas Hut,

but that didn't catch on.


Oh, sweetie, that's so pretty.

You could put that
on your charm bracelet.

Chloe:
Oh, that's okay.

I don't wear that anymore.

Uh, can I help you
find something else?

A candy cane, perhaps?

Or, ooh, better -
this candy cane.

Right?
Beautiful.

Locally made. No, wait.
Better... artisanal.

Which is another word
for expensive.

As freakishly large candy canes
go, it's a bargain.

You're a really good salesman.

Thank you.

Not even my booth or my job.

I'm just filling in
a friend's wife.

That's really nice of you.

It's how we do
things around here.

Well, you seem to have
a knack for it.

Nailed it.
Nailed it.

Wow, in St. Nick of time.

Ohl Yeah, there was a line in--

Too far?
Yeah.

Man: Okay.

Sara: You just went right
over that line.

Man: I think it worked.
Sara: I thought it was funny.

Mom, chocolate.

Oh, um,
I guess I'm going this way.

Have a merry Christmas.

You too.

Ooh!

{man chuckling)

I

Wow. This is not
how I pictured it.

It's beautiful.

Afternoon.

Welcome to Carson Ranch.

Thank you. I'm Sara Bradley,
from Mayer/Hall.

I'm looking for Travis Carson.

Right name, wrong generation.

You're looking for
my son Travis Jr.

And are you Ms. Bradley's
executive assistant?

No. Her daughter.

Well, I'm glad to meet you both.

Well, let's find out
where he is, huh?

Beautiful day.
Much warmer than yesterday.

This place is incredible,
Mr. Carson.

Oh, call me "Pops."

Oh, hold tight.
I'll get you some hot cocoa.

Wow.

Luckily, people in Montana like
serving warm beverages.

Okay, here you go.

Both: Thank you.
(phone chiming)

Yeah, Junior's on his way back.

Hey, our head ranch hand J.T's
daughter's about your age.

Uh, name's Lexie.

I think she's out back
helping with the horses.

Why don't I introduce you?

Okay.

Huh? Come on.

Why do you guys decorate
the inside of a barn?

Well, the horses
love Christmas, too.

They like to pretend
their reindeer.

Oh, Lexie, there you are.

This is Chloe.

Her mom's here doing some
business with us.

Hi. Do you want to help
me brush the horses?

I've actually never even
pet a horse before.

It's easy. Come on.
She's really gentle.

Go ahead.

Just touch her.

Do I justcircleitor...?

Yeah, circle.
Chloe: Okay.

Lexie: There you go, you got it.

Chloe: Like this?
Lexie: Yeah.

Hi. Oh, he's so calm.

{phone vibrating)

Oh, I have to take this.

Hi.

Hi.

So, this is where
you really work.

Yes, my career in Christmas
novelties was short but sweet.

Uh...

What are you doing here?

Oh, I'm meeting
with Travis Carson.

He's expecting me.
I'm Sara Bradley.

Oh.

Travis Carson.

Really?

Yeah.
What were you expecting?

A gigantic belt buckle
and a lasso?

Of course not.

Oh, let me help.

Oh, thank you.

So, I-l just want
to say up front

that we are on the same team.

Okay? We, uh-- ooh.

We both want you to
get that loan approved.

You know that, right?

And I just want to say
that Peter's recommendations

to cut labor are a non-starter.

Those men are my family.

Well, that's why I'm here...

to help you find a different way

to get out the numbers
you need to show the bank.

And if you can't?

1 will.

You know what?
I just came over to say hello

before we start tomorrow.

I probably should get back to
the inn and get some rest.

Of course.

Okay.


Looks good.

Lexie: There you go.
I think she likes it.

How'd it go?

Oh, it's so fun.

It's way better
working with a friend.

Thanks for inviting
me to help.

Oh, Chloe, this
is Travis Carson Jr.

Hello.

The knickknack guy.

I'm actually a rancher guy.

And, if I may...

...this is my horse Rustler.

He's as gentle
as they come.

Sorry, I'm still not
really used to horses.

That's okay.

Here's a funny thing
about Rustler -

he loves Christmas music,
he does.

(humming "Jingle Bells")
There he is.

Here, give it a try.

Oh, no, it's okay.

Come on.
â™ª Jingle bells, jingle... â™ª

â™ª Bells, jingle all the way â™ª

(whinnying)
There you go.

Good job, buddy.

You have a real way
with animals.

You wanna help with
the chicks in the back barn?

Can we go right now?

Uh, we should be getting back.

Oh, yeah, you gotta
get back before rush hour.

Rush hour?

No. Just some
cattle crossing the road.

So, did you have fun today?

I guess.

What do you mean you guess?

It was okay.

You don't want to admit

that I was right about
Montana being an adventure.

So, does that mean

you don't want to go back
to the ranch with me tomorrow?

I didn't say that.

Hey.

They don't all have to
be white lights, you know.

Well, that's the way
Mom always used to do it.

That doesn't mean
it's set in stone.

Nothing really is.

We still talking
about the lights,

or we talking about
how I run the ranch?

Something has to give, son.

I know it's not your fault
that we're in this pinch.

Everyone's trying to recover
from the drought.

But... we really need that
second loan, you know?

Yeah.

I know it's tough
being the bad guy.

Butif it's a decision between

laying people off
and losing everything--

No, we're not laying anyone off.

I'd prefer to sell
part of the land.

Okay then.

Okay.

Can't hurt to hear
Sara's ideas.

And then, you're gonna have
to make a tough choice,

just like you did
when you moved back here.

Ah, that wasn't a tough choice.

I only moved away
because I wanted to try

something completely
different from this life.


Well, corporate law is just
about as different as it gets.

Yes, itis.

But after a while, I realized
I not only left home,

I left who I was.

My only regret is not
coming home sooner,

so I could spend
more time with Mom.

Now, there's nothing you
could've done for Mom back then.

And now, you're keeping
her Christmas traditions

alive and well.

But son, this ranch
is running on fumes.

You gotta make some changes
or accept the fact

that this could be the last
Christmas we spend here.

(sighin
See?

Sometimes changing things up...

makes what you
already have better.

The lights are a metaphor.

Oh, I get it, Dad.

And, uh, I hear you.

I know you do.

(horn honking)

{car door closing)

Morning.

Morning.

Pops said it was okay
if I brought Chloe

because Lexie's here.

Yeah, that's fine.

Uh, she's around back
with the chickens.

Do they like
Christmas carols, too?

They're more into Classic Rock.

Have fun.

Look, I meant everything
that I said yesterday.

But, uh...

I suppose I need
to let you do your job.

I talked some sense into him.

I owe you one.

Well, come on, let's goin.

After you.

Your timing's perfect -

Kay just dropped off some
of her candy cane cocoa.

Kay from the B&B?

Yeah, she's an old friend.

She's always bringing by her
home cooking from the inn.

Wow.
That's really nice of her.

Oh, people in town are always
coming by here at Christmas.

Kay comes over a little
more often than most.

Have a seat.
I'll get you some cocoa.

Oh, can I get that to go?

I'd really like
to get started.

Can we go into your office
and dig into the books?

Easy there.

You don't walk through
someone's front door

and get straight to business.

You're on Montana time.

What does that mean?

That means, here,
we don't rush things,

especially at Christmas.

We take our time to sit
and chat and eat cookies

and drink candy cane cocoa.

Then, we start.
Thank you.

Oh, is that a
showman-shaped marshmallow?

Yeah, Kay makes them
special for the bonfire

and she gives me
any extras, of course.

So, do you sell the
cocoa at the bonfire?

Of course not.
They're friends.

Oh, and she dropped
by some sausage rolls.

Or have you already tried
them at the inn?

Actually, I'm a vegetarian.

Oh, well, we won't
hold that against you.

I'll go see if the girls
want some cocoa.

I'm really glad that
Chloe's found a friend.

It's not easy being
an only child,

especially when it's just
the two of us now.

Travis:
I bet.

How 'bout you? Any kids?

Always wanted to, yeah.

Christmas with my parents

was probably
the best time of my life.

But, uh...

sometimes things don't work out
the way that you planned.

Yeah, Chloe and I
know that firsthand.

The other thing I know is that
we have a lot of work to do.

Wow.
That was a terrible segue.

-Wasn'tit?
Mm-hmm.

But seriously,

I'd like to start by digging
into last year's cash flow.

Have you finished your cocoa?

No.

You know the rules.

You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

Nothing worth doing ever is.

Fine.

Ready?

I reckon I am.

Great. Let's get started.

This way.

(horse whinnying)

Is this your office?

No, this is a barn.

I just wanted to
give you a little tour

before you bury
yourself in the numbers.

The ranch is about a lot more
than just what's on paper.

This is beautiful.
How old is it?

About 150 years.

Sara: So, what do you do
with it at Christmas?

We host the annual
Christmas potluck,

and until then,
it's usually storage.

I hate to tell you this,
but you've been robbed.

Well, we haven't set it up yet.

We have eight days
until Christmas Eve,

and by then, this entire barn

is gonna be
a Christmas wonderland.

Everybody pitches in

to set up the tables,
and the centerpieces,

and even a stage for musicians.

That sounds expensive.

So, what's the overhead
on this dinner?

Zero.
Everybody pitches in.

Have you ever considered
renting this place out

for weddings or special events?

That's not what
this place is for.

Could be.

Ahh...

Wow.

Right? My mom collected these

over all the years our family
hosted the Christmas potluck.

When she passed, I promised her
that I would keep it going.

I do hope this
isn't the last one.

I've already thought of a
couple of ways to cut costs.

Well, if those ways involve our
Christmas traditions,

you can forget it.

I would never ask anyone
to give up Christmas

Isn't that what you're doing?

I'm doing my job,
and I'm gonna need your help.

And you'll get it...

...right after I do my job.

Are you going
all the way up there?

Well, unless you want to.

Maybe you could have
one of the ranch hands do it

and we could
go back to your office.

Oh, they're out getting feed,

or moving the cattle, making
sure the pipes are flowing...

What are you writing down?

This is just valuable
information

about your
day-to-day operations.

Well, outside of Christmas,
on any given day,

I'd be working
right alongside them.

Okay.

You write that down.
That's important.

That's a cowboy's worth ethic.

You wouldn't ask anyone
to do anything

you wouldn't do yourself.

Got it.

What?

Just seems like a waste
of perfectly nice garland

to put it all the way
up in the rafters.

Oh.
Well, what do you suggest?

Well, a few years ago,

we did this zig-zag with garland

to look like a Christmas tree
all the way up the wall.

We threaded in some lights

and we put a star on top.
It was really beautiful.

Okay. That sounds interesting.
You have any pictures?

Um, I don't know,
that's going back a while.

We've tried to keep
Christmas pretty low-key

since my husband passed away.

Oh. I... didn't know.

I'm sorry.
How long ago was it?

Four years.

Sometimes it seems
like a lifetime

and sometimes it seems
like just yesterday.

If this is too hard,
we can go back to the office

and do what you
need to get done.

No, I'm okay.

Let's do that tree.

Okay.

Right.

Um, actually...

So, garland...

...this would be perfect.

Yep, okay.

This is not gonna take
any time at all.

Oh my gosh.

Hey, what do you
think about this?

That's a great call.

We can do, like,
you know, on your back.

I'm excited about
just getting going, so...

I think you're low-key about it.

I'm fired up.

Okay. Good.

Whoa!
I'm fine.

I can see that.

And you will be, too.

Thank you. I mean, this ranch

means the world
to my family and me.

I can see that.

Okay. You should do honors.
Here you go.

Okay.

You were right.

It looks amazing.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

And now there's plenty of time
to go over your expenses.

Wow. Wow.

You jumped back to work mode
so fast, it gives me whiplash.

It's been a long time since
I saw snow fall.

When was the last time
it snowed in Los Angles?

Um, twenty years ago.

Snowed just enough to
make everything white...

for about an hour.

Hopefully this'll stick
around a little longer.

Let's go.


Hey.

First time seeing snow, huh?

Unless you count
the sledding hill

they made for
the winter dance at school.

I don't count that, no.

But just wait.

When the snow covers everything
in sight

and the Christmas
lights reflect off of it...

in that one, quiet moment,

the world is and
new and perfect.

I like Montana snow better.

Are these the marshmallows
Pops was talking about?

Chloe: Kay let me
and Lexie help.

And then, she taught
us how to knit.

Wow!
You have been busy!

What are you knitting?

Atiny little
Christmas scarf.

Sara: Kay, thank you
for keeping her so busy.

I think I had
more fun than they did.

Did you two get a lot done?

I'm just getting
a feel for the place.

Well, in that case,

I hope you can stay for
lunch in a couple hours.

Mom, can we stay?

Well, just as long as there's no
talking business at the table.

Well, then, we're going to have
to talk about it before lunch.

There's just enough time for me

to go through your
most recent balance sheet.

{blowing raspberry)

Oh, can I go visit
the horses while you guys work?

Go ahead.

Can I go too?

Funny.

{Chloe chuckling)

Let's go.

Ranching is actually
a lot more high-tech

than most people think.

With GPS, I can see where every
single head of cattle is

on a screen at one time.

This is not what I expected
your office to look like.

One second.

How about now?

Yes.
That's what was missing.

You know, I have
never met anyone

as into Christmas as you.

Making up for lost time.

I think when I left the ranch,
I left Christmas behind, too.

Where did you go?

Law school.

You're a lawyer?

Was, yeah. I was pretty good
at it, too.

But itwasn't
what I was looking for.

What were you looking for?

Something different.

I mean, haven't you ever
wanted a change

just to see if that's
where you were meant to be?

Not really.

The reason I'm up
for a promotion

is because I stayed the course,
I rose up through the ranks.

There's something
to be said for stability.

Yes, there is,
and I had that in New York.

But after a few years,

I just had to admit
that I wasn't happy.

I missed everything
single thing about this place,

especially at Christmas.

You missed Christmas
in New York City,

the most Christmassy
place in the world?

ltwasn't home.

Sometimes home is the hardest
place to be at Christmas.

Hmm.

Well, in that case,

I hope that someday you can
bring Christmas home again.

I'll show you our
balance sheets.

Okay, anything on
a green plate is vegetarian.

That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

Oh, thank Kay -
she put it together.

Amazing in
the kitchen, this one.

Yeah, when Kay's not around,
things aren't quite as gourmet.

I don't know
why I picture ranchers

eating beans out of a tin pot.

What? That is a clichÃ©
from a bad movie.

Son, remind me

what we had for
supper last night?

Beans.

Straight out of the pot.

(all chuckling)

While you picture
ranchers eating beans,

I picture people from LA
eating kale, like all the time.

Well, I guess we both have
certain misconceptions.

Mom, you had kale
chips on the plane.

Shh...
(all laughing)

So, Chloe, what do you think
of the ranch so far?

Um, it's pretty cool.

Trust me.
This is high praise.

You are here at
the best time of the year.

Some of the fondest
memories of my life

are from Christmas
on this ranch.

Me, too, Dad.


In fact, I get just as
excited for Christmas now

as I did when I was a kid.

When I was a kid,

I loved that moment of seeing
the Christmas tree all lit up,

Christmas Eve,
right before Santa came,

and I just wished that feeling
could last forever.

I know exactly how you feel.

What about you, Chloe?

What's your favorite
Christmas memory?

Um...

just..spending time
with family.

That's my favorite part, too.

Travis: My absolutely favorite
thing about Christmas

is actually
happening tonight,

it's the Carson Ranch
Christmas bonfire,

sort of a gigantic campout
with family and friends,

and it's just... joyful.

I hope you and
Chloe will join us.

You better save them

front row seats in
front of the fire.

It's going to be
in the low-20's tonight.

Oh, yeah, that's right.

You guys aren't
equipped for this.


So, Chloe, I don't think
we have much choice.

Either with stay indoors

while I finish my work
and we fly back to LA,

or we go into town and we
get ourselves some new coats.

I vote coats.

Well, the snow's coming down
pretty hard. If you want,

I can give you a lift into town,

Oh, you don't need to do that.

Have-- have you
ever driven in the snow?

We barely drive in the rain.

(all laughing)

I

I don't know about this coat.

Here, try this one.

Ooh.

How does anyone
move around in these?

Ah, you figure it out.

I'm never taking it off.

Excellent.

Actually, I like it.

Feels like I'm wrapped in a
thousand fuzzy blankets.

We'll take these.

So, back to the ranch?

Uh, no. We have
one more errand to run.

Merry Christmas.

Oh, merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

You can't possibly
know all these people.

Oh, I don't.
Don't know that guy.

Oh. No, wait. I do.
Merry Christmas, Stan!


All right, load up.
You know what they say -

Cold hands, cold head--

Cold heart?

No. Just put it on or
you'll be super cold.

Here you go.
Merry Christmas.

Oh. Oh, that's a hard pass.

You can't say no. It's a gift.

Then, thank you.
You're welcome.

Oh...

Oh my goodness.

Oh. Oh, you're killing me.

I think it's awesome.

Thank you very much
for this hat.

Oh, look what I found.

No way.

Turnaround is fair play.

Adorable.

It's awful.
What about me?

Thank you.
What about me?

Oh. Take this guy.

Oh, thank you.

Ooh, I actually
look cute.

Travis: You do!
That's disappointing.


Oh, that's horrifying.

Truly.
It's the worst.

Oh, I actually really
like these, though.

Oh, can I get them?

Cool. Yeah, we can get these.

I'll get you some mittens.
Thank you.

Sweet.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Slow down!

Does she always
walk so fast?

Yep. There's nothing she
hates more than a stroll.

Not when there's
so much to do.

I've been researching
regenerative soil techniques,

modernization, and there's just
a lot to think about.

You really do care, huh?

I told you I did.

Oh, we have one
more thing to get.

Boots?

Boots.

Boots.

(chattering, cheering)

Let's pass these around.

Oh, Chloe,
this is my mom and dad.

Hi, Chloe.

Hi.
It's great to meet you.

Yeah, you, too.

Let's go roast these.

Have fun.

You know, you could make
a lot of extra income

by selling this, right?

That's not what
Christmas is about.

We're not gonna take
money from my friends.

I get it.

What?

Why this is your favorite thing.

Everyone is just out
celebrating.

Nobody's rushing,
nobody's stressed.

It's like everyone pressed
â€˜pause' for the night.

You can do it, too.

I can't seem
to get out of fast forward.

Give ittime.
You'll figure it out.

I'm don't think
we'll be here long enough.

Hi. Well, it's almost time
for Christmas carols.

So, what is your favorite?

Uh... I don't know.

We already did "Jingle Bells"
with the horse.

So, maybe "Deck the Halls?"

Done.
That would've been my pick.

Travis.

Hey! Oh, hey.

Um, Sara and Chloe Bradley,

this is my
good friend Stephen.

He runs the best
restaurant in Big Fork.

Pleasure, ma'am.

Sara is the financial
advisor from California.

Oh. Well, I could've guessed
you weren't from around here.

How?

Uh...

New duds.

Travis, I can't believe
you let me walk around

with that tag inside
my jacket this whole time!

No, I didn't notice! I swear!
I promise. I promise.

Do you want to go
see the marshmallow roast?

I would love to.

Nice to meet you.

Stephen: Likewise.

Haven't seen
that look in your eye

since you moved back from NYC.

Oh, stop.

I'm just saying,
it's nice to see.


This is perfect.

It sure is.

â™ª Deck the halls with boughs of

(all laughing)


Everything okay?

I'm just frustrated.

I thought, once I got here,

a solution for the ranch
would just come to me.

It usually does.

Well, your first problem is

is there's nothing's
quick Big Fork.

And the second is
you should be at the ranch

for your inspiration, not here.

Now, go, get some sleep.

I'll drive you out
in the morning.

That's so nice.
Thank you.

Think nothing of it.

Pops: Hey!
Sara: Hil

Hello! Good morning!

Hey, Pops.

So, how are you
fixed for egg nog?

Running a little low.

Any chance you could find some
time to whip up another batch?

Kay:
Well, I can make time.

Hey, Lexie.

Hey, Chloe.
I like your boots.

Thank you. They're new.

Would you girls like to
help me with the egg nog?

Yes!
Sure!

Okay, first, though,
we need some eggs.

Uh, where you going?

Kitchen's that way.

Yeah, but the eggs
are back there.

Oh, I don't think
I could do that.

You were great with the horses.

The chickens are
even easier. Come on.

Sara: Have fun.

{Kay chuckling)

I'm just gonna have
a look around the ranch.




-Woman: Hey.
Man: How you doing?

Hi.


Wow,
this place is coming along.

Yeah. Only four days
till Christmas Eve.

Come on!

Hey!
Snowball fights outside only.

And no sneak attacks.

Sorry, Dad.
Come on, guys.

Chloe: Hey!

Sorry about that, ma'am.
Kids are on break.

Oh, J.T. Ryan -
head ranch hand.

Sara Bradley.
Nice to meet you.

I better go give
Teddy some backup.

Would you do me a favor and
help me unbox these plates?

Sure.

It's amazing to see the whole
town enjoying your ranch.

That's what
Christmas is all about.

I can see that.

These are beautiful.

Thank you.
Some of them were my mom's,

passed down from
three generations before that.

I bet she'd be proud

to know that you're
keeping up the tradition.

Yeah. You know,
that's what I missed

when I was in New York.

It's the things that make
Christmas personal

are the things that you
look forward to the most.

You know?

For me and Chloe,

Christmas just became
something to get through

instead of something
to celebrate.

Have you ever spoken to her
about how things used to be?

I've tried.
It just gets her upset.

I'm sorry.

That's none of my business.

I just know how healing
it was for me

to keep my mother's
traditions alive,

especially not being able to
get back when she was sick...

and then everything
happened so... quickly

I wasn't ready.

I don't think anybody is.

Your whole life
changes in an instant.

That's true.

And the way my parents
loved each other, I mean,

that's how I pictured Christmas
was gonna be with family.

I think you'll be
a wonderful father someday.

You connect so easily to kids.

Thank you.

And Chloe makes it easy.
She's a great kid.

She is lighter here,
more connected.

That's what's great about life
here is connecting with people,

you know,
sitting together, talking.

We take the time,

and enjoy the journey
as much as the destination.

And I'm always too busy

finding my fastest way
to the destination.

You are working
hard to provide

a great life for Chloe,
and you're doing a great job.

Yeah. There's nothing
more important to me.

She needs to know
we're going to be okay.

She's lucky to
have a mom like you.

{footsteps approaching)


Teddy turned on me.


Oh, I'll be back after the crew
and I feed the stock.

Let me know if
you need anything.

Will do.


He's nice.

Yeah,
he's like a brother to me.

His dad worked here,
too, back in the day.

Alot of our ranch hands are
second, even third generation.

I can see why Peter's
recommendations

weren't going to work.

I'm glad you understand.

I do.

(bell ringing)
(cows lowing)

Oh. Must be time to go.

Where?

Back to the house.

First rule of ranch life,
never ignore the chow bell.


Hey. We heard the bell.
What's cooking?

Presenting Chloe
and Lexie's secret--

Both: Super secret.

--Super secret recipe egg nog.

There you go.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Oh, look, I puta cinnamon
stick in, like Dad used to.

You remember that?

I remember everything.

{phone ringing)

Oh. Excuse me. Here.

Sure.

I get some, too.

Fair enough.

(all laughing)

I know, Peter.

But it's different
once you see it in person.

There are just a lot of
moving parts to consider.

Well, if you can't come up with
an alternate solution,

you need to help
him do what he has to do.

Did you send me here to try to
talk him into laying people off?

Well, of course not.
I sent you there

because we're trying to help
one of our oldest clients

hang onto his legacy.

But you only got
three more left, Sara.

At some point,

you're going to have to tell
them the same thing I did.

I still have time. Bye.

Everything okay?

It will be.

I know there's a lot
riding on all this for everyone.

Well, we appreciate
you trying to find

a different way to
make the loan happen.

Yeah, I'm doing my best.

It would be a lot easier
if I didn't care so much...

...about the ranch, and your
family, and the traditions.

I didn't expect that.

I didn't expect that either.

I've got an idea.

What?

Nothing clears
the head like a long ride,

and at Christmas time,
it's even better.

You ever been on a horse?

Does sitting on a pony

walking around in a circle
when you're five count?

No. No, it doesn't.
But don't worry.

welll find the
right horse for you.

It's always good to match

a rider's personality
with a horse.

Sara, this is Liberty.

Smartas a whip,
fiercely loyal

and has a heart of gold.

Hello.

Sara: Do I really
have to wear this thing?

Yes. Safety first.
Now, come on. I'll leg you up.

You'll what me up?

You use my hands as a stool,
I give you a boost,

then you throw your other leg
over the back of the horse.

Don't worry about it.
I'll be right here.

Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
All right?

Yeah.

No, wait. Okay.
Okay, okay.

I'm right here.
All right.

You want to try that again?

Yeah. Yeah.
I don't give up so easily.

Okay.

Okay.

Ready?

Whoo!
Perfect!

1 did it.
Great job.

Okay.
Great job! Oh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

You just-- you squeezed
your legs together a little.

To her, that means "go."
Okay.

Now, just use the reins, right?

Right, left -
it's like driving a car.

All right. Oh, yeah.
I got this.

Okay.
Sara: I got it.

You're doing great.

{clicking tongue)

(horse whinnying)

{sighing contentedly)
This is great.

You're a natural.

Oh, I didn't say go!
I didn't do the leg thing!

Don't worry. You're going
in the right direction.

I got your back.

I

That was amazing.

It was fun, right?

Yeah.

You're a natural.

Thank you.

Thanks, Luke.

Chloe: Mom!
I've been taking photos.

You know how to ride a horse?

It was more like walking a
horse, but I suppose, yes.

You want to learn how?

So, we could go riding
together someday?

I would love that.

Hey, Neil.
Hey, kids. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas,
and thanks again.

Qur pleasure.

Oh, that's the Hayes family.

They get their tree
from us every year.

Hmm. I'll see
you guys at the house.

See ya, sweetie.
Okay.

You didn't mention you were
running a Christmas tree lot.

Well, we aren't.

But I invite people to get
their trees from us every year.

And you don't charge for that.

Well, no. That'd be
like me charging you

for riding lessons.

I mean, I realize it's
not a huge income stream,

but every little bit helps.

Well, tell you what,

if you come up with us
to get our tree tonight,

I will charge you for the honor.

You're joking, but you're
actually onto something.

Am I?

So, why do you wait so long
to cut down your tree?

Well, my dad couldn't take any
time off work

until a couple days
before Christmas,

so we'd save up all the
decorating until then.

and I guess it just
became a tradition.

Seems like everything around
here becomes a tradition.

Well, when you find
something special,

you try to keep it around.

(Sara exhaling deeply)

Oh, it's beautiful out here.

I mean, it's like a
show globe come to life.

It's like what everyone thinks
Christmas should look like.

Merry Christmas!

How can you do this every year
without losing all your trees?

Well, we plant two for every
one that someone takes.

I mean, that's what ranching is,
its cyclical,

everything has
atime and a place,

and everything we do now
matters for the future.

Come on, come on.
Less talking, more looking

Okay.


How â€˜bout that one?

Ehh. It's a good
Charlie Brown Christmas tree.

Or how â€˜bout that one?

welll find
one for you.

This is the one.

That's a great one.
You've got a good eye.

Here you go.

You want me to do it?

It's all a part of the Christmas
in Montana experience, yeah.

I suppose it is.

Okay.

Come on, Mom, let's doit.

Okay. Just watch out, sweetie.

I'll get that bottom
branches first.

All right.

Okay.

Okay, let â€˜er go.

Three, two, one!

Timber! Whoo!


All right,
let's get â€˜er home.

All right.

Travis: Nice cut.

You just did that.
I know!

I didn't see that.
Oh, should we help you?

Sure.
Okay.

Come on.

Grab an end.
Let's go.

This is heavier
than I thought.

Chloe: Oh, yeah, it totally is.

You're doing great.

Oh my gosh.
That's really heavy.

Kay: You know, why don't
you put that one right there?

I think that'll look nice.

Every member of the family,
going back for generations,

has an ornament
with their name on it,

and they all go on the tree.

Including friends
who become family.


I have the perfect place for it.

Kay: Thank you.

It's a beautiful tradition.

And now, you're a part
of it, too.

Thank you.

Around here,
when people help each other,

they become family.

We know you're doing
everything you can to help us.

Well, you've helped us, too,

more than you know.

I wish dad could see this.

He can.

Wow,
it's so pretty.

Oh...

Here you go.

Thank you.


It's freezing out here.
Don't you want to go inside?

I actually like the cold -
it helps me think.

Who knew?

I did, of course.

This place is incredible.

I've never seen Christmas
brought to life like this.

I'd like to think

it's all about who you
experience it with.

Well, I'm glad it's with you.

And your family, of course.

Of course.

Did you pay someone to do that?

It's the Ursids meteor shower.

It's peaking tonight.

I thought it was gonna be
cloudy,

but it's clear as can be.

It's amazing.

Do you think Chloe'd
like to see this?

I'll go get her.

I have never seen
a meteor shower before.

All the city lights
get in the way?

That, and
I was never patient enough.

Oh, there's a big one
right there. Make a wish.

I

I

Pops: Hey, thanks for
doing the dishes, guys.

It's literally the least I could
do after such a wonderful day.

Ava.

Look at her.

After Kay left,
she put her head down

and fell asleep
in, like, ten seconds.

I love how tired she is at the
end of a day on the ranch,

and she's never seemed happier.

It's funny, that's what she said
the same thing about you.

Hey, Chlo',
you ready to go back to the inn?

No.

I think she's down
for the count.

Yeah. So, just stay.

You can take
the extra couch.

We got plenty of blankets.

And in the morning,
we can have a big breakfast.

And then...
Both: We can get to work.

Oh, beat you to it that time.

I

Do you have
everything you need?

I think so.

Okay, well, just in case.

It gets cold.

Thank you.

Sure.

Night.

Good night.

I

I was hoping you were
gonna be here this morning.

Well, you can't have breakfast

without my famous cinnamon
rolls, now, can you?

No, we cannot!


Okay, let's dig in.

Hey!

What? They're delicious.

Well, don'ttell anyone,
they're from a can.

What?

No way.

Okay, they're homemade.

(all laughing)

Kay: I just didn't want
your dad to overdo it.

Hey, I'll skip lunch.

(all laughing)

So, did you sleep okay?

Better than
I have in a long time.

You know, as long as
a Carson owns this ranch,

you have an invitation
for breakfast anytime.

I better get back
to the B&B soon,

so I can make sure a Carson does
own this ranch,

now and in the future.

But can we at least stop

at the Christmas market
on the way back?

Yeah, sure.

I

Chloe: Thanks for
taking me, Mom.

I wanted to pick up some more
yarn for my scarf.

Alot of yarn.

I really like this color,

but it's cashmere,
so it's really expensive.

I got you.
Actually?

Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

Here you go.

That scarf is going
to be beautiful.

Thank you. Do you want me to
teach you how to make one?

I mean,
I know you have to work, so...

Um, Iwill...

after you teach me to knit.

Okay.

Um, so, this is the eighth
row on my Christmas scarf,

and basically,
all you have to do

is take that...

and then do that.

Here, you try it.

Okay.

Well, do you want
me to help you?

Yes, please.

Okay. So, put the
needle through the loop.

Mm-hmm.

Grab the yarn.
Yep.

Pull it through.

Yep.
Under stitch.

Slide it off.

Yeah! You just did
one stitch.

I'm exhausted.


Mom?

This is the best Christmas
we've had since Dad died.

I think so, too.

And do we really have
to leave on the 23rd?

I mean, that's the deadline.
After that, my work is done.

Well, can't we just
stay for Christmas?


Sweetie, we can't
invite ourselves

to someone else's Christmas,

no matter how much
we want to be there.

And if my recommendation
isthe same as Peter's,

I doubt I'll be welcome anyway.

Right.

Okay, show me one more time.

Okay.
So, through?

Yep. Yep.

Oh, there itis.
Mm-hmm, and then let go.

Let go?
Yep. Just pull it like that.

Oh, slide it.
Yep.

Ah. You said "let go."
Okay, well, slide it.

If I let go,
I just drop it.

I

Midnight snack?

Kay's fruitcake.

I can't get enough
of this stuff.

Well, no one can say that
you haven't embraced

the Christmas spirit here.

You have, too.

You know,
as a matter of fact, I have.

Oh...

Mm-hmm.

Where did you get those?

In the markets.

I figured, when in Montana...

I love them.
Thank you, Mom.

{phone ringing)

Hi, Peter.

Apologies for the late call.

I'm, uh--
I'm just concerned.

Don't worry. You'll have the
report first thing tomorrow.

Actually, I'm more concerned
about your methodology.

What do you mean?

Well, you know that my
granddaughter

follows your daughter
on social media, right?

Katie? Sure.

Yeah, they're been friendly
since the company picnic.

I still am not following.

Well, Katie and I
went out to dinner tonight

and she showed me Chloe's feed.

Now, don't get me wrong,
I'm glad you're having fun.

But I don't know what to think
when I see pictures of you

decorating a Christmas tree,

on a horse, singing
Christmas carols by a bonfire.

I was just doing what
you're always talking about -

putting people before profits.

Yes, that is what we try to do.

But in the end, the Carsons are
still gonna have to prove

they can afford this loan.

I'm looking at those pictures,
and I'm wondering

whether they're running
a cattle business

Peter, what is the last possible
minute I can send in my report?

They'll need time to
review it upstairs, Sara.

Noon tomorrow,
that's the best I can do.

That's all I need.

What happened?

You know how much it bugs me

when you post pictures of
absolutely everything we do.

Mm-hmm.

Your doing that might have
just saved this ranch.

What? How?

I'll explain later.

But right now,
you need to get some sleep

and I need to get to work.

Okay.

I

I think you singlehandedly drank

all the coffee
I had in the entire inn.

I'm sorry.
I just have to keep going.

Il think I found
the solution for the ranch.

That's wonderful news!

Well, I still have
to convince Travis

and the bank
to agree to my proposal.

May I see?

I can't believe nobody's
thought of doing this before.

Sometimes it takes an outsider

to see things
from a different angle.

You're no outsider now.

In fact, I'd say that you're
closer to Travis Carson

than anyone since he brought
that fiancÃ©e back from New York.

He was engaged?

Only until the
young lady realized

she wasn't marrying a lawyer,
she was marrying a rancher.

He hasn't been
with anyone since.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

I would have thought he was

Big Fork's
most eligible bachelor.

Everyone here knew
his heart was closed.

Until now.

I better go wake
Chloe up and get over there.

I can't wait to show
this to Travis.

{cows lowing)

Well, I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this.

Well, unless Sara has some
other recommendations,

this is the only answer.

Are you sure?

No, and I hate to
part of our land,

but it's better than
losing the people we love.

Both: I need to talk to you.

I'll leave you two. Sara.

Please, let me go first.

I'm gonna sell
two thousand acres.

What? But that's ten percent
of your property.

I know, but this way,
we won't need the loan at all.

Maybe not this year,
but what about the future?

What if there's another drought?

This is what
we have to do now.

But if you listen to what I have
to say, you might never have to.

Okay.
What are you talking about?

It finally hit me.

This was never going to work
if we focus on cutting costs.

It's about adding profitability
year in and year out

by monetizing everything you're
already doing for Christmas.

Oh, we already
talked about this.

That is not what
this ranch is about.

I'm not gonna charge
my family and friends.

No, you don't need to.

This is about the people
who would travel here

to find that classic,

old-fashioned,
Christmas they're longing for.

Just-just look at
the proposal, okay?

Okay.
Just let me show it to you.

All right.

("We Wish You a
Merry Christmas" playing)

I

What do you think?

And you're sure
there's a market for this?

I was up all night
doing the research.

There are already a couple of
ranches upstate doing this.

And look at what they
charge per week.

Wow!

Now you see why I got
so excited about the idea.

But who'd run it, though?

I mean, Pops and I
still have to run the ranch.

Well, you'd have to
hire a manager

and that is all
laid out in this budget.

I also worked out
a loan structure

so that you could get the
initial funding to renovate.

Travis,
"Christmas at Carson Ranch"

is about giving people
something they're missing -

a connection to Christmas,

to family, to themselves.

I know that's what it
did for me and Chloe

and we will always be grateful.

I'm so glad we came here.

I am, too.

So, what do you think?

Do you want to move forward?

Definitely.

I

Everybody ready?

Uh, for what?

We still have to
decorate the gingerbread houses

for the dessert table,
of course.

Yeah, I'm not sure
if it's the right time.

It's the perfect time.

I mean, we all
need to do something

while we're waiting, right?

Can Lexie come, too?

Of course.
The more the merrier.

It'll help the time go faster.

Okay.

Hey, let's get started.

Sara:
So, what do you think?

Well, its gonna
be fantastic.

I just hope it
isn't the only version

of the Christmas
ranch we get to see.

I'm sure it's fine.

It's the 23rd.

I mean, that's the
day of our deadline.

Shouldn't we have heard
something by now?

Well, the underwriters have
until end of business today.

I suppose, technically, they
have as long as they want.

Wait, they can
extend the deadline?

I guess if they
can't decide by today, yes.

So, we can stay for Christmas?

I mean, we can't leave

until we know for sure
about the loan, right?

Chloe, they have
their own traditions.

We don't want to impose.

Pops: You think you'd impose?

Part of our tradition

is having people we care
about here with us -

family and friends
old and new, and that's you.

It really wouldn't
be the same without you.

In that case there's
no place we'd rather be.

I guess we'll
postpone our flights.

Great.

I


{phone ringing)

Hello?

Hi. Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Thank you.
I'll tell them.


The Carson Christmas Ranch...

is officially in business!

Yes!

We got the loan?

You got the loan!
We got the loan! Oh!

You did it!

No, we did it!

We should celebrate.

What did you have in mind?

Well, actually,
Stephen is having a little,

you know, party at his
restaurant,

kind of a
Christmas Eve-Eve tradition.

Maybe-- maybe we should go.

Uh, Chloe's welcome
too, of course. You all are.

What do you think, Chloe?

Mom, Lexie invited me

to go Christmas caroling with
her friends from school.

Her parents are chaperoning us.

That sounds like fun.

So, it's okay if I go?

Of course you can.

Kay and I could drop Chloe off
and then Kay would be at the B&B

to watch her when
she came back. Okay?

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Then, that leaves
us the two of us.

I guess so.

Well, I'm so thrilled
for you, Travis.

Yeah?
About the Christmas Ranch?

Yes, but that's not
what I was talking about.

By the way, um...

I'm really glad you've
been coming around more often.

Oh. Because of all
the food that I bring?

Yes... but that's not what
I'm talking about.

Oh...

I

You look beautiful.

You look great, too.

Thank you.

But I thought you'd
be wearing a bolo tie.

A bolo? No. I only wear those
on days that end in "never."

Big Fork really knows
how to celebrate Christmas.

That's how we do
things around here -

go big or go home.

I don't know how anyone
leaves this place.

Oh, they do.

But if they have any
Montana is in their soul,

they always
find their way back.

Like you did from New York?

Yeah. Yeah, I didn't realize how
good I had it until I left.

Sometimes you don't where you
belong until you get there

and then it all
becomes so clear.

Exactly.

Real glad to see you two.

Now, order whatever you like.

It's on the house.

Thank you.


(clearing throat)

Oh.

It helps to be
good friends with the chef.

Roasted tofu with quinoa,
peaches and fennel. Wow.

Is that a good wow or, like...
{unenthusiastically) "Wow."

That's a great "wow."
Thank you for doing that for me.

Well, you jumped into the
Montana life with both feet.

I figured the least I could do

is try a little bit
of California.

What?

If you had asked me a month ago

where I would be
on Christmas Eve-Eve,

my answer definitely would not
have been

"having a candlelight
vegetarian dinner

"with a cattle rancher
from Big Fork, Montana."

Really? 'Cause that's what my
answer would have been.

{both laughing)

Ahh.
That was really good.

Yeah, I thought
I was going to have to sneak

a second supper on my the home.

{piano playing lightly)

Would you like to dance?

I would love to.

Okay.

{piano playing lightly)

I

Did you want to
go for a stroll?

I'd love to.

Okay. You know that "stroll"
means "walking slowly," right?

I'll do my best.

Okay.

I think this is the first time

we've ever walked
at the same pace.

Yeah. Congratulations.

I think you're
finally on Montana Time.

Have I thanked you already
for saving our ranch?

Yes,
numerous times.

Good.

Have I thanked you for
reminding me

what it feels like...

to fall head over heels
for someone?

No.


I feel the same way.

But?

Maybe that's
why we shouldn't stay.

Why not?

I mean, we have to leave
right after Christmas.

And...
and then what happens?

How does this work?

I don't know.

I don't,
but we'll figure it out.

No, Travis.

This is your life.
This is your home.

I have a daughter at
school in Los Angles.

I have a job. I have security.
I cannot give that up.

I'm sorry.

I understand.

I better get back to Chloe.

I don't want to leave.

We should be going to
Christmas Eve dinner tonight,

not the airport.

Chloe, I know you're upset,
but if we stayed,

it would just make
things harder.

It's already hard.

Everything was
better here, Mom.

We were better.

You know it,
and I know it.

This is how
Christmas used to be.

You never talk
about Dad at Christmas.

We barely talk about anything,

not until we got here.

I know,
and that's my fault.

I guess I thought
I was protecting you.

I was just trying to
keep you from any more pain.

I was doing the same thing.

That's the best thing
aboutthis place, wasn't it?

People slow down,
they talk, they share.

Like right now.

Just like right now.

I still miss Dad.

I know.

Sodol.

I have something for you.

I was going to wait
until Christmas,

but I want you to have it now.

It's for the
Christmas charm bracelet

Daddy gave you when
you were little.

I know that you don't have it
with you, but I thought...

I thought maybe that you'd
want to wear it again someday.

I have it.

I always have it.

I just...

didn't want
to wear it again...

not until right now.

Thank you so much, Mom.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, sweetie.
I love you.

I love you, too.

I

{cow lowing)

I know what
you're gonna say.

And what's that?

That I shouldn't
have let her go,

that I was just too
scared to ask her to stay,

that I was worried
that it was turn out

the same way it
did with Elizabeth,

that I made
the biggest mistake of my life.

Yep. Pretty much.

Thanks for
saving me the trouble.

She has a career, Dad.

She has a life in California.
How's that gonna work?

You make her
know it in her heart

that it's at least worth trying.

And then you find a way,

even if it means moving
heaven and earth to do it.

Well, it's too late now.

Maybe not.

Kay just told me
they're still at the B&B.

For how long?

At least another
fifteen minutes.

What if she
doesn't want to stay?

What if she does?

Can you handle
things here if I go?

Of course I can,

and I'll have Kay to help me.

Dad, about Kay--

I know what you're going to say.

All I'm gonna say

is that if I'm
putting it out there,

you should, too.

Deal.

Chloe, honey, let's go upstairs,

make sure you
didn't forget anything.

Oh, but just for a minute.
The cab's almost here

Okay.

Hi.

Hi.

Is there something wrong with
the paperwork for the loan?

No.

No, nothing's
wrong the paperwork.

Okay.
{exhaling sharply)

But there's everything
wrong with you leaving.

Travis, we talked about this.

The longer we stay,
the harder it'll be to leave,

and I know if I spend
just one Christmas with you,

I will never want
to leave again.

Then stay...

for this Christmas
and every Christmas after that.

There's too much to lose.
I have to protect Chloe.

Well, you said she's
never been happier

and that you and she
have never been closer.

It's true.

So?

Isn't that what she needs?

Isn't that what
everyone needs?

Anyway, uh...

you can't leave.

Around here,
we finish what we started.

What do you mean?

Obviously,
I'm gonna need your help

to find someone
to run the Christmas Ranch.

That could take some time.

I have a candidate in mind.

In fact, I can't imagine
anyone running it but her.

I just have to convince her
to take a leap of faith.

You just did.

I really don't want to leave.

I really can't imagine
doing this without you.

{footsteps approaching)

What's going on?

We were wondering if...

you'd like to stay
through Christmas.


Is that a yes?

I think that's
a yes from both of us.

I

I'm going to go tell Lexie!

Woman: You made it!

Hi!

I'm staying for Christmas!

{chattering indistinctly)

I can't stop thinking
about how close we came

to missing all this.

Oh, you don't have to.
You're here now.

You're home.

Does it get any more
perfect than this?

Actually... yes.

I

Merry Christmas, Dad.

Merry Christmas, son.

You made it.

Merry Christmas, Sara.

Merry Christmas.

Come on.

I
