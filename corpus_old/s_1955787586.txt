Fuck!

Okay.

What the fuck?

What the... what the fuck?

What the fuck?

What the fuck?!

In the next hour,

two candidates are in a tight race
heading into the Iowa Caucus.

An update on the Colorado
missing persons case

we've been covering all week.

Five people were found dead today

in a warehouse outside Wheat Ridge,
a Denver suburb.

In a public statement,
investigators stated

they were all killed
in "a ritualistic manner".

And finally, controversial celebrity
news magazine Pop Now

has filed for bankrupt.

In other news,

the weather this weekend looks terrible.

What'd you get me?

What did I get you? /
Yeah, what'd you get me?

You'll see. / Is it lacy and frilly?

I'm intrigued.

Do you know how you always
leave your stuff in my bathroom?

Yeah, you hate it.

Do you know why I hate it?

Because it's girls' stuff
and it's not a girl's bathroom.

But it could be.

We should talk about it.

We should talk about it...

After this long, completely
avoiding the subject.

Sure.

Seriously?

Seriously.

Deal?

Deal. / Hey?

Yeah? / Shake.

All right. / Deal.

Pleasure doing business with you.

Nice doing business with you.

Thank you.

Big brother! / Hi.

Hi! You look great.

He really cleans up, doesn't he? / Yeah!

Finally! / Birthday boy! Hey!

Happy birthday! Oh.

Yeah! Hey, there he is.
/ Sorry, everyone.

My fault.

My keen instinct told me
you would all be here,

so naturally I had to change

to dress down to your level.

Ha ha. / So selfless,
even on your birthday.

You're welcome. / Yeah.

Well, we've been
celebrating without you.

Mm. / Mm. Hey, bud, one more bottle.

My wife ordered
for you already. Halibut.

Prime filet. Rare.

Hmm.

Crab. / Yes.

Burger with side of Brussels. / Mm-hmm.

Chicken piccata.

Salmon, no mushrooms.

And Hadlee.

Says she's filled up on bread,

but ends up picking
at everyone else's food.

I thought we'd all like to share.

Are we really that predictable?

Not predictable...

Committed. / Mm.

Insane people are committed,

or sell art at my gallery.

We are steadfast.

Or stubborn.

How does it feel to be old?

I asked him the same thing.

How old am I again? / You're old.

So old.

Old enough to know what you want.

What do you want for your birthday?

A toast. / Yes, a toast.

To my... / No, not your toast.

It's not your toast.

It's okay. / I'm still drinking.

I thought it was just a silly clichÃ©,

but you are living proof

that things really
do get better with age.

Okay, okay.

Okay. Babe?

I'm so thankful to celebrate
your birthday with you,

and I'm looking forward
to many, many more.

Hey, sweet.

Cheers. / Cheers.

Cheers.

Mm.

Oh! / What's this?

I thought no presents
'til tomorrow's brunch.

Yeah.

I guess we're not all
predictable after all.

You guys got him presents?

Yeah, it's his birthday.

What?

Escape room? / Yep.

Yeah. / What is that?

You're locked in a room

until you solve a series
of puzzles to get out.

And you've only got one hour.

No, that sounds horrible.

That sounds really fun.

I've heard it's the latest craze.

Remember that, um, secret mask thing,

the Macbeth thing in New York last year?

That wasn't an escape room. / I know.

I'm just saying it's the latest
underground thing.

They're popping up everywhere.

I think Shakespeare in any
form is so fucking boring.

Yeah. / I agree with you.

This won't be.
I promise.

What happens if we
don't figure it out in time?

We're trapped.

Forever.

It's a challenge.
A test of intelligence.

Hmm.

All right, I'm in.
Where is this room?

The mystery is part of the game.

Ooo, exciting!
So how do we get there?

I've arranged everything.

I just need you to play along.

How did you / Oh!

come up with something so adventurous?

Excuse me!
What, are you surprised?

Very surprised.

Good. Happy birthday.

Let's get drunk.

Really, it's not necessary.
/ No, I'm just kidding.

This is us.

Oh! / Oooh!

This is how to party. / Yes.

Damn. / I want to come.

Babe, we were so specific
about reservations.

If we could ever get ahold of you...

Ugh, I'm so unlucky.

No, honey, you're just a wild card.

Goodbye. / Come on, beautiful.

It won't be the same without you, kid.

At least I already have plans.

Do you want me to call you a cab?

I'll get a ride.
You guys have fun.

How you gonna get home?
/ Oh, I'm not going home.

This girl's got a sexy party to go to.

Sexy party.

Ay, ay!

Trouble. / Yeah.

Oh, my God, that's good.

Look at the...
Oh, look who decided to come in!

Hey, buddy, there you are!

What's up? / Happy birthday, man!

Happy birthday!

I love this stuff. / I know.

This is amazing.
Thank you.

Oh, don't thank me yet.

Oh, come on. / Okay, guys.

Gonna need your cell phones, please.

Um...

Hell no.

Yes.

Can't have you looking up
how to solve a puzzle.

No help from anyone.

Uh...

There's no lifelines in this game?

Come on! / No.

For an hour?

Come on, what's the big deal?

As birthday ambassador,

I order all of you
to relinquish your phones.

Thank you.

Hey, you know what?
Fuck it.

Hand 'em over. / Here you go.

Thank you. / Here.

As you wish, birthday ambassador.

All righty. One more.

What? / It's everyone or no one.

Fine.

Proud of you, Anderson.

Fuck off.

Ouch. / Why is he so mean to me?

I love him and he's so mean to me.

All right, guys, I'm also
going to need your wallets,

your purses, anything else
in your pockets.

Fuck.

All you can take with you are your wits.

And there's insurance
on this game and all, right?

I take full responsibility
for everything. / Okay.

Thank you, Conrad. / You're welcome.

All righty. Got it? / Nice.

Happy birthday.

Yeah!

Whoo!

Does anybody know how long
we've been driving for?

How could we,
when we can't see anything?

Let's just ask the driver.

Maybe it's not supposed to open.

It's all part of it.

Christen, how'd you find this place?

They're everywhere.
Hiding in plain sight.

What, is there an escape room app?

You just tap and sign up? What?

The Uber of entrapment games?

No, no app. No nothing on the Internet.

Well, then how'd you find it?

I got this.

What is that?

An invitation.

It's cute.

Yeah, but the question is, who sent it?

I don't know.

But I know with all the research
I've been doing on escape rooms,

my name got on some list,

and this ended up in my mailbox.

It's Morse code.

It spells G-A-M-E.

Game.

Oh!

What? / Oh.

Huh.

All right, that is cool.

Yeah, that's awesome.

Legit.

Oh.

Oh, what the fuck was that?

We're here.

You've got to be kidding me.

It's all part of the game.

Kinky.

Well, I'm too buzzed to care
at this point anyway, so...

I'm so nervous. / I got this, babe.

Ugh.

I'm so ready.

All right. Let's do this.

There's a team player. / Whoo-hoo!

Ow! Ha ha! / Lock hands, everyone.

I don't want to lose you
when I lead you out.

Whoo!

Yeah! This is awesome.

Whoo-hoo!

You're not wearing one?

Somebody's got to be in charge.

Isn't that cheating?

I don't cheat.

But it's all part of the game.

This is crazy.

Where's your hand, Tabby?

Both your hands are on my ass.

That's exactly right.

Jesus! / Okay, is everyone ready?

Yeah, let's do it.

Wait, Tyler, where's your hand?

I'm... I'm right here.

Jesus! / Well, that sounds safe.

It's fine, you guys.
Don't touch your blindfolds.

She swat me like a dog? /
Yes, I did. You know what?

If you behaved, I wouldn't have to.

I'm so turned on right now.

Okay, shh, everyone!

You have one hour.

All right.

Ow!

Christen?

What the fuck is this?

All right. All right.

All right.

Well, um...

...three. / Are you done yet?

What are you talking about?
/ I'm talking to Christen.

She's tying something to my hands.

Yeah, she tied something
to my wrists, too.

I'm taking this thing off.

You're not playing the game right.

â™ª And down beside the sea â™ª

Oh. Whoa. / What?

â™ª But when he strolled
along the promenade... â™ª

Oh, my God. / What?

Just take off your blindfold.

â™ª ...his wife, just newly wed â™ª

â™ª He got an awful scare â™ª

â™ª When someone strolling there â™ª

â™ª Came up to him and winked and said â™ª

Whoa.

â™ª Hello! Hello! â™ª

Hey, we're tied together.
/ Yeah, no shit.

â™ª Who's the little girlie
by your side? â™ª

â™ª I've seen you â™ª

Are you kidding me? /
At least I'm trying something.

Okay. / Give me a break.

All right. If I...

If I just...
All right.

That's... You're just tying it up more.

Okay. / No, that's...

All right, just... / Just...

If I just...
Fuck, Anderson!

Just... Ow! / Fuck.

I'm trying to get us out!

If I...

Hold on, if I... / If you...

If I come down like this...

No, no. / No, that's...

Conrad?

Wha... anybody?

Boo!

Oh, my God, you scared me!

Oh, mission accomplished.

Mm. You're so bad.

Aw, you like it.

Yeah, I do.

Whoa.

Okay, this is weird.

This is sick.

This is weird.

What is this?

Um, I don't know,

but can we do something
about this first?

Okay.

Oh, my God.
What is this?

I don't know. I thought
it was you grabbing me

and I kind of liked it.

I was blindfolded, Conrad.

How would I have put this on you?

God, I can't believe Christen did this.

Really?

All right. Um...

Okay, how 'bout...

how about if I do...
No.

Okay, let's... / Just stop, Anderson.

I'm trying to figure this out.

Yeah, well, it's obviously not working.

It's a fucking puzzle.
There must be another solution.

Like what?

We have to work together, okay?

Fine.

All right.

Okay, what did we do
before that hasn't worked?

Like, we need to rethink this thing.

Well, we can't untie it.
We can't go around each other.

How about if we go through it?

Through it?

Yeah, like this.
Like through it. Like through.

Like this.
Like through.

What? No, that's not right. / Yeah.

Oh, no, no, no. You were
definitely on to something here.

Okay, you put your hand here.

What's the number?

Tabby, it's part of the game.
You gotta figure it out.

So there's a reason they put

this horrible thing on you?

Yeah, it's a clue.

All right, so we have
to figure out a number

that relates to the worst
pair of underwear ever.

Yes, we do.

â™ª Bill Spry â™ª

Come on...
Do... this.

No, I... / Wait.

No, no, stop, stop, stop.

I think I got it.

â™ª Poor Bill, feelin' so ill â™ª / If I...

â™ª Yell'd out to Pilot Brown â™ª / this...

â™ª "Steady a bit, yer fool!
We're turning upside down!" â™ª

â™ª Take me back to dear... â™ª

Nice!

All right, let's find a key
to unlock this shit.

Yeah. Let's do that.

So there are four numbers.

Let's assume A is one, B is two,
and A-B-C.

You can't go higher than nine.
/ This is complicated.

All right, babe, let's brainstorm.

Why would I be wearing this belt?

Mm... sex is definitely
out of the question.

I think you nailed it.

I'm definitely not nailing you.

No, babe, what's a four letter word

that has to do with sex?

"Fuck?"

Uh-uh.

That's too many digits.

"Kink?"

Oh, wait!
What about head?

Okay, maybe we can talk about
that after we're done with this.

No, babe, that's the answer.

Oh.

Okay, so H.
So... H, so eight.

So E... / Babe.

Yeah? / Five.

All right.

A is one. Okay.

And D... Fuck. / Four.

Ah! / Yeah!

Oh!

We did it. / Yeah, we did.
Now, I'm gonna do it.

Oh, I like it.

Ah! / Anderson.

Fuck! Tyler?

You all right?

Yeah, the fucking thing cut me
in the finger when it opened.

Is Natasha with you? / I'm right here.

Is Christen with you? / No, I'm alone.

Oh, that sucks.

Is there a knob on your side?

Um... no.

Just a latch to this compartment.

Guessing you're knobless as well?

Just a combination dial.

What's the story in that room?

I don't know.

Thought it was decorated
by a bipolar novelist.

Oh. / Where are you?

My room is filled
with antique televisions

and out of sync clocks,
too many to count.

Ah. Aside from some Davy Crockett shit,

we have clocks in here, too. / Huh.

Uh, they don't seem
to be working, though.

How many are there?

Four.

And all of them are stopped?
/ Looks like it.

They're all stopped on an hour.

Okay, are they all stopped
on different hours?

Yes.

Okay. Tell me the times on the clocks.

Uh, 12 and six,

five, and eight.

Damn it.

Okay, where are the clocks?

I don't know.
All over the room.

What?

There are two on the
left hand side of the door

and two on the other.

All right, of the clocks on the left,

what is the time on the one
furthest from the door?

Uh, 12.

And the first clock
on the right hand side?

Uh, five.

Second one on the left?

Six.

And the last one on the right.

And eight.

Shit.

You did it.

No problem.

Wow, fashionable. / Yeah.

We'll see.

Guys.

All right.

It works.

Hey, there's a card here.

Wonder what it's doing there.

Is it a piece to a puzzle?
/ I don't know.

Yeah...

Is this... Is this how you took it out?

Now what?

Yikes.

Exactly.

Well, the only way out is the exit door,

which I assume will open when we win.

If we win.

Anderson. Come on.

We just killed that first puzzle
without breaking a sweat.

Don't you want to win?

We're going to get out of here in
record time. Just get on board.

All right. Lead the way, birthday boy.

But how do you suspect we're gonna
find the others if there are no doors?

It's all gotta be part of the game.

What are you looking for?
/ I don't know.

That narrows it down.

Oh, come on, Anderson.

There has to be something
that leads to the next thing.

You know, like a clue?

Oh, really?

So do you mind enlightening me, then?

All right.

Okay, well, how about these?

They're a series of
animal paintings in a line.

So what?

So it could be a clue!
I don't know.

Yes!

I bet it's based on weight.
Take those off.

Oh, yeah.

It's the food chain.

Brilliant.
Trade me.

Rabbit.

Fox. / Coyote.

Whoa. What?

Seriously?

Slackers.

Typical.

Hi. Oh, yeah?

You guys busy? / Hmm?

We can't hear you.

We can't hear you.

We... we can't hear you.

Oh, my God.

It's like he doesn't know
it's my sister.

Hey, where do you think
that door leads to?

Well, it looks like it's connected
to the other room.

But there is no door in the other room.

I know that,

but you're telling me that
doesn't look like it's connected?

Oh, it's definitely connected.

What're you doing?

Oh! / Whoa!

Wow. Fuck.

Ah.

Oh, so there was a door.

Here.

Thank you. / You're welcome.

All right, let's
get rid of these clocks.

Okay, so where's the key?

How about the ones
that unlocked the ropes?

Ah. Yeah.

Stop it.

What? Come on.

There's no way this is gonna fit.

Nice.

It was your fucking idea.

Look, there's gotta be
a key here somewhere,

let's just find it.

Oh, my God.

Would you just... / God.

Hey, hey, look for a clock
that only has a minute hand.

Why? / Just fucking do it, Anderson.

Okay.
Here, got it.

This clock only has a minute hand.

Okay. / What the hell
is up with these clocks?

Here, here, here.

All right, what the fuck?

If I...

Hm.

That's impressive. / Very impressive.

Here, help me.

Ah? / Yes!

Yeah! Hey, guys.

You're my hero. Thank you. / Hey.

You guys rescued us.

Yeah, any longer and someone's
pants'd be on the floor.

She's wearing a skirt.
/ That is correct.

Oh, gross.

What the fuck?

Uh...

Is that Christen?

Oh, my God!

Where is she?

Yeah, things just got weird.

Wow.

What?

It's all part of the game.

This is fucking cool.

Look, look. We have
41 minutes to rescue Christen.

That's the game.

Christen said we had an hour.

Well, the timer must have started
when we got here.

It was probably me.
I flipped the switch over there.

Oh.

Why isn't she in here with us?

Why would she lock herself
in a cage somewhere?

I don't know, Anderson.
That's what we have to figure out.

Fine.
Whatever.

At least we know what we're
playing for now, right?

Bingo. That's the can-do attitude

we like to hear from you, Anderson.

Now, time is of the essence.

So, it's a good thing I know
exactly what we have to do next.

Check it out.

What happened?

What do you mean?

Weren't there squares with
letters on them right here?

Oh, yeah, there were.

Yeah, but they were
there the whole time.

Are you sure about that?

'Cause you guys were just
sucking a whole bunch of face.

Yeah, well, when was the last
time you two sucked face? Huh?

Look, as soon as we got out of the room,

it must have disappeared.

It's probably the door. Huh?

Hey.

Wait!
Shut it again.

Oh, wow, I bet you
have to spell something.

Yeah, but what?

There's got to be something.

Oh, that...
What the fuck is that?

Nice.

Was that thing strapped to your junk?

It sure was.

She released the Kraken. / Oh!

Well, I'm not getting it.

Getting what? / It's another card.

Oh. / Mm-hmm.

Fuck it.

Ugh.

Guys, come on.
It was on the outside of my pants.

He's clean.
I would know.

Excellent.

Well, I don't see any other clues here,

so let's keep focused.

Go. Go, go, go. / Yeah.

Well, it obviously wants
us to spell something,

so... / How big a word?

Nine letters? / Nine letters?
Fuck, big word.

It's like an answer
to a crossword puzzle.

Oh, you love crossword puzzles.

He does.

And the answer is
in one of these newspapers.

Yes.

We don't have time
to go through all of these.

All right, some of us
look for crosswords

while the others look for clues.

You know, get a system going.

That's gonna take forever.

There has to be some kind of order.

Oh, what if there's
a clue in a headline?

Well, theme in this one is dead
celebrities, if that helps.

Well, did any of them
die on today's date?

Maybe that's a fucking clue.

The dates.

That's actually not a bad idea.

Nice, Christen.

My birthday.

Look for today's date
30 years ago. / Yes.

This stack is all 1990s.

'70s.

Oh! I got the '80s.

Perfect. / Yes!

Okay...

All right, who's got October 13th?

Ah, got it.

Yes, right here.

That's it.

All right, it wants one word.

All right, how many letters? / Nine.

Nice. / All right, the clue is...

"narcissistic notes."

Interesting.

I'm glad we got an easy one.

All right, well, uh, shut me in the room

and I'll put in words
until I figure it out.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We started in there.
Let us take this one.

Tyler.

Conrad, this is gonna involve

some quick problem-solving on the fly

and I'm not really sure
that's your forte.

Whoa, whoa.

What?

You can let someone else
do something, Tyler.

All right.

All right.

Oh! I got it.

"Egomaniac."

Actually, that could work.

Yes.

Well...

Damn it.

Narcissistic notes.

Something about letters... memos.

Ego's memos.

That has an apostrophe.

So? / So it's definitely not the answer.

Oh. What if note isn't to do
with something written?

What'd you mean?

Like a musical note?

Like what is a narcissistic's song?

Oh, looks like Anderson needs a hug.

Oh, what about egotistic?

Yeah, I'll try it.

Oh!

What is Carly Simon's "You're So Vain"?

That definitely won't fit.

Also, this isn't Jeopardy, so...

Well, you come up with
something, smart guy.

Whatever it is, it's your theme song.

What did you say? / Huh?

Nothing, just that my wife is
stuck up and she doesn't know...

No, not that. / I love you.

Try this.

T.

T? Okay, T. / Yes.

H. / H.

E. / E.

M. E.

Theme song.

Theme song. / A-B-C-D-E-F...

Yes!

Yes!

Yes!

Ha!

Nice. I'll go let 'em out.

If they want to get out. /
I'll never get used to that.

Oh, who's the protective big brother?

Stop.

I love how when you pretend
to have a conscience...

I said fucking stop!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Hey! Fuck!

What's wrong?

The key broke off in the fucking door.

What do you mean it broke?

I tried to open it and it wouldn't open.

Damn it. / You disappoint me.

Really, Anderson? / Jesus.

I don't see...

That's a little much.

Whoa! So fancy.

You're gonna have to sit tight

'til we can figure how to get you out.

Wait.

What's that?

It's all part of the game, right?

Yeah. That's weird.

What?

We solved the puzzle.
Why would the door close again?

Well, maybe...

maybe there's something else
that we have to do?

That doesn't make sense.

Wait.

Something's wrong.

What is that?

It looks like it's burning them.

Like... acid.

Oh, my God!

Oh!

Tabby! Tabby!

Holy shit! / What the fuck
is happening to them?

Tabby! No! / Oh, shit...

Tabby!

Ah! / Fuck!

Damn it!

What is happening? / Tabby!

Something's happening to them!

No! / Oh, my God!

Tabby! / Oh, my God!

Tabby!

Get down!
Get on the floor!

Oh, my God!

Tabby! / Oh, shit!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! / Fuck! Fuck!

Oh, my God...

Holy shit. / Tabby!

Conrad! / What the fuck is going on?

Oh, my God! / Tabby!

What is this?
What is this?

Tabby? Tabby!

Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

Fuck! / Fuck!

Fuck.

What the fuck is this place?

No.

What did you do?

I didn't...

I didn't do anything.

It locked on its own!

I-I-I tried to open it.

No, you fucked it up
and look what happened.

You couldn't do anything!
/ I tried to help them!

Look at you!

I tried to help them.

No.

Don't hurt her.

No.

It's real.

It's all real. / Real?

What are you talking about?
Of c... of course...

Why would Christen bring us here?

Christen's in trouble, too.

Then why the fuck isn't
she in the room with us?

She's locked in a
fucking cage, Anderson!

Christ.

It's not a game.

We have to get out of here.

Help me!

Fuck!

Fuck! Fuck!
There's no way!

What? So... so we're trapped?

There's no puzzle to get us out of here?

Fuck these puzzles!

All these rooms are enclosed.

Yeah. We figured that out
a long time ago.

What are you getting at? / Which means
there must be some sort of ventilation.

Here!

Fuck. / I'm here.

Take this.

We have to go.

No way.
No fucking way!

Do you want to get out of here?

Did you see what just
happened to Conrad and Tabby?

There's got to be another
way to open up the door.

Do you really want to wait
around and figure it out?

What if there is
no way to open the door?

What if it's just a matter of time

until this entire place
fills up with more acid fog

and we fucking fry, Anderson?

I'm going.

What? / I'm going.

We're going.

Tash. / I got... I gotta go.

Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

The vent turns.

Just keep moving.

I'm coming!
I'm right behind you.

Anderson! / Fuck!

There's something up ahead.

Like it could be an opening.

Anderson.

What?

It's another fucking puzzle.

Fuck is with this shit?!

Let's just go back!

No! There's a puzzle, we'll solve
it, we'll get out of here.

Get out of my way! / Shit!

Jesus!

Fuck!

Shit!

It's fine, we're getting out.
We just gotta...

we gotta...

I don't understand this.

Okay. Maybe it's...

No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

Shit. / Why the fuck...

God damn it, Natasha! / I didn't know!

Fuck! / Move!

Help... Let me see it!
Let me see it! / Fuck!

Shut up! Fuck. / Fuck.

Move! / No!

Fuck! / Just let me see it.
I can do this.

No, shut up! / Tyler!

Fuck! / Move, he's good at these things.

Fuck.

It's the Greek riddle of the Sphinx.

Well, then answer it. / Hang on!

Did you hear that? / What?

What? / Just, shh!

Just listen.
You hear it?

Yeah, I hear it.

Oh, my God, it's getting louder.

Anderson! / It's getting louder!

Anderson! / Okay, okay, okay.

Um, find a sun. / Okay.

Put it next to the sunrise.

Good, good. Next.

Now find a star and put it next to that.

Yes! / All right.

Next one, next one. Come on!

An infant. / What?

A baby! A fucking baby! / Okay, where?

Put it next to that.

Okay. Next.
Next one, come on!

All right. / Hurry! Just hurry!

An old man! / Here, here, here!

Fuck.

Fuck! / What?

What the? Something just
shut the duct behind me.

Are you okay? / No! What the fuck is it?

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! / Come on!

My leg is stuck. / Go!

My leg is stuck!
My leg is stuck!

Help me! Help me!
Oh, my God! Help!

Oh, my God!

No.

Here!

No...

No!

Are you fucking serious?

Anderson!

Anderson, come on!

He's not coming.

We're gonna die in here.

We're gonna die in here.

We're gonna die.

He knew.

What?

Anderson knew.
He had to know.

I wanted him to know.

I wanted him to get mad at me.

I wanted to feel something.

Jesus fucking Christ.

He never said anything.

Hey!

Pull your shit together!

Oh, my God.

Oh... oh, oh!

Oh, my God!

Why are all these wires
coming out of the TVs?

Tyler.

These. They're primary colors.

It's gotta be another
fucking puzzle, right?

I mean, look at them.

Yes.

Yellow and red make orange.

And blue and yellow make green.

And green and orange are left.

It has to be. Yes.

No!

What the fuck?

Fuck.

What do we do? / I don't know.

What the fuck do we do? / I don't know!

It's all part of the game, Tyler.

You always know the answer.

What the fuck do we do?
/ I said I don't know!

Exactly.
You don't know.

You think you're so
fucking perfect, Tyler.

Shut up.

You think Christen didn't see
through your bullshit,

that everyone didn't know
what you were doing.

Shut the fuck up!

She knew.

"Teddy Bear Picnic." / What?

Only Christen would know
that I fucking hate that song.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck!

We only have three minutes. / Shut up!

I feel something.
There's a handle.

Thank God.

Oh.
Fuck, fuck!

It locked again. / Shit!

Yes!

Oh, shit!

Fuck!

Fuck! Fuck!

What? / The door's too heavy,
I can't open it.

Come do this.

I'll open the goddamned door.

Okay.

I think I feel something.

Do it!

What happened?

The mouth started closing on my arm.

You hold it, I'll hold the door open,

and when I say "go," you run.

There's no time to waste, Natasha!

Okay, okay!
Jesus.

Now!

It's closing! It's closing!

It's closing, Tyler!
It's closing!

Just a little bit more! /
It's closing on my arm!

It's closing on my arm, Tyler!

Oh, it's closing!

Just a little more.

Oh, my God! Hurry!

It's cutting my arm, Tyler!

Stop, Tyler!
It's gonna break my arm.

Stop opening it!

It's closing, it's closing!

I'm sorry.

Fuck!

Fuck!

Christen.

Can you hear me? / Yes.

Are you okay?

I'm fine. / Okay.

What is this, Christen?

What?

What is this?

What are you talking about?

Why did you bring us here?

What do you mean?

Why did you bring us here?

I didn't do anything.

I didn't know. I wasn't...

Have you been watching this whole time?

Tyler..

Saw them all die?

Is that your fucking idea?

Did you plan that?

They're all dead because of you.

I... How could you say that?

Don't, Tyler. It's...

How could you say that?

My sister is dead.
My sister is dead!

Because of you.
Is this some sort of sick joke?

No. / Tell me.

Tyler. / Oh, oh.

So I assume you had... you had
nothing to do with this?

No! I woke up in this cage.

I don't fucking believe you, Christen.

I just want this to be over.

You think I can't tell
when you're lying to me?

I didn't do anything.
/ I'm so... I'm so...

Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't hear you, Christen.

You know, because I can't hear
anything over fucking lies!

Tyler, what's happening? / You're lying!

Believe me! / There's no time, Christen.

Tyler! / No! Say it!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Why did you fucking bring us here?

There's no time, Christen!
Say it!

Say it!

Say it!

Now! Say it!

Tyler!

Oh... No!

No!

I don't know how to get to you.

Tyler.
What do I do?

What do I have to do?

I love you.

911, state your emergency?

Yes...

Tell me what's going on.

I was... I was taken.

My friends... I-I-I think
they were, um...

I don't know where they are.
/ Okay, ma'am, ma'am?

I think they were maybe...
/ I need you to slow down.

Can't tell where I am. /
Take a deep breath for me.

Okay, I show you're on the corner

of Central and East Third Avenue.

I'm sending a patrol car
now to help you.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. / Okay?

I need you to stay on the line
with me, all right?

Can you do that? / Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Okay, what is your name?

Christen Wills.

And what happened, Christen?

We went to an escape room.

It was my boyfriend's birthday,
and um...

Hello?

Tyler was right.

They're all dead because of you.

Who is this?

Why?

Oh, no. Who I am is not
important at all.

No, but why... That is.

What do you mean?

You went looking for this.

Remember?

You do not hang up on me.

Don't do it.

Hi, there.

I'm watching you.

You found exactly what you
were looking for, didn't you?

A night of escape.

I let you watch.

You have one hour.

The police are coming.

Listen, when the cops get there,
just do me a favor.

I want you to tell 'em everything,

but if you and I are being
honest with each other?

I gotta tell ya, I doubt
they're gonna believe you.

You really can't help
yourselves, can you?

You people are so naÃ¯ve.

It's all part of the game, remember?

Who are you?
What did you do?

You should ask yourself this, Christen.

Who really escapes?

Was it you?

Or was it them?

...stay on the line.

Christen, can you hear me?

Ma'am, I need you to say
something if you can hear me.

Units are almost there.

If you can hear me,
you are going to be okay.

Stay with me, Christen.

Stay with me.
