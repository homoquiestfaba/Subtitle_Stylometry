What are you gonna do, kill me?

You can't kill
either now, can you?

Or yourself.

What a terrible,
terrible conundrum.

What news from the
mines, Harvard?

It ain't
pretty, darling.

We're gonna have to sell
something right quick then.

Fargo's calling.

We ain't gotta sell nothing
but Religion, sunshine.

This town's gonna be bigger
than God's illegitimate son.

How you reckon that?

We gonna throw
ourselves a card game.

More whiskey!

This could get ugly.

Not on account of us.

Leave the bottle.

Yes, sir.

You know those hombres?

I've seen them cut down
ten men without taking

their lips off of whiskey.

That's why I
ain't involved.

Pulp of whiskey.

Hey, son.

You're blocking our view.

Then move yourself.

Mustn't value your life way
you's running that mouth'll.

No, I just don't
value yours.

Do you know who I am boy?

A dead man, I reckon.

Would you
settle their tab?

Why don't you play
something, piano man?

God bless, John.

Raise.

Color me cracked, but I
just might call that.

I'm sorry.

I thought that was mine.

Shall we complete the play?

Look at all of these
distinguished gentlemen

come to the party.

A cognac, darling, and
whatever corn juice this

Darwinian misstep imbibes.

Read 'em and weep.

Dear, dear, the
suicide king.

And just when the
felicitous and fortunate

Salt Peter has the only card
that can bring about its demise.

Gentlemen...

Hey, you ain't
taking my money.

But you can't
take it with you.

This says I can.

I'm not presently heeled.

You're gonna die.

You got something
smart to say about that?

My valise, darling.

Thank you.

To you, my ace
in the hole.

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Salt Peter...

Have you heard of this?

What do we have here?

A high stakes poker game
in Religion, Arizona.

Why, that just
sounds divine.

Hands up.

Both hands.

Should've stayed working on the
railroad instead of robbing 'em.

You got two guns on you
now, and that poster says

alive or dead.

Whichever I prefer.

Say your prayers,
Chinaman Dan.

You first.

Leave gun.

Only one shot.

Give bag.

Drop belt.

Don't kill me, mister.

I promise I won't say
nothing to nobody.

Go away.

This bloody country.

It goes on forever.

No sense to it all.

I beg to differ.

There's a freedom in
it's wild, open spaces.

Freedom is an illusion
created by servants to

help them sleep at night.

Illusion...

Now you're speaking
my language.

Impressive.

Can you make my writing
assignment disappear as well?

What story are
you covering?

There's a poker
tournament in Religion.

How providential.

I am one of its
participants.

Edward James,
New York James.

Raven McCabe.

Magician at large.

Next time, pay the bill!

What'll it be?

Red wine.

Jackeroo John, right?

Saint John.

Mighty biblical
for these parts.

I'm a man of god now.

That's not what I heard.

Yeah, people change.

The only change men make
around here is from the

living to the dead.

Drum up some business.

-Bess!
-Hey!

Sorry!

Gimme some neck oil.

You gotta stop endangering
my customers.

Ever known me to miss?

There's always
a first time.

Not when I'm shooting.

Takin' my leave
for a spell.

Well, don't be gone long.

You ain't my Pappy,
Southern Bill.

As long as you owe back
rent on that hook house

you're running under my
roof, I am your Pappy.

Two whiskies.

Extra thirsty are we?

We don't do credit.

Well, Southern Bill
at your service.

Bed, booze, broads.

I provide 'em all.

I'm Waylin Smith.

I got word of a card game.

That's Harvard
Gold's affair.

How do I enter?

Go over at the Grand Hotel,
pay your fee, and sign up.

I don't know how I let you
pluck me from my station.

Sisters of Divine
Mercy.

I broke up with God
for you, Harvard.

He didn't build your
own town now, did he?

Numbers don't lie.

Religion can't afford the
gold prize staked on this

foolish card game.

It's hardly a mere card
game now, darling.

Got a reporter from the
New York Times doing a

major story about it.

Well the folks a comin' better
enjoy spending money.

Card players always
lavish their funds about.

And what about
the gunfighters?

They like their double
barreled discounts.

I'll have myself
a new lawman.

A Marshal from
Kansas City.

Just one?

That's all we can afford.

What's he gonna do?

Protect our money, honey.

Whoa!

You shouldn't sneak up
on folks in these parts.

Accept my humble
apologies.

I'm Bobby Shea.
Traveling carpenter.

Bootstrap Bess.

I don't shake hands.

I saw you lookin'
at this plot.

You fixin' to build
somethin' on it?

My own hotel.

A respectable kind.

For well-heeled
tourists and the like.

Built the Gold Hill Hotel in
Virginia City, near on my own.

What brings you
to Religion?

Just looking for the
next town on the map.

Aim to see the whole
wide world someday.

Well I'll keep you in mind,
Shea, if'n I raise the funds.

You got a plan
on that account?

Gonna win the big
poker tournament.

Mr. Salt Peter,
how are you, sir?

Royal, my dear.

I've traveled far and
wish to be installed.

Will you be staying long?

Not in this rabbit warren.

I'm sorry, sir.

Be forewarned, I like my
amenities and men that tease.

The presidential suite is
available if you so desire, sir.

Is it king sized?
Because my appetites are.

Yes, it is, sir.

You may follow our
bellman to your quarters.

I like the
view already.

Sorry, we don't
serve your kind.

Serve him.

What can I do for you?

Food, drink...

Pretty lady.

I can help you
with the first two.

And I can provide
the third.

You angry about
something, preacher?

Nothing you need
concern yourself with.

Sources tell me you're a
genuine man of the people,

Marshall Stone.

I aim to please, and
my aim is pleasing.

That it is.

When there's call for it.

We frown upon
violence in Religion.

Unless it's
necessary, of course.

You're gonna need some
deputies, Mr. Gold,

on account of the
influx of visitors.

Yeah, as budget allows.

There is one Zain Mohammed,
honest to God Arabian Prince.

Certainly does
advertise his wealth.

Yes, he does.

And that is how the stars
aligned to produce the

handsome product
you find before you.

I'm doing an article for
a prominent publication.

Might be a book on it.

Well, I will allow you
thoroughly behind the scenes.

For the good of the
story, of course.

I am not a homosexual
Mr. Peter.

Neither am I.

Mr. James!

Once again, a multitude
of thanks for lending

Religion your
considerable talents.

Well I am here
for the story.

If the bank cheque clears.

Meet my better
half, Roberta.

Enchanted, Mr. James.

We expect great
things from your pen.

Well, I see you met Mr.
Peter, one of our more

colorful participants.

Yes, yes, indeed I have.

He is in the room
opposite ours.

Yes, I was thinking
perhaps the three of us

could enjoy each other
the way the French do.

Mr. Peter!

You are so indulgent.

Now, if you would be so kind
as to recommend me a Doctor.

But, of course.

Are you ill?

Not quite yet.

Well, we invite you both
to join us this evening

for the declaration of
the tournament rules.

And the Gold's
make the rules?

In this town, yes.

We are the very
model of Capitalism.

All we want is a clean,
fair game, gentlemen.

A fair poker game.

Well, that would
be a first.

Follow the Jack of Diamonds and
win your very own diamond.

Who will be the first
to test their luck and

increase their
personal fortune?

Make your
choice, good sir.

Better luck next time.

Game of chance?

What's the stakes?

Name it, my friend.
I'm a betting man.

I'll bet you don't see
morning if you try to palm

that diamond off
as a real thing.

I stand by my
production, sir.

You do your trick then.

It's two bits.

I make my deals in blood,
cardsharp.

The cards stuck together.

You dirty huckster.

These are legitimate
games of chance.

Do I have a game
of chance...

There's a Russian descent.

Is there a dispute here?

Not with the law, marshal.

All firearms must be
turned in the sheriff's

station at the start
of the tournament.

Gentlemen, they'll be
announcing the rules in

front of the saloon in about
a quarter of an hour.

Lucky break, traveler.

My fine good fellows and
esteemed womenfolk, I am

please to declare the
first annual World Poker

Tourney in the dynamic
city of Religion, Arizona.

We are making
history here tonight!

The prize is a pure gold cross,
worth a yearly salary

of ten hardworking men.

We will be adhering to the
rules of five card stud poker.

You will each be issued
1,000 Religion poker chips.

You may buy them back one time
on the first evening only.

I will be the sole judge.

And cheating in any fashion
will not be tolerated.

I wish you all well, and
Religion welcomes you.

Who's thirsty?

Name?

Don't matter.

We all look same.

True.

Next.
Name.

Bear Johnson.

What do you want her for?

Tournament rules.

You'll get it back.

I better.

Bear Johnson.

I heard him.

What's the name
of your tailor?

I'd like to pay
him a visit.

Afterhours, of course.

I do not wish to
speak of such things.

Raise.

If you wish to speak
of such things, call.

An unfortunate
hand for you.

Chen.

Poker invented in China.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a last minute

entrant, who I only allowed
because he paid a penalty fee.

This here is Bobby Shea,
the carpenter.

Sorry I'm late.

I was getting
fitted for a suit.

You're throwing your
money away here, Bobby.

Two hands are
better than one.

Sometimes the best hand is
the one you don't play, son.

Same to you.

Off to a rollicking start.

Quite the cast
of characters.

And the setting?

How do you find our
little metropolis?

Very hospitable, but what
happens when the bullets

start flying?

Do you see any
firearms, Mr. James?

Well, not in plain sight.

Then we have ourselves
a peaceable proceeding.

And when the big
guns start losing?

Then they'll just have to
spend their money in the

humble little township.

Ever the optimist.

I never was one to the
see the glass half empty

or half full.

But the owner of the glass
and the price of whiskey.

I call your
trifling bet, fool.

Fool is more powerful than
the king as he is not

bound by the dictates
of the throne.

The fool lives to
play another day.

You got the guts
to play back, son?

Or you think I'm bluffing?

Don't lose your head.

That's what I thought.

It's a man's game, son.

Last hand, competitors.

Please bag your remaining chips
and leave them at the desk.

Well, my American friend,
it is down to you and I,

and I have more
chips than you.

I'm Viennese.

And you only have chips
because you bought 'em

back after I
relieved you of them.

It does not matter how one
begins, rather how one ends.

Are you finished talking?

Yes, Salt Pepper.

It's Salt Peter.

What a big hand.

And all I have is
this little deuce.

We're even my friend.

The royal we as it were.

Well...

Look at your
little outfit.

You think that's gonna
change anything?

I answer to a
higher power now.

You answer to me.

What are you
gonna do, kill me?

Well you can't kill me
either now, can you?

Or yourself.

What a terrible,
terrible conundrum.

Competition has ceased
for the evening.

Results will be
posted on the board.

Now go out and enjoy
yourselves in Religion.

How'd you end up in this god
forsaken town anyway, Mr. Shea?

I had a twin brother
named Tommy.

He died in my arms
some time ago.

Tommy?

Tommy!

Lost part of myself that
day I'll never get back.

You after that rancher
that killed him?

The law done got him.

He got a life in prison to
think about what he done.

And I got life outside
it to do the same.

Waylin! Get your mother
behind the wagon.

No!

No!

No!

Why?

Why?

I am called Iron Wolf.

Pale faced blood is poison,
but you are different.

You have Apache
spirit in you.

I will teach you to
live free on this land.

Now our blood flows as one
and the great spirit will

guide your actions.

Drink this.

I will teach you the ghost
dance and you will know

your purpose in this world.

I am your father now in
spirit as nature intended.

Who's there?

I got the hot water that
you asked for, Mr. Smith.

May I enter?

You may.

How are you finding
the accommodations?

Pleasing, thank you.

Anything further
that you require?

My eternal gratitude and a
fortune filled evening for you,

my good doctor.

Trust that your health
recovers at speed, sir.

It always does.

Well, what a
handsome sight.

My fellow competitors.

You may go.

Now we have a
proper threesome.

Your advances mean
nothing to me.

Just getting to know
who I'm playing with.

All part of the game.

But only one of us could win,
unless there are side games.

Which would be my pleasure
to host one in my suite as

I'm not partial to
sleep at this hour.

Count me in.

Prince?

You just gonna bat your eyes
or do you have the metal?

More than you can imagine.

You.

I like 'em small.

Come on!

Hey!

Leave her be, you jackal!

Or what, woman?

What the hell!

Keep the pistol,
lose the dead weight.

This is goodnight
then, Shea.

It has been an honor
and a privilege, Bess.

Don't get
sentimental on me.

Tomorrow's just another
day you can lose it all.

Or win it all.

Around the world, my darling,
it could all be ours.

If we play our
cards right.

Get out of here, Shea.

Saloon's closed.

See Bootstrap if
you fancy a room.

I'm not here for
the bed house.

Due to lock up, partner.

I'm not your
partner, bardog.

Now fetch me some
coffin varnish.

Don't you look black at me
and expect to see morning.

Them irons meant to
be with the Marshal.

Care to take 'em from me?

Settle down.

I get a little
balmy this hour.

Perhaps this
will awaken you.

Quite a tip.

I'll get you my best.

What is that?

Morphine.

Under strict
doctor's orders.

Fortunately, I
self-administer.

Are you ill?

About once every four
to six hours, yes.

Shall we play?

Yes, I would prefer, my
friend, you not deal the cards.

And whom do you suggest?

I would be more comfortable
with the prince dealing.

That is if you
would oblige us.

That I will.

As you like it gentlemen,
but be forewarned, I have

a photographic memory.

I don't miss a thing.

If you do a thing,
many, many times,

it becomes second nature.

And when it matters most,
you will do it again.

I can't tell what
matters most anymore.

The great spirit
will show you.

When?

When?

When you don't
question the time.

Who's the Injun?

Who are you?

Call me Saint John.

Eagle Wing.

What's your white name?

Waylin Smith.

You seem to have something
of a second sight.

Well versed in the occult.

Not by choice, was
thrust upon me.

You mean spirits and such?

Spirits, demons.

You mean Anton Stice?

That sorta demon?

That's right.

Right this way, Mr. Stice.

Mr. James.

Mr. James, rise and shine.

New day in Religion.

Mr. Edward James.

Trust we have not
disturbed your repose.

The truth is you have.

Mr. Anton Stice, the
current leader of our

little poker tournament,
has arrived for you.

Heard you been penning an
article on the subject.

Doing something
long form, as well.

How novel.

Well, you two will have
plenty to discuss then.

If you'll kindly excuse
me, Religion calls.

I understand the power
of word, Mr. James.

And it is you who will
write of these things.

Yes, well, I suppose it is
up to me to immortalize

the event as it were.

Would you be so kind
as to invite me in?

Yes, yes, please
do come in.

Morning, Mr. Peter.

Good morning.

A package has arrived
for you, sir.

Why, thank you.

Thank you all for
your test of skills.

Prince, your
breakfast is ready.

Trust he didn't
clean you out.

I let him win.

Is that right?

How much of my
money did you take?

We broke even to the coin.

I played you straight.

The prince is a great shot
and a fine card player,

but he's too proud
of his birthright.

An Achilles heel in an
otherwise formidable foe.

Why reveal this to a
fellow competitor?

In the right
circumstances, I believe

the shared victory is
the best stratagem.

You're quite handy
with the cards.

Perhaps we could work together,
share the winnings.

Perhaps.

I owe you some gold then
from tonight's game.

We're even my friend.

I miss nothing in the
matters of finance.

Ever heard of alchemy?

You switch the coins.

They switch themselves.

At a level beyond where
the mere eye takes you.

So you'd have me believe
you're an honest to god

magician then?

Do you believe in
honesty or god?

No.

Nobody believes in anything
nowadays except what they see.

I believe in everything unseen,
that is my magic, Salt Peter.

Hey.

Look what I found.

Where'd you get that?

Guess.

Scary guy?

Must be worth a lot.

We could run away with it.

We already ran away, Sadie,
and we ended up here.

You find yourself
a second place?

One step from
where I aim to be.

This Anton Stice, he's a
pretty serious competitor.

It's just another man with
two legs and something

dangling between them.

Yeah.

Well what I'm saying
is, be careful.

After all these years,
I've grown tolerant of you.

You getting soft on
me, Southern Bill?

Gonna have my own hotel soon,
and you can come work for me.

That'll be the day.

Hey there,
preacher man.

Can we help you find god?

We accept donations,
too, just like church.

Ain't nothing
for you here.

Don't judge us.

We's working girls.

Go on.

Can we talk a
moment, Saint John?

I suppose.

I know greed is one
of them deadly sins,

but I can't avoid it.

I wanna win
that gold cross.

Why is that?

For Bess.

I love her.

Then it's not the
cross you want, it's Bess.

So when you do something
for someone else's gain,

it ain't greed?

It's greed either way, Bobby.

I just wanted to
build her that hotel.

Why's that?

I saw how much her
heart wanted it.

You know, Bobby, I think
you're the only one

playing this game for
the right reasons.

-Name?
-Waylin Smith.

Come play.

Not now, sweetie. Later.

Can I have your
autograph, Mr. Smith?

What for?

You're famous.

Sure thing, partner.

Hey, what's your name?

Dani Boyd.
I want you to win.

Well, thank you, Danny.

That's for you.

Be careful of
your mortal ego.

They hinder your spirit.

Don't break me up in pieces
here, I'm just one person.

Are you?

Thank you, sir.

Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the traveling

bare knuckle champion,
Mr. Roland Dunn.

Yeah!

And now, number one, undefeated
challenger, Sam Samson.

Gentlemen...

Show time, gentlemen.

You like that?

You want some more?

Here, you like that?

You got nothing!

Come on, hit him!

Hit him!

Come on, now.

Yeah!

We have a champion,
ladies and gentlemen!

Roland!

Knuckles!

Day two will now commence.

The hotel bar is stocked
with the finest of

imported refreshments.

So enjoy yourselves, one and
all, and let's play poker!

Your eyes reveal the depths
of pain, Mr. Smith.

I trust it's not because of
the hand you've been dealt.

Trust has nothing
to do with it.

Just want you gentlemen to know
you're playing for second place.

I'm a flying high today.

I am surrounded
by bearded men.

Could we call in
the town barber?

I'd like to see
a gent's face.

Quit your jaw
flapping, missy.

I only quit when the
game is over and

I'm declared the victor.

The room was filled with
tension and anticipation.

Be careful.

This is not an
ordinary man.

He has access to the
world between worlds.

I cannot make my
appearance known to him.

That man is energetically
bound to this one.

He lives off
his life force.

How you faring, Magus?

Breaking even.

No intermingling.

You wanna live to see the next
round, you keep your mouth shut.

A is for apple,
B is for boy,

C is for captain
who says, ahoy!

One more word and I
knock your teeth out.

Should I handle this?

A little drama's
good for the show.

D is for deadly,
E is for end,

F is for fortune
on which we depend.

G is for gorgeous,
H is for haggard.

I is for individuals
known to be braggers.

J is for joker,
K is for king,

L is for lackeys that
hang by a string.

M is for missed by a
whole country mile.

That's two M's my friend
and one more if you smile.

The rules clearly state that
violence against a fellow

player will not be tolerated.

Bear Johnson has been removed
from the tournament.

After the break, we will
resume with our final tables.

You're doing very
well, Waylin.

Thank you, but I've
got a long way to go.

The paper says your half
Indian, is that true?

In a manner of speaking.

What would be your
plans for any winnings?

I intend to employ my
winnings to a number of

charitable organizations.

Connected to my non profit
corporation Stice United.

Very commendable,
Mr. Stice.

Very commendable.

History is written by
the victors, old sport.

I take it is.

Still in it, I see, Bobby.

Just barely.

Made a few mistakes,
but I'm learning quick.

Halt.

Chinaman Dan,
AKA Daniel Chen.

You're wanted by the law
for the federal crime of

train robbery.

I am here and now apprehending
you, dead or alive.

A little blood.

I don't believe
in your laws.

Believe in this,
I never miss.

Should we send a posse?

This is a federal matter.
Clear the street.

Ladies and gentlemen, legends
have been created in this town.

I tell you, legends of the
wild west right here in

Religion and you all have
the best seat in town.

And I will sing.

Yes, I will sing
praises to the lord.

And with acceptance, we
can rejoice and he will

offer us eternal life.

To save us from
the fires of hell.

The devil himself is in Religion
and no one can beat him.

The magician?

His tricks won't save him.

Or the Ingun gunfighter.

Too slow for the
prince of darkness.

And what about the other
prince, the Arabian...

All he's done is show
us his fancy clothes.

Fancy clothes, boy.

I got my fancy clothes on.
I like...

You mock me,
little fingers man?

No, sir.

I'm immortalizing
your character.

Now, what have we here?

I'm Zain Mohammed.
Prince of Asir.

I could not help but note,
prince, that you are not

in Asir at the moment.

You are not half
the man that I am.

I beg to differ.

I challenge you to a duel.

But the marshal
has our weapons.

Religion's gonna be a major
metropolitan center someday,

my darling.

People will come far and
wide to see our little,

my little flower
in the dessert.

I believe it, Harvard.

Once upon a midnight dreary,
will I pondered weak and weary.

Over many a quaint and curious
volume of forgotten lore.

This should
be intriguing.

Indeed.

One.

Two.

Looks like the odds
are shifting, Bobby.

-Three.
-You wait here.

Four.

Five.

Your weapon, Mr. Stice.

Wasn't mine to begin with?

What sort of magic was that?

Black.

What color do you practice?

Grey.

Take the prince to
the doctor at once.

Stice.

It was a gentlemen's duel.

The results
were not fatal.

Zain Mohammad is
disqualified for producing

weapons during the gaming.

Anton Stice will
not be penalized.

Is he a better shot
than you, Waylin?

No, he ain't.

Told you, mom!

Your competitors are dropping
like flies, Mr. Gold.

But you got your
story, yes, Mr. James?

I have all that and more.

You will not be
disappointed.

Well, then the players
are exchangeable.

Some more exchangeable
than others it would seem.

Such is life in Religion.

Got work matters now, Bobby?

Good work, girls.

You are paving the way
to a brighter future.

Hey, look what
I found, Bess.

Who'd you pluck this
from, little Jill?

That Anton fellow when he was
gabbing with the reporter man.

You're a good
little witch.

My favorite of the bunch.

Now back to work girls and
steer clear of that Stice

character unless you
hear different from me.

Yes, ma'am.

Tonight we will decide
which of our players are

skilled enough to do
battle on the final table.

Let the playing begin.

So what's it gonna be,
carpenter?

I think you're bluffing.

Why don't you put your
money where your mouth is?

I call.

Can't keep a
good man down.

Yes you can.

You're just delaying
the inevitable, Shea.

Feel the big pay day coming.

All in.

Bootstrap, such an
extravagant display of wealth.

Prefer to watch you
roll about in it.

Right behind you, Salt.

I'm gonna call.

I got you dead
to rights, missy.

Name's Bootstrap.

Deal the card.

There she is.

Why did you make that bet?

You in cahoots
with the dealer?

Get your hands off her.

Well what are you
gonna do, little man?

Yeah!

That's what you get for
messing with Roland Dunn.

A mouth full of fists
for dinner, boy.

Hit him, Bobby.
Choke him out!

Finish him!

This man put hands
on our Bess.

Toss him in jail!

And Shea?

He was protecting Bess.

Is he still in
the tournament?

Yes, yes he is.

Ain't love grand?

It can be, yes.

You ever known it to last?

Hope spring's eternal.

Delusion, as well.

You're gonna win
this, Bessie.

Yes, you are.

Yes, you are, my girl.

Go away. I'm indisposed.

I know what you have in
there, and believe me,

you don't want it.

Come in.

What are you
nosing about for?

I'm a dead man, but you
needn't go down my road.

Anton Stice, he's gonna
make you choose between

your world desires and what love
you have left in your heart.

How's he gonna do that?

By giving you
what you want.

Here, take it.
I don't want it no more.

It's not mine to take.

I just wanna live
a simple life.

You can still do that.

But I'll still aim to win.

Man is a bundle of
contradictions.

It's how he's so
easily defeated.

In case you haven't
noticed, I ain't no man.

But you hold a man's
fate in your hands.

A man who's willing to
die for you if need be.

Anton Stice is gonna visit
you tonight and I'm afraid

that nothing I've said here
can prepare you for that.

Bess.

Bess, I know
you're in there.

Innocence is
wasted on the innocent.

Ain't that right, Bess?

Good lord, you
gave me a fright.

Not my intention.

You don't strike me as the
card playing type, Saint John.

I've done my fair share of
gambling unfortunately.

So it's true what
they say then.

That you once robbed banks
and left a trail of dead

men in your wake.

No, it ain't true
what they say.

Well...

It is a comfort.

It's much worse.

I ain't coming out.
I don't care what you say.

I'll kill everybody in here.

You shut up.

You keep your mouth shut.

I'll kill you,
I swear to god.

Keep withdrawing the
neck tie committee.

Who the hell are you?

Those won't help you now.

And you can?

If you follow me.

Where the hell am I
supposed to follow you to?

The salvation.

Evening, Mr. Smith.

I see I scared
your Ingun off.

What do you want Stice?

I could ask the
same of you.

Would you like
anything Mr. Stice?

I'll have what
he's having.

I hear you're
quite the shot.

I do what needs doing.

Well now we have
something in common.

We ain't got nothing
in common, Stice.

Except part in
a card game.

That's enough
now, isn't it?

Salt Peter!

Care to join us?

Not you.

I didn't know you swung
that way, Miss Peter.

Well, you know what
I always say...

There's enough Salt
Peter for everyone.

We have work to do,
my friend.

Treating these folks
like some kind of gods.

Ain't natural.

A few days ago, they was
just a bunch of low lives.

Interesting.

As a fantasy.

With a little alchemy,
it could be real.

Dreams and reality
walk hand and hand.

Indeed.

Bill.

What in the hell has
gotten into you two?

This thieving scoundrel
stole my diamond.

You wretched liar. It was
my diamond to begin with!

Lock 'em up.

And the diamond?

That, too.

I'm gonna fetch Mr. Gold,
and get to the bottom of this.

Watch them.

Yes, sir.

Could you take
this for me?

I fear this criminal
might steal it.

What time is it?

What is this?

It isn't real.

You're merely
dreaming all of this.

Asleep right now on
a comfortable bed.

On a comfortable bed.

On a comfortable bed.

Did you get those numbers?

Like a photograph,
my friend.

Those two are essential
components to our final table.

They was at each other's
throats over stolen goods.

We cannot afford to
lose them, marshal.

I'm just doing my job.

There he is.

Ringmaster of the fine
circus called Religion.

I heard you two had yourself
a disagreement this morning.

Seems I have a similar
diamond to Mr. McCabe.

If memory serves, I've
left it in Vienna.

We've mutually apologized
and all is forgetten.

Yeah.

Must've consumed
a large supper.

Liquid supper, perhaps.

Well, case is solved then.

Unlock 'em, marshal.

If this was my town,
I'd have you hung.

Well thank
goodness it's not.

Anton Stice cannot be
harmed by ordinary means.

I'll stay clear of him.

But if he crosses me,
I've always got this.

Can I see it?

It's okay.

It's a nice piece.

Use it wisely.

Hey, Saint John.

Yeah?

Let's keep this
amongst ourselves.

Don't sneak up
on me, Bobby.

I ain't sneaking,
Bess, I'm walking.

It's how I get around.

Still see it here,
how about you?

Don't know.

Maybe.

That's not the
Bootstrap I know.

Look, I got a one in
seven chance to win this.

With you that
makes two in seven.

That's not how
odds work, Bobby.

We make our
own odds, Bess.

This could be a
beautiful hotel.

Just leave me be, Bobby.

Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed colleagues and

members of the
international press.

I'm proud to announce the
final table in Religion,

Arizona's first official
world poker tournament.

Our competitors, in
ascending order according

to their positions.

In seventh place, we have
the journeyman carpenter,

Bobby Shea.

In sixth place,
we have the reformed bank

robber turned
preacher, Saint John.

Nice hand, John.

For us both.

In fifth place, we have
the magic man himself,

renowned illusionist,
Raven McCabe.

In fourth place, we have
the half Ingun gunfighter,

Waylin Smith.

Where's your friend?

Gone the way of the ghost?

Every ghost was once
flesh and blood, Anton.

Just like you and I.

I thought we had
nothing in common.

In third, we have the
most colorful dandified

character to ever
step foot in Religion.

By way of Vienna,
Salt Peter!

Woo!

The crowd
adores me and I them.

You are addicted
to their praise.

I embrace my
addictions, sir.

They are my traveling
companions.

In second place,
we have the formidable,

but charitable cardsharp,
Anton Stice.

And a charitable
applause as well.

I haven't forgotten
about you yet.

How could you?

And finally, the fastest
draw God ever gave a woman,

the madame to end all madames,
our very own Bootstrap Bess!

How bad you want it?

Bad as I need to.

Check.

All in.

Call.

I see that bet.

I think I'll stick around.

Call.

Full dance card, gents.

Raise.

I can't tell what
matters most anymore.

The Great Spirit
will show you.

When?

When you don't
question the time?

Still with us, gunfire?

Fold.

Not this time.

Was that to me?

Guess I should call then.

I do believe we will thin out
the pretenders with this hand.

Call.

We're gonna build us that hotel
if it's the last thing we do.

All in.

This has gotten
away from me.

Victory always
comes at a cost.

I turn this one over
to the fair lady.

Back to the
wood shed, Shea.

Take it away, Bobby.

A fitting hand
before our break.

Now one and all, please
enjoy the culinary

comforts of Religion and
prepare to return for our

final table.

We will crown our victor
on this very evening!

You can't win 'em all.

Don't go too far.

Don't intend to.

We need to talk, friend.

This game is
taking too long.

The doctor calls
presently.

Dear god.

If I believed in you,
you would feel like this.

What took you so long?

Gaze upon me.

Know
what you just saw?

Tuesday?

You cannot deny what is in
front of your own very eyes.

I'm not in the
business of denying.

Do you know who I am?

I know who you think you
are, but to Salt Peter,

you're no one
in particular.

But I deal in particulars.

I can't deliver until you,
my friend, the deepest of

all your mortal desires.

I already do
that on my own.

I can also
terminate your life.

That will also
happen without you.

You are a strange
sort, Mr. Peter.

I can see my work's
been done here.

Fresh?

Yeah, more or less.

Mr. Anton Stice.

They say he's the devil.

They say a lot of
things in Religion.

I believe it.

My, my, my.

Aren't you the most
angelic thing I ever did see?

Give me your hand.

Don't touch her.

Don't you ever,
ever defy me, woman.

Anton Stice!

Mr. Smith.

Get away from them.

Now.

Or what?

We'll send you
straight to hell.

And the drama continues.

Let's hope it
hastens the game.

Well I accept
your challenge.

That's a nice piece.

Use it wisely.

Whenever you're ready.

How about now?

Good god,
the odds of that!

Come on.

Come on.

Take your best shot.

You are unusually
courageous.

A man can die once
or a thousand times.

I see you've already
made your decision.

Now, marshal.

Gentlemen, this little
breach in our rules has

complicated our game.

And what hastens?

I'm withdrawing
from the tournament.

What for?

Another life.

Are you okay, Bess?

I'm okay, Bobby.

A heartwarming
twist of fate.

Indeed.

And what of Anton Stice?

He's still in play.

Some men make the rules
and some men break them.

The right ones
do, Mr. James.

Interesting how right and
might are so closely related.

Enough material
for your novel?

Very close, Miss Gold.

Very close.

Well do stick around.

Every great story
has a great ending.

Pity only one of us can win.

But that is the way of
the world now isn't it?

There are more worlds
than this one.

There are many things not
spoken of in polite company.

Right, Bess?

Play the hand.

We ain't here to
talk this out.

Let's let the cards decide
who is worthy of the victory.

Your fates hang on a
mere game of chance.

My kind of odds.

Who do you reckon wins?

Religion wins, Bill.

That was always
the outcome.

Well, well.

We find ourselves at
the witching hour.

Time to see what
you are all made of.

Check.

Interesting.

I think you
dropped something.

Some dreams were
never meant to be.

I raise. All in.

Odds are two in
five, right Bobby?

That's right.

Wasted on the innocent.

Right Bess?

All in.

I see you remember what
game you're playing.

I know what I'm doing.

This is what I live for.

Well it looks like we got
ourselves a showdown.

Let the cards decide.

The moment of
truth is upon us.

Must
be my lucky day.

In cahoots, I see?

You know the game well.

This is goodnight then.

Well.

A marvelous and
enchanting occasion.

I thank you all
for amusing me.

Drink that. It will
help with that cough.

Got ourselves an
even playing field.

You can't win
unless I let you.

And why would you do that?

Let's go in the alley.
We'll talk.

Careful, Bobby.

I know what I'm doing.

Mr. Shea.

I have an offer to make.

One time only deal.

If you accept it, all your
worldly desires will be

realized in this lifetime.

Riches and power.

The ability to bend the world
to your masculine will.

You can't promise
those things, Stice.

No man can.

I'm not a man, Shea.

I never was.

Who are you?

I'm sure you've heard the
stories from as far back

as your childhood.

Can't expect me
to believe that.

You believe in
god, don't you?

Yes.

Then why not me.

I believe you're a hustler
who is good with a gun.

Look into my eyes.

We will play til we have a
winner or we reach dawn.

Can't be.

The devil?

Here in Religion?

Is there a better
place to be?

Think of me as your
corporal ally.

Pulling the world's
strings in your favor.

In return for what?

Nothing you wouldn't
miss in this lifetime.

You tried to make this deal
with Bess, didn't you?

Bess is her own worst
enemy because she needs

a man like you to lead
her to her salvation.

I can do that on my own.

Can you?

A destitute carpenter?

One job removed
from the poorhouse?

I have made kings
out of paupers.

Gods of mere men.

Men can't interfere
with the will of god.

You wanna talk about will?

Well this is my will.

You take the cross,
you go get that hotel.

What if I don't take it?

Then I return in one month's
time and will bury you

with your brother.

And Bess.

We will play til we have a
winner or we reach dawn.

Whichever comes first.

When the cock crows, if we
do not have a victor,

we will play one final
hand for the gold prize.

All comes down to
this, Bobby Shea.

You have the power
to save two lives.

Deal me in.

Nothing like gold to bring
a man to his knees.

Last hand, gentlemen.

To the victor goes
the gold cross.

Highest chip stack wins.

Check.

I raise.

I call.

I raise.

Call.

I raise.

No point in turning
back now, Shea.

A betting's just
a formality.

Call.

Just one card away now.

Remember Bess.

Raise.

Got nothing.

I was told not to sneak up
on folks in these parts.

Love don't sneak, Bobby.

Disappears when you
least expect it.

We came so close.

But at what cost?

Don't seem possible
what happened.

Do you think he's
really who he says?

Think we are?

When all is said and done,
this whole world and all

that's in it is just
some kind of spell.

Who's spell?

Could be ours,
if we choose it.

We should just enjoy our
time here while we have it.

If we're together, Bobby,
we don't need the money.

I answer to a
higher power now.

You answer to me.

What are you
gonna do, kill me?

Well, you can't kill
either now, can you?

Or yourself.

Please, make room
for Mr. Stice.

He's had a long
day and night.

And remember, tell folks
about the fine town of

Religion when
you get home.

About that book
deal, Mr. Stice.

Don't you worry, Mr.
James, you'll get all

that's coming to you.

I thank you, sir.

I thank you for
all your help.

There will be time
to thank me later.

Now if you will excuse me.

You're not gonna need
that where you're going.

You lost this time, Anton.

The carpenter didn't
take your deal.

But this is where
things get interesting.

The tournament's finished.

I think it's best we just
leave Religion behind.

I have one more hand
for you, Saint John.

There ain't no more
hands left to play.

No?

How would you like your
immortal soul back?

That is what you most
desire now, isn't it?

What are you proposing?

You'll bring Shea to me in
exchange for the return of

your soul.

And a gold cross to boot.

To start a new life
with as a man of means.

Shea already
turned you down.

You will convince
him otherwise.

Will I ever see you again,
Salt Peter?

Probably not.

But you never know.

Let's go!

There goes Salt Peter.

Religion won't see the likes
of him in this town again.

Excuse me, Bess.

Where you going?

My stomach's bothering me.

I got something for that.

Just give me a minute.

I, for one, am
glad he's going.

I second that, darling.

You wish to save Bess?

I'll give anything.

Will you?

I'm ready to go with you.

You chose wisely, Shea.

Bess will not be harmed.

And you will give
your soul to me.

What do I have to do?

You step forward.

You're not gonna
kill me, are you?

Nothing of the
sort, my boy.

I will lose my sixes.

Now come to me.

Couldn't stand to
miss the last hand.

Salt Peter.

How amusing.

The self-serving hedonist
arrived to save the day.

Indeed.

And I will take his life before
I let you take his soul.

And what's in it for you?

Because we both know there's
always a little something.

Just the delightful pleasure
of seeing you lose, Stice,

and knowing I had a
hand in the trick.

I could shoot you in between the
eyes before you even blink.

But you've
lost your sixes.

Come now, what's your
price, mercenary?

You have nothing
to offer me.

Isn't this what you
were playing for?

Now you pick it up, you walk
away, and you have my word.

I will not harm you.

It's made of tin.

It's too late for
your petty games.

Gaze upon it.

That foul magician.

McCabe.

Is this what you're
looking for?

Three sixes, fool.

Just another dirty huckster.

An Achilles heel in an
otherwise formidable foe.

Indeed there is some
magic left in mortal men.

Pity we couldn't save him.

It's tragic.

Tragic is the way he
was living before.

He's free now.

Salt, are you acknowledging
the possibility of a soul?

Perhaps.

Gentlemen, it has been
a magical acquaintance.

A deal's a deal.

I will not stop until the
game is over and I am

declared the victor.

You deserve it, Mr. Peter.

I have no place
to put this.

Would you relieve
me of this burden?

I can't take this.

But you can.

Even I know love
most conquer all.

Go back to town.
Find your Bess.

And you, Mr. Peter?

I'm off the find
the next adventure.

And to die with a
smile on my face.

Bess, for once
you didn't draw.

What are you crying for?

I thought I lost you.

I never left you, darling.

The hotel meant
nothing without you.

Well, I guess we're
gonna need this now.

How you figure that?

I raised the finances.

It's a miracle.
How'd you do it?

How'd you do it?

God works in
mysterious ways, Bess.

And love comes when
you least expect it.

I see it all in my
mind now, Bobby.

Clear as day.

What should we call it?

The Redemption.

I like the sound of that.
