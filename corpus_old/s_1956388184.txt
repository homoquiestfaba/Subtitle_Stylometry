<i>â™ª A love that is soft and warm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know</i>
<i>There aren't many things in life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That I can hold on to</i>
<i>Because I've been let down so many times â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I found now</i>

<i>â™ª YouÂ brighten up my life â™ª</i>

fucking shit to say.

Now you wanna be quiet.

Now, when I got you
in front of my motherfucking face,

and I'm asking you questions...

I'm right here!

This is the fucking problem.

You don't show me no fucking respect,
and you don't listen.

I say the same shit to you

over and over and over and over again,

like I'm a motherfuking tape recorder.

Not to mention the fact that my apartment
smells like a fucking cow barn,

because ofÂ all your fucking
leather jackets.

And what is this, huh?

You're a grown ass man.

Open a fucking checking account.

Your name is Shaft, not Chase.

Nigga, I'm not gonna keep dealing
with thisÂ shit.

Now, I done told you,Â I don't know

who the fuck or what the fuck

you think this is.Â And you know what?


You think I like hearing myself,
repeat myself, repeat myself?

Hello? Are you even listening to me?

Course, I am, baby.

[sighs]
[Shaft] Come here.

Wanna do me a favor?


Oh, fuck, no!

Fuck, no!

Who the fuck do you think I am?

You think I'mma put my sanctified lips

[Maya shouting] Please don't!

[Maya groans]


[Shaft chuckles]
Girl, what's wrong with you?

[Maya panting]

You were saying something
about my bank account?

What the fuck was that?

What the fuck was that?
You said no one would hurt us here.

[Maya] Not in Harlem.
It's not my fault, Maya.


I can't... I can't. I can't. I'm not...

from all this.

No! Maya.
I gotta get him away from you!

Maya... don't do this.

[horn honks, siren wails]

What's going on over there?

It's an ambulance.<i> </i>I just...
I'm walkingÂ to the hospital.

Hospital? You good?

Do you mean, am I using?
[JJ] <i>No.</i>

No, that's not what I said.

I know you're looking out for me, man.
I appreciate that. Sorry.

I'm actually just going
for a routine check-upÂ with...

your favoriteÂ doctor, in fact.

Who? Sasha?
[Karim] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

Dang. Man, I bet she looks good in scrubs.

You know, I will tell her that
you've beenÂ thinking about that.

No. No, no, no. Come on. Don't do that.

No, J, you know I wouldn't do you
like that. Come on, now.

She might actually give you a shot.

I'm not an "agent" agent, per say.
I'm a dataÂ analyst.

Are you kidding me? Of course, I do.

Hey, Shaft.

Aye.
Conference room. Now.

Um, it's John, sir.

Okay, I gotta go.


Yeah, run shit, huh?



wants to ramp up cyberÂ surveillance
of potential terroristÂ threats.

Specifically, we are keeping an eye

on the Rashad Azzam MosqueÂ in Harlem,

and its cleric, Farik Bahar,

who's drawnÂ our attention with his
frequent trips to Afghanistan.

Now, we are going to need
a completeÂ digital blackout.

Is that clear?
[all] Yeah.

The last thing I need is that asshole
from Channel Eight news

spewing someÂ bullshit story
about Islamophobia

running rampant through the Bureau.

So heads on a swivel.

Okay, who wants lead on this?

Anyone else?

Wait, seriously? I can do this.

No. You can't.

Put me in the game, coach. I...

Listen, rookie. This isn'tÂ some bullshit
exercise they give you at the Academy.


There's a certain hierarchy here
you need to respect.

[low voice] Gotta give respect to get it.

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
What did you just say?

How the hell did you hear that?

Listen, kid, I don't have time to deal
with the latestÂ hotshot outta MIT

looking to flex his nuts.

I am dealing with daily terrorist threats,

the worst heroin epidemic
this city has ever seen,

and a seven yearÂ old daughter
who wants meÂ to call her "Frank".

You are a rookie.

Know your fucking role.

You want another?

Yeah, sure. Why not? [chuckles]

Can't say no to a $16 wells.

an FBI agent or something?

Yeah, well...

Uh... I'm actually...

more of a data analyst
rather than an "agent" agent,

I'm kind of like a cybersecurity

expert...

Okay, she left.

[Karim] Hm.
[chuckles]

Again, bro. If someone is asking
if you're an FBI agent,

just sayÂ you're an FBI agent, man.

[JJ] Hey, man.
[Karim] Good to see you.

Especially if she looks like that.

[Karim] Oh, I got you a little surprise.
Sasha!


Hey!
[JJ] What's up?

Oh, it's good to see you.

Oh, you know, when I heard
that you guysÂ were hanging out,

I had to invite myself.

Of course!

I mean, I can't even remember
the last time

the three of us were together.

What do you guys want to drink?
Let me...

Thank you. Well, I'll have a club soda.
Can I get a whiskey, please?


[Karim laughs] I'm serious.
What did you have to leave town for?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I had to send up some stuff

for, uh, my new business.

New business?
Wait.

He didn't tell you about
Brothers Watching Brothers?

No.

Yeah, damn. Okay, so...

It's this rehabilitation program

that me and my Army buddiesÂ started.

Basically the idea is to helpÂ vets
who were coming back,

who are going through

the same shitÂ that I went through,
with addiction,

and so just sort of helping them out,
get them on their feet.

Oh, shit.

That's... Yo, that's what's up.

There's something else, too.

Something else?

Like what?


Sorry, guys. I actually... I gotta go.

You gotta go?
[Karim] Yeah.

I gotta go. Some work stuff poppedÂ up.

You just said you're gonna
tell us something.

Yeah. And I'll just... text you
about it later in the week. I just...

There's something I gotta do.

Okay.

Yo! Karim.

You good?

What? Yeah. No, I'm fine.
Get back in there.

You said that you wanted to talk.
I figured we can talk right now.

No, man. No, that's...

I just want to say... uh, thank you.

Thank you for always being there for me,
for always...

you know, having my back.

Yeah.

Go in there, go have fun.
All right, I'm out.

Hey.

Hey, Ma. What's up?

Hey...

You okay?


Ma. Hey, what's wrong?


Um...


<i>He's dead.</i>



[Officer] Ready. Fire!
[gunshot]



he was using again.


any excuses for him, okay?

The police found him.

I don't care how they found him.

The light was back in hisÂ eyes.
You saw him.

You examined him, for Christ's sake.

Yeah. But my examination
doesn't negateÂ what the police found.

To them, he's just
another dead junkie vet.

We need to find out
what really happenedÂ to him.

Well, you're in the FBI, aren't you?

How you gonna ask me something like that?

You think I'm a snitch?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Well, I am.


How much cash you got on you?

Are you...

I don't know, actually.

Okay, I usually use Apple Pay.

Let's see... I... Um...

My gosh.

gets itÂ from him.

But for five,
I'll let you lick my titties.


No, those are... those are
reasonable prices, but you know, I...

But what, motherfucker?

What? You don't like titties?
No, I love titties.

Titties are the best, right?

I just... You know, I had a big breakfast.

I didn't really anticipate
licking titties today.

The fuck are you doing here, then?
Well, I'm here looking for somebody.

Manny?


Yeah, Manny.

Name's Manuel.

Only my friends call me Manny.

And you and me...

We ain't friends, are we?

No. No, we're not.

Oh, we ain't friends?

No! Yeah...
[door opening]

Wait a minute. Hold on. See, I just...

You know, I came here to ask you
about somebody

who's a mutual friend.

So that's gotta count for something,
right?

Here, let me just...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, guys.

Where the hell did he come from?

Come on, now.Â I'm just
grabbing my cell phone.

See, I just... Hold on, I'm gonna...

show you something.

I'mma pull this picture up.

Shit, not that picture.

Hang on. Give me one second. This is...

This is dumb.
I just I hate this new update.

This shit is stupid.

Um... Here. Okay, okay.

Did he come in here, maybe last week,
looking to...

you know, make a purchase

from you, did he?

He didn't do that, no.
No, that doesn'tÂ make sense at all.

Look, I'mma... I'mma just get out of here,
you know. This is absolutely...


Look, I'm just happy that you're okay,

and that this didn't
turn into a shootout or something.

It's kinda hard for itÂ to escalate
into a shootoutÂ when you don't have a gun.

That's funny.

No. Like, I'm not a gun guy.

Not a gun guy?

JJ, you're in the FBI.

Even I have a gun.
And I live in the nice part of Brooklyn.

Do you know that most gunshot wounds
are self-inflicted?

Statistically speaking,
you're saferÂ without one.

Not when you're in a drug house
investigating a murder.

Did you at least find anything?

Yeah, but it's nothing good.

[woman's voice over PA]

All right.

So, I hacked into the medicalÂ examiner's
database and I pulledÂ the initial

toxicology report.

The cops might have been right.



There's no way that Karim
could've done this to himself.

The concentration levels are too high.

He would've OD'd
before he evenÂ finished using.

Who would do this to him?

Where are you going?

I gotta get Manny to talk.

Karim's body was found outside his place.
He has to know something.

You are not going back there.
Not without the police.

Manny is not talking to the police.

Okay.

So, if he won't talk to theÂ police
and he won't talk to you,

then who is he gonna talk to?

[uplifting guitar music playing]


Hello!

Oh!

Um...

Hi... Um...


I'm looking for...

for...
Shaft?

Mm-hm.

Is he here?

Who's asking?

Oh, shit!

Um... I...

It's me. It's JJ.


JJ! John Shaft, Junior.

Your son!
[Shaft] My son?

Son? I thought you pulled out
on time,Â every time. Shit.

Junior?
Yeah.

Fuck you doing here?


Come on.

What the fuck are you wearing?



some kind of stripper name or some shit.

and...

that shit's for real.

[woman scoffs]
I'll call you.


Yeah...

I will.

Hell of a Pilates teacher.


I'm good.

I can fix you a bubbly water
with aÂ wedge of lime,

if you like.

It's eleven o'clock in the morning.

Like you aren't shaming me
by suggesting that me drinking water

would actually be a bad thing.

And as for that wedge of lime,
it makes it an alkaline, so...


Oh, my God. Your mom
has really fucked you up.

No, she just raised me.

She didn't abandon me 25 years ago.

Whoa, whoa, pump your brakes now.

I did not abandon you.

It's a little more complicated than that.

Oh, okay.Â Well, I didn't realize
that it was complicated.

You know, in that case, all is forgiven.

You're standing here acting
like I ain't remember you.

Like I ain't send you shit
every birthday...

Like the condoms you sent me
when I was 10?

Remember that year I sent you
those VIP passesÂ to Honeybuns

with the complimentary $500 stacks?

No.

Ah! Your mama didn't give you that, huh?

She's scared you're gonna

run into your grandma up in there.

You know, she had
more stripper girlfriends

than an Arab got hoes in the harem.

Could you not talk about
my grandmotherÂ like that, please?

Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

So my blood

is collecting checks from theÂ FBI?

That's right.

Hm.

How's it feel, you working for the Man?

You mean having an actual job?

Like... paying taxes?

Not living off the grid
in an all-cash sublet? It's great.

So...

you in the city now?

Oh, no, don't tell me.

Uh... down in Soho, exposed brick loft,

with a bi-curiousÂ roommate,
with a little furry-ass dog.

And...

Oh! A farmhouse sink.

You've been stalking my Facebook?

I look like I'm on Facebook, motherfucker?

You come in here
with your skinny-ass jeans,

your button-down plaid Gap shirt,

and what looks like some
badminton fucking Nikes.

[Shaft laughs]

Any nigga with two eyes and a dick
could read you a mile away.

Oh, your mom did one hell of a job
turning you into a bona fide white boy.

Oh, what? 'Cause I shop at the Gap
and I haveÂ a college degree

and I know my FICO score,
that means I'm not black?

Well, it kind of does.
You know what?

I'm not doing this withÂ you.

I didn't come here to argue
about myÂ clothes,

or where I work,
or any of the father-son stuff

that you wanna talk about.
I'm here for business.

What kind ofÂ business
could your Don Lemon ass

have in my world?


I need your help.


I knew it!

I knew this day would come.

No matter how hard your mom
tried to kill that family shit in you,

those Shaft swimmers found their way
all the way up inÂ that pussy, didn't they?

Come on. How far along is she?
How much you need?

No, there's no she.

I need to hire you.

I need your help for a case.

Oh.

You can't afford me.

You owe me.

Just consider it payback
for fatherÂ figure deprivation.

Nigga, what?

Please don't use the N-word.

Okay.

What's the case?

I think my best friend was murdered.
You think?

It was ruled as an overdose,
but I have reason to believe...

Whoa. Stop right there.

I've heard all this before.

You've heard all of what before?

Friends and family of the junkies,

always looking for some other reason,

when a junkie is just a junkie.
Case closed.

You didn't know him. He was clean.

[Shaft clears throat]

That overdose was bogus.

He had enough heroin in his system
to kill 10 people.

There's no way he could've
done something like that to himself.

I traced the supplier to this run-down
tenement in Harlem on 139th Street.

On 139th Street?

You sure?

Yeah.



Well, that's interesting.



Who did that to you, son?

Don't act like you care about that.

No, no, no, no. You tell me

who put hands on you
like you're some little punk.

And you tell me right now.

All right, it's this... this henchman.

This guy named Manuel.

What?

One of Manny's push-up-doing punks
did that to you?

Yep.

That motherfucker must have lost
his goddamn mind.

Shit.

Um... What are you doing?

We gotta go handle our business. Come on.

[indistinct chatter]

What? You're just gonna march
right in there?

You said youÂ wanted my help.

Yeah, help finding out
who killed my best friend,

not help getting my ass kicked again.

Well, this is the streets, son.
What do you expect me to do?

I don't know.
I thought maybe you had his cell.

You could send a tersely worded text.

Oh, no, no, no. See, I'm anti-gun.

There's a reason I'm an analyst
and not anÂ agent.

That some of your mama's shit?
No, it's some of your shit,

that turned into my mama's shit,
that turned into myÂ shit.

I think.

That's some more of your mama's shit.
You think too much.

You know what?
I think I'm gonna wait in the car.

That's what your mom would do.

["Theme from Shaft" playing]

Unbelievable.

Some of my mama's shit.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

[JJ shouts] Fine!

What'd I tell you about that last time?

[man 2] Shit! My arm!

My man.

I'm supposed to be meeting
my real estate agent here.

But you know,

I could have sworn this place
had a lot more light.

What? Look, man,
I don't know what the fuck you...


[man 3 groans]


Oh, my God! I thought you
was really gonna shoot him.

Get their guns.
Okay. Yeah.

I got it. I'mma be taking these.

Now, which one of these motherfuckers
lay his hands on you?

Um... That one.
[Shaft] Him? Oh.

[gunshot]

Oh, shit, no. I pointed at the other one!
Yeah, I know,

but since you're gonna be
whooping his ass, I wanted to make sure

he didn't jump in.
You are gonna whoop his ass, right?

Um...

[man 3 grunting] Oh, no!

How's he supposed to answer you?
You're crushing his nuts.

No. When I get leverage on the wall

Yo, what the fuck is going...

over-the-counter erectile cream.

Uh... I want Jodeci and Al Green

to drop aÂ Christmas album.

I want 24 hours uninterrupted
with HalleÂ Berry,

hence the erectile cream.

But what I reallyÂ want to know,

is why you...

didn't afford my son...

the respect associated
with the Shaft

family name.

That's your son?

Pride and joy.


He's running?

Yeah.
Shoot him.

Where are the guns you picked up?
Oh... Um... I threw those out the window.

You don't throw guns out an open window!

Kids live up here!
Oh!



Damn!

Move!
[Man] Hey!

[brakes skiding]

[Manny groans]

[Manny groaning]


Gentrification's a bitch, ain't it?

Here, cover.

Uh...
Take the gun!

[JJ groaning]

[Manny groans in pain]

What the fuck! [groans]

[loud groan]

Oh! Damn!

Yo, your pinkie just got fucked up.

Show him the goddamn picture,Â will you?

Oh... Ah...

So, my friend's body

was found outside your building lastÂ week.
So, what?

Was he buying drugs from you?

Can't hear you!
No, no, no, look, look, look.

I don't knowÂ what he was doing there.
He used to cop from me,

but I ain't seen him in a while,
ever since he was fucking

with that
Brothers Watching Brothers bullshit.

Brothers Watching Brothers?

Damn, son. Sounds like your boy
might've been on the down low.

Anything you wanna tell me?

What?

No.
You sure?

'Cause that damn sure would explain
a whole lot of shit.

Yes, I'm sure.

So you like pussy?

Yes, I like... I like pussy. Yeah.

The way you say "pussy,"
it don't sound like you like it.

Describe what a pussy look like.

It's got this little...
No, you know what... Fuck. Listen, man.

Brothers Watching Brothers
is a rehab center for Army vets.

For real?
Yes!

For real?
For real?

Yes!

That all?
Look, that's all I know. All right?

All right, then.

For real, though?

Them motherfuckers need a new name.
See, Manny, that wasn't hard, was it?

You broke my whole fucking hand!

I broke two fucking fingers!

[Shaft] This...
[scrams]

Is me breaking your whole fucking hand.

I hate it when motherfuckers exaggerate.


Oh, and you fucked up my coat.
That's gonna be $100Â to get it cleaned.

God.

Hundred dollars.
[Manny] Oh...

[Manny groaning]

Wow.
All right, then.

That's...
We're good.

Get in the fucking car.
Holy...

I think what you're trying to say

is "thank you".

[JJ chuckles] Yeah.

Right. Thanks.

Could you drop me off, please?

I think coming to you was a mistake.

I'll take it from here.
Take what from here?

I'm going to Brothers Watching Brothers.
See what I can find out.

Fuck that! <i>We</i> are going
to Brothers Watching Brothers.

We?
[Shaft] Yeah, we.

If you're gonna pursue this investigation,
I'mma have to babysit your ass.


No, that would be mine.

But I can't have your ass out here

[music stops abruptly]

Hello.

Welcome to Brothers Watching Brothers.

How can I help you?

Stop. Yes. Hi.

We were actually just hoping to talk...
[Shaft on mic] Yo!

Could whoever's in charge
of this motherfucker come up front?

Why do you... Really?

Can I help y'all?

Sorry about that. I'm JJ.

This is...
Shaft. John Shaft.

Ignore him.

He thinks he's the black James Bond.

If that motherfucker was real,
he'd think he was me.


I'm Major Gary Cutworth. We likeÂ to keep
it a little casualÂ around here.


What can I do for you fellas?

I was hoping to talk to you
about a friend of mine, Karim?

Yeah.

I remember seeing you at the funeral.
Everything okay up here?


meet Sergeant Keith Williams,
Staff SergeantÂ Eddie Dominguez.

These fellas are friends of Karim's.
They want to talk.

Why don't y'all come back?

We'll have some coffee.
Yeah, decaf for me.

[Cutty] What's that?
[JJ] I'd love a decaf.

We opened this facility two years ago,

and we conduct therapy,
both physical andÂ mental,

not to mention a majority of our staff
that work here are retired vets.

to the workforce.

back donated vehicles damaged
from overseas missions,

and we refurbish them here,

sell them, help make profits
for our rehab operations.

It's crazy for us to go through those
three tours together

and to just lose Karim like that.

Yeah, it's tough. It's real tough.

Hell, why didn't he just come to us?

Maybe he was scared to.

Scared? You ever been to war?

Frontlines, Harlem, '80's.
That work for you?

What Dom's trying to say is that

the war really took its toll
on aÂ lot of men.

The drinking, drugs, and...

Karim was just... He was worst of all.

He just couldn't cope.

Yeah, and with the lack of funding
and the red tape,

the VA couldn't even begin
to start helping.

That's why we started this place.

Brothers Watching Brothers.

Built for soldiers, by soldiers.

See, now that's a better name.

And no surprise,
this place was Karim's idea.

That's why it was so strange
when he started pulling away.

Pull out? What?
Away. He said, "pulling away."

Yeah, ever since he... found religion,

he basically stopped comingÂ around.

Karim? Religious?


Well, he started going to a mosque uptown
after he met his girl, Anam.

The Rashad Mosque.

Yeah, I think that's right.
Once they got together,

that's where he spent all his time.

he fell back intoÂ using.

Shit, man. You know what? I don't think
I wanna talk about this anymore.

What exactly are y'all looking to find?

Uh, we were just trying to get some...
Closure.

Just trying to get some closure here,
that's all.

Yeah. Thanks, fellas.

Yeah. Of course.

Appreciate it.
Of course.


I appreciate it.

[police siren wailing]

The hell is the matter with you?

Something ain't right
about that DominguezÂ motherfucker

not making eye contact and shit.

Maybe 'cause he's upset
he just lost his friend.

I'm more concerned
about that Anam girlÂ in the mosque.

You know, the FBI monitors thatÂ place

for terrorist activity.
So you think your boy

might've been aÂ terrorist?
What? Of course not! No.

Sounds like you're saying
your friend was a terrorist.

That's pretty fucked up, if you ask me.

Are you insane?

Karim was my best friend. I'm just saying
that thereÂ has to be aÂ reason

he didn't tell me
about that part of his life.

Yeah! 'Cause that motherfucker
was a fucking terrorist!

Jesus.
No, Allah.

We are. We're here to clear our heads,

That's the key to solving any case.

Hey, Shaft! Looking good.

Yeah, when are you gonna let us
give you the two-for-one special? Mm?

Who's your friend?

Oh, ladies.
This is my son, Junior.

Oh, my God, you have a son?
Look, I always get y'all mixed up.

Baby.
And Sugar.

Sugar!
[Sugar] Come here.

Oh, okay. Come on, now.
Wait, those can't be your real names.

I bet there is nothing junior
about this Shaft.


Well, too bad you're not gonna
have the chance to find out,

'cause he was just about to leave.

a couple more drinks with us.

Um...
[Sugar chuckles]


Maybe one... one more drink.
Okay, it's lit!

[Sugar laughs] Go! I said move.


Andre, we got a new friend.

You've been out of that boy's life
20-some-odd years.

Now all of a sudden
you wanna play daddy?

That's fucked up, you know that?
Play daddy?

Don't bullshit me, Shaft. You hear me?

You think you could tear up half of Harlem
chasing down Manny with your kid

and me not hearing about it?

Don't nothing happening in these streets
without me knowing.

Yeah, and that's why I'm here.

Junior's got a lead,Â and I think
it's gonna take me straight to Gordito.

Now, that rat motherfucker is about
to stick his head up out his hole,

and I'm gonna whack-a-mole
the shit out of him.

I need you to get some info
on this dudeÂ for me.

Name, Eddie Dominguez. Army vet.

Brothers Watching Brothers.

That's a terrible motherfucking name.

Yeah, they need to change that shit.

I'll see what I can do.

So, you're saying that
with an associate's degree,

I can then apply for night classes?

Mm-hmm.

And get my bachelor's?
Absolutely, yes.

And she ain't gonna know shit, all right?
Okay.

It's... [sighs]

Gordito's slimy ass has been
slipping throughÂ my fingers

since before this kid was born.

This shit is personal.

Now, if Junior is my ticket
to finally nailing his ass... [scoffs]

Well, that's motherfucking
street poetic justice.

You feel me?

Besides, I'm looking out for the boy.

I've put him in the Baby-Sugar sandwich.

Yeah. That's some good
looking out right there.

No, we're just friends. [sighs]

"No.

It could be dangerous.

Just no... There's no ass tapping.

Ah! But you wanna be

[JJ groans]

[Shaft chuckles] Yeah.

We all got that one special girl.

a coconut water,Â please?

Yeah, coconut water, coming up.

I could use the electrolytes.

Oh! [chuckles]

Oh!

She wasn't. But, you know,

that I've been working with.

John Shaft.


Wow.

I'm sorry, I just...

I wouldn't know what you look like
because, you know,

you haven't shown up
for the last 25 years.

Oh, beautiful and fiery.

What is he doing here, JJ?

He's helping.

Really?

I doubt it.

Okay. [laughs]

Now that we're all acquainted...

I thought it was a good question.
Yeah. I'm sure.

[JJ] Yeah...
You okay?

I'm just...

I'm not feeling, um...

Ah, damn, I kicked it too hard last night.
I'm fucked up.

No.

like a terroristÂ training ground.

I still don't know.

Is that the girl from the funeral?

That hasÂ to be Anam.
Yeah.

[Sasha speaking Arabic]
[woman speaking Arabic]

May I help you?

We'd like to talk to Anam.

We didn't get a chance to meet,
but we're childhood friends with Karim

and we'd really like
to ask youÂ some questions.

I met Karim not long afterÂ he returned
from the war.

We didn't start dating
until early lastÂ year.

That's when he got clean.

Everything was so perfect.

Did Karim have any enemies?

Somebody want to do him harm?

No.

He had so much to live for.

He was building our new youth center.

Oh!


Any way we can look inside?
[Farik] No!

You may not.
This is highly inappropriate.

[Farik] You cannot speak to my daughter.
Please excuse my father.

You're father's Imam?

Yes.

Sir... Please excuse us.

No. You must leave now.

So...

are you a Muslim from a Muslim country...

or did you find Allah in some cell block?

What did you say to me?

Can we just calm down
for one second,Â please?


Yes. Yes. <i>Zakat.</i> How about a...

a donation, as a sign of good faith?

Hey, you got change for a 10?

What is that? FBI?

You are FBI.

What? Where'd you get
that crazy idea from?

Do I look like I'm in the FBI?

Out! Out at once!

Jeez.

You know, I'm trying to give homeboy
the benefit of the doubt,

but that motherfucker is annoying.

I need to find out how muchÂ <i>zakat</i>
it's gonna take to build one of those.

Oh, I'm thinking a shitload for sure.

Only problem is,Â my laptop's
registered to the Bureau.

I need to get to a computer
they can't trace.

I got a computer you can use,
in my office.

Whoa!

Where'd you get a computer?

I won it in a game show called

"Beat the Shit OutÂ of a Piece-of-Shit
Drug DealerÂ and You Get to Keep his Shit."

Cute.

So, I have a shift to catch
at the hospital.

I'm gonna talk to you later, okay?
Okay. I'll call you.

Okay.
Or, you know what, I can text you.

Because we've got text history

for days, so I can...

Yeah. Get the thumbs working on that.

Why the hell can't you young people
just talk to each other?

Fuck a text.

It's a phone. Call her.

Or better yet,Â why don't you just
take her to dinner,

and debrief her over the meal?


That actually sounds really nice.

It does.

Yeah. Yeah!

I'll call you about dinner.
Awesome.

I'll talk to you later.
Okay.

Bye.


All right, thanks.

You got to stop being
so afraid of women, son.

You know, women...

want a man to be a man.

They don't want some pussy.

Well, some women want some pussy.

And some women want both.

That's my preference. But...

in general, women want a man to be manly.

[car door opens]


[car door closes]

I'm pretty sure women don't like
being told what it is that they like.

See, that's the shit I'm talking about.

Men used to be men.

Now, you millennial motherfuckers
are running around

worrying about what women think,
and how they feel,

and apologizing and shit.
It's embarrassing.


Yes. Men don't apologize.

That's a trap they set for us.

Real men just own their shit.

No. Real men take responsibility
for whatÂ they do.

Real men are strong enough to admit
when they're wrong.

Real men are strong enough
to putÂ their foot

in a motherfucker's ass
when they get pissed off.

What is that? The Shaft family motto?

It's an unwritten rule, Stephen A.

Shit. [grunts]

Who that?
It's Ma.

Do not tell her you're with me.

Nine or ten maybe.


Cool.

[tires squealing]

Wait a minute.
If you don't use aÂ computer,

how do you keep track
of all your case files?

I got a system.

[JJ scoffs]

Unbelievable.

You have unlimitedÂ information
available to you in seconds,

the tools to store
and to organize all your files.

Graphics, music, HD porn,
and that's just...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, HD porn?

Can you hook that up to the TV?

Music, too.

[JJ typing]

Whoa.

All the mosque filesÂ are encrypted.

Like... crazy encrypted.

Shouldn't they be?

some real shady shit.

to stayÂ away from?

You placed a highlyÂ classified

you're on administrative leave.

What?

For how long?

Who the fuck are you?

Who the fuck am I?

<i>Puta cucaracha...</i>

Oh! I'm sorry.

He doesn't knowÂ how to properly
speak to women.

We're just here...

looking for the owner, Bennie.

I'm Bennie.

And again...

who the fuck are you?

Oh, could you give us one moment, please?

Yo, what is wrong with you?

She picked up a bat.

So what're you gonna do?
You're gonna break her fingers, too?

You can't beat up a woman.

Why not?
Because she's a woman!

That's like... misogynistic.

You're the one being misogynistic.
I ain't mention no gender.

You the oneÂ bringing up
her being a woman and shit.

I don't give a fuck about her gender.
Okay.

I'm an equalÂ opportunity ass-whooper.

Okay, just... Can I handle this?

Thank you.

Hi, Bennie.<i> </i>[chuckles]

We don't want any trouble. You know,

we just came to ask you
just aÂ couple of questions.

[JJ] Oh!
Damn!

[JJ groaning]

I was just trying to talk. [moans]

Now, my son says I can't put hands on you

'cause you're a woman.

Now, since I can't whoop your ass,

I'm gonna have to beat the shit...

out of your shit.

[JJ groaning]

What the fuck?

Oh, there's no non-violent people
in Harlem?

Junior.

Oh, damn, she's strong.

I think she's ready to talk.

Oh, it's bleeding.


You know this guy?

<i>Se parece a un come mierda...</i>

English, please.

The boy speaks Mexican, notÂ Puerto Rican.

No.

What about a guy named Farik?

Oh, oh! So you do know Farik.

Well, let's talk about
that 500k you sent

Farik and his friends at the mosque.

Hey. You better find
a whole new answer or something,

because he's running out
of things to shoot.

The mosque is a staple of the community.

Supermercado is proud
to support all groups.

Really?
Really.

Hey, you remind me...

Bennie.

Have you and me...

ever done the... horizontal boogie?

No, <i>papi.</i>

I'd remember fucking a blackÂ guy
dressed like Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>


<i>CoÃ±o!</i> That shit was ostrich!

I don't give a fuck.

What was that for?

I'm sick of these Laurence Fishburne
comparisons. It's just getting old.

Oh.

You know what? [sighs]

We're gonna leave you alone.

Yippee.

<i>Hasta la vista...</i> Bennie.

I meant to say that shit
like Schwarzenegger.



<i>I know I've seen</i>

Bennie somewhere before.

I ain't sure she wasn't lying
about meÂ tapping that ass.

You've gotta be kidding me, man.

You're never gonna find anything
on her in this mess.

Ta-da!

No way.

How'd you just do that?

I told you, I got a system.

This is my "Puerto Ricans
I don't trust" file.

You literally have
a racist-based catalog system?

Ain't that how the FBI does it?

Yeah, pretty much.

God-motherfucking-damn!

Got her!

Oh, shit. That's Bennie!


Who's this dude that she's with?

That is Pierro "Gordito" Carrera.

He's been the head of Las Caras boys,

you know, the baddest gang up in Harlem,

since like forever.

Those motherfukers

were the ones responsible for bringing
crack intoÂ the hood in the '80's.

Now, they're the reason
45's talking about

[hoarse voice] "an opioid epidemic."

But what I can't figure out,
is what business

a motherfuckerÂ like this
has got with a mosque.

Maybe Supermercado Fantastico
is just a front

for the Las Caras' drug money.

You know, they could be using

the cleric's mission trips

over to Afghanistan to bring in heroin.

Karim probably found out about it,
and they killed him

because he was gonna
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

That's very, very possible.

Damn. I can't wait to push this
in Vietti's stupid face.

No, no, no, no.

We're gonna solve this shit ourselves.

Then, I tell you the Shaft way

to tell that dick head boss of yours
to kiss yourÂ ass.

No, that's... that's what I meant.
But first, we gotta put eyes on Bennie.

So we can get some proof.

So, I'mma go out, get some coffee,

a bunch of Papaya dogs, and we gonna do
an old-fashioned stakeout.

How about we don't do anything

that starts with "old-fashioned"?


planted a micro-cam on Bennie's desk.

Hm.

So, you know, we can watch the footage
back tomorrow morning.

Take the night off, Big Dog.

I'mma go get dressed
for dinner with Sasha.

Hanging out with Mom after.

Why the fuck would you be
hanging out with your mom after,

when youÂ should be knee-deep in pussy?

Knee-deep?

I don't even know what direction the...

You know what?Â Nevermind. You're right.

I don't know where in the world
I would be withoutÂ your fatherly wisdom.



Go tear that ass up, son.

Oh, you wanna use my car?

No, I don't have no driver's license.

Me, neither.

And, son, remember.

It's your duty... to please that booty.


Give her the Shaft, Big Boy.

This is crazy.

You're telling me that the cleric
and this gang are working together?

Yeah, it was hard for me
to believe that at first, too.

Even if any of this is true,
why would Karim

have anything to do with it?
[JJ] I don't know,

but I'mma find out.

And when I do,
whoever killed him is gonna be sorry.

Starting to sound a lot like your dad.

What?

Are you serious?

Hm-hm.

You motherfucking think I sound
like thatÂ goddamn motherfucker?


He's actually really funny, though.

And you should see the way the people
in Harlem react to him. He's like...

a legend. [chuckles]

Well, I mean, I'm happy your dad's funny,

but it doesn't make up for the fact

that he abandoned you when you were a baby
and wantedÂ nothing to do with you.

All right. Look.


screwed up.

Borderline insane.

But, deepÂ down, I feel like
he's actually an okay dude.

Don't get me wrong.

There's no way that I'm just gonnaÂ forget
that he abandoned me as a kid.

Okay.

[indistinct chatter]

Hi.


Would you like me to take your coat?
Oh, sure. Thank you.

Ooh, lookie here.

you don't look so bad yourself.

Well, you know, I do what I do.

You're a Super Bowl hero.

Not ID, porno star.

[women laugh]
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

You know him?

Unfortunately.

Who is he exactly?

Just somebodyÂ who destroys everything
he touchesÂ and never seems to go away.

Oh, he's a contractor.


I just...

I just need to go to the bathroom.

Okeydokey.


I'm sorry?

Okeydokey.

That is what you said.

I'll be waiting.

[Maya] Bad seeing you.

That's Junior's mama. She a little bitter.

Don't worry about her, though.
Come on, now.

How did this motherfucker
know where I was?

Is this motherfucker following me?


He's trying to get me back.

Motherfucker, I don't want you back!
And I'm happy. I'm so happy.

I gonna be the happiest bitch.

The girls weren't even cute.

Did they look sad to you?
They looked sad to me.

I like a nigga with no swag.

I'm about the swagless

Why do you think
that shit turns me on?

Them hard ass nipples.
[gasps]

[Shafts chuckles]
This is not a joke, John.

This is why JJ and I had to leave
your ass in the first place, remember?

Oh, shit. Junior.

Junior? What do you mean "Junior"?

Please tell me

that you did not get him
involved in your bullshit.

Do you drive?
No.

Excuse me, Maya.Â I don't think...
Did you drive?

[sighs]
Awesome. Come on.

Excuse me, but it's my car.


It is a lease.
Could you be a little more careful?

I don't know what the fuck is going on,
but if you don't get our son out of this

shit that you got him into...
Maya, I didn't get him into...

You're his father!Â He's your son!

And not that I expect you to understand
what that means, but there is

one fucking rule. You keep him safe.
I'm trying.

No, John Shaft.

You're failing. Again!

[adventure music playing]

I still can't believe
that you're in the FBI.

What?

You used to get your ass kicked
when we were kids.

What was that guy's name?

Mike Mitchell.
[Sasha chuckles] Yes.

He would steal your pudding cup
at lunch every day.

Until Karim dropped his ass

in front of the whole school.

Remember that?
[Sasha] Mm.

[chuckles]
[JJ] He had to give me a pudding cup

every day after that. [chuckles]
[Sasha] Mm-hm.

Ooh! [chuckles]

Good job, son.


Yeah, regular chip off the same

Don't do that anymore.

Ow. You're worse than the shooters.
Dad, check this out.

I got this off of one of the shooters,

and I tracedÂ the hit
straight back to Bennie.

Boom!
That's not all.

Look, this is thing full of messages
about a huge drop.

You can get all this from the carrier.
Nothing's ever really erased.

Until you delete it.
No. That's what I'm saying.

anything ever.

Yeah, they're still on the server.

Yeah.
Oh, shit.

No. No. No.
No, it's okay. This is mine. JJ used it.

Oh, it's pretty. I like the purple... Oh.
And he's gonna buy me bullets.

Wait a minute. Look at this.

Another shipment from Afghanistan.

Say anything about Gordito being there?

Um... No.

But between thisÂ and the bank statements,
that's more than enough

evidence to tie the Las Caras gang

to the cleric,Â right?

So what's next?

We go back up
to the Supermercado Fantastico

and bust some heads open?

You know, now...

just might be the right time
to turn the case over to the FBI.

You did!

Yep.

You've beenÂ using me...

When I first came to you about Karim,

the first thing that crossed your mind
wasn't that it could lead to Gordito?

Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.


You can abandon me again and go ahead
and follow him now, right?

What am I supposed to do?

Hm? Dominguez is a trained soldier,
who's apparently not afraid to kill.

And Gordito is the most dangerous
motherfucker in the city.

I put you through enough, son.

I'm just trying to keep you safe.

So now for the first time in my life,

He came to you?

Yeah.


Wow...

I spent all these years trying

[inhales sharply] Well...

If JJ's going to put himself in danger,

you'll be there to protect him.

Yeah. I will.

Yeah, I know.

So?

You had fuck it up, didn't you?

[Maya scoffs]

[door closes]


Yeah, she's thinking about it.

We were wrong.

The cleric wasn't the supplier
for Las Caras.Â Dominguez was.

Bennie is Dominguez's cousin.

So Bennie is the one who put out
the hit on us at the restaurant.

Right. I mean, think about it.
It makes a perfect sense.

Dominguez goes overseas
with the other Brothers

to visit troops.

back toÂ the States, filled with drugs.

All right, I need to get closer.
Just wait here.

What the hell? No.
No. Trust me.

It's not that I don't think
that you canÂ do it. It's just...

I need you.

Watch my back.

Please?

Just text me if Dominguez moves.

Okay.

Go! Come on, let's go.
Oh, yeah.


[Dominguez] I told you not to kill Karim.
Relax.

What's your big plan now?
'Cause you always got one.

[Cutty] Enough.
[Dominguez] What is it?

Seriously. 'Cause now they're
getting close, Bennie got popped,

and now they know it wasn't the cleric.

It's only a matter of time
before they end up here.

You're being paranoid.
Oh, now it's me.

We just need toÂ continue as planned.


No. Fuck that, man.

Smuggling drugs was supposed to be
temporary, okay?

This is all your fault.

You got us into it. Now, get us out.

No. That's some
simple bitch shit. Okay.

We ain't gonna be her.

It's funny 'cause you never seem to mind

after I cut you in.

Keith, this getting out of hand.

We need to turn ourselves in right now.

You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like Karim.

And look where that gotÂ him.

It's gonna break Bennie's heartÂ when I
tell her that her cousin was aÂ snitch.

What the hell's that supposed
to mean, Cutty? [grunts]

It means...

I'm not gonna let loose ends
mess thisÂ up.

That's what it means.

I mean did you think
that we should turn ourselves in?

Huh? Did you?


Fuck! My phone!

Shit!


It's that Shaft kid.
He saw everything.

Get him!



Come on!

Fuck!

That motherfucker's got to die.

We need to go find Sasha.

Can't the FBI handle that?

You just don't think that I can do this.

Look, I know the only person
that you giveÂ a fuck about is Gordito.

But I can'tÂ lose her.

And I can't lose you.

Do you wanna know why
I want Gordito so badly?

That motherfucker's the reasonÂ our family
got tornÂ apart in the first place.

Now, he came for me,

your mom was in the car.
So were you.

You were just a baby.

I can't let that shit go.

But you know what?

Fuck Gordito if it means
I lose my sonÂ again.

I didn't come here looking
for that motherfucker.

I came here looking for you.

Thanks.

I'm glad you came.

I'm actually a little impressed
that you found me.

I keep telling you I know way more
about this city than that GPS shit.

You know what? I think I can
track Sasha's phone.

I just gotta get to a computer.

I got you. Officer Thomas!


What is it, Shaft?

You got something you wanna tell me
about this little shitstorm

that blewÂ through here?
[Shaft mumbles]

No.

But my son needs to book a flight.

You mind if he uses your computer?

Book a flight.

Mm-hm.


Gordito was selling them.

And Bennie wasÂ laundering the money.

I'm sorry. Do y'all

want some mints?

Y'all need some music...

No, thank you. We're good.

All right, if you need something,
you just let me know.

I got it all right here for you, okay?
Okay.

So, I figure

Dominguez was using Cutty as a pawn,

to get in the gang
with Bennie and Gordito.

Did you say "Gordito"?

Ain't that like a big burrito
or something?

Say what?


When the other Brothers found out,

then Cutty tried to just cut him in,

but Karim wouldn't go for it.


why come y'all think it is thatÂ Jabbar
don't get the credit he deserves?

He scored more points than Jordan,

LeBron...
Babycakes.

Mm?
In case you ain't noticed,

we're trying to work some shit out
back here, all right?

You just having a conversation
out loud, so I thought I could be in it.


Now, that still don't explain the mosque.

Well, maybe when Karim
didn't take the money,

they tried to just make him happy
by having Bennie forward his amount

to the cleric.

Right. That way, the clericÂ wouldn't know
the money was dirty.

Yeah, but I don't think

that KarimÂ could live
with knowing the truth,

and Cutty couldn't have any loose ends,

so their only option...

Kill Karim.
Kill Karim.

[woman gasps]

Y'all want to kill Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
[JJ] No!

But I'm about to kill you,
if you don't mind your damn business

and drive this fucking car.


If we gonna take on Las Caras,

we're gonnaÂ need a lot more firepower.

I know just the motherfucker
to hook us up.

Look here, sweetheart. I need to
change the address we're going to.

Oh, you talking to me now?

I don't actually need to know.
You just need to put it into the app.

Put it in the what?

Yeah, I'll take care of it.

How come I couldn't just tell her
where we're going?

No doorbell?


Just bang on the door on your left.
[JJ] Okay.

on second thought, fuck it.

This motherfucker never locks his door.

Yo, where you at?

<i>But I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a drunk.</i>

<i>Alcoholic gotta go</i>
<i>to them goddamn meetings.</i>


Pop.

Pop?

It's me.

Son?

Wait. Grandad?

No, it can't be.

Damn. You look like shit.


How could you look 20 years older
than my gray ass?

Yeah, it's good to see your ass, too.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wow.

You're my grandson?

I haven't been able to see you
since your daddy

drove your light-skinned ass
way the hell upstate.

Only you could be
a worse father than IÂ was.

You were a wonderful father.
Hm-hm.

After you stopped pretending
to be my uncle.

Wait, what?

Don't pay attention to him.

Come over here
and give your granddaddy some love.

[John and JJ laughs]

Y'all hungry?

Want some grits?
Yeah.

Grits? What's that?

It's a long story.

Look, I need to ask you a favor.
What you need?

You still packing?


Boy, back in the day, we didn't need guns.

was our bare knuckles.

Oof. Old school.

Okay. [chuckles]
[John chuckles]

But you can't be too prepared.

Oh, yeah.

What the hell?

Damn!

Grandpa!

Yo, what don't you have?

So, what's the gig?

Oh, drug kingpin, military scandal,

bad guys holding Junior'sÂ girlÂ hostage.
You know, the usual.

Usual shit. Yeah.

<i>You remember when your parents</i>
<i>used to help you with your homework?</i>

<i>You'd go to school the next day,</i>
<i>and it'd all be wrong. Remember that shit?</i>


Thanks, Pops.Â I'm gonna get
this shit back to you.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

You think I'm just gonna give youÂ my shit
and let you have all the funÂ without me?

Hell, no. I'm coming with you.

You sure?

Damn right, I'm sure.
I'm bored as hell up in here.

All right.

Let's go get your girl.

Yeah. Let's get Gordito's ass.

[menacing music plays]

I don't know, man. I do not like her
just sitting thereÂ without restraints on.

Where the fuck's she gonna go, Cutty?

[grunts]
[Cutty grunts]

Hey! [groans]

[menacing music continues]


You should take better care of our guest.

[action music playing]

[man humming, gasps]

Can I help you gentlemen?
[John] Yeah.

I was tellingÂ my boys here,
that even at my age...

I could take you.

Come on, Pop. Ain't you got
something better to do?

Sound like to me
he's calling you out, homes.

That is... unless you're scared.

Scared? [mutters]

[man] Okay.
Come on.

Okay.

Take your vitamins? [chuckles]

Are you trying or what?

[breathing heavily]

Hey, where you going?

Huh?
[John grunts]

[body thudding]

Still got it.

I bet if we were wrestling
for some FrenchÂ fries,

he might have won.

Not regular fries.Â For some chili
cheese fries, he'dÂ kick your ass.


That penthouse is using
the exact same feed

for the lobby and the elevator.

I'mma just go ahead and create a loop,
and I can use my phone.

A loop. Is that where they don't see us
when we're on the elevator?

Exactly. See, you're learning.
That shit don't never work in the movies.


Is that motherfucker snoring?


[elevator beeps]

What's up?

Hmm. Quality is perfect.

As always, it has been a pleasure

doing business with you.

Transfer the funds.


So they can't see us?
[JJ] Oh, 100%.

The only thing that they're gonna see
is the feed I uploaded. We're invisible.

Boy's got skills.


[cell phone beeps]

[static crackles]

Uh-oh.

Does that "uh-oh" mean
the movie shit is happening?

Well, you know, without Wi-Fi, the...
Do weÂ have Wi-Fi?

No.

So they can see us.

I mean, there's still a chance
that this is working. Hang on. Let me...


Sir, you should see this.

Shaft?

[speaks in Spanish]

[speaks in Spanish]

Watch the girl!


[yelling, grunts]

What the fuck?



Don't you fucking move!

What are you doing?

Oh, damn!


Get in here!


Ow!


Oh, fuck!

Get in here, JJ! Come on!


Oh!

[man 2 grunts]

These motherfuckers ain't playing.

Gordito!

It's been so many years.


No calls,

no letters.

I've missed you!



[John grunts]

[John and man 3 grunting]

[John] Motherfucker!
[man 3 grunts]



Fuck!

[man 4 and JJ grunting]

[grumbles]
[Sasha grunts]



[JJ] You hit my girl?
[grunts]

[Cutty groaning]




[grunts]
[groans]


[gun clicks]

Fuck.


You're out as well.

Yep.
[John] Mm-hm.

I'll tell you what.

Why don't we go old school?


[panting]
Not bad. Not bad.

Oh, so you wanna go there?

Let me get mine.

Eh, you pussy.



For my car, motherfucker.


Damn. You back here having a knife fight?
Oh, hell no. I shot him.


[JJ grunting]

[JJ groans]


Hey.

Hey.

[JJ groaning]
Say hi to Karim for me.


[Cutty groaning]


Motherfucker!


Like I said...

boy's got skills.




Hey.
Hey.

Are you okay?

Yeah. You?
Yeah.

Are you bleeding?

No, it's his blood.

[JJ exhales]

Oh, my God.



You all right?
Yeah.

Son of a bitch threw me into the table.


The fuck you laughing at?
I'm laughing 'cause you all thought

you're gonna do all this shit
by yourselves.


[clicks tongue] Let's not do that.

Okay, you can point your gun at me.

I'm the one you want.

Is that what you think?


I'm the cop that broke up
your little ghetto crack cartel,

and sent your ass

swirling around the toilet for the last
20 years, like a piece of shit you are.

That was not because of you.

Yeah, it was.

Your assassination attempt
only succeeded in breaking up my family.

That hit wasn't about you.

I wanted to take away

the one thing youÂ valued
more than anything else.

Now you're truly
about to loseÂ everything.

How do you feel?

[gunshot]
[Shaft groans]


Oh!



[wind howling]

[horn honks]
[car alarms wails]

I feel fine.

Motherfucker.


Dad!
[body thudding]

[JJ] Oh, what do I do? What do I do?
[Sasha] Keep some pressure on it!

Don't die on me, Dad, please!


Oh, Pop. Hey.


Oh, don't be a pussy, son.

What's that you say? What?

You brought me some pussy?

Dang.

I can't believe you actually
took a bulletÂ for me.

Oh, man. Shit was happening so fast.
It's like...

No, and I tripped.

[chuckles]
[Shaft] It was an accident.

Is that how you remember it?

Maya!

[chuckles, grunts]

You did bring me some pussy.

Can you not refer to my mother
as pussy,Â please?

Are you really gonna ruin this moment?

Okay.

This motherfucker
had Junior dead to rights.

I promised you

I was gonna take careÂ of him.

So I...

Yeah.

Now you gonna break me off?

Moment ruined.

How're we feeling, Mr. Shaft?

Groovy.
Great.

I'm good.

Sasha, can you please

prescribe this manÂ something

for his inflated ego?

You did good.

I'm actually glad you were there.


I'll talk to you later.

Hey, Sash, hang on.

Uh, yeah.

[both chuckle]

Oh, kiss her!
Kiss her!



[Maya laughs]

That's my boy.

Our boy. I pushed
the littleÂ motherfucker out.

After I shot him in.

You always claiming shit.

Can I get one of those?

No, I don't know where your lips been.
