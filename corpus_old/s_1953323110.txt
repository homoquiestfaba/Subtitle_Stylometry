It's about to come, it's about
to come, it's about to come.

In your face, in your hair.

I can't believe you bid
$1200 for this.

I have a really good feeling
about this. Trust me.

d Yes, you sure
Bought this all d

d And now you're rollin'
In this heap d

d But you paid You paid d

d You paid for this dirty
Berber rug d

Which isn't actually so bad,
because I think

you can get these stains out
with a little club soda.

This is all worthless.

Keep looking.
We'll find something.

Bingo.

This is ridiculous, Michelle.
It's such a waste of time.

What's that?

"Found footage" that we found.

Wouldn't it be amazing
if it was one of those

celebrity sex tapes and
we could sell it for millions?

Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Put it in.

All right.

<i>Carlsbad Police,
what's your emergency?</i>

<i>Five.</i>

<i>Excuse me?</i>

<i>Five.</i>

<i>Five.</i>

<i>Five what, ma'am?</i>

<i>d Five dollar footlong d</i>

<i>Ma'am, what's your emergency?</i>

<i>I'm a man, douche bag.</i>

<i>My voice is altered because
I've got eight demons in me</i>

<i>all taking turns to speak.</i>

<i>- Anyway, I killed five people.
I'm sorry?</i>

<i>I served them six-inch tuna
subs that I wiped my ass with.</i>

<i>They all died
from toxoplasmosis.</i>

<i>Who?</i>

<i>The entire cast of The Artist,
including that dog Uggie.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Send the police, jerk-off.</i>

<i>And if you're hungry, I still
have half a sandwich left.</i>

<i>The Carlsbad community
was leveled by tragedy today</i>

<i>as three clergy members
were found dead.</i>

At 11:47 p.m. in the evening,

there was a call into our office
in a facsimile

saying that there may have been
or might be a murder situation.

<i>But we cannot confirm or deny
that the cast of the film,</i>

<i>The Artist, has been murdered
in the basement of this house.</i>

I, myself, am not a fan of
the film. Didn't really get it.

Hi, my name is Dana Rosti,

and we're shooting
a documentary.

Why are you shooting
a documentary?

Well, when I was 10 years old,

my father murdered some people
in our basement.

And I just found out
that he murdered them

while an exorcism
was being performed.

<i>On him.</i>

<i>By clowns.</i>

<i>Without his pants.</i>

I'm sorry,
can we stop for a second?

<i>After six months
of going to trial,</i>

<i>my dad was proven not guilty</i>

<i>based on insanity,
but I didn't believe that.</i>

Wait a minute.

Yeah! Ragh! Ragh!

It's the Olympics. Whoo!

Oh! Hello. Ugh!

How about a five-way?

<i>A year later,
he was transferred</i>

<i>to one of the top psychiatric
facilities in the world.</i>

Which happens to be in Italy,

which is, like,
in a whole other country.

Are we recording?
We're on.

And this is camera one?
Yeah.

And this is camera two?

And this is the Steadicam.

And this is my 3D camera?

And this is
my motion-capture camera?

Okay.

Let's do this.

You came on a very good day
today, Miss Rosti.

Your father is
in very high spirits.

<i>Italy had cutting-edge
equipment, brilliant doctors.</i>

I need three CCs
of marinara, stat.

So listen, there's a good chance
he might not even remember you.

Okay.
Don't take offense to that.

It's just part of the disease.
Right.

Okay.

Let's just go
with one camera, okay? Great.

Dad? Do you remember me?

Connect the dots.

Connect the dots. Connect the
dots. Connect the dots.

Connecticut.
No, dumb-ass.

Connect the dots.

I'd rather play Candy Land
or Jenga or something...

I'd rather play Connect the Dots
and Dana Shut Up.

Okay.

Great. Now give me your phone.

What?
Give me your phone.

Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

I'm getting it out of my purse.
Give me your phone.

And, bam!

You just bought me
two Taiwanese hookers

for the price of one
on Croupon. Hm?

Listen, I came here

because I have to tell you
something really important.

Shh.

Dad.
Now get out of here.

I ain't got time for you
no more.

"Out," he said. Away with you.

Out. I'm a pretty princess.

Say it!
You're a pretty princess.

Louder!
You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Finally. Ling Mi One
and Ling Mi Two.

Who's sitting on my face first?

<i>Since that day,</i>

<i>I never went back
to see my old man.</i>

<i>While I was building a career,</i>

<i>I was looking for
the man of my dreams.</i>

<i>And I found him</i>

<i>the way all attention-seeking
narcissist slut-bags do.</i>

Dana.
Oh!

That's me.
That's not you guys.

Okay, here. Just hold that.
That's for you. Okay.

Will you accept this rose?

I would love to.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Want this? Yeah, oh,
ride that donkey.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Join in, dude. Join in.
Come on.

<i>Aaron and I fell in love</i>

<i>and got married
three months later.</i>

<i>He had a beautiful 2-year-old
daughter named Liz.</i>

And a New York strip for you,
young lady. Oh, I forgot.

<i>It was just a matter of time</i>

<i>before I picked up
the whole mothering thing.</i>

It's good.
All right.

Can't have a steak
without your steak knife.

Good girl.
Good girl.

Yummy.

Okay, eat up, ducky,
they're starving in Africa.

<i>Ah, Liz grew up so fast.</i>

<i>She was your typical
teenage daughter,</i>

<i>with a few issues to work out.</i>

Oh, no, honey, now, don't.
Don't... Ah!

<i>We had Jonah about a year ago.</i>

<i>People say
we're overprotective,</i>

<i>but I don't really see it.</i>

<i>Our family was growing,
so it was time</i>

<i>to move out of our cramped
one-bedroom rental</i>

<i>that we shared with
the 12-member Rodriguez family.</i>

<i>After an exhaustive search,</i>

<i>I found that the house
I grew up in was available.</i>

This is amazing.
It's so peaceful here, honey.

I know, sweetheart.

Another big milestone
for the Galen family.

Okay. Let's do this.

Okay.

Welcome to the new house,
everyone.

Well, this is
my beautiful daughter

coming down our new stairs.

There is my little man with
my favorite gal. Hello, sweetie.

Okay.

This house will work.

I just took the biggest
dump upstairs.

Felipe.

Yes, missus?
It's time for Jonah's bath.

Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, not
tonight, missus.

Just kidding.

Baby, come over here.
If I may propose a little toast?

Very romantic.
Oh, well, thank you.

To nothing but beautiful
memories in our new home.

Oh, babe.

I love you.
I love you.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Make sure you record
every moment.

This is gonna be
riveting to watch.

I just wanna document our first
full week in this house.

I'll edit it later.

It's all part of
the master plan, babe.

I'm gonna do it
at the same time.

It's so...

Ooh, text.

Yes.
What?

I got the meeting.

Honey, that's wonderful.
I know.

Oh, they wanna schedule it
for next week.

Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you.

This is a big deal, honey.
It's the Umbrella Corporation.

If I get this, I won't have
to consult for anyone again.

And you won't have to work
the corners anymore.

Oh, baby, you've worked
so hard for this.

Thank you.

Hey, you feel like
christening the new house?

Well, the kids are asleep.

You know how to turn me on.
Yeah?

Wanna move some boxes, baby?

Oh, the only box
I'm interested in is yours.

Either one of you losers
might wanna take care of this.

You should get out.

Mommy and Daddy
are playing gardener.

Order a pizza.

Mushrooms?

Green peppers and mushrooms.

First full night in this house,
total awesomeness.

Let me get this here.

There we go.

What? What? What is this mess?

Who tossed around
all the furniture?

Liz, what the hell
happened here?

Don't know. I was just about
to post my nudes on Twitter

and then I came in here
and saw this.

Baby? Dana?

What the hell?
Who redecorated the room?

You know,
it's actually pretty nice,

in a retro kind of way.

Honey, it looks like Neil
Patrick Harris threw up in here.

Oh, for chrissakes.

Oh, my God.

Wait. What?

Dana doesn't know how to cook.

Where did all this food
come from?

Aaron, what the hell
is going on here?

Yeah, Dad,
this is fucking weird.

But for some reason,
I wanna shoot it.

I don't know what
this is either.

Could be your classic
suburban burglar

or a practical joke
by Martha Stewart.

You're wrong on both counts.
Heh.

It's just sweet old me,
Paula Bean.

I just wanted y'all to taste
my new low-fat recipe.

Hey. Sorry I'm late.

You guys shooting a reality show
or something?

No. No, that's my daughter Liz.
Hi, babe.

Hey, sunshine.

You like things that dangle?

We're gonna saturate this space
with cameras.

Okay? I'm gonna put one up
in that corner.

Right? That way you get it
coming this way.

One up in this corner,
opposite direction, boom.

One from the dining room, bam.

Triangulation of coverage.

Put one over the stove, right,
get it pointed this way.

One on top of the TV,
pointed this way,

that way we get the full
coverage in here, okay?

All right, yeah. That's good.
Okay.

Oh, I forgot to put this
on the list.

Oh, you can install a camera
on this?

No. To fuck on.

Then I install a camera.
Ha-ha-ha!

Okay, there's more house.
Let's go.

We got one
directly above the crib

and then one over here
up the bunny's ass.

Hey.

This seems sturdy, right?

Good for a nice blowing, right?

You just slide in between
the slats and then...

We'll get another one right here
coming in.

We got this one
pointed directly this way

and then one
directly over the bed.

Wait, why our bed?
Don't worry about it.

Oh, look at this fucking
great bathroom.

Oh, shit,
this is fucking beautiful.

We're gonna stick one here
pointed at the bathtub.

We got one high in this corner,
directed at the shower.

And then one in the toilet.

Excuse me?
Huh?

What are you doing in my shower?

Get out, out, out.

Really?

Sorry.

These are my nieces.

I love the pool heaters.

I love the pool heaters.

I love the pool heaters.

Morning, honey.

Somebody slept in this morning.

I like sleeping.

Especially when it's
sweet dreams about you.

What?
What is that?

What?
There's writing on your face.

Oh, yeah, I do that every night.
It's good for the skin.

What the hell is going on here?

And this is exactly why
we have cameras,

so we can get to the bottom
of this stuff.

What the...

Oh, my God. Oh, my God, honey,
we have ghosts.

Okay, okay.
No, honey, it's okay.

I think you're being
a little over dramatic.

Oh, I'm sorry, really?
What would you call that?

It could be a million
different things.

Like what?

Could be the air conditioning,
window was left open.

Scientologists.

No. I am sorry, honey,
those are ghosts

and I am freaking out right now.

Okay, Dana. Dana, look at me.
Calm down, okay?

They're not ghosts.

There is no such thing
as ghosts. Trust me.

Okay, fine.

Attention, all ghosts.

If you're here with us right now
in this house

for the love of Jesus,
give us a sign.

Okay. I guess you're right,
honey.

Ohh...

Goddamn Scientologists.

I just don't understand
why this is happening to us.

I think I do.

What?

It all started when I was 7.

<i>I was getting drunk
with my sister.</i>

<i>We'd use tiny teacups,</i>

<i>that way our parents
never knew.</i>

Don't put that there.
Why?

Because Jeremy's sitting there.

Jillian, you gotta stop
with this ghost thing.

You sound crazy.

I'm not crazy,
I'm just telling you the truth.

Sorry, Jillian, that one was
a little tougher to pinch off.

Okay. Tea me up.

But Jeremy Lin wasn't even
a Knick back then.

And I didn't know
you had a sister.

She was deported
to Guatemala when I was 10.

But that's not the point.

The point is that
two years after that,

<i>my father killed the entire cast
of The Artist,</i>

including Uggie the dog.

Why? That was a great movie.

Frankly, I don't understand why
the whole film had to be silent.

But anyway,

it wasn't until I was
20 years old that I found out

my father killed those
people during an exorcism.

What?

I know. It's crazy, huh?
Yeah.

He's been in a psychiatric
hospital in Italy ever since.

Who's the person that
walked you down the aisle

and comes over
for the holidays?

Oh, sweetie.
He's just an actor.

His name's Joel Solomon.
He's very talented.

I called him Pop-Pop.

Listen, I...

I really think we should call in
the Ghost Brothers.

No way. Honey, those guys are
scam artists. You know that. No.

Okay. Are you coming to bed?

Not yet, I'm only halfway done
with this, honey.

I need at least 45 more minutes.

<i>d Babe d</i>

<i>d I've missed your touch d</i>

<i>d It's long since we... d</i>

I know, it's all gone.
Let's get something to eat.

Let's get some milk.

What the...?

I just bought two containers
of milk.

Who drank it all?

Hello, we are the Ghost
Brothers, here to investigate.

It is so thick in here, dude.
So many ghosts in the air!

I know what you mean. It's like
we're breathing in ghosts.

Dude, I am choking on a ghost
right now.

I am choking on a ghost.
Spit that ghost out.

Spit that ghost out right now.

Spit it out! I'll punch it out
if you want!

Guys!

You guys are professionals,
right?

Yeah, 100 percent.
We even have business cards.

Call me the middle man.
There you go. Super legit.

Call us because we're always
open. Daily.

Did you hear that?
That TV just turned on!

We're gonna die.
Here we go, let's go.

Rack them up, dude. This is
what we've been training for.

Uh...

I turned it on.

She turned it on.
So...

She's possessed by ghosts!
She's possessed by ghosts!

Oh, my Lord! I am a...

Oh, my God.

These ghost readings
are off the charts.

Dude, there are 57 ghosts
in that bathroom over there.

What?
Three in my pee stream.

Off the record.

Where are you getting
these numbers from?

A ghost was just born
in my hand.

What do we do?
Flamboyant scream?

Uh, duh.

Stop it! Stop!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Seriously? This is what
you brought into our house?

All right, so we found about 70
ghosts in your house total.

Fifty-five up there
in your bedroom.

Also, it's our day off,
so we charge double for that.

So, whatever you guys
think is fair.

So basically, free?

I was thinking moreover,
like, $3.

Fine, deal. Go.

Thank you so much.
Hell, yeah.

If you need us, we will be in our
van, watching the perimeters.

A door doesn't wake you?
You deaf?

I knew I had to step up my game

or I'd get kicked out
of the house.

I love the pool cleaners.
I love the pool cleaners.

I love the pool cleaners.

Oh, do the left nut.

Left nut.

Oh, my hair.

<i>d There's something about
The way you do your thing d</i>

<i>d I can't take
My eyes off you d</i>

Liz, you have a visitor.
What the...?

Good morning, young lady.

Hey. I was just
looking for my earring.

There it is.

Who said you could come
to my room?

Well, I apologize
for barging in.

Your mother gave me permission.

Well, what if I didn't
want you to come up?

I had a sneaking
suspicion you did.

And how's that?

By the very way
you were staring at me.

Say what? I wasn't staring
at you, dude.

I was writing in my journal.

Hm.

Look, I don't know what
you want, but I'm really busy.

I was just about to pierce
my pancreas.

Mm-hm.

d I just came To say hello d

d Hello d
d Hello d

Come to Abe.

Oh, shit-burger.

What?
Gotta go, babe.

Getting the hairy eyeball
from my sweet slut.

Yeah. Check you later, though.

Can't wait to get inside
that oval office.

Ugh...
Ah!

Stay free.

But wait!

I didn't even get to show you
my Apple product placement!

Is this thing on?

Hello, America!
Hello, America!

All right, we came here
expecting to find

a bunch of ghosts,
and guess what?

We did.

I didn't say any of that
just now.

You're possessed.
Dude, kill me.

I'm trying, but I can't.
Why?

Because I'm possessed, too.

We're both possessed by ghosts!
We're both possessed by ghosts!

Yes, Miss Liz?

I thought maybe we could talk.

Come on in. Come on.

Sit down.

Oh, uh...

Don't worry about that.
Felipe was just tanning.

Just some tanning.
There you go, sit down.

Oh! Heh, heh.

Don't worry, they don't bite.

Ay-ay-ay.

So, what can I help you with?

It's about a boy.

Of course it is.

His name is Abraham,
and I just don't know

if I've already blown it
with him.

I really like him.
I think about him all the time.

There are certain things
you can do to... How you say?

To win him over.

Like what?

It's called "Roofie and Bang."

A "Roofie and Bang"?

Mm-hm.

Ah! Just put one of those
in his Amaretto Sours,

and he's yours
for the rest of the night.

And the best thing is that
they wake up the next morning

not knowing I stuck my cheese
between their crackers.

Ha, ha! It's fabulous.
Have fun.

No.

Poor little baby.

Are you hungry?
Are you hungry, baby Jonah?

Come here.

Oh, just kidding.

Shh!

Help me!

Jesus Christ.
Dude, are you okay?

What the hell
is this doing here?

And who the hells are you?
You?

I'm directing. We're...

Ahh! Leave me alone!

Oh, sweet Lord.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no.

Oh, thank God.

If that thing had been left out
another hour,

we would've had ourselves
a murky pool.

Hey, Felipe.

Bam! Dutch oven, bitch.

<i>d Aw, baby d</i>

Oh, thank you, honey.

Your nose is cold.

Oh, baby, the eggroll.

Teeth, teeth, teeth.

Oh, you need a haircut.

There's so much...

Get it off me. Get it off me.

Good morning, sweetheart.

Hi.
Hi.

You know, I gotta tell you

that was a really nice surprise
you gave me last night.

Huh?

I'm telling you, baby,

it's moments like those that
make this marriage so exciting.

What? This...

You want to mess with me?

You've messed with
the wrong person, jerk-off.

Aaron, what are you doing?

Dana,
they have crossed the line,

and I am not taking
their crap anymore.

Sweetheart, please.

I think if we just lay low

and we don't interact,
they'll go away.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay, fine.
Okay. All right.

I'm giving it one week.

That's it.
Okay.

Got it?
Yes.

I've got a big interview and I
am not gonna have it screwed up

by a bunch of ghosts.
I understa...

Sweetie, we have to go.

We have to run those illegals
across the border.

Oh, my God. Is it noon already?
Baby, yeah.

Go, go.

Illegals don't keep in the heat,
sweetie.

<i>He maintains a strict

<i>Beat an egg white. I made it

<i>- Yes.
One, two, three, go.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, baby.</i>

Oh, that's right. Oh, that sort
of feels... Feels so good.

So smooth.
You're a dirty little one.

You're a dirty little minx.
Oh, you... Oh! Oh! Oh!

Look at it. Look at it. Oh!

And you thought we couldn't fit
20 of them into one van.

Well, once again, honey,
you were right.

Thank you, sweetie.

Honey,
do you smell something burning?

No.

Something's burning.

Ectoplasm.

Son of a bitch!

Aaron, you're wasting all of it.

Don't worry, honey. It's only
the cheap stuff from Tijuana.

I just don't get
what this is gonna prove.

It's gonna prove that we're not
going out of our minds.

If anyone or anything
is coming into this room,

we'll have a clear idea
of what we are dealing with.

Whoo!

What was that?

Holy sweet nuts.

Sweet potato pancakes,
would you look at that?

It's scary.

It's okay, baby. It's okay.

So scary.
Don't get too...

Oh, look.

Oh, honey, he's just
a witty-bitty thing.

Oh, it's so cute.

Oh, no. I knew it, honey.
He's a baller.

Oh, no.
It's okay.

You know what they say
about big feet.

Don't worry, baby.
Don't wo... Huh.

They end here.

This is weird.

Oh, my God.
Did you leave that open?

What, the...? Oh.

No.

Oh, we are so fucked.

I'm the raccoon
that snuck into your attic.

Scratchy scratchy.

Now your power bill's
through the roof.

If you got home insurance
where you got car insurance,

then you're gonna have to pay
for this all by yourself.

So get Upstate.
You'll save money

and be better protected
from mayhem like me.

Okay, ducky, so you wanna give
him his baba in half an hour

and give him the soy formula
because he's had a lot...

Bitch, I got it covered.

Get the hell out.
Okay. Bye, now, sweetie.

Okay. Okay. Oh.
And we're shoving now.

That's good.

He's okay. He'll walk it off.
Just go.

I got you. It's okay.
Bye, buddy.

You smell like a dumpster. Yeah.

My bad.

Dude, seriously?

Dude,
they dropped me all the time.

Look how good I turned out.

Is that John Wilkes Booth?
Where?

My mistake.
I hate that guy.

Me too.

Anyways, I'm glad you're here.

As am I.

You look thirsty.

Drink, drink, drink.

All the way.

Good boy.

Come to Abe.

Oh, yeah.

I'm Abe Lincoln.

Wow, you know,
I am feeling a little sleepy.

Don't fight it.

I want you to show me
the Lincoln Monument.

Yeah, I want you
to go to the South.

Yeah, take me to the South.

You wanna see
the Lincoln Monument?

Show it to me. Mm.

Sorry, bitch. He's mine.

What in tarnation?

You're in good hands now, papi.

Felipe was the one who created
the Roofie and Bang.

Hey! Let me out!

I want to free

Rats!

Oh. Your nipples, mm,

I'd like to invite you

Let me in!

Let me in!

Mom, Dad, it's me, Jonah.

Where do I start?

It was just supposed to be
for one night.

I wanted to be cool, you know?

I wanted to be more than just
a baby in the crib.

And then things got a little
out of control.

Excuse me! Excuse me, please!

You're all gonna have
to shut this down

or I'm gonna have
to call the cops.

It's about time we had
a proper date night.

Well, it was a wonderful night.

I'll tell you what
I am excited about.

Having a chocolate muffin
for dessert.

That is for tomorrow,
young man.

Wow.
Honey, there's no mess.

I'm so impressed.

I told you, Liz is responsible
to handle all of this.

You know, once again
you were right.

Thank you, dear.

Shh, shh.

Hey, Jonah.

Is that a wine cooler?

<i>Ooh! Look at that.
Honey Badger don't give a shit.</i>

<i>He'll just run through your

<i>Honey Badger don't care.</i>

It's not even fun anymore.

Honey?

Honey, wake up.
I already gave you a handy.

Did you hear that?

Something downstairs.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Damn it, no.

Oh, my God.

No!

Sweetie!

Damn it.
What is it?

Someone ate
my chocolate muffin.

Yeah.

Babe?

Oh, my God.

Oh,
that's seven years bad luck.

They swapped out
all the family photos.

I gotta document this.

Oh.

Honey?

Something's breathing on me.

And it smells like
chocolate muffin.

Wow.

A lot of them look like they're
from the turn of the century.

And now it's feeling me up.

Oh.
Ooh!

Who's a naughty ghost?

Wow, baby,
you gotta look at this.

The ghost's great
grandfather's ghost

is in a picture
with President Roosevelt.

Oh, yeah, you're a bad ghost!

Do it to me
like it's paranormal!

Looks like Hitler's ghost
is here.

Yeah! Yeah, fuck me
like you don't know me!

Oh, God,
you're such a big ghost!

God, I love poltergeists! Yeah!
Right, right, right.

Okay.

Whoa!

Close the door! Close the door!
Close it!

Sorry.

Hello. Hi. Come on in.
Hi.

We weren't expecting visitors.

Oh, no, that's okay.

It's small, but we get by.
Didn't mean to intrude.

Sit down,
welcome to our humble abode.

Welcome.
We know it's not much.

Hey, what you guys saw
back there, totally nothing.

Hey, we're not here to judge.
Yeah, no.

That was actually science, okay?
Yeah.

We can't really get into it
because it's...

Guys, it's fine.
It's fine. Listen.

Things are getting worse
at the house.

Um, hey, uh, why are you filming
all of this?

I just feel the need
to record everything.

Good call.
Yeah, good call, my man.

We actually do the same thing.

Camera twins.
Let's go.

Okay, look, guys,
Okay.

We really,
really need your help.

All right. Step number one.

You gotta hire yourself
a Hispanic gay manny, all right?

But he's not gonna do
any of his chores.

Instead, this is the kicker.

Here's the kicker.
I love this part.

This is great. He's gonna be
up in his room

all day with some secret lover

that nobody really knows
or understands at all.

I'm sorry.
Are you frigging kidding me?

What, effing?

You've just described
our manny Felipe.

Great. Awesome.
All right.

I'll check that one off.
Moving on.

All right, here we go.
Number two.

You're gonna have to do
a very bad job

at raising a teenage girl, okay?

That way she can have a very
rebellious phase in her teens.

I'm talking tattoos.
I'm talking piercings.

I'm talking things to do
with dragons. You get my drift?

You guys? Okay.

Great.
You guys already have that.

Here's number three.
Aaron, this is just for you.

All you gotta do is stumble upon
two naked dudes in their van.

That's it.
That's all there is to it.

Aaron! Aaron!

No, no!

Aaron!

No.

Fuck. I forgot the crisps.

Oh, good morning.

How long have you been up?
Honey?

You okay? Hello?

Dana?

Dana. Honey, talk to me.
What are you...?

Holy mother of cotton.

Dana. Baby?
Baby. Say some...

"Get out of my house...

...buttnuts"?

Hello?

Hello, sir.

You wanna come here?

No, no. That's fantastic, sir.
My house is your house.

Bye-bye.

Dana, that was the CEO
of the Umbrella Corporation.

He's coming here.
Isn't that great? Wha...?

Oh, right.

I've gotta figure out

how to get you depossessed
before he gets here.

But since you're
unconscious anyway...

No.

Okay.

Sluggy?

Sluggy Kornnutz,
exorcism specialist.

In the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ and all of his saviors,

I command you, evict this body

and return back to the bowels
of hell from whence you came.

Defiant one.

They hate this.

What? What? What?
What's going on?

She's being possessed by
the deadliest of demons:

Her inner demons.

We all have them. We try to
fight them on a daily basis,

whether it's eating

the last half-pint
of strawberry ice cream

or shooting up
an armful of smack...

Sluggy. Please.

Sorry.

Time to bring out the big guns.

What are you doing?
An intervention. Ahh!

Stop, stop. Stop it.

What? What's wrong?
You're not shooting my wife.

Suit yourself. We'll stick
with the chosen plan.

Oh! I'm okay. I'm back.

Mazel tov!
Mazel tov!

Ugh! Oh!

You've got 20 minutes
to knock my socks off.

But first, I need your bathroom.
I just sharted myself.

Very impressed.

You've got everything covered.
Thank you.

What do you know about
umbrellas?

I'm sorry?

What do you know about
umbrellas?

You...

...use them when it rains?

Aaron,

you're hired.

Oh, my God.

All right. Hi.
Oh, my God. Hey. Thanks, guys.

All right, enough.

Listen, I need to use
your bathroom again.

This time, not only did I shart,
but I peed myself too.

Of course...

You didn't pay
your electric bill?

That's a loser move.

Winners pay their bills.

No, no, no, I pay my bills.

All the time.
I'm a winner. Ask anybody.

There's a short.
There's a short in the breaker.

It happens all the time.

I know that
you've got a plane to catch,

so why don't we
just go out and...?

<i>Mm. Oh, thank you, honey.</i>

I've done some
messed-up shit in my life,

but that is insanity.

Aaron, you're fired.

What...? Wait, wait, no, no, no.
I can explain. I can explain.

Wait, sir. Sir. Right over here.
Look. Look in the closet. See?

We've got three umbrell... Look.
Look, one of the umbrellas

is already open
in case it rains in the house.

Sir, just give me one more
chance, please.

I'm gonna borrow your dog
for a few days.

I don't know if...
Fantastic.

<i>d Baby d</i>

<i>d There's something about
The way you do your thing d</i>

Generic? Loser.

Damn it.

Damn it! Shit!

Yes. Now, that felt good.
Bloody good.

So you think that's funny?

Why don't you come out and show
yourself, you son of a bitch?

Oh, you're so stupid.

Yeah, sure, it's easy to haunt
people when you're invisible.

Come out here, you wuss.
I'm a ghost.

Holy shit.
Calm down.

Now is not the time for fear.

That comes later.

What?

Huh? I said, calm down.

Now is not the time for fear.
That comes later.

I'm sorry, I'm not getting it.

You dumb-ass.

I said, calm down.

Now is not the time for fear.

That comes later.

Oh, okay. No, no, no,
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

Oh, shit. Oh, God. Ahh!

What on earth
is going on down there?

Honey, hi. You think
you could give me a hand?

Why is Manuel the Guatemalan
gardener shirtless?

<i>All right. I got you now.</i>

<i>Been waiting a long time.</i>

This is some good shit.
The best.

Buttery, isn't it?
Amazing.

That's my cock.

You'd think it would be
circumcised.

This is the scary part.

What the hell is going on?

Welcome! Welcome to the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

May the odds be ever
in your favor.

Oh, for the love of God,
please have mercy!

I don't want my ass
to be branded!

Oh, my God. Honey.

It's the Ghost Brothers.

Take that, douche bags!

You saved our lives.

Oh! Oh, thank you so much.

Oh, yeah,
we're getting out of here.

Oh! Oh, no.

Oh, no, dude.

Ohh!

Abe Lincoln, bro.

Hey, hey, hey, Abraham Lincoln!

What are you doing?

Killing ghost hunters.

But you're a vampire slayer.

Yeah, well, getting tea-bagged
by a ghost changes a man.

Oh, my God!

Ow!

No, no, no!
Please, don't! Don't!

Die, you son of a bitch.

Oh!
Die!

Abe Lincoln's getting Tased.

Leave my dad alone, bitch.

Liz?
Honey.

Honey, you look great.

What happened to you?

Guys, I'm so sorry
for being the rebellious,

skanky, slutty teenager
for so long.

You two deserve
better than that.

You've been
the most amazing parents,

and I love you both so much.

Oh, honey. We love you.
We love you.

Ah. Ow, ow. That's an ax.
That's an ax in my arm.

There is one more bit
of exciting news.

You got off the meth?
Your herpes cleared up?

You're not a lesbian anymore?

No. I met
the most amazing guy,

and he's brought
so much positivity

to my life on so many levels.

Mom and Dad,
meet my new boyfriend Otto.

Isn't he the sweetest?

Does Otto have
a five-year plan?

Uh, he's Jewish.

Oh, I love Jews.
That's a good plan. I like it.

<i>I stood face to face
and fought off an attack,</i>

<i>and I know that you want
all of the facts.</i>

<i>So stick a fin in your ear
and dig out the wax!</i>

Oh...
Felipe!

I'm just kidding!

<i>The cameras they had taped
and the mouse was afraid</i>

<i>that his ass would get laid.</i>

<i>If my ass would get laid!</i>

Hey, gang!
Dad?

I know, I know.

Yeah, I got kicked
out of the hospital

for lewd misconduct,
whatever that means.

So I thought I'd stay with you.

Oh, no, we don't have the...

Cool. Come in, ladies.
We got company.

Awesome. Discount whores.

The best.

This is, uh, uh, uh...

Bah!

Okay, well, if you need me,

I will be upstairs
doing the Jamaican Donut.

Yeah. It's like yoga,
except it's stinky.

Then we'll do
a Pittsburgh Platter,

Cleveland Steamer.
We'll mix it up.

So that was your real father?

Yeah.

I like him.

I like him a lot.

Are you effing kidding me?

This is the biggest piece
of crap video I've ever seen.

I know. We aren't
getting squat for it.

I don't know.

Well, I thought it was
pretty damn good.

Could one of you be a dove and
get me another tub of popcorn?

Extra butter, please,
with a splash of patchouli oil?
