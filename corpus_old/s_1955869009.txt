So what, maybe you
piss out of the window?

I don't think I have
the right equipment

for that Uncle Gus.

Eh, nobody's perfect kiddo.

Look, I called the Super,

and left a message, so,

we'll see what happens.

I gotta get a look
at this dump, hah.

It's not a dump, it just
needs some sprucing up.

Yeah well you
wanna spruce it up,

you gotta come by
here and pick up

some of that lady shit you left.

Yeah you could move a
million times over

and I'd still gotta be
tripping over boxes

of tampons and nail polish.

Glad you're
keeping busy, look,

I got a lot more
moving in to do here,

okay, so I'll see
you on Tuesday.

Excuse me, sir, can
you spare a moment

to talk about the whales?

Hello miss, can you
spare a moment to talk

about the whales?

You see, we here at
Whale Savers are...

Hello sir, can you
spare a moment

to talk about the whales?

What?

Well we here at Whale
Savers are committed

to the conservation and
protection of all whale life.

Huh?

Particularly in
the Antarctic and

the Northwestern Pacific Oceans.

What?

Are you aware of what's
going on in these waters?

No, no...

Hey is that your lady?

She's pretty hot, for a drawing.

You know what's not hot?

CO2 powered grenade
tipped harpoons,

penetrating your ribs
at 370 feet a second,

detonating inside you,
bursting your organs,

shattering your spine,
blades retracting

on your insides as
you're winched aboard

a ship filled with butchers
who hack and slice

your body into tiny
little pieces,

all while you're
still breathing.

These were taken on the deck of

the Obagi Maru, one
of the most notorious

and brutal whaling ships
in the Antarctic.

You see, we here
at Whale Savers...

Hey dude, I'm trying
to eat here man.

Excuse me sir, could
you spare just a moment

to talk about...

You're being too polite.

Huh?

These people are
sheep, all they wanna do

is follow the herd, you
have to shock them

out of their habit.

At orientation they
told me to stick

to the script.

No one ever became great
by sticking to the script.

Here, let me show you.

Excuse me sir!

Take a look at the
atrocities that occur

on the Obagi Maru!

What the fuck dude?

That's all right, I got it.

Does that happen a lot?

It comes with the territory.

Look, Danni, this is
important work we're doing.

I don't know what you did
before you came here,

but this is life and death.

It's after news hour.

A string of bizarre
animal attacks

stirred up northern New
Jersey last night.

Peekskill resident Ginny
Hernandez was mauled

to death as she opened up
her deli in the early hours

this morning.

Sheriff Douglas remains
baffled as to the cause,

stating: "I've never..."

I don't know maybe it got
sucked down the drain.

Hah, maybe a fucking ninja
came through the window.

All the windows were locked,

and the chain was
still on the door.

When the Super is
done I'm gonna see

if there's another way
into the apartment

I don't know about.

You sure you didn't dream
about putting it up?

I mean, I dream about
boring shit all the time.

No, I put it up.

Yeah, after how many beers?

All right, all right,
all right, okay.

So what are you
gonna do about it?

I'm gonna call the
management company

and have the locks changed.

But you said the
chain was on the door.

Hey what are you
doing in there anyway?

I got a potluck for the VA.

I thought you hated the VA?

You always said it smells
of piss and death.

It does smell,
but I got a deal

on some cheap shrimp.

This is all garbage,
you can toss it.

You sure?

Positive.

Enjoy the fiesta.

Danni?

I thought that was you!

Oh hiya Beth.

How have you been?

Good and you?

Oh, exhausted.

I just got off a double.

Oh right.

The girls and I were
just talking about

you the other day.

Are you still living
with your uncle?

Uh no, actually I
moved into a new place.

Good, oh good, we were hoping

that would be the case.

I'm so glad you're getting
back on your feet.

Oh my gosh, my
bachelorette party,

this Saturday!

Tom and I finally set a date.

Did you know that he's
teaching at Columbia now?

It's kind of a big deal.

But you should totally
come, have a cocktail,

maybe three.

I don't know I'm
still kinda moving in.

You know I gotta go
because this is my stop,

but, oh, it was so good
catching up with you,

I'll tell the girls that
you said hi, all right?

Hey, call me!

Hmm-mm.

Hey I'm Preston the Super.

Oh I thought you were
fixing the toilet.

Oh yeah yeah, I'm
almost done with that.

There's still a little
architectural work.

I'm real good with my hands.

Hey did you come
in here earlier

while I was sleeping?

You that chick in 7A?

'Cause she got it all wrong,

I went in there to
fix the radiator,

how was I to know she
sleeps to the noon?

My shower curtain, it's gone.

Oh...

Well it wasn't me.

Meaning you got a ghost.

Ohohoho...

Look, stick to
taking baths lady.

Everybody loves bubbles.

Blue is better.

These were taken
on the deck of

the Obagi Maru, now they're
just an artist rendition,

I haven't really had the
chance to color in all

of the blood yet, but
I can assure you

they're an exact replica
of the pictures taken.

Uhuh, yep, I know all
about those photos.

Oh, well so then you
know how much a donation

would make a difference.

What I don't get
is why you're here.

Well I represent Whale Savers,
and we are trying to...

No what I mean is, how
come you're wasting

your time on nickel and
dime street donations,

I mean shouldn't you be out
there with those guys,

uh, what's their name again?

Sea Saviors?

Yeah, that's it.

You should join them, I mean,

if you really care.

Well I've had my fill
of assholes today,

you wanna grab a bite?

Hey!

Huh?

Nothing, I just
wanted to see if

you wanna grab some
lunch, but if you're busy

that's cool.

Uh no, yeah, I
guess I could eat.

What'cha looking at?

Holy shit that's incredible!

I know, keep it down.

This is huge, what
are you gonna do?

I'm gonna move out.

Move out, are you
crazy, think of the good

you could with this, think
of the possibilities.

No it's fine, I'm just,
I'm gonna move back in

with my Uncle Gus,
back on that couch,

but I'll be far away
from whatever this is.

I have an idea.

Well, I don't need any
ideas, I only showed you this

to check I'm not losing my mind,

I'm not, job done,
thanks for your help.

These curtains must go
somewhere, all right.

So, all we do is,
write down our number

and wherever it goes,
someone's bound to call.

How's that gonna get
rid of this thing?

Because if we know where
the curtains are going,

maybe we can do
something to stop them,

you know, plug the
hole or something.

No, I don't have
to plug anything

if I just walk away.

All right, suit yourself.

Enjoy that couch.

Hey, what's your phone number?

Why, this is your idea,

use your own number.

My phone is still in the shop.

Okay fine, but you
have to deal with

whoever calls, okay?

Okay, I'm all
set, are you ready?

I guess.

Okay, here we go.

How long do we have to wait?

Ugh, I think we have
to leave for it to work.

Oh.

Take two.

So how long before someone
calls, do you think?

I don't know, hopefully never.

Hand me some soy sauce.

How do you think
they get it in there?

Machines?

Yeah but how, like they
must use some kind of

adhesive to put the two
pieces of plastic together.

Who's that?

Oh, that's me
and my Uncle Gus.

He raised after my mom died.

So you're a nurse?

I was a nurse.

What kind?

Hospice mostly, last
few years anyway.

That's for when the
people are dying, right?

Yup.

I wonder where they go.

What?

The curtains?

Oh, I don't care, I
just want 'em to stop.

They must be going
somewhere right,

like an alternate
dimension maybe?

Or they're just vaporized.

I like to think it's
nice, wherever it is.

And nothing bad could
ever happen there,

like everything is safe,
even the shower curtains.

And the whales.

All right can't you
just picture them?

Swimming through the
galactic ocean,

eating space krill?

Singing their beautiful songs.

Not really.

Maybe you're right.

Any place would be
an improvement.

To the galactic ocean.

Did anyone call?

Uh no.

Are you making breakfast?

No.

Oh okay.

I gotta go anyway.

I got a second job
at Sandwich City.

Sure.

Well, keep an eye
on that phone, okay?

Someone's bound to call, I
can feel it in my bones.

Hello?

Hey Uncle Gus.

You're wasting your time.

I'm sorry?

Half of New York is gonna
be under water in 10 years.

Whales are gonna be
swimming down Park Avenue.

And I'm gonna have to
fit this into a bikini.

Uh well the threat
to whales right now

is still very real, and
any donation would help,

you see, we here...

Save me the guff sweetheart,
will you take a check?

Sure.

Oh wow, thank you.

Thank you so much.

Why do I have so
much junk in here?

Excuse me.

Hello?

Yeah, I'm calling
for Danni and Jim.

Uh this is Danni and Tim.

Miss?

Tim, all right, hold on.

Hello?

Who do I make
this check out to?

Hello?

We're actually a
little busy right now.

Hey I gotta open up,
there's something

jamming, hang on.

You're busy, I got a
million things to do,

I'm trying to give you
money and you say

you're too busy, you're faking!

All right, jeez.

Fuck you.

Oh it does say Tim.

What says Tim?

The shower curtain.

It's some guy who says
he has the shower curtain.

What's his name?

Uh who may I ask is calling?

This here is Willy.

Well hi Willy.

Yeah that's ours, where
did you find it?

That's tough to say.

Well why is that?

Is there a reward?

Ah, he wants to know
if there's a reward.

I have 20 dollars.

How's 20 dollars?

How's 200?

200?

Are you crazy, we're not
gonna give you 200 dollars

for a shower curtain.

Hi Willy this is Tim.

Hi, yeah, how are
you doing today?

Super, look can I just
ask you one question?

How do you feel about CO2
powered grenade tipped

harpoons?

No, it's a device used to
brutally murder whales,

and do you know who invented it?

Evil scientists.

We are good scientists, Willy,

and we're about to unlock
one of the greatest

scientific mysteries
of all time.

Alternate dimensions.

Tim, give me the phone.

But we can't do it without
that shower curtain.

Now, unlike evil scientists,

we don't have a lot of money.

Harpoons, guns, tanks,
these inventions

have done nothing but bring
sadness to this world,

but, if you help us
Willy, the entire planet

will be lining up
to shake your hand.

Hello?

Uh, I'm sorry what?

Yeah, yeah, I'll help
you pick one out.

I'll see you then.

So?

He says that 20 dollars
is fine, but if we become

famous and go on TV,
he wants us to buy him

a tuxedo.

He's in Jersey, he wants us
to meet him at exit 85A,

at Leo's Diner in two hours.

From now?

Yeah, do you wanna get
rid of this thing or not?

That was pretty cool the
way you closed the deal

with that guy.

It's my job.

One of my jobs anyway.

Oh right, at Sandwich Town.

Sandwich City, actually.

Yeah it sucks, I know,
but I'm saving my money

to get on the Sea Savior.

I'm gonna help take
down the Obagi Maru.

No more nickel and diming
people on the streets

for donations.

Cut the monster off at the head.

How long have you been saving?

Been three years in October.

It must cost a lot
to be an activist huh?

Yup.

But who knows what doors
this curtain thing

is gonna open up, right?

I guess.

You guess?

We're gonna be on the
cover on magazines

before the year is out.

Let's just go.

Maybe he's just
running a little late.

He's not here Tim.

Nobody is here, the
only kind of person

that would hang around here

would be a complete lunatic.

Someone's in there.

In there, really?

Tim!

You know, I, I
think I was wrong,

I didn't see anything,
come on let's go.

You saw something,
maybe we can look around

the corner.

Tim come on, this is
stupid, let's just go.

I'm gonna take a look inside.

Tim!

Tim, don't go in there!

Why not, it's
just an old diner,

I'm just gonna take a look.

We've come this far
already, right?

Yeah Danni you're right
there's nobody in there.

Is that him?

I don't know.

Ask him.

Are you Willy?

Are you the shower
curtain people?

Yeah, I'm Danni
and this is Tim.

Hi.

Well you don't look
like scientists.

What do scientists look like?

Show him the video.

Goddamn!

You are scientists!

Frankie is gonna love this!

Okay Willy, do you
have the shower curtain?

Yes ma'am, I got
it safe around back!

Oh?

Come over, I'll show you!

I don't like this one bit.

Come on, he's harmless!

It's in there.

You got that 20 dollars?

Yeah.

Be careful, it's stinky.

Is it in there?

It worked.

It stinks.

I told you, that's snot
junk was on when I found it.

What, you mean you
didn't find it here?

Nope.

Then where?

In a creek.

Well then we have
to go to this creek,

can you take us there?

You never said
nothing on the phone

about going nowhere.

Do you think he's
still in there?

Yeah, why wouldn't he be?

I don't know, he's not
the most stable guy,

maybe he ran off or something?

Well if he did, we
always have plan B.

What's plan B?

I'm glad you asked.

It's something I
thought of last night.

Remember those soy sauce packets

that we were talking
about before?

Yeah.

Well...

Sorry, had to hook
the new syrup up

to the doohickey.

Want some?

No.
I'm good.

Suit yourselves.

So, Willy, now that
you've done your shopping,

you mind showing
us to the creek.

Oh I'll show you the creek.

I'm gonna you show everything
you wanna see, don't worry.

Willy I don't think I
can have that in the car.

Don't worry, it's an old
trick Frankie taught me.

Take a ride out of
here, keep going

until you see an old barn.

How far did you say
after that barn?

We're real close.

So Willy, how close is
the creek to your home?

The creek is my home.

Oh.

Does Frankie live there too?

Why is that funny?

Frankie hates the creek.

It spooks him something nasty.

All right Willy,
that's enough.

I said that's enough.

What?

What?!

Stop.

Why, is this it?

Stop the car.

Willy is this it?

Danni, Danni!

Shit!

Well, at least you
found the creek.

Do you see him?

He's probably
passed out somewhere.

Hey, sorry kids.

Sorry, I just drained my tank.

Is this where you found
the shower curtain, Willy?

Uhuh, I find all
kinds of shit in here.

Where exactly did you find it?

It was right over there.

Or was it over there?

No no, it was over there.

You go that way,
I'll go the other.

I sure hope we get on the TV!

Frankie always said I had
a face for the shows.

What you get my cup for?

It's litter, it's
bad for environment.

Oh I'm sorry.

It's fine, just try
not to do it again.

Oops!

Don't worry I'll pick them up.

Hey pick a color.

What, are you a painter?

I ain't shit, Frankie taught
me this other trick you see.

Willy, who is Frankie,
is he your friend?

I'll tell you if
you pick a color.

Yellow.

You picked a great color.

Oh you don't wanna
be doing that.

It's Frankie time!

Tim!

It comes up out of the ground.

It's kinda like you,.

Are you okay?

It's time to go.

We're gonna leave now Willy.

Frankie!

Scientists!

Scientists!

Scientists!

Scientists!

Scientists!

Are you guys good scientists,

or bad scientists?

Are you okay?

Yeah I'm fine.

What did you find in the creek?

I don't know, there
was a lot of junk

in those rocks.

The curtain could've floated
downstream from somewhere.

We have to find out where
that somewhere is.

Right?

Thanks.

I don't think we
should put up anymore

shower curtains, Danni.

But how else are we
gonna plug the hole?

I'm not so sure that we can.

But you, you can't
get cold feet now.

You started this whole thing.

What about plan B?

No, no, I just
think that we need

another opinion.

You know, like an
expert or something.

Well there's this girl Beth
that I used to work with

at St. Mary's, her fiancee
is some big wheel

in the Physics
Department at Columbia,

maybe he can help us out?

Yeah, yeah, I think that
might be the best way to go.

Okay, I'll give her a call.

Good, are you gonna be okay?

Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

Ssshht...

You're not Bert.

No, no, no I'm not Bert.

You're not Bert.

But you've been
putting up curtains.

Bring her here.

No, no, no!

I won't put up anymore
curtains, I won't.

Raise your left
hand and swear it.

I swear I won't put
anymore curtains.

Good.

No, no!

You're a part of it now.

Chosen by The Gate,

a sacred oath sealed in flesh.

You violate the oath,

we violate the flesh.

Danni?

I got my phone back
from the shop.

They erased all my
Whale Saver ringtones,

but I should be able
to get those back.

What happened to your hand?

I burned it.

Oh, looks painful.

So did you talk to
that Beth chick yet?

I got a new lead.

What is it?

Bert.

Who's Bert?

A fucking weirdo.

Batshit Bert.

In and out of psych wards,

always seeing things.

Talking to himself.

You know the type.

Well what happened,
why did he move out?

He never moved out.

No?

Shit you guys don't know?

He took a goddamn
razor to his neck.

In the tub, fucking
selfish if you ask me.

Hell of a cleanup job.

Would you know I
was the only one

at that fucker's funeral?

Not another soul.

They didn't even serve
sandwiches or anything.

Did he leave anything
behind, a note or something?

No.

I threw all his stuff out.

What about that?

Oh that's just a
few of his books.

I keep it for the titties.

You guys know I want
that back right?

Only an untainted
membrane will bring

forth The Yonder in
its purest visage.

To keep The Yonder
at bay, The Gate

must be mapped with blood.

The Gate.

What does that mean?

Okay you two, time to go,

you're freaking me out.

But the book!

I said, I keep it
for the titties.

What did he mean by The Gate?

He?

The book.

I don't know, but we
shouldn't be messing with

this alone.

Where's your phone, I'm
gonna call your friend.

I deleted her number.

But I thought we agreed...

What am I gonna say?

My shower curtains
are being sucked

into some alternate
dimension, how you doing?

It's a start!

No, she'll just
say that I'm crazy.

But we have the
footage, the curtain from

the creek, they can run tests,

scientific shit.

It's not gonna happen.

Then, what are we gonna do?

We put up another curtain.

No, look, just
gimme until morning.

And I'll come up with
something that doesn't

involve putting
up more curtains.

You look tired, maybe
you should go back

to your uncle's for a
while, get some rest.

No, this is my apartment.

I'm not going anywhere.

Okay, then just promise
me you'll stay away

from this bathroom.

Sure.

Oh my God...

Hello?

Danni?

Hey Danni.

Danni?

Good to see you too.

I love what you've
done with the place.

Now is not a good time, Gus.

I'm in the middle of something.

So what did you
do with your hand,

is that a fashion statement?

All these numbers,
they're the key

to everything I just know it.

What numbers?

On my curtains.

Here, see for yourself.

I mean do you see?

The numbers that glow,
they mean something,

I just gotta figure
out what it is.

That's pretty neat.

So what is this, one
of those app thingies?

You got a plate or something?

When I quit St.
Mary's, you never once

asked why, you know that?

Well it's because
I didn't think

there was anything
to talk about.

You didn't like a
job, and you quit,

I mean that happens
everyday right?

I wasn't well.

So where's your TV,
I wanna watch a game.

I'm not gonna ignore
this Gus, I can't.

So uhm...

So what do you want me to do,

you want me to leave?

I'm saying that sometimes
there are more important

things than beer and donuts.

Uncle Gus?

I come bearing gifts.

You know how about a
healthy meal for a change?

You know that guy at
the farmer's market,

he's really not so bad, and
no more bargain shrimp.

Only fresh from now on.

You have one unheard message.

Hey kiddo it's me.

What you said before...

Look, I never asked why you left St.
Mary's

because I just didn't
wanna make it worse.

And ever since your mom
died I've been trying

not to make things worse.

The thing is beer and donuts
can't solve everything.

Anyway that video, those numbers

you were talking about, I think
I may have figured 'em out.

These old sailor's eyes might
still be good for something,

give me a call back
and I'll fill you in.

End of message,
delete, press seven.

Tim!

Tim!

What?

Some chick's here to see you.

I need your car.

What are you doing
with all those curtains?

Coordinates, the numbers
on the bathroom wall

they're coordinates.

What numbers?

I worked 'em out and
it's Peekskill, Jersey,

just a mile north of that creek.

I'm gonna go up there
and you're gonna

hang these curtains.

Danni, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

Do you ever get tired
of being chickenshit?

All that money you've
been saving up

to get out to the Antarctic?

Cut the monster off at the head.

Three years and you
haven't done anything.

You present yourself as
this die-hard activist

but you don't ever fucking act.

I lied to you about my hand.

I can't explain right now,

but my Uncle Gus,

he's dead and it's all my fault.

I'm gonna get to the
bottom of this Tim,

I need your help.

Danni.

Danni.

Did she leave?

Uh yeah.

Uh she took your keys too.

What?

Don't be mad, I gotta do this.

I have an app on my phone

that follows the Obagi Maru.

I tracked their course,

I know the shit they
pull every single day,

but I just can't bring
myself to actually

go out there.

I guess I am chickenshit.

Tim, I...

Is it true about
your Uncle Gus?

Yeah.

I'll be at your apartment
in half an hour.

I guess I go east.

I'm here.

So what's it look like?

I'm in the middle
of a ditch somewhere,

and there's not much out here.

Are you ready?

Okay, it's up, shall
I close it now?

Yeah.

Danni?

What?

Just be careful.

What's happening?

Ssshht!

What's happening?!

Nothing, nothing is happening.

I have a bad feeling
about this Danni,

why don't you just come back?

I must've typed it in wrong,

or the phone screwed up.

I just felt something.

It felt like it came from the...

Something is coming
out of the ground.

Tell me what you see, Danni.

It's the shower curtain,

there's something inside it.

Oh God, it smells just
like that other one.

I don't like this
Danni, just leave.

I'm gonna go look inside.

What is it?

It looks like...

Danni!

911 what's our emergency?

My friend Danni,
she's in the woods

and something happened.

Does she need an ambulance?

I don't know, we were
talking on the phone

and then I heard
screaming and then,

please you just have
to help her now.

Okay, where did this happen?

She followed
these coordinates.

Sir, where...

21, dash 14, dash...

No!

Okay just slow down sir.

Can you tell me an address
or a cross street?

Sir, are you still there?

I can't find it.

Okay calm down,
everything is going

to be fine, take a deep
breath and go slowly.

Can you tell me your name?

We don't have time
for this, we've got

to get to her now.

Calm down sir,
we can help you,

but we need to
know where she is,

now, what are these coordinates?

Sir?

Are you still there?

Sir?

I know how to save her.

Where are we going?

Dig.

What for?

When you're done
with the first hole,

start another.

So these, they're all me?

Only one chose by The Gate

can bring forth from The Yonder.

So you're telling
me, that every time

I hang a shower curtain,
my bathroom wall

sends it to that ditch over
there and gives birth to,

well, that.

You gave birth to that.

Huh?

You raised the membrane.

You violated the oath.

Oh fuck that, let's
just go back to

my apartment and burn
it down right now.

The Gate will protect itself.

Its wrath shines
brightest on those who

try to destroy it.

What now?

No, but The Gate, it chose me!

And The Gate will
choose another.

Your chapter is closed.

It's already chosen.

It's been.

What the hell are you?

Talk to me!

Talk to me!

Hi this is Tim, I'm
not here right now,

but please leave a message.

And remember, save the whales!

Tim, I'm coming back.

Tim?

Tim?

Tim are you in there?

Plan B.

No...

No.

Miss Smith?

I'm here to check that toilet.

Shit...

I told her to stick
to taking baths.
