Histories, like ancient ruins,

I want to be a tailor.

Childhood, adults always say,

is the happiest time in life.

But as long

Jack Fairy knew better.

Until one mysterious day,

when Jack would discover that
somewhere there were others...

quite like him,

singled out for a great gift.

And one day,

the whole stinking world...

would be theirs.

The streets of London are ablaze...

in sparkle makeup
and glittering frocks...

as the boys and girls of
the current glam-rock craze...

pay tribute to their patron saint,
pop star Brian Slade,

and his space-age rock persona,
Maxwell Demon.

[ Man ]
Brian Slade, heâ€™s just so different.
I've never seen anyone like him.

Lipstick Traces- his last albumâ€”
was just something special to me.

It was an album that just
appealed to so many people.

[ Announcer ]
A palpable whir of anticipation...

can be felt outside
London's Lyceum Theatre...

as fans await the final show
of Slade's smash world tour.

Security around the performer
has tightened...

following a recent BBC interview
in which he admitted...

to premonitions of
being assassinated on stage.
Turn it off.

That hasn't deterred
any of his enthusiastic
and colorful followers,

some of whom have been
queuing here since-
[ Knock On Door ]

[ TV Continues ]
Brian, time.

[ Audience Screaming,

[ Man On P.A. ]
Ladies and gentlemen.

The Lyceum Theatre,

in cooperation
with Bijou Music,

is proud to present...

straight back from their
fantastically successful
European tour,

Maxwell Demon
and the Venus in Furs!

[ Narrator]
For once, there was an unknown land,

full of strange flowers
and subtle perfumes;

a land of which it is
joy of all joys to dream;

a land where all things
are perfect and poisonous.

â™ª Well, you're the grand one â™ª

â™ª Have you noticed â™ª

â™ª When you're walking
all the fella boys are fella nervous â™ª

â™ª Well, my starship
doesn't want me â™ª

â™ª And neither does his wife â™ª

â™ª I'm glad I caught you
on my view screen â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]
[ Male Announcer ]
It appears today's youngsters...

have fashioned a whole new bent
on the so-called...

sexual liberation
of the flower power set.

The long hair and love beads
have given way to glitter makeup,

platform shoes
and a whole new taste...

for glamour, nostalgia
and just plain outrageousness.

Is London not shocked?
London is improving.

Well, I think it's a disgrace,
parading around all ponced up...

like a pack of
bleeding woofters.

Bloody hell,
what'll they think up next?

â™ªâ™ª [ Vocalizing ]

[ Announcer Continues ]
And heading up this flash stampede...

is none other than
pop giant Brian Slade,

whose stylish escapades have
paved the way for a whole new
breed of performing artists,

from Curt Wild
and the Flaming Creatures...

to Jack Fairy and Pauly Small.

Thanks to Slade,
today's youngsters are singing
a whole new tune.

[ Male Interviewer]
So you're saying you're a bisexual?

Yeah. I like boys, I like girls.

They're all great.
No difference, is there...

Mr. BBC?

Rock music has always been
a reaction to accepted standards.

And homosexuality has been
going on for centuries.

At the moment,
having a gay image is the "in" thing.

You know,
just like a few years ago,

it was trendy to wear
a long gray coat...

with a Led Zeppelin record
under your arm.

Everyone's into this scene because it's
supposedly the thing to do right now.

But you just can't fake
being gay, you know?

If youâ€™re gonna claim
that you're gay,

you're gonna have to
make love in gay style.

Most of these kids just
aren't gonna make it.

That line, "everyone's bisexual,"
it's a popular thing to say now.

Personally,
I think it's meaningless.

â™ª Ooh, the sun
but it's a crime â™ª

â™ª Your mystique â™ª

â™ª A momentary seizure â™ª

â™ª Oh, love â™ª

"I knew I should create a sensation,"
gasped the rocket,

and he went out.

[ Film Projector Whirring ]

[ Indistinct Chattering ]

[ Man ]
Okay, Lionel, that's it. Thanks.

[ Woman ]
I don't get it.
[ Man #2 ] What don't you get?

It was a stunt.
The guy faked his own murder.

Yeah, but why?
Publicity.

Arthur, any recollection?

Of what?
With this Slade fellow?

Well, he's a...
early '70s glam-rock singer.

Told you we can count on
Mr. Old Time Rock and Roll.
[ Laughter ]

Count on me for what?

I thought I was on
the Reynolds trip.

[ Man ]
Well, you are, but the president
isn't due until the eighth,

and I need a piece
for the Weekender now.

Great.
Oh, now, look.

Next week is the tenth-year anniversary
of the whole shooting stunt incident.

I'd like you to find out
what happened, where he is today.

"Whatever happened
to Brian Slade?"

Okay?
Yeah, and, uh,

naturally you want me
for this because, um,
I'm the resident Brit, right?

No. No, no, no.

I want you because you remember.

[ Man On P.A. ]
President Reynolds is urging
young people everywhere...

to sign up at their
local government offices...

and join the Committee-

[ Arthur Narrating ]
Because I remember.

Suddenly I was being paid
to remember all the things...

that money, the future
and a serious life
made so certain I'd forget.

And for what?

Some meaningless prank
a decade old.

Why was it suddenly up to me
to figure it out...

when clearly
there was something,

something from the past,
spooking me back?

I didn't realize at the time
that it was you.

Yesterday upon the stair,

I saw a man that wasn't there.

He wasn't there again today.

How I'd wish he'd go away.

[ Arthur Narrating ]
Ten years.

Ten years, and the world
had changed so completely...

that the life I led in England
seemed like someone else's life.

Someone else's story.

Anyone's but mine.

[ Man ]
"There were times when
it appeared to Dorian Gray...

"that the whole of history
was merely a record of his own life.

"Not as he had lived it
in act and circumstance,

"but as his imagination
had created it for him,

"as it had been in his brain
and in his passions.

"He felt that
he'd known them all,

"those strange, terrible figures
that had passed along
the stage of life...

"and made sin so marvelous
and evil so full of subtlety.

"It seemed that
in some mysterious way,

their lives had been his own."

â™ª I won't laugh at you

Nothing.

â™ª Of love, of love â™ª

â™ª Well, you're the grand one â™ª

â™ª Have you noticed â™ªâ™ª

[ Male Announcer ]
Today in London,
officials confirmed...

that the shooting
on the fifth of February
of singer Brian Slade...

at London's Lyceum Theatre
was a publicity stunt...

mounted by the singer's company,
Bijou Music Limited.

Manager Jerry Devine
announced today that...

his company meant no harm
in their escapades,

that it was intended
solely as entertainment.

Very sad and unfortunate
that in this day and age,

an artist's quest for artistic freedom...

should cost him his career.
[ Reporters Shouting ]

Why do you think?

[ Sighs ]
I don't know.

No, it got too big, I guess.

Too- Got too schizoid.
You know?

I mean, he thought
he fuckin' was Maxwell Demon
in the end, you know?

And Maxwell Demon,
he thought he was God.

â™ª We must â™ª

â™ª But if it all works out nicely â™ª

â™ª You'll get the bonus
you deserve â™ª

â™ª From doctors we trust â™ª

â™ª The fat lady of Limberg â™ª

â™ª Looked at the samples
that we sent â™ª

â™ª And furrowed her brow â™ª

[ Man ]
Brian Slade?

â™ª You would never believe that â™ª
Oh, yes.

Quite well.

Once upon a time.

So?
Yes?

So, um,
what was he, umâ€”

What was he like?

Who's that? Brian?

Yeah.

Like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

And in the end,

like nothing he appeared.

He was... elegance,

walking arm in arm
with a lie.

His real name,
in fact, was Thomas,

and his father owned
a small tiling business
in suburban Birmingham.

But Brian never cared much
for the suburbs,

and, as a young boy, had the rare
fortune of spending a summer
in London with his auntâ€”

a figure of some ill repute
in the Slade family...

after she married a cockney
in the entertainment field...
[ Audience Applauding ]

and followed him off
to Deptford.

â™ª I never was a one
to go and stiff myselfâ™ª

â™ª If I like a thing, I like it
That's enough â™ª

â™ª But a lot of people say
that if you like a thing a lot â™ª

â™ª It'll grow on you
and all that sort of stuffâ™ª

â™ª Oh, I've always held
in having it if you fancy it â™ª

â™ª If you fancy it
that's understood â™ª

â™ª And suppose it makes you fat
I don't worry over that â™ª

â™ª 'Cause a little of what
you fancy does you good â™ªâ™ª

[ Horns Honking ]
[ Audience Laughing ]

[ Moaning ]

[ Coughing ]

[ Moaning Continues ]

[ Man Narrating ]
Brian's tender introduction to
the theatrical underworld...

would leave
a dramatic impression.

â™ª A wop, bop-a-loo-bop

â™ª Tutti frutti

So what are ya?
A mod or a rocker?

I'm six of one, half a dozen
of the other, really.

[ Man Narrating ]
Taking their cue
from Little Richard,

the swank London modsâ€”
short for modernists-

were the first to wear mascara
and lacquer their hair,

the first true dandies of pop,

and known to just about
any indiscretion...

where a good suit
was involved.

â™ª Try if you might
No one's in sight â™ª

â™ª And we got so much to share â™ª

â™ª Talking's fine
if you got the time â™ª

â™ª I ain't got the time to spare â™ª
All right, lads?

â™ª Do you wanna touch â™ª
â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Do you wanna touch me there,
yeah â™ª

â™ª Do you wanna touch â™ª
â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Do you wanna touch me there,
where â™ª

â™ª There, yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]
[ Man Narrating ]
Style...

always wins out
in the end.

â™ªâ™ª [ Vocalizing ]
â™ªâ™ª [ Soul ]

â™ª Don't you know that
I'd waitâ€” â™ª

[ Together ]
Cheers!

[ Man Narrating ]
For Brian, the mods were
a glamorous call to arms.

Or at least to London,
where three years later at
the Sombrero Club in Kensington,

I would hear him sing
for the very first time.

â™ªâ™ª [ Ends ]
[ Applauding ]

Everything, it seemed,
started at the Sombrero.

No club in London had
a more notorious sway.

And there
in the center of it...

was Brian's
American wife, Mandy,

whose dramatic transformation
to London party girl...

was a constant source
of amusement to us all.

You all know meâ€”
subtlety's my middle name.

It's as subtle as
the piece of skin between
my vagina and my anus.

Ooh, la-la.
[ Laughter ]

What's that called?
Does anyone remember
what that's called?

I don't think
I quite remember.

No man's land.
Oh, gosh. My geesh, darling!

Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

and whomever else may be
in the house this evening,

it is my supreme pleasure
to introduce...

all you lovely little
minskies here tonight...

to the Sombrero Club's
prettiest star...

and my most
shimmering hubby.
Shoosh!

I give you Brian Slade!

â™ª Oh, I was moved
by your screen dream â™ª

â™ª Celluloid pictures living â™ª

â™ª Your death could not kill
my love for you â™ª

â™ª Take two people romancing â™ª

â™ª Smoky nightclub situation â™ª

â™ª Your cigarette traces a ladderâ™ª

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª Celebrate years â™ª

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª Wipe away tears â™ª

â™ª Long time â™ª

â™ª Since we're together â™ª

â™ª Now I hope it's forever â™ª

Who is he?
Some scrubber, my dear.
I assure you.

But not that scruffy,
as I last recall.
Oh, you're wicked!

[ Laughing ]

She won't be back tonight.
Mmm.

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]

[ Narrating ]
So, I introduced myself,
told him I was developing...

my own management company
and on the lookout
for new talent.

He introduced me to his wife,
asked me what sign I was,

and before the week was out
we were signing contracts.

You see, Brian
believed in the future.

He despised the hypocrisy of
the peace and love generation...

and felt his music spoke far more
to its orphans and its outcasts.

His revolution,
he used to say,
will be a sexual one.

But in 1 970, rock audiences
bred on Credence Clearwater
and the Beatles...

were not entirely sure
what to make of this
particular brand of revolt.

â™ª Radiate simply â™ª

â™ª The candle is burning
so low for me â™ª

[ Indistinct Shouting ]

â™ª Generate me limply â™ª

Somehow he got it into his head
that he had to perform
in a frock.

Don't ask me why.
I mean, I thought
it was a bit naughty.

A bit of a giggle,
but, uhâ€”

â™ª Somebody call me Sebastian â™ª

â™ª Somebody call me Sebastian â™ª
Hey, who is this geezer then?

Some shirt-lifter
from Birmingham.
Mmm.

â™ª Work out a rhyme â™ª

â™ª Toss me the time â™ª

â™ª Lay me your mind â™ª

â™ª And we all know â™ª

[ Man ]
Get the fuck off!

Cut the shite!

Bugger off,
you woofter!

Fuck off!

â™ª Your Persian eyes sparkle
Your lips, ruby blue â™ªâ™ª

Darling?
Darling, you were fabulous.
[ Microphone Feeding Back ]

Every bit. I was beaming, truly,
like someone's mum.
Well done, Brian.

And they- they adored you.

The whole lot transported.
Transported?

We went down like
a fuckin' knackered lift!

Brian, I tell you,
I think it's simply
a matter of presentation,

and with
the proper backupâ€”
Backup?

What happened to Judy Garland?
What happened to all your
bloody torch song rubbish?

I know, I know,
in a cab ride.

But in the context of
a rock show, I see now
it's a bit more dodgy.

But the act was there,
wasn't it?
Absolutely.

[ Man On P.A. ]
Next up, all the way
from New York City,

lead singer and founder
of the greatest garage band
known to mankind,

â™ª She don't care â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I do mean you â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I do mean you â™ª

â™ª She got a TV eye on me â™ª

â™ª She got TV eye â™ª

â™ª She got a TV eye on me â™ª

[ Man Narrating ]
Curt Wild,

founder of the influential
garage band The Rats,

came from the aluminum
trailer parks of Michigan,

though rock folklore claims
far more primitive origins.

â™ª She got a TV eye on me â™ª

â™ª She don't care â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I love her so â™ª

â™ª Well, I love her so â™ª

â™ª She got a TV eye on me â™ª
Wanker! Wanker!

â™ª She got TV eye â™ª

â™ª She got a TV eye on me â™ª

According to legend,
when Curt was 1 3...

he was discovered by his mother
in the family loo...

at the service
of his older brother...

and promptly shipped off
for 1 8 months of electric shock treatment.

[ Audience Screaming,
Shouting ]

[ Alarm Buzzes ]
The doctors guaranteed
the treatment...

would fry the fairy
clean out of him.

But all it did
was make him bonkers...

every time he heard
electric guitar.

[ Electrical Whirring ]

[ Electrical Crackling ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Ends ]

They despised him.

Yeah.

But when you're abused
like that,

you know
you've touched the stars.

I know. I justâ€”

I just wish it'd been me.

I wish I thought of it.

You will, love. You will.

[ Brian ]
Thanks.

Devine.Jerry Devine,
personal management.
I'm interested.

Oh, thank you,
but I already have management.

He's, uhâ€”
Not in my opinion.

The truth is, you have talent.

That's obvious.

But it doesn't really
matter much what a man
does with his life.

What matters is the legend
that grows up around him.

Today, you're a talented singer.

That's all right.

I can make you a star.

And just how do you
propose to do that?

I will tell you, sir,

when you pin me.

[ Laughing, Muttering ]

May the best man win.

â™ª We'll take the whole shebang â™ª

[ Male Announcer]
Earlier tonight on the popular
chart show Top of the Pops,

newcomer Brian Slade
performed his hit single
"The Whole Shebang"...

dressed in platform boots
and wearing glitter eye makeup.

A spokesman for the show,
known for showcasing
pop's brightest stars,

says they've been deluged
with calls all evening.

[ Man Narrating ]
The next day,
every schoolgirl in London...

was wearing
glitter eye makeup,

and I was out
of a bleeding job.

And that, as they say,
was that.

I would not hear
another word from Brianâ€”

or any of them, for that matter-

ever again.

Have you got any, uh,
idea what ultimately
happened to him?

I mean, where he is today?

Last I'd heard
he'd returned to Birmingham,

but this was... three years ago?

Four?

No, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I can't
help you there.

Looks as though
it may be unavoidable.
What's that?

The ex, I'm afraid.

But then every story
needs a contrary opinion,

and with Mandy
you're guaranteed...

excesses of both.

[ Thunderclap ]

Miss Slade?

Yeah?
I'm Arthur Stuart.

From the Herald.
We spoke on the phone.

Um, anyway,
Iâ€™ve just got, you know,
a few questions I want to ask.

It shouldn't take long.
Do you mind if I sit down?

It's a free country-
sort of.

So what are you having?

Scotch.
[ Clears Throat ]
Rocks.

Make that two.

Gee, you must be after some
damn exclusive copy.

Well, it's a piece
on, um, Brian Slade.

What, sort of a memory jog
kind of thing?

Yeah. You know, it's been, um,

ten years since the whole
fake shooting incident.
[ Groans ]

And what a fake it was!
Tricking us all in the end
with such an authentic demise.

His career, you mean?

[ Chuckles ]

I mean, you know,
have you got any idea
what happened to him...

or where he is today?

Can't you just
run him through the files
and punch in the name?

No, not exactly.

Because honestly, darling,

I haven't spoken
with Mr. Slade in...

seven years, at least.

Seven years. Wow.

Wow. Yeah.

At least. Smoke?

No thanks.
No, right after
everything crashed,

we, uhâ€” we split.

And Brian, he justâ€”

became someone else.

Then again, he always was.

[ Man Laughing ]

That's ten bob to you, mate.

[ Laughing, Chattering ]
â™ªâ™ª [ Soul ]

[ Mandy Narrating ]
It was new yearâ€™s eve, 1 969â€”
the start of a new decade.

And everywhere you went,
there was this sense
of the future,

the feeling in the air
that anything was possible.

â™ªâ™ª [ Glam-rock ]
Oh, my favorite song!

â™ªâ™ª [ Fades ]

[ Mandy Narrating ]
See,Jack Fairy had also come
to London in the swinging '60s.

And in crowded clubs or hotel bars,

this shipwreck
of the streets...

rehearsed his future glory.

A cigarette tracing a ladder
to the stars.

Maricon.
Epicene.

Sexe douteux.

Le vice anglais.

[ Mandy Narrating ]
I needn't mention
how essential dreaming is...

to the character
of the rock star.

â™ªâ™ª [ Resumes ]
[ Screams ]
Jack, darling!

Jack was truly
the first of his kind.

A true original.

Everybody stole from Jack.

But from the moment Brian Slade
stepped into our lives,

nothing would ever be
the same.

It was his nature.

â™ª You got me, girl
on the runaround, runaround â™ª

â™ª Got me all around town â™ª

â™ª You got me, girl
on the runaround â™ª

â™ª And it's getting me down â™ª

â™ª Getting me down â™ª

â™ª Lady, if you want
to find a loverâ™ª

â™ª Then you look no furtherâ™ª

â™ª 'Cause I'm gonna be your only â™ª

â™ª Searchin' â™ª

â™ª At the start of the season â™ª

â™ª And my only reason â™ª

â™ª Is that I'll get you â™ª

Do you jive?

â™ª The sun will show â™ª

â™ª We're a connection â™ª

â™ª Hiding my intentions â™ª

â™ª Then I'll move up
close to you â™ª

â™ª I'll use you â™ª

â™ª And I'll confuse you â™ª

â™ª And then I'll hold you â™ª

â™ª Still you won't suspect me â™ª

[ Mandy ]
So I married him.

â™ªâ™ª [ Fades ]

â™ª I was dancing
when I was 1 2 â™ª

[ Mandy ]
Time-

â™ª I was dancing
since I was 1 2 â™ª
places, people-

â™ª I was dancing
when I was 1 2 â™ª

they're all speeding up.

â™ª I danced myself
right out the womb â™ª

So to cope with this
evolutionary paranoia,

â™ª I danced myself
right out the womb â™ª

strange people are chosen...
â™ª Is it strange to dance so soon â™ª

who through their art...

â™ª I danced myself
right out the womb â™ª

can move progress
more quickly.

[ Mandy Narrating ]
It was the most stimulating
and reflective period...

of our marriage.

â™ª I was dancing
when I was eight â™ª

â™ª Is it strange to dance so late â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Fades ]

[ Male Announcer]
Thank you and welcome, pop pickers,
to Pick of the Pops.

I'm Davy Rocket, and we have
a very special show
for you today,

dedicated to one of pop's
blazing new talents...

and one who's been holding
a virtual reign over
the British charts...

for a startling, record-breaking
eighteen-month span.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the incomparable Brian Slade!

Or should I say,
Maxwell Demon!

[ All Shouting, Overlapping ]

[ Devine ]
The bloke at the front.
Brian, why the makeup?

Why?
Because rock and roll
is a prostitute.

It should be tarted up,
performed.

The music is the mask,
while I, in my chiffon and taff-

Well, varda the message.

[ Reporters Shouting, Overlapping ]

The bloke in the suit.

What about your fans?
Aren't they likely to get
the wrong impression?

[ Slade ]
And which wrong impression is that?

[ Reporter]
Well, that you're
a blinking fruit.

[ Laughter ]
Well, thank you, sir.

And, no, it doesn't concern me in the least.

I should think that
if people were to get
the wrong impression of me,

the one to which you
so eloquently refer,

it wouldn't be the wrong
impression in the slightest.

That's me!
That's me, Dad!
That's me!

I mean, everybody knows
most people are bisexual.
Any more questions?

[ Woman ]
I was-
Yeah, woman with the beret.

I was under the impression
that you were married
and living in north London.

I am married.
Quite happily, in fact.

I just happen to like boys
as much as I like girls.

And seeing as my wife
feels pretty much the same
about such things,

I should think we've been able
to make a fairly decent go
of it so far.

[ Devine ]
All right.
Any more questions?

Okay, thank you very much.

[ Mandy Narrating ]
For the first time
in Brian's life,

he was simply
telling it like it was.

Did he realize
what he'd actually done?

How could he have?
I mean, today there'd be
fighting in the streets.

But in 1 972,

it was more like dancing.

â™ª Make me a deal
and make it straight â™ª

â™ª Signed and sealed
I'll take it â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]

[ Laughing, Chattering ]

That man sitting over there
in the white suit...

is the biggest thing
to come out of this country
since sliced Beatles.

Outside this country,

no one knows
who the hell he is.

You people, you're gonna
change all that.

You guys, you're the actors.

It's up to you to change
Brian Slade, pop singer,

into Maxwell Demon,
space-age fuckin' superstar.

Nothing fantastic about it.

Why?

Because the secret
of becoming a star...

is knowing how
to behave like one.

Hey, kids,
let's put on a show!

Precisely.

Action!
[ Film Slate Clicks ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]

[ Motor Revving ]

Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

[ Shouting, Indistinct ]

I know it's unprecedented.
I know it's unorthodox.

But, sir,
if you want Brian Slade,
those are the terms.

You may take them
or leave them.

Yes?
I'm Shannon Hazelbourne.

Who?
I rang up about the position.

The what?
Um, assistant clerical aid.

Oh, the position.
Right. Brilliant. Follow me.

[ Mandy ]
Crash! Zounds!
Now, Shannon.

I realize, of course,
your talents lie within
the clerical arts,

but I was wondering, per chance,

if you had any experience
of wardrobe?

Um, no, never.
Fantastic!

I think that's everything.
No, I said I didn't.

Everybody, I'd like
to introduce you...

to our lovely new
wardrobe mistress.

Umâ€”

Shannon.
Shannon!

[ All Chattering ]

Excellent.
Yes, Mr. Weinberg.

Thank you very much indeed, sir.

Cheers.
[ Replaces Receiver ]

Extraordinary.

[ Mandy ]
What,Jerry?

What?
So tell me, Master Demon.

Who would you
most fancy meeting...

in America?
[ Excited Chattering ]

[ Mandy ]
Oh, Garbo, Brian. Please!

Brando for me.
Einstein.

Very sorry, chickee.
He's dead.
Jerry said anyone.

Brian! Who?

Curt Wild.

I want to meet Curt Wild.

[ Mandy ]
And meet Curt Wild we did.

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª No, no, no, no
no, no, no, no â™ª

â™ª Well, we can't take it
this week â™ª

â™ª And her friends
don't want another speech â™ª

â™ª Hopin' for a better day â™ª

â™ª To hear what she's gonna say â™ª

â™ª All about that personality crisis â™ª

â™ª You got it
while it was hot â™ª

â™ª But now frustration
and heartache â™ª

â™ª Is what you got â™ª

â™ª That's why they talk about
personality â™ª

â™ª But now you're tryin' to be some
and now you're gonna do some â™ª

â™ª You wanna be someone
with cow-wow-wows â™ª

[ Man ]
Mr. Wild.
Yeah?

I'm Rodney from Electra.

I have Brian Slade here
from England.Just wanted
to pop over, say hello.

I just wanted to say, I think
your music is tops, really.

Smashing. Best of the lot.

Smashing.

Top hole.

Jolly f-

[ Mutters ]

[ Giggling ]

Sorry, darling.

[ Mandy ]
Now at that time,
Curt Wild was between management,

and Brian knew this, of course,
and urged Devine to pursue the situation.

[Jerry ]
And so if, in that probability,

an interest arose...

in which Brian would serve
on some projects,

possibly,
though not exclusively, asâ€”

We're takin' our lead
from you here, Curt.

Possibly as a producer
on that project,

how might that scenario,
purely hypothetically-

how might that scenario
appeal to you at this juncture?

Well, I-Iâ€”
What Jerryâ€™s
tryin' to say is,

do you want to come
to London to cut a record?

Oh, yeah. Cool.

Very good.

But-But how can
we help you?

You must tell us.
What do you need?

Everything.

See, heroin was my main man.

Yeah, but now
I'm on the methadone...

and I'm getting my act together,
and you come here and say...

you wanna help,

and I say, "Hey, far out."

You could be my main man.

[ Mandy ]
It was pretty clear
what was happening.

Happens every day.

But for the world
to think it was happening, well,

that was Jerryâ€™s
particular genius.

[ Crowd Cheering ]

Right away he started
promoting the two of them...

like a pair of'40s starlets
on the swoonâ€”

Tracy and Hepburn
for the '70S.

â™ª Bum, bum, bum â™ª
â™ª Satellite of love â™ª

â™ª Satellite ofâ™ª

â™ª Satellite's gone
way up to Mars â™ª

â™ª Soon it'll be filled

â™ª I love to watch things on TV â™ª

â™ª Bum, bum, bum â™ª

â™ª If I could have grown â™ª

â™ª All up on my own â™ª

â™ª If I could have grown
I grew â™ª

â™ª If I could have grew
I do â™ª

â™ª If I had a throne â™ª

[ Little Girl's Voice ]
My career was on the skids, mate,

and you fished me
out of the muck.

You got me back
on my feet, you did.

It was nothing, chum.

I wanted to help you
make more of that far-out sound.

I love your music, my son,

and I love-

â™ª Hey, let's do it
like we're friends â™ª

You don't have to
say it, mate.

â™ª At last the crimson
chord cascade â™ª

â™ª To shower
dry cordials within â™ª

â™ª Too late to leap
the chocolate gate â™ª

â™ª Pale fountains
fizzing forth pink gin â™ª

â™ª Bum, bum, bum â™ª
â™ª While destiny
begins to fly â™ª

â™ª Bum, bum, bum â™ª
â™ª The farmyard chorus
sings its wake â™ª

â™ª Bum, bum, bum â™ª
â™ª Upstanding anthem
to the sky â™ª

â™ª Too soon to realize
their fate â™ª

[ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
Every great century
that produces art is,

so far, an artificial century.

And the work that seems
the most natural
and simple of its time...

is always the result of
the most self-conscious effort.

I'm not really myself,
except...

in the midst
of elegant crowds,

[ Shutter Clicks ]
at the heart of rich districts,

or amid the sumptuous
ornamentation of palace hotels,

an army of servants...

and plush carpet underfoot.

What's true about music
is true about life.
[ Shutter Clicks ]

That beauty reveals everything...

because it expresses nothing.

The first duty in life
is to assume a pose.

What the second duty is,

no one has yet found out.

[ Drum Roll ]

[ Applause ]

[ Soft Music ]

The aesthete gives
characteristically cynical evidence,

replete with pointed epigram
and startling paradox,

while explaining his views
on morality in art.

[ Men Shouting ]
Brian! Brian! Brian!

Maxwell Demon is the story
of a space creature who becomes
a rock and roll messiah,

only to be destroyed
by his own success.

Are you saying
this is your destiny?

Are you Maxwell Demon?

Man is least himself
when he talks in his own person.

Give him a mask
and he'll tell you the truth.

[ Laughter]

Is it your belief that
all dandies are homosexual?

Ha!

Nothing makes one so vain
as being told one is a sinner.

[ Laughing ]

Hey! Comin' through!
Comin' through!

Hey, guys, watch out.
Excuse me.

Comin' through. Careful now.
There you go.

Tell us, Brian.
Are the rumors true when
they say you and Curt Wild...

have some sort of plans
up your sleeve?

Oh, yes.

Quite soon we actually plan
to take over the world.

[ Laughter, Applause ]

[ Laughter Continues ]

Excuse me, fellas,

while I raise a glass to
the loveliest man in Europe.

[ Audience ]
Ooh!

And they tell you
it's not natural.

[ Audience Laughing ]

[ Laughter Continues ]

The world is changed
'cause you are made
of ivory and gold.

The curves of your lips
rewrite history.

[ Camera Shutters Clicking ]

â™ª Baby's on fire â™ª

â™ª Better throw her in the waterâ™ª

â™ª Look at her laughing â™ª

â™ª Like a heifer to the slaughterâ™ª

â™ª Baby's on fire â™ª

â™ª And all the laughing boys

â™ª Waiting for photos â™ª

â™ª Oh, the plot is so bewitching â™ª

[ Audience Cheering ]

â™ª Rescuers row, row â™ª

â™ª Do your best

â™ª They said you were
hot stuffâ™ª

â™ª And that's what
baby's been reduced to â™ª

[ Audience Cheering Wildly ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Loud Rock Continues ]

That's it!
Jim, what are you
gonna do?

[ Woman ]
Jim!

[ Laughs ]
Thank God! A woman!

[ Pounding ]

[Jim ]
Could you conceivably turn down
that blastedâ€” Arthur!

Arthur, open this door!
[ Glass Breaking ]

You bring shame
to this house.

You bring shame
to your mother and me.

It's a shameful,
filthy thing you're doing.

Do you hear me?

Stand up!

It's funny how beautiful
people look when they're
walking out the door.

[ Mandy ]
Really, Shannon,
it's no problem. Honestly.

I mean, I'm not frustrated.
I'm kind of open about it.

I was having a fabulous
time last night myself.

[ Shannon Sniffling ]

[ Mandy ]
Really, love.

You shouldn't let it
upset you so.

Brian's a grown man...

and fully capable of shagging
whatever he fancies,

and exceedingly partial
to the practice.

[ Mandy ]
Now,just because someone sees,

you know, two naked people
asleep in bed together,

it doesn't necessarily prove
sex was involved.

[ Door Closes ]
It does, however,

make for
a very strong case.

But you're a sweet,
sensitive darling...

to be so broken up about it.

Brian would be absolutely chafed
to know that you feel this way.

Don't you dare
tell Brian!
Ow!

Swear to me you'll
never say a word, ever.

[ Scoffs ]
I swear.

Jesus!

[ Elevator Bell Dings,
Door Closes ]

[ Mandy ]
"A sudden change in plans.

"A brief holidayâ€”
much needed.

"Back by Hammersmith.

B."

That was it.

Look, I'm sorry.

I wish I could help you more.
You seem like a nice guy.

I just, uhâ€”
[ Glass Clinks ]

Don't think I have
what you're looking for.

See, I think you do, actually.

Oh, yeah?

And what makes you
think so?

Well, that smile, for one thing.

Well, smiles lie.

Exactly.

Listen.

Once, of course,

there was a gorgeous,
gorgeous time.

We were all...

living our dreams.

You see, all that went away.

All of it.

With Curt.

And not even
the real Curt.

I mean, it was the idea of Curt,
more than anything.

This, uh, thisâ€”
[ Clears Throat ]

Image, which, of course,

nobody could ever
possibly live up to.

I mean, Maxwell Demon,
Curt Wild.
They were fictions!

â™ª Won't you come with me â™ª

[ Mandy ]
Somewhere along the way,

Brian seemed to get
lost in the lie.

â™ª Come and take my hand â™ª

â™ª And we'll find a thrill â™ª

â™ª Can't you see â™ª

â™ª I wanna tear it down â™ª

â™ª Come with me â™ª

â™ª I wanna â™ª

â™ª Kick it all around â™ª
Shit!

Cut it.
Should I stop it?

â™ª Tell me what you need â™ª

â™ª I wanna be your unclean â™ª

â™ª And I'll be your dream â™ª

He's gonna hit the bridge
a half verse early.

Now you're simply wasting tape.
All right, cut it.

[ Music Stops ]
â™ª And I'll setâ€” â™ª

What? What?
Is there a problem?

[ No Audio ]

Again.
What? What?

[Jerry ]
I'm sorry, Curt. It appears-
What?

Curt, we only ask that when
you decide to make a change,

you simply inform us in advance
so Eton here is properly prepared.

Otherwiseâ€”
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, man.

I didn't make
any fuckin' change.

Brian.

Fuckin' motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

You're a motherfucker!
Fuck you!

Fuck you, Motherfucker!
Fuck you!
[ Glass Shattering ]

Fuck!
Eton. Eton, please.

[ Microphone Cuts Off]

[Jerry ]
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this,

but what started off as
an interesting experiment
has quite frankly...

descended into a demeaning waste
of your time and mine.

I mean, you've already spent
40 hours studio timeâ€”
Thirty-six.

Whatever. Thirty-six hours
studio time on two,

three bloody cuts?

Brian, you seem to forget,
you're a very big star now,

and I think your time is worth
a great deal more than this.
[ Microphone On ]

...Space queen on your
fuckin' high horse,
and all your fuckin' henchmen!

Fuck you!

[ Slamming Furniture ]

Perhaps it's time for another
little break, eh, fellas?

Give us a stretch?

[ Man ]
Mate.
Jerry?

I can't risk extending
his contract, Brian.

I think it's quite clear why.

Talk to you tomorrow.

[ Door Slams ]

Piss off! Go on, then!

Back to your wolves!
Your junkie twerps!
Your bloody shock treatment!

And fuck you too!

â™ªâ™ª [ "Bitter Sweet" Begins ]

â™ª Well, this â™ª

â™ª Is such a sad affairâ™ª

â™ª I've opened up my heart â™ª

â™ª Oh, so many times â™ª

â™ª But now it's closed â™ª

Out.
"O-U-T."

Well, Brian, I'm afraid that is
completely out of the question.

You are contractually bound...

to finish the Maxwell Demon tour
as Maxwell Demon.

Jerry, I'm tellin' you,
it's gettin' too far out of hand.

Brian, Brian,
I realize you're
under tremendous strain,

but youâ€™ve just gotta
hang on in there
and finish the bloody tour.

You hang on in there.
I'll hang on here, right?

And then you can do
what you want, okay?

[ Man Speaking German ]

â™ª Every salty tear â™ª

[ German Continues ]

[ Siren Blaring ]

[ Car Horns Honking ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Loud Rock ]

â™ª But when the show's
in full swing â™ª

â™ª Every once in a while â™ª

â™ª High-stepping chorus lines

â™ª Mein lullaby, Liebchen â™ª

â™ª Liebchen â™ª

[ Shouting ]

â™ª How rich in contrast â™ª

â™ª Love can be â™ª

â™ª Sometimes I'm quite amused â™ª

â™ª To see it twist and turn â™ª

â™ª To taste â™ª

â™ª Both sweet and dry â™ª

â™ª These vintage years â™ª

â™ª Lovers you consume

â™ª As others â™ª

â™ª Their wine â™ª

â™ª Nein â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues, In German ]

I don't believe that there is
much of a future to speak of.

We're in a bit of
a decadent spiral, aren't we?

Sinking fast.

Big brother, baby,
all the way.

Which is why we prefer
impressions to ideas.
Situations to subjects.

Brief lights to sustained ones.

Exceptions to types.
And yourself?

Well,

I'm-I'm just lookin' for
a room at the moment.

â™ª And now â™ª

â™ª As you turn to leave â™ª

â™ª You try to force a smile â™ª

â™ª As if to compensate â™ª

â™ª Then you break down â™ª

â™ª And cry â™ªâ™ª

[ Mandy ]
So for one entire day,

I actually believe
Brian's been shot,

that the whole thing is real,

all his paranoia
has proven horribly true.

You mean,
no one told you?
Nope.

Why?
Forgot.

Jesus.

I mean, I knew it was over.

I just...

didn't know it was up to me
to make it stop.

[ Sniffing ]

Mandy.

Hello, Brian.

[ Whispering ]
No, thanks.

These are the papers.

[ Clears Throat ]
I, uh, believe they're in order.

All you need to do is sign.

[ Sniffles ]

So you won't forget.

I already have.
Evidently.

Fuck you, Brian!

Did you ever,
for one bloody second in your life,

want anything more than this?

No.

Your problem...

is you get what you want
and do what you will.

Worlds, Mandy,
are built out of suffering.

There's suffering
at the birth of a child
as at the birth of a star.

You live in terror
of not being misunderstood.

Women defend themselves
by attacking,

just as they attack
by sudden and strange
surrenders.

I lost my girlhood, true.

But it was for you.

[ Door Opens, Closes ]

What in God's name is going on up here?
How the fuck did you get in here?

Brian, I am really sorry
about that.

That's all right, Shannon.
Mandy was just leaving.

Mandy, if you'd be so kind
as to follow me-

Let go of me!
I am perfectly capable
of making my ownâ€”

[ Brian Giggling ]

I really don't want to
have to call someone.

Call someone?

[ Giggling Continues ]

I am his wife, for fuck's sake!

[ Giggling Continues ]

Fuck the lot of you!

[ Arthur]
Was that the last time you saw him?

[ Mandy ]
No.

I saw him again,

briefly, a few weeks later
at a concert.

He was performin'?

[ Laughs ]
No.

Curt was actually performing.
[ Coins Drop In Machine ]

He and Jack Fairy had just
finished their Berlin record...

and Curt was in London
playin' some gigs,
and Brian was there.

For a second.
I don't think anyone even saw him.

Which concert?

Uh, it was like a tribute,
a sort of...

farewell concert to glam rock.

To save your wild, wild lives,

to neâ€™er your fans embitter,

to cease your sad demise,

tonight we toastâ€”

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good â™ª

â™ª Everybody says
it's just like Robin hood â™ª

â™ª I move like a rat
talk like a cat â™ª

â™ª Sting like a bee â™ª

â™ª Babe, I'm gonna be your man â™ª

â™ª And it's plain to see
you were meant for me â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I'm your toy
your 20th century boy â™ª

[ Indistinct Chattering ]

Is this working?
Because I want it blue-er.

I don't think you should bother.
I think I should go on stage
tonight instead of you.

Arthur, come on.
Give me a hand with this.

Come on. Come on.

I'm stuck.

Stop moving about, dude.
My eyeliner.
[ Chattering ]

I'm trapped!
I'm being attacked by a bloody porno!

â™ª And it's plain to see
you were meant for me â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I'm your boy
Your 20th century toy â™ª

â™ª 20th century boy â™ª

â™ª I wanna be your toy â™ª

â™ª 20th century boy â™ª

â™ª Oh, cheeky cheeky â™ª

â™ª Oh, naughty sneaky â™ª

â™ª You're so deceptive â™ª

â™ª And I wonder how you knew â™ª

â™ª But this page
don't walk too well â™ª

[ Beeping ]

[ Broadcast Continues ]

[ Man ]
What is your reaction
to the tour so far?

[ Shannon ]
The tour's been
a tremendous success.

Um, and due to
the overwhelming demand,

there will be additional
shows added...

whenever and wherever possible.

Regrettably, Mr. Stone only
has time for a few brief
questions this morning,

as he has a plane
to catch to Zurich.

[ Reporters Shouting ]
Tommy! Tommy!

â™ª You were always
so charming â™ª

â™ª As you paid
your way out there â™ª

Lou.

Lou!

Lou! Lou! Lou!

Sorry, Arthur.
I'm late.
I think I'm on to something.

What?
Something quite big.
I think I know who Brian Slade is.

Aw, that story's been dropped.
What?

Why?
I need you on
the Stone show.

But that's it!

What did they say to ya?

Lou!

Hi. Yeah, um,
my name's Arthur Stuart,

from the Herald.

Um, I was, uhâ€”
I was given this number.

Uh, I was told I could reach
Curt Wild, uh, here.

[ Curt ]
Listen.
Yeah?

Hello? Hello?
What am I
supposed to say?

Listen. I don't know
who the hell gave
you this number,

but Curt Wild
is not available
and not interested...

in granting you
or anyone else an interview
on this subject.

You got it?
I'm sorry.
I was- I was toldâ€”

â™ª Oh, give me danger
little strangerâ™ª

â™ª And I'll feel you bleed â™ª

â™ª Oh, give me danger
little strangerâ™ª

â™ª And I'll heal
your disease â™ª

â™ª There's nothin' in my veins â™ª

â™ª But some ugly memory â™ª

â™ª Kiss me like
the ocean breeze â™ª

[ Cheering ]

â™ª Well, if you will be my loverâ™ª

â™ª I will shield you from tears â™ª

â™ª But if you will be
my master â™ª

â™ª Then I will do anything â™ª

â™ª There's nothin' left alive
but some â™ª

â™ª Dark glassy eyes â™ª

â™ª Erase my feelings
one more time â™ª

[ Cheering ]

â™ª Hey, come on, gimme dangerâ™ª

â™ª Die, little strangerâ™ª

â™ª Swear youâ€™re gonna feel me â™ª

â™ª Come on, little stranger
Die a little laterâ™ª

â™ª Swear youâ€™re gonna feel me â™ª

â™ª Swear youâ€™re gonna
feel me â™ª

[ Wild Cheering ]

â™ª Gimme dangerâ™ª

â™ª Little strangerâ™ª

â™ª Gimme dangerâ™ª

â™ª Little strangerâ™ª

â™ª Oh, gimme dangerâ™ª

â™ª Every day â™ª

â™ª Can you feel it â™ª

â™ª I got a feelin' â™ª

â™ª I got a feelin', got a feelin' â™ª

I got a feelin' â™ª

â™ª I wanna feel it â™ª

â™ª Oh, I wanna feel it â™ª

â™ª I wanna fuckin' feel it â™ª

â™ª I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it â™ª

â™ª Feel it, feel it, feel it â™ªâ™ª

[ Wild Cheering ]

[ Cheering Continues ]

[ Crying ]
That was really beautiful.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Thanks.

Did you see, uhâ€”

No, I didn't see him.
[ Sniffles ]

[ Arthur: Voice-Over ]
It's only now, lookin' back,

that I see how you
patched through my walls...

and entered my life...

in waves.

[ Curt ]
Come closer.

Don't be frightened.

What's your name?
Favorite color?

Song? Movie?

Don't be nervous.
Are you high?

I'm on a button.

[ Arthur: Voice-Over]
He was waitin' for me.

I'd followed his signals
and slipped away.

And now, suddenlyâ€”

[ Laughing ]

Hey.

Make a wish.

Hey.

â™ªâ™ª [ "Tumbling Down" Begins ]

Make a wish...

and see yourself...

on stage, inside out,

tangle of garlands in your hair.

Of course you are
pleasantly surprised.

[ Arthur: Voice-Over ]
Softly, he saidâ€”

[ Mixed Voices: Voice-Over ]
I will mangle your mind.

â™ª Like a peppermint eaten away â™ª

â™ª Will I fight
Will I swagger or sway â™ª

â™ª Hee-hee, milady â™ª

â™ª She cries like a baby â™ª

â™ª To scold us â™ª

â™ª See her tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Down, tumbling down â™ª

â™ª See her tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Hail to the monkey â™ª

â™ª We're having a funky reunion â™ª

â™ª Wasted and sunk â™ª

â™ª He can only have
Sunday communion â™ª

â™ª He's got nicotine stains in his eyes â™ª

â™ª He's got nothing to protect
but his pride â™ª

â™ª Oh, smother a kiss â™ª

â™ª Or be drowned
in blissful confusion â™ª

â™ª See her tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Down, tumbling down â™ª

â™ª See her tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Tumbling down â™ª

â™ª See her tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Down, tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Tumbling down â™ª

â™ª Tumbling down â™ªâ™ª

[ Song Ends, Crowd Cheers ]

[ Woman ]
Tommy! Whoo-hoo! Tommy!

[ Shouting ]
â™ª Oh, cheeky, cheeky â™ª

â™ª Oh, naughty, sneaky â™ª

[ Shouting ]

[ Cheering ]

[ Man ]
Tommy, where did you get the idea
for such a spectacular stadium show?

[ Tommy ] Tell you the truth?
It's a bloody pain in the ass.
[ Laughter ]

The whole thing takes
six full-size rigs or three
chartered planes to transport.

What can I say? I think big.
[ Cheering ]

Tommy, over here.
Tommy, what's your opinion of the work...

that President Reynolds
has been doing?

[ Tommy ] Excellent. Excellent
I think he's doing brilliant work.

He's a, uh,
tremendous leader, a, uh,

tremendous spokesperson
for the needs
of the nation today.

Tommy, what's your response
to the recent allegations...

connectin' you with bisexual
pop singer Brian Slade,

who staged his own assassination
ten years ago in London?

Ladies and gentlemen,
that's all that Mr. Stone
has time for this evening.

Thank you very much.
[ Disappointed Shouting ]

Get out!
Get out!
Now! Out!

[ Man On TV ]
Stone is promoting his
Grammy-winning release,

"People Rocking People,"
to sold-out arenas worldwide.

â™ªâ™ª [ Song Continues ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Song Continues On Jukebox ]

Beer, please.

[ Glasses Clinking ]

Excuse me, sir.

Are you with
the Tommy Stone tour?

[ Snickering ]

No.Just a journalist.

Perhaps you'd like my, uh,

press pass as a souvenir.

Thanks, sir.

[ Screeches ]
[ Girls Shouting ]

You're Curt Wild.

Yeah. Who the hell are you?

I'm a journalist
from the Herald.

You were
at the concert?

Itâ€™s just funny, 'cause, uh,

I was tryin' to contact you,
actually,

about a story
I was doin' about
an old friend of yours.

Brian Slade.

I was tryin' to find out
what actually happened to him.
Look-

I mean, before he became...

such a mystery.

Look, man, I don't know
who you've been talkin' to
or what you're after here, butâ€”

What?

What?
Listen.

A real artist creates beautiful
things, and puts nothing of
his own life into them, okay?

Is that what you did?
No.

We set out
to change the world.

Ended up just
changin' ourselves.

What's wrong with that?

Nothing.

If you don't
look at the world.

[ Curt ]
Well, I guess in the end
he got what he wanted.

[ Chair Moves ]

That's quite a pin you got there.

Oh, yeah.

Is it old?
Possibly.

Belonged to Oscar Wilde.

Or so I was told
by the person that gave it to me.

Friend of mine...

who kinda disappeared
some years back.

I forget where we were.
We were on a trip.

But he said to me, "Curt,

a man's life is his image."

Here. Why don't you
hang on to it.

Me?

Sure. Why not?

I've had it too long, anyway.

Go ahead.

For your image.

Really.

I couldn't.

But thanks.

â™ªâ™ª [ "2HB" Begins ]

[ Man ]
God, I love this song.

Anyway.
Yeah.

I'll, uh, see you around.

Cheers.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Arthur: Voice-Over ]
He called it a freedom.

A freedom
you can allow yourself.

Or not.

â™ª Oh, I was moved
by your screen dream â™ª

â™ª Celluloid pictures living â™ª

â™ª Your death could not kill
our love for you â™ª

â™ª Take two people romantic â™ª

â™ª Smoky nightclub situation â™ª

â™ª Your cigarette
traces a ladderâ™ª

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª Celebrate years â™ª

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª Wipe away tears â™ª

â™ª Long time since we're togetherâ™ª

â™ª Now I hope it's foreverâ™ª

[ Audience Cheering ]

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª Hard to forget â™ª

â™ª Here's looking at you, kid â™ª

â™ª At least not yet â™ª

â™ª Your memory stays â™ª

â™ª It lingers ever â™ª

â™ª Will fade away never â™ª

[ People Chattering, Laughing ]

â™ª Will fade away neverâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ "Make Me Smile" Begins ]

â™ª You've done it all â™ª

â™ª You've broken every code â™ª

â™ª And pulled the rebel
to the floorâ™ª

â™ª Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba â™ª

â™ª You spoiled the game â™ª

â™ª No matter what you say â™ª

â™ª For only metal â™ª

â™ª What a bore â™ª

â™ª Blue eyes, blue eyes â™ª

â™ª How can you tell so many lies â™ª

â™ª Come up and see me
make me smile â™ª

â™ª Or do what you want â™ª

â™ª Runnin' wild â™ª

â™ª There's nothing left â™ª

â™ª All gone and run away â™ª

â™ª Maybe you'll tarry for a while â™ª

â™ª Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba â™ª

â™ª It's just a test â™ª

â™ª A game for us to play â™ª

â™ª Win or lose, it's hard to smile â™ª

â™ª Resist, resist â™ª

â™ª It's from yourself
you have to hide â™ª

â™ª Oh, come up to see me
to make me smile â™ª

â™ª Or do what you want
runnin' wild â™ª

â™ª There ain't no more â™ª

â™ª You've taken everything â™ª

â™ª From my belief
in Mother Earth â™ª

â™ª Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba â™ª

â™ª Can you ignore â™ª

â™ª My faith in everything â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I know what faith is
and what it's worth â™ª

â™ª Away, away â™ª

â™ª And don't say
maybe you'll try â™ª

â™ª Oh, come up and see me
to make me smile â™ª

â™ª Or do what you want
just runnin' wild â™ª

â™ª Ooh-ooh
la-la-la â™ª

â™ª Come up and see me â™ª

â™ª Make me smile â™ª

â™ª Or do what you want â™ª

â™ª Runnin' wild â™ª

â™ª Ooh-ooh
la-la-la â™ª

â™ª Come up and see me
to make me smile â™ªâ™ª
