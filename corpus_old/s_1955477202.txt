Chloe.

This is Dr. Greenberg

and this is his wife Janice.

They're interested in your work.

What do you guys wanna know?

We've been told
that it's childish,

self-indulgent,
sophomoric.

I see. Well, maybe this
isn't a good time.

Honey, why don't we look
around a little more?

Sure, please do.
I'll be around.

Wow. Can you not do this
to me right now, please?

Why? Why did you put up
my stuff? It's not ready.

There's absolutely nobody here.

Chloe, it's early,
and the gallery...

I have put way too much time
and money into this thing

to just keep pushing it off.

You need to calm down and relax.

Calm down?
Yes.

Are you serious?
This is fucking embarrassing.

Okay, wow.
I can't do this right now

because I have to go
sell your work.

You know what?
We love this one.

I just love this piece...

[Chatter continues]

Um, actually, Chloe?

Do you mind telling the
Greenbergs about this piece?

your name and, uh, your age?

Toby.

Jonas.

I'm Alexia.
I'm 22.

20.
18.

I'm ageless, baby.





Chloe?

Chloe?

Chloe?

How'd you get here in life?

You know, girl.
Surgery isn't cheap.

Meth.

My ex-boyfriend.

Threesomes lead to group sex,

which lead to this, I guess.

The pimp picked me up
when I was in the park

right when I was aging
out of foster care, okay?

is adequate for...

Okay. Okay.
Um, this...

[man #2]
That's fine. That's fine.

Okay.

Chloe?

Okay. Well...

Walking out of rehab
did not help your case any.

I need you to read this
non-disclosure agreement

and sign it.

I regret to inform you
that the board feels

you can no longer uphold your
obligations to the charity.

You are relieved of all duties
and responsibilities,

effective immediately.

What is... what is this?

The board recognizes
that you were important

to the implementation
of the foundation,

but it can no longer be
associated with you.

There are others
that need to be considered...

The families, the researchers...

I'm not taking money
from my mother's foundation.

Please, Chloe.

Chloe, we want you to
concentrate on your life.

I'm sorry.

Could you please look at me?

Chloe, I'm doing
the best that I can.

I'm only trying to help.

This isn't what mom
would have wanted.

Yeah, well, maybe she shouldn't
have killed herself.

anything, what would you be?

Really?
Not me.

Oh, I don't know.

I haven't really
thought about it.

Oh, god,
if I could be anything...

I'd be in love.

â™ª

[Woman singing indistinctly]

Is something wrong?
Shh. Just don't move.

What... what are you doing?

I'm sorry.
My neck is killing me.

If you're not gonna take
any shots, you know,

is it okay if I just go
have a smoke?

Okay, well,
everything's just the same.

It's like... everything's just
the same.

You're just...

Do you have any other looks
or anything?

Me? You're the artist.

Let's try something.
If you come...

Try coming to the side, maybe?

Like, think of, like,
a strong pose.

Maybe a pulling one... something
like that.

Yeah, just kind of work
with the ribbons a little bit.

Whatever you feel
comfortable with.

[Sighs] -What's... what's...
what's going on?

I'm sorry, it just doesn't
seem like you're that into it.

If you want,
we can just reschedule.

Okay, let's...

This is not gonna work.

Let's try something
completely different, okay?

Just back up.

Let's try this.

Okay.

Sit down.

All right.
Let's see.

What's it like to be you?

Wait, are you recording this?

Because that's not
in our contract

and I'm half-naked.

It's just a piece

for this experimental
exhibit I'm doing.

Okay.

When did you get started?

16.

Where were you?

In New York.

that open, please?

Thank you. Yeah.

So, what's it like making money

using your body?

Wait, I've been...

I've been in Elle,
cosmo, and vogue.

I'm a high-fashion model,
not...

Not some whore.

So, if you want to shoot,
we can shoot.

One more question.

Do you like being desired
by men and women?

It is what it is.
It's a job.

You should smile more.

Fuck off.

What's it like
to never have to struggle?

Are you joking?

What the fuck do you even
know about struggling?

Freak.

What the fuck do you even
know about struggling?

Are you joking?
I'm not some whore.

What the fuck do you even
know about struggling?

that open, please?

know about... are you joking?

I'm not some whore.
What the fuck do you...

What the fuck do you
even know about...

I'm not some whore.

What the fuck do you
even know about struggling?

Are you joking?
I'm not some whore.

Are you joking?
I'm not some whore.

What the fuck do you even know
about... I'm not some whore.

What the fuck
do you even know about...

What's this for?

It's for this project I'm doing.

What's with the glass?

It's just to blur your face.

Oh.

You okay?
I'm okay.

Can I ask how old you are?

I'm 18.

How'd you get here?

My dad drove me here.

Your dad dropped you off here?

Yeah.
He's waiting outside.

Where... where's your mother?

Dead.

[Knock on door]

Who is that?
Oh, I don't know.

You're full of shit.
Who is that?

It's okay, I'll get the door.
It's fine.

What the fuck, lady?

Calm down, I didn't...
not cool, lady!

It's fine.
Wait, wait, wait.

Hey! Hey!

Um, I think I might be
in the wrong apartment.

I'm looking for apartment 119.

This is right. Come on. Kat, yeah?
Conrad sent you?

What's with the kid?

Um, nothing,
I'm doing interviews.

You're certainly
doing something.

Yeah, it'll just
be a few questions.

If, um... I'll pay you, okay?

How long will this take?

No more than 15 minutes.

If you could just answer a few
questions, and be honest, please.

Just be, like, brutally honest.

Brutally honest?

Uh, there's no smoking in here.

Okay, could you just say
your name, and your age,

and some basic stuff
to the camera, please,

kind of thing?
No.

Okay, well, I need
basic info from you.

No, you don't.

Okay, how did you get
into your field?

My field?
Prostitution.

Thank you.

A man paid me
to have sex with him.

What were the circumstances?

Circumstances were
he wanted to fuck me,

but I didn't want to fuck him,

so he gave me some money.

How long ago was this?

A while.

How old were you?

Younger.

Okay. Let's try
something else.

Is this...

Is this a life that you've
chosen to stick with

or do you want out?


Because the deal was
that I pay you

to tell me the truth.

No, the deal was
you wanted me to be honest.

Remember?
Yes.

Well, the truth is, you're
asking all the wrong questions.

Really?

When did I get started

and how long have
I been doing this?

Do I want out?
Who cares?

Do you like what you do?

I like being good at what I do.

When I'm with a client,
I'm exactly what they want.

Not what they say they want.

Not what they think they want.

I'm what they don't know
they want.

What do I want?

You want someone to come in here
and shit all over your world,

make you do things you really
want to do, but can't.

You said you wanted
brutal honesty

because you are looking
for someone

to come in here
and tell you things

you don't want to hear.

What don't I want to hear?

I believe you owe me money.

How much you charge?

As much as I can get.

Up to $3,000 a night.

I do whatever I need to.

Trade or steal, you know,
if I need a fix.

I'll charge a dick in the ass
if he's got it going on.

[Man moaning]

[Moaning continues]

[Man coughing, wheezing]

Hey, babe.

Get me a bottle of water
from the mini-bar.

[Man coughing]
Yeah, sure.


Oh, man.

Can I keep these?

If you want to play some more,
we have to renegotiate.

Babe, times are tight.

I can't even afford
our dates anymore.

I know you understand.

Sounds like you couldn't go
another round anyway, love.

You need to take
care of yourself

or you'll die
before your wife does.

Oh, man.

I can't believe a 45-year-old
prostitute is handing out advice.

[Continues coughing]

I'm 44.

My dad dropped me here.

Your dad dropped you off here?

He's waiting outside.

Where's your mother?

Dead.

[Woman echoing] I'm not
leaving you on purpose.

What the fuck, lady?

I didn't call...

Not cool, lady.
It's fine.

What's with the kid?

[Girl] Not cool, lady!
[Chloe] It's fine.

Where do you want me?

The key to this job is control.

Show up early
before the client's ready

and it keeps you
in charge of the situation.

Plus it helps weed out the cops.

know I wasn't a cop?

You're not a cop.

know all this stuff?

Experience.


Unbelievable. Where the
fuck have you been?

Sorry. I slept in.
Check your messages?

I called you three times.

I know, but I was working
late last night.

One job?
That's it, right?

Yep.

You don't have the luxury
to work one job a night.

All your regulars
have been calling

and asking for
new and improved girls.

Maybe it's time for you
to find some other game.

I don't know,
look for some office work.

What's come in?

I get calls,
just not for road kill.

Maybe it's time for a makeover,

squeeze another year
out of this.

I mean stuff.
I know what you mean.

Is that all?

You want more?
Make more money.

If you checked your messages
once in awhile,

you'd know the client from the
other day has been calling.

She called me,
like, three times.

She? Who's she?

The 119? Uptown?

Next to the pawn shop?

I sent you there two days ago.

The woman.
Yeah, right.

Hey, one of Mr. Roma's guys

came back here
looking for you earlier.

Sent them to your old address.

They said you don't
live there anymore.

No. No, I don't.

Where do you live?

It's none of your business.

Crazy bitch.

know all this stuff?

There's rules.

What are the rules?

no in-calls, no groups,

no freebies, no blacks,

no getting attached,

and don't do drugs with clients.

[Knock on door]

Hey.
Come on in.

So, what are we doing tonight?

Uh, I wanted to shoot nudes.

Oh, that's going to cost
you more than this.

Well, there's 3,500 in there.

Yeah, but that
gets me to the door.

I'm gonna need another 500.

Okay.

And I would love a drink.

You don't have to
do that, actually.

Um, here, you know what?
Here. Come here.

Come to the corner over there.

Maybe...

Maybe go down on the floor.

And if you, like...

So, I just, what?
Put my head here?

Should I put it back?

Like, push my tits out
or something?

Just be normal.
Normal?

I'm curious.

Why do you do this?

When I moved here from London,

I was in a bit of trouble.

So, someone offered me
a way out,

and, well, you know.

Out of what?

I had sex to pay for debt.
[Camera shutter clicks]

After that, it seemed,
I don't know, easy money.

Can you stand up, please?

Perfect.

Do you ever get sick of it all?

No.

Do you have any regrets?

you do in life, right?

Sometimes you just
gotta live your life

and hope it all works out.

Is that right?

You hungry?
Wanna get some food?

â™ª

[Woman singing indistinctly]


What are you doing?

Working.

Tell me, how do
you walk into a bar

and just find these...
Johns?

It's really not that difficult.

Any guy can become
a client or a John.

Like that one over there?
Exactly like that one.

Have you ever dated a John?

Sure.

You ever fall in love with one?

I try not to.
That's one of my rules.

Listen, I've gotta go.

Can I come?
Come?

Where?
With you.

That's gonna cost you
a whole lot more.

I understand.

Okay, well, maybe tomorrow.

Okay.

Catch you later.

So, what are you looking for?

What can I get?

â™ª And I'll use my legs

â™ª use my chest

â™ª use my hands

â™ª use my hips

[continues indistinctly]

â™ª

Sorry I'm so late.

It's okay.
Traffic was awful.

Oh, my god.
All right, what do I need?

Sorry, excuse the mess.
I'm in transition right now.

Sorry.

You, uh... you need a place to
stay?

No. I'm just staying
with a friend.

It's all good.

[Horn honks]

â™ª And everything
is your fault â™ª

[Continues indistinctly]

Okay.

Ready to get weird?

Thanks.

You don't think
he's gonna see that, do you?

I don't think so.
What do you think?

I guess it's okay.

Just gonna have to keep
him distracted, eh?

What time is he gonna be here?

Any minute.
Okay.

[Knock on door]

[Door bolt clicks]


[Kat giggling]

[Man moaning]

[Kat gasping]

[Man coughing]

That was fast.

They usually are.

[Chloe gasping]

So, how's it looking?

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Do you need some help with that?

No. God, no.

Oh, my god.

No, I'm not stupid.

Yeah, i... I know
what you told me.

I know, but come... come on.

Yeah.
She's here right now.

Okay.
Yeah, I'll get it.

You are fucked.
Why? What did he say?

He said you are fucked.

He said it to me,
and now I'm saying it to you.

So, what do I do?

I mean, this helps,
but it's not enough.

Fuck. I thought
we had a deal worked out.

We had a deal.

I thought so, too.

Why can't we just do
what we did the time before?

He don't want you no more.

He wants his money.

How much time have I got?

Zero.

It's out of my hands now.

So, how's the project going?

Are you almost done?
Uh, kind of.

I don't really know
if I've found my angle yet.

Why?
Maybe I can help.

Uh, thanks, but you've
already done enough.

God, I'll tell you,

all week I've been looking
at apartments,

and those bloody estate agents,

they want huge deposits

for rooms that are
smaller than a motel.

You don't think
I could get, like,

a bit or two upfront,
do you, of my pay?

Yeah, that's fine. I'll give
you a week in advance. Cool?

Thank you.
That would be brilliant.

Yeah.

How do I look?
Normal.

So, when we first met,

you told me that
there are rules.

Yeah, I mean,
they're not my rules.

They're just the rules.

What kind of rules?

Um, no in-calls.

Always meet at a hotel
or at the client's place.

Never let them know
where you live.

Don't do drugs with clients.

You've got to stay in control.

And no blacks.

That seems racist.

Yeah, it is,
but it's not my rules.

I didn't make 'em.

[Phone rings]

Sorry, hold on.

Hello? Yes.

No, I'm with a client
right now, dad.

No, it was to pay a model.

No, I don't care.
I do not...

No, it's my money.
I really don't care.

Sorry.
That went well?

My dad, he's an asshole.

Most are.

He always feels like he has to
be in control of everything.

Do you like being in control?

Maybe.

Okay, that's enough.
Bullets aren't cheap.

This is fun.
Yeah?

Do you... do you always
carry this thing on you?

Yep.
Why?

Have you ever been attacked
by a client before?

Not a client, but, um, a
crackhead in an alley once.

Never? -If you put in
enough time and effort,

then you can weed out the psychos and
the rapists before you meet them.

When you arrive you call in,

describe the client,
tell them where you're at,

and say you're gonna text
in 20 minutes.

Even if nobody's on
the other end of the phone,

at least the client thinks

there's some big
son of a bitch in the lobby.

So, you've never been attacked?

Not really.

Nothing that I didn't
get compensated for.

How'd you find this place?

It's where I used to work...

Just up the road.

Doing what?


We can leave.

I can handle it.
[Clears throat]

Did you really
used to work here?

It wasn't quite like this.

They're talented.

Come on.
Let's get out of here.

[Camera clicking and beeping]

What are you doing?
Uh...

Just, uh...

I'm... I'm, uh, taking
these pictures...

For documenting, I don't know,

my life and change.

In case you get famous
or something?

Or something.

Can I see them?
Uh, okay.

Wow.
These are beautiful.

Thank you.

What are you doing?

It's been
a really long time since...

I don't know what
you're talking about.

All right. Got it?
Yes.

To the bedroom.
Thank you.

You all right?
Uh-huh.

You wanna go get a beer?

Yeah. I'm gonna
go to the bathroom.


You ready?

Yeah. Wait.

After you.
Thank you very much.


I love the way
he layered the music sheets.

Collaging was really
big in the '60s.

It's very Jasper Johns.

That's actually layered?

Mm-hmm.
Don't touch it!

Stop it.

Stop it, I'm serious.
Don't do that.

I'm just messing with you.

I would never really touch it.

I've been to hundreds
of these pop-ups.

Clients used to love
bringing me here,

showing me off to their
intellectual friends and bosses.

It was fun.

And what happened?

I got old.

What do you think of this one?

Hmm.

It doesn't really match

the rest of the gallery,
does it?

Kind of muddy, dark.

Don't really know.

What do you think?

It's mine.

I didn't offend you, did I?

I mean, you're the one that said

you're a photographer,
not a painter.

And it really wasn't that bad.

You've just got
to get a new frame.

It's fine.

Hey, why don't you paint me?

I... why would I paint you?
I don't paint anymore.

I'm so hungry.
Are you hungry?

Please, paint me.

Do you like Sushi?

Come on, I've always
wanted to be painted

by a real artist.

What don't you get

about me not painting
anymore, okay?

Seriously, can we just get
dressed and go eat somewhere?


I just think that it
would be really good for us.

Oh.
It would be nice.

Do you?
Yes.

Don't you think?
I don't know.

Maybe one day.

We haven't talked about that.


I'm not stupid.
Nobody said you were.

It was an accident...
What kind of accident?

And a long time ago.

It doesn't need to concern you,

[knocking on door]
Chloe?



Chloe, it's dad.
Are you in there?

[Doorknob rattling]

Chloe?

[Locks rattle]
Chloe?

Did you just break in here?

No, you know I have keys.

Well, you can't just
come in here like that.

Oh, please, Chloe,

it's too early
in the morning to argue.

Come on, put some clothes on.

I'm gonna call the cops on you

and see how you
like being arrested.

You're smoking now?

No.

I had friends over last night.

Who?
Does it really matter?

Do I know them?

No.

Well, I just...
I just wanted to stop by

and see my beautiful daughter.

Dad, it's 9:00
in the morning.

Please stop spying on me.

I'm not spying on you.
I just...

Why don't you stick to your word

and leave me alone?

I will never leave you.

Don't you have
a fundraiser to run?

Remember?

Ugh, my dad.

The asshole?
Yeah.

Well, he seemed like
a nice man to me.

Well, he's not.
He can't be that bad.

At least he wanted to see you.

No, he doesn't,

he just called because
he wants me to come

to this gala thing on Saturday.

It's just...

Would you come with me?

Saturday, is it?

It could be fun, couldn't it?

Okay, if that's what you want.

Yeah, that's what I want.
Oh. The gala.

The gala.

Okay.
Okay.

[Giggling]
[Shouting and giggling]

â™ª

â™ª City bird, city bird

â™ª fly away
[No audible dialogue]

â™ª From my window

â™ª from my window

â™ª 'cause you don't sing...


Stop it.

Stop it.

Seriously, come on.
Stop it.

No, I don't want to.
I'm really happy.

I'm having a good time
shopping for clothes with you.

Well, then let's
just shop for clothes.

Stop hanging all over me.
What about that one?

You want it?
I'll buy it for you.

Yeah, I like it.
Yeah?

You like this one?
Yeah.

Yeah, I like that one.


Honestly.

You like it.

Yeah, but I'm twice your age.

It looks like you're
kissing your mother.

So, I'm... what are you
talking about? Who cares?

I like this one.
This one is good, too.

That would look
really good on you.

I like that one.

Have you seen any that you want?

No. I want you.

Kiss me.

No, I'm not working.

Oh, yes, you are.

Okay, that's enough.
Come on.

The worst.
Come on.

get this straight.

We're going to a party because
you hate everybody there.

Yes.

And you want them to know

that you're dating a prostitute.

Well, I wouldn't
take it that far, but...

So, you're paying me to be amazing
and suffer through it with you?

Mm-hmm. Correct.

You know what?
Hmm?

You're lucky I like you.

I know.

â™ª

[No audible dialogue]

[Woman singing indistinctly]

Ooh, fancy.

So, what is this gala for?

This is a charity
for Huntington's disease.

Let's go to the bar.

I thought
she was still in rehab.

Cheers, I guess.

Whoa. Easy tiger.

Don't tell.
Don't tell?

You look really pretty.
Thank you.

Yeah.

Yowza!

There is my girl!

You finally
came out of your cave.

What is up?
Same old.

Uh, this is my best friend Zoe.

This is Kat.
Hi.

Hello, Zoe.
It's so nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

I've heard absolutely
nothing about you,

because someone forgot
how to use their phone.

Jerk.

Ooh.
Waiter's calling my name.

Who wants bubbly?

Yeah, I think I'll be finished
by the time you get back.

Girl, I know exactly
how you feel.

I swear, my soul is made
of champagne and bacon.

She's funny.
She's cool.

Yeah, our parents grew up
together. She's rad.

Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

I'm so glad you could make it.

You look stunning, sweetheart.

Really, really lovely.
Thank you. Thank you.

Hi. I'm Chloe's father,

and you're...

This is my girlfriend,
Kat, I'm sorry.

It's an absolute pleasure
to meet you, sir.

What a gorgeous house you have.

Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

What do you do, Kat?

Oh, I model for your daughter.

Nudes, mostly.
Really?

Mr. d! What is shaking?
Zoe, how are you?

Oh, my god, I love the tie.

It's very norm-core.
Thank you.

Um, I'm doing good.
I'm doing good, you know?

Good.
Taking it day by day.

How are you and the folks?

Oh, you know,
the folks are good.

Yeah, same old, you know?

What's in there?

Nothing.

[Canister tapping]

[Women gasping]


[Women gasping]

[Muted chatter and laughter]

Whew!
It is hot in here.

[Chloe sniffs, grunts]

Oh, my god.

All of this used to be my room.

All my artwork was up
everywhere in here.

You name it... doodles,
drawings, paintings.

Um, my mom hung it.

She put it all up.

I mean, my dad turned this
into his fuck den.


Go on. -Yeah, I
bet you he had sex

right there where
you're sitting.

On this bed? Come on.

On this bed right here?
Right here.

No way.
What do you think he did?

With what kind of women?
Oh, god, I don't know.

Were they huskies?
Were they whores?

Oh, my god,

they must have been
absolute whores.

Come to me!
Mwah! Mwah!

Oh, my god.
Hey.

Yes?

What?

Promise you won't leave me.

I won't.

Back to the party.
Okay!

She's absolutely fantastic.

What medium do you work in?

She works in all mediums,
of course.

She's absolutely
bloody brilliant.

We're collaborating on
a project together right now.

Really?

Yeah, it's mainly photography,

but... and video,
of course.

And I'm... I'm trying
to project film

onto three -dimensional
canvases

and capture, obviously,
the piece in itself,

but also what's the second
before and after everything.

But I'm just still... still
figuring it out.

I'm one of the models.
Strictly nudes.

Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

Welcome to the 14th annual

"we care, we cure" gala.


Hi.
Hi.

I'm sorry I haven't called.

I've just been really busy
at the gallery,

but I wanna hear
how everything's coming.

[Father continues indistinctly]

Yeah. It's fine.

Everything's really good.

Don't worry about it.

Everything's coming along.

I can't wait to show you.
It's gonna be great.

It should be done soon.
Okay, good.

Just let me know
when you're ready.

Yeah, okay.
Let's listen.

after we were married

the tell-tale signs
began to appear...

The depression,

the dementia,

and probably
the worst for Gabriela,

loss of coordination.

As many of you know,

she was a very,
very strong woman,

and she fought.

Where have you been hiding?

I've been looking
everywhere for you.

I was in the bathroom.

Well, I'm really glad
that you're here.

I didn't even know if you
you got out of rehab.

Your dad's been super weird
about the whole thing.

I'm fine. I'm fine.
I've just been working a lot.

Yeah, and getting
some action clearly.

Yes.

And with that in mind,

I would like to introduce to you

another very special person,

who has inspired not only me,

but all those who have
ever heard her story...

Jackie Sorka.
[Applause]

Thank you all very much.

I'm so honored to be here.


Eight months ago,

I decided to embark
on an inevitable journey

that threatened to change
the course of my life.

My brother and I watched
Huntington's disease

take our father's life

with a 50% chance
of having the h.T. Gene,

I chose not to get
tested as a child.

But as my heart grew
harder and harder to invest,

I made the hard choice.

I picked up the phone.

I called my doctor.

I called my family

and my loved ones.

We were prepared for
anything and everything

except being thrown off-course
by a positive result.

I mean, s.A.T.'S
and weddings and children...

I had planned for so much life.

I mean, every day
brings new challenges,

but I am determined to pack in
fifty years of life

if all I have is ten left.




Hey. I thought you said you
weren't gonna leave me.

What are you talking about?
I was right there.

Here it is.
Thank you.

Give me a call sometime.

Where's your wife?
You ditch her?

Excuse me?
Your wife.

I'm not...
what's going on?

I don't know, uh...

What are you two doing out here?

I... I... sorry.

I think you should come

and get some fresh air maybe?

You're a little worked up.

Me? I'm not the one trying
to fuck random guys.

Maybe I should, um...

It was nice meeting you.
That it was.

What are you talking about?

I thought you said
you weren't gonna leave me.

I didn't.
I was right there.

Chloe!

Chloe!

I didn't leave you.

You were the one
who disappeared.

Oh, come on, just admit it.
You were working.

I was talking to people!

Just admit it.
You were working.

No, I swear!
That is not what happened!

I wasn't trying to fuck the guy.

He just wanted a cigarette.

Come on.

Get your fucking hands off me.

Chloe, Chloe, let me talk to you

for just a minute, please!

It's fine, I'll get her.


Oh, my god. You don't... you
don't care about anyone.

You don't fucking care
about yourself.

fit was about in there?

I mean, what the fuck was that?

You know,
I've never been in love.

Don't say it.

Why?

Because this isn't it.

Well, I wanted to say it
before you go.

I'm going?

Where am I going?

You just gotta go.

Take off your dress.
What?

Take off your dress.
Why?

Because I want to do one last
interview with you before you leave.

Oh, I'm leaving tonight?
Yes.

Then I'm leaving now.
No, you're not.

Take this. Here. It's
everything and a little extra.

Take off your clothes.

Don't sit.
You always sit.

Here, stand.

There we go.

Wait, stop.

I want the truth from you.

You have a kid, am I right?

Had. I had a kid.

Yeah?
What happened?

I gave it away.

You gave it away.

Was it a he or a she or...

It.

It grew inside of me, I had it,

I gave it away.

Did you ever try to find...

No, and that's
the end of that story.

How could you just...
easily.

I didn't know or care if I was
pregnant until it was too late.

How could you just...
what? What?

You don't understand

how a mother could just
give away her child

and never think about it again?

I'm nobody's mother.

I'm just a woman who gave up

on her little girl.

So, it was a girl?

Sure.
Do you know what?

Are you done working out
your mommy issues?

This has nothing to do with me.

Oh, it isn't?
Unh-unh.

You take me to your mother's
charity event.

You go batshit crazy
when I start to flirt.

You come home here and you
just grill me about my scar.

Do you want a whore
or a therapist?

Oh, maybe you want
another mother.

Stop it.

You could never be my mother

because my mother was loving.

Blah, blah, blah.
Get the fuck out.

Get out, get out, get out.

I don't give a shit.
Now!

I'm leaving anyway.

How long can you keep
a whore around, huh?

What you think for dinner?
Maybe barbeque?

Oh, where the fuck
have you been?

Working.
Really? That's good.

I hope this is it, because Mr.
Roma is all over my ass now.

Yeah, it's not enough, but I'm gonna
give to you in two, three days.

How's that supposed to happen?

I don't fucking know.

This is your job.
I need clients.

You should probably keep this

because there's
nothing out there.

Nothing out there,
or nothing out there for me?

Take your pick.

I got girls turning 20
that are in for a surprise.

Twenty. It's dry.

I'll do anything.

I'll do parties.

I'll even do groups.

Anything.

Anything?

Well, there's something,
but it is not good.

You hear me?
Anything.

Not good.
I'll do anything.

It pays well, but it's not good.

That's okay.

Anything.
I can do it.

All right.
I'll call you.

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Chloe, I think it's
important for you to know

that I never did anything to mom

that she didn't ask me to do.

Your mom didn't
want to suffer, so she...

Chloe, you need help.

That's why we're here,

Mr. Kenner and I would like
to discuss your options.

You know?

Chloe, mom had Huntington's
for many years.

I love you.

[Knock on door]

You Pete?

You can put your shit over
there.

Hey, um, could you help me
with something?

Sure, anything.
I need to find someone.

Okay.

share any of that with me?

You're good.
So this is it?

Yeah.
Just in front of this?

Yeah. That's it.
Let's do it.

Okay, so rent here
is not free, okay?

Got it.

work if you need it.

Let's just do it. -Yeah,
let's see what you got.

Whoa, what are you...

Stop, stop, stop.
Whoa, stop.

Is this your first time?
Slowly, babe, okay?

Slowly. I gotta sell
this shit to people.

Try again.

All right, make it look
like you're into it.

Look like you like it.

Okay, you gotta... you gotta be
hap...

You look like
you're about to fucking cry.

Try and be happy.

a few questions, okay?

Okay.

What's your name?
Amy.

Hmm. Your mommy
said we could talk.

She's not my real mommy.

You wanna stop doing this?

another damn question.

Do you wanna stop doing this?


No.

think that you will?

Sure, you know,
in a year or two.

Sure.
Oh, no, no, no.

No, I'm planning on doing
this maybe one more year,

two at the most.

Uh, yeah, one,
maybe two years tops.

[Knocking on door]

Are you in there?

Chloe?

Oh.

Hello, is Chloe around?

No, sorry.
She's in an appointment.

Okay.

Well, do you know when
she's gonna be home?

I don't. Sorry.

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Look, can I just come in
and get my stuff?

I don't think
that's really a good idea.

Fuck.

Are you okay, though?
Yeah.

I'll swing by later.

You know she's sick.

Chloe's gonna lose
her independence

and she needs people
who can take care of her.

Do you honestly think
you can do that?

Do you like what you do?

good at what I do.

When I'm with a client,
I'm exactly what they want.

Not what they say they want,

not what they think they want,

I'm what they don't know
they want.

What do I want?

to come in here

and shit all over your world,

make you do things you really
want to do, but can't.

You said you wanted
brutal honesty because you

are looking for someone
to come in here

and tell you things
you don't want to hear.

Shit.

What're you doing here?

I was really worried about you.

Sorry, I just used
my key to get in.

You didn't get back to me.
I didn't hear from you.

It's cool.

Um, did you, uh, touch anything?

No.

'Cause I had everything
set up on this table

that was really for...
no.

There were these Polaroids...

Look, Chloe, everyone's really
worried about you, okay?

And, um,
your girlfriend stopped by.

My... Kat stopped by?

Yeah.

When did Kat come by?

I don't know.
20, 30 minutes ago.

Look, are you okay?
Fuck.

Look, you gotta
talk to me, okay?

Yeah.
Yeah?

What's going on?
[Sighs] I'm just hot.

Yeah, you're hot?

Okay, I'm gonna get you
a glass of water,

and, um, I'm gonna call
your dad, all right?

Don't call my dad.
Don't call my dad.

Don't call my dad.
Chloe?

What do you want?
You gotta talk to me.

Can you help me?

Can you help me with something?
Come here.

Ooh. Okay.
It's okay.

It's okay.
My hands.

Yeah, I know.
I know. I know.

Do you want me to help you? You
want to tell me what to do?

Mm-hmm.
Okay.

I'd like if you can
just pull up this file

with the one where she's sitting

in the bathroom, um...

The one that's
a little bit closer

and on her face.

Okay. This is the one

I'm going to setup, okay?

He's here.

Come on, hurry up.

[Door opens, closes]

Isn't he the guy
from the chat room?

How the hell should I know?

Come on.
[Snaps fingers]

thing about your work?

Beatings,

not getting paid,

gettin' harassed by pigs
and arrested.

I... what do you think?

Being treated
like a human toilet.

That I can't go back.
[Chloe] Back where?

Back home.

[Keyboard clicking]

[Voice mumbles]

Come here.

No in call.

Always meet at a hotel
or the client's place.

Never let them know
where you live.


Don't do drugs with clients.
Gotta stay in control.

[Telephone ringing]


You gotta stay in control.

Never let them know
where you live.

You've got to stay in control.

They're never my rules. They're
the rules to keep you safe.

What kind of rules?

Um, no in calls

or at the client's place.

Never let them know

Don't do drugs with clients,

Ugh, uh, r-right now?

Okay. Um, I'll text you

He's coming over now.
So get ready.

[Knocking on door]

Well, come on, join us.
Don't be scared.

Come in.

What are we doing here?

Filming house extra.

I know. Sit.

Where's the blow?

You complaining right now?

So, uh,

how'd you get started?

I was stripping
at bachelor parties,

and, uh, switched over.

Remember your first time?


No, not really.


Everything all right?

What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

Nothing bad
has ever happened to me.

Not yet.

You ever fall in love
with a client?

No, that's not me.

[Clears throat]
I'm gonna go get a six pack.

What?
You serious?

Look. He's a friend
of Conrad's, okay?

Relax.

[Door opens, closes]

You want a hit?

You just gonna sit there
and say nothing?

Fuck it.
I'll do another one.

What is that shit, man?

I'm not into that fucking shit.


I'm not doing it.

I'm not fucking into that shit.

Fuck it.

I'm not into that shit.

Ah! Ow!

What?
What the fuck?

What's wrong?

What... what?

What's...
Get out.

Get out.
Get the fuck out!

What're you talking about?
Get the fuck out!

Oh, my god.

[Muffled voice]
No, no, no!

[Gasping, coughing]

Room SSI.

[Kat choking, silence]


you on purpose.

I'm not leaving you on purpose.

I'm not leaving you on...


[Gasps]
[Monitor beeping]


How do you get through it?

The drugs.

Hope.

I just do.

I believe you know my client

miss Chloe Davis?

Yes, I do.

How did you find me?

I'm the executor
of miss Davis' estate.

Miss Davis has set up
a trust fund in your name.

Trust fund?

I take it miss Davis
didn't discuss this with you.

She came to me about a month ago

to adjust her will
amongst other things.

A week ago I hired
a private detective

to track you down.

Shortly thereafter,

he informed us of your incident.

We spoke to the police and, uh,

they have not found the man
who did this to you.

They've also not
been able to locate

a Mr. uh, Conrad Setch.
What'd you mean you left?

The man who dropped you off
at the hospital.

Get the fucking car, idiot!

Doesn't surprise me.

Now, miss Fuller.

I don't know what your
relationship was with miss Davis,

nor does it matter.

This trust fund was set up

with several strict conditions

of which I will be
monitoring closely.

If you neglect
that in way shape or form

to abide by these conditions,

the trust will be null and void

and all of the funds
will be donated to charity.

An opportunity here,
miss Fuller,

one that very few people
are ever given.

Have you been listening to me,
miss Fuller?

Every word.

She told me to tell you
one last thing,

is that you attend
her art exhibit.

Toby, 20.

I'm Alexia, I'm 22.

Since I was little,

I always wanted to be a singer.

I wanted to be famous

and be a really awesome
female rock star.

That would be cool.
Not getting paid.

I'm Alexia, I'm 22.

Gettin' harassed by pigs
AMD arrested.

What do you think?
Not gettin' paid.

[Overlapping voices]
Awesome female rock star.

Gettin' harassed by pigs
and arrested.

What do you think?
That would be cool.

Not gettin' paid,

gettin' harassed by pigs
and arrested.

What do you think?
What's this for?

Not gettin' paid...
Eighteen.

Jonas. -Gettin' harassed
by pigs, and arrested.

What's this for?
To be in love.

Eighteen. -With somebody
who isn't ashamed of me.

Jonas.
What's this for?

[Overlapping voices]

With somebody
who isn't ashamed of me.

What's this for?
Jonas.

[Voices continue]

to be in love.

With somebody
who isn't ashamed of me.

Jonas.

I grew it inside of me.

I had it, I gave it away.

I didn't know, okay, I was
pregnant until it was too late.

I found a couple out of state
who wanted to adopt.

I had a kid.
I gave it away.

"It," I grew it inside of me,

I had it, I gave it away.

I didn't know, okay, I was
pregnant until it was too late.

I found a couple out of state...
what's your name?

Amy.

I had a kid.
How old are you, Amy?

Eight.
I gave it away.

How can a mother
give away her child

and never think about it?
How old are you, Amy?

Eight. -And that's
the end of the story.

And that's the end of the story.

She's not my real mommy.

What's your name?
Amy.

How old are you, Amy?
Eight.

Your mommy said we could talk.

She's not my real mommy.

Have you ever met
your real mommy?

No.

Do you want to?

What's your name?
Amy.

How old are you, Amy?
Eight.
