Quiet night, boys?

Yes, sir.

Gentlemen, we owe a quarterly.

Vault 23, encryption download.

Loaded.

Level five. Sonic, please.

Stable.

Motion.

Stable.

Status check, please.

<i>All secure.</i>

<i>Excellent.</i>

Carry on, gentlemen.

-Come on. Come on!
-What're you doing, man?

All right. All right, we're here.

What restaurant is this?
Where the front door at?

We go in the back.
lt's like VlP, you know?

Only cool people go in the back,
like Madonna. . .

. . .and Dennis Rodman
and Gary Coleman.

lt's real controversial stars
coming in this place.

All right.

l'm not doing it.

All we gotta do is knock this off.

We'll get a couple of grand.
l been casing this joint for months.

Look.

You been casing it
and got one picture?

Film is expensive. Look at that.

Shrimp? You on parole and you here
trying to go back for stealing shrimp?

Not shrimps, baby. Prawns.

What the fuck is a prawn?

A prawn is bigger than shrimp. You
ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail?

And they real big
like they been working out?

Like they on steroids?
That's prawns.

Eating one prawn,
that's like five or six shrimp.

Yeah, right.
l'm going back to the truck.

Fredo did the same thing to Michael
in <i>The Godfather.</i>

''Fredo, don't ever go
against the family.

Don't disrespect me and my father.
Get the fuck out here! ''

You're deviating.

Give me a second.

We don't have a second.

Go back to the truck.

l'll finish up here.

Glove.

Ninety seconds. Perfect.

Send down the lift.

Yeah.

l don't think so.

What? What are you talking about?

The first conversation that
we ever had. No fucking guns!

You listen to me, Jaster.

You send down that fucking lift!

-Fuck you, you freak show!
-What are you doing?

No!

Wait.

Wait!

Crazy motherfucker!

No!

Stop!

<i>--frigid weather conditions</i>
<i>continue to pound the New York area.</i>

You fucking nuts?

No.

l'm fine.

Thanks for your concern.

-What the hell is wrong with him?
-Hold on.

He's really disrespecting
my speed right now.

He's about to bite me in the ass.
Disrespecting your speed?

Where the hell they get a Doberman?

Where's a nice, slow rottweiler
when you need him?

You cased it for months
and didn't see a 200-pound dog?

They was puppies when l saw them.
All right.

On three, you go right, l'll go left.

Fuck that. l go wrong all the time.
l'm going right.

Okay, brother, whatever.

One, two, three, break out.

Gotta hurry.
Yeah, what you want now, huh?

One-on-one.
lt's me and you, baby. Me and you.

Well, it can just be you.
lt can just be you.

How long does it take to
get these out of development?

Because, you know, l been working
on my little portfolio.

You're lucky l pulled my hamstring.

Y'all would still be chasing me.

You're saying that your partner
was a midget on a skateboard?

Midgets is taking over. They took
over this playground where l live.

They got this whole little
midget underworld.

lt's crazy.

They squeezing us out because
they selling everything half-price.

l'm innocent, yo.

Oh, innocent, huh?

Man, if you didn't have a gun,
l'd whup your ass.

Where'd you get this then, huh?
A cocktail party?

-What do you got?
-We got nothing.

Both shot in the back of the head,
execution-style.

Could be a 9 mil or a .38.
l couldn't find any empty shells.

They died about three hours ago,
l would say.

All right, listen up.

My name is Edgar Clenteen.

l'm the chief investigator, Special
Projects Unit, U.S. Treasury Dept.

This is my crime scene.

And you all are contaminating it.

We got two young men here. . .

. . .executed inside one of
the most secure rooms on earth.

So whatever you find, l don't care
what it is, you bring it to me.

l will not have anyone
fucking up this investigation.

Now get out of here.

Let Forensics do their work.

Go on. Get out.

l got one.

We ran an AFlS match
on the fingerprint.

John Delano Jaster, a heavy-equipment
operator with two prior felonies.

-Where the hell do l find him?
-He's at Rikers.

-Who's this?
<i>-Well, who is this?</i>

John Jaster, asshole. You're in
my house. Put my wife on the phone.

<i>Oh, hey, Mr. Jaster.</i>
<i>Your wife stepped out.</i>

She told me to get the phone. . .

. . .in case this was you
and, you know, it was.

<i>Who are you?</i>

l'm just here fixing the heat. ls
there a number she can reach you at. . .

<i>...or a message or something?</i>
<i>She has been worried sick about you.</i>

-You fix the heat, huh?
<i>-Yeah, that's right.</i>

Let me tell you something.

Lady said you'd never go for it, but
you'd save yourself a lot of grief. . .

. . .you put in a new thermostat.

<i>Don 't worry about my thermostat.</i>
<i>Tell my wife that I'm in Rikers.</i>

Oh, you don't say?

Just tell her to get her ass
down here and get me out.

Don't worry about it, pal.
l'll be sure to tell her.

Jerk-off.

Oh, that was your husband.

He wants you to get him out of jail.

But you've had a difficult day.

Why don't l do it?

Good morning, sir.

l'd better not be wasting my time.

Wooly, what do you got?

Jaster's in a holding cell
with an Alvin Sanders.

Some guy they picked up on a petty
theft heist for stealing shrimp.

-Shrimp?
-Shrimp.

That's pure nerve gas. You can use
that shit for weapons and shit.

You burned the hairs out my nose.

l see why they arrested you.
They gotta protect the public.

l'm sorry. l suppose
you smell like daffodils.

You should be mad at your ass.
You and your ass should get a divorce.

-l don't feel good.
-Well, that makes two of us.

Did you eat some shit on a half shell?
Yeah, grunt. Get it out.

See, that's--
Yo, what's up? What's up, man?

lt's my heart.

Yo, guard!
We need a doctor in here right now!

-What's up?
-The pills. Get the pills.

Hold on. l'm coming, l'm coming.

All right. All right, just relax.
You all right?

l'm gonna get somebody
for you, all right?

-Alvin.
-Yeah.

-ls that your name?
-Yeah.

You probably know me. The shrimp
heist, but it was actually prawns.

-lf l don't make it--
-Oh, come on with that.

Can you just listen?
This is important.

l need you to get
a message to my wife.

Tell her. . .

. . .that she should go
to the Bronx Zoo.

-Yeah. The Bronx Zoo. All right.
-Please.

Tell her, ''There's no place
like home. ''

What about Toto. . .

. . .and, you know,
the yellow brick road?

What kind of pills you taking?

Are you through?

You get that message to her.

l'll make it worth your while.

Cool, cool.
Now, what if you do make it?

You still break a brother off?
l need some change in my pocket.

Damn, he already shit all over--

Hands over your head and don't move.

Drag this piece of crap upstairs.

Dude was already sick. He was about
to die. What's wrong with you?

Don't treat him like that.

Don't treat him
like an animal like that.

Y'all push him around. lf it was me,
l wouldn't take that bullshit.

Are you a doctor?

We're ready here, sir.

You been working out, huh?

Sir?

Yeah, you better talk to him, boy.

You lucky these bars here.
You don't know who you fooling--

Okay, you coming back.

l'll be right up here
getting my sleep.

l'll whup your ass.

You don't know who you just
grabbed up on. l'm a gangster.

l see you coming.

Come here where there's no light,
l'll whup you.

You got your boys
with your billy sticks.

l'm Alvin, baby, king of the seafood.
They know me around these corridors.

Explain it to me, John.

How do you steal 40 million in gold
and not have the cash to make bail?

l don't know
what you're talking about.

l'm out of aspirin.

Could you get me some?

Chewable.

How'd it happen?

How do you pull
the heist of the decade. . .

. . .and get busted for a DWl?

What kind of man. . .

. . .goes out celebrating. . .

. . .after he pops two boys
in the back of the head?

Look, l didn't. . . .

You're not hanging that on me.

They were on the floor. . .

. . .facedown.

lt was an execution, pure and simple.

No guns, man.

Look, l'm a contractor.
l'm no fucking shooter!

Then who?

Just give me the names.

A name. lt was just. . . .

There was just one other guy.
lt was me and him.

-Bullshit. Bullshit!
-One guy. One guy!

l swear it.

Computer is what this guy's got.

He's got the whole government wired.

Who?

Come on, Jaster, tell me who.

Give me the goddamn name, Jaster.
Just give me a name.

Please, listen to me.

Get me a doctor.

Get me a doctor. Please.

-l'll give you a name.
-You're giving me a brain tumor.

You give me a pass,
l'll give you the fucking gold!

Nobody knows where it is
but me, you know.

Did you burn your partner?

l need a doctor.

You took the gold
and left him there, didn't you?

No wonder you drank. You figured
jail was the best place to lay low.

Just keep pulling my chain. . .

. . .keep on with
with this happy horseshit. . .

. . .l'll make sure
you do need a doctor.

-Ed?
-What, goddamn it?!

l don't think he's faking.

Damn, l was just trying
to have a good meal.

Damn!

And l just thought you had gas.

Oh, shit.

-What the hell?
-Get in there.

Move it.

You lucky. Oh, you lucky.

Sit down, Alvin.

Not there.

Oh, yeah. Got reserved seats.

Watching the game?

Big screen.

Hey, look, l apologize. . .

. . .about that irreverent shit
l displayed in the cell.

l was out of line.

l had been lifting weights. . .

. . .and l just got through doing curls,
so l was real tense.

Hey, Alvin?

l got some good news.

And bad news.
Want to hear the good news?

Yeah, l mean, good news is great.

You're fucked.
Want to hear the bad news?

l think you just told me the bad news.

Unless you want to tell me
worser news.

You're alone in a room with me.

Yeah, right.

So, what you want?

You and. . . .

You and Jaster were alone
in that cell for eight hours.

All alone.

You must have talked about something.

His bowels.

He was shitting and coughing
and it didn't smell good.

How do you talk to somebody like that?

-lt's terrible.
-Alvin.

l do this for a living.

You think l can't see that
you're hiding something?

Okay, everybody out.

Alvin, think about Jaster. . .

. . .and tell me
where you want the bruises.

You trying to try
some sneaky shit, huh?

Gonna fool me with the quiet voice
while you beat on my body.

You can do that,
but you can't beat on my soul.

Do the words ''Stokley Carmichael''
mean anything to y'all?

Reverend Malcolm X?
Reverend Al Sharpton?

l see you taking off your Timex.

l ain't telling you shit nor
the brothers behind the aquarium.

You can kiss my ass
with your tongue. . .

. . .and l will take
this information to my grave.

The man said something
about the Bronx Zoo, okay?

Well?

We completed our search
of The World of Darkness.

That would be your bats,
your leopard cats, your mole rats.

We came up empty, sir.

''There's no place like home. ''

-lt's gotta be a building.
-We checked them all.

We checked the monkey house,
the reptile house, the giraffe house.

Even the outhouse.

We scanned the entire grounds
to a depth of 20 feet.

This guy was
a heavy-equipment operator.

Five minutes with a machine,
he could've buried the gold anywhere.

So where does that leave us, sir?

Square-fucking-one.

Come on, let's go
check the outhouse again.

Let's go.

<i>We have a national security crisis.</i>

Citadel 4 is the same system we use
to safeguard our nuclear facilities.

This guy took it apart like
he was hot-wiring a Toyota.

l'll give you the short version.

We're talking world-class loner.

A guy who spent literally tens
of thousands of hours at a computer. . .

. . .feeling around in the dark.
Nothing but math.

Nothing but numbers.

His sense of well-being, his very
sanity is predicated on completion.

Only this time,
the equation is incomplete.

He didn't get the 42 million in gold
he'd worked so very hard for.

That's our edge.

Now this. . . .

This is what l need your money for.

lt's a BC-1 9.

lt's an experimental tracking device.

Dr. Harris here can fill you in.

Well, it's quite simple, really.

The BC-1 9 has a proprietary signal. . .

. . .broadcast and location.

lt's got a 1 0-mile radius and
full satellite coordinate tracking.

Now, the optimum placement site. . .

. . .is the temporal mandibular joint.

lt's just below the jaw.

All right, look. . .

. . .we implant this in
the appropriate subject, put him. . .

. . .on the street, make it known
he knows where the gold is. . .

. . .and l guarantee that our elusive
computer whiz will show up.

Who would be willing to have
that thing implanted in their jaw?

Senator. . .

. . .we already have a volunteer.

This is Howard Cosell.

Down goes Frazier!

Come on.

Tenderize that bitch, Alvin.

-What you got?
-l got all kinds of shit.

Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

What do you know about boxing?

l ain't gotta box.
l get my skills from TV.

l got Mike Tyson skills.
You biting me!

My ears, my ears!

l'll go Muhammad Ali on them.

-That's cold.
-That ain't right.

That ain't right.

Once l get out of here, l'll get
my big score. l'll be set for life.

l'll get me a 1 -year-old Arabian.

A 1 -year-old?
What sick shit is that?

l'm talking horses. Thoroughbreds.
They got royalty in their blood.

-What you know about horses?
-l know everything.

My father took me to the horse track.

Taught me everything
about thoroughbreds.

l'm teaching you awareness here.
See, l'm always aware.

Stay aware of everything.
Are you watching? Watch my skills.

l'm always aware. See my eyes?
l'm on a swivel.

Can't nobody sneak up on you
and just get with you. That's--

Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws
are we breaking here?

You don't want to know.

Ladies and gentlemen.

You've all distinguished yourselves.

You're all the best at what you do.

Encryption.

Hardware.

Signal analysis.

And as of this moment. . .

. . .nothing else in your lives exists.

You no longer exist.

Welcome aboard.

Don't disappoint me.

Sir, l'm in.

All right, here we go.

Case number 1 41 1 263.

Subject: Alvin Dean Sanders.

Former cellmate: John Delano Jaster.

Released from Sing Sing prison Friday.

Treasury surveillance
subcontract required.

Pay-grade status approved.

Split-shift overtime coverage.

Contact Special Agent Vicks
at tspec.com.

Ed, you actually think this guy is
surfing Treasury Department files?

What if he can't decode this?
We can make a less secure encryption.

Maybe we should indicate we think
Sanders knows where the gold is.

Listen to me. l had a grandfather
who was a trapper by profession.

Now he had two prices
on his card: wolf. . .

. . .and everything else.

<i>Now a wolf...</i>

<i>... will starve itself to death...</i>

<i>...rather than make a mistake.</i>

You have to lay down a scent
that smells real from far away.

<i>And the bait...</i>

<i>...has to be fresh</i>
<i>and untouched by human hands.</i>

<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>

<i>... we are hunting wolf.</i>

Send the message.

<i>Voice recognition, please.</i>

<i>Voice recognition, please.</i>

Bristol here.

-All is well and good.
<i>-Good morning, sir.</i>

Mainframe up, please.

<i>Mainframe boot sequence complete.</i>

System check, please.

<i>All systems are online.</i>

Let's see. . . .

Overnights, please.

<i>Overnights loading from NSA...</i>

<i>...and Treasury Department</i>
<i>servers U. S. dot gov.</i>

<i>Overnights loaded, ready for review.</i>

Where shall we start today?

-NSA, please.
<i>-NSA loaded.</i>

A secret, huh?

l love a secret.

Alvin. . .

. . .do you feel like a lucky man?

No. Yes.
Well, it depends on what you. . . .

Of all the many crimes
that men commit. . .

. . .the worst punishment
is rewarded those. . .

. . .who squander their good fortune.

-You're right, you're right.
-You understand me?

No, sir.

Mr. Sanders. . .

. . .you were arrested and booked. . .

. . .by a police officer
named Wayne Miller for. . .

. . .theft of shrimp.

Well, you know,
actually they were prawns.

You know the big jumbo shrimp
that's, like, at least a dollar--

Six weeks ago,
in an internal investigation. . .

. . .Miller admitted to a dozen counts
of falsifying evidence.

Son of a. . .

. . .Jesus.

Thank God for people
that come forward.

Needless to say, we've been petitioned
to repudiate the convictions.

Repudiation is what--

What everybody needs more of
is a little repudiation.

Now, repudiation is. . . .
Use it in a sentence.

l have a short sentence
for you, Alvin.

You walk.

l'm back, baby!

You miss me?

l'm free!

New York City, do you feel me?

Okay, let's take it for a spin.

Time code is locked.
Satellite uplink is sealed.

Tracking is a go.

<i>Hey, yo, taxi!</i>

<i>Yeah, where you going there?</i>

<i>I'm trying to get to Queens.</i>

<i>Jeez, that's bad for me.</i>

<i>I don 't go to Queens.</i>

<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>I seldom get there.</i>
<i>Where is it?</i>

Copy that.
All right, guys, we're up.

Checking sound levels.
Levels are stable, sir.

Good. We have a visual?

Air Unit, this is Mobile 1 .
Confirming.

We have a visual. Do you copy?

<i>Roger that. The bird has ears.</i>

Who is it?

l hear you didn't pay your bill.
l'm here for your bills.

-My mom ain't here.
-Just like you people.

-Get your ass away from my door.
-Come out.

What's up?

-What's going down?
-What's happening, baby?

-You escape?
-As a matter of fact. . . .

Quit playing so much. You know
l got warrants and stuff around here.

-They don't just let people go.
-They let me go.

Well, that sound like some bullcrap.

<i>It wasn 't. They can 't hold me.</i>

<i>I'm the man.</i>
<i>Alvin, king of the seafood.</i>

<i>Oh, my God, Steven.</i>

Oh, my God.
My stomach hurts and l'm crying.

What's wrong? Happy to be out?

You a full-fledged criminal. Look.
lt's like <i>The Price is Right.</i>

That's right. That's right.

Mom's still here, right?

We live here now.

Tell him, Stevie.

''Tell me, Stevie. ''

What is that?

That's a Tika.

We about to get married
when she gets that blood test.

That's a bullshit test.

You're just fucking with me.

Yeah.

-Make sure she gets all her shots.
-l'm gonna do that.

Where'd you get all this?

Julio and Ramundo cut me in
on a sweet Godfather deal.

See, you cut Julio and Ramundo out.

lt's just me and you.
We back on the block.

This guy's a real beauty.

Are you surprised?

l think l'll go. . .

. . .see my girl, Lisa.

-Who?
-Lisa.

That won't be pretty.

What you mean?
She ain't been seeing nobody, has she?

lt ain't like l'm tripping
on the whole thing.

l mean, not that l give a damn.

They'll do what they do
and l'll do what l do.

Right, that's how you are.
You ain't never been like--

l'm gonna shower and run over.

-Good seeing you, bro.
-Good seeing you.

-She probably--
-You went crazy since. . . .

l'll put my work in, though.
You my money.

Who's Lisa?

That's the girlfriend.

They were living together.

<i>Lisa Hill, 27...</i>

<i>...assistant manager of Book Stew,</i>
<i>a used bookstore in Soho.</i>

<i>She also waits tables</i>
<i>at the Sunrise Lounge.</i>

There better not be nobody
in there either. l'm serious.

lf there is, and if he ain't big,
l'll put the boots to him.

Put the boots on him.

Hang on.

You're early.

You damn right l am.

Oh, my God. Alvin?

What up?
You going on a date behind my back?

Fuck you, Alvin.

That's music to my ears.
Where do you want it? The couch?

You disappear for two years, then have
the nerve to ask about my life?

Fuck you, Alvin.

You mean, like really ''fuck you''
fuck you? Like ''motherfuck you''?

Bad move, Alvin.
Can't be too jealous.

<i>-Turn around and walk out.</i>
<i>-I got you flowers.</i>

Oh, thank you. Now you can leave.

You need to pump your brakes
and recognize that your man is home.

So, what happened, Alvin?
You escaped?

Yeah, we had to tunnel out.
lt was terrible.

They released the dogs. They caught
up with me and my whole crew.

<i>Harriet Tubman, Kunta Kinte.</i>
<i>Harriet don 't move like she used to.</i>

The dogs was chewing all on her ass.

You know what, l don't have time
for this random gibberish.

There was a dirty cop
so they let me go.

Congratulations. Now leave.

You don't mean that.

How come you didn't come see me?
You didn't write me or nothing.

l was going to come see you.
l was gonna write you and tell--

You wouldn't understand.

l wouldn't understand? l don't
understand why we ain't celebrating.

l'm out. l'm back home.

Home? No, see, this is my house.

l pay the bills, l pay the rent.
You pay. . .?

Exactly. Excuse me.

You're upset. Stevie was the one
behind the whole thing.

l was on my way to church.

The next thing l know, l'm stealing.

Stevie? l don't remember hearing
anything about Stevie going to jail.

Lisa, look at me. Do l look
like l've been in day camp?

l been around hard-core criminals.

l'd like something soft
up against my body.

l'd like to have a home-cooked meal,
a hug from my woman.

What about a table dance?

-Prison has changed me.
-Oh, really?

Yes, it has. And l'm ready
for responsibility. What is that?

What do you think it is?

A puppy, l hope.

lt's not a puppy.

What you been doing since l been gone?

What's going on?

Sweetie.

This is your son, Alvin.

That ain't my son.

You think l made it up?

l don't know.

l mean, how?

How? That night,
after Stevie's birthday party.

Yeah, we did and. . .

. . .wow.

He don't really look like me.
He kind of chubby, ain't got no teeth.

Kind of cute.

Can l hold him?

Don't be like that.
Can l hold my son?

He calling for his daddy anyway.

Please?

l cannot believe this. Look at this!

Doesn't it trip you out?

Me and you, and the next thing
you know, we got this.

lt's like half and half,
l guess, you know.

-He'll be a little player.
-He won't be a player.

He's strong. Look at that grip.
Big old fella.

l think he sprung a leak.
He kind of smells.

Never mind, Alvin.

l'm going to work. The babysitter
will be here in five minutes.

Come on, Lisa.

Just give me another chance.
l'll get out there, l'll get a job.

Take care of myself.
l'll take care of you.

We got a whole little family.
Don't squeeze me out of that.

You know, Alvin,
it's been really hard.

l know. lt's hard for everybody.

Okay, but you gotta prove yourself.

-You gotta get a job.
-l'll get that.

-Stay out of jail.
-l don't remember how to get to jail.

And stop dressing like a thug.

l'll get a new Versace, Gucci.

Maybe l'll consider--

-Making love to your man?
-Having dinner with you.

You'll like the way l cook.
While l was in there, taught me how.

l can cook you anything.

French. <i>Bon giorno.</i>
l can cook ltalian. <i>Ciao, bella.</i>

Or l can cook, like, soul food.

''Daisy, check your greens.
They done spoiled now. ''

-Goodbye, Alvin.
-Can l get a kiss?

-Goodbye, Alvin.
-All right. Take it easy.

-Lisa?
-Yes?

What's my son's name?

-His name is Gregory.
-Gregory.

Gregory.

G-Dog! That's all right.

That's your daddy.

l think old Alvin just
might make it this time.

Alvin Sanders is bait.

That's all he is.

When he's served his purpose. . .

. . .when he draws our man
out of the shadows. . . .

Well, you know what happens to bait.

Well, well, well.

<i>Sequence complete.</i>

Look at this shit.

Clown.

Sushi chef.

Male exotic dancer.

That might be all right.

What's cracking?

<i>Yes, I'm looking</i>
<i>for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.</i>

l do not know if
a Mr. Sanders is around.

Who is calling?

<i>My name is Rhonda Glimsher.</i>
<i>I'm a student at Columbia University.</i>

<i>-I'm working on my master's degree.</i>
-Trace it.

<i>-Excuse me? You said ''Master P''?</i>
<i>-Master's degree.</i>

Toronto.

No, wait. Dublin.

No, l got it. Madrid!

He just made a left off 2nd.
Moving east on Canal.

He's going to the docks.

According to this file on Steve,
that's where he makes his pickups.

This way, gentlemen.

l pulled a bust sheet from NYPD
and guess what?

They got an undercover special
going down tonight at Pier 27.

Christ! That stupid son of a bitch
is about to get pinched.

Mobile 3, move in.

Pull over. l'm not doing this.

-Nope.
-l'm going straight.

Pull the car over.

Alvin, you're ex-con.
You just got out of the penitentiary.

You got 26 dollars in your pocket,

<i>-Do not let him make that turn.</i>
-Copy that.

What the hell?!
What's going on?

<i>-What the hell's your problem, man?</i>
<i>-Oh, shit!</i>

Did you jump out a cab and not pay?

Quit talking and drive.

This ain't no Cadillac!

<i>You can 't run into me! This</i>
<i>ain 't no Buick! Do I know you?</i>

-This dude's losing his mind.
-Pull over now! Right now!

-He got a gun.
-To shoot you.

-Don't you have a gun?
-Not with me.

Pull the fucking car over!

Use your finger. Get away!

Come on. You with me?

<i>Come on.</i>

You with me?

Come on.

Can't be a fuck-up all your life.

-He's moving.
-Direction?

North on Jackson Street.

Away from the docks.

Fucking lowlife.

You undercover piece of shit.

Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

That's real funny.

Watch your head.

l think l know why Stevie didn't show.

l think he set us up.

The minute we make bail, he's dead.

Him and his brother, Alvin.

All right, l want every agent
working around the clock. . .

. . .to keep this joker
out of the morgue and out of jail.

He doesn't get so much
as a parking ticket or a hangnail.

From now on, Alvin Sanders
leads a charmed life.

Come on, come on.

Alvin.

Alvin, it's late.

l know, but l really need
to talk to you right now.

l got this for Gregory.

-An egg?
-lt's supposed to be magic.

Anyway, he can't swallow it.

Can l come in?

Just for a minute?

All right, but keep it down.

-The baby's sleeping.
-All right.

<i>Did I ever tell you</i>
<i>that I had a very happy childhood?</i>

<i>-That's not what Stevie says.</i>
<i>-Stevie.</i>

Dad used to pick me up every day
to take the cargo train to Manhattan.

Go to the horse track.
l knew it really well.

l know. Your dad trained horses.

Not really.

No. No, he was a. . . .

He was a groom. l lied about that.

But he was a great groom.
With the thoroughbreds, he was magic.

l say he was the best.
But, you know, job didn't pay shit.

So, therefore, our Christmases,
we didn't get jack shit.

Which really pissed him off.

One day he just went to this toy store
and just stole all these toys.

Robbed them.

Brought the toys over to the crib.

l was like, ''Damn, Santa Claus
got the wrong address or what?''
