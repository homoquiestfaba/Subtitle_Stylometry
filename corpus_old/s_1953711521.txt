That seem to me not the men
King Edward to be.

Pirates.

Sir, the men of the king's following us.

Maybe half a day behind us.
We'll have to hurry.

I know we do not have time for.
This is not our fight.

Those people would return us directly
for the price on our head stands.

You can not blame them because
the king spread nothing but lies about us.

If we have thus interfere
We do not guarantee a safe passage more.

Then we are never in our refuge
in Scotland.

These people are innocent.

But the soldiers of the king.
If we slow down they get us for sure.

We must honor our code.

If people are in danger,
we must protect them.

Who's coming with me?
I.

You can count on me.

I never doubted
my sword ...

countless times to pull
on the shores of distant lands.

But mark my words.
The world has turned against us.

From the edict of the king
that our order it illegal.

This act will give us the same reward
bring as all the other from the past.

It will sorrow and destruction
about us calling.

I have no problem with that.
So be it.

It has not destroyed us, Sigmund.
We are still Fri

And we're still together.
Be thankful for.

There is no time to lose.

Gerald, stay here and look forward
to the warriors of the king.

And the rest ...
Attacks!

Becka, get behind me.
Go to your mother.

I am sorry
It looked pretty nasty.

All the pirates are dead.

And all the villagers are still there.

That is not true. They take,
the orphan girl, included.

My sister swore order
to protect her.

We will need a boat.

Why is it anchored?

Where are the pirates?
There is no one on deck.

Maybe they're all dead.

That we come to know soon enough.
Watch.

It could be an ambush.

There is nobody on board.

It's good. We'll get you out of here.
No.

It is good girl.
You're safe.

I've done something terrible.
What did you say?

You are knights, right?
Soldiers?

Course.
Then I have you all killed.

We're still here, girl.
Let her explain.

I could do nothing else. I thought
there for me no one would come.

That all hope was lost.

I spoke the curse of Anathol out.

All those on board this ship
come and have shed blood ...

are tied to the strength of Anathol
to change in a ...

Stay back.
Protect the girl.

And that should have killed.

Are you telling me that ...
Was one of them.

The pirates.

You have all the pirates in those samples
changed?

Yes.

Why are we still not changed?

Why not?
I still have no wings, do you?

Why can not we change?
I do not know.

But I do know the curse.

All those on board, and blood
have shed into a Gargoyle.

He is changing.
From this ship.

Put him down.

Watch his head.

Hold him.

Forward.
You have to help him.

I'm sorry, I can not.
Damn, witch, why not?

I just learn how to pronounce the curse,
not know how to undo it.

Is there anyone in this town
that can undo the curse?

He's gone mad.
Protect the girl.

I told you that it would not
expire if we would enter the village.

We need context.

Get some context.

It's good.
Gerald.

He's gone mad.

That's not a man. This is an appearance,
risen from the dead.

Even an appearance can not function
without a head.

And what kind of black magic is this?

That girl.
She said something.

It was a curse. One that anger
would generate all of those who are slain.

The pirates.

They will rise from the dead.
In the village.

Stay behind me.

Where did you get this spell?

Where did you get that?

You must tell them.
Of a terrible place.

A magician.

An evil lord, which
a land far to the north reigns.

Which wizard?

I can not say his name.
You must tell them.

He will find me.

They say that if you say his name,
he will find you.

Nobody will find you here.
Who is the magician?

I can not say his name.
You must tell them.

He is known as the black dragon.

Why is he not 'Snowball'
or something?

That does not sound very impressive,
do you?

Maybe we need you
a nickname, 'Sick mind.

State something here that can help us?

The curse can only be broken
by death.

Let me see that.

You're lucky.
There are pictures in.

The little witch.
What have they done to us?

When we are cursed,
why do not we change?

The curse is a seed of pure evil.

If it is located in a bad host,
will grow rapidly.

But if it is a good man,
will have difficulty.

But in all cases, the outcome
same.

Friend or foe,
strong or weak ...

they will all abomination
changing.

This is the curse.
So why the pirates changed so quickly.

The more bad you are,
the faster you change.

For you, maybe. There must be
a way to undo this.

That goes beyond our power.
How much time do we have?

That depends on what happens in each
of you guys. The amount of evil.

There is no harm in me.

That was in Constantinople removed.
Cost me quite a bit too.

And it was not that easy too.
They have the ...

I hope for your sake that's true.

I for one am not going
to wait until I get wings.

Do any of you two person
which can help us to remove the curse?

Someone who knows the ancient arts, perhaps?

A druid?

Maybe I know someone
who can help you.

Where did you learn to fight?
My whole nation can fight.

I grew up on a small island
in the northern sea.

We were often attacked
by the Saxons, the Normans.

After generations of fighting
Intrusion ...

fighting is in our blood.

We had to learn to fight
to defend ourselves.

A real paradise. I do not
why you would want to leave.

That looks like your homeland, Sigmund.
Only friendly.

This is Cavalre?
Yes.

I can not go.

Why not?
I can not enter this place.

Bryce, stay here with the girl.

There were only nine.
Now she was only three.

What happened to the others?
They were arrested by the king ...

because she practiced black magic.

Some say they are stuck
in the Tower of London.

Why would he do that?

They were soothsayers.
Oracles.

They know the old ways.
Witches.

They may not seem powerful,
but do not underestimate them.

They could you, in a moment,
change in a small animal.

What do you mean, a little beast?
Is such a thing be?

Maybe they change us
into a frog or something.

For some of us would
an improvement.

Lady.

These men are soldiers,
but not of the king.

That's right.

You have been to all countries
and now you are not there.

Those who have protected you,
have to leave you now.

There is something else.

You are bewitched by
verachterlijke magic.

They are good.

Can you help them?
There is only one way ...

to remove this curse.

I told them.
Is there perhaps another way?

I can not promise that this is true ...

but those words
of this curse has written ...

he may perhaps break.
The black dragon.

We must do something.
There is one thing that we can try.

Continue.
But you will suffer the consequences.

There is an old saying that I ... we
can use to remove evil.

But there is a chance that spell
not all will work well.

I will do it.

But how do I know it worked?

If it worked,
you are still alive.

No.
He changes.

Do something.

You will see your magic
not use me.

I would not change
in any of these samples.

Stay away from me.

Is he cured?

No.
The magic is too strong.

It's too deep.

It's too deep for me.
I can not break the curse.

There will be taken over by another one.

This is the second of us who changed
almost three.

It starts with a purpose.

But where they fly away?

They are called to him.
Their master.

Then we will look for their master.
The owner of this book.

That black dragon.
And they will bring us going.

She's just a child.

She is strong enough to ship
with pirates to overcome.

The samples will fly to the north.
They feel that it is their master.

Once they feel angry,
they will go to him. The black dragon.

Great is that.

A true sporting prey that gargoyles.
One I hit with three arrows.

The delayed disagree.

It takes more than that
to make a killing.

And you're the expert in this field?

Do you have already slain?
I do.

Long ago, their species
my village.

You must pierce their heart or
their heads chopped off. That's the only way.

So, then let's finish the
gargoyles to you and we can leave.

I'm with you, but not
because the gargoyles.

But in order to protect the girl
A "lady" is enough on this trip.

I did not ask permission.

What if you change all
and there is no one to protect her?

Take as is,
I'm with you.

Then it's settled.
We go to the realm of the black dragon.

I want to know more about the black dragon.

He came to my village
when I was a kid.

The people worshiped him
because he could heal the sick.

He healed the lame
with his magic powders.

They wanted him to stay,
so they gave him land.

But his help was a ruse.

He was looking for a particular stone
which would give him more power.

What does that stone then?
It gives the wearer incredible power.

Power, immortality.
That says it anyway.

Why do they call him the black dragon?

When my people their yoke bore
and rebelled ...

he used the stone
order to summon dragons.

There were seven.
Larger than those gargoyles.

But there is also a huge dragon.
The black dragon.

Yes. It is said that the wizard itself
the black dragon changes.

But anyone who has seen it,
has ever lived to tell.

With the seven dragons and the black dragon
He has my people enslaved.

They dig day and night looking
to the stone.

Is that the book Grim Noire
of the wizard?

Yes.
And you stole it?

Yes.
That was very brave.

I thought that without that book
his dragons could not verify.

And, did he?

I was wrong.

He used them to my village
to attack.

Destroy everything.

We have previously fought with wizards.

They can be very annoying.

You will see that they are a defense,
which comes about by the spell.

But ultimately,
are just men.

Men who may be slain,
like all other men.

Sorry, but we can tonight
no fire.

I know, it would attract too much attention.

I fear that someone following us.

I do not know how this will work.

How can there be a way out of here?

Stay believe, Sigmund.

Believe?
Yes.

It was our belief that our
brought into this mess.

We are left in the lurch.

We are still together?
We fight yet still together?

I trust that woman.
Look at her.

They will probably cut our throats
while we are sleeping.

You look tired, my friend.
Why do not you get some sleep?

I say, let the book return
to the wizard.

And him more strength? Really.

Following amendment to remove the curse.

Are you crazy? No.

He will assume
and he will help us all.

We will not return the book.

You're a monk.

Well, that was me.

Officially we disbanded.

Can you be a monk without water.

He believes not.

But, you never wanted a woman,
a family?

I've never thought about it.

Sorry, I did not mean to offend.

You have not offended me.

I must go now.

I must tell you something.

I can read the old songs.

Read the inscription in the book,
and I make undo the curse.

Do not worry, I will not do it.

I fear that evil
my men overwhelmed.

Even if they do not change,
growing evil in them.

If one of them discovered that ...

Then I will stop them.
Me too.

But if something happens to me,
I can not protect the girl.

You must leave us.
Take the girl tonight.

I see no good end to all this.
Me neither.

Stay away from me.

Kill me!
No!

I would have you both in two heels.

You witch. You did this to us.

You have to pay for.

One move and you're dead.

Sigmund.

Put down your sword.

Was not it you who said that if you change,
you immediately is slain?

Kill me.
He still has not changed.

Brethren, we must remain strong.

We are brothers in arms.
This curse has blinded you.

Put down your sword.

No, it's you who does not see it.
This will solve everything.

Do not.

You, you shot me.

Do not force me to do it.
Go away.

You think you're better than everyone.

Not all ...

but better than you.

I do not want to turn into one of those things.
You do not.

Take.
Stay with him.

This will hurt.

Protect the girl.
We will, together.

I do not think so.

Thank you.

We must apparently a dragon hunt.
Yes.

I do not think the boy can travel.

I'm with you.

We can not go.

Not in this area.

We will the rest of the way to walk.

Attacks!

We will not go on this ground save.

I'll get them.
How can you, in that state?

I can do it.

I see myself still not save
to those mountains.

Please give this to take,
if you find her.

Course.
You can tell her ...

that if I ever see her,
I've left the order.

They will understand what I mean.
Okay.

It seems they look for saltpetre.

What is that?
It is the weapon of the Mongols.

What brings you to Cataradreus?
Who's in charge of this camp?

These travelers want to talk to you.
-Please, take a drink.

What bring two knights and a ...
to our glorious kingdom?

I have long dreamed about the fall
of the black dragon.

You have three fighters.
You have your men.

We will fight.
I will lead them.

I can not imagine the punishment
this village are honored ...

if we fortress on the mountain attacks.

So you would rather be a slave of the magician?

Do not talk to me about compromises.

You know nothing of the good people who used
tried to defeat the dragon and died.

You can not imagine his strength.

He crushed us.

Take it was one of your people, right?
Please.

They brought us the greatest misery.

She was the favorite of the wizard.
His disciple.

When they departed,
she left us.

And hell came down on us.

If it is held by him,
then so be it.

You can not beat the wizard.

He has seven dragons at his disposal.

The eighth, the black dragon,
which will destroy us all.

You might have something here,
to fight against the dragon.

Like what?
The substance they dig.

All material found
must add to the wizard.

Then you will not fight.
No.

You're wrong.

I can not allow you
the fortress on the hill to attack.

If you do, the anger of the magician
this village portion.

For those who do not want to die,
now is the time to go.

The rest of you, get your gun,
because your time has come.

There are only three of you,
Look at us, what you gonna do?

We need a diversion.

I Mongols who Weapons yet.

What do you need?

Some salt, Peter.

Leave that to me.

Thank you.

This may be bloody.

I beg you, let's fight with pride.
If you still can.

Can I?

And this is nothing personal.

I wanted to let you know.

If someone attacks me with a gun ...

I simply kill.

What is that?
A hand grenade.

I have 16 horses exchanged
for this beauty, with a Mongol.

Come on, hurry up.

This will be a bigger explosion.

Now we have to run, come on.

There goes the seventh.
We'll never get there?

There is another input.

There she is.
Please.

Hello.

Do not worry, it'll be fine.
We'll pick you up.

How do we get her out?

That's a very good question.

But a better question would be,
how did you get here ...

alive.
Show yourself.

Why would I do that?

If you like to see,
only evil intentions.

We just want the girl.
I think you want something different, or not?

You want them to break the curse,
which they have called you.

At this time I want to kill you
and move on.

Give it your best shot.

An appearance.

Maybe it's a manifestation
someone in another place.

Do not you want to know how you
can cure yourself?

It's very simple.

If you read the book carefully, is all
you should do "kill the girl."

And you will be free from the curse.

Is that true?
Yes.

You should choose
or you want to change your destiny.

Kill me, I deserve to die.
Can you hear it, they will die.

You must do it.

The wizard is near. His form of magic
can not be done from afar.

Follow me.

The puzzle is now together.

The reason the people to nitric
the graves.

I am sure that the same substance is
what is the elixir of life should be.

The magician is, physically speaking, I think,
in poor health.

We look for him and then we kill him.

If you leave this room,
then you will die.

We will all die once.
But today it's your turn to die.

Our destiny beyond the thousand deaths,
will defeat us. As you move forward.

You will never break your curse,
if you murder me.

I am the only one who has the key.

You can not kill me.
I am immortal.

My mind does not exist,
inside said reservoir.

I guess we'll find out.

Do it!

Where is the wizard go?

He can materialize our body, which goes
not fast, and often can not be done.

We gotta get her out of there.
I have an idea.

Lie down in the cage.

Come, do not worry.

Hold on tight and do not look down.

Come on, that's good.

It's all right, come on.
Quickly, we have not much time.

That's it.

It's all right, lady.
I got you.

Where is Maldwyn?

I am sorry
No.

Go!

What is that?
Old-fashioned Chinese Medicine.

This works best.
Cover your ears.

Go.

Maldwyn.

Come on.
No, Maldwyn.

Go.

Maldwyn.
Come on.

Stop fighting, now.

This way.

Come on.

We can not cover.
There must be something we can do.

The saltpeter.
We lure him back to the mine.

I go along.
No, stay here and protect the people.

Come on, beast.

Give me the book. That he wants.
It will distract him.

Come on.
Here it is.

Thank you.

I had the strangest dream ever.
Me too.

My brother.

I found you nice in a form
of a Gargoyle.

Large, tough beast that you were.
