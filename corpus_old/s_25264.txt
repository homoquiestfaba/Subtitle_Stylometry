1.567 makes it
8 degrees.

Man: Altair,
Alpha Centauri, Sirius.

Leo: Matt Shepherd?

It's just a party,
and he asked me.

He's really nice.

Yeah, to you, maybe.

You guys getting some
good work done over here?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah, sounds like it.

What's the bright one?

Uh...

Mizar.
It's a double star.

Good.
The one next to it?

Uh...

Alcor.

Good, Biederman,
and the one next to that?

Uh...

I don't know.

It's Megrez.

I don't think so.

Well, you just said
you didn't know.

Well,
it's not Megrez.

It's something else.

Look.

It's south
about 10 degrees.

It's probably
a satellite.

Let's take
another picture.

We'll send it
to Dr Wolf.

Yes, sir.

It's Megrez.

Not Megrez.

It is.

It's not.

It is.




Hmm.

Hmm.

Hmm.

Well, hello there,
little fella.

Do I know you?

Where are you going
in such a hurry?

And there.


Come on.

Damn it!

Biederman.

Come on, you miserable
piece of crap.

Randy Travis On Radio:
* Still on the bottom *

Come on, come on.

press that number now.

Damn it!

This is relating
to the recall

of American troops
from abroad.

Tragedy struck today
as a charter aircraft

carrying an army unit
returning from duty in Japan

crashed this morning...

Stuart Caley:
White House Press Office

says Secretary of
the Treasury Rittenhouse

is resigning because
his wife is sick.

So who passed
Rittenhouse the hemlock?

AFL/CIO wanted him offthe
Council of Economic Advisors

for not supporting
the pension bill,

and the president's going
to need labour next fall.

And State's still fuming

about the trade office
screw-up at the G-8.

Pentagon is unhappy with his
readiness reduction proposals.

Beth: Greenspan
dislikes him.

Christ, who didn't
this guy piss off?

No wonder
the wife's sick.

Jenny Lerner: She's not sick,
she's a drunk.

How do you know that?

Mike Woodward
over at Treasury.

Mrs Rittenhouse started
drinking a couple of years ago

when her husband
had a series of affairs.

Stepped it up last summer after
their son died of leukaemia.

You want to do something on
the price that wives pay?

Mike Woodward?
Wife, 3 kids?

He's been after me
for months.

So I threw him
a breakfast

and hit him up
about Rittenhouse.

Bob Campbell's leaving,
so midnight Saturday

anchor shift
is opening up.

Why would I want
to give up the White House

for a graveyard weekend--

No, no, no,
not for you, for me.

No.

Beth.

We'll talk
about this later.

Very calm. The president will be
back from Camp David tomorrow.

Business news, Ira.

Just keep working
on Rittenhouse.

Maybe Mike's available
for dinner.

Do the usual research,
background information.

OK, that's it.

Beth, wait.

Listen, Beth, what if
it wasn't permanent?

Oh, God,
Jenny, please.

Honey, this
is how it works.

You've done 2 years
of research.

Now do 3 as
a segment producer.

5 on air doing
domestic features,

another 2 in some
cholera-ridden hell hole.

And then I'll quit

if they don't give you
a weekend anchor shot.

Hello, Caitlin.
There you are.

Are you protecting me
or just holding me back?

Yes.
OK.

Rittenhouse tape and text

on my desk by 4:00 tomorrow,

and we'll drop in
the reverses for the 5.

OK.

At this moment right now--

thank you--

The pretty little girls
are walking down the aisle.

They're spreading flowers.

The twins.
What are their names?

Emma and Susanna.

They're walking
down the aisles,

and they're dropping
rose petals,

and everyone's
smiling at them,

and now she's walking
down the aisle.

Yes, and she stands
beside him.

And the priest says,
"Dearly beloved--"

Judge.

The judge says,
"Blah, blah, blah.

Sickness and health,
blah, blah, blah.

Do you,Jason Lerner, take
Chlorine Whatchamacallit?"

Mom, Chloe.

What did I say?

You said "Chlorine."

Her name's Chloe.

Oh.

Well, it's still
a terrible name.

Jason says, "Lie, lie, lie,
till death do us part,

blah, blah, blah,"

and she says yes,
and he says yes,

and it's kissy, kissy, kissy,
and congratulations.

Jenny, you now have
a new stepmother

who is 2 years older
than you.

The check.

Well, anyway,

as much as I'd like
to stay here

and get silly
with you, Mom,

I can't.
I gotta go.

I know, I know, I know.

I'm sorry about this.

We'll get over it.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Be good.

I was with the secretary

since he's been governor
of Connecticut.

I came to Washington
with him.

I moved here because I was
dedicated to his career.

I trusted the man...

and then he fucked me.

He what?

No, I didn't
have sex with him.

I should say / didn't
have sex with him,

but somebody sure did.

It was about to come out,
so he resigned.

But because I was hired from
outside the government pool,

I don't get conveyed
to the next secretary,

so now I'm out a job...

Because he couldn't
keep his hands off women.

Do you have proof?

He thinks he was
being so clever.

He had a private phone line
installed in his office.

Nobody else could answer it.

I picked it up once.

Said hello,
and it's nobody home.

It rings, he shuts the door.

Why not hang a sign?

Do you have a name?

This is what I get

for talking to the press.

I'm selling my soul
right now.

I can feel it.
I can feel it.

I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

So you do have a name.

Just a first name.

Oh, my God.
I'm going to say it.

Ellie.

Ellie. Nothing else?

I think the president
knows about it, too.

Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.

Isn't Washington sick?

Hi.

How you doing?

Can I help you?

Well, actually,

we're looking
for your mom.

Is she around?

My mom's sick.
She's not here.

Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

Yeah.

That's exciting. Looks
like a long trip, huh?

So, listen, do you know
where you're going?

Rittenhouse: She's going
back to the house.

Hey, you want to stop that?

Lily, please.

Lily, that's a pretty name.

Lily.

Do as I say.
Go on.

If we could just get
a minute of your time.

What do you want from me?

We'd like to talk
about your resignation.

My wife is sick.
She's in the hospital.

That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

We could talk
about your wife,

or we could just
talk about Ellie.

Turn the camera off.

If you want to talk to me,
turn it off.

We know everything.

Nobody knows everything.

Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

and the whispered calls
to the president

and about a secretary
of the Treasury

who's kept his entire
department in the dark

about what
he's really doing--

about a cover story
about his resignation

that just fell through.

You want me to go on?

And you're
just gonna break it?

Well, that's what we do
for a living.

Well, congratulations.

You now have
the biggest story in history.

Good luck to you.

Personally...

I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

but hey, what the hell?

Why not?

What difference
does anything make any more?

Look.

I know you'rejust a reporter,

but you used to be
a person, right?

I wanted to be with my family.

Can you understand that?

OK, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

resigns because of a mistress
named Ellie.

The biggest story
in history?

What an ego.

Now, if it was
the president--

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The president
has a mistress named Ellie,

and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

and takes the fall and resigns,

and the president
buys him a yacht?


Son of a bitch.

Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.

Right! OK, OK!

Oh, God. Oh, God.

FBI. If you would,
please, ma'am.

What do I do
with my car?

We'll take care
of your car.

Just step back
to my car.

Get her car here.

Let's go.


Would you
come this way please?

Morton Entrekin, Ms Lerner.

I'm expected
back at MSNBC at 6:00.

I think
I should be there.

People knew about the Manhattan
Project, you know,

and they kept it a secret.

That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

Hmm.


Ms Lerner, Tom Beck.

I understand you've come
into some information.

Ms Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

for matters
of national security

where journalistic
competitiveness is at stake.

Mr President,
I'm not interested

in using Ellie to
further my career.

What do you know
about E.L.E.?

I know you should have
picked a better cover story

than a sick wife.

See?

What did I tell you?

We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

was the publication
of the budget,

since we've spent
more money than we can hide.

The budget comes out
in 2 weeks.

I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for 2 weeks.

No such thing as 2 weeks
in the news business.

And I can't appeal
to your sense

of what's in the nation's
best interest?

I always thought
the truth

was in the nation's
best interest.

Entrekin:
You want to hold her?

What if we go public
in 48 hours?

Now that's doable,
isn't it?

Entrekin: That would be very
difficult, Mr President.

Morton, if she knows,
how long can it be

before CNN or the Post
breaks the story?

This was never
gonna be a secret

as long as you wanted
it to be.

Give us 2 days, Ms Lerner.

You'll get second row,
centre,

at the White House
press conference.

Now, from what I know of your
career, that's a promotion.

I want exclusivity.

Now, listen, young lady.

This is a presidential favour.

I'm letting you go

because I don't want
another headache.

And I'm trusting you

because I know what this
can do for your career.

It might seem
that we have each other

over the same barrel,
Ms Lerner,

but it just seems that way.

I want--

Want?

May I...

May I have
the first question?

We'll see you Tuesday,
Ms Lerner.

Come on, come on.

E.L.E., E.L.E.

Paleontology?

Paleontology?

What's paleontology
have to do with anything?

Come on.

Beth: Hey.

Hey.

Look who's working late.

How's Rittenhouse going?

No sign of the wife yet.

Is she missing?

No. We're still
working on it.

We'll get there.

I know,
it's a dull story.

Next time we'll get you
something more exciting.

Great.

Are you OK?

Yeah.

Want to come
to dinner with us?

I can't.
I have plans.

OK. We'll see you tomorrow.

Jenny: Thank you.

Ah, here she is.

Jenny.

Hello.

Hi, Chloe.

Waiter: Would you like
some champagne, miss?

Martini...big.

I missed you.

I mean we missed you
yesterday.

I must say, I'm...

I'm disturbed that
you didn't come

to our wedding.

Jason, you
promised.

I know I promised,

but it was
a beautiful event,

and I missed her.

You should have been there.

The twins, they were
running around like mad

and throwing flowers.

It was wonderful,
especially Emma.

You know, the little one.
She loves you.

It was beautiful.

She missed you, too.

All right.

This is from us
for you.

Are you not
going to open it?

I knew she wouldn't...

You can exchange them
if you don't like them.

Jenny,
I know this is hard.

I just want you
to be happy.

Happy.

Well,

I would like to propose
a toast to happiness

and to--

Mmm.

Mmm.

Are we going to have
an evening or not?

Jenny, I know
that you hate me.

I know that you have
terrible things

that you want
to say to me.

You have
to get over it.

Life goes on.

Jenny: Life goes on? OK.


What's so funny?

Life...

We'll see.

What's so funny
about "life goes on"?

Life going on?

I don't think it's funny
that life goes on.

Dad, you need to get
back together with Mom.

She's all alone in the world,
and she needs you right now.

OK?

Jenny.

I just got married.

I know, and I'm sorry.

Chloe, this has nothing
to do with you.

Jason: Well, it has
to do something for me,

for Christ's sake.

This is insane.

I have to apologize
for my daughter.

It's not your fault.

I'm sorry.
I have to go.

I know you think
I'm a bad person.

I'm really not.

And I don't hate you.

I just--I gotta go.


'Cause for her, it doesn't--
Excuse me.

Jenny. Hey.

What are you doing here?

Uh, yeah.

Did Stuart send you here
without telling me?

No.

If Stuart thinks he can push
me out of the White House--

Ms Lerner.
Hi, Beth.

Right this way.

I've got you
right down here.

Excuse me, please.

OK.

He'll find you
for the first question.

Then you're on your own.

Hey, how are you?

Press Secretary:
Ladies and gentlemen.

Ladies and gentlemen,

please.

The president will begin
by addressing the nation.

Please hold your questions
until he's finished his remarks.

Ladies and gentlemen,

the President
of the United States.

Hello, everybody.

Mr President.
Hello.

Man: 10 seconds,
Mr President.

5, 4.

Good evening.

A few minutes ago
the United States ambassadors

to every country
in the world

told the leaders
of those nations

what I am about
to tell you.

It's a bit complicated,
so it will take some time,

so I hope
you will bear with me,

hear what I have to say.

A little over a year ago,

2 American astronomers,
Marcus Wolfand Leo Biederman,

working on a mountain top
in Arizona...

Shh.

Nobody say
anything.

saw something
in the night sky

that caused them
great concern.

A comet.

But the comet was, well...

There was a remote possibility
that the comet was on a path

that could bring it into
direct contact with the Earth.


Now...

we get hit all the time
by rocks and meteors,

some of them the size of cars,
some no bigger than your hand.

But the comet we discovered
is the size of New York City.

From the north side
of Central Park to the Battery.

About 7 miles long.

Put another way,

this comet is larger
than Mount Everest.

It weighs 500 billion tons.

Now, chances are...

Astrophysicists, geologists
and climatologists.

Where the hell
is Science?

Check with Tokyo, Tel Aviv.
I want everybody.

The Hale-Bopp stand-ups.

Graphics!
I need graphics!

President Beck: Comets begin
far out in space.

They're what's left over

from the creation
of the solar system

after the planets were formed
billions of years ago.

These chunks
of space debris

are in an elongated orbit
around our sun,

but every now and then

one of them gets bumped

like a billiard ball
on a pool table

and is knocked
into a different orbit.

If this comet continues
on its path around the sun

and keeps
its present course,

sometime on August 16,
roughly a year from now,

there's a chance
that we might have impact.

So for the past 8 months,
the United States and Russia

have been building the largest
spaceship ever constructed.

It's being built in orbit
around the Earth.

And we call it the Messiah.

Right now a team of American
astronauts and one Russian

are at Cape Canaveral
in Florida.

In 2 months, they will leave
on the shuttle Atlantis

to board the Messiah.

This is the crew
that will stop the comet.

I'd like the world to meet
some extraordinary people.

First is Mission Commander
Oren Monash.

Commander, would you introduce
us to your team?

I'd be honoured, sir.

Pilot Andrea Baker.

Medical Officer

Gus Partenza.

From Russia,
nuclear specialist

Colonel Mikhail
Tulchinsky.

Navigator
Mark Simon

and Rendezvous Pilot
Spurgeon Tanner.

Hello,
Mr President.

Captain Tanner,
you flew 6 shuttle missions.

You were the last man to walk
on the moon, weren't you?

Yes, sir,

but Oren here
will be doing

most of the flying
on this one.

I'll just
be taking us down

to the comet's
surface.

Well, it's good to know
we're going to have

your kind of experience
up there, Captain.

Tanner:
thank you, sir.

Godspeed to you all.

We're counting on you.

thank you, sir.

Got Beijing, Rome,
Sao Paulo, Cairo, Berlin!

Does anyone know how big
the one was

that killed
all the dinosaurs?

Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the intro

and a theme
for the longer promos.

You want it hitting
the goddam Earth?

Well, that's what he's saying.
Bring that up again.

It'll scare the shit
out of them.

Beck: We will not tolerate any
disruption ofour way of life.

Our society will
continue as normal.

Work will go on.
You will pay your bills.


There will be no hoarding.

There will be
no sudden profiteering.

I'm freezing all wages,
all prices.

What a bottle of water
cost you yesterday...

it will cost you tomorrow.

Now we'll take
a few questions.

Reporters: Mr President!

Ms Lerner.

Ahem.

Ahem. Uh,Jenny Lerner,
M--MSNBC.

Jenny Lerner?

Son of a bitch.

Um, Mr President,

why wasn't this announcement
made sooner?

Well, until we knew
we could build the rocket

and the comet
could be intercepted,

we saw no reason
to alarm the planet.

Sir!
Mr President!

Do you have another
question, Ms Lerner?

Yeah. Um...

Is--Is there a connection
between the comet

and the recall of American
troops from abroad?

Beck: Our fighting men
and women are coming home

because we felt it prudent,

in light of domestic
security concerns,

to have them available.

Although I certainly hope
we don't need to use them.

Next question.

Reporters: Mr President!

Actually, Mr President,

if--just one final
question, sir. Um...

MSNBC has learned that
Secretary Rittenhouse

did not leave
for the reasons

announced by
your administration.

In fact,
isn't it true, sir,

that not everyone
in your administration

is convinced that the
Messiah will save us?

Secretary Rittenhouse served
his country with full devotion.

He resigned
for personal reasons.

Now, I can promise you this,
Ms Lerner, all of you,

everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

that at some point
over the next 10 months,

all of us will entertain
our worst fears and concerns.

But I can also
promise you this.

Life will go on.

We will prevail.

Mr President!
Please!

Beck: Sally.

Sir, what is
the comet's name?

The 2 scientists
who found the comet

were killed in a car crash

while racing from their
observatory to alert the world.

So we named it for them.

Wolf-Biederman.

Leo Biederman,
they said it again.

Shh!

Leo, is he talking
about you?

He is, isn't he?


Can you get that,
please?


Janie, get the door.

Beck: Well, we have the
technology to build the ship.

They have the technology
to make it go.

There's someone at
the door for you, Leo.


Newscaster: You've been
watching live coverage

of President Tom Beck...

I can't believe this.
This is so weird.

Dr Wolf
from Astronomy Club?

Yeah, I guess so.

I think
it's really neat.

Nobody on our block

discovered the world
was gonna end before.

Dan: He's still
very much alive.

He's still alive, everyone.

He's right here,
and he's still alive.

OK?

Child:
Hey, Leo, cool!

Leo: As far as we know,

what happened was
that Doctor Wolf

saw the comet
in my photograph,

so he shared
the discovery with me,

and then he was killed
in that crash

and everything got
mixed up in Washington,

so the president
thought I was dead, too.

Leo!
Leo!

Jasmine.

How does it feel
having your name on it?

I don't want anyone to think

that I'm trying to take
something away from Dr Wolf,

because I'm not,
but it's kind of cool.

Leo!
Leo!

Jason.

You know, you're gonna
have sex a lot more now

than anyone else
in our class.


Don't listen. Don't.

Really?

thank you for your sexual
insight, Mr Thurman.

You can sit down now.

Famous people always
get sex, Mr Perry.

That's the main reason
it's good to be famous.


Fruit--a reactor,
bottle--a rocket, OK?

A nuclear reactor
in space?

Yes.

Isn't that dangerous?

No, no, no. This is
all Russian design.

Russian science.

Uh, the same people
who designed Chernobyl.

Chernobyl?

Chernobyl almost worked.

[Song Playing ln Background]
* Fly me to the moon *

So what happens
after you plant the bomb?

Well, we have 7 hours.

We're gonna put the
bombs inside the comet.

I'm gonna follow
these two.

I don't trust
that combination.

After 7 hours,
the 14-hour rotational cycle

of the comet spins.

We're gonna get married.

God knows I want
to marry you,

but the day I get back,

the last thing I'm gonna do
is step inside of a church.

I don't do churches well.

'Cause there's only
7 hours of darkness.

Then the sun starts hitting
the surface of the planet...

These are your orders.

Upon first entering
Earth's atmosphere,

proceed immediately
up the exterior

of the mother ship.

When the sun
hits the surface,

there's gonna be
explosive outgassings

that are
very dangerous--

Gus, he's 7.

Brittany.

You boys were, what,

4 and 6 when I went
to the moon?

Yeah.

Now, you saw me go into space
7 times, didn't ya?

I came back every time,
didn't I?

Yeah.

Your mother and I used to play
a game when she was still alive.

Now, the game was,

if there was a chance
I might not be coming back,

she wouldn't say it,
and I wouldn't say it.

OK?

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

Otis Hefter:
Hey, Fish.

How about
a beer?

You remember my boys,
don't you?

Steve and Dwight.

Of course I do.

Gentlemen,
welcome to Houston.

Let me steal
your old man for a second.

Can I take your
picture, please?

OK.

thank you.

So, what do you
think of the crew?

Heroes all.

That's the finest group
I ever had the privilege

of working with.

Yeah, yeah.

Off the record, huh?

Well, they've been trained
in ways I'll never understand.

They're smarter
and in better shape

than we ever were
in the old days.

They're sober, serious.

I guess I'd be a little happier
about this whole thing

if I thought that any of them
were as scared as I am.

Well, they're not
scared of dyin'.

They're just scared
of looking bad on TV.

Now, look, I wish
I'd been to the moon.

I got respect for everybody
who's gone to the moon,

but this mission
ain't going to the moon.

That's right.
Frank Gifford,

he was a great football
player in his time,

but if he played now,
he'd get his ass busted.

Simon: That's right.


All I'm saying is,
the moon did not have

a rotational cycle
of 14 hours.

I mean, we only have
7 hours ofdark

when the sun's not up
to land on this thing.

It was light
when he landed.

This is gonna be dark.

We're not gonna
be able to see.

You can't see now, Gus.

Tulchinsky: Don't worry,
don't worry, don't worry.


We what?

We can do it.


No, no, no. Sit down.

I woke up this morning,
and I realized...

none of you
want me here.

You don't even really know
who I am, which is OK.

I walked on the moon,

but I didn't belong to you.
I belonged to your daddies.

Now, if I ask you
to ask your daddies

what I meant to them,

to explain to you
what I'm doing here,

that's only gonna
make things worse.

So...what do we do?

You haven't trained
for this mission.

We respect you.

I appreciate that.

But you're here...you're here
because the powers that be

think we need a familiar
face on this trip.

You're here
for public relations.

No, no. I'm here because
the powers that be

know that I'm the only
person on this mission

who's ever landed
on the moon.

And I have 500 landings
on aircraft carriers.

We've trained on--

On flight
simulators.

Right?

I mean, this is
not a video game, son.

It really isn't.


It really isn't. No.

NASA Announcer: We are go
for auto-sequence start.

Atlantis' 4 on-board computers
now have primary control

of all the vehicle's
critical functions.

Hefter:
OK, all flight controllers,

we're at T-minus 30 seconds
and counting.

Let's take a close look.

APUs look good,

LOX and LH2
are pressurized.

Announcer: 1 0, 9...

Assistant Flight Director:
We're go for auto-sequence.

Hefter: Roger,Jerry.

Good luck
and Godspeed, Atlantis.

Monash: Thanks, Mitch.

Announcer: 3, 2, 1.

Anchorman: Propelled by 500,000
pounds of liquid fuel,

the shuttle crew heads toward
their initial destination.

When the crew
enters the Messiah,

they will find a payload
of 8 nuclear devices

that will eventually be
used to blow up the comet.

The Messiah itself
will be powered

by an experimental
nuclear propulsion system

that was originally created

for a very
different purpose.

That programme
was called Orion.

Now, with the help
of Russian engineers,

a technology designed to propel
weapons of mass destruction

will power the ship
that will intercept

the greatest threat
our planet has ever faced.

Tulchinsky:
Orion burn...

in 10, 9,

8, 7,

6, 5,

4, 3,

2, 1 , 0.

OK, Beth,
White House reactions.

Marianne,
the whole world watching.

We have enough
satellite space?

78 uplinks.

Tim, Mission Control
in Houston.

Ira, the science guys
lined up?

If they got a Ph.D.,
we own them.

All right, this is the most
important story of our lives.

Let's not muck it up.

Stuart,
what about me?

You're on the anchor desk.
Whoa!

And you could have
been there a lot sooner.

What are you
talking about?

You know what
I'm talking about.

Don't ever hold back
a story from me again.

Hefter: Messiah, Houston.

Transfer trajectory is go.

We'll cancel MCC-1 .

You're go
to configure for coast.

Roger, Houston, we're
looking good here.

Jesus, that's big.

Holy shit.


Partenza: Wow.

Sweet mother of God.

Assistant Flight Director:
All circuit breakers are open.

Master arm is off.

Monash: Roger.

And the detonator
system is safe.

Hefter: Messiah, Houston.

Stand by for an uplink
of the final mole coordinates.

Confirm when complete.

Monash: Wilco, Houston.

Hey, how's it comin'?

Baker: Loading
first nuke now.

Baker: 1,000 feet
to stand-off.

R-dot 3, 5-X, 2-Y.

500 feet,

R-dot point 3...3-X,

1 point 5-Y.

Go for auto trajectory.

We're there.

Monash:
Residuals are nulled.

Baker:
Disengage Orion.

Orion disengaged.

You're on bi-prop.

Announcer: This is
a special presentation

of MSNBC News

with Jenny Lerner.

Good evening.

Sometime in the next hour,

the Messiah mission will
enter its most critical phase:

the interception
of Wolf-Biederman

and the setting of
the nuclear devices

that will deflect it off
its collision course with Earth.

But first,
Captain Spurgeon Tanner

will have to guide
the spacecraft

through the blizzard
of rocks, sand, and ice

that make up
the comet's tail, or coma.

The crew will have to complete
its work before the sun rises.

Sublimator
looks good, Mick.

Tanner, Over lntercom:
Disengaging auto now.

I'm eyeballs out
from here on in.

How come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

Tanner: I heard that.

Lights on.

Cameras on.

Tanner: On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

there were riverboat pilots

who only knew a few miles
of the river.

I mean, conditions
changed so much,

you couldn't
know the whole trip.

Floods, sandbars,
fallen logs--

It was all a riverboat pilot
could do

was to know his little
piece of the puzzle.

So for the next few hours,
this is my ship.

We start our approach.

Jenny:
...are images from cameras

mounted inside the cargo bay
of the Messiah.

Now, these images are delayed
by approximately 20 seconds,

due to the distance
they must travel.

OK, you can see that the image
is breaking up a bit.

Uh, Houston is prepared
for this.

They've informed us that
due to the uncertain make-up

of the comet's coma,

they're unsure whether or not
transmission will be possible.

OK, now, now, it ap-appears
we're losing reception here.

OK, we've--we've
lost picture now.

But we will stay on the air.

We'll stay with you
through all of this.

Baker, Over lntercom:
Prop 96%.

Dap is in descent.

Tanner, Over lntercom:
Roger, descent.


Oh, my God.

Baker: Look at these.
They're the size of houses.

Yeah, I know.

I see.

Jesus Christ.

Baker: Prop, 88%.


Baker: Cabin press, 5.7.

Negative guidance errors.

Whoa!

Tanner: Use your
primary thrusters.

Baker: Primary thrusters.

What's the descent rate?

3 feet per second. 2.

Fire tether pitons.

Pitons fired.

She's levelling out.


Baker:
Depressurizing bay.

Tanner: Opening
payload doors.

Don't let that little bit
of gravity down there

go to your heads.

OK.

Start the clock.

Jenny: I fall is going
according to schedule,

the astronauts should
now be placing the moles

on the comet surface.

The moles are, well,
they're what they sound like.

They are drilling machines

that burrow
to a depth of 100 metres,

where they wait
to be detonated.

Each one carries
a 5,000 kiloton warhead.

How's our time?

It's getting tight.
1:36:30.

It's taking too long.

Yup.

What happens if
they do not get off

the comet's surface
in time?

The sun striking the comet
will cause the temperature

to rise 350 degrees
in just a few minutes

and activate
the high-speed gasjets.

Well, if that happens,

it will be like trying
to work in a minefield.

Tanner: Mark, what's
your mole 4 readout?

Simon: Mole 4
running true at 75 feet.


Son of a bitch.

Simon: What?

It's stuck.

Try backing it up.

Baker: What's your depth?

75 feet.

Is that enough?

No. That'll just break
pieces off the surface.

That's not
deep enough.

Yeah, Fish, I know
that's not deep enough.

I'm going in.

Simon: Oren, no.

Monash: No, I'm gonna see
if I can free it up.

Stand by,
tether attached.

All right, I gotcha.

Baker: Oren,
suit pressure, 3.5.

Simon:
Come on, come on.

How's my time?

Tanner: 23:57.

Another 6 minutes, they won't
have time to get back to us.

Blow the tethers.
Let's go get 'em.

If we go after them,

we may not have enough fuel
to get off the surface.

Blow the goddam tethers.

Mole 3 at depth.

We're heading
your way, Oren.

Tanner: Calculate exactly
how much prop we need

to get off this rock.

We'll shut it down
when we hit it.

Will do.

It opens up
into a cave down here.

Mole got jammed
against the side.

Partenza: OK, Fish,
team 2 at location 4.

Give me your hand.

What the hell happened?

I don't know.
I don't know.

Everything
was going great,

and we got jammed
up at 75 feet.

OK, hold up.

Monash: All right,
try backing it up.

Roger that.

That's it.
A little more.

Shut it down.

No, they always put
extra in these tanks.

Fish, shut it down.

OK.

Come on, you bastard!
Come on! Time!

1:02.

Figured we'd better pick
you kids up after school.

Checkyour 6,
1 00 yards.

Partenza: I think we'd
better hurry, boys.

All right, it's going!
It's going!

Mole's at 125 feet.

The sun's rising behind you.
It's coming up fast.

Face shields down!

Oh, Christ!

Get the hell
out of there!


Aah!

Tanner: Oren, get
your visor down.

Get your visor down!


Oh! My eyes!

Ohh!

Simon:
All right, we got him.

Monash: Oh, God!
My eyes!


Baker: Oh, God,
we're losing one.

He's got escape velocity.
1,000 feet and climbing.

Aah!

Mark, Mikhail, get
the hell out of there!

Tanner: Firing
primary thrusters.

Payload doors
still open.

Close 'em as we go.

Tanner, Over Speaker:
Houston, all moles are at depth.

Nukes hot and ready.

We lost Partenza
to explosive outgassing.

And Monash is injured.

We have to go get Gus.

Tanner: There's
no time for that.

Repressurize
the cargo bay.

He's going to die out there!

We can still find him.
He has a beacon.

I don't have time
to argue with you.

Just sit down
and be quiet.

Turn on
the fuckin' locator!

We've used most
of our propellant

to get us out
of the coma.

We can't just leave him.
We have to go back!

If we go back for Gus,
we all die.

We can't just
leave him in space!

Sit down, Mick.
Sit down.

It's OK.

Jenny: The Messiah has safely
lifted off the comet.

But sadly,
Gus Partenza has been lost.

Gus Partenza, a native of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

and graduate of
Carnegie-Mellon University,

joined the NASA
Space Programme

shortly after completing
his medical training

at Duke University.

Dr Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission,

not only for his
medical expertise,

but also for his dedication

to the advancement
of space technology.

Yeah.

With the loss
of Dr Gus Partenza

and with Oren Monash
injured,

Captain Spurgeon Tanner
is now in charge of the mission.

The Messiah
has successfully docked

with the Orion-powered
boosters

and is now prepared
to detonate

the bombs planted
on Wolf-Biederman.

The Messiah's
exterior-mounted camera

will show us the detonation,

but not before being
temporarily blocked out

by the nuclear blast.

Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,

so when the picture
comes back to us,

the comet should already
have been knocked off

its present course.

Tanner: Prepare to remove
safeties and fire.

Tulchinsky:
Safeties removed.

Weapons armed.


3, 2, 1 ...

Now.

Jenny:
So now we're just waiting

for the picture
to come back.

Decompression in area 6.


Simon: Mick!

I'll get the halon!

Aah!


Man: Yes.
I'm still here.
