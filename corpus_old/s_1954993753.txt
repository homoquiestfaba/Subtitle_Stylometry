<i>Thank you.</i>

I got you.

<i>So this woman,</i>
<i>you know, she's flirting,</i>

asking all these questions.

You know, she came
to buy a tree,

but suddenly she's less
and less interested.

So, she convinces him
to sneak away for a minute.

<i>So they go behind the stand.</i>

<i>There's like this little alley</i>
<i>behind the building.</i>

Boom, she goes down on him.

He's sitting there,
this freezing ass cold night

suddenly ain't so bad, right?

Gettin' head from this beautiful
girl, starring up at the stars.

<i>So, he finishes and all of a</i>
<i>sudden she gets all embarrassed</i>

and then she runs away.

And he doesn't
really think about it,

he just walks back to the stand,
gleaming, you know?

He gets back,
all the trees are gone.

<i>Shut up.</i>

<i>Every single one of 'em, empty.</i>

Wow, even the who-hash.

<i>Oh, hi.</i>
<i>How much are those wreaths?</i>

<i>The small ones are $10,</i>
<i>the big ones are $20.</i>

How big are the smalls?

That's a small.

Yeah, that's good.

That works?
Yeah.

All right, anything else?
No, thanks.

All right.

I'm gonna finish up
the lights out here.

<i>It smells so good.</i>

Hey guys, lights are done.

Yo, it's not a bad
night's sleep in there.

If you say so.

Two sixteen-inch wreaths
and a daddy burger swag.

I like this.

Look at this, this is round.
It feels good.

Hey, how you doing?
Hey.

How much for this one?
Sixty.

And that one?
Also $60.

Yeah, these are all
the same trees, same height.

So, what do you think.

Oh, it's kinda big.

I don't think we have
that much room.

What are you talking about?
We got 8-foot ceilings.

We do?
We bought from you last year.

<i>Oh, great.</i>

<i>Is that nice girl</i>
<i>still working here?</i>

Not this year.

You sell the bases?
Yep, stands.

Yeah, how much are they?
$20.

Let's go for it.

Yeah?
Yeah.

<i>Do we have those lights</i>
<i>from last year?</i>

<i>Oh yeah, they're</i>
<i>in a box in the closet,</i>

<i>but I don't think they work.</i>

<i>But they worked last year.</i>

No, I'm telling you
they don't work

because I remember
you were putting them away

and you said they were broken.

<i>Why would I save broken lights?</i>

Do you have lights?
Yep, white or colored?

<i>We don't need lights.</i>

All right, all right.

Here, keep that.
Oh, great, thanks.

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>Just put some hot water</i>
<i>on it tonight.</i>

It breaks open the sap
and absorbs better,

and then just
lukewarm after that.

Lukewarm?
Yeah, middle of the faucet.

Okay.

All right. Well, thanks.

<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>We'll see you again.</i>

<i>Just watch out.</i>
<i>I don't know where you are.</i>

Thank you.
All right, thanks.

<i>No number ones?</i>

Do you not know the difference?

<i>No, I know the difference.</i>

Oh yeah, well, I just don't
like to sell crappy trees.

All right,
it's your money, man.

My brother
went along with that?

<i>Yeah, he didn't care.</i>
<i>He barely sold anything.</i>

<i>He just worked the night shift.</i>

<i>That makes sense.</i>

<i>He says hi by the way.</i>

He still in Massena?
Yeah, working for our dad.

This is where it usually goes?

<i>Yep, that works.</i>

That sign is new.

Finally repaved the road.

I never thought I'd see that.

<i>What else is different?</i>

<i>I go back and the tank's</i>
<i>still just sitting there.</i>

<i>I just don't understand</i>

how the people
doesn't care about the jobs.

They gotta know
how shitty they are.

Yeah, I guess some people
just don't care.

How can you not care,
at least a bit?

<i>You know, not everybody's</i>
<i>like you and me, Martin.</i>

<i>Yeah, that's for sure.</i>

<i>But you must put up</i>
<i>with a lot of shit around here.</i>

Five years running.

Five years?

Holy shit.

I never done
nothing for 5 years.

<i>I was with a woman</i>
<i>for 3 years once.</i>

<i>Where's Mary-Ann?</i>

<i>I didn't see her around.</i>

Yep, she's not
around this year.

<i>I am sorry to hear that.</i>

That must make
your holiday even tougher.

Yeah, it's just 1 month a year.

<i>Christmas.</i>

Christmas sucks.

Seven, eight, no frasers?

Lots of smalls.

You got small frasers.

<i>Not under 4'.</i>

The new Dougs coming in?

<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

Truck's stuck in the snow.

<i>The twins sold some tall ones.</i>

How tall?
A couple 12s, a couple 10s.

You know, those brownstones
over there, high ceilings.

How's your generator doing?
Good.

Why, what happened
to the old one?

<i>Oh, it's noisy.</i>
<i>Some neighbor complained.</i>

Hey, keep what's-his-name's
mitts off that thing, will ya?

Nick, yeah, he'll be all right.

What's that girlfriend's name?
Robin.

<i>Robin, she's</i>
<i>a sweet little thing.</i>

<i>There's oil under the sink.</i>
<i>Every 2 days.</i>

<i>Hey man, Nick, you gotta do</i>
<i>a better job with these needles.</i>

<i>The last few nights the place</i>
<i>has been covered.</i>

But there's barely
any needles anywhere.

Okay, well there
shouldn't be any.

If people see the needles

they'll think
the trees are dead.

<i>The trees are dead,</i>
<i>everyone knows that.</i>

But they don't wanna be
reminded of it, okay?

So when there's needles, which
there will be, you clean 'em up.

That's why I do on my shift,

that's what you do
on your shift.

Okay, that's how it works.
Yeah, I know how it works.

All right, all right.

Hey.

You know, you don't have to be
so hard on him.

He's done this before.
Not here.

<i>Yeah, well I'm sure</i>
<i>even you were new once.</i>

He's got a problem,
he can say so.

<i>We'll be moving</i>
<i>into my sister's place tomorrow.</i>

<i>No more trailer.</i>

<i>Really we could trim him</i>
<i>and make him skinny, right?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I think we got everything,</i>

but if not
we'll just grab it tomorrow.

All right.
See you in the morning.

<i>See you guys.</i>

Sir, is that yours?

Hello? Ma'am?

Hello?

<i>Do you know her?</i>

<i>Ma'am?</i>

<i>Ma'am?</i>

<i>Is this your phone, sir?</i>

Ma'am?

<i>Is this your phone?</i>

<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

Fuck.

All right, a couple more steps.

Step up. Big step up.

Yep. Five years.

<i>You still with Mary-Ann?</i>
<i>She not here this year?</i>

No, she's... yeah,
just me this year.

<i>I don't know, the real kind?</i>

<i>They all look the same to me.</i>

Under the shelf, no way.

It's not gonna fit.

It's not a height issue,
it's the width.

I know because
I'm staring at it.

I don't know,
they're all the same.

All right, fine, I'll ask.

<i>Are they all this wide?</i>

<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

Huh?

<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

This is a little skinnier.

That's not so bad actually.

Yeah, all right, fine.

All right,
hold it straight please.

<i>All right, yeah, I'll send it.</i>

<i>Just gonna be a minute.</i>

<i>Yeah, you get it yet?</i>

<i>Sure, I love your tortellini.</i>

<i>What about that tuna thing?</i>

<i>All right.</i>

<i>I don't know, 4 feet.</i>
<i>How tall is that?</i>

Yeah, 4 feet.

<i>It's gonna come up</i>
<i>to your chest.</i>

<i>All right, fine.</i>
<i>I'll stand next to the next one.</i>

<i>What do you call it?</i>

It's a balsam fir.
Balsam fir.

It's like the wood,
it's super light.

How light is this?
It's pretty light.

No, it's not that light.
Why is it so heavy?

<i>I mean, it's a Christmas tree.</i>

<i>It's not... you might be thinking</i>
<i>of balsa wood.</i>

<i>Oh, balsa wood.</i>

And this is?
This is a balsam fir.

<i>Balsam fir.</i>
<i>Okay, I guess she don't like it.</i>

What else you got?

Well, we got Douglas firs,
something like this.

<i>All right, hold it up though.</i>

<i>You gotta hold it</i>
<i>straight, man.</i>

<i>All right, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it.</i>

<i>Okay, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it to you.</i>

<i>Oh shit, I forgot</i>
<i>to stand next to it.</i>

All right, if you guys are
gonna get coffee every morning,

you gotta get back by 9.

I've been working a 12-hour
shift, I just wanna go to bed.

All right, we work
12 hours too, man.

<i>Yeah, and I'm never late</i>
<i>to relieve you.</i>

It's only 5 minutes,
all right, relax.

You know what?
Is it too much to ask?

I've been sitting out
in the rain all night,

I just wanna go to bed.
Jesus Christ.

All right.
You want some muffin?

No.

<i>Do you work here?</i>

<i>I can help you.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>These are all</i>
<i>the most beautiful.</i>

Hi.
Hey.

<i>Do you remember me?</i>

<i>No, I meet a lot of people.</i>

<i>Do you work nights here?</i>

<i>Just 'til 9.</i>

<i>And who works after 9?</i>

The night guy.
Is he here?

<i>He's inside.</i>
<i>Can I help you with something?</i>

<i>No, I just...</i>
<i>I've met him before.</i>

<i>I just need to ask him</i>
<i>a question.</i>

<i>Noel, you got a visitor.</i>

Hi.

Hi.

Do you remember me?

Yeah.

Can I come in?

Okay.

Um, I don't really remember
what happened

or how I got here.

Um, I found you in the park
passed out on a bench.

You found me in the park
passed out on a bench?

Yeah, and you were sitting
next to a homeless man

who had your cell phone,
and you only had one shoe on,

and you had gum in your hair.

<i>And it was freezing,</i>
<i>so I carried you back here</i>

<i>and laid you in bed, and cut</i>
<i>the gum out of your hair.</i>

<i>Yeah, sorry,</i>
<i>I didn't know how to get it out.</i>

<i>Um, and my other shoe?</i>

I didn't see it.
I didn't see a second shoe.

This is pretty embarrassing.

And my wallet?
I lost my wallet.

You didn't see it anywhere?

No.

<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>how I got there?</i>

No.

<i>All right, well, thanks anyway.</i>

Can I get a holiday riches?

Okay. What else?

And a 6-hour energy.

Six hour.
That's it.

<i>That's it?</i>

Thank you, have a good day.
Thanks.

Anything I need to know?

This Fraser sold.

The woman's coming back
tomorrow morning.

All right.

Oh, and baler netting,
we couldn't find any.

Should be in the closet.

<i>Actually, neither of us</i>
<i>have ever changed it,</i>

so would you mind
showing us how?

Yeah, I don't like
to waste any,

so I'll just change it
when it runs out later.

I mean, it's easy.
You just gotta figure it out.

All right, see you later.

<i>Oh, oh, oh, what's the deal</i>
<i>with deliveries?</i>

<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>Well, the sign</i>
<i>says we gladly deliver.</i>

<i>Up to you.</i>

If we deliver
or if we do it gladly?

Either.

<i>Well, I told this woman</i>
<i>that we do it.</i>

Yeah, the day guy
usually takes care of it

at the end of his shift.

Where is it?
The other side of town.

Take the truck.
Okay.

<i>There is always</i>
<i>the hunter and the hunted,</i>

<i>the pursuer and the pursued.</i>

<i>It may be the voice</i>
<i>of authority</i>

<i>or a race with death</i>
<i>and destruction,</i>

<i>the most relentless</i>
<i>of the hunters.</i>

<i>There are times when laughter</i>
<i>is heard as counterpoint,</i>

<i>and moments when sheer terror</i>
<i>is the theme!</i>

<i>But always, there is the chase.</i>

<i>Come in, my dear.</i>

<i>It was almost unbelievable.</i>

<i>When he recovered</i>
<i>consciousness,</i>

<i>he lay on the floor, staring,</i>

<i>until I summoned</i>
<i>the authorities.</i>

<i>And you sell stands too?</i>

Yeah, you need one?

<i>How does it work?</i>

Three screws through the holes.

And then I fill it with water?

<i>Water. Do I put water in it?</i>

Yeah, water.
Fill it with water.

<i>How often do I refill it?</i>

Whenever it gets empty.

<i>So basically he asked me out</i>
<i>to laser tag,</i>

<i>but I obviously...</i>

hi, do you have the Obama tree?

What?

The Christmas tree
that the Obama's have.

It's the Colorado blue spruce.
It's from Ohio.

Yeah, we have
some blue spruces.

Oh, is it from Ohio?

Yeah, the seeds are.
Oh, cool.

It's from here, grown here.

Oh, a local tree.

I don't have to tell you the
Curbers come out of your share.

Yeah, it'll pick up.
No one else is so far behind.

<i>Talk to Nick, he's the day guy.</i>

<i>Day guy?</i>

<i>You talked me</i>
<i>into giving you the night shift.</i>

You vouched
for Nick what's-his-name

and his girlfriend.

Sell trees.

Hi.

Listen, I felt a little bad
for the way I acted before.

I should have been
more appreciative

for what you did for me.

<i>It's pumpkin.</i>

What is this?

These?

These are blackberries.

My mom does it.

Your mom made that?
No, I made it.

So, did you figure out
what happened?

<i>Psh, no.</i>

<i>I just drank too much.</i>

I think I drank goldschlãger.

So, this is where you live?
Yeah.

<i>You're not from here?</i>

No, I live upstate.

You must love this.

Love this?
Yeah, the excitement.

I mean, living in a camper
on the streets of New York,

spreading Christmas spirit.

<i>Yeah, I guess</i>
<i>it's a good contrast.</i>

<i>From what?</i>

My regular life, I guess.

So, what do you do
with the leftover trees?

There aren't any.

Never?
No.

What if there are?

There's not.
Why not?

'Cause we got it down
to a science.

<i>But let's say</i>
<i>divine intervention.</i>

<i>Little baby Jesus comes down</i>
<i>because it's Christmas</i>

and he and the wise men
stand on that corner

and they tell everyone who
comes along not to buy a tree

because they won't
get into heaven,

and people listen, obviously,

'cause it's Jesus
and it's Christmas.

Yeah, well, I guess
in that scenario

we would just leave 'em
on the curb?

For people to take?
Sure.

But you have no experience
with this, obviously.

They all end up
on the curb eventually.

This your crew?

Old crew.

<i>Aww, look at you.</i>

<i>That your girlfriend?</i>

<i>Used to be.</i>

Listen, it's Noel, right?

Yeah.

N-o-e-l?

Yeah.
Who sells Christmas trees.

Mm-hmm.

Thank you for helping me out
the other night.

Are these all the wreaths
that you have?

There's a couple more up front.

Are there any without all
this stuff on it, just plain?

Nope, just these.

Can you take
all this stuff off?

<i>Like, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

What... you just don't want...

<i>yeah, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

What do you mean?
Like, without this.

You just want a plain wreath?
Yeah.

Is that...
Yeah.

Do it for $15.
All right.

So?
Thanks.

Yeah, just throw
some hot water on it tonight,

breaks open the sap.

And then just regular tap water
after that, room temperature.

Good to go, thanks.

Hey, what kind of tree is this?

That's a Douglas fir.

What about this one?
These are Fraser firs.

What's the difference?

Fraser firs are most popular,
easiest to take care of,

live the longest.

They all have pretty much
the same shape.

Douglas fir, more unique,
you got needles

going all around the branches
to make it look fluffy.

Which do the ladies like?

Probably the Douglas fir.

It has the most smell,
but it requires the most care.

What, like rub their feet?

No, you just gotta...

you can't put it
near sunlight or direct heat.

You got a spray bottle, it's
a good idea to keep it misted.

All right.

Women like 'em?

Yeah.
Cool.

Let me... let me see this one.

<i>Nice.</i>

<i>Spin it.</i>

<i>Cool, yeah, I'll take it.</i>

Seventy-two.

Hey, do you sell lights?
Yep, white or colored?

<i>White.</i>

<i>Hey, make it two.</i>

<i>You got a couple packs at home?</i>

<i>No, why?</i>

You're gonna need
about four for that tree.

<i>Four, really?</i>
<i>Hey, can you test them.</i>

I got one home last year,
it didn't work.

All right, yeah, come on in.

Nice crib you got here, man.

These are good.

<i>These are good.</i>

What are those, blackberries?

All good.

Are those blackberries?
Huh?

<i>Did you make that pie?</i>

No, some girl made it for me.

Your girlfriend?

No.

Some girl stays here one night,
now she's baking pies for me.

<i>Do you need a bag for this?</i>

No.

You want an ornament, free?

No.

You sure?

Yeah, fine, give me one.

You want to pick one out?

The big one.

<i>I don't need change.</i>

<i>It's just one 4-foot Doug,</i>
<i>there's no stand.</i>

<i>Baby, you're dying.</i>

Let me just ask Noel
if he wants to do it.

No, it's just one tree.
I can do it.

<i>All right,</i>
<i>how 'bout I do it then.</i>

<i>Come on, it's pretty small and</i>
<i>it's a first floor apartment.</i>

I can do it, come on.

No, I feel like shit
but I'd rather do it myself

than have you freeze.

It's fine,
I can handle one tree.

I'll do it.

Coming.
I got it.

<i>Oh honey, that thing is huge.</i>

Come on in.

Where do you want it?
Straight back.

Can I get one of you guys
to hold this up

while I screw this in?

Yeah, I got it.

Still look straight?

<i>Yeah.</i>

Okay, you can let go.

So, we're all set here.

Cool, man,
thanks so much, here you go.

Great.
Thanks.

Happy holidays.

You too.

Can I see this one?

<i>No, no, no, that one.</i>

<i>Oh yeah, just tonight,</i>
<i>just throw some hot water on it.</i>

Helps absorb the... helps
the... break open the sap.

Helps absorb better.

And then after that,
just normal...

hey!

<i>You all right?</i>

<i>You okay?</i>

<i>Noel?</i>

Noel? What the fuck, dude?
Wake up.

I just fell asleep.

Are you okay?
Yeah.

Those are trees?
Behind you, trees?

Yeah, trees.

Yeah, you know,
they look perfect.

Just perfect.

But you see, this
is a Polish neighborhood,

and in Poland,
trees have character.

<i>They are not perfect,</i>
<i>but they have a character.</i>

Like tonight, you go to a forest
and every tree is dressed.

Dressed in a wedding white...
like, brides all of them.

<i>But you must have an axe,</i>
<i>not a chainsaw.</i>

<i>Chainsaw makes noise.</i>

<i>Everybody gets scared.</i>

<i>Trees get scared.</i>

Cheers!

Cheers.
Do you work here?

Oh, yeah.

Do you have any decorated ones?

Yeah, there's
a couple of 'em over here.

<i>Are you gonna get more?</i>

I just make 'em myself,
so when we run out,

I'll make a couple more.

Kinda sad, I know.
No, this is lovely.

<i>It's perfect.</i>

<i>Mistletoe?</i>

<i>Holly.</i>

<i>Juniper and noble fir.</i>

Pine?
Yep, white pine.

And what's this?
Western red cedar.

<i>I love it.</i>

<i>I love it.</i>

What about the trees?

<i>We have an artificial tree</i>
<i>where I work.</i>

Everybody loves it,
but I just... i don't know.

I feel like it'd be so much
better if it was a real one.

Yeah, nothing beats
the real thing.

<i>It's not too late, is it?</i>

<i>No, not at all.</i>

<i>A lot of people wait</i>
<i>'til Christmas Eve,</i>

spend all night decorating it.

Wow.

Do you deliver?
Yeah.

Can you deliver to bushwick?

Sure.

Earliest I can do would be
tomorrow night, though.

That's all right.

Can you deliver it
Christmas Eve,

and then we can decorate it
like you said?

Yeah, I got a couple more
deliveries Christmas Eve.

Great.

So you want this one?

<i>Yeah, and the wreath.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

Do I pay for it now?

You can pay for it
when I deliver it.

<i>Oh, great.</i>

<i>Here's the address</i>
<i>and the number is there too.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

All right.
Fantastic.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Morning.

Hey man, how you doing?
Hey, how's it going out there?

Great, I sold 25 today
and a bunch of wreaths too.

I think we might be out
by tomorrow.

Awesome man, great job.

We're getting
the last load in tonight.

Think you got
one more day in you?

Should be okay.

Tell you what, let me take
care of those deliveries for you

tomorrow night.

Really?
Yeah.

That'd be great.

I'm gonna finish up.

Not bad.
Few more coming in?

Nope.

What?
Too risky.

We're closing down early.

Give me 20 more.
I'll have 'em all sold.

Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, you
know how busy the last day is.

Curbers come out of your ass.

There won't be any.

You'll have 15 more tomorrow.

There you go.
Oh, great.

Thank you so much.
All right, happy holidays!

So, you lookin' for something
a little slimmer or is that...

<i>are you looking for anything</i>
<i>a little slimmer or is this...</i>

<i>merry Christmas.</i>

<i>I need the pan back.</i>

Excuse me?
The pie pan, I need it back.

<i>I haven't cleaned it yet.</i>

<i>Please just</i>
<i>give me back the pan.</i>

<i>Are you serious? Yeah, okay.</i>

Is everything all right?

This look like a 4'?
Huh?

Yeah, it's a 4'.

Tall 4', but
definitely not a 5'.

Okay.

Don't forget about the one
from last night.

Yeah, it's in the truck already.
You're all good to go.

All right, thanks.

Did you tell my boyfriend
we hooked up?

What?

Why would you do that?

He said he came and bought
a tree from you,

and asked about the pie,
and you said we hooked up.

That guy was your boyfriend?

Yes, why would you say that?

I didn't say anything.

Well, then
why would he think that?

I don't know.
I don't even know him.

Uh...

I think he punched me
in the face yesterday.

What?

Somebody came up and clocked
me from behind and ran away.

Sound like something he'd do?

I think you should go home.

I'm locked out.

Sorry, I just need a minute.

Can I just hang here
for a second?

I gotta go make some
deliveries.

You wanna come?

<i>Come on in, thanks for coming!</i>

Sure.

I drilled a hole,
it should be wide enough.

<i>Thank you!</i>

<i>Hi, guys.</i>

You want this around here?

<i>Oh, it's perfect, thank you.</i>

<i>We got our tree</i>
<i>from you last year.</i>

<i>Oh, great.</i>

<i>How old is the tree?</i>

This tree is about 5 years old.

How old are you guys?

I'm 8.
I'm 5.

<i>Do you work for Santa?</i>

Well, we're more
like colleagues.

What is a colleague?

People who work together.

<i>Does that look good, straight?</i>

Great, thank you so much.
Thank you.

All right guys.
Merry Christmas, thank you.

Enjoy.
Bye.

Maybe there's an elevator?

There's never an elevator.
Is it open?

Uh, yes.

<i>Do you know</i>
<i>whose house this is?</i>

Nice tree.

Do you know
whose house this is?

No.
Do you know a Matt?

Oh, I think he's back there.

<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

<i>Hey, there's the tree.</i>

Is this your place?
It is indeed.

Where do you want this?

<i>Right there is fine.</i>

I'm sorry about before,
the whole pie thing.

That's all right.
He'll get over it.

How's your face?

It's all right.

I've been punched before.

You know, I guess
I just got excited

<i>somebody made a pie for me.</i>

Hey.
Hey, how are you?

Good.
Thank you for coming.

<i>Sure, sure, sure.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Oh, I'll show you... this way.</i>

How's it look?

Ooh!

It's a hit.

All right.

They just, they love it,
I can tell you.

Yeah, great.

<i>Before you go,</i>
<i>can I give you something?</i>

<i>Sure.</i>

<i>This is a tea flower.</i>

You put it in your cup
of boiling water and it blooms.

<i>It's very nice.</i>

Fair enough.
I'll walk you guys out.

Great, thank you so much.
Thank you, take care.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Should I drop you home?

He's still not answering.

Can we deliver more trees?

You can come wait at the stand.

Okay.

You need us to stay?
No, you guys are good.

Just see you in the morning
for the breakdown.

Just one more left.

Still could sell it.

All right guys.
See you in a bit.

So, what's next?

What do you mean?

<i>You can't sell Christmas</i>
<i>trees all year.</i>

<i>I build houses</i>
<i>the rest of the year.</i>

<i>It's pretty dead through march.</i>

We used to spend
January traveling.

You know what,
you wanna play some cards?

<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

<i>What do you wanna play?</i>

<i>Well, I usually play solitaire.</i>

<i>Do you want me to watch?</i>

Gin rummy?
Okay.

<i>Do you know how to play?</i>

Yes I do.

I lost count, was that ten?

<i>I wasn't counting.</i>

Hey sorry,
I don't really wanna play.

<i>That's fine.</i>

You got that tea flower?
Mm-hmm.

<i>Do you have a kettle?</i>

Sure do.

<i>Kettle.</i>

<i>How about something</i>
<i>to put it in?</i>

Something clear, possibly.

Yeah, there's a jar over there.

Wanna take the label off?
Yes.

What's going on?
The generator ran out of gas.

<i>What time is it?</i>

<i>It's around 3.</i>

<i>I should go.</i>

<i>The tea flower.</i>

<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

<i>Just a second.</i>
