Yeah?

Hey, it's Johnny.
Listen, Jesse wanted me

to finish this deal,
so that's why I'm calling.

Okay, all right.
You got the address?

Yeah, I got it.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

All right, I'll be there in 20.

A Subtitle by R3V0LV3R.

For the Georgetown
bank robbers.

This one's for you.

Come on.

Enjoy your workout, man.

Thanks, man.

Uh, wait a second.

Your card...
it's not going through.

Do you mind scanning it again for me?
Yeah.

Did it work?

Let's try something different.
Uh, what's your phone number?

Just use my work code... 00493.

You work here?
Weekends, usually.

Um, all right. You're all set.

I guess I'll see you around.
Bye.

"Stephanie."

Wow! It must be
a pretty special girl.

Oh, she's just a girl
from the gym.

No big deal. Actually, I did need
your opinion on something.

All right.

This one here
or this one right here?

I like that one.
Okay.

That's all right.

Mom's choice anyways, right?

It looks good.

Let's see what this is about.
It's kinda nerve-racking.

Hey! How are you?
Hi! I'm okay.

Oh, good to see you.
Okay, cool.

Pretty cool, huh?
It... it's crazy stuff.

I'm liking it though.

Some of these guys
are really good,

but just wait till
you see my brother.

Your brother's the leader of the pack?
He's the best one.

Oh, here he is.

Whoo! Yeah!

He's the best one. Definitely best.
That guy's a nutcase.

That was awesome. Come here.

Thanks, sis.

Hey, Jesse, this is Johnny.
What's up, man?

Dude, Jesse Meyers, man.
We went to school together in Burbank.

You were a senior
when I was a freshman.

Fuck that place.

Dude, you were
in my metal class.

You always used to come
all banged up. I understand why.

It's insane what you do, man.

Yeah, I do kinda
remember you now.

Yeah, Jesse doesn't hang out
in Burbank much anymore

since he always
gets in trouble.

Gotta love this girl.

Always looking out
for her big brother.

Aww.
Look, man, I gotta get back out there.

Catch up with you afterwards.
It was great seeing you, man.

Whoo!
Don't get her pregnant.

Mom will be pissed.

Thanks. Thanks, bro.
Sweet bike.

Dude, drive one of these things,
for sure you're getting pussy, dude.

Bye.

See you later, bro.

And that's my brother.

Hey, Steph. It's been awhile.
Hey, David.

How have you been?
How are you?

Everything's good.
Who's the lucky guy?

This is my friend Johnny.
I'm Johnny.

He just wanted to come out here
and see what this was all about.

What do you think
about all this, Johnny?

This stuff's pretty
freaking awesome.

Beats a day job, huh?

God, yeah.

Hey, your brother's doing
really good since he came back.

Thank God.
Yup.

You look good.
It's good to see you.

I'm gonna get back to it.
Take care, Johnny.

Good seeing you again.
It's nice meeting you.

Everyone's really nice. This is great.
Yeah.

Thanks.

It's like a couple of lunatics.

It's good, man.

What up, man? It's good.

What up, bro?
It's good.

How you doing?

A round of JÃ¤ger shots, man.

Dude, you don't
fuck around here.

The second you get here,
you're already ready to go.

Me and your sister haven't
even had a drink.

Well, I gotta get buckled
if we're gonna hump at midnight.

Are you ready for this shit?

Yeah, dude.
Here you go, princess.

Thank you.
To a wonderful evening, right?

To the best year ever.

Good riding today, Meyers.

Oh, dude. What's up, man?

Gonna be ready for FMX Games
this summer?

Why do you even
ask me that, dude?

You know I grease it every time.
I'm the boss, man.

I have to ask you.
All right, dude.

You know me, dude.
I'm gonna be there.

That's what I'm talking about.

So do me a favor, man.
Take it easy tonight, all right?

We've got a big week ahead of us and our
new bikes are coming in on Thursday.

Yeah, no problem, man.
All right.

Gotta tell you, man,
Rudy's talking shit, man.

Huh.
Telling me he's got some secret trick

that he ain't gonna show you.
I ain't worried about it.

I'll be there.

All right, man.
Have a good time tonight.

All right.
Hey, Steph, do me a favor

and babysit this guy for me.

I'll try.
All right.

See ya, guys.
See ya.

Fucking guy's such a buzzkill.

He's just trying
to encourage you, Jesse.

Yeah, well, I'm fucking over it.

Hey, another round, please.

Yeah, make mine's
a double, please.

Look at him, dude. Starting to feel
real good about yourself, aren't you?

Well, it's gotta be
my favorite shirt.

You know how it is.
Yeah, don't mess with the shirt, dude.

But... cheers.

Whoo!

Yeah, man.

Yeah!

Listen, I think it's
my turn for another drink,

so I'm gonna be at the bar, okay?
Okay.

I'll be right back.
Yeah. Yeah, go.

Another sh... let's do another shot.
Yeah, a shot.

Hey.

Hey.

So, umm...

Almost happy New Year.

It is. It's almost New Year's.

And...?
And, uh, to a good year?

And five...
Four,

three, two, one!

Happy New Year!

Sorry, I'm suddenly...

See? You look good.

So do you.

Huh-uh.

God! Stop!

I told you I'm not ready yet.

God.

The fuck's your problem?
Nothing.

God. Leave me alone.

The fuck you do
to my little sister?

Nothing, man. I swear.

I didn't do anything.
What's your issue?

Then why the fuck's she laying
on the couch in the other room?

I did nothing to your sister, man.
Quit it, all right?

She just doesn't let me, man.

What a bitch, dude.

Hey, sis, why don't
you stop being such a prude

and let this kid hit it?
Jesse, you're an asshole.

So are you, dick.

So anyways, man,
where'd you get that shirt?

Your sister.
Oh yeah?

It's way better than
those lame-ass polo shirts

I always see you
trying to sport.

Yeah.

So anyways, you wanna
get out of here?

And go where?
To the IE, dude.

Sack up. Let's go.

The IE?

Hey, man, so when's the last time
you hit some puss, dude?

I don't know, man.
It's been awhile.

Does porn count?
Come on, guy. Are you serious?

You know why, right?
Why?

'Cause you do that whole
"relationship" thing.

You're, like, trying
to find the right chick,

take 'em out to dinner
and just "wifey" 'em, dude.

The bitches I hang out with,
straight up,

they come over,
they dumb you up

and they peace out, dude.
You don't gotta spend a cent on 'em.

That's... that's pretty cool, dude.
Pretty cool.

So speaking of that, I got two of them
on deck for this evening.

Are you... are you ready
to hang or what?

Oh, man, that... that sounds...
you know what?

It sounds super tempting,
but I don't know, man.

If your sister finds out,
I'm in deep shit.

Come on, guy. Are you
fucking serious, dude?

You really think I'd rat you out
like a little bitch?

You know who you're
hanging out with right now?

But don't get me wrong, man.
The second you do get some from her...

Oh, no no no, you don't
have to worry about that.

I mean,
your sister's so fucking...

So fucking what, dude?
Shut the fuck up.

She's my little sister.

My bad, man.
I got carried away.

All right, man.
Well, what about you simmer down

and fucking take a rip of this?

Are you serious?

What's the big deal?
Are you scared or something.

No, man, it's just that...

all right, fuck it, dude.

Hold up real quick.
Gotta handle something.

What you got there?
Got it.

All right.

The fuck were you doing, dude?

You know that chick?
No, just some bitch, man.

What was that?

That's what it was... business.
You're kidding, right, dude?

You deal?
Yeah, why?

What's it to you?
I don't know, man.

I just thought maybe you'd make enough
money off the motocross, that's all.

Yeah, I do, man.
I can't do that shit forever.

I like this shit.
This is where it's at, dude.

Don't gotta risk
getting all hurt,

fucked up, getting buckled.

Fuck all that noise, dude.

Besides, I do it
for this right here.

That's why I do it.

Wow.

Sick of all this whining
and shit, man.

It's party time.

Here, man. Have a go.
Oh no, dude.

That's cool, man. The weed's...
the weed's, like, whatever, dude.

But that... definitely...
no, you're out of your mind, dude.

I'm not messing
with that cocaine stuff.

Pfft. Whatever, man.

Dude, I can't even believe I'm in
this car with that shit in it right now.

You gonna be a bitch, dude,

or are you gonna sack up
and roll with the boys?

You know what?
Call those hos, dude.

See what's going on tonight.
I'm kinda down, actually.

Dude, I'm already on it.

You already knew I was
gonna change my mind.

That's funny.
Hold on, give me a second.

Oh fuck, dude.
It's your fucking sister.

What a buzzkill, dude.
Yeah.

It's like she's a psychic
or something, man.

Why she be calling right now?
What do I tell her?

Fucking voice-mail
that shit, dude.

We're rolling out, man.

Oh fuck, dude. I'm in so much
deep shit because of you.

Shut the fuck up.

Jesse's in the house!

250-foot jumps,

no shirt, smoking cigs, dude.

I like going big. That's how
I do this shit, you know?

Dude, I got my boys coming. Hold on.
What up, Jesse?

Here they are.
Yeah. What up, Jesse?

Where you been, homey?
Just cruising.

Right on.
Rudy, this is my boy Johnny.

This is Rudy.
What up, John? How you doing, bro?

You having fun?
This looks like a fun place.

Nice. Dude, hold...
hold on, dude. Hold on.

What do you got? What is it?
It's those fucking posers.

Those guys think
they fucking run this shit, dude.

You take care of them.
Hey, you motherfuckers.

The fuck you think
you're doing here, bro?

You heard me, man.
Get the fuck out of my house, bro.

Thought you could just
come and suck dudes off?

What the fuck's your deal, bro?

What did you say?

Yo, dude, fuck you.

Oh shit yeah.

Rough him up, Rudy.
You've got balls.

You got it, man!
Yeah yeah!

Oh yeah, dude.
Shit, he fucked 'em up.

Fucked 'em up big time.

Those fucking
dumb-ass posers, dude.

Fuck. They ain't
coming back here, bro.

I don't understand, man.
What did these guys do?

Dude, they're fucking nut riders.

They come in here,
acting like they ride dirt bikes...

they're lifted F1s...
thinking they're all sick.

All they do is
just ride our nuts

and we're
fucking sick of it, man.

I'll take a little bump.
Why not?

Yeah! Now I'm pumped up.

Dude, what sweet-ass hos
you guys wanna fuck tonight, man?

I got 'em all.
I'm fucking over it, man.

My dick's still sore
from last night.

If I fucked a chick
that was 200 lbs, man,

my dick'd be hurting
for a month, bro, but hey.

Hey, fuck you, man.
You want some?

Yeah.

My boy here, he's been on a dry spell,
if you know what I mean.

So you need to get him set up
with something, all right?

Bro, I got you set up. Hey, Amber.
Do you want any?

I don't really...

Dude, fucking hit it, you puss.

You're hanging out with us, man.

Yeah.
Whatever. Hey.

Take this,
take him to my room...

actually, not my room...
the next room to the right.

Hey.
Show this guy a good time, all right?

Yeah yeah, I'm fine.
You can't have a bad time with that.

Let's go party, bro.

Fucking great.
You're kinda cute.

Really?
Yeah.

You wanna go?
Yeah.

Let's go.

Come on.

All right, watch me, okay?

All right, so go ahead
and put this on my back and sniff it.

Okay.
Ready?

It wasn't that bad, right?

No, not really. No, it was fine.
No. No.

Guess you'll never forget
the first time you did that, huh?

No.

You know weed's a natural
aphrodisiac, right?

Is it? I should probably smoke.
Mmm.

Breathe.

I think I'm ready.

Really?

Yeah, it's just that...
I mean, I know

it's been really bothering you

and I've made you wait so long.

I have an idea.

It actually might
help us out. Hold on.

What is it?

Just hold off a minute.

It's weed.

I heard it's like
an aphrodisiac.

Where did you get that?

Your brother gave it to me.

Babe, I smoke.

I do it every once
in a while just to relax.

Here, have some.

I don't want any.

Babe, don't act like
you've never done it.

I know! I just
don't want any, okay?

F...

fine. You know what?

All right, let's just fuck then.

What?

I... you know what? I...

I just... I gotta go.

The fuck, man?

Wait. Remind me why
I need a new car again?

I mean, my Nissan works
perfectly fine, man.

Man, you can't be
hanging out with me

in that piece
of shit Nissan, dude.

You're rocking with the best.
Don't you know?

We gotta have image, style, you know?
Come on.

So anyways, I heard about
what happened with my sister, dude.

What were you... what the fuck
were you thinking, man?

Damn, she told you?
Yeah.

Damn, I know, man.
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

Yeah, man, there's
way smoother ways

of fucking getting
yourself up in there, dude.

Expect you're gonna have
to try pretty hard,

especially since
she's a virgin and all.

Wait. She's a virgin, dude?

Yeah, she may not
look like she's a virgin,

but trust me, she is.

Um, damn. I really messed up.

That was coming in
way too hot, dude.

Hey, Jesse.
What's up, little pimp?

It's good, man.
It's been awhile.

Yeah, it has.
What you doing here?

Oh, just came over here.
This is my boy Johnny.

He's looking for a new whip.
Nice to meet you.

Johnny, Hector.
Pleasure meeting you.

So what are you looking for?
What are you in the market for?

Transportation?
You trying to get laid?

What are you trying to do here?

According to
my friend right here...

He needs to upgrade his image, man.
He's dorking out.

Guess I'm trying to get laid.
Yeah? Okay.

Well, right here is just
a little basic transportation

for the nine-to-fivers.
Yeah.

Let him know about
that stash you have.

Ahh, I got some
pimp shit over here.

I was holding it for my nephew,

but he's been
fucking up in college.

This your boy, huh?
Yeah, he's my guy.

Dude, I'm co-signing it.
This might be out of your league,

but if he's co-signing for you,
we'll work something out.

Come on, step over here.

Here you go.
This is next level shit.

Pimp pimp pimp and more pimp.

Actually, two steps
ahead of a pimp.

What did I tell you
about this guy?

Dude, this is...

No more dorking out
in the Nissan, dude.

If you wanna pull bitches,
you gotta upgrade.

This is what I'm talking about.
Watch your pussy ratio

go way up. You're gonna need to be
twins up in this motherfucker

much pussy as you're
gonna be getting.

You got him, right?
This is a sweet car.

Yeah, he's my guy.
I'm co-signing.

All right, let's handle this.

I got some other business
I gotta take care of.

Yeah, buddy.
You'll be rolling out in a minute.

Welcome to the big leagues.

Hey.

Look, I just want to apologize
about the other day, okay?

I mean, I don't know what...

I don't know what was
running through my head.

Babe, what is this?

I couldn't be picking up
my baby girl in a piece of shit Nissan.

Babe, where did you get a new car?
Don't worry about that, okay?

Look, let's just go for a ride.
You're gonna love this thing.

Yeah, okay.
Let's go.

Fuck yeah, dude.
This thing's sick.

What I tell you?
You like it?

Of course, man.
I helped you pick it out.

I thought it was
gonna be just us.

Baby, stop making it
such a big deal.

It's not.
Come on, dude,

fucking pin it.
Let's get out of here.

Johnny?

What are you doing, getting home
at 6:00 in the morning?

Shit. It is?
Yeah.

Hey, this is getting ridiculous.

Well, that you either
don't come home

or you come home at all hours
of the night like this.

I'm jus... I'm just.

I'm very sorry.
Come here.

Gimme those glasses.

Look...
What are you doing?

Are you doing anything illegal?

Illegal?

No, Mother, not illegal.

"Mother." Okay.
I'm... look,

I'm... I'm helping
my friend out with some...

he's just a motocross guy.

And he does these crazy jumps

and a lot of people come out
and cheer for him, whatever.

Anyways, besides that,

he... he... he...
he has these, um,

these events
that he's gotta do.

Mm-hmm.
You know, motocross stuff...

sponsorships and appearances.
And I just...

look, I just gotta be there to help him
and support the guy, okay?

Do you understand me?
All right.

You get me? All right?

Mm-hmm.
That's it.

Jonathan, here.

I will clean that up, okay?
Just...

I'm just glad you're home safe.

And you stink,
so just go on to bed.

Wow.

I didn't expect
to see you here.

I'm gonna be honest with you.

I don't know what to tell you.

I don't know what to say, okay?

You haven't called me
in two weeks.

I haven't even heard
from you in three.

You stood me up
for Valentine's Day.

Did you know that?

Look, I was out in the IE.

By the time I noticed,

it was... it was way
past time to get back.

I would've never made it back.

And you couldn't even
call and let me know.

I mean, you thought that
I would be okay with that?

No. No, not really.

I can't do this anymore.
What?

This. I...

ever since you started
hanging out with Jesse,

it's like you're pretending
to be someone that you're not.

No, that's... that's not even true.
Yes!

Dude, I know what happens
when he goes out!

I'm not stupid!

I can't do this.

You need to go.

But I... I thought...
No.

Oh fuck, man.

This was probably a bad idea.

I guess I'll just see you around.

Yeah, I guess. Whatever.

I ain't God. My boys can't make it
look like a goddamn Mercedes.

Man, call me back
when you get something real.

Fucking dick.
Ha. What up, Jesse?

What's good? Just came to do
that pick-up real quick.

What's up, brother? Cool cool.
What up?

Hey, you're the one with the Caprice.
How's she riding?

Pfft! Like a fucking dream.
Nice.

Fellas, can you
excuse us for a second?

We got some private shit
we gotta talk about.

Be two minutes.

So I'm a little concerned.

You've been outta
the game for a minute.

You ready for this?
Yeah, man, you know I got this shit.

What's up with your boys?
You usually handle this shit by yourself.

I like it better that way.
Yeah, I know,

but they're cool, man.
Don't worry about it.

They find out they're facing
five to ten if they get popped

and they turn rat, how cool
are they gonna be then?

Dude, I know these dudes.
They ain't gonna turn rat.

Yeah well, it's worth the money.

Hell yeah, five G's, right?

Yeah.
We get it next week, right?

Upon delivery.
Fool, don't come at me like that.

All right, man.

Yeah?

Hey, boss, Louis is
here to see you.

Good. He better have
some fucking good news too.

Okay.

All right, here's the keys...

and the address.
This one's down in Long Beach.

All right, man, thanks.
Okay, bro.

Be seeing you real soon.
All right.

All right, you fellas,
you have a good trip. Be safe.

I hope you've got
some good news, man.

Man, get the fuck out there.

Here, follow us.

Follow you for what, dude?
I thought I was coming with you guys.

Then how the fuck are
we gonna get back?

I'm leaving this piece
of shit there.

Dude, where are
we going anyways, guy?

Long Beach.
We're gonna go to Long Beach in this

piece of shit car. You know it's gonna
break down in the middle of the night,

then we're fucked.
It ain't breaking down.

We're going there,
we're getting paid,

and Hector told me
the drop-off spot.

It's a house party.
What if we're late for practice, dude?

You know David.
We were late one time before,

what did he do?
Fucking chewed you another ass.

You know what? Fuck David.
He ain't my fucking boss.

Dude, I'm about to get paid.
See you in Long Beach, bro.

All right? Killer, guy. Dork.

Don't worry, man. It's cool.

Motherfucker,
you wanna act like a bitch

and not give me
my motherfucking money?

You think I would let a bitch
like you get over on me?

Oh, come on, man.
What the fuck?

Listen, man.
You wanna act like a fucking bitch?

I'll treat you like a bitch,
like the bitch you are.

Damn it!
Motherfucker, two days.

Two fucking days, I gotta find
my fucking car around the corner?

Okay okay, man! I fucking
brought your shit, didn't I?

You're doing more of my motherfucking
dope than you're delivering.

You're lucky if I even
fuck with you again.

Get the fuck outta here,
you junkie.

Clean your shit up.

I can fucking clean up, man.
Get the fuck out of here.

You Jesse?
Yeah, it's good.

Well, follow me.
All right, dude.

I'll be right back.
You guys just chill.

Yeah.

All right.
Here.

What's your name?
Danielle.

Danielle.

Dude, if you guys ain't gonna
fucking smoke that shit,

will you pass it already?
Calm down, man.

I'm not trying to be rude. I'm trying
to introduce myself to the girl.

Give me a chance.

Where'd Hector get
this dude, man?

Oh, that's beautiful.

Sure is.

Yo, I heard you guys
got something for me.

Yeah, you know what?
Let's finish this

then we'll take care of that business.
All right, man.

Come on, let's just get this
and stack it over there.

Looks like we have
a lot in common.

Yeah, I guess so,

but you didn't even
give me your name, bad boy.

Oh shit, I didn't?
No.

Can you give it
to me right now?

Dude, hey, if you don't
give it to her, man,

I'm gonna take over
this shit. Sorry, buddy.

What about me?
You can join anytime.

Two broads is better
than one, buddy.

Anyways... no no.
Come on.

This guy... this guy...

Well, listen, my name is Johnny.
I'm Johnny.

Johnny.
Yeah.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

Oh, trust me,
the pleasure is all mine.

I hope not.
Fuck, man.

I have my moments.

So what's this moment?

Ah.

Ooh, that's some good shit.

Sit down, homes.

Now I don't usually ask
too many questions,

but when a guy comes
into my house,

that I've never seen before

and wants a piece, yo,

I get a little curious.

Yo, man, it's cool.
Hector sent us.

Have you ever used
one of these before?

What the fuck, dude?

What the fuck did you just say?

You think we're just gonna
hand you a loaded piece?

You know what?
Call Hector, find out if it's cool.

Sorry about that. It's cool.

Just... I guess we need it
for the next job.

Damn.

A job, man.

You know, just 'cause
you got a gun,

don't make you an armed-robbing
gangster, homes,

so you better be careful
fucking with Hector.

Hector okayed it.

Make sure the chamber's empty.

Damn. I guess you have
used one of those before.

Man. Look, lemme get
your number. Please?

You want my number?

Yeah.
Why?

So we can fucking
hang out and stuff.

You'd drive all the way out to fucking
Long Beach just to hang out with me?

Don't be cute.
What's your problem?

I thought you liked me cute.

You like to tease, don't ya?

I don't tease.

Do you want my number or what?

Oh fuck yeah.
I want your number.

See, that wasn't too hard.
Whatever.

Yo, man, let's get the fuck outta here.
I'm done.

Dude, where the fuck
you been, man?

Hey, let's just chill
for a bit. Come on.

No, man, fuck that.
I'm leaving.

Look, let's just fucking chill
15 more minutes, all right?

Come on, man.
Fuck that. I got the keys, I'm leaving.

If you wanna walk, that's fine with me.
Let's go, dude.

Fuck this, dude.
You're outta here? Later, bro.

The fuck was that? Do you remember
what happened last time?

Dude, fuck off.
I was just flirting.

Don't be stupid. They're Hector's guys.
Whatever.

Yo, dude. I'm sorry
for being late, man.

You pull this shit again
and you're out of the fucking games.

You hear me?
Yeah, dude.

It's not gonna
happen again, all right?

Thanks. Day just...
Go get the rest of your gear on.

All right, man.

Yo, dude,

where's Jesse at, man?

He's chosen to be a fuck-up.

I'm glad to see you
back here though.

I got it, man.

At least you can keep
your priorities straight.

Hey, sexy.
What's up?

Yeah.

Ready to hang out or what?
Yeah, how are you?

Good. How are you?
Good to see you.

I always wanted a boyfriend
with a nice car.

Wait, what? Boyfriend?
Yeah.

Park in the corner.

Is this close enough for you?

Because this is pretty fucking far
from the entrance of the mall.

It's good enough for me.

Is it good enough for you?

We'll just have to see then.

Yeah.

Did you come already?

Fuck, man.

Look, it usually takes me
a lot longer. I just...

Babe, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

So, you know,

I'm not doing this
with any other guy.

Cool. I mean, even if you were,

why does it even matter to me?

Because you're my boyfriend.

And it should matter,

because I don't
just fuck anybody.

Fuck. I'm sorry, okay?

Let's just get outta here.
I don't wanna be at this fucking mall.

It sucks.
Serious?

Where are you trying to go right now?

I don't know.

What's there to do
around your house?

Burbank? Honestly, I'm not trying
to go all the way to Burbank

and then bringing you
all the way back to Long Beach.

I don't think that's happening.

Okay, fine, then why don't I just
stay with you for a while?

I don't know. That's...
I don't think that's gonna work.

What?! You got another girlfriend
back in Burbank or something?

No no no, stop being stupid.
Don't want me to come stay with you?

Look, it's my mom.
She works long hours

and she just doesn't like me
bringing people home.

She's weird about things, okay?

It's not gonna work.
Whatever.

Just sneak me in through
the window or something.

I don't even care.
Your mom's not gonna know.

Fuck. You're trouble.
You know that?

Mom! Mom!

Mom!

It's okay. She's cool.

Okay.
Mom!

What?
Hey.

Hi, baby.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

This is Dani.
Oh, okay. Hi.

My name's Julie.
It's nice to meet you.

Look, Dani and I are just gonna be
hanging out in my room for a bit, okay?

Okay, that's fine.
Yeah?

Yeah.
All right.

Oh, but can you guys
keep it down?

I was gonna read my rosary.
Yeah, of course.

No problem.
And it was nice to meet you.

Uh-huh.
See? That wasn't too bad.

So your mom is, like,
super Catholic, huh?

She just goes to church a lot.
I told you she wasn't gonna like me.

She likes you.
She thinks I'm a whore.

No, she doesn't.

Well, with you I can be.

Wow, you...
Shut up.

You heard your mother.
She doesn't want to hear a thing.

This is it, man.
I'm cutting you loose.

I'm getting Jesse back.
He's fucking good.

What, the young punk
with the fucking tattoos?

Come on, Hector.
He's a dead giveaway.

Listen, look at me. I'm clean.

Right? That kid's just
asking to be pulled over.

Now I know this town,
I know all the back ways.

Jesse doesn't know shit.
Are you fucking second-guessing me?

Like a I could give
a fuck what you think.

You remember what I told you?

You'd be lucky if you got
another chance again,

so this is it.
Don't worry.

I... I haven't been
doing so much shit...

...anymore.
Yeah yeah yeah.

Why don't you just
go back to selling cars,

go back with your old lady, man?

You ain't cut out
for this driving shit.

I can't go back, man.
There's not enough money.

I mean, if I don't do this,

I'm gonna lose the house.

If I lose the house,
I'm gonna fucking lose her.

Yeah, well, this is it for you.

Be back at 8:00
and have my fucking money.

All right.
Hold on.

What?
Look, motherfucker.

What the fuck?
Have my fucking money.

Don't fuck with me.
I'll personally kill you myself.

Have my money, be back here by 8:00.
You got me, motherfucker?

Okay, I got it. Fuck.
Get the fuck outta here.

Fucking car business.

Anybody order an Oldsmobile Cutlass?
Ah!

What's up, brother?
What's up, bro?

How you doing?
All right. Fellas, just in time.

Sit down, have a drink with me.

Yeah, we'll do that.

Drinking that high-powered stuff.

That's how we do it here.

Salud.
Salud.

How'd it go, man?

Oh! The delivery went good.

Cool. Good to hear some fucking
good news for once.

Well, not all good news, homes.

Hey, Steph, how you been?

Good. So, um,

you're like best friends
with my brother now?

I mean, your brother's a cool guy.

He's just
showing me a few things.

He taught you how to ride.

You know, it'd be a great idea
if we all went down to the track

and I can actually
show you what I've learned.

It'd be cool.
Oh, uh, yeah.

Yeah, you know, it may be kind
of hard for me to get out there

with work and... you know.

So it was good
to see you, Johnny.

Yeah, you too.

Yo, what was your deal back there, man?
What's with the heat?

How about you don't
fucking worry about it?

We got places to be. Besides,
I thought you had a girl now anyways.

I do. It's fucking nothing, man.

Well, let's get
the fuck outta here.

So anyway, I spoke
with Mark and Gilbert.

They said you guys did
a real good job the other night,

real professional.
I appreciate that extra pick-up too.

Yeah, no problem, man.

Next time give 'em a heads up
so it can speed shit up a little bit.

Don't take this shit personal.

Gilbert and me go way back.

He's a real close homey of mine.

I'm gonna leave the distribution
of that up to you.

A'ight, cool.

Damn, dude.
Business is killing it, huh?

Hey, man,
shut the fuck up, dude.

Dude, what the fuck, man?

Pleasure doing business
with you, man. Till next time.

Yeah, okay.
See you later, man.

Hold up a second, fellas.

Gilbert did mention
one little problem.

His niece Danielle?
She ain't been home in about a week.

That shit just wouldn't look good
if one of my drivers

was nutting up my homeboy's niece,

especially her being 16 and all.

You guys don't know shit
about that, do you?

Oh hell no.

Don't know nothing about that shit.
Not me, man.

No? All right.
No.

See you next time.

Let's get outta here, guys.

And I moved myself exactly
under the center of the bed.

What the fuck, Johnny?

How old are you?

Don't fuck with me right now.
How old are you?

I'm fucking 17.

Fuck! Fucking Mark
and Gilbert spoke, man.

What the fuck?
How did you even find out?

Hector, the guy that owns
the dealership in the Valley.

Oh, fuck that guy.
He's an asshole.

Look, have you even talked to anybody
since you've been staying with me?

Babe, chill the fuck out, okay?

Look, you need to go. Now.

What?! But you're my boyfriend. I...
Boyfriend?

Get your fucking shit.
Let's go.

Still nothing, huh?

Well, boss, I've been
checking around.

Nothing.

See what I get for giving
that bitch-ass weasel another chance?

I should never have fucked
with him again.

Mr. Nice Guy, huh?
That's what I get.

So what you want me
to do, boss?

Hold on.

This is Louis. You know what...
Oh fuck.

Want me try to find him?

Piece of shit like that
can't get too far.

Motherfucker.
All right, here's what you do.

Go to his fucking house,

and as soon as that motherfucker
pulls up, you call me.

I got something for his ass.

Got it.

You've reached Jesse.
Leave a message.

Jesse, hey.

Soon as you get this
fucking message, call me.

I got another job for you.

Let's fucking pin it, dude.
What's your deal, dude? You good.

Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

Fuck. All right.

Dude, do you know
how fucking early it is

to be doing that shit, dude?
Seriously, man.

Calm the fuck down.
This is getting fucking ridiculous.

Get me out of this fucking...
get me out of the Valley, bro.

This is bullshit, dude.
I'm fucking over it, man.

You know what, dude?

Both of you shut the fuck up.
Fuck!

Johnny, just drive.

Is it here? I'll pull over.

Dude, I know one thing...

Jesse's gotta meet up
with this guy,

but this guy's fucking sketchy, dude.

What the fuck are you doing here?

I'm here to collect for Hector.

Just step away from the house, man.

You fucking punk.

Step away from the fucking house!

Ow! Fuck! Ah!

Shit! Ah!
Fucking whoa, Jesse!

Jesse, what the fuck, bro?
Jesse, what the fuck?!

Jesse, what the fuck, dude?

Dude, get off him.
Get the fuck off this guy.

Junkie motherfucker.
You punk, you want your fucking money?

You motherfucker.
Fuck you, fucktard.

There!
Let's go.

You tell Hector to go fuck himself!
Let's get out of here, bro.

We've got the...
dude, what the fuck, Jesse?

Fuck this guy, man.
Get off my fucking property,

you motherfucking faggots!
Fuck you, bitch.

Fuck, man.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

You get everything, bro?

You got it?

Fuck you! Fucking motherfucker.
Fuck you!

Fucking count the money, dude.
What the fuck was that about, man?

Are you fucking crazy?
It was business, dude.

Fucking business.
Business pistol-whipping someone?

Fucking just bitch-slap the guy.

You don't fucking pull heat, bro.

Dude, of course Hector
told you to do it, so you did, huh?

Hey, look, listen, motherfucker.

I ain't no one's bitch, dude.

I do Hector's jobs,
yeah, of course.

Only the ones I want to.

If I feel like pistol-whipping
his ass to get paid,

then that's what
the fuck I'm gonna do.

What the fuck?
What does she want, man?

Yeah, what is it?
Hey, I need you to come pick me up.

Are you serious? Why?

I got kicked out.
Can you come get me or what?

I have no place to go.
Oh man. Fuck.

Um, yeah yeah yeah, whatever.

I'll... yeah, I'll be right there,
all right?

Fuck, man.
Man, clip that bitch.

Jesse, it's David.

Yo, come in.

Somebody's having a party.

Just hanging out, dude.
What the fuck you doing, man?

I'm just chilling, dude.
Just hanging out.

You messed up, Jesse.

Yeah, I know, dude.
I fucked up big time.

Look, I want you to come back,

but I can't let you do this shit again.

Just blowing it, dude.

Look, whatever personal bullshit's
taking you away from your riding,

you've gotta get a handle on it now.

I want you to ride in the games.

You do?
Yeah, I do,

but all this better be over with.

Dude, I got a few things
I gotta handle

leading up to the 19th,

but I can assure you

that shit'll be handled by then.

I'll be there and I'm gonna
fucking kill it...

like I always do.
You know how I do it, man.

You gotta get that?

No, man, it's cool.

Look, I already gave you
a second chance.

Don't mess this one up.

I told you a long time ago
that I wasn't gonna give up on you.

Why not, dude?
Everyone else has.

Oh, cut the self-pity crap.

Let me tell you
something, Jesse...

when I watch you ride,
talent just pours off of you, man.

Kids would line this fucking street

and give you anything
for half of what you got.

But good comes easy for you.

And you and I both know
you can be great.

And that's the difference
between the rider who wins

and the rider who looks good
in practice

but can't perform when
it comes time to deliver.

Dude, you know me, dude.
I got this shit.

I told ya... I'm gonna have everything,
all this shit sorted out.

I'll be there and not only that,

I'm pretty confident
I'm gonna fucking win, dude.

All right.

Thanks, Dave.
I appreciate it, man.

I needed that.
Look, I'm not gonna give up on you,

because I know you can get there.

But you're gonna have to want this
more than anything,

especially more than this.

I do, man. I'm fucked.

Dude, this shit's fucked up.

Well, get it sorted out.

All right, dude.
Good looking out, man.

Fuck!

What up, guy?

It's good, man.
I brought you the shit

you're gonna need
when you take over my run.

Fuck, man, I was wondering
when you were coming.

I mean, my fucking money's running out.
My bills are stacking up.

It's like a fucking disaster.

Man, you're a dumb-ass.

I can't believe you've still got
that chick with you, man.

If you had any fucking idea,
you wouldn't even be talking.

So fucking worth it,
let me tell you.

Yeah, you're gonna think
it's worth it

when Mark and Gilbert
come and fuck you up.

Why the fuck would they even care
if they kicked her ass out?

She told you that?
Yeah.

And you're the fucking dumb-ass
that believed her.

Why wouldn't I, dude?
She wouldn't fucking lie.

Hey, first off, bitches lie.

The second shit goes down,

she's gonna throw you under the bus
to save her own cute little ass

and you're fucked.

Look, I'll just have her call
and tell her fucking peeps

that she's been staying at a friend's
house and that's fucking that.

It ain't a big deal.
Hey, you do what the fuck you gotta do.

Just don't let Hector find out,

especially if you're
taking over my run.

All right.
Look, bud, I gotta go.

You gotta break this shit up.

Rudy and David are waiting
for me at the track,

so I gotta get ready.

It's a fat-ass sack.

It's gonna be on
at the contest, dude.

I'm winning my second medal.
That's fucking sweet, dude.

Rudy's gonna be there. Your girl Steph
might make an appearance.

Fuck. Steph?

Yeah, Steph.
Can you handle that?

Gonna get all emotional on me?
Yeah, dude, it's whatever.

I'll be there.
Get it fucking handled, dude.

I don't wanna have to come
back here and beat your ass.

Get your head more
over the bars on that one.

Sweet!

A man came up with an invention

to make himself a lot of money.

He was a mean old man
and cared about no one

but himself.

This is Rod.
He goes to school...

Jonathan, can I speak to you?

What is it?
I need to speak to you alone.

Now.

Hey, you.
Oh my goodness.

That girl is not welcome
in my house anymore.

Why? She's my...
Oh, your girlfriend?

Johnny, I don't understand
what you're doing anymore.

You come home
at all hours of the night.

Sometimes you don't
come home at all.

I don't see you going
to school anymore.

And now you're hanging around
with a piece of trash girl?

Mom, you really act like you
don't want me to enjoy my life.

Of course I do, baby,

but not by behaving
irresponsibly and...

and stealing.

Stealing? I'm not stealing!

Then where are you getting that car?
Shh.

I don't give a shit.
Your phone?

Your clothes? Huh?

Look, I pay for things, okay?

I don't see you paying
for anything around here.

Maybe the things you want.

Johnny, look,

if you wanna
continue to live here,

there's gotta be
some changes. All right?

Starting with her.

What are you trying to say?

You're kicking us out?
It's girls like that

the reason your father's gone.
Don't you understand?

Ohh.

I love you.

I love you too.

All right.

Come on.

Yeah?

Hey, it's Johnny.
Listen, Jesse wanted me

to finish this deal,
so that's why I'm calling.

Okay, all right.
You got the address?

Yeah, I got it.
All right, well, my homey wants

a beach ball too. 250, right?
Gonna be 300.

300?
I can't cut you down, man. I'm sorry.

It's like a fucking
transportation fee.

Transportation fee? Bullshit.

Fucking 300
or no fucking deal, man.

I don't have time for this shit.

Whatever, man.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

All right, I'll be there in 20.

Fuck.

Ahh.

Here we are
in Temecula, California.

72Âº outside
and we've got the world's

greatest riders here
at the Pala Raceway,

home of the 12th Annual
FMX Games.

Look at that. Nice.

Looks like the riders
brought their "A" game today.

Let's see who's
gonna win this contest.

How are you feeling, bro?
Yo, I'm good, man. I'm good.

All right, listen.
Don't let this crowd

get in your head
and fuck with you.

Just stay loose and relaxed
and have fun out there, man.

Give 'em a show.
I got this. Don't worry about it, dude.

All right.

How's the bike? Good?

It's all good, man.
I'm killing it.

Wow.

Big double nac
for Ronny Faisst!

Very impressive.
What a great run.

That's gonna get him
into the next qualifying round.

Up next, Jesse Meyers.
Whoo!

And a near-perfect ride
from Jesse Meyers.

Let's go, let's go. Come on.

Hurry the fuck up.
Let's go, let's go.

What's up, man?
Let's go.

We're wasting time, man.
Go out, make a right right here.

There's a fucking...
a fucking cop over there, man.

Just fucking make a right
right here, dog.

Sick, man!
Way to bring it, bro.

Dude, thanks.
What did I tell you?

That was awesome. Nice run. Nice run.
Told you I had that shit.

Nice run.
Yeah. You killed it out there, man.

You looked so good.
Thanks, pal.

Hey, Rudy, you're on deck, bro.
Pull your balls out, man.

You've got some shoes
to fill after that run.

Dude, I got this all day.
Do it!

Hey, dude, I couldn't say
with David being around here,

but this phone's been
ringing off the hook, man.

Hector?

Fuck, man.
That's your deal now, buddy.

I gotta ride.
I got a contest to win.

All right, man.
Get some, pussy.

Got this all day, guy.

Go, Rudy! The best, baby!

And up next, a rider
that's in it to win it...

Rudy Bronson.

Fuck!

All right, so what's up?
Let's do this.

You got that white horse?
You got that fucking money?

I got that fucking money, man.

Calm your ass down.
Let me see the money. Shit.

Now where's the fucking rest,
you shiesty-ass bitch?

What?! Hey,
do you know what, man?

Fuck your fake ass, motherfucker.
No, fuck you, man.

Fuck me?
This is a fucking waste of time.

Fuck me? Fuck you.
I'm taking your ass home.

Fake-ass motherfucker.
Fuck, man.

Hey, homey, make a quick
left right here, dog.

Fucking shit, man.
He's gonna burn me.

Yo.
Where the fuck are you at?

Yo, man, I'm at the fucking
contest right now, dude.

I can have Johnny take care of it.

Fuck Johnny! He's banging
my homeboy's niece.

Think I'm gonna send
some little fucking shit like that

to do a big job like this?
He can do it, man.

Fuck!
Don't ever put

your personal bullshit
over me, you hear me?

You be available
when I fucking need you.

You remember that?
It's part of the job.

Fuck, man.
If you send Johnny to do this job,

I'll have Gilbert and Mark
waiting for him there.

You got it?
You know what?

You know what,
you motherfucker?

I'm on my way. Fuck you.

So I got some more forks
coming on Tuesday

to try out, yeah.

Is that Jesse?
What the fuck's he doing?

Hey, Jesse!

Make a right up here, man.
Yeah, that's exactly

what I'm gonna do
right now, all right?

Right here.

Yeah yeah yeah,
hold your fucking horses.

Jesse, where are you going?
That's none of your business.

Jesse, please don't do this again.
Look, I said...

you wouldn't
understand, anyways.

Jesse, please.
You're my brother and I love you.

Please don't do this again.

I said just let me go.
Jesse, no.

No, please don't do this.

Fuck. It's the cops, man.

Dude, pull over!
They'll get us, man.

Pull over, pull over, pull over!
Shit! Fuck!

Pull over! Pull over!
Man!

Fuck you, man! Motherfucker!
Maury, get out!

Fucking motherfuckers! Fuck, man!
Stop, you're under arrest!

Stop or I'll shoot!
Get out of the car!

Put your hands up! Get out of the car.
All right! Fuck!

What the fuck I tell you?
Get out of the car!

David, where is Meyers?
I know, I know.

He'll be here.
I have finalists that need to run.

If he's not here, he's out.
Just give us five minutes.

This is not his first rodeo.
If he's not here, he's gone.

Look, don't disqualify him.
Meyers is out.

Come on, don't do this to us!

Fuck!

Fuck, man.
Come on, man, take it easy.

You got knives
or weapons on you?

No, I got no guns on me.
Got any drugs?

No.
Anything you wanna tell me about?

No, sir.
Nothing, man. Just driving through,

fucking trying to get home.
I'm fucking clean.

That ain't my shit, all right?
It was in your pocket.

Any marijuana?
No, I'm clean man.

What's this?
Look at this. What's that?

It is what it is. Fuck, man.

Got a pipe over there.

This isn't your neighborhood.
Relax, all right?

I'm not from the area.
Fuck.

Yeah?
Yeah.

You always walk around
with $100 bills in your wallet?

Gotta buy things.
Would that test positive for cocaine

if we put a test on that?
Let's go.

It's about time.
Dude, don't give me no shit.

I just came from Riverside.

All right, man.

Come check this shit out.

You mind if I give it a taste?

No, go for it.

So what you do
out there in Riverside?

I ride motocross.

Mmm.

I think we all good here, dog.

Wanna do me a favor
and grab that other box?

Sure, man. Why not?

Nice doing business with you.
All right, man.

Come on, man.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

Gimme that.

Fuck you, man.
Fuck you, man!

Fuck you.
Look at me. Look at me.

Payback's a bitch, huh?

I know, I know.

Take off your shoes.

All right, go through.

Hello?

Dani. Look, I'm so glad you...

you stuck around.
Johnny, where have you been?

Look, look,
just calm down, okay?

Look, as soon as...
Jesse's dead.

He left in the middle
of the fucking games.

What?

Johnny...

"Mom, you were right all along."

I don't know how I got
caught up in this mess.

I should've listened to you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for everything.

I just hope you can forgive me.

I love you and I know
I don't deserve you as a mother.

I know I've made mistakes,
but I swear to you

I will change.

"I have changed."

"I will try my hardest to be the man"

you want me to be.

I love you.

"Your son Johnny."

Hello?
Hello? Hello?

What?

What do you mean, "What?"

What the hell, Dani?
I've been calling you for weeks.

Why haven't you answered
any of my phone calls?

You left me in a fucking
motel room, Johnny.

Mark had to come pick me up.

What else was I supposed to do?

I've been fucking locked up.

Listen, Johnny, I don't wanna
be with you anymore.

I got your room ready.

Thanks, Mom.

I never wanna
go back there again.

I ever catch you dealing
or doing drugs again,

I'll call the police myself.

I'm just glad
to be out, you know?

Good.

I love you.

Love you too, Mom.

Hey, Johnny.
Here's some legit paper for you, baby.

Hey, Bill. What's up, man?

Thanks.
Doing all right.

Is it good?
Yeah, totally, man.

Thank you.
You got it, man.

Hey, Bill, listen,

I just wanted
to take the opportunity

to actually thank you
for letting me come back.

I mean, you really don't know
how much this means to me.

It's all cool, man.
Just remember,

we all make mistakes, man.
I've done it. I've screwed up.

Get over it.
Move on, all right?

Cool.
Cool.

Gain some weight, man.
You're looking skinny. It's a gym.

So I hope you liked it

and I hope we get
to see you soon.

Thank you so much.
That was great.

Hey, Steph.
Oh! Hey.

Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you or anything.

No, Bill told me you were back.

Yeah, I've been back
a few days.

Look, I was... I was just wondering
if you had a few minutes to talk.

I mean, it's been awhile,
you know?

Catching up and stuff.

Um, yeah.

I... I can take five now.

Awesome. Cool.

Look, I just wanna tell you

I'm really sorry about Jesse.

It's not your fault.

I mean, he knew what
he was getting into.

So when did you get back?

A couple days ago.

You're really lucky.
You know that?

Yeah, I know.
A second chance, right?

Yeah.

I hope you don't
fuck this one up.

Look, I'm trying
really hard not to.

Really.
Good.

Well, I guess I'll see you around.

Listen, I was just
wondering if maybe

you would be down to hang out
sometime outside of work,

like the good old times,

like you, me, Jes... Rudy.

And we can hit the track...
I kind of started dating someone.

No, I just meant as friends.

If that's cool.
I'd like that.

All right. Good.

Okay. See you around.

Okay.
