(dramatic orchestral music)

There.

That's better.

Well, my friends, how are you?

Oh don't answer that question, I can see.

Young and healthy, cool,
calm, and collected.

And contented.

And so you should be contented.

You all lead custody lives.

You're carried from adventure to adventure

in your warm, comfortable trunk.

And who carries you?

I do.

A frail, fragile old man.

Do I need (mumble)?

Next time I cut off your feet, and I'll

put you up on wheels, and you can

all pull me along in the trunk.

Oh don't look so worried,
it may never happen.

Well we'll rest here tonight, and tomorrow

we'll be safe in Switzerland.

Now let's see if I can find
something for us to eat.

(dramatic cello music)

Well I found this tin of sardines.

All I need now is a tin opener.

What is it?

What have you found?

Well...

Well.

Cyclops.

Cyclops.

He was one of the first of the family.

It all began, I suppose...

One day with old Afzel in Cairo long ago.

(music intensifies)

(speaking foreign language)

Those who steal the
secrets of the Gods must die!

Those who steal the
secrets of the Gods must die!

Feel the power of Sutekh!

Feel the power of Sutekh!

(otherworldly sounds)

(sigh of relief)

No so powerful as once he was,

this god of yours.

One day he will be just like his temples.

Die, sorcerer!

Die, sorcerer!

Yes.

I will die.

But not today.

(speaking foreign language)

No, Sutekh, not today.


Rise from the sands!

Rise from the dead!

Awaken!

Breathe!

Live!

Who am I?

You are Sutekh, our lord.

Most holy and terrible.

Sutekh, most holy and terrible.

Sutekh, most holy and terrible.


Your slave.

Your slave.

Your slave.


A sorcerer has stolen my great
secret, the secret of life.

He flees now to (mumble)
with the infidels.

Disguise yourselves and follow him.

Destroy him and all to
whom knows my secret.

Hear my command!

All who learn the secret of life must die!

Go, slaves!

Come.


The world was younger then.

And so indeed was I.

(whimsical orchestral music)

Let's begin.

(triumphant orchestral music)

Ilsa please just wait!

Wait a moment.

Where are you going?

Where am I going?

Margarette, we're in Paris.

Don't you want to see it?

We see it every day.

Shopping, the proper places with

chaperones, that's not Paris.

Do you know Paris doesn't even

wake up until after midnight.

There's excitement out there, magic.

I want to find it.

If your father finds out you're

sneaking off in the middle of the night,

you'll find yourself being shipped

back home to Geneva.

Being cooped up in here and trotted off

to dance with old men at embassy balls,

we might as well be back in Geneva.

Besides, he won't do anything
if he doesn't find out.

Okay, but please be careful and don't

go into any opium dens.

(uplifting orchestral music)

Mademoiselle, am I not a pathetic sight?

Did you ever imagine the depths

to which a boy could sink?

I...


Ease your conscience.

I can use the money and I'm sure

it'll make you feel so much better.

I...

All right.

There.

I sure you feel so much better.

Good crowd tonight.

Wonderful.

Come, positions, everyone!

Hey, where's Vigo?

Last minute repairs.

Ah, it's two minutes
before curtain time.

He's not a professional.

Please, positions.

Monsieur Vigo, at your convenience,

we would like to begin.

Yeah, I'm almost ready, Andre.

Almost ready.

There, perfection.

I'm happy for you both.

Please, take your place.

You worry too much, Andre.

It is fashionable to be late.

Fashionable for the
audience, not the production.

Hurry, let's go!

All in position?

Good.

(dramatic violin music)

(drum rolling)

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like

to welcome you to the real world.

A world of magic, of
gods, and of monsters.

Here, all familiar illusion
will be swept away.

Here, all things become one...

Of terror and wonder.

Heaven and Hell.

Fear and desire.

I give you The Theatre Magique,

where all things are possible.

(classical piano music)


I can see better than any other two.


then perhaps none would
be better than one.

frightening place is this?


feel the heat of the flames.

nowhere else but Hell.

Hell, for we are the damned.

(eerie violin music)

(horses clomping)

He's left the nest.

Go, quickly, follow him.

Follow him.

Follow him.

Approach him from behind.

Do not let him suspect.

Then kill him.

Afterwards, there will be more money.

Don't you worry, sir.

You can depend on us.

Do not fail!

Do not fail.

Do not fail.

We won't.

We won't.


Let us escape.


puppets dancing on a string.


at the whim of the puppeteer.


Into the fire with you
all, and with me as well,

and thus the comedy ends.



[Second Servant] Why do we not attack?

Why use them?

[First Servant] Why?

He senses us.

He knows when we approach.

And he has power.

Do you think they can kill him?

Yeah, can they kill him?

He is mortal.

If he is caught unaware.

And if not, no loss.

(dramatic orchestral music)


(suspenseful violin music)



Help, help!

Police, police!

Let's get outta here, let's go!

Police!

Oh dear, oh no.

Help!

Help!

Open the door!

Open the door please!

Please help, a man's been attacked!

(conversing in French)

What did they say, what
are they going to do?

To do?

Well since there's neither a bribe nor

a loose morale mademoiselle attached to

the complaint, I suspect
they'll do nothing.

I'm afraid he's right, these

sort of things are rather common.

I wanted to thank you for helping.

It was my pleasure.

The old man.

Well?

If he wakes in the next
hour, he should recover.

If he doesn't, he probably won't.

But why would they want to kill him?

Some men don't need a reason.

Mademoiselle, can we escort you home?

Oh, no, no, no thank you.

Valentin, get her a carriage.

I live to serve.

I saw you in the theatre.

And I saw you.

That is, of course I saw you.

Have you been doing this for long?

The puppets, I mean.

All my life.

Really?

Well it was very nice to meet you.

Obviously, the circumstances...

The circumstances
could've been better, yes.

Yes, you have to forgive me, this

sort of thing doesn't
happen to me very often.

Well never, in fact.

With the men in the alley.

You did very well for your first time.

Her majesty's carriage awaits.

Yes, I really should, my father...

That is, I should be going.

Goodnight.

Good evening.

Did you enjoy the show?

Oh, it was interesting.

Now there's a diplomatic answer.

I liked it very much.

Then come again, please.

I'll, I'll try.

Good evening, monsieur.

Andre.

Andre.

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Oh Andre!

Shut it.

[First Servant] Afzel still lives.

[Second Servant] He still lives.

[First Servant] I sense
him, he is weaker at least.

Weaker, but now what?

Now what?

It will be harder now.

He has known of us from the beginning.

He senses us.

He waits for us.

But we must choose the time
and the place to strike.

We cannot fall no more.


(dramatic bass music)

You should try to attract a more

working class (mumble), Andre.

They're always more generous to

poor, helpless unfortunates like me.

These rich bastards, squeezing a

sous out of them is like real work.

I'll see what I can do for you.

Make some girl puppets, naked ones.

Maybe a sort of puppet (mumble).



I thought you just
coughed for your customers.

Is it real now?

To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure myself.

You're both a gentleman
and a scholar, Andre.

I'm neither.

Goodnight.

I suppose you'll have to do.

Oh, you're awake.

How are you feeling, you
were attacked by some...

I know what happened to me.

Is there anybody you'd
like me to send for?

Family, friends?

I've had no living relatives

for almost 2,900 years.

Oh, I see.

Put that thing down and come over here.

Sit.

Listen carefully and do not interrupt.

My name is Afzel, I am a sorcerer.

Born in Egypt some 3,000 years ago,

but now I'm being pursued by the

servants of an elder god named Sutekh.

They pursue me because I
stole the secret of life.

The power to place the soul of

a man inside a dead thing...

And make it live.

But now I am dying.

I cannot be saved, but
the secret must be saved.

The elder gods bide their time.

When they rise 100 years from now,

a thousand, nothing but the secret

of life may save humankind, I will

teach it to you, do you understand?

Yeah, I see, I understand.

You're a 3,000 year
old sorcerer from Egypt

and you want to teach
me the secret of life?

But I think you should rest.

There will be plenty of time for

that tomorrow, don't you think,

I mean after 3,000 years, what
(speaking foreign language)

would one more night matter?

Is the old man mad?

Or is the young man a fool?

Look over there, young man.

(dramatic sting)

This is the secret of life?

They do not live, I use
them as you do, as puppets.

Now they are mere shells.

The will that drives them is mine.

The secret of life is very different.

Far more precious.

We can make your puppets truly

live as men live, with souls and wills.

What are they doing?

Carving signs of
protection for your doors.

It will make it harder for my enemies...

To find me.

(owl hooting)

Sometimes I think I must be going mad.

What?

What, I give you an opening like that

and you don't take advantage of it?

Bring him inside.

He's...

Dead, yes I know, it's fortunate for us.

Bodies are easier to find in the

streets of Cairo than
in the streets of Paris.

What are you talking about?

Did you think it was enough merely

to teach you theory?

To be a master, you must practice

what you have learned.

Think of it as a gift, sir, a rebirth

if that makes it easier for you,

but in the name of everything holy,

please get him inside before

somebody walks by, quickly!

(dramatic flute music)

Take it.

Tool of the art, I give it to you.

Careful.

(magical chime)

The ring does not matter.

It has no special power.

It is merely a tool, the
same is true with the fluid.

For our magic, it serves merely

as a bridge for the lifeforce.

Your soul.

Now...

Now the words.

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic bass music)

There, see?

See?

It cannot speak, of course.

But it lives.

It lives?

Do you know me?

Do you know what I have done?

Have I harmed you?

I need a little rest.

Afzel!

What?

Are you all right?

No, I'm dying, I told you that before.

But not right this moment.

But soon.

One day.

No more.

Is there anything I can do?

Yes.

The gift I have given you is
the most precious in the world.

Down through the centuries, armies have

fought and died for it.

Do not waste it.

(dramatic flute music)

Where are you?

Where have you gone?

Please come back, please!

Can you hear me?

Where are you hiding?

I don't mean to hurt you.

Please, stop it.

Come back.

Please come back!


(whispers in French)

Oh, it's...

Ilsa.

I hope I, well I can
see I didn't wake you.

Oh no, no.

May I come in?

Oh please, (mumble).

I hope you don't mind
my coming, I wanted to...

Well I would have come to the performance,

but sometimes it's rather difficult

for me to get away from home.

No, of course, I'm glad you came,

but you see...

How is he?

How is...

I'm sorry?

That poor old man, is he any better?

Oh, he's fine.

Oh that's good, I was rather worried.

He is, like I said,
asleep now of course.

I, I have a confession to make.

What, a confession?

Yes.

I didn't come only to
ask about the old man,

I came to see you.


Yes, I'm sure that's rather shocking,

a young girl coming out in the middle

of the night to meet
with a virtual stranger.

Or perhaps not.

After all, you are in the theatre.

I won't find it shocking at all,

I'm very glad you came.

But I'm afraid you'll have to go.

I'm sorry?

Yes, it's late you
see, and I'm very busy.

I see.

I must seem like a bit of a fool to you.

Please, it's not that, it's...

The old man is asleep.

Yes, I seem like a bit of a fool myself.

You don't understand.

No really, there's
nothing to understand,

you certainly owe me no explanation,

we really don't know each other at all,

really, I'm sure a man such as yourself,

you have many willing women and

I can hardly compare with their expertise.

Please listen to me.

I can't explain, but I
am very glad you came.

(glass shattering)


No, no, don't!

Keep your hands off me!

Oh, you.

You have no right to do this!

Please, mademoiselle, no scenes.

You'll pay for this.

Oh mademoiselle, I
have already been paid.

Keep your hands off her!

You are not going to put up a

struggle are you, mademoiselle?

Please take the mademoiselle.

don't expect an apology.

I am not sorry!

I'm not a child anymore and you had

no right to send this,
this watchdog of yours!

Oh, mademoiselle.

Please, leave us.

Yes sir.

Ilsa, I'm extremely disappointed in you.

If you do not wish to
be treated like a child,

you shouldn't behave like one.

Clearly you still have
some growing up to do

and I'm afraid Paris is
not the place to do it.

At the end of the week I'm going

to return you to Geneva.

Father...

In the meantime, of course, you

will not be permitted
to leave the embassy.

Father, I swear to you...

I'm sorry, Ilsa, my mind is made up.

Good evening.

Father!

Good evening.

(door slams)

(bell rings)

Who are you?

Why are you doing this?

Excuse me, young man,
but I'm rather tired.

It is past my bedtime.

I bid you goodnight
and good lesson, clown.

(dramatic sting)

[First Servant] I feel him.

[Second Servant] Feel him!

He is weak.

And he is close.

It is time to act.

Time to kill.

To kill.

To kill.

Come.

(dramatic violin music)

Oh, Valentin, is the door repaired?

Yes, my skills were able to

encompass this heroic enterprise.

(glass shatters)

(dramatic sting)

(slow motion) Hey, what the devil

do you think you are doing?

(otherworldly sounds)



(dramatic music)

(otherworldly sounds)


(otherworldly sounds)

At last, the rats have
come for the (mumble).

You are weak now, thief.

Your powers cannot match ours.

You must die, thief.

You must die, thief.

Yes.

I will die.

But not at your hands.

Sutekh will not lay claim to my death.

(otherworldly sounds)

I think he's dead.

All praise to Sutekh!

All praise to Sutekh!

All praise to Sutekh!

(horses clomping)

(dramatic bass music)

Oh my God.

(music intensifies)

I'm sorry, my friends.

I'm sorry I failed you.

And I'm sorry that I need your help.

Vengeance may not be the most noble

reason for living, but
for now, it is all I have.

(train bell ringing)

[Second Servant] It is he.

[Third Servant] It is he.

No, it is another.

That thief Afzel has given the

secret of life to another.

Then another must die.

Another must die.

Come.

(dramatic horn music)

(speaking foreign language)

Oh, my friend.

You've returned.

You're not frightened anymore?

I wish I wasn't.

Afzel?

Oh, I see.

Not Afzel.

Six Shooter then.

And Blade.

Drill Sergeant.

Doctor Death.

Cyclops.

And no longer my master?

Will you follow me?

Then we shall be avengers.

We shall be destroyers of evil.

It is no longer safe and there

will be too many
questions I cannot answer.

But I cannot come face to face

with your killers without protection.

Ah!

When Blade here is
finished, we will leave.

These devils can't fly, and if they're

returning to Egypt, there aren't

too many ways for them to go.

We will find them, I promise you.

Finished?

Lacking in amenities, I fear.

But by far the least conspicuous
means of transportation.

You've come looking for me.

Die!

(otherworldly sounds)

Not so easy to kill me.

Die on your knees, thief!

Bow down before the god you mock!

I bow down to nothing evil!


Not so easy to kill.

Kill!

(suspenseful music)



I think we will leave Paris, my friends.

There's nothing more for us here now.

Nothing more.


Live again!

That one is useless, he
cannot be brought back again.

Mighty one, the thief Afzel is dead.

the secret of life.

Make no excuses, you have failed me.

We have failed.

Oh most holy and terrible one, Sutekh,

whose heart is the very blackness of time.

I beg you.

Give us the power to do your will.

To kill this thief.


do not use it too much.

All praise to Sutekh!

[Second Servant] All praise to Sutekh!

(dramatic violin music)

One he loves.


please accept my most profound apologies

for any inconvenience and...

Inconvenience, are you mad?

Dear Andre.

Dearest Andre.

My dear phantom whom I
shall never see again.

Mademoiselle, may I be of some service?

No, no thank you.

Mademoiselle should be pleased to know

that when I retire, one of my most able

assistants will take my place.

I see.

So in the event that mademoiselle

requires any assistance, someone

would be available at all times.

You are so kind.

Hardly kind, mademoiselle.

Merely efficient.

Good evening.

Yes, good evening.

(dramatic bass music)

(horses clomping)

She is here?

You have a message for
the ambassador's daughter?

A message, yes.

Where is she?

Where is she?

Asleep in her room in
the West Wing, I presume.

Leave it here.

Leave it?

You said you had a message.

Yes.

Well what is it?

Die.

(otherworldly sounds)

Who are you?

What do you want here?

Sleep.

(otherworldly sounds)

Take her.

(music intensifies)

You, stay!

Die.

(otherworldly sounds)

Of what use is she to
us if he does not know?

He will know.

I will send him the
dream and he will know.

But how can you send him a dream

if we do not know where he is?

By the power of Sutekh, all who

sleep and dream in the city tonight

will have the same nightmare.

But one will know that it
is more than a nightmare.

And he will come to us.

Your life for hers, (mumble).

Come to us all.

I have a ticket on the
morning train to Calais.

Yes?

Is there any other
train leaving tonight?

Well not to the...

Anywhere, please!

Well there's the night
train to Marseille.

The 2:05, but you're going
to have to hurry to catch it.

A ticket please, quickly.

Why the change in plans?

Give me the blasted ticket!

Okay?

(whistle blowing)

(train horn blowing)

welcome aboard, monsieur.

Any seat that you would like, these here,

any seat in the first two cars?

Yes, thank you.

Can you please tell me have you seen

two strange men and a
young dark haired woman?

didn't see them, monsieur.

Perhaps you were misinformed?

Yes, perhaps, thank you.

(train horn blowing)

(dramatic violin music)

(suspenseful bass music)

(suspenseful violin music)

(door lock clicking)

It was I who sent the dream.

Let her go!

Come forward.

Come forward.

Let her go!

You have seen what this hand can do.

Come forward.

Is this what you want?

Afzel's secrets?

Afzel has no secrets.

It is a possession of Sutekh.

Born in the black fire
at the beginning of time.

His secrets.

How do you know that
this is the only copy?

You've not had time to make another.

If you have, I'll have

In Hell!

Live to see her die.

Puppet master.



(music intensifies)

(glass shatters)

(crunching sounds)

My friends, mission accomplished.

Are you all right?

I'm not quite sure.

You don't need to be afraid of them.

I'm afraid I've been rude, I haven't

made the proper introductions.

Ilsa, this is Cyclops,
Blade, Drill Sargent,

Doctor Death, Pinhead, and Six Shooter.

They are my very dear friends.

I'm very pleased to meet you all.

Very pleased.

(train horn blowing)

Very pleased.

What?

You want to know what happened to Cyclops?

And the others?

Well my friends, that is another story

which I will tell you at another time.

I see it's morning, and
the rain has stopped.

We should be in Switzerland by lunch time.

Safe at last.

(dramatic orchestral music)

(triumphant orchestral music)
