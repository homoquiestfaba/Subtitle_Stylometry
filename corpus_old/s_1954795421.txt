<i>Â¶ Kiro, news radio, 710 Â¶</i>

<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to</i> the Jack black show.

<i>I'm Jack black.</i>

<i>Before the break, we were talking
to Maggie from magnolia.</i>

<i>So, let me</i>
<i>get this straight, Maggie.</i>

<i>From an evolutionary</i>
<i>point of view,</i>

<i>men have basically outserved their
function as hunter/providers,</i>

<i>and according to you,</i>

<i>testosterone is going</i>
<i>to destroy the world?</i>

<i>Look, all I'm saying is</i>

<i>after 5 marriages, I think I know
something about men, you know.</i>

Ditz.

<i>I mean, there is a difference
between men and women.</i>

Duh!

<i>So you're saying...</i>

<i>What I'm saying is that</i>
<i>even when we're kids</i>

<i>girls are nurturers, boys
are aggressors, that's all.</i>

<i>Girls want to play with dolls,</i>
<i>and boys want to play with...</i>

Themselves? <i>Guns.</i>

<i>Men are what's wrong</i>
<i>with the world.</i>

<i>Well, ma'am,</i>
<i>speaking as Jack black,</i>

<i>your radio therapist,</i>

<i>I have just 2 words of advice:</i>

Stop whining! <i>Stop whining!</i>

Next caller.

<i>Next caller.</i>

<i>I don't know how you can</i>
<i>call yourself a therapist</i>

<i>when you don't believe</i>
<i>people should talk</i>

<i>about their problems.</i>
<i>Isn't modern therapy...</i>

hey, modern therapy
is the problem.

People wallowing in their own
pathetic guilt at $100 an hour

instead of just
getting on with it.

If more people listened to me,
fewer people would listen to me.

<i>But the work I've done</i>
<i>on my inner child</i>

<i>has really helped...</i>

sir, I've 2 words of advice
for your inner child:

Grow up!

Next caller.

<i>Yeah, hi.</i>

<i>Go ahead, caller.</i>

<i>I need you to help me.</i>
<i>To explain someone to me.</i>

Ashley, do you know
what time it is?

<i>Go ahead, bubba.</i>

<i>Yeah, I just wanted</i>
<i>to call and say</i>

<i>that your show</i>
<i>really offends me.</i>

<i>Where're you calling from?</i>

<i>I'm at home.</i>

<i>Someone got a gun to your head?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Then change the station! Next!</i>

<i>Yeah, dude.</i>

<i>Go ahead.</i>

<i>I listen to your show</i>
<i>every night.</i>

<i>I've been doing it for 3 years.</i>

<i>3 words of advice, my friend:</i>

Get a life! <i>Get a life!</i>

<i>Next caller.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Hello, Rochelle from...</i>

Ashley, honey.

You wanna give me a hand
with the groceries?

And please don't
listen to that garbage.

But it's daddy's show.

I know.

Joshua, when I said
grab a bag out of the car,

I meant something a bit bigger.

Ok, guys, let's go. Your father's
gonna be here any minute.

<i>I just have 2 words</i>
<i>of advice for you:</i>

Stop whining!

<i>Next caller.</i>

Hey, don't worry.
He'll be here.

Dad!

Hi, Joshua. Dad.

You guys ready to cruise? Hmm?

What's with
this research stuff?

They've been
looking forward to this.

They haven't spent quality time
with you since last summer.

It won't be a problem.

Right.

Come here. I love you guys.

You have a good time, ok?
Come here.

"Interstate 5."

"Exit 176."

"Exit 177."

"U.S.-Canada customs. 5 Miles."

How long is this ride, dad?

Just a second, Josh.

Yeah, Albert.
You have my numbers, right?

You can reach me on my cell, or if
that's busy, fax me in the car.

"Exit 301."

"Watch for falling rock."

"Welcome to glenorky,
home of orky."

It's about time.

Dad, who's orky?

I know it is only 4 weeks, Albert, but
I'll get it done. You have my word.

Dad?

Honey, can you get that, please?
It's somewhere in the back.

They can give you
brain cancer, you know.

Well, you can call me then.
He has my numbers, right?

Whoa! Major road kill.

Dad, I got a close-up
using the image...

2 words of advice, Al: Relax.

Did you say something, honey?

I just wanted to know
who orky was.

He's a stupid
tourist attraction.

Like the loch ness monster,
o vacant one.

Am I the only one
who hears that?

All I want to know
is if he's real or not?

What, honey?

That thing. Orky.

Probably some
ancient Indian myth.

You know,
some aboriginal deity.

Space, the final frontier.

Josh, get a life.

Dad, I bet
I could drive this thing.

Dad. One second.

Where are we?

I don't know.
We passed a bridge.

Left at the dairy queen?

I don't know. It's your map!

Ok, let's get started.
Hi, everyone.

Hi, Dr. Bell.

Today we have a new recruit.
Frank has come to us for help.

Frank, do you want to tell
the others what you told me?

Uh.

Hi.

Um, I'm, uh...

Bob.

Hi, Bob.

Hi, Bob.

Frank, it's ok
to use your real name here.

Oh, all right.

I'm Frank.

Hi, Frank.

Hi, Frank.
Hi.

And, uh, my body was

inhabited by.

Orky.

Oh, God.
See, now we're into it.

Ok, here we go.

I told you about orky, huh?

Uh, he was in my body.

Did you get
to go into his cave?

He was you
and you were him, right?

This isn't happening.
I'm not hearing this.

I don't believe in monsters
'cause monsters don't exist.

In his cave...

gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen!

Right.

Go ahead, Frank.

Well, at first,
I... I was scared.

And then

it was amazing.

I could actually breathe
underwater.

And when you came to, you
were building a sandcastle?

I don't believe in monsters,
'cause monsters don't exist.

It didn't inhabit my body,
I didn't become a fish.

Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gent-gentlemen!

Dad, is this it?

Looks like some demented tepee
or something.

We have a dock. Our own dock.

This is great!

Dad, come look!

Water.

Uncarbonated.

It's beautiful, isn't it?

You're just like your mother.

No, that's... that's good.
That's good.

Want to race to the beach?

On your marks, get...

wait, wait.

Hello.

Hello.

Â¶

Hi.

Â¶

"Dad's easter. June 20th."

I hate to tell you this, but I don't
think there's a cassette player.

That's ok,
I can hear them in my head.

I just locked that.

Yeah.

Leave it locked!

Chicken. Chicken.

I'm not chicken,
just close the damn window!

What are you chicken of?

Josh!

What is going on?

Hormones.

I asked him to close the window,
and he called me a chicken.

You're 2 rational human
beings, I've got work to do.

3 words: Deal with it.

Huh!

Daddy! Hey, dad!

Daddy!

Dad!

Dad!

The monster! He's real!
He ate my cookies.

You mean,
you lost your cookies.

Dad!

Greetings! I'm Joe pickled
trout, your property manager.

Dad! Orky, he ate my cookies!

Don't worry about it, honey.
Get you some more.

Morning.

It's really
my Uncle kipper's property.

He lives in the main house,
but he's past the day.

About 3 fries short
of a happy meal.

We keep him sedated.

I bet I could drive this.

How about this?

Only $500 extra for the month.

I could definitely drive that!

Aw, c'mon, dad!

Anyone for a tour?

It's on the house.

There hasn't been
a sighting since '89,

so business is kinda slow.

How long has this orky thing
been a tourist attraction?

Only since I took over.

My Uncle kipper's considered
himself a bit of a purist.

Hey, Joe!

Hey, Bobby. Hey, Mary Elle.

Now, he thinks
I've somehow gone commercial.

Here we are: Orky central.

Big bucks
scientific expedition.

The Japanese have developed
this new, super hi-tech radar

that can sweep the entire lake.

They just might find old orky, unless
he pulls one of his special tricks.

Tricks?

Native legend has it that he can
change himself into another animal.

Even a human being.

That's why
he's never been caught.

Bet I could drive that.

What would they do
if they found him?

Probably turn him
into a movie star.

More like giant Sushi.
Slice 'n' dice, baby.

Nah, he's considered
a sacred creature in Japan.

They wouldn't harm him. They just
want to get a closer look at him.

Who are those one-armed dudes?

They're the Hardy brothers.

They were working on the
docks at the mill one night,

when orky leapt right out of the lake
and took an arm off each of them.

Every time a new expedition
comes to town,

they follow right behind them,

waiting for the right moment
to get revenge.

They're out for blood.

Dad, could I ask you something?

Hold on, honey.

Mmm-mmm. Too sweet.

Why don't you go out and play?

There's nothing to do here.

Use your imagination.

Can I take the boat out and
go look for Ashley's monster?

Could be worth millions.

You know, for college.

Later.

Come on, guys,
I got work to do.

Go on. Get out of here,
will you?

Josh, can we go back now?

In a sec, ash.

I'm doin' a man thing here.

Staring death in the face.

Stuff like that.

God, Ashley, get a grip!

Phew!

Stinks!

I knew it! I knew it!

I just called
to say we arrived safely.

Why do we always
have to get into this?

Of course, I wanna
spend time with her.

Oh, yeah, sure!
That's right, Beth.

Just because I... hey, I took 'em
on this stupid vacation, didn't I?

What more do you want?

<i>That color becomes you.</i>

<i>You park here often?</i>

Sorry, it's a new toy.

One of these
talking security systems.

Hi. Jack black.

Wanda bell.

So do you park here often?

Uh, I have a patient here.
Sedatives.

Ah, you're a doctor.

Well, actually,
I'm a psychiatrist.

Really?

That makes us colleagues.

You're a psychiatrist?

Mmm-hmm.

How could anyone
be neurotic up here?

Can I help you with that?

You actually get business?

I escaped the city figuring that I'd
be practicing general medicine,

but when I got here,
I discovered a group of men

who all have
an identical psychosis.

What? Like a cult? End of
the world sort of thing?

No, they all believe they've been
inhabited by a lake monster.

Sorry.

There's nothing I want more than
to help them get well again.

Who's there?

I know that smell.
It's you, isn't it?

And catrina, who's my very
best friend at school,

well, her mom's
always forgetting her keys.

And this one time, we were at a softball
game, and she didn't have them,

so we had to use my brother's
bat to break the window.

No.

I don't remember
what she was wearing.

God! Can't you just find her?

Uh, missing child?

Mmm-mmm.

That's not mine.

Oh, no, no. He's mine.

Uh, I need a piece
of your daughter's clothing.

For my dog.

And the reason I could tell it was you
was because you have really bad breath.

No offense.

Mom says you get bad breath
when you're sick.

Are you sick?

Well, I'm only gonna
give you one more of these,

'cause if you are, I don't
want you getting any sicker.

None of us could breathe.

Guess I better find a place
to sleep.

Safe from wild animals
and highway perverts.

Ashley!

Ashley!

It's ok. I know what I'm doing.

Ashley!

Ashley!

Please. Hold on.

Ashley!

Ashley?

Oh, my God!

Help!

Help! Please.

I wasn't chasing monsters.

He'll be ok, ash.

There you are. Why don't you
come to the kitchen?

I'll make you some grapefruit
and free-range eggs.

Is he gonna die?

Oh, no, honey.

No. He's just had a mild
craniocerebral trauma.

A concussion.

When will he get better?

Dad! Ashley?

Ashley?

She's right here,
she's all right.

Ashley?

Dad!

Ashley, you're all right.

She's fine. Everybody's fine.

I thought...

Are... are you ok, dad?

Yeah, yeah. You're not hurt.

Dad, you saved me.

If you hadn't...
if you hadn't catched me...

Kids. Kids, let's give him
a chance to rest. Ok?

He'll be home very soon.

Jack, open your eye for me.

Whoa. Whoa. Keep it open.

I had the weirdest dream.

Ooh!

You're gonna die of melanoma.

I'm gonna die of boredom.

Hey!

You guys wanna have some fun?

Don't you guys want a turn?
Be a lot faster.

Wouldn't it be faster
just to take a plane?

Nah! This is the only way
to get to China.

I used to try this all the time
by myself when I was a kid,

but I could never get there
because I always had to do it

myself.

Yeah, I bet.

My dad never helped.

He was too...

Dad, I thought you said you
didn't remember your childhood.

That it was locked in the
deepest recesses of your mind.

It's ok, dad.
I'll help you dig to China.

Dad!

Isn't it time we did that father-son
bonding thing or something?

Huh?

Can't we do something normal?

Like take this puppy
out for a spin?

I'm supposed to wanna do
that kind of thing at my age.

It's a teen thing.

Too noisy.

Besides, we must be
gettin' close.

Yup! Shouldn't be long now.

Come on, dad. You promised.

Huh?

This is bullshit!

This place sucks!

Did I say somethin'?

What are we gonna do
with all this sand?

There was nothing
little Jackie wanted more

than to be a knight
at king Arthur's round table.

But everyone just said,

"It'll never happen, pal.
You're too puny."

Anyway, Jackie knew that
king Arthur's knights

were scheduled to fight
the mud people

the very next day on the top
of mud Mountain at noon.

So he got up early,
and he climbed the Mountain,

and he waited
by a small metal cross

embedded
in the top of the hill.

Pretty soon, he heard
the sound of marching.

But to his horror,
it was the mud people.

They had arrived an hour early
because they're mud people.

Anyway, mud people all around.

Jackie figured he'd better
do something.

So he pulled the metal cross
out of the ground.

But to his surprise,

the metal cross turned out
to be a huge sword.

Well, the mud people, they just
gurgled and laughed and...

Then something incredible
started to happen.

Mud Mountain began to tremble

and shake and grow.

And the shaking threw the mud
people off their slimy feet.

And Jackie just
stood there speechless

as the head
of this giant dragon

appeared and said:

"Gee, thanks, bubba.

That sword's been a pain
in my neck for a long time."

Because mud Mountain

was actually the back
of a giant dragon

that had been asleep
for centuries.

Jackie woke him up.

Yes, he did.

And all of king Arthur's
court cheered

as Jackie returned
riding his dragon.

Who he called Curtis,
because that was his name.

So what happened
to Jackie and Curtis?

Did they live
happily ever after?

No.

They just sort of lost touch.

It's not a very good ending.

No, it isn't, is it?

In fact, dad, it sucks.

<i>It's not fair!</i>

Why'd we even
rent the damn boat?

You're right, Josh.

We'll return the keys tomorrow.
They're on the table.

No, that's not what I mean.

This is seriously
affecting my development.

Joshua, look! He's havin' fun.

Dad, he's a moron.

Â¶

Hiro! Hiro!

Don't break this now.

You guys wanna hang out here
while I drop by Dr. Bell's?

I'll come with you.

No, no, thanks, honey.

It doesn't do anything.

Go on.

A hundred?

Enjoy yourselves.
I won't be long.

Dad, this is...

Frank.

Last time we met, you were describing
the euphoria you experienced

during your hallucination
with the monster.

Jack!

Everyone, th-this is, uh, Dr. Jack
black, a colleague of mine.

Hi, Jack.

Hi, Jack.

Uh, Jack, did you want
to join us?

Frank, do you have anything
you want to say?

Mmm-mmm.

Uh, uh, now, Frank,

why did this experience
make you happy?

Because he suddenly felt free.

Like a kid again.

Yeah,

yeah. Like a kid again.

Frank, do you have
anything to say?

No!

Frank, don't worry.

It'll pass.

Actually, it sort of
comes and goes.

What does?

Feeling scared.

Simon, why don't we let Frank
describe his own feelings.

How are you feeling, Frank?

Scared.

Now, Frank,
that's what Simon said.

I-I-it's very important
that you find your own words

to describe your own feelings
and your own experiences.

So are you saying
you're no longer as happy

as you once were
about your experience?

No.

It's just that sometimes,

it feels as though someone...

Yes, Frank?

Tell 'em!

Someone's tryin' to...

Someone wants to...

Kill you!

Yes!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Like there's something
really bad out there.

Like evil forces
all... all around you.

It's in the air you breathe.

Everywhere.

Oh.
And it's only getting worse.

Yeah! Yeah!

And voices,
like giant mosquito noises.

Yeah, mosquito noises.

E-except they're
all distorted like...

Like that! Yeah! Yeah!

I don't hear buzzing.
I don't scratch my gut!

I don't believe in orky.
I'm not a nut.

All right. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen! Everybody!

Hey, guys!

Guys! Guys?

Â¶

Oh, my!

Keep an eye on them.

If they get any closer
to the site,

we'll have to move to plan b.

Damn monster huggers.

Dump her in the usual spot,
boys,

and keep a low profile.

Ok, boss.

Â¶

China?

Oh!

Hey! Hey, wait!

Hey!

Hey.

Find anything yet?

I don't understand it.

There must be a tunnel
down here or somethin'.

Ya think?

Mmm-hmm.

I always figured
diggin's kinda like swingin'.

If you swing high enough,
you get some place magical.

Like breaking
the sound barrier.

Only harder.

Sure would like
to break through, though.

Dad, we should go inside.

It's gonna rain.

Wait, we gotta try somethin'.

It'll be great.

Ah! That one over there.

That is Columbus discoverus
formation.

"Columbus discoverus"?
There's no such thing.

Oh, yeah? Look carefully.

See it?

You have to look really,
really close to see it.

Forget everything you think
you know and really look.

Right there.

I think I see the <i> Santa Maria.</i>

Yeah, and I see the pinto.

<i>Pinta!</i> Come on. Help me.

What the hell?

This is weird!

Over there! Right there. Guess.

Oh, my God!

I see a bunny.

The energizer.

Or is it a bird? A bald eagle.

Whoa! I see smoke signals.

This is incredible, dad.

Me and my grandpa used to do this
all the time when I was a kid.

He told me

that the sky is the one thing
that witnesses all of history

and records it.

It's full of
really incredible things.

You just gotta look for 'em.

Do it again, dad.

Yeah, do more.

Yeah?

Ok.

Ready?

Behold.

The 4th of July!

Hey, Uncle kipper.

Sorry I'm late. Here's the
new supply of sedatives.

Dad, that was awesome.

It was.

Noogie, noogie, noogie!

Timber!

Oh, hi.

Wanda,

I'm sorry about yesterday.

Last night I read
your latest work:

"Male drum beating without
the touchy-feely stuff."

Really sensitive. Do you always
make fun of your patients?

Stop whining!

Wanda,

I really like you.

I mean like a lot.

First time I met you, I couldn't
believe how beautiful you were.

Ahem.

And funny.

Dad.

No, she's really funny.

Oh, great, Jack,
you're bleeding.

You better come in
and get that redressed.

And I'd like to do some tests.

Tests?

Now, tell me what you see.

Jack, could you
please try to concentrate?

Ahem.

Children.

Playing.

Thousands of 'em.

But one's missing.

That's what you see?

Did you draw this?

Because it's really good.

Jack, have you noticed anything
unusual since your accident?

Like difficulty concentrating?

Have you been experiencing intense
feelings of joy and fear?

Jack, let me see your stomach.

The rash!

Jack, h-have you
seen the monster?

What? Monster? No.

No. That was a dream.

Um, from my accident.

This is incredible!
I don't believe it!

Somehow you have taken on the
psychoses of my other patients.

That was just a dream.

Wasn't it?

I'm gonna have to keep
you here for observation.

Do want me to shut
the window tonight?

It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

I can't reach mom.

What are those for?

They're for him.

I think he might
be able to help.

Ashley, would you knock
it off with that stuff?

It's not funny. But...

don't talk to dad about it, you'll
get him locked up for good!

They'll throw him
in some loony bin,

and we're never
gonna see him again.

But Josh, there is a monster.
He ate my cookies.

Damn it, Ashley.
Just get off it. Will you?

This is not a game anymore.

Grow up.

Hey, Josh.

Ok, but I wanna see you
swallow those pills.

Why'd he write
dad's name on his house?

I don't know.

Can you help our dad?

This guy's gone wacko.

"Omni sweet"?

Probably on some
artificial sugar high.

I think he wants some more.

He saw some in our cabin.

Why don't you kids
go and play now?

Hello? Oh, yes, doctor.

Yes, everything's fine.

Ok. Bye-bye.

Come on, now. Down the hatch
like a good boy.

I will explain everything
when we get there.

Come, we must hurry!

What does this have
to do with our dad?

Everything.

It's here somewhere.

I know it's here.

Faster. We must go faster.

We?

Where are we?

Give me a hand.

It's here. I know it's here.

Oh, oh.

Ah. Here it is.

Not so long ago,
man could become animal

and animal could become man.

Back and forth,
whenever they wanted.

Animals could shed their skins.

And humans could
become anything.

A wolf, a fish, a bird.

Did you ever have dreams
about flying?

Yeah.

We all have those.

It's part of our secret
memory of those times.

What does this have to do
with our dad?

There's more.

Orky!

They're killin' him

by putting toxins in the lake.

That's what he's been
tryin' to tell us.

Your father and the others.

It's the only way he knows how.

His breath. His breath was bad.

I knew he was sick!

Wait. Are you tryin' to tell me

that my dad's some sort
of messenger or something?

Uh-huh. He's sick
'cause orky's sick.

I'm glad you believed him.

That's why he came to you.

As you grow,

trust your heart
as much as your mind.

It's the best part of you.

Now go tell your dad.

He has to know.

I'll be fine.

Well?

We got trouble, boss.

Japs came within 50 yards
of the dump site.

I think it's time
to move to plan b.

Dad! Dad, you're not crazy.

You're a messenger for orky.

You're just trying
to tell us that he's sick.

Dad, is that what
you're tryin' to tell us?

There is no monster.

There is no monster.

It was only a dream.

Those pills.

Shh. Quiet.

There he is again. Hey!

He's that little dude
from China. I told you.

I think he's tryin'
to tell us something.

Hey!

That's him!

I told you. Come on.

This way.

Don't lose him.
Come on, let's go!

Through here.

This will be worth millions.
I finally get my own wheels.

What's he doing?

Hurry up. Come on!

What do you think, boss?

It's got a few leaks,
but it'll do.

It's a fake.

The whole thing is a fake.

This is going to be so good.

But he ate my cookies.

Fill 'er up
and you're off, boys.

It's a perfect night.

Come on, guys.

There's somethin'
goin' on here.

We're gonna find out
what it is.

Oof. Must cost big bucks to
dispose of this stuff, huh?

I mean, not many places take
hazardous waste these days.

Phew.

I know that smell. Shh.

Phew.

Just land her on shore, right
in the middle of town.

Yeah. And confess.

Tell the world it's been
a hoax all these years.

An attempt to create
a tourist industry.

No more ridiculous
foreigners bothering us

with their effeminate
little submarines.

No more whining natives
claiming

that we're endangering
an endangered species.

We're left alone
to go about our business.

Everybody's happy.

Especially me.

An inspired, creative,

cerebral plan, don't you think?

I hate violence.

Josh, we can't let him do this.

You stay here
and keep a lookout.

I'm gonna see if I can
sabotage that thing.

Uh, uh, one more question.

Where's the men's room?

Thank you.

Come on.

Josh, they heard us.
We gotta get outta here.

Josh!

I can drive this.

We can use it as evidence.

Bon voyage.

And remember,
you never heard of me.

Go on, get back there.
Come on, come on. Go, go, go.

Â¶ Bring down the lights Â¶

Â¶ sing me a song Â¶

Â¶ let's make believe Â¶

Â¶ we can't go wrong Â¶

Â¶ we're makin' magic, yeah Â¶

Â¶ all night long Â¶

Josh, what are we gonna do?

Wait 'til he gets out,
we'll go to the police. Shh.

Inspiration. Inspiration.

<i>Â¶</i>

God, I'm good.

Ok. And

bingo.

I'm outta here.

Where'd he go?

Whoa.

What's happening?
I dunno. Something's wrong

big trouble. Ok.

Big trouble.

What's he doing? What the...

Josh!

Stop. Stop. Stop.

Stop. Turn! I'm tryin'!

No, no, Josh!
No, turn. No! Turn!

Find the brake! Ah, found it!

We hit it!

That colossal idiot!

Josh.

We gotta get outta here.
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

Josh, open it.

It's stuck.

That's the dump site.

No. Not there!

Anywhere but there!

There's gotta be a pump switch
in here somewhere.

I found it! Found it.
Josh, it's sinking fast.

Help!

Help, please help!

They're probably
looking for us right now.

It's been a long time.

They probably don't even know
we're missing.

Besides,

good luck finding us.

Wait. Did you guys hear that?

That was me.

What are you doing?

I'm calling orky.
He'll hear us that way.

Ash, this is orky.

It's a fake.

Get a grip.

Jack?

Jack?

Oh, Jack, what are you doing?

Trying to find my kids.

Where are they today, Jack?

Jack, are you ok?

Jack, it's gonna be all right.
Come on up.

One step at a time.

Uh-oh. Whoa! Whoa!

Oh!

And I saw a...
Big, big, huge...

That little idiot. Look at him.

He's confessing.

Well, isn't that what
he was supposed to do?

It wasn't supposed to sink,
you moron.

Now they're gonna
go looking for it.

Take the explosives
and rig the dump site.

I hope dad'll be all right.

Yeah. Me too.

What was that?

Orky?

Hey! We're rescued!

I can't believe it. They
actually found us. Yes! Yes.

Josh.

What? What is it?

Oh, shit.

It's those one-armed dudes.

Damn it!

Whoa.

Wow.

Wow.

We're moving.

Well, well, well.

What have you boys been up to?

Hey! There's
something down there!

Yeah, there's somethin'
down there!

Yeah! Something big!

We was just followin' orders.

Hey! Miller's gonna kill you.

Uh, mack Miller?

What do you say
we take a little ride, boys?

Come on, orky. Hurry!

He'd better, or we're history.

Where are we?

Dad?

Daddy!

Hey, guys.

Come on. Are you all right?

How did you get here?

Gravity?

What is this place?

I love you guys so much.

Ah, whoo.

Who are you?

That's Hiro. He's from China.

Hey, how you doin', Hiro?

I have been here before.
This place was in my dream.

This place is real!

This is it.

Dad! This is where he lives.

Orky.

Wow.

Hi. It's me.

It's all right.

You like your nose tickled?

I guess so.

Hey, boy.

You saved our lives.

How you doin'?

I love you, orky.

Dad, he's bleeding.

Dad, look at his back.

Oh, God.

It could be the toxins, dad.

What's happening, daddy?

I think he'd dying, honey.

No!

Hey! Hey! Come on!

Come on. No.

Please. No!

Come on.

Daddy, no. Daddy.

Orky. Come on.

Orky, no. No.

Give him space, honey.
No, daddy. Please.

Please. No, no.

Orky, I won't let you die.
Please don't die.

No. No. Please, no.

I'm sorry, honey.

It's all right.

Come here.

He's been sick for a long time.

He's out of pain.

Wow, look at that.
Is that a sand castle?

Bit more, bit more.
All right, comin' down.

All right, that's good.
That's good. Keep going.

Buddy, move it!
Get away from the hole.

We gotta keep this hole clear.

Don't let them find him, ok?

Are you ok, honey?

Are you all right?

Jack?

Mr. Black? Did you see
anything down there?

No. I didn't see anything.

Can you tell us
what it was like?

There's nothin' down there.

Rope up and get a shot anyway.

We need it for the story.

Dad, no.

Hey, did you hear what I said?

Hey, are you listening to me?
There is nothing down there.

I mean it.

Sheriff? It's not safe.

Don't be silly. He'll be fine.

It's not safe!

Please. Don't...

Dad?

No.

Â¶ Ay-yah-ho Â¶

Â¶ ay-yah-ho Â¶

Â¶ ay-yah ay-yah-ho Â¶

Â¶ ay-yah ay-yah-ho Â¶

<i>Â¶ ay-yah-ho Â¶</i>

We're gonna need some...

Â¶ Ay-yah ay-yah-ho Â¶

Â¶ Ay-oh-way, oh-yah Â¶

Â¶ ah-way, oh-way-yah Â¶

Â¶ ah-way Â¶

<i>Â¶ Ay-yah Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ ay-yah, ay-yah Â¶</i>

I told you everything
I know, Wanda.

Just as it happened. No one
else knows except the group.

Jack, it's not that
I don't believe you.

It's just that
it makes no rational sense.

Wait.

For what it's worth,

I am finding the irrational

pretty damn exciting
these days.

God.

There's nothing I'd like more than
to see things the way you do.

Want to come in for a swim?

I know you miss him, ash.
I do too.

I wonder what he's doin'
right now.

Nothing. He's gone.

He's only gone
if you let him be.

Remember that story I told
you about Curtis and Jackie?

Yup.

Well, I remember
the ending now.

Jackie grew up.

And he had a child of his own.

A beautiful little girl.

And that little girl
was so full of wonder

and appreciation and knowledge

and all the things that
her father had left behind.

Is this one
of those metaphors, dad?

When did you get so smart?

So what happened
with the little girl?

How's it end?

I guess that's up
to the little girl.

Ah.

<i>Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Do you believe in magic Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ in a young girl's heart Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ how the music can free her</i>

<i>Â¶ I'll tell you 'bout the magic
that can free your soul Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ but it's like tryin' to tell a
stranger 'bout rock and roll Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ if you believe in magic,</i>
