Come on, Eleni.

Come, Niki.
Eleni... How's Eleni?

Eleni?

Eleni?

Eleni?

Ah, Eleni...

It's me!

My sister!

My little girl.

What did this man
do to you?

Hey children!

Come on, let's go to the tree.

Here?

Up here? On this
branch here?

Pretty.

Isn't it pretty?

Allah opened the skies today.

Yes he did.

-Have you got anything for me?
Yes.

Key.
Thanks.

Two messages.

And... a package.

All for you, mr. Harris.

A present?

I hope so, Gilmes.
Thank you.

Dear Norman, your photographs of the
war between the Greeks and the Turks

in Asia Minor are interesting

although too artistic for a
daily newspaper.

Unfortunately, we have already
hired another one of your colleagues.

How could he slip out
of our hands!

To lose such a tailor!

Chicago!

I couldn't stand it, Uncle.

God gave our family daughters.

Like locusts.

No grooms, no portions!

If it wasn't for the war...

My dearies will remain single.
Seven.

Seven marriage cousins.

So let's send to that Prothromos
another one.

This time, from my family.

My Alexandra is ready to travel
to the world's end..

Alexandra, say so yourself.

And she's 27...

29.
Shh!

Brother...

...I have four unmarried girls and
I'm a widow.

I want another chance.

Nikis' godmother knows I
need another chance.

Niki.

Your turn.

<i>Prothromos is a very
honest man.</i>

Prothromos is very honest.

Now you know good English,
I'll teach you some more.

Then why did you call us? You had
already decided.

It's unfair.

And God watches!

Haro!

Haro!

Haro!

My daughter. Haro?

Haro!

Antonis...

Antonis.

My long-haired Haro.

The Doctor said that on Monday
we'll break the plaster.

I'm positive.

I want to return to Samothrace strong.

Haro...

...you haven't told me
the colour of your eyes yet.

Brown maybe?

What would I do all these months
without your letters?

I kiss you.

Soldier Antonis Memas.

God's servant Hareklia (Haro)
takes

...God's servant Constantinos.

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

Have a nice trip to America.

Forgive me.

I wanted to admire you
as a bride.

Grandpa...

Natalia Petrova.

Daria lvanova.

Maria Nuamova

Did you go to the doctor
I told you about?

Olga, my little.

With this you have paid
for your ticket.

OK. We'd like to look at the
young man.

OK. Sit down, sit down.

OK. Genadi Louisin.

30 years old. Railroad worker at the
west coast of America.

Look at those eyes.

Handsome son of a bitch.

We wrote to each other

on the 2nd of May, 1922, which is
of course today, in other words

at 10 o'clock precisely, which is

...midnight American time...

...a priest will place a ring on
the finger of the lucky fiancé.

OK please, please, everybody, please,
let's have quiet.

Thank you very much.

Step over here.

Yeah.

I announce the engagement of
the servant of God, Olga

to the servant of God, Genadi.

Please.

So, you're now engaged.

Feel good?

When I arrived, there was
a blizzard.

That's right.

The snow was 1 metre high.

I cried for 15 days.

I couldn't handle Chicago.

And you think I will?

I swear to Dad's bones, Niki.

Prothromos is a soft man.

It's the second woman he takes
from the same house.

He agreed immediately.

Even I found it strange.

Do you love here, on
the island?

Did I ever sew a new dress
to go on a date?

Did I ever put jasmine
on my chest?

Did I ever expect the postman?

Love...

Love is for the loiterers, Eleni.

But I miss it.

If it was a stranger...

Someone who would wait for me.

I migrate in order to get married with
the same wedding dress...

Holding the same picture as
you did last year.

Are you sure?

If you've got the cash, yes.

Sold to Boston World, then.

From Smyrna Gazette to the Boston
World.

And you just take my
first pay check.

Get out of here.

Good luck, kid.

And watch your ass in battle.

Have a good trip, big guy.

It's been a while since you read my
palm, Emine. What does it say now?

A wave will erase all your
past life.

It already has.

I'm going to start over again.

How?

Who knows?

Selling automobiles, maybe.

Or shoes.

And no more pictures?

I'm going home.

At least maybe I can
save my marriage.

Hey!

Hey! The glasses!

Who did you ask?
I'll pay you.

You got them from the table..
We didn't steal them, we'll pay..

Look at a man...

Calm down, forget him.

We'll find elsewhere.

Who are all these women?

They are the mail order brides.

Wares, rape, orphan hood
earthquakes, poverty,...

...that's what's driving
these women away..

To where?
 To America.

Which is full of unmarried
immigrants.

Dear God...

don't let the sea get angry.

Make America beautiful.

Make it look like Russia.

Are you from Samothrace?

Anyone from Samothrace?

No, Russian.

Anyone from Samothrace?
I don't know.

Any girl from Samothrace?

Yianenna here.

My sugarplum, "zaharenio mou".

Anyone from Samothrace?

Over here!

Come!

Sit.

Sit with us.

What's that?

My grandpa's oud.

He taught me how to play.

Are you dressmakers?
I am.

Kalmia and garlic.

The broom asked for
his favourite food.

He says that the American
garlic doesn't smell.

Prothomos.

Chicago'da terzi dükkaný var.

He'll sew clothes for men
and I for women.

He asked for any woman, as long
as she doesn't nag.

What could I do?

Four women count on me.

And four men count on me.

I'm Niki.

All these six are from
the island.

Angeliki, Lemonia...

Katerina.
Margarita.

Antigone.
Maria.

Samothrace is out to
conquer Chicago!

I'm Haro. I'm from Thrace.

In Thrace I made sweets. But
the earthquake toppled the shop.

I'm going to Canada to marry
a pastry-cook.

Ohh! Is he from Samothrace?

Is the pastry-cook
from Samothrace?

No, no.
Not him.

Making friends is wonderful.
Making money's fine.

Hey girls!

Let's have a dance.

A dance?

Cheers!

It's a nice party, eh?

You know each other.
Maria.

Mister Harris...

...our friend Emine told me that
you are an excellent war photographer.

I'd like to ask you a favour.

Take my portrait..

For the newspaper of my island.

Mykonos.

Fat Yiorgos, the ship's photographer,
did not do a good job.

Both times I came out with
my eyes closed.

I'm sorry, but my photography
days are over.

So...A war is the only
thing that

inspires you?

Exclusively manly things?

A war doesn't inspire me.

What...

What about these?

Sweet, huh?

I was never so lucky mister...
Karabulat.

Ka- ra- bu- lat.

From the beautiful land of Georgia.

You should photograph it some time.

I run immigration agency. I have
seventy passengers on board.

Congratulations. I thought you
imported spicy photographs.

What's wrong with spicy
photographs?

Those eastern women...

...ethereal bodies...

...they make you sigh.

Yeah.

This is not pornography.

It is art.
Well, sure. Fine. I understand..

Well, if you wish to see them
I'm in the cabin 57.

OK, thank you. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too. Thank you.

Good evening.

Good evening.

Where are the other girls?
(Pou einai...)

They left.

Your English is good..
Thank you.

My godmother taught me English
and sewing.

I'm a seamstress.

What's your name?

Mine is Norman.

My name's Niki...

Douka.

Well then mine's Norman Harris.

What papers were you...tearing?

You were tearing photographs!

I was a photographer.

You are not anymore?

Right now I'm nothing
but a passenger.

Like me.

Or less.

I'm neither a seamstress
nor a bride.

If... you have more photographs

...don't tear them.

Just give them to me.

What will you do with them?

Even photographs of strangers are...

very good for decoration.

Your house must have a lot
of photographs.

Only one.

Your parents' wedding?
No.

My father in his coffin.

I'm sorry.
Yes.

My father in his coffin and...

...all the family around him.

This is the way in my island.

Many people have their...

...only photograph when they're dead.

So what photograph did you
send to America?

I did not.

The girls from my island

we sent birth papers so the
husbands know our age.

Here.

Haro's veil.

So you mend wedding gowns as well.

700 down there.

Most of them are second, third hand.

Good night.

Where are you from?

I'm from a place I will
never see again.

And one, and two! Let's go!

Evelyn, bacaklarýný serbest býrak!

Oh Carol, you put on some
weight, darling! Take a break!

Oh, captain!

The "9 Muses" is their big hit.

They may be a bit rusty after the tour
of the antiquities but

three or four more rehearsals
and they'll fly again.

Sure Marion, sure.

Once they've seen the Acropolis,
Troy...

...and the Delphi up close they'll soar.

These women are bored
with their marriages.

They wouldn't know how to
put a roast in the oven.

By the way Marion, there is a sewing machine
and a tailor in first class

Who can replace your stolen costumes.
Oh! Does he embroider?

That's asking for a lot.

There is a seamstress
in third class.

Niki Douka.

Great. Nikola!

Go find Niki Douka.

Tell her that there's a good job
for her in first class.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

Come on girls! Lt's stick
those chests out.

The moustache doesn't suit him.

Tell me more about Antonis.

Well... He joined the army.

About 5 years ago.

I remember his hair...

Black.

Is it only his hair
that you remember?

His house was far away.
2 hours by foot.

Near St. Elias church.

2 hours by foot.

How did it look like?

Blue windows.

Small.

Just that?

A jasmine...

...big like a forest.

Come on, remember more.

He chanted at the church.

The vicar choral said he would
send him to study Byzantine music.

Is that so?

Imagine...

If it's written on 27th
January 1922,

it's the sixth letter.

We'd better keep them in order.

27th of January, 1922.

Dear Haro, our life will change
in Samothrace.

You will really like it there.

The Aegean Sea shines in blue
from our vineyard.

Once again, you don't mention
the colour of your eyes.

You always forget to.

I kiss you,

Antonis Memas.

Beautifully written.

Who'd expect it from Antonis?

A real love letter.

I'm going to be like a sculpture
at the ruins of Ephesus.

I'm sorry darling, we have
a rehearsal.

OK! Let's begin!

Well done, ladies!

Make the tunics as short
as possible.

No one's interested in their art.

Come outside, hurry up!

I'll see you this evening.

You're very good at your work.

Every person has a gift.

What kind of photographs
did you make?

Unusual ones.

Who paid?

Nobody.

Then why?

I like to take photographs of
things that others pass over.

Details.

The minor things.

Minor things.

Did you photograph Americans?
I sold to Americans..

It was still the fashion then to
mail postcards of landscapes.

Do you understand?

A little.

Can you still make
a photograph?

Who'd be interested?

The brides from my island.

Not you?
(Esy ohi?)

Ohi.
(No.)

I don't have my camera anymore,
anyway.

What, you lost it?

I sold it.

By the time you go to Canada,
it won't be visible.

When I declined to migrate

...my father beat me up.

I packed and tried to
go to The City (Istanbul).

My little brother gave me his pocket
money to buy Antonis cherries and cigars.

But my father found out.

He chased me in the corn fields...

And caught me.

He beat me up.

Even though he loves me very much.

Then why?

He was desperate.

If I don't get the boys to America,
they'll be drafted in the army.

12 and 16 years old.

I brought them up.

And suddenly, Canada.

What do we know about them, Niki?

Only their job and address.

How are we going to
sleep with a stranger?

Only rice, Heracles.

I can't stand anything else.

Heracles takes care of me.

This is the only place where I
enjoy a bite to eat.

Captain...

If your proposition still holds
and you can lend me a camera...

...I'll take your portrait after dinner.

What changed your mind?

A face like yours is
hard to resist.

<i>Is that so?</i>
And who will you take after, then?

Handsome Heracles or
skinny Yiorgos?

Actually, I was thinking of taking
the portraits of the ladies in third class.

With their wedding veils on as well.

But there are 700 of them.

700 pairs of eyes!

Mister Harris...

Five of my first cousins

and four of my nieces
were mail-order brides.

You'd better show those women...
respect.

It's like snow in the summer.

Good morning.
(in Turkish)

Good morning...
in English.

My name is Norman Harris and...

...I just want to thank you for
allowing me this favour of

taking your photographs.

It's incredible...the way you
all look it's...

very beautiful.

You're all dressed but it's
gonna take sometime.

Nicolas is my assistant
over there

and he'll help me photograph your
beautiful head dresses.

It's great, I love these flowers
as well. It's great.

I know some of you are from
different countries

and I'll try and take
the photograph with...

Good luck ,sir.

Thank you.
I need your good wishes.

If Nicolas gets bored of me I
might need your English as well.

You're wearing black?

I don't need a photograph.

Niki...

please stay for the
first photograph.

For luck.

Nicolas! Let's do this.

Let's get going.

You'd like to be the first?
Here we go.

Everybody, sit down.

OK, go.

Like this.

I want you to look down here, the lens.
Aikaterini. 23 years old.

Aikaterini. Very beautiful name.
There you go.

OK. A beautiful picture.

Smile.

Yeah. Good.

Angeliki. 19 years old.

Are you finished?
Yes.

You like it?
Very nice.

I'll see you later.
OK.

Hey Yiorgos.
Oh, hello..

May I peak at the blushing brides?

No charge of that.

But I'm willing to
pay, Yiorgos.

For some negatives.

You can tell the American they
were mislaid.

Sorry, but I can't help you.

Sorry, but the American keeps
them in his cabin.

Hey! Excuse me.

Yelena Missin. Russian.
Give me her photograph, please.

I am her best man and guardian, and
her future husband is very correct.

I haven't photographed her bottom,
mr Karabulat. She has nothing to fear.

I won't even allow you to photograph her
face or even half her face or even her profile

so please give me the photographs.

As soon as I develop them.
You have...

You have developed them.

But she herself did not refuse.
She herself has been taught never to say no.

I'll ask her.

It is not for her to say, I mean
that is how the agency works.

Well this is not how I work.

Well... Let us not lose any heart over
this. There is somebody on board
who will deal with it for me.

Ten years younger.

Show them to fat Yiorgos.

Tell him to pack.

I will, my Captain.

The Russians, leave them out,
friend Norman.

Has their guardian forbid it?

I forbid it.

Can you tell me why?

Money.

What money?

Mr. Karabulat is very particular.

But he is a regular customer of the
Argonautical steaming company

Eleven years now without fail.

The remaining women are enough.

And more than enough at that.

What do you put inside?

Good morning.

Good morning.

I bought this one when I
was planning a trip to Greece.

It's an English Greek phrase book.

Read it the other way around.
I'd like you to have it.

The sun's making
your eyes shine.

What did he say?

He said that he's hungry.

It's about time.

Antigone, come on.

You speak English well.

Haro, wait for me.

Thank you.

From my island.

Black olives.

Samothrace?

(In Greek)
<i>Samothraki.</i>

What is your village?

Detroit.

But my father was born in Ireland.

So you're not American-American.

Your mother was mail-order
bride too?

No.

No.

My father, he saw her scaling halibut.

It's a fish. She was scaling a fish one day
in the market place...

And he saw her and he fell in love
with her curly red hair.

I became a photographer because I
couldn't stand the smell of fish.

I wish I could show you some of
the places I've been.

Minor things.

I think I know that song.

Up to the age of 16 I sang
and danced a lot.

After that... finished.

You know... I've seen more
than 50.000 palms in my life.

Adulterous' hands are dry.
Ministers' are cold.

The hands of diplomats are like...
Like linen.

Let me see your palm!

I want to read your future.

<i>Kýsmetini.</i>

For free.

No need.

I know mine.

So, what are you going to do my friend,
about Yelena, the Russian woman?

I'm not in the mood right now.

Send her as a gift to the
Turkish Engineer.

Oh, don't go celibate now my friend,
Captain Marinos.

Thank God, I have found first
class quality again.

You know, in 1917 I had the
bunch of 11 women with big tits.

In 1919 they all had blue eyes
and little beauty spots.

1920, voluptuous asses.

Now I have... virgins.

With guarantee.

Olga Kratingova. 16 years old.

Resident of Taganrok. Found to be
anatomically a virgin.

April 1922.

A little... cunt of gold.

I've seventy women, they will pick up
a shovel and take the whole of Oklahoma.

But I have six who are destined
for special employment.

Anyway, go easy on
the photographer.

Don't provoke him.

Here Nicolas, take these.

Take them to the lab.
Niki.

Don’t forget to do the
Captain's jacket.

There's no film in the camera.

I just wanna see your face.

I'm going to rip off all my buttons just so
I can watch you sew them
back again with your hands.

Then you'll pay double.

Niki Douka. Tell me
something about yourself.

There is nothing special,
mr. Norman Harris.

Don’t you have dreams?

Yes.

A Singer machine.

Nothing else?

Fabric.
And?

And...
A lot of customers.

Is that all?

Yes, that is all.

I don't believe a word.

They all say: "Niki do this, Niki do
that, Niki come, Niki go".

"Niki, you are the father of the family".
Are you?

Yes, I am.

People like you make us
appreciate life.

No.

Not me.

My father.

Like father, like daughter.

My father was a very
funny man.

Mine, he was very vivid.

Like a hurricane.

Like father, like son.

You made a joke.

Page 27. English proverb.
Not a joke.

In Greece, mostly men
make jokes.

You are onboard now.
You're not in Greece.

So you can say any
joke you want.

Yelena from Odessa.

Why you put me
here in the dark?

You'll see.

I see nothing.

<i>Siga-siga.</i>
Don't be in a hurry.

I am in a hurry.

They're gonna look for me.

Just give me a minute.

I don't have a minute.

I want to go.

Look.

See its magic?

In America, the rich paint their servants
black to distinguish them.

Will they paint us as well?
Don't be stupid!

We'll be ladies with ring, hat and
a purse of our own.

Our own purse?
Sure.

Miss Kardaki...

...I wanted to ask you.

Do you believe that we marry
the appropriate ones?

There aren't appropriate or not.
The workers don't think about things like that.

My father used to choose
the grooms.

He was too choosy.

So the time passed.

Now I give in marriage others.

This is my tenth transatlantic voyage.

Always for the same sacred reason.

I have experience.

Especially for the immigrants,
love is big trouble.

Close your eyes...

and dream...

a huge country.

Do you know how many men wear old shirts?
How many need a new one?

Millions!

Well, my girl...

sit tight and get weaving!

In 10 years' time your tailor shop
will be huge!

In the East...

...the men steal the one they love
on a night with no moon

and run far away on a white horse.

<i>Beyaz atýn üstünde.</i>

Say that again.

I said, in the East...
