O 'Rourke, Dylan. Age, 28.

Cause of death?

High speed car crash.

Very romantic,
very sensational.

Very James Dean.

Here how I keep track
of time, Dylan.

Every October
16th, I find you here.

Ten years
of clockwork.

What do you want
with me, detective?

I'm just looking
out for you.

It still doesn't
make sense.

Her ring was missing.

She never took that ring off.
The-the cabby--

There's a lot of illegal
cabs out there, Dylan.

We've gone
over all this.

It was an accident.

It was no accident.

I need to find out
what really happened.

Go home.

Denial's the first stage.

Elvis. Take that guy.

Some people actually
believe he still exists.

Yeah, denial.
Christ, I can't believe Elvis is dead.

Then depression.
Shit, Elvis is dead.

What am I gonna do?
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

And then anger.

Why?

Why did he have to die?

And finally, acceptance.

All right. It makes sense.
It's all God's will.

The king is dead.
Rest his soul.

Do you know what
I'm saying, Mr. Stark?

You know, your
family and friends

probably just can't accept
the fact that you're dead.

I wouldn't worry about it.

Frank Sinatra was a no show
at Dean Martin's funeral.

Can't get much closer
than the Rat Pack.

I think it's time
to call it, lad.

Just five more minutes.

For Jesus sake, Dylan,
no visitors are comin'.

Bastards are probably already
out spending his money.

Tomorrow'll be a
big turnout though.

Young kid's
about your age.

Actually, he's
a year younger.

You knew him?

He was the quarterback on my
high school football team.

We hooked up for 27
touchdowns one senior year.

So you'll see all
your old friends tomorrow.

I-I haven't seen any of
them in a long time.

All the more reason
to catch up.

You ever
fantasize about,

you know, watching
your own funeral?

Of course.
Doesn't everybody?

My father always said you can only
really tell a man's character

by who shows up
at his funeral.

That's a little late
by that point.

One of life's
great fucking ironies.

But Dylan, if you've got to wait 'til your
funeral to find out what makes you tick,

my heart aches for you.

Rest in peace.

Would you like
some tea, Dylan?

Tea? For Jesus, Liz!
He'll have a shot of whiskey.

No. I-I don't drink.

Better you than me.

Liz, I'm going to decorate
the inside of me glass.

You give the fucking insomniac
a tall tumbler of warm milk.

Is your family
in the city?

I don't talk
to them anymore.

Uh. Liz, he never puts
that bloody thing down.

It's a sentimental thing.

The yo-yo almost always
comes back to you.

Reminds me of
the mistakes I've made.

Mistakes. We all
make mistakes.

There's a difference
in mistakes and regrets.

Oh.

Decko gave me that.

The hands are for friendship,
the heart is for love,

and the crown
is for loyalty.

Someone close to me
had the same ring.

And if the heart is pointed inward,
it means your heart is taken.

Shite. They'd better
go get me Viagra.

I like him. Don't get
me wrong. It's just that--

This genetic Viagra
is full of shite.

I can't quite
figure him out.

Oh, Liz. He's just a lad, that's
all, who needs some guidance.

Don't feel sorry for him-

There are people who float through
life wantin' to be alone.

It doesn't bother them that they
don't affect anything or anyone.

Dylan probably
feels sorry for us.

He doesn't have
to be like others.

And, uh, so you
guys've been together for a while,

but you guys didn't really like
each other when you first met.

That's true. Yeah.

Freshman year,
we met.

It kinda, we didn't
hang out as much,

and, you know, that
kinda changed probably--

Different friends and then--

And then we--remember
that party we went to?

Yeah. That's when we probably
started hanging out there.

Yeah, and then we made out that night.

So, what do you guys have
planned after graduation?

We're going to
college together.

Uh, so, keeping
it alive, huh?

Yeah, forever.
Forever.

Shit!

Forever.

Someone close to me
had the same ring.

Dylan.

Dylan-

Please, open up.

I know you're in there.

Dylan, open the door.

Lei' me in.

I wanna help
you through this.

I'm missing you-

Dylan! Dylan, open please.

Please.

What, are you nervous?

We'll take care of him.

Go on. It's all right.

Ew. Does he work here?

I thought he'd be a big shot lawyer
or something by now. How pathetic.

Is that who I think he is?
You gotta be kidding me.

I haven't seen him
in years, man.

I thought
he was dead.

Didn't he use
to date Natalie Penner?

Natalie Penner. That's what fucked him up.
Fucking chick, man.

His best friend, Steve.

Yeah. Don't you remember?
Dylan and Natalie were together and then Steve,

than fucking rat snake.
Yeah, he just sharked her.

And the yo-yo returns.

So, did you see some
of your old pals?

Some of them.

Did you talk
to any of them?

No.

Listen to me, son.

Here's your opportunity
to rebuild some relationships.

Some of those relationships
I'd just rather bury.

Hi!

Hi.

Are you two married?

No. Not yet.

So, when are
you getting married?

In May.

Congrats. May what?

May, the day never come.

I'm just trying
to get my career going.

I just don't really have much time
for all that wedding type shit.

Now, don't get me wrong. She's a great girl.
They just think what I'm thinking.

So, where are you working?

Wright and Price law firm. Trying to get partnership.
There's some thick coin.

I, uh, couldn't believe when I
heard about Shawn. It was just--

I don't know. It feels
like yesterday he was--

When he was throwing
touchdowns to Dylan?

Speaking of Dylan, does anyone
know what he's been up to lately?

Dylan!

Steve. How are you?

Real good, man.
Christ, it's, uh, been a long time.

Shit!

Oh.

Excuse me. You wouldn't happen
to have an extra one, would you?

You look like
you've seen a ghost.

Have two.

Thank you.

You--y-you work here?

Yeah, I do. And you?

I've made partner at Axler, Wright
and Price law firm. Thick coin.

So, who's the ghost?

Old boyfriend.

Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

How long has it been since
you've seen that poltergeist?

Ten years ago.

You make that
sound like eternity.

Yeah, a lot's
happened since then.

A lot of waiting?

A lot of waiting.

He's special.

He was special.

So, uh, this--

This, uh, you know,
job get you laid?

What's that?

Excuse me. Dylan, there's a flower delivery out back.
I could use your help.

See you, Steve.

Catch you later,
Dylan.

Natalie.

Hi.

When did you
start smoking?

Oh, ten years ago,
but it seems like--

Like yesterday.

Yeah.

You know this is the seventh
death from our class?

You'd think we'd run into
these people at weddings,

but instead you get, "You're
cordially invited to a funeral."

Are you still in med school?
Did you finish?

No, I didn't start.
I'm a nurse.

Nurse?

You've probably seen some of my patients.
I'm really not that good yet.

You remember the finger I sprained
during the Carson Heights game

and you, um,
taped the wrong one?

I can't lift anything
with this now.

I'm so sorry.

No. I'm-I'm kidding.

Oh!

I should go back
inside, you know.

Steve can't
stand smokers.

Natalie.

Ten years have, uh,
really done you justice.

Thanks.

Done you justice?

I'll always be grateful if you got
a lot to clean up after the party.

Good indication
you've got friends.

No wonder my place is
so clean all the time.

I bet if it was you in that box
today, you'd have the same turnout.

You have to be somebody.

I've been gone too long,
and people forget.

You'd be surprised what
death brings out in people.

No, it'd be
another Mr. Stark.

No, bollocks. It'd be bigger
than Jack Kennedy's funeral.

Let's have my
funeral then.

All the Guinness you can drink
says nobody shows up at my wake.

You serious?

Yeah. We'll-we'll put my name in
the obituaries. Easy as that.

It reminds me of
the good old days.

You, you faked a funeral?

April Fool's day, 1975.

Me and me Da got my brother to
believe I was run over by a tractor.

He comes into the church.
I popped out of the coffin.

Scared the living
shite out of him.

What did he do?

He beat the shite
out of me.

Didn't talk
to me for six years.

Whatever happened at throwing eggs at
houses and burning bags and dog crap?

The Irish don't mess around
when it comes to pranks.

O'Rourke, Dylan Age 28

He was a graduate
of Pennington High School

and member of the City
Championship football team.

Cause of death?

High speed car crash.

Very romantic.
Very sensational.

Very James Dean.

Undoubtedly the ugliest
corpse I've ever seen.

You probably would look
better six feet under.

What about the high speed car crash?
I'm supposed to be a m-mangled wreck. Right?

Mm. Internal injuries.
Happens all the time.

Okay. If someone wants to touch
my hands, they'll be warm.

For fuck's sake, Dylan,
it isn't a petting zoo.

All right.

Nobody will touch you-

Just don't yawn or you'll give
some poor bastard a heart attack.

You sure your parents
don't read the obituaries?

No, they don't.
Even if they did, they wouldn't be here.

Show time, Dracula.

Where's the money, Charlie?

Answer me, you
junkie bitch!

Ah. For God's sake, Dylan,
it's getting late.

That was a stupid idea.

You win the bet.

All the apple juice
you can drink on me.

Dylan.

Sleep tight.

Decko.

Dylan O'Rourke.

What the fuck
did you do?

Where the fuck
are you going? Huh?

You're watching me, huh?

I bet you're watching me right now.
You're probably wondering who the fuck I am, right?

Hey, you know what?

You know what the two shortest
verses in the Bible are?

It's only two-two
words. Just two words.

Isn't that amazing?

It's only
got two words.

Were you
friends with him?

No.

So, how'd
you know him?

I read the obituaries.

How'd he die anyway?

Car crash.

Yeah, they say better to be late,
you know, in this life than

early in the next.

Do you make a habit out of
going to memorial services?

Well, you know, I'll be honest to you.
I try to go as many as possible.

You know, during the week 'cause
it's kinda great therapy, right?

I mean, you should
really try it.

You should. If you're ever feeling
depressed, just go to a funeral.

And no matter how sad or how
low or had bad things are,

it's never as final
as this, right?

You wanna die?

I wanna go without a clear
conscience, you know.

I wouldn't-wouldn't wanna go without that.
Not 'til I'm ready.

I don't wanna-don't wanna go
without making amends.

Red roses, well.

Dylan, I guess
you were special.

I'll leave you
two alone.

I have me good
looks and a wee bit of money

â™ª Now all I need is a
pretty little honey â™ª

â™ª I'm off to Dublin
At the end of the year â™ª

â™ª For a bit
Of a laugh â™ª

â™ª For the women
And the beer â™ª

Ah, all the black
stuff I can drink.

Well, I thought you
didn't drink, lad.

Today's a good day
as any to start.

All right. So, this
weird girl shows up.

She shows up, she starts
talking about, uh,

the shortest verse
in the Bible.

That's the best
mass to attend.

In and out,
short and sweet.

And suddenly
I-I hear this voice.

The weird
girl's voice?

No. Natalie's voice.

Natalie?
The old flame?

Natalie's there alone and
she leans over the coffin.

I can't be sure, but I think
she said â€I love you.â€

I miss you.

She did?

Well, I--she whispered
it, you know.

But it was "I-I something you."

So, you didn't
hear the "love" part.

Not really.

So, she could've
said "I hate you."

Possibly, but why would she drive
all the way down to a funeral home

to say "I hate you"?

Did she bring flowers?

Dozen red roses.

Not yellow
or pink. Red.

Your old flame came
to your wake, Dylan.

She brought roses!

That says a lot
about your character.

Yeah, maybe.

Right, I show up at her door?
Knocking? She'd be furious.

She thinks I'm dead.

Your own brother wouldn't
talk to you in six years.

He's your brother.

You should see her.

Seems to me she was sent to
you by the big guy himself.

Hey, one last thing.

I got you a wee little present,
so we can all remember you.

On your way home tonight,
stop by the cemetery

and check out that
empty plot 35-E.

I got you
your own grave.

Now you Te
really dead, lad.

Don't go in there.

Excuse me?

Hey, asshole.

You're in the wrong place.
There's nothing here to steal.

Just put down
the gun.

It's Dylan.

Dylan?

Dylan O'Rourke.

Dylan?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's me.

Dylan?

Are you sure you're here
for the right person?

I knew you were coming. I just didn't,
I just didn't know it'd be so soon.

I-I'm sorry. I can-I can
explain everything.

Just tell me where
you're gonna take me.

What are you
talking about?

Just tell me where
you're gonna take me.

No, I-I don't understand.
I'm not taking you anywhere.

I need to know
where I'm going.

I think you're
a little confused.

I'm not confused.
I know what you are.

I know what you are.

Fuck!

Where's the money, Charlie?

Where's the
fucking money?

Who the fuck
are you? Huh?

Who the fuck is
this, Charlie? Huh?

Answer me, you fucking
junkie bitch!

What? He's just
a friend of yours?

He's not
my friend.

He's my guardian angel.

Guardian fucking
angel, huh?

Well, we got
a little problem here.

I'm an atheist.

I don't believe in
little faggoty angels.

Go ahead, shoot him.

He's already dead.
Shoot him.

Just shoot him!

What the fuck?

Idiot.

I told you
you were dead.

Who was that guy
at your place?

Terrence?

He works for some guy
I owe 20 grand to.

L-I-I- should be,
I should be dead.

Should be?
You are dead.

So us poor
trapped souls.

I've always kinda
been obsessed with dying,

and it's my death.

I'm not ready
to go, yet.

Why aren't
you ready?

Family?

No, no family left.

Friends or something?

No, never even
been in a carpool lane.

I got nothing.

As soon as I'm clean, I'm
gonna go with you. I promise.

I'm not actually dead.

You are dead.
You just don't know it.

Excuse me.
Can you see me?

Yeah.

Okay. You satisfied?

Wait, wait, wait.
Could you, could you touch me?

Excuse me?

Just-just touch
my face.

Case. I mean, does that, does that
prove to you that I'm not dead?

You're in denial.

I mean, she-she
saw me, she touched me.

How could she do
that if I was dead?

How could I interact
with people?

Because you believe
it so intensely

that you've become real to
yourself and to others.

Believing is seeing.

So, anybody
could be dead.

Like-like-like
this, that guy?

Could be.

Walking dead are all around us.
I feel bad for you.

You're just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.

So, how do I get
out of Purgatory?

Well, first of all, you need
to accept that you're dead.

Then I think you have one more
chance to make things right.

What's it like?

What's what like?

What made you die.

Are you crazy?

Don't call me that.

I am not crazy.
You just leave me the fuck alone

until you're ready to deal with
who the fuck you are, okay?

Then you can
come find me.

You are dead.
You just don't know it.

Hey, fuck Charlie.

Fuck us instead.

Oh. What's wrong, Dylan?

What'd you say?

How do you
know my name?

I didn't say anything.

Come on, sweetie.

Let me call you whatever
you want us to call you.

Charlie?

Charlie?

Charlie, let me in.

Charlie? Open the door.

Oh! Fuck!

Oh, no.

Charlie. Hey.
Wake up.

Somebody help!

Come on.
Fuck, come on!

Charlie!

What are you
doing, Charlie?

And where are
you right now?

You said you didn't wanna
leave like this, right?

You're not dead, and
I'm not, either. Okay?

I'm gonna be around
for a little while.

Visiting hours are now over.

Sir, visiting hours are over.
It's time to leave.

Dylan?

Natalie.

Oh, God.
I'm-I'm so sorry.

I can explain everything.

That funeral,
we faked it.

I'm not dead.

I mean, obviously,
I'm not dead.

I'm really sorry.

I know. I know you
faked your funeral.

And you're not dead.

Decko?

Did he invite you
to the funeral?

He didn't want
you to be alone.

How do you
know Charlie?

Are you on her
emergency contact list?

I'm kinda all
she has right now.

Yeah, but after that,

Remember when we broke into the rec
center and we went skinny dipping?

Yes.

That was fun. We were starving,
and we went to that place.

Burger place with
those huge burgers.

Yeah.

Bacon and fried egg and
there was, like, ham on it.

I don't like
the special sauce.

Can you hear mine?

Yeah.

Can you hear it?

Didn't we go?
Didn't we run out of gas?

Oh, yeah. It was that night.
We ran out of gas.

We called, we had
to, we called--

AAA

That was fun.

Oh, hold on.

Hi, honey.

Oh, no, no, I'm just busy at work.
I'll be home soon.

Okay. All right. Bye.

Dylan.

I would've gone
to your funeral regardless.

[monitor alarm sets 0177

Are you okay?

I'm okay.

Hi. What are
you doing here?

I knew I'd
find you here.

It's where you always come
when you wanna be alone.

Yeah. Mm-hm.

Oh, my God.

What do you say?

Yes.

I haven't been here
since we graduated.

Do you blame me
for that night?

Every time I saw you,
I thought of what happened.

I've missed you.
I missed you every day for ten years.

You're in love
with someone else!

No. I love Steve.
But I'm in love with you.

Dylan?

I brought Dylan a couple of my
famous roast beef sandwiches.

Can I leave
them with you?

Sure.

Good. We can
have a smoke then.

How long have
you been married, Liz?

Um, almost 25 years.

He's a little
much at times,

but no matter how dirty
his laundry, he's mine.

Oh. I do

carry this
little DUI photo

to remind him what an asshole
he can be when he's drunk.

I would've married
Decko since I met him,

but he made me wait.

Why?

I was with the man I thought I'd
spend the rest of my life with.

And I fell in love
with his best friend.

Over time I
questioned myself,

and now and then I still wonder
if I chose the right partner.

So, you went
back to Decko?

No. I stayed with Decko.

He was the best friend.

Decko?

Mm-hm.

What happened to--

Patrick Keating?

Mm, oh.

My beautiful ghost.

I imagine
he thinks of me,

that there's a candle burning
out there somewhere.

Do you love Decko?

Absolutely.

But I do believe it's
possible to love two people.

When you're on
your deathbed,

don't look back on
your life with regret.

It is a hard
life to live.

Wondering.

Natalie.

Hey.

Can I talk to you?

Yeah.

Uh, listen.

God, I-I don't even
know where to begin.

Really. Um, I just--

[monitor alarm sets 0177

That's Charlie.

What's wrong with her?

You're okay, Charlie.
Just relax.

Hey, you Te okay.

I'm sorry, sir, but
you need to step out.

Dylan, I 'Il come
and get you-

Has he made his
peace with you, yet?

Who?

Dylan.

Never stops
thinking about you.

What are you
doing here?

I don't know what
she has right now.

Where's the money, Charlie?

I thought you
were dead.

You shouldn't screw
with people like that.

Prank?

It was more of a
reality check.

Got that address
you wanted.

Listen, you
shouldn't go there.

Why?

It's not the guy who took a shot at you you
have to be worried about. It's his boss.

Who's his boss?

Just tell me who she owes money to.
I'm sure I can make a deal.

These aren't the type of people
you just make deals with.

Get some sleep.

Seeing shit
that isn't there.

How much money
are we talking about?

Twenty grand.

You really care
about this girl?

You know, I've been the
only one to visit her.

Just like she was the
only one to visit me.

That's a hell of a lot of money.
How are you gonna get that?

Don't worry
about the money.

Look, I don't understand.
You hardly know this girl.

Think of yourself.
Go to college, start your life.

Be fucking selfish
for once, can you?

Why--

Why are you
doing this?

I have to save somebody.

I'm here to see
Mr. Brennan.

Tell him I'd like to
make a deal for Charlie.

So, how do you
know Charlie?

Is she a friend
of yours?

You could say that.

Now, that's not what
Terrence told me.

He says you're her,
uh, guardian angel.

Well, now, Terrence,

atheist. Comes back
here ranting and raving

about some halo,
wing-wearing wacko

that he puts
two slugs into.

I saw the holes
in the wall.

He missed twice.

I told you Terrence

was a useless
piece of shit.

He can't even
shoot straight.

So you, you wanna make a
deal for Charlie, hm?

It's 20 for
her debt.

Goddamn.

I feel like putting
a bullet in my own gun

just to see if you really
are a fucking angel.

Charlie's debt's repaid.

You have my word.

And everybody knows
what that means.

Where'd you
get that one?

Hi. Have you done it?
Have you made your peace?

I really need you
to hurry, okay?

'Cause I'm really ready to go.
I'm ready to go now.

Ready to leave
this life. I'm clean.

I just have
to ask you something.

This, this ring, it--

I-I found it in

the pawn shop.

Brennan said that
you pawned it.

Ten years ago.

Did you pawn this?

Answer me. Where did-- Where
did you get this, Charlie?

Where did
you get this?

There was an accident.

Charlie, the people who were
killed were my parents!

This was my mother's.

Who was driving
that taxi?

I needed money.

I stole the taxi.

And I picked up
the fare.

I lost control.

It was an accident.

You what?
You stole this?

Dylan, I'm so sorry.

Don't you
fucking touch me.

What do you
need, kid?

I'm looking for
Detective Milano.

Milano? He's not
here anymore.

Do you know when
he'll be back?

He died
five years ago.

I just saw him
the other night.

Don't think so.

That--

That-that can't be.

Are you okay?

You seeing shit
that isn't there.

Dylan.

Are you okay, lad?

What's the biggest
funeral you ever have?

Hm. About
ten years ago.

We had a standing
mourning service.

Spilled out
into the street.

I had to borrow chairs.

That was my
parents' funeral.

I don't remember
you there.

That's because
I wasn't there.

I couldn't be.

They were there
because of me.

I mean, Christ, I haven't even
visited their grave.

I was supposed
to pick them up

from the airport.

When I didn't show,
eventually they took a cab.

That taxi crashed.

I was with Natalie
when I found out.

I blamed her.

I blame myself.

That's the night I left her.

You know, we made plans
to go to college together, and

we put it on hold.

My fucking life.

My whole--

That guilt has been eating you
alive inside for too long.

You're gonna let
it destroy you.

As it should.

No. Listen to me, son.

Don't call me "son".

You leave me the fuck alone.
Get that through your head. I don't want your help.

Leave me the
fuck alone!

You listen to me, boy.
You have got to forgive yourself.

I can't!

You can!
Stop living in the fucking past!

Don't you understand?
The past is all I have.

I have nothing else.
You get that?

No! You have
a life now!

You have me.

Now.

And Dylan, you
have Natalie.

Oh, God.

I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

Forget about the past.

She's come back to you.

Don't let her
get away again.

That gin.

Every time I see
that girl's face,

I think about
that night.

I think about what I did
and what I didn't do.

Forget about what
you didn't do.

It's what you're going
to do now that counts.

Hi.

Hey, babe. You,
uh, got some mail.

Steve! Why did you wait so many
years to ask me to marry you?

I-I woke up and
I realized what I had.

Was Charlie Scheel released?

No, but she just
suddenly took off.

I'm ready to leave this life.
I'm clean.

Hey, Natalie. This
is Linda from Mercy.

I have a message from your patient, Charlie Scheel.
She said it's urgent.

What are you
doing, Charlie?

Jesus wept.

That's the shortest
verse in the Bible.

Charlie, come on.
You're making me nervous.

Jesus went to visit
his sick friend Lazarus.

But he was too late, and
Lazarus was already dead.

But instead of just
grieving for him,

he resurrected him.

That's what
you've done for me.

How did you do it? Did you
make your peace, yet?

No.

I'm getting so bored
of this, Dylan.

Waiting for you.

You know what, Charlie?
You Te gonna have to keep waiting.

You and I?

Have been walking
dead for years now.

Me and you.

This could be
our Resurrection Day.

Charlie!

Charlie, if you jump,
I am not coming with you.

I'm still in love with Natalie,
and I'm gonna be with her.

You hear that, Natalie?

I'm sorry I haven't
visited sooner.

But it's better to be
late in this life

than early
in the next.

Rest in peace.

I've always
loved the bastard.

He's got a lot
of really good pubs.

He means colleges.
Now, make sure you keep focused, Dylan.

Fresh starts.
No regrets, love.

I know.

The French believe every time you
say goodbye, you die a little.

But what do the fucking
French know?

You've been a
really good friend.

Thank you.

Drive safely.

Thank you.

Take care. Take care.

We'll be back.

You ready?

Yeah.

So, if I turn the ring around and the
heart points in, that means I'm taken.

Correct.

Okay.

That looks better.

Thank you.

What was it like?

What's what like?

What made you die.

Walking dead are
all around us.

She saw me. She touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?

How could I
interact with people?

You believe it
so intensely

that you've become real
to yourself and to others.

Believing is seeing.

You Te just trapped
in Purgatory.

Really could go
either way for you.

So, how do I get
out of Purgatory?

First of all, you need to
accept that you Te dead.

Then I think you have one more
chance to make things right.

You wanna die?

I don't wanna-wanna go
without making amends.

So, what do you guys have
planned after graduation?

We're going
to college together.

Oh, so, keeping
it alive, huh?

Yeah. Forever. Forever.

â™ª Feels like
We're in a dream â™ª

â™ª Shadows of life
Without meaning â™ª

â™ª Distorted scenes,
Reliving memories â™ª

â™ª That we can
Never change â™ª

â™ª Won't this
Dream ever end â™ª

â™ª Colors are so grey â™ª

â™ª And night never
turns to day â™ª

â™ª Love feels so far
across the sea â™ª

â™ª Even when
it's next to me â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª From this dream
that never ends â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª So my soul
can make amends â™ª

â™ª Take me to the dawn â™ª

â™ª And wake me from
this endless night â™ª

â™ª Let's try again â™ª

â™ª I'll be the friend
you needed then â™ª

â™ª Fight the pain,
It's still the same â™ª

â™ª Bu! now I know the way â™ª

â™ª Takes time to heal â™ª

â™ª And make me whole â™ª

â™ª And free my
troubled dreams â™ª

â™ª Touch me now â™ª

â™ª I can 'I wait to go â™ª

Relive the past,
Can't take it anymore

â™ª The hardest chore â™ª

â™ª The thought of
losing you again â™ª

â™ª Push me to the end â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª From this dream
that never ends â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª So my soul
can make amends â™ª

â™ª Take me to the dawn â™ª

â™ª And wake me from
this endless night â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª From this dream
that never ends â™ª

â™ª Wake me â™ª

â™ª So my soul
can make amends â™ª

â™ª Take me to the dawn â™ª

â™ª And wake me from
this endless night â™ª
