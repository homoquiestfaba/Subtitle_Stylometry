DRIVER:
Hello! Down there!

Oh, my.
That's not good.

That's not
good at all.

Good morning there, friend!

Looks like you're in a particularly
precarious predicament.

Call the police!
Call the fire department!

Call everybody!

You're in Adventure Bay.

Here, we call
the PAW Patrol!

You're gonna call the who?

<i>â™ª PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol</i>

<i>â™ª PAW Patrol â™ª</i>

RYDER ON RADIO: <i>All
right, pups, here we go.</i>

<i>Let's work together
out there.</i>

Rocky, I need you to shut down
the bridge and control traffic.

Arf! Flares!



Zuma, I need you to keep
that waterway clear.

Nobody under the bridge.

ZUMA: You got it, Ryder!

Waterway secure!
(BEEPING)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Chase, it's all
up to you.

Use the winch in your pup pack to get
the driver and bring him to safety!

Chase is on the case!

Arf!
Grappling hook!


Sir, don't be alarmed.
I'm coming down!

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank
you, the rescue team is here!

A dog?

Actually, sir,
I'm a puppy.

A baby dog?
That's even worse!

You're in shock, so I'm not
going to take that personally.

Now, let's get you
out of here.

No way! I'm waiting
right here for a real rescue.

(BANGING)
Ahhh!

I changed my mind,
I'll go with you!

Ryder! These cables aren't
going to hold much longer!

Let's go, Chase.
Get him out of there!

CHASE: We're coming out!

Oh! Oh!

Don't panic.
I need you to stay calm.

No deal!
I'm freaking out!

Then you're really
not going to like this!

Ahhh!

We're not going to make it.
We're not going to make it!

Ah!

You can open
your eyes now.

Oh, we made it. (LAUGHING)

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Great work,
PAW Patrol!

(ROOSTER CROWING)

Everybody
get back!

The truck's leaking gas!
(PEOPLE GASPING)

Oh, come on,
that's not gas.

That's the stuff I've been
hauling from coast to coast.

That is pure
Canadian maple syrup!

Okay, time to
clean up this mess.

Deploy waffles, pancakes,
and French toast!



It's okay, little guy,
you're safe.

You can
come out now.


Let's get you
back to your family.


There you go.


Great work, pups.

Another perfect rescue.

Oh! Um...

Hey. Excuse me?

You dropped something.

I'm done with it.

Buzz off, wiener dog.

"Wiener dog"?

Maybe you should just pick that
up and put it in the trash!


Yeah? Or what?

Or I'm going to pick you up
and put you in the trash.

(PEOPLE GASPING)

Hey, I don't want no trouble.

I'm pickin' up the trash,
I'm pickin' up the trash.

Thank you. We've all got
to take pride in our city.

Don't ever forget that.

Mayor Humdinger.

Ugh!

Just saying it
makes my skin crawl.

No dogs.

By order of the new mayor.

Excuse me?
Yeah, you heard him.

No dogs.

He's more of a cat person.

Now beat it!

If those are the rules,
those are the rules.

have a wonderful day.

Ha-ha!
Did you see that?

You gotta show these
dogs you're the alpha.

You're not the alpha.
I'm the alpha!

No, I'm the alpha!
No, I'm the alpha!

I'm the

Right this

I'm the alpha!
No. I'm the alpha!


Thanks for the lift!
WOMAN: Happy to help.

Excuse me, coming through,

(PARTY HORN BLOWING)

Really?
Yeah...

<i>I want to start off

<i>to be your new mayor.</i>

You were the only
name on the ballot!

<i>You could only vote for one name

<i>I won this election
fair and square.</i>

Well, maybe not fair,
but who's keeping track?


<i>You know, they call this place
Adventure City,</i>

(PHONE RINGING)

PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?

<i>What? You answer
your own calls?</i>

<i>Oh, my goodness,
I didn't even think I was gonna...</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>I can't believe
I'm looking at the PAW Patrol!</i>

<i>I am such a big fan!
This is off the leash!</i>

Is there something
we can help you with?

<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

<i>My name is Liberty,
and I'm calling from Adventure City.</i>

<i>Something terrible
has happened.</i>

<i>Humdinger was just
elected mayor.</i>

ALL: Humdinger?

He's the worst mayor
in the history of mayors!

And that's
being generous.

<i>You're telling me,
this guy's a disaster!</i>

<i>He's going to destroy
the whole city.</i>

<i>Please, we need your help.</i>

<i>Come quickly!</i>

Adventure City's in trouble.

Come on, pups,
pack your things.

No city's too big,
no pup's too small!

(BARKING AND HOWLING)

Yeah!

What's wrong, Chase?

I'm not going.

We have to go.
They need us.

I'm never going back to
Adventure City!

Chase...

What's got his leash in a knot?

Chase has a history
with Adventure City.

He has a lot of tough memories
from that place.

<i>He was abandoned there
as a pup.</i>

<i>The city was so big,
and he was so small.</i>

(CARS HONKING)


(PEOPLE CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY)

<i>It was a hard life.</i>



(GASPS)
(TIRES SCREECHING)

The city can be a scary place
when you're all alone.

Is that where you found him?
That's right.

And I brought him back here
to Adventure Bay.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Chase?

Let's talk
about this.

I don't want to go back to
Adventure City.

I know it was tough,
but that was a long time ago.

I'm afraid
if I go back there,

everyone will see I'm still
that scared little puppy,

and not the hero
they think I am.

I promise it will be nothing
like it was when you were little.

Everything will be fine.

Come on, Chase.
Those people need our help.

We're the PAW Patrol,
this is what we do.

Trust me.

Okay. I trust you.

Now, can I get a yelp?

(HOWLS SOFTLY)

Come on. You can do
better than that.

(HOWLING EMPHATICALLY)

Attaboy!
Let's get to work.

Skye, Chase, Rocky,
Marshall, Zuma...

(METAL CREAKING)

Rubble!

It's not my fault!
I couldn't decide what to bring.

So I brought everything!


Get there, come on.
Come on, come on!

See? It fits!

Wake up, pups,
we're here!

Oh, wow!

Check it out!
Cool!

No way!
It's amazing!

SKYE: This place is so much
bigger than Adventure Bay.

You okay, Chase?

It's a lot bigger
than I remember.

It's like they super-sized it!

(RAIN POURING)

(CAR HONKING)

HUMDINGER: Ugh! Rain!

Does it always rain
in this lousy city?

(THUNDER CRASHING)



(GLASS BREAKING)

Okay, which one of you
eggheads is in charge?

Hello!
Gah!

I'm the lead egghead.
Kendra Wilson.

Hmm.

I've got a fireworks
celebration tonight

and they're going to cancel
it because of the rain.

I hear you have a weather
machine that sucks up clouds.

Is that true?

You're looking at it.

It's a free-floating
gyroscopically balanced

remote-controlled weather
containment and analysis apparatus.

What? I don't understand
a word you just said.

Well... (LAUGHS)

We call it the Cloud Catcher.

It flies around
and sucks up clouds,

then brings them back to the
lab so we can study them.

Excellent,
excellent.

Well, kitties, it looks like our
bad weather problem is solved.

I want all those pesky rain clouds
sucked up by the end of the day.

Oh! I'm sorry
if I wasn't clear.

The Cloud Catcher is for
studying clouds,

not for changing
the weather.

And I'm sorry
if I wasn't clear.

Suck up those clouds or I'm
closing this university forever!

(PEOPLE GASPING)

Well...

I guess we could try using
it to clear the rain clouds.

Just for tonight.
Wonderful!

That's what I call
scientific consensus!




Oh!

My top hat!

Here you go, boss.

(MACHINE BEEPING)

(EPIC MUSIC PLAYING)


That's incredible!

(LAUGHING AND
SINGING JOYFULLY)

We'll have the sky
clear by sundown.

Ugh! I've got a bad
feeling about this.

I'll hang on to this remote!

People are going to
love these fireworks,

and more importantly,
they're going to love me!

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

All right, pups,
keep an eye out for the new headquarters.

We're almost there.
Yeah!

Cool!
I can't wait!

Where is it?
There are so many buildings!

I wonder
which one it is.

ALL: Whoa!

RYDER: Oh.

Yeah.
Couldn't have missed that.

(EPIC MUSIC PLAYING)

ALL: Whoa!

Welcome to our new
Adventure City headquarters.

Whoa!
Wow!

Awesome!

Now that's a view!

How can we afford
this place?

This stuff sells

We've got everything we need
at our fingertips.

Ahhh! (GRUNTS)

(PUPS LAUGHING)

Marshall!
Marshall!

Next time, warn me before you
stick a building up my nose!


This is
so cool!

It's so high-tech!

And check this out.

There's even a new and
improved pup treat dispenser.

(EPIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(SINGING A HIGH NOTE)


What? It's a
beautiful thing.

Last but not least,
this is our mission prep area.

Everybody's got
their own cubby.

Oh, Oh, Oh!
I want that one!

RYDER: No, Rubble, don't!
No, cubby belongs to...

Yeesh! This is less
than spectacular.

You, ponytail man!

Why are you taking so long
between fireworks?

I'm building
momentum, man.

I have a whole routine
mapped out in my head.

Nobody's got time for your
self-indulgent,

hippy-dippy art project.

They want spectacle!

Oh! Wow!

How often do you get to see
fireworks this close?

My top hat!

Here you go, boss!
Ahhh!


This is why
dogs hate fireworks!

Whoa...

(FIREWORKS EXPLODING
IN THE DISTANCE)

I'm no expert,

but aren't fireworks supposed
to explode in the sky?

Let's see what's going on!

It looks like Mayor
Humdinger's fireworks display

has turned into
a fireworks disaster.

We've got to stop those fireworks
before they burn down the city.

Time to suit up!

We spoke on the phone.

So nice to finally
meet you in person.

Ryder.

What your team needs
is a pup like me.

I know the city

Uptown, downtown,
crosstown, midtown.

24-7, 365, I'll get you

Well, we could use a hand

That's what I'm talking about.

Okay!

It was amazing!

You look okay.

How do you feel?

I can't believe I forgot
to disconnect my parachute.

It's Air Rescue 101.

Well, that's why
we're a team.

Everyone pulled together,

But what if
they didn't?

What if something happened to those

You better stay off

Hey, Liberty.
Take one for the road!

Thank you!






Another perfect day

Enjoy that sunbeam, kitties.


Mr. Mayor!

The Cloud Catcher's hygrometer
is overloading the capacity

of its pressurized internal
containment chamber!

What? Do I look like

We need to bring down
the Cloud Catcher now!

And ruin this

Nonsense!

loop-de-loopiest subway

the world has ever seen!

Mmm-mmm. I am not
riding that thing.

Mr. Mayor,
Mr. Mayor!

Have you considered the possibility
that this is the single dumbest idea

I'm an unqualified

What's the worst

that surprised nobody,

the shoddily built
upside-down subway

turned out to be
a steaming hot pile of,

<i>dare I say, poop.</i>

(TRUCK HONKING)

GIRL: <i>Look, Mom,
the PAW Patrol!</i>

(SIRENS BLARING)

I can't believe Humdinger
thought this was a good idea.

The subway's wild enough
without a stinkin' loop-de-loop!

Hey, Liberty!

Reporting for duty.

Unofficially, of course.
You know, like an honorary member.

(METAL CREAKING)
(GASPS)

Rocky, I need you
to stabilize that loop.

Rubble, see if you can
lock it into place

with some
quick-dry cement.

BOTH: We're on it!

RYDER: Skye, I need you to
secure that loop from the air.

Let's take to the sky!

(CROWD CHEERING)

Don't worry, Ryder, I've got
crowd control under control.

Stand back!
Give us some space!

PAW Patrol at work!

I'm an honorary member
at the moment,

but my authority
should still be respected.


Arf! Hydraulic arms!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Gotcha!

Hey, look!
It's Skye!

Time for a little more power.

Arf! Afterburners!

Okay, Rubble, let 'er rip!


Rubble on the double!

RUBBLE: The track is secure!

SKYE: Yeah, Rubble!

Nice work, Rubble!

Chase, we've got to
rescue those people.

Are you up for it?

Chase is on the case.


(EPIC MUSIC PLAYING)


(PASSENGERS PANICKING)

Hang on!
You're going to be okay.

Arf! Zipline!

(PASSENGERS CHEERING)

PASSENGERS: (CHEERING)
Chase! Chase! Chase!

RYDER: <i>How are you
holding up, Chase?</i>

I'm fine.

<i>Are you sure?</i>

I can do this!

PASSENGERS: Chase! Chase!
You can do it, Chase!

I can do this.

PASSENGERS: Chase! Chase!

I can do this.

I can...



(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

RYDER: <i>Chase?
Chase, do you copy?</i>

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

Ryder, we've got a problem.

What's going on?

It's Chase.
Something's wrong.

He's just standing there.

Chase is in trouble.
Skye, bring him down.

Marshall, get your ladder up
to the train.

I'm on it!

(SIREN BLARING)


(SIREN BLARING)

I think I can
reach them from here.

Arf! Ladder!


MARSHALL ON SPEAKER: <i>Please exit the
train and proceed down the ladder.</i>

(PEOPLE CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY)

This should speed things up.

Arf! Ladder slide!

Here goes nothing!

Whoo-hoo!

RYDER: <i>Nice work, Marshall!</i>

Chase?

I'm coming out to get you.

What's wrong?

Tell me what happened.

I don't know.

I just froze.

It's okay. Everyone's safe.
Let's get you down.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Okay, that's all of them.

Good job, pups.

Chase...

I don't know
what happened.

I'm just glad
you're okay.

I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault.

I thought you'd be
okay in Adventure City,

but it's still
too much for you.

I'll be fine.
I just need to...

You're not fine.
You need to take a break.

We'll take care of the
rescues for a while.

What? No!

That's not fair.

I'm sorry, Chase.

I know it's hard,
but it's the way it's got to be.

I didn't even want to
come to Adventure City!

I trusted you.

You said everything would be
fine, but it's not!

What kind of leader gives up on
someone the second things get hard?

Chase...

Chase, wait!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)


RUBEN: Oh-ho!

What do we
have here?

Looks like we got one of them
PAW Patrols all on his own.

Get the net.
(LAUGHING)

RYDER: Chase? Chase!

Come on, Chase.
Chase?

Chase!

Hey, buddy,
where are you?

Where'd you go, bud? Chase!

Oh, no.
Where did he go?

I was right
behind him.

I turned the corner
and he was gone.

He just disappeared.

What are we going to do?
I don't know.

There's no way for us to track him
if he's not wearing his pup tag.

We might not have
a tracking collar,

but the city has eyes,
and the city has ears.

Somebody had
to see something.

Okay.
Where do we start?

We need to pound
the pavement.

I'll get my jackhammer!
(PUPS LAUGHING)

No, not like that.

"Pound the pavement" means we're
gonna need to talk to everyone.

Ask questions.

Leave no
stone unturned.

Then I'll get the stone turning
attachment for my dozer.

(PUPS LAUGHING)

Can someone please
explain it to him?


Out of the way!
Learn to drive!

Someone should take away
his license.


Stop this vehicle right now!

I'm a police dog
and you're under arrest!

Oh, no!
You hear that, Butch?

We're under arrest.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, why do you get
to wear the hat?

'Cause I took
it from him!

Well, I'm taking it
from you!

Give me that back, it's my hat! My hat!
No, it's my hat!

(BOTH GROANING)

Hey, hands on
the wheel!

Ahhh!

So unprofessional!


(DOGS BARKING)

(CHASE GRUNTING)

Quit squirming!



Put me down!
Let me go!

(CHASE GRUNTS)
(DOOR BUZZING)

Welcome to your
new home.



What is this place?

It's Fuzzy Buddies
Obedience School!

Isn't it awesome?
What?

We're gonna learn
so many new tricks,

like sit, and roll over,
and, uh, sit.

Ugh, Barney, how many times
do I have to tell you?

It's not
an obedience school anymore.

Mayor Humdinger's goons
took over this place

and turned it into a jail.

Old Humdinger's
not exactly a dog lover.

He's more of a cat person.

(MOANING IN DISGUST)

He's rounding up all
the dogs in the city,

and locking us
in here.

That's terrible.

Never let your
guard down in here.

There's one guy you
gotta watch out for.

He'll sneak up behind you
when you least expect it.

There he is!

Don't worry, guys,
I'll protect you!

Leave my friends alone! Ow!


(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

He got away!

I gotta get
out of here.

So what's your
story, kid?

I don't even
know anymore.

I thought I was a member
of the PAW Patrol.

But now I feel like they're
better off without me.

What makes you say
a thing like that?

I keep messing up
and letting everyone down.

with all this negativity.

Just ignore her.
She's all bark and no bite.

Now pick yourself
a doghouse.

You're gonna be
here awhile.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE)

Come on, in here!

(BELL TINKLING)

Liberty!

<i>Que gusto verte!</i>

How's life treating
you these days?

Carmen, I got
no time for chitchat.

We're in a jam
and we need your help.

Have you seen
this dog?

No, I haven't
seen him.

If you want, you can put
his picture up on the wall.

Whoa...

Lots of dogs
going missing lately.

I'm keeping
my eyes open

but it's like
they just disappear.

How long has this
been happening?

It started
a couple days ago.

Now, half my customers
are missing a dog.

This can't be a coincidence.

Somebody's got to be
taking them.

Dog-napping?
Who would do that?

Humdinger!
It's got to be him.

He hates dogs
more than anything.

But where is he
taking them?

I think I know
how we can find out.

How?
I'm a dog.

I'm also kind of an honorary
member of the PAW Patrol,

so I'll be
the bait.

I get captured,
you tail me,

and boom, we find out
where he's taking them.

That might actually work.

We just need to figure out how
to get Humdinger's attention.

Leave that to me.

<i>Marty Muckraker here,
bringing you an exclusive interview</i>

<i>with recently disgraced
Mayor Humdinger.</i>

<i>Thanks, Marty.</i>

<i>After today's
little subway snafu,</i>

<i>I just wanted to assure
the public</i>

<i>there will be no more
embarrassing mishaps.</i>

(LIBERTY SCREAMS)
<i>Ahhh!</i>

<i>Put a cork in it,
windbag!</i>

Somebody get this filthy dog away from me!
(LIBERTY LAUGHS)

Gotcha!


Please! Let me go!

Don't take me to exactly the same
place you took the other dogs,

in this white van,
license plate number YVP 8624!

You, with the pants
on your head,

get me a new pair of pants.
Right away, sir!

When my new pants arrive,

we'll take this interview
from the top.

Um... Mr. Mayor,
we're live.


<i>Ahhh!</i>
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

<i>If this goes viral,
I'm canceling the Internet!</i>


Get back here!
I'm gonna get you!


(DOOR BUZZING)

Was this one easier to catch,
or are we getting better at this?

Oh-ho-ho! We're definitely
getting better at this.

(CHUCKLING)
(DOOR LOCKING)

Chase? Chase?

Anybody here seen a German Shepherd
about yay high, always saying,

"Chase is on the case"?

Liberty?

Hey, buddy!

I came to bust you
out of here.

Puh-lease.

This scrawny little purse pup
is going to pull a jailbreak?

You talk a lot of trash for a dog
who looks like a toilet brush.

Hmph!

Come on, Chase,
get up.

You shouldn't have
come after me.

Now we're both
stuck in here.

Of course
I came after you.

I might just be one small pup,
all alone in the big city,

but I can still
make a difference.

I can still be a hero,
just like you.

I'm no hero.
Yeah, right.

And I'm a purebred
show dog with papers.

Oh... You're serious.

I used to think I was a hero,
but it turns out I'm just scared.

So? Who cares
if you're scared?

Heroes get scared
all the time.

They do?
Of course they do.

But even though they're scared,
they push through and keep going.

That's what
makes them heroes.

While you chew over that
knowledge I just dropped,

I'm gonna get us outta here.

We're stuck
in here, Liberty.

That door is always locked,
and it's the only way out.

Well, there's one thing
I forgot to mention.


I brought backup!

Rubble!
On the double!

<i>â™ª Three, two, one, go â™ª</i>

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

ALL: Yeah!

Chase!

(DOOR BUZZING)

What's going on in here?

(DOORS BUZZING)

DOG: Yes, we're free!

All right, pups, let's roll.
(HOWLING)

Chase,
you ride with me.

(RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING)

LIBERTY: Whoa!
You cool back there, Liberty?

LIBERTY: I'm doing
great! Ahhh!


Come on, you bucket of bolts,
don't quit on me now!

Chase and I have
to make a stop.

We'll meet you back
at headquarters.

MARSHALL: Aye aye, Ryder, sir!
See you there.

(METALLIC CREAKING)

CHASE: Where are we going?

RYDER: There's something
I need to show you.

Do you remember
this place?

This is where
I found you.

Why would you
bring me here?

I know this place reminds you
of the worst time in your life.

But there's more
to it than that.

It's also
a great place.

I remember the first
time I saw you.

You were a tiny little pup,
all alone in the big city.


(TIRES SCREECHING)

(GASPS)
(CAR HONKING)

I know. You saw me
and took pity on me.

Not at all.

<i>What I saw was a brave,
heroic pup.</i>

<i>Even though you were too small
to look after yourself,</i>

<i>and you were up against
all those scary things,</i>

<i>you got back up
and kept going.</i>

<i>I didn't adopt you
because I felt sorry for you.</i>

<i>I chose you because you were
the bravest pup I'd ever seen.</i>

I know Adventure City
has been tough for you,

but I also know that deep down
you were born to be a hero.

So, what do you say?
Wanna go to work?

Ready for action,
Ryder sir.


(BEEPING AND CLANKING)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)



Here you go, boss.

Let's make history.

Mayor Humdinger!
Ahhh!

Don't sneak up
on me like that.

The Cloud Catcher's
precipometer has short-circuited

and the barometric pressure has
dropped below 87 kilopascals!

What? I never know
what you're talking about.

Dumb it down for me!

We've got to bring down the Cloud
Catcher, it's gonna blow!

Hogwash! Give me that.

What are you doing?

Hmm!

<i>There's a free-floating
meteorological</i>

<i>weather containment
system overhead,</i>

<i>and the anemometer readings
are off the charts!</i>

ALL: What?

<i>We're all in grave danger.</i>

<i>In danger of having the time
of our lives!</i>

<i>Thank you, Kendra,
for that lovely introduction.</i>

You're making a big mistake!

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press,</i>

<i>and most importantly</i>

<i>influencers with over
10,000 followers,</i>

<i>we are gathered here today</i>

<i>for the grand opening

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>I took the tallest skyscraper
in Adventure City</i>

<i>and stuck a brand-new tower

Go get 'em, pups!

You know, Liberty,
I've been thinking.

You're kind of like an honorary
member of the PAW Patrol, right?

I suppose you could say that.

I mean, your words,
not mine.

But to be an official member,
you'd need a faster vehicle, right?


I know, I know,

my ride's a rusty old
wagon with a wonky wheel

that goes
"eee-ooo-eee-ooo-eee-ooo."

You don't have to rub it in.

There's no way

Mayor Humdinger?
Yes? How can I help you?

Ryder? What are you doing here?
(CATS HISSING)

This tower isn't safe.
We've got to get you out of here.

Oh, no, the power's out.
That means the elevator's dead.

We have to go now.

Nice try! I'm not going
anywhere with you.

Ah! Oh! Ahhh!

My top hat!

Okay, fine.
I'll go with you.


But I want to make it very
clear, this is not a rescue.

It's... Uh,
an "assisted exit."

You can call it
whatever you want,

as long as you get in the
elevator now!

I'll release the cables
manually from above.

Once I've lowered you down safely,
I'll rappel down the elevator shaft.

Hmpf. Show off.

Even though we've had our personal
differences over the years,

I take no pleasure
in doing this.

Doing what?

Ahhh!


Actually, that's
pretty satisfying.

One one thousand, two one thousand,
three one thousand, four one thousand,

five one thousand.

Oh, uh...

Nothing to worry about,
