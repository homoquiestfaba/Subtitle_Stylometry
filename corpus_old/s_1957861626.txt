We are <i>not </i>selling the brewery.

Not to you or anyone else.

[man on phone]Â <i>Wait, wait!</i>
Got it?

You shut that down, Delroy?

It's over, Wilma.

I told him more beer,Â less prisons.

Whoo!

Did real good here too!

I love that!

My library is set for the year.

[child belches and laughs]

[Wilma] Time to go, Kat.
Okay. [laughs]

Before you put Mr. Fawzi out of business.
[Kat] Daddy!

Kat, you need to swim like we taught you.

W-W-Wild, you're doin' it again!

Doing what, Wendell?
Stealin' the hair cream!

That's just a bad plug right there.
That's what that is.

Why'd you plant it?
It's not a bad plug.

You're depriving that plug
of its rightful nutrients.



Need I remind you?

It's your fault
Belzer put us in jail for treason!

And if he goes bald,

he'll skin us both alive!


I'm not worried, Wendell.
You're the one shootin' blanks.

[Wendell growls] Get... Get... Hey!
Oh!

{\an8}As your older brother,
I demand you regurgitate that cream!

Now, why would I do that? Wendellâ€¦

Fresh cream ain't gonna
revivify a bad plug.

Did you just admit
you've been stealing it?

Uh-huh.
Why?!

'Cause it tickles my tummy.

That's the dumbest thing I'veâ€¦

You okay, Kat?

What?

The bridge. You had a panic attack.

I'm fine, Ms. Hunter.



[voices speaking cheerfully]


When did it burn down?

It was at your parents' memorial.

What?

You were already
in the group home upstate.

You didn't need more bad news.

Was anyone hurt?

It was bad.

[melancholic music playing]

had a domino effect,</i>

Whoa! It's Dad's Cyclops!

[Ms. Hunter] Some other stuff too.

Rust Bank Catholic was the first school
to sign up for "Break the Cycle."

I promised you would behave.

This school's in trouble, isn't it?
You need that "Break the Cycle" money.

Ah, and youâ€¦ You need a fresh start.

Whoa.

Traitor.


Sorry I'm late.

Adaptable nature.

Ha!

Now, this spectacular creature
is calledÂ <i>Thaumoctopus mimicus,</i>

the mimic octopus.

Ah, okay.
You've never seen this before, right?

Never.

Uh, well, the mark proves
that you're special, Kat.

But it has to be our secret.

Huh?

[nun] That's how I can protect you.
Protect me from what?

That stupid octopus. It bit me, right?

It wasn't the octopus.
You're just protecting your job!

Tell no one, Kat!

So, what do we believe
just happened? Sweetie?

No, she's clearly telekinetic.
Her mind can move matter.

that Kay-Kay is an interrupter.

A disturber of the status quo.

Oh, come on, Siobhan, leave her alone.

It's none of your business, Ramona.

I'm sorry, RaÃºl. I keep forgetting.


Look at it.

Our faire is so much better
than Belzer's dump!

But you couldn't keep your mouth shut.

I know.

I was braggin' to the wrong demon.

Duh! When Belzer found out,

he called this an insurrection,
a rebellion!

Now, we're stuck here for life!

Guess we got what we deserve.

"We"?! You have not begun

Imagine! She could summon us
to the Land of the Living!

I mean, Belzer claims it's dangerous.

Dangerous? Wild, he never even been there.

Then that's where we'll build our faire!

What?! [laughs]

{\an8}That's amazing, Wild. You're right!
He would never know.

We have a new girl at RBC.

Full tuition!

Sweet Siobhan told Mummy all about her.

Now the state's paying <i>him</i>
to take in criminals.

That's our business model, Bests.
How dare you compete with Klax Korp!

[laughs nervously] Well, technically,
it's not competing if you have no prison.

[grumbles]
He's right, Lane.

We need our own council members
to win the vote.

Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.
They would vote for you!

Ooh! Where do we find them, Father?

In the finest mausoleums in the cemetery.


It's over, Bests.

We are no longer going to
prop you and your precious RBC up.

What am I supposed to do now?
I have a son to feed.

No! A son, remember?

Yes.

I'm still investigating the fire.

Look, Win, those workers were my friends,

my neighbors.

I... I know the Klaxons are dangerous.

But if I can link them to the fire,
we can stop the prison for good.

Didn't want to see
my parents' grave alone.

I see.

Well, we have a long, cold walk back.

[eerie music playing]

Eh, she'll show up at some point.

Meanwhileâ€¦

I say it's time to test the cream!

Look, a fresh-dug grave!

Time to eat dirt, Sparky!
[neighs]

[Sparky whirring]


[whines happily]


[Wild] Here we go.
[Wendell grunts]

Ooh, that is one
messed-up man of the cloth.

Sure, but if we can raise him up,
we can raise up anyone in the cemetery.

[grunts curiously]

[Wild] Wendell?
Mm-hmm?



Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

[Wild] It worked!
[Wendell] Whoo!

["Sexy Thing" by Hot Chocolate playing]
<i>â™ª I believe in miracles â™ª</i>

[coughs]
<i>- â™ª Where ya from? â™ª</i>

[Wendell] Who did it?
[Wild] We did it!

Dear God! I'm in Hell!

No way, Padre!

You're back
in good ol' Rust Bank, fully alive!

[chuckles nervously]

Thank you, Lord, for this miracle!

Not Him! We brought you back!

What?
Wendell and Wild!

You? But you're demons.

We are the Magician Morticians.

The <i>artistes</i> of the afterlife.

[Wild humming melodically]

[Wendell chuckles]
[Wild] Okay.

<i>â™ª How did you know I needed you so badly â™ª</i>

Andâ€¦

[Wendell and Wild] Ta-da!

Y-Y-Your work is remarkable!

Now, as far as payment goesâ€¦

Um, uh, I have to pay you?

How much?


Yeah, we're gonna build
the best bemusement park ever!

{\an8}- We're gonna call it the Dream Faire!
Huh?

And you, and all your neighbors
around here, gonna pay for it.

I... I... I need to show you something.

[Sparky] Huh?
[Father Bests] Come.

Thisâ€¦ is Rust Bank.

Take a look.

No jobs.

No banks.

No people.

Go ahead,

raise all the dead you want,

but there's no one here
to pay for this faire.

[both sobbing]

What's to stop us from puttin'
your janky ass back in the ground?

Yeah, your janky, stanky ass.

[dramatic music]
[whooshing]

He's right, Lane.

We need our own council members
to win the vote.

Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.

They would vote for you!


W-W-Wait! Wait.

I just had a vision.

Uh, uh, the Klaxons, uh, would
gladly payÂ for your services.

Enough to build our Dream Faire?
With all the trimmings?

Uh-huh. All that,
and enough to save my school.

[Sister Helley] Well, here we are, Kat.

Just tell me one thing before you go.

Is our secret safe?



I know what you are, Kat.
You're a Hell Maiden.

But how could you know that?

I'mâ€¦ kind of an expert.

And you do not want
certain partiesÂ finding out about you.

Why do you care about me?

I care because I was just like you.


You aren't stupid, Kat.
Stupid enough to get my parents killed!

Stupid enough to just watch 'em drown,

not even try to help!
Stupid enough to believe they could ever...

Stop! It couldn't have
all been your fault, Kat.

You're nothing like me!

[sad gentle music playing]

[sighs heavily]

{\an8}- [gasps]
[bleats]

We were so worried, Kay-Kay,
when you didn't get on the bus.

Where were you?
You gonna arrest me, Klax Korp?

Arrest you?
You <i>are</i> the prison people.

Why, yes, private prisons.

With trauma therapy,
full detox, and whole-being cleanses.

You ever been inside a private prison?

Well, no.

["Young, Gifted, Black, In Leather"

I didn't think so.

{\an8}Maybe it was just some students
messing with you.

Perhaps, I'm just more important

than your parents.

Oh, you creepy old dude!

Forgive me, Father,
but you wouldn't even be here without Kat.

How is that, exactly?

She's the one who summoned those demons...

[grunts] Shh!
Ow!

I have better things to do.

Bests' phone!


[Sister Helley] Father Bests, undead.

{\an8}- Hmm.
How's it possible, Manberg?

Remember your first demon, Helley?

You were just 12 when we captured it.

Yes, made me summon demons,

just so you could add them
to your stupid collection.

I made you my right foot of justice,
and you quit on me!

It had nothing to do with justice!

It was entrapment.

It was wrong.

[groans mildly, grunts]

[Manberg chuckles]

There's a new Hell Maiden
at RBC, isn't there?

She'sâ€¦ She's safe!

My bear would've told me she'd arrived,

given me time to train and protect her.

But you stole it from me.

And the new Hell Maiden
has stolen it from you.

I'll be waiting, Helley.

Hmm.

Oh!

Now, where are Kat and RaÃºl?


Kat!

RaÃºl!

It sounded just like him on the phone.

It couldn't have been.

We drowned him right here.

How?
[sighs]

The council votes tomorrow!

[snaps fingers] These are my partners,

Wendell and Wild.

[mellow cheerful music playing]

{\an8}Um, we raised Padre, here.

From the dead.

Now, they can raise
the old-guard members you need.

The ones rotting in the cemetery?

Sure! Have 'em all cleaned up,
ready to vote by morning.

[both laughing]
Yes!

Get those prison votes,

{\an8}and we'll make you rich.

{\an8}Rich enough to build our Dream Faire?

Certainly!

We'll pull the permits,
fast-track construction...

And Bob's your uncle!

[clears throat] What about my school?

Of course, Father.

RBC shall have
our full financial support now!

Mmm.

Those brewery workers are
in the same cemetery.

Gah!

By the way, do you plan to raise
anyone else from the dead?

Well, uh, our Hell Maiden's parents...

No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

If you raise anyone else in the cemetery...

It's no funfair, no RBC money!

What? Hey, wait a minute...
I promise!

Just your voters
will be raised. [chuckles]

Fine. Toodle-pip!



Exactly. All parked in a row.


[both laugh]


[Sparky whinnying nervously]
What's wrong, boy?



Where were you?


Stop! Stop it!

You promised my parents!

Ch... Wha... You weren't here!

Yeah, you weren't up in here.
So, we... we made Bests our guinea pig.

Uh-huh.
Check this out.

Ooh! What's that?

Oh, that's our secret sauce.

That stuff'll bring my parents back?

Yep.
Umâ€¦

Great! Let's go!

I killed you.

I... I don't have friends.

He's in danger, isn't he?
Maybe.

If he's in danger,
then we gotta go help him.

Friends are like family, Kat.

We do whatever we can for them.

We've finally won the vote!

Uhâ€¦

Mummy, Daddy,
I know the truth about your prisons.

And what is that, Siobhan?

Well, you make a pile of money
for every prisoner you take.

So you pack them in like sardines,
provide crap food, crap medical,

dangerous conditions,
and zero rehabilitation.


I am proud of you, dear.

That's our business model, exactly.

Don't some people deserve
a second chance? Like Kay-Kay?

Oh, we love those Break the Cycle kids.

Going to bus them in
by the hundreds to your school.

Then, we make it impossible
for them to succeed there.

And when they failâ€¦

Our new prison will be waiting
with open arms.

I... I have to feed Gabby.

I want my promise!

I'll be there, Mummy. I promise.

Huh?

So, any last words?

Huh. I thought you'd be taller.

I am taller.


What? Cartoon mallets?!

Padre!

Ah, yes. May the Lord look kindly on you

and give you everlasting peace.

[both growl]

[both chuckle]

[groans]
Ow!

All right, here it comes!
[parents] One, twoâ€¦

Boom!
[Wendell and Wild] Ow!

Kat was scarier when she was three.
[Wild whimpers]

And I'm way scarier now!

[Wild] Hell Maiden!
You're alive!

Let my parents go!

It's, um... [chuckles]
N-No can do, Hell Maiden. You seeâ€¦

Uh, you s... What...
You still got 800 tasks to complete.

That is right. So, as your masters,

we order you to turn around and, uhâ€¦

[both growl]

Pfft! You're trippin'!

I'm not your puppet anymore.

Dang right!

[cheerful ethereal choral music playing]

[both groan]

Spark Plug!
[Wendell] Help, Sparky!

You disappoint me, Father.



[Wendell moans]
[Wild shrieks]

[grunts]
[yelps]

Why'd you do it?

Uh, they... they...
They were just my size, and I...

Not the boots, my parents!

Why were you putting them in their graves?

P-Padre here said it was the only way.

To save our Dream Faire.

And it was the only way to save my school.

What?



[Siobhan] Hello?
[bleats]

[Manberg] What?
[Wendell] Who's she?

[tense music playing]

[demons snarl]

What's going on here, Kay-Kay?

Sister Helley and I are Hell Maidens.

And if you call me Kay-Kay one more time...

O-Of course, you are a Hell Maiden, Kat.

my parents don't want to save your school.

Huh?
Or build some funfair.

But they already paid us.
[Gabby bleats]

[bleats]
Ahhh!

Wh-Wh-What is this?

It's how they pay all Klax Korp personnel.
Worthless in the real world.

[Wendell and Wild sob]

I need to show you something.

[wind whistles faintly]

You were right, Kat, about my parents.

Private prisons.

We have to stop them.

[menacing music playing]



[bulldozers rumbling]


[Kat gasps] It's too late.

What... What do you mean?

There's not gonna be a Rust Bank anymore!

You saw the future.

[thunder rumbles]

["Cult of Personality"

What's going on?

[all gasp]
[Belzer] Fee-fi-fo-fum.

I smell the blood of two thieving bums!

[thunder rumbles]

Oh, this is better than the undead army!

Where's my hair cream?

You stole it!

Now he's gonna kill us!

Everyone, down to the hearse,
and don't draw attention!

[Wilma groans]
[Belzer] Wendell?

Wild?
[Kat grunts]

[Wendell whimpers]
I know you're up here!


I'm not going to hurt you.

[Belzer laughs menacingly]
[Wendell and Wild whimper]

My greatest prize ever!

[vacuum whirring]
[Belzer] What the?!

Who's messingâ€¦

[Wild] Come on!
Let's go!

There you are, my thieving mutts!

Scream Faire Daddy's gonna strumâ€¦

Yourâ€¦

[Sparky neighs]


Uh, no, you don't!


[Wendell and Wild cheering]

[Wild] Yeah, all right, man!
[Wendell] Yeah!

[ethereal choral music playing]

All right!

[Belzer grunts]

[both scream]
[Manberg yells]

[Siobhan screams]


[Father Bests screams]
[wagon crashes]

{\an8}[Wendell and Wild gasp and groan]

Why did you do it?

Wh-Wh-Wh-What, steal your cream?

Come to the Land of the Living?

Well, why wouldn't we?


My Scream Faire did not need
some radical new design!

Does now.

[Wild laughs]

Oh!

My creamâ€¦ It's all gone!

[growls]
[both whimper]



What we all try to do.

Every parent.

Not me.

There were others before you
that ran away.

We had siblings?

"Hell with them," I said.

"They'll be back,
tails between their legs."

But they never came home.


[clears throat] Demon Lord!

It's Buffalo Belzer.

Fine, Mr. Belzer.
I, Manberg the Merciless,

am a sworn enemy of demons,

but not of families.

Is that you, Belissa?

I have all your missing children.

Go on.

Let my friends go, and they're yours.

I accept, Manberg the Merciful.

"Merci-less"!

[Manberg mutters]


Look at you,Â Zostril!


Let me tell you,

uh, reports of my death
were greatly exaggeratedâ€¦ [babbles]


He dead again?

Gave him plenty of cream.

Dang, you raised him
from the dead with hair cream?

Wellâ€¦ yes.

Come on, boys, that stuff just don't last.

"Stuff don't last"?

[hairs thud]
[Belzer] Don't be long, sons.

Can't build a newÂ faire
without the designers.

You mean us?
We'll make you proud, Pop!

That's right!


"Stuff don't last"?
What about my parents?!

No, a-a-all that's required
is a... a fresh dose of cream.

Worked for Padre.

It's empty!

Squeeze it right, be enough for days.
Weeks!

Hmm. Now we have loved
every single second with you, baby,

but Rust Bank's in trouble.

What if that last bit
of magic could help save our town?

I already told you it's too late!

No, Kat, you <i>can </i>change that future.

Really?

My mother thinks the fire was on purpose.

Needs a witness to prove it.

RaÃºl, raise a dead brew worker.

Oh, a witness.

If you squeeze it right,
be enough for two.

Three witnesses!

Meanwhile, we're gonna protect
Rust Bank 'til he gets back.

That's it, Kat!

Everyone, ready to hold that line?

Let's do this!
[all cheer]

[Sister Helley] Oh, yeah!

[crows cawing]

[protestors chant] Down with Klax Korp!
Down with Klax Korp!

Down with Klax Korp!

Down with Klax Korp!

But Lane,
Siobhan promised Mummy she'd come!

We have to start, Irmgard.

No more Klax Korp!

No more Klax Korp!
[clears throat]

Good morning, voters!

Today, it's out with the old

and in withÂ the newest,
biggest construction project

in our state's history!

[protestors sigh and groan]

{\an8}Now, my partners in crime,
Lane and Irmgard Klaxon!

[protesters booing]
[laughs] Thank you. Thank you.

No need, thank you.

When your governor offered us
millions to build our prison here,

we fell in love with Rust Bank.

A love sorely tested by that lot!

[booing]
We blocked you every year!

Should I do the honors, Irmgard?

Don't mind if I do.
[megaphone feeds back]

Gentlemen, start your engines!

[engines start and rumble]
[zombies growl]

And it's ready, steady...

Wait! Look!

{\an8}[suspenseful music playing]


Dear God, Siobhan's been brainwashed!


Go! Go! Go! Crush them all!

Let's go!

That future ain't gonna happen!

[cheerful eerie music playing]

Hi, guys.

It's pretty late.
It's 3:30 in the morning.

And I just woke up
because I heard some noises next door,

in the room next door,
and you won't believe what... what I found.

Come with me.

[eerie music playing]

Soâ€¦

I'm going to open the door now.

Shh.

[door creaks]

Hello.

Hey, where are you hiding?

Come on.

Ah, here you are.

Hi, Kat. How are you?

What are you doing here?

Maybe she was getting bored
at the studio, alone.
