(loud rumbling)

(man yelling)

(door squeaking)

It's now been 32 hours
since a deadly cave in

at the Clear River Mine.

Rescue crews are working tirelessly

to find any remaining survivors.

Three bodies have been
recovered from the rubble,

and miraculously, one
miner has been rescued
without any serious injuries.

(high pitched whining noise)
There are still 11 miners unaccounted for.

(man screaming)

(loud rumbling)




(dramatic music playing)

(man sighs)



(man gasps)

(eerie music playing)

(loud bang reverberating)

(man gasping for air)

(man yells in pain)

(eerie music playing)

(man grunting)

(man yells in pain)


(man yells)

(bell tower chimes three times)

(dissonant humming pitch)
