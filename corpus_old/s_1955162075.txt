It's all right.

You fell asleep.

You know what stop was yours?

Is this your first time on here?

Well...

come on.

I gotta go in the town anyway
I'll take you in the truck.

Come on,
you're not in trouble.

So where we going,
do you know?

Are you new in school?

What's your name?

Rowan.

Huh?
Rowan.

Rowan, huh.

My name is Charlie.

And you supposed to be
on bus 19?

Rowan, bus 19.

Is your address on there?

I think I know where that is.

I believe
that makes you my last stop.

I go fill her up.

It's a lot of cheaper out here.

I'll be right back.

Is that all?

Sir?
Yeah.

How much for the candy bars?

Just returning your boy.

He fell asleep on the school bus.

Oh, go on then.

His first day worn him out.

I reckon.

I'll be bringing him home

everyday,
if he rides the bus.

It won't be for too long,
it shouldn't be at least.

Why is that?

Well this is a foster home.

They took him out this weekend,
some kind of emergency.

But they needed a place right away
and as I was on the list, so...

Huh.

They're already looking
for the next of kin.

They won't tell me 'what happened'.

But, they're looking to place him
pretty quick.

You got your things?

Yep.

Don't look like
anyone is home, does it?

Rowan,

have you ever been fishing?

Never?

Great day in the morning.

Every Tennessean man
needs to know how to fish.

You know what...

That fish and pole
are to do the trick.

My daughter accompanied me
back here when she was little.

Of course
that was a long time ago.

How old is she?

Well let see, she's...

well she's all grown up anyway.

Here.

Like this, see?

You see that button?

Hold that button down.

Pull back.

Just make sure,

let go of that button when you cast out.

You don't think she'll mind
I took you fishing, do you?

I don't think she care to often much.

I hope.

Do you wanna do it again sometime?

Sure.

Charlie!

Ow, there you go.

Look how your pole is bending,
he must be a big one, here.

And you got it.

Just keep the pole up.

There you go.
A little bit more.

A little bit more.

It's slipping!
No, no, just hold on, you got it.

Just, make it steady.

Hold it up.
Pulling in a little bit.

There you go.

A little bit more.
A little bit more!

Pull your pole back a little.

There you go.

Not too much, you break it.

Now,
let's see here.

Ow,

beautiful.

Hey, you did it!

Okay, pal.

Charlie...

Yah?
I see you tomorrow, right?

Yeah,
I don't see why not.

Rowan?!

The End
