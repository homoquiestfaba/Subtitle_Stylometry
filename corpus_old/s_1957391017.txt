MARIO Hi. Youâ€™ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

Please leave a message,

and weâ€™ll give you
a call right back.

My love...

Weâ€™re finally
getting out of this place,

just like I promised.

I sold it.

I sold it to him.

Yes.

I love you.

this thrill before...

MAN:
She would be so proud.

Always be a winner.

You want her to be proud
of you, donâ€™t you?

would take wing

would be through...

Youâ€™ve gotten old, bitch...

Letâ€™s go.

-

-Chole.
-WOMAN: Hi, Lupita.

-Hi, Helen.
-Morning.

-Good morning, Lupita.
-Hi, John.

Hola.

-Hey.
-You, too, huh?

Fucking hipsters.

-Oh!

-MAN: Babe, itâ€™s all right.

-Hello, Marcus.
-WOMAN: No, itâ€™s not all right!

Hey. How are you?

Â¿QuÃ© onda?

You need some help, granny?

You gonna be out here
showing weakness,

you better come on inside
â€™fore somebody sees you.

Mira, shut your cancer hole
and get me my coffee.

-

When are you gonna give up

working on this old thing,
Clarence, eh?

When it kills me-- thatâ€™s when.

This hereâ€™s the only thing
my daddy ever gave me.

-Mm-hmm.
-Told me, once we got her

up and running again,

sheâ€™d take us all the way
around the world and back.

And that is exactly
what I aim to do.

Youâ€™d be lucky to make it
out of Oak Springs, eh?

-Ah.
-

Where is Morrisâ€™s grumpy ass
this morning?

Still convinced he can
get Yolandaâ€™s dryer chair

up and running.

Son of a bitch donâ€™t know an
electrical wire from his dick.

Stubborn bastards,
the both of you.

-Stubborn?
-Yeah, yeah.

Now, I know you
ainâ€™t talking, granny.

Morris ainâ€™t
the only one missing

round here today, neither.

Good old fancy-pants Mario ainâ€™t
showed up for his oil change.

He loves that car of his
more than he loved his wife.

Sorry. I guess six months
is too soon to be making jokes?

Ah.

Donâ€™t worry about it.

-Ow! Damn it.
-Ay.

YOLANDA: Itâ€™s only the chair
thatâ€™s broken, Morris,

and I have so many problems
with my landlord already

without you fucking it up.

Yolanda, wait a minute. I just
got one more little thing.

-Iâ€™m telling you, itâ€™s gonna
be done. -

LUPITA: Youâ€™re gonna
mess it up even worse.

MORRIS:
There we go!

-

MORRIS:
Shit! Son of a...

Goddamn nearly shat myself.

Laugh it up, you gargoyle, you.

Go check on your greasy
boyfriend at the auto shop.

All right, Iâ€™ll see you ladies
tonight, then, huh?

Yolanda, Yolanda,
tomorrow morning,

Iâ€™m coming back
with the proper tools,

get this whole place
up and running. Youâ€™ll see.

Thank you, Morris, pero no.

-Iâ€™m going to get it done.
-Ay.

-

It still doesnâ€™t
feel right, Lupita.

Ay, por favor, Yolanda.

Going through so much
trouble just for me.

Weâ€™re the reason Mario can
afford to keep the doors open

at the community center.

-This is my problem, and...
Ay, no. Ay. -Look!

I know when your pendejo
landlord raised your rent

how much it hurt you,
and now this?

And thatâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business
but my own, Lupita.

I appreciate everything
you always do

for all of us around here,

but sometimes
I wish you could...

Ay, mira.

Did you see my new product?

Yeah. Uh-huh.

No Dolores again today.

Pobrecita Dolores.

Ever since they moved in,
Iâ€™ve been taking my walks alone.

RAQUEL: Then why the fuck
did you invite us

to stay, then, Dolores, huh?

Because worrying about
my grandson out on the street

keeps me awake at night--
thatâ€™s why.

-Caleb, letâ€™s go!
-Iâ€™m coming. Damn.

And all of the trouble
that he got into--

heâ€™s lucky that he didnâ€™t get
locked up in juvie.

But you know what, probably
wouldâ€™ve been better for him,

â€™cause he sure donâ€™t get
no discipline at home.

I said I was sorry.

I mean, itâ€™s not like anybody
got killed or anything.

DOLORES: Where are you going,
anyway? Out shopping?

Jesus, Raquel.

You havenâ€™t given me a nickel
since you been here,

and youâ€™re always out there
shopping and buying clothes

and shit you know damn well
you canâ€™t afford.

RAQUEL: Dolores, I cannot have
this fucking conversation!

Caleb, letâ€™s go!

Come on,
your momâ€™s calling you.

-

RAQUEL:
Come on!

-YOLANDA: Lupita?

-Hmm?
-Donâ€™t you think itâ€™s time

to let go of
the gangster bandana, hmm?

No, why?
I love my gangster bandana.

-YOLANDA: Oh.

Did you get rid of her?

What my son ever saw

in that pasty bitch,
I will never know.

-But the boy...

Raquel lets him do
whatever he wants.

She lets him get away
with everything.

My son wouldâ€™ve raised him
right, but that woman-- mm-mm.

Sounds just like
his daddy to me.

What?

What?

Weâ€™re supposed to pretend
your son was perfect?

Por favor, you remember
when him and Eric...

I did the best I could
under the circumstances,

and you know more
than anybody how...

I-I-Iâ€™m not going there
with you. Excuse me.

Okay, seÃ±oras,
seÃ±oras, seÃ±oras.

-Lupita, Lupita.
-Hmm?

-Play nice.
-

I should get to
the bingo hall anyway.

Dolores.

I love you.

-

I love you, too.

Get out of here.

YOLANDA:
Gracias, Lupita.

-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Lupita.

LUPITA:
"Big winner."

-

Â¿Ay, quÃ© es?

GuÃ¡cala.

Hi, Helen.

-Hello, darling.
-Hey. How you doing, Lupita?

ERIC: So, you see,
itâ€™s never too late.

Remember, no matter
how many times

youâ€™ve tried to change
and failed,

youâ€™re here now.

All right, letâ€™s close it up.

God, grant me the serenity

to accept the things
I cannot change,

the courage to change
the things I can

and the wisdom
to know the difference.

Thanks for coming.

You sound good up there, mijo.

Strong.

Convincing, gÃ¼ey.

Iâ€™m so glad youâ€™re
convinced, DoÃ±a Lupita.

You here to set up then?

Of course.

Are you joining us tonight?

You know bingo is not my thing.

Maybe in like 50 years
when Iâ€™m yâ€™allâ€™s age.

You fool.

Itâ€™s weird seeing you
without Ms. Dolores.

Sheâ€™s got family
to take care of.

Me, Iâ€™ve got Oak Springs.

Or whatâ€™s left of it.

Fucking tanning salons and
shitty coffee shops all over.

Well, as long as youâ€™re around,
Oak Springs will never die.

Shit, you are Oak Springs.

You and the rest
of them old fogies.

Come on, after what yâ€™all did,
you and Dolores are legends.

Oh. I got it.

Mario gave you
a copy of the keys?

Even with all those tattoos
on your neck?

Nah, these are his.

Found them hanging
from the front door.

You just found them?

Doesnâ€™t sound like him.

Did you talk to him, call him?

Nah, I figured Mario, with all
the shit he had to deal with...

Let me see your phone.

MARIO
Hi.

Youâ€™ve reached
Mario and Patricia.

Please leave a message,

and weâ€™ll give you a call
right back.

Could be he really wants
to be alone right now.

Know what Iâ€™m saying?

No.

Iâ€™m gonna get you
on that new dating app...

"Smooches for Old Scrooges."

Definitely need to
get you out more.

Take time to just kick back
and just relax for once.

Stop shopping
at consignment shops.

Get you an upgrade at one
of them new retails opening up.

You know what Iâ€™m saying?

LUPITA:
I-26.

-LUPITA: N-42!
-

N-42, two, two, two, two!

another, just let it go...

O-65, 65.

The next number...

is...

-You having a stroke, old lady?
-

-

D-7!

-Lucky seven!
-MORRIS: D-7.

MORRIS: Seven, seven.
I got that! Bingo!

-Bingo. Bingo right here!
-Bingo?

-Goddamn right.
-Right!

DOLORES: Okay, we got
a winner, everybody!

-Come on up, Morris, and claim
your prize! -Hey! All right.

-Check that.
-Hey.

You have won one free haircut.

And donâ€™t forget
what happened to Samson

when he let Delilah give him
a little trim.

Ooh...

Yolanda, Yolanda, stand up.
Stand up, please.

-Come on. Come on, come on,
come on. -Please, Yolanda.

-DOLORES: Come on, come on,
come on! -Come on.

Take a look around this room

at all your neighbors
who care about you.

Come on, give it up,
Oak Springs.

-Give it up. Hey!
-Go, go, go!

I have seen this woman
perform miracles.

Look how she transformed me.
I look good, donâ€™t I?

Give me a round of applause.

LUPITA:
Okay, okay, beautiful Dolores.

How much did we raise tonight?

DOLORES:
Drumroll, please!

$511 and...

...four cents.

Now, which one of yâ€™all
was donating pennies

with your cheap ass?

Morris?

Eh...

DOLORES:
Beautiful Princess Yolanda,

put your hands out.
Come on.

Come on. Donâ€™t be shy.

With love from Oak Springs.

Come on. We love you.

We take care
of each other here.

This is our home.

Oak Springs!

And we are working hard
to keep it, and we...

-DOLORES: The hell?

-Ay, Morris.
-What?

Itâ€™s not like Mario
not to pay his electric bill.

Okay, ladies, next time.

Letâ€™s go, Morris.
Grab the beer.

All right, people, gameâ€™s over.
Thanks for coming.

Step aside.

Iâ€™ll take care of it.

Mario gave you a copy?

-Please.

As if you wasnâ€™t
in his business enough.

Damn, gave me
a shitty copy anyway. Mm.

Oh. Nice ride.

It damn sure donâ€™t belong
to nobody around here.

Itâ€™s the same guy
I saw earlier.

Whose car is this?

And why is it here, hmm?

Probably one of them
rich hipster assholes.

-What about Mario?
-What about Mario?

Clarence told me
he didnâ€™t show up

for his car appointment
this morning.

His car appointment?

Yeah, yeah.

Should we call
the National Guard?

Eric said Marioâ€™s keys were just
hanging from the door earlier.

Lupita, the man is old,
in case you havenâ€™t noticed.

And the power,
the power going out.

Lupita, the man
just lost his wife

after years of watching the
cancer just eat away at her.

I canâ€™t imagine what something
like that does to your head,

so how about we just cut him
a little slack

about being forgetful, okay?

Letâ€™s stop by his house!

No, we are not
stopping by his house.

Itâ€™s been six months.

Letâ€™s leave him alone.

What if itâ€™s something else?

Lord, if youâ€™re listening,
thereâ€™s a crazy woman down here.

Dolores, I got that feeling.

And you know more than anybody
what that feeling means.

Yeah, I know what it means.

-A pain in my ass!

Donâ€™t touch that car!

Oh, God.

Lupita, itâ€™s late. Come on.

Letâ€™s go so we can get
some rest, for Godâ€™s sake.

And tomorrow,
if you havenâ€™t heard from him,

we do it your way.

You never let me
do fucking anything.

MARIO Hi. Youâ€™ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

Please leave a message,

and weâ€™ll give you a call
right back.

"Under new management."

Ay, Mario, what did you do?

Â¡Hijos de la chingada!

-LUPITA: Mario.

How could you sell it, Mario?

Mario!

Want to talk to me
about the bingo hall?

Eh?

I know youâ€™re in there!

Mario!

You cook now?

Good morning to you, too.

I just thought it would
be nice. Thatâ€™s all.

Well, youâ€™re burning the eggs.

Uh, no soda before break...

Oh, so itâ€™s on now.

-Ah.
-RAQUEL: All right.

Smells good, right?

Oh, and that coffee--

I got that good stuff from
that new place down the street.

None of that
store-bought bullshit.

-CALEB: Real good, Mom.
-Thank you.

DOLORES: Are there some
hidden cameras in here?

â€™Cause you can cut the BS and
tell me what this is all about.

I just wanted to do something
to show my appreciation...

our appreciation for you.

You want something.

Money.

Thatâ€™s it. Mm-hmm.

No, I know.

A job, right?
You got a new job.

That means we can
move back home now.

Mom, please tell me
that weâ€™re

-moving back home. -How you
gonna burn up my good bacon

and at the same time...?

CALEB: You said we would only
be here for a little while.

-DOLORES: Why donâ€™t you
take back... -Mom.

...some of those new clothes
that you bought?

-But no...
-

I already took the clothes
back, for your information.

I just leave the tags on,
and I take them back

-when Iâ€™m done with them, so...
-Raquel.

How about if
I take you shopping

and buy you some clothes that
you can cut the tag off of?

How about that, huh?

Iâ€™ll be fine.

And for the record, I bought
that coffee with my money.

Fuck this.

And for your information,
I prefer store-bought

to this liquid cat shit.

Posted on my door,
your door and everyone else.

Should I grab my shotgun?

You know I still keep it
in the kitchen.

"New management."

Still no word from Mario?

Stopped by this morning,
saw his car.

No answer.

I-If Marioâ€™s looking to sell,
we canâ€™t just...

Sell? No, hombre.
No, no, por favor.

Mario had a moment of weakness.

But we wonâ€™t let that happen,
will we?

Hell, Lupita, you knew Mario.

He was never happy here.

-And when Patricia died...
-MORRIS: Hey, hey. Whoa.

Oak Springs
has been good to us.

You have been good to us.

-But look, Lupita...
-But what? But what?

Weâ€™ve been struggling a long
time, granny. You know that.

We love this neighborhood.

But the people in this town have
been doing pretty goddamn good

selling their property
to these rich bastards.

And I donâ€™t know, but sometimes
it donâ€™t sound so bad.

Youâ€™d piss your chones if I told
you the offer I got on my house.

We all get the letters.

I donâ€™t blame Mario.

Shit, for the right price,

I could be laying on a beach
somewhere in a string bikini.

-YOLANDA: Lupita.

Donâ€™t you think
we deserve better?

Look, Iâ€™m a loyal man.
You all know that.

Even when things got hard,
I stayed.

I stayed out of loyalty to you,
Lupita. You understand?

But where did all that loyalty
get me? Where? What?

Nothing but pain. Thatâ€™s what.

Youâ€™re abandoning your home
for a little bit of money.

-No.
-DOLORES: Lupita.

None of us
are what we used to be.

But weâ€™re still here.

Little older, little crankier.

-But damn it...

...weâ€™re still here.

We are.

Where we have always been.

-SÃ­.
-

Whatâ€™s the plan, granny?

We show up tonight
and give this big asshole

a proper Oak Springs welcome.

-YOLANDA: Andale.

Looks like a goddamn casino.

Is it even possible
to do all this in one night?

Of course itâ€™s possible.

Shit, come on,
I couldâ€™ve done it in less.

Morris, you wouldâ€™ve burned
the building down to the ground.

Iâ€™d rather see a pile of ashes

than whatever the hell
Iâ€™m looking at now.

Letâ€™s go introduce ourselves
to this pinche gringo.

Now, now, now, now, w-w-wait.
We donâ€™t know heâ€™s white.

ALL:
Heâ€™s white.

-

Holy shit.

You can say that again.

-Oh, what?
-Oh...

YOLANDA: Can you imagine the
electricity bill for this place?

Hey!

For a bingo hall
in Oak Springs,

this is a bit of an overkill,

-if you ask me.
-Ay.

Hey, Lupita.

-Lupita.
Â¿QuÃ©?

Donâ€™t you think
we should play, too?

You know, to blend in?

We are not playing.

And to be honest,

all of these people should
be ashamed of themselves.

That was a good idea.

LUPITA: Itâ€™s not...
itâ€™s not a good idea.

Is that Raquel over there?

That bitch.

Stay focused.

-Sheâ€™s here trying to
get rich quick. -Come.

LUPITA:
Sit. Sit there.

Marioâ€™s been gone a day,
and all it takes

is some blinking lights
to make them forget.

Makes me sick.

MAN: Ladies and gentlemen
of Oak Springs...

Iâ€™ve got one question for you.

Are you feeling lucky?

Well, you can call me Mr. Big.

And it is an absolute pleasure

to welcome you all here
to the grand opening of...

...of Mr. Bigâ€™s Bingo!

LUPITA:
No.

Well, here at Mr. Bigâ€™s Bingo,
we have only big prizes.

Because everyone
deserves to be a winner.

I look around this
beautiful community of yours,

and you know what I see?

I see dreams.

Big-time dreams.

I see potential in Oak Springs,
all these unfulfilled desires.

And each and every one of you
has a big dream.

I mean, who doesnâ€™t?

Am I right?

No matter how happy,

no matter how content
you may be,

we all have that one thing,

that one little thing
that we still yearn for.

Like an eternal itch
you just canâ€™t scratch.

They say money
canâ€™t buy you happiness.

I disagree.

You know what kinds of people
believe this nonsense?

Losers.

-

MAN:
Losers?

Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

-CROWD: No! No!
-Losers!

MR. BIG:
No.

How about you, my dear?

Whatâ€™s the one thing
you most desire?

What would bring you happiness?

A new life.

A new life, hmm?

Well, here at Mr. Bigâ€™s Bingo,
you could win enough money

to buy that new life
ten times over.

Whoâ€™s ready to play the game?

MAN:
Hey! Hey!

-Oh, shit.

MAN: Yeah, you better run,
little shit.

B-14.

G-46.

G-51.

RAQUEL:
Bing... Wait.

Bingo. Bingo! Bingo!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I have bingo!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God! -You want it bad
enough, ladies and gentlemen,

the luck will find you.

Well, come on up, big winner.

-Letâ€™s see what you won.
-Oh, God.

Holy shit.

ANNOUNCER:
$10,000.

Holy shit!

I knew we shouldâ€™ve played.

I told you it was a good idea.

-Oh, my God.

MR. BIG:
Come back tomorrow night.

Come back every night, where
the prizes will be even bigger.

Or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

RAQUEL:
Yes! Fuck yes!

And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

-CALEB: Mom?
-

Mom?

Can we talk about yesterday?

I didnâ€™t mean...

Iâ€™m sorry. I didnâ€™t...

Mom.

Mom! Mom, no!

Mom, no!

Caleb, whatâ€™s going on?

Whereâ€™s your mom?

No, you didnâ€™t.

RAQUEL:
A new life.

That pasty bitch.

by the dozens

new cousins

than money buys

-Look at me!

in balance

she donâ€™t try

than money can buy

-

thereâ€™s a wrinkle

thereâ€™s a twinkle

-

than money can buy

Rich, bitch!

Sheâ€™s got
smarts that you donâ€™t see...

RAQUEL: You look just like
your fucking grandma

when you look at me
like that.

-Like Iâ€™m a loser.
-CALEB: I never said that.

RAQUEL:
You think your mom is a loser?

You donâ€™t think I can make it
without your dad?

I donâ€™t know
if I have what it takes

to be a mother
without your dad.

-I went from being Raquel...
-

to being Calebâ€™s mom.

She had to give up
all her hopes and dreams

for her kid just like that.

If I ever wanted anything
for myself...

I just want to remember
what itâ€™s like to be me.

Oh, I would be
a really shitty mom.

I would be a selfish,
cold-hearted fucking bitch.

MR. BIG:
All the desperate souls...

-we feed off them.
-

Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

MR. BIG:
Oh, thatâ€™s it.

-Thatâ€™s it.
-

Always be a winner.

How do you know for sure
she left?

She left me a shiny nickel.

Now, thatâ€™s what she does.

She left my son
I donâ€™t know how many times,

running off doing God knows
what with a baby at home.

I canâ€™t stop thinking
about last night-- that man.

That nasty smile of his,
that...

Oh, please, Lupita.

Donâ€™t start all of that
again, okay?

And that prize?

You ever seen a bingo game
with a prize like that?

No. Iâ€™ve lived in Oak Springs
most of my life, remember?

Oak Springs
seems like the last place

to open a big-money
bingo hall.

Well, Oak Springs is changing,
so maybe itâ€™s perfect for all

those new tech companies
moving in.

Ese hombre is a snake.

Those flyers were meant for us.

We need to find Mario!

-No.
-Maybe he knows something.

Lupita.

What are you doing, Dolores?
Get up.

Vamonos. Ã“rale.

I donâ€™t have the time
or the energy

to be playing Batman and Robin
with your behind.

Those days are long gone.

Iâ€™ll handle this shit myself.

Please donâ€™t do nothing crazy.

I donâ€™t give a fuck...

Mario?

Mario?

Mario?

Mario.

Mario.

What is this?

What happened to you, Mario?

-

Caleb?

Iâ€™m stopping by Miss Lupitaâ€™s.

Make sure she didnâ€™t
do nothing stupid.

DOLORES Okay?

All right, now,
I wonâ€™t be long.

Iâ€™m leaving my cell phone on
the counter in case you need it.

I want to tell you

got problems

some are poor

are for real

Welcome to the game, gentlemen.

some dues to pay

-Now, whoâ€™s ready to win big?
-

your very dying day

-

Ay, Dios.

Ay, Dios mÃ­o.

-

MR. BIG:
You...

...lose.

-Aah! Whoa.

-I come in peace, woman.
-Come in. Come in.

Have you been resting?

â€™Cause I know how you get when
you havenâ€™t had your siesta.

Itâ€™s not... Itâ€™s not...

I swear to God I just...

in the hallway...

Hey, hey. Take a breath.

Let that brain of yours rest
for one evening.

Lupita, what?

If youâ€™re out
hitting up cars again,

youâ€™re in the wrong part
of town, little homey.

Look, man,
I didnâ€™t take nothing...

Find something good in there?

Not here to fuck with you...
Caleb.

I knew your pops
back in the day.

We used to get into
all kinds of trouble together.

-You knew my dad?

He was like a brother to me.

When I heard what happened
to him, I felt that shit.

Sorry you had to
go through that.

I grew up without parents, too.

I had to make my own family.

Other kids as screwed up as me.

Not your pops.

Iâ€™m talking about real fuckups.

Dealing just to get by.

Started using after a while.

Whereâ€™s your friends now?

Dead.

As long as I had my high and
my money, I was good with it.

It was like an infection.

Ainâ€™t no cure for that shit.

Well, you got clean,
didnâ€™t you?

Getting clean ainâ€™t the same
thing as getting cured.

That taste...
that taste is permanent.

Every morning, I feel the urge,

and every morning, I got to make
the choice to ignore that shit.

Well, if you got better,
why do you still live here?

-Whatâ€™s wrong with Oak Springs?
-It sucks here.

Thereâ€™s, like, nothing
but a bunch of old people.

Except for you,

-and youâ€™re still kind of old.
-

Thatâ€™s â€™cause most
everybody else gone already.

Those old people are the closest
thing to a family I ever had.

Lupitaâ€™s been
like a mother to me.

That mean old Mexican lady?

Yeah, that mean
old Mexican lady.

Man, Lupita cleaned up
this whole neighborhood,

helped kids like me
get our shit together.

And not just Lupita.

-Your grandma, too.
Yeah, right.

Those ladies were like
superheroes around here,

for real.

Ran those damn gangs
out of here like that.

They built it up from nothing.

Thatâ€™s why Lupitaâ€™s
so protective

of the neighborhood, you know?

Last night,

I heard my grandma talking

about how my mom won big
at this new bingo place.

And this morning, she was gone.

If only I could get some money.

I donâ€™t know.

Sheâ€™s gonna come back for me.

I hope youâ€™re right,
little homey.

I hope youâ€™re right.

B-13!

CLARENCE:
Bingo!

Bingo! Bingo!

Bingo!

-Son of a bitch!
-Come on, Oak Springs.

Letâ€™s hear it for
the big winner of the night.

Itâ€™s all on me, baby.
Itâ€™s all on me.

-ANNOUNCER: $100,000.
-MR. BIG: Big winner.

Holy shit.

Cocksucker.

Will you please say something?

What can I say?

I want you to say
you will help me stop him.

What if he did something
to Raquel to make her leave?

How do we know he didnâ€™t
take her out already

like he did Mario?

Take her out?

-Yes.
-You are losing your mind.

Dolores, you didnâ€™t
see the way Mario was.

There was money.

There was green slime.

It wasnâ€™t natural. It was evil.

-And...
-Okay, okay.

What did the cops
have to say about it?

Oh, please.

Since when have we trusted
anything the cops have to say?

They donâ€™t care.

And they donâ€™t know Mario
like I do.

Mario hated his life
in Oak Springs

even before Patricia died.

You were just too stubborn
to accept it.

What if he felt stuck,

with no way out?

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

Donâ€™t even say it.

Maybe he just got tired
of fighting a battle

he knew
that he had already lost.

And heâ€™s not the only one
who feels that way.

When my son got sick...

Iâ€™m not doing this.

Whew.

Where are you going?

To be with my grandson.

Heâ€™s what matters most now.

Oak Springs is all I have.

Heâ€™s taking over,
and we have to do something.

This is our goddamn neighbor...

I am talking about my grandson.

To hell with this neighborhood!

I have fought with you
almost my whole life.

We all have.

And what do we have
to show for it?

Nada.

No money, no family, no future.

But we got Oak Springs, right?

And because of you...

...weâ€™re probably all
going to die right here

in good old Oak Springs.

Donâ€™t make me
fight this alone, please.

The fight is over.

RAQUEL: Calebâ€™s
your problem now, Dolores.

-Mom, Mom... Stop.
-

-Iâ€™m rich, bitch.
-Stop, Mom. Stop. Stop. Stop.

Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

in New Orleans

Mmm, mmm.

of many poor girls

Iâ€™m one...

Me and you...

gonna take a ride across this
whole goddamn world together!

Just like my daddy said.

Leave all the bullshit behind.

-

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about!

-

-

MR. BIG:
No matter how happy,

no matter how content
you may be...

Almost perfect.

to New Orleans...

MR. BIG: ...weâ€™ve all
got that one little thing

we still yearn for.

Stubborn bastards.

Youâ€™d be lucky to get out
of Oak Springs alive.

-

One more little tweak...

-...and weâ€™ll be ready to ride.

-

Yolanda! Yolanda!

Chingada madre.

-Chingado...

Clarence!

Are you in there?

Clarence!

Chingado.

-

-

-

-

-Caleb.

Caleb!

Come help me.
The lightâ€™s out again.

MR. BIG: And everyone
deserves to be a winner.

Dolores! Caleb!

No, no, no, no!

-Eric, es Lupita.
-ERIC: Hello?

I need your help,
mijo, pero ahorita.

Hello? Hello?

Lupita?

Lupita, tell me where you are.

Iâ€™ll come get you.

Hello? Lupita!

No more games.

-ERIC: Oye, Lupita.
Â¿QuÃ©?

Iâ€™m with you all the way.

Eric, be careful, mijo.

We are all thatâ€™s left.

Ya vete, cabrÃ³n.

Youâ€™re going to make me cry.

Okay, Iâ€™ll go around back.

Chingada madre.

What the hell
are you doing here? No.

No, donâ€™t get in there,
Caleb! No!

-

MR. BIG: Come back every night,

where the prizes
will be even bigger,

or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

Loser!

Caleb! Caleb.

Caleb!

-Fuck you.
-Come on, Caleb.

-Itâ€™s too late.
-Come on.

I made my decision.

Oh, youâ€™re hard now, huh?

Well, go ahead, big man.

Go ahead.

You gonna use that thing
or what?

Stop!

You donâ€™t know me
or anything about my family.

You donâ€™t understand.

I have to do this.

-With this money, I can...
-You can what?

Buy your mama back?

Money ainâ€™t real, man.

It canâ€™t solve your problems.

Trust me.

This shit...

this shit ainâ€™t the answer.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Itâ€™s all right, Caleb.

Caleb!

Morris.

I wonâ€™t let him have you.

You donâ€™t matter.

Canâ€™t you see that?

Youâ€™re nothing.

All you are is in the way.

Iâ€™m going to be a winner.

I donâ€™t need you.

Yolanda.

Yolanda.

ERIC:
Caleb!

Easy.

Easy, man.

Let him go!
Leave him alone, man! Wait.

What the fuck do you want?

Itâ€™s what you want
that matters.

You feel it every morning,

and every morning,
you deny yourself.

Donâ€™t deny yourself, Eric.

Thatâ€™s it.

Thatâ€™s it.

I wonâ€™t deny myself.

Eric, no! No!

Eric, no!

No!

Iâ€™m sorry.

Winners only.

Always be a winner.

Wouldnâ€™t want to end up like
your mother, now, would you?

Although she did smile
right up until the very end.

You were right, Dolores.

I let this happen.

But itâ€™s not too late.

We may be older, but we still
have plenty of life to live.

You hear me?

Oak Springs, listen up.

When our neighbors
started leaving Oak Springs...

...I called them
cowards and traitors.

But I was wrong.

I thought that a neighborhood

and a community
were the same thing.

A neighborhood is just a place.

Oak Springs is more than that.

We are Oak Springs.

Us, the people.

And when Oak Springs
works together,

there is not a pinche thing
in this world

that can defeat us!

Ladies and gentlemen...

...and special guests...

...welcome to Mr. Bigâ€™s Bingoâ€™s

Million Dollar Game.

Now, which one of you deserves
to be a millionaire?

No!

Donâ€™t listen to him!
Donâ€™t listen to him!

Oh, canâ€™t you see, Lupita?

Iâ€™m just the same as you.

Youâ€™re nothing like me.

Oh? Is that so?

Surrounding ourselves
with desperate souls.

Fixing the game
so they need us.

So, they canâ€™t live without us.

Caging them in.

And then we feed off â€™em

again and again and again

-and again and again and again!
-

We use promises
like leashes, huh?

Oh, keep â€™em close, Lupita.

Keep â€™em close. Keep â€™em close.

Ah. Huh.

Now...

Itâ€™s game time!

G-59!

Oh, B-11!

CALEB:
Hey, fuck head.

Shit!

Oh, fuck.

-Wake up. Wake up, please.
-

Come on, old lady. Wake up.

Wake up, please.

Lupita, please, wake up.

MORRIS:
Yolanda!

Yolanda. Yolanda.

Lupita, please, wake up.

Come on, lady, wake up.

-

You picked the wrong community,
motherfucker!

Fucker. Youâ€™re mine.

-

Piece of shit!

Â¡Dale!

Â¡Hijo de puta!

MORRIS:
Get him!

Damn.

MORRIS:
Kick that motherfucker!

Hit the motherfucker! Yeah!

Get the fuck out of our house!

-Son of a bitch!
-

-MORRIS: Fucker!
-DOLORES: Whoâ€™s your mama now?

MORRIS: Welcome to Oak Springs,
motherfucker!

-DOLORES: Mr. Big Stuff.

MORRIS:
Motherfucker!

Try me! Try me!

Get up! Get up!

You think you can beat me?

Oh, no.

The house always wins.

I agree with that.

Welcome to our house, Â¡puto!

-

-

No, no, no, no.
No, not the... not the money.

MR. BIG:
Oh, no. No, no.

-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-

-Caleb!

Yolanda. Yolanda.

Lupita.

Game over.

MORRIS:
Whereâ€™s Clarence?

Clarence!

MR. BIG
The money.

Money.

Clarence, Clarence, did he...?

No.

Clarence.

YOLANDA:
So...

What now?

Iâ€™m sorry I kept you
all here for so long.

I was too stubborn
to accept the truth,

and I should have
listened to you.

This place was never our home.

You are my home, my family.

It took all this
for me to see that.

And now...

And now what?

Weâ€™re not dead yet, woman.

Does that mean
weâ€™re leaving Oak Springs?

Iâ€™m just saying. I...

We are Oak Springs, mijo.

And so are you.

So, can Oak Springs go
someplace by the beach, then?

As long as weâ€™re together...

...it doesnâ€™t matter
where we go.

-

that I dreamed for

in lifeâ€™s game

and my loved ones

yeah, Iâ€™ll leave
