Crocodiles hail from the great age of
reptiles over 70 million years ago.

Since then, the world
has changed dramatically...

but amazingly,
they have changed little.

They're the only
great reptile predator...

to have outlived the dinosaurs.

Ancient they may be
but 70 million years on...

they're still the most successful
freshwater predator.

Most of the waterways in
the tropics these days...

have their own species
of crocodile.

How come they've been
so successful for so long?

It seems their design when it first
appeared was already very advanced...

and it's kept them
successful ever since.

This film reveals the
nature of that success.

Crocodiles may have scored
an early evolutionary bull's eye...

but there's much more to their
staying power than brute strength.

Only now, by exploring
their complete world...

above and below water,
by day and night...

can we fully appreciate
just how sophisticated they are.

Underwater, crocodiles
have perfect poise.

They can control their
buoyancy like a submarine.

To dive, they breathe out
which reduces their lung volume.

They can sink without trace.

While submerged a protective
membrane closes over their eyes...

like swimming goggles.

Crocodiles are cold-blooded.

They rely on the temperature
of sun and water...

to heat themselves up
or to cool down.

But when fully charged...

they are capable of
breath-taking power and speed.

They're the most dangerous
freshwater predator on the planet.

Even Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't
match this winning formula.

It's a design that has allowed them
to spread around the tropical world.

This extended family includes
alligators of temperate waterways...

Gharials of the Indian
subcontinent...

and caiman of tropical
South America.

They've even invaded the sea.

Crocodiles have special glands which
enable them to tolerate saltwater.

This is how they've colonised
new rivers along the coast.

But only a few species
can migrate across oceans.

The real specialists,
the saltwater crocodiles...

are affectionately known
as "salties".

They've been seen
1000 kilometres from land...

encrusted with barnacles, as they
search for new island homes.

This pioneering spirit and
their unique character...

has made them a universal threat.

Crocodiles deserve their
tough reputation...

but they aren't just
solitary killers.

In the calm of the Florida swamps we
can begin to see them in a new light.

They are reptiles
with social skills...

and American alligators
are particularly chatty.

During the breeding season...

an expressive chorus of
bellows, grunts and hisses...

rises from their densely
vegetated swamps.

The males are calling
to distant females...

but their bellows
sometimes attract rivals.

There are snappy ways to
make your feelings known...

if you end up
in the wrong company.

The resident male only shows
a bit of muscle...

if the rival fails to
get the message.

He's made his point and he can
now focus on finding a mate.

Vibrations within
his muscle walls...

send sound waves
rippling out in to the swamp...

powerful enough to
make the water dance.

Part of his roar radiates
at such low frequency...

that human ears can't hear it.

But these subsonic calls
have astounding penetration...

travelling four times faster
and further under the water.

Only with special low frequency
recordings...

can we appreciate what
the female alligator hears.

She finds his romantic
rumblings irresistible.

Even though the call may come from
the remotest parts of the swamp...

she is soon on his wave length.

Then they have a more
intimate conversation...

conducted in body language.

Their relationship is sealed,
touchingly.

Crocodiles are extremely
sensitive to touch.

Their armour-plated toughness
would appear to be only skin-deep.

Such complicated language
and behaviour...

is exceptional among
today's reptiles...

but crocodiles might provide
a tantalising rear window...

on the social life of their
ancient relatives, the dinosaurs.

Nile Crocodiles are the most
fraternal crocs of all.

Once a year,
they hang out together...

soaking up the sun
at traditional mating places.

These are far from being
lazy afternoons.

The group is very organised...

so individuals keep a careful eye
on movements within it.

An adult male, over five metres long,
is the centre of attention.

Up to ten females spend much of their
time in the water soliciting him.

They bear their throats
as a gesture of appeasement.

Body signals are also
used by the male.

He shows-off with noisy
water displays.

These postures enhance
his attractiveness to females.

It is they who often
take the lead...

by rubbing themselves
along the length of his body.

At first he snubs both of them.

But the rubbing releases a pungent
oil from glands under their jaws.

Both sexes are highly sensitive
to this crocodile perfume...

and the male answers
with his own musky message.

The scent in the water is
particularly potent prior to mating.

Several weeks later, the females
are ready to make their nests.

Even when basking, adults
rarely move far from the water.

It's ironic that the first
critical part of crocodilian life...

is spent on land.

Crocodile babies are born encased in
eggs but they must still breathe air.

It's essential this mother lays her
clutch beyond the high water mark.

The eggs will be so at risk...

from drowning, predators and
temperature fluctuations...

that she relies on exactly the
same nest position year after year.

These time-honoured sites are a
measure of the experienced care...

that crocodile mothers provide.

Once the excavation is complete she
lays her eggs in a trance-like state.

She's entering a deep
commitment to her offspring.

The hole will become
an incubator.

Crocodile eggs will only develop...

if they remain between a
steamy 27 and 34 degrees...

so her choice of site is critical.

Nest chambers from equatorial African
plains to Himalayan river valleys...

all remain within
this temperature range...

but no-one knows how
crocodile mothers get it right.

Once the nest is sealed,
the mothers keep vigil for 90 days.

Temperature determines
the sex of the developing eggs.

A half degree difference between
the top and bottom of the nest...

can markedly affect
the ratio of males to females.

Given the changes in climate
that the world has experienced...

it seems incredible that crocodiles
have survived at all.

Overall, enough males
and females emerge...

but these baby Nile crocs face more
immediate threats to existence.

Raiders might be drawn to
their combined noise and smell.

Hopefully their mother will hear
their calls and reach the nest first.

Once she digs them out...

they must reach the relative security
of water as quickly as possible.

The babies could probably
find their own way...

but they are only safe
if they stick together.

So their mother transports them
to water herself. In her mouth.

The skin of her lower jaw stretches
into a hanging cradle...

in which she can carry
fifteen or so at a time.

It's a snug fit, once you're in.

Her forty-or-so eggs
hatch simultaneously...

so she'll have to make
several trips.

The clamourings of
the hatchlings...

constantly remind her
to return to the nest...

and ensure that no-one
misses the last bus.

She releases them into
a nursery pool.

They must make the most
of her tender loving care.

They have only a few weeks
under her watchful eye.

For safety's sake, they call
to each other and to her...

conversations which
continue into adulthood.

The 18 different sounds
they'll use...

represent a vocabulary more typical
of mammals than of reptiles.

Unlike mammals, their rate of growth
is affected by temperature.

The warmer it is, the quicker
the food digests into body bulk.

Over a lifetime
under a tropical sun...

they may grow 4000 times
bigger than this.

Their mother won't eat at all.

She's protecting her infants
from being eaten...

even by other crocodiles.

The mother successfully
defends her own brood...

but it's a grim reminder that
crocodiles eat just about anything.

Her babies will learn that
successful crocodiles...

take all their dietary chances.

Their hunting technique
is there from birth.

With eyes, ears, and nose
at water level...

they mirror the tactics
they'll use as adults.

These shoreline snacks...

may be wildebeest or
zebra in years to come.

They rely on communal living
to survive this tender age...

but competition between
the youngsters is intense.

Despite their mother's protection,
only two percent will survive.

The babies of caiman, a type
of South American crocodile...

face even shorter odds.

Wildlife may seem abundant
in their Venezuelan marsh...

but that's because the water
elsewhere is drying up.

Even the fish are out of water.

The dry season is
five months long...

but in some years
it's more severe than usual.

Unexpectedly, animals can
be left high, if not exactly dry.

Eventually some of these watercourses
will dry up completely...

leaving many caiman
exposed and dehydrated.

Temporary skin relief is provided
by this ultimate of face packs.

Mud is an effective
crocodilian sun screen.

Cooling water is at a premium.

The remaining pools
are becoming overcrowded.

At such pressing times the
adults usually rub along.

However, babies could
be eaten by them...

so this is no place for
a mother to raise her young.

Fortunately they can expect
complete maternal attention...

during this five month
period of danger.

The shrinking watercourse becomes
hazardous for the babies.

Drastic measures are called for.

Night-time cameras reveal
they'll make a run for it...

under the cover of dark.

Their escape will be risky,
for it is made over land.

Mother leads the way.

It's a while before the babies
have the courage to join her.

Calls of reassurance and
maybe her musky smell...

encourage the hatchlings
out of the water.

She follows good instincts.

Night-time temperatures are safer
for tiny cold-blooded bodies...

and there are fewer threats about.

But this is a long march that
must be concluded by daybreak.

Their mother's acute
sense of smell...

brings them to their watery
destination...

with less than an hour to spare.

There's plenty of water
for her babies...

to survive the rest
of the dry season.

But lots of other females
have had the same idea...

and there's only room
for one adult.

The mothers must fight, or as is more
often the case, simply leave.

Their offspring are
far from abandoned.

The remaining female will
adopt and protect them all...

over one hundred of them.

This super-mum
carries her burden lightly.

Family life may be unconventional but
crocodiles do grow up in company.

As hunting adults, this may prepare
them for dedicated teamwork.

Especially if there's
a rare dish on the menu.

Migrating zebra cross
the Mara River in Kenya...

on only a few occasions
each year.

Resident Nile Crocodiles can't afford
to miss these fleeting chances.

So they co-operate.

From different places
under the banks...

they spend days waiting
and watching the nervous herds.

Only when the zebra commit
themselves to a departure point...

do the crocodiles take up
their final positions.

The current drags the
zebra downstream...

so five or six crocodiles cover
the crossing from different angles.

It's hard work for crocodiles too,
but they can submerge...

taking advantage of deeper,
slower currents, to move closer.

Their approach is stealthy,
measured and tactical...

as if moving in
on a chosen victim.

The current is flowing
in the zebra's favour.

It buffets the crocodiles out of
position and they can't get a grip.

The zebra's wide rump
gives it a big advantage.

Adult zebras also have a vicious kick
which could break a crocodile's jaw.

That might mean starvation,
so crocodiles are also taking risks.

A lot of effort results in
little success for the crocodiles.

But only until smaller, more
vulnerable animals enter the water.

At any time the zebras can be
ambushed by frightening power...

and lightening speed.

The baby zebra faces
several waves of attack.

This is the advantage of teamwork.

Most of the year, life along Africa's
rivers is even more of a struggle.

The dry season in Zambia's
Luangwa Valley can be unsparing.

Even vegetarians
are forced to scavenge.

But crocodiles still thrive
on the edge.

Far from being dependent on large
mammals like wildebeest or zebra...

crocodiles have extraordinarily
adaptable diets.

We've not known this until now...

because we've never seen
them hunting at night.

What crocodiles do at night
has remained a mystery...

because they will only move
around naturally in total darkness.

So only with the use of
invisible infrared light...

can we see their nocturnal habits
for the first time.

In the Luangwa River shallows...

a Nile crocodile hunts for less
glamorous prey. It's stalking fish.

Over the year, crocodiles fatten-up
on fish and molluscs...

rather than mammals.

Mammals come and go,
but the muddy river bottom...

is always a good place
to stir up snails, for instance.

The crocodile is a flexible feeder
in its methods too.

It uses its armour plated body...

as sinuously as a length of fishing
net to corral fish towards the shore.

Within their element, crocodiles
equally deserve the title:

"King of the beasts".

Only when the dry season
becomes desperate...

are these two great hunters
of land and water...

likely to come face to face.

But only the crocodile is bold enough
to leave the safety of water...

and meet the lion
on its home ground.

Few animals would actively
take on a whole pride.

The lions are simply frustrated.

Especially when the smell
of their supper...

coaxes other crocodiles
out of the water.

Crocodiles have thick skins.

The lions are forced to defend their
meal by moving to a different table.

They just leave nothing
but scraps behind.

The reptiles have stronger
stomachs than the mammals.

Lions can only cope
with the chewy parts.

Crocodile digestive juices
are so acidic...

that they can break down skin, bone
and horn, to be turned into muscle.

There's no such thing
as crocodile left-overs.

Their exceptional sense of smell...

enables them to capitalise quickly
on the demise of others.

And at the end of the dry season
the smell of death is everywhere.

A mother hippo mourns her baby.

Crocodiles have good reason
to be wary of adult hippos...

so they wait for the
grieving mother to go.

Food, any food,
is hard to find.

Crocodiles from up to 7 km away
recognise the whiff of opportunity.

One dead hippo attracts
over 100 hungry crocodiles.

But there's no feeding frenzy.
This is crocodile queuing.

The reason for this
patient approach?

Crocodiles have a powerful grip
and sharp teeth...

but their jaws don't move sideways.
They can't chew.

So they have to eat large
animals together.

One or two crocodiles effectively
brace the carcass in their jaws...

while others wrench off
smaller pieces of flesh...

by spinning their bodies round.

Everyone waits their turn.

With such tolerant
table manners...

it might take 24 hours to satisfy
the whole queue of diners.

Too readily, perhaps, we have cast
crocodiles as ruthless predators...

when they are also well-mannered,
adaptable creatures.

And too readily we have
called them primitive...

when our own human design...

has yet to stand up to
their successful test of time.

In evolutionary terms, the crocodile
has every reason to smile.
