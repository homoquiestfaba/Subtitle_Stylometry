It's great, because of its location.

11 
Yes, but only has one. 

12 
It's a big change.

57 
Okay. 
We should not do anything? 

58 
No way. 
Let's take our coffee. Voila! 

59 
And if you have a child? 

60 
Then you are making pancakes. 
-Paul! 

61 
One of the advantages of big city 
is that we need not get us. 

62 
Mainly when there 
nothing to worry about. 

63 
Are you using tie! 

64 
Yes. The chancellor wants 
go meet the Faculty.

Is it true? 

70 
You will have to get me out of

84 
Yes. Could you help? 
I'm trying 
find my office. 

85 
I got this plane, but ... 

86 
No offense. 
We do this trick at all. 

87 
It's room 1516. 
It's around here. I'll show you. 

88 
I am Simon Valencia. 

89 
I miss his presentation 
this morning. 

90 
Actually, nobody told me

91 
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you now. 

92

Morphology and Folklore. 

94 
All "locologias." 

95 
Yes! You are very funny. 

96 
You will take the class 
Astronomy too? 

97 
You think it should? 
Maybe even help me with my thesis ... 

98 
... Astrological Methodologies 
Contemporary. 

99 
After all, astronomers and astrologers 
trying to do the same thing. 

100 
You think so? 
"Sure. 

101 
Watching the stars 
and try to understand God's face.

105 
Thank you, Professor Paul. 
The pleasure was mine. 

106 
You should not go to your class? 

107 
I am student. 
I am an assistant professor. 

108 
I teach these "locologias." 
We will share this office. 

109 
The Department of Anthropology 
had no more space ... 

110 
... then I spent here. 

111 
Professor Paul, which seemed 
carpooling too? 

112 
Permission! 

113 
I saw that! 

114 
Do not just follow me in the street 
now haunts me in my house! 

115 
Come on, Miss Carver! 
She is not stalking. 

116 
I do not remember having directed 
word, Mr. Tyler. 

117 
At his age, no doubt. 
I have only 32! 

118 
Maybe counted in dog years. 

119 
Sorry, I was taking photos. 
Do not even know who you are. 

120 
She is Vanessa Carver. 

121 
Ex-atriz, today is the resident diva 
Edifício of Beacon. 

122 
Well, I did not offend. 

123 
My husband and I moved 
here. I am ... 

124 
A rat stock photography. 

125 
Mr. Butters should send spray 
the building. 

126 
Then you better be careful, "Mrs. Spider." 

127 
Pests! 

128 
She did one of those novels 
passing night. 

129 
You know, those full of sex and scandal? 
She quickly makes friends, right? 

130 
I think it is far from dying 
suffocated by his own vomit. 

131 
Oh God! 

132 
I'm Will Tyler. 
And I Bryn Shaw. 

133 
I met her sister. 
I know! 

134 
You're the kind of ... 
"My friends call me Ty." 

135 
And I bet you want to cause 
a good impression, right? 

136 
I have a job for you. 
Come! 

137 
Then, Bryn, always take pictures 
when you move into a new place? 

138 
Well ... yes. 

139 
I think so. 

140 
I always do. 

141 
It is cocnocer the new place? 
Have more control? It's smart. 

142 
What do you do, Will? 
Work on "KIein, Horstman & Enos." 

143 
Legal? 
No, it is an investment bank. 

144 
I am a foreign insurance analyst. 

145 
Monitoring the Stock Market 
Singapore. 

146 
That is, basically ... 

147 
... an elegant way of saying 
I'm stuck 
the night shift. 

148 
These photos are yours? 

149 
Yes, take a few years ago. 

150 
I think now you have 
some newer. 

151 
Yes, I think so. 

152 
Will, could you bring me that box? 

153 
White and black? 

154 
I like things 
the old fashioned way. 

155 
The black and white is not a 
bad way to see the world. 

156 
Look around ... 
As the call? 

157 
Mrs. Spider. 
Mrs. Spider! 

158 
What is it? 

159 
Do not know. 

160 
A shadow maybe, the mechanism? 

161 
No, that's an arm. 

162 
And that's a face. It's a ... 

163 
-No. 
It's a boy! 

164 
No, it can be. 

165 
Hello? 

166 
You must help me! 
Following me! 

167 
Who? Who is followed? 

168 
We got it! Here was

169 
He was to be behind the car radios. 

170 
There is a building block ... 

171 
... where all the cars stolen

172 
I will send repair this door 
and install a safety lock. 

173 
Excellent. 

174 
And you sir? There is something else you 
or your spouse wish to report? 

175 
We are not married. 
Really? 

176 
Sorry. 

177 
I like to go

178

180 
It is "the winner" official. 
To the victor, the salvos. 

181 
And is not no hero! 

182

183 
Third, please. 

184

find the man. 

185 
You must be new in town. 

186

187

189 
Excuse me, what is your name? 

190

Paul Shaw. 

191 
Nice, Paul Shaw. 

192 
Hello? 

193 
Bryn? Dear? 

194 
I'm here! 

195 
You took pictures! 
Yes, some things. 

196 
Nothing important. 

197 
And how did it go? 

198 
This was an excellent idea. 

199 
It occurred to me suddenly. 

200 
Then, she was pretty? 

201 
Who? 
-Who? 

202 
Your damsel in distress. 
It was pretty? 

203 
No, she was a witch. 
Calva, three teeth. 

204 
You're lying! 

205 
She had an eye on 
middle of the forehead. 

206 
One of the things 
I love you. 

207 
Today I met a friend of Christine. 
Will Tyler. He is handsome. 

208 
Should fall in love 
and have babies. 

209 
And you think that Chrissy? 
I think he will. 

210 
Today he saved me 
a horrible woman in the hall. 

211 
Vanessa. 

212 
Vanessa? 
Yes, it's an actress or model or something. 

213 
So, back to the woman 
you saved today. What is your name? 

214 
In the midst of confusion 
I forgot to ask. 

215 
Danny! 

216 
Danny! Danny! 

217 
Danny! 

218 
Find a focus, girls. 
That. 

219 
Smile. 

220 
Fingers stretched. 

221 
The kids call him 
"Surfing in the elevator." 

222 
They get on the roof of the elevator 
and jump from one to another. 

223 
And where are the parents? 
Where are the parents? 

224 
They are drunk? Drugged? 
This is dangerous! 

225 
I mean, look at these pictures! 
"No! 

226 
"No, look! This guy ... 
"It's not Daniel. 

227 
Not Daniel. 

228 
I know it's not Daniel! 

229 
You think that's the point? 

230 
And is not it? 
-No. 

231 
Okay, Bryn. 
No problem. 

232 
No problem. 

233 
I'm having dreams again. 

234 
You told Paul? 
"No, he is with his new job. 

235 
Two classes per week 
for repeaters in Science. 

236 
Three years ago, 
it rained bids. 

237 
He should not blame yourself. 
"He did not do it. 

238 
I do not blame. 

239 
Professor Paul! 
I brought donuts. 

240 
I hope you enjoy. 

241 
Hello, darling. 
Are you okay? 

242 
I told you not to go out! 

243 
Please, no! No! No! 

244 
Look at me! 
Look at me when I'm talking about! 

245 
Look into my eyes! 
"Please, Dad! 

246 
Look at me! 

247 
Now you'll see! 
I'll give you a lesson! 

248 
-Paul! 
-Bryn, what happens? 

249 
He was beating 
I heard the blows and screams! 

250 
And I could not ... 
What? Who? 

251 
You are Mr. Shaw? 
Yes, Paul Shaw. 

252 
Bryn, who is going? 
Are you okay? 

253 
Yes. 
I Karasic official. 

254 
This is the official Ford. 
Mr. Shaw. 

255 
His wife says he 
witnessed aggression. 

256 
I saw the children get there! 

257 
I heard screaming, 
and then I heard the shots ... 

258 
... and now let us 
go there ... 

259 
You did not understand ... 
"Please, Mr. Butters. 

260 
Mr. Butters, you can open 
the door and show us? 

261 
Police! 

262 
I saw him coming here, Paul. 
It's true. 

263 
No one lives here for months! 

264 
The apartment is empty. 

265 
Maybe these people fled as 
I call my wife to you. 

266 
And how they could get? 

267 
Change the locks whenever 
a tenant moves out. 

268 
I hold the keys 
in a chest down. 

269 
Who lived here? 

270 
The Nash family. 
They moved six months ago. 

271 
Why? 

272 
There was an accident. 
Their son was playing ... 

273 
In the elevator? 

274 
The boy slipped, fell down. 
It was terrible. 

275 
I saw him. 

276 
Damn, how many types of 
shampoo can be? 

277 
No one should underestimate 
the imprtancia a good shampoo. 

278 
One bottle can last for weeks. 

279 
Much more than a few 
of my relationships. 

280 
I think I can 
with commitment. 

281 
Well, lets see what is 
most important to you. 

282 
A good body? Resilience? 

283 
The elasticity provided 
is welcome. 

284 
Most men 
I prefer easy. 

285 
I prefer not sting the eyes. 
"Oh, you're the sensitive! 

286 
Here. 

287 
"Makes brushing." 
It is not for you. 

288 
... "Balance", "fruity" ... 

289 
How about this? 

290 
"Bold"? 
I think it's an excellent choice. 

291 
And you are doing here. 
These harassing me? 

292 
I still have my way to work. 

293 
Oh, yeah. Bryn told me 
you work at night 
in a bank. 

294 
That must be exciting. 

295 
I used to be. Now I would like 
more time for me. 

296 
Maybe we can get 
agreement on that. 

297 
Where is your cart? 

298 
Oh, you better 
Go look. 

299 
Or I'll walk 
to your car. 

300 
Hello, Bryn. 
Oh, Hello. 

301 
I'm coming. 

302 
Something does not smell right here, 
Indeed, Bobby? 

303 
A false alarm 
never smells good. 

304 
Why? 

305 
It's just a hunch. 

306 
You know that woman 
not told us everything. 

307 
Let, Kit remember what 
happened the last time. 

308 
Believe me. 
Your psychiatrist would say the same. 

309 
And who said the officers? 

310 
Is upset, 
and gave us a sermon. 

311 
I was told that Bryn 
under psychiatric treatment? 

312 
Yes. The officer said that as 
half of the city ... 

313 
... following treatment. 

314 
Bitch! 

315 
The building superintendent, Mr. Butters, 
I try to calm things down. 

316 
Bryn told me that you showed 
photos of the child. 

317 
Yes, I asked him to forget it. 
She did not want to mess. 

318 
You said you are having 
dreams again? 

319 
Here you go. 

320 
"Shoot the spider" 

321 
Hey, son! Let me take you out 
a photo. Come here! 

322 
Mom, I'm going to lose 
"Shoot the spider! 

323 
Only one more to the album! 

324 
Now smile! 
That! 

325 
Look at the sky. 
A picture for Dad! 

326 
"Mom! 
I know, you're going to lose 
"Shoot the chandelier." 

327 
Okay! Done. 

328 
Now you can go. 

329 
Look at me, Mom! 
Look at me! 

330 
Thanks. 

331 
Thanks. 

332 
He's coming. 

333 
I'm dreaming, right? 
You Ronnie Nash, right? 

334 
What is happening? 

335 
It was just a dream. 

336 
Everything? Are you calling me 
it was all a dream? 

337 
There was no child 
in the elevator. 
It's just ... 

338 
... I believe that these 
mixing your feelings. 

339 
No, you do not understand ... 
"No, I understand, yes. 

340 
When Danny disappeared, 
I listened to mourn your 
all the time. 

341 
Disarming the whole house. 

342 
And then the child who 
followed in the shopping ... 

343 
I scared! 
I thought it was Danny. 

344 
It seemed so 
Danny ... 

345 
He was identical to it, Paul! 
-Bryn, nor seemed ... 

346 
It was like, yeah. 
He did not looked like Danny! 

347 
Dr. Kirke warned us that we could 
move feel guilty. 

348 
And I want you to call her tomorrow ... 

349 
... recommended for you 
any doctor in the city. 

350 
Paul, why are you doing this? 
Bryn, Bryn. 

351 
We lost our son. 
We lost Danny. 

352 
And so, 
I almost lost you you ... 

353 
... and I will not let it happen again. 
I will not let it happen! 

354 
You understand? 

355 
Is that I have fear. 

356 
Of what? 

357 
I should be attending, 
was my responsibility! 

358 
I have so much fear that Danny hates me! 
God! The hate me? 

359 
Our son hates me! 

360 
Please do not hate me! 

361 
He does not hate you, dear. 

362 
He can not hate you. 

363 
I love you. 

364 
Oh, my God! 

365 
You know, appear to rescue 
is becoming a habit. 

366 
Very gallant. 
"Well, I'm new in town. 

367 
Where do you ride? 
How about Colorado? 

368 
I have not ski. 

369 
Sorry, I have 
snow covers. 

370 
Then you can leave in the middle. 

371 
I must settle accounts 
to my agent. 

372 
Why? Have you done? 

373 
I intend to make the mother 
of a teenager in a commercial ... 

374 
Perhaps I have mother's face 
of a teenager? 

375 
How are you? 
Thirty? Thirty-one? 

376 
You are an amazing man 
perpicaz. 

377 
Astronomers are 
very observant. 
I'll have to kiss you again. 

378 
I hate when I have reason. 
Not true! 

379 
Here is a report of 
Polícia of Peccadillo County. 

380 
How did you get? 

381 
Still I have some 
friends in the Department. 

382 
Our "Ms. False Alarm" 
Bryn Shaw, has a history. 

383 
She had a son. 
"He"? 

384 
Yes, he disappeared. 
About three years will 
next Halloween. 

385 
It was given as drowning, 
but never found the body. 

386 
It must have been hard for her 
and husband, then? 

387 
So call us now 
to report abuse of a child ... 

388 
.. Who happened also is dead? 

389 
It sounds like remorse. 
"Kit, do not do this. 

390 
Do what? 
My job? 

391 
You're not a detective. 
You came back to wear the uniform 
for a reason. 

392 
Something stinks here. 

393 
If you mess up again 
familiia other suffer. 

394 
And I think you can not 
live with it. 

395 
Where are you? 

396 
Oh, you crazy lady! 

397 
Gossip run. 

398 
Well, people in this building 
care should check their own lives. 

399 
So, you're not mad? 

400 
Totally. From head to toe. 
With certainty. 

401 
Well, I think the madness 
is underestimated. 

402 
Thanks. 
Pass. 

403 
In fact, 
I need to do me a favor. 

404 
Going to speak well 
me your sister? 

405 
Okay. 

406 
-Mr. Butters, occurred again. 
"You shook the handle? 

407 
Yes, the shaken, the turn, rolled her. 
So I gave a little dance. 

408 
Well, let's fix that bathroom 
before you suffer under others! 

409 
"Please send emails 
Nash, Rev. 418, a :.... 
Rev. B 2533 Gibson Street " 

410 
Mr. Nash? My name is Bryn Shaw. 
I live in the Beacon Building y. .. 

411 
Mr. Nash? Mr. Nash? 

412 
Mr. Nash? 

413 
Mr. Nash? 

414 
Sorry for the inconvenience ... 

415 
... but wanted to ask 
about Ronnie. 

416 
You know about the game? 
Surfing in the elevator? 

417 
A neighbor said she heard screams 
coming from your apartment ... 

418 
... and noise, as if someone 
was being beaten, 
and need to know ... 

419 
Mr. Nash? 

420 
Mr. Nash, I just wanted to know ... 

421 
You hit your child? 

422 
Ronnie was running 
you, Mr. Nash? 

423 
So he was hiding 
in the elevator? 

424 
Mr. Nash, I need to know. 

425 
What was your child doing 
in the elevator shaft? 

426 
Mr. Nash! 

427 
"He is coming" 

428 
Call the police a 
public phone ... 

429 
... and said she was worried 
by a friend. 

430 
I do not know how 
could explain it. 

431 
They will find it, right? 
And will take care of it? 

432 
If, yes. 

433 
You want to call Christina 
or your husband? 

434 
No, please. Because neither 
I know how to explain. 

435 
My God! 
dying alone and so! 

436 
It's hard to believe that 
whole family died. 

437 
What do you mean, the whole family? 

438 
The child, parent, and now the mother. 
All dead. 

439 
No, Ronnie's father was there. 

440 
Bryn, do not play well. 

441 
Why lie, Will? 
It was he who opened the door. 

442 
I do not know where it went. 
Not know how ... 

443 
... he came out of that bathroom. 

444 
Jim Nash died. 

445 
It happened here, just a week 
after the death of his son. 

446 
Mr. Nash took the sewing kit 
his wife, took out a scissor ... 

447 
... I get the screw 
connects the two parts ... 

448 
... And one of the sheets, 
he cut his own throat. 

449 
No way. 

450 
Thank you, Lieutenant. 

451 
Lt. Hutton adopted 
Beacon Building ... 

452 
... after what happened. 

453 
It's a good place. 

454 
People come, live, 
build their lives. 

455 
Most. 

456 
If the majority. 

457 
Take me to bed. 

458 
I'm not mistaken. 
Not this time. 

459 
Mail, Professor Paul! 

460 
Department of Science Festival? 

461 
Yes, I do every semester. 

462 
For students and 
teachers have 
opportunity ... 

463 
... fun together. 

464 
It will be Halloween. 
"Yes, that's the good part. 

465 
Because it is a folk tradition? 
"No, women in disguise. 

466 
They're hot. 
As I was told. 

467 
Bryn hates Halloween. 

468 
Look, I know this ... 

469 
Hey, we need to take 
a normal life, remember? 

470 
Even so, sorry. 
You look very handsome. 

471 
Hey, buddy. 

472 
Reinforcements! 

473 
You look fantastic. 
Thanks for the invitation. 

474 
Interesting costume for 
a financial analyst. 

475 
And the scientist says 
Dress magician! 

476 
What? 

477 
I remembered something I said 
on women in disguise. 

478 
... That particular issue, no ... 

479 
Thanks. 

480 
Well, I like everything 
related to the holidays. 

481 
I know ... 

482 
Darling. 
Thanks, dear. 

483 
Sure. 

484 
Look at them. 

485 
... collision with a Ford, 
and only got ... 

486 
Better go rescue them. 

487 
Ah, no, no. Stay here 
and make your contacts ... 

488 
... Share with your colleagues. 
I'll take care of that. 

489 
Are you sure? 
Claro. Abracadabra! 

490 
Esses is my point: 
everything is cyclical. 

491 
... The earth revolves around the sun, 
blood flows through our body. 

492 
... the water evaporates, returns as rain 
and evaporated again. 

493 
As my patience. 

494 
So if we have physical cyclic 
why not a cyclical paraphysical? 

495 
Type something supernatural? 

496 
No, no, everything belongs 
the natural world ... 

497 
Nothing can be "supernatural." 
Maybe out of the ordinary ... 

498 
... unusual. We die 
we become pure consciousness, o. .. 

499 
Ghosts? 

500 
Spirits, more precisely. 

501 
Or "soul" if you 
parateológico brain. 

502 
Ghosts are different 
dealing with minor cycles. 

503 
Why are not talking? 
I'll give you a ride. 

504 
I think I was annoying. 
Maybe a little anxious. 

505 
Professor Valencia 
I'm Bryn Shaw. I am the ... 

506 
The wife of Paul! Should have 
recognized by the holder portrait! 

507 
He looks pretty 
Really? 

508 
You said that ghosts 
cycles occupy less ... 

509 
You ... you think 
they exist? 

510 
I think it always pays 
worth asking. 
Why? 

511 
You saw the two appearances? 

512 
The child, several times. 
The father, only once. 

513 
In the apartment of the mother? 
Yes. It was very strange ... 

514 
... had several scissors 
hung on the walls. 

515 
They were open, so? 

516 
Yes, exactly. 

517 
The scissors is a cross 
to ward off evil spirits. 

518 
I think it worked. 
The cross is a symbol of faith. 

519 
If you need more of them 
because they do not think enough. 

520 
I think the boy was 
seeking help from her mother ... 

521 
... and the father followed him. 

522 
As I said, it appears that 
Nash dominated the life of your child. 

523 
Your spirit can follow 
dominate in death. 

524 
So, you think of me? 

525 
Was I lying about? 
Could be disrupted. 

526 
The disturbance can cause 
chemical changes in the brain. 

527 
The ghosts are 
a symptom of the imbalance ... 

528 
... disturbance or leaves it 
attuned to their world? 

529 
How I can release the child? 

530 
And because he thinks I should try? 

531 
Because it's just a kid ... 
lost, scared. 

532 
Parent, no. Appearances 
suicide are dangerous. 

533 
There is so much hatred. 

534 
For many years, suicide 
was considered a mortal sin. 

535 
The suicide could not be buried 
on holy ground nor enter into Heaven. 

536 
They were buried at night, 
secret, at the crossroads ... 

537 
... where criminals and witches 
were buried. 

538 
Look. 

539 
Literally nailed 
the drawer with stakes ... 

540 
... Not to be lifted. 
Like vampires. 

541 
There came 
the vampire myth. 

542 
As a vampire, it was believed 
the ghost of a suicide ... 

543 
could take 
a corporeal form. 

544 
Corporal? You mean ...? 

545 
Meat. A reminder of life 
that was wasted. 

546 
Everyone dies. 

547 
Death is inevitable: 
self-destruction, no. 

548 
Neither indifference. 

549 
It mantedrá away from father? 
I promise. 

550 
Please, just tell me 
and free the child. 

551 
Both are imprisoned in a cycle 
of abuse and guilt. 

552 
Break the cycle before he arrives 
at its most traumatic. 

553 
That would be the fall of the boy. 

554 
But be careful not 
reinforce the trauma ... 

555 
... or be trapped forever. 

556 
Simon? 

557 
If I break the cycle and assist 
the boy to make the passage ... 

558 
... He could ...? 

559 
What? 

560 
He could take a message? 

561 
Someone was mixing 
came with the medication. 

562 
It's good to be alive. 

563 
Hello, Mrs. Shaw. 
Hello, Paul. 

564 
Bryn? 

565 
I'm tired. 

566 
It was so embarrassing 
occurred in the elevator last night. 

567 
I do not suppose you told 
your wife about me. 

568 
"About You" would be 
exaggerate the situation. 

569 
Poor Lancelot! She forced you 
to sleep on the couch? 

570 
Vamos! I did not know 
I was a secret. 

571 
Nothing important, at least. 
What do you mean? 

572 
Discretion should be mandatory 
for someone in your field. 

573 
Looks like someone was 
research on the Internet. 

574 
It was good to flirt with a star 
decadent, but not with depraved. 

575 
I was not flirting with you. 

576 
Just need someone 
I may go to work. 

577 
Sign. 

578 
If I break the cycle and assist 
the boy to make the passage ... 

579 
He could take a message? 

580 
Tell ... 

581 
... I'm very sorry. 

582 
Tell him I love, 
I love him so much ... 

583 
Tell him to give 
my life ... 

584 
... my life 
just to see him again. 

585 
... Just for a moment ... 
Just to see him again. 

586 
Tell him I'm sorry! 
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! 

587 
Professor, I got information 
about our ghost hunt. 

588 
Still not investigate 
the story of his building. 

589 
In cases of apparitions, 
Most importantly is the place ... 

590 
... but in this case it is necessary ... 

591 
... since we have the luxury of knowing 
when they started 
the INDICATED ... 

592 
What are you talking about? 

593 
Instead investigate 
such as expelling a ghost. 

594 
.. ruling out a formal exorcism ... 

595 
... since the Catholic Church 
was more selective ... 

596 
... from that movie 
with green vomit. 

597 
Simon ... 
But it is much folklore 
less elitist. 

598 
Then, if we 
a piece of clothing ... 

599 
Nash 
or your child ... 

600 
... could make a thread 
giving 7 knots ... 

601 
... and burn. Hence the ghost 
would be forced to return ... 

602 
What ghost? 

603 
Ops! 

604 
You've been talking to 
my wife about ghosts? 

605 
James and Ronald Nash. 

606 
Find some newspapers 
they say that ... 

607 
Enough! For that! 

608 
My wife is 
under medical treatment. 

609 
She is sick, and need not 
your leave it worse. 

610 
But she seek. 

611 
And you did not see 
I was disturbed? 

612 
You are a tremendous desatre. 

613 
Nothing I say will change. 

614 
Nothing I say will change. 

615 
Nothing I say will change. 

616 
No one here? 

617 
The job ends at 5. 

618 
We raised videos on the Internet, 
we do photo shoots. 

619 
It's not pornography. 

620 
No need to justify yourself. 
"I do not. The Porn pay more. 

621 
In addition, so do not need 
take off my clothes ... 

622 
... to which I sometimes 
forced in Hollywood. 

623 
Why did you come here, Paul? 
I came to apologize. 

624 
Really? 

625 
I know how it feels to be 
caught in a difficult situation. 

626 
... listening to others 
judging. 

627 
I had no right. 

628 
It is very noble of you. 

629 
Not really understand 
the grace of all this ... 

630 
... but that should not affect 
the way I treat you. 

631 
You do not understand grace is this? 
"No, I do not understand. 

632 
Vanessa ... 

633 
You understand the grace, Paul. 
Grace is to have control. 

634 
I did not come here for that. 

635 
No? I have asked you 
apologies in the building. 

636 
I'm going. 
Too late. I'm stuck. 

637 
I can leave here, Paul. 

638 
Paul! Paul, wait! 

639 
Paul, please! 

640 
I can not let go, Paul! 
I'm helpless! 

641 
Paul? 

642 
Why are you doing this? 

643 
You said you understand how 
it feels to be trapped. 
Who caught you? 

644 
Nobody. 
I was not talking about me. 

645 
I am prey. 
I can not let go. 

646 
I am helpless, Paul. 

647 
Wives are false. 
Toys for the camera. 

648 
To be imprisoned is just ... 
An illusion. 

649 
Where were you? 

650 
What happened? 
Where is Bryn? 

651 
I came to visit Ty, 
but stop by here before. 

652 
She was lying in the bath 
babbling about Danny ... 

653 
... and a guy named Ronnie. 

654 
I gave him sedatives and lay down. 

655 
I was afraid that 
was hurt. 

656 
You did the right thing. 

657 
I know. 
But it should have been me. 

658 
Sorry you had 
to bother. 

659 
It will not happen again. 

660 
You can not leave you alone. 
Bryn What is happening is ... 

661 
What is happening Bryn! 
How could I forget? 

662 
Do not be selfish! 

663 
I lost my son. 

664 
My son disappeared 
 and probably dead. 

665 
And I can not even mourn for him. 

666 
I can show my pain ... 

667 
... I stay calm 
and support ... 

668 
... but lose 
 my wife also. 

669 
Listen, I know ... 
No! 

670 
You do not know. 

671 
You stayed with us 
 3 weeks after 
 the first attempt. 

672 
I live 3 years ago 
 counting pills, hiding scissors ... 

673 
... Knives hiding, hiding ... 
Your anger? 

674 
Well, she should have 
better care, right? 

675 
I said it once. 
But that's what you think, Paul. 

676 
That she did not care. 
"No, I do not think so. 

677 
But sometimes I like to ... 

678 
... to take care of itself. 

679 
And also me. 

680 
She is in a limbo, Paul. 
She is trapped. 

681 
You have no idea of power 
that gives a person 
 being trapped. 

682 
You know, when my girlfriend started 
 to talk about being cornered ... 

683 
... was usually because they had 
 made some stupidity. 

684 
You're really angry, right Paul? 

685 
You must learn to hide 
better. 

686 
Ground floor, please. 

687 
We need to know 
 Health Insurance Plan ... 

688 
... or the person being 
responsible for paying the bill. 

689 
We can see that count? 
No, sir. I need it now. 

690 
Put my name. 
Paul Shaw. 

691 
After we solve the rest. 
She is from the family. 

692 
Bryn, we go home. 
I can not. 

693 
They will call us ... 
if anything changes. 

694 
I do not know what is real, 
since we moved there. 

695 
But what happened to Chrissy 
is real, and I stay with her. 

696 
And I need you by my side. 

697 
And the department 
 and everything else? 

698 
Everything went wrong, I do not know why. 
I know we have a contract ... 

699 
No matter the contract. 

700 
We were better, Bryn. 
We felt better ... 

701 
... But the move, 
 we started a. .. 

702 
Get out of there. 
How? 

703 
Let's get out of there. 

704 
Let's stay in the apartment 
Christina. 

705 
We will stay in his apartment 
is closer to the hospital ... 

706 
... we stay with it. 
We will be moving today. 

707 
Okay? I go to school ... 

708 
... find someone to take 
my classes for a few days. 

709 
You go home and pack your bags. 

710 
I love you. 
Not survive without you. 

711 
Everything will be fine. 

712 
We're going. 

713 
Thanks, Mr. Director. 
I appreciate that. 

714 
I'm sure if Mr 
Thanks. 

715 
Paul! 

716 
I cut, Mr. Director. 
Ty, you're doing here? 

717 
I knew what happened to Chrissy. 

718 
I went to the hospital, 
but let me see her. 

719 
Karasic. 

720 
You received the call 
the hospital, sir? 

721 
I knew you were doing 
Bryn questions about Shaw and her husband. 

722 
Yes, sir. 

723 
As we make a visit. 

724 
No family 
can have such bad luck. 

725 
I will call my partner. 
We find there. 

726 
Only allow relatives. 

727 
Call your department, 
but nobody answers. 

728 
We were with her. 

729 
I came here because 
do not know what to do. 

730 
 - Professor Paul? 
Simon! 

731 
I should not have ... 
"Who is this? 

732 
Paul! 
Who is this? 

733 
Calm down, man! 
This is James Nash. 

734 
James Nash! He committed suicide. 
When? When was that? 

735 
About six or seven months, after 
that his son fell into the elevator shaft. 

736 
I saw him. 

737 
When we moved 
the building, I saw it. 

738 
You see it? 
In the parking lot ... 

739 
... was behind a woman 
a neighbor. 

740 
No way! 
I saw him. 

741 
He appeared to you, also to Bryn, 
and that other neighboring ... 

742 
It's the one who is asking for help. 

743 
The child's dominant 
dangerous. 

744 
Your wife is in danger. 

745 
Ronnie? 

746 
She wanted to break the ICFI 
and Iiberar the child ... 

747 
... but hate the child was 
I believe in the cycle. 

748 
I told her that 
 not to mess with suicide. 

749 
Suicide? No, the child's death 
was accidental. He fell, right? 

750 
And if the leap? 
To escape from the father? 

751 
What difference would it? 
In an appearance? You have no idea. 

752 
Explicame. 

753 
 - Ronnie? Ronnie? 

754 
Ronnie? 

755 
Please let me help. 

756 
I also had a son. 
His name was ... 

757 
... was ... 

758 
His name is Daniel. 

759 
Mama? 

760 
Danny? 

761 
Look at me, Mom! 
Look at me! 
Okay, honey. Okay. 

762 
No! No! 
No, Danny! 

763 
Ronnie ... 
He is coming! He is coming! 

764 
No! Please! 
Please open! 

765 
Suicides were fixed 
stakes in their graves ... 

766 
... with a stone on the face 
or chains around his head. 

767 
Chains around his head? 
That they will not be lifted. 

768 
You said Bryn 
was under medical care. 

769 
Please tell me she 
not suicidal. 

770 
Why? 

771 
Creatures with her 
is dealing, Nash and his son ... 

772 
... only know the anguish. 

773 
And the only way they 
to reduce your pain ... 

774 
... is seducing other 
to follow suit. 

775 
Ronnie? 

776 
Ronnie, I will not hurt. 

777 
You did? 

778 
Do not serve. 

779 
Let me talk 
with Danny again. 

780 
No, no. 

781 
Danny ... you're there, Danny? 

782 
He is coming. 

783 
Danny? 

784 
Look at me. 

785 
No! No! 

786 
No, Danny! No! 

787 
No! Again no, please! 

788 
Please let me wake up! 

789 
Let me wake up! 
Let me wake up! 

790 
Let me wake up! 

791 
Find sometHing in the records! 

792 
Before Building 
Beacon was the Beacon Hotel. 

793 
And, before that, was 
Hosted by the Beacon Street. 

794 
And that has to do with us? 

795 
Before that, he was the street corner 
Beacon Avenue to Church! 

796 
A crossroads! Where victims 
suicide were buried. 

797 
Then The Beacon 
is on a graveyard? 

798 
A deposit of bodies. 

799 
Then, when the child 
committed suicide ...? 

800 
The trigger that. 

801 
God helps those who mess with that! 

802 
Hello, darling. 

803 
Paul and I are going ... 

804 
... and I would like you 
do the same, Ms. Carver. 

805 
Considering all that we share, 
 you should call me Vanessa. 

806 
That's ... 

807 
That's disgusting. 
Really? 

808 
I think it's very sexy. 

809 
I know someone who also believes it. 

810 
Paul? Paul? 
Almost there. 

811 
It was very easy. 
To control ... 

812 
... coarse convince 
that I was helpless. 

813 
Paul would not do that, 
the no ... 

814 
Not what? 
He does not leave me alone. 

815 
Ah, my dear, people like us 
 are always alone. 

816 
These wrong. 

817 
Fast! 
We do not have much time! 

818 
Paul, does not open! 

819 
Stay in the car! 

820 
Do not turn off. 

821 
Paul, does not open! 

822 
Did you see that ...? Caramba! 

823 
He does not want to go up. 
Something is happening! 

824 
Call the police! Go through the basement. 
4O9 apartment. 

825 
What will I say? 
Tell my wife is in danger. 

826 
And who are you? 

827 
Came from the university ... 

828 
... when we reached the parking lot 
try taking the elevator ... 

829 
... and saw a child 
just not a child. 

830 
Really? 

831 
And you think you saw? 

832 
Are the Shaw! 
Okay. Stay calm. 

833 
Damn, Bob! 
Kit? 

834 
You were a good man! 

835 
How could you be so selfish 
to lose against someone like me? 

836 
What happened between you two ... 
We can fix it. 

837 
We forget. 
We can forget you. 

838 
Impossible, Bryn. 
You do not want to forget. 

839 
You do not want to forget ... 

840 
... us. 

841 
Kit .. Kit .. 

842 
This is not anything right! 

843 
And, Bryn? 
Do not look delicious? 

844 
You can not be ... 

845 
Dead? Ah, my dear, 
we are all dead here. 

846 
Son, I think it's time to go. 

847 
It's all the building! 

848 
God! Is the entire building. 

849 
Son, you're talking about? 

850 
Officer, who knows about this place? 

851 
Knows how many suicides occurred here? 

852 
Many. 

853 
Bobby, respond! Bobby! 

854 
What the hell?! 

855 
Kit .. 
Bobby, respond! 

856 
Bobby? Answers! 
He can not hear you ... 

857 
He does not know that you are here. 

858 
Let me alone! 
Let me alone! 

859 
Honey, you cried unto 
we came to you. 

860 
The only thing I think is 
 to complete your life. 

861 
We are butterflies 
attracted by your light. 
You're all I have, dear. 

862 
You are our beacon (beacon). 
Not true! Not true! 

863 
Vives distraught 
your husband betrayed you ... 

864 
... and you ... you lost 
your son ... 

865 
... forever. 

866 
Where do you think that you, boy? 

867 
You think you know about us? 

868 
Come to us ... 

869 
Police! 

870 
I want to see Danny ... 

871 
I want to see Danny again ... 

872 
Once again, please ... 

873 
Yes, dear ... 

874 
... have exactly what you want. 

875 
All we had. 

876 
Drive a stake into his grave. 

877 
Drive a stake into his grave. 

878 
Drive a stake into his grave. 

879 
He's coming. 

880 
You can not save it, Paul. 
Now it is ours. 

881 
Vanessa? 

882 
Are you one of them! You are ... 
"Say, Paul! A ghost. 

883 
Dressed in a body 
a body that feels. 

884 
But that was what 
 all were looking for here. 

885 
Bryn is what you want. 

886 
No! 

887 
No pain, no joy ... 

888 
... no reason to scream 
but we are crying ... 

889 
... forever. 

890 
Let her out of here, please. 

891 
No, we then need. 

892 
Why? 
"Because she still feels. 

893 
And, at the time 
in which she cut ... 

894 
... at that moment of agony delicious 
 We feel with her. 

895 
And you condemn her for that? 

896 
I would condemn a 
fraction of the time. 

897 
I do not really feel anything? 

898 
So this is just for me. 

899 
I lied when I said 
that prison is an illusion. 

900 
She is already ours. 
You no longer need. 

901 
No need to go there. 

902 
I love her. 

903 
Poor Lancelot. 

904 
Boy! Sal! 

905 
Get out of where you are! 

906 
Drive a stake 
 - Drive a stake into his grave. 


907 
Tyler. 

908 
She is ours now, Paul! 
"We trust you. 

909 
You gave back 
 and lost. 

910 
You can bring me back? 

911 
No, son. 

912 
You just gonna die. 

913 
Bryn, no! No! 

914 
Danny! I want to see Danny! 

915 
I want to see Danny! 
You can not! He was! 

916 
He died! 
Stop! 

917 
Calm down, Kit 
Calm down. 

918 
Your weapon, Officer. 

919 
I found 
my partner? 

920 
I'm not crazy! 

921 
We came together! 
I'm not crazy! 

922 
Here again ...! 

923 
Quiet. Let 
find your companion. 

924 
Those damned detectives me 
treated as if he were crazy. 

925 
I thought he was going to kill her. 

926 
I thought he was going to kill her. 

927 
Do not worry. 

928 
All is well. 

929 
All is well. 
We take care of you. 

930 
I love you. 

931 
What am I doing here? 

932 
Sorry. 

933 
I'm so sorry. 

934 
I would give my life to change this. 

935 
To go back. 

936 
Everything will be fine.
