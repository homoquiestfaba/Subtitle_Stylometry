Whoa!

Holy shit.

(INTENSE MUSIC)

This investigation will continue
for a period of time

as you well might know,
there's a lot of leads to be covered,

a lot of information to be obtained

and we are by no means
at any conclusion at this point,

or pointing a finger at anyone.

What about today?

I've been told that there have
been subsequent threats

to other clinics throughout Atlanta.

After these explosions?
Right.

Just, as a layperson I don't know
anything about these investigations

or incidences
but as a layperson it tells me

that these people are very serious,
that the first explosion,

while it was intended to hurt people was
also intended to bring folks to the scene

and then the second one was intended
to get them while they were there.

I'll confirm that because

the bombs had similar characteristics,
I won't jump to conclusions,

it's an open issue, we're alert to it.

(RADIO STATIC)

(BABY CRYING)

Okay.

Babe.

I got her.
It's your turn.

I got her.

(BABY'S CRYING CONTINUES)

What?

Good morning, good morning.

Yes, I see you!

Okay. Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

What? What?

Yes, yes.

Who's that, huh? Who's that?

Is that your nanna and your papa?

Huh? Is today their special day?

You gonna be good for Mom and Dad today?

Do you think she'll listen?

Probably not. She is a Walls.
Mm.

Who's that?
Hi.

Is that mama?
Good morning.

Look at that smile.

Hi, baby. Aw.

What time did you get home last night?
Midnight.

Saul giving you the day off?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, called it my...
"annual bereavement" day.

At least he cares. Good morning!

NEWSCASTER: <i>An explosion has shaken up
downtown Atlanta this morning.</i>

<i>Authorities are on scene now.
Marsha Jones reports.</i>

NEWSCASTER: <i>At 7:30 this morning an
explosion rocked the neighborhood of SoNo.</i>

<i>Residents say it felt like an earthquake.</i>

BYSTANDER: <i>I heard this boom out of nowhere
and I just said, 'get under the table.'</i>

NEWSCASTER: <i>Although an official statement
has yet to have been released,</i>

<i>it's believed
that the explosion originated</i>

<i>from the newly opened
Kairos Women's Clinic.</i>

<i>First responders are on scene,
and the immediate area has been evacuated</i>

(MUSIC STOPS)

Cap!

I feel under-dressed.
Thanks for coming in.

What you got?
Well, don't know.

The feds are already calling it theirs.
It's a freaking mess.

For what it's worth,
I'm sorry to bring you in off leave.

I know today's a really tough one.
Hey, no worries.

Captain Miller, Detective Walls.
What's up?

Well, we don't know,
the FBI is sending over their arson guy.

But until then, Detective Walls is on point.
Yes, sir.

I want this place locked up
tighter than a pastor's wallet.

And now Benjamin, I know you don't
typically run with knuckle-draggers

but we just want to make sure
that there's nothing else.

What the hell?

When the shit goes FUBAR,
remember who you boys call.

Yeah, remember who you boys call
when a thought process is involved.

Hey, look, I just don't want Special
Agent Brown up close yelling in my face.

Is he the one with the breath thing?
Oh, Lord!

It's like he's got an asshole
in his mouth.

So listen, I want you four
to sweep the two adjacent buildings.

Anything pops up you call it in
on the double. Got it?

Yes, sir.
Welcome back.

(INTENSE MUSIC)

Knock it open.

All clear.
All clear.

We're clear.

Walls, come here.
I want you to pull and hold that door,

I'm gonna go left,
you're gonna go right. Got it?

Hey!

Got a body here, just picking it up.

Jackson, call it in!

Listen, you guys... Hey, hey!

(SCREAMING, SIRENS)

(HEART BEATING)

Yeah, somebody upstairs likes you.

Let's just chalk it up to luck.

What happened?

There was another explosion. We can go
over everything once you've been cleared.

I've been cleared.
I need to get back on the scene.

Not yet. Just relax.

You stay in that bed, in this room.

Cap, I'm not doing anybody any good...
That is an order.

I'll be back to check on you.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Excuse me.
(GASPS)

Son of a biscuit, you scared me!

Well, that's one way to get
a girl's heart going!

Sorry.

Where is everybody?

That huge fire. They pulled everyone
out of here to help with the triage.

You mean the explosion downtown?

Maybe. I just came on a few hours ago.

Listen, I'm in room 403,
I can't find my glasses.

We normally leave personal items
in the room.

Best I can do is ask around.
I'm sorry, one more thing.

You didn't happen to see the gentleman
who came out of my room,

large man wearing a dark suit.
Captain Miller?

No, but I did see a group
of people over by the chapel.

Great, thank you.

Actually, it's back that way.

Oh, thanks.

We got a visitor.

Cap.

Ben, what are you doing out here?

Well, you know I'm not gonna
lay around in bed all day.

So what's going on downtown?
Well, nothing for you yet.

Look, I was thinking maybe I could go down
and walk the scene. Gotta find out...

No, that is not happening.
Feds got it locked down tight.

Maybe you could call
that pretty little wife of yours.

(COIN JINGLING)

Pay phone's in the waiting room.

I don't have my glasses. I can't see.
If anything changes, you let me know, okay?

You got it.

(LIGHT BUZZING)

Any luck on the glasses?

Not yet.

So you think the Yankees
have a shot at the Browns?

You talking about baseball or football?
Football, of course!

Oh, I don't think those work right now.

Oh, okay, so maybe they do.

You going up or down?
Lobby on three.

Oh, okay.

Go Browns!

(ELEVATOR BEEPS)

<i>Hello?</i>
Hannah.

Hey, baby. Listen, I'm fine, okay?

I'm at the hospital but, uh...
(PHONE STATIC)

Hanna, what's wrong?
(PHONE STATIC)

Hanna.

Hannah! Hannah?
(DIAL TONE BUZZING)

You should feel blessed.
You got to keep your quarter.

Thanks.

You can use the phone
in my office if you'd like.

No, thanks. Thanks a lot.

It's locked.

Yeah. You have a key for it?
Sure, but it's in my office.

Offer's still good on the phone.

Alright, yeah. Thanks, man.

The name's Peter Grayson by the way,

but most everybody here
just calls me Grace.

A man named Grace, huh?

Yeah, could have been worse.
Could have been a boy named Sue.

(TENSE MUSIC)

Have you seen my daughter?
She's six years old, dark hair.

She burnt her...




The hand of God forgives you.


You seem pretty anxious to get out.

Pretty anxious to call my wife,
let her know I'm okay.

Yeah.

Thought you said you didn't
have a key for this door.

I don't have a key for that door.

Big difference.



(RECORD PLAYS)

1887?

Nice.

1897.

She's been with me a long time.
She was a gift from my predecessor.

(PHONE DINGS)

Haven't seen one of these in a long time.
(DIAL TONE BUZZES)

(PHONE RINGING)

OPERATOR: <i>We're sorry, your call
cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

<i>Please check your number and dial again.</i>

<i>We're sorry, your call cannot
be completed as dialed.</i>

Before I forget, I believe
this is yours, Detective Walls.

<i>Ben, you're on leave.</i>

How do you know my name?

We knew your parents.

Terrible what happened to them.
Both of them, great missionaries.

I barely knew them so...
Ben, listen, before it's too late...


(TENSE MUSIC)

Ah, shit.


Don't... run from it.
Shh.

Okay. I'll go get you
some help in a second.

Alright? I'll go get you some help. Fuck!

(TENSE MUSIC)


Who are you?



Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Did you see that?

See what?

Did you get a good look at his face?

Not really.

I can't see anything that close
without my glasses.

Now who would let a far-sighted cop
become a detective?

You.

Right. Right. (CHUCKLES)

You know, I'm sure you saw... something,

but with all that's happened, maybe you...
Listen, I...

What I saw seemed real.
Well, fear tends to do that.

You able to reach Hannah?

No. (CLEARS THROAT)

Not now.

I think she's still upset
with me from this morning.

I see.

Listen, Ben...

I need you to think clearly,

just focus, push all that other stuff
aside for the moment.

You got it.

What do you remember,
before the explosion?

(DOOR OPENS)

Um...

we didn't see a body
in the security office.

Ben... you are to sit here
and finish that coffee.

What are you talking about? I know what I saw.
Ben! I'm serious, Ben.

Your ass better be in that chair
when I get back here.

Ben... come on.

This way.


I'm gonna go check in
and see if anyone moved him.

His name is Peter.

Okay.

Be careful.
I will.

(PHONE DIALING)

What am I doing?

Oh, Good Lord in Heaven,
you scared the bejesus out of me!

There's no need to take His name in vain.

Oh, right.

Sorry, it's just this place is so eerie
with everyone gone and all.

And that's exactly why I came to find you.
I need your help.

Oh, okay, but I'm a little busy right now
but I'll get another nurse for you.

No, no, no! It really, it should be you.

He's bleeding something horrible.
He looks like a security guard or something.

Oh, I need to get the detectives.

Detectives?

Well, could you help me
stabilize him first?

He looks like he might bleed out.
Yeah, of course.

In here?

Yeah. I think he's right down here.
I heard him as I passed by.

Please.

Have no fear.

We are with you.


Let it go, Saul.

You've been forgiven.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

Here. Ben shouldn't even be here.

I dragged him into it, the whole thing
is my fault. If Grace...

Ain't nobody coming to get us!
We're all just wasting our time.

Have a little faith, Jude.
Grace will find us.

I'm done with this bullshit.

Let him go. He's just blowing off steam.

It's a lot to take in.

And fuck Grace!

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(DISTANT WHISPERING)

Looks hot out there, don't it, Ben?

What's going on with the security guard?

He passed on.

They took his body upstairs.

Did you know him?

No.

Did he have a family?
Not quite sure.

Daniel said to keep an eye on you.

Daniel?
I mean Captain Miller.

Do you ever wonder what's out there,

beyond all this?

Pretty sure it's just Atlanta.

You ever think about death?

Nope.

My father was a pastor so...

That sort of thinking
doesn't do much for me.

I never thought I'd be a part
of something like this.

Most people don't. Um...

can I offer you a cup of terrible coffee?

I'm fine as frog's hair.

Fear not, Ben,

the Hand of God forgives you.


I don't want to hurt you, Ben!

(TENSE MUSIC)


Daniel says he wants him alive.

I'm gonna put Finnley down.

Yeah, sorry. It's my mojo song, baby.

Your mojo song.

You're probably the only cop
who listens to that and thinks that.

So you want to go
by your parent's grave today?

I don't know,
I'm thinking about going to...

what's that place?

Brick... what is it?

Brick... oh, Brick Store?

Yeah, I want to go to Brick Store, have
a few beers then maybe go to hidden cove.

You want to spend your day drinking beer
and sitting in the sun.

I'm not gonna complain.

Okay, I'll go get Finnley ready.

What's up?

(PHONE RINGING)

Ben...

Saul's on the phone,
he says it's important.

So listen, I want you four
to sweep the two adjacent buildings

anything pops up, you call it in
on the double. You got that?

Copy.

Hey!

Got a body here. Just picking it up.

Son of a bitch.

Come on.

It's me. So you threw a tantrum
'cause I told you to sit?

I think I found something.
Centennial Park,

one of the eyewitnesses said something
about an EMT being on the scene.

Can you read that?

"EMT near the bag that was later found
to be the bag with the pipe bomb."

Okay, we're gonna see the same thing

in the Birmingham bombing.
So where's this coming from?

I've been trying to remember.

When Jax and I first entered the building,
we saw two men dressed as EMTs.

The guy that knocked me down
in the hallway

was wearing a blue jacket with patches.

Yeah, but that doesn't mean much.

The office manager in the Birmingham
bombing said that she found it odd

that there was an EMT on the scene
the day before looking around the explosion.

So you think one of the bombers was here
dressed as an EMT?

Okay, why would they come here?

Tie up loose ends? I mean,
they've already come after me once.

So you've seen others,
aside from the nurse?

Listen, I come around the corner

and this big son of a bitch throws me up
against a wall, and both of them armed.

Something's going on,
something's not right.

She said something about...

"Daniel wants me alive."

Okay.

So who's Daniel?



Be calm.

My name is Daniel.

If you promise me
that you can stay calm...

I'll remove the gag.

But if you break your promise...

do you understand me?

Stay calm, stay calm.
It's okay, Jude. It's okay.


Here we go,

there we go, that's better.

I want to take this moment,
I want to talk to you...

about our Lord God.

Are you a believer, Jude?

It's a very simple question, Jude,
there's no right or wrong answer.

Do you believe in the Lord, our God?

No.

I don't know. I did when I was a kid.

That's okay.

That's okay, Jude.

That's a very familiar tale these days.

But if I were you I think now would be
the time for you to resume your faith.

What do you want?
Have no fear, Jude.

For those that fear our God trust our God.

Your helpers trust your ruler.

Jude, we're here to give you freedom.

Freedom, Jude.

I heard that shit before!
Wait, what are you doing?

Let me go! Fuck you! Fuck you, honky!

Fuck your God! (SCREAMING)

"The mouth of the just bring forth wisdom.

But the sour tongue shall be cut out."

The Lord our God is waiting for you, Jude.

Be with the Lord.


Well... they're all the same type.

Amonium hydroxide, iodine, iron shrapnel.

Alright, that's almost identical to...
Your parents' church.

I thought that was all race-related.

(DOOR OPENS)
Yeah, me, too.

They came for him.
Who came for who?

For Ben.

Found it, here you go.

But, wait, I don't understand,
I thought that we just...

needed people who didn't believe.

Yes, we do, but he's different.

But we're exposed out in the open.

Do you want to take a vow
of silence like Jude?

Ah!

We thought you was them.
Isaac... your hand doesn't look good.

Nah, nothing but a scratch,
had it worse in the war.

So, Jude never came back?
No.

Who are these people?
These are friends.

We got to get Isaac's hand fixed up.
You stay with these guys. I'm gonna go...

No, no, no, no, no.
I'll go get a doctor, you stay here.

Ben, it doesn't sound
like a really good idea, man.

They're not looking for you.
They're looking for me. I'll be right back.

Ben...

watch your six.

Okay, tell me what happened.
It was a nurse.

They came up to us
and they asked for Ben by name.

Why?
I don't know.

Who are they?

Does it have anything to do with Grace?

No, I don't think so.

Ben's experience has been
different from mine. Ah...

Something doesn't feel right.

(PENSIVE MUSIC)

Still not used to them.

I'm sorry about earlier.

Ben, not every case is your parents.

It was just a gas leak.

I got to check it out.
Just every time I...

it's more than just us now.

Right?

I'll be right back.

I'll be right back.

(TENSE MUSIC)

Sights and wonders abound.

Now, Benjamin...

I would very much like to remove
your gag but in doing so...

you need to promise me
that you will not scream.

I find it terribly upsets my calm.

Can we come to an agreement?

Good.

There now.

That's better.

That's better.

Now, I assume...

that the truth has found you.

What, that we're all dead?

Dead? No.

No, I can assure you, Benjamin,
that we are all...

very much alive.

I've seen it.

I've seen it, too.

But it's not... how it seems.

For death...

our Almighty has given me
dominance over all mankind.

I don't believe any man...
Your parents didn't believe either.

You see, I...

I was part of that misled flock.

Till I realized that their arrogance
had consumed them.

They even lacked the courage
to punish those that had sinned

in the eyes of our Lord.

You set that bomb.

You set the fucking bomb.

I'll fucking make you pay
for what you did!

For what I did?

For what I did?

I set out to beg God for forgiveness.

I wanted nothing more than to prove to Him

that not all men have carelessly
aligned themselves with faggots...

and murderers.

That church, that abomination,
they started this war,

they fired the first shot.
You just murdered innocent people.

Our dread, most sovereign Lord

requires that whosoever shed man's blood,

by man shall his blood be shed.

But not... not out of hatred...

but out of love.

It's our life...

for yours.

You see, it's a very simple equation.

Why the first explosion?

The first one was merely bait.

For who? For me?

The arrogance again.

Not intentionally, no.

See, you and your brothers,
you protect a false God.

And that...

is the only eternal sin.

You shall not be tortured...

by our hands,

for vengeance belongs to God alone.

But execution is rarely gentle.

Is this what you really want?

Hannah.

How are you here?
Is this what you really want?

I don't know what I want.

Do you remember your mother's last words?

"Don't run from it."

Well, then...

is this finished?

No, it isn't.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

Kill it!

Kill it!



Kill them all.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

(BANG ON DOOR)

Shit!


All have sinned,

and fall short of the glory of God!

Why didn't you tell me?

There are rules, Ben.

Believe me, I wanted to.

SAUL: Ben, stop!

Ben, stop!

Come on, stop.

What the hell are you waiting for?

(INTENSE MUSIC)

(DISTANT DOOR SLAMMING SHUT)

Listen to me, they are coming
and they're armed.

Trust me.

Take them with you.
No, Saul...

Go, I'll cover you.

Please, what are you doing?
This is suicide!

No... not if you're already dead.

Go.

I'm staying, I'm staying!

You got a spare mag?

(GUN COCKS)

SAUL: Know how to use that thing?
Yeah, been a few years.

What are you doing?

Looking for a key.

(GUN COCKS)

Alright, let's go.
Okay.


There, the staircase.
It's locked.

Faith is a skeleton key.

I wish faith was a rifle.

Don't go down.
Go, go.

(TENSE MUSIC)


Come on.

(DOOR SHAKES)

God damn it.

You still don't get it, do you?

We are being tested,

it's about faith.

Faith in what?

'Cause I'm pretty sure
we didn't get a pass.

Some do, at the chapel.

Yeah? Is that why you guys were all...

hanging out down there, waiting
for something magical to happen?

Grace is a gift,

it's not something you can take.

I don't know.

I just miss my family.

I know what it's like.

I lost my son when he was 23.

What happened?

Vietnam.

How long did you say you've been here?

Couple of days.

You know, Ben...

when we cross over I don't think
we remember our past.

It's as if that...

passion is... removed.

We're all here because at some point
we had a seed of faith.

This place...

it's our last chance for redemption.

It's my last chance for revenge.

Don't leave this room.

I'm going after Miller and Isaac.
Ben.

Yeah?

Grace doesn't always
have to come from God.


SAUL: Isaac!

Isaac!

Isaac!

Deborah?

SAUL: Isaac!

Let him go. Take me.

We don't want you.

(GUN SHOT)

Let him suffer.


(EERIE MUSIC)

(DEMONIC SCREAMING)


Oh, shit.


Come on!
(SCREAMING)

Sometimes faith is a stairwell.

Saul, what happened?

Where's Esther?
Hiding.

Where's Isaac?
Forgiven.

What?

"For by grace are you
saved through faith...

it is the gift..."

of God.

Thought you didn't believe in that stuff.


It wasn't clear...

till I came here.

Did you know that he killed my parents?

No, no.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ben.

I'm gonna kill him.
No, you can't.

Why?

SAUL: Ben, every man
has to find faith for himself.

It's the only real rule here.

And grace is the only gift.

How long have you been waiting?

It's only been a... a few days for me.

But it doesn't matter.

You save Esther...

and yourself.

(INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC)

I'll see you around.

I hope so.

"Beware of false prophets
disguised as sheep

but are as vicious as wolves."

You should have died for us, Ben.

Willingly.
I'd rather not.


I don't want to die in here again.

I don't want to die in here alone.
(GUNSHOTS)

Whoa, whoa.

I'm so sorry.

She made me tell her where you were.

You're bleeding.
I know.

I came back for you.

Ben...

please don't run from it.

Run from what?

Grace.

Come on.

Please don't leave, Ben.

There's some questions
I'd like to ask you, please.

Still here.
Wait.

I can feel it.

You're shaking.

I know.

I'm on the edge.

Are you up for trying this?

Last time I was over there...

I was just a kid, you know?

Yeah, I know.

But it's okay 'cause it was right here,

right in this hospital.

I don't want to.

Casey.

Casey, this is gonna put us on the map.

Right?

You can finally ask him.

Okay.

Okay.

Alright, I'm gonna get everybody up here,
alright? So you're not alone.

Okay? We're gonna document everything too.

Where's that from?

An explosion.

You're the little girl.

You saw me?
I saw you here, too.

I always thought that you were...

my angel.

I guess you're not the only weird one.

Daniel...

how do you know about him?
We all know about him.

He didn't die at the explosion.

What?

Oh, fuck, there's two of them!
<i>Two what?</i>

Laser grid detected two entities, they're
shadows. Two shadows are coming your way!

<i>I'm gonna go check it out.</i>
Don't fucking move! I mean...

Yeah, move, just don't...
I'll be right there!

Fucking strap!

Alright, well, we're ten minutes in.

We haven't had any other... activity yet.

Apparently, there's two more shadows
on the fourth floor so...

think I'm gonna go check it out.

I don't see anything.

Oh, shit!

BEN: When did he die?

Few days before his trial.
Case is still open.

There was another man
with Daniel that day.

An EMT.

Did you see his face?
No.

Do you think that you could...
get a name for me?

It's not that easy, sweetheart.

Look...

we could change all of this.

We just need a name.

Listen, you need to go back
to wherever it is you came from.

It's not safe here.

You know...

he took my mom, okay?

And all of those people.

We need justice, okay?

(TENSE MUSIC)

Run.

WOMAN: Kris, we gotta go!
Why?

Come on! We gotta go!

I see you've met our guests.

Let them go.

It's amazing how much power
I have here, Benjamin.

I will capture those demons
and I will throw them back

into the pit of hell that they came from.

You're as fucked as I am.

You're nothing here but another lost soul.

My soul is anything but lost.

I am the Hand of God,
I am the Keeper of the Gate.

What about grace?

I guess I am grace now.

WOMAN: Hey, give me your spirit box.
Why?

Give me your spirit box.

Fucking loud. (ECHOING)


(GUNSHOT)
(GRUNTS)

Miles, get out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

Now!


Shit.

I don't want to do this anymore,
I'm gonna call the cops.

No. No, no, no. Shh. Don't.

Kris, come in, Kris!

Kris, can you hear me?

Miles.
Kris.

MILES: Holy shit.

(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

Holy shit.


It's empty.

(SHOTGUN COCKS)

Faith is an extra shell.

Oh, shit. No.

I'm not here to harm you.


(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)



Where's Kris?

Oh, are you okay?

Yeah, I think so.

What the fuck just happened?

I don't know.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

Yeah.
Have you heard from Brandy or Alfie?

Last I heard they were on the second floor.
We cannot leave them here, okay?

Oh, shit.
Let's just go.

Grace, huh?
No. I'm Peter.

What I offer is grace.

So, why didn't I cross over?

Because you're not ready yet.

Says who?

Your heart.

Here, guys. Here.

Come on.

Alright, here we go, guys.

Kris.
Get in.

Oh, dude, you alright, man?

No, my shoulder is pretty jacked up.
What the fuck?

Oh, shit!

(ALL YELLING)

Let's get the fuck out of here!


Wonder how long I'm gonna
have to wait for you to die.

Patience has never been my best virtue.
(GRUNTS)

Brent!

We need to leave right now.

What to do? What to do?

What's the plan, Kris?

Alright. Alright, listen.

Uh-huh.
We need to split up.

What?
Are you serious?

I'm gonna stay here and wait for Brent.
No, no, no, we stick together.

Yeah, yeah, Casey's right. We came
here as a team we gotta stick it out...

Here's the plan, I'm... Listen!

What is that?
This is beyond fucking...

Oh, shit!
Kris!

Oh, my God!

Alf!

Why are you doing this?

Because Daniel has shown me the truth.

And the truth will set...
Stop!

...me free!
Stop!

Brandy?

Where's Brent?

Dead.

You need to find Ben.

Is he okay? Where is he?

He's looking for Daniel.

Where are you going?

The chapel.

<i>â™ª You can run on for a long time</i>

<i>â™ª Run on for a long time</i>

<i>â™ª Sooner or later God will cut you down...</i>

Wait, Brandy.


<i>â™ª Go tell that long tongue liar</i>

<i>â™ª Go and tell that midnight rider</i>

<i>â™ª Tell the rambler, the gambler,
the back biter</i>

<i>â™ª Tell 'em that God's gonna cut them down</i>

<i>â™ª Tell 'em that God's gonna cut them down</i>

<i>â™ª Tell 'em that God's
gonna cut them down...</i>


You're nothing but an overzealous pariah.

I am the right hand of God!

BEN: I love you.
I know.

BEN: I remember my father calling me...

and he was so excited...

about the direction of the church.

He said there was gonna be an exodus.

That the church had abandoned...

wrath, fire and brimstone,

for a God who offers peace...

love...

grace...

and forgiveness.

You'll find none of that here.



Sucks, doesn't it?

That fucking sucks, doesn't it?

Who was with you?

Who was with you?
The Lord is my shepherd...

I shall not want.

He maketh me lie down in green pastures.

You know you took my family.

He leadeth me beside still waters.
You destroyed the lives of so many others.

Restoreth my soul.

Yay, though I walk through the valley...

Oh, no, walking is done.
...of the shadow of death.


(WRITHING IN PAIN)

God, enough!

You wanna tell me his name?

Hmm?

Fuck you!

What are you doing?

You might not want to see this.

No. No, no, no, no, no!

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

It's only gonna get worse.
Help! Please, please help me!

No! Don't you talk to her!
(CRYING IN PAIN)

Get out of here. Get out.
You're torturing him!

That's what you want, right?
To get a name!

Oh, take me home.

Take me home, take me home.

Not yet.

Give me his name.

Give me his name, or number two...

here goes the second one.
What's his fucking name?

James.

James what?

What's his last name?

Thompson.

Good boy.

Did you get that?

James Thompson.

Would you give that to my wife?

Wake up, wake up.

Come on.
We gotta get Kris.

Yeah, yeah.
Come on!

Hi.
Um, does Hannah Walls live here?

Mom, there's some lady here to see you.
Who is it?

I don't know but she used
our old last name.

Hey.
Hi.

Can I help you?
Miss Walls?

Uh, it's Anderson now.

Right. Sorry. Um...

I found these.

I think they were your husband's.

Did you know him?

Um, I knew of him.

He was a really good man.

Yeah, he was.

He died a hero, you know.

Yeah.

Anyway, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Finnley!
Yeah?

I'd like to show you something.
