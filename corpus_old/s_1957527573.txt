Mmm.





Read all about it!

Killer strikes again!

Read all about it!

Killer strikes...

We've got another one.

Amelia, good.
You're here.

The body was found
early this morning.

If I had to guess,

she was probably killed
only a few hours before that.

As of the moment, no witnesses.

Of course.

Red hair.

The guy definitely has a type.

The wound matches exactly
what we've seen before.

I see we've got some
blood splatter here,

the angle of which suggests

he was on top of
her when it happened.

She saw it coming.

Not sure if that makes
it better or worse.

It's fairly small amount of
blood for how much she's lost.

We won't know that for sure

until Seward gets a look
at her back at his lab.

I think it's time that
we face the facts

that we might
be dealing with a...

Spit it out, Van Helsing.
Trepidation doesn't suit you.

Mass murderer.

This is one of those occasions
where I hate to say it.

I agree.

And we're not alone.

Are they still on about this?

Unfortunately, yes.

They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

It's lazy sensationalism.

Like you said, sells papers.

You gotta admit.

A century-old mass murder case
that ended at a creepy castle,

the kind of stuff
that whets the appetite.

Yeah, if you believe in myth and
ghost stories and not in facts.

Besides, see,
they didn't mention

that we did our due diligence,

did a sweep of the castle
and found nothing.

Why let facts get in the way?

I can't have the press
interfering with my case.

What are we gonna do?

We aren't.
I will.

What you need to do
is get to work

and solve this before it
gets even more out of hand.

What could even do this?

Well?

Well, every time
I find something

that I think is conclusive,

I find something
that contradicts it

and makes me doubt myself.

Renfield seems to think that
the relatively recent nature

of this one's passing might
help us answer questions.

Oh, Renfield, the good captain,

doesn't seem to understand that
to be able to accomplish that,

you have to have
somewhere to start.

And this... this just
doesn't make any sense!

What do you mean?

Well...

all the bodies died from
a massive amount of blood loss,

right, brought about
from a neck trauma?

And though these slashes
are serious,

they're just not congruent
with your

regular jugular slash
or throat cut.

You know what I mean.

There's gotta be
something we're missing.

Impossible problems...

Have probable solutions.
Yes, I know, I know.

Maybe we just have to look
at the facts we have.

We know that the lacerations
and trauma caused by the wounds

severed the jugular,
leading to death.

And it was done with
relative efficiency.

Yes, yes, yes, but the
tearing of the epidermis

around the punctures
is not done by any bladed weapon

that I know of.

It's almost like it's...

like a bite.

Could it be a bite?

They just don't match,
the spacing

and our canines are just not up
to that level of efficiency.

And then there's
the blood, right?

This body is a dried husk.

If all the blood is gone,
where does it go?

Well, that's' the question,
isn't it? That's the kicker.

Of the blood that's left,
do we have a sample?

Uh, yes, yes.

I ran some tests to see
if the killer used any kind of

a sedative or
an outside chemical

to sort of subdue the victims.

But... I ran it a
couple of times,

I couldn't find anything.

Can I have that?

I don't usually let
evidence out of the lab.

Where are you going?

I want to see if Harker
can turn anything up.

Oh, I knew it.

He's a brilliant
chemist, Jack.

And we look at details
as they pertain to the case.

He looks at them
in a scientific puzzle.

Yes, yes.

And he's able to turn
things up we often miss.

Yes, yes, he's been very
helpful in the past, I agree.

You bring my blood back.

I'll see what I can do.

Let you know if
we turn anything up.

And you owe me a dinner
for all this!

I'll tell Mina
you're coming over.

Maybe she'll make
you that roast again.

Ooh, roast.


I didn't expect you so soon.

Do you have what I require?

Yes...

Master.

So you're telling me
there was no blood

anywhere else in the room?

Seems impossible, right?

That vial is what
Seward managed

to extract from the body,

And this was it?

More or less.

How curious.

Sort of why I'm here.

You know I always appreciate

when you bring me
a puzzle to solve.

Unfortunately, it's not
like when we were kids.

I suppose.

Bigger challenges,
bigger stakes.

That's one way to put it.

You think you can analyze it?

I believe I can.

In fact, I have several
texts around here somewhere

which might actually
provide some clues...

I came to you as
a chemist, Jonathan,

not because of your hobbies.

The study of occultism
is no mere hobby.

It provides insight into
things we have yet

to even begin to comprehend.

I appreciate the interest,
but the study of magic

and ghosts is
no comparison to facts.

And, quite frankly,
that's what I need right now.

There are those that
believe that magic

is merely science
we don't understand yet.

There is a very
real mass murderer

stalking the streets
right now.

I came to you
because you're able

to put scientific bits
of the puzzle together.

I admit that
there are some cases

we couldn't have
cracked without you.

That's the Jonathan
I need right now.

If there's something in that
blood that shouldn't be there,

I'll find it.

I just need some time.

Thank you.

Don't take too long, though.

Seward was already on edge that
I had to borrow his evidence.

Oh, Jack.

What did you have to
bribe him with this time?

Dinner?

How'd you know?

His pride won't allow
him to admit this,

but he lets me bring you things
'cause he knows you get results.

Prove us both right, yeah?

Tell you what.

If I don't bring you
back something,

I'll make dinner
for all of you.

Things are bad enough
out there as it is.

Let's not make it worse.

Hey!

Amelia? I didn't expect
you home so soon.

Didn't mean to scare you.
It's just been a long day.

I figured I'd grab
a bite to eat.

How are you doing, beautiful?

What's the occasion?

I didn't miss
anything important, did I?

No, you're off the hook.

These actually aren't for us.

We have company.

We do?

You know how I've been
hoping that the firm

would eventually let me
handle an account on my own?

But it just felt like they
were making me wait forever?

Mina, tell me what
I think you're gonna say.

Well, a new account
just came in...

and this foreign dignitary
who's looking for some

real estate here
in the city...

and they assigned me
to help him.

That's amazing!

Thank you.
It's a big deal.

If I can pull this off,
then I might just be able

to prove that I can make it as
a successful solicitor yet.

They're not gonna
know what's hit them.

And the wine?

Oh, that's the thing.

The dignitary, the man
that I'm helping find a place,

he's here.

He is?

It's late.
Yeah.

And I just thought that maybe as
a get to know you gesture

that I should...
Absolutely.

You've celebrating to do!
Go, go, go!


Miss Mina!
I didn't realize we had company.

Yes.

This is my girlfriend,
Amelia Van Helsing.

She arrived here while
I was getting our drinks.

Amelia, this is Count Dracula.


You know,
I don't drink wine often.

But this has been lovely.

So glad you were able to
join us, Miss Van Helsing.

Mina didn't tell me she
had such a charming partner.

Amelia, please.

And of the two of use,
Mina is the charming one.

Far too many people
grumble at my presence

to think otherwise.

It's just nice to
have her home for a bit...

what with everything.

Ah, yes.

I've read some of the
garish details in the papers.

Don't take everything you read
in the local rag at face value.

I rarely do.

Thought I must confess,
when I read the name

of the investigator
in charge of the matter,

I never expected
to be dining with her

later that evening.

Strange coincidence, isn't it?

The world is full of them.

It's comforting
to know the police

are working so diligently
on the matter.

So, are you looking
to relocate permanently

or just acquiring properties?

It all depends on what
the lovely Miss Mina shows me.

A little bit of both, I suspect.

A number of years ago,
I spent a little time here.

There was just something
about it that felt like home.

I think that's lovely.

Just a feeling
of certainty one gets.

I've been traveling
abroad for a great while.

Somehow I always knew
what I wanted was here.

Well, then must
find him a good place.

Dinner party
etiquette demands it.

I have utmost faith
in Miss Mina's acumen.

When I visited
the solicitor's office,

I saw her and knew
she'd be the one to help me.

I didn't realize that
my assignment was by request.

I made the suggestion and the
partners at your firm obliged.

I wanted someone who sees
the city a little differently.

I had an instinct
and I followed it.

And my instincts
are rarely wrong.

I... don't know what to say.

I'm truly honored.

I won't let you down.

I don't know about you,

but this seems like the perfect
excuse for another toast.


Who could that be at this hour?

[knocking continues]

Jonathan, what's...

It's too terrible
to consider, Amelia!

But when
the evidence suggests...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The improbable is probable,
we must, we must!

Could you keep it down, please!

Mina's having a work dinner.

I don't need to
cause unnecessary alarm.

Sorry.

I just... I think
I found something.

With the blood?

Potentially.

And if I'm right,
it's something awful.

Let's talk outside.

What's going on?

There were trace amounts
of saliva in the blood.

But the more
significant thing is

what that can
potentially represent.

I don't understand.

The punctures,
the absence of blood,

the calculated kill crossed
with the primal violence.

It all felt too familiar
to be coincidence.

So I started cross-referencing
some of my texts.

And all signs
point to Nosferatu.

I think we may
be dealing with a vampire.

A what?

The vampire is a
perceived mythological creature

of undead origin...

I know what
a vampire is, Jonathan.

But if you recall,
I explicitly asked you

to stick to science on
this one, no fairy stories.

I know, but it could
explain so many of

the unknown variables
of the case:

[phone rings]

The irregular wound,
the loss and absence of blood.

You and your colleagues
missed certain details

because they were things you
didn't even know to look for.

Are you hearing yourself?

There's a very
real serial killer

stalking the streets
and murdering women.

I need something that is
going to help me find him now!

I appreciate your reticence,

but I said it before
and I'll say it again.

Sometimes the things
we consider fantastical

are merely truths
we're not yet

allowing ourselves
to understand.

I'm sorry, Jonathan,
but I just...

You just got a call.

They need you.
There's been another...

There's been another murder.

Mina, please see Count Dracula
out and lock the door.

I'm coming with you.

Like hell you are.

Ah, Amelia.
It's good you're here.

Oh, surprise.
Look who you brought.

Jack.
Jonathan.

I thought you'd be out
chasing ghosts or something.

Nope. I've been too busy
doing your job for you.

Boys... play nice.

I'm surprised to see
you out of the lab.

Renfield had more
important things to do.

And he suggested that
if I showed up at the scene

I might be able
to glean something

out of the body's natural
habitat, so to speak, you know.

And?

Well, fits our pattern.

Red hair,
trauma to neck.

Cause of death,
massive blood loss.

But the difference here
is that this body's

been here for two,
maybe three, days.

When the guys got here,
they had to open the windows

because the neighbors were
complaining about the smell.

Was anyone seen
coming or going?

They're out
canvassing the neighborhood,

but I don't think so.

How does someone come in,

do something like this,
and no one notices?

Well, that's
the kicker, isn't it?

It's not just getting in.
How did he get out?

What do you mean?

When we got here,
they had to use a prybar

to open the door, all right?

Because everything:
windows, doors, everything,

was locked from the inside.

What about a key?

She lived alone,

has all the keys
in her possession

and they're accounted for.

And the landlord says that
no one else has any others.

So you're telling me

the perpetrator
entered a locked room

without forced entry,

viciously murdered a woman
and disappeared without a trace?

Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

I just... for someone
to be able to do that,

they'd have to be...

Capable of the impossible.

Impossible is an illusion

that's created when
you have the advantage.

And right now,
our killer has it.

But he's only one person

and what he's
not banking on is us.

Good.

You're awake.

Do you understand
the implication here?

It essentially proves
there's merit to my theory.

What's he talking about?

Don't start on this again.

You said you wanted facts.

Maybe it's time to start looking
at the ones you already have.

The assailant is biting throats

and somehow getting into
impossible rooms with ease.

What does that
sound like to you?

I have no idea.

There's a strong
chance the perpetrator

is in fact a vampire.

Oh, how clever!

Forget the
mythological connotations!

Exsanguination
is found in several instances

in the animal kingdom.

It's therefore,
entirely probable

that there's
a human equivalent!

I get you're trying
to be helpful, Jonathan.

But what you're suggesting
is not supported by reality.

I would buy that the killer
thinks they're a vampire.

But as for the real deal,
there's no such thing.

Stories of vampires exist
in almost every culture.

The jiangshi of China,
the sasabonsam of Ghana,

the shtriga of Albania...

all variants on
the same concept.

If it was only folklore,
then how did all of those

very different and
very distant places

all arrive at
the same conclusion?

Sociologically,
that's a wonderful argument.

But real science
does not support it!

Besides, vampires are supposed
to be dead, aren't they?

Undead.

Oh, well, there I have you.

Bio-matter starts to decompose
almost immediately at death.

So reanimation?
That's almost impossible.

It's like a roll
of the dice, isn't it?

Maybe that's why they
need to drink blood.

Drink blood?
Bathe in blood!

Those kind of unsciences, they
died in the Neolithic period!

The point is, there's a very
logical explanation, Jonathan.

The collection of blood
was cited in a number of

very human, very real,
serial killer cases.

And in each circumstance,
it was just a matter

of figuring out which method
and tool was used to do so.

I just think that...

People are dying!

The public are
demanding answers!

I can't tell them
a vampire did it.

And it would be great
if I could have you

and your resources available

to help me find
out who did.

Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.

Thank you.

So what now?

Well, you said you found some
saliva in the blood sample.

You found something?

We're talking miniscule traces.

I missed it on
my first two passes,

so I can understand why
you guys didn't catch it.

Still, it could be something.

And if it's our killer's saliva,

it means that
he could be interacting

with his victims in an up close,
possibly fetishistic way.

Anything we can
glean from that?

I don't know.
What do you think?

Could you two compare notes and
tell me if you find anything?

Yeah, we could do that.
Of course.

Yeah.

I'll do a little more
research tonight

and drop off whatever
I have in the morning.

Yes, which reminds me, I've got
a couple more bodies to look at.

I'll probably be there
well into the morning.

All right, I'll be on my way.

Good luck.

No. Let's find a more nurturing
way of saying goodnight

like "I'll see you later."

Bye.

What about you?

It's late.
I should go check in on Mina

as I made an unceremonious exit
from dinner with her guest.

In the chaos of everything,

I didn't even get a
chance to ask about that.

Sounds like things are
going well for her with work?

Yeah.

She landed a big client,
a foreign aristocrat type.

He's looking for
property in the city.

It's a real boost for her.

You know how reserved
she can be.

That's great.
Yeah.

So long as I didn't
scare him away

when I ran out of the house
in pursuit of a murderer.

Well, I'd like to think
that's fuel

for a lively
dinner conversation.

No. He's a little posh.

Not the type
to want gritty details.

Well, I guess they can't
all be ghouls like us.

Guess not.

Jonathan,
we gotta find this guy.

Every day that passes while
we're grasping at straws

is another opportunity
for him to kill again.

I've always known you to be
a dedicated investigator.

But... and don't take
this the wrong way...

I can't help but feel
you're a little bit more

on edge about
this one than usual.

Our killer is singling out
women with specific attributes

and greeting them
with violence.

I can understand why that
would strike a nerve.

But as one of your
oldest friends,

I wanna make sure you don't
internalize this too much.

It wouldn't be good for you...
or the case.

It's a little too late
not to internalize it, Jonathan.

Someone is out there
othering women

and killing them
for their otherness.

For reasons of my existence,

I find that a little hard
not to take personally.

Of course.

Look at that saliva.

Get back to Jack with
anything you find.

I'm gonna go home
and check in on Mina

and go over all my documents.

All right.

You get some sleep, okay?

No more dead women
on my watch.

Got it?

Got it.

Mina?

Hey!

Amelia?

Baby.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

What happened?

There was someone in the house.

What?

Are they... are you?
I'm fine.

They got away, though.

My God, Amelia...

Shh. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here.

I don't understand.

Who did this?

It's him.

Him?

The Count said the papers
mentioned me by name.

What are you talking about?

The killer from my case.

He knows who I am.

And tonight he wanted
to send me a message.

He knows where we live.

Well, how did they get in?

Did they have a key?

And you're sure
you found no significant

evidence of forced entry?

No.

You know I know what
to look for.

And you know I have to ask.

I'm sorry.

It's just...
he came into my home.

What if I hadn't been here?

And Mina...

She's fine.

Not fine, but she'll be okay.

Just a bit startled.

It's gonna be a rough night
sleep for both of us.

Understandable.

Did you at least get
a good look at him?

No.

Credit where credit's due,

he knew to move fast
and stick to the shadows.

If I didn't know any better,

I would have thought
he was familiar with the house.

Is that possible?

Not likely.

Besides Jonathan Harker and a
few women from the social club,

we don't really have guests.

Though there was Dracula.

Dracula?

A foreign Count that Mina
is helping

acquire property in the city.

He was here earlier for dinner.

You don't think...

No.

Most aristocrats are not
known for their subtlety.

So I doubt a stealthy
breaking and entering

is in his repertoire.

I suppose you're right,

and he was vetted by
the partners in Mina's firm.

And kind of glad he's here.

It provides her
distraction from all this.

You don't have
to say it, Amelia.

I'm behind you.

You do whatever it takes.

Thank you, Captain.

Of course.

Well, I'm gonna
get these guys out of here

so you can get some sleep.

Are they gone?

Yeah.

The last officer just left.

And?

And I wish
I had answers for you,

but I don't... not yet.

This isn't supposed to happen.

This shouldn't
be coming to our door.

I'm supposed
to take care of you.

Honey, you do take care of me.

But tonight...

Tonight, when danger came
looking, you chased it away.

You went straight into battle
without a second thought.

And that's the woman I know
and that's the woman I love.

Mina...

You take care of me, Amelia.

You do so much.

You take care of so many people.

Sometimes you need to
let me take care of you.

Baby...

Shut up and let
me take care of you.


Jonathan!

Are you here to see Amelia?

I haven't seen Amelia for a day.

But I heard what
happened last night.

And I just wanted to stop
by and check...

Oh, sorry. I didn't
realize you had company.

Oh, sorry, yes.

Jonathan Harker,
this is Count Dracula.

We're currently working
together to, hopefully

find him a permanent
residence here in the city.

It's an honor
and a pleasure, Count.

And might I say,
with Mina here,

I'm sure you'll get everything
you want and then some.

The pleasure
is mine, Mr. Harker.

And on the subject
of Miss Murray, we agree.

She has been truly impressive.

The Count and I
are going to look

at a couple properties soon.

And there's an old Abby
on the Carfax which, I think,

with a little renovation, could
be quite a private residence.

I know the place.
It's spectacular.

Though isn't it getting a bit
late for property showings?

That's my fault, I'm afraid.

Much of my days are eaten up...

Business matters.

And so I had
to see it at night.

I'm a bit of a night owl.

Miss Murray was
incredibly kind to offer her

time out of regular hours.

It really was nothing.

Jonathan, why don't you go
and have a seat

and I'll let
Amelia know you're here?

Don't have to tell me twice.

So, you're a colleague
of Miss Van Helsing?

Yes, I suppose so.

Amelia and I have actually
been friends since childhood.

She used to keep me out of trouble and
I used to distract her from her studies.

Which is funny, 'cause now she's the
one always running towards trouble

and I'm the one who always
has his nose in a book.

Do you have an area of research?

I'm a chemist, actually.

I consult frequently
with Amelia and her colleagues

on cases of specific
scientific curiosity.

I do not envy
scientific research.

A lot of dry reading there.

I much prefer an evening sitting
with one of the classics.

I can appreciate that.

And definitely get the need
for more vibrant material.

The bulk of my personal reading
is actually into occultism.

How curious.

Does that study
not contradict

the steadfast rules
of your profession?

Not really.

In a lot of ways,
it informs it.

Sometimes folklore and
myth can fill in the blanks

when science can't.

I find that exciting.

I assume not all of your
colleagues share that sentiment.

Sadly, no.

But scientists who aren't
open to the unknown

aren't really all that good
of scientists, are they?

Hmm.

For someone I just met,

I must say you're quite
admirable, Jonathan Harker.

Thanks.

Amelia's just
finishing something.

She'll be right out.

Oh, great.

Thanks, Mina.
Shall we depart?

Yes, let's.
That'd be great.


I gotta get some sleep.

You know what?

Jonathan is quite good
at what he does.

Do you know that?

I don't give him enough credit.

There are some
interesting things.

I mean, it doesn't explain
you or the killer or...

Or why I'm talking
to dead bodies again.

Shit.

I should get myself
a small dog to run around here

or maybe a canary...

Wait a minute.


I thought we agreed
you were gonna cool it

with this paranormal
stuff for a bit.

He didn't have
a reflection, Amelia!

And?

And that doesn't concern you?

Especially based on lore
and what we talked about?

No!

Because I think you're seeing
things you want to see.

I don't want to see it!
I did see it!

You were on the couch, right?

Sit down.

If the mirror is at
an angle from where you are,

you can see me now, right?

Yes.

And now?

Jonathan?

No.

Exactly.

You were seeing ghosts and
ghouls where there are none.

You're right.
I'm sorry.

I just really want this
to go well for her.

It's the first time
I've seen Mina this excited

about anything.

That's true.

She did seem to have a little
more pep to her step tonight.

It's more than
just the work assignment.

Ever since Mina was younger,

she was bulled so relentlessly
for being different.

Whether it her hair
or the way she dressed,

she spent so many years
trying to change everything

about who she was to be who she
thought people wanted her to be.

And here's a circumstance

where she's being valued for
who she is and what she does.

Exactly.

I always knew she had
a tough time of it.

But I guess I never
really thought through

how those things
tend to hang on.

Be glad you never had to.

So you said
you dropped off some new data

to Jack on the way home?

Yes.

The saliva present in
the blood sample you provided,

upon further investigation,

showed the slightest trace
of a chemical anticoagulant.

Like a blood thinner?

Yes, more or less.

That would explain
the extraction of that amount

of blood without the body
attempting to clot to stop loss,

but that leaves the question:

how is the killer
administering it to his victims?

And where has
all the blood gone?

I don't know.

That's more your
and Jack's department.

I can identify the chemical,

but how and why of it
might be above my pay grade.

[phone rings]

Hello?

Amelia, it's Jack!

Speak of the devil.

No. Speak of the bat!

I have some very interesting
things to tell you.

When can you get here?

We're already on our way.
Excellent!

Seward?

Oh, Captain...

I got your message to come down.
What's going on?

Well, we had an amazing
development this morning.

From some of the blood
of one of the victims,

we were able to find
the presence of saliva.

And in the saliva,
there was an anticoagulant.

Okay.

Well, it reminded me something
that Amelia said.

Amelia said something
about animals and stuff

and I thought, well, there
are only certain animals

that have the anticoagulant.

And if you look here,
that would be bats...

Oh!


Why?


Jack?

Jack? We're here.

Oh my God. Jack?

Jack!
What happened?

Jack!

Get help!

Jack?

Re...

I don't understand!

Helps on the way!

Stay with me, Jack, please!

Please!

It was... Renfield.

Renfield!

Looks like
he's fled the scene.

Doesn't convince me
of his innocence.

What are you doing?
Isn't this a crime scene?

Yes. And if you recall,

I'm the lead
investigator on the scene.

And considering the fact
that we have a friend

in critical
condition downstairs,

I'm not inclined
to follow protocol.

So if you don't mind...

Locked.

Ah-ha.

What is this?

Oh, my God!

What?

These files...
they're records, passports,

Licenses,
personal information...

All of women matching
the killer's target type.

Red hair...
all women with red hair.

This doesn't prove
anything, right?

The captain of the police would
have files on murder victims.

Yeah, which is why
I recognize the first few.

The problem is,

a lot of these women
aren't victims... yet.

This isn't paperwork
after the fact.

It's a hit list!

Where are you going?
I'm going after him!

Amelia, look!

I understand, but
we should call someone

like Interpol or something!

Maybe, but we don't
have time for red tape.

Right, but...
Look!

Jack found something that
incriminated the murderer,

and Renfield tried
to kill him for it!

That tells me that
Renfield is either

the man responsible
or knows who is.

And every second we waste
puts someone else in danger.

I'll come with you.
No!

I'll check his house.

I may be able to reason with
him, but only if I go alone.

Take those files to your office

and see if there's
anything we've missed.

Amelia...

Be careful!

Renfield!

If you're gonna pull
that trigger,

you better be damn certain
you do it faster than I do.

Why'd you do it, Captain?

Your cover's blown.

At least help me understand.

You could never understand.

It is knowledge that is not
meant for the likes of you.

You attacked Jack...

and those women
are dead because of you!

You've perverted everything
we're supposed to stand for!

And what if everything
we stand for is irrelevant?

Because the truth
of what's really out there

is too terrible for
us to comprehend.

You're sick!

No, Van Helsing.

For the first time in my life,
I'm finally aware.

What happened to you?

The inevitable.

And it will
happen to you, too!


You told me to catch
the killer at any cost...

And I did.


Sorry, Amelia.

A familiar...

Of course!

Renfield's not the killer.

He's harvesting victims
for the killer.

I hoped I'd find you here.

Good guess.

Not really.

You're still the better
detective.

I tried your house first
and the station.

Finally, dispatch told me
this is where I should look.

They're not supposed to do that.

I'd like to tell
you some...

I killed him, Jonathan.

My own superior officer.

A man that I looked up to.

A man that I thought I knew.

What would bring someone
to do something like this?

He killed all those people

and came to work every day
pretending to look for himself.

It's deranged.

I think it's more than that.

What are you talking about?

I don't know that Renfield
was acting entirely

of his own accord.

You see, there's this
thing called a "familiar"

where a vampire entrances you...

Jonathan, I asked you...

I begged you not to go there!

Do you understand that
I had to kill a man tonight?

A man that I looked up to
and always trusted

to do the right thing.
It doesn't add up, Amelia,

and you're a good enough
detective to know that!

Renfield may
have attacked Seward.

But that in no way matches
any of the other murders.

It doesn't explain
the neck wound

or the anticoagulant

or what exactly Jack
found that set him off.

But the file...

Oh, I think
he's gathering a list...

for someone else,
someone who could tear throats

and make them bleed
without clotting,

someone who would gladly
take a tailored list

provided by the one person
who could give him one.

I just...

A tailored list that
includes the woman you love!

[bat screeching]


[muffled scream]

Seward stumbled onto
something that caused Renfield

to attack in a state of panic.

And that just
doesn't fit the pattern

up to this point,
and you know it.

Your killer's shown nothing
but cool calculation,

not to mention the fact
that you knew

the victim profile matched.

Mina.

She's gone!

Okay, panicking
won't help us find Mina.

We have to think
about this logically.

I just don't understand.

If Renfield's dead, that
means that you might be right

in the fact that
he could be providing

information to the killer.

Oh, my God.

That means that the intruder
that I thought was here for me

was actually here for Mina

because they know about her.

Why didn't you say
anything

about the fact she
matched the profile?

I didn't say anything because
I didn't think anyone knew.

She didn't want anyone to know.

When she was bullied
when she was younger,

they teased her
about her red hair.

That's awful.

She didn't want
to change her core.

But she could change
her hair and she did.

because it gave her that
small measure of control.

Jonathan, I have to find this
guy and I have to find him now!

Okay, but how?

Where do we start?

The crimes followed
a distinct trajectory

until Renfield was presented
with something

that spooked him enough
to deviate from the pattern.

Right.

And when he attacked Jack,
that cast enough

suspicion of guilt
in his direction

and I went after him
on intuition.

But that triggering evidence
is still out there

and could be the key, which
means we need to talk to...

Jack!

Jack, are you sure
you're up to this?

Oh, that's not the worst thing

that's happened
to me this evening.

Okay, so...

No, no, no.

The anticoagulant in the saliva,
it's not an external agent.

What I mean is,

whoever or whatever that
saliva belongs to,

they're biologically secreting
the anticoagulant themselves.

It's not a drug
or a stimulant

that they've purchased
and they've ingested.

It's literally
being manufactured

inside them naturally.

Is that something
people can even do?

Science would say no, but
there are specific animals

that can secrete
this anticoagulant

and yes, most of them are...
Bats.

like you said on the phone.
Exactly.

They secrete the anticoagulant
so that they can feast

on much larger animals
at will uninterrupted.

They slash the flesh and
then they have their fill.

And, uh...

Sometimes when the prey
is much smaller than them,

the end result is not unlike
our poor young ladies.

Okay, but...

Once I made
the saliva connection,

I did some research based on
the bite pattern on our victims.

And I was able to find a match.

And what breed of bat was that?

Oh, don't be so smug!

You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

Vampire.

Okay.

But there's no such thing
as a human-sized vampire bat.

Well...

There are centuries
of vampire myths and lore,

which our killer
could be relying on

to perpetuate his crimes.

And since you've been able
to look at this case

in a way I haven't,
I need to know what's next.

I...
I want to be clear.

I'm not saying that
I think it's a vampire.

But based on what we're seeing,

it is possible that he's
convinced himself that he is.

And he's using that illusion...

No. That would not explain
the presence of the...

The anticoagulant
in the saliva.

Exactly.

Yeah, but if I have to think
that way to get Mina back,

then I need to know what now?

Well, we'd have
to consult my texts.

Then that's what we'll do.

Jack, thank you.

Amelia...

Get this son of a bitch.

Bring her back.


Anything worthwhile?

I don't know.

Maybe.

At the very least,
I think I may have

fleshed out my theory
about Renfield.

You remember
how I said I thought

he might be a "familiar"?

Lore suggests that it's
a common practice

for the undead to entrance
a living servant

to provide them with
what they need,

often unbeknownst to
the entranced themselves.

Doesn't make me feel better.

Well, what it suggests is
that whoever's behind this

knows exactly
what they're doing.

Not only were they able to
get a direct bead

on potential victims
via Renfield's access,

but also who better than
the head of

the police department
to help control

the tide of information
about the case?

Credit where credit's due.

And if that's true,
that means they were able

to bring the papers on
a wild goose chase

about this
being a copycat killer.

Well, I mean, it makes sense.

What better way to
misdirect than point everyone

in an absolutely
preposterous direction?

Right.

Unless...

Unless?

Unless that's exactly
what they want us to think.

What if the best place
to hide is in plain sight?

Present something as impossible,
make it seem sensationalized?

And those who value the truth
won't even consider it.

And why would you think that?

Because I didn't.

And if this person
thinks they're a vampire,

they may also believe
that they're carrying out

the killings of
the original killer.

Or they think that they are
the original killer themselves.

You may be onto something.

Present something so plainly,

people dismiss it outright
for being too obvious!

Like how you and Jack
dismissed my vampire theory!

Okay. To be honest,
vampires as an answer

is the exact
opposite of obvious.

What are you getting?

Now I'm assuming,
because you're a good detective,

that even though you
dismissed it as a possibility,

you still looked into the
murders from a century ago?

The police reports
didn't have much, to be honest.

Something about a trail
of bodies and a land dispute

and the castle
outside the city.

It didn't make sense
to connect it to this case.

That's because you were relying
on fact and not on legend.

Now, I'm not overly familiar
with this particular story.

But I do remember some
of the broad strokes.

Something about a prince
or a nobleman

who absolutely lost it
on his wedding day

and went on a killing spree.

Kind of standard basis
of haunting stuff.

Oh, here we go.

I was right.

According to this,
an aristocrat was set

to be married to the love
of his life.

But due to an
unfortunate illness,

she died the same day
they were due to be wed.

How terrible...

Apparently, the tragedy
led him slipping

into a deranged madness.

And he started
lashing out and killing anyone

who reminded him
of his lost love.

I don't think
there are any photos.

But... the family name is...

Dracula.

Oh, wow!

I knew I didn't
see his reflection!

Amelia, you don't think...

Okay, all right.

There's no pictures of him.

But there is a painting
of his dead fiancÃ©.

We have to find Mina now!

We have to wait
until the morning!

Dracula will be
much weaker then!

I can't wait until then.

Who knows what will happen
to her if we wait that long?

Let's move.

Hotel Le Carmilla.

This is the place
Renfield had a key to.

I think this is it.

Maybe we should
call in backup.

Can't call in backup.

Besides, we're here based
on circumstantial evidence

of a giant vampire bat.

For some reason,
I don't think

they're gonna
spare the resources.

And what if we find him?

If Dracula is the descendant
of the mad aristocrat...

Or the aristocrat himself?

Then he's either finishing
the work of his family

or he knows who is.

Either way, that can
lead us to Mina.

So we're gonna go in there
and ask nicely.

And if he doesn't cooperate,
not so nicely.

That's what I was afraid
you were going to say.

I think it's this one.

I thought there'd be more
security or something.

Guards would draw attention.

This is exactly like the copycat
case, hiding in plain sight.

People won't suspect something
that looks totally normal.

But be ready when we
get in Dracula's room.


What do we do?

I don't know...

Amelia.

You're here.


Renfield?

That's impossible.


Hey! Put her down!


What is this place?

What did you do to these people?

You should never have
come here, Amelia!

I killed you once
and I'll do it again.



You were a good
detective, Amelia.

But chase death enough,

eventually you'll find it.

And now it's time to become

an officer of
a different rank...

Hey, Captain!


What was that?

Holy water.

Believe me now?


Blood!
They smell it!

No!
No, that won't work!

Here, hit their hearts.

Don't get bit!

Oh, is that all?


[bat squeaks]

Thank you, doctor.

[wings flap]

Hello?
Is somebody there?

Dr. Seward, I presume?

Yes. That's me.

It's a shame we should meet
under these circumstances.

As I've been told,
you're actually

quite a brilliant man,
unfortunately.

Brilliance is often
an impediment to what I do

and I don't like loose ends.



If you give me your blood,

I can give you pleasure
beyond your wildest dreams!


Jonathan!
Get clear!

Ah!

Are you okay?

Yeah.

You?

Yeah. I...

[bats squeaking]

You!

I could say the same.

Ah!

[groans]
Jonathan!

Where's Mina?

What did you do with her?

Miss Murray is no longer
your concern, Detective.

I appreciate you looked
after her all these years.

And for that, I had
considered letting you live.

But you have made
a pest of yourself,

killed my servant.

And that's not very
amenable to me.

Sorry to put a crimp
in your evening.

And I'm sorry
to put one in yours

but your interference ends
in my affairs tonight.

You surely must have known,

once you've
discovered the truth,

there'll be no going back.

A fact your dear Dr. Seward

unfortunately learned
the hard way.

Jack!

What did you do to him?

You already know the answer.

Now it's your turn!


So reliant on your toys.

I'm not like the others.

They were young, weak,

dependent on
the pitiful modernity

that's coursed
through their veins.

I am old, powerful,

enriched by
the blood of centuries.

It's foolish to think
that after all these years,

I'd give her up
to the likes of you.

You're him!

You're not a descendant.

You're the nobleman
whose fiancÃ© died.

I'm sorry for your loss.

But killing all those women
doesn't make you sympathetic.

It makes you a monster!

And it wont bring her back.

They're not her.

Mina's not her.

You can't cheat death.

Then explain me.



[wings flapping]

What are you going to do to me?

Do to you?

My dear, I've searched
for you across the years.

Now that I've found you,

why would I put
that in jeopardy?

You're not going to kill me?

Not yet, and not permanently.

But the others...

Pale imitations that
tarnished your legacy,

cruel reminders of
what was no longer.

They had to go.

But you... you stand apart,

a mirror's reflection
of the woman I know,

the woman you are.

Of all of them, only
you are her exact likeness.

When I saw you, I somehow knew,

but I had to be sure,
needed to see for myself.

Luckily, the partners
at your firm obliged.

It was all a lie?

It was a necessary means
to find the truth.

You may not remember
who or what you are...

but you will.

No... No.

I've been so very patient,

but it is time
our courtship ends.

There's only a few more hours
left of night you will rest.

And before the sun rises,

I will restore you to be by
my side once again forever.

But for now...

my dear Miss Murray...

sleep.

Jonathan?



Jonathan...

I'm okay. Oh!
All right, maybe not.

We need to figure out
our next steps.

I just don't
know where to begin.

That's because you
are relying on fact!

And not on legend..

They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

You've got to admit, a
century-old mass murder case

that ended at a creepy castle,

that's the kind of stuff that
whets the appetite...

The castle...

We should get help.

No. We can't wait that long.

We have to find her
before he does

whatever he intends with her.

My study. We can get
everything we need there.

It's all right.

Which way?

There should be a staircase off
the main chamber that leads...

[bats squeaking]

You shouldn't have come.

While I admire your conviction,

and am impressed that
you survived our meeting

earlier this evening, know
that it will not happen again.


Do you...
I see them.

It's pointless to resist.

You're profoundly injured,
Mr. Harker.

And, Amelia, my dear,
your blood betrays you.

If you are so sure, come and
fight me yourself, you coward!

Such taunts are beneath you,
Miss Van Helsing.

And I grow tired of
your distractions.

Where's Mina?

She was yours.

Now she's mine.

Then again, she always was.

Time to let go.

Of course, I'm happy to help
with that process.

Finish them!


Don't let him get away!
I'll hold them off!

I'm not leaving you!
Go!

Come and face me, you monster!







Mina?

Mina?

Baby, it's Amelia.

Mina...

Mina?

Mina, wake up!

Oh, thank God!

I'd ask that you refrain from
using that name in my house.

Don't you think
we've had enough

of this charade,
Miss Van Helsing?

It was a noble effort, but now
it's time to accept your defeat.

Like you did?

You stalked across a
century, maybe even more,

looking for your love lost,

killing every woman
that resembles her

only to kidnap the woman
that I love

in some deluded desire
that, what?

She's the reincarnated
version of your fiancÃ©?

And you have the audacity
to tell me

I don't know
when to give up?

You dare speak to
me with such insolence!

Jonathan!

Your insistence on
interrupting

when I'm speaking
to Miss Van Helsing

has grown tiresome,
Jonathon Harker.

I would urge that you
learn from your mistakes...

if it weren't your last.


What did you do to him?


We have done that
already, remember?

Stop!

Mina, no!

Mina...

Let her go.

Please, if you let her go,
I'll stay with you.

You'll stay
with me, regardless.

Maybe.

But I'm telling you,
if you let her go,

it would be
because I chose to.

Me.

And I know that there's a
part of you that wants that,

to know that I chose you, too.

I'm not interested
in bargains.

You know very well that
I can make you choose me.

I do.

But I'm telling you
I'll do it willingly

before you turn me
into what you are.

And while I still have
a will of my own...

I will stay with you.

I'll be her.

You are her!

You are my wife!

Actually...

I'm her wife.


Amelia!

Amelia, how are you?
Baby?

Are you okay?

I'm supposed to be rescuing you.

Fools!

I will kill you both...



Jonathan? Jonathan?

Are you okay?

Well, I'm alive.


Let's go home.

Can we just stop a second?

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Well, no, actually,
no, not at all.

I just wanna see it.

Do you really think
he thought I was her?

I think he hoped so.

Love makes us hope
for impossible things.

Well, he was an
impossible thing.

Makes sense
he'd believe in another.

So it's over?

You saw him burn into
dust just like I did.

Well, there are
certain blood rituals

one could use to resurrect...

Not today, Jonathan,
not today.

Do you think Jonathan
will be okay?

Thee doctor's said they need
to keep him for a few days.

I think it'll be slow-going.

But if I know Jonathan Harker,
he'll bounce back.

I hope so.

He will.

He just needs time, and rest.

We all do.

Speaking of, when are
you coming to bed?

I'll be there soon.

Good.
