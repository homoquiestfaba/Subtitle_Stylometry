(magical music)

(suspenseful orchestral music)

(wolf howls)

(suspenseful orchestral music)



Sign here.

I'm gonna need that scarf girl.

And you're gonna have
to lose those hoops.

Any other piercings
or body jewelry

they can get a hold of?

(suspenseful orchestral music)

Mm hm.

(buzzer buzzes)

(bell dings)

(door creaks)

(siren buzzes)

(door creaks)

(inaudible chatter)

Stay behind the yellow line.

(inaudible cackles)

(door creaks)

(inaudible cackles)

Hello baby, do you
like it long and hard?

(laughs maniacally)

I am hot and fresh for you.

(laughs maniacally)

Don't make eye contact.

Get me out of here,
I'm not a whore,

I just needed the dough.


This way.

Hey man, you want
to get baked man?

(laughs boisterously)

Hey Mary, how would you
like to get yourself sticky

with a little cream puff?

(laughs deviously)
(Clarissa gasps)

Damn.

(laughs deviously)

I can smell your muffin!

(Clarissa groans)
(laughs deviously)

(electric buzzes)

Good evening.

I'm ok.

(suspenseful music)

Good evening.

Mr. Gingerdead Man sir,

my name is Clarissa Darling.

May I have a word with you, sir?

May I see your
credentials please?

Certainly.

(suspenseful music)

Closer please.

Closer.

Still not close enough.

That's a library card.

Mr. Gingerded Man sir,

I've been sent here by the FBI.

Tell me Clarissa,
when you were running

down the hall just now,

that little cream puff, he
shouted something at you.

Tell me, what did he say?

He said,

"I can smell your muffin."

(Gingerdead Man inhales sharply)

I, however, can not.

I do however, smell
the faint undertone

of vanilla scented skin cream,

and that pimento loaf sandwich

that you had for
lunch, but not today.

I am putting
together a case study

on just what it is that
drives you to kill sir,

if you are willing to
cooperate in my investigation,

the DA is willing
to cut you a deal.

Candy Land Island.

Just off the coast
of Lolipop Bay.

Everyday, for three hours,
you will be permitted

to go outside into
the fresh air.

You will walk on the
brown sugar beach,

you will swim in
the lemonade ocean

under (sighs) SWAT team
surveillance of course.

Will I now?

Come, come Clarissa,
let's not play games.

Do you honestly
think they can send

some rookie in here
to try and unlock

the complicated secrets of my
brilliant sophisticated mind?

(farts loudly)

(laughs gleefully)

What are the ingredients
that drive you to kill?

(buzzer buzzes)
Huh?

all side chief personnel,

there's been a security breach.

We have been infiltrated by
misguided animal activists.

All personnel are to evacuate
the premises immediately.

(Gingerdead Man gulps)

(door clanks)

Oh my God, the horror!

What the fuck?

(background clatters)

(laughs evilly)

(chuckles gleefully)

You hippy mother fuckers
can't be up in here.

Yo Ezekiel, release these
imprisoned creations of God.

(club bangs)

Yea, run chipmunk.

Run muskrats!

Sugar gliders be free once again

from the horrors
of intersection.

(glass crashes)

Sweets for the sweet,
hey Gingerdead Man,

there is no FBI case.

You posses the soul
of my homeless brother

and drove him to kill himself.

Now I'm here to even the score

you little half
baked piece of shit.

No!


(gun fires)


Go be free!

(groans vigorously)

Oh my God!

Look what they've done to you,

they've shaved your body

and your little
jelly bean buttons.

Oh they've cut off
your noble (mumbles).

Don't you worry, I'm
gonna get you out of here.

(Gingerdead Man groans)

Be free, be free little
capuchin monkey, be free.

Run, run as fast as you can.

No, you don't understand!

(nose pops)

Fuck you!

I'll kill you...

[Gingerdead Man]
And fuck you too!

Do you understand
me Mr. Gingerdead Man?

(screams painfully)

I'll kill you if it's
the last thing I do,

I will track you
until the end of time!

Oh, shit!

(screams horrified)

(tiresome gasps)

Gotta haul ass.

Where am I?

Well fuck me to tears,
looks like I'm toast.

There he is!
(gun fires)

[Gingerdead Man]
Mother fucker!

This looks like fun.

(door creaks)

By Joe, I think we've got it!

This sustenance time machine

can actually send
simple food matter

into time and space.

Soon, hunger as we know it
will be eradicated, forever.

Just think of it,

a loaf of bread with an
expiration date of 100 years!

(laugh gleefully)

[Gingerdead Man] Too
bad your expiration date

is right fucking now.

(gun shots erupt)

(laughs evilly)

Woo!

Open the door, you
little fucking fruitcake.

I'm gonna knock that ass out.

Hurry up open the
door, I can't wait

'til I'll be able
to bust your ass.

(Gingerdead Man groans)

(door breaks)

Freeze you little
fun sized fucker.

Oh?

Sorry brown sugar, I'm
gonna have to catch you

some other time!

(laughs evilly)

(electronic swirls erupt)

(Gingerdead Man screams)

(upbeat rock music)

(funky disco music)

(electronic swooshes erupt)

Huh?

1976?

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

Well, oh, I gotta
get outta here.

(Gingerdead Man
screams frustrated)

What are you do?


Look out, look out!

(chatters painfully)

(inhales sharply)

Oh yea.

(inhales sharply)

Oh yea!

Snowball!

Hey everybody, it's
time to switch it up!

Change partners!

(funky disco music)

Looking good PJ!


Oh yea, taking shit!

Hey, where are you going?

Huh?

Oh, pussy!

(funky disco music)

That twirls Epstien,

he's gonna skate in
the Olympics some day.

How do you know that?

Shut up Pickles!

He's waiting to ask Tammy
Pimento to marry him

until he wins a gold medal,

then he's gonna melt
the gold medal down

and make two matching rings,

so they can have a
white wedding on wheels.

Oh God, I'm gonna puke!

[Little Girl] Oh
shut up Pickles!

Oh, all right,
enough, get away!

Such a freaking fox.

Duh!

I mean, why else do you think
I'd be reigning roller queen

for four years in a row?

Are you ready to bring home
another crown tonight baby?


I think...

I'd like to peel off
those satin pants

and ball you in the
back of my Trans AM.

Ugh back off Epstein.

know you're my best girl.

Give me some loving.

Whatever...

you'll get your rocks
off after I get my title.

Tonight, it's my night.

And none of these
little rink rats

are gonna take my
crown away from me.

Well then I better make sure

you get what's rightfully yours.

If I do, then...

well.

(giggles alluringly)

(upbeat disco music)

Cunt!

Attention skaters!

Welcome to the fourth annual
Roller Boogie Queen Contest

here at Trixie's Roller Land.

(crowd cheers)

Is everybody getting down
and having a good time?

(crowd cheers)

Get out on the rink and
show us it's done Trixie!

(crowd cheers)

Oh children, I
think it's no secret

that my skating days
have come and gone.

And sadly, so have all of yours.

(crowd protests confused)

Coincidentally, on this day

of great roller
boogie celebration,

I have received a telegram
from the county tax commission.

There is a balance of
back property taxes

that is going to result
in me closing the doors

of the roller disco.

Uncle Sam can't kill disco!

(crowd yells agreeably)

We're not gonna
let a few back taxes

shut this place down!

(crowd yells agreeably)

You're right!

It would take exactly
$85,000 for that to happen.

Well if we all work together,

maybe we could raise the dough

and pay for it ourselves?

(crowd shouts agreeably)

I know!

Maybe we can hold a roller
disco bikini car wash

in the parking lot tonight!

(crowd cheers)

Oh, that'll help.

Oh, oh, oh, I know!

We could have a roller
boogie bake sale!

(crowd cheers agreeably)

Surrounded by idiots!

Bake sale, here we go again!

Whoa!

Please, while I appreciate
your generous selflessness,

there's nothing I can do.

Let's just turn those
frowns upside down

and keep on trucking!

(crowd cheers)

Little Angel!

Huh?

Get that mirror ball
spinning white hot!

If this is gonna be the
final roller boogie contest,

let's make it the best one ever!

(crowd cheers)

Oh, and one more thing
before the festivities begin.

I'd like to introduce you all,

to my pride and joy,

my lovely niece Cherry.

She's come here
to help me pack up

what's left of my dream.

Please embrace her and
make her feel welcome,

she's all I've got
left in this world.

Say hi Cherry, don't be shy.

Hello.

(crowd greetings erupt)

Isn't she a delight?

Nerd!

(light shatters)

(ominous music)

And don't forget
to cast your votes

for the final
roller boogie queen

with our very own rink
manager, Miss Ingrid Harshman.

(crowd cheers)

Now let's roller boogie!

(crowd cheers)

(funky disco music)

(eerie violins snap)

(funky disco music)

(laughs boisterously)

(groans frustratedly)

Come on, why isn't this
stupid fucking thing working?

Get me the fuck outta here!

Oh come on!

(whimpers frustratedly)

Dynamite!

Huh?

Asshole!

Of all the shithead
decades to get stranded in.

(funky disco music)

DJoreen, Sandy, it's
time for the big car wash!

Oh ok Connie!

We're gonna do what?

(girls squeal)

I'm gonna get you both wet!

(girls squeal)

Oh, whoa!

I'm gonna hose some hoes!

(girls squeal gleefully)

(groans pleasurably)

Nice rack!

Well as long as
I'm stranded here,

might as well roll a few heads!

Woo hoo!

Where's the cigarette machine?

Hey Peaches, happy last
night of Boogie Land.

Right back at your Peej!

Oh my God, Tux look!

What?

My mood ring, it says
that something epic

is gonna happen tonight
that I'm never gonna forget.

Duh!

What's that?

I call it Tux's
magical trail mix.

Shrooms, loods, acid, ecstasy,
bennies, and nose candy,

if we gotta say
goodbye to Boogie Land,

I say we cannonball
it to the max.

Count me in!

Ok, what should we
start with first?

How about a couple of these?

Let's get it on.


(laughs playfully)

(upbeat disco music)

Randy.

Randy, this is my
precious niece.

She'll be helping us
close the place this week

and I thought maybe you
might show her around.

Sure thing.

Hi, I'm Randy.

She's Cherry, and I'd
like her to stay that way,

so if it's not too much trouble.

Yea, yea no problem.

I was gonna take a
break in a minute

and I was wanting to know

if you wanted to go for
a spin around the rink.

Oh no, Cherry isn't interested
in skating, are you dear?

Oh, she'll leave that to you.

Well, maybe, I think I...

Now, now, you're far too
clumsy for that my dear.

She's got a one way ticket to
becoming a dental hygienist,

don't you?

I don't know, I think...

Molars not rollers!

If I could just...

Drills not thrills.

But I just want...

Cavities not depravities.

Ok.

All right then,
that's settled.

I don't think it
would be a problem.

No skating!


Oh, I will be in
my office packing

if you kids need anything.

Remember...

No skating.
[Randy] No skating.

Promise?

Yes Aunt Trixie.

You two have a
wonderful night.

(suspenseful violin notes)

Ah come on, how about just
a quick spin around the rink?

Are you crazy, I couldn't.

You heard her.

Besides, I don't even
know how to skate.

Yeehaw!

There he is!

What?

That little man, he
was right over there.

Little man?

Yes, he was
running right over...

There couldn't possibly
be a little man

running around in
here could there?

Maybe I'm...

a little more jet
lagged than I thought.

I know what it is.

You do?

Yea, you just need to
blow off a little steam.

Here come on, I'll
show you, it's easy.

I'd better not.

Look how crowded
the dance floor is.

She'll never even see you.

Really?

(funky disco music)

Come with me.

(funky disco music)

Oh stop Sandy, you're
getting me all wet!

You know you
love it foxy lady!

(girls squeal)

Washing cars is fun!

Oh yea!

Oh let's do this.

(girls squealing delighfully)

(groans satisfactorily)

And after that, I'm
gonna buy 10 pet rocks

and Shetland pony named Bear,

then I'm gonna marry
a Bay City Roller.

Those guys are fags.

You ever say that
again, you can forget

watching me compete in the
battle of the network stars

when I'm a famous actress.

Ok, I'm sorry.

Can I ask you a question?

What?

Do you ever think we're
gonna be able to skate

without this stupid railing.

Of course we will.

A digital calculator?

We've been coming
here all summer.

Seems like we would've
learned something by now.

Be patient Pickles,
we're not gonna become

championship skaters over night.

We'll make our mark.

Everybody gets their turn
underneath the disco ball.

(electronic pulses swoosh)

(kids scream)

(upbeat disco music)

(Gingerdead Man chuckles)

Wrong exit baby!

You're soaking it in.

Huh?

Danger, hydro...

hydrochloric acid?

You bitches look so
hot, I almost can't do

what I know I'm about to do.

(laughs evilly)

Almost!

(upbeat disco music)

Here come with me.

I can't, we shouldn't
be doing this.

Take my hand.

You can do this, all right,
you should be dancing.

But my aunt!

Take a chance on me.

(funky disco music)

Oh my God, Tammy you
look so beautiful tonight.

I've never seen
anybody skate like you.

Fuck off lady.

(funky disco music)

(all cheer)

(jazzy disco music)

(girls squeal delightfully)

That's it!

(girls giggle)

(ominous music)

(Gingerdead Man
giggles maniacally)

(girls squeal delightfully)

How much money have we raised?

Oh let me check.

$2!

What?

How many cars have we washed?

One!

Yea and it's Trixie's!

(girls laugh gleefully)

Some hose for the hoes.

(laughs maniacally)

That's it, let it wash over you.

(girls squeal delightfully)

(ominous music)

(Gingerdead Man cackles evilly)

(girls scream painfully)

Great job!

Did I ok?

Heck yea, you're
a super freak.

Thanks.

I'm gonna grab us a
couple cold Shastas.

Ok.


Way to go!

Yea, talk about
your fast learners.

Thanks.

I'm Coco.

And I'm Yoko.

I'm Cherry.

You've got the moves woman.

Yea, and it looks like
Randy's got his eye on you.

Me?

Oh no, someone as perfect as him

would never go for
someone as plain as me.

Are you kidding?

He's dated some real
pigs in his time.

Um hm, you're
exactly his type.

All you need is a little
disco dust to fix you up.

What do you mean?

boogie makeover!

Come on!

When we're done with
you, you'll be crowned

the last Roller Boogie Queen.

Really?

Uh huh.

Maybe it's true what they say

about saving the best for last.

'Bout time we got some
new blood around here.

(Cherry giggles)

If it's new blood you want,

well then it's new
blood you'll get.

(girls scream painfully)

(Gingerdead Man laughs evilly)

(girls scream painfully)

(skin sizzles)

Ah, the smell of
womanhood and melting flesh.

(girls squeal gleefully)

(upbeat disco music)

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

* Uh huh

(girls squeal joyfully)

You look like a
roller disco diva girl!

Yea, now let's go out
there and get you that crown!

But my aunt...

We'll surprise her
with the new you.

Now, go ahead, turn around.

(girls scream excitedly)

I'm a stone cold fox!

(girls scream joyfully)

(static buzzes)


That was weird.

Hey, you guys are right,
let's get outta here

and go skate.

Ok.

(ominous music)

(Gingerdead Man
laughs victoriously)

Crack myself up.

Well better get outta here
before the fuzz gets here.

(groans with struggle)

Wee!

(trippy rock music)

Oh my God, the
colors are so colorful.

I'm tripping my
brains out Peaches.

Make love to me now.

Ok.

Maybe we shouldn't

all the melting water
color ballerinas

and flying aquatic
creatures might see us.

(chuckle impaired)

Sh, Peaches.

I think this demon
has risen from Hell

and it's headed
right towards us.

Let's go hide in that
magical cave over there.

Yes, quick!

We gotta turn invisible first.

Ok.

Come on.

Oh, oh yea!

Coming to cop a
squat honey buns?

Who's there?

Oh, come on, don't be shy,

bend over and show
me that big fat ass.

Where are you?

Take off your underpants
and strut around for me.

Oh, oh yea, pussy.

I see you.

(Gingerdead Man groans)

you peeping Tom.

That's it, come
a little closer,

I got a snack cake for ya'.

Oh, well, well, well,
what have we here.

Why don't you come on over here

and nibble on it for me.

(woman growls)

(Gingerdead Man screams)

Let go of me you fucking cunt!

you son of a...

(cookie snaps)

(screams painfully)

(celebratory orchestral music)

(upbeat disco music)

You look beautiful.

So do you.

Skate with me?

Uh huh.

Mm, I'm voting for her.

Yea, I'm picking that cherry.

Whoa, she cleans up real good.

Ow!

(slow jam music)

That little whore.

(faint taps)

(mic screeches)

Attention everyone.

I can't tell you how
it warms my heart

to so clearly see
you all down there

skating and having a good time,

even though some of you
made a distinct promise

that you would not.

And don't forget, you still
have five more minutes

to vote for the final
Roller Boogie Queen.

(papers rustle)

(playful music)

(toilet flushes)

Woo, Christ!

What's that broad
living on, sawdust?


I'm so busted.

I wanna thank you all
from the bottom of my heart

for giving this old
broad a wonderful life

and I can't wait to see
what's in store for all of you

once the music finally ends.

Cherry Wright to the
management office please.

Cherry Wright to the
management office.

She saw me!

You're all right.

(tense music)

(trippy rock music)

The walls are throbbing.

So am I butterfly.

(moans pleasurably)

(trippy rock music)

(ominous music)

[Gingerdead Man] Huh?

Oh!

(cackles ominously)
(suspenseful music)

(grunts with struggle)

Oh fuck.

Nice view!

(laughs evilly)

Woo hoo!

(upbeat disco music)

* I'm gonna disco you to death

* Kiss you at the moment

(knocks at door)

Yes?

You wanted to see me?

My, my, my don't
we look festive.

The roller girls
gave me a makeover.

Well, aren't they
the lucky ones.

Sit.

(grunts pleasurably)

It's synergy baby, come
on hammer me, hammer me, oh!

(grunts pleasurably)

What the hell are
you two doing in here?

Hi.

Yea, real high.

(trippy rock music)

You're sexy.

Yea.

What's up stud?

Looks like you two
could use some company.

Yea, come join us.

(groans pleasurably)

Oh yea, take it!

Oh God, and I
thought I was vile.

So, you think you can defy me

by painting yourself up
like a shameless trollop

and going out there and
making me look like a fool.

I'm not a trollop Aunt Trixie,

I was just skating.

Just skating?

Just skating?

Need I remind you that
you're sitting there

talking to a woman whose pelvis

is held together with
a screw and duct tape

because she was just skating.

You're a hypocrite!

If you hate skating so much,

then why do you own
a roller boogie?

Why you little bitch!

(Cheery yelps)

(women grunt)

Listen to me, they're
all gonna laugh at you.

They're all gonna laugh at you.

(Cheery yelps)

(women grunt)

(groans pleasurably)

Oh boy, if I had a
cock, I'd join in on that.

Oh yea, yea.

Looks like everybody around here

is looking to get nailed.

(groans pleasurably)

I think I can acomodate
them with that.

Yea that's it boys, hammer me!

Hammer me!

Your wish is my command!

Huh?

(nail gun fire erupts)
(laughs evilly)

Bye bye!

(laughs evilly)

If you build it, they will come!

Oh baby, I'm so high,
I can't feel my arm.

Feels so good.

[Gingerdead Man] Suck on this!

(laughs evilly)

(women groan with struggle)


(yelps out painfully)

Why do you hate skating so much?

What?

(harp music)

It was 1941.

FDR was in office and the
Japs were on a rampage

through out the Pacific.

While our boys had
gone off to war

to fight the good fight,

we girls stayed home
and did our best.

I'd been skating since I was kid

and I found myself more
comfortable on wheels

than I was on my own two feet.

It was about that time
the circus came to town,

and I found myself barrel
jumping to make ends meat

I was an instant senstation.

Before I knew it I
landed in the USO

performing for the troops.

The boys loved me,
especially FDR himself,

who invited me to a
special sunrise performance

in Oahu, Hawaii.

Everything was in place.

It was standing room only.

The sun began to rise behind me

as I took my position.

The crowd went berserk,
they were chanting my name

over and over as I
took a running start

and launched myself in the air.

(planes buzz)

It was about that time
the first bomb hit.

The barrels scattered
as hurled myself

across the marble patio.

And as I laid there
looking up all I could see

were the Japanese
zeros flying overhead.

I hit the ground like
a bag of wet cement,

shattering my pelvis
along with the dream

of a mighty nation.

(harps play)

What are you saying?

I'm saying that had I not
been performing that morning,

December 7, 1941, every
last one of those sailors

would've been manning
their battle stations

and Pearl Harbor never
would have happened.

So you see, that's why
you can't skate Cherry.

Not now.

Not ever.

I'm sorry about
your past Aunt Trixie,

I really am, but I
found my calling.

Your calling?

In four hours those doors
are gonna close forever.

I think we both know
what your calling is.

Wait!

Don't go.

Stay!

We'll burn that dress
and pray together.

I'm skating in that roller
boogie contest Aunt Trixie.

I'm skating, and
you can't stop me.

Cherry!

And I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

(ominous music)

(electricity crackles)

No problem.

(crowd chants)

Do a little dance,
make alotta love,

commit homicide tonight.


Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Harshman!

Attention skaters.


It's time to
announce the nominees

for this year's Roller
Boogie Queen Contest of 1976.

(crowd cheers)

Is it you Harshman?

(crowd laughs)

Who said that?

I'll deal with you
later buster brown.

Where the hell is my remote?

(groans frustrated)

(intriguing suspenseful music)

What?

(suspenseful music)

Pop goes the weasel!

(screams frightened)

(laughs evilly)

(tense suspenseful music)


Cherry!

You'd better get out
on the dance floor,

you never know.

(funky disco music)

I'd like to ask the
lovey young nominees

to please skate to the
stage to receive the honor,

and also to accept
the complimentary
roller boogie sash,

courtesy of
Joerski's fine meats.

Do I look all right?

Yea, you're one how twat babe.

Our first nominee...

is Miss Anne Morganstern.

(crowd whoops)

What?

(crowd cheers)

If you could step right.

Our next nominee, Miss
Betty Sue Richards!

(crowd cheesrs)

What?

(crowd cheers)

That looks beautiful on you,

it's styling, step back.

I don't think anyone's going
to be surprised at all,

on the nomination
of this candidate.

She's a real classy
lady, not to mention,

a dazzling crowd favorite,

our own little angle inside you,

the girl who's wheeled her way

into all of our hearts,
ladies and gentlemen,

please put your hands together

for the lovely Cherry Wright!

(crowd cheers enthusiastically)

What?

(celebratory music)
(crowd cheers)

Whoa!

(audience cheers)

Hi!

(audience cheers)

Hi!

Oh shit.

Oh and four time
winner Tammy Pimento.

(audience grumbles)

go Tammy, go Tammy!


Oh gosh, I told myself
I wasn't gonna cry.


First, I would like to
thank my Lord and savior

and I wanna let you all know,
it doesn't matter if I win,

it's an honor just
to be nominated.

Put a sock in it Pimento.

I will never
forget this night.

Beat it.

Oh yea, that's right.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to present

our Roller Boogie
Queen court of 1976,

here they are, give
'em a big hand!

(crowd cheers)
(funky disco music)

Congratulations!

(playful suspenseful music)

Go over there and see
who's gonna win that contest.

How am I supposed to do that?

I don't care what you
have to do, just do it!

Congratulations!

Thanks!

Hey can I talk to
you for a second?

Yea, sure.

I know you don't
know me very well,

do I seem weird to you?

No, why?

I'm right.

I am seeing something
running around this place.

Like what?


This is gonna
sound really stupid.

It's a gingerbread man.

(laughs skeptically)

A gingerbread man?

(Gingerdead Man
laughs maniacally)

Oh! Time for more fun!

Oh, oh!


He?

It was.

It leaped out at me from
behind those boxes right there.

A gingerbread man?

I believe something
jumped out at you,

I mean maybe it was
a rat or something.

Or maybe somebody drugged you?

Or not?

Ok.

How about we both just
keep our eyes open?

(suspenseful music)

(laughs maniacally)

Well that was
certainly no surprise.

Oh!

It's all very exciting.

Uhm, would you excuse
me for a moment?

Well certainly my dear.

(upbeat disco music)

(playful mysterious music)

She's gonna win.

What?

By a landslide.

That's not possible.

Oh it's possible babe.

See you only got three votes,

so counting you,
me, that means PJ's

the only other one
that voted for you.

Son of a bitch!

That's it.

Go get a phone book.

Why?

(giggles eagerly)

'Cause we need
to find ourselves

an all night pig farm.

Huh?

Oh!

(laughs nervously)

(suspenseful music)

(man screams painfully)

(blood squirts)
(suspenseful music)

(laughs maniacally)


(upbeat disco music)

Hello world, I've arrived!

This is amazing!

(man screams painfully)

Help me, somebody
help me please!

(screams painfully)

(upbeat disco music)

Girl, he is so into you.

This night has really
been a dream come true.

Uh oh, here comes
your worst nightmare.

Hey there!

Oh my God Yoko, work it girl!

And Coco, you look...

Just like a Newbian princess

Tammy Pimento!

I'm Cherry.

Of course you are!

I love your hair, you
look fabulous tonight.

It's amazing how
popular she's become

since she's changed her
looks and personality.

Yea, she's really arrived.

You're such a great skater.

Your aunt must be
so proud of you.

It's just too bad
you didn't get here

'til the very last night.

Thanks.

May the best girl win.

Good luck.

Good luck, you're
gonna need it, nerd.

Where are you going?

Ah, my work is done here!

(laughs evilly)

Wouldn't want the
party to end too soon.

Time for a little
disco genocide!

(upbeat disco music)

Hey jive turkery!

It's time to crack the whip!

(funky disco music)

Better yet, let's
crack some skulls!

There you are.

I wanted to introduce you
to a couple friends of mine,

Tux and Peaches but I can't
seem to find them anywhere.

Randy!

Have you seen Connie,
Sandy, or Doreen?

No?

Hm?

This is weird.

Where is everybody?

(slow somber music)

What are you doing?

I can't do this.

They're all gonna laugh at me.

What are you talking about?

You're all gonna laugh at me.

This is a big joke on
the new girl isn't it?

Joke?

You're one of the best
skaters I've ever seen,

you're a natural.

I'm a freak!

There's magic spinning
from those wheels Cherry.

Randy, there's something
you need to know about me.

I'm different.

Yea, you are,

but you got it going on.

I've got nothing but an
aunt with a swollen eye

and a broken heart.

No.

What you have my
dear, is a gift.

(inspirational music)

(funky disco music)

Oh!

(laughs evilly)

Can I get a woo woo!


(inhales sharply)

Woo woo!


Woo woo!


Yea come on jive turkey...

This outta clear ya' out, ah!


Woo woo!

[Gingerdead Man] Oh,
there ya' go Hoover.

(inhales sharply)

(suspenseful music)

Wait for melt baby!

(suspenseful music)

(crowd protests)

(funky disco music)

Uh huh, uh huh.

Woo woo!

(laughs evilly)


(laughs joyfully)

Welcome to Saturday
night clever!

(funky disco music)

Man, Little Angel's really
tearing it up tonight.

She's like a rabid dog when
she gets in that DJ booth.

Cherry no.

I'm sorry I let you down
Aunt Trixie, you were right.

Oh no my dear, I let me down.

I let us all down.

Oh let's face it, I'm
a bitter old lush.

If I hadn't spent all
those drunken nights

up at the Indian casino, I
would still have the money

to pay the back taxes and this
place wouldn't be closing.

More importantly,
you'd have a place

to roller boogie forever.

Roller boogie?

But I thought...

Don't speak.

Forget what I said.

I was wrong Cherry,
you were right.

I've been a hypocrite.

But...

No buts.

When I saw you out there,

I couldn't help but see
a magical reflection

of my former self.

It was as if I was
looking into a mirror,

well that is before
the shattered hip

and the bankruptcy issues.

Excuse me boss,
I have something...

Not now Ingrid.

But it's really important.

I said give me a second
you horrible woman.

I want you to put
those skates back on

and get out there
and win that crown,

not for me...

not for you...

do it for those brave boys
at the bottom of the bay.

Thank you Aunt Trixie.

Now get out there
and roller boogie.

(inspiration orchestral music)

Miss Wright, I...

Yes Ingrid!

What is it?

What could possibly
be so important?

You have my undivided
attention, what is it?

I'm sorry to interrupt chief,

but it appears been
a triple homicide

in the janitor's sanctuary.

(suspenseful music)

(chuckles evilly)

Huh?

What's that queen up to?

(suspenseful music)

A wise guy!

(gasps horrified)

Oh my God!

Good God Ingrid!

What kind of monster could
commit such a massacre?

It appears they were murdered

while participating
in some sort of

a multi generational
menage trois.

Yes I can see that.

My God, would you look
at what's left of Buzzby?

Sweet Jesus, he was
hung like a Clydesdale.

Never mind, we must alert
the authorities immediately.

Yes!

And we will!

Just as soon as we crown the
final Roller Boogie Queen.

This night means the
world to my Cherry

and let's face it, they're
not going anywhere.

Yea, but boss...

No buts.

We will call for a
squad car the moment

the winner is announced.

Yes chief.

In the meantime,
you lock his place up

as tight as a drum.

And whatever you
do, act natural.

(sighs defeated)

(upbeat disco music)

All done!

Good boy.

Tonight, we're gonna
paint this town red.

With blood!

(laugh evilly)

(laughs evilly)

Be careful now!

Attention everyone!

The time has come
for the crowning

of our final Roller
Boogie Queen.

Will the nominees please step
up to the stage and join us.

I must say that this moment
is very bittersweet for me.

I hope you get it.

Thanks.

Wait (mumbles)...

Well, there they are skaters!

Please give it up for
our court of 1976!

(crowd cheers)
(celebratory regal music)

Aren't they lovely?

Thank you Ingrid.

It's such a special
night for me.

No matter the outcome,
to go out knowing

that my sweet Cherry
has made her way

into the winners circle
does my old heart good.

(giddily squeals)

And now the results!

(cheers erupt)

Not only will the winner
tonight be crowned

by our very own lady of the
court, Miss Ingrid Harshman,

but she will be
awarded with a special

fabulous gift package
containing cash and prizes

including a Mr. Microphone,
Ron Co's pocket fisherman,

a case of Gee Your
Hair Smells Terrific,

and a pair of delightful
rainbow toe socks.

Drum roll please.

(drums roll)

And the winner is...

Cherry Wright!

(cheers erupt)

(uplifting inspirational music)

(crowd cheers eagerly)

(suspenseful music)

(uplifting inspirational music)

(crowd cheers)

(suspenseful music)

(crowd cheers)

(suspenseful music)
(crowd cheers)

What are you doing?

see what's going on?

No I don't see anything
except you causing trouble,

now get the hell outta here.

(suspenseful music)

(rope snaps)

Whoa!

(liquid splatters)

(crowd gasps)

Yea!

(laugh gleefuly)

Geronimo!

(crowd screams)

(Cherry screams)

(laughs evilly)

Babe!

(knife squishes)

(laughs maniacally)

Night, night!

(gun shots erupt)

Congratulations Cherry,
it's all for you!

From the bowels
of hell itself.

It's a homicidal
confectionery treat!

Everybody run!

(gunfire erupts)

Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

Eat me!

I'm Gingerdead Man
at your service

my bicentennial bitch!

I hope all you mother
fuckers are hungry,

'cause it's time
for you to eat lead!

Oh my!

(gunshots erupt)

(screams fearfully)

(gunshots erupt)

(panics fearfully)


You know what to do.

You've always known what to do.

You have gifts that
go far beyond the
roller boogie, Cherry.

Use them now, use them as if
your life depends upon it!

As if it does?

(gunshot erupts)

Son of a bitch!

Now Cherry, kill that bastard!

(suspenseful music)

Sleep tight you little cunt!

(doors slam)

(suspenseful music)

spinning from the wheels Cherry.

Bring it on crazy eyes!

Thank you!

You know, I always hated
Tammy, she was such a bitch.

I totally voted
for you, I swear.

(gunshot erupts)

Put a cork in it you whore!

Step right up, who's
ready for some more sugar?

Do something Cherry!

(suspenseful music)

Let's boogie down!

(electric explodes)

Fuck!

(electric static crackles)

(suspenseful music)

Pretty pity!

(laughs evilly)

(electric crackles)

Disco inferno!

(laughs evilly)

How do I look?

So cute.

Oh my God, what color
lipstick is that?

It's shocking pink.


Oh yea, totally.

(electric current buzzes)

Don't act so shocked!

(laughs maniacally)

Don't act so shocked, get it?

Is this a killer
night or what?

TGIF.

(laughs evilly)

Burn baby burn!

Bye bye!

(electric current sizzles)

Smoke if you got 'em!

(electric current sizzles)

I crack myself up!

(electronic current sizzles)

Get down!

(fires sizzle)

Suprise!

Don't even think of trying any

of that spooky horseshit
on me honey buns.

Looks like this will be a
1976 you'll never forget,

well that is until
I finish you off.

Gingerdead Man,

hold on to your cookies!

Oh shit!



This can't be good!

(electronic swooshes)

Tina Joerski, time traveler.

And trusty sidekick Pickles!

Shut up Pickles!

We're back from a little
trip through time.

Frontways and back.

Yea and uh, we've seen
all the trouble you caused.

Oh come on kiddies, I'm just
a friendly gingerbread man.

I wouldn't hurt a flea, now
give me back my water pistol.

Sit on it you cookie creep.

Oh shit.

Fun time is over.

We brought back a few friends
to help even the score.

Well bring it on you
little butt biscuit.

When I'm done with you,
I'll give you a tummy ache

that'll be legendary
even in hell.

We'll see about that.

Gingerdead Man, meet...

(electronic current buzzes)

(uplifting inspiration music)

Adolf Hitler.

(speaks foreign language)


Charles Manson.

(electronic swooshes)

Let's do something witchy!

Uh oh!

Jeffrey Dahmer.

(electronic air swooshes)

What's for supper?

Holy...

And Lizzy Borden.

(electronic air swooshes)

Might I axe what year it is?

(electronic swooshes)

And you do remember me,
Mr. Gingerdead Man sir?

Clarissa Darling
here, and sorry,

but none of us saved
room for dessert.

(clears throat)
How could I forget?

It's time for you to go home,

you crummy little bastard.

Check please!

(tense powerful music)

Kill him!

Now slow down, I can
explain everything.

You see my daddy didn't
hug me when I was little.

Oh no, what are you doing?

Oh no you assholes,
I'm warning you.

I'm warning you
bastards, put me down!

This is an outrage!

(protests fearfully)

I'm in the union,
I'm in the union!

Put me down, put me down!

No, no! Ah!

(screams painfully)

Yes.

(scream painfully)

[Gingerdead Man] Cookie Jar?

Not the cookie jar!

(screams panicked)

I'll see you all in hell!

[Little Girl] We did it!

You did!

You all did!

And I wanna thank
you all so very much

for saving the
day, well sort of.

I mean, it would've been
nice if you could've arrived

a little earlier.

Uhm, excuse me Miss Wright?

Yes dear child?

Don't forget, we
have a time machine.

But...

No buts.

I just went back in time
and warned Miss Darling

what was about to happen,

so the Gingerdead
Man never escaped.

And none of this
ever happened!

(all cheer)

(sparkles twinkle)

(uplifting inspirational
orchestral music)

(crowd cheers)

And by the way...

What's this?

A lottery ticket.

On the way back, we
checked tomorrow's newspaper.

Congratulations, you
are a millionaire!

And Roller Boogie
Land is safe!

(crowd cheers)

And disco will live forever!

Sure it will!

(crowd cheers)

Let's roller boogie!

(crowd cheers)

(upbeat disco music)

(air swooshes)

See, I told you
everyone gets their turn

underneath the mirror ball.

Mind if I hitch a ride?

But Aunt Trixie,
we need you here.

This is all yours
now sweet Cherry.


I have a little unfinished
business back in 1941.

Goodbye Aunt Trixie,

I'll never forget you.

Take care of each other,
and stay away from sweets.

Aloha everyone!


[Little Girl] All
right everybody,

you ready to go back home?

(air swooshes)

And behave yourselves!

Wee!

(laughs boisterously)

Calabunga!

(speaks foreign language)

Yea!

Peace out mother fucker!

Aloha!
