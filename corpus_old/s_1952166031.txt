I'm not career oriented.
Sure.

If I were a wife, I would
be called a housewife.

I'm good at doing this.
I take care of the house.

Just because we're adjoined at
one little part of our bodies...

doesn't mean we're
same person.

We're two separate people
with two separate identities.

We can come very
close to each other.

Or we can go way
apart from each other.

No! No! No!
Of course I've dated.

I'm normal.
Of course.

This is really sad.

No. This shit's a trip
if you ask me.

No. The fact that this
woman has 150 pounds...

of human attached
to her head.

And she probably has
more sex than I do.

It's an automatic two-fer.

You think one really just
sits there playing solitaire...

while the other one's
getting busy?

I obviously didn't think
that one through.

Where you going?

I'm taking Jane to dinner.

Man, you should just donate
that food to the homeless.

You'd get a lot more
satisfaction that way.

This may be hard to
comprehend, Lorenzo...

but some guys have to actually
work for a female's affection.

And that includes
paying for dinner.

It's a labor of love.
Jane's a sweatshop.

If she were to be told
today that she would get...

a million dollars to
do a naughty scene...

she would not do it.

Come on. She's not
exploiting me.

If you went to college and took
psych. I took psychology.

They say that once you get 26
you are over the hill.

Woman, you can
wait right here.

Finna commence the hostile
takeover of all y'all dividends!

Where's Simon?

Hell no! Don't tell me I'm going all in
with just you two motherfuckers again!

Don't tell me he's doing
the same old same old with...

that bitch!

So, Annette said she
saw Max eating sushi...

with one of his
groupies last night.

Firemen have groupies?

Yeah, they're called firehoes.

And I know this new one is
just trying to backdraft off...

my relationship problems with
Max to hook up with him.

You and Max broke
up over a year ago.

I ended it.
It was my decision.

It's just been so hard trying
to new guys in the city.

I mean the selection is so stale.

And between all the suits,
skaters, and indie boys...

there's just not much for a
girl to get worked up about.

Maybe you should
lower your standards.

Simon, he got that scientist
intellectual shine to him, right.

I mean his cerebellum
be swelling and all,

but he need to do some
research on his own self.

That girl got his brain
discombobulated, blood.

So are you seeing anyone?

No, not right now.

Well, why not?

How's the boy supposed to get shot
down if he just sits there idolizing?

Hey, man, why do you want
your boy to crash and burn?

Make a move and move on.
That's all I'm saying.

Trust me, I got
Simon's back.

Like a chiropractor!

Yeah, but how do you know
Jane is going to shut him down?

I just know.

Call me.

Man, this how players
smoke, all right?

It's hard to put 'em on
the line for a woman.

I did, and you all know
what happened to me.

Here we go again.

Yeah man, but look how
great you're doing now.

You're deejaying again.
You even you rushed that frat.

Yeah dog. Look. Look.
Pop the collar.

Hey yo. I fold.

There ain't no
flop yet, man.

I got pocket rockets!

I thought you kids
wanted to play cards!

I didn't know you wanted
to hold each other's nuts...

and love each other!

This is why you guys
fuck fat chicks! Fools!

You coming?

I am the man right now!

Somebody tell me
I am the man.

You're the man.

Trese.

Just checking up
on my babies.

You know, Simon,
it's really sad to see...

someone so desperate
for validation.

Simon, did you know
that men and mice...

are sixty percent
genetically identical?

Yes I did.

They grow up so fast.

The little ones reach their sexual
maturity after just one month.

After that they need
to be separated.

Because if you don't...

the brothers will start
mating with their sisters.

They don't care.

They just give in to their
biological need to reproduce.

It's kind of what men do when
they interact with women.

Maybe it's in your genes.

My roommate set me up
with this guy tonight.

You really let someone
fix you up?

Wow, it's so sad to see someone
so desperate for affection.

Yeah, well, this guy didn't see
tonight as a chance to meet.

For him it was just an
opportunity to mate.

A man's brain is 3000 times
bigger than that of a mouse...

and yet it works
exactly the same.

You're a genius, Trese.

Well, I'm an expert at
categorizing mice

which means I can do pretty
much the same with men.

Do you have me
categorized?

Well, from my observation...

you are in the same category
as the guy I got fixed up with.

And what's that?

Guys who are getting
no action tonight.

It's not by circumstance.
I'm here by choice.

Bye Simon.

I'm here of my
own free will!

Trese, don't tell me you cut out
of another date...

to write one of your poems.

I thought we decided you
needed to socialize more.

When creativity hits you
just have to roll with it.

Is this another one
about the racist,

misogynistic, exploitative,
capitalistic society that we live in?

The struggle continues.
Let me see that.

Give it back!

"I am I am I am nothing".

"Not a color.
Not a curve".

"Kissed all the
girls but me".

Wait. I'm not finished.

"And then I turned around and
God her hair was on fire".

"She walks alone. You tell me
I am not that she".

"I say I am, I am, I am".

So who's the guy?
There is no guy!

Really?
There's no guy involved?

Okay I lied.
There is a guy.

I knew it.

Name.
Simon.

Story.

Girl likes boy. Boy likes
someone else. The end.

Go! Go! Go!

Amen!
Amen.

Coach!

I'm sorry I missed
that last shot.

Oh, don't blame yourself.
It's god's fault.

Huh?

Um, don't we thank
Him when we win?

Yeah.

Okay, well... if he gets the
credit when things go right...

shouldn't he take the blame when
things don't work out for us?

Okay, why don'tyou
just go reflect on that?

Simon!

Another late night, eh?

You've got to pace yourself.
You're going to be here for a while.

You see that, Gilly?
In two more months...

my signature will be accompanied
with the letters P-H-D, my friend.

You know, I spent the best years
of my life fondling a microscope...

and there are two things that
kept me from going insane.

One of them is knowing
that every grad student...

is going to share the same
shitty existence as me.

So you can't tell me you're going
to be out of here in three years.

You haven't even
paid your dues yet.

Two years.

Whatever.

What's the other thing that
keeps you from going crazy?

Her.

Trese?

You ever notice her?
No.

No?

I got your test
tube right here.

Hey.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing?

What up Si Guy?
What're you doing here?

Check it! Covonne's spinning
at a party this Saturday.

Frat house!

Now what we need to do is we gotta
start rounding some people up.

Hey, is it cool
if I come?

Damn girl! Game on!
Oh hell no! Game paused!

Hey guys!

Harlen!
Yo, what's happening, man?

You're blowing up all
atomic like there, dude.

Yeah, you heard of the afro?
Well, this is the anglo. You like?

You can bounce a quarter
off this shit. It's great!

Damn, I gotta get
me one of those!

Shit cost me two bills.
You like it?

It makes a statement.

Yeah, it says, "Since I can't
hold a permanent job,

keep a permanent girlfriend"...

"well then, fuck it!"

"At least I can give
my hair a permanent".

And if I don't like it, it will
wear off in a week and a half.

That's good.
Word.

I hopeyou don't mind,
I brought my boy Riles.

That's fine.
Take it easy.

I gotta go make
my move.

He's nice.

You think that would look good on me, man?
Right on top of the dome and all.

Yo, howyou be
activating that?

Is that top made
out of mesh?

Looks like
oranges in socks.

Happening party. I never come
to a party empty-handed.

The hell is this?

Page 43. Last year's draft.
Twelfth round. Fullback.

Grant Riley aka. Riles.

Right there.
That's me.

Autographed.

Wow. So you actually
play professional ball?

Well, not since I got cut...

But I'll be back on thefield, and you guys
will be, like, "I know that dude. Whoo!"

You want one too?
I got more in the car.

Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.
You sure?

We'll share it.
Thank you.

Who brings this to a party?
Score!

Hey!
Hey!

Who's the big guy?

His name is Riles. He's some
meathead that came with Harlen.

What do you have to drink?
Right here.

You're the only guy that I know...

that carries a mirror
around in his front pocket.

That's so you can
see yourself anytime.

I know.
It's comforting.

Thanks.
Uh, yeah. You're welcome.

Yo. It's the revolutionist
party leader himself.

What? Not enough people?

Look, man, we did what we could
on short notice. All right?

You brought alcohol!

Yeah I brought alcohol,
and I had to buy it myself.

What kind of fraternity doesn't
have something to sip on?

It's not that type
of fraternity!

What type of frat house is it?

It's a House of God!
What have you done, man?

House of what?

Lorenzo?

Anita.

You're the last person
I'd expect to see here.

Yeah well, you know... ain't no party
like a Holy Ghost party, right?

So what did you do in a
past life to end up here?

This is Paul's old
stomping grounds.

He was Aota-Lota-Mu's
first president.

Oooh...
Paul! Lorenzo. Lorenzo. Paul.

Hey.
Whoa! Hey, tiger!

Lorenzo.
Yeah.

Are you here
to embrace Christianity?

Good... Can you believe
this turnout, huh?

I mean it's... uh,
it's of biblical proportions.

I knew it was only
a matter of time before...

people began to accept
the word of our savior.

I'm glad you're here.

I'll get you a fruit punch.
No, I'm getting you fruit punch.

Yeah, praise the Lord.

After me, you settled for
the founding father of this?

Oh! Nerd alert!
What? Hello!

Come on now! If you can shake it
in the club, you can shake it for Jesus!

Now, two of these girls,
they used to fight each other...

and slap and stomp
all the time!

Now they're slapping
and stomping for the Lord!

Let's give it up for T-L-L!
The Lord's Ladies!

"He's got a plan.
I know it's hard to understand".

"You ready to praise him? Come on.
So you gotta praise him".

"When you ask him.
You better thank him".

"You stick around.
He will never let you down".

Mother of Jesus.

Joseph, baby, momma.

That's enough.

Stop it! Stop it!
What're you doing?

You look like a
fucking retard!

You joined a
fucking cult?

No, it's not a cult! I need
some direction in my life.

And don't try to make
this a religious thing.

Simon coaches basketball
at a Catholic school.

He's not even Catholic, and you're
not on his case about that!

Simon's just doing
that to impress Jane.

He's not looking for a path to salvation.
He's looking for a path into her pants!

This isn't about that girl that
broke up with you. Is it?

No.

I don't know.

Hey!

Hey. I feel you, man.
I do. I really, really do.

But do you really think, that God
is gonna get you get laid?

I don't know
what to do anymore, man.

I think you do.

This shit right here is dangerous!
This shit right here will fuck you up!

This shit right here
is not to be touched!

But still the party people
just can't get enough!

This is my song!

Come here girl! You know
you want to freak me!

What actually got me first
noticed by the big boys was

I actually have an extra
muscle in my right arm.

Shut your mouth!

Yeah. Scientists said it was some kind
of deformity but what do they know?

Yeah. Nothing.
Let me get you something to drink.

Hey!
Hey!

Gilly mentioned a party. I thought
I'd just come and make an appearance.

Are you having a good time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Except this beefy guy kept
trying to talk to me.

I couldn't hear what
he was saying

but I think he was trying to sell
me a magazine subscription.

She's beautiful.

Oh, yeah.

It's not like that. That's Jane.
We're just friends.

So have a good time.
Yeah. You too.

So I see you met Riles.

Oh yeah. He
is so yolked.

Did you know he was
in Sports lllustrated?

Yeah.

Did I ever mention that I had
two papers published in JAM?

Journal of American Medicine?

Yeah, but Sports lllustrated,
that's like a real magazine.

Lord have mercy!

Moses could not create
commandments

for the things I want
to do to you.

Take me to Sunday
School, girl!

I don't know what Jane saw
in that Riles guy anyway.

I mean, minus everything that was
anabolically enhanced. Come on!

So he's probably not hung
like a triceratops, right?

But more than likely
just as dumb.

Triceratops had a very
small brain to body ratio.

You know what Jane's
problem is?

You know why she wastes her time on
all these self-destructive relationships?

It's because she's like this Sports
lllustrated, she has a ton of issues!

Do you always have to think
like a fucking scientist?

You can't keep coming up
with theories to explain...

everything that happens
in your life.

You want to know why
Jane isn't with you?

It's because she doesn't want to be.
That's it. Leave it alone.

Okay, first of all.
I am a scientist.

And secondly, I'll promise
to stow my baggage

as long as you promise
to handle yours.

I don't really need any help.
I'm not really hurting for women.

That's weird, because we're sitting
at a train station in the rain

waiting for a girl that
you met in a chat room.

Oh yeah,
a chat room.

Have you actually seen
this girl in person?

What are you doing?

You just bailed, and she came
all the way out here to see you.

You're better than
that, Lorenzo.

Stop the car.
What?

Just let me out!

What are you
doing here?

I thought we agreed you
wouldn't come over like this.

I knew I shouldn't have said
anything to you at that party.

Just so you know, I am not going to break
up with Paul to go out with you again.

Well, what about...
Oh no!

I am not going to become
one of your poke pals either.

What do you see in this
afterbirth anyway?

You know it's
"born again".

And Paul has goals
and ambitions.

I have those
things too.

Really?

Lorenzo, what do you
wanna do with your life?

I wanna eat like a horse,
drink like a fish, and party...

Party like a rock star.
You always say that.

That's something a 16
year-old would say.

It's like you're eternally and
forever, forever, ever pubescent. Okay?

And I just can't be
with somebody like that.

Oh, okay, alright, so the truth
comes out.

You broke up with me because... you
think I'm not good enough for you.

No, that's not the truth.

Honestly, I broke up with you
before you could hurt me.

You have to admit, you've
always had a reputation.

You know what?
The next time Paul tells you...

how how nice you are or
how beautiful you are,

all he's doing is repeating
something a guy with no goals...

and a reputation
already told you.

Reputation or not, you were
always a gentleman to me and...

I never said goodbye.
You deserved at least that much.

Goodbye, Lorenzo.

So can I feel
you up?

Fucking idiot.

Guess not.

A laundromat?
Fifth Street Suds.

On top of a dryer.

You ever play a game of "hide the
egg roll" with a set of Siamese twins?

What kind of fucked up Ripley's Believe It
or Not backwards country bullshit is that?

I'm sorry. Is that a no?
Drink up.

I know you ain't freaked
a freak of nature.

Not yet.

Damn. Oh sugar!
Daddy be sprung!

Who be calling?

Yo! Yo! Yellow Fever Hotline!
This is Jimmy Dog your operator!

Can you hold for
a minute, girl?

What the fuck is
wrong with you?

I told you! Don't be bringing
that raspy shit in here!

Tellin' me when and where
we can conversate!

Usin' up all my peak
minutes and shit!

Siamese twins.

We ain't on no family plan!
You out of your damn mind!

This isn't a game, Jimmy!

I know it's not. Because with you, I'm
scrimmaging. You see that? That's right!

Gwen and Jimmy are at it again.
Even these don't help.

I don't understand why Gwen puts up
with Jimmy's fake-ass ghetto bullshit.

I don't know why
you put up with it.

I'm not a black in America
but for the love of god.

That's right.
You're not black.

Up until now, Jimmy put
the Asian in Caucasian.

I didn't see you get all
riled up about that.

Jimmy's not a
threat to me.

It's not like the kid's going to
inject my ass with syphilis.

Even if he is having
an identity crisis

I don't understand why Gwen would degrade
herself to put up with a fuck up like him.

I just don't understand
her thought process.

You always want what
you can't have.

Love makes you
dumb like that.

What now?
What is wrong with you?

I got nothing
to say to you.

Why don't you sit your ass down
like an Asian girl is supposed to?

We need to talk now!
You know what I think about that?

Oh what?
What's your problem?

After all Gwen does for you,
and this is how you treat her?

You better lean
the fuck back!

Don't be pressing your luck, Jeopardy Boy.
You about to get scrapped!

You're not gonna do anything.
Hey, it's all right. It's all right.

Get this motherfucker off me!

You're a joke.

Fuck you all!
I don't need this shit!

Jimmy, what happened?
Wiill you talk to me? Hello! Jimmy!

What are you doing?
God!

Hey, Sugar Tits.
You order food, you kinky bitch?

Just ignore it, Riles.

Jane!

Jane!

You're here late...
again.

Some plans fell through.

And before you can say
anything else, shut up.

Well, I don't have time to talk.
I have to go. What time is it?

Five past midnight.

Shit!
There goes my last bus.

I can walk you home.

Do you want to carry
my books too?

I'm just saying it's late.

A girl walking home alone in the city...
It's not safe.

Hey you!
Hey.

It's cold out here.
How's it going?

It's good.
You just missed the kids.

You know, I think it's sweet
what you do for those kids.

I bet you'll make a
great dad some day.

Personally, I don't think
I could go maternal.

Why?

I don't know.

Carrying something like this
around for nine months?

Like that's ever
coming out of me.

Let's go get some drinks.

There's a new bar in the Mission
that I really want to check out.

What about page 43?
Who?

Oh, you mean Riles. Whatever.
He is completely lame.

I would have
never guessed.

Do you know what
he said to me?

He said that he liked every
muscle in my body

especially his.
Can you believe he said that?

He's classy.

What is it with me
and guys, Simon?

Is there something
wrong with me?

No. There is nothing
wrong with you.

Come console me
over cocktails.

I can't.

I actually have
a date tonight.

Do I know her?

No. You don't.

Okay.

Simon?
Hey.

Come in.

Um, Simon, this is
Vivian, my roommate.

Vivian this is Simon,
my lab mate.

Nice to meet you.

The same.

Sorry I didn't call.
I don't have your telephone number.

Did something happen to my mice?
No. I don't think so.

I can see you guys are getting
ready to go somewhere.

I'll letyou guys go.

Well, tonight is Ladies Night.

Oh. Sounds exclusive.

Well, once a week, we
get together for dinner

and after that we do something
affordably metropolitan.

I actually have a
college buddy.

He and his fiancé have a
Date Night once a week.

They say it keeps their
relationship kindled.

I don't think what we do is
a Date Night, right Vivian?

Oh, right.

Okay.

Actually, you know, Trese, I'm not
really feeling up to it, tonight.

What?
Hey... Simon.

How do you feel
about Mexican food?

We're compatible.

Because Trese here is
dying to try this place.

It's not a life or
death situation.

I just opened up...
So Simon, are you in?

...Zagat's.

You don't have to.

But I'd like to.

Well, you two
should get going.

I can hear the
dinner stampede.

It was nice
meeting you.

Fuck.

See, this is real
Mexican food.

I went out with this guy from
the Biochemistry Department...

for Mexican food once.

He took me to Taco Bell.

Wow.

Yeah.

I can't believe you went out
on a date with a researcher.

Why is that so
unbelievable?

They're socially inept.

I mean, look at the
guys in the lab.

These guys spend every waking
hour in that laboratory

working on the same thing over
and over until they get it right.

They're like female
Olympic gymnasts.

Eventually they stop growing.
They're stunted.

So you think
I'm stunted.

No. You and I are the same.
We're different.

You're not like them.

Why do you say "them" when
you talk about the guys in lab?

I mean, aren't
you one of them?

No. I go to classes and I work
in a lab, but I'm not like them.

Of course, because you are
the big fish in a small pond.

After all, you are the man.

What?
What?

I just can't believe we haven't
met you guys before.

I know! We've been
downstairs the whole time!

Simon!

Come here.

Simon, this is Hazel
and this is Whitney.

Hi!
Hi.

These lovely ladies are
our downstairs neighbors.

Not for long.
Our lease is up at the end of the month

but we couldn't move out without,
like, officially meeting you guys.

Yeah, definitely.

From what we've heard, you
guys definitely seem cool.

Definitely.
Really?

Who've you
been talking to?

It's not like someone
came up to us in the hall

and was all like, those guys upstairs
are hella cool da-da-da-da-da.

Yeah, I mean we can hear like everything
that goes on in your apartment.

Everything?
Everything.

And Simon, that Jane
woman is so wrong for you.

I mean, there are so many
other women out there.

She definitely
doesn't deserve you.

Yeah, definitely.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

You said something
about a tour.

So are you gonna give it to me?
I want it too!

All right, well, I just remembered
I forgot to do something. So yeah...

Bye Simon!

Well, this is the
living room and...

...my bedroom is down the hall.
Wanna see it?

Definitely!
Definitely!

Ow! My hair is caught!
Stop moving your head!

You need to help us.
Please.

I'll be right back.

Oh. Hey.
Hey.

Oh, yeah.
Vivian isn't feeling too good.

She's been getting sick
in the mornings lately.

I think she should
take a pregnancy test.

Um, so is this a
follow-up visit?

Yeah, I guess
you can say that.

Ok, well, this isn't
a dentist's office

unless coming back here feels
like pulling teeth to you.

No, I was just wondering what
you were doing this afternoon.

Vivian is sick.
I can't leave her alone.

Well, what are you
doing tonight?

I'm performing in a Poetry Slam.
It's the semi-finals.

Oh, I didn't know
you were into that.

Yeah, I'm into it.

You could give your whole
dissertation in haiku.

A voice. In front of me.
An idiot emerges.

I'm sorry.

Do you always insult things
that you aren't familiar with?

No.

Look, if you sincerely
want to be edified

show up at 8 at the club
around the corner.

Okay. I will.
I'll show up.

Vivian, I hope
you feel better!

Lock the door
when you leave.

Yeah, I know
the routine.

So, like you know,
Lo wanted me to...

I mean, I wanted to apologize...

for how hard I came at you
the other day.

I'm sorry for how hard I
came at you the other day.

I was out of line and
I apologize as well.

So we Hindu?
No beef?

None at all.

Yeah, man.
We're cryogenic.

Yes, you are correct.
We are cryogenic.

There it is! Posse's back!
Come on, let's celebrate!

This is the Jimmy I like. When you
actually annunciate and speak correctly.

What's wrong with my words?
I'm flowing.

I got a grill coming in, too,
next week.

I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
I'm gonna be hard.

Call Covonne.
I know exactly where we can go.

Let's get some drinks, yo.

A shift of paradigms.
I drop a pair of dimes in the meter.

That's what I'm
talking about!

Oh. Oh. Oh.
Talent. Talent. Talent.

Trese!
Hey.

Told you I'd be here.
And I broughtyou your new fans.

Jimmy, Lorenzo, Covonne.
Guys. Trese.

Vivian.
Vivian.

Hi guys. Thank
you for coming.

Los muchachos on
your old block

were probably itchin' for
your quinceañera.

They probably could not
wait for you to come of age.

Excuse me.
Do you have a pen?

Is that your friend?
No.

I'm friends with those two.
I'm on stage next.

So I'll see
you guys later.

Good luck!
Adios!

You don't look like you feel well.
Shouldn't you be in bed or something?

I've seen every one of Trese's
performances this year.

That's 36 more than
you've been to, bub.

And I'm not about
to miss this one.

You're a real classy lady.
You're buying.

This was inspired by
the man at that table.

His name is Jimmy.

What? Yeah, because
I got it like that!

Having curly hair and yellow skin does not
mean that I don't know my black father.

And just because
I have to get a tan...

doesn't mean that I am
confused about my identity.

So no you are not too "black"
for me. You are just ugly.

And being darker than me doesn't give you
the right to identify my proper identity

just because you are uncomfortable
being more negro que la negra.

In the city, I am
suddenly Puertoriquena

as beautiful men with
beautiful voices ask me

Eres Boriqua? Brazilena?
Dominicana? Cubana?

So I am sorry if what
you see confuses you.

If you do not know how to
put me in the file folder

that can be easily shelved in the
census bureau of your brain.

I will not placate you.

So include me when you mention
those 7 black people you know.

Because I am not different on
account of you feeling I look so.

Me, an item of mystification, not to be
confused by your bureaucracy of thought.

I am something
higher than race

bigger than the color strands of your
hair or the tint in your skin.

I am not multicultural.
I am universal.

And that has nothing to do
with race.

So let's scramble.

So why are you
really here?

You know when you question
everything I do, it makes you...

...you're at your
least attractive.

So there are times when
you find me attractive?

Well, you did show up
with a cheering section.

There's something to be
said for accountability.

Are you saying that you
counted on me being here?

No I a-ccounted for
you being here.

Because after I recite this
little number I wrote for you

I will have reached my
quota for the night.

You wrote
me a poem?

"555-3242"

Haiku-d you call me if you
don't have my number? Get it?

Haiku.
I get it.

Well, I have to
take Viv home.

Do you need some help?
No, I'm fine.

I love you.
I love you too, honey.

Hey, so what
do you think?

About what?
About Trese.

Better not
fuck that up.

Hey Simon. This is Jane.
I guess you're not home yet.

I'll be up for awhile.
Cell me. Bye.

I promise I'll stop treating
you like an experiment.

Lately, I've been treating
guys like experiments

just to prove my hypothesis that all
men have questionable motives.

But I promise I won't treat you
like one of my guinea pigs.

Thank you.

So what are you
going to do for me?

Um, let's go
shoe shopping.

I told you that I was going to stop
making generalizations about men

and then you go and
make one about women?

What're you talking about?
Ooh.

Whoa! What are you doing?
We got a security deposit.

This is for Jimmy. I was pouring out
some liquor for my fallen partner.

What happened to Jimmy?

He pulled a 4-9-0
and got locked up.

Shut up.
Jimmy killed somebody?

You need to revisit the teachings
of the good Dr. Dre. That's a 1-8-7.

What's a 4-9-0?

Shoplifting.

Jimmy's boys were barbecuing.
He gaffled some meat.

Jimmy's an idiot.
Yeah.

Clean that up!

Jimmy? What happened to you?

Prison has been known
to change a man.

I heard you were in a
holding cell for two hours.

I did a lot of thinking
when I was serving time.

Gwen, you are the best
thing to ever happen to me

but I wanted to
run the streets.

But all I ended up doing
was running the streets.

What makes you think I want anything
to do with a washed up ex-con?

You think a dye job
and a wardrobe change

are going to make up for all
the times you wronged me?

Wait, Gwen. Please.
Just give me a chance.

Are you really gonna treat me right?
Yeah.

And I'm your girlfriend.
Not your bitch.

Maybe just around the boys, you know,
so they don't think I went soft.

Let's get one thing straight
here, Hamburglar.

You're the one standing here
begging me to take you back.

Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Now that makes me your...?

Most def.

Oh my god.
You are so funny.

If that guy weren't my boss, I'd
throw him down aflight of stairs.

Where should we go?
Yo, Gwen!

Jimmy? This is...
Stephen.

But it's spelled
with a P-H.

There are people who still
mispronounce it and call me Stefan.

So I just tell everyone
to call me Steve.

It lessens the
complication.

I'm Jimmy.
That's short for Gwen's boyfriend.

Stephen is a consultant
with the firm.

And he and I were going to catch a
Happy Hour and discuss a project.

Sounds good.
Where're we going?

Stephen just bought a
building in North Beach.

I dabble in real estate.
It generates income.

Allows me to pursue
my true calling, music.

Oh yeah? What's the
name of your band?

The San Francisco Symphony.

Excuse me.
I have to make a "vone" call.

Hello.
Anita, it's Lorenzo.

Yeah, you've got
the wrong number.

He's over there isn't he?
I think you have the wrong number.

So are you going to do some
Bible thumping tonight?

Hello.

Hey Raylene.
Listen, I'm kinda hungry.

Why don'tyou pick up some
Chinese food and come over?

I can't. My boyfriend's here.

Okay, wait for him fall asleep.
Then come over and tuck me in.

I don't know, Lorenzo.
Just call me some other time.

What are you doing?

Drive.
What?

I don't want to drive all the way home.
I just had a little too much to drink.

Get off me!
Get off me! Just drive.

I'd drive for you.

Great night.
Had a blast.

Hey Lorenzo,
you're awesome.

Shut up.
Give me a cigarette.

No!

Good morning Lorenzo.
Simon's at the lab.

Doyou want
some cereal?

You want to talk, huh?

And you probably want me to
give you some dirt on Simon.

Not at all. I just want to get to
know my boyfriend's best friend.

I don't want you to know me
as just "Simon's girlfriend".

Okay, maybe I do want
some inside information.

Did Simon ever tell
you he paid for college with...

the money he won on Teen Jeopardy?
He never mentioned it.

That's our boy, Simon.

He doesn't like to whip out the big
brain too early in a relationship.

Does Simon really think that he'll
scare me off with his intellect?

We attend the same institution.
We're equals.

Yeah, if you
think so.

I can't believe
you just said that.

Women always have the advantage
over men in relationships.

It's up to you if you want to take
it or if you want to get taken.

If Simon is so afraid of chasing women
away with the size of his cranium

then why would he display it on national
television for the female populous to see?

He didn't really want to.
It's a long story.

In high school, there was this girl,
Meredith Rolan. Regally blonde.

Her head was underneath
every plastic tiara.

And Simon was royally sprung.
He tutored her after school.

Meredith was dating Neal Culver,
a big timer on campus.

The guy had superstar status
and he didn't even play a sport.

He was in drama?

One day at lunch,
the word's out.

Simon's screwing
around with Meredith.

He's dead. Period. History.
Final period, chemistry.

Everybody knew how
Neal would react.

Explosively?
Yeah.

You know how
when you take a bottle,

put dry ice in it,
fill it water and cap it...

...carbon dioxide is formed, and the
pressure causes the bottle to...

...blow the hell up. Simon tried to
show me that once in high school.

Like chemistry could be a
blast or something like that.

It didn't really matter.
I still flunked.

You know, that's the one thing
I remember from chemistry.

Anyway, right before the final
bell, Simon's locker blows up.

The cops and bomb squad swoop in
and they evacuated everybody.

They find pieces of plastic and
dry ice from the chemistry lab.

So there was no fight that day.
No, not ever.

Simon got kicked out
of school the next day.

Simon was expelled?

The school was in the burbs.
Simon kinda kept to himself.

Maybe he wore a little too
much black. I don't know.

Anyway, he lost
his scholarship.

Oh, so that's why he had to go~
on Jeopardy. To pay for college.

Yeah, all because I put
that bottle in his locker.

I don't get it.
My contents were under pressure!

I was the one screwing around
with Meredith, not Simon.

She told Neal it was Simon
just to cover my ass.

She didn't give a shit about him.

And to this day, I
still haven't told him.

I want to. I went over to his
house the first day after school.

And I couldn't do it.

And I kept going over
there every day.

I don't know.
We just became best friends.

But you were
just a kid.

I've never felt like I've been as good a
friend to Simon as he's been to me.

So, I got a job.

Congratulations! You're a productive
member of society again.

You can go get your car fixed.
Actually, I sold the Impala.

But I loved... but
you loved that car.

I needed the money to move
out of the folks' place, you know?

Yeah, I guess
that's important.

Paying rent is so fiscally
stupid on so many levels!

You can't afford to buy a place around
here, so what are you going to do?

Well, you're
paying rent.

I don't understand why I have to
pay rent for another apartment

and put my stamp
on the system.

Wait. Are you saying you
want us to live together?

Two economic wrongs
don't make a right.

And besides, I want to
be with you, Gwen.

So what do you say?

Hi Lorenzo, is Simon here?
No.

Do you know where he is?
No.

Okay.

Are you doing anything?

So as a woman, would you ever want
to be with a guy who was aimless?

I'm sure women would
want to be with someone

that has some idea of what
he wants do with his life.

I guess there's a reason why
drifters are loners, right?

Are you talking about
anyone specific?

I don't know what I want
to do with my life.

I don't think you have to
worry about that, you're pretty.

Look, you're young.

And there are a lot of adults who
don't know where they're headed.

That's why they always ask kids, 'What
do you want to be when you grow up?"

It's because they're
looking for ideas.

All right,
it's my turn.

I can tell Simon really cares
about what you think.

So what do you
think about me?

I can see you
growing on me.

Whoopee.

Thanks for the company. It was fun.
Yeah, sure.

Simon, are you there?

Hey.
Hey.

Did you kids have a good time?
Yeah, it was great.

Hey, it's after 12!

Dinner shift doesn't
start till 6.

Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

The only thing I have to do today is
remember every detail from last night

and write it all down in my blog, so the
whole world wide web can read about it.

I don't think
there's an emoticon.

or smiley that describes
how I feel.

Oh, I forgot your name.
I can't remember anything.

I think you came
in my brain.

Simon, it's Jane. Where are you?

Lorenzo.

You know how you're
always saying the best way...

to get a girl to want you
is to be inaccessible?

That could not be more true.
Yeah, Lo knows hoes.

I mean, Jane never called
before I started seeing Trese.

Did you say Jane?

I think she really
misses me.

Yeah, Simon, you win.
All right, let it go.

Oh wait!

Are you going
to call her?

Yeah.
It's my turn to do the mistreating.

This is Jane we're talking about here.
She loves messing with guys' heads.

I got this.

Simon!

Look, just be
careful, all right?

Jane, it's Simon.
Hey!

Now what are you
working on again?

I know you've explained it to me
like 10 times already,

but you know I'm a boob top.

Explain it to me one more time. Please.
Okay.

I'll usevisuals
this time.

Okay, I've constructed a protein
that can bind itself to cancer cells.

Let's say this is the tumor,
and this is the protein.

This protein has another part
to it that attacks the cancer.

But it only works if the protein
is attached to the tumor.

That way all the normal cells
around it are unaffected.

It's a viable alternative to radiation and
chemotherapy. It's extremely exciting!

Or not. I lost you again.
Didn't I?

Oh no, you didn't lose me.
Okay look, here's the tumor...

Oh! Okay. All right.
No, that's okay.

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

Hey, I left a key under the mat.
Meet me in 30 minutes, okay?

Shit.

Good night.

I can't letyou do this
to Simon anymore.

You can't let me do this?
I'm not doing this by myself.

What's so funny?
I've just never seen you so moralistic.

When did that happen?

I'm sure all the girls
that you've done and ditched...

would probably wanna know
the same thing.

Let him go.

If you want me to
break Simon's heart

I can just tell him that his best friend
is fucking the woman he loves.

I'm sure that
would do it.

Gwen said you just got out of jail.
Did you get any tats?

I was only incarcerated
for a little while.

Well, what were you in for?
Um, I stole some meat.

Oh.

Let's watch
the movie.

Oh, so you never told
me how that date went.

Oh yeah.
Well, it's going good.

So it's serious?

I guess.
I don't know.

Wow.
Yeah.

I envy you, Simon.

I mean, seeing someone
somewhat seriously is special.

Yeah.

I've never really told you
how much I appreciate you.

I mean, I know I'm
high-maintenance.

But you should know all those times
that you went out of your way for me...

...they haven't
gone unnoticed.

It was no big deal.

Thank you, Simon.

Jimmy!

In the kitchen!

Jimmy, did you clean?
You're cooking?

Yup.
Is that nuoc mam?

It's amazing whatyou can do
with fish sauce. Come on. Here.

Is something wrong?

I'm really not sure
how to say this.

It's okay, honey.
Just spit it out.

Okay, Jimmy.
You're a pussy.

What? I thought this
is whatyou wanted.

You're losing your sense of manliness,
and it's turning me off.

What the hell did you just do that for?
Because you don't need it!

I mean, the way you were sucking
up to Stephen's trashtalking

you might as well slap a bag on your
ass and crawl around on the floor

because you were all lips
and lungs back at the bar.

Jimmy please! The only reason I did
that was to get your ass in gear

and to get you to do something!
I did do something!

But I mean...

I can change.

I can buy you a new vacuum cleaner.
Whatever you want.

It's too late, Jimmy.

I don't even get off when
I'm on top anymore.

He'll be here.

Hey babe. It's Jane.

Listen, there's something
I need to tell you...

and I don't want to
do it over the phone.

Can you please come
over for dinner tonight?

I wrote this with
someone in mind.

That person is
not here tonight.

"I fear that you may
forget sometimes,

'cause I let you see me cry
how tough I am".

"The strength I hold.
The power deep inside".

"If in your presence these eyes tear
If you feel emotion here"

"Consider yourself blessed".

"It means you're liked and trusted.
It means you're better than the rest".

The other night when you told
meyou were seeing someone

you looked so happy.

And I did something I told
myself I would never do.

But it was so unexpected.

I just couldn't understand
why I didn't do it sooner.

That's why I wanted
to tell you that I...

Don't move.

Yeah, come on up.

The food's here.

"Even when I'm gentle, falling like a
leaf into your out-stretched arms".

"On to your shoulders weep.
You will remember".

Hey! Perfect timing.

Simon, this is Max.

Hey, it's nice to
meetyou, Simon.

I decided to call Max.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

"You must remember to call me by my
true name. I am a strong woman".

"Artemis. Shakti. Tower of fists.
Stone gaze. Medusa".

"Kali is my right hand".

"I am a bad ass bitch".

You were great.

Can I get a glass of
white wine, please?

Lorenzo?
Hey.

And so out of the blue, Jane calls
me and says she wants me back.

I mean, yeah,
I was seeing some other chick,

but when Jane called,
it was a no-brainer.

I mean, look at her.

I understand your
thought process.

So Simon, how doyou know Jane?

We're friends.

And Simon is so smart.

He's a scientist.

Oh, do that thing
with the tumor.

Where's Simon?
He's not here?

He didn't show up.

He's probably stuck somewhere.
I'm sure he feels awful.

What's the matter, Simon?

Isyour stomach churning?

Doyou have this empty feeling
in the pit ofyour stomach?

Maybe the pain is just a little higher up.

Is your heart burning?
Babe, I think you mean heartburn.

Yeah, that's
what I meant.

What's his problem?

He didn't stand a chance.
Now it's just us.

Don't fucking touch me!

I bet Simon feels awful.
But how do you feel?

What do you mean?

You know what
I mean, Lorenzo.

But I know
how you feel.

Trust me, I know
how you feel.

I knew that poetry
wasn't your thing, and I guess...

maybe being with me
wasn't your thing either.

But come back to the lab.
That is your thing.

Don't let me get in the way of that.
Good bye, Simon.

You're fucking up,
aren'tyou?

Not now, Lorenzo.

It's Jane, isn't it?
I told you forget her.

That made me want her more.

You don't think I knew what every guy
was thinking when I was out with her.

'What the fuck is she
doing with him?"

In a sense, you were saying
the same thing.

You were so sure that Jane
was going to hurt me

because you didn't think
I was good enough for her.

That's why I wanted to prove
to myself, and to you

and to every other
motherfucker out there

that the good guy
could get the girl.

Because I deserved to.

Being the good guy never
entitled you to shit.

Plus, you got the girl.
You got Trese.

I loved Jane!

Oh, so you endured
all this shit for love.

Yes.

God, you weren't even in
love, you masochistic fuck.

You loved the pain.

It made you feel good to think
you were the good guy.

But how good a guy have you been?
Really?

Stringing Trese along so
you can get in Jane's head.

Like I said,
you fucked up.

You want to know what's fucked up?
Hearing you talk about love.

You've got your dick in every
fucking hole in this city.

How do you know
anything about love?

But I guess all your escapades
did allow you some insight.

You called it right with Jane.
Didn't you?

Yeah, well, I probably didn't need
to sleep with Jane...

to get a read on her, did I?

How long?

Past four months.

Past four months.

Well, I guess that's why you
wanted me to get over Jane.

That way you could
fuck her guilt free.

You never grew up, Lorenzo.

You're the same fucking guy
you were in high school.

Oh and guess what?
I knew about Meredith Rolan.

But see, up until
this moment

I thought I could use
any friend I could get.

I'm sorry.
Fuck you.

Fuck you.

Trese, he's back. I knew he'd be back.
Men are so predictable.

Lorenzo?
It's for you.

What is this?

Can we talk?

Yeah.

Vivian, keys.

I didn't know
you smoked.

Read it.

Out loud.

"You just know.
The first time you sit in a kitchen...

across from her
and her eyes twinkle"

"and her voice and thoughts force their
way through your heart. You just know".

"That one hour with her is
like a day with anyone else".

"You just know that she could have given
you everything if only you had let her".

"You just know that meeting her
allowed you not to settle for less"

"and that if you keep o
being yourself...

there will be someone
who will eclipse her".

"Or at least that's what you
keep telling yourself".

Lorenzo gave it to me.

I didn't think a guy
with heart existed.

But the man that
wrote this has heart.

That's all I ever wanted.

You came all the way here to tell me you
want to be with the guy that wrote this?

Yes.

Yup.
I'm lonely.

It's a bitch, ain't it?

We're lost,
aren't we?

Listen, I really think we should've asked
that guy back there for directions.

Crackheads have no
sense of direction.

Plus we're not lost.

How do you know he's
addicted to crack cocaine?

Okay, forget that. How do you
know where we're going?

Follow the beat.

Look in my eyes. Eye contact.
