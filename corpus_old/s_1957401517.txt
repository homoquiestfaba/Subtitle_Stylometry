<i>* I can see wrong and right

Aaron.

Aaron!

Where have you been, man?

Can you stay by yourself for a moment?

Be right back.
Yeah.

Aaron! Aaron!

Not again, man.
Look what you did to the wall.

I did all that?

Look at your hands.

Forget about it. Time to go now.

What about my gloves?

What was that?

What am I gonna fight with?

Aaron.

Just take your guitar and follow me, okay?

My guitar.

Okay.
Let's go.

The good thing about being crazy
is the fact that you don't realise it.

Well, that's not my case.

It all started when I first became champ.

I'd prepared for this
ever since I was a little kid.

The thing was,
that I was getting into the ring

thinking that the guy in front of me
stood between me and my dream.

<i>After each fight,</i>

<i>I felt sorry for what I had done...</i>

<i>but only for a while.</i>

<i>I became
the middleweight champion...</i>

<i>and it all changed.</i>

<i>And, of course, there was Evelyn.</i>

<i>My brain was definitely starting
to be affected because...</i>

Whoo!

The carpet there, please.

Yes, there.

Uh, take the <i>Scarface</i> off.

And the belt.

We gotta change everything!

<i>To be honest, I wasn't preparing
for the fights like I used to.</i>

Come on, Aaron.

<i>If we accept that
my marriage was the first sign</i>

<i>that there was something wrong with me,
this was the second.</i>

<i>Very concerned for my health,</i>

<i>Michael and Evelyn wanted me to do just
one more fight before I took a break.</i>

<i>I hope you've caught
the irony in my words.</i>

What's that mean?
You cannot fight anymore.

What?
What?

You should start treatment.

How much is that gonna cost?
Shut up, Evelyn.

I cannot talk about that?
Shut your mouth, Evelyn.

He cannot fight anymore and
the lawsuits are coming, do you get it?

I get it. I got it!
Do you get it?

You're not!

I can't fight anymore?

<i>Yeah. The lawsuits came.</i>

<i>I lost.</i>

<i>I started getting lost almost every day.</i>

<i>Missing for hours.</i>

<i>Maybe days.</i>

Look at me, Aaron.

Aaron, look at me!

Look at me!

I'm doing everything I can for you,
God is my witness.

I gave you all my support,
but you have to give something back!

Are you listening to me?

You don't care!

You don't care about anything!

About nothing...

<i>Of course, Evelyn's reaction
was not surprising.</i>

Aren't you gonna even try to stop me?

<i>My mind was blocked.</i>

<i>And that's how I ended up here.</i>

<i>Trying to make a living
through one of my old hobbies.</i>

Bo... Bobby?

You're late for work.

Shit.

You said you were gonna submit him
in the first round.

I tried.

You don't shut up,
he'll be disqualified.

Hey, don't look at her in the eyes,
alright?

Hurry up.

I'll be right there.

I can't.
You said you'd try.

I changed my mind.

The doctor recommended this, remember?

Sorry, guys. Sorry.

He didn't recommend this place.

Shit. They've started without me.

Whoo!

Uh, maybe some
of you know this song.

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I can't survive *</i>

<i>* Can't stay alive *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I can't exist without your tender kiss *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* Baby *</i>

<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

<i>* So come on down
And do what you gotta do *</i>

<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

<i>* Now, can't you see?
It's burning out of control *</i>

<i>* Come on down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I can't survive *</i>

<i>* I can't stay alive *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I can't exist without your tender kiss *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* Baby *</i>

<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

<i>* So come on down
And do what you gotta do *</i>

<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

<i>* Only you can love me *</i>

<i>* And be out of control *</i>

<i>* Satisfy the need in me *</i>

<i>* Only your good loving can set me free *</i>

<i>* Only your good loving can set me free *</i>

<i>* Only your good loving *</i>

<i>* Can set me free *</i>

Where are you going?

One song? You can't do this again.

I gave it all I got.

If I go on, then it won't be real.

Who gives a shit?
People are here to see you.

Michael, please.
Aaron.

We can't afford it, okay?

It's clear for everyone now
that Aaron is kind of crazy.

So, I'm taking over the story from now on.

Don't worry, you're in better hands.
And here comes the question.

Who am I and what am I doing here? Right?

Well, it all started with her.

<i>We were born
and raised in Bulgaria.</i>

<i>Ever since I was little,
people were finding me too weird.</i>

<i>The thing was that,
up until my eighth year,</i>

<i>I simply refused
to communicate with anybody.</i>

<i>So, what?</i>

<i>So, what?</i>

<i>Because of her,
my parents made me learn sign language.</i>

<i>Come on. It's not that easy.</i>

<i>I spent almost a year studying.</i>

<i>I could at least have had
a few deaf friends.</i>

<i>My parents decided I was retarded.</i>

<i>They sent me to a school
for mentally challenged children.</i>

<i>There were only gypsies there,
who weren't retarded.</i>

<i>They were there
because of the free textbooks and food.</i>

<i>I don't know what made me leave
my usual apathetic state.</i>

<i>Spitting competition?</i>

<i>I don't know, but that was the start
of a very unusual friendship.</i>

<i>Actually,
it was the start of a new family.</i>

<i>They taught me everything they knew,
and I quickly became one of the them.</i>

<i>You know that sexual maturation
usually does not come with a mental one.</i>

<i>With Jana, it was even more...</i>

<i>Actually, you better see it for yourself.</i>

Here comes the crazy Jana.

Beware not to let her catch you.

Bobby?

Shut up, you morons.

<i>That was it.</i>

<i>The only people Jana wanted to have
something to do with were the gypsies...</i>

<i>and me.</i>

What's up, babe?

Hey, Mr. Hunter.

Hi.
Did you see that girl who...

who was walking around all the people?
I didn't see her.

Uh, well... well, that's my sister. Yeah.

It's your sister?
Yeah, and her name is, uh, Jana.

Jana, come back!
I won't do it.

We need the money.

And you have to talk to other people.
Don't make me, Bobby!

There is a guy who...
Please, don't make me go back.

His bed is
right next to the door.

Okay.

Jana, don't you think it's time
you found someone?

I don't know.

I have you, don't I?

You know what I mean.

You want to get rid of me!

No, I don't.
It's a normal thing for every woman.

Now you think I'm normal.

What about Aaron? The singer.

But... he's crazy.

At least he likes you.

You don't know.

I'm not making this up.
I spoke to him.

You can go on a date, hang out.
We'll see how it turns out.

Look, this might be good for both of us.

He used to be a fighter.

Jana?

Hey, Bobby.

Bobby, I know you're in there.

I saw you come back
with that crazy wacko sister of yours.

Hey, calm down, John.
I'll give you the money, okay?

When?
Soon, man. Soon.

It's just, my sister's medication
is very expensive, okay?

I understand, Bobby.
But don't bullshit me.

'Cause I'll send you back to Bolivia
or wherever the hell you came from!

It's not Bolivia. It's Bulgaria.
Whatever!

Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

Ain't gonna give his money back.
Of course not.

But in order to fully understand
what I'm about to do now,

I should tell you more about me.

Now is the time for the camera
to zoom towards my face.

Yeah, that's better.

When I was 20,
I became a national kickboxing champion.

Yeah.

And also won a few MMA tournaments.

Whoo!

Since I was a child,
I was hooked on American movies,

but I wasn't prepared
for the Bulgarian reality yet.

Mmm.

Come on.

<i>I always dreamed of living in Manhattan.</i>

<i>I was surprised how cheap the rent was.</i>

<i>The path to my dream
was going to be a long one.</i>

<i>So, I had to find a job.</i>

<i>I decided to ask
for help from my coach, Teddy.</i>

<i>And he asked me,
"What could you do except fighting?"</i>

<i>Finally, my sister was useful.</i>

<i>I came up with the brilliant idea
of starting a company called.</i>

<i>Music for the Deaf.</i>

Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

Well, that's not alright.

We should rewind a bit.

It's just my sister's medication
is very expensive.

I understand, Bobby.
But don't bullshit me.

'Cause I'll send you back to Bolivia,
or wherever the hell you came from!

It's Bulgaria. Not Bolivia.
Whatever!

Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

Bobby!

Bobby, it's been a few months
since I've seen money.

I swear I'll come back with immigration.

What are you doing?
I want you to listen.

You can go back
on your banana boat, back to Bolivia!

You and your sister can say goodbye
to your dreams of getting green cards.

Bobby!

I'm coming back with immigration!
I swear to God!

You look really nice!

It's okay. Um...

We're safe now.

Calm down. Everything's fine.

I... I don't feel good.

I spent all day preparing,
and maybe I overdid it with...

my make-up.

Yeah, it's too much, but you look fine.

Look...

You have problems.

Everyone can see that,
but I can read your vibrations,

and they are telling me
you're not a bad person.

Don't you think we're like two parents

who have left their children
at preschool for the first time?

I can't believe you're using
your sister like that.

I'm sure you guys are making tons
of cash from his concerts.

Aaron can't make a comeback.
He's banned for life.

Not in Bulgaria.

He hasn't.

But anyway,
I don't feel a connection between us.

So, let's not waste our time, please.

What?

I'm sorry, um...

You know I have, uh...

Oh, don't take it personally.

I just don't like people in general.

No, it's, it's hard for me to follow
when someone is talking for a long time.

I got the first part.

But, judging from your expression,
the rest wasn't so positive.

Wow, it's not possible
to have a conversation with you.

I...

I better go now.

<i>How'd the date go?</i>

Aaron, I asked you a question.

I have to remind you
that if you don't want to speak with me,

you will become
a permanent resident of my clinic,

and you will be given sedatives

that will keep you very calm
and cooperative at all times.

She's just a lot crazier than me.
That's all.

You know that I get along
better with wackos, but this was too much.

Excuse me.
Are you talking to me?

No, I'm talking to my brother.

Forty dollars, please.

Now, I'm talking to you.

<i>Crazier than you.</i>

Could you explain?

I took her to a nice place.

He took me
to a crowded diner.

It's the first place
that came into my mind.

I always choose the first because...

I'm afraid if...

if I choose the second,

then I'll forget
what I'm thinking about in general.

I decided to be
completely honest with him but he just...

This woman...

talks so much.

And she expects me
to listen to everything she has to say.

What happened after the date?

Hey!

Come back.

What are you doing in there?

So the guys from the restaurant
don't catch me.

Oh, I... I gave them some money.
I already paid for everything.

I-I'm not gonna pay you back.

Well, okay.

Bye.

Wait.

After the date, she wanted me to,
um... walk her home

'cause she can't walk on the street
because of all the people.

Yeah, she sure chose
the right person to ask, right?

He didn't even want
to get a cab for me.

If you call it,
I'll pay for it.

Are you crazy?

You probably want me
to talk to him as well.

No, no. I can talk to him.

I-I just can't... I just can't stop it.

I stopped it!
Can you imagine?

No.

Hold up?
Yeah.

Hey, were you waving at me?

Yeah! Uh, could you take us to...

Canal and West Broadway.

Canal and West Broadway?

Are you guys insane?

We're perfectly normal.

The world is insane.

He said he wasn't
completely alright in the head, but...

I tell you,
after that date that I had with her,

I haven't felt that sane in years.

This is where
the craziest part happened.

And then
she keeps whining about...

...how dangerous it is.

Do you come home like this every night?

Me and my brother owe the neighbour money.

<i>And you just left him there?</i>

That's crazy... Uh, I'm sorry.

No, I understand you entirely.

But I just realised something else.

This is the first time
you've managed to tell

the entire story in the right order.

I want you to think about that.

You know it won't last long.

Yes, I know.

That is why...

Please forget everything I said
at the start of the conversation.

With any luck, you probably already have.

Take these twice a day. They'll help.

Michael!

I saw you, Michael.
I told you already.

You want too much.

I want a normal alimony
without taking it to court.

The tour is off. He ran off stage again.

Why do you expect him to do normal things?

You should know better.
You'll just leave him on the street!

What does he need you for?
Aaron is out of control.

It's like dealing with a child.
I'm a woman.

Do you expect me to feel sorry
about my ex...

Exactly, you are a woman.
You're supposed to be sorry for him.

I want my alimony. Then I will be sorry.

Well, that's not happening now!

Well, you're not leaving me any choice.

Well, fuck you, Evelyn!
Fuck you, Michael!

Okay. Well, there is one weird option.

No way! Never again!
We both need it.

I don't feel it.
I don't care.

Why are you still driving?
You don't have a license!

I might have to take you back to Bulgaria.

And you'll stay here?
But you like it there.

And you won't say anything?

Come with me.

What are you doing?

I didn't pay for these, did I?
No.

Oh, God.

We gotta take these back.

Hey!
It's too late. Come!

<i>* And by the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wet and more *</i>

<i>* Shivering and shaking
Like some freaky baby *</i>

Hey, where's your car?

Oh, cool.

Hey, there. Unlock the door.

Unlock...

And?

I have to borrow your bike.

What?
I'll... I'll bring it right back.

Uh, dude?

I think Aaron Hunter just stole my bike.

You left me.
I know.

Why?

Nobody else gets into the car,
only my brother.

Well, I had to steal a bike
because of you.

It will help you get home.

<i>* And by the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wet and more *</i>

<i>* Shivering and shaking *</i>

<i>* Like some freaky baby girl
On the dance floor *</i>

<i>* So drip it from your lips
I got your jazz all wet *</i>

<i>* Your keys are screamin' in high C *</i>

<i>* Your chord, your dripping sweat *</i>

<i>* Now I'm turnin' my dolls up
To my frequency *</i>

<i>* Baby, the coalition of your atoms
Is freaking me *</i>

<i>* I see you spillin' whole notes
Out your mouth with no rest *</i>

<i>* You spillin' majors and minors
And sharps and clefts *</i>

<i>* And you rockin'd</i>

<i>* And you rockin' and rollin'd</i>

<i>* Soul drippin' off the ceiling *</i>

<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

Aaron.

Aaron.

I, um...

I didn't remember...
I didn't know how I got here.

I, uh...

It's all right.
I think I remember now.

I will take you back.

Okay, okay.

Okay?
Okay.

Hey, Doc.
Are you noticing what I think you should...

<i>Aaron, I'm with a patient.</i>

She must be boring you to death
because you answered the phone.

<i>Let me guess.
You haven't been taking your meds.</i>

No, and I'm lookin' you
in your eyes, you see?

<i>Alcohol works as well.</i>

Now, you know I don't drink.
<i>- It must be a woman, then.</i>

<i>Knowing how antisocial you are,
it should be the one from the last time.</i>

<i>So, she's not crazy anymore?</i>

No, she's still crazy. But in a good way.

<i>There's a good way?</i>

Listen, I don't know if it's
because of her. I just wanted you to see...

...I'm doing well, lookin' you in the eyes.

Aaron!
And my memory's stable.

Aaron Hunter?
Yeah.

You are under arrest...

Let go of me. I haven't done anything.
Sir, let him go.

I was just walking down the street.
Let him go right now.

Look, you're makin' a mistake.
Let go of him right now.

But I haven't done anything!

You have stolen a bike!

No, I didn't.
Yes, you did!

Oh, yes. I did. Alright. Yeah.

I'll start taking my pills.

<i>* I can see wrong and right
But I never choose a side *</i>

<i>* Runnin' on red, not black or white *</i>

<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

Nice day.
Yeah, hot.

Thanks.

I've parked further down.

It's 25 bucks per hour.

Yo, Bobby!
Hi, Tony. I'm in a hurry, man.

I got that job you asked for.

You can serve here.

So, do I look like a waiter?
No, but the other day, you...

Do I look like a waiter to you?

Hold on, Bobby.
You're the one who was asking for a job.

I'm offering you a job.
Go inside or I'll kick your ass.

What the hell's wrong with you?
You want me to serve tables?

I was a champion, alright? Fuck off!

No, fuck you.
Fuck off!

Fuck you, Bobby.
I'm sorry, man.

You guys are lovers or something?
No.

You a champion of what?
Yeah, I was a champion like you.

Oh, yeah. Michael said that.

Yeah, I was a state champion.

I shook the hand of the prime minister.

You know what they call that in Bulgaria?

What?
They call it success.

Big success.

How did you get me out?

I bailed you out.

Where did you get all that money?

I got money.

Is this is your car?

Uh, no.

But you got money?

Yeah, I got money.

Okay.

So, whose car is this?

Alright, Jana sold the car.
Are you happy now?

Sold your car?
Yeah.

No, I'm not happy.

You could've asked Michael for the money.

You got in jail
'cause of me and my sister.

Michael has nothing to do with it, okay?

What? Now, how does Jana get around, then?

She walks, she uses the subway,
she meets people, that's good for her.

Oh, man.
Let's go.

Come on.
That's so not cool.

So not cool.

Come on.
I'm sorry, man.

I didn't mean to cause all this trouble.

Do you remember this song?

Uh, yeah, you sang it in the club.

Yeah, I sang it in the club.
Okay.

"Don't Leave Me This Way",
Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes.

So?
That's a sign.

Sign for what?

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

Sing this song with me, man.
You're busted completely.

Come on.

You sing this song with me,
and I will do this fight against you.

You don't joke about it.
I'm not joking.

If you sing this song with me,
then I will make my comeback against you.

Can I make you do that?
Yes, you can make me do this.

Listen, you just lost your job
as a waiter,

and it's because of me
that you sold your sister's car.

So, it's the least I can do for you guys.
Sing this song for me.

<i>* Aah *</i>

<i>* Baby *</i>

<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

<i>* Now come on down, now *</i>

<i>- d What you gotta do? d</i>
Yeah.

<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

<i>* Can't you see it's burning
Out of control</i> *

<i>* So come down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

<i>* Free, free *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* 'Cause it would be wrong *</i>

We're thrilled to inform you that
the event is gonna take place

here on the 27th,

which will be Aaron "Lionheart" Hunter's
official return on the ring

against the young fighter Boris Goo...

Borislav.
Borislav "Good Night" Tyumbev.

Tumbev.
Whatever, man.

Yes?

Mr. Tumbev, or should I say Mr. Good Night,

please accept my apologies,
but you're not a well-known name

in the MMA world.

How did you get to such a big fight
against Aaron Hunter?

You may joke around with my nickname,

but when the fight is done,
you'll lose the irony, so...

Mr. Tumbev,
you're not very humble, are you?

It's hard to be humble
when you are the best!

Mr. Hunter?

Because of your mental condition,
you've been banned from fighting.

Only in the States.
And even so.

Mr. Hunter, do you think it's a good idea
to return to the ring for this fight?

Mr. Hunter?
Mr. Hunter?

Sorry. Which fight?

Come on, come on.

We arrived in Bulgaria thinking...

...or at least I thought,
we were gonna receive a warmer welcome.

Famous sponsors were not crazy
about us, either.

So that made us cut the budget
for lodging, training,

and go to the only place
I didn't want to return to.

Or at least not in this way.

Hi, Mum.

Oh, Bobby.
Hi, Mum.

Jana?

Where's dad?
Jana...

Leave your brother alone!

That's your brother, Bobby. Remember?
You should not hit him.

Hey! Hey, hey!
Daddy!

Well, this is my father.
Uh, this is Michael.

Hey, I'm Michael.
Hi.

Pleasure meeting you.
This is Aaron.

Ah, you're American?
Aaron?

Hey.
Nice to meet you.

And this is Teddy.

Uh...

Bobby, could you tell your father
he's really bad at raising children?

Dad, Mum said that...

Tell your mother that
since I've had the first pair of twins,

I can handle the second one, too.

Tell him he had very little to do with the
handling of the first ones, you know that.

Mum said...

Tell your mother this isn't
the way to greet guests.

Okay, that's enough. Come on in!
Welcome, guys.

Uh, Bobby,
do you remember Silvia?

Of course.

We sat next to each other at school.

Your laundry is above my roses, again!

I'm just watering them.
What are you complaining about?

You'll see when I cut it off!

Please, come inside.
Let's go, guys.

Are you sure
we can practice here?

This is where I started my career.

What career?

What is that?

Alright, guys. I spoke to the guard.

It's okay.
It's just a traditional dance class.

So, we can use the other side of the gym.

It's okay? What about all this noise?

Whoo!

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!

You just scared me.

At first I thought...
You might think I was crazy...

but then I remembered.

This is beautiful, here.

Whoo!

<i>* Put a little bit of soul into everyday *</i>

<i>* Add a little bit of joy
It will never fade *</i>

<i>* Let's have a good time *</i>

<i>* A good, good time *</i>

<i>* Put a little bit of soul into everyday *</i>

<i>* Add a little bit of joy
It will never fade *</i>

<i>* Let's have a good time *</i>

<i>* We're making good, good times *</i>

<i>* Oh, yeah *</i>

<i>* Oh, yeah, yeah *</i>

Thank you all so very much!

Now, ladies and gentlemen,

I see we have
a special guest here tonight,

someone we all admire,

and we'd love it if he would come up
on stage and sing us a song!

Please give him a big hand of applause,
Mr. Aaron Hunter!

They want you to play something. Come on.

Now?

You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

It's a good opportunity.

I was just writing this song
when I was chasing you

with the bike that I stole.

You're on a mic, Aaron.

Uh...

Hi, I'm Aaron.

And, um,
I recently just started doing music,

so I apologise
for what I'm about to do to you.

Oh, yeah, and I make my comeback
in the ring on the 27th

with your fellow countryman, Bobby Tumbev.

Yeah, Tumbev.

Tumbev. Tumbev.

Um, I know I should've told you at the end
of the song for a better effect,

but I doubt I would have remembered
because you know I had this...

Um, but at least I took my meds today,

so I may manage to get through
the whole song.

Okay, I'm ready.

<i>* I can see wrong and right
But I never choose a side *</i>

<i>* Runnin' on red, not black or white *</i>

<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

<i>* When they all need me *</i>

<i>* I want to do it *</i>

<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

<i>* Instead, I listen *</i>

<i>* But now I'm different *</i>

<i>* Got room to grow *</i>

<i>* Gonna kick the pieces of my shell now *</i>

<i>* Start a brand new story *</i>

<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

<i>* This is what I'm all about *</i>

<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

<i>* The better part of me *</i>

<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

<i>* You'll see the simple things *</i>

<i>* You'll see the simple things *</i>

<i>* See the simple things *</i>

<i>* Oh, yeah, yeah *</i>

<i>* By the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wanting more *</i>

<i>* Shivering and shaking
Up on the dance floor *</i>

<i>* So drip it from your lips
I got your jazz all wet *</i>

<i>* Your keys are screamin' in high C *</i>

<i>* Your chord, you're dripping sweat *</i>

<i>* Now I'm runnin' up to your frequency *</i>

<i>* The coalition of your atoms
Is freaking me *</i>

<i>* And you spillin' whole notes
Out your mouth with no rest *</i>

<i>* You spillin' majors and minors
And sharps and clefts *</i>

<i>* Soul drippin' off the ceiling *</i>

<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

Do you really want to find her?

Jana?

The Americano came
to steal Jana to marry her.

Where are you going, Rambo?

Rasho...

do you really think
Jana doesn't want to be stolen?

We can hear best from the kitchen.

What are you doing here?

I thought you had been kidnapped.

Kidnapped? By who?

By them? They are my friends.

Even the family... Why do you come?

Uh, a minute ago, I, I knew but...

the climb up here made me forget.

Uh, oh, yeah! I remember.

What?
They're talking English.

I don't unders...
Ah...

Wait. I got an app for that.

Where?
Come on.

Give me the phone! Give me the phone!

Come on. Give him the phone.
Eh!

You will suffocate
with these earplugs.

Check. Check.

You don't have to humiliate
yourself for people to like you.

It's called self-irony.

You know, you make fun of your problem
and then it becomes smaller.

But you don't have a problem.

Excuse me, but the fact that
you are saying that, means I do.

I'm begging you, don't become like them.

It's from those pills they're giving you.

Don't you get it?

Maybe you're right.

But I've noticed something with you, too.

When we had our first dates...

...you were going out with me

'cause you were getting
material gains later.

Is that true?

Yes, it is.

...but that was just
the beginning.

Then I started fighting with myself.

Something was happening inside me.

A woman's feelings, new to me.
I wanted to stop them.

Who said that?

Rasho, stop eating.

Translate.

Quiet.

So then
I started getting scared.

Scared of what?

Scared of my feelings for you.

Who is saying that?

I don't understand.

Rasho, what's going on?

It's over.

They are not talking anymore.

What's wrong?
Um...

Nothing.

Could you wait for me downstairs, please?

Downstairs? Alone? With those people?

Please, Aaron, I...

It's time for my ritual.

I can't miss it.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

Okay?
Yeah.

Wait. Hurry! He's coming.

He's coming.

Hurry up!

Get aside!

Any ideas?

Only the one I was worried about.

Maybe we should...
I'm going.

I'll open his back pocket
and you get whatever is in it.

Hey!

Hey!
Get away from him.

Aaron?
Aaron, are you alright?

Oh.

What's up, man?

Hey, what's up, man?

My sister dragged you into this,
didn't she?

Oh, man.

Hey, Doc.

Aaron! Jesus!

No, no, no. It's not what it looks like.

I, uh... I, um... I'm completely sane.

I don't know what happened.
I think I lost consciousness.

Maybe someone tried
to rob me or something.

<i>- It's okay.</i>
Let me refresh your memory.

I received all of these saying,
"What's up, Doc?"

Shit!

Exactly.

<i>Who takes a selfie with a tiger rug?</i>

<i>And to answer your question,
"How did I lose consciousness?"</i>

Aaron, you know we have to report
to your parole officer every month.

What do I say to him now?

There she is.

Uh, Doc, I gotta go.

No, no, Aaron, don't hang up, okay?

This shit is serious. More than you think.

Rasho, is there
something you're not telling me?

I gave him something to drink.

From your poison?

My whiskey is better than Johnny.

We've poisoned him!

You ditched him with the gypsies?
Are you insane?

Bobby.
He's a fighter, what could have...

They got him drunk
with bootlegged whiskey.

I can't believe he's still alive.

Aaron, I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have...
It's okay!

Actually, I was, I was having fun
until I passed out in the mud.

Aaron, please, I wanna talk to my sister.

You don't realise how...

You don't realise
how important is this fight for us.

I want you to call it off.

What?

For you it might be good,
but it's not for Aaron.

So you care more about him now?

He's doing it for us!
I've never met anyone like him.

Go to a mental institution, there's sure
to be a lot of people like him.

Don't you dare say that!

I won't allow you to call him crazy.
He's not. I'm not.

Jana...
Bobby!

Now is not the right time.

Bobby!
Michael, please shut up.

Bobby.

I sold the TV rights for the fight,
pay-per-view, motherfucker!

Wait. Wait.
Yes.

Hey!

The news with the bike
was all over the net.

Then the Bulgarian MMA federation
wanted Aaron to go to psychiatric test

just to determine
whether he's sane or not.

They could've just asked me.

Anyway, there's no such test,

they just wanted to make sure
I was gonna play by their rules.

Aaron, please.

Act like you're not crazy. Okay?

Mr. Hunter,

my apologies, I heard you have
had issues with your memory.

I have a few questions
regarding the MMA rules

and your motivation
to take part in this fight.

Mr. Hunter, my apologies,
but I heard there's some memory issues.

And I wanna ask about MMA fight rules.

What are the forbidden
actions and hits during a fight?

Alright, the forbidden hits and punches?

The fighter isn't allowed
to pull the opponent's hair,

no pokes in the eyes.

No hits below the belt,
no kicking when the opponent is down.

No punching in the back of the head,
no short rabbit punches.

How many rounds are there
in the fight and how long do they last?

How many rounds
and how many minutes?

Three rounds, five minutes each.

In which cases
does the fight finish?

What are the cases?

When the fighter taps out,

or when the referee decides
he has to stop the fight.

Why did you decide to make
your comeback here in Bulgaria?

Why did you decide
to make your comeback here in Bulgaria?

I was, uh...

I was in the car with... with Bobby.

And, uh... a song came on the radio.

And, uh...

Uh, Harold Melvin.

I told Bobby that if he would sing
the song with me,

then I will do the fight.

Um...

Oh, sorry, that's all I remember.

Uh, I noticed that
the sport is progressing quickly here.

And that Bobby has great potential.

I told Harold Melvin,
my former coach and ex-MMA fighter,

that he would be the best opponent.

Exactly.
Yes.

I've never heard of
a fighter named Harold Melvin.

I hadn't either,
but I didn't want to insult him.

* <i>So come down and satisfy
The need in me</i> *

* <i>'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free</i> *

Why the hell did you have to be so honest?

You wanted me to lie?

Yes, that's what normal people do.

I'm not normal.

Shit.

Now we're screwed.

<i>* I can see wrong and right
Never choose a side *</i>

<i>* Runnin' on red, not black and white *</i>

<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

<i>* When they all need me *</i>

<i>* I wanna do it *</i>

<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

Aaron!
He's busy.

I'll talk to you, too. Aaron!
What you've come for won't happen.

You really think I came all this way
to this shithole for you to tell me.

You're from fucking Albania!

If we reach an agreement,

I'll sign the papers
and forget about the lawsuit.

Why? You're still his wife.
You'll take half of his earnings, anyway.

Don't waste my time.
What do you want?

I know you'll twist things around,

so everything ends up in your account.
What do you want? What do you want?

I know everything is possible
in this country.

I want an equal partner's share.

Equal? Partner share?

No way, that's not happening.

No way?
Yes. No way.

I can go lower.
How lower?

I can go lower if you tell me
you made him sign the insurance.

I cannot promise you
he's gonna sign the insurance.

And regarding the cut,
you need to talk to my other partner.

Aaron's opponent is your business partner?

Yes.

Aaron.
Oh, God!

She's got what he has.
Not the same thing, Michael,

but it looks like that.
It's not the same. Similar.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just...

Hi, Aaron.
Evelyn?

I was wondering why here
or why this place, but, uh...

Now I know,
and I'm happy for you, honestly.

What are you doing here?

Uh, I mean...

I'm trying to help, I guess.

And I, I see that you're in love
and the two of you have this thing...

Excuse me, how did she get it?

She doesn't look like
an ex-fighter.

Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, dear.

How rude of me
to not even introduced myself.

I'm Evelyn, his wife...

Oh, fuck.

I, I'm sorry. I didn't... I forgot!

Evelyn, stop. Stop.
The touching and...

Listen. What...

We could fix this, whatever you want.
I mean, um... You want me to sign something?

Okay...
No, no. Easy, easy.

The important thing is that
we get the best out of this fight.

Yeah.
Right?

Wow.

I don't know what to say.
You haven't sounded like this in years.

Right.

I guess, I'm, uh... I'm almost normal.

Yeah.

Well, that's the other problem you have.

That was his sister.

Hey.

I came to apologise,
but the timing was bad.

Oh. It's all right.

Yesterday,
I looked a guy right in the eyes.

When he walked past me,
we almost touched shoulders.

You're still taking your pills?

Yeah, I think that's the reason.

You won't quit the fight, right?

No.

It's a win-win for all of us,
you know that.

That's the only reason
I had to act like that with Evelyn...

And become like them.

No, I'm getting better.

You're just losing yourself.
No.

Oh! Gosh.

Are you okay?

Jana, what happened?

I hit the lamppost, Dad.
Nothing new.

I'll drive you
to the pharmacy.

We got
to get her checked out.

Just me. Aaron stays.

Hey.

Don't follow.
We are different now.

<i>* Another world is an open door
And I feel no love *</i>

<i>* Another world is a lonely road
And I feel no love *</i>

<i>* The mistakes that I've made
Have gone back to blame my soul *</i>

<i>* All the chances I'll never take
They're here to come and go *</i>

<i>* I feel mistaken *</i>

<i>* And I was faking *</i>

<i>* But I need your hand *</i>

<i>* To get me through this life *</i>

Mr. Hunter?

I asked you a question.

I'm sorry, I...
I was thinking about something else.

Why did you accept this fight?

Well, I said I'd do the fight
to help out Bobby and his family.

You agreed to do this fight

in order to help your opponent
and his family?

I'm sorry, man. I know...
I... I shouldn't have said...

Aaron...
Mr. Hunter.

No, it's just that we didn't rehearse
this part... the question.

The conversation
is only between the two of us.

Take it easy.
It's okay.

Hey, just answer
the question, Aaron.

Can you please answer my question?

You agreed to do this fight

in order to help
your opponent and his family?

I didn't want to do it for myself.

Me and Bobby, we're a lot alike,

only I've been able to achieve
almost everything he's always wanted.

And it came easy for me.

I didn't even enjoy my success.

I keep thinking that...

I've gotten way too much out of life.

That's why I keep living with this...

sense of guilt.

So I figured, uh... in order to feel good,

I should not do it for myself.

I need to do something for someone else.

And I've achieved a lot.

But, hey, listen,
I never really had a family.

And since I've been...

Since I've come here...

I started feeling something
very close to that.

I guess you know I forget stuff.

Big chunks of my life are...

missing.

People say your memory is what makes you...

what you are.

That, uh...

That's the reason to keep living.

If I can't remember, at least...

at least I have people around
that remember me.

Life. Nothing else.

Work accident, injury, life.

Michael, tell me what I don't know,
or I swear...

Aaron has punch-drunk syndrome.

He takes pills for Alzheimer's,
but it's damaging his brain...

I know what it is, Michael.
What do you want from me?

For 15 years, I've been his nanny.

I have no life. I have nobody.

He couldn't do anything without me.
Then he blows it all to shit.

I lost everything I got.

No one wanted to hire me
after what happened to Aaron.

And right now, I'm just a babysitter
to a retarded kid.

Don't say that.

You don't know what it's like.
I don't?

You don't.
I don't know what it's like?

Bobby, stop it.

The chances of that happening are minimal.

Look, me and Michael,
we gave our lives to Aaron.

Don't you think
if something happened to him,

we don't deserve to get any recognition
for our efforts?

Recognition?

You could always end the fight
by submitting him or something.

He would remember to tap out?

You think he's that rational?

I came from the hall.

Aaron is... I don't know how to...

I want to have nothing
to do with this anymore.

Uh-huh.

Remember what your grandma
used to tell me when you were little?

She used to say,

"Why do you want to punish her?
She is in her own world."

How do you know that's wrong there?

How do you know about his? Or ours?

What's wrong? Why are you sitting?

Don't know. It's all good.
Ah.

Why are you so stiff?
Do I have to deal with you too now?

What do you mean?

Doesn't matter. Come on!

Faster! What are you?
What am I?

What?
What am I?

You are a state champion! Say it!

I'm a champion.
Louder!

I'm a champion.
Louder!

I'm a champion.
Louder!

I'm a mean motherfucker!
I'm a mean motherfucker!

I'll destroy anyone who comes in my way!
I will destroy anyone...

I'm a terminator!
I'm a terminator!

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the main event of the evening.

In the red corner, we have
a fighter with a professional record

of seven wins, two losses
and one no contest.

Fighting out of Bansko, Bulgaria,

Borislav "Good Night" Tumbev!

In the blue corner,

please, give it up for the fighter
with the professional record

of 52 wins and only eight defeats.

The MMA legend,
fighting out of Brooklyn, New York,

Aaron "Lionheart" Hunter!

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Our tale of the tape is here.

As you can see, Hunter is taller
and has a slight reach advantage.

Tumbev is ten years younger, though.

Yes,
but that doesn't help his Efbet odds.

Six to one for him being the underdog
and Hunter the favourite.

Fighters, please come up.

The referee looks like
he's ready to start, but...

Aaron Hunter seems
a little distracted, don't you think?

Could he be in love?

Okay. Protect yourself at all times.

Follow my instructions.

If you don't have any questions,
touch gloves,

and let's go.

Fighter, are you ready?
Yes.

Fighter, are you ready?

Fight!

And the fight is underway!

Tumbev attacks.

But Hunter is really acting weird.

Don't hold back.

Fight!

Fight!

Tumbev! Tumbev! Tumbev!

Come on!

Come on, Aaron! Defend yourself!

Come on, listen to me! Defend yourself.

Stop.

And that is the end
of the most devastating round to watch

in the history of this sport.

Well, if you're calling this a sport,

I think you might've been watching
something else.

Come on, man, fight!

Hunter is going
to his opponent's corner.

Tell me something...
Aaron, what are you doing?

Go back.

It looks like
he's talking to him.

We have to fight.
We're gonna lose everything.

You don't understand...
Go back! Go back!

If you don't start
fighting, the people will...

Want their money back. I know.

I have never seen
anything like this before.

I think we'll be seeing that
more than once tonight.

Aaron?

Aaron?

Fight!

If you don't attack,
this fight will be a no contest.

Fight.

Nobody wants to hear you sing, Aaron.

Evelyn's going to take your money.

Michael is going to disappear.

My sister doesn't care about you either!

So start fighting, you idiot!

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I can't survive, I can't stay alive *</i>

<i>* Without your love *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way, no *</i>

<i>* I can't exist *</i>

<i>* I'll surely miss your tender kiss *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way, no *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* I'm a broken man with empty hands *</i>

<i>* Oh, baby, please, please *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* Baby, my heart is full of love
And desire for you *</i>

<i>* Now come on down
And do what you've got to do *</i>

<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

<i>* Now can't you see it's burning
Out of control *</i>

<i>* Just come down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

<i>* Free, free *</i>

<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

<i>* 'Cause it would be wrong *</i>

<i>* To string along with love so true *</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,
due to illegal actions,

Aaron Hunter is disqualified,

and the winner
is Borislav "Good Night" Tumbev.

<i>And as they say,
that's all she wrote.</i>

<i>Good night.</i>

<i>That's all she wrote.</i>

<i>Where did that saying come from, anyway?</i>

<i>Let tell you the story I heard.</i>

<i>During the Second World War,</i>

<i>it wasn't uncommon
for an overseas service man</i>

<i>to receive a brief, cutting letter
from a girlfriend</i>

<i>telling him that their romance was over,</i>

<i>and that she'd found someone else
in his absence.</i>

<i>When questioned by his buddies,</i>

<i>the anguished soldier
would give a response</i>

<i>that became so common
it entered our language</i>

<i>as meaning "It's over."</i>

<i>Nowadays, fight commentators
use this in cases just like this.</i>

<i>I mean, not just like this,</i>

<i>a freaked out fighter who beats the shit
out of everyone in the ring,</i>

<i>but a regular knockout.</i>

<i>Anyway, I think you got the point.</i>

Yes, mother. No, she's...

Okay, just calm down. We'll find her.

I'll bring her back. I promise.

I really thought he was getting better.

The strange thing is that
the meds don't work anymore.

Sorry you had to come all this way, but...

If it wasn't for me,
Aaron wouldn't be here.

I'll admit, he doesn't show
any signs of aggression,

but we need a relative
or a close friend to vouch for him.

His wife and his manager think
it will be good idea

for him to stay here a while,
and, quite frankly, I agree with them.

So I just can't release him to you
because you want me to.

Are there any cameras here in the office?

Uh, no.

Wait, wait! I'm not crazy! Wait.

Or maybe I am.

So...

It's all I won from the fight.
It's in US dollars.

And it's all I've got, Doc.

I've been working here 17 years.

I make sure the "strange" people
don't bother the normal ones.

The longer I spend with my patients, the...

the worse I feel.

Are we normal? Who are we to judge?

After all, I deeply doubt that any of them
would do what I'm about to do.

You've been here all morning.
I heard your whole wacked-out story.

Could you tell me, please,

why would you waste my time instead
of starting straight off with this?

<i>* Someone once told me that *</i>

<i>* Love is often blind *</i>

<i>* And as I wait for life to pass *</i>

<i>* I should just take my time *</i>

<i>* To know that I, I'm just a servant *</i>

<i>* And I'm listening for my cue *</i>

<i>* If I'm faithful and I'm certain *</i>

<i>* I'd be blessed
To sing this song with you *</i>

<i>* Someone told me about our love *</i>

<i>* Could chase away the fear *</i>

<i>* Something from the light above *</i>

<i>* Whisper like an angel in my ear *</i>

<i>* That I, I'm just a soul child *</i>

<i>* Trying to find my way *</i>

<i>* Searching for a little joy *</i>

<i>* To spread throughout my day *</i>

<i>* Ooh, ooh, ooh, *</i>

<i>* Hey, hey *</i>

<i>* Alright, yeah *</i>

<i>* Someone told me have some faith *</i>

<i>* The creator has a master plan *</i>

<i>* The truest love should never wait *</i>

<i>* Let our spirit shine and take a stand *</i>

<i>* Keep your head up strong *</i>

<i>* Just stay open to the solitude *</i>

<i>* And if I'm faithful and I'm certain *</i>

<i>* I'll be blessed
To sing this song with you *</i>

<i>* With you *</i>

<i>* Sun is so golden I'm gonna try
And meet with madness *</i>

<i>* Always in my reverie without one tune *</i>

<i>* Complacency, I'm gonna chime in
And strike up a tune *</i>

<i>* Not one, like I would cling on
But sing *</i>

<i>* Floaty and well hung
I'll stop for one song *</i>

<i>* With that said, gotta stay down
And I'll commit murderous mistakes *</i>

<i>* And forgive myself if I fail
You will be embarrassed for me *</i>

<i>* For I simply do not have the time *</i>

<i>* You will make a prodigious effort
To stop me *</i>

<i>* But I will become stuck on your arm
Like a fox, baby *</i>

<i>* Hard to shake and easy to lose *</i>

<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

<i>* 'Cause I can see the duplicity *</i>

<i>* If your one half wants to judge *</i>

<i>* While the other just wants to be free *</i>

<i>* To be free, to be free *</i>

<i>* To be free *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

<i>I thought Aaron
and Jana were going to change.</i>

<i>I was wrong.</i>

<i>The old problems came back.</i>

But that's nothing new.

<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

<i>* Can you hear me singing? *</i>

<i>* Whoa, yeah *</i>

<i>* Whoa, yeah *</i>

<i>* And if I'm patient and I'm thankful *</i>

<i>* I'll be blessed
To sing this song for you *</i>

<i>* I see the wrong and right *</i>

<i>* Never choose a side *</i>

<i>* Runnin' on red, not black and white *</i>

<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

<i>* When they all need me *</i>

<i>* I wanna do it *</i>

<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

<i>* Instead, I listen *</i>

<i>* But now I'm different *</i>

<i>* Found room to grow *</i>

<i>* Gonna kick the pieces of my shell now *</i>

<i>* Start a brand new story *</i>

<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

<i>* This is what I'm all about *</i>

<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

<i>* The better part of me *</i>

<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

<i>* I can see wrong and right
Never choose a side *</i>

<i>* Runnin' on red, not black and white *</i>

<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

<i>* No, no *</i>

<i>* No, no *</i>

<i>* No, no *</i>

<i>* No, no *</i>

<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

<i>* The better part of me *</i>

<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>
