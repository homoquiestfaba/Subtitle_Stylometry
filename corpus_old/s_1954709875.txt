There's a story that has been

passed down for centuries,

from father to son.

Legend has it a
certain man came

to live in the
village of Gladbury.

He was a good-hearted man,

devoted to his
family and his craft.

The candle maker brought
light to the entire village.

But he longed to give them more.

Life was hard in Gladbury,

and the people had
become disheartened.

the candle maker worked,

pouring his heart and
his prayers into each candle.

But on the first
Sunday of Advent,

all he had left to give...
was a single prayer,

not for himself, but for
Gladbury, for his son,

and for all the sons
and daughters to come.

Silence was the only answer
he would receive that night.

Or so it seemed.

blessed a single candle.

The heavenly gift was given
to the ones who needed it most,

with the simple instruction:

Light this and pray.

hoped for an answered prayer.

But what they
received was a miracle.

On Christmas Eve,
the village rejoiced

upon hearing of
their change of fortune,

for such things do happen.

And from them, legends are born.

As the tale is told,
every twenty-five years,

the angel visits
The Haddington Chandlery,

and every time
a prayer is answered.

But even the greatest
stories must come to an end.

Much has changed
in two hundred years.

In a world illuminated
by modern marvels,

who needs the
light of a simple candle?

[bustling about and voices]

[YOUNG BOY]
I'm starving.

How are you'! Hello.

How we doing'! Alright?

Yeah, very good, yeah.

Hope they'll be bringing
some more soon.

Bless you little lady.

ls it soup again'!

God bless you, sir.

[MISS FOSTER] There's no
longer a place for you here!

Please!

[MISS FOSTER] I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

Orders came straight
from the top.

[MISS FOSTER]
You should learn to keep your

affections to yourself,
Ruth Goodchild!

[MISS FOSTER] And don't even
think about coming back!

[WOMAN PASSERBY]
Serves you right.

[Ruth begins to weep]

Abner, will you take
over for a second?

Yes. God bless you, sir.

[Ruth weeping]

Hello, miss.

Miss.

What do you want'!

I only mean to help.

Palace, Miss Goodchild.

But you'll be safe here.

And with three meals
a day, you won't go hungry.

When the baby comes, what then'!

Well, perhaps there's someone...

No.There's nobody.

Or rather there was,
but he found someone else

and dismissed me
from work today.

Don't lose hope, miss.

We'll find a place
for you and your baby.

God bless you, sir.

[LADY CAMDON]
Reverend Richmond?

Friend of yours?

I have no idea.

God bless you.

Reverend David Richmond.

So you really
have left the pulpit.

Nonsense.This is my pulpit now.

Soup, soap, and salvation.

And please,
I'm only known as David here.

Have we met?

We might have, had you not
rejected my last three letters.

Ah, yes, Lady Camdon
of Gladbury, in the flesh.

But I'm sorry that you've
traveled so far only

to hear me decline your
offer once again.

My place is here,
helping the needy.

You, sir, have you
heard this man preach?

Can't say that I have.

[LADY CAMDON] Villagers
flocked to London to hear him.

I once sat by a fisherman
who rode his boat

twelve miles for one sermon.

It was along time ago.

But I'll never forget.

David Richmond, miracle man.

In the midst of
my own great loss,

it was your words
that revived my faith.

Any able bodied man
can serve a bowl of soup,

but few men have
a gift like yours.

My only hope is that
you choose to serve

where your gift is needed most.

God bless you.


should think about it, David.

God bless you.Well done, sir.

That's it, take a bowl.

Sorry.

your recent visit was a

timely reminder of
the life I left behind.

Though tragedy has
altered my course,

I can no longer stray from
my calling in the pulpit.

I humbly accept the offer
to serve your parish in the

place of the late
Reverend Pillington.

I shall arrive in Gladbury
the Friday before Advent.

Yours truly, David Richmond.

Come on, boy!

Come on! Move on!

You silly old thing. Come on!

Move on!

Come on!

Might I offer you
some assistance?

Thank you, I'm quite capable!

Well, if it wouldn't be too
forward of me, I could--

No!

I'm not a sack of potatoes.

Come on!

Come on, boy. Come on!

I don't need your help.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Miss Barstow.

I'm headed to London
by way of Gladbury.

And the people of Gladbury,

they allow a lady to

It's the Christmas season.
The whole town's in a fuss.

with the new minister

Reverend High and

I hope they dislike

Thank you. I hate to be indebted
to anyone, much less a stranger.

It's an easy debt to forgive.

Mighty" at your service.

Reverend. How providential.

Oh, we shall see.

Might you have
any words of advice?

Yes.

Retreat.

Walk on.

Very well then.
I look forward to

seeing you at
church on Sunday!

[Emily laughs]

Walk on.

Thank you Ebenezer.

<i>REM Hurry up, Edward.</i>

We don't want the new
minister thinking the

Haddingtons are a pair
of village bumpkins.

Codswallop my dear,
you look lovely.

I come from a long line of
bumpkins, and I'm proud of it.

Who wouldn't love

He's here!

There he is!

Oh here, allow me.

<i>Um.</i>

Oh, you haven't heard of us.

That's alright,

Lovely to see you.

Welcome to Gladbury, Reverend.

But on a candlestick.

And it giveth light unto

Let your light
so shine before men.

That they may
see your good works.

And glorify your Father,
which is in Heaven.

Thank you Reverend.

Is he talking about
our Christmas Candle?

I think he's gettin' to it.

You sir!

Would you hide this
candle under a bushel?

No sir, I wouldn't.

Of course not.

And you, Mrs. Haddington?

Would you conceal
this candle under your hat?

Lovely as it is.

No, no, never.

Reverend Richmond.

Lady Camdon.

What a fascinating sermon.

Thank you.

And I imagine her ladyship

Well, I can think of no
better way to preserve

the legacy of the
Christmas Candle.

Forgive my ignorance, but what
is this Christmas Candle?

I think you'll find everything
you're looking for in here.

This is preposterous!

I thought you might
stop by, Reverend.

Tea?

Had I known that the people
of this town were expecting

to hear such fairy
tales from the pulpit,

I never would have come!

The Christmas Candle is
no fairy tale, I assure you.

that you have seen

this magical wish
granting angel'!

<i>No.</i>

But he has.

Do I have some
questions for you.

Why one Christmas Candle,
and not fifteen?

Why doesn't this angel
come once every year?

Or every Thursday
afternoon for tea?

And why in all of God's
green Earth, Gladbury'!

Why Bethlehem?

Why a babe in a manger?

Who could possibly hope to
understand the ways of the Lord'!

But I see no reason to
promote superstitions

or raise false hopes.

[LADY CAMDON] People of
Gladbury lead difficult lives.

Even the slightest hope of a
miracle keeps their faith alive.

Only to be crushed when
their prayers go unanswered.

If this is what your
people need, then I--

[LADY CAMDON]
What our people need is hope.

And you can give it to them.

I know this firsthand.

Lady Camdon, I'm not the

We're just grateful we've

Welcome.

The first candle of Advent
is the candle of hope.

But hope in what?

An answered prayer? A miracle?

A Christmas Candle?

I'm told that tonight

of this remarkable tradition.

Isn't that right Mr. Haddington?

Yes, it is.

But for my benefit, who here has
put in a request for the candle?

surely not everyone

can receive the
Christmas Candle.

And yet we all have needs.

So what hope do we have?

Will we abandon our faith?

Fall into despair?

Hm'! I hope not.

And I dare say
that we will not!

We light this candle to remind
us that our hope does not

come from earthly things,
but from above.

From the God who came to us
one starry night in Bethlehem,

and promises to
come again one day.

And that,
good people of Gladbury,

them for generations:

And we won't let it go to waste!

to give you Bible lessons.

[William coughs]

Hello, Charlie.

Why don't we start with the
Gospel of John chapter one.

"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

and the Word was God.

The same was in
the beginning with God.

All things were made by him;

and without him was not any
thing made that was made.

In him was life; and the
life was the light of men.

And the light
shineth in darkness;

and the darkness
comprehend it not."

"And the impediment
to his tongue was loosed,

and he spoke plainly."

Now Charlie, we are going
to loose that tongue of yours.

Open wide.

<i>And...</i>

Very good.

<i>And...</i>

Louder.

[nonsensical sounds]

Louder.

Light this and pray, Charlie.

Even if it's only in your heart.

God will hear you.

Good morning, Mr. Finch.

What brings you to our home?

I wondered if
I might be of service.

Reverend, meet my family.

My wife, Delilah.

Hello.

Children.

This is my father, Oliver.

The new reverend!

Over here, Dad.

Come on.

Don't suppose you
could help the old man

get his hands on the
Christmas Candle?

Maybe put in a word
to the Haddingtons.

Hogwash.

The next time I see,
I hope to be

looking at the Good
Lord himself.

In the meantime, I'll walk
by faith, right Reverend?

Right.

Oh thank you.Thank you so much!

It'll be a happy
Christmas after all!

Remember, children,
this is our little secret.

Reverend Richmond! Do come in.

I've been praying for
company, Reverend.

when I can meet the need?

So you'll find me a
knitting companion?

<i>I... shall.</i>

Coming!

Don't waste a candle
on an old man like me.

Oliver, there's no such
thing as a wasted prayer.

Of course I do.

Welcome everyone.

We light the second candle
of Advent in the love of God.

During Advent,
God pierces the darkness

of the world with
divine light and love.

Because he loved us, he sent
his son to light the way.

Though we must wait
for Christmas day,

we must not wait to love
one another as Christ did.

Well why not be that miracle?

That's a lot of food, Reverend.

Well, you have a

That's beautiful.

the third candle of Advent,

the candle of joy.

When Christ was born,
God used angels to proclaim

"good tidings of great joy."

To all mankind.

Now, we are the messengers
of this good news.

For with every good deed,
every act of kindness,

Christ is born again
and again in our lives.

Now let us go forth,

Indeed. Now this I have to see.

Think of Herbert. No cumbersome

You of all people should

You could use a lighter load.

Well, <i>I...</i> I imagine that

Edward!

I have a feeling Edward.

I have a feeling
this is the one.

The Christmas Candle.

What are you suggesting?

I'm not suggesting anything.

I'm... asking.

[knock at the door]

Mr. Haddington.

Reverend.

I regret to inform
you that St. Mark's

no longer requires your candles.

But that's a standing order.

It has been for
two hundred years.

It's standing no more,
I'm afraid.

But I just delivered
three crates.

Yes,thank you,
but we only need one.

<i>But... but--</i>

it's for the good of Gladbury.

about the good of Gladbury?

This is our legacy,
and he's meddling with it.

I say we light the candle
right now. We've earned it.

We're going to
give this candle away.

To whom'!

Of course.

<i>â™ª</i>

God bless you, sir.
God bless you, ma'am.

These are ready to go.

Give us a hand.

May I help you?

Um, we're here to

And you are?

We're his parents.

We have a gift for our son.

In my short time in Gladbury,
I have seen many miracles.

I have seen angels at work.

I have seen them on the
rooftops, at kitchen tables,

and in this very sanctuary.

In fact, I see these angels now.

Mr. Hardy Collins.

Dear Ms. Leonard.

Herbert Hopewell. And every
single one of you who has

allowed the light of
Christ to shine through

your good works this
Advent season.

From what I've read
of Gladbury': past,

this town has
glowed with a certain

miraculous light
for generations.

But today marks the dawning
of a new age in Gladbury.

in centuries to come,

our beloved church will
shine even brighter still.

Ghastly.

It's witchcraft! Witchcraft

Reverend!

Miss Barstow.

It's my father.
He's called for you.

You're alright, Father.

Pray for me, Reverend.

God'll do the rest.

Right, Reverend?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

to say for yourself'!

I'm sorry, but I can't give your
father what he's asking for.

All he wants is--

I know what he wants.

Then give it to him.

You're a minister;
he's a dying man.

You can't give him
a simple prayer?

Look, if it's so simple,
then why don't you do it?

I don't believe in miracles.

The fourth candle of Advent,
our last before Christmas Eve,

represents the peace of God,
who passes all understanding.

In the coming days of Christmas,

let us be instruments
of this peace,

Shining light where
there is darkness,

hope where there is despair,

sowing joy where
there is sadness...

...and faith where
there is doubt.

You asked me
to fill your pulpit,

and instead
I emptied your church.

You mustn't take all the credit.

I did ask you to come.

I am a man of faith,
Lady Camdon.

I believe God worked
in the appointed time.

But in our modern age,
the lame don't walk,

blind men do not see,
and the sick die.

But sometimes they live.

Walk with me, Reverend.

[LADY CAMDON]
Twenty-five years ago,

our town suffered
great hardship.

That's when the Haddingtons gave

The candle to
Reverend Pillington.

But when he lit
the candle to pray...

...well, he nearly burned
the vestry to the ground.

The poor dear was in despair,

and then, within
the church walls,

a treasure was discovered,

several gold crosses
and a ruby brooch.

A hidden treasure?

Well, had it not
been for the fire,

it would've remained hidden.

And thankfully, there was just
enough to repair the church

And to provide for Gladbury's

impoverished
families that winter.

The very first
Christmas Candle

went to my
great-great-great-grandmother.

Once she was a
hopeless orphan, and then...

Miracles are part of
our inheritance, Reverend.

Tell that to Mrs. Hopewell.

I believe you'll find
Mrs. Hopewell': faith to be much

stronger than the grief
she's feeling now.

Your doubts don't
trouble me, Reverend.

On the contrary,
they inspire my faith.

It's a carriage

In all my days...

Bea! It's Thomas!

It's Thomas.

Oh, look at you,
handsome and fancy!

That carriage of yours!

It's called a Stanley Steamer,
one of the first of its kind.

I had it shipped from America.

I'm not staying, Father.

Oh, not staying, don't be silly.

I'm married, Mother.

I'm on the way to
meet her family now.

Getting married.

Name's Priscilla.
She's the daughter of a baron.

Oh! And, are you happy?

I'm finally making a name
for myself, for the family.

Business is expanding,

and one day I'll
introduce you to Priscilla.

Why did you come?

I know how much this candle
means to you, to Gladbury,

but it's lost on me.

You must light it and pray,
and then you'll see.

See what, Mother?

A miracle?

Gladbury needs you, son.

The world needs me.

I'm lighting up entire cities.

It was good to see you.

Both of you.

Merry Christmas.

Thomas, the miracles, the angel,
you saw it with your own eyes.

I was a child. I saw
what I wanted to see.

Goodbye.

Thomas.

Reverend.

I would like to see your father.

[William coughing]

Father. Father.

Mr. Barstow, if I may.

pass that a certain

blind man sat by the
wayside begging,

He cried, "Jesus, thou Son of
David, have mercy on me."

And Jesus said unto him,

"What wilt though that
I should do unto thee?"

The blind man said unto him,

"Lord, that I might
receive my sight."

And Jesus said, "Go thy way;
thy faith has made thee whole."

And immediately
he received his sight

and followed Jesus in the way.

Did I not say to you
that if you would believe,

You would see the glory of God.

And they took away
the stone from the

place where the
dead man was lying,

and Jesus lifted up
his eyes and said,

"Father, I thank you
that you have heard..."

And these are written
that you might believe

that Jesus is the
Christ, the son of God,

and that in believing,
you might have life.

Behold there came a leper
and worshipped him,

"Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean."

And Jesus put forth his hand...

My little daughter is
at the point of death.

I pray thee, Lord,
come and lay hands on her,

that she might be healed.

If I may but touch his
garment, I shall be whole.

If thou canst believe, all
things are possible to him...

The father of
the child cried out,

"Lord, I believe,
help my unbelief!"

And he said to her,
"Damsel, arise."

And they were astonished,
a great astonishment.

Speak the word,
and my servant shall be here.

And Jesus said unto them,
"Thy faith has made you whole."

I prayed. I even
believed for a miracle.

But God did nothing.

Oh, David.

certain, and then it was gone.

There was a time
when I could not...

...utter a prayer or step
foot in a church.

I believe I've made
my peace with God.

But still I was a
different man before.

The love I shared,
the hope I had...

Some things,
they cannot be restored.

I do hope you're wrong.

Such a hope is too great a risk.

But I wonder what you
risk living without it.

I should go.

[Emily sobs]

Bea.

He won't light it.
I'll light it for him.

It's of no use.

Anyway, we don't even
know if it's the right one.

Well then we'll find out.

We did everything we knew to do.

We gave away every last candle,
and this one came back.

Twice.

This could be
our miracle, Edward.

I hope I'm not overstepping
my boundaries,

but I know just the person to
give the candle to this year.

David Richmond.

Think of it, Edward.

Your father gave the candle
to Reverend Pillington.

And as we know, David is a far
greater wretch than he ever was.

Don't tell me you've
given the candle away.

This is the candle,
isn't it'! Splendid.

Then we're in agreement?

I don't think--

the candle to David.

Good.

[LADY CAMDON] Lord knows,
he could use a little light.

But he doesn't
even believe in the candle.

Edward.

Edward, please!

Mr. Haddington.

May I have a word'!

The Christmas Candle.

You're giving the candle to me?

weren't the first choice.

What am I to do with it.

Just light it and...
just light it.

Just do something
good for Gladbury.

Emily.

In church.

And on your own accord.

It's true.

Am I to think that
you've come to believe?

I don't know.

I want to.

In times like this,
it would be comforting.

Don't think less of me.

I have a problem.

Cousin Charlie was given
this blasted Christmas Candle,

and the poor boy
has given it to me.

Who could refuse
a gift like that?

Now all I can do is pray.

I feel as though
I owe it to him.

That is a problem.

[banging on door]

Yes, yes, I'm coming.

Reverend Richmond, Miss Barstow.

Mr. Haddington, a word.

Reverend!

Miss Barstow!

Is there a problem?

A great and wondrous miracle

has taken place this
Christmas season.

It seems that the angel
has blessed not one,

but two Christmas
Candles this year.

And now that I think of it,
how small is my faith,

to think that this angel
might stop at two.

Why not three or four?

Or maybe there are no
limits to the blessings

the Good Lord might
bestow upon Gladbury.

Well, we can explain.

Edward tripped, and then--

you came around.

There was an accident.

Yes, we'd lost the candle.

So I said, "Why don't we
give all the candles?"

Bea.

And Edward said--

We meant no harm.

But you've given us false hope.

Surely you can see that.

How could you?

How could you question my
intentions for the people of

Gladbury when you, yourselves
so blatantly misled them?

I fear this Christmas will end
in nothing but disappointment,

And you and your fairy
tales are to blame.

[Bea gasps]

Perhaps it was providence
that kept me in Gladbury.

<i>â™ª</i>

Well, here we are again.

Thank you, Mrs. Hopewell.

I can never repay you.

I know what it is
to suffer a great loss.

Allow me, Reverend.

It's time.

On Christmas Eve, we light
the final candle of Advent,

the Christ Candle, for only
in Christ do we find the hope,

love, joy, and peace that we
have come to know this season.

Christmas Eve
holds a special place

in the heart of every believer,

and nowhere is this more true
than in the town of Gladbury.

Many of you have no
doubt come to rejoice

in the miracle of the
Christmas Candle.

But regretfully,
tonight you shall see this

long-standing tradition
come to an end.


Father?

I would now like to ask
the recipient of the

Christmas Candle
to please stand.


ever I see the urgent need

to speak on the virtue
of enduring faith,

a faith that endures

disappointment, and
unanswered prayer.

A faith that relies not on
the hollow promises of men,

but on the sovereignty
of Almighty God.

<i>I...</i>

<i>I...</i>

I've got something to say!

[gasps and chatter]

I can speak!

[joyful voices]

I prayed. Every day I prayed,

And then I woke up this
morning, and I could talk.

I don't understand it.
I even gave my candle away.

But my favorite scripture says,

"With God,
all things are possible."

Now I'm never going to stop
talking, especially about this!


I don't know how this happened,

but my wife also received
the Christmas Candle.

For my husband.

As many of you know,
I was stuck on the bottle.

Like never before, I prayed.

And I found I was
drinking less and less.

Which really is a miracle.


I was hopeless.

I'd lost everything.

And now, nothing': lost at all.

It's all been found.


[MR. FINCH] I've been out
of a job for some time now,

and found myself
in debt up to my ears.

But then, our landlady--

[MRS. FINCH] She forgave
us our debts in full.

[MR. FINCH] And if
that wasn't enough,

well I found work
at the Leonard house.

It makes a man feel good to
provide for his family again.

And my wife, she's found
a good friend in Ms. Leonard.

[MRS. FINCH]
Yes, this dear woman,

she's taught our kids to knit.

[laughs and applause]

My name's Joe.

I'm not really a religious man.

I asked for the candle,
and it's saved my cat.

It may not seem much, but
she means a great deal to me.

I never thought I'd get
the Christmas Candle,

but thank God I did.


for me old man, Oliver Barber.

He was blind.

As you may have heard,
dad died this morning.

he left us, he whispered,

"I can see."

"I can see." His prayer was
answered,just as he'd hoped.

He saw Jesus.

When I received the candle,

I thought my prayer'd
be answered one way,

so I took a step of faith.

Only it was in
the wrong direction.

But then I stumbled into
the arms of Hardy Collins,

the man of my dreams,

and just this morning,
he asked me to be his wife.

[excited gasps]

My answer's yes!

I don't know what to say,

except I prayed for
my father, and here he is.

to my sister in ten years.

I even stopped coming
to church because of her.

But we both
received the candle...

So Reverend, have you changed
your mind about Gladbury?

I'm afraid this has only
confirmed my suspicions.

How can you not believe?

I believe...
but I do not belong.



Quite a night.

More than I could have imagined.

I know he'll come back, Edward.

Not tonight. Maybe not until
after we've both gone,

but I don't have
to see it to believe

that our son will
come home again.

Dear Lady Camdon,

Charlie...

to leave his mark on a parish,

but truth be told, Gladbury
has left its mark on me.

In spite of my best efforts,

I witnessed many miracles
this Advent season.

None more remarkable than
my own change of heart.

If you will have me, I will be
honored to remain in Gladbury,

for many Christmases to come.

Congratulations.

David Richmond.

Ah, the Reverend Richmond.

Happy Christmas.

Happy Christmas to you.

I don't quite know what to say,

except for there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

Let me take that.

about this all along?

I had an inkling, but I didn't
know for sure until

Ruth confirmed
Thomas was the father.

Are you ready?

meet your grandchild.

Ruth, this is Mr. and Mrs.
Haddington,Thomas' parents.

I hardly know what to say.

He has your eyes.

Have you named him?

I'd like to name
him after my father.

He looks like an Edward.

Isn't that a fine name?

May I?

Our grandson.

Edward.

Emily!

I was hoping, uh...

Yes;

I was hoping that we might
spend Christmas together.

Your first
Christmas in Gladbury.

And your last.

Gladbury has a funny
way of keeping people.

I used to mind it.
I don't anymore.

Forgive me.The moment
seemed providential.

I'll be seeing you

in church from now on?
