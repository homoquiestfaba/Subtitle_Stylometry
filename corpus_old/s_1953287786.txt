You're gonna love

Yeah.

I still don't
get what's so fun

about freezing your as
s off in the snow.

[ laughs ]

Oh, I got you
something.

It's called
a vacation I.O.U.

I know this isn't exactly
what you had in mind,

so for our next big trip,

I'm promising you
a tropical paradise.

So when
we go back home,

I'm, uh, thinking abou
t going over to Henry's.

.
I'm gonna ask him
if I could bartend
a few nights again

Yeah, sure, up to you.

Thank you for coming
out here with me.

I love you.

Okay, we're head
ed nine or ten mile
s that way.

We're just gonna
take the truck

right through there?

No, we're gonna
leave it here.

Just need to get
the snowmobile
to the snow

n.
and hitch the tent o

You know how to do that?

Yeah, the guys
at the rental sh
op showed me.

It's easy.

Sure you don't
just want to set up
shop right here?

No way.

We just head nine,
ten miles that way,

we can see
the whole valley
from there.

Be awesome. Come on.

[ music ]

[ engine stops ]

?
Is this it

No, we still have
to go a ways that way.

Just gonna mark our path
with these guys

so we can find
our way back to the truck.

Do you have plans
on getting us lost

[ laughs ] Stop it.

Just marking our path

like Hansel and Gretel
and the breadcrumbs.

Please tell me
we're not taking

survival notes
from a children's book

[ flies buzzing ]

Oh!

Shit!

What the hell is this?

MIKE:
It's fine. It's probably
just a hunting area.

Oh, my God,
this is seriously sick.

It's not sick.

You've just never
been hunting before.

It's what people do.

Okay. Well, can we get
the hell out of here?

Yeah.

Eww.

[ wind whistling ]

[ sighs ]

I thought you said
you've done this before.

Everyone's built
a tent before.

I've never built
a tent before.

Well, why
don't you help me?

Can you grab that?

Think
I'm just gonna get

the instruction manual,

Watch where you're going.

I have never seen 
you do anything handy
in my entire life,

put something
in the microwave.

But you're gonna
build this tent.

Yeah, I am.

Okay, Davy Crockett.

Where's the thermos?

In the black bag there.

I'm gonna put th

Okay, do it, 'cause
you're not really helping.

We're not near
those dead animals, are we

No, a couple
of miles back.

I have to go
to the bathroom.

Just don't go

Anywhere else you like.

Okay, um, I'll go back

Worst case scenario,

It would be a pain

I don't know!

!
I don't even know
where we are, Mike

I know, I know.

We'll be fine, okay?

We didn't tell anybo

Okay, fine

Okay.

I'm pregnant.

I took two tests yesterday,

and I took two tests
this morning.

I don't know
what to say.

You don't have

I'm not keeping it, so...

an?
What's that
supposed to me

It means
exactly what it means.

I'm not having the baby.

I'm not--I'm not gonna
keep the baby, so...

we don't really have
to talk about it anymore.

Yeah, um..

fine.

It's your decision

Good night, Mike.

Oh!

No.

I think we should just
walk back to the truck

Can you just let me see
what I can do here?

[ wrench clanging ]

,
This is the first time
you've ever ridden one

so what makes you thin
k you could fix one?

Well, thank you
for that vote of confidence.

Shouldn't you be keeping
yourself warm or something?

[ scoffs ]

I'll be at the tent.

[ shivering ]

Hey!

Hey!

Um, we need help!

Uh, our snowmobile
wrecked.

My boyfriend,
he's right over there.

He's trying to fix it
right now,

but I feel like
if we could just have...

Mike! Mike!

Mike, I saw him!
What?

?
The guy--The guy that
I thought I saw before

He was right over there.

And I yelled and I sai
d that we needed help,

.
and he just walked off

Seriously?

He was looki
ng right at me.

Of course,
it's snowing again.

ay.
Ok

So which direction
did he go?

I didn't see,
'cause I turned arou
nd and he was gone.

You're sure
he was here?

Yes!

I don't see
any footprints.

I swear I saw him.

He was right over ther
e by those trees.

Is your head
feeling okay?

Are you serious?

What? I'm just
asking a question.

.
No, you think I'm
hallucinating or something

.
I saw a man over there

Okay,
I believe you, okay?

Look, I'm gonna go back
to the snowmobile.

Just let me know
if you see him again.

He might have
a vehicle

or a place where
we can call for help.

Do you think
it's the guy

s?
that killed
those animal

No, that's too far away.

He'd have no reason
to be out here.

Besides, we'd hear
a snowmobile or something.

I don't want to be
out here any longer.

k?
Could we just wa
lk back to the truc

Just let me go
see what I can do
with the snowmobile.

Mike, you don't
know anything
about snowmobiles.

,
This is the first time
you've ever driven one

without much luc
k, by the way.

Can you just adm
it you have no idea
how to fix it,

re?
and we can just ge
t the hell out of he

ke.
I'm not asking, Mi

Let's get the hell
out of here

and walk back
to the truck.

Fine, done.

We'll go
back to the truck.

[ music ]

.
There should b
e another marker

Where is it?

.
I don't know.
That's what I'm saying

.
We should have com
e across another one

So we're lost.

.
No, we're not lost

We've been following
the markers.

We just should hav
e found another one.

Let's just keep going
this way then.

.
I don't know
if this is the way

All right,
well, what about

the tracks
from yesterday?

em.
I don't see th

Okay, well, that should
have been a good indication

that we're going
the wrong way.

We're not going
the wrong way!

e.
The markers were her

Okay, well,
what about the map?

Where are we
on the map?

Well, we should be here,

but if we were here,
we would see the marker.

Well, let's just keep
going that way.

ay,
If this is the wrong w

we could end up
seriously lost.

So what
are you saying?

on,
I'm saying
it's gonna get dark so

s
and we should probab
ly follow our footprint

back to the tent.

Back to the tent?

The markers.
..
Mike, are you serious?

[ sighs ]

Okay, well, what about
a campsite or a ranger station?

There must be something
like that around here.

I mean, this is
a camping area, right?

.
No

What do you mean, no?

?
Not here, okay

What does that mean,
not here?

[ sighs ]

We're not gonna
run into anyone up her

We're camping
in the snow

in the middle

Is there really a need
to be more adventurous?

I just mean
that a campground

is for kids
and families and stuff

So I asked what would be
more exciting.

And he said out
in the middle of nowhere.

No, he said a local secr
et that's tourist-free.

Wearethe tourists!

You got to be
kidding me.

We're stuck out here.

No. We'll just
go back to the ten

No

What if he took
the ribbons off the trees?

What if he's messing with us?

I didn't know that was
such a bad quality to have

I'm sorry.

And stop apologizing!

Maybe for once,
tell me I'm wrong!

Tell me
I'm a bitch!

You always play this martyr
with these big plans

that never quite work out,

and then you'll blame it
on something like,

"Oh, everything happens
for a reason," or something.

Like this!
What made you think

you could just drive
into the middle of nowhere,

pitch a tent,
and it would just
all magically work out?

This just isn't
how I thought it would be.
