I'm sorry.

No, it's me,
it's my fault.

I wasn't looking.

These things...

So, are you
staying in the hotel?

No. I'm here
for a meeting.

So am i.

That's nice.

And I am
gonna be late.

This is the slowest elevator
in the world.

No, thank you.
I'll wait.

Suit yourself.

Thank you.

Stairs.

Ahem. Lost?

Uh, kind of, yeah.

I'm trying
to remember where

the grand ballroom is.

That's
where I'm going.

Mind if I tag along?

Suit yourself.

Thanks.

So what's
your meeting about?

If you don't mind
me asking?

I am booking
the grand ballroom

for a wedding.

Oh.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

Oh! Not for me.
Um, for my clients.

I'm a wedding planner.

Really? Ah!
It's small world.

I'm an event planner.

Oh?

Yeah, you know,
corporate retreats,

trade shows,
that kind of thing.

Sounds interesting.
It is.

That big Melman computers
party last month,

where we turned the entire
park square center

into a giant zombie walk?

That was me.

Wow.

Ms. summers!

Hello! Nice
to see you again.

Hi, Mr. Kwon.
Kenny!

Mr. Parker!

Good to see you.

Yeah! You too.

Uh, do you know each other?

Yeah, we--

No. And I don't want
to interrupt all this,

but I have the final check
for the 29th.

Right here.
Thank you.

Wait, wait, wait.
The 29th?

Like, next Saturday,
the 29th?

That's right.

That's when
I wanted to book it.

Oh, I'm sorry, but...

Wait. You're trying to book
a place for next week,<i> now?</i>

Yeah, one of my regular clients
called with a last-minute thing,

500 hundred car execs
need a place to party,

and this-- this
would be perfect.

I wish I could help you,

but I booked this room
six months ago.

Do you really need
this much space

for a wedding?

Kenny, why don't
you show her

one of the other
ballrooms?

Excuse me?

Well, the regent room

is smaller, but it's
certainly beautiful,

and the view...

And I will kick in

10% of the rental fee.

What?

15? What do you say?

I say that a deal
is a deal, Mr. Kwon,

no matter how many
people are in the party.

I'll see you
on Saturday.

Nice to meet you.

Happy wedding!

Do you believe in love?

<i>Of course you do.</i>

<i>That's why
you're getting married.</i>

<i>And that's why I'm here.</i>

<i>My name is Jessica summers,</i>

<i>and I'd like to help you plan
the most important day--</i>

Mom, I'm home!
<i>- ...Of your life.</i>

I'll be right there, honey!

The new website design
looks great.

We've had 100 hits since
we went online this morning.

Nice, mom. See what I
got from the library?

Original director's cut of
"Kansas City confidential."

Digitally restored.

You and your old movies.

They're not old, mom...

They're<i> classic.</i>

How was your day?

Good!

Except for this guy who tried
to weasel me out of a venue

that I booked six months
ago.

What happened?

Your mother prevailed.

And he, hopefully, went back
to event planning school.

How was your day?

Well...

We got our grades back

on that math test
from yesterday.

How'd you do?

You might want to sit down.

Mrs. dowd
is a pretty tough grader,

I'm sure you did your best.

96? You got 96%?

Would've been 97

if I hadn't left out
the decimal point

on the last question.

This is amazing!
Congratulations!

Thanks, mom.
I'm so proud of you!

Are you really?

What kind of question
is that?

Of course I am!

You're my hero.
You know that.

Yes, mom?

What is that?

What is what?

That.

Oh!

That!

I made it for you in class.

You did?

Sweetie, I love it,

but we don't have a dog.

Yeah.

About that, mom...

Luke.

Come on, mom.

I got 96% in math!

That's gotta be worth
at least a chihuahua.

Sweetie, we've
talked about this.

I know, but...

What do you have
against dogs anyway?

Nothing! I love dogs.

You know I love dogs.

But you have school
and basketball and homework,

and I've got a house
and a business and you.

We just don't have time
in our schedule for a dog.

Now go get cleaned up.
I made your favorite.

Mac-and-cheese casserole.

Good guess!

I don't have to guess, mom.
It's Tuesday night.

We always have
Mac-and-cheese casserole

on Tuesday night.

It's "on our schedule."

Jessica summers
wedding designs.

Jessica speaking.

Jessica!

Please come in.

You must be Gabby.

Guilty!

Oh, we have heard

the nicest things
about you,

and we just love
your website

and your blog.

Thank you.

My son, Paul,

when he heard the word
"wedding plan,"

he went a bit bonkers.

And he just doesn't want
to have a big fuss,

he likes to keep things
simple.

And--

...have some good food
and some music,

and call it a day.

Because it's not
just "a day", Paul.

It's our wedding day!

I didn't wait my whole life
just to get married

in someone's
backyard.

Not that it isn't
a beautiful...

No offense, Gabby.

No offense taken.

Paul and Lucy,

I would like you
to meet Jessica summers.

The wedding planner.

I can't believe
you're here.

I just hope I can help.

Paul, remember
we saw her on TV?

Isn't this the best?

Yeah. The best.

Nice to meet you.

Okay.

Let's get you married.

Yes!

This is one of my favorites.

We did a black-and-white
winter wedding

with a fairy-tale theme,

sort of heavy
on the "Princess" concept.

Princess?

Oh, Paul,
did you hear that?

Yeah. Princess.
It's great.

You know, with the budget
you have in mind,

we can create almost
anything,

but first, we need to determine
what you really want.

It's your day.

Okay... so...

I've always
wanted a pink wedding.

You know, with lots of
different shades of pink,

and pink flowers,

and maybe little white
lights everywhere--

And Paul, your tux could
have a pink cummerbund

and a matching
bow tie--

Whoa. I-i-- I'm not
wearing a pink bow tie.

But, Paul...

No.

You know, Paul...

I get it.

I do.

You asked the woman you love
a simple question,

"will you marry me?"

And then this whole
tidal wave hits you--

Family and friends
and invitations

and flowers and tulle.

And Lucy...

You've probably
been dreaming of this day

your whole life.

And you don't understand
why Paul isn't as excited

as you are
about all the details.

You're not alone, okay?

I've planned over 100 weddings
and in each one of them,

there's been some sort of
minor disagreement

between the bride and groom.

But I haven't lost one
couple.

Each and every one of them
made it to the altar.

And so will you.

Anybody home?

In here!

Is that Adam?
Yeah!

He's good
at this sort of stuff.

I thought maybe he can give us
a hand figuring out numbers--

You know, how much food to
buy, that kind of thing.

Paul, we already have
a wedding planner.

I know, I know.
I just thought

I'd like to
have him around

to make sure things
don't get too...

Pink.

There's
the blushing bride!

Uh, Jessica,

I would like you to meet
my nephew, Adam Parker.

Adam... Jessica.

The wedding planner.

Hello.

You two know each other?

We've met.

Yes. It's a small world.

Great!

Then you guys wouldn't
mind working together.

Right?

Oh, I--
I am so sorry.

I had no idea my son was
going to spring this on us.

Not a problem.

I'll sure Adam
will be very helpful.

Yes, I-I'm sure
he'll do his best, but...

He's not a wedding planner,
you know.

Is there anything

I can say to make you
reverse your decision

and help us with the
wedding?

I'm sorry,
I'm afraid not.

Well, if you ever
change your mind,

please let me know?

Of course.

Good luck with everything.

And if I could give you
a little advice?

Make sure Adam books the venue
more than a week in advance.

Okay, so, I'm sort of
thinking

we could put a big screen TV
on one end,

with huge speakers
on either side,

and roaming video cameras,
like a reality show.

Sweet!

Right?

Gonna be his-and-hers
dartboards...

Uh-huh...

You got your football helmet?
Yeah.

Did you see
that last hoop I sunk?

There wasn't even a sound,
it was like-- "swoosh."

It was amazing,
like you.

It wasn't just me, mom.
I've got a great team.

And I've got a great kid.

Thanks for coming.

Have I ever missed
a single one of your games?

No.

And I never will.
That's a promise.

How's the new
wedding going?

Oh, I'm not
doing that wedding.

Why?

Remember that guy
I told you about,

the one who tried

to steal the hotel
out from under me?

The weasel?

Turns out he's
the cousin of the groom.

So he can do
the wedding without me.

Jessica summers
wedding designs.

Jessica speaking.

<i>Hello, Jessica, dear!</i>

This is Gabby Taylor.

<i>Oh. Hi, Gabby.
How can I help you?</i>

Well...

To tell you the truth, this
is just a little bit awkward,

but I'm actually calling
for my nephew, Adam.

Okay...

This whole
wedding-planner thing

is a little bit out of
his comfort zone, so...

He was wondering if you could
meet him tomorrow for a coffee,

so that he could
pick your brain.

<i>Gabby, I, uh...</i>

I don't think I should
get involved in this.

I mean, you know, Paul wants
his cousin to do the wedding,

which I completely
understand, but--

Oh, but this isn't
about Paul.

I'm really concerned
about Lucy.

I just don't want her
to get lost in the shuffle.

<i>Her parents won't get here until
right before the wedding,</i>

<i>and I want to take care of her
just like her mother would.</i>

Um, well, I guess I could give
her one of my bridal books,

<i>if it would help?</i>

Um, honestly, what would
help

is if you could sit down
with Adam

and talk him
through the process.

I don't know...

I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

Adam came to me
on bended knee.

He was literally begging me
to have you help.

Just a little cup of coffee?

Gabby, can you hang on
just a minute, please?

Luke, it's business.
I know, mom!

Is this the wedding
you were talking about,

the one with the weasel?

Don't say "the weasel,"
his name is Adam.

Okay. So the groom
has Adam on his team, right?

In a way, I guess.

Well, what about
the bride?

Who's gonna be
on her team?

â™ª Dear future husband â™ª

â™ª Here's a few things
you'll need to know â™ª

â™ª If you want to be my one
and only all my life... â™ª

I am so sorry.

There was a huge line
at the passport office,

and there was babies crying
and some guy passed out.

It was a mess.

Well, but you're
here now, so.

And I need some of this.

Hi.

I'd like a large two-pump,
sugar-free vanilla-soy,

no foam, fair trade,
dark roast latte.

I'll have a small coffee.
Black.

Wow. Taking a walk
on the wild side, huh?

So the passport
office, huh?

Where're you going?

I'm not
exactly sure yet.

What do you mean?

Well, every year
on my birthday,

I throw a dart
at this map on the wall,

and wherever
that dart lands,

the next day,
I got to go there.

Seriously?
Uh-huh.

You mean, you don't plan it
or anything,

you just go
wherever the dart goes?

Sure. Why not?

Because
it's weird and random.

Exactly.

That's why I gotta keep
the old passport up-to-date.

Last year was Bhutan.

Incredible.
What about you?

Do you like to travel?

I'd like to,
but with Luke in school,

that's my son,
he's in sixth grade,

and my business,

there's just
not enough time.

That is what I love
about event planning.

You get the job,
you set it up,

do the event,
and boom--

Out the door,
and you're done.

I frees me up
to do whatever I want,

go wherever I want.

I am not gonna be
one of those people

who end up 80 years old

with nothing to show
for their life.

You know?

I don't really think of
my son as "nothing."

What? No!
Oh, my god, no.

I'm so--
Okay, wow.

That is not
what I meant.

I'm really doing
well today, huh?

It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

So, no wife, no girlfriend?

Nah, never really had
time for that.

But you had time for Bhutan?

What about you?

You married?

I was.

That was a long time ago.

And now I have
my business and my son.

So, no boyfriend?

Don't really have time
for that either.

So, what kinds of things did
you want to ask me about?

What?

You wanted to meet for
coffee,

to talk about
Paul and Lucy's wedding.

Where should we start?

I wanted to meet you?

Didn't you?

No. Aunt Gabby called me and
said you wanted to meet me,

and get some tips on expanding
your business model

...or something.
My business model?

Yeah, like learn more
about event planning and...

We've been set up.

Your aunt must be desperate
to get us to work together

on this wedding.

Paul and Lucy
are a great couple.

They deserve a great
wedding.

You think you can do it?

Well, Paul wants me to...

But I don't have
the experience that you do.

To be honest,

I could really use your
help.

If we<i> were</i> to work
together--

Okay.

"If."

We would have to present
a united front

to the bride and groom.

Absolutely.

You make all the decisions.
I'll be a silent partner.

I'll just go along
with anything you say.

What do you think?

Should we give it a shot?

Jessica! Adam.

What a lovely surprise!

Seriously, aunt Gabby?

Which one of us
did you call first?

Well, let's not
dwell on the past.

Come on in!

Chicken wings?

Yeah, but they're gonna be
in a nice silver dish.

Kids!

I have a surprise
for you.

Your new wedding planners.

June is just around the
your new wcorner, planners.

So we already have
a pretty short lead time,

but if we're organized,

we should be able to
get you everything you want.

Agreed!

Thank you.

So, let's start
with the big picture first.

The size of the event.

Big or small?

Small.

Uh,<i> big.</i>

Okay, let's put a pin
in that one

and move on to something
else.

What degree of formality
would you like?

Not?

Well... let's be
more specific.

There's ultra-formal, formal,
semi-formal, and informal.

I would like it to be
formal.

Yeah, but not too formal.

What if we compromised?

I mean, I'm just riffing
here,

but what about a big barbecue,
and Jessica dresses it up?

I know this place
where we can get

and I'm thinking maybe
black-tie for the waiters?

I kind of like
that idea!

Darling,
this is a wedding...

Not a monster
truck rally.

Next idea?

I was thinking maybe
a modern, vintage style.

Hawaiian barbecue!

Tiki torches!

Okay, let's put a pin
in that one, too,

and move on to the ceremony.

I was hoping
we could do it

where you and dad
got married?

Forget it.

They turned it
into condos.

Besides,
it was cursed.

Why do you have to have
two places?

What do you mean?

Why can't you have
the wedding

and the reception
at the same venue?

Much more cost-effective,

and that way, your guests don't
have to try to find parking

twice in the same day.

What do you guys think?

Yeah.

Okay, sold.

Yes! One point for me.

We're not keeping score,
Adam.

It's a wedding,
not a competition.

So who's going to officiate?

I got it.

I know exactly where
we're gonna do this!

Where?

Northwood
athletic center.

Whoa...

"The northwood
athletic center?"

Paul, I don't know
what that is.

It's where the football team
holds its spring training.

It would be amazing.

The center is right by a
lake, we could set up tents.

I did this event there
last year.

We could call the guy
up and I know we--

You're suggesting

we have Paul and Lucy's wedding
at a football stadium?

Lots of parking?

Would you all excuse me
for a minute, please?

Adam, may I please
speak with you outside?

What happened
to our "united front"?

I thought you were
gonna follow my lead.

I'm sorry. I got
a little carried away.

A little?

We're supposed to be
planning a wedding,

not the super bowl.

I know, but I thought
we were losing Paul,

and I wanted
to throw him a bone.

Besides, the athletic center
is kind of incredible.

My clients loved it.

What clients?

They have the largest
fishing competition

in the entire
pacific northwest.

Look.

Adam, I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

I really do!

But here's the thing.

I believe that every wedding

is an opportunity to bring
two people together.

It's not always easy,
but I think it's worth it.

And I think we need to use
my experience

to guide
Paul and Lucy together.

Everything all right
out here?

It's great.

Everything's fine.
Good.

About
the football stadium...

I--<i> we...</i>

don't think
it's gonna work.

Oh?

Yeah, it's just not really

the right venue
for this kind of even--

Wedding.

But don't worry.

We have some other
wonderful ideas.

And we are going to go
and find the perfect place

for Paul and Lucy
to tie the old knot.

We'd better get going.

We've got
a wedding to plan.

Okay, I think you're
going to like this one.

It's got everything we need
for a perfect wedding.

It's great, isn't it?

Lots of room for curtains
and lights.

Easy access to parking
over here,

so the trucks
can load and unload.

Oh, and check this out
over here--

This is the best part.

Look at how close it is
to the bathrooms.

So what do you think?

Is that a no?

You have to start
thinking about

what would make
for a perfect wedding venue.

I thought I had.

So, what do you think?

I think Paul would run
screaming from this place.

Oh, come on!

How could anybody
not love it?

It's got charm,
it's got history,

but most importantly,

it's got "romance"
written all over it.

Where?

Tsk!

Do you know how many
weddings they've had here?

That kind of thing

has real symbolic
weight for people.

Maybe if people
put as much time

and thought into their marriages
as they did their weddings,

there wouldn't be
so many divorces.

There's nothing
I can do about that.

But what I can do

is give them one
perfect, memorable day,

and get them started out
right.

And for that,

I need
a romantic setting.

Oh, you want
a romantic setting?

Come with me.

Can I
ask you a question?

Shoot.

Have you got something
against weddings?

Why?

I don't know,
just a feeling I get.

Nothing against them,
per se, but...

I mean, why do you need
a contract for love?

If you want to be
with someone,

then you be with them,
and when you don't,

you can both
just walk away.

Out the door.
Done.

It's just more practical.

Okay, but forget
about the legal stuff.

There's something
very powerful

about two people

standing in front
of their community,

declaring their love
for each other.

I just think

it's a really beautiful,
important thing

in a couple's life.

Okay.

Well, if you don't
mind me asking--

What happened
to my marriage?

Too personal?
I'm sorry.

No, it's okay.

We're still
friends, but...

Let's just say
the man I married

wasn't the husband
or father

I thought he'd be.

But you're
a wedding planner.

I mean,
it's kind of ironic.

Not really.

Just because I made
one bad decision

doesn't mean I can't
still believe in love.

And I definitely still
believe in marriage.

So why haven't
you remarried?

Because. Right now,

I'm raising the most
important person

in the world to me.

And between Luke
and my business, well...

That's all I need.

See, I don't think
that's completely true.

I think you could use

some more adventure
in your life.

Well, if I don't have
a wedding booked,

Luke and I go out for pizza
and a movie

the first Saturday
of every month.

That's all
the adventure I need.

That's
not adventure.

This... is adventure.

Wow.

This is beautiful.

Isn't it?

Paul would love it.

I bet Lucy would, too.

Here, turn around.

Oh!

Nice.

Wait...

You mean
for the wedding?

Yeah!

We could set up tables
over here,

run some lights.

Build a platform

for the minister
to do the ceremony.

How are people
supposed to get here?

Like we did. Hike.

An entire wedding party?

In tuxedos.

And a bride
in a wedding dress?

She could lift it up
when she walks.

You know, I really
thought we were

communicating here.

You don't like it?

No! I love it.
I love it!

It's incredible,
but not for a wedding.

Huh! I didn't realize you'd
be so closed to new ideas.

Not "new." Bad.

That's just in your opinion.

Well, in this case,
it's my opinion that counts.

You know, you clearly don't get
the entire concept of romance.

What makes you the expert?

The only man in your life
is your 10-year-old kid.

Just because I don't have
time for a relationship

doesn't mean I don't
understand romance.

Don't have time,
or just gave up?

I'm not taking
relationship advice

from a guy who can't even
commit to a vacation spot

without throwing
a dart at a map!

You're making this
a lot more difficult

than it has to be.

Because it's important!

And if you don't
understand that now,

you probably never will.
Let's go.

Where?

Sleeping beauty's castle?

Rockefeller center?

The white house?

No! I'm going home!

You've obviously
got this covered,

so, from here on in,
you're on your own.

I drove!

Argh!

So how goes the planning
with you and Jessica?

Well.

We've hit a few bumps,
but...

don't worry.
It's gonna be great.

This whole thing's
getting out of control.

Lucy wants this,
my mom wants that,

I want something else.

You getting cold feet?

Nah, it's nothing like that.
It's...

It's just a lot to take in,
that's all.

Yeah.

So why do it?

Huh?

Why get married?

Because there's no one
I'd rather be with.

No one I'd rather talk to,
come home to.

Yeah, but why the whole
wedding dog-and-pony show?

What's the big deal
about getting up there

in front of a bunch of people
and saying some words?

Because I'm going to be
saying those words to Lucy.

Because I love her.

And I want
the whole world to know.

<i>You're sorry?</i>

I love this part.
Watch this.

Thanks!

For nothing.

Mom?

Mom!

Yeah, honey,
it's almost ready.

Uh... okay.

Let me ask you a question.

Do you think we have enough
adventure in our lives?

Adventure?

Yeah, you know,
fun stuff, crazy--

Out of the ordinary
that kind of thing.

We go to the movies
and have pizza.

Yeah, but is that
really "adventure"?

Mom, I have school,
homework,

and the basketball
regional finals

coming up next month.

You have your own business.

Adventure isn't really
on our schedule.

Don't worry about it.

I've got practice today,
but I won't be late.

I'll come pick you up.

What about the wedding
with the weasel?

I mean, "Adam."

That turned out to be
a little more work

than I bargained for.

I've left it all
up to him.

Wow.

You've... you've never
quit a wedding before.

The guy must've
really got to you.

He did not "get" to me.

I just prefer
to work alone is all.

Where's my phone?

Didn't get to you.

Right.

Thanks.

Ahem. Jessica summers
wedding designs.

Jessica speaking.

Hey, it's Adam.

Oh. Hello, Adam.

What can I do for you?

I wanted to apologize to you,
but I need to do it in person.

That's all right,
don't worry about it.

Please?

Okay, fine.

Um, where are you?

I am right outside
your front door.

Hi.

Hey.

You must be Luke.

You must be the...

Adam.

You play basketball?

No. I just
carry it around,

for show.

You play?

Two-time state champion
in college.

College
was a long time ago.

Smart guy.

Luke, honey,
you're going to be late.

See you later.
Mom!

These are for you.

I'm sorry.

Adam, you didn't have to--

There are 15 of them.

Apology roses?

How did you know that?

I looked it up on the
Internet.

They're beautiful.

Thank you.

Come on in.

See, that's
the thing about me.

I know when
I know something,

and I know
when I don't.

Well, that's important.

And that's why I'm here.

I want
to make this work,

for Paul and Lucy,

for aunt Gabby...

For me.

I want to learn,

but I only learn
from the best.

And that's you.

We start with a vision
board.

Isn't that
a native American thing?

That's a "vision quest."

All right.
As we make decisions,

and Lucy and Paul
make choices,

we'll post them on this
board-- everything from

the wedding's color palette
to the invitations.

I do all
my invites online.

It's fast
and efficient,

and saves trees.

It's also
completely temporary.

You can't put an email
in a scrapbook.

Here.

Feel this.

It's nice...

Mm.

Expensive.

Well, it's
more than that.

It's a part of
the experience I love.

And they make

for a lovely souvenir
that you can keep forever.

Don't you think that's, like,
a little old-fashioned?

Not entirely.
Guests can rsvp online.

And you should
actually start

helping Paul and Lucy

work on their
wedding website.

What is that for?

That...

Is to keep
guests updated

and give friends
and family

a place where
they can share thoughts

and memories
of the happy couple.

You know, I never
thought of that either.

Huh! Now who's
being old-fashioned?

So working backwards
from the wedding date,

everything has to
be calendared.

Wait.
That's a verb?

The most important one

in the wedding business--
It's how we know

when to book the vendors--
The caterers, florists,

photographers,
videographers.

I have some of the best
vendors in town.

Have they ever done a
wedding?

I don't know,

but they satisfied
a fortune 500 company,

so, pretty sure they can
handle a bride and groom.

Mm. I wouldn't count on it.

It's better to stick with
experienced professionals,

people you know.

No room for adventure
in a wedding, huh?

You'd be surprised.

Um, you always have to
prepare for the unexpected.

So the next thing we need
to consider is the cake.

I have
a fantastic cake guy.

He made an exact replica
of the 1968 Ford mustang

that Steve McQueen
drove in<i> bullitt.</i>

Fed 300 people.

That sounds just
perfect for a wedding.

Ahem.

Jessica summers wedding designs.
Jessica speaking.

<i>Jessica, dear!
It's Gabby.</i>

How are things going?

Oh, yeah,
things are going--

...Fine.

Um, everything's
totally under control.

Good.

I was just wondering
where we are

with choosing a venue.

I think it would go a long
way

towards reassuring Lucy
and my son.

We're on our way.

All right!

Come on.

Where are we going?

It's showtime.

It's over 200 years old,

and it's been the site
of hundreds of weddings,

including those of
crowned heads of state,

movie stars,
world leaders.

So? What do you think?

It is so adorable.

It's beautiful.
It looks old.

Well, that's kind of the
idea.

It's historic, honey.

Why do we have to
get married in a museum?

Why can't we get married
someplace cool?

How'd you feel
about a waterfall?

You know what
we should do?

We should put a pin
in this one as well,

and move on to something
that we can all agree on--

The cake.

Okay, Amy's put together a
lot of classic combinations

for you
to choose from.

Amy, take it away.

We've got
a banana cake

with chocolate
butter cream.

We've got coconut
with lime butter cream,

there's a lemon mousse
chiffon,

hazelnut meringue
black forest,

with cherry
jubilee filling.

Honey, try this one.

That's
a champagne cake.

Mm. It's interesting.

Do you want to join us?
There's cake.

Well--
Ah! He made it!

Sorry I'm late.

Had a little trouble
with my ganache.

Everybody, this is Burt.

He's an old friend of mine,

and one of the best bakers
in the northwest.

It's good.

Uh, present company
excluded.

Nice to meet you, Burt.

What a lovely...
Surprise.

I've asked Burt
to bring us

something
a little outside the box.

We got chocolate cake
and chocolate ganache,

and a cream cheese
frosting.

And Dulce De leche
with a peanut butter cream.

What are you doing?

Eating. I'm eating.

No. What is Burt
doing here?

I wanted to bring
some adventure

to this wedding.

I thought
we talked about this.

We did,
but you didn't say no.

I also didn't say
you could hijack the cake.

You're hurting
Amy's feelings.

Mm! These are good!

I think I like
the champagne cake better.

Well, they're
all delicious,

but I thought Amy was
making the wedding cake.

It's okay, it's no problem.
I--

I just want
everybody to be happy.

Amy...

Is going to make
the wedding cake.

And Burt is going to
make the groom's cake.

Groom's cake?
No way!

Yeah. Paul, you let Lucy
pick the wedding cake,

and then you have any kind
of groom's cake you want.

And he can pick whatever
style he wants, right, Burt?

Yeah, sure!
I can do one

shaped like
a football stadium.

Yeah!

This is gonna be
the best wedding ever!

I'm Burt.

Nice save. Thanks.

If we're gonna be a team,

we have to watch
each other's backs.

That means
no more surprises.

Agreed?

Agreed.

Mm!

They all look so...
Formal.

They're supposed

to look formal.

They're tuxedos!

They're all supposed
to look like that.

Why can't we wear
something more casual, mom?

Something that's more like
me.

Honey, come on.

It's just
for one day.

Please?

For me?

How's it going?

About as well
as can be expected.

I think if your cousin
had his way,

he'd get married
in sweat pants

and a baseball cap.

I got this one.

Ladies.
Excuse us, please.

Paul... step
into my office.

Well, what do you think?

If anyone can convince
my son to do anything,

it's Adam.

Jessica?

May I ask a favor?

Of course.

My mom would love
to be here to help,

but she and my dad
won't be back from Europe

until a week before the
wedding.

I know this isn't something
wedding planners usually do,

but would you come look
at wedding dresses with me?

Gabby and I picked out
three.

I'd really like your opinion
before I choose.

Of course!
I'd be honored.

Thanks.

It would mean a lot to me.

Consider it done.

Ladies...

May I present to you...

The groom?

Wow.

Oh, my gosh...

I can't believe my little
boy is getting married.

He looks
so handsome.

Paul, you look...

I look pretty good.

I'm impressed.

How did you get him
to do that?

It was simple.

I just told him

what every guy
who puts on a tux

wants to hear.

What's that?

"You look like James Bond."

I feel like I've been
let into a secret society.

I'm so glad
Lucy let you come.

I wanted you to get
the full wedding experience.

Wow.

It's a classic silhouette.

Timeless.

It says "I don't care
about trends

"or being cutting edge.

I will never
go out of style."

So in 30 years,

when you're looking
at your wedding albums,

you're not going,
"what was I thinking?"

Exactly.

Okay, let's see
the next one.

Very dramatic.

This is a statement dress.

And what exactly
is it saying?

"I'm confident,

"assertive,

and glamorous."

Let's see the next one.

What?

No good?

You look so beautiful.

Really?

Like a Princess.

No, not a Princess.

More like

the most beautiful you

you could ever be.

Really?

Really.

This is the one.

Hey, buddy.

I'll take you out
in a minute.

Mom!

Kate's here!

Fear in the night, seen it.

Kansas City confidential,
seen it.

Detour, seen it.

D.O.A.? Yes!

Your mom have
another wedding?

Nope, my mom
has a date.

I do not have a date.

It's work.

I'm just going to
sample some food

for the Taylor wedding.

Hi, Kate.

Hi, Ms. summers.

So, how do I look?

Like you're
going on a date.

I got it.

Luke. Behave.

Come on, mom, trust me.

I won't be late.

I always figured
you'd come back.

Good figuring.
You here for the lady?

I ain't here
for the mashed potatoes.

Okay, that's enough.

Bed by 9:00, and no soda.

Wow.

Treat her right, or you'll
be hearing from me.

Be good for Katie.

If I do,

can we talk about
getting a dog?

Good night.

A dog?

Yeah, he really
wants a dog.

You look great.

Thank you.

You do too.

Thank you.

Uh, we'd better
hurry up.

I promised sal
we'd be there at 7:00.

Stay out as late as you
want!

Yes!

Enjoy.

Jessica...

How lovely
you look tonight.

Thank you, sal.
This is Adam.

You're a very
lucky man, Adam.

No. No, I'm not--

No, no, no, we're just
business partners, sal.

Whatever you say.

Come in the kitchen.

I've prepared a few
special things for you.

Sal, you didn't have
to do all this.

My pleasure.

You make yourself
comfortable,

and we are
going to present you

with some of
our very finest items,

made just for you.

Thank you.

Man, it smells
amazing.

We begin with mini-bruschetta
and crostini

with 12 different
toppings.

Wow.

Mm.

Try the smoked salmon
with asparagus.

Try the crab with chili.

Mm...

And a little digestive aid

on the house.

Thank you.

You know what would
be amazing after this?

Some kind of hand-made pasta

with a drizzle of olive oil,
and capers.

And maybe we could have
a wood-burning pizza oven

with made-to-order pizzas?

And we could use
locally sourced ingredients,

like gorgonzola--

And pear?

Yes, perfect!

It's strange having
dinner conversation

that doesn't
involve basketball

or wanting a dog.

I'll bet.

It's nice.

Can I ask you a question?

Okay.

Why did you become
a wedding planner?

Oh, um...

I liked the idea
of owning my own business.

No, no, that's not what I
mean.

I mean, we all do what we do
for different reasons,

but there's always
that first step.

What was yours?

It's silly.

Silly's okay.

When I was a little girl,

my parents had
their wedding picture

framed on the piano.

They looked so beautiful,

the colors, the dresses,
and the flowers.

I used to stare at that
picture

and wish
I was in it.

So I started planning
weddings.

And after all my stuffed animals
had married each other,

and the dolls
had married each other,

and the neighbor's dog
married our cat...

...it became pretty
clear to everyone

that I was going to
do something

in the matrimonial field.

See?

I told you there had to be
a first step somewhere.

My parents have been married
for 46 years.

Wow.

That is inspiring.

I just love the idea

that something
could last that long.

A wedding is sort of like
a seed you plant.

Sometimes, it grows,

and sometimes, it doesn't.

But I never stopped
believing that it could.

Except for yourself.

Penne alla vodka
alla sal.

Maybe
I wasn't clear

about this not
being a full meal?

Wow.

Mm!

Mm.

So good.

I propose a toast.

To Paul and Lucy.

Yes.

May the seed that we help plant
grow as tall as their love.

Hmm.

Too schmaltzy?

A little.

Thank you.

I'm never eating again.

Well, at least we can
agree on the caterer.

We agree
on a lot of things.

We're gonna get there,
don't worry about it.

Well, we still
don't have a venue,

and the wedding
is only a month away.

How did they meet,

your cousin and Lucy?

It was not
very romantic,

But...
They were both golfing,

and Lucy forgot to yell
"fore."

He took a ball right to
the back of the head,

knocked him flat
to the ground.

Well...

Well, um...

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Thank you.

Wait!

What?
What's the matter?

I got it.

I know where we can have the
wedding and the reception,

and everybody
is going to love it.

Really?

I was playing right over
there.

I hit the ball...

Whack!

Right in the head.

I thought I'd killed him.

I ran over,
and I was crying and...

And I'm laying on my back, on
the grass, I'm kinda dizzy,

and I look up at her...

And he just
started laughing,

and that made me
start laughing.

And right away,

I knew this was the girl
I wanted to marry.

It was love
at first hit.

So...

What's the verdict?

Yes.

All right.

Great.

All right, we'll do
a welcome cocktail party

over here,

and then...

Over here is where
we'll have the ceremony.

I'm thinking

we can frame it
with roses--

And little
twinkle lights

that's perfect.

Now, in here

is where we'll have
the reception.

Oh, this is
so exciting.

Twinkle lights?

What's happening
to you, man?

Maybe she's rubbing off
on me a little.

You sure that's all?

Will there be
centerpieces?

Everyone loves to
take home the centerpiece.

Absolutely.

We're doing
fire and ice roses.

And we'll set
some lights up

along there,

and speakers
over here in the back,

and we'll put
the dj over there.

Oh, that
reminds me,

have you two picked out
your song yet?

Song?

For your first dance.

Dance?

Oh...

Uh-oh.

I always knew
my ballroom dancing lessons

would come in handy one day.

Let's hear the music.
Come on, everyone.

I brought our song.

I can't wait
to hear it.

W-wait, how is that our
song?

Don't you
remember, Paul?

After you got hit in the
head with the golf ball,

on our way to the hospital,

it was playing
on the ambulance radio.

That's not our song, honey.

This is our song.

Remember?

The night we won
the bowling championships,

they played it
over the P.A.

Let's put
a pin in that.

I've got something
that might work.

That's lovely.

Let's dance.

Okay, now...

â™ª Forget the world now
we won't let them see â™ª

â™ª But there's one thing
left to do â™ª

Ow!

See, I told you
he can't dance.

At his senior prom,
he broke his date's toe.

Well, we can't have
that happening

at their wedding.

Maybe they should just
forget about it.

No.

It's okay.

No, the first dance
is one of the best parts

of the whole wedding.

So let's show 'em.

Uh...

Uh, no,

I don't usually participate.

"Usually" is the enemy
of adventure.

Come on.

â™ª Together can never be
close enough for me â™ª

â™ª To feel like I am
close enough to you â™ª

â™ª You wear white â™ª

â™ª And I'll wear out
the words "I love you" â™ª

â™ª And you're beautiful â™ª

â™ª Now that the wait is over â™ª

â™ª And love has
finally shown her... â™ª

Have you two
danced together before?

No. Never.

Hmm, well,
maybe you should.

â™ª Marry me â™ª

â™ª If I ever get
the nerve to say "hello" â™ª

â™ª In this cafe... â™ª

I thought you said
you played.

I'm taking it easy on you
'cause you're old.

Well, what are you gonna
do at regionals?

Come on.

Something like...

This!

Oh--

Oh!

Yes!

Nice shot. Nice shot.

All right.

All right,
that's enough!

Homework.

I already did it.

I wasn't talking to you.

Sorry, pally,
ya heard the lady.

At least we'll always have
the driveway.

Okay, I think we're in
pretty good shape.

The only thing
we have to do now

is the seating arrangements.

Wait, wait.

You keep telling me that
this is all about two people

blending their lives
together, right?

So, why can't people just
sit wherever they want?

Because it helps things
run more smoothly.

Weddings are stressful
enough without adding chaos.

Okay, that is what
I don't understand.

Why does a wedding have to
be stressful at all?

Um, when was the last time
you were at a wedding?

Um...
I don't remember.

Okay, I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.

Why, where are we going?

I have
the Henderson wedding.

You're coming with me.

Hi!

Is your dad home?

Come on in!

It's open!

I'm here whenever you're
ready!

I'm coming.

Make yourself
at home.

How do I look?

Presentable.

Ah, that's what
I was going for.

I see you've met Howard.

He's been
the perfect host.

We bumped into each other
at a shelter,

and we've been
best buddies ever since.

Yeah, it's not
as good as yours, but...

Again, very presentable.

So, dart day
on the 27th?

Does that mean
that your birthday

is the same day as
Paul and Lindsay's wedding?

Yeah.

That's
pretty cool, huh?

Yeah.

Yeah, so, is that the day
you're going to pick the spot

for your next trip yet?

That's the day.

Thank you.

Well, let's go
to a wedding, hmm?

First, the m.O.B.
Comes down the aisle.

The-the what?

"Mother of the bride."

Just watch what happens.

Okay.

Madison, no!

No, no, no, no!

You're the flower girl!

Oh, you've ruined
your dress!

Don't worry, I brought
an extra dress for her

in the car.

Thank you, Jessica.
You're a lifesaver.

Just get her cleaned up
and I'll be right back.

Wow, you are good.

Just suck in--

I'm sucking in.

I told you
to get the other dress.

Mom, please,
not right now--

Just suck in, suck in.

How's my bride?

Mom!

Don't panic,
I'll take care of this.

Everybody go outside
and get some fresh air, huh?

After you.

Adam...

We'll get this fixed
in just a minute.

Okay?

Okay...

It's a nice dress.

Just-just breathe,
breathe.

Slower, slower...

The ring?

And so,

by the power
vested in me

by our great state,

I now pronounce you

husband and wife.

I see what you mean
about stress.

Shh!

This is the best part.

You may kiss your bride.

I've gotta admit,

that was beautiful.

We still have an hour
before Luke's game.

Plenty of time
to get there.

You seriously have never
missed a single game?

Not one.

I'm impressed, Jess.

You've really got it
all figured out.

I don't know about that.

Come on, Jess,

you're this amazing
wedding planner,

you've got this great kid.

You almost have
the perfect life.

Almost?

I mean, you're this beautiful,
smart, successful woman.

You deserve more.

Like?

Do I have to
spell it out?

You bring so much
romance to others,

don't you think it's time
you had some for yourself?

That's just not
in the plan right now.

Is that the real reason?

Or is it maybe because
you're a little bit scared?

Please.

I'm not the one
throwing darts at a map.

That is not
the same thing.

Really?

You travel
all around the world,

but never go to
the same place twice.

It's like you're
event planning.

You drop in,
the event happens,

boom, out the door
and done.

What does that
have to do with anything?

I just wonder what
you're running from.

Oh, boy.

Where's your spare?

In the garage,

where I put it,

because I needed the storage
space in the trunk.

I'm calling the auto club.

I am not missing Luke's
game.

Oh, no, I don't have a
signal.

The game starts
in an hour.

I got nothing.

There's a building over
there, a house or something.

Maybe they have
a land line I can use.

Stay with the car,
I'll be right back.

Are you kidding?

Every horror movie
ever made

starts like that.

I'm coming with you.

Hello?

Anybody here?

Still not
getting a signal.

You?

Uh...

Um...

Nope, nothing.

If I miss his game...

And what happens

if you miss his game?

Well, i...

He, uh...

Well, I just always
want to make sure

that I make time
for him.

But you can't
make time for you?

No, i...

I mean, yes, i...

I guess I could.

I'm just...

Afraid of what might happen
if I do.

Well, if we're being honest
here in the greenhouse,

what you said before is
true.

I am running,

probably for the exact
same reasons you are.

I'm afraid
I might get hurt, too.

We're supposed to be
such good planners,

you and me.

How come we didn't plan
for this?

Can I help you folks?

Uh...

Yes. Uh, do you have
a phone we could use?

No, I missed it.

I missed the game!

Luke!

Hey, mom!

I am so sorry, honey.

Mom, we won!

We won regionals!

We're going to the finals!

Congratulations, sweetie.

Nice work, pally.

Thanks, fella.

I am so sorry
we're late, honey.

Mom, that's okay.

No, it's not okay.
I feel terrible.

I was just worried

you were in an accident
or something.

Hey, you won.

Right?

That's the most
important thing.

Right?

Okay, I want you to tell me
all about the game.

Okay?

Good boy.

Mom, come on,

we gotta get a dog!

We'll talk about it
later, sweetie.

Come on, Howard.

Get the ball,
get the ball, yeah!

Good boy.

Do you want the ball?
Do you want it?

He is such
a great kid.

Get it. Get it, yeah.

I can't do this.

Can't... or won't?

I can't.

So you missed
one basketball game.

So you're human.

It's not just the game.

It's... everything.

You're throwing darts,

and I'm raising a child.

I just have to focus on my son
and my business right now,

and that's it.

Now who's running away?

That's not fair.

It isn't.

Not to either of us.

We'll finish
the wedding together,

and then,

that's it.

I hope you'll understand.

I'm going to have to.

I'm sorry.

Luke, let's go!

Bye, Howard!

See you later, Luke!

Not if I see you first.

Good, good.

Candelabra
on the head table.

Oh, can you add some flowers
to this centerpiece?

It's a little lopsided.

Whoa!

I've got you.

Thanks.

We've come this far.

Don't want to lose
the wedding planner

in the home stretch.

Can you check on
the arbor lights?

I think
they're flickering.

On it.

Well, tomorrow
is the big day.

Everything is looking
so beautiful, Jessica,

and I really do appreciate

you and Adam
working together like this.

I think it's going to be
a really lovely wedding.

Yes!

And you two
make a wonderful team.

Maybe even... more?

Excuse me.

Okay,

time for bed.

Aw, but, mom,

that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.

Come here.

You know that I am never
going to miss

another game of yours
again, right?

You missed one game

in what, three years?

It's okay.

You're allowed
to have a life, mom.

I'll be right up.

You think it'd be okay
if I went over to Adam's

to play with
the dog sometime?

Well, honey, you know,
after tomorrow,

we're probably not going
to see very much of Adam.

How come?

Well, because we were just
working together on the wedding,

and once it's over,
well, that's that.

You know I'll always need
you

and you'll always be
my mom, right?

Right.

But I don't need you
all the time

like when I did
when I was little.

What are you trying to say?

It's just...

If you ever decided
you wanted to have,

you know, a boyfriend?

I'd be cool with that.

Especially if
he was someone like Adam.

Well. Thank you.

But Adam
has his own life,

and so do we.

I love you.

Jessica summers
wedding designs.

Jessica speaking.

<i>Jess, it's me.</i>

Hi. What's up?

We got a problem.

Get dressed, honey.

We're going to Katie's.

Why?

Wedding emergency.

Oh, no, it just doesn't
stop.

They don't know exactly
how it happened,

but the sprinkler
system cracked,

and they're concerned

that the whole thing
might collapse.

They're shutting us down.

It's ruined.

Everything is ruined.

Look at this.

Poor Lucy and Paul.

We're going to have to
cancel everything.

Are we?

No.

Call our vendors.

There's been a change of
plans.

Amy's cake shop.

What's up?

Mm-hmm.

Yes?

Yes.

All of this
from a flat tire.

I take you, Lucy,

to be my wife,
my partner,

and my best friend.

I still can't believe

I'm the one
who gets to marry you

and walk beside you

wherever life's journey
leads us.

I take you, Paul,
to be my husband,

my partner,
and my best friend.

I promise
to walk beside you

wherever life's journey
leads us.

And to never mention
pink bow ties again.

By the authority
vested in me,

I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

Congratulations,

you may kiss your bride.

Looks like he finally
got the hang of it.

Yeah, it's funny
what you can learn

when you put
your whole heart into it.

So... do you know yet
where you're going

on your big trip tomorrow?

No, I haven't
thrown my dart.

Wow.

Jessica,

I just want to thank you
for all of this.

None of this would have
happened without you.

Or you.

We made a good team.

I, um...

I should go.

I told Luke
that I wouldn't be late,

and, uh, I'll meet the crew here
in the morning for clean-up.

So--

Jess...

Goodbye, Adam.

Happy birthday.

â™ª Together can never be
close enough for me â™ª

â™ª To feel like
I am close enough to you â™ª

â™ª You wear white â™ª

â™ª And I'll wear out
the words "I love you..." â™ª

Why did you
let her go?

Are you crazy?

You two are a perfect match.

I guess you can't plan for
these things, aunt Gabby.

Come on,

let's dance.

Come on.

â™ª ...today and every day â™ª

â™ª Marry me... â™ª

Yes, Mrs. gelson, I got it.

Purple roses

to go with the bridesmaids'
purple dresses.

Yeah, no, absolutely.

Okay.

Okay, thank you.

Bye-bye.

Mom, we gotta leave
in, like, half an hour.

Okay, honey!

Are we going for a pizza
after the game?

Yeah, sure, we always...

How about thai food?

Um, I love thai food,

but we usually have pizza
on Saturdays.

"Usually" is the enemy
of adventure.

And I think it's time

we brought a little more
adventure into our lives.

Wow, mom.

Take a walk
on the wild side.

Jessica summers
wedding designs.

Jessica speaking.

<i>Yeah, hi,</i>

<i>I'd like to see about
booking you for a wedding?</i>

Hmm. Okay,
what's the date?

<i>I don't know yet.</i>

All right, well,
we need to know that

before we can start
making arrangements.

<i>Well, the thing is,</i>

<i>I haven't asked
the bride-to-be yet.</i>

I see.

And what's stopping you
from asking her?

<i>I'm a little nervous</i>

since she's kind of
out of my league,

and it's a really
long story,

but I'm really hoping

that it has a happy ending.

Mom, look,
Howard's here.

Here. Here, boy,

I got something for you.

Come here.

Howard...

Hi.

Hi.

You know, i...

I don't know
anything about adventure.

I do.

But i...

I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

I'm tired of planning things
that only last a day.

Boom,

out the door and done.

Yeah?

I want to start planning
things that last a lifetime.

With you.

Look, guys, he loves it!

What happened to
your birthday trip?

Funny thing about that is...

I threw my dart,

and it landed here,

with you.

â™ª Love has surely
shifted my way â™ª

â™ª Marry me â™ª

â™ª Today and every day... â™ª
