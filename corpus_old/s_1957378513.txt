[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

[static hisses]

All right, we're all set.

Okay, now remember we both take
three paces, turn, and draw.

Now don't look at the camera
or you'll ruin the movie.

Dude, you look at the
camera all the time.

No, I don't.

Okay, ready, pace.


Boom, boom!
Bang!

I got you, I got you!
I got you first!

[Young Logan groans]

[siren wailing]

Okay.

stop, that tickles.

Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

Bang.

[Young Logan groans]
[Young Blake laughs]

Okay, you're dead.

Cut!

[ominous music]

â™ª I'm only human â™ª

â™ª I'm only, I'm only â™ª

â™ª I'm only human â™ª

â™ª I'm only, I'm only â™ª

â™ª Maybe I'm foolish â™ª

â™ª Maybe I'm blind â™ª

â™ª Thinking I can
see through this â™ª

â™ª And see what's behind â™ª

â™ª Got no way to prove it â™ª

â™ª So maybe I'm blind â™ª

Exactly, that's
what I'm saying.

Of course he's coming.

â™ª After all â™ª

â™ª I'm only human after all â™ª

â™ª Don't put your blame on me â™ª

No, I can't.

You wish, I'm picking
up Logan first.

No, I'm already packed.

My parents are letting
me take theirs.

I was gonna buy I new one,

but I figure I'll wait
until after the trip.

See clerk.

I gotta let you go.

I hate when people are pumping
gas and on the phone anyway.

All right.

I do too.

Later.

â™ª Don't put your blame on me â™ª

â™ª Don't put your blame on me â™ª

I don't have time for this.

I did my part, gas
is in, let's do it.

[car door clicks]
[phone ringing]

[car door bangs]

Hey, what's up, buddy.

I was just talking about you.

Hey, you almost here?

Cool.

[fast tempo rock music]
[muffled singing]

What's up, man?
Hey.

How about you?

You all set, you all packed?

Yeah, stuff's actually
back at the house.

But my question is,

isn't it supposed to be
like colder up north?

Why are we going up there again?

Poor, baby, get ya some
long underwear or something.

How much you wanna bet your
sister's not even packed yet?

I don't know anymore, man.

She's your girlfriend
shouldn't you know?


Just call her really quick.

[phone ringing]
[Andy humming]

â™ª With a kind-eyed â™ª

Yo, Adrian, you guys
here yet? [giggles]

Oh, hi, sweetie.

You know what, Mia's
actually already here.

Yeah, I just told her that'd
it be easier to come over.

Why do you sound so surprised?

Okay, yeah.

You know what say hi real
quick, I gotta finish up here.

It's the boys.

â™ª Waking dream â™ª

Hello.

Hi, take your time.

I don't think Andy's
even packed yet.

Oh, hey, pick up Ms.
Ella May if you could.

She had a last minute casting,

and I'm sure she's at that
coffee shop she likes.

I have her bags her already.

Could you get me a
soy latte please?

Thanks, mister,
you're a sweetheart.

I'll text Ella to call you guys.

See ya soon.

â™ª Our lips they part
as sorry slips out â™ª

â™ª What's wrong and
what is right â™ª

â™ª Do I stay or do I
go away from here â™ª

â™ª It just feels so comfortable â™ª

â™ª It's the only place that
I have called my home â™ª

â™ª It's hard to move when
you just don't know â™ª

â™ª And I just don't know â™ª

Hey, are you guys
in the city already?

Good.

Oh, I see you.

Hi.

You look pretty.

Hey, can I get a
tall double soy latte

with six stevia packets, please?

I know it's a problem.

Thanks, keep the change.

No, I don't.

What?

Look pretty.

Bad casting.

[Ella sighs]

I just hate never
feeling thin enough.

I'm not gonna starve
myself just to model,

too much of a foodie.

[fast tempo rock music]
[car door bangs]

[car door bangs]

Suisse mocha latte no foam.

Solid menu choice.
Very excellent choice.

Definitely excellent.

Definitely, definitely
get underwear

at Kmart, yeah, definitely.

Let me tell you a little
something about Kmart, okay, Ray?

Yeah.

Kmart sucks.
Yeah.


Dad lets me drive
slow on the driveway.

â™ª Wanna do is just go home â™ª

[Blake and Logan laughing]

God, I love "Rain
Man". [laughs]

[ominous music]

[police radio chattering]

[siren wailing]

[camera snaps]
[brooding music]

[siren wailing]
[police radio chattering]

[car door bangs]

I got here as soon as could.
Hey!

What's going on?
Excuse me, sir.

I'm gonna need you
to take a step back.

This is my property.

What happened to the school?

Sir, just please calm down.

It's okay, he
can come through.

I'm afraid you had
a break in, mister?

Nielsen.

What happened?

What did they want?

Well, as of right
now looks as though

they just tried to get in
out of the storm last night,

but unfortunately the
break in is the least

of my concerns at the
moment, Mr. Nielsen.

What do you mean?

What did they leave?

Oh, they're still here.

So you caught them.

Actually they called us.

And I'm sorry to inform you

but you've had a double
homicide at your building.

Now the survivors are saying,

"That someone or something
tired to attack them."

Although they haven't
been very descriptive.

You wouldn't know anything
about this would you, sir?

Of course not.

Could you come with me please?

[dramatic music]

Detective Young,
this is Mr. Nielsen,

the owner of the school.

Oh, whoops, I guess
that's kinda gross, huh?

Whew.

Rumor has it you have
surveillance here.

Please tell me you
actually use it.

Yes, yes, of course,
it's on a motion sensor.

I've had some problems with
vandalism and squatters lately.

Oh, I'd say you have
a few more problems now.

I'm gonna need to take a
look at those recordings.

I sure hope he's
got something.

Yeah, please.
[suspenseful music]

[hand tapping]

[door clicks]

I just updated
this operation system

so it may take me a
little while to navigate.

Okay, well, I'm pretty sure

we can have someone
help you figure it out.

Get this going for me.

I'm gonna go talk to 'em.
Okay.

How many are there?

There's three.

Hear no evil, see no
evil, speak no evil.

They say, "They're
telling us everything,"

but I just don't think
it's that simple.

I'm gonna go ask
them some questions,

you guys come and get me as soon

as surveillance
is up, you got it?


Sometimes I feel
like pack too much

but then whenever I
get where I'm going,

I never have anything
that I actually want.

Is it gonna be cold
where we're going?

'Cause I know we're going north

but in my mind I guess
I always [grunts]

consider Wisconsin and
Illinois both to be north but-

You know when you're
not physically here

to see the other person

you'd assume you're
having a conversation

with your suitcase.


I knew you were
there by the the way.

You didn't forget
Ella did you?

I knew we forgot something.

[Mia laughs]

Got you these for the trip.

Oh.

Missed you.
Did you?

Totally.

I miss you anytime
I leave the room.

Is that for me?


Blake, could you help me

carry my bags and
stuff downstairs?

For sure.

Uh, is this it?
Yeah.

â™ª I'm a runaway â™ª

My bags are just
in the hallway.

Yes, please leave the room.

Logan, I miss you every
time I leave you too.

Oh, dude, no.

â™ª Runaway, I don't want â™ª

Hey, do you think I could
borrow a pillow for the ride?

Yeah, let me grab you one.

â™ª Guess I'll find it on my own â™ª

Logan, why do you look
so angry in this photo?

You should try smiling.

I wanted my real
mom in the picture.

â™ª In Milwaukee â™ª

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

Yeah.
Okay.

â™ª I don't know if I'm ready â™ª

â™ª I don't think that I'm ready â™ª

â™ª I'm a runaway â™ª

â™ª I don't want to deal â™ª

â™ª With all of this emotion â™ª

You all right, Logan?

Yeah.

â™ª I'm sure I'll â™ª

It's okay.

Let's just try to have a
good time on this trip, okay?

I really want this to be good.

â™ª Guess I'll find it on my own â™ª

I wanted my dad to be
in that picture too,

but I'm learning that I,
well, we both have to live

with the decisions
that our parents made.

I can be a good
sister if you let me.

â™ª Who can keep up, can keep up â™ª

[woman vocalizing]

Logan, what are you doing?

What's wrong with you?

What?

I was just messing around.

It was just a joke, jeez.

â™ª One day I'll find
someone who can keep up â™ª

[Andy sighs]

â™ª 'Cause I'm a runaway â™ª

â™ª I don't want to deal â™ª

â™ª With all of this emotion â™ª

â™ª I don't know what I feel â™ª

â™ª I'm a runaway â™ª

â™ª I don't want â™ª


She just wanted
help making sure

she turned the dryer
off the right way.

I just had a few last
minute things in the wash.

Oh, just love the way clothes
feel fresh out of the dryer,

so soft and warm.

Logan, do you
have all your stuff?

Yeah, yeah, it's
all right here.

All right, then
come on, let's go.

I wanna get in the
car, I wanna nap.

Cute scarf.

It's a little girly but it
looks good with your eyes.

Are we leaving for like
a week and no one told me?

'Cause I brought a sweatshirt
and some deodorant.

Dude, they're girls,
one bag's just for shoes.

Actually two of
mine are for shoes.

What?

Come on it's snow
boots and stuff,

they're bigger than
just regular shoes.

Here you go, babe.

I rolled it up as tight
as I possibly could.

I think it's kind of stupid

to bring more than
one bag on a trip,

especially when you're going
with a group of people,

it's like kind of
inconsiderate you know.

People do the same
things on airplanes,

it's like just 'cause there's
a two carry-on bag limit

they insist on bringing
two carry-on bags,

and more often than not

they don't even need half
the stuff that they brought.

Oh, I'm so excited to
just be in a warm cabin

in front of a frosted window,

sipping a mug of hot cocoa.

You can have your hot
cocoa, I'll have my beer.

What about when you
come in from the snow

and you wanna warm up?
Beer.

Well, what about
when we sit down

all snugly for breakfast?

Especially beer.

I heard beer is really good

over peanut butter
Captain Crunch.

Hey oh.
Ew, that is so gross.

We should try that,
you get the cereal.

You get the beer.

Do we have everything?

I think we're ready to go.

Hey, Ella, tell your agents
you need a few days off

from the world of modeling.

Let's go.

I have to go.

Lock up, Mom would
freak if you don't.

Everyone's so paranoid.

Just do it.

Oh, Logan, could
you grab that pillow?

I totally forgot it.

Does your guys' maid still
come when you're away?

Yeah, we trust
her, she has a key,

and also we have nanny cams

so we'd know if
anything happened.

Nanny cams?

Like in teddy bears?

I mean we're in college.

Yeah, I know,
they're still there.

You know whenever Blake
and I like, you know,

we have to turn the
cameras around. [laughs]

everyone got what they need?

Yeah.
Okay, let's go.

Let's go.
Go, go, go.

Let's do this.

I love this plan, I'm
excited to be a part of it.

[car doors clicking]

[car door bangs]

Wait, where is your
aunt's cabin again, Blake?

Wausau, it's a little
snow town in Wisconsin,

Rib Mountain State Park,
highest snow peaks around here.

Are there any
cute boys in Wausau?

I know of one at least.

Two if you count Logan.

[Mia laughs]

[car engine revving]

So if Illinois
is the bear state

then what's Wisconsin?

'Cause obviously there
are bears in Wisconsin too

but like what's on its flag?

Who cares.
Chill for a second, okay.

We have the whole trip to
talk about bears and flags.

Uh, we good, we
ready, we comfortable?

Yes, can we just go already?

All right, Grand Prix
snowboarding here we come.

you're so dramatic.

[upbeat rock music]

[Mia laughs]

So seriously though,

like what's different
about Wisconsin?

More snow and great beer.

Okay, right, but like what's
special about the state?

We all learned about
our country in school,

what is that people in
Wisconsin are proud of?

Why is so important?
No.

I'm just saying that
it says a lot about us

if we don't know anything
about our country,

you know what I mean?

Like I'm not trying
to say anything bad

but like we're lazy.

I bet people don't
even really know

that Illinois is the bear state.

I've lived in
Illinois my entire life

and I've never even seen a bear,

so I mean if it
is the bear state

where the hell
are all the bears?

No, it's called the bear state

because of like
you know football.

And I'm sure all the
bears are like south.

See this is the thing,

I just wish people
were smarter, okay.

All I know is that Illinois
bear state, Illinois bear state.

Illinois is most definitely
not the bear state.

Yeah, it is, Blake.

There's not a bear on the
flag or anything like that.

And it's definitely not
because of the Chicago Bears

or even the Cubs
for that matter.

Illinois is the Prairie State,

also referred to as the Lincoln
State but not officially.

And Wisconsin is often referred

to as the Dairy State
or the Dairy Land,

but it technically doesn't have
an official nickname at all.

Wow.

What?

You are one pathetic loser.

[Mia laughing]

Sorry, can't help
I remember stuff.

Oh, honey, I'm like
really impressed. [giggles]

Okay, but that brings
me to my original query,

um, what's the bear state then?

Well, there's a bear
on the California flag

but it's not the bear state,

it's just the
official state animal.

Shut up, how do you know that?

You're totally making this up.

Google it.

Plus my dad listen to a lot

of the Red Hot
Chili Peppers band

and there's a lot of stuff
about California in there.

â™ª California animal is a bear â™ª

See Logan knows what
I'm talking about.

Okay, okay, so you're safe
from being a complete loser.

You only know about
California because of music.

So you know facts
about every state?

No, just Illinois,
Wisconsin, and California.

[Logan laughs]

â™ª Always lay the blame on me â™ª

Hey.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Shoot, you know what?

We're gonna have to
reschedule that until-

I actually have to send an
email quickly to work too.

him a call if you want.

This is incredible.
Sure, yeah.

Why?
That's totally fine.

I just can't believe how
dependent we are on our phones.

I hear you, bro.

Social media, it's like
you're walking down the street

and there's a guy
walking towards you

and he's on his phone,

and he's just still like
not even there, you know.

I just wish that on this
trip that we could talk

to each other.
Okay, yeah, we'll talk soon.

Oh, yeah, we got
lots to talk about.

Okay, okay.
You know,

why do we always have
to be on our phones?

Okay, all right.
Why do we always have-

Okay.
To be available to everyone?


Hold on, man, I gotta
check this really quick.

Smartphones have only been
around for like 10 years

we shouldn't be.
[phone ringing]

Hi, you've reached
Blake's voicemail.

He's off on a trip right now,

but he'd be happy to take
your call when he gets back.

Okay, buh-bye.

Wow, what's wrong with you?

Phones are just things
that people think they need.

You need a new phone?
Is your phone broken?

We can probably order one,
we can have it delivered.

I bet you couldn't go
two days without a phone.

I could.

Actually my phone
isn't even something

that I consider to be
necessary for my daily life.

I mean some people it's
like it's out of control,

all they do is you know talk,

and text, and, and social media.

They're just like in their
phone all the, [gasps]

oh, my gosh, you guys,
there's this one guy,

this is really funny, he's
in my pottery class, okay,

and his name is Anthony,
and fun fact Anthony

actually by definition
means man of little words.

You guys, he sits there during
class and he just talks.

I mean like he's under the table

like whispering into his phone,

he's texting, he's like
scrolling through social media.

He just never stops this guy.

My teacher's at the
front of the class

like teaching us
how to do pottery,

meanwhile he's
just blabbing away

as if his whole life is
one giant conversation,

has so much to say all
the time, it's just-

That's not the point here.

â™ª I thought you had gone away â™ª

I was just trying to say

that I think that
maybe for this weekend

we should ditch our phones.

We can make a pact together.

You know put 'em in
a bag or something

and not touch 'em
till we get home.

Let's just see if we can do it.

Survivor mode for real.

Oh, but suppose
you get to keep yours

for emergency purposes.

I already turned mine off.

Well, I won't need mine.

I think it'd be fun not to
have them for a few days.

Are you serious?

We're just like not
gonna have our phones

for like three days,
what if I need it?

My god, it's not like we're
going to a desolate island,

this is a manmade resort,

there'll be people everywhere.

And I bet there'll be one,

maybe even two
phones in the cabin.

You guys it's not a big deal,

I just thought
it'd be nice for us

to focus on people right in
front of us live and in person.

The person that I
wanna talk to most

is already with me.

See, I'll be with
you the whole time,

you won't have to call anyone.

Oh, you, you
thought I meant you.

Uh, see I was actually
referring to Ella.

[Ella laughs]

You know what, fine
here, just take it,

but if I need it
I'm gonna get it.

Is Ella still
alive back there?

â™ª Yes, I know it's wrong â™ª

Hey, I'm gonna call you back.

What?

Can I see your
phone for a sec?


We are gonna turn them
off during the trip.

What?

Why?

Are we living like
the olden days?

Just throw it
somewhere back there.

Are you sure this
is a good idea, man?

Think of it like a
challenge, it'll be fun.

I have agents, like
what if they call

for a casting or, or
I book an audition?

It's just for the weekend.

Your agency's not open
on the weekend right?

Usually, but you know
sometimes things come up.

Okay, well, then you can
check in with them on Monday.

Don't even tell me
where you put it, Logan.

I don't wanna know.

So how do we know
how to get there?

Uh.
[traffic humming]

[fan whirring]
[upbeat music]

I got the door.

Oh, it's much warmer in here.

Hey, how are ya?

Real well, yep, real well.

Started my shift
about 6:00 am today.

Wow, that is early, 6:00 am.

You'd be surprised
actually how many people

are up and moving
at that time of day.

I'll tell you it is more
than you would think,

it's a busy time.

Yeah, um, what exit number
do I take to get into Wausau?

I'm trying to get to Granite
Peak, it's a ski resort.

Well, let me see
my charts here.

[paper rustling]

All right, all right, all right.

I knew a girl in Germantown
once, and you go up there,

and well, I'm not exactly sure.

I do know it is in
Wisconsin though.

[Attendant and Blake laughing]

Little welcome center humor.

Uh, all right, you
go past Milwaukee,

and then it's, it's way
northwest of Green Bay even,

so you've got quite
a ways to go yet,

three, four, hours, I'd say.

Be careful.

It's a good thing
you told us be careful

'cause, uh, should we
try to be not careful?

No, please be careful
on your way up there.

Why do you say that?

We've got some heavy
weather coming in.

We'll catch it down here too.

Temperature's changing,
can't you feel it, the cold?

I think we'll be okay.

Work together,
keep your eyes open,

you'll find the right way.

Good luck.

Thank you, and, uh, good
luck to you, my good sir.

Remember when I wanted to
work at a welcome center?

Yeah, I've changed my mind.

That guy's crazy.

[ominous music]

[group chattering]

[dramatic music]

[Mia laughing]

[suspenseful music]

I'm bored.

I'm gonna watch a movie.

Blake, where do you
keep the movies?

I don't think I have
any in here actually?

You have a DVD player
in your car and no DVDs?

Sorry, didn't think about it.

dropping temperatures.

As it gets later-

I've got something
we can watch.

rainy day into snow.

I was gonna wait till we
got to the cabin but, uh.

hour reducing visibility.

Hey, Blake, I have
a surprise for you.


What are you talking about?
To stay safe, so stay-

I found those old moves
that we used to make,

you know in the,
in the back yard.

Remember when we
were action stars?

No way, you found those?

Yeah, dude,
they're so hilarious.

Um, I know how much
they meant to you

so I had them
transferred to a disc.

I wanted to wait to surprise
you up at the cabin,

you know thought we
all could watch 'em,

get a kick out of
'em, laugh a little.

Dude, that is so awesome.

Logan, that's really sweet.

I can't wait to watch.

Yeah, I wanna see
you guys as little kids

running around playing
in the backyard.

Hand it up, man.

Pass it to my navigator.

Yeah, they're
so hilarious, man.

You were such a jerk.

You took everything
so seriously.

And you wanna know what else?

He always had me be the bad guy

because he wanted
to be the hero.

Oh, I bet he just
always wanted to win.

Oh, the bad guy
wins sometimes.

I didn't always wanna
be the hero, shut up.

Andy, it's that one right there.

All right, we're all set.

Oh, my gosh,

you guys are adorable.
We both take three paces,

turn, and draw.


Boom, boom!
Bang!

I got you, I got you!
I got you first!

[Young Logan groans]

Check this out right
here, right here.

Blake looks right at the camera

as he's about to take me down.

Okay.

[Mia laughs]

stop, that tickles.

Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

Bang.
[Young Logan groans]

Rookie mistake.

Man.
Okay, you're dead.

I miss that stuff so much.

[Young Blake] Cut!

[police radio clicking]

[brooding music]
[police radio chattering]

[door clicks]

[footsteps crunching]

our battery suspect

is at 318 East 3rd Street,
is that related to your call

or do you want a
different patrol unit?

Well, I suppose the
story they're telling us

may have actually happened.

So you believe them?

[police radio chattering]

No.

suspect or was the victim?

No, just a feeling I got.

I don't think they're
telling the truth.

I mean look at all
this, the blood,

the, the windshield, the arrow.

Two of 'em were murdered,

not only that the
two who were murdered

are brother and sister.

Their heads are just on
a little too straight.

You got the surveillance
footage up yet?

Still working on it.

Who's working on it?

I am.

So is the system out here?

System?

The surveillance system.

No.
It isn't, is it.

Get inside and look at it.

Man, I gotta see that video.

[siren wailing]

[Detective Young sighs]

I wanna see the video.

[ominous music]

[wipers whirring]

[branch whooshes]
[car smashing]

[group yelling]

[tires screeching]

[glass shattering]


Oh, my god, what happened?

Did you fall asleep?

No, no, I just
couldn't see anything.

Everyone okay?

Logan?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

we're, we're okay.

Holy shit, Blake,
are you okay?

Oh, my god, it's
like a bomb went off.

What happened?

There's a tree in here.

I think I hit a branch
or something, I'm not sure.

I'm gonna go check it out.
[Andy] Ugh, it's so cold.

[car door clicks]

[suspenseful music]
[car door bangs]

[footsteps crunching]

I've never seen anything
like this before, man.

What you just didn't see it?

I couldn't see anything.

What are we gonna do?

We gotta get inside somewhere.

Do you remember
passing anything?

I haven't seen
anything but snow

for the past for the past hour.

What's that?

What?

That.

It's like a light
pole or something.

See it.

Nice, man, it's
gotta be a gas station.

Think you can
drive over there?

It's gonna be interesting.

[car door clicks]

[car door bangs]

We don't have service
on any of these.

What are we gonna do?
We're gonna have

to drive a little bit.
How?

The windshield is cracked,
the window is gone,

there's snow coming
in, we're freezing.

We don't have a choice.

There's a light up
there or something,

I wanna go check it out, and
see if we can get some shelter.

I think it's a gas station.

Are you sure you
can even drive?

No, let's find out.

[car rumbling]

[branch cracking]

Dammit, look at those scratches.

Focus, Blake, we're freezing.

Is that it?

What is it?

I don't even know if
I'm on the road anymore,

I can't see anything.

hit another tree.

Is it store?

It looks like
a rundown school.

I think we're
in a parking lot.

Blake, pull forward, we can
probably get inside there.

This is perfect.

Let's get in and get warm.

I don't think anybody's
here, it's probably locked.

Doesn't mean we can't go in.

just gonna break in?

wait in the car if you want.

That was mean.

Come on, I was kidding.

It's okay, let's go.

What there's no hotels
around here or anything?

This is the dumbest
place to stop.

Who would ever stop here?

We just did.

[car door clicks]

[car door clicks]

[footsteps crunching]

[car door bangs]

[car doors banging]

[footsteps crunching]

It is a school.

It looks abandoned.

[door banging]

Maybe there's another door.

Wanna kick it in?

[ominous music]

[wind blowing]

[police radio chattering]

That's very Robin Hood.

[siren wailing]

Hmm.

[bow thuds]

[hands slapping]

[glass shattering]
[ominous music]

[door bangs]
[wind blowing]

I'm so cold.

[door bangs]

It's so cold.

I'm so hungry.

I know you guys are
probably hungry too.

Are we gonna get in
trouble for coming in here?

Are the police gonna come?

Are we gonna get arrested?

Andy, just try to think about
one thing at a time, okay?

What's that supposed to mean?

I can think about
whatever I want.

We just breaked and entering

and we're trespassing right now.

Well, I'd rather
be trespassing

than freezing to
death in a blizzard!

Okay, okay, settle down.

Look, we're inside
and we're safe now.

We just tell the owner
about the snow storm

and pay for the damages.

This place looks totally
out of commission anyway.

Now he's got an excuse
to get a new door.

Hey, what do we do now?
Should we try to call somebody?

We left all the
phones in the car.

They don't have
any service anyway.

I think we should
still get them,

they might work in here.

It's okay, we
can use the light.

I'm gonna go back out to the
car and get them. We are fine.

We're here together
and we are fine.

We should try to
find some real lights,

these ones aren't working.


Hey look, there's a
light on downstairs.

Should I go try maybe
find like a circuit panel,

or some flashlights,
or something?

Might have to
break and entering.

Oh, great, so now
we're trespassing

and we're stealing
flashlights, oh fun.

No, it's borrowing,
it's different.

There's a bunch of
blankets in the car.

I'm gonna go back out
through that freezing hell

and get those too.

I'll come with you.

I actually, I brought snacks
and I know where they are.

Look, honey, I'm breaking
through and exiting.

[door clicks]
[wind blowing]

Well, I'm gonna go
search for a flashlight.

We can use it until Logan
figures out the power.

Yeah, yeah, and I'm
like really hungry

so I guess I'll go
look for some food.

Maybe they have like
snacks, or canned goods,

or other non-perishables,

or maybe even like a
cafeteria or something.

I'm just gonna go look for that.

[door clicks]

[door creaks]
[motor humming]

Now we're talking.

[door bangs]

[metal clanging]

[buttons clicking]

Hmm.

[phone clanging]

[suspenseful music]

[gentle somber music]
[light buzzing]

Logan.

[suspenseful music]
[Andy yelling]

[mannequins thudding]

[ominous music]

Andy?

[suspenseful music]
[wind blowing]

Hey, Blake, I'm
gonna go around back

and see if there's somewhere
I can go pee, okay?

[ominous music]

[switch clicking]

[light clicks]

[suspenseful music]

[door bangs]

Hello.

[wind blowing]
[footsteps crunching]

[door clicks]

[door bangs]

[suspenseful music]

[Andy screams]

Guys?

What are you doing?

Logan, where's Andy?

There's somebody here.

What?

[dramatic music]

Logan, Logan, what happened?

Andy.

We, we have to
call an ambulance.

The phones are down.

What happened?

I saw somebody, Mia.

Somebody did this.

I saw them run
towards the stairs.

That's where I was,
they coulda killed me.

Where's Blake?

Oh, my god, we, we
have to help her.

Check if she's breathing.

She's not.

She's dead.
Logan!

Okay, okay, we have to
get her to a hospital.

Logan, do something
for once in your life!

What the hell?

Andy, Andy!

God, Andy, come on,
come on, wake up, Andy.

Andy, come on.

What happened?
There's somebody here, man.

There's somebody after us.

God, Blake, we have to
get her to a hospital.

How did this happen?

I saw somebody, man.

I, I just found her like that.

What?

Man, I heard a scream,

and, and I was looking
for a flashlight,

and then I just I found her
like that on the floor, man.

I, I don't know, I, I-

What do you mean
you saw someone?

How did this happen, Logan?

I just found her
like that, man!

We've got to do something!

Take this, do it!

What are you doing, man?

No you, you shouldn't move her.

[Blake grunts]

Blake.

Move!
Blake, listen to me,

man, there's a killer
on the loose somewhere!

God, Logan stop saying
that, you're scaring me!

Fine!

Be scared!

I'm scared shitless right now.

[door clicks]
[wind blowing]

[door bangs]
[gentle somber music]

[car door bangs]

[car door bangs]

[car engine revving]

[tires crunching]

[door clicks]

Blake!

Stop be crazy, man.

What are you gonna do?

Okay, okay.

[door clicks]

[suspenseful music]

[tires screeching]

Shit!

it's not gonna work!

I'm telling the truth!

What are you doing?

Hello.

[wind blowing]
[car door clicks]

[car door bangs]

[somber music]

[car door clicks]

[suspenseful music]

[Mia screams]

[Mia panting]

God, what?

are you doing?

I, I had to pee,

so I just went to go find
someplace with light.

That doesn't even make sense.

What were you still
doing outside?

How did you get in?

The door's unlocked.

Why, what's wrong?

Did something happen?

What?

I told you couldn't
leave, man, it's impossible.

You can't see your hand in
front of your face out there,

what were you thinking?
Logan.

I know there's
somebody here, man.

I saw somebody.

What makes you say that, huh?

Where are they,
where are their car?

Why aren't there any lights on?

There's was a light on, man.

I can't believe she's dead.

She is though?

What is wrong with you?

What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

that room with her?

What was doing there?

Look, man, I'm your best
friend you can believe me.

I was in another
room down the hall,

and I swear I saw like
a figure or a shadow,

or something leave
that room, man.

There was somebody
else in there with her.

I just found her like this.
You saw a figure?

Yes, I did, man!

What, are you upset because
you didn't know where I was?

Oh, why is that, Blake?

Oh, because you weren't here.

So you know what, man? If you
wanna accuse me of something

then go ahead and accuse me,

but for all I know you could
have been that figure, man.

Oh, please, okay, I wasn't
in here, I was outside!


Because I was with
Ella, you little shit.

Where is Ella?

Blake, hey, what happened?


What?
Just now where were you?

I was outside
with you, wasn't I?

I left a long time ago.

I was outside and back multiple
times since I saw you last.

Where did you go?

I told you I had
to go around back,

I just really had to pee,

and then I found and
entrance back. [gasps]

These are Andy's.

She let me borrow them.

Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

Where is Andy?

Is she hurt?

Andy?

Oh!

What, no!

What did you do?

What happened?

Where'd you go?

Did you come back inside?

Blake, just settle down.

Oh, settle down?

Yes, we need to just
talk about this, man.

I'm still freaking out
'cause I know I saw somebody.

You saw somebody, what?

What do you mean?

Look I just, I think
Logan is right, all right.

If we just calm down we can
figure out what happened.

We're all shaken up, we
should have never separated.

Just calm down.

Where were you
when I was outside?

I know how you felt about
Andy too. You all hated her.

Don't you blame me. All
right, if you really loved her

the way you said you did

you never would
have cheated on her.

What?

Oh, don't pretend now.

You never really said
no, Blake, it takes two.

she talking about?

Shut up.

You cheated on
my sister with Mia.

How dare you call me liar,
man, you're the liar!

Chill out, okay.

You want me to calm down
then let's calm down.

But we gotta get
her out of here.

How are we gonna do that?

We're stuck here man!

You see it out there,
and she's already dead,

so all we can do is wait.

No way, man, we gotta
figure this out right now.

We need to make this right.

How can anything
possibly make this right?

Why do we have to wait,

why can't we call
somebody for help?

'Cause the phones are down.

You love that don't you?

Stop it!

Knock it off! All right,
would you just stop acting

like a child for three seconds?

Let's try our phones
all right, all of them,

maybe one of them will work now.

I'm, I'm not gonna be next.


[glass clanging]

How'd they break this glass?

I'm assuming an object was used.

They used the
fire extinguisher

that was hanging next to
it, then took this ax.

[glass clangs]
Run any prints on this?

They've already been sent in.

24 hours.

Yes, sir.

All right.

[glass shattering]
[ominous music]


Look whether or
not you believe me,

I know I saw somebody, I want
something to defend myself.

We all should get something.

I don't think
that's a good idea.

Oh, no one's killing me.

Listen, we need to be
careful, this is serious.

That's what I'm doing.

This is being careful.

Nobody splits
up, nobody alone.

Let's find an open area.

Is there a gym?

Yeah, it's downstairs.

Let's get to this gym, stay
together, and try our phones.

What about Andy?

I honestly think it's best
if we stop moving her around.

[ominous music]

[Blake crying]

[fist thudding]

We should all take those.

Remember when we used to hunt,
now we can hunt the killer.

Just shut up, Logan.

What are you doing?

[arrow thuds]

Sick.

Guys, can we focus
on the phones, please.

We need to get help.

There's still no service.

Mines not even working.

It's so cold, I
think it's frozen.

Same with mine.

Oh, let's see, this one
has a flashing light.

Andy's, is it working?

I can see you know.

It's blinking, no service.

I told you they wouldn't work.

Thanks for the help, Logan.

Look, I know you're all upset

but don't throw this at me.

So far I've been right.

I told you that you couldn't
take the car and you didn't.

I told you that the cellphones
wouldn't work and they don't.

I've been right, Blake.

I know that there
is someone here,

and he is just waiting
for us to make a mistake.

Stop it.

What are you even talking
about, make a mistake?

Guys, fighting each other
isn't gonna help anything.

We should retrace our steps.

Okay, just, just
breathe for a second.

We need to retrace our
steps to this very moment

and try to figure what
could have happened.

That's a good idea.

We should just explain
what we all saw,

and what we all heard.

Fine, let's do
that, best friend.

Blake, stop it.

Just sit down, okay?

It's a good place to start.

All right, fine.

I went back out to the car

to get the blankets
and the phone bag,

I came back in to find
you two over Andy's body.

There, that's it, next.

Blake, just calm down.

I am calm!

Okay, why don't we
start from this morning

and work our way until now.

I read somewhere that the
further back you recall

the more specific
details you remember

up to the present moment.

We certainly have
time for it, right?

That's not true.
She's right.

Just start from the morning,

and then we can piece
everything together.

This is ridiculous.

You didn't do
it, right, Blake?


I mean you loved her, right?

Prove it.

All right, Blake, let's
take it one more time

all the way from the beginning.

[police radio chattering]

I woke up with my
girlfriend, Andrea,

packed up my stuff, and
called my buddy, Logan.

Wanted to fill up with gas
before we hit the road,

so I fill it up at
the gas station.

Then headed on to
West Washington,

that's where I was
picking Logan up.

So one of these girls out
here they're your girlfriend?

No, my girlfriend was the
one who died, Andy, Andrea.

That's right.

Terribly sorry about that.

Please continue.

I picked him up on the
corner of the street,

got in the car, and used
his phone to call Andy.

You called her.

Yeah, I called Andy.

I called my girlfriend.

My gosh, she's.

Sit down.

[police radio chattering]

Go ahead.

From there I picked up Ella,

she's the other girl out there.

She's a model.

Hmm, I see.

These are some beautiful girls

you spend your time with, Blake.

[police radio chattering]

suspect or was the victim?

We went from there
to, to the house, uh,

Logan and Andy's parents' house.

We all went inside.

Logan went straight upstairs

but I was thirsty so I, I went
into the kitchen for a drink.

Got these mittens for Andy.

Was really excited to give
them to her for the trip.

So I went upstairs, I
said hello to everyone,

helped the girls
bring their bags down.

Mia asked me to help
her turn off the dryer,

so we went into the
laundry room together,

grabbed some of her
clothes for the trip.

She such a girl you know.

Hmm.

She'll pack an entire wardrobe
just for a weekend trip.

Crazy.

We loaded up the car, got in,

we were all together until
we got to the school.

We made a pact together,
turn off our phones,

not use 'em, just wanted to
spend time with each other.

Storm got really bad,

worse than anything I've
ever seen, actually.

That's when I hit the tree, it
must have fallen in the road,

we crashed, and saw a light,
and we just kept driving to it

hoping we wouldn't
hit anything else.

Yeah, that must
have been terrifying.

That was a pretty
bad wreck out there.

Seems chaotic.

It was, but we handled it.

Once we got to the school
we calmed down a little bit.

Was that before or
after you broke in?

After.

We were all together inside,

but Ella and I went
back out to the car

to get blankets
and, and the phones.

She told me, "She had to pee,"

so she went around the back
of the building I guess.

I waited for her but
I didn't see her,

so I just figured
she went in, inside.

When I get in there
was no one in there,

I just, I went
downstairs and that's,

that's where I
found Mia and Logan

standing over Andy's body.

Now Logan tried to tell me
that there was someone there,

that, that someone killed
Andy, but I didn't listen.

I, I was really shaken.

Logan, I just,

why would Logan think there
was someone else here?

'Cause he saw someone.

He was right, there
was someone here.

They, they came
in the back door,

that's, that's what
I think at least.

He was best friend, there was
no reason he would lie to me.

[police radio chattering]

He even broke the
ax case out there,

he wanted to protect us.

Still don't know why someone

would wanna shoot him like that.

Maybe they wanted the
car and just killed him.

God, I've known
him my whole life.

[police radio chattering]

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, um,

I just don't think
it's really hit me yet.

I understand.

Well, I got one for you,

did you actually see
anybody shoot Logan?

I mean, Blake, did you actually
see anybody here at all?

No.

We were all in
the janitor's room

when he went out to the car.

I, I heard something but I
guess I just figured it was him.

But you carried a weapon
last night too didn't you?

A bow and arrow.

Yes.

Yes.

Did you have that with you

when you went to
find Logan's body?

No, no, I left it in the gym.

I never shot it.

I don't really like guns,

or, or shooting, or
anything like that.

Really?

Wow, I used to love shooting
stuff when I was a kid.

I mean, I'd even just
play guns in the backyard

with my friends, cops and
robbers, you know army,

even like I was hunting.

But I did always like
being a cop the best.

You know I liked to,
to play the hero,

to get the other guy.

And a bow and arrow, wow,
I mean that's amazing.

That's like Rambo style.

Are you sure?

[ominous music]

All I know is that
when I came back in

Ella had on Andy's mittens,

you two were hovering
over her body,

and Logan had
blood on his hands.

You had blood on your
hands too, asshole.


That got us nowhere.

Someone must know
something better than that.

How about you, Ella?

Said, "You came in
through a back door,"

what was it just unlocked?

Yes.

Blake, just let
her tell her story.

Go ahead, Ella,
from the beginning.

Okay.

But I just, I just wanna say
that I don't wanna kill anyone.

I don't even think
I can kill anything.

And I definitely
did not kill Andy.

No one saying that you did.

We're just trying to
put everything together.

Okay.

[Ella sighs]

This morning, uh,

I went to a casting
for a jeans commercial.

It was really dumb, and
I just hated being there.

And then I went to get coffee,

and while I was waiting
for my order to arrive

you texted me, and then I, um,

I talked to the girl behind
the counter for a little bit,

and then I, I excused
myself to call Blake.

And then I was in the car
with you guys, you remember.

When we got the house I, uh,

I went to find a lip
gloss from, from my bags,

I had already brought them over.

And then we were in the car,

I was with you guys up,
up until we got here.

Then Blake and I went outside
to get blankets and, and food,

and I really had to pee,

and, and I told him, I, I
told you that I had to pee,

so I, I went around back,

that is when I found the
door, and there was a light.

And yeah, the door was
unlocked, and I opened it,

but I still had to pee

so I just decided to
go in the, the snow,

and, uh, there was something
outside that scared me.

I heard a noise or something in,

in the bushes next
to the school,

and so I ran back inside,

and that's when I ran into
Mia, and she was mad at me

for some reason or
seemed mad at me,

and she wouldn't tell
me what was going on,

and she asked about Andy.

I didn't even know
anything had happened.

I was scared myself.

Wait, so do you have any idea

what the noise was you
heard in the bushes?

No, I know it was enough to
make me not wanna find out.

I was gonna tell you guys-
I told you

Ella saw something too.

Ella didn't see anyone.

There are a million things

that coulda made those noises.

Uh, maybe the wind and the snow

may have played a part in it.

Why are you being
like this, Blake?

I'm trying to tell
you the truth, man.

There's something
you're not saying.

Oh, you would know all about
that, hmm, keeping secrets.

Oh, but don't worry,

I'm sure Andy didn't
cheat on you with anybody.

My sister was better than that.

So all the sudden
she's your sister now?

Knock it off both of you!

We have only heard two stories

and there is no room
for pointing fingers!

Just shut up and listen!

[Detective Young] I would
like you to walk me through

everything you can
remember from last night.

I thought I already did that.

Yes, you did, but
it's been a long night,

and now you've had a couple
hours to think about it.

I thought maybe
together we could just

go over it one more time

and see if there's anything
you missed, sound good?

Andy is my friend.

Was.

That's mean.

Yes, but it also the truth,

and that is a point I
wanna make with you.

[police radio chattering]

Andy was my friend.

Mm-hmm.

So was Logan.

They were good people, family.

We had all been friends
for a really long time.

The day started out at
Andy and Logan's house.

Andy was really sweet
when I got there,

she, uh, she actually
made breakfast for me,

and, uh, we were
talking about the trip,

and how cold it was gonna be.

When we went
upstairs to get ready

she even let me
borrow her makeup.

She was always like
that, you know,

just so sweet and generous.

Uh, when Blake and
Logan got to the house

I noticed the mittens
he bought for Andy.

I had Blake help me
carry my bags downstairs,

and, um, we stopped to grab
some last minute things

in the laundry room.

You really pay a lot of
attention to Blake don't you?

Are you sure you guys
didn't have anything

kinda going on in secret?

What do you mean?

Well, do you really want
me to explain it to you?

Blake is like a
brother to me, okay.

Plus he's dating one
of my best friends.

Was.

Yeah.

Okay, so let's just say
you two are very close.

We're all very close.

Anyway, um, the trip
started out really great,

then we got caught in the storm.

Blake, hit some kind of a,
a tree trunk or something,

and we just, we had
to get out of the car,

that's when we saw this place.

We all just kinda settle down
once we got in the building,

and we were really
shaken up from the crash,

that's when we
decided to separate.

I don't know why we did that.

The last time I
remember seeing Andy,

she was going off to look
for Logan or food, I think.

What made me go downstairs
was I heard this scream,

and, and I saw lights reflecting

off the back wall
of the stairwell.

And I didn't know
what was happening

but I knew there was something,

and that's when I saw Logan

standing over Andy's
body in the room.

He tried to warn me that
there was someone else here.

And then Blake
and Ella found us,

and, and Blake tried
to get Andy out of here

but the storm was
just, it was too much.

Logan wanted us all to be
able to defend ourselves

and so he took the ax.

And he wanted us all
to take bow and arrows.

I think that might
have been a mistake.

Why do you say that that
might have been a mistake?

Whoever was here
used that against us.

I mean they shot Logan
just to try to get the car,

they obviously didn't have
anything of their own.

Where were you
when Logan was shot?

The janitor's room,
all three of us.

It was really stupid,

I mean we should have
stayed together, Logan too.

The killer must have just been
waiting for the right moment.

Well, how did you
even know he was shot?

He yelled.

It was, it was loud, and, and
there was so much commotion.

Blake ran up the
stairs into the lobby,

and then we just saw Logan
lying there in the snow.

And Blake and I ran out to him,

and we yelled for Ella
to call the police,

you know to see if the
phones were back up again.

And they were?
Yeah.

How convenient.

What time do you think this was?

I don't know, maybe
about four in the morning.

So you never really
saw who shot Logan,

and you never really
saw who killed Andy.

No, no, we just heard them.

Logan saw him though.

Was he sure it was a him?

No, um, no, I, I
don't know, he, uh.

Mia, is there anything
else you wanna tell me

about Ella and Blake that
maybe you're not telling me?

You do know what they
say about the truth?

Are you sure there's
not anything else?

No.

Okay.

[ominous music]

You were cheating on my sister

since the day you
started dating.

Would you knock it off, man?

She loved you.

Let me point out that
this is the first time

I've ever heard you refer
to her as your sister.

She woulda loved that too.

Too bad she's not
alive to hear it.

You don't get to talk about
my family that way, Blake.

I'm your family!

Me!

You always hated Andy.

And what because
your dad happened

to fall in love with her mom?

While they were still married!

They were all cheating
on each other,

telling lies, keeping secrets.

You were the only
one I could trust,

and I thought that
if you loved Andy

fine I could deal with it.

But then I just realized that
you were like all the rest,

you're a liar too.

You wanna hate me,
Logan, that's fine,

but I'm not going down for
something you did, you hear me?

What were you doing in
that room over her body?

Where'd you go? You were
in there before any of us.

You really think that I
could kill my own sister?

Who the hell do you
think you're talking too?

I'm not so sure anymore.

Logan!

What are you gonna do, Logan?

You're just as much of a
suspect as the rest of us.

Why don't you
share your story?

I wanna hear what
you have to say.

Well, this morning I
went to the magazine rack

to get some stuff for our trip,

you know snowboard stuff.

And then Blake showed
up a few minutes later.

After that we went
to go pick up Ella,

and then we went
straight to our house.

When we got there
I went upstairs

and Andy was talking to herself,
Mia was doing something,

but the one thing that
I remember the most

was you two coming out
of the laundry room.

I knew something was going on,

I could see it in your faces,

and I should have said
something right then and there.

I was going to use this
trip to come clean to Mia.

It wasn't enough that
you had to date my sister

but that you had to cheat on her

with the one girl that I wanted.

I was with you the whole time.

When we came here is
when we separated,

and I went down the stairs
because I saw a light on.

At the end of the hall
there was a, a boiler room,

and I went in because I was
gonna look for like a breaker

or a circuit panel or
something to get the lights on

but it was useless
without a key.

I checked a phone, there
wasn't a dial tone,

and that's when I
heard the scream,

and I heard like a thud,
or stomp, or something.

And so then I
grabbed a flashlight

and that gave me the
courage to go down the hall.

And that's when I saw someone.

I saw a figure or something
come out of that room,

and I thought it was one of
you playing a joke on me,

but then I saw Andy
dead in the dark.

When I went in that room

there was blood all around
and not a soul in sight.

But then when I saw
that she wasn't, uh.

Why didn't you call for help?

Yeah, when I came in you
were just frozen there.

I was like in
shock or something.

Okay, I, I, I couldn't believe-

Let's just
pretend for a second

that every word of
your story is true,

so you heard noise,
was it like a crash or?

It was like a, a
stomp, or, or a thud,

or a bang or something.
Like a gun.

No, no, no, it
was, uh, a loud,

look storytime is
over, all right.

Don't we need to be
worried about the killer?

You know he's gotta
still be her somewhere.

Oh, god.

You think he's still here?

Then let's find him.

There's four of us, we have
lights, we have weapons,

let's find them.

What if we don't find anyone?

Then we'll know whose
story's true and whose wasn't.

Fine.

Let's go together.

I can show you.

Do you guys still
think someone's here?

Who did this?

If there's someone else
here show yourself!

Not gonna let you
get away with this!

What'd you do?

Did you take this hammer here
and throw it in her skull?

Is that what you did? Is
that what you did, huh?

[hammer whooshes]
[hammer thuds]

[metal clanging]

[gentle brooding music]

You okay, Ella?

[ominous music]

Let's go check out
that back entrance

where you came in, right?

Let's see that back door.

Has the light out here
been on all night?

Yeah.

It should be locked.

I locked it earlier.

I don't think there's
anyone back here.

I don't think there's
anyone here at all.

[suspenseful music]

[dial tone humming]

Phones are working fine.


The phones aren't out.

They're working fine.

Logan was freaking out.

[suspenseful music]

Logan, put the ax down, man.

Did you lie to us
about the phones?

No, no, I didn't kill her.

I didn't kill her, man, I
just found her like that.

I don't believe you.

I don't believe a
word you've said.

She took everything from me!

She took my family.

She took my friends.

Stay away from me!

Hey, calm down.

We can figure this out.

You made a mistake.

Stay away from me!

[Ella screams]

[door clicks]

[door clicks]

[arrow whooshes]

[Logan groans]
[wind blowing]

[Logan gasping]

[body thuds]

[Mia crying]

Let it go.

Put it down.

[Ella crying]

It's okay.

Calm down.

Oh, god.

[door bangs]

[Ella crying]

[footsteps crunching]

[Mia crying]

God, I'm so sorry.

I, I didn't mean to.

Logan, you made me do it, man.

What are we gonna do?

We gotta do something.

You think we should
wait until morning

for someone to come?

The phones are working, Blake,
we can call 911, that's it.

No, no.

I, I don't know, I mean
they're already dead.

They can't be rescued.

We can't call anyone.

No, we, we can't.

Mia, you gotta promise me.

What about her?

You don't think she's gonna

tell the police
everything that happened?

Logan admitted to killing her,

and I think she'll
do whatever we say

as, as long as she's
free from the blame.

So what do we tell the police?

We have to call them.

No, the police, no,
no, we can't tell anyone.

What?

We can bury this.

You and me, we can bury
their bodies both of 'em

and clean up this mess.

We can get out of here
before anyone comes.

No one needs to know
that we were here.

We can just say that,

I don't know that we went
to leave without them

'cause we couldn't find them

and just figured they meet us
later or something, I just-

My god, can I have
Blake back please?

What is wrong with you?

You just left from a trip
without your girlfriend

because you couldn't
get ahold of her.

No one has to know
she's my girlfriend.

That, that won't work, Blake.

It's not possible.

It will come back.

We have to call the police.

Hey, I am with you, okay?

[Ella whimpering]

[wind blowing]

I'm gonna tell police, Blake.

I'm gonna tell them how we
got stuck here together,

how you got us in
from the storm.

I'm gonna tell them how
there was someone else here.

They tried to kill us.

They got Andy first
and then Logan.

They went for the car,
and they saw the damage,

and they realized that
they were stuck here too.

We, we don't know who they
are, even what they look like.

All we know is that
they tried to kill us.

We're the victims here.

Logan, uh, went to dig
us out food from the car,

and someone shot him.

We're scared and
we wanna go home.

You kept us safe.

You stayed with the
girls, and protected us.

You're the hero,
Blake, the survivor.

But I shot him.

No, you didn't!

He got shot, not by you.

No, I don't know.

Nobody knows.

[dial tone humming]

[buttons beeping]
[Ella crying]

[phone ringing]

what's your emergency?

Hello?

[Ella gasps]

[wind blowing]

Okay, okay, we need
to get Ella on same page

and make our stories match,

then we'll be fine,
we'll be fine.

Oh, no.


[footsteps crunching]

The police are on their way.

What did you say?

What did you tell them?

Listen, it's okay,
I just need to know

what you said on the phone.

I told them that
we needed help.

That we got stuck
'cause of the snow,

and that two people are dead.

Did you say anything specific?

Anything remotely in detail?

No, I just told them
that we needed help.

Okay, listen, Ella,
when the police get here

we all need to say
the same thing, okay?

Do you understand me?

We all have to be
on the same page.

I'm sorry I shot Logan,
it was a mistake.

But I believe he killed her.

He killed his sister.

Who knows what he
would have done to us.

You saw how crazy he got.

She was his stepsister.

Exactly!

Stepsister he hated
and he said so.

When the police get here

we need to tell
them the same thing.

Okay, there, there was someone
here, they were after us.

They wanted to kill us.

[siren wailing]

They got Andy, they got Logan.

Can you do that for us?

You shot Logan, Blake.

You killed him.

No, stay away from me!

Stop!

Ella, I need you.

Stay away.
Mia and I both

need you, please.



[car door bangs]
[police radio chattering]


[car door bangs]

Ella, no one has to
take the blame for this.

No one.

Please.

Hey,

it's okay.

[police radio chattering]

Something's up.

Okay, we got it?

I just needed to hook
some cords up to the monitor

but this should have
full surveillance.

Did you play it yet?

No, wanted to wait till you-

Okay, we'll let's
go, let's play.

Let's roll it, roll footage.

I mean this could be everything.
[gentle melancholic music]

They're taking her now, look.

[police radio chattering]

[Detective Young]

Why can't we see anything?

The camera is
only set to record

when it senses movement.

Okay, well, it's
recording this,

what's moving in the dark?

There, someone's in the room.

Dammit there she is.

Is she trying to
get in the cabinets?

[electricity humming]

Uh, uh, where did it go?

What happened?

Did you turn it off?

[Mr. Nielsen] The
light turned off.

Uh, [sighs] can,
can you rewind that?

[recorder whirring]

[recorder clicks]

[gentle brooding music]

[electricity crackling]

[head thuds]

She just fell.

Okay, um, fast-forward
a little bit,

see if anybody else
comes in the room.

[recorder whirring]

Is there anything else?

[recorder clicks]

Whoa.

Uh, he's pretty intense, huh?

[recorder clicks]

the video from the room,

does that help you?

Well, it's interesting
to see the group,

and they all seem to be against
each other in that room,

and we know that poor Andrea
was in the room alone.

cameras do we have?

Here's the main hallway.

Hmm.

[keys clicking]

[ominous music]

Uh, yikes.

Well, that's not
good for their story.

So he killed his friend.

It looks that
way unfortunately.

On top of that I mean
they're all lying about it.

They don't know.

Know what?

That she fell.

Freak accident.

They blame Logan.

All right, I'm gonna need a copy

of that security tape, okay?

Let's go.

[group chattering]

Well, good news, we have
some footage, some video,

some cloud, whatever you guys
are calling it these days.

Is there any further
you wanna share with me?

Video?

Yeah.

It's a bird's eye
view of everything

that went on here last night,
it's called surveillance.

What's on the video?

Why don't you tell me?

We already did.

Did you see who shot Logan?

No.
Have you ever fired

a bow and arrow before?

No, sir.
Really?

Not even in phys ed?

I mean, I admit it does
seem weird for gym class

but it does beat
running the mile.

No, uh, archery at your school?

Are you okay?

Do you need a tissue?

No.

If you could blame someone
for last night who would it be?

[police radio chattering]

Me.

Now why would you say that?

We wouldn't even
be at this school

if I had just pulled
over earlier on the road.

I used to just think that
everything happened for a reason

but can't find a
reason for any of this.

I can't find the
reason either, Blake.

There's a lot of that
in my line of work.

You okay?

Do you think they
really have a video?

No.

I think he was just trying

to scare me into
saying something.

Do you really think
this is all your fault?

[gentle somber music]

[door bangs]

[car engine revving]

[car beeping]

[DVD clicks]
[DVD player whirring]

All right, we're all set.

Okay, now remember we both take
three paces, turn, and draw.

Now don't look at the camera
or you'll ruin the movie.


Boom, boom!
Bang!

I got you, I got you!
I got you first!

[Young Logan groans]

stop, that tickles.

Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

Bang.

[Young Logan groans]
[Young Blake laughs]

Okay, you're dead.

Cut!

[trunk whirring]
