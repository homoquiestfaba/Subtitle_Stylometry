I need to talk to that motherfucker!
You hear me?

I want to talk to that fucker right now!

I want that motherfucker!

<i>You find that bastard now,
or I am gonna...</i>

<i>I'm gonna shoot my whore wife,
and I'm gonna shoot the boy!</i>

Joe, just relax.

Relax. We're looking
for your wife's boyfriend,

<i>- and I'm gonna find him, all right?
You want to help me?</i>

<i>Which one do I shoot first? Do I shoot
the whore, or do I shoot the whore's boy?</i>

<i>Huh? You help me choose!</i>

No, no, Joe,
nobody wants to hear gunshots in there.

You scare us all out here.

Now look.
I've been trying to help you all day.

All right. You want me to help you,
you gotta help me.

<i>You don't know what it's like, man.</i>

<i>You do not know what it's like.</i>

<i>You do not know what I've been through.
You don't know what I'm going through.</i>

<i>You don't think I got the balls, do you?</i>

I know you got the balls, Joe.

<i>- No, you don't think I'm gonna do it.
Joe, you got the gun.</i>

You can do whatever you want.

<i>I feel so tired, man.
When in Christ am I gonna sleep?</i>

I know you're tired, Joe.
You've been up all night.

Come on. Let me come down there.

<i>- What do you say?
No! No, no!</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>

You all right?

I hate this fucking guy.

Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry.

We know the boy's in his room. If we move
now, we got a 100% chance of saving him.

We're giving up on the mom?
She's 20% at best.

Jeff, we gotta move on the boy.
It's the only choice.

This one's getting away from him.
Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here.

We've been here for 16 hours.
Fucking new guy.

Everybody calm down.
We're all tired.

I'd just steer Joe away from the subject
of choice. Choosing represents...

Tell me something I don't fucking know.

Wait, wait.

I hear crying.
The boy's awake.

We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom.

<i>Shut up, Sean. Shut up!</i>

Hey, Joe. It's me, Jeff. I'm back on.

Listen, let Sean's mom
take care of him, all right?

<i>He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.</i>

<i>He's probably hungry,
'cause he wakes up and he just whines...</i>

<i>- Tell you what. Let me do you a favor.
... till that bitch feeds him.</i>

Find out what Sean likes to eat,
and I'll send it in.

Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom
while me and you fix this thing.

<i>- What do you say?
Sean!</i>

<i>The cops want to know
what you want to eat, so get in here.</i>

<i>- The boy's moving from his bedroom.
Get in here!</i>

Our guys put him at 80%.

60.

30.

<i>Hello?</i>

Sean.

<i>Hey, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

<i>Son, I need you to move back
to your bedroom, OK? Right now.</i>

<i>- Mr. Talley?
Yes?</i>

Are you gonna save us?

Yeah, Sean. I'm gonna save you.

Now I know why you couldn't choose.

<i>It's because God
decided everything already.</i>

<i>Me and the whore are gonna go to hell.</i>

<i>- No, Joe. Just... Look, relax. Just relax.
But my boy's gonna go to heaven.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Jeff.</i>

<i>Joe, listen.</i>

Come on, Joe. Pick it up. Pick it up.

<i>- I hear ringing.
Pick it up.</i>

<i>- It's just ringing.
Pick it up, Joe.</i>

Jeff? He's saying something.

<i>- We got movement!
Fuck!</i>

<i>- Where's your shot?
We lost the shot.</i>

Where do you want it?
Side one, opening two.

<i>- I'll put him there.
O my God, at the end of this day,</i>

<i>I'm heartily thankful
for all the graces I've received.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry for all the sins
I've committed against you.</i>

<i>Please forgive me, O God.</i>

<i>And graciously protect me
at the end of this night.</i>

<i>Blessed Virgin Mary, my heavenly mother,
please take me under your protection.</i>

<i>Joe! Hey, it's me, Jeff...</i>

<i>And St. Joseph.</i>

I'm outside your house!

<i>Saints of God, please pray for me.</i>

Just come to the window
and talk to me! Come on!

<i>- Amen.
It's me, Jeff! Just come on!</i>

Joe, only God has the right to decide
who lives and who dies!

And he hasn't decided!

Joe! It doesn't have to end now!
I know you can hear me!

Joe, just come to the window
and talk to me!

Come on, pray with me.
I'll pray with you. Come on.

Come on. Just shoot me. Shoot me.

Come on, I'm right here. Just come to
the window. Come on, I know this prayer.

St. Joseph, dear God...

<i>Joe!</i>

Fuck.

Sean?

Sean?

Medic!

<i>Everybody stand down.
Get the EMTs.</i>

<i>'Cause it's not fair.
My life sucks since Dad moved up here.</i>

<i>We've all had
to make adjustments.</i>

It's just as hard on your father.

<i>Oh, bullshit, Mom. He loves it here.
He thinks Bristo Camino's nice.</i>

<i>Can we talk about this in the car?</i>

<i>No, Mom.
Why can't you tell him to come back to LA?</i>

<i>His job is here, Amanda.</i>

His home is here,
and when we visit, it's our home too.

<i>It's not my home
and it'll never be my home!</i>

Mom, don't you get it?
I fucking hate it here!

Don't swear, and keep your voice down.
What about me?

Bathroom's free.

<i>Why don't you guys
just get divorced?</i>

Freezie, come on.

It's OK. I'm not finished with it yet.

Sorry for all the shouting.

Well... She had to get me to hear her
somehow, didn't she?

This is getting really, really hard,
you know?

I just wish you would talk to me.

How am I not talking to you?
I'm talking to you right now.

It would be nice
to know what you're thinking.

I'm thinking
that I'm a half-hour late for work.

Well, at least explain again
to your daughter why you took this job.

See you next weekend.

Hey.

Look, I don't know
what pisses you off more.

Me or my Tater-Tot casserole.

Amanda.

Amanda.

<i>Aman...</i>

This yours?

Dennis.

Smooth.

Hey, that's, like, a $200 ticket.
Shut up.

You got $200? Huh?
Shut up, Kevin.

Green light.

<i>If you have four dollars, you can't
give him seven. So you have to borrow.</i>

<i>Yeah, but... so you're...
If you're studying borrowing,</i>

you have to know
exactly how much you're borrowing.

OK. Bye.

Can I go hang at the Plaza tonight?
The Plaza?

Yeah, just friends. It might be a movie.
Can we have Mr. Kim's tonight?

Can you wait?
Oh, Mr. Kim we have on speed dial.

I'm hungry.
I'm talking.

I'm ordering. Hello, yes. I wanted to
put in an order, please, to pick up.

<i>- What about homework?
Done.</i>

<i>Ha. I almost believe that.</i>

Yeah. We'd like to order...

Well, what would we like to order?

<i>Kev, do the Dew. In super size.</i>

<i>Hey, why do I always gotta go?</i>

If I'm buying, you're flying.
Get out of the truck.

You should listen to your brother.
Give me some money then.

It's in the box.

What's that for? Dennis?

Check the car. Check the car, Mars.

Hey, I know her.

I mean... I don't know her.
I've seen her around.

You know where she lives?
No.

Oh, you think it's funny?

Rich bitch driving in her daddy's Escalade.

Fuck you.

Hello, Louise.
Afternoon, Chief.

Who's in the field?

Ruiz and Kovaks are working
a TC over on Monte Verde.

Two units, one fender bender.
Hope she's 18.

Afternoon, Chief.
Bill.

Mikey. Very dynamic wheels.

Casual Monday?
Well, Chief, I...

How do you expect
to be taken seriously as a cop

if you're gonna wear
sneakers to work, kid?

I'm sorry, Chief. It won't happen again.
That's what you said on Casual Sunday.

It was the play-offs.
Yeah.

What do you say we rename today
"Low-crime Monday"?

Followed by what?
Low-crime Tuesday.

That's right.

Low-crime Tuesday.

<i>Yes, I would say
Brenda's looking very good.</i>

Fine. Couple of minutes.

Daddy?

Uh, can you give me just a second?
My son just walked in.

What's this attached to my ear?

A phone.
Why is it attached to my ear?

'Cause you're talking on it?
Which means you are...

Interrupting your conversation?
That's my genius.

OK, Mr. Genius. What I'd like is
all your homework done, on my desk,

before any more television. Sound good?

God...
I know.

How about getting
the doors there for me, champ?

Appreciate it. One, and then...
The other.

Yeah. Thanks, champ.

<i>OK. I am ready
to loan you Heaven Can Wait.</i>

What time would you like me to drop it?

OK.

Done.

I like it.

Let's just go to the movies.

We're gonna go to the movies.

<i>- But first we're gonna take daddy's car.
No, man.</i>

Dennis, this is way worse
than any shit you've done before.

Stay in the truck, OK?

Dad, you're such a dinosaur!

All right. All I'm saying
is that there are men out there.

Men. Not the boys I go to school with.

Right. Men. OK?

Men see this sort of outfit
as a sexual invitation. That's all I'm saying.

Looking for something?
Empty.

Ooh, how'd that happen?

Look, how's this?
If I change what I'm wearing,

will you give me $40 for tonight?
If that doesn't remind me of your mother.

How about you change
what you're wearing,

then we talk about the $40 afterwards, OK?

Hey. Hey.

Door.

Say it again, rich bitch. Huh?

Say "Fuck you".

Tommy?

Tommy, what...
Hey, don't move.

No. No.
Don't move, man.

What do you want?
Who else is in the house?

Nobody.

<i>Daddy!</i>

<i>- Tommy...
Where's mommy?</i>

Huh? Where's mommy?

<i>My wife's dead.</i>

Mars, the door.

You really should listen to your brother.

Shit!
What are you doing?

I told you to stay in the fucking truck.

Dennis, man, you can't do this.
I told you, don't use my fucking name.

Where are the keys?
Keys?

Where are the fucking car keys?
In my office.

Office. Go. Come on, let's go.

All right.
It's gonna be OK.

I like your shirt.

<i>By the way,
Carol's answering a silent alarm.</i>

Says there's a suspicious vehicle out front.

All right. Let's get her some backup.
See who's in the area.

Bristo 23 and 29er, 15 requesting backup.

<i>Ruiz, Kovaks, are you out there?</i>

<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

Louise, what's the address on that alarm?
I'm gonna go check it out myself.

Daddy, just give them the keys.
I'm gonna give them the keys, honey.

<i>I just need to be certain...</i>

What is that? What the fuck is that?
The front gate.

It's a cop. Dennis, it's a cop.
Shit!

<i>- It's OK. I know her. Just be cool.
Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

It's OK. I can just...
Shut the fuck up!

Calm down, OK? I can talk
to the police officer from here using that.

<i>I can tell her that everything's fine.
Then she'll go, and then you can go.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Afternoon. This is Officer Flores
with the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

<i>We're answering a silent alarm.
Is everything OK in there?</i>

<i>I'm sorry. We must have
accidentally tripped the alarm.</i>

I understand, sir.
These things happen all the time.

But there's an abandoned
pickup truck on your street.

Have you seen who it might belong to?

<i>Oh, no, it's not abandoned. There's
a guy here fixing the airconditioning.</i>

<i>I'm sure everything's OK.</i>

<i>Could you come outside, please?</i>

<i>- Say something.
Officer, my son's got a fever.</i>

<i>I've got the pediatrician on hold. Do you
really need me to come down there?</i>

<i>- 15, please respond.
Bristo base, this is 15. Come back.</i>

<i>Carol, be advised
there's a felony want on that red pickup.</i>

<i>The vehicle's suspected of being involved
in a carjacking last week in Valencia...</i>

Mars! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking shit!

<i>Shit!</i>

Code three!
I'm taking fire. I'm taking fire!

Get on the fucking couch!
I gotta fucking think, man.

Fuck! Shit.
Dennis, in my desk I have contacts

for lawyers and judges.

I can help you get out of this, Dennis.
Fuck! Don't say my fucking name!

<i>- No! No!
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!</i>

Stop it!

Daddy, no! Daddy, wake up!

Fuck you.

<i>Flores is down. Flores is down!</i>

Heads down, heads down.
I'm coming up to...

Hector, you all right?
Jesus!

Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

They ran your truck, dawg.
They know we've been jacking cars.

<i>- Shit.
Attention, you in the house.</i>

<i>This is Chief Talley
of the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

I'm gonna bring my car closer
so I can evacuate the injured officer.

I am not coming in the house.
I repeat: I am not coming in the house.

Do not shoot me.

<i>Do not shoot at me.</i>

Carol, come on. Give me your hand.

Hang on. Come on.

Come on.

Just hang on. Hang on.

<i>Hey.</i>

Pull yourself together.
Put this in the back of one of the cars.

Go on.

<i>ETA on the sheriff is 15 minutes.</i>

<i>Deputy in charge is Captain Shoemaker,
negotiator is Wil Bechler.</i>

<i>Thanks, Louise.</i>

Truck's registered
to a Mary Anne Kelly of Agua Dulce.

We're still trying to track her down.

But a neighbor told us she lives with
her two teenage boys, Dennis and Kevin.

And the neighbor also told us
that Dennis has some juvenile history.

<i>You're gonna go to jail.</i>

<i>- You're all gonna go to jail.
Enough!</i>

Why won't you just leave us alone?
Tie 'em up.

Tie 'em up with what?
I don't know. Just figure something out.

Tie 'em up. Go upstairs. Let's go.

I'm not leaving my father.

I'm gonna take care of him. I'm gonna get
some ice for his head, maybe a pillow.

It's OK.
Come on, let's go.

<i>Let's go.</i>

Yeah?

<i>Since you're answering the phone,
I'm going to assume this is Dennis.</i>

I'll take that as a yes.

This is Jeff Talley, Dennis.
I'm with the local police.

You the man in charge in there?

Yeah. I'm in charge.

<i>All right.</i>

Then you can tell me who shot my cop.

Was it you, or Kevin?
No... no, don't put that on us.

I want to talk to Mr. Smith for a minute.

<i>I want to hear from him
that everything's OK inside the house.</i>

Fuck you. I'm running this shit.

<i>- You talk to me.
That's right, Dennis.</i>

<i>You are running this shit.</i>

<i>Tell me you're the man in charge, that'll
be your responsibility. You understand?</i>

<i>Fuck you.
Don't try and play me.</i>

<i>You get us a helicopter
to fly us out of this shit.</i>

I'm just a local paper-pusher, Dennis.

<i>Get me a fucking helicopter
before I start shooting people.</i>

Be cool, Dennis. Be cool.

Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there.

You tell me you didn't shoot my cop?
All right. I believe you.

But nobody's gonna be able to help you
if you start hurting people in there.

<i>- You understand?
Just get me what I want.</i>

I'm not the guy, Dennis.
Then get me the guy!

<i>- Louise, come back.
Go, Chief.</i>

Confirmed the entire Smith family
is inside the house,

along with two suspects, possibly a third.

You want a hit?

OK.

Can't get out this way.
We can't get out this way, either.

Hey, Dennis. Dennis.
What?

Dennis.
What?

That cop... Mars just started shooting.

You know what, Kevin? Mars had a reason.

Had a reason?
Yeah.

Dennis, you've known that guy,
like, three weeks, and he just shot a cop.

Whose fault
do you think that was, Kevin? Huh?

He shot a cop.
Huh?

Maybe you should've stayed in the truck.
If you'd listened, you could've warned us.

You could've lied to the cop. Done
something other than fucking this shit up.

There's no way out up here.

<i>Hey, you guys
gotta come see this shit.</i>

Kitchen. Driveway.

And office right there.

Holy shit.

<i>...apparently
a hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

<i>We have no further information,
other than the pictures that you see here.</i>

Fuckin' rich people.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

This is bad. No, this is bad!

Fuckin' rich people.

<i>Put it back.</i>

Claustrophobic?
Try fuckedophobic.

Mars. Mars, Kevin.

Fucking check this out.

<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith. You've reached
my voice mail. Please leave a message.</i>

We have a problem.
I can't get to the accountant.

I know. I'm watching it on TV.

We must get control of this situation.
We have nine hours until the hand-off.

<i>Bristo Camino
has a very small police department,</i>

<i>so we have requested the assistance
of Ventura County Sheriff's Department,</i>

<i>who will be here shortly.</i>

<i>Chief, we understand the dead officer...</i>

Would you stop it?
We need to help Daddy.

Shut up. Watch the TV.
That's the police, OK? They're gonna help.

We gotta cut the tape.
Shut up.

Roll together, OK? Off the bed. Then, like,
maybe we can get what's under the bed.

Under my bed? What's under my bed?
Your bong. We can break it.

What? You've been sneaking in my room?

Come on, hurry. Faster. You gotta do it.
I'm trying.

<i>Wait, shh.</i>

<i>Christ. What are you guys doing?
You didn't hear that?</i>

All right, come on. Fight with me now.

<i>- Stop screaming, you little gerbil...
Help! Help!</i>

Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.
Are you kidding me?

The kid... Cut him, yeah. Cut him.
The kid weighs, like, 30 pounds.

Are you kidding me? Tie him up, OK?
Tie him up in his own room.

Please try doing it right, OK?
Please do it right.

You get the girl.
It'll be OK!

Do it right without dickin' it up.

What about my brother?

Don't worry about him.

You cold?

No.

I'm Marshall.

What's your name?

Jennifer.

Please.

Please.

<i>...the situation is undercontrol...</i>

"Jeff Talley, Chief of Police".

Asked for the helicopter yet?
Right from the jump.

Might want to get a minister
or a priest up here.

Like riding a bike, isn't it?

Want to talk to him?
Robby!

Got me that dedicated line yet?

You miss LA?

<i>Five minutes,
scout team, five minutes.</i>

Speed dial one?
Yeah.

<i>- Yeah?
Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

I'm gonna introduce you to Wil Bechler
from the Sheriff's Department.

Are you ready to talk to him?

<i>Is he the guy?</i>

Yeah, Dennis. This is the guy.

Hang on.

Good luck. I'll see you around.

Captain Shoemaker? Captain?

Thank you for coming up.
Thanks, Jeff.

Anything you need, give me a call.
Got it.

<i>...apparent hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

<i>Well, Jim, details are still a bit incomplete
right now, but here's what we know so far.</i>

<i>Earlier today, a police officer
was shot and killed while in...</i>

Hey. How you doing? It's me.

You guys almost home?

<i>Actually, we're still at your place.</i>

After you left, Amanda and I,
we had another fight.

<i>She turned on the TV.
We've been watching it all.</i>

<i>Well...</i>

I turned it over to County,
so I'm not there anymore.

Look, I know you're busy,
but can you stop by for a little bit?

I think I can, yeah.

I have to go by Carol's.

She had a kid.

<i>It's not your fault she's dead, Jeff.</i>

<i>You know?</i>

<i>It's not your fault.</i>

Yeah.

<i>- So, what was the argument about?
Oh, you know. What it's always about.</i>

She's afraid we're gonna get divorced.

<i>What do you think, Jane?</i>

<i>You think we're gonna get divorced?</i>

<i>- No.
Good. Me neither.</i>

<i>- So, I'll see you in a minute.
OK.</i>

<i>- Say hi to Amanda.
I will.</i>

<i>- OK.
I love you.</i>

Whoo!

<i>Drive.</i>

I know you're scared, but as long as
you don't do anything stupid,

we're not gonna hurt you.
Do you understand?

What do you want?

I want you to put your hands
on the roof of the car.

Pardon me.

Now, would you mind putting your left
hand through the steering wheel, please?

Now bring me the right.

Good.

Good.

Now the guy behind you
is gonna take hold of you.

Don't struggle. It's for your own good.
Please.

Eyes in the rearview mirror. Now.

<i>- Daddy!
Jane! Amanda!</i>

I know. I know, I know.

But at least they're still alive.

From this point on,
you control what happens to them.

Can we let you go?

Can you be calm?

Good. Good.

Now, listen to me. I want you
to go back to Walter Smith's house.

There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's
house that belongs to me.

I'm no longer in command.

You are going to reassume command
until my people arrive to finish the job.

You're not gonna let anyone
go into the house or anything come out.

Are you with me so far?

How am I gonna do that?

You... are the famous Jeff Talley.

Ten years SWAT,
seven years prime hostage negotiator.

You'll figure it out.

When this white phone rings,
it'll be me with further instructions.

If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

I will kill your wife.

And then I will kill your child.

But when I have what I want,
you get your family back.

Here.

Now, you wait until our van is gone
before you uncuff yourself.

Let's bring this home, Talley.

<i>- Yeah?
We have a boy on the line.</i>

<i>And he says he's Tommy Smith.</i>

I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

but he says he saw you on TV
and he wants to speak with you.

<i>- All right, Louise. Put him on.
Hold on.</i>

<i>- You're the man on TV?
Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV.</i>

<i>The guy called Dennis hit my dad,
and now he's...</i>

Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down, Tommy. Slow down.

<i>I'm really, really scared,
and you gotta help us.</i>

Slow down and take it easy.

Was your dad shot?

<i>Dennis hit him
a bunch of times with his gun.</i>

<i>- He hit my dad.
Tommy. Tommy. Tommy!</i>

<i>- He needs a doctor.
Try and talk quietly, OK?</i>

<i>- Just take it easy.
OK.</i>

All right.
Are you in a safe place?

<i>I'm in my bedroom.
They think I'm tied up, but I got free.</i>

Wait, Tommy.
How do you know they can't hear you?

<i>'Cause I can see them
on the security channel.</i>

<i>Tell me everything you can see on the TV.</i>

I see Dennis.

I see Kevin.

I see trees.

<i>I see army men.</i>

I see... the Mars guy...

<i>Wait, Tommy.</i>

Tell me about Mars.

Captain Shoemaker?
Get me an aerial shot ASAP.

This is Shoemaker.

<i>They're watching you
on the outside cameras.</i>

<i>Chief Talley?</i>

The suspects inside the house
are watching you.

<i>- They're watching every move you make.
Where did you get this information?</i>

If I were you I'd be thinking about
what to do with that information.

Mikey. Yeah, it's me. Listen to me.

Yeah, Chief.

Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions.

<i>Louise? Louise, come back.</i>

<i>- Come on, Louise. Where's that patch?
I'm locked out.</i>

It's a dedicated line, Chief.
They won't let me cut in.

What about Walter Smith's cell phone?
Did you get that?

<i>Uh... yes. Yes, I got it.</i>

<i>- OK, go.
It's 805-459...</i>

Dennis, you know what I'm hearing?
I'm hearing your dad's a real son of a bitch.

<i>No, we're fucking done, OK?</i>

All I want is my fucking helicopter
to fly me the fuck out of here.

You got that, fuckhead?

<i>Dennis, listen. I...</i>

<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith.
You've reached my voice mail.</i>

<i>- Shit.
Please leave a message.</i>

Come on, Dennis. Pick it up. Come on.

He keeps ringing.

<i>- Hello?
Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

Listen to me. Watch the security channel.

<i>Dennis, can you hear me?</i>

Yeah. I don't really know
what you're talking about.

<i>The hell you don't!
Shut up and listen to me!</i>

<i>Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.</i>

<i>- Yeah, what am I supposed to be seeing?
Shut up!</i>
