<i>This morning...</i>

<i>...I found a feather in the gutter.</i>

<i>It was worn.</i>
<i>It was tattered, seemingly worthless.</i>

<i>But I thought to myself...</i>

<i>...on the wing of an eagle,</i>

<i>a feather like this can soar</i>
<i>high above the trees,</i>

<i>over snow-capped mountains,</i>
<i>rushing rivers.</i>

I don't get it, man.

You know, everyone runs around,
looking for things they don't have.

Most times, it's...

It's right in front of their eyes.

See now...

Now, take this for example, right?

Don't mind if I do.

Now, look at this now.

<i>In Shakespeare's hand,</i>
<i>a feather dipped in a bit of ink</i>

<i>gave us the world's</i>
<i>most beautiful, wonderful stories.</i>

Now see, who'd throw
something this awesome away?

Not you or me.

Not enough comfort in the world
as it is if you ask me.

What else have we got in here?

What are you doing?

I was just minding
my own business, Officer.

<i>A paint brush in my hands might be good</i>
<i>for painting the house,</i>

<i>but a paint brush</i>
<i>in Michelangelo's hands...</i>

All right.
<i>- ...the Sistine Chapel.</i>

Have some breakfast, friend. Here.

Do me a favor.
Yes, sir?

Stay out of trouble, all right?

I don't want to have to haul you in again.

Anything you say, sir.

Thank you.
Okay.

<i>Hand me a violin...</i>
<i>Friends, you would run for the hills.</i>

<i>But a violin in the hands</i>
<i>of Itzhak Perlman, priceless.</i>

Got by that time.

<i>Two fish and five loaves in my hands,</i>
<i>not very much.</i>

Two fish and five loaves
in the Lord's hands can feed thousands.

Friends, things and people
only take on their full value

when they are placed in the right hands.

Are you willing to give your life to God

so that he can use you for his purpose?

The Bible tells us he took the five loaves
and the two fish.

He looked up to heaven,
and he gave thanks.

He blessed the food, he broke the loaves,

he gave them to his disciples
to set before them,

and the two fish,
he divided among them all.

It was a miracle that day.

Friends, all is made good through God.

You can choose to live your life
on your own,

never asking for help,
never asking for guidance.

Or you can give your life to God

and discover all the wondrous things
that he has planned for you...

...all the wonderful things he has planned

for each and every one of you.

Can I get an "amen"?

Yes!
Amen!

Don't be so obvious.

Thank you for coming.

Thank you so much.

Hey, hey, thank you, Meredith.
Thanks, Reverend.

Meredith, thank you.

Hi. Hi, Lori.
Thank you for coming.

Tim, good to see you.
Keep coming back.

Hey, kids! You too busy
to talk to your dad?

Great sermon, Dad.

Thank you. Did you really like it?

Because I think that
I touched the congregation today

on many different levels.

I wasn't really listening.

Well, please, tell me
that you got something out of my sermon.

I'm hungry. Does that count?

I was thinking fish tacos.

Look, I was thinking that we could spend
this afternoon as a family.

We can go to the movies.
Maybe go to the museum.

Well, actually, Peter's got

some video game convention thing
that he's going to,

and Chrissy's working pet adoptions down
at the animal shelter.

You know, I worry
about that kid sometimes.

She's got such a tough exterior, you know,

but I know she's falling in love with
each and every one of those rescue dogs.

Sweetheart, I...
I know.

I'm sorry.

I got a mani-pedi appointment.
Then I'm getting my roots done.

I'll see you later.
Okay, honey.

Brian Johnson wants to see you
in his office.

Thank you.

Closing?

There simply aren't enough members
to sustain this parish any longer.

The neighborhood? Mostly businesses.

The families have all moved out.

Now, you've done an admirable job

holding this church together
with such limited resources, but...

Look, I know, okay?

We didn't get enough funds
to get a new roof,

but that's no reason to close the church.

The building is falling apart around you.

The congregation will be invited
to join the church at Saint Mark's.

You're being reassigned.

Eufala.
Yes, I follow.

No, no, no, no.

That is the name of the town.

Arizona.

Eufala, Arizona.

I want to talk to you about...

...an opportunity.

Now, just hear me out
before you say anything,

because this is not something
that I sought out,

but it is... something
that I think that we should consider.

Just tell her what's in your heart.

She's stood behind your decisions
in the past, hasn't she?

She's got your back, man.

I'm sorry.

Have I seen you before?

Me? Well...

Me, I've always been here.

And you just haven't noticed.

I don't mind.

And you have an opinion
that you want to share with me.

Now, the way I see it...

Now, if you truly believe in something,

trust in that with all your soul.

Well, with all due respect, Mister...

DeAngelis.

Hi.
Rain DeAngelis.

You know, like the cleansing drops
that fall from the heavens.

Mr. DeAngelis, with all due respect,

you couldn't possibly know

what I'm going to have
to go through right now.

Now, you've got to convince your family
to do something,

something you haven't quite
convinced yourself about,

even though you know in your heart
it's the right thing to do.

You know how they say
when God closes a door,

he opens a window?
Yeah.

Well, you could just wait
for that window to open,

or you could...

So you're saying that
this could be God's plan for my family?

All I'm saying is,
you could just open the door.

That's how doors work.

Thanks.

Hi, Chrissy.
Hi, Dad.

<i>What if I don't want to go to Eufala?</i>

<i>What then?</i>

So there's this new game
called <i>Cliff Hanger,</i> and it's super...

Well, that's interesting, honey.

Mom, it's more than just interesting.

It's like the coolest game ever.

I mean, you get to climb
all the highest mountains in the world,

like Half Dome, Mount Whitney,
Kilimanjaro...

Kilimanjaro?

Honey, I don't know if I want
you doing something so dangerous.

Well, after each mountain,
you gain new skills for the next climb.

Well... you know,
it sounds very dangerous.

I think you should talk
to your father about it.

It's not like
he's actually going outside or anything.

Okay, who's talking to...

What the... What...

What the heck is that?

This is Yoda.

I think it's a gremlin.

What is it doing here?

She was the only one not adopted today.

I can see why.
Mom!

I couldn't bear the thought
of her going to the shelter alone.

I think she's great. Can we keep her, Mom?

Absolutely not.
You know this building doesn't allow pets.

Come on.

Little boo boo.

Okay, maybe one night.

Tomorrow you're going
back to the shelter.

And she's staying in your room.
Your father can't know about this, okay?

Okay.
Mary Louise.

Hiya, honey.
Hey, sweetheart.

Hi.
I gotta talk to you.

Can it wait?

Just...

There's... this church,

and the pastor just retired.

And I've been assigned
to help them find a permanent replacement.

And it's just something
I feel that I have to do...

...that we have to do,

and I don't think there's a lot of choice.

Well, there is a choice.

Joey has been after you for years
to come work at the restaurant.

Mary Louise, I have a calling, all right?

And your brother
and I don't exactly get along.

Nonsense.

I mean, this is perfect, really.

I mean, now you can finally be part
of the family business.

And then on the weekends,
you can do God's work.

I mean, it's win-win, honey.

At least promise me you'll think about it.

I mean, you know how much we love it here.

All right, honey, I'll think about it.

Thank you.
But on one condition.

If it doesn't work out, we go.
No complaints.

Okay.

Where is this place, anyway?

Eufala.

What, we can't go with you?
Eufala, Arizona.

Breakfast is served.

For our vegan option, we've got lentils
with broccoli, kale, and... tofu.

Very, very delicious.

Our protein breakfast
for you, young man,

egg white frittata in a tomato sauce.

Gluten free. Not too bad
if I do say so myself.

You kids are taking that dog
back to the shelter this morning, right?

Yeah.

Good, 'cause we can't have your father
worrying about anything else today, okay?

Well, we can't have Yoda going back
on an empty stomach, can we?

Thanks, Mom.
Enjoy. Bon appÃ©tit.

All right, honey.

Honey, I made you
this lean, mean, delicious green shake.

Come try it.
It's filled with antioxidants.

That's so nice, sweetheart,

but I'm gonna catch something on the way,
because I'm late.

I'm going to give it the old college try
with the pizza pie. Love you.

All right. Well...

Maybe we'll try something else.

How many times I gotta tell you, Joe?

Enough with that darn bell.
You don't have to ring it so many times.

You don't have to yell on top of it, okay?
I can hear you.

It's not going to make me move any faster.

Yeah, like anything
could make you move quicker.

I heard that.

There he is!

Hey, everybody, listen up.

This here is my brother-in-law, Randy.

I knew you'd come around eventually.
Yeah.

It took Mary Louise
longer than we thought, huh?

Longer than any of us thought, really.

Yeah. Welcome
to our humble establishment, Reverend.

Let me get you an apron
and get you all set up.

Okay. Thanks, Tina.

This was a mistake.

Geez. What now?

We're closed!

Joey, just... Can I speak to him?

Don't go all soft on me.

Hey. What are you doing here?

What are you thinking, man?

This isn't what
you're supposed to be doing.

Now... you know that, right?

I don't know anymore.

Yes, Randy, yes, you do.

It's just a different question this time.

Doesn't change the answer.

Wait. Wait.

Let me get you something, okay?

Joey, can I have a couple slices
for this gentleman, please?

Here.

False alarm.

Where are you going?
Out.

I told you. You never listen.

Me and your sister are going
to a book signing at the library.

The library?

So, you survive your first day?

Yeah, Tina, thank you. Thank you.

I really don't think
I would have made it without you.

Floor ain't going to mop itself, Reverend.

Joey.

Get to work.
Okay, brother-in-law of mine.

Hey, Tina. Hey, honey.

Honey!
How's it going?

Joey work you too hard?
Whatever.

Come on. We're going to be late.
Okay. Okay.

Listen, there's a plate in the fridge.
All you gotta do is heat it up, okay?

I'll see you later.

What? You forget something?

No. Look at him.

He's miserable.

Be honest with me.

Am I being selfish?

Making him do this so that we can stay?
Here's what I think.

You love someone,
you want them to be happy, right?

Yeah.

Even if that means
maybe doing something you don't wanna?

Yeah.
Okay, look.

You think being a waitress

in a pizza joint in Los Angeles
was what I wanted?

No?
No!

I had dreams, you know?

I really wanted to be somebody...

...like a dental hygienist.

Then I fell in love
with that big galoot brother of yours.

He wanted
to take over the family business,

and here we are.

So, you're saying
I should go with him?

I'm saying that if you really love him,

you should give what he wants a try.

He did come out here for me.

Return the favor...
and look good doing it.

Come on. We're going home.

What about the library?
What about the floor?

Go ahead. Get out of here.

You know I love you guys.
I love your pizza even more.

Honey, you're miserable.

I see it.

But you tried for me,
and I love you for that. I really do.

But this isn't what
you're supposed to be doing.

You're supposed
to be spreading the gospel...

...not garlic and prosciutto.

Healing souls, not tossing dough.

I want what you want,
and if what you want is in Arizona...

Arizona?

...then your family is going with you
to Arizona.

I love you. I really love you.
Come on.

You think it's romantic,
some girl does what her husband wants,

even when she don't wanna do it?

Yeah, I think that's romantic,
you sorry Neanderthal.

Me too, I guess.

Let me guess. You're getting a divorce.

No, honey. Never.

Is somebody dying?
No, nobody's dying.

No, it's nothing like that.

We are moving to Arizona temporarily.

What about school?
Yeah, all our friends are here.

Well, there are schools in Arizona.
You can make new friends.

Your mother and I realize
that this is a lot to ask of you,

but there's a church that needs
a helping hand down there,

and your father has been asked to go.

This is very important to your father.

We need to support his decision.

The animal shelter counts on me here.
This isn't fair.

Chrissy. Wait. Wait. Wait.

Chrissy.

It's breaking my heart
to even ask you this,

but you have to have some faith.

You have to trust your old man.

I can't believe you're making us leave.

I make a real difference here.

Can't I stay
with Uncle Joey and Aunt Tina?

Sweetheart, you are so special.

You will make a difference
no matter where you are.

I get my own bathroom, right?

I mean, no more sharing
with the bathroom hog.

That's a deal.
Deal.

I drive a hard bargain, huh?

Yes, you do. A very hard bargain.

But I kind of feel like I got off easy.

I thought you were going to ask
for something like your own car.

Was that on the table?
Absolutely not.

What about a new dog?
What do you mean?

Deal or no deal?

Chrissy!

Deal.

You do drive a very hard bargain.

Thanks.

I love you.
I love you too.

Watch the light, honey.

I never thought I'd be this sad
to leave this place.

Come here.

We're really gonna miss you guys.

Us too.

Who knows?
Maybe we'll show up in Eufala someday.

Word is they could use
some decent pizza in Arizona.

Is that the word?
Yeah.

<i>Just because we're on the road</i>
<i>doesn't mean you can't study.</i>

A Hundred Fun Facts about Arizona?
<i>You're kidding, right?</i>

<i>There'll be a quiz in an hour.</i>

<i>Wow. That's a lot smaller than I thought.</i>

<i>How is that even a town?</i>

<i>Welcome to Eufala, kids.</i>

Well, this is it.

Speak now, honey,
or forever hold your peace.

You know me.

When I commit to something,
it's all the way, honey.

You sure?

Being a pastor's wife means
going wherever the pastor is needed.

I love you.

Come on, kids. Welcome to the country.

Come on.

Darling.
Thank you.

Someone has got a sense of humor.

Or wants their husband
out of the house more often.

Exactly.

Hey.
Hi.

Hi.
I'm...

Sir, I know who you are.

Eufala isn't exactly the kind of place
people just wander upon.

I'm Alex Hutchins.

I'm Randolph,
otherwise known as Pastor Randy.

This is my beautiful wife, Mary Louise.

Hi.
Hi.

And this is my daughter, Chrissy.

Hey, you two are
about the same age, huh?

And this is...

That's Yoda. That's the cute sister.

This is my son, Peter.

Gosh, you're pretty.
Hey, be a gentleman.

We'll see you kids inside, huh?
All right. Bye.

I love the whole

I-just-fell-asleep-in-the-car look
you got going on.

Not many girls can pull that off.

You know, my mom, Reva,

she owns the best beauty shop
in all of Eufala.

You should really come by
once you get settled.

And I'm guessing you mean
the only beauty shop in Eufala.

Why aren't you inside with the others?
Animal abusers not allowed in?

My mom is also church secretary,

so naturally,
she has to be here on Sundays.

Come on. I'll show you around.

Coming?

And your little dog, too.

You have to go into town for a signal.

God, where are we?
Eufala.

You know, my uncle, Danny,
he's the youth group leader at church.

I can introduce you to him.

Meet you inside.
Okay.

Mabel, it's okay now. Just sit a spell.

Take a deep breath.
Ain't none of us going anywhere.

All right? Take a deep breath.

There you go.

Hi.

<i>You are the one</i>

As church secretary,
everyone's going to expect for me

to introduce you to them personally.

I know that they look meaner
than a bunch of rattle snakes,

but they don't bite.

At least not during the daytime.

Mary Louise, I know that you and I are
going to be the best of friends.

Nobody else in this town has
any real... style,

not like you and me.

Now, Jimmy Watkins, I swear

sometimes you have more moving hands
than a watch factory.

Well, as long as you have time for me.

Kids, I think I saw
some cookies on the table.

Why don't you go get something to eat?
Go on. Go.

Just quit horsing around.

We are trying to make a good impression
on our new pastor.

Pleasure to meet you, Pastor.

Pastor Randy.
Pastor Randy.

Mary Louise.
Mary Louise. Pleasure to meet you.

Well, I just want to apologize
for that public display of affection.

But as you can probably tell,
this here filly,

she's prettier than a hot glob of butter
melting on a pancake.

Of course, I probably
don't have to tell you that, do I, Pastor?

Would you just go away?

There's a whole church full of people
waiting to meet these fine folks.

All right. Well, welcome to Eufala.

Pleasure.
Thank you.

So who's responsible for that
very humorous sign that's out front?

Yeah. It's funny.
That's Danny's job.

Poor boy's only got one oar
in the water most times,

but he is such a cutup.

Sometimes I wish I were funny,

I mean, instead of pretty.

Now where was I?

That is the Widow Smythe.

She's kind of a celebrity here in Eufala.

She was in some movie with Elvis
back in the day.

<i>- Girls! Girls! Girls!</i> I think it was.
That's impressive.

It's hard to imagine
her ever being a movie star.

And poor thing, she's been in love
with Pastor Zeke for going on 40 years.

That's a long time.
Long time.

It's a very long time.
Yeah.

Well, she's a tough one.

She could start an argument
in an empty house.

I'm having a hard time...
What does that mean?

It means she's going
to be your toughest critic.

Well, thanks for the warning,

but Mary Louise and I,

we're pretty good
at winning people over, so...

In fact, why don't we go take a shot
at that right now, honey?

Yes. Let's go say hi.
Thank you.

Well, good luck.

Hi, baby.
Hey.

Hi, baby.
Hey, baby.

How are ya?

I'm cool.
I missed you.

Mrs. Smythe?

You must recognize me
from my movies, am I right?

No, I...

...was actually just saying
you look so familiar.

<i>Girls! Girls! Girls!,</i> am I right?

So, tell me why it is
you think you should be our new pastor.

Mrs. Smythe, we just got done with this...

Really again?

Mrs. Smythe, it is
a pleasure to meet you.

I am just looking so forward
to meeting all of the residents of Eufala.

Not that many worth knowing
if you ask my opinion.

Especially not that one.

I mean, just look how she dresses.

And for church no less.

It's like soup on a plate.
It's just not right.

Right... Zeke!
What?

If brains were leather,

that girl wouldn't have enough
to saddle a June bug.

Whatever you say, Ethel.

Hi.
Pastor Ezekiel?

You cycle?
Sorry?

What, are your ears flopping over?

Do you cycle, cycle, cycle?
Do you ride a bicycle?

Yes, yes, actually, all the time.
Yes, sir.

Good. I do my best thinking on a bike.

Twenty miles. Tomorrow 6:00 a.m.
Don't be late.

I hope you are in good shape.

Zeke is quite an athlete.

Don't judge a book by its cover.

Where's your Bible?

I don't trust a pastor

who doesn't carry the good book
with him at all times.

Well, actually, I happen to have it
downloaded right here on this tablet.

It's very convenient to keep the good book
with me at all times.

The Bible wasn't meant to be convenient.

Any minister worth his salt
should carry the actual weight of the book

to remind him of the import of the words
that he has been entrusted to share.

Well, if that's the case,
then I guess any minister worth his salt

would carry around stone tablets
as Moses received on the mount.

Well played, young man.

Well played.

Don't be late.
I won't.

I think I've had enough
of meeting people today.

Yeah, me too.
Okay. Shall we...

What do you say
we go find ourselves a place to live?

I think it's a great idea.
Okay.

Well, Mary Louise, what do you think?

Interesting, huh?
Yeah, very.

Where's our car?

Where is our car?

Mary Louise, the U-Haul...
Everything is gone!

Never should've left LA.

Officer. Officer.

There's been a robbery.

Are you sure? There haven't been
any robberies in Eufala...

There was that one time
when you got called in to investigate

when Mrs. van der Gelder's
billy goat went missing.

Right, turns out
he just wandered next door

to spend some time with Mabel's doe.

And Rascal Johnson thought
that his truck was stolen

a while back, remember that?
Found it a few days later

right where he left it,
behind Billy Jean's cafe.

I'm sorry.
We're losing precious time here.

We're not talking about
Mrs. van der Gelder's love-struck goat

or Rascal Johnson's long lost truck.

We're talking about everything
we own in the world.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

My family loses everything,
and the best they can do is laugh.

Mary Louise, we're going back
to the city where it's safe.

In what car?
Now hold on there, Padre.

I'll give you a ride.

I promise we'll find your stuff.

Coming?
Yeah.

So, how do you all like Eufala?

Well, we've only been here
a couple of hours,

and we don't have a place to live,
and all our stuff has been stolen,

but other than that, it's great.

I'm sorry. Is something funny?
No.

Actually, our impression of Eufala
is less than dandy at the moment.

Dad.
No, no, not now, Peter.

And frankly, I would expect
more out of you, Officer,

even if you're not used
to bad things happening

in your little town.

No, Dad,
you should really look out the window.

Chrissy, just give me a minute, all right?

Randy.
What?

It seems we've gotten off
like a herd of turtles, Padre.

This is the house the church provides
for the pastor.

It's yours for as long as you're here.

And that is Eufala helping you move in.

Why don't you guys go check it out?

Dibs on the biggest bathroom.

What are you waiting for?

Let's go see our new home.

What is going on?

They're unloading our stuff, honey.

Welcome to the country, family.

This is amazing.

<i>Set this up</i>
<i>like it's your own kitchen, girls.</i>

Everything convenient
and organized, all right?

Tell me why we have to do this.

I mean, they're only here for six months.

Then we have to do this all over again
for the next pastor and his family.

Well, that's not
how we do things in Eufala, now is it?

We never know how long
someone is going to be in our lives,

so we welcome them
as though it's going to be forever.

You know how these city people are.

I mean, I bet you anything
she doesn't even know how to cook.

They probably go out and eat all the time

and never eat at home
like a family should.

Have you seen the way she dresses?

Way too fancy for a preacher's wife.

There's nothing wrong
with wanting to look your best.

You know, it must be scary

moving to a new town
and meeting new folks.

What is this?
It's a juicer.

You know, for those rare occasions
where we don't go out to eat.

I actually like to use
organic fresh fruits and vegetables,

you know, like kale,
wheat germ, strawberries.

We are so happy your family is
here in Eufala, aren't we, ladies?

What smells so delicious?

Mary Louise, you simply haven't lived

until you've tried Lila's
country fried steak and sweet potato pie.

Honey, do you need to step outside
and get some air?

I think so.

Hey, you all right, honey?

Yeah, yeah, I'm just not used
to eating any stuff like that.

You know, all those carbs.

Well, I do suppose that Southern cooking
can take some getting used to.

Yeah.

Say, is everyone in Eufala
always this nice and helpful?

Well, I mean, I guess we have our share
of good old boys

who break bad every now and again,
but for the most part, yeah.

We just tend to take care of each other.

Just being neighborly,
I guess you could say.

Yeah, I didn't know
any of my neighbors back in the city.

Well, I guess that it can take some time
to get to know your neighbors.

We were there for years.

That's Norma Nichols,
editor of the <i>Eufala Tattler.</i>

Look at her.

Madder than a mule chewing
on bumble bees.

Bumble bees?
Norma doesn't care for me much.

She fancies Officer Barney.

She thinks that... It's so silly.
...I flirt with him.

Well, you kind of do.

Please. As if any guy who liked...
this would go for her.

Reva.
Norma.

Good afternoon, ladies.
Hi, I'm Norma Nichols,

editor of the <i>Eufala Tattler.</i>
Now I assume you're...

Mary Louise. It's a pleasure.

Pastor Ezekiel retiring after 50 years
is a big change for the people of Eufala.

I'd like to do a cover story
on your family.

Introduce yourselves,

help the community get
to know their new guests.

All right, I'll go get my husband.

Bless your heart.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Mary Louise, a word please.

You see, that doesn't really mean
what you think it does.

What Reva really means is
that was just a silly statement,

but you're just not self-aware enough
to know it.

Mary Louise, it's you I want to interview.

Good gracious, Norma,
our guests just got here.

Maybe your little interview
will have to wait.

Very well then. Good day.

Why don't you come back tomorrow?

I'm sure that Mary Louise will be happy
to answer all your questions then.

Little bit intense.

Yeah. Sometimes that girl
just dills my pickle.

But... Norma's all right, I suppose.

I mean, she just needs
to loosen up a little bit.

I tell you, the only reason that I flirt
with Officer Barney at all

is to get Norma's goat.

I got my eyes on Jimmy Watkins.

Okay.

Forget how good fresh air tasted.

So...

...you think this might be
a good move for us?

Well, this is your calling, right?

Not Arizona. I mean the ministry.

When I was a kid,
I didn't want to go to church.

My parents made me go.

All the other kids would be
playing football in the street.

I was jealous. I didn't think it was fair.

My mother said, "It doesn't matter
if it's fair. It's right."

But I was grateful to her
after I heard the story of Samuel,

that even small children
could hear the voice of God.

And I so wanted God to speak to me.

But no matter how still it was at night,

or how quiet I was in the back of the bus,

I couldn't hear anything.

So, I started to think
that maybe I was unworthy,

or that God spoke
to other people and not me.

Then my mother told me,
"You know what, Randal?

"You're doing it wrong.

You don't listen for God with your ears.
You listen with your heart."

And that's when everything changed for me.

That's when I heard his voice.

And now, I think I can hear him saying

that this might be
the right place for us for a while.

Maybe it's not so bad,
us being here for a while, huh, kids?

What do you think?
I can make it work.

Yeah?
It's cool.

I mean, I don't gotta share
a bathroom anymore with... her.

Yeah, it wasn't a walk
in the park for me either.

What about you, Chrissy?
Six months?

Yeah, it'll be okay.

What do you say, girl?

Yoda is in, too.

All right then.
All right then.

It's settled. We're staying.

Only for six months, though.

Hey.
Hey.

Where you going?

I'm going bike riding
with Pastor Ezekiel, remember?

Honey, do you think
that's such a good idea?

Well, it's a chance for me
to get to know Pastor Ezekiel.

Find out more about the congregation,

what they're looking for
in the line of a new minister.

Besides, the sooner
I find a new minister...

The sooner we get
to go back to Los Angeles.

Bingo.
Okay.

Besides, what could go wrong?

I don't know, but just be careful.
You haven't been on a bike in a long time.

Please, honey,
the guy is like 90 years old.

I think I'm going to make it.

There is one problem.
You don't really have a bike.

There is that.

Gonna use Pete's 12-speed.

Uncle Joey took that.

Your brother took Pete's bike?
Yeah.

Yeah, but I mean,
you could just use Chrissy's.

Yeah, go for it.

The things we do for the Lord.

I doubt seeing
an out-of-shape city minister

ride a bike is on His wish list.

Well, getting to know Pastor Ezekiel
I'll bet you is.

Pastor Zeke.
Pastor Randy.

I thought this might be a little too early
for a Yankee city boy.

No, no, no, in the city, we like to say,
"Early bird gets the worm."

That's a good one. Okay, let's get rolling

before the sun gets so hot
it'll melt the smile right off your face.

Yes, sir.

That's your bike?

Well, I hope your chances
of finding a pastor

are better than your choice in bikes,

or I'll be leading this congregation
for the next 50 years.

Is this a joke?

Well, sir, it's kind of been
in the family a long time.

I'm just yanking your chain there.

I'm sure you'll find
somebody to replace me.

Maybe you have already.

Okay, let's get this show on the road
before it gets so hot,

we won't be able
to make sense out of anything.

You know what
that character Charlie Brown says?

What's that, sir?
He says, "Life is like a 10-speed bike.

Most of us have gears
we haven't even used yet."

Zeke.

Come on. Don't lollygag!
Pastor Ezekiel!

I suppose I should have
taken it easier on you,

being your first day and all.

I'll be all right, sir.

I just... need a moment
to catch my breath.

I just want to make one thing clear.

This retirement is not my idea.

I... still got a few good years left
in me.

I'm slowing down a bit.

I may lose a word,
lose my place occasionally.

I've been known to nod off
when Jimmy's choir starts caterwauling,

but I have the fire inside me.

You know, once you have
the word of God in your heart...

Well, you know what I mean.

Yes, sir.

I suppose they're right.

I should be thinking more
about the church,

and thinking about keeping it
energized and current,

and young folks coming back every week.

Then there's Ethel.
She's not getting any younger.

I suppose I should...

...do the right thing
and marry the old goat

while both of us...
still can remember our names.

Old goat, sir?

I've grown quite fond
of this congregation...

...and I will not turn it over
to the wrong person.

So, I am trusting you
to find the right person,

or you won't get me out of here
with a crowbar and a bag of peaches.

Well, you can count on me, sir.
I'm not going to let you down.

See that you don't.

Folks in Eufala don't take kindly
to having their business known,

but you just got to try and remember
that sometimes the folks that...

...seem to need help the least
are the ones that need it the most.

Hey, I can give you a ride.

No.

That's all right. I'm okay.

City people.

Gosh. I really just want
to jog in peace, okay?

I was just headed your way,
and I thought, you know,

if you're almost finished
with your exercise there,

we could grab that interview.

Look, Norma, I'm sorry. I just...

I know. I know.
You're used to having your own space.

I've been there.
Yeah.

There's something to be said
for life in the big city,

being left alone, being anonymous.

Any chance you got time for that interview
this afternoon, Mary Louise? Say 4:00?

Yeah, all right. Sure.
Okay, I'll see you at 4:00.

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Is anyone here?</i>

Right here!

Hello?

I'm in here, honey.

Hi.

I hope you don't mind.

I just came in through the front door,
'cause it was unlocked.

That lock hasn't worked in years.

You people don't lock your doors?

Why on Earth would we do that?

Right.

You look terrible.

Well, thank you.

Is this my desk?

Yes.
Yeah?

Okay, these are
next Sunday's church bulletins.

Pastor Zeke likes me to get them
printed up by Tuesday

on account that if I didn't,

people will keep adding stuff
till the last minute.

So, I thought you might like
to take a look.

Great. Let's see here.

"6:00 p.m. Bean Supper, Fellowship Hall.

Music to follow."

That's good. That's cute.

I don't get it.

"Bean supper. Music to follow."

Yeah, beans and music.

Yeah, I guess I am funny
and not just pretty.

I'm sorry that the place is such a mess.

I tend to get a little bit behind
in my filing

on account of I'm only here
a couple hours.

I have to leave at noon to go do hair.

Reva's Curl Up & Dye Beauty Salon.

"Curl Up & Dye"?

Are you serious?

Our motto is,

"If you're not becoming to him,
you better be coming to us."

You should give that to your wife.

I mean, not that
your wife's not becoming to you.

Oh, my gosh. Of course she isn't.

You're a pastor.
It's not like you guys are...

No, no, I appreciate my wife's appearance
just as much as any other man.

That's not what I meant to say.

I didn't mean that I appreciate other men
appreciating my wife's appearance.

That's not what I...

You're bad.

Am I interrupting something?

Thank goodness. Please do come in.

I got to get to Reva's Curl Up & Dye.

It's not going to open itself, now is it?

Please, sit down.

Hi.

How can I help you?

Well...

...Pastor Ezekiel hasn't paid attention
to things for a little while.

And?
And well, look around.

I mean, we're busting at the seams.
Everything is all worn out, out of date.

I see. So you have some suggestions
that you'd like to make.

All right... new choir robes.

Choir robe.
State-of-the-art sound system.

State-of-the-art sound system.
Yeah.

And a real rehearsal space.

And an actual pastor's office.

New pastor's office. Thank you.

What we need is a new building.

New building? Listen...

...I am the temporary pastor here,

but mainly, I'm here
to find a replacement for Pastor Ezekiel,

so you might want to take this up with...

Pastor Randy, think of this
as an opportunity

to make a real difference here in Eufala.

Mary Louise, I just want to say
thank you so much

for having me in your beautiful home
for the interview.

I've been real excited.

Now, I do understand you've already met
Eufala's most influential people.

Widow Smythe for example.

Yes, Mrs. Smythe does seem to have
quite a hold on this town, doesn't she?

I know. I don't get it myself.

It's always been that way.

And you know what?
I guess it always will be.

Here you go.
Thank you.

So tell me, what do people in Eufala do?

I mean, for fun?

Well, a lot of the women,
they like their scrapping.

Scrapbooking, putting photos in books.

Quilting, swap meets.

On the weekends, you got your rodeos,

and your square dancing, and pie baking.

Bingo. Bingo is real fun.

I almost won once.

Gosh, I really miss the big city.

Not like the city.
Not like the city.

Shopping, restaurants,

museums, art galleries,

opera, Broadway.

Seems I never had time
to do any of those things.

That's one thing
you'll have plenty of in Eufala.

Time?
Time.

Mary Louise, don't get me wrong.

There's a lot to be said
for living in a place like Eufala.

Clean air, clean water,

no traffic, no lines.

No lines ever.

People here, they're different.

Everyone knows everyone else.

They always smile and say hello to you

when you pass them by on the street
for no reason.

And they're always willing to help.

No matter what.

That actually sounds kind of great.

Widow Smythe!

I mean, Mrs. Smythe.
I'm so sorry. Please...

Save the pleasantries, young man.

I'm sure you know

that I am the most generous supporter
of this church.

Without me...

Well... let's just say
I expect to be consulted

before you make the decision
on the replacement pastor.

I've made myself clear?
Abundantly.

Sorry I'm late.

Right.
Reva didn't tell you.

I swear my sister would
forget her own name

if it wasn't written
right there on her license.

You were saying?
Right.

Well, in addition to being
the youth group director,

I also fill in as church secretary
on the afternoons when Reva leaves to...

Does hair.
Right.

There is so much work to do around here.

It's no wonder Reva can't make
heads or tails of anything.

I do what I can, but...

...to be quite honest...

...planning the youth group musical
doesn't really leave me

a lot of time to do much else, so...

...been pretty busy.

Planning a musical?

I call it <i>God Star.</i>

It's kind of a mixture between <i>Godspell</i>
and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

I think of it as like
a feel-good rock opera

based on <i>The Gospel of Matthew</i>
and ending with the Last Supper.

And... it all takes place... Wait for it.

...on the Ark.

You're building an ark?

Lord willing and the creek don't rise.

Lord willing... creek don't rise.

I'm gonna need a translator.

So, do we have the funds
for this little production?

You know, funds schmunds, right?

All anyone ever cares about is money.

Come on, people. This is art.
It's theater!

Great.

This looks great.

Everybody brought so much food yesterday,
it's like...

I got like eight pies, cake,

and two casseroles I don't even recognize.

Mary Louise?

You think you could learn
to love living in Eufala?

You taping this?
Totally off the record.

To be honest with you,
I'm not completely sure.

But I told my husband
I would give it a good try, so...

That's all we can ask for.

Hey, I've told you all sorts
of personal stuff about me.

It's your turn.

Guys, it was nice of your mom
to invite me over for lunch.

Yeah, I guess.
I mean, we had all these people

that brought over food,
so it's a shame to see it go to waste.

Well, it was still nice of her.

Are you not gonna eat that?

She's a vegan, so...

That's cool. I'm a Scorpio, so...

She doesn't eat meat.

Studies show that vegans live
up to nine years longer than meat eaters.

Okay, yeah,
but I don't want to die tomorrow

knowing that I could've had
a piece of steak today.

You know, Peter,
you should try out for the baseball team.

You look like a natural athlete.

Only if video tennis counts.

Actually, Peter, you should try out.

I mean, you know what Mom always says.

Nothing amazing ever comes
from staying in your comfort zone.

Besides it's a way to make friends,
so win-win.

You guys are so lucky.
I always wanted a brother.

Yeah. Lucky.

Well, like I said, my Uncle Danny,
he's the youth group leader at church.

This is interesting because...

Danny is in charge of fund-raising,

like, you know, car washes,
and bake sales, and musicals.

Lots and lots of musicals.

We actually just started rehearsals.

You're in a musical?

I mean, no offense,

but you don't exactly look
like the performing type.

Unless you're performing
a dissection or something.

You're right.
It's not anything I want to do,

but since my uncle is
the youth group leader at church,

I don't really have a choice.

Now, neither do you.

No, I'm not really a singer or anything.

Come on, Danny says
it's like a rock opera.

How bad could it be?
Maybe it'll even be fun.

I doubt it.

Nothing amazing ever comes
from staying in your comfort zone.

Well, Alex says that
I'm a natural athlete, so...

...no present like the time.

That's not how the saying goes.

I will never figure boys out.

Me either,
but... it's kind of fun trying to.

Gosh, I can't believe I ate all that.

You know what they say.
Fresh air does that.

Well, wait a second.
Wait a second. Not so fast.

You promised me you were going
to tell me something about you.

No, I don't believe I did.

How do you know so much about the city?

Like with all teenage girls
growing up in a small town like Eufala,

I always dreamed
of moving to the big city.

So, right after college, I packed my bags,

and I moved to the big city

to chase my dreams
of being a big broadcast journalist.

It was a disaster.

It took me all of a month
to realize I was not cut out

for the cutthroat world
of the news entertainment industry.

So, I hopped the first flight
back to Eufala and...

...started all over again.

It was about that time,

the editor of <i>The Tattler</i>
was setting to retire.

Mary Louise, I saw it as a sign.

I sold everything I could lay my hands on,

and I bought that paper.

Yeah, here we are.

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed
this interview on you

so soon right after you moved here.
Gosh. No, no, no, no!

Don't be silly. I totally understood.

You were just doing your job, right?

You got to understand.

People around here,
they're not used to change.

Case in point. Pack N Shop closed,

and Piggly Wiggly moved right in.

Lord, it was terrible.

The people were screaming and crying
in the parking lot.

I mean, it was just terrible.

Not Eufala's most proudest moment.

It's natural for people
to want to resist change.

You should have seen
the fight I put up with Randy

when he told me
we were moving to Arizona.

No offense.
No offense taken, really.

What's up with you and Reva?
It's nothing, really.

I can recognize a couple of alley cats
fighting a block away.

It's silly.

Spill it.

Reva has a thing for Jimmy,
the choir director.

Why does she insist on flirting
with Officer Barney?

And you like Officer Barney.

Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

He's handsome.

That uniform right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Reva has Jimmy.

Why does she have to flirt
with my Officer Barney?

I cannot compete with that, Mary Louise.

Hey, hey, hey, relax.

Reva doesn't have anything
that you don't have.

Are you serious?
Yeah.

Have you seen her? She's so beautiful.

I could never be like that.

Stand up. Stand up a minute.
Let me look at you.

Come on.

Not so close.

Well?

I've had more challenging cases.

See? I told you.

No, no, sweetie, you don't give yourself
any credit. You know that?

You're beautiful.

For some reason,
you just don't want anyone to know it.

What color is this, aircraft carrier?

No, it's gray.
You need a makeover, stat.

And you're in luck,
because I happen to be an expert

at... well, challenging cases.

I'm sorry. I can't.

What? Why not?

I'm sorry. I can't afford
the fancy things you have.

I'm sorry, Mary Louise.
I should get going.

Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Please.

Sit down. Let me tell you a story.

Come on. Sit down.

When I was a little girl growing up...

...we didn't have much money.

And honestly,
it really didn't bother me much.

Just one day in high school, and...

...I was in the locker room
with these rich girls, and...

...I just couldn't help but notice
their flawless skin,

and their straight teeth...

...matching underwear.

It was that day I decided
I was going to be rich one day.

Then I fell in love with Randy...

...and, well, let's just say

I'm rich in a way I never ever imagined.

And if I wanted nice things,

I just had to learn how
to be a smart shopper.

Mary Louise, do you think
you could teach me?

Where's the best beauty shop in town?

Hi.

I was hoping you'd come by.

I've been dying to get my hands
on this glorious hair of yours.

Well, actually, I was hoping
you could help my friend Norma.

Norma. Come on, let's see
what kind of magic Reva can work on you.

Come on, honey.

I've been meaning
to do something about this.

Reva, I don't think so.
Come on.

Reva.
Don't you look lovely?

Are you serious?
There you go. Marvelous.

Sit.

See? Better already.

What?
That's my mom.

I wonder what's going on in there.

Yeah.

You care about what
your parents think, right?

You know, you do what
they want you to do?

Yeah, I guess.

Reva wants me to go
into cosmetology school...

...as soon as I graduate...

...and work here in this salon with her.

That sounds pretty good to me.
Are you kidding?

Chrissy, as soon as I graduate, I'm gone.

You know... it's not so bad here.

That's easy for you to say,

because... you didn't have
to live here your whole life.

What's it like, living in the city?

Dirty...

...noisy, smelly.

Sounds kind of wonderful.

Yeah, and kind of wonderful.

You know it's why
I dress like this, right?

Dirty, noisy, and smelly?

No, grungy and rock.

I keep hoping
that Reva will finally get the hint

that I don't want to work here
at the salon with her.

I want to go places and see things.

Why don't you just tell her?
She has her heart set on it.

And it's so frustrating, because...

...she already has
my whole future planned out for me.

Sorry I can't stop to chew the fat.

What are these?
Resumes for the replacement pastors.

Wonderful.

Mary Louise and Reva, thank you so much.

She looks amazing.

You know, I never would have thought
of that look for her, but you were right.

Maybe we should team up.

Reva's Curl Up & Dye
Beauty Salon and Consultant.

Hey, I'm next.

No, no, no, I'm next.

Me.
No.

Okay, people!

Okay, listen up, people! Come on!

I said, "People!"

That's better.

Now we've got six months to raise funds,

write, rehearse, and stage this musical,

so anyone who is not 100% committed,

well, I invite you to make our lives
a little bit easier and just leave now.

Good.

Now. We've got a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time to do it,

so let's get started.

You know what they say.
There's no present like the time.

That's not how the saying goes.

You're just adorable, aren't you?

I have our lovely piano player...

...Mabel, here to play for us.

Ain't that right, Mabel?

Old arthritis is really setting in,
ain't it?

Now, I know this is our first run-through,
so I don't expect it to be perfect.

He does.
I do.

I do. That I do.

But don't you worry about it, all right?

So let's get going.

Let's just not embarrass ourselves.
Embarrass.

Mabel! Turn it up, girl!

<i>We invite you to a very special dinner</i>

<i>Where the son of God is</i>
<i>our most important guest</i>

<i>- There'll be wine</i>
<i>- And bread</i>

And cheese.

<i>Of every flavor, so be happy</i>

<i>For we never know what's next</i>

It's happening!

Seriously, do you guys have to do this
in here?

Well, we do until you figure out some way
to get us our own choir room.

I told you that that is not my job.

My job is to find you a new pastor.

Well, of course, if you don't want
to have music on Sunday services...

No, no, we don't want that.

Please, just a little lower, okay?

A little lower volume?
You got it, Pastor Randy.

Okay.

Time to finish the ark.

Of course it is.

Hey, Pete. What are you doing here?

It's a permission slip.
I'm on the baseball team.

Are you kidding me?

Wait, wait, wait, you're talking
about... the actual baseball team.

You're not talking about a video game?

Pete, that's amazing!

I'm just the assistant manager.

"Just the assistant manager."

Dude.
Dad, don't "dude" me.

Sorry. I'm getting
a little excited right now,

but honestly, dude,
son, do you realize that the manager

is the most important person on the team?

It's okay, I guess.
No, it's not just okay.

Without a good manager,
the whole team falls apart.

It's just like a... Like a pastor.

A pastor is like a team manager
to the church.

You have the choir.
You have the youth group minister.

You have the congregation.

The pastor holds all the pieces together,

gives everybody what they need,
so that the team can win.

Okay, Team Church!
Team Church.

All right.

Dad, Chrissy and Alex are
in the car waiting.

Yes!

There you go, team manager.

Thanks.

Go get 'em!

Team manager son!

Hi, honey.
Hey.

You're cooking?

Can you believe it?

Where's the fire extinguisher?

The women from church shared
their favorite recipes with me.

I never thought I'd enjoy it so much.

Well, just when I thought
I had seen everything. Listen to this.

Guess who made
the high school baseball team.

Honey, do you really think
that's such a good idea?

I mean, I know you felt really energetic
after your bike ride

with Pastor Ezekiel, but this is...
No, honey, I'm not talking about me.

I'm talking about Peter.
What?

Assistant manager, just like his old man.

I didn't see that coming.

No.
No.

Well, listen, I also have some news.

Reva asked me
to go into business with her.

Reva, my secretary, Reva?

You happen to be looking at Eufala's
one and only fashion consultant.

Honey, all those years of shopping
are finally paying off.

Listen, you're not getting
too involved, are you?

You know as soon as I find a new pastor,
we're out of here.

I don't want you to get too...

Attached?
Attached.

Honey, I thought you'd be happy.

I mean, we're all really trying here.

Well, you look happier
than a tornado in a trailer park.

Tornado in a...
Trailer park?

Gosh, I am spending far too much time
with Reva.

Yeah.

Well, Chrissy's going to be in the youth
group musical production with me.

Really?
I'm gonna be a cow.

You have to love the irony.

Because I'm a vegan.

Right. Yeah.
Yeah.

Hey. And where are you going?

I must be dreaming,
so I'm gonna go lay down.

Congratulations, honey.

You hungry?

Here you go.

Thank you.
What's this?

It's recyclable.

Yeah, I believe we've got
to, like, cherish this planet

that God has entrusted to us, you know?

Right. Do you have any church experience?

Well, I got this song.

Cool, cool. Okay.

<i>Come thy fountain</i>

<i>Something, something</i>

<i>And the screams of...</i>

I have the perfect role
for him in <i>God Star.</i>

<i>And goodbye horses</i>

Yes.

<i>And something</i>

I know what you're asking yourself.

How did I get to be so perfect

to take over
this here church-type establishment place?

Let me tell you.
I got a 90-minute PowerPoint,

gonna bring it right here.
We can sit through it.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Not on my watch, you don't.

Zeke.

I'll be at the Dairy Queen.

Everything okay, boss?

Yeah, I just...

...thought I saw someone I know.

Don't worry about it, boss.
We'll find the right person for the job.

I bet the guy upstairs
already has somebody picked out.

Somebody who needs to be in Eufala
just as much as we need him here.

Though... he may not know it yet.

I had no idea
it was going to be this difficult.

What? What are you talking about?

I thought we were doing just fine.

I mean, the kids have
never been happier, and...

...I'm really enjoying working with Reva.

No, honey, I'm talking
about finding the new pastor.

I mean, you should have been there,
Mary Lou.

You wouldn't believe these candidates.

This place is... special. It's different.

They deserve someone
who is going to take care of them,

someone who is going
to take the position seriously...

...not just use it
as a stepping stone to something else.

Sounds like someone I know.

Anyone promising in that new batch?

Not a one, Reva.

I mean, you'd think there would be
one good candidate

in this entire bunch,
but there's just not.

Just don't give up.

I have this feeling that one of these days
you're gonna wake up

and find the answer,
clear as the nose on your face.

Thank you.

Looking lovely as ever, Reva.

Thank you.
How are you this morning?

I am finer
than a frog hair split four ways.

Mind if I have a word
with Pastor Randy here?

Of course not.
I'll just go check on Danny.

Holler if you need me.
All right.

I'm going to speak my mind for a moment,

if that's all right with you.
Of course, Pastor.

I've been watching you
for these past few months,

and it doesn't take an eagle's eye

to see that something is troubling you.

Well...

...I came to Eufala
with a specific purpose,

and I just feel like I'm letting you
and the congregation down.

No, you can't blame yourself for that.

You can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

Never find a diamond in a pile of manure.

That I understand.

All right.
But what I don't understand is,

why did God choose me for this task?

I mean, I'm...

I'm used to dealing with people that have
a completely different set of problems,

a completely different set of needs.

No one knows what God's plan is for us,

what purpose is hidden
in the things we do in our lives.

The things that happen to a man
as he plods through his life,

these are the things that shape
the man he is to become.

Now, the fact that you have given
your heart and soul to this assignment

and the love and the devotion
you have for your wife and children,

these are the things that you've become.

These are the gifts from God.

Even if they're not wrapped
in ways we can always see.

Now, I know that your time here
is diminishing down,

and it's quite possible
that you will be reassigned

before you can get the fine folks
of Eufala a proper minister.

What would happen to the church?

Well, you don't have a dog in that fight.

You've done the best you can.

No, no, no. No, I'm not leaving here
until I find you a new pastor.

I think that you should give
the sermon next week.

I don't...
Now, don't get me wrong.

I appreciate everything you've done
organizing the place

and keeping Danny and Jimmy in check.

You heard about that?

Jimmy's eyes are always going to be
a lot wider

than this church's little budget will
ever be.

But... folks in this community have grown
quite fond of you and your family.

And they know
that your time is at a close,

and they're going to want to hear
what you have to say.

Can I have some time to think about it?

Afraid not. Already settled.

Pastor.

You take care of yourself.

Thanks, Pastor.

Come on. Hurry up. We're going to be late.
I got things to do too.

I have no idea why a girl as pretty as you
would want to dress like a mortician.

Look how you dress.

Sweetie, you'll be very well served
to take a good long look at how I dress.

The future co-owner
of Reva's Curl Up & Dye Beauty Salon

has got to look the part.
That's all I'm saying.

I'm not you!

Why do you always worry
about what I'm going to do with my future

when I don't even know what I want to do?

Sweetie, if you want to be a brain surgeon
or an astrophysicist,

you better get yourself a scholarship,

and then Reva will just go
curl up and dye on her own.

It's not always about you.

Sometimes it's about me, too.

I'm sorry.

Sweetie...

...I want whatever you want
for yourself, for your future.

This is what parents do.

We worry about our kid's dreams.

Is that so bad?

It's okay, I guess.

Mom...
Do I have something in my teeth?

No, Mom!

On the way to the salon...

...can we please talk
about what I want to do with my future?

I'm all ears.

I'm all ears.

Pastor Ezekiel is right.

I think the congregation would love
to hear a sermon from you.

I don't think
they're gonna take too kindly to me

when they realize
that I haven't done my job.

They won't take too kindly?

Very funny.

I admit it. Eufala is rubbing off on me.

I just hope
the pastoral committee gives me more time.

We have to leave Eufala?

Come on over, kids. This concerns you.

We were just starting to like it here.

Yeah, where are they gonna send us?
No telling.

The church in the old neighborhood
is already closed, so...

So, we're gonna have to start all over
in a new place?

We're a family. We stick together.

<i>Working together, we will</i>

<i>Carry out His master plan</i>

<i>Amen</i>

I know each and every one of you
like the back of my hand.

Don't deny it.

You think I'm an old man
who falls asleep in church.

I have been known to nod off on occasion.

I miss a verse now and then, but...

Maybe I should turn
this fine congregation over

to somebody younger,
somebody with new ideas.

Don't worry, Ethel.

Everybody knows it's true.

It's time.

Now we've been fortunate
that Pastor Randy has been so generous

in giving of his time
to help us find a new pastor,

but... sadly, that time is at hand,

and he will be leaving us soon.

Now, I don't know what'll happen

to our little church community
once he's gone,

but I do know that each
and every one of us

are the better for having gotten to know
Pastor Randy and his family.

And quite possibly,
this might be our last opportunity,

so with your permission...

...I have asked Pastor Randy
to give the sermon next week.

All right, sonny,
what have you got for us?

Five eighty-nine,
<i>What a Friend We Have in Jesus.</i>

If I drift off on you, just please know

that I am surfing on your heavenly voices.

Good morning, ladies.
Morning.

Do you not know that in a race

all the runners run,
but only one receives the prize?

So, run that you may obtain it.

First Corinthians, 9:24.

You two are on the team too, huh?

Yeah.
It's all about stamina.

Mary Louise has changed our world.

You too, of course, Pastor Randy.

That's so sweet, Norma. Thank you.
Yeah.

See you in a couple of hours.
All right.

Bye, sweetie. Have fun. Have fun, girls.
Okay. Come on, girls.

Bye!
Bye!

Must be in the country.

Hey!
Hey!

Hi, how you doing?

What are you guys doing here?

We came to help you pack.
Surprise!

Right, well... I don't know what to say.

Now, don't get all mushy on us.

It was Tina's idea.

We really missed you guys.
Let's catch up later, okay, guys?

'Cause he's got a sermon.

We'll see you out there.
Okay.

We're gonna go find seats.

Bye, honey.

Would you relax?

I swear you are jumpier
than a long-tailed cat

in a roomful of old ladies
on a sunny afternoon.

I've never seen you like this.
What's going on, honey bear?

I'm just nervous, that's all.

You, nervous?

Why? What does a big strapping man
like you got to be nervous about?

Well...

...Pastor Randy.
I know.

I know.

We are all very sad that Pastor Randy
and his family are leaving.

That's not it.

Pastor Randy, he asked me to speak
in front of the service this morning.

So?
Well, I mean, I'm just...

I'm not good at that sort of thing.
What if I mess up or something?

Sweetie, you stand
in front of that church every Sunday,

and you lead the choir.

That's right, I lead the choir.
I don't have to say a word.

Baby, that's not what you got
all of your boxers in a bunch over.

Now be honest with me.

You can tell little Reva.

Well, I've been watching Pastor Randy
these last couple of months...

...and I see how much he loves his family.

And it's got me to thinking.

I mean, I know how people see me
as this big, tough,

good-looking, handsome,
king-of-the-road type of guy...

...but I want what Pastor Randy has.

I want to settle down.

Well, you've always got me, haven't you?

Come on, a girl as pretty as you?

I mean, I see how guys look at you

and how you flirt with Officer Barney.

Why would you want to settle
with a guy like me?

Now, Jimmy Watkins,
this color green is not good on you.

All this flirting is just Reva being Reva,

and expecting me to change is like
asking a leopard to shed his spots.

But if you're asking to make
an honest woman out of me...

I am.

Well, then get down on your knee!

Now, honey, you give me some sugar.

And you go out there, and you show them
what Jimmy Watkins is made of.

Full house to hear your sermon.

Butterflies?

I'm more nervous about this sermon
than... I've been in a long time.

Well, maybe that's a good thing.

I mean, things had gotten pretty simple
for you back in LA.

Parishioners...

...the same questions, the same answers.

You just didn't have to push yourself,
you know, honey?

Just kind of... going through the motions.

I just don't seem to be
reaching this congregation

the way that I did back in the city.

Honey...

...people are people,

whether you're in the city or the country.

And we all have the same basic fears...

...dreams...

...prayers.

Only the circumstances are different.

Speak to that, and you'll do just fine.

How'd you get so smart?

I have been listening to your sermons
for more than 12 years, that's how.

What do you think?
I was reading fashion magazines?

You should read this.

<i>A few months ago,</i>
<i>Eufala welcomed Pastor Randy,</i>

<i>its new interim pastor.</i>

<i>Many were skeptical</i>
<i>that a pastor used to ministering</i>

<i>to an inner city congregation</i>
<i>could have any relevance here.</i>

<i>And I was one of them.</i>

Keep reading.

<i>Many didn't see any reason</i>
<i>to give pastor Randy a chance.</i>

<i>No real obligation</i>
<i>to get to know the man and his family.</i>

<i>But as local resident</i>
<i>Lila van der Gelder reminds us,</i>

<i>"That's not how we do things in Eufala,</i>
<i>is it?</i>

<i>"Truth is, we never know how long</i>
<i>someone's going to be in our lives,</i>

<i>so we just welcome them</i>
<i>as though it's going to be forever."</i>

<i>As it turns out in this case,</i>

<i>it isn't going to be forever.</i>

<i>Pastor Randy and his family</i>
<i>will leave us in just a few short weeks.</i>

<i>But I, for one...</i>

<i>...I am so glad to have known</i>
<i>this wonderful, beautiful family,</i>

<i>to count them as my friends.</i>

<i>I suggest Eufala will come to realize</i>
<i>just how fortunate we were</i>

<i>to have known pastor Randy</i>
<i>and his family as part of our church.</i>

<i>Even if it is just for a short while.</i>

<i>Times like this,</i>
<i>we all need a guardian angel.</i>

Well...

This is... certainly a surprise.

I just came to see how things were...
working out for you here.

Good. Good. Things are...
They're actually working out really well.

Word is you've turned down
every applicant you've seen thus far.

Every one.
Well, that is because I haven't found

an applicant that I feel is fit
for this congregation.

You know...

You know, Randy.

Every successful businessman
will tell you that

reviewing job applicants
is like ordering a pizza.

Now, there's a million ingredients
you may think

you want in your perfect pizza,
but the truth is...

...you probably wouldn't like
the combination.

I mean, pineapple and jalapeÃ±os,

they probably thought
that was a good idea, right?

Well, I will find the right person.

I will. I just need more time.

You've seen all the applicants.
You've seen them all.

And since you haven't found
a suitable replacement in the bunch...

I have six months.

Randy, I'm afraid the church
is going to be forced to close its doors.

The congregation will be invited to join
the church all the way in New Calgary.

No, no, no,
New Calgary is an hour from here, okay?

These people love this church.

This community needs this church.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Hey. Hey.
Hey.

So I had the talk with Reva...

...with my mom, and you were right,

because she only wants me to be happy.

Yeah? And what's all this?
I mean, you're normally in black, Alex.

Yeah, I know, but...

...it turns out being with my mom
sort of does make me happy.

It shows.
And now that I have a friend in town...

Yoda. Yeah, she thinks
you're pretty cool too.

Eufala's looking a whole lot better
to me now.

Let's pray!

It's show time.

You're gonna be great.

Good morning.

I would like to start
this morning's sermon

with something that's quite unpopular
back in the city.

I want you to turn
to the person in front of you

and behind you and welcome them.

When you think about it,

aren't we all planning
on spending eternity together?

I figure, let's get a head start.

Let's get to know each other now.

When I was thinking
about what I was gonna say

to you fine people of Eufala this morning,

a certain panic came over me.

What wisdom did this city minister have
to impart to you country folk

who have so graciously welcomed
my family and me into your community?

Luckily, I have my rock, Mary Louise,

who reminded me that people are people.

We all have the same dreams, fears,
desires, questions.

But we have received so much from you.

You have taught us city folk

the true meaning of "love thy neighbor"...

...what it means to give

without even thinking
of receiving anything in return,

about having the courage
to let your guard down

and live openhearted...

...to trust one another,

to greet each other with a smile...

...to have joy amongst you.

What a concept.

It was a bit of an adjustment
for us coming from the city

where it's survival of the fittest
and every man for himself.

Eufala for us has been
a blessing from God.

It's been a lesson
in how to love one another.

But I wasn't sent here to receive.

I was sent here with a task.

To find a replacement

for the irreplaceable Pastor Zeke
as he retires.

I stand before you, Eufala,
with that task incomplete.

I haven't found anyone worthy of you.

I haven't found anyone

who will offer you the love
that you offer one another.

So this morning, I'm reminded of how
the apostles must have felt

before Jesus performed the miracle
of feeding the 5,000

with two fish and five loaves.

Jesus tested them.

He turned to them and said,
"You feed them."

Through their faith,
all were provided for.

And through our faith, we pray...

...that God will provide the right pastor
for this wonderful church.

Give me an amen.
Amen!

I hope you don't mind, Pastor Zeke,

but I've asked a friend of yours

to prepare something special
for you this morning.

Jimmy?

Thanks, Pastor.

All right.

Zeke...

...you've been a part of my life...

...well, ever since I've been knee-high
to a grasshopper.

So, I wanted to do something
to show you...

...how much you mean to me.

Really, to all of us.

So, if you don't mind...

...I'd like the choir to sing
your favorite church song.

<i>Take off your bandages</i>

<i>It's time to heal</i>

<i>So, you can try again</i>

Wasn't that an awesome sermon?

Seriously, it's a beautiful day.
Everyone is so happy to be here.

Could it get any better than this?
I say unto you no way.

For heaven's sake.
This is church, young man.

We're not in heaven yet.
Yeah.

Save some of that enthusiasm
for the after-party.

Just show me. What is it?

You're never going to believe this.

You and your wife can be very inspiring.

You two?
Yeah!

Congratulations.
Thank you.

That's wonderful.
Hey, Pastor Randy,

I know what you're thinking, too.
That there is a real diamond.

I wouldn't doubt it, Jimmy.

Let's go show it off.
We got to show everybody, Pastor Randy.

All right.

Thank you very much for coming.
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

Come back now.

That was a beautiful sermon, Randy.

Thank you. It meant so much to me
to have you guys here.

What did you think, Joe?

Not bad. Who knew you had it in you?

Well, you know, if you'd ever show up
to church every once in a while...

Yeah, yeah. Come on, T.
I need a cup of Joe.

Good to see you.
Good to see you.

And then Sunday is pancake day.

Yeah?
I love pancake day.

Yeah, I like pancakes too.

Hey. Rain, he came all the way
from Los Angeles

just to hear your sermon.
Isn't that awesome?

Had to see what wonderful place
you landed in, my friend.

Eufala? Wonderful?

I'm not sure I'd go that far.

Well, no, I mean look around

at all these wonderful people
in your life, sunshine.

I mean, the folks
who really care about you,

your dreams, your worries.
Yeah.

See now...

Now, that's what makes
Eufala special, Alex. Real special.

Don't ever forget that.

This was part of your plan,
all along, wasn't it?

Well, not just mine...

...but yes.

Okay, well, I promised
to get Rain some coffee and...

Please.
All right. And a donut, right?

Yes, yes. Sprinkles on top?
Yeah.

Strawberry?
Yes.

Turquoise? Turquoise? Really?

Hey, Dad, is it okay
if I go over to Alex's later

if I promise to stay up
all night and pack?

I thought you and Alex...

Yeah, she comes off
madder than a wet hen...

"Madder than a wet hen"?

Yeah, apparently,
that's how we all talk now.

Okay, look, I just mean
once you get past her tough exterior,

she's all right.

And later, I'm gonna go down
to the ball field for batting practice.

What, I can't turn into a jock?
No!

Yes, you can.

Mary Louise, can I talk to you?

Just for a second?
Sure.

Yeah, babe?
How much do you like it here?

Well, you can't blame him really.

I mean, he doesn't have
the sense God gave lettuce.

Pastor Ezekiel.

Hey.
Hey.

Widow Smythe... Mrs. Smythe.

I would like to recuse myself
from the panel

of reviewing the candidates
for your replacement.

What for? I thought
that's the reason you came here.

What's this?
That's my resume.

I'd like to be considered
as a candidate for the new pastor.

Well, I'll have to take it
into consideration.

All right, I've considered it.

This congregation would be very fortunate

to have you and your family
as our new pastor.

Welcome home, son.

Don't snap his head off.
He's our new pastor.

Don't disappoint me, young man.

It was <i>Love Me Tender,</i>
not <i>Girls! Girls! Girls!</i>

Kids, welcome to Eufala.

Thank you.
Thank you.
