<b>THE DOOMS CHAPEL HORROR</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

It's going to
be hotter tomorrow.

Which is why we shouldn't
be jackassing around.

Can you give me
a hand down here?

It does this
every single year.

I don't understand
why dad just doesn't

get out and get a new one.

It's an expensive rig, Kyle.

With what little we have from
agriculture, it makes no sense.

I'm going
to go get a soda.

There's water in the jug.

I don't want water.

You know what
daddy's going to say.

Son, get back out there
and help your brother...

and put that damn camera down
before it's gone for good.

I's just getting us sodas.

Water's in the jug.
You know that.

I don't want...

Ryan.

Emmett?

Ryan!

No.

No!

No.

I haven't watched
that in a long time.

How long, Kyle?

I think it's been about...
11 years... since Ryan died.

I think everybody probably had
somebody like Ryan in their lives.

He's perfect, you know, all-American
high school quarterback.

He wasn't just Katie
and Emmett's son.

He was Kaler Mills' son.

And they all thought
I killed him.

A copy of the tape
showed up in my locker.

That's when I
started watching it.

I got to be obsessed with
the video after a while.

I watched it over and over...
for a long time.

He was just...

How at that moment
that he died...

the way mom and dad
looked at me...

you know, knowing it was...
it was my fault.

And the accidental release of
the tape didn't help that.

How did that happen?

Some fine, upstanding employee of the
Kaler Mills Sheriff's Department

saw fit to take it home.

After that, it got out.

Everybody saw me bitching
about having to help Ryan.

And because I was
jackassing around...

they all watched him die.

It's on
the internet today.

It's... I mean, it's the reason why
we're together for this project.

You know, you'd be surprised
how many people know who I am

even though my face isn't
even on camera, just Ryan's.

What can you
tell me about yourself?

Why do you think
this stuff isn't my thing?

Kyle, you think too much.

Does it even matter?

Sure it does.

How? Why does who you
aren't matter to you.

Well, look at you.

You go to dances, and you
go out every Friday night.

And whenever we go to dinner,
everybody knows you there.

And, like, whenever dad needs
help, he always goes to you.

That's because you always got
that camera glued to your face.

What else can I do?

I don't know.
Maybe help out.

Come on, little brother.

I like it.

And that's what matters.

I am who I am.

You are who you are.

Mom and dad are who they are.

There's no reason you
all got to be same.

Take some time, buddy.

You sure you're all right
to do this?

Yeah, I mean...

I agreed to it. I mean, it's
all... it's all fair game.

All right.

Hey.

Hi.

It's time to get up.

OK.

He's still sound asleep.

So much for first thing.

Yeah. I think he was
up most of the night

making his lists and
packing and stuff.

Yeah.
What a professional.

You should scan
these and then frame them.

That's what people do.

Is that right?

I don't even
know which one's me.

You look like your mom.

Yeah.

Ryan got the, rugged good
looks of big ol' Emmett Cole.

Damn.
You're right.

That was that same summer.

We don't have to look anymore.
OK?

Any of this bother you?

What?

My baggage.

I mean, we both
have baggage, Kyle.

I like the fact that
you've experienced life.

I think it's something
we both have in common.

You know that I... I
will never get the chance

like this to, go home again.

You shouldn't be
comparing scars, babe.

I know, and I'm not.

I just... I mean, look at you.

You're graduating
from film school.

You didn't end up in a frat.

You might go to LA,
and... and you have me.

Yeah, I do.

Yeah.

Henry.

I'll be damned.

Kyle Cole.

You ain't change one bit.

You have.

Look like you put
on about 50 pounds.

Lifting all them beers man.

It's good to see you.

-Who's this?
-This is Mandy.

Hi, Mandy.
I'm Henry.

-Nice to meet you.
-That's Tanner.

What's up?

You were a friend of
Kyle's before the accident?

Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

More like his only friend, but...
besides Ryan and his friends too

I mean, but... we pretty
much buddied up, just us.

And after the accident?

Well, after...
it's a little harder,

you know, to be his friend.

And his folks kind
of held Kyle up

as accountable
for what happened.

I think he did too,
you know, fault his self.

And that was then.

And if it happened again...
thank the Lord it won't...

I'd say fuck all the rest.

Well, as an administrator,

we see a few more kids
like Kyle each year.

You, worry about what sort
of person they'll end up being.

It seems like one little
push could send them off

in the wrong direction.

But even with the tragedy
and everything that followed,

I believe that our prayers
found their way back

to this young man.

I remember Kyle Cole.

After the accident,
Katie and Emmett

thought it be best if
Kyle were very active here

at the church of course.

And me being his
Sunday school teacher,

it just made sense for me to
lead his way through this.

What did Kyle
think about this plan.

Well, I...

Kyle, was, not the kind
of person you'd expect

to do something like this.

I mean, he was one of
the younger students,

one of the quieter boys.

But we all knew kids
like them, you know.

He was volunteering for
the fall harvest picnic.

It's just a wonderful buffet we
do every year for our church,

but I caught him peeing in the
giant jack-o-lantern Jell-O mold.

The Jell-O mix
was already in there,

and it was just hours
from setting up and I...

That's not funny.

That would have
been on the buffet table

for the entire
church family the next day.

I...

OK. OK.
I'm sorry.

I'm just expecting something...

Something worse?

Well, there was.

When I caught him,
he didn't, put it away.

He just stood there, and he
pointed at that Jell-O mold,

and he said,
"This is what I think

of your... f-ing self-righteous attempt
to make me forget all that's happened."

And then "How about you
be a good little... cunt

and go and tell them
all what I've done."

He waved me away.

I've never had anyone expose
themselves to me like that...

speak to me like that
for that matter... ever.

All right.

OK.

All right. We're done.

When you live
in a town like Kaler Mills

and you're lucky enough to
have a boy like Ryan growing up

around you, everybody
has hopes for him.

When he stayed to
work the family farm,

nobody... and I mean
nobody... complained.

Glad to have a man
like that around.

Real leader he was becoming.

Hell, I trusted
that 18-year-old boy

more than that sorry-ass deputy
I got stuck with.

Now, you knew
Ryan's brother Kyle as well.

Your son Henry was
good friends with him.

That's right.

You know, a boy that age, you
know who they'll be as a man.

Now, I can't say, as a lad, I
would have done Kyle any better

than his friends done him.

Henry was standing.

But I think when he left
to stay with Katie's sister

in the city to clean the
salt out of the wounds,

I think we all started to heal.

So this is it?

This is it.

Do you want
to talk to them?

They're not home.

It's a perfect
opportunity to get a few shots.

We don't have to.

Just a few shots.

It's up to you, babe.

Hang on.
I got to call you back.

Kyle Cole!

Welcome back.

Last I laid eyes
on you, Kyle Cole,

you was just a sorry
excuse for a little boy.

And there sure
ain't much changed.

Samuel.

I've got to tell you, Kyle...

Jordan hasn't forgotten...

about his, yours,
ours arrangement.

When kind of people
take a man's request lightly

and not see them through,
but you know that.

What you filming about?

We're shooting
a documentary.

I like that you
brought friends, Kyle.

I mean to say girlfriends.

Come on.
I'm just fucking with you.

Besides you'd look a whole lot
less like a piece of snatch

if it wasn't for that woman's
coat and them fucking boots.

Hey.

That was a long time ago.

OK?

Ain't no worries, but it doesn't
mean anything anymore, OK?

Just forget about it.

You and I both know that
you ain't doing this

out of the goodness
of your heart.

There ain't a drop of
goodness in you, Kyle Cole.

You wasn't thinking that it'd
be so simple making peace

after all these years?
Would you?

Guys, let's go.

Kyle!
My god.

Back the fuck up, bitch!

Back up, Mandy.

Hey, princess.

You and I both know what comes
from that there fucking heart.

I knows it, and most of
all, Jordan knows it too.

And it is plainly clear to me
that you are here to collect.

Jordan is going to be mighty
interested in my discoveries,

Kyle Cole.

Mighty interested.

In fact, well, I'd say he's been
waiting for this time to come.

We'll be gone in a few days.

Like I said!

Consider it done, my friend.

I'll be seeing you around,
Kyle Cole.

Hey.

Who the hell was that?

Long story.

Hey. Who are those guys at
the bar staring at us?

That's Ryan's friends.

Well, cheers to Kyle Cole
being back in Kaler Mills.

All right.

Welcome back, buddy.

Hey, Kyle,

So who was that
lunatic in the truck?

What lunatic?

He's from out on Dooms Chapel.

The hell they want?

It was just... just
somebody I used to know.

It was Samuel.

I knew the guy a little
bit after I withdrew,

I guess you might say.

Yeah, I'd say it.

Samuel?

Crazy bastard.

I just saw him around
a little more often.

I mean, it was just one guy.

He's in a commune.
Isn't he?

Yeah.
They are a commune.

They live out past
Dooms Chapel Road.

Most of them don't stray
too far from the property.

I just saw him around
a little more often.

That was it.

That's it?

That's it.

Samuel.

He ain't half as
scary as Jordan.

My dad wrangles a few of them
up every time we have a problem.

It's more or less to make
sure they know their place.

Who's Jordan?

Jordan is their,
cult leader.

Mostly the stories people
tell about Jordan that

gets everybody so freaked out.

Stories.

Tell.

Remember Bobby Day?
Big kid.

Beast of a kid.

Well, he claims Jordan
can raise the dead.

Well, tell it.
You know better than me.

Bobby had a story
about a barn raising

he and his daddy
was helping with.

Bobby claims he's on
the truck watching them

boys have a tough time at it.

Barn goes over right on top
of Buddy Defew's cousin.

Yeah.
I remember that.

These Dooms Chapel
folks walk up,

and Jordan clears everyone away.

Folks tend to do that
around him anyhow.

While he's all running around
screaming, Jimmy's dead!

Jimmy's dead!

Jordan bends down real
close, listening to him

like Jimmy saying something.

And then Jordan whispers
back into Jimmy's ear.

And then snap!

Jordan grabs Jimmy so hard,
and Jimmy gasps, gets up,

starts walking around.

Dead, then not dead.

Bullshit.
I don't buy that.

Believe it.

That guy still
telling that story today?

He can't.
Dead.

You know, usually when
you flush a piece of shit,

it stays gone.

Where you going?

Pisser.
You want to hold it for me?

Be like y'all are back
in the fourth grade.

-Is that right?
-Yeah.

I got.

I'll tell you what Kyle,
why don't we, see you

and your friends out of the bar.

Why don't you guys
just back the fuck up?

Get the fuck out. Get that
fucking camera out of here.

OK. This is dumb.
We'll just leave.

Not you, sugar tits!

Hey! Hey! We're grown
fucking adults. All right?

We're leaving.

-Excuse me.
-Come on, Tanner.

Kyle!

Stay down, boy!

Kyle, are you OK?

Come here.
Get back over...

Yeah.
Come on, Kyle.

We're walking your ass home.

Get back here, son of a bitch!

Kyle!

Let him go!
Come on.

Come on, RJ.

Go!

Come on.
Come on.

Now where the
fuck did y'all go?

Hiding like a bunch of little
bitches, what you doing.

Goddamn, why don't you
come on out of hiding?

Quit being a bunch of pussies!

Where them son of bitches at?

You know what that
means, don't you?

Henry!

You and your bitch
better come out, Henry!

Cheezberger is pissed,
and you remember

what he did to those
two nigs down in Salem.

What the fuck was that shit?
That came from the quarry.

Let's go!
It's them!

-Come on. Let's go.
-Get in the truck!

-Get on out of here.
-Come on!

Let's get back to the shop.

OK.

Let's go.

Dude, what
the fuck was that?

You got me.

Seriously.
What was that?

You think they're coming back...

Them drunks?

Ain't coming back up
in here unless they

want Betty and some rock salt
to teach them a thing or two.

Tell you what, man.

Sure ain't
changed much.

No, it hasn't.

I think we finally lost
them around the junkyard

right up here.

You could have
killed that guy last night.

No, I couldn't.

That's... it's... he's
done that before.

Remember that?
Yeah.

It seems like every time
I hang out with you,

I got to hit somebody
with a bottle.

I thought Randy was
going to kick my ass too.

Yeah.
I didn't even do it.

That's one of dad's deputies.

Let's, see what's going on.

Hey, what's up?

Henry?

Boy, you need to get on
down up by your daddy.

Go on.

Thanks.

I have a bad
feeling about this.

This... this is where
we heard that thing out here

last night.

You were here?

Yeah. We ain't going
to talk about all that

when we get up to Daddy, OK?

You better tell me that
you drove that thing

home last night, and you ain't
already been here this morning.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

What's going on?

We found that Curtis boy
and Cheezberger.

What were you boys
into last night.

We... we were out.

We got in a fight, dad.

What?

It was with Curtis,
Cheezberger, and RJ.

But we ran off and lost them
before anything got serious.

Jesus, Henry.

I know, dad.
But we lost them.

I mean, we've got
nothing to do with this.

We heard something last night.

Something big.
I don't know what.

You
say you heard something.

Yeah.
I... something howled.

I don't know what it... I
don't know what it was.

You looking for RJ?

Well, now we are.

Didn't have any
reason to think we

had a third victim
until you pulled up.

We'd like to help search.

-No.
-Yeah.

Yeah.
We should help too.

All right.
You can help.

But if you find something, you
call out and stay clear of it.

Whitess.
Sheriff.

Take these kids out there.

They want help look for RJ.

Yes, sir.

Deputy, you stay close to them,
and you keep them safe. You hear?

Yes, sir.

-OK.
-Come on, y'all.

Deputy, we...

did you get... did the
State get back with you?

Forensics on their way?

OK.

No.
We don't see nothing over here.

Over.

Smell that?

What is it?

Blood.

Piss.

My god.

My god.

I'm going
to call the sheriff.

Yeah, I think
we... I think we got it him.

Or... well, part of him.

Get those kids out of there.

Yeah, let's go.

Back up is on the
way to your 20.

Hey there, Deputy.

What do you think is
really going on up there.

Well, two boys, the
last people to see

some murder victims dead.

Then they got into a fight
with them before they got dead.

So I don't know.

You tell me, smart guy.

There's no way that they
could have done that.

Well,
that might be true,

but you don't just walk away
from something like this.

So your boy, man, he should've thought
long and hard before he came back

to old Kaler Mills.

The interview room!

Hey.

Welcome back, Jordan.

Thank you for the invitation.

Kyle out there
tells me that boy, Samuel...

and I know in turn that means
you... threatened them yesterday.

Samuel told me Kyle had
come home, which I always

expected he would do.

What this boy was
referring was a request...

A request that to this
day I have no idea why

he decided to involve me in.

Samuel was just reminding
him of that bit of vileness.

That's all.

The only threat was
the one made by Kyle.

What kind of...

Sheriff! Sheriff!

Son of a bitch!
You got to do something!

Can you
tell me what' going on?

You got to do something!
My boy's dead!

You son of a bitch!
You sons of bitches.

What the hell happened?
What happened?

I'll tear your
fucking heads off.

This whole fucking
town's going crazy, man.

Kyle...

The person I was
when I come to see you

ain't the person I am now.

We understand.

We're an imperfect
species, Kyle.

Each of us is bound to make
many mistakes in our lifetime,

but we pay for those mistakes.

Those men and women...

their mistake
was crossing a boy like you.

They've lived longer lives than
they deserve, now haven't they?

You've come here to receive your
own punishment for your crimes,

for your actions,
for your request.

But Kyle, it hasn't
been fulfilled yet.

They have not paid.

Now it's time for them
to face their mistakes.

It's time for their
innocence to be taken.

I'm not asking
you to do anything.

You did.

You did.

Now you see that
your mistake was

asking for such a selfish
thing in the first place.

Yes, it was.

All right?
It was a mistake.

But no matter what you
think you should do,

you leave everybody
else out of it.

Too late.

Too late, Kyle.
Too late.

Too late.
Too late.

The minute you set foot back in
my town, the end was in sight.

It's ready.

It's been ready all these
years, and it's hungry.

Lord God, it's hungry.

I got this
all on camera, Kyle.

We can take it to the Sheriff.

Do not!

Your sheriff has
not authority here.

This is law now.

What was that in
the woods last night?

Revenge.

Hey.
That was my dad.

Something big must've happened.

We're going back to Jordan's.

Come on, man. Whatever
happened... that was years ago.

And this ain't...
this ain't you.

Do you know that?
Look at that.

How do we know
that this ain't me?

That there ain't
nothing I can do?

Wait, Kyle.
What is it? What did you do?

Henry.

Yes, sir.

Any of you all got any
more answers for me.

No, sir.

I think Jordan
there was pretty fucking crazy.

What do you think?

Jordan is still in custody
and was when all this happened.

His people, in my experience,

they ain't going to do
something like this

without him being
there to oversee it.

Now, Kyle, I want
you to head home,

and I want you to stay in.

-Henry, I want you with me tonight.
-OK?

Yes, sir.

Hey.
Look.

No matter what you think they did,
just don't go making it worse.

Please?
See y'all later.

Last time I was here,
I got met at the front door

by Samuel and a rifle.

Jesus.

Now their security must
be,...getting lax.

Kyle?

Find anything?

What are we looking for?

Look. Jordan is
responsible for all this.

He said as much, right?

He said he'd get me some payback
for being treated so bad.

He promised to show them.

Show who?

Kaler Mills.

He said it'd be bad.

Promised it'd be bad.

Promised because you
wanted it to be bad?

Bad like people being
killed in the woods?

Is this what I think it is?

What?
Shit.

We got to go.
We got to go.

Come on.

What the fuck you
doing in my house, boy?

Sam... Samuel.

Spit it out!

Please don't hurt him.
Please.

Sweetheart, I almost
forgot you was here.

Mighty pretty girl
you got here, Kyle Cole.

Samuel.
Samuel.

Get on your knees, Kyle Cole.

I said get on your
fucking knees.

All right!
All right!

Samuel, don't hurt her.

Come back to me, OK?
Samuel!

Samuel!
Samuel!

Please, Kyle Cole.

I will do as I please.

I want it to stop.
OK.

I want it to stop.
That's all.

Stop Jordan, OK?

Stop Jordan?

What about me, Kyle Cole?

I could stop Jordan.

Maybe I could stop
Jordan for you?

See, the way I figure,
Kyle Cole...

you think you're on
to something here.

You think that you've got some
sort of educated understanding

of the goddamn
situation, but I'm here

to tell you, Kyle Cole, that
you don't have a fucking clue.

This is because of me, Samuel.

Just tell me.

Get the fuck up, Kyle.

You are one ungrateful
piece of shit.

Do you know that?

Do you know how many
people on our land

would kill for the kind of
heed that he is giving you.

I want it stop!

There's no going
back, Kyle Cole.

No undoing what has been done.

Do you understand me?

Now get the fuck
out of my house.

Samuel has his ideas.

I like to give him free
reign to experiment.

He has his ways...
but they're not mine.

They're not ours.

What? Not you? You killed
those animals and everyone...

Them?
No one else, Kyle.

We ain't murderers.

You, on the other hand...

What do you want, Jordan?

What do you want?!

All I wanted was to come back
here and make some peace.

And some stupid requests
that I made from you

years ago hangs over my head.

No.

I'm not a murderer.

I'm not a psychopath.

You feel that when
you touch him too?

Look at me, bitch!

Do you feel it?

You feel how deep it is in him?

So deep the only way
out is death... or me.

Tanner.

Yeah, buddy?

You have anything
that'll play this?

Home... home movies?

Maybe.
Maybe just some stuff I shot.

Actually I do, but if
it's good, I want to keep it.

What you have here,
son, is very dangerous.

No.

I mean what you have here.

I once knew a boy like you who
was filled with same dark bile.

He traveled the world,
and he spread his hatred

to so many unsuspecting people.

His fury was misdirected,
and then a miracle.

In an inconspicuous place on
this Earth, an old farmhouse,

in a box locked away
in an attic,

he found something...
something old...

something older
than all of us... a purpose...

a purpose no man had ever
experienced... a potential.

Some things we're not meant to
understand, only to witness.

What you have in your hand
is nothing compared to what

he did during his time of hate.

Samuel.

The cage was locked,
and he could see

glimpses of what were inside.

Glimpses.

To unlock his full potential...
he needed a key.

The search for that key changed
his life, turned his spirit.

He knew if he could
help other people,

if he could help shield
them from predators like he

used to be, he'd find the key.

I have found the key.

It's you.

You're the key.

You're the key to your
salvation and mine and ours.

Will you do your part, Kyle?

I came with you because
I thought I loved you.

I thought I could help you,
but I don't think I can.

Mandy...

I want to leave.

Wait.

If I leave now, I'll
never come back.

I can't.

Not without seeing
my parents first.

In my craziest, most anxiety-filled
imagination of me...

in this situation,

I still wouldn't be here, Kyle.

And yet we are,
and you are still

talking about finishing this.

Look. You said you understood
how important this is...

that I get some kind
of closure with... that you

don't get with your dad.

That's when I
though I knew you.

How do I know that
you're not the person

that I've been hearing about?

You don't know
that I'm different?

I would have never
have guessed that you

would let yourself go there.

So no.

It surprised me.

It scared me.

I mean, I'm scared, OK?

Mandy.

I'm sorry.

Mandy, what I did was wrong.

OK?

I mean, good Lord it was wrong.

But I never intended
for them to kill anyone.

I mean, with a little
room to breathe,

the... just that idea that this
is even connected is insane.

I mean, that's absurd, right?

Don't.

Come on.

Am I going to get hurt, Kyle?

No.

Mandy, what happened
today at the house...

I'm... I shouldn't
have let you come.

I'm sorry.

Just... stay with me tonight.

OK?

I need you.

First off, I'm going
to ask you just to tell me

a little bit about your boys.

My boys were everything
to me... to Emmett too.

Just because we lost Ryan...
and in some ways, Kyle,

it doesn't mean that they
still aren't everything.

You just learn to carry on.

I'm sorry. I'm not...
I'm not good with my words.

I don't... I don't
know how to do this.

It's OK.

I think that's what I do.

I just carry on.

Do you think it was a good
idea to move Kyle to go and live

with your sister.

I still think it was
the right thing to do.

He might not have made
it if he had stayed.

That's so sad to say.

There was just so much...

There was too much.

I'm so sorry, Kyle.

It's all right.
We can stop.

I'm so sorry.

Hey.

I guess this went about
as expected?

I had dinner with dad
here a few years back.

It's not really how
I remembered it.

I didn't know that.
How was dad?

He seemed quiet Mr. Emmett Cole,
you know, older.

I need to go see him.

Can I shoot it?

As long as he don't
know you're there.

How are you feeling?

Like it was yesterday.

If it were yesterday?

I guess I'd be a better person.

Try to be more like
Ryan instead of...

always seeing him so different.

Kyle, that was the sheriff.

We need to talk
about a few things.

OK, Tanner.
This is it.

This is your money shot,
and I want to leave.

Mandy, I don't
think Kyle's ready yet.

I've got work to do.

Go in and feel him out.

I think you'll see he needs a
little more time, and so do I.

I'm not sure about that.

He tried to talk to him before
he came here, and... I mean,

the point is is that I'm
scared of where we are

and what we're doing.
I mean, aren't you?

I'm scared too, but
I came here to shoot this.

Yeah.

-You ready?
-Whatever.

Just pull the tarp
off and let's get this shot.

Is that...
Shit.

That's the one
Jordan had branded on him.

You really did do something
terrible, didn't you?

What?
Mandy, what?

Goddamn it, Kyle.
What the hell is that?

What the
fuck is that, Kyle?

Are you one of them?

No.

Mandy, listen to me.
What the hell is all this?

All right! Everybody knew what
was going on in Dooms Chapel.

All right?
Everybody!

Everybody knew about
all the secret bullshit

that was happening down there that
Jordan and Samuel were doing.

Everybody talked
about that, right?

-Yeah.
-Yes.

I'd had enough.

I was done with all the
stares and the glares and all

the comments that I heard make...
people making under their breath.

And I'd had enough, and I
went and asked for revenge.

And they... they did this to me.

And Jordan...
he did it to himself.

You remember that day.

I know you do.

I came home.
I... I... I was in shock.

I didn't... I didn't
go back to school.

And now all of this.

Mandy.
Mandy!

Get the hell away from me.

Kyle
was subjected to abuse.

And a video was fed into the new
video board at the football field.

There was a game.

So everything that happened

could be seen by... everyone.

Kyle had his clothes removed...

and he was bound up
with duct tape.

He was in the locker
room at the field.

And it appeared that feces
had been smeared on his body,

and he was crying.

The, the students
were taunting him,

and they were
encouraging him to...

Encouragement?

They were forcing
him to say that he was

responsible for Ryan's death.

You couldn't have
stopped him from going.

No matter what he told you,
we tried to keep him here.

Couldn't stop him
from leaving as a boy.

No reason we could
stop him as a man.

He's got his grandfather's
determination...

something neither me
or his brother had.

What are you guys doing up?

Tanner, where's Kyle?

Mandy, Kyle's gone.

And you just let him go?

There was no letting about it.

Well, if you aren't
going after your own son,

the sheriff should at
least know about his.

Emmett?

Sheriff.

No.

Emmett Cole.

We got to talk.

Something going on here.

Where are we?

Well, the
park's over there.

Saw mill that way.

Just over here right
past Perryman's Creek

is Dooms Chapel.

I guess we're right
in the middle of it.

It's up to you, brother.

Where you want to go?

Dooms Chapel.

Listen, Henry.

You ain't got to come.

I don't know what
happens after this.

Heart's beating in my
chest like a jackhammer.

I'm going to stick
with you, Kyle.

I know by now ain't nothing
usual about hanging out

with Kyle Cole.

All right.

That way.

Right there.

Right fucking there.
Did you see it?

Stay behind me, Kyle.

No. Henry!

Henry!
Shit!

Henry.

Henry?

Those woods, in just
two days, has taken

five of our sons and daughters.

Randy Curtis, Ricky Johnson,
Chester Johnson,

Vicky Street,
only six years old.

And now possibly young
Billy Vogler.

Whatever that abomination
that is out there is,

it is responsible for
taking our children from us.

It's decided
to call our town home...

and it is not welcome.

We didn't stay
here in Kaler Mills

to raise our sons and daughters
to be afraid to go outside

in their own home town.

We didn't work
our fingers bloody

building our livelihoods
to have it torn away

from us from the inside out.

All of you brothers and
sisters, all of you,

I call upon you to arm
and to gather yourself.

Come with us to
take our town back,

and send that animal to hell.

Henry.

Fuck. Fuck.

Henry!

God...

What possessed you?

What propels you?

What compels you to me?

What caused you so much
pain in here and in here?

Not God.

Not the Devil.

Not the spirits you sipped.

But the innocence in your souls.

There are those who need your
trust so they may betray it.

There are those who
prey upon your naiveté,

but this innocence you've
given me, then I've taken it.

And though it weighs
upon me,

it weighs...

like the lead of 10,000 bullets
lodged in my flesh.

I've taken it,
and it's set you free.

Hasn't it?

Hasn't it set you free?

You see this boy, my friends?

This boy came to me once...

just like you all did...

but he did not bring innocence.

That was long gone from him.

He brought hatred and guilt.

This boy killed his brother.

Shut up, Jordan!

Came to me with the blood
guilt that was so deep.

Its tentacles so wormed into
his young flesh and bone.

I could not deny him,
and we tried.

Didn't we try, Samuel?

He could've been with
us even here tonight.

But he fled before
I could help him.

What do you say, Kyle?

Too late for you to be saved?

You've all been
brainwashed by this crazy fuck.

He denies me.

Do you deny this?

You deny me, but
will you deny this?

Will he deny this?

Will he deny that
it is his own paper?

Will he deny that
it is his writing?

Did you not mark these own
souls with your pencil?

That may be my list...

but all this...
everyone that died,

that was you, and I'll
die and go to hell

before I let it get any worse.

You know what comes next.

Suzanna, come and sing
for us, child.

Come and sing for us.

Let it begin.

I'm going to
let you see, Kyle.

I'm going to
introduce you tonight.

This... this is
what killed Henry?

No.

You killed Henry.
No.

-You killed everybody else too.
-No. No. No.

You killed Henry.

Brandon Curtis.

Ricky Johnson.

Becky Johnson.

Miss Fulsome.

Sheriff McManus.

Emmett... Cole.

I will kill you,
you son of a bitch.

You hear me?

Mine...

His!

There he is.

There he is.

We best be going now.

Enjoy the show.

Goodbye, Kyle.

I will kill you.

I'm gonna do it.

Do your best, boy.

Like the man said, Kyle.

Do your best.

Samuel.

Samuel!

Everybody is getting two
of these here things.

Put one around your neck.

And if it goes out,
put the other one on.

Rule number one... don't
shoot the green glow sticks.

Nobody's getting hurt tonight.
Understood?

Yes, sir.

I want you men and women
to understand the severity

of the situation tonight.

Three young men... one
of them my own son...

is out in those woods.

If it was not for the urgency
required in finding these boys,

we would not be
walking out there

in the middle of the night with
a bunch of you armed civilians.

Do not take a shot unless
this thing is on top of you.

Am I clear?

Yes, sir.

Holy shit.

Everybody be careful.

Come on, Mandy.

Stick together.
Stay close.

Keep your eyes open.

Tilson, that one of you?

No, sir.
I think it came from behind us.

No.

Keep moving.

If your party fires
a shot, first thing,

let us know it was one of you
guys and not one of our boys.

We'll still meet
up at Reds Farm.

Yes, sir.
10-4.

OK.
Let's keep moving.

Everybody stay alert.

What... What is that?

Kyle?

Be careful.

No!

It's the boy.

Yeah, that's him.

I don't care what it is.
I'm finding my boy.

Yeah.
We found the Vogler boy.

Leaving Whitess here.
Whitess, stay here.

Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, guys.

What was that?

What the hell is that?

My god!
Who is that?

Hey, hey.
You guys see that thing?

Somebody help me up.

My god!

I see it.
It's over there, man.

My god!
God, fuck!

Fuck.
I don't want to do that.

What was it?
Did you see it?

Whitess?

Did you see it?

My God!

-God!
-Shit!

My God!

My belly hurts.

Tanner!

Quiet, girl.
Quiet.

Shut that damn light off.

Sheriff!

Sheriff!
God!

Get the hell out.

Kyle!

Good shot.

Be quiet.

It's still there.
It's still there.

Henry's dead.

It killed Henry.

It came for me.

It wants me.

Get the fuck up, Kyle.

You are going to look at
me when I tell you this.

Everyone was right.

This is your fault.

The accident, Jordan...

Goddamn it!
Look at that.

-I know it's my fault!
-Look at all of it!

You did that!

Henry, your friend... us.

You broke that.

But this is what
you wanted, right?

You wanted everyone dead.

And you, Tanner, did you get the
freak show that you wanted...

Haul your
ass back to the road.

I'm done watching
you do this, Jordan.

It's me now.
Just me.

God damn it, son.

Stop it.

It wasn't your fault.
It was never your fault.

Dad!

Dad!

God.
Dad!

Dad!

Dad? Dad, please.
Come on.

Come on, please.

Dad.
Dad.

I can't feel anything, Dad.

I... I don't know what to do.

I'm so sorry.

Come on!

It's me!
Come on!

I'm right here!

It's me!

I am the one
you should be be worried about.

It's mine!

You see?

What's the matter, Kyle?

What's done is done.

A change is a-comin'.

Soon and soon!

Hello, Mandy.

No. No.

No!

No!
Let go!

We have such wonderful
things to show you.
