"Women who
know basketball players."

You know I call it
that 'cause

ain't none
of them married.

Not one wife on
the show.

You saw it?
I did.

The crazy one.

She remind me of--

Ladies.

Top of the morning
to you, Markita?

How's everything?

I'm good.
Great.

Sheila.

Looking mighty
"grrr," girl.

"Grrr," yes.

How you doing, sir?

Good, if you need
coffee or tea,

just let Markita know,
she'll take care of you.

( woman )
Take your mail.

I'll take my mail-- are you
gonna get me my coffee?

Gavin, I don't
do coffee.

What do you mean you--
I've never done coffee.

So what do you do?

I mean, I hired
you for a reason.

You asked me to
remind you of your 10:00 a.m.

meeting with Makell Williams
from marketing

about your little
"Man Of The Year" thingie

that magazine did
last week.

Oh, that's good.

So this is me reminding
you of your 10:00 a.m.,

but it's been
pushed to 3:00.

No, no, no, no, 3:00 p.m.
is not good.

I have a late
lunch with Dre at 3:00 p.m.

No worries, I took
care of it.

She's coming at noon.

Jo, I'm not hungry
at noon, Jo.

You also asked me to send
your mama flowers.

You used the word "mama."
I did, okay.

I took your mother flowers
at the hospital

and she
wants to see you.

Jo, that's why I said
"send" flowers,

not "take,"
"send" flowers.

"Send," "take," you know,
it's like two different things.

She got the flowers.

I under--
okay, do me a favor.

Change my 3:00 p.m. back
to 10:00 a.m.

and get
my mother on the phone.

Did you modify
anything else?

Oh, yes,
there's one other thing.

You have a friend waiting for
you in your office.

She said her
name was Rochelle Davis.

Rochelle-- what?

Come with your
mama, come with your mama.

Boyz II Men up
in here?

Ash, what
do you think?

Uh, no.

Well, what do
you see?

Hey, mama.
Huh?

Hey, I like these.

You do?

You do?

You do?

Come on, let's go
find the other one.

All right.

Jeans and a Sunday hat.

Oh, my God.

Lord, please
don't let them come over here.

I swear I'll be good, I'll go
to church and everything.

My bad!
Dang, stupid.

Ah!

Whoa, what are
you wearing?

Look, please don't
tell Rochelle.

You know
my summer style.
I'll pay you!

I'll pay you!

No, you look.

Gavin...

What kind
of outfit is that?

Where's your neck?

Right?

For Halloween.

Yeah, we're having a
costume party

and I wanted to be ready,
you know.

I'm going retro.

You coming, right?

You can come, too.

It's gonna be called
Flashlight.

Hey, Gavin.

I found that other shoe.

It was in
the furniture section

for some other reason
or other.

Aren't you gonna introduce
me to your friends?

Ashley, Rochelle,
my mama.

Hi, Mrs. Miller.
Hi, ladies.

See, I told you you
wouldn't be the only one

school shopping here.

( laughing )

She is so funny.

She's such a joker, you need
to stop joking so much.

Joking about what?

Who wears platform
heels to high school?

I was just telling them
about the party we're having,

you know, the
Halloween party.

Flashlight.

Da-de-da-de-da-de-da-da-da

Ooh, boy,
you can't sing.

What flashlight party?

Nuh-uh, not in
my house.

Here, go try this on.

I'm not having a bunch of Bebe's
kids running wild

humping and grinding
all up in my house.

Look, no disrespect?

Teen pregnancy
is high enough without

my house and me contributing,
thank you very much.

Teen pregnancy?

Grinding and
humping, Mama?

Really?

It was really nice to
meet you, Mrs. Miller.

I know your
hands are full.

Bye, ladies.

Bye, Gavin.
What a herb.

Who's Herb?

Mama?

This don't fit.

Go try it on
again, try.

Here.

Hey.

Gavin.

How are you?

It's nice to see you.
Wow, hey.

Why don't you
have a seat, huh?

Uh, wow.

How have you been?

How did you find
me, I'm--

Wow, I haven't seen you since,
like high school.

Yeah.
Oh, I'm just visiting.

You aren't
upset with me?

For what?

Well--

<i>Gavin, your</i>
<i>mother's on line one.</i>

One minute, girl.

I'll be right with you.

Um, yes, Bobby?

<i>Bobby Jo.</i>

Okay, Bobby Jo.

I can call you
Bobby or Jo.

<i>No, Bobby Jo...</i>
<i>we've gone over this.</i>

Bobby Jo, right, okay.

<i>Oh, hello, hi.</i>

<i>Tell her I know</i>
<i>it's real.</i>

Can you tell my mother
that I'm actually

in with someone
and they're pretty special

and I'll call her right
back, okay?

<i>Oh, really?</i>

<i>Well, she said</i>
<i>it's urgent.</i>

Quick, you know what--
it's just like--

It's Mom.

<i>Hey, Mom,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>

Yeah, well...

the doctor says my
pressure's through the roof.

But you know what?

I feel fine.

Ma'am, I need you to lay
back down.

The doctor
hasn't released you.

What?

You have a blood clot
in your leg that is traveling.

It could cause a stroke
if it's not treated.

Okay, you know what,
you know what?

Until you get your degree
and become a doctor,

you come back and
tell me then.

It's too early in
the morning, Mom.

Can you just, like,
do what they say?

Just lay back
and relax.

Everything'll be fine.

<i>( mother )</i>
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that Pauletta called me</i>

and told me that Uncle was
riding his bike the other day

and got
hit by a truck?

What-- who-- oh-- Granny's
uncle Uncle?

That-- man, he's like 93.

<i>Is he still alive?</i>

Gavin Enzell Miller,

don't you dare
laugh at the fact

<i>that a 93-year-old man</i>

got hit by a truck.

Oh, we laughing at her?

We're having a
meeting here.

We're good, Mother--
Mother, listen.

What do you
expect him to do?

Stay stuck in that house,
trapped there until he dies?

<i>I hope you don't</i>
<i>expect that of me.</i>

No, Mom.

Mom.

No, hey.

Mom, no, no, no,
look, listen.

I'm not laugh-- I'm laughing
at something.

We were in here being-- I'm
with a friend and--

Yeah, no,
I'm not laughing at you.

Something else, yeah.

Yeah, well, you go keep kikiing
about something else.

I'm gonna
go see my uncle.

So, yeah, what I'll do,
Mom, I'll call Pauletta,

check in on Unc,

and when I do that,
I'll give you a call back, Mom.

That's what I'm gonna do because
I'm in a meeting.

Gavin.

<i>Mom, I said I'll check on</i>
<i>it, I'll check on it.</i>

Okay.

All right.

I'm so sorry.

How many eggs
you want?

( Georgia )
Hmm?

How many eggs
you want?

Every morning you
ask me the same question

and every morning the answer
is still the same,

so let me
set the record straight.

I'm gonna have two eggs for
the rest of my life, Gary.

Okay?

Two eggs?
Two eggs.

Always two,
it's always been two.

You want a little hot wing
with that egg?

You better stop.

Mmm, here it is
right there.

( boy )
Mama.

Mama!

The kids.

I don't know what you're
embarrassed by.

It took two eggs to
make the both of you.

And a hot wing.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

Oh, and just because it's
almost summer,

don't think
you're gonna be lounging around

and hanging out.

Mm-hmm.

Mama, what are you
talking about?

Your test.

You need to be studying.

Mm-hmm.

I don't, really.

Excuse me.

Get smart with your
studying, not with your mother.

Get smart.

Mama, I will pass
the test.

I promise.

And that's how it starts.

Ah-ah-ah-ah.

On a plate, sir.

Come here.

Muah.

If my lip
breaks out in a rash,

I'm calling Child
Protective Services.

( Georgia )
Oh, shut up.

I don't know where his lips
have been.

I can show you,
better not tell you.

Okay, stop.

Aren't you forgetting
someone?

No.

Gavin.

Wait up.

Come here.

( kissing )

Go on, baby.

Come on, man.

I ain't trying to be
waiting on you.

I don't even know why
I even stopped by, you know.

Talking about
you and I--

I really feel
bad about what happened.

I mean, I know I caused you
a lot of trouble and I--

I feel like
it was my fault.

I, um...

I never got to say
it, but...

I'm sorry.

But you're really busy,
so I'm gonna go.

You didn't deserve that.

Can I take you
to dinner?

Well, if
I can make it my treat.

Okay.

I'll be in town
'til Friday.

Call me.

Oh, wow.

We'll see you Tuesday.

Have a good day.

You again, Miss Miller?

You again, Nurse Reed?

Whatever.

Proceed.

Behave.

You behave.

You behave.
You behave.

You...
You behave.

Okay, hold up.

Not today.

Proceed.

Hi, how
are you today?

Hey, sweetie--
Can I get you anything

while you're waiting for
your guest?

Yes, I would
like a French connection

and a tequila sunrise with
a shot of Patron silver

and a splash of pineapple.

Thank you.
You got it.

All right.

( Dre )
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

So, so sorry... traffic
was crazy,

silly, quite honestly.

Wow, you
look absolutely exquisite.

Thank you.

Tell me again why you
do not have my kids.

Wow.

Because we're
BFFs, remember?

Wow.

What's up?

Stop, stupid.

Dang.

Whatever.

What is all of
this anyway?

Who you trying to
look cute for?

You know it's too hot
for all of this.

Nobody, shut up.

What's up, Dre?

So is this it?

Oh, yeah.

Look, I can't say my
dad is the most stylish brother.

Anything is better
than this.

'Sup?

What?

Dang.

But you know you look
good, right?

Just trying to keep
up with the "Man Of The Year,"

that's all.

Congratulations,
by the way.
Thank you.

This is--
It's nice.

It's pretty impressive.

You know I don't really
care much

for all that kind
of stuff,

but I can tell you,
it does help with business.

I did a blog for
the magazine.

Actually, they
want me to write an article,

write more of a blog,
actually, for it, so...

Wow, okay.

I don't know, I'm really
thinking about

turning some of that stuff
into a book.

As you should.
Yeah.

"The Adventures
of Gavin Miller."

That's a story
for sure.
It is, it is.

I've been thinking a
lot about high school lately.

Really?

Yeah.

Why is that?

Stop, stop.

Oh, you
get on my nerves.

I can't believe you got me up
here at school

on a Saturday.

Don't trip,
it's only for an hour.

Well, I told Thor to meet
us up here.

What you
do that for?

'Cause it's boring.

All right, well, you be the one
to tell my mama

why I didn't
get into Morehouse.

What?

Boy, you could pass that test
with your eyes closed.

Stop it.

You're gonna pass
the test.

Don't worry
about it, all right?

All right.

What's up?

Look at your cousin,
what's wrong with him?

Come on, it's a
public place.

Oh, God.

Mo.

Mo!

What, fool?

Can't you see I'm busy?

I thought you were on
house arrest.

And I thought
you were supposed to stay

out my business, Dre.

The future president of
the United States,

ladies and gentlemen.

Hey, check this
out, remix.

You

You got a disease

And you say it's
just a rash

But you got it
up your ass

Oh baby you

( woman )
Hey, Dre.

What's up?
What?

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, these are so cute,
your overalls.

So what's up?

You taking dance, too?

Yeah, you?

Yeah.

Okay.
Let's go.

I ain't dealing with
these herbs.

Oh, wait a minute.

When did y'all get
to be friends?

We're not.

Well, she can be
friends with me.

Word?
What's up, girl?

Dang, you smell good.

Stop, don't play.

So um...

I'll call you later.

I guess.

I love the one-strap thing,
that's so cute.

Did she say
anything about me?

I don't know.

Why don't you go
ask her yourself?

No, it's cool.

You need to be hanging out
with some girls anyways.

If you don't want me
around, you can just say so.

Girl, stop playing.

You know that's not
what I'm saying.

What's up with
you today anyway?

Nothing.

Hey, so I've been thinking
about it, right?

And it's time for you
to hook me up

with your
fine-ass sister Natalie.

Natalie?

Boy, please, you
tripping.

You couldn't get
with Natalie if she had one eye,

a wooden leg
and a kickstand.

Oh, he got you.

( woman )
Gavin!

Are you serious?

What's up?

Okay, a little
deep, I get it, I get it.

I'll come up.

I'll lighten that.

How's your mom?

My mom is good.

She's doing okay, I'm
gonna see her later,

thank you for asking.

Yes, for
the lady, please.

Enjoy.
Wow.

You remembered.

Of course I did.

Cheers.

Cheers.

What?

I had someone stop past
my office today.

Okay.

Who was that?

Rochelle Davis.

Yeah.

You knew that was
gonna happen.

Yeah, well.

You sure you
want to do that?

Do what, I haven't said
anything yet.

I'm just saying, you
wouldn't have brought it up

if you weren't
trying to explore it.

Blogging, reminiscing.

I'm just taking the girl
to dinner.

I'm not marrying her.

I'm waiting on you.

Whatever.

Anyway.
Right.

Listen, just don't call
on the BFF

to come
pick up the pieces.

Okay.
People don't change.

( school bell ringing )

Yo, where'd Gavin go?

I don't know.

He not
even in here.

He got me up here
on a Saturday.

I'm not
even taking this test.

You should just
take it.

And then next year, all
you gotta do

is take four classes.

Why do you
think I'm here?

Oh, my God.

Thor.

Why is he here?

Who, Rasheed?

He's cool.

Hey, let's get this
show on the road.

Time is money.

Well, I guess you ain't
got no time

'cause you sure
as hell ain't got no money.

You need to pull your
shoes up.

On top of
that, you need to give

Fred Sanford back his
toughskins.

You expecting a flood?

Man, don't worry
about it.

At least your
mama wasn't complaining

when they was down around my
ankles last night.

And who
told your big ass

to wear a striped
shirt anyway?

Over there looking
like a big ass circus tent.

( laughing )

Man, shut up,
just wait.

Hey look,
your mama's so poor,

I saw her at the 99 cent store
the other day

complaining about
higher prices.

Ha, ha, ha!

Wahh-wahh,
man, that was whack.

Hey man, why your mama named
you Thor anyway?

What's your
brother name, He-Man?

All right, all right,
settle down.

I like your hair
down like that.

I mean, you look pretty.

Dre.

( laughing )

You got dissed,
homey.

Let it go.

Here man, let me help
you pick your face

up off the ground.

Man, stop, stop
playing.

You look pretty,
Dre.

You usually look like a
boy, and I like boys,

but today you look
like a girl,

and I like girls,

so I guess I like
you, too.

Get slapped.

Ooh-hoo-hoo!

Get slapped.

I'm turning back
into a man, Rasheed!

Am I pretty now?

Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey...

...Don't sit here.

Take these.

Rochelle.

Hey.

Rochelle.

Hey, I didn't know you was
taking this test.

Why would you?

( bell ringing )

There's an old saying.

That "Youth is wasted
on the young."

Don't let
that be the truth.

You all need to be preparing
for college now.

Because after
high school, time flies

and before you
know it,

you'll have a full-time job
that doesn't hardly pay enough,

you'll have a ridiculous
amount of bills,

kids and a wife

will suck even
more money out of you.

Rochelle!

And you'll wonder where
your dreams went at all.

Hey, Rochelle!

What?

You looking real
stupid right now.

I'm out.

Hey, where you going?

Hey, Dre.

Hold up.

Wait!

Wait!

Does anyone else feel
compelled to take Saturday off?

( Georgia )
I need help and
you know that.

These boys are not free.

( Gary )
Ugh.

Stop all that
noise, man.

Ain't nothing out there.

I been looking.

Shoot, this world...

( Gavin )
Home wasn't quite
home sweet home.

How many times
we gotta go over that?

Why you gotta keep--
I need help, Gary.

Kids ain't free.

I mean, you know, Isaiah's
my responsibility, okay?

Gavin, you know...

you need to talk
to his daddy.

Excuse the hell
out of me.

Come on, baby.
No, no, no, no.

Excuse the hell
out of me.

Excuse the
hell out of me.

So I guess I shouldn't be
taking care of your broke ass.

No, let's be real, you want
to keep it real?

You want to
keep it real?

'Cause Isaiah's your son
and Gavin is mine,

so I'm
gonna keep it real.

I mean, after all, you got a
mama and you got a daddy

and I'm not your wife,

so I guess I shouldn't
be taking care of you either.

Am I right?

And for what?

So you can go out
there and try to find yourself

while the rest of
the world works?

Huh?

Playing second fiddle
in, of all places, "The Keg"

in a band that ain't
going nowhere.

How you know
where we're going, Georgia?

I said it, in a band that
ain't going nowhere.

Why you say things
like that to me?

Now all of a sudden--
You know what?

Now all of a sudden, Gavin
is not your responsibility.

Well, check this out.

You knew it was a
package deal.

You knew it
from the very beginning.

You knew it coming in here,
and I'm sorry,

I mean, not just coming
in here, coming in my home,

through my door in my house
that I pay for

and now
you want to tell me

that Gavin is not my
responsibility.

Well, check this out.

You know what?

You can get to stepping.

That's right.
Come on, come on--

Get off me!

No, fuck you, get off me!

Gavin, Gavin,
Gavin, Gavin!

Gavin, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

You a man now, boy, you
a man now?

Stop, sit down, Gary.

You better keep your
hands off my mama.

You what?
Stop, stop.

Boy, you lucky I'm not
in my right mind.

I'll whoop your
ass, boy.

Gary, sit down.
You better sit--

You know what, you
know what?

Stop, stop, stop it--
Gary, sit down.

I know when I'm
not wanted.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, Gavin, stop, stop.

Gavin!

Stop.

Stop.

It's okay.

Just calm down.

So that's it?

Everything's cool now?

You're just gonna
let him stay?

It's complicated.

It's complicated, you
don't understand.

Let me handle it.

I'll make it right.

Let me handle it.

I understand.

Now you see this,
right here?

My son.

My baby.

( sobbing )

( knocking )

( knocking )

Oh God.

You're kidding, right?

What?

Hey, can I crash?

You know my mama don't
want no boys sleeping over.

We've been best friends
since kindergarten.

Your mama know me.

I'll leave
before she wake up.

( door closing )

Shh!

Man.

Thanks.

What's the matter?

Nothing, just...

thinking.

Nothing or are you
just thinking?

My mama and Gary got into
another fight

and I jumped in.

She took up for him
after he said

I wasn't
his responsibility.

Why would she
do that?

He didn't say that.

Look, I heard him
say it.

Well, were they drinking?

What you think?

You already know
he was.

Then he didn't
mean it.

I mean, people say all
kind of stuff when they drunk.

He meant it.

You know what, I don't
even care,

I can't
stand him anyway.

I didn't tell anyone
I already took the exit exam

and passed it.

I don't even have to do
senior year.

I'm ready to
just graduate early

and just bounce already.

What?

That scholarship to
Morehouse only requires me

to pass the exit exam.

I don't even have to take
the aptitude test.

But you're still
taking it?

Yeah.

For what?

For fun?

I guess.

Oh, God, you're such
a herb.

I don't know.

I'm just buying time.

I'm only here for
you anyways.

'Cause I know that when we
go to college,

we gonna
lose each other.

Nuh-uh.

Dre, you're going
to UCLA.

I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

( footsteps )

Hurry!

Get in there.

No, get in the closet.

Wait!

Hey, you know what?

I'm gonna
just leave, 'cause--

No.

I don't want you to
get in trouble.

No, stay.

Get some sleep.

All right.

On this side, though.
On this side.

She a skizza.

No boys in here.

She ain't got no
butt anyway.

Miss, can I go to
the bathroom?

Please?
Go ahead.

Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

Hit the music on
your way out.

Yes, ma'am.

( music blasting )

Ladies, that's
enough warm-up.

I want to see
what you got.

First positions, please.

Can I
be in front?

Of course.

Five, six, seven, eight.

One, two.

Very nice.

Three, four, five,

six, seven, eight, one--

Every rehearsal should
be treated

like you were
on stage at Carnegie Hall.

Five, six, seven.

Rochelle, really?

Looking very sloppy.

Four, five.

Beautiful, nice arms.

Seven, eight,
one, two.

Nice pique turns,
Andrea.

Very nice, excellent.

Six, seven, eight.

One, two.

Good job.

Four, five, six,
seven, eight.

No lazy hands.

One, two.

Very, very nice,
ladies, good job.

I'm back,
what'd I miss?

( woman )
Everything.

Cool.

( Rochelle )
My solo was good.

( woman )
You did good.

Thank you.

She can't even
do a split.

I know.

( woman )
Your friend ghetto,
let's go, girl.

Thank you,
Ms. Harris.

Yeah, but none of this
in my class, okay?

Call me, call me.
Bye, girls.

Hoo hoo, Cherish, baby.

Hey, let me get
your number.

No.
Wait.

Hello, come on.

No?

Hoo hoo, damn.

Dre, what up?

Hey, that was dope.

Where'd you learn to do
all them turns and stuff?

Goodbye, I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

( woman )
Bye, Ms. Harris.

And that's fresh.

Thanks.

You know the show is
next week, right?

You nervous?

Kind of.

Look, Gavin came to my house
last night, right?

Like 2:00
in the morning.

Word?
Yeah.

I knew
something had to be wrong.

He said his mom...

Hey.
...and Gary--

Mind if I talk to
Dre for a minute?

Go ahead.

Alone.

You gonna be outside?

Yeah.

Old fake
ass Wonder Woman.

Hey, so.

I was just wanting to
ask you something.

I mean, I know we're not
the best of friends,

but we cool, right?

What you getting at?

Well, I was just
wondering.

Are you and Gavin--

Are you guys like
a thing?

Are y'all just friends?

I mean, I know you guys
are friends,

but I just
thought that I'd come to you

and ask, like,
you know,

'cause I don't want to step
on anybody's toes or anything.

But, um...

Why do you care?

I mean, what's up with you
and my cousin Maurice?

I don't
want to go out with Mo.

I mean, Gavin, he's always,
you know, flirting

and he's cute,
and we cool, so...

So I don't really
think it's any of your business.

You know what?

I told you not to try
and ask her.

You know
she likes him.

Why you think she always
running up behind him?

You were right.
I know.

He's fair game.

You know, you better off
with Maurice anyway.

I'm telling you,
don't mess with that herb.

He's not a herb.
He is a herb!

He can't dress,
he's goofy,

he doesn't have a job
and he doesn't have a car.

What?

Hold up, you got
it twisted.

Gavin got like a 2000 on
his SATs

and will probably
skip senior year altogether.

He don't work 'cause his
mama want him

to focus on school.

And don't worry
about him not having a car.

You ain't got no car.

He's still a loser.

You know what?

I'm gonna give
you a pass.

I'll meet you outside.

Hold up, I'm coming.

Listen, don't
say I ain't ask you.

Your loss.

And most important,
everyone please remain qui-et.

Thank you.

That means no talking.

No note passing.

No party planning.

No nothing.

Thank you.

( loud thudding )

Whoa, I'm here,
I'm here!

This is not a rest
home, sir.

You may want to
try reading your book sometime.

I'm afraid osmosis isn't gonna
work in this case.

Upton Sinclair's
"The Jungle."

A very interesting
read about child labor

laws in the 1900s.

A little beyond your realm
of understanding,

don't you think?

Actually, child-labor laws
didn't even exist

before "The Jungle."

Sinclair's book
brought attention not only

to the maiming
of children,

which was commonplace
in the meatpacking plants,

but it also shed a light on
the mistreatment of

impoverished
workers in general,

prompting legislation to be
passed implementing

a federal minimum wage

and implementing
age restrictions on employers.

But I guess that's what you
meant, right, Mr. Katz?

Try getting some rest
at night, Gavin.

Who knows what you might
learn if you actually tried?

Put the book away.

This is a timed test.

I'll be watching.

( woman )
So?

Yeah, I'm gonna
be there.

Okay, good.

Who else coming?

I'mma be there.

Oh, okay.

You trying
to play me, Sam?

What's up, Dre?

Hey.

Ew, stank.

You coming to my party?

I don't know yet.

Okay, I see I need
to call you.

Call me.

Bye, Thor.

Why you such a whore?

Hey, she came up to me.

What's up with you?

Nothing.

Okay.

What's up, Dre?

So anyways.

So like I was saying
earlier, right?

Apparently his mom and
Gary got into it

and they was--

What?

Don't you
see I'm talking, dang?

My bad.

One thing, though,
real quick.

What is it?

They're having
a dance over--

I mean, they're having
a party over here.

Yeah, and...?

You going?

I don't know.

Is that it?

Look, I don't know.

I thought maybe we
could go together.

Uh, who brings
sand to the beach?

Why you always acting
like you all that?

All stank and shit, huh?

Look, I'm feeling
you, all right?

The party is B-Y-O-B

and I like to drink
to my taste

and not let anybody
make decisions for me.

You feel me?

Don't talk to
me like that.

You must got me twisted
with someone else, fool.

Whatever.

Later for you, buster.

I'm out.

Rasheed.

Look, I don't drink,

but maybe you can
dance with me.

A slow one so I can
feel on your booty?

Don't push it.

Oh, that's what I'm
talking about.

You old fake ass
Christopher Williams.

Hey, you gotta show
'em who's boss.

Use that lightskinnedness
to your benefit.

What?

Oh, you
like it rough, huh, Dre?

Whatever.

Listen, so Gavin's over
my house, right?

Telling me how his
mom and Gary were fighting,

he jumped in, his mom ends up
taking up for Gary

after he said that
he wasn't his responsibility

or his daddy,

totally stabbing G in
the back, right?

Word?
Yeah, so check it.

He's at my house and he's
all upset

telling me how he wants to
graduate from school early

and go to college,
I mean...

Look, long story short.

Too late.
What?

You get on my nerves.

Listen.

So I go to give
him a hug, right?

And y'all did it.

Ooh, I know y'all
did it.

And that fool
didn't tell me shit neither.

No, stupid, we didn't
do it.

Holding out.
Ahh, you get on my nerves.

Listen!

He kissed me.

Oh, well,
there you go right there.

What more do you need?

What's the problem?

What else happened?

Nothing.

Nothing!

All right, he was feeling
on my titties

and my mom came to
the door--

Oh snap, G got to rub
on your titties?

What you mean
"got to"?

Ooh, I knew I shouldn't have
told you, stupid.

Look, I
was just playing.

I don't know what
to do.

Just tell
him how you feel.

You think I should?

Yeah.

( Dre )
"We've been friends for some
time, I mean,

and I was thinking--"

No, you can't
start out like that, Dre.

Everybody starts out
like that.

"What up?

You wanna be
with me or not?"

Shit, that's too harsh.

He'll think I'm
a bitch.

"I love you."

"I love you?"

Come on, Dre, you can't--
( Gavin )
Dre!

Where you been, girl?

I been looking
for you all day.

I got my test back.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey, I passed my test.

Good for you.

So how's everything
with your moms?

Fine, I guess.

She called us up making
it up to me on the strength

by taking us shopping at the
Slawson swap meet this weekend.

Word?

Well, praise God,

I mean, something
good gonna come out of it.

What you trying to say?

Nothing.

What?

So you coming to the party?

You know we gotta
celebrate.

I don't know.

You didn't ask me.

Girl, come on with
all of that.

You want me to
pick you up?

With what car?

Your mom buying you a car
at the swap meet, too?

Thor gonna take us.

Well, all right, I mean,
yeah, I'll do it.

You better not
flake out, either.

I'm not.

So I wanted to talk to you
about the other night.

Me, too.

You can go--
Oh, you go--

No, go ahead, go ahead.

So you know you're
my girl, right?

You're always
there for me.

And that's dope,
for real.

Like, I don't know what
happened the other night

but I never
saw you like,

like a girl until
the other night.

It was so weird.

When did you get
that banging body?

I must have slept.

What I'm trying to say is,
I know it was a mistake.

I shouldn't have got
at you like that.

Like what?

I shouldn't have kissed
you, all right?

I apologize and I
just don't want to lose you.

You're my best friend,
so I'm sorry.

Will you forgive me?

Yeah, sure.

All right, cool.

So what did you want
to say?

Same thing,
you said it.

Well, you said you wanted
to talk to me, too.

What did you want
to say, Dre?

Nothing, you said it.

Look, I--

I forgot I can't go.

I gotta go somewhere
with my sister.

No, wait!

We was just up front.

Hey, we coming to
get you still.

So be ready!

( woman )
Natalie?

Andrea?

Who's that?

It's me, Mama, Dre.

Okay.

Hi, baby.

I gotta pee!

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah.

Okay, I'll be out here.

( sobbing )

( singing )

Dre.

Andrea!

Ugh!

What?

Don't quit your day job.

Oh, my goodness.
Whatever.

Yanay called.

Well, I'm
being dark right now.

Hold my calls.

Oh, okay...

but Gavin called.

Huh?

Gavin called.

Why'd you tell
him we had to go somewhere?

Why didn't
you give me the phone?

Because I was on
the phone

and I thought you
were being dark right now.

What did he say?

You didn't tell him we
didn't have to go nowhere,

did you?
Yes.

He said to tell you
they're on the way.

I told him
I wasn't going.

Like I care.

Ooh, thank you, I'm
borrowing this.

Get on my nerves, dang.

All right, Dre.

Look, he's on his way.

Pull it together, you
got this, come on.

You can do this.

Okay.

Now you know
what they say the best cure

for a broken heart
is, right?

Revenge.

But I
don't want revenge.

That's really cute.

That is really cute.

Yes, you do, honey.

Let's get it together.

You are my little
sister, okay?

Need I say more?

You got to represent.

Come on now, we gonna get
you right,

we are
gonna hook you up.

Yeah, it's gonna take
a little work.

All right,
it's gonna take a lot of work,

but you gonna be fly
tonight, okay?

I'm not letting
you go out like that.

Oh, no.

( knocking )

Who is it?

Gavin.

Hi, honey.

Hey, Mrs. Devine.
How you doing, come on in.

Look how big you are.

How come you don't come
to see me anymore?

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm
gonna come back.

I'm gonna come
see you more often.

All right, you better.

Andrea, Gavin is here.

I like that shirt.

Thank you.
She's coming.

Hey, Gavin.

Okay, Dre, stop playing
and hurry up.

Come on!

She right behind me.

Uh-uh.

What-- what you up to?
What do you mean?

Look at all you was
doing coming down those stairs.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I don't know what you're
talking about.

Have a good time.

Bye!

Look at you,
you did that?

I did good, right?

Yes, you did.

She looks pretty.

Well, it's my sister, you
know I'm gonna come through.

Gavin.
Hey, Rochelle.

You look good.
You look good, too.

Wanna dance?

Why you always tripping
on me, huh?

Embarrassing me
in front of my boys.

What's up with that?

If I made it
easy, you wouldn't want it.

How else I'm supposed to
know you're for real?

Oh, so you want me to act
like the crutch or something?

What's wrong with that?

So what's up,
you still on your boy

or are you ready to move on
to bigger and better things?

Everybody can see
it, Dre.

It ain't no secret.

He the only one that
don't know...

or don't care.

Word.

We're just friends.

Slow down, mama.

I don't like to carry
you home.

See, my party is dope.

Thank you for bringing
the alcohol.
I got you, I got the ID.

I know, we're pretty good.
( Mo ) Woo woo!

Yeah.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, Mo, don't be coming
up in here

starting no shit tonight,
all right?

Man, ain't nobody about
to start nothing.

Yeah, right.

You always
starting shit.

Man, look,
quit playing, Yinay.

No, it's Yanay.

Don't start no shit.

Yo, where's
Rochelle at, Yanay?

I don't know where
she is.

Mo, I'm not
playing, come on--

Yo!

Whatever, punk.

Hey, Rochelle!

Shit.

Ashley, come on.

Rochelle!

Hey yo, Dice,
there she go right there.

I'd be
calling the police.

None of them fools
got heat.

It's all right,
baby, I got it.

What's up, fool--
Why you on my girl?

You need to kick
back, man.

Quit tripping, Mo.

What's up?

Nah, move, Dre.

What you want,
a slanga?

We can go right now.

What's up?
( man )
Man, hold up, homey.

Watch out, homey.

( Mo )
Man, that's my team, boy.

No, what you need to do
is get your girl.

She the one hanging
all over Gavin's nutsack.

No, you didn't, you--
Oh, you-- You wasn't?

You wasn't?

Nah, baby, listen,

he just asked me
to dance, so what's up?

Come on, man, they
was just dancing.

Yo, watch out, man, watch
out, man, watch out.

Scandalous.

Come on.

You lucky I'm fresh
out, Peewee.

You better watch
your back.

Man, whatever, you ain't
gonna do nothing.

That's why I'm gonna tell
auntie Shannon

you was out
here acting a fool.

Man, go and tell Auntie.

And matter of fact, why
don't you tell her

you was over
here getting pissy drunk

and being fresh while
you snitching?

Whatever.

She gonna whip your ass
is what she gonna do.

Go on, walk over there and walk
two feet in front of me.

Can't believe you, man.

Leave you alone
for a second.

Still?

Man, look, go.

Downstairs.

Come on, Junior.

Don't even
talk to me right now, Dre.

I just saved your ass from
getting whooped.

Look, you
didn't save me from shit.

I didn't?

Oh, I didn't, Gavin?

Ain't nobody scared
of him.

Let's just bounce,
come on, man.

Whatever.

If it wasn't for you and that
fake-ass bitch,

it wouldn't
have happened anyway.

Where she at now, huh?

You see
her, 'cause I don't.

I know
you ain't talking.

I saw you over there putting on
a show for everybody,

shaking your monkey
for the whole world to see.

Y'all might as well have been
just humping

right there
on the dance floor.

And since when
did you start drinking anyway?

Don't worry about me and what
I'm doing with my monkey.

I'm not.

Whatever.

Hey Dre, you okay?

She's fine, partner.

Don't speak for me.

Man, let them just
talk it out.

You need a ride home?

No, she don't need
no ride home, bro.

Just keep it pushing.

( woman )
Dre, come on, baby.

I said don't speak for
me, I don't need you.

Dre, come on.
Stop grabbing me.

No, 'cause you want to try
to play all protective now.

What, you jealous?

Hmm?

Well, we're
just friends, remember?

Oh, you jealous now
'cause somebody's

paying me
some attention, huh?

Now you want to notice
I exist?

Hey Dre, don't
do this here.

Why not?

I'm already saying what
everybody else

thinks anyway, right?

I mean, come on.

We've been
friends forever, Gavin.

I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

Taking up for you
while these fools talked about

your stupid ass jokes
and your whack ass gear.

I'm the one who let you
in in the middle of the night

knowing my mama would
kill me.

When your mama
and stupid ass step daddy

was fighting all
the goddamn time.

Everybody here
thinks you're a scrub.

Everybody.

I saw past that and I
loved you anyway.

Nah, she'll be fine.

Let her go.

( gunshots )

( screaming )

Call 9-1-1,
call 9-1-1!

Rasheed!

( Thor )
Is he okay?

( woman )
Dre.

Oh my--

Hey, go get help!

Call 9-1-1!

( crying )

Oh, my God!

Damn, Maurice.

Come on, man!

Come on, man, stay
with me!

( man )
They on their way.

( Dre )
Oh, my God...

( crying )

( Georgia )
And that's when he came
running home screaming about

"anus beef, anus beef."

And I told him, no,
baby, it's "angus beef."

Ain't no such thing
as ass beef.

But if a man
could have an ass beef,

I'd marry him in a heartbeat,
yes, I would.

That's why
I'm not married now.

Let me tell you something.

I'm done
with the marriage thing.

Are you married?

( knocking )
We never even talked about--

I told you, I don't want
any of that nasty-ass Jell-O

and I don't have to pee.

( Gavin )
It's me, mother.

Please don't throw
anything, okay?

Oh...
How are you?

Hi, baby, oh....

Come to say hi.

And thank you for the
flowers, but you know what--

Hey Glenn, how you
doing over there?

Your dyke assistant
already sent me--

What?
Flowers.

You don't need to, 'cause
the lady already brought 'em.

Why you calling her
a dyke, ma, why--

You don't say that.

'Cause she is
a dyke.

Everybody's so politically
correct these days.

Everyone's so sensitive.

You gotta call
orientals Asians,

you gotta call
the Mexicans Latinos.

Mother, do you want
somebody calling you colored?

Or negro?

I am a colored negro.

Look at this,
look at this color.

I'm a mocha-chocha-latta
ya-ya.

Creole Lady Marmalade.

I can't come
to visit my mama

without you talking
crazy, huh?

Oh, oh, please tell me you
checked on Uncle.

Oh yeah,
I did, I did.

He's doing quite well.

They're taking him to
a convalescent home.

Amazingly enough, he just
broke his wrist,

so he's okay.

So why they taking
him to a convalescent home

if he just broke
his wrist?

Why they want
to put him in there for that?

You know what, they're trying
to kill him, that's all.

They're trying to get
rid of him

so they don't
have to be responsible,

that's all it is.

He's 93 and he doesn't
want to be

so they're just gonna let him
go there to die.

You're just so positive,
Ma, woo!

Could you
get more positive?

He's gonna be fine.

Look at you, looking all
cute with your little suit on.

Looking all snazzy, where
you going?

Just got off of work, went
and had lunch with Dre.

She said "hi," by the way.

Oh, really, what'd you
tell her?

I told her you were good.

I told her you
were doing fine.

And you didn't tell her I
was in the hospital

with a blood clot
in my leg

and about ready to die?

Well, Mama, I didn't tell
her you were sick.

You said you were fine,
why would I tell her that?

Anyway... how is she?

She's doing good, she's...

you know, she's hanging
in there, she's fine.

Mm-hmm.

You should marry
that girl.

Mom, we're just
friends, I keep telling you--

Gavin Enzell Miller,

for someone I raised to
be so smart, you are so stupid.

Okay, Ma.

You're supposed to marry
your best friend.

And let me tell
you something.

Yes.

You have never had
a friend as good as Andrea.

Name one,
huh, who's been with you

from back then
to now?

Hmm?

Yeah, someone's quiet now.
Okay, look.

Mom, Dre isn't
interested in me, okay?

Actually, I'm gonna go meet
a friend from high school, so...

Who?

Ma, you wouldn't know
if I told you, so...

Honey, I don't
mean to be rude,

but you weren't that
popular in high school,

so I
know all your friends.

Who?

Rochelle Davis.

Hmm.

See, that's exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

I'll call you later.
Okay.

I'll visit you,
all right?
Okay.

All right, take care
of yourself.
Okay, bye, stupid.

I love you.
I love you too, stupid.

That's my son...

Stupid.

What's up, Mr. Michaels,
how's everything?

How you doing,
Mr. Miller?

Great, great, great,
excellent.

What are you having, sir?

I am going to take a Jack
and Coke to start.

How's everything been?
Good, yourself?

Good, I'm excellent,
excellent.

Excellent.

Thank you,
sir, appreciate it.

Cheers to everyone.

Cheers.
Indeed.

( phone ringing )

Oh, man.

Thank you.

Mr. Miller?

Yeah, sir?

Your guest,
Ms. Davis, called.

She won't be able to
meet you this evening.

She called the restaurant?

Yes, a little while ago.

She-- she called here.

Yes.

Why would she do that?

She has my number.

I'm sorry, I don't know.

Okay, come on, man,
me and you, man to man.

Sir?

If you're a chick, right,

and you got this
dude that you have been

seeking out for years,

you sought
after him and you have--

you have his number.

Why would you--

You know, just call, say
you can't make it.

Why would,
why would you not call?

( Dre )
Guilt.

That's what I was
looking for.

Guilt.

Guilt.

He's guilty.

What do you want, Dre?

Why'd you come here?

You want to rub
it in my face?

What, are you
stalking me now?

Maybe a little
bit of both...

and surely you cannot
be surprised.

Dre, come on.

Ask me a whole
bunch of questions.

I had five drinks.

Oh.

Okay.

I don't know, I guess I'm
just like Mike Jones.

Back then,
they didn't want me.

They still don't
want me, Dre.

All the fame and success.

It's like I'm still
the same me,

same scrub I was
in high school.

Same package.

I guess just shined
up a little bit,

made it a little better,
you know.

I don't know what
I was thinking, though.

I kept-- I don't
even like her.

I was just wondering, like,
if I could show her.

You know what?

You don't owe
her any explanation.

And you definitely don't
have to apologize

for being who you are.

That's right.
That's right.

That's right, girl.
Whoa!

Wow, okay.

All right, can we--

Check, please.

Thank you.

No, wait.

Just lean, lean.

No, no, not that way,
the other way.

Lean the other way.

There you go, there
you go.

Oh, that's me, Dre.

Come on, Dre.

Me and you, Dre,
me and you, Dre.

It's me and you, Dre.

Yeah, me and you.

Wow, okay.

Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

I love you, Dre.
I know, I know.

I always loved you.
I know, I know.

Wow, you know
how long I've waited

to hear you say that,
but not with that breath?

Mm-hmm.

Walk me over here, Dre.

Oh.

Ow.

Well, it's about time
somebody got up.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, no, okay.

Listen, don't worry, I've
seen it all before

and then some.

What-- did we...

'Cause that's my shirt.

Did we?

Please don't tell
me you forgot.

Am I that-- was--

You don't remember?

What?
It was us, we--

you don't remember
under the sheets.

You don't remember having
your tongue in places--

Wow.

Ew... no!

No, we did not.

Girl, dang.

I had to bring your drunk
behind home last night...

I see.
...after you embarrassed me.

So where are your clothes?

Oh, they're in the
washing machine.

Yeah, you spilled all
your drinks on me.

Thank you very much.

It's starting to come
back to me now.

Yeah, I see, I see.

Oh wow,
it smells good.

It does, yeah,
I can cook.

You saved me again
last night.

Why did you do that?

That is what friends
do, isn't it?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What I said to you
last night on the couch...

when I told you
I love you.

Uh-huh.

I meant that.
Okay.

When I kissed you in
your room, I knew.

I just didn't have--

Whoo-hoo!

I heard she stood
him up the other night

and he got pissy drunk
in Uzone

and had
to get escorted out.

Of the restaurant?
Yes!

Girl, stop it.

But that's not how
the story ends.

Okay, tell it.

I saw them together
last night.

Are you kidding?
Mm-hmm.

And miss thing in
there, she mad.

Ladies, top
of the morning, Nadine.

Markita.

Hello, ladies,
how are you?

Good, good.

Rochelle is in
your office.

Give me a second,
then come get me.

Oh.

Okay.

I got permission, this
gonna be fun.

( Gavin humming )

Gavin.

I'm really sorry
about last night.

I, um...

I didn't know
what to do,

but I just couldn't leave
you like that, so--

Thank you.

Thank you.

Pardon me.
For what?

You know, if I explained
it to you,

you probably wouldn't
understand.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

a lot of work
to attend to today.

Hey.

Sorry to interrupt.

You're not interrupting,
my guest was just leaving.

Good.

Andrea's on line one.

Thank you, I'll take it.

Yes, baby, how are you?

Hold on for one
sec, please.

You're excused.

Don't you even want to
know why I'm here?

No.

<i>( Dre )</i>
<i>Was that Rochelle?</i>

<i>He was fair game,</i>
<i>but you lose.</i>

<i>Call me later, baby.</i>

What can I say?

Yes I will, darling.

I love you.

Have a good one.

Wait for it,
wait for it.

Oh.

Have a good day.

Bye.

We know it's
real, honey.

Too much.

Too much.

Miss thing!

She's overdressed for
the meal of the day.

That's all I'm
gonna say.

I'm just gonna put
it out there.

All right, ladies, let's
get back to work, okay?

We're dressed
appropriately.

That's how we get down.

I sing
doo-doo-doo

Yes, can you please cancel
all of my appointments?

I am leaving
for the day.

<i>( Bobby Jo )</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

( man )
Yo, G!

What's up, big boy?
I'm good, baby.

What's going on, man,
good to see you, man.

All right.

So, wow, where you
been, bro?

You know,
still around the way.

Yeah, I see.

You're looking good, man.

You're holding
it together.

No, man, that's
you, man.

Everything good?

Yeah, I can't complain, man,
I can't complain.

How's that beautiful little
friend of yours, Dre, man?

You know, I'll take her
off your hands

while you're bullshitting.

I see nothing's changed.

Well, you still
remember Dre, yeah?

She's-- she's totally
off-limits.

Okay.

What about that pretty
little assistant

you got back
there at the office?

Bobby Jo?

That's how
you found me, huh?

You know, I'm gonna wish
you luck on Bobby Jo.

You're on
your own on that one.

Really.

Well.

I don't know how they pick
"Man Of The Year," man,

but I really
must say, man,

that's a good look on you,
my dude.

Thanks man,
I appreciate it, I really do.

What do they give you,
like a gold watch

and two tickets to the
Poconos or something?

It doesn't work
that way.

( Gavin )
The things you never bother to
pay attention to in high school

mean the most when you
finally grow up.

Congratulations, Gavin,
on "Man Of The Year."

You are probably one of
the smartest people

I have ever met.

No lie, before I meet
with you

I catch up
on news headlines

just to see what you're
up to.

Is that right?

"Man Of The Year."

Wow.

Well, I have
to tell you, Gavin,

I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be broke

and not only that, I really
appreciate your soft side.

Really, really touched
my heart,

you supporting the nonprofit
for you, know, GSU,

protecting the kids in Haiti

and giving them moral
support and uplifting them.

I really appreciate it.

You're really, really
an amazing guy.
