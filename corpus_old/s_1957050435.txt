[tyres screech]

[handcuffs creak]

we've finished everything

on your agenda today.

Are you sure, Carol?

There's two minutes left
in the work day.

Seems a shame to waste it.

Pretty sure. Let's see...

We helped Miss Blumfeld
with her cat problem.

She's got a big heart,
but she just can't take home

all the stray kittens she finds.

Strange it took her a full year
to notice

they were actually leopards.

Well, she didn't know
they were growing so large.

She thought she was shrinking.

Typical Miss Blumfeld.

The Mountain Rangers
have been notified.

They'll bring them back
to the wild tomorrow morning.

All right. What's next?

We confiscated
Daisy "Kaboom" Lewis' cans

of extremely flammable liquid
disguised as leopard food.

Right, we should probably
label those properly

to avoid confusion.

Next, we finally ended
the 13-year acrobat strike.

They weren't very flexible

when it comes to bargaining.

And the last thing on the list,
we granted the use

of our banquet hall
to the Society For People

Who Believe
They're Old-Timey Pirates

No Matter How Many
Historians Argue Them.

Nice folks.

Yes, No-Beard and Peg Neck Wanda
pillaged our hearts.

-And that's everything.
-Mummy!

Madison.

Mr Mayor.

Um, hello, uh... Small Carol.

I love coming here.

Look, I'm Mayor Madison.

I'm making a new law

that every day
is free ice cream day.

Wait, what?
Who proposed that bill?

Ice cream trucks would be
out of business in a month.

She's just playing make-believe.

You know, using her imagination.

-[clock ticking]
-[Carol sighs]

She's pretending
a free ice cream bill

exists on your desk,
when, in reality, it doesn't.

[approaching footsteps]

Okay, Maddy and I are going out
to dinner now, Mayor Fleck.

Oh, Mummy, please,
I wanna stay with Mr Mayor.

You, my dear, have to eat.
And so do I.

Come on, let's go.

[phone rings]

First Deputy Mayor Carol Yea.

Oh, fantastic.

I'll speak with the Mayor
and get back to you morning.

Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

The Space Agency decided
Sinclair's old warehouse

is the right location to build

their new
mission control centre.

They want our city to host

the first
manned mission to Mars.

That means an 11.4 per cent
increase in jobs and tourism

and almost a 100 per cent
increase in rocket launches.

But what about the polls?

A lot of people are worried
a space program

in our city will be disruptive.

Give them free ice cream.

I'm not signing that bill.

We just have to get
everyone feeling

personally invested
in this mission.

Okay, you both get your wishes.

We will continue to work
and figure out

how to get this city
behind the Mars mission.

And you get to hang out here

-while you do homework.
-Yes.

Can I please use
your special mayor pen?

My mayor pen? Are you--

Is Small Carol
playing make-believe again?

run down the street

and get us some dinner.

Uh, Carol, wait,
you're leaving Small Carol here?

I've never minded anyone's...

Small Carols before.

I'll be right back.

Keep an eye on the mayor for me.

[quirky music]

[clears throat]

Please?

Uh, what would someone
in my position normally do here?

They would a hundred million
per cent give me

the special mayor pen
to do my homework.

That's an awfully
high percentage.

It happens a lot.

Well, okay.

I guess I can use my backup
special mayor pen this one time.

Thank you, Mr Mayor.

I love you.

Uh, yes, work is... good.


<i>â™ª Special mayor pen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Special mayor pen! â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Special mayor pen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Special mayor pen! â™ª</i>

But where is my backup
special mayor pen?

You have a lot of pens.

They're all special mayor pens.

Well, then why don't you use
one of these pens?


You're silly.


[can thuds in distance]

[leopard snarls]

Hmm. That's odd.

[alarm ringing]





[all screaming]

What's going on, Chief McCloud?

Apparently, a large group
of stray leopards found

cans of food inside,
which, for some reason,

were filled
with extremely flammable liquid

that got spread
all over City Hall.

[growls, sniffs]


-[alarm ringing]
-[growls]

My daughter and Mayor Fleck

are in his office
on the top floor.

Don't worry, Carol,
this isn't my first fire

and wild cat-related emergency.
We'll save them.

What's going on, Mr Mayor?

Well, Small Carol, apparently,

a good day's work has gone bad.

And who are those guys?

[man grunting, wailing]

Acrobats.



What's going on, Bob?

Apparently, the fire's herded
the leopards

towards the group of...
If you can believe this,

non-protesting acrobats

who ran for cover
inside the banquet room,

which was filled
with celebrating pirates

who mistook the acrobats for
the Royal Navy attacking them.

Argh, you mangy scoundrel.

your solid gold pendant.

[acrobats grunting]

Okay, this is a first for me.

Chief, it's utter chaos.

What are we gonna do?

The first thing is to gain
control the situation.

The leopards are keeping us
from entering.

And we can't blast hoses
at the fire

because there are
civilians and animals

running around everywhere.

We need everybody
and everything working together

in sync.

Call the station.

You know who's on call tonight.

[both gasp]
The Funky 46.


-Fire station.
-[Clemmons screams]

Sure, whatever, Clemmons.

[funky music]

[all whooping]

-[engine starts]
-[siren blaring]

[leopards growling]

[acrobats grunting]

What are we gonna do, Mr Mayor?

Let's try to do more work.

A good hard day's work
never hurt anyone.

We already tried that
three times.

It didn't help at all.

Oh, monkey bars.

Now, Small Carol,
I know this is scary,

but there's no need
for that language.

No, no, no,
like on a playground.

We can climb over
to that window. Watch.

Got it.

Thanks, Mr Mayor. Come on.


Now it's your turn.

[corn pops]

I don't think I could do that.

Silly. You're the mayor.

You can do anything
you want to do.

You're right.

The only thing stopping me
is me.


Whoa.



You did it!

I did.

I monkey barred.

Look. They're on
the window ledge. Madison!

Hi, Mummy.

Carol, I dislocated
both my shoulders.

-[sirens blaring]
-It's the Funky 46.

We'll get these cats

in the wild where they belong.

Hope you learned your lesson

about taking in strays,
Miss Blumfeld.

I certainly have,
Miss Blumfeld. Thank you.

Come along home, Fluffy.

Oh, listen to you purr.

How precious. Mwah!

<i>â™ª Got a truck

Shiver me timbers.

Maddy. I'm so glad you're okay.

Of course. I was with Mr Mayor.

Actually, it was you
who saved us, Mayor Madison.


Now, let's get back to work.

Are you serious?

I almost lost my daughter.

I know how important
work is to you, but my family

is the most
important thing to me.

When you worry
about someone you love,

your whole heart and mind
is with them.

I know you understand, Mr Mayor,

you worry about
this entire city,

which is like one big family.

We should all go home now,
thankful everyone is safe.

[all cheering]

Wait, that's it.

That's how we get the city
behind the Mars mission.

What? Have everyone yell at me?

No. We allow a citizen
to go up to Mars

and represent our city,
our family.

That's brilliant, Big Madison.

Yay. Let's get ice cream.

-Now that, I'll sign off on.
-[giggles]

But first, we'll need a proposal
to present the city council,

which will require a Fiscal Note

for the City Budget Office
to review.

There's a lot of paperwork...

[closing theme music]
