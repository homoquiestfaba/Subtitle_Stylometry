We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,

We wish you a merry Christmas
Hey! Wait a minute!

What?
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

Yeah, I think so. - Dude, Jewish
people don't celebrate Christmas!

What? - You're supposed
to sing Hanukkah songs!

Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,

Dreidel dreidel dreidel
If we had that-- stupid song.

Yeah, Hanukkah sucks.
Don't you oppress me, fat boy.

Don't call me fat, buttfucker.

Then don't belittle my
people you fuckin' fatass

Goddammit don't call me fat
you buttfuckin' sonofabitch!

What the-?

Behold my glory.
Holy shit, it's Jesus!

What are you doing
in South Park, Jesus?

I come seeking... retribution.

He's come to kill you
cuz you're Jewish, Kyle!

Oh, fuck! I'm sorry,
Jesus. Don't kill me.

May, fear not.
I love all My children.

Whew. - Tomorrow is my
birthday. Yet all is not right.

Your birthday is on Christmas?
That sucks, dude.

I must find a place
called "The Mall".

Well we can take you to the mall, Jesus.
Yeah! It's over this way.

Eugh! Goddammit, you stepped
on my foot you pigfucker.

Dude, don't say pigfucker
in front of Jesus.

Eh, fuck you.

Here we are Jesus, South Park
Mall. Who are you looking for?

Him! - Ho ho ho.
We meet again, Jesus.

You have blemished the meaning of
Christmas for the last time, Kringle!

I bring happiness and love
to children all over the world.

Christmas is for
celebrating my birth!

Christmas is for giving!

I'm here to put an end
to your blasphemy!

This time we finish it.
There can be only one!

Dude, this is pretty
fucked up right here.

Go Santa!

Uh, go Jesus!

Chung kwang do!

Yoktuki!

Oh my god! They killed Kenny!

Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on! Come on!

Boys, help me put an end
to him once and for all.

No, boys, help me, so that
I can put an end to him.

God is watching you, boys.
You know who to help.

Stan, remember the choo-choo
when you were three?

I died for your sins, boys.
Don't forget that.

I don't know what to do,
dude. Who should we help?

I say we help Santa Claus.

Aw, you're just saying that
because he brings you candy.

Hey! I don't need to take
that kinda shit from a Jew.

You're such a fat fuck, Cartman,
that when you walk down the street

people go god DAMMIT
that kid's a BIG FAT FUCK.

Oh yeah? Well, at least I'm not a--!
Shut up!

Wait, wait, wait just a second.
Now we've got to think here.

Now let's see. What
would Brian Boitano do?

Yeah. What would
Brian Boitano do?

Did someone say my name?

Brian Boitano!
What incredible irony!

Yeah, it's Brian Boitano!

What's going on, kids?

Okay, Brian? Who would you help
in a fight, Jesus or Santa Claus?

Kids... you shouldn't
think of things like that.

This is the one time a year in
which we all try to get along,

no matter what we believe in.

This is the season just to be
good to each other.

Bye-eee!

C'mon, lumberboy!
You fuckin' pussy!

Hey, Jesus!

You have to understand that Santa is
keeping the spirit of your birthday alive

by bringing happiness and joy.
Yeah. And Santa,

you need to remember that
if it weren't for Jesus,

this day wouldn't even exist!

You're right kids. I'm sorry Jesus.

No, no. It's me who should be sorry.
I've been a right bastard.

I'm sorry Kringle.
Thank you boys.

Yeah, thank you boys.

Come on, Kringle, I'll buy
you an Orange Smoothie.

Whew. That sucked.
Yeah, but just think.

Today we actually met-- we actually
spoke-- to the Brian Boitano.

Yeah. And you know? I think
I learned something today,

It doesn't matter if you're Christian
or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.

Christmas still is about one
very important thing:

Yeah, ham.
No not ham, you fat fuck!

Fuck you!

...Christmas is about something
much more important!

What?
Presents

Don't you see
Kyle? Presents

Hey man, if you're Jewish you
get presents for eight days.

Wow, really? Count me in.
Yeah, I'll be a Jew too.

Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay

Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!
