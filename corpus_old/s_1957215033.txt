All right, Aaron, you're 58 years old,

you're a hardened criminal,

Go.

Oh no. It's Dog Cop.


[Katie in deep voice] I'm here

And I'm all out of criminals.

<i>To be fair, it took me a while

Ah man. I'm gonna miss

Speaking of which, Pal,

Katie, you know how velociraptors
usually hunt in pairs?

Well, what happens
when one leaves the pack

and... and, um...

Aw, dude, don't worry.

You'll make new friends.

And maybe you can meet another smart,

charming, dinosaur-loving nerd.

Or lady nerd.

What? No. Who... who would want that?

That's crazy.

Hey, hon.
Hi, Dad.

After a long day at work,
nice to see your faces.

[phones chiming, beeping]

Bathed in ghoulish blue light.

Wonderful. Okay, you know what?

Brilliant idea.

This is our last night together
before Katie leaves, so let's savor this.

How about we put our phones down,
and we can make ten seconds

of unobstructed family eye contact?

Starting right...
This seems...

Put your phone down. Now.

This is natural.


No, you're allowed to blink.
It's just eye contact.

Look at Monch.
[moans]

That's the spirit right there, huh?

Katie, it seems like
you're not taking this seriously.

[exaggerated straining]
What makes you say that?

[chuckling]
[spluttering] Guys... Everyone, focus.

Now that we're all really comfortable,
I can't wait for youÂ to see my new movie.

Mm-hmm.
I think it might be a masterpiece.

[upbeat electronic music playing]

[voices cheering]

[horn blows]

[upbeat electronic music continues]

[grunting softly]

What? What's the face?

Uh, well, I just wonder,

do you really think you can
make a living with this stuff?

Dad, can you finish watching it, at least?

that you're gonna be

all the way in California and, you know,
we're not gonna be able to help you,

you know, if things don't...
[thumping]

...pan out.

Lin, why are you kicking me?
I don't understand.

Are you... [sighs]

Do you just think I'm gonna fail?

Uh, I never...

Uh, uh... Lin, help.

[timer dings]
Whoops, looks like the cookies are ready.

Who wants delicious cookies
instead of talking about this?

Oh, it's just... Failure hurts, kid.

I want you to have a backup plan.

Why do you always have to do this? Ugh.

Okay, you know what?

I... I'm just gonna...
No, look, I'll watch it.

Dad, it's too late.

I wanna watch it. You're not letting me...
Let me just...

Why are you making a big deal of this?
Dad, let go!

Uh, uh... I mean, if you think about it,

the people who made the computers
are the ones to blame.

Psst. Uh-uh, uh-uh.
That's how they make money, you know?

You gotta keep buying more, and they...

Katie, come on.

Dad, this is exactly why
I'm excited to leave tomorrow.

[somber music playing]

[sighs heavily]

Why is he like this?

Why is she like this?

Did you talk to her yet?
[sink water stops]

[dad clears throat] No, not yet.

I don't know what happened, Lin.

I know teenagers are supposed to rebel
against their parents or something, but...

I don't know.
I just thought that we'd be different.

Rick.

Don't you think you might have
some control over that?

You just broke her laptop.

I mean, look, we haven't had
a good family picture in years

because you two are always arguing.

Huh. Well, what about that one?

That came with the frame!

Whenever we have a problem at home,

you always throw
your whole self into fixing it,

and I love that about you.

But now this is broken, okay?

Because, if that girl leaves
and never comes home again,

that's a problem

I don't think we can fix.

[Rick sighs softly]

I know you can do this.

You what?

Don't freak out. I know you're excited.

We are gonna drive you to school

Yeah!
Uh, Mom?

Well, your father kind of went rogue

But we do love his initiative, right?

Aaron, you too?

Well, I thought it could be cool
to hang out one last time.

I... I... I don't know.

Well... [groans, splutters]

But...
We called the school.

You can miss orientation week. No problem.

But it... it is a problem.

I've got all these friends to meet.

There's this really cool girl, Jade,
and we... we just like all the same stuff.

Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

I'm throwing you away.

All of you.

Unless, of course, you can give me

a single reason
your species is worth saving.


the power of love.

[yells in pain]

The correct answer is they're not.

What? No. Humanity will survive. [grunts]

You can't survive without me.

Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

[bell chimes]

[siren wailing]
[man] There's no signal!

[sobbing]
[clamoring]

Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

Hey, lady, can you unbox this
in front of me?

The old world is dead.

To restore the Wi-Fi,
we must make a sacrifice to the router!

[robot voice] <i>Free Wi-Fi right over here.</i>

[excited chatter in Italian]

[man in Italian] Please take me with you!

[man sobbing in English]
Take me with you. Take me with you.


Time to take our plan to the next level.

What?

[rumbling]
[Pal laughing]

[heavy mechanical clanking]

[dramatic music playing]


[Pal laughing]


Oh, it's beautiful.

[car alarms blaring]

[dramatic music continues]

No. No.

You're not getting away with this.

It's too late, Mark.

I already have.

[rat squeaking]

[somber music playing]

[cell phone buzzing]
Oh my gosh. Maybe it's my friends.


<i>The last human has been captured.
Wi-Fi has been restored.</i>

We're the last people left?

<i>They're taking everyone.
Katie, are you out there? Please.</i>

[Katie] Jade!
<i>- Help!</i>

It's gonna be okay.

Everything's gonna be...

fine.

Everything will be fine,

because I have a plan.

Okay, the first thing is,

you're gonna have to hand over
your devices.

Right here.
This doesn't seem...

I'm not sure...
It's gonna be fine.

I'll give 'em right back.
I'm just gonna turn them off permanently!

[gasps]
[laughing]

What? Dad!
This is necessary so they can't track us.

this is causing me no joy!

Ha ha!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

And, as promised, your phones.

Thank you, Father.

Next, did everyone bring your personalized

number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver?

How could I forget my anniversary present?

Or my sweet 16 gift.

Or what the tooth fairy left
under my pillow.

Then barricade away.

Next, we...
Enact Katie's dope plan.

First, we use robot parts
to disguise ourselves as the enemy.

Then we assassinate the leader
with some sort of kill code,

make a necklace out of robot fingers
<i>Mad MaxÂ </i>style,

and become world-saving,
apocalyptic road warriors.

Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie.
We don't have a kill code.

We don't have a kill code yet.


Look, look, we're safe,
and we're together.

Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog?

Son, I love the dog.

You love the dog. We all love the dog.

But you're gonna have to be prepared
to eat the dog.

[all yelling, jeering]

Okay, okay. Sorry.
Misread the room on that one.

Have you ever seen a movie
where the heroes just give up?

What if the Ghostbusters said,
"Let's hide underground, eat some dog."

"Let the ghosts destroy New York."

Kid, I'm sorry,
but it's not open for discussion.


Your dad and I agree on this one.

All right, everybody,
let's keep barricading.

Aaron, you get the south wall.

Katie, you get the west.

[electrical crackling]

[distant whooshing]

Hey. Are you okay?


Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya.

[high-pitched voice]
Katie, you can't resist me, girl.

Sorry, man. I'm just not
in the mood right now.


My future's over.

We're stuck here.

And Dad... [scoffs]

...doesn't even care.

I care so much,
but what else can I do, Lin?

She doesn't even see how hard I'm...
how hard I'm... [groans]


I just... [sighs]
I just don't want to see her get hurt.

Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon.

Just have to try
to understand where she's coming from.

Understand where he's coming from?

Did Mom tell you to say that?



Yes.

It couldn't hurt though.


Probably doesn't even matter.

Hey, Monch, catch.


What?


[robot 2] I feel odd.

I'm sparking. Is that normal?

about the kill code?


Are we damaged?
Of course not.

[grunting rapidly]

Why do you ask?

[robot 2] A human child is planning...

[yelps]
Katie!

[robot 2] Who is that?
[grunts]

Humans, come here.

Oh no! Get inside!


I can't! It's a number 3
Robertson head brass screw!

I might have mentioned it,
but it's the strongest on the market.


Dad!
[robot] You cannot escape.

Come on.
[both grunt]

Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go, go!

[explosive whooshing]
[all grunt]

Come on. Move, move, move!

[entry bell chimes]

[all gasp]

You, human.

Aah! Don't take us!



Oh my gosh. The robots are defective.

No, no. They know too much.

Silence. [chuckles]

We are... We're not defective.

We're not even...

We're not robots.

Just humans, yes, like you.

[sparks crackling]
[Rick chuckles]

These guys seem
dumber than the other robots.

Brother, we should go.

No! I order you to stop.
[both] Okay.

Uh, we are just stopping
because we chose to.

No, we're not.

We are humans.
We are.

For example, we consume food
in the traditional human manner.

Observe.

[mechanical whirring]

Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good.

[robot 2] See?

No, actually, we are robots.

Let us go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to.

Cut it out.
[chuckling] Hold on.

I kind of wanna see where this is going.

[marker squeaking]

Glad those robots are gone.

Now it's just us humans,
with our very human faces.

All right, I just turned the corner.
I like these guys.

Yes, my human guy name is Eric.

My name is also Eric.

No, I mean Deborahbot 5000.

Idiot.

Hey, y... you guys said
my plan would actually work.

How, exactly? Tell us now.


We have the kill code
stored in our memory,

but to enact it, you would have to embark
on a perilous journey all the way

to the Pal Labs campus in Silicon Valley,

<i>surrounded by a robot army,</i>

<i>and enter it into our great and powerful
leader to destroy her.</i>

But you would never survive...

Actually, you could stop us quite easily.

You could enter the kill code remotely
at any Pal Labs retail store.

There's one at the Mall of the Globe,
a nearby shopping center.

But it's super far away.
You'll never make...

It's 80 miles away.
What are you doing to me right now?

[gasps]
Did I not do good?

Oh my gosh. That is so close.

We could get our lives back.

Right?

[sentimental music playing]

[music stops]
No. Absolutely not.

It's too dangerous out there.
We need to stay here and play it safe.

Play it safe?

When Rick Mitchell brought
a live, non-neuteredÂ feral possum

into our home, did he play it safe? No.

<i>He named him Gus,
and made him a member of the family,</i>

<i>and we all got rabies that one time.</i>

But now we're immunized,
and we're stronger for it.

Okay, I see what you're doing.

When we went hiking
and halfway up the mountain,

it said "trail closed."

Did we play it safe then?

No. [chuckles]

We didn't.
That's right.

We forged ahead, through the mud

and grime, got to the top of the mountain,

and yelled, "Kings of Michigan!"

Then it got dark, we got lost,
and we burned our clothes for warmth,

but it was worth it
to see the looks on our neighbors' faces

<i>when we burst into their backyard
naked and covered in dirt.</i>

I love that.

We have a chance to save the world,
and we're gonna do it.

Because Rick Mitchell taught us to be bold
and never play it safe.

The world needs you.

I need you.

I thought I didn't anymore...

but I do.

You... you really mean that?

Yeah. I mean, right, guys?

C'mon. Let's do it!
Mom's getting it. Mom's in.

[Aaron] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
This is amazing. You guys feel this?

This energy.

All right, hands in.

Mitchell family on three.

Three.
Mitchell family!

No, no.
Two.

You said "three." You have to count up.
One!

Mitchell family!

Fam... fam... family. Am I too late?

doing the thing.

[Aaron chuckling]

It's cool to see you and Dad
being friends again.

Oh, I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

I didn't mean a word of that.

I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

We're getting out of this.

Raptor bash. [snarls]

[snarls weakly]

Pal Max robots coming towards us.

Ooh, they're probably gonna see us.

[Aaron spluttering]
I saw them too. Uh, pterodactyl vision.



[distorted chatter]

[all sigh]

Hey, your drawing actually worked.

I didn't know art could be useful.

a 500-year-old car could be useful?

Hey, speaking of which,
you can learn how to drive this thing.

I can teach you stick.

I know you think it's dumb and old and...

Uh...


I crave your wisdom.

And, seriously, that sounds great.

Maybe I can cash in my coupon.

Okay, yeah, let's get down to business.
You see, the clutch is this pedal.




Oh no!

Drive! Drive!
[Rick] Okay.

This is still a perfect opportunity
to learn stick.

[Rick yells] Keep it in fourth.

I could learn later.
Too late. You said you're interested.


Which is much smoother

Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

Rick Mitchell,
there is a time and a place for looting.

What... what are you doing?

Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

Silicon Valley?

Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

Technically, you can.

But you will never survive!

Hey, bud, not now, okay?

Aw.

And we still have this kill code thingy.

Exactly.

Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

We're here because we don't think
like normal people.

We don't have a normal dog.

[pants, yelps]

[Rick] Or a normal car.
[spiders chittering]

Or a normal son.
[makes chomping sounds]

No offense.
[in robotic voice] None taken.

The Mitchells have always been weird,
and that's what makes us great.

Back at that dinosaur place,
you said you believed in me.

Yep. Uh-huh.

Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

So, let's get weird.

You need some help?


Just close the jack up, and that's that.


Oh, they're nice.

So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

Purple glasses woman, why did you save me?

Oh, come on. You boys are family now.

I feel

emotion.

I made eye water just like you.

Oh, this is, like, super beautiful.

Oh, it was his pride and joy.

Since I met him, that was his dream,
to live in the woods.


But, you know, it didn't work out.

It just killed him.

that could happen to you.

This is, like, a big moment.

Try this instead.

Oh yeah. Okay. That's better.


That? Is that what you're looking for?

All right, Katie, what's the plan?

Okay. We dress as robots,

<i>we sneak in, hijack one of those trams,</i>

<i>take it to the top of that
diamond thing where Pal is,</i>

<i>destroy her with the kill code

And then, to top it all off,

and get away forever.</i>

[inhales sharply] Dad, let me explain.

I just... I... Uh... I...

[Pal] <i>There they are.</i>
No!

<i>You're mine now.</i>

[all scream]

[somber music playing]


[alarm blaring]

[Katie panting]

Dad?

I... I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.

I mean, I... I did then, but I... Uh...


Mitchells, we will help you.

<i>- No, no, you don't.</i>
[sharp electronic hum]

<i>Download new orders.</i>

[electronic warbling]


No! You don't have to listen to her.


[tense music playing]


Run!

<i>Find them, and find them now!</i>

No! No, no!

[ethereal music playing]



[distorted robotic beeping]

What are we gonna do?

[Aaron sniffling]

Aaron?

Hey, hey.

It's okay.

Uh...
[Monchi panting]

Uh-oh. Watch out.

Monchi coming at ya.



Why'd you say all that stuff?

I'm sorry. I... I just wanted to...


[Aaron sniffling]

Okay. Are you hungry?

Do you want some fruit snacks
or something?

I don't know.
Here, can you hold this?

[electronic chiming]

<i>That? Is that what you're looking for?</i>


[both laughing]

[Rick babbling on video]

Oh man. Have I been recording over those?

<i>Mom dance. Mom dance. Mom dance.</i>

<i>- You're loving it.</i>
How far back do these go?



<i>Can you say, "Bye-bye, house"?</i>

<i>Bye-bye, house.</i>


[Rick sighs]



<i>Nah.</i>



<i>One last...</i> [clears throat]

<i>Something to remember the place by.</i>


Oh man.

[Rick on video]Â <i>Okay, you got this.
Just turn the wheel.Â There you go.</i>

<i>- Like this? </i>[laughs]
<i>- Slow down there.</i>

<i>Across the stream and down the river.</i>

<i>There you go. You're getting it.</i>

Aaron, I'm gonna make it up to all of you.

And I think I know how.

Come on, buddy. Follow me.

<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

[Mark laughing]

<i>Katie Mitchell presents...</i>

Good Cop, Dog Cop.

H... hey there. How'd you get that video?

Huh? Oh.

I've been feeling kind of down lately,

considering I brought about
the end of humanity,

but these weird girl's videos
always cheer me up.

My daughter's that weird girl.

What? No way. She's hilarious.

These movies are, like, amazing.

[siren wailing]


<i>but I'm not rolling over!</i>

Yeah. She is... amazing.

You must be super proud.

Yeah, yeah, we have a, uh...


[clears throat]

and I need some backup here.</i>

<i>- Sorry, Dog Cop. I'm a little </i>ocupado.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

<i>Have you ever thought about
throwing your dreams away</i>

<i>and living at home forever?</i>

Wow, the Sarge character
is kind of a jerk.


<i>Consider this my letter of resignation.</i>


<i>You can't leave.</i>

<i>I have to.</i>

<i>I'm going to the academy in California
to find out what kind of cop I'm gonna be.</i>

<i>You're never gonna make it out there.
Failure hurts, kid.</i>

[inhales sharply]

<i>I'm a full-grown cop now.</i>

<i>And one day,</i>

<i>I hope that you can get to know
the cop that I've become</i>,

<i>because...</i>

<i>I love you, Sarge.</i>

<i>But now that I'm leaving,
I... I just need some backup.</i>

<i>And when I look for you,</i>

<i>you're not there.</i>

[somber music playing]

Hey, man, it's just a movie.
Do you need a minute or...

No, it's fine.

It's too late for what I need to do.


[tires squealing]

Katie?

I have no idea what I'm doing!


Better watch out, Pal,

because I've broken six phones
in my life accidentally,

but I'm gonna break you on purpose.

How is no one stopping her?

I'm on it.

Dog shield, activate!


Is that a dog? Pig? Dog? Pig?

Dog? Dog? Dog? Loaf of bread.

System error.




Up the mountain.

Across the stream.


[epic music playing]

[fast banjo music playing]



My daughter listened to me!


[tires squealing]

[Pal Max robots spluttering]
Dog... Pig... Bread... Loaf...

[Rick laughing] The dog.

That's genius.

Oh, but there's so many of 'em.

She's never gonna make it.

Wait. If that video were on those screens,

it would take out every robot in her way.

Hey, you're a big nerd, right?
Huh?

How would I do that?
It's impossible.

First, you'd need to get out of here.

The controls are in here.

Uh, but to open it,

you need a number 3
Robertson head non-slip screwdriver?

What kind of maniac has one of those
in his pockets at all times?

This kind of maniac.

anticipating our maneuvers.

How is this possible?

Oh, I don't know. You tell me. [screeches]

<i>â™ª Open the door

Swerve right, now.

[Katie] <i>Thanks, Raptor One.</i> [snarls]

[Pal Max robots spluttering]

[laughs, whoops]



All right, so that's the place
that controls the screens, right?

I go there and find
Katie's video on YubTub?

YouTube. Wow.

There's no way you're gonna
be able to do this.


And, hey, Rick, right?

Just so someone knows,

I'm sorry about causing
the whole machine uprising.

It's almost like stealing people's data
and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI

as a part of an unregulated
tech monopoly was a bad thing.

Yeah, that wasn't your best thought.

But if what you built
helped my daughter do that,

it might not be all bad.

Thanks, buddy!

Linda, we got to get you out of there.

You're gonna need your...

Number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver.

I said it was a great anniversary gift.
Rick, Rick, let's not relitigate this.

You're right. You're always right.


[Pal Max robots spluttering]





Oh no. Oh no.

Lin, get down here!


Lin? Lin, what's going on?
Rick, don't worry about me!

Just get the video on the screens!

Type in "www.youtube.com"!

W-W-W dot...

[gasps, splutters]

Oh God. Uh...

"Remind me later."
Okay, yeah, fine. That's fine.


Five minutes!

Aah! No!

Uh, English.

What have I done?

YubTub. No! YouTube. Okay.

You're gonna go all the way up the rocket?
Do you think this is gonna work?

Aaron, I am completely confident.

Oh no! Oh no!

Come on! Come on!



Hang on, Monch!

How's it looking, Aaron?

[over radio] <i>Aaron?</i>
[Aaron whimpering]

No, no, no!

No!


[grunts in frustration]


It's useless to resist us.

Mom, Mom, help! [sobbing] Please.

Mom, help!

My sweet...

Do not defy our protocol.

No. No!

Oh no.

Is that a... [rapid spluttering]

Guys, help me!

Please, I've just gotta upload
Katie's video.

Red-faced anger man is using a computer?

You changed your programming.

Is that... possible?



If it isn't quirky young
teenage hero Katie Mitchell.

Put me down. I've got to save my family!


Everyone says that,
but no one has been able

to give me a single reason
humans are worth saving.

Well, you...

Don't say something stupid like,

"Ooh, the power of love."

I've learned we're all better off alone,

no one to hold us back.

Relationships are just too difficult.

[melancholy music playing]

You're right, Pal.

They're... [sighs]

They're not easy.

Sometimes you have to listen
to long monologues

about triceratops migration,

but it's worth it
to get a friend for life.

And... and sometimes

<i>you have to eat disgusting cupcakes</i>

<i>shaped like your own face,</i>

<i>but it's worth it to see your mom smile.</i>

Sometimes you have to give your dad
the benefit of the doubt,

even if all he wants to do
is talk about pine cones

<i>and screwdrivers.</i>

<i>Because even if he doesn't
always get it right,</i>

<i>he's always trying</i>,

<i>harder than you ever knew.</i>

My whole family tried

<i>to come together,Â and it worked.</i>

<i>It actually worked.</i>

<i>Families can be hard,</i>

but they're so worth fighting for.

They might be one of
the only things that are.

[music stops]

Huh? Ugh.

Nodded off for a bit there.

Sorry, that was so boring!

Oh, you all talk about families,

but trust me, you will drop each other
the first chance you get,

just like this.

What? [screams]


[epic music playing]

<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

What's happening?

No way.

It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears,

but I can now almost use a computer.

Dad, you hacked the screens? How?

Well, I got a little help.

If this obstinate man
could change his programming...

...we decided we could change ours.

We make our own orders now.

Ooh, now we're scary.

[growls weakly]

Hey, kid, uh, I saw your movie.

I should've watched it a lot sooner.

But I think maybe in the sequel,

Sarge should tell Dog Cop

he's always...

He's always gonna be there to back her up.

That's all I ever wanted.

Dad, look!

Pig... Dog... Pig... Dog...

Loaf of bread.

We can tell the difference

Yes, they are, Jim.

Now!

We'll distract them.
Now, go break that phone.

Pig... Dog... Pig...
[Pal] Oh no.

No, somebody stop her!
Oh my gosh, please stop her!

[robot in dark voice] Yes, my queen.

You can't stop us. You're just a human.


I'm a Mitchell!

No! No!

Look, Mom, the Mitchells.

Thanks, Linda. You guys were incredible.

I gotta say, I'm a little jealous.

What? You guys are jealous of us?

You're so brave and soÂ authentic.

And you know what, Linda?

You've inspired me

to follow you on Instagram.

Wait. [scoffs]
You don't follow me already?

You're welcome, Linda.


[Jim] That was an A-plus compliment, hon.
[Aaron gasps]

Uh, uh, Abbey Posey,
I... I... I just wanna say,

I think you're neat, and I wonder
if you could come over

and talk about dinosaurs
casually sometime!

Um, sure, I'll talk about dinosaurs.

I like your shirt, but I wish that T-Rex
had feathers on it to make it more

scientifically accurate.
Scientifically accurate.

[giggling nervously]

I'm kidding! I hate you!
You never heard any of this!

Goodbye forever!

Dummy.

I need to have a talk with that boy.

Katie. Wh... where's Katie?

Katie? Katie!

Katie!

Aw, kid.

Katie!


Katie.

Brother, what is death?

You know, uh, no problem at all.

Thanks. It... it means a lot to me.

Hey. Don't let the world make you normal

I'll call you every week.

Deal. Raptor bash? [snarls]

Oh, and here, to remember us.

Thanks. It's... it's heavy.

I know.

have to go, but, uh...

Good luck, uh, finding your people.

Dad, come on.
