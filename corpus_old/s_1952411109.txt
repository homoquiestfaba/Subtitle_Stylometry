[male voice sings]

â™« Last Sunday morning â™«

â™« The sunshine
Felt like rain â™«

â™« The week before,
They all seemed the same â™«

â™« With the help of God
And true friends â™«

â™« I come to realize â™«

â™« I still had
Two strong legs â™«

â™« And even wings to fly â™«

â™« Oh, I ain't wasting
Time no more â™«

â™« 'Cause time goes by like â™«

â™« Like hurricanes
And faster things â™«

We heard it on the radio.
ln the songs, you could tell

that there was a movement--

(woman 2)
Because we were hearing
what was going on

all over
the country.

Yes, yes.

And it seemed like
it was real everywhere

but here.
What happened?

How did we get
left behind?

I lived in this part of
North Carolina all my life.

Back in 1 970, these fields
were flat-covered in tobacco.

Far as you could see.

lf tobacco was the blood
of eastern North Carolina,

then Oxford was its heart.

For 300 years, tobacco flowed
through those old warehouses.

And like blood,
it kept people alive--

black and white.

After having served
in Vietnam,

and having many
black soldiers
around me,

where it was
pretty much the norm,

I come back home
and only find a
few blacks

on the Highway Patrol
at the time,

it seemed
a little
strange to me.

But being
an old North Carolina boy

and raised down in New Bern,

um, I was surprised,
but at the same time,

my background told me
that I wasn't too surprised.

Martin Luther King
was never my favorite,

but I admired him.

I liked what he stood for.

But after Dickie Marrow
was killed,

nobody was having
that shit anymore.

We was about ready
to kick some ass
our own selves.

(little boy)
What is it?

(older boy)
Shh.

See? I told you
Grandma Jessie's rich.

Wow.

There's gotta be close to
$10 worth of Cokes
right here.

I'm gonna take one.

She won't miss it.

Vern, Tim,
come on outside

and say goodbye
to your grandmother.

Vernon.

Saying our goodbyes,
Mother Jessie.

Vernon, before you go,

there's something serious
l've got to talk
to you about.

lf my boys
broke something, you
know I'm good for it.

Bye, Grandma.

So long, Grandma!

I n the car!
Okay, last one.

Well, I think
we're ready.

Martha, I asked Vidalia
to pack a basket of food
for the trip.

Would you go see
if it's ready?

Of course.

[door closes]

Anyway, Vernon,

I know you believe
you can talk your way
out of every predicament,

but Oxford
is not like Biscoe.

They're more
set in their ways.

Don't you worry,
Mother Jessie.

The Lord hasn't
let us down yet.

It's not the Lord
I'm worried about, Vernon.

Let's get this show
on the road, Tysons.

Load 'em up.

Oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

You be sure
and write me, you hear?

I will. I'm gonna
miss it here, too.

All right, sweetie. Bye.

Bye, Mother Jessie.

(both boys)
Bye, Grandma.

Vernon, you take
care now.

I don't want to leave.

Me, neither.

Come on, everyone.
We're on an adventure.

[bell rings]

Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

I said good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

Good morning.

Welcome to
third period English.

My name is Mr. Chavis.

And I'm your teacher.

lf you could, turn
with me to page 1 5
in your textbooks.

We'll be covering
Ralph Ellison.

Mr. Chavis.

Yes.

you really know
Stokely Carmichael
the Black Panther?

Yes. I know him.

When I was at U NCC, I had him
speak to a student assembly.

And they let
you do that?

Sure. I was head
of the Student Union.

And I thought it would be
a good idea if people heard
what he had to say.

What's a
Student Union?

What's a Student Union?

A Student Union is basically
an organization of students,

a place to meet,
discuss ideas,
affect change.

Any other questions
before we start?

Yeah. Why'd you ever want
to come back to Oxford?

Are you sure you priced
this flour right?

I can get it over at the A&P
for almost 50 cents less.

Then you just walk
another mile and a half
over there and buy it.

May I have a bag, please?

Why do we have a house
with furniture already in it?

Because the church
owns it, honey.

It's not ours.

Remember the one
where all the furniture
was covered in plastic?

Hah. That was a long
time ago, little buck.

Oh, Vernon,
it's beautiful.

I just hope they haven't
completely redecorated
the place.

Just once, l'd like
to paint our home myself.

Okay, everyone,
best behavior.

Let's go, Tysons.

Reverend Tyson ! Hi.

You must be Martha.

Yes, hi.

I'm lsabel Taylor,
and on behalf

of the ladies
of First Methodist,

welcome to Oxford
and your new home.

We knew y'all would
be getting in late,

so we just
dropped off
a few things

so you'd have
something for supper.

Well, thank you.
Everything looks
so nice.

We painted
the whole house
and redid the drapes.

You shouldn't have.

Well, I don't
mean to be rude,

but I need to
excuse myself.

But you ladies,
you feel free to
stay and just visit

for as long
as you like.

See you Sunday.

Sure you don't need
any help unpacking?

No, thanks,
I'm fine. Bye.

Oh, Lord, not again.



Come in.

Mrs. Tyson?

Yes?

Hi. My name is
Roseanna Allen.

I'm a friend of Vidalia,
who works for your mother.

She said you might be
needing some help.

Roseanna, you
are a godsend.

Ben, is that you?

Yeah, it's me, Mom.

Oh, good.
Dinner's ready.

And all you could see
were these little feet

running down the hall,
just bare bottomed,

and him chasing him.
It was so--

You were
chasing my baby?

I was trying
to catch him.

I was trying to--
And you know, you would be
surprised how quick he is.

He was just
mad because they
broke the vase.

Do you know how long
we've had that, though?

I gave you
the money for--

Oh, come
on, that--

Quit crying
about the vase.

So did you see Mary
Catherine Chavis
at school?

Mm-hmm.

She still there?
She was tough.

I still don't understand
why you didn't take
that offer

to start on
your doctorate
right away.

You know, you
are always
better off

just getting into it
and getting it
over with.

I don't know. Those kids
at Mary Potter, they'll

drive Ben to graduate school
faster than a scholarship.

Well, actually,
I was thinking

about doing something
else with my time.

Really? What's that?

Reopening the
Ridley Drive-l n.

Opening up Granddaddy's
old place?

Why?

Well, I think
there's a need.

A need for whom?

I guess we'll
find out.

[male voice

[music fading]

(man 1)
How's it look?

(man 2)
That's good.

What do you think?

Yeah, man, good job.

My father loved
this place.

[chuckles gently]

This may be your Ph D.

[chuckles softly

Good morning.

Morning.

For those of you just returned
from behind the I ron Curtain

or perhaps trekking
somewhere high in
the Himalayas

where phone
service, I'm told,
is not all that good--

my name is
Vernon Tyson,

your new pastor
here at Oxford
Methodist Church.

I want to
thank all of you

who welcomed
my wife Martha

and our four children,

Vern, Tim,

Boo, and Julie,
with such open arms

and made us feel
so welcome this week.

Now, let us pray.

Father,

we live in difficult times
that challenge our faith

in new and often
difficult circumstance.

Grant us the power
to choose right
from wrong,

and the strength
to love all people

of all races,
because in the
eyes of God,

we are all equal.

ln Your holy name
we pray. Amen.

Amen.

[knock on door]

Mrs. Alwin,
I'm Reverend Tyson.

I heard you
on the radio.

You have a
beautiful voice.

Well, thank you, ma'am.

'Course, I don't usually
trust preachers with
beautiful voices.

They tend to
think too highly
of themselves.

But then I
heard your sermon
about the Negroes,

and I changed my mind.

I thought this
is either a man

with a
total disregard
for his career,

or else he's one of the
bravest preachers
I ever heard.

Either way, he wasn't
all full of himself.

Well, I'm not sure

my wife would completely
agree with you on that.

She must be
a good woman.

She is.

Children?

Two boys,
two girls.

Good.

You know, Reverend,
l've been a member
of that church

for 87 years,
and l've seen

20, 22 pastors
stand in that pulpit,

some good, some
not so good.

But they all fell
into two groups.

They were either priests,
or they were prophets.

The priests told us
the comforting things
we wanted to hear.

The prophets
challenged us

with the
difficult things
we needed to hear.

Which one
are you?

I try to be
a little bit
of both.

Oh, Reverend,

in these times,
I think you're going
to find it very hard

to be both.

[cheerful indistinct chatter]

[soul music]

â™« [male voice
sings indistinct] â™«

Man, we need to put
up a basketball hoop
out back.

What for? Why don't
you just go to the
park and play?

[men laugh]

What's so funny?

They took down
all the rims.

What you mean, took down
the rims? What are you
talking about?

Rims, man. The town
took down the rims

to keep us out of
their neighborhood.

Oh, man, don't
look like that.

You know how stuff
changes here.

One step forward,
two steps back.

Name one black person
working a shop downtown.

Unless they
got a broom
in their hands.

They got one brother
on the police force.

He been
there four years

and still ain't allowed
to arrest any
white folks.

So what y'all gonna
do about that?

Shit. People been
pushing change
downtown for years.

Ain't nothing
gonna happen.

Yeah. I agree
with you, Eddie.

Ain't nothing
gonna happen--

unless you make
it happen.

(male voice)
No one's saying you
don't work hard, Robert.

Jesus. You work
like a slave.

It's just that some folks
downtown want to make sure

you got things under
control out here,
that's all.

Now you tell those folks
not to worry about
their investment.

Ain't nobody
gonna mess with
me out here.

I got friends who'll
guarantee me of that.

The change
machine's empty
in the laundromat.

Hello, Mr. Watkins.

Larry, how you
doing, son?

Fine, sir!

[cash register
bell rings]

Now you have
a good day.

Howdy.

What you need?

Driving by,
see the shop,

realize I'm due
for a haircut.

No.

No?

No what?

I need to make
an appointment?

No.

I don't cut
y'all's hair here.

All right, all right.

No problem.

I'll go to a fellow
in town I know.

Y'all have a good day.

You know what, Robert?

You've got
a good thing
going on out here.

lf you don't die
of a heart attack
trying to keep it up

and if you
keep that temper of
yours under control,

you might
just end up
a rich man.

Don't you worry
about me, Billy.

I'm gonna be fine.

(male voice)
Next order of business,
a request by Mike Taylor

for a new stop sign
down his way.

Neil, is
the application
in order?

Yes. We've
been out there
and checked it out.

Then I'm looking
for a motion to
move this thing along.

Motion.
Second.

All in favor?

Aye.

Opposed? Motion carried.

Next item.

Restoration of
the basketball
rims in city park.

Mr. Chavis, this
is your request?

It is, Your Honor.

Looks pretty
straightforward to me.

Um...

unfortunately, Mr. Chavis,
we are not

the jurisdictional body
you need to be addressing.

That would be the town
Recreational Committee,

which meets the first
Tuesday of every month.

I have, Your Honor.

I beg your pardon?

I have
submitted that request
to the Rec Committee,

but since it never holds
a quorum in its meetings,

it can't vote
on that request.

Well, better
luck next month.

Mr. Mayor,

the Rec Committee has
not held a quorum
since 1964,

which, not coincidentally,

was the year
of the Federal
Civil Rights Act.

But, that may be,

but there's nothing
that we can do
about that.

Actually, there is,
Your Honor.

Based on the town charter,

if a standing committee
is without a quorum

for a period of longer
than six months,

then it's possible
for this council--
to call for a vote.

Neil?

He is correct,
Your Honor.

But only if there is
a quorum present

at the time
the vote is called.

[clears throat]

Your Honor
and everybody,

I'm sorry, but I forgot
I need to leave
early tonight.

I'm afraid I have
to leave early as
well, Your Honor.

Well, that leaves us
without a quorum.

Adjourned.

How'd it go?

What was that
Frederick Douglass quote

your father was always
so fond of reciting?

Power concedes nothing...

Without a demand.

Yeah, well,
I demanded.

The power
just rolled
right over me.

Well, I don't think
Frederick Douglass

expected the
power to yield
on his first attempt.


I guess he didn't.

Get some rest, son.

Night, Momma.

Pack of menthol
Rx, please.

What you trying
to pull, boy?

They're--for
my momma, sir.

Yeah?

Then she ought to know
that they're 35 cents.

Why'd you tell him
these were for
your momma?

For 35 cents, he'd
sell the baby Jesus
a pack of smokes.

He's got, like,
500 other--

That was awesome.

Sweet, man.

What the heck?

Hey, what're you
niggers doing in
our neighborhood?

What're you doing?

Y'all better get
your black asses
out of here

before we
come over there
and kick them out!

Run!

Hey!

You get home. Now.


Thank you, Roseanna.

He was gonna
kill me!

And why
would that be?

Well, because Jebbie
threw a rock at him.

I didn't throw it!

Well, it didn't look like
you did much to stop him.

You go clean up.

And get
them cigarettes
out your back pocket

before your momma
gets home.

Thanks, Roseanna.

Good night.

See you tomorrow.

What're you
gonna do?

I'm taking you on
a trip, little buck.

Whoo!

Come on! Let's go!

Come on, Daddy!

Are you
speaking to me?

Yeah!

Woo-hoo!

Daddy?

When are you
gonna talk to me?

I'm not, little buck.

I'm gonna
show you something.

What is it, Daddy?

It's a revival!

Tim.

Tim. It's
not a revival.

(man's voice)
The light of Jesus.

For our God.

The light of Jesus.

The light of Christ.

The light of Jesus.

Deliverance.

We are the chosen ones.

By the fire of
Calvary's cross

and the sentinel
and the bearer of
the light,

jointly give birth
to the star.

For our God.
For our God.

Let the
circles of light
become alive.

The light of Christ.

We mean to cleanse
and purify
our virtues

by burning out our
vices from the fire
of His word.

The light of Christ.

Honor,

truth, loyalty, purity.

For our God.
For our God.


I want to go, Daddy.

Shh.

Please, Daddy.
I want to go home now.

Let the circle
truly become

a living representation
of our order

in the darkness
of the world.

When I saw the cross,
I thought everything
was good.

Evil can sometimes be
hard to recognize.

It hides in
normal things.

People you
think you know.

But recognizing evil
isn't the hardest part.

It's standing
up to it,

even when nobody
else will.

(Dr. Proctor)
So essentially, the
quality of our choices

determine the quality
of our lives.

Which, translated, means
you probably need to work
a little harder.

Thank you.

Dr. Proctor, my name is
Reverend Vernon Tyson.

Reverend Tyson.

Please.

I'm the pastor
at the Oxford
Methodist Church.

I heard you
preach last year

at the North Carolina
Council of Churches.

You gave a
magnificent speech.

Well, thank you,
Reverend Tyson.

But I'm assuming that
wasn't the only reason
you came to see me.

So he said yes.

And we'll get run out
of town together.

You might be
right about that.

Well, I think
you're overreacting.

I'm just
saying there are
people in this town

who think that things
have moved awfully fast
in a very short time

and maybe
they should just--
slow down a bit.

Well, if anybody
bothered to ask the
blacks in this town,

they'd tell you if things
went any slower they'd
be going backward.

At the very least
don't you think you
should've consulted

with the Executive Committee
before inviting him to speak?

Dr. Samuel Proctor
is one of the leading
educators in America.

All the
more embarrassing
if you have to go back

and tell
him they won't
let him preach.

They? Who is they?

You know
full well
who's they.

They, who
put bread
on our table.


I know what I'm
doing, Martha.

Trust me.

Just promise you'll give
me 24 hours notice to
start packing.

Bless this food
to the nourishment
of our bodies.

[phone ringing]

May Your goodness
and mercy be upon us

and with those
less fortunate.

I n Your
holy name. Amen.

Amen.

No. I got it.

Reverend Tyson.

Oh, hello, John.

Yes, as a matter of fact,
we just sat down--

Yeah, sure, l'd
be happy to listen.

I see.

Un-huh.

Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

but I'm afraid
I can't do that.

No.

[phone ringing]

Reverend Tyson.

(male voice)
Is it true you invited

a nigger to preach
at our church?

Who is this?

'Cause if it's true,
you're gonna regret it.

Who is this?

[dial tone]


(kids, shouting)
Fight! Fight!

Stop it! Stop it!

Tim Tyson!

What are you doing?

He called Daddy
a nigger-lover.

Your daddy
doesn't need
you to defend him.

I wasn't defending
him, Momma.

I was trying
not to be wicked.

Wicked?

Daddy says
the wickedest
thing we can do

is to do nothing.

Oh, honey.


Dorothy.

I came as soon
as I heard.

How's Joe?

He's gonna be okay.

Thank God.

Vernon...

he isn't
gonna want to see
you when he comes out.

Vernon? ls that you?

Vernon?

Dick called.

They scheduled
an executive committee
meeting tonight at 7:00.

What was I
thinking, Martha?

Did I really
believe I could change
everything by myself?

You're not changing
anything--by yourself.

I'm here.

Stand your ground.

Good evening, everyone.

Reverend Tyson.

Jack, Mr. Pink.

Vernon.

Dick.

I'm assuming we're
all here tonight

because of my invitation
to Dr. Samuel Proctor
to speak this Sunday.

Why would you
do this, Vernon?

I got people coming
into my store asking me

what kind of ship
we're running here.

Wanting to know did
we really invite

a Negro preacher
to stand in
our pulpit?

And what did you
tell them, Jack?

I told them
they heard wrong.

Ain't no Negro professor
speaking in our church
on Sunday.

Oh, Jack, why in the hell
would you say something
like that?

'Cause it's the
truth, Thad!

Vernon, nobody's saying
that it's perfect here,

but we've got good relations
with the Negro community.

This might not be time
to--to stir things up.

What time is
a good time, Dick?

A year from now?

What, five years
from now, Doug?

Does that sound about right?
Once your boys graduate
high school?

Ten years from now? Heck,
this is starting to sound
like work.

Why don't we just
leave it for the next
generation to fix?

lf this man
speaks on Sunday,

there will
be a breach

that will split
this congregation.

Is he worth tearing
this church apart over?

You, um, you can end
this with one
call, Vernon.

Just call him
and tell him
don't come.

We're living beneath
a dam, gentlemen,

a dam that's holding back
300 years of wrong.

Now, you can say that dam
ain't going to break

all you want,
but when the rains come

and that dam bursts open

and all that's bad
comes flooding out,

you won't have time
to run for high ground.

Now is the time.

That's why
I invited him.

And that's why I'm not
making that phone call.

Well, that's all
well and good, Vernon,

but this is
our church,

and you don't have
a right to do this.

Well, actually,
Jack, I do. And
you gave it to me.

This is the Methodist
Book of Discipline.

It defines the
rules that govern
our denomination.

And it says--

"the pastor
of this church
can determine the number

and the nature of services
held in the sanctuary."

And for the moment,
I am still the pastor
of this church.

Now, if you see
things differently,

you give Bishop
Grayson Tullis
a phone call

and you let him know.

Otherwise, I have a job
to do tomorrow, gentlemen.

And I hope to see
you all there.

[organ playing]

Reverend Tyson?

You never asked me what I
was going to speak about.

No, sir.

I didn't think
that was my place.

Thank you.

Shall we face
the lions?


I come to you today

to talk about a problem
of enormous magnitude.

Something some of you would
probably rather not hear about.

But it is a subject
that affects us.

I am the president
of North Carolina A&T,

a black university
of approximately 4,000--

I'll be right back.

outstanding young men
and women.

Among our many fine
accomplishments

is our football program.

The other day,
my coach came in
to see me.

He told me
that the finest
running back

he had ever seen
is down at New Bern.

Now, this prospect's daddy
and his brother both went
to A&T.

But when my coach went
down to recruit him,

he say he ain't
coming to A&T.

Said he's going to school
over at Chapel Hill,

says he's going to play
for the Tarheels.

They got the big school
over there, big money,

the big stadium, and he's
going to play for them.

Then my poor coach
drove over to Kinston

to see about this 300-pound
offensive tackle they got

at the Negro
high school there.

A fine young man,
good grades,

but he say he ain't
coming to A&T, either.

That his mama wants him
to play for N .C. State

and wear the red and white
of the Wolfpack.

Well, when Coach finished,
he looked at me defeated,

and said, "I'm sorry,
but we're going to struggle

"next year
on the football field

and probably
for years to come."

l've never seen
a sadder man.

I walked over
and put an arm
around him and said,

"See, that's the problem
with all this integration,

Coach, that's just the price
we're going to have to pay."


Our lesson today comes
from the Book of John.

Willie Mae? You
listening to
the radio?

Willie Mae?

(little girl, happily)
Daddy!

[happy sob]

[loud music,
cheerful whooping]


[indistinct chatter]

What'd they feed you
over there, boy?
You're getting big.

Ah ! Cockroaches.

Take this off, handsome.

How are y'all all doing?

You're looking great,
looking great.

That Miss Mary Catherine?

How you doing, son?

Hey, Mr. Yancey.

Thank you
for coming tonight.
I really appreciate it.

You look great.
You look great.

Thank you, sir.

Still growing up like a weed,
but you look great.

Thank you.
See you guys
in a little bit.

See you.

How you doing, man?

Fanny. Hey, baby,
how you doing?

It's good to see you.

Good to see you.
I'll see you
in a little bit.

Hey, Roseanna.

Hey.

You look wonderful.

Auntie Roberta.

Wonderful.

Give me some
of that sugar.

Yes. Yes.

Dickie, we took care
of Willie Mae and the
girls for you.

Just like you
took care of me.

Yes.

Now it's your turn
to take care of them.

I will.
I promise.

Hey, darling.

Betsy, you didn't let him
touch none of this food,
did you?

Well, well, well.
What the cat
dragged in.

How's life at
the rubber plant?

It's good. They're starting
up a late shift next week,

but I ain't
too interested in that.

Well, good. You can
help me down at
the store

in all your
spare time.


Did you put that chain
on that boat trailer
like I told you?

Yeah.

Well, you better have.

You let something
like that slip

and you go back
and that boat
won't be there.

The chain's there. Boat'll
be there when we get back.

Like that time
you left the
bolt undone

on the back door and
they stole us blind
down at the shop.

That was
an accident.

Took care of that.

Yeah, when it
was too late.

You need to use
your head, son.

Yes, sir.

Betsy went to
the doctor today.

The baby's doing fine.
Everything looks okay.

Maybe once that baby
comes, y'all'll come
by more often.

You ready to
be a granddaddy?

Hmpf.

You ready to be
an uncle, boy?

I don't even like
being a brother.


Go on back upstairs
and start packing
your bags, then.

All right, you
see Mr. Fox here?

Mr. Fox needs some sleep, too,
just like you need some sleep.

All right? All right.
So get to bed.

I'll see you
in the morning.
All right?

[tired sigh]

Why don't you
go find Boo

and play
a couple hands
of bid whist.

I know you've been
wanting to catch up.

I'll be okay.

I'll be back
in a bit.

I'll be waiting.

Go on.

Who's there?

It's Dickie, Fanny.
How you feeling?

Oh, I'm hanging
in there.

lf you're
looking for Boo,
he ain't here.

Think he's
at Four Corners.

lf you're
going over there,

will you get me
a ice-cold soda?

I sure am thirsty.

You got it.

And don't
go getting
in no trouble.

Bring my soda
right back here
to me.

Yes, ma'am.

Okay. I took out
the trash and broke
down those boxes.

Anything else?

Yeah. Go lock up
the barber shop.

How much longer
we gonna be here?

Well, till the old man
turns the lights out.

He closing up?

I'll bet you that's
the last time Roger
comes over for dinner.

Hey, Dickie.
Is that you?

Yes, ma'am,
Mrs. Downing.

Seen Boo?

No, man.

Nowhere.

All right.

Hey, girls.

Y'all looking
good tonight.

Is this where all
the action is?

I can't believe y'all
out here all by
y'allselves.

Hey, nigger!
Hey, you!

That's my wife
you're talking to.

Hey, man, listen, I
was just talking to
the sisters here.

Right.

Hey, man, it's cool.
Listen, listen.

I was just talking
to the sisters over here.

The hell you were.

Man, what're
you doing?

I'll show you
what I'm doing.


Larry, no!

Hey!

Larry, no!


Stop it!
Larry, stop!

Stop!

Damn!

You're crazy, man!

He's got
a knife!

Hey, Dickie!
Dickie, run!

Hey, where's the fire?

[shotgun blasts echo]

[Boo shouts, moaning]


I didn't do nothing!

Okay, okay, man.

You got me.

Let's just
forget about it.
You got me, man.

Okay?


[grunting,
fists pounding]

[grunts and pounding]

[grunts and thuds]

Better stop that
before you kill him!

You better get back
in your house, woman!


[continued kicking]

[heavy breathing]


[dog barking in distance]

[train whistling in distance]

Go lock up the stores.

[sobbing wildly]
Oh, God.

Oh, God, Dickie.

Ba-bro, get us a car.
Go get us a car!

Honey, we got to find him.

Oh, dear. Okay,
you look over here.

Ma'am, stop.
You can't go in there.

Over here.

Dickie? Dickie,
it's Roberta.

I'm right
here, honey.

Ma'am, you'll
have to leave.

Oh, my God!

What have they
done to you?

They're going to have to
take him to Duke Hospital.

[ambulance siren wailing]

No. No!

I ain't going to no
damn police station.

They ain't gonna listen
to a word I got to say.

Boo, I'll take you down.

Ain't nobody gonna
mess with us.

Who's on the desk?

Let me speak with him.

Dale.

Yeah, this is
Billy Watkins.

I understand there was
a shooting tonight

at, um,
Mr. Teel's store
out at Four Corners.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

He's with me.

I'll bring him in
a little later.

'Preciate it.

Do you still
have people
up in Berea?

Yeah.

Call 'em. Tell them
you're gonna
be staying

with 'em
for a while.

Well, what you
want me to do?

Go upstairs.

Get yourself
a pillowcase.

Fill it with all
the money you can
put your hands on.

You're gonna need it.

Excuse me, Sergeant.

This is
William Chavis.

He was
shot this evening
by Mr. Robert Teel.

Mr. Teel and his sons
killed Dickie Marrow.

It was witnessed
by Mr. Chavis

and he'd
like to report
that murder,

his own assault,
and swear out a warrant
for the Teels' arrest.

Have a seat.

Sorry.


All that time
he was in the service,

I prayed that nothing
would happen to him.

I prayed and prayed.

Somebody should've told me
I needed to be praying

he wouldn't get shot
in his own hometown.

Nothing I can do.

C'mon, Boo.
Let's go home.

John, I just heard.

What can I do?

It's too
late, Vernon.
Too late.

Go on home.

Oh, nice one.

So close.

Hey, where you been?

Home. Y'all hear?

Daddy, Roger, and them
shot them a nigger.

Why?

Said something
he shouldn't have
to Larry's wife Judy.

Tim Tyson.

Come in for supper.

What're we having?

I am not
announcing my menu
to the neighborhood.

Come in now.

[rumble of thunder]

Shh. It's only me.

Daddy.

Is everything
going to be okay?

Go to sleep,
little buck.

[indistinct shout]

Y'all, come on.


[shouting continues]

Let's go around back.

[siren approaches]

[shouting and noise fade]

Quiet, please.

This morning,
I dispatched a telegram
to the Governor's office

informing him
of the events
of last night,

as well as my intention
to declare the existence
of a state of emergency

and the imposing
of a curfew for
all citizens

from 7:30 in the evening
until 6 in the morning,
beginning tonight.

Further, I requested
from him the assistance
of State Troopers

to help enforce this curfew.

And most importantly,
to restore a safe, secure,

and law-abiding
environment for the
hearing tomorrow

and for the trial
in the months to come.

All citizens my ass!

Damn right.

That curfew
ain't nothing

but a No Niggers
After Nightfall Act.

That's right.

You can have...

whatever you can take.

Yeah.

That's right.

Yeah, Mr. Chavis.

But you can only keep--

what you can--

hold.

That's right.
We're gonna keep it!

Keep what, Darrel?

Beer? Cigarettes?
TV sets?

You think that's why
the State Troopers
are here?

Because you broke
some windows and
stole some groceries?

They're not.

You want to know
why they're here?

They're here
because last night,
when you hit those streets,

you took something
more valuable than you
could ever imagine.

Something our families have
been fighting for for years.

I'm talking about equality.

And they're not going to let
you keep it without a fight.

I ain't giving
it back.

Me, neither.

Good.

Mr. Chavis!

Mr. Chavis,
where you going?

What's going on?

Come on!
