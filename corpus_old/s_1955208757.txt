[crowd cheering]

<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to the 1958 World Cup</i>

<i>the greatest sporting event</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

<i>We are live in Gothenburg,</i>
<i>only moments away from</i>

<i>the start of the final match</i>
<i>of Group 4</i>

<i>Brazil versus</i>
<i>the Soviet Union.</i>

<i>It's so much more</i>
<i>than just a game for Brazil.</i>

<i>And with all their losses</i>
<i>in the last decade</i>

<i>the country's spirit</i>
<i>has been just crushed.</i>

<i>We've even seen some Brazilian</i>
<i>fans committing suicide</i>

<i>by jumping from the upper</i>
<i>tiers of the stadium.</i>

<i>But let's be honest,</i>
<i>the Soviets are the reigning</i>

<i>Olympic champions</i>
<i>and Brazil, I mean</i>

<i>Brazil should be counting</i>
<i>their blessings</i>

<i>they even qualified</i>
<i>for the World Cup.</i>

<i>Brazilians are about</i>
<i>to enter a stadium</i>

<i>filled with Europeans</i>
<i>all rooting against them.</i>

<i>They don't stand a chance.</i>

<i>They're young,</i>
<i>they're unorthodox</i>

<i>they got no discipline,</i>
<i>and they're mixed race to boot.</i>

<i>It's just sad really and now</i>
<i>with all their player injuries</i>

<i>they are forced to play</i>
<i>a 17-year-old reserve.</i>

<i>You almost have</i>
<i>to feel sorry for Brazil.</i>

<i>Lack of confidence has been a
real problem for the Brazilians</i>

<i>and starting a 17-year-old</i>
<i>is hardly the answer.</i>

<i>In fact, reports</i>
<i>from the locker room say</i>

<i>the teenager was sick</i>
<i>to his stomach</i>

<i>upon learning</i>
<i>he would be starting.</i>

<i>Not exactly the confidence</i>
<i>boost Brazil was hoping for.</i>

<i>The 1958 World Cup</i>
<i>in Sweden.</i>

<i>It's Brazil versus</i>
<i>the Soviet Union,</i>

<i>the World Cup debut for</i>
<i>17-year-old Edson Nascimento</i>

<i>the youngest player to ever</i>
<i>play in the tournament.</i>

<i>And Ullevi Stadium</i>
<i>is absolutely booming</i>

<i>50,000 screaming fans.</i>

<i>Millions more tuning in</i>
<i>from around the world.</i>

<i>In only a few moments,</i>
<i>it will be up to this youngster</i>

<i>and his South American</i>
<i>brothers to keep</i>

<i>their nation's hopes</i>
<i>and dreams alive.</i>

<i>Today, July 16th, 1950</i>

<i>perhaps the most important day</i>
<i>in our lifetimes</i>

<i>for only in a few hours' time,</i>
<i>11 of Brazil's</i>

<i>graceful warriors will play right here in Rio de Janeiro</i>

<i>at the newly-built</i>
<i>Maracana Stadium.</i>

<i>Brazil is tied to win</i>
<i>and the whole city has been</i>

<i>shut down to prepare</i>
<i>for celebrations</i>

<i>on a scale never before seen.</i>

<i>Come on, Dico, let's play!</i>
<i>Yeah, come on, Dico.</i>


I'm done shinin' shoes!

[Instrumental music]


[all laughing]

<i>We need a new ball!</i>

<i>Today's World Cup finals!</i>

<i>We bring you the even</i>
<i>bigger big event</i>

<i>you've all been waiting for!</i>

Welcome, <i>Senhoras e Senhores</i>

to the famous Rubens Arruda
street stadium!


<i>Today's very important game.</i>

Keepy uppy.
No, bounce!

[Instrumental music]

<i>Keepy uppy!</i>

[Music continues]

Over the roof.

I got this.

[Music continues]


<i>I got it!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

Keep away!

Come on, guys.

Get out of here.

<i>Dico!</i>

[Music continues]

[both grunting]

Ah, Zoca!

It was a bad pass
and Dico tripped.

<i>And the sun was in my eyes.</i>

<i>No fair!</i>

[All laughing]



Hmm.

[Clears throat]

I finished shining shoes
and was walking Zoca home

when he slipped
and fell in the river.

But you were playing
football!

<i>You should know better.</i>

You both go change and get back
to shining shoes.

But, mom,
what about the World Cup?!

<i>Don't even think about it.</i>
<i>The score is still tied 1-1!</i>

<i>The crowd in here is now</i>
<i>chanting, "Brazil must win!"</i>

<i>And here comes Brazil now</i>

<i>giving it everything</i>
<i>they've got.</i>

Go, go, just one, go.

-- <i>Here with a header!</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

<i>80 minutes in,</i>
<i>the match is still tied 1-1.</i>

<i>Over 200,000 fans now on their</i>
<i>feet, crammed into every seat.</i>

<i>Some eager fans are even</i>
<i>watching from their roof.</i>

<i>And Uruguay's Ruben Moran now</i>
<i>lines up for the quarter kick.</i>

<i>Here it is.</i>
<i>Uruguay shoots!</i>

Dico, Dico,
what's the score?

Still 1-1.
Final minutes.

He said still tied 1-1.

The match is winding down.
Fofinho.

Hey, guys!
What's the score?

Shh!

Get lost, Zoca.

I'll tell ma you were here,
listening to the World Cup.

Okay, just stay quiet.

<i>He shoots and it's goal!</i>
<i>Uruguay moves ahead.</i>

What happened, Dico?
What happened? Did we score?

Score against Brazil. 2-1.

<i>And now suddenly</i>
<i>all the pressure is on Brazil.</i>

Ugh!
Come on, Brazil.

<i>He's driving the ball forward as fast as he can!
Oh, no!</i>

<i>The final whistle.</i>
<i>We are defeated 21.</i>

<i>Brazil has lost</i>
<i>the 1950 World.</i>

<i>All 200,000 fans</i>

<i>have fallen</i>
<i>into a deafening silence.</i>

[Instrumental music]

<i>Come on, guys, let's go.</i>
<i>I thought we were gonna win.</i>



I'll win a World Cup
for Brazil, <i>pai. I promise.</i>

[Music continues]

If you're smart, Dico.

You listen to your mother.

You focus on school

and avoid the football
like the plague.

[Birds chirping]

Yes, I get it.
Football is romantic.

I should know.
I met your father at a game.

<i>5 goals he scored</i>
<i>with his head that day.</i>

Hmm.

Then we got married
and I told him

if he was so good with his head,
he wouldn't play football.

<i>They paid him nothing</i>
<i>and dropped him</i>

<i>as soon as he hurt his knee.</i>

No insurance,
no severance.

You think your father
wanted to be a janitor?

<i>Spend the rest of his life</i>
<i>scrubbing toilets?</i>

<i>Celeste!</i>

<i>Coming!</i>

Now, Dico, can I trust you
to finish this

so I can hang the wash?

[Door opens]

<i>The Bauru Youth Club?</i>

<i>Man, that tournament's</i>
<i>for street kids. Why bother?</i>

'Cause de Brito's
gonna be at the final.

Waldemar de Brito,
the scouts?

Yeah, it says here
he's looking for players

<i>for the Santos Football Club.</i>

Puxa! Once he sees me
play like Di Stefano!

I'm going pro, baby.

<i>Wait till he sees me</i>
<i>play like Puskas.</i>

And I'll be like Mazzola!

And I'll be like Pele!

Who the heck's "Pele"?

The goalkeeper for Vasco.

[All laughing]

Bile, <i>imbecil!</i>
His name's Bile!

<i>What idiot would think</i>
<i>Bile's name was Pele?</i>

<i>We can call this boy Pele.</i>

Hey, Pele, stop this shot!

Senhor Jose,
I'm sorry for my son.

Me? But he just --
Shh, Dico.

Shut your mouth.

I won't bring him again.

Hmm.

<i>"Copa da juventude</i>
<i>de Bauru."</i>

A tournament?
Are you crazy?

You promised <i>mae</i>
you'd be shining shoes!

Na! Zoca!

Maybe he's right, Dico.
What if your mom finds out?

Hey, come on.

Let's show these snobby
<i>riquinhos</i> how we play.

Fine, but I'm out.

<i>I don't want mae to kill me.</i>
<i>I'm innocent!</i>

Come on, let's do this!

<i>Welcome to Round 1</i>
<i>of the Bauru Youth Club.</i>


<i>Sign up here.</i>

<i>To me. I'm open!</i>

Why does it go so far?

It's full of air!

<i>Vai, Dico, vai!</i>


[instrumental music]



<i>Goal! 1-0.</i>

[Music continues]

<i>Vai, Dico, vai!</i>

That's the match.

<i>And on Field Number 1,</i>
<i>The Kings also advanced</i>

<i>to the second round.</i>

Kings!

<i>Sorry, they don't match.</i>

The only thing I had
were my mom's bed sheets.

Wait. You knit these?

Well, sewed technically.

Hey, your sewing
is pretty good, Yuri.

Yeah, I use a double hem.

<i>A little more.</i>

I guess I could
take this out a bit.

<i>Vai!</i>

Shirts make me feel
all trapped inside!

[Instrumental music]


<i>Goal!</i>


[music continues]

<i>A goal on Field Number 2.</i>

[Music continues]


Everyone's over there
watching the Kings.

<i>And final seconds now</i>
<i>on Field Number 1.</i>

Goal! And there's
the final whistle!

<i>The Kings win 8-0.</i>

<i>Come back tomorrow</i>
<i>for the finals</i>

<i>where the Kings will</i>
<i>take on Team Number 7.</i>

Hey, They are called
"The Shoeless Ones!"

[All laughing]

We need football boots.

Boots? How're we gonna
pay for boots?

[Speaking in Portuguese]

I got an idea.

[Man yelling]

Go!


Hurry! Hurry!
Throw it, under the fence!

Thiago!

<i>Go, Thiago!</i>

[Indistinct yelling]

Ladies and gentlemen!

Toasted! Salted!
Packed with vitamins!

Today's special!
Buy two get a free shine!

Free shoe shines!
Free shoe shines!

<i>Who wants a shine?</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>step right up!</i>

<i>Fresh from the Amazon!</i>
<i>Step right up!</i>

Peanuts! Peanuts!
Peanuts here.

Wow, he scrubs floors
and shines shoes!

Hey, Pele,
how much for a shine?

Don't call me that.
Or what?

Or you've got problems.
Who? Fatty and his sister?

Hey, Yuri is not a girl.

Then why is he knitting,
4 eyes?

[All laughing]

Sewing technically.

Throw it away.
<i>Now..</i>

How much for a shine, Pele?

[All gasping]



[indistinct yelling]

Your teacher did this to you?
Uh-huh.

Is this true, Zoca?

How dare she?

You and me are gonna
have a word

with that woman tomorrow
after school!

Tomorrow? No, I can't!

Uh, I mean,
you have work.

Celeste --

Let me talk to his teacher.

You go to work.

[Instrumental music]

You know..

...when I was your age,
I used to get in fights.

Especially when the older boys
called me names.

But with time, I learned,
a good player knows

that fighting comes
from insecurity.

The point is, Dico

if you wanna
play professionally

you can't be ashamed
of who you are.

<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

<i>Not only did he keep</i>
<i>the fight a secret</i>

but he knew all about
the tournament.

And he even said he hoped I'd
become a pro football player.

Wow, that's great, Dico.

What happened
to your glasses?

I don't want them
to call me names.

<i>Bingo!</i>
What? They're used.

And gigantic,
you kidding me?

Any other complaints?

<i>Senhoras e Senhores,</i>
<i>welcome to the final</i>

of the bout Juventude!

<i>Today's match, the Kings,</i>
<i>led by Captain Jose Altafini</i>

<i>versus The Shoeless Ones</i>

<i>led by Captain Pele!</i>

[Crowd laughing]

<i>Acalme! Hey! Acalma!</i>

They're just trying
to get you mad.

It's working.

<i>And please,</i>
<i>give a warm welcome</i>

to football legend
Waldemar de Brito!

<i>He is scouting for</i>
<i>the Santos Football Club!</i>

Wow.

<i>Teams, take the field.</i>

<i>Kings!</i>

Okay, everyone know
the plan?

When in doubt?
Do what they do!

Alright, boys.
May the best team win!

Block the angle!
Block it!

<i>Goal! Jose Altafini.</i>

<i>And the Kings,</i>
<i>off to a quick lead.</i>

<i>The Kings up, 2-0.</i>

Watch where you're going,
Thiago!

<i>The Shoeless Ones,</i>
<i>all tripped up!</i>

<i>Goal! The Kings</i>
<i>in perfect form!</i>

<i>A beautiful give-and-go!</i>

<i>Goal! Altafini 6-0.</i>

Nice moves, Pele.

Hey, hey, let it go.
It's not worth it.

<i>Acalme,</i> Dico.

[Instrumental music]

Dico, what are you doing?

<i>I hate these boots.</i>

[All laughing]

[laughter continues]

<i>Hey, Dico!</i>

[Instrumental music]

[music continues]

[crowd gasping]

<i>Goal! Goal! Goal!</i>

<i>Goal!</i>

<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>
<i>The Shoeless Ones!</i>

[Intense music]

[audience cheering]

Freedom! Yeah.

Okay.

Come on, come on,
no time to waste.

Let's go, let's go.
Come on, let's go.

<i>Senhoras e Senhores,</i>
<i>hold on to your hats.</i>

<i>Ten minutes still on the clock</i>
<i>in the second half.</i>

<i>Let's samba!</i>

[Percussive music]

<i>My, my!</i>

<i>Goal, Pele!</i>

<i>5 minutes still on the clock.</i>

[Music continues]

[indistinct chatter]

<i>G-G-Goal!</i>

<i>Oh my, what a move!</i>

Yuri!
I'm over here, I'm open.

Thiago!
Yuri!

<i>Caramba! Goal!</i>
<i>The Shoeless Ones!</i>

<i>Goal it is.</i>
<i>The Shoeless Ones again!</i>

<i>Down to one goal!</i>

Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

<i>And that's the final whistle.</i>

<i>The Kings win, 6-5.</i>

We should have
beat those guys.

Don't worry, Dico.
It's okay.

[Crowd chanting]

<i>Pele! Pele!</i>

Listen.

[Chanting continues]

<i>Wow.</i>

I bet you don't mind being
called Pele now!

<i>Hey, boys, come here.</i>

Say cheese.

[Shutter clicks]


[indistinct conversation]

Dico, Dico, Dico.

Guys, I think someone wants
their peanuts back.

Uh-oh.


[speaking in Portuguese]


Come back here!

I'm gonna get you!
<i>This way!</i>

[Thunder rumbling]

[indistinct shouting]

Hurry!

Come on, guys,
jump it.


Thiago!
Thiago, come on.

[Indistinct yell]

[intense music]

[speaking in Portuguese]

Come on! In here.

Down there, down there.

You okay?

I think it's sprained.

You could get outta here,
you know?

We're both getting
outta here.

Just give it
a minute to rest.

No, not the cave.

I mean, you could get out
of <i>here</i> here, Dico.

[Thunder rumbling]

<i>What you did today --</i>


<i>Come on!</i>
<i>It's gonna collapse!</i>

Help, Dico! Help!

Come on! Come on!
I can't! I'm stuck!


[thunder rumbling]

Help!

[Dramatic music]

<i>No, Thiago.</i>

No! Thiago!

Please!

[Music continues]

So we stole the peanuts
to buy football boots.

But if I hadn't said we needed
the stupid boots

Thiago wouldn't have died.

It's all my fault, <i>mae.</i>

I killed him.

I killed him.

<i>It's okay, Dico.</i>
<i>You didn't know.</i>

I'm gonna be good now, <i>mae.</i>

I'm gonna study
and do good in school.

I promise.

<i>Shh! Okay.</i>

[Instrumental music]

<i>"Waldemar de Brito,</i>
<i>football scout."</i>

I think it's time
he'll work with you

in the clinic after school.

[Indistinct chatter]

[indistinct radio chatter]

No!

That thing.
Just do this.

Yes.

[Toilet flushes]

Bloopers!

Yuck!

You know,
when I was a kid

I had a mango tree
just like that.

I taught myself

how to practice
with the fruit.

Green for shooting.

Ripe for finesse.


[instrumental music]


<i>Yuri! Yuri! Yuri, here!</i>


[music continues]

<i>Es culpa.</i>
<i>Es culpa.</i>

Ugh!

[Music continues]

[instrumental music]

<i>12 is to 4 as..</i>

[Music continues]



[music continues]



Nice and soft.

Okay?

Whoa! Soft.

Let's do it again.

Again.

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Whoa.</i>

<i>That's it.</i>

<i>Acalme. It's okay. Breathe.</i>

<i>Don't try so hard.</i>

<i>Just enjoy yourself.</i>

[Chuckles softly]

<i>Everything else will come.</i>

[Instrumental music]


Hey!

[Both laughing]

[music continues]

<i>Yes!</i>

[Both laughing]

<i>Yeah.</i>

[Music continues]

<i>That's it.</i>

Try that one.

<i>Good.</i>

Now this one.

It's way too high.

Do what comes natural to you.

[Music continues]


That's alright.

It'll come.


<i>No one can kick that</i>
<i>high except with the header.</i>

No, not a header.
With your feet.

<i>Tomorrow, I'll just</i>
<i>head something.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

[Both chuckling]

Hey, Dico!

<i>Dico.</i>

This is Mr. Waldemar de Brito.

How would you like to try out
for the Santos Football Group?

[Instrumental music]

Thank you, <i>mae.</i> Thank you.

[Birds chirping]

You've had enough, Maria.

Go help your brother
try on his new pants.

Okay. All set.

[Door creaking]

What's wrong, Dico?

I don't think
I can do this, Maria.

Maybe I should just say no.

<i>How'd you get the cake?</i>

<i>An advance</i>
<i>from Senhora</i> Altafina.

<i>How'd you acquire the pants?</i>

I took an advance
for the cleaning.

But <i>mae</i> bought you a cake.

Yeah, they're giving up

a lot for this, aren't they?

You're right.

We have to be strong
for them now.

He's only 15, Dondinho.

He's never even left Bauru.

Tchan tchan tchan tchan!

[Door opening]

<i>Zoca.</i>

I'll be back before
you know it, okay?

It's time to go.
I love you guys. Be good.

Go on, <i>meu filho.</i>

You go make us proud.

[Instrumental music]

<i>Stay safe, meu filho!</i>


Welcome to Santos!

<i>Each of you will be evaluated</i>

<i>based on your execution</i>

of proper form and discipline!

Number 1 and number 2.

There's no magic
in football, boys!

<i>Whatever primitive style</i>
<i>you played at home, forget it!</i>

<i>Here, you'll learn to master</i>
<i>the techniques</i>

of the best teams in Europe!

Oh, oh, oh, oh!

That's exactly
the kind of monkey business

I'm talking about!

Ball on the ground!

<i>Ball on the ground, boys!</i>

<i>Okay, okay!</i>
<i>Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>

<i>Okay, okay, okay,</i>
<i>back off, boys! Back off.</i>

<i>This is the list</i>
<i>for the pro team now.</i>

<i>For the pro team.</i>

<i>And here's the list</i>
<i>for the junior team, boys.</i>

<i>Junior team.</i>

Yeah! Whoo!

<i>And the youth team.</i>

<i>Okay,</i>
<i>congratulations, everyone.</i>

<i>Welcome to the club.</i>
<i>Now, shower up.</i>

<i>Come on, here we go!</i>

<i>"Edson 'Dico' Arantes</i>
<i>do Nascimento."</i>

<i>Now, the side-flip</i>
<i>is for accuracy.</i>

<i>But for power, use the instep</i>
<i>here, with the laces out.</i>

<i>Not the toe. Laces out.</i>

You see what happens when you
play with that primitive style?

<i>We lose.</i>

<i>Watch how Hungary beats us</i>
<i>in the '54 quarter final.</i>

<i>No showmanship,</i>
<i>no beating their mark.</i>

They just master
the formations.

[Indistinct chatter]

<i>Let's go, Dico!</i>
<i>Let's go, Dico!</i>

<i>Let's go!</i>
Man, let's go. Let's go.

<i>Come on, Dico! Come on, Dico!</i>

<i>Come on, Dico! Let's go!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

<i>Let's go, team!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

Laces out. Laces out.

[Instrumental music]

Come on, man.
Boy.

<i>He never scores.</i>


[instrumental music]

[music continues]

<i>Well, well.</i>

Leaving so soon?

Mr. De Brito?
What are you doing here?

I was going to ask
the same of you.

I'm no good, Mr. De Brito.

I can't play
like the other guys.

And if I don't
go back to school now

I'll end up cleaning toilets.

Mm-hmm.
And what's wrong with that?

Cleaning toilets?
No.

What's wrong with not playing

the way the other guys do?

Coach says the way
I play is primitive.

It is primitive.

It has a long and rich history.

Then why does coach hate it?

Well, uh..

...it all started

in the beginning
of the 16th Century.


Huh?
Come on.

If you don't wanna know,
I'll --

No, no, no, Mr. De Brito.
<i>I do wanna know.</i>

Please. Tell me.

Okay, like I was saying

it was the beginning
of the 16th Century.

<i>The Portuguese arrived</i>

<i>to Brazil with African slaves.</i>

<i>But the Africans' will</i>
<i>was strong.</i>

<i>And many escaped</i>
<i>to the jungle.</i>

<i>To protect themselves</i>

<i>the runaway slaves</i>

<i>called upon the ginga.</i>

<i>The foundation of Capoeira,</i>

<i>the martial art of war.</i>

<i>When slavery</i>
<i>was finally abolished</i>

<i>the Capoeiristas</i>
<i>came out of the jungle</i>

<i>only to find that Capoeira</i>

<i>was outlawed</i>
<i>throughout the land.</i>

<i>They saw football</i>
<i>as a perfect way</i>

<i>to practice the ginga</i>

<i>without being arrested.</i>

<i>It was the ultimate</i>
<i>form of ginga.</i>

<i>And before long</i>

<i>the ginga evolved, adapted</i>

<i>until it was</i>
<i>no longer just ours.</i>

<i>But the rhythm</i>
<i>within all Brazilians.</i>

<i>But by the 1950 World Cup</i>

<i>most believed</i>
<i>our ginga style</i>

<i>was to blame for the loss</i>

<i>and turned against</i>
<i>anything associated</i>

<i>with our African heritage.</i>

And just like your coach

has been trying to remove <i>ginga</i>

from your play..

...we've been trying
to remove it from our self

as a people ever since.

But the <i>ginga</i>
is very strong in you, Dico.

So you can
either show us what happens

when you have the courage

to embrace who you truly are.

Or you can get on that train..

...and you will never know.

[Train chugging]

[indistinct shouting]

[instrumental music]


<i>Keep it moving, boys!</i>
<i>Let's go! Come on!</i>

<i>Go get ahead!</i>

[Whistle blows]

<i>I said move up, Joao!</i>

<i>Hey, hey! Whoa!</i>

[Whistle blows]

[music continues]

<i>Francis! It's yours!</i>

<i>Nascimento stay back!</i>


Open your eyes!

<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Get up! Let's go!</i>


<i>Come on! Get up!</i>
<i>Let's go, boy!</i>

[Instrumental music]

Wait for the formation!

[Music continues]

[whistle blows]

<i>Goal!</i>

[All cheering]

<i>Hey, kid!</i>

Get over here!

What the hell was that?

I'm sorry.

Do it again.

[Percussive music]

"Santos, Cubatao,
Edson Nascimento, 4 goals."

<i>You the kid</i>
<i>that scored 4 goals?</i>

Zito, midfielder.
Pro team.

So, uh..

You know what the best part
of scoring 4 goals is?

You get to run out
and bring me coffee.

Ancient Santos tradition.

[Coin clatters]


And put some gas into it, huh?

<i>The youngster,</i>
<i>Edson Arantes do Nascimento</i>

<i>nicknamed Dico</i>

<i>moved up</i>
<i>to the junior team after</i>

<i>a few unbelievable matches</i>

<i>at the youth level.</i>

<i>Oh! What a move!</i>

<i>He passes one! That's another!</i>

<i>Now through the middle!</i>
<i>The shot!</i>

<i>Goal!</i>


[singing in foreign language]

<i>You're not there, kid.</i>

<i>That's the wrong list, Dico.</i>

<i>Welcome to the pros.</i>

<i>From a kid who,</i>
<i>as word has it, was on the verge</i>

<i>of being cut</i>
<i>from the youth team.</i>

<i>And now, suddenly,</i>
<i>top scorer of the pro team</i>

<i>halfway through the season.</i>

<i>Fans now starting</i>
<i>to come out in hordes.</i>

<i>As Santos racks up the wins,</i>
<i>everyone eager to watch</i>

<i>the 15-year-old phenom</i>

and his magical style of play.

<i>Oh my! This kid</i>
<i>is something else! A fake!</i>

<i>Another fake!</i>
<i>Now he's back the other way!</i>

<i>He ditches off of Zito!</i>

<i>Back to Nascimento. He's got</i>
<i>himself into a pickle now!</i>

<i>Three defenders.</i>
<i>He changes direction.</i>

<i>No, no! Wait a minute!</i>
<i>He's still got the ball!</i>

<i>From outside the box!</i>
<i>Goal!</i>


Yes?
Delivery for Dona Celeste.

For me?
There must be a mistake.

It's a gift, <i>mae!</i>

Dico!
<i>Dico!</i>

Dico! Dico, Dico!
Maria.

Hey!
Hey, buddy!

<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

[Speaking in foreign language]

<i>It's going in my room</i>
<i>because there's more space.</i>

<i>Don't touch the stove, Maria.</i>
<i>Where's the fire?</i>

Hey, hey, it's not a toy.

You do realize there is
no gas in Bauru, right?

Don't break their hearts.

We can just use it as a table.


For you, <i>pai!</i>

Hey! Whoa! Wow!
<i>It's a radio.</i>

Yeah. I know what it is.

Now you can
listen to my games.

<i>Oh, no, no, not in my house.</i>

Listen to your games?

Are you trying to give your
mother a heart attack?

We can listen to Team Brazil
invitations tomorrow!

Don't you listen, Zoca.
Aah, <i>mae!</i>

Besides, you have school
and your father works.

Oh, <i>mae!</i>

<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>nothing to you?</i>

Come on, Maria. I'm 16.

There's no way
I'm making the selection.

Mm-hmm. He's right.

No point to listen..

...just to be disappointed.

<i>Radio Bandeirantes announces</i>
<i>the list of invitations</i>

<i>to the national selection.</i>

<i>22 of our very best</i>
<i>pro players</i>

<i>to represent Brazil</i>
<i>in the 1958 World Cup</i>

<i>and here they are.</i>

<i>Gilmar. Bellini.</i>
<i>Djalma Santos.</i>

<i>Didi. Zagallo. Garrincha.</i>
<i>Nilton Santos.</i>

<i>Orlando. Zito. Vava.</i>

<i>Castilho and Mazzola,</i>
<i>who at 19 years old</i>

<i>would be</i>
<i>the youngest member selected.</i>

<i>But also making the list,</i>
<i>16-year-old Dico Nascimento.</i>


What's going on out there?

Dico? You look sick.
Are you okay?


<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

<i>Top scorer gets coffee?</i>

<i>The youngest player</i>
<i>gets lunch?</i>

And the shortest
cleans the showers.

Yep. Always
the Santos traditions.

Man.

You think maybe Zito
was making them up?

But, man, that's incredible.

You're playing with Zito
and the pro team.

It's not the same
as with you guys.

I miss Thiago.

Me too.

Where's Fofinho?

We robbed a store.
What?

I got away, but Fofinho
got one year in jail.

Yuri.
I know. I know.

<i>It's just -- you know</i>
<i>how things go around here.</i>

Hey, but I've been listening
to all your games.

I still can't believe
you made the selection.

You heard?

It's pretty much the greatest
thing that ever happened to us.

We're all going to be
pulling for you out there.

[Instrumental music]

<i>That was a critical time</i>
<i>for our country, meu filho.</i>

Ever since we lost
the cup in '50

we've become ashamed.

The spirit
of our people is dying.

<i>But now you</i>
<i>can change all that.</i>

I had Yuri
stitch it on for you.

<i>Pele?</i>

Yeah.

But that's what
those rich kids

called me to make fun of me.

No.

It's what the people called you

when they saw you
play with <i>ginga.</i>

And when I saw you
had something I did not.

Years ago, Dico

[thunder rumbles]

<i>when I first became</i>
<i>a professional footballer..</i>

[Indistinct shouting]

<i>...I wanted to play</i>
<i>with the ginga</i> so beautiful

<i>Brazilians would</i>
<i>erupt with pride.</i>

<i>But when I finally got my shot</i>

<i>I was filled with doubt.</i>


[crowd gasping]

<i>And it ended my career.</i>

But why?

Because I stopped believing.

Doubt can turn
a beautiful <i>ginga</i> move

into a dangerous one.

<i>But you have to be stronger</i>
<i>than I was, Dico.</i>

When people say mean things
about you and how you play

you must never feel --

Ashamed, <i>pai.</i>
I got it. <i>Calma.</i>

[Bus horn honking]

[instrumental music]

<i>Tickets, please!</i>
<i>Rio de Janeiro!</i>

Stay strong, <i>meu filho.</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

[instrumental music]

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Watch this. Watch this.

So, you're that kid that thinks
he can dribble like me, huh?

Hmm, then you've got style.

[Both laughing]

<i>The name's Garrincha.</i>
<i>Hi. Dico.</i>

This is Castilho.
Castilho. Hey.

That's Mauro.

Hey, Mauro. Dico.

Vava.
Hey, Vava.

Uh, Zito you know, right?
Yeah.

[Speaking in Portuguese]


<i>Hey, Zito.</i>
And Didi.

See you on the bench, kid.

The bench? But coach hasn't
picked the lineups yet.

Uh, you sure about that?

There's your competition.

<i>Mazzola.</i>

Good luck convincing coach
to start you over him.

<i>Wow! He scrubs floors</i>
<i>and shines shoes.</i>

Pele.

<i>And I'll be like Mazzola.</i>

It's Jose Altafini.

Yeah. But he goes by Mazzola.

'Cause he says
he plays just like

the legendary Italian striker.

Well, my family's Italian

and I was trained
in that style of play.

So I am confident I will bring

some of the sophistication
and class

some others
of the team may lack.

[Reporters clamoring]

Garrincha, do you really
think your <i>ginga</i> style

<i>will hold up against</i>
<i>the Europeans?</i>

I..

I don't see what's so bad
about <i>ginga.</i>

Listen! Listen! It's okay.
<i>Silencio! Silencio!</i>

<i>Okay, okay, listen.</i>

<i>No one here</i>
<i>wants to relive 1950.</i>

I can assure you that
this team will be civilized

both on and off the field.

We will only show
our best face in Sweden.

Alright. Let's take the photo!

[Reporters clamoring]

[indistinct chatter]

<i>Brazil is at a crossroads.</i>

<i>We either go down</i>
<i>in history as the savages</i>

<i>or we enter the ranks</i>
<i>of the civilized.</i>

The President spoke those words
to me this morning.

And I promised him

that this team,
that my team

unlike those of the past

would not make fools
of ourselves and Brazil.

And you --

You may be 16 years old

but you are now a sportsman
for this great nation.

<i>Ginga</i> style might have worked
for you back in Santos

but it will never hold up
at an international level.

But, coach --
I don't wanna hear it!

It won't happen again.

<i>Say it.</i>

It won't happen again.

What?!
It won't happen again.

Get him a haircut
and some proper clothes.

<i>According to insider reports</i>

<i>Coach Feola is struggling</i>
<i>with his new recruits</i>

<i>during their</i>
<i>first month of practices.</i>

<i>But since fans called</i>
<i>for replacing virtually</i>

<i>the entire team</i>
<i>after the disaster of 1950</i>

<i>and the disgrace of '54</i>

<i>the coach was left</i>
<i>with few options</i>

<i>outside of inexperienced</i>
<i>and unconventional players.</i>

<i>The bulky midfielder, Zito</i>

<i>bent-legged striker,</i>
<i>Mane Garrincha.</i>

<i>And the youngster,</i>
<i>Dico Nascimento</i>

<i>who made headlines</i>
<i>last month for his outburst</i>

<i>at the inaugural banquet much</i>
<i>to the chagrin of Coach Feola.</i>

<i>Teaching Brazilians to play the</i>
<i>same disciplined formations</i>

<i>of the European teams</i>
<i>seems challenging enough.</i>

<i>But the coaching staff appears</i>
<i>to also be encouraging</i>

<i>a more refined</i>
<i>presentation off the field.</i>

<i>Why all the fuss?</i>

It's about
changing that image.

We don't want
to arrive in Sweden

and have the world say,
"Oh, there's Brazil."

Yes. But you are Brazilian,
aren't you?

No.
You're not listening.

I'm-I'm talking about the way
others see us and how we play.

<i>Then how do you account</i>
<i>for the reports</i>

<i>of the team playing lousy</i>
<i>in practices?</i>

Certain players still are not
up to international standards.

<i>And you think they can be</i>
<i>by Sweden?</i>

Maybe we're lousy

'cause we're not playing
the way we know how.

I really hope
you're not saying

what I think you're saying.

I mean, what if we just
didn't get it right in '50?

All I know is that coach

picks the starting lineup today.

Show him you can play
the way Jose plays

and you might have a shot.

But if you play with <i>ginga --</i>

I know, it's just my dad..

Your dad what?

Nothing. Forget it.

[Indistinct chatter]

[indistinct shouting]

[whistle blows]

<i>I want to see good,</i>
<i>clean football, boys!</i>

<i>Short, sharp passes!</i>

[Speaking in foreign language]

<i>You've got Vava on the wing!</i>

<i>Cross to the wing!</i>

<i>Take it from him!</i>
<i>Take it!</i>

<i>Alright now! Spread it out,</i>
<i>move! Here we go!</i>

<i>Zito! You gotta block</i>
<i>that out!</i>

<i>Keep the ball moving here!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

[Upbeat music]

<i>Nascimento!</i>

<i>No! No!</i>
<i>What are you thinking?</i>



<i>Dico!</i>

<i>Dico!</i>



<i>Breathe.</i>


<i>Dico?</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>

I had a small collision.

<i>What?</i>

<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>Dico?</i>

It's my knee.

<i>It's my knee, mae.</i>

<i>They don't know when</i>
<i>I can play again.</i>

What happened?

<i>I should have</i>
<i>stayed in school.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry, mae.</i>

No, Dico.

Dico?

We made that choice together.

And it was the right choice.

Your father and I
love you no matter what.

<i>Te amo, mae.</i>

[Speaking in Portuguese]

[instrumental music]

<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

<i>Deep breaths.</i>

Hey!

It's still too swollen to say.

Keep ice on it for a few days.

And then

he can play?

Maybe next season.

<i>I am so sorry.</i>

<i>We'll take another look</i>
<i>in Sweden.</i>

<i>If he's going.</i>

<i>It's too late</i>
<i>to replace him now.</i>

<i>Start him on rehabilitation.</i>

Better bag some ice
for the flight.

Shh! Everyone quiet!
This is it!

<i>In our World Cup</i>
<i>will be, Brazil.</i>

<i>Brazil's struggled immensely</i>
<i>with their team's image</i>

<i>ever since they lost in 1950.</i>

<i>Then in '54 shamefully stormed</i>
<i>their opponent's locker room</i>

<i>with broken bottles after</i>
<i>losing in the quarter-finals.</i>

<i>The big question now was could</i>
<i>they remake themselves?</i>

<i>Well, they brought in</i>
<i>Coach Vicente Feola</i>

<i>for just that purpose.</i>

<i>And the reports we've received</i>

<i>have really</i>
<i>surprised the world.</i>

<i>It appears Brazil</i>
<i>hasn't learned their lesson.</i>

<i>Earlier this week,</i>
<i>we heard about</i>

<i>players injuring themselves</i>
<i>using that same</i>

<i>untrained street style</i>
<i>that failed them in 1950.</i>

<i>Clearly Feola wasn't</i>
<i>man enough for the task.</i>

<i>Expect Group 4 to go to the Soviet Union,</i>

<i>Ticket queue stretching</i>

<i>Last to arrive is Team Brazil</i>

<i>But not as favored</i>

<i>There they are!</i>

<i>Stars Gunnar Gren,</i>

<i>Nils Liedholm, Agne Simonsson.</i>

<i>And it seems one lucky reporter has scored an interview</i>

<i>with everyone's</i>
<i>favorite left-winger</i>

<i>Lennart "Nacka" Skoglund.</i>

Nacka, how's your team
feeling?

Perfect. It is our country,
our fans and our time to shine.

How about Mexico?

Well, no team
from outside Europe's

ever won the cup
on the European soil.

Do you really think Mexico

or these misfits there
will ever change that?

<i>Let's see what Team Brazil</i>
<i>has to say for themselves.</i>

<i>It is fortunate</i>
<i>these young athletes</i>

<i>play with their feet.</i>

<i>Because it would appear</i>
<i>the cat's got</i>

<i>this one's tongue.</i>

<i>And stay tuned</i>
<i>for a special report</i>

Bunch of fascists,
if you ask me.

<i>They even got a King.</i>
<i>Gustaf VI Adolf.</i>

I mean, who's got a number
in the middle of their name?


Hey, hey, hey, <i>calma.</i>

Drink, it'll help with the pain.

<i>I added some of my special</i>
<i>herbs to speed up the healing.</i>

<i>We'll teach that white doctor</i>

<i>to doubt the ancient arts.</i>

The referees here keep
the ball after every game.

Do you believe that?

I'll be damned if they keep
the winning ball this time.

That ball's coming home with me
whether they like it or not.

[Instrumental music]

<i>The referee signals</i>
<i>and the first match</i>

<i>of Group 4 is underway!</i>

<i>Brazil versus Austria.</i>

<i>That's Holla out</i>
<i>to right wing Walter Horak</i>

<i>Austria, of course,</i>
<i>not as strong</i>

<i>as they were 4 years ago</i>
<i>when they took Bronze</i>

<i>in the '54 cup.</i>

[Music continues]

[indistinct commentary on TV]

<i>Earlier today, Brazil pulled</i>
<i>off a surprising upset</i>

<i>against Austria in Group 4.</i>

Gentlemen! Let's go
out to the field.

<i>And here in Group 3, Sweden</i>
<i>trouncing Mexico, 3 to nil.</i>

<i>I have to admit,</i>

<i>it looks a lot better</i>
<i>than I expected.</i>

But it's still extremely weak.

So you'll clear him?

It'll be excruciatingly
painful for him.

I'll take that as a yes.
We should talk about this.

Get him on his feet.
It's too dangerous.

Even the slightest attack --

<i>At Rasunda Stadium,</i>
<i>Sweden continues to dominate</i>

<i>with a 2-0 win</i>
<i>over Hungary today</i>

<i>securing their place</i>
<i>in the quarterfinals.</i>

<i>And in Group 4,</i>
<i>Brazil, a heavy underdog</i>

<i>coming into the tournament</i>
<i>managed to edge out</i>

<i>Austria in their first match</i>

<i>then survived England</i>
<i>in a scoreless tie.</i>

<i>The first we've seen</i>
<i>in World Cup history.</i>

<i>The match was</i>
<i>a proper bloodbath</i>

<i>leaving three of Brazil's</i>
<i>starting players injured.</i>

<i>Joel, Dino Sani, and striker</i>

<i>Jose Altafini,</i>
<i>nicknamed "Mazzola"</i>

<i>who's leg injury</i>
<i>will prevent him</i>

<i>from playing in today's match</i>
<i>against the Soviet Union.</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

Come on, Joao.

<i>The Soviets</i>
<i>are big and aggressive.</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

Easy, Zoca!

<i>Only started</i>
<i>one black player before today.</i>

<i>But these injuries</i>
<i>will force his hand.</i>

<i>And we've just received word</i>
<i>that Feola will give the nod</i>

<i>to defensive midfield reserve,</i>
<i>Zito</i>

<i>bent-legged right winger,</i>
<i>Garrincha</i>

<i>and 17-year-old</i>
<i>Edson Nascimento</i>

<i>who comes in</i>
<i>to replace Mazzola.</i>

<i>And who apparently is himself</i>

<i>recovering from</i>
<i>a sprained knee.</i>


Let's go.
Pull yourself together!

You cannot go
on camera like this.

Caralho!

<i>Clean yourself up.</i>

Come on. You've got
to stand up straight!

Up straight!

<i>Try to look older than you are</i>
<i>for once, for God's sake.</i>

You watch Didi
and Zagallo for the shifts.

<i>You've seen Mazzola run them.</i>

And lace your goddamn boots up!

<i>Hey, Dico, there you are.</i>

Listen, you must protect
that knee at all costs.

It's very weak.

And don't even
think about <i>ginga.</i>

<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

Lace up your boots. Are you
trying to get yourself killed?

Let's go.

[Instrumental music]

[instrumental music]

[indistinct commentary on PA]

[crowd cheering]

<i>See, the way it works</i>
<i>is they are here to see us.</i>

Not the other way around.
Come on. Field's this way.

You might wanna think about
tying those.

<i>This marks the first</i>
<i>World Cup appearance</i>

<i>for Mane Garrincha.</i>

<i>There's our trusty</i>
<i>midfielder, Didi</i>

<i>who towers over</i>
<i>the young Dico Nascimento.</i>

<i>He is dwarfed</i>
<i>by even his teammates.</i>

<i>Clearly the youngest player</i>
<i>they've seen in a lineup.</i>

<i>And the crowd here having</i>
<i>a grand time at his expense.</i>

Don't listen to them, Dico.

[Indistinct shouting]


[crowd booing]

[breathing nervously]


<i>The Soviet Union very</i>
<i>physical out of the gates!</i>

<i>It's almost as if they're</i>
<i>playing pinball</i>

<i>with the smaller Brazilians</i>
<i>and enjoying it!</i>

<i>Our heroes now see a hole</i>
<i>in the Soviet defense.</i>

<i>Garrincha pops one</i>
<i>through the middle.</i>

<i>The shot, goal! Goal!</i>

<i>Brazil takes the lead,</i>
<i>1 to 0!</i>

<i>A stroke of luck for Coach Feola and Team Brazil!</i>

<i>The middle changes</i>
<i>in the Brazilian lineup</i>

<i>seem to have confused</i>
<i>the Soviets.</i>

<i>And newcomers Garrincha</i>
<i>and Vava capitalize</i>

<i>unlike the young Nascimento.</i>

<i>The Soviets have really</i>
<i>had their way with him.</i>

<i>He'll have to do a better job</i>
<i>to stay out of their way</i>

<i>if he intends to walk out</i>
<i>of here on his own two feet.</i>

[Indistinct commentaries]

[indistinct yelling]

<i>Dico! Dico!</i>

<i>And there's another</i>
<i>missed pass for Brazil.</i>

<i>But nonetheless,</i>
<i>the Soviets have</i>

<i>yet to capitalize</i>
<i>on these turnovers.</i>

<i>And with only a few minutes</i>
<i>remaining in the match</i>

<i>it appears Brazil may just edge away with this one</i>

<i>which would pit them</i>
<i>against France</i>

<i>in next week's semi-final.</i>

[Crowd cheering]


Hey! Hey!
Hey!

<i>And the crowd wanted a whistle
on that push from Nascimento</i>

<i>who shows his frustration</i>
<i>after losing the ball.</i>

<i>He hesitated</i>
<i>on his dribble there.</i>

<i>The kind of mistake that can</i>
<i>easily lead to injury.</i>

<i>And here's France now,</i>
<i>Raymond Kopa</i>

<i>lays one out</i>
<i>for Just Fontaine.</i>

<i>Fontaine passes it on. Goal!</i>


<i>A goal for France.</i>

<i>We are on the boards first</i>
<i>with the goal from Vava</i>

<i>but now France strikes back</i>

<i>and that has got</i>
<i>to demoralize Brazil.</i>

<i>As the teams head</i>
<i>to the locker rooms</i>

<i>after a very physical</i>
<i>first half.</i>

<i>When I say 4-2-4,</i>
<i>I mean 4-2-4.</i>

<i>No 4-3-3, you understand?</i>

<i>If you understand</i>
<i>what I'm saying, then you say</i>

"Yes, coach, I'll do it.
Can you say it?

Yes, coach, I'll do it.

<i>Eso.</i>

<i>Look. You wait for the set,</i>
<i>then you release.</i>

<i>Where's the center line?</i>
<i>Where is it?</i>

<i>Not tomorrow, today!</i>

<i>Come on! Up! Up!</i>

<i>Let's go! We only get one shot here.</i>
<i>Let's make it count.</i>

I can't play like you.

If your leg is better,
you should go back in.

It's not my leg.

<i>My head is not right.</i>

Your head?

My whole life

all I ever wanted
was to be European.

<i>Since we've got here,</i>
<i>I realize that</i>

I'm Brazilian

and always will be.

That day back in Bauru

you showed everyone
that they're part of us.

The ginga

<i>it was beautiful.</i>

That's what we need now.

<i>The World Cup semi-final.</i>

<i>France and Brazil</i>
<i>neck and neck</i>

<i>at the start</i>
<i>of the second half.</i>

<i>Today's winner will advance</i>
<i>to Sunday's final</i>

<i>where they will</i>
<i>likely face Sweden.</i>

<i>France, of course,</i>
<i>favored over Brazil</i>

<i>the only team from outside</i>
<i>Europe still in competition.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

[Crowd roaring]


[upbeat music]

Watch the knee!
The knee!

Stay back! Stay back!

[Music continues]

[all cheering]

<i>Goal, Brazil!</i>

<i>What a drive</i>
<i>and what a finish!</i>

<i>The 17-year-old</i>
<i>with a humdinger of a shot</i>

<i>giving Brazil a leg-up</i>
<i>in this second half!</i>

<i>Garrincha now approaching</i>
<i>the area,</i>

<i>knocked away by Jonquet.</i>

<i>A loose ball in,</i>
<i>Brazil comes away with it!</i>

<i>Brazil turning the tides</i>

<i>now advancing the ball</i>
<i>back downfield.</i>

<i>That's Didi feeding the ball</i>
<i>down the middle.</i>

<i>It's a chip.</i>
<i>Nascimento shoots! Goal!</i>

<i>Goal! Goal!</i>

<i>Goal, Brazil!</i>

<i>The young Nascimento comes up</i>

<i>with two dazzling goals</i>
<i>back to back!</i>

[All cheering]

<i>And now the youngster</i>
<i>is back at it</i>

<i>right over Marcel!</i>

<i>A touch and some kind of double fake.</i>
<i>Never seen that before.</i>

<i>Marcel grabbing</i>
<i>at the lad's shirt.</i>

<i>And now he makes Piantoni!</i>

<i>Orlando letting it</i>
<i>roll by to Vava!</i>

<i>A little touch to the give and go back to Nascimento.</i>

<i>He stepped right over it!</i>

<i>Kaelbel didn't even</i>
<i>see it go by!</i>

<i>He shoots!</i>
<i>It's a goal! Goal, Brazil!</i>

<i>Goal, Nascimento!</i>

<i>An other-worldly display</i>
<i>by the 17-year-old phenom!</i>

<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen</i>

<i>Brazil is on their way</i>
<i>to the 1958 World Cup final!</i>

He's fine.

And, uh, he scored three goals.

Listen up.
I got four days to get you in shape for the final.

<i>Everyone take notes.</i>

Sweden has been shifting
from Pyramid

5-3-2 to 3-2-2-3.

And sometimes
to <i>metodo</i> 2-3-2-3.

We play straight 4-2-4.

But if we're gonna
beat these guys

we're gonna have to shift
formation as they do.

<i>And this is how</i>
<i>we're gonna do it.</i>

If they go to 5-3-2,
then we go to 3-4-3!

<i>Let's go. Next!</i>

<i>Whatever they run,</i>
<i>with the method of 3-2-3</i>

<i>we match with the 4-3-3.</i>

There's nobody
in the field over here.

Vada! Vada!

Everybody is here
and nobody is here!

Never follow. Not ever.

<i>But, coach, isn't that</i>
<i>their shift to 3-4-3?</i>

<i>No. Skoglund sweeps to start</i>
<i>Sweden's counterattack.</i>

<i>Didi, sweep only.</i>

What is that? I said 4-5-1!
Didi slide over!

<i>You're running the 4-5-1!</i>

Garrincha, roll out! You gotta
be ready for that on the wing!

Coach?
<i>What?</i>

I don't understand how
I'm supposed to be on the wing

and covering Skoglund
at the same time.

Because you --

<i>The Swedes have the edge over
Brazil in almost every regard.</i>

<i>Experience, sophistication,</i>
<i>strategy and strength</i>

<i>and even dirty play.</i>

<i>Last week, we saw</i>
<i>West German captain</i>

<i>Fritz Walter's illustrious</i>
<i>career come to an end</i>

<i>after this severe collision</i>

<i>with Swedish midfielder</i>
<i>Sigge Parling.</i>

<i>Well, come Sunday's final</i>

<i>expect Parling's sights</i>
<i>to be set on</i>

<i>the young Edson Nascimento.</i>

<i>Nascimento scored</i>
<i>an impressive hat-trick</i>

<i>in 20 minutes in the semi-final against France.</i>

<i>Coach Raynor, any concern</i>
<i>he'll do the same</i>

<i>against Sweden</i>
<i>in Sunday's final?</i>

No, no.
That's not possible.

No. Our boys will eliminate him
from the equation.

<i>Coach Feola,</i>
<i>Coach Raynor's offense</i>

outsmarted West Germany,
Hungary.

Do you have any plans
to contain them?

Well --
They can't.

[All laughing]

We will come out strong,
score early

and Brazil will panic

just like they did in 1950.

<i>They were undisciplined then</i>
<i>and they are undisciplined now.</i>

But what do you expect?
They're abnormal.

You're referring
to their mixed race?

No. I mean they are literally
abnormal.

<i>Can you elaborate?</i>

Well, yes, in fact, I can.

Djalma Santos, full back.

<i>He mangled his hand</i>
<i>in an accident</i>

<i>while working in a factory</i>
<i>as a teenager.</i>

<i>The right winger, Garrincha,</i>
<i>born with a deformed spine</i>

<i>and one leg shorter</i>
<i>than the other.</i>

<i>The reserve, Castilho</i>

<i>he's colorblind</i>
<i>and missing a finger.</i>

Challenging for a goalkeeper,
I imagine.

[All laughing]

[indistinct chatter]

<i>I heard about</i>
<i>the press conference.</i>

<i>Everyone here</i>
<i>is really down about it.</i>

But this is exactly
what happened in '50.

You can't let the doubt
get to you.

<i>I heard the guys</i>
<i>are calling you Pele now.</i>

Yeah. Jose started it.
It's silly.

This is a sign.

Now is the time for Pele.

But Sweden's gonna be
all over me, <i>pai.</i>

And did you see what they did
to Fritz Walter?

They're brutal.

And smart.

<i>Dico.</i>

You believed in yourself
against France.

<i>Now you must inspire your team</i>

<i>to believe in themselves..</i>

<i>...in Brazil..</i>

<i>...in the ginga.</i>

Hey, Garrincha!

What the heck, Pele?

Hey! Lighthouse, no bounce!

Come on, kid!
Time to wake up. Take a seat.

Have some breakfast.

You won't be able
to do it alone.

<i>Zito, come on.</i>

[Talking indistinctly]

<i>Hey, where did that ball go?</i>

Come on, guys.

<i>To the lighthouse.</i>

[Instrumental music]

[indistinct yelling]

<i>Nice one.</i>

[Speaking in Portuguese]

[music continues]


[woman speaking
in foreign language]

<i>Anyone see it fall?</i>

<i>Not me!</i>

<i>Keepy uppy!</i>

<i>Alright! Game on!</i>

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

<i>Let's go!</i>



I'm sorry, sir.

Wake up, kid.
To the lighthouse!


<i>Yeah!</i>

<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

<i>Outside!</i>

<i>Calma. You can do it.</i>

<i>Long ball!</i>

<i>Didi! You got Pele long!</i>

<i>Run, Pele!</i>
<i>Get there! Jump!</i>

I can't swim!

I got you, Pele!

I got you.

<i>Grab my hand.</i>
<i>Here you go.</i>


We were so close!

[Indistinct chatter]


Here he comes.

You see?
That's how it's done.

Tomorrow you will play
for the Jules Rimet trophy.

And if you play the way
you played this last week

you will lose.

And it will be my fault.

The truth is that
shifting formations

may work miracles for Sweden

but it is not us.

What I saw at the hotel today

that's how we play.

They say that we don't all play
the same. It's true.

We certainly don't all
look the same like they do.

[Faint laughter]

But that's what makes us
who we are.

We have one thing in common.

The ginga.

The joy and expression
of Brazil.


So when you take
the field tomorrow

forget everything that
I told you this last week.

I don't want the world to see
a bunch of scared Brazilians

trying to play like Sweden.

I want them to see Brazil,
just as we are.

I don't know if we will win

but I do know

that we will show them
a beautiful game.

What are you all
sitting around for?

I did not say that
practice was canceled!

[All cheering]

<i>Let's go, Brazil!</i>
<i>Alright.</i>

<i>After a night of heavy rains,</i>
<i>it's a brisk summer morning</i>

<i>with clear skies</i>
<i>here in Stockholm.</i>

<i>Fine weather for football</i>

<i>as Sweden prepares to host</i>
<i>the 1958 World Cup final.</i>

<i>The Nordic Titans of Europe</i>
<i>will take on</i>

<i>the less-experienced</i>
<i>but ever-flamboyant Brazil.</i>

<i>Two teams</i>
<i>with nothing in common</i>

<i>other than, perhaps,</i>
<i>their yellow jerseys.</i>

<i>But of course,</i>
<i>per the King's decree</i>

<i>Brazil will be forced</i>
<i>to wear blue today</i>

<i>against the heavily-favored</i>
<i>home nation.</i>

<i>How many goals</i>
<i>will Sweden win by?</i>

<i>No one can say.</i>

<i>But everyone agrees</i>

<i>Brazil will need nothing</i>
<i>short of a miracle</i>

<i>to take home</i>
<i>the Jules Rimet trophy.</i>

[Instrumental music]

<i>Over 50,000 already</i>
<i>in attendance</i>

<i>and millions more tuning in</i>
<i>from around the world</i>

<i>for the biggest</i>
<i>sporting event on earth.</i>

<i>No team from outside Europe</i>

<i>has ever won the cup</i>
<i>on European soil.</i>

<i>But that doesn't stop the rest</i>
<i>of the world from watching</i>

<i>and hoping that one day</i>
<i>that may change.</i>

<i>There's the King of Sweden,</i>
<i>Gustav VI Adolf</i>

<i>with Queen Mountbatten</i>
<i>arriving in their box.</i>

<i>And now the entrance</i>
<i>of our host, Team Sweden.</i>

<i>British-born manager,</i>
<i>George Raynor,</i>

<i>pulled players</i>
<i>from not just Sweden</i>

<i>but other European countries.</i>

<i>A bit of a European</i>
<i>all-star team, really.</i>

<i>And on the other side</i>
<i>Coach Feola and Team Brazil.</i>

<i>And there's our young star</i>
<i>Nascimento</i>

<i>now being called "Pele"</i>
<i>by his teammates.</i>

<i>Fofinho, it's Pele!</i>

<i>But make no mistake.</i>

<i>Brazil will need</i>
<i>the rest of the team</i>

<i>to step up today against</i>
<i>the indomitable Swedes.</i>

<i>The entire nation</i>
<i>has shut down for the day</i>

<i>as every Brazilian</i>
<i>from every walk of life</i>

<i>comes together to watch</i>
<i>the big game.</i>

[Whistle blows]

<i>And there's</i>
<i>the starting whistle.</i>

<i>It's Zagallo to Vava,</i>
<i>Vava to the young Nascimento</i>

<i>back to Nilton Santos,</i>
<i>and Parling lays into him.</i>

<i>Watch out! Oh my.</i>
<i>No card there.</i>

<i>So either the referee</i>
<i>missed that one</i>

<i>or he's going to let</i>
<i>Parling play rough.</i>

<i>Garrincha looking</i>
<i>for Nascimento</i>

<i>but he's marked</i>
<i>by three yellow shirts.</i>

<i>Garrincha passes to Zito.</i>

<i>Stolen away by Skoglund!</i>

<i>Sweden' first possession.</i>

<i>And now Raynor</i>
<i>calls for the shift!</i>

<i>Here we go, the Swedes</i>
<i>moving quickly down field.</i>

<i>Passing it down to Parling,</i>
<i>a quick touch over to Hamrin</i>

<i>Hamrin back to Liedholm and now</i>
<i>Hamrin breaks down the right wing.</i>

<i>Liedholm sends it to Parling,</i>
<i>Parling punches a swift pass</i>

<i>through Brazil's back bone</i>
<i>and into the area.</i>

<i>Simonsson down the middle,</i>
<i>Hamlin with a cross hitch.</i>

<i>Simonsson, just wide!</i>

<i>A brilliant attack</i>
<i>from the Nordic Titans!</i>

<i>And Sweden's applying</i>
<i>pressure early on.</i>

<i>Gilmar will take</i>
<i>the goal kick.</i>

<i>Trapped by Nascimento and now</i>
<i>finally with an opportunity.</i>

<i>And here he goes,</i>
<i>spinning his way</i>

<i>through Liedholm and Axbom.</i>

Now's the time, <i>meu filho.</i>

<i>And Pele is back</i>
<i>the other way.</i>

<i>Nascimento trying</i>
<i>to do it all on his own!</i>

<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

<i>A huge jolt from Parling.</i>

<i>Sweden removing Pele from
the equation just as promised.</i>

<i>They are determined</i>
<i>to stop his one-man show.</i>

<i>And Pele still down holding on that</i>
<i>right knee he recently injured.</i>

<i>Brazil down a man and Sweden looking to capitalize!</i>

<i>Kurt Hamrin plays the ball</i>
<i>up field to Liedholm</i>

<i>Liedholm straight to Lofgren.</i>

<i>Now he's alone in the area.</i>

<i>Goal! Sweden!</i>

<i>Liedholm! Less than 4 minutes</i>
<i>on the clock.</i>

<i>And this is big!</i>

[All moaning]

<i>Everyone expected Sweden</i>
<i>to come out early</i>

<i>but no one expected it</i>
<i>this early.</i>

<i>Confidence, our clear weak</i>
<i>point ever since 1950.</i>

<i>And it's hard not to think</i>
<i>of that tragic loss now.</i>

<i>The fans remembering</i>
<i>Coach Raynor's prediction</i>

<i>that an early score</i>
<i>would seal the victory.</i>

<i>The King, the Queen,</i>
<i>George Raynor and Team Sweden</i>

<i>they all want</i>
<i>the Jules Rimet trophy</i>

<i>to stay on friendly shores.</i>

<i>And stay it will</i>
<i>from the looks of things</i>

<i>as the victory celebrations</i>
<i>begin here in Rasunda Stadium</i>

<i>even the eleven Brazilians</i>
<i>on the field can't deny the --</i>

[instrumental music]

[whistle blows]

[upbeat music]

[indistinct commentary]

[music continues]

[all cheering]

[ecstatic yelling]

Pele!

[All cheering]

<i>Nascimento threw Sweden's</i>
<i>iron defense</i>

<i>off their marks freeing up</i>
<i>the lad's teammates</i>

<i>and Brazil evens the score.</i>

<i>A most unexpected turn.</i>

<i>And this is a Team Brazil like</i>
<i>we've never seen them before.</i>

<i>Just exuding confidence.</i>

[Crowd cheering]

[whistle blows]

<i>It's Liedholm to Gren,</i>
<i>back to Gustavsson</i>

<i>and now over to Hamlin.</i>

<i>Hamlin pushing it</i>
<i>forward to Simonsson.</i>

<i>And now Raynor sends his</i>
<i>defense forward in a full attack!</i>

<i>It's Bergmark forward</i>
<i>to Liedholm marked by Orlando.</i>

<i>He passes to Simonsson.</i>

<i>Simonsson back to Liedholm</i>

<i>and now it's Gustavsson again.</i>

<i>He sends it into the area</i>
<i>looking for Simonsson.</i>

<i>It's Gilmar coming</i>
<i>out of the goal.</i>

<i>Gren crosses.</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

<i>Vava!</i>

<i>Vava now marked by Axbom,</i>
<i>Borjesson comes in</i>

<i>for the stop but now Vava</i>
<i>dishes it</i> out to Garrincha.

<i>Bergmark's there, Garrincha fakes,</i>
<i>leaves the flank planted.</i>

<i>Garrincha now all alone!</i>

Svennson comes out to challenge.

<i>The cross.</i>
<i>It's Vava!</i>

<i>Goal, 2 to 1!</i>

<i>Brazil has taken the lead.</i>

[All cheering]

<i>Sweden caught off guard twice.</i>

<i>The Nordic Titans fall behind.</i>

<i>Brazil, 2.</i>
<i>Sweden, 1.</i>

<i>And now,</i>
<i>the entire Rasunda Stadium in a state of shock.</i>

<i>Expect Sweden to move fast</i>
<i>and strong</i>

<i>after that slap in the face --</i>


<i>Stolen away by Garrincha!</i>

<i>Brazil regains control!</i>
<i>Garrincha dishes to Vava.</i>

<i>Vava fakes Gren,</i>
<i>shakes off Bergmark</i>

<i>a beautiful,</i>
<i>blind dish to Didi.</i>

<i>Brazil working</i>
<i>in perfect harmony.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>something is shifting.</i>

<i>Brazil is coming alive!</i>

[Instrumental music]

[music continues]

<i>Now in complete control!</i>

<i>And it appears</i>
<i>they're smiling!</i>

[Indistinct commentaries]

Finally the world can see
Brazil's beauty!

Our heroes
now in perfect harmony!

<i>It's beyond football.</i>
<i>It's the most beautiful game!</i>

[Instrumental music]

[indistinct commentary on TV]

[music continues]

[crowd cheering]

[all cheering]

<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>
<i>the unthinkable!</i>

<i>Brazil, 3.</i>
<i>Sweden, 1.</i>

<i>The fans here in Sweden,</i>
<i>indeed, all of Europe</i>

<i>even the King and Queen now</i>
<i>applauding the South Americans.</i>

<i>George Raynor's strategy</i>
<i>no match for Brazil!</i>

[Indistinct commentary]

<i>And here comes Brazil!</i>

<i>Nascimento fakes Hamrin</i>

<i>Bergmark coming in</i>
<i>for support.</i>

<i>Now Nascimento</i>
<i>sends the cross.</i>

<i>Pele sends a long cross</i>
<i>to the left wing.</i>

<i>It's Zagallo,</i>
<i>from the corner of the box.</i>

<i>Svennson dives.</i>

<i>Goal!</i>

[All cheering]

[instrumental music]


<i>Only seconds now</i>
<i>left on the clock</i>

<i>and it's Didi with</i>
<i>a cross to Nascimento --</i>

[all cheering]

<i>Brazil wins</i>
<i>the 1958 World Cup!</i>

[Upbeat music]


[yelling in joy]


[all cheering]

[horn honking]

[ecstatic yell]


[music continues]

[yelling in joy]

<i>June 29th, 1958</i>

<i>the day Brazil won</i>
<i>our first World Cup.</i>

<i>When the final whistle blew</i>

<i>I fainted</i>
<i>right there on the field.</i>

<i>When I finally opened my eyes</i>

<i>everything felt like a dream.</i>

<i>It had only been 18 months</i>
<i>since I first left home</i>

<i>but it felt like years.</i>

<i>My mother and father</i>
<i>came out to meet me.</i>

<i>And dad reminded me</i>
<i>of the promise I made</i>

<i>8 years earlier.</i>

<i>But I'll never forget 1958,</i>

<i>the year I became Pele.</i>

<i>Our ginga style became known</i>
<i>as The Beautiful Game.</i>

<i>And the Brazilians everywhere</i>
<i>came to see.</i>

<i>It was our differences</i>
<i>that made us beautiful.</i>
