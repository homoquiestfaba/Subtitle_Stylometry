That's a man.
It's me.

Uh, hold up.

Hey.

I promise you,

if these kids tear up
my house, I'm gonna-

You gonna what?

I'll promise you, D.

Keily does not know what to do

Ooh, but look at him.

Hey, baby.

<i>(Candace)</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, shh, shh.</i>

Both of you,

will you please stop flirting
with these college boys?

would be my question.

because they're young.

Number two,
you both have men.

Separated.

Divorcing.

<i>(Candace)</i>
<i>You haven't even filed yet.</i>

<i>And, oh, my God.</i>

Wow, I would
buy him an Xbox.

[Katherine laughs]

<i>(Dedra)</i>
<i>I might as well file.</i>

My husband has a different woman
in every city he plays in.

<i>(Candace)</i>
<i>That's hearsay.</i>

not to marry a pro athlete.

They're all whores.

I just thought baseball players
were different, you know?

But he's gonna slip up,

and when he do,
I'm gonna catch him.

to go pay this caterer.

I'll be right back.

<i>(Candace)</i>
<i>Ooh, and I'm going to go see</i>

Oh, thanks.

Looks like

I thought you were
one of the college kids.

Huh?

Yeah, you know, it's so loud in here,
I can barely hear you.

I'm sorry.

This is for you.

Okay.

Okay.

Well, thank you,
and I hope you enjoy your food.

And thank you
for your business.

Wait a minute.

Seem like you the only one
that's trippin'.

I don't care.
You're not getting in here with us.

Oh, it's like that?

What are you,
stupid or something?

Wait a minute, shorty.

You ain't even seen
what I got to offer yet.

Let me show you...

what's really going on.


What, I miss the joke
or something?

What happened?

<i>Is my thing out? What's happening?</i>
Rubber duckies?

Quack.

You know his mama
picked them out for him.

You ain't gotta
like my rubber duckies.

<i>(girl)</i>
<i>Quack, quack.</i>

Forget y'all!

Excuse me.

Could you get me
that towel over there, please?

There you go.

Thank you.

Sure. No problem.

Hey, I'm Trey.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Honey, we have a problem?

No, there is no problem.

Is your name Honey?

just giving me a towel, okay?

I'm right over here.

Look, you can't be
talking to dudes-

always embarrassing me.

<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>I'm embarrassing you?</i>

I'm so sorry about this.

That's okay.

apologizing to him?

He's the help.

Stop being rude, Carlton.

You are always
doing this.


Trey, is it?

Yeah, Trey it is.

Do me a favor.

Why don't you get me and my girl
a plate of ribs, some chicken-

Carlton.

He brought them.

He's the rib dude.

He's supposed to serve it too,
ain't he?

Hey, yo, Trey,
no potato salad for me, man.

Bad on the indigestion.

What?
What did I say?

<i>(girl #1)</i>
<i>I'm gonna tell your mama.</i>

[girls laughing]

<i>(girl #2)</i>
<i>I know. Did you see those?</i>

<i>His mommy pick them out</i>
<i>for him this morning.</i>

<i>(girl #1)</i>
<i>Gotta love your mama.</i>

[girls laughing]

<i>(girl #2)</i>
<i>I thought he was about to dive in.</i>

[girls chatting and laughing]

works at that ghetto spot

where they got, like,
eight businesses in one.

So?

That gives you no right
to be rude.

<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>I think it does.</i>

Excuse me.

Here's my
business card/menu.

Oops.


Hey, Trey,
we got to go, man.

We got a problem.

What is you doing?

<i>(Vince)</i>
<i>Man, come on!</i>

All right.

Oh!

[water splashing]

That's right.

You better run.

It's your ass
when I see you next time!

[upbeat R&B music]

[Tamia singing] What
happened to the roses

and the little phone calls
we made throughout the day?

And the silly little games
we played?

Somehow things have changed

How I miss the old.

Got my feelings thrown.

We barely holding on

Why can't we,
you and me, be happy?

Why can't we
just be so happy?

Why can't we just chill
and be happy?

Why can't we
just be so happy?

The arguing
seems to win over lovin'.

Use to be huggin',

kissin', and rubbin'.

Now every day
is something new

separating me and you.

I thought that we could
get through anything.

Why can't we,
you and me, be happy?

Why can't we
just be so happy?

So happy, baby.

Why can't we
just chill and be happy?

Why can't we just
be so happy?

<i>(Mr. Vickers)</i>
<i>Glad you enjoyed it.</i>

Vince, put the magazine down.
Get to work.

You don't stand a chance
with none of them shorts.

It's shorties, Dad.

<i>(Mr. Vickers)</i>
<i>Shorties? Got you.</i>

(Mrs. Vickers) I thought you had
a buyer for that spear, Cinque?

crackers came in yesterday.

Said they'd come back
this morning and buy one.

Never showed up.

You know how
white folks are.

(Mrs. Vickers)
Yes, I do.

<i>Don't sweat it, Cin.</i>

Yeah.

All I'm saying is,
the peckerwood could've told me

he wasn't interested
instead of wasting my time.

(Mrs. Vickers)
Let it go, Cin.

You know they got
that elitist attitude.

think they better than us.

(Mrs. Vickers)
Exactly.

Unbelievable.

Well, hello.

What can you do for me?

What?

I mean, uh...

what can I do for you?

(No Doubt)
I will get your dog.

[record scratching]

Your dog.

Get your dog.

Krispy Kreme.

The pumping of the bass.

The color
of your hair, dude.

Hey.

<i>That's it for today, boys.</i>

<i>What's up, Trey?</i>

(K-3)
<i>Yeah, fo' sho, fo' sho.</i>

Hey, look here,
Mack, man.

About that money

So, you know,

<i>(Mack)</i>
<i>Yeah, man, that's cool.</i>

<i>That's all right.</i>

Yeah.

Yeah, just hit me

<i>No.</i>


The developers again?

Yeah.

All right, they gonna run you
straight out of business.

That's why you haven't been able
to upgrade the studio now.

of these kids have talent.

<i>They just</i>
<i>ain't got the money.</i>

It's just my way
of helping out.

<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

That's a reel to reel
right there.

That's a cassette recorder.

Everything nowadays
is digital.

Once people figure out how
to do this on their laptops,

<i>you gonna be done.</i>

owe you for the food?

Why you tuning me out?

Why don't you
just sell this place, man,

and cash out?

our blood, sweat, and tears

<i>into this place.</i>

You see all these stars
on this wall here?

They all
did their albums here.

<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

They not coming back.

You got a 16-track board
and only 9 of the tracks work.

They not coming back.

I'm not selling.

If your father was here-

He would
tell you to sell.

<i>No, he wouldn't.</i>

in arrears, all right?

<i>I saw the notice.</i>

through my mail now?

I'm not looking at your mail, all right?

You got 35 days left

until they
foreclose on this property.

All right, and you're
not getting nothing for it.

tear this place down

and turn it
into a strip mall, man.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

Oh, you ain't got no choice.

You ain't got no money.

I'll get the money.

From where?

angry all the time?

You want to know why?

Because the conservative
white right wing of America

is trying to take us
back to the '50s.

And I'm not going.

(Mrs. Vickers)
Word.

Oh, hell no.

Ma, why do you
always keep feeding

into his hostile attitude?

(Mrs. Vickers) Well, I'll stop when
you quit running up my credit cards

on those
meet-a-freak websites.


That's real funny.

Yeah, you know
I'm doing a research project.

(Mrs. Vickers)
Okay.

In what class?

<i>Don't you have to be</i>
<i>enrolled in college</i>

to take classes?

always trying to put me on glass?

<i>(Trey) Look, man, you
know you're an easy target.</i>

You still looking at them girls
on the internet, huh?

<i>(Vince)</i>
<i>Aw, man. Come on, man.</i>

<i>You trippin', man.</i>

You know
I got the ladies.

Damn.

<i>Hey, Ma, I got this one.</i>

How y'all doing?

Come on.

Thanks, Vin.

Hey, man, hey,

<i>middle linebacker, man,</i>
<i>from NCU.</i>

He about 6'5", 250.

Now, you know
I'm half of that.

You know what I'm saying?

And you know
I'm into the self-preservation.

<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>Shut up, punk!</i>

what's up with your boy?

So it was you.

If I remember correctly,

I said the next time I saw you,
I was going to whoop your ass.

And I believe
this is next time.

obvious that philosophy

must be one
of your favorite subjects.

[Carlton scoffs]

Hey!

Hey, Trey,

What you gonna do?

You better get off me, homes.

Or else what?

What you
gonna do about it?

Oh!

Ah, that hurts, man.

What's wrong with you?

Let my arm go.

Yeah. Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

Get off me.

no need to apologize.

I mean,
you're absolutely stunning.

(Mrs. Vickers) Vince, your dad
and I are fixing to roll out.

Can you hold it down
for about three hours?

Of course.

(Mrs. Vickers) Okay,
come on, honey, let's go.

[Keily whispers]
Those are his parents?

Yeah, he adopted.

Wow.

That's no way for a man

You know you can
do better than that.

<i>I gotta go.</i>

Bye.

Bye.

Why you do that, man?

What was her name?

Uh, uh, uh, Bab-

Bambi.

She got you for $300.

I'm stupid or something?

You don't think I know an
internet scam when I see one?

I'm appalled at you.

Look, you're supposed
to be my boy?

I'm going to go ball.

And it wasn't $300.

It was $375.

It's just that with the tax,
it was $300.

[man rapping]
You see me

I got my head on TV
but you don't see

Haters looking mad
'cause my swag, like, ill.

A little possessive, but...

Tell me about it.

The boy does love you.

No, it's too much rabbit.


[Trey whispering]
Okay, okay, okay.

Hey.

Hey, what's up?

Oh, hey. How are you?

<i>The red, the red, the red.</i>

Hello?

I really couldn't hear you.

I'm not playing.

I'm not talking

I'm in a store with Sida.

A clothing store.

The one that
I always go to, yes.

You hang up first.

If I hang up,
you'll get mad at me, okay?

<i>I'm going</i>

Love you too.

Wow.

How many phones

A little?

He just loves me a lot

If it works for you.

Well, look, I'd like
to hook up with you sometime.

Did you not hear her?

She said
she has a boyfriend.

Sida.

<i>That's rude.</i>

She's right.

I have a boyfriend,

and that just
wouldn't be appropriate.

<i>I just thought we could</i>
<i>be friends or something.</i>

<i>Look.</i>

Here's my number again.

No strings attached.

If you ever want
to talk to me,

just call me

<i>Snap out of it, okay?</i>

He is not

but he is at least
a step up from him.

Goodness gracious.

[knocking at door]

Hello?

Southside Barbecue.

The door's open.

Come on in.

I just came
out of the shower.

Oh, okay.

Place looks familiar.

Been here before.

This is real nice.

I like this.

Hey.

Hey.

I know you.

just looking around

and said I delivered
food here for you before.

Yeah, it's not every day

that I get a cute young man
to deliver my food for me.

Me?

Yeah.

Have a seat.

I got your money
right over here.

All right.

Oh, sh-

This is a mess.

Oh.

Um, you didn't see that,
did you?

No, not all of it.

I'm so embarrassed.

Don't be, ma'am.

I mean,
you have a nice body.

Please don't call me ma'am.

It makes me feel old.

Just call me Kat.

Kat, you have a nice body.

Kat, right?

Mm-hmm.

What are you thinking?

A lot of things.

Like?

Like, I don't know.

you want to know about me?

Well, I know, every year,

you let the AKKs
throw a party at your house.

That's about it.

Okay, well,

I'm sure that's not
the only thing you're thinking,

so let me just let you know
that I don't make it a habit

to sleep with men
five or six years my junior

who deliver ribs
to my house.

And, yes,
I'm married.

But I'm separated,
and it's going on two years now.

And, yes,
you were incredible.

Are you serious?

Yeah.

Do you have a girlfriend?


"no" answer that follows that question.

Well, not at the moment.

She kind of occupied
at the present time, you know,

so no.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

keep this between us?

I mean, you kind of caught me
at a weak moment.

Come on, girl.

You got my word.

I won't tell a soul.

[record scratching]

All she had
was just a robe on, man.

Next thing you know,

I'm trying to walk
all through it.

You lying.

What you mean, lying?

I don't believe that.

She got naked like that?

She got a big booty?

I didn't know what to do with it.

I was looking everywhere,
you know what I'm saying?

Let me tell you-
let me tell you something.

Hey, you know
how I like booty.

You already know.

She made me work out more.

That's why
I'm working out right now.

can't keep ignoring

the notices we sent you.

<i>(Mack) Look, I told you last
week that I was going to try</i>

to apply
for a second mortgage.

<i>(man)</i>
<i>You couldn't even get the loan</i>

for a Hot Wheels.

ain't going to come in here

and talk to my uncle
like a little kid.

I can handle this.

Back up.

Take the offer, man.

I am not going to foreclose.

I'm going to get you
that $75,000.

<i>(man)</i>
<i>Talk to your uncle.</i>

Get up out of here, man.

(K-3)
Listen to this.

Three, two, wick-a-wick, one.

(No Doubt) Flip-a-tick,
talk the talk

like a clock
with a hole in my sock.

I could kiss a gnat
strapped with my gat.

I hit you with the word, y'all.

Like a ninja turtle,

I talks with the po-po.

And I flow
on the low-low.

(K-3) Can you see where
he's going with that?

I mean,
can you see it?

You see that?

It's fire right there.

He's hot.

Nobody's
talking like that.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

Hey, what's up, V?

Hey, what's up?

Hey, where your dad at?

back in the kitchen.

You okay?

It's nothing.

Uh.

What the...

See, Vick?

This is the part of the pig
that whitey will let us eat.

Know what I'm saying?

And we turn it
into a delicacy,

'cause we creative,
you know what I'm saying?

<i>(Mr. Vickers) I don't
understand why that was done.</i>

I am so deeply troubled.

I am so ashamed.

To do that to another
human being, that's wrong.

I'm sorry, man.

It just really hurts me
to think about it.

It's all right, Vick.

It's just a small microcosm
of what they did to break us down.

(Mr. Vickers) But why would
they do that to people?

people is wrong, Vick.

(Mr. Vickers) Yeah, but why
would they do that to everybody?

<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

I didn't mean
to interrupt,

but I need to talk to you,
Mr. Vickers.

(Mr. Vickers)
We'll continue this later.

Yeah, you all right, Vick?

I'll holler at you.

I'm gonna be
right over here.

(Mr. Vickers)
What's up?

Well, I've been working here
for almost two years now, sir.

And I need
some more money, so...

(Mr. Vickers)
Oh, Trey...

(Mr. Vickers)
I wish I could.

We're on a very strict budget here.

I just bought
a bunch of radio time.

We're pinching pennies.

overtime, whatever it takes.

(Mr. Vickers) Trey, I cannot
afford to pay you overtime.

Son, you know
how hard it is

to run a black business
in this town?

And white people are not exactly
busting my door down

for the ribs
and the African artifacts.

It's just not making it,
all right?

I hope you understand that.

<i>Do you?</i>

Yes, sir.

I understand.

Mm, mm, mm.

I just love it
when you come here.

You can wash clothes for free
any time you want.

You hear me?

<i>Hey, hey.</i>

<i>What's up, dog?</i>
<i>Where you going?</i>

[Vince laughing]

I could've told you

She gave me $1,000.

turned you into a trick.

No, that makes me the pimp.

No, she would be the pimp.


So that makes you the ho.

No.
Yes.

Whatever, man.

She gave me a grand,
all right?

What you saying?

It's all right.

I'm just hating anyhow,
but it's cool, though,

because when Bunni gets here,
the script is gonna be flipped.


for you, man, for real, man.

Oh, no, no, no.

I'm happy.

Let me show you
what I'm doing to this room.

Let me show you
how I sexed this room up.

Check this out.

[smooth R&B music playing]


[clears throat]

That was, uh-
That was pretty cool, huh?

[humming uncomfortably]

the white spots on everything?

Hm?

on the real, man,

I got to jet.

I'm going to holler at you,
all right?

You ain't got to do all that.

I love you, man.

You need a sock
or something.

Damn!

[brakes squeak]

Oh, great.

It's the pest.

say I'm the best,

but I'm pretty close to it.

How you doing, Keily?


I'm doing great.

Think I could talk to you
for a minute?

Keily, we got to go.

I got a minute.

Oh, you do?

All right.

Um, so where's the man?

He's at football practice.

Kind of figured that.

None of your cell phones
are ringing.

Funny.

me, out of three phones,

you couldn't
give me a call?

<i>(Keily) Trey, I have been with
Carlton for over six years.</i>

And I care for him deeply,
okay?

Aha.

What?

said you loved him.

I do love him.

Are you in love with him?

think you're asking

some awful personal
questions here?

I got to go.

Wait, Keily.

Look, just give me
one chance, all right?

Can we just
meet up once?

Have sodas
or something?

Seriously?

You know,
Carlton would have a fit

if I did something
like that.

He don't have to know.

I just can't.

Keily.

Just once, all right?

<i>I promise</i>
<i>I won't bug you anymore.</i>

What exactly
do you want from me?

Well, I don't know.

Just think about it,
all right?

I'll think about it.

I got to go.

Are you crazy?

You know Carlton has spies
all over this place.

Sida, stop trippin'.

see in him anyway?

He delivers ribs.

Oh, now,
there's a bright future.

(No Doubt) Hot water,
corn bread, I said.

Got popped by the feds.

Now I'm seeing red.

I peed in my bed.

I must be dead.

Flip-a-tick,
talk the talk

like a clock
with a hole in my sock.

(K-3)
We 'bout to get so paid.

<i>(No Doubt)</i>
<i>I hit you with the word, y'all.</i>

<i>Like a ninja turtle.</i>

<i>I talk with the po-po,</i>

<i>but I flow</i>
<i>on the low-low.</i>

gonna be honest with them?

Trey, I build dreams.

I don't tear them down.

three weeks left to get 75K.


<i>(No Doubt)</i>
<i>All right, from the top, baby.</i>

<i>I'm coming in.</i>

(K-3) Let's do this
bonfires right now.

(No Doubt)
Yo, dog.

Yeah.

[Mack chuckles]

Here, have this.

What's this?

Hey.

<i>Hey, I can't take this.</i>

Man, this is your savings.

that more than I do.

Plus, I owe you.

You my nephew, man.

You don't owe me nothing.

Look, Unc,

you didn't have to take me
when my dad died, all right?

But you did.

And I'm grateful
to have you in my life.

Plus, I know how important it was
for you and my dad

to keep this studio
up and running.

This studio's more than just
a place to make music.

It's a diversion
for the youth in the community.

Look, I see the big picture,
all right?

So take that.

I know it's not much.

I'm going to come up
with something.

Trey.

<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

I love you, man.

I love you too, Unc.

Gosh, it's really slow today.

Yeah.

But anyway,
like I was saying, right?

<i>The white woman puts the change</i>
<i>on the counter</i>

instead of in my hand.

Know what I'm saying?

So I say to her politely-

I wasn't rude.

I said to her politely,

I said, "That's not how
I gave you my money.

I placed my money
in your hand."

(Mrs. Vickers)
Oh, what a bitch.

<i>(Cinque)</i>
<i>That's herway...</i>

of making me feel
like I'm not human.

You got
to understand something.

White people don't see us
as equal,

which, in turn, makes us feel
unwanted in this society.

(Mr. Vickers)
No, you are wanted.

And you are accepted.

<i>And why do white people</i>

treat people with such disdain?

What's up, everybody?

<i>(Vince)</i>
<i>Hey, what's up, boy?</i>

What's-

Nah. Cool.
What's up?

Why you crying, Mr. Vickers?

stay away from my girl.

Hey, man.

Stop it before I break it.

All right, all right, all right.

had to remove you from the premises.

<i>Get out.</i>

<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

You been warned, Trey.

Stay your ass
away from Keily.

don't know your girl,

but I'm going
to sit down with Trey,

and we gonna
come up with something

where we can work it out.

Shut your ass up!

is wrong with him?

You hitting her?

[mouthing words]

Oh, thank you so much.

I mean, look,
I'm not in love.

It's just...

this young man
is just so passionate.

<i>(Dedra)</i>
<i>To get passion,</i>

much is required.

I call it the three C's.

<i>Comfortability,</i>

consistency-

And "C" Batteries.


And commitment.

<i>(Katherine)</i>
<i>Look, you guys,</i>

it's not even that serious.

I mean, it just feels so good
to feel wanted again.

<i>You know what I mean?</i>

Being wanted
and feeling wanted just,

it makes you
want to be wanted

<i>while wanting</i>
<i>to want something.</i>

You know what I'm saying?

No.

I like them young too.

That way, you can mold them

into whatever you want them
to be, like Play-Doh.

I just hope that my sorers
can keep my business to themselves.

Why are y'all
looking at me?

I do not have
a big mouth.

I didn't tell about you
getting caught stealing.

I didn't tell her
about that.

<i>(Dedra) Okay, why you got to</i>
<i>bring that up in front of her?</i>

(K-3)
Try and be late this time.

[buzzer sounds]

Come on, man.

[buzzer sounds]

(K-3)
Come on.

Yo, who is it?

(K-3)
Yo, it's K-3 and-

No Doubt.

(K-3)
Yeah, how'd you know?

Man, what you guys want, man?

(K-3) Yo, I got some
fire for you, man.


y'all talking about,
y'all got some fire for me.

And y'all
haven't delivered nothing

even remotely close to that.

Matter of fact-

Y'all, hold on right quick.

Yo, it's 97.3,
hip-hop and R&B.

Listen, I got these fools
outside of my door right now

that are trying to get me
to listen to their demo.

(No Doubt) Hey, man, he

(K-3)
Yeah, shh.

Yo, and if you think
I'm going to let them in,

you're absolutely crazy.

What I'm gonna do is,

I'm going to put this microphone
up to the intercom,

and we gonna see what fire
these dudes have been talking about.

K-3, can you hear me?

(K-3)
Yes, I can.

No Doubt,

(No Doubt)
Yes, sir.

Matter of fact, go ahead
and play a sample of that fire.

(No Doubt) Oh, okay. Okay.

[hip-hop music playing]

[both singing] Do you know
where we going with this?

Do you know
where we going with this?

Do you know
where we going with this?

Do you know
where we going with this?

Now, that was some booty.

(K-3)
Man, are you kidding me, man?

That was ill, man.

Yeah, I think
I am getting sick.

<i>[laughs]</i>

(No Doubt)
Hold up, man.

You ain't even
give us a chance, dog.

You making us play our song
through the intercom, homes.

Hey, man, this thing needs to be
live on the air, man.

They can't even
hear the beat.

I'll tell you what.

Here's what
I'm gonna do right now.

I'm in a nice mood.

I'm gonna take some calls,

and I'm gonna find out
what the people think.

97.3, what up?

What do you think of that new
K-3/No Doubt record?

<i>(man) Son, on the real,
son, that song, son...</i>

<i>that song is hot, son.</i>

Really?

<i>(man)</i>
<i>Keep playing that song, son.</i>

Huh.

Hey, thanks for the call.

Hey, K-3,
your cousin just called.

Let's take another call.

What you think?

<i>(woman) You are crazy</i>
<i>if you don't like that song.</i>

<i>That song was hot.</i>

<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>where I can get it?</i>

<i>Is it out yet?</i>

You can't be serious.

(No Doubt)
Yeah, boy!

Hey!

Hey, you heard 'em?

(K-3)
Yo, they feelin' it, man.

They feelin' it.

(No Doubt) Hey, man,
we got a hit, dog.

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Yo, you gotta let them in.</i>

<i>I want to hear</i>
<i>the whole song.</i>

(No Doubt) Hey, man, open
this mother[...] door.

[hip-hop music playing]

[K-3 and No Doubt singing]
Do you know where we going with this?

Do you know
where we going with this?

Do you know
where we going with this?

I had to punish him.

I just
can't have everybody

trying to come
and get with my woman.

<i>(Keily)</i>
<i>You don't own me.</i>

<i>All you do is just treat me</i>
<i>like I'm a piece of property.</i>

<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>I told you, I don't like that dude.</i>

And what do you do?

You publicly humiliate me
by talking to him in public.

<i>Just what were you thinking?</i>

gonna get out this car

if y'all
about to start trippin'.

Peace.

in the house, Keily.

to check with you first

before I speak to someone?

have to hear it in the streets first?

That's probably, what,

the second time
I've even spoken to him.

Why are you
so threatened by him?

Please, threatened?

Girl, he's a delivery boy.

He's beneath me
and you.

arrogant thing to say.

Hey.

What's up, girl?


Arguing, as always.

won't break up with that fool.

Big, old country bumpkin.

Girl, he don't know
who I am.

Well, you know what?

That makes two of us.

done talking to you.

Can I go?

Look, I'm sorry, okay?

It's just that
I love you more than anything.

I can't stand the thought
of another man looking at you,

let alone talking to you.

Carlton, can I go?


Keily?

I accept your apology.

Can I go?

What's wrong with y'all?

Nothing's wrong.

What are you all doing?

your uncle's SIM card

from his cell phone.

SIM card out his cell phone?

You know that's fowl, right?

it's my SIM card,

'cause I bought it
and put it in his phone.

His dumb ass don't even know
what a SIM card is.

did you pull that off?

to see him play in DC.

And then after I put it on him,
he fell asleep,

and I switched
the SIM cards.

So let's see what's new
in Jason's life.

Oh, now, this one right here
looks nothing like me.

Nice boob job, though.

She has a natural
little teardrop shape to it.

It looks good.

Ugh.

Look at her.

She needs a wax.

or a weed whacker, something.

Ew, that's nasty.

[all laughing]

[all sigh]

Y'all are crazy.

I know this one.

I believe he told me
it was his cousin from L.A.

Well, let's just see who that is
near her mouth, shall we?

Let's zoom in.

Bingo.

I'd recognize
those genitals anywhere.

You see that mole
shaped like a cockroach?

Unfortunately.

Yeah, yeah.

That's your uncle's
scrotum sac, baby, mm-hmm.

And you see
that angle?

He must've
taken that one himself.

definitely a POV shot.

Mm-hmm.

Definitely.

I think you've had enough.

You're getting
a little upset here,

so why don't we
just close it?


Dedra is fine.

Dedra is not upset, okay?

I am fine.

I am just getting started.

I am not upset.

Oh, okay, now,
this one is upsetting.

Why?

'Cause that's a girl-rilla.

Oh, I can't believe
I slept after that.

Oh, my God,
call the clinic.

Trey.

Hey, Trey.


This order been sitting out here
for about 25 minutes.

Come on, son.

Where is it?

Right there.

Where's it going?

North side.

I can't see that
without my glasses.

There you go.

North side,
506 Castle.

Oh, my God.

Uh!

Walk in blackness,
my brother.

Power to the people.

[speaks foreign language]

Stay strong,
black man.

K-3 and No Doubt.

You knew?

Yeah, I knew.

I just mixed that song

They've been playing it

They must've went down
to the radio station or something.

<i>(Mack)</i>
<i>No, I'm happy for them.</i>

<i>You know, people giving them</i>

Hello?

Trey?

Who is it?

Okay, I'll call you back.

<i>(Keily)</i>
<i>All right, bye-bye.</i>

Bye.

Uh...

It was an important call.

It was a girl's voice.

Look, nobody lying to you.

I told you I had to take
