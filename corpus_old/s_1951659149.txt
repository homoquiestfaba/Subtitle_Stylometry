he takes care of me.
y ou have nothing to worry about.

yo, see y'all later.

feed those guys.

talk to me.

anything l have is yours.

my house is yours,
my bitch is yours...

...but not my wife.

y ou showed me the game.

y ou know the fellas have to eat.

lf they don't, they'll turn around
and eat our food.

l don't know jamaica like that.

and l don't know these cats like that.

see what l'm saying?

lt's been 20 years since l've been back
to this motherfucker, yo.

l'm out of my comfort zone.

jamaica is a cakewalk.
l saw you lock down miami.

what happened to you?
fuck jamaica.

we have the manpower...

...and the guns too.

l had millions of dollars
in america...

...before l went to prison.

l lived the best life
there was to live...

...and l want it back.

and little jamaica
can't do that for me.

y ou don't understand.

did you see all those houses
we drove past on the way up here?

all the people, shops and stores...

...they give me a little something
to live comfortably.

a little something, huh?

protection.

y ou know, we're more effective
than the police.

-sounds like extortion.
-so you call it.

nigga, that's what it is.
what the fuck you talking about?

l call it capitalism.

around here,
they understand the program.

they kicked us out of america.

this is where we are now.

what are we gonna do,
lay down...

...so people can call us
worthless deportee boys?

l don't even like that word,
''deportee.''

lf a motherfucker calls me a deportee,
l'll empty my gun in his fucking face.

y eah. definitely.

lt's been four years
since l got deported.

l came back home just like you,
with nothing.

but l realized l had to
step up the game.

y eah. for real.

take america out of your mind.

right now, we have
everything here in jamaica.

even politicians are in our pockets.

hello, baby.

hello.

let me talk to the big man.

-like your hair.
-hello, mr. chin?

okay, sir. there's some men
at the front.

-he'll be with you. he's coming, okay?
-all right.

what's up, mr. chin?
are you ready for me?

l told you, man, one more week.

me no have it yet.

come back and see me.

y ou think l have time to waste?

-trying to beat the system, mr. chin?
-no, not at all.

but you and l have an agreement.

y eah, and you're not keeping
your end of the bargain.

so, max, do him.

ls this how y'all living?

man, fuck the chinese boy.

he hasn't paid for three months.

what does he think this is, a game?

no, motherfucker.
this is the real thing.

y o, l'm just saying though,
what the fuck was that?

where you from?

miami.

where in miami are you from?

y ou ask too many questions.

he's the big man. he runs miami.

just take care of him.

l'll be back. l'm going to the bathroom.
order more champagne.

faggot, remember me?

remember you from where?
l don't know you.

shoot the motherfucker.

-die. y ou're gonna die.
-shoot the motherfucker.

-get off the bike!
-police!

motherfuckers must die!

big move.

big move for who?

checkmate in two more turns.

-hello.
-a full four more.

how you learn to play this game?

say what?

not a talking game,
it's a killing game.

who called?

mad max.

he said....

he said they just killed blacka.

who just killed my little brother?

he said laing and his friends.

that police boy, laing, he must die!

hello.

let me speak to mr. anderson.

mr. anderson,
wayne is on the phone for you.

wayne, what's happening?
how is everything?

not so good, sir.

what happened now, wayne?

y our boys getting out of control?

the only person
out of control is laing.

laing is an officer of the law.

and if your boys won't listen,
there is very little l can do.

but he knew that was my little brother.
he didn't have to kill him.

the chinese businesspeople knew
blacka and mad max were behind...

-...their colleague's murder.
-they didn't have to kill him.

when things get like that,
it's out of my hands.

wayne...

...you need to come to my office
and see me.

blacka threw his life away.

blacka knew what was going on.

he should have been
right here with us.

too much showing off, dog.

l hear you, biggs.

but laing has wanted to kill someone
in my crew for a long time.

he never liked me!

gangster, don't you see
that's natural...

...police and thieves.

the politician, mr. anderson,
wants me to come see him.

let me tell you something.

police, politicians...

...l don't trust any of them!

remember that.

l'm still gonna listen
to what he has to say.

mr. anderson, mr. anderson.

wayne.

how you doing, friend?

have a seat, gentlemen.

mr. andy, this is my friend biggs.

y ou already know john john.

so, what can l do
to cool things down?

l don't want you and officer laing
going at it, you know.

lt's him. he needs to chill.

he needs to back off.

he knew blacka was my little brother.
he didn't have to kill him.

listen to yourself.

l'm really sorry about your brother...

...but he was like a mad dog
running wild.

mr. andy, that was my little brother.

furthermore, laing wants
to stop our livelihood...

...and that's not gonna happen.

wayne, election is coming up...

...and l cannot afford to have
any unnecessary wrongs...

...in my constituency.

y ou're going to have to
work with me, wayne.

so, what do you want me
to do for you now, sir?

as you know, l have a very good
connection at the embassy.

l need you to leave jamaica.

l'll get you and your friends
the visa.

and you leave the island
and go cool out for a while.

because l can't take the heat
that is about to come down on me.

l have a whole community
depending on me.

mr. andy, l respect you,
but l'm not leaving jamaica.

things are good for me
right now in jamaica.

wayne...

...there is nothing else on the table.

nothing else on the table?

y ou're telling me that
you can't tell laing to back off?

y ou can't tell him to step aside?

wayne, don't put me in a spot.

mr. andy, l feel like
you're not trying to hear me.

y ou're not trying to
see things my way.

furthermore, l feel like
you're disrespecting me.

so you know what?
we're leaving.

wayne.

wayne.

wayne.

detective laing...

...this is patrick anderson, mp.

not good.

detective...

...we both have a common problem.

his name is wayne.

y ou're familiar with him...

...you killed his brother.

and now it's his turn.

y ou can find him at waterhouse,
any time after dark.

and, detective...

...just make sure that this problem
is permanently eradicated.

police! police!

faggot-ass police!

get wayne, max! get wayne!

mr. laing! don't kill me!
l'm just a dj, mr. laing!

don't say my name out of
your fucking dead mouth.

lf it's war they want,
it's war they'll fucking get!

we're gonna show them
who the real gangsters are.

that's not going to benefit us,
wayne.

we have to leave this alone
or we're gonna end up dead!

miami is where we need to be...

...to start robbing some of those
bigtime drug dealers.

gangsters don't rob 9-to-5 people
and poor people. y ou know that.

america is where we need to be.
definitely.

y ou know what?

let me call that bitch-ass politician.

do that. let him get us the visas.
then, if necessary, we'll kill him.

-y eah.
-mr. anderson's office.

hello, good afternoon.
may i speak to mr. anderson, please?

may l ask who's calling?

tell him it's detective laing.

mr. andy, it's officer laing again.

seven wanted men were killed
by the police in a shootout.

detective laing.

l've been watching the news
all day...

...and none of those seven bodies is
identified as our friend wayne smith.

y ou really fucked up this time,
mr. anderson, you know that?

y ou fuck up this time!

wayne?

wayne.

wayne, you know that this is
a big misunderstanding.

we can talk, you know, friend.

we don't have a motherfucking
thing to talk about.

after you and your police friends
tried to kill me last night...

...they murdered
seven of my friends...

...seven men who killed
to put you in power!

now you wanna talk?

the only fucking things talking
will be our guns!

what about that visa thing
l told you about?

that deal still stands, you know.

y ou have 48 hours.

we want three american visas.

all the necessary information will be
faxed to your office within the hour.

l will personally
take care of it myself.

don't fuck with me, mr. anderson!

we already have people
at your kids' school...

...outside your house,
ready to fuck your wife...

...and outside your office too.

wayne, you got my word on it.

we're gonna work this out
for the better.

hello, wayne?

wayne?

so let her go now, wayne.

how do they look? legit?

that's for my little brother blacka,
