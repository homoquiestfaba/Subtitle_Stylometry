VALERIE: They think we're
strangers, Isaac.

Trust me.

(Birds chirping in background)

Hey.

Yo, why'd you fucking drag me
out here?

My knee's killin' me,
I'm having surgery on Monday.

What the fuck?

JIMMY: Why couldn't you just
do it like the rest of 'em?

Wh... what?
What the fuck does that mean?

You dope, you win.

I won, a lot, okay?

Clean.

I lost clean.

You see what happens
to these guys

when they get fuckin' busted?

I... I retired ages ago,
I don't get this.

Why... why... why now?

You were a sure thing, man.

Even if you lost,
I'd make it back the next time.

Only there wasn't
another next time

and I can't pay them anymore.

They're bleeding me, Rick.

Why didn't you tell me this
sooner?

After the injury,
things got different.

I didn't wanna lay
all my baggage onto you, so I...

RICK:
Who?

Who do you owe?

(Birds chirping in background)

The fuckin' steroid guys.

(Birds chirping in background)

Jesus fucking Christ.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Boo!
Shit.

Hey, man.
Ooh, wow!

I was startin' to think
you got lost.

I... I... you know,
I haven't been to the new place

very many times.

RICK:
Really?

I... I moved here right...
right after the injury.

ISAAC:
Oh, yeah.

Um, well, I might have been
to some of the parties

you threw when you uh,
started the team,

but I don't remember,
maybe I got a ride.

Probably got a ride
or somethin'.

ISAAC:
Fucked up.

Um, cheers.
ISAAC: Cheers.

Well, I'm thinking uh,
diggin' the...

You like that?


ISAAC: New, right?
I know.

You can barely see me, right?

Well, since uh, you made me
team captain and all that,

figured you'd wanna talk
about the season.

No.

No, I... I don't actually
wanna talk about that, but...



Well, how's the knee doing?

Ugh, really?

What the f... I just...

I wanted to have a drink
with a friend

and shoot the shit...

And you had to fuckin'...

ISAAC:
All right.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Wait a second, no, no, no.

Don't t...

Uh, wait, are you...
are you one of those people?


What do you mean? What?

I don't know,
like the kinda people

that get all
like antsy around guns.

ISAAC: No. Not at all.
No.

No, I've been... I've actually
been shooting before.


I've been riding for you for...

RICK:
For what?

For what? Like a year
and a half now and uh...

RICK:
Relax!

W... why are you like

all fuckin' wound tight
and shit?

It's not loaded,
so don't go freakin' out.

(Phone rings)

I gotta take this really quick,
like it... it's my boss.

What? I'm your fuckin' boss!

Hey, it's like
a potential sponsor, you know?

I gotta...
I'll be back in a few minutes.

Wait, wait, are you...
wait, are you che...

Are... are you...
are you cheating on me?

He's from France,
you don't know him.

RICK: I...
(Chuckles)

I fuckin' hate France!

I fuckin' hate France.




What the fuck did you say
to him?

He's been pounding scotch,

making all these
infidelity jokes.

(Taking deep breaths)

He knows something.

Please just refrain
from fucking us over

for one more hour.

Can you do that?

He's completely fucked!


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Well, I can't keep this shit up.


Not at the rate
he's been drinking

and the things he's been saying.

You need to stop
being a fucking pussy.

The dude is on a fucking bender!

You need to get out of there.

Let's... let's not meet back
at my place.

Screw that.

Bring the shit over here

and we're gonna leave sooner,
okay?

It's going to be fine,
it's going to be fine.

Trust me, okay?


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Takes deep breath)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Gun blares)
(Chuckles)

Whoa, man.
RICK: Oh.

What's wrong with you, man?
RICK: Oh.

ISAAC:
What... what's going on?

I thought you were gonna fall
in the shitter.


Ain't nothing wrong with me,
alright?

Fucking great.

I'm three for three.

And it's your turn, pussy.

Uh, are you sure
you wanna be shooting out here?

You know... (Chuckles)
What're you talkin' about?

Hey, we're friends, right?
ISAAC: Yeah.

Fuckin' friends shoot guns
together.

It's what they do.

I don't want you
gettin' in trouble, alright?

(Chuckles)
Don't worry about me.

You're hidin' somethin'.

ISAAC:
I'm not hiding anything, man.

I know.
Come on, do what you got!

We're all out of bottles.

(Insects chirping in background)

Fuck.

Fall off this motherfucker.


Problem solved.

Come on, fuckin' shoot me.
Come on!

ISAAC: Well,
get the hell out of the way, man!

(Insects chirping in background)

ISAAC: I'm not gonna fuckin' shoot
you, come on.


ISAAC:
Come on.

Shit, what the fuck, man?


It's my gun.

ISAAC:
I know that.

Bolt action, M1.

(Gun cocks)

ISAAC:
Alright.

All right, just uh... I got that.

I think I'll figure it out.

(Chuckles) You sure?
Yeah.


I'll figure it out from here,
alright?

RICK: Oh!
ISAAC: I got it.

Whoa, ho, ho!
Okay.

No one gets hurt, you know?
RICK: I know.

Well, you can't...
you can't just go

takin' things from me.

What do you mean
taking things from you?

Oh, no, just...
it's just a little observation

I've been makin' lately.

It seems that you like
to take things from me.

Well, just... just a feeling.

Well, I don't know
what it is you're feeling, Rick.

I'm not...

You're fuckin' my fiancÃ©e!

Fuckin' idiot!
(Gunshot)

RICK:
Isaac!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

RICK:
Oh!

Uh, oh, oh!

No!

(Rick sobbing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

ISAAC:
I'm nervous.

VALERIE:
Why?

ISAAC: I feel like they're
getting suspicious.

VALERIE:
They're not.

And they won't be.

ISAAC:
Oh, yeah?

What makes you so fuckin' sure?

VALERIE: They think we're
strangers, Isaac.

Trust me.

ISAAC:
I'm worried about Rick.

VALERIE: Baby,
we already went over this.

ISAAC:
He's a total fucking mess.

He could be a problem.

He's the only person
who can tie us together.

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What the fuck.

(Taking deep breaths)

What the fuck.

(Taking deep breaths)

Fuck!

God!


(Engine starts)

(Thunder rumbling)

What the fuck
were you guys up to?

Fuck!


Hey, Jimmy, come on, man,
pick up.

Please!

Pick... pick up.

(Phone ringing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hello.

Hey, fuck, I...
I'm in a lot of trouble, man.

I... I... I n...
I need your help, okay?

You help me and I'll help you
with that thing, I promise.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

Tell me what happened.

It's fuckin' over, man.

W... what did you do?

I can't help you
if I don't know what you did.

It's Isaac and Valerie, okay?

It was an accident.

They're... they're fuckin' dead.

And when I ran, I... I ran,
I got into Valerie's car...

Fuck!

I got into my car

and there was a fuckin' bag
in there...

They're rippin' me off, man.

Jimmy, you know,
I would never hurt Val.

Um, well, my advice would be
to go to the cops,

but you ran already

and that's not
a very smart move, buddy.

I... I'm just...
I'm drivin' around, okay?

I don't know
where the fuck I am.

Please, man, please.

So you should probably go
to a friend's house and...

And lie low for a little bit.

Okay, I... I... I'll...
I'll be there soon.

JIMMY:
What? No, no, no, no!

You think
they won't check my house?

<i>What the fuck
is wrong with you?</i>

Fuck, no, no!

Okay, look, yeah,
I know somebody.

Oh, fuck!

Okay.

(Bike vrooming)

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Conrad laughing)

CONRAD:
Fool!

Have you even made contact
with your boy?

It's 9:00 and you've given me
no indication that...

That we're doing business.

I'm losing my patience.

I will give you
until 12:00 noon, tomorrow.

Not... not 1:00
or something, "Oh, 12:30."

No.

Noon, tomorrow.

Listen, you creepy fuck.

When shit gets messy,

I have my own way
of gettin' this cleaned up.

Do that, mate.


I'll be in touch.

CONRAD:
You can touch your own cock.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(Vehicles whooshes)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Engine starting)

(Insects chirping in background)

(Indistinct radio chatter
in background)

(Thunder rumbling)

You guys
check the security cameras?

Front cams are
the only ones workin'.

Convenient.

DETECTIVE MORRISON:
She worked at the museum.

We should send someone
over there.

OFFICER THOMPSON:
What do you think?

I don't like makin' assumptions.

OFFICER: Found a scorecard
from the Golf Club.

Today's date.

Might still be open.

Take one of the boys with you.

(Taking a drag)

(Phone ringing)

Yo, what's up?

CONRAD:
Any sign of him?

No, I haven't,
but I swope by Rick's spot.

Bad scene, yellow tape, lights,
homicide detectives.

Looks like somebody
caught a body

in that motherfucker.

CONRAD:
<i>Fuck!</i>

You need to find Rick.

Yuppie fuck has a second house
on the Southend.

<i>Cops won't be there.</i>

Yeah, dead ass.

Yeah, yeah, alright, I got it.

CONRAD:
Do what you do.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Come on!

(Taking deep breaths)

(Distorted speech)

(Rain pattering)



(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

DETECTIVE MORRISON: Yeah,
I was wonderin' if you happen to see

a certain member
around here today.

Rick Van Pelt.

Ah, Rick.

Yeah, he does his drinking
on the course.

Um, doesn't come into the bar
that often.

You want a drink?

Nah, thanks, I'm good.

But you can tell me
do you know somebody

with the initials DRJ.

Looks like Rick was on the links
with him earlier today.

You know, I could have somebody
pull the members list,

but that won't be
until tomorrow morning

at the earliest.

It's not initials.

It's Dr. J, it's his name.

Yeah, right, Dr. Jimmy,
goes by Dr. J.

Um, weird fella.

Thanks. Get this guy a drink.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

NACHO: Yo, Oscar, we ran through
this whole damn yuppie house.

No Rick.

Looks like Ricky been
chillin' with our boy

Dr. Jimmy dog.

OSCAR: <i>Guys, you know how much
that piece of shit owes us</i>

<i>and our suppliers.</i>

NACHO:
I bet.

I'll keep you in the loop,
big dog.

OSCAR: <i>Nacho,
don't come back without Rick.</i>

RICK:
<i>Hey, Malcolm, it's... it's Rick.</i>

<i>Um, yeah, uh,
I'm just at the gate.</i>

<i>Uh, kinda need a favor.</i>

(Door buzzes)


Whoa!

Ha-ha!


Malcolm!

Rick, how are you?


Uh, fuck, I've been better.

Just uh, just lookin' for a...
a familiar place to stay.

Oh, not to worry,
we've all been there.


You need help
with any of those bags?

RICK:
No, I'm okay, it's uh...

(Rick grunts)

Just this.

Ah,
just the bare necessities, huh.

Gym bag and a mystery package.

Is that a gift in exchange
for my hospitality?


No, I just uh,
I grabbed what I could.

Uh, yeah, I don't think
it's gonna work out w...

With me and Val.

Things went south pretty quick.

Oh, I'm really sorry, man.

Get in here, huh?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Yeah, hope you don't mind,
but I have a bit of company.

Looks like someone
had a bit too much.

What's the uh...
what's the occasion?

I mean for the party?

Oh, I uh,
just played at the grand opening

of a new club last night.

Real wild shit, you know?

Yeah.


Wild is right.


And the party followed me here.

As you can see there's
no shortage of beautiful dames.

But enough of that.

Let's show you
to your sleeping quarters,

good sir.

MALCOLM: (Chuckles)
I've missed you, Rick.

This really is a nice surprise.

Yeah, I uh...
I wish the circumstances were...

Were better.

I mean maybe tomorrow,
after breakfast,

we... we can catch up.

I'm fuckin' wrecked, man,
I gotta hit the sack.

That's totally cool,
perfectly fine.

Now let's see here.
What's behind door number one?

(Woman grunting)

Moving on.

Ah, that's more like it.

Sorry about that.

This place can turn
into quite the love shack.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Uh, fuck, the last couple hours

um, you know, I...
I didn't even see it comin'.

Yeah, if you
don't mind me prying a bit,

what happened with you
and Valerie?

She was fuckin' my team captain.

Captain of the fuckin' team
that I own.

Yeah, that's heavy.

Yeah, and uh, I don't know, I...

It didn't end...
it didn't end pretty,

but that... that's another story.

Well, if it's any consolation,
I was never a big fan.


Uh, yes, it's... it's good
to have somebody on my side.

Hmm, you want my advice?

Take a shower
and get some shut-eye.

I'll see you in the morning.

Now if you need anything,
I'm just down the hall.

Thanks.

Oh, and uh,
knock first if you do.


(Oscar laughing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Knocking on door)

JIMMY:
This is Dr. J.

Hi, doctor,
I'm with the police.

I need to ask you
a couple of things.

Are you a cop or a detective?

Detective.

Do you mind if I come in?

It's a little too late
for a house call.

<i>Not that I do house calls,
but...</i>

<i>Yeah, give me two minutes.</i>

Alright, I'll wait.

How can I help you?

Your patient, friend,
Rick Van Pelt.

You know where he is?

JIMMY:
Not at the moment.

I last spoke to him
this afternoon.

Hmm, where exactly was that?

We played a couple of rounds
together.

Uh, can I ask
what all this is about?

You know,
something serious went down

at Rick's place tonight.

A couple of people are dead.

Close associates.

So now I'm...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

Do I need to have
a fucking lawyer here?

Doctor, listen to me.

I'm not here to incriminate you
or Rick.

I'm just here to find out
what happened.

And why.

Can we help each other?

Well,
it is of my professional opinion

that Rick is not capable
of murdering anybody.

If you change your mind
and wanna help your friend,

here's my card.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Did you guys find anything else?

OFFICER THOMPSON: <i>Isaac,
the gym where he trains at,</i>

I think you and your boys
in Vice know him

pretty fuckin' well.

The fuckin' steroids
are runnin' the whole show.

A couple of days ago,

a few guys got popped
on a coke bust

holdin' a decent stash
of juice.

High-quality shit that Oscar
and his goons push.

OFFICER THOMPSON:
Juice heads.

Cyclists.

This shit
could be international.

<i>Oscar fucks up, we got him.</i>

(Vehicles whooshing in distance)

VOICE:
You killed them.

You killed them.

You killed them.

Rick Van Pelt is dead.


(Indistinct speech)




CONRAD: You know,
I've owned this piece for 23 years.

It... it's been
in my gallery for 17

and nobody paid it
a second thought

until the artist disappeared.

And then all of a sudden,
it spiked.

It's become my most s...
sought-after piece.

Now why would anybody
think that way?

Why would anybody get enjoyment
out of such images of pain?

Hmm.

Detective Morrison.

Homicide.

Oh.

I thought you were an educator

the way you were
admiring my work.

I... I know
it's a little pretentious

to have a...
a gallery where you...

As much as I'd love to discuss
uh, all of this,

I need to ask you
a couple of questions

about your employee
Valerie Renard.

Ask away.

Well, I imagine you were one
of the last people

to see her alive.

She was shot in the throat
earlier this evening.

Oh.

Uh, no, I um...

She... she... she... she...
she was my assistant um,

but... but... she... she...

Oh, she was a real close friend.

Sir...

did she have any reason
to steal from you?

Was she supposed to be
in possession

of one
of your establishment's pieces?

No.

B... but if you talk to Valerie,
I'm s...

Sir, she's dead.

I... oh.

I... if you could ask her,
she'd have an explanation.

She'd have an explanation.


Did you recover the painting?

No.

But we're almost certain
it's in the possession

of our prime suspect.

You... you've got a suspect?

Her fiancÃ©.

Rick Van Pelt.

They were engaged
for a few months,

but uh,
hadn't dated very long prior.

It's late.

(Conrad grunts)

Come down the station tomorrow
and talk to the boys.

Alright.

One last thing.

Send over the access code
to your security camera server.

Send it now.

(Vehicles whooshing in distance)


His therapist knows something.

He didn't give me much
to work with,

but I think he wants to help.

OFFICER THOMPSON: What about
Andy Warhol over there?

He doesn't wanna talk,
but he knows something.

I got a weird fuckin' feeling
about that guy.

You can see it in his eyes.

Dude's on another planet.

Yeah, first off, he doesn't
leave the fucking gallery.

Then he went dead silent
when I asked him to come in.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Plus, I've heard
he's into darker shit,

if you know what I mean.

(Bell dings)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

DETECTIVE MORRISON:
Money laundering.


DETECTIVE MORRISON:
Trafficking.

Missing people.





Ooh, that's some good shit,
Jimbo.

JIMMY:
Uh, office hours are closed.

That's not what we ask,
motherfucker.

Um, uh, can I... can I help you?

Come on, man, you bet
a lot of money on your partner,

didn't you?

Come on, man.

You know them French fucks
are gonna come cut you up, man.

They ain't as nice as me.


I'm willing to comply
with whatever you need.

Um, there's a...
there's a safe upstairs

with a combination.

Man, I'm not lookin'
for no money.

I'm lookin' for Rick, man.

Well, um,
I haven't spoken with him.

GOON 1:
Where the fuck is Rick at?

Yeah.
MAN 8: Where's Rick?

GOON 2:
Yeah, give us fuckin' Rick.

GOON 3:
You gonna speak!

Look, I do... I... I... I...
I don't know where he is.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Phone rings)

MALCOLM:
Yes, master?

CONRAD:
<i>Malcolm.</i>

<i>Malcolm, my dear boy.</i>

So you're trippin' the light
fantastic tonight?

I've got a feeling
you don't care

and something's wrong.

I know that you and Valerie
traveled in the same circles.

MALCOLM:
Yes, we've met.

For once, I may actually
have something you need.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Well, she was handling
a rather large transaction

for me this evening.

It was a very expensive piece.

It seems to have gone missing.

<i>As well as the enumeration
for that piece.</i>

And I was wondering
whether somebody in your circle

might know
what the hell's goin' on, hmm?

Her fiancÃ© Rick Van Pelt
just so happened

to stumble
through my front gate tonight.

He seems to have
some odd luggage with him.

Looked like your missing piece.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Yes, he's still here.

Yeah, he's holed up
in my guest room.

Yes, I'll keep him here.

Don't worry.


Oh, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Well, don't wait too long
to send out your dog.

The dog will be there.


(Knocking on door)
MALCOLM: Hey!

Give me a sec.

Hey, uh, what's up, man?

I... I was just...
just about to go to sleep.

Yeah, sorry,
I was just checkin' on you.

Makin' sure
you got yourself settled.

I couldn't quite seem
to fall asleep.

I... is everything okay
out there?

I... I thought
I heard some voices earlier.

No, that was probably
those drunken lovebirds

down the hall.

I can go and tell 'em
to shut their yappers

if they're keepin' you awake.

No! No.

Well, on that note
I'll leave you be,

but uh, if you wanna catch up
or if you want a nightcap,

like I said,
I'm just down the hall.

Not sleeping.


All right.

(Takes a deep breath)

(Phone ringing)

Come on, man, fuckin' pick up.

Pick up.

(Answering machine beeps)

Hey.

Hey, it's me, it's Rick.
Call me back.

Jimmy, call me back.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Bike vrooming)

â™ª I'm not alive â™ª

â™ª I am not alive â™ª

â™ª I think I hate myself â™ª

â™ª Or maybe I'm just bored â™ª

â™ª I feel their teeth on me â™ª

â™ª With plastic lungs â™ª

â™ª I feel on top of the world â™ª

â™ª But it could be much better,
better â™ª

â™ª Staring at the wall,
I become one with â™ª

â™ª All things that mean nothing â™ª

â™ª Cottonmouth kid
with the new fit, livin' it up â™ª

â™ª That's what they all
seem to think â™ª

â™ª So I smile for you â™ª

â™ª That's what you want me
to do â™ª

â™ª I think I hate myself â™ª

â™ª Or maybe I'm just bored â™ª

â™ª I feel their teeth on me â™ª

â™ª With plastic lungs â™ª

â™ª I feel on top of the world â™ª

â™ª But it could be much better,
better â™ª

â™ª It could be better â™ª

â™ª It could be better â™ª

â™ª It could be better â™ª

â™ª It could be better â™ª

â™ª It could be better,
but nothing's okay â™ª

â™ª And my mood is
like the weather â™ª

â™ª I've been pacing and racing â™ª

â™ª Just tryin'
to keep it together â™ª

â™ª I just wanna be better â™ª

â™ª Smoke a hole in my throat â™ª

â™ª 'Cause if I stare at a wall
one more fuckin' time â™ª

â™ª I might just lose my mind â™ª

â™ª Tell me that I'm fine,
the world is fake like a pump â™ª

â™ª That's why I'm on top â™ª

â™ª Waiting to jump off â™ª


â™ª Let me jump â™ª

(Gun blares)


(Gun blares)

(Whirring in distance)

Found this in the room.

Well, at least, you don't
have to do that shit here.

That would have been a bummer.

Like for me.

(Bike vrooming)

(Insects chirping in distance)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Thunder rumbling)

(Takes a deep breath)


Let's talk.

Um...

This uh, idea of yours...

Mmhmm.
Yeah.

What if...

...we just left?


Left?

Left?

In a couple of weeks,

I'll have an off-the-market
Conrad Wilhelm and...

I'm gonna have Oscar's money.

So...

what if...


So... (Chuckles)

So just... what?

Like fuck the deal?

Yeah.

Fuck them and fuck Rick.

Well, Val, I'm the team captain,
I can't just like disappear.

Sorry to tell you this, Isaac,
but he's cutting you.

That was one fuckin' race!

We came in third!

We were still on the podium.


Rick wants to win at all costs.

And he's taking it out
on you now,

and he's been taking it out
on me since the injury.

This is the way out,

for both of us.

I need a moment
to think about it.

That's a lot to take in.


You're fucking crazy.

Yeah, hmm.

OSCAR:
Fuck you.

I've been workin'.

My boys got a lead.

They're over there right now
shaking 'em down,

but he ain't talkin'.

No, no, no, no.

Forgive me if I have my doubts
about you and your associates,

but I have gone past
being patient.

My guys are gonna do
what they do.

Roid rage is not going
to solve our problem.

Better watch your mouth,
old man.

Roid rage is for fools!

Don't fuck with us!

For fools!

You're gonna end up drawing
more attention

to everyone involved!

Talk soon, asshole.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Mouse clicks)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

You lyin' sack of shit.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Come on, Jimbo,
don't make us spend all night

helping you remember shit.

You know, I've got ADHD.

JIMMY:
I... I swear to God,

I don't fucking know
where he is.

I can't give any other answer
than the truth.

Don't make me ask you again,
motherfucker.

(Gun blares)

What do you want?

I swear on my fucking life
I do not know where Rick is,

and I do not know who they are,
nor who you are,

nor who sent you, nor why.

Just please know I had nothing
the fuck to do with this.

You can...
you can set that anywhere.

You can...

(Indistinct speech)

Uh, please don't harm me.

I'm a medical professional.

I'm just a common...
just a... I'm a doctor.

I'm a therapist.

Just please spare me my life.

(Phone ringing)

Um, I... I...

THE ASSASSIN:
No.

(Answering machine beeps)

RICK:
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

<i>Jimmy, pick up.</i>

<i>Answer your phone!</i>

Fuck are you, man?

I... look, I need your help.

<i>That...
that thing that's after me,</i>

<i>I don't fucking know it,
alright?</i>

It's the freakiest shit
I've ever fuckin' seen.

<i>He shot my fuckin' car,</i>

he was chasing me
on a fuckin' motorcycle.

I don't know, I...

<i>Uh, I got lucky.</i>

<i>I... I f... I fuckin' lost him.
I... I don't know.</i>

<i>I think I found
a couple of hotels a...</i>

A few miles off the interstate
just west of town.

Listen to me, you come out here
when you get this,

and I'll... I'll let you know
where I am.

I... I... I can't find my phone.

I don't know, I fuckin' lost it.

I'll find you.

Just get out here.

<i>Hopefully, I'll see you soon.</i>

<i>I don't know.
Just... look, be careful.</i>

<i>I don't fuckin' know.</i>

He could be comin' for you.

Just... just be careful, man,
please.

Jesus fucking Christ.


Oh, damn it!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(Chime rings)

What can I do for you?

Hey, boss,
uh, you got any rooms?

We got those.

Okay, alright.

Uh, you have...
do you have anything private

down on the end?

It's 55 a night.

Do-do-do-do.


Yeah.

Here's your key.

RICK:
Here.

Keep the change.

Thank you.

Where am I goin'?

NIGHT CLERK:
It's on the end, like you asked.

Alright.


(Taking deep breaths)

Yeah uh, hello,
I need to report three...

No, uh, four murderers murdered.

Thank you.


(Vehicle whooshes)

(Insects chirping in background)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Thunder rumbling)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

DETECTIVE MORRISON:
Four dead goons.

(Camera shutter clicks)

DETECTIVE MORRISON:
A gun registered in his name.

(Camera shutter clicks)

A ghost killer with no eyes.

(Camera shutter clicks)

DETECTIVE MORRISON: It don't look too
fucking good for your friend, doc.

Let alone real.

A lot of people died tonight.

(Indistinct radio chatter
in background)

Let's face it,
we both know it isn't Rick.

We do both know that, right?

You saw him?

Well, nobody seems
to wanna believe me, but yeah.

Yeah, I saw him.

I've seen him, too,
a couple of times.

Scary fucker.

You should have Rick call me,
we should meet,

'cause right now,
I'm the only one on his side.

The evidence is pilin' up
and we both know

that the law isn't
the only thing chasin' his tail.

I uh.

I think I know
where Rick might be.

We shouldn't go alone, though.

Why is that?

Because that freak in there

heard the answering machine
message.

I was sittin' in a chair with...
he had a gun to my head

and what was I supposed to do?

I...

Well, I wanna get
this spooky fuck in cuffs

before the sun comes up.

If we have company, so be it.

It's a really shitty motel.

(Indistinct radio chatter
in background)

Did he just take the witness?


(Bike vrooming)

DISPATCHER: (On radio)
(Indistinct speech)


What?

Nothin'.

No one can have that look
on their face

and not be thinkin' nothin'.

I'm just thinkin'
about all the possibilities.

What possibilities?

How Rick got himself
into all this shit.

I mean
I'm a psychologist and all,

but some people are just fucked.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Sirens wailing in distance)


(Chime rings)

Hey, boss, I uh,
I got a favor to ask.

NIGHT CLERK: Sure, friend,
what can I do for you?

I'm in... I'm in kinda
unique sort of trouble.

I mean I'm...
I'm goin' out on a limb

even asking you.

But all my friends, I...
I thought I could count on...


Well, they just left me fuckin'
high and dry, man.

My experience?

Friends are hard to come by
this time of the night,

especially out here
in the middle of nowhere.

So um, what is it you need?


I'm happy you asked.

Do you uh, wanna be friends?


If anybody comes here

asking, looking,
anything for Rick Van Pelt,

you don't know nothin'.

And you call my room.

Oh, it's easy enough.

Happy to help.

RICK:
Great.

NIGHT CLERK: Oh, hey,
I can't lie to the cops

if they come sniffin' around.

Hey, not worried about the cops.

NIGHT CLERK:
Oh.

Oh, okay.

You take care now.


(Indistinct speech)

Yeah!

That's right,
you solve that puzzle.

Oh, shit.

Abracadabra,
that's a hell of a board.

(Indistinct speech)

Uh.

Uh.

(Bike vrooming)

(Thunder rumbling)

(Birds chirping in distance)

RICK:
Morning, Val.

Or uh,
should I say "late night"?

Funny.


No.

Not really.

(Slurps, gulps)

Um, I'm serious, where...
where were you last night?

I mean I...
I tried to find you all night.

Conrad had a group of investors
at the museum.

I had to work late.

Really?

Because I sent Jimmy
to the gallery

and all the lights were off.

Wow, fucking psycho.

We went out afterwards.

Why don't you trust me?

RICK:
You just fuckin' lie to me

and this has been goin' on
for a while, hasn't it?

(Birds chirping in background)

You're holed up at this house

and it's making you
fucking paranoid.

(Birds chirping in background)


Hey, hey, hey, man.

You lookin' for the party, man?

You lookin' for the party,
I got everything you want, bro.

RICK:
Uh, I'm good.

Where you goin'?

Where you goin'?

Fuckin'
warlock-lookin' motherfucker.



Fuck.

(Takes a deep breath)

Fuckin' phone, Jesus Christ.

(Taking deep breaths)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

You in my neighborhood,
I'm tryin' to talk to you!

I asked if you're lookin'
for the party, man.

I don't want a party, okay?

Come on, hey, hey,
you ain't got to be scared,

you ain't got to be scared!

RICK: Oh! Oh!
Fuckin' listen to me now!

I'm tryin' to help you out,
motherfucker!

I just want some change.
I just want some fuckin' change.

RICK:
Okay, okay.

Look, look, we...
we can work this out.

I'm gonna...
I'm gonna grab my wallet.

I'm gonna give you
everything I have, okay?

What you got?
We can work this out, okay?

Let's work it out.
Okay.

Don't fuckin'... don't you
fuckin' fuck with me now.

What you got there?
Let me see it.

Fat stacks.
Let me see it.

Oh, oh yeah.
Fuckin' rich boy Jaycee...


(Taking deep breaths)


(Thunder rumbling)

(Bike vrooming)

(Taking deep breaths)

(Car whirring)

If it's safe and I need you,
I'll call you.

Jesus, Rick.

You got that?

If you see anything,
fucking call me, please.

(Bike whirring)

(Tire deflates)

(Chime rings)

(Clears throat)


Lookin' for a guy,

would have checked in
the last 24 hours.

Gray hair, beard,
camo head to toe.

God, damn it.

What?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Yep, he's here.

Room 20, down on the end

Thanks.

Holy shit, thanks
and get out of here,

fuckin' cop.

(Rotating phone dial)

(Phone ringing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Gun blares)

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Glass shattering)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Jimmy!

Rick, I thought you got shot.

(Taking deep breaths)

M... M... Morrison.

He knows
where this all leads, Rick.

He knows.

I gotta go do this on my own.

I gotta stay with the car!

(Insects chirping
and dog barking in distance)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Stop fuckin' runnin' away
and listen to me, asshole.

Do you know what...
Shut the hell up

if you wanna get out
of here alive.

10 years now,
Wilhelm's phantom killer

has been knockin' off
every high-profile witness,

gangster, you name it,
but he doesn't exist.

There's not a shred of evidence,

and I may not have another shot
to catch this fucker alive.

Huh?

(Taking deep breaths)

Do you think I wanted to be...
What did I just say?

Shut the fuck up, alright?

We need to be smarter than him.

We gotta keep moving, alright?

We need to fuckin' move, now.

(Gun cocks)


Fuck, can't... can't you just
call for backup?

No, man,
because he's a fuckin' ghost.

If he gets spooked,
poof, he's gone.

And then guess
who this all gets pinned on?

What the fuck?

Are you... I mean what's your...
what's your plan?

Why are we still hiding?
You're a fuckin' cop!

I don't exactly do things
by the book.

RICK:
What is that supposed to mean?

It means you're the bait.
RICK: No.

Yeah.
RICK: No, no, no, no, no.

You know, he's been chasing me
all... all day.

Uh, my knee I c... I can't...

Exactly, you're leaking.

He'll go exactly
where we need him to, alright?

Now, there's a concrete plant
just north of here.

I want you to go there
and meet me.

RICK: (Scoffs)
You're fuckin' insane.

Do you want to fuckin' die?

Go.


(Howling in distance)

(Thunder rumbling)

(Rain pattering)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Thunder rumbling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

(Thunder rumbling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Thunder rumbling)

(Gun blares)

(Gun blares)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Bravo.

You tightened up
another loose end.

Too bad about Oscar.

Oscar was an idiot.

You.

You have been
my greatest investment.

My greatest achievement.

The sun will be up
in a few minutes.

End it.

End it.

End it!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


VOICE:
(Indistinct speech)

Find the truth in the night.

(Indistinct speech)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Gunshots in distance)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hmm, I smell blood.

I hope they didn't put up
too much of a fight.

You know,
things got unnecessarily messy.

Ugly.

Man, who can you trust?

Well, here, l... let...
let me see.

I hope with all the commotion,
it didn't lose any value.

I certainly will be able
to find another buyer.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Gun blares)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Indistinct chatter
in background)



Uh, fuck, man.

H... how much for the car?

Well, it was um...
it's 150 for the tire,

but I think I deserve a bonus.


There you go.

How's that?

That should cover it.
(Scoffs)

Look, man, um...

I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry about all this.

I don't know
when I'll see you next,

I don't know where I'm goin'.

Probably south.

Well, be safe, buddy.

We'll get you back.

Peace out.

Yeah.

Go.
