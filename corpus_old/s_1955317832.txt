#EXECUTIVE TARGET#

You asked my advice Mr. President
and all I’m saying...

All you're saying Mack,is that I should
screw my conscience, along with about

two hundred and fifty million people, in
order to save a few jobs in an elitist group,

primarily made up of people who are
still living in fantasy land!

Now I didn't become the president of
the United States to make friends, Mack.

God knows if i wanted to do that, I
would have stayed in New Jersey.

I took this position to do the best job
I could for the good of the whole country.

I'm just saying it shouldn't be so drastic,
for security reasons.

Look I can no longer justify spending
billions of dollars on ludicrous projects

with people walking around the streets
homeless and hungry.

With all due respect Mr.President I don't
think security of the country is ludicrous.

Mack you're a good solder. The security of
the country is what it is cause men like you.

I'm just hoping that if we move towards a
better tomorrow, somebody will say that

that was the responsibility of me.
I hope so too.

Mr. President they're ready for you, sir.
Thank you.

Come on. This is gonna be
hard enough to pass as it is.

I'm gonna need you to cover my ass in
this one partner.

I'm gonna need your help!
Yes sir, let's do it!

I like to thank you all for attending what
I’m sure will be historic event.

Our guest today is a man who was
elected four short years ago on a platform

of returning government to the people. In
those 4 years he has exceeded this promise.

Today he will unveil a new plan which will
launch us into the next century as a nation

devoted of poverty and fear. A nation willing
to take the next great step forward.

The city of New York is proudly chosen as our
beautiful city, is the launching path

for this new journey,so ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you very much.

I'm sure that most of you
know why I’m here today.

In fact Washington has never been known for
keeping secrets. I tell my security people

that if they want to study infiltration
techniques just keep on eye on the press.

I'm going to lay some rumors to rest.

This is going to be a step on a long journey
that is not without detractors.

I'm here to ask for youre support.

We all know the cuts have to be made. The
high paranoid spending of the eighties

is no longer acceptable in the nineties.
Star Wars belongs in the movies,

and should be financed by Hollywood, not
Washington and the American people!

The American people can no longer justify
letting things like education,environment,

social security medical fall on the wayside,
while billions of dollars are being spent

for six hundred and fifty dollar
toilet seats ordered by the Pentagon.

It's time to start spending our money in the
right places,the essential places.

Now we owe this to our children.We owe this
to the children of the world.

America is a leader a super
power and a super power

should not only be strong in the skies,
it should be strong on the ground.

However I’m not for a
moment going to sacrifice

the safety of the land we live in, nor the
freedoms that we so cherish,

but it is time to get our priorities in
order.

Quit a moving speech Mr.President full of
usual drama, short on down home intelligence.

Returning the government to the people come
on! I ask you this California,

are you going to allow some bleeding heart
president to cut thousands

of your defense industry jobs so he can take
your wages and disperse them among

dead beets who haven't worked a day in their
life? Give me a call here

on crn the station which stricks to the
politics. Hello you're on crn who’s this?

Betsy - What do you have to say Betsy?
I think that cutting military budget

and giving the money back to the
people is a really nice thing to do.

You call throwing thousands of your
fellow Californians out of work nice!

There's our boy.

Yeah.
Chicken's in the coup.

Let's go!

We agree that the defense
industry provides over

a hundred thousand jobs in
the state of California... - Right!

Hay will you turn that ass whole off! - Hay
you ought to knock it off you fuckin nut,

before i come back there and kick your ass!
The only time you'd have the guts

is when I have these fuckin things on.
I'm telling you shut up!

Fuck you!

Fuck you too!

What they say is meaningless, which is why
what they don't say is most important

Next caller, hello you're on crn.

involved in a major accident

You're such a fuckin idiot.

What now Einstien?
Just let me think a second.

Heading west on stellar
coming up on gram.

Hey wait! Stay there!

What are you doing?

Whoever ambushed this bus obviously
wanted one of 'em real bad.

Here's a list of the thirteen that got away.
Headquarters is running a background check

on their family and friends.We should be able
to catch most of those geniuses that way.

Give Carelli and Smith half the list,
you and me will take the other half.

So we do six.

Do you like dusting today?
Bella,I wore this especially for you.

Mersey boque.

If my wife was as beautiful
as you I’d still be married.

If your wife was as beautiful as me,
she never would have married you.

I gotta tell you, self-control is not my
strong point.- Well I’ll take care of that.

Really?
Well thank you.

You're hurting me. - Haven’t I told you a
million times, no touching the customers!

Pal, take it easy will ya?
We were just kidding around.

You sit down!You sit down! - Hey, hey hey,
don’t you touch me! - You're outta here!

What the fuck, you go! Hey fuck you too!

Fuckin bastered,

fuckin prick. Bitch.

Bela! - Fuck. You scared the shit out of
me. - I need some help.

No shit. For life, five minutes
ago where the hell were ya?

Here waiting for you. You gotta
car? - Yeah down the block.

What the hell you doing?
Get me outta here would you?

I like that outfit. I
like the matching cuffs.

Come on! Want a beer?

I don't want to be rude, but I’d like to get
rid of these first if you don't mind?

What's a matter, bondage is not
your style? - Na.

Well nothing much has
changed around here

What, you think I be gone too far?

Is that what you think? - I don't know.
Yeah maybe a little.

Those are for safety wise guy. Some woman
locked me to that bed one night, six hours.

Had to call in the neighbors to help me, it
was embarrassing as hell.

They think I’m a fuckin pervert.

What’re you doing ha?
I'm gonna cut them off

Those are good cuffs, you're
gonna ruin them? - Get me out!

I sure missed you Bela.

You to my man.
It's good to be back.

Still working on the gas formula?

You bet. I'm getting'close too. Pretty soon
I’ll have the best fuel

the stock car world has ever known.

"Bela's brew" I’m gonna
call it... Be famous.Be rich.

Buy my own strip joint.
Have a seat partner,

here put your feet up, and ha come on!

Come on! - Have you seen her?
Have you spoken to her?

Not since the last time I banged her.
Is that supposed to be funny?

I'm talking about my wife!
I know.

Come on, don't tell you've
lost your sense of humor.

May be I did, along with my self-respect,
dignity. - That's what she lost!

Why don't you just go ahead and pick
my heart out when you're done with that

It'd be fair play...

So... You don't know
who these people were?

I have no idea. One minute I’m on the bus,
next thing I know the fuckin thing turns over,

these people come rushing in their putting
guns to my face. There's cops everywhere,

they hustle me out of the bus, everybody is
shooting. I jumped in a car and i took off,

I don't know what the hell was going on!
Life is such an adventure ain't it?

Yeah!

What're you gonna do now?
I'm gonna turn myself in...

I got a year left and I’m gonna do it.

Then why'd we bother removing these?
Because I want to see Nadia.

Nick you know... - I never had a chance to
explain myself.

That prosecutor had t in for me from
the get go. - Ah come on Nicky, fact it.

You got caught with your hand in the cookie
jar. Everybody knows you've been

screwing ‘around on her for months. I mean
the only way you ever get her listen to you

is to tie her up, and you say you're not into
that, so... - Let me tell you one thing,

I love my wife more than anything else
in the whole world and I miss her Bela

and I gotta see her no matter what.I don't
know who these people are or what the fuck

they want from me, but I’m gonna go see her!
The least you can do

is make a better appearance... A man
is often judged by his clothes...

I'll lend you some of mine.
Yeah but no polyester.

Who's next?
Nick James.

Is that the same Hollywood stunt driver
James? - Vic, what's wrong?

The jerkoff had a great career go in' till he
got busted with an eighteen year old girl

with a purse full of cocaine. Blowed his
whole life. Stupid bastard...

What's the address?
Last address is 8487 West Alvarado.

Hi ya baby.

I love people with habits.
What took you so long Nicky boy?

Men are so predictable.
So are cops.

Fuck! Get rid of them!
Don ho you come with me!

Now listen to me all right? I want
you to answer the door.

You get rid of these fuckin'cops and nothing
is gonna happen to you, let's go!

I'm not joking around with you don't
be foolish!

Nick?

Good evening mam, I’m officer Smoke,
this is my partner officer Green.

I'm sorry to bother you, but
we'd like to ask you a few questions.

About what?
Your husband

My husband? I haven't spoken to my husband
in almost a year... I really wouldn't know..

We don't mean to alarm you but, your
husband escaped tonight. - Escaped?

Do you think we would step in for a
minute?

It's so late and I was about to go to bed...
We'll just be a minute. I promise.

I'm sorry I, I can't let you in, unless you
have warrant. - We have a warrant mam.

Yeah we're trying to gather as much
information from the lab as we can.

The lab? Well who do you think did it, his
wife? She's never been arrested for so much

as stealing a piece of chewing gum. Why
should she suddenly just blow away two cops?

Na it was Nick James for sure and I
want that bastard alive!

Well I’ll put an apb on it
immediately - Brilliant idea.

Do I, do I at least get
a chance to plead my case.

You know even murderers get to do that.

Right on, brother.
Honey look

I met this girl once before that. Once.

I had no idea what she had in her purse...
She begged me for a ride,

that's all there was to it. - Oh, please,
please, please, please, please.

Shut the fuck up! - Oh please, please,
please, ple...

Hey shut up! You're bothering me
now. - Why? You want to hear this shit?

Yeah, I’m a sentimentalist.
So where are you taking us anyway?

To see da'man.

Here we are home sweet home, now
let's go, come on.

What the hell is this the bat cave? - Ever
heard of area 54, well this is area 55.

Shut up you big mouth
What?

Hey Nick James, hey
everybody it's Nick James.

Hey Nick, how you doing?

You know I cannot tell you what an honor and
a pleasure it is to finally meet you in person.

I've watched your entire career.
I trust your trip wasn't too unbearable.

I'm Lamar, oh I’m sorry is that any way to
treat guests? Take those cuffs off!

Look what the fuck is going on?
Patience Nick, everything in time.

Well fuck you, the time is now! I'd
like to know what we're doing here.

What do you want with us? - Look Nick,
let's not get our relationship started

out on the wrong foot. Go make her
comfortable!

Nick? - Hey!
Look it's gonna be fine.

Where are you taking her?
Don't worry Nicky boy,

I’ll take care of her like she was my own.
You're gonna get your mother fucker.

Keep an eye on him,make sure she's ok. She's
gonna be fine, everything is gonna be fine.

Look, look let's go play a game,

it's good for relaxing
the tension come on.

Come on!
I don't like games!

See, the whole city.

Quite an expensive little hobby
you got going on here for yourself.

I guess we're gonna play a game?

Cops and robbers. The red
one is you, the robber.

The objective is as in
life, to avoid destruction.

I'm ready when you are Mr.James.

Let's hit it!

Be careful Nick there are booby traps.

Catch up Nick, catch up!

Watch out for that car Nick.Ah, shit!

I guess I win.

You know I always wondered if
you guys can drive a car as well

on the streets as you do in the movies.
Let's not forget I lost those two jerks

you had following me, didn't I? - Well
I hope for your sake you'll be able

to duplicate that feat. - All right come on,
tell me what you want?

We've been experiencing a little cash flow
problem, but luckily there's a bank

that will help us replenish our finances.
What's that got to do with me?

You're gonna drive the getaway car! - I ain't
driving a getaway car and you can't make me!

Well no I can't, but your heart can.

She'll be in the next room waiting
patiently for your triumphant return.

Now should you not return
or become disagreeable,

she still die. But enough shop talk, why
don't you go and see Nadia.

I'm sure she'll want you to tell her that
everything's going to be just fine.

Hey beautiful.

Baby you gotta learn how to relax women,

bay be that hubby of your wouldn't stay down
 that other path. - Get your hands off of me!

Well if it ain't Rudolph Vazaleno. - That's
pretty funny.

Think I could have a moment alone with my
wife? - I don't know Nicky boy,

I don't think! She likes you anymore.
Yeah, where we gonna go?

We can't get out of here.
All right Ripple let's go!

May be you should talk to dr. Ruth, I
heard she's god about things like this.

Yeah you probably got her number. Could you
get her something to wear maybe?

Oh man Nadia?
Don't even try it Nick.

Why couldn't you just brake out of
jail and run off of Mexico somewhere!

Haven't you done me enough damage?
Did you have to drag me into this,

whatever the hell this place is?
I don't know who these people are?

Then why are we being held
here like animals Nick?

You had to have some kind of dealings with
them. - I swear to god

I don't know who they are! - God dam
it Nick, what is it that they want?

Can you at least hav the decency to tell me
that much? Well? Do you?

You wanna know? - Yeah. - You
really want to know? - Yeah I do.

You want to know what they want.
Yeah.

They want me to rob a bank.

Not me actually, but they want
me to drive the getaway car.

Are you crazy? - The only thing I’m crazy
about is you. - Oh Nick, please...

Yeah.

Look you hired me to do ajob and it
will be done, I promise it will be done!

Everything all right?
No, everything's not okay!

How in the hell could you let that happen
over at Nadia’s? - It was a...

It was a fuck up!

I told you I didn't want any attention
drawn to Nick James, didn't I?

Nothing what so ever, that would draw him
back to us, what so ever.

I mean do you know how long it took me
to find the right man. To find him?

Ripple just gets a little carried
away sometimes. - I am not finished!

Anonymity and precision are
the key elements to our success.

Without them we won't be
able to spend a fuckin dime.

We need the bait alive.

I mean, do you think for one
minute that they would pay us

or let us live if it were any different.

I'd will not allow anyone to jeopardize

this operation or my reputation!

It won't happen again.
No it won't!

I want you to dispose of Ripple.

Jesus Lamar, they were just fuckin cops.
That's not the point!

The point is he doesn't think.

Ripple and I have been partners for years.
I will not have an idiot fucking things up.

I do not want him to
return to this complex.

You brought him in you take him out.

You pick the time, you pick the place,

and the only thing I suggest is you
do it quickly!

So Dorothy, how are all our friends in
California? - Well sir, got my early reports,

not very happy. Our biggest objections are
going to come from Douglas.

That's where most of the cuts are going to
score direct hit, not that stock head

and burros aregoing to roll over that easily.
They're all going to come at you

with everything they have. - We’ll let them
bitch and moan all they want.

It's their own fault, they can't fight facts.
It wouldn't have happened if they weren't

so dam greedy in the first place. - Well, I
do believe that these four days

are going to be the toughest of our
 campaign, but if we can convince

the people of California that we can make up
for the loss of employment in other areas,

which we can. I think
the rest of the country

will have no problem accepting our plan.

You're doing the right thing sir.
I hope so!

What do you think? - That's supposed to be a
getaway vehicle,

I don't think anybody is gonna get away.

What do you suggest?

Whose vette is this?
It's mine.

Well I might need to borrow
a few parts, I’ll put them in here.

Anything for the cause, right?
Anything?

It will be a lot less
painful if you don't watch.

I got this straight off the internet.

A blueprint of the bank, ain't nothing
sacred anymore? - This ain't nothing'.

I got an e-mail thing going' on with this
chick. - Look can we interrupt this fantasy

just long enough to show us the vault?
Sure. Right there.

This corridor connects it with the lobby.
On the other side of this door,

there's an employee entrance leading out to
chandler street. That's where Nicky will be.

Whole job shouldn't take more thank four
minutes and forty five seconds.

Well then does everybody
know what to do?

Then good luck, and remember,
nothing happens to Nick James.

Not too bad Mr.Good Rench.
Not original, but not too bad.

Don't you have anything
else to do besides bug me?

I'd do your wife, but
she's takin' a nap.

Don't get cocky Nicky boy.
Right now you're our meal ticket,

but trust me, your days are
numbered. Thanksgiving's on it's way...

Get the fuck out of here!
Turkey.

Nadia?

Come sit down! - I thought Nick
was gonna be here, where is he?

I think you better sit down.

Now, he's right there.
What do you mean right there?

See the van your husband's in
has a sensor in it, so from right here

we can watch his whole little
adventure. Just like being there,

try it it's good.

Hey, hey, hey, what, what are you
doing? What do you want?

I'm just cleaning your window for a
dollar homs, it's awful dirty.

I ain't gotta dollar now get the fuck out of
here! Hey hey ho,

wipe off the rest of that would you? - For
somebody with no money you sure's hell picky.

Everything okay? - Absolutely officer
everything's fine.

Is this guy bothering you? - No sir, he's
not, he's just, cleaning off the window.

Well either keep it rolling' or put some
time in the meter! - Okay you got it.

Hey go away!

Hold right there!
Freeze!

Go Nick go! - Drop a weapons
and get out of the vehicle!

ARUSAAMATU TEKST.

In pursuit of suspect,
heading east on Chandler street.

Hurry it up will ya?

Now heading north on Olverado.

Why are the cops there? What's going on?
Part of the plan.

What do you mean the
plan? - Well we want to see

just how good of a driver
your husband really is.

It ain't my fault! - It's all
your fault! - Fuck you! - Shut up!

Why did you shoot that lady? - Because she
had a gun! - She didn't have nothing!

Shut up. Both of you!
Kill anyone, that wasn't part of the deal!

They were just gonna hand us the money
and say thank you for shopping with us.

Now do your job Mr.Stunt
man and lose assholes! - Shut up!

Head him off at Beverly...

He's heading south on Redheart.

Continuing on redheart.

Copy that we're closing in.

What's happening?
Way to go Nick.

10407 still in pursuit all other
units detain.

The drop off is here. Pull over!

Why is he stooping?
It's okay it's okay.

Great hit batman.

Come on, come on, let's go!
All right here's the number Nick,

anything happens, call it!

Hey Lacey, don't let
anything happen to Nadia!

Don't let anything happen to you!

Come on, let's go!

Move on, now!

Come on!
Ripple go back and help them!

What?
Come on,

come on, Vic come on! - Just leave
him he's gonna be a gimp anyway.

Get up get up! - I can't. - Yes
you can, come on, Ripple come here!

Give me the money and go back help them!

We're all gonna die, because of that
fat Fabio looking fuck. - Come on!

You go back and fuckin help them
Ripple! - Get up! Get up!

All right, all right, I’ll help them.

Get over here help me carry him!

Oh no!

Problem solved. - You fuckin piece
of shit you mother fucker!

Jack let him go! Jack let him go!

Lieutenant - Hold on a second.
Lieutenant, the bank robbery downtown,

who do you think is driving the
getaway van? - Nick James? - You got it.

All right, I’ll get back to you later. Bye.

Lacey come one! It's me
Ripple, what? More money for us.

Step out of the vehicle
you are surrounded.

Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

All right, thanks.

Well I checked with Simon,
the police don't have him.

Well maybe he's using an alias, and
they don't know yet. Check again.

Lamar, you're getting upset over nothing.
I mean, even if he is with the police

he doesn't know nothing remember
about anything?

If they ask him where
we are, he doesn't know.

Trust me, he'll call,

he won't jeopardize Nadia’s life.

Where'd you leave Ripple?
In the sewer.

That's a good place to leave Nick
James when this job is over.

I thought we were going to set him up? Then
turn him over to the cops when we were done?

Don't be ridiculous. When this jobs
done he's done. - And Nadia?

What?
And her?

You're beginning to sound
like Ripple. And her and her.

Look look look look, I’d like to be
alone okay? - Sure boss.

Where the hell you been? - Let's go!

Lost your appetite?

Didn't think you'd be that upset.

Now why would you say something like that?
Didn't think you cared about him anymore.

Just because you don't care about somebody
doesn't mean you wish them dead,

maybe you don't know the difference.
Luther just called his

on his way in with Nick.

His not dead after
all, guess we can eat?
