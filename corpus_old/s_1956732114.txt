â™ªâ™ª

Good afternoon, sir. 
Sergeant Tyler.

This is Christo's gang. 
I think you knew 
the victim, Sam Latham.

Three 18-year-old prostitutes
mutilated to send him
a message.

Here I got two prosecutors...

burned to death for refusing
to accept bribes, hmm.

Look at these pictures, 
Mr. Nile. Look at them.

Tell me you don't feel 
embarrassed to count 
Christo among your clients.

Now, we picked up 
a guy last night. 
We can't identify him.

But we believe 
he's Christo.

We have nothing 
to connect him 
to any crime.

There's no legal way 
we can hold him.

Mr. Nile, the word on the street is that you're laundering money for him.

You're the only person 
we know who can 
identify him.

Captain Tyler, my relationship with my clients...

is bound by strict confidentiality,

and if you think that I'm gonna break that confidentiality for you,

you can shove it up
your fuckin' ass!

Oh! Alex.

What's happening, 
baby?How are ya?

How are you,
my friend?

Good. Fine.

So?

So you can tell
your client it's done.

Good job, my friend.
 Good job.

Don't blow it all at once.Don't worry.
Well, I've gotta go.

Wait. I've gotta talk
to you. It's important.
Annette!

Give me two pastis, 
ma cherie.

I have a big client.
 I mean, serious.

A black guy.
He's called Mlambo.

He wants his accountant to testify against some motherfucker called Christo.

Last week, the cop picked up the cunt while busting some other fucker.

The money man has the evidence to get him banged up for life.

Mlambo wants you to protect this guy.

You go and you
take care of him.

How much?Fifty thousand dollars now,

and 150,000 when
he goes to court.

Good money.

Just one thing.

It's in Cape Town.

You're kidding.

You're fucking with me,
right?

Fuck, Alex, all right,
all right. That whole thing
was 30 years ago.

Thirty years.

Wanna sleep on it?

Yeah, but...
I can't promise anything.

I don't think it's a good idea for you to stay here in town...

until after the trial is over.

Christo will hit us
with everything he's got
when he finds out.

I love Cape Town. 
I'm not running like a rat.

For 30 years,

I only made one rule
for all my customers--

I never ask a question
 I didn't want the answer to.

I managed their cash.

No books, no paper trail.

All based on trust.

Christo does not belong
to my world.

You're right, Robert, but when show time happens,

none of our partners
are gonna back you on this.

As long as you understand
you'll be alone.

I sure do, my friend.

Robert, I'll be back in my office if you need me.

Give my best to Marge.

I'll double the security
around the outside.

That's a good idea.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Just so you know, 
I'm head of security 
for Mr. Nile.

I have no problem with that,
Mr. Farrel.

Now you get out of here.

I don't know why
you're here, Mr. Laney.

But dealing with Christo 
is something else, huh?

Something you Europeans 
wouldn't understand.

You know, the kaffirs say 
he's sangoma.

He just has to think 
about killing you 
and you're dead.

You don't know Africa, man.
We have different rules here.

He's a legend-- a ghost.

Up until a few days ago, the police weren't even sure he existed.

I'm Robert Nile.
Sir.

Come on.

According to some people,
you have a reputation.

While you're here, 
you run your job.

You make sure that I run mine.
I run the show.

Mr. Laney,
I don't believe you've
met my assistant, Helena.

Alex, is it?

Alex Laney, sir.

Hmm, Alex Laney.
Helena Taylor. What is it?

Hello, Mr. Laney.

She said no.

Get Farrel.
That'll be all, Mr. Laney.

Thank you, sir.

This is a family matter.
You stay in the car.

Here. Stop here.

Miss Nile, I'm Alex Laney.
I work for your father.

Pack up. We're leaving.
I'm not! Get out of my house!

Get the fuck out of here, 
otherwise I'll--

Come on. Let's go.

You're a sick man.Try to find a safe place.

What are you talking about?
Just do it. Trust me.

Your dad is waiting
for you.

This is for
your own good, darling.

Will someone explain to me
what this is all about?

Am I your prisoner
or something? Erika.

I've had to make some
very important decisions
about my life.

And about mine as well,
it seems.I want you to understand.

Bringing you here
was for your own safety,
not to invade your privacy.

I mean, we are in danger.
No, you are in danger.

You're my daughter.Since when?

Erika, don't make things so difficult.

I may not be a perfect father,
but I-- I believe
in my own way...

that I did my best
to raise you.

Sending your child to a boarding
school in Switzerland doesn't
make you a respectable man.

I don't want my life 
to look like yours.

Look who you've become 
and who you are.

You're an embarrassment.
 You're a crook.

Just go.

I'm sorry.

You're not even capable 
of sorry! Who the fuck 
do you think you are?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª We have to take Mr. Nile
 into the city tomorrow.

For his deposition
at the prosecutor's office.

He has to show up 
in person.

I've mapped a route
for you.

Study it.

What the fuck--

Let's go!

Come on! Let's go!
Move, move!

The judge called 
several times. He wants 
you to call him back.

I will.

Are you all right?

Obviously, I'm fine.
Mr. Laney.

A friend of mine wants to meet you.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Glad you could come,
Mr. Laney. I'm Gatsha.

Gatsha Mlambo.

Oh, I just love
this beautiful country.

You know, here we do have
a tradition of respect and
a long history of culture.

Suzy.

What happened today is totally
unacceptable. Robert is
a very valuable resource.

You are here
to protect him. Mr. Mlambo.

We were set up.I don't want to
hear about it.

You're here to
protect him from Christo.

South Africa doesn't play 
by any rules--

It's very horrible
how your parents
were killed.

Sad indeed how it
happened so suddenly.

The police never did 
find the killer, 
did they?

I've enjoyed
our little chat, Mr. Laney.

We'll have to do it 
again sometime.

Eat it!

Give me the remote.

What is this? They're feeding
the guy spaghetti?

Some stranger?
Then they beat him to death.

Come on.
Christo's lost it.

Do I know this guy?
Why should I give a fuck?

Those son of a bitches
think this is gonna
scare me?

You didn't know him, sir.

He was Erika's boyfriend.

No, I--

I didn't know.

â™ª Hey, Mr. Sandman

â™ª Send me a dream

â™ª Someone to lean on

â™ª Someone to squeeze

â™ª And we'll be  perfect strangers â™ª

â™ª We could be holy fools

â™ª In the morning light

â™ª In the morning light â™ª

Oh, my God!

You killed him!
 You killed him!

You killed him!

You killed him!

Sir, where we going?

Just fuckin' drive.

â™ªâ™ª

Give us a couple
of Jack Daniels.

How do you, uh,
like drinking, Mr. Laney?

Or are you one of those guys
that don't drink, don't smoke
and don't fuck?

I drink once in a while, sir.

You saved my life
in the alley the other day.

That's something
a man like myself...

doesn't forget.

It's awkward,
your job.

Protecting a guy 
like me...

for money.

It's kind of like
those girls.

I'd like to think 
I provide a different 
type of service, sir.

Good.

Tonight I'm gonna
relax a little bit.

Have a few drinks.

And, uh, have a little fun.

And you just, uh, 
watch over me.

Ladies, over here.

Here.

You care to have
a drink with me?

â™ª It doesn't mean I didn't try â™ª

â™ª I just never know why

â™ª Is it 'cause I'm all alone

â™ª Baby, you're not at home

â™ª And when I'm old

â™ª Make me feel  I'm still alone â™ª

â™ª Being so restless I am

â™ª Beat my head against the wall â™ª

â™ª Try to knock some sense All right!

â™ª Down in my bones

â™ª And even though they don't show â™ª

â™ª The scars aren't so old I know where I'm at. I know where I'm at.

Just keep driving. Keep driving.

â™ª And when they go

â™ª They let you know

â™ª You can't put your arms  around a memory â™ª

â™ª You can't put your arms  around a memory â™ª

â™ª You can't put your arms  around a memory â™ªI know where we're at.

â™ª Don't try â™ªRelax, relax.

Yeah, there it is.
All right, right over here.

Hey, hey, that's good. Hey.

Hey, hey.

Hey, who is this?My wife.

Are you happy, huh? Melanie, are you happy now?

What do you say?

Hmm? Hmm?

That's what you always
wanted, huh?

Me being chased
like a fuckin' rat.

Your daughter--

she thinks I'm
the worst piece of shit.

So I guess you won, huh?

Yeah.

And I'll tell you.

Promise you...

I'll ask your opinion
about whatever I do
from now on.

Starting tonight.

Which one of these two--
of these two girls,
which one should I fuck, hmm?

Shall I fuck the blonde?

Fuck the brunette?

Oh, fuck!

I can't--
 I can't hear you.

I can't even fuckin' hear you.

Just go.

Sir?

Hear you.
We should go now.

I know. I know.

Mr. Laney, thank you.

You're a good boy.

Oh, God!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Oh, man.

You got a family,
Mr. Laney?

My parents died
when I was a kid.

Yeah, my mother
abandoned me.

Split when I was seven.

God bless her.

My father--

Fuck, I didn't even know
who he was.

I can't stand to see--

see my daughter crying.

I've never been able
to talk to her.

Her mother--

Her mother was
a great woman.

Hello?

Sir, it's Farrel.

Who?Farrel.

Yeah?

Where?

We'll be right there.

They've got Erika.

Your daddy's on his way.

Why are you doing this?

I'm gonna make a trade--
you for your father.

'Cause Christo,
he pays more.

And he's a mad bastard.

Did you see what
they did to your boyfriend?

A shame, huh?

Gag the bitch.

â™ª I've walked the house of New Orleans â™ª

â™ª They call the Rising Sun

â™ª And it's been the ruin

â™ª Of many boys and girls

â™ª And me, sweet Lord  I'm one â™ª

â™ª My mother was a tailor

â™ª She sewed  my new blue jeans â™ª

This is Africa, I told you.

African rules.

Where is she?

Where is she?

She's over there.

Drop the guns. Go.

Come on.

You okay?

â™ª I'm goin' back

â™ª To wear that  ball and chain â™ª

On the ground.
 On the ground!

â™ª Oh, Mother  Tell your children â™ª

Let's go.

â™ª Not to do what  I have done â™ª

Go.

â™ª Don't you spend  your life â™ª

â™ª In sin and misery

â™ª In the house  of the Rising â™ªâ™ª

Sweetheart, it's okay.

Stop! Stop! Here!
Turn in.

Let's get rid
of this car.

It's locked.

Come on, come on.
Here we go.

Okay.

Let's go. Let's go!

You could go around.

Thank you very much
for bringing him back.

Pleasure, Mama.

I proposed to her mother here
35 years ago.Mom came here?

I brought her here once.Well, she
must've loved it.

She did.
 She loved it here.

I can feel her
here with us now.

That's sweet.

Robert, my boy,
why are you always wearing
that dangerous thing?

Well, Mother,
it's just decoration.

I mean, Alex is the one
that's gonna take care of me.

Oh, I hope.
Think of it as decoration.

That's good. So good.
So good.

What a day, huh?

Thank you, sir.

Yes, sir, I know. 
All right, sir. 
I'll do it myself.

Thank you, sir.

We have to let him go.

Christo.

What's the game?

Five low, split the fives.Yeah. All right.

So?Oh, I check.

Come on, Dad.
You're not gonna smoke.

All right.

Okay, king, nine checks. Sir, can we--

I'm getting too old
for this stuff.

All right.
I'm gonna go to bed.Good night, Dad.

Going to bed.

Sir? Sir? Sir?

I can't believe your father
took the fucking joint.

Mr. Goat, do I know you?

I'm Robert Nile.

Do you know that your ancestors
took psychedelics?

Erika, your father
is talking to a goat.

What?

Then they drank their urine
for the psychedelic properties.

You're like a brother to me.
Do you know that?

I was weaned 
on goat's milk.

My mother split. You know
what I'm saying to you?

You think my daughter
loves me?

'Cause I love my daughter.

Hmm?

I'm Robert Nile.
 I'm a very powerful, rich man.

And I got nothing.

Yeah, I fucked up, man.

I fucked up.

Anyway, you tell your mother...

that Robert Nile's back in town,
all right?

I wanna straighten things out.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

â™ªâ™ª

That was beautiful.

Thank you.

I think I better go too.

Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

â™ªâ™ª

Good night.

â™ªâ™ª

Christo, please. It's not my fault that they escaped.

Understand.

Things didn't go the way you wanted them, Christo.

Please.

Christo.

Christo, no. Please.

Please.

Christo, no! No, Christo!

That's Tyler.
Christo's been released.

I can't go back to Cape Town...
for the deposition.

So he's sending
an assistant out here...

and he'll meet us
at the end of the road.

The three of us will go.

No. Can't.

Christo.

Now?Why are you stopping?

I thought you knew
the place.No.

I thought you knew the place,
so why are we stopping here?

Everybody out!
Come on! Come on out!
To the caves!

Everybody,
to the caves!

Everybody!
 Everybody out!

Out! Come on! This way!
 Out! Let's go!

Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Hurry, hurry!

There's danger! Hurry! Hurry!

I'm going to take the people
up to the caves.

I'm staying, sir.
 I'm staying.

Be safe.

Hello?

Christo!

Thank you, sir.

â™ªâ™ª

Alex, I did something terrible.

A long time ago.

A contract Mlambo got me into.

It's something that's bothered me my entire life.

I came to this house.

I can hear it like it was yesterday.

There was a woman playing the piano.

It was beautiful.

Then I pulled out my gun
and I-- I killed 'em.

Her and her husband.

A reporter. Pissed off some politician.

I remember his face,

her screams, the blood.

But the worst thing,

the thing that's haunted me all these years,

was the eyes of the kid--

their kid-- looking up at me...

murdering his father...

after I'd killed his mother.

I never forgot your eyes, my son.

I killed your parents.

I'd die right now
if I could go back
and make things right.

I've given this some thought.

You can take my life
right now...

and make it right.

â™ªâ™ª
