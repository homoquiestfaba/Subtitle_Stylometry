He told me,
"I'll steal a part of you."

He told me,
"I'll steal a part of you."

Here is your inside
to meet the outer world.

Past and future,
end or beginning,

have become the same.

I'm not afraid of you,

I'm not afraid to remember.

There are places
you cannot hide.

Curving back
within myself I create,

again and again.

Breaths of every subtle essence.

All heavenly odors,

shedding blinding brilliance.

Overspreading, boundless,

beautiful, all spaces.

â™ª Run from the light

â™ª Your eyes
black like an animal â™ª

â™ª Deep in the wander

â™ª And care for no one

â™ª But the offspring
of your might â™ª

â™ª Run from the one

â™ª Who comes to find you

â™ª Wait for the night
that comes to hide â™ª

â™ª Your eyes
black like an animal â™ª

â™ª Black like an animal

â™ª Crossing the water

â™ª Lead them to die

â™ª We press for the water

â™ª Press for the river

â™ª Press for the rain

â™ª We press for the water

â™ª Press for the river

â™ª Press for the pain

â™ª We press for the water

â™ª We press for the water

â™ª We press for the water

â™ª We press for the water

Woman:
I'm not afraid of you,

I'm not afraid to remember.

There are places
you cannot hide.

The splendor of the earth
licking like tongues.

Unformed, transformed,
and familiar.

A knowledge
of the world in patterns.

A heart full of ancient anger.

I'm not afraid of you,

I'm not afraid to remember.

There are places
you cannot hide.

â™ª You put the pill
inside the petal â™ª

â™ª You put the petal
in your mouth â™ª

â™ª You put your love
inside the metal â™ª

â™ª You build the metal
for your house â™ª

â™ª And the night runs wild

â™ª You put the pill
inside the petal â™ª

â™ª And it runs white

â™ª You put the petal
in your mouth â™ª

â™ª You put your blood
into the metal â™ª

â™ª And it runs white

â™ª You build the metal
for your house â™ª

â™ª You put the pill
inside the metal â™ª

â™ª You put the metal
in your mouth â™ª

â™ª You bleed into
your house of nettles â™ª

â™ª You bleed the night
without a sound â™ª

â™ª There's an ocean

â™ª Inside your chest

â™ª We've been sleeping

â™ª Inside your head

â™ª There's an ocean

â™ª Inside your chest

â™ª We've been sleeping

â™ª Inside your head

I'll kill a part of you.

Here is your inside,

to meet the outer world.

I'm not afraid of you,

I'm not afraid to remember.

There are places
you cannot hide.

Now I am become death,

destroyer of worlds.

Now I am become death,

destroyer of worlds.

Now I am become death,

destroyer of worlds.

The eclipse
that caused a tidal wave.

Memory is temporary, as life.

The water is the womb
where all memory began.

Taken form in wonder.

Finality, peace through anger.

Cause and effect
and endless regret,

cornered by
a desire to remember.

Freedom in life,
freedom in love.

Freedom in nature,
freedom in death.

â™ª The pain forms

â™ª A circle

â™ª With a light

â™ª At the center

â™ª I can see it from here,
the end is coming â™ª

â™ª And all the wait

â™ª It was for nothing

â™ª I covered you

â™ª In royal jelly

â™ª I made you queen

â™ª And you forgave me

â™ª We'll be given the world

â™ª In the right time

â™ª But we made our own

â™ª And left it empty

â™ª This will be ours

â™ª Because we're the concept

â™ª And we're the flawed

â™ª And we're the answer

â™ª You said to me

â™ª It won't be long now

â™ª You'll leave the world

â™ª And you will join me here

â™ª My flesh is afraid
but I am not â™ª

â™ª Cause love now is
only the pain of needing â™ª

â™ª They took your smell

â™ª They took your shadow

â™ª And I'm searching
through faces â™ª

â™ª For someone familiar

â™ª I clawed and I clawed

â™ª But I couldn't
find you there â™ª

â™ª You wouldn't wake

â™ª I couldn't sleep for years

â™ª This will be ours

â™ª Because we're the concept

â™ª And we're the flawed

â™ª And we're the answer

â™ª And we're the stars

â™ª It won't be long now

â™ª It will be ours

â™ª It will be ours

â™ª Because we are the flawed

â™ª And we're the stars

â™ª And we are the flawed

â™ª We are flawed

â™ª Creation was the only word â™ª

â™ª That made you
feel you never were â™ª

â™ª An endless hope
is all it was â™ª

â™ª And holding sacred all were â™ª

â™ª And don't forsake
the way we were â™ª

â™ª And don't tell me
you never would â™ª

â™ª And we don't need
physical things â™ª

â™ª To make us feel
and make us dream â™ª

â™ª When earth cracks open
and swallows then â™ª

â™ª We'll never be tired again

â™ª And we'll be
given everything â™ª

â™ª The moment we realize
we're not in control â™ª

â™ª Never to return to me

â™ª Never to return to me

â™ª Never to return

â™ª To me

He told me,
"I'll steal a part of you."

Here is your inside
to meet the outer world.

Past and future,

end or beginning
have become the same.

Here are my insides
to meet the outer world.

â™ª This suffering

â™ª Brings me closer

â™ª To you

â™ª And time is broken

â™ª And moves slow

â™ª Your pure heart

â™ª Your white light

â™ª I should be put to death

â™ª For ever being cruel to you

â™ª You washed me clean
like no one ever could â™ª

â™ª Come closer now

â™ª And step right into

â™ª The wide mouth

â™ª The sharp teeth
of the one you love â™ª

â™ª The wide mouth

â™ª The sharp teeth
of the one you love â™ª

â™ª The wide mouth

â™ª The sharp teeth
of the one you love â™ª

â™ª I'm not the kind
of sick that you can fix â™ª

â™ª Don't you worry
about me baby â™ª

â™ª I've got no enemies
and I've got no time â™ª

When your blood races,
my blood races.

When your blood races,
my blood races.

â™ª The song

â™ª We carry on

â™ª Even though
you pushed us down â™ª

â™ª We carry on

â™ª When you try
to blind my eyes â™ª

â™ª I can see tenfold

â™ª It's nothing
that my heart can't take â™ª

â™ª Because your hate
has made me strong â™ª

â™ª And stronger men
than you have tried â™ª

â™ª To break me

â™ª Stronger men
than you have tried â™ª

â™ª To break me

â™ª Leaning toward
the golden days â™ª

â™ª Forget about the older days

â™ª And everything
we left behind â™ª

â™ª To stand here
in another life â™ª

â™ª We carry on

â™ª Even though you held us down â™ª

â™ª We carry on

â™ª With the song

â™ª We carry on

â™ª Even though
you pushed us down â™ª

â™ª We carry on

â™ª We carry on

â™ª We carry on

â™ª We carry on

â™ª We carry on

â™ª We carry on

â™ª When the wind

â™ª Takes 'em all

â™ª Away from here

â™ª Away from me

â™ª When the sorrow

â™ª Is all gone

â™ª It is buried

â™ª In the soil

â™ª When the wind

â™ª Takes 'em all

â™ª Away from here

â™ª Away from me

â™ª When the sorrow

â™ª Is all gone

â™ª It is buried

â™ª In the sun

â™ª When the wolves

â™ª Howl their song

â™ª And the whole

â™ª Earth is done

â™ª When the wolves

â™ª Howl their song

â™ª And the wind

â™ª Still carries on
