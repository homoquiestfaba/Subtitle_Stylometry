AN ACTOR'S LIFE IS
A TOUGH ROW TO HOE.

UH, COME ON, KENNETH,

I CAN TELL
WHEN I'M NOT WANTED.

TA-TA, KIDDIES.

DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

I WONDER ?

DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM.

THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT

ON THE BEACH.

OH, SHIT.  I GOTTA GO.

HEY, PELICAN, I'M LEAVING !

A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS

OR SIT HERE AND TALK TO ME
OR BOTH OR WHATEVER.

WELL, I SHOULD CLEAN MY SHIRT.

OH, YEAH.
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

I COULD THROW IT IN
WITH MY STUFF
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

WANT SOME COFFEE ?

NO, THANKS.
OKAY.

I SAW YOU AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT.

OH, YEAH ?

WELL, A GIRL'S GOT A RIGHT
TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA 
SPENDIN' MONEY, HUH ?

I MEAN, A BUNCH OF OLD PIGS
WANT TO THROW ME SOME OF 
THEIR POCKET CHANGE.

WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.
I MEAN.

YEAH, I GUESS.

SO, WHAT BRINGS
A STRANGER LIKE YOU
DOWN HERE...

TO THE END OF
THE CHARTERED EARTH ?

WELL, I USED TO LIVE...
IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY.

I JUST GOT SICK OF THE COLD,
THAT'S ALL.

YEAH ?

WHAT, YOU JUST WANDER AROUND
WHERE THE CLIMATE SUITS 
YOUR CLOTHES ?

SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

AND YOU,
ARE YOU FROM HERE ?

NO, HARDLY.

NO, I MOVED DOWN HERE
A FEW YEARS BACK.

THIS FRIEND OF MINE, MARCY,

WE JUST SORT OF STAYED 
DOWN HERE TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE.

IT'S A NICE PLACE.
FOR A WHILE.

YEAH.  YEAH, IT IS.
IT IS.

CLAUDINE.
HEY.  HOW YOU DOIN' ?

THAT'S NICE.

THAT'S NICE.

I GOT ONE HERE.

YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER PALMER
USED TO HAVE THIS REALLY 
GREAT TATTOO ON HIS ARM.

THIS ROSE.
THIS BLACK ROSE.

A ROSE AS BLACK AS DEATH.

WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS TATTOO ?
IT FELL OFF ?

FELL OFF ?  NO, NO,
IT DIDN'T FALL OFF.

NO, MY BROTHER SHOT HIMSELF
ON HIS 16th BIRTHDAY.

HE WAS IN THIS...
UPSTAIRS ROOM...

THAT SORT OF SERVED AS THIS 
EXTENDED PARLOR ROOM,
YOU KNOW.

MY FATHER AND MY STEPMOTHER 
WERE THERE.

ANYWAY, THE NEXT DAY,
I PACKED MY STUFF,

AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
BACK THERE SINCE.

I'M SORRY.

I'M NOT.

I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE ANYMORE,

UNLESS I'M STARING
RIGHT DOWN AT HIS PICTURE.

YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS 
SCIENCE TEACHER ONCE...

WHEN I WAS BACK
IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

I SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR
IGNORING THE MAN,

EXCEPT THERE WAS ONE THING
THAT HE SAID THAT I WILL
ALWAYS, ALWAYS REMEMBER.

HE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAW.

YOU KNOW,
THIS LAW THAT GOVERNED
THE WHOLE WIDE UNIVERSE.

THE WAY IT WORKED IS THAT...
ALL THINGS THAT MATTER
WOULD BE RETURNED.

YOU KNOW, THAT MATTER ITSELF
ISN'T CREATED OR DESTROYED.

IT JUST LASTS FOREVER.

WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THEM
ANYMORE, BUT THEY COME BACK.

SHOWS WHAT I LEARNED
IN SCHOOL, HUH ?

CLAUDINE !  CLAUDINE !

TAKIN' A TRIP ?

YEAH.

THERE'S BEEN
A BIT OF AN ERROR, STEFANO.

BIT OF A...
MISCALCULATION.

WHAT SORT OF
MISCALCULATION ?

I'M PREGNANT.

PREGNANT ?

OFFICIALLY SO.

WHAT ARE WE

WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM GONNA DO

WHO IS THIS FRIEND ?

I'M GONNA GO SEE MARCY.

I JUST NEED TO GET
MY HEAD TOGETHER.

I CAN'T EVEN THINK ANYMORE.

YOU'RE GOING TO GO

WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR ?

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ?

I HAD THIS BOW AND ARROW...

MY BROTHER BOUGHT FOR ME
FOR MY NINTH BIRTHDAY,

AND I USED TO MAKE MARCY
COME OUT ON THE ROOF WITH ME...

AND I WOULD SHOOT
TARGET PRACTICE.

I KILLED A PIGEON ONCE.

I NAILED HIM.

SHE DIDN'T TALK TO ME
FOR A WEEK.

SEE THAT BRICK BUILDING ?
OVER THERE.

MM-HMM.

HERE WE ARE.

I'M SO NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

SHE HAS VANISHED.

COULD YOU HOLD THIS FOR US ?

WHERE THE HELL IS MARCY ?

I JUST TOLD YOU, STEFANO.

SHE'S GONE, OKAY ?

SHE'S GONE AWAY 
WITH SOMEONE.

SOME FAT PIG OF A MAN.

GET IT ?

WE'RE GOIN' DOWNSTAIRS.

THIS USED TO BE MY OLD ROOM.

WHERE ?  HERE ?
YEAH.

IT STICKS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?

WE'RE GONNA GO IN HERE 
FOR A WHILE, OKAY ?

THERE'S A COUCH DOWN THERE
IF YOU WANNA LIE DOWN.

HEY.  GOOD MORNIN'.

WHERE IS, UH.

OH, WHAT ?
THE LITTLE FRAULEIN ?

SHE LEFT SHORTLY AFTER
I BEGAN THROWIN' UP.

CLAUDINE.
HEY, CHERRIE.

I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
BE VERY HAPPY FOR MARCY, CLAUDINE.

WELL, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR HER.

WHEN SHE CAME BACK
AFTER YOU BETRAYED HER.

I THINK THAT'S RATHER
SIMPLIFYING THINGS, CHERRIE.

IT WAS JUST AWFUL.
SHE WOULDN'T EAT A THING
FOR WEEKS.

I HAD TO FEED HER
WITH A SPOON.

YEAH, WELL, THEN I'M GLAD
SHE'S WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T
SO UTTERLY HEARTLESS.

THE MAN SHE'S WITH,
HE'S FROM BRAZIL.

HE'S DEPENDABLE,
BOTH EMOTIONALLY
AND FINANCIALLY STABLE.

YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES
DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

HERE'S YOUR BOWL
OF DRY CEREAL.

HEY.

HEY, PEOPLE LEAVE
OTHER PEOPLE, OKAY ?

THAT'S LIFE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR
PHILOSOPHICAL CONTRIBUTION,
STEFANO.

SHIT !

LEAVE IT ALONE.

COME ON, LEAVE IT ALONE.
NO, YOU LEAVE IT ALONE !

YOU FUCKIN' LEAVE ME
ALONE !

WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE,
PLEASE ?

NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.
COME HERE.

LOOK, IT HAS BEEN REALLY,
REALLY NICE KNOWING EACH OTHER.

ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME ?

I JUST THINK THAT IT'S BEST...

IF WE BOTH GO
OUR OWN SEPARATE WAYS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

WAIT A MINUTE.
OH, I GET IT.

YOU THINK THAT I HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

OH!  OH, NO!

OH, WHAT, YOU THINK
I NEEDED YOU
TO TOUCH ME, HUH ?

YOU THINK I NEEDED
YOUR BIG, STRONG, HANDSOME
ITALIAN HANDS ALL OVER ME ?

MAKE LOVE TO ME, STEFANO.

MAKE LOVE TO ME NOW !

OH, THAT IS SO FUCKIN' SAD.

I'M SO SORRY.

AND I HOPE YOU KNOW
THAT YOU WERE NOT HERE...

FOR ANY OTHER REASON 
THAN TO DRIVE.

OR THAT AND THE OCCASIONAL
ADEQUATE...

TOSS IN THE HAY, HUH ?

I TRY NOT TO THINK
WHY YOU DO ANYTHING,
CLAUDINE.

THIS IS STUPID.

IF YOU'RE TOO FUCKIN'
COWARDLY TO LEAVE,
I GUESS I HAVE TO !

HEY !
I'M SORRY.  I'M SORRY.

CHEERS.

HEY !  SHE WENT THAT WAY.

HEY.

I'M SORRY.

I'M SORRY.

HEY.

GOT YOU SOME THINGS.

THIS IS FOR YOUR HEAD.

AND THIS, THE LADY
AT THE PHARMACY
GAVE IT TO ME...

AND SAID IT'S GOOD
FOR YOUR MORNING SICKNESS.

IT HURTS ?

ARE YOU HUNGRY ?

GIVE ME THIS.

WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING 
LIPSTICK ON FOR HERE ?

YOU GIRLS AND YOUR MAKEUP.

DO YOU LIKE ME ?

COME ON.

DID YOU EVER...

DID YOU EVER FALL IN LOVE
WITH A MAN BEFORE ?

I MEAN, I KNOW WITH A GIRL.

BUT WITH A MAN ?

I WAS IN LOVE
WITH A BOY ONCE.

A BOY ?

WHAT HAPPENED ?

IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
 STEFANO.

WE WERE JUST KIDS.

WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

ANYWAY, I LET THAT
GO BEHIND ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

HEY.

ALL RIGHT. 
YOU CAN RELAX NOW.

IT'S A PERFECTLY 
NATURAL OCCURRENCE.

YOU, UH, MAY NOT KNOW THIS,

BUT ONE IN EVERY TWO PREGNANCIES
ENDS IN A MISCARRIAGE.

THE IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU
TO REMEMBER...

IS THAT YOU'RE YOUNG,
HEALTHY, AND YOU'RE STRONG.

GIVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE TIME,

THERE'S NO REASON
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO MAKE SOME YOUNG MAN...

A VERY HAPPY DADDY.

"VAN DOOZEN," HUH ?

YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
FROM THE CHARLESTON AREA,
WOULD YA ?

YEAH.

MINNOW BAY ?

YEAH.

ARE YOU RELATED TO
CLAUDE VAN DOOZEN, 
OLD ADMIRAL CLAUDE ?

YEAH.  THAT'S MY FATHER.

NO KIDDING.

WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

MY BROTHER WENT TO
OFFICER TRAINING
WITH OLD CLAUDE.

UH, OR KICK-ASS CLAUDE
AS THEY USED TO CALL HIM.

SO HOW'S THE OLD MAN DOING
THESE DAYS ?

STILL MEAN AS EVER,
I SUPPOSE.

UH, I WOULDN'T KNOW.

I GUESS WE BETTER BE
HEADING BACK.

ARE YOU OKAY FOR THE CAR ?

YEAH, I'M FINE.

YOU KNOW, STEFANO,
I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT...

I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALREADY
PRACTICALLY HERE AND EVERYTHING,

YOU KNOW,
SO CLOSE TO CHARLESTON,
I WAS THINKING MAYBE I COULD,

I COULD DRIVE UP THERE
TO THE OLD FAMILY HOUSE...

AND SPEND THE NIGHT...

AND COME BACK TOMORROW.

OKAY.  LET'S GO.

NO.  I WANNA GO BY MYSELF
THIS TIME,

IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU.

I'M NOT GONNA TAKE VERY LONG.
I JUST WANNA GO UP THERE AND,

YOU KNOW,
SPEND THE NIGHT,
AND... I'LL COME BACK.

BACK TO THE ISLAND ?

TO THE ISLAND.

TO YOU.

TOMORROW, OKAY ?

SEE YOU TOMORROW,
OR YOU'RE FIRED.

HEY !

I CAN TAKE YOUR BAG
FOR YOU.

HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

SORRY.  CAN I GET MY BAG ?

AT WHAT TIME DOES THIS BUS LEAVES ?
UH, THIS BUS IS LEAVING AT 3:45.

CAN I GET A TICKET HERE ?
NO, SIR, YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE MAIN BUS STATION.

THAT'S FOR CHARLESTON, RIGHT ?
YES, SIR.

'SCUSE ME.  
SORRY I HAVE A MISTAKEN TICKET...

AND I WANT TO CHANGE IT
FOR CHARLESTON.

SON, I THINK
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO
THE BACK OF THE LINE.

LOOK, I HAVE
THREE MINUTES LEFT.
THE BUS IS LEAVING.

SORRY.  CAN'T DO THAT.

MA'AM,
HERE ARE YOUR TICKETS.

MISS CLAUDINE.

BEEN A LONG TIME, HUH ?

WHY, YOU...

WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

I CAME TO SEE PALMER.

WILL YOU SHOW ME
WHERE HE IS ?

IF YOU WANNA HAVE A SEAT,
WE'LL GET MOVIN'.

NOT VERY BIG, IS IT ?

THE FUNERAL WAS REAL NICE.

THE FUNERAL WAS...
REALLY, REALLY NICE.

YOUR STEPMOM IS INSIDE.

I KNOW.

'SCUSE ME, SIR,
CAN I HELP YOU ?

SIR, CAN I HELP YOU ?

YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE
RIGHT NOW, SIR.
I'M SORRY !

LET ME SEE HER !

I WANNA BE HERE !

CHLOE, 
YOU WANNA COME IN WITH DADDY?  
ALL RIGHT.

HONEY, 
I WANNA GET SOME MINERAL WATER.

SWEETIE, YOU WANT ANYTHING ?

KEEP THE DOORS LOCKED.

NUMBER ONE, PLEASE.
