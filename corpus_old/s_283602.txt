Oh, what a time for a song

A song for a new beginning

We start into our lives with a new melody

We turn to the river of eternity

Oh, what a day for a walk!

Along the sunlit pathways

We hold each other's hands
with a soft tender look

We radiate our love with a simple smile

It's a new beginning,
it's a brand new start

We're born again to be someone else...

From this moment on we'll be one

We'll be one in two,

...we'll be two in one

And we'll make through our lives
hand in hand

Oh, what a moment to rejoice

For our yearning future

All our roots treasured within our dreams

All our dreams on their way to success

It's a new beginning,
it's a brand new start

And we're born again to be someone else

From this moment on, we'll be one...

We'll be one in two, we'll be two in one

We'll make through our lives hand in hand

The car's broken?

Call the mechanic

l can fix it myself

Prepared for the London University
entry-exam?

No

Then how can you study abroad?

Step on the gas please, dad

Right on

You want to go for a spin?

Ask me like you mean it

l know... don't drive too fast

You're home?

Bye

Dad

Go upstairs

Cindy

Where did you go?

We were practising... singing

How many times have l told you?

Why don't you listen?

Never mind, she's good at school

She loves singing

Shut up, you've spoilt her

That's why she won't listen

Do you know what her friends are like?

The boys are wearing ridiculous clothes

The girls in the shortest pants

l bumped into them once

There was a girl
whose mid-riff totally showed

If she hangs around with them,
she will...

Give that to me

Come on

Don't ruin my guitar

l bought it with my own money

Give it to me. You can't sing anymore

No, l love to sing

Well, l don't want you to

Daddy, but l do

Cindy, you're my daughter

Give it to me

Don't make your dad angry

You are daddy's baby girl

No, l'm not anyone's baby

l'd rather you hate me now...

than to blame me in the future

Cindy

Cindy, what? The guitar's broken?

We can buy another one

Don't cry

Who are you?

L'm Ling Xi. You must be Cindy's dad

Come, let's go for a drive in my new car

l don't want to go out today

Because of the guitar?

Don't worry, on your 16th birthday...

l'll buy you a new one

Let's go

This is Ling Xi

It doesn't matter who he is,
they're all the same

No, he's different, dad

Get out

Dad

Mr. Xin, l'm Cindy's friend

If she's unhappy...

it'd be better if l talk to her

She tells me everything

If she wants to talk...

she can talk to her own parents;

But certainly not you

You'll need a new one

Do you want me to get a saw?

Then we must talk like this

Look at my car. L fixed it, you know

It's ugly

Beg your pardon?

It can almost fly

Ling Xi, those two who just walked past;

Do you think their heart
will cry out for...

Romeo and Juliet?

Most definitely

But l think if they were
the parents of Juliet...

they would have forced her to death

Great. You look best when you smile

We're grown-ups, aren't we?

L am, of course

At the same time, you ain't a child either

Don't be sad, l'll buy you a new guitar

You can practise at my place

l'll listen with my heart

Go now, l'll see you later

Bye

Hey!

It seems that...

we can only see each other
in front of the garage

You like to work with machines

You should've opted for
mechanical engineering

Just like your elder brother, get a Ph.D.

Dad

Not everyone ought to get a doctorate

l mean, Mankind has existed for
such a long time

And how long have
the Ph.D. Programs been around?

You bear such extremist views!

L don't care for the others

But you're my own son

Ling Xi

Dad, l want to...

l don't wish to further my studies

No second thoughts?

You'll regret this

Maybe

No one knows whether
they've made the right decision

There are so many paths
in the course of life, dad

In the future...

You will know that
those paths are all dead-ends

But l want to try anyway

l'm going to see Cindy today

Cindy's dad held my shoulder like this

...and kicked me out

Cindy is my girlfriend

How old is she? What does her father do?

It's so strange

That's the typical reaction of folks
at your age

As soon as you know
your son has a girlfriend

...you've got nothing else to ask

Why don't you ask me...

how important she is to me?

What her dad does...

is it that important?

Fine, tell me then

How important is she to you?

She is THE most important

Then come my cars

What about me?

What kind of question is that?

You know, only girls...

would ask such a question

All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

l can't sleep through the night time

And l weep when dawn arrives

All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

The seasons spinning round again

The years keep rolling by

l guess l've been here before

l can't remember when

But l've got this funny feeling

That l'll be there once again

There's no straight lines that
make up my life

And all my roads have bends

There's no clear cut beginnings,

and so far no dead ends

All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

l can't sleep through the night time

And l weep when dawn arrives

All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

The seasons spinning round again

The years keep rolling by

l've found you a thousand times,

l guess you've done the same

But then we'll lose each other

It's just like a children's games

As l see you here again,

the thought runs through my mind

Our love is like a circle,

Let's go round one more time

All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

l can't sleep through the night time

And l weep when dawn arrives

All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

The seasons spinning round again

The years keep rolling by

All my life's a circle,
sunrise and sundown

l can't sleep through the night time

And l weep when dawn arrives

All my life's a circle,
but l can't tell you why

The seasons spinning round again

The years keep rolling by

Let's sing a joyful song, and be happy

Great...

l have a never ending love for you

From now on that's all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

l have a never ending love for you

From now on that all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

After all this time of being alone

We can love one another
live for each other

From now on...

Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you

From now on that's all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

After all this time of being alone

We can love one another live
for each other

From now on...

Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you

From now on that all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

l have a never ending love for you

From now on that's all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending song
of love for you

Your singing has improved a lot

So, any news
about the record company's contract?

L'm still under-age

Without my parents' signature,
l can't do a thing

Why don't you kiss me?

It's better to be a rock

Then l don't have to go home

Ling Xi, l must continue to sing

Can you help me?

But your dad doesn't approve

l can speak to your dad about you

l'd rather speak to a rock

Well, one must try

Don't worry. We'll definitely try

Come on

Don't bite your nails

Cindy's a talented singer

If she gets a chance to cut a record...

l'm sure she'll succeed

Please let her sign
with the record company

Sure

You can take her there right away

Me? But you are her dad

That's right

You know that l'm her dad

Let me remind you:

She's still under age

If you try anything with her,
you might go to jail

Uncle, l'd appreciate some respect

Respect? For a loser like you?

Now on, you'd do well
to stay away from him

Anything else you've got to say?

Yes

Dad, you are so mean

Don't cry, Cindy

What's going on?

Please don't interfere

Cindy

What should l do now, Ling Xi?

You'll leave now,
or should l call the police?

L'll leave now

Don't go, Ling Xi

You can take her with you

Dad, don't force me

l'm forcing you?

If you think he's more important than
your parents...

then you can go with him

Why must l choose?

Because it concerns your whole life

Yes, that's right

Cindy

Please forgive me

l must go now

You...

You won't see me again?

How can that be?

Absolutely not

Why not?

She isn't happy at home

Why can't she move here?

If the world ran like you think it does...

everything will be so simple, huh

But that's the truth

People like you complicate things

A person has got to be happy

If not, then one should be able to choose

Humans live in groups

There are many interactions between them

Don't you think all that is important?

It seems that...

we have different point-of-views
on everything

This is tragic, dad

It isn't... it's all your illusion,
l'd say

Naive, and simple

Thanks for telling me

Ling Xi

If you insist

Go ahead

But l won't support you

You should know what l mean

Of course

You should know that...

l despise those,

who are all-talk-but-no-deed

Yes. At least we have one thing in common

l hope you don't really mean it

l hope so too

l'll introduce Cindy to you

You will like her

It doesn't matter
whether l like her or not

The society isn't that simple

You're not independent... she's under-age

She'll be an obstacle in your future

You could be quite a man

You could be...

Enough

l don't value materialism
and reputation like you do

And l've raised you
because l have those values

That's your business

Ling Xi, l could tell that
you weren't happy

You're much better now

Me too

Someone's at front

Let's take a look

Let's go

Oh no, look what we've done

We've disturbed them

Right, we should have just sneaked up

You're blocking the way, pal.
L want to reverse

When wooing chicks
you must always go forward

That's right

There's a cliff up ahead

Go on

If you've got guts

Move over, l'm making a reverse

Sure

Maybe this lady will give us a good time

He doesn't want to let her go

What was that?

Go

Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Go

Hurry

Hurry

What's the matter with him?

Move over

Hurry

Start the engine

Bye

Uncle!

L know l ain't looking too good, but...

What happened?

L was in a fight

You shouldn't

Our daughter's grown up,
you can't beat her up

It's a father's fault
not to teach properly

If l don't teach her a lesson now...

it will be too late when she's pregnant

She knows what she's doing

If she does...

then she wouldn't hang out with him

Did you see him? All swollen?

L can't let Cindy see him anymore

Cindy isn't happy at home

l'm afraid if she might run away

Really? If she chooses...

to leave her parents, fine

l'll pretend that l don't have a daughter

Master, there's a young girl here for you

Your father is with her...

You look pale

Ling Xi, l...

l've got to leave for the office

Ling Xi, l know what happened

...to Cindy

Remember, l stand firm on my decision

...we spoke about last night

Ling Xi, l got out, do you understand?

L left the house

l understand. So you're not going back?

L want to be with you

Are you sure?

Yes. L can sing in the bars

And with the money l earn,
that will sustain us

What are you talking about?

L don't need you to support me

l have a never ending love for you

From now on that all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

l have a never ending love for you

From now on that all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

After all this time of being alone

We can love one another
live for each other

From now on...

Feels it's so good l can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you

From now on that all l wanna do

From the first time we met l knew

l have this never ending love for you

Mr. Ling, are you kidding?

No, boss. L'm serious

You've always said that
l'm a first-class technician

Yes, l did

You're talented, but your father...

Don't worry about my father

He has his own businesses

And l want to earn my own living

Will you hire me?

Sure

How much salary do you want?

Doesn't matter, but...

l'll need one month's salary in advance

Sure

Mr. Ling

Hey guys, call me Ling Xi

Orjust "Ah Xi"

l look forward to working with you

Sure... the same here

Here you go

Bye

See you

You know we have a lot to do?

No. Since l'm with you...

l'm not worried

We must look for a place to live first

We can only afford a small place

It doesn't matter

As long as we can squeeze in

Dad, l remember what you said

l've done something
you thought l couldn't do

If you want an apology

l'm sorry

l must take care of Cindy

l love her. L won't try to explain;

Because you might not understand...

the love between me and her

Your son-Xi

What do you think?

L like it

What about these two things?

Both are your favorites

But l like you more

What did you buy for yourself?

A karate jacket

My second favorite pastime,
other than cars

Show me some moves

Sure

Great...

Oh no, that was our only table!

We couldn't even afford chairs

Now we don't have the table

Don't worry, we can eat on the floor

Go to bed, you've had a long day

You must be tired

You...

l'll sleep on the floor here

We'll try to save up more money

If you can't sleep, sing for me

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

l like the house that you put me in

l adore the table and the bed

l like the doll and the perfect guitar

l like the way you do your show

But finally l like you most of all

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

Forget the clouds & the butterfly

Watch the star that twinkle in the sky

Gather the flowers and in a nice bouquet

l put all the stars into your heart

Just to show l like you most of all

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

Ling Xi, l'll grow up very soon

Then l can be your good wife

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

l like the house that you put me in

l adore the table and the bed

l like the doll and the perfect guitar

l like the way you do your show

But finally l like you most of all

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

Forget the clouds & the butterfly

Watch the star that twinkle in the sky

Gather the flowers and in a nice bouquet

l put all the stars into your heart

Just to show l like you most of all

You are 21, l'm 16

This is just the reason, they know,
that we're together

Let's go to my place after
you've picked up the car

Is my car ready?

Look, still working on it

What's wrong with you people?

Just a small problem
& you've worked on it for days

It's not exactly a small problem

He discovered a small crack
in the main axle

It will take a while

Bullshit. My car is a famous make

A crack on the main axle?

Who's he? The automobile authority?

Ling Xi

Ling Xi, what's going on with you?

Several times your dad
has asked me about you

l'm fine

Sorry, my hands are dirty

Come on, let's go

Let me know,
l'll send someone to pick it up

Sure, Mr. Wang

Ling Xi, l'm about to leave
for U.K., you...

Bon Voyage

Let's move

You know them?

Classmates

What's the hurry?

L wanted to talk to Ling Xi

You know what he's been up to

Living with an under-age singer...
what a mess!

L wonder what's going on

l don't believe it

It's the truth, he's so thin

He must be using drugs

We better stay away from him

No matter what, we were good friends

If he's done bad things...

we should help him

That's easy for you to say. Think about it

If his dad can't persuade him, can you?

He likes the flirtatious type,
a songstress

He's not interested in you

What are you talking?

Ling Xi, are you on drugs?

L can barely afford regular meals

You knew that Mr. Wang?

He said you're living with a singer

She's under age

None of his business

None of their business

Ling Xi, but it concerns me

l don't want my staff to get into trouble

There won't be any

See, if there's something wrong
with my work...

l'm satisfied with your work

No troubles, remember

Manager, Cindy hasn't been
making a lot by singing

And besides, she has him to support.
Poor girl!

Streets full of people, all alone

Roads full of houses, never home

Church full of singing, out of tune

Everyone's gone to the moon

Everyone's gone to the moon

This is it?

Auntie, cousin Cindy is singing
in this club

l saw her, l followed her

l know where she lives

She's living with a teddy boy

Excuse me

Why would you come to places like these?

No big deal

If l've never been here
how can l find Cindy?

Got to feel that she seem younger

Lovely hair flowing free

As l sit there watching all

l wonder if that girl can be me

Loving river flows across...

Cindy

Why did she stop?

We were in the middle of dancing

What's that woman doing?

Cindy

Come home, Cindy

It's not too late to reform yet

Why? L didn't do anything wrong

How could you say that?

You hang out with a teddy-boy

Who?

Ah Qiang saw you

He doesn't wear anything decent

You must be supporting him

What happened to you, Cindy?

Cindy

l won't go back

He's like a poisonous snake

He won't let you go

We better call the police

You are the poisonous snakes

Are you alright, Cindy?

L'm fine

Well then. Everyone's waiting...

for you to go back on stage

l should head back

Cindy

Cousin

l saw Cindy. She's bugged by a Teddy Boy

That's Ling Xi

l don't want to know, she's not my child

Check it out

l heard his father runs a factory

Yes, l know. He's called Ling Yuanneng

He's a business associate of mine

What do you want?

Go beg him to be strict with his son

To let go of our Cindy

Fine, l'll make a fool of myself

Congratulations

Thanks

Even after a 20 hour flight...

you look pretty good

As long as the plane doesn't crash

...l'd be fine

Dad, Xi should know that l'm back

How come he's not here yet?

It's been 3 years,
do you think he's changed?

Dad

Let's have a chat, Ling Zhao

Please don't mention
your brother to your dad

Why not?

What happened to Ling Xi?

Was he in an accident?

No, he doesn't live at home anymore

Why don't you entertain the guests?

L want to speak with Yunling

Ling Xi, you have a visitor

Ling Xi

Brother

When did you come back?

This afternoon

Ling Xi, there's a welcome party at home

l want you to be there

So? No guts, huh?

L don't know the details

Everyone makes mistakes,
but it can be corrected

l didn't do anything wrong

You didn't? Come with me then

Fine, l'll go. Welcome back

Your shirt

Mr. Ling

Congratulations

Mr. Ling, l'm Xin Zhenqiang

Pleased to meet you

We've met before, you are...

Sorry, l didn't know you have guests

We...

What can l do for you?

It concerns your son, Ling Xi

You are...

l'm that miserable father

My daughter is with Ling Xi

Please tell your son
to leave my daughter alone

Ling Xi doesn't live here anymore

l'll take some legal actions

Do you think
you can avoid responsibilities?

L'm going to hire a lawyer...

and declare that l've disowned my son

Sorry to disturb you

Dad, look whom l've brought here

Mr. Ling, you're a man of status

l couldn't believe that you lied

What are you doing back?

Ling Xi, let me warn you...

If you don't bring my daughter back,
l'll sue you

Don't hit him

What? L'm not hitting a human

He's an animal

Cindy is not even 16

And they are living together

Ling Xi, tell me it's not true

We're living together

And we're happy

You...

He threw his own life down the drain

He's been brought up in a good family

He's supported by a singer. So shameless

His next step might be towards a murder

2 boys from same family.
His brother is doing so well

He'll end up in jail if he keeps this up

He deserves to be locked up

...more than anyone

Shameless teddy-boy, living off a girl

Loser, useless, hopeless...

Shameless, good-for-nothing

lives off a girl

Goes to jail...

Ruffian, teddy boy

Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Let him go

Mr. Xin, don't worry

l'll bring back your daughter

What are you doing?

Hereafter l don't want to see you around

Look at yourself

What?

Lives off a girl?

Move over, we're running a business here

Don't block our way

So? What have l done to you?

Let go

If l see you here again...

l'll fire Cindy

Look, one mention of Cindy

...and he has nothing to say

What would he live on
if Cindy's not working?

Get hold of him

Go, come on

Stop it, Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Freeze

Stand still

There he is

Dad, l think this is a bit too much

"...disowning his son..."

Read this before you judge me

Ling Xi, get up. Time to work

Get up

Forget it. What happened last night...

It's going to be in the papers

Guess the garage
won't be keeping me anymore

"Teddy Boy Rages a Night Club"

"Young Songstress
boards the Police Car in Tears"

How could they write that!

Who cares what they say

How many people...

would want to find out the truth?

They judge people
without much understanding

"Notice on Mr. Ling Yuanneng
disowning his son"

Punks like him should be put in jail

Not only that we'll need to find work

...we'll also need to find
a new place to live

Let them be

This is your revenge to the society

l don't want a revenge

It's just the way l live

They are against me

But l don't care

Get in the car, Ling Xi

You must be Cindy, right?

L don't know how to address him now

He used to be my elder brother

Get in

What are you doing?

Cindy, this is your home

l'm sending you home

You... No

Don't touch her, Ling Zhao

She's a good girl,
she shouldn't be with you

She can choose...

who she wants to be with

No one can speak for her

She doesn't know what she's doing now

How do you know?

It's hard to judge...

whether one's mature enough

But legally, she's under age

Damn the law

Come on

Move away

You...

Don't make me beat you, Ling Zhao

You can try

Cindy

Cindy

Cindy

Cindy

Ling Xi

Come with us

Drag her inside

Cindy, go home

Call the police if you have to

Thanks

Ling Xi

Come with us, Cindy

l don't want to go home

Cindy

Come with us

l don't want to return

Come on, Cindy

Go on

No, l don't want to go home

Hurry

Ling Xi, l hope you'll get back
on the right track

l didn't do anything wrong

Take a look

Get down...

Ling Zhao

Can you stay on for a few more days?

No, it's the beginning of the semester

What do you want me to do?

You're leaving tomorrow

But Ling Xi won't be out in another 3 days

l think you should go pick him up

Talk to him, try to persuade him

What's the point?

He insists that
he didn't do anything wrong

He won't listen to me

Ling Xi doesn't admit that he's wrong

How can he make things right?

Dad is ignoring the whole thing

But l know he's worried about it

Everyone's worried

Ling Xi, get back on the right track

l didn't do anything wrong

You beat up two cops

Hu Bing

l don't want to see you again

If l don't get caught, you won't

Ling Xi, look, everyone's here

Come look for me should you need help

Ling Xi

Just leave, l don't need pity

You...

l need to be understood;
Don't you get it?

At least you admit that you don't

But the others with their own opinions

They think they understand

Ling Xi, who are you talking about?

You throw your own life away

You have ruined your own name

It's our bad luck
to have a classmate like you

What?

Ling Xi, you want to get locked up again?

It's your fault. Why did you drag us here?

L've already told you

He's hopeless

Ling Xi, are you mad?

No, miss. It's my fault

Since everyone says that it's my fault

l've just got to admit it

Just run, or l might rape you

Get out

Go

Get out

Is that him?

L recognize him.
His picture was in the paper

How's your songstress girlfriend?

Playing tough, huh?

Brother Zhou, his name is Ling Xi

What can you do?

Drive, fix the cars

What do you do?

Us?

We do big business

Good, we could use you

And l could use you

Interested in fighting?

You...

Yes, it's me.
The guy who lives off a woman

What do you want?

Why should l do now?

No...

Let's go

Come on

Look, Cindy.
It's lucky that you're not with him

Just imagine

"Violent gang robs night club"

Don't believe this, it's not true

"Manager beaten up"

"Suspect Ling Xi wanted by Police"

Ling Xi, l could use your help today

Get me a car

l thought we were just supposed to
pick a fight

Why did you rob the place?

Otherwise what would we live on?

L need a car

Open up, it's police

Open up

The door?

Hurry

Stand still

Over there

Hands up

Stand still

Hands in the air

Over there

Don't move

Stop washing your face

No water can cleanse your faults

He's the one

Don't move

Put down your gun, Xiao Zhou

Let's go

Ling Xi, this is your last chance

Hand over the gun, and await your trial

Squat down

Let's go

If not for Ling Xi earlier...

Hand over the gun to the police

Go

Stop it

Ling Xi, you should know that...

we'll listen to Brother Zhou

Don't try to be smart

Hand over the gun to the police

You can't kill

Who wants to kill?

But with this gun...

we could've achieved a lot more

l'll kill you first if you keep nagging

Have you got the bullets?

Go

Robbery

Where are you going?

Wait

Bye

So, you do smile

l've never seen you smile before

Special report by the police

He's allegedly connected to
three accounts of robbery

The police say
he is considered highly dangerous

The police has intensified their search

Should you have any information,
please contact...

We ought to try our hand at something big

Ling Xi

Ling Xi

Brother Zhou's talking to you

Get a car

A good one, luxurious sedan

You've already hurt two men

You might kill someone next

What if l do?

No, l'm backing out

Ling Xi, you're not a friend

You've got your share already

l just think this is getting too messy

l didn't do anything wrong...

in the beginning.
But now l'm getting trapped

Damn it, even you're educated

But you're the same as the rest of us

So what if your dad's rich?

Don't mention my dad

Just go get the car ready

Give me the bullets

What do you want?

Selling us out to the police, huh?

L...

l might turn myself in

Ling Xi, run

Damn

Ling Xi, get down here

Or l'll shoot

Sounds like a shoot-out

No way

Call the cops

Go

Ling Xi, you've been surrounded

Surrender and drop your gun

Looks like they're fighting each other

Get the marine police to help

Yes, sir

Ling Xi, you can't get away. Surrender now

This is your last chance

Last warning, surrender now

Surrender

Go, Ling Xi

Maybe he tried to break away from them

But it's too late
