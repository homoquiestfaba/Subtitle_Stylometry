Took you long enough.

Give me
a god damn break,

I had to wait for him
to fall asleep...

But he wouldn't.

He just kept going,
and going...

Aw, you poor thing,
my heart bleeds for you...

You know, you didn't
have to be there;

You didn't have to
look him in the face,

Knowing
what I was going to do.

If tommy caught me, he...

He'd have cut your eyes out,
and fed them to you.

Whatever, he didn't.

Let's just remember
the point of all this

Is so that you don't have
to keep giggling

Those little mammaries
of yours at some numb-nuts

Greaseballs all night,
remember?

Let's keep our eyes
on the end zone sisters,
shall we?

Good or bad,
we're in this together.

**

[Music stops]

[Engine turns off]

[Birds chirping]

[Door opens]

Jesus, Teig,

What the hell
made you think

Of this old house
to hold up in?

For the same reason
you didn't.

It's off
everyone's radar.

No one has lived here
for ten years;

That means no cable bills,
no utility bills,

Nothing under a company
record to find on the web.

Its got well water,
kerosene heater,
the works.

We're totally
off the grid.

Is it safe here?
Absolutely.

No one outside our family
knows about this place

Now that dad's gone.

We're twenty miles from B-F-E;
I got us stocked

With enough food and water
to last us a couple weeks,

We won't have
to go back into town

And be seen
by any of Tommy's gun-dogs...

Yeah, its safe.

Its just
kind of empty...

And cold.

Well I am sorry
that you both think so.

I guess
all my extensive planning
has been in vain,

You know, I tell you what;
lets just leave, ok?

Sirah, you can just give
your boyfriend back his drugs,

And ask him to take
pity on us poor,
dumb little girls.

Hey, maybe his boys
will just take it out
of our assess

And not fucking dismember us;
does that sound like a plan?

Whatever.

It's only two weeks...

That's right,
just two weeks.

What do you say, Lil?

Better than
getting circumcised

By Tommy's
butterfly knife?

Good!

Well, if our little
committee meeting's

Over then,
we'll get started.

Give me your phones.

Our phones?

I didn't go through
all this planning

So one of you nimrods
could fuck it up

Sexting some douchebag.

Cell phones, now.

We stick to the plan.

We lay low for two weeks,
we don't go outside

And show our faces

Until they stop
looking for us.

They'll figure
we skipped town.

Slip out,
middle of the night,
and get away.

It's the best plan.

Would have been a
better plan with a TV.

[Slow eerie music]

[Music continues]

It's going to be
a little rough for you,

The next few weeks,
isn't it.

I can hack it...

I need to.

Specially if all we're doing
is going to be worth it.

I just realized
you've never been here
before, have you?

No.

I figure
your mom would have

Probably had some objections
with me, and my mom,

Coming up for a visit
with dad.

Yeah.

Things would have been
a little tense,

To say the least.

Trust me, you weren't
missing anything.

[Music continues]

[Music stops]

Really?

Really what?

There must be
beds upstairs?

Most houses
have beds.

They're usually in little
second-floor rooms,

Called bedrooms.

We should all sleep together
in the same room,

Near an exit.

For safety.

Yeah, she's right;

We should all stay together
down here.

I'm going to go
get something to eat.

Fuck, Teig, could you have
gotten something
with more carbs?

[Crickets chirping]

Five, six, seven...


Ha ha,
two hundred dollars, please.

Ah, crap.

Wouldn't this be great
if this was real money?

What?

Idiot.


[Ominous music]

[Music stops]

Can you fucking
knock first?

Sorry.

Jesus, Lil,
it's not a slumber party.

Put some pants on.

[Ominous music]

[Tense music]

Its just a fucking room.

Oh really?

How 'bout the cellar,
you wanna go
hang out down there?

Its just a room, too,
right?

Hey.

How you feeling?

Like shit.

I can't sleep;
and when I do,

I have all kinds of
fucked-up dreams.

It'll pass.

Hang in there.

This is the best thing for you,
no matter how hard.

I know.

Hey,

You're tougher than this,

Remember that.

Thanks, Teig.

Come on,

I got a case of beer
in the fridge.

That'll take
the edge off.

No, no, no...

Okay, this guy is like
totally wasted,

Okay, the security guard
wrestling with him,

And he will not
let go of my boobs,

Like he's hanging on
to the little girlies
for dear life.

'cause all I'm thinking is;

He's going to rip
the fucking things off.


What did you do?

One of my regulars
knocked him over the head

With a bar stool; boom!

Ass-hat goes down,
titties are safe.

Boy got a free lap dance
for that move.

Your turn.

Pass.

No no,
Sy and I already went,

There's no one left
to pass to.

[Pop sound]

All right.

I was hooked up
with this guy in Tucson,

He rebuilt cars,

At least that's what it said
on his tax return.

What he really did
was take old junkers

And weld bricks of meth
inside the framework
to smuggle.

It had long since gotten old,
I was way over it,

I was packed,
all set to leave.

It's, uh, three o'clock
in the morning...

And there's
a knock on the door,

So Wolf gets up...

Wolf?

Yes, that was
his name, Wolf.

What?

Anyway, Wolf gets up

And goes to answer the door,
and it's the sheriff

And his whole
fucking posse.

Stupid bastard tried
to fight off three of them,

They handed his ass to him,
and there I am,

Stark fucking
naked in the bedroom,

Three deputies
bust down the door,

And next thing you know,
I'm co-habitating

In a ten by ten cell

With a 300 pound
shut-in named Druscilla

Who beat her husband
to death with a meat tenderizer.

Yeah, right about then

Was when I knew
I needed to find a way out...

One last score.

Must be weird
for you guys, huh?

Being back in this house?

Weird is one word
for it.

This is where Teig (stumbles)
this is and I's mom died.

Oh.

God, I'm sorry.

I didn't know.

It's all right, kid.

It's not something
we talk a lot about.

Hey, I didn't mean
to bring up bad stuff.

Don't sweat it, kid.

Yeah, I mean,
you were probably too young

To remember it, anyway.

Dad didn't come back to this
house after that, did he?

Well, we pretty much
stayed with aunt gracie
from then on,

We didn't see much of him
after that...

Til we found out
about the cancer.

Thing is,

Dad was a different
person

Around you
and your mom, Lil,

Than he was at home.

Around us, he was, uh...

Yeah.

We'll just stick
with different.

I'm sorry.

Don't sweat it.

Water under the bridge,
its all in the past.

Oh no you didn't!

Come here!


Bad sun, go away...

[Bottles clanking]

How are you
not in any pain?

Who, me?

I don't get hungover.

How?

I don't know...

Its probably some
recessive genetic defect.

Pretty cool though,
huh?

God, I'd hate
to be you guys.

Ugh.

[Bottles clanking]

[Ominous music plays]

[In unearthly voice]
Sirah... Sirah stops,

Lilly?

[In unearthly voice]
Sirah...

[Footsteps approaching]

Yes.

Look what we found.

[Television static]

Lilly!

It's not going to work...

It will!

I just have to
get it tuned in first...

Tell you what,
you keep at it,

And I'm going to go
take a shower.

Fuck.


Fuck!

Hey, you think this has
anything to do with it?

Fucking bullshit house.

Well, I guess
I'll go for a walk outside.

Oh, no you don't,

You're parking
that skinny little ass
right here in this house,

You are not walking
out that door.

Teig,
the tv doesn't work!

What the hell are we
supposed to do with
ourselves?

It's been what,
three days,

And you're already
going batshit?

Jesus its going to be
a long couple of weeks;

I knew it was a bad idea
to bring you along.

I can deal!

I'm just bored,
that's all.

You'll survive,

Just keep thinking about
the payoff at the end.

That's what will get you
through the waiting.

Voice of experience
talking?

[Tense music plays]

[Music builds]


Jesus!

You scared
the fuck out of me!

Give me that towel.

What's up?

Nothing.

Big sis is
pulling rank again,
says I can't go out?

I'm not her kid,
just because
we have the same dad

Doesn't make her
the boss of me

No matter
what she says or thinks!

Just let it ride,
all right?

Trust me, you do not want
to go toe to toe with Teig,

She will make your life
a living hell.

So what do you do,
just let her walk
all over you?

How is that okay?

Because if you can
manage that,

She'll do all the brainwork,
and you'll enjoy
all the profits.

Just be cool,
stay out of her way.

Teig's going through
a lot of shit right now,

Things will go back
to normal

When she sells the off stuff
to her contact.

Normal?

I sure
as hell hope not,

Our version
of normal sucked!

Si, what are
we going to do

If Teig's
guy doesn't...

Doesn't show up
at the end of the month,

And pick up
the suitcase?

Same thing we do if he does;
just head down south,

We just do it without
a shit ton of money,
I guess.

Teig will figure
something out.

[Ominous music]

[Music stops]

You okay?

I don't like
this place.

Look, I know its hard
for you right now...

No!

There's something
wrong with this place;

You telling me
you don't feel it?

You should eat
something.

I'm not hungry.

Honey, you need
to eat something,

You're going
to be sick.

Okay,
I'll just-i'll leave it
right here, its cereal.

Just try to eat some,
all right?

Here.

Thanks.

She's hasn't eaten
in two days,

I'm getting worried.

All part of the process.

She'll be sick
for a couple of days,

Then when she kicks it;

She'll be eating everything
insight trust me.

She thinks there's something
wrong here, this place.

Do you think maybe...

Maybe
we should tell her...

Absolutely not.

Its just the junk talking.

Keep an eye on her
while she weans...

It'll work itself out
of her system soon enough.

You ever worry
that some day you're going
to be wrong about something?

[Soft music plays]

[Footsteps approaching]

[Tense music playing]

You fucking
little traitor!

We put our asses on the line
and you're just
going to sneak out

In the middle of the night
with your fix?

I was just going out
for some air...

Oh yeah, you were
just going out for some air?

Were you taking these
for a walk, too?


Teig, take it easy...

Stay of it, Sirah.

I knew bringing along
the half-breed was a bad idea!

She's our sister.
Dad fucked our whore
of a mom, that's it!

We don't owe her
jack shit!

She'd sell us back
to tommy and his boys

For just the littlest
taste of that.

What if I promise to keep
an eye on her all the time?

Yeah, no offense,
but that would require me
to fully trust you as well.

Well if you don't,
then what the fuck are we doing?

Oh, jesus.

Don't you turn on me too.

Look, I do trust you,

I just don't trust that
she won't try to talk you
into letting her go.

Her type's sneaky like that;
they'll do anything,

Say anything,

Pray on your
fucking humanity.

Do you mind not talking
about me like I'm not here?

Jesus christ I can't wait to get
out of this fucking place.

I don't care
what you say,

We're blood, Teig,
the three of us;

You can't just treat her like
some god damn prisoner of war.

Do not try and tell me
what I can, and can't do,
this is my gig!

I put this whole thing together
and I'm the one that goes back

For a third strike
if it goes south, not you,

And not that
fucking junkie in there.

What, you think
I'm being hard on her?

Can you imagine
what it would be like for her

In prison
if we get busted?

How long to think
she'd last, huh?

With her little sensitive soul,
and her pixie-ish good looks,

Those women would
fucking eat her alive.

That girls is way past
needing some tough love,

Trust me; I'm doing her
the biggest favor of her life.

Well, I just think that...
Hey sirah?

If I want your opinion,
I'll fucking ask you for it,
okay?

You did your part,

This is mine.

Let me do it.

[Ominous music]

[Music builds]

[Music stops]

You probably gotta piss
like crazy about now, huh?

You got your shit
wired back together?

We'll see.

Better?

Yeah.

Thanks for asking.

What?

You going to watch?

Where am I going to go,
down the drain?

Don't push me, little girl.

This remind you of anything
from the inside?

Love and foreign objects
in the group shower?

You wouldn't want to know.

Hey, Lil?

No.

For what it's worth...

You're right,

I was out of my mind.

I'm sorry, really.

I would have fucked it up
for all of us.

Yeah well...

Anyway,

I'll let you finish up.

**

* music ends

So let me get this straight;

You left her alone

And unsupervised
in the bathroom?

Don't start
with me sirah.

All this planning
and you didn't think
to bring a flashlight?

We weren't supposed
to be going outside!

That way.

Come on!
Fuck her!

She'll give up
and come back, right?

I mean, its like
twenty miles to town.

Yeah, or she could make it
back to the highway,

And get picked up
by some truckers,

They take her
to the emergency room;

Who the hell knows
what she's going to say...

Or she could not make it,
messed up as she is,

She'll come out
into these woods,

Go in and never
come back out again,

Did you ever think
of that?

No.

Okay, I can't hear her anymore,
we gotta split up.

I'll go this way,
you go down,

Remember the house is downhill
and to the south, okay.

Right.

who are you?

Fucking conniving
little cunt!

I ought to carve you
a new asshole for the shit

You put us
through tonight.

Tommy and his boys
are out for blood and...

You know what, fuck it, why am
I even wasting my breath? Get
up, you little fucking bitch.

Junkie, get back
to the house!

Lilly?

Teig?

Hey?

God damn it!

Here, now!

Sirah?

Sirah are you here?

No, Teig!!
No!

Teig! No!

Look, there's something
bad here, okay, I saw...

Look, you might
want to think about

Keeping that little cumhole of
yours shut-

No! Teig!
In fact...

Thanks to you-be still-

Now I have to go out
into the woods

And find my other sister.
No!

And you better be in exactly
the same place when I get back!

Ah, good, the whole family.

Where do you think
you're going, pretty girl?

You know sirah?

You really are a hot
little piece of ass.

And don't take this
the wrong way or nothing

But the last few days,
I've had this nagging feeling

That that little bit
you call a brain.

Ain't nowhere near
capable of

Planning this little scheme
all by yourself.

Drop it honey.

And why is it I don't think

Sirah decided to betray me
all by herself?

Why do I think somebody
persuaded her
to steal my property?

Well, I'm glad to see
you girls didn't have

Too good a time
the last few days with my junk.

How'd you find us?

I can't take all the credit
for that one.

You've got your sister
and her talkative little fingers
to thank for that.

I don't know
how you kept this one

Away from all this
badness in a baggie.

Then again, maybe I do.

You try to get yourself
a little fix, little girl?

Is that why you're
over here in timeout?

Leave her alone fucker.

You, you little firecracker.

You need to learn
when to keep that cute
little mouth of yours close,

And when to open it.

You want something
down there, huh?

You want my gun?

Yeah, I bet you do.

And, we come to you,

You gorgeous
little troublemaker.

Fucking stop it!

Big sister needs
to sit this one out!

Unless if she wants me
to talk with this hand...

I will kill you,

I swear to god
if its the last thing

I do on this earth
I will fucking kill you.

Its your fucking fault

Your sisters
are in this position, Teig.

And it will be your fault

When they're both
going to die as well.

How about I just blow a hole
in your fucking skull,

Put you out of your
misery fast,

And then take my time
with your little sisters.

What do you think of that?

Don't take it
too personally, though,

You've got some
smoking little body.

Hell, I may even
get tired of them,

And take a turn with you.

I mean, you don't exactly
got to have a head

For what I got in mind.

Yeah?
Why wait?

Let's go...

Or are you afraid I'll call you
on what a lousy fuck you are?

You wanna learn
what happens to little girls

When they try and play
with the big boys?


I wonder
what it would feel like,

Fucking blowing your brains
out right as I finish...

Lilly, cut me loose.

[Muffled cry]

That is why I said
no cell phones.

Jesus,
this fucker is heavy.

Shouldn't we bury him?

Fuck him!
Let the crows have him.

I mean for us,
so nobody finds him.

No one's coming near here.
He did.

Yeah, well that's because
if someone wouldn't
use their phone...

I didn't...
Oh save it!

So, I guess this pretty much
changes everything, right?

This changes nothing!

But with tommy dead...

We stick to the plan.

But...
we stick to the plan.
No changes.

Changes are dangerous.

And staying put in the
same zip code of the guy
we just killed isn't?

God, she keeps doing that!

Hey... So, uhm, are you...

I'm fine,
just don't touch me.

[Ominous music]

One of us should
really go up there.

Look, I know you don't
want to go upstairs...

No, its fine, okay?

I need to do it.

Teig?
Is everything okay in there?

Teig,
are you okay in there?

We'll just, you know,
give her another day.

If she doesn't come down
I'll come back up.

Jesus, you look like shit.

And you're ice cold, too.

Are you ever going to tell me
what the hell happened up there
when you were kids?

It doesn't concern you.

Like hell it doesn't!
Okay?

I know something happened
upstairs in that room,

I know it,
I can feel it.

Fuck, the whole house
is seething with it.

Just get off of me.

Sy, please tell me
what the hell is going on here!

Our mom was pregnant
with our little sister,

Really pregnant.

Dad had been at the bottle
all weekend, and,

And mom and him
had been arguing...

( arguing )

About my mom?

Yeah.

She knew about it all along,

I guess she just decided
to go along with it,

But,

All that changed
when she found out about you.

This fight, it was...

It was worse than
all the rest.

They were yelling, screaming,
throwing things.

It was horrible.

I heard mom tell dad that

She found somebody else...

And that the baby
wasn't his.

Something just happened to him.

He just stopped yelling,
just like that.

Then without saying a word...

He went back upstairs,
and shut the door.

He didn't come out
for two days, not to eat,

Not to drink, nothing.

Mom didn't talk to us
the whole time.

Teig and I just
sat and played

Quiet little games to ourselves.

And then,

I heard mom,
in the kitchen.

She started to scream...

These long, horrible
wailing sounds.

We didn't know
what to do.

Finally, Teig she went
upstairs to get dad.

By the time he came down,

The kitchen floor
was covered with blood.

Something was wrong
with the baby.

She begged him
to call the doctor.

But he wouldn't do anything.

He just stood there,
staring at her.

Finally he picked mom up,
and carried her up the stairs.

What did he do to her?

Nothing.

He didn't do anything.

He just stood there watching

As her and her baby died.

We have to get out
of this place, sy.

Oh, hey, hi.

How you doing?

You texted tommy?

I had a guilty moment.
I felt bad.

I mean, we did sorta
put him in a bad spot,

Him losing all his
merchandise, and stuff.

Tommy and I,
its always been...

Complex.

You told him
where we were.

No, no I swear
to god I didn't,

I don't know
how he found out,

Here, check my messages
if you don't believe me.

You betrayed all of us.

Just like she betrayed him.

Just like?

Just like listen
to yourself, Teig.

This house hasn't
just gotten to you,

It's gotten into you.

Look, Lilly
and I both want to go,

We just need the keys
to the truck.

You want to stay?
Fine.

But Teig,

You should
come with us, okay?

It is bad here.
Its really bad.

Teig?

Teig?

Teig, don't walk away
from me!

Fuck!

Fuck you looking at, girl?

Go away!

I said get the fuck
away from me!

What, you think I wouldn't?

I will, I fucking will,
and then where would you be?

I spent so many years hating you
for what you did to me,

What you took from me,
what you made me.

If you were here right now
I'd kill you with my bare hands.

Oh, what, you
think I couldn't?

Take on a big,
strong man like you?

Oh I could...

I have.

You forced me to turn myself
into something

That nobody could ever hurt,

And that's just
the shit of it, isn't it?

Everything I am,

Everything I've ever done
I owe to you,

You son of bitch.

You made me,

And then you broke me
into a hundred little pieces

And then you put me
back together again

Just the way you wanted...

Just like you.

Shh.
Not a sound.

Teig, just stop it.

Don't look at her,

She can't help you,
its just me and you.

Don't, Teig, stop it.

Beg me.
Stop it.

I bet you spread your legs
for every boy

With a dime bag
and a smile, don't you?

Poor little lost girl,

Nothing more than a mistake,

Evidence of lies
and broken lives.

Teig, stop, this
isn't you, its him.

Everything was fine
until you and your slut mother
came along,

You pushed her away,

You ruined everything,
you ruined everything!

Great.
Now what?

Are you sure this is the
best place to leave her?

Well, we sure as hell
can't have her running around
loose like that;

At least until we can
find a way to get her,

And us, out of here.

Come on, let's go,

I do not want to be here
when she wakes up.

No no

No no no no no no!

No no no!

You find the keys yet?

Not yet.

Where the hell
did she hide them?

No! No! No!

( Crying )

Its for her own good.

Okay, let's just look
in the living room, okay?

I can't even count
the number of times

I cursed you
down here as a kid.

I swore I'd never get
stuck down here again.

They'll pay for this...

Both of them.

I don't like
where this is going, sy.

Well, we don't really
have any choice, do we?

I mean, we can't get
anywhere on foot,

And I can't take it here
another week, can you?

Hey, its going
to be okay, all right?

No one else
is going to get hurt,

Not if I can help it.

Okay.

You and I need to talk.

Lilly and I
are leaving today.

I need the keys
to the truck.

Fuck Teig, say something!

I'm way past being tired
of your fucking shit,

Now hand over the keys!

Hand over that god damn
keys to the truck!

I knew you'd come back.

I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

I'm so sorry
for what happened to you.

I feel maybe it was...

Partly my fault.

You going to
shoot me, Sirah?

You don't have
the balls.

What are you doing to us?

Lilly is sick, and scared,
and I'm not far behind her.

Fuck Teig,
please, please...

We finally
just got together,

Please take us
the rest of the way.

We're all we have,
it's us.

Mom would have wanted...

Don't you bring that
fucking whore into this!

What you want, sirah?

You want us to be some
little happy family?

Well you should
have thought of that

Before you threw me
down here

And stuck that
fucking gun in my face.

You want the keys?

Sorry.

You two better
start walking

Because I'm not
giving you shit.

Fuck, Teig,
what are you going to do,

Stay down here forever,
just to prove a fucking point?

Maybe not forever.

Just until the end
of the month.

[Eerie voices]

Lilly!

Lilly, Lilly...

Lilly, jesus!

Shit!

Can you hear me, Lilly?

[Humming lullyby]

What are you singing?

[Lullyby plays]

Where...

Where did you hear
that song?

Lilly, that lullaby,
where did you hear it?

[In unearhtly voice] Lilly isn't
here now, honey.

I don't understand.

She's a very sweet girl,

She's just a little lost
right now.

You all are,
you poor dears.

I...

You've gotten so big...

I hardly even
recognized you.

No...

No...

Shh.
Mom?

Teig and you were always
at each other's throats,

But this won't do.

You can't...

You have to get out
of this place, Sirah.

You have to save
your sisters.

Its just that it's gotten
so crazy, I can't control it.

Teig always
was the strong one,

Like her father,
but she can't help you now.

She's in a dark place,
okay?

You have to take charge.

Mommy...

I need you
more than ever.

I can't do this
by myself.

Yes you can.

I miss you so much.

I miss you too.

I'm so sorry
I wasn't there,

To see you grow
into the woman you've become.

Its not your fault,
it was his.

He's here...
I can't stay.

You have to get out
of this place, Sirah.

You have to
save your sisters,

Or he'll be
the death of you,

Like he was me
and your baby sister.

Do what you need
to do, Sirah.

I love you.

I miss you so much.

Lilly!

[Music playing faintly]

[Ominous music plays]

[Music stops]

You'll forgive me
for not quivering with fear,

You're the second
sibling in two days

To come down here
and point that thing at me.

Right.

Would it help
if I said I'm sorry

For tying you to the bed
for eighteen hours?

Lilly isn't here now.

You...

You won't do it.

I won't let what happened
before happen again.

I won't let that
happen to them.

I won't let that
happen to you.

I thought
sirah could save you,
but she's not ready.

So you see, baby?

I have no choice left.

You have no choice left
but to what, to execute me?

Well fuck you!

No, you go away
for twenty years

And then,
and then you come back

And I'm just supposed...
No, no, no,

He won't let you,
he won't let you do this.

I'm sorry, baby.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry...

I tried to fight him,
I tried.

He was too strong,
I tried.

It was your fault,
you stupid whore,

It was-everything
was your fault,

It was your own fault.

You're coming home now baby,
you're coming home with me.

No...

I never left!

Bitch, fucking bitch
it was all your fault...

It was all your
god damn fault!

You can't have her...

Lilly?

Lilly?

Lilly?

Did you kill her?

See for yourself.

Go on, stand up.

So this is it, you just going
to fucking shoot me too,

Is this how this
whole thing ends?

The whole god damn thing was
supposed to rescue each of us

From the lives
we were stuck in,

You from the clubs,
me from prison,
her from the junk.

The truth is,
Lilly just wasn't strong enough
to make the change.

I wish I had another choice,
I didn't...

You did!

You have
all kinds of choices,

And you chose
to execute your own sister.

Remember you were the one
who brought her into all this,

I was all set
to leave her at home.

Its so easy for you,
isn't it?

You get to decide
who deserves to live,

And who deserves to die.

It's getting easier.

Might I also remind you
that you were ready

To kill me yesterday
over the keys to the truck?

But I couldn't.

Just tell me
where the suitcase is,

Then you and I can go
our separate ways,

And you can live the rest
of your life hating me,

I couldn't give a fuck,
I'm used to it by now.

Did you actually think
that you could just kill Lilly,

And I'm going
to walk away from it?

And it will all be okay,
even with just a little

Of our sister's blood
on our hands?

Back down, sis.

All I want is the stash.

Just tell me where it is.

Fuck you, Teig.

I ain't telling you
shit.

You want to kill me?

Go ahead
and fucking shoot me.

Then you can go
crawl off

Into some deep,
dark hole

And bleed to death
without the junk.

Don't push me,
little girl...

Don't push me,
little girl.

Has it really taken you
this long to realize

That underneath
that tough skin,

You're just
a scared little girl

Who's afraid of her daddy
having another bad night.

Maybe you'll say
the wrong thing

And you'll have to sit
in that cellar

All by yourself
in the dark...

Shut up...

Maybe he'll really go off

The rails this time...

Maybe he'll kill mom

And there won't be
a goddam thing
you can do about it...

Shut up... Shut up!
( gun clicks )

Out of ammo.


[Indistinct shouting]


[Knife clicks]



[Suspenseful music plays]

[Breathing heavily]

This is the last time
you ever fuck with me, girl!

[Singing voice] I know you're
here, sirah.

You know, I always
used to wonder why

It was dad took it out
on me and not you?

You never got the belt,
the back of the hand,
the cellar.

What kept you safe
all those times, huh?

What could you give him
that I couldn't?

Well, I guess
we'll never know.


[Indistinct shouting]

You!

Fucking! Bitch!

She trusted you!


You were supposed
to be our big sister...


[Ominous music plays]


[Dog barking]


[Engine shut off]

God dammit!

Fuck, fuck Teig!

[Suspenseful music plays]

Teig (O.S.) I know
what you're up to,

You're going
to take the stash,

And sell it yourself,
cut me out...

Well that's not
gonna happen!

Just a few more days
and we'd have been home free

On our way to mexico
with a hundred thousand dollars!

But you two had to get greedy,
and now Lilly's dead,

And you're just going
to have to die too.

I'm sorry Sirah,
really I am,

But if you'd just stuck
to the fucking plan...

There is no fucking plan
anymore, Teig!

The stash, it's gone!

I drowned it, I dumped it
in the lake by the house!

Sirah (OS) Get it?
It's fucking over,

There's nothing
worth killing for anymore!

I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

Eat that!
Take it!

[Breathing heavily]

You're the weak one.

You let him use you,
you let him make you a puppet.

Remember when I said
I couldn't?

Turns out I can.
