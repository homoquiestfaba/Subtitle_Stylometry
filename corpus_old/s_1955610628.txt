Katie: So you'd leave the
store for some big shot?

Drew: He's not
just some bigshot.

I mean Lance Bryant
happens to be

one of the stores
biggest customers.

The place wouldn't
exist without him.

Katie: Right.

Drew: And he's also one of the
most successful guys in town.

You know, he made the
"Forty under 40" list.

Katie: Yeah.

Katie: I know, but, okay.

Drew: Twice Katie.
Nobody does that.

Katie: That sounds very
impressive, it does.

Katie: But I mean you've been
working towards something

and I just don't know
that it's necessarily

the smartest thing to just
pick up and start over.

Drew: I don't think
you understand.

The guy is super loaded.

I'll probably get paid at least
triple what I'm making now.

It's not starting over.

Katie: Okay, but
what will the job be?

I mean, what does he even do?

Drew: What does he even do?

What does it even matter?

Katie: Oh God.

Drew: Okay, the
man sweats success.

Ever read his book?

Katie: No.

Drew: Well, there you go.

Katie: Have you read his book?

Drew: I've read the
first chapter of it.

Katie: Well, there you go.

Drew: Well, I've
read pieces of it.

I've read more than you have.

Katie: I just wonder
if you'd actually,

you know, if you're going
to be happier doing it.

Drew: Yeah.

Katie: Really?

Drew: Yeah.

Drew: I mean, I'm
nearly 30 Katie.

I can't be shoving
diningroom tables

into hatchbacks for
the rest of my life.

Katie: Hmm.

Drew: I got to strike now.

Strike that hot iron.

Mr. Clayton: Drew. Drew
DeLaney. I need you out back.

Drew: I got five more
minutes Mr. Clayton.

dealing with here?

Got to get out of this place.

Katie: The grass
is always greener.

Mr. Clayton, he's been
good to you. Okay?

Drew: No, Mr. Clayton can
eat a hot bowl of dicks,

is what I think.

Katie: Wow.

Lance: That right there.

That mother fuckin'
shit right there

is what pisses me off
more than anything else.

You can't just come to me

to my place of residence.

My mother fuckin' doorstep
and expect a handout.

A free fuckin' handout
that will not benefit me

in any way, shape, or
mother fuckin' form.

Drew: Uh, so did you end
up buying the cookies?

Lance: What the?

It's not about whether or not

I bought the cookies or didn't.

It's about these mother
fuckers are success suckers.

Didn't you read my book?

Drew: Well, I ...

Lance: Goddamn man.

Chapter two, paragraph six.

Yes, those who refuse
to work for success

are bloodsucking leaches,

leaches who will
success suck you dry

unless you annihilate them.

Drew: Oh yeah, annihilation.

Lance: Yeah.

Drew: Got it Mr. Bryant.

Lance: Dammit Drew.
Just call me Lance.

Drew: Yeah Lance.

Lance: Now in summation.

If those little
bitches come calling

and asking for handouts
while you're here

house-sitting you
have the green light

to use this on their asses.

Drew: Uh, we're still talking
about girl scouts. Right?

Lance: Yeah. This
may be air-powered,

but let me tell you something.

This can put a hole the
size of a grapefruit

through a squirrel
from 90 yards away.

Lance: Uh-huh

Lance: Watch yourself.

Drew: Oh.

Lance: Huh! Bam!

Lance: Drew.

Lance: Let's take a walk.

Lance: All right.

Don't let Mr. Baldwin get down
there by the horse stables.

All right. If he gets to dig in.

It will be a horrible mess.

Drew: You got horses?

That's fantastic.

I've never actually seen a
horse live in person before.

I've always kind of wanted to.

I've seen them in movies.

Lance: Stables.

You hear me say anything
about owning a damn horse?

Lance: Oh shit! I almost forgot.

Okay, so something, uh, well,

someone may be arriving
before I get back.

Special arrangement.

International arrangement.

Which could bring about

some unfortunate
misunderstandings

if not handled with a
clear and focused mind.

You feel me?

Drew: Uh, I'm not sure I follow.

Lance: Don't sweat it.

Lance: You, just toss her
into my master bedroom

if she comes before I get back.

That's it. You feel me?

Drew: Oh yeah.

Drew: I feel you.

Lance: All right.
See you do good

and you are going
to earn yourself

a spot in the big leagues.

All right? Ha-ha.

A lot of great things
going on at Team Lance.

Huh? Great things.

(rap music)

(opens door - beeper goes off)

(opens door - beeper goes off)

(beeper off)

Drew: Anyone here? Lance?

yeah, mother fucker,

Fresh up in this big hatch.

Drew: Oh, uh, who, who are you?

Marta: I'm Marta.

Mr. Lance tells you
coming to watch his house

and to take care of his doggie.

Drew: Yeah, yeah,
that's right, that's -

Marta: I'll be in
and out all weekend

cleaning Mr. Lance home,

but please, do no
mess up nothing! Hmm?

Drew: Mr. Baldwin, I presume.

me feel like a dog

You got me on your leash

Drew: Here you go Mr. Baldwin.

a grown man pant

You make a grown man dance

Drew: Time to eat Mr.
Baldwin. Eat it. Come on.

me on all fours

On my hands and knees

Just take me for a walk

Drew: Look. It's delicious.


You make me feel like a dog

(instrumental music)

(instrumental music)

You make me feel like a frog

Like a prince [unintelligible]

You make a grown man wild

You make a grown man a child

You make me feel something new

I could learn from you

Just give me all your mind

News reporter: Gracias Juan.
Although local and federal

law enforcements won't
offer up many details

on the investigation
they do say that

this human trafficking ring
may involve over 35 countries.

Agent Eddie Granger:
What we're looking at

is as an exploitation
scandal, uh, that is

more complex and
more sadistic, um,

than any that we've
encountered here

in the United States of
America on U.S. soil.

Um, so the citizens ...

(Doorbell rings)

which we hold dear, we
are working diligently -

Kamal: Excuse me sir.

So sorry to bother you on
this glorious day, but -

Drew: Kamal? Drew DeLaney.

Emily Dickinson High?

Mr. Martineau's history class?

Come on man! We made
that Vietnam video.

Kamal: Yeah, Drew. Right?

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: Yeah, I'm sorry.

I guess I didn't recognize you

with a shirt and the
tie, it's corporate.

Um, you've done pretty
well for yourself.

Drew: Oh! This house?

Actually it belongs
to Lance Bryant.

Kamal: Who is that?

Drew: You don't know
who Lance Bryant is?

Kamal: (nods no)

Drew: Anyway, if nothing
goes wrong while I'm here

he's going to give me a job.

Kamal: Really.

Kamal: Nice. House
sitting full time?

Drew: Uh, no, probably
more like, you know,

being his trusted
right hand man.

Kamal: Right hand man?

Kamal: Oh, I get
it. Right hand man.

Drew: No. You've
grown up so much.

Kamal: Right hand
man you're gonna ...

Drew: Don't, no, just don't.

Kamal: He's a powerful man.

Kamal: Powerful men need a hand.

Drew: How do you like it?

Drew: You like it.

Kamal: You got speed, speed.

Drew: How does that feel?

Drew: Job training. Right?

You're training from
a right hand man now.

Kamal: What are you digging for?

Delivery Guy: Now don't
stop on my account.

Love that shit!

You're lucky I'm
working. Especially you.

Anyway, who lives here?

Drew: I do. I mean
for the time being.

Delivery Guy: I
need a signature.

Drew: Sure. Yep.

Uh, so you, I guess
you could put it, uh,

right in here if you want.

Delivery Guy: Nah!
That's where it stops.

I don't haul shit.

(ominous music)

Drew: Hey man.

Hey you mind maybe giving
me a hand with this?

We just got to carry it,
carry it around back.

Just take about five minutes.

Kamal: I don't know.

I still got a lot
of houses to hit.

Drew: Yeah, sure. I
totally understand.

Come back later maybe.
Swing back around. Yeah.

Kamal: Um, good luck with
the house sitting though.

Drew: Yeah, should
be, should be fun.

Kamal: Yeah.

Drew: It was cool
seeing you man.

Kamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Drew: It's been a long time.

Kamal: Cool. Good luck.

Drew: Thanks man. You too.

Drew: 10 speeds?

Drew: 21. Wow. Do you
use, like, all of them?

Drew: Oh my gosh man.

Kamal: Yeah.

Drew: So what's in the case?


Drew: Whoa!

Kamal: SlicePro is top
of the line cutlery.

Won the Bronze at the
Homemakers Expo in '98,

then again in '02.

The shits legit.

Drew: It seems very sharp.

Kamal: So how much should
I put you down for?

The extended chefs arsenal?

Perhaps the nuclear
family traditional set?

Hey, either way.

I'll throw in a pair of scissors

that can cut through a penny.

On the house.

Drew: Thanks man, but I just,

I just can't really afford
any right now, you know.

Maybe if I get this
job I can totally -

Kamal: Playing hard ball, huh?

All right. How about this?

I'll throw in the fish
that you've been looking at

that opens bottles.

Huh? Life of the party here.

I work on 100%
commission, you know.

Drew: Hey why don't you,

why don't you hang
out for a while man?

I've got this huge place

all to myself, you know,
we could grab a drink,

reminisce about the old days.

Kamal: Nah, I better not man.

Drew: Come on Kam.
It will be fun.

Kamal: It's Kamal,
and I think I'm good.

Drew: Yeah. Yeah,
okay, yeah. Sorry man.

(dog steps)

Kamal: Was that a thong?

Drew: Yeah.

(ominous music)

Drew: The door was open man.

(ominous music)

Drew: Mr. Baldwin.

Look at this mess man.

Drew: Do you leave the
door open? He told me -

Kamal: Holy shit!

Drew: What?

Kamal: I think there's
someone in there.

Drew: What are
you talking about?

(ominous music)

Drew: Holy shit.

Kamal: Are you fucking with me?

Drew: No, I though you
were fucking with me man.

Kamal: Why would
I fuck with you?

Drew: I was going to
ask you the same thing.

Kamal: Someone is
fucking with us.

Drew: Someone is
fucking with us.

Kamal: Why the fuck
would a dead chick

get delivered
here. Right? Right?

I mean this is Lance
Bryant's house. Yeah?

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: And there's no
way that a dead chick

would get delivered here.

Drew: No.

Drew: It doesn't make sense.

Kamal: It doesn't
make any sense at all.

Drew: There's no way
it's a dead chick.

Drew: It's a dead chick.

Drew: Who do you think she is?

Kamal: You want to check
her for ID be my guest.

Drew: Lance told me
to keep an eye out

for something, something
that might raise eyebrows.

Kamal: Consider my
eyebrows fucking raised.

Drew: He figured
a woman was coming

to stay with him,
but he was so vague.

You know he called
it, he called it

an international arrangement.

Kamal: Sounds like a
mail order bride to me.

Drew: Is that what this is?

Kamal: How long do
you know this guy?

Drew: Uh, I mean he
comes into the store

like, once a month, you know,

to buy a bunch of stuff.

Kamal: So not very
well then. Huh?

Drew: Well I mean
we usually chit-chat

while I load things
into his car.

Kamal: Chit-chat. Jesus.

Drew: Well, it's longer
than a chit-chat.

Drew: It's like
conversations, we talk.

Kamal: It's a chit-chat man.

It's a chit-chat.

You chit-chat with this
guy and you don't know him.

Drew: It's like once a month

I talk to him for awhile.

Kamal: Yeah-yeah.

So you don't know him that well

and it's quite
possible that he could

be into some weird fucking shit.

Drew: No, Lance
Bryant is a legit guy.

Kamal: Yeah.

Drew: There's got to be a
reasonable explanation for this.

Drew: (sighs) Oh my God.
What are we going to do?

Kamal: We? Sorry man,
but this is your problem.

I got to get back to work.

Drew: Wait! You got
to help me with this.

We're friends.

Kamal: (laughs) Sure man.

Look, call the fucking police.

Let them sort it out, okay.

Drew: If I call the police

than Lance will get arrested.

Okay, no, he told
me to handle this

with a clear, focused
head is what he said.

If I screw this
up there's no way

I'm going aboard Team Lance.

You got to help me.

It's Team Lance Kamal.

(doorbell rings)


(Doorbell rings)

Spencer: Hello.

Spencer: Hi.

Spencer: Hi. I'm here to see
Lance Bryant, if I might.

Drew: Lance isn't
home at the moment.

Spencer: Who are you?

Drew: We're his friends.

We're friends of Lance's.

Spencer: Friends?
Friends of Lance?

Drew: Yeah.

Spencer: You're both
friends of Lance Bryant?

Drew: Yeah. We're kind
of busy at the moment

so if you don't mind
maybe coming back later.

We're going to head back.

Spencer: Excuse me, excuse
me, excuse me, gentlemen,

but this is a
neighborhood watch zone.

And I happen to be
Lance's neighbor

so maybe it's
appropriate for me to let

the authorities know
you're inside of his house.

Kamal: Please by all means.

Drew: No, no, no.


Drew: It's not, it's
not necessary, okay.

Look, we're just ... Lance,
Lance is on vacation.

Okay? And he asked me
to look after his place

until he gets back, that's all.

Neighbor: Well he never told me

anything about house sitters,

so you can imagine how -

Kamal: I'm not house
sitting, for the record.

Drew: I totally understand.

Spencer: Okay. Record.

Spencer: Okay. Well
I'm Spencer Shaw.

I live right down the street,

as I mentioned earlier,

so if you need anything
while you're here

just give me a jingle.

Drew: Great.

Drew: Oh doctor.

Spencer: That's
right. MD and PhD.

Spencer: I did them both.

Drew: Great. Good for
you. Congratulations.

That's a lot of work.

Spencer: Oh, and the mail. Yes.

I came to give Lance his mail

because unfortunately it gets

delivered to me by mistake.

We have dunderheads
running our postal service

here in the local area.

So there's not a
day that pretty much

doesn't go by where
there's postcards

or some periodicals of some kind

that gets mistakenly -

Kamal and Spencer: (Laugh)

Drew: Thank you for doing that.

That's so nice Dr. Shaw.

Thank you. It was
nice meeting you.

We'll see you around
the neighborhood

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Spencer: Oh, and by the way.

Just follow the exact sequence

that's on the card
that I gave you

number wise and my
phone will ring.

Drew: Wonderful.
Thank you. (sighs)

Drew: Oh man. We
got to move fast.

That guy is totally onto us.

Kamal: Us?

Kamal: Are you crazy?
This is all you.

Drew: What? He saw
you, too, Kamal.

Drew: So in his mind you're just

as connected to this as I am.

Kamal: Connected to what?

Drew. This.

Kamal: We didn't kill her.

We didn't box her
up and ship her.

We had nothing to do with this.

Think about it.

If we never would
have looked in the box

we never would
have known. Right?

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: The best thing we can
do is pretend nothing happened.

Drew: Exactly. Yeah, Yeah.

We need to cover this up

and make a pact to go silent.

Kamal: What?

Drew: We seal the box back up.

Pretend like we saw nothing.

You know, just like you said.

Kamal: I didn't say that.

Drew: It's perfect.

You know, this way
Lance will never know

that I know and then
I still get the job.

Yeah. We just need
to find some tape.

(ominous music)

Drew: We need to figure
out another plan.

Kamal: No. I need to leave

and you need to call the cops.

Drew: I can't screw
Lance over like that.

Kamal: What if Lance isn't
as legit a guy as you think.

I mean, think about it.

Why does he pick you?

Some furniture store
clerk to watch his house.

And why on the weekend when he's

expecting something important

does he decide to get
up and leave town?

Drew: You're not
seriously suggesting

that I'm part of some?

Kamal: Conspiracy?

Kamal: I don't know,

but it's hard to ignore
the fucking facts.

Drew: Oh hang on. Hang on.

There are three basic
principles to success.

Okay, okay, okay.
Number one. Reason.

Number two. Focus. Nmber three

Kamal: Go fuck yourself.

Drew: Effort. Okay?

We follow Lance Bryant's
book and we'll be fine.

Drew: Number one. Reason.

Make an informed choice.

It's not how to use your
mother fucking time.

It's how to use it the best
mother fucking way possible.

Drew: Yeah? Okay. Okay.
So based on our situation

we need to go get a
new box for her. Yeah?

It's crazy, we're already
a third of the way done.

Kamal: Have you even
read that book man?

Drew: Okay. Let's
do it. I'll drive.

Shit! Hey Marta.

Marta: Mr. Drew I
clean master suite now.

Drew: Actually can you
clean it later? Maybe?

Just a little bit later.

Like maybe in two hours.

Marta: No, Mr. Lance
will not be happy

if I don't clean
master suite now.

Drew: Right now. I get that

and you can totally clean it.

Just not, just not
right now, you know,

so maybe you can go
clean something else

for a while and then come back.

Marta: I must clean now.

Marta: No-no. It's not
on your time. Okay?

Marta: (speaking in Spanish)

Drew: I don't speak
Spanish Marta.

That's not the [unintelligible]

Five minutes?

Can you go clean something
else for a while?

And then come ...

Kamal: It's cool.
We're finished.

Drew: Uh yeah. We're finished.

Marta: (mumbles in Spanish)

Drew: What the fuck

Kamal: Follow me.

Marta: (grumbling in Spanish)

Kamal: I had to act fast.

I'm thinking we should find
a better place for her.

Somewhere out of the sun.

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: Don't you want to
know how I got her out here?

Drew: No.



Girl Scouts: Wanna
buy some cookies?

Drew: What did you
say little girls?

Girl Scouts: Wanna
buy some cookies?

Drew: Uh, sure,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'd love to buy some cookies.

Um, wow. Okay, great, um,

I'll take them all. So that's -

Okay. So here you go.

That's for you. Okay thank you.

Great. Uh, thank you.

Kamal: Experiment in college.

I didn't get two.

(garage door closes)

(Marta thumping mat)

Kamal: How long do
we have to wait?

Drew: Until she's gone, I guess.

Kamal: Well then, I'm
going to have a beer.

Kamal: Not even a little
something to take the edge off?


Drew: I've got work to do man.

Kamal: I think we've
earned one drink.


Drew: Yeah okay. This is it.

(Rock music)

(Rock music)

(somber music)

(somber music)

Drew: Kamal? Kamal?

(somber music)

Drew: (alarm goes off)

(beeping - alarm squealing)

(beeping - alarm squealing)

(alarm stops - phone ringing)

Kamal's voice: You've
reached Kamal with SlicePro!

Leave a message. (Beep)

Drew: Yeah. Hi Kamal. It's Drew.

Drew DeLaney. Do
you remember me?

Uh, you were here at
Lance Bryant's house.

Yeah, you were going to help me

with an extremely
unfortunate situation

we found ourselves in.

You remember that?

Uh, well, I just wanted to call

and say thanks for nothing.

Yeah. I'm not sure
if you've heard,

but, friends don't ditch
friends. (doorbell ringing)

Not how it works.
(doorbell ringing)

So, good luck with your
crappy job (knocking)

selling crappy knives to crappy
people (doorbell ringing)

that I'm sure I'll be stuck
doing something equally crappy

since you left me high
and dry with this.

Uh, hope to never see
you around again Ass.

Okay, best wishes, Bye.
(doorbell ringing)

Drew: Uh!

Barry: Mr. Bryant?

Drew: Uh, well I'm ...

Barry: Vault Home Security.

Drew: Uh, great.
Look, I think I ...

Barry: Is everything
all right in there?

Your panic alarm was triggered.

Drew: Yeah, and everything
is fine. Thank you.

Barry: Mind if I take
a quick poke around?

Drew: Well yes, it's not
really the best time.

You know, it's fine.

I mean, I'm pretty sure
I set it off myself,

so nothing to worry about.

Barry: Quite possible sir,

but better safe than sorry.

That's the Vault
Home Security motto.

Drew: I understand
it's your job,

but this is completely
unnecessary.

Barry: Unnecessary?

The sudden power loss
55 and a half seconds

after the alarm was
triggered suggests

that the intruder cut
the power from your home.

Now, this is your
home. Correct sir?

Drew: That's what I've
been trying to tell you.

Barry: Now you
wouldn't want your home

invaded and you BTK'd
while you slept.

Would you?

Drew: BTK'd?

Barry: Bind, Torture, Kill.

Now is that what you want sir?

Because if that is what you want

then I'll pack up my
stuff and I'll go.

Didn't think so.

Now, if you'll let me continue

until everything is clear

I'll be out of your hair
in no time. (trips) Sheez!

(garage door opening)

Drew: I think everything
is fine really.

Barry: Shhh.

They like to hide in garages.

Drew: Who likes to
hide in garages?

Barry: I don't want to impart

that dark knowledge onto you.

Unless you never
want to sleep again.

(ominous music)

(ominous music)

Barry: Holy shoot!

Is this yours sir?

Drew: Listen man
it's a long story.

Barry: If this is yours,

then I'd like to
shake your hand.

I tell you I'm a
sucker for these

old vintage photo booths.

When I said sucker I mean
"obsessive freak." (laughs)

Yeah, Jerry and I, we always
say if we win the lotto

we're going to go on a
road trip and we're going

to find 50 of these from every
state in God's good nation.

Drew: Sounds cool,
yeah. Who's Jerry?

Barry: Jerry? My brother.

You know, he works
the nightshift.

Drew: Of course, yeah.

Barry: Oh come on. You've
got to have seen Jerry.

People say we look a lot
alike, which we don't.

I'm easier on the eyes. (laughs)

Yeah, it's always been
a dream, you know.

To have 50 of these
lovely ladies.

Clean them up, you know,

make them something real nice.

Drew: Yeah, got to have dreams.

Barry: Oh yeah.

Say, you're looking
to sell this baby?

Drew: NO! NO!

Barry: Geez louise!

Yeah, I get it. It's a beaut.

No reason to sell,
but no reason to yell.

Yeah. Could use a
little scrub though.

Drew: Yeah.

Drew: What? Oh yeah, those
are just some friends

that's consensual
everyone's kind of

handabout the parameters

of [unintelligible]

Barry: All right sir.

The garage appears to be clear.

Drew: Good, uh, great, uh,

so thank you for securing it.

Barry: It's my job

and I know you might feel safe,

but remember if a sick
psycho wants to get inside

he can if he really wants to.

That was a close one.

I tell you, sir, if I had a
dime for every time I (falls)

Drew: Shit man!
Oh God. You okay?

wind knocked out of you

that makes you kind of -

(leaking sound - ominous music)

Drew: Oh! Oh! Oh! No!

(phone ringing)

Kamal's voice: You've
reached Kamal with SlicePro.

Leave a message. (Beep)

Drew: Hey again, Kamal.
Sorry to bother you,

but listen we have
a problem here.

Um, rather a second problem.

Um, actually the first
one is completely missing,

you know, so maybe
we only have one

to deal with now, that
would be good. Right?

Or maybe not. Um,
anyway I'm not, uh,

not really sure what to do here

so just call me back
please. Oh my God!

(ominous music)

(dog bell tinkling)


(ominous music)

Allan: Lance Bryant?

Drew: Whoa! (coughs) Holy shit.

Allan: Lance Bryant?

It is a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

Drew: Yeah, that's great, uh,

but I'm not, I'm not Lance.

Allan: You're not Lance Bryant?

Drew: No.

Allan: This is what
you're telling me.

Drew: Look, this, this
is Lance, this picture

it's the guy with
the horse head on.

I'm pretty sure
that's his torso.

I don't why the
(breathing heavy) yeah.

My name is Drew.

I'm just kind of
taking care of things

while he's out of town.

Allan: You haven't seen or heard

anything about, uh,
a girl. Have you?

Drew: Uh?

Allan: A young girl who
may or may not have been

here in one form or another.

Drew: Wait a
second. Who are you?

And why, why are you here?

Allan: Who I am
is not important.

How I got in here is
even less important.

What is important is
that a very important man

is looking for his very
important granddaughter

who he believes Lance Bryant

has been in contact with.

Drew: Well, um, yeah I don't,

I don't know anything
about a granddaughter.

Allan: If she, or Lance Bryant,
come by while you're here

this very important
man that I speak of

would see to it that
you're handsomely rewarded.

If you would provide him
with helpful information.

Use this to do so.

Drew: Plateau Pines
Retirement Community.

Allan: He will make you an offer

you will not excuse, refuse.

He will make you an offer
you will not refuse.

Vik: Well?

Allan: Your granddaughter
isn't in there.

Lance Bryant isn't in there.

Vik: What do you mean?

Lance Bryant wasn't in there?

Allan: Some other guy was,

Drew something. He said
Lance Bryant is out of town.

This is Lance Bryant.

Vik: I hate to think what that

deviant would do
with my Katrina.

All right, all right,
we'll, we'll wait.

We'll sit here and
wait for my Katrina

or for that sick son
of a bitch to show up.

Even if it takes all night.

Allan: Boss, I got to have
the fun bus back by three.

Vik: Oh all right, all right,

Jesus Christ let's take it back.

We'll come back after
dark. All right?

Let's get moving.
Let's get moving.

Traffic is going to be a cunt.

(drives away)

Kamal: Drew! Drew! I'm back.

Kamal: What the fuck?

Why did you put her in there?

Drew: I wish I had. It
would make more sense.

(dog barking)

Kamal: I guess it
could be worse.

(open shed door - ominous music)

Kamal: Should have
thought of this sooner.

We should call the cops.

Drew: Are you crazy?

Did you see the guy in the shed?

Kamal: Yeah, and that
was an accident. Right?

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: Then what's the problem?

Drew: You know maybe
if you were here

instead of out selling knives

on your little bicycle

you might have
seen what happened.

Kamal: Well, take it easy man.

I was trying to
solve the problem

that we discussed last night

or were you too blacked
out to remember?

Drew: No, I had like four beers.

I wasn't blacked out.

Kamal: Four beers, right.

Drew: Yeah four beers.

Kamal: Uh-hum, you
had four more beers

and then you had
four more beers.

Drew: Nope.

Kamal: And then you
had all those shots

to go with each and
every one of those beers.

Drew: I think, I think,
I think I remember.

(phone ringing)

Kamal: Yep. Uh yeah.
Yes sir. Uh, one second.

Drew: Hello.

Spencer: Drew. Who
the fuck was that?

Drew: Uh, hey Mr. Bryant, Lance.

It was, it was no one.

Lance: What the fuck
you mean? No one?

Don't fuck with me.

Who the fuck is in my house?

Drew: It's no big deal,

just some door-to-door
knife salesman.

Kamal: Junior sales associate.

Spence: You know what?

Go get the pellet gun
and shoot that bitch.

Drew: I don't know Lance.

He seems like a
good guy, you know.

Lance: Of course he
seems like a good guy.

Bitch probably works
on 100% commission.

Get the pellet gun
and shoot his ass.

Drew: You know what?

I think he's actually leaving.

Um, so yeah, I wouldn't
want to waste a pellet.

So nothing to worry about.

Spencer: No, no, no,
it's not all good.

Success suckers need
to learn a lesson.

Shoot him. Damn it!
Shoot his ass now Drew.

Drew: (shoots Kamal)

Spencer: There
you go. Good work!

Now listen. That hot little
package come for me yet?

Drew: Uh, no.

Spencer: Damn.

Might have slipped by
with everything else

that shows up at the house.

Drew: No, no. I'm pretty sure

we would have noticed
something that special.

Spencer: We? Who the fuck is we?

Drew: Uh, me and Mr.
Baldwin, you know.

The only two people here.

Spencer: Mr. Baldwin
is not a person Drew.

Drew: Yes sir. Mr.
Baldwin is not a person.

Spencer: Listen, you just
keep your eye out. OK?

And if she shows up

you just toss her
in the master suite.

Hell, for that matter,
even in the garage is fine.

Ha, you know, she can't
complain. (laughs)

Anyway, I am about to go

and get my wine tasting on Drew.

I will talk to you tomorrow.

(ominous music)

Drew: What the fuck
are we going to do?

Kamal: Lucky you didn't
break the skin asshole.

Drew: We need to

Kamal: I need to pull
up my ass out of here

before you shoot me again
you fucking lunatic.

Pretty good. Huh?

Lance doesn't know what the
original box looks like.

She could have come in
these styrofoam coolers

just as easily as
the cardboard box.

Drew: Okay, there's no way she's
fitting in one of these things.

Kamal: Yeah, but
she'll fit in both.

I know you weren't impressed

by my SlicePro demonstration,

but trust me the
blades are legit.

By my calculations
it will take, like,

5 to 10 minutes to
completely slice her body.

Drew: Okay, Okay, Okay.
I get it. I get it.

Yeah, and that's exactly
what we shouldn't do.

Kamal: Why not?

If we don't do something

we're the ones who are
going to be fucked.

Drew: No Lance, Lance
won't let that happen.

Not if we, not if we
take care of this,

like, rationale and
civilized human beings.

Not like this.

Kamal: Drew, Lance doesn't
give a fuck about you.

Drew: Okay, Okay.
Number two. Focus.

Okay. Aim for
something specific.

Impatience is the forerunner
of mother fuckin' failure.

(closes book)

Drew: These coolers
are an impatient move.

Okay? So, so we'll get
her back into the garage

and together we'll go find
something that actually works.

Kamal: I'm telling you man.

A box that size that
isn't already filled

with a refrigerator
or a water heater

is impossible to find.

Drew: You probably didn't check

a furniture store. Did you?

I'm not saying it's
your fault, or anything,

it's just, it just
takes a certain mindset

to achieve success.

Kamal: What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

Drew: Well it means
like back in school,

for example, you
know, you typically

settled for the easiest
way out of things.

You know, I mean,
you transferred.

Things got difficult
and you transferred

and I'm not saying
it's your fault.

It's just, it's just
the way you're wired.

Kamal: The way I'm wired?

What about you man?

What about you jumping
ship on your fucking job?

You don't fucking
get it. Do you?

Fuck you man.

This is your fucking problem.

Drew: Seriously? Oh my God.



(car doors shut)






Drew: (grunting)

Katie: DREW!


Katie: Drew!


Drew: (sighs)



Katie: What the fuck?



(shuts car door - squish)


Kamal: Oh hey, you're a ...

Spencer: Spencer Shaw.

Spencer: That's right.
We met earlier.

Spencer: Yes, and you're
one of the young gentlemen

that's house sitting for Lance.

Is that right?

Kamal: Oh no. I'm
not house sitting.

I'm never house
sitting over there.

Spencer: That's right,
of course, of course.

Then it was your friend
that's watching his place?

Kamal: Look, Drew
is not my friend.

Spencer: Really? I wasn't
under that impression.

I thought the two of
you were peas in a pod.

Kamal: No, we never were.

Spence: Well then,
what brings you by ...

Kamal: Kamal.

Spencer: Kamal. Excellent name.

Kamal with a K. Uh,

Those who tribal
among the mountains

see themselves
within themselves.

What brings you by
Kamal? A box. (laughs)

Drew: What the fuck
am I going to do?

(phone ringing)

Drew: (breathing heavy)

Katie: So, you'll
invite other girls

to this swanky ass
pad you're watching,

but not your own
girlfriend. Huh?

Drew: What are
you talking about?

Katie: Who the fuck is she dude?

Drew: Who's who?

Katie: The geisha
slutty anorexic slut

who's probably still strung out

on your goddamn couch.

Drew: Anorexic geisha slut?

Katie: You know what I mean.

I thought that we
were good, you know,

I thought that we
were on the good path.

Drew: Listen, can we, can we

just talk about this later?

It's just I'm in the middle
of fixing something major

right now and I could
lose out on much more

than the job if I don't
figure it out quickly.

Katie: No, that's fine. You go.

No-no, you just go, you
go and you do this shit,

okay and you just,
you get the job.

You, you know, you'll
just have, you'll have

plenty of time to
devote to Lance

without me inconveniencing you.

Drew: Can we maybe
talk about this

when you're not drunk?

Katie: Fuck you. Fuck
you fuckin' Drew, you -

Drew: (sighs)

Drew: Where the hell
is he getting this?

Agent Granger:

Sorry. Did I startle you?

Seemed like I
startled you there.

Nobody was answering
the front door

so I just thought I'd
come around the side gate.

I hope that's okay Mr. Bryant.

Drew: I'm not Lance Bryant.

How many times do I
have to tell you people?

Agent Granger: How
many of us people

have been by here already?

Drew: Wait. Who,
who are you exactly?

Agent Granger:
Exactly? Edwin Granger.

Immigration and Customs.

Mr. Bryant on the premises?

Drew: Well, uh, Lance,
Mr. Bryant, is out,

out of town that is.

Agent Granger: Umm,

How convenient. For
him, not for me.

Drew: Is he in some
kind of trouble?

Agent Granger: Has he mentioned
anything about a young woman?

Drew: Uh, no.

Spencer: Very impressive Kamal.

Very impressive indeed.

Kamal: Yeah, SlicePro
does not fuck around.

Spence: No, it does
not fuck around.

It's not fucking around
in my hand. Is it?

Kamal and Spencer: (laughing)

Spencer: That feels
so good. (chop)

So tell me.

What is it that you and Drew

Kamal: What?

I'm just curious. I have
a curious bone in me.

Two young men in that house.

All that luxury at
your fingertips.

All the opulence.

Kamal: You know, I can throw in

a pair of scissors that
can cut through a penny.

Spence: (chop) You've
done it again Kamal.

I'll take it. All the
knives and the case.

Kamal: No shit.

Spencer: But before we settle up

I'm going to need to medicate.

Kamal: Medicate?

Drew: Human trafficking.

Agent Granger: Yeah, but
not your run of the mill

hop on the pick-up over the
border kind of bullshit either.

We're talking ... I
can't get into details,

but I'm just going
to tell you this

it's a global
trafficking organization

that specializes in
sexual exploitation.

Are you familiar
with sex slavery?

Drew: You mean like
mail order brides?

Agent Granger: No, I don't
mean mail order brides.

Mail order brides they enter
that stuff in by choice.

Companies like ForeignFlames.com

are actually sanctioned.

They got sponsors.

They got a website
and a web master.

I'm talking about women,
children, and men,

men like you and me having sex

against our free will.

You and I in a room
performing Caesar salad

on the side add the chicken.

If you know what I mean?

That's a position.

That's an elicit position
that's very common now

and has been since 1997.

Drew: No way. Not,
not, not Lance.

No, he's a pillar
of the community.

You know, on the "Forty
under 40" list, twice.

Agent Granger: Huh!
Fifth grade merit badge.

Ninth grade, I put a salamander
into a microwave oven.

People change.

Spencer: Are you
enjoying my robe?

Kamal: It's quite nice.

Spencer: Please partake.

Kamal: No, I probably shouldn't.

Spencer: You probably should.

It's grade A Kamal.
It's very medicinal.

You see as a professor at
a top tier medical school

I'm awarding certain,
um, best to say this,

benefits, no, no, boons rather

that other people like
yourself aren't accustomed to.

So please, please partake.

Allow me. Yes, very good Kamal.

That's it. Now
it's working well.

Very good yes.

Kamal: (coughs)

Spencer: Very good.

Now, where were we?

Oh, I remember.

You were telling me

what you were doing
over at the house.

Kamal: Was I?

Spencer: Yes, you were.

Spencer: Yes you were.

You see from my place very
difficult for me to see,

but I thought, I
thought possibly

that you might have
had company over there.

Kamal: Company?

Spencer: Yes company.

That's right.
Tick-tock you're fine.

Company. That's right.

You see I have a poor
vantage point from my place.

But I thought possibly,
just possibly you might

have had a young woman
over at the house.

Kamal: (feels sick)

Spencer: Oh-oh,
oh-oh, all right now.

Drew: What is this?

Agent Granger: That
was a wire transfer

from Lance's account to
an account in the Ukraine.

And you know what the
Ukraine's chief exports are?

Weapons grade plutonium and

hot white pasty Euro ass.

Drew: Looks, looks
like a lot of figures.

Agent Granger: Yeah, yeah,

people with a lot of figures

tend to do a lot of
questionable things.

Look, I'm not saying that
Lance is involved directly

I'm just saying that somebody

very close to him may be.

What's the old saying go? Hmm?

Good friend help you move,

great friend help you
move a body. Exactly.

He's a powerful man.
He's got a lot of pull.

You have him call me
when he gets back. OK?

By the way, um, do
you have anybody

who can stay with you
while you're here?

You know, if Lance is involved

with what we think
he is involved with,

there is no telling
who might turn up here.

You know, like a good
friend you can trust?

Drew: Yeah, I don't, I
don't really have anyone.

Agent Granger: Yeah,
I didn't think so.

Spencer: (claps hands)

Look, I'm prying.

I shouldn't be prying.

Kamal: You shouldn't be prying.

Spencer: No, I
shouldn't be prying,

but I do want to remind you

this whole area here
everything here,

this is a neighborhood, hey,

this is a neighborhood
watch zone.

Kamal: Huh! You're the neighbor?

Spencer: I'm the
neighbor. (laughs)

Look at me the
big neighbor here.

I'm the neighbor
and I want to know

who she was and how she ended up

on your doorstep?

Now I'm not saying that
she came there for you.

I'm not even saying
that you knew

that she came in the
first place. Uh-hum.

It's clear to me that Drew

is the one that's in charge.

Kamal: Drew's an asshole.

Spencer: Yes he is.

Kamal: Mother fucker.

Spencer: Mother fucker.

Kamal: Mother fucker
is one cold bastard.

Spencer: One cold bastard.

What are you saying Kamal?

Are you saying that Drew

is capable of cold,
unspeakable acts?

Kamal: Shit yeah.

The guy is heartless.

Nothing is good enough for him.

Nobody is worthy of
being in his presence.

Spencer: Hmm, a cowboy.

You're saying
there's a little bit

of a cowboy in him.

Are you telling me that

the basic fundamental principles

of life don't apply to him?

Kamal: Principles?

Spencer: Principles.

Kamal: I could go on
about the principles.

Spencer: Go on about
the principles.

Look at you. You're distraught.

There's a war raging
inside of you right now.

You've got to battle it.

us that in our inner self

that there is a
war, a raging battle

we need to free ourselves.

Free yourself.

What were you doing
in the house Kamal?

Yes, the battle.

Kamal: War

Spencer: Yes, tell me
what you were doing

inside of the house, Kamal?

Yes, Kamal, yes.

Kamal: I got to puke.

Spencer: Not on my robe.




Drew: OW!


Spencer: Kamal, how
are you feeling?

I have a fine, fine cup of
Earl Grey with your name on it.

Kamal (hisses)

Drew: (blinded and stumbles)

(ominous music)

Drew: Marta. Oh,
Marta. Oh my God.

Oh, not you too. Marta
(crying hysterically)

Marta: I don't
know what happened.

don't tell Mr. Lance.

My children, I
have many children.

I promise Mr. Lance not
to sleep no more at work,

but my children.

I have many children.

I get sleepy. Please.

Drew: (Sighs)

Everybody, everybody
around me is just dropping,

you know, Marta, they're
just dropping like flies

like everyone I'm
close to they're just,

they're just leaving
me and I saw you

and I thought what -

I'm so fucked right now Marta.

Everything is completely
falling apart.

Everything I've tried
it just fucks up,

you know, I'm so fucked.

I'm such a fuck. (crying)

Marta: It's going
to be okay Mr. Drew.

It's going to be
okay. Get up. Get up.

Drew: I'm too much
of a fuck. (crying)

Marta: Sometimes you
must break things apart

in order to put
it back together.

I must do sometimes
with the toilet

when it clogs up with crap.

Drew: The crap? Huh? What?

Marta: Yeah today. I
have to clog it up.

Drew: Oh.

Marta: It's okay, it's okay.

You gonna be okay.

Drew: It's okay Marta.
I'm good. I'm good.

(Music - birds singing)

(Music - birds singing)

Kamal: Hey man.

It's pretty fascinating. Huh?

Kamal: Yeah, "War Maiden."

Spencer: Huh?

Kamal: The name of the
movie we shot in school.

It was "Apocalypse Now"
meets "Breakfast Club,"

is how we pitched it.

Drew: That's right.

Kamal: The death
scene off the roof?

Classic.

Drew: Yeah, I saw scars
from those homemade squibs.

It sucks you left man.

Could have made a
ton more of those.

Kamal: Do you even know
why I transferred Drew?

You remember when
you and your friends

fucked with my family.

Chris Arnold, Bobbie
Barnes, Brett Kendle.

I know you were with them.

Drew: I was 15.

Kamal: We were best friends.

Do you even know what it's
like to be stabbed in the back?

Drew: I'm sorry man. I am.

If I had known how much
that, that hurt you

I, I would have ...

Kamal: Yeah.

Drew: Those guys were a
bunch of fucking dicks man.

I don't know why I
hung out with them.

I, I'm sure they've all
gained about 100 pounds.

Kumal: Yeah, 150 pounds.

Drew: Yeah, probably
still all hanging out.

Kamal: Probably.

Drew: Probably still
going to the high school

football games on
Saturdays [unintelligible]

Kamal: (laughs) (sighs)

Drew: Look man I
think you actually

might be right about Lance.

He's just, it's just
nothing adds up,

you know, him leaving
town and all these

random people stopping by.

This whole thing has
gotten so out of control.

Kamal: Yeah, but it's
your dream job man.

Drew: There's other
jobs, you know.

The point is a job
with Lance isn't going

to mean anything if I
end up going to jail.

Kamal: So what are you saying?

Drew: I'm saying let's do it.

Your way this time.

Kamal: Sure?

Drew: Yeah, I, I can't
do it without you.

Kamal: So the third and final
principle of success is effort.

No one gets nowhere
without 120% effort.

Take the the biggest
and best shots possible.

Go big or go the fuck home.

Drew: Just tell
me how to proceed.

Kamal: First off, I'm going to
need you to prep the stables.

Drew: Prep it for what?

Kamal: Blood Drew.

The're going to
be a lot of blood.

While you're doing that
I'll be prepping the tools.

We're going to need the
best to pull this off.

SlicePro. Like I
said, the shits legit.

(sharpening knives)



Kamal: We'll need to burn
everything that isn't flesh.

Anything physical that can
connect back to them we burn.

Drew: [unintelligible] we
chopped up we can't burn those.

Kamal: Got to
dispose of it here.

Drew: How?


(ominous music)

(ominous music)

Kamal: You can do this man.

Just let the blades do the work.

(thump from knife)

Dead Girl: Screams

Kamal: Did you hear me?

Just let the blades do the work.

Drew: Yeah, yeah. Let
the blades do the work.

(ominous music - chopping)

(ominous music - chopping)

(ominous music)

(ominous music)

Spencer: Uh!

(ominous music)

Vik: Uh, we don't know
what's going on inside there.

Here, we better go in heavy.

Allan: Heavy?

Vik: Heavy.

When are you going to understand
the fucking' lingo Allan?

This isn't Shakespeare.

You want me to say weaponry?

(chopping and hammering)

(chopping and hammering)

Kamal: Dude, everything okay?

Drew: Yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

Kamal: I hate to bring you down,

but we got a problem.

Mr. Baldwin won't eat.

Drew: What?

Kamal: Yeah and he's being

a real picky bitch about it too.

Drew: Oh wait. I think
I know what to do.


Mmmm. You don't know what
you're missing Mr. Baldwin.

It's so good Mr. Baldwin.

You don't know what
you're missing man.

great. Right Kamal?

Kamal: Uh.

Drew: (gagging) So good.

Kamal: Oh, Mmmm, Oh
yeah, I've never had

such divine human before.

Drew: Mmmm, so tender, juicy.

You should try it
Mr. Baldwin. Come on.

Mr. Baldwin: (Eating)

Drew: There you
go. Good, good boy.

Oh thank God. Oh fuck.

Kamal: It's so nice in my hands.

Drew: Dude you can stop.

He's eating, he's
eating, come on.

Drew: Okay, so we'll
have a drink while

Mr. Baldwin is eating.

Clean up anything left
and then call it a day.

(ominous music)

Katrina: Lance? Lance Bryant?

I here to make wife.

Drew: Oh.

Katrina: (Ukrainian) Katrina.

Drew: Can you, can you
give us a second? Please.

Just one second. Yeah.

What? Please, just
back up a little bit.

Um, just move, yeah just.

Kamal: We're not
talking about you.

Drew: Nope. Thank
you. What the fuck?

Kamal: If that's Lance's girl
who the fuck did we chop up?

Drew: I don't know man.

I should have called the
police to start with.

What the fuck was I thinking?

Kamal: What the hell
are you talking about?

I'm the one who wanted
to call the police.

You're the one
obsessed with this job.

Drew: I just wanted to box
her back up the way she was.

You're the one who
wanted to fuckin'

Now we dismembered her
body for no reason.

Kamal: Two actually.

Drew: Two bodies.
We're so fucked.

Kamal: No it's okay. We're okay.

Drew: How are we okay?

Kamal: We took care
of one girl. Right?

Drew: And the security guard.

Kamal: Any evidence is gone.

Drew: Yeah-yeah.

Kamal: And now
Lance's girl showed up

so we're golden.

Drew: How are we golden?

Kamal: We're clear man.

We never bring up the bodies.

Drew: Of course not.

Kamal: Lance gets his girl

and nobody goes to jail.

Everybody wins.

Drew: Yeah,
everybody wins, yeah.

Kamal: Now let's get back to her

before she dies of boredom

and we have to chop her up too.

Kamal: Twosome?

Kamal: Ready?

Drew and Kamal: Hi.

Katrina: Hello.

Drew: We have been
expecting you. Yeah?

Kamal: Yeah.

Katrina: Lance?

Drew and Kamal:
No, no, not Lance.

Katrina: Knwet?

Katrina: Lance?

Kamal: No, I'm not Lance either.

I really want to
be, but I'm not.

Drew: Um, oh, oh,
actually that's Lance.

Um, the man in the picture.

Katrina: Lance?

Drew: In the woods,
yep, that's Lance.

Kamal: Tak.

Drew: So Lance will
be here tomorrow.

Um, so you'll stay
the night here

and then tomorrow
you'll see Lance.

Kamal: You look thirsty sweetie.

You want some vodka?

Katrina: Vodka?

Katrina: Oh, tak.

Drew: Yeah, yeah.

Drew: Yeah, that's a great idea.

Um, so he, he's going
to take you to the bar

in the kitchen
and get you some -

Kamal: Vodka.

Katrina: Vodka? Lance?

Drew: No, he, Kamal will

and then I'll
carry your suitcase

down to the master suite.

Kamal: Yes. Oh, right
this way my lady.

Please we go.

We can talk about Gorbachev.

Drew: Nice to meet you Katrina.

Kamal: Oh, what is that red
spot on Gorbachev's head?

(Knocking and doorbell ringing)

Drew: Hi.

Woman: You live here?

Drew: No actually.

I'm just looking after the
place for the guy that does.

Woman: Okay. How
long you been here?

Drew: I guess this will
be my second night.

Woman: So you were
here yesterday?

Drew: Can I help
you with something?

Woman: These look familiar
you son of a bitch?

They're dollars.

Drew: Yeah.

Drew: Yeah, I see that
they're dollar bills.

Woman: Yeah.

Drew: Three of them.

Woman: These are the
exact dollar bills

that you used to
swindle my scouts

out of four boxes of thin mints.

Uh-huh, yeah, remembering now?

Four boxes that are
three-fifty each.

Drew: Huh! You're right.
I think you're right.

I'm sorry. I probably
miscounted. It was -

Woman: You think you can rip
off my girls, huh? (punches)

You think just
'cause they're girls

you can just ... your bad ass

can get a discount on some
cookies. (punches three times)

Yeah, uh-huh, somebody
order a pizza?


Drew: Listen lady
it was a busy day.

I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

Woman: Yeah I appreciate
you calling me a lady.

I appreciate that, okay,

but you know what?

You weren't thinking.

You weren't thinking
that those troops

also had an amateur mixed
martial artist as a leader.

Woman: Throw down.

Drew: I didn't know that.

Woman: Throw down.

Drew: I didn't know
that. I'm sorry.

I haven't opened the
cookies yet. Okay?

I'm [unintelligible] for
you. There's three boxes.

You can take them with you.

Woman: You think I
want those cookies?

Look at me. Look at
me in the eyeballs.

I don't want your
fucking cookies.

Not after you had your
little hands over them

your little baby hands.

Did you ever work
a day in your life?

Those thin mints used
to have dazzle in them

now they got your little
baby hands on them.

Drew: Okay.

Woman: Your man juice.

Drew: Okay, okay, what
do you want from me then?

Woman: You know what I want?

Woman: I want you to pay
me back [unintelligible]

for those cookies
that you stole. Okay?

Yeah. Full reimbursement.

Plus you're going
to reimburse me

for the mileage
that it took for me

to drive my SUV all the way over

to this well-heeled
neighborhood.

Drew: That's not a problem.

Woman: Oh good. Good.
Shake your head yes.

Shake your head yes.

Drew: My wallet is over there.

You can take whatever you want.

Woman: Good, good.

Drew: Then please leave.

Woman: I got a date
tonight with a guy.

Drew: Just take
the whole wallet.

Woman: All right, all right.

Woman: I got [unintelligible]
for that pussy.

Drew: Actually on second thought

you can go fuck yourself
and fuck your cookies too.

Because they taste like shit.

Woman: Oh, okay.

Woman: Okay, yeah, yeah.

Drew: Now listen. Turn around.

Drew: Walk out that door.

Woman: Okay, which way do I go?

Drew: Out the door. Okay?

Drew: Okay, you got it? (falls)

Woman: Yeah, I got it.

Woman: Yeah, you're saying
something about my cookies?

Drew: (grunting)

Vik: What the fuck
is going on here?

That, that, that piece of
shit you're stepping on

sister he belongs to me.

Woman:This piece of
shit owes me money.

Vik: He owes me a
lot more than that.

Woman: Yeah, well you're going

to have to wait in line gramps.

Vik: Uh, but I don't
like waiting in lines.

Now look, hon, I got to
ask this, this asshole

some questions about
my granddaughter.

Then you can have what's left.

Drew: Look man.

I don't know anything about
your granddaughter. OK?

I'm just the house sitter.

Vik: Oh, you're going
to lie to me now.

Vik: Fuck, I want to
know how you assholes

got possession of
my granddaughter.

Kamal: I already told
Jubakka over here

she showed up on her
own like 20 minutes ago

you fucking idiots.

Alan: Watch your mouth Gandhi.

Vik: Allan take it easy.

Agent Granger: All right.
Everyone freeze. DIC.

The house sitter
is coming with me.

Woman: Oh, what did
he do to screw you up?

Agent Granger: Does
it concern you?

I'm here for him
and Lance Bryant.

Katrina: Lance?

Vik: Look, look, look,

I don't know who you.

I don't know what you want,

but I need a little time

to have some conversation

with these two jerks here about,

about my granddaughter

and then you can do
whatever you want with them.

Agent Granger: Holy shit.
You're Victor Koslav.

aka Big Vik Koslav,
aka Big Bad Wolf Koslav

aka Wolf Face.

Vik: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

you heard about me. Huh?

Agent Granger: Yeah, thought you
were out of this game years ago.

Vik: I'm staging a comeback now,

but first I want
to get some answers

from these two idiots.

Agent Granger: Actually
Vik, you know what?

You're coming with me, too.

Vik: I don't think so.

Allan: Officer, we will make
you an offer you cannot refuse.

Vik: Allan.

Agent Granger: Let the girl go

and tell your man
to lower his weapon.

Vik: I can't go with you

because that was one of
my plans for a comeback.

Agent Granger:
Actually, you know what?

You're coming with me.

Everybody is going with me

into a big, fucking,
happy van downtown.

We're going to sort it all
out with [unintelligible]

What the?

Security Officer Jerry: Hey sir.

Agent Granger: Hey, hey.

Security Officer
Jerry: Who's to say

you even have jurisdiction
in these parts?

Agent Granger: I'm with
the federal government.

I have jurisdiction
in every part.

Security Officer Jerry:
Every suit tells me that.

Vik: Who the hell are you?

Security Officer Jerry:
Jerry, Vault Home Security.

Barry, my brother, he's
been missing all day.

While people don't say
we look a lot alike,

but we do we're
easy on the eyes.

Have any of you seen my brother?

Agent Granger: Tell you what.

How about you help me
wrangle these people. OK?

Then we can look for Jerry.

Security Officer Jerry: Barry.

Agent Granger: Have you
checked [unintelligible]

Security Officer Jerry:
Do you have a warrant?

Agent Granger: No.

Security Officer Jerry: Yeah,
you don't have a warrant.

All right. Since you
don't have a warrant

I'm going to have to ask you

to vacate Lance Bryant's house.

Marta: Mr. Lance no home now.

Vik: Who are you?

Marta: I clean your
room now Mr. Drew.

Oh, I clean later.

Agent Granger: That's
a good idea Miss.

We clean later.

Woman: Thought you
learned your lesson?

Drew: Fuck.

Agent Granger: Hey ma'am, I
need you to hold it right there.

Woman: Maybe I should
grab it myself.

And fuck off your
nut bag with it.

You know what?

Take you dick and shove it up

where your mom fuckin' put it.

Agent Granger:
Don't do that ma'am.

Ma'am do not touch that. MA'AM!


Kamal: What the fuck was that?

Drew: I don't know man.

Kamal: Are you okay?

Drew: Yeah, fine. Are you?

Kamal: Yeah.

Kamal: Is it still
considered a Mexican shootout

if there aren't any
Mexicans involved?

Drew: What?

Kamal: I guess Marta
was here for a second.

Drew: (breathing heavy)

Agent Granger: You
guys want to tell me

what the fuck that was about?

Drew: Honestly, I have no idea.

Everyone showed up
at the same time

looking for someone
else and I don't know.

Agent Granger: Well the girl
she's with Lance. Right?

I mean she's here
with the sex ring

the whole time he's
involved in all that.

Drew: No, she was
here by choice.

I'm pretty sure.
She gave me this.

Agent Granger: Look, I'm
going to need a statement. OK?

I need you to come down
and make a statement

because if what you say is true

it would really help
in clearing Lance -

Drew: Behind you.

Agent Granger: (shoots Vik)

Drew: Oh, oh,

Agent Granger: You know what?

Fuck the statement.

Drew: Yeah, fuck the statement.

Agent Granger: I don't
need a statement.

Agent Granger: Yeah
because we're going to have

to take the fuckers off of
Lance right now so just -

Drew: (breathing heavily)

we'll just forget
about the statement.

Agent Granger: Yeah I know.

Kamal: You'll take
care of them, too.

Agent Granger: What?

Kamal: The bodies?

You'll take care
of the bodies too.

Agent Granger: Do I look
like a fucking warlock?


Drew: All right.

Should probably start
prepping the stables.

Those bodies aren't going
to dismember themselves.

Kamal: Five more minutes.

Let's try and appreciate this
shit for five more minutes.

Drew: Yeah, you're
right. Five more minutes.

Spencer: Two-faced bastards.

Drew: Oh!

Spencer: Listen Kamal.

I thought you and
I were friends.

I thought you and I created
a special relationship.

Until I found this.

Uh-hum. I knew you were
keeping her from me.

I just knew it.

Kamal: We thought
she was Lances.

Believe me.

We totally would have gotten her

the fuck out of here if
we knew she was yours.

Trust me.

Drew: Yeah.

Spencer: Just because something

is delivered to you by mistake

that doesn't give you
the right to open it up.

Now Kamal knows
that I'm a professor

that's accustomed
to certain boons

or benefits rather

that aren't awarded to
other people easily.

One such is my
exclusive membership

to a harvested organ
exchange program.

Drew: A harvested what?

Spencer: Yeah, it may
not be 100% legal,

but raw cadavers are
prime for research.

And this woman died
of natural causes.

I assure you.

Then she donated
herself to science.

But she also cost
20 thousand dollars.

So gentlemen, please tell me

that you have her
well refrigerated.

Drew: Oh.

Kamal: Yeah, about that.

Spencer: What?

Drew: Well we really did it
with the best intentions.

Spencer: You did what?

Kamal: We chopped her up.

Drew: Fed her to Mr. Baldwin.

Spencer: You're telling
me you destroyed her.

You destroyed her. (sighs)

Guys you owe me 20 grand.

Drew: Oh.

Kamal: We don't have
that kind of money.

Spencer: Fine. Let's get
Lance to help you get it.

I'm sure he will
once I explain to him

what irresponsible house
guests you've been.

Kamal: Spencer you can't.

Drew would lose everything
if Lance ever found out.

Spencer: I don't give a shit.

Drew: Actually Kamal, I
think I have a solution.

Spencer: I don't
have time to waste.

Drew: Yeah, I think
you're going to be happy.

Will this do?

Spencer: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Guys you have no idea the
work I can do with these.

Come on in. (kisses them)
Come on in you guys.

You guys. Okay, I
got to get them home.

Get them on ice ASAP.

(Music - birds singing)

Kamal: Sure you don't
need me to stay?

Drew: Oh no, it's
cool man, okay.

I think I can probably
handle it from here.

Thanks Kamal.

Kamal: Kam.

Drew: Good seeing you man.

Kamal: You too man.

Kamal: You did it.

Kamal: (sighs) It's time
for me to sell these knives.

Drew: (chuckles)
I know you will.

Kamal: Yeah, talk soon.

Drew: Yeah.

Kamal: [unintelligible]

Kamal: [unintelligible]

Drew: Oh! No!

Drew: I know it
all sounds crazy,

impossible even,
and if I were you

I'd have a hard time
believing it myself.

But I've changed from
this whole experience.

I really have.

At one time in my
life, back home maybe,

you could say I was
only a caterpillar

and on my journey
here I was in a cocoon

and I now I can confidently
say the cocoon has hatched.

I am now a butterfly.

A beautiful and fully
developed butterfly

that's ready to fly

and at the end of the day

I need [unintelligible]

so thank you Lance.

Your kind generosity
is what allowed me

to escape my sad,
unfulfilled existence,

one previously
destined for solitude,

a collision course, if you will,

threatened by peril and torture.

It's because of
you that my world

is suddenly wide open
with opportunity,

opportunity and freedom,

freedom from the
chains that bind me.

Like 911, I will never forget,

never forget what
you have done for me.

I know it isn't much,

but please in my

and the contents
within as a token

of my appreciation.

I feel like even
though they're not me

they'll be able to
adequately comfort you

while I explore this country

as I was meant to explore it.

Farewell for now Lance.

You'll forever be in my heart.

Love always, Katrina.

Spencer: Fuck.

Drew: You know I hate to say it,

but it's probably for the best

you weren't here
when she stopped by.

Spencer: You said she was
here for five minutes. Huh?

Drew: Yeah, yeah,
just long enough

to give me the letter
and the suitcase.

Spencer: Just hope she
finds whatever it is

she's looking for.

Drew: Yeah.

Spencer: Why don't you
come on by tomorrow?

We'll talk about what it is

you're going to do
for me full-time.

Because Team Lance
could use a reliable

mother fucker like you Drew.

Drew: (sighs) Thank
you Mr. Bryant.

Uh, I really
appreciate that, I do.

Uh, but I think I'm
going to ride it out

at the furniture store a
while longer, you know.

Spencer: You're not
even curious about what

you would be doing or what
Team Lance is all about.

Drew: I've got a pretty
good thing going right now.

I don't need to jump ship
for another one quite yet.

Spencer: Okay Drew.
You're all right.

I mean you're a
reasonable mother fucker.

Hear what I'm saying?
