  Legend has it, that when the
         moon's full...

   ...you can still spot ole
          Pitchfork...

    ...wandering the woods.

 Young Corey: My dad says we're
    not suppose to play back
            here...

   ...He says a monster lives
             here.

              Run!

  You shoulda seen your face.

  Wincer: It's the worst thing
        I've ever seen.

 There's a legend around here,
that a farmer killed his family.

    Morgan: If you mess with
  Rayborn's daughter, you mess
      with the pitchfork.

  This is right outside of out
           perimeter.

Does anybody live out this way?

       I don't think so.

            (Cheers)

       (Chainsaw engine)

           (Screams)

         Run! Run! Run!

            No! No!

        (Scream in pain)

     Who the hell is that?

      I know who that is.

             Sorry.

        (Radio chatter)

   This shit doesn't happen.

  I mean we caught the fucking
    Boogie Man, or Dracula,
  or hell, the devil himself.

You understand what I'm saying?
 - Yeah, you guys grow 'em big,
   and you grow 'em crazy...

      I'll give you that.

   Nah, it's more than that.

 Did you ever play that Bloody
 Mary game when you were kids?

 What where you stare into the
    mirror and say her name?

             Yeah.

          Yeah, sure.

 Did she ever come to life and
    start murdering people?

      I'm not trying to be
     insensitive, I'm not.

       It's just that...

when we was kids, growing up...

       He's the reason we
    didn't playin the woods.

       Those stories you
       tell each other...

  trying to keep each other up
    late at night at camp...

        were about him.
     - When you were a kid?

             Yeah.
  - Dang. That dude looks good
      for like, a hundred.

              Ha!

 I might have been a teenager,
     but you get my point.

  Why were you still going to
      camp as a teenager?

 It was vacation bible school.

       That's not weird!

    You know I saw him once,
      or I thought I did.

      We were working late
       on Christmas Eve.

     Car wreck, completely
      engulfed in flames.

      Couple lost control.

    Well it just felt weird.

   I don't know if it was the
      wind or the cold...

  or it was Christmas Eve and
I just didn't want to be there.

    (On Radio): Hey Wincer,
         what you got?

     I didn't really think
        about it then...

      but on the way home,
       from the scene...

       I passed right by
     the old Rayborn place.

 Well, I wouldn't have admitted
   then, but I'll tell you...

  scared the shit out of me...

    that some fucking crazy,
           old hermit

would've been that close to me,
    in the dark, at night...

   well, it'd scare anybody.

   Was Rayborn his real name?

             Yeah.

 'Til they started calling him
           Pitchfork.

Hey, if they can keep him alive,
  you're gonna need to put...

 ...a small army on his floor.

         Yeah, no shit.

Yeah, media's gonna be a bitch.

      I thought you meant
        if he wakes up.

  I don't believe in monsters.

             Fuck!

          (Screaming)

          (Screaming)

           (Grunting)

       Morgan: Let me ask
        you something...

     what do you think the
   chances are that Steven...

      would come work with
     us down on the boats?

            (Laughs)

   Well, let's see after you
        sold half our...

      ...gear to send him
        off to college.

Yeah. Does he have to know that?

  Morgan: It's good to see you
   boys back together again.

       You know I'd sell
     everything I own if...

     I thought there was a
       chance in hell...

   you'd wise up and get the
       hell out of here.

     Bring it on, alright.
         Alright buddy.

  (Whispering) They said like
  25 dead, including his dad.

  Oh my God. That's terrible.

       Make sure you give
     that to Dr. Shapiro...

      he needs it as soon
      as you can. Thanks.

      (Paramedic coughing)

           (Coughing)

             (Sobs)

  Steven hasn't come out yet?

            Not yet.

         He'll be fine.

  We use to play pretty rough
    when we were kids, so...

          he knows how
       to take a beating.

            (Laughs)

     I saw him tear up from
        a splinter once.

               Â¶

    Tiburon: It's called the
       Day of the Dead...

    (Speaking spanish), it's
     a time to remember...

 those that we've lost, and...

     the ones who have gone
         on before us.

    I've seen that on TV and
             stuff

 it's like a scary Mardi Gras,
             right?

       Yeah, pretty much.

            (Laughs)

      They didn't let you
       have the day off?

         I did not ask.

     Man, if I was Mexican,
  I wouldn't be working zombie
          Mardi Gras.

You know, that is disrespectful.

It's a celebration of a passing
 soul and to remind us that...

   life is just a dream, and
     death is when we wake.

       That's beautiful.

           Thank you.

   But, you have parades and
     throw candy too right?

       That's Mardi Gras.

        Woah woah, hey!

             Yeah?

        Where ya headed?

    Second floor, what's up?

         Is it urgent?

       Man, I'm at work!

      You got a minute to
        conference call?

 Didn't your ass just go smoke?

        Maybe, slow day.

You know, one of these days they
  gon' catch on to the fact...

    that you don't do shit!

            (Laughs)
      Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

Alright man, you twisted my arm.
    Yo Tiburon, you coming?

    Oh no, I get to get back
      to these checklists.

      Alright well, don't
      work too hard, man.

         He won't, it's
      mexican Mardi Gras.

            No shit?
       - I shit you not.

            Gringos.

           (Laughing)

   Mardi Gras, Cinco de Mayo,
      they got everything.

   Hey man look, who was that
    they brought in earlier?

    I don't know. They came
      in through the back.

       Through the morgue
        entrance right?

             Yeah.

              Why?

         I don't know.

  They did that shit that last
 time the mayor got his DUI...

         snuck his ass
      through the back...

    like I wasn't suppose to
       know who he is...

      shit, I know who the
      fuck he is. Ah Shit!

             What?

 Man, I gotta go back to the...

   break room, get my smokes.

    I'll bum you one, c'mon.

          Hell no man!
         You smoke that
      nasty menthol crap.

              So?
             - So?!

Dude that's full of fiberglass.
        That shit's way
       worse for you man.

    Oh. So it's more deadly
       than just smoking?
             Idiot.

          (Door Slams)
            (Grunts)

       (Noise continues)

             Shit.

         (Violent thud)

           Oh, sorry.
          - It's okay.

           You okay?

      Said might have some
        nerve damage...

      physical therapy...

          It'll be ok.
        Baby, baby, it's
         fine, really.

        Said it could've
        been alot worse.

       Has anyone checked
          you out yet?

          Not really.

       They want to check
      for a heartbeat, so.

   Did they do your CAT scan?

          No, not yet.

        Checking you for
        "dain bramage?"

            (Laughs)
      New "dain bramage."

     Have you..had a chance
     to talk to anyone yet?

         No, I gotta...

          go down and
      identify the... umm.

            Amanda?

  They towed that truck out of
    here about an hour ago.

 You know a bunch of kids head
  out here for some thrills...

       and end up in this
    crazy fucking nightmare.

 Whole thing turns my stomach.
      - You see that poor
     bastard in the woods?

        With the fucking
       thing on his face?
            - Yeah.

       Yeah, I saw it...

  I don't fucking believe it.

       I mean honestly...

       have you ever seen
      anything like this?

     Man, there ain't ever
    been anything like this.

          Lt. Dayton?

             Yeah?

    The city guys posted at
       the hospital said
 the ambulance isn't there yet.

You sure? They told everyone to
  else use the back entrance.

        He said they're
      covering both sides.

      They never made it.

    Ole Wincer could fuck up
 a cup of coffee, couldn't he?

  I'll tell you what, you tell
      them to stay put...

   in case they radio in, you
     follow me up the nine,
 see if we can chase them down.

     'Til we locate Wincer
    everyone reports to me.

       Wasn't sure if you
     were a coffee drinker.

      Only if it's Irish.

            Thanks.

          You know...

  I remember you from school.

           Fairhope?

          Go Pirates.

 Yeah, you were a couple grades
     ahead of me, but I...

        I saw you in the
        halls and stuff.

  You were in Steven's grade.

             Yeah.

      I didn't know him or
      anything, I just...

    Small school, you know?

          Yeah, tiny.

   You...you left before the
   year was over, didn't you?

  I'm not a stalker I promise,
              I...

          I just, uh.

  Yeah, I dropped out to help
      my dad on his boat.

       He was gonna lose
        it to the bank.

           I never...

             So...

     your dad, I mean he...

             Yeah.

              I...

          I wasn't...

           I'm sorry.

      I wasn't even there.

 Do you want to talk about it?

      I just want answers.

   The police are telling us
     two different things.

   It doesn't make any sense.

          You know...

      I've been here for a
      couple of years now.

     And I've seen alot of
   people dealing with loss.

             But...

    nothing quite like this.

 Whenever there's a tragedy...

      It's always so hard
       on the survivors.

        And I don't just
       mean the families.

       I mean the people
      who were involved...

      who could've just as
      easily not made it.

   Not only do you have this
     pain and loss, but...

      but you can get a...

   guilt that comes with it.

  Sometimes it's hard to find.

  It's hard to be a survivor.

    It starts to feel easier
       just to give up...

    but you can't, you know?

Mary: You have to keep fighting.

     (Heartbeat on monitor)
          There it is.

   Sounds really strong too.

  I'll give you two a minute.

 I don't mean to be intrusive.

   No, my dad would have told
     me to suck it up too.

    That's not exactly what
         I was saying.

            I know.

         (Phone rings)

    I have to deal with the
 families that come in here...

      all the time and...

    it's never easy for the
       one that made it.

   (Phone ringing continues)

     If you need anyone to
     talk to or anything...

        I work until 10.

            Thanks.

   (Phone ringing continues)

        Hi, front desk.

     Down in the archives?

      Ok, sure, what file?

     Ok, yeah it'll just be
      a couple of minutes.

   On TV: Hey boys and girls,
      it's Captain Morgan.

  And you know what, it's that
      time of year for...

        Captain Morgan's
        Haunted Hayride.

 We got werewolves, we got ...

    zombies, we got headless
     people running all...

         we got it all!

So, come on down Friday the 30th
    and Saturday the 31st...

 that's Halloween night and if
     you're brave enough...

     to ride in our ride of
     terror and survive...

  well then you might just get
       to meet Pitchfork.

      Pitchfork, himself!

 Make sure you bring the kids!

      (Laughs maniacally)

            No! No!

       (Screams in agony)

          Feel better?

          Not really.

    I mean, about the baby,
       little Steven, Jr.

         You mean Lily.

             Lily?!

   Yeah, you don't like Lily?

        I really don't.

       This is gonna be a
       problem isn't it?

   I can almost guarantee it.

 We're not naming our son Lily.

          (Both laugh)

     Sorry Mr. Summers, the
    doctor will see you now.

           Love you.
        - Love you too.

    (Metal door swings open)

      (Screams) Oh my god!
        - Sorry, sorry.
   Oh, my god! You scared me.

     Yeah...I thought I was
      going the wrong way.

        Where ya headed?

         Waiting room.
  - No, that's the right way.
 Everything just looks kinda...

        messed up cause
      they're remodeling.

  Tax dollars at work I guess.
   - Alright, thanks...sorry.

        (Muffled shriek)

           (Screams)

              Hey!

             Corey!

       Hey, put her down!

            Rayborn!

Security Guard: Drop the knife!

        Drop the knife!

       Drop the knife you
     motherfucker drop it!

           (Gunshots)

   Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
   to stay back, let's go...

  come on, nothing to see down
    here, let's go, come on.

Sir get back in the waiting room
 until we've secured the area.

        Corey. That's my
        fucking brother!

         Are you okay?

        I tried Steven.
            - Tried?

        Where's Amanda?

      Alright, I know you
        boys are tired.

 It's been a long fucking day.
      Some of you been on
       24 hours already.

 ER Doctor: Ok, what do we got?

45 year old male, unresponsive,
    motor vehicle accident.

    But, I don't wanna hear
    about that right now...

 and I don't want to hear about
   the Boogeyman, monsters...

    or spook stories either.

  Local legends, no matter how
 many times we've heard them...

    are still just legends.

What I need you concentrating on
 is finding that little girl...

    and bringing that son of
      bitch to his knees.

     Now she's got a family
     that's missing her...

        people that are
      worried about her...

   now I know I don't need to
tell you, this guy's already...

    taken the lives of some
        of our brothers.

    So you keep that in mind
     when you run into him.

   I remember when you first
    came to live with us...

     dad told me it was my
   job to take care of you...

      cause I was bigger.

I remember this stormy night...

     ...after the ride and
     you couldn't sleep...

  so we sat on the porch with
dad, watched him finish a sixer

 and just listened to the rain.

      You asked dad if he
   ever got scared, remember?

   You remember what he said?

 I wanna tell y'all something.
  Every man on this planet is
gonna have to face his demons...

       and his monsters.

 Now demons are tough, because
 they come from inside of you.

         Now monsters,
    completely different...

       the only monsters
      you have to fear...

       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

      I remember thinking
    it was my job to protect
     you from the monsters.

   I never expected anything.

You may not be my little brother
  but you might as well be...

        and it's my job
       to protect you...

         and I'm sorry.

           (Screams)

Nurse: I think he's gonna be ok.
            - Yeah.

       Did they find that
       missing girl yet?
            - Nope.

      I sure hope they do.
        Bless her heart.

     Hey, hey, no no let...
    - What did you do to me?

Just save your life, that's all.
  - Then why does my ass hurt?

      Hey, did we get him?
  - No, he got a little girl.

        Ah, we gotta...

       You just rest man
      let them handle it.

      Don't underestimate
        this guy again.

   There's a reason that some
    stories become legends.

We will get him, you just rest.

 I'd feel better about this if
    you were in play on it.

   Yeah, I'm working on that.

     Nurse: Officer Loomis?

              Yes.

   Somebody's here to see you

            Thanks.

        What'd you get?

    Everything I could find.

            Perfect.

      It's only for Wincer
        that I do this.

  If you get caught with this
  I'll tell them you stole it.

Hey, black man from out of town,
    I'm sure they'll buy it.

      I'm sure they will.

What are you looking for anyway?

   I mean no offense, but...

     the convict, that was
      your jurisdiction...

   this is a whole new thing.

      Just trying to help.

    You need to be careful.

   Listen, it's my fault that
       Wincer got hurt...

       so I'm gonna help
         any way I can.

 And I've heard enough word of
mouth stories about this guy...

    I do not care about the
   campfire version anymore.

        In this case...

  I think it's the same thing.

  Our investigation indicates
    that Ms. Rayborn left...

     of her own free will.
  Apparently, with a young man
 she had been seeing secretly.

       Frankly, given her
 home environment, I'm glad she
       finally got away.

           Thank you.

   (On radio) This is Dayton.

  I think we found her sir...

           the girl.

  Dayton: I want every officer
hat's not watching that house...

      walking these woods,
          high alert.

  This is ground zero, we fan
   out from this location...

  and we go in every direction
   until we find the fucker.
         Now let's go!

    Let's move! Let's move!
          Let's move!

            Mooney.

  This is Dayton, we're gonna
       set up a new grid.

        Figure that out.

       Loomis: Endurance.

     I asked my father what
     a lifetime as a police
      officer taught him.

That's what he said, endurance.

      He said that in the
    aftermath of tragedy...

     endurance is our only
  contribution to one another.

     Because, we can endure
     what they can't right?

  We're not directly involved.

      But he never had to
    face anything like this.

       He's right though,
   endurance is all we have.

 Sometimes the families of the
   victims turn against us...

      'cause it makes them
          feel better.

     And if it does, great.

      We've done our job.

     Now, this Dayton, he's
     an arrogant asshole...

  but he's a motivated asshole
and he will hunt this guy down.

  I'm sure this is the resume
 builder he's been waiting for.

       Did you read this?

   Yeah, interesting read but
    nothing really to go on.

  Yeah, now you know why these
   stories are so popular...

   with the kids around here.

    No, I became a believer
         this morning.

     Sometimes you hear so
      much of this shit...

       you forget it all
   started with real people.

            Oh fuck.

        Where's the kid?

           What kid?

      Easy, I don't think
      that's a good idea.

    I've been sitting on my
        ass long enough.

         Mind if I sit?

  We don't feel like answering
    any questions right now.

  I don't have any questions.

  I don't know where to start.

       12 years ago I was
       working a wreck...

  near here on Christmas Eve.

There wasn't much we could do...

  just waiting around for the
  fire department to show up.

   The hardest part of my job
      is notifying family.

 Your uncle was suppose to meet
   your parents in Atlanta...

        but instead, he
       brought you here.

     They let me go out on
       the boat with him.

 We go back early so he brought
me here instead of meeting them.

    My parents were pissed.

      They hated it here.

   Son they didn't hate it...

    they were scared of it.

        Yeah, Detective
       Loomis for Dayton.

       What the hell's he
     doing on Brewer Road?

 Dammit, get him off there he's
not doing us any good up there.

        This is Dayton.

    Yeah, patch him through.

      Dayton, it's Loomis.

     Hey there city, how's
      our boy holding up?

 Yeah, I'm looking at it now...

   figure if he's a hermit he
   might show up back here...

        but trust me, we
     searched that house...

    I got forensics sniffing
   around he's not in there.

          No, listen.

      Dayton, listen there
         is more to it.

 Look, as soon as Wincer starts
 feeling better you boys are...

 welcome to take a little walk
down here and see for yourselves

        but until then I
     gotta get back to it.

    No, listen dammit you've
      gotta look under it!

    There's a cellar you...

             Hello?

             Fuck!

   Forensics: I'd say time of
 death was sometime yesterday.

Ground's still dry under it too.

         That's my mom.

   I've never seen a picture
   of her this young before.

  That picture is from an old
police report from our station.

    She was the center of a
   missing persons search...

  when she was about that age.

             No...

       Dad was from here,
      she lived up north.

 Your dad and your mom had run
away from her abusive father...

  a farmer who lived near here
    by the name of Rayborn.

  Your father probably didn't
    know anything about it.
    He was just a baby then.

    He and uncle Mike didn't
      grow up together...

 they didn't get together until
    Steven and I were born.

  But that's not the story my
      father use to tell.

   That's not what I believe.

Your parents probably wanted you
 as far away from that past...

          as possible.

         Do you know...

  Do you know for sure that my
    parent's accident was...

            I don't.

They know not to come back here.

They avoided this place like the
   fucking curse that it is.

  They only came back for me.

 (On radio) Officer: Hey boss.

     Dayton: Yeah go ahead.

  This ain't the chick that's
       missing over here.

What the fuck you talking about?

   CSI is saying this girl's
 been dead a day, maybe longer.

          Easy, easy.

      We'll get her back.

         I need a car.

        What's going on?

 Your boy Dayton's about to let
         that girl die.

  The house has a basement or
  cellar or something to it...

   it's obviously well hidden
 and he wouldn't listen to me.

   Ok, find Sgt. Adams, he's
      a friend of mine...

   he's got a real knack for
       disobeying orders.

      Get him to lead his
        team out there.

    I'll get Wincer settled
  in and I'll meet you there.

           What's up?

    Loomis thinks Rayborn's
   hiding under his house...

   in a cellar or something.

    So he's going out there.

              And?

    Dayton wouldn't listen.

    Schmidty, I want you to
       watch these two...

      Shit, I want you to
    watch out for this guy.
      You, you're with me.

 (On radio): Suspect is a white
male, blue jeans, white t-shirt

       last seen heading
     towards the basement.

       Ah, hell with it.

    Alright, we're searching
        the house again.

        We searched it.

    We're gonna do it again,
        inside and out.

  If we breach the house we're
  gonna give up our position.

 Alright, did you not hear me?
 I said we're taking the house.

        That's an order.

     You don't give orders.

I do today, now let's move out.

         You got a gun?

Beats the hell out of a machete.

          Clear left.

          Clear right.

       Bathroom's clear.

    What are we doing here?
     I gotta get something.

         Do me a favor.

        If I don't make
       it back tonight...

    come back here and burn
   this place to the ground.

(On radio): This is team leader
      giving the all clear
      on the house, over.

 Looks like the house is clear.

      Surprise, surprise.

      I gotta take a piss.

       (Loud bang on car)

          Shit, shit.

        What the fuck?!

       (Gurgling noises)

Alright, so that cop said theres
  a cellar in Rayborn's house.

I'm gonna go distract the cops,
      you go around back.

        Hey, be careful.

       (Screams in pain)

             Hands!

     Let me see your hands!

What the hell are you doing here

     Looking for the cops,
     I can't find anybody.

            Ah shit.

  Where the hell is everybody?

  We don't know, we got blood
  all over this cruiser here.

    There's another cruiser
       up on the hill...

       but nobody inside.

        Try your radio?

    I couldn't reach anyone.

    Gotta search the house.

     Hold on just a second.

              Hey.

      I want you to go get
     in that cruiser and...

   lay down in the back seat
 until I come get you, alright?

           Fuck that.

      I wasn't asking you.

            Alright?

           After you.

      Is that gun loaded?

           Shoot me.

 I can't lift my arm to do it.

   Use my gun, they'll check.

    Don't go in that house.

        Close your eyes.

       I fucked this up.
       I fucked this up.

         No you didn't.

          We got him.

         You did good.

   I thought I was just gonna
       have to bleed out.

           Door left.

         (Man screams)

       It's me, it's me.
           - Steven?

       Back up. Back up.
      - Okay, okay, okay.

       Oh my god, Steven.
        - Are you okay?

      I'm okay. I'm okay.

          Where is he?

  I don't know, I don't know,
         I don't know.

       Alright, let's go.

        No, no this way.
           This way.

        (Both coughing)

             What?

    Corey's still in there.

     No, no Steven please.

Listen to me, I know he got out.

  Ok, he's not still in there.

   He would come back for me.

        Please don't go.

    Please, I know he's not
     still in there, okay?

 The villagers always kill the
monster with fire and pitchforks

             What?

  I'll come back for you, just
  stay in the truck you'll be
             safe.

   Please stay here, please.

    I'll come back for you.

              OK.

         Corey: Steven!

    (Corey screams in pain)

   Morgan: The only monsters
      you have to fear...

       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

 I'm not afraid of you anymore.

           (Gunshot)

         My dad says...

     a monster lives here.

          Not anymore.

      How you holding up?

        I'll be alright.

       I'll endure. You?
             Yeah.

 My dad use to say that people
  look at their scars as proof
      that they were hurt.

      It's also proof that
      there's healing too.

           Smart dad.

         Yeah, he was.

           Mine too.

               Â¶

   You know, I'm really glad
   you didn't sell the place.

         Yeah, me too.

  I'm especially glad that you
  didn't have to burn it down.

   You still talk to Loomis.

Not as much as before but, yeah.

          Doing good.

          Had a baby.
           - No shit.

      Well, his wife did.

 So how's the business running?

 It's going, got two new boats.

     Look at you, commodore
        Corey over here.

     Yep, I'm big time now.

    Seriously though, uncle
     Morgan would be proud.

       Jealous, yeah, but
     definitely not proud.

     Wanna go let baby girl
      open some presents?
    - Yeah, I guess we can.

   You didn't really get her
     a can of mace did you?
     - Nah, not this time.

 Seriously, Amanda freaked out.

     Well, I mean not until
     I can get her a taser.

     I mean if she grows up
   half as pretty as her mom.

   Or worse, as pretty as me.

     That won't be so bad.
 - What? I'd be crazy hot as a
             girl.

  C'mon baby let's go inside.

      Uncle Corey's ready
       to open presents.

            Morgan.

             C'mon.

        You ready to go?
        - Why? Why? Why?
