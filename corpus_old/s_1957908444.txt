[kids groan]

Kathy, the coin!

Quick, Tim. Catch it!
[Tim] No.

I-I can't see it.


[sniffs and growls]

Why don't you watch where you're walking,
you great clumsy lump!

[sinister music plays]

Sorry, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
Didn't realize it was you.

[dog panting]
[Tim strains]

Good dog.

[dog panting]


Prudence, stop licking that poor boy.

You've no idea where he's been. [laughs]

[ghostly whisper] <i>Scrooge.</i>

[Scrooge whistles] Come now, Prudence.

[Prudence grumbles and barks]

Bye.

Uncle?

Uncle Ebenezer, is that you?


[cheerful music plays]

[growls quizzically]

[jaunty music plays]


Uncle, it is you! I knew it.

Merry Christmas.


Where's the finest lady in all of London?

Prudence, girl.

You grow more beautiful
with every passing year.

Is Uncle Scrooge
taking good care of you, is he?

You don't miss
that rotten old Jacob Marley too much?

Why, I was just on my way
to your office, Uncle.

What luck to run into you.

Well, Harry, they say
a man makes his own luck.

So I suppose I only have myself
to blame for this encounter.

[bell tolls]

Out of time, Jenkins.

[sad music plays]

Good girl. Oh, yes.

There it is.

Yeah, there's a good girl. Yes.

[carolers play "Good King Wenceslas"]

Care to make a donation?
To the festive fund for the poor?

Just enough to make Christmas merry.
Or perhaps a little bit more?

[both chuckle]

Do you have a permit to perform here?

We didn't know we needed one.
Did you know we needed one?

I didn't know we needed one.
We didn't know we needed one.

Well, now you know you need one.

So pack up your trumpets,
before I call the police...

[music fades]

...to throw you all in prison,
leaving me in peace.

Good day, ladies. [laughs]

[ghostly whisper] <i>Scrooge...</i>


Uncle! Uncle!

Oh, splendid.

Uh, here you go.
Oh!

Thank you very much, sir. Such generosity.

Such generosity. Thank you very much, sir.

Think nothing of it.

Why, who would be
uncharitable at Christmas?

[both scoff] Who indeed.

Uncle. Wait for us!

I swear I had your money in hand
yesterday, Mr. Scrooge.

It's just that my mother, she got sick,
you see, and I had to pay for a doctor.

Another fascinating story, Jenkins.
But here's a better one.

Once upon a time,

Tom Jenkins, that's you,

owed me, Ebenezer Scrooge, 25 pounds.

Jenkins paid the money in full,
and Scrooge lived happily ever after.

The end.

Oh, come on now, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
I don't have it right now,

but I'm sure I can scrape it together
in another three, four days.

Five. A week.

Come on, it is Christmas after all.
[toy trumpet plays]


Louder.

Faster!

He's rubbish.
[laughter]

Christmas? Really? If only I'd known.
This changes everything.

Very well, in the spirit of the season,

Mr. Tom Jenkins, you now have
until the end of Boxing Day to pay me.

Two extra days. How does that sound?

Two days is better than nothing,
I suppose.

Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.
Most charitable indeed.

Father Christmas has nothing on you.

Ho ho ho, yes, quite.

Now, let's see.

For the inconvenience you have caused me
and the extra two days,

shall we say another 25 pounds?

That would mean I owe...
Fifty pounds.

It's a good, round number,
wouldn't you agree?

Well, 30 is a round number too,
Mr. Scrooge.

You're right. But so is 60.

[toy trumpet plays]

When you put it that way,
50 does have a better ring to it.

<i>â™ª Two days, Jenkins, then I'll be back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To take my 50 pounds â™ª</i>

Do give my best to Mother Jenkins.

Oh, and Tom,

merry Christmas.

Fifty pounds. Two days.

Look out. [groans]


[ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
[Scrooge] Hmm?

Do you deliver?

[toy squeaks]
Mr. Jenkins?

[Prudence whines]

[intriguing music plays]

Bah, humbug.

Left a bit. Right a bit. Left a bit again.

Up. No, up.

Left.

Your other left.

There, perfect. You're an artist, Mickey.

An artist would get paid more than a penny

for every thousand posters
he sticks up, Beryl.

You there. Yes, you. Who are you?
What do you think you're doing?

Who, us?

Sir, we is nothing
but a bunch of poor, homeless urchins

trying to make our way in the world.

[giggling]
[Scrooge snarls]

Quick. Leg it!

[children laugh]

Merry Christmas! [laughs]

Blooming children.

[magical tinkling]

[door slams]
[yelps] Mr. Scrooge. Oh dear.

Welcome back, sir.
There's something I should tell you.

The cost of that ink
will be deducted from your pay.

What? The ink?
Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.

Get on with your work, Cratchit.

If it's not too much of an inconvenience.
But, sir...

I do not wish to be disturbed.
[Bob] Yes.

I've had more than my fill
of people for one...

[toy trumpet plays]
...day.

[laughs loudly]

We win!
How in the world did you...?

Prudence knows a shortcut, don't you?
[barks]

Very well, let's get this over with then,
shall we?

How does it go again?
Oh, yes, yes, the question.

"Uncle, won't you join me
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"

The answer,

"No, Harry, I will not."

"Christmas is a humbug.
I despise it and all it stands for."

The same answer to the same question
you ask me every year.

I have no time to be merry.

Just because my partner is dead doesn't
mean I have no business to attend to.

Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died
seven years ago this very night,

leaving me nothing but business.

Oh, yes, and you.

Oh, come now, Uncle.
Hela and I would just love to have you.

Hela? Who's Hela?

You know, Hela, my wife.

She was disappointed
you couldn't attend the wedding,

and simply can't wait to meet you.

So at least visit us this evening.

Some friends and I
are gathering to toast the season.

Good day, Harry.


Uncle, I'm all the family you have.
Why does it have to be this way?

I think Mother
would have been so disappointed

that you and I
spend every Christmas apart.

[weights clatter]

[ominous music plays]
[whimpers]

[Scrooge growls]

Harry, life is full of disappointments.

One such disappointment came
on the glorious Christmas Day

that you stumbled into this world.

The very same Christmas Day your mother,

my beloved sister, left it.

I will not be joining you
for Christmas dinner,

nor any other celebration
of this wretched season.

Now, please leave
before I say something you will regret.

[Scrooge breathes deeply]

[Prudence whimpers and growls]

[mysterious music plays]

[ghostly whisper] <i>Scrooge.</i>

My offer still stands.
You are always welcome, Uncle.

Goodbye!
Merry Christmas, Prudence.

Bob.
Merry Christmas, sir.

[door closes]


[clears throat] Excuse me, sir,
but it's almost 6:00. Six o'clock.

Could I trouble you for my wages, please?

Cratchit, Cratchit, Cratchit...

you do nothing but trouble me.

[chuckles] Yeah.
[Prudence whimpers]

Five, 10, 15 shillings.

[Bob] Thank you, sir.
Take away five.

But I'm owed 15.

Consider the other five
your payment to me.

For what, sir?
The ink, of course.

And the day off
you insist on taking tomorrow.

Well, sir, it is Christmas.


Yes, as everyone is so fond of telling me.

Sir, this isn't enough.
My family, you see, my children...

My... My boy needs medicine.

You have children?

Of course you do.

Cratchit, times are hard.
And my financial burdens are considerable.

Now should I add to them by paying
for theÂ upkeep of your entire family?

[ghostly whisper] <i>Scrooge...</i>
[Scrooge] Does that sound fair to you?

No, sir.

No, sir, indeed.
Now, let's get you on your way, shall we?

Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.
Yes, yes. Ding-dong, merrily.

I expect you
at half past seven on Boxing Day.

[Prudence growls quietly]

What? What have I done now?



Why, if it isn't the amazing
and wonderful Cratchit children!



[gasps] Tim!
Father, help!

It's all right, my little man.
Just breathe, slowly.


He's getting worse.


That's it. There you go.

Right, you two.
That's it, no more busking tonight.

It's freezing out here,
and you need your rest, young man.

Aw.

But we've only made ten pence ha'penny.
Ten pence ha'penny? A bumper windfall!

If we add that to the ten shillings
I happen to have in my pocket

and throw in a bit ofÂ Cratchit magic,

I reckon we can have as fine a Christmas
as the Lord Mayor himself.

[both] Yay!
[Bob] Just wait and see.

[carolers play "O Come All Ye Faithful"]

[Prudence whimpers]


[Prudence growls]

Oh, don't be so dramatic.

I'll pick up a juicy bone for you
on the way home. How does that sound?

[whines happily]

The butcher owes me seven pounds six...
[Prudence scoffs]

...so I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.

[ghostly whisper] <i>Scrooge...</i>

No?

No pleasing some people.

[carolers play "O Come All Ye Faithful"]

You there. What do you think
you're doing? [laughs]

[children laugh]

[Scrooge snarls]

Oh, bravo!

There you go.

Merry Christmas.

Disgusting.

Prudence. Oh, how well you look. [laughs]

I knew leaving you
in the care of Uncle Scrooge

was the right thing to do, hmm? Didn't I?

Hmm? Yes, I did. I did. [chuckles]

I do apologize
for the dramatic entrance, old boy.

Those in charge
insist on a touch of pageantry.

Goes with the territory, you see.

But I'm sure you and I can discuss
the rest like reasonable men.

Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.

I'm dreaming.

for eating cheese so close to bedtime.

Well,

very well.

[Scrooge chuckles]

[dramatic music plays]

[Scrooge yells]




This is no dream.

Look upon the chain that binds me.

In life, I forged it,
link by link, yard by yard.

It grew to match my greed.

In death, I will never be rid of it.

Nor will you yours.


Yes, yours.

[Scrooge yells and whimpers]

[dramatic music plays]

[Scrooge panting in fear]


Trapped in our own selfish worlds.

We never reached out
to our fellow men in life,

so are condemned to do so in death.

We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.

Watched your chain grow,
link by link, yard by yard.

But you may yet escape our fate.

I have pulled a few chains

and arranged for three visitors
to call on you before morning.

The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.

The second, at 2:00.

And the third, at...

Well, 3:00.

[Prudence whimpers]

[dramatic music continues]

Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.

And heed my warning

before it's too late.

[Scrooge whimpers]

Jacob Marley

concerned for someone else's well-being?

Well, it must have been a dream.

[Scrooge chuckles]


Huh?

Humbug.

It's that nephew of mine. Interfering.
Bringing my blood to the boil.

Has me jumping at shadows.

Oh, hello.

It's Scrooge, isn't it?

Yes, that's the one, Scrooge.

Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?

Uh, well...

Never mind that.

Who, or what, are you?

And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.

Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?

I can be anyone you have ever known.
I can even be you.


Bah, humbugs.

Christmas is an outrage.

Grr, give me your money.

Interest rates, and so on.
Hmm.

You were not told of my coming?

No? No matter.

You have nothing to fear from me.
After all, your welfare is my business.

Miss, to be disturbed at this hour
is hardly conducive to my welfare.

Your redemption, then.

You see, an old friend of yours

asked me to illuminate
a thing or two for you. I...

Illuminate what, exactly?

I was getting to that.
You are an impatient one. [clears throat]

I will show you the past.

Christmas past.

Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!

There. Much better.

I've gone mad.

Mad, you say?

Jacob Marley floating in my sitting room.

Faces etched in frost.
Whispers in the wind.

A blizzard indoors.

Now you, a talking waxwork
with a wick for brains.

My dreams are never this... exciting.

And none of this can be real.
So, yes, I must be awake,

but quite insane.

Well, I may have wick for brains,
but I do think I'm real.

Here.

[growls]
[Past] Oh, hush now.

There, did that feel real?

I-I suppose it did.

It hurt too.

Especially yours.

But it can also heal,
if you learn from it.

Now, come with me.
Absolutely not.

I refuse to go anywhere...



Yeah!

Sorry, it does take its toll
going this far back.

Did I not warn you?
No, you certainly...

Wait, what do you mean by "back"?

Huh?

[man sings backwards]

What...?
We're not quite there yet.

Almost.

Here we are.

[magical music plays]

The past. [chuckles]

Spooky! [chuckles]

I know this place.

It was demolished years ago.
I saw to that.

<i>â™ª ...looked out on the Feast of Stephen â™ª</i>

You there. What day is it?

I say... [groans]

Ah! Oh! Oh!

You can't interfere with anything here.

And nobody can hear you.
Or see you, for that matter.

[eerie music plays]

[man] Don't fill it right to the top.
Look!

Young Ebenezer Scrooge,
hard at work on Christmas Eve.

Not very festive, is it?

I...

I-I had no choice.

You see, without the modest income
I provided, my mother and sister,

th-they would have starved.

Did your father not have any money?
My father?

He was not a poor man,

but the fool spent his way
into debtors' prison.


Oh, I see.

Debtors' prison. Terrible, terrible thing,
a debtors' prison.

What is a debtors' prison again?
A debtors' prison is, uh...

None of your business.

[jaunty music plays]

Now, look here...

<i>â™ª Is pretty well sure to come true

<i>â™ª So the wish that I wish you tonight

<i>â™ª May you spend Christmas mornings â™ª</i>

Jen. Come on, breathe.
[Jen coughs]

Slowly.

In and out.

That's it.

What are you doing here alone?

Does Mother know you're out?
I wanted to give you this.

I made it all by myself.

Merry Christmas, Ebenezer.
Oh, Jen. It's Father Christmas.

He's really magnificent.
[Jen chuckles]

Maybe you could help me
make one for you in return.

Yes, please! [Jen laughs]

Shall we sing
that pretty song of yours as we walk?

On Christmas Day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is pretty well sure to come true
They say â™ª</i>

Oh, such a sweet child.
Will she be all right?

She will be. For a while, at least,
the sickness will not take her.

My father paid his debts, eventually.

We found the right doctor
and she was saved. But...


She remained a delicate soul,
whom a breath might have withered.

Jen died in childbirth.
My idiot nephew in exchange for my sister.

A sorry transaction in any currency.
And all on Christmas Day.

Christmas.

Oof. Humbug.

Oh, come now.

Is there not one Christmas
you remember fondly?

One buried, perhaps,
in a hole as deep as old Marley's grave?

Hmm?

Hmm?
Hmm.

Merry Christmas, sir.
[Scrooge groans]

Hello, Uncle.


[exclaims]
[Scrooge yelps]

Aha!

I do believe I've found one.

Mr. Fezziwig.

"Fizzywig?" Why, that's almost
as silly as "Scrooge."

Off we go.

A little jump forward this time.
Wait...

[magical music plays]

And not before time.

Very well. You have a week and no more.

Or we shall both
have to find new employment.

Good day.
Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.

God bless ya.
And a merry Christmas when it comes.


It is.

My word, you were
a handsome chap, Scrooge.

What went wrong?


Is that you, lad?

Mr. Fezziwig?
[Fezziwig] It is you!

Wonderful to see you, my boy.


Fezziwig. Yes, I used to work
in his warehouse before Marley took me on.

Why didn't you keep working for him?

Marley offered a position
with more security.

People will always need money.

If I'd stayed, I would only have been
Fezziwig's lowly apprentice.

I had to better myself
before even thinking of proposing to her.

Proposing?

Oh, I do like a wedding.
Who's her? Where's her?


Isabel.

Yes, Father?

[romantic music plays]

Isabel.
Isabel.


Ebenezer! How lovely to see you.

My, you look splendid in your suit.

Although, do you mind?
I... I...

That is...
There.

You see...
Perfect.

Thank you.

Oh, Isabel, how I love thee.

With thy big slobbery face
and stinking dog breath.

Oh! Oh.

Uh, Ebenezer, do you have
any plans for tomorrow?

Tomorrow, sir?
You know, Christmas Day, my boy!

No, sir. My sister
is with her husband in Kent.

They're expecting a child any day now.

She invited me to visit,
but I had to decline.


You'll join us
for Christmas lunch tomorrow.

I'm not sure I can.

Too much still to be done, and Mr. Marley
doesn't even take the day himself.

Say you'll come, Ebenezer.
It'll be such fun.


I, uh...

I'll talk to Mr. Marley.

Did you go?
Well, it would have been rude not to.

I felt obliged.

I see.

See you there.

But you didn't enjoy it?

No. Not one bit.

Hmm.

[joyful fiddle music plays]

Home. Finally.

Oh, you do catch on quickly, don't you?

[Prudence barks]

Ebenezer? Are you there?
I brought some lunch.

I see so little of you these days,
so I thought...


Ah, lovely Isabel.

But you said you didn't marry her?
We are...

Were merely engaged. For quite some time.

I see. I thought you would have
gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?

Of course not!

His charity would have led to the same
ruination that befell my family.

"His charity would have led
to the same ruination

that befell my blah, blah, blah."


I needed more security
than he could offer. We needed it.

I saw them by the baker's
only a few minutes ago. Good day.

Lead on. <i>Allons-y.</i>

[baby cries]

Please, Mr. Marley, sir.
This is my livelihood. My home.

My family will starve. Just one more week.

One more day,
and I'll have your money, I swear.

You've had three weeks already.
I am sorry.

No. No apologies, Ebenezer.

Times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.

Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

Does that sound fair to you?

Sir, it's Christmas Eve.
Come on.

Please, show some mercy.

[woman] Where are you taking him?
[man] Clear off. Go on. On your way!

are considerable.</i>

<i>Now should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?</i>

<i>Does that sound fair to you, Cratchit?</i>

I... I don't recall this at all.

I'm not surprised.
As horrible as this situation is,

I'm sure it was of great financial benefit
to you and Marley.

Apart from the delightful Miss Fizzlejig,

you only seem to remember encounters
where you lose money.

You dwell on the bad things in life,
and then learn nothing from them.

Does Cratchit know?

Why would he choose to work for me?
After what I...

If his father had only paid his debts...

[Jacob laughs]

It's not my fault.


[Isabel sniffs]

She saw all of this.

[magical tinkling]

[knocking at door]


Can I talk to you?

Alone.


I have far too much work.

Later, later.

[Jacob chuckles]

I'll, uh, leave you two lovebirds to it.

[growls]
[Jacob] Come, Boris.

[melancholy music plays]

No.

[melancholy music continues]

[music fades]


Some assistance, please.

Yes, Jacob, coming.

Later, Isabel.

No!

There is no "later!"

Goodbye, Ebenezer.

[sad music plays]

A wee glimpse into Isabel's future.

Oh, she looks so happy.

And her husband's gorgeous.

That... That could have been you, I suppose.
Oh, too bad, Scrooge. Too bad.

Why show me all of this now?
What's done is done. I can't go back.

When we were financially secure,
I would have married her...

eventually.

Wouldn't I?

I don't know.

[magical tinkling]
[gasps]

[Scrooge yells]
Bye!

Take me back.

Take me back!

I'm afraid I can't.

There is no going back,
nor changing what has been.

You said so yourself.

You can't change the past,
but you can learn from it.

For your own sake, I hope you do, Scrooge.

Ooh.
[Scrooge] No, no, no, no!

Whoo! It really is time to go.

Farewell, Scrooge.

Farewell. [laughs]

No, please! Don't leave me here!

I must.

Ooh. I have shown you what was.

Now another will show you what is.

Oh. Ooh.

Remember what you have seen, Scrooge.

Remember. Learn.

Change while you still can!

Hello?

Huh?

[dramatic music plays]

[cheerlings squeaking]


Who dares disturb my slumber?

[dramatic music continues]

State thy name and business, puny mortal.

[cheerlings squeak]


I can't... I can't keep it up.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

It was her. She dared me.
[cheerling laughs]

Oh, we do like to have fun here.

Don't worry.

I know who you are.

Come on, bring it in,
Ebenezer Scrooge. Bring it in!

[Scrooge groans]
Welcome, my friend. Welcome.

Welcome where?

Where am I?

When am I?

Oh, you are in the here and now.
In the present!

Isn't it just fabulous?

[cheerlings squeak]

It's fine, I suppose.

From here, I can go anywhere I please.

Just so long as it's happening right now.

And I do so love to visit

your teeny-tiny,Â tootsy-wootsy,
little planet at this time of year.

So much love, generosity, and good cheer!

Which, conversely, brings me to you.

Me?
Yes, you.

Squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
clutching, covetous you!

[magical tinkling]

Secret and solitary as an oyster,
you edge along the crowded paths of life

keeping everyone at a distance.

[magical tinkling]

Why, you stopped truly living your life
so long ago, you might as well be dead.

Do not presume
to tell me how to live my life.

I lead a good life.

I'm a good man. [grunts]


Uh, uh, uh.


<i>â™ª The sins of man are huge</i> â™ª

[cheerling swoons and squeals]

Do you see the light?

Can you feel it, Scrooge?

Are you ready to live your life,
now, in the present,

unencumbered by the weight of the past?

[exciting music plays]

I'm ready.

I'm ready to go home. Thank you very much.

[music fades]

Oh, really?

But the fireworks.
We did a whole song and everything.

Well, I'm not giving up on you yet,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

Come on. Let's hit the town.

Hit the town?
I'll hit something else in a minute.

Dragged from pillar to post
in the middle of the night. Huh.


[cheerlings squeak]

[Prudence barks]
[cheerlings squeak]

My friends, please.
I-I would like to propose a toast.

My friends, please. Oh...

Oh, thank you.

He really is a buffoon, that boy.

There's no need to whisper.

No one can hear or see you.

[Scrooge gasps]
Lucky them. [laughs]

Please raise your glass
and drink to the good health and long life

of my celebrated uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge.

[crowd mutter]
[woman] Boo.

I know. I know.

But I like old Scrooge.

No, no, no. No. Come now. I do. I do.
[woman] Why?

Why?

I never met my mother,
but my father spoke of her often.

Of her kindness. Her generosity.

It's hard to believe
that the woman he described

was that old stick-in-the-mud's
little sister. <i>[chuckles]</i>

But his sister she was.

And, by all accounts,
she and my uncle were inseparable.

She loved him without reservation,
and he, her.

So he can't be all bad.

I have to believe that somewhere
in that loathsome old carcass of his,

the man my mother loved
is fighting to get out.

I should like to meet him one day.

Which brings me to my next toast
of the evening, to my beloved mother.

As I entered the world, you departed.

Here's to the Christmases we never shared,
and the sad, short one we did.

[sad music plays]

Harry, my dear, sweet Harry,

let's not dwell
on the sadness in our past,

on those who cannot be with us.

Or refuse to be.
[cheerling squeaks]

Instead, let us celebrate
those who are here.

Hear! Hear!

[cheerling squeals]

Everyone, let us honor the past
by toasting our present.

To each other. To Christmas.

To friendship.
[man 1] Hear! Hear!

[man 2] To friendship.
To friendship.


Bravo!

[mysterious music plays]

[Scrooge sighs]

[jaunty music plays]

Oh, for goodness' sake,
where are we going now?


the beautiful home
of Robert Cratchit Esquire.

He owes these sumptuous surroundings
to the generosity of his employer.

I never knew
Cratchit had quite so many children.

No? Did you ever ask him?

Mmm. Pure nectar. An elixir
fit for Father Christmas himself.

The stuffing's ready, Father.

[both] And the birdie is plucked.
Tremendous work, my dears.

Roast goose with sage and onion stuffing
Ã  la Cratchit.

A legendary gourmet dish.


There's one problem. I'm not sure whether
to stuff the goose with the stuffing,

or stuff the stuffing with the goose.

[Mrs. Cratchit sighs]

Come now, my love.

It is a lean Christmas,
there's no denying that.

But we have each other
and we have the children.

We can stillÂ make the most of it.

In fact, I do believe this will be
the best Cratchit Christmas ever.


[children cheering]

[clears throat]
[spoon taps]

Not another toast.

If you please,
a toast to those whose generosity

have made possible
tomorrow's sumptuous Christmas feast.

Master Timothy and Miss Katherine,

the Christmas-caroling Cratchits,
of course.

And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

Oh! Scrooge?

What are you trying to do,
spoil our Christmas?

But his money paid for the goose, my dear.

No, your money paid for the goose.

If you can even call that a goose.
But he paid me the money.

Because you earned it.

Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.

Mr. Scrooge assures me
that times are hard, my dear.

Times <i>are </i>hard. For us, not him.

Nonetheless, he is the founder
of our feast, and we should drink to him.

Hear! Hear!

The founder of our feast indeed.

I'd like to give him
something to feast on.

He'd have indigestion all January.

[children laugh]

to your father.

For the love and happiness he brings us.

And to our Tiny Tim,
for the health we wish him.

And, for the sake of your dear father,

I will even drink
to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.

Long life to him and to us all.

And a merry Christmas to us all.


God bless us.

God bless us, every one.


I think Bob Cratchit's rather fond of me.

So is his wife.
Couldn't you tell? [chuckles]

And now, to the triumphant
musical climax of this celebration.

Master Timothy, Miss Katherine,
would you be so kind?

No.
[children] Sing, sing!

Go on, love. Sing, sing!

It's embarrassing.

Sing!

I will if Kathy does.

[Kathy sighs]

[gentle music plays]

<i>â™ª On the beautiful day

Timmy.

Oh, just breathe. Slowly. That's it.

That's it.
[Tim coughs]

There we go.

Slowly.

[ominous music plays]

[cheerlings squeal]

[Prudence barks]

Bob's boy, Tim.

What will become of him?

The future is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

I can only show you what is.

What's to come if you do not change?

Well, that will soon be revealed
by... someone else.

[cheerlings squeal]

[Prudence barks]
[cheerling laughs]

[cheerling squeals]


Look, friend, there really is
no great secret to any of this.

You just have to do
the best you can with the time you have.

But you better get started soon.

Because before you know it,
all that time you think you have

will run out.

We are no longer in the present.

This is the future.

This is what is yet to come.

Are you still in there, giant?

The fellow in the green robes?
Liked life and so forth?

No.

You are something else entirely.

You don't speak?

Your colleagues were
rather fond of speaking.

More than I would have liked.

So you are the one that will show me
what awaits if I do not change my ways.

Yes?

[eerie rustling]

So I should change, should I?

Why? Tell me.

I live my life as well as I can.

I have my faults, but who does not, truly?

Are all others
I've been shown this night without blame?

Am I the only one
with the power to change my life?

To change the lives of others?

Well? Am I?

Tell me!

[fearling laughs]

Oh, very well.

Lead on.

Show me what bleak future
my wickedness has wrought.

And, yes, nobody can see
or hear me, I know.


[magical jingling]

[fearlings laugh]

[Tom Jenkins] Ladies and gentlemen,

good morning to you
on this joyous Christmas Day.

We are gathered here as a group,
united by a common bond.

Namely, our feelings of gratitude

to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

[crowd cheer]
I know that fellow.

Jenkins. Owes me 25... No, 50 pounds.

I must say he looks uncommonly happy
for a man so deep in debt.

In fact, most of this rabble
owes me money.

Shush. Shush.

While we are all deeply moved,

those of us who Mr. S was so kind
as to lend money to over the years

are particularly grateful
for what he has done for us today.

[crowd cheers]
What have I done?

Certainly not forgiven their debts.

As your predecessor said,

you are showing me
what will happen if I do not change.

I did not change, yet I am celebrated.

And rightly so.

These creatures have finally
come to their senses. That's it. Ha!

It would seem the ordeal
to which I have been subjected

has been a complete waste of my time.

And yours, my silent friend.

No matter. All's well that ends well,
as they say.


That's right, Prudence.
They're cheering for me.

Yes.

<i>â™ª For I'm a jolly good fellow</i> â™ª

Ladies and gentlemen.

<i>â™ª On behalf of all the people
Who have gathered here today</i> â™ª


<i>â™ª I would merely like to mention
If I may â™ª</i>

[children giggle]


<i>â™ª Is one of lasting gratitude</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª For what our friend
Has done for us today â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And therefore</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª I would simply like to say</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Thank you very much
Thank you very much â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I feel as if
A losing war's been won for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To add a sort of final victory touch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But since I've left my flag at home
I'll simply have to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thank you very, very, very much â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thank you very, very, very much â™ª</i>

[crowd cheer]

[jolly music continues]

<i>â™ª Thank you very much
Thank you very much â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It isn't every day
Good fortune comes your way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I never thought
The future would be fun for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if I had a bugle, I would blow it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To add a sort of
How's-your-father touch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But since I left me bugle at home
I'll simply have to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thank you very, very, very
Very, very, very, very, very, very much â™ª</i>

[all] <i>â™ª For he's a jolly good fellow â™ª
â™ª For who's a jolly good fellow? â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª And so say all of us â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª </i>[Tom] <i>And if I had a drum
I'd have to bang it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To add a sort of rumpty-tumpty touch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But since I left my drum at home
I'll simply have to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thank you very, very, very â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Much â™ª</i>
[all] <i>â™ª For he's a jolly good fellow â™ª</i>

Thank you very much!

[Scrooge hums]
[Prudence barks]

Ha, ha! Oh, yes, indeed.

This is far more agreeable
than what your predecessors had me endure.

So what's next, friend?

[fearling laughs]

[thunder crashes]


[Scrooge whimpers]

[lightning crackles]

[ominous music plays]

Tiny Tim.

No.
It's all right.

<i>Cratchit, times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.</i>

[Bob] <i>My boy needs medicine.</i>
[Cratchit Sr.] <i>It's Christmas Eve.</i>

you do nothing but trouble me.</i>

<i>Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?</i>

I must go now, my little man.

[sad music plays]

I promised your mother
I'd help with Christmas dinner, but...

I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
Same time, all right?


[Bob cries]
Come on now, Father.

Till tomorrow then.
Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams.

[sad music continues]

I...

I could have done more.

I could have done something.

Poor Tiny Tim.

Friend, you have shown me
a Christmas yet to come

that mixes great joy with greater sorrow.

Tell me, is this what will be,

or what may be?

If I were to change,

would all this still come to pass?

[man whistles "Thank You Very Much"]

[sad music continues]

[fearling cackles]


[Tom strains]

[Tom laughs]
Gentlemen, please.

Sorry, Father. But you reap what you sow.

Is that not what your Good Book says?

I wouldn't hang about for any mourners.
Nobody's sorry to see this one go.

Nobody who doesn't walk
on all fours anyway.

Merry Christmas.

And thank you very much. [laughs]

[Tom sighs happily] Come on.

Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

[eerie whispering]

[menacing music plays]

[Scrooge gasps]


[sinister music plays]

No.

[sinister music continues]

No.

[ghost Scrooge moans]

[sinister music continues]

Spare me.

Let me return.

I will not become this man

whose death is the cause
of such celebration.

[suspenseful music plays]

Why show me this if I am past all hope?

[suspenseful music continues]

Am I? Truly?

[thunder crashes]

If... If I am beyond salvation,
then so be it.

But, please, the boy need not die.

Not when I have it in my power
to help him.

I beg of you, spare me for this reason,
if nothing more.

[suspenseful music continues]

[bell tolls]

I swear to honor Christmas in my heart
and keep it there the whole year through.

I will learn from the past,
live only in the present,

and strive for a better future.

For all!


[Scrooge strains]

Tell me I may yetÂ strike the writing
from the boy's cross.

I may yet break this chain! [grunts]

Please.

Please, tell me!

[fearlings squeal]

No!

[suspenseful music continues]


[Scrooge yells]

[suspenseful music continues]

On Christmas Day... â™ª</i>


That I dream... â™ª</i>

Please, no! No! Please, no!

[Scrooge screams]

[suspenseful music stops]

[Scrooge thuds]


Spare me! Spare me!

Please. Please!



[Prudence panting]


Prudence!


Oh, it's Prudence.

[sighs happily]


Well, was I... Was I merely dreaming?

[Prudence sniffs and barks]

[Past laughs]

[Present laughs]


[indistinct chatter]

You there!
[man] Huh?

I-I say, what day is it, my fine fellow?

Um, Tuesday, I think.

Ha, no.

Is it Christmas Day?

Well, of course it is.

[Scrooge laughs]

<i>â™ª La, la, la! â™ª</i>


It's Christmas, Prudence! [laughs]

[Prudence barks]
It's Christmas, and I'm alive! [laughs]

Wait, what time is it?

I'm glad Isabel found
the happiness she deserved.

Perhaps...

Perhaps it's not too late
for me to find my own.


[cheerful exciting music plays]

[sighs contentedly]
I did. I swear. I said...

Hello there.
[girl] What?

[Scrooge laughs]

What is it?
We didn't do nothing, Mr. Scrooge.

No, not yet, you haven't. [laughs]

I have some errands for you to run.
I can make it worth your while.


Errands?

[tranquil music plays]

[Scrooge whistles]

Thank you, Prudence. There's a good girl.

[boy 1] Ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Scrooge chuckles]

Mind how you go.


Almost done.

Magnificent.
What wonderful children you all are.

And, well, sorry to ask again,

but you're sure
you managed to get everything on the list?

Yes, sir.

The butchers and the bakers
thought I was having a laugh.

But then I gave 'em the checks.
They'll be here soon.

Splendid. And you did deliver
the invitations? All of them?

Of course.

No guarantee they'll come, though.
It is very short notice.

a clever young lady, aren't you?

As promised,
a gold sovereign for each of you.

Boys, since it's Christmas,
I ain't even gonna take my cut.

That's the spirit.
And you'll all stay for dinner, won't you?

Won't you?

[all] Yay!
[barking]

Ha! And help yourself to a gift.


[boy 1] Come on.
[boy 2] I get the biggest one.

Ready, Prudence?


[jaunty music plays]

<i>â™ª I'll begin again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will build my life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will live to know â™ª</i>

[uplifting music plays]

There we go. Comfortable enough, Ethel?
Yes. Much obliged, Mr. Scrooge.

Good, good, good.
Oh, and please, call me Ebenezer.

What's all this about then?
Tom, your debt is canceled.

Merry Christmas, my friend.

Oh, and give my best
to your mother, won't you?

Thank you. Thank you very much.


Ladies, 1,000 pounds for your fund,
this and every Christmas to come.


It's the doll from my mother's picture.
Uncle, I can't accept this.

You must.

It's a gift from an old fool who regrets
all the Christmases we never shared.



[uplifting music continues]

"Business partners"?
Yes, Bob. If you'll have me, that is.

Let's build a brighter future
for theÂ Cratchits together.

What do you say?
[Bob] I say yes!

God bless you, Mr. Scrooge.
