(boat horn blows)

(cell phone rings)

I am just leaving Ice Cream Palace.

You'd better hurry up, 'cause I'm
getting ready to crack the first bottle.

What are you doing?

Well, I'm just hanging up these amazing
flyers that my best friend made me.

I should be getting
good at it by now.

I mean, this is
business number what?

I have no idea. I can't count
past 10 without my shoes off.

Why are you starting
without me?

I thought we were having
a fun girls' night.

I figured that we'd pop in

some "Sex and the City" DVDs
when you get home

and we can throw olives
at the screen

every time one of the girls gets
screwed over by some douchebag.

Okay, so I'm guessing
you're still not over Sean, huh?

It's my own fault, you know?
I should have never let you set me up

with one of your lowlife friends,
let alone one with a six-pack.

Okay, be nice. I just maxed out my credit
cards buying you Chunky Monkey.

(phone beeping)

I think this is my first client.
I'll see you at home.

Hello.

Yes, this is Wendy.

Yes, he's my father.

A heart attack.

Wow.

And you haven't seen him
or spoken to him in a long time, right?

Huh-uh, not since I was 12.

He cheated on your mom,
didn't he?

Yeah, she was never the same.

I mean, he always used to send

Christmas cards
and birthday cards

and my mom would just
send them back.

Well, at least he sent cards.

I mean, some dads
don't even do that.

Yeah, but sending cards...

not really a way to have
a relationship with your daughter.

Now I have all these papers
to sign.

I don't even know
why I'm crying.

Look, we'll make a girls' weekend
out of it.

I'll pack up all the junk food
we have in the house

and we'll get you nice and drunk
before you sign anything.

Sounds great.

Oh man, you're gonna kill me.

I left all the Chunky Monkey
in the street.

We'll get some more.

# Come on, come on #

# Hide and seek and find me #

# Come on, come on #

# Fast-forward, rewind me #

# Come on, come on #

# Before I'm gone gone gone #

# Go on, go on #

# Take a picture of me #

# Go on, go on... #

So I have an insensitive
question to ask.

Hmm?

Do you think you're gonna
get anything out of all this?

You know, I don't know.
From what I remember,

my dad was not so good
with money.

Sounds like the apple
didn't fall far from that tree.

Hey, I pay my rent on time.

Since when?

Okay, maybe I need to have

the occasional odd job to get me through
until I find something...

Wait, occasional?
Let's not rewrite history here, okay?

Since I've known you,
you've sold organic coffee,

painted landscapes,
told fortunes,

and my personal favorite...
juggled fire in the Castro district.

Hey, do you know how hard it was
to catch those batons?

You singed off
both of your eyebrows.

Look, my point is

you learned how to catch them

and then you moved on
to something else.

I'm barely in the second phase
of the grieving process

and you're already
barking at me.

I think we're close.

We just made a wrong turn
somewhere around that pizza stain,

which puts us

one fingernail away.

Okey-doke.

You are not still mad.

You called me
financially irresponsible.

Okay, fine.

I promise
under the penalty of perjury

to never give Wendy Rollins
monetary advice

unless it is expressly asked for.

Thank you.

Now go get us some trash mags
and I'll fill up your tank with gas.

Deal.


(beeps)
Oh, you stupid

devil-worshipping machine.

I'll give you one last chance.

(beeps)
Why?

You would not be beeping
if I had a hammer right now.

I swear to God, I would smash you
into a million pieces.

Ugh.
(beeps)

(chimes)
What did you just do?

Looked like you were having
some serious trouble.

I would have
figured something out.

Maybe try some panhandling
up at the interstate?

Hey, don't knock panhandlers.
They make more than minimum wage

and they don't pay taxes.

Well, sorry if I offended you.
I was just trying to help.

I see you're making friends.

Hi, I'm Jennifer.

Chris. Nice to meet you.

He just bought us
a tank of gas.

Oh, was your credit card
declined again?

I'm now officially mortified.

Well, at the risk of causing you
any more embarrassment,

I'd better go.
I didn't get your name.

You know, we're just
passing through.

And I don't really
give my name to strangers.

Okay, well, you two
have a good day.

You, too.
Bye.

Ow.
What is wrong with you?

That really hurt.
Never give your name to strangers?

Really?
What, you've never heard that before?

Um, when I was five.

He was nice and cute.

I don't care. I'm not gonna give my name
to some gas jockey.

Did you see his car?

That boy does not pump gas.

Seriously, you need to drop it.

No, not until you admit

you were stupid
for not getting his number.

Don't give me that look.
I could stand here all day.

Fine.

I was stupid.
Yeah, you were.

You're pushing it.
(giggles)

Wendy: Oh, my gosh.

Jennifer: Whoa. Why didn't you
tell me you were rich?

Wendy: I had no idea.

Jennifer: Well, just remember I'm your
best friend and I love you dearly.

Wendy: I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

I'm Roy Hutchinson.
Hi.

You must be Wendy.

Yes. This is Jennifer.

She's my entourage.
Charmed.

Let me first offer
my condolences.

So what do you think?

It's amazing.

This is not
how I remember it at all.

Your father was very clear, Wendy.

He's left you everything...

the chateau, the winery...
everything here that you can see.

I don't know what to say.

I mean, my father and I
hadn't spoken in years.

Well, he spoke about you
constantly.

Jerry especially loved the story
about Wendy

running around the vineyards,
eating grapes and then throwing them up.

Yeah.

Let's go inside, shall we?

In accordance with
your father's wishes,

he was cremated.

He asked that his ashes be scattered
in the vineyard.

(clears throat)
Before you sign anything,

I thought you should know
a little bit about the chateau.

The premium label
is the Chateau Meroux merlot.

It's a bit pricey,
but consistently wins gold medals.

That's cool.
Yeah.

Due to the recession, however,

sales are less than a quarter
of what they should be.

The chateau has been surviving
drawing on your father's

million-dollar line of credit.
A million-dollar line of credit?

Well, it's almost as good
as a black card.

I don't know anything
about wine.

Your father didn't know
anything about wine either

when he first started.

Your head winemaker Francois...

he is a pro.
He's the key to the merlot's success.

The only question is, do you want
to go in the wine business?

I don't even know how to balance
a checkbook.

How am I supposed to
turn a winery around?

If you'd prefer, we could
put the chateau on the market.

But given the state of the debts,
you'd barely break even.

Okay.

The keys.

And the company credit cards.

I know this is a lot to digest.

Take some time to think it over.

I need to know by Monday.

Did he say Monday?
Today is Friday.

Okay.

Could you...?

Wait, I'm... I'm all over it.

Who the hell is that?

I have no idea.

Jennifer: Hey. Hey.

Jennifer.
I'm not gonna throw hard.

(Wendy yelps)
What the...?

What did you do that for?

You, out of the pool.

What are you doing?
I'll handle this.

I've dealt with vagrant freeloaders
all my life. You've met my brothers.

Hi.
Hi.

I'm Wendy.
And the ball thrower is?

Jennifer. What are you doing
in my friend's pool?

Your pool?

Are you Jerry's daughter?
Yes, she is.

Oh, great meeting you.

I'm Romario.
Of course you are.

I'm the assistant winemaker.

Your father invited me
to use the pool.

Must be nice to have a job
that lets you slack off all day.

Okay, don't listen to her.

You're more than welcome to use the pool
whenever you want.

That's very kind of you.

And you'll find out
we work really hard around here.

(speaking Portuguese)

Really?
Yeah.

Jen spent some time in Brazil
during college.

Ha. I'm from Sao Paulo.

How lovely for you.

Well, I'll get back
to my very hard work.

And I'll always be
at your service.

Thank you.

I need wine,

lots and lots of wine.

Food first.

Let's restock that fridge.
Yeah.

And you are?

Nathan Landry.

Wendy Rollins.

Ah, Jerry's daughter.

Yeah.

My condolences.

I own the winery down the road.

We were friendly competitors.

I was looking for Roy.

I thought I might make an offer
to buy the place,

now that Jerry has
ventured forth.

She really hasn't decided
what to do with it yet.

Oh, well, naturally.

Settle in.

Check out the books.
Give me a call.

I think you'll find
my price fair,

given the state of the winery.

Well, that was tacky.

Wendy:
Yeah, he's pretty bad, right?

I've been around enough dicks in my life
to know one when I see one.

Okay, why don't you deal
with the food?

I'm gonna go check out
the competition.

Why do I get stuck
with the food?

Because of my dad's
credit card.

Right.

Oh, Skittles.

Hey there.

Run.

Why are we hiding?

Because I don't want to go to jail
and get one of those prison showers.

I don't think they send you to prison
for breaking a bottle of wine.

Wendy: Anything's possible.

Wendy: Hmm.

You're kind of odd.

Oh, I'm odd? You're the one
who's been stalking me.

Stalking you?
Yeah.

And to be honest,
I don't really appreciate it.

Most of the women I stalk
are grateful.

Well, I'm not like most women.

You're not gonna get an argument
from me on that.


Well, I never really got
to properly thank you for today,

so let me repay the favor.

I already have a tank of gas,
but thanks.

Not your gas, you moron.
Your groceries.

You want to buy
my bananas and...?

Wendy: Oh, condoms.

Are you teaching
a sex ed class later?

Look, I appreciate the offer,
but I don't think it's appropriate

for a woman I barely know
to pay for my prophylactics.

I have no idea what that means,
but I will take your word for it.

What about dinner then?
Weren't you just passing through?

I was, but I just inherited
a winery.

Really? Which one?

It's called the Chateau Meroux.
Have you ever heard of it?

Yeah, yeah,
I think I've heard of it.

Well, when you get hungry,

just give me a call.

I still don't know your name.

It's Wendy.

Was that the guy from the...?
Yep.

Were you actually
flirting with him?

I was. I broke a bottle of wine
and offered to buy him condoms.

Oh.

What's for dinner?

I don't know.

I'm offering you a lot of money,

Francois.

I don't make wine
that's served from a box.

I don't want you to.

But I'm about to buy
a premium winery

and I want a premium winemaker
to go with it.

What winery are you buying?

The Chateau Meroux, of course.

You're buying my winery?

It's not yours yet, my friend,

but it could be.

But what if it was?

Complete creative freedom.

The old vine Zin.

Oh, those grapes produce
three tons per acre.

I can replant with just about
anything else

and make 12.

And if you owned
an animal shelter,

you could bottle the piss.


The old vine Zinfandel.

And if you want to bottle piss,

your son is the man for the job.

You're hiring the Chateau Meroux's
winemaker?

If I have to.

Well, you might want to know
that I met his new boss this afternoon.

Wendy?
Yeah.

How nice.

Ah, you're getting closer.

(rock song playing)

Yum.
Mm-hmm.

Here comes your man candy.

I'm so not interested
in a stupid farm hand.

Okay, a) don't be a snob;

b) this isn't a farm;

and c) that's what
farm hands are for.

He has a six-pack.
I don't trust him.

You threw something at him.
That's how I know you like him.

Hello, ladies.

Is there anything I can do
to help you?

Yeah, don't touch me.
Thanks.

So, what, you just went over there?

With Jerry Rollins dead,
we've got a good shot

at buying the place.

Chris: Good grapes.
Better than good.

I'm tired of boxed wines.

I deserve better.
We deserve better.

Now you want the Meroux?

I want the status

that comes with it.

Chris: Will she sell?

Nathan: I expect so.

She may need a little
friendly nudge.

No.

You want to start toying
with your little blends again?

Talk to her.

Get her to sell.

You'll get your little hottie back

and better grapes
to work with besides.

What about Francois?

I didn't hear him
agree to the offer.

Did you?

Hey, girls,
the grill is hot and ready.

That is so sweet of you, Romario.

Isn't that sweet of him?

He's a prince.
Thank you, Fabio.

some grapes to pick?

As a token of our appreciation,

we would be honored
if you would stay for dinner.

"Honored" is overstating it
just a little.

Come on, why don't you show us
city girls how to heat up some meat?

Jen here will help you.

Oh, don't give me that look.
I could stand here all day.

(speaking Portuguese)

(cell phone rings)

Hello. This is Wendy.

Hey, it's Chris.

Oh, my stalker.
How's it going?

Well, I was getting
these sharp hunger pains

and I thought it might be a good time
to take you up on your offer.

Sure. We're actually having
a little barbecue.

We?

Yeah, Jen and Romario.

Why don't you come on by
and eat your face off?

You know where
the Meroux is, yeah?

I think I can find it.
I'll see you soon.

Okay.

Hey, boys,
I'm having a guy come over,

so I'm wondering if you could maybe
stop on by so it's not too awkward.

You want to help your boss out?

Free food.

How the hell are you supposed to know
when they're done?

Well, give me your hands.

Feel the skin here.

This is rare.
Mm-hmm.

Here... medium.
Mm-hmm.

And here is well done.

Seriously?
Yeah.

Hey, look at you,
grilling like a professional.

It's my business.

Man: Romario.

Excuse me, ladies.

Oh, yo, who the hell are they?

They're my workers.

It's hot out. They were thirsty.
So I invited them to join us.

We don't really have enough food
for all these people.

Just cut everything in half.

Oh, and Chris is coming.

Homeboy must really like you
if he's hightailing it over here.

What can I say?
I'm irresistible.

What are they whispering about?

Romario: I think they're all worried
about losing their jobs

now that you're here.

I would never do that.

Okay, 20 bucks to the guy
who could tell me the dirtiest joke.

Who's up first?

I'll take you up on that.

Oh, hey.
Hey.

Um, stalker, this is everyone.

Everyone, this is my stalker.

Hey, Stalker.
Hey.

Looks like you guys
are having a good time.

Well, some of the guys... the workers,
they were hungry.

So I decided to invite them
to our mini-feast.

That's really nice.

We never did anything like that.

We?

Oh, well, my family
used to be in the wine business.

Well, I'll have to
pick your brain later.

All right, let's get you
some of this food, huh?

Fantastic. What started as hunger pains
are now full-on body spasms.

Oh.
This is it?

Wendy:
Okay, you know what?

I think food's overrated.

Booze... totally making a comeback.

It's a nice place.

Yeah, I grew up here.

Some of my favorite
memories of my family

are in these vineyards.

When my parents split up,

my dad and I really just didn't have
the best relationship.

I know a little bit
about that kind of situation.

I have to let them know on Monday
if I'm keeping the place,

and I just... I don't know
the first thing about wine.

Do you know how to drink it?

Right, right.

Well, that's a start.
The rest you learn as you go.

Really?
Yeah.

Take a sip.

The grapes are crushed into juice,
which turns into sugars.

And that sugar converts into alcohol.
Every one of these vines out here

turns out about eight
bottles of wine.

It can't be that easy.

Well, it's not,
but it's a start.

Wendy: Well, for a stalker,
you're pretty well-informed.

(Chris laughs)

I try.

Wendy: Sorry about dinner.

Let me make it up to you.

Yeah, sounds good.

How's tomorrow?

Great.

The dishes are done.

You didn't have to do that.

I ate your food, drank your wine.

I was happy to get my hands
a little wet.

with lines like that

you should be writing
greeting cards.

Why don't you like me?

I don't know.
Maybe it's because you sound like

you just stepped out of
a bad romance novel.

And you don't like romance?

Sure, I like romance,
just not with men that wax their chests.

(speaking Portuguese)

Mm-hmm.

Oh, what the hell?

I just went to bed, like,
20 minutes ago.

Oh, did someone have
a little too much vino last night?

Yes.

Bite me.

Come on, I need to get down
to the winery

to see what's what if I'm going to
take this place on.

What does that have to do with me?

I need my trusty advisor to come with me
to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

You'll be fine.
I have complete faith in you.

You just lied
to your best friend.

Go away.
I'll meet you downstairs in 15.


I hate you.

Wendy: I hate me, too.

Wow.
This is no joke.

Hi, Fabio.
Oh, hey.

My friend has some questions for you.
Yeah?

I don't really know anything
about the winemaking process.

Okay, well, why don't you let me
show you around?

Great.
Okay.

These are the barrels.

That's the bottling room.
That's the lab.

Francois: Take your hands
off the knobs...

Oh, and that's our
head winemaker Francois.

Well, let's not bother the man
if he's busy.

No, no, no, it's no bother.
Francois loves yelling.

Take your big hose
and pick it up, because...

Francois.

I mean it. I'm done.

Francois, this is Wendy.

Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

You must be Jerry's daughter.
I am.

He was a very good man.
Doesn't sound like my father.

Really? How well
did you know your father?

Uh, anyway, I'm here to learn.

Anyway, I don't have
that much time

to give lessons to amateurs.

Well, if I'm gonna be
taking this place over,

I need to know how things work.

What you need to understand
is the importance

of letting a professional
be alone

when he practices his art.

Maybe you need to understand

the importance
of the meaning of the word "boss."

In these vats
is the finest merlot.

I've won gold medals
five consecutive years.

You mean the wines have won?

They're one and the same.

What's in here?
Glorified grape juice.

Is it ours?
Unfortunately your father

sometimes had to press
other growers' grapes.

In this case the client was
as good as the grapes

and he didn't pay.

(thud)
Do not move the pallet.

I'm gonna ask you one more time

not to move the pallet.

He likes to yell.

This moves again and you will wish
you were under it.

It's a lot to take in.

Yeah.

So if I decide to keep this place,

I want you to be involved.

Obviously I'm great with people,

but I don't know the first thing
about marketing.

You want me to quit my job

and move out here
to run your marketing department?

Yeah, why not?

Well, for one thing,
it's completely irresponsible.

For another thing,
I have a job and a life in San Fran.

And you said yourself, you can
barely even balance your checkbook.

Boo on you for throwing my financial
ineptitude in my face.

And it's just a question.
You could say no.

Okay.

No.

(both chuckle)

All right, look,
maybe I can help out

on the weekends
like a consultant, you know.

I'll drive up here.
I have to go back to San Fran tonight,

but I'd be happy to come up
and help when I can.

No. Offer rescinded.

The offer was, like,
12 seconds ago.

Hey, you've got to act fast
on this stuff, honey.

Oh, thank you, Wendy,
for your very sound business advice.

Anytime.

So can I buy you a glass of wine

while I wallow in my missed
opportunity?

I wish, but I am having dinner
with Chris.

Oh, okay.

Well, enjoy.

Don't do anything I wouldn't do.


Are you kidding me?

Seriously?

It's good for stress.

You know, you should try it.

Right, only I'm not really stressed.

You're maybe more like repressed?


When are you gonna give it up?

Oh, well, when I get what I want.

Right, well,
I'm leaving tonight, so...

No.

You shouldn't drive
while you're so tense.

It's definitely not safe.
Uh-huh.

Why not leave
when you're relaxed?

Wow.



(Jennifer moans)

Oh, come on.

Come on.

(thudding resumes)


Um... (chuckles)

You.

What, you've never seen
a girl in a dress before?

Wow.
Actually I found it in this dumpster.

Once I got all the mayonnaise
stains off, it's pretty hot, right?

You're not normal.

Yeah, not in the slightest.

So where are you taking me tonight?

Somewhere cheap and dirty

or expensive and downright filthy?

Is that a trick question?

Well, I just need to know
if I should bring my Mace in or not.

It's mint-scented.

Hopefully I won't have to
use it on you later.

You'd better be a good boy.
(laughs)

(quiet music playing)

Thank you.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Ooh, it's strong.

When wine has a lot of alcohol,
we say it's hot.

Well, it sure is hot, then.
I might be giving lap dances later.

You know, I knew I should have brought
more dollar bills.

Yeah, you really
messed that one up, huh?

So what do you do

when you're not lurking
around gas stations?

I'm in...
(clears throat)

Mergers and acquisitions.

We buy and sell companies, turn things
around and sell them for profit.

We're in the middle
of a big project right now.

It could be
a big promotion for me.

That's great.

Yeah, yeah.

Um, what do you say we order?

Ready whenever you are.

Mm-mmm.

You're really enjoying that.

This sauce is so good.

I could take a bath in it.

Don't get any ideas.
No, wouldn't dream of it.

Are you interested
in dessert tonight?

Normally I would say yes,
but I'm completely stuffed.

I'll just take the check.

Actually, it's already been
taken care of.

What? You might want to leave.
This could get ugly.

Listen...
No, don't you "listen" me.

I was supposed to be
taking you out to dinner.

Yes, I let you pick me up
and I shaved my legs

and got a bikini wax just in case,
but that does not negate the fact

that I was supposed to be
treating you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude, dude, dude,

you can't freak out
every time I yell at you.

Chris: Wendy, we can't do this
right now.

Wendy: We are definitely
not doing it later, I can tell you that.

What the hell are you doing
under the table?

There's a woman. And she's...
Your wife?

Your wife? I knew it.
I knew I couldn't trust you.

How does it feel, huh?
Wendy.

What?

Wendy, she's not my wife.

She's not?
No.

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you bleeding?

A broken rib maybe.

Anyway, we dated a while back.
If she sees me with another woman,

she's gonna flip out.

Where is she?
That doesn't matter.

We just need to leave here
without being seen together.

Okay.

Wait, is she wearing
a red dress?

Um, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure, that's her.

Just meet me outside.

Okay, I'm on it.

Oh.

Thank you.

Hello, ma'am.
Excuse me, did you get the vodka tonic?

The vodka tonic.
All right.

(gasps)
Oh, no, I am so sorry.

I'm sorry about that.

Which part?

The part where you hid under the table
like a little girl

or when you hijacked
my thank-you?

Both.

How can I make it up to you?

You can't.
You're dead to me.

Come on.

Seriously, be a man for a second.

Why don't you pretend
like you've got a penis?


Fine.

Give me a tour of your winery.

Right now? It's late.

Since when are you not up for
a little adventure?

This is quite the operation
you've got here.

Wendy: Yeah, it's not too shabby.

It's not doing so well, though.

Well, you're probably making
the wrong kind of wine.

What do you mean?

Well, I've had your wine.
It's good,

but it's expensive.
And that limits your options.

How many people want to buy
a $70 bottle of wine?

That's true.
I've normally only spent $10.

Yeah, plus your signature wine
is a merlot.

"Sideways" killed that market
years ago.

You should think about
branching out,

you know, come up
with some unique blends

that are less expensive.

So you're saying I could blend
our expensive wine

and put it together
with our cheaper wine?

Yeah.

I mean, if that's what you want.

So how would you market that?

The Oakvale competition's
coming up.

The winner gets a major
distribution contract.

Even the exposure itself
would bring up sales.

You know a lot about this stuff.

Yeah, a little bit.

It's too bad you're stuck
in mergers and acquisitions.

I'm kind of trapped
in my family business.

My father never understood
my passion for winemaking.

Well, I think you'd make
a great winemaker.

You know,

the more I learn,

the more I like this place.

Maybe I'll stay.

You know, it's late.

I'd better get going.

But in the interest of pretending
I have a penis,

I demand that you make me
dinner tomorrow night

and it be ready by 7:00.
Yes, sir.

And you'll be wearing
a French maid's uniform.

Okay, now you're pushing it.
Let me walk you out.

Really, Romario?

What's wrong with this picture?

Jennifer... she wore me out.

So I heard.

You did?

You see, big house
plus thin walls

equals lots of echoing.

I'm sorry.

I must tell you,

I really like her.

Is that so?

I'm surprised.

I think Jennifer will be as well.

Good night.
Good night.

Oh, you're here early.

I thought you were gonna call
when you were done with Wendy.

Well, it got kind of late.

It wasn't like that.
Uh-huh.

How did everything go?

Fine.

She's kind of odd,
but she opened up to me.

Uh-huh.

And?

She's starting to like the place.

Huh. Well, then...

We'll have to speed things up.

Argh!

Damn sciatica.

You're getting there.

Right here.
Okay. Great.

<i>- And alli.
There.</i>

So is this the one
for the credit line?

Yes, we'll get it transferred
over to you real soon.

Super.

(cell phone rings)

Roy Hutchinson.

Roy, Nathan Landry.

Listen, I don't want to tell you
your job,

but don't you have
a professional responsibility

to tell your client she can't handle
the winery on her own?

Well, she's right here, Nathan.

Maybe you should tell her yourself.

Hello.

Miss Rollins,

how nice to talk to you again.

I just thought I'd catch you

before you did something foolish.

My offer on the Chateau Meroux
still stands,

but I will need to know today.

Well, that is very kind of you,

but...

I'm gonna keep the Chateau.

A bold decision.

I hope you know
what you're getting into.

Do I know what
I'm getting into?

We have to change
the game plan.

How so?

When are you seeing her again?

She's cooking me dinner tonight.

Perfect.

Just keep her busy.

Wait, what are you
planning to do?

Exactly what I have to do.

(cell phone rings)

(cell phone rings)

Hey, stranger.

Hey, how's it all going?

Well, I actually need you
to get your butt back here

because things are really heating up
with this whole wine madness.

I have a job.

Well, I'm gonna pay you.

It doesn't count when you pay
people in Twinkies.

I'll be back as soon as I can.

Okay, well, just remember
that I seriously need you

and you're gonna be plagued with guilt
until you get back here and help me out.

Is there anything else I can do for you
while I entirely uproot my life?

Oh, yes, can you get my yellow dress
and that cashmere sweater?

And then also by the door
I have these amazing

heels that...

No Twinkies for you.

I'm sorry I'm late.

I got held up
in a business thing.

Typical.

Well, you're gonna have to
sing for your supper now.

Well, I'm not the best vocalist.

I sound more like a dying dog.

Oh, okay.
Well, bark then.

Excuse me?

Just bark like the dog you are.


I'm not barking for you.

Then you're not coming in.

Wait. Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.


That was pathetic.

(both chuckle)

You... you're gonna
get punished for that.

I'm so not afraid of you.
Oh, you should be.

(owl hooting)

(pop song playing)

(owl hooting)

(quiet song playing)
Mm.

That was surprisingly good.

Well, I guess we're even now.

Not if I do the dishes.

So if you're interested
in another home-cooked meal,

you're gonna have to clean
my whole house.

What does this give me?

A blueberry.

Wendy, there's been an accident.
Come, come quickly.

We've lost an entire tank.

That's half of our best wine.

Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

I checked the tanks yesterday
and they were fine.

All right, go get cleaned up.

I'm sorry.

Look, Wendy, I really am sorry.

Look, what do you say

we clean this place up, okay?

Okay.

(clears throat)

Is there a problem?

Yeah, let me show you.
Oh, okay.

But seriously, don't get me wet.

I see where this is going.
Don't get me wet.

No, I'm not.
I wouldn't do that.

Okay, good.
'Cause that's not...

Stop.
What?

Don't get me wet.
You walked into the spray.

No, don't get me wet.
Okay, give me that.

No, no. Look, just be careful
not to release the nozzle too quickly.

What, like that?

Oh, that's not funny.

What about like that?

Okay. Stop it.

# I want more #

# It's not easy #

# In your chain of love #

# Not easy #

# When you're all I think of #

# I want more. #

So what are you gonna do now?

I honestly have no idea.

I mean, I guess Francois is really
gonna have to produce for us.

You could always sell the place.

Oh, believe me, I thought about it,

but I've had enough defeat
for one lifetime.

You've got some serious
challenges here, Wendy.

I don't want to see
anything bad happen.

Nothing's gonna hurt me.

You're not gonna let
anything stop you.

No.

Good for you.

It's never boring
around you, is it?

Not if I can help it.

Good night.
Good night.

Jennifer: Hey.
Hey.

I told you I'd be back.

Oh. What happened

to the important job you just
couldn't pull yourself away from?

I quit.
Really?

Yeah.
Oh.

That crazy guilt trip thing you did
actually worked.

And, I mean, let's face it:
You need me something fierce.

Besides, what kind of friend
would I be

if I wasn't there for you
in your hour of need?

Okay, well,

in the interest
of full disclosure,

I should probably tell you
that our wine vats exploded tonight

and we lost about 50%
of our juice.

Come again?

(cell phone rings)

Nathan, why are you
calling me this late?

Francois, we need to talk.

I'm having a big problem right now.
It's not a good time.

I'm upping my offer:

Leave the Meroux

and I'll finance
your private label...

anything you like.

I want the old vine Zinfandel.

Whatever.

I need to know in 24 hours.

Half your stock?

Like as in 50%?

More like 60% or 70%.

You said half.

Well, that's, you know,
an expression

like "I've never really
done this before."

Wendy, this is a disaster.
How are you so calm right now?

Whoa, that's not a tequila shot.

Oh, my God.

I quit my job.
I don't even have medical insurance.

How am I gonna be able to afford food?
How are you not freaking out right now?

Because I already freaked out and you're
making me freak out all over again.

Jeez.
Okay.

Okay, okay.

All right, so what do we do?

Okay, tomorrow morning we're gonna
start a whole new blend, okay?

We're gonna take the rest of what's left
of the expensive wine

and mix it with
the less expensive juice.

Do you have enough
to launch a new brand?

We'd better.

Francois and Romario are just
gonna have to really step it up.

How is the farm hand doing?

Apparently he really likes you.

Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no.
It was only supposed to be physical.

Don't hurt his feelings, okay?

Yeah, I know.

I know. Hmm.

Okay, so tomorrow, 10:00 AM,
senior staff meeting.

I need you there.

Yes, boss.

I like the sound of that.

Hey.
Hey.

What took you so long?

What made you think
I was coming back at all, hmm?

Don't joke.

Every moment away from you
is like an eternity.

Maybe less talking for you.

Come here.


You know what?
I have a really busy day.

Sorry.

I'm sorry. Sorry.
Okay.

We need to...
(zips)

We need to turn this place around,
especially after last night's accident.

So we're gonna create
a less expensive blend.

Your father did not hire me
to make slop.

Of course not.
I'm not suggesting that you create slop,

but we need to enter
new markets.

I really don't care
about new markets.

And I don't really care
about your problems.

Well, you'd better start caring,
because as of today, I'm your new boss.

You are not my boss,

because I'm no longer
your winemaker.

Wendy: What just happened?

My dreams of owning a summer home
were just flushed down the toilet.

No. No.

We can do this.

We just need
to lock down the blend.

Right.

Jennifer, you're on marketing.

Romario, you go and do
whatever it is that you do.

And I've got one more favor
to call in.

Pull!


Shit.
(cell phone rings)

Pull!
Now's not really a good time.

Wendy: 10 seconds.
I just want to tell you

we're launching a new wine
just like you suggested.

Jennifer is back.
We're full speed ahead.

That's...
Nathan: Pull!

Congratulations.
(gunshot)

Wendy: Yeah, the only teeny problem
is Francois just quit.

And I don't know anything
about blends.

Pull!

(gunshot)
Damn.

Maybe I can help.
Great.

Do you think you can come by
this afternoon?

I'll be there.

How's everything at Meroux?

You tampered with the vats,
didn't you?

Pull!


Nathan: Damn.
I don't know what you mean,

but if I did,

it would be because
I have our best interests in mind.

Pull!

(gunshot)
She's launching a new wine.

Say what?

She's launching a new wine.


How's she gonna do that
without a winemaker?

This is business.

And in business
I leave nothing to chance.

I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

It's wrong and you know it.

You've done
more than enough already.

Do that girl a favor.

Don't see her again.

When I own the Meroux,

I'll drop Francois

and you'll be
the head winemaker,

just as I promised.

(cocks gun) Pull!


Chris: Ooh, almost.

God damn it.

How am I supposed to know
which one?

We don't know exactly.

It's trial and error and a little prayer
thrown in for a good measure.

I don't have time
for trial and error.

Okay, what do you say
we change things up a little?

First, stop thinking.

It's not about the grape.
It's not about the process.

It's about what you like.
Okay.

Smell.

Now taste.

(clears throat)
It's a little dry

on the sides of my tongue.

Typical cabernet.
Ugh.

Now this.

It's fruity.

Is it fruity?

That's your merlot,

Chateau Meroux, 2006.

<i>- Oui, oui.
(both chuckle)</i>

Okay, one more.

Mm, I like this.

It's... it's soft

yet kind of spicy.

Is this mine?

It's a Syrah, not yours.

I wish it was.

(phone rings)

Adam, it's Landry here.

I've done better.

But compared to my neighbors,

I'm doing well.

What's that?

You didn't hear what happened
over at the Meroux?

Oh, they had a little accident.

I like this one.

Compare with the next one.
Okay.

This one is a little more Syrah.
Yes. Now keep going.

Now follow your instincts
until you find the one you like.

Psst.

It's her birthday next week.

Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

They're usually a disaster.

Text me some gift ideas.
I'll see what I can do about dinner.

Mm, you guys are the worst
whisperers in the world.

I like this one.

It's pretty good.

Let someone with a more
sophisticated palate be the judge.



(sucks in air)

(all laugh)

So that's it?
Almost.

Almost?
A little secret...

we strain it through egg whites
just to smooth it out.

Sounds like a really
disgusting omelet.

Trust me,
it's the finishing touch.

How's the design coming?

Why don't we just call it
Chateau Meroux Meritage?

Huh-uh, we gotta rebrand.

Apparently people see
the Chateau wine

as this old-school
grandma wine.

We want young, hip, trendy.
I get it. I just don't have it yet.

(phone beeps)
Well, a girl can dream.


How's Romario?
He's been texting me all day.

I mean, enough already.

Dirty texts?
No, dirty texts I want.

I get really stupid,
sappy love sonnets.

(phone beeps)

Just do me already.


What about a text abbreviation?

For "do me"?

No, no, no, for your wine... YN.

Wine... YN.

Oh, that's good.

That's actually really good.

YN... that's our new brand name.

(phone beeps)
Love it.


Romario, Romario.

Uh, what is this?

Shakespeare.

I read books.

Listen, what we did...

it was just physical.

But...
Just physical. No, no, no.

I can't do this.

But...
I can't.

What?

Wendy, this should just
take a second.

I need you to sign
this amendment

to the line of credit transfer
I filed.

Amendment?

Yeah, the bank found out
about the wine spill.

Oh.
They want to do an asset check.

Okay, this isn't gonna
mess anything up though, right?

No, it shouldn't.

Okay.

It should all be settled
in a couple of days.

You frighten me sometimes.

I get that a lot.

# Living the dream... #

# Living the dream. #

(cell phone rings)

Hey.

Wendy: Are you ready
for some madness tonight?

We're just going to Shorty's,
not robbing a bank.

You never know
where the night may lead.

Well, that's true.
I'll see you in a bit.

Hey.
Hey.

Did you need something?

Why don't we grab dinner later

and go over what's going to happen
with the Meroux?

Could we do it tomorrow?
I'm kind of beat.

Sure.
Yeah.

Oh, and, Chris,

I appreciate all you've done.

I won't forget it.

(starts engine)

(quiet music playing)
(laughter)

You guys didn't have to
get me anything.

Well, I thought
it would be apropos

to open a bottle of YN
for your birthday.

It's from all of us.

Well, then to all of us.

Happy birthday.

Thank you.
Thanks for coming, guys.

Did you get everything you wanted
for your birthday?

A new blend...
which is delicious...

YN campaign

and you.

Wow, I think I just
threw up in my mouth.

Oh, why don't you just
leave them alone?

At least they're in love.

What's your problem?

You are my problem.

You know, I have feelings

and they are broken.

Jennifer: Okay.

I can't believe I have to
keep explaining to him

what friends with benefits are.

Maybe one more time.

Jennifer: Yeah, one more time.
Excuse me.

Happy birthday.
Thank you.

Wow.

Awkward.

Isn't it lovely to see true love just
blossom right in front of our eyes?

More cake for us, right?

Is it the ex-girlfriend again?
Because I'm telling you,

this time I'm not gonna be
as nice about it.

Well, hello there, Wendy.

Hello.

How's everything at the Chateau?

It's been a challenge.

Oh, yeah, I tried to warn you.

But we're gonna be okay.

My son tells me
you're launching a new wine.

Who's your son?

Oh, that one.

He didn't tell you?

Chris was quite eager
when I asked him

to keep an eye on you.

He's been a big help

keeping me apprised
of all the goings on at the Chateau.

But I must say,
launching a new wine...

that will be difficult.

It's not something
for an amateur.

Stop, please.

The farther you drive it
into the ground,

the cheaper it will be
for me to buy it.

I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to this.

Hmm.

Wendy.
No.

Wendy.
Don't touch me.

I trusted you.

Look, I know and I'm sorry,
but my dad...

Please don't give me
that dad crap.

Aren't you an adult?

You lied to me.

I didn't exactly lie to you.

Spying on me?

And what was that whole
romance thing?

I mean, were you just trying
to get some ass on the side or...?

That's not true.
Don't touch me.

You wanted me to sell, right?

I mean, that's why you
asked me out in the first place?

When were you gonna
tell me the truth?

It's complicated.

Complicated? Okay.

You know, that's something
that a little boy would say,

not a grown man.

Wendy.

(thunder rumbling)

You'd better figure out
whose side you're on.

# Every time fall comes around #

# I picture #

# The way we used to be #

# Before you lied #

# If forgetting you #

# Really was that easy #

# Why does falling in love #

# Still seem so scary? #


Please go away.

Wendy, it's Roy Hutchinson.
We need to talk.

Can we please do this tomorrow?

Wendy, this is serious.

The bank has canceled
your line of credit.

They've frozen everything.

Who are you,
the harbinger of doom?

With the loss of all that wine,

they won't give you
any more money.

We were so close.

You've got to make a payment
to the bank,

otherwise they're gonna
foreclose.

The other option
is to sell to Nathan.

I'm really, really sorry.


Hey.
Hi.

What's all this?

Cards.

I guess my father kept them
after they were returned.

Are you okay?

No.

I mean, I just started
to get to know him through all of this.

Now it's gonna be taken away.

You're not gonna lose the winery.

Yeah, I am.
Roy stopped by last night.

Our line of credit
has been frozen

because we lost so much
of the wine stock.

We have no money...

literally.

I'm gonna have to
let the workers go.

Wendy, this isn't you.

Of course it's me.

Things get hard and I give up.

No, the minute you walked
through that door,

you had all sorts of garbage
thrown at you,

and you've made it work.

There's always a way.

You really believe that?

I wouldn't be sitting here
if I didn't.


I really do love it here.

So let's get you a cup of coffee,
maybe a shower,

and we'll figure all of this out.

All right.

Wait.

Let me see that.

Winner of the Oakville
Premium Gold Medal.

Yeah, so?

The winner gets a contract
with a major distributor.

That would be enough
to keep the bank at bay.

And all we have to do
is win the gold medal.

I didn't say it would be easy.

# We probably shouldn't talk #

# 'Cause talking leads to thinking #

# And eyes wide open #

# Blank in the dark #

# We probably shouldn't think #

# 'Cause thinking leads
to questioning #

# And circles you right back
to the start #

# Everything used to make sense #

# We're testing it
and all of our strength #

# Oh, no #

# If we don't leave now #

# We will fall #

# We'll regret #

# What we've done #

# To ourselves. #

Announcer: Welcome to
the Oakvale wine competition.

Enjoy your day of tasting
the region's finest.

Come on.

If they win the gold,
we'll never get the Meroux.

You promised me those grapes.

Don't worry, I've taken precautions.

Wendy: Tell me
we're gonna be okay.

Jennifer: We're gonna be okay.

Now make me believe it.

Do I look like a hypnotist?

Announcer: Will entrants please
bring their wines to the judging booth?

All wines to the judging booth.

Thank you. Good luck.
Thank you.

So these are the judges
I have to impress?

Yeah, the judges are
all major distributors.

Okay, let's do it.

All right.

Hello.

You're Jerry's daughter.

He was a good man.

So I've heard.

We are entering a blend
this year.

He would be so proud.

Thank you.

Now we wait.

And pray.

Wait here.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
the wine competition

will begin in a few moments
at the main judges' tent.

You have some balls,
showing up here.

I can't do this now.

It's not enough
that you broke her heart?

You have to destroy everything
she's worked so hard for, too?

I don't have time for this.

I'm seeing red, Chris.
When I see red, the claws come out.

That's fine. Fine. Kill me later.
There's something I gotta do.

Hey, hey, hey.
No, Wendy.

Give me the bottle, Chris.
You don't understand.

No, I do understand you.
Stop.

What are you doing?
Wendy.

Look, serve a fresh bottle.

You don't have much time.
Go. Go.

Good luck.

Give it to me.

Give it to me.
What's going on?

And the winner in the under-$10
white wine category is

the Campus Oaks chardonnay.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

And in the under-$10

red wine category:

Bronze... Campus Oaks;

silver... YN by Chateau Meroux;

and gold...

Rabbit's Leap.

Gold is Rabbit's Leap.

Congratulations.
Nathan: Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you.

Today marks

a new beginning
for the Landry family.

Our family's legacy

was built on honesty

and devotion to quality.

Not a lot of old vine Zinfandel
at Rabbit's Leap, is there?

We all make sacrifices

in order to get what we want.

You're right.

Wow.

Our tradition of excellence

has been handed down
from generation to generation.

Hold it. Hold it. Just stop.
What?

Rabbit's Leap can't win
a serious contest.

All they make is boxed wine.
He cheated.

What? That's ridiculous.

He put one of his labels
on an expensive bottle.

This is completely inappropriate.

If Rabbit's Leap won fairly,

then any of their bottles should taste
just as good as the one the judges got.

Of course.

Chris: Choose another bottle
from his tent.

Tell me if it's the same wine.
This is outrageous.

Choose another bottle.

Pick one.

There has been a mistake.

The real winner is

YN by Chateau Meroux.


Your distribution contract.

Wow.

You know, we're actually
gonna be launching

a whole new line
with the Meroux's grapes.

When you have a moment later,
young lady,

come back to the booth
and we'll talk.

Great.

You did it.
You saved the Chateau.

Hey, you know we all did it...
you, Romario.

Yeah, Romario.

He's turned into a complete chick.

Oh, poor you.

Hey, it's not funny.

When did I suddenly become
the man in my relationship?

Maybe when you started
objectifying him.

That was so not nice.

Will you just go talk to him?

Do I have to?
Yes. Move it.


I can't believe
you threw everything away

for some woman.

She's not just some woman.

Consider yourself fired.

No son of mine
betrays his own family.

Goodbye, Christopher.

Romario, hey.

Listen...

I've been listening
and you say the same...

Don't. Don't say anything.

Don't say anything.
Okay.

I've been treating you the way
that men have always treated me.

And the truth is

I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

Are you sure?

Yeah, I'm sure.

I'm sorry.

I'm hoping that we can
put this all behind us and move on.

Say please.

<i>Por favor.</i>

All right.

# I will adore you #

# When you are old #

# I'll always be your blanket #

# When you get cold #

# I'd walk through fire for you #

# Even if it hurt #

# 'Cause if food was
all there was to feed my soul... #

I thought I might find you here.

# You'd be my favorite dessert. #

There's no excuse
for what I did.

It was horrible, despicable.

Don't forget cowardly.

I really screwed up.

Sorry about your dad.

That couldn't have been easy.

It was the right thing to do.

That made it a bit easier.

I spent so many years

just being angry at my father.

I don't want to be angry anymore.

It sure is beautiful.

I'm gonna miss coming out here.

Well, if there's one thing
I've learned,

it's never too late
to start over.

You don't happen to have
an indentured servitude program, do you?

We're actually looking for
a new winemaker.

Why? Are you looking
to work off your debt?

It depends on how long
that will take.

It's gonna take a long time...

a really long time.

You might have to get
a little dirty.

I think I can handle that.

# You are my favorite dessert #

# How I adore you #

# You are my favorite dessert. #

Chris: It's never boring
around you, is it?

Wendy: Not if I can help it.

# I would love to be #

# The one you lean on #

# I would love to wear #

# Your ring #

# You're the thing I need #

# You're the food that feeds me #

# I need you #

# More than anything #

# I would love to share #

# Your world #

# Can I offer you #

# The moon? #

# Are you ready to be loved #

# Morning, night and afternoon? #

# There's only one thing
left tonight #

# To satisfy this girl #

# Walk beside me, follow, guide me,
get inside me #

# I want to share your world #

# I want to share your world #

# I want to share
your world. #

Are we gonna get "Action!"
Or are we supposed to just go?

I think we just go.
We just go. Okay.

Yeah.
Okay, copy that.

All right.

Is it way windier than ever
right now?

It feels way windier.

I'm eating hair.

Oh, my Lord.

All right. And action!

Yeah, sorry, guys.

I guess we forgot to do that.
We're really smart.

(both laughing)

That was a good rehearsal.

Well, honestly, I just need to know
if I should bring my Mace in or not.

Yeah, it's mint-scented.

The guy before you...

(laughing)
Whoa.

I have something really funny to say,
but it's not appropriate.

It's not appropriate.
Okay, sorry.

So where are you taking me tonight?

Somewhere cheap and dirty

or expensive and downright filthy?

(yelps)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

What happened? What happened?

I think that just came off...

the camera just almost
came off the mount.

Oh, dear Lord.

Oh, the boat and the wine.

Ooh.

Man: And action!

Man over radio: Radio check.

10-4, baby.

Copy that.

Man over radio: Wait for this red light,
then go.

I think it's gonna turn green.

I'm gonna keep going.

See this? Watch.

Blink blink blink. Bitches.

Man: Okay, and...

All right, dig on in.

Ooh, I think I'll have an olive.

That seems safe.

Oh, okay.

Man over radio: When you go,
"Not up for a little adventure?"

Just kind of share
a little bit of a look.

I can't tell from back here.

Oh, dude, dude, we're on it.

I mean, it's (bleep) amazing.
We're rocking the (bleep) out of it.

You look great.

(laughs, spits)

(bleep)
(laughing)

(bleep).
I couldn't swallow.

Man over radio: We'll go again.

And on the, "Now it's late," just...

I have nothing to say.

(both laugh)

You did.
You had something to say.

Hey, listen, after this
I'll take you out to...

I'll take you to the KFC
and the A& W.

(southern accent)
Can I get a root beer?

Man: What are you doing?
(crew laughing)

Sorry. Move along.

I still don't know your name.

It's Wendy.

I still don't know your name.

It's Wendy.

It's Wendy. It's Wendy.

Mark.

Man: Action!


Man: Action!

Oh.
Amanda: That was close.

Man: Action!

(man laughs)

That ball was thrown (bleep) hard.
Amanda: I didn't throw that one.

I did not throw that one.
I promise. That was so not me.

Oh. What the...?

What did you do that for?

Amanda: You, out of the pool.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Amanda: Oh, no. Oh, no.

Man: And action!

(crew laughing)

I don't know.

Ooh. Argh. Friend.


Dad.

Man: Action!

(crew laughing)

You guys are funny.

Man: Moving on. Moving on.

# I will adore you #

# When you are old #

# I'll always be your blanket #

# When you get cold #

# I'd walk through fire for you #

# Even if it hurt #

# 'Cause if food was all there was #

# To feed my soul #

# You'd be my favorite dessert #

# I will wait for you #

# If I die first #

# I'll always be the water #

# To quench your thirst #

# If you were drowning #

# I'd jump after you #

# Head first #

# 'Cause if food was all there was #

# To feed my soul #

# You'd be my favorite dessert #

# I'll always #

# Remember #

# Who you are #

# And how this feels #

# 'Cause I memorized your soul #

# And if I put you in a bowl #

# You'd be my favorite dessert #

# How I adore you #

# You are my favorite dessert #

# I hunger for you #

# You are my favorite dessert #

# I will wait for you #

# You are my favorite dessert #

# How I adore you #

# You are my favorite dessert. #
