Mabel Simmons, you're under arrest.
What the- What the What?

That's the criminal right there.
What did I do?

Well, for starters,
excessive damage to public property.

Two bench warrants.
What I ever do to a bench?

25 unpaid parking tickets.
An unpaid speeding ticket.

Beautiful clay, isn't it'? Very mild.

Nice, cool breeze
blovvin' through my hair.

That ain't gonna work.

And as if all those charges
arerft bad enough...

you harassed two poor,
innocent children.

Hovv does the defendant plead?

Now, Your Honor, these children
needed to learn some respect.

And with me as their teacher,
guess What?

They learned quick.
Yes, they did. Yes, they did.

Guilty!
Your Honor-

Knookin' clown a poor, innocent lady.
Guilty!

I better not run into them in a dark alley,
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

Guilty, guilty, guilty!

Your Honor!
Guilty!

Bring in the box.

Ooh, this is fancy.

I hope this ain't lunch.

This time, Ms. Simmons...

we have a very appropriate
sentence for you.

What's this?

You gonna put me on house arrest again?

Oh, no, Your Honor. Go easy on me.

That's more like my punishment.

You need to learn to be an example
to the neighborhood.

What? You cannot be serious.

That's hovv come
I chased these children-

to teach them to
take care of their neighborhood.

Judge, you crazy.

Ms. Simmons, you wrecked
a whole city block!

Does that sound like
taking care of your neighborhood?

Well, if the city had been a better block,
then the block vvouldrft have got ruined...

and I vvouldrft be up in here
with your blockhead, Judge.

It's time you learned to
do things the right Way.

I do things the right Way.
I do 'em the left Way too.

<i>You bad, Medea.</i>

That's why you're here, Ms. Simmons.

I'm gonna teach you
hovv to do good in a good Way.

Why? ls Santa watching?

Do you Want to do good for this community?
Yes, sir.

Wonderful.

Please bring them to me. Please.

No, Ms. Simmons,
I Want you to make a difference...

Without making a mess.

Make a difference Without making a mess?
Court dismissed.

Well, this does not bode well with me.

That stupid judge. If he thinks I'm actually
going through vvith this, he must be crazy.

Everybody up in here crazy except me.

Now, Maclea,

Get over there.
Now, right now. Do it.

Wow. Would you look at that.
Taking me back to the old days.

I was so sweet and innocent.

Excuse me, young man.
What exactly do you think you're doing?

Getting lunch, stupid.

You forgot your lunch.

That was something.

I gave my first black eye

Such fond memories.
Where does the time go?

From the looks of it, those doors

But While I'm here,

We ain't listenin' to a worcl you say.

I have had enough of you, little girl.

This will put me over the edge.

My partner will see to it that it does.

Freedom Park.

I forgot my purse.

You might end up choking on this bacon.

'Cause every time I eat it,
I start to itch.

Okay, I need my oxygen.

All right, Maclea. Now, I went clown
to that child welfare office...

to talk about finding those kids
a proper home...

just like you asked me to.

Mm-hmm.
But then... something happened.

<i>And I just said to myself...</i>

<i>â€œSelf, what would the man upstairs
do in this situation?â€œ</i>

<i>And I just couldn't leave
that poor, helpless dog.</i>

Barn, stop sitting there lyin'.
Tell the truth.

You forgot to go to Child Welfare.
I mighfve.

Now, you go clown to Child Welfare
early in the morning...

and get some help for these kids,

<i>We gem' somewhere?</i>

Yes. Have some bacon and eggs. This is
called breakfast. You didn't know that?

We dorft Want your charity.

<i>Now, Medea, stay cook.</i>

Little girl, look here.
I know you're tough and I respect that.

But y'all kids need some nourishment.

Now sit clown at this table...

and shove some of this food in your mouth
before I shove it in your mouth for ya-

I'm sorry.
Yes, sit dovvn and eat something.

Then I'll take y'all to the youth center.

Unless you get a hold of Social Services.

Come on, D.

Oh, can I get some bacon

Come on, D.

<i>Whom-hoe, she a hasâ€œ; one.
She a feisty one.</i>

I'm about to be feisty on your face,

Look here, Barn.
Them children need a home.

Now get clown to that welfare office.

Get clown there.
Break into it if you have to.

And dorft get caught up in no â€œbureau-facy.â€
Get them children somewhere to stay.

Well, your suspensions shot.
You've been taking bumps too fast.

But I haverft. I swear.

That's tight.

I carft believe y'all slept

Yeah. l-low freaky was that'?

Did she try to eat you?
I bet she tried to eat you.

It was a'ight.

Somebody let you ihto her home
and you thank her by walking out oh her?

Man, I told you vve dorft need you here.

Oh, that's right.
You dorft need help from nobody.

How's that vvorkin' out for you?

That's What I thought.

Honey, you go around
mad at the world all your life...

the world airft gonna care about you.

The world already doesrft care
about me, about nobody.

You right for the most part, honey.
Most times the world dorft care.

But there are lots of people that <i>0'0...</i>

and you have to recognize
when somebody really cares.

Do you understand, little girl?

Boy, What you do- Gimme this ball.

Novv, if you gonna dribble, do it right.
You see that?

Barn.

Do it right.

And that's why vve need

and the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

What in the hello is this?

Betsy Holiday for mayor.

And I'm Madea...

Now, Maclea, I assure you,
I will not get the heck out of your gym...

Save? What you mean save?

I'm going to make sure
that you children...

and all the other children
in this neighborhood...

for many, many, many years to come.

Can we have those smoothie robot
vending machines?

And wheelchair ramps?

And smoothie robot vending-
Oh, vvait.

<i>So, we dent need
the pnze money anymore'?</i>

No, my dear.
Betsy is going to take care of everything.

Now look here, Hairdo, or l-lair-clon't,
whatever that is on you-

What is that on your head'?
ls something living- Excuse me.

From What I've seen,
when somebody walks in your door...

saying they're gonna fix all your problems,
they're usually up to somethin'.

Isn't that right'?

This place needs a helping hand.

That's Where I come in.

Girl, get outta here. Dorft act like
you know What this place needs.

You airft from around here.
You didn't grow up here.

You didn't give nobody a black eye
in that corner. I did.

You dorft know What you're talking about.
I'll tell you What I'm not.

A criminal.

This communityÃ©
been burned by Mayor Thomas...

but I assure you under Mayor Holiday-

things will be different.

Just take a look at What I've done
to Chastain Park.

Now, now, if you can follow me outside...

we can start the cleanup process.

As mayor, I'll do vvhafs necessary...

to clean up these streets.

And we'll do it by recycling!

Children, vve goin' for a ride.

I Want you to see something.
Welcome to the beautiful Chastain Park.

Welcome to Chastain Park.

Perp alert. Perp alert.

This place is tight.
For reals.

Dang.
We could sleep here and no one would notice.

Look at all these wheelchair ramps!

This must be What heaven is like
if God was in a wheelchair.

But I guess He vvouldrft be. He's God.

I mean, if he got in an accident,
he could just fix himself.

Focus, young man.

Y'all see a park anywhere?

What about that little patch of grass?

Man, there used to be
some sick courts over here.

This looks less like Chastain Park...

and more like Chastain Park-ing Lot.

Y'all gonna call me out
on myjoke like that?

Okay, fine. But that was funny.
I tickle myself.

Help!

Come on, Dang Dang, come on.

Ooh, that Betsy Holiday.
She wants to do this to Freedom Park.

I dorft know who she thinks she's helping.

Whatever happened to community?
It's right there.

Not that kind of community. Real community.
It's right there.

Boy, I ain't talkin' about no store.

I'm talking about community.

If that Holiday â€œrestoresâ€ Freedom Park...

vve can say good-bye to our youth center
and to our community.

There vvorft be nothin' but fancy stores.

I think I'm gonna pay
Miss Betsy a little visit.

Ooh. Ominous.

Y'all ladies need some help stretchin'?

Hey!

This gon' have to be quick.

And the last piece of the puzzle
is the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

Our polling shows that this community
is favoring your new initiative.

Perfect.

So if you secure the park,
you'll secure the mayofis office.

Hello.

Madea, please come in before you freeze.

Zip it, lippit. Betsy, I took a little
trip clown to Chastain Park today.

Or should I say Chastain Park-mg Lot'?

I knew y'all were gonna laugh.

Will you excuse us for a moment?

All right, Madea.

I've had about all I can take from you.

Girl, you ugly when you mad.

<i>Oh, you cam stop Ms, Medea.</i>

It's what the people want.
it's what the voters want.

In two Weeks, that park will be mine.

Oh, really? Okay, Betsy.

VVell, I think this $251100 prize...

will be enough to pay for those building
improvements you were talking about.

What you think?
Those kids dorft stand a chance.

I've created my own team,
just to make sure.

Girl, What crazy you talkin' about?

The Chastain Park Players.

Super athletes, you know.

Please, we could take on
those robots any clay.

If you dorft stay out of my way...

I'm gonna bury you.

Oh, look here.
Betsy got some street in her, I see.

Oh, no, I do not.

Oh, looks like your ride is here.

You're gonna have to come with us.

No, you don't understand.
That Woman is gonna tear dovvn the center.

You mean the future mayor of this city?

Let's go.
Come on, Madea.

There ya go.
Thanks, man.

That lady's gonna tear this place dovvn.

Yeah, and build stores

Why arerft y'all practicin'
for the Youth Center Games?

We need to vvin that prize money.

What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

That disgusting Holiday Woman

unless this place gets shutdown.

You mean <i>when</i> it gets shutdown.

No, it's not when it gets shut clown.
it's not gonna get shut clown.

Y'all are gonna win that prize money...

and get this building up to code.

Do you understand? You can do it.

Ankle bracelet lady
might be on to something, y'all.

We're just gonna lose.

Son, if you dorft try,
you've already lost.

Yeah, that's What I'm saying.

Listen, if you try your hardest
and do your absolute best...

I guarantee you will save this place,
but you're gonna have to work hard.

My juice box has a guarantee.

Oh, no, this is a better guarantee, honey.

This is a Madea guarantee.
You can take that to the bank.

That means something.
You better ask some people.

Now who's with me'?
Come on, who with me'?

See? I can follow them rules...
good-lookin'.

She's talkin' about me.
No, no, no, no. She's talking about me.

Okay, you know What?
You're delusional, man.

I'm delusional?
No, <i>you're</i> delusional, my friend.

Now, the key to winning is- loam.

Now, the key to winning is- loam.

Mabel, that spells â€œpee.â€
Thank you, Joe.

Oh, not to worry, sir.
I-I'll think of something.

You better!

If I dorft get my mall,

And I'll kick you back out onto
the streets Where I found you.

Do you remember that, Betsy-vvetsy?

No, please dorft, sir.

Please.

And I can break you.

Have I made myself clear?

Good, Chris.
You're actually starting to make some.

And, Lacey, you're scary. That's good.

<i>Medea, Medea, Medea!</i>

I finally got in touch

Come on, D.

But I thought we were going back

Navv, I'm not letting her split us up.
Let's go.

Oh, they'll be here soon.
They probably got stuck at the library.

D, look at these shoes.

We need a sugar mama.

I promise you I'm gonna find you
someplace safe to sleep soon.

I'm gonna find you a real home.

D!

Hey!

Dang Dang!

Grab my hand!

No!

On your mark.

Get set.

Joe!

Where did y'all sleep last night?
Why do you care?

We received an anonymous tip
that they were sleeping at the park.

Little girl, I was Worried sick.

We looked everywhere for y'all.
Apparently not.

Okay, that is it.
I have held back for as long as I could.

What you need is a good old spankin' from

Oh, girl, girl. You gonna get it now.

Put me down!
Let go of my sister!

Hey! Hey!
Ow! Ow!

Yeah, give it to her good!

Ms. Simmons, What are you doing?

Children, cover your eyes.

No, I wanna see this.

I know you ain't show up on my turf again.
You ain't gonna nun these kids.

Oh, Madea, so colorful.

But I'm here on a mission of love.

You know,
when I was here the other clay...

I was particularly inspired
by two of your children.

There's nothing
that breaks my heart more...

than seeing children Without a home.

That's why I'm going to adopt
little Delinquinetta here...

and her brother Dang Dang.

What?

And from What I savv earlier,
it looks like I arrived just in time.

Child abuse, Madea?
Mm-hmm.

â€œMrs. Anonymous Tip,â€ huh?

You are just terrible, using these children
just to get your face on the TV-ision.

You know, Ms. Simmons...

someones gotta keep these kids
from being split apart.

So What does this mean?

It means, dear, that you
and your little brother Dang Dang...

will finally have a suitable home.

It is time to settle this the Madea Way.

Isn't that what got you in trouble
in the first place?

I think you've just shown us all...

that these children are much better off
with a law-abiding caretaker.

Come here, dear.

I brought you some
â€œWelcome to the familyâ€ presents.

For you.

Whoa! Dang!

Sugar mama.

And for you.

These are for me?

Oh, go on, try them on.

That was the shoes conforming precisely...

to the shape of your foot.

Dang!

Girl, take them ugly, gaudy shoes off.
We got to go practice. Come on.

Netta, I know the thing you vvant
more than anything in the world...

is that your brother
have a safe place to live.

Please, let me give you that place.

Honey, dorft you fall for that.

What this Woman is offering you,
that is not a home.

Trust me.
And, What, you are?

You're just trying to get rid of us.

All right, we'll come live with you.

Really?

Oh, wonderful!

Welcome to the family.

What about the rest of us?
What about the games?

I am so sorry to say...

Netta and Dang Dang vvorft be able to
compete with you in the games.

I'm so sorry, children.

What about the center?
We need you guys.

Don't worry, children.

Mayor Betsy will take care of you.

I'm sorry, y'all, but we gotta look out
for our own, you know.

I thought we were your own.

Do something, Madea!

Yeah, come on.
You just carft let this happen.

Well, ain't nothin' I say
gonna change that little girl's mind.

I got nothing in my purse to fix this.

Come along, children. Let's go home.

L-low could you let this happen?

Now there's no way we'll win the games
ancl save the center.

Yeah. Dorft you care about
What happens to them, to the center?

But cryin' never fixed nothin'.

Wonderful.

You just need to embrace
the finer things in life.

Now, clon't bother me.

It's clear that you have
not learned your lesson, Ms. Simmons.

You don't understand, Judge. I was
trying to help. I was trying to help her!

By spanking her? Save it.
We've heard this before.

I dorft Want you anywhere
near those kids or the youth center.

You'll fulfill the rest of your sentence
under house arrest.

No!

I carft do no house arrest.

Those kids need me.

Court dismissed.

Yay! I did it! I did it!

You know, I actually
