WOMAN:
<i>Careful, babe.</i>

<i>Hold her head up.</i>

<i>There you go.</i>

<i>(chuckles)</i>

-Oh.
-(man chuckles)

Today is
my babyâ€™s first day home.

-And this is your daddy.
-(chuckles)

(baby fussing quietly)

(woman chuckles)

Youâ€™re never gonna let her go,
are you?


Are you?

(static crackles)

â™ª â™ª

(sighs softly)


â™ª â™ª

(choking, gasping)

AVA:
Daddy.

-Daddy! Daddy.
-(gasping)

Daddy!

If we can leave
in the next 33 minutes,

we should be able
to make it, okay?

Come on.

-(voices whispering)
-(footsteps departing)

â™ª â™ª

(water dripping)

All right. Okay.

(footsteps approaching)

-AVA: Daddy.
-Hey.

-Come on.
-Karen.

Daddy, Cathy.

-Cathy.
-Okay, Iâ€™m sorry. Sorry.

Sheâ€™s...

She is...

sheâ€™s my boss of...

12 years?

And Iâ€™m her lead photographer.

Good. Very good.
Remember, eye contact.

Donâ€™t forget to smile.

You have to show her youâ€™re
grateful for the opportunity.

Yeah, uh, eyes, smile.
Got it.

-(sighs): Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

(Ava sighs)

â™ª â™ª

Okay.

Perfect.

Here we go, mister.

-Come on.
-Iâ€™m coming.

Coming, coming, coming, coming.

-Okay. All right.
-Iâ€™ll beat you there!

â™ª â™ª

-15 minutes, Dad!
-Okay.

ASSISTANT (over phone): This is
Dr. Brooksâ€™ office again.

Please let us know
if youâ€™re interested

in joining
the cognitive research study.

A slot just opened up,

-so we thought weâ€™d reach out.
-(scoffs)

We have 12 minutes.

Yep, Iâ€™m ready, Iâ€™m ready.
Yeah, Iâ€™m ready.

-No, thank you. Iâ€™m okay.
-You need breakfast.

-Iâ€™m fine. Thank you.
-I wasnâ€™t asking.

All right.
Thank you, thank you.

Mm, mm, mm.

You used to do it tighter.

(door opens)

â™ª â™ª

(dog barking in distance)

(Ava sighs)


Hey, uh... look,
Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m really sorry about

raising my voice
the other night.

I know, Dad.
Youâ€™re just sick.

Yeah, but itâ€™s still
no exc...

Dad!

Come on.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

-Itâ€™s a...
-Wait. Wait.

Wait.

(gearshift clicks)

Minute to spare. Not bad.

-(sighs): Okay.
-Whereâ€™d you get that?

-You donâ€™t smoke.
-Oh.

Okay. I thought I...

(grabs cigarette pack)

(laughs softly)

Okay.

I guess I donâ€™t smoke.

Look, just be yourself
and smile.

Eye contact, you know.

I-I got it.

Want to try the handshake again?

Itâ€™ll come back.

-Good morning.
-Hi. Hi.

(quiet chatter)

(phone ringing)

WOMAN: So, go on
and have a seat right here,

and sheâ€™ll be right with you.

NOLAN:


-CATHY: Nolan.
-Hi.

Weâ€™ve known each other
too long for that.

-Oh.
-Come here.

(Cathy sighs)

Have a seat.

Thank you.

Wow.

(both laugh)

We all did not think
you were gonna make it.

Howâ€™s Ava?

Oh, good.

-Yeah?
-Sheâ€™s great. Um...

You know, sheâ€™s handling
everything really well.

Running the house, running me.

-Sheâ€™s just like her mom.
-Uh-huh.

Rachel was always so pointed
in the office.

But... (sighs) her stories.

So rich.

So much nuance.

Iâ€™m sorry.

No, no, no, itâ€™s okay.
I, um...

Itâ€™s actually nice
to hear those things.

Itâ€™s partially why I thought
itâ€™d be good to be back here.

Um, so, anyway,
I-I brought some newer samples,

and I thought
it would help with some...

Look, Nolan, they just told me--

the publisher
will not sign off on it.

What?

Itâ€™s just that
your latest photos

donâ€™t reach the level
of your past work.

Oh, uh, well, I mean,
I have newer samples

I can show you
if you just tell me

-what you need me to...
-Nolan.

I know you need this--
believe me--

but itâ€™s just not
like it used to be.

Budgets are tight, and...

(voice fading):
theyâ€™re not gonna sign off

unless they can justify it.

(horn honking repeatedly)

Fuck!

Uh, hi. Hi.

Iâ€™m sorry.
Is... is Dr. Yeboah available?

-Sure. Just have a seat.
-Okay, thank you.

Sorry.

WOMAN:
Watch your foot.

(woman speaking quietly)

â™ª â™ª

Nol.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-Hey, no, stop that.
-Hmm.

You are too talented
to let this get to you.

Come on.
Letâ€™s go get some food.

Yeah.

So, uh, whatâ€™s the plan now?

I donâ€™t know.
No publication will even see me.

-You know I can spot you
if you need. -No.

-No, no, no. Iâ€™m fine.
-You sure?

Yes, Iâ€™m fine. Thereâ€™ll...
Thereâ€™ll be other jobs.

Okay.

So, you gonna tell me what
happened to your hand or...?

I donâ€™t know. I just, uh...


I got frustrated,
punched a wall.

-Bill collector. Who cares?
-(chuckles)

Since when do you hit anything?

What do you mean?

I-Iâ€™ve never seen you
lose your cool before.

(cell phone ringing)

Okay, okay.


-(ringing stops)
-And another one.

-(phone drops on table)
-Another doctor?

Yep.

Maybe we should take
Dr. Brooks up on her offer.

I know sheâ€™s pushy,
but maybe I was wrong.

I said that studies are risky,

but we tried all
the traditional doctors, right?

And sheâ€™s one of the leading
researchers in her field.

I mean, we should
give it a shot, right?


You donâ€™t need
to change your career, Nol.

You just need to remember
who you are again.

Hmm?

Iâ€™m, uh, Dr. Yeboah with Ortho.

You think the doctor
can squeeze my friend in?

-Um...
-Hi. Uh, Nolan Wright.

Oh, yes. Sheâ€™s with a patient
right now, but let me see.

-Thank you. Appreciate it.
-(pager beeping)


-Sorry. I got to get back.
-Mm-hmm.

-Just feel it out, all right?
-Uh-huh.

WOMAN (over TV): ...American
Academy of Neurology

and the American
Neuropsychiatric Association.

-(sighs)
-Please welcome to the stage

this yearâ€™s keynote speaker,
Dr. Lillian Brooks.

(applause on TV)

Clinically,
this man is brain-dead.

But the brain is stronger
than you think.

What youâ€™re seeing is

the primitive visualization
of a memory.

Ten years ago, my team
developed this technology

for people just like him.

People left to die.

People everyone gave up on.

The question now is:
Can we wake them up?

And that question
has led to the development

of our most recent device.

-Dr. Brooks will see you now.
-Oh. Okay.

Thank you.

Thanks.


Hello.

Hi.

Come in. Have a seat.

(door closes)

(recorder beeps)

Nolan Wright, 33 years old.

Involved in a car accident
six months ago

resulting in
the death of his wife

and extensive injury
to his cranium

and medial temporal lobe.

He was found unresponsive
at the scene

and remained in a comatose
state for three days.

On the third day,
he regained consciousness

with severe memory loss.

Iâ€™m sorry about your wife.

I know how devastating it is
to lose someone you love.

But I am glad that you finally
decided to come in.

I know itâ€™s frustrating
seeing so many doctors.

Right. And-and do you think
this will help with my amnesia?

Well, your head seems to have
healed nicely.

You shouldnâ€™t have even
survived this.

-(flipping through papers)
-(sighs) Letâ€™s see.

You have done the EMDR.

Hmm. Neurological feedback,
cognitive therapy.

All of this is good,
but what we do here goes deeper.

What is it...
what is it that you do here?

Before I explain the therapy,

I need to confirm that
the pathway to your memories

isnâ€™t totally corrupted.

Yeah, how-how do you plan
on doing that?

Have you ever
experienced hypnosis?

â™ª â™ª

Okay. I want you to sit up
and relax, please.

(scoffs softly)

And let your muscles fall
into the seat.

(sighs softly)

You just let your muscles fall
into the seat.

Uh-huh.

Relax, and let go
of everything around you.

And focus on that.

Just focus.


Just focus on that.

That is all that matters.

Let it lead you in.

Now focus on its center.

And let your eyelids fall.

Your eyes are getting heavier.

Let them fall.

Let them rest.

â™ª â™ª

(panting softly)

â™ª â™ª

What is this?

(watch clicks)

(watch ticking)

(panting softly)

(sharp crunching)

Whoâ€™s there?

(watch continues ticking)

(crunching continues)

-(panting quietly)
-(crunching continues)

-(shouts)
-(fingers snapping)

(watch clicks, ticking stops)

(Nolan panting)

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s all right. Youâ€™re out.

Youâ€™re-youâ€™re done.


What did you see?

What did you--
Whatâ€™d you do to me?

-Nothing.
-No, donâ€™t bullshit.

That-Thatâ€™s the same thing
I keep seeing in my nightmares.

Thereâ€™s something...
Someone-someone was in there.

Who the hell was in there?

Mr. Wright, this exercise

simply transports you
to your deep subconscious.

And in the years
that Iâ€™ve been doing this,

nobody ever sees anything.

Until after multiple sessions,
maybe, but you...

see something that fast?

Your subconscious is active.

Your brain is not as handicapped
as you think it is.

Those memories are there.

Theyâ€™re deep, but theyâ€™re there.

can reverse your condition.

â™ª â™ª

Yeah, uh...

I-I need to think about it.

(door opens)

Is there anyone else
who can pick you up?

Maybe your father forgot again.

Heâ€™s just running
a little late today.

Thatâ€™s all.

Itâ€™s 30 degrees out here.

Why donâ€™t we wait inside?

Actually, itâ€™s 42 right now.

It wonâ€™t be dropping to the 30s
until next week.

(doorbell rings)

Ava.

Hey. Hey.

-Hey. Iâ€™m so, so sorry.
-Donâ€™t.

I know youâ€™ve got
a lot going on, Mr. Wright,

but this is number three.

If this happens again,

weâ€™re gonna have to notify
child services.


Hey.

Look...

Iâ€™m sorry I forgot. I just...

I guess, um...

they changed their mind
about the job,

and I got distracted.

AVA: Iâ€™m sorry for making
your life so difficult, Dad.

-(Ava crying)
-What?

Ava, Ava,
why would you say that?

You got so angry at me
yesterday,

and then forgot me again today.

I thought you might be
really annoyed of me.

Hey, Ava, look at me.

Ava, look at me.

Ava.

Iâ€™m not annoyed with you at all.

Iâ€™m sick. Thatâ€™s it.

Okay?

If it wa... if it wasnâ€™t
for you, who knows where Iâ€™d be?

You say that all the time.

I think I should go make
some dinner.

Hey, no, come on, you donâ€™t
have to make dinner tonight.

But I do.

Who else will?

BROOKS: <i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with the term "life review"?</i>

No.

Itâ€™s a phenomenon
reported by many

after a near-death experience,

where your life flashes
before your eyes.

I believe that that flash
contains key memories

that replay on a constant loop
all the time.

Uh-huh.

So, putting you directly
into those memories

is the focus of this therapy.

Iâ€™m sorry, put, uh...

Wh-What do you mean,
put me in those memories?

Come with me, please.

We call this headset
the Black Box.

First, I put you under hypnosis
to open up your subconscious.

And this EEG will read
your brain waves

and send them to a processor
inside here.

This processor will extract

those key memories
from your brain waves

and convert each memory into
an immersive virtual experience.

Okay, like-like a hologram?

More like a dream,
like walking in your own shoes.

Itâ€™ll feel real.

The goal...

is to put you into as many of
those key memories as possible

-until you wake up.
-(typing)

NOLAN:
Okay, uh, h-how long will it be

before I see results?

Well, depends on how
you respond to the therapy.

Maybe a few weeks.

Okay.
I donâ€™t have a few weeks.

I need to be able
to take care of my daughter.

Well, if we both
burn the midnight oil,

I think you could see
improvement sooner.

You good to go?

Okay.

â™ª â™ª


BROOKS:
Okay.

(steady beeping)

Transferring directly into
and out of the trance stage

can be pretty jarring,
so I like to begin

with something I call
the safe room.

Imagine it as your core,

a place where you are
completely comfortable,

where nothing can harm you.

A secret place
that only you can enter.

-You got it?
-Got it.

Good.

Weâ€™re ready to begin
the session.

Iâ€™ll count you in.

Relax.

Look forward.

And you should see a cursor.

Uh-huh. I do.

When the cursor moves,
focus on its movement.

Let it relax you.


BROOKS:
Thereâ€™s nothing now.

No lab.

No room. No chair.

Only the sound of my voice
and the cursor.

Pay attention to your feet,

your legs, your arms.

Theyâ€™re getting heavier--
too heavy.

But it feels good.

Let that feeling wash over
your entire body.

The closer the cursor gets,
the deeper you go.

The deeper you go,
the better you will feel.

The better you feel,
the deeper you will go.

In ten seconds,
youâ€™ll be in your safe room.

Ten, nine, eight, seven,

six, five,

four, three, two,

one.

(static crackling)

Nolan, are you in
your safe room?

Youâ€™re gonna have to guide me.

I canâ€™t see anything.


-(panting)
-You hear me?

Uh...

Yes.

Yes, I can.

Good.

Now, remember,
nothing can harm you here.

But do not go out the door.

I can only count you out
from inside this room.

You hear me?

I need you to understand this.

I will not be able to bring
you back if you leave, okay?

-Understood.
-Good.

So, now I want you to imagine
an analog watch.

And when you do, it should
appear in the room with you.

(watch ticking)

(Nolan gasps softly)

From this room,
youâ€™re going to go

deeper into your subconscious.

Beyond this point, we will not
be able to communicate anymore.

When you push the crown
of the watch,

you will be in
one of your memories.

Focus on it.

Concentrate.

Let it come back to you.

Whenever you like, you can turn
the crown to another memory.

Forward for the next,
backward for the previous one.

If at any time
you feel uncomfortable,

push the crown in,
and youâ€™ll be back here.

Nolan, do you understand?

Uh... (chuckles)

Uh, understood.

Understood.

Good.

Are you ready?

Yes.

Yes, I am.

Then push the crown in
and remember.

(shuddering breath)


(organ playing
Wagnerâ€™s "Bridal Chorus")

(footsteps approaching)

(crowd stands)

(quiet murmuring)

â™ª â™ª

Rachel.

Iâ€™ve been waiting so long...

(music distorts)

PRIEST (distorted):
Dearly beloved,

we meet here today
to witness a sacred ceremony.

We are especially blessed
to be joined today

-by their families and friends.
-(sharp crunching)

(voice fading): The groom
and the bride are honored...

-(crunching continues)
-(gasps softly)

â™ª â™ª

-(rapid beeping)
-(static crackles)

-(crunching continues)
-(priest continues indistinctly)

(trembling breaths)




Oh. Relax.

Hey. Hey, hey.

Relax. Youâ€™re back.

A wedding?

What else did you see?


We-we were in an old church.

The-There was a large crowd,
about 50, 70 people.

But all their faces
were blurred.

Blurred?

Yeah. I got out of there as
soon as that thing came at me.

The same thing that you saw
during hypnosis?

-What did it look like?
-I-I donâ€™t know,

but it-it... I guess
it looked like a person,

but it-it didnâ€™t move like one.

I see.

I think most likely
thatâ€™s your brain

trying to protect you
from your trauma.

Itâ€™s trying to keep you
from remembering.

You just have to remember
that that thing is not real.

Next time, weâ€™ll stay
a little longer.

At least one face should appear.

Longer?

Thatâ€™s why youâ€™ve been sick
for so long.

If you can avoid it,
I think we could overcome this.

Listen, I know
this sounds very strange,

especially after having seen
so many other doctors,

but I mean it--
you are doing well.

The level of detail that you saw
in your first session...

that is remarkable.

Now, Iâ€™m committed
to reversing your condition.

I think we can
if we keep pushing.

But I canâ€™t do this
if you donâ€™t trust me.

Okay?

Okay.

<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

Hey.

-Hey. How you doing, bro?
-Come on in.

-Iâ€™m all right, man.
How are you? -You good?

Yeah, Iâ€™m fine, Iâ€™m fine.
You all right?

Iâ€™m okay, yeah.
Handâ€™s healing up.

But Avaâ€™s a little mad
at me, though.

-Ah.
-Is that for us?

-Oh, yeah. I got you, bro.
-Thank you so much.

Ava, got a surprise for you.

GARY:
Hey. Chinese.

So, uh, howâ€™s it going so far?

-Howâ€™s the study?
-Uh, itâ€™s okay.

-Yeah?
-Itâ€™s okay. Yeah.

Iâ€™m still getting used to
all this, but, um...

I, uh... I saw my wedding today.

You did? Your...

You... Thatâ€™s amazing. Nol.

-That-thatâ€™s progress
right there. -Yeah.

You know, uh,
I remember that day, man.

You know, you two
are the only reason

I even considered settling down.

-Were we always that happy?
-Yeah.

You were inseparable.
It was gross.

You and Rachel,
youâ€™d always talk about

this 40-year plan.

Yâ€™all had it mapped out
before you even got engaged.

-Hi, Uncle Gary.
-GARY (chuckles): Hey.

And this munchkin
was the first thing

yâ€™all checked off the list.

You talking about the plan?

-Yeah. You still remember it?
-Yeah.

Yeah, and Iâ€™m gonna get
my first car

-when I turn 16 and a half.
-And a half.

GARY:
Yeah. (laughs)

And sheâ€™s gonna hold you
to that, bro.

-Mm.
-(laughs)

Hey, Ava...

itâ€™s okay to miss her.

You-you donâ€™t have to pretend.

Hey, come here.

Itâ€™s okay.

â™ª â™ª

Huh.

â™ª â™ª

(chopstick clatters on floor)

Hey. Yeah, two. Just...

-Yeah, thank you.
-Thank you.

So...

What is this place?

Thank you.

I brought you here
when you were three.

This was me and your momâ€™s
favorite spot.

Uh-huh.


Here, here.
Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s okay.

Just hold it like this.
All right?

Boom. Wham.

Control it from here.

Take your time.

There you go.
There you... there you go.

Yeah, thatâ€™s-thatâ€™s all right.

Whoa, whoa.
(groans playfully)

(both chuckle)

NOLAN:
Whoa. Thank you.

-Mmm.
-Yeah?

-Itâ€™s good.
-Oh.

Thank you for being patient
with me, Ava.

Okay.


Mmm, yummy.

BROOKS: And you didnâ€™t bring
any back for me?

Oh, well, she barely left any
for me, so...

(both chuckle)

-Where did the two of you go?
-Nise.

Oh.

-I love that place.
-Jealous?


-Extremely.
-(laughing)

All right.

Iâ€™m sorry.
Hey, uh, look, if I stop now,

do you think my memory
would just return naturally?

Well, in the last session,

you reported seeing
blurred faces.

Thatâ€™s a condition
called prosopagnosia.

Itâ€™s a sign of brain damage.

We want to get to the point
where faces appear.

So letâ€™s try to stay
long enough today

to see a face, okay?


Oh, and if that thing
shows up again,

you just say to yourself,

"I run my mind.
It does not run me."

Say it with me.

"I run my mind..."

I run my mind.
It does not run me.

-(watch ticking)
-(static crackles)

-(whooshing)
-(grunts)

(baby crying over monitor)

-(button clicks)
-(crying stops)

-(baby crying)
-(door creaking)

Hey, hey.

Hey.

Hey. (shushing)

Hey.

-You okay?
-(crying stops)

There you go.

â™ª â™ª

(woman crying softly
in other room)

(crying continues)

â™ª â™ª

(sharp crunching)

(raspy moaning)

I run my mind.
It doesnâ€™t run me.

-(crunching, moaning)
-I run my mind.

It doesnâ€™t run me.

I run my mind.

It doesnâ€™t run me.

I run my mind.
It doesnâ€™t run me.


I run my mind.

It doesnâ€™t run me.

I run my mind.
It doesnâ€™t run me.


-BROOKS: Whoa.
-(beeping)

Oh, ah-ah.

Remember: "I run my mind.
It doesnâ€™t run me."

-"I run my mind..."
-I run my mind.

It doesnâ€™t run me.

I run my mind.
It doesnâ€™t run me.

I run my mind. It doesnâ€™t...


Do you know where you are?

Yeah. Sorry, sorry. I just...

It felt like
it was really choking me.

It tried to choke you?

Thatâ€™s psychogenic pain.

Itâ€™s-itâ€™s generated by the mind.

Th-Th-That thing
will go away, but...

you must be getting close
to something.

Your brain is throwing
everything at you.

What did you see?

Uh, well, um...

I saw Ava as a baby.

Saw my wife.

I donâ€™t...

Um...

Okay. Youâ€™re remembering.

This is natural.

Patients are often surprised
by what they remember.

I was in an apartment.

I donâ€™t know...
I donâ€™t know how I-I knew.

I-I-I just... I just knew
where everything was.

And as far as I know,
my house is the only place

my wife and I
ever lived together.

But remember, this device pulls
directly from your subconscious.

Maybe you were there
at some point in your life.

Maybe a-a shoot
for the newspaper?

No, no, no, it was too...
it was too familiar for that.

Did any faces appear this time?

Okay.


Itâ€™s okay, Nolan.

Youâ€™re getting close.
Stay with this.

Uh, Doctor? Got a...

Oh. (chuckles)

Wow. You were, uh...
you were just on my mind.

Whatâ€™s up?
Uh, I got about two minutes.

Whatâ€™s wrong?

Nol.

Yeah, did-did Rachel and I
ever fight?

Who doesnâ€™t? (chuckles)

-But never anything serious.
-Mm-hmm.

You had a tendency
to be late to things.

Did it ever escalate
to anything more?

What are you asking me?

Nol.

Did I ever... hit her?

Nol, you canâ€™t be serious.

Are you serious right now?

You hit one wall,
and all of a sudden

you think youâ€™re Bobby Brown?

Youâ€™re not.

Are you sure?

Yeah. Iâ€™m sure.

Bro, in college, I couldnâ€™t even
get you to watch boxing,

much less do it.

Okay? Youâ€™ve always been
a butterfly.

No offense,
but you were a pushover.

Kind of a punk, like...

I mean, you were
straight-up weak. (laughs)

I donâ€™t think
this is funny, Gary.

Okay. You... Hey, just...

Why donâ€™t you sit down,
all right?

Sit... Can we sit down
for a second?

Like, wh-what exactly happened?

Are you...
are you remembering something?

Okay, well, in the therapy, um,

we were in an apartment,
and Ava was a baby and...

Wait, an apartment?

-In your memory?
-Yeah. Yes.

Yes. Did... did we live
in an apartment?

Well, I-I was in Palo Alto
when Ava was born, so maybe,

but I donâ€™t think so.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Nol, what-what are you
thinking, man?

Um, okay.

Well, um, the place was
really familiar.

And Dr. Brooks said
the device shows memories

exactly the way they were.

Itâ€™s probably just
a hallucination.

R-Remember,

Nol, you had
a serious head injury.

Concussive trauma.

Thatâ€™s no joke, all right?

Plus, you got a lot
on your plate right now.

With Ava, with the job...

w-with remembering Rachel.

I mean, thing-things are just
getting mixed up in here.

Okay?

Trust me, Rachel would have
told me if something happened.

She was like a sister to me.

She wouldnâ€™t hide
something like that.

-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

Focus on Ava.

All right?


-All right?
-All right. All right.

Okay.

<i>(school bell ringing)</i>

â™ª â™ª

Dad.

Hey.

NOLAN:
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

AVA:
Smile and wave.

Just smile and wave.

NOLAN (softly):
Okay.

Letâ€™s try this.

One day.

Yep.

Arenâ€™t you too old for that?

But you always do this.

-All right.
-(seat belt clicks)

Okay. Good?

Did everything go well
with Dr. Brooks today?

Yeah. Great.

-(seat belt clicks)
-(sighs)

What happened?

I saw you as a baby.

How did I look?

You had no face.

Now, thatâ€™s creepy, Dad.

Hey, uh, you mind if we make
a quick stop?

Sure.

â™ª â™ª

Dad, do you have an address
or something?

Iâ€™m hungry.

Just-just one second.

Weâ€™re close.
I can sense it.

â™ª â™ª

(vehicle lock chirps, clicks)

Dad!

Daddy!

(lock chirps, clicks)

Hey, hey. Iâ€™m so sorry.

Iâ€™m sorry.
You-you want to come up?

-Yeah.
-Come on. Iâ€™m sorry.

Here. Come here.

Elevatorâ€™s down here.

â™ª â™ª

(bones cracking)

â™ª â™ª

Dad? Dad?

Whatâ€™s going on?

(door creaking)

Just wait here one second.

Just one second, okay?

â™ª â™ª

(lock clicks)

Yes?

Hey.

Hey, sorry...
sorry to bother you.

I didnâ€™t mean to bother you,
sweetie.

Um...

uh, I-I-I was...

I was hoping I could speak
to your mom really quick.

â™ª â™ª

(breath trembling)

I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

Sorry.

-Did we live here?
-Letâ€™s go. No.

-Mm. Letâ€™s go.
-(dog barking in distance)

-Really? (clears throat)
-Yes, yes, really.

Okay, okay, Iâ€™m doing it.

This is... I donâ€™t know why
Iâ€™m writing this address down.

-This is ridiculous. Take this.
-Come on.

-Please. Thank you.
-You...

Itâ€™s not what you think.
You would never hurt Rachel.

-Well, maybe I cheated.
-Okay, stop. You... Come here.

Look, you were a good husband,
a devoted one.

-You would never do that.
-Mm-hmm.

You would bend over backwards
for her, all right?

You wanted what you had.

Yeah, I donâ€™t think
I really did.

You did. You did, okay?

No matter how hard stuff got
for you at work,

no matter what
you were dealing with,

you made sure you made time
for both of them.

You would never
jeopardize that, okay?

Even... even now.

Hey, hey, listen to me.

Look at Ava.

Look at the way
she looks at you.

-Mm-hmm.
-It takes a good man

to keep a young girlâ€™s
spirits up

through everything
thatâ€™s happened.

That was you.

Not me, not her teachers.

-You, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

Nol, whatâ€™s it gonna take?

-Come on.
-Okay, yeah, you know,

I guess youâ€™re right.
I guess youâ€™re right.

Thank you so much. Um, Iâ€™m late
for my next appointment.

-Iâ€™ll talk to you later. Okay.
-Well, thatâ€™s all right.

-Uh, o-okay, well, knock it out.
-All right.

-And call me when youâ€™re done.
-Yeah, okay. See ya.

Iâ€™ll make time, okay?


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(door opens)

(Nolan sighs softly)

You look more relaxed today.

Yeah.

Letâ€™s aim to see a face.

Mm-hmm.

But if you see that thing,

-focus.
-(steady beeping)

-"I run my mind. It..."
-I run my mind.

It doesnâ€™t run me.
I got it, Doctor.

â™ª â™ª

PRIEST (distorted): Yes, there
will be challenges in life,

but the strength of your bond
will offer you protection

against lifeâ€™s storms.

Always make your relationship
a priority...

(sharp crunching)

(priest continues indistinctly)

(raspy moaning)

This ring is a sign
of the spiritual bond...

â™ª â™ª

(crunching, raspy moaning)

(panting softly)

(panting faster)

(bones clicking)

â™ª â™ª

(distorted whooshing)

(rapid beeping)

-(panting)
-(watch ticking)

Not today.



-(baby crying in other room)
-(fan rattling softly)

(hanger clatters on floor)

(baby crying)

(woman crying, whimpering)

(sharp crunching)

â™ª â™ª

(raspy moaning)

(distorted whooshing)



-Hey, uh, Dr. Reed.
-Hey.

Howâ€™s your friend? I saw that
heâ€™s in Dr. Brooksâ€™s study.

Yeah, yeah. Well, um,

listen, I-Iâ€™m trying to figure
something out about that night.

I donâ€™t understand
how he just suddenly woke up.

Yeah, he was lucky.

Yeah, thatâ€™s what all
the other doctors say, but...

do you remember
what exactly happened?


Excuse me.

WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Pierre, line 525.

-Dr. Pierre, line 525.
-(typing)

REED:
So, after I saw him,

Dr. Brooks was doing rounds
and got a second look on him.

Oh, Dr. Brooks saw him
that night?

Yeah. She was the only person
that didnâ€™t give up on him.

-I see.
-Yeah, she took him to her lab,

and when he came out,
he was conscious again.

Wait, she took him to her lab?

Yeah.

He was lucky she was there.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, I need to see Dr. Brooks.

Oh, sheâ€™s still with Mr. Wright.

How much longer? Theyâ€™ve been
in there for a while.

Theyâ€™re in a session.

In my experience, the longer
the session, the better.

All right, well,
tell her to call me.

-Okay.
-Thanks.

(watch ticking)



(trembling breaths)

(heartbeat pulsing)

â™ª â™ª

(distorted whooshing)

(alarm beeping)

BROOKS:
Hey.

Where are you?

Whatâ€™s happening?

(alarm continues beeping)

(rapid beeping)

(watch clicks)

(watch ticking)

â™ª â™ª


-(baby crying)
-(soft whimpering)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


(watch ticking)

MAN:
These arenâ€™t Nolanâ€™s memories.

Theyâ€™re mine.

Theyâ€™ve always been mine.

â™ª â™ª

(breath trembling)

-Hey.
-(grunts softly)

-(baby fussing)
-(laughs)


â™ª â™ª

Iâ€™m full. (chuckles)

Mom?

(steady beeping)

Thomas?

But how?

How?

You remember?

-Mom?
-Thank God you remember.

You remember.


(breathing shakily)

â™ª â™ª

(grunts softly)

-Hmm?
-Mom, what did you do?

-Itâ€™s okay.
-No.

Youâ€™re all right.

Okay, Mom... what did you do?

-Sit down.
-Mom, what did you do?

Thomas.

Thomas, please.

Please, come, come.

And sit.

Oh, Thomas.

When you slipped down those
stairs, they brought you here.

You were still alive,
but it was already too late.

They tried everything.

And in the process,
they used an EEG.

I found out and downloaded
your data from the servers

and waited to find
the right patient

to upload
your consciousness into.

I had already gotten
to the point

where I could emulate it
in the lab,

and-and I hoped
that I could do it for real.

Wait. So, wait.

Th-Thatâ€™s that project
you were talking about.

Wait. Wait, wait, how...
how long...

how long... how long
have I been gone?

Two years.

â™ª â™ª

Okay. Okay, okay.

Um...

Okay, so why this man?

Why Nolan?

Oh, that was fate.

Uh, a few months ago,

he came here brain-dead
from that car accident.

Uh, it was
a perfect opportunity.

He was the right man.

I didnâ€™t know
if it had even worked

until I took the Black Box off
and you grabbed my hand

and I knew you were in there.

You just couldnâ€™t
fully remember.

And I couldnâ€™t force it, because
the brain was still adjusting.

But I hoped that you would
remember fully one day,

but you never did.

So I thought
I had to get you back here

and the Black Box would help you
tie up the loose ends.

So-so-so I-Iâ€™m not an amnesiac?

Hmm-mm.

Your brain was just adjusting.

Mom.

Mom, what...

What do you expect...

What do you expect me to do?

Just go out there
and pretend to be him?


No.

â™ª â™ª

(chuckles softly)

Ashley.

You have a second shot, son.

You have a second shot
to make it right.

Not just with Ashley
but with your wife.

You have a second chance
to be the father

and the man
I know you should be.

(takes deep breath)

What about Ava?

Sheâ€™s not your daughter.

(door closes)

â™ª â™ª

(school bell ringing)

Letâ€™s go, guys. Line up.
No pinching.

(chatter continues)

AVA:
Uh, is everything okay?

Yeah.

Why?

You seem sad.

Iâ€™m not.

Great, so no biggie.

Yeah.

â™ª â™ª

Hey. Me.

Hey.

(seat belt clicks)

What are you doing?

Dinner, Dad.

Did you smoke?

Dad, I thought I told you,
you donâ€™t smoke.

(Ava sighs)

How about stir-fry?

You love that.

Good.

That means we can stop
at the store.

The recipe says we need
something called bean sprouts.

NOLAN:
Uh, actually, letâ€™s not.

What?

Yeah, I need to talk to you
about something.

Uh, itâ€™s probably best
if we just get home.

What?

Is everything okay?

I need to drop you off at Garyâ€™s
for a few days.

Wait, what? Why?

Because things
arenâ€™t safe with me.

Please, Dad, youâ€™re fine.

How are you going to cook?

What if you wake up late?

Canâ€™t Dr. Brooks just
give you medicine? Dad.

Hey, Dad. Come on, Dad.

Weâ€™ve been through it all
these few months,

-and now you want
to do this now? -Stop it!

â™ª â™ª

Goddamn it, stop it!

Iâ€™m a grown man, okay?

Just...

(tapping steering wheel)

Just trust me, all right?

(engine starts)

Daddy, I thought you said it was
only gonna be a couple of days.

No, letâ€™s hurry up.
Itâ€™s getting late.

â™ª â™ª

-(Ava grunts)
-(bag zipping)

Here, I got it. I got it.

Okay. See you soon.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

GARY:
Need any help?

AVA:
I got it.

GARY:
Okay.

All right, one second,
all right?

-Nol.
-What?

I found out that Dr. Brooks
took you into her lab

when you were in a coma.

Okay.

Okay. That doesnâ€™t
seem strange to you?

Well, I-I donâ€™t know
whatâ€™s going on,

but it could have something
to do with these false memories

youâ€™ve been seeing.

Hey, hey, youâ€™re looking
a little rough.

You want to come inside?

I mean, Iâ€™m worried about you
going home alone.

Why donâ€™t you just
stay here with us?

I appreciate it, but I told you,

I-I just need
some time alone, so...

I just need to be
in my own space,

-in my own environment.
-In your environ...

-(softly): Yeah.
-Without Ava?

You-Youâ€™re not making any sense.

L-Letâ€™s talk this out, man.

Itâ€™s just a few days.

I just need some time.

Please.

Okay.

(engine starts)

â™ª â™ª

Okay.

Look, if you come back,
Iâ€™m gonna have to call the cops.

Wait, wait, wait. M-Miranda.

Miranda?

H-How do you know my name?

Uh...

How?

Well, I... Sorry.
I-Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m sorry.

I went to, uh... I went to...

I went to undergrad
with your husband.

Um, we were, uh... we were, um,
bio majors together.

But I never met you.

Uh, yeah, we-we-we, um...

I donâ€™t know.

Uh, we-we-we-we took that,
uh, genetics class,

and, um, I guess, after that,

we didnâ€™t have the same track
and... and grew apart.

But-but he, um...

he told me about
the first day he met you.

He, uh...

He told me, um,
he was lucky to have you.

And how patient
you were with him.

And I-I-I know...
I know how hard it was for him

to get into
a decent medical school.

But, uh...

he said, if it wasnâ€™t for you,

he wouldnâ€™t have been able
to stick with it.


Um...

So, uh... whatâ€™s up?

Oh, well, you know,
Iâ€™m just, uh...

I-I just moved in the area,

and I just wanted
to introduce myself.

Oh. Okay.

Um, whatâ€™s your name?

ASHLEY:
Is dinner ready?

Almost. Um... hold on.

Did you finish your homework?

But, Mom...

Hey. No pouting.

-Come on.
-ASHLEY: I really donâ€™t want to.

MIRANDA: I know you donâ€™t
want to, but no pouting.

ASHLEY:
Yeah, but... yeah, but eating...

but eating is more important
than homework.

-MIRANDA: Really?
-I think I should eat first.

-(laughing): Are you finished?
-No.

Go and finish, all right?

-Okay.
-Good girl. Come on.

Uh, I am sorry. I, uh...

It was good to meet you,
but I have to finish dinner

-and take care of my daughter,
so... -Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, um, Iâ€™m sorry. Um...

Do you... do you have a moment?

Uh, I actually donâ€™t.

Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m so sorry. Itâ€™ll...
itâ€™ll only take one minute.

Please.

Uh, yeah.

Just have a seat.

Um, I need to turn this down.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

So, um...

whatâ€™s going on?

Um...

Do you remember my m...
um, his mom, Dr. Brooks?

Of course, um...

but to be honest, we donâ€™t talk.

Did-did something happen
to her or...?

No. No. No.

Okay, uh, do you...

Do you remember that, uh...

that dream project
she was always talking about?

-Uh, the one where...
-(both chuckle)

where she thought
she could use brain waves

to save and restore
someoneâ€™s consciousness?

Yeah. (laughs)

Yeah, the digital voodoo
nonsense.

It wasnâ€™t voodoo.

Okay, um...

what about it?

Okay, um...

Okay, yeah, uh, it...

Uh, I, uh...
this is really hard to explain.

Um... all right,
I donâ€™t really get it, either,

but...



...but it... but it worked.
She did it.

Mm, did what?

Um, what was your name, anyway?

Thomas.

Like him?


Miranda...

Iâ€™m Thomas.

Iâ€™m gonna need you to leave now.

Iâ€™m gonna need you to leave.

-No, wait. Miranda.
-I-Iâ€™m...

-Miranda. Miranda, wait.
-You have five seconds,

-or Iâ€™m gonna call the cops.
-Uh, okay.

Um... (panting)

This wallpaper.

This wallpaper,
you-you used to...

you used to hate it,
but I wanted to keep it up

to remind us that this wasnâ€™t
the final destination.

On our first date,
our first date,

it was 95 degrees,
and you wore a sweater outside

because it was the only piece of
clean laundry that you had left.

Whenever you were nervous...

I would take your hand

and write on the back of it
with my fingers, "Okay."

She actually pulled it off.

(breath trembles)

So... whoâ€™s this?

Oh, he, uh... heâ€™s gone.
Heâ€™s gone.

Heâ€™s brain-dead. I...

She said it was like
a transplant.

I-I donâ€™t understand.

Gone where? How? What...

I donâ€™t fully understand it,
either, but...

itâ€™s real.

Iâ€™m real.

It-itâ€™s crazy, but itâ€™s real.

So...

so, what do you do?

Like, take his place?

Maybe, but I...

I...

I thought this could be a chance

for us to rewrite us.

A chance for me
to make things right again.

No, Iâ€™m...

Iâ€™m not gonna hurt you anymore.

I just want to try again.

I just want to try again
with you.

Uh...

Whereâ€™s my Orlando picture?

I...

Where are the, uh...

Where are the pictures of me?

My chair? My bookshelf?

Um...

I know I made some mistakes,
but you erased me?

I think you should go.

Mm-hmm.

â™ª â™ª

Okay.

Um, I died out there.

Do you understand that?

I died.

And now Iâ€™m here.

I died...

and now Iâ€™m here.

Does that mean nothing to you?

Oh, yeah, of course.
It doesnâ€™t.

Itâ€™s always my fault.

Look, I canâ€™t do this right now.

Oh, you...
you canâ€™t do this right now?

What would be a better day
for you, huh?

(furniture creaks nearby)

No, stop.

(grunting, whimpering)

Donâ€™t you ever touch me again.

No.

Please.

Sheâ€™s my daughter, too.

No, stop.

No. No.

(door creaking)

(Miranda grunts)

(high-pitched ringing)

GARY:
<i>Whereâ€™d you go? Ava!</i>


GARY:
Hey, what happened?

-Whatâ€™s going on, Nol?
-(groans)

Youâ€™re bleeding.
What happened to your head, man?

Hey. Nol!

Hey, stop!

You... youâ€™re scaring us.

-Nol!
-(gasps)

(sharp crunching)

GARY:
Just donâ€™t lea...

-Nol! Wait!
-(tires squealing)

Let me help you!


Mom, talk to me.

Talk to me, Mom!

Why... Wh-What...

whatâ€™s wrong with me?

Why did I end up
in front of Ava? Please.

You need to calm down.
Iâ€™m thinking.

Are you sure you saw that thing
in the reflection?

-Yes.
-(sighs)

Itâ€™s your mind.

Itâ€™s doing what it did
inside the Black Box.

Itâ€™s trying to protect you.

It took you to the last place
where you felt safe.

Okay, thatâ€™s inside the Box,
but...

how did it get control out here?

Tell me exactly what happened.

Where are Miranda and Ashley?

They locked me out.

Why would they...

Already?

Hey, I didnâ€™t...

I didnâ€™t do anything, okay?

They made up their minds.
They donâ€™t want me anymore!

Itâ€™s...

You listen to me.

No, it starts here.

Right here.

This is so, so powerful.

More than you can imagine.

And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s taking over.

Because youâ€™re allowing it.

Thomas, take control
of your life for once

and become the doctor
you are meant to be.

The father
youâ€™re supposed to be.

The man that people expect
my son to be.

Or do you want to be
like your father?

Forgotten.

Erased.

Sit down.

-(line rings, beeps)
-ASSISTANT: Youâ€™ve reached

the office of
Dr. Lillian Brooks.

We currently arenâ€™t in
right now...

(line beeps)


(groans quietly, sniffs)

Uh, hey, Ava.

Can... can I borrow that
for a second?

Sure.

Thank you.

Donâ€™t worry.
Everythingâ€™s gonna be all right.

-Okay?
-Okay.

-3030 Green Road.
-AVA: Hey.

Thatâ€™s where
me and my dad went to.

Really?

Yeah.

â™ª â™ª

"Stairwell fall."

"Brooks."

Youâ€™re sure, if I get rid
of that thing, Iâ€™ll be good?

You think of that thing as
the root of a virus and kill it,

itâ€™ll stop these
traumatic responses

that are happening
in your body out here.

But I donâ€™t know whatâ€™ll happen
if it harms you.

How do I find it?

Itâ€™ll find you.

(steady beeping)

â™ª â™ª

Choose your own safe room
this time.

Got it.

THOMAS:
Mom.

M-Mom, itâ€™s-itâ€™s Nolan.

Itâ€™s your mind

doing what it has to do
to hold you back.

Remember why youâ€™re there.

No. Please.

Please.



Please. Please.

-Please.
-(slaps hand)


Get ready to detach me, Mom.

Good.

Ten, nine,

-AVA: Daddy!

-GARY: Donâ€™t...
-AVA: What are you doing?

-BROOKS: No. What?
Hey, hey, hey. -Let him go.

-GARY: W-Wait. W-W-Wait.
-BROOKS: Get... No, no, no!

No, no. Donâ€™t touch him!

-Hey, what? Wh-Wh-What?
-Donâ€™t touch anything.

-Heâ€™s still under.
-Daddy, do you hear me?!

Dad, Iâ€™m here!

Daddy, do you hear me?!



Iâ€™m here.

GARY: Let her work. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

Sit. Sit.

We donâ€™t want to hurt him, okay?

Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m gonna restart the count.

You ready?

Mom, itâ€™s really him.

Stop it and focus.

Itâ€™s not.

But it is.
He is still alive.

Why do I even try?

No matter what I do,
no matter what I sacrifice,

youâ€™re still not ready.

Never ready.

Get ready to count me out.

BROOKS:
Ten, nine,

eight, seven...

ASHLEY:
<i>Daddy, stop!</i>

-THOMAS: <i>Stop it, okay?!</i>
-MIRANDA: <i>No! No!</i>

You see what you made me do?!
You see what you made me do?!


-(kick thumps)

Donâ€™t you touch her!

What is going on?

Son, respond.

-Is everything okay?
-Daddy, come on!

-Weâ€™re here! Daddy!
-No. No, no, no.

-Wait, wait, wait.
-Son, respond.

Is everything okay?

-GARY: Just hold on.
-AVA: Dad!

GARY:
Ava, please, just wait.

Iâ€™m gonna count you out.

-Come on. Come on, Iâ€™m here!
-GARY: Nolan.

Ten, nine,

eight,

-seven...
-Nolan, can you hear me? -Daddy!

...six, five...

-Whatâ€™d you do to him?
-...four, three...

-He should be going to the ICU.
Dr. Brooks! -...two, one. One.

(flatline tone)

-(crying): Daddy.
-Wait. Ava, wait.

AVA:
Come on.

-(panting)
-(steady beeping)

Daddy?

-Daddy?
-GARY: Hold on.

GARY:
Nol?

(Brooks chuckles)

Thomas.

(grunts softly)
Daddy.

Please.

Let go.

â™ª â™ª

(both mimic explosion)

GARY:
Nol.

Hey, you good?

â™ª â™ª

No. Something is wrong.

We have to do this again.

-Hold on.
-Stop. Stop.

-Stop!
-No, you... Get off!

You took an oath.

(Nolan grunts)

Come on. (grunts)

GARY: Hey, Nol.
Hey, let me help you.

Letâ€™s get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.

Come on. (grunts)

Come on. Here we go.

(Gary grunts, pants)


-Wait! No!
-Stop.

Youâ€™re done.

(door opens, closes)

â™ª â™ª

(crickets chirping outside)

â™ª â™ª


Hey, hey, hey, hey.

-Hey. Dad.
-Hey.

Howâ€™s it going?

Oh, my God, look at your hair.

-(both chuckle)
-(sniffles)

Mm.

(Nolan sniffles)

How about you get a book
and Iâ€™ll read it to you?

-Sure.
-Yeah?

â™ª â™ª

ASHLEY:
What are you reading?

Oh, uh...

nothing.

Come on.

Should we get the rest
of the books?

-Yeah.
-(chuckles)
