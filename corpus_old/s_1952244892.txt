THE LITTLE TRAITOR

<i>From 1917 to 1948,
Palestine was ruled... </i>

<i>by orders of the British Mandate. </i>

<i>After the Second World War,
the British tried to reduce... </i>

<i>the number of refugees from
post- Holocaust in Palestine. </i>

<i>As a result,
the National Military Organization... </i>

<i>and the Haganah used
armed resistance. </i>

<i>To halt the violence,
the British ordered... </i>

<i>a nightly curfew for
the Arab and Jewish communities. </i>

JERUSALEM, 1947

<i>Curfew.
Curfew. </i>

<i>Curfew.
Attention. </i>

<i>Everyone should be home
after 18h. </i>

<i>Curfew. </i>

<i>Who is found
after 17h, will be arrested. </i>

<i>Everyone should be home
after 18h. </i>

<i>- Stop!
Attention-.</i>

Stop!
Here!

<i>Who is found
after 17h, will be arrested. </i>

<i>- Freeze!
Curfew. </i>

You come with me!
Easy.

<i>Attention. </i>

Can not get that close
the curfew, Proffy.

Could have been arrested.

Sorry, Papa.
We have many concerns.

I'm no longer holding me back.
You're right.

It will not be late again.

Proffy, we were worried.
Glad you came.

Go to your room
and stay there until dinner.

<i>Our strength moves
against the British defenses. </i>

<i>Their commander ordered
prepare to fight</i>

<i>soldiers, preparing to shoot</i>

<i>Fire. Stop them.
Stop the poppy pathetic. </i>

Kill the British.

Dear listeners,
here is the Voice of Jerusalem...

with important news.

In the middle of the night, Palestine
initiated the attack...

and expelled all British of Israel.

Proffy, what are you doing?
Nothing, Ima. Just reading my book.

What book?
From school.

Come, dinner is on the table.
Coming.

<i>Dear listeners... </i>

<i>here is the Voice of Jerusalem
with important news. </i>

<i>Five men were arrested
stealing weapons and ammunition. </i>

<i>They are suspected of belonging
an illegal organization. </i>

<i>In special meeting UN... </i>

<i>what happened yesterday,
a committee was set up... </i>

<i>will receive the name UNSCOP... </i>

<i>Special Committee of the UN
to Palestine. </i>

Would not have a state
without the help of the world.

Why all hate the Jews?
We know a lot.

So we should perhaps not
know much.

The reasons for the hate may change,
but they will hate us forever.

What should we do?
Must be different.

And do not hate.

But as not hate the British?

Are terrible.
We know people worse.

Well, I do not know.

I do not know anyone
worse than the British.

The important thing is resisted.
Weakness is sin.

And also wasteful.
Eat your dinner.

I wish I could...
Do not talk with mouth full.

I have to age
into the movement.

Not think about it.

Who is our home
in the middle of the night?

Nobody.

Nobody? I hear things.

People talking
and dragging the furniture.

I said. Nobody.

I can leave?

Please take a few things
Mr Lazarus on the roof.

Ludmilla, you were
good chicken today.

Put three eggs for me.

You make all the time noise, Olga,

and gave no eggs.

No, not this time.

But I do it the next time...

If you have not learned the lesson.

Thank you.

No, no 'thank you'.

Meet the Oriental Palace?

I...

I'm almost there
every afternoon.

No coffee.

Come on, boy.

Sorry, I...
I feel.

See what happened in Haifa?

A boy of his age
left in retreat...

and the British beat him.

Parents found him
in a Arabic hospital.

Will not leave the room
until the end of the week.

Just go to the bathroom.
What?

Dining alone...

and take a long time to
think about what happened...

and what could have happened.

And will be no allowance
until September.

Now go to your room.

<i>BoKer Tov. </i>

Do not step on my army.

How many days remaining?

Three more days?
I will die in this room.

How is the world outside?

How to listen

E- see flowers, trees, hills?
You see it soon.

Got a breakfast

I thought we had left
to be free of Eretz.

I am not free!
Must follow the rules...

Who's here?

What is that noise?

What's going on here?

This is my house too.

Proffy.

It is very important
to be quiet now.

Be quiet.

I wish you'd take me in the prison.

It's time.
Finally.

<i>Let me out, Dady. <i/>

Finally out of the cage.
Want to eat?

I do not want to eat, Ima.
I just want to go outside.

I hope I have not
more problems, Proffy...

and has learned the lesson.

Learned, for sure.

Can I quit now?
Go.

<i>A full week

<i>seemed a year. </i>

<i>As his father was
do that to you?</i>

<i>None of my parents
dare I do this. </i>

<i>This is not surprising... </i>

<i>are locked in a room
with his mother all the time. </i>

<i>I would have fled. </i>

<i>I, if I could. </i>

<i>I have something important
to talk. </i>

<i>More importantly
that Operation Nails?</i>

<i>Maybe. </i>

<i>I discovered a vital source
intelligence. </i>

<i>I ask permission to
followed with espionage. </i>

<i>We need more details. </i>

<i>Can not yet disclose.
This jeopardize the mission. </i>

<i>Do not forget that I,
as commander in chief... </i>

<i>must always be informed. </i>

<i>I pass the information, if any. </i>

<i>Hello, Proffy, how are you</i>

<i>- I run.
Where you been all this time?</i>

<i>Busy-.
Let's talk. </i>

<i>- We of his company. Today
I... </i>

<i>I am in a hurry. </i>

Hey, man. You got a light?

I told him,
I will not do that.

I do not blame.
Of course not.

Sergeant Dunlop of Canterbury?

It's Proffy.
Of course.

What took so to visit me?

I was stuck at home.

How is malaria of your dad?
Better.

Good.

Why not sit down, boy?

You are reading our
Book of Samuel?

Yes, I am.

You like to study Hebrew?
Not really.

I'm trying to learn.

It makes sense to stay
so much time here...

without learning the local language.

You study Samuel?
I have to study in school.

And?
I prefer comic books.

Undoubtedly.

I have a question for you.

In Samuel II...
Why so much like to read Samuel?

It is so boring.
Boring?

Boy, this is the beginning
of the monarchy.

If you understand the words,
will understand the concepts.

For example, see:
Chapter 3, verse 1.

"Extend to a long...

the war between the house
of Saul and of David.

But as the power
David went up from fortified...

the house of Saul would be
increasingly weakening. "

Yeah, so?

What is the word
to 'undermine'?

This, <i>daleem. </i>
<i>Daleem</i>, it.

According to my trusty dictionary,
<i>daleem</i> can be...

Poor.
Exactly.

So being poor
means also to be weak?

Yes, according to their language.

I don't like it.

We are a bit poor,
but we are not weak.

Yes, I can see that.

You are Israeli?
Yes.

Actually, my mother said
I am shocked in Poland...

but I just left the egg here.

She loves to
references chickens.

Really?
Then you are Polish?

No, just my parents.

You British- born?
Sure.

Well, I loved the visit,
but gotta go now.

I have a report to do.
Really? What kind of report?

It is a secret business.

You come visit me again?

I do not know.

Maybe not.

When can I come?
Tomorrow, at the same time.

I'll visit tomorrow.

Good day, Proffy.

Good day.

<i>Have problems
with the British?</i>

<i>Not, they come from Europe. </i>

<i>The boat will get at
4 in the morning. </i>

<i>We find them and hide them here. </i>

Got blankets and pillows.
Thanks.

<i>I am not very confident. </i>

We plan this for days.
Just going to sleep a few hours.

Sleep thinking about it...

no one else will kill
or humiliate the Jews.

Come on, boy. It's your turn.

Put your hand here.
Open your fingers.

And hold on it.

A little down. So.

Keep strong.

You can go.

Very good!

Who is that?
A friend.

Do not have bombs hidden?

Hardly.

Come on.

You see a green ball?
Try to hit it.

Just. Nice try.

I am not very good
in that game.

What do you call it?
Snooker.

'Snooker', word crazy.

And that one that said,
indudi...

Undoubtedly.
Exactly.

Words are really stupid.

"Parva?"
Crazy.

<i>- Mishugah.
Mishugah?</i>

Parva.

Yes, the snooker is undoubtedly
parva and <i>mishugah. </i>

You are good at that?
I'm good in school.

I am good at thinking.
In riddles.

At war strategies.
Strategy of war?

So, wants to be a soldier?
I would rather be the general.

Everything has to be
a general one day.

Someone in your family do it?
Nobody.

My only family are my mom and dad.

The Nazis killed everyone.

Sorry.

My father does not talk about it,
but my mother told me everything.

I had grandparents, uncles and aunts.

My father had
a younger brother...

He tried to escape with us,
but he was caught and killed.

I sometimes think my father
likes to be sad...

to compensate
the death of his brother.

Do you have big family?

Not realy.

I have a sister in Manchester.
My mother is in Canterbury.

And some cousins
in Southampton.

Listen...

or help me with some questions
about the Book of Samuel II?

Sure.
<i>Lamah lo. </i>

<i>Sure?</i>

What do you think?
It's a lot of funny.

No, my bishop!

Okay. Come.

Thanks, but I'm on duty.

Of course not.

and were killed.

Since then

looking for weapons...

Why are you here?
Why do you occupy our country?

Why not go away?

You could be occupied by country
worse than mine.

Why do not you leave

Come here.
What is his problem?

What abused. Jewish.

Do you think I myself

But could not

What does she look like?

She reminds me

You know?

No, but I know

She does not seem

How does she look like?

Well..

she has dark hair,
brown eyes...

She is great? Lean? Fat?

She is small and very trimp.

You have a girlfriend?
Not exactly.

And you have one?

I think so.

It is like visiting a country
which never was.

Interested in 'travel', then?

Yes, I remember.
Was 11 years...

I am interested in 'travel'.

She looks to you?
No, it is in my neighborhood.

She knows you like her?
No.

But you will tell her?
No.

Why?
Because...

My boy, this is very good.

You will do well,

Tell that to her,

And she has very big <i>shadayim. </i>

<i>Shadayim?</i> hands?

No, hand. It's <i>yadayim. </i>

<i>The idea was his.
Ten minutes before the touch. </i>

<i>- Spoke with him yesterday?
Yes... </i>

<i>He said find us here. </i>

Oh my God!

Oh, my God,
Today is Tuesday!

What?
Do not go on this road!

Why?

Take the other road
to the city.

What are you talking about?

A truck turned old.
Has nails everywhere.

I saw this morning.
Your tires are 'found'.

No, it is boring.

Whatever!
Take the other road.

Okay.

<i>It is almost the curfew. </i>

<i>What donkey. </i>

<i>Certainly. Immediate action. </i>

You can stop here.

God was looking after you.

Here, take off the shoes.

I spread your toys.

Pretend that you are here

Where were you?
With my friends.

They were here looking for you.

The liar's life

<i>- Mitziah.
Mitziah. </i> Come on.

I talked with my girlfriend
Priscilla yesterday.

Spoke?
I spoke, yes.

And your girlfriend?
Nothing new.

Anyway...

I spoke with Priscilla
by phone.

It was the first time
we talk about 6 months.

They were just letters
and postcards.

Your turn.

What did you talk about?
May I ask?

Same things as men
and women speak.

What kind of things?
I like to know.

I was thinking of
when I leave.

I go home...

and man
to ask you in marriage.

I myself long ago.

Do you know when?

When I asked her
in marriage?

When you gone leave.

No really.

But they will be quite soon.

Take a soda?
Okay.

So yours.

A beer for me
and a soda for lad.

I already have.

Therefore, when you
think will leave?

I thought that we wanted far.

I do.
The sooner the better.

Also wanted it was soon, my lad.

Will not be a road
easy to follow.

The road of the past was not.

That is true.

Here it is.

Want to hear my prediction?

<i>Lamah lo. </i> Okey.

I think at the end
the British Mandate...

there will be a Jewish state.
This is what we want.

And there will be troubles,
this time between Arabs and Jews.

Troubles?
What kind of troubles?

The Arabs are the weakest.
It will be like the Jews.

Is in the Bible.
The prophets predicted.

Want to hear my prediction?

<i>Lamah lo. </i>

Everything will be better
when all of you leave.

Except of you.

I need to go home.

I almost forgot.

I brought this book to you...

and the Book of Samuel.

It is from a fifth grade class.
Yes, it is at this level I am.

I will return them soon.
No, its yours to keep.

Thank you very much.

It is a wonderful gift.

I see you soon.

PROFFY LEIBOWITZ IS A TRAITOR

Mr. Leibowitz, quit, please.

Please, we want talk to you.

Get out, please.
Mr. Leibowitz!

Quit!

What is it?

We are here
to talk about your son.

What is the problem?

Proffy Leibowitz is a traitor.
He betrayed the Jewish people!

Looks like you been Proffy
pass the secrets to the British.

What are you talking about?

Almost every day, he will
goes to the Oriental Palace...

talk a British soldier.

It is one o'clock there
and then comes home.

We followed you, many times.

Is this true?
Is not what it seems.

Your child should be interrogated.

I am his father,
I'll take care of it.

<i>You should have spoken
before with me. </i>

So, no, children.
Stop it.

Stop!

This is unbelievable.

<i>Your child put us in danger?</i>

No, I don't think so.

But it'd better if you sleep somewhere else.

She is right.
The house is probably been watched.

I warn the others.

We will not sleep here, for now.

We are very sorry.

Is anybody there?
No.

It seems to be quite.

Certainly the home monitor.

Maybe we shouldn't
get involved more with them.

We must do our part.

But we are at risks and Proffy too.

We are not planning anything...

only offer the house
for them to sleep.

Is he unhappy boy?

I do not know.

If you did
more attention to him...

I understand that this is my fault.
I never said that.

You said if I playing more...
I am not talking about play...

I'm talking about listening to him.
Okay, if I had heard more...

he would not be fascinated
by a British soldier.

This is what you saying?

No.

What, boy?
They followed me.

Discovered that I visit you.

Who?
Ben Hur and Chita.

And my friends
don't talk to me anymore.

And my parents are ashamed of me.

They call me a traitor
and I'm going to be interrogated.

I go to talk to them.
No, it will not make things better.

But I want to help you.
I can handle it myself.

If I talk to your
friends and family...

But it will be good for you.

For your situation with your army.

Proffy, you really are...

I wish Priscilla meet you.

And your mother in Manchester.
Yes.

Maybe one day.
Maybe.

Maybe one day there will be
Mandate a Jew in Britain.

I think I will not able to... for a while.

Of course.

You better stay away.
That will be best.

<i>Shalom</i>, Sergeant Dunlop.

<i>The price today is very good. </i>

<i>Here is. </i>

Come to our attention...

that you have a
relationship with a...

Sergeant Stephen Dunlop.

You visited him in Oriental Palace...

at least 12 times.
Is that correct?

Yes.

What is the nature of your
relationship with this man?

We are friends.
Friends?

I see.

You have friends your own age?
I used to.

How did you meet this Sergeant Dunlop?

I was out after curfew...

and he got me.
And was going to arrest me.

And did he arrested you?
No.

Why was that?

Maybe he find I was too young.

They arrested many boys of your age.

Some of them were beaten.

Do you offer something...

or said something that made
he decides not arrest you?

I told him, I wasn't afraid
if he arrested me.

And how did he respond?

He said he let me go this time,

but the next time
if I be out of the curfew,

he have to arrest me.

So, why did you start to visit him?

It was very interesting
to talk with him.

What would you talk about?
I do not know. Things.

Girls.

He likes to talk about Hebrew language.

And the Bible.
His father was a minister.

He asked if you knew
any underground activities?

No.

He asked if you knew anybody
in the underground?

Never.

Did you had any political
discussions with him?

You mean like Ben Gurion or something?

Yes.
I do not remember.

Look, he knows
that I hate the British.

I hate the occupation.

So you did had a
political discussion with him?

Yes, but no.

Sergeant Dunlop asked
the name of your friends?

No.
Do not want to know about your friends?

He wanted to know about
my friends and my family...

never asked their names.

If you're hiding
any information from us...

you can be put in the prison,
regardless of your age.

All right.
After the transcript...

we will decide if and when
any punishment...

of Proffy Leibowitz and his family.

You will be under watch by next month...

and will be forbiden from having any
contact with this British soldier.

Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

That closed our session.

<i>You is a terrible traitor. </i>

<i>The worst traitor is that
that approaches the enemy. </i>

I do believe that you were telling the truth.

But after what I have seen...

I trust no human being.

On <i>Montag</i>, you have friends...

on <i>Freitag</i>, they become our enemies.

The only one you can trust are the chickens.

Frank!

Hi old man.
You are going home!

Are now almost 4 years.

I am counting the minutes
out of this hell.

I think you will miss it.

I want to be in a country
where they are pleased to see me.

Listen, you know that kid
coming visit me?

Coming over time?

Say that I sent home
and not to talk to him...

before leaving.

Tell him I wish a brilliant life.

You can do this?
Of course, Stephen.

Sure.

See you in Thistle Square.
Bye.

Stay away from Proffy.

Do not worry.

You will have fun at school
I promise.

So stay calm.

Do not worry
and be well, right?

It will be okay.

Stay away from Proffy, understand?
Do not approach him.

You will love it, I promise.

<i>Good morning, students... </i>

<i>welcome the new school year. </i>

<i>Good morning, teacher Gihon. </i>

<i>We have a new student this year... </i>

<i>Rachel Hochberg,
she does not speak Hebrew. </i>

We have a new student,
Rachel Hochberg...

which came to us from Cyprus.
<i>Bruchim Habaaim. </i>

<i>Hope you have
enjoyed the holidays. </i>

<i>We all know the evil
occurred in the last week... </i>

<i>Quiet, quiet. </i>

<i>Freeze. </i>

<i>Silence be quiet. </i>

<i>Freeze. Freeze. </i>

<i>- You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?
No, sorry. </i>

You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?
No.

You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?

No, not seen.
Me neither.

You know where the
Sergeant Dunlop is?

I do not know.

They took him to the barricades.

Pass me the ashtray, please.

Thank you.

<i>Division 23, 6h training. </i>

You do not have permission.
I want to see the Sergeant Dunlop.

I do not know who he is...

and you are not allowed
to enter, understand?

I just want to say goodbye before
he return to England.

Listen, boy,
I am not speaking in code...

you can not enter.

Where the soldiers going?

Are going to Haifa, go back home.

Sergeant Dunlop!
Sergeant Dunlop!

Sergeant Dunlop!
Sergeant Dunlop!

Sergeant Dunlop!

Proffy? Is everything all right?
<i>- I am tired, Ima. </i>

Come, I make you some pudding.
<i>- I do not want pudding. </i>

We have made decision
about your son.

Thank you.

At school asked to stay vigilant
and ask them the same.

We must always know where he is.

Yes, of course.

The boy must not be envolved
in any controversy...

Nothing.

Whatever individual politics may be.

The boy is just a boy.

<i>Chita, wait... </i>

<i>will never talk to me?</i>

<i>Hey, sorry for not
told them the truth. </i>

<i>I was scared. </i>

<i>You want a Gibi borrow?</i>

<i>You can even get one or two. </i>

<i>And homework?
I can help you. </i>

We have good news
for you, Proffy.

Yes?
They are not pressing any charges against you.

I never did anything wrong.

Well, that's what they decided.

I wish other people think so.

I think, it's better in school?

Nothing is better anymore.

I hate the school.

Do you like I have the conversation
with Mr. Gihon?

My God, no.
It make things worse.

Besides, he hates me
as much as the rest.

They do not hate you, Proffy.

They are making the scapegoat.

Sometimes, children need
someone to criticize.

They hate me
because of Sergeant Dunlop.

But my enemy was much more
friend to me that my friends.

Do you think it will be possible...

What?

I know you will think I am crazy.

Do you think there is any chance...

that we go back to Poland?

We fought so hard to get here.

Why you want to go to Poland?

I ruined this country.

Do not be silly,
you only 11 years old.

In Poland, I could make a fresh start.

In school call me the 'traitor'
and they hates me.

Maybe there I have the chance
to be known as fine man...

instead of here.

A 'traitor' for the rest of my life.

Proffy...

no way hell to go to Poland.

Eat.

<i>So Proffy... </i>

<i>that there is
sitting here so long?</i>

<i>What problem? I like. </i>

<i>And the friends with whom
runs the city?</i>

<i>do not know who are my friends. </i>

<i>What is a friend, anyway?</i>

<i>Listen this... </i>

<i>'Tell me who you walk with,
and tell you who you are. '</i>

<i>But that boy. </i>

I told him?
Not yet.

Proffy, your mother and I
we will travel for a few days.

Why?

There will be a honor service of people...

who died in our town in Poland.

We must go to that.
And we also need to get away.

But what about me?

I never am at this family?

I also need to get away.
You must to be in school.

Where is the honor service?

In Tel Aviv.

Why can not I go?
It is not for you.

But what about after the honor service?
We can do something in Tel Aviv.

Your father and I need be alone.

Why do I always that left at home?

It's not fair. It is cruel!

We ask for a neighbor
to look after you.

A young woman who lives
cross the way.

Yardena?

You know her?
She works at the bakery.

You are right.
I can be such a selfish child.

Always thinking about myself.

Never thinking about my parents.

Go to honor service
and have a wonderful time.

Hello.
<i>- Shalom</i> everyone.

<i>- Shalom,</i> Yardena.
<i>- Shalom,</i> Proffy.

So, there is plenty of
food in the kitchen...

for the next two days,
make sure you eat all of it.

And Proffy? Be a good boy?

Have a good time.
<i>Nisiya Tovah. </i>

Bye.

Bye, Proffy.

So, you are a little traitor,
boy, aren't you?

I am not a traitor.
We discuss that later.

Come, let's make a super dinner!

You want coffee?
Who? Me?

Is anybody else at this dinner party?

Sure, I'd like some.

Is it too strong?
No, it's delicious.

So tell me...

you passed secret to the British?

Never.

They put you on trial, no?
They ask me few questions.

Proffy, you know, you can tell me anything.

I know how to keep a secrets.

Are you in the underground?

Oh yes, I pass the secret undergroung
for <i>rugalach</i>...

and hide weapons in
<i>Challah, all Shabbat. </i>

So, what was so interesting
about this British man?

I find most of them
so boring, no passion.

Sergeant Dunlop had a passion.

Yes? How do you know?

I talk to him a lot of things.

Like what?
Like you.

Me?
You do not know me.

But, I know a lot about you.

And the Sergeant Dunlop is interested
in everything I had to say.

You know, when I close my eyes
and try to think of Sergeant Dunlop...

I can see him clearly.
His pink skin...

his short fingernails
his big eyebrows.

But when close my eyes
and try to think of papa...

it's hard to see him.

I do not know how papa's teeth...

because he never smiles.

So, where is your
British soldier now?

He went back to Britain.

Yes, they all are to leave soon.

I just hope we don't regret...

when we are without them.

The British must go.

It would be
It would be disappearing.

I mean, I was...

but the rest of them
we have to drive out.

We will...

but not tonight.

Look at the time.
It's almost almost 11.

And tell me, are you sound sleeper?

Yes. No.

It depends.

Well, tonight it's better to sleep soundly.
Why?

If you do happen to wake up
we can turn on the light...

and read until the morning if you want,
but do not you dare leave your room.

Promise?
Promise.

Hi, my love.

Where's the boy?
Locked in his room.

Sure.

<i>Is already open?</i>

<i>This is easier. </i>

<i>- BoKer Tov, yeled.
BoKer Tov. </i>

Your parents will be home this afternoon.

Are you ready for school?

I don't have to go to school every day.

Really?

What kind of school is that?

I know all that teach in school.

I did not realize that you are so smart.

I am not.

It's just my class is too slow for me.

Maybe you can
teach me something.

Like what?
Like things of life.

Do not you have
your binoculars for that?

Now go to school.

I will be gone
when you come back...

and your parents will be home.

When I'll be your age
you will be 27.

So?

So I'll be taller than you by than.
Probably.

Can I tell you something?

Yes.

You know, I never talked
as you are beautiful.

You know why?

Because you are too beautiful.
You are just too beautiful.

Thank you, Proffy.
You are welcome.

Do you speak Hebrew?
Not yet.

I wanted to talk to you,

Really? Why don't you?

You are not just beautiful,

UN resolution

Why? Why Mexico is abstains?

Why Mexico have to abstain it?
How we are doing?

So far, so good.

<i>Yes. </i>
Yes! Yes!

<i>- Pakistan. </i>

<i>Against. </i>

<i>- Damn!
Panama. </i>

<i>Yes. </i>

How many did not vote?
How many?

How many?
Wait.

Wait. I'm counting.
Come on, Mom. How many?

<i>The resolution of this Committee
of the UN for Palestine... </i>

<i>was adopted by 33 votes,
13 against and 10 abstains. </i>

See what happened?

It will be good, right?

The crash between Israelis
and the Palestinians...

is a tragedy.
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

Neither Israeli Jews...
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

nor Arabs of Palestine...
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

can find national homeland anywhere else.

The Zionism, for my family...

was not a matter making a choice
in travel agency.

It was there only life choice.

If there is a fire...

you can run for your life...

and let those who can not run burn.

Or you can fill a bucket...

or a glass...

or a teaspoon of water...

to pour it to the flames.

The fire is huge and a teaspoon is...

very small, but every men and women...

have a teaspoon.

Each of us,
who shares this hope...

will wear a tiny teaspoon on your lapels.

So that we know.

Thank you.

<i>We would like to thank
to Professor Avi Leibowitz... </i>

<i>- for this wonderful work.
Thanks. </i>

Thank you so much.
Wery well.

Bye.
Bye.

I came across tha passage

"the child grew, by Samuel...

and was in favor
