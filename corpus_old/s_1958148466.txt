deep water is where
the alligators like to lurk.

â™ª

We're here and one's
down by our camp.

We're here and
one's up this creek.

One's over here, which
we've never heard before.

This could be deadly.

There's a gator right there.

It's about an
eight-foot alligator.

Oh, [bleep].

â™ª

Whoo!

All right.

Narrator: Over 10 seasons,
the "naked and afraid" challenge

has proven to be the ultimate
test of endurance and skill...

Holy [bleep]. It's working.

Narrator: ...Where
extreme necessity...

No sleep, no
food. It's miserable.

Narrator: ...Demands
innovative solutions...

What if we had an a-frame
coming out this way?

I hope this works.

Narrator: ...And ingenuity...

Seems to be a taj mahal by
the end of a couple days here.

Narrator: ...Is
often the difference

between success...

Fire!

I made a door.
Nice work.

Narrator: ...And failure.

Holy [bleep].

Narrator: From
customized tools...

Anything that you need,
you're gonna have to make it.

Got us a bow.

Narrator: ...To
complex structures...

Just decide it's time now
we go black macgyver on this.

Narrator: Survivalists
break down the process...

If we don't keep experimenting,

you're never gonna find out
what that magical solution is.

Narrator: ...Of
what went right...

Yes!

Narrator: ...And wrong...

Ay!

Narrator: ...When they tried
to outsmart mother nature.

Woman: Oh, my god, we have fire!

Narrator: ...For 21 days.

Whoo!

Oh, my god.
High-five, good job.

[ speaks indistinctly ]

holy [bleep].
Right!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Yeah!

the bugs are terrible.
We need a fire.

One of the most
essential problems

the survivalists
must solve is fire...

I'm failing miserably.

Narrator: But in
difficult conditions,

traditional methods
must often be reimagined.

We have to have fire
because we're really cold.

It's difficult enough
to start a fire

in a primitive environment.

Man: Everything's wet here.

Sarah: It's about the kind
of tinder that you're using,

the kind of wood
you have available,

the conditions that
you're starting the fire in.

Damnit!

Bone makes a great top piece
because it's not gonna burn.

You ready?
I'm mad.

Come on, ej.

[ groaning ]

narrator: In the yucatÃ¡n,

where fire to boil
water was essential...

Luke: Oh, god. Looks like urine.

Narrator: ...One
survivalist exemplified

the spirit of ingenuity
more than most.

[ squeaking ]

I'm just gonna go slow with it.

Trying to start
fire in the yucatÃ¡n

was quite the challenge.

The water was stagnant.

So you need to be able
to boil that to purify it.

And the bugs were
constantly there

and they were constantly on you

and they were
constantly annoying you.

You're doing awesome.
Oh, that little [bleep]

is biting the back
of my leg right now.

The only way that you're
gonna keep them away is fire

and the smoke from the fire.

So we absolutely
had to have a fire.

Oh, my hands are
getting all slippery.

God, it smells hot.

When it comes to making
fire, you've got tons of options.

The most basic
is the hand drill.

You need a simple
little board with a notch,

a long, skinny stick,

and you rub them as
fast together as you can.

It creates enough
friction to create an ember

that you drop into
a tinder bundle

and give it some oxygen
and bursts into flames.

It's just sitting there
cooking the wood.

My hands are starting
to get rubbed raw,

my muscles are getting
tired, and it got to a point

where I realized really
quick that we're gonna need

to figure out something
a little more efficient.

Okay, I think I'm gonna
start cranking it, ready?

All right, go.

Luke: The great
thing about a bow drill

is it allows you to turn
the spindle about 10 times

faster than you can
with the hand drill

with a third of the energy.

While you can be
more efficient with it,

it's a lot more difficult
to keep under control.

It pops out of the board a lot.

The cord can make it
fly in different directions.

â™ª

[ groans ]
ugh.

It was time for
technique number three.

I decided I was gonna make
my version of a pump drill.

Just a different idea.

I've split a stick
down the middle here

so that I could get
this little wedge in here.

It works the same
way as the bow drill,

but you need to
figure out some way

to put weight on
each side of it.

I'm gonna fill each
of these with rocks.

I'm gonna put
one on either side.

Like that, so these
will spin with the stick.

It might actually work.

And then you hang
a piece of wood

with a piece of cordage
going up over it and twist it up.

When you pull the
two handles down,

it untwists it and
the centrifugal force

brings it back up and twists
it back up around the spindle.

â™ª

Energy-wise, it's an
extremely efficient method.

â™ª

The centrifugal
force of the rocks

is doing most of the work.

All you're doing is pumping
it every few seconds.

Oh, it's bending in the middle.

This is done, shot.

In hindsight, it's
something that looks

really good on paper,

but is not that easy
to pull off in nature.

To make it work,
I would've needed

a perfectly straight stick
that was twice as strong.

And that's not that easy
to find in the yucatÃ¡n.

Woman: At this point,
no idea is a bad idea.

This cord is stronger
than any other one.

Strongest cord yet, huh?

But you know, if you
don't keep experimenting,

you're never gonna find out
what that magical solution is.

â™ª

Okay. I know, okay.
It's coal. It's totally coal.

That's gonna be it right there.

Come on, baby.

There you go.

There we go.
Oh!

Oh, my god, we have fire!
There we go!

All right, partner.
Awesome!

Luke: Every failure we had
was a learning experience.

And it's because of those
failures that we figured out

what was gonna work.

And that's why
we finally got it.

This is... Christmas.

â™ª

Narrator: In the exumas,

sarah proved that
sometimes the solution

is right in front
of your face...

So I gather you've
done this before.

Yeah, we'll have fire today.

Narrator: ...If you have
the creativity to see it.

Without fire, we
couldn't cook anything

and we didn't want to be eating
raw sea snails the entire time.

[ coughs ]

â™ª

These bifocal
lenses and this mask

have magnification properties

that are indicative of
the ability to make a fire.

I had equip my dive
mask with bifocal lenses

so that I would be better able

to see things up close
while I was scuba diving.

They're not a very
strong prescription.

They're basically
like reading glasses.

But I did have an idea

that I'd be able to
start a fire with them,

although it was not
something I had done before.

It's not an exact science.

It's more of a trial and
error kind of a thing.

First, I tried using a single
lens that wasn't working.

Then I tried using a double
lens that was almost working.

Yeah, I thought there
was smoking, for sure.

What if we rub one of
those pieces of tinder

in the charcoal?

We were able to grind up
charcoal in with the tinder

to lower the ignition
point of the tinder bundle

so that the magnification lenses

would be able
to ignite the fire,

so put that inside and
it'll get hotter faster.

â™ª

It's happening.
Yeah.

â™ª

There is nothing more
satisfying than starting a fire

when you desperately need it.

It feels amazing.

Ooh, hoo, hoo!
[ giggles ] I did it.

[ laughs ]

fire!

That was probably the first

and by far the most
satisfying fire I have ever built.

Let me flap my feathers.

[ laughs ]

â™ª

Ah.
We have to find water.

We've got water right there.

We've got to find
a way to process it.

Narrator: With fire
comes the ability

to boil and purify water.

Ah.

Narrator: But when fire fails,

the survivalist must
devise new methods

to capture every
fresh drop they can.

Man: Oh, shoot.

I can't believe how
much it's raining right now.

This is insane.

You just put one of
these at the bottom.

Narrator: ...From
rainfall traps...

Drink, drink!
Oh, my god.

Narrator: ...And seep wells...

It's a very small trickle.

Narrator: ...To natural
filtration systems.

Charcoal pulls
all the impurities

out of water and
filters it and cleans it

and makes it drinkable.

It's great.

I remember that the
moss round here has iodine

which use iodine
for purification water.

As far as filter and water

there are several ways that
you can sit here and filter.

Our problem was we
couldn't find any damn water.

It wasn't there.

â™ª

Don't it suck there is so much
water out there in front of us

and we cannot drink it?

This location in
the philippines,

there wasn't a fresh
water to be found.

No creeks, no ponds, no
streams, no lakes, nothing.

â™ª

Woman: So hot.

Out here, if you want
something, you go get it.

We need a long-term
source of water.

We got to find that water.
Yep.

I figure somewhere
on this island,

we got a water table.

You got the wet
season in the philippines

where it's getting just
drenched with rain.

It's gonna seep down
through the ground

and it's gonna hold down
there around the sand.

So we have to get out there
and we had to dig a well.

I definitely can tell that
I'm getting dehydrated.

Oh, absolutely.

I was looking for a low area at
possibly held water at one time

and I was looking
for green plants

that are just thriving off of
water source somewhere.

Being out here,
it's hot, it's humid.

It really pulls all the
moisture out of you.

I remember when we
started digging this thing,

I knew I wasn't gonna
hit in a couple feet.

You know, I was thinking
maybe, you know, five, six feet.

Let's see it.

It's getting moist.

Let me jump in now, yeah?

And as it turns out,

it was at least eight feet
before I hit a water table...

Whoo!

Jeremy: ...Which I
think has to be a record

on "naked and afraid."

I don't think anybody's
dug a well that deep.

I got to throw that in there.

We finally get the
water pot collected,

me and cassidy
finally got that fire going

and that was a huge
morale boost right there.

This is just such a huge moment.

I figured, long as we
got that water well,

long as this working, we
was gonna make our 21 days.

I'm sorry?

As thirsty as I was
drinking my own pee

really never crossed my mind.

Too damn hot.

Narrator: In guyana,

extreme heat led
fans survivalist shane

to a hydration method
few ever considered.

I don't think I've
ever been this thirsty.

In the lid?
Yeah.

Why?
'cause I'm thirsty.

I'll eat rat, I'll eat anything.

I will never drink my
own urine for survival.

Woman: He is gonna
drink from the lid.

There's definitely a reason
why your body dismisses urine

because it is not
fit for drinking.

No pee for me.

I have to be pretty close
to death's door to try that.

Just now looking
back, I'd have done it.

[ laughs ]

[ vomits ]

are you okay?

[ vomits, coughs ]

narrator: Coming up...

What kind of shelter
are you thinking?

Something simple.

Oh, damn.

This is so not fun.

We had to consider
bugs, floods, wind.

It was an intense environment.

Build the shelter.

Now that's a fireplace.

It's pretty solid.
Yeah.

Oh.
Oh!

What kind of shelter
are you thinking?

Something simple.

What if we had an a-frame
coming out this way?

We're just running out of time

and it's, like, freaking me
out a little bit to be honest.

I'm with you.

This is probably
the worst shelter

that anyone has
ever constructed.

A lot of survival

it comes down to
engineering and physics.

Shelter's a priority just to
get away from all the critters.

To do something right
to where it'll work for you

and it won't fail is
an essential skill.

Man: Oh, this is is nice.

Darrin: You can't afford
to waste your energy.

Oh.
Ow!

Oh!

Whoa, [bleep].

Ow.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

I've had about
enough of this [bleep]!

Narrator: In the hill
country of northern india

where cold air crashes down
from the himalayan mountains

two survivalists had to take
their shelter building skills

to a whole new level.

It's cold out here.

Oh, damn, it's cold.

In our location in india,

we're about 6,400
feet elevation.

I might have to go a
little bit slower up this hill

because I'm feeling...

Okay.

During the daytime, it
normally didn't get over

about 60 degrees.

At night, we're looking
at, like, 30 degrees.

How you feeling?
Really cold.

I wanna get this started.

Our first shelter
that we built was

an a-frame debris shelter

and the debris helped us
trapped in our body heat.

It worked as an
insulating layer,

but the shelter had
to be small enough.

â™ª

These nights have
been challenging.

It's been unseasonably cold.

I'm really worried that

I won't be able to stay
warm enough tonight.

Oh, damn.

Hakim: As far as
debris shelters go,

I mean, it was a great shelter,

but my partner phaedra
had less body mass than me.

She was really freezing.

I don't know if you
understand how cold I get.

Every single night is,
like, a disaster for me.

Hakim: And we knew
that we were gonna have

to build something better.

We were both going to
make it through this challenge.

What do you think about
bringing a little fire inside?

Like a fireplace? Okay.

So you want your
fire pit like that.

Phaedra thought that
fire was really important

and I thought the shelter
was really important.

So we tried to combine the two.

I just decided, hey,
you know what?

It's time now we go black
macgyver on this, you know,

so we wanted to pretty
much make a log cabin.

We took a lot of pine saplings
and that created our front wall

and our sidewall.

The gaps in between the logs,

we filled those
with moss and mud.

We need double this amount
if we want to be waterproof.

Okay.

And that allowed us
to keep a lot of the heat

enclosed in there,

but also to keep the
elements from outside

from flowing
through really easily.

The roof was made
of a few saplings

and then on top of that,
we took bark off of trees

and we used that as shingles
to help shed the water.

The fireplace had to
be completely enclosed

and we did that using
mud, moss, and rocks.

Now that's a fireplace.

Hopefully, we'll
see what happens.

So at the end, we had a shelter

that was totally enclosed
with a chimney system

that had the smoke
going up and out.

There was a lot that
went into the design.

â™ª

So we're about to cook up
some crabs that we found today.

Cooking them on a hot stone.

The shelter worked.

It was a great success because
it represented compromise

between what she
needed and what I needed.

Okay, this is effing good.
Good night.

Narrator: Perhaps the ultimate
test of a shelter's strength

came in the storm
ravaged marsh land

of the wekiva river basin.

It's very dense in here.

Our location in
florida was no joke.

We were in a swamp.

Wow, yeah, this is...

Looks a little
different, doesn't it?

Mm-hmm.

We had to consider
bugs, floods, rain, wind,

it was an intense environment
to try to build the shelter.

One shelter that I know about,

it's a double lean to
or like an a-frame --

Mm-hmm.

But it actually it tapers down.
Yeah.

Are you down with that?
Yeah.

We knew we needed a shelter

that's gonna withstand
crazy rain, crazy winds.

That was our main goal.

So the design that we came up

with was sort of a
modified lean-to situation

where we were stacking
sticks onto an existing tree.

So we had an anchored
point to help with a secure build

and something that we
knew we could rely on.

After we had that really
strong anchor point,

we built these beams coming
from the top of the anchor point

against the tree
down to the ground.

We got --
We could put lats.

Yeah, we can put
here and then...

Lats across the way, yeah.
Yeah.

The palms in there.
Mm-hmm.

What that was gonna do was
gonna give us a support network

for our lattice to hold all
of our palm fronds shingles.

And our palm frond shingles

didn't just stop at the ground,

they actually extended
outward several feet.

And that created no
possible way for that wind

or that rain to get
blown in sideways

and mess with us
inside our shelter.

We'll be all right. Hope so.

Those first few
days with our shelter

were really like a test run.

Man, it's coming down.
Yeah.

â™ª

Well, it's a good
time to fix leaks.

We got hit with
some rain and wind.

So we're out there,
we're constantly tweaking

with our shelter
and fixing the roof

and it just keeps
raining and raining

and then raining some more.

[ thunder crashes ]

it's pouring down
outside, like, pouring down.

I'm kind of nervous that
the lake that we're by

will rise up and
come into our shelter.

What we didn't realize
is that we were seeing

the early notes of
what was gonna be

one of the strongest
hurricanes ever recorded.

â™ª

I mean, it was knocking
trees over all around us.

It became pretty clear
pretty quickly that we were

in a dangerous scenario.

Amal and duke?
Yeah?

We have a safety issue.

We need to take you out.
Okay.

We need to go now.

The producers
came in and took us

to an offsite location until
it was safe to go back in.

And honestly, I didn't expect
to ever see that shelter again.

â™ª

Oh, my god.
It's crazy.

Duke: We're finally cleared
to go back to our location

and we're walking in,

it literally looks
like a battlefield.

Amal: Nothing
even looks the same.

We come around the corner,

we see that despite
the craziness,

our shelter withstood
a [bleep] hurricane.

It looks usable as
long as it's not...

Whoo! Yes!
...Flooded.

All of the shingles
are still on it,

like, our shelter's still there.

We are ecstatic.

Our tinder that we put
up here still very dry.

Oh, dude.

It's just a little bit
of wetness in there

and just some
holes here and there.

But the hurricane
did not win. [ laughs ]

narrator: Coming up.

There are all types of
dangers in every direction,

snakes, and there were
alligators everywhere.

So it'll be a noose at one end

and I'm gonna pull
it from the other end

once we get it around
the gator's neck.

Whoo!

Let's try to steer
clear of this spot.

Narrator: When competing
for food with the world's

most evolved predators...

[ roars ]

[ growling ]

narrator: ...The
survivalists have to create

any advantage they can.

Oh, [bleep].

Hey... [ speaks indistinctly ]

[ screams ]

I found a hollowed
log on the bank.

Let me get it to where
these crayfish swim in here.

I just had to try
everything, you know?

I had try all the skills I got.

Hmm. Perfect fit there.

Green ants in there for bait.

Improvising on
different skill sets,

you know, as far as,
like, what kind of trap?

Aah! [bleep].

Holly: Get it, get it, get it!

Dan: You got to be persistent
and you've got to know that

if you're doing the
right steps, it will pay off.

I've added a barb
to the spear point.

Holy [bleep].

All right!
Oh, my god.

And know that your 1 out of 10

is gonna turn up
eventually, you know?

â™ª Got myself a prawny prawn â™ª

â™ª

Narrator: In south africa,
an experienced hunter

had to adapt his backwoods
skills to a strange land.

I decided early on in a
challenge to go ahead

and make a hunting implement.

I've been making bows
since I was like 4 years old.

I'm no stranger to
that hunting weapon,

but I don't know the
materials out there in africa.

So I have to trust my skills
and work with what I have

and then hope
for the best on it.

You want pretty dense
timber to start with.

That may work. It
very well may work.

My normal rule of thumb
with making a long bow

is I make the bow as
tall as the shooter is,

because if we have a little
short bow with the limbs

you've got to bend
back so much further

it's more likely to bust.

As far as bow wood, you
want a hard, dense wood

because if you have
something that's real sluggish

and weak, well, it's either
gonna break or when you pull it,

it's gonna be bent.

What are you
using for the arrow?

That square stuff I
do for a hand drill.

It works great. I'm
gonna see what happens.

The biggest thing is
having a good arrow

because if you don't, if
you don't take your time

and flesh it right,
you'll have a strand.

And a strand and six
inches don't seem like much

until you -- until you're
shooting at a rabbit,

you know?

You need it
straight, very straight,

and there's not a lot of
straight sticks in nature.

So you improvise,
use fire, heat it up,

bend it into place
where you need it

and straighten it.

I heat it up right here,

I hold it place once it's hot,

and once I let go, it'll
stay. It's pretty neat.

One trick to measure an arrow,

you take the end of the
arrow, put it on your throat,

my middle fingers where
they end right there,

that's how long
your arrow should be.

There it is.

This arrow right here is
tipped with a piece of bone.

You know, the
penetration's not very deep.

With the arrowhead,
you can sharpen

the end of the stick
and it would work,

but I want a bigger
cutting blade.

So what I do is I take a
piece of bone, I sharpen it up,

tie it up with some
cordage, works great.

What the feathers do,
they guide the arrow

in a straight path
as they do a bird.

Baobab, tree of life.

For the cordage, I go
back to the baobab tree.

It made really good cordage

because the
elephants would strip it,

then they would chew on it.

So it was pliable.

Twist clockwise,
wrap counterclockwise.

It's simple, but it's what
holds the whole thing together

and it works great.

And the moment of truth.

We got us a bow.

Oh, yeah.

It wasn't the prettiest
bow I've ever made.

It's what you call
a survival bow.

I don't need it to be
pretty. I need it to work.

This is awesome.
You're really impressive.

Thank you.

[ bleep ]

now I got some shots off,

but the animals out
there are elusive.


But the bow, it
felt great, actually.

I would've loved to
have been able to just

bring it home with me.

I would've been able to
take it out here in arkansas

and so some small
game hunting with it.

Look at all the animal
dung around here.

Oh, [bleep].


â™ª

Narrator: In the
florida everglades,

a different ryan
needed the right tool

for a very deadly task,

ryan: Surviving
in the everglades

was a huge challenge
for me right off the bat.

There are all types of
dangers in every direction.

Florida panthers,
venomous snakes,

and there were
alligators everywhere.

We're here and one's
down by the camp,

we're here and
one's up this creek.

One's over here, wish we
never knew that they were there.

There's a gator
nest right in here.

They like to make their
nests in the middle of these.

All right, I'll go over there.
I'm not.

Why don't you wanna go?
I'm not stupid.

I don't, like, not
think things through.

Earlier on in the challenge,

my partner amber gave
me quite the hard time

about not wanting
to go after gators.

We're gonna gator hunt.

You have to go
to places like that

to catch a gator.

There is no exceptions.
There is an exception.

It's called thinking.

It's called you being a [bleep].

Up to this point,

I feel like I had
been very successful

with my hunting capabilities

and my intake on
protein from a fish.

Ha ha! Whoo!

My partner amber
had just tapped out.

Amber: My body aches so bad.

And I knew I needed
to find some source,

a bigger protein, to
help me get to extraction.

The only thing that seems to
be left around here is alligators.

It was time to take
it to that next level.

Last night I woke
from a dream that I had.

And it was someone
that was using giant

boomsticks with a noose on it.

I laid awake for an hour or
more last night just thinking about

how I can create one of
those with natural materials.

The boomstick noose
is a pretty basic concept,

if you've ever seen a
dog catcher using one.

So here I've got my 12-foot
boomstick that I found.

The next piece of
material I needed

was a durable vine.

And that's gonna be the noose.

So it'll be a noose at one end

and I'm gonna pull
it from the other end

once we get it around
the gator's neck.

And in order to
fasten that noose,

I had to find smaller vines to
make a bunch of fixed circles.

At the very end of
my broomstick noose,

I had six to eight of them.

That's where the most
durability had to be.

That's where the most
fight was gonna come from.

And by fixing these circles,

I had made to
the top of the pole,

I was able to run the vine
through all the fixed circles.

So once you pull it through,
that noose on the end

starts to get smaller and
cinches tighter together.

In my mind, it was gonna be
strong enough and durable enough

to go after an eight
to 10-foot alligator.

[ water splashes ]

I just heard this intense
splashing around over there.

Morning of day 18,

this huge splash happens
off to my right hand side.

Right then, I knew I
had something big.

I knew that this was the
moment I'd been waiting for.

Stay there.

Whoo!

He ain't going anywhere
with this thing on him.

The alligator broomstick
noose worked flawlessly.

We're gonna go and
take care of this one now.

But I spent a
little too much time

getting up on the alligator
and finishing the job.

The noose actually broke off

the alligator's neck and
he started to barrel roll.

â™ª

All right.

It wasn't very clean,
but it was quick.

Having crafted something
out of natural materials

after everything I've
learned throughout my life

and in implementing
it in a real time

survival situation,

it was probably one of
the greatest moments,

honestly, of my life.

Remember when
amber called me a [bleep]

said I was scared of alligators?

Ha!

â™ª

Narrator: In another
florida swamp location,

the spark of inspiration came
in a very unexpected moment.

Wow.
Oh, see some water.

Ah, yes.
Yep.

Amal: Where we were at was
obviously very swampy and wet.

So a couple times I would
go into the creek to pee.

And each time I peed, I noticed
that the fish would get closer.

â™ª

Mm. They are first.

Human urine and a
lot of other bodily fluids

actually have a lot of proteins
that attracts certain animals.

And so, I put two and
two together and I was like,

"oh, I can actually attract
them to you this way."

wow.

The next time around I
went out there and I was like,

okay, I'm gonna catch
some fish with my pee.

And I didn't tell nobody that

'cause they don't want
to be embarrassed.

I'm gonna do a
little bit fishing.

There's a bunch of
baby ones over there.

Sweet, okay. Good luck.

I was like, let me make
sure I can catch these fish

before I go out there

and promise something
that's not gonna happen.

â™ª

We didn't have a fishing net,

we didn't have fishing line,
hooks or anything like that.

But I had to pee
and I had a bag.

â™ª

I did it just one time.

I had the bag and then
I peed really close to it.

The fish swam up and
basically went right into the bag.

Got some.

Hey, duke, grab
the pot, if you can.

I just caught some fish
and I don't wanna put it

back in the water 'cause
I don't wanna lose them.

Awesome. What's your technique?

It's kind of gross, to
be honest with you.

When you pee in
the water, they smell it

and then they kind
of get attracted to it

and they just kind
of linger right here.

That's what they're
doing right now.

Oh, that's hilarious.

I was kind of like,

did you plan that?

Was that accidental?

We'll put them in here for now,

but we can come up
with a better container.

Yeah.

It's not how I
usually catch fish,

but if it's gonna
get us some protein,

I love you, girl. Get it.

Drink some water. Do it again.

This is so awesome.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Well, this is really exciting.

You take every win you can get.

You appreciate every
little scrumptious bite,

no matter how you got it.

Oh, my gosh. Here we go.

But the fish maybe did
taste interesting with kind of,

I don't know, like a
tangy after note, perhaps.

You know, they're tiny,

that's definitely
good protein for us.

I'm so thankful.

Thank you for your
amazing technique.

No problem.

Oh, I feel really good
about that. I am so happy.

[ laughs ]

narrator: Coming up...

The sun is killing me.

This place is brutal on my skin.

[ buzzing ]

oh, what are those
horse flies after? My life?

It's for your sunburn.
Oh.

Making a little
warthog fat lotion.

And it feels so good.

Only problem with this is
that it turns your skin purple.

â™ª

â™ª

Narrator: From the moment
the challenge begins,

a skilled survivalist
wastes no time identifying

the innovative possibilities
of their surroundings.

Oh, man.

We can use it later
for some good cheese.

Oh, wow.

Charcoal makes
a good toothpaste.

Once you step foot out there,

your wheels are turning,
your mind's going.

You're looking for things
that's gonna be able

to help you later on.

I see a shoulder bone.

I don't see it just
as a shoulder bone.

I see it as a shovel.

I don't see just an antler, I
see spear points or an all,

which is a hole punch

because there's no store around.

Amazon's not
gonna send it to you.

Looks like a leg bone.

That may come in use, thank you.

You might not need
them right then and there,

but I can promise
you later you will.

Let's do this.
[ laughs ]

â™ª

There's a thorn in there.

Aah!

Narrator: From
thorn-covered jungles...

Ow. [bleep].

Narrator: ...To sun
scorched deserts...

The survivalists' need
to protect their feet

has inspired a
variety of solutions.

That is a partner, using
her hair for my feet.

How's that?

Oh, yeah. That's so much better.

Angela, you gotta
size them to your feet.

And I had this rope,
so I pulled apart

those inner strands to
bind the sandals together.

You tie a little string

onto that and then little
loop behind your heel

and you go over the top of
your foot and tie it together,

and it's super
simple, but it's secure.

They lasted the entire
challenge and have been

on several backpacking
trips with me in the utah desert

and they're still going strong.

Angela: I wouldn't
be able to walk

this far without these shoes.

Narrator: In south africa, a
chance discovery gave ryan

just the raw material
his feet needed.

Ryan: I see a animal hide.

Around day five, I stumbled
across this hide I found.

It was big, it was
in great shape.

Oh, yeah.

I knew right then and
there that that's a jackpot.

It may look bad,

probably smells a little
bad, but that's a resource

I ain't gonna pass up.

The hide, luckily, has
already been picked clean,

so I don't have to
do any scraping.

All I had to do is
just soak in the water

and then it was very
pliable, much easier to use,

and I could shape it to
the contour of my foot.

Let's hope it works.

It's a lot of
effort if it don't.

I cut two really big pieces.

Then all I had to do
is just make the laces,

which I made them
out of baobab cordage.

That's a shoestring.

Now what I need
is a leather punch.

So let me run to
the store real fast.

There it is.

That's when the bone
come in handy that I found.

All I did was sharpen it up,

punched a hole to
sew up the leather.

Boom, piece of cake, baby.

That's nice. Now we'll
go fire to harden these.

I would harden
the bottom of them

by stepping on hot coals.

Once you put the
leather on the heat,

what it does is
constrict and it hardens

and it makes for a really,
really good pair of shoes.

What this is doing is just
taking the moisture out

and it fit my feet.

I could feel them right
now just shrinking up,

just fitting my
feet like a glove.

Oh, yeah. Bring
it [bleep] thorns.

It opened up a whole
new set of doors

as far as being able to travel
out there, trek through thorns,

and briars with no problems.

So much easier traveling
with good shoes. So nice.

â™ª

Nike can kiss my ass.

Narrator: The risk of exposure

extends well beyond
the survivalists' feet...

The sun is killing me.

Narrator: ...As
extreme sunburn...

Woman: I've never
had a sunburn this bad.

Narrator: ...And ravenous bugs
wreak havoc on the naked body.

Woman: What are those
horse flies after? My life?

Narrator: Making
natural remedies

and creative
concoctions a necessity.

The noni leaves are working.

My swelling in my foot's going
down. It's pretty awesome.

There is a tree. It's
the gumbo limbo tree.

It's for your sunburn.

It might hurt a little bit.

Oh.

Right now,

making a little
warthog fat lotion.

You just take some
fat and you can heat it

on a stick with that
elephant dung --

Yeah.

...And you can make some
good lotion for yourself.

I have been so
dry since day one,

and this is just amazing.

It just -- my skin
is just sucking it up

and it feels so good.

Right now, I'm
looking for a specific

root that helps with
skin inflammation

and acts as an antiseptic.

God, my legs were on fire.

Only problem with this is
that it turns your skin purple,

so we're gonna look
like smurfs tomorrow.

â™ª

Narrator: In panama,
desperation and ingenuity

combined to create
a very memorable,

primitive bug repellent.

I'm getting eaten alive by bugs.

They're, like, worse than
they have ever been, I swear.

One of my biggest
challenges being out there

were the chitras.

Ugh, these chitras are
driving me nuts today.

A little, you know, sand bugs.

They are very painful,
they're relentless.

Ugh, stop.

Oh, man, nature is a bitch.

I would put a lot of mud on
me. I would put ash in water.

That would help with keeping
the bugs away from me.

But there was one night I
didn't have time to go down

to the water to get
ready for the bugs.

I went ahead and did something

a little out of the ordinary.

I'm standing there
and I'm catching my pee

and I'm putting it on me.

And then I grab ash and I
use ash to keep it on my body.

Narrator: In addition to
serving as a liquid binding agent,

urine also contains
high levels of sodium,

which helps repel bugs.

I peed on myself
and I used the liquid

with the soot of the fire
and rubbed it all over me.

I have pee on my face.

[ sighs ]

narrator: Coming up...

It'll definitely work.

Time to go.

Hakim: We use this ingenuity
to adapt and overcome.

This is sailing.
We're sailing for real.

It was this great
sense of pride,

this great sense
of accomplishment.

There's a freaking reef
shark over here on my left.

Holy [bleep].
Oh.

â™ª

In survival, they say
the number one thing

is to build your shelter.

Well, clothing is your
number one shelter.

Yes.

And you know, I'm not a nudist.

I present to you, myself.

â™ª

Feel like a man now.

Check me out.

Whoo-hoo!

I cut a piece of
the bug net off.

I'm trying to keep the
bugs out of my goods.

[<i> bell dings</i> ]

if I could not see darrin naked

for the remainder
of the challenge,

that would be great.

[ music slows ]

what you think about
bra straps right here?

Oh, yeah. That's even
cleavage enhancing.

I had a really
bitching devo-style hat

that was actually a fish trap.

â™ª

We could save the skin,
make you a penis cover with it.

We could.

I don't know if that'll fit.

Oh, ah, no judging here, okay?

[ laughs ]

oh, my god. It's kind of far.

Yeah.

Looks like we have to dodge
some tons of crocodiles right there.

Narrator: As the challenge
comes to an end...

I think that's our next
push is building that raft.

Narrator: ...Oftentimes the
biggest creations are needed

to make it to the finish line.

Man: Now we've got the
flooring starting to go in.

Put some chairs on there.

That's some good
primitive work right here.

Tide's gonna be coming in.

So I'm gonna be battling
tide the whole time.

Woman: We can't
just go kicking our way

into shark infested waters.

Donesky.
Nice.

My extraction almost failed
if I hadn't thought ahead

to make a flotation device
to get me off the island.

It'll definitely work.

Time to go.

There we go.

I'll suck it up and go for it.


there is a freaking reef
shark over here on my left.

He got behind us.

Narrator: And when
you arrive by sea,

the only way to leave is by sea.

Look, the beach, there.

â™ª

I'm exhausted.
Yeah.

Let's just get it to the
closest piece of sand.

After we used the raft
to paddle to the island,

I thought perhaps we
would be able to use it

to leave on extraction day.

We're getting
extracted from that point.

It's about seven miles, I think.

But by the end of the challenge,

the life raft was nothing
more than a pile of junk.

That's a big tear.

And extraction was not
something I was ready

to do just by swimming.

It was a multi-leg journey
between two islands

with stingrays and
sharks in the water,

as well as the current
and the exposure.

Swimming was not an option.

There was no
way that the life raft

was gonna be useful
in any way as a boat.

However, it had a
lot of really good parts

I could use to make
something different.

I mean, surely
it'll leak a little bit.

But it might hold long
enough. Worth a try.

Sarah: There were bladders,

both of which had been
popped and needed to be tied.

There was some paracord,
there were some straps.

Every element of the life raft
was useful in its construction.

I based the design on the
hawaiian outrigger canoe.

It's basically a long
canoe that has an arm on it

that helps to aid in flotation
and keep it from capsizing.

[ blowing air ]

I use the inner
tubes for flotation,

wood from the beach
for infrastructure,

strapping from the raft
in order to tie it together,

and there was also
the bottom lining.

I figured could be
used to make a sail.

And I had crafted a mast out
of a branch that I had found.

We can lower it like this
and catch the wind this way.

We're gonna wind surf
out of this thing, huh?

Yeah.

Ben did not believe that
a sail was going to work.

And I just wanted
to prove him wrong.

Well...

There, what do you think?
It's [bleep] tight.

So I'm gonna be sitting here.
Yep.

And I'll be sitting
right back there.

â™ª

Are you ready
to grab onto the...

Yeah.

This is sailing.
We're sailing for real.

Good work. Nailed it.

I was so proud to
have pulled it together

and made something that
actually worked out there.

Do you want to go in
between the islands?

Yeah.

Sarah: We were cruising
out of there like champions.

Ha ha.

And I don't think that
I could have done it

without my ingenuity.

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

We did it. We did it.

Adios, exuma!

Every stroke burns.

Dig in deep, ej, I
know you're on empty.

It was this great
sense of pride,

this great sense
of accomplishment.

There is a boil.
[ exhales ]

that we use this ingenuity
to adapt and overcome,

to really win out at the end.

Every environment's different.

You never know what
you're gonna run into.

Cordage is breaking.

So creativity is essential.

That's it. We're able
to start hunting now.

In a survival situation,

I've always felt that
brains versus brawn

will win nine out of 10 times.

We did it. I'm so proud of you.

Improvise, adapt, and overcome.

Ah! Yeah!
Whoo!

We [bleep] did it!

That's survival.

Yeah!
Yeah!

Bye, amazon, thank you!
