We have a whole team that helps
with the anti-gravity stuff.

It looks amazing,
but actually hanging in the air

by your private parts,
on a wire, isn't that fun.

But you know,
you do it for the end result.

<i>Please!</i>

<i>Get me out of here!</i>

Traditionally in Sci-Fi, you begin
with a shot of space

and a spaceship crossing the frame.

And there was something very cool
about starting in a little storage locker

with somebody who's trapped,

and you don't have the full
context of what is happening

and then little-by-little,
as she breaks out of the locker,

you start to get context.

The whole floating thing,
that's quite challenging.

It's fun, super-fun, but at the same time
you know, you have to be very much aware of

every little movement,

everything you touch
causes a reaction, and...

at the same time you're just
reacting to the drama that's going on.

I knew that a lot of the technical stuff
was hanging on the slings, and you know,

people are going to be pulling me
up and down, and being pushed around,

and shaken up, and just a lot of it was
basically just having to be in the moment.

Breathing helps a lot.

<i>Ceres was covered in ice.</i>

Ceres, we think of it as sort of New York.

Has a large port, a lot of
shipments go through there.

it's sort of a way station
between Mars and Earth.

They've spun-up the asteroid
to give it gravity,

and then they essentially quarred it out,
using giant drilling machines.

So you have untold riches that
flow through its port.

Yet the Belters who service the ships,
and who unload and load them,

you know, really don't get to much
dissipate in the riches of the system,

and that's part of their big right.

<i>Every time we demand to be heard,
they hold back our water.</i>

<i>Watch your eyes.</i>

<i>People get killed over a
wrong look around here.</i>

<i>Hey, you, Badge.</i>

<i>- Welwala.
What is welwala?</i>

<i>"Traitor to my people."</i>

Miller, he is the guy who's
at war with his own identity.

He's a Belter born and raised,

but he's also identified with the
power structure against Belters,

so he victimizes the people
that he's a part of.

You know, he's a guy sinking.

And you should feel that he is
the guy who's compromised,

and you know, if Julie Mao
didn't come along,

Miller would just kind of fade
out like a red sun and disappear.

<i>So, what's my contract exactly?</i>

<i>Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on
Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.</i>

<i>Kidnap job. My pleasure.</i>

<i>It's been a long time comin'.</i>

<i>- Are you kidding?
No.</i>

<i>I thought I was getting
my walking papers.</i>

<i>What for?</i>

<i>Fraternizing with our
navigator, for starters.</i>

<i>- What?</i>
<i>When we meet Holden,</i>

Holden has spent his whole life
trying to answer to nobody.

He's run, he's run from any major
responsibility for other people.

He wants his life to be
simple, and loves being

on the Canterbury with
all these other outcasts.

Shooting anti-gravity sucks,

'cause it's far more complicated set
of circumstances than one might think.

I mean, we we're on wires that
were being pulled manually by people.

It was far less enjoyable then
I kind of was hoping it to be.

<i>Warning. Gravity hazard.</i>

I think ultimately, you know,
it's real, it's part of human nature.

Just because we're out in space
doesn't mean that, you know,

we've changed as a... as a species.

<i>Hey, Paj, how's the arm?</i>

<i>Looking good. Still got
a few nerves, though.</i>

We really bent over backwards to make
that environment feel homey and real,

and give the ship a lot
of character and people...

you felt like there's going to be all
sorts of interesting relationships

that are gonna happen over
the course of episodes.

<i>A ship just appeared
near your location.</i>

<i>How is that possible? You cleared
us out to a million clicks.</i>

The only way you feel lost,
like you do at the end of episode one,

is if you truly believe
that this is the place

that you gonna be with for a very
long time, that these are the people

that you gonna be
spending a series with.

<i>Torpedo launch!</i>

<i>We're gonna take 'em for a ride.
Alex, go around the asteroid.</i>

<i>Run 'em! Now!</i>

So when the Canterbury
gets blown up at the end,

it's really a shock.

<i>Canterbury, burn like hell,
you've got incoming!</i>

That whole lead after the end of the
episode, I find this very emotional when,

you know, that last moment perhaps,
between Ade and Holden

before the ship evaporates,
that still gets me.

<i>There's something you should know...</i>

<i>She's gone.</i>

<i>I'm looking for a girl,
her name is Julie.</i>

<i>She discovered something.</i>

<i>Something big.</i>

<i>If Mars and Earth get
into a throw down...</i>
