If you're watching this, I guess...

I'm dead.

If you're watching this
and I'm not...

then everything is fucked,
and I might as well be.

You know most people bitch, about...

the awful shit that happens
in world and they sit around...

and they wait for it all,
to sort itself out...

and it does.

All the bleeding stops, eventually.

Death is certain...

and life is far from it.

Jesus says "Turn The Other Cheek",
and God says "An Eye For An Eye".

Even in the Bible you've got to make
choices, you stop... and life is over.

Only you spend years, with
your ass pasted to a couch.

I took control.

Now I might, not of my life...

but of the circumstances...

of my death.

and in doing so, it means
everything that came before.

You think that'll be enough?

I don't know, but I tell
you what, man.

When I come knocking
on them purely gates...

St. Peter ain't gonna have to
look my name up in no book.

Give me a Scotch,
single malt, lemon twist.

Vodka Gimlet.
Vodka Gimlet?

What kind of Vodka?

Christ, never mind,
make'm both Scotch.

It's 9 bucks.

Keep the change.

Come here often?
Seriously?

Imagine me, in a dump.

I bet your lying.

What'd you drink?

What? You're the wing-man?

Don't think, you need a wing-man.

So, what's your name?

Why? You wont remember
it in the morning.

So long as we understand
each other.

Yeah, like trusting you.

How about the 3 of us,
go back to the suite?

You can suck on my cock, while
my friend humps you in the ass.

This is a joke, right?

You think I'm kidding?

I can read you like a book.

A dirty book.
With the pages stuck together.

Hey fellows!

Leave the lady alone.

Listen, friend, this has
nothing to do with you.

Why'd you get lost?

I just wanna say, first of
all, I'm not your friend and...

second!

Let's go.

Gotta go!

Gotta go!

You know, I could've
handle it myself.

I know, just thought,
I save you the trouble.

That's so considered.
That's what my daddy thought me.

Did he teach you to fight dirty?

No, that was my mama.

What's your name?
James.

Thank you, James.

For to long this country has...

sat on it's well fed hunches...

fiddling with their remote,
while the world burned.

Poverty, Aids, Genocide...

Melting Ice-caps,
spiking Oil-prices.

Our phone-calls are monitored...

our homes watch from space.

And what are we the people,
prepared to do about it?

Our For-fathers fought
a bloody war...

to free the nation,
from old King George.

"Don't" treat on me, they said.

Death to Tyrants.

Where has that Spirit gone?

We believe that the
Election was stolen...

We believe that the Constitution,
is being compromised...

that our Liberties and Freedom
being robbed from us...

in the name of Security...

if you're opposed to torture, to
think of Detention-camps, to murder...

and what are you as a person,
prepared to do about it?

Don't mistake passivity,
for morality.

Wake-up, Rise-up, Over-come.

That's perfect.
Yeah? Okay.

3 years ago

It's save to say, that George Orwellâ€™s'
novel from 1984 has come to passed.

But it's interesting to know...

the level, to which his utopian vision
of the future has already been surpassed.

For example, in 1900 the N.Y.City
Police-force, numbered 7,500...

per population of 3.5 million.

A hundred years later, the
population is barely doubled...

but the Police-force,
has grown to 40,000.

N.Y.City has a standing Army...

roughly equivalent, to a
Mid-size European Nation.

It's budget is 3 billon dollars.

Now, you combine that with
the Fire-department budget...

N.Y.City spends more on Security,
then the nuclear states of Pakistan...

and North Korea.

N.Y.City has a larger
Security budget...

then Iran, Syria, Libya
and Cuba combined.

George Orwell said "Freedom" is the
Freedom to say, that 2 + 2 equals 4.

If that is granted, then
everything else follows.

So, let me ask you...

what do you think all
these cops, add up to?

I love your book.
Thank you.

You're Ann, right?
With an "e".

Anne with an "e".

Thank you.

Hello.
Hello.

I thought... huh, what you
said, made a lot of sense.

Would you like our signet?

I... huh, don't have a copy.

That's alright, there's plenty to go
around, who should I make it out to?

Hanna, but don't.

Hanna, "but don't"?

I can't... I can't waste
money on a book.

Hey! Waste?

I don't mean waste, like...
it'll be thrown away, I just...

This one's on the house.

Now, the worst thing you'll
be wasting is your time.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

It is true that our founding
fathers were Atheists?

No, Theists.

They believed in a creator, they just
didn't believe in a particular religion.

So, then how did it get like this?
Like what?

So religious and judgmental.

They're not actually
the same thing.

Well. you know what I mean,
were we all so angry?

There was a Civil-war.

Yeah, but that was about
freeing the slaves, right?

Voltaire said...

So long as the people do not
care to exercise their Freedom...

those who wish to tyrannies,
will do so.

The Tyrants are active
and ardent...

and will devote themselves, in
the name of any number of Gods...

religious and otherwise...

to put shackles
upon sleepy men.

Who is Voltaire?

A Frenchmen.

You know what a Patriot is?

Huh... some one who
loves their country.

A person who defends
their country.

Nathan Hale, was a Patriot.

Malcolm X.

Malcolm X, was a... a Moslem, right?
That's right.

Didn't he hate America?

Well, at times, I'm sure he did, but
still, he defended her from injustice.

I never saw the movie.

Hm-mm.

Can I have the book back?

Oh, no, I... I didn't mean to, huh...
No. that's okay, no, no.

This is how to get a hold of me.

I run a group discussion.
I do politics mostly.

But there is hot
food and coffee and...

you should think about coming.

Okay, maybe I will.

The ride North was cake.

Anything we
got on our way...

we patch up and lined it
with depleted uranium.

No dealers.

Just shit they scraped
out of nuclear reactors.

Half life is 4.5 billion years.

We get to Bagdad,
everything is cool.

That's when Saddam
got his 4th of July.

Then 4 black men get strung up in
Felucca, everything goes to shit.

They ordered us to, capture
the responsible parties.

The hell, everyone's responsible.

What the fuck were those contractors
doing there in the first place?

So they get shot and we
have to waste an entire city.

And there Humvee...

we couldn't I.D.

And that fucker
split my leg open.

I nearly bleed to death.

It was 6 months, before I could
walk again and never expected...

getting wounded as
part of the deal.

Well, I couldn't get my
head around this...

4 days in, we finely had the fuckers
on the run, then they order us off.

Why?

Because there's an election...

and death Marines cost votes.

Then 4 days after the election
they ordered us back in.

Called it "Operation
Phantom and Fury", why?

It was bull-shit, I was a Carney
they brought to the desert...

so wise up America.

The only W.O.M.D's
are the ones we dropped.

And the terrorist are there
because we need an enemy.

With an Army, that gives
billions to corporations.

But cuts benefits for veterans.

Fuck'm.

The first man to die, in
the American Revolution...

was a black man.

Crispus Attucks.

Do you think the British
called him a hero?

Hell, no.

He was an insurgent.

So were the founding fathers.

And so are we.

6 years ago

It's dark in here.

Yeah.

That's the way I like it.
Oh yeah?

Wait, hold on, hold on.
Hm-mm?

I wanna look at you.

You like what you see?

Still would prefer blonds.

A good thing you just pretend one.

You got a radio in this place?

You know you gonna have to...
What?

Pretence.

I like to pretend.

Come on, let's dance.

I can't.

Come on, baby.

Stop this, I can't.

You know, it's only sometimes
when a girl says, let's dance...

I know, I know.

I'm not your type?

Girl, you're every mans type.

You don't like me.

I told you I was in a wreck, right?

Yeah.

Why do you think I'm home early?

I don't know, they let you out.

Why do you think they
let me come out early?

You got hurt or something,
but... you look fine.

Oh, Honey, I... I'm sorry.

Comes with the Territory.

But you're gonna get better, right?

Lie back.

Touch yourself.

You wanna watch?

I don't mind.

I think you should go.

We don't have to do anything,
we can just talk.

I thought I'd be ready, but...

Come here, come lay down.

Tell me about the war.

Should be one in the desk.

Is that it?
Yeah.

Wait, there's somethin' else.
Like what?

A souvenir.

What'd you think?

I'll do, man.

What?
Keys, let's have'm.

Get the fuck in.

Great.

Artisan aquA

Well, that was easy enough.

It only get's tougher from here.

You're not nervous, are you?
And, you ain't?

No.

I think you're full of shit,
everybody get's nervous.

What you and Robert want with
a truck full of water anyway?

How should I know?

He tells you things.

He tells everybody things,
you just have to listen.

It's been good listening.
I'm ready to do.

A time like this,
you gotta have patience.

That's what I'm talking about.

I don't mind waiting, why the
hell would somebody steal water?

You said you wanted do something.

Like something big, man,
this is Teen-age shit.

It's grand larceny, class B
felony, punishable by 25 years.

You mean we'd go to prison?

What's some black men you
think doing in a prison?

He didn't know shit about the law.

What's an educated black man
you think doing in a prison?

Have you?

Let me tell you something.

Prison is a plantation
by another name.

The government makes millions
of them with labor.

There's no Unions,
no minimum wage.

A black man is 50 times more
likely to be incarcerated...

than a white man, for the
same exact offence.

It's institutionalize slavery.

Slavery, huh?
Yes it is.

Maybe y'all should
stop selling drugs.

You think that's funny?

Because I could've gotten this
truck without your shitty ass...

Hey, I'm just saying.

You know you can't blame somebody
else forever, the Civil-war is over...

your people won.

Bull-shit, my people
didn't win a damn thing.

40 acres and a mule,
I'm still waiting.

If I buy you a Donkey,
would that square us?

What good's a Jack-ass
without the land?

I been to prison.

You've seen them (?) on TV.
naked and wire and shit.

I tell you, it's one fuckin' puck.

I tell you what, my parents they left
me some property, outside of Sheridan...

and there comes a time, if anything should
happened to me, I want you to have it.

Why me?

Well, it ain't 40 acres, but...

it's a start.

Hey man, don't talk like this.

Nothin's gonna happen.
If it does...

Look, oneâ€™ a this days you gonna have a
whole lotâ€™ a (?), out there runnin'...

you gonna need that land.

I'm just saying, I'm not
going back to prison.

Well, what'd you think?
Perfect.

Bring it inside,
put in the yard.

Hey, how'd it go?

We got the truck.

That's great.
Yeah, it's a class B.

Class what?

Nothin'.

Are you okay?
Yeah.

You nervous?
No, I'm not nervous.

Just, huh...
What?

Let's go some place,
just you and me.

To where?

I don't know, anywhere.

I can't just leave the
responsibilities, so do you.

Fuck responsibility.

Fuck Robert.

I meant to me, you're a
responsibility to me now.

That's what I'm saying.

What ever Robert's planning,
we haven't done anything.

Baby, we can start all over, okay?

You stole a truck.

I call Colby and tell'm
it was a mistake.

He don't give a shit,
call the police.

It doesn't matter, we'll go to Mexico,
we leave right now, like in the movies.

Listen to me, James,
I don't wanna go any where.

I'm not gonna go any where.

This thing matters, it's important.

Important to Robert.

It isn't his fault, James.
I haven't been brain-washed.

Then tell me.
What?

What is it, we're doing... here?

Hanna, really.

When I first met Robert, I thought
the world was against me.

It made me lonely and bitter...

and after those teachings,
I know the world is against me.

It isn't my fault...

and that makes me angry.

That teaches me faith...

and part of faith,
is not asking questions.

You're a fucking nut?

But once you embrace violence,
your results lose credibility...

like in Seattle.
Okay, fine, but...

that's my point exactly.

Before the direct action
in Seattle, nobody knew...

that the Anti-global-movement,
even existed.

Yeah, and afterwards no one cared, they
were the self described Anarchists.

Revolutions are never amassed fish.
you need a radicalized Vanguard.

And the challenge is,
in creating a group...

that is so disillusioned
with the status quo...

that they're willing to sacrifice
anything to change it.

Provoking government into...

waging war against their own people.

It's an incredible efficient
reason of accomplishing this.

By spilling blood?

The fact is, the harder they crack down,
the stronger the movement becomes.

In the 1960's the government infiltrated the
Left-wing and pushed it towards violence...

by the 1970's, the movement was dead.

Why, so what? Are you accusing
me of being a government agent?

Hey, he's accusing me of
being a government agent.

Hey, look, America
is a great frontier...

without the occasional
Forest-fire...

the next generation of trees,
will never grow.

And you're the man to light the match?
What?...

No, no, not me, not me at all,
I need others to stand with me.

I need those, who have nothing
to lose but their chains...

and the faith, that this great
country of ours, gonna be saved.

How many is that?

Fuck, if I know.

Hey, what is this place?
It's Roberts', he owns it.

Hey, how come we stole this thing...

and we're just gonna
dump all these out?

We need the bottles.

Hanna, would you get
the emptyâ€™s' inside.

Smells' like shit.

It's been closed for a while.

It'll be airing out now.

Fuses?

You're gonna build a bomb?

Mm-hm... a big one.

It's important to get the
the consistency right.

Not to dry, not to damp.

Why didn't you tell me?

Come on, you must have known.

You don't trust me?
Hanna!

She wanted to tell you,
and I told her not to.

Why?

Because, we all got
our roles to play.

Oh, yeah, what's mine?

The most important role of all.

So how long you think,
before it's finished?

Well, it's not the sort
of thing you can rush.

I know, but I wanna
hit them on Monday.

I wanna take advantage
of the new cycle.

I think we're gonna
be ready by then.

Me too.
Good.

What?

Do you think you'll
be ready on Monday?

Ready for what?
I still don't no shit.

We're gonna hit'm where it hurts.

You got enough to blow
a whole building.

2000 pounds.

What's the target?

The target in any revolutionary
action is the State.

When you do this,
than people are gonna die.

Politics change.
Butchery.

Butchery, Peace-keeping,
Liberation, Occupation...

it's all just points of view.

Do you know how the army
liberates a village in Afghanistan?

Do you?

From a C-130 Gun-ship
at 30,000 feet.

Do you think they care, if a few
civilians get caught up in that mix?

We're not talking about Afghanistan.

Oh they can't?
Death is death.

You kill civilians
youâ€™re a murderer.

You kill enough of them
and youâ€™re a mass murderer.

If you target civilians,
I agree.

But if your objective,
is political...

and civilians get in the way, then the
result is regrettable it's preventable...

but it does not rise, to the
moral equivalents of murder.

That is bull-shit, if death
is death, murder is murder.

James, how many people do you think
die in this country every day? 6600.

The tragedy is not
that people die...

it's the pathetic circumstances
in which live.

Yeah, you know what,
I agreed to do this, because...

I thought that... huh, maybe I could...
huh, do some good, help people.

That's it for me, Gentlemen.
I know what I promised.

I didn't realize that caper
went through the cemetery.

Don't be melodramatic, Truman killed
65,000 people in Hiroshima, alone.

That was war.

And this isn't?

I don't wanna be remembered
as another Timothy Mc Veigh.

History judges on success.

If we accomplish our goals, we'll be
remember't as men of good conscience.

If we don't...

I don't give a fuck what people
think of me, ones I'm gone.

What about God?
God?

I think that God
understands violence.

"All the first-born in
the land of Egypt shall die...

from the first-born of the Pharaoh,
to the first-born of the Maid servants".

Yeah, those rules are made pretty clear,
"I shall not kill".

Well, you should read the bible
before you quote it...

It says: "He that smudged a man, so that
he dies, should surely be put to death".

"He who cursed his mother and
father should be put to death".

Now come on, have you
ever cursed your parents?

Never in words, just wicked.

What about politicians and presidents?

It don't mean, that I know Gods plan
for this country, but I'm sure...

it does not include clamping electrodes,
to the testicles of prisoners.

Two wrongs don't make it right.

It's an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, a wound for a wound.

A life for a life.
Jesus said, "Turn the other cheek".

Is that what they did,
after September 11?

You see James, we live in old
Testament times.

The people want
"Fire and Brimstone".

You people are wrong.

That's my point,
revenge is for the wicked.

We all know what God
does to the wicked.

He snubs them.

With the edge of the sword...

we shall not spare them,
neither have pity nor mercy.

Neither should we.

Do you believe that shit?

James... it's important
that you understand...

the things we're fighting for.

The things we're gonna win.

Why I see your lips moving,
but what I hear is Robert.

Are you James?
I hope not.

For your sake nothin' else.

You're up late.

You here to kill me?

What makes you think that?

I might call the police.
You're a rat?

No.

Then you have nothing to worry about.

It's cold down here.
Yeah.

Alright, so...

I do this, what I gotta... pull a
trigger, push a button or somethin'?

You park the truck,
we pick you up.

We detonate by remote and the
3 of us, get the hell out of town.

The 3 of us?
Yeah.

Robert's staying behind.

What for?

Start over, recruiting
another cell.

So it goes and...

Extremism in defense for liberty,
is no vice, James.

Look, I need you to tell me,
that this is the only way.

That would change things?

Hm-mm?

One way,
to get inside peoples head.

This is how we cut through
all the static.

Like Oklahoma City.

No, the public wasn't ready then.

But they're ready now.
Hm-mm.

September 11th, opened our
minds to possibilities.

I ain't afraid to die.

And that's why we need you.

Hanna is not dumb.

Yeah.

I know.

Hey, wake up.

Something we gotta do.

What's going on?
We're making Video-tapes.

Of what?
Testimonials.

If anything goes wrong.

I'll have them released
to the media.

Seriously?

Well, if they try
to dehumanize us...

I wanna make certain
our message gets out.

Where you want this?

Huh, right here.

Well, I don't know what to say.

Just speak from the heart.

It's all set.

Alright?

Our country was founded
on the principles...

that all men are created
with equal rights...

and obligations to defend
themselves from tyranny.

But with out consent to be governed,
there can be no government.

There is no higher authority,
than our own good judgment...

and common sense.

And this consent is the privilege
of every citizen to give...

and their inalienable
right to take away.

Not just every 4 years, but...

whenever oppression
threatens liberty.

The cost of Freedom
has always been high...

and Americans have always paid it.

With our bounty, with our blood.

But what have we been ask to sacrifice,
in this new global war on terror?

Freedom itself.

The world changed on September 11,
3000 Americans died.

What did their lifeâ€™s purchase?

A Military debacle in the Middle-east.

A Nation cynically divided,
for political gain...

and a Constitution, that has been
systematically undermined and perverted.

Is this how we honor our dead?

What was done once,
can be done again.

The world can change for a 2nd time.

Not backwards in to Empire.

But forward, in to Truth,
and Justice and Democracy.

That is my burden,
that is my crime.

That is my privilege.

I don't ask forgiveness...

but I demand that you
understand my reasons.

What we plan to do,
we do for those who died.

For those who live...

and for those of you,
who are about to die.

More tea?

Thank you.

You look good.

Retirement suits me.

I'm happy for you.
And for you.

The King is death.

So, long live the Queen.

Why did you leave, Robert?

We've been over this.

We all burn out.
Not all of us quit.

I guess, I reached that point.
Which point?

You can't wash the stink
off your hands.

I never pecked you for an Idealist.
Maybe once.

But now, I'm a full-time Historian,
I like the facts speak for themselves.

The book.
Did you read it?

I read the report on it.
And?

You're out of the game now, right?

That's right.

So, why do you care,
how thick your file is?

At least somebody bought a copy.

They say writing is
a lonely profession.

I got many people around me.

Other writers?
Friends.

You entertain?
I try to stay involved.

The lectures, meetings,
and so forth.

You should stop by sometime.

We're friends, aren't we, Robert?
I like to think so.

If you saw a friend...

heading for trouble, you have to
do something about, wouldn't you?

Yeah, it's an obligation.

I'm gonna ask you something...

and I want you to think carefully,
before you answer.

Of course.

Are you involved in anything,
we should know about?

No.

No, you're not involved in anything?...

Or no, we shouldnâ€™t know about it?

Please, you should phrase
your questions more careful.

There are limits, Robert.
You're right...

there are limits!
There are limits...

to what people can do,
or can be allowed to do.

Before their actions,
demand a reaction.

A preemption by force, or by
whatever means necessary...

to draw the lines,
which can not be crossed...

and there are injustices, which
must not be allowed to stand.

So long as we understand each other.

How do you know
that's the right wire?

Circuits.

Really? And how you know
it's the right circuit?

That's why Robert,
pays me a big bonus.

But what, if it doesn't work?

There's only one way to find out.

Oh, no, no, thanks.
Watch how it's done.

Alright, what'd I do?

That's programmable, one number
lights the fuse, another shuts it off.

What's the number to detonate?

1776.
Cute.

Go ahead.

What, that's it?

Well, you have to imagine it wired
to a 1000 pounds of explosives.

Well, then how do you test it?
You don't test it...

you just have to trust it's
gonna work out the 1st time.

What if there's no signal?

It can always be
detonated manually.

Then that extra man,
has to flip the switch.

Well, it's better
than getting caught.

They fly you over the ocean and
then drop you out of the plane.

Why waist a cell at Guantanamo.

So, who's gonna drive?
We need a patsy.

Just like with Oswald,
but that's obvious.

So, how do you find
some one like that?

Actually Hanna, that's your job.

You're the Honey-pot.

Ah... what does that mean?

You know the C.I.A. Play,
you catch a bear with honey.

Yeah, I know what a Honey-pot is.

And where exactly am I
supposed to find this guy?

Take as much time as you need.
You mean, you want me to fuck'm?

All of us have made sacrifices,
to reach this point.

Now what is one more,
when the end is so near?

So, what'd you think?

It's... huh, I like it.

Well no, I mean my friends.

Yeah... huh, they seem nice.
Yeah?

Robert has a lot of ideas.

Well, I gotta be honest,
all that political stuff...

just goes right over my head.

You know, sometimes
the truth can be...

overwhelming sometimes and...

but also illuminating.

You know? It works for me.

You know?

You know, as long as
we're being honest, in here...

I just wanna tell you,
I think that you're...

incredibly sexy.

Isn't it kindâ€™ a rare, you're
living here with those 2 guys?

No, I'm not sleeping with them,
if that's what you worried about.

No, but it's just so...
So...

Intense.
Is that a problem for you?

What?
Intensity.

No, ma'am.
Oh, well, that's a good boy.

Yeah, let's go over it again.

I got it, alright?

Assure me.

The truck's gonna fuel,
and I leave at 8:00am sharp.

Marcus and Hanna
gonna follow behind...

take the Blvd. to the
Express-way and then Down-town.

How many exits?
5 exits...

take a left off the ramp, 3 lights,
then take a right on 12th street.

Target's a half mile
down on the right.

And what happens
when you get there?

I'm the water guy, nobody
looks twice at the water guy.

But if they do?
I smile and pull in anyway.

I'll be waiting,
to pick you up.

Hey, what's so special
about this building anyway?

It's the target.
Yeah, I know it is.

But... huh, what's so special about
it, that y'all risk our lifeâ€™s?

Secrets.

Secrets? That's it,
that's all you gonna say?

Secrets, that need to be buried.

Is that a problem?

No, ma'am.
How should I approach'em?

There's a... weak link.

She's their Honey-pot.

I never thought of myself,
as the honey type.

You'll do.

The key is not to show to much,
let them underestimate you.

An old country boy like me.
Cut the corn, Paul.

Sorry.

You fuck this up and
people are gonna die.

Yes, ma'am.

Let Robert, rail against the
Iniquities of the world...

let him march, you're job
is to keep him save.

From himself?
From his good intentions.

And from us, we owe him that much.

And if he decides to go ahead?

We burn that bridge,
when we come to it.

What's wrong?

It don't feel right,
to celebrate.

It's the turning point,
in the History of our country.

Yeah, I... huh, can't shake the idea,
that we're the bad guys, of sorts.

Oh, come on, you really feel that way?

Alright, then let us tell
you a story, about bad guys.

How many hours did the
High-jackers have?

The 9/11 High-jackers?
Yeah, how many flight hours...

did they have as pilots,
in those types of Jets?

I have no idea.
Guess.

A few.
None.

And yet each of their
targets were shot.

They got lucky.
Very lucky.

Now, flight 77 was flown
by Hani Hanjour.

Hanjour had tried to rent a Cessna
a month before the attacks...

but he had such difficulty landing, the
flight school refused to let him fly solo.

But ever since the F.B.I.
said he had been practicing.

The section of the Pentagon that
Hanjour crashed his plane into...

was under construction.

They were having constructing
surviving a missile attack.

because the terrorist crashed
into the one part of the building...

that was specifically designed
to withstand the impact.

And the Top-Brass...
were sitting on the other side.

What if the High-jackers was
getting set for the generals.

James, that's a lotâ€™ a luck.

Maybe that was about the
closest to dive back.

You might think so,
but... in fact...

the plane had to
veer miles of course...

and circle around, to strike
the Pentagon from behind.

Okay, now Imagine this...
at 500 miles an hour...

Hanjour... executes
a 270 degree turn...

dropping the plane
7000 feet in 2 minutes...

and then at 30 feet above
the ground, he levels off...

and slams in to the Pentagon
with pin-point accuracy.

And this from a guy,
who couldn't land a Cessna?

What's your point?

James, if you add up all the people
in the planes, in the towers...

in the Pentagon, how many people
do you think that is?

Thousands.
Ninety thousand.

And how many people, do you
think died in the attacks?

Two thousand, nine hundred,
eighty-six.

So, the remarkable thing about 9/11,
is not how many people died...

but how many lived.

What you're saying, these pilots
purposefully crashed this planes...

in such ways, to minimize
casualties, I'm not buying.

Of course now, if these
were radical Jihads'...

they would have never been entrusted
with such a delicate mission..

What'd you mean entrusted? By who?

Did you ever hear of the Project
the New American Century?

No.
It's a new conservative Think-tank.

<i>In Retrospect
the Neo-con Think-tank.</i>

Rumsfeld is a member...
Perle, Wolfowitz, Cheney.

In 2000, they published a plan,
for 100 years of American-agenda.

Of course,
they didn't have the money...

to pay for the necessary
military build up.

Absent as they planed to do...

some catastrophic
and catalyzing event...

like a new Pearl Harbor.

And a year later
they got there money.

So these guys staged 9/11.

Did they plan it?
Did they take advantage of it?

Is there a difference?

The Pentagon got their budget.

Republicans, are in government.
Corporations make billions.

This is all a vast crazy
conspiracy.

Why do conspiracies,
always have to be vast?

You see, if two people plan
a crime, that's a conspiracy.

Successful conspiracies are small.

The smaller the better.

Three, maybe four people.

I need a drink.

You want one?
Sure.

Should you?

Does it make sense to you?
This theory?

Does it matter?

It does if you're using it to justify,
what we're about to do tomorrow.

I'm not trying to justify anything.

Well, people are gonna die.
It's important...

that their sacrifice has meaning.
Even if you have to make that meaning up?

People need stories to make
sense of their lives.

The truth is less important,
than the effect.

So you're gonna see project, guys
you wanted 9/11 to happen...

we were still attacked
by Al-Qaeda, right?

To the extent that Al-Qaeda
actually exists, that's correct.

So they hit us and we
hit'm back, keeps going.

That's not quiet that simple.

Why do you think the attacks
occurred, on that particular day?

Why September 11?
And don't think of the sky was clear...

because the High-jackers bought
their tickets weeks before that.

I don't know.

Okay, it turns out
that on September 11...

NORAD was conducted an exercise
called "Vigilant Guardian".

Which simulated air attacks,
against the United States.

Now, what they did, or have
the ability to do, was to plant...

false transponder signals, into
the air traffic control system...

which appeared as planes
veering off course.

And in fact, there were
something like, huh...

29 false High-jackings
reported that day.

Supposedly, once the Air-force
got their birds off the ground...

nobody knew where to send them.
How did the High-jackers know?

The question isn't who knew.
The question is, who needed to know.

From Al-Qaedaâ€™s point of view...

they only needed one person
to give the order.

Osama bin Laden.

And all he needed to know,
was the date.

Then who told Osama?

That could've been anyone.

And don't forget, that was
C.I.A.'s go to guy.

A Saudi royalty,
and someone else picked him.

You know what a U.A.V. is?
An unmanned aerial vehicle?

A plain you fly by remote control.

Exactly,
now there is a defense plant...

called
"System Planning Operation"...

they make remote controllers, for
U.A.V.'s, for missiles, for boats...

and even for commercial air liners.

Now, they're not the only
company to do this...

but their C.E.O. was comptroller,
at the Department of Defense.

He was also a member of the...

Project the New American Century.

And it gets better,
under his less then watchful eye...

<i>a trillion dollars,
was misplaced by the Pentagon.</i>

He resigned,
but the money was gone.

That's just an accusation.

We're not accusing him of anything.

No! And we're not saying,
that 9/11 was a setup.

Or Pearl Harbor, or J.F.K.
The point is...

that if anybody wanted to do such
a thing, at a very high level...

it wouldn't be that hard.

You need to ignore the F.B.I.
reports on terrorist activity...

you need a way,
to contact Bin Laden...

you need a way to control
the planes and not the pilots...

and you need the money,
to finance the operation.

There's someone at the top,
someone who writes the checks...

a technician to install
the system to fly the planes.

It's all speculation,
I mean, you have no evidence.

James, what's it gonna take?
Proof.

There isn't any, there isn't gonna be,
this here will be beyond that.

There is three elements here,
motive, means and opportunity

What is their motive?

A hundred years of American empire.
Were there means?

A trillion dollars worth.

Was there opportunity?

The Air Defense Command, had
it's pants around it's ankles...

conducting a trill.

Maybe it's all bull-shit.

Maybe the government
planted this story...

to discredit the truth, hm'mm?

Maybe if... if you all look
closely enough, at any tragedy...

you find a whole string of events...

so random, that it's easier to
believe in some kindâ€™ a master plan...

then to except the fact,
that the world is complicated...

and that's the way shit
works out sometimes.

Maybe that's the definition
of "tragedy".

And maybe you're looking
for a reason to back out.

You know what, Robert?

It's not yet over with.

Maybe you should go to him.
And what?

Well, you're a smart girl,
you'll think of something.

Go on.

HACE 9 MESES

Did they teach you
this in the army too?

Special Forces.

They gave you a medal.

Yeah, that's my special talent.
Dick-less wonder.

Auh...

Ah, you're hurting me.

But you drew blood.
Oh'oh...

Self pity is not
a charm for quality.

Bitch.
Gimp.

I'll bite.
I'll do worse.

I love you.

No you don't.

I want a child.

I wanna have a child.

What?
So have one.

I want one with you.

You know that's not possible.

Well, we can adopt.

No.

You keep saying that.
I keep meaning it.

What's so wrong with it?

Just because a man is
your biological father...

doesn't stop him from
crawling into your bed.

That's disgusting.
It's true.

So, you wanna be a revolutionary,
you wanna bring down the system...

how you gonna do that, with
a baby hanging from your hip?

I don't know,
maybe get a sitter.

Come on.

What is this about?

I just wanna leave something behind.

An insurance policy.
Against what?

I don't know, living?

When you're dead,
who cares what happens next.

What?

Maybe you're not this great
father material, after all.

That's the first sensibly
thing you've said all night.

Did Robert send you up here?

Make sure I'm still committed.

Are you?

After all we've been through,
you ask me a question like that?

What have we been through, James?

You're asking me to kill
innocent people.

Everyone's guilty of something.

What're you guilty off?

Jacking you meaningless.

I knew what I was getting into.

I was teasing you.

You don't think I knew that?

Robert might be smart,
but it doesnâ€™t make me stupid.

You didn't think manageable.

By you?
You and me.

Sometimes I think
about taking a gun...

and ending this.
Yeah.

I know what you mean.

But then I think about the baby.

I was talking about Robert.

Let's get outta here.

Raise our baby.
In what kind of world?

I'm not having this arguments.
And I'm not leaving.

But you can, I can drive a truck,
the same as any man.

No.
Why not?

I wont let you.

All you've done, is look
for reasons not to do this.

You think I haven't noticed.

You think, Robert hasn't noticed?

If you're so opposed, leave.
I can't.

No one's holding
a gun to your head.

Oh... Hanna, you don't know
anything about me.

You're right.

So, what makes you think,
I can even pull this off?

Because... I picked you.

And deep down,
I know you're a good person.

If I drive that truck...

that makes me a good person.

It makes you a man of principle...

willing to sacrifice the lives
of others for the future.

You want me to do this
for the children?

You do it for yourself,
because you know it's right.

It's "Terrible", "Awful"...
but absolutely 100% necessary.

What about Marcus?
What about him?

You two are pretty close.

He's like a brother to me.

A brother you fucked.

He can't, you know that.

There's lots a ways to fuck.

Is that what this it about?

There was something once,
but that's all over now.

Because you can't love
a man without a dick?

Because he can't love himself,
not alone another person.

Do you still
have feelings for him?

I don't love him,
if that's what you wanna know.

Did you?
Once, maybe?

But none of that matters now.

Because my Knight walked into
a bar and rescued me.

My Damsel.
I never said "Damsel".

I said was in distress.

So then, what'd you gonna do?

Now once you're in call Hanna,
to confirm the signal.

Then head for the back exit...

we'll pick you up
at Debby's by the mall.

Now, if you can't get a signal,
you have to arm it manually.

You got 3 minutes,
to clear the Zone.

Anything else?
Good luck.

I'll see you on the other side.
Yes you will.

Alright, let's do this.

I'll wait for your call.

Are you alright?

Yeah... I will be soon.

What's up with that?
What?

What is he doing?
Is he turning?

I can't get a ring.
There must be a disconn...

No, can't be, let's keep going.
Are you serious?

It's goin' to shit, I can feel it.
Hanna! Don't freak out on me.

Please, let's just get outta here,
just the two of us.

We just can't leave the driver
and the (?) on it's own.

Listen, there's probably
something wrong with the truck.

It's the only way
he cold do.

Let's check it.

Hello?

What's going on, Robert?

Did I come at a bad time?
What you're doing here?

You invited me.

You're crazy.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

You're paranoid, you know that.
Delusional.

Your phone.

You're clean.
What did you expect?

I worry about you, Robert.

You quit your job, you live
like a recluse, and now this?

I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What you're doing here?

I came to make you an offer.
Come back to us.

To what?
What ever you want.

Five million dollars?
Lots of money?

For an island, so what?

Atlantic or Pacific?
Second half.

I know.

There's something you should
know about your driver.

What driver?
Of your truck.

What truck?
About James.

He's one of my boys,
he's one of us.

I can proof it.

Call him.

<i>- James, here.
They have a driver?</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Then it's over.</i>

I can salvage this.

<i>I've made my decision.
Be ready.</i>

What were you doing in there?

I was splashing water on my face.
Really?

I though I... huh, heard you
talking to someone, no?

No, there's nobody in here,
to talk to.

I thought, I... huh,
I heard something.

Yeah, you cut me, I talk to
myself in the mirror sometime.

Really?
Yeah.

Then what'd... huh,
you talk about?

Ah... you know, the usual,
bombs and girls.

So, there's something new
every day then.

It's when my boy-friend is crazy.
And you're not?

I... I mean, I suspected.

I didn't mean to be
discussing this, but, huh...

The man in the mirror.
Yeah.

Definitely.

You know it should tell you?

I can't take nothing
for granted...

because you never know
what's around the corner.

Robert send me up here, 'cause
he's got the maps ready.

Make sure you remember
the last thing I said.

Yes, that life is short, and not
to take anything for granted.

It's time for us to go downstairs
and you'll get the route.

James here.

<i>James? Hello?</i>

Hello?

James?

James?

Alright.

Where the fuck is he?

No, no, no! Marcus, don't leave me!
Please, don't.

Calm down, look... look at me.

Relax.

Subject one is down.

Anna freeze! Get on the ground!
Marcus!

Freeze, damn it! No! No!

No! No! Stand down!

Don't be stupid, Hanna!
Fuck you!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Nobody here's gonna hurt you.

Come on! Hey, it's over.

I trusted you.

We have a shot.

You can't let it end this way.
No!

How is it gonna end?
With you alive.

With our baby alive.
Our baby?

I let you fuck me.
I was doing my job.

Did you like it?

Did you like fucking me over?
You were doing your job too.

They're gonna kill him?

You think, I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

They were going to kill you.

As soon as you called today.
I can still kill you.

Is this what you want?

We meant something to each other,
I know we did.

Hey! Hey!... Hey! Hey! Hey!

You gonna tell me
it was all lies?

Hanna...

I love you.

Go! Fuck! Fuck!

Hey, what happens to her?

She takes a long voyage,
does it matter?

That's sick.

Yeah, that's natural.

That's what separates us, from when
we know when we do things wrong.

But we do it with anyone.

Precisely, you saved lifeâ€™s.
