â™ª <i>The American dream

Work hard, stay in school,
get a job, a house,

a wife, mortgage,
keep your head down.

You'll get a little tiny piece.

Be patient.

Eventually your
piece gets bigger.

â™ª <i>Dream on, dream on, dream on</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>The American dream

and say, "Shit, I want that.

Imma take it."

That right and wrong
shit they pound

into your head when
you're young?

It's meant to lull you to sleep.

While they sleep, I'm
gonna reach out and grab

every fucking thing
that ain't nailed down.

Imma build my own
American dream.

Imma take it from them
'cause I want it more.

'Cause I want everything.

90% of the time, if you act
like shit is cool, then it is.

For the other 10%, oh yeah,
we got something for that too.

Hmm, Russian?


What you think?


Wanna walk?

Get that money.

â™ª <i>You ain't hear that

Good girl, good girl, good girl.

Good boy.

Good boy.

Good boy.

Hello, Ant.

This must be your
friend, Mr. Cortex...

Carter, man.

Carter.

Nice dog.

What's his name?

His name's Drago.

Sit, Drago, sit.

That's four keys
never stepped on.

You like it, Drago?

You like it... is good?

Oh yeah, Drago likes.

Good enough for Drago
is good enough for me.

Sit down, relax, have lap dance.

Give them lap dance.

Give it to him.

You fucking serious?

Fuck it, I like pink.

Gonna throw it at me like that?

Yeah, girl, you like
my situation?

This 140?

It's 112.

I decided to pay
28 through keyhole.

We agreed on 35 though.

I changed deals.


Whoa, whoa, whoa.

You're the stripper, not me...
the fuck is you doing?

What do you think,
I just fall off apple tree?

She checked for wire.

I'm gonna remember this.

Good, do that, remember it.

Someone is coming.

drop your weapons!

FBI, drop your weapons!

You're looking to fuck me, Ant?

What do you think I am, clown
with red nose and curly hair?

time, drop your weapons!

Who wants to fuck Anatoly,
who wants to fuck me?

I'm warning you, sir.

You want to fuck me,
you want to fuck me?

Do you want to fuck me?

You fuck me?

Drago! [GUNSHOT FIRING]

[GUNSHOTS FIRING]

This way!

Don't move!

[RADIO CHATTER]

I'm bleeding all
over this bitch, yo.

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

Fuck.

Yo Wally, you dumb
stuttering motherfucker.

<i>Pick the fucking phone up
or I'll tell your wife</i>

<i>about them fucking...</i>

Hello?

Yo, I'm coming over.

Ant?

Yo, you got a first aid kit?

Look, now's not
a really good time.

Make some fucking
coffee too, man.

You all right?

You call me a bitch
if I say it hurt?

You got shot in your
shoulder, nigga.

What do you expect?

Bitch.


Redecorated.

Wally?

Shh, shh.

Nigga, you shh.

You make that coffee?

You all right?
Yeah.

I told my daughter not to...

Kitchen looks good, Wally.


It was for my birthday.

So what happened?


Shit went bad.

Could have been worse.

I need you to find
out who set us up.

Ant, I'm not your
lawyer anymore.

Asking those kinds of questions,

it puts me in
a difficult position.

Look, you gonna be in a lot
of difficult positions

if you don't make that call.

I'm the assistant
district attorney now.

I can't be calling in favors

on behalf of a couple
of criminals.

Couple of what?

Good, good friends.


I don't say shit
like this a lot.

I need your help.

All right, give me a minute.

I'll see what I can find out.

Ah, shit, nigga.

Keep your voice down.

Fuck you, I just got shot.

You keep your voice down.

Well?

Well, they weren't
looking for you.

The Russians were
importing their dancers

into the country illegally.

Human trafficking.

You just picked the wrong
night to do a deal.

Cool, so we good.

No, you are definitely
not, uh, good.

Would you put that money away?

My wife and kid are upstairs.

Thank you.

They've subpoenaed
the security footage,

but they haven't gotten it yet.

I don't know if they'll ID
you from the tapes or not.

We have a small window here.

My advice?

Disappear.

Until we know more.

Nah, we ain't running.

This is going to
go federal, Ant,

and when it does,
there's nothing more

I can do for you.

Please, leave town...
I mean, a clean break.

No phones, no dealing,
no flashing cash

all over the place.

Go legit for a few months.

The Feds have resources we don't

and they'll have their ears up

for anyone making
noise anywhere.

Cool.

Chill on a hundred grand
for a couple months.

No, no.

You don't even know if
those bills are marked.

Look, man, it took
me a long time

to get my business
to where it is.

Now you're telling me
to just walk away.

Ant.

When I first met you,
what did you have?

What did I have?

Please, listen to me.

Your business
isn't worth anything

if you're behind bars.

Maybe you have family somewhere,

someone you can stay with?

I got cousins in Miami.

Okay.

Miami.

Sunshine State.


My car?

Yes.

[MAN SINGING IN SPANISH]

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]


Come on.

Ah, hell yeah.

Ten, pay me.

Come on, man, pay me.

Fuck that.

Damn, motherfucker, you lost.

Big Krispy Kreme
neck motherfucker.

Cheap ass bastard.
How do you know?

You can't even see
from over there.

Ain't nobody got to even
look at you to know you lost.

We know how you play and
you better quit looking at me

like that, too, you grease
neck motherfucker.

Pick up them dominoes, man.

Nigga, I ain't picking up shit.

What?

Nigga, I will straight
rape you, man,

you needle dick cloud
of smoke motherfucker.

You know I ain't been
out the joint that long

and I ain't got that shit out
my system yet... you heard?

Only reason I'm picking up,
nigga, is because I'm high.

'Cause if I wasn't, oh, oh...

I would kung fu karate
kick the shit out...

Yah!

Get the fuck out of here, nigga.

Get the fucking dominoes.

Flaco!

Who the fuck is you?

Hey, that's my cousin, bro.

What up, cuzzo?



Aw, shit.
Man, what happened to you?

Got shot.

This my nigga, Ant.

Oh, hey man, what it do?

What up?

Damn.

When you get married?


Here, grab all your
stuff out the car,

come on in the house.

Nah, that's all we
got right here.

Oh, you definitely got to
tell me about this shit.

This right here, this Sweets.

This my man, Petey.

And this big nigga
right here, this Crisco.

Why they call you Crisco?

Hey, this nigga be in and
out of prison so much,

that's a question you probably

don't want to know
the answer to.

What up?

What you doing, man?

Yo, you ain't got
to worry about that.

This my cousin.

Man, I can't trust nobody.

But you.

Shit, if I find out
these bills ain't marked,

I'll buy 'em a new bed.

Shit, I'll buy them
a new bedroom.

You need to relax, man.

I need to relax.

I need to relax?

You got a slug in your
motherfucking arm.

I'm sleeping on
a motherfucking couch.

We just drove here 1500
motherfucking miles in

a station wagon and now running

with some nigga named Crisco.

No, you fucking relax.

mad at me now?

Not at you, man.

Never at you.

Damn, I feel like I'm balling.

This shit remind me of back in
the day when I was hustling.

Enjoy yourself, nigga.

it's good to have you here, Cuz.

Shit, both of y'all.

Hell, my life.

Same shit every day.

Wake up, go to work, come
back to this little house.

It's good to have
y'all here, for real.

You know, we just gotta
lay low for a while.

Could be a minute.

Aw, man, no, don't need
to worry about that, man.

Shit, stay as long as you want.

Hell, if y'all start
getting restless,

y'all can just go
to work with me.

What you do?

Credit card processing.

This nigga probably swiping
Visas at Burger King.

No, man, look.

I work for a processing bank.

Businesses, they get charged
a percentage and a fee every

time they swipe somebody
credit card, right?

If they use our terminals,
then we get the basis points.

It's like tiny pieces
of the penny.

You know what I'm saying?

Then we send them a statement
at the end of the month

with every transaction.

Sounds boring as fuck.

Yeah, it's boring as fuck.

Shit, nigga, I'll pass.

Shit, well, what about you, Ant?

You want a job?

Want to make some money
while you're here?

Fuck it.

Wait, you serious?
Fuck it.

Well, shit, you
start tomorrow then.

I'm gonna show you a little
bit of the straight life,

my brother.

Who knows?

One day, all this shit
could be yours.

So, sir, if you
switch to our services,

I'm sure we could
save you at least...

9% over your current provider.

sorry, I really wasn't listening.

Oh, no, I was saying
that all of our rates

are so much lower than
all our competitors.

that's really awesome.

So you want me to give
you our bank statement.

With all of our customers'
credit card information?

Well, you know, I think we're
pretty much set right now.

Yeah, that is so cute, isn't it?

So we're gonna put it
right back here, okay?

Thank you so much for
coming into the store.

Have a good day.

9%, huh?

Well, Mr...

Flaco.

Mr. Flaco and Mr...

Oh, my bad.

Ant, Ant.

Well, Mr. Ant Ant, I've
never had a presentation

by a man of your stature.

No offense.

Your numbers are good
and I'm intrigued,

so it's a good start.

Great.

No, no, no, not so fast 'cause

there's one little problem.

What the fuck is the problem?

Pardon me.

How can I address your concerns?

Well, you see, Mr. Ant Ant,

I've been in this business
a long, long time.

When I started, I had nothing,

so believe me when I tell you

when a man come through my door,

I don't care what he look like,

I don't care how he talk,

I don't care where he come from.

If I see something in
a man that I can trust,

then we can do business.

Huh, 'cause business
just business, right?

When a man come in my door
and his watch cost more

than my whole bottom
line for a month,

well, then I don't know
if I can trust him.

You understand?

I tell you what I'm gonna do.

I'm going to give you
my statements and I want

you to come back in a couple
of days with a full breakdown,

all the numbers,
on paper, summarized

and then we see if we
can do some business.

All right?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I had to sneeze.

Go, fat ass.

Hold the fuck up, man.

What up, Cuzzo?


Hey, I'm so proud of your boy.

You should have seen him today.

I think he made his
first sale day one.

Hmm.

Hey, where your chain at?

You done went corporate.

Dancing for nickels.

Yeah, well, at least he working.

Maybe you should try
that sometime.

I hate that fucking ride.

Hey, yo come on Ant, let's go
work on this summary, man.

Show you how to get
this paperwork down.

Yo, get rid of that shit.

All right.

My cousin owns a scrap yard

and I'm driving for him.

We'll go in a minute.

Deal me in this time.

to have me working for him.

Too excited.

But hey, I didn't have
anything else to do.

So I kept working.

Most sales pitches
went the same way.

We asked if they are happy
with their service, tell 'em

we can beat their rates and
offer to draw up a summary.

But the one thing I couldn't
understand is these businesses

would give us their statements
to draw up the summary and they

had every credit
card transaction

that the business
did that month.

Every credit card name,
every credit card number.

And all that money, before it
went to vendors or MasterCard

or Visa or whatever, it went
through Flaco's bank.

Our bank.

Oh, I definitely do.

But I got my own paper,
I don't need yours.

But you know what?

When I saw you in here tonight,

I knew you was a king.

Coming up in here
like this is all yours,

like you want to own the world.

Like the world is yours and you

gonna have everything in it.

I like that.

But you know what, your friends?

He is gone.

You know, me and
my nigga Carter,

we been looking out for
each other for a while now.

He can hold his own.

Yeah, but the other boys?

The ones that
look like they ain't

never been out the hood?

Maybe they never had the chance.


It's about what
you do with them.

Some people just ain't hungry.

What about you?

What about me?
You saw me with them.

You came after me.


It's 'cause you're different.

You brought them there.

Gave them something

that they wouldn't
have without you.

Something they probably
couldn't handle without you.

The world is yours, Ant.

And you might as well just
go ahead and take it.

You sure you're not
ready to leave?

What about your friend?

What about her...
she's a big girl.

I'm pretty sure she
can handle that.

Here, come here, let me show you

how a king should be treated.

Excuse me, excuse me, hey, hey.

Are you finished talking
with my man right here?

You trying to get the
other side fucked up?

Shit ready for Halloween.

All right.

Get your own, son.

I could have sworn
I seen her looking at me.

Is that what you saw?

it's like food to me.

And when you don't eat
in a couple weeks,

it don't take much.

Just the smell of food and
you can't stop yourself.

You want everything in sight.

â™ª <i>Living the fast life</i> â™ª

they wish they could go back,

start over now that
they're grown,

knowing what they know now.

But I never understood
it till now.

This wasn't our city,
so we started slow.

Slow enough to get the word
out and get us known.

Throwing scraps in the water to
see what size fish come around.

It didn't take long for the
first shark to come around.

Duke was a small time
hustler from Mendocino

with eyes bigger
than his wallet.

He linked us in with a network
of commercially-licensed

growers from California.

I mean, an army of white
boys, all growing the finest

engineered strains of piff,

right under the
government's nose.

Carter and I never
seen anything like it.

I mean, it's damn near perfect.

They sold legally to medicinal
dispensaries under Prop 215.

By over reporting their
sales just a little,

between all of them, they
could skim hundreds of kilos

and legally grown and shipped
them east to sell them for more

than anything we could
get from the city.

Before long, the money
flooded in, tsunami style.

You all right, nigga?

I should karate chop your ass

into a motherfucking
diet, nigga.

Yah!


Damn, nigga, quit.

I ain't never smoked no
shit like this before.

I don't even feel
like I'm breathing.

Am I breathing, man?
Yeah, you're breathing.

Your stomach moving, nigga,

you breathing, motherfucker.

Mmm.

Shit, man, I'm fucking dying.

I'm dying from fucking
weed poisoning.

Nigga, you can't OD off
of no motherfucking weed.

but not no weed, nigga.

Yo, man, stop playing.

Flaco's gonna be back
here in a minute.

Petey, clean up the
rest of that weed, man.

How you gonna be
running shit out of

this nigga's house and
he don't know, son?


He'll know when he need to know.

And when is that, nigga?

Now's good.

Oh shit.

Flaco, what up, man?

Yo, what the fuck is this?

How was work today?

Yo, Ant.

Yo Carter, what the fuck is this shit, man?
What up, cousin?

Yo, what the fuck are y'all
doing in my house, man?

Sit down.

No, not until you tell me what
the fuck all this shit is.

Sit down.

Didn't you tell
me the other night

this is the way
you want to live?

Yeah, but I was drunk, Ant.

I was fucking drunk.

I could fucking get robbed,
I could go to prison.

I could fucking lose every
fucking thing I have...

This is nothing.

No, this is my home.

Matter of fact, I invited
you into my home.

As a matter of fact,
all y'all get out.

Get your shit and get out.

Everybody get the fuck out.

Get out, man.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

Yo, yo, Flaco, I'm sorry
about that, man.

Wanna hit this?

Why don't you take this?

Maybe this will ease the pain

you're feeling right now.

I don't want your money.

Yes, you do.

Everybody wants my money.

But it's mine and
I'm giving it to you.

Now I'm going to pack
all of this shit up

and I'm gonna get
it out your house

and I ain't gonna
deal piff no more.

What?

What?

You see this?

This from Mendocino, California.

Grown legally, legit.

Now the growers, they take
a little bit off each batch.

Not enough to be worth anything,

not enough to get noticed.

Pennies.

Understood?

It's a legitimate business

and the clients
don't know a thing.

Pennies.

Now you, you got access
to central banking records

and credit card accounts
for several of your clients

and your company?

They got access to thousands
more and all we want?

Pennies.

Wait, hold on, Ant.

Are you asking me to rob
my processing bank?

Yes.


Wow.

Look, I don't... Ant,
I don't know, man.

I don't even have access to
those accounts like that,

except when I'm at work.

And even then, all the
computers are monitored.

But then you got the clients

and the customers and the bank.

They might notice that, man.

If they do, yo, man,
that shit is crazy, man.

I don't even know how to do it.

Me neither.

But if you hungry, you
gonna find food, right?

I can't, man.

Oh well, thank you
for your hospitality

and we'll be in touch.

All right?

Come on, son.

Yo, what the fuck was that?

He ain't ready for all that.

But you are though, right?

And I am.

So something gotta give, nigga.

Fuck it.

Let's go get an apartment.

Not bad, not bad.

This'll work.

Nice little view.

What the fuck?

Door was open, man,

[PHONE RINGING]

Who this?

So is that flat screen
gonna be big enough for you?

Listen, why don't you

Come on, we out.

This crazy.

What the fuck was that?

What's up, what's up.

How you knew we was here?

Ya'll know where we

Don't matter.

Don't ask, don't tell, right?

You are funny.
It's Tyson's.

Yo, who the fuck is Tyson?

Relax.

It ain't like that.

You fucking Tyson too?

Are you serious?

No, I'm not fucking Tyson.

You know I'm a greedy
motherfucker.

I don't like sharing.

I do now.

This is our car.
Uh-huh.

I'm really gonna need
you to trust me.

We're gonna take you
on a special trip.

Where we going?

For a ride.

I ain't getting in the car.
Get in the car!

Cassie.

Damn.

Jackie, thank you.

You must be Carter.

Wait a minute, are you Tyson?

Jackie, maybe you'd like
to show Carter the pool.

Oh, I didn't mean no disrespect.

I thought Tyson was a nigga.

Jackie!

And you must be Ant.

There's no Tyson.

Is there?

Oh, there's thousands of them,

small and hard and with
a flick of a wrist,

they bring me money faster
than I ever thought possible.

And they can do the same
for you, don't you know?

So you been watching me.

No, not at first.

I watch your cousin because
sometimes I watch people

I think maybe I can use,
but Flaco is weak.

Weak mind and weak will.

But then I hear somebody
new come to town

and I start to watch you.

And you are strong.

Mmm.

So you sent Cassandra after me.

No.

No, Cassie is a big girl.

I don't send her after you.

She's strong herself.

Anyway, she think we
have similar interests.

Like what?

She says you're a hungry
man, like a lion.

I like a man with appetite.

What?

Maybe you don't understand me.

My father is Jamaican and
my mother's from Minnesota

and I was raised in the South.

So everybody say I talk
like a Muppet, you know?

But I want you to
come work for me.

Well uh...

Call me Mama Cash.

I really appreciate the offer.

Call me Mama Cash.

I work for myself.

Look, motherfucker,
you call me Mama Cash.

You're in my goddamn house,
you call me by my goddamn name.

Mama Cash!

Mama Cash!

Mama Cash!

Mama Cash!

Everything all right, Mama?

Yes, baby.

I wanted a cowboy.

And so I find him and I bring
him here and I show him a world

he didn't even know could
be real, you know,

and he does everything I say.

Not because he's scared of me
or because I pay him extra,

but because he loves me.

You know, true love,
gratitude and trust.

You know, that is power.

I want you to love me too.

I can show you what
Tysons can do for you.

I can show you what
we can do together.

I provide you with equipment
and Flaco will give us the bank

accounts and you provide me with
an operation that make us money

faster than you ever
thought possible.

Look, Flaco ain't going
for that, man.

Even if I agreed, he's scared.

Let Mama take care
of Flaco's fears.

What do you say?

Uh uh uh.

Here you are.

Good look.

And...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Ah.


Well what?

You tell me what happened
about last night or what?

We been putting in work
all these years

and you ain't never kept
me in the dark never.

I'm down for whatever.

I ain't mad.

Jackie worked a nigga
pretty good in that hot tub.

But we didn't go out there
for me to get my rocks off.

We partners, right?

What's the deal?

I don't know.

She was talking about Minnesota,

Jamaica and Muppets.

True love and shit.

True love?

She was trying to
kick it to you?

Nah, nigga, not like that, man.

She trying to do business,
you know, some serious money,

but I'm trying to figure out

if she's trying to
set us up or not.

Trust her?

That don't matter unless
we get Flaco to...

[PHONE RINGING]

Ant.

What up?

Word, what happened?

Then, I just realized
all the benefits.


<i>I'm happy to hear that.</i>

Yeah, that's good.

Real good.



What'd he say?

He in.

Get that money.


All right.

Flaco.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

That's all it means,
fucking money.

All right.

It's gonna be big, really big.
I'm happy.

What's up?
What's up, brother?

How you doing?
All right.

Check it out, you're
gonna love this.

Like I'm saying,
so check it out.

What I did was, I created
a protocol that runs in

tandem with our
tracing terminal.

Now, what that does is,

it shaves a ten-
thousandth percent

off each basis point
of every transaction.

And it adds an equal amount
to every transaction

before it's processed.

Now that is sent to one of
a hundred offshore accounts

with routing numbers
that cycle every hour.

Now the best part about
that shit, right here.

We move it before the
processing bank gets to it.

So when the numbers come
out on the statements,

the shit looks exactly how
it's supposed to look.

Now this shit works.

It passes Loan, it passes
Verhoff, it works with Java,

it works with Ruby,
it works with Gulfscript,

it works everything.

It works with all of that shit.

So, uh, what the fuck
does all that shit mean?

Get this to Flaco, man.

How do you know how to
do all this shit, man?

Shit, man.

Mendocino.

That's where I grew up.

In Mendocino, all you do
is fuck with computers,

smoke weed, or skate.

Which one do you think I did?

I look like I skate to you?


So why the fuck you ain't
in Silicon Valley

working for Bill Gates and shit?

'Cause the bitches out
here do not wear clothes.

Heard that!

This here from Mama.

Fucking serious?

You Rashid?

Yes.
I'm from the bank.

I came to service your
credit card terminals.

Terminal works fine.

Routine service update.

I got the new ones in the truck.

All right?

Be right back.

credit card terminals to install

in businesses under
Flaco's accounts.

The terminals was hacked.

They'd place a trace on each
card swiped and the terminals

could send us credit
card numbers

before they went
out to the banks.

All right, you're all set.

Um, think you could hook me
up with some of them Dutches?

No?

We're talking hundreds
of businesses

with hundreds of
transactions a day.

The terminals was hacked.

They'd place a trace on each
card swiped and the terminals

could send us
credit card numbers

before they went
out to the banks.

We're talking hundreds of
businesses with hundreds

of transactions a day.

Duke's program worked.

And it worked fast.

Oh shit.

Tiny pieces of pennies
adding up quicker

than any kilos of
piff ever could.

Hot coffee.

And just in case merchants
started asking questions,

credit card companies
started checking in,

I had the phone
company on payroll.

We installed a tap that
cross-referenced the businesses

and the bank phone numbers
to intercept any calls

related to the businesses
we were skimming from.

That's right, I can
verify the charges.

I can validate the charges.

Yes, that's right.

I can validate the charges.

So if anyone started snooping,

they'd reach out
and touch Sweets.

I can validate the charges.

It was genius.

Standby, I'll get you
the authorization code.

Did you tell them
about the dojo?

Did you tell them
about the dojo?

Uh-huh.
Tell them about the dojo.

Tell them.
Yeah.

That's free advertising.

You didn't tell them?

them about the goddamn dojo?

[ANT] You drunk.
No, no, no, not drunk.

Yes, you are.
No I'm not.

[ANT] You are drunk.
I feel good though.

Yo, Ant.

Gotta show you
something, my nigga.

Oh, hey Cass, how you doing?

I'm good.
Looking lovely as always.

Thank you.
What's up?

What you wanna show me?

Don't get mad.

All right?

Show, nigga.

Ladies.

Okay, what's this?

Uh, white bitches.

No, snow bunnies.

I'm not bitch.

What the fuck we supposed
to do with them?

Make a music video?

Ant, listen, we got
a lot of credit

and we gotta spend it.

This is how we do it.

I could do it myself, or Cass.

Listen, I barely got enough
time to spend the ones I got.

How's it gonna look if you or
I go into a department store,

flaunting somebody
else's credit card?

What they gonna think?

What would you think?

That you are criminal.

Exactly.

But if these bit...
bunnies walk into a place

flaunting somebody
else's credit card,

what would you think?

That they suck a mean dick.

They do.

I would think y'all
cutting my man in on this.

Huh?

Don't fuck her, Ant.

And don't fuck none
of these showcase

showdown bitches either.

I tell you, I'm not bitch.

Okay.

So what you think?

All right, let's do it.

To the white bitches.

[WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

All right, come on.

Carter, get her out of here.

Got it, all right, mama,
come on, let's go.

Follow the man, follow the man.

Okay, yeah.

It's gonna work, man, I'm

Strong, no filter.

This is like men I want

Strong.

No filter.

My apologies.

The coffee was good.

Look, with all due respect,

we didn't come here
to drink coffee.

No.

You come for, for business.

You come for my money.

Tell me.

What you give for my money?

We didn't ask for this meeting.

You asked to meet us.

Ah, this is good.

No filter.

Irina said we should meet.

We met.

If you don't want to tell us

what we're doing business about,

then I'll pay for the
coffee and we can go.

This is insult.

Look, you may be
known around here,

but we're not from around here.

I don't like my
time being wasted.

You are like angry dog.

Maybe stupid, maybe
dangerous, maybe useful.

Look, I ain't no man's dog.

Well, you're my dog.

You are a good team.

Good friends.

I think I trust.

Sit, sit, please, please.

Irina tells me you make credit
appear in other men's names?

Is real, not copy?

You can get more names?

You know, with enough
time, I can get you

as many credit
cards as you need.

I want 1,000.

That's a lot.

I pay, two million.

That's a lot.

Can you make happen?

Well, you know, to get
that many profiles

may take some time and uh,

that many cards gotta be
spread out over months.

I want one week.

This nigga bugging.


I want information,
I want people.

Can you do it?

There ain't nothing I can't do.
Word.

Then we have deal.

Yo, you snowflake bitch,
get the fuck over here.

I'll fucking kill you,
you punk-ass bitch!

I'll kill your ass!

What the fuck is wrong with you?


You, I'm gonna kill
you and that bitch.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Fuck you, man.

Hey.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

Really?

You know how we do, son.

Really?

I told you not to fuck her.

Yo, I swear to God, I ain't
fucked none of these bitches.

I told you not to fuck Mama.

Now you in a war and it's
a war you ain't gonna win.

Fuck.

Well, it ain't the first time

I heard that and I'm still here.

Goddamn it.

Don't make me choose
a losing side.

Telling you, this shit

Really?

Come on, man.

Yo, get the fuck up.

Get the fuck up.

Get the fuck out you
dumb white bitch.

Get the fuck out of here!

Ready for this?

What you think?

Two million.

Now I can get you the numbers.

It'll take 10 days,
but I can get them for you.

He said a week.

Nigga, two million.

Shit.

I didn't say yes.

You didn't have to.

Mirland's not a man
you can say no to.

Nigga, who you talking to?

All I'm saying is
you're not from here.

This man is crazy.

He's the head of the biggest
crime syndicate in Dade County.

He got eyes everywhere
and ears everywhere.

And soldiers everywhere.

This man is ruthless.

Well, uh, I ain't never
backed down from a fight.

Mm-hmm.

I used to do business
with a man,

a buddy of mine named Dino,
who worked for Mirland.

He had it in his head that, uh,

he could skim a little bit here,

fence a little bit there.

You know, just a little bit
off the top, nothing big.

So, this big job we had
and he figured, big job,

skim a little,
nobody will notice.

No big deal.

Mirland noticed.

So one day, I went to
meet my connect.

He wasn't there.

Mirland was.

He came himself.

He walked in my office with
four big boxes and he sat them

on my desk and he stared at
me until I opened them.


heart, his lungs and his balls.

What I'm saying is,
there's no big or small

with a man like Mirland.

It's just what he wants.

And if you say no to him,
he's gonna take it as disrespect

and he's gonna come hard at you.

You go hard at him he's
gonna come harder.

And again and again
and again till he gets

what he wants or
one of you is dead.


Yo, there's a big...

There's this big nigga,
this cowboy nigga, man.

I gotta stop smoking that shit.

The nigga in your shit, nigga!
What?

Get over there, man,
he in your shit, man.

Let's go there, nigga!

Yo, it's Ant.

Good to hear from
you, Mr. Mendino.

I've been awaiting your call.

Excuse me, I've
got to take this.

Where the fuck have you been?

Man, you told me to lay low.


Do you realize the chatter
coming through my office?

Whispers about a New York
crew working a fraud ring

with the Albanian syndicate?

What did I tell you
about foreigners, Ant?

<i>I told you, you stay away
from internationals.</i>

What do you know?

All I know is they're
watching a man named Mirland.

<i>Rumors about forging passports
all over Eastern Europe.</i>

<i>Please tell me
you're not involved.</i>

Ant, do you realize
the world we're living in?

Do you have any idea who they
could sell those passports to?

<i>We're not talking DEA anymore,
we're not even talking INS.</i>

Homeland Security
is watching this guy.

Look, get out.

<i>Get out, Ant.</i>

<i>There's nothing I can do
for you, I'm sorry.</i>

You can't ever call me again.

[GUNSHOTS FIRING]

[GUNSHOTS FIRING]

Let them through.

Let them through,

Mama's hearing bad things.

Yo, maybe you
listening too hard.

Mama got ears everywhere.

I hear everything.

You sleeping with the enemy.

Yeah, well, you'll
get your piece.

So that don't
really concern you.

Everything concerns me.

You listen to Mama Cash.

Mama told you no.

I ain't your dog.

Don't come to my fucking
house and tell me

how to do my business...

You work for Mama Cash, you do
what I say or I'll punish you.

Who the fuck are you talking to?
You!

Oh, you think I'm one of
your fucking cowboys.

Don't talk to me like that.

Don't talk to me like that.

You fucked up.

Maybe only you came

You have my names?

Where's Cass, man?

She's close.

But I don't lie.

I treat her rough.

You see?

I am a man of my word, even
when you try to back down,

I still bring you money.

I still do business.

Forget business, where's Cass?

I want to make sure she's safe.

she would be safe.

Give me names.

Maybe you don't bring?

Nah, we bring.


Tell your boys to
lower their guns.

Okay.

Take money and go.

Or stay, be shot.

No difference.

Fuck you.

I'm right when I say
you are like angry dog.

But not useful.

Stupid.

Okay, you stay... two dead men.

You have cowboy?

Like, real American western?
