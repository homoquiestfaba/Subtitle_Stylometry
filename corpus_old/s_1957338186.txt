[eerie music]

[phone rings]

[cell phone buzzes]

[Christina sobs]

Gio.

Come on, come on.


Baby.


Listen, listen, listen to me.

Come on, come on, come on.

[tense music]

[Gio cries]

[phone rings]

Come on, come on.

[tense music]

It's okay, baby.

It's okay, honey, it's okay.

[phone rings]

Pick up, pick up, pick up.

Listen to my voice, baby.

[Christina prays in Spanish]

It's okay, it's okay.

[car honks]

[dramatic music]

first time you were contacted

by this inspector?

A bout a year ago, I think?

I was at work when I got a call
from HR

asking why there was a man by
the name of Inspector Davis

attempting to confirm
my address of employment

so that he could serve me
judgment papers.

For the next four months,

he continued to call my
job, blow up my cell phone,

threaten to have me arrested.

He harassed my daughter
in Memphis, my ex-husband,

telling them that I was a
deadbeat.

I lost weight, I couldn't
eat, I couldn't sleep,

I almost lost my job.

All of this for a 10 year old
debt.

For $453 and 12 cents.

Your witness, Counselor.

Ms. Reynolds, out of
curiosity,

how did you trace this Inspector
Davis

as an employee of my client?

I Googled the number
that kept showing up

on my caller ID,

that led to a consumer's forum

where there were plenty of other
people

receiving similar calls.

I traced that to AMG
Receivables.

Do you have any real proof,
recordings of conversations?

Well, no.

Verified witness statements?

Was that a no?

No.

Surely your phone bill
will show proof of the calls.

Did you bring a copy of
that bill with you today?

I'm no longer with that phone
company.

didn't pay your bill.


Overruled!

few months behind, yes.

In fact, other than the phone
bill

and this medical debt in
question,

you've got quite a few
derogatory marks

on your credit for failure to
pay.

Isn't that correct?

Correct.

repossessions, an eviction,

four credit cards currently
120 days past due.

I've fallen on hard times.

So hard that you're now suing
my client

for thousands of dollars

for allegedly collecting on
a debt that you lawfully owe.

How is that any different from
extortion?

Objection!

Come on, Mike, please.


[dramatic music]

[tense music]

[men chattering]

dismissal,

what is that, four in a row,
Michael?

This one's a little
too close for comfort

thanks to Inspector Davis over
there.

Eat a bag of dicks.

Oh, I'm sorry, you must have
me confused

with your old cellmate.

[glass breaks]

What the fuck?

You motherfuckers need to start
taking this shit seriously.

There's no way you can
operate a business like this

on the defense.

Yeah, says the Jew.

I can't with this guy,
Brandon.

This guy is the driving
force behind AMG, Michael.

The type of paper we collect,

we're good at what we do

because we use alternative
methods of recovery.

Ever buying Saver Paper?

Where the fuck is the fun in
that?

Look, I'm just trying to
protect what you've built.

The reality is, the climate's
changed.

The FTC, CFPB, FCC,
they've all caught wind

of what's going on.

17 operations have gone
down in the past 6 months.

The number of FDCPA lawsuits
like this one

tripled last year.

It's a different animal.

Fine, I tried.

What is this?

It's porn.

Just that trainee shit that he's
into.

Close, it's actually my bill.

Your E&O declined the insurance
claim on this lawsuit,

now you have to pay me directly.

So, do you want to cut me a
check now,

or send me a wire-

Fucker.

All right.

Come on, come on.
Want me to cut you a check?

I'll cut you a fucking check
right now.

You piece of shit!

Come on, come on.

Get your fucking
wombat under control or-

Hey, go fuck yourself!

I mean it!

[cell phone rings]

In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

Sit down.

God.

Your blood pressure must be sky
high.

You take your pill today?


Here.

You remember in sophomore year

when you dropped like a
sack of shit, speech final?

Hm?

Well, fuckin' Tommy Slate's
mom

was the nurse that day.

Yeah, I was looking for an
excuse

to bask in those titties
for a few hours, you know?

[Brandon chuckles]

She did have a great pair of
tits.

Oh, God, did she.

Fake.

Stop!

You could never tell the
difference.

I mean, I was always more of
an ass man.

Mm.

Clearly you never discriminated.

Missy Novak?

Dude, I mean her chin looked
like

two fuckin' testicles

hanging from her lower lip.

Right?

[Brandon laughs]

She had a dick face, bro, you
know it.

Yeah, but great ass.

Great ass.

Dick face, bro.

[Brandon chuckles]

You think maybe the Jew could
be on to something here?


Paper quality.

I'm just saying, I think
that maybe we should

keep our options open here.

We got a stack of bullshit
lawsuits

sitting on your desk right now

that we gotta pay outta pocket
to defend.

So, maybe it can't hurt to
diversify

the portfolio a bit.

You're joking, right?

No.

Look, we buy some repo
packages from Chase Auto,

we collect on the deficiency
balance.

We run some hard pulls.

Hell, if that doesn't work,

we file an action to collect,
right?

It's all legit.

You know, we're good at what
we do.

Right?

That's what gives us seven
figure years.

And we're about to bet it all

on the biggest package
in receivables history,

so I need you focused.

Okay?

We push the envelope.

And then it's fuck you
money, per quarter, for life.

Fuck you money.

Fuck, Brandon.

That's what it's all
about, nothing else.

Fine, but I'm not
going back inside, bro.

I'm not gonna let it happen
again, okay?

Tonight is the start of
something

transcendent for our
company, and I need you.

You're my brother.

Mhm.

[buzzer sounds]


It's time.

[dramatic music]

Hey.

Watch it, puta.

[train honks]

Oh, hiya, how you doing?

I'm good.

Oh, it's so good to see you.

We haven't seen your wife
at the club for a while.

Yeah.

[tense music]

Um...

Well, it was nice to see you.

Thanks for all your years
of membership with us.

[tense music]

Ma, Dad.

I guess I didn't catch
you guys this morning.

Just figured there was some
kind of scheduling mix up.

Do you guys miss me?

I mean, hey, it's been
18 months with no visit.

Why don't we take this
conversation outside?

No, no, no, no, no, we can do
it here,

I mean, we're all
essentially family, right?

Come on outside, now.

No, here.

What the hell?

You've already destroyed the
family name.

Why not milk it?

I made a mistake, Dad.

You're a drug dealer, a felon.

What did you expect to
happen when you got out?

Sean's home, everybody!

Let's hit the links, party time.

Look at her.

Look what you did.

Your own mother.

All the Xanax and Klonopin in
the world

will never be able to fix this.

I'm so sorry, Mom.

We are well past the point of
apologies.

What's it gonna take?

I'll cut you a check, right
now, just to disappear.

And then what, we're done?

20 grand?

Are you buying me off?

30 then?

Mom!

Okay.

You want to talk numbers,
let's talk numbers.

How about 15?

The numbers of years that you
used

this disgrace of a son
to market Maas Jewelers

to your community,

placed some pictures
of my three consecutive

All-Valley MVP awards on your
storefront

to justify insane markups.

Huh?

$75,000.

Oh, that's a small price to
pay

to ostracize the same kid

that changed your colostomy
bag daily for weeks on end

after your prostate removal.

100,000.

How could we ever forget
that time when I was 14

and I read the eulogy at papa's
funeral

because you were too shit-faced
to get your act together

and be a rock for your own
family when we needed you most?

$500,000!

Done.

Stay the hell out of our lives,

you disgraceful piece of shit.

[dramatic music]

[tense music]

Mid six-figures from old man
Moss.

Fuck me.

I'm impressed.

You know, I played skins with
that cheap prick a few times.

There's a reason they
call him alligator arms,

you know what I'm saying?

Of course you know what I'm
saying,

you're his son, or were his son.

Here, take a look at this.

Get your act together and be
a rock for your whole family

when we needed you most!

$500,000!

What the fuck is this?

It's a job interview.

Yeah, okay, I'm a convicted
felon.

It's a pre-requisite in my
field.

Which is what exactly?

Collection.

Brandon.

Sean.

[dramatic music]

Are you coming?

Are you kidding?

It's not gonna drive itself.

Got anywhere better to be?

[tense music]

I'm heading out, I'll be back
later.

Love you, mama.

[tense music]

Who's the twink?

New blood.

back.

[dramatic music]

Well, if it ain't the fuckin'

bizarro Robin Hood in the flesh.

How's the receivables
business treatin' you?

Well, hopefully you're about
to tell me.

Accounts?

Over 40K.

Average per six figures worth of
debt.

Some tasty asset cows,

we're talking potentially nine
zeros.

And that's a shit ton of
deadbeats.

give it up for Svetlana!

Problem?

You're light.

Well, considering
the amount of bad paper

you sold us last month,

I'd say we're heavier
than your mom's period.

What the fuck did you just...

[man groans]

Tell the glory hole to relax.


Bad paper.

The majority.

Previously paid to another
agency,

or belonging to individuals
who have been deceased,

or filed for chapter 7.

If the packages are what
you say it is, then great,

we can resume business as usual.

It's legit.

I'll meet you outside.

You should probably ice those.

She's cute.

Excuse me.

Hey.

Um...

Oh, look, sorry, I don't

I have to take my son home.

Is that your real name,

Do I like Russian to you?

[dramatic music]

Hey, mijo.

Hey, mijo.

So, what is it, Halloween or
something?

My uniform.

What are you, a stripper?

Are you fuckin' kidding me?

You told me you had a cashier
job.

I did.

So between that and Edgar, you
can't-

Edgar hasn't been by
the past three months.

Did you try both his cells?

Disconnected.

I'll handle it.

I'll handle it.

How?

How exactly?

I have to get ahold of Edgar.

Did you not just hear me?

I'll figure it out, all right?

I'll find him.

Oh, from in here, huh?

With a sundial?

That's great.

In the meantime, my
phone's been blowing up

20 to 30 times a day from debt
collectors

because I can't pay our bills.

Hey, hey, you watch yourself.

These people are threatening
to sue me,

ruin my credit.

We've been evicted.

Then Uber or some shit
'til I figure it out.

With Gio in the car?

[man speaks in Spanish]

You promised you would take care
of us.

You promised.

Let's go.

[dramatic music]

[Ross whistles]

All right, everybody meet
Sean,

the fuckin' new guy.

There we go.

And don't let his white bread
bougie appearance deceive you.

He's a piece of castaway
trash just like all of us.

All right?

So let's treat the kid with
a little bit of respect, huh?

I.e. no tampon strings

hanging out of his herbal tea,
Juanita.

Man, that shit was an
accident, Rossy baby.

Well, that accident cost us
60K

and a workman's comp
settlement there, Aunt Jemima.

Don't make me get up out of
this chair,

I'll beat that ass.

Oh, you gonna beat that ass?

You mean eat that ass.

Maybe.

Can anybody guess what
this number represents?

The largest portfolio
in receivables history.

And as of late night, it belongs
to us.

[people clapping]

So, what does that mean?

Well, for starters, each and
every collector in this room

has the potential to clear
7 figures this quarter.

Think about that for a moment.

Think back to when most of you

were just getting out of
incarceration.

Turned down for job after job.

Competing with society for
opportunities

they were never gonna give you,

for less than minimum
fuckin' wage, by the way.

Look how far each and
every one of you have come

working at this company.

Now, the bad news is,

even pennies on the the dollar,

I had to beg, borrow, and steal

just to finance this package.

So I drained the operating
account and the reserves,

meaning no guaranteed salaries.

If anybody has an issue with
that,

there's the fuckin' door.

Let's get down to it then.

The portfolio is divided into
tiers.

Each represents a cluster of
accounts.

The bottom of the pyramid
consists of the low hanging fruit.

Primarily medical debts still
within

a 7 year credit reporting
window.

Easy to collect, but
obviously lower in value.

The row above that gets more
difficult.

The statute credit card
deficiencies.

And above that is zombie
debts 10 years or older,

and so on and so on and so on
and so on.

You get the picture, right?

Each collector keeps 10
points on money received.

What you'll notice is the
number of boxes at the bottom

correlates directly to the
amount of people in this room.

What you also notice is the
second column from the bottom

consists of one less box.

Can anybody explain to me the
reason why?

Lowest total in the first
round

doesn't make the cut for the
second.

Exactly.

Darwinism.

So, what happens to
the last man standing?

Person, sorry.

He or she will have the
privilege

of competing with Ross for
the top of the pyramid.

A mid 7 figure account.

Winner of that splits
50/50 with me on the take.

Any questions?

When do we start?

30 fuckin' minutes ago.

You're over here, rook.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Cupcake, you don't get a chair.

You're over here.

Right here in the corner.

You gotta be kidding.

Nope.

All right.

Don't fuck up.

[Sean chuckles]

Thanks.

Okay, Regina Becker, what you
got?


Yeah, hi, can I please speak
with Regina Becker, please?


This is Steve, from AMG
Receivables.

I'm calling about a $1,892 debt
you owe

to Roundtree Dermatology.


and I gave them my information.

Well, they said it wasn't
covered.

dime.

They almost burned my toe off

when they tried to freeze that
wart.

Albert, I really don't want to
see this

on your credit report,

so what if I can get the
hospital

to cut the bill in half, okay?


But that's not my problem.

you bloodsucking leech.

Okay, I'm listening.

My mother has been in
the hospital for 6 months.

She's got chronic gout.

I've got 3 kids to feed.

Are you even listening to me?


This is a work number.

Don't call here again, I know my
rights.

It's not about rights...

pay rent this month,

just not possible right now.

I could take a card over the
phone.

got no job right now,

I just can't do it.

I need a commitment from
you on this bill, sir.

I'm a female.

You just called me sir, ma'am.

Or I'm gonna have to mark your
file

as a refusal to pay.

I don't give a damn what you
do,

just don't call here anymore.

Hey!

Wait, wait, wait!

Hey, wait, wait!

Fuckin' shit!

Tu madre!

Pendejo!

Fucking shit!

Fuck!

I'm only 10 days behind,

and I spoke to somebody
over there last week

telling them that I'd be a
little late.

I've made arrangements to pay

and you still take my car?

No, I understand that
it's not the first time,

but look, I am trying,

I'm doing my best.

I just need my car back, okay?

Hello?

Fuck!

Come on.

[seductive dance music]

[cell phone rings]

Hey.

halfway through round one

you got Juanita at first, Gerald
second,

mixed bag for the rest.

What about the kid?


Kid seems broken.

Well, put Humpty Dumpty
back together, okay?

you give a donkey's twat?

Just do me the solid.

Trust me, the kid's got
potential.


Wait, hold on, are you at
Daddy's Angels

at one in the friggin'
afternoon?

Goodbye, Ross.


[Brandon coughs]

Excuse me.

Is Svetlana working today?


Ooh, mamacita.

Where the hell have you been,
Edgar?

Mexico City for a while, jump
and all.

So you can't call, shoot me a
text?

I had to ditch both burners.

Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

Judging from the looks of you,

I say you've been having muchas
fiestas.

[Edgar laughs]

This is funny to you?

Just relax.

What is this?

It's all I got.

Where's the rest of it?

Call it a finder's fee.

Wow.

When Mario finds out about this,
he's...

[tense music]


[Christina screams]

He's stuck in a cell for the
rest of his miserable life.

You think about that, huh?

Fuck that, new leadership now.

Consider yourself lucky I even
came back

to give you anything, you
ungrateful puta.

You really want more money, huh?

Maybe you and me can work out

another arrangement, huh?

Huh?

Yeah.

[dramatic music]

Baby.

Baby, please.

I'm out of Xanax.

You were supposed to get me a
refill.

You need help.

You wanna help me?

Get me my fucking meds.

Baby, you're sick.

You haven't left the house in
months.

Please, I need my wife.

Come on, when was the last time

that we went on a date night,
huh?

Oh, is that what this is
about, Bran?

Hm?

You wanna get laid?

Come on, honey.

You wanna get fuckin' laid?

Stop it.

Huh?




Let's fuck.

Huh?

Is that what you want?

You wanna fuck me, Brandon?

Is that what you fuckin' want?

Huh, Bran?

Is that what you fucking want?

You want to have another fucking
baby,

is that what you fucking want?

You want another fuckin' baby?

Huh?

So you can murder him too?

Is that what you want?

[Wife screams]

[dramatic music]

Wake the fuck up!

I've listened to most of the
tapes,

and you're well on your way

to being the first man out.

I don't know what the
hell Brandon sees in you,

but he's my boy.

Oh, yeah, Regina Becker.

First little cunt that exposed
you.

One shot deal here, cupcake.

Regina Becker.


Tom Ross with AMG Receivables.

Did I catch you at a bad time?

A bad time?

It's 7:30 on a Saturday morning,

plus I already disputed this
debt,

and I told you to stop calling
me.

I know my rights.

Actually, you asked us to
stop calling you at work,

you never mentioned your cell
phone.

I want you to stop
calling me in general.

All phones, just stop, okay?

Absolutely.

But I'm just going over
your credit report here,

and I see that you've
just applied for a refile

on your first mortgage, is that
correct?

application's still pending.

Why?

Well, right now your
credit score is a 650,

which is marginal,

but if you force me to
report this debt to Experian

that's gonna drop you down to
520?

Wait a second.

Yeah.

It's highly doubtful that
a lender's gonna approve

a refile on a credit score that
low.

In fact, what's likely to happen

is that after your denial,

you're gonna lose your house.

And then your Visa card rates
will triple,

if they don't cancel them all
together.

All because you were too
stubborn

to live up to a medical
obligation.

Insurance was supposed to
cover it.

And that may be the case, Miss
Becker,

but that's between you
and Anthem Blue Cross.

If you would like to stay in
your home

for the foreseeable future,

how about you just give me your
debit card number right now,

and we can make this all go
away.

You do your homework before
you pick up the phone.

Okay?

Pull their credit reports,

scour their social media feed.

You learn as much about
the deadbeat as you can

so you can expose their
Achilles' heel,

that's when you hit them.

You threaten to take away the
one thing

that matters most to them.

You close every time.

[tense music]


And just so we're clear,

if you tell anyone that
I did this for you,

I will rip your heart
out of your fucking chest

and wipe your vagina with it.

Okay?

Buckle up, fellas.

We're about to get a serious
contact high

from all the coke and booze

seeping out of his pores.

How's my son doing at your
little house of extortion?

Well, why don't you call him

and you can find out?

I'm afraid that ship has
sailed.

Don't judge me, Mr. Debt
Collector.

One day, if and when you become
a father,

maybe you'll understand
why I did what I did.

How absolutely sick he
made me and my wife,

and the pain he caused our
family.

[tense music]

You know, you and I,

we have more in common than you
think.

You see, we both used to be
dads.

The difference is you gave up
that right

with one fell swoop of your
signature

on a fucking checkbook.

See, my fatherhood was
ripped from my soul.

You don't know the meaning of
pain.

You disgust me.

And make sure you don't ever

fucking talk to me ever again.

What the fuck are you two
looking at?

[tense music]

Turn around.

[ominous music]

Hello?

Hello, Mr. Heller.

This is attorney Les
Marcus of How & Lindow

pre-litigation department.

I'm calling about your
delinquent

Capital One credit card account.

Capital One?

I ain't use that card in years.

Well, that may be true,

but it appears you left
a significant balance

when you canceled the
card, which with interest,

has now accumulated to
$15,475 dollars and 85 cents.

You're out of your
mind, that's impossible.

I'm afraid it's not, Mr.
Heller.

And unfortunately, Capital
One has instructed me

to initiate a lawsuit against
you,

unless you can take care
of the balance today.

I can't afford that kind of
money,

so go ahead and sue me.

Okay, that's fine.

We'll send a processed
server down to your diner

at approximately 4 p.m.

No, no, wait, wait, wait.

Don't come to my place of work.

I will get fired, and
I need this job, man.

something

to take care of your
obligations, sir.

If not, we'll be forced to

serve you personally at your
work.

We'll also get a judgment
against you

and garnish your wages.

Highly doubtful that your boss
will be

very appreciative of having
to deal with the sheriff

on that situation.

Please, man, I just can't
afford to pay that much.

client,

see if they can take a slight
reduction on the balance,

get you on a payment plan.

Sound good?

Okay, sure, yeah, whatever.

Closed.

Thank you.

[lighthearted music]

[Sean laughs]

Cash money, baby.

Sorry, but I don't
think I can go that low

unless you give it to us in a
lump sum.

Well, I get it, but that's
just not my problem.

You're gonna have to do
better than that, Mrs. Force,

or I really don't want to
intercept

that tax refund you were
expecting.

Uh huh, yeah.

That's all I need.

Have you thought about
taking out a payday loan

to cover this debt?

[Sean sniffs]

Sure you can.

Here, I'll tell you what,

I'll leave you the
offer open for 24 hours.

How's that sound?

Mr. Humphrey.

Yeah, we've got you at $1,647
dollars.

That's not gonna cut it.

Okay, great.

â™ª Dancing with the devil â™ª

â™ª And you best be fast on your

[Sean sniffs]

â™ª You always lose your sense of
views â™ª

â™ª By thinking that you're

â™ª Digging down your pocket blues â™ª

[Sean groans]

â™ª All the reasons why â™ª

â™ª Send them to your â™ª

Yes, sir, that's a deal.

I'm gonna transfer you over to
Juanita,

she can take down your
credit card info ASAP.

All right?

Thank you.

Everybody, listen up!

Next round, complete.

Daniel, get the fuck out.

Yo, Brandon!

Where the fuck are you, bro?

Answer my calls!

Fuck!

[dramatic music]

Here you boys go.

The apex of the pyramid.

What do we know about it?

High profile mortgage debt,

virtually uncollectible.

We're gonna have to be
real creative on this one.

Well, you don't seem too
concerned.

At the end of the
day we 10x'd our money,

we all made personal profit,

and we got cushion for
the next run, right?

I think they forgot the vodka.

Ay, ay, ay.

[wistful music]

We've been partners
for what, 16 years now?

Best friends for longer, right?

Yeah.

So, is there anything
you need to tell me?

What do you have in mind,
Ross?

Oh, I don't know,

like did you have a
giant fucking brain tumor

or an organ eating amoeba,

or some kind of shit that
I need to know about?

Because you haven't been
in the office for weeks,

you're not returning phone
calls,

you're not returning texts.

The timing of it really sucks a
dick

considering everything
that's at stake here.

Now, if Sean wasn't out
here slaying it for us,

who by the way, I taught to do
this

as a favor for you

while you were jerking
off in some titty bar,

but that's besides the point.

If Sean hadn't been out
there slaying it for us,

we would've lost our
investment and its portfolio.

Right.

If you stop worrying
about my personal life

and start worrying
about the hotshot, then-

Are you fucking kidding me?

[tense music]

What are you doing here?

Business meeting.

I see.

Rough night?

It's none of your business.

You didn't deposit the check.

Why?

You know, maybe part of me
thought

that there was a chance of
a reconciliation, who knows?

Who cares?

It's all history.

Your mother.

She's spiraling downward.

You should get in touch with
her.

She's your family, Sean.

No, AMG Receivables is
my family, it's my life.

I found my calling, so give her
my best.

[tense music]

Fucking fuck!

[dramatic music]

Aw, shit.

[Ross groans]

Ah, shit.

Fuck.

[intense rock music]

[machine beeps]

[Sean sniffs]

[tense music]

Fuck!

[tense music]

Don't just fucking stand there
man,

get your ass in here.

Oh, bless you child.

Take a seat there,

and watch out for Walter.

Oh!

Fuck me.

You know, seeing you go to
town on that

half naked in your robe
really gives me the feels.

Yeah, well, go fuck yourself.

San Quentin doc diagnosed me

with an enlarged left ventricle
years ago.

I've just gotta get it under
control.

My heart's too big.

[Ross chuckles]

How long did you serve?

5.

Shit.

Yup.

Felony battery.

Tossed the starting
linebacker in high school

through a glass door.

His daddy was a high
powered attorney, go figure.

Made sure I did real
time despite the plea.

He just knocked the shit out of
Brandon,

I was steppin' in.

All 'cause this shitbag wouldn't
pony up

on his losses from a football
wager.

Bookie Brandon.

That makes sense, given
the current profession.

Oh, before his glamorous
existence,

Brandon Cazz was dirt poor.

Sophomore year in high school

his family immigrates from
Russia,

leave all their money behind.

He moves into the duplex next
door,

and I'm thinking oh, great,

another fuckin' beetle
eater in the slums, right?

[Sean chuckles]

But he was different.

I took him under my wing.

Actually, it turned
out to be the opposite.

Right out of the gate,

he comes up with this idea

to start taking bets in high
school.

You know, he crunches, I
collect,

it was perfect pairing.

Worked out well for years
too, until that night.

Then you got out, and
the rest is history?

And now, here you sit,

looking to extort money out
of a drug cartel lieutenant.

From his wife.

So, why me?

I need help.

And from where I'm sitting,
it looks like you do too.

50/50?

All right.

Let's hear it.


I'll come pick you up after
work.

morning?

Yeah, I'll still be up.

Okay, I gotta go.

Someone's at my door.


Hi, Miss Salinas?

Agent Frida Lando with INS.

You might if I step inside?

I did not give you
permission to enter this house.

My husband is on his way home.

Well, I guess we'll
be waiting for a while.

How long was his sentence again?

64545 Homewood Circle.

10,750 square feet, 8 bedrooms,

indoor pool.

Racketball court, 7 car garage.

It's a hell of a property,

if I do say so myself.

[Ross chuckles]

Talk about life coming at
you like a fright train, huh?

Yes, I once lived a glamorous
existence,

and now my husband is locked up,

our house is foreclosed
upon, and we lost everything.

The American dream.

Are you here to rub salt on the
wound

or does your visit serve a
purpose?

I don't know if you
recall, Miss Salinas,

but when the DEA arrested Mario,

your house was seized
as a matter of right.

However, unbeknownst to us,

your husband had previously
refinanced his second mortgage,

freeing up almost 5
million dollars in cash,

which has seemingly disappeared.

Now, in order for us to take
possession of that property,

we had to pay off to lean on the
second

in order to get free and clear
title.

I'm not following.

Essentially, you owe
us a very large debt.

I'm here to collect it.

I don't know if you noticed,

but I'm not exactly
swimming in cash right now.

Are you a U.S. citizen, Miss
Salinas?

Neither is your son, right?

I do not wish to speak with
you

or answer your questions,

I am exercising my
constitutional right

under the Fifth Amendment of
the-

Okay, look.

You may give off the
appearance of being destitute,

Miss Salinas, but I
happen to know for a fact

that your husband transferred
a very large sum of money

to an account in Mexico City

right before he went inside.

Now, if the U.S. government
is not in possession

of the full four and half
million dollars

within the next 7 days,

I've been instructed to come
back here

with half a dozen ICE agents
and throw your ass in jail,

and deport your son to Nicara-

No, don't you dare take my
son!

I'm sorry, Miss Salinas,
I have my marching orders.

And you have a week to come up
with

four and a half million dollars.

No, wait, no, please.

I don't know anything about this
money.

Well then, I suggest
you familiarize yourself

with your husband's business
affairs.

Okay?

[tense music]

[Ross sighs]

Well?

We're in play.

What's next?

Now we wait.

[dramatic music]

You lied to me.

Oh, come on, don't
start this shit again.

I'm not talking about that,
Mario.

I'm talking about all the debt.

The lines of credit you
took out on our homes,

the back taxes you owe the IRS.

That's on me, you don't have
to worry.

No, that's on us.

Specifically on Gio, your seed.

And they want it all back.

Who?

The U.S. government, the
IRS, the INS, who knows.

All I can say is that
they paid me a visit,

and if I don't deliver it,

ICE is gonna come knocking down
on my door

and take our son away.

You know what's been
happening at the border?

Children getting separated
from their families.

They're getting sick, they are
dying.

That can happen to Gio.

No.

No!

How much?

4.5 million.

They know about the accounts,
Mario.

The money you hid from them,
from us.

Hey, we were supposed to be a
team.

We're supposed to be partners.

It was an insurance
policy to keep you safe

until I got out.

Edgar was supposed to handle
this.

Until you got out?

You're serving two
consecutive life sentences.

You saw how we've been living,

what I've been doing to myself

to keep this family above water.

I'm sorry, baby.

I'm sorry.

You have to make it up to me.

Cash out that policy.

Please.

[tense music]

Wake up.

Ross.

You know, it's not every day

that your girlfriend stands you
up.

Fuck that guy!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

Wait.

Just wait, just wait, just wait.

Look, it's not a good time,
okay?

Can we talk about this later?

Not a good time?

No.

I was up all night waiting for
you.

Like, no drugs all night,

you could at least text me.

I said I was sorry.

Brandon, I need you to leave.

What are you not saying?

Brandon, leave, please.

You know, if you're in
trouble-

No!

I can help you.

Don't touch me.

It's a family issue, okay?

You're not my husband, I'm
not your responsibility.

Fuck.

Jesus Christ.

He's playing us.

It doesn't make sense.

I told you, he's off.

I'm not gonna let him dick us
over.

[cell phone rings]

Okay.

Agent Frida Lander.


How can I help you, Miss
Salinas?

You'll have your money by 4:30
tomorrow.

Until then, give us one night of
peace.

Okay?

Let's hope it's all
there, for your son's sake.

What about Brandon?

Fuck him.

He's my problem.

[dramatic music]

[cell phone buzzes]

you?

Yeah, can't really talk right
now.

Are you guys okay?

I'm worried about your mom.

Not sure.

She's been freaking out about my
papi.

What about him?

Something about how he
owes someone a lot of money.


Gio, we gotta go.

What's his name?

go.

[tense music]

Nice of you to finally show up
for work.

What was the play, huh?

I'm not following.

Once you collected,

what bullshit were you gonna
spew

to hide that money from us?

Kinda funny that the mark

just happens to be your
girlfriend.

You know, I think you need
to back down on this one.

Oh, I'm not gonna back down on
shit.

Brother, it's not about the
money, okay?

Not on this.

No, bullshit, it's about the
money.

It's always about the fuckin'
money,

that was our deal from the get
go.

Back when we started taking
bets,

and muscling needs from
their daddy's allowance.

I sacrificed five years of
hard time for you, Brandon.

Five fucking years!

And this is how you pay me back?

You go and get pussy-whipped.

Bro, your head is so far
up her fuckin' vagina,

I can't even pull you out with a
rope,

and you're out of your damn mind

if you think for five seconds

that her kid's gonna replace
Sammy.

Shut the fuck up!

Ross, I'm sorry.

[men grunting]

Fuckin' stop!

Brandon, Brandon.

Help.

Hey buddy, hey.

Hey, man.

[dramatic music]

Outside.

Pay the money and walk away.

[tense music]

Oh my God.

[dramatic music]

No!

[cell phone rings]

Gio, come on, come on.


Baby.


Listen, listen, listen to me.

Come on, come on.

Come on!

Baby, baby.

Go, go, baby.

Go, go, baby.

Go, go.
