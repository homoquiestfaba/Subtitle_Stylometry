<font face="Merriweather">The first time I saw herâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I remember it very clearly.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It was like, I was there with her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I mean,
there was this sense of awe,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the sound of the TV
almost like dropped out,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I just-- I couldn't
take my eyes off of her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In America,
with education and hard work,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it really does not matter
where you came from,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it matters only where you are going.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[applause]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Literally, my heart
skipped a beat when I saw her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is my secret that I've been
walking around with for years.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cheers, Mom!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">May you live as long as you want,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and never want as long as you live.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's good. I like that one.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Okay.
That's very good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You look nervous,
what have you got to tell me?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ah... I have--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've found someone.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Really?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah.
Good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Who?
Um...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For the last...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">six years or so, um...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've been in love with, uh...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughs]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Condi, Condi,
I'm begging on my knees</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The desperate outlaws
from Baghdad to Belgrade</font>

<font face="Merriweather">are still there
and must be dealt with.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[applause]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Condi, Condi</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's one of the most
powerful women in the world</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she's also the girl next door.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Your quest is a way
to frame Condi's story.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want to shine light on
this extraordinary woman</font>

<font face="Merriweather">very few people
know anything about.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Condi, Condi
  Oh, Condi, Condi</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was born and bred
in New York City</font>

<font face="Merriweather">on the Upper West Side.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've always had
a passion for music</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and it's always been my dream
to get signed by a major label...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[rock music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But now I've had a new dream.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's time for me to find her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and to win her heart.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If I'm gonna stand a chance,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've got to learn
everything about her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Talk to the people
who know her best,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so I've agreed to let
my friend Sebastian</font>

<font face="Merriweather">make a documentary
about my courtship.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In return,
he's going to help me to meet her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is my best shot for finding
love, I can't blow it now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We start in Alabama
where she was born.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We then go to Denver
where she found her calling</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to go from Denver to Stanford
all the way to Washington, D.C.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">where she currently resides
and where she came to power.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm being deadly serious.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mom, she's one of the most...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I thought you were gay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is something that I did
not even want to tell you now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I feel like an idiot that I got
talked into telling you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think you're-- I think
you think you really are, right?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think your brain's
a little addlepated right now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's -- I don't know, honey,
but you know, I know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know being in love
is very close to being insane.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So you have no intention
of getting an apartment?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The money
that you have been saving,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- you've been working towards...
Yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">...That you were going
to use for an apartment</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you're going to use on some...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">demented odyssey?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No! I'm using the money
that I've been saving to get--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For the apartment.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, or a house to share with her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You can't even do
your own laundry.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Dad, she has people to do...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice,
are you fucking nuts?!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So what are you looking at?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hold on,
I wanna show you something.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's-- it's hard to imagine
my life without music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I certainly find it as a way</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to completely transport
into another world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My secret weapon is music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's the thing that we
have the most in common.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have always had really
eclectic taste in music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I love very, very hard rock;
rhythm and blues;</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Motown.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Some mornings it's Brahms
some mornings it's Cream.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So tell us about the films
you've been making for her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Love discs are love letters
in music and pictures.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've been making them
for the past five years,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but I've only sent one out.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is my first love disc ever.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's a little dated,
but I'm still rather proud of it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll hold your hand,
together we'll stand</font>

<font face="Merriweather">On the brink of a brand-new day</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No more god-awful stuff</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Darlin', you've had enough</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And I've come to take you away</font>

<font face="Merriweather">With each cowardly blow</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No matter how low they go</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll pick you up and carry you away</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm your knight in shining armor</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're my damsel
who's had too much stress</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Chill, Condi, chill</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Chill, Condi, chill</font>

<font face="Merriweather">...and that's enough of that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That was five years ago and they
have gotten better since then.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have had my share of the ladies,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but none of them have
been as accomplished</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or as talented
or as interesting as she is.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Compared to her they're
as deep as a shot glass.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When I think of all the men
in her life, you know, all these</font>

<font face="Merriweather">powerful professional men,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just can't believe that
she hasn't been snagged up yet.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, wouldn't we all
love to find somebody that</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you'd want to live
the rest of your life with?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sure, but I've never thought
you wanted to get married</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the abstract.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You want to get
married to someone.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think with the love discs
that you're helping me to make,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">how can she resist?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is a song
I wrote called Invisible.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All my life, I've done nothing</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's been no hope,
I've been waiting</font>

<font face="Merriweather">To give my love</font>

<font face="Merriweather">People see through me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I am invisible through and through</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And then I saw
you in a sea of blank faces</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Amid all the people you stood alone</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You looked right through them</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And you saw me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've been invisible
till I found you</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Where did
the inspiration come from?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, a lot of people have
a lot of pretentious answers</font>

<font face="Merriweather">about their inspiration,
but I just-- it just-- it--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it comes to me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when I think about her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi is my muse.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[applause]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm about to head off to Alabama.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Very excited.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is the first love
disc that you and I</font>

<font face="Merriweather">have created together.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sending it off to her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Here we go.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh my God, I just did it.

<font face="Merriweather">[traffic noises]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now I'm a man, I'm a man</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Man, I am blood,
sausage and sorrow</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And they'll never know, they'll
never know, they'll never know</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What I got to give you,
don't you know</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[PA announcement]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">From day one, I had great
respect for Condoleezza Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm a great admirer
of Secretary Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she's a great American.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look at this face!
Beauty and intelligence.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thatâ€™s great.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I grew up in a very nice, sheltered</font>

<font face="Merriweather">little middle-class
community in Birmingham.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My mother was
a school teacher,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">my father was a minister
and a high school guidance counselor</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I'm still friends with a lot of
the kids from that community.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Vanessa, very nice to meet you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm Sebastian.
I'm the director.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, how are you doing?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now let me introduce you to Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, Devin is
our love-struck courtier.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Pleasure to meet you.
Hi, how are you doing, Devin?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm just a normal guy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- How are you?
Yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So when did you first meet Condi?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We were both five years old.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I moved across
the street from her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was literally
the girl next door?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.
It's the girl across the street.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Across the street?
Across the street.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes.
Wow.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay, we're going
to see the hospital.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is where
it all started, right?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Is this where
Condoleezza was born?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah.
In this hospital?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In this hospital.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Why was this all boarded?
Why is it all boarded up now?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look, Devin,
this is how it looked in 1954.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look at those cars.
Those old cars.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, that was 1954.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, why did they let this go?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I mean this should be a landmark.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was born here
November 14, 1954.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- She was born November 14th.
Why is that special?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's when my mother was born.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's this-- that's
my mother's birthday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Your mother's birthday
is November 14th?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes.
Oh, okay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look.
Take a look.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">November 14th.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, okay, that's mom's birthday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, that's mom's-- Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mom's birthday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You gonna get one that says
Condi on that side?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes!
[laughs]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We're going around
and see what it looks like.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- See.
I'm Father Alex.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Nice to meet you.
Father Alex?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you.
This is Vanessa.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm Vanessa.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you have any idea
why they would close--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">why they would close this hospital?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Because of
the civil rights movement,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">other hospitals in Birmingham</font>

<font face="Merriweather">became accessible
to African Americans,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so this hospital no longer
had an appeal or a need</font>

<font face="Merriweather">as it did at one time where
you couldn't have a child, a baby,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">except at this hospital
if you were black.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you know where
the actual maternity award was?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm equally nervous and excited.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's gonna be dark in here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wow.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I can't believe
that we're actually here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[sombre music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[infants crying in background]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's said that room 304</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was most likely the room
where she was born.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wait, seriously?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Is that really it?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Devin!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Probably it's two beds.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">See?
Probably it's two beds.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is the Genesis.
This is where it started.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For the first three years
of my life, we literally lived</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the back of the church</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I'm very
proud of that heritage.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was a Christian from day one.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In fact, her father
was a preacher and read her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the Ten Commandments
as a little girl.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She prays every day.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She goes to church regularly.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She believes that god
has set forth a plan.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">One reason why she doesn't
really look back that much</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is she doesn't dwell on the kind
of mistakes she might have made,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because what is happening
is that God's plan is unfolding.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've never doubted
the existence of God.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My father was a theologian
and I can remember</font>

<font face="Merriweather">from the time I was
a very young kid,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">debating with him about the Bible</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and debating about
this aspect of Jesus life.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He never made me feel
that my faith and my intellect</font>

<font face="Merriweather">were at war with one another.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's where she grew up.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The house is still the same,
except it's a different color.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It was a dark green.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wow.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">See, that's the house.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">One year snow, and we
made a big snowman.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Mm-hmm.
Right here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look at that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You see that's her on the left
and that's me on the right.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah, yeah, sure.
That was January 1962.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And we played outside a lot.
We liked that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Six years and I never
thought I'd be this close.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How many mornings would she come</font>

<font face="Merriweather">racing out the door
to go to school.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There she is with her dolls.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh my goodness.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is right here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was standing right here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, standing right
there at the bottom the step.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Actually, it's a pretty good ratio</font>

<font face="Merriweather">between me
and you and Condi and the doll.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, Maria.
This is Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, how you doing?
Come on in.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thank you very much.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wow!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She used to run right through
here outside to meet you and play.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mm-hmm.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Where do you think the piano was?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe the piano
was on this side.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Music played a very
important role in my childhood.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My mother, my grandmother and my
great-grandmother all played piano.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My grandmother
was also a piano teacher</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I would bang at the piano</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when she taught her
students trying to emulate</font>

<font face="Merriweather">what she was
doing with her students,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so she said to my mother,
"Let's teach her to play."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was only about
three and as a result</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I learned to play very, very young.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I could read music
before I could read.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">By the time she was five,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she could play Beethoven
and other classical music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was--
she was good as a little girl.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Everybody thought music
was going to be her career.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You've gotten this far.
Come on in and look.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now you're actually in the room.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're actually in the room.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Can you believe it?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She would read her books
and do her homework here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And had a doll collection.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She had a lot of dolls.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I remember going over
to her house with my mom</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she had all her
dolls all nice in a row</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and kept them all cute
and then we would sit them down</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at little tables and have tea parties.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They would be our
friends at the tea party.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Was she a good tea host?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was always polite and offer
you what she had, you know.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was the girl next door.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She went to church with us.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She bowled and she became the most
powerful woman in the world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Just because she was a woman
and just because she was black</font>

<font face="Merriweather">did not stop her from doing
what she wanted to do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Our parents told us, "All right,
it may be that you can't have</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a hamburger at
the Woolworth's lunch counter</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and it may be that you can't go
to this amusement park Kiddyland,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but don't worry,
you can do anything you want.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Your horizon should be limitless."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">John Rice who was
a Presbyterian minister</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was the most important
person in Condoleezza Rice's life.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Kind of a big mountain of a man,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who really believed the most
important thing he could do</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for black children, uh,
including his daughter</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was to give them
a sense of self and pride.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Segregation wouldn't
matter in your life;</font>

<font face="Merriweather">racism would not
matter in your life,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you can be whatever you want to be</font>

<font face="Merriweather">regardless of whatever the outside
world tries to enforce upon you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When you were in school
in segregated Birmingham,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">teachers said unashamedly,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"You will have to work
twice as hard to get ahead</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and if you really
want to get ahead,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you may have to work
three times as hard"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and they never said,
"And isn't that unfair?"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They stated it in the most
matter-of-fact way</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and it did teach us all
to sort of get on with life.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[school bell]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think Condoleezza
is a really good example</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because she's someone
who came from this community.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It allows our children to see that,
you know, people that come from</font>

<font face="Merriweather">this community can do great things,
so I would say a role model.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I came to school here because
my uncle taught school here</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at Brunetta C. Hill,
and so at the end of the day,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I would go home with my uncle.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What do you think
Condoleezza would think of me?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, I would say
she would have to meet you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You seem to be friendly.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think you would
have to like music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I play the piano too.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, well, oh she would love that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You all could do a duet together.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, that sounds pretty good to me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[Singing under his breath]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Birmingham is a symbol of hardcore
resistance to integration.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It is probably the most
thoroughly segregated city</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the United States.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She came of age in the critical
years of multi-racial America</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when it was really make or break.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Was segregation gonna
survive or be knocked out?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I remember very well in 1963
when Birmingham was so violent</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when it acquired
the name Bombingham.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Even with my
wonderfully protective family,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you had to wonder, why
are they doing this to us?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza was very seldom seen.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was an assistant when
I would cut the grass at the church</font>

<font face="Merriweather">across the street,
Westminster Presbyterian.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I sometimes would go to the house
with a lawn mower, stuff like that,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I could see her
peeping out the door.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">See, she was a kept-in child.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There were certain areas
in this city like</font>

<font face="Merriweather">walking to the store at night,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">my mom would
not let me walk alone.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I would have to go with at
least one or two of my brothers</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for the fear of the night riders.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I wonder if she ever
saw any of these people.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I wonder if she ever encountered</font>

<font face="Merriweather">these wraith-like images
coming up to her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Such a symbol of hate and fear.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is the church
that turned things around</font>

<font face="Merriweather">September 15, '63.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You see the cornerstone
on the church?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Mm-hmm.
Those first windows</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to the right, this was
the Sunday school area.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They're getting ready
for a Sunday school play.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[glass shatters]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They broke into Saturday
night before, set the bomb.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The bomb went off at 10:22.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Since Sunday school
is from 9:30 to 10:30,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">regular church is 11 to 1.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So there was no question
who the-- who the targets were.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Okay?
And it was specifically</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- set for the children.
Specifically set for the kids.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The Sunday school
and the Sunday school time.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's awful.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">These were innocent children.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This was homegrown terrorism.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">These little girls weren't
going to hurt anybody.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When the bomb went off,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't know where
Condoleezza was.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know where my daughter was,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she was over at
the 16th street Baptist church.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was in the little
ladies room downstairs</font>

<font face="Merriweather">getting her clothes
changed to whatever</font>

<font face="Merriweather">they were going to do that Sunday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I drove over
to the University Hospital</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that's where we found her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and lying up there on the table</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with three other girls
and it was very painful.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Denise McNair was my
little friend from kindergarten</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she was a playmate, you know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I just couldn't
believe that she was dead.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What stands out
in Condi Rice's mind</font>

<font face="Merriweather">about that bombing is particularly
memories of the funeral.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She recalls being very moved
by seeing those little coffins.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's an image that has
been emblazoned in her memory.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Who would have
thought in September 1963</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when my little
classmate Denise McNair</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was killed in the bombing
of that church</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that I would stand before
you as Secretary of State.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice's father took her
to the White House in Washington.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was 10 years old.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They looked at the White House,
she said I want to be there.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was on a mission
from her earliest age</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to prove to her
father, to her mother.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Rising up in those very
tough years in Birmingham,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">her mission was to get to the top,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to get to the top politically
and that's exactly what she did.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So this time we need
a dedication to I think which is really</font>

<font face="Merriweather">tender and warm and sweet.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Action!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, it's Devin Ratray again.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This song that I wrote for--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No.
See in the lens.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">See Condi's beautiful face.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't see Condi's
beautiful face in the camera,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I see my double chin in the camera.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, there's a difference
between what you see in the lens</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and what I've got.
And you're looking great.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're looking very slim</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- and very fit.
Good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And I have to say,
rather attractive.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Good.
Okay. So let's go.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Take two, and action!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, it's Devin Ratray again</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and this is a dedication of a song</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that I wrote for you, Condoleezza.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cut.
So a couple of notes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">A little bit warmer please,
a little bit more tender.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, it's Devin Ratray again.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I wrote this song thinking
of you and thinking about</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you returning to your roots,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">walking through
the streets of Birmingham.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Walking in your
footsteps really inspired me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I smelled the same air
that filled your sweet lungs.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So I hope you enjoy it
and I hope you get to tell me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in person someday
what you think of it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Alrighty.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thanks.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Standby and...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Action!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I dreamed I took
you back to Alabama</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I saw you running
barefoot in the breeze</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We sat on the piazza
in each other's arms</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In the shadows
of the old orange trees</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And I was guiding your hands</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Teaching you my song</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And to me you were all humanity</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Somewhere in my dreams,
my Condoleezza</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Where the last leaves
are falling from the trees</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You'll never know
you had this power over me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You'll never know
you had this power over me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We've landed in Colorado.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi moved here when
her dad got a job teaching</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at the University of Denver.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She entered 10th Grade
when she was only 13.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's two years younger
than everybody else.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In the last year here,
she was already applying</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and taking classes
at Denver University.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was at both at the same time.
It was amazing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So we're gonna go talk to
some of her former teachers.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[piano]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hello.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hello.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, god.
I'm sorry.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How are you?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I'm Devin.
And I'm Ann.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Hello, Ann, hi.
I'm Louise.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If you had a classroom
full of Condoleezzas,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you'd think you'd died
and gone to heaven.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was a senior in my class</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she was going
to DU at the same time.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was an excellent,
excellent student.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Very serious. Quite astute.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- She aced all of her classes.
Oh yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All of them.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">College as well as high school.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There was no bad subjects.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was good at
everything she did?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, she had
a very academic background.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Her father became
the assistant dean</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at the Graduate School
of International Studies</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I think it was
just in the whole family,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">they were very, very
dedicated and directive to her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think what's happened
to me is 90% upbringing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I really do believe that my
parents were extraordinary</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in what they provided for me
and the kind of self-confidence</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that they gave me
and they never said, no,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you shouldn't do that
or you shouldn't try that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They really had high
expectations for me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and they passed them on.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know, I think that was
hard on her to be so young</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I think she probably felt,
"What am I getting into here?"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and the only black girl in the class.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I understood that something
was deeply wrong</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in Birmingham, Alabama</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when I didn't have
a white classmate</font>

<font face="Merriweather">until we moved to Denver, Colorado.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It didn't take her long to,
you know, acclimate to it,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but she was also practicing
the piano several hours a day.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She wanted to be a concert pianist
at the time she was here</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and if she didn't make
that she was going to be</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a professional ice skater.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was a very,
very bad competitive figure</font>

<font face="Merriweather">skater who worked
exceedingly hard at it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">only to perform badly almost
every time that I competed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But I think those experiences</font>

<font face="Merriweather">did help me to have
a kind of discipline;</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a kind of sense
of organization in life</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and to do a lot of things well.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Very good.
Keep your knees bent,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">waist back, because if you're
going to win her heart right...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- We've got to win her heart.
You gotta learn how to skate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Gotta learn how to skate.
You gotta become a champion.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Gotta be a champion.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I gotta do this.
There you go.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- You got it.
I got it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- You got it, you're going good!
I got it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[thud]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ohh...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I think I got it.
You okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I got it.
Yeah?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Just gotta get up.
Okay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You got it?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ah!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you have any aspirin?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[orchestra]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's hard to imagine
my life without music.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I certainly find it as a way to</font>

<font face="Merriweather">completely transport
into another world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think music might
be the way to her heart?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yes, because...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">music is the way
to many people's hearts.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that serenading
could work today on Condoleezza</font>

<font face="Merriweather">as a courtship technique?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It might very well,
particularly since she has</font>

<font face="Merriweather">such an eclectic taste.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, I would say yes.
Go for it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">As a student, how was
she at taking direction?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In taking very specific technical
directions, she was very good;</font>

<font face="Merriweather">emotional directions, she didn't
have an easy time doing that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">As long as it was
mechanical things: do this,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">hold your hand
this way, or do that, fine,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but as soon
as I touched her inside,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">there was a resistance.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She seemed not to be interested</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in that aspect of music making.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice
ended her music career at 17</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when she was a sophomore
at the University of Denver.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That summer she went
to the Aspen Music Camp</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and there she saw prodigies
who could play from sight,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">music that had taken her
months or weeks to learn.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She saw she wasn't good
enough and she dropped it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with no emotion,
no feeling whatsoever.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's not just talent,
it's that intangible</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that some people have
that just puts them over the top.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I knew I didn't have it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I knew I probably wasn't
going to practice hard enough</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to compensate for it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This was a very important
turning point in Rice's life</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and so in one of our
interviews I asked her about it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she said to me,
"I don't do life crises. Period."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She says she does
not believe in regret.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She thinks life is too short and so
she doesn't look back on mistakes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She keeps looking forward.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Self-reflection is not
something she does.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She believes it's a waste of time</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I think it had
a profound impact.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Her one goal that she had set,
she failed at.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she didn't
want to fail again.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, I was a lost music major
to be truthful about it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I had decided that I was not going
to be a great concert pianist,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but I didn't know what
I was going to be.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I wandered into spring
quarter junior year,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a course in international
politics taught by Josef Korbel,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and he was a wonderful professor
because he was a great story-teller.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He could really put
you there in the Soviet Union</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or in Czechoslovakia
or in Yugoslavia</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I was just taken with him</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and with the history
and I remember the exact lecture</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that won me over and it
was one about how Joseph Stalin</font>

<font face="Merriweather">had consolidated his power
and I thought this is just terrific.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is what I want
to study and I went to him</font>

<font face="Merriweather">not long after that
and I said, "Dr. Korbel,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think I'd like
to study the Soviet Union."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Josef Korbel was the professor</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who turned her on
to international affairs.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He taught her the drama that
was inherent to global politics.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He made her want
to be a political scientist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It was as she put it
"love at first sight."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was fascinated
and she became smitten</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with everything to do with
Russia and Russian politics.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We don't know really
what would have happened</font>

<font face="Merriweather">if Lenin had survived.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It is really Joseph Stalin
that made the Soviet Union</font>

<font face="Merriweather">into what the Soviet Union became:</font>

<font face="Merriweather">militarized, secretive,
a Byzantine state</font>

<font face="Merriweather">behind the walls
of the Kremlin,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a state with pretensions
to greatness</font>

<font face="Merriweather">on the international scene.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Joseph Stalin,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that is really the legacy
of the Soviet Union, not Lenin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now the other extraordinary
thing about Josef Korbel</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was that he was also
the father of Madeleine Albright.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So he actually
is a man who had the two</font>

<font face="Merriweather">American female
secretaries of state in history,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who were both as they
both would tell you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the daughters of Josef Korbel.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Albright literally
and Condoleezza Rice,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she says uh, figuratively,
he was her second father.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, Korbel was what
is known as a realist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">A kind of group
of foreign policy specialists</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who believe you deal
with states as they are,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you know, great powers.
The internal dynamics</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of those states doesn't
quite matter as much.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Realists don't believe
and don't trust moral aspirations.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They don't trust
countries that say,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"We're the moral ones, we're
doing-- we have God on our side,"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">realists don't trust that stuff.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There is that belief
in the concept of America</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that is an important part
of Rice's philosophy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think I have athlete's--
Athleteâ€™s complex.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She once said, "I will
only marry a football player."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've got to do
something about this.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, we need to get
you to meet these guys.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They're the people
who can teach you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What about contacting
that ex-fiancÃ© of hers,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the football star, Rick Upchurch?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You can meet him, you can
say whatever you want to him,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm not gonna have anything
to do with it though.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We're setting up an interview.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You do the interview so
what's the problem with that?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You want me to do
an interview with the one man</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that was engaged to her?
Don't even bother.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's no way I'm going.
I'm not doing it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm not doing it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hello, Devin, how are you?
Hello, Sebastian.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- It's a great pleasure.
Honor and a pleasure.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Today is Condoleezza's birthday</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and this is the first time
that I've had the opportunity</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to tell the story.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There was tens
of thousands of young ladies</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that were here in this stadium</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and there was only one young lady</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that I really wanted
and that was Condoleezza.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When Condoleezza first saw me,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was in my second year
with the Denver Broncos</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I just remember I had
a fantastic year that year.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I had set a couple of records,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">had returned two punt
returns, man, in one game</font>

<font face="Merriweather">against the Cleveland Browns.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I ended up tying a record
for touchdowns in a season.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All of a sudden, everybody
was starting to recognize</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that Rick Upchurch was here
and he was making some noise</font>

<font face="Merriweather">out on the football field.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My first encounter was going
over to Condoleezza's house</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and meeting Dr. John Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and talking with him about school</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she met me and says,
"Oh, you're that--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you're that guy that that returns
those punts and that whole deal."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she says,
"You're a pretty good ball player."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She really focused
in on the football aspect of it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because she was really
interested in the game.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi's appetite
for football is just like war.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She likes to strategize
and put herself in a--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in a position of power</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and a position of control</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and being able to make decisions</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she would probably be
one heck of a football coach.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The thing that I knew</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is that she had a lot
of smarts about her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Very intelligent.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Some of the questions
she would ask</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and the things that she would
talk about just let you know</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that this was a lady with a lot
of class and a lot of poise.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was truly
an American princess.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay, this is where
I first met Condoleezza.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is where I first
courted Condoleezza</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and this is where
I proposed to Condoleezza.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now, where was it that you first
held Condoleezza's hand?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I first held Condoleezza's
hand in the house.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">One night I was
getting ready to leave</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I just grabbed her hand</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and just told her I said,
good night.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And where was the first
place that you kissed her?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The first place that I that
I kissed her was at the door.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">As I was leaving,
I gave her-- I gave her a kiss.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When I said I loved her, she
actually looked at me and says,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"You know, I like you too,"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you know, and uh,
and at that point in time</font>

<font face="Merriweather">um, I felt like, you know,
we could go some places</font>

<font face="Merriweather">as far as our
relationship was concerned.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know, I like cheeks
and she had big cheeks.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She had some juicy cheeks.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just wanted to kiss 'em,
so I kissed 'em.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And was there
a lot of cheek action</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in terms of touching
her cheeks and...?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Absolutely.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What I would do is I would put my
hand up and just touch her cheeks</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that whole deal
and I would kiss her on her cheeks.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[makes kissing sounds]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And where was the first time</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you had your first like</font>

<font face="Merriweather">what is traditionally
known as a French kiss?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Never did.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Didn't have no
French kiss with her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I never had
a French kiss with her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know,
Condoleezza had gone out on dates</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and had seen other people uh, and,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and one thing
that she says is that she was--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she was respectful of her body</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that was
something that she was going to</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to save for marriage.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She would date
and she would meet people,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but going outside of that,
she would not do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She didn't feel like
she needed to give her body up</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to show her love to anyone</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and so she wasn't going
to have sex before marriage.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's not married now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that she's
kept that promise?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think Condoleezza Rice today</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is still holding on
to those same principles.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In England we had
the Queen Elizabeth I,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who was known as the Virgin Queen.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What do you think it means to
be the virgin secretary of state?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, I'm not-- yeah,
I'm not going there.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughs]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm not going there, Sebastian.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Here in this room here is where
I first proposed to Condoleezza.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hereâ€™s the ring and, um,
the ring wasn't a whole lot.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Imagine Condi is Devin and what
exactly would you say to him?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I said-- I said, "Condoleezza..."
I said, "Condoleezza Rice..."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I said, "Um, I'm in love with you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Would you marry me?"
and she said yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So then I offered the ring to her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I offered the ring
to her and she put it on.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But there was a roadblock there.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She had an offer
to go to Washington, D.C.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and work there.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And we knew at that point in time</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that her job was important to her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and her career was important to her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and by me staying here and by
her going to Washington, D.C.,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that it wouldn't--
it wouldn't work.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She basically chose
Jimmy Carter over you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She chose--
she chose power over love.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She chased her dream
and today she's living that dream.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Another year, another birthday,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but you keep on looking younger.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I am so impressed with you, Condi.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm so impressed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Each new day I find
out more about you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I am so impressed,
you've gone this long holding out</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and sticking to your principles.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Good for you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I hope you enjoy this next
love disc I made for your birthday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Happy birthday.</font>

of Condoleezza as a daughter.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So they're still very, very
close and they talk most Sundays.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh my God, that's her.</font>

Yes.</font>

This is Devin Ratray.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Hi, Devin, how are you?
Hi, Mrs. Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- It's a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure meeting you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm a very big admirer
of your stepdaughter.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you know if she's gotten any
of my discs that I've sent her?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have no idea.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He's a musician and he's writing
songs for her, because he's in lo--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It sounds like it's
a wonderful thing, you know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you guys are positive</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and it's about time something
positive is said about her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But she is an American princess,
isn't she?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, she is.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, that's what we
want to show and who better</font>

<font face="Merriweather">than the American queen who
she says is my second mother...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, yeah but, um,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't do that
without permission. Okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Please let her know
that I'm a huge admirer and...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll talk to her tomorrow and I'll
tell her that I talked to you...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ask her to have
a listen to the discs</font>

<font face="Merriweather">if she's gotten them, please.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You sent them to her?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I have.
Okay. I will.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thank you so much
and your pansies are fantastic.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I love your daughter.
All right.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Thank you.
All right.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[dog growls]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You blindsided her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You didn't even offer to help
her with her-- with her bags.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look at that Mercedes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She nearly bit my finger off.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You deserve it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was an associate dean
in the office of faculty affairs</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when a faculty member came
to us and said that he had just</font>

<font face="Merriweather">discovered a young scholar</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who had given a pretty good paper</font>

<font face="Merriweather">on Sino-Soviet relationships</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and he thought that it
might be wonderful for Stanford</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to use Affirmative Action
funds in this way</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and so money was made
available for her appointment.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm sure there was a concern</font>

<font face="Merriweather">not to miss
an extraordinary opportunity</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to hire someone who was a woman,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who was black and who was also,
you know, stunning</font>

<font face="Merriweather">personally and intellectually.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She discussed with me
how she was counted six times</font>

<font face="Merriweather">as a black and a woman
for Affirmative Action purposes</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the Arms Control,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Disarmament set of
the Political Science Department</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and one other unit, so she actually
showed up as six at Stanford.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So she was making fun</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of the Stanford
Affirmative Action Program.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's admitted at various
times that she's a beneficiary</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of Affirmative Action,
yet she uses her personal story</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to say â€œI didn't need
government action.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I didn't need public
protest to advance.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I advanced, um, all on my own.â€</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm clearly a package:
I'm black and I'm female,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but I've always thought
that the most important thing</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is to do your job and do it well</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and don't question other people's
motives for your selection.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice, uh,
in 1991 was made provost.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's the youngest
person ever to get that job,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the only African-American,
the only woman.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Suddenly she's inheriting
a deficit in the budget</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of some 20 million dollars.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For my 20th tenure at Stanford,
she called me in.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She said, "Oh, Cecilia,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm so glad to see you
and I want to thank you</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because you really
were so helpful to my father</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that's why this
is a bit hard but, you know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know you're not happy</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I know you want to leave,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so I'm making it
possible for you to leave."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We were quiet,
I stood up, I walked out</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she said to her
secretary in a deep sort of--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she took a deep
breath and she said,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"Oh, good. Who's next?"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I always remember that little tone.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cecilia Burciaga was the first Latina</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to make it to the top of Stanford.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was a super
popular Dean of Students</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she had a center
where students love to come.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is a woman who
was simply cut down.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Her career destroyed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This was sort of Condoleezza Rice's
step to advancement.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For her it was more
important to show she was tough,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">show she could cut the budget
even when it came down</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to cutting the most
advanced Latina.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It was a very contentious
decision at the Stanford campus.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The numbers show
that when she became provost,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she basically
reversed what had been</font>

<font face="Merriweather">an institutional
commitment by Stanford</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to try to diversify its faculty</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and the upper levels
of its administrative staff.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She essentially kind
of pulled up the ladder,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you know, after she
had gotten that helping hand.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In education in particular</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I continue to believe
that Affirmative Action</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that is not driven by quotas</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is an extremely
important thing to practice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">A college-based
committee formed a report,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">produced a report about
the state of play of race relations</font>

<font face="Merriweather">on the campus and the degree to
which the college was not obeying,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">uh, that dictates, the demands
of Affirmative Action,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice's response
wasn't to try to figure out</font>

<font face="Merriweather">what could be
done to make it better,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">her response was
to debate the data very angrily.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Her name she says
means "with sweetness"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But, you know,
she says she speaks Spanish</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so she always also
knows that her name means</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condolencia: "with pain."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Um...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Devin, do you have any questions?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think her sense of fashion
has defined her as a woman</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and as a politician?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, look at me,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because I'm naked,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Dev, it's good, it's good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah?
How are you feeling?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sorry, I just didn't
want to be boring.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And it's a little boring.
That's my only concern.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My only little concern here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think we just need to sort
of take it to the next level</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and you're completely
in control here</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so you can make
a decision about this,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but this line "look at me
because I'm naked,"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because I think it is--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">this is really justified is to go--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">is to perform this naked.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to show her naked.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to show myself to her
before our wedding night naked.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He was just wonderful.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What kind of tips
do you have for him?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think gentleness
is going to be your key here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And remember, underneath the heart</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of our secretary of state</font>

<font face="Merriweather">beats the heart of a woman.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay, I've written a song
for you because I really think</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that this is important.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza, Condi,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think of you so fondly,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sugar 'n spice, everything nice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wedding bells
and a handful of riceâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Remember,
this is the secretary of state</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she's on the world stage.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I mean,
it's very logical the song,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but there's a romantic feel to it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll be in front of the--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll be in front of the towers</font>

<font face="Merriweather">At the Watergate</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Important word is Watergate.
Hmm.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's where
she lives and think of it as,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't like her
hairstyles sometimes but...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Why?
I don't know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but towers is very good</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because she lives
in the towers at the Watergate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Get it?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Your beauty's in everything</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That I see,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi, you mean
the world to me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">To me...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">God you're almost
as good as PlÃ¡cido Domingo.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thank you!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So, Carol, I know you have
another song which is your new,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Gonna Fly Now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes!
That's what I need.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- A type of song like that.
It's... It's...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it's very Rocky-ish.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's a "Yo, Stallone!"
you know, that type of--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it's got tremendous energy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll settle for that just
a measly snack</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If that would make Condi mine!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mine! Mine!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He's gonna win her,
win her, win her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When he is a little thinner,
thinner, thinner</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Win her, win her, win her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When he's thinner</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The trumpets are blaring.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Win her, win her, win her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When he's thinner,
thinner, thinner</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh my god winner, dinner.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh my god, the brownies.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Bravo! Bravo!
Oh, thank you so much.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm so glad you like it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The brownies smell
like they're burning.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How are you feeling?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It sounded kind
of like wet pieces of shit</font>

<font face="Merriweather">sprinkled on a Jerry Lewis film.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Dev...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's perhaps the most
insulting song I've heard thus far.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Excuse me.
Excuse me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't-- I'm not an eavesdropper,
but what the fuck did you just say.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Devin, let me just make
something plain, okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When you become
an Academy Award songwriter,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">then you can sit here and tell me
that I don't know what I'm doing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- God!
I am so upset...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Carol, this song
is making fun of me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- It's telling me...
I'm not making fun of you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- It's genius.
How can I...?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I mean...
Thank you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- This is the secretary...
She's a genius.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Have some respect.
It's a beautiful song.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's well...
No it's a powerful song.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't want
to say it's beautiful.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Powerful?!
The other song is beautiful...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"Just the measly snack
would make me want her back"?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No.
That's not what it says.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Don't fuck up my words.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I-- don't talk to me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Carol, I cannot possibly approach</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The Secretary of State
of The United States</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with this song and expect
her to take me seriously.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Why not?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're denying her one of the
biggest gifts she can give you?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm not singing the song!
I'm not singing the song.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I can't do this.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know something,
I don't want him to sing the song.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't want anybody to sing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Read these lips,
I think George H. Bush said that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Your friend?
Yes. President Bush.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Didn't you sing at
his inauguration?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I sang at George W.'s.
Both of his.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.
Read my lips.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Read my lips.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Okay.
Carol...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- He's doing it.
Guys, together.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is insanity.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I will sing the song together.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Why are you going
to sing the song?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Because it's a great idea.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He's your inner self and I have
to go check the brownies</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and if you're not good you're
not going to get a brownie.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm like-- I can't
even have a brownie?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Peace and love.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Where are we?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, my friend Adrian Grenier,
uh, his offices.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How do you know Adrian?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, we were high school friends.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What do you think
he's talking about?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What do you think
he's talking about, huh?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's dead.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You got to wake up.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hey, what's up?
What's going on, man?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- How you doing?
Good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Really good.
How are you?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think it's very important
that you make sure</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you prove
to her that you show her</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you are being a sincere,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">honorable, loving human being.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Dude, come on secretary of state,
powerful woman,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">boring old white guys all day,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she's got to be
a big dirty submissive</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and you grab her by
the hair and you spank her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, Jim, whoa easy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I mean, you got to be delicate.
Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I mean...
You don't.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Take what's yours.
Smack her around a little bit.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Spank her.
That's what she likes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, whoa.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No, no, no, no.
There's no smacking.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How could I ensure my sincerity?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Just humble yourself.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You have to be able to find some
way into a more tender part of her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, but you got
to remember something.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know, she was
a Democrat until the late '70s?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And because Jimmy Carter
wouldn't invade Afghanistan</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and attack the Russians, she left.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- That's true.
She likes it when you go in.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's with Bush Senior,
she's with Bush Junior.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She likes it when you go
in and take what's yours.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're not going
to get her in the mind.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You got to get her on
like an emotional visceral...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yeah...
Some...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So like I don't know if you like
maybe wore some lingerie</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or something as simple as that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look, I don't want
to fight with you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't want to fight with you,
but I understand the Condi thing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've seen her body,
she's fucking sexy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That little gap between the teeth,
how sexy is that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Just be careful of those teeth.
They can get caught in your bag.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Watch those little...
Fucking, Jim!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Honestly?!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My bag between her gap?!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Is that really advice that I need?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All right, man.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Good luck.
Let's play.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Man, these Hollywood
types have addlepated my brain.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I need some time home
to recharge the batteries</font>

<font face="Merriweather">before that last push to DC.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Hi.
Hi.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, honey-man, welcome home.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Thank you.
Oh, I missed you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi.
I missed you too.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, Dad.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I had to go to Duane Reade
last night.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm standing there at,
uh, on line last night</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and here's the Enquirer:
"who's gay and who's not."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Who's that?
So she's not.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So she's one
of the ones that's not.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, let's see what
the National Enquirer has to say.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, yes, let's see...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">According to the buzz
among political insiders,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it's an open secret that Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice is gay.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">One in-the-know blogger
claimed that during her years</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at California Stanford university,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi was
"Completely out as a lesbian</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and it was not
a scandal, just a reality."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're reading
the National Enquirer.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I totally agree at my
appalling purchase.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're just trying
to get me upset.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just walked in the front door.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm not trying to get you upset.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes, you are!
I'm looking for...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You and she are both
interested in women.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's something in
common that you have.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Devin, Devin, come here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to sleep.
I'm going to bed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- I've been up all night.
We know.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay. It's all right.
It's all right. I'm going to bed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No, no. Come here. Come here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- No, no, no.
You just got home...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know I just got home.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I can't deal
with this right now.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Guys, look please
disconnect the phone.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll unpack tomorrow.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You can't...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Welcome home, dear.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You don't know when to quit,
do you?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Devin, I'm sorry.
Dev?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All because I'm in love.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Doesn't matter.
It's just love.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Long before Condoleezza Rice
was part of the team</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that brought us the Iraq war,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she was one of those who believed</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that corporate
interests come first.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">During the ten years
the Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was on the board
of the Chevron Corporation,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">big oil developers.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They were exploiting
the oil off the coast</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of the Niger Delta in Nigeria.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Home to some
of the world's poorest people</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and indigenous people
like the Ogoni people;</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who at that time were
fighting for some revenue</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to come to them from
this oil that was being</font>

<font face="Merriweather">drained out from
underneath their homeland.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Throughout that period, it was
the Nigerian government's policy</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to suppress protest
and to arrest and, in some cases,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">shoot down and kill the protesters.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The corporations that cut deals
with the Nigerian government</font>

<font face="Merriweather">were complicit with that
and were sued for being complicit</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with that in U.S court.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now, the interesting thing
about your friend Condoleezza Rice,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Devin, is that she was
playing an active role</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in turning shareholder
initiatives back</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when the shareholders were saying</font>

<font face="Merriweather">â€œwe want to be pushing
for more human rights</font>

<font face="Merriweather">not ignoring abuses at
the Nigerian government's hands.â€</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wait. You're saying
the Nigerian government killed</font>

<font face="Merriweather">its own people to ensure</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Chevron had exclusive
oil rights to their country?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah.
I hate to break it to you, Devin,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she picked empire and colonialism
over being a concert pianist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think you've got
to think about that, Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's an easy way
to Condoleezza Rice's heart.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You just need to promise her a few
oil contracts in the Caspian Sea,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">maybe give her a few seats
on a few corporate boards.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Nothing she likes better.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How's he gonna do that?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, you've got your work
cut out for you, let's face it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Great.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She became a member
of the Bush inner circle</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when she was discovered</font>

<font face="Merriweather">by Bush Senior's National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and brought into Washington</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to be part of the National
Security Council.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Here among all these grand
men was this little slip of a girl.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I had never met her before,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but I soon found
that she held her own</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with all these very senior people.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When he introduced her
to Gorbachev, he said,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"This is Condoleezza Rice,
she's taught me everything</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know about the Soviet Union."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Bush Senior wanted
his son George to meet her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Of course she's
a foreign policy specialist</font>

<font face="Merriweather">especially an Eastern
European specialist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He had a lot of studying to do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Can you name
the president of Chechnya?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No, can you?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, the new prime
minister of India is, uh, uh...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">George W. Bush
and Condoleezza Rice hit it off</font>

<font face="Merriweather">from the very beginning,
based on their common affinity,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">uh, in things like, uh, their sports
and their Christian faith.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, they had this instant as one
of Rice's best friends called it</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"mind meld" that happened
from the very beginning.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">During the course
of the 2000 election campaign</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she'd really been President Bush's
tutor on foreign affairs.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">President Bush had
been governor of Texas,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">had very little
background in foreign policy</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or national security.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She's the one who
taught him these issues</font>

<font face="Merriweather">during the course of the campaign.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I advise him on how to take his
very strong principles and values.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What it is that he wants
to do in the world</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and translate those
into policy initiatives.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Rice, when it came to Bush, saw
in this young Texas governor</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the values, the strength,
the vision of Ronald Reagan.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">At the same time,
the moderation and wisdom,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">intelligence of Bush's
father for whom she had worked.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She thought with these
two personalities</font>

<font face="Merriweather">combined into one president,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she thought they could
burst into Washington</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and they were going
to remake the world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Not only to promote
what was good for the world</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but also to promote what's
good for American interests.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">George W. Bush
believes that America</font>

<font face="Merriweather">has a special responsibility
to keep the peace,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that the fair cause of freedom
depends on our strength</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and purpose and I want
to assure you if the time ever comes</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to use military force,
President George W. Bush</font>

<font face="Merriweather">will do so to win because for him,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">victory is not a dirty word.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[cheering and applause]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I realize how much
I have to learn about</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay. We'll call the Palestinians
just for short "scum."</font>

stand on the Middle East?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, she believes

<font face="Merriweather">Okay.</font>

the Palestinians have to have--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Don't play with your hair.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Kill them all.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I need blood."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's what Cheney would say?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, it was a tape recording.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I-- I-- I see.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Pirated.
Yes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you think that putting them
down is gonna help your cause?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I mean, explain to me
here how this is gonna work?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna go in and you're
gonna say these things</font>

<font face="Merriweather">flippantly or are you gonna say
this with convition-- conviction?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There are consequences
for everyone's accountability.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's not conviction.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Conviction is:</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"9/11 changed everything."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Let me hear you say it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">9/11 changed everything.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Even more emphatic.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">9/11 changed everything!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Perfect.
That's conviction.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna get one shot.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're gonna get one opportunity.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you have the words,
do you have the passion,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">do you have the focus of someone</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who can woo her?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're such a beautiful woman.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Can you get him a breath mint,
please?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I can see that you're
a little nervous.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Your hands are clammy,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but I don't want
you to be intimidated by me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">just because I'm a person
who knows what I want...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">But you are a large person.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's more of me to love.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I would strongly urge
that his first meeting</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with the secretary
not be over a meal.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm taking notes here
from the Pillsbury Doughboy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's just not fair.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What you don't understand
is I'm not trying to court</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the secretary of state,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the most powerful
woman on the globe.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is Words that Work.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This book will help
you communicate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Good language is like a great meal</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and I assume that you'd
understand that metaphor.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Didn't see that one coming.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm pleased that you take
this so seriously.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The focus group
is going to tear you apart,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but it's not just words,
it's also appearances.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Well. Devin.
Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is your stylist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to make
you a runway model.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, well you better
reinforce that runway.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He should run away very quickly.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Listen, once you look
at yourself in the mirror</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and you see
this presidential transformation</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that I'm going to create for you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you're going to be mentally ready</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and visually ready to meet her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza loves shoes,
so you must love shoes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The shoes make the man.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's very nice.
That's like I'm going to the prom.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All right.
I look like the Joker.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You have these in a 17?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ever since I was
a little girl I liked to shop.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My father would go
to work on his sermons</font>

<font face="Merriweather">on Saturday morning,
and my mother and I would head</font>

<font face="Merriweather">downtown to go shopping.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she looks very powerful</font>

<font face="Merriweather">despite the fact
that she dresses in a way</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that is both feminine</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and has a certain
degree of sensuality to it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If anything I think it makes her
perhaps look even more powerful.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, God!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's the new Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You have been transformed
into a presidential candidate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe that children
are our future.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I will not be Bush-whipped.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">9/11 changed us all.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ma. Ma?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hi, darling.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All good.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Huh?
Hello.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hello.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What are you doing?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just want-- I just
wanted to tell you that, uh,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm gonna be moving out.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What do you mean?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- For good?
Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yeah, I think.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Um, I could be gone for a while,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so I just wanted to thank you
for everything that you've done.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, you've been very kind.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You've been-- you've
been everything that I</font>

<font face="Merriweather">could possibly want.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Everything I needed.
Why are you so formal?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't know. I don't know.
I've never done this before.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just gotta do it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[cries]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mom. Mom...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, you act like
you don't even care.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Mom.
Come on.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Don't do it.
Don't cry.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I know it's time to fly away,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but where are you going?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm going to Washington...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">D.C.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Need I ask why?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You needn't.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay.
All right.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- So you're going to Washington?
Yeah.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I should have known
that was coming.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're going to see big
things coming from me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, I hope.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have no doubt
about your success.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want you to do anything
that makes you happy</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but stay out of trouble.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I always do that, Mom.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That wasn't so bad.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No, it wasn't, was it?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I suppose I'll hear from you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Yes, you totally will, Mom.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When you want something.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You'll hear from me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Got to your city
and I feel so alive,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm inching closer
to the heart of your mind.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ev'rything I see is like
a monument to you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ev'rything I dream
of is finally comin' true,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm feelin'...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Free in the arms
of the brave and true,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Free in the place
where I've come to find you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No one to tell us how
we're not meant to be...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Baby, we're finally free,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Baby, we're finally free,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">baby, we're finally free...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I am honored, in fact, humbled,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">uh, that President-elect
Bush has asked me</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to serve as his
National Security Adviser.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In January 2001,
when Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">took the oath of office
to be National Security Adviser</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it was, uh,
the ultimate rise in political power.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This we're talking
about a little girl who grew up</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in segregated Birmingham, Alabama</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and yet she had gone
from that place in her life,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">uh, all the way up
to literally the right hand</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of the President of the United States.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm so impressed.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Good to see you.
Good to see you too.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Perfect tie.
Yeah?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Nice suit.
Thank you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's from Florence.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, you still got
the sideburns but, you know what?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, this is so much improvement.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Come on back.
Thanks.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">These are the people right there.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Would you grab a seat?
All right.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Let's take the group.
Thank you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Boy, nothing to make
you relax like a bunch of strangers</font>

<font face="Merriweather">judging everything you say or do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I need a word or phrase</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you would use
to describe Condoleezza Rice?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sophisticated.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well-traveled.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Regal.
Captivating.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Hot.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Together.
Incompetent.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In some ways, this is the most
important part of the session</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because Devin may not get
a chance to meet her personally.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She may only respond to
a video that he's put together.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We're going to measure
your second by second reaction</font>

<font face="Merriweather">which is what Secretary Rice
would have as watching this video.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Love discs are love
letters in music and pictures.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Dude, â€œlove discâ€ doesn't work.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Look at that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- [laughter in background]
Look at that response.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter in background]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's as low as it gets.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm sorry.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Wow.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I mean that's lower than when
Bill Clinton used the phrase,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"It depends on
the meaning of the word 'is' is."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want a word or phrase
to describe Devin</font>

<font face="Merriweather">based on what you saw.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We're going to start in the front.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Potential Cyrano de Bergerac.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Terrible.
Sad.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Uh, very sad, desperate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Embarrassing.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I thought it was
sweet and genuine.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He's not my type.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It is a little unfortunate that
most people are very shallow</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and will be put off by his
clear physical deficiencies.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[laughter]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What exactly do you mean by that?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- [laughter]
Sideburns, his sideburns.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sideburns?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How many of you would keep
the sideburns, raise your hands?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How many of you would
take them off?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Overwhelming.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want you to put your dials
as to what you thought of Devin</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at the end of that video.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Give him a rating
between zero and 100.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now I want you to take
a look at the new Devin.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Wow.
Very nice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now give him a rating.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Laura what's the rating
for men and women now?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">48/66.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Women are at 66.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">How many women went up
based on looking at him now?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There you go.
Why?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Why'd you go up?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">He looks great in a suit.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Looks more serious
and respectable.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thank you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She likes clean-shaven men.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The sideburns have to go.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She would never look at you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The only thing that's
stopping me right now is me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[dramatic music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[dramatic music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Ahhh!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[dramatic music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Nothing of value is really
ever won without sacrifice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[Sombre dramatic music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[Sombre music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">A rebirth...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a re-Genesis.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">A lot of people will tell
you that Rice was weak</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she was too weak
to be National Security Adviser</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when she had these
titans on either side,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">uh, Rumsfeld and Cheney on
one side, and Powell on the other.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Probably three
of the best bureaucrats</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that have ever worked the system.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Huge egos.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Much more experience than she had</font>

<font face="Merriweather">particularly in national security
issues and foreign policy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So I think what you see
is when she realizes</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that she can't beat Dick Cheney
or Donald Rumsfeld,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she learns how
to maneuver around them.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She decided to use her personal
relationship with the president</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to gain power inside
the Administration.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Rice's relationship
with President Bush is very close.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She goes to Camp David a lot.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She stays in the main
house at Crawford.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">So it is a very
unusual relationship</font>

<font face="Merriweather">between the President
and his National Security Adviser.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, there's a famous
story about how, uh,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice
and George W. Bush are in the U.N</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the General Assembly</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and he actually passed
a little note to Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What the note said was,
"Can I go to the bathroom?"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You have
a President of United States,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the most powerful man in the world</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who literally would
not go to the bathroom</font>

<font face="Merriweather">without asking permission
of Condoleezza Rice.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is not a woman who
thinks in seconds or minutes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is a woman
who thinks in decades.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she came to this conclusion
very early and she said,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"Well, I build my intimacy
with the president.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I become a very close
confidant of the president.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I build my power
and my eyeâ€™s on the prize.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If I do this,
I'll be the next Secretary of State."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">On to the White House.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cometh the hour, cometh the Man.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I am that Man.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The climax of all of our struggles.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Inside there
is where it all happens.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[cheering]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is grassroots

<font face="Merriweather">- Hi. Devin?
Hi.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- Yes.
I'm Tracy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Tracy, nice to meet you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay, take positions, please.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll be standing there</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When you're on the world stage</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Standing there

when you're standing tall</font>

I'll always be on callâ€¦</font>

  When I'm in DC.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condi, you mean,
you mean the world to meâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cause you're my
Condi Condoleezza once,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And you're my Condi
Condoleezza twice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Cause you're my
Condi Condoleezza true,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There's nothing I won't do</font>

<font face="Merriweather">For Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[buzzer]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We're trying to deliver
this to the Secretary of State.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know, she doesn't work here,
she's the Secretary of State.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is the White House.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Being in love is very
close to being insane.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I ask you, Dr. Rice,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">whether you recall
the title of that PDB.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe the title was:</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"Bin Laden Determined To
Attack Inside The United States."</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The August 6 presidential
daily brief was one of dozens</font>

<font face="Merriweather">scores of intelligence reports
that reached the White House</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in the spring and summer
of 2001 about terrorist threats.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The CIA, George Tenet
and Richard Clark,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice's
counterterrorism director</font>

<font face="Merriweather">were really banging
on the door every day.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Her door every day saying,
â€œthere is this dire threat.â€</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I cannot tell you that there might
not have been a report here</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or a report there that reached
somebody in our midst.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She acknowledged
that she couldn't recall whether</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she had discussed</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the presence of Al-Qaeda
cells in the United States</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with President Bush.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Condoleezza Rice
was the gatekeeper.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She was the person who
determined what information</font>

<font face="Merriweather">got into the president.
It was a pivotal role.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I just don't buy the argument
that we weren't shaking</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the trees enough and that
something was going to fall out</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that gave us somehow
that little piece of information</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that would have led
to connecting all of those dots.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Had photographs
of Midhar and Al-Hosni</font>

<font face="Merriweather">been put on television,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">would they have come to
the airports on September 11th?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There were people on
the 9/11 Commission and on staff</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who would tell you it was both
incompetence and negligence.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">9/11 was such a dramatic,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">terrible, horrible event,
it forced her to reevaluate</font>

<font face="Merriweather">things that she had
thought were true before.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">More idealistic than
she had been before.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">There are critics who say
that there was a Condi before 9/11</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and a Neo-Condi after 9/11.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe what happened with
Condoleezza Rice after 9/11</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was that we saw a Realist
transform into an Idealist.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This thing that Josef Korbel
had had such an important role</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in sculpting in Rice's
own head came apart</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she found
George W. Bush's idealism.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We go forward to defend Freedom</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and all that is good
and just in our world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't have a good
feeling about this.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Isn't this a little stalker-ish?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's gonna be fine.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay. Here we go.
Let's break into the Watergate.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You sure this is a good idea?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sure, it's a good idea.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We've got to get into her world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have a package to deliver
to a resident here under â€œRiceâ€.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Okay.
I'll call them.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thank you.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Um, we have come
with a gift for Secretary Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and was wondering if we
could give a, er, gift.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's a-- some cake for her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">No, but I need to ask you
to leave right now though.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We tried.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Oh, look, there's Security.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Shall I try with the Security services?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Maybe that's not the best
thing to do, Sebastian.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'll be over there,
away from Security.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're not allowed
to be here, okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is a love offering.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My friend is in love with
her and, uh...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I realize that.
It's very touching,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">but you can't
deliver anything here.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It has to be delivered
to the PR department, okay?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and nothing but the truth.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think the general view
of Dr. Rice's testimony</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was that she was filibustering.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think Dr. Rice was well
aware of the restrictions of time</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and was chewing up the clock</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with long and rambling discourses.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The question is what did
we need to do about that...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And fuel-filled
investigations underway...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I also understood that...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that was what the FBI was doing...
that the FBIâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think her objective was
to say as little as possible</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in as many words as possible.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I really don't remember.
I...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't remember...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I... I don't know...</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't personally remember it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Throughout the investigation
of the 9/11 Commission,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">what you saw of Condoleezza Rice,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it appeared to many
people certainly on the Commission</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was a tremendous
amount of word play.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know,
a warning was not a warning,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">intelligence wasn't
intelligence unless she said it was.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She relies on this word-play
to the point of being dishonest.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This study has found that you,
Madam Secretary,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">made 56 false statements
to the American people.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Isn't it true
that you had intelligence</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that cast doubt on
your repeated claims</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that Iraq did not have
weapons of mass destruction?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I did not at any time
make a statement</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that I knew to be false
or that I thought to be false</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in order to pump up anything.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We don't want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">None of
the intelligence community</font>

<font face="Merriweather">said that he had a nuclear bomb.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">That's really going</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a long way with that talking point</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when you're suggesting
to the American people</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that it might go off
tomorrow morning.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I do believe in Rice's mind
she doesn't believe she lied.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe that.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I believe that she
believes that, you know,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">she did what she had to do</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and if she kept some things,
uh, strategically</font>

<font face="Merriweather">absent from the public record,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think that's how
she would see it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she would see
that that's what she had to do.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She walked
in with all the credentials</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for having principles,
and in the process</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of joining that unholy
alliance for the crusade in Iraq,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think she rose above principle.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Stop telling the same lies</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Stop making the world cry</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Be who you are inside</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I'm a deeply religious person.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">My life has I think unfolded
as it was supposed to.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Let down your guard tonight</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Say you're sorry
cause it's all right</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We all make mistakes</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Who pays the price
for your decisions?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You're not gonna
pay a particular price.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want to interview
Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">when she was buying
Ferragamo shoes on Fifth Avenue</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and went to see Spamalot
when people were drowning.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Boy, would I love her to face me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What's a â€œnoble causeâ€?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Tell me as a mother.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I want to know.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[protesters shouting]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Our love, our life, our dreams
Believe. Our loveâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I do pray every day</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and in times of tragedy
and heartbreak</font>

<font face="Merriweather">like the passing of my own
parents or September 11th,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I have found solace and strength
in the power of prayer.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Believe</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[chatter and gunshots]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">On September 16, 2007,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Blackwater guards who were
working for the State Department</font>

<font face="Merriweather">opened fire in
the Central Square in Baghdad.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Witnesses say
that the guards did this</font>

<font face="Merriweather">even though
the attack was unprovoked.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">One of the armored cars hit my car</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so I opened the door</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and drop myself in the street,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because I thought they are--</font>

<font face="Merriweather">they wanted to kill me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What resulted in that day was
the death of 17 Iraqi civilians.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">...I would remind
that this is a war zone</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that it is true that sometimes,
uh, incidents happened.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The State Department then
offered ten thousand dollars</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to the families of the victims</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in exchange
for an agreement not to sue.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I told them I refused
to accept any compensation.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">First, I want the court system
to have the final word.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">In this war zone
I don't think that people</font>

<font face="Merriweather">- have been either reckless...
[gunshots]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Jesus Christ,
it's like a fucking turkey shoot.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">...Nor have they been trying
somehow to shield people</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in this circumstance.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Secretary Rice granted
immunity to these contractors</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for prosecution
in the United States.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Essentially,
pardoned these crimes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The way that the State Department</font>

<font face="Merriweather">responded to this</font>

<font face="Merriweather">was to renew
a contract with Blackwater.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">We would like to get
appropriate legislation</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that speaks to the prosecution
of civilian contract personnel.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Well, I'm the sponsor of the only
bill I know in the House</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that has dealt with this,
uh, issue</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and she nor her staff has
ever talked with me or my staff.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think it contradicts our values.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It makes us out to be hypocrites.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It compromises our mission.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It puts our military
personnel in jeopardy.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">People make little distinction
between American troops</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and American private contractors.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">What if another incident occurs,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">what if there's another
shootout in the middle of Baghdad?</font>

<font face="Merriweather">This is reckless.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">All I can see
is a dereliction of duty.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Virtually any level
you'd want to assess this,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">it's a disaster for our country.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[music]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[fire crackling]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The United States does not permit,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">tolerate or condone torture
under any circumstances.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">After Abu Ghraib broke,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">after the photographs
shocked the world,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the CIA was still pushing</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for interrogations
and the use of torture</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of specific detainees
and this group continued to meet</font>

<font face="Merriweather">with Condoleezza Rice
chairing the group.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She sat in the White House
with these torture meetings</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and decided what torture
to use on what person.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">These "enhanced
interrogation methods"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">included waterboarding,
fingernail extraction</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and sleep deprivation.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">And then the combination of those,
how often they could be used,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">could they be used
together with each other,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the CIA would come in
and give a presentation</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of what they wanted to do,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to the point where
they were choreographing</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the interrogations and the torture</font>

<font face="Merriweather">from the basement
of the White House itself.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">According to White House insiders,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Rice signed off
on these techniques</font>

<font face="Merriweather">by instructing the official,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">"This is your baby, go do it!"</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Let me try to be clear,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the United States doesn't
and can't condone torture.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I've talked to other people who've
said that there was an effort</font>

<font face="Merriweather">made to try to keep the president</font>

<font face="Merriweather">somewhat isolated
from these decisions,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">because they were so
concerned about the possibility</font>

<font face="Merriweather">of the president being
impeached someday.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They knew that what
they were doing was illegal.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">They knew what they were doing</font>

<font face="Merriweather">would bring shame to the world
if the world found out about it.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The United States does not
transport and has not transported</font>

<font face="Merriweather">detainees from
one country to another</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for the purpose
of interrogation using torture.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If you try to think about
American foreign policy</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and that there are secret
sites to which people are sent</font>

<font face="Merriweather">to be tortured
and that there are innocents like</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Maher Arar who's
a Syrian Canadian engineer</font>

<font face="Merriweather">who was sent to Syria
to be tortured</font>

<font face="Merriweather">in a coffin-sized cell for a year.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When I was not being beaten,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I was put in a waiting room</font>

<font face="Merriweather">so that I could hear
the screams of other prisoners.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">The cries of the women
still haunt me the most.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Torture and conspiracy
to commit torture</font>

<font face="Merriweather">are crimes under U.S. law</font>

<font face="Merriweather">wherever they may occur in the world.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It is a tragic fact
that Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">has massively committed war crimes.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You can be sitting in your
office in the White House</font>

<font face="Merriweather">or the State Department, and
if you're making decisions</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that are authorizing,
ordering, facilitating</font>

<font face="Merriweather">a crime being committed,
you're responsible for that crime.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When you work
for an administration</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you do sign on and there
is a question of loyalty</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and then every
person has to decide</font>

<font face="Merriweather">for himself or herself
where that line is.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You know,
how loyal are you before you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">you know, blow the whistle.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I don't think she ever understood</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the seriousness of what it meant
to become as powerful as she is.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If Jesus Christ were
speaking to Condi Rice,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think he would say that the idea</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that you're saving
tens of thousands of lives</font>

<font face="Merriweather">by torturing someoneâ€¦</font>

<font face="Merriweather">the one doesn't weigh
more than the other.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">If you do it to the least
of these you do it unto Me.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">[glass shatters]</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think John Rice
would have been appalled.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think Americans
should be appalled</font>

<font face="Merriweather">that Dr. Rice was sitting there</font>

<font face="Merriweather">giving the authority
to waterboard.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">â€œWar criminal! Take her to the Hague!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I think Josef Korbel would
turn over in his grave</font>

<font face="Merriweather">at what Condoleezza Rice</font>

<font face="Merriweather">and the Bush
administration have done.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">She has now done real horrors.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">When I first saw you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">You slipped into my dreams,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Too pure, I melted for you,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Thought everything
you told me was true</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now I see what's really real</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sheâ€™s a liar, a cheater,
a two-faced deceiver,</font>

<font face="Merriweather">I saw what she did,
yet I still believed her.</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Now it's time to pay the price</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Stand up and be judged</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Sentenced by your fears</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Accused by all the drowning ones</font>

<font face="Merriweather">It's time to pay the price</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Pay the price!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Pay the price!</font>

<font face="Merriweather">Pay the price!</font>
