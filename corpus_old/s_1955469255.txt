Was it the holidays?

Uh, it wasn't that.

Well, then why'd you
decide to come in tonight?

Um...

I'm trying to fix my mind.

Howard is a brilliant man.

And he's not just a boss,
he's a friend.

He lost his child, and now he doesn't care
if he loses everything else.

This might be the strangest thing
I have ever come across.

He writes letters.

Who are they to?

Howard doesn't write letters to people.
He writes to things.

"Time". "Love". "Death".

Kids write letters to Santa Claus.
It doesn't mean they're crazy.

No, this is therapeutic.

You're gonna think I'm crazy,
but I'm having conversations.

"Death" came first.
She met me in the dog park.

Charmed, I'm sure.

So "Death" is a her.

Turns out "Death"
is an elderly white woman.

Remember me?
I'm "Time".

You wrote me because you need me.

Howard...

Ask her. Go ahead.
Ask her if she can see me.

He was sitting right here.

And he just appeared, right?

I'm "Love".

And I'm the fabric of life.

Something's starting to happen to you.

Howard?

I don't know what to do
to bring you back.

What if "Love", "Death", and "Time"
are trying to help you?

You need to talk to them, Howard.

Challenge them.
Just engage.

"Love" is the reason for everything.

I felt you everyday
when she laughed.

And you broke my heart.

I was there in her laugh,
but I'm also here now in your pain.

He's reaching out
to the cosmos for answers.

Just be sure to notice
the collateral beauty

Its the profound connection to everything.

If he accepts that,
maybe he gets to find his life again.

You're not here to take me, are you?

No, Howard.
I'm here to ride the F train with you.
