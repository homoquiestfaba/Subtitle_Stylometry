Oh, my God.

Oh, Frank, thank God.

I'm dead.

Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.
This town is so confusing.

There's Connecticut,
Vermont, Massachusetts...

Man, what a day.

My wife had to work early,
so I took my kid to his new school.

He won't stop crying.

Says he wants
to move back to Chicago.

It broke my heart.

Any more excuses?

Good.

When you work with me,
you be punctual.

You got it?

I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

Come on.
Frank, how you doing?

Marty.
Good to see you again.

Sorry we were late.

Al, could you go downstairs
and help out Jimmy and Raul?

Please?
Yeah, sure.

Appreciate it.
This is his.

Hi, you guys.

You don't trust me.
I live in a crappy neighborhood.

Yeah?

Got that funny money?
Yeah.

Right here.

Looks good.
Looks real good.

We're in business.
Excellent.

There’s just one problem.

This guy Al keeps asking me questions
about my counterfeiter.

Really?
He asked too many questions.

My instinct usually tells me
when there's something wrong.

There's something wrong here,
so I had him followed.

He's a fucking Secret Service agent.

What do you think I ought to do?

Make sure the body
doesn't wash up on shore.

I want you to pop him for me.

I think maybe you’re with him.

You came to me, remember?

So pop him.
Show me I'm an asshole.

I'm just a businessman.

So pop him...

and let's do some business.

Yes, that's what
I'm looking for.

Let's go get an omelet.
You like omelets?

I know a good place.
We'll have chili and cheese.

Let me get my pistoli.

My gun.

You're under arrest.

You're under arrest too.

Secret Service.

You knew the gun was empty, right?

You knew from the weight
of the gun...

that the chamber was empty?

There could have been one bullet.
Oh, my God.

Do you think we can go someplace
and talk about this?

You killed guys before?

Does it get to you?
It gets to you.

I don't know if I'm cut out
for this undercover stuff.

I was so scared.

You know, I joined
the Secret Service because...

I always wanted
to protect people.

The idea of throwing yourself
in front of a gun...

hoping the bullet hits you instead
of the guy you’re protecting...

You find that appealing?

I don't know.

Maybe I'm...

Maybe I'm just wrong
for the job.

You're a good man.
You'll make a good agent.

How do you know? This is
the longest conversation we ever had.

I know things about people.

Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

I want to go home,
hug my wife and kid.

A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

And they were right.

I'll see you in the office.
Damn. The office.

Monroe wanted us
to check out some wacko.

I'll take care of it.
I'll go with you.

You go home,
hug your wife and kid.

Lam not nosy lady.

I don't snoop,
but smoke alarm was going off.

I get scared.

I get more scared when I see
what is there inside.

Smoke was from crumbs
in oven left on.

Thirty-one years
I'm in this country.

I love United States.

I go to White House.

Only United States
can just anybody go...

to the house
of the president to visit.

So when I see this...

these killing things...

I call police.

They say they call Secret Service.

But two days,
you don't come.

The president gets approximately
1,400 threats a year, ma'am.

We have to check them all.

You say this fellow's name
is McCauley?

No, Joseph McCrawley
from Denver, Colorado.

I still remember like yesterday.

I cry and cry.

Joseph McCrawley of Denver,
right?

That's right.

Died over 30 years ago, age 11.

Your guy must have got himself
a duplicate birth certificate...

then used it
to get a driver's license.

Thanks, Jack.
See you.

Federal agents.
Open up.

Ma'am.

Oh, my God.

That's you.

Yeah.

Frank Horrigan?

Yeah.

The Secret Service agent?

Yeah, what did I win?

My God, it's really you?

Who the hell is this?

That was you
in my apartment last night.

McCrawley?

Why not call me Booth?

Why not Oswald?

Because Booth had flair,
panache...

the leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln.

Where are you?
Closer than you might imagine.

It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.

How's that?

I've read about you,
seen photos.

You were JFK's favorite agent,
the best and the brightest.

But that was along time ago.

What's kept you in the game
all these years?

Why don't we get together for a drink?
We could talk about that.

I’d love to, but the less
you know about me the better.

Why?
I’m planning to kill the president.

You shouldn't have said that.

It's a federal offense
to threaten the president.

You could go to jail
even if you don't mean it.

I mean it, all right.

John F. Kennedy said
all someone needs is a willingness...

to trade his life
for the president's.

Right?
That's right.

I'm willing.

Going up against you...

raises the game
to a much higher level.

Fate has brought us together.

I just can't
get over the irony.

What irony?

You being intimately involved...

with the assassinations
of two presidents.

Hang on a second.
I got something on the stove.

He was only in the building
for three weeks.

He came and left at odd hours.

What's really weird is that the other
tenants noticed him on the stairs...

but never really saw him.

Depending on who you talk to
he was between 5'8"and 6'2"...

between 165 and 180 pounds.

Age?
Between 28 and 45.

Two months before an election,
you get panic on a good day.

They've been waiting for you.
Sam.

Been a long time
since you’ve been over here.

I hear the new director
isn't much fun.

I've been the director for two years.
Yeah.

Al D'Andrea.
Director.

You know Matt Wilder?
Yeah.

He still owes me 20 bucks
from Super Bowl XXI.

He always liked Denver.

This is Agent-in-Charge
Bill Watts.

And Lilly Raines.
Hello.

Secretaries get prettier
and prettier around here.

And the field agents
get older and older.

Lilly's an agent.

I knew that. I just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

I guess we're calling him Booth?
Yeah.

What do you know about him?
Well, he's dangerous.

How do you know?
I know things about people.

Why didn’t you take
appropriate steps...

to know more that first night?

We had a busy day, Bill.

Too busy to investigate properly?

Your report says you were only
in the room ten minutes.

I didn't have a warrant.

Given your reputation
for undercover work...

What reputation are you talking about?
Let's get back on track.

What's he referring to?
Let's drop it.

Am I being paranoid
or is he busting my balls?

Probably a little of both.

Bill, there was a time around here
when I was almost as arrogant as you.

I don't have time for this.

I have to pull 75 agents
out of Miami.

Keep me posted, Sam.

What do we do with this guy?
We'll keep investigating.

Meanwhile,
you could have my phone tapped.

What makes you think he'll call again?
He'll call again.

He's got panache.

"Panache"?
It means flamboyance.

I know what it means.
Really?

I had to look it up.
We'll tap your phone.

By the way, Frank...

Watts is nowhere near as arrogant
as you were when you had Kennedy's ear.

Just what reputation
was Watts referring to?

You know damn well.

Is it because I'm considered
a borderline burnout...

with questionable social skills?

What do you want to talk to me about,
besides your reputation?

I want to be assigned
to the president.

Protection?
That's right.

After all these years?
Christ, you're a dinosaur.

This guy's gonna make a try,
and I've gotta be there.

Watts would fight me tooth and nail.
Then fight him back.

You owe it to me
after 30 years of favors.

If you knew how many times
I protected your job...

I've got to come back.

You really want to stand post again,
at your age?

Yeah.

I've got at least one pair
of good shoes in the closet somewhere.

All posts, we're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

The French president's going with him.
Get a security man up here.

He's coming over here, look!

Goddamn it.

Mr. President!
Get back.

What's going on here?
Horrigan had a heart attack.

Pal, you okay?
Take it easy.

Get the hell out of here.
What the hell's going on?

I got a call
there was a cardiac case.

You all right?
Yeah, I'm on my break here.

I get it.

You bastards.

Who's the wise guy?

Everybody back to work.

All right, who was the joker
who called those guys?

It may not have been a joke.
You were looking peaked out there.

I find out who it is,
I'll pay him back in spades.

How can you be sure
it was a "him"?

You missed my street, Al.

Why don’t you have a car?

I lived in New York a lot of years.
I like public transportation.

You like buses.
That's great.

Why make me go out of my way
every night?

I like your company.

He's a weird-looking guy,
isn't he?

Yeah, if he still
looks like that.

Pull up over here.

It's a weird subculture, Al.
Yeah.

I'd like you to send some field agents
to check these things...

ask about some wackos.

Sure. First thing in the morning,
I'll get on it.

I'll talk to Jack about it.
Hang on. I got the other line.

Yeah.

How are you doing?
I'm fine, thanks.

Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of the other call.

You got it?
We got it.

Keep him on the line
till we get the ANI.

Yeah.
Trying to trace me?

Why didn't I think of that?

You did or you’re not
the adversary I'd hoped for.

Speaking of which, how are you?
I was worried about you today.

Why?
In the motorcade...

I thought you were
gonna pass out.

You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

Yeah, maybe you’re right.

By the way,
I'm watching your movie.

Movie?

November, 1963. Kennedy's last days,
the arrival in Texas.

It must have been
exciting for you.

Dallas,
that morning at Love Field.

You all look so radiant:

JFK, Jackie and you.

You look so young and able.

What did happen to you that day?

Only one agent reacted
to the gunfire...

and you were closer
to Kennedy than he was.

You must have looked up at the window
of the Texas Book Depository...

but you didn't react.

Late at night,
when the demons come...

do you see the rifle
coming out of that window...

or do you see Kennedy's head
being blown apart?

If you'd reacted
to that first shot...

could you have gotten there
in time to stop the big bullet?

If you had, that could have been
your head being blown apart.

Do you wish you'd succeeded
or is life too precious?

What's done is done.

I have that "Esquire" magazine article
on the tenth anniversary...

about you and all the other agents
that were there that day.

So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

You were so forthright
about your drinking problem...

and the fact that
you weren't easy to live with.

I was so moved by your honesty.

The world can be
a cruel place...

to an honest man.

What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

It's an epic saga.

I'll talk to you again soon.

Nice to have a friend.

Did you get him?
We got him.

Go!

Get on the floor!

Get your hands
where I can see them!

He could have a device
that manipulates the ANI...

and fakes the line's identification.

Makes it seem like
he's calling from another number.

Where would he get this device?

He could build one if he were
knowledgeable in digital circuitry.

But you can't trace the call.
You can run a parity check.

If his line is wired
for digital switches.

You can trace the call?

Not if it's an old,
twisted-pair, analog line.

Damn it, Jack,
give a straight answer...

or my partner
will shoot off his foot.

He calls again,
you keep him on the line.

We'll see what we can do.
Right, Tony?

You might suggest to the police that
they don't knock down any more doors.

I'm intrigued,
but why play it for me?

We'd like you to consider canceling
the president's dinner tomorrow.

The state dinner,
at the French embassy?

Do you know how long it took to line up
this trip this close to the election?

This guy's manipulated
the phone system.

If he has a knowledge of explosives,
there could be problems.

Do your job,
there won't be any problems.

It's not that hard to smuggle weapons
inside an embassy.

You think the French want to knock off
the president? Are you nuts?

They love him.
Why does every chief of staff...

You have no reason to believe
this guy is any more dangerous...

than thousands of others
who make idle threats...

but you want me to alter the itinerary
of the world's most powerful man...

and risk offending
40 million French.

Isn't it possible this guy
has pushed some buttons in you?

Maybe you’re overreacting a little.

I'm just trying
to protect your boss, damn it.

So am I. We're trailing 12 points
in the latest polls.

He could be out of a job
in six weeks.

He's got to be seen.
Even if it kills him?

Next order of business?

How could being a dozen points down
look like good news?

The president
was even worse off weeks ago.

His aides will keep him out
with the voters as much as they can...

especially in the midwest.

Then an all-important swing
through California.

Ladies and gentlemen...

the President and the First Lady
of the United States...

and His Excellency,
the President of France, and his wife.

Agent Raines, you look devastating.
Thank you.

Good enough to eat, I might add,
if you’ll pardon the expression.

Every time I start
to sympathize with you...

you say something
that really annoys me.

Why sympathize?

The tape of that phone call,
when he mentioned your wife.

Ex-wife.

At any rate, I'm sorry.

It's strange that the only sympathy
I get these days...

is from a would-be assassin
or a woman I tend to annoy.

Would you care to dance?

Perhaps some other time.

I get off in a couple hours.

What are you looking at?

I was wondering
where you hide your firearm.

Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

We're on final approach
to Los Angeles.

The temperature isabalmy76degrees.
It's a beautiful day out there.

Thanks for flying with us.
We look forward to seeing you again.

I'd like to deposit this
in the new account.

I'll need to see
your corporate resolutions.

Microspan Corporation.

What kind of business are you in?
Software.

Up in San Jose.
Yes.

Based there, but I'm opening
an office here in Los Angeles.

I like San Jose.

Are you from there?
No.

Where are you from?
Minneapolis.

You're kidding.
So am I.

Wow, it's a small world.

I hated the winters.

Nine months of the year
I'd stay indoors and pig out.

I moved here and have lost
30 pounds so far.

What high school did you go to?
New Brighton High School.

There isn't any
New Brighton High School.

There was when I was there.

Maybe I'm just confused.

It happens a lot.

What was the name of that high school
on Third just across from...

I'm sorry, but I'm very late
for a meeting. Will this take long?

Not at all.
Just another minute.

Thank you.

You have a very pleasant way
about you.

Thank you, Mr. Carney.

Agent Raines, how would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

Why do you keep flirting with me?

Am I flirting with you?

You know it can't possibly go anywhere,
so why keep doing it?

Maybe it's because I know
it can't possibly go anywhere.

Give me a lift.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

No further obligations.

Oh, boy.

I’ve never worked
with a female agent before.

How many are there?
About 125.

Pure window dressing.
Excuse me?

Window dressing.

About 125
out of a little over 2,000.

They have you all around
so the president can look good...

to his feminist voters.

Do you make an effort
to be obnoxious or is it a gift?

It's a gift.

Half the things we do
are window dressing.

Take running alongside
that limousine.

It'd take an antitank missile
to put a dent in that damn thing.

There we are out for show...

trying to make the president
look more presidential.

If I'm here to court
the feminist vote...

what demographics
do you represent?

Let's see.

White, piano-playing heterosexuals
over the age of50.

There ain't a whole lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

Well, time flies
when you're being annoyed.

Where are you going?
I have a date.

With whom?
That's none of your business.

You want a ride?

I don't think so.

I like it here this time of day.
I'll hang out.

Thanks for the ice cream.
See you.

You're welcome.

If she looks back,
that means she's interested.

Come on now,
give me a little look.

One little glance back.

Give me that smug look
and be on your way.

Well, Abe...

Damn, I wish I could have
been there for you, pal.

Hi, baby.
How are you doing?

Come on up here. Give me a kiss.
That's a good boy.

Yes, I missed you too.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

I got your address from the phone book.
But I'm not listed.

Uh-oh.
I suppose I better come clean.

I followed you.

I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.

I'm new in town.

I was wondering if you would care
to join me for dinner tonight.

That's very sweet, but I...

And I also wanted to apologize
for lying to you this afternoon.

We both know
I'm not from Minneapolis.

I shouldn't ask so many questions.

Did you mention
our conversation...

to anyone at the bank
this afternoon?

May I?

Rory, settle down!

Pam, what's going on?
Hi.

This is my roommate.
Sally, this is Mr. Carney.

Call me Jim.
How do you do?

Nice to meet you.
I was just on my way out.

I'm afraid I can't let you ladies
leave this evening.

What?

You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

Look, I don't know
what you want, but...

Hi, this is Sally.
And this is Pam.

We're either out having fun
or we're asleep.

So leave your name and number
and we’ll call you back.

Bye.

Frank, I hope you don't mind me
calling you at the office.

I was in the neighborhood.

No, why don't you drop by?

I’d love to.

Let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

I’d love to drop by.
I'd like it a lot.

We've got so much in common.

We do? Like what?

We’re both willing to trade
our lives for the president.

We're both honest
and capable men...

who were betrayed
by people we trusted.

I wasn't betrayed, Booth.
Sure you were.

The Warren Commission's report
on the assassination...

They called your procedure
"seriously deficient".

They criticized you
and the other agents...

who were out drinking late
the night before...

as though Kennedy would be a live today
if you'd been in bed at 10:00 p.m.

That's ludicrous.

Maybe they were right.

As a matter of fact,
they weren't right.

You wanted to station agents
on his bumpers and sideboards.

He refused. Do you know why
I think he refused?

I think he refused
because he had a death wish.

He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

His favorite poem was
"I Have a Rendezvous with Death"...

which is not a good poem.

I think he wanted to die.

I think he didn’t care that his death
would ruin your life.

I think he was a selfish bastard.

But what do you think?

What about you?
Who betrayed you?

I don't think he's scrambling it.

Some of the same people.

But I'm gonna get even.
I’ll have my day in the sun.

The question is:
Will you have yours?

It's coming.
You're in for a lot more pain.

How much of this shit
do I have to listen to?

Jesus!

He's right across the street:
Lafayette Park. Keep him on.

Are you guys crazy?

Do you see somebody over there?

I told you to get in shape.

This is your current address?

And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

That's him.

Secret Service.
I'm impounding this car.

He put his hand down here.
We got fingerprints.

You all right?

Tony.
Yeah?

Have a look at this.

This the print from Secret Service?
Yeah.

Something strange here.

Shit. It's a C-12.
We can't tell them.

I'm afraid that we've drawn a blank.
You sure?

We ran that print
against everything we've got.

What do we do now?

I'm leaving with the president
in the morning.

You keep investigating.
What should I do?

You're an adult human being.
Think of something.

You're a real pain in the ass
when things don't go your way.

Your friends warned you about that.

The president
hit the campaign trail today.

He left
from Andrews Air Force Base...

on a whirlwind tour of 12 states
over the next six days.

With just over a month to go
before the election...

the president is trailing
his opponent by ten points.

To close that gap, he’ll concentrate
his campaign efforts in the midwest...

where he's sagging in the polls.

The campaign swing will windup
in Chicago with a big rally.

The president’s campaign staff
is hopeful that by that time...

Reservations, Donna Lynn.
May I help you?

I'm calling to find out when
you would have a flight on Tuesday...

from Washington to Los Angeles?

All right.

If possible, I'd like to get
an open-ended ticket...

because I may have to make some stops
in the midwest on my return.

Denver Command Post, C-5 Agents.

We'll off-load the choppers first.
Who's our route agent?

C-5Agent,
that will be Jack McKeen.

Denver Command Post, Watts.
We have arrival: 1315.

C-5Agent, where are we keeping
these cars secured?

Denver Police Department
has a fenced area for us.

Security Room, Watts.
We're ten minutes out. Situation report.

Here in Denver, we gather today
in the shadow of giants:

Brave pioneers who overcame
terrifying obstacles...

to carve a new nation
from a wilderness.

Today we are asked to match
our vision to their vision...

and to pass that legacy
of a boundless...

Horrigan to I D.
Sector three secured?

Sector three is secure.

A legacy of tolerance...

The president campaigning today
in Denver.

Here in Washington this afternoon,
the Senate again delayed action...

We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

of peace and progress
for every American.

That was the president
stumping in Nebraska today.

He's due to arrive here in Los Angeles
later in the month...

to compete for California’s crucial
54 electoral votes.

Hi, Sandy Riggs calling
for James Carney.

If you're serious
about trying to catch a rally...

while you’re in the midwest,
you best call me.

The president's schedule changes
hour by hour.

In answer
to your other question...

just send a check here
to party headquarters.

Thanks again.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

Ladies and gentlemen
of Holland, Michigan...

the President
of the United States!

We've gone a long way
toward achieving that goal...

but there's a lot left to do.

Watts, Flynn. We got some trouble
on the tracks up ahead.

You better notify
the White House staff.

Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
We've only got one site.

May I have your attention, please?

Flight318 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at Gate 21.

Please have
your boarding passes ready.

All passengers should proceed
to the boarding area now.

Checking.

Found any bombs today?

Agent Raines.
Agent Horrigan.

How's the first lady?
Did she ask about me?

Have you gotten to know them yet?

I prefer not to get to know
the people I'm protecting.

Why is that?

You might decide they're
not worth taking a bullet for.

Here comes my replacement.

Care to join me in the bar?
We can't drink on the road.

Of course not, but they've got
a hell of a piano player.

I've played for presidents,
and I've played with presidents.

Nixon and I once did
a halfway decent duet of "Moon glow".

I heard he didn't like you.

That's not true.
We got on all right.

His chief of staff
was another matter.

Once at a rally in Boston...

he ordered me to get rid
of some antiwar protesters.

I said I couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech, that kind of stuff.

He said, "When I'm talking to you,
I am the president".

And I said, "You look more like
a sack of shit in a cheap suit, sir".

I like the "sir".
It's a classy touch.

I thought so.
Mm-hmm.

So how come you never wear shades
standing post?

I like the wackos to see
the whites of my eyes.

A good glare can be
just as effective as a gun.

Know what I mean?
Yeah.

You got me.

You better stick
to the shades, sweetheart.

Agent Raines,
what are you afraid of?

Afraid of making a big mistake.

Good night.

We're looking at this route
to the hospital...

Oh, good.

We've got some updates
on Milwaukee tomorrow.

Thanks.

Call Advance and see
if we can get a backup route.

Don't answer it.
Shit.

Traveler's lost ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's off.

They're staging a rally outside Atlanta
in a town called Woodstock.

We need you down at Communications,
right away.

I'll be right down.

Traveler's losing ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta.

Damn.

Oh, dear.

What am I doing?

Shit. Ow.

Oh, boy.

Damn.

I gotta put all that shit back on,
goddamn it.

Please open your purses
for inspection.

You don't know how glad I am to see you
all out in the rain with me today.

I've been going around saying...

"Don’t just vote for me,
join me".

Today you certainly have.

We may feel a tad damp today...

but guess who’s going to be all wet
on election day?

What about the watch list?

I've got 23 regional crazies
under surveillance.

Chicago intelligence has nine more.

The hospital?
St. Ann's.

Extra units of Traveler's
blood type on hand.

Accessible to that
alternative route as well.

ETA Chicago: Ten minutes.

Under the weather?
Sick as a dog.

Yeah? What's this?

"Psychological Profile
of John Booth".

Did you make a mistake?
What?

You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

Let's be realistic. This job
is not like we work in a bank.

You had an affair with an agent,
and it came out badly.

He wasn't an agent.

He left you because you wouldn't quit.
You were brokenhearted.

I left him because I wouldn't
quit my job for him.

It did break my heart.

You vowed to never let a man
come between you and your career.

Except now you’re in love with me,
and it scares you a little.

Blow your nose. Here.

Sorry.

What were to happen
if I gave up my job for you?

Why would you do that?

Maybe I vowed
to never let my career...

come between me and a woman.

Yeah?
Be careful, will you?

This whole event tonight has been
advertised in advance. Just be alert.

This is Horrigan.
It's a zoo out here.

It's not very secure.
We've got to take Traveler underground.

All posts, this is Watts.

We're using the alternate
arrival site: Underground.

Horrigan to Watts.
I think Booth may be here.

I thought
you couldn't identify him.

I can't.
Just call it a hunch.

With all due respect to your psychic
abilities, we’ll stick to the game plan.

All posts, take your positions.

You've got a fever.
Just stay alert in there.

There is one quality above all
that marks this president.

It has earned him the affection
of every working man and woman.

Give us our president!
That quality is courage!

The question to us is:

Will we stand by the man...

who has stood by us?

Post check. Stage right?
Stage right all clear.

Stage left?
Stage left clear.

Stage center?
Stage center clear.

Mezzanine left?
Mezzanine left all clear.

The President of the United States
and the First Lady.

Gun!

Get down!

Get these people
out of here!

Hold all radio traffic.

Security room.
What the hell's going on in there?

I'm all clear.

False alarm.

Traveler's secure.
All posts resume positions.

You all right, Mr. President?
I'm all right.

Everything's all right, folks.
Everything will be just fine.

We had a little false alarm there.

Wasn't that exciting?

Take your seats, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

Security Room, Raines.

It was just a balloon popping.
All clear.

Traveler wants to continue.

Do you have any idea
how many votes you cost us last night?

The president came off looking
like a coward on national television.

He came off all right.

You were the one that
looked like the damn coward.

This is a joke to you?

No, you're a joke to me, Harry.

You have no idea what we do here.
That's enough!

You call me Harry again, you'll be
busting counterfeiters in Alaska.

You keep him away from the president,
away from the White House...

and you sure better
keep him away from me!

You don't talk
to the chief of staff like that!

I don't work for him.
No, you work for me. You did.

You're off my detail.

My Super Bowl debt.

In case I don't see you
after this trip.

You know, if you were just
to acknowledge...

that it was
an unfortunate situation...

I won't apologize
for doing my job.

I'm not saying you should...

but the president was humiliated.

He's alive, isn't he?

We're here to safeguard
his dignity as well.

I'm not paid for that.

What about the time Kennedy's girlfriend
was caught in the White House...

and you said she was with you?

Don't believe every rumor
someone tells you.

Wilder told me
the whole story...

about how you were
suspended a month without pay.

I'd say that was
safeguarding his dignity.

That was different.
He was different.

Maybe you were different.

I was different.

The whole damn country was different.

Everything would be different
right now too...

if I'd been half as paranoid
as I am today.

Fuck.

Why not just retire, Frank?

Live off your pension.

I mean, what's the point?

Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

Hell, you don't spend any money
on anything except jazz records.

I want to stay
on the Booth case.

All right.

As for protective detail, I can't...
I understand.

That thing in Chicago...
I just don't understand.

I've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment call like that.

You had the flu,
for Christ's sake.

It's been known
to impair judgment.

Face it.

You're too old for this shit.

Hello.
What happened in the Windy City?

The balloon get you
in a little panic?

You were there?
Yes, I was.
