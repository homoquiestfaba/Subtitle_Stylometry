All were transported?

Almost.

Almost.

Sir with all the respect,
you sure this is the best option?

Why dont we
just correct...

Because my faking nephew...

Killed the dog.

He stole a car.

A car...

Which currently is
among our inventory.

So, we are giving
everything up... for a car?

Its not just a car...

It is John Wick car.

So... why just dont give it back?

He killed my nephew.

My brother.

A dozen of my men.

Over his car.

And a puppy.

You think he will stop now?

Sir, he is one man.

Why we just eliminate him?

John Wick...

Is a man on focus...

Commitment...

And a faking will!

He once killed three
men in a bar...

With a pencil.
I know. I've heard the story.

With a faking Pencil!

Who the fak can do that?

I can assure you...

That the stories you
hear about this man...

if nothing else,
has been ###### down.

You have my car...

THE BOOGEYMAN.

Peace.

Can a man like you know peace?

Why not?

Peace.

Enjoy your retirement...

Mr. Wick.

Good dog.

<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

<i>Looking at you.</i>

<i>- What are you doing?
I'm waiting for you.</i>

<i>Come here.</i>

Hey, boy.

Nice peaceful place you got here.

Hey, Aurelio.
Hey.

John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

What do you think?

The motor is about to fall out...

The chassis is all bent up...

The drive shaft is all destroyed.

And I dont know if you noticed,
but you have a crack in the windshield.

I mean...
what do I think?

I can fix it.

Thank for finding her.

Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls.

Not a big deal.

Let me know when its fixed.

Alright.

This car will be ready by Christmas...

20th-30th

Ciao, John.

Santino.

May I come in?

Of course.

Coffee?

Grazie.

Good to see you.

Good to see... you.

I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.

Thank you.

And the dog...
Does he have a name?

No.

Listen, John...

with all sincerity...

I do not want to be here.

Please... dont.

I'm asking you not to do this.

I'm sorry.

No one...

Gets out and comes back...

without repercussions.

I did this with a heavy heart, John.

But remember...

If not for what they did...

on the night,
of your impossible task...

You would not be here right now,
like this.

This... is because of me.

This in part is mine.

Take it back.

Take it back?
Take it back.

A marker is not a simple thing, John.

For a man to grand a
mark on to another...

It's the bind of
soul and blood oath.

Find someone else.

Listen to me!

What is it?

Do you remember?

This is your blood.

You came to me.

I helped you.

If you dont do this...

You know the consequences.

I'm not that guy anymore.

You're always that guy, John.

I cant help you.

I'm sorry.

Yes.
You're right.

You cant.

But he can.

See you soon, John.

You have a beautiful home, John.

I would like to
see the manager.

How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

Shall I announce you?

Yes please.

Stay.

Mr. Wick is on his way
to see you, sir.

Impeccable.

Put this in the circulation.

Where is he?

Thank you my friend.

Beautiful work.

What are you doing, Jonathan?

He burnt my house.

You rejected his mark.
You're lucky he stopped there.

What the hell were you thinking?

Giving a mark to a man
as Santino D'Antonio?

He was the only way
I could get out.

You call this out?

What did you think
was gonna happen?

What did you expect?

Did you really think this
day was never going to come?

What does he want you to do?

I did not ask.

I just said no.

Two rules that cannot be broken,
Jonathan.

No blood on Continental grounds,

and every marker
must be honored.

My judgment come in the full
move of ex-communicado...

The high table...

they had their traditions
if you refuse...

I have no choice?

You dishonored the mark, you die.

You kill the owner of the mark,
you die.

You run, you die.

This is what you've agreed to, Jonathan.

Do what ever he asks.

Be free.

Then, if you want to go after him...

Burn his house down...

Be my guest.
But until then...

Rules!

Exactly.
Rules.

Without them,
we would live with the animals.

Do you take animals?

I am sorry to say that,

but this facility does not!

I however... would be willing
to accept the responsibility...

As you wish.

Appreciate that.

Does he have a name, sir?

No.

Good dog.

Stay.

This was my fathers collection.

I see a little more, not that
just paint on canvas of course.

But I do find myself here.

Please...

I didnt want you to do this,
John.

If you had retired...

I would've respected it.

Look at you.

You are thinking about it,
arent you?

You counting exits...

Guards...

Could you get to me in time?

How would you do it,
I wonder...

That woman's pen?

His cane?

Maybe his glasses?

My hands.

How exiting.

Yet you know you cannot, can you?

I told you... I needed that guy!

The way you are looking
at me right now.

I needed THE BOOGEYMAN.

I needed John Wick.

Just tell me what you want...

I want you to kill my sister.

Why?

There are 12 seats
at the high table.

Camorra, the Mafia Ndrangheta.

Chinese, the Russian...

When my father died...

He willed a sit to her.

She represents Camorra now.

And I cant tell but wonder...

What I might accomplishing instead...

You want me to kill...

Gianna D'Antonio?

I could never did.

She is my blood.

I still love her.

It cant be done.
She is in Rome.

For her coronation.

You will take the catacombs...
It does not matter where she is.

That's why...

I need a Ghost,
John Wick.

That's why I need you.

Do this for me...

And your marker is honored.

What say you?

Never want to waste words.

5903.5.

Happy hunting, Mr. Wick.

Welcome to the Continental of Rome.

How might I be of assistance?

I would like a room.

Jonathan!

Julius.

Ciao.
Nice to see you.

I fail to recall the last
time you were in Rome.

And here I heard...

You're retired.

I had.

Then you ll answer me...

One question.

Are you here to kill the Pope?

No.

Alright then.

One of our finest rooms.

Grazie.

Enjoy your stay.

Mr. Wick.

Is the Sommelier in?

I have never known him not to be.

Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

It's being a long time...

I would like a tasting.

I am quite exciting to show you something

First...

Good morning, Mr. Wick.

Hi, Angela.

Welcome back to Rome.

Would you be in
need of a new suit?

I am.
I know...

from your past that you
love the German varietals...

But let me introduce the
latest products from Austria.

Glock 34 mm and 26 mm.

This is the original map
of D'Antonio estate.

Here you have all
the ancient ruins.

Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or social affair?

Social.
Is this for Day or Evening?

I need one for day
and one for night.

With control grips.

Flat macwell for easy reloads.

And I know you ll appreciate
the custom porting.

What's next?

I need something robust, precise.

Robust, Precise.

This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

And what style?
Italian.

How many buttons?
Two.

Trousers?
Tapered.

How about the lining?

Tactical.

AR-15.

11.5 inch.

Reinforced ionic bonds.

With 1-6 magnification.

And this is the modern blueprint.

There are one, two, three gates.

Silicon carbide discs.

Ceramic metrisis.

Laminated.
Body armor.

We just sew it between
the fabric and the lining.

Zero penetration.

However...

Quite painful I am afraid.

Could you recommend anything
for the end the night?

Something big...

May I suggest...

The Benelli M4.

Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

Textured grips.

If your hands get... wet.

An Italian classic.

Dessert?

Dessert.

The finest cutlery.

Fresh-sharpened.

Well done.

Could you do a rush order?
I sure can

Where do you like it to have it sent?
The Hotel.

Should I have everything
sent to your room?

Yes.

Thank you.
Excellent.

Mr. Wick?

Do enjoy your party!

Good evening.

Are you enjoying the party?

Excuse me, miss.

Mr. Akon is waiting.

In a moment.

Mr. Akon.

Are you enjoying the festivities?

Thank you for seeing me.

Please sit.

Miss D'Antonio...

You cant just take what is ri...
Nothing was taken.

Those among your own came
to us with these territories.

A knife was pressed
in their throats.

Semantics.

Besides...

That blade you speak of was
meant for their children.

They were only meant to watch.

What is yours is now ours...

Mr Akon.

Now go.

Enjoy the party.

Have some fun.

Why dont you go to
entertain our guests...

while I freshen up my makeup.

Okay, Signora.

What could I do without you,
Cassian?



John.

Gianna.

There was a time not so long ago
we considered us...

As friends.

I still do.

Deaths very emissary...

What brought you back, John?

A marker.

By...?

Your Brother.

Tell me, John...

This marker...

Is it how you go out?

And what was her name...?

This woman whose life
has ended on my own?

Helen.

Helen.

This Helen...

was she worth the price
that now you see to pay?

Now...

let me tell you what
happens when I die.

Santino ll claim my sit on the table.

He will take New York.

And you...

Will be the one who gift it to him.

What would Helen
think about that john?

What would Helen
think about you?

Why?

Because...
I lived my live in my way.

And I ll die in my way.

Do you fear domination, John?

Yes.

You know...

I always thought
I could escape it.

That I would see it coming...

That I would see you.

John?

Cassian.

You work here?

Yeah.

You?
Yeah.

Good night?

I am afraid so...

I'm sorry to hear that.

Get him!

Loose ends?

Just one.

Yeah...

Are you having a good night,
arent you John?

Gentlemen!

Gentlemen!

Do I need to remind you...

There will be no business contacted
on the continental grounds?

No senior.

No sir.

Now may I suggest...
a visit to the bar.

So you calm yourselves.

Gin, wasnt it?

Yes.

Bourbon?

Right?

Yeah.

Thanks.

Grazie.

I have a marker.

Whose?

Her brother...

I see.

You had no choice.

He wants her sit in the table.

He will get it now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So you're free.

Am I?

No.

Not at all.

You killed my "buddy".

Someone I was close to.

An Eye for an eye, John.

You know how it goes...

Yeah.

I'll make it quick.

I promise.

I appreciate that.

I will try to do the same...

This round is on me.

Consider it a professional courtesy.

<i>Having a tough night?</i>

<i>Can I buy a drink?</i>

No.

Thanks.

Hello, John.

I understand if you're upset.

And I know it might
feel personal.

But what kind of man would I be.

If I did not avenge my sisters murder.

John?

Could you let management know I ll
be checking out in the morning.

Operator.

What can I do for you?

Bank DeVo.
One moment please.

How can I help you?

I would like to open an account.
Name for the account?

John Wick.

Verification?

930-05.

State of contract?
Open.

Denomination?

$ 7,000,000.

Processing, please hold.

I appreciate the service.
My pleasure.

You will find a safe passage below.

Transportation is waiting for you.

May you have a safe journey,
Mr. Wick.

Order confirmed.

What is this?

He completed the task.

The marker... is over.

Marker?

If Mr. Wick is not dead already...

He soon will be.

You mark it, sir.

You have no idea.

Whats coming to you.

I have everyone in New
York looking for him.

I doubt...

We ll see him again.

Really?

You stabbed the devil in the back.

And force him back into the
life that he had just left.

You've burned the prince temple.

Burn it to the ground.

Now he is free of the marker...

What do you think he will do?

He had a glimpse of the
other side and he embraced it.

But you Mr. Antonio...

Took it away from him.

He was already back.

He came back for love,
not for you.

He owed me.

I had the right.

And now...

He is coming again.

I did tell you not to do this.

He did warn you.

Adios, Antonio.

Stop.

<i>Please let MTA personnel in the
event of suspicious activity.</i>

<i>Canal Street.</i>

<i>You're on the train C Broad Street.</i>

<i>Next stop, Rector Street.</i>

The blade is in your aortic artery.

You pull it out,
you will bleed and you will die.

Consider this a professional courtesy.

If you see anything suspicious...

What you see is the nightmare man.

Take me to him.

Tell him it's John Wick.

Did you know that the
put it in everything.

As I live and breath!

John Wick.

The man.

The myth... the legend.

You are not very good in retiring.

I'm working on it.

Mr. Wick does not remember
but we met many years ago.

Before my aseption...

When I was just a pawn in the game.

We met and you gave me a gift.

The gift that would make me a king.

You do not remember, but there
I was standing in alley...

I did not even hear you coming.

You gave me this.

A gift from THE BOOGEYMAN.

Perfect for every occasion.

But you also gave me a choice.

Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back and die...

or keep the pressure on my neck...

And live.

And so you see, I survived.

No one sneaks up on me anymore.

Thanks to you.

Am all seeing em...

All know em.

Then you know why I am here.

Santino D'Antonio, yeah.

Your contract is gone, John.

That is bad for your health.

What is the number up to now, Earl?

Seven million dollars!

Damn!

It's Christmas.

We are going to
Applebee's after this.

I need your help.

You have eyes begging for change
in every corner of the city.

I am thinking you
could find Santino.

I need you to move me.

Underground.

Get me to him.

Sweet it is!

The BOOGEYMAN begging me for help.

Of course, John.

Whatever you like, John.

Do you like a massage, too, John?

You're going to help me.

Why the fak should I do that?

Because I'm the only
one that can help you.

You are gonna help me out.

You are very good, Mr. Wick.

You sound very positive.

But look around you.

How much help does
it look like I need?

It seems to me that the
real question, Mr. Wick...

Is who in this cruel world
of ours is gonna help you.

There is a storm coming.

Not just for me.

But for all of us.

For everyone under the table.

Yes. Killing someone who has
a sit at the high table...

does create problem.

But its your problem, baby.

After all, none of my people sent...

Gianna D'Antonio...
to the year after.

That been said..

Santino has her sit now.

And he wants the city.

When he is done uptown, do you
think he is gonna stop on the street 14?

We ll just have to
take care of ourselves.

Yeah?

For how long?

And how much blood?

You kill Santino...

The Camorra and the high
table will come for you.

I kill Santino...

They will come for me.

He offered seven million
dollars for your life.

Seven million dollars.
Its a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

So I guess you have a choice.

You want a war?

Or you can just give me a gun?

Somebody!
Please get this man a gun.

Kimber 1911
.45 ACP.

Seven round capacity.

Seven rounds?

Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

Thats a million dollars a round, baby.

Lets go.

The road to hell begins here, Mr. Wick.

He is at the museum.

Earl will guide you,
to be careful on your way down.

And remember...

You owe me.

You dont want me owing you.

Welcome, everyone.

Let us toast to the future of the high
table and the memory of my dear sister...

Mr. Akon, how are you?

Wick is here!

Yeah.

You and you with me.
You go.

<i>Welcome reflections of the soul
of the new modern New York.</i>

<i>In this performance, the play of light
and the nature of self-image...</i>

<i>Unite provide an experience
that highlights...</i>

<i>The fragility of our perception
of space and our place in it.</i>

<i>We hope that this show can
provide new insights...</i>

<i>For your understanding of
the world, and maybe...</i>

<i>Will lead to a deeper reflection
on the nature of sound.</i>

My God, John.

Oh my God.

You just dont get it.

The mark is completed John.

You ve should just run away.

You know what the
Camorra will do to you.

You think you're the Old Testament?

No, John.

No.

Killing me will not stop the contract.

Killing me will make
it so much worse.

John.

You know what I think?

I think you're addicted.

To revenges.

<i>Welcome reflections of the soul
of the new modern New York.</i>

No wife...

No Life...

No home...

Vengeance...

That's all you have.

You wanted me back.

I'm back.

Go. I will finish this.

Be seeing you.

Sure.

Good evening.

Is the Manager in?

The manager...

He is always in.

Winston!

Mr. D'Antonio?

Lovely evening, I see.

Seeking safe harbor I presume?

I want a membership provoked.
Now.

In the eyes of this institution,
Mr.Wick is ok.

Then you know that I have
the right to demand...

Nothing!
You demand nothing, Mr. D'Antonio.

This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

Right.

Then enjoy your kingdom,
Winston, while you still can...

And you, its privileges, sir.

I am here to see Santino D'Antonio.

He is waiting for you in a lounge,
Sir.

Duck fat.

Makes all the difference.

Jonathan,
have you seen the menu here?

Where are the options?

Jonathan, listen to me...

Guests can stay here...
a long time...

And never eat the
same menu twice.

Jonathan just walk away.

Yeah, Jonathan.
Walk away...

What have you done?

Finished it.

How was he?

He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

Lets go home.

Mr. Wick?

If you would be so...

Come on, boy.

It has been a pleasure Mr.Wick.

Good-Bye.

John.

Winston.

What am I looking at?

The Camorra doubles Santinos open
contract is going international.

High table?

And the Continental?

You've killed the man on
continental ground, Jonathan.

You leave me no choice but to
declay you ex-comunicado...

Any services we provided...

and connection of The Continental
are now closed to you...

I'm so sorry.

Your life is now fulfilled.

Then why am I not dead?

Cause I didnt want you to be.

Now.

You have one hour.
I cannot delay it any longer.

You might need this.

Down the road.

Winston.

Tell them.

Tell them All.

Who ever comes...

I will kill them.

I will kill them all.

Of course you will.

Jonathan.

Winston.

Accounts pay-role.

In 1 hour.

John Wick.

Ex-comunicado...

Orders 11.111 confirmed.
