I moved my family
to western New York for land.

Like my father
and his father before him,

I want to grow old
with my family around me.

With my sons working the land
by my side, in peace.

The fire of religion has gotten hot,
competing for every new convert.

That's false doctrine, Reverend.

We're holding orthodox meetings
in my home!

And then, Joseph Smith came
into our lives.

A farm boy who claimed he talked
with God and saw angels.

He printed a new book of scripture

he said he'd translated
from golden plates.

He founded a church.

I don't know how Joseph has done this,
but it's evil and I want no part of it.

What right do you have to tell us
what we will or won't believe?

And it's tearing my family apart.

I've already lost one son.
My boy, Joshua.

He hates the Mormons

and hates his brother, Nathan,

You've shamed the family enough.

For stealing his girl, Lydia.

Joshua, no!

He's cleared out
for the Missouri frontier

where a lot of lost souls congregate.

Joshua?

But maybe weâ€™ll have
a little peace today,

for this is a happy day.

Brothers and sisters,
it's a good day for a new beginning.

I'm honored to perform the marriage
of Nathan Steed and Lydia McBride.

Smith, stop this wedding now!

That man, sir, has no legal right
to perform any wedding of any kind.

I request that you put a stop
to it immediately.

Papa.
I'm sorry, Lydia, but I warned you.

Mr. Smith,
how do you answer these charges?

I deny them.

Our church was legally organized
as of a week ago.

That's a lie!

And I'm an ordained minister
in that church.

You have witnesses
to the organization of this church?

That's enough, Mr. McBride.

Look, Mr. Steed,

I know you don't want this wedding
any more than I do.

Now...
That has nothing to do with it.

Sir, Mr. McBride has come
onto my property uninvited.

I believe you call that trespassing.

And if he doesn't leave quickly,
I will be forced to press charges.

This is absurd, Mr. Steed,
and you know it.

This man is a deceiver!
Let's go, McBride.

Goodbye, Lydia.

I think we can continue now.

Thank you, Pa.

Look at me, both of you.

What God joins together,
let no man put asunder.

Nathan Steed, my old friend,

and Lydia McBride, my new friend,

do you covenant to be
each other's companions through life,

to care for, to cherish

and to give one another
all that you have and are

till the end of your days?

Yes, Joseph.

I do.

Good.

Then by the power that is indeed
granted me by the state of New York,

and by the authority given by
the God of Heaven and Earth,

I pronounce you husband and wife
for as long as you both shall live.

And in the spirit of prophecy, I tell you,

this union will one day heal this family.

And it won't be here in Palmyra,
but in Zion.

Now Nathan, will you kiss her
before someone else comes

and tries to interrupt this marriage?

Joshua.

I just...
just want to wish you all the best.

Son?

Pa.
You stay away from her.

Pa, that's not why I'm here.

You stay away from her and this family.
You're no longer welcome here.

That's a real fine "How do you do," Pa.
It's not a gun in your face.

Come on! Come on.

You all right?

Yes.

We thank you, Lord,
for Nathan and Lydia's new life together.

Ow!
Matthew.

Bless them.

And Lord, bless Joshua.

Thirty-five acres in sweet corn...

We miss him.

Five acres near the river in squash,
tomatoes and beets.

Watch over him and if you can...

Forty acres in wheat.

Bring him back home to us.

Twenty apple trees.

For all our abundant blessings,
we thank you. In Jesus' name, Amen.

Joshua.
Amen.

Jessie!

Jessie!

What's wrong?
Marry me.

Jess,

marry me.
Fine.

And so by the power vested in me
by the great state of Missouri,

I pronounce you man and wife.

Congratulations. I wish you
all the happiness, I really do.

Thanks, Bobby.
Goodnight. Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed.

I got this.

Jess, I'm gonna take you out
of this place. Out of this saloon.

You won't ever have to come back here
unless you want to.

Promise me?

All right.
Promise me.

Jess, all this,
this will be like it never happened.

Oh, hello. My goodness.
We saw the candle in the window.

Come, sit. You must be freezing.

Hello.
Hello, this is a nice surprise. Nathan.

Are we interrupting your work?
No, no, don't worry about that.

He's preparing the revelations
to publish them.

The ones we've written down anyway.

Sit down, sit down.
Make yourselves comfortable.

What can we do for the Steeds?

Joseph, you remember at our wedding,

you told us something.

I believe I told you to kiss the girl.

Yes. Just before that...

You said we weren't gonna stay
in Palmyra.

Where's Zion?

I can tell you something more.

Joseph Smith, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

What are the charges this time, Frank?

Claiming to have visions,
setting the neighborhood in an uproar.

I don't write them, Joseph.
I just carry them out.

You'll come with me.

What are these?
That's none of your affair.

Nathan!

I've got to admit that I'm surprised
you jumped in there like that, Nathan.

Something I'd expect Joshua to do,
or maybe your pa, but not you.

Where's Frank?
Frank's out.

How you doing, Joe?
Joseph!

All right, prophet man,
why don't you prophesy for us?

Joseph!
Who hit you?

Who hit you?

Frank!
First you tell us who hit you.

Frank's coming back.

Joseph, are you all right?

Yes, I'm all right.

Why won't people just leave us alone?

You asked me what I meant

when I said that you wouldn't
be staying in Palmyra.

We're leaving this place.

The Lord is calling his people to Ohio.

Ls that where Zion is?
Zion is more than a place, Nathan.

To St. Louis for him. Give him a deal
if he's ready by tomorrow night.

New York, I know.
But this will get him as far as St. Louis.

He should be interested in half-price.

We are here on a mission
to speak to you.

And Wilson Everett's waiting for you.
He says to tell you he wants to collect

on what we owe him for those wagons,
which puts us in an awkward situation.

Ls he smiling?
Sure, he's smiling.

Then I know what he wants.

Wilson Everett. Something tells me
this isn't a friendly visit.

Can't a man just stop by anymore?

So, here it is.
I'm good for it, you know that.

But seeing as how
I didn't know you were coming,

we can settle things over
a friendly game of poker

down at Roundy's tonight.

I think that sounds like a fine idea.

Bought a new dress today.

You like it?
Yeah, I like it. Why wouldn't I?

Hey, did you see my watch,
my new one?

Downstairs on the table.

You ever heard of the Mormons?

Yeah, why?

No reason. Just saw some of them
in town today, is all.

In lndependence?

Joshua, you up there?
Yeah, I'm coming, Bobby.

Stay away from the Mormons.

Joshua.

I got something to tell you.

What, Jessie?

Nothing. I'll tell you later.

Get back here!

Thank you, Everett.
See you again.

You the Mormons?
Yes, sir.

Parley Pratt's the name. And you are?

Stay away from my wife.

Joshua Steed.

It's a peaceful place, isn't it?
Lt is.

Do you know yet
where we'll stay tonight?

Not yet.

I'm sorry, Sister Smith,
but I'm sure the Lord will provide for us.

I've heard the Lord provides
for those who provide for themselves.

I'm sure I've heard that somewhere.

I believe that.

Anything else, Carl?

This is it.
The mercantile?

Newell K. Whitney, thou art the man.

I'm afraid you have
the advantage of me, sir.

I'm Joseph, the prophet.
You've prayed me here.

Now what do you want of me?

Joseph Smith?
The same.

Joseph Smith. Welcome to Kirtland.
Have you a place to stay?

Welcome to Ohio, Sister Smith.

First group should be leaving Palmyra
within a week or so.

I'm surprised people were able
to sell their farms so quickly.

Some of them made it all right,

but some, I guess, are selling short
or walking away.

And why would they just walk away?

Because the Lord asked them to.

Because I did.

Yes, but you did not ask them
to just up and leave everything.

I told them that the Lord wanted them
in Ohio as soon as they could.

And He does.

Some of them are coming with nothing
but the clothes on their backs.

And where will they stay
once they get here?

Not everyone has your faith, Joseph.

I don't have all the answers yet.

But when the Lord commands, I do it.
"I do it." Yes, I know.

At least, I try.

So they'll leave everything.

You did.

Where's Ohio?

It's on the other side
of Pennsylvania, dummy.

Where's Pennsylvania?
It's between...

Matthew, that is not ready to go yet!
Put it back, please.

Excuse me, Mrs. Steed.
We're about ready to head out.

Lydia, you need to sit down.

You packed your quilts, didn't you?
The baby's gonna need them.

I only had room for one.
Then I'll put in a couple of mine.

That's the nice thing
about not having much, I suppose.

Easier to pack up and go.

I want to go, Mama.
That's enough, Melissa.

Mama, why do we have
to move to Ohio?

We're not, dear.
Just Nathan and Lydia are.

Then why are you packing my shirts?

We're just going till the baby comes,
then we're coming back.

Why ain't Pa and Melissa coming?
Why aren't Pa and Melissa coming?

That's a good question, Mother.

Your pa can't leave the farm
and he needs Melissa's help.

What, with the milking
of the cows and...

This isn't about milking cows, Mother!
This is about Joseph.

Melissa, that's enough!

God speaks to Joseph Smith, Mama,
and he is asking us to follow him.

Do we just ignore that?

God also said
to honor your father and your mother.

Is that what Zion means, Mama?
Moving to Ohio?

I'm not sure, honey.

I want to go.

Papa?
No.

Why not?

Because I need help
around here, Melissa.

And contrary to what you
and Nathan may think,

I can't run this farm by myself.

If you'll just listen, I...
No.

Will you at least just let me tell you
why I want to go?

And why?
I want to go to Zion.

And this Zion is in Ohio, is it?

You don't know
what you're talking about.

Just because you don't know what I'm
talking about doesn't mean I don't.

What then?

What does it mean, Melissa?
Please tell me.

It's where the Saints are.

I don't understand all of it,
but I know that it's real.

And, you don't know.

And I am not going to have
my whole family running away

chasing some boy who's promising Zion
or whatever you want to call it.

No! You'll just drive them away
one by one,

with your stubborn, bullheaded ways!

No, Melissa. No. No. No.

You're the one
who's running away, Papa.

What are you so afraid of?

Mary Ann.

I know I don't entirely understand it,

but I can tell you what I think Zion is,
what I hope it is.

I hope it's a place
where a family can find peace.

Where a mother can gather all
her children around her, every last one,

and not have this aching for those
who've wandered or been pushed away.

If that's what Zion is,

then I don't know what I wouldn't do
to find it.

Saying goodbye?

I suppose.

Are you all right?

Nathan, where will we live?

What's going to become of us?

Come Thou Fount of every blessing

Tune my heart to sing Thy grace

Streams of mercy never ceasing

Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet

Sung by flaming tongues above

Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it

Mount of Thy redeeming love

Get back, get back, get back. Good girl.

Good morning, Ben.
Morning, Martin.

Consider horses for this?
I'll loan you a couple.

No, I prefer mules, thank you.

I'm selling my farm, Ben.
Moving to Ohio.

Kirtland?
Yeah.

Leaving with a group
the end of this month.

There's a lot of good land
there, too, Ben.

That's not why you're going though,
is it?

No.

No, there's a greater purpose here, Ben.
That's true.

I don't know, Ben.

For a man who is aching for a change,
why not Ohio?

Why not a place where there's
a lot of good land, a lot of good people?

A place where he can be close
to his grandbabies?

Come with me, Ben.

I'm not having my family
chasing after Joseph.

I understand Melissa
had her own ideas.

She'll be back.

She's stubborn.
Oh, yeah. She's a Steed.

I'm right about this, Martin.

You may not see it now, but I'm right.

You pull it up by the roots,
you're likely to kill the tree.

And you of all people should know that.

All the trees
and all the land in the world, Ben,

isn't worth two bits
if the man who owns it

sits alone in an empty house.

So, your wife's going to Ohio with you,
is she?

Now, you know she won't, Ben.
Then why? For Joseph?

I held those gold plates
in my hands, Ben.

I saw the angel.
It burns like a fire in my bones, Ben.

And you're willing to give up your family
to follow Joseph Smith?

Are you willing to give up yours
for a piece of land?

I'll keep an eye on Nathan
and his family for you.

Joseph says God is calling
the Mormons to gather in Ohio,

but I think they wore out
their welcome in New York.

They scare folks.
Voting together, buying together.

Anyway, they'd come to Kirtland
dirt poor, most of them,

ready to start again.

Kirtland is growing.

And growing fastest
was the foolishness about the temple.

People left off building their own houses
and sowing their own fields

to rear up a temple.

Dirt farmers trying to act like Saints.

Joseph.

No, thank you.

Joseph, we're building a temple

before many of our people
have a proper place to live.

That's what we're doing, right?

How long has it been since the Lord
had a temple on Earth?

Eighteen hundred years, I suppose.

Don't you think it's about time?

Nathan, unless I'm mistaken,

you're living in a lean-to
out back of the Whitney's,

with a wife who's expecting any day.

That's right.
Until I can build my own place.

Then why would you help
with this temple?

I guess 'cause you asked me to.

We are building this temple now
because the Lord asked us to.

Nathan, Ma said you got to come.

Lydia.

Ma! Ma!

Nathan. It's good to see you, son.

Look at him!

Pa, what are you doing here?
Lt looks like the Lord opened a way.

Joseph.
Welcome to Kirtland, Ben.

Brother Steed.
Did you sell your farm?

No. And I'm not going to.

I'm here just long enough to build
Nathan and Lydia a decent place

and then we're going home.

Fair enough.

Martin, thank you for coming,
and for bringing so many with you.

Wherever you are, Joseph.

Parley, why don't you tell the Steeds
what you found in Missouri?

I found Joshua.

I can't. I can't.

Lydia, look at me.

You're stronger than you know.

You bear down, girl.

The Lord will give you strength, child,
don't you doubt it.

That's it.

Good. Bear down. Bear down. Good.

It's coming.
Bear down.

You've done it.

Looks like you've gotten yourself
a little Nathan.

Grandpa.

Good morning.

Ben.
How are you?

I've asked Brother Phelps and
Brother Partridge to serve as witnesses.

They'll be leaving for Missouri
next week to establish a printing press

that will publish the revelations
the Lord has given us.

Is that where Zion will finally be,
Joseph? In Missouri?

You told us once that Zion was more
than just a place.

It is, Nathan.

Zion is the city the Lord will build
for His people.

Where there will be no poor among us

and we will all be
of one heart and one mind.

Now, let's bless this baby
and give him a name.

Father in Heaven,
we hold this child in our hands

so that through your holy priesthood,

we may give him a name
and a blessing.

And the name he shall carry
throughout his life will be...

And the name we give him is...

His name is Joshua Benjamin Steed.

Hey, Pa, I've got some nails coming up
for you.

No, bring the others.

Ben.

Have you met Brigham Young yet?

He came over from New York
just after you did.

Good to meet you, Brother Steed.
Just Ben will be fine, thank you.

Ben, we've been sent by Brother Joseph

to give you a hand
on Nathan's house here.

He said to thank you
for your help on the temple.

I haven't helped on the temple.

That might be why he was smiling
when he said it.

All the same, here we are.

Mr. Young, is it? ls it Bingham, is it?
Brigham.

Well, Brigham, thank you for your offer.

But as you can see,
we're doing just fine.

It's no trouble at all. Come on, brethren.

Why don't you head around back?

Go get the measure for me.
It's right over there.

Martin?
Ben.

Ben, where are you hiding
those nine penny nails?

Afternoon, Miss Steed.

Carl Rogers, you're not a Mormon.
What are you doing here?

I don't know. I saw a house going up.

I thought maybe I could lend a hand
if you don't mind.

I don't mind.

Brother Steed.

Good job, Mr. Young.
Brigham.

Thank you, Pa.

So, now that we've got a roof
over our heads,

how long before you head back
to Palmyra?

Didn't I tell you I'd make it back
before Friday, huh?

Half day to spare, too.

Pigeon. Tell Bobby Johnson
he owes me $5.

I'll do that. Wilson Everett stopped by
twice while you were gone.

Does he want to lose
more money to me?

Something like that, I'm sure.

Well, I may have to oblige him.
I need a drink.

Jessie. Jess.

What's wrong?
Get dressed.

Joshua.

Just cut your losses and walk away.
I can't.

Yes. Yes, you can.
Do you want me to lose everything?

Now, I told him I was coming back here
to get some more money.

I just need your help
to get things turned around.

You know what to do.
Joshua!

You promised.
Don't ask me to do that, please.

I'm not asking.

I'll take three.

You know what,
I got a bad feeling about this one.

I think I'm gonna get out now.

Pair of sixes, queen high.
What have you got?

Pair of tens.

Good move.
Looks like your luck might be turning.

How about we get another deck
from the house?

It's fine by me.
New deck, Clint!

What do you say, we put the kids
to bed and play some real poker?

Fifty to open, heads up.
All right.

Heard say you got yourself a wife.
Is that right?

That's right. Ante up.

Is she a pretty little thing?

Who?
Your wife.

She's pretty, huh?
Yeah, that's what people say.

You want to talk about my wife
or you want to play some cards?

Two hundred.

Hey, you know what,
I'm getting kind of tired.

So, I'll see your $200, raise you $150.

Fine.

How many cards you need?
One.

And I'll take two.

Bet you $300.

Looks like you're a little shy of that.

Well, I've got four Conestogas outside
and the teams to pull them.

That ought to cover it.

I guess that means
winner takes everything.

I guess so.

All right.

Lay them down.

Full house. Aces full. Sorry, Everett.

Not as sorry as I am.

Straight flush, Mr. Steed.

Jessie! Jessie, wait!

Joshua, no!

What did you do? What did you do?

I've lost everything because of you.
You know that?

I've lost everything because of you!
Do you hear me, little girl?

Joshua, no, please!
Leave the lady alone!

Stop!

The Mormons outnumber
the old settlers in Kirtland.

Their new Mormon neighbors
make them uneasy.

The wild stories and the threats
are following Joseph to Ohio.

Hello.
Hello.

Has his fever broken yet?
Not yet. He's been like this for hours.

I'll take him.
Okay.

You try and get some sleep.

No! Emma, stay back!

Emma, take the baby!

Didn't see us coming, did you?
What kind of prophet are you?

Stop fighting or we'll
get your little wife!

Oh, baby. My dear Emma.

Let me, dear.

Mother.

Sweetheart. Let go.

Let go. Let go.

No.

No, please! Don't do it. Don't take him.

Don't take him.

Parley.

We thought Zion was in Ohio,
but we were wrong.

Joseph sent one of his apostles,
Parley Pratt,

out to Missouri to buy up land
for the real Zion.

You're looking at the Mormon Zion
as they call it.

See all those huts?

Weren't even there two weeks ago.

Here's Partridge's place.
That's where she is.

Let me give you some advice, my friend.

Start over. She's trash anyway.

Joshua.

Jessica.

Jessie.

I'm sorry, Jess.

I'm real sorry. Come home, Jessie.

I need you.

I promise you,
I will never hurt you again.

It'll be like it never happened.

But it did happen. Joshua, it happened.

I am not going to have my wife
and my child

living in some hut
with a bunch of Mormons.

Now, come on.

That's enough. You step away from her.

Now.
This is my wife!

And you cannot keep her here.
No, we can't.

But she's welcome to stay,
as long as she wants.

Please go.

They say there's too many of you
in these parts. Maybe they're right.

The Saints are coming to Zion,
Mr. Steed.

So, you better get used to it.

This is our land.
We'll see.

We'll see.
Josh?

These people truly believe
that all this land belongs to them

whether they pay for it or not.

Granted to them by God Himself.
It's their Zion, their Utopia.

That's what Joe Smith tells them.

Frankly, I don't care
about Joe Smith or angels

or any of that hogwash.

The fact is we've
got abolitionist neighbors.

They're even inviting freed slaves
to come up the Missouri.

I've got it right here in their own words.

Now, this is from their printing press
that's not a stone's throw from here.

They're inviting freed slaves, Sam.

They ain't just printing
Joe Smith's revelations over there.

Now religion's one thing,
but you start interfering with slavery

and suddenly all of our business
from the South

won't come up the Missouri anymore.

I got Mormons on three sides of
my property out there in Kaw Township.

Well, shoot them.

Lieutenant Governor Boggs.
Gentlemen.

You have anything to add?

I was just wondering
what Mr. Steed here feels about all this.

I want them out.
I have my own reasons.

As do I. As do I.

Look, you all know I'm here unofficially.

But it seems evident to me

that the effects of this rapid influx of
Mormons could not have been foreseen.

Therefore, our laws are not prepared
to deal with them.

And if we wait for legislation, the delays
will put the mischief beyond all remedy.

Gentlemen, the Mormons have to go.
Amen.

For the good of Jackson County
and I believe as American citizens

it is our duty to help them on their way.

Peaceably, if we can.
Forcibly, if we must.

The only question should be,

when and how.

We go now. Right now.
And we shut down this press.

For a glass of whiskey,
we'll raise ourselves an army.

Edward, I've got to go down
and try to stop them.

Whatever happens, save the Book!

No! No, no, no!

Gentlemen, gentlemen.

Please, you have no right.

You attacking me, Phelps?
Is that what this has come to?

You have no right.

You all saw it.
I was attacked without provocation.

We're well within our rights
to defend ourselves.

Yeah!

So then, defend yourselves.

Come on!

I just have one question for you.

Where is Joe Smith
when you need him?

That's what I thought.

So, what are we going to do
about the Mormons?

I don't want to sound unreasonable,

but there is a way out of this mess.

Yeah!
Yeah!

Renounce Joe Smith.
Yeah.

I cannot do that.

What did you say?

I will not deny what I know to be true.

Sure as I know God lives,
I know Joseph is His prophet.

I met your father, Mr. Steed.

He's a good man.

That'll teach you.
Yeah.

Ouch.

Strip 'em.

They call this the Whitmer Settlement.

It's about 20 cabins right on
the Big Blue just below the ferry.

Now it's mostly trees all the way in,
so we've got cover.

We've nothing to worry about.

Now, I've seen them gathering
like flies down at Kaw Township.

Why don't we start there
and just work our way up?

No. No. Not yet.
We're gonna start up here

and move our way down
to the Coleville Settlement.

All right. All right.
All right, you men ready?

Yeah!
Let's go.

I seen her, Mr. Steed. I seen the baby.
They're still in the same place.

I need you to do something else
for me, all right?

Edward, get the word out here.
I'm on my way to the Colesville Branch.

The mobs have already hit
the Whitmer Settlement!

Get your women
and your young ones together.

We're gonna go!
We're gonna move them to Colesville.

Let's go! They're coming this way!

Dear Jessica.
I hope this letter finds you in time.

You got to get out now, Jess.
Come back to Independence.

The Mormons will leave
Jackson County.

Nothing can stop that now.

But you must not be there
when it happens.

Take the baby and run.

Now, come on out, nice and easy.

We'll go take a little walk.
Come on. Let's go!

George, I know you.
I said, move!

Get your hands off her!
Joshua.

I told you to leave.
And go where?

Jessica, you need to come
with me right now. They're coming.

Joshua, these are women and children.

Jess, they just want the Mormons out.
I am a Mormon!

Come on, Joshua. We got to move.

Do you really think we'd be safe
in Independence?

Just bring the baby and come back.

Please.
"It'll be like it never happened"?

Jess.

What's her name?

Rachel.

Jessie, if you would just
give me one more chance.

I can't tell you how sorry I am
I hurt you that night.

If I could turn things back, I would.

Just know that I will never do
anything again to cause you pain.

Your feet are bleeding.

Mine are, too.

I guess Pa won't have any trouble
finding us.

Come back, Jessie.

I need to hold my daughter
and my wife.

Joshua.

I still don't understand it.

Dirt poor Mormon converts
working on the temple

just because Joseph asked them to.

Giving everything.

Finishing the temple is an obsession.

To show their faith.

It's a sight to see.

Good day.
Good day to you.

I and some of my congregation
have come to see the Mormons.

Are you Mormons?
I am.

Did you come to help, Ben?
Or did you just find religion?

Good morning, Joseph.
Good morning.

Do I have the privilege of standing
before a prophet of God?

You might. Do you wanna wrestle?

Well, we... That is...

We were wanting to question you
on a few matters.

All right. Brother...
Ezra Booth.

How can I help you, Brother Booth?

Can we go?
No.

Well, to cut to the heart of it,
do you actually believe, sir,

that you are a prophet
like Moses or Abraham?

I don't think that what you believe
and what I believe are all that different.

You believe that God used
to talk to man.

I believe that He still does.

Well, surely, sir, then if you're a
prophet,

you can heal
dear Sister Elsa Johnson here,

her arm being stricken
these many years.

Parley!

Parley. Parley.

Joseph.

Parley, what happened?
Zion is...

Zion is no more.

Nathan, get him to the house.
He's freezing.

Brigham, can you run
and tell Emma we're coming?

Sister Elsa Johnson, do you believe
that the Lord can heal you?

Then in the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to be whole.

They'd already driven our women
and our children

over into Clay County
before we got back.

It was the dead of night,
more than 16 miles in the snow.

By the time we found them,

one of them had died,
the Ralstons' little girl.

They didn't even give us
a couple of days to collect our things.

There are no Saints
in Jackson County, Joseph.

Zion is lost.

We are but a handful here.

But this church,

will fill North and South America.

And one day, it will fill the world.

It will fill the Rocky Mountains.

There will be tens of thousands
of Saints gathered there.

Zion is what God has commanded.

How can we fulfill His purposes
if we do not go in there and redeem it?

I'm going to Zion
if I have to march there on foot.

Those farms are ours.
We paid for that land.

And the Lord would have us come
to the aid of our brothers and sisters

and set things aright.

By force, if necessary.

Good morning, Sister Steed. Ben.
Good morning, Joseph.

Joseph.

You've heard we're marching
to Missouri to repair what's been done?

I heard.

And you've heard that Nathan
has volunteered?

I'm sure that he would have been
one of the first.

Probably right.

You sold your farm in Palmyra.

I did.

Ben, I know I haven't been able to
convince you to help with the temple,

but can I convince you
to leave your family,

risk life and limb, march
1,000 miles to help redeem Zion?

You know all this trouble in Missouri,

Joshua's right in the middle of it.

We set out for Missouri
on the fifth of May, 1 834.

A thousand miles ahead of us.

Two hundred and five men, 25 wagons,

carrying our own muskets and
bayonets, powder and shot, and tools.

Tools and supplies
for the Mormons we hope

will get their homes back
in Jackson County.

We survive on johnnycake
and corn dodgers.

The water is bad.

Joseph is leading like he was born to it.

You awake?
Yeah.

This ground is hard as a rock.

Did I ever tell you it took me two years
to decide to become a Mormon?

No.

Oh, yeah.

Everybody around me was practically
jumping in the water, but not me.

I was...

Now, you've got me beat, Ben.

You both have me beat by a mile.

I was one of those eager folks
jumping right in.

Truth be told though, I might
have had some second thoughts,

but then I met Joseph.

Have you ever been with him
when he speaks the revelation?

Well, I have.
Say what you want about Joseph Smith

but when you've seen him speak
in the name of the Lord,

the light in his eyes
and his countenance,

there's just no room for doubt.

At least there wasn't for me.

Tearing my family apart.

It's picking it up
and ripping it into pieces.

All this talk of prophets and revelations.

Seems like a man just about
has to give up everything he's got

in order to try and hold things together.

Nathan, you awake?

Sure am.

What are you gonna do
when we get to Missouri?

I mean, we all know who's there.

I don't know.

Guess I'll do what has to be done.

Oh, Lord, please watch over
our husbands and kinsmen.

Help guide their hearts.
Give them strength.

Their mission is in Your name, Lord.

Please protect them
and return them home safely to us.

They're coming, boys.

Lieutenant Governor Boggs.

I wanna thank you men
for coming out here to meet me in...

Wherever we are.

You all know the need for delicacy
in this matter, given my current office

and the disposition
of our good Governor Dunklin.

Amen.

There's something I thought
you should know.

The Mormons have raised an army

and are marching toward Missouri
even as we speak.

Led by Joe Smith himself.

They are intent on driving us out
of their land of Zion.

Now they say the Mormons crossed
into Missouri three days ago.

Say they're going to kill anyone
who stands in their way.

Since our good Governor is unwilling
to raise the militia to protect us,

it is time for the common man
to rise up in the face of a great evil.

My hands are tied, gentlemen.
I'm asking you to do what I can't do.

Hold steady, boys.

If they want trouble, we'll give it
to them, but we'll not be starting it.

That's far enough.

You're Joe Smith?

What do you want?
This is it?

This is the big Mormon army
we've been hearing about?

If you have business with us,
I suggest you get on with it.

If not, I suggest you leave.

Oh, we've got business
with you, all right.

We got 200 of the best boys from
Jackson County down at Williams Ferry.

We've got 70 coming in from Liberty,
60 from Richmond.

All told, we got...

Let's see, we got...
330?

No.
Let it go, George.

Hey, you'll have your fun soon enough.

That's right.

Let's just go get the others.
Show these Mormon boys how to die.

Oh, by the way,

the number will be around 500 men,
I think,

when we come back.

So, we'll see you soon.

Boys, that's the Mormon army.

Joseph.

We can't fight them here.
I say we march quick time to Liberty.

Forget Liberty.

Let's follow them down to the ferry
and get the lot of them

while they're crossing the Missouri.

That would be sure death.
I agree with Brigham.

We should go right now!
That's enough!

Remember, we are here
on the Lord's errand.

Stand still and see the salvation of God.

First group's across.

Will you look at that?

There's an old church
about a half a mile back!

Get everyone there as fast as you can!
All right.

I don't reckon we'll have any trouble
from those mobbers tonight.

Let's hope not.

Did you see Joshua there?

And?

One of these days you are gonna
have to forgive him, Ben.

I don't know if I can do that.
Yes, you can.

You're being a stubborn fool.

I'm not smiling, Ben.

You say I'm tearing your family apart.
I'm tired of it.

What's tearing your family apart
is your pride.

Humble yourself, Ben.
And forgive your own flesh and blood.

It's hard when the one
who needs forgiveness won't ask for it.

He would never do that. Joshua's a...
I'm not talking about Joshua.

If you hate somebody, Ben,
it is not their fault.

I don't hate my son.
Then act like it.

Stop blaming everybody but yourself.

I'll tell you this, one of these days
you're going to have to make a choice

between your pride and your family.

You have more family in Missouri
than you know.

Letter to the honorable Daniel Dunklin,
Governor of Missouri.

Our situation is critical.

Our people are the victims
of outrages and even murder.

Their property and possessions
have been stolen or destroyed

and their families driven off
their legally-purchased land.

We appeal to you for aid.

Defend our rights
and let peace be restored.

And we will ever pray.

I was told we would be meeting
with Governor Dunklin in his office.

Yes, unfortunately the Governor
was unable to see you.

Asked me to do the honors.

You can be sure you'll be fairly treated
by the Lieutenant Governor here.

Governor Dunklin has committed
to provide us with a contingent

of the state militia to accompany us
back into Jackson County

and to return to us the lands
that were confiscated

on the fifth of last November.

We've come to effect that obligation.

I don't know what you think
you were promised by the Governor

or what you imagine your rights are,

but let me make something very clear.

You will not receive one acre,
not one rifle.

Any Mormon sets foot in Jackson
County with mal-intent will pay for it.

And I speak this with full authority
from the Governor.

And I speak this
with the full authority from God

when I tell you that any injustice
that you mete out upon His people

will be returned upon your head

and the people of Missouri,
a hundredfold!

Mr. Smith, you go in there with force,

and you've got a civil war
on your hands. ls that clear?

We're going to disband Zion's camp,
and return to Kirtland.

We'll see to the needs
of the Saints here

and bring back those who wish
to come with us to Ohio.

Joseph.

Zion will be redeemed,
make no mistake about that.

But it will be in God's time, not ours,

not mine.

What do you want me to do, Joseph?

Thank you, Brigham.

I'll need your help with telling the men.
I'll tell the Saints in Missouri,

but if you could pass word along
to the captains?

I'll take care of it.

This will test their faith, won't it?
Yes.

I believe it will.

Same thing happened to mine.

Why did we come here?

Why didn't Joseph know
this would happen?

Well, who's to say he didn't?

You were there. You heard him.

The Lord would have us redeem Zion
by force if necessary.

Does God just change His mind,
Parley?

God commands and God revokes.

Now, God's revoked.
Just like that?

I wonder what you're expecting
from a prophet.

Why did Moses lead Israel out of Egypt,

only to have them wander
in the wilderness for what, 40 years?

Did he know he'd never set foot
in the Promised Land?

Why'd you come, son?
Because I...

If Joseph would've told you beforehand
how this was gonna pan out,

would you've still come?

Yes.

So, it's not about Joseph. It's about you.

Don't look now, Ben,

but it sounds an awful lot
like you're defending Joseph there.

Ben?

He did try to warn us.

There was no way
I was leaving the other sisters.

It was a long night.

My feet were tored up
something pretty awful,

but those scars are fading.

For a while there, I thought I might
lose Rachel, but she's all right now.

Would you like to go
see your Uncle Nathan?

We've got one of our own.

Named him Joshua.

You know every once in a while,
I catch glimpses of a good man.

I guess that's
who I fell in love with, but...

I do believe somebody can get
through to him.

It just ain't me.

Nathan. Nathan!

Hey!

Nathan.

All right.

Let's try this again.

Are you or are you not a Mormon?

My name is Nate Morgan.

I'm an old friend of Joshua...
An old friend of Joshua Steed's.

Yeah, I know, I got that part.

Ouch. You're gonna feel that
in the morning.

Easy. Easy.

How's Ma?
She's fine.

Melissa's getting married.

And Ma still prays for you every night.

Why did you come?

You're my brother.

What, are you here to save me?
I'm not out to save you, Joshua.

We want you to come home.

Is that all of you?

That's what I thought.

Why didn't you bring Joe Smith
with you, huh?

Can't he solve all this for us?

Or is he slinking back to Ohio with
the rest of the Mormon army, is that it?

If you just went to Pa first, I know...
You didn't answer my question.

Joe Smith going back to Ohio?

I don't know what you have against
Joseph. He's done nothing to you.

Oh, no. He ain't done nothing to me.

Nothing at all.

Nothing except take my family
and my girl in New York.

Lydia was never your girl!
And my wife!

And my daughter here.

No, Joe Smith ain't done nothing to me.

I heard about how Mrs. Steed ended up
with the Mormons.

Pregnant and beaten.
Joe Smith do that?

You watch your mouth.

I saw the scars on her feet

when her and her baby
were forced out of this county!

Old Joe do that, too?
Yeah, I tried to warn her.

You don't know! I tried!

That's big of you.

You know,
maybe Pa was right about you.

Bobby!

I held your daughter tonight.

She's better off without you.

I don't know this man.

But you're right though.
He's a Mormon.

Joshua!

Joshua!

I want to see his face.
Where's your prophet?

Sorry if I caused you pain,
talking about what your son did.

What about you?

If he came back here tonight,
I'd want him to hold his little girl.

I'm not real sure
that he's my son anymore.

You call it what you want,
but he's your son

and her daddy.

Did he ever talk about me?
Maybe one time.

The night I told him I was gonna have
a baby, he got real, real gentle like.

Told me about
when his ma had his baby brother.

It was Matthew.

And he remembered how his ma used
to sing a song to that baby brother.

Somebody used to sing it to him.

He couldn't remember
if it was his ma or you that sung it.

Something about
keeping the angels close

and they'll keep you through the night.
Something like that.

Must have been his mother.

I'm gonna go get some water.

Angels will hold thee

Ben, you better come.

It was my fault, my fault.

Did Joshua do this?

Who did this to him?
We don't even know who brought him.

Did Joshua do this?
Ben, Ben, Ben.

Did Joshua do this?
I don't know.

Ben! Don't.

Ben, what are you doing?
Papa Steed.

Who did this to you?
