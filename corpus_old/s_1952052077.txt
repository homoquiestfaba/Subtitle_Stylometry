Now you all know the rules.

They're over a thousand years old.

And l want you to concentrate
very hard on those rules.

Now...

...is everyone ready for the off?

Put them on,

before they melt too much.
Your Majesty.

Have you all picked your runners?

Yes.

l want every grandchild in this room
to make as much racket as you can.

That one is mine, the one by the fire.

And that one is mine.

And that one is mine.

Ah, Johnnie, have you picked one?
Not too late.

Better hurry up, though, they're off.

All of them are mine.

We'll have that one, then.
l'll choose.

Look, they've started.

Come on. Oh, please, come on.
Please. Please, faster.

Mine's not going. Faster.

Why is mine not winning?

l'm gaining, l'm gaining.

lt's by the fire, that's not fair.

Come on, faster. Come on.
Gain speed, please. Come on.

Faster, come on, keep going. Keep going.

lt's not fair. Mine should be winning.

Oh, Johnnie.
How have you managed to do that?

The party's about to start and look at you.

Grandpapa has butter on him.

Grandpapa has butter all over him.

Now, Johnnie,

you will manage at the party?

You don't feel too tired?

Are you sure?

You promise me?

Your Royal Highness.
We had a little problem but it's gone now.

The Queen has come down already.

So we will be starting on time this year.

lt's nice -- what you're wearing mama.

Grandmama will be wearing a prettier dress.

And that is how it should be.

Your Majesty, a little something
to add to your collection.

Oh, what is this?

Oh, goodness.

Every birthday she gets the same thing,

and manages to sound surprised
when she opens the parcel.

lsn't it lovely?

l've never understood
what she sees in those little animals

can't do anything with them.

... there's my giraffe.

Oh, dear,
we've all managed to bring her the same thing.

Oh, look -- l've got three giraffes now.

Got a clockwork hippopotamus one year,

which l liked.

But l tried to wind it up and broke it.

lf only l could make this disappear

and come back as a totally different present.

lt's my first time as a guest here, you know.
lt's quite exciting.

All the clocks are set half an hour fast.

never expected to see
all the ladies smoking here,

it's -- it's marvellous.

Oh, look, how beautiful.

Your Majesty, it's absolutely splendid.

lt's little fishes.

Extraordinary cake.

No.

There came a bark that blowing forward
bore King Arthur

like modern gentlemen of stateliest port.

And all the people cried;

''Arthur is come again, he cannot die''.

And those that stood upon
the hills behind repeated;

''Come with all good things
and war shall be no more''.

At this a hundred bells began to peel,

but with the sound l woke

and heard indeed the clear church bells
ring in the Christmas morn.

Bravo.

We're getting the oldest
and the youngest today, l see.

l'm not the youngest.

Johnnie is here, you've forgotten him.

l'm sure next year
he'll be doing something too.

(Nuit de joie) by Victor

Hugo.

Johnnie, keep still.

Keep still.

Remember.

Johnnie, keep still.

lsn't the Tsarina going to fish as well?

Georgie.

Why can't l go down?
Just for a moment.

You will see your cousins when
they come to tea, Johnnie. l promise.

Nobody can have given them any advice about
where to catch big fish on the lsle of Wight.

We should go and help them, Lalla,

tell them they won't catch anything there.

l'm sure the Emperor doesn't need
any fishing lessons from you, Georgie.

Don't they look perfectly splendid, Johnnie?

They're late.

Extremely late.

My apologies, my dear fellow.

l thought for a moment
we had come to the wrong place.

Charming. Absolutely charming.

Everything is in miniature, isn't it?

How marvellous to have something so small.

No, l have to stop, l'm afraid.

l have the wrong shoes.

Because underfoot, well, you can see underfoot
it's not quite right for these shoes.

lt's really quite dry. You see?

Er, it couldn't be drier, in fact.

lt's impossible.

l can't take another step in these shoes.

l don't think we have time to send somebody back
to the yacht for some other shoes.

l mean, of course we can,

it's perfectly possible if you want.

That won't be necessary.

l am sure there are some overshoes here.

Overshoes?

Your Royal Highness.

Have we got shoes?

Yes, sir.

But have you got the right shoes?

Bloody ridiculous.

lt's absolutely dry out there.

lf you like animals,
we will bring you a bear from Russia.

Or maybe a tiger from Siberia.

Or maybe both.

l can't get over how different everything seems.

Even Osborne seems to
have got a little smaller.

l used to visit our grandmother,
and also it was a real surprise to me

there are so many houses
belonging to other people so close.

Excuse me.

Are you comfortable like that?

Um, well, um, l'm not sure.

Can you bear it, my darling,
if we do this picture first?

Or maybe we should do
a photograph with you in it first?

What do you think, my darling?

That's the way you behave
when you're an absolute monarch, is it?

Or maybe it isn't the right time
for any photograph at all?

Maybe -- that's what it is.

Your mother is having such a time
with those children.

l've never seen her
have such a time with any children.

He looks like an Emperor fish.

He said he looks like an Emperor fish.

Now how do you think it affected
the power of the barons?

A plague across the entire country.

Can anyone tell me that?

l will tell you what happened
with the Black Death.

lt had a devastating effect
on everything it touched.

And where do you think you're going?

We're just going up to the big house.

We can go on our own.

We don't need anyone with us.

Ma'am.

All these new policemen.

l'm not sure l like finding them
all over the garden.

Johnnie. Johnnie!

You know you can't take that upstairs.

l had no idea they'd been put away up there.

They're going to take ages to lay out.

So, Georgie, your time playing with them
will have to be very short.

Only fifteen minutes at the most.

Oh, at the very most.

So, our commander is Sir Thomas Whitney Whatney
with his three-legged horse.

And that very small and very fat old chap
there is the commander of the French Army.

l thought l heard voices.

Ah, you've got the soldiers out.

Your Majesty.
My word.

Well, let's see what you can do with them.

Now who's got the best position?

Oh, there you are, papa.

l was just coming along to our meeting.

Am l a little early?

You've got the soldiers out.

l hope you're not playing between countries.
Are you?

You know my rules about that.

l told them they had to play between planets,
not between nations.

The armies are from Mars or Jupiter,
that sort of thing.

Never the French or the Germans.

Have you been playing with the French?

Answer me.

No, papa. We haven't been doing that, papa.

The armies are from...

Saturn and Jupiter.

We have been playing with foreigners.

l told you not to do that! Never!

Well, at the least the boy's honest.

Honest Johnnie.

Now that we've got this far,
we might as well help them.

Now stay there, boy,

l need help.

Oh. God... that was difficult.

must be getting old, mustn't l?

Now, they're the French, are they?

Certainly look like the French.

Ah, when l was a boy,
the battles l had with these soldiers, eh.

l fought battles in the desert,
in the jungle, in the snow.

Let's see if l'm as good now as l was.

Everyone ready?

Let's see who can get their men
in the best position.

Right, Johnnie, we're this side.

Now get the cavalry lined up here.

The Dragoons need to be in
an anterior position down there.

We are very late now.

Goodness, if l had known
how long it was going to take,

l wouldn't have agreed to us coming.

My father gave me a good thrashing
every time l was late.

lt was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Georgie -- go back to the cottage.

We'll join you in a few minutes.

Johnnie?

You will be fine. We'll find somewhere to go.

Everything will be fine.

We'll soon be there.

Good evening.

Good evening. - Good evening.

Oh, excuse me. - Oh. Sorry.

Good evening.

Good evening, young man.

Good evening.

We are just coming.

The boy is upset about something.

You will close the door and leave us.

Nobody else will discover us now.

Nobody will see this.

And tonight... we'll say our prayers twice.

Maybe there won't be another one
for a very long time.

Lalla.

Where have you been, Lalla?

l have been wondering why you are so late.

We were just a tiny bit longer
than we expected, ma'am.

This young man has got a cold.

He was sneezing and coughing so very much.

lt's like a little engine, he was.

But he's so much better now.

Good, Johnnie.

l'm glad to hear you're better.

Oh, she's got ears like a bat, your mother.

The very best ears l have ever come across.

l'm not hitting nearly as much as l usually do.

What's happening?

Don't understand it.

What's wrong?

One of the greatest pleasures of my life
and today l hate it.

Meaningless, completely meaningless.

Never thought l'd feel that.

And if l no longer enjoy shooting,

what have l got to look forward
to each night when l go to bed?

l don't recognise half of them.

Did l really invite some of these people?

Why am l so angry
that they're here today with me?

Your Majesty, l am so sorry we're late.

The motor got stuck in the mud.

About time they got a feel for shooting.

Children. Children.

Look, the silly man's got
food stuck in his beard.

Yes.

You can make the food
you don't like disappear, can't you?

Johnnie, it's time for you to sit down now.

Have you ever shot a crocodile, grandpapa?

Oh, l have indeed.

But not today. Not today.

After lunch you will all shoot a crocodile each.

Don't be silly, Johnnie.

Don't be ridiculous.

The ladies will shoot tigers after lunch,

and the men crocodiles.

You know, there was a time when l was
one of the best shots in England.

But today -- l couldn't hit a single thing.

Maybe it's because you're so old, grandpapa.

The boy's right.

That boy is always right.

lt won't be long, Johnnie.

Look up. Look up.

Can you see the comet coming?

ls that it up there?

Any moment it will come, l'm sure.

A bright light in a great rush.

We should be able to see it already.

l don't think it's coming.

Why isn't the engine started?
We have to hurry, for God's sake.

Look, mama and papa.

Will it start?

They must have been called to the palace.

Maybe grandpapa is worse.

Something's wrong with it.

The comet is coming and grandpapa is dying.

ls it an omen?

Johnnie. Johnnie, wake up.

Do you know what that means?

You are the son of the King now.

We both are. We both are, Johnnie.

These will not be seen again.

l'm not sure about the boots.

The boots are very tight.

God give me strength for this.

Well, no.

These are my mother's.

These will not do at all.

Am l a little late?

Ma'am.

Mama, we are over an hour late already.

Oh, don't fret, my dear.

l'm always at least an hour late.

That's what people expect... from me.

No, these will definitely not fit me.

May l join you?

And Johnnie wants to too.

Of course. You look very smart, young man.

Johnnie, come and join us.

lt would be better if all the people
over there weren't in black.

Mmm. You know who that is?

Can you see him?

Standing just by that doorway.

Cousin Bill, the Emperor of Germany.

And how about -- this one?

The person there. He's just moved.

The one by that column.

The King of Greece. Papa's uncle.

And there's Uncle Fritz.

The Grand Duke of -- Mac...
l nearly got it.

The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Who's the one making all the fuss?

That is the Grand Duke
Michael Michailovitch of Russia.

He's a member of your family.

He's just moving over now to talk to
His Serene Highness the Duke of Teck,

who's another of your relations.

Johnnie, it's all of the family together.

Why are they all fidgeting?

l think somebody has called
them much too early.

l wonder who decides
which carriages go first?

And who walks behind the coffin.

Do you have to arrange that?

Oh, no, not today. You don't run today.

Where are you running, young man?

l've got something to do.

You don't know who l am?

Let me think.

You and l have not met but l know who you are.

l'm your cousin Bill.

We are preparing to say goodbye
to your grandfather.

l myself feel great sorrow
because l loved your grandfather.

The whole of Germany loved him.

He was my family after all.

So now you understand, we don't want
to do anything to disturb the family

or the proceedings, now do you?

No, l won't disturb them, sir.

My dearest, l am so glad to be here

so l can express my great sorrow
personally to all the family

and most of all to you.

lt's not because of you we're having
to wait for such a long time, is it?

Of course not.

Well, l have no idea why
we're being made to wait.

He had a very bad turn, ma'am.

l thought it best to wait to tell you
until after the funeral.

Mama.

We will make sure the doctors see him tomorrow.

You must make sure there is
somebody with him at all times.

Of course, ma'am.
l am usually with him all of the time.

lt was just today because it was a special day,

he was with his brother.

lt is even more important
when there are other people around.

Now, John,

can you arrange the animals
in the order of their size?

lf you put the biggest one first,
and the smallest one last.

Can you do that for me?

The biggest?

Please carry on, gentlemen.

l will just sit here.

Ma'am, we've asked John to arrange
these animals in order of size.

The whale, and then
all the way to the insects.

There, now, we've given you a big clue,
young man.

Now let's see you try again.

l used to have a spider.
l used to keep it.

Come on, Johnnie. Please.

Come on, Johnnie. Play.

Come on, Johnnie, do something.

Ma'am, it is clear his brain has not
continued to grow as it should,

showing it must have suffered
some damage at some stage.

And, er, the description of the fits
clearly indicates epilepsy.

Further tests will be necessary, of course.
Yes, of course.

But we have to prepare ourselves.

lt is more than possible that
John's natural life may be cut short.

The brain is very unlikely to develop further.

l can assure you, gentlemen,

that Johnnie is not an imbecile.

The brain is damaged, ma'am,

whatever label we use.

We are recommending complete isolation.

Complete, ma'am.

Where he can be given
round the clock supervision.

John will have regular fits,

and for anybody witnessing those fits,

whether it is the immediate family or,
or people outside the family,

the effect will be most traumatic
for anybody witnessing those.

For the child and for the family this is best.

A quiet place.

A fit in public, ma'am, would not be...

No, no, l'm quite happy
to be right at the back.

No, do not alarm yourself.

l'm quite content with
my position here at the back.

One moment, please.

l'm sorry, one moment.

l think l need a glass of water.

Johnnie? l thought you were with mama.

lt has subsided sufficiently.

Your Majesties.

Well, it's very clean.

So this will be your new room, Johnnie,

and l will be next door.

lt's only a few weeks
until the family will be coming down,

and then you'll all be together again.

For a little while at least.

l think l should have my own bit of garden.

We'll start to make my garden somewhere here.

...feast his neighbour,

And say ''Tomorrow is Saint Crispian;''

Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars,

And say, ''These wounds l had on Crispin's day.''

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,

But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day;

then shall our names
Familiar in his mouth as household words,

Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,

Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,

ln their flowing cups freshly remember'd.

This story shall the good man teach his son;

And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,

From this day to the ending of the world,

But we in it shall be remember'd;

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;

He is asleep.

Mama?

Go to sleep, Johnnie.

Will this work, this arrangement?

Oh, yes, ma'am, it will work,
l promise you. l will make it work.

l will be here with him all the time.

Are you quite sure that is all that is needed?

Nothing else is needed, ma'am, it really isn't.

lt must be understood that any visitors,

either coming here to the cottage
orjust walking in the garden,

no visitors at all must be allowed to see him.

For their sake and his.

ls, is that any visitor at all, is it, ma'am?

Yes.

Don't worry, l will always be here.

l'm making a garden.

l can't see it, Johnnie, it's night now.

lt's not very much at the moment,
but l'm sure it will be.

l will never let them send you away.

So, now, we come again to the
outbreak of the Black Death.

Can you tell me the name of one of the
more important victims of the Black Death?

Can anybody tell me that?

Johnnie, we have done this again and again.

l really must insist on an answer.

Give me any kind of answer.

l don't like the Black Death.

l give up.

There's nothing more l can do.

l thought you were going to teach him
some family history.

Johnnie likes that.

Oh, for goodness sake,
l can't just teach him the last few years.

He needs to know it all.

And he knows nothing.

And l'm locked up here.

l'm as much shut away as he is.

Nobody listens to me.

Nobody could care less!

Nobody knows, nobody cares!

Come along, faster than that.

Come on, you're hardly out of breath.

Come on, Georgie, keep up.

l am keeping up. l'm walking.

Faster.

Why did you speed up every time
we caught up with you?

Come on, Georgie, don't be so slow.
You're always at the back.

Please, once more.

l could hardly keep up towards the end.

Well done.

Excellent.

So, everyone in again.

My turn to go in the front.

Just once, Georgie, just once.

Then it's my turn.

l, er, l never see that nice
little chap Johnnie any more.

Always busy with his lessons, is he?

Hang on to your hats.

Johnnie, your garden's really
very impressive indeed now.

Johnnie, it's time for us to go in now.

Before the guests from the big house
come out into the garden.

Come quickly!

There's been another accident in the kitchen.

Milly. She's cut herself.

Oh, not again. l don't believe it.

Bring Johnnie in now, Georgie.

Come on, l'll show you some of my best plants.

This is splendid, Johnnie.

Good. Just a little further up the path.

Not these ones. Not much further.

They just couldn't believe what they saw.

The King and Queen in that house.

Amazing, isn't it, eh?

D'you know who that is?

Wouldn't look out of place
in Norwood or Surbiton, would it, eh?

A very old General.

No, don't be silly, Johnnie.

He's the Prime Minister.

And his mother all alone in the big house.
She won't move out.

His advisors beg him
to give the place up, so do we.

l mean, what do you think
foreigners make of it?

They come to visit the King
on his country estate,

and find him squashed into one of the
most suburban dwellings in the land.

The King won't hear a word against it.

Another thing they love to do

is fill every room they use...
with photographs of their family.

Hundreds of different photographs staring at you,
you can't get away from them.

Let's cut across here.

You go in, Johnnie, l'll be back later.

Hello. What are you doing
through there, young man?

Who are you?

l'm Johnnie.

l've just left my garden.

Well, good afternoon, Johnnie.

lsn't it a blissful day?

The most perfect garden.

The most perfect day.

Wild West stories, how lovely.

No, no, no, it is my normal reading matter.

Really?

Absolutely.

You'll be surprised quite how many of these
l devour in a month.

l love to look at the pictures,

just like a small boy.

Are you here with your husband?

No.

Oh. Your mother?

Yes.

Choose one for me, Georgie.

Careful now, careful now.

You know which one l like.

The little pink ones, yeah, that's right.

That's a clever boy. Thank you.

Not bad, are they -- the grounds at the moment.

Did you see what's been done by the lake?

lt all looks splendid.

We walked all the way to York Cottage -
a charming view, as always.

Mr Asquith, l'm sure this is a very
misguided question, a silly thought,

but l heard somebody say the other day
there could be a war before Christmas.

Not as far as we know.

Nobody's had the courtesy to tell us.

Put it out of your mind, please.

There is no conceivable way that we'd
agree to participate in a war in Europe.

No forseeable circumstances.

l would be totally opposed to our involvement,

and so would the Prime Minister.

Because they're our family?
ls that the reason?

Not France, of course,
but the other heads of state.

He's an absolute devil
with his questions, that boy.

ls that the reason?

l think we'll just say
how could we argue with that.

That's absolutely true.

Who's that child over there?

l thought for a moment
it was some sort of animal watching us.

Oh, it is our son, Johnnie.

lt is a little surprising to see him over here.

He should be at his studies.

Good Lord, why is he out of the cottage?

Hello, young man.

You know, mama,
we live in a really stupid house,

which is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.

What's more is everybody thinks that -

the servants, the foreigners, everyone.

This man with the huge head said so.

Be quiet at once, Johnnie.

Our house would not be out of place
in a country called Surbiton or Norwood.

And grandmama, silly old thing,
lives all alone in the big house

when she ought to know better.

Ma'am?

So why was Johnnie alone in the garden?

l got distracted for a moment
and he just slipped out.

l'm so sorry, ma'am.

l thought we had an understanding.

Yes, ma'am, we do.

That Johnnie was not to be left alone,
particularly when there are guests present.

l know, it, it will never happen again.

lt cannot happen again.

l know his father was very angry, too.

When Johnnie was small, it was different,

but now these things cannot be allowed.

Yes, ma'am, l know.

lf Johnnie cannot be controlled,

we may have to consider an institution,
as the doctors advised.

That isn't necessary.

ls it, is it, ma'am?

Surely not.

You try very hard with him, Lalla, l do realise.

Each of my children have their strange ways,
l've found.

All children do, l know, yes,

and then as they grow it becomes easier.

Johnnie will not grow in that way.

We know that now and we have to accept it.

Um, with respect, ma'am,

l do believe Johnnie can grow.

l mean, in his mind. Most certainly he, he can.

There's no sign of it so far, Lalla.

But there will be, ma'am.

l'm sure he won't need to be
shut away for the rest of his life.

He will progress.

He's working so hard at his studies,
he really is.

Oh, you two make a fine pair, don't you?

This just won't do.

This just won't do at all.

Johnnie, you can do this sum.

Yes. Yes, you can.

Now... if l have ten jars of blackberry jam

and l take away three...

...how many do l have left?

Johnnie, you are able to do this.

lf you do your arithmetic,
and some of your other lessons,

all sorts of things may happen.

And it's the last time l try to teach the boy in
here with you making all your terrible noises.

There is your great grandmother up there.

ln the middle, yes? Now draw.

Draw the line going down to show
that the Tsarina is her grand-daughter.

A straight line. Straight.
The line must be straight.

That's good, Johnnie.

Now try to do the other one straighter.

l don't know, these drawings are so odd.

Look at this one.

The line of succession.

Here are his father and mother,
done almost normally,

and then the children;

Prince Edward David first, Albert George second.

Johnnie.

So far so good.
But now, why on earth does it go over here?

May and Henry in a funny loop,

and Georgie and John himself right down here
with strange rabbit ears.

lt's a good start.

This will end badly for the boy.

He needs simple things,

just simple things.

No. No that, that isn't true.
ls it, Johnnie?

No. lt just isn't true at all.

Give us what we want. We will not stop.

We will not stop until you listen.
Give women the vote!

They're having difficulty
getting them off, mama.

They'll need to cut them away.

They will manage it, l assure you.

Give women the vote!

We won't have them dangling around for days,

looking at us every time we come out.

lt is quite beyond me how people can make
such a spectacle of themselves.

How on earth do they think
this will do them any good?

Smaller.

Now, think about what you're writing.

Small letters.

My dear Russian cousins,

Olga, Tatiana, Maria...

...Anastasia and Alexei.

l am writing to you after all these years

because l think of you so often.

l will write about my garden.

My garden is a wonderful place.

l feel very happy sitting inside it.

lt is the best garden that l have ever seen.

Many times at night l think...
of your father swimming

and how funny he looked.

My father will see me soon, l hope.

He is very busy being King at the moment.

l shouldn't be here.

This is clearly a bad idea,
a ridiculous notion, trying to do this,

but nothing l could do would make him listen.

But no doubt this young man
would have it all worked out.

Good afternoon.

Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

Hello.

Why is this such a bad idea?

What have you been overhearing now?

l'm just interested.

Your father wanted to see
if he could make a difference,

if he could bridge the divide by
bringing together the parties in lreland.

So he's holding this... conference.

But people don't think
he can make a difference.

l think that may be the general view, yes.

Your Majesty.

Please. Now...

l thought we'd begin...

No, not that one. l, l want the other file.

Now l just have to see...

l don't know... we'll just...

Oh, sorry.

l will need a moment...

Are you expecting news, Johnnie?

lt won't be today, Johnnie.

No, it won't be today, Johnnie,

but it will be soon.

lt will definitely be soon.

Johnnie.

Johnnie, it's come.

lt has come.

lt's the date for you to go to London.

Ah, shall l take that for you?

Thank you.

Now, we are going to go
over a few questions, Johnnie,

so we are prepared. Mmm?

lf they produce those
animal cards again, the doctors,

l'm not sure they will,
because you're so much bigger,

but if they produce the animals

you will remember the insect
will always be the smallest. Mmm?

lt's quite safe
to put that last every time.

Johnnie, listen to me.

Johnnie.

Geography.

They're bound to ask geography questions,

and you do know geography.

What is the capital city of France?

Paris. Or Paree.

Yes, that's right.

And the capital of Russia?

St Petersburg. A German name.

Yes. You can say,
''My cousin the Tsar lives there''.

That would sound impressive.

Yes...

...l will say my cousin Bill, the Kaiser,
has a withered arm.

No. No. No, don't say that.

l know all the questions.

They will be happy with me, the doctors.

Now we are in London,
we must have the blinds drawn.

That was one of the messages
l was sent about this trip.

Johnnie?

Now, John, we want you to take your time
over every question we ask.

l will not need any time.

Who is the Prime Minister of this country?

The Prime Minister of England.

He's a man with a huge head.

And do you know his name?

When l met him,
l was not allowed to say his name

because he'd been very rude

and he wanted to remain my friend.

The capital city of Russia is St Petersburg,

and my cousins, the Romanovs, live there.

The capital city of Greece is Athens,

and my uncle, the King of Greece, lives there.

The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen,

and my grandmama comes from there.

The capital of Germany, where my cousin Bill,
the Emperor, lives is

Er, please, John.
You must wait for the questions.

My name is Prince John.

Your Royal Highness, you must allow us to go
through the list of questions we have prepared.

Very well.

While l'm waiting l will get down.

This room is not bad. Not bad, gentlemen.

This stuffed creature here
is called a scaly anteater,

and it's quite a shy animal.

A shy animal from lndia that lives in holes.

What are you thinking about, young man?

l was just thinking how difficult it must be

to work out where everybody's going to sit
at a banquet like this.

What with so many Ambassadors
from all sorts of countries,

and Bishops and Generals coming.

Not to mention politicians.

How do you decide?

Ah. There are the rules of protocol, of course.

The, er, smaller countries
further down the table,

and then you decide that you might
want to bend the rules a little

because you know, for instance, the Russian
Ambassador has a passion for bird-watching

and so does the Duchess of Bedford.

l expect you're brilliant at that.

Ooh, if nobody takes offence, if the banquet
goes smoothly, then l'll be pleased.

always feel a slight flutter
of apprehension as they start.

Apprehension?

What could go wrong?

Johnnie! At last you've come.

George! George.

l had my own car.
l rode in my own motorcar.

Yes. And l've managed to see to it
that we're staying here tonight.

What do you think?

lt's a great ship -- falling down.

Yes. lt's the biggest ship
of the Canadian Pacific Line,

'The Empress of lreland'.

lt collided in the St Lawrence River
with another ship.

lt just happened, two weeks ago.

lt crashed? The boat?

Yes. And it was an enormous boat, Johnnie.

Nearly as big a ship as the 'Titanic'.

And almost as many people died.

Why are all the big boats
crashing at the moment?

l need to get you to bed, Johnnie. Right now.

Her Majesty will see you now.

Ah, there you are, Lalla.

Your Majesty. He did so well.

You should have seen him. Seen Johnnie.

You know how he usually finds it difficult,

he finds talking a little hard sometimes,
how to reply to people,

well he did it marvellously today, ma'am.

He answered all the questions, and more.

He was quite the proper prince, he was.

lt was a wonderful thing to see.
lf only you'd been there, ma'am.

Now, slowly, Lalla.

l'm sorry, ma'am. l've been waiting to
tell you this and it's rushing out of me.

Yes, so l see.

And the doctors?

Oh, the doctors were stunned.
l think that's right, they were stunned.

They thought he had made progress, did they?

They said that?

They did seem quite pleased, ma'am.

l really think they were.

Of course, l, l don't know what
they'll say in their report to you,

but they must say that.

And Johnnie is here now?

Yes, ma'am.

He's safely tucked up in his bed fast asleep.

He needed his sleep so much,
he's worked so hard today.

Good.

lf you'd heard him, ma'am,
you would have heard something different.

l've never, ever seen him speak like that.

There's still his other illness, Lalla.

The fits. Those will not disappear
and they cannot be wished away.

l know. l know,

but we haven't had one for such a while now.

For such a while.

Ma'am, l can only tell you what l witnessed.

When you next see Prince John, you...

l will see the boy tomorrow.

We have an important occasion tonight.

Of course, ma'am. Of course.

l knew you wouldn't be asleep.

They were worried about arriving too late.

And, look, those people
are worried about arriving too early.

What silly people.

No, Johnnie,

it's because papa's decided to introduce
Sandringham time to here as well.

You know how all the clocks are set
half an hour fast in the big house.

Well now they're doing it here, too,

and nobody knows what time it is.

Coming?

Where am l coming?

We're going to try and see the banquet.

Johnnie, isn't there one thing we have to do?

What?

l think maybe we need
a change of clothes for you.

They have taken my clothes away.

Well, we'll have to see what we can do.

lt's charming, isn't it, this clock.

lt has just rejoined the collection.

lt had been given away, inappropriately,
as a gift,

but we managed to retrieve it.

Oh, Your Majesty.
Please, stop torturing the women.

Why are you torturing the women?

Please, it is our right.

Remove her.

The Queen must listen!

There's no need for alarm.

She has to listen.

Give women the vote! We will never give up!

Everything is simply fine.

lt is our right!

Johnnie.

l hope this works.

Come on, we're nearly there.

lt'll be worth it, l promise.

lt will. l said it would.

Now, Johnnie, stand there and
be careful you're not seen.

l think the Generals have got
too many medals on them.

l just want to work out how he's done it.

There's the Russian Ambassador next to the Bishop
who never stops talking.

And look, Johnnie, Russia's opposite Germany,
cousin Bill's Ambassador.

And the Austrian Ambassador's opposite France.

And look,
Mr Asquith's sitting opposite the Tories

so they can gossip together

because politicians only like
talking to each other.

lt's a perfect plan.

Everybody pleased with where they've been put.

Careful, Johnnie, we mustn't be seen.

Gentlemen.

Your Highness. A bit of a hubbub, isn't it?

A hubbub indeed.

We'll have to play rather loud tonight.

They seem in a rather excited mood.

And why are they like that, sir?

Haven't you heard?

There was an incident between
your mother and an intruder.

And she was magnificent, the Queen, so they say.

Well, that's what everybody's talking about.

Everybody is so thrilled she came to no harm.

Doesn't mama look different. She's smiling.

You will remember, Johnnie,

if the music's too loud,

if anything else happens,

if you feel ill, you will tell me at once.

l am not ill.

You must tell me as soon as you feel it.

Nothing's going to happen to me.

Were you seen?

Johnnie?

Maybe we should leave?

No, l like it.

We've got to go, Johnnie. We've got to go now.

Well, we'll have to make
our excuses to His Majesty.

Head over to Downing Street.

Oh dear, well we shall have to have
this confirmed before we tell the King.

Confirmation is essential.

But this news -- this news might
change everything. Everything, gentlemen.

There you are, Lalla.

Exactly on time, admirable.

This young man here was up very early.

Come here, Johnnie.

l hear you did very well
when you saw the doctors.

The doctors were funny.

And l understand your garden
is making great progress?

You must send me some pressed flowers from it.

Will you do that?

Yes, mama.

Now, l have some news.

Your father wishes to see you,
so we will go...

Ma'am -- l just wondered
if you'd like to see these.

Descriptions in the newspapers
of the incident last night.

lf they're nice l'll look at them.

Well, just to pluck one at random.

The Times, for instance, says your behaviour was
''a masterpiece of dignity and composure''.

l think l might glance at them, yes.

Thank you.

The others were exceptionally nice, too, ma'am.

Also, ma'am, l understand that Johnnie
is to see the King at any moment.

Yes.

We have received news, ma'am,
which l'm expecting confirmation of,

if that comes through
l will need to see the King at once.

Johnnie will see the King.
lt's been far too long.

Come in. Come in, Johnnie.

l've got some of my best stamps out.

Here. Some of the finest l've got.

l thought we could have a look at stamps.

So come here, child.

You see how my collection has grown.

We've got special rooms for it now.

Now, look at these ones.

There's a whole page from Peru.

From Peru, my boy.

Very nice.

No, look properly, child.

You didn't look for long enough.

This one is very rare.

lt's very rare indeed.

And this one is especially pleasing --

it's from Mauritius.

l glance at it every day at the moment.

l come in here and have a look at it.

What are you looking at?

Ah, the bird.

Haven't you seen her yet?

That's Charlotte.

l let her fly about.

Now, what about the Cape of Good Hope?

Have you ever seen a stamp
from the Cape of Good Hope?

How much do you think it's worth?

Have a guess, to the nearest ten guineas. Mmm?

Sir, my apologies, sir.

What? Can't you see l'm busy?

The Prime Minister is on the telephone.

lt is most urgent.

Why is he calling at this hour?

l only saw him last night.

Johnnie.

Have a look at the stamps, Johnnie,

and l'll come back and see
what value you've guessed at.

What do you mean nobody can find him?

He is with his father,

and the Queen said
they must not be interrupted.

Ma'am, Johnnie --
Johnnie must have gone on one of his wanders.

l haven't seen him.

Then we will all go and
look for him together, Lalla.

lt's been totally confirmed?

The Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated.

Where was it?

Sarajevo.

You don't seem very surprised.

When did you know about this?

l am beginning to suspect that quite
a few people knew about this before l did.

Where is he?

My poor child.

Come on, Johnnie. Come on.

ls that what happens?

Lalla's here.

l had no idea.

Lalla's here now, it's all right.

Poor child.

This is my fault.

l got him too excited.

He's overtired with everything.

That's it, that's it.

l know it's a shocking thing to see, ma'am,

but he'll be so much better
so very, very quickly.

That's my boy. Come on, Johnnie.

Come on, Lalla's here. Lalla's here,

that's my boy.

lt's not as bad as it seems, ma'am.

lt's not as bad as it seems.

lt's not as bad as it seems.

lt's clear there was a deliberate decision
not to tell me last night.

That was an absurd decision.

lt appears practically everybody knew about it
apart from me.

How can l work out what this means?

How can l have an opinion on what we should do
if nobody tells me it has happened?!

They will let you stay with him?

They're not going to send him away, are they?

He did so well with the doctors,
just let anybody try.

Where am l going?

Just back to the country, Johnnie.

lf they think they can take Johnnie away,

l'll never let them. Never.

Say goodbye.

l liked the banquet.

When will they be holding another?
