<i>(man) Speech! Speech!</i>

Well, first,
I'd like to thank all of our guests...

for joining us this evening to celebrate
our son Tristan's 25th birthday.

We've been blessed in being able to hold
onto him a little longer than we expected.

And we enjoyed every moment.

But as your time as an undergraduate
finally concludes...

and you move on to graduate school
and beyond...

we hope that you will carry with you
all that we have learned together...

and that you understand that you can
do anything that you put your mind to.

But more importantly, you have the
love and support of everyone in this room.

Happy birthday, Tristan.
Happy birthday, Tristan.

They're beautiful, aren't they?
Look at that.

I hope he doesn't blow this one.

How are those LSATs coming?
The LSATs on the birthday.

Hey. Happy birthday, dude.
Thanks, bro. Cheers.

<i>(man) It's just too easy.</i>

<i>- (man #2) That guy cheats.
(man #3) Do you have six cards there?</i>

<i>- (man) Give me those cards.
(man #2) Count your fucking chips.</i>

Can we go now?
Rose, baby, we're just getting started.

Oh! You gotta be kidding me.

Well, I've had enough poker for one night,
so you can find a ride home.

Keys?

Evan, you've seen the numbers.
This is a good opportunity.

I wholeheartedly agree with you, Ben,
but these things take time.

You know what they say about Rome.
We're not building an empire...

Ben, Ben, slow down. There's still
plenty of time to get all this figured out.

I doubt that my retirement will have
the effect that you seem to think it'll have.

And besides, we have
the whole weekend to talk about this.

So let's just
save it for Pismo. Drink?

Sure.
Yeah.

<i>(Rose) Girls, are you coming?</i>

I think I'm gonna stay.
I kinda wanna learn how to play.

No, you don't. You're coming.
You'll thank me later.

Where are you going?
The mall.

Hey, Allison, isn't this crew a little young
for you to be hanging out with?

You are such an asshole.

You guys are all assholes.
Let's go.

All right. Ante.

Bye-bye.
And they're gone.

Good to see you.

Drive safe, all right?
Take care.

It's time.
Nice.

Where do you think you're going?
I'm coming with you.

I don't think so.
Come on, little guy. Let's go.

Oh, Jesus.
You guys are leaving, too?

Yeah. And you're coming with.
Yeah... Let me just ask the warden.

Don't you get some time off
for good behaviour?

No, man.
Hey, boys. Thanks for coming.

Sir, I wondered if I could borrow
your boys for a couple of hours...

of safe, responsible interaction
with the outside world.

What kind of interaction?

Sir, I'm not gonna lie to you.

Consumption of alcoholic beverages
is probably gonna happen.

But not for this guy.

Dad, it's his birthday.
Hayden, be quiet.

Shut up, Hayden.

Well, can I count on you
to make sound decisions out there?

Of course, Dad.

Well, all right. Get your friends out of here
before they wake up the neighbourhood.

He's such an asshole sometimes.
Who cares? He's let us go out tonight.

Buddy, you're gonna
have a good time tonight.

Where are we going?
Oh, you'll find out...

<i>(¶ hip-hop)</i>

Bro.

Brooke, she's awesome, man.
I get it.

Couldn't you see yourself
with someone a bit less... uptight?

You're only saying that
cos you wanna get at her.

This is true.

Man, look at that little fucker go.

Case in point. You could learn
a thing or two from your brother.

Tristan's got more game in his pinkie
than you'll ever have.

This is true. But Marcus,
we're not talking about your cock size.

All right.
Happy birthday.

Happy birthday, man.
Cheers.

Hello, Tristan.
Hi.

My name's April.

What do you say we ditch these losers
and come follow me?

You know what,
I'm good.

No, no. He's not good.
Go. Go.

Take it easy on him, all right?

Oh, yeah. Yeah!
Whoo!

You're a quiet one, aren't you?

I'll take that as a yes.

So is it really your birthday?

Yeah, it is.

<i>(giggles)</i>

You know,
usually when I do this...

guys get a rise out of it.

Oh, I'm... getting one.

What was that?
Nothing.

You know, if you're gay, I can ask
Javon to come in here and help you.

No. It's just, um...

Don't stop.

Oh.

Dude.
Yes.

Dude.
Yes, Hayden.

We're not going home right now.
Why's that?

We are going to the after-party on the
beach tonight and you're coming with me.

Ah, man...

Dude, a couple of hours, if it's shitty,
we'll leave. They're strippers.

It's a sure thing, it's like the
bull's-eye tattoo, it's a definite.

Right.

Come on, man. Seriously.
Oh, man. You heard Dad.

Oh!

Fuck Dad right now.
Fuck Dad?

Stop taking yourself so seriously.
Lighten up a little bit. Come on.

It's your night off.
Brooke's out of town.

Fuck Dad.
Fuck Dad.

Fuck him.
Just right now. Fuck it.

All right. We're going.
Nice! Nice.

I like where your head's at.
All right.

I don't know where my head's at.

You know I love you, right?
I know.

Oh, dude, it's gonna be great.
I promise you will not be let down.

Come on. Quit thinking
about Brooke for one second.

All right.
I don't see too many people. Let's go.

<i>(¶ rap)</i>

Chill out, man.
You lead the way.

You know whose house this is?
Fuck that. No idea, man, no idea.

I'll get a drink. You want something?
Yeah, all right.

Cheers, buddy.
Cheers. You wanna go in there?

Come on, come on.

Smells good.

What do you mean, why are we here?
We're looking for that schoolgirl.

Are you kidding me?
She was unbelievable.

She's around here somewhere.

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Shit!

Get it.
Mm.

Where are you going?
Come back here.

I don't want to.
What the fuck are you looking at?

Was that some kind of trick question?
Where are you?

Oh, I can't even believe it.

Hey.
This is for you.

Thanks.

No. I'm good.

So, are you guys
with the Wall Street crew or what?

Not really.
No shit.

So, how did you find this place?
My brother dragged me here.

Does your girlfriend
know you're here?

So, what's your deal, huh?

What girlfriend?

The one waiting for you
in some big house in the hills.

The one who you love to death,
but who also bores you to death.

Which is why you're thinking
what you're thinking right now.

Oh, yeah?
And what am I thinking?

Would it be better?

What exactly
do you do around here?

Listen, you might as well drop it.
It's not gonna happen.

Okay.

Would what be better?

You already
crossed the line in your mind.

I'm not such a bad guy
once you get to know me.

Really? I don't think
Sebastian would approve.

Sebastian?
Who's Sebastian?

I'm Sebastian.

Hayden Price.
Nice to meet you.

Yeah, that's cute.
Your first and last name... I like that.

Tristan Price.
That's me.

Sebastian. UCLA.

Sorry, man.
I... I don't remember you.

Come on.
You don't remember me?

<i>Uh... (laughs)</i>

It's my party. Come on.
Let me show you around.

All... all right.

Thanks for keeping her warm
for me there, uh, Hayden Price.

No problem.

What's up, boys?

Tristan.

Javon, Antonio.
Guys, that's Tristan.

How are you doing, Tristan.
Nice to meet you, man.

Drink?
Whatever you got, man.

So, how long
have you known April for?

Actually, I just met her.
I figured as much. Not really your type.

It's a fucking compliment, bro. Relax.

All right. All right.
Well, in that case, thanks.

So, what happened to you, dude?
You dropped out of school or something?

Uh, something like that.

I'm actually in my last quarter now.
And then off to law school if I'm lucky.

Fucking law school.
Yeah, bro, that sounds real lucky.

That kind of reminds me...

I got this LSAT prep class tomorrow
morning, so I should probably go.

Yeah, man. LSAT prep.
Come on. Just stay for a little bit.

Yeah, I wish I could, but...

All right, dude, okay. Well, it's
fucking great to see you again, man.

Yeah. You, too, man.
One more.

All right.

Yo. Later, guys.
See you later, bro.

Your new boyfriend's cute.

Hey, Mr Clean.
Hey.

Having a good time?
Yeah.

Wanna have an even better time?

Maybe.

Trust me.

<i>(¶ "Somebody's Watching You"
by In-Flight Safety)</i>

Any thoughts yet?
About what?

About whether this would be better.

<i>(mobile phone rings)</i>

Hello?

<i>(woman) Sorry. I didn't realise
you were in class already.</i>

<i>I didn't even hear you leave.
Do you know where your brother is?</i>

Uh, n-no.
I... I haven't seen him.

<i>Okay, take care of yourself, we'll see
you when you get back. Love you.</i>

All right, Mom.
I love you, too.

What's up?
Best way to nurse a hangover.

Shit.

Javon.

Man, I... I can't believe
we're still here.

Shit, man,
I can't believe we haven't done this before.

Good times.

Me, too.

<i>(Sebastian) Let's go.
You guys are heading out with us tonight.</i>

<i>- (Tristan) Where to?
(Sebastian) Let's go.</i>

<i>(¶ modern rhythm & blues)</i>

<i>(no sound)</i>

Holy shit.

There must be a badass convention
cracking right now, man.

There's a bunch of badasses in this bitch.
What's up, man?

Man, what's up, Jimmy?
What's the good word, man?

Word on the street is Sebastian has gone
loco. He's lost his motherfucking mind.

Is that right, Dyson?

You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

Javon - name like a nigger,
always think he's bigger,

ready to pull the trigger, huh?

That's the name your momma gave me.
Watch your ass, boy.

Always a pleasure, Jimmy.

Motherfucker, thought
you wouldn't see me again?

You tried to sell me bum shit.
That was bullshit, homeboy!

That shit was fake, homey.

That's right, ese.
That shit was fake.

So check it out, man. I'm gonna slap
the fuck out of both of you bitches...

<i>and take back
my motherfucking money!</i>

That's how the fuck
it's gonna go down!

Do you have a receipt?

You think you're funny, huh?
You think you're a comedian?

Is there a problem here?
Yeah, there's a problem!

He sold me some bum shit! What the fuck
you're gonna do, motherfucker?

Hey. No receipt,
no fucking refund.

No what?
No what, motherfucker, huh?

No fucking refund, bitch!
I'm gonna get my motherfucking refund!

Have a good night.
Have a what, motherfucker?

Yeah, I'll see you in about ten minutes,
motherfucker! Try me, motherfucker!

<i>(whistles)</i>

What's up?
You having a good night?

Yeah, man.
I'm having a great night. You?

Oh, fuck yeah, man.

Get the fuck out!

What's up?
Remember us, huh?

Get the fuck out of here!
I got my receipt now, bitch.

Dude, don't talk to me
when I'm taking a piss.

Wanna see my dick or something?

What the fuck?

Fuck you trying to say, huh?
That we're faggots or something?

Actually, to tell you the truth,
you two do look like a couple of faggots.

Come on.

Hey. Time to go.

What the fuck was that?
Don't worry about it. Go with them.

Come on.
Come with me.

<i>(car lock beeps)</i>

Survival instinct, man.
Some have it, some don't.

And you, my friend,
you fucking have it.

I developed mine the hard way, man.

I had to look over my shoulder.
I never got a break.

I turn my back for one fucking second,
man, I'm taking a dirt nap.

Speaking of which,
you should get yourself a fucking piece.

What? Why? You think those guys
are gonna come after me now?

No, not those fucking guys.
But you never know.

You know what, feel under the bar.
Just feel under the bar.

Yeah, dude.
I got that shit everywhere.

I got shit under the pool table,
in the bedroom, in the fucking shitter.

I got fucking heat
all over this place.

You know what, T?
I got a little surprise for you.

This is from my own private stash.

You won't find this
at any fuckin' frat party.

<i>It is 100% puro.
It is perfect.</i>

You know, man, I really appreciate it,
but I don't really...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You could've fooled me.

You've got the rest of your life to be
boring. You almost fucking died tonight.

Let's take this moment right now,
me and you, and really fucking live.

Yes.

Holy shit.
Yes. What did I fucking tell you?

That's the shit.

Let's roll for a little bit.
Let's go home.

It's all good, Hayden, all right?
Just chill.

We're just gonna
skip class again tomorrow?

I might.

Look, dude, everyone gets back
on Monday. You realise that, right?

Fine. I'm out.
I'm leaving.

All right.
Do whatever you want.

Well, give me the keys.

<i>- Have fun.
(Sebastian) Yo, you're up, T.</i>

Hey, sleepyhead.

Somebody crashed hard.

What?

Did you get any sleep or were you
just up all weekend studying?

Um, yeah...
No, I got some.

Okay.

<i>(engine revs)</i>

Looks like Hayden's taking the boat out.
Oh, yeah?

Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

What?

Uh... nothing.

You know, hold on a second,
I'll be right back.

<i>(Evan) We're having
a little reception here next week.</i>

<i>- You're coming to that, I take it?
(man) It would be my pleasure, sir.</i>

Oh, there he is.
Good morning, sunshine.

Hey, champ.
We were just talking about you.

Oh, yeah?

What are you doing here?

You forgot your wallet
at my place last night.

Honey, how come you've never
introduced us to Sebastian?

I guess it just slipped my mind.

Hey, buddy,
could I talk to you for a sec?

Uh, yeah.

Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Yes, nice to meet you.

Thank you so much
for bringing the wallet.

And, please, feel free to stop by any time.
Thank you, ma'am.

Do you mind if I use your restroom?
Oh, of course, dear.

It's down there and left.
I could...

Thank you.

Tristan, what's wrong?

Nothing, nothing. Um...

<i>- How was the bay?
(Susan) Oh, hot.</i>

Sebastian said you guys
got a lot done this weekend.

With the LSAT?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Um... he was a big help.

Hello.
Hi.

Sebastian.
Brooke.

Are you a friend of Hayden's?
No, Tristan's, actually.

That's strange.
He's never mentioned you.

Well, he spoke very highly of you.

He clearly understated
your beauty, however.

Freshening up on the classics?
Something like that.

Hey.
Hey, sweetie.

I see you met Sebastian.
Yes. Where have you been hiding him?

Uh, it's...

Could we talk?
Yeah.

I'll be right back, babe.
It was nice meeting you.

Hey, so what happened?
How did I get home last night?

Dude, you passed the fuck out.

You were mumbling some shit about
LSATs and the next thing I know, bam.

Me and J had to carry your ass upstairs.

I'm just glad that nobody woke up, man.
It could've got awkward.

Good thing we avoided awkwardness.

So did you have fun?

Yeah. Yeah, I did.

That's good.

So, uh, thanks for stopping by.

Hey, man, we're at the house tonight.
Roll through.

Uh, you know, actually,
I have plans with Brooke tonight.

So bring her by.
You can introduce her to April.

Yeah, right.
Bye.

Later.

I miss this.

Yeah, me too.

Don't you wish
it could be like this every night?

Of course.
Really?

<i>- Absolutely.
(giggles)</i>

Good.

We're taking the body boards out
this week. You down?

I can't. I gotta practise.
Man, he'd rather play with his balls.

<i>- You'd rather play with them, too.
(girl) Doesn't it ever get old?</i>

<i>- Where the fuck were you, huh?
(girl) I didn't see you in class.</i>

I wasn't feeling well.
I just chilled.

Don't get me sick.

<i>(car horn)</i>

I'll be right back.

What's up?
We missed you the other night.

Yeah, boyfriend duty. So what brings you
to this neck of the urban wasteland?

I've got a gift for you.
Oh, yeah? What's that?

Well, it's not here so... come on.

Come on, man.
Just get in.

All right.

So where are we going?

Are you gonna shoot me or what?

You got my back, man?
Do I have your back?

Yeah, dawg, I got your back.

Get out.
Are you serious?

Get the fuck out of my car!
Jesus, Sebastian. I was just kidding.

I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean anything by it.

Yeah, I have your back.

You can trust me.

What are you giving me this for?
It's like I said before, you never know.

Plus, I need you
to back me up on something.

I gotta go to this meeting tonight
and I can't take Javon to it.

Why not?
Look, it's fucking complicated, okay?

I don't wanna be
in this fucking business any more.

So I need to just
back me the fuck up on this, okay?

Yeah.
Yeah, you know, whatever you need.

Good.

So what am I supposed to do with this?
Put it in my pants or in the back?

Do whatever the fuck you want.
They'll take it anyway.

Well, then why am I carrying it?
Better that than your dick in your hand.

All you gotta do is walk in, sit down, and
act like you're not gonna piss your pants.

Are you ready?
No.

Hope you don't mind, gents.
Gotta check you for weapons.

Got company.

Well, if it ain't the mother
of all motherfuckers.

You running low on material, Dyson?

Whatever.

Mr Black,
if this is about the other night...

Keep your hair on, Sebastian.

We're all safe here.

Horse?
Huh?

Why the long face?
Can I get you a drink?

No, thanks.
I'm, uh... I'm good.

Now... down to business.

I heard about your problem
the other day with them boys in the club.

I know the type.

Maybe bought an ounce off you,
spunked it up the wall,

then come back to you
moaning about the quality.

Don't sweat your bollocks about it.
Thanks.

We've had a little organisational shuffle.

Dyson here, he's gonna look after
operations in Southern California.

You report to him,
he reports to me...

and we're one big happy family.

With all due respect...

With all due respect,
you should nod and say thank you.

So where's this coming from?
It's coming from me...

straight back to you.

Clive, show the boys the door.

Congratulations.

So was that good or bad?

Look, man. In this business, you've gotta
learn to read between the fucking lines.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Hello?
Hey, babe.

What's going on?

It's just...
It's just good to hear your voice.

Babe, where were you?

<i>(small scraping noise)</i>

<i>(snores)</i>

Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you gonna shoot?

<i>(laughs)</i>

You fucking pussy.

Really? You forgot?

That bootleg fucking food,

a bunch of dudes fucking scrubbing
their balls in front of you, huh?

Ke-kang!

23 hours in a cell. No?
You remember that shit?

Cos you seem like you don't.

Are you going back on what you wanna
do? I remember and I don't give a fuck.

You got little feelings for him?
Good for you.

Tomorrow, ah, a rap.

And that's gonna solve all your problems?

Shut the fuck up before I put this
in your fucking cornhole, you dirty whore.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Hello?

What?
It's, like, two o'clock in the morning.

You're where?!

Hey, what's up?
What are you guys doing here?

It's time, bro. Get in.
Time for what?

You'll learn more about justice now than
you would at four years of law school.

Law school's only three years.
Shut the fuck up. Don't be a smartass.

I'm not. I'm just saying I can't go
anywhere. My parents are gonna freak.

Your parents will freak? What's that little
thing by the door? Oh, that's your cock.

Shut the fuck up and get in before I wake
up the whole fucking neighbourhood!

All right. Jesus.
Thank you.

So are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

<i>(engine starts)</i>

Where are we?

<i>(rap music)</i>

I made this today
for you and your sister.

Fuck.

What the fuck is you doing?

Can't you see this is my night off?

If you wanna talk some motherfucking
business, we talk tomorrow.

And leave them motherfuckers at home.
I don't wanna talk.

Mostly, I don't want you to talk.
You talk too fucking much.

You got balls all of a sudden, huh?

You know what?
I'm gonna give you a pass.

You know, and I might even consider...

<i>this is one of them knee-jerk reactions
to your fuck up the other night.</i>

You know, I might even be willing
to let you motherfuckers live.

But you gotta convince me.

And you know what?

You gotta tell this motherfucker to get
this motherfucking gun out of my face!

What the fuck y'all looking at?
This is a party.

Motherfucker!

Fucking piece of shit!

Motherfucker! Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

Get off me!

<i>(Sebastian) Check upstairs.</i>

<i>- Have a good time, man.
(Dyson) Get the fuck off me!</i>

Fucking piece of shit.

You fucked up now, white boy.
Black's gonna have your ass.

Yeah?
But first I'm gonna have your black ass.

Tristan.

What?
Come here.

It's time to pop your cherry, T.

Now shoot this motherfucker in the head.

Shoot him.

This motherfucker is a parasite.

Now shoot this motherfucker
in the head now!

<i>- (Antonio) Come on, T.
Come on.</i>

<i>(Sebastian)
Just pull the fucking trigger, bro.</i>

Come on!

Do it!

He's a smart kid.

Why don't you go wait in the car?

You ain't that motherfucking bright,
though, huh?

<i>(Javon laughs)</i>

What the fuck are you doing in the car,
man? You missed all the shit.

Holy shit, you pussy.

Oh, my God.
I just got my dick sucked.

Keep it close.

<i>(mockingly) "Don't kill me"!</i>

Hey, T, hold up.
They teach you that shit in law school?

Na, probably not.

Anyway, you missed the best part, man.

Those girls upstairs, they were
a little timid at the beginning...

but, you know,
once I got them in the mood...

Mm.
Those girls like to fuck.

Hey, T.

Shh.
Don't wake up your parents.

Hey, Dad.

You still up?

Please tell me that we're not
right back here again.

After all the hard work that I've done.

Locked up or cut off.

Those are my choices.

Good work.
I have tried to give you the best life.

What kind of life is that, Dad?

Huh?

I mean, I'm so claustrophobic in here,
I can't breathe.

I'm 25 years old, for Christ's sake!
Then fucking act like it.

What up, T?
Hey, what's up?

What's going on, man?
You look like shit. Get yourself together.

Thanks.

Don't fuck up.

Hey.
Hey.

How you doing?

I'm good.

Hey.

I know you.
Sebastian, right?

Yeah. Good memory.
What are you doing on this side of town?

I just had some business to take care of
and I was just killing some time.

Where are you headed?
Want me to walk you to class?

Yeah, sure.

Did you finish that book yet?
Yeah, I just did.

Well I liked the book, I just... I don't know
I didn't really like the ending.

I just thought that Mondego,
he got off so easy.

If I was Dantès,
I would've made him suffer.

Well, he did kill him.
What could be worse than that?

Well, there are worse things than death.

Sebastian, what happened to Tristan
in his freshman year?

I don't really know
any of his friends from back then...

except for you, I guess.

You know, Tristan will tell you
when the time is right.

I don't know why, but it seems like
he just looks right through me.

I know what that's like, though.
I mean, that's how my father was.

Me, too.

Everything's gonna be okay, Brooke.

Trust me.

I should go.
Okay.

Good seeing you.
Yeah, it was good to see you.

Actually, I might even see you
this evening.

The Prices invited me over
to their party.

I'm gonna see if I can
clear a few things and try to stop by.

See you tonight.

You okay?
Yeah.

You sure?
Uh-huh.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Hello?

Yo, T-bag.

Holy shit, man. Look, you've got coke all
over your fucking nose like a crackhead.

Yeah, get it up.
You brother wants to talk to you.

H-Hayden?
Yeah, H-Hayden.

Where?
He's outside.

Doesn't wanna come in. Something about
being a little bitch or something.

Hey, bro.

Hey.
What are you doing here?

Look, man, don't you think
it's about time to head home?

Mom and Dad
are getting pretty worried about you.

Why don't they just
worry about their own shit for once?

Look at you, man.
This is bullshit.

Just go home,
get you cleaned up, take a breather.

I'm not going anywhere.
Tris, everything's in the balance for you.

You're fucking up your LSATs,
cheating on Brooke.

I... I am not cheating on Brooke.

Then go back to her, Tris.

Don't make me tell her.
You're not gonna fucking tell her shit!

Then pull your head out of your ass, man.
You're fucking it all up!

Come on.
I'm saying this cos I love you, bro.

It kills me to see you like this, man.

Maybe Dad was right about you.

Hayden.

What the fuck you doing out here?
Hayden!

<i>(no sound)</i>

I feel sorry for you, man. That's it.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

I saw Sebastian today on campus.

He was with your fiancée.

Fuck you, Hayden!

Fuck you!

He has never acted like this before.
I mean...

Even in college. He partied and did his
thing, but... He's out of control, you know?

Sebastian has that effect on people.

Why do you stay?

Hey.
Where are we going?

I just thought we needed
a little change of scenery, that's all.

Here.
You left this on the couch.

You're a sweet guy, Hayden.

Oh, that's great.
Exactly what I want to hear.

I mean that in a good way,
a really good way.

And what way is that?

In a way that part of me wants to
tell you to turn around right now...

run away, and never look back.

And the other part?

Wants to run away with you.

Forget about her. Come on.

I'm here now.
Come on.

Here.

Give me that.

Lie down, relax.

I don't know
what's happening any more.

Life goes on
whether you feel it or not.

<i>- (knocks)
(Hayden) Holy shit.</i>

<i>(Javon) You guys are giving me a hard-on.
Holy shit. Get the fuck out.</i>

<i>- (groans)
Did you have fun? Hm?</i>

Hey, hey, man, look, it's not her fault.
Shh.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Hayden, Hayden.

I know when my baby's in love.
It's nice.

The question I have for you is,
what are you gonna do?

Pluck her out of this god-awful existence
and bring her home to your house?

I mean, what? That would be nice,
though, wouldn't it, baby? Huh?

What a dream that would be
to go somewhere...

where no one knows
where you came from, hm?

Hm.

Where no one knew what a fucking
wretched, used-up piece of shit you are.

You're a fucking sick fuck,
you know that?

Stop it.
You shut the fuck up.

<i>(sobs)</i>

You fuck. See, the mistake you made
was assuming that you had any rights.

Maybe at home,
when you have Mommy and Daddy...

you can take whatever the fuck you want.
Out here you're out of your environment.

There are consequences to pay
for your actions.

Now, we started a business together...

so what's mine is theirs,
and what's theirs is mine.

You see the fish on the floor? Mine.

All the other girls
around the house, mine.

Your little stupid bitch-ass brother,
that little fucking shithead is mine.

And if I wanted to own...
Shut the fuck up!

And if I wanted to own you, you'd be mine.
But frankly, I don't fucking like you.

<i>- Oh, wow, did I get cut?
(Antonio) You're fine.</i>

Okay.
Yeah. Let me get a little something.

Yeah, why not?

<i>(groans) Fuck!</i>

Ah, fuck!

Ah!

<i>(spits)</i>

<i>(Tristan) Brooke!</i>

Brooke, wait.

Brooke!

Shit.

<i>(engaged tone)</i>

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Hey, bro. Look, I'm sorry, okay?

Bailey?

Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
W... what's going on?

Price. Hayden Price.

What room?
Room 217.

Oh, shit.

Is he all right?

He's a fucking mess.

What happened?
It's my fault.

I doubt that.

It's Javon.

All right.

Where's Sebastian?

I don't know.

I don't see what the
big deal is about fur...

especially if they're raising them
specifically for that.

It's not like
I'm eating the damn things.

Excuse me.
Have you seen my dad?

Um, yeah,
I think he's in the back yard.

Thanks.

Hey, Mrs Price.
Oh, good to see you.

How are you this evening?
Very well, thank you.

Wonderful.
Oh, uh, this is Allison.

Allison.
Nice to meet you.

Very nice to meet you.
I'm glad you made it.

Would you excuse me a moment?
Oh, of course.

Thank you. Hello?

<i>(woman) 911.
What's your emergency?</i>

Come on, Brooke.
Come on, pick up.

<i>- (engaged tone)
Dammit!</i>

Brooke.

Oh, hi, it's you.

Are you all right?

<i>(sighs)</i>

<i>- (phone rings)
Oh, thank you.</i>

Excuse me. Hello?

Tristan. Where are you?

I don't have time to explain.
Is Brooke there?

Yeah. I think I saw her with Sebastian.
What the fuck is he doing there?

That's quite a mouth on you these days,
even your father's been cursing a lot lat...

Okay, okay, okay.
Look, I'll be right there.

It's gonna be okay.

<i>- Everything's gonna be all right.
(sniffs) Okay.</i>

Come on.

Brooke.

Brooke.
Hey, now's not the time.

Are you fucking kidding me?
Get out of my way, asshole.

Don't say things you'll regret.
You know what I won't regret?

Tristan!
What in God's name is?

Tristan, what're you doing?

Your parents are throwing a nice party.
Let's not...

Shut the fuck up! Tell them.

Tell everyone here what you did.
You stop this at once!

You can't reason with him.
It's the drugs talking.

Jesus Christ.
I figured as much.

<i>- Hayden's in hospital. I'm being set up.
(sirens)</i>

Why the fuck are you doing this to me?
Tristan, put the gun down!

Jesus.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Someone call an ambulance!
Oh, God!

<i>(policeman) Put the gun down!</i>

<i>- (Susan sobs)
Put the gun down now!</i>

<i>- (Susan) Oh, God!
(drops gun)</i>

<i>(Tristan) Dad.</i>

<i>- Dad!
(policeman) Get off him.</i>

<i>(Tristan) Dad.</i>

<i>(cell door slams)</i>

<i>(knock at door)</i>

<i>(sighs)</i>

Hi.
Hi.

Um... I... huh...

I hope you don't think
this is inappropriate. I just, um...

I just wanted... I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

Thanks.

I... I'm sorry.

That's really sweet.

<i>(sighs)</i>

I... I'd ask you to come in,
but it's not really the best time.

I was just wondering, uh...

you don't want to get out of here, do you?
A walk, a drive or something?

Just maybe, you know...

Uh...

Sure.

Yeah?

Let me get my purse.

Thanks.
Any time.

It's just everything I do, wherever I go,
I just can't stop thinking about him.

I guess you never really know
another person, huh?

I just...

want to stop thinking about it.

Him, me...

just everything.

I have an idea.

What?

Well...

it's a surprise.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it's serious.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Hello?
Mom?

Tristan.
Hey, Mom.

<i>Hey.</i>

How are you?

Look, I... I'm fine. Uh...

Look, I...

<i>(sobs)</i>

I just wanted to...

How's Dad?

Um...

he's sleeping.

He was lucky.
The bullet just went straight through.

Is he gonna be all right?

Yeah, yeah.
No, the doctor says he'll be fine.

Have you heard from Brooke?
No, uh, not in a while.

<i>- (coin drops)
(sobs)</i>

Honey... um, that was Tristan.

I don't know what to tell you except
that he sounded really distraught.

He better well be.

He should be happy
I'm not pressing charges.

Oh, Evan.

I didn't raise any criminals.

And I don't care what you think.

That boy is no longer my son.

Will you listen to yourself?

If you hadn't have pushed him,
none of this would have happened.

You just pushed him and pushed him
until there was nothing left.

Don't you see that?

God, if you always expect people
to disappoint you...

then eventually they will.

<i>(door slams)</i>

Price. Someone's here to see you.

Look, Mr Ryan,
I want you to know how sorry I am.

I know.
How's Brooke?

Well, that's part of the reason
why I'm here. No one can find her.

She's not at her apartment, she's not
answering her phone. But we'll get to that.

They've got a murder weapon with
your prints on it, and you have no alibi.

Everything they need for conviction...

except motive,
and that's easy to fabricate.

Well, for what it's worth,
I'm innocent.

There's also the matter of the girls.

Oh, Jesus.
Why are you showing me that?

Because they found DNA that's not yours,
and I think you know whose it is.

There's something else
I need to tell you.

Michael Cole...

also known as Sebastian Cole.

I should've recognised him.
I... I don't understand.

He took the fall
for the Jaime Pierson incident.

He was her drug dealer.

I know you weren't privy to the details.

He served a couple of years.
Oh, Jesus.

I think that's why
he's setting you up.

<i>(sniffs)</i>

I bet you anything
he's with Brooke right now.

You remember those strings
I talked to you about pulling?

Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna pull them for you.

This is the last time I'll be able to.
Do you understand?

Yes, sir. I do.

They're getting a warrant for his arrest,
but it's gonna take time. You find Brooke.

They're gonna release you.
Your car's outside. You find her.

Then we can sweep this
all under the rug where it belongs.

Okay.

<i>- Are you off your fucking trolley?
(man moans)</i>

You steal from me, you steal from God.
Would you steal from God?

No. No.
No, but you think you can steal from me?

Hi.

Just wait one minute.

Arh!

<i>(man groans)</i>

Have we got an appointment?
No.

Clive, why have you brought this fucker
in here? Are you trying to get a rise?

He said it was important.

He said it was important.

Next time some sniffer from Malibu
comes in and says it's important...

ask me if it's fucking important, okay?

Fine.

I need your help.

You need my help?
Yeah.

Now, let me get my head round this.

You wipe out one of my boys...

you mess up his bedroom...

and you steal my bread and honey.

Your what?
Money, honey.

Then you have the bollocks
to walk in here...

and ask me for a favour! You've got two
seconds to tell me what's on your mind.

I need you to help me
kill Sebastian Cole.

Why didn't you just say so?

He's trying to frame me.

I know.
Then why are you threatening to kill me?

Everybody needs a hobby.

What about you take my boys
and you go and bury this fucker?

Let me tell you this.

You fuck this up and you're dead.

If the boys think you're gonna
fuck this up, you're dead.

In fact, my friend, it's gonna be
very hard for you to stay alive.

Got it.
Now...

fuck off.

Clear this up.

To new beginnings.

Remember you asked me what happened
to Tristan, freshman year UCLA?

It doesn't matter now.
No, you should know.

He was dating this girl.

Jaime Pierson.

She was a party girl, wild,
the type of girl that would do anything.

Tristan threw one of his signature bashes
and Jaime swallowed a speedball.

OD'd, died right on the living room floor.

Oh, my God.

I'm sorry.
I didn't really mean to kill the mood.

Quit touching me.
Shut the fuck up.

Where's Sebastian?

<i>(no sound)</i>

<i>(gasps)</i>

You're gonna be okay, alright?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

You're going to be all right.
I'm sorry.

<i>(sobs, groans)</i>

<i>- Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
(whispers) They're at the marina.</i>

What?
They're at the marina.

Jesus Christ.

<i>(sobs)</i>

Oh, God.

Do you think that he did
what they say he did?

I hope not. I mean,
it's one thing to kill a drug dealer...

but what he did to those girls...
What girls?

They found the murder weapon
in his glove compartment.

I thought that the gun
was in his hand.

Why don't we take the boat for a spin?
I'll teach you to drive it.

No, I should be going.
It'll be fun. I'll have you home by dinner.

No, I... I mean, this has been
really great, but I should really go, okay?

Um, no, not okay, actually.

Just get back inside now.
Stop it, you're scaring me.

<i>- You know what? Bitch.
(gasps)</i>

Let's go.
What are you doing?!

<i>(Brooke screams)</i>

<i>(Tristan) Brooke?</i>

Why are you doing this?

<i>(groans)</i>

Hey, Brooke.

Your boyfriend's here.

Leave her alone!

Move! Get the fuck up.
Come on!

<i>(groans)</i>

Who's gonna fucking bail
you out now, Tristan? Huh?

<i>(groans)</i>

Stop!

Why are you doing this?

Your daddy and his friends
had me put away for five fucking years.

<i>(screams)</i>

You son of a bitch!

What are you gonna do?

People like you
don't have the fucking balls.

<i>(shouting)</i>

Fuck you!

<i>(cocks gun)</i>

<i>(man) All clear.</i>

There's no one here, boss.

Someone's playing fucking
games with me.
