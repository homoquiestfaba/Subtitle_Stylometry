[crowd cheering]

It's gonna be a brutal night
in all the best ways possible.

Are you ready my friend?
Chris, let's do this.

Are you guys ready?

[crowd cheering]

I thought so.
Faruq, take it away.


Are you ready?

It's robot fighting time!

<i>Automatic qualifier tonight</i>

<i>But after an early exit
in last year's tournament,</i>

<i>They're coming in with
a chip on their shoulder</i>

<i>And on a mission
to remind the world</i>

<i>That this robot is one
of the heaviest hitters</i>

<i>In the history of the sport</i>

[crowd cheering]

Back in 2019, our rookie season,

We actually had our first ever
<i>battlebots</i> win against end game.

So, this is kinda
full circle for us.

The team is definitely ready to
have three fights in a single day.

However, the tournament
is kind of insane

Because all the bots in the
tournament are so destructive.

Tombstone, hypershock,
the bots all hit so hard.

The bots, all have the
ability to fully retire our robot.

Luckily, we did
bring a lot of spare,

So hopefully we'll be ready for
each match that we have to fight.

But it's a big deal.

So, we're playing ribbot
in our first fight today.

And they're modular
robots, they could be running

A horizontal spinner
or a vertical spinner.

We know what we want 'em to play

And we have kind of a back
up plan for if we're not sure.

It's really important for
us to win this golden bolt.

I think we've got the best
robot in the world right now,

So we want the
opportunity to show it.

All right.

Nick mabey, jack
barker, congratulations.

Wow!
Thank you, thank you.

Got another one of these.

Hey, jack.

Were you a little ticked
off that ribbot came out

With the shades on their frog

And they were trying to
get under your skin a bit?

Well, last time they
came out with the shades,

They absolutely
kicked our butts.

So, we just needed to
make sure that, you know,

We keep the shades

And just smash them
up even after the fight.

Yeah, that fight went pretty
differently from last time.

You guys came out with
those forks and then you didn't.

Talk about that a little bit.

So, like, we know
what they can do.

They can either be
a vert or a horizontal,

So we went for the wedges.

But if they were
gonna go for the vert,

We put on a little contingency.

And, you know, we saw that
they were running the horizontal,

So we don't need those
anymore, we'll get rid of them.

And just gonna give them away
and they're gonna count for damage,

So we'll smash 'em up
before the fight starts.

you play chess out there.

All right guys, congratulations.

Thanks.
Thank you.

<i>And in a very short
time, it's gone from</i>

<i>To one of the deadliest.</i>

But it's a tough
draw for 'em tonight

Because in their two
matchups with skorpios,

They have dropped both of them.

<i>With virtually no

<i>And inspected every

<i>While winning the
world championship</i>

<i>Is their ultimate goal,</i>

<i>Taking home the golden
bolt would catapult this squad</i>

<i>Into elite territory
here at</i> battlebots.

<i>They are not taking this
opportunity for granted.</i>

[crowd cheering]

So, originally when
I got hypershock,

I was like, "dude, I've
already done this twice.

The fans aren't
gonna wanna see this."

But then I watched his
footage from this season

And, oh, my god!

Will finally fixed it.

This is not the same
hypershock I have fought.

And I'm gonna need
a few new tactics.

My big goal is to
get him upside down.

And I'm hoping if I just fling
myself into the blade long enough,

He'll flip over, I'll flip over.

The difference is
I can get back up.

They're the best wedge in
the competition, bar none.

They have the best, you
know, ground game upfront.

You know, in terms of armor,

They always have little
attachments to put on.

We will not get under it,
at least not from the front,

So I have to do a very good job

Of being incredibly patient

In getting our
forks under his side.

Or under the back or
under a wheel or something.

But that's the only
way we can deliver a hit

And that's what we gotta do.

But this place went

Yeah.

[crowd cheering]

I was not aware
scorpions could fly too.

[all chuckling]

I'm frankly a bit surprised
that we got under the front

And got those hits in.

They are the definition
of floor scraping

And perfect front end,
so must be a lucky shot.

-And then we bent it up...
-[person in crowd] I love you, will!

Thank you.

So, I'm really sorry about
picking this particular door,

It's like the door to

It's a nice door.

You've become the

Congratulations, thanks for

Win number five in a
row. It's feeling good.

Feeling good.

That was much quicker
than we anticipated it to be.

But once again, not a scratch.

Not a single blemish on the top
armor or the side armor or anything.

It's just the weirdest event.

We've gone five for five
now with some serious robots.

And no one has
damaged any armor.

No one.

about this bot's</i>

kyle miller would tell you,</i>

<i>He's as surprised as anyone</i>

<i>To be sporting a
7-0 lifetime record.</i>

<i>But facing witch doctor,</i>

<i>He understands the
symbolism of this match</i>

<i>What I'm looking
for is whether or not</i>

<i>The team has addressed
glitch's mobility issues.</i>

<i>There is very
little room for error</i>

<i>Against a driver as
skilled as mike gellatly.</i>

[crowd cheering]

Their weapon is looking,
like, very powerful,

But they seem to have
pretty unreliable drive.

But the people that
have lost to glitch,

Drive straight
into their weapon.

We are gonna be very patient.

I know it's only three minutes
and it feels like an eternity,

But we're gonna make them
engage us if that's what it takes.

If you don't move,
you get counted out,

So we're gonna take our time

And make sure that
we land the hit we need.

We're doing our best that we
can to get our drive working.

Not really been the
case in a lot of fights,

But we really need it.

We're gonna do our best to keep
our weapons pointed towards them

And try to hit them
whenever we can.

It's kind of a chance to prove

That we could have gone
farther in the round of 32.

That we would have had a
great fight against witch doctor.

And we could have beat them.

So, this one's personal for us

And we really
wanna take 'em down.

Hi.
Hi.

Hey.
Congratulations.

Thank you.
What was the idea behind

Being so patient
there at the beginning?

So, I mean, glitch is a
very innovative robot.

They have this really
cool driver where they can

Translate and drive around.

They're 7-0 I
think at this point,

So we did not wanna drive
right into their weapon, obviously.

They had huge,
huge hits this year.

And it looks like they
actually were driving

Super well in this match.

Better than they have
in any other match,

So we weren't sure how
well they'd be able to translate.

And I knew I needed to
stay out of the path of that

Monstrous weapon.

Mike, you went with the
forks configuration there.

Finally.
Are you happy you did that? Yeah.

Satisfied?

Yeah, I mean, we got
hung up in some of the

Saw slots a few times there.

But glitch is so low, you know,

We figured this is like
the perfect opportunity

To use 'em and I think
they worked pretty all right.

Andrea and mike gellatly, team
witch doctor, congratulations.

We'll see you in the
semi-finals against hypershock.

Thank you.

<i>And let's just say
it was memorable,</i>

<i>But for all the wrong reason</i>

not only knocked tantrum out,</i>

<i>It ripped its fists off</i>

<i>And embedded
it in the battle box.</i>

<i>Alex and ginger told
us the whole thing</i>

<i>Was a little embarrassing</i>

<i>And that they've been
waiting for a rematch</i>

<i>With ray billings ever since</i>

finall gonna get it tonight,</i>

<i>But much like this is
a vast different tantrum</i>

<i>Than the last time
these two fought,</i>

<i>We may now be talking
about a different version</i>

<i>Of tombstone as well.</i>

<i>Dare I say</i>

That tombstone has a little
something to prove to everyone tonight.

I think they do.

<i>Ray billings is obviously a
legend and a former champion</i>

<i>But tombstone 5-5
in its last ten fights</i>

<i>And the</i> battlebots <i>worl
is starting to openly wonde</i>

<i>If the king of kinetic

<i>Ray's made some significant changes
to the weapon in the past few years,</i>

<i>Searching for even
more knockout power.</i>

<i>I think that has led to
some inconsistency,</i>

<i>But this is still one of th
hardest hitting robots in the world.</i>

<i>I think that beefy
armor on tantrum</i>

<i>Will be tested.</i>

Ray billing says don't
underestimate us.

Everybody should
still be afraid.

Let's see for ourselves. Faruq.

<i>How have they setup tantrum to face

<i>You see that front wedge there,</i>

<i>That was designed specifical</i>

<i>To defend against
horizontal spinners.</i>

<i>They wanna use it to
jam up tombstone's blade,</i>

<i>Then drop it into
attack mod with their fist,</i>

<i>That sliding vertical disc spin.</i>

I believe that I can
beat them in this match.

We're gonna be hitting
'em a little harder than

They've been hit up
to this point in time.

He'll have some sort of big
steel arrangement on the front

To try to stop the spinner,

So he can corner me and
get his weapon into play.

So, my strategy is gonna
be I'm gonna have to try to get

Away from the arena
wall as quickly as possible

And try to just keep fighting
in the center of the arena.

'cause if he gets me pushed into
a corner, I'm gonna be in trouble.

It's gonna be a great tough
match between two champions

And I'm looking forward
to getting in the arena

And doing our thing.

I think this is a sort
of an inflection point

For tantrum

To prove that we are part
of the big leagues now.

Tantrum is not who we
were three seasons ago

When we first fought tombstone.

And this is really,
the difference in fight,

I think will show the
world how far we've come.

To prepare tombstone, we added
some gruff bars to the front of our robot.

Gruff bars are what
we call really strong

Steel bars that
we add to the front,

So that we can knock
tombstone's blade in half.

All right, we got this.
Let's go, tantrum.

Alex and ginger,

What a run tantrum has been on.

It is a run.

You win the giant nut.

You take down a
legend in tombstone.

What is going on here, ginger?

I mean, in tantrum's
first season,

We had to actually go
up against tombstone

And we were
hobbling into that fight.

I mean, I think we only had
half of our drive train working.

It was a rough year for us.

So, to be able to come back now

And be able to
take tombstone out,

I mean, it is an
incredible feeling.

Honestly, it's amazing.

We are back on

The chase for the golden bolt.

<i>It is time for our first
semi-final between</i>

<i>Hypershock and witch doctor</i>

<i>This is a dream matchup.</i>

<i>On one hand,
you have will bales,</i>

<i>Who electrifies the crowds.</i>

<i>He's captained hypershock
through one of the most</i>

<i>Insanely destructive winnin
streaks in recent memory.</i>

<i>Then there's witch doctor,</i>

<i>Perennially in its prime.</i>

<i>Captained by the iconic duo
of andrea and mike gellatly</i>

<i>These two squads actually
share a shop together in florida,</i>

<i>So they're very familiar
with each other, kenny.</i>

And now, they're gonna
destroy each other. I love it.

<i>You know, witch doctor
obviously has the pedigree</i>

<i>And they had no problems earlier
with the rookie juggernaut, glitch.</i>

<i>But no one has been
as hot as hypershock</i>

<i>Throughout this tournament.</i>

<i>In the first round they had
skorpios out of the arena</i>

<i>In ten seconds flat.</i>

Will bales has been
a man on a mission.

<i>This is a kind of fight you
pay good money to see.</i>

In the blue square,

Ever had a case of the mondays
where you're feeling out of whack?

Well, will bales will
make you hate every day,

Like a boomtown
rat with a broken bat.

The silicon chip inside his head

Has been switched to overload

And now you'll have

Hypershock!

[crowd cheering]

Hypershock is like one
of the fastest robots here.

Will's one of the
best drivers here.

But we're hoping
he'll make a mistake,

You know, he's overconfident.

[chuckles] will bales?
Yeah, he's pretty much the epitome of overconfidence.

Hypershock's gotten some
huge ko hits and so have we.

So, it's going to be a huge
slugfest between two robots.

It might not be a long fight,

But there's guarantee
there'll be some crazy air-time.

We have these rally long forks

And we spent the whole
off-season complaining with them

About how wedge
lids are killing the sport

And forks are killing the sport

And they made some
little ones, I'm like,

"rats, I need to make some too."

And we threw them on and
they've been working like a charm.

So, guess what
you're getting mike?

It's going to be a
heck of a match.

My goal is to set
a high fast paced,

You know, event here.

And do a good, solid
drifting clinic on 'em.

Andrea!

What was it like watching
your husband run roughshod

Over your good friend,
will bales and hypershock?

I have to tell you, we did not think
that match was gonna go that way.

Witch doctor has
had so much damage.

We did not know
how it was going to go.

And will bales is
an incredible driver.

His robot's so fast.

I think we shocked ourselves
as much as anybody else.

Hyper shocked, you could say.
Hyper shocked.

[mike chuckles]

It was a crazy fight.

At one point, you
took one of his tires off.

It actually got stuck.

It was jamming up
your primary weapon.

How nervous were
you guys at that point?

Well, I was trying to
dislodge it with the weapon,

But the weapon's spins in a
direction that lodges it further up,

So mike was trying
with the self-righter.

We talked about
going to the hammer

And try to see if the
hammer could get it out.

But just hitting him, he
took it out for us, I think.

[all chuckling]

Congratulations.

We'll see you in the
final of the golden bolt.

Thank you.

they popped your wheel off?</i>

I'm fine.

You know, I'm happy someone
finally gave us some damage

In this competition.

We went...

We just got out of our

We got a really fast turnaround.

We took massive
hits, you can see here,

Chunks of our armor

And our weapon
is also not spinning.

<i>We said it earlier tonight,</i>

<i>This tournament
is a war of attrition.</i>

<i>Kenny, tantrum is a bot
that can take a beating</i>

<i>And keep on ticking.</i>

the first thing I think of</i>

Is they are unkillable.

Doesn't matter what
you throw at them,

They find a way to
survive, keep going.

back in the semi-finals</i>

<i>Of the 2020
championship tournament,</i>

<i>Tantrum was flipped by
end game and counted out.</i>

<i>They've since
added a self-righter,</i>

<i>So they're not gonna
make anything easy</i>

<i>For the former world
champs this time around.</i>

Did you say that
tantrum's unkillable?

Because I think that jack
barker and nick mabey,

<i>The co-captains of end game</i>

<i>Their ears kinda
perked up a little bit</i>

<i>'cause they're
like, "wait a second.</i>

<i>We got a great weapon
that c kill just about anything."</i>

Including your dreams, kenny florian if it must.
[kenny laughs]

How's it gonna do
against tantrum?

Well, what's the key
here for end game?

Well, listen, if there's
one weapon out there

That can do some
serious damage to tantrum,

<i>It's probably end game.</i>

<i>You know, if it wasn't
for a vintage performance</i>

Once upon a time in hollywood,

This team won the giant nut.

Now, these natural

And they're kicking butt.

They were death proof before

Now it's the same story

Except they're dressed
like the reservoir dogs.

By the way, did you
know that in new zealand,

They call the golden
bolt a royale with cheese.

[crowd cheering]

In our fight against tombstone,

We took some really serious
damage to our weapon.

Usually, you have a bit of time

To fix the robot in
between matches,

But we're flying by
the seats of our pants

Just trying to get
everything working

And we're really hoping
we're kicking at full power

In the end game match.

End game is a beast.
We're definitely scared of 'em.

They're a hard hitter and
it's not gonna be an easy fight,

But we do think
we have a chance.

We've noticed in the past,
they like to circle their opponents,

Wait for them to make a mistake

And then get into the side.

We're gonna make sure
that we don't let that happen.

We've got a big weapon up front.

They can't compete
with that with theirs,

So they're not gonna

But we're gonna make sure
that it's always facing them.

Tantrum won the giant nut
in 2021 and that's awesome.

But they didn't beat
us along the way.

So, we wanna prove
that if we had their run

And they had to
play us along the way,

Then we would have
an answer to them.

<i>Nick, how did you win
that brutal battle tonight?</i>

My god.

We were not expecting
such a, like, brutal fight.

My heart's pounding still.
[all chuckling]

This is a battle of
attrition, guys, as you know.

That was a brutal fight.

Can you go in there and rebuild?

We gonna have to.

There's definitely
some stuff broken, like,

You've probably damaged us most

This entire year.

So, we'll check it out and
we'll get back in the box.

Sounds great. We'll see you in
a little bit against witch doctor.

Thank you.

[crowd cheering]


Hi.
Hello.

First time that you guys
have lost as co-captains.

Alex, this is weird.


To lose to end game,
like, in that sort of a bout.

Like, tantrum just kept kicking.

Self-righter worked
more than once.

[all laughing] -
mind you. Yeah.

And it's great. I'm
excited. It was a good bout.

Ginger, what was the
difference in that three minutes?

I mean, tantrum
went all the way.

We were agile, we were
running around the box

And, you know, we were
even able to control end game

A little bit towards the end

When their weapon
was slowing down.

It's okay. This is
another lesson to us.

And we're gonna be, you
know, that much better next year.

Congratulations
on a remarkable run.

Thank you.
Thank you.

It's our third fight of the day.

It's been a really,
really intense day.

Nothing.

Still nothing.

we took a lot of damage.</i>

<i>We kinda smacked them about</i>

<i>But everytime we hit them,
we take that force back into us.</i>

So, in that fight,
we sheared the bolts

That attached the
weapons, the pulley.

<i>And we also had an issue
with weapon electronics.</i>

<i>One of our custom
features on our control board</i>

Has stopped working.

<i>So, we've replaced them.</i>

We are about to roll into
the box and hopefully,

Everything goes
right. We have no idea.

<i>At the end of this grueling
push towards the golden bolt</i>

So, what are you
expecting to see tonight?

Yeah, absolutely,
just to get here

Is a huge accomplishment.

<i>And taking a look
at the numbers,</i>

<i>You can see just how
close this matchup really is</i>

<i>Both bots are quick and agil</i>

<i>Thanks to their
impressive drive trains.</i>

<i>And while end game have
significantly lighter armor</i>

<i>Let's talk about where
that weight is distributed.</i>

<i>Witch doctor carries most of
its ar 500 steel armor up front.</i>

<i>While end game
spreads its hardox steel</i>

<i>Out over the entire frame.</i>

<i>And yes, end game
has the bigger weapon,</i>

<i>But if these two
discs collide head on</i>

<i>The only thing that's
guaranteed is chaos.</i>

<i>These are two of the heavies
hitters in the history of the sport.</i>

<i>Buckle up.</i>


Can you show 'em
what they're gonna win?

Let's go, muscles. Come on!
Of course, I have to pick this up.

Show this thing off.

Here we go. Huh?
Look at that.

The first ever.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Are you ready?

The winds whip wildly around
this wicked witch of the east.

There's a big storm coming

And that's just fine
for this vicious beast.

Because she's
stronger than a tornado

And quicker than a twister.

So, you better show
heart, brains and courage

Or she'll drop a
house on your sister.

Dorothy, I don't think we're
in the battle box anymore.

Give it up for witch doctor!

<i>They're going with their

<i>As always nick and
jack believe that they can</i>

<i>Win the battle for low groun</i>

<i>That legendary weapon

[crowd cheering]

We already faced end game
once before in the fight card

And it didn't go our way.

We're gonna use the
same strategy again

And I think we've
fought a lot of robots now

That fight the way end game does

And kinda sits at the
center and aims at you.

We're actually using our
single disc configuration

That we've been using
these last few fights.

So, which is different than
our first fight against end game,

So maybe that will
give us an advantage.

We'll have to see how it goes.

So, the tantrum fight
was actually really hard.

We lost a couple
of speed controllers,

So we had to, like, swap
them out with entirely new ones.

Ones that we actually
haven't run before.

So, it's a little unknown,

We're little nervous
about the fight.

Mike is obviously
a really good driver.

They made it to the finals of
the 2021 giant nut tournament.

And, you know, we did beat
them in the qualifying round there.

I think they're really
on form at the moment.

Coming through this tournament,

It's gonna be real hard
to try and avoid his attacks

And try and get under him.

Here we go.
