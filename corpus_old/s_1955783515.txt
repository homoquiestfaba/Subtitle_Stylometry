KICK BOXER
RETALIATION

What a great opportunity
this is for Kurt Sloane,

stepping into the last minute.

With Hoskins out on a back injury,
this could go either way.

At this point, Renzo, I
don't know what to expect.

He comes, he wins, he
disappears, he's back.

I'm completely confused.

He looks like he means business.

"Did you see that?"
Wow!

Man, you gotta love this guy.

Ladies and gentlemen,
your winner, Kurt Sloane!

Hey everybody, we're here with
the winner, Kurt Sloane.

Man, hell of a fight.

I want to know, what do you
call that finishing move?

That was like the hurricane arm bar that's
what they call it, the hurricane arm bar.

Hurricane arm bar.
I like it, I like it.

Congrats again.

When I went down...
I must have blacked out.

Don't ever scare me like that again.

I had this dream.
It's really strange.

Promise you'll never leave me.

I promise.

Got a limo waiting for us out front...

with full bar.

Let me grab a shower and
I'll meet you there.

Okay.

Kurt Sloane?
US Marshall services.

What can I do for you?

I don't know. Um... you could
come along quietly, I guess.

What for?

Apparently, tough guy,
you killed someone.

This is for Eric.

Maybe you forgot.

About 18 months
ago over in Thailand? No?

That was self-defense.

Ah. Well, that's good.

That's the kind of stuff that you want
to tell the judge once you get there.

We were just told about
getting you there.

Can I see that badge again?

Sure.

Welcome back.

Shock and aw!
Just like you feeling now!

The man who killed Tong Po.

The odds for an American
beach boy were astronomical.

You will be joining with
him in hell shortly

Maybe.

What I need it was for
you to take his place

As the next big attraction.
That would have been...

but you left Thailand.

Today is when you find out...
It doesn't work that way, does it?

It is time for you to defend your title.

In another fight to the death.
Don't you think?

Never again.

You are not smart enough to let me go.

You touch me again,
and I will break your nose.

The sense of humor.

Stop!

This guy.

One more fight to death.

Against the current champion.

That's all I am asking! "Voila"!

Step in to the ring with Mongkut.

I will pay you 1 million American dollars.

Tax-free.

Or you spend the rest
of your life in prison.

Without the possibility
of ever getting out.

Just remember, the man in this
prison loved Tong Po.

They know who you are.
Surprises and fears.

They are making a move on you.

I got this.

You better call the prison doctor.

Tell him there is three
broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Dislocated jaw and a broken nose.

That was not too good, was it?

One day in the general population
and already in some sort of trouble.

You are not going to make it, Mr Sloane.
At least not like this.

Behind these walls,
you will have fight to the death everyday.

So why not just take the money?

When you'll agree to fight for me,

You will instantly call from
choking on your own vomit.

To comfort well, and provocative
sensual amusement.

Kurt.

Are you in there?
You with me on this?

When you were kid,
did you get your ass kicked much?

You look so much better with
that nose I give you.

I do love your spirit.
I hate to waste it.

Can you believe she actually
sent me this picture?

Wow, that's crazy!

Hello?
Honey, it's me.

Kurt. Where... where are you?
What happened?

I've been going crazy here.
I've been kidnapped.

I am outside of Bangkok in a prison.

Kidnapped? Kurt!
Where are you?

You interrupted my meditation.

Meditation, really?
Does that help you to stay calm?

I'm calm. Very calm.

I guess not.

I keep my fist fast and hard.

Ready to break anything that it hits.

What is important that could not
be said at the police station.

I do not feel safe
at the police station.

What could possibly be safer than that?

I need your help.

A few years ago, when you were a cop
you investigated us.

And now you want our help?

Tell me where my husband is.
Here's the payment.

He is being held at the
northern jail facility

for the murder of Tong Po.

Who is responsible for this?
Thomas Tang more, a fight promoter.

You did not hear that from me.

Get him released.

You do not have that much money.

Follow her.
Tell me where she goes.

That's the way they have implemented
the attitude adjustment.

I want what you got.
You took the lash without a whimper.

Over here.

Every day I want you to come
down here and grab this plant.

Deaden the nerves.

Put it on your back at night.

The rest will have to do with your mind.

Can you walk?
Maybe.

C'mon. Behind the wall.

You will never fight the same way again.
Trust me.

Durand.

Kurt.

What are you doing here?

Training fighters.

Here? Why?

Because I was accused to participate
in the murder of Tong Po.

Can you believe that?

And also I wont give you up.

So Mr. Moore blind me.

Don't get sentimental.
It is a blessing.

How is any of this a blessing?

Being able to use my sense
without the eyes...

It's a blessing. Being able to know the
answer before the question.

It's a blessing..

Don't look in my eyes.

You are not alone.

After 2 weeks we have made
absolutely no progress.

Yeah, we have to find a way to act this up.

And see our adamant and condition to fight

We can all, dismay him later...

Once we get bored with this.

Are you ready to listen to me now?

I know this guy.
I know how to break him.

Hey. You rang?

Thanks for coming.

Are you kidding?

So what have you been doing?

Working for a private investigator,

looking for deadbeat dads.

I'm looking for my husband.

I think he's in the northern jail.

I also need you to get to the kidnapper.

This guy's name is
Thomas Tang Moore.

I know he's got more
money than God.

Well, it's not about the ransom money.

Let me keep over some stats.

I'll meet you back here in two hours.

Okay. thanks.

Don't worry.
We'll find him!

My man Kurt Sloane.

I still owe you two broken ribs.

I may have deserved that.
But I am just here to talk to you.

The answer is still no.

Is it now?

In that case, I have something
you might want to see.

If you touch her...

I am not the one you have to worry about.

You know what he wants.

Now... are you willing
to talk to Mr Moore?

Did you just say yes?

Yeah.

What else they can do to you?

They got my wife.

I am so excited about the fight.

This is a fight
I will pay to see.

Well, obviously.

I have my conditions.

You may not have any contact
with her or anyone else...

until the fight.

But we can show you
she's very well cared for.

If anybody hurts her...

We die! We all die!
You die!

Not you. You...

You have to feel yourself.

The air moves.

Before it moves.

Because...

You are him.

Use his force as yours.

Anticipation.

Hidden anticipation.

No, put your weight behind.

That, come on.

You gotta get past him first.

Have faith in your ability.

Tell me when you start to feel
it coming close to you.

Now.

Take off the blind fold.

Too late to do anything.

Well that didn't work.

How is your training going?

He's getting it.

Oh, yeah? Maybe he'll
never get it, you know?

Oh, he got it in him.

Listen, Briggs.
I know his skills.

And he may never be that good.

He will beat Mongkut.
Guaranteed.

You mention Mongkut one more time,

then I'll smash your big face.

Oh really?

Do you see what I mean?

He is blind as a bat.

No more jail!

You will train in the comfort
of my luxurious suburb compound.

So just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I need my trainer, Durand.

And I still need to train
with my prison crew.

I am here to help.
Done!

I'll need a field trip
for and exhibition fight

when I am ready.

I love this guy.

You have to start the training.

Start?
Start.

Start the focus.
And to forget everything else.

It's kind of hard.

They kidnapped your wife.

You have to fight big monster.

Let's laugh about it.
Ha ha.

Let's go back to the
business and get focused.

Your strength against its weakness.

It's your speed and your flexibility.
Dexterity.

What's his weakness?

That's a good question, Kurt.

I would like to see Mongkut training.

How do you see anything?
You are blind.

Well, then you have nothing to worry about.
I just want to see him..

Meet Mongkut.

State of the art miracle of
bioengineering killing machine

A fighter bred from generation of fighters.

With the top modern chemistry.

By the sound of his breathing, he sound
like a rhinoceros. Right?

His handler graduated
Cambridge top of his class.

Went right to work for Mr Moore
for mil a year.

What is he doing?

An adrenaline cocktail.

This is not the way.
You know this.

There is no drug testing for
illegal underground fights right?

This is not the martial art.
It's not the truth.

Mongkut is a superior
human specimen.

Greater faster.

Stronger than any human being
on the planet.

Everything okay with your champion?

Oh, yeah. He is fine.

Oh yeah.

Let Kurt live.

I beg you.

What about this?
I fight Mongkut instead of Kurt.

Well, it will be exciting, no?

That would be exciting.

You got quite a follow on.

This is true.

One problem. You are blind.

Maybe blind..

With the sensation I can see
ugliest man in the world.

The strongest man in the world.

Yes, of course, forgive me.

But to see blind men fighting...
will make a fortune. No?

That is a really exciting prospect.

But of course, I don't
really need the money.

Cancel this fight.

You really thought you could
appeal to my better nature...?

Good bye.

You have to learn how to fly.

The strongest man
does not always win.

But the smartest one does.

Not bad.

Thanks.

I am a friend of Liu's
What?

She told me you're here.

And they took her.
I am here to help you.

Okay. Higher than that.

High. Kick high.

Higher than that.
He's 6 feet 10. C'mon.

Higher. Again.

He will kill you in a second.

Death has its benefits.

You will save a lots of expenses.

I killed Tong Po!
Mongkut is four times Tong Po, Kurt.

You will lose.

There might be another way.

All I need is the third guy
to cause the disturbance.

Well done.

Hey. You smoke?
Yeah, sure.

We just caught a break.

New guard over there.
He knows where she is.

The dragon on his arm
it's in the video.

We got to go now.

Do this thing tonight while
he's on duty.

Time for that field trip.

I have to clear with Mr Moore.

I get on that.

The money.

Master Durand! It's always good
to see you again, my friend.

King.

I know you.
Kurt Sloane, isn't it?

Yeah, I remember you from the awful
shackling you took last time you were here.

That's right.

Yeah, I trust you never try that again huh?

You know, Joseph King by name...

Joe king by nature.

Ah, you've heard that before.

So, word on the street has it
that you're fighting Mongkut.

Have you always been suicidal?

Do me a favor. Can he
fight your fighter?

So you are back to get your ass kicked huh?

Well, I will have to see
your money first friend.

Money.

Thank you.

Holy molly, look at that!
Easy money just walked in the door!

Again, come with me.

Hold on.

Remember, we are
not here for that.

Yeah.

Be careful.
I got this.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we
have a brand new challenger.

Well, technically
he's an old challenger

with suicidal tendencies.

Let's welcome this misguided
unfortunate soul.

Kurt Sloane, ladies and gentlemen.

A brave young warrior.

Willing to risk it all, to last
just 2 minutes in the ring.

With the one and only soul survivor.

The beast. The Widow maker.

The bringer of pain, Moss.

I hate violence.
I need to go to the bathroom.

I need your phone.

I need the phone.

Travis.
"Daddy, is that you?"

Wait, the fight's over.

Kurt wins.
Nice bloody skill.

You come here once and make
an utter fool of yourself

and then come back to mop the floor
with my best fighter? Come here.

My take.

The next time we
should to be partners.

Maybe next time.

I guess all the training paid off.

Where the fuck is that bullshit?

Move, move, move!
Move, move, move!

Long time pops.

He's my son, Travis.
Time to go.

Go save your wife.
Trust me. I will take care of them.

Come on, let's go.
Go, go.

Where the hell are we going?

That's up to you.
You know where she is.

I know where Liu is.

You are standing right next to
in the video. Where is she?

What is this about?

All right, listen.
Let's go to the river.

North Row!

Aye aye.

What?

So... how many guys
hiding behind this cars?

I am telling you, this is it.

No more bullshit.

Let me go, I will show you.

You're gonna need me to get in anyway.

You might wanna start being
a little more specific.

Where are we going?
Penthouse, top floor.

<i>ACCESS GRANTED</i>

You are gonna regret this one.
I'm telling you this man.

Go.

Put your gun down.
Drop your knife.

You okay?
Yes, I'm okay.

Are you sure? You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

She can shoot.

Let's go.

Put him down.

Do you know, you should not be here?

No!

Honey, wake up! Honey!

Honey, wake up.
Wake up.

Call an ambulance!

Call an ambulance! Right now!

Wake up, wake up.
Please, wake up.

You will tell Moore I will fight that
son of a bitch anytime anywhere.

They told me that...
if she comes out of that coma...

What is this if?
Don't even think about it.

I don't believe in church...

but I pray like a fool
for you to come back.

He loves the you. He needs you.

Kurt?

God.

You scared me.

Now you know how I feel.

I am gonna fight him.

I know.

So what's his weakness?

A glass jaw.

When you have his heart racing,
you make your move.

But the timing has to be perfect.

So what's the move.

The kill-shot, right to the jaw.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to the original
muay Thai temple.

It all started here, over
two thousand years ago.

The villagers sent their
children here to study.

And the teachers were masters
of martial arts.

And all the spirits of
all the Muay Thai fighters...

...were taught here,
and fought here.

And found their mastery here.

Their spirits are here with us tonight!

Ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to bring out the man...

who bought us the biggest upset ever.

And I was so amazed
in the fighter's ability.

To withstand the punishment...
and waited for his moment.

Some say it must be luck.

Kurt Sloane!

But today we will find out
if that luck holds.

Because here tonight,
to avenge the mighty Tong Po...

weighing at 400 pounds...

He has killed over 20
opponents in the ring.

Let's here for the man of the hour..

The biggest man of any hour...

One and only... Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!

An application was downloaded
on your cellphone.

You can not bet
during fight hours.

At the end of each round,
you can place another bet.

But you cannot change
the original bets. Clear?

Ladies and gentlemen...

Pick your bet.

You've been well trained.
Don't forget...

flexibility, dexterity
and momentum.

And remember...
the kill-shots.

Fighters!

I am so happy to hear that your wife
came out of the coma.

I just want you to know
that after I kill you...

I will keep that sweet ass warm at night.

To your corner.

Round one.

Shit.

No.

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Kurt! You have to
feel the air move...

before it moves.

That's right.

Kurt! Conquer it!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Stop.
C'mon, Dad.

Let's hear Kurt Sloane!

Cause he may not be here with us
but stronger.

C'mon, wake up.

Kurt! Kurt!

This is a really bad idea.

I know.

I don't stand a chance.

Are you gonna make this quick?

I have an idea.
Don't let him hit you...

touch you.
Stay away from him. Okay?

Yeah, good tip, Dad.

Moore wants us to finish this up.

He's really big.

I know.

Get out there and get this guy down.
Let's finish this.

Cause it is our advance rounds,

with the blades to the elbow...
to the knees.

Round 2.

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

Yeah!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

He's dead.

Kurt! Kurt!

Kurt! C'mon. Please!

Said you wouldn't leave me. Kurt!

Kurt!

We have a winner!

The greatest warrior in the world!

Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

Bravo!

I would like to see his face again.

Take me away from here.

Holy shit!

Oh, my God!

To the greatest fighter in the world!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!

Time for the third round.

No. This is over.

Do I look dead to you?

The only way I am going down
is if you ugly me to death.

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

C'mon.

Take it easy.

Do something!

Fighters! To your corners.

Ladies and Gentlemen.
Do not cash in any payment.

This fight is not over!

Double or nothing!

At this moment, make your bets.
Double or nothing.

The blindfold.

Okay.

And now for the third round.
Back from the dead...

Kurt Sloane wants more punishment.

Say again.

Go. Kill him.

Let's fight!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!

You have to feel its thoughts...

The air moves...

before he moves.
Anticipation.

The strongest man does not always win.
But the smartest one does.

Come on!

Kurt! Run the big man to the ground.

C'mon!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Mongkut! Mongkut!
Mongkut! Mongkut!

Your brother is brave.
Your brother was a warrior.

Unlike you.
Such a coward.

If you keep coming up with the
drive to desire and will to win

I will make you immortal.

This is your destiny.
Believe in yourself.

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior! White warrior!

The kill-shot!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

White warrior! White warrior!
White warrior!

Shock and aw!

Attention! Attention!

Kurt Sloane just defeated Mongkut!
Incredible!

Durand. He is not that big.

Okay. Alright.
Lift your hand, champion.
