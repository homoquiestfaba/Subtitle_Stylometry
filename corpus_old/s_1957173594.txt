Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

There can't be
two alpha Titans.

The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

stems from Iwi mythology.

He's gotten too big over time.

This environment
won't sustain much longer.

It's too unstable.

Hey.

[in sign language]

[in sign language]


Off-site would be
a death sentence.

You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

There has to be another way.

<i>Welcome to</i> TTP,
Titan Truth Podcast.

<i>Episode number 245.</i>

<i>Today is the day.</i>

<i>Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.</i>

<i>And look, I know
I said that last week</i>

<i>and maybe the week before
and a few other times.</i>

<i>But, look, this is the point.</i>

After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics,

I'm finally taking my shot.

Something bad
is going on here.

I don't know what it is,

but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

Yeah, you can call me
a whistleblower,

but I ain't just whistling.

I mean, this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

And believe me, this flood

is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

You can believe that.

[automated voice on speaker]
<i>Welcome to Apex Cybernetics.</i>

<i>No unauthorized persons
allowed beyond this point.</i>

[man on TV] <i>When we started
Apex Cybernetics,</i>

<i>we dreamt of new ways</i>

<i>to push past the limits
of human potential.</i>

<i>Robotics, the human mind,
artificial intelligence.</i>

<i>Who knows what brave new
future we'll dream of next?</i>

<i>I'm Walter Simmons,</i>

<i>and it is my privilege
to lead Apex</i>

<i>into humanity's bold new era.</i>

<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>And neither are you.</i>


[indistinct chatter on radio]

No, don't eat that!

It's incredibly unhealthy.

It's just all the GMOs.

Growing a second head
could be useful.

You have to let me know.

Because me, myself?

I can barely handle
the one I got. [chuckles]

Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

I mean, really doing here.

Why are you here?

This isn't Engineering.

Because, you know,
I had to wait

because they're rendering
these new specs,

which is gonna
take over, uh...

That's calculator mode.

...over one hour,
maybe even more.

So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

and make some new friends.
Oh.

Oh! Now that
we're new friends,

I can share something
with you, right?

I know it's in here somewhere.

This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

It's really amazing.

Don't know
if I used that or not.


Yes. This. Check this out.

That right there
is radio mesh networking

with a voice-record
subprocessor.

Guess from where. Come on.
I don't care.

A toaster! [chuckles]

It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

I have to go to the bathroom.

Is it one or two?

'Cause if it's two, it's
probably from these apples.

Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

I'm good.

Okay, I'll just stay here.


Ah, let's see.

Whoo.

Screen.

What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

What's Sublevel 33?

What the...?

[indistinct shouting]


Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line.

Let's go!

cyanide capsules

instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

so don't listen to me.

this way! Let's go, let's go!

Yeah, that way.

It's time!

We need to go now!

[indistinct shouting]

[people screaming]

[automated voice] <i>Evacuate.</i>

One level at a time, okay.

No.
Hey, you!

Where's your clearance tag?
You know what?

The fact that
you're talking about

clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

is incredibly unprofessional.

We should be talking
about evacuation.

Yo! Okay!

<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

Navy's Fourth Fleet</i>

<i>is deployed off
the southeastern seaboard</i>

<i>of the U.S. after last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.</i>

<i>A time of
relative peace shattered</i>

<i>when the massive Titan,</i>

<i>once thought to be
a hero to humanity,</i>

<i>made landfall
in Pensacola, Florida.</i>

<i>While the damage
was largely contained</i>

<i>to the U.S. headquarters
of Apex Cybernetics,</i>

<i>governments around the world
aren't taking any chances</i>

<i>after the first substantiated
Titan sighting</i>

<i>in over three years.</i>

<i>CEO Walter Simmons
had this to say.</i>

<i>It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.</i>

<i>Godzilla's a threat
to humanity,</i>

<i>and Apex has a plan
to deal with it,</i>

<i>once and for all.</i>
[school bell rings]

[woman on PA] <i>Students and

[Bernie on speaker]
<i>Welcome back, loyal listeners,</i>

<i>to</i> Titan Truth Podcast,
<i>episode 246.</i>

<i>Oh, my God. I was there.</i>

<i>Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!</i>

<i>You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears</i>

<i>and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?</i>

<i>Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.</i>

you, there's something

provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

if there wasn't
another Titan around?

That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

You should be in school.
I am just trying to help.

I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

I don't have any more.

And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

How could you doubt him?

There has to be a pattern.
There doesn't.

A reason why he was provoked.
There isn't.

How do you know that?

Because creatures,
like people, can change.

And right now,
Godzilla's out there

and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

See you at home, Dad.

my theory?</i>

<i>I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.</i>

<i>Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.</i>

<i>Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back</i>

<i>to sixth grade with this,
okay?</i>

<i>Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.</i>

<i>Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub</i>

<i>with an advanced robotics lab.</i>

<i>That's the variable.</i>

<i>And add them up
and your answer is</i>

<i>that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.</i>

[faint beep]
[door closes]

Can I help you?

If you want an appointment,

my office hours
are nine to five.

[Walter] Please, Dr. Lind.
What the f...

Guys like you and me,

we don't do normal hours,
do we?

I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

for as long as you have.

Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

is fascinating.

Your book was very impressive.

Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

in my apartment
if you want some.


Walt Simmons.

I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

Allow me to introduce

our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

He has an interesting thing
to show you.


Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

You know what this is, right?


as vast as any ocean,

right beneath our feet.

This energy signal
is enormous.

And almost identical
to readings from <i>Gojira.</i>

fuels the planet's surface,

this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

If we can harness
this life force,

we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

I need your help to find it.


I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

Did you read the reviews?

"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

Look where they put my office.

I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

We tried.

I'm sorry about your brother.

He was a true pioneer.

Thanks.

[sniffles, clears throat]

See, all of our forward scans

suggest a habitable
environment down there.

So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

When they tried to enter,

they hit
a gravitational inversion.

A whole planet's worth
of gravity

reversed in a split second.

They were crushed
in an instant.

What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

have created
a phenomenal craft

which could sustain
such an inversion?

The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

HEAV.

We can make the journey

to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

But we need you
to lead the mission.

Help me.

Help everyone.

Finding this needle
in a haystack

is our best shot
against Godzilla.

Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

But it's crazy.

I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

with genetic memory?

It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

to return
to their evolutionary source.

Like spawning salmon.

Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

So if this is the Titans' home

and this life force
sustains them...

A Titan
could show you the way.


With a little help
of an old colleague.

[thunder rumbles]

in Hollow Earth?

This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

need Kong to bring us to it!

Kong out of containment,

Godzilla's gonna come for him.

keep him here forever.

No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

on Kong's habitat.

No way am I
letting you drag him

halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

As an ally.

To protect us,
lead the way down there.

What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

You always believed
that Skull Island

was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

Mm-hmm.

Through the entrance
in Antarctica,

we could help him
find a new home.

And he could save ours.

Hers.

That power source
may be our only hope.

We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

We have to take it.

[creatures chittering]

[electrical crackling
and humming]


Okay.
Yes!

But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

You name the terms. Thank you.

Sorry. Thank you.

You won't regret this.

Mm, I already regret this.

Well, he can smell you, too.

What's she saying?

Just an Iwi expression.

It means
that you're very brave.

Yeah?
[Ilene] Mm-hmm.

on the sedatives.

He's our escort.

We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

What do you do then?
[PA chimes]

[woman on PA]
<i>Dr. Lind, please report</i>

<i>to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.</i>

Excuse me.

New arrivals.

[in sign language]

[metal creaks]
[Kong grunting]

[growls softly]

Welcome.

Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

Ha-ha.
I'm Maia Simmons.

My father sent me.

I run point for Apex.

Nathan Lind, mission chief.

[Kong growls]

Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

[Kong growls]
[metal clangs]

The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

but these prototypes
we're loaning you

will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

I love Miatas.

Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

The antigravity engines
alone produce

enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

Feel free to be impressed.

Wow.

[thunder crashes]



at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

Now, the gravitational
inversion

will be quite intense.

Our best guess
is that on entry,

it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

HEAVs.

If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

I believe we can do this.


You just gotta do yours.

Excellent.


We've avoided all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

according to your guidelines.

Good.

Do I need to be concerned?

Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

The myths say
that their ancestors

fought each other
in a great war.

So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?


No, I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

I know this for sure.

Kong bows to no one.

[faint, muffled moaning]

To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

I don't think he could tell.

No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

My mission, my wheel.

I just don't think
it's a good idea,

looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

And he's the only one
looking for the truth

about Godzilla and Apex.

So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?


If we don't, nobody else will.

Are you coming or not?

Obviously I'm coming.

[turns off stereo]
That's how we find him.

The bleach.
Bleach?

He consumes a ton of bleach.

He drinks bleach?

Showers with it.

Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

See? Tradecraft.

Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

just one more place.

Madison, this is getting old.

Hey, you sell bleach?

Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

Look, we're looking for a guy

who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

He's probably paranoid,

high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

if he has a beard.

Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

Because I can help you
with candy.

Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

Yeah, we want lots of candy.

What are you doing?
You think...?

Oh, you mean Bernie.

Yeah, I know that guy.

He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

I know where he is, too.

If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

[banging on door]


[clears throat] Mis...

[thud]
[Bernie groans]

[in deep voice]
Mister Bernie not home.

Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

Yeah. Um...

Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.


I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.


[Bernie chuckles] No. No.

Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

My name is Madison Russell.

My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

Emma Russell, right?

<i>Before we go any farther,
I got one question.</i>

Tap or no tap?

No tap.

Excuse me, what is "tap"?
Water.

They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

Oh, I drink tap water.

Yeah, I kind of figured that.

But she does the thinking
for both of you,

so it should be all right.

Thanks.
Okay.

What you got?

I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

haven't just been random.

I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

I'm of the same opinion.

But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

trying to figure out
what their game was.

Then, last week...

I saw this.

A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

which makes no sense

because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

Then what?
And then boom!

Godzilla shows up.

Caved in half the facility,

but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

Yeah, but what is that?

That's, um...

That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

It was a gift from my Sara.

You have a Sara?

She was my wife.

Um, she passed on.

[Bernie sighs]

She was my rock.

My truth.

I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

that's the day
you know I've given up.


I think we can
help each other.

Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

We're breaking into Apex.

[Josh] Wait, what?
[Bernie] You heard her.

Tap water.

Shit.


[grunts contentedly]


[in sign language]

Thank you.

How is she?

Calm. So calm, it's scary.

That was extraordinary.

I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

No.

I knew that they had a bond.

He trusts her.

Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

When the storm
took over the island,

it wiped out
the native people.

But Kong saved her.

She had nowhere to go.

So I made a promise,

then and there,
to protect her.

And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

Do you think he would take
directions from her?

No.

If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

And she's a child.

[distant, muffled pulsing]

[muffled groaning]

Jia is only a child.

But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

<i>And we need Kong
to find that power source.</i>

The world needs him.

[alarm blaring]

[muffled moaning]

[indistinct shouting]

What's she saying?

Godzilla.


[urgent chatter]

[Kong grunts]
[metal clangs]

Did we change course?

No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.


Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

How about we throw you off
instead, huh?


We have to release him.

If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

He's a sitting duck out there.

We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

Nathan?



[both snarling]

This won't end
until one of them submits.

[groaning softly]

[Nathan] Shut it down.
What?

All of it.

Guns, engines.

Shut it down. Right now.
If we do that, we're dead.

No, we're playing dead.

And we're making him think
that he's won.

[mic whines]

Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

<i>Kill anything
that makes a noise.</i>

[power shutting down]

[silence descends]

This better work.

[in sign language]

[moans weakly]

he'll be back.

How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

How's Kong with heights?

So, what's the plan?

what's on Sublevel 33.

[bottle clinks]
[Josh] Ow.

Keep it moving, tap water.

Go ahead.


All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

Okay. We got this.

Oh, my God!

we can trust this guy?

Yeah, why?

Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

and carries
a bottle of whiskey

from his dead wife like a gun.

I think it's romantic.

Whoo-hoo!

I really don't
understand women.


Okay, come on.

No, it was here.

I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

You believe me, right?

'Cause I know that

Hell. Goes to hell.

What is all this?

It's breakaway civilization.

I mean, come on.
This is page one

in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

in case any
of these governments

and megacorporations

accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

It makes sense

if you think about it.
Yeah, sure.

[indistinct shouting]

[Madison] Someone's coming.
What?

Someone's coming.
What?

[Josh] Someone's coming?
[Madison] Yes!

Oh, my God.

[muffled squelching]

[Josh] They look like eggs.
Skull-crawlers.

What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

let's load it up!

[screams]
[alarm blares]

What was that?

[engine humming]
No way. No, no, no. Come on.

Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

It says we're headed

to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

What?
[Bernie] Hong Kong.

That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

What if she tells him

there are others
down there like him?

But you don't know that.

We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

There's no way back for him.

And he can't survive here.

[growls softly]


All right. All right.

He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

We gotta go.

Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

It'll be the most amazing

[Madison] Oh, my God!

It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

So, what is this place?

Well, if there's a corporate-friendly

I'd say we are in it.

Yeah, it could be

He's in a trance.

That's a psionic uplink.

It follows his will.

Oh, Apex, what have you done?

You can't just drill into it.


My father gets what he wants.

That's Apex property now.

We should be able

That is the discovery

You can't strip it for parts.
Hold it.

Go. Go. Got what we needed.

Let's go!



Mr. Serizawa,
start your engines!

The upgrade is untested.

Once we get online,

<i>Gojira</i> will come
straight for us.

He's been coming for us

since our creation
first awoke.

We must embrace it.
We shouldn't rush this.

We have no idea
how this energy source

will affect the Mecha.

Get in the goddamn chair.

I'm just saying Greenpeace

Where do I know you from?

Oh, my goodness.

yes?

You caused all of this.

If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

have given humanity a chance

then, yes,
I will own that title.

Godzilla had left us in peace.

You provoked him into war.
