I've made
a lot of mistakes in my life...

choices I can never change.

We grew up having
to be soldiers around here.

Most don't make it
past the age of 24.

But I never thought
it would come to this.

So, Bobby,
you gonna call Gina?

I don't know, bro.
She seem to be tripping.

Yeah, I heard she had fleas and shit.

No wonder my balls have been itching.

And that's not the worst.
You want to talk about the worst?

The best part of you
ran down your mother's leg.

Oh.
Nah, bro, she ain't got no fleas.

¿Más Cafecito?

It's from your dirty-ass house.

But seriously though, dawg,

does your mom like having
a dirty-ass house?

Hold up,
we're the only ones here, right?

Shut up, bitch.
You ain't gonna do shit.

Don't fuck around, Jason.

What are you thinking, bro?

Well, I was thinking that, uh,

Bobby and Derek go watch
the door and take a lookout

while me and Julian
go get the cash.

Whoa, fuck that, dude. We come here
all the time. They know who we are.

You're such a pussy, bro.
Yo, be cool, man.

I'll do it.

All right,
me and Derek will do it.

You two just go watch the door.

Little bitches.

That is so fucking stupid.

Hey, yo, hurry the fuck up!

We're so fucking busted.
Hey, man!

Shut the fuck up, stop being
a little bitch and watch the door!

Hurry up.

Shit. Get the money.

What are you do...

Shit.
What the fuck, Jason?

Get the money.

Let's go. Come on, go.

That is so fucking stupid!

You know what?
You said it yourself, bitch--

they know us,
and I ain't about to go to jail.

Well, you should have sat there
and ate your fucking torta, asshole.

Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

After that night,

things were never the same.

It seemed as though Julian and I

were the only ones who grew up.

Jason and Derek just got worse.

Whoo!
Bobby!

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Or at least Jason did.

Derek was just a little tagalong.

He did whatever Jason told him.

Hey, say hi to your mom for me.

These high school graduates.

So how does it feel, mijo?

I don't know.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.

What, that you'll be attending

West Virginia University
in the fall, or what?

No, that you're gonna blow
your entire life savings

on sending us both to college.

Each class gotta be about what,
like, 100 satellite dishes?

Órale, I don't want you guys
to think about that, okay?

That's mine.
That's what I have to worry about.

¿'ta bueno?

I know this is
a special day for you guys,

but I need you
to remember one thing:

One day does not define a man.

¿Entiendes?

Yeah.
Thanks, Pop.

Bobby, let me get a picture
of you guys real quick.

Yeah.

Orale.

Smile. Perfect.

My high school graduates.

Hey, I'm gonna go
talk to these guys.

Okay.
Good seeing you.

Mucho cuidado.

Derek, we got us
some college boys in our crew now.

Julian, you know
you're my hero now, right?

Oh-ho-ho, well
let me save you, Derek.

What, you're all badass
now or what?

Give me a fucking hug, asshole.

Hey, man, watch your mouth
in front of my pops, all right?

I'm sorry, señor.
I'm just really proud of su hijo.

Tell 'em about the party, fool.
Go ahead, tell 'em.

We're throwing you vatos
a party at this fool's pad.

Oh, shit.
So when can we expect you?

Y'all better come, eh?
We got cakes, trash can punch y todo.

Well, hell, I'm in.
I'll be there.

Yeah? You in?
Yeah.

All right.
How about you, Julian? You in?

Or are you a little pussy
like you always are?

At least I got a house, fool.

This one gets a piece of paper
and grows some balls.

Let me show it to you,
motherfucker.

Hey, put that shit away,
for real, for real.

We're proud of you guys,
real fucking proud.

Bring some bitches
to the party tonight, all right?

And not just him.

Tell your moms I'll pick her up
at 8:00, yeah? Cool?

That's not funny, dawg.

Ahí voy.

Hi.

I'm so proud of you.

Thanks, Mrs. Fernandez.
It wasn't easy.

I don't know.
She's your daughter.

I'm gonna miss you, Mrs. Fernandez.

Where's Gina?

¡Ay, Chingada!

Hey.

Hi.

Oh, Bobby.

Baby.

I'm so sorry I couldn't make it

to your graduation.

It's okay.
Yeah?

Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

There's nothing left to say

I wanna take it for what it's for

And, baby, bring it...

I love you so much.

I'ma have your life...

So are you gonna be okay?

Yeah.

I don't need no man.

Look at you.

You think you're all bad now.

I can see it in your eyes.

Nah.

How long are
you gonna be gone for?

Four, maybe five years.

But you can come visit me
any time you want.

Yeah.

I can't afford that.

Well, I could send you some money.

Or better yet,
I could send you some plane tickets.

Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

Gina.

Gina, look at me.

What?
Hey.

Hey, look at me.

It's okay.

Would you promise me one thing?

Yeah.

What?

You'll wait for me?

Yeah.

I'll wait for you.

The gloves is off,
the sword is sharp

I swear to God, this time
I am leaving a mark

And I dare a motherfucker
to say something about Bugsy

They find ya bitch-ass in Kentucky

Nothing will get in my way

I'm willing to pay
however much it cost...

Bobby, you made it.

I thought I told you to bring
some fucking bitches, man, come on.

This is the only chick I travel with.

Aww, don't do that shit
in front of me, come on.

Besides, don't you have Derek?
Aww, fuck you.

What's up, bitches?

Is that the only chick you brought?

Duh.
It's the only chick I need.

You whooped-ass motherfucker.
You're fucked up,

Get your-- come on,
get out of here, fool. Stupid ass.

Hey, thanks for coming, man.

Have a drink,
smoke some weed,

do whatever you want
with your girl.

I'm gonna get that girl over there.

She's been eye-fucking me
all night, man. Fuck.

Have fun, all right?
All right, thank you, man. Thank you.

You will refer to me as King,
and I run SA...

How are y'all doing?
I'm Julian.

Can I get you ladies a beer? Yeah?

Hey, move, pussy.

Really, dude? What the fuck
is your problem, bro?

What the fuck?
You ain't gonna do shit.

I ain't gonna do shit?

What, you gonna do something?
Do something, bitch.

Go. Go.
Do something.

Punk-ass bitch,
that's what I thought.

What the fuck, bitch?
Oh, what?

Hey, hey!
Who's the pussy now? Do it.

Come on, do it.
Do your boy, bro.

Come on, put one in my fucking dome.
What the fuck?

What the hell?
I'm tired of this fucking pendejo

always running in my shit.

What the fuck?
What?

What?

He grabbed my dick, bro.

I wouldn't touch your pito chiquito

with a fucking ten-foot pole, bro.

He fucking grabbed your dick?
That's why you pull out the fucking gun?

Come on, man,
you're fucking up the party.

I gotta keep this motherfucker
in check every once in a while, bro.

Hey, put the gun away, man.

Man, I overreacted.
I overreacted.

Hey, go back to partying, man.
What the fuck?

Shut the fuck up, man.

Hey, hey, nothing can come
between us, right?

Especially with all the shit
we've fucking been through.

Come on, stupid.

My bad.

Get a fucking drink.

"Overreacted" is a big
fucking word for you, Mexican.

Pulling out a fucking gun.

Come on, bro, let's get
some fucking pizza, some pizza.

Oh, pito chiquito.

Do you want a beer?

Yes.

It's foamy.

Very foamy.
That's yours.

Love you, Pop.
I love you, too.

Phone home, cabrón.
I will.

Mucho cuidado.

Julian.

I want to tell you, mijo,

that I'm very, very proud of you.

And I'm pretty sure

your parents would be
proud of you too, mijo.

No, no, en serio.

And no matter what anybody says...

you're my son.

¿'ta bueno?

Stop it.
Stop it.

Stop it with that
teary-eyed shit, eh?

You're supposed to be
happy right now.

Cuídate, okay?

My father took Julian in
when he was 10.

His parents were in and out
of rehab for most of his life.

Sometimes the place you're from
and the people you love

are the only things
holding you down.

We can never erase what happened,

but when you get the opportunity

to do something right,

you take it.

Robert Ramirez, Julian Medina,

pack up your stuff
and come with me.

Bobby, what do you think
this is about, man?

I don't know, man.

I mean,
we didn't do anything, right?

Relax. Here they come.

Gentlemen, Agent Montelongo.

Afternoon. Have a seat.

We don't have a lot of time,
so were gonna get right into this.

You know this guy?

What about this guy?

That's Jason.
We all grew up together.

How do they feel about you two
graduating from the academy?

How would they know?

Childhood friends and all,
you'd think--

No, this is something
Julian and I decided to do.

We kept it from everyone
but our father.

I mean, not because we're ashamed

but just 'cause we didn't think
they would understand.

Good.
That's all I needed to know.

Jason and Derek are connected
to a man that goes by Nadie.

He's on our Most Wanted list
and I want his ass.

You two are being assigned
to get Nadie,

immediately following
tomorrow's graduation ceremony.

Congratulations.

Robert, you're gonna do
some time in jail--

just a little actual time.

The rest will be added
to the system.

A couple of B&Es,
minor offenses--

nothing crazy.
You'll get all the details.

Julian,

you're the smartest kid
at the academy.

We want your help running
this thing from a distance.

No one knows
these two better than you two.

We're very lucky
to have you on our team.

I've set up a meeting
with the captain of the SAPD.

We'll brief you more then.

Good luck, gentlemen.

This is the shit
you came to the academy for.

I found out Pops was sick
when we graduated.

The only contact we'd had
with him was over the phone.

He never said anything.

And he didn't start to sound bad

until the cancer finally
took total control of his lungs.

It was hard to see him like that.

But my father would
rather have died

than missed seeing his
little homeboys

graduate from the
FBI Academy.

It was a sad day when
my father died.

He was all I had for most
of my life.

You be strong, mijo.

Don't ever let me

or your father down, okay?

You do as he says.

He loves you

more than anything in this world.

Acércate.

And after my mother died,

Pops made me strong

and helped me to understand
that there's a plan for all of us.

My father's death
was especially hard on Julian.

He was the only true father
he ever knew.

Julian was only 13
when they overdosed.

He refused to go to their funeral.

After we buried my father,

Julian was the only family
I had left.

Agent Ramirez, Medina,
pleasure to meet you.

I heard nothing but good things.
Cap.

You guys ready to work?

Good, 'cause I'm gonna need you

to get closer to Jason
than we originally anticipated.

This thing's a little bigger
than we actually thought.

How much bigger?

Nadie pretty much owns Texas.

He's got connections
in and out of the US.

This guy's set up shop
in just about every major city.

He's got a legion of followers
as young as goddamn 10-years-old.

If the Bureau knows so much,
why can't you bring him down?

As it stands right now,
we can't directly link him to anything.

Legally speaking,
this guy's untouchable.

Why is SAPD involved?
We have reason to believe

that one of our finest
might be on the payroll.

And not a lot of badges
know about this at all

'cause there's not
many people we can trust.

Seems like Nadie only trusts Jason
and Derek and people that he brings in.

That's where you come in.
You understand?

I don't see how anyone
could trust those two.

Well, they may be the only two
that know Nadie's true identity.

To everybody else,
it's just a name.

Cool.
Let's do it.

You understand?

All right, gentlemen,
get out of here.

I'll set it up.

Is this what four years of college

and six months in the academy
gets you these days?

We wouldn't have to put
rookies on the case

if you were in control
of your own backyard.

In the last two years

San Antonio has become victim

to organized crime

and drug trafficking
at an intolerable level.

Our children are becoming

drug addicts and criminals

right before our very eyes.

This must come to an end.

If you know of any illegal activity

or of anyone involved
in this epidemic,

please contact
your local authorities immediately.

Hey, you gotta pay your tab.

Well, how much do I owe you?

$15, plus tip.

15 bucks for three beers
in this shithole?

Here's a tip:
Why don't you clean this bitch up?

Just pay the tab, pinche guey.

Empty out the fucking register,
now!

Nobody fucking move.

What?

Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

Drop the gun now!

Hey, relax.

You're under arrest.

I figured.

Watch your head.

We have one in custody.
10-4.

Fuck you, asshole.

I'm too sexy for my shirt...

Yeah, what's up?

Yeah, I just got here.

All right, all right.

You're free to go.

Apparently someone thinks
you're worth a damn.

Derek?

Surprise, surprise.

Damn.

Hey, man.
Look at you.

Look at you.
Moving up in the world, huh?

Just a little bit.

Badass.
Just doing my thing.

Did you bail me out?

Hell yeah, I bailed you out.
How do you think you got out of there?

Thank you.

I don't know how to repay you.
I can't repay you.

Don't worry about it. I got you.

Is that yours?

Hell yeah. Come on, let me
show you what else has changed.

Where the hell you been at, man?

In there.

I used to be on the block all day

Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

I flip that, did hits and I'm on

They still want to lock me up, oh

They want to give me life...

Listen, grab yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.

All right.
What are you having?

Oh... vodka on the rocks.

So how long has this place been open?

About two years.

What do I owe you?

Oh, nothing.
It's on the house, man.

Oh, rock 'n' roll, man. Thanks.

Bobby Ramirez.

Bobby Ramirez.

Come on, man, get over here.
God.

Good to see you, man.
Good to see you. How have you been?

Damn, look at you.

What's up with you?
That's the question.

Well, you know, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

I need some of that.

It's good to see
you and Derek doing so well.

Yeah, you know.

What kind of trouble
are you getting yourself into?

Eh, you know.

Little college boy,

you were all straight and narrow
and shit, come on.

People change.

What do you mean?

I fucked up, jacked a bar.

Yeah, don't worry,
I won't be robbing this place.

God damn,
that's what I'm talking about.

Shit.
Fucking money's tight, you know.

That bad, huh?

Eh, shit just kind of went downhill
after Pops passed.

Yeah, I heard about it.
I'm sorry, Bobby.

No, don't be.
It's just life.

Anyway, how's Julian doing, man?

Oh, he's killing it, man, working for
some big company up in New York.

No shit.
Who'd have ever guessed--

that little bitch
always scared and shit?

He'll surprise you.

Hey, let's--
let's grab two shots.

Don't worry about paying me back
for bailing you out.

Joe, let's get two shots
for this guy,

celebrate my boy's return.

Joe.

Don't you got something to do?

Yeah.

Never write it down...

Salud.
Cheers.

If you riding it right

If you riding with us,
you riding for life.

Shit, whatever happened to Melissa?

Oh, dude.

She left my sheets
all bloody, man, oh.

You know,
I videotaped that shit too.

I videotaped that motherfucker.

Come on, come on.

God damn, you've done well.

Well, you'd be amazed.
By what?

What?
You said I'd be amazed.

Yeah, well, you'd be amazed

at what kind of money you can get

by not doing shit.

What do you mean?

You hear of Nadie?

Nadie?

Yeah, Nadie.
What, is it "no one"?

Yeah, Nadie--
he's a real person.

No.

Well, he's the world's
leading importer-exporter.

In what?

Do you work for him?

He bought you that shirt?

Yeah, he bought me
this fucking shirt, yeah.

Bought you this house?
He bought me this fucking house

and these shoes
and this fucking watch.

No, I am him.

What, you're Nadie?

Yeah.

So what do you import?

Anything and everything.

You see, the thing is,

I never get my hands dirty.

How?

I broker the shit.

I'm the organizer, the maker,

the pusher and the seller.

But I never touch anything.

Why are you telling me this?
You asked.

Yeah, I know I fucking asked,
but this is some heavy-ass shit.

You fucking asked.
You fucking asked.

Man, Bobby.

You should come work for me, man,

put a little--
a little extra change in your pocket.

No. I don't know, bro.

What?
You don't know?

You don't know?

I don't know.
You know what?

You're the same fucking pussy
you were in high school.

You are the same
fucking pussy you were in high school.

Nothing fucking changes.

The same fucking pussy,
like this, look.

Come on, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

I just got popped two seconds ago.

And?

Anyway, how do you know
you can trust me?

Shit, man.

After all we've been through...

all we've been through, man...

why wouldn't I?

Shit. Fuck.

It's nice seeing you,
motherfucker.

It's nice seeing you.

Good to see you too, man.

Aww, man, fucking Bobby.

Come on, get one.

Get one, huh?

Get one. That's some
high-quality shit right there.

Courtesy of Nadie.
You.

Courtesy of Nadie.
I think I like Nadie.

My turn.

My turn, motherfucker.

You dumb motherfucker!

Oh, motherfucker.

You know whose money
you're fucking with?

Oh, fuck.

Jason just funds everything

and we do all the actual work.

He just kicks back
and watches his bankroll get fatter.

Have you seen that guy's house?

Can he be traced though?

Only if we can connect
Jason to the buyers.

See, each buyer sets up
a dummy company,

and that company
pays Jason.

And he's smart.
And he's not greedy.

He doesn't nickel-and-dime shit.

Oh, shit, there he is.

Did you know he was gonna be here?

Come on, Bobby,

do you really think
this is a coincidence?

Bobby.

Mira ese pinche guey.

Holy shit, man.
Good to see you, papá.

You didn't tell me he was in town.

He just got in.

May I?

Yeah, have a seat.
Good seeing you, man.

Bobby, is everything good?

What happened?
No, it's just this thing.

Yeah, I put a couple guys on it.
It's cool.

All right.

What brings you to town?

The job, man-- I got laid off,

had to come back home.

Sorry to hear that, man.

Shit happens, you know.

It's all right.

Hello. What?

Yeah, I'll be right there.

Sorry, guys, I gotta run.

Hey, but don't worry about
losing your job too much.

I... may have some work for you.

Gracias, man.

Yeah?
Yeah, appreciate it.

You game?
Yeah, you know me. I'm down.

All right.
See you later.

All right.

What the fuck is Julian
doing back around here?

I guess he just moved back.

I could use the manpower right now.

I don't trust that guy.

Yeah, but he's cool.

All right?

Remember...

we were all there.

Let's go.

What the fuck are you doing?

What?

I thought you weren't
supposed to get involved.

Come on, Bobby, I'm tired
of being a fucking desk monkey, bro.

I signed up to see some action,

you know what I mean?

Look, I get it.

Okay?
I just didn't--

I just didn't want you
on this side of things.

What, Bobby?

What, the drugs, the partying?

Man, you forget we used
to run these streets together, bro.

Give me a little credit.

I got this.

Then look me in the eyes
and tell me you got this.

I got it.

Okay?

Okay.

Has Jason mentioned Gina yet?

Gina? No. Why?

I haven't even seen her.

You should ask him about it, bro.

You get the tickets I sent you?

Yeah, I did.

Are you excited to be coming out?

Mm, I don't know, Bobby.

You know, I have beauty school.

And you know what my instructor said?

That I'm a natural.

Well, yeah, but I--

I spent a lot of money on those tickets.

What do you want me to do, Bobby?

I can't just drop everything

and fly across the country
just to go see you.

What are you talking about?

I mean, you promised.

Okay, I'm gonna come.

I love you.

I love you too.

I'll be waiting for you, okay?

Adiós.

What's happening?

How are you doing, brother?

Good to see you, man.

Hey, brother.

Bobby.

Thank you.

To the man who keeps
our pockets fat and us out of jail.

En los ojos, ¿eh?
To you.

Seven years of bad sex.
Seriously.

Having a good time, Bobby?

Can't complain.

See, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

Hey, get up.

That's what I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

See, when you left,

Gina and I-- we--

you know, I hope there's
no hard feelings, right?

How are you, Bobby?

You know, I've been. And you?

I can't complain.

You should go.

I don't know what to say, Bobby.

A prize like that needed
someone to take care of her.

A trophy always needs polishing.

It's like you said,
I'm the one that left, right?

It is what it is.

We cool, right?

Hell yeah, we're cool.

I mean,
look at all you've done for me.

That's right.
That's right.

Derek, I need to talk
to Bobby about something.

Take your girl.

No, no, Julian, Julian,
you're good.

You're good.
Have a seat.

Come on, let's go.

There's a job I need
you to do for me.

What is it?

It's a little vacation.

I need you to go to
Mexico for me.

Work hard, play harder, right?

That's right. That's right.

That's that.
Come over here.

Hey, Brent.
How are you doing, man?

Hey, Derek, what's up, bro?

Dude, the señoritas
in here are prime.

We try.

Listen, how did that--
that lead I gave you-- how did it go?

Oh, yeah, man. Hey, you really
helped us deliver on that one, man.

Good.

If there's anything
we can do for you,

you should let us know,
all right?

Anything you need, man.
I appreciate that.

Matter of fact, you know what?

I have some friends
that just came into town.

I haven't seen them in a while.

I want you to run them for me.

All right, we can do that.

All right?
Mm-hmm.

Cool.

Joe, take care of them.
Have a good time.

There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

The average is 80 points a game,
and the guy's a freshman.

Hey, Terry.
You know what I mean?

It's all about the young talent.

It's like college teams are
always better than the pro teams,

that's all there is too it.
'Cause the pros don't give a shit.

They're making too much.
Baseball, basketball-- you name it.

Don't even get me started
On soccer.

It's the most boring sport
that's ever existed.

I honestly don't understand
how people can watch it.

It's like you kick the ball,
you kick the ball,

you kick the ball one way--
nothing happens.

You kick the ball, you kick the ball
the other way-- nothing happens.

So boring.
Final score-- one-nothing.

That's exciting.

What?

Jesus Christ.
I told you.

Jesus.

There's the man.
Fuck, bro.

Escobar called.
He wants his fucking house back.

Have you ever had your nails done
by an Asian woman?

Uh, no. Have you?
Fuck no.

Well, I have this theory.

See, a man with clean nails

cares for himself.

A man that cares for himself

cares for his life.

I find it tends to cleanse
my conscience,

like a Catholic, you know,
saying those Hail Marys.

Do you care about your life,
Julian?

What the fuck are you
talking about, J?

No.

Why did you do that?

He's our brother.

No no no!

He was your brother.

And your brother was
a fucking pig.

That's impossible,
you sick fuck.

Is it, Bobby?

Oh, man,
look what you did to him.

Is it?
Look at him.

Why the fuck did I have a camera

following me around
for the past two weeks?

I'm not stupid.

That's fucking bullshit.

Who told you that, huh?

Tell me, motherfucker!

Don't forget who I am.

What kind of brother doesn't know

his own blood is a fucking cop?

I should pop you too.

Yeah? What are you accusing me of?

Huh? Huh?

Say it, motherfucker!

Say it!

After all we've been through.

I live my whole life

with blood on my hands

from what you did.

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

Man, give me-- give me--
give me the gun.

Give me the fucking gun.
Let her go.

Let her go. Let her go.

Get the fuck out of here.

You got work to do.

Be happy I'm gonna put this
motherfucker where he can be found.

Why did you do this to him?

Oh, man.

Oh, and, hermano,

you should thank Derek
for keeping us out of jail--

all of us.

I mean, really,
I mean, how well--

how well do you really
know people anyway?

Huh?

Come on.

Oh.

Please just-- just take--

just take care of him, please.

Why did you do it, Maria? Why?

Put that pinche gun away.

You're not gonna do anything, pussy.

You're a fucking pussy.
I hope your son doesn't end up like you.

Eres un pedazo de mierda,
bueno para nada.

This is bullshit.

Listen, Bobby,
I understand how you feel, I do.

Look, I don't understand
why we can't just

bring him in on a murder charge.

I mean, he shot Julian
right in front of my fucking face.

I understand that.
I'll testify.

All right? We can get
the Asian lady to be a second witness.

Walk with me, son.

A single murder charge
is a state conviction, all right?

The FBI is not gonna risk blowing

an undercover operation
that could take down

the single largest drug trafficking
organization in North America

on simple murder charge.
A simple murder charge?

That's not what I meant.
Now I said I was sorry for our loss,

and you need to fucking
understand this shit.

Bigger picture, son.

Look at this objectively.
We're a collective.

That loss affects
each and every one of us.

We can lock him up
for the rest of his life.

And we will.

Julian was my brother, man.

I know he was, son.

I mean, he's--

he's the only family I have left.

I mean, Jason can't just
walk the fucking streets

and Julian's--

Listen.
Listen to me, Bobby.

You can end this.

We gotta to do this the right way.

If you're gonna get
emotional on me,

I gotta yank you out of
this right now.

I don't want Julian's death
to be in vain

any fucking more than you do.
I don't want that,

but we need to get this guy Jason
on federal charges--

drug trafficking,
organized crime,

multiple murder convictions.

You want this motherfucker to go away
and never see the light of day?

Is that what you want?
This is the way you do it.

But you gotta look at me
and tell me you're capable.

Look, I promise you something:

if we don't pin anything on him...

I will fucking end this.

Aim, fire!

Aim,

fire!

Aim, fire!

Recover!

Let's go.

I'm so--

Hello, Mr. Ramirez.

It's a pleasure to finally
meet you.

We've been expecting you.

Please, this way.

Well, it's about
a 20-minute drive to your hotel.

I'm sure they will be
serving dinner by then.

Maybe you and your friend
would like to go out.

There is a very--
how do you say?

--crazy nightlife here in our city.

Friend?

Yes, a gentleman
by the name of Derek.

My eyes

Follow you around the room

And I

Only ever look

At you

The way you move

Get a feeling I can't hide

It's up to you

If we're gonna do this

Tonight...

What the fuck are you doing,
pendejo?

Pinche seamstress or what?

Can you bring in my dress?

I'm losing weight.

Hey.

Hey, Derek.

Look at me, shithead.

Just get out, Mom.
You're drunk.

Why are you always sewing

that Cavaricci shit on your pants

and those ducks from my
purse on your shoes?

Maybe if we weren't so poor,
I wouldn't have to.

Hey, I work hard for this family.

You show me some respect.

On your back.

Fucking shit!
I fucking hate this!

Who the fuck are you?

Look, I don't got time
for this shit, all right?

I got a delivery from Nadie.

What happened to Derek?

I don't know.

So are you gonna let me in?

I look kind of stupid sitting
out here with a fucking duffel bag.

So why'd they send you?
What happened to Derek?

Yeah, it's like I said,
I don't know.

Probably found a nice
piece of ass down in Mexico,

missed his flight back, you know?

A nice piece of ass, huh?

Yeah, well
you know Derek,' right?

Yeah.

I gotta make a call.

Why don't you grab a beer?
I'll just finish this in a bit.

You know, it's cool.
I'm gonna go and--

Like I said, have a beer.
Nico, get this dude a beer.

He's here.

Yeah. Yeah, he brought it.

So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

Shit, I've known him my whole life.

Huh.

Funny, I've never met you before.

Yeah, it's funny.

No, bro.

Sit down.
Take it easy.

It's gonna be a minute.
You're gonna do a few bumps, right?

Uh, you know what?

I had a late night last night.
I'm cool.

Two it is.

So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

Shit, hell of a lot longer than you.

I told you I was cool, man.

I think you need a little pick-me-up.

Come on, just one line.

What's the problem?

Why don't you tell your boy
over here to back the fuck off?

Hey, calm down, Bobby.
No need to get out of hand.

Bobby, huh?

I never told you my name.

Like this, huh?

No, not like this.

Son of a bitch.

Fuck.

Fuck!

Motherfucker's got a boney face.

What the fuck are you doing?

Huh? Fucking reading comics?

Give me the picture.

Give me the fucking phone.

Come on.

Will you come pick this up?

Hey, shithead,
come pick this shit up.

I swear to God, man,

if my sister wasn't having
your fucking baby, man,

I would kill you right now,
you know that?

Oh, yeah, I'd stab you
with my fucking gun, man.

You'd stab me with your fucking gun?
That makes sense.

That's good.
Yes, stab you with my--

shut the fuck up, man.

Fucking kill you.

How could you do this, man?

You sadistic fuck. Huh?

You're a sick motherfucker, man.
You know that?

Right?

Huh? You're sick.

How am I supposed
to make you look like this, huh?

Hey, get off your fucking ass, man.

It's your shot.

Let's go.

Fuck.

Fuck.

What did you get
yourself into, huh?

Do you think we enjoy this?

I'm a cop, okay?

This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

Actually,
maybe it hurts you more.

What are you doing?

Pick him up.

Pick him up.

You know, I...

I should kill you right now.

You know?

I should fucking kill
you right now.

No one would care.

No one would cry.

And no one would ever
even miss you.

But I-- I can't.

I can't.

Why-- why can't I?
Why the fuck can't I?

I don't-- I don't--
I mean, I don't care.

I don't care.
I don't-- I don't--

it's not gonna make me sad.

Maybe--
maybe it's because--

maybe it's 'cause I want to know--

I want to know some things.

Remember that time we held up

that taqueria on-- on Mission?

Remember that?

You and Julian

were so fucking scared.

You guys were always

a bunch of little fucking bitches.

And that-- that got me thinking.

What makes a better cop...

than, you know,

a little bitch with a gun?

You know, I had to go
back to that place

and clean up that mess
all by myself.

True story.
I wouldn't lie about that shit.

I would not lie about that shit.

That shit was scary as fuck.

I was scared.
That shit was horrible.

I'm only gonna ask you once.

Are you-- are you--

are you a cop?

He doesn't have
the huevos to be a cop.

Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

You-- I mean, you really really
fucked up Derek, man.

I mean,
he is hurt pretty fucking bad.

Why, man? Huh?

He grabbed my dick, bro.

He grabbed your dick.

Oh shit, that's...

that's funny.

That's fucking funny.

You want to know
what else is funny?

Yo!

Derek, I--

You wore a mask
to cover up your pretty little face,

but I saw your eyes, my friend.

I'll never forget these eyes.

Let me ask you something:

Is the pain you
inflicted on my face

still on your hands?

Huh?

Answer me,
you piece of shit!

Why did you do it, man?

Hmm?

Once you found out
Julian was a narc,

you should have been happy
he was gone.

Now I hate to admit it,
bro, but I--

I really really really
really loved Julian.

I did. I did.

But, I mean, I had
no other options, really.

I mean, this--
this dumb shit right here--

I could care less
what the fuck you do to him.

I mean, shit, man, if you knew

how much trouble he caused me, you--

I-- I should thank you
for disciplining

this motherfucker.
I should.

Thank you. Thank you.

I want-- I want to know, Bobby.

I want to know.

Just fucking shoot him al--
Would you shut the fuck up?

Get the fuck out of here.

Rodriguez, get this
motherfucker in his car.

I'm just saying.
What about Derek?

Leave this fucking cripple
here with me.

All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Damn it.

Fuck.

I need you to tell me, Bobby.

I won't be mad.

How well do you really
know somebody, Jason?

What? What?

Be-- be-- be clear, motherfucker.

How well do you really know somebody?
What?

What?

I'm a narc.

I'm a motherfucking federal agent,
you dumbass.

I did something with my life.

And you-- all you did was hurt

and steal and take.

You make me fucking sick.
You know that?

Wow wow wow
wow wow.

Oh, shit, man, I--

I was just trying to scare you

for getting Derek
and fucking my chick, but--

but--

I don't even really know
what's fucking going on.

What the fuck?

Oh, fuck.

Derek, have at him.

Come on,
fucking have at him.

Come on.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

What's taking you so long,
dumbass? Come on.

What's taking you so fucking long?

Hey.

Hey, pull the fucking trigger!

Oh, you're fucking useless, man.

Oh, you are fucking useless.

I'm useless?
Yeah, you're fucking--

I'm useless?
Yeah.

No, fuck you!
Whoa whoa.

Fuck you, man!
Whoa whoa.

Fuck you, Jason!
Whoa whoa whoa. Hey hey hey.

Hey, back the fuck up, man!
Back the--

Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
You know what?

My whole fucking life
all you've ever done

is tell me
how stupid I am.

Guess what:
I'm not stupid, Jason.

No. I'm sorry, Nadie, right?

That's what you like
to be called, right? Nadie?

What kind of stupid-ass name
is that anyway, huh?

Shit, if anyone should be
called Nadie, it's me.

Because I'm always
treated like no one!

I got a brain.

I can think.
I know how shit's run, man.

I know how it's run.
I've been running it.

I don't need you.

Hey, hey, hey, man!
I can do this without you.

Shut the fuck up!

Oh. Oh, fuck.

My life's gonna be
a whole lot happier being a boss.

Fuck!

Hey, please.
Please, man.

I will make it
all right, man.

Hey, please.

Please stop talking.

Fuck!

Just let me finish.

It's about time.

No no no no no no no!

Damn it.

He said stay in the fucking car!

Derek, Derek.

Shit.

Derek, Derek, please.

Please, man, Derek.

Shit.

Derek.

Derek.

You gotta un-cuff me, man.

Bobby.

You remember that time that we ate

at that joint off of Mission, right?

The one--
the one that Jason wanted to rob?

You remember that, right?

I do.

I think about it a lot.

I think about it a lot.

And I remember-- ow.

I remember how you and Julian--

you guys didn't want to do anything.

And me-- I--

I just wanted
to fit in.

I mean, I was never
the cool guy, you know?

I-- I never had the nice shoes.

I never had money.

I just wanted to feel important, man.

Fuck important.

I just wanted to be accepted.

You-- I mean, you had Julian,
you know?

And Jason--
he never needed nobody.

But me--

Me--

I did.

I did.

Where was
my best buddy, huh?

Where was my best buddy?

And now shit's all fucked up, man.

Shit's-- shit's all fucked up.

And I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do.

You guys were right, man.

You guys were so right.

That poor girl, man--

she haunts my dreams.

And that cook-- that cook--

he didn't have to die.

He wasn't gonna
tell nobody.

He was an illegal.

She haunts
my dreams too, bro.

Yeah?

I mean, that's the reason
that Julian and I--

you know, the reason we went
and took the road that we took.

But you have to know

that one day doesn't define a man.

Right?

You have to un-cuff me,
bro. Come on.

Man, I appreciate you, Bobby,

I really do.

Jason--

he never really cared about me.

He just wanted
to treat me like an ass.

Oh, shit.

Sorry.

He's sensitive.

But you and I
both know, man,

as soon as we
walk out of here,

I'm gonna be popped
with all kinds of shit.

No. No.

Yeah, come on.

Look, you don't have
to do this, Derek.

I'm gonna miss you, bro.

Dios.

Bobby.

I'm so sorry.
Take the handcuffs off, please.

I'm sorry.

You gotta believe me.
I'm not like this.

I just knew this would happen.

Jason was just too crazy.

And then when I got home,
I found this note.

What note?

He thought I was
leaving him for you.

I'm just-- I'm glad
I overheard him talking the other night.

I'm so sorry, Bobby.
I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.

You have to go.
No.

Yeah, you have to go.

Go. It's okay.
No.

Go. It's okay.

Bobby?

Bobby?

Are you okay?

Is everyone here accounted for?

Yeah.

The captain put a tracker on you
when you were a no-show.

I guess you owe him one.

Can I get some help over here?

Let's clear it.

I remember when my father
used to take me to play catch.

He used to keep me out
till the sun went down,

take me home, make me wash up

and then go straight to bed.

I wish every father
would go that far

just to make sure their kids didn't
make the same mistakes they did.

Julian used to get on my case
about my attitude.

He told me I should be happy

for all the things
God had given me.

Now I know he was right.

I was lucky to have a brother
like him.

Happy birthday, bro.

A great man once told me

that one day doesn't define a person.

He was right.

We all have the ability
to create our own legacy.

What's up, Cap?

Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

What's going on?

You were pretty tight
with Jason's crew, right?

Yeah.
What do you need to know?

Anybody you can think of
that would be capable

of taking over that operation?

Why are you asking?

Nadie was just a name,
Bobby.

And somebody's still using it.

Oh, oh, oh

I used to be on the block all day

Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

I flip that, did hits and I'm on

They still want to lock me up, oh

They want to give me life

Oh, oh, oh

They want to give me life

All right, yeah
They want to give me life

All right, I wear the shoe
if the shoe fits

'Cause we was born
with ambitions of being rich

We was born with ambitions
of hitting licks

My mama said it'd
be days like this now

This here was Bugsy shit,
that real Bugsy shit

Oh, yeah, we copyright,
them niggas counterfeit

See, them niggas just
ballin' in they daydreams

Me and Norm finna go
and cop the Saleen

Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

Where the critics at?
They had a lot to say

I guess these niggas mad,
old and out of date

See, me, I'm like Hov,
I don't write shit

Took my dogs
to Hollywood, Mike Vick

You riding the shit,
if you riding it right

If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

I used to be on the
block all day

Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

I flip that,
did hits and I'm on

They still want to
lock me up, oh

They want to give me life

Oh, oh, oh

They want to give me life

Oh, oh, oh

They want to give me life

All right, I wear the
crown if the crown fit

But all kings get killed,
so I don't wear it much

I hit the stage,
city to city, and tear it up

Straight raw lyrics,
I put my heart in it

But nowadays they don't like it
when you spit the truth

They want that bubblegum shit
that they're used to

See, these niggas in the game
for the wrong reason

Sitting on the bench
for the whole season

Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

The powers that be,
I see, was trying to hate

But Bugsy always on time,
never late

I'm riding with it,
these other niggas just ride around

Never leave evidence,
never write it down

If you riding this shit,
if you riding it right

If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

I used to be on the block all day

Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

I flip that, did hits and I'm on

They still want to lock me up, oh

They want to give me life

Oh, oh, oh

They want to give me life

Oh, oh, oh

They want to give me life.
