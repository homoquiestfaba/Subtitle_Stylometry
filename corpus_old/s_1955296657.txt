It could be a case of distemper.

Or rabies.

Rabies.

No Mr Grizzly,

Me (mumbles) cat not

So do not tell me that
it's a case of rabies.

Huh look.

Look.

because of heart attack.

And if she happen to die,

I will hunt you down.

What's the matter Mr Grizzly?

Nothing, nothing boys.

This madman keeps saying
that our famous cat food

is in poor condition.

Go away boy and leave me alone.

Don't play with me.

Or I'll shove the
cat down your throat.

Keep it easy boy,

it must be a solution.

A solution,

of course there is a solution.

Sooner or later.

young boys like you,

Do you need to ask?

Great harvest as I always say,

I don't understand,

Mr Grizzly who did you
sell the factory to?

Mr Morris.

Let me introduce you
to the new owner.

An American entrepreneur
who saved me from bankruptcy

by buying the factory.

Which from now on will be
called Lotus Cat Food factory.

A cat food factory boss?

That's it Bandit,

experience Mr Morris

wants us to start a new era
in cat food manufacturing.

Mr Morris.

Do you think we are done?


Then let's go try it.

(upbeat music)

You two.

Mrs Livingston.

Is there anything
wrong Mrs Livingston?

You've been hammering
whole night long.

Yes,

we've been working.

[Mrs Livingston] I had
to get up eight times.

Six to go to the bathroom

and three because you
won't let me sleep.

(upbeat music)

Friends and neighbours
of Villa Catalina

it's an honor to share
these words of joy

with all of you.

Along with affection
and warm (mumbles)

to receive this
great business man.

He will make our cats
lick of pleasure.

And of course also our pockets.

[Mrs Livingston] I'm
going to destroy you.

Look, look what I'm

cat calf here?

Spaniards.

(ominous music)

(crickets chirping)

You just had it Bill.


There is the only way
to get out of poverty.

And whenever Mr
Grizzly say something,

he's right.

I know Bill but

do you think what
we are going to do

is right?

Now.

corrupted one shall burn

in the cells of hell.

Oh whatever you say.

It was very dark Mr Grizzly.

We couldn't see who she was.

I can't put up with you.

Okay Grizzly calm down,

take it easy.

But Mr Grizzly do

doing is right?


We'll go to hell.

Listen to me,

and what is right.

And this is perfectly right.

So let's go to work.

There are plenty
of cats to feed.

Come in, come in.

What no rest.

More than ever we
must go on producing.

People want more food
and I want more money.

So we can't disappoint
anyone, right?


But Mr Grizzly
Bills hands hurt

and my headache is
becoming stronger.

What can I do?

We can't stop now
to keep producing.

But, but...

No buts.

Back to work.



(upbeat music)


(upbeat music)


(upbeat music)

(thunder crashing)

I must congratulate you

on obtaining the best
results in the past 30 years.

Congratulate the
operation for me.

But as you know within
the next two days

we celebrate the
annual feline fair

which is a great
opportunity for us.

You see if the
judges and organizers

like our canned food we can
obtain a juicy fat contract.

Do you know what that means?

Money.

That's why we must
innovate the product

and make it something more.

New?

Hmm,

yes maybe.

Something more.


Exactly.

We must ensure that all cats,

not only in Spain,

but all over the world

eat our product.

Let me handle this Mr Morris.

We will begin working on
a more addictive food.

The new Lotus Cat
Food golden line.

Golden.

I like it.

Perfect.

Buy now, here's the fee.

(phone ringing)


the mayors secretary has called.

Tell him...

Good morning to everybody.

What can I do
for you this time?

Let's see.

I basically came to
congratulate you.

I've learned about
the great success

of the new Lotus Cat Food.

And I said I must
visit to Mr Morris

in person to deeply
congratulate him.

Yeah we're making it big.

That's right see,

we've approved a new
law at the city council

about canned food,

and of course...

How much this time?

Mr Morris you offend me.

But a 20% would be enough.

Oh outstanding.

I didn't expect less from you.

It's great to see how
money fixes everything.

Well I'm sorry I
can't stay longer

but I had to meet
with the holy priest.

His niece has disappeared.

Gentlemen see you.

Politics.

Hey boys.


(cat meowing)

What do you want?

More food?

You already eat.

I will give you no more.

And don't be bad.


(cat screeching)


Mommy.




(cellphone ringing)

It's my boss.

You better go.

Mr Gualtieri can I help you?

Can you help me?

Well can you help me.

You were supposed to
let me know the news.

And you were
supposed to inform me

of everything daily.

Okay Mr Gualtieri,

I've been a little bit busy.

These Spaniards are driving
me a little bit crazy.

And the mayor is
enacting new laws

to make more money.

Well if the mayor's
causing a problem

you already know what to do.

And by the way I'm still waiting

for you to send me the
samples of the new product.

Okay Mr Gualtieri.

Okay.

I'm going to be sending
you something very special

very soon.

These red necks

but they a little bit dopey.

But they put interest.

Yeah we'll see.

Hey listen I set you to Spain

to save money on
the minimum costs.

You understand what I'm saying?

And now what,

and now you already
spent much more

than anticipated.

I gotta tell you the truth,

I'm not very happy.

Piece of shit.

Well sometimes it is necessary

to cover my (mumbles).

Shut the hell up.

Hey listen I want those samples

and I want 'em this week.

You understand?

And I want you to
start production soon.

Any more delays
and you're going to

spend the rest of
your short life

selling encyclopedias
ya piece of shit.

Encyclopedias.


(mechanics beeping)


(mechanics beeping)

How are you boys?

Tired Mr Grizzly.

We haven't slept in days.

My head hurts badly.

And Billy has
broken out in a rash

on his face.


Come on, come on.

It's not that bad.

Here you are boys,

you deserve it.

Wow Mr Grizzly
what a nice gesture.

[Mr Grizzly] You
like sweets, huh Bill.

We are very grateful.

You know that I want
the best for my boys

and even more if you are
doing an excellent job

tell me what else
can I do for you?

Now that you say it,

we'd like a uniform.

A uniform?

Yes like the ones
that mechanics wear.

All right you'll have them.

Oh Mr Grizzly
thank you so much.

But before that,

you've got to do
something for me.

Whatever you want Mr Grizzly.

As you already know

in a very short time

a juicy contract
will set on the line

on you to make a
new better product.

Don't they like
our current one?

Yes it's perfect.

But I need you to press
those moronic brains

you have and make me a new,

a new mix.

A more addictive for me.

What I need is that

the more the cats
eat our product

the more they want it.

Do you understand?

I think so Mr Grizzly.

These are my boys.

(cat meowing)

Let's see how you respond.

(cats meowing)

Hey.

(dramatic music)

(cat meowing)

That's enough.

I won't feed you more.

Arnie whose cat is that?

Why is Mr Beezly
the 2nd in a cage?

(cat screeching)

(bell chiming)

(ominous music)


Hey Ted you want your stuff?

Let me see I think it's here.

I got it.

Here you are.

To be honest I don't know
exactly what you want to do.

Whether you want to
throw a big time party

or commit suicide.

This potion will make your
soul shoot out of your body.

What's in it?

Can't you guess?

(ominous music)

Do you think it will
be addictive enough?

You know what,

you're scaring me.

Toby.

Oh.

and fell to the floor.

And (mumbles) caused this?


Well what do you want from me?


An autopsy?

Yeah.

On what part of the cat?

Hey Doctor, what I wanna know

honorable visit for?

Nothing, nothing.

Just wanted to see
how things are going.

And don't forget if
you need anything

whatever it is,

I'll be here for you.

But what's new?

Talking about the that.

The city council, we've
approved a new law

Not much,

Bill said we'll wait for
the uniforms to get here.

But this blood could be yours.

You telling me that

Ah excuse me Mr Colombus,

but the lady's in shock
after what happened so,

anyway when I got here
she told me that the cat

was eating as usual
and suddenly got crazy

and attacked her.

Are you sure you
didn't hurt the animal

in anyway?

No.

Just in case what did
you give it for food?

Hey I am the one
asking questions here.

Just in case what do
you give him for food?

Uh Lotus Cat Food.

She said that ever
since she started

to feed the animal with that

it's not exactly
acting like himself.

It's behaving badly.

Badly?

What do you mean?

But it's not what you think.

Well never mind,
