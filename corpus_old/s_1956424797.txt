Cover yourself!

[bell ringing]

[Rose-Lynn moans]

[Rose-Lynn] Oh, fuck, yeah!

[imitating American accent] All
the way from Glasgow, Scotland,

please welcome a little girl
by the name of Rose-Lynn Harlan

to the Opry.

Rose-Lynn Harlan, ladies and gentlemen,

performing for the first time
here in Nashville, Tennessee.

[Rose-Lynn] Whoo!
Fuckin'-A.

Right, I'll see you.

When?
[siren wailing in distance]

When?

[birds chirping]

[gate squeaks]

[doorbell chimes]


[Rose-Lynn] Oh, hi.

[door creaks]

Come on, Lyle. Come on.

Where do you think you're going,
all done up like a fish supper?

got you down, so he has.

That's scary. Don't do that.

Anyway, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm having my dinner wi' yous.

[Lyle chatters to himself]

[chatters to himself]

He never shuts up, you never speak.

What's going on in there,
eh? Sponsored silence?

Did you miss me, eh? Hmm?

[door opens]


[door closes]

[sighs]
[woman] Rose-Lynn?

I thought you were your mum there.
[Rose-Lynn laughs]

That cannae have been 12 month.
The time's went in like that.

Aye.
[door opens]

Hello, Marion!

Night, both of you.

[door closes]

She looks good. Amanda.

Aye. So she should. Enough time at it.

Does she still lie out here on tin foil?
Oh, aye.

One peek of the sun and
that one's in a bikini.

Other day she was in after my butter.
Your butter?

Puts it all over her.
"It's natural, Marion."

Aye, natural if you're a roll.

[Rose-Lynn chuckles]

Mary was gonna come tonight to see you,

but she's awful bad
with her arthritis, so...

Oh, that's a shame.
Aye.

It's in her knees now so
that's her had to retire.

It's, uh...

Eight pound an hour, holidays.

Says she'll see you into
it as a favour to me.

Cleaning, aye? Aye, very good.

Why, what were you thinking?

Thinking? No.

I wasnae thinking. I've just got
out. Don't you worry about me.

No, I wasnae. I was
thinking about your kids.

I'm going to Nashville.

Well, you better mind your tag doesnae
go off when you're going through security.

First thing I'm going down the
Opry I'm gonna get my job back

and I'm gonna work for it.

There's nothing for me here.

There I can be honing my
craft, out gigging every night.

Honing your cra...?

Do you not think you've
sacrificed enough for that fantasy?

Have we all not sacrificed enough?
How's it a fantasy?

It's the only thing I'm good at.
Learn a trade.

Go to college.
You're not listening.

I don't care what you do, but do something.

I've got my talent and I'm gonna use that.

Have you not been watching telly?
There's no shortage of folk who can sing.

[door slams]

[man on TV] <i>...a high, distinctive
whistle as they fly home over the water.</i>

[banging]
Argh.

Fuck's sake!

[muffled scream]


[woman on stereo]
<i>â™ª I beg your pardon â™ª</i>


Back to back, out, in.
<i>â™ª I never promised you a rose garden â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Along with the sunshine â™ª</i>
Turn.

Sandra. Watch your feet!

Oh, the Lone Ranger rides into town.

Do you wanna get me a wee beer, Jackie?

Don't watch your neighbour!

Eyes on me, no' your neighbour!

[Rose-Lynn] So, what have I missed?


[Rose-Lynn] Aye.
Well, then,

there's nothing new under the sun.

I hear you're on the tag.

Cannae fart round here.

Aye, I am, but I've appealed it, so
a couple of weeks I'll be brand-new.

Fridays and Saturdays, boom.

Fridays and Saturdays we've
got Mississippi Tundra.

[Rose-Lynn] Who?

[Rose-Lynn laughs]

Christ, yous must be desperate!

Nobody wants to see a
convicted criminal up there.

Folk come here to get away from all that.

Johnny Cash was a convicted
criminal, you bawbag.

Anyway, away back to your mousetraps.

I need this job, Jackie,
and it's my fucking band.

It's the house band. You're
your own worst enemy, you.

I wouldnae agree. There's
strong competition.

Fuck you! Fuck off!
Fucking stupid cow!

You nicked my job, did you?
Get off! Get off me!


Get your hands off me!
Get out.

Ten year I've been working here.
Right, you're barred.

Get out!
Fucking no-fucking-hopers' clubhouse!


[bottle smashes]

Fuck!


How's your lassie?
[Marion] Oh, ask me tomorrow.

[lively chatter]

He lives in the bottom half of the house.

There's another house up the stair.

My mate Andy lives there.

And then they bought the house next door.

Lauren lives next door with a wee balcony.

[song continues through headphones]

[intercom beeps]


Fuck's sake!

They've got CCTV,

so anything you do to that
gate, we can see from in here.

I've not done anything to the gate.

You were effing and blinding at the gate.

Shoes off.

[woman chattering on phone]

Ah, that's so sweet. [chuckles]

Oh, yeah, that's fine. That's fine.


Yeah, I've got to go.
I've got someone here.

Ah. Okay.

Pleasure. Speak to you later. Bye.

Hello! I'm Susannah.

Hi.
Thanks for coming.

So, um... where have you
been working before now?

She's been up in Stirling.
Haven't you, Rose-Lynn?

But she's no plans to go back.

Oh, it's beautiful up there.
Majestic.

Yeah.

Right, I'm off to spend a penny.

So, it's Â£12 an hour.

Twelve? Actually, Mary gets...

Eight pound? Right, but...
she can afford to go that low

because she's on the brew as well.

Brew? She drinks?

I don't think Mary drinks.
No, no.

The brew is like, you know, the dole.

Really?
Mm, yeah, yeah.

Whereas I'll not be up
to anything like that.

It's just not me. Know what I mean?

Don't embarrass her by mentioning it.

Oh, you were needing more bleach, Susannah.

I'll give you the receipt for it.

Oh, okay. Thanks.


Rose-Lynn?

Oh, Jesus!
Rose-Lynn? Sorry.

Um, I'm just gonna pop out and...

I'll be back in about an hour, okay?
Okay.

Or... or maybe less.

I'm in and out all day so I don't
know when I'll be back. Just...

[music playing on headphones]
Great.

Right, see you in a bit.

Yous gave me a shock.

Where's your mum?
[both] Parking the car.

Yous are like something
out of <i>The Shining.</i>


[clock ticking]

Huh.

Well, are yous coming in?

[child squeals in distance]

[bird chattering]



Yeasty.
<i>What smell?</i>

Well, I don't know, but it sure as
hell isnae somebody baking bread.

<i>Hang on a minute.</i>
[music on phone]

She won't touch ham and
he won't eat anything but,

and they've both now decided
they don't like yoghurt.

Have you got a calendar?
You need a calendar.

For putting down their gym days

and their holidays and if they're
needing to bring something in.

Nine times out of ten
they willnae tell you,

so you need to go through
their bags once a week

and you need to pay these.

You can do it. You've got a wage
now and you can pay in instalments.

Your gas, your water
and your electricity...

and...

your TV licence as well.

Okay-smokey. Well, that's you set up here.

Remember, you have to be
in immediate range of that

from 7.00 at night until
7.00 in the morning, okay?

[knocking]
[man] Hello?

Hi?
Excuse me?

Hi. Yeah?
Is that your wee boy out here?


Lyle?
[Lyle] Open up, it's the police!

Lyle? Lyle!
Hi-ya!

Hi...
[Marion] Get in here.

Right now!

[pans clattering]

Right, that's me away.

You know where I am...

if you need me.

No, no, you're staying
here with your mammy.

But you'll see me every day.

You'll see me every day, dafty.


your mammy. Now, be a good boy.

Come on, take hold of him now.

Take hold of him.
[Lyle cries]

[Rose-Lynn] Come on. Shh, shh.


[Rose-Lynn] No, you don't. Shh, shh.

[Lyle screams]
[Rose-Lynn] Come on, Lyle.


[Lyle continues screaming]

[train rumbling past in distance]

[chattering outside]

See, on Friday, will we
go out for our dinner?

I remember what your favourite is.

It's pizza.

I like sausage, cheese, tomato.

She likes cheese, tomato and cheese.

[Rose-Lynn] Are you coming with us?

Hmm?


[Rose-Lynn] Right, that's me away.
Okay.

The kids tell me you're a
country and western singer.

Are you taking the piss?

No! No, not at all. Why do you say that?

Country and western? No, it's just country.

Oh, I didn't realise.

You must be very good because all
I've heard all week is "Rose-Lynn."

Why country?
'Cause it's three chords and the truth.


Wow.

And it goes like that, just
gets whatever's in there out.

Anyways, I'll see you next week.

Thanks very much. Bye.

Bye.

[chattering, laughing]

All right. Thanks.

Oh, sorry. After you.

Him, that fucking prick.


Shit. Sorry, mate. Fuck.

[woman] Get out!
Fuck.

Oh, sorry, pal. Sorry.
Watch yourself.

Ah, don't worry about it. It's fine.
[groans]

I'm all right, Davey.

That's me. You fucking idiot!
No, no, no. I just fell on the floor.

Where you going?
I've got my curfew.

Never mind the curfew. Come on, stay.

Drink mine.
Stay. Oi!

Fuck!

[phone ringing]

Hello. Galloways the
butcher's. What can I get you?

Yeah, I'm playing with you.
I'm only kidding you on.

Aye, yeah, Rose-Lynn Harlan.

I'm here.

All right, okay, bye.

Oh...
What happened to pizza?

You cannae promise them
something and then just disappear.

You cannae do that.
I didnae disappear.

I was at my work, waiting on my wages.

Please! You're not
fooling anybody, Rose-Lynn.

And you cannae fool me.

See, you tell them something,
you don't go back on it.

That's basic.

That's basic.

<i>â™ª As you said in the

[steam hisses]

[knocking]
Come in.

You know, I was um... I was just thinking,

I could give you some recommendations.

Like, strong women and all that.

Oh, I'd love that. I'd love
that. I'd love to hear you sing.

Where do you sing? Is there,
um... Is there a scene?

Oh, no, no. No, there's fuck-all here.

It's actually what I'm...

I'm actually trying to get to Nashville.
Oh.

I'm needing to raise a couple of
grand so I can get flights and a hotel.

I cannae drive, so I'm
needing a driver as well.

It wouldnae be more than two or
three, definitely less than five.

Oh...

Rose-Lynn, I...

I'm sorry, I can't just give you
money, if that's what you're suggesting.

I'm sure it wasn't.
No, it was.

I can't do that.
How no'?

I'm not being funny, but I just thought

with all the smelly
candles burning everywhere

and bottled water and all
that, you wouldnae miss it.

I'll be old and grey before
I've saved up, whereas you...

I mean, yous could just
drink out of the tap.

Anyways, never mind.

[door slams]

What are you actually doing...
while you're waiting, saving to go?

I've been the star fucking attraction at
Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry since I was 14.

And?
And what?

Nothing.

Why haven't you gone in for
one of those TV talent shows?

They're no' for folk who can sing.

They're for folk who want to sit in
with their saag aloo and watch the telly.

Isn't it a way of meeting someone here
who can introduce you to someone there?

There's nobody here. That's why I'm away.

No one in the whole of Britain
knows anything about country music?

Except me.
Except you?

Yeah. And Bob Harris.

Who's that?

Well, he's a DJ at BBC Radio 2.

Pure legend, man. Ancient wee guy.

He knows everything about country
music. All the stars, they're his pals.


That's who you need to write to.

Aye, yeah, it's good thinking. I'll
just away and pop round his house!

No, I cannae do this.

Why not?
'Cause I feel like a fanny.

Okay, you two, go on outside.

No!
Yes, ten minutes.

All we're gonna do is
listen outside the door.

It's... it's fine. It's fine. It's cool.

You sure?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

[exhales]

Goodness! Amazing!

[clapping, chattering continue]

[Susannah] Want to stay for dinner?
Oh, no, thank you.

Thanks.

So, where do you stay, Rose-Lynn?

Priesthill.

Ah, Pollok way.
Aye, yeah.

Sam's from Clydebank.
Clydebank?

How did you get here from
Clydebank, break in through a window?

Learned a trade from my father
and then I started up on my own.

[Rose-Lynn] Aye? What trade?

Conservatories?

Is that they big glass things
stuck on the side of houses?

I'm no' being funny, but who
needs a conservatory in Glasgow?

You'd be surprised.
Oh, aye, I would be.

[Sam] What are you looking for?
[Rory] iPad.

[Sam] Did Mum say you can have it? No?
[Susannah] No.

Tell you what, let's go
play some football, eh?

Oh, you're getting heavy, boy.

Do you want kids, Rose-Lynn?
Aye, yeah.

Just not yet.

How was school today?

Is Mrs Pat still there?
Oh, she hated me, Mrs Pat.

Is Miss McDonald still your favourite?

Miss McDonald left.

[water running]

[train rumbling in distance]


You hungry?
Mm-hmm.

Hmm?


"Dear Susannah, so wonderful to
hear from you after all this time.

I passed your email on to Liz.
Remember Liz used to piss in the sink?"

She, um... Oh, she works on
the <i>Today</i> programme

and she sent the link to her
husband who covers sport for Radio 2

and he forwarded the link
to Bob Harris's producer.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my fucking God!
Wait.

"Bob would be very happy to meet her
if she fancied coming down to London

to watch a live recording."

Do you know how many times
I've written to that wee bastard

and how many BBC pens I got back in return?

How did you do that? How
did you even fucking do that?

Sent a few emails.
I cannae be...

I cannae believe it. I'm fucking shaking.

That is just...
Oh.

Thank you, thank you. That
is fucking mental. Brilliant!

Whoo!

Bob Harris?

Whispering Bob Harris?

Aye.

[gasps, sings] <i>â™ª BBC Radio 2 â™ª</i>

Aye, I know, I know. It's mad.

That would be some doors
he could open for you.

Is... Is it all right if you babysit?

Oh, of course she will.

How did this come about?
Susannah.

Oh. Very nice of her to help you.

Can she unlock tags as well?

You served 12 months

for attempting to smuggle a
package of heroin into Cornton Vale

by throwing it over the perimeter fence.

I didnae know it was heroin.

But you were reckless as to
what the package contained.

If you mean, was I off my face and
didnae ask what was in it, then aye.

I had wains and everything
and they give me the jail.

Pure ridiculous.

That's what my advocate said at
the time... it's no' my fault.

Well, whose fault was it?

Well, it was the judge's, obviously,
for giving me the sentence.

Your Lordship,

a more contrite young lady
it would be hard to find.

Ms Harlan has done a
lot of soul-searching.

She has... dug deep.

And she's put her childish ways behind her.

She now works full-time as a daily woman

and her children are
living with her once again.

Though Ms Harlan is no longer in prison,

neither is she free.

Wearing a tag means she is
unable to seek employment

in her own line of work.

You just told me she's a daily woman.
Yes.

But if you turn the page, sir...

you'll see my client is also

a promising young country
and western singer.

[Rose-Lynn scoffs] Oh, for God's sake.

It's just "country."


My lord, this young lady must
be allowed out in the evenings

if she is to make a new start.

[music playing]
[chattering]

[cheering]
Yeah!

You are barred.
You can take that up with my lawyer

who'll be having a whisky and Coke.

[Elliott laughs]

you, what did I just say?

She's barred!

Outlaw State Of Mind!

Jack, tell her!
<i>â™ª ...in no time at all... â™ª</i>

Go back to your mice!
What is this? What the fuck?

Stop that, will you?

[Alan] This is a joke!
Off you bop.


Rose-Lynn Harlan!
Whoo!

Come on!
You bitch!

<i>â™ª Cut my teeth on

Ah, gracious as ever.
There you go, just in case.

Oh... Oh!

Thank you, thank you!

and getting a crime reference number.

Are you okay?

Do you need to phone someone?

I'm only trying to help her.

Sorry! Excuse me!

Sorry. Sorry, mate.

Hi, I'm looking for the
B... I'm looking for the BBC.

Right, okay, you'll need
to take the Tube down to...

What? No, I don't have any mon...

Do you know where the BBC is?

Oh, thank fucking God!

Hi. Rose-Lynn Harlan.

Who are you here to see?
Bob Harris.

Have you got any ID?
No.

No, some bastard stole my
bag on the way here, so no.

Right. I'm gonna need you to sign in.

What, is it MI5 here?

Jeez, they give you less
hassle in the police station.

Are you Rose-Lynn?
Aye.

Hello. I'm Mark, Bob's producer.

Oh, jeez, it's so good to see you, boy.

[gulps]
You got here, then?

Aye, I did.

So, the studio is through here,

and... round here is our control room

and in the control room is Bob Harris.


You must be Rose-Lynn.
I cannae believe it's you. Oh!

Honest to God, I thought you'd be tiny wee.

[both chuckle]

Oh, is that where they go,
Miranda Lambert and all that?

All they folk who come in here?
It is, yeah.

And we've got someone
fabulous playing later.

Would you like to have a look around?

So, this is very exciting,
meeting a home-grown country star.

From Glasgow! I mean, it's
a great music city, Glasgow.

Oh, yeah? I'm trying to get
to Nashville, obviously, but...

I mean, who's ever heard of
a country singer from Glasgow?

That's ridiculous. It cannae be.

Why not?

Well...

See my life? My life's like
being one of these transsexuals.

You know? When you're born a man, but
you were meant to come out a lassie.

Yeah, that is me. I should
have been born in America.

I'm an American, but here I am.

Do you write?
Oh, no.

Can you play?
[burps] No.

Honestly, I don't think it matters

whether you're from Glasgow,
Scotland or Glasgow, Kentucky

if you've got a voice and
you've got something to say.

I watched your link, and
you really do have a voice.

So, what do you need to say?

[acoustic guitar playing]

<i>â™ª Don't waste your
life on that guitar â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You may get gone But
you won't get far â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're not the first â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You won't be the last â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You can tell us all about it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you come crawling back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That road you're on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just winds and winds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're spinning your wheels â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're wasting your time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When the lights come up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I hear the band â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where they said I'd never
be Is exactly where I am â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I hear the crowd â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I look around And I
can't find an empty chair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not bad for a
girl going nowhere â™ª</i>

[footsteps inside]


Where's your bag and your jacket?

Susannah just picked me up
from the station just now.

I left it on her back seat.

Was it good?
Aye.

[water running]

What like was it? London.

It was hoaching.
Oh, that's what Mary said.

She's been down a couple
of times to see her nephew.

Says you cannae move for people.

Honest to God, wherever you
go people are up your nose,

in your mouth, under your nails.

I couldnae stand that.

What was he like? Bob.

I think he was...

He was saying I'm needing
to write my own tunes.

What am I gonnae write about? The
bleach ran away with the broom?

You don't stick at things.

You know, that's your trouble.

But look at this house.

When you put your mind to something...

you can do anything.

Do you want a cup of tea?
Oh, no. I'm away to my bed.

I'm up early the morrow.

But you can ask me for my dinner.

Lyle's telling me how he
likes your mince and tatties

and he doesnae like mine.

[Marion chuckles]
I don't have a mince.

My mince is your mince.

Night.

[door opens]

[door closes]

Did I wake you up?
No.

I wanted some water.

[water running]

What's your book about?

About a girl and her dog.

That sounds a bit babyish for you.

Key Stage 2.

Boo! [laughs]

Why are you doing that?

I don't know.

Here, I'll take you back to bed.

[birds chirping]

[Rose-Lynn] Those are
nice. Who are they for?

This one's for Isla and
this one's for Shona.

Isla and Shona.

Yous have half-term coming
up. Do you know that?

You have a whole week off school.

What will we do, eh?

We'll go away for a few days, to the beach.

I've not went to the beach.
Yeah, you have.

You're too young to remember.

We went just before...

just before yous moved in with your granny.

You wanted to pick up all
the shells. Remember that?

How come we werenae allowed to see you?

'Cause your granny didn't
want you coming to the jail.

Who else was gonna bring you?

'Cause of baddies?

Aye, uh-huh.

You werenae a baddie,
though. You were an outlaw.

Who told you that?
You did.

No, I wasnae an outlaw.

I was a fanny.

You said fanny!

How was it? I tried
calling you so many times.

Oh, I know. I lost my phone.
No! What happened?


Actually, it got pinched.
Oh, really?

Yeah, out of my bag, with my bag.

Crap.
Didnae matter.

It was fucking-A!
Was it?

Really?

I'm gonna get there. I am
gonna fucking get there.

Yes, you bloody are.

Listen.
Yeah?

I'm gonna be 50 in a minute and...

I was gonna have this drinks party for
which I've got very little enthusiasm for.

'Cause over the weekend I realised
what I really need is a "party" party,

a great big fuck-off house party,

featuring, say, a set by... a
young up-and-coming country singer,

Rose-Lynn Harlan.

What? You want me to play at your party?

Yeah. Will you?

Well, aye, yeah, course I will.
That is brilliant.

That is not the exciting bit.

The exciting bit is,
instead of bringing gifts,

people will contribute to a cause
that is very close to my heart... you.

You perform a set.

If people like what they
hear, which they will,

then they invest in you, in your career.

That's, like, a hundred people
spending between Â£50 and Â£100.

VoilÃ .

By the magic of
crowd-funding, you are there.

Where?
The Isle of Man.

Nashville!

What, you're gonna tax your
pals to come to your house

for an audience with your daily woman?

Yeah.

You've lost the plot, hen!
[Susannah laughs]

Oh, do you have a band?
Aye, yeah, course I do.

When is it?
Next Sunday.

You've already booked the week off,
and you can use that time to rehearse.

Oh, no. No, I cannae do that week. But
it's cool, I don't need to rehearse.

I've been playing with
these guys since I was 14.

Rose-Lynn, you definitely
need to rehearse.

If you're asking people for money, if...

If you want people to buy in to the
idea that you're gonna make it out there,

then you need to put in a
really professional performance.

Oh, yeah, cool, yeah. Fucking-A.

Brilliant.

Whoo!

[Susannah walks away]

Well...

I cannae fault it.

[both chuckle]

Mum?

Susannah's needing me in next week.
She cannae have you.

Kids are on holiday. She can
do without you for a week.

You said you'd take them away.

Well, it's no', uh... it's no'
cleaning I'd be doing, it's rehearsing.

I'm doing this gig at her house.

She's invited all these people
and I'm gonna perform with my band.

And then they're gonna invest.

Invest? Invest in what?

In me, in my career,

in getting to Nashville.

Oh.

I don't remember her investing in Mary
when she was in agony with her hip.

Eighteen-month waiting list.

If she'd money to spare, she
could have forked out on that.

She isnae forking it out.

She's giving me a chance to earn it.

But it's got to be good, no pub band.
We havenae long to put it together.

I phoned the school to see about
holiday club, but it's all full up,

and I'd rather they were with you
'cause I don't want them thinking...

Thinking what?

That you cast them off
when you get a better offer?

Or that all this is for nothing 'cause
you've still got one foot out the door?

I cannae help you.

I havenae booked the time off.

You've been there 20 year.

Special circumstances.
I've used that enough.

Aye, when I was fucking up.

What's for you will no' go by you.

This is me trying to
make something of myself.

Surely to God that's a good thing for them.

A good thing for them?

No' letting them down
again and again and again,

that would be a good thing for them.

And I thought you'd turned a corner.

More fool me!

[Wynonna] Where are we going?
[Lyle] To the beach.

We're going to go into the sea
and look at different jellyfish.

Come on. That's a good boy. Come on.

Here we go.

Oh, in yous come.


Mary's gonna look after you
for a wee while this week, okay?

I didn't say a week,
Rose-Lynn, I said today.

[Lyle cries]
[Mary] Oh, you're fine, you're fine.

Come on. Mum'll be back. You'll be fine.

[door slams]
[Lyle cries out]

[Rose-Lynn] <i>â™ª Well, I never did
crawl And I never did toe the line â™ª</i>

Ah, no. Come on, this
is... It's way too slow.

<i>â™ª Well, I never did crawl And
I never did toe the line â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No man is master of
me I ain't that kind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just put on my

<i>â™ª If you want to win â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You just can't lose the time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Or stay behind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well, I was born to run â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To get ahead of the rest... â™ª</i>

[children arguing]

<i>â™ª And all that I wanted
Was to be the best â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just to feel free â™ª</i>

Mum!

<i>â™ª And be someone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I was born to be fast
I was born to run... â™ª</i>

Thanks, Amanda.
Oh, nae bother, nae bother.

Yous know me from old, don't yous?

We can play a wee game... hotels.

You can be the waiter and
waitress and I'll be the guest.

See yous later, okay?

I hate you!


Right, come on.

<i>â™ª ...makes you feel all right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well, I was born to run â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To get ahead of the rest â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And all I wanted

Yeah! That was much better.

lassie invested in? Rod Stewart?

Right, now, it's been a long
time, but I do love a call sheet.

So, if you could all be
here from 4.00 tomorrow,

then we'll run sound check from 4.30,

and after that... we'll
go to the lighting cues.

Big day tomorrow, gents. This
girl has cleaned her last floor.

[man laughs]

don't have to do that.

No, it's all right. I'll just...
I'll just pop them inside.

I nicked it from the tech guys.

Fancy a smoke?

Oh, no, I've... I've got to go.

Really?
Yeah.

Can you roll it?

When I first met Sam,

we lived in this shittiest
little flat on Clydeside.

There was nothing there,
not like it is now.

We had rats because of the river,

we were broken into nearly once a week,

but we had these really,
really amazing parties.


Don't really want this.

Do you have someone?
No, I'm... free as a bird.

Lucky you.

You're young.

You're incredibly talented. You're
at the height of your powers.

There is nothing you can't do.

This is your time.

Once you've got kids, it's
a little bit different.


Yeah.

[door closes]

I'd better go.


How are you, honey?
I'm fine, thank you.

I'll drop you home.
Oh, no, you're all right.

It's fine. I'll just take the bus.
No, come on.

Sleep well.
Aye, yeah.

See you in the morning.

You homesick, aye?

[Rose-Lynn laughs]

What, is this the one where you
try and stick it up the daily woman?

No, no.

This is the one where I
tell you that I'm on to you.

I know you did the jail.

And I know what you were in for.

Susannah's bought into
whatever it is you're selling,

and I'm not about to take
that away from her now.

But I don't want you
anywhere near my kids, so...

See the morrow?

Sing your song, get your money,

then you're gone.

[exhales heavily]

Lyle, hurry up.

We haven't got all day.

Rosie! Where you been, man?
Havenae seen hide nor hair of you.

[key turns in lock]

All right, wee man?
I'll be in in a minute.

[children arguing]

You all right, pal?

Aye, you know, I'm brand-new.

[thudding from inside]


Lyle?

His name's Lyle. He's five.

He swung on a wardrobe and it fell on him.

I think it's just his arms that he's
hurt, but maybe his head as well.

Okay, Lyle, do you mind
if I have a wee look?

Ow!
Shh, shh, shh...

All right.
She's gonna have a wee look, okay?

Any allergies?
No, I don't... I don't think so, no.

Fabric plasters.

Okay, um, we'll need to X-ray him.

It's one of those nights in here,

so it might be a while
until a doctor sees yous.

[Rose-Lynn] Okay.
[Lyle] I want my granny.

Shh, shh...
Please! I want my granny!

Please! I want my granny!
It's okay, it's okay.

[curtain opening]

Are you Lyle's mum?
Aye, yeah.

Dr Yousaf. I'm sorry about the wait.
No.

The X-ray looks fairly
straightforward, but he'll need a cast.

When can we go home?

We can't get the cast on
until the swelling's come down,

so we are looking at a couple more hours.

I'm sorry it's been such a long night.


Where is he?
He's still asleep.

Right. I'll take this one home and
you can stay here with the wee fella.

No.

No.

What's for you will no' go by you.

Maybe 20 year in the baker's is enough
for you, but it's not enough for me.

Away and get me a wee cup of tea, darling.

What's the matter with you?

I just... I just need you to help.

Help me.

Help you? Help you do what?

Leave him here while you go
to a party? Is that the plan?

I don't know what this awf'y
toffy woman thinks you are,

but she wouldnae give you a brass
farthing if she knew the truth.

You havenae even told her, have you?

She doesnae even have a
clue that you've got kids.

If you're no' even prepared
to acknowledge their existence,

there's no hope for you.

And there's sure as hell none for them.

Go. Go to Nashville.

Do whatever it is you
wanna do. Come on, darling.

Let's go see your wee brother.

<i>â™ª To hear a sad song... â™ª</i>

[crowd chattering]


<i>â™ª I couldn't get
you on the phone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I let it ring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On and on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In a lonesome serenade â™ª</i>

[laughter, chatter intensifies]

<i>â™ª Maybe I should
try to find a way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To kinda, sorta,
maybe work it out â™ª</i>

Rose-Lynn! Where have you been?

Jesus Christ! I thought
you were a no-show.

The band have had to talk me off a ledge.

You look tired. Are you all right?

Oh, yeah, aye. I'm... brand-new.

Oh, good, good.
Great.

Come on, let's go. You
gave me such a fright.

<i>â™ª And a double-barrel
whisky... â™ª</i>


Okay, um...

so, not long ago, a spark of
light flew in through my door

and reminded me of why I fell in
love with Glasgow in the first place.

The girl, like the city, is gallus.


She's funny and, above all
else, she's completely fearless.

And with your help,
she's going to Nashville

to do what she was put on this earth to do.

I'm so proud to know her
and call her my friend.

Ladies and gentlemen, put your
hands together for Rose-Lynn Harlan!

[cheering, whooping, applauding]


Okay? Let's go.

[accordion plays]

[guitars play]


[rhythmic clapping]

[sound fades, distorts]

[heartbeat pounding]

[breathing erratically]

Sor-sor-sorry. Can
you just give me...?

Give me... give me five.

[murmurs of surprise]
What's wrong?

Rose-Lynn?

Hey? Hey!

Rose-Lynn, please.

What's going on? What are you
doing? Where are you going?

What's happened?

Oh, darling. Come on.

I don't know what... what you see
when you look at me, but it isnae me.

What are you talking about?
I'm not at the height of my powers.

I'm not free and there's
so, so much I can't undo.

I can't undo going to the jail.

I cannae undo chucking in heroin

to all they lasses in there
already fucked from drugs.

And do you know what else I cannae undo?

Having two kids.

Two beautiful children before I was 18.

Wynonna, she's eight,

and Lyle, he's five, and I...

I got 12 months in the jail
and I left behind two kids.

Yeah, that's the truth.

Not this.

That, them.

Everything I made you think I am...

I'm not.

Sorry, I'm just...

[dog barks in distance]

[gate hinges squeak]

[dog barks in distance]

[chattering on TV]

[Lyle groans softly]

Come on.

[gull cries]

I see an island over there.
An island?

It's a clam.
Do you think you can open it?

[distant chatter]

Miss Harlan?

[no audible dialogue]

I mean, I'll be happy just...

All right, then.

[electronic beeping]

[talk radio on]

<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

Hooray!

Did you make a wish?

You can have mine.

Right. Who's having the first slice, eh?

[Lyle] Me.
[Rose-Lynn] Yeah? Good.

[children chattering in distance]

[gate hinge squeaks]

[sighs softly]

[door opening]

[Marion] It's only me.
Hi.

Hi.
Have you got a wee minute?

Aye, yeah.

You already gave me something.

What's this for?

Why are you giving me this?

I wanted you to take responsibility,

but I never meant to take away your hope.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Maybe there is more to
life or maybe there isnae.

I don't know.

I've never been further than Dunoon.

But you need to away and see.

No.

I cannae start all that up again.

It's finished.

I always said I'd go to college

if I hadnae had to go to work at 15.

And I would have.

I wanted to be a pharmacist.

The thing is... [scoffs]

what was stopping me, you know?

Even after I had you, I could have gone.

But I think it was just easier for me to...

to want things for you

than to go after them for myself.

I hadnae the gumption.

That's the truth.

But you...

you do.

I'll look after the wains.

You go.

You see what's waiting for you.

Where did you get all this money from?

Amazing what you can do...

20 year in the baker's.

Welcome to the Ryman, the
mother church of country music.

This is the exact spot
where bluegrass was born

and where Johnny Cash met June Carter.

Now, it was right here that
country music found an audience

beyond its own back porch

and countless careers took off.

Now, when the Grand Ole Opry
put down roots here in 1943,

the live radio and TV show
brought the likes of Elvis Presley,

Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins,

Minnie Pearl, Patsy Cline, and Roy Acuff

to the stage and into living
rooms all around America.

chords out of me, honest to God!

[audience laughs]
Anyway, I'll give it a go.

<i>â™ª I've worn out the stones â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In front of your doorstep â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Coming and going â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Coming and going â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You left the lights on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I always knew that â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I should have said thank you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A thousand miles ago â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I pushed you away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Put a pin in a map â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then I got lost in the storm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Had to find my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make my own mistakes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But you know
that I had to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no yellow brick road â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Running through Glasgow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I've found one That's
stronger than stone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Moon hanging low â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Over my window â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Shoebox of dreams â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hid under my bed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Follow the bright lights â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª City of gold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I had to leave to realise â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I needed was here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mama, we both know
That there's nothing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That a little time And
Patsy Cline wouldn't fix â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Had to find my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make my own mistakes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But you know
that I had to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no yellow brick road â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Running through Glasgow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I've found one That's
stronger than stone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll just click my heels â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Three more times â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There it all is â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What's always been mine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no yellow brick road â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Running through Glasgow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I've found one That's
stronger than stone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't no place like home â™ª</i>

[song ends]

[cheering, applause]

Whoo-hoo!

<i>â™ª Robbing the bank of life â™ª</i>

[song ends]

<i>â™ª Wear this, don't wear that
Don't step out of place â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just smile, don't say too much
Put that make-up on your face â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just keep pretending
You're having a good time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause that's the price of fame
When you're standing in te line â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the view from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the view from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's like
champagne and tears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When all you want's a beer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Keep your loved ones near â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, keep your
loved ones dear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause famous folk are weird â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the view from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh-oh,

<i>â™ª Mm-mm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, hey, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mm-mm,

<i>â™ª That's the view from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, that's the
view from here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's like
champagne and tears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When all you want's a beer â™ª</i>
