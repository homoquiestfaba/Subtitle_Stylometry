Yo! [scoffs]
[boy on phone]<i> Listen to this.</i>

<i>Amber told Stacy she was down to do
some nasty shit with you after the game.</i>

Macon, slow down, slow down.
Wait. Okay, which one is she?

<i>You met her a hundred times. A-hole.</i>

Hogwarts? [chuckles]
No, no, fuck that. You'd have to pay me.

<i>She's throwing herself at you!</i>

No, I'm serious.
Not even for, like, a million...

<i>flat-chested and pissed off like Hailey.</i>

<i>Maybe, just maybe you should
lower your standards once in a while.</i>

Um, Macon, hold up one second?

[timer ticking]

Mom?

Sadie?

I don't know. It's nothing.
[Macon] <i>I thought they were gone.</i>

Yeah, they said
they were tailgating before.


The fuck!

I swear. My sister is licking
the powder off the Doritos

and putting them back in the bag.
Fucking body dysmorphia at age eight.

<i>And I was a weird kid.</i>

[ticking grows louder]

I'm just gonna crash before...

[Macon]<i> Little stress relief!</i>
Dude, I don't pregame that way.

<i>Why are you so serious right now?</i>

'Cause it's like pure protein.

Why would I want good protein
out of my body before...


Yeah, I'll be there.
Kickoff's in like four hours.

<i>lose protein for four hours.</i>

Have fun pregaming, perv.

You're in my house,

so I can legally kill you,

you fuck!

Come out!





You want money?
Because I can Venmo you right now.

Like, no one's gotta know.

Hey, hey, hey.
Look, man, we... We were all wasted.

It wasâ€¦
It was just, like, a team bonding thing.

Likeâ€¦ like, I swear.

This isn't who I am! This isn't

me?

Pick up the phone, son.


Goddamn it.

[boy in video]Â <i>Caleb, you okay, man?</i>

<i>Come on, man. You all right?</i>

[laughs, panting]

[ominous electronic music playing]

[girl 1] <i>Did you hear about Jackson?</i>

[boy 1] <i>So fucked up.</i>
[girl 2]<i> Terrifying.</i>

[girl 1] <i>Who would do this?</i>
[girl 3]<i> You saw that video.</i>

[girl 4]<i> Jackson was out of line.</i>

[boy 2] <i>So he beat someone up.</i>
<i>Doesn't mean he had to die.</i>

[girl 1]
<i>That was way more than hazing, though.</i>

[girl 5] <i>It was brutal.</i>
[girl 6] <i>He targeted Caleb.</i>

[girl 1]<i> Is it 'cause Caleb's gay?</i>

[boy 3] <i>Probably jealous</i>
<i>Caleb's the better player.</i>

[boy 2] <i>Caleb never even reported it.</i>

[girl 6]<i> So who told?</i>

[boy 2] <i>The whole team was there.</i>

[boy 4]<i> They think Caleb's behind it.</i>

[girl 7 scoffs] W <i>hat?</i>
[boy 2]<i> He was in the game.</i>

[girl 8]<i> He could've hired a killer.</i>
[phone ringing]

[girl 9] <i>Everyone got the video.</i>

<i>- Everyone.</i>
[girl 10] <i>The whole town.</i>

[boy 5] <i>To make a point.</i>
[girl 11]<i> What point?</i>

[girl 12] <i>Who knows?</i>

[girl 13] <i>I'm honestly scared.</i>
[boy 5]<i> What do we do? Go back to school?</i>

[girl 14]<i> I can't sleep.</i>
[boy 5]<i> I can't live here anymore.</i>

[girl 15]<i> The sheriff have a suspect?</i>
[boy 5]<i> He won't say.</i>

[girl 16]<i> So sad, though.</i>

[girl 17]<i> What if it happens again?</i>

[indistinct chattering]

[girl snickering]

What?

Store ran out of all the sad cards.

Did I say anything? I think it's great,
really. I love that optimism.

At least she got him something.

Sorry I don't know what to get a guy

who beat the shit out of me
for fun for three years.

Hmm.

Really?
Wow.

Built-in immunity. [laughs]

No teacher's gonna punish
the grief-stricken.

Oh, that's actually pretty smart.

Am I crazy, or are people
side-eyeing me right now?

You're never crazy, babe.
[sighs]

Caleb's getting it worse.
Fucked up they're blaming him.

Of course they blame the gay guy.


Jackson Pace
took a knee on the field of life.

But damn if he didn't live every day
like it was the fourth quarter.

I'll never forget you, son.

â™ª <i>In the mist</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>There was a purrâ€¦</i> â™ª

Oh no.

â™ª <i>And when that purr turned to a grr</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Six legs walked into the light</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And we knew it was time to fight</i> â™ª

Actually, he's not half bad.
[students] <i>â™ª So go, Cats, go</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>To victory</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>To God, his game</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And his glory!</i> â™ª

Hope they're serving Fireball
up in paradise, brother.

Now I wanna die.

we were having pizza, right?

And I was telling him
I was having trouble finding Stacy's clit.

Jackson goes with the pizza box,

makes a diagram with pizza sauce
to show me where it was on her body.

[boy snickers] Classic Jackson.

I'm literally right here.

I got a prime suspect. Macon Bewley.

Well, he's too dumb
not to get caught, so win-win.



Alternate theory. My dad.

Ah, you wish.

Think about it.

No way Jackson's parents
wanna live in that house

on that farm
where theirâ€¦ where their kid was killed

any longer than they have to, right?

Who else wants that farm
more than Skipper Sandford,

the land baron of Osborne?

"Chaos breeds opportunity, boy."
[girl 1 laughs]

for Sandford Family Farms."

[students laughing]


Uh.

Sorry. Thanks.

I'm Darby.

I know. I'm Caleb.

A pleasure to meet y'all,
I guess, officially.

Caleb.

It's not a country club, Caleb.

I'm Makani.

That's Rodrigo,

Zach,

and Alex. She's our bitch-in-residence.

Oh! Thank you.
[Makani] Mm-hmm.

[girl 2] My fellow seniors.
You think I'm bad?

[girl 2] If may have
your attention, please.

Thank you.

I mean, what can one say
in the wake of such sadness?

Yet as your student council president,

I feel it's imperative
that I provide a beacon,

a kind of guiding light
in these dark and trying times.

So, I'd like to read an excerpt
from my admission essay to Cornell.

It's about oppression.

Princess Diana of Wales once said,
in her infinite wisdom,

that, "The greatest problem
in the world today is intolerance."

Did bitch just quote a princess
instead of someone actually oppressed?

We have a student here at my school

who is an outer space enthusiast,

but that's not the only thing
about this student that's alien.

His name, or her name,

depending on the day, is Darby.

Born Justine Darby, this student
showed me the meaning of courage

when, at age 11, she came out
to our school as she, he, and they,

and now every day in my mind,

I applaud her, him, and them.

[all applauding]


[girl 2] Jackson's video
and his death were hateful,

and the only way to respond to hateâ€¦

Is with love.

We love all versions of you, Darby, okay?

Like we love all versions of Caleb.

So please, guys,

let's celebrate that love tomorrow
at the memorial at Holy Trinity.

For now, though, a moment of silent,

unenforced, nondenominational prayer.

Fuck these reactive people!

All of our college essays are about you.
You know that?

I will cut you.
[laughs]

It'd be great if Katie was the killer.
Or if the killer maybe killed Katie.

And you just said that. And I liked it.

[students chuckling]

[Darby sighs]
[Zach] "Sandford Family fucks."


I mean,

it <i>is</i> factual.

My dad is a fuck.

Wanna smoke?
[Darby and Makani] Yes.

["Bite Me" by Kilo Kish playing]
<i>- â™ª I don't give a flyingâ€¦ Ahh! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bite me, bite me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You can try me, try me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you likeyâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Caleb seemed cool.

[Alex and Zach laughing]

Okay, okay, okay.
Let me rephrase that, you dicks.

I like that you let him sit with us

'cause that's what you guys did for me
when I first transferred here.

Oh my God.
Those guys kept calling you Moana.

I love that movie.

It's not really an insult.
Not just those guys. That was Jackson.

So you've been biding your time, huh?

[all laughing]
[engine starts]

[tires screech]
Oh shit!


Speaking of most likely to murder.

[horn honking]

Who even smokes cigarettes anymore?

Oliver Larsson
because he's a fucking sociopath.

You think everyone's a sociopath.

his folks straight-up opted out of life

'cause their son had zero human emotions.

if I don't hear about that fellowship.

Last night, my mom said I could

"always answer phones
at the slaughterhouse."

Now I know why everyone
treats graduation like a death sentence.

In Osborne, it is.

literally the opposite of that.

It is the opposite of the end.

Yes. Yes!

It's the opposite
of the end, motherfucker!

[all cheering]
[horn honking]

[crickets chirping]

Just thought,

"Here you are, Sabrina,

asking your granddaughter
to take a big step with college and all,

and I won't even take
a tiny step to fix my own stuff."

So I signed up for next month.

Or if you just drank your tea.

Oh, man.

Heard you walking around last night.

You don't think I notice
you changing the subject?

Honey, I'm sure all this horrible stuff
at school is dredging up memories.

You need to focus here
on your application.

What's the point?
All they have to do is Google my name,

my real name,

and then all that financial aid
and friends I might've made is just,

"Bye." So what's the point?

The point is that's not you anymore.

I see you up there
in your mama's old room,

all her old stuff still on the walls.

Like you don't even have a say.

You have to stopÂ blaming yourself
for what happened.


But you gotta drink that tea for me.

Oh.

That'sâ€¦ new.

Gam.

[crickets chirping]

Gam?



Grandma, wake up.

You were sleepwalking again.

Did I?

Oh.

Maybe we should skip
the early service tomorrow, okay?

[church bell ringing]

Caleb's got to be behind this.

I think he hired someone.

'Cause all due respect
to the dearly departed,

but I have watched a lot of true crime,
and this was clearly premeditated,

right?

I mean, who do you think it...

Marcus?

[harp ringtone playing]

[ominous music playing]

Seriously, stop it.
[Marcus]<i> Uh, what?</i>

I know you're not sick.
[Marcus]<i> What are you talking about?</i>

'Cause I was just talking to you. Here.

You were right here.

[Katie on recording] <i>Some races</i>
<i>have higher IQs than other races.</i>

<i>- It's basic science. Look it up.</i>
[Marcus] <i>I'm not lying.</i>

Marcus, I'll call you back.

[Katie on recording]
<i>And yet these libtard academics,</i>

<i>who keep proclaiming
to be the protectors of science,</i>

<i>suddenly start crying, "Fake news!"</i>

<i>When all we're doing
is presenting scientific fact.</i>

<i>And why is that?</i>

<i>Because liberals worship
at the altar of equality and diversity.</i>

<i>Which means every little snowflake</i>

<i>has to be exactly the same,
and there can be no differences.</i>

Oh myâ€¦

[Katie on recording]Â <i>Makes you wonder</i>

<i>- how many good white Americans</i>â€¦
Look.

Hey, I don't know whoâ€¦
what this is. [laughs nervously]

Okay. Okay, so maybe I recorded,
like, one episode of a podcast,

but no one was supposed toâ€¦

I posted it anonymously.

Also, it's likeâ€¦
it's like satire, you know?

It's a goof.
Iâ€¦ I'm making fun of these fucks, right?

[Katie on recording]
<i>I am a racial realist, people.</i>

<i>Listen to my words,

<i>I'm not out here saying, "I'm a racist."</i>

<i>I'm just saying

I love that you wore yellow.

Hey.

[banging on door]
Aren't you glad you moved here?

[woman] Let me in!
[Makani]<i> What?</i>

I'm on the phone!
[woman] Did you lock the door?

[sighs]
[woman] Goddamn it!

Sorry, my mom is just like...
[Makani]<i> I know. I know.</i>

You ain't gotta apologize.

<i>so lucky you don't live with parents.</i>

You all right?

Oh yeah. I just... I have a cold.

Just been taking some cold medicine.

Hmm.

<i>I know this sounds selfish,</i>

but can't I just have a normal life
where no one gets murdered,

and I get a girlfriend, and I go
to college, and I get to program games?

I mean, is that stupid?

<i>It's stupid. Just... You can ignore me.</i>

You keep calling me, Ro,
when I know you really wanna call Alex.

I'm just kind of afraid, maybe.


I guess we can't hide
anything anymore. Can we?

[ominous music playing]

[indistinct chattering]

What do you think they're asking?

If you're white, "What's good on TV?"
If you're brown, "Why are you murdering?"

Yeah, hence this itchy-ass suit.


Think the killer's in this room right now?

I don't know.

Makes my head hurt.
Doesn't make sense, you know?

Like, why would the killer go after Katie?

Because Katie
and Jackson both had secrets.

[Rodrigo] Hey, look at his body language.
Look at his face.

He's touching his mouth.
He's not making any eye contact.

It's the two top-ten tells
someone's full of shit.

Hmm.

You see everything, Ro.


It's exhausting.

this happens all the time.

Football players getting brain damage.
They start stabbing people.

It's like... It's a thing.

You know it's just as clichÃ©
to hate football as it is to play it?

They're not the worst.
[Alex] They're the worst to you.

Confused, okay. There's a difference.

Mmm.

You guys are looking
at the wrong side of the table.

[Alex] The sheriff?
Hello?

There's a referendum
on the ballot next month

to dissolve the Police Department.

That's legal?
Replace it with private security.

But not if he solves a series of murders,

and by that, I mean blaming it
on someone who's not white

and becoming a local hero.

Comforting.

Or it could just be the most obvious.

Tragic past, no friends.

So, basically us.

What? No.

No, you guys just are who you are.

That's your thing.
You don't have any secrets.

Unless you got something
you wanna let us know.


Your dad's lawyer
just invoked your constitutional rights,

so you're free to go.



Careful out there, friend.

I, uhâ€¦ I drove myself. Soâ€¦

Dad, I'm sorry.

I'm trying to put those boys
out of business this next election.

I know.
Yet here you are.

I was halfway to
the International Terminal in Omaha when...

Everyone was coming.

My friends...
Friends? Those are not friends.

They are what's left
when no one else wants to know you.


You stink of marijuana.

I'm public enemy number one to those boys,

which makes you public enemy number two,
and yet you have the audacity...

No, I'm sorry, the goddamned stupidity

to smoke drugs and then
walk directly into the lion's den.

Take your truck home.

Get that goddamn graffiti buffed out.
It's embarrassing.

[indistinct chattering]

[typing on phone]

Hey, Ollie.

Hey, Makani.

I'm sorry, I'm staring. I justâ€¦
I got nothing to do till my brother's off.

Oh, I get it, Ollie.
Such is your burden. [chuckles]

Yeah, pretty much.

Did you cut your hair?
Yeah, I cut it myself.

Wow.

It's a good haircut, Ollie.

Also, I'm sorry I've been ignoring you
since school started.

I've just been...
Are you serious with all this?

Yeah, yeah.
I used scissors and everything.

[clears throat]

[typing on phone continues]


I have a theory.

[typing on phone continues]

I think you like being around
someone more fucked up than you.

Because it made you feel normal,
but then summer was over, school started.

You had to go back
to pretending you <i>are</i> normal,

which you're not.

That's a compliment.

And being seen with me
endangered that image.

That an original theory, or did you
just watch <i>Grease </i>for the first time?

[door opens]

Um, did you see anyone take my Taser?

No.


Makani Young.

It says here you transferred
junior year fromâ€¦


Did I say that right?

Umâ€¦

Any reason you left?

Um, no, I mean...

And you had no relationship
with Jackson or Katie at all?

Never argued, never sawÂ them
argue with somebody else?

No.

You seem tense.


[clears throat]

Look, it's pretty obvious here.

You're a good kid.

Work hard.

There's a lot of pressure
to be perfect. I'm sure.

Butâ€¦

[clears throat]

â€¦you say you didn't know Katie?

A lot of her best friends
are feeling the same way, that

they didn't know her at all.

It's funny how sometimes
it's easier to be ourselves

around strangers than our own friends.

I should write that down. I shouldâ€¦

You'reâ€¦ you're free to go.

Thanks. "It's funny howâ€¦"

There's curfew.

Okay, all right. Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

I have a secret. [clears throat]

Really? I thought
we were the ones with no secrets.

I have a secret crush onâ€¦

[clicking tongue]

Because you're dead-ass funny

in such a low-frequency way,

but I hear it, and I love it.

All right, all right! This is fun!
All right! Rodrigo, go.

What's your secret?

Same.
[yelps, laughs]

[Caleb] What?
Wait, really?

Um, Makani?

Um,

I write poetry.


And, uh, I'm not gonna graduate.

How's this for poetry?

"This letter's to inform you
that your son, Zachariah Sandford,

is at risk of failing classes."

"His current GPA is a one-point fucked."

[sucks teeth] Yeah,
but that's not the real secret.

The real secret...

[partygoers exclaiming]
Shit.

Whoa, whoa! Guys, whoa! Chill, chill.

The only thing
it's loaded with is meaning.

[girl 1] What? No!
[girl 2] Oh, my God!

Zach! Zach!
Dude!


[people sighing]
[boy] Dude!

Crazy.
Which brings me to tonight's main event.

[boy 1] Ooh.

[partygoers chattering]

[Zach] You laugh at me.
[partygoers] Yeah.

You make fun of me.
[partygoers] Yeah.

Youâ€¦ youâ€¦ you tag my truck.

Fuck yeah, we did!
[partygoers laughing]


You think that my father
is this festering pustule

disguised asÂ a God-fearing pillar
of the community.

He buys up your families' land
for pennies on the dollar.

And for what?

Just so he can grow his 30,000-plus
acre corporate empire of shit!

Fuck that shit!
[girl] Yeah.

But, what if I told youâ€¦

Skipper Sandford's collection
extended far beyond cornâ€¦

[partygoers] Whoa!
[boy 2] What?

â€¦and included the tenth largest
Nazi memorabilia collection

in all of North America?

[boy 3] That's fucked up.

A shocking amount of which

I have converted

into pipes, hookahs, and bongs.

[partygoers laughing]
[boy 4] Of course!

[boy 5] Dude, no way!

That's crazy.
So, allow me to propose a toast.

The 1% is burning down
the world so they can stay warm.

I say, "Let it burn down <i>them</i> too."

[boy 6] Yeah!

While we burn down Highway 420.

[Macon] Chips?

[Macon] Salt and vinegar?
Fuck off!

[whispers] Sorry.
[Rodrigo chuckles]

You're my secret. Yeah.

I see you, Ro.

I always have.


[dance music playing in background]

So,

see you back with the others?

Yeah. Thank you.

Didâ€¦ did you just thank me?

No.
[Alex laughs]

Sorry, thatâ€¦ that would beâ€¦

of everyone in attendance.</i>


Everyone's just moved on, I guess.

You're all coming to the game, right?

Sorry about your friend.

Just something I did to honor him.

You don't have anything to say about this?

I'm done talking about who I think did it.

I know who did it.

And now everyone else does too.


[whistle blows]
[crowd] Ohh!

Why are you even defending him right now?
I'm not. I justâ€¦

I mean, imagine if it were you, or D,
or Zach people were whispering about.

Who's that? The Wampus Cat!

Makani, you were at the party!

I called him out. He heard me!

Then Rodrigo talked shit,
and within one hour, Rodrigo is justâ€¦

I hear you, okay?
I don't know what you want me to say.

Call the cops if you're so sure.
They said she has no evidence.

'Cause she doesn't.
Because his brother's the deputy!

[players grunting]

The killer used a Taser, babe.

Who uses Tasers? Cops!

And who lives with a cop?

Giving him access to background checks
about everyone in town, including us.


[crowd cheering]

Katie's podcast <i>was </i>anonymous.

Guess who can request
connection logs from ISPs? Piggy pigs.

[grunting]
Makani, you weren't here growing up.

He was a disturbed kid in a real way.

Do you even know
what happened to his parents?



Go, Caleb!

Whoo!


so into gays
when they can win football games.

Do you just fucking hate everyone?

[somber music playing]

[phone chimes]

Tell me you didn't forget.

Right. Sleep clinic thing.
[Gam] Baby, I don't want you here alone.

You told me you were gonna stay
at Alexandra's tomorrow night.

Yeah, yeah. I, um,
was literally just texting her about it.

Proud of you.

The things I do
to get that infernal bell off my door.

[doorbell rings]


You just showed up.

I thought I'd take you
on a trip to the ocean.

Pretty sure that's, like,
a thousand miles away.

Not the one I'm thinking of.

[engine turns off]

[Makani groans]

I thought you were taking me to the beach.

Nope, the ocean.

Don't worry. The car's a piece of shit.

Okay?
Mm-hmm.

She will make us old."

When'd you write that?


Don't shut me out again.

Stay here.

Like this.

Good thing I know you're not dangerous.
I mean, I never said that.

Maybe that's why I brought you
out here in the first place, you know?

Where no one can find us.

Well, you'd have to know my secret first.

You think I don't?

think you love secrets.

You still won't tell
a single soul about me.

[phone vibrating]

Fucking Chris.

He'll just keep calling
and keep calling, so I'm, uhâ€¦

Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.

Hi. What do you want?

Not far.

Yes.

I don't know. Soon.

[ominous music playing]

[Makani breathing shakily]

Okay.

Bye.

[Makani panting]

He always has to know
where I am all the time.

[sighs]
Did you tell him?

No.

Still thinks he can be my dad, you know?

You never talk about them,

your parents.

What happened?

Sorry.

We canâ€¦ we can just go. [clears throat]

They crashed into a tree.

My dad was driving.

It killed him instantly, and, um,

my mom, she, umâ€¦
she died in the hospital the next day.

I mean, they were drunks, you know?

Always were, but that part gets,
like, left out conveniently.

But it makes for a better legend,
I guess, when it's some

dramatic double suicide
'cause a kid had behavioral issues.

You know, I just think, like,
when something really terrible happens,

people need someone to blame.

No one probably gets that better than you.

I mean, that's what those poems are about,

right?

What?

Being blamed.

Did you do a background check on me?

Makani.

Makani, wait! Stop!

Makani!

Makani Sun-woo.

I know you.

I know who you are.

What are you gonna do? Hitchhike?

Could've told you she was talking

She was a real bitch, that one.

May she rest.

Mmm.

Wasn't too good at hiding it either.

Not like you.

Hmm?

You're a nice girl, aren't you?

Yeah.

It's always nice

No. My parents

I'm gonna get a coffee.

Give you a few.

Okay, bitches. You think
you got what it takes to win State?

'Cause I don't see shit.

[girls continue laughing]

What's your name, bitch?


Hold up. These girls kidnapped you?
These were your friends?

Sometimes friends, I don't know.

They were seniors.
It was my first year on varsity.

Varsity what?
You played sports?


[girls laughing]

Cow!

[gasping, gagging]


<i>Tried to get us to turn on each other.</i>

[girl] You can do better than that!

Hey, Jasmine.

[gasps, screams]

I justâ€¦

Pushed.

Jasmine survived, but there were burns.

Her face was, umâ€¦

I got charged and went to trial.

Even after I was acquitted,
I still got threats

daily.

My parents blamed each other.

for a reason to break up anyway.

I was so ashamed of myself.

So I moved here.

Took my mom's maiden name and justâ€¦

a different person.

You <i>are</i> a different person.

I've never met
the person you're talking about.

You bring me doughnuts
because you know they soothe me.

You proofread my essays.
You stand up for me in public.

That's who you are.

I mean, you gave Ollie Larsson
the benefit of the doubt.

And he's a murderer.

Yeah, you gave a fucking murderer
the chance to show he's decent.

To no more secrets between friends.
[chuckles]

It's a fucking hospital, Zach!
Wait till we get her home!

I'm not saying that we have to smoke it.
Itâ€¦ it's symbolic.

I'm not really good with hugs.

Festival should be a celebration.

People here, they have
a right to feel safe, protected,

but they are sadly undermanned.

That's why

Hospital says he'sâ€¦
he's critical, but he's stable.

I just hope Zach's okay.

Whose farms did his dad buy out?
[Darby] I mean, pretty much everyone's.

Jackson's, Macon's.

Everyone in Osborne
either works for him or hates him.

Don't forget Sheriff Adkins.
What?

Yeah, the sheriff's broke,
had to sell his land.

And now Zach's dad's
trying to replace the cops.

I don't even know where to start. Iâ€¦

I've been so beyond terrible to you.

Guys, what is that?

Shit.

Wait, what's the car got to do with it?

Oh fuck, are you serious?

We have to try to help. Zach and half
of our class are in that maze right now.

Hey! How do we get out of here?

We got you! We got you! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

We got you! Go! Yes, we know! We know! Go!

Okay, go.
Get them out.

No! We're going with you!
No, go!

You gotta help them!

We have to go find Zach.

Go! You know the way out.

Do you know how many times

You only get to kill your dad once!

Jesus.

I had the perfect thing to say

to his face.

What's wrong?

Second-guessing giving me
<i>The Art of War</i> on my ninth birthday?

See? Nowâ€¦ now it just sounds stupid.

He was supposed to be crying andâ€¦

Andâ€¦ and aware of his life choices
and consequences and...

Fuck!

Fuckin' sociopath.

[clicks]
Shit.

No! Oh no!

I am not a sociopath!



Does no one know
what that word means anymore?

If I were a sociopath, I'd have
zero emotional investment in the outcome!

Ollie!

<i>This,</i> this is <i>very</i> important to me.

Andâ€¦ and not to mention
extremely work-intensive.

Do you know how hard it is
to make these <i>fucking</i> masks?

Look, thisâ€¦ this isn't you!

You have no idea who I am!

You don't even know who<i> you</i> are!

I've spent my whole life denying who I am.

I was ashamed, but why?
Because I was born with privilege?

Why should I feel bad about that?

It's not <i>my</i> fault. It's what I was given.

Do you see now?
You're all wearing masks, Makani Sun-woo.

You're all putting on
theseâ€¦ these fake faces.

You're all hypocrites! Just like my dad.

But Iâ€¦ I can't hide
from my dad's last name.

So Iâ€¦ I'mâ€¦ I'm showing
these people who they are!

Who they <i>really </i>are!

Take one more fucking step,
and I swear to God, I will...

What? What?

You'll push <i>me</i> into the fire?

Stab me with the same knife you used
on Caleb? On Jackson and Katie?

The same knife you used
to slit Rodrigo's throat?

<i>You</i> killed my dad.

<i>You</i> killed Ollie.

That's why I had to protect myself

by killing you.


But hey, itâ€¦ it tracks.

More fire, more victims.

So you.

I mean, cops show up.
[gasping]

and they find you dead.

I could just put this all on you.

No one would ever know.

I'll know.


[grunts]
[Makani panting]

You think having everything
makes you the victim?

What kind of fucked-up logic is that?

Blaming everyone else for what's wrong?

When you're what's wrong, Zach.

You're the problem!


Look at me, Zach.

Look at my face!

I don't have to wear a mask
to show you who you are.

[both grunting]


Ollie!

Ollie, no.

"Hey, Ollie."

[siren blaring in distance]

"Hey, Makani."

I'm so sorry.Â I'm so sorry.

Hey, stay with me, Ollie.

Stay with me.

Help is coming, okay?

Stay with me.
