I did it, Jack. I did it.

And you know what?
It got me hot.

No, I'm not kidding.

<i>You should have seen the look</i>
<i>on Carl's face when I buried</i>
<i>that ax in his chest. </i>

Ohh! Killing him was almost
better than sex.

I said almost, didn't I?

Ohhh! We are going
to have so much fun...

spending all of his money,
aren't we, baby?

Oooh! Just thinking
about it gets me all...

hot and squishy.

You mean right now?

<i>He's in the basement</i>
<i>cooling off. </i>

What took you so long?

Jesus, Jack, what kind
of cologne...

Cut!

Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

You call that "hack-ting"?

Well, yes,
I do call it acting.

Well, let me tell you something.
You're no "Gorey" Cooper.

<i>You ain't even</i>
<i>a Robert "Deadford. "</i>

<i>Another take like that</i>
<i>and it'll be back</i>
<i>to bit parts for you. </i>

And I won't say what bits
I'm talking about.

<i>Huh! All right,</i>
<i>everybody. Reset!</i>

Reset, guys.

Director?

Where the hell did
they dig this guy up?

I give and I give and I...
Oh!

Hello, kiddies.
So glad you could join me.

Your old pal the Crypt Keeper
has gone Hollywood in a big way.

Care to see what I've been
working on?

So if you're ready, creeps,
fasten your drool cups...

and hold on to
your vomit bags.

We're going to the movies!

Frights! Camera!
Action!

<i>I call this one... </i>

Come on!

Son of a bitch!

Come on,
you son of a bitch!

Oh, shit!

Damn!

What ya doin', mister?

Are you stealing
my daddy's car?
Stealin'?

No, I was testing the lock.
Seems to be working just fine.

You want a quarter?

How about a shiny new quarter?
You want one?

Dad, there's a guy outside
stealing your car!

<i>Hey, Dad, hurry up. </i>
<i>Get out here!</i>

Homer, go!
He's gone.

Boy, listen
to that thunder.

God's doing some
serious thinking tonight.

I'll bet he's saying,

"On second thought,
maybe I should have given
it all to the monkeys. "

Maybe it's not to late.
I always hate drinking alone.
You want a taste?

Sure.

To the monkeys.

It ain't very subtle,
but it does the trick.

You wouldn't happen to know
of a place where I could
bed down, would you?

Well, it just
so happens, I do.

<i>That's two cars, Sheriff?</i>
That's right, Mavis.

One of 'em's got Maryland
plates, and the other one's
from New Jersey.

Ten-four.
Ten-four.

You were right, Sheriff.

Them sons of bitches must have
been doing well over a hundred.

Well, Bob, it's too late
to give them a ticket.

But, if it'll make you
feel any better, you can
shoot their ashes.

What the...

<i>Holy shit!</i>

Hey, mister,
get away from there.

Where the hell you
come from?
This is my car.

Was my car.
Did you see him?

Walking into town,
the guy I was chasing?

Air bags, gotta love 'em.
Did you see him?

We didn't see anybody.
Now wait a minute.

Are you telling me
that guy over there
walked out of here too?

Where you goin'? You got
a few questions to answer.

Look, Officers, the man
I'm chasing is dangerous.

<i>If he's in your town,</i>
<i>you got a problem. </i>

We stand here arguing
about a traffic accident...
Do you mind?

<i>Something awful's about</i>
<i>to go down... over there. </i>

Is that where we're going?
It looks like a church.

That's it.
Used to be a church.

Ain't a church no more.

They decommissioned it
in the '50s, due to lack
of interest.

Just the place
I've been looking for.

Gangway, I'm bringing
in business.

What kind of business?

I think he's looking for
a room of his own, Cordelia.

<i>You been drinking,</i>
<i>Uncle Willy?</i>

I'm clean as a whistle, Irene.
How long you wanting the room?

I don't know.
One night, maybe two.
Depends.

I never rent short-term,
and I don't rent to strangers.

But I can make exceptions.

<i>Okay. </i>

Enjoy your stay,
Mr...

Mr. Smith.

Jeryline! Jeryline!

Jeryline, I mean now!

I'm trying
to clean your stove.

How do you expect me
to get my work done
if you keep bothering me?

You've been working so hard
with them clean rubber gloves?

Show Mr. Smith
up to number five.

And then fix him some dinner.

And after that, I got
a few more jobs for you.

<i>This time I'm gonna</i>
<i>watch you. </i>

<i>I want it right</i>
<i>the first time, and that's</i>
<i>all there is to it. </i>

<i>It's my way</i>
<i>or the highway. </i>

Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

What do I need to tell you?

What am I looking at?
Which way is town?

Town is that way,
and you're looking at nothing.

But I'm sure you didn't
come here for a view.
But here's your key.

And the concierge will bring up
your bags momentarily.

<i>I don't see how they could</i>
<i>fire you, Wally. </i>

<i>That's what</i>
<i>I told them. </i>

Cordelia, I don't know what
happened to all that mail.

It just disappeared,
but they won't believe me.

God! It's so humiliating.
Do you know what he did?

Uh-uh.
Postmaster comes in...

and he rips my name tag
right off my shirt.

Right in front
of everybody.

And like that's not bad enough,
he took my Mr. Zippy patch.

You should have told your
damn boss to go screw himself.

Stupid post office.
Ain't the only job in town.

The hell it ain't.
If you had any sense, Wally,

you'd crawl back to him
and beg for the job.

Yeah, well,
I already tried that.

He said no.

Oh, poor Wally.

Where is that girl?
Jeryline!

What is it?
Are my sheets done yet?

They're downstairs.
And I couldn't get all those
stains out, either.

Damn guacamole.

Will you put them
on my bed for me?

Why can't you do it yourself?
You know I'm busy.
Get her sheets, will you?

No, I just started that stove.
I can't do everything at once.

I'll get them for you,
Cordelia.

Good. Damn.

That's very sweet of you,
Wally.

Put them on your bed?
Thanks.

Oh, poor guy.

Maybe I should give him
a freebie.

Just what he needs,
someone else screwing him.

To be perfectly honest, I wasn't
watching the speedometer.

Exactly why
were you chasing him?
He's a thief.

What the hell did he steal
that had you going over
100 miles an hour?

Must have been
pretty valuable.

It is.

<i>Sheriff?</i>
Yeah, Mavis, go ahead.

<i>We just got a call from Homer</i>
<i>over at the caf√©. </i>

<i>He says somebody tried</i>
<i>to steal his car. </i>

Okay, we're on it.

You want some?
Hell, no.

I was just thinking how much
better that stuff looked
when it was roadkill.

Why don't you shut up?
You eat it.

She loves me.
You hurry up and finish and...

I'll take care of dessert.

Ah, don't worry.

Good Cleo knows better
than to eat that slop.

Goddamn it! Get that
pussy off the table.

I meant the cat.

Cleo!
Didn't I tell you
to put him out?

I did. I don't know
how she got back in.

<i>You finish cleaning</i>
<i>the stove, or you too busy</i>
<i>shooting the breeze?</i>

For Christ's sake, I'll finish
cleaning it tomorrow.

I want it clean tonight.

<i>Remind me of that program</i>
<i>you're on. It's called</i>
<i>"work release", ain't it?</i>

<i>I swear that girl ain't got</i>
<i>no goddamn gratitude. </i>

If I hadn't made a place
for her, she'd be behind bars
or dead.

Lucky kid.
Mmm.

You expecting somebody,
Mr. Smith?

Evenin', motel people.

<i> You kept</i>
<i>me waiting, Roach. </i>
<i>Ohh. </i>

<i>I'll tell you the reason I'm late. </i>
<i>Somebody tried to steal Homer's car. </i>

You're kiddin'?
That old hunk of junk?
Yeah.

<i>Right out of the diner</i>
<i>parking lot. </i>

Sheriff and Deputy Dipshit
showed up too.

Damn, you look sweet.
Thank you, honey.

<i>You know, I've been looking</i>
<i>forward to this all week. </i>

That makes two of us.
Hey, what are those
panties you got on there?

I got the cherry flavor.

Are those edible panties?

You know I want pieces
of panty in my salad later.

<i>Oh, Roach,</i>
<i>you're so dirty!</i>

Why don't you set the basket
by the steps, Wally.

She's gonna be needing
clean sheets soon enough.

Your boy did the right thing.
You should be...

That about covers it.
We'll let you know
if we hear anything.

<i>Sheriff, you there?</i>

Go ahead, Mavis.

<i>I just got a call from Irene</i>
<i>at the mission about that fellow</i>
<i>you're looking for. </i>

<i>Let's go, Sheriff. </i>
<i>Get in. </i>

He's really holding on tonight,
isn't he?

Okay.

So what were you in for?

I'm not passing judgment.

Stealin'. 'Kay?

Good evening, Irene.
Where is he?
<i>That's him, in the dining room. </i>

Excuse me, mister. We'd like
to have a word with you about
the fender bender on the highway.

Sheriff, you better
watch it. He's armed.

Told you.

Drop the guns,
or I'll kill her.
Don't!

I said, drop your goddamn guns.
He won't do it.

The hell I won't.
I know this man,
and he will not do it.

<i>Drop the knife. </i>
<i>Drop the goddamn knife!</i>

Her blood's on your head,
asshole.

Spread 'em!

<i>Well, well, well. </i>
<i>Mr. Brayker. </i>

Pleased to make
your acquaintance.
You lyin' son of a bitch.

<i>Said his name was Smith. </i>

Call it in, Bob.

I believe you'll find what
I'm looking for in there.

What's he got
to do with this?

I'm... I work
for a collection agency.
It's empty.

Really.
That can't be.

Well, I guess that means
it's somewhere in the house.

Keep him away from me!
Shut up!

Where is it?
I don't know what you're
talking about.

Maybe it's up in his room.
What you guys looking for?

What the hell are we
looking for anyway?
A piece of antiquity.

A relic...
in the shape of a key.

Bob!
Yeah?

<i>Search his room. </i>
It's number five.

<i>Come on, give it to me. </i>
<i>Come on. </i>

<i>Give it to me. </i>
<i>Come on. Ahh!</i>

Come on.
Crank me up.

Come on. Ahh!
God!
Is that good?

Freeze!
Ohh!

Jesus Christ, Bob,
you son of a bitch!

<i>Turn it off!</i>
<i>Turn it off!</i>
I'm sorry.

Oh! My nipples are smoking!

Get your clothes on.
Now!

<i>Good work, Mavis. </i>
Looky, looky.

<i>I didn't find anything</i>
<i>in the perp's room,</i>

but I sure found something
in the room down the hall.

Thanks, Mavis.

Sorry to drag you down here,
but we'll sort this thing out...

and then you can get back
to your business.

I am assuming it was
personal business, Cordelia.

Actually, Sheriff,

it was kind of like
a tune up and lube job.

Shut up, Bob!
I don't want
to hear about it.

You know how it is when you
get your car...
I don't want to hear it.

Shut up, Bob.

This Brayker fella's
getting more interesting.

<i>According to the computer,</i>
<i>Frank Brayker died over</i>
<i>five years ago. </i>

Who the hell are you?

What's your name?

Maybe if you cool your heels
in a jail cell, you'll be
a little more chatty.

Come on, Bob.
Help me get him to the car.

I'd appreciate getting back
what he stole from me.

<i>That way I can</i>
<i>get on my way,</i>

and you can give this lowlife
what he deserves.

Why don't you tell us
where you put it?

<i>You make it easy for me,</i>
<i>I'll make it easy for you. </i>

Mind you, you're off
to a pretty bad start.
I know where it is!

<i>It just occurred to me. </i>
<i>I watched him stash it</i>
<i>and didn't even know it. </i>

Willy, no!
Relax!

I'm sorry, mister.

I'd like you
to put it inside.

Look what he's done.
He's put somethin' awful inside.

<i>Would you mind dumping that out</i>
<i>before you place it inside?</i>

Sure.

No, don't do it.
He's not what he says he is.

He's just...
Just pop that lid.

I'll take that, Willy.

<i>Bob, escort Mr. Brayker,</i>
<i>or whatever his name is,</i>
<i>out to the car. </i>

Sheriff, I am much obliged
for your assistance
in apprehending...

Don't bother.
You're coming with us.

See, both those cars
were stolen.

We're going down to the station
and we're going to sort
this shit out.

Sheriff, you're making
a big mistake.

It won't be for the first time.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

The man said,
if you knew who I was...

We'll find out soon enough.

Why wait?

<i>Give me the keys!</i>

Give me the goddamn keys!

<i>Ah, come on!</i>
<i>Get off me!</i>

Ahhh!

Shit!

Heads up!

Ahhh!

<i>Humans! You're not worth</i>
<i>the flesh you're printed on!</i>

Fuck this cowboy shit!

You fuckin', hodunk Podunk,
well, then, motherfuckers!

All you had to do was give me
the goddamn key!

<i>Then we could get on</i>
<i>with our lives. </i>

All right, this property...

is hereby... condemned.

<i>Shit!</i>

What is that?

Oh, my God!
Shit!

Ahhh!

Oh, great.
What the hell happened
with the lights?

They're gone.

Everybody, back!

Where do you suppose
they went?

What's that smell?

Aaaaah!

Ahhh!

<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

<i>There's more of them!</i>

No, shoot 'em.

<i>Go out the back door. </i>
<i>Come on. Hurry up. </i>
<i>Hurry up. </i>

Oh, that is disgusting.

What the hell is that shit?

Shit!

I don't see them.
Do you see them?
No.

<i>Where the fuck did they go?</i>

Cordelia, stay away
from the door!

You see what I mean?
We can make it to my truck.
No, I don't think so.

Listen! You can stay here
and die if you want to.
I sure as shit ain't.

<i>Roach, be smart for once. </i>
Cordelia!

Roach, wait.
Just come on, would ya?

Ahhhh!

Cordelia, I'm coming!

I'm sorry.

Give me that gun!

Hey, fuck-face!

Get the eyes!
Get the eyes!

Oh, Wally.
Wally. Oh, God.

Need a hand?

Give me the key, Brayker.
For cryin' out loud!

Wally? Wally,
please don't die.

Wally?

Oh!

<i>Cordelia!</i>

<i>Brayker, what the hell</i>
<i>are those things?</i>
<i>Demons or something?</i>

Worse.
Demons. That's sweet.
That's just fuckin' sweet!

And they want to kill us
because of you?

Who's going to protect us?
You?

Deputy Bob?
Or the headless horsemen?
We'll be all right.

Just stay inside and stay
together. We just have
to make it through the night.

And that stuff's
gonna keep them out?

There are only two things
we can use against them.

The blood in this key.
It's blood?

And anything
that destroys their eyes.
Frees their tortured souls.

This is crazy!
Deal with it!

You deal with it.
They got no quarrel with us.

They just want you
and that thing you're carrying.

I say we give it to them.
I say they'll
kill you anyway.

<i>Or possess you. Or use you</i>
<i>to get to the rest of us. </i>

Like it or not,
we stick together.

My cat's outside.
I gotta get my cat.
You go out, you stay out.

Is that so?
What are you gonna do?

<i>Shoot us?</i>
Right in the eyes.

Stay down here.

I'm going to seal
the upstairs.

Damn it!
What are you doing up here?

I thought I told you
to stay downstairs.

Damn!

I thought you might
need help.

Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your cat.

And before, with the knife,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

I knew you weren't.
I just had a feeling
about you.

Can I ask you something?

Who are you?
Really.

I'm just an old man...

running out of time.

Well, well, well.
Isn't this sweet?

Soiled dove and her
square-jawed postal clerk.

You're a bastard.
I ain't the one
who tried to kill you.

Shithead, you left me
out there.

Who in the hell told you
to follow me?

You're absolutely right.
Nobody.

Now I know
who my friends are.

Whores ain't got no friends.

<i>That's all the doors</i>
<i>and window sealed. </i>

Any other ways in or out
of this place?
Aside from doors and windows?

Got some place you
want us to put him?

Jeryline, let's go
make some coffee.

Looks like we're in
for a long night.

Where did you
get that from?
It was my husband's.

Cleo! Hi, baby.

You let the cat in.
She just appeared.

Brayker, what are you doing?

Animals aren't immune.
They can be possessed.

Give me the cat! Shit!

<i>What the hell's going on?</i>
The cat. The cat.

Brayker, my cat is not possessed
by some demon from hell.

We'll see.

Listen, I got
to talk to you.
What?

I got nothing to say.
I just gotta talk to you
for a second.

I don't want to talk. Why don't
you bother somebody else?
Just for a second.

You want to talk?
Let's talk about how you
abandoned Cordelia.

How you left her to die.
Huh?

I hope you're ashamed
of yourself.
Not particularly, no.

Everybody's got
to look out their selves.

I'm for getting out of here.
No one's going anywhere
till Mr. Brayker says so.

Hey, fuck him!
This is his fight.

<i>You may want to die in</i>
<i>this motel, but I don't. </i>

I want to get that key,
and I want to give it
to those things out there.

Hey, Roach.
Haven't you caused
just about enough trouble?

Excuse me. I'm trying
to have a conversation
with my friend, Wally.

He's not your friend.
Assholes don't have friends.

Excuse us.

Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

Jesus, Roach!

So... you got yourself
a new boyfriend.

You get in my way
and I'll kill you.

Keep it in your pants
for a change.

I'm warning you, bitch.

I'm not afraid of you.
No?

You better be afraid
of me.

<i>Come here, girl. </i>
<i>Come on. </i>

<i>Cleo, come on. </i>

Cleo?
Come to mommy.

<i>Come on. </i>
<i>Come here, girl. </i>

Come here, Cleo.
Come on.

<i>I got you, girl. </i>
<i>Come on, Brayker. </i>

See, I told you.
Hey, look...
where she came from.

Breeze.

<i></i>
<i>Poor, Cordelia. </i>

<i>Seems downright criminal</i>
<i>to treat a pretty girl</i>
<i>that way. </i>

<i>Did I say pretty?</i>
<i>I meant beautiful. </i>

<i>'Cause you are. </i>
<i>You are beautiful,</i>
<i>Cordelia. </i>

<i>Inside and out. </i>

<i>Maybe nobody here</i>
<i>can see it,</i>
<i>but I sure can. </i>

<i>I understand you. </i>

<i>I know what you want. </i>

<i>I know what you need. </i>

<i>Guys like Roach,</i>
<i>they think... </i>

<i>just because they're paying</i>
<i>for it that they can</i>
<i>treat you like shit. </i>

If they spend the same money
on dinner and a movie,

they can call you "girlfriend"
instead of "whore. "

<i>Whore, what a horrible word</i>
<i>that is... </i>

to use on someone
who's really just a sad girl
who's looking for love.

<i>Tender, warm,</i>
<i>unconditional love. </i>

I can give you that love,
as much as you can take.

All you have to do
is let me in.

<i>Let me in. </i>

<i>Let me in. </i>

<i>Let me in. </i>

<i>Let me in. </i>

Cordelia?

<i>Cordelia?</i>

Cordelia?
You okay?

Hello, Wally.
Hello, Cordelia.

I realized something awful
about myself tonight, Wally.

My whole life, I've avoided
the guys who really loved me.

Like you.

You really love me,
don't you, Wally?

Yes, Cordelia,
I really love you.

I've always loved you.

From the very first time
I delivered your mail.

Well, don't just do it
with your eyes, Wally.

It's some kind of tunnel.
It's a mine shaft.

Not surprising.
The whole area's
riddled with them.

This means this
is a way out.

We can get to town
before those things
find out we're gone.

No.

No, it's too risky.

What?
Now, listen. What
the hell are you saying?

Trust me.
You're safer in this house.

Shit!

What was that?

What's going on?

Oh, God!
<i>What's in there?</i>

Cordelia?
Ahhhh!

Oh, man!

<i>Shoot it, damn it!</i>
I can't! I can't!

Shoot 'em both!

Stop it, stop it!

Ahhh!

Irene!

Ahhhh!

Ahhhh!

Ohh!

Go ahead.

Give it to me!

Shit!
It's still bleeding.
Here.

We've got to get her outta here.
She'll bleed to death.

We've got to take
our chances in the mines.

The spur that runs under here
comes to a head in a mile.

I say we do it.
Fuck, yeah.

What makes you think
they haven't found the mines?

<i>Has everybody fuckin' had it</i>
<i>with you tellin' us what to do?</i>

<i>If we want to go out to the</i>
<i>mines, we're going out that way. </i>

We don't need
your fuckin' permission.

<i>I got an idea that's gonna</i>
<i>save us that walk. </i>

We give those damn demons
what they want.
Mr. Roach,
