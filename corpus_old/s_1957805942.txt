<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

<i>Okay, and?</i>

<i>And I was hoping

<i>- [SCOFFS] No.
Why?</i>

<i>Because that's what families do

<i>No, that's what they do in the movies.</i>

<i>All facts.</i>

<i>- Especially for you.
[REGGIE CHUCKLES]</i>

<i>Hey, look. I know how you feel.</i>

<i>Whenever my dad asked us to move,

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Next, we'll be strapped down

<i>with big-eyed aliens probing our ass.</i>

<i>- They won't do that to you, Uncle Reggie.
Why not?</i>

<i>'Cause the aliens only want

<i>- Hear what I'm saying?
Ooh! Burn!</i>

<i>You know what? Because you're my nephew,
I'll let that slide.</i>

<i>Bren, he's too smart for his own good.</i>

<i>Talking about how I took her money.
Probably trying to scam me.</i>

<i>[CHUCKLES] I ain't got nothing
for 'em to scam.</i>

<i>[SQUAWKING]</i>

<i>[REGGIE] I mean, think about it,
double-quarter-pound burger.</i>

<i>That's half a pound, right?</i>

<i>How come they ain't got the guts
to call it a half-pounder?</i>

<i>Because it's bad marketing.</i>

<i>[CLICKS TONGUE] No.</i>

<i>[CELLPHONE RINGING]</i>

<i>Oh, this asshole again.</i>

<i>Don't answer it.</i>

<i>- What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.</i>

<i>Uh-uh.</i>

<i>- I know that look, little brother.
What look?</i>

<i>Something's going on with you.
You get twitchy and darty.</i>

<i>- My eyes ain't darty.
You darty right now.</i>

<i>Like when you got a secret
or you about to tell a lie. What's up?</i>

<i>[SIGHS]</i>

<i>Damn.</i>

<i>All right.Â All right.Â All right.</i>

<i>I was going to surprise you
once we got to Houston.</i>

<i>All my life, everybody say
I'm the family fuck-up,Â right?</i>

<i>- No comment.
This time, Reggie ain't the problem.</i>

<i>Reggie's the solution.</i>

<i>[UPTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

<i>Where'd this come from?</i>

<i>The Lord is our savior,
fell out the sky right into our laps.</i>

<i>Peep what's inside.</i>

<i>[EXHALES]</i>

<i>- What the...
The dead dude.</i>

<i>He stashed it under the bathroom sink.</i>

<i>It's gotta be drug money, right?
I figured this dude is deader than shit.</i>

<i>He can't use this money,
but I know a needy family who can.</i>

<i>Have you lost your damn mind?</i>

<i>Bren, the dude was dead.
I mean, like his heart had stopped.</i>

<i>I'm a nurse! I know what a dead dude is.</i>

<i>You thought you were just gonna take this,
and make our lives better?</i>

<i>- This money could save our lives.
It can end our lives!</i>

<i>Bren, just say thank you.
Stop looking on the dark side.</i>

<i>[SCOFFS]</i>

<i>We could turn around
and go back to Los Angeles rightÂ now.</i>

<i>Save the house and everything.</i>

<i>You stole money from a crime scene, Reg.</i>

<i>The voice onÂ the phone,
he killed that man for this money.</i>

<i>And?</i>

<i>And their boss knows we have it.
He knows who we are!</i>

<i>Bren, you overreacting.</i>

<i>He ain't coming back for this.</i>

<i>What if he does? Huh?
You gonna turnÂ into some street gangster?</i>

<i>Instead of the assistant manager
at Chick-fil-A?</i>

<i>Hey, that's an elite position. Okay?
I had to work my way up to that.</i>

<i>You know how many drug tests
I had to pass? That hurt.</i>

<i>- Okay, we gotta call the police.
What?</i>

<i>No. You call the police,
they'll arrest the whole damn family.</i>

<i>They'll say we the ones that murdered him
to rip his shit off.</i>

<i>We are not criminals.</i>

<i>[SCOFFS] We the next best thing.</i>

<i>We Black.</i>

<i>You want to risk the lives
of those twoÂ kids?</i>

<i>[CELLPHONE RINGING]</i>

<i>Here she is.</i>

<i>- Bren, don't answer!
No, Reggie.</i>

<i>- Don't pick it up.
Get... Reggie, get... get off!</i>

<i>[GROANS]</i>

<i>We have your money.
We want to give it back.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>I'm not gonna tell you that.</i>

<i>Worried about your family? You should be.</i>

<i>Look, you'll get your money back,
but it'll be on my terms, okay?</i>

<i>I'll call you back.</i>

<i>I thought about what you said.</i>

<i>You're right.
You have every right to be angry.</i>

<i>Let's just keep half the money.</i>

<i>I was getting some tourist brochures.
Check it out.</i>

<i>We're not tourists.</i>

<i>We're seeing
a whole new part of the country.</i>

<i>Maybe we should take advantage of it.
You know, soak up some culture.</i>

<i>Seriously? This place has culture?</i>

<i>Look, after last night, I just think
we all need to relax and breathe a little.</i>

<i>Feel like normal people again.</i>

<i>Ain't nothing normal about this place.</i>

<i>[REGGIE] Brenda, you my big sister,
I love you.</i>

<i>But you definitely justÂ messed up
the best thingÂ that ever happened to us.</i>

<i>That money would've got rid

<i>All money is not good money, Reg.</i>

<i>Whatever. That's Jake talking.</i>

<i>You damn right that's Jake talking.
You gonna bring up my dead husband?</i>

<i>You know what? Why not?</i>

<i>Jake was a hero, Jake was a god,
'cause Jake always did what was right.</i>

<i>And remind me what good it did Jake</i>

<i>when he needed chemo and radiation,
didn't have the money for it.</i>

<i>I got the money!</i>

<i>You got the money by getting yourself
so far in debt you lost your house.</i>

<i>Let your own kids down!</i>

<i>- You a asshole, you know that?
Yeah, I know it.</i>

<i>I've known it my whole life.</i>

<i>'Cause people constantly reminding me.</i>

<i>You know what? Maybe I am
just an assistant manager at Chick-fil-A.</i>

<i>That don't mean
I don't have my ownÂ dreams too.</i>

<i>You killed those dreams.</i>

<i>I was just trying to make things better.</i>

<i>That's all I was doing.</i>

<i>[KIDS CHATTERING]</i>

<i>Please, for the love of God,

<i>You have two hours to retrieve my money.</i>

<i>Then bring it back

<i>Or your son is dead.</i>

<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

<i>- Cam?
Swear to God, if he hurts that boy...</i>

<i>I gotta get back to that motel

<i>Begging your pardon.</i>

<i>Would you be the Freemans?</i>

<i>Captain Hammers

<i>I'm looking into the homicide</i>

<i>that took place last night
at the Sunset Motel.</i>

<i>I didn't spot y'all atÂ Old Bravo

<i>There's no place else to eat for miles.</i>

<i>- Sir, we already talked to the police.
I know.</i>

<i>Mind if I join you?</i>

<i>Darling, bring me a big old glass
of iced tea, extra sweet, lots of ice.</i>

<i>- Thanks.
Sure, Captain.</i>

<i>And, uh...</i>

<i>you'd be Kelly.</i>

<i>And you'd be the uncle.</i>

<i>Reginald Beaumont.</i>

<i>Hmm. Which accounts for two of you.</i>

<i>Now, as to your mom and brother,</i>

<i>your mom was last seen driving
south ofÂ here like a bat out of hell.</i>

<i>Where's your brother Cam?</i>

<i>Um, he was with her, sir.</i>

<i>Probably didn't see him
because he'sÂ little for his age.</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>- [WAITRESS] Super sweet.
Thank you.</i>

<i>Now, how about we cut the bullshit?</i>

<i>There's a fortune in missing drug money.</i>

<i>And if your mom's got it,
she's in a whole world of danger.</i>

<i>Because it either belongs
to the Sinaloa Cartel,</i>

<i>or a Mr. Cross,</i>

<i>a man who's the most dangerous criminal
in the Southwest.</i>

<i>He's murdered at least 50 people.</i>

<i>You want to see
your mom and brother alive again?</i>

<i>You need to tell me where they are.</i>

<i>Or don't.</i>

<i>It's their funeral.</i>

<i>[BREATHES DEEPLY] Reggie.</i>

<i>Sir! Sir, wait.</i>

<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

<i>SUV's been trailing us

<i>I slow down, he slows down.</i>

<i>I speed up, he speeds up.</i>

<i>You think it's Mr. Cross?</i>

<i>I don't think
he'd get his hands dirty like this.</i>

<i>Might be one of his goons.</i>

<i>Let's not take any chances.</i>

<i>But I'm gonna ask you both

<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>Mace, bitch shot off my leg!</i>

<i>I missed! I was aiming for your balls.</i>

<i>I got one more shot in this gun.
Who wants it?</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>You can't shoot us all.</i>

<i>I won't have to.</i>

<i>The money in that bag
belongs to Mr. Cross.</i>

<i>You heard of him?</i>

<i>I wonder what he would do

<i>Put the fucking money back in the bag.</i>

<i>Go on, do it.</i>

<i>You have had one hell of a 24 hours, JD.</i>

<i>I underestimatedÂ Harvey Ruck.</i>

<i>Son of a bitch was feeling brave.</i>

<i>I had no other choice.</i>

<i>Problem was, I had to clear out

Throw up your dukes â™ª</i>

Break out your coop and grip your wood â™ª</i>

Light your spliff and blow your... â™ª</i>

Exactly like a player should â™ª</i>

Do your thing and rep your hood â™ª</i>
