C'mon boys we ain't got all day.

Hey baby doll!

Baby doll!

Now what's next?

Sweet Carl's.

Ten dollars.

Ten bucks?

Loan delinquent, two weeks.

Break... fingers.

This has gotta be a mistake!

Maybe a couple of zeros
missing or something.

I mean break fingers!
For ten bucks?

I don't see what you're
so upset about, George

I mean it ain't like we
get to keep the money.

So, what's the difference if
it's ten dollars or million?

The idea is to work ourselves
up into the organization not down.

How we gonna it by
collecting milk money?

I guess...

What's next?

Pickup Mr. Aorta's
underwear at the cleaner's.

What the fuck!

Just kidding, George.

Hey! George...

What can I do you for?

A manicure... what can you do
me for? You know what we want.

No... not really.

Let me refresh your memory.

On October 14th you borrowed
money from Mr. Aorta.

I did?

No, he did. Yea, you did!

Mmm, October 14th...
October... 14th.

The date rings a bell... Oh yea!

Yea, I, my old ladies birthday.

I borrowed ten bucks
to take her out to dinner.

Hold on.

Ok...

Here. Here's four

I'll get you the rest on Friday.

No, you're past overdue.

Break his fingers.

Hey... hey!

You're gonna break my
fingers for a ten dollar loan?

You gotta be kidding...

What do I look like a
"Borges belle comedian?"

Wait! George! I've...
taken you fishing!

I gave you lobsters!

It was a very good
lobster, George.

Yea! I can't mend nets
with busted fingers.

You bust 'em my
family don't eat.

For God sake, it was
only ten bucks!

Alright, alright.

Aww, thanks!

You're a true friend.

Ow! God, you broke
my fucking nose!

George...

Well now he can fix his nets!

George! Dip!

Hi, Ruffo.

DeMarco, he's dead.

What you talking about?

He died about an hour ago.
In some kind of accident.

Poor DeMarco.

Why you smiling?

Why am I smiling?

Because I just got my acceptance
letter to medical school.

Dip...

DeMarco's dead.

I know he's dead.

I just don't know why
that would make you smile.

First, he was an asshole,
so he should rot in hell.

Second, he was conciliary
to Aorta for you non Italians.

He's number two on
the totem pole.

So...

Don't you get it?

It's my turn at bat!

My turn to move up.

What's so funny?

"Concigliary" Gianfranco...

Yea...

Come on George...

Think of all the
guys ahead of you.

Glasso, Madariaga, Revell...

Well those guys
are pieces of shit.

And I'd stop laughing if I were you,
McKenzie, before I bust your Irish ass!

I'm better than those jerks.

I deserve the job.

I know that George.

No disagreement here.

Well then let's go celebrate.

Beat it beefcake!

Ay, look.

It's my cheapest,
rudest, customer.

Ah gee, Carol, why do you
always have to be so vague?

Get off it, Jorge.

You're the only jerk I know who
tries to pay me in installments.

Like I'm a toaster
oven from Hershman's.

You know we love to chat
with you but Dip and I...

We don't come here
for conversation.

Sorry, Jorge, I don't accept
your checks no more.

I got cold cash!

Ok.

But I go with, Dip.

You can have my beautiful
new partner, Glorice.

Just arrived on the dock.

C'mon, Dip.

No, no, no.

I ain't getting stuck with your
so-called beauties anymore.

What are you talking about?

Does the name Henrietta Harry
Hopkins mean anything to you?

Or Teresa Two-Ton Tompkins?

Relax, Jorge.

This Glorice, she's
a looker Papi.

No... I ain't buying.

Dip my boy... your turn
to fall on the grenade.

Glorice!

We got customers.

I'd like to introduce
you to Dip.

Hi.

Dip's with chicka.

My name's George.

George.

What baby?

We can't. We can't.

Well there are certain female
functions which occur once a month.

I coulda had Chicka,
why didn't you tell me?

I don't believe it.

For one I thought I
thought you were cute.

Cute!

A bunny rabbit's cute.

George Giafranco...

Is good looking.

And two, I thought I could
please you in other ways.

Like what?

I'm sure you all know
why I called this meeting.

Earlier today

an accident down at the docks
involving a crate filled with tuna fish

resulted in the death
of Richie DeMarco.

Conciliary DeMarco
was a brutal man,

who killed without conscience.

A man who never once felt
sympathy for those he terrorized.

In fact... he was
never happy unless

another human being
somewhere in this world

was suffering.

It was because of these
endearing qualities

that conciliary DeMarco
will be missed by us all.

A moment of silence, please.

Ok, now on to some
weekly business matters.

Happy birthday Mr. Aorta!

For he's a jolly good fellow,

for he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow

which no body can deny.

Count 'em boys
they're all there.

For once I wish you boys
would have shortchanged me.

Oh course we've got
some presents for ya.

Ah guys, you shouldn't have,

but since you already bought
them I might as well open them.

Why didn't you tell
me it was his birthday?

I'm sorry George,
I completely forgot.

It's a .45 silver plated.

Custom made.

Nice...

Very nice.

You two don't have a present?

Is that something you
deduced all by yourself?

Good luck getting
the new position.

Personalized brass
knuckles, Boss.

I had your name
inscribed backwards,

so you could leave your
name on your victim's face.

Very thoughtful, Ruffo.

Well Boss since
you're a special guy.

Dip and I got you a special
gift, very special.

And uh, it's not here
now but uh it's a date.

I think you're gonna like it.

Trust me.

What's her name?

It's uh... Glorice.

Good day ladies!

Listen cheapskate, nobody shortchanges
my friend after she wets his wick.

What the hell are you talking
about? >> It's ok Chicka, let him go.

The money you paid me
was counterfeit, George.

It was? Really?
Awe, I'm sorry I didn't know.

Here.

Hey, hey, I got it at the bank
this morning, it's good.

I sweat to God.

Something gives me the
feeling you're not just here to chat.

Glorice... uh...

We was wondering if you could
perform your oral specialty.

On which one of you?

No, no, it's not for us.
It's for our boss, Mr. Aorta.

It's his birthday.

That's Joey "The Heart"
Aorta! The mob boss?

He runs this town... forget it
Glorice! The man's a murderer.

Let me get this straight,
you want a blowjob certificate?

Yea.

$50 dollars up front
and no funny money.

$50 bucks for a lousy hummer?

Too much!

It's high... but if you
went to the trouble

of finding me you
must really need me.

$30.

Alright, $50,

but you better be sucking
harder than Dorothy's tornado.

Where the hell is this broad of
yours? >> Oh she'll be here soon.

Boss... you're gonna love her.

Gianfranco,
how could I possibly love her

when I've never even seen her?

I just know.

Georgie, things going good?

Things going good?

Glorice ain't here and Aorta's
holding me responsible,

things couldn't be worse!

Hey! Hey!

Chow mein!

What are you doing!

Believe it or not wop
asshole, it's called cooking.

No, no, no, this is a Sicilian
restaurant we don't want fried rat.

Hey let go!

I'm the cook. >> Says who?

Says Mr. Lucizzi.

Mr. Lucizzi hired me
because I'm a good cook.

I work hard for the money.
Sicilian food...

So you leave me alone.
Don't call me names.

I'm gonna make your boss the
best Sicilian food he ever had.

Alright, that must be her.
I guess we're stuck with you

well make it good.
And no sweet and sour spaghetti.

Please!

You real funny man!

Yea... I'm a fucking
joke a minute.

Glorice is here.

You're late!

Um... she had a problem
with the taxi, Boss.

Gianfranco, let the broad
make up her own damn excuses.

First of all I'm a
woman not a broad.

And second I would
hardly call 45 extra

minutes for a woman to
make an arrival, late.

How's things going
out there, George?

Terrible, they haven't said
a kind word to each other.

Food's ready.

This better be good. Or I'm
gonna kill your entire family.

I have feeling you
very unhappy child.

The cook...

Yea? >> What part
of Sicily is he from?

The East. The far east.

I could tell.

The man has talent.

We'll let him know Mr. Aorta.

Hey you.
Give me some of that bread.

The name's Glorice,
not "Hey you."

Gianfranco...

The wine, the food, the
place, first rate.

But the broad...

You know Mr. Aorta,

I know who you are and what you
do but I'm not afraid of you.

Do not call me a broad!

I'm the man here!

I make the rules.

And I'll call you anything I
want. Broad!

And I wanna talk to you...
and to you!

You're the first
woman to stand up to me.

Me... I like that.

Incredible.

I almost couldn't believe
it neither, George.

I think he really likes her.

Ben, you mick bastard...
two more.

Hey.

Two more it'll be.

Thank you, Ben.

Oh, Georgie...

There a problem?

George Gianfranco
with a problem?

You are looking at the man who set
up the boss with a number one broad.

Glorice.

Cheers.

Conciliary...

Conciliary.

Conciliary...

The first thing... the first
thing I'm gonna do is.

I'm gonna buy some
new "minolian."

And then I'm gonna get...
George, look who.

It's the bosses girlfriend.

Why don't we invite
her to join us for a drink.

Is it really such a big deal?

What are you talking about?

Why don't we just
tell Mr. Aorta?

I know he seems tough.

But I think deep down he's
an understanding kind of guy.

You're kidding.

Maybe honesty is the
best policy here George.

Mr. Aorta...

We cannot tell a lie...

We accidentally set you up with a
man dressed in women's clothes.

You know, a he-she.

No problem!

Forget about it...

Yea sure. Why not?

I mean the guy's got
a sense of humor.

It'll all end up
as a great joke.

Something we can
all laugh about.

I can't believe it.

I have found the missing link.

What?

What are you saying?

What am I saying?

You are the missing link.

I mean no primate can talk,
no human being can be so naive.

You wanna hear about
Mr. Aorta's sense of humor?

He's giving us some
shoes two sizes too

big to see which one
of us sinks fastest.

That ain't so funny.

Just a second.

George, Dip, come on in.

Um... we wanna talk to
you Glorice about Mr. Aorta.

Right, in fact I'd like to
thank you boys for

introducing me to
your generous friend.

Actually we don't think you
should be going out with him again.

I'll uh... just let
me put it this way...

We don't think you're uh
woman enough for him.

I was woman enough
for you wasn't I, George?

You ain't gonna
get your $50 bucks.

What $50 bucks?

You know the 50 bucks we was

gonna give you for
going out with him again.

What's so funny?

Look Dip, Joey sent it
over to me this morning.

Must be worth over 1000 bucks.

I'm gonna milk your mob
boss for everything he's worth.

Bye boys.

When Ipsum wrote an
"Enemy of the People" he

intended for Doctor Stockman...
you

to represent individualism
and virility.

Uh excuse me Mr. Kirk but
ain't this Doctor Stockman a man?

My dear...

In Shakespearean times the
female roles were played by men

eliminating the jobs of
thousands of actresses.

Well I'm trying to right
a wrong by giving

you actresses the
chance to play all the roles!

Understand? >> I guess.

Well now, try it
again but with feeling.

The strongest man in the
world is he who stands most alone.

Good enough.

Now give those customers a show!

Well now come on then gentleman,
make yourself at home.

Sit down there.

Little nectar...

For the soul.

There we go!

Cheers!

Cheers. >> Cheers.

We got a problem.

Ah, Gregory Kirk,
problem solver.

We set our boss up with some
broad we don't think she's right.

I take it your boss is
a man of some power?

Yea. >> Yea.

You see we don't know
so many women but

seeing as how you run this strip
joint we thought maybe you could...

My dear boy Theatrum
Amitorius is a reperatory theater which

does erotic adaptions of the
classics... Not a strip joint!

Yea but that woman was naked.

Dip sees tits and
he thinks stripper.

You need to use your reasoning
and intellect not your base instincts.

Don't worry there's
hope for you yet.

We wanna set up our
boss with some actresses.

We have talented thespians
from a variety of backgrounds...

You wouldn't imagine the competition
necessary to become a classical actress.

Tremendous competition.

Yea it must be rough.

Excuse me Mr. Kirk?
Yes, Captain Horster?

What's a fuhjord?

Oh...

That's a fjord my dear.

What ever.

But I like Glorice.

If you like Glorice you're
gonna love these women.

And they're beautiful.
Right, Dip?

Not interested.

One's got legs... to there.

I don't think so.

Boss, these women are nice,
some of them they even tell jokes.

A man and a duck
they walk into...

And one's got the
perfect shaped jugs...

They defy gravity...

And a rear end like a
piece of ripe fruit.

And Dip, Dip! What's the
name of the one who

vacuums in the nude?

Then again, Glorice and I
ain't exactly married, right?

Well you two just wasted
about two hours of my time.

Now if you'll excuse me
I've got a date with Glorice.

Boss...

What was wrong with them?

I can't say exactly,

but Glorice has got something
these other women don't.

I got it... balls.

Glorice got balls.

Here you go boys, bon apetite.

Thank you, Maria.

What are you doing?

I'm trying to figure out a
solution to our problem.

No, no I mean right now.

I'm drinking a chocolate
milkshake so fucking what!

Maybe we should say you're
trying to drink a chocolate milkshake?

Cause you ain't able to.

Look, George.

I know this may not be the right
time to bring this up but I

gotta idea that could make
us a million bucks easy.

You know in case this
mob thing don't workout.

What is it?

Why couldn't you drink
your milkshake just now?

It's too thick, I don't know.

Or the straw is too thin, yea?

What are you saying?

Your standard straw is only
one eighth of an inch in diameter.

So.

So. It is designed for a milk or a
lemonade or a soda not a milkshake.

Are you gonna give me this
million dollar idea before I die of old age?

Wide straws.

Designed especially
for thick milkshakes.

And get this, the best part...
guess what I call it?

I give up.

The "shrtaw."

The "shtraw?"

Yea, yea you know,
like a shake and a straw.

Together.

So what do you think?

Dip...

There's one thing you didn't
think of. And it's called...

The spoon.

When it's too hard to
suck people use a spoon.

Oh yea?

So how come you didn't
use a spoon just now?

Maybe it's because
he enjoys sucking.

Hey you better back
off before I crown you.

What is it they say? We often
hurt those who we love the most.

No actually what they say is
we often kill those we hate the most.

Oh I love it when you get
mad. Kinda gets me hot.

Boy you're really disgusting.

I don't think my little Joey
would appreciate you talking to

his girlfriend in
that demeaning tone.

Girlfriend?

Since when are you
his girlfriend?

Since he told me last night.

Bye boys.

Why didn't you tell me!

But it ain't true!

I tell you the short position
got no room for fruits like you.

This here's Brooklyn.
Listen to me, it ain't true!

Now get out of here before I kill
you. Don't even think on coming back.

Boss, please, no!
Son of a bitch.

Are you ok, Ruffo?

Yea.

Gianfranco, Dip, get in here!

With Ruffo it was obvious
things weren't exactly kosher.

If you get my drift.

He lacks the kind of desire for
women's flesh that most of

us would consider to be natural.

Boss. How'd you know that
things were un-kosher with Ruffo?

We went out to get
some drinks at Alfie's...

Ruffo ordered something
called the Pink Panties.

And when the waitress brings it, it's
got this little umbrella sticking out of it.

An umbrella?

Yea... one of those
little paper ones.

But what's worse is, Ruffo
doesn't even take it out of his drink.

That's all he did?
That's all he had to do!

Cause if anyone could
tell you who's a softy,

if you get my drift,
it's Joe Aorta.

So...

You boys got this week's
protection money?

Thanks.

Hey!

And I wanna talk to you about
introducing me to Glorice.

I saw her last night...

And she's quite a woman.

And notice please how I do
not refer to someone as

special as Glorice as a broad.

I've dated quite a few broads in
my time. But now

I've finally met a woman.

And I owe it all
to you Gianfranco.

No, no, no you don't
owe me anything Boss.

You would have met her in
Brooklyn bowling or something.

Bullshit. If it wasn't for you.

I would have never met her.
George, stand up.

I said stand up! >> Right.

Gianfranco, this is for setting
me up with such an incredible woman.

Now be in my office tomorrow at
noon. For a special surprise.

You wanna bite?

Hey George. Something wrong?

My life is gonna
end tomorrow at noon.

I think that qualifies
as something wrong.

What are you talking about?

Aorta gave me the kiss of death.

That wasn't the kiss of
death. That was the kiss of thanks.

That's the way you Italians are
you're always kissing each other.

I've been around long enough
to know the kiss of death.

It all adds up, Aorta
goes out with her...

Tries to go to third base reaches
down, comes up with a frankfurter.

I think you're getting little
paranoid here Georgie.

Easy for you to be casual...

You weren't asked to go to
Aorta's office tomorrow at noon.

Remember when the boss
kissed you last Easter?

Yea.

So how come you didn't cry
out then about the kiss of death?

Last Easter he didn't have
a reason to have me iced.

Now he does.

Gianfranco, glad you made it.

I want you to meet Micky.

Hey George, nice to meet you.

Micky's here as a sort
of a temporary helper.

Oh yea?

How you gonna be with us?

I should be done
in 15 minutes of so.

Micky!

As long as it takes for
you to finish the job.

I don't like to brag but
I can work pretty fast.

Enough girl talk... Micky...

Surprise!

Congratulations
to my conciliary.

You bought it hook
line and sinker.

And to think
Micky's only a baker.

Hey George I'm sorry
if I scared you.

You got me.

I think the desk is
better over by the door.

Why?

Well you'll get more fresh
air coming in through the hallway,

it's something to think
about in case of a heat wave.

Yea but if I'm by the door people
might think I'm Mr. Aorta's secretary.

But you are... >> Conciliary!

Which means?

Which means I'm Mr.
Aorta's personal advisor.

His confidante,
his problem solver.

I make sure everything
goes smoothly.

Sounds like a secretary to me.

Only broads are secretaries!
I'm a conciliary! There's a difference!

I see.

Now if you don't mind,
I got work to do.

Nice tush.

Hey, get the fuck out of here!

George, I don't know
what you're so angry about.

I mean you get the job of
your dreams plus you have a

fabulous time with me which must
be like icing on the cake.

I did not, I repeat.

I did not have a good time.

So you were faking it,
but you seemed so convincing.

Especially the end.

Coffee? >> Please.

I need a shrink.

Breath in.

Breath out.

Hey Doc... if it ain't
beating don't let me know.

I don't like bad news.

Breath. Again.

Have you been smart lately?

My friend here just set me
up with a sweet little dame.

I got a reason to live now.

I ain't lit up for four weeks.

Mr. Aorta, your heart
is better, slightly better.

Keep taking the medication,
stay off those

stogies and avoid too
much excitement.

Hey Doc. Maybe I
should take up knitting.

Fine, Mr. Aorta.

George, I was serious what
I said to him about Glorice.

I really like her.

No she's a beautiful woman.

Tonight...

Tonight?

Tonight...

What do you mean Boss?

You know, the
birds and the bees.

Are you sure about that?

Yea. I mean I love her.

That's for sure.

Well then maybe you should
wait, you know, not for nothing.

Women you like you sleep with, a
woman you love, waiting it better.

I know... but I can't help it!

I'm impatient.

What about what the church says?

The church?

Gianfranco, you think it makes a
difference to the guy upstairs?

I've already broken every
commandment there is.

I don't think one small indiscretion is
gonna make one whole hell of a difference.

Do you?

Well what about what the Doc says?
You know not too much excitement...

Gianfranco, is there
something wrong with her?

No... I just want this to
work out for you two.

Oh ok.

You know my father
Joe "The Boss" used to say...

There's only two things you say to a
woman, get over here, and get out of here.

Well, get over here.

Oh Joe you're such an animal.

Oops.

Hey Boss, Marciano's
fighting at The Garden

you wanna take Glorice
to see the fight?

Gianfranco, can't
you see we're busy?

If I want the sports
calendar I'll read the paper.

Just checking.

Hey Boss. >> Now what is it?

You want me to drive so
you can take Glorice to dinner?

That's it, Gianfranco, out of
the car! I wanna talk to you.

Gianfranco, what is it with you?

What do you mean?
What do I mean?

You keep interrupting us every 10
seconds. I thought you were a friend here.

I am but I've never been conciliary,
I wanna make sure things go right.

You ever consider that shutting up
might be what I need from a conciliary!

Hey look, I'm sorry, don't
worry about it, I know you're

trying you're best, maybe
you should just wait out here

and things will work out better.

Besides...

It's a little tough getting it
up with another guy around.

You know?

Where were we?

What's wrong!

Well Joey, it's a female thing.

Oh... I get it.

I'm sorry, it's not your fault.

I guess.

Just bad timing.

But maybe there is
something I can do.

Gianfranco, guess what?

I don't know.

Glorice and I we're getting
married!

You sure about this?

After Rita, God rest her soul
I didn't think I could do it again,

but Glorice...

She makes me feel like a kid.
I see things in color now.

The green trees, the smell
of the air, can you smell it?

Yea.

C'mon, really smell it with
me! Breath in, breath out.

Breath in, breath out.

I think I'm ready for more.

Where were we?

I'm gonna miss you.

Oh Joey, you're only
gonna be gone an hour.

45 minutes.
But it's still too long.

My sweet little cannoli.

Gianfranco, I'll be back soon.

Boss.

I was talking to Glorice.

Why do I get the feeling... you're
gonna tell me you're in love now?

I can't believe it, you
still haven't figured it out?

I think I overestimated
you George.

As soon as I become Mrs. Joey "The Heart"
Aorta I'm going to blackmail your boss.

And what do you think Mr.
Aorta is gonna do when he

finds out you're
blackmailing him?

He's going to p. A. y.

Babycakes, no he's not.
He's going to k. I. L. l.

No... because if he tries any
funny stuff everything will

go straight to the
Brooklyn newspapers.

You see I've worked out
this little system with safety

deposit boxes and friendly
reporters, smart huh?

And what about me?

I mean what happens
to me after the wedding?

After you so cleverly
blackmail Mr. Aorta.

Well George, to be quite honest I
haven't really thought about that one.

Attractive lady.

It's gotta get done in 48
hours. >> Yea, Mr. Briles by Friday.

It ain't hard, you just
line her up and kill her.

It ain't what?

It ain't hard, it
ain't not too hard. Yea.

What I do ain't easy.

It's an art.

And it can't be rushed.

Think Michelangelo had to punch a
clock when he painted the Sistine Chapel?

Just make sure she ain't
breathing when it's done.

There's more to it than that.

What happens if a
witness recognizes me?

And alibi's, I provide
an alibi for each one of

my customers in case
something goes down.

I never thought of
that stuff before Georgie.

And it's always something
different, another challenge.

You heard of Chaulky Brigamo?

You whacked Chaulky Brigamo?

The guy was guarded around
the clock, never alone.

Except for every day at noon
when he used the time to

catch up on the sports
page in piece and quiet.

While sitting on his throne.

Cause he thought
it was safe there.

After two weeks of research
I designed a bullet that

bounces off lead pipes
but penetrates human flesh.

And that was the end
of Chaulky Brigamo.

Incredible.

Really incredible.

His wife and kids
didn't think so.

But hey... that's his problem.

Get that fucking
thing outta here.

But George... give it a try.

It works. >> Now!

Are you sure that...
a hitman is really necessary?

Dip, we went over this. Now
I don't like killing neither.

It's Glorice's fault, I mean
she's making it necessary.

That's not what I meant.

I've been thinking about
our problem here.

And it's based on the theory
that Aorta would flip out if he

found out that Glorice was
a man... but consider this

maybe Aorta knows.

Are you implying that Joey "The
Heart" Aorta prefers men over broads?

Something to think about.
You're gone!

He's the straightest man I know.

Well show me proof.
He was married!

Yea, yea for like a year
or something, big deal.

The man's a complete
womanizer! >> Yea so we heard.

But have you ever
seen him with a woman?

A million times!

Um, two months ago when uh... that
Las Vegas show girl was visiting Brooklyn.

Ah man that Vegas show girl
she was a gift from Stumpy La Tierra.

And the boss gave her to
Revella who did her himself.

A broad can get laid by
more than one guy.

Yea well how about Annie LeDoux?
You remember her?

Annie LeDoux... had a
serious case of The Clap, you

know a smart man Confucius say,
'Don't put nose where it don't belong.'

George, will you
listen to yourself.

You're using a fortune cookie to
defend the boss's manliness.

Look, I know what I know. And
The Boss is a straight shooter.

Yea but maybe there's
something there.

Deep down, you know
something waiting to surface.

And one day, he changes.

He ain't gonna change...

And that's the way it
is, no more to say!

You worry too much.

Well I wouldn't
worry if the wedding

was next month or next
week but it's tomorrow.

There's still time. Frank
Briles always completes the job.

Understand? >> Oh... oh, oh...

Mr... Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Artiste,
Mr. Pablo Picasso with a hitman.

I should have known. >> Hey.

Do you know what my
kill percentage is?

What do I look like?
A statistician?

100% 47 contracts, 47 kills.

It don't get any better than
that. >> It couldn't.

I don't think...

Right, Dip.

I have a perfect record.

No arithmetic here,
that shit's in the past.

In every case I've ever taken
there always comes a break.

Take the example of Robby Castellano
the most paranoid gangster of all times.

I mean this guy was just
waiting to get whacked.

Kept a piece under his pillow...
that was the opening I needed.

I snuck into his house stole the
gun, made a small adjustment...

That night I just
tapped on the window

and let that fat fuck's
paranoia take over.

Don't worry George, I guarantee
you the job will be done.

We've got pastrami,
salami, turkey, beef tongue,

chicken salad, chicken liver,
chopped chicken

Sam, just give us the best.

And make sure there's
enough for everybody.

Oh I can do something spectacular
but it may cost you a pretty penny.

Ain't nothing too expensive
for Glorice's wedding honey.

She's going to be the most
beautiful bride in the whole world.

Like a modern day Helen of Troy.

Hey, I got your information
right here, how about I have

one of my workers deliver a
complete meal over to your

place... salad, main course,
the whole works, tonight?

About six

I'll be looking forward to it.

How you doing
this wonderful day!

Roast beef on rye.

Make it bloody.

George... I caught a break.

And?

Six o'clock tonight your
problem will be solved.

I hope so. I'm getting
tired of this fucking sauna.

Let me get that for you.

Thank you.

I wanna congratulate you
on your win tomorrow.

You are coming aren't you?

Oh I wouldn't miss it for the
world. I'm the best man.

Is something wrong?
Why you asking?

Well you're smiling.

George is so bad he smiles
when there's something wrong?

I have an idea.

The good stuff.

A toast.

To what?

To uh... your wedding

to my promotion...

To us.

George, why aren't
you being a jerk?

That was the old
negative George,

now I know everything
works out in the end.

What's meant to be
is meant to be.

That's beautiful.

Salud.

Who is it?
Delivery from Friendly Sam's.

Oh just a second.

Thank you for coming. Yes, mam.

There you go. >> Thank you,
would you sign here please?

Do I know you from somewhere?
Uh, I don't think so.

Uh, put the date
in there please.

I know, I know you.
Maybe from the deli.

No not that. You
seem so familiar.

I got it!

Frank's the name,
but I don't have any nieces.

Oh well I used to
be one of your nephews.

It's me Gary, Gary Calshime.

I don't buy it lady. Googoo.

Excuse me?
You used to call me Googoo.

You took me to the Dodger
games, you taught me.

"Take me out to the ball game,
take me out to the park."

Googoo!

It is you!

Oh! Oh! Here he is!

The hired help. The
contract killer.

Grim Reaper. >> Michelangelo
of the murderers.

George, I gotta talk to you.

Have some bubbly.
George, listen to me.

You're going to relax!
George, there was a problem!

Who is painful?

Let's say I'm only 98% effective
now but there's a good side to this.

I got what you call...
a money back guarantee.

George, take it easy.

George, somebody could get
hurt. >> I'll kill you!

But I don't fuck up!

Fucker.

Mr. George Gianfranco,
put your hands in the air!

Now take a step forward, slowly!

Now tough guy!

Ooh, my balls!

My balls!

You should have thought
of your fucking balls

before you put your piece
in the back of my head.

Don't shoot, don't shoot!

Don't shoot, don't shoot? Why?
You gonna take my birthday away?

You'll go straight to
the chair in Sing Sing.

For what?

Hey, hey I don't mean to hurry
you but I got a wedding to go to.

Sgt. Mark Ellesberry,
draft detective.

United States Navy. You shoot a federal
agent and you'll get the chair for sure.

What do you want from me?

George Gianfranco, Brooklyn,

wanted for evading service
with the United States Navy.

Hey I went for my physical two
years ago and I was classified 4F.

For what!

Flat feet.

What?

Flat feet!

Well!

I don't believe it, you wanna see
'em? >> Draft dodging is a serious crime!

Alright already.

Oh... oh, ok.

Well it ain't a
flower it's a flat foot!

Alright, put 'em away!

Ok. Ok.

Right, sir. Well I think we can
straighten this whole thing out.

You better.

Gun, please.

Oh, uh, one more thing.
I need to know if you recognize

any more of the
suspects in my book.

Hey, do I look
like a rat to you?

You know we might
have to go before

the judge to straighten
this whole thing out.

Alright, I got you. Alright.

No.

No.

No.

No.

N...

What's the rap?

Good luck Mr. Aorta!

The recipe... for all great
marriages is the same.

It contains two very
special ingredients.

A man and a woman.

Those two ingredients are
necessary for the recipe to work!

Without them you don't
have anything at all!

Now.. Today.

I will be the cook for
the recipe of Aorta pie.

I offer those those uh... of you
who don't understand my metaphor.

I will officiate the marriage
of Joseph Carlo Aorta,

and Glorice Pearl...
uh... Coushime.

Now, let's all rise... and
welcome the beautiful bride.

Mr. Joseph Aorta?

Ladies and gentleman,
Glorice and I would

like to thank everybody
for coming today...

Glorice had a family
emergency so the

marriage will not be
performed at this time.

We will however be rescheduling
the wedding in the near future.

Sorry.

Thanks for coming.

I don't know... maybe her
mother passed away or something.

Things happen.

Yea, what's the point?

You might as well
know the truth.

Boss?

Dear Joey, I'm afraid I cannot marry
you because I have found another man.

I'm leaving Brooklyn
forever, Glorice.

G... B... A... G... L...

Wait, what's GBAGL?

It's goodbye and good luck.

You know she probably didn't
have enough money for the

telegram so she shortened
the ending. You know?

Who do you think the guy is?

It's not important.

What's important is... is you
go on, you find another woman.

Hey... you deserve better.

C'mere.

You're a true friend Gianfranco.

I gotta tell you Dip, I used
to think happy endings was

just for the pictures
not for real life.

I guess things worked
out ok, huh Georgie boy?

Ok? Try fantastic.

I'm gonna be conciliary of
Brooklyn, you'll be my assistant

by next week and due to my
handiwork with that fucking

draft detective, Glorice is
gonna be spending a stint in the

US Navy... maybe it will
make a man out of her.

Cheers.

Cheers.

To Glorice.

Wherever he or she may be.

Oh woops... nature calls.

Taking wee willy
winky for a walk?

I'll be back in a Flash...
Gordon.

Hey cream puff what the
fuck are you looking at?

Since when did pissing become
a... spectator sport?

You know I... I'd like to join uh...
whatever club you're in but uh.

I gotta run.

Oh that didn't hurt.

That hurt.

That's enough boys.

You're back.

George?

George!

George...

Are you ok?

Get your big fat ugly
mug outta my face.

George...

What happened!

Where's Glorice?

I don't know...
I thought she was in the Navy.

George?

Nice toss, Boss!

Who was it?

It was nobody, Joey I
just got nervous. That's all.

I was nervous too! But I
didn't leave you at the alter.

I don't know how I
can ever make it up to you.

I could think of a thing or two
actually. >> Stop it!

How do I know you
won't do it again?

Leave me up there facing
everybody I know.

I won't I promise.
But how can I know?

We get married now.

You mean today?
I mean right now.

We go straight to the
church and Father Doyle.

I don't think so.

Then we go on our honeymoon.

And you know what
we can do then...

Gianfranco, glad you made it.

I wouldn't miss it for the world.
What happened to your face?

What?

Your face!

Oh this? >> Yea that.

Oh I uh... I uh... I went to
the racetrack, I saw this great

horse, 3:1 shot, I stood behind it...
it reared up, kicked me in the face.

Boss...

Where's the beautiful
bride to be?

Good day Sister.

Nice outfit, George. A little
conservative but it looks good on you.

This is the end, Glorice, I
don't wanna do it but you made me.

I'm making you kill me?

Please, at least be honest
about what you're gonna do.

You're telling me about
honesty. Your whole life is a lie!

Why?

Why!

Because... you got, you know...
and you dress like a woman.

Well so are you. >> Well I
had to to get past your goons!

The only reason for
my body guards is

because you turned me
into the draft police!

I turned you in because
you wanna marry my boss.

Why can't I marry who I want?

Because.

Why? >> Because!

Why? >> Because!

He's not right for you.

Well who is, George?

Glorice in there?
Yea, with some nun.

A nun?

What the fuck!
Oh boss, no I can explain.

I can't believe it!
Joey, please.

My best friend and my fiance?

You must be the other
man from the telegram.

No! No! I'm not! I trusted you!

Nobody does this to Joe Aorta.

Give me your piece.

Now what do you gotta say for yourself
you miserable ungrateful little prick?

It's true Mr. Aorta,
I stole your woman.

So shoot me.

But don't hurt Glorice, it was
my idea. She did nothing wrong.

Joey, wait. Glorice, please.

This is between George and me.

I think there's something
you should know.

What the...

You set me... but you!

But you!

And then you!

In the car!

E nomini patri... e fili...
espiritu santi.

It's uh... rather unfortunate
we are gathered here today

to bury our friend
Mr. Joseph Carlo Aorta.

I was there when our boss
breathed his last breath.

There was nothing I
could do to save him.

All I could do was
hold him in my arms,

and listen to his final words.

And he said to me, George

it's your turn.

Take care of the men

take care of yourself,

but most of all

take care of this
beautiful woman.

I know... nobody

could fill the shoes of
this wonderful man,

but I'm gonna do my best.

Goodbye Mr. Aorta.
