I am black and beautiful.

O daughters of Jerusalem,

Do not gaze at me
because I am dark.

Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth.

Your lips are like
crimson thread,

your breasts are like two fawns
that feed among the lilies.

There is no flaw in you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Adonijah!
Adonijah, my brother!

Are you hurt?

Oh, of course not,
Solomon.

I always end a race this way.

No, don't move.
Let me see if you are injured.

So, you're
a physician now, too?

Is there anything
you don't know, Solomon?

I know you're too mean to be hurt
by such a minor accident.

Minor accident ?

It was spectacular.
I thought you'd been killed.

Imagine my disappointment now,
to see you still alive.

Get away from me!

I'm not hurt.

I won, Solomon.

Won? You have to cross
the finish line to win.

Look at you. . .
you can't even walk.

I can walk.

Pick him up,
pick him up!

Break camp!

The hunt is over.
To Jerusalem!

Are you in need
of help?

Only if you're
a physician.

Physician?

No, no, my lord!
Stop, stop, stop.

But my daughter
is skilled in herbs.

Many people say
she has healed them.

What is your name?

I am Azarel ben Asaph,
from Jaffa.

I travel to Jerusalem
to sell salt fish.

This is my daughter,
if we can be of any help, my lord.

What is her name?

She is called Abishag.

And she has healing powers,
you say?

She has healed many
in my village, my lord.

I am Solomon,
son of King David.

This is my half brother,
also King David's son.

If you help him, there will be
a handsome reward, I assure you.

To aid the son of our great king
is reward enough, my lord.

There is an oasis just there.

We'll test your daughter's
healing powers.

Why the fish themselves
do not get sick,

is a great mystery
to me, my lord!

Ah, ah. . .
do not worry, my lord.

Abishag will help
your brother.

My wife offers you
salt fish.

This is my business.
Here--

try it--
I think you will find it pleasing.

Mmm. . .
this is good, Azarel.

But how can you fish
if you can't abide boats?

No, I do not fish myself, my lord.
Never.

I buy from the boats
as they come in the evening.

We work through the night
to salt the fish.

Through the night?

The heat of the day. . .
they must be fresh.

Solomon!

Adonijah!

Are you all right?
Your wounds!?

Nearly painless. . .

Would that I had been
injured before. . .

were I to be touched
by this woman.

Abishag, come out.

Have you ever seen
such a creature?

And her hands,
they are touched by God.

She heals just by. . .
laying on.

Perhaps you'd like
to meet her father. . .?

Azarel ben Asaph
from Jaffa,

meet the recently revived
Adonijah from Jerusalem,

the son of King David
and Haggith.

Sir, I'd like to buy
your daughter.

She's not for sale,
my lord.

Then I'd like
to marry her.

No, my lord.

Hah-- you?!
Married?!

( vendors chattering )

May the King live forever.
Your blessing, Father.

Lord bless you
and keep you.

God make His face to shine upon you
and be gracious to you.

God lift up His countenance to you
and give you peace.

So, the hunt went well?

No, Father.
No game was seen.

Oh. . . so, no tales
to tell, then.

Oh, a tale of near death
to tell.

Wha. . .?

But without the hunt?

Adonijah challenged me
to a race.

An accident?

He was thrown from his chariot
when it overturned.

Is he injured?

That's the most interesting part.
He was hurt, badly.

He was cut, broken,
he passed out. . .

as we were rushing him
here to the court physicians,

but on the way, we met
an old merchant and his family.

( mimicking )  A dealer
in salt fish, O Illustrious One.

Though never have I set foot
on a boat myself.

The motion, Great One,
it brings on the sickness.

Why the fish themselves are not sick
is a mystery to me, my lord.

But then his daughter,
a great beauty,

took Adonijah into their tent
and within an hour,

he was nearly whole.
An amazing cure.

How?

Herbs, and a knowledge
of nature, she says.

Bring her to me, Solomon.

Perhaps she can do something
with this old body.

I will.

Solomon!

Solomon, let me approach her.

Who?
The girl you promised to our father.

You were listening?
I must have her, let me bring her.

The king commanded me. . .
A favor, I beg of you.

Solomon. . .?

Yes, all right.
Thank you, Solomon.

Acknowledge them.
It is you they are cheering.

Is it wise to be seen
riding together, Joab?

What could be more natural?
You take an interest in the army,

so you ride with
the general in command.

But much more important. . .
Yes?

it shows the army is behind you.
Solomon's a weakling.

You speak harshly of my brother?

Half brother.
With him on the throne,

this country will fall apart
within five years.

Or Bathsheba would rule.

Solomon's mother is not as strong
as she would like to think.

Stronger than her son.
So is my eunuch.

Bathsheba doesn't understand
that Israel's strength. . .

lies in her fighting men.
You do,

so the army's behind you.

Look at the people.
They love you.

You are the image
of what a prince should be.

And when the time comes,
and I think it will not be long,

we must strike.
Then, the throne of Israel is yours.

Now, where do we find
this young woman you lust after?

You wait till you see her.

Make way!

Come on! Come on!

I'm Joab, general in charge
of the armed forces of Israel.

You are commanded to present
yourself and your daughter

at the court of King David.

Arise. . .

you are in no danger.

I am Bathsheba, wife of King David,
mother of Solomon.

He tells me your daughter
heals wounds.

Is that true?

It is quite true,
my queen.

I'm not a queen.

He flatters me because he thinks
it will be to his benefit.

What's your name?

He's Azarel ben Asaph of Jaffa,
a seller of salt fish.

And this is his daughter,
Abishag.

Come here, child.

You're beautiful.

So, you're skilled in herbs?

I have some knowledge,
Majesty.

It is our wish that your daughter
remains here to nurse the king.

General Joab,

I'm thankful
for your interest. . .

in bringing
this girl here.

You may go now.

As you wish.

You may all go.

Azarel, come here.

What I am about to tell you
is vital information,

worth much
to the king's enemies.

You love the king?

Israel exists only because
of King David,

for God loves him.

The king's life
is drawing to its close.

Israel is divided,

and only King David
can bring us all together.

That's why I want your daughter
to use all her power. . .

to bring back
the health of King David.

And I promise that
when she will leave,

she will take with her
a dowry fit for a queen,

and she will be
as pure as she is today.

It shall be as you wish.

Good.

So, my dear, we'll prepare you
to meet the king.

David is dying.

Our king is dying.

He will not survive.

And when he dies. . .

who are they going to put
on the throne?

Solomon.
Solomon!

And you know as well as I do,
our kingdom will be lost

with him on the throne.
That's treason you're talking!

Treason?!

It's our duty
to consider the succession.

But it is the king's will
that Solomon succeed him.

But is it God's will,
Abiathar?

Joab, God's will
and King David's will

are one and the same.

Is it God's will that His kingdom
be governed by a weak man,

without ambition
for himself or his people?

Of course, as priests,

I look to you for guidance
in these matters.

And the army?

Well, naturally,
they'll follow your lead.

And yours, General Joab.

Adonijah should. . .

must be our new king.

But he cannot,
will not, unless you. . .

his newly elected High Priest,
anoint him.

High Priest?

Of course.

Let me explain.

It is essential. . .

that Adonijah be crowned
before David dies. . .

Abishag.

Well, come closer.
Come closer!

There's no need to fear me.

Oh, she makes me wish
I were young again.

But then, my dearest,

so do you.

Do you sing, child?

A little, my Lord King.

Play for your king.

( plays gently )

All is prepared for tomorrow
at the Stone Zoheleth, near Enrogel.

I'll send a company there with food
and wine enough to feast a thousand.

And the priests?

Abiathar is riding there
even now.

It has come to pass.

I n the morning, I'll spread the word
through the marketplace.

This time tomorrow, Adonijah,
you will be King of Israel.

Long live the King.

Joab?
My lord?

Oh, Joab, come,
come here.

You summoned me, my lord?

I'm troubled, Joab.

By what?

Memories.

Memories trouble old men.

Your memories should be
of battles won for God,

kingdoms established
in His name.

God's own words
trouble me, Joab.

Now therefore the sword shall
never depart from this house.

Do you remember those words?

Yes.
But that was a long time ago.

You remember the rest
of what God said to me?

No.

You were there, with me.

So I will raise up troubles
against you,

within your own house,
He said.

Within your own house.

Because of our conspiracy,
Joab.

That was a long time ago.
Well. . .

You paid a dear price.

Your firstborn died.
Bathsheba's. . .

but I gave her another child. . .
Solomon.

Yes, of course.

He will reign when I die,
of course.

Of course.

It is God's will.

Of course.

God's will. . .

Of course.

Please-- close it!
Close!

Close up! Close!
Close up!

Close.

Close up.

Hey, what's going on?
Haven't you heard?

They are anointing
the new king,

at the Stone Zoheleth.
Food and drink for everyone.

New king?
Adonijah.

Adonijah?!
Adonijah!

But, Solomon. . .?
Adonijah, I said!

Long live the king!
Don't you agree?

Long live the king.

Close up! Close!
Close! Close up!

Long live the king.

Close!

Close it! Close up!

What do you have to report?
You will be shocked to learn.

At the Stone Zoheleth,
this very moment,

Adonijah is being anointed king.

Abiathar and Joab anoint him.

Thank you. God bless you.
God go with you.

One who was there
has just ridden to tell me.

Mother. . .?

They are preparing
to anoint Adonijah king.

What?

Who?
Joab. The army.

At the altar of Stone Zoheleth.
One who was there just told me.

And King David?
He knows nothing about it.

They know
he is too weak.

I would never think
they'd dare.

You must see the king
at once.

Put the palace guard
on full alert.

Our lives are in danger!

Our lives?

Father will annul it.
Just because Adonijah. . .

Oh, Solomon!
Stop being so naive!

They'll cease at nothing!

They have nearly got
the kingdom in their grasp.

But not while I am alive.

You're going to be king
in spite of yourself.

Try to be a man!

More. . .

May the King live forever.

So formal, my love.

Why?
What is it now?

It was always
your promise to me. . .

that Solomon would be
king in your place?

Yes, I made that vow.

Well, today
your son Adonijah. . .

is to be anointed
to be King of Israel.

What?

By whose authority?

With the support of the army,
and much of the priesthood.

Joab?

Even so.

Joab-- Joab has
been loyal for 0 years!

He betrays you at this moment.

Nathan?
Come closer!

Is-- is this all true?

It is, my lord.

He is to make sacrifices and
Abiathar will pour the holy oil.

They are travelling to the altar
of Stone Zoheleth at this moment.

The eyes of Israel are on you
to tell them who shall be their king.

I am their king.

And as I swore to you
by the Lord, the God of Israel,

that your son Solomon
shall succeed me as king,

so shall I swear today.

Zadok?
Does he remain loyal?

He does,
and many other priests.

And the palace guard.

Good.

Nathan, take Zadok. . .

and the other
loyal priests. . .

and the palace guard.

Have Solomon ride on a donkey
from my stables,

not a horse, on my donkey,
and bring him down to Gihon.

And there let Zadok
anoint him king over all Israel.

This is my will.

My king.

( trumpets heralding )

( horn blowing )

( cheering )

You are a witness to history,
my wife.

Today God decides
who is to lead His people.

Two men now claiming
the throne, but I for one,

will follow the choice
of King David.

( cheering and trumpets )

Let the High Prince Adonijah
approach to be anointed king.

Solomon is being
crowned king! Wait!

Stop him!

Stop him!

What is the meaning of this?

Hear me! Wait!

Bring him forward!

Wait! Hear me!
I saw them leave the city!

They are going
to anoint Solomon king!

You lie!
It's not true!

I am anointed by God.

Listen, it's true!

You can see the procession
from that ridge.

Solomon is being anointed king

by a decree
from King David himself.

I'll show you. . .

Stop!
Come on!

Wait!

Stop!
Come!

I am your king!

I command you to stop!

Look!

I told you!

That is the palace guard.

And Zadok.
And Nathan the prophet.

They would act only
on the word of King David.

We've been lied to.

This is no king.

Treason,
that's what it is.

I want no part of it.

Stop! Wait!

I am your king.

Appointed by God!

I command you to stop!

Joab! Stop them!

How?

Use your army!

To do what?

The people fear God
more than they do the army.

Joab!

We lost!

We moved too soon.

Bathsheba beat us.

Too soon?! Lost?

You've killed us!

Probably.

I think that's not
the only sacrificial blood. . .

that will be shed
this day.

What's this?

I will not leave this place.

Go and tell Solomon
I will not leave this place. . .

till he swears
he will not kill me.

Adonijah, come down!

Do as I say!

As you wish,
Your Majesty.

You have proven
your courage once again,

by delivering yourself
to this court. . .

As always,
I serve my king.

Not always, Joab.

You killed Absalom,
my son.

Because he rose
against you, my lord.

I commanded he be dealt with gently,
you struck him down.

I n a victory for your armies,
my lord.

Now you have risen
against me.

No, my lord, never!

Against these, yes. . .

but not against my king.

Then bow to your king.

King Solomon!

As long as you live, Father,
there is only one king in this land.

The penalty
for your actions is death.

Wait, wait, wait.

My judgment is this:

While I live,
you live.

When I'm dead,

your life is in the hands
of your new king.

You're dismissed
from your command.

You're banished
from Jerusalem.

Thank you, my lord.

As always, your judgment
is full of compassion.

Your Majesty. . .

I meant you no harm.

What of Adonijah, General?

He clings to the holy altar,
my lord,

hoping for sanctuary.

Why didn't you
strike him down, General?

He is your son, my king.

And now, Adonijah.

What of him?

It is as you wish, Father.

He's also my son,
Solomon.

I cannot be impartial
in my judgment.

It was you he sought
to harm.

You must judge him.

He is guilty of treason.

The penalty is death.

I meant you no harm.

I swear it! I swear it!

I beg of you, spare me my life,
for the love you once bore me!

Solomon! Solomon!

Our father
showed mercy to Joab,

I shall do
no less for you.

If you prove
a loyal and worthy man,

not one of your hairs
shall fall to the ground.

But if treachery
is found in you. . .

you shall die.

My brothers. . .

and my people,
hear me.

I had planned
to build a house of rest

for the Ark of the Covenant
of the Lord.

But God said to me,

You shall not build
a house for My name,

for you are a warrior,
you have shed blood.

It is your son,
Solomon,

who shall build My house
and My courts.

Solomon, my son,

know the God of your father,
and serve him well,

with a single mind
and willing heart.

For the Lord
has chosen you

to build a house
as a sanctuary.

Be strong, and obey.

These are the plans
for the vestibules,

treasuries, upper rooms
and inner chambers

and all that God wishes
for His house,

as given to me.

My son is young
and inexperienced,

his task is great.

As this shall not
be a temple for mortals,

but for the Lord.

But I have provided,
as far as I was able.

Bring in. . .

( crowd murmurs )

Of my God,
I give to my God.

And I ask you to do the same.

For this shall be
the house of the Lord.

Bless the Lord, our God.

Crowd:
Bless the Lord, our God.

Solomon, Solomon.
Remember, Solomon,

a king must be strong.

If someone bars your way,
he threatens not just you,

but the good of the kingdom
as a whole.

You must cut him down,
like wheat.

Can you do that?
Hmm?

I can, Father.

I should never have granted
the life of Joab.

He served me well,
but he has served you badly.

When I'm dead, kill him.
Just kill him. Kill him.

If he plots with Adonijah,
kill them both.

Kill them.

You must now be king,
Solomon. . .

King!

King Solomon!

King Solomon!

King Solomon! King Solomon!
King Solomon!

Abiathar!

Joab!

So, this is what you do
in exile?

Yes, I've become
a farmer.

Long live
our glorious king!

May he reign
for at least another day!

Come!

Let me offer you some wine.

Good.

There's talk of Solomon
building a temple.

I've heard so.

I should preside as High Priest
when it's finished.

You may yet.

How? Solomon put that ancient
fossil Zadok in my place.

Well, we simply struck too soon.
We should have known. . .

while David is still alive.

But our time will come. . .
the moment he dies.

Solomon, a king.

If I had been in his place,
we'd both be dead men.

And who will you put
in Solomon's place?

Adonijah, of course.

Adonijah?

I thought you despised
his cowardice at the altar.

Even cowards can be useful
at the right moment.

( chuckling )

Did you tell yourself a joke?

For some reason,

a song keeps coming
into my head.

A song?
Yes.

You remember I once wrote
a song for the Lord

on the day we were
delivered from Saul?

Of course,
everyone knows it.

For the waves of death
encompassed me,

the torrents of perdition
assailed me,

the cords of Sheol
entangled me,

the snares of death
confronted me.

So. . .?
We were so dramatic!

Torrents, snares, waves.

Death is not like that at all.

It was when we were young.

Yes, but now,
it's whispers, not waves. . .

soft currents,
not torrents. . .

and very visible inclines,

not snares.

Don't talk about death.

The decree from of old is,
Thou must surely die!

And kings surely
must have many wives,

but we must not
talk about them.

Like flourishing leaves
on a spreading tree. . .

which sheds some,
and puts forth others,

so are the generations
of flesh and blood.

One dies,
another is born.

Every new creature
decays and ceases to exist.

Talk of death
to your other wives.

I'm only interested in. . .

your beauty,
and your wealth.

Bathsheba. . .

do you know what I fear
from death most of all?

What?

The absence of you.

( dirge horns )

You'll never have her now.

Joab. . .
She has status now.

She is no longer the daughter
of a simple salt fish dealer.

She was the favorite
of our greatest king.

I know this, I know this.

And when she is passed along
to Solomon, he'll have her.

Give me peace, Joab.

What do you want me to do?
I want you to be king!

Solomon is king!

Well. . .

only till you wrench the crown
from his feeble grasp.

David is dead.

That leaves only
one power in the palace.

Bathsheba.

Bathsheba.

But first we must show the people
that she no longer has. . .

a firm hand on the throne.

How?

If you could take Abishag,
David's favorite,

from under the nose
of the new king,

it would show you're still in the fight.
The people would notice.

She wants me.
I know she does.

Of course she does,
anyone can see that.

How should we do it?

Simple.
Just ask.

Ask?

Demand.

He'll want to placate you.
Solomon's weak,

showing you his mercy,
so that you will join his allies.

And soon you will have. . .

Abishag!

The throne.

( keening )

Thank you
for granting me this audience.

Do you come in peace?

I n peace.

May I speak openly with you?

Go on.

You know,

you know
the kingdom was mine.

And all of Israel
expected me to reign.

But things change.

The kingdom
has fallen to my brother. . .

For it was his,
from the Lord.

So now, I have one request
to make of you.

Please do not refuse me.

Go on.

Please ask Solomon. . .

King Solomon,

for he will not refuse you--

to give me Abishag
as my wife.

Men. . .

This is all you want?

Very well.

I will speak to the king.

Adonijah,

the kingdom was never yours.

It was always,

and will always be--

mine.

God of my father,
and my father's father,

give me strength
and courage

that I may be worthy
of this honorable duty,

and serve you well. . .

for I am weak. . .

and fearful.

Forgive me, Father.

I do not deserve
your throne,

but now I must be king,
as you commanded.

May the King live forever!

Oh, Mother!

Please take. . .

Bring a chair for my mother!

The ruler of Israel
bows to no one, Solomon.

Yes, I can see that.

Come, Mother.
Don't be humble,

take your rightful place.

Thank you for putting me here,
Mother.

I didn't put you here,
Solomon.

Of course you did.

But now that I am here,
I will deserve it.

By God and all His glory,
I will fulfill the destiny of Israel.

I have a request to make.
Do not refuse me.

Make your request, my mother,
for you know I will not refuse you.

Give Abishag to your brother
as his wife.

And why do you ask this
for Adonijah?

Because he came,
as a request.

I tell you so you may
know his mind.

His mind
is to have the throne.

Good, my son.

And so he begins again.

First, he asks
for this maiden,

then next he will ask
for the kingdom!

For he knows that any show
of weakness on my part

will be a demonstration
of his power.

Joab is near to that.

Now therefore as the Lord lives,
who has established me,

and placed me on this throne
of my Father, David,

today. . .

Adonijah and Joab must die!

Hey. . . !

Come back!

Out of my way!
Out of my way!

Move aside!

Traitor!

Get him!

I was to be king.

But you die as a traitor.

I ordered you
to kill him!

But my Lord King,
he's taken sanctuary!

Even now, he's in the Holy
Tabernacle, clinging to the altar!

I don't care where he is!

Strike him down!

Joab?

It's by command of the king.

You are to die.

The king commands
you come out, Joab.

No.

I'll die here.

I beg you,
don't make me kill you there.

I would commit sacrilege.

Which you cannot--

dare not, Benaiah.

I'm not ready to die.

Listen to me!

You know as well as I ,
there's not a man in Israel

fit to rule
in place of King David.

Did you think I believed
Adonijah could truly be a king?!

He was but a pawn.

The people's favorite,
oh, yes,

but ruler of Israel?

And Solomon. . .

that weakling?

To rule over
God's chosen people?

No!

Benaiah. . .

the only real power to rule. . .

lies in the army.

Only the army
can save our nation.

Let Solomon remain king,
yes,

but grant me my life--

and together
we will have the power.

Israel needs the army,
the army needs me. . .

you-- and me.

Together, Benaiah,
we will be the real power

to guarantee Israel's glory.

God's glory!

But the king has commanded!

Bathsheba has commanded!

Solomon is too weak!

You know I'm right,
Benaiah!

Is the mother's command
greater than the will of God?

Well, my friend?

Will you obey the king?

The king's mother?

Or your God?

Aarrgh!

Mighty King. . .

I thank you for your kindnesses
to us and to our daughter.

But what I . . .

I buy a good pearl
when I can,

for my daughter's future,
you understand.

But your bounty has--

has far outshone their worth.

Perhaps--

perhaps they could be used
in the temple.

They're poor things,
I know,

but I give them to you.

To you, Solomon,

and to the great God
we all serve,

the God of Israel.

I accept them
with pleasure.

And may God
keep you all in His hands.

We go!

Now will I prepare
to build Your temple, Lord,

here at the altar of Gibeon.

I'll make sacrifices,

cleanse my heart,

and listen.

Solomon.

Enter, Solomon.

Ask what you will of Me,
Solomon.

I am only as a child,
my Lord.

I do not know how to go out
or come in.

Grant me the wisdom
and knowledge

to righteously rule
this great people of yours.

Because you have not
asked for riches,

or long life,
or the lives of your enemies,

I give you the wisdom
of a clear and discerning mind.

But you must walk
in My ways,

keeping My statutes
and My commandments.

This skirmish was simply
a patrol to test our strength.

Our scouts confirm massed forces
just inside the Egyptian border,

which can mean
only one thing. . .

the new pharaoh, Shishak,
prepares to invade.

Well, if we do have
a war on our hands. . .

God be with us.

Jerusalem--
the Egyptian border-- Tyre.

General Benaiah, I want officers
to ride to every city in Israel,

measuring the distance
in the number of days it takes.

And I want to know the strength
of our army in each city,

foot soldiers, cavalry,
charioteers.

If we must fight, I want to know
what chance we have.

By Royal Decree,
from today,

the Kingdom of Israel and Judah
will be divided into twelve provinces.

I will appoint
a governor over each,

who will be responsible
directly to me,

who will administer
law and order,

and who will oversee
the collection of taxes. . .

( muttering and groaning )

. . .which from today
will be increased by one tenth.

( uproar )

Very impressive,
General Benaiah.

Yes, but they are few compared
to the legions of Egypt.

If they invade,
there'll be many widows in Israel.

When the Egyptians advance,
fall back before them. Don't fight!

Let thirst and the desert
do our fighting for us.

We can only fall back so far,
my lord, before we must fight.

Happily we won't have to.

Your king is to be married,
Benaiah!

A wedding!

I'm arranging to marry
the daughter of the pharaoh!

Let's hope she isn't ugly.

No war!
Peace through marriage!

Our king is
a brilliant statesman!

Long live the king!

Long live Solomon!
Long live Solomon!

( fanfare )

( music plays )

( cheering )

Ah, Nathan!

So, how is married life?

Very pleasant.

Very pleasant, indeed.

The pleasures of the body
are not to be missed, Nathan.

I have chosen to concentrate
on God's love, my lord.

Do you really think He meant you
to deny yourself, Nathan?

He made us this way,
did He not?

Why would He not want us
to taste of the fruit?

God put many things on Earth
we are not to taste, my lord.

If it were not so,
we would not have a free will,

and He would not be God, but
simply the creator of blind animals.

But I have tasted.

And I like it.

You are allowed,
even required, my lord.

But I warn you. . .

be careful not to give
yourself to any woman,

so that she gains. . .
mastery over your strength.

It may be too late, Nathan.
I'm exhausted!

But I have a matter
of some concern.

Speak.

It is rumored that you're allowing
your Egyptian wife

to build a temple
to Amon Ra.

I had to, of course.

It's a political marriage.
It's part of the treaty.

I'm not going to war over one
woman's temple to a foreign god!

It's against God's law.

Does God want war, Nathan?
I think not.

What of your other wives?

I haven't got any other wives.

You may eventually have many.
You grant the same to all of them?

Nathan!

The thought of having many wives
is too terrifying to contemplate.

I can barely satisfy this one.

Nathan. . .

I worship the one true God.

He will understand
even if you will not.

The king must be aware
that any child

from the daughter
of the Pharaoh of Egypt

cannot inherit the thrones
of Israel and J Judah.

I am perfectly
aware of that, Zadok.

But the council
must also be aware that

there are other reasons for marriage
than just the begetting of heirs.

I married the pharaoh's daughter
to avert war and bloodshed.

But my lord. . . !
Zadok. . .

in future, be advised that
I will marry to consolidate my lands

and to promote trade.

I will marry to insure peace
with my allies,

to discomfort my enemies
and to please myself.

And I assure you. . .

that I will marry to beget
heirs to the throne. . .

when I am ready!

Is it always like this?

Oh, I find fathers
always survive the ordeal.

A boy!

Oh, a fine Jewish boy.

I shall call him Rehoboam,

as a sign that the people
of Israel shall multiply.

Mother, meet the heir
to the throne of David.

Shh. . .

A boy!

A boy!

The King has a boy!

( murmuring )

The purchaser of the horse
claims he was not told. . .

of the vicious nature
of the beast.

Yet in the terms of the contract,
he was perfectly at liberty

to try the animal
before offering payment,

or accepting delivery.

The seller has the right
to remain silent

and let the buyer find
any fault he can.

It is the buyer's fault
if he does not do so.

The buyer must pay
full price.

Thank you, my lord.
Thank you, my king.

Zadok, why are there
so many people here today?

There is great interest
in the next case, my lord.

It came before the Provincial
Governor of Gilead.

Old Bengeber?

The facts are simple,
but the case, very complex.

Your judgment
is eagerly awaited.

( rapping staff )

my Lord King--

the facts of this case. . .

are well established,
and are not in dispute.

The two petitioners share a house
on the outskirts of Gilead,

where they ply their trade
as prostitutes.

Some six months ago,
one gave birth,

and shortly thereafter,
the second did likewise.

Both had boy children.

This dispute arose
after one of the babies died.

You may each state your case.

You go first,
you lying cow.

Then I'll tell the truth.

Well, we each have
our own room--

Are you a citizen
of this country?

Yet you show no respect
to your king?

Now, rise--

state your name
and the facts as you see them.

My name is Basemah.

It was just us in the house.

Us and our babies.

I'd gone to bed
with little Joachim.

That's his name. . .
Michael!

Michael is his name!
Silence!

Me and Joachim. . .

went to sleep.

And I'd given him
a good meal,

and he was
a happy little baby.

Well, that pig must have rolled
on her baby. . .

and killed him,

because when I woke up,
there was her baby beside me. . .

dead. . .

and my Joachim was gone.

Liar!
Silence!

A mother knows her own baby!
That is my baby!

Silence!

I'd pick him out
from a thousand!

What is your name?

Hannah, my lord.

Tell your story, Hannah.

It's a pack of lies!

She's clumsy enough
to smother her own child,

and thinks she can get away
with claiming mine!

That's my Michael!

And no woman,
or man on earth--

is going to take him
away from me--

Your Majesty.

That is for the King
to decide.

Was no midwife present?

No, my lord.

Lay the child on that table.

My judgment is this--

since both women
claim the living child

and neither
claim the dead child,

it is therefore fair that they
should share the living child.

So, I will cut
the child in half.

( pleading and outcries )

Spare my baby!

Don't kill him!

She can have him.

God bless this child. . .

Crowd:
God bless this child.

. . .and his children's children.

Crowd:
And his children's children.

And most of all. . .

his true mother.

Crowd:
Solomon! Solomon!

( chanting continues )

He spoke to the crowd
and said,

It is my judgment that both
women should share the child.

This is not wise.
A child cannot have two mothers.

They will fight
and ruin its childhood.

He took the baby,
laid it on a table,

drew a sword
from a nearby soldier. . .

and what do you think
he did?

I don't know.
Killed one of the mothers?

He raised the sword
over the baby

and declared he was going
to cut it in half!

Brilliant!

When the real mother saw
he was going to kill the baby,

she ran forward. . .

and screamed for the baby
to be saved. . .

. . .even if it meant giving
the baby to the other woman!

Exactly, my queen!

Brilliant!
