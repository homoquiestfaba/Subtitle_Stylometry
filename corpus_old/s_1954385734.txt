    ROUND YOUR BACK, PLEASE.

           THAT'S IT.

       THIS IS THE LOCAL.

      IT IS IN PREPARATION
        FOR THE EPIDURAL.

    IT'S HARD TO GRASP WHAT A
CONTRACTION ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE.

     SO I WANT EACH OF YOU,
   PARTNERS AND DADS INCLUDED,

       TO GRAB AN ICE CUBE
    AND GRIP IT IN YOUR HAND

       AS HARD AND AS LONG
           AS YOU CAN.

       I'M GONNA TIME YOU.

          OKAY. BEGIN.

          THIS EXERCISE
        IS TO ILLUSTRATE

EACH OF OUR PAIN THRESHOLDS ARE.

    A WOMAN'S PAIN THRESHOLD

    IS OFTEN QUITE A BIT MORE
          THAN A MAN'S.

OHH, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
                        MM-HMM.

    QUITE A BIT.

QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN A MAN'S.

        TOO MUCH FOR YOU,

         Aaron:
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS,

THERE'S BEEN MAJOR
   COMPLICATIONS

 FROM THREE DIFFERENT
ROUTINE COLONOSCOPIES,

THE LAST ONE ALMOST RESULTING
IN THE LOSS OF A MAN'S LIFE.

    HE WAS FINE.

           WELL, HE --
         HE WALKED AWAY.

          DAD, I BECAME A DOCTOR

             BECAUSE I WANTED TO
              BE JUST LIKE YOU.

          BUT YOUR CONTINUING ON

          IS NOT HEALTHY FOR YOU
           OR FOR THE PATIENTS.

 WE WILL TRANSITION
   YOUR PATIENTS,

AND CHRISTOPHER WILL BE
     FULLY VESTED

     AT THE END
OF THE NEXT QUARTER.

             IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
                    DAD.

             T-THE RACE IS OVER.

                  YOU WON.

    DID YOU HAVE
   CAFFEINE TODAY?

                   NO.

           I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.
     IT'S OKAY.
IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS.

WE'LL JUST TAKE IT AGAIN
     A LITTLE LATER

WHEN YOU'RE MORE RELAXED.
                      OKAY.

                      ALL RIGHT.

   LET'S SEE HOW THIS LITTLE GUY
   IS DOING TODAY.

             HE'S NOT SO LITTLE
                   ANYMORE.
[ CHUCKLES ]

OKAY.

      [ STATIC ON MONITOR ]

I'M SURE YOU'RE ANXIOUS
     TO MEET HIM.

              YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

        OH, I DO.
I HAVE THREE. [ LAUGHS ]

                   YEAH?

      [ STATIC CONTINUES ]

HMM, HE'S HIDING FROM ME.
      [ CHUCKLES ]

       HMM.

   YOU KNOW WHAT?

       I THINK
 THIS ONE IS BROKEN.

   I'M GONNA GO GET
A DIFFERENT ONE, OKAY?

                        OH.
     OKAY.

   BE RIGHT BACK.
                        OKAY.

         [ DOOR OPENS ]

               [ WHISPERING ]

     ALL RIGHTY.

            YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE?

  I DO. ALL RIGHT.

HERE WE GO. TAKE TWO.
                    [ CHUCKLES ]

      [ STATIC ON MONITOR ]

              WHAT'S GOING ON?

      [ STATIC CONTINUES ]

UH, YEAH, I'M GONNA GO
    GET THE DOCTOR.

ALL RIGHT.
          HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

          I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

       [ KNOCKS ON DOOR ]

             [ EXHALES SHARPLY,

HI, THERE, MAGGIE.

                   HI.

JUST LIE BACK PLEASE.

                    OKAY.
              WHAT'S GOING ON?

  JUST NEED TO TAKE
   A BETTER LOOK.

OKAY, THERE'S THE HEAD.

                   GREAT.

              WHAT'S GOING ON?
              WHAT'S HAPPENING?

   KEEP BREATHING.
 YOU'RE DOING FINE.

            [ BREATHING DEEPLY ]

                 HOW IS HE?

   HEY, PLEASE, PLEASE, WILL YOU
     TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING?

  DR. CAMPBELL, PLEASE, WILL YOU
     TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING?

MAGGIE, I CAN'T FIND
THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT.

             OH, NO. HE'S FINE.

                HE'S JUST --
            HE'S -- HE'S HIDING.

                [ CHUCKLES ]
            JUST CHECK IT AGAIN.

       I DID.

THE BABY DOESN'T HAVE
    A HEARTBEAT.

I'M SO SORRY, MAGGIE.

          BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,

          BECAUSE I CAN FEEL HIM
            KICKING RIGHT NOW.

      I CAN FEEL HIM KICKING ME.
  I'M SO SORRY.

  OKAY, JUST LET ME
  SEE HIM.

            JUST LET ME SEE HIM.
MAGGIE...

JUST --
OKAY, LET ME SEE.

LET ME SEE HIM
ON THE SCREEN.

MAGGIE...
          DO IT SO I CAN SEE HIM
                ON THE SCREEN.

      MAGGIE...

 YOUR BABY IS DEAD.

              NO! COME ON! NO!

  DO YOU UNDERSTAND
  WHAT I'M SAYING?

DID YOU -- DID YOU COME
     WITH ANYONE?

                   NO!

     YOU WANT US
TO CALL YOUR HUSBAND?

             HE'S IN A MEETING!

I'M SO SORRY.
                   PLEASE!

                   BE --

              OKAY. OKAY.
              NO! THIS IS CRAZY!

                NO! [ SNIFFLES ]

               OKAY, OKAY.
               HOLD ON A MINUTE.

          JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE.

       WE CAN JUST TRY IT AGAIN.

                   [ SNIFFLES ]

           JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE
           WITH HIM, OKAY.

      JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE NOW.

             [ BREATHES DEEPLY ]

         [ DOOR CLOSES ]

         COME ON, BABY!
            COME ON!

       [ SNIFFLES, SOBS ]

           IF YOU EVER SET ME UP
                LIKE THAT,

      I'M DISEMBOWELING YOU
         WITH A TROWEL.

      [ CELLPHONE RINGING ]
             LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.

             [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

             HOW'D IT GO?

             [ KEYS JINGLE ]

HI, MR. AND MRS. ROYAL.

         I'M CORINA NEVELLE,
     THE HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER.

       DO YOU MIND IF I CALL YOU
           MAGGIE AND AARON?

          THAT'S FINE.

           I KNOW THIS IS VERY
        DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT,

   ESPECIALLY NOW, BUT I HAVE TO
      ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS

        ABOUT YOU AND YOUR BABY.
              IS THAT OKAY?

             MM-HMM.

    IS YOUR BABY
   A BOY OR GIRL?

              BOY.

  IS IT YOUR FIRST?

DID YOU PICK A NAME OUT
       FOR HIM?

             ARTHUR.

                 THAT'S SUCH
               A STRONG NAME.

             MAGGIE, I NEED YOU
               TO THINK ABOUT

         HOW YOU WANT TO DELIVER
               YOUR BABY.

       UM...CAN'T YOU JUST
          TAKE HIM OUT?

     THE OPTIONS ARE NATURAL
 CHILDBIRTH OR C-SECTION, RIGHT?

         THE C-SECTION CARRIES
       MORE RISK FOR THE MOTHER.

NATURAL CHILDBIRTH CAN BE LONGER
       AND MORE DIFFICULT.

           TAKE IT OUT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

JUST -- JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

WE CAN'T JUST...
          OKAY. OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

          YOU...

                   GUYS,
           IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

            I'M GONNA RECOMMEND
            WE REST TODAY, OKAY?

          WE'LL INDUCE TOMORROW.

    I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK
        ABOUT ONE THING,

            WHICH IS
    AFTER ARTHUR'S DELIVERED,

    I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
SPENDING A LITTLE TIME WITH HIM,

      JUST TAKING A MOMENT
        AND HOLDING HIM.

      IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
        YOU'RE GONNA GET.

             I KNOW.
       I KNOW IT'S A LOT.

       BUT LOTS OF COUPLES
   WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS,

       WHO FACE THIS LOSS,
    THEY CHERISHED THAT TIME.

          THEY'VE TAKEN
        PHOTOGRAPHS, TOO.

       IT CAN BE HEALING,
     PROVIDE CLOSURE, OKAY?

         JUST SOMETHING
         TO THINK ABOUT.

            I KNOW THIS IS
      A VERY SENSITIVE QUESTION.

      I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE,
  BUT HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT

      ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT
   TO HAVE A CREMATION OR BURIAL

                FOR YOUR SON?

         NO. WE HAVEN'T
       THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

   IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD
       HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT?

      [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ]

     I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
        MY NAME'S STEPHANIE.

             I'LL BE YOUR NURSE
                   TODAY.

          IT OPENS AT THE BACK.
        YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

      [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ]

    Officiant: WE ARE HERE TO
CELEBRATE A LIFE THAT NEVER WAS.

    SO I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP
            TO ANYONE

  WHO WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WHAT
  ARTHUR'S LIFE MEANT TO THEM.

   UH, WELL, UM...

I HAVE TO ADMIT I WASN'T
LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING
CALLED "GRANDPA"...

...BUT I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
   TO MEETING MY GRANDSON.

UM...THIS CHILD NEVER KNEW
    ANYTHING BUT LOVE.

HE WAS NEVER HUNGRY.

 HE WAS NEVER COLD.

 FOR THE SHORT TIME
    HE WAS HERE,

    HE ONLY EXPERIENCED
THE BEST OF WHAT THERE WAS.

         FOR A BABY,
A DAY IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS...

 AND SO, FOR ARTHUR, WHILE HE
WAS HERE, HE LIVED AN ETERNITY.

     I LOVE YOU.

     I KNOW THAT BABY ARTHUR
           IS UP THERE

    PICKING OUT A WONDERFUL,
HEALTHY BABY FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

       EVERYTHING HAPPENS
          FOR A REASON.

    MAGGIE, AARON, WOULD YOU
      LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING?

       YEAH.

   IT'S ALL RIGHT.

I WROTE THIS, BUT...

  BUT I DON'T THINK
  THERE'S ANYTHING

REALLY FOR ME TO SAY TO HIM.

              I LOST SOMETHING.

                  NOTHING.
              NOTHING. NOTHING.

      YOU SURE?

                   YEAH.

                ARE YOU OKAY?

     YEAH. YOU?

             YEAH. I'M GREAT...

                  ACTUALLY.

I...I WAS JUST THINKING

IF -- IF YOU WERE IN THE MODE,

    MAYBE YOU COULD LOOK AT
THE SHELVES IN THE LIVING ROOM?

       I'M DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

   NO, IT'S FINE.

 I CAN DO IT, I JUST CAN'T DO IT
                   RIGHT NOW.
    IT'S OKAY.

        I CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

YOU BY MR. AND MRS. SCHLIT.

                   UGH.

    I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY BROUGHT
         THIS TO SAD PEOPLE.

  DO THEY HATE US?

    TALK TO ME, RIGHT?

  TONIGHT IF YOU WANTED.

                  I'M GOOD.

THAT I THINK IT'S HEALTHY
     FOR US TO TALK.

OR IF THERE COULD BE

              IT WASN'T STUPID,

        SOMETIMES THEY...

       THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
      GIVE YOU THAT OPTION,

     AND I'M GLAD THEY DID.

           PHYSICALLY,
     HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

       FINE.

       AARON? HOW ARE YOU
       HANDLING ALL THIS?

  TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I FEEL
LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN THE RUNAROUND.

        I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS
          TO DO WITH LIABILITY

     OR MALPRACTICE, BUT THINGS
    LIKE THIS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.

         UNFORTUNATELY,
       SOMETIMES THEY DO.

          I'VE RECEIVED
       THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

        WOULD YOU LIKE ME
   TO GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU?

       YEAH.

        [ CLEARS THROAT ]

 THE AUTOPSY REVEALED THERE WAS
   A CYST IN YOUR SON'S LIVER,

       AND IT METASTASIZED
            RAPIDLY,

        PROBABLY SOMETIME
     IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER,

     AND IT CAUSED THE ORGAN
            TO BURST.

                 IS THAT IT?

           THAT'S WHAT
       THE AUTOPSY FOUND.

             ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

       UM, WE WERE TOLD OUR BABY
             WAS HEALTHY,

                 THAT MAGGIE
             WAS HEALTHY, SO...

                  SOMEBODY
                MISSED THIS.

      I MEAN, A CYST, IT DOESN'T
      JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE.

      FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
   IN 50% OF ALL STILLBIRTHS,

        THERE IS NO KNOWN
         CAUSE OF DEATH.

            FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

    THAT'S PRETTY SHITTY SCIENCE
           IF YOU ASK ME.

      IT IS SHITTY SCIENCE.

              YEAH.

            I'M NOT TRYING TO --

        I'M NOT ACCUSING ANYBODY
           OF ANYTHING. OKAY?

                 IF THEY HAD
             CAUGHT THIS EARLY,

              AS IT SOUNDS LIKE
              THEY SHOULD HAVE,

        IF SOMEBODY HAD SEEN IT,

        COULD SOMEBODY HAVE DONE
           SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

    [ SIGHS ] I KNOW HOW HARD
       THIS IS TO ACCEPT,

    BUT THERE ARE A LOT MORE
 STILLBIRTHS THAN ANYONE THINKS.

           ONE OUT OF
        EVERY 160 BIRTHS.

      AND IN HALF OF THEM,
     NOBODY HAS A CLUE WHY.

        THE GOOD NEWS IS,

 WE GOT THE REPORT BACK FROM THE
 GENETICS LAB, AND IT'S NORMAL.

    SO GENETICALLY SPEAKING,
  YOU TWO ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE

            OF HAVING
    HAPPY, HEALTHY CHILDREN.

        YEAH,
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

                  MISS ME?

              MORE THAN YOU CAN
              POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

                YOU MISS ME?

      [ PAPERWORK SMACKS ]
    YOU MISSED ME
MORE THAN I MISSED YOU.

I DID.

[ SIGHS ]

        [ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

           OH, GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

  GLAD TO BE BACK.
        HMM.

  YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
         I LOST SOMEBODY.

                   BARRY,

             HE WENT LIKE THAT.

             AND HE BROUGHT DOWN
                THE COMPANY.

             BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

 I PICKED MYSELF UP AND I LOOKED
      MYSELF IN THE MIRROR

AND I SAID, "ROBERT, YOU ARE NOT
    GONNA LET THIS BEAT YOU."

               NOW, I-I KNOW.

         IT MEANS GIVING THANKS,
          BUT WHAT FOR EXACTLY?

                 IT'S LIFE.

            YOU KNOW, REGARDLESS
               OF WHAT OCCURS,

        AND OUR HEALTH.

               THEY START OUT

                 IN OUR ARMS
             SO LITTLE, FRAGILE.

              AND THEY GROW UP.

     THEY GO AWAY, AND THEY HAVE
       FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN.

               SO, THIS YEAR,
             I AM GIVING THANKS

       TO SOMETHING SO SIMPLE...

THAT TODAY I CAN SEE LIFE
 FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS,

JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE,

      JUST UNDER THE RADAR
            IS DEATH.

       AND WE RUN FROM IT

                       MM-HMM.

       <i> OUR</i> LEGACY.
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU!

              WHAT YOU GAVE ME
                IS PRICELESS.

       I KNOW THE KIND OF FATHER
          I'M NEVER GONNA BE.

 WHAT, YOU BLAME ME
   FOR EVERYTHING?

       YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

                 I HOPE SO.

                 I'M GOING
           TO BE WITH MY FAMILY.

   SURE, GO AHEAD.

YEAH, HAVE LOADS OF KIDS.
   HAVE LOADS OF KIDS!

'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.

     'CAUSE NO MATTER
HOW MANY CHILDREN YOU HAVE,

  THEY WILL ALWAYS
  DISAPPOINT YOU!

               I'M NOT SURE
          I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

              MNH!
         IT'S HAPPENING!

               NURSE, COME ON.

  [ INHALES SHARPLY ]
I REALLY WANT TO PUSH.

           HOW IS SHE?

            SHE WENT FROM 3 TO 7
                 IN NO TIME.

       I GUESS IT'S TIME,
              THEN.

           HI, MAGGIE.

  [ BREATHES DEEPLY ]
        HANGING IN THERE?

  NO.
          [ CHUCKLES ]

I REALLY WANT TO PUSH.

        I CAN'T BREATHE.

                 VERY GOOD.
             LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

                    OKAY.
             YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

  I CAN'T BREATHE.

             YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
                   MAGGIE.

                OKAY,
     YOU'RE GONNA KEEP HER CALM,

        SLOW HER BREATHING DOWN.

      I'M PROVING INCAPABLE
         OF DOING THAT.

                    OKAY,
             YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

         YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
                    THEY WANT ME
               TO CALM YOU DOWN.

               I'M NOT SURE
          I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

      OH, YOU'RE MAKING IT
         SO MUCH WORSE!
                           OKAY.

           OKAY, DEEP BREATH IN.

            JUST ONE MORE TIME.
            YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

        Nurse:
YOU'RE ALMOST COMPLETE.

    OH, PLEASE, LET ME PUSH!
             PLEASE!

            YOUR CERVIX IS GONE.

       OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA WAIT
     UNTIL THE NEXT CONTRACTION.

              YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
              A DEEP BREATH IN,

          AND YOU'RE GONNA PUSH,

     AND YOU'LL BE DONE WITH IT,
                OKAY?

                   OKAY.

                  GOOD JOB.

  WHAT'S GOING ON?

WHY ISN'T IT CRYING?

     [ GASPING ]
        HEY.

HEY, WHY ISN'T IT CRYING?

      [ HISSING CONTINUES ]
 WHY ISN'T IT CRYING?

         [ BABY CRYING ]

              OKAY.

          THERE WE GO.

              OKAY.

          IT'S A GIRL.

              OH, THERE SHE IS.

    IT'S A GIRL.

                THERE WE GO.

                   HERE.

               HI.

          OH, MY GIRL.

              YES.

              YES.

          [ CHUCKLES ]

         [ BABY CRYING ]

              HEY.

WOW. SHE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

    HERE YOU GO.

            YEAH. HI.

               HI.

      [ CRYING CONTINUES ]

      WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
 TO THE NURSERY IN A FEW MINUTES

            TO GET HER MEASURED,
                    OKAY?

        YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

               HI.

           NOW, DON'T BE ALARMED

              BECAUSE THE FIRST
             THREE TO FIVE POOPS

         WILL BE A GREEN, TARRY,
             MECONIUM POOP.

               IT'S TENACIOUS
            AND HARD TO GET OFF.

                 AND AFTER
           THEY'VE CLEARED THAT,

     IT TURNS INTO A BIRD SEEDY,
      MORE WATERY, YELLOW POOP.

             AND WITH EVERY
        BREASTFEEDING [CHUCKLES]

                 YOU'LL NEED
             TO CHECK HER DIAPER

        AND PROBABLY CHANGE IT
      ABOUT 8 TO 10 TIMES A DAY.

            OH, AND DON'T FORGET

             THE IMPORTANCE
         OF SWADDLING YOUR BABY.

    OKAY.
             IT MIMICS THE WOMB,

        AND LIMITS
        THEIR NORMAL MORO REFLEX

            AND KEEPS THEM CALM.

       RIGHT.

           YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

     AND IF YOU DON'T, SHE'LL BE
     THE FIRST TO LET YOU KNOW.

         [ DOOR OPENS ]

               HI.

  YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY,
  BEAUTIFUL, LITTLE BABY GIRL.

          WHAT'S WRONG?

       UM...

          [ SNIFFLES ] OH, UM...

               I DON'T FEEL
          HOW I THOUGHT I WOULD.

               I'M NOT HAPPY.

                I'M NOT SAD.

                I DON'T...
           REALLY FEEL ANYTHING.

       I KNOW.

               WHAT ABOUT JOY?

            WHEN DOES THAT COME?

      IN TIME.

            I THINK I'M GONNA BE
             A TERRIBLE MOTHER.

    [ CHUCKLES ]

    [ SIGHS ] NO.

    NOT POSSIBLE.

NOT WITH EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

       THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

        YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH HER.

                THIS CAN'T BE
                 YOUR FIRST.

            IT'S NOT.

              HOW MANY CHILDREN
                DO YOU HAVE?

          [ BABY COOS ]
              OOH.
