[radio transmission static]




Now, it's a little bit
more expensive,

but in terms of home security,
it's top of the line.

1080p, backup batteries,

and they're
practically invisible.

There is nothing
more off-putting

than inviting some folks over to your place,

they see one of these ancient,
convenient store cameras,

pointing directly at them as they're
waiting out on your front porch.

You know what i mean?
Who wants that?

No one.

These little
guys right here,

they can be hidden
almost anywhere.

"Discretion"
is the name of the game.

They can be indoor,
they can be outdoor,

underwater, anywhere.
Okay, now,

i wouldn't put 'em in the bottom of
your toilet bowl, or anything-- [laughs]

unless you're into
that sort of thing.

You seem like
a reasonable guy.

Why don't
we hook you up?

[Breaks squeak]


this is ridiculous.
Call him again.

He's on his way,
calm down.

I'm starving.
I'm tired.

I'm carrying
a bowling ball with me.

[Vehicle approaching]

yikes.
No fucking way.

Jesus. Claire, stop.

Come on. Come on.

[Lowered voice]
you're kidding me.

Hi, how you doing?
[Man] uh-huh.

buried in the backyard.

[Whispering] stop.
[Mumbling]

[man #2] oh, wow.
[Woman] oh.

is actually nice.

[Man #1] fireplace,

wood floors...

inlaid beams.

do you smell that?

It smells like a dirty diaper.

Jesus claire, shut up.

All these appliances new?
[Man #1] yep.

[Man #2] you did all the remodeling
yourself? - [Man #1] mm-hmm.

[Man #2] i'm not much of a handyman myself,
i can hardly change a tire.


[Man #1] office,
owners closet,

guest bedroom,

and the master bedroom.

Is there an attic,
or a basement, or anything?

No.

And you're okay with dogs?

Uh-huh.

You mind if we look around
on our own?

No, that's all right.

So, what do you think?
I can't breathe in there.

Well, it's not like we have to live with
the guy, just hold your breath whenever

he comes to fix
the garbage disposal.

It's like
spoiled mayonnaise.

Ugh!
I feel like it's on me.

It's not that bad.

We're gonna have to hire
an exorcist.

Just relax.

It's a cool house.

Ugh!

[Indistinct chatter]

oh, my god.
You got it?

Yeah.

You guys okay?
Don't turn it.

[Indistinct chatter]

[birds squeaking]

lady a bottle of champagne

for her house-warming gift.

It's stupid.
It's not stupid.

They're gonna be
totally cool with it.

It's not
a house-warming party,

it's just a big
get-together thing.

You gotta go to crate and
barrel every time somebody

moves into a house?
Give me a fucking break.

[Woman] hey!
Hey!

Hey.

good, really good.

Yeah. I'm not vomiting
every morning

like i was
in the first trimester.

But i've just been nesting,
and i don't know,

i'm-- i'm really excited

to meet this little person.
That's great.

That's not to say i don't miss
having a drink sometimes.

[Cork pops]

shit, i am so sorry.
Oh, no.

Oh, no.
No. I'm-- i'm sorry.

I-- i didn't think
it would take him this long.

the fucking traffic in this town.

You need a hand?
Yeah, you mind?

The trunk's open.
No problem.

Thanks, man.

Hey, sorry.
Nightmare of today.

Three hours?
I know, it's the traffic.

Getting out of the city
is brutal.

Paul and audry
got here fine.

Well, i'm the new guy,
i can't be cutting out early like paul.

Is this swordfish?
Yeah, it was on sale.

Ryan, i--
i can't eat this.

Why not?

There's mercury
in swordfish.

Claire, it's fine.

My mom smoked a pack a day
when she had me.

A little fish
isn't gonna kill you.

Right.


Every time i'd look up,
he'd be staring at me.

He wasn't looking in here.
He's just an old man.

He's a creepy old man.

You should have seen him.

The way he smelled.
Oh, my god, you could taste it.

You know he's got a key
to your place, right?

Paul.

Jesus, i didn't
even think of that.

What if i'm alone here
and he lets himself in?

He can't come in unless he gives
us a days notice. Calm down.

We have to change the locks.
Yep.

We're not changing the locks,
all right? Thanks, pal.

[Paul chuckles]
i don't know, man.

It's definitely not as bad
as the first trimester.

Yeah?
Like, i'm not as worried

she's gonna murder me in my sleep.
You know what i mean?

Jesus christ,

i guess that's progress.

Honestly, i'm just trying
to stay focused on work.

You guys
seem good tonight.

We're not fighting.

We're not really
doing anything.

She's got a bunch of shit she wants
to do before the baby comes,

so, i come home,
and i paint rooms,

or look at furniture,

i watch those
house renovation shows

and she tells me
what she likes,

and i smile and nod,
and we don't fight.

It doesn't sound that bad.

She's a great roommate
and that's pretty much it.

Are you guys still
not having sex?

take a wild guess.

Maybe she's just scared
you'll poke the baby.


It'll get better.

Why is it always so much better
in the beginning?

Because she hasn't heard
all your shitty jokes yet.

I mean, eventually she's bound to
find out you're not that funny.

[Chuckles]
you're not that cool.

If you stop trying so hard,

and she doesn't
have to keep pretending

that she likes
the taste of your dick.


you got a good thing, man.

It's just...

different.


honestly, the thought of it
makes me want to kill myself.

I don't want him to see me naked
for another three months,

at least.
[Laughs]

forget getting on all fours,
like i'm a piece of cattle.

You look great.

Ugh. Just a few more months,

and we get to meet
this little guy.

It's all worth it.
Right?

My ass will never be the same
mm-mm.

But, uh,
it'll all be worth it.

Your ass wasn't
the same after 28...

let's be honest.

[indistinct chatter]

so, tell me about that...

to her book club.

They meet thursday nights.
Tomorrow?

Yeah.
Sounds fun.

Yeah, i figured it'd be a good
way to meet some new people.

[Water churns]


it's not done?
Five minutes.

I got to go.
It's okay.

Hey, can you have your assistant
call the phone company?

We need a booster.
Do you have time?

I'm out
of the house all day.

I'm going to the park
and then pre-natal yoga,

and then straight
to audry's book club.

What time
are you gonna be home?

Late. Well, late for me.

10:30.

I'll look into it. Bye.

Bye. Love you.

[Crow caws]

what?

i miss you, too.

Yeah. He's helping.

He works a lot,
you know.

[Helicopter blades whirring]
i know, mom.

Sorry. Sorry,
hang on, mom.

Sorry.

By the pool.

I know, we just don't get
any service in the house.

Yeah, ryan's having
his assistant

come and hook up
a booster.


Okay, okay,

my water isn't breaking
anytime soon,

trust me.

Yeah, it's the best italian i've
had since i've been out here.

I mean,
it's not new york,

but it's still
pretty damn good.

I thought it'd be nice for us to just get
to talk, ou know? - [Woman] you know,

i've never heard you play.

Oh, no?
[Woman] no.

Is this your wife?
Where?

This picture of you guys
at the grand canyon.

Oh, yeah,
that's her.

Hmm. She's pretty.

Drink?

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

Bed?
[Laughs]

[music playing]

gosh, she doesn't seem like
a mean spirited bitch.

I don't wanna talk about her
right now. Okay?

When are you gonna tell her?

Ah, it's complicated.

and she uprooted her whole life.

I can't just leave.

[Woman sighs]
[ryan] you all right?

Yeah.

Yeah, i, uh--
i gotta get back.

What are you doing
tomorrow night?

I don't know.

Maybe we can get
drinks after work.


[door opens, closes]

hey, how was it?

Good.

I got italian.

Woo! You're the best.
I'm starving.

Hey.

[Dog barking]

baron.
[Barking continues]

baron, stop!

Can you go check on him?

Yeah.

Baron.
[Barking]

baron, stop.
What's going on?

Did you see something?

[Dog growls]

what's wrong, buddy?

Is he okay?
Yeah. I don't know.

He probably saw an animal
in the yard or something.

Ry?

Ryan?



Why?


what do you think,
to sort of balance it out?

Whatever you think.

the baby's gonna care.

It looks good.

Can you get a hammer?

Now?

I don't have a hammer
and nails.

[Claire] yes, we do.
Buried in a box somewhere.

This really
has to happen now?

Can you just try to care?

Ryan.
If it's gotta be done now,

let's just do it now.

What are you doing?

Ryan,
you're gonna break it.

There's gotta be a toolbox
in the owner's closet.

Oh, shit.

What?

This is not a closet,
it's stairs.

What?

It says this was
an owner's closet, right?

Ryan,
don't go down there.

Ryan?

[Door creaks]

[door slams shut]


what the fuck was that?

It-- it was a draft.
It just shut the door.


those stairs
are creeping me out.

We don't have to do
this now.

Okay.

Hey.
Chuckles

hey.

Hey, i'm sorry.
I've been with her all day.

I can't today,
we're running errands.

How about tomorrow?

Well, she's gonna
be gone all day,

i figured
you could come here.

I don't care.

i'll heat the pool.


I love you too, mom.

Okay. Sounds good.

All right, bye.

Two hours?

Two hours north?

It's not that bad.

That's pretty bad.
[Laughs]

it's just like
the one my mom had.

It'll be fun,
we can drive up the coast.

It better be the best damn
rocking chair i've ever seen.

Don't be a baby.

We can grab lunch
on the way.

I just don't want to leave
baron for too long.

He can handle five or six hours.
It'll be fine.

Stop worrying.
All right, come on.


[doorknob turning]
[baron barks]

[barking continues]

[door creaking]


[barking continues

come on,
i'm freezing.

All right, hold on.

Your highness.

I wanna see how the chair
looks in the nursery.

Chop, chop.

Here, what do you think?

Ahh.

Ooh.
What's wrong?

It's kind of uncomfortable.

You're kidding.


[Shower water running,
faucet turns off and squeaks]

what time are you
gonna be back tomorrow?

Huh?

What time are you gonna be home
tomorrow night? You wanna get dinner?

Oh, i've got
my mommy group potluck.

You know,
dad's are welcome.

I'm swamped.

Maybe if i get done early.

All right,
you're missing out.

Oh.

Ew.

What's wrong?

Ugh. My toothbrush stinks.

Pregnant nose.

No, i mean,
it smelled like shit.

It always smells like shit.

You ever smell your floss
after you're done using it?

It'll make you throw up.

Really?

Yeah, it's gross.

Come on.

Are you kidding me?
It's freezing.

Come on.
Stop it!

You are such a jerk.

Baby.

Is claire older than you?

We have to talk about her
every time you're here?

No, i just was wondering.

Yeah, she's 30.

Wow. Older woman.

She's not that old.
I'm 27.

How'd you guys meet?

In new york,
at a bar.

You wanna get
dinner tonight?

Did you approach
her, or...

i don't know,
i guess.

We were at a club and my
buddies and i had a table,

and one of my friends
invited a bunch of girls up,

and we sort of
just hit it off.

Well, she's prettier
than you.

i guess that's my type.

Are you done?

Do you still love her?

I don't know, hannah.

She was coming up on 30,

and she just wanted
to get right to it,

and i fell for it.

We got married quick
and she just changed.


i've been unhappy
for a long time.

Now about you...

you're all
i ever think about.

I'm in love with you.

And now
you're in the pool.

No, i'm not ready
for the pool right now.

Here we go.



Great dane.

That's-- that's
a hell of a dog.

You're probably fine with,
uh, one of these right here.

These are pretty good.

Uh... okay, well...

this is probably overkill,

but uh, i mean,

a tire wouldn't break out
of these things.

[Machinery buzzing]

[drill buzzing]

[buzzing continues]



[hammering continues]


ryan?


ryan?

What happened?

Did you feed baron
table food?

No, of-- of course not.

Has he been sick?

I didn't feed
him anything.

There are chunks of bacon
and food in his vomit.

Maybe he got some off the table
when i wasn't looking.

[Sighs]
i'm sorry.

I brought you meatloaf.

[Phone buzzes]


your phone.
[Buzzing continues]

who is it?

No one.

J-- just peter at work
drunk texting,

go to sleep.

Shit.

what's his problem?

I don't know,
i'm gonna tell him to knock it off.

Good night.

It's one in the fucking morning,
what're you doing?

It's one
in the fucking morning.

You know you can't be
calling this fucking late.


i-- i don't know,
not for a while.

Hannah, i gotta go, okay?
Don't call.

I'll talk to you
on monday.

jesus fucking christ.

¶ Give me a reason ¶

¶ to lift you up
to pass the season ¶

¶ although we never see
the light ¶

¶ oh baby,
we just might ¶

¶ electric fever ¶

¶ i tied you up,
i get your nearer ¶

[music continues]

[dog panting]

[music plays faintly]


[music plays faintly]


what's going on
with you, pup, huh?

[Knocking on the door]

hannah?

Wow, um,
you're pregnant.

I am, yep.

Uh, please, come in.

Thanks, yeah, i--

yeah, yeah.
It's straight back.

Okay.

So, the guy at the store

said it's supposed
to be pretty easy,

but i'm not very good
at this stuff, so,

we'll give it a go.

I'm home.

How was your day?

Hi.

Hey, babe.
Hey, what's going on?

Oh, hannah just came by
to hook up the booster.

Yeah, i am sorry though i wasn't
much of a help with that.

You were great, thank you.

I really appreciate
you taking the time.

How was santa barbara?

So, you guys been hanging out
all afternoon, huh?

we're old pals now.

Yeah, i should probably
get out of your hair.

And i will call
someone right away

to fix the whole thing.
Thanks so much.

It was so nice meeting you.
It was nice to meet you, too.

Um, i will see
you tomorrow.

Yeah, i'll see you
in the office.

You hungry?

Um, yeah.

Oh, is this her phone?

Hold on,
let me catch her.

What're you doing?
She called me,

she asked me to come here.

Yeah, maybe you wanna
call me next time?

You were in santa barbara.

How could you be
so fucking reckless?

Look, it would have been weirder
if i didn't come here at all.

What're you trying to do?

Nothing.

All right.
We'll tomorrow.

She's pregnant.

Well, it's not like
it's a big fucking secret.

You've got to tell her.

Go home.

All right,
see you then.

All righty,
what are we eating?

She's pretty.
Think so?

How was your day?
Good. Busy.

I ran some errands,
and i got a few things for the nursery.

The baby's getting
spoiled already.

He better be.

You said
she wasn't pretty.

Did i?

She's a good assistant.

She's sweet.

She's like
a baywatch model, though.

You've got nothing
to worry about, okay?

I'm not worried.

I'm just fat.

You're not fat.

You're pregnant.
Come here.

I love you.
Okay?

I love you, too.

[Claire moaning]


[buzzing continues]

fuck.

[Phone buzzing]

what the fuck are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

Oh, my god!
Woo.

Yeah, i'd like to block
a phone number, please.

From both phones
on the plan.

It's 323-555-5359.

That will go into effect
immediately?

How long does it take?

All right.

Okay, fine.

What's wrong?
Lots of work stuff.

I almost singed my eyebrows off
with this fucking thing.

Huh?

What's going on?

Nothing,
it's complicated.


i've been seeing someone.

What?


What are you fucking kidding me?
Since when?

Since i moved out here.

What are you thinking?

I don't know.

It just kind of happened.

I was out here on my own,
and things were bad with claire,

and it just happened.
And kept happening?

It's getting out of control.

You've got to tell her.

What, are you
fucking crazy?

I'm trying to fix this,
not throw it away.

She came to the house
yesterday.

She called
claire's phone.

What?

She's trying
to fuck up my marriage.

You got to break it off.

[Indistinct chatter]

no shit, paul.

Ryan?

Yeah.
I can't get it to work.

Oh, that sucks.

Do you want
to give him a call?

Yeah.

[Phone buzzing]

[buzzing continues]



hello?

Hi, it's claire,
from uh, 1023 vista del mar.

Um, our toilet
won't flush.

Could you come and fix it?

Uh, tomorrow.

Okay, uh, well,
when can you come by?

11:00 a.m.

can you come before 8:00?

No.
Huh.

Yeah, you know what?
11:00 a.m. is fine.

Thank you.
Uh-huh


i don't wanna
be alone with him.

He couldn't
come any earlier?

No.
It's fine.

He gives me
the fucking creeps.

[Doorbell ringing]
[baron barking]


it's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. There.

[Barking continues]

hi.

Sorry to drag you out here.

Oh, he likes you.

He doesn't like anyone.

[Jiggling lever]
see what i mean?

I don't know
what happened.

Uh-huh.

Well, i might need
a little room here?

Oh, sure. I'll--
i'll wait outside.

Mm-hmm.

[Toilet flushes]

oh. You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.

Uh.

Thanks.

Boy or girl?

Oh, we're keeping
it a surprise.

Girl.

It could be.

Thanks for coming out.

[Claire sighs]
i'm stuffed.

Claire?
Uh-huh?

Can we talk?

What's wrong?


i think we should
start seeing someone.

Like, a--
a marriage counselor?

Yeah.

we were doing good.

We're not.

Is there someone else?

No, claire,
of course not.

It's just...

i just think we should
start working on it

before things get bad.


i just-- i don't want
to fuck this up.

It'll be good for us.

Yeah.

I love you.

[Phone buzzes]

hey, mom.

Mom?

Mom, can you hear me?

Mom, are you there?

Hold on.

Yeah, we actually had
the first session today.

No, it was...
it was really good.

Yeah. Yeah,
i mean, i...

it wasn't working,

i was just hoping it was
because i was pregnant,

or something

yeah.

Yeah, no, me, too.
Me, too.

I'm-- i'm glad
that we're, uh...

you know,
getting on ahead of it.

I... yeah.

Hey, mom, um, can i--
can i call you back?

Hey, audry,
it's claire.

Um, are you missing a ring?

I just-- i found one by the pool,

and i figured
it's probably yours.

Uh, give me
a call back. Okay.

Hey.

You all right?

Yeah.

What are we eating?

I don't know.

You all right?

Yeah, just...
long day.

Okay.

[Phone buzzes]

restricted number.
[Buzzing continues]

yeah, i've been
getting those all day.

Who is it?

I don't know,
i didn't answer.

Hello?

Hey, i'm sorry,
my service is terrible, hold up.

why are you calling me?

Did you call claire?

Hannah, hannah,
this has got to stop.

Okay?

I thought you knew!

That's not gonna
fix anything

look...

we'll talk tomorrow, okay?

If you come to the house,
i'll call the police.

Hannah.

Don't you fucking do that.

Hannah, don't you
come to this house right now.

Hannah.
Hannah?

Sh--

hey, what do you say
we go out to eat tonight?

No, i don't wanna
go out in public right now.

Come on, it'll be fun.
You look great.

No, let's just
get a pizza.

When's the last time we went out to eat?
Come on, it'll be fun.

Come on.
Okay. Let me get my jacket.

Okay, hurry it up.

Come on, claire.
All right, all right.

Jeez.

Claire, come on,
let's go.

[Knocking on door]


uh, claire?


it's me.
I'm at your house right now,

and i'm not leaving
till both of you get back here

and we talk about this.

Okay?
I'm not leaving.

[Door opens]

[floorboards creaking]

[yells]
[screams]

[baron barking]


[engine turns over]

hey, man. It's me.

Look, dude,
there's nobody here.

You gotta fire
this girl.


and i shouldn't
be involved in this

in the fucking first place.

So, you should tell claire,

'cause she doesn't deserve this,
and neither do i.

[Claire] oh, i'm beat.
[Ryan] that was fun.

Yeah.
Yeah.

You coming to bed?

Yeah, i'll be in
in a minute.

Fuck.

No! No, shit, shit,
shit, fuck!


My phone.
Did you spill this?

Oh, shit. Here.

Put it in rice.
It'll suck out the moisture.

All my pictures.

All the pictures
of my belly,

and the trip
to san francisco.

Oh, shit, claire.

I'm sorry.
What happened?

Fucking glass of water.

Did you knock that over?
I don't know.

I don't think so.
Maybe it was baron.

It's all right,
i'll bring it in,

i'll get it checked out.

Maybe we can
take the photos off.

Okay.
I'm sorry.

I gotta go.

What are you doing today?

Um, i don't know.

Going on a hike
with audry, i think.

Claire.
[Sighs]

it's gonna be okay.
I'll get it fixed.

I can't do that hike
on a good day.

Exercise is supposed to make
the delivery faster.

Really?
That's what they say.

Hmm.

[Water splashes]
[sighs]

it's so nice.
Yeah.

Did i send you a picture
of that ring?

Oh, yeah.
It's not mine.

No?
Mm-mm.

Has anyone else
been in the pool?

No.

I don't really know
anyone else out here.

Well, it could have been anyone's.

Maybe the people
who lived here before.

Maybe.

[Loud bark, whimpers]



you're probably gonna
have to get a new number.

No, you've got
to be kidding me.

I know.
It blows.

Just post something
on facebook.

You'd be surprised how many
numbers you actually use.

Can they get my photos off?
I don't know.

Josh is gonna bring it in
tomorrow have it checked out.

Who's josh?

He was my assistant today.

What happened to baywatch?

Hannah?
Yeah.

I don't know.
She's been real flakey lately.

Didn't show up,
didn't even call in sick.

Does josh have blonde hair
and big boobs?


I like him.
Yeah. Good.

Do you know
whose this is?

What is it?

It's a ring.
Huh.

Where'd you find it?
By the pool.

Huh.

No idea.

[Tv show playing]

do you hear that?

What?

[Turns tv off]

what is it?
Shh.

You're hearing things.
Come on.

[Mechanical rewinding]

drive-thru intercom: welcome.
This is jason. Can i take your order?

[Vehicle approaching]

[hannah screams]
[silence]

[hannah screaming]



[drill buzzes intermittanly]

[hannah screaming]

ah!

Help me!

ahhh!

Ah!

[Both screaming]

[mocking her] help!


eat!

Eat!

[Hannah whimpers]

maybe tomorrow we'll--
we'll give you a bath.

You trusted him.

How was your night?

Weird.

Yeah, with the lens.

I think it's just a hole.

i swear.

i don't know.

You know what...

maybe it's part
of the security system.

It was there today
and now it's gone.

Maybe it's part
of the lease.

I could go over it.

You know what?
Just go.

I'll stay here tonight
if you're freaked out.

No.

Can you call audry?

[thumping sound]


[door shuts]

About seven weeks.
About seven weeks?

Uh-huh.
Hmm.

There's no sign
of forced entry.

Uh, still a bunch
of expensive stuff,

just lying around
all in plain sight.

Mm-hmm.
The place looks good.

All right.

Looks like we'll be getting out of your hair.

There's just a locked door
in the back hall.

Could be a closet,
or a bathroom, something.

It had been three weeks
since they missed rent?

uh... uh-huh.

you didn't bother them?

They didn't come
knocking on your door?

Well, times are tough.
Huh.

I wish you were my landlord.
Mm-hmm.

[Officer coughing]

[officer sniffs]


Animals.
