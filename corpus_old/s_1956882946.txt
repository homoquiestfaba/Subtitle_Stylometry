I thought that we could
build our nest high up...

in the trees.

Fly away, like birds...

to the mountains.

Potatoes.
Potatoes.

Oh, we have
so many already.

Hi, Franz
See you!

Don't you want an apple too?
One is plenty. Thanks.

by James Newton Howard

Remember
the day when we first met?

You were shy like now.

I remember.

That motorcycle.

My best dress.

You looked at me...

and I knew.

How simple life was then.

It seemed no trouble
could reach our valley.

We lived above the clouds.

My sister
came to live with us.

He likes you.

We had our home.

Your mother,

our family,

our village,

Radegund.

Ah!

Dear Fani,

warm greetings to you
from your Franz in training.

This week,

I have things easy.

In the mornings,
riding on a motorcycle.

For me,
it's entertaining.

Hello, mountains!

I would love
to hear your singing again.

Hello, sun!

I'm looking forward
to our reunion.

I met a fellow here.

His name is Waldland.

How are you doing this?
Well...

In two months of training...

No pretense about him.

I wish that
I could be a little mouse

In the cornfield

Always smiling.

And I
would be out there in the...

Sometimes I wish

I could be a little bird...

March! Stab!

Move, move! Stab! Move!

Take positions!

My dear husband,

they say that
France has surrendered.

They're
sending farmers home...

for now at least.

Is it true?

Sister's lonely.

I wish
she had someone like you.

We could use you here.

To break in the calf.

The harvest comes nearer.

We burned the bad weeds.

I got some piglets
from Mossbauer.

Four weeks old.

114...
135. Come on, that price is good.

With warm greetings
to you...

Your loving wife,

Fani.

Those are fields taken in military campaigns.

Seized by German soldiers.

Oh, my wife,

what's happened to our country?

To the land we love?

Where are the kids?

Inside.

Oh,
Papa's coming for you!

What is it?

I've just been called up.

We thought there would be peace,

but this war goes on.

I don't know why.
Shh.

Do you believe
in what we're fighting for?

Not really.

Cheers!

He did what he had to.

He was not content
to watch his nation go under.

Before he came, it all was
in a state of collapse.

A Babylon!

We worshipped foreign gods.

You're drunk.

No!

And I am not your friend.
I am your Mayor!

And now they tell us

to spare these other races.

Degraded.

So contemptible they can no
longer despise themselves!

They sow the earth with salt.

Instead of a world,
there is a department store.

Foreigners swarm
over our streets.

Immigrants who don't care

for the past,
only for what they can grab.

This is what happens
when a world...

when a world dies.

Men survive.

But their life is gone.

Their life is gone.

Their reason for living.

Cheers, this is to the new times! Cheers!

The mask is off.

I fear for my family.

Mother's old.

Yeah.

I hope she dies soon.

Don't they know evil
when they see it?

We're used to it now.

Crime.

No shame.

Be careful.

Father, if they call me up,
I can't serve.

We're killing innocent people.

Raiding other countries.

Preying on the weak.

Now the priests call
them heroes, even saints.

The soldiers that do this.

It might be that
the other ones are the heroes.

The ones who defend their
homes against the invaders.

Have you spoken
with anyone else?

Your wife?
No.

Family?

Don't you think

you ought to consider
the consequences

of your actions?

For them?

You'd almost surely be shot.

Yes.

Your sacrifice

would benefit no one.

I'll speak with the Bishop,
about your case.

A wiser man than I.

Thank you.

Thank you.

These last weeks,
you're different.

What is it?

Morning.
God bless.

We are collecting
for the war effort.

Hmm. I see.

I'm sorry, I...

Look, as I said,
I don't have anything to give.

I'm...

Please...

No.

I wish you all a good day.

Just let me do it.
I'll speak to him.

He says he is going through hard times.

You have refused to
contribute

to our collection
on behalf of the veterans?

Their families?

I also hear
that you have refused

to accept the family allowance,

and other subsidies the state
would have provided you.

Why?

Franz. Tell me.

Show a little humor.

Yes.

Nobody refused but you.

Please.

Thank you.

Then, what did we come here for?

We must be strong.

Stand firm.

Learn the lesson
of the blacksmith.

No matter how hard
the hammer strikes...

the anvil cannot,

need not, strike back.

The anvil outlives the hammer.

That which is hammered
on the anvil,

takes its form,

not only from the hammer,
but the anvil, too.

The Bishop is waiting.

Have a seat.

Your excellency.

Thank you so much
for speaking with me.

If God gives us free will,

we're responsible
for what we do...

what we fail to do...

aren't we?

If our leaders

are not good...

if they're evil...

What does one do?

I want to save my life,

but not through lies.

You have a duty
to the Fatherland.

The church tells you so.

Do you know the words

of the apostle?

"Let every man be subject

to the powers placed over him."

Do you hear those bells?

They're melting them.

For bullets.

I think he was afraid

that I might be a spy.

They don't dare
to commit themselves,

or it could be their turn next.

We can't blame
the Bishop for going along.

He hoped, by doing it,

that the regime would be more
tolerant towards the Church.

But now, the priests are sent

to concentration camps.

Church processions banned.

We don't have a say.

What can we do?

We,

little people here.

Give me
a piece of coal.

Coal?
Just one.

Just one?
Yeah.

Thank you.

I paint the tombs
of the prophets.

I help people look up
from those pews and dream.

They look up and...

they imagine that if they
lived back in Christ's time,

they wouldn't have done
what the others did.

They would have murdered
those whom they now adore.

I paint all this suffering,
but I don't suffer myself.

I make a living of it.

What we do

is just create

sympathy.

We create...

We create admirers.

We don't create followers.

Christ's life is a demand.

You don't want
to be reminded of it.

So we don't have to see
what happens to the truth.

A darker time is coming...

when men will be more clever.

They won't fight the truth.

They'll just ignore it.

I paint
their comfortable Christ,

with a halo over his head.

How can I show

what I haven't lived?

Someday I might have
the courage to venture.

Not yet.

Someday I'll...

I'll paint the true Christ.

Heil, Hitler!
Fear Hitler!

They won't call you up.

They need farmers.

How else are people
going to eat?

Maybe the war will end soon.

Is she asleep?
Yeah.

Why are you
looking at me that way?

It's an act of madness.

A sin...

A sin against his family,
against his village.

We're different, Mother.

I'm sorry.

But I am grateful to you
for wishing me the best.

Your life was
hard enough already.

His mother
looks at me coldly,

like I was to blame.

I want what you want.

But I can't bear
that he makes you suffer.

He makes a choice for you, too.

Does he know what he's doing?

Tell him.

Pride.

It's pride.

That's what it is.

Did they say
something to you?

I saw them speaking
to you by the road.

They said...

...their husbands
have gone off to war.

Why should they fight to...

save us?

Did they hurt you...

with their words?

I don't care.

All good?

Yeah.

You were a wild one.

You fought with the police.

You know, you remember.

Who changed you?

Your wife?

I have sympathy with you.

I don't want anything bad.

I know.

So...

Help me.

Radegund loves you.

You...

You are a child of Radegund.

I am not your enemy.

I'm your friend.

Yeah?
Yes, I am.

You still belong to our people.

You cannot say no

to your race.

And your blood.

And your village.

And your home.

We have to defend our land!

Till he came,
the people were in despair.

Humiliated. In chains.

Who do you think
they will make responsible?

It's me.

Who do you think
they will interrogate?

You'll be hanged!

Do you understand
what that means?

They'll hang you!

Your family, your wife,
your children,

will have no one
to support them.

Your mother will die unconsoled!

Calm down.

Don't touch me.

Don't touch me.

You're worse.

You're worse than them!

Because they are enemies,

but you are a traitor!

I've been there, to Vienna.

I saw what happened there.

Lost.

They kicked her
in her face. Bleeding.

Torn from the tent
in which we trusted.

Killing the insane. Children.

Brought to
the King of Terrors.

We saw the hate in their eyes.

We've forgotten our
true Fatherland.

[Mayor Kraus:]
What would your father say?

What do you think?

He fought.
Mm-hmm.

He died.
Yes.

And what do you think
what for he died?

In the trenches, in the mud?

Think about it.

Yeah.

I had a dream.

I saw a train.

The locomotive
was powerful and dark, and...

it drew the children.

And you couldn't see
where it was going, just...

the fields and trees
flashing by.

I hold to a memory.

Of what I knew once.

I find no one to turn to.

Nothing enters my soul.

Let him go in peace!
Watch out! You dogs!

When have our prayers
not been answered?

If we're faithful to him,
he'll be faithful to us.

I believe it.

We have him.

That's enough.

The whole world is sinking.

There's no answer.

To follow him...

is insanity.

[from Arvo PÃ¤rt: "Tabula Rasa"]

What are you going to do, Franz?

They ask you to take an oath

to the Antichrist.

I know, I know.

It's a life without honor.

Is this here,

the end of the world?

Is this the death

of the light?

We are like a breath.

Like a shadow
that passes away.

Madness!

I've been called up.

You could hide
in the woods.

We'll run away!

To the mountains!

Does a man have the right to let

himself be put to death?

For the truth?

Could it possibly please God?

He wants us to have peace.

Happiness.

Not to bring suffering
on ourselves.

We have to
stand up to evil.

You're going to do it,
aren't you?

[Sister Resie:]
Her happiness is in your hands.

She could have had other men.

We have enough troubles
in our lives.

You want too little
for yourself, Fani.

Why don't you oppose him, Fani?

Hmm?

Resist him.

You don't know
what unhappiness is!

Your man never left you.

Oh, okay.

You can't change the world.

The world's stronger.

I need you.

You could work
in a hospital.

There's nothing wrong with that.

Is there?

You want to have more?

My dear son.

You're all I have.

You know what it is like
to grow up without a father.

I know what it's like
to be alone.

[From the St Matthew Passion by Bach]

Girls, your...

Your father is going away.

On a journey.

On a long journey.

He'll be gone for a while.

God bless.

You want to follow the train? Be careful!

Name?

JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter, Franz.
From Radegund by-the-Danube.

Next one!

I swear by God to give the Leader
of the German Reich and people,

Adolf Hitler, supreme commander
of the armed forces,

my unconditional obedience.

I shall at all times be prepared

(to give my life for this oath.)

My dear wife.

I know you fear for me,

but my burden is light.

This is just a mistake.
A bureaucratic mess. You know?

When I compare my suffering

to that of other people,

IÂ´m a good person!

I see that mine
is the smallest of crosses.

It is horrible
what they have suffered.

and I donÂ´t want to know
what the fuck I've done,


but they've done bad things.
I don't want to be with these people!

You have to remember

what you knew in a better hour.

And every day it's like this!
Understand? Why me?

you son of a bitch?

Spring has come.

My three little girls
will already be

running barefoot,
picking flowers.

It would be better to tell them

where their father is
than to tell them stories.

The fresh green of the grass
is good for a person.

Someone with freedom
might not notice it.

Go on!

Get away from each other!

Greetings to Mother,
to you,

the girls and all.

See you again.

Dear husband.

Greetings in God,

who will make
everything right again.

Greetings from your
three little women.

They say to tell you only

about the good things
they're doing.

Of course.

But I wouldn't surprise you

by telling you
about their disobedience.

Ow!

I have to scold the girls.

They're always
demanding my attention.

Rosi's always asking about you.

When we are going to bed,

she says,

"Leave the door unlocked

so Papa can come in."

At meals,

"Save some for Papa."

She sang a song for you.

Wondered if you could hear.

Rosi wanted to take your picture
to bed with her tonight.

You were supposed
to sleep beside her.

I told her that when Father
comes home, he will.

Good night.

Warm greetings
from your loving wife,

Fani.

[Captain Herder:]
You may leave us alone.

Have a seat.

What good do you think
your defiance is doing anyone?

You think it will change
the course of things?

You think the authorities
are aware of you?

That your protests
will come to their attention?

Do you think anyone
will know of it? Ever hear?

No one knows what goes on
behind these walls. No one.

What purpose does it serve?

Does it make no difference

if this war is just or unjust?

You shine their shoes.

You fill their sandbags.

Are you innocent?

Who do you think you are?

What now?
What?... What?... What?

What is it?

Pride?

Are you better than the rest?

Are you alone wise?

How do you know
what is good or bad?

You know better than I?

Did heaven tell you this?

Heard a voice?

There's a difference,

between the kind of suffering
we can't avoid

and the suffering we choose.

Your hands! Your hands up!

You've forgotten
what the world looks like.

The light.

The sky.

I didn't make this world
the way it is.

And neither did you.

We all have blood on our hands.

No one is innocent.

Crime, bloodshed everywhere.

He who created this world...

he created evil.

Conscience makes cowards
of us all.

Take care, my friend.

The Antichrist is clever.

He uses a man's virtues...

to mislead him.

Dearest wife...

I leave for Berlin
at 10:13 A.M.

Have no concerns about me.

Pray for me.

Get in!

Look down.

Down.

Up.

Dear husband...

Your letter of May 7th
has arrived.

Many thanks.

The well went dry on Thursday.

We need a good rain.

What I feared has come.

I have found no one
to assist with the work,

except for Resie.

Strohofer stole beets
from our field.

I hear nothing
but your voice.

I visited the widow.

Maria.

She hadn't spoken with anyone
in two weeks.

The new hay gives me hope.

The scent in the barn.

The wind.

The wheat.

The sky.

He won't send us more
than we can bear.

Excuse me, can you tell me...

JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter

[Major Kiel:]
The Colonel must be consulted.

May I meet with him?

A busy man.

But phone, make an appointment.

I've tried to,

but my call isn't answered.

That surprises me.

The problem must be
on your side.

The telephone works
quite well up here.

Then...

how can I make an appointment?

You don't answer my letters.

It took me two days to get here.

It's a very difficult journey.

Out! Eveybody out!

You find it funny, uh?
Eyes on the floor!

...broken again!

Most beloved wife...

Once again, warm greetings
from your loving husband.

I'll write a few words,

just as they come from my heart.

Even though I am writing them
with bound hands,

it's still better than
if my will were bound.

Show me your hands.
Hold up your hands.

Do you understand me?

These men...

have no friends.

No loving hand to hold theirs.

What are you here for?

Treason.

They've seen sorrow.

Shame.

Destruction.

What strong hearts.

"Talking forbidden!"

Bausthulter. High treason.

JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter.
Undermining of military morale.

When you give up the idea

of surviving at any price...

a new light floods in.

Once you were in a rush...

always short of time.

Now you have all you need.

Once you never
forgave anyone...

judged people without mercy.

Now you see
your own weakness...

so you can understand
the weakness of others.

JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter!

Do you think...

I did this?

He used to be different.

He changed when he met you.

My dear children...

I thought of you especially,
Corpus Christi Sunday.

The bells ringing

over the fields.

I would have loved
to have seen you

with your crowns of flowers.

Your devoted father greets you,

from far away.

Traitors to the German cause!

We are under pressure,
because of what you did!

Shame on you!

You deserve...

to be executed!

Yeah, they should come here.
Yeah, they should hang you!

Dear husband...

Traitors to the German cause!

Loving greetings to you
on this Sunday.

We're all concerned about you.

Leave us alone!

Hopefully,

things are not going poorly.

The girls send greetings.

Loisi says they will give you
kisses together.

I'm always with you in thought.

I can go to Salzburg.

Papa offered to come with me.

Good morning.

Fear overcomes me.

I know it should not.

Trust in the triumph
of the good.

No evil can happen
to a good man.

Not a sparrow falls to Earth,

but he knows it.

I have no information.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

A father...

loves his child.

A father

wants his child to be happy.

For life not to touch her.

And you...

such a good child.

Franz, too.

Better to suffer injustice
than to do it.

[Attorney Feldman:]
I've been appointed by the court

to be your defense attorney.

As I understand,
your resistance is

specifically to serving
in combat.

But I believe if you were
to accept medical service,

you would work

as an orderly in a hospital,
that sort of thing.

They would probably
drop these charges.

Will I be required
to swear loyalty to Hitler?

Oh, words!

I mean, no one takes that
sort of thing seriously. Hmm?

I can't.

You are a stubborn man.

See here, I am going to
leave this paper with you.

Keep it with you.

Sign,

and you will go free.

But I am free.

So... why am I here?

I don't know.

You...

my shepherd.

You make me lie down
in green pastures.

[priest visiting prisoners]
Do you want to talk?

By the river of life.

You...

my strength.

You show me the path.

You...

our light.

Darkness is not dark to you.

Bring us to your eternal light.

To you.

The true.

The never-failing light.

You call me your brother.

Father.

To you I cry.

My rock.

My fortress.

I can do as I like with you.

Nobody would know.
Nobody would care.

Nobody'd lift a hand
to stop me.

Who sees us?

Give me strength.

To follow you.

Spirit...

Lead me.

Show me.

Lord...

You do nothing.

Where are you?

Why did you create us?

Have the persecuted

received the kingdom
of heaven?

The meek inherited
the earth?

The wise deceive us.

Afraid.

Oh...

I was once like you.

Confess it.

Your God has no pity.

He left us. Abandoned us.

Like he did your Christ.

His son!

How far we are
from having our daily bread.

How far from being delivered

from evil!

If we could only see
the beginning of his kingdom.

The dawn!

But...

Nothing.

Nothing ever!

Why give your life for them?

Quit talking and move along!

Your man died in vain.

He came.

And it was all for nothing.

We had 20 centuries
of failure.

We need a successful saint.

Oh, yeah.

No one will help us,

well, we do it on our own.

Sister?

Yes.

Come on.

Okay.

Yeah.

Dear wife,

I still can't say
how my future will unfold.

What comes next is
seldom better.

And still,
now begins the month of June.

The most beautiful month.

Nature does not notice
the sorrow

that has come over the people.

Though I cannot see much here,

I imagine that everything

is a more lovely green
than in past years.

At dawn,

we can hear blackbirds singing
loudly outside our windows.

They seem to have more freedom

and to know more of
peace and happiness,

though they are
only unreasoning animals

than we humans do.

We, who have the gift
of understanding.

You gave me back more
than I gave you.

I found a fellow here

from my training days.

Franz?

Franz!

Look at you.

What have you done?
You're a criminal!

He lifts the spirits
of the other fellows.

We're getting on just fine.

Good, bad, together.

He asks about our family.

Don't you worry.

Trouble lasts a day.

Yeah, eat. Eat. Eat.

Is that all you have?
Yeah.

Have you heard
of the Scharfrichter?

The one who chops off your head?

He's a very well-dressed man.

He comes and he has a...

a big hat.

He is a man of good taste.

He cuts your head,
but it's a clean cut,

and before
you can think a thought,

just...

I wonder how it feels.

Maybe your body's old,
your head is young,

and you see
your head flying away.

And your old arms...

they reach up

to the head.

And they're still in chains.

And you take this young head...

and you put it back
on your body.

And you open your eyes...

and the chains are gone!

But what happens then?

Maybe you'll see the moon.

Or the stars.

You know, even if it rains,

the sun is shining.

The sun

shines on good

and evil

the same.

There are more chains

than mad dogs.

I wish I'd had a wife.

And a farm.

And apple trees.

And a cherry tree.

And...

maybe some grapes.

We could do our own wine.

White wine.

And red wine.
One red wine for the winter.

And white wine for the summer.

We would not drink too much.

We would pray. And work.

But sometimes...

Sometimes, a little drink
is good.

Sometimes...

we would go to church.

And sometimes not. Sometimes...

we'd stay at home.

And we'd make music.

Franz JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter.

Driver at the headquarters of
the reserve motorized brigade in Enns.

Born on May 20th, 1907
in Radegund-on-the-Danube.

Currently in custody at the WerhrmachtÂ´s
preventive prison in Berlin-Tegel.

He refused again to comply with the
conscription laws of February 24th, 1935

regarding his active duty service
at the 17th motorized brigade in Enns.

The defendant failed to...

Do you have anything to say

in your defense?

Stop being so insolent!
Who do you think you are?

You are being a coward!
You're acting the martyr!

You rejected your duty, while all of us
fulfill our duties, to save your life!

We'll have
a short recess.

Come in.

Please, uh...

Sit down.

Thank you.

Do you imagine
that anything you do

will change
the course of this war?

That anyone outside this court
will ever hear of you?

No one will be changed.

The world will go on as before.

Your actions may even
have the opposite effect

of what you intend.

Someone else
will take your place.

Do you judge me?

I don't judge you.

I'm not saying,

"He's wicked.

I am right."

I don't know everything.

A man...

may do wrong.

And...

he can't get out of it.

To make his life clear.

Maybe... he'd like to go back
but he can't.

But...

I have this feeling
inside me...

...that I can't do

what I believe is wrong.

Do you have
a right to do this?

Do I have a right not to?

The judgment
of this court is...

death.

So today
they pronounced the sentence.

But they still

have to confirm it.

Sign the paper in your cell.

You'll go free.
I can work it out.

[Psalm 55]
Give ear to my prayer, O God;
Do not hide yourself from my pleas!

Attend to me, and answer me:
I am restless, and I mourn;

The wicked bring suffering on me; 
they assail me in anger.

My heart is in anguish within me;

The terrors of death,
fear and trembling have beset me.

"Dear father,
come soon!"

It's from his lawyer!

They've
condemned him to death.

I have to go to Berlin.

I'll come with you.

Franz!

You're doing no one any good.

No one.

This could be the last
opportunity to abandon this...

senseless position.

If you do...

Franz.

...I will at once
petition the court

to stay the execution
of your sentence,

but it must be done
without delay.

Do you understand?

Now.

I'm sticking
my neck out here.

This could jeopardize
my career...

my personal safety.

The charges would be dropped,
I'm sure, if you just...

change your stand.

I beg you to.

The war may soon be over.

You might...

You might never
have to face a situation

that would call on you
to do what you oppose.

My love.

Franz.

Don't you see what's coming?

There's not much time!

God doesn't care what you say,
only what's in your heart.

Say the oath
and think what you like.

Do you understand?

["Agnus Dei" by Wojciech Kilar]

I love you.

Whatever you do.

Whatever...

comes.

I'm with you.

Always.

Do what is right.

No! Let me go!

You said,

"Knock.

It will be opened.

Ask.

It will be given."

You've always been good to me.

And to my son.

And I've...

Forgive me!

You.

You love him more than I do.

Give him courage.

Wisdom.

Strength.

Father...

Tomorrow it will be done.

Thank you, Father.

[Henryk GÃ³recki: Symphony No. 3]

[Prosecutor reads charges]

Now, my dear children...

When mother
reads this letter to you,

your father will be dead.

Through God's grace
we'll soon meet again.

Dearest wife and mother...

It was not possible for me
to free you from the sorrows

that you've endured for me.

And now,

oh, my dear ones,

don't forget me
in your prayers.

I pray for you.

From the other side.

Faster!

Against the wall!

Move!

Sit down!    

What do I write?

Shh.

Next one!

Bring in the next one!


Our Father in heaven

Hallowed be your name

Your kingdom come

Your will be done

As in heaven,
so on earth

Give us our daily bread

Forgive us our guilt,
as we forgive those indebted to us

And lead us not into temptation

But deliver us from evil

Yours is the kingdom...

Next one!

JÃ¤gerstÃ¤tter!

Born on May 20th, 1907
in Radegund on-the-Danube.

From the prison of Berlin Tegel.

Scharfrichter!

Watch your step!

His death sentence was nullified in 1997
by a Berlin court.

After the war, a group of nuns
brought his ashes back to Sankt Radegund.

Franz was beatified in 2007.

Judge Lueben was asked to condemn three priests.
Instead he commited suicide in 1944.

A time will come
when we will know

what all this is for.

And there will be no mysteries.
We will know...

why...

we live.

We'll come together.

We'll plant orchards.

Fields.

We'll build the land back up.

Franz.

I'll meet you there.

In the mountains.
