RONNIE:
Yuck.

The fire's still warm.

Is that you, Hermit Bob?

We kinda can see you.

Farmer Miller says
you might have stole

one of his chickens.

That happens to be
against the law.

Now, I'm hoping that it was
a fox that did that.

HERMIT BOB: Up your hole
with a wooden pole, Cliff.

(BULLET STRIKES TREE)

That also happens to be
against the law.

Should we take him in?

Where'd he go?

CLIFF:
I don't know.

I don't see him.

Uh, we're gonna go back
to town now...

Hermit Bob.

Don't break any more laws.

Just calm down.

HERMIT BOB:
Hey, Cliff.

Fuck you.

("THE DEAD DON'T DIE"
BY STURGILL SIMPSON PLAYING)

â™ª Oh, the dead don't die â™ª

â™ª Any more than you or I â™ª

â™ª They're just ghosts
inside a dream â™ª

â™ª Of a life that we don't own â™ª

â™ª They walk around us â™ª

â™ª All the time â™ª

â™ª Never paying any mind â™ª

â™ª To the silly lives we lead â™ª

â™ª Or the reaping
we've all sown â™ª

â™ª There's a cup of coffee
waiting â™ª

â™ª On every corner â™ª

â™ª Someday we're gonna wake up â™ª

â™ª And find the corners gone â™ª

â™ª But the dead will still
be walking round â™ª

â™ª In this old world alone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on. â™ª

Should we bring him in
one of these days?

I mean...

he fired a weapon
at police officers.

Yeah, I don't know.

I doubt he even stole
that chicken.

Farmer Miller
is such an asshole.

I've known Bob
since junior high.

RONNIE:
Oh, wow.

That must have been
like 50 years ago.

CLIFF:
Yeah, it was.

You know, Bob's been out there
for years,

eating squirrels and bugs,

and he never hurt anyone
that I ever heard of.

Well, he is kind of unusual.

Is it already 20 after 8:00?

Shouldn't it be
getting dark by now?

Yeah, this
daylight savings thing

is all out of whack lately.

(DOG BARKING NEARBY)
(TAPPING WATCH)

Damn it.

My watch stopped.

Or is broken or something.

Yeah, something weird's
going on.

Yeah. Weird.

Yeah, this isn't gonna
end well, Cliff.

â™ª â™ª

The ant colonies.

All jacked up like it was
the end of the world.

Hey, Ronnie,
you want to swing by the diner,

get some doughnuts, coffee?

Um... (SIGHS) no, thanks.

It seems late
for coffee and doughnuts.

CLIFF:
I guess so.

(RADIO STATIC CRACKLES)
MINDY: This is home base.

Are you guys reading me?
Over.

Hey, Mindy.
You guys okay out there?

Yeah, we're just, uh,
cruising a bit

before we swing on back.

Uh, you need anything?

We could, uh, run by the diner,

pick you up
some coffee and doughnuts.

MINDY:
Negative. Thanks.

There is something strange
going on, though.

Have you guys, by any chance,
noticed that the...

(STATIC DRONES)
...and the daylight and the...

(STATIC CRACKLES, WHISTLES)
I think the news report...

(HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING)

Hello, hello.

Shit. We lost her.

Use your cell.

That's funny.

It's completely dead.

And it was fully charged.

Hey, Cliff, should we listen
to the civilian radio?

Sure. Go ahead.

(CYCLING THROUGH STATIONS)

("THE DEAD DON'T DIE"
BY STURGILL SIMPSON PLAYING)

â™ª Oh, the dead don't die â™ª

â™ª Any more than you or I â™ª

Wow, that sounds so familiar.

â™ª They're just ghosts
inside a dream... â™ª

What is that song, Ronnie?

It's "The Dead Don't Die."

By Sturgill Simpson.

Sturgill Simpson?

â™ª Never paying any mind
to the silly lives... â™ª

Why does it sound so familiar?

Well, 'cause it's
the theme song.

The theme song?
Yeah.

â™ª There's a cup of coffee
waiting â™ª

â™ª On every corner â™ª
(TURNS UP VOLUME)

â™ª Someday we're gonna wake up â™ª

â™ª And find the corners gone â™ª

â™ª But the dead will still
be walking round â™ª

â™ª In this old world alone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on â™ª

â™ª There'll be old friends
walking round â™ª

â™ª In a somewhat familiar town â™ª

(BIRD SQUAWKING)

â™ª That you saw once when
you looked up from the phone â™ª

(OVER RADIO):
â™ª Nobody bothers saying hi â™ª

(QUIET CHATTER)

â™ª And you can save
all your goodbyes â™ª

â™ª Stop trying to pretend â™ª

â™ª That we're all
not at home... â™ª

How much longer until
my takeout's ready, Fern?

Be out shortly, Frank.

Just heating it up for you.

Would you mind turning off
that goddamn music?

Fucking Sturgill Simpson.

(MUSIC STOPS)
Sure thing.

So, Frank,
what makes you so sure

it's Hermit Bob
who stole your chicken?

Well, who the hell else
could it be?

That goddamn hairy lunatic,

living out there
all these years like a caveman.

Like some kind of ghost.

Might as well be Amish.

Maybe it was a... a fox, Frank.

Um, I don't think
Bob ever hurt anybody.

Yeah, well, tell that
to my fucking chickens.

Fox, my ass.

Here you go, Frank.

Want me to put that
in a to-go cup for you?

Nah, I can't drink
any more of that stuff.

It's too damn black for me.

I meant it's too strong.

Take care, Frank.

Yeah.

POSIE (OVER RADIO):
This special report:

These activities
could possibly be affecting

the Earth's rotation
on its axis.

Scientists say
even the slightest change

in this balance
may already be causing

a dramatic change
in our usual hours of daylight.

Meanwhile,
government officials,

as well as the heads of
the energy companies involved,

say the recent extensive
polar fracking

has had no discernible
consequences whatsoever.

Here's what
the energy secretary had to say

in this evening's
press conference.

ENERGY SECRETARY: Listen, these
alarmists are dangerous liars.

Let's not believe something

just because one so-called
scientist says it's true.

Polar fracking has created
fantastic jobs,

big profits and energy
for our great country.

Let's not forget our priori...
(RADIO SHUTS OFF)

What you think, Fern?

I don't know, Hank.

Shouldn't it be
getting dark out?

â™ª â™ª

(INSECTS CHIRPING)

POSIE (OVER TV): So,
you can see from this diagram

that if the Earth is pulled
even slightly off its axis,

the repercussions
could be extreme.

Coming up
in the next segment...

(TV SHUTS OFF)

Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

A change in the Earth's
rotation or its spin rate?

That'd be catastrophic,
for sure.

All the cycles of the biosphere
would be affected.

The natural cycles of sunlight
would be disrupted,

plants wouldn't grow,
wind patterns would change,

and tectonic activity...

Forget about it.

The polar caps shifting
would mean...

I don't want to say.

Total planetary destruction.

For real?

Shut up.

(DOOR OPENS)

GUARD:
Okay, time's up, girls.

Way up.

Well, if it isn't Geronimo
on the girls' floor again.

Do you want to be a girl,
Geronimo?

No.

Well, then get back
to the boys' section... now.

Dennis.

Can you please escort Geronimo
back to the boys' section?

I'll deal with these girls.

Let's go, Geronimo.
You know the drill.

Let's go, you clowns.

It's bedtime for bozos.

You two ladies, too.
Let's go.

(OVER TV): Secretary of Energy
Pillerton, however...

(STATIC WARBLING)
GUARD: Thank you.

...fully refutes
these speculations,

insisting...
(STATIC DRONING)

TEEN BOY: See you, Bobby.
(MUSIC PLAYS OVER RADIO)

YOUNG BOY: Excellent.
You got it? Need a bag?

No, thanks.
All right.

Bye, Bobby.
See you guys.

TEEN BOY:
Wow, it's still so light out.

Okay. So...

Bilbo Baggins.
Hey, Dean.

What's up, buddy?
How's things?

After-hours delivery, WU-PS.

Check this out.

Got some
<i>Weird News of the World.</i>

The Earth off its axis.

That's bad news.

This is for you right here,
for your collection.

Oh, man. <i>Starlog.</i>

<i>Eerie.</i>

<i>Creepy,</i> number 61.
(DEAN CHUCKLES)

April 1974.

That motherfucker's rare,
before you was born and shit.

Oh, man. Here, let me
give you some money.

No, that's on me.

Add it to your collection.
Thanks, man.

Just give me
your Herbie Hancock right here,

and I'll be on my way.

They need to fix the AC.

You know, it's kind of hot
in this motherfucker, huh?

All right.

Okay-dokay.

All right,
see you next week, Frodo.

Hey, Dean.

I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind just, uh,

dropping a little wisdom
until the next delivery.

The world is perfect.

Appreciate the details.

BOBBY (WHISPERS):
"The world is perfect.

Appreciate the details."

HERMIT BOB:
You guys shouldn't be here.

(CROW CAWING IN DISTANCE)

Strange.

Tasty porcinis.

Okay.

(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

(TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

(CLEARS THROAT)

Mmm.

Kitty!
(NEWS THEME PLAYS)

POSIE (OVER TV):
Good evening.

This is Posie Juarez.

We interrupt this program

for a Centerville 7 News
Special Report.

People are saying their pets
have either just disappeared

or are acting unusually
skittish and aggressive.

Here's a report
from Harrisville.

WOMAN:
Look at this.

I mean, I just couldn't find
my cat, Rainbow.

And when I finally did
find her,

she was under the house.

She's never done that before.

She's not usually like that.

She's very gentle and...

That's so strange.
Where are you guys?

(OVER TV): ...too, and she had
this wild look in her eye,

and when I finally tried
to pull her out,

she scratched me all to shreds,
like a wild animal.

That's so creepy.
I knew...

We're back?

Hello. (CHUCKLES)

Wow, that is strange, and it
seems to be happening all over.

We'll have more reports
at 11:00.

But for now,
this is Posie Juarez

for Centerville 7 News.

Stay safe...
(STATIC DRONES)

and keep your eyes open.

FRANK:
Rumsfeld.

Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

Where the hell are you?


Goddamn dog.

(DOG PANTING)
(CROWS CAWING)

Rumsfeld? You out here?

Rumsfeld,
what you doing over there?

Get your ass inside.

(PANTS, WHINES)

Come on, stupid.
(BARKING)

Hey.

What are you doing?

(PANTS, WHIMPERS)

Goddamn it.

Holy shit.

Who stole my fucking cows?

Where the hell are my chickens?


HERMIT BOB:
Frank's cows.

Into the woods, ladies.

Welcome to my world.

CLIFF:
Damn it, Mallory.

Even dead,
you reek of chardonnay.

Cheap chardonnay.

(CROW CAWING IN DISTANCE)

How's she looking?

Well, she's not getting
any older.

Wow.
The diner sure makes

the world's best coffee,
doesn't it?

Yeah, but how can you
drink it so late?

Won't it keep you up?
No, I sleep like a baby.

Except maybe when I know
there's a corpse

waiting for me at work.

Oh, y-yeah.

Cliff, is the coroner
from Latrobe

gonna pick her up tomorrow?

It's getting a little creepy
being here alone

with Mallory decomposing
in there.

Yeah, they're supposed to come
pick her up tomorrow morning.

MINDY:
Thank God.

I don't know why she can't be
over at the funeral home.

CLIFF: 'Cause she's going
to Potter's Field in Latrobe.

And 'cause our new
unusual undertaker,

Ms. Winston,
has got those two golfers

that were struck by lightning...
the Logans.

(MINDY CLEARS THROAT)

Thanks, Ronnie.

It's not really necessary,
but...

Can I, uh,
drive you home, Mindy?

Also not necessary, Ronnie.
You know I have my car here.

Oh, yeah.

How is the Prius running?
Fine.

Can you even fit two people in
that little Smart car of yours?

Well, yeah.
Holds two nicely.

CLIFF: This daylight thing
is bothering me.

It's strange.

MINDY:
Well, what can I say?

The world is
kind of strange lately.

Yeah, it sure is.

If you ask me, this whole thing
is gonna end badly.

So, what exactly do you mean,
Ronnie?

Oh, uh, don't know.

Just a feeling, I guess.

Strong feeling.

Oh, boy.

You okay doing the whole
night shift alone, Cliff?

Yeah, I can take a nap.

I mean, I can just lie down
in that other cell

next to old Mallory.

MINDY:
Oh, God.

Next to her... her dead body?

Might bring back
some old memories.

See you guys tomorrow.

See you, Cliff.
Yeah, see you tomorrow, Chief.

CLIFF:
"This is all gonna end badly."

What does that mean?

I knew Mallory O'Brien
since I was a kid.

And believe it or not,

sh-she was
a pretty young thing, too.

Please.
(LAUGHING)

Sorry, but good riddance
to that drunken old goat.

Well, I-I-I don't know, Fern.

Geez, I got to get up
out of here.

I-I got to, uh, get
to the hardware store

early tomorrow morning.

I'm looking forward
to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

Mm.
Take care, Hank.

Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.
(DOOR OPENS)

Hank is such a gentleman.
(DOOR CLOSES)

Sure is.

get started cleaning here.

Listen, Lily.

I've been dying to ask you
about that new foreign woman

that took over
the funeral home.

What's her name?

Her name is Zelda Winston.

And she's strange, for sure.

And she's got these, like,
really weird eyes,

like she's, like,
looking right through you.

She pays me really well,
though.

Zelda. What-what kind
of name is that?

I don't know.

She's probably, like, Irish
or Scottish or whatever.

And she talks
really funny, though,

so I don't always get it right.

But I like the name Zelda.

It reminds me of, um,
Zelda Fitzgerald.

Who's that?

That's Great Gatsby's wife.

And who's that?

That's the really rich guy
from the 1920s.

The Robert Redford guy.

Well, anyway,
so what's it like over there

in those secret rooms
since she took over?

Well, there's these, like,
really creepy back rooms,

you know, where they, like,
keep all the stiffs.

And then next to that,
there's this big golden Buddha.

A what, now?

There's a big, shiny,
golden Buddha.

And then there's these, like,

old-looking samurai swords
on a rack.


Really?

(GASPING, RUSTLING)


(PANTING QUIETLY)

What is it, Liv?

You okay?

Yeah.

I guess so.

I just got this creepy feeling.

You were probably just
having a bad dream.

Yeah, guess so.

A bad dream.

It's okay.
Just go back to sleep.

Thanks, Stell.

I'm out of here, Lil.

Okay, Fern.
See you tomorrow.

Not if I see you first.

Very funny.

Excuse me, we're closed.

What... what happened to you?

Aah! Lily!

This is Chief Robertson.

Hi, Hank. What's up?

Is it really 6:30?

What?

At the diner?

(TIRES SQUEAL)

(QUIET CHATTER)

Uh, like I said
on the phone, Cliff,

often, Fern gets here early,
and so I thought I might

get some coffee to go,
and-and then this.

Oh, my God.

I-I saw them.

Fern and Lily.

Oh, man.

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS)

Uh, wh-what the hell was it?

A wild animal?
Uh, several wild animals?

I don't know.

But whatever it was,
it even smashed the coffeepots.

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

(QUIET CHATTER)

â™ª â™ª

Oh, yuck.

Jesus Christ, Cliff.

What the heck was it,
a wild animal?

Several wild animals?

That's exactly what I said.

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

(QUIET CHATTER, SOBBING)

Hey, guys.

Wow. Fern's really done wonders
with these flower beds.

Really perks up the place, huh?

What?

What happened?
God, Mindy.

I don't think
you want to see this.

â™ª â™ª

Uh, no, no, I didn't need
to see that.

Was it a wild animal?

Or several wild animals?

Cliff, is that really
Fern and Lily in there?

CLIFF:
Uh, no.

That was Fern and Lily,
but now...

Do you need me here?

Maybe you could help out
with crowd control.

Okay, folks, can you move it
along now, please?

(WOMAN SOBBING)
Thank you.

I can't believe it.

You... you really want to know?

I'm thinking zombies.

What?

You know, zombies.

Ghouls. The undead.

Are you...

you're trying to tell me...

...you're thinking
zombies did this?

Yup.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Jack,
will you check your phone

and see where we are exactly?
Yeah.

Oh, man.

I'm not getting
any reception out here.

Geez, I don't even know
if my phone's working,

for some reason.
ZACK: Hmm.

Let me try the radio.

(STATIC WARBLING)

Oh, wow,
it's working again, so...

MAN (OVER RADIO): I mean,
they're absolutely wrong.

We know very well
that polar fracking

has been great
for this country.

In my opinion, these naysayers

should just move
to somewhere else

where they don't have to...
I'm not listening to this.

(CYCLING THROUGH STATIONS)

â™ª And the streets
look so empty â™ª

â™ª In the morning â™ª

"The Dead Don't Die."

I love this song.

â™ª There'll be no one

â™ª For the lights
to shine down on â™ª

â™ª But the dead will still
be walking round â™ª

â™ª In this old world alone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on â™ª

â™ª Hearts break â™ª

â™ª When loved ones journey on â™ª

â™ª So we tell ourselves â™ª

â™ª They're all still

Thanks.

â™ª Gone but not forgotten â™ª

â™ª Just memories left behind â™ª

Oh, shit, you guys.
We have to stop and get gas.

Look. Gas sign right there.

â™ª But the dead will still
be walking round â™ª

â™ª In this old world alone... â™ª
(WIND WHISTLING)

Okay, cool.
Come back soon, okay?

See you, Bobby.

Stay sick, guys.
Turn blue, Bobby.

JACK:
Hey, kids, how's it going?

Eat me.

Whoa, this place is a trip.

Sure is.

Oh. Hi.

Hi.

Nice shirt.

<i>Nosferatu.</i>
Yeah.

It's really cool.

Thanks. I make 'em.

How about that?
Earth off its axis.

End of the world.
Mm.

Flesh-eating zombies.

You get a lot of zombies
around here?

That depends, I guess.

Uh, so... so, about the gas.

You want to pay cash or credit?

Here you go, Frodo.

Cool. Thanks.

Uh, did you, uh...

Did you just call me Frodo?

Did I?

Hey, is there a motel in town?

(GASPS)
Yeah, there is one

just down the...
ZOE: Ooh.

BOBBY:
Oh, that's a really good CD.

Sturgill Simpson,
"The Dead Don't Die."

Yeah, I know.
I love this song.

Is it nice?

What?
The motel.

Oh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's kind of cool.

It's one of those
old-school ones.

ZACK: Like in old-school
horror movies,

with, like... like in <i>Psycho</i>
with the separated bungalows?

Uh, the Bates Motel in <i>Psycho</i>

was not separated into
"little bungalows."

Ooh.
(SIGHS) All right.

That's 12 for the CD
and two dollars for the soda.

Here you go. You can just keep the change.
Thanks.

Oh, cool.

JACK: Whoa.
(ZOE LAUGHING)

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

That's a super cool ride,
by the way.

Very, uh, George Romero.

Yeah, it's a classic.

Your film knowledge
is impressive.

What's your name?

What's that?
Bobby Baggins?

No, Wiggins.

I'm Zoe.

It's... it's really weird.

I see.

But Miss O'Brien...

so she has to stay with us
another night?


Okay. Thank you.

Hello, Ms. Winston.

Hello,
Officer Minerva Morrison.

Do call me Zelda.

Yeah, okay, sure.

You've been informed
of the tragedy?

I have.

Am I to understand
that the remains

will be brought to
The Ever After Funeral Home

for my preparations?

Uh, no,
that won't be necessary.

The Feds have already
collected the remains.

They've brought them
out of the county.

I see.

â™ª â™ª

(QUIET EXHALE, SHEET RUSTLES)

Is there anything else
I can do?

Yes.

I do have
an unrelated question.

Shoot.
"Shoot"?

I mean ask me.

Oh, yes.

Are you, by any chance,
a couple?

You and the physically
attractive one?

Um, you mean the younger one?

Officer Peterson?

That's the one I mean...
Officer Ronald Peterson.

Well, actually, no.

Why do you ask, Zelda?

Just accumulating
local information.

Oh.

Okay.

Dear Jesus.

I mean, that's
absolutely horrible.

I mean, who or what is-is-is

per-perpetrating
these... these...

Hey.

What's going on?
Hey.

Nice car.

'68 Pontiac LeMans.

JACK:
Yeah. It's a beauty, huh?

It's our friend's
totally rad ride.

It's a classic.

Have a good one.

ZACK:
Later.

ZOE:
Guys, I'm so hungry.

ZACK:
Same. Let's eat.

I'll ask. H-Hey.

Nice car.
Thank you.

Uh, do you guys know if there's
a diner or restaurant nearby?

CLIFF:
Sorry.

The only diner in town
is closed, indefinitely.

Well, that's unfortunate.

Uh, but we, uh, have
several vending machines

containing snacks, uh,
right over by the office.

Okay. Thanks.

Do you have change
for three dollars?

Yeah, I do.

I like your badge.

Oh, th... thank you.

That's, uh...

(COINS CLINKING)

That-that should be good.
Oh, okay.

Thanks.
Oh, no, no.

You can, you can have it.
Yeah?

Okay. Thanks.

They just checked in.

Hipsters from the big city.

Yeah?
Yep.

My educated guess
would be Pittsburgh.

They got that urban style,
you know.

Oh, well, those plates
are from Ohio,

so my educated guess
would be Cleveland.

Oh. Cleveland. Hmm.
(ZOE SIGHS)

CLIFF:
Yeah, Cleveland.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah. Thanks.

That girl's part Mexican.
(DOOR CLOSES)

Hmm?
Really?

How can you tell?

I have an affinity
for Mexicans.

They're, like,
my favorite people.

I love Mexico.
I've been down there twice.

Okay, Ronnie,

then you should be the one
to inform them

that if they're gonna spend
the night in Centerville,

to not go out and to keep
their hotel room door locked.

Okay?

Uh, you know, Cliff, uh...
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

I know this isn't important
comparatively, uh,

but, uh, all of my cats are gone.
(DOOR OPENS)

And-and, normally, they-they,
uh, just stay inside.

(QUIET CONVERSATION)

Well, I'm sorry
about that, Danny.

They could be hiding.


Nothing is happening normally
right now.

Yeah.
How did they react?

They said, "I heard you had
a lot of zombies around here,"

and then they laughed.

sounds like the start of

Sure does.

GERONIMO: Boo! (LAUGHS)
(STELLA AND OLIVIA GASP)

Really, really not funny,
Geronimo.

You guys hear about those
grisly murders at the diner?

Yeah.
Just talking about them.

Creepy.

I've been listening
to the radio,

and I'm sure
it's the undead, yo.

Reanimated by the Earth
being thrown off its axis

from the polar fracking.

What are you saying?

I'm saying...

full-on
zombie apocalypse, baby.

Soon, there'll be
hordes of them.

Shit.

Do you want to lose

No, sir.

Then let's go.

RONNIE: Cliff,
why'd they used to separate

the children's graves
from the adults'?

Don't know.

Some kind of
a 19th-century thing.

RONNIE:
Huh.

Seems like a bad idea somehow.

Yeah. So, what exactly are we
looking for here? Zombies?

(CLIFF YELPS)


Hey, look over here.

Here's another one.

Oh, man.
This isn't gonna end well.

â™ª â™ª

(CAR DOORS CLOSE)

This is undead, reanimated,

No question.

I was supposed to retire.

Two years ago.
RONNIE: I know.

Why didn't you?
What?

Retire two years ago.

Are we improvising here?

No, I was just asking.

But I probably know
the answer anyway.

Probably. Yeah.

So, is our plan
to continue to inform people

about the zombie danger
before it gets dark?

Oh, God, Ronnie.

Uh... I guess so.

Because we passed
Farmer Miller's place

a little while ago.
Do we need to inform him?

Fuck Farmer Miller.

Really?

He is a citizen of Centerville.

You're right. Uh...

We'll have Mindy call him.

Oh, okay.

So, Ronnie, how the fuck
do you kill a zombie?

Well, you got to kill the head.

"Kill the head."
Yeah.

By any means necessary,
kill the head.

Decapitate.
It's the only way to kill them.


And that's really the only way
to stop zombies,

is to kill the head, Hank.

I know it's gruesome,
but complete decapitation.

Doesn't matter if you use
a-a machete, steel wire,

hedge clippers, whatever.

Just as long as the spinal cord
is severed, right?

And the head... is cut off.
(RUMMAGING)

And that's it.
De-animated.

Only way to kill the dead:

kill the head.

Uh, wait, Bobby.

I-I'm not so sure
it was zombies.

You said they ate
Lily and Fern's flesh.

Usually, they go for
the brains.

It's unusual, but...

it's still cannibals, man.

HANK:
Mm.

Definitely zombies.

Okay?

Hank, you can trust me.

I've seen almost every
zombie film ever made.

HANK:
Mm.

This is zombie shit going down,
and we got to get prepared.

I don't know
what to think anymore.

(HANK CHUCKLES, MUTTERS)

Oh, yeah.

(HANK GRUNTS)

Yeah, you're right.

Just kill the head.

Several other shocking

(FAUCET RUNNING)

occurred in this

the victims were attacked

We went by the hardware store.

You know what happens.

Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby
from the gas station

have locked themselves in
over there.

They tried to convince
other citizens to join them,

but with no success.

Why? What's happening?

Is it some sort
of epidemic or what?

It's zombies.

What are you saying?
Well, it's the undead.

They've been reanimated.

Caused by the Earth having been
pulled off its axis,

caused by the polar fracking.

But the authorities
and energy people

keep saying that's not true.

Really?


Oh, my God.

â™ª Hearts break â™ª

â™ª When loved ones journey on â™ª

â™ª At the thought â™ª

â™ª That they're now
forever gone â™ª

â™ª So we tell ourselves
they're all still â™ª

â™ª Around us all the time â™ª

â™ª Gone but not forgotten â™ª

â™ª Just memories left behind â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª But the dead will still
be walking round â™ª

â™ª In this old world alone â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on â™ª

â™ª 'Cause after life is over â™ª

â™ª The afterlife goes on. â™ª
