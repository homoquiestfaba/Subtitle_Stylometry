A lot of them won't cross State Street.
Mm-hmm.

I need everyone knocking on doors,

We don't get these kids in here,
I got to start cutting positions.

They won't give me my damn check.


Listen to the announcements.

Nobody's getting paid this week.

Downtown messed up payroll again.

I'm gonna need something to hold me over.

When am I going to get my nine back?

Not the next time I get paid,

That's what happened.

You went into a student's room

Hey, hey, hey, hold up.
You're making it sound inappropriate.

It was.

The kid is incredible.

All right, he's some type of...

He would hit all the vocals on the C.

Like, middle C.

Then he'd put the drums
on the lower octave of the C,

then the bass line he'd put on the D.

Right? Then he would just...

Kept moving around
on the melodies and shit, man.

I know I'm probably
talking Japanese to you.

Nah. Nah, nah, nah.

I'm straight.
Okay.

RZA, he never had Froot Loop shit like

Nah, he did everything with one hand,
and at the same time.

He had them niggas rhyme
into his keyboard,

and it had to be perfect,

Here. Grab that. Come on, man.

Say something.

This shit dumb, bro.

This shit dumb?

Let me tell you something, man.

Since the beginning of time, men have been
doing dumb shit to get a woman.

All it takes is one good song

to override all this hermit shit
you got going on.

<i>â™ª Don't need a whole lot of love â™ª</i>

Hey, hey, hey, why you whispering?

I told you I don't know
how to do this shit.

Okay, okay, okay, okay, calm down.
All right, August?

Just relax, breathe.

Let's hear what you got.

[HIP HOP TRACK PLAYING]

<i>â™ª Don't need a whole lot of love â™ª</i>

Oh, come on.

August, you got to do it

So, when you gonna give it to her?

Hey. Man, I, uh...

Nah, I'm straight.

Come on, man. I got somebody

This is next-level time.

August, I mean,

Man, can't we just keep doing

Come on, we got an album
full of hits, August.

Let me be who I'm supposed to be, dog.

Man up.

So, what, you're gonna post up in here,

See how well that shit goes over

Nothing better out there."

You know, it's hard to prove
that hypothesis

when you never left Chicago.

Yeah. I ain't never been nowhere.

I got family in Detroit,

Man, lot of people ain't never
been downtown, let alone Detroit.

Hey.

Let me holler at you.

You... You wanna do this now?

Yeah, where else, nigga?

Look, man, you get ten percent

plus you get reimbursed
for the studio time.

Ten percent?

That's a hell of a deal
coming out the gate, man.

Imagine how big Cabrini's gonna be.

Man, you take that one hit song and

We own the label, man. I did it before.

I'mma do it right this time.

Believe that.

This the proper way. Try it.

Told you. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

That show was so dope. I mean...

Who'd have thought?
Cabrini killed that joint, and...

I was very happy to hear my song.

You, uh, ever had a palm reading?

It's like your whole destiny
is already written...

right here.

Your heart's beating quick.

I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

Must be a panic attack.

I get those.


No one's ever gonna accuse your ass
of being smooth, August.

Prom coming up.

You going?

I don't really do those type of things.

Why you got to be so goofy, August?

Yes, this man took my kid
without asking permission.

Niyah, are you okay?

Okay. Look,
I didn't do anything wrong, all right?

The hell you didn't!

Officer, she's overreacting.

What are you doing with my son?

Answer me!

I took him to a party
that he wanted to go to. Shit!

You keep him locked up all day
like he's a fucking felon.

Motherfucker! I will break your ass!


Get the fuck off of me!

That is my son!
Stand where you are!

On your knees!
Ma!

It's all unnecessary!
She didn't do anything!

Be quiet! Okay?
Okay!

I told you to calm down!
What the fuck did I do, man?

Stop resisting!
[GRUNTS] I'm not resisting!

Mom! Ma!
[GROANING]

We didn't doing nothing, man!
Be quiet!

Fuck you!
Shut up!



[CROWS CAWING]

What was it? Three hundred something?

Well, now that you got
all that Uber money, I mean, shit.

I should've told you about August sooner,
but it all just happened so sudden.

You are a staff member that I hired.

He is a student.
How do you think that makes me look?

He wasn't smoking, he wasn't drinking,
he was just out having a good time.

His mother could sue the school.

Come on.
She just had you arrested.

You know what?
As a matter of fact, this is my fault,

for believing that hustle
about you needing this damn job.

But I did need it.

Always looking for something shinier.

I'm a high school rent-a-cop.

Zero shine to that, trust me.
Mm.

Vanessa, this kid is our way back in.

I'm really trying to help these kids,

and you out here
trying to get rich off of 'em.

Hey, Vee, that is not...
Don't fucking touch me.

I'm about a second away
from busting you in your damn mouth.

Just sign the damn papers.

Vanessa, come on.
Stop playing this house shit.

I just took the boy to a block party!

Really?

[CAR ENGINE STARTING]

So, you're just gonna
leave me standing here, huh?

I wasn't trying to be disrespectful, Mom.

No one loves you more than me.

You know that, right?

And you know that I need you.

It's just you and me now.

I just thought we was...
[POUNDS TABLE]

What?

You thought you'd be back
before I got home?

I got to be able to trust you
in this house.

Everybody liked the song
that me and Romelo made.

And...

Niyah was there.

Oh, Niyah?

Oh. So you got your nose open now.

Is that why you acting so crazy?

Oh, you think you're grown now, okay.

I mean, you're making decisions
that affect this house,

so you must think you grown.

All I did was go to a party.

And kids get killed at parties every day.

I wasn't even thinking about that.
Well, I know that's right.

If something had happened to you,
August...

Anything could've happened to you.

But it didn't.
And... Don't.

Don't you make it seem like
I'm the crazy one.

I got to go to work.

She's right.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]


I bought gyros.

I can't.

Come on, last night didn't end right.
All right?

But we got real momentum, August.
We got to keep moving on that.

Damn, man.

You just don't get it.

I should've never let you
talk me into all this stuff.

My mom, she...
Hey, look, hey, hey, August,

we got to keep moving on that, all right?

She'll get over it, man, trust me.

We can't stop the creative process, man,
look, because...

[DOOR LOCKING]

You ever played billiards before?

She called it pool. I thought
maybe she was swinging. I wasn't sure.

[CABRINI] Guys, kill the noise.
[TERRENCE] Okay.

I'm saying we got to start
that cross-branding shit.

We got to brand you, get that drink,

the... the Cabrini Martini,
you know what I'm saying?

What's going on in here?


Sitting back thinking about
how you did Tone.

That was grimy as shit, bro.
You don't know nothing about that.

The karma not right.

You got to work on that redemption.

Mister, what did you do?

What'd I do?

Ten percent?

Of your ten percent?

That's the best I could get?

Me?
Yeah, nigga.

[MISTER SCOFFS]
It ain't nothing personal, Ro.

You still my dog.

It's just business.

Terrence, come on, man. What the fuck
is going on? She is my artist.

It's what homegirl said.
It's nothing personal, man.

Come on, Mister. You know
I'm trying to get this shit right again.

Trying to get this shit...
Romelo, she's too big for you, dog.

What?

Dog, you had to come beg me
to let her open for free.

Hey. Terrence, fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!

I came to you with
a motherfucking deal, man!

I put hard work into this shit, man!

You're not doing none of that. Back up.

Can't let you put your hands
on my partner like that.

Your partner?
Back up. My partner.

Oh.

We both know you would've
fucked this up, man.

Okay.

Fuck you.

Hey, man, it is what it is.
Cabrini's part of the Ill Note family now.

But you do recognize talent.

Yo, what about that, uh,
that producer kid, what's his name?

Austin?


Let's do business.


What's up, man, how you been?
Like you give a fuck.

So, what you say to her?

What?
Niyah.

She ain't talking to me.
I heard you and her been kicking it.

So I know you sneak dissin' on me.

I didn't say nothing about you.
Bullshit.

I ain't step to her all last year
because of you,

and now we talking,
and you just wanna pop back up?

That's some bitch-ass shit.

Why she like your fat ass anyway?

Unless you're fucking with me?

She like me.


my homie, nigga!

Man, why you got that here?

I wasn't gonna dead your ass.
I always got it.

But you don't need it.

How the fuck you gonna tell me
what I need?

I'm out there doing what I got to do,
and your ass up here not doing shit!

You gonna be there when I need you?

Huh?

You gonna have my back?

That's what the fuck I thought.

I better not catch your ass
on the block again,

'cause I promise you
it won't be no words next time.

Fake-ass bucket boy.



[WOMAN] Three, two, one.
[LAUGHTER]

Dab.


Where you at, August?

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING]

Girl, come on, just forget about him.

Don't worry about it.
I promise you, I'm good,

I'll text you, all right?
All right.

I love you, girl!
I ain't playing! You better be there!

[PHONE CHIMES]

Coming down, Romeo?

I can't tonight.

Tonight?

If not now, when?

I don't know.

Stop acting like a little bitch!

It ain't even like that.
That's exactly what it is.

Your ass scared.

Got to make shit good again.

The hell is wrong with you, August?

This Chicago.

Both my brothers is dead,
and I'm standing here!

I'm outside!

My moms need me.

You wrote me that song.

You took me to that show.

You got me standing outside
in this itchy-ass dress,

and you can't even come out
the damn house, nigga?

You embarrassed me in front of my friends!

Lose my number.

Niyah.

You gonna have more fun
without me tonight.

Fuck you.

[PIANO NOTES PLAYING]

August.

August, what did you... What... Baby?

What are you doing? What is it?

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

It's okay. It's okay.

I just wanna be normal.

[KARI'S VOICE VOCALIZING]

[VOCALIZING CONTINUES]

[DOOR BUZZER BUZZING]

[MS. MONROE] <i>Who is it?</i>

Romelo.

Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my son?

<i>I didn't come here for that.
I came to talk to you.</i>

"You should've ran it by me first"?

That's your apology?

Hm. I'm not apologizing,
just explaining what happened.

Hell, I'm the one who went to jail.

You ever ask yourself why a grown-ass man
is hanging out with a teenager?

I'm just trying to show August
the bigger life. You know, he needs...

No, don't talk to me
about what my son needs.

He needs friends.

He needs a purpose.

No, he needs to make it
to his 18th birthday.

Your son is very talented.

Not too many people can do what he can.

He can do big things in this world,
but he's got to be in the world.

Listen.

Come on, take a listen.

That's your son.


[HIP HOP TRACK PLAYS FAINTLY ON EARBUDS]

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

Goddamn.

What happened?

I can't do music no more.

You didn't have to get
all dramatic with it.

Hey, you know...

it's time to upgrade you anyway.

I got a...

got a plug that can give us free codes
to Pro Tools.

I don't know if I did it
'cause I liked it...

or I do it 'cause she liked it.

Who?
My sister.

She used to find the most...

random samples.

They killed her.

Yeah, I heard.

Fucking playground on Perry.

I never even heard the bang...

It just burned.


And buried itself right here.

Man, she ain't even do nothing.

Just came and got me for dinner.

I'm sorry, man.

I can't do this no more.

My moms, she need me.

Man, like I said, y'all ain't gonna
even be around here no more.

What you mean?

You gonna move your momma
out of here, man.

You're gonna be a hero.

Got you a record contract.

<i>I think you might need this, man.</i>

<i>All right, let me see that over here.</i>


<i>â™ª Every time I come alive

<i>You know what?
I trust this nigga with my life, man.</i>

<i>He keep it 100 at all times.</i>

<i>Man, nigga, you crazy.</i>

<i>that's shit you wouldn't pocket.</i>

<i>Go on, nigga, I know you got one more.
Go ahead, spit that shit, dog.</i>



We need to talk.
It's 2:00 in the morning.

I'm a mess without you, babe.
Take your drunk ass somewhere.

I'mma take my drunk ass in the middle
of the street and scream your name

so all your neighbors know it.

Vanessa!

<i>â™ª I'm not going nowhere
'Cause I'm home â™ª</i>

There's a reason why
that's in a to-go cup.

First things first.

I'm not signing those papers.

Things have changed.

I'm me again.

Romelo...
No.

Got a deal at Ill Note Records.

I'mma take care of us.

Just stop.

Yeah, gonna take a while
to finesse, but...

they want August.

Hm.

With Terrence?

Mm-hmm.

I told you not to bring that boy
into your shit.

You know how he operates.

It's not going to be like that
this time, okay?

I'm doing this for the kid, and, hell...

I'm doing this for us.

Is that what you're doing?

Yeah.

Hey.

Where's our wedding pictures?

I put 'em away.
Look.

Everybody gets fucked a little
on their first contract,

but I'll be here to help the kid
get started in the business.

You think I'mma tell you that it's okay
for you to fuck over a 17-year-old kid?

I'm not absolving you of that, Romelo.

Goddamn, Vee.

Why you still acting like I ain't shit?

'Cause you ain't shit.

Oh, my God.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

You're such a fucking idiot.

[ROMELO GROANS]

I never gave a damn
about your fucking deals, Romelo.

Shit changes.

This is my chance to get back on top.

Romelo, you are doing this for you.

This ain't for me.

I need you to get out my house, Romelo.

I need you to get
the fuck out of my house.

This our house.

Get the fuck out of my house!


[MS. MONROE] I got this...

for you.

Come here.

I thought you should maybe go in there...

looking professional. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

You know you ain't have to take off work.

You are signing a record deal, okay?

There's no way I was gonna miss that.

Thanks, Mom.

You're welcome.

You both ended up looking like your daddy.




August, you know we don't have to do this
if you don't want to, right?

Yes, we do.

[DOOR BUZZER BUZZING]

[BEEPS]
We on our way down.

Uh, I'm not sure what Ro told you
about this place, but...

it's a home.
It's a home for artists like August.

And we're inviting him into our home, man.

We want you to be a part of our family,
for a long, long time.

Ordinarily, it would take, like,

four weeks to kinda issue a check
and lick the stamp and send it out.

But you know, I'mma make a call,
get you that check in two weeks.

How does that sound, big dog?

You hear that, Ma?

We're gonna move.

All right.

Ms. Monroe.

You're up first.

Um...

Hey, my lawyer looked everything over
and it's all good, so...

all you have to do is sign.

There you go.

August.


I don't got to tell this guy twice.
No.

Damn.

just like me.

Beautiful.
Now we celebrate. That's what's up.

[MS. MONROE] That... That's it?
Yeah. That's it.

All right. Watch out now. Watch out now.

[CORK POPS]
Boom.

There we go. King Monroe, Ms. Monroe.

Soda pop for you, August.

Hey, Romelo, you want the bubbly
or do you want something brown, man?

If you don't tell me, I'm just gonna have
to pour you something, dealer's choice.

Jesus.

[LIGHTER LID CLICKS]

Yo, what the hell are you doing?
My contract!

You don't need that. It was fucked.

What are you talking about?

The song goes to number one,
he doesn't even sniff a royalty check.

Stop talking right now. Stop talking.

Why'd you do that?
My moms needed that money.

We can get the money some place else,
big man.

I'm gonna litigate the fuck out of you.
Do it.

I told you not to get in his head.

Nah, forget the contract,
that shit's burned.

Hey.
Romelo, I just gave you 40 grand, man.

Wait, what?
Did you already forget that?

I'm not touching this money.

Why he give you that money for my music?
Because he lied to us, baby.

It's complicated, all right? Look, we can
get a deal some place else, trust me.

If you trust him,
you might end up like Tone.

Yeah. That was a thick-headed kid

who had no idea his best friend
was robbing his end.

What's he talking about?

What am I talking about?
Around the time that Tone got killed,

this dude had his label so strapped

that he had to steal checks
from Tone's moms just to dig hisself out.

That was a long time ago.

Okay. That was a long time ago.

Let's talk recent history.

Your boy over here didn't try to change
anything from your deal, August.

Just a, uh... what was it, a pay bump?
And a producer credit for hisself.

Fuck you, Terrence.

Nah, you done fucked yourself, dude.

Well, Chicago is scorched earth.

I mean, you and me are done, man.
I was your only friend.

We done.

He's just a child, Romelo.

August?

August.

August.

Hey, August. Come here, man.

[DISTORTED SOUNDSCAPE]

August!

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]


Just... Just open the door
so I can explain myself to you, okay?

August?
[MS. MONROE] He's not here!


He's not here...


Mrs. Monroe?

I will bring him home safe.

I promise you that.

I promise you that.


[THUNDER RUMBLING]

I figured you'd be here.

Your moms is worried, man.

Wasn't nothing good
about that deal, all right?

Believe me, there's better shit
out there for us...

Man, you ain't been 100 about nothing,
from the jump.

The whole time you were running game?
Behind my back?

You right.

I was dead wrong about you.

You see that building way out there,
the one with the blue lights on it?

Me and Tone, we grew up right there.

Man, I'm tired of you
throwing that nigga name in my face.

Hey.

Look here, man.

I came up in a Robert Taylor Home...

making tracks with Antonio
from two floors down, man.

Next thing I know, we got our own imprint

on the biggest label in the world.

You're too young to remember this, but...

we didn't make it out of that place.

My pops moved in in '71...

and died in that motherfucker.

I didn't know much back then,
but I knew one thing.

I was never going back.

I was trying to prove that shit
to everyone.

That's how I fucked up.
Get a loan to pay a loan.

You dip into another artist's pocket,

now I'm bailing water
like it's the <i>Titanic.</i>

You saying that you done fucked
every nigga that you done worked with?

Nah. I'm saying that after the lawsuits...

after the IRS done sucked my bone dry
of its fucking marrow,

man, I came right back here
to the South Side,

damn sure that this wasn't
how my life was supposed to be.

I'd do anything to get back.

Anything.

But today...

today, I learned that that wasn't true.

You see, man, that short money...

that shit don't last. I done that.

I got to get my mom back her life.

Ain't on you.

It is.
Mm-mm.

She fucked up 'cause of me.


Kari is dead 'cause of me.
Nah, man.

You're a kid, man. That ain't on you.

You know...

I'm not good.

You get that?

I'm not good.

Everywhere I go, I see it.

She reminded me of what I done.

Hey.

Your sister wouldn't want you
carrying around that, man.

On God, that's not what she'd want.

This is Chicago, August,
and it ain't on you to change that shit.


I miss her so much.

I know.

Come here.

I know, man.

I got it from here.

All right, big man.

Romelo.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Thank you.

I got you.

[POLICE SIREN BLARING]

Be careful.

I'll see you tonight, Ma.

Thanks, Ms. Robinson.

Come on,

Yes, ma'am.

I'm happy to see you.

It's a little boomy. Bring up the mids.

Levels are good.

I know.

Wow.

Didn't think I'd ever see you
around here again.

So? What up?
