Good.

So now what happens to you,

you're supposed to
go to court and you don't go.

Well, you know, I - I think

Jimmy, check this out.

Yeah,
and then they take his urn,
you know, his picture...

-Mug shot, they take.
-Right, the mug shot,

No, they're nice,
they're good pictures.
They're very good pictures.

-You girls are funny.
-It's not funny,
I don't think it's funny.

-It's not very funny, Jon.
-Listen, listen I ...

all right, but nothin's gonna
happen to me, all right?

CELIA:
Oh, you know, I don't know,
maybe if you're lucky,

you know, I' come visit you
once in a while...

bring you
something to eat, maybe,

That's lucky.

CELIA: so you don't
get raped too much.

Listen, nothin's
gonna happen, all right?

Yeah,
those are like fuckin' famous
last words, you know?

Like what they said when
that urn,
that spaceship blew up?

What spaceship?

You know,

All right, let me
tell you somethin', man.

They come
knockin' at your door
in the middle of the night?

Just don't answer


Good, everybody's a fuckin'
comedian in this house-

I swear to God, listen.

They're not gonna come
lookin' for me, man,

lookin' for you, maybe.
Yeah, I think so.

Lookin' for him, for what?

You know, he thinks
that for some reason,

you know, they're just
gonna forget about him.

Oh, yeah, that shit
happens all the time.

Jon Sousa, oh yeah,
that kid deserves a break.

Leave him alone,
forget about him.

We changed all
the rules for him.

A fuckin' pessimist over here.

I swear to God,
I thought you were
supposed to be on my side?

I'm not no pessimist,
I'm lookin at it from
a realistic,

Realistic. You heard that?

She's being realistic.

Listen, I'm just
tellin' you how it is,

You're bein' negative.

Now we do what we could do
to help him out.

And there you have it. Okay?

-Look. I'm your buddy, right?

correctional facilities...

So that you come back a
better person, you know?

Well look at me,

Instead of goin'

Boom! But I like it, you know,
it's a good fuckin' system.

It's all about opportunity,
brother.

I guess so, man, I guess so.

Frank the bank, come on.
Come on,

A little taste, Jimmy.

Just that boom.

He's a believer, Jimmy.

Hello, boom!

Very very good idea, actually.

-Jimmy, come over here,
I gotta talk to you.

-Love you.
-Yeah.

Can I ask you something?

What are all
these doin' over here?

What are all what doin' here?

What are all these

I don't know.

Maybe - I don't know,
how many are there?

How many are there,
is that what you just said?

Uh-huh.

Jimmy, I don't know
how many there are.

I - I guess they're
just here, I guess, I -

They're here, why?

They grow.

I guess they belong
to Frank, I don't know.

Oh, you guess
they belong to Frank
or they belong to Frank?

-They're his.
-They're his.

Yeah.

So he just leaves these guns
sittin' here while he goes off

wherever the'fuck
Frankie goes, right?

Oh, baby, look, I'll -
I'll put 'em somewhere.

-No,
you know what I was thinkin'?
-What?

I was thinkin'
that we should have
Mr. McGonegal come over

and take a look at
these things, right?

You know,
he'll tell us more about -em
or something, right?

It's not like it's, you know,
violating your probation

having these sittin' here
in the fuckin' house, right?

I don't know babe.

Why don't we call
him on the phone
and we'll find out, you know.

We could have him
over for dinner -

There you go. Right.

Call him up, you know,
I'll give you his number,
whatever.

Oh, Jimmy.

All right, look.

I'll put 'em away, all right?

No, it's nice, more guns,
that's good, that's very good.

Hey baby, these guns
are worth a lot of money.

They're worth
a lot of money to who?

I don't know, to uh,

whoever, I don't know.

-What, are you
selling these to people?
-No.

Jimmy.

That's not what
he's doing, right?

-Shut the fuck up, Johnny.
-Hey.

He's not selling
these things, right?

No, of course
that's - of course not.

He better not be,
man, there are
fuckin' kids walking

All right? okay, I'm gonna
put 'em away, all right?

Put 'em somewhere, all right?

Denise, guns don't
kill people, all right?
People kill people.

-You, Jon,
are not very funny, okay?
Yes I am.

-Have you been home yet?
-No.

Well, don't you
think maybe you should
go home and talk to her?

Why, you think so?

Oh, yeah,
it's a lot of fun here, man.
A laugh riot.

Jimmy, why don't you go
throw them under the bed,
all right?

'cause nobody's
ever gonna think
to look underneath the bed.

Oh, baby, those were
my thoughts exactly.

You had thoughts,
this is good,
this is very good.

You fuckin' guys,
pair of fuckin' geniuses,

I swear to God I love this.

I really do.
Go ahead, keep laughin'.

-Well?
-Yeah, what.

-Aren't you gonna
go home, you think?
Nan,

No, see Jon, you're not.

You're gonna go
the fuck home now.

What do you mean?

Get the fuck out of here,
that's what I mean,
get out of here.

Johnny, come on, take the
fuckin' beer with you,
get out of here.

Come on, Johnny.

Let's go please,

CELIA: I'm okay.

JON: You mad at me?

-Yeah.
-JON: How come?

Fuck you, Johnny.

JON: I got a little
pissed off, I'm sorry.

Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
shit to me, all right,

'cause you're the one
with the fucked up problem.

JON: I said I was sorry.

Yeah, that doesn't mean
anything to me, you know.

Because you always think
you can fuckin' hit a person

and that it's all right,
like nothin fuckin happens.

JON: Yeah,
so what do you want me to do?

I know what I'm doin'.

JON: What are you doin'?

-I'm moving out.
-JON: [LAUGHING]

JON: Aw. Movin' out?

I'm waitin' for Lucy
and I'm moving out.

JON: To where?

CELIA: You think I'm
fuckin' telling you?

Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell me,

what do you mean,
you're not gonna tell me.
what -

-CELIA: It's fuckin' over.
-What?

CELIA: You fuckin' heard me.

So what,
you're just gonna say this,
I'm supposed to

I don't really care
what you do, you know,
I'm just

JON: Aw. So what,
you're just going ahead
and make this decision?

Yeah, that's exactly
what I did, Johnny,
I made this decision.

You don't even want to
talk about it or nothin'?

No. Not really, no.

JON: All right, go ahead.
Fuck you.

-JON: Go ahead, what the fuck?
-I'm fuckin' goin'.

Good.

Here, you want your stuff?

JON:
What the fuck are you doin?
What were you, waitin' for me?

Yeah,
I was fuckin waiting for you.

And I'm fuckin going.

Good.
I'll tell you what, Ceil.

You didn't have
to wait for me.

You could have just
left a note, you know?


What did you think
she'd do man, you stupid? Huh?

I guess I am.

I think you are, man.

I mean what would
you do if somebody

smacked you
around all the time?

Oh man,
I've been smacked around
my whole fuckin' life.

So now what, man,
you takin' it
the fuck out on her?

What do you know about it?

Hey, I know it was enough
to make her bail out, man.

Hey Johnny...

Why don't you just
go and say you know,

I'm sorry or some shit,
you know, because ...

I'm gonna be hearing about
this shit from
now until Hoses.

I don't even know
where she's going, all right?

Yeah, well this is
a major disruption
of normal life,


Hey, I'm serious.

I mean you love her?

If you love her,
man, why are you
smackin' her

JIMMY: You know what you do,
you write her a letter.
