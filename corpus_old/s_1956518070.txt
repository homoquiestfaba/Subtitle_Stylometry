[in English] Do you have
a second to save marine life?

[speaks in Mandarin]

All right.
[in English] I was gonna say

something snarky,
but I used to work this job.

Ooh, what happened, girl?
You got fired?

I quit! Because I was
about to get fired.

[both laugh]
[Nai Nai speaking Mandarin]

[announcement continues]
Hey.


Okay.

[machine whirring]

[radiologist speaking]

[indistinct conversation]

[Haiyan in English] So one
day, the wife goes out of town.

And when she returns,
the husband says,

"Honey, the cat is dead."

And she says,

"How can you tell me
so abruptly like this?"

You have to ease me
into bad news.

Like, um, "Honey, the cat..."

"he got on the roof.

"And, uh, so..."" [chuckles]

Now...

a few months later,

the wife
goes out of town again.

And she returns

and the husband
greets her again.

But this time,
he learned his lesson.

And as the wife comes
through the door, he says,

"Honey, your mom,
she got on the roof."

[all laughing]

[continues conversing

[door opens]

[objects clatter]

[wings flapping]

How did you get in here?

[cell phone vibrating]

Nai Nai.
[Nai Nai] Billi!

[Nai Nai speaking Mandarin]

[Nai Nai chuckles]

[Mr. Li] Huh?

[Mr. Li] Oh.

[Billi speaking]

[Nai Nai speaking]


[Billi speaking]


[Nai Nai] Eh?

[Nai Nai speaking]

[in English] Okay.

I love you, Nai Nai.

I love you. I love you.

[siren blaring in distance]

[car alarm blaring
in distance]

For what month?

For this month? May?

And what happened to April?

My mom says
you didn"t pay April yet.


You know,
if you moved out right now,

we could literally
double the rent?

you"re broke again?

Are you always
going to live like this?

Poor but sexy, I hope so.

Why you not try to save, huh?

You should change
your expensive lifestyle.

Mom, if you"re gonna
give me shit

every time I come home,

I"m not coming home anymore.

Lower your voice.
Dad"s sleeping.

Sleeping? It"s 6:00 p.m.
What"s wrong with him?

He"s just tired.

Is he okay?

He"s fine,
we"re just busy that"s all.

What"s going on?

Hao Hao"s getting married,
so we have to go to China.

What? Since when?

Hasn"t he like just started
dating that girl?

You don"t need to go.

No one"s expecting you to go.

I mean,
he"s my only cousin.

Don"t you think
I should be there?

Okay, okay.

Do you think
he knocked her up?


How many wontons you want?

Five.
Five? That"s not enough.


Ten"s good.

Okay.
[cutlery clanking]

What"s wrong, Dad?


You and mom
got in a fight?

You"ve been drinking?

Please tell me
what"s going on.

You"re scaring me.

Something"s going on.

Just tell me what"s going on.

Your Nai Nai"s dying.

She has
a stage four lung cancer.

The doctor says
she has three months.

Could be faster,
you never know.

[Billi] I need to call her.
You can"t do that.

I need to go see her.
Can"t do that.

She doesn"t know.

The family thinks
it"s better not to tell her.

So you can"t say anything.

I don"t understand.

She doesn"t have a lot of time
left, she should know, right?

There"s nothing they can do.

So everyone decided
it"s better not to tell her.

Why is that better?

Chinese people
have saying:

"When people get cancer,
they die."

It"s not the cancer that
kills them, it"s the fear.

Okay, when were you guys
gonna tell me this?

How could you
let me find out like this?

How should I have told you?
"Oh, your grandma"s on the roof"?


W-What about the wedding?

The wedding is an excuse,
so everyone can go see her.

We leave
first thing in the morning.

I need to go.

[Haiyan] Billi...
I need to go. [sniffles]

it "s better if you don" t.

Look at you.
You can"t hide your emotions.

If you go, Nai Nai will
find out right away.

You"re the losing stock.

[Jian speaking Mandarin]

[Nai Nai speaking]


[in English] Mom, that church
is not representative

of all America.

We have a lot of problems.
Guns, health care.

Visit from America?

I went to school

Where do you live?

Uh, I"m in New York.

New York.

I always wanted
to visit New York.

It"s a very beautiful city.

Yeah, it"s very beautiful.
Uh, question:

Do you know about
my grandma"s condition?

[speaking Mandarin]

[speaking Mandarin]

[Nai Nai] Uh...


[in English] How bad is she?

You can tell me the truth.

[Doctor Song in English]
The cancer is quite advanced.


[Doctor Song] In her situation,

most families in China
would choose not to tell her.

When my grandmother
had cancer,

my family didn"t tell her.

Isn"t it wrong to lie?

[Doctor Song] I mean, if it"s for
good, it"s not really a lie.

it"s still a lie.

It"s a good lie.

How"s your grandmother?

She passed away, a few months
after she was diagnosed.

[speaking Mandarin]

[Nai Nai speaking]

[Billi] Mom!
[Haiyan speaks Mandarin]

[Billi in English]
Can we not right now?

[Haiyan speaks Mandarin]

[scanner chimes]
[Jian speaking]

[Billi in English]
Just leave him alone.

[Jian speaking in Mandarin]

[Haiyan grunting]

[scanner chimes]

[in English] Nai Nai should
not be organizing this wedding.

Well, if she enjoys it,
then just let her do it.

She"s sick.

She should be resting
or in a hospital.

Not stressing
about a fake wedding.

You really don"t know
your Nai Nai.

You know she enjoys
bossing everyone around.

Makes her feel important.

Makes her feel in control.

Mom.
It"s true!

That"s why she hated to stay
in America in our house.

You know? Because she could
not tell anyone what to do.

Whatever I do,
never good enough for her.

But she can"t say anything,
because it was my house.

Mom, stop!

What?

[speaks Mandarin]

You have always had issues
with her, but right now...

I don"t have a problem with her.
She"s the one that have a problem with me!

She "s dying. Can" t you be
a little more sensitive?

What you want from me?
To scream and cry like you?

You know, when my father died,
I also very sad.

But I don"t act like you.

When I went back to China
for the funeral,

everybody was watching me.

They all were expecting me
to fall apart.

And they think if I don"t
cry, I don"t love my father.

No one"s asking you to cry!

[Haiyan speaks Mandarin]

[in English]
I don"t like, you know,

put all my emotion on display.

Like I"m in the zoo.

But in here, if you don"t cry,
you don"t put a show,

they think that
you don"t love your family.

You know, in here,
they even hire some professional criers.

Just to show how sad they are.

It"s just so ridiculous.

I hate that.

[wailing loudly]

[continues wailing]

Hey, this looks so familiar.

[Haiyan speaks Mandarin]

[Haiyan in English]
Do you remember that house?

You used to love to play
in the garden.


[Jian speaks Mandarin]

[Nai Nai speaking]


[Billi in English] Dad?
Hmm?

[door opens]

Are you smoking?
[Haiyan] Hmm?

Uh, I thought
you said you quit.

I did.

I will.

[speaking Mandarin]

[in English]
Go back to bed, Billi.

[speaking Mandarin]

[Haiyan sighs]

[Billi in English] What"re
you guys talking about?

Nothing.

[speaking Mandarin]

[Uncle Haibin sighs] Billi.

[sighs deeply]

[Hao Hao speaks]


[in English] Mom?
Yeah?

I want to stay in China

and help take care of Nai Nai.


You stay here, to do what?

You can"t cook,
you can"t clean.

[speaks Mandarin]

[in English]
I"ll figure it out, Mom.

And what?

Wait for her to die?

What about the fellowship?

Just forget about it, huh?

You"re 30 years old,

but you can stop your life
and stay here?

And every day
she has to look at you,

with that sad-looking face?

That"s not nice
for anybody, right?

You know, one of the few good
memories of my childhood

were those summers
at Nai Nai"s.

They had that garden.

Ye Ye and I would
catch dragonflies.


And then we just moved
to the States.

Everything was different.
Everyone was gone.

And it was just
the three of us.


I know it was hard.

It was hard for us too.

that it was a good thing,

but all I saw
was fear in your eyes.

And I was confused
and scared constantly

because you never told me
what was going on.

And then Ye Ye died.

You didn"t even tell me
he was sick.

So it felt like he just

vanished suddenly.

And you wouldn"t even let me
go to his funeral.

You were at school.

We didn"t want you
to miss school.

We did what we thought
was best for you.

But I never saw him again.

And every time
I came back to China,

he just...
he just wasn"t there anymore.

and he"s just gone.

The house is gone,
A Die"s gone,

our Beijing home is gone,
and soon she"ll be gone, too.
