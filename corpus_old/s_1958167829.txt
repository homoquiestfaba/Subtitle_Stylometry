CEDAR WOOD:
I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

THAT LADY SCARES

(SCARED BLEATS)

HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR!

IT'S NOT MY MOM'S FAULT

RAVEN QUEEN: OOPS.

LIZZIE HEARTS:

FAYBELLE THORN:
HELLO? RAVEN JUST, LIKE,
TOTALLY INSULTED YOUR MOM?

RAVEN QUEEN:
SORRY, LIZZIE.

I WAS JUST TRYING
TO POINT OUT

IF YOU'RE GONNA LOOK
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME,

BLAME HEADMASTER GRIMM!

HE'S ALWAYS LIKE,

"YOU MUST FOLLOW
YOUR OWN STORIES"

AND "LET'S TRAP THE EVIL QUEEN
IN A MIRROR, FOREVER".

<i>HA, AM I RIGHT?</i>

HE'S STANDING RIGHT BEHIND ME,
ISN'T HE?

HEADMASTER GRIMM:
CORRECT. AND YOU MAY BE SEATED.

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,
UNDERSTAND THIS.

THE WONDERLAND CURSE
IS DANGEROUS,

NO ONE MUST BE ALLOWED
TO HAVE CONTACT

WITH THAT WORLD
FOR ANY REASON,

IT HAS BEEN SEALED OFF
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

APPLE WHITE:
OH OH OH, HEADMASTER GRIMM!

ACTUALLY, AS PART OF MY ARTICLE
FOR THE GRYPHON,

I WAS HOPING TO ASK YOU ABOUT
THE CURSE AND WHAT EXACTLY IT-

HEADMASTER GRIMM:
ENOUGH! THE WORLDS MUST
REMAIN SEPARATE

AND THAT IS ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

(BELL RINGS)
NOW OFF TO YOUR CLASSES!

APPLE WHITE:
HEY, HEY EVERYBODY...

I'M LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS
TO HELP WITH THE STORY!

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

MEET ME IN THE STUDY HALL
AFTER CLASS.

(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

HEY, APPLE, I'M REALLY SORRY
I MESSED UP YOUR SPEECH.

OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

I JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE WONDERLAND CURSE.

I MEAN, WHY DOES HEADMASTER
GRIMM-

<i>PROFESSOR RUMPELSTILTSKIN:</i>

(SCARED GASPS)

<i>(EVIL CHUCKLE)</i>
<i>NOW PREPARE TO MIX!</i>

UH, I DIDN'T READ CHAPTER 3.

OH, DON'T WORRY.

IT'S JUST AN EXTENSION
OF EVERYTHING WE COVERED
IN CHAPTER 2.

BUT THAT WAS LAST WEEK, RIGHT?

FIVE PARTS 3-O-2 S-O-4.

<i>EIGHT PART PIXIE DUST...</i>

<i>ADD ISOTOPE OF 5-U-7!</i>
<i>NO, 4-U-7!</i>

<i>AHAHAHAH!</i>

RAVEN QUEEN:
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MAKE IT
LOOK SO EASY, APPLE.

I CAN HARDLY KEEP UP
WITH HIM.

IF YOU KNOW THE FORMULAS
AND THE MOHEXULAR VALENCES

CROSS REFERENCED WITH
THE PERIODIC TABLE,

WELL, THEN IT'S JUST LOGIC.

ALL:
(IN AWE) OH...

GOOD JOB, APPLE WHITE.
I GIVE YOU A, AH, B+.

I, APPLE WHITE, HEREBY CALL
THIS PLANNING MEETING TO ORDER.

ALL HERE PLEASE STATE
YOUR NAME... FOR THE RECORD.

UM, DARLING CHARMING?

OKAY, ONLY ONE PERSON,
BUT WE'LL MAKE IT WORK!

THANKS FOR COMING,
DARLING.

IS THERE SOME SPECIAL INTEREST
YOU HAVE IN WONDERLAND?

OH, UH, YOU KNOW...

WHO ISN'T INTERESTED
IN WONDERLAND?

ESPECIALLY WHAT SECRETS
IT MIGHT HOLD.

(QUICKLY COVERS)
NOT THAT I LIKE SECRETS!

OR I HAVE ANY!
OR... UM...

WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE YOUR HELP.

NOW SINCE IT'S
JUST THE TWO OF US, I-

(DOOR OPENS, GASPS)

OH LIZZIE!
GLAD YOU CAN MAKE IT!

APPLE, I'M SORRY, BUT EVEN
TALKING ABOUT WONDERLAND

IS DIFFICULT FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

OH, WELL, THAT'S OKAY, LIZZIE,
WE DON'T HAVE TO-

LIZZIE HEARTS:
SEE, TODAY IS MY MOTHER'S
BIRTHDAY.

DARLING CHARMING:
OH, BUT THAT'S WONDERFUL.

LIZZIE HEARTS:
HMM... NOT REALLY.

SHE SENT ME AN INVITATION...

YOUR PRESENTS ARE REQUESTED
AT THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY BASH.

<i>YES, IT HAS BEEN FAR TOO LONG,</i>

AND I CANNOT WAIT TO BASK
IN YOUR PRESENTS!

P.S.: DON'T FORGET
THE PRESENTS.

YOUR MOM SURE
LIKES PRESENTS.

I SO WOULD LOVE TO BE THERE
TO HELP HER SPELL-EBRATE.

BUT WITH THE ENTRANCE SEALED,
I CAN NEVER GO HOME.

APPLE WHITE:
I'M SORRY.
THAT MUST BE SO DIFFICULT.

FAYBELLE THORN:

AN INVISIBILITY SPELL.
BOOYAH!

SORRY, BUT I HAD TO PULL
THE BRAKES ON THAT SOB STORY.

WE WERE ONLY ONE PART AWAY
FROM WATERWORKS

AND I DON'T THINK THE
FOUNDATION IS FLOOD PROOF.

SO, LITTLE MISS
"I HEART WONDERLAND"

WANTS TO GO HOME
AND SEE HER MOMMY,

SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED THE HELP
OF A DARK FAIRY.

YUP, YOU NEED SOME PRETTY
POWERFUL MAGIC TO GET TO
WONDERLAND

AND CLEARLY I'M THE MOST
POWERFUL ONE HERE -

(MAGIC WHOOSHING,
COUGHING)

FINALLY!
I GOT US TO THE STUDY HALL.

APPLE WHITE:
YOU GUYS CAME!

SORRY I'M LATE, APPLE.

OH, AND SORRY I SMASHED YOU,
FAYBELLE.

I'M STILL GETTING THE HANG OF
THIS 'MAGIC SPELL' BUSINESS.

BUNNY WHITE:
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

FAYBELLE THORN:
GET. OFF. ME.

BUNNY WHITE:
OH, SORRY.

ALISTAIR:
HAS THE MEETING STARTED YET?

<i>MADELINE HATTER:</i>
<i>OF COURSE IT HASN'T.</i>

YOU CAN'T START A MEETING
UNTIL YOU'VE HAD TEA.

OH, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE TEA
WITHOUT SCONES.

AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T EAT
A SCONE WITHOUT JAM.

OH! AND I WOULD NEVER EAT JAM
WITHOUT BUTTER.

AND YOU CAN'T SPREAD
YOUR BUTTER WITHOUT A-

<i>BROOKE PAGE:</i>
<i>OHH, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!</i>
<i>FREEZE!</i>

MADELINE HATTER:
OH. HI! IS THAT THE NEW-ISH
NARRATOR?

HOWZIT GOIN'?

<i>FEMALE NARRATOR:</i>
<i>BROOKE, NOT ONE MORE WORD.</i>

<i>BROOKE PAGE:</i>
<i>I'M SORRY,</i>
<i>BUT I CAN'T BE QUIET.</i>

<i>MADDIE, LIZZIE NEEDS TO KNOW.</i>
<i>HER MOTHER IS IN DANGER!</i>

<i>SOMEONE IS GONNA TRY</i>
<i>AND OVERTHROW HER MOTHER</i>

<i>AND STEAL HER THRONE, TODAY!</i>

<i>IF YOU DON'T STOP</i>
<i>THIS HORRIBLE PLOT...</i>

IT COULD BE... (GASP)
OFF WITH HER HEAD!

LIZZIE HEARTS:
IF MY MOTHER IS IN DANGER,
WELL, WE-

ALISTAIR:
DON'T WORRY, LIZZIE, WE'LL
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HELP HER.

BUNNY:
BUT HOW, IF WE CAN'T EVEN
GET BACK TO WONDERLAND?

RAVEN QUEEN:
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY.

A WEAK SPOT, OR-OR A SECRET
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

DARLING CHARMING:
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT
WHAT'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
WONDERLAND BEFORE?

I MEAN WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY OLD RESEARCH, AREN'T WE?

RAVEN QUEEN:
EVERYBODY, GRAB A BOOK.

LOOK FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN
FIND OUT ABOUT WONDERLAND,

OR HOW TO GET BACK - ANYTHING!

UGH, TYPICAL.

ALISTAIR: HMM...
BUNNY: UGH... OH!

WHOA! WHOA!

(UNSTEADY MOANS)

WELL, HERE'S
AN INTERESTING FACT.

MADDY IS IT TRUE
THAT SCHOOL IN WONDERLAND

IS HELD ONLY
ONE DAY A YEAR?

MADELINE HATTER:
YEAH, BUT WE HAVE TO CRAM
A L-L-L-L-L-LOTTA STUDY

INTO THAT ONE DAY!

ALISTAIR:
IT WAS A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE.

BUNNY:
AND YOUR MOM REALLY
IS A GOOD QUEEN, LIZZIE.

I THINK THE CURSE HAS JUST
KINDA STRESSED HER OUT.

LIZZIE HEARTS:
THANKS, BUNNY.

IT MUST BE SO HARD FOR HER,

ALL ALONE WITH A WHOLE QUEENDOM
TO TAKE CARE OF.

<i>RAVEN QUEEN:</i>
<i>I'M SORRY, LIZZIE.</i>

DESPITE WHAT I SAID
IN THE CASTLETERIA,

THIS REALLY IS
MY MOM'S FAULT.

I ALMOST WISH SHE WERE AROUND.

I COULD REASON WITH HER.

SHE'D BE POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO OPEN UP THE WORLDS AGAIN.

<i>BROOKE PAGE:</i>
<i>WHOA! WHOA-WHOA! HASHTAG:</i>
<i>"I DIDN'T DO MY HOMEWORK".</i>

<i>SO, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED</i>
<i>TO THE EVIL QUEEN?</i>

<i>MALE NARRATOR:</i>
<i>BROOKE! OKAY...</i>
<i>THE EVIL QUEEN,</i>

<i>WANTED TO BRING ALL THE REALMS</i>
<i>UNDER HER EVIL RULE,</i>

<i>SO SHE CAST A DARK SPELL</i>

<i>UPON HEARING OF THE EVIL</i>
<i>QUEEN'S PLAN,</i>

<i>GILES, MILTON GRIMM</i>
<i>AND BABA YAGA TOOK ACTION.</i>

<i>MILTON GRIMM:</i>

WHILE UPON YOUR DEEDS
YOU SHALL REFLECT.

YOU'VE FAILED THIS WORLD
TO OVERWHELM

AND ARE CAST INTO
THE MIRROR REALM!

(MAGIC FIZZLES)

EVIL QUEEN:
NOOOOOOOO!

LET ME OUT!
LET ME OUT!

<i>MALE NARRATOR:</i>
<i>SHE WAS IMPRISONED</i>
<i>IN THE MIRROR REALM.</i>

<i>DOOMED TO WALK THE MYSTERIOUS</i>
<i>SPACE BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD</i>

<i>AND OUR REFLECTIONS</i>
<i>FOREVERMORE.</i>

<i>BROOKE PAGE:</i>
<i>SO, SHE'S TRAPPED</i>
<i>BEHIND A MIRROR?</i>

<i>FEMALE NARRATOR:</i>
<i>ALL MIRRORS.</i>

<i>EVIL QUEEN:</i>
<i>(EVIL LAUGHTER)</i>

AH, MY DARLING DAUGHTER
AND ALL HER LITTLE FRIENDS.

PERHAPS THERE'S A WAY
TO USE THIS CRISIS

TO LEAD HER DOWN MY PATH.

YOU WANT TO GO TO WONDERLAND,
MY DEAR?


HERE'S A HELPFUL NUDGE
FROM YOUR MOMMY.

<i>(CACKLES)</i>

OH...

MY MOTHER...

MADELINE HATTER:
BUT THIS BOOK
IS ABOUT WONDERLAND.

WHY WOULD IT HAVE A PICTURE
OF THE EVIL QUEEN?

APPLE WHITE:
GOOD QUESTION.
HERE, SET IT DOWN.

I'LL TRY NEW HEXAMINATION APP.

SCAN PHOTO.

SHE'S GOT A BOOK IN HER HAND.

I WONDER IF WE CAN SEE
WHAT'S IN IT.

<i>MOVE UP AND TO THE RIGHT...</i>

RAVEN QUEEN:
LOOK, IN THE MIRROR.

<i>APPLE WHITE:</i>
<i>ZOOM IN ON MIRROR.</i>

BUNNY:
THERE'S WRITING THERE.

ALISTAIR:
CAN ANYONE READ IT?

<i>APPLE WHITE:</i>
<i>REVERSE IMAGE. ENHANCE!</i>

RAVEN QUEEN:

MADELINE HATTER:
OHH! IF WE KNOW THE CURSE,
YOU CAN REVERSE IT.

APPLE WHITE:
THE CURSE WILL BE BROKEN,

AND PROFESSOR GRIMM
WILL REMOVE THE SEAL

BETWEEN OUR WORLD
AND WONDERLAND.

RAVEN QUEEN:

DARLING CHARMING:
RAVEN! THE EVIL QUEEN'S CURSE

MUST HAVE ITS OWN
PROTECTIVE MAGIC.

<i>ONLY ONE OF THE QUEEN'S FAMILY</i>
<i>HAS THE POWER TO REVERSE IT.</i>

APPLE WHITE:
BUT RAVEN, YOU'RE DESTINED
TO BE THE EVIL QUEEN.

IT'LL WORK FOR YOU.

RAVEN QUEEN:
APPLE...

BRIAR BEAUTY:
WELL, YOU'RE SURE CREATIVE
ENOUGH TO FIGURE IT OUT.

RAVEN QUEEN:
