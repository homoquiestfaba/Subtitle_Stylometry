â™ª Pack all your dreams, â™ª

â™ª Throw in
a little ambition. â™ª

â™ª Don't forget the
vision,â™ª

â™ª Now off we go. â™ª

â™ª Just give it a whirl, â™ª

â™ª No matter where
in the world it finds us,â™ª

â™ª We've got our
love to bind us... â™ª

[ Man: ]
We've got it!

[ Laughing ]
We've finally got it...

[ Woman: ]
After all these years--

one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars!

[ Laughing together ]

Is that all
the money in the world?

Well,
it's not quite

all the money
in the world, sweetie,

but it's enough to get
us around the world.

Oh, boy!

We're going
to Disney World?

Maurice, you are going
to Disney World, Disneyland,

Disney Down Under, EuroDisney,
and any other Disney

they come up with
in the next two months.

Fiji, Fuji, London,
Lyon, Tibet, you bet.

[ Laughing ]

You are all going to have
the education of a life time!

You're going to have
so many stories to tell

when you
get back to school.

[ Laughing together ]

â™ª Searching the world. â™ª

â™ª To find the right equation, â™ª

â™ª It takes some rearranging

[ Rattling ]

[ Sleepily ]
Who's there?

Sherm?

What happened?!

Sherm?

Sherm?!

[ Slowly ]
All the money in the world.

[ Sirens ]

[ Intercom ]
Paging Dr. McDunna--
call the nurses' station.

Paging Dr. McDunna.

Mrs. Andrews, he's stable,
but he's had a serious stroke.

I'm sorry.

[ Indistinct chatter ]

Hey, watch this.

wanna be in our club,
and get a jacket?

Why don't you...

[ Crash ]

...watch where
you're going.

Seventh grader.

They'll fall
for anything.

[ Laughing continues ]

Hey, Will.

Hey, Jim.

Hey,
look at this.

There was a lady here with
her daughter having a picnic.

They went up there.

Well, maybe I can
still catch 'em.

Tell you what--just give 'em
a whiff of that wallet

and they'll
take you right there.

Okay.

There you go.

A little smell
there, huh?

Mush.

[ Barking ]

Whoa!!

[ Crash ]

Oh, ahh...

Are you okay?

I'm fine...I'm fine,

but it looks like
I lost my marbles though.

[ Girl: ]
Can I help?

Sure.

So why are you
pickin' 'em up?

They're not worth
anything now.

Oh, I'll find
some use for 'em.

Everything has value.

Everything...and every one.

Aghhhhhh!!!

What is she doing?

Stranger Danger.

Super Duper.

Oh, I almost forgot.

I believe
this is yours.

Oh, my goodness.

My grocery money!

Thank you.

No need to thank me.

Haaaaa!

On Donner, on Dancer,
on...Brucey.

[ Barking ]

[ Girl: ]
Well, I think you've
got the coolest job.

This place is so bad.

Yeah, I'm just--I'm making
the big bucks now.

You know, I--I'm trying
to be humble about it.

[ Girl: ]
...that kid, Chuck,
last week?

When I saw him, I just
couldn't believe it.

Yeah,
I'll see ya.

Go ahead...take it.

That's it.

Right there...

Yes!

Yes!

Annie,
what a nice surprise.

Hi, George.

I'm...supposed
to meet mother here.

She's late...

She's rarely late.

Well, it's lucky

I just happened
to be here then, isn't it?

May I--may I buy you something
cool to drink while you wait?

Hmmm?

C'mon.

Mother,
you're toast!!

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm making
some real bucks now,

but I'm trying
to be humble about it.

Yeah, that's a pretty
humble-looking new car

you just bought.

What is that?
A Dodge Wiper?

Dodge Wiper?

No, it's a
Ferrari...F40.

[ Chuckling ]

Will there be
anything else?

No, thank you.

There you are.

Will you be
needing change?

Yeah.

Hey, buddy,
how 'bout a quarter?

Very tempting, but I think
you ought to hang on to it.

Annie, will you have dinner
with me Friday night?

George, you know...

No...
no, thank you, George.

Okay.

Okay.

Look, I'm not
trying to push you.

I just want know...

Answer me
one question--

what does Will have
that I don't?

I gotta go.

I have a nice car!

That's it!

I quit!

Will, wait!

It wasn't
what it looked like.

Don't you want
to know what it was?

I know, it's not
what it looked like.

That's the truth,
right?

Yes, but what
I'm dying to know is,

have you
talked to dad yet?

I'm working on it--
don't rush me.

Rush you?

It's been
three years, Will.

[ Man: ]
This is what you
interrupted me for?

A hundred dollars
for a club jacket?

I don't think so.

Oh, please, Dad.

You gotta give me the money
for that jacket.

I'm a seventh grader
and they treat us all like dirt.

We're Farnsworthys and we have
our dignity to maintain here.

Without that jacket,
we're nothing.

Nobodies.

Well, how about mowing
a few lawns?

C'mon, Dad.

You know, son,
money isn't everything,

but earning it shows...

...Dedication.

And it's how
you establish your...

...Worth.

And when worthy people
want something important,

they go out and...

...Earn it.

Exactly!

You know, son,
when I was in the sixth grade,

I cleaned out latrines
after school.

Our parents didn't give us money
for everything we wanted.

We had to earn it.

There you go.

I'll help you with that.

Thanks.

C'mon,
it's not that bad.

C'mon, you Buttercreamers,
we're almost done.

I'm not
a Buttercreamer.

I'm getting paid.

Five measly bucks.

[ Sarcastically ]
And you're earning it.

Dusty, what we do in moments
of little importance

determines what we do in
moments of great importance.

Oh...

Wait, I think
this is yours.

Oh, thanks.

[ Boy: ]
You really oughta join.

Last Saturday,
we put up a fence.

We did it to help.

Just for fun.

I work for money--
period.

It's how you
establish your...

your...

Greed?

I'll get it, Mom.

No.

It's hard enough having
to move to the projects.

I don't want to be
reminded of another dream

that didn't come true.

If only your dad could
tell us where he put our money.

Don't you worry.

We're all gonna
be just fine.

Hey, Will.

Time to go.

Come on, Sherm, we're going
to your new apartment.

[ Clears throat ]

Right there.

Oh, I'm sorry!

I am so sorry.

Okay.

Alright.

Alright...

I'm so very sorry.

Whoa!

I apologize.

I apologize...

Okay, okay.

Ahhh!

Okay, okay...
sorry, sorry.

Here we go.

I'm sorry.

Ahhhhhh!

I am so sorry.

Will he feel
any of this?

Okay,
here we go, Sherm.

Do you see that, Will?

Ah, yes,
Mr. Farnsworthy.

Do you know how many
of those it takes

to support a wife
and a family?

Well, I guess
it would depend

on how much the wife
and family weigh, sir!

Little science joke.

How many pennies
do you have saved, Will?

Uh...

Pretty much none...
zip.

Just what
I thought, Will.

Ooooh...

Sorry, sir.

Do you see that, Will?

Yeah.

It's still a penny, sir.

Oh, it's no
ordinary penny.

It's my lucky penny.

It's the first penny
I ever earned,

cleaning latrines
as a sixth grader.

My most precious possession.

Oh, Annie is very
precious to me, sir.

Exactly, Will.

It costs a fortune to raise
my precious little Annie,

and I'm not going
to let her marry just anyone.

You've gotta be worthy
to marry a Farnsworthy!

[ Laughing ]

Worthy...That's cute.

Just what makes
you think you're worthy

to marry my little Annie?

Because
I...love...her.

Yeah...

You're a science teacher.

You like experiments,
don't you, Will?

Um-hmm.

Let's do a little experiment,
just you and me.

If you save
ten thousand dollars,

I will allow you to marry
my precious little Annie.

Ah-haa!

Gosh, that's a
million pennies, sir.

Then I want you to make me
a promise right here and now

that you will not attempt to
marry my precious little Annie

until you have a million
pennies in the bank.

I promise, sir.

And thank you.

Thank you,
Mr. Farnsworthy,

for helping me see
what it takes to be worthy

of marrying a Farnsworthy.

Thank you.

Pick out your tux.

[ Quietly ]
Uh, yeah...

He fell for it.

Ah-ha!

This kid--I gotta
get him out of my life.

Are you alright?

Yes.

Did it work?

Perfectly.

By the time
he has the money...

... Annie will have married
George and raised a family.

A big family!

Will, did you
stay focused?

Yeah,
I think so.

It's all such a blur.

Well,
what did he say?

We can get married...

...as soon as I save
ten thousand dollars--

a million pennies.

A million pennies?

Yeah.

You let him talk you into
another ridiculous promise?

First, you promised
to graduate from college.

Then you had to get a job

and then you had
to keep it for three years.

And now you have to save
ten thousand dollars.

Why don't we just elope?

Yeah, hmm?

No...no, I can't.

I made a promise,
and I intend to keep it.

That's exactly
why I love you.

Psst, Dusty,
look over there.

Eww..

And...
no kissing...

Yes, sir.

...until the money
is in the bank.

Agghh!

Get this place
cleaned up.

Yeah, boss.

Well, what do
we have here?

The perfect route
for a honeymoon...

...with Annie.

Ha, ha, ha...
Finders keepers.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Losers weepers!

Being here
with the ones I love

is more precious than
all the money in the world.

And you better
figure out how to make

all the money in the world,
Mr. Science Teacher, or...

...Or what?

Well, George
did ask me out.

You wouldn't...
would you?

[ Annie: ]
So what are you gonna do,
Mr. Penny Promise?

Okay--recycle aluminum,
good money in that.

mow lawns, walk dogs...
uh, oh, paper route.

Huh?

Monthly collecting--
ding dong, collecting.

Love that paper route!

Okay, so I'm
making money--good.

And then we're saving money
with the phone cancel

and the cable cancel
and the paper cancel.

I got the skates.

No driving.

Come on--something else...
what else.

Hey, Will,
I made a list of...

Hey,
I don't believe it.

I made the same
list as you.

You did not!

[ Laughing ]

Yes!

[ Laughing together ]

Why is that funny?

Come on, Dusty,
we gotta go.

Okay.

Bye.

That's not funny.

Same list as you...

[ Dusty, laughing ]
I know!

These are legitimate
money making...

These are proven...

You've seen
the infomercials.

These work!

This is...

[ Laughing ]

Okay, but seriously now,
welcome everybody

to the magical world
of household chemistry!

Everybody in your groups.

Oh, I've whipped up
a couple of little models

I think you'll enjoy.

The blue gum balls
are the nucleus,

the red the protons,
the yellow, of course, are?

The electrons.

Obviously.

Thank you, Rudy.

Now,
let's find out

what really goes on
in our homes, shall we?

Mr. Duncan?

Yes?

Umm, what would happen

if I dumped this drain opener
into this water?

Pour some in, Maurice,
and we'll find out.

But remember,
be very careful--

any chemical
not handled right

can be very dangerous.

Ooo, aaah...

See, this stuff is composed
of sodium hydroxide

and flakes of aluminum.

When you mix that
with water,

the sodium hydroxide
reacts with the aluminum,

and so it releases heat--
it releases hydrogen--

Which in your drain
is no problem.

But under pressure...

Kablooey!

[ Bubbling ]

Hey, who corked
my beaker?

It's stuck.

It won't come out!

Emergency drill
number 5!

Emergency drill
number 5!

Emergency drill
number 5!

Gas off!
[ Alarm ]

Helmet on dummy!

Dummy ready!

[ Glass breaking ]

I've gotta get
windows that open!

[ Student: ]
Mr. Duncan,
throw out the beaker!

Ohhh!

Take cover!!

That was close!

[ Loud boom ]

[ Alarm fades ]

[ Screaming ]

Everybody alright?

Okay, new rule--

from now on, never cork
a beaker without permission.

Go, go--
go, go.

Hey, come here.

Watch this.

My brother George says
get every ounce of leverage

anyway you can.

Why him?

'Cuz I already
got the goods on him.

Hey, kid--come here.

Hey, what's happening?

I figure we already
initiated you yesterday,

so we might as well
let you in the club.

Yeah, really.

Thanks.

Here's your jacket.

Cool!

You owe me!

George, it's not
that big a deal.

Yeah, well, let's see
how big a deal it is

when I fire you
for insubordination!

[ Timidly ]
Well, there is that.

[ Knocking softly ]

Oh, thank goodness.

Will, yeah,
come on in, sit down.

Uh, Will, umm, only you
can take responsibility

for what happened.

I mean, we're not--

We're not not training
Navy SEALS here!

No, sir.

But, you know,
someone could have been--

Someone could
have been killed!

Well, that's
doubtful, sirs.

But an accident
like this--

It's what caused
the Chernobyl melt-down!

Well, technically...

I am truly sorry
for what happened

and will gladly pay
for all of the damage.

[ Phone rings ]

What?

[ Mumbling ]
Chernobyl...?

Nice skates.

I was thinking about
getting my kids some.

[ Indistinct ]

Obviously your principal
likes you,

but as chairman
of the school board,

I have to protect
the students!

I apologize.

Let me take this home.

I can fix it for you.

No, I'll just trash it.

It was left behind
by a low-life tenant.

Obviously, she thought
it was as worthless

as I think you are.

Everything's
worth something, sir.

Then take it.

Oh, I couldn't
take it.

Other teachers might
see that as favoritism.

But I can give you, uh,
say, five dollars for it.

Will, I am suspending
you without pay

pending further investigation
of this incident.

Can he do that?

I just did that!

Now give me another five bucks
and the globe is yours.

Will, let me
give you a hand.

Let's see you save
that ten grand now, Will.

Dumb and dumber.

[ Laughing wickedly ]

My husband
had a stroke,

and we just don't know
where the money is.

But we have it.

My husband didn't
trust banks to save money.

Just because we were evicted
from our apartment

doesn't mean
we have bad credit.

Look,
I need this loan.

We really need this loan.

[ Clocking
ticking loudly ]

Hey, Will,
I'm stylin'.

I've hit pay dirt.

That's nice.

I made it with the
king of middle school.

I got into the club
with the cool kids.

Well, congratulations,
Dustin,

but I coulda told ya already
you were pretty cool.

So, c'mon,
what do you really think?

I think you should
just accept yourself

for who you are.

Yeah, right.

Hey, you got some new
old stuff?

Yeah, yeah,
look at this.

This is one
of Thomas Edison's

original experiments
that failed.

You know, he experienced
an awful lot of failure

before he
finally succeeded.

Man, you have
such cool stuff here.

Hey, I bet you could
sell it all and make a ton.

Sell it?

Well, yeah,
why not?

Sell it...

I bet you could
make enough to marry Annie.

That would be so great.

Just picture the look
on my dad's face.

[ Chuckling ]

I'll do it.

I'll do it for Annie!

[ Indistinct chatter ]

That plant
should go there...

or that should go there...

No, that...I don't know.

Maybe...no...yeah,
that should--

that will go there.

Yeah, okay?

â™ª I learned algebra
and geometry,â™ª

â™ª I even learned the theory
of pathagory. â™ª

â™ª This feeling I'm having
is making sense to me, â™ª

â™ª Hey, Mr. Einstein,
is this relativity? â™ª

â™ª My heart's up here
where my head used to sit, â™ª

â™ª I thought I knew anatomy,
but this ain't it. â™ª

â™ª My summa cum laude,
it don't mean spit. â™ª
Open for business.

â™ª There ain't no answers
in my physics kit. â™ª

â™ª Whoa, lovin' you
proves all the rules, â™ª

â™ª Every little theory
from every little school. â™ª

â™ª I've checked it out
under the microscope. â™ª

Hello there, ma'am,
how are you?

â™ª But what I've discovered
is that I still have hope. â™ª
How much
ya gonna pay me?

How's six bucks an hour
once we start selling something.

I'm kinda broke
right now.

Just keep track
of your hours, okay.

This is as good as gold.

â™ª So now I'm about
to matriculate â™ª

â™ª From the U of You,
so let's set a date. â™ª

â™ª There are many more courses
that I need to do â™ª

â™ª To get a master's in amore
and a doctorate in you. â™ª

â™ª Now, there's only one job
that I'm equipped to do, â™ª

â™ª And that's amass a small
fortune so I can get to you. â™ª

â™ª Penny after penny till you
finally answer "I do." â™ª

Antiques you'd recognize.

Ohh...

â™ª If you've got the time,
I've got the place. â™ª

â™ª Just a little homework,
I wanna study your face, â™ª

â™ª And enroll in a class
called Remedial Love 101. â™ª

â™ª Remedial Love 101. â™ª

â™ª Remedial Love 101. â™ª

That's not funny.

That's not funny.

[ Bell ]

Hi, I'm Annie.

May I help you?

Sarah Turhune--
Writer for Antiquities Magazine.

I'll show myself around.

Well...that is a really
interesting hat.

Well, thank you.

It takes a person with culture
to appreciate it.

I'll be right back
if you need anything.

Hey, Dusty,
you know what this is?

No.

It's the original
butter churn

used by the very first
Buttercream Gang.

You know the story?

Over a hundred years ago
a raid killed a lot of men

in this town,

and the minister
asked some boys

to help the widows
churn their cream into butter.

I don't know what
I would have done

without the Buttercreamers
when I was your age, Dusty.

I mean,
I was an orphan.

You didn't have parents?

Oh, of course
I had parents.

I was just an orphan.

Anyway, I was really
struggling with life

when the leader
of the Buttercream Gang

gave me this.

He told me
it stood for honesty,

hard work and charity.

His faith in me
really changed my life.

I told him
I'd pass it along

to a worthy kid
when I met one.

I want you to have it.

Here, take it home.

You're giving this to me?

Thanks, Will!

Wow!

You are so great.

Oh, gee whiz.

We have a customer.

I want you to meet her.

Yeah.

Yes!

That'll sell...

[ Quietly ]
Oh, be sure
to notice her hat.

Will, this is
Sarah Turhune.

She's a writer
of Antiquities Magazine.

Sarah, this is Will.

He's the owner
of the store.

Ahh.

Nice to meet you.

So what do you think?

I think you'll be pleased
with my review.

So, honestly,
do you like my hat?

Honestly?

Honestly...

You're a very distinguished
and cultured woman,

I am sure...

but that is the ugliest
hat I've ever seen.

Excuse me.

Ahhhh!

Oh, oh, oh,
Miss Turhune,

I'm so sorry!

Oh!

I apologize.

You clumsy
oafish man!

Oh!

Obviously, I was wrong!

This is certainly
not the kind

of quaint treasure trove
for my readers!

Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Great business
mind, Will.

I'm sure you'll save
ten grand in no time.

Mrs. Turhune,
wait!

Please don't leave.

Looks like you're off
to a stellar start, Will.

Well, it was
an ugly hat.

But probably
very expensive.

You know,
there's a fine line

between antiques
and...junk.

Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha...

Who's going to buy
the antlers, Will?

Hmmm?

A frustrated
deer hunter?

Oh, yeah,
and I'm sure everybody's

just dying to buy this.

Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha...

Hey, what about
this stupid thing.

What is this?

Is there a
Will Duncan here?

Yes,
that's me.

Oh, I've been looking
for you a long time.

I don't think I
would have found you

without this flyer.

Mr. Duncan,
I am the Curator

of the Toledo Children's
Museum of Fine Art.

We believe
you purchased a painting

at an estate sale.

Oh, yes.

There it is!

Magnificent!

Uh, what are you
asking for it?

Tell him ten bucks and you'll
break even on the globe.

Well, I was hoping
that you would be willing

to part with it for, say...
five thousand dollars?

Now, of course,
I know that it is worth

far more than that,

but I was hoping you'd
do it for the children.

Yes, certainly Mr...?

Smith.

Yes, we'll definitely
do it for the children,

won't we, Will.

You know, I only paid
fifty bucks for it last year.

And, uh, it was only worth
fifty dollars last year,

but you know
the art world.

Now, if you'll crate
and ship it to me

at this address, I would
be most appreciative.

Of course.

Thank you!

Five thousand dollars!

Mr. Hampton, I have you
to thank for this!

Without you, none of this
would have happened.

We're halfway there.

Isn't this wonderful?

To celebrate,
I'm gonna take you

to that new
fancy-pants restaurant

on 5th St. tomorrow night--
8 p.m., invite your parents.

Okay, but...
you'd better not be late.

â™ªâ™ª Hey, everybody, you better
hold on to your seat, â™ª

â™ª Cuz in the ring now stands
a champ, he can't be beat. â™ª

â™ª Floats like a butterfly
and stings like a bee, â™ª

â™ª Hey, Mr. Ali,
this one you've gotta see. â™ª

Rock 'n' roll!

â™ª He's the champion,
100% All-American, Superman. â™ª

â™ª Superman, Super--Superman. â™ª

â™ª Only the champ can
take it to Jordan â™ª

â™ª With one hand
behind his back. â™ª

â™ª Whooaa. â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Like Joe Montana,
his aim is straight and true. â™ª

â™ª Ain't no one faster, â™ª

â™ª He leaves them
in their shoes. â™ª

â™ª He's got the prize now,
the championship ring. â™ª

â™ª He's got your heart, girl,
he's gonna make you sing. â™ª
[ Rip ! ]

â™ª He's the champion, â™ª
[ Rip ! ]

â™ª Doing things that
no other human can. â™ª

â™ª Superman,
Super--Superman... â™ª

Caution: The contents
of this finely-crafted crate

are estimated
at five thousand dollars.

Handle with care.

That's good.

Aghhhhhh!!

[ Dogs barking ]

He shoots!

He scores!

[ Laughing ]

Oh, man.

Alright.

Hi, guys.

Hey.

Okay...

We've decided that
your first assignment will be

that you'll help
catch a guy

that goes around
robbing phone booths.

A robber?

See, what you see at school
is just our public image,

you know,
so nobody finds out

we secretly
do good deeds.

So what's the plan?

You need
to recruit some kid

that will catch
the crook in the act,

and while he makes
a citizen's arrest on the guy,

you'll go get the cops.

Wow,
this is great!

Hey, Ribby, how would you
like to help catch a robber?

So they go to jail?

Yeah.

Sure!

Meet me at the west end
of the park at 8:00 tonight.

Well, Harry,
minor setback.

I mean, it's just
five grand, right?

We needed ten,
after all.

Oh, this meal's
gonna break me.

Well, I'll tell you one thing--

I am not gonna be
late tonight.

No, sir--
on-time Willy.

Oooh, some extra coins.

Oh,
I've got time.

Harry, just hang out here
for me, will you, buddy.

Oh, yeah.

Get rid of some of this here.

[ Garbage disposal ]

[ Grinding ]

[ Bang ]

Oh, ah, ah, ah-ah.

[ Grinding continues ]

[ Moaning and groaning ]

He's got
fifteen minutes.

[ Clock chiming ]

I'll call.

No, wait,
he canceled his phone...

to save money.

Will is...well,
he's a man of principle.

So is George.

In fact, I think
he used to be a principal.

And he also helped
Will get suspended.

Now, don't blame
that on George.

Will was out of control.

Well, I'm sure he has every-
thing under control now.

[ Grinding ]

Did you know
from almost nothing,

George has built several
apartment complexes.

I don't care
what we owns!

And I don't care
if he drives a Fellini.

He may have money,
but Will has heart.

Well...

And he's smart, too.

I have seen him get out
of impossible situations.

B-b-b-b-b-b-b.

Well, that's a new one.

Oh, Harry...

[ Disposal quits ]

Okay, thirteen minutes.

We're good.

[ Doorbell rings ]

Just wait here, Harry,
while I get the door.

I'm an adult.

I have a job.

If I choose to marry Will,
then I will,

whether he saves
a million pennies or not.

Oh, honey, just give that
enterprising George a chance

and he'll
sweep you off your feet.

[ Glass breaking ]

Beatrice,
control yourself!

Guess what--I put the
butter maker in my bedroom.

It looks really cool
on the ledge.

Hey, aren't you
taking Annie

and my parents
out to dinner?

Yeah, yeah,
I'm in a big hurry.

Now where are those Blades?

[ Crash ]

Oh, ah, ah...

Hello, hello...

Whoa, whoa, Dust...

Oh, man...

Oh, man,
where'd this come from?

Okay, give me
a hand at this.

If I can just get
my fingers in this seam...

Oh...oh-oh-oh.

It's beautiful.

Wow!

He is the one
that invited us to dinner!

The least he could do
is show up on time!

Obviously, he thinks there
are other things more important.

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Jackpot--yes!

Look at this, Dusty!

[ Laughing and cheering ]

Oh yeah, we're rich,
we're rich...

[ Laughing ]

Ohhh...

Thank you.

[ Clears throat ]
Now we'll establish
our reputation,

get respect,
prove our worth.

Prove our wor...

I can marry Annie.

I can marry Annie!

â™ª Daisies, roses,
bask in the sun, â™ª

â™ª Everything
grows in our love. â™ª

â™ª Two hearts, one love,
blossoms anew, â™ª

â™ª Blossoms for me
and you. â™ª

â™ª One by one
the little darlings come, â™ª

â™ª Suzie, Timmy, Johnny,
aren't they fun. â™ª

â™ª Suddenly our little house
feels like home. â™ª

â™ª Everyday is
such a sunny day, â™ª

â™ª Everyone I
meet along the way â™ª

â™ª Tells me--
always and always, â™ª

â™ª Forever it's
me and it's you. â™ª

[ Dusty: ]
What are you doing? â™ª

Not kissing
your sister...again.

A hundred
and fifty thousand...

We're rich!

No, we're not.

We're not?

The question is--
where did this money come from,

and who does it
really belong to?

Uh, it belongs
to you, Will.

Nah, I don't think so.

I bought the globe
from Mr. Hampton.

You're not thinking
the money belongs to--oh, gag!

No, the money belongs

to whoever
put it in the globe.

Are you kidding?

Finder keepers,
loser weepers.

Not good enough.

One hundred fifty thousand,
Will.

Come on,
you gotta keep it.

Dustin, if you found
a wallet on the sidewalk,

you'd try to find
its owner, wouldn't you?

Is this a test?

Mr. Hampton said
he got the globe from a--

a "she" who rented
one of his apartments.

Maybe that's
who it belongs to.

Look, you bought
the globe,

so you own
the money inside of it.

Come on,
do it for Annie, Will!

It isn't right.

What's right is returning
the money to its owner.

Can't you see? It's--
it's God's will.

It's fate!

Angels are guiding you.

No--no go.

I'll take it with me
to dinner tonight

and then Annie and I
will go over to George's

and we'll ask him who
the original owner was.

You're not serious!

Grow a brain!

And then,
what are you gonna say

when he asks you
why you want to know?

The truth.

[ Groans ]

Oh gosh,
look at the time.

I think you
should go dry off.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm outta here.

Oh, wait, wait, wait.

Take this quarter,
call Annie.

Tell them I'll meet them
at the restaurant.

Okay.

Catch you later!

Oh, can't let you
out of my sight.

[ Ringing ]

Where are you?

'Kay, bye.

He's meeting us
at the restaurant.

Ah-huh!

Where is that
science teacher?

Four dining
this evening?

Uh, yes.

He should
be here soon.

Very good.

[ Crash ]

Oh please...

No, I'm not looking.

I'm not looking.

I can't stop.

I don't have time.

I cannot afford to be late.

[ Glass breaking ]

Ohh,
Annie's gonna kill me!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Stop!

Hooligan!

Oooh...

Okay, Ribby, go!

What a nice
surprise!

George, are you meeting
somebody for dinner?

No, I'm actually
dining alone tonight.

I just couldn't take

That quiet 10,000-square-
foot house any more.

Join us,
won't you, dear?

No, I-I
couldn't impose.

We don't mind,
do we, dear?

Well,
if you insist!

I'll save these
for the police.

Halt!

Ohhhh!

Ah, ah, ahhh!

Hey, Harry,
what are you doing here?

Halt!

This is a
citizen's arrest,

you, robber, you!

No, no,
I'm not a thief.

I'm--ohh...

[ Moaning ]

He-he's mutating!

Welcome.

My name is Wesley.

What shall I
serve you this eve...ning?

We'll start with the
Prize Fighter appetizer.

I've only
nine tables to serve,

so don't
let me rush you.

Sir?

The lady would like
salmon, I--the chicken.

Chicken!

An adventurous
choice.

And to drink?

I'll have a mineral
water with lime.

Yes, for me as well.

I'm on a health kick.

Lately, I've been
trying to get down

to my old fighting weight.

Grant me strength.

I'm only collecting
these coins

for the police,
really.

A rat!

No, he's just a gerbil.

Here, look.

Ahhh, uhhh...

A killer rat!

[ Imagined growl ]

Ahhhh, ahhhhh!

[ Crying
and screaming ]

You're looking sufficiently
trim and robust to me, George.

Very trim and robust.

Well, I've been--
been working out.

Disciplined.

Yes, now that we're
all sufficiently clear

on the gentlemen's
discipline...

Don't, George.

What are you gonna do--
punch me out?

[ Laughing ]

Go ahead, give me
your best shot.

C'mon.

I'm serious--c'mon.

Confident,
just like you.

C'mon, go ahead,
go ahead.

[ Indistinct chatter
in restaurant ]

Ouch!

Good shot, Miss.

Annie!

I am so sorry, George.

I did not mean to do that.

[ Muffled ]
No, it's okay, really.

It's okay.

Wow!

What a right hook!

Whooo!

I haven't been
beaned like that

since--
since college.

Woo-hoo.

Could we carry on?

In the hopes
of finishing up here

and getting you all back
to the trailer park.

I always knew you
were extraordinary, but...

Whoo.

Sir, is there
anything else?

A sprits or a
sponge bath perhaps?

Another place setting.

There's another one
on his way.

Certainly, miss.

I'm--I'm ecstatic
at the thought

of mollycoddling
another of your kind.

Sorry.

Gotcha!

Look at this place.

Sir, may I?

To a wonderful
family,

and to a
wonderful evening.

To us--
the wonderful people!

[ Chuckling ]

[ Indistinct chatter ]

[ Laughing ]

Looks like Will
finally made it.

[ Waiter: ]
Sir, sir!

Will, what are
you doing?

What are you doing?

Oh, Will...

I apologize for being
as late as I am,

but something
very urgent came up.

Umm, Mr. Hampton do you
remember who that belonged to.

You said a woman left it behind
in one of your apartments.

Uh, gee, Will,
don't recall.

Why?

Well, I--I found...

A rat!

AGHHHHH!

No, no, no--it's okay.

It's--it's just a gerbil.

Enjoy your meals.

Sir,
I must ask you

and the rat
to leave immediately!

Uh, I'm very sorry.

I-I just--If I could
just get the globe.

Get out!

Out!

There he is!

That's the illegal space alien
with the killer rat.

Good job, Rudy.

You're through, Will.

Kitty litter.

Dead meat.

Papooski!

[ Laughing ]

[ Squeaking ]

Ahh--aahhhh!

[ Crash ]

[ Screaming ]

Get it off,
get it offff!

Ahhhh!

He wouldn't
hurt a fly.

Oh, yeah?

That's what the guy
in Psycho said!

[ Police officer: ]
Okay, okay.

The circus is over.

You're under arrest.

Wha...

It was--
It was on me!

And now it's gone.

Anything you say can
and will be used against you

in the court of law.

[ George: ]
What's going on here?

He stole quarters
from a phone booth!

They're in his pockets.

This is all a mistake.

Oh, yeah?

What do you
call this...huh?!
[ Quarters jingling ]

It doesn't look
like a mistake to me.

[ Will: ]
Hey, that was
to pay for dinner!

I-I-I kept these others
for the police.

There's a note
on the phone booth.

Is this the man
you want for a husband?!

Mr. Farnsworthy,
I am not a thief.

It's all
a misunderstanding.

This must be very
difficult for you.

I feel your pain.

[ Will: ]
My globe.

Hey, that's not yours.

Officer,
that is not his!

Whatcha worried
about, Will?

It's just a globe.

Finders keepers.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

C'mon.

Uh...

[ Indistinct chatter ]

[ Man: ]
Check please.

Could I get my check?

Could I get my check
over here, please?

Waiter, me too--
check, please.

[ Crying ]

[ Bored ]
Remove the space helmet.

Let's try it again.

Wait, let's try it again
without the killer rat.

Remove the skates.

Let's try it again.

Okay,
Class A Misdemeanor,

But I see no priors, so we can
release you on your own recog.

If you need an attorney,
here's the number for legal aid.

Or if you want a good lawyer,
I got a brother-in-law

who just passed the bar
over the Internet.

He's clean.

Okay, you can collect
your space helmet,

your killer rat, and your globe
at the front desk.

Have a pleasant night.

[ Baby crying ]

[ Sirens ]

[ Bell ringing ]

[ Bang ]

Dusty!

He's still sleeping.

And I'm going out to buy
a plane ticket to Tibet.

Have fun.

And I'm going to rob
a bank to pay for it.

I'll be joining the
Tibetan Liberation Army

when I get there.

That's nice, dear.

Oh, but, honey,
be home by 6:00.

Your father has invited
George over again.

Why don't you just
have him move in?!

I know it's hard now,

but soon everything
will be just hunky-dory.

George can provide
for all your needs.

Really?

And how is it that
you know what I need?

A mother knows.

Just give him a chance and
he'll sweep you off your feet.

Alright!

That's it.

Give me the book.

[ Sternly ]
Mother.

Mom, look.

Mom, look at this.

I can't believe
my science teacher's

being carted away
by the cops.

Doesn't that look
like our old globe.

[ Groaning ]

Sherm?!

He moved his hand!

Yes, dear?

What is it?

[ Struggling ]
Th--the money...

The money--the money?

Sweetheart,
where's the money?

In--

the--

world.

The world?

The guh,

gulo-o-buh.

In the gulo-buh?

The--the globe?

All the money in the globe.

The money's
in the globe?!

Duh...

[ Laughing ]
Duh, duh!

Look at this.

Hey, check this guy out.

It serves him right
for giving me a D.

Nice job!

Too bad you didn't
get the credit you deserve.

Will!

You guys said it was
going to be a thief,

and Will's no thief!

You guys set him up.

You set him up.

We're witnesses.

Surprise!

We all saw you
steal that jacket too.

You gave this to me.

No, you stole it.

Got it all in video.

It's funny
how the tape ends

right when you stuff it
into your backpack.

Now you're
really one of us.

So you open your mouth,
and your dad will find out.

You'll get
kicked out of school

and thrown in Juvie,

just like the last kid
who ratted on us.

[ Court clerk: ]
All rise.

Third District court
is now in session.

The Honorable Benjamin
T. Farnsworthy presiding.

Be seated.

At--At 8:20 p.m.,
that man there...

He hit the telephone box
and all this money spilled out.

And he started
scooping it up

like a crazy
Space man or something.

[ Prosecutor: ]
Your witness.

Now, Mr... Ribby,
did you see anybody else

in the phone booth,
before me?

No.

You were just
trying to do your duty

as a citizen,
weren't ya?

Yeah.

Well, good job, Ribby.

You're obviously a--
a person of character.

I just wish more citizens could
get involved like you did.

Very good.

I have--
no further questions.

You may step down.

Do you have any witnesses
on your behalf, Mr. Duncan?

Oh, Your Honor, I know how
I can prove my innocence

if you'll just
let me tell my story.

[ Prosecutor: ]
No objections, Your Honor.

Raise your right hand.

Whoops.

Do you swear
to tell the truth,

the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

Absolutely!

Proceed.

[ Clears throat ]
Uh, last week
I purchased this globe

from one Mr. George Hampton.

Yesterday,
I discovered this globe

contained one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars in cash.

Last night I was on my way
to see George to ask him

who the original owner was
so I could return the money

to its rightful owner.

That's when I stopped

because I saw--somebody
robbing the phone booth.

Now, why would I
rob the phone booth

when I could have very easily
just kept all that money?

Your Honor,
that's my globe.

I only
found out today

it was where my husband
kept all of our savings.

It's--It's yours,
Mrs. Andrews?

Well, here--
take it then, please.

Bailiff, will you return
the globe to its owner.

The court agrees.

Mr. Duncan had no reason
to steal the quarters

if he is trying to return

one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars to its rightful owners.

Prosecution--it is evident

that you don't have
a case against Mr. Duncan.

It is, therefore, my decision
that as of this time...

The money's not here!

It's just newspaper!

Where's my money?!

I don't understand.

It was all there yesterday.

I promise
the money was there.

He stole my money!

[ Prosecutor: ]
Your Honor, the state
charges Will Duncan

with a Class B Felony,

and requests that he be taken
immediately into custody.

So ordered.

Bail is set at one thousand
five hundred dollars.

Court adjourned.

[ Banging of Gavel ]

Annie, Annie--
don't take it too hard.

Everybody lies
sometime everyday...

Even Presidents.

Open Alpha.

Somebody posted
your bail, Will.

Who?

Don't know.

Come on, I'll help you
get your things.

Hey, guys,
what's going on?

Annie found a mess.

She says the police
were looking for something.

Thanks for the help.

What are
the Buttercreamers for?

That's right.

Well, guys,
you better get to school

or you're gonna be late.

Alright.

Thanks.

See ya later.

See ya.

See you guys later.

Thanks.

Oh, they appointed
me a--an attorney.

Uh, gotta go
meet him.

Will...

Do you know
where the money is?

What?!

You know, Annie,
the fact that even--

you would
question me just--

just shows you don't
really know me.

Will!

Wait!

[ Doorbell ]

Well, who sprung ya
from the hoosegow?

I thought maybe you did...
out of guilt.

Fat chance.

Did your lawyer
send you?

Yes.

[ Chuckling ]
I don't have
the money, Will,

but I am gonna
get the prize.

Annie's going to need
a lot of comforting...

[ Whispering ]
...while you're gone.

Serrassasalmus
spilopleura.

No, Will, George Jr.
is a piranha,

and he loves gerbils.

Haven't Piranhas been illegal
since the late sixties.

I don't know
what kind of game

you're playing
with me here, Will,

but this
conversation's over.

Wait.

I need a favor.

Will you please
end my suspension?

Why certainly, Will.

I'll end it right now.

[ Laughing ]

[ Door being locked ]

You're fired!!

Georgie?

Georgie, did that mean old
man agitate you, Georgie?

Hmmm?

[ Growl ]

Ahhhhh!

Ahh--ahhhhh!

Attention students,
this is your princi-pal.

[ Chuckling ]

Science teacher
Will Duncan...

Former science teacher.

...has been charged
with a Class A Misdemeanor.

A felony!

It was a felony!

And I assure you that
this gross injustice

that has taken
place will be...

Ow, that's gonna
leave a mark!

Get off!

[ Ripping sound ]

Great...

Hey, look who
still thinks he's in.

Actually, I'm out.

I quit your club.

Too late--
we kicked you out!

Is it okay
if I sit here?

I'm really sorry for
how I've treated you.

Okay...

[ Knocking ]

Mrs. Andrews,
I am so...

I need that money.

Please...

If I had it,
I would give it to ya.

You talk about
having good character.

How dare you get on
your integrity soap box

when what you really are
is a hypocrite and a thief!

One more thing--
I will not allow Maurice

to be in the
Buttercreamers anymore.

Not with you around 'em.

[ George Jr. ]
So you open your mouth
and your dad will find out.

You'll get kicked out of school
and thrown in to Juvie.

[ Doorbell ]

Hey, Dusty.

What are you
doing here?

I'm scared.

Scared of what, bud?

Come on in.

Tell me
what's wrong, Dusty.

I can't.

People will find out.

I promise not to tell a soul,
no matter what it is.

[ Dusty: ]
I should have known
something was wrong

when they said that all I had
to do to get this jacket

was a good deed.

That's not
the worst thing I did.

[ Will's voice: ]
Dusty, you can tell me.

I won't tell.

I promise not to tell.

I made a promise.

[ Alarm ringing ]

[ Defense Attorney ]
Are you sure this is the globe
where your husband hid

the one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars?

Absolutely.

No further questions,
Your Honor.

[ Judge: ]
You may step down.

[ Protestors, together: ]
Free Will!

Free Will!

Free Will!

Free Will!

Free Will!

[ Banging of gavel ]

Order!

Free Will!

Free Will!

[ Gavel ]

Order!

Order!

Order
in the court!

This court
will come to order!

I'd like now to call
Mr. Will Duncan to the stand.

[ Whispering ]
Okay, you go get 'em, Tiger.

[ Whispering ]
I don't know.

[ Clerk ]
Raise your right hand.

Do you swear
to tell the truth,

the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

I'll try.

Just answer yes or no.

Do you swear
to tell the truth,

the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?!

I will, if I can.

Oh, good grief!

What kind of
commitment is that?

Uh, Your Honor, uh,

may I have a moment
with my client, please?

One minute.

[ Whispering ]
This judge is mean.

He eats rattlesnakes
for lunch--fangs and all.

He'll send you to the big house,
do you understand?

Now, you gotta say yes.

Say yes!

[ Clears throat ]

Do you swear
to tell the truth,

the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

I do...unless I've otherwise
made a promise not to.

[ Judge: ]
Mr. Duncan,
you are in contempt!

I will not have you
make a mockery of my court!

Bailiff, throw Mr. Duncan
in the cooler

to give him a little time
to think about what he's doing!

Fifteen-minute recess!

[ Bang ]

[ Indistinct
chatter and moaning ]

What are you
doing, Will?

You've gotta
tell your story.

I can't.

I made a promise.

But if you
don't say anything,

they're going
to think you're guilty.

Mmm...but you and I
will know I'm not.

Honesty may not always seem
to pay off in this lifetime,

but I'd rather be
an honest man in jail

than a dishonest
man who's free.

I made a promise to you
and I'm not gonna break it.

Then promise me this--

promise me that you'll
make everything okay.

[ Clerk ]
The Judge is ready.

Promise me!

I'm sorry, Dustin.

I can't do that.

Raise your
right hand.

Do you promise
to tell the truth,

the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

Ohhh...

[ Moaning ]

Does the prosecution
have any other witnesses?

No, Your Honor.

Defense?

No, Your Honor.

Then I have
no other choice

but to find Will Duncan
guilty as charged

and to
sentence him to...

Wait a minute!

I need
to say something.

No!

Swear him in.

[ Indistinct chatter ]

Raise your
right hand.

Do you...

I do.

[ Applauding ]

[ Judge: ]
Order!

[ Gavel ]

Order!

Go ahead.

I used to think
that Will was pretty goofy

for being so honest.

But then I realized
that if I was always honest,

I wouldn't have anything
to be afraid of.

So from now on,
I'm gonna be as honest as Will,

who would go to jail before he
would break his promise to me.

Will didn't rob
that phone booth.

Rudy and his gang used
Ribby and me to set him up.

Your Honor, this witness
is not credible.

I have evidence here
showing him stealing

a very expensive jacket
from a local store.

[ Indistinct chatter ]

Thanks.

Now I don't have
to say that one.

I can't prove
that I put the jacket back.

Sometimes being scared
makes you do things

that you know are wrong,

even if you don't want to.

And well, you see...

I took the money
from the globe.

[ Crowd gasps ]

Not Will.

[ Crowd gasps ]

[ Judge: ]
Bailiff,
will you count the cash.

Anyway,
I only took the money

because I knew
that George Hampton

would try
to trick Will out of it.

I apologize for
all the hurt I've caused.

And if anyone
should go to jail,

it should be me, not Will.

You may step down.

That took great courage--
on both your parts, gentlemen.

I suspect there's
more to this story

than we've heard today.

I hereby direct
the District Attorney

to further investigate.

But as to the matter
before this court today,

all charges against
Will Duncan are dismissed.

[ Cheering and applause ]

Court is adjourned.

I'm sorry.

Thanks, Dusty.

See, now we're
both free.

Absolutely!

[ Laughing ]

Will--I'm sorry.

No...

Thank you...

Thank you both.

Oh, George...

See that crowd, George?

Yes, Mr. Farnsworthy.

My guess is they're
going to hang you by your heels

if you don't give
Will his job back.

Yes, Mr. Farnsworthy.

And maybe even a little raise.

Yes, Mr. Farnsworthy.

Mr. Farnsworthy?

Yes, George.

What about Annie?

Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

Case dismissed.

[ Gavel ]

[ Crying ]

Uh, Will,
do you remember me?

Yeah, the writer.

I am really a major antique
wholesaler from New York.

I never admit
to that normally.

Not only are you the most
honest man I have ever met--

ohh, that hat
was ghastly, wasn't it?

But you have the most eclectic
collection of antique items

I have ever seen.

Oh, thanks.

As agreed--nine thousand
five hundred dollars, even.

Oh, thank you, Sarah.

I hope you've forgiven me.

Of course.

Thank you.

This is for all
your romance novels.

Thank you!

Will--just sweep her
off her feet

and everything
will be hunky-dory.

[ Annie: ]
He already has...

[ Will: ]
...and it already is.

He's very enterprising.

Okay, don't forget
to subtract sales tax.

And Dustin
worked eight hours,

so subtract 48 bucks.

[ Annie: ]
Minus what you owe
Dusty equals...

Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety nine dollars

and ninety-nine cents.

[ Dusty: ]
That's almost it!

You're just
one penny short!

Does anyone
have a penny?

Uh, Mr. Farnsworthy,
that's not a...

Yes, it is, Will.

I guess you have
a million pennies now.

I'm sorry.
I can't take it.

Will, please accept
a gift from a foolish man

who didn't understand
that an honest heart

is more important
than any amount of money.

I can only hope
that now you see me

as worthy to be
your father-in-law.

Yes!

Yes!

Ah, baby...

Thank
you..., Dad.

I'm sorry.

[ Laughing ]

My boy!

Now you may
kiss the Bride.

You're sure?

[ Cheering ]

Oh, Ben,
did you see the way

he just swept her
off her feet?!

â™ª Oh,
Pack all your dreams,

â™ª Throw in
a little ambition. â™ª

â™ª Don't forget
the vision,â™ª

â™ª Now off we go. â™ª

â™ª Oh, give it a whirl, â™ª

â™ª No matter where
in the world it finds us,â™ª

â™ª We've got our
love to bind us... â™ª

â™ª It's all the riches
we need. â™ª

â™ª Searching the world. â™ª

â™ª I found
the right equation, â™ª

â™ª It took
some rearrangin' â™ª

â™ª 'til I finally found you. â™ª

â™ª Yeah, my world
is turned upside down, â™ª

â™ª Two plus two
equals three to me. â™ª

â™ª With a penny
in my pocket, â™ª

â™ª Feeling rich can be. â™ª

â™ª It's all making
sense to me. â™ª

â™ª Well,
I'm living a dream, â™ª

â™ª Ain't nothing
gonna stop this, â™ª

â™ª Ain't nothing
gonna top this, â™ª

â™ª Now that you answered
"I do." â™ª

â™ª Just bring on the world, â™ª

â™ª Ain't nothing
we can't do here, â™ª

â™ª Now that
I have you, dear, â™ª

â™ª All the world
is a dream. â™ª

â™ª I'll have it all â™ª

â™ª If after all â™ª

â™ª The trouble
I've been through, â™ª

â™ª I've got you, yeah. â™ª

â™ª I've got you! â™ª
