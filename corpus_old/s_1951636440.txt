I don't need them. Neither
do the rest of the fellows

Of course not! Sometimes!

What do you think? No!

No, no!

But how many times does it take?

I have eight older sisters
and one brother

father took tapir balls all
ten times

shall I tell him?

I'm sorry. The balls are useless

you've never had them? Couldn't
tell you what they taste like.

None ofyou?

No, but it's
been fun watching you...

Get him off me!

Calm down!

Why do you let them treat
you like this?

Be strong

It all works... yes?

Yes...

i just can't make children.

There is something
I will tell you...

...but I warn you, it's
very powerful

The soanzo leaf

the soanzo leaf?

From the great marshes
in the south...

this is what gave me my
ten children

no! No! Wait...

you have to rub them on...
down there

i don't know how to thank you.

If this works... maybe she'll
stop bothering me

No, her mother

the old hag wants grandchildren

...pure meat...

ball breath

what do you want?

What do you want?

I am flint sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age

my father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

Jaguar paw. My son

he hunts this forest with me

he will hunt it with his
son after I am gone

a good catch/

good waters here

the forest gives much here

we ask only to pass through

pass.

Keep safe as you pass.

Let's go.

Our lands were ravaged.

We seek a new beginning.

Your lands were ravaged?

Yes...

we seek a new beginning...

be still my son!

Be still

back to the village

i ask you not to speak of what
you saw in the forest today

you are troubled

yes. I am

those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

I do not understand.

Fear

deep rotting fear.

They were infected by it.

Did you see?

Fear is a sickness

it will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it

it has tainted your peace already.

I did not raise you to see
you live with fear

strike it fromyour heart

do not bring it into our
village.

At first light we will gather
with the elder...

...at the sacred hill
of our fathers

there we will call on
their spirits to guide us

oh here he is!

The big lump!

He's useless.

He can't do it.

You! Yes you!

With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us

get inside!

Damn you! Get in there!

Old woman, please

move it!

You don't work!

What are you laughing about!

Give me a grandchild or
I will have you replaced

mother, that's enough

do not come out until
you make a child

two would be better what?

Twins you oaf

mother

can you go away? He says he can't
with you sitting there

just get busy

mom...

she's gone

mother, what do you say we should
have ate the feast tonight?

I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

I say boy! Rosted!

The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh

no dad! No! It's me!
It's me!

I'll just hang the boy here in case
we change our minds

wait...

that's our turtles run.
That's our eldest

yes it's me it's your eldest!

In that case a crush for
my eldest...

...and a crush for my youngest.

Tapir it is.

One day, old man!

One day you won't be
able to run anymore!

And a man sat alone

drenched deep in sadness.

And all the animals drew near
to him and said:

We do not like to see you so sad...

ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it.

The man said I want to have
good sight.

The vulture replied: You
shall have mine

the man said: I want to be
strong

the jaguar said:

You shall be strong like me

then the man said I long to
know the secrets of the earth

the serpent replied: I will
show them to you

and so it went with all the animals

and when the man had all the gifts
that they could give...

...he left

then the owl said to the other
animals:

Now the man knows much and is able
to do many things...

suddenly I am afraid.

The deer said: The man has
all that he needs.

Now his sadness will stop

but the owl replied: No

i saw a hole in the man...

deep like a hunger he will
never fill...

it is what makes him sad
and what makes him want

he will go on taking and
taking...

until one day the world
will say:

I am no more and I have
nothing left to give

come back to me...

come back to me

my son is dancing

your son is happy

what do you want?

Run!

Now thatyou're up,
can you please kill that dog?

The dog

with the rest of us

...it's yours

it has taken many lives

get some rest

resting brothers...

...fathters, mothers, wives

you felt the cold of this day's
early morning

now you cannot feel the coldness
of its night

she stopped screaming...

...too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming

we saw how she fought them

but in the final moment?

If she let them...

...the goddess of the scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

her soul waits for yours in the
shade of the ceiba tree

I need to know

before this day's end I will
leave this world

I will take as many of these
bastard dogs with me as I can

and I will gladly embrace the
torments of hell...

...if I do not find my sky
flower there

don't rain

I am walking here

keep away she has the sickness

get back!

You fear me?

So you should...

...all you who are vile

would you like to know
how you will die?

The sacred time is near...

beware the blackness of day

beware the man who brings
the jaguar

behold him reborn from mud
and earth...

for the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

...and scratch out the earth

scratch you out

and end your world

he's with us now

...day will be like night

and the man jaguar will lead
you to your end...

where are they taking us?

We tell stories of a place
stone-built

what happens there?

I don't know...

...but the earth bleeds

we are near

salvation!

He has the laughing sickness

he likes you!

Help me!

Save me

die like a man

welcome back

have you been successful?

Ask my son

how many captives?

Deal with my son

a fair price

as always, trust me

good

how much will you give me?

Who will buy this woman?

No... she's too old

she can be useful

she can cook... clean...

useless old woman

no sale

go

go on
