Hello, can you hear me?

He comes tonight.

Julija!

Julija, the cord.

If he stays, we'll see
the terrain tomorrow.

That's right.

We need to take care of it.

I call him.

OK Bye.

Julija, the cord.

This is a private dock!

You can anchor the boat in my bag!

Turkey.

He comes tonight.

He knows where is best for him.

Do you have wine?

Plavac.

Plavac, but good.

The one we drink at Easter.

Delivered here until 14:00.

Did you take anything?

Murina.

Thank God. Help me with this.

I can't take any more orders today.

I know. Please be patient.

Tonight is important.

What was there?

Any.

Look.

I wore this before you were born.

It's beautiful.

In it!
I'm going!

Come clean the fish!
All right.

It's this one?

Go wear what daddy tells you to

Javier is coming. Your
father will be in a good mood.

What is it?

Just some old stuff. Am I
no longer allowed to wear?

Let me go!
What is it?

She bit into her own flesh to free herself.

You're going to buy an apartment
in Zagreb for your kids' college.

This man who comes to my
house tonight is God on Earth.

I know.

We just need to make him happy.

Meet us tomorrow at 11 am in Mana.

At 11 am.
Right.

What is it?

Ivo let you take his boat.
Thanks.

Julija, go wash the chairs.

Stop playing with the water.

Here.

How much is it?
$350.

Your daughter walks
around naked to provoke.

She's covered.
Right.

In it, what wine is this?

Plavac.
Blayer?

What wine does Javier drink?

Plavac.
Which?

Tell me, which one?
I do not know.

Tell me which Plavac does Javier like?

Julija, is that you?

Julija!

Beautiful, like your mother.

Alberto, Nela's daughter.

Albert.
Javi!

In view of!

Martin, you will love this place.

Before...
Javi.

Longing.

Hi, Javi.

Good to see you.

Carla, Martin.

This is Nela, you know her.
I remember. Thanks for coming.

What are you doing
naked? Go get dressed. Fast!

Julija, a little gift from New York.

Smile, you beast, what does it cost you?

Thanks.
No present for Ante. He already has everything.

Thank you, Javi.

I really have.

Our! It's beautiful!

I am fine?

Was it good?

put it on

I don't want it, it's yours.
It's elegant.

It does not matter.
Just today. Trust in me.

If your father sells the land,
we can move to Zagreb.

Let's go.

How is it going? How is he?
He is well.

Drambuie.

Where's Drambuie?

Where the fuck?

This one.

Cups.

I am going home.

Javi...

I want to say how happy I am to
have you here after seven years.

And I'm proud to host your friends.

And that your dinner at my house
will be the last stop on your journey.

I made many mistakes in my life,

but that friendship has always
been one of the greatest... gifts.

I missed you, man.

I missed you.

Ante... He was the best captain I ever had.

We met very young and
went on very crazy adventures.

I cannot speak for the majority
in front of such polite company.

I love this man like a
brother. Long live love.

And as for my father's boat you sunk...

I forgive you.

Julija, levante-se!

Get up and recite the poem I wrote for you!

They don't want to hear it now.

I wrote this poem for you.

Before, not now.
Why not?

Let's go.

I sit on the shore looking at you

Looking from afar where you become the sky

How can I count all the paths and
waves you create with the wind?

I look into your blue depths

What secrets do you hide?

These are the colours that seduce sailors

when someone stays in their stillness?

See you in your bad temper

And I don't trust you

Sea, I don't know how to understand you

In front of you, the sea, I am speechless

She skipped the line! She missed
the best part about her father.

"And when you're at peace,
there's one thing I ask.

You have no right to take my father,
you must always bring him back."

Now say good night.
Enjoy your night.

It's good that they're away.

Imagine going through
this with the kids at home.

I do not know. Is he blind.

For old times' sake.

See that island? I call it Nela's belly.

Well, he feeds me well.

I'm a good fisherman.

It's my best catch.
Ante wins again.

How long will he stay?
As long as you need.

He's here on business,
not to see you misbehave.

Did you know your mother
won a beauty contest?

Yeah, we sailed the
islands before you were born.

She wasn't even registered,
they pulled her out of the audience.

That was a long time ago.

It hasn't been that long.

What if Pavo doesn't sell the land?

You left the fenders in the water.

Amazing, huh? Julija!

The land of Pavo is
from here to the pine tree.

And ours is from the tree on
the right to the end of the bay.

Very good.

The ideal is to have two
lots to build a beautiful resort.

Why don't we take a shortcut over there?

He's already broken a boat like that.

Who broke the boat?

Another adventure without me, huh?

Julija, go through the channel.

The tide is low.
I told you to go through the stones.

Sit with me.

That's how I remember your father.

It's less than a meter to the left.

There's a big rock on the left! Go hit her!

There's a big rock on the left!
I don't need your help!

Who sank the boat?

Have nothing to say?

Remember, this is how we sailed in Kalaman?

I asked you something.
Leave her.

Before.
Leave her.

Next time, think twice
before saying something.

What are you doing?
She's the best swimmer.

Who is the best captain?

Are you okay?

I am well.

Javi, don't swim all!

I will anchor on the other side!

You know where I come from,

if a boy swims from one island
to another, he becomes a man.

Maybe we should try.

I don't like it when I don't
know what's beneath me.

If you need to know everything beforehand,
you will never leave this island.

I never said I wanted to go out.

So, you are good?

I'm diving tomorrow, deep, 40 meters.

There is a beautiful blue light.

Very pretty, but you can't
see it from the surface.

So, is that why you're here? By blue light?

You're out of shape, old man! She won you.

Well done, Julija!

Hey, this is the terrain. Comes.

How far is it from Italy?

That's the best part
of it all. Four o'clock.

And the Italian coast sucks.

This will be paradise for Italians.

Look this.
Look at him.

He needs it.

If he can do that, he'll be calmer.

If he makes money, it will get worse.

How are they friends?

They met when they were young.

People like Javi don't
have many friends like that.

We keep the other side of the
island in the open sea. Free for boats.

And Pavo is somewhere here, waiting for us.

Good, good, very good.

Hello? Where is he?

It's not today.

I told you five times!

What an idiot!

Cum!

I bring money to his door and he is late.

His bones turned to ash in seconds.

They were only a couple
of years older than me.

Pavo will be late.

It's useless to come home
when we've come this far.

Do not stress yourself.

I'm going to fish our dinner.

Julija, let's go!

I will stay.

In it, just loosen the rope and
attach the anchor if the wind changes.

Are you hungry? I can get some sea urchins.

Starving.

I'll get the knife and bread from the boat.

Mom, wait! I'll.

He likes you.

It's taking a while, where's Ante?

He must still be looking for a murine.

We can sail away, leave
him here, fishing for murine.

My mother got dressed for you last night.

She changed her clothes a few times.

Here it is.

I asked your mother to marry me.

What is...
When?

Aren't we going to tell the truth?
I won't comment on that.

Where are you going?
I will never go back

Nelita, come back here.
No!

Come here.
No, no.

Wait, wait there.

Look this.

Leave now, if you dare.

No, no, no...

Come on.
No.

Julija, your mother forgot how to dance.

Come on, mom.

Come, mother.

Dad is back.

In view of!

What was there?

I went to the other side and got stuck.

Fuck it, Javi. The big boat caught it all.

Little fishes.

Stop looking at him like
that. It looks like you're in love.

Pavo had to go to Split,
he'll meet us tomorrow.

Don't grab my foot.

It's my foot! Fight, Nela, fight!

Lute!

Fuck, Julija!

Let's go!

Team change!

Julija, are you ready?
I am.

Never give up! Never give up!

In it, you're letting them win!

That hurts!

Let me go! You will break my leg.

Javi, Javi.

Is that blood?

Hey.
I am fine.

Let me see.

This will stop the bleeding.
Thanks.

Perfect.

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

The eyes never lie.

I wasn't flirting.

In it, you showed him a necklace like this.

So?
I was 17.

Almost 18.
I remember that.

Turns out Nela showed
us her favourite jewellery.

Then I bought everything
she liked and gave it to her.

And then, I was fired.
That is what happened.

And then we all went sailing.

Good times.

It's not murine, but tomorrow
Julija will get you one.

Do you do spearfishing?

She loves it, she comes
with me every morning.

Huntress and beautiful, like her mother.

You can have anything
you want in life, Julija.

That's my girl.

I hate spearfishing.

I like to dive.

You like it when you
come home with a catch.

No, I like diving.

Once I was underwater for 5m 20s.

She won a medal in
the national competition.

Now I understand why
you want to sell your land.

Why?

If he sells the land, we
buy an apartment in Zagreb.

Which is! You must go to Harvard.

Harvard?
That.

Look at her, they would
do anything to have her.

She grew up in paradise.

Girls like her get pregnant soon,

and you know it as well as I do.

In view of...

Julija, help me with dessert.

I'd love to go.

That's great.

Don't destroy her dreams, Javi.
She is already larger than life.

Why not, I want to go.

Okay then go.

And do you think they are waiting for you?

They are not waiting for you.

There are millions like
you, millions better than you.

But she certainly will. We
sponsor your new library.

And that's good. But what
will you do with Harvard?

Come back here. Nobody here
cares about a Harvard degree.

Why would I need to go back?
Exactly.

Dreams die in paradise, Ante.

I know what's best for my daughter.

Like you know what's best for me, right?

Okay. Julija can go to Harvard,

but when she comes
back, she can run our resort.

She'll do a lot better than that.

Thanks.

Ante, you already ate one.

You'll love me anyway, no
matter how much I get fat.

Did you worry about me today?

Did you worry when I bled
in the water like an animal?

He leaves.

You went too far, as usual.

Julija, what happens when big
and small boats dock together?

The little boats save
people while the boats sink.

They hit.

Say good night and go to bed.

What are you doing?

Any.

Is that your mother's dress?

You have the shoulders of a man.

Where the fuck is she?

Try deeper.

I can be just like him.

I can send you to some
boarding school in the mountains.

Julija, money!

Really.

I forbid you to speak to him.
Pavo and the mayor are arriving.

I don't want to see your face!

Where's Javier?

They're coming.
Still sleeping.

It's already 10 am!

Lower!

What happened last night?

As well? Nothing happened.

Way!

Good Morning.

Good Morning.

Which boarding school
do your children attend?

Le Rosey.

Where it is?

In Switzerland.

It is good?

It's the best.

Why? Why ask?

They'll be here in an hour.

Do you know what this song is about?

Talks about falling in
love, as only 17 years do.

I never fell in love.

How could?

Go unlock the gate to Pavo.

That's... For Dubrovnik,
Zagreb... Can you tell me?

Dubrovnik is 4 hours away by speedboat

and Dubrovnik-Zagreb is 6.7 hours by car.

Any planes nearby?

Tax-free?

So tell me, how do you
intend to build this so remotely?

He has a plan.
That triples the cost, right?

Who do you have to build the pipeline?

Somebody?
Yes, we have a local company...

A local company?

It would be difficult to manage
this from another continent.

But we have everything
we need on this table.

I'll take care of it.

Did you tell him my
wife doesn't want to sell?

Hi girl.
Julija, we're working.

Julija, come here.

People burned to death.

This is a great
opportunity, now is the time.

What do you think?

It is complicated.

You can't build hotels there.

We'll build a memorial.
Just a second.

Leticia, please stop using
our children to your advantage.

That's what you and your lawyers are doing.

Stop making those excuses!

I don't tell you how to live!

You forget quickly.

I wrecked his boat to save his family.

I lost everything. Why don't
you remind Mare of that?

Seven boys went to fight the
fire on that useless piece of rock

and never came back.

So what to say they died for nothing?

We will make a monument for them!
The dead are dead.

It would have been better if
he had burned to death too.

We need to go with Javier.

He'll forget about us as
soon as he boards the plane.

Come on, help me.
This time is different.

Javier will leave tomorrow.

He's in love with you.

See how he looks at you?
He's kidding.

He's been doing this for years.
Is not true.

He needs you. Let's go with him.
And then?

Do you think we're going to
go around the world with him?

He has his own family.
You know that, right?

If I had your strength, I would use it.

So, good thing it doesn't.

I know what you want. I
saw you with him. Is obvious.

You deserve better.

What did you tell him?
That I'll take you tonight.

Javier!

By the way.

I'm going down!

What did I say about leaving your room?

Why did you let her out?

Did I let her out? What you want?

Lock us all in the house?

Maybe you don't respect me, but she will!

It's good of you to come back.

There's a mass in town and the
entire project team will be there.

Don't you really want to dive?

You live in paradise, Ante. I
should learn to appreciate it.

I'm going too.

Let's dress it up.

I see that everyone is brave today.

Fantastic! I'm very proud of you.

40 meters deep.

Well done, Julija!

Brave girl!

Crazy and brave.

You did very well.

I told you, she takes it literally.
I know that. I know.

Will you come next time?

How it was?
As if she was born in the sea.

Is mad at me?

I can't dive Just because you can't?

Leave me alone, Julija.

What did you want me to do?

It has nothing to do with you.
What does it have to do with?

What does it have to do with?

I got scared.

You're lying.
Didn't I ask you to leave me alone?

Leave me alone!

Are you jealous.

What's wrong with you, Julija?
There's nothing wrong with me.

You ruined your life and
now you want to ruin mine.

You play lovers behind daddy's back,

but you are a coward and
cannot have what you really want.

I'm leaving with him. I don't
care if you come with me!

Don't talk to your mother like that.

When he leaves, you will be
grounded. It won't go anywhere.

Understood?

Steam, Julija!

Turn off the engine!

Hi, want a drink?

Would you like?

You live there, right?

Do not.

Wasn't your father
yelling at us the other day?

No, my father is a millionaire.

We're going around the
world before I go to Harvard.

Legal.

So, are you here to swim
and visit the fisherman?

He's in love with his wife.
That's why we're here.

Are you having an affair?

I'm running.

Is it Harvard?

Want to come with us?
Julija!

Julija, let's go! I know!

I will never go back.

Come on... We have a party to go to.

It does not matter. I
can do whatever I want.

For sure.

Boys! I'll give this watch to the first one
who pulls my daughter out of the water!

We will.
Do you want this watch?

You better be quick!

Want to come?

Sorry guys! Very slowly.

You are dangerous.

What was it?

You leave tomorrow.

Javi, come get dressed,
we're going to be late!

You became important overnight, didn't you?

Where are you going?

Do you think you're smart?
Let me go.

Do you think you're smart?

What did you talk about?
Nothing.

What?

For thirteen years I worked for this man.

Then one wrong act and he kicked us out.

Me, you and your mother!
He didn't give a damn!

Who do you think he is?
Do you think he's your friend?

He's not here to buy your land.

You will never go to Harvard!

You will never go anywhere!

Want to behave like an
animal? You'll be stuck like one!

Let me go!

You'll be alone in this house Like a dog!

You will spend ten years in this hole.

Goes into!
You will stay here alone!

Open the door!

Open!

Here, eat something.

You can take this with you.

You provoked him.

Do you know what will happen?
You did this to us.

on it! We will.

We could have had a
normal life, but you chose this.

It's my fault?

One day, you'll realize what I do for you.

What did you do?

To be the island's miss beauty?

In it, what did I say?

Mom!

Mom!

Dad!

I hate you!

Go! Hit me in front of everyone.

Hit me in front of everyone.

Mom hates you! Everyone hates you!

People burned to death on
the land he's trying to sell you.

Calm down, Ante, calm down.

He lied to you!

Before, calm down.

Do not touch me!

Why the fuck are you here? To
eat my wife and raise my daughter?

You primitive idiot. If
you hurt them, I'll kill you!

You coward!

Coward!

You are no longer my
daughter. I disown you!

Do not touch me!

On it, come here!

Please take me here. I
can't take this place anymore.

Take me with you to Switzerland.
Julija, I can't take you with me.

Please.

In it, I can book a room
for you in Dubrovnik.

Give him a few days to calm down.

Javi, it's time for you to leave.

Julija, let's go home.
Do not touch me.

I'm ready.

Julija.

I'm ready.

You are strong.

Please Javier...

You have to take me with
you. I can't stay in this house.

I am really sorry.

It was all a lie. You lied to me.

Nobody loves Me?

And who loves you?

Remember that when you
think about how bad I am.
