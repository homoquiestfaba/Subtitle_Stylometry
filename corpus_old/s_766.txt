I'm not going to
unbuckle your pants yet.

Let's get you in.

Miss Mary Ann Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.

Wait till you see what I got
in the goodie bag.

Goodie bag?

Gonna fly you to
the moon, baby.

Let me get
your hand, Ray.

There go three.
That's for you.

I thought you was
my friend, Fathead.

The weight is off.

Don't start with me, Ray.

The weight is off.

It ain't off.

When you get high, man,
and you try to cop,

those dealers spank your ass.

You gotta have
more discipline.

You know what, man?
I ain't messing up
my high tonight,

sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

Look, Fathead,
just tie me off.

Come on, Fathead. Fat.

Take care of
your bad self,
you know so damn much.

Later, Margie.

Bye, Fathead.

Damn.

Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

Hey, Margie.

Yeah?
What do you want?

Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and... and pick that up for me.

You're going to
have to get me off.

I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

Shit. No, honey.

This ain't for
no little girls.

I ain't no little girl!

I understand.
It's just that this stuff

will take you places
that you don't want to go.

See, I want to share
that with you.

Listen to me!

If I ever hear about you
doing some drugs

you're through, you hear me?

You believe that
more than you
believe in Jesus!

Don't say that,
Ray.

Ray!

Ray, I watch your show
every single night.

And every night
is new to me.

Maybe because
it's new to you.

It's like you live
every single word

and then you
bend some crazy note,

And damn if you
don't break my heart.

You got genius, baby.

I just want to
be a part of that.

Just want to be
a part of that.

# You know the night time,
darling #

# Night and day #

# Is the right time #

# Night and day #

# To be #

# Night and day #

# With the one you love, now #

# Night and day #

# Say now oh baby #

# Night and day #

# When I come home baby, now #

# Night and day #

# I want you to hold my hand #

# Night and day #

# Yeah, tight as you can #

# Night and day #

# I know the night time #

# Night and day #

# Whoa, is the right time #

# Night and day #

# To be with the one
you love, now #

# Night and day #

# You know what
I'm thinking of #

# Night and day #

# Whoa!
Sing your song, Margie #

# Night and day #

# Baby #

# Night and day #

# Baby #

# Night and day #

# Oh, baby #

# Night and day #

# Do I love you? #

# Night and day #

# No one above you #

# Night and day #

# Hold me tight #

Look at him.
Look at his
knees shaking.

He's got that
junkie itch.

# Because the night time #

He's totally hooked.

# Oh, is the right time #

Yeah, but listen
to that sound.
He's brilliant.

You can never trust
a junkie, man.

What do you want me to do?
Listen to him, man.

# I said baby #

# Night and day #

# Baby #

# Night and day #

# Baby #

# Night and day #

# Oh, baby #

# Night and day #

Happy birthday!

Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Ray!

You know what to do.

Take a deep breath.
Go ahead.

He blow them out?

Every single one.

# I know the night time #

# Night and day #

# Everyday is the right time #

# Night and day #

# Night and day #

# You know #

# Night and day #

You know what,
I... I just want to
thank you so very much.

Please, uh,
another round of applause
for Miss Margie Hendricks.

Thank you so much,
and good night.

Hey, you see
what time it is?

What's the problem?

The problem is
on the contract.
That's the problem.

Ray! Ray! You still
got 20 minutes left.

Okay, what you want to do?

That fool's holding us
to every second
of the contract.

Go... go baby-sit him.
I'll take care of it.

It's okay.

You know what, they say
we got a little bit
more work to do.

That was the last song
in the book, Ray.

You know, Fathead,
it ain't never the last song.

Now, band, follow me
and do what I do,
say what I say.

This is how we gonna do it.

# Hey mama,
don't you treat me wrong #

# Come and love your daddy
all night long #

# It's all right #

# Whoa, it's all right #

# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

# See the girl
with the diamond ring #

# She knows how to
shake that thing #

# Whoa, it's all right #

# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

That's what I'm talking about.

# Tell your mama,
tell your pa #

# I'm gonna send you back
to Arkansas #

# Oh yes, ma'am,
you don't do right #

# Don't do right #

# What'd I say? #

# Tell me what'd I say #

# Tell me what'd I say #

Where can I get
that record from?

I don't know.
It doesn't exist yet.

I'll tell Ray
he should record it.

# Oh, no #

# Mmm #

# Mmm #

# Ooh #

# Ooh #

# Eee #
# Eee #

# Ooh #
# Ooh #

# It's all right #

# Baby, it's all right #

# Baby, it's all right #

# Oh, it's all right #
# Baby, it's all right #

# Mama, it's all right #

# Baby, it's all right #

# It's all right #

# It's all right #

# It's all right, now #

Yeah, that's it.

Oh, this is it.

I'm telling you,
that is out of sight.
That's a hit.

It's fantastic, Ray.
But what the hell are we
gonna do with this?

It's too damn long.

Every night we play this, man,
we bring the house down.

I'm telling you,
it's guaranteed.

Tom, cut the playback!

Come on out here.

# Baby, it's all right #

You know what, Ray,
you're probably right.

I mean,
I'm sure you're right.

I've never heard
a sound like this before.

But how the hell are
we gonna market this?

We could cut the second verse,
pop back into the chorus.

Man, you cut that,
I'll cut you in half.

All right, all right,
Ray. Ahem.

We could, uh,
split it up.

Do a Side AISide B
type of thing.

It's been done before.
What the hell, right?

Yeah.

It's s-sexual.

It's just too
damn sexual for kids.

Let's do it.

Yeah, baby!
That's why
I love y'all, man.

All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

Atlantic!

We'll release it
in the summer.

There's less censorship,
school's out.

The kids are ready
to kick loose.

Ha, okay!

Tom, let's see
if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

Show me what your
genius is all about.

You got it, boss.

Yeah, that is it.
You put one on Side A,
put another on Side B.

Man, that sounds
out of sight.

How you feeling, Ray?

I feel groovy, baby.

I'm talking about the junk.
What?

It's starting
to show.

You're scratching
all the time.

You can't sit still.

Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

No, you never have.

Who's the one
who delivers a record
in one take, hmm?

Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know

but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

Now come on,
listen to me.

I'm worried about you.

As a friend,
I'm telling you, man,
your slip is hanging.

"Your slip is hanging."

You been hanging out
with us country boys
too much, man.

Uh, don't worry about this,
man. If this monkey gets
too heavy on my back,

I'll get an organ grinder,
man, and put him to work.

# One more time #

# One more time #

He's off the Chitlin' Circuit.

Down Beat voted him
Best Male Jazz Vocalist
by a 2-to-1 margin.

Well, if you want to keep him
in Philadelphia,

you're going to find him
a bigger venue.

# Make me feel so good #

# Make me feel so good #

# Make me feel so good #

# Make me feel so good, yeah #

# Make me feel so good, yeah #

Terrific.

# Make me feel so fine #

# Make me feel so fine #

# Make me feel so fine #

# Make me feel so fine #

# Baby, it's all right #

# Baby, it's all right #

Ray, I'm... I'm having
second thoughts about this.

I don't... I don't know
nobody in I.A.

Bea, I don't want my kids
growing up in the South.

Now, I.A. Is where,
you know, a Negro can
spread his wings and fly.

Ray, my whole family's
in Texas.

That's why
we're moving to I.A.

Tell you what, Jeff,
tell the boys
they can go ahead

and start their
vacation right now.

All right, boss.
Once I get you inside.

# Make me feel all right #

Look at that
huge coconut tree!

That ain't
no coconut tree, Della.
That's a palm tree.

There's thousands
of them.

Okay.

Here's the keys
to your life,
a brand-new life.

Oh, Ray.

Ray, this is too much.

Have you seen
the dining room?

But, baby,
it's October.

But you know what,
I wanted to
celebrate early,

because the band
is gonna be playing
during the holidays.

You are unbelievable.

Look at your presents.

Baby, look at what
Santa brought you.

You must have been good.

Go ahead!
Christmas is early,
baby!

Go get it.

What's he taken?
A guitar.

A musician just
like your daddy.

Can you play?

Hello?

What else you got?

What's that?

How'd you get this number?

How do you think I got it?

Put Ray on the phone.

Ray, telephone.

Deal with it, man.

Ray, it's important.
Telephone.

I-I'll be right back.

All right.

Who is it?

It's Margie, man.

Junior, come... come
and help your mama
change your brother's diaper.

I don't want to go.

I want to stay and
open my presents.

All right, come on!
I don't want to go.

I don't care.
Don't let me tell you twice.

Hello.
Hey, baby.

Surprise! I came to I.A.
To surprise you.

Surprise me?
Are you out of your mind?

I'm with my wife
and my kids.

Well, on the road,
I'm Mrs. Ray Charles.

That's on the road.

Yeah, but, baby, come on,
I got everything
set up for us.

Did you hear what
I just said to you, huh?

Oh, wait a minute,
baby, look,
I got a bottle of Bols, and...

Shut up. Shut up.
Listen, we record in
two weeks, okay?

I'll see you then.

Wait a minute, Ray!
Bye.

Ray!

# One of these days,
and it won't be long #

# You're gonna look for me #

# and I'll be gone #

# 'Cause I believe #

# I believe, yes #

# I say I believe right now #

# I believe #

# Yes I believe #

# Well I believe
to my soul now #

# You're tryin' to make
a fool of me #

# I believe, yes I believe #

Hold on, wait, wait.

Cut, cut, cut.
You know, y'all know
that sounds off.

Ahem, you know what,
the three-part harmony is off.

Let's start it
all over again, uh,
from the top with the band.

# I believe it,
I believe it #

Whoa, pardner!
Uh, what was that?

I knew you'd like that,
Ray. It's an eight-track.
We just got it.

We can record
each part separately.

Whoa, Nellie! You know,
I can't wait to see that.

What's so funny?

Nothing, "pardner."

Margie's drunk. Jeff?

You should go home
and sleep it off.

Margie, come on now,
let me take you home.

No! I'll leave when I'm good
and goddamn ready!

She's good and goddamn
ready right now.

Why don't you make me
leave this, sucker!

Teach you to treat me
like some piece of meat!

I ain't shutting up!

Should we get in there?
No.

Get them all out, right now.

You'll have to make me leave!

You know what, Jeff?
Get all of them out of here.

You're a cold-ass bastard!

Let go of me, Jeff!

You're a cold-ass bastard,
Ray!

See, he wouldn't spit on me
if my ass was on fire!

Damn right I wouldn't.

Put me down, Jeff!
Put me down! Damn it!

You dropped your shoe.

All right, come on,
let's get back to work.

Tom, this is
what I want you to do.

We'll lay my vocals down
and finish the harmony parts.

Uh, how're we gonna do
the harmonies, Ray?

You sent the girls home.

I know what I did
with the girls.
Let me take care of that.

You just turn that
eight-track on, and I'll do
the girls' parts myself.

And go out here
somewhere and find me
an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

Uh, one minute.

What the hell's
an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

I think I've got an idea.

# Last night
you were dreaming #

# and I heard you say #

# Oh, Johnny! #

# When you know
my name is Ray #

# That's why
I believe right now #

# I believe #

# Yes I believe #

# I say I believe right now #

# I believe #

# Yes I believe #

The sky's the limit, Ray.

I got you
a $5,000-a-night raise.

They're gonna up you
to 15 per.

Rehearsal in
10 minutes.

Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

Okay, boss.

15 per, huh?

You know, Ray,
your contract with Atlantic
is expiring in four months.

Yeah.

Yeah, I've got
the contract with me.

They're going to
double my royalties.

Before we jump back
in that pond,

I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

ABC? Who told you
to do that, huh?

And you know,
Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

ABC is very interested.

No.

How interested?

How about
a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

You produce
your own records.

They'll deduct recording costs
and give you

75 percent.

Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

so will you put them off
until I can talk
things out with ABC?

Well, my mama said,
ain't nothing wrong
with talking.

Hey, enough of
the formalities.

Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

I hope I can call you Ray.

I want you to be
comfortable here.

Because I'll tell you
something, everything is
gonna be better at ABC.

Moving from an indie label
to a major

means you can sell
a lot more records,

as well as attract
much larger crowds,
both white and Negro.

Yeah, but Mr. Clark,
you know, I've been
at Atlantic for so long,

I just want to give
those guys a chance, you know,
to at least match the offer.

Mm-hmm.
Oh, certainly, certainly.

But, uh, I doubt
they'll be able to.

We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

Well, you know, since I'm
producing my own records,
I was wondering if I could

uh, own my masters, too.

Well,

Ray, we've... we've never
done that before.

No record company has.

Well, I think I'm going to
have to have it that way for
me to leave Atlantic Records.

Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

Obviously, you don't!

Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

You know what he said, Ray?

He said you would never
turn your back on us.

Never for a schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

who wouldn't know
the difference between
Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

We let you grow here, Ray.

And nobody's taking
credit for your talent,
but we nourished it.

We let you do your thing.

God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

You know what,
don't think that
I don't appreciate

everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

Ahmet, I'm very
proud of the work that
we've done here together.

But, Atlantic has done
pretty good money-wise
on my records, haven't they?

Yes, we've done
very well, Ray.

You... you were the ones that
taught me that making a record
is business,

and find the best
business deal you can.

Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters

is a pretty damn
good deal.

Can you match it?

Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

I'm very proud of you.

Looks like those boys
are going to get
a taste of country dumb.

Yeah.

He'll be all right, man.

You guys
always do find the best.

# Georgia #

# Georgia #

# The whole day through #

# The whole day through #

# Just an old sweet song #

# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

# Georgia on my mind #

# I said Georgia #

# Georgia #

Listen to that crap.

Thought you said that
ABC wasn't going to
force nothing on him.

They didn't.

It was Ray's idea.

Something new.

What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

Yeah, what about us?
We got to eat, too.

# Other arms should
reach out to me #

# Other eyes smile tenderly #

# Still in the peaceful dreams
I see #

# The road leads back
to you #

It's a hit record.

What the hell
is wrong with that?

Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

The blind Liberace,
leaving those Rocking
Chair roots behind.

Quincy Jones.

Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

Six-nine!
Hey, boy.

Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

I'd love to
get you two together, man.

S-some other time.

Look at you.
How's it going, man?
You look good.

Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

You hear what they're
saying about me?

I just said that I... I
can't do it no more.
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

So crank out
another hit.

Let me tell you something,

it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

Where you blow in from?

Paris.

Bonjour.

Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

man, it's just...
it really feels out of sight.

You know, we gotta
record something together.

I mean, people will
really dig it.

So, where you going
after the Festival?

Oh, I... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

You know what, once you
get the record out there,
you gotta sell it.

The South, man?

I'm not doing that no more.

Hey, come on, kid,
that's where
the money is, baby.

You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

we went down there, man.

And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

Even if he's 80 years old.

I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

If that's what you feel, baby.

I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

Well, you know,
what... what the hell, man.

You're just going
to leave a lot more money
on the table for me.

You're welcome to it,
man.

You ready to work?

Work on what?

Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

Percy just sent me
some new music.

You know what
they're saying about me?

Said I've lost something,
said I've gone
middle-of-the-road.

They may as well say
the same thing about you.

You were the soul
of this band.

Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

Drunk soul
of a blind junkie.

What a lovely couple.

Why don't you
just get out of here?

I ain't drunk, Ray.

I'm pregnant.

Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

You ain't really...
You... you can't do that.

I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

You gotta get rid of it.

My God!

What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

You lay up
in my bed every night.

My bed!

I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

No, Ray! No!
Come on, come on.
Come on, just listen.

Just listen to me.

You know
I care about you, baby.

I won't let
nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

No!

It's gonna cost you
more than money.

I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

You out of your damn mind.
You knew the rules
when you got into this.

You know goddamn well
I ain't gonna
leave my family.

Leave your family?

You are a damn fool,
you know that?

Between the dope
and the music and me,

you already done left
your damn family!

You know what
the sad part about it is,
Ray, you don't even know it.

You know what?

From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

Can you hear me? It's Sam!

Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

Hey, you feeling all right?

Well, come on, baby,
be happy.
You're doing good.

Thank you, Sam.

I really am happy about that.

Yeah.

I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money
on my way out.

Ray.

Margie, you ain't gotta leave,
baby.

I'm on your hit record.

If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

Yeah, I... I don't want you...

I don't want you to go solo.

Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

You remember the hummingbird,
right?

What?

The hummingbird, Bea.

And I don't want you to go.

Somebody will fetch you

when your bus
gets to St. Augustine.

And when you get there,
show them this sign,

and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

And them sandwiches I made,
don't eat 'em all at once.
You hear?

Oh, please,
don't make me go away.

I'll keep up
with the normal kids.

I'll be good,
just like George.

This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

Them teachers
at that blind school, they can
teach you things I can't.

And you need an education
in this world.

I don't want
no education!

Don't say that!

I don't!
I want to stay with you!

Stop it, Ray!

I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me,
you hear?

Now listen, if you
want to do something
to make your mama proud,

promise me, promise me
you'll never let nobody
turn you into no cripple.

You won't become
no charity case.

You'll stand on
your own two feet.

I promise.

I love you, baby.

I'm so proud of you.

Get out of here!

Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

We got refreshments
waiting.

Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

You know tonight's show
is segregated?

The dance floor
is whites only.

Negroes can't leave
the balcony.

That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

You think we don't know that?

Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

Ain't nothing
I can do about that.

I'm an entertainer.
And... and we all gotta
play Jim Crow down here.

I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

It doesn't have to
be that way.

You could change things,
right here and now!

I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

Now get your black ass
out of here, and take
that trash with you!

Hold on... hold on.
He... he's right.
He's right, Jeff.

Get them on the bus.

You sure?

Get them back on the bus!

Y'all heard him!
Y'all heard Ray!

Back on the bus!

Are you serious?

Get them on the bus.

I can't do nothing here.

Ray, you know me.

I'm not gonna lose money
just because you suddenly
got religion.

Ain't nothing I can do, man.

We have a contract with me.
You break it,
I'll sue your ass!

I'll win, Ray!
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

Look, I'll win big!

Do what you gotta do.

I told you,
I'll own your ass, Ray!

Thank you, Mr. Charles.

You could be the first.

No, thank you, son.
You were right.

You're right.

You'll never
work Georgia again!

He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

This guy's got juice.
He can get you barred from
ever playing Georgia again.

But he's willing to drop
the suit if you'll
make up the gig.

Not if it's segregated.

Ray,

I admire
what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

I'm not playing any more
to Jim Crow joints ever again,
did you got that?

Yeah. I got it.

Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

Com on, y'all, let's go.

Let's dance, everybody!

Come on!

Let's dance now!

Charles, you okay?

Yeah. What's going on?

Just kids onstage dancing.

Well, let them dance.
That's what they're here for.

Please don't hurt them!
Just keep dancing!

Keep going!
Keep going!

Mr. Charles,
it's Western Union!

We have a telegram
for you.

You have to sign
for it, sir.

I'm coming.

Indianapolis police.
Got a report of loud music
coming from here.

Where do you think
you're going, pal?

I'm just going
to the bathroom.

Handcuff
this son of a bitch.

Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

It ain't like
I'm dealing it, man.

I'm not hurting nobody.

Oh, no, you're
hurting everybody.

Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

You have to understand.
I got... I got a wife,
I got kids.

I got responsibilities.

Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

Bring them in!

Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

How long you
been on heroin?

Come on, Ray.

What did they
charge you with?

# You give your hand to me #

# And then you say, hello #

# And I can hardly speak #

# My heart is beating so #

# And anyone can tell #

# You think you know me well #

# But you,
you don't know me at all #

Hi, baby.

David.

Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

No. Baby, come on.

Bea?
What?

You know, since I got back...

Since you got out.

Yeah.

Well, since I got here,
you haven't said more than
two words to me.

Ray, what am I
supposed to say?

My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

Maybe they never did.

Come on, Bea,
you... you know I love you.

Are you gonna stop then?

You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is

there's a lot of
mean-spirited people
out there.

Yeah.

Ray?

You know, I had to
bring Junior home
from school today

'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

They got mean-ass kids
around here.

I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

'Cause it... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

And those boys worship you.

You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

Bea, that's not fair.

What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

That... that's a low blow.

Hello?

Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

Really?

Ah, good, good, good.
Tell... tell Sam
I said thank you.

All right.
All right, then.

Oh, yeah!

What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

Ray, tell me what happened.

ABC got the case dropped.

The police
didn't have a warrant.

They bought them off.

Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

and they are making that
completely impossible.

You know what,
you don't understand.

Then make me understand,
Ray!

Baby, when I walk out
that door, I walk out alone
in the dark!

I'm trying to
do something

that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

But I can't do it
if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

I don't want to
be alone here, Bea.

Not in my own home.

Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

then who will?

I don't know, Ray.

David? I'm coming!

Mama's coming!

Ray, we pull you
out of the fire,
and you want country music?

Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

As a matter of fact,
I used to play with
the Florida Playboys.

We made a big
investment in you

and it's paying off
handsomely.

For both of us,
I might add.

We don't want to
lose your fan base.

Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

but I actually think that
we have more to gain
than we do to lose.

Ray, it's a bad idea.

When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract

that I can choose
my own music.

You want to read
that paragraph?

It's on page three.

I don't need to see it.

Good evening, Saint Louis.

It's time
for the main attraction.

The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

Ray Charles!

Go on, go on, Ray!

Thank you so much.

You know what,
I know that a lot of y'all
don't know that

I... I was brought up
in the South.

You know, every time
you turn on the radio there
in the South,

you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

I... I want to sing something
to give you a taste
of my country roots.

Unchain My Heart!

Georgia on My Mind, Ray!

# I can't stop loving you #

Turn 'em, the lights up top
and on the mezzanine,

let's take everything down
and hit Ray
with a follow spot.

We're doing it,
on it on my count.

# To live in memory #

IN 5, 4...

# of the lonesome times #

# Yeah #

# I can't stop wanting you #

# It's useless to say #

# So I'll just live my life #

# I'll live my life #

# in dreams of yesterday #

# Those happy hours #

# Those happy hours #

# that we once knew #

Cab's here.

Okay.

Dad, if you can't see,
how can you choose
the right color socks?

I'm... I'm gonna show you,
all right?

Let me show you something.

See? Right here?

The two, right there,
I got it sewn in thick,
so I can feel it.

So, it means two is brown.

One is black. Three is blue.

And... and... and where's four?

Nowhere.

Four ain't nowhere.
There ain't no four.
You're right.

# Heals a broken heart #

# But time has stood still #

# Time has stood still #

# Since we've been apart #

# Since we've been apart #

Still working on the balcony.

Okay, guys, we got
10 minutes to load out!

Change back at the hotel.

They bought that
country jive hook,
line and sinker.

Ray, man,
you're amazing.

I'm gonna tell you something.
Country music.
You know why they like it?

The stories, man.
They got great stories.

Hey, Joe.

Ray, I want to introduce you
to Joe Adams.
Hal Ziegler hired Joe

as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

I know you,
Mayor of Melody.

I used to listen to your
radio show in I.A.
In the '50s.

We've both come
a ways since then.

What was that counting
you were doing back there?

I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience

so you can sing your ballad
instead of
having to scream it.

Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

No one.
It just needed to be done.

See, that's what
I'm talking about.

I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done"

as opposed to
a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

I know you know
Jack Lauderdale.

Hello, New York!

Hello, Boston!

Hello, Saint Louis!

Good evening, San Francisco!

# Bye bye love #

# Bye bye happiness #

Ray, I got
some good news for you.

We got the cover of Cash Box.

"The nation's hottest album:
Modern Sounds of
Country & Western."

You are hotter
than hell.

That's what they say.

I've been watchin',
your albums are
going through the roof,

your concerts are
always selling out.

You'll need shelters
for your money.

You're in a
new tax bracket.

Keep your drawers on, Fathead!
I got the instruments!

Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.

Who was
the director again?

Otto Preminger.

He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

She was the star.
I was supporting.

Is that a fact?

Prepare for an extraordinary
evening of music.

Perhaps the most innovative,
unique

and energetic
musical voice today.

Please welcome
to the stage...

It is my distinct pleasure...

Please give
your warmest welcome,
the one-of-a-kind...

I present Mr. Ray...

Ray... Ray Charles!

# Bye bye love #

# Bye bye sweet caress #

# Hello emptiness #

# I think I'm gonna die #

# Bye bye love #

# I think I'm gonna die #

# I think I'm gonna die #

...Ray Charles!

# I think I'm gonna die #

# I think I'm gonna die #

Bea, there's a park right
at the end of the street.

You can see the whole I.A.
Basin from there.

Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

How does it look, Bea, huh?
You like it, don't you?

I don't know.
I haven't seen it.

You got to like it.

Voilà.

This foyer is designed
to impress anybody
who walks through the door.

It has a big
winding staircase,
just like Gone With the Wind.

We should get
our portraits painted,
like Rhett and Scarlett.

Bea, bring him in here.

Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting
in the living room.

What is it?

I had them build you
a solid marble fireplace,
two stories high.

Hot damn!
How do you like it, Bea?

It's awful big.

It sure is:
8,500 square feet.

Biggest house in
the neighborhood.

So, does this meet
with your approval?

Man, this is a palace.

You think this is big?
Wait until tomorrow
when you see

30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

Yeah, headquarters!

This is it, Ray. Your
brand-new recording studio.

Did you get
everything I asked for?

Totally state-of-the-art.

Tom Dowd built
an eight-track mixing console,
two recorders, the works.

Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

Got your own private bathroom
to your left.

Right behind you
is my adjoining office.

And step over
to your private bar
to your left.

Got a bottle of Bols
right in the center.

You know me pretty good.

If you run out, shout,
I'm right next door.

This is nice, right here.

It's the house
that Ray built.

Yes, it is.

# Born to lose #

# I've lived my life
in vain #

Ray Junior, slow down!

This ain't no
baseball diamond!

Charles residence.

Mr. Charles?

Hey, girl,
Bring that boy over here!

I got a hot dog
with his name on it!
Come on, now.

Hello.

Uh, yes,
I know who you are.

What? Oh, God, no.

Ray.

Yes, I'll get on a plane
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

What happened?

Margie's dead.

Oh, God! H-How?

She overdosed.

I didn't start her, Bea.

I didn't let her
do dope around me.

I... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set
a fine example.

What about her baby?

You knew?

His name is Charles Wayne.

He was born October 1,
in New York City.
He's 3 years old.

The baby's fine.

He's at her sister's.

All right.
I'll start sending them
some money.

You don't have to.
I send them
money every month.

In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

and he'll be ready to go.

Now the charts
Jeff is handing out

should be turned in
at the conclusion of...

You're late,
that's a $50 fine.

I ain't late.

I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

2:05. He's late.
He'll be charged $50.

What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

I'll talk to whoever
I damn well please,
and it sure as hell ain't you.

Jive jerk.

Hey, Ray,

this fool Joe Adams
is trying to fine me
for being late.

What time did you get here?

What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

Jeff don't...
Look, I'm not Jeff.

That's a fact, Jack!

Ray, you said
the band was my thing.

It is.

Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

Ray.

Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

Fathead, go on now.

You want to tell me
what the hell
is going on, Ray?

I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

Ray's running a business.

He shouldn't
have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

I'm not talking
to you, Joe.

I'm talking to Ray.

Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

But If you come in here
with this, uh,
"running a business" crap,

you're gonna lose
some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

There are musicians
waiting in line
to play with Ray Charles.

Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

It ain't like the days
when it was seven of us
on the Chitlin' Circuit.

I mean, if you weren't busy
building a bowling alley,
you'd seen that.

So you know about that, huh?

I know about everything.

I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

If the Shaw Agency is gonna
give you a cut of
the 10 percent I'm given them.

I might as well keep
the goddamn money
in my pocket.

Leave us alone.
We need to talk.

Ray.

You can step outside, Joe.

I'll be in my office.

Ray, now I know
that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

But I have never stolen
from you, Ray,
and I never will.

I got a small business loan,
and, yeah, Milt Shaw
was giving me a little extra,

but I'm not a thief, Ray.

Then what about that,
Jeff, huh?

A promoter swearing you did
side deals with him so
you could split my overages!

How could you do that to me?

We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

You know what, Ray?

If we were like brothers,

why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

Well, you know what, Ray?
You broke mine
a long goddamn time ago!

Well, then there it is.

You know something, Ray?

You're going to get yours
one day.

And I pray to God that he
has mercy on your soul,
you son of a bitch!

Everything all right, Ray?

How the hell
do you think it is?

Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

Oh, that's great.

Oh, damn!
I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

Tell the coach
I don't care
how much they cost.

Okay.

All right, son,
you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

The plane to Montreal
leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

All right.

Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

Yeah.

Do you know how much
making the all-star team
means to him?

I know.
I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

What?

He was stealing.

Jeff?
Hmm.

I don't believe it.

Yeah, well,
we're better without him.

# My mother told me #

# 'Fore she passed away #

# Said son when I'm gone #

# Don't forget to pray #

# 'Cause there'll be
hard times #

# Hard times #

# Oh, yeah, yeah #

# Who knows better than I #

Excuse me!
Get 'em out!

U.S. Customs!

We're goanna need
to see some identification,
please.

You just arrived
from Montreal?

Yes. Is there a problem?

We were alerted
there might be drugs
on this plane.

What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

Now, we're going
to have to search
everyone on this plane.

Mr. Charles,
if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

I'd like to see your overcoat.

I don't mind.

Don't say anything, Ray.

What's this?

Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

It's federal.
They can charge you
of smuggling

which can mean
real prison time.

Our lawyers will do
what they can, but...

Hello.

You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

No, it's my house.

You ain't been here
more than six days
since we moved in.

No, Ray, no! A needle
ain't gonna solve this!

Get out of the way.
Move!

Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

Don't think of God?
Do you have any idea
how it feels to go blind

and still be afraid
of the dark?

And every day, you stand pray
for just a little light,
and you get nothing.

'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

Stop talking like that.

As far as I'm concerned,
me and God is even
and I do what I please.

If goddamn it,
if I want to shoot up,
I shoot up.

Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door

and I'm doing something
I should have done
a long time ago.

I'm taking my boys
and I'll leave.

You're not going away.
You... you have no place to go.

No place?
No.

You think I'm
scared of losing this?

Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing
was you.

Because where was
I ever gonna find
another Ray Robinson?

So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

Maybe that makes me
part to blame.

But I ain't scared
no more.

You know I love you
and those boys
more than anything.

That is a damn lie
and you know it!

You ever look at this?

Really look at it, Ray!

Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

He was so proud this day,

until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

No! No! There is something
you love more than
me and them boys,

more than all the women
you ever slept with
on the road,

more than all
the dope you ever took.

What are you talking about?
Your music.

And if you don't stop
using that needle,

they're gonna
take away your music
and put you in jail.

Is that poison
worth losing everything?

Mr. Charles?

Mr. Charles.

You don't have to
go through this.

We have a substitute
that can help
wean you off heroin.

I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

Ah. Don't touch me.

All right.

We'll do it your way.

Doctor?

Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

He's got no fluids left.

Get an I.V.
In him right away.

I'll insert the needle.
No needles.

Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

Runner, I've got a runner!

Whoa.

Let me go. Let me go.
Get him on the bed.

Put those restraints on him.

No needles.

No, no.

Oh.

George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

I miss you.

Oh.

Okay. Uh-oh.

You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

I-I'll tell you what,
I won't lose again
the same way twice.

I spoke with
the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

Oh, that's great.

But you must
complete our program

and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe

I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

Who's George?

Ray,

you've come through
the worst of
the physical reactions.

We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

I can handle this.

Mr. Charles,

you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

Junkie? What...

Nobody cons me
at any price.

I'm not trying
to do that.

If you want me
to give that judge
a positive report,

you will have to earn it.

Doc?

Dr. Hacker?

Doc?

Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

He ain't there.

Talk to me, son.

I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

Mama, I kept my promise.

You got strong all right.

Went places
I never dreamed of.

But you still
became a cripple.

Come here, baby.
Come here.

Ray?

It wasn't your fault.

Now promise us

you'll never let
nobody or nothing

turn you into
no cripple ever again.

That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

Promise.

Today we're here
to right a wrong

that was done to one
of our native sons
nearly 20 years ago.

In 1961,

Ray Charles was banned
from performing
in the state of Georgia

because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

Some of us have fought
for equality through
the political process,

but Ray Charles
changed American culture
by touching people's hearts.

So on this day,
March 7, 1979,

we, the duly
elected representatives
of the state of Georgia

not only proclaim
Georgia on My Mind
our official state song,

we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology

and welcome him back home.

# Every time
I sing this song #

If only your mama was here.

She's here.

She ain't never left.

# I sing for #

# Georgia #

# Whoa, Georgia #

# The whole day through #

# Just this old, sweet song #

# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

# Georgia #

# Oh, yeah #

# Yeah, Georgia #

# A song of you #

# Comes as sweet and clear #

# as moonlight
through the pines #

# I feel that #

# Other arms #

# reach out to me #

# Other eyes #

# smile #

# tenderly #

# Well, all right now #

# Yeah #

# Don't you know? #

# Still in peaceful dreams #

# I see a busy road #

# The road leads back to you #

# Oh, Georgia #

# No peace I find #

# Please stop by #

# Don't you hear me now? #

# Just this old, sweet song #

# I say, oh, I say #

# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

# On my mind #

# On my mind #

# Yeah #

# Keeps Georgia #

# On my mind #

# You know that the little
girls are on my mind, huh? #

# Yes, it did, now, yeah #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Baby, let me be #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# 'Cause you don't
care about me #

# Unchain my heart #

# You've got me sewed up
like a pillow case #

# But you let my love
go to waste #

# So unchain my heart,
oh please,
please set me free #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Baby, let me go #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# 'cause you don't love me
no more #

# Unchain my heart #

# Every time I call you
on the phone #

# Some fella tells me that
you're not at home #

# So unchain my heart,
oh please,
please set me free #

# I'm under your spell #

# I'm under your spell #

# Like a man in a trance #

# Like a man in a trance #

# But I know darn well #

# I know darn well #

# that I don't
stand a chance #

# I don't stand a chance #

# So, unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Let me go my way #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# Unchain my heart #

# You worry me night and day #

# Unchain my heart #

# Why lead me
through a life of misery #

# When you don't care
a bag of beans for me #

# So unchain my heart,
please, please set me free #

# Please set me free #

# Oh, won't you set me free #

# Please set me free #

# Whoa, set me free #

# Please set me free #

# Wow, set me free #
