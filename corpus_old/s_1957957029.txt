[Wind whistling]

[Engine whirring]

[Engine starts]

[Drill instructor] Move!
[Soldier] Thank you, sir.

[Mechanic 1]
It could be tough to replace.

[Mechanic 2] Yeah, go and jet
the vent tube.


[Soldier, muffled]
You ain'â€™t worth shit.

Yeah, I'â€™m talking to you.

You better run. I said run!

[Locker slams]

Everything okay over there?

You the transfer?

Lieutenant Tom hudner.

Jesse brown.

It'â€™s good to meet you.

Where'â€™d you come in from? Pearl harbor.

Flying bearcats? Skyraiders.

Lot of profile flights.
Tracking torpedoes.

Post-war busywork.

You, uh...
You fly in the big show?

I did not.

Then you'â€™ll fit right in.

[Door opens] - [Soldier]
What are you talking about?

You should be grateful your room has seen action.
Morning, Jesse.

Good morning, Jess.

You'â€™re the one with
clean sheets.

Hey! You must be the new guy.

Marty goode, with an "e."

You mean "g"?"E" at the end.

Oh, Jesus! Don'â€™t tell me
you'â€™re one of these country boys.

[Soldier 2] All right,
Marty. Watch yourself.

Bo lavery.

And this is Jerry,

or kraut, Fritz, heine.

They all work.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nice to meet you. And
regardless of what you hear,

the name'â€™s Carol mohring.

Pleasure to meet you.

[Soldier 3]
Now, there'â€™s a sight.

Good to see you, bill. Good to see you.

Gents, this is Tom hudner.

We were in pensacola together.
Hell of a stick.

Hell of a pretty face, too.

Almost too pretty.

You boys sound lonely.[All chuckle]

Welcome to vf-32.

[Muffled explosion]

[News presenter] Will the atom
shatter a world to fragments,

or will it be a boon to mankind?

Stalin and the Soviets
field-tested their own bomb,

and wouldn'â€™t you know it,
it'â€™s the same design as ours.

I'â€™d say that they'â€™re
hot on our heels,

but this footage is
already six months old.

It won'â€™t be long before they
strap that thing to a bomber.

Bo, get that for me, would you?

So, now you know.

Fellas, you'â€™re not just here
to fly and screw.

'â€™cause they'â€™re not
sitting idle.

But with practice, there
is not a pilot on this planet

who can wipe the ass of a
United States naval aviator

and I truly believe that.

[Pilot] That'â€™s right!
[Whooping]


Koenig, you got mohring.

Lavery, you got goode.

Ensign brown!
Sir.

You'â€™ve got
lieutenant hudner today.

Yes, sir.

Have fun.

Matt, you take Calloway.[Chuckles]

All right,
maps out, lights on, let'â€™s go.

[Bo] See if you can keep up.
[Marty] Let'â€™s go.

[Bo] Whoo-hoo!
[Carol] All right, bill. You ready?

'â€™cause if you bring that girl around,
you'â€™re gonna have a problem.

lap. What are you talking about?

That'â€™s all I'â€™m saying.

Pretty warm out for a wool cap.

It'â€™s part of my kit. Never
know when you'â€™ll need it.

[Soldier on pa]
Personnel, stand clear.

I'â€™ll try to keep us
short of Canada, lieutenant.


[Jesse on radio]
Watch your prop.

Try not to cut off my wing.

[Engines roaring]

We'â€™re taking a slight detour
on the way home.

Try to keep up.
Say again?

[Engine whirs]


[Engines roaring]

[Breathes heavily]


[Tom on radio] What the hell
are you doing, ensign brown?


[Watch ticks]

You still with me?

[Breathes heavily]

Up and hard on my call.

[Engines roaring]

Ready, set, hit it!



Any detours you wanna make?

[Chattering]
[Jazz playing on radio]

Pretty slick flying
for a nav hop.

Helps to know the plane.

Can'â€™t learn everything
from a book.

[Metal clanks]

Or at the academy.

Well, there'â€™s knowing the
plane and then there'â€™s flat-hatting.

What are you gonna find out
about your wingman

cruising at 10,000 feet,
lieutenant?

Put him in a little bit
of trouble, who knows,

you might get a peek at
who he really is.

How 'â€™bout I buy you a beer?

Plenty to talk about
between who I am

and not getting each other
killed on nav hops.

Sounds nice, lieutenant,

but I Don'â€™t drink.

Did you get to see
the lighthouse?

I did.

["Stagger Lee" playing]


â™ª Stagger Lee went home â™ª

[Pilot laughs]

â™ª And he got his... â™ª

It'â€™s chow time, boys.

[Pilot laughs] All right.

â™ª Said I'â€™m goin'â€™ to the barroom
just to pay... â™ª

Hey, Marty, pass me
one of those forks.

[Bill] This looks delicious.
Bon appÃ©tit, boys.


one of them napkins.

all right.

Tends to be a little busy.

Lot of locals,

but a lot of college girls

who like to go out
on school nights.

Sadao'â€™s is good on Thursdays.

Dimber'â€™s is the move to make
on Saturdays and sundays,

if you Don'â€™t mind the cover.

Just think of that as
an investment though.

Trust me.

But, I gotta warn ya,

no matter where you go,
it is rough these days.

All right, girls around here do
not go for participation medals.

Despite what they say, they
are looking for that war tin.

That hero tin.

And here, that'â€™s only cevoli.

Got a Navy cross
and he'â€™s got a wife.

Might be connected.

Wait, you ain'â€™t married,
are you?

No. I'â€™ll start with the Navy,
figure out the rest later.

Smart man.

How'â€™d you come in?

Applied to the academy
right after Pearl harbor.

I wanted to help.

As we all did.

But yeah, show up
to find the heroes are made,

the fleets mothballed.

Mm-hmm.

War ended a month
before I graduated.

You know, I suppose we were
born a few years too late.

Or too early.

The whole world'â€™s
looking different.

Hell, did you ever think
that you'â€™d be in a squadron

with a colored aviator?

[Clears throat] Well, I
didn'â€™t come here to not eat.

Cheers to that.

How are the clams?

[Dog barks in distance]

["Little red rooster" playing
on record player]

â™ª Got a little red rooster
and man, how he can crow â™ª

â™ª got a little red rooster
and man, how he can crow â™ª

â™ª he'â€™s the boss of the barnyard

Hi. [Chuckles]

You are just in time
to get dinner together.

Yes, ma'â€™am.Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]

But may I have a dance first?

Always.

Always.

â™ª Man, he ain'â€™t no bluff â™ª

[Both moan]

â™ª If you want your red rooster
and you want him all alone â™ª

I saw our neighbor on my way in.

I saw her this morning.

She looked like a nice woman.

Someone can look nice?

Didn'â€™t I?

I thought you looked like

a mean old hen.

Oh!


Daisy? mm-hmm?

Oh![laughs]

Oh![laughs]

Come on.
[Gasps]

Whoo!


Strength in numbers,
darling.Mm-hmm.

You gonna paint your baby?
I'â€™ma paint one of my babies.

Nah. Come on, come on!


Come on.


Incoming!


Well, I know a pilot
can'â€™t fly at night.

she got that from.

Where they go?

Where they go?

Where they... there! [Laughs]

Ah! It'â€™s us. Okay, okay.

We surrender.

Well, it was well fought, soldier,
but sadly, you were no match.

[Both laugh][Knock on door]

Officers.

Awfully loud in here.

Neighbors made
a noise complaint.

Must'â€™ve been
the nice-looking one.

[Drill instructor]
â™ª what I'â€™ve been told â™ª

what I'â€™ve been told â™ª

[Drill instructor]
â™ª Navy wings are painted gold â™ª

wing walkers for a respot.

[Soldier on pa] All yellow
shirts on fod walk down.

Morning, boys!

Seems one of
our reconnaissance planes

went down over the baltic
a few days ago.

Now, what you won'â€™t
see here in the newspaper

is the photos the Pentagon has

of Navy flight uniforms
washed up on the shore

and the landing gear,

which is absolutely
riddled with bullets.

That is more than
a quiet act of aggression.

Washington wants us ready
to respond to the Russians

and, uh, this is what
we'â€™re gonna get ready with.

to the f4u corsair.

Flew the hog
a little after the war.

But the Navy'â€™s gone and
made 'â€™em fatter and meaner.

Now, I know that the corsair will be
new for a lot of you, but Don'â€™t worry.

Just like yours truly, she
earned her stripes in the big show.

Now, this is a plane that will
get your hands dirty.

You'â€™re gonna be
so close to the action,

you'â€™re gonna start to think that you
made the mistake of joining the army.

And I gotta mention, she'â€™s got
a rather unfortunate nickname.

"The widow-maker."

Good thing I ain'â€™t hitched.

Well, they also call her
the "ensign eliminator."

This engine'â€™s one of the most
powerful things you'â€™ll ever fly behind.

You throttle her too hard,
she'â€™ll spin you over.

She'â€™s got enough torque to flip a
house, so go easy on the power.

Cag wants us
up to speed and fast.

So, manuals are getting
dropped off in the ready room.

Any other questions,

god help ya, take 'â€™em up with
the good professor koenig here.

All right.

[Tom] Oh, she looks pretty mean, huh?
[Marty] The "widow-maker."


[Carol] Hey, professor k?
[Bo] She'â€™s awful purdy.

what you'â€™re doing with this thing.


[Engine hisses]

Need a lift?

Guys said you had family nearby?

Across the bay in fall river.

They must be happy,
having you back.

I think they'â€™d be happier if I were
coming back to work for the family.

Supposed to take over
my old man'â€™s grocery stores.

[Smacks lips]

But I was called to adventure.

What about you?

What brought you here?

Always wanted to fly.

Wanted to fly where
the best pilots flew.

That'â€™d be the Navy.

[Jesse] Thanks for the lift.
[Tom] Of course.

Ma'â€™am. Tom hudner.

Daisy.

Can I get you
something to drink?

I'â€™m sure lieutenant hudner
has plans.

Better be getting back, ma'â€™am.

Beautiful house, by the way.

Nice to see it from the ground.

Thank you.

Play nice. What?

Play nice.

I Don'â€™t know about him yet.


Where'â€™s our baby?

Sleeping.

Car'â€™s on the side of the road.

Abandoned.

[Daisy sighs] Okay.


[Daisy chuckles]


My tail fin could use some air.

[Soldier on pa]
Stand by for check time.

Stand by for check time.


I think she likes me.

Famous last words.

She'â€™s not gonna bite.

what'â€™s not in the manual?

How big this damn nose is.

How the hell are you supposed to
land on a carrier if you can'â€™t see it?

Not everything'â€™s in the same place,
Carol, but everything'â€™s the same.

Just in different places.

Hey. You know I crashed a
bearcat when I was learning to fly it?

You know, you better not
let goode hear you say that.

Too late.

[Metal creaks]

[Metal creaks]

[Narrator on radio] Many
outstanding fighter pilot achievements

may seem almost unbelievable.

[Engines roaring]

But once you have learned how
they accomplished these victories,

and the system they used,

you'â€™ll realize it'â€™s just
a trick of the trade

carried out by fighting men
with the ability and know-how

that it takes to win
aerial battles.

The keynote of fighter tactics in the
United States Navy today is teamwork.

[Engines roaring]

Teamwork, coordination,
cooperation, call it what you will,

gives the fighter
its greatest value

in escorting bombers and
torpedo planes on their missions.

In enabling fighters
to protect other fighters,

in winning engagements that may
mean the losing or the saving of a carrier.

You have to fight them
with your head,

using your judgment,

your skill in plane-handling,

and your superior gunnery
to turn the odds in your favor.

It'â€™s a matter of life insurance

to make every
split-second count.



As you were, gentlemen.
As you were.

I'â€™m captain Thomas sisson,

and I command the USS Leyte.

Now, we have learned
that the Soviets are jockeying

for a warm water port
in the mediterranean.

Now, they think they can
bully their way into Europe

and spook our new NATO allies.

Well, DC thinks it'â€™s best if
we prevent them from doing so.

And we are crewing up to keep
the cold war from turning hot,

and cevoli here tells me
this is the best place to do so.

We ship out next week.

Look forward to
having you onboard.

All right, all right.

You remember when I told you
to get up to speed, and fast?

I meant speedier and faster.

Carrier quals are at
the end of the week.

You can'â€™t land a corsair
on the Leyte,

uh, you get yourself
a nice dry-land job in Topeka

or some place even shittier,
god help you.

Either way,

start settling up
your bar tab, boys.

We are leaving Rhode Island.


Just because I'â€™m going
doesn'â€™t mean I'â€™m fighting, Daisy.


That'â€™s the deal, darling.

Remember?

We knew this day might come.

And yet it doesn'â€™t
make it any easier.

But we'â€™ll be okay.

Mad...


but okay.

Okay.


Jesse, what'â€™s going on?

Honestly...

My mind'â€™s on landing
that corsair tomorrow.

You never met a plane
you couldn'â€™t land, Jesse.

This plane
will be the death of me.

I can'â€™t see like I can
out of a bearcat.

Fogs my instincts.

Your instincts...

Are one of the few things
in this world that I trust.

And if you can'â€™t
trust that plane,

you gotta put it in whatever
will get you down safe.

Yes, ma'â€™am.

[Marty] You ready, Carol?
[Carol] Try and keep up, Marty.

buys drinks tonight, boys.


we'â€™ll be spending yours.

[Door opens]

[Door closes]

[Breathes deeply]

You ain'â€™t shit.


You ain'â€™t never landing
that plane, nigger.

Boy.

Your monkey-ass
shouldn'â€™t even be flying.


[Breathes heavily]



[Sniffles, breathes heavily]

[Officer on pa] Flight ops
commence, flight ops commence.

Be aware of all prop wash.
All hands on deck.


[Sailor 2] Doing it!

[Officer on pa] All repair
parties, man your stations.

All repair parties,
man your stations.

[Crew shouting, chattering]

[Engine roaring]

[Dick] That'â€™s hudner.
[Carol] Mm-hmm.

[Officer on radio] You'â€™re on a good
approach, hudner. Just keep an eye on the lso.


All right, pretty boy.

[Cable wobbles]

All right, three-to-one
he misses it.

I'â€™ll take the action.

Bonus if he splashes?

we Don'â€™t want him dead.

[Landing gear whirs]

Looks like they wanna see
Jackie Robinson steal home.

[Officer on radio]
Ensign brown, you'â€™re too high.

That'â€™s a shit approach.

Come on. Get your nose up.

Why isn'â€™t he listening
to the lso?


[Engine roars]

[All shout]Geez!

[All shout]


[Officer on radio] That was pretty
close, brown. Do you wanna call it?

I'â€™m coming back around.

[Officer on pa]
Crash crew, stand by.

[Breathes heavily]

[Officer on radio]
You'â€™re still too high, brown.

You'â€™re not in the groove.

I'â€™ll get there.


[Engine roars]

[Cable wobbles]


[All cheer]

All right, Jesse.


[Officer on pa]
Attention, all hands.

Flight operations
commence in one hour.

Fod walk in 15 Mikes.
All available hands on deck.

Fod walk in 15 Mikes.

Doesn'â€™t matter how you did it.
Just matters that you got down, pal.


you all passed
your carrier quals.

[All cheer]

I'â€™m talking about.

Top marks go to... Yeah.

Lieutenant hudner with
the only perfect grade.

Oh, bastard.

Which brings us to ensign brown.

D-n-k-u-a!


We ship out in the morning.

And now is the time,
if you haven'â€™t already,

get all your affairs in order.

All right.

have to get in order, my friend?

[Pilot 2] I'â€™m headed
to Denver, boys.

That was some landing.

[Pilot 3] I'â€™m never
too drunk to drive.

Just trying to
keep it interesting.

You get your car fixed yet?

You heading to the bar
with the guys?

I Don'â€™t think so.

[Clears throat]

Wanna come in?

[Engine stops]

Hey, Daisy?

Yes?

[Door closes]

What did I tell you?

Yes, ma'â€™am.


Oh.

Let me get her.Okay.

Nice to see you again. You as well.


Which one do you like?

The blue one?

The gray one?

The gray one.

You had a good day? Mm-hmm.

Yeah? uh-huh.

What'â€™d you do?

You Don'â€™t remember?

Here you are.

Thought Jesse didn'â€™t drink.

He doesn'â€™t.


Your husband'â€™s
quite the aviator.

Well, he must feel
the same way about you.

Because you and Carol mohring

are the only boys
from fighting 32

that he has ever invited over.

It'â€™s good to know the men
you'â€™re flying with.

See what they'â€™re fighting for.

I like that.

And what about you, Tom?
What are you fighting for?

God, country and honor aside.

You know, Mrs. Brown, I'â€™m...

Hoping to find that out.

[Jesse laughs]

Come on.

Come on.
[Child] Okay.

Don'â€™t be fooled by his
strong, silent act, by the way.

He trusts you,

I swear, he'â€™s the funniest
man you'â€™ll ever know.

I can'â€™t say he'â€™s shown me
that side yet.Mm-hmm.

Something to look
forward to. [Chuckles]

Well, you'â€™re about to spend
a lot of time together.

Lot of time
in very small spaces.

May I ask you a favor?

Of course.

Second he steps on that ship
and into that plane,

I can'â€™t protect him anymore.

So I need you to be there
for my Jesse.

Okay?

Okay.

Okay.


[Child] Hmm.
[Jesse] That was good, yeah?

Uh-huh.mm-hmm.

[Daisy chuckles]

Who is this?

This is Pam.

Hi, Pam.

[Mimics airplane]

I Don'â€™t think she wants to
embarrass you, lieutenant.

[Daisy chuckles]

It'â€™s too late. Come on.

She might hold the stick
better than you.Okay.


Well, I know
it'â€™s our last night here,

so I'â€™ll let you all enjoy it together.
Thank you again for the drink.

You'â€™re very welcome. I'â€™ll walk ya out.

Just be careful.

Worst thing that can happen
to me is a bad sunburn.

You come back as black as you
like, as long as you come home.

'â€™cause you'â€™re taking me to
The Bahamas when you get back.

Bahamas?

If I get some shore time,

I'â€™ll get you one of
those European swimsuits.

One of those two-piece things.

Tootie...

You know you can always
come back here and wave to me.

I'â€™m only 5,000 miles
that way.[Chuckles]

I'â€™ll wave back.Mm-hmm.

The only person I ever met

belonged in the sky.

Just remember you belong
down here with us, too, okay?


I'â€™ll write you
every week.Mm-hmm.

I know you will.


[All panting]

chains down.

[Officer on pa] Secure from
general quarters. All hands!

Secure from general quarters.

Maybe you'â€™d be faster if we
did this in the middle of the night.

What you Don'â€™t
seem to understand

is that someday soon,
this is gonna be real.

And you have to do a
hell of a lot better than that!


All right.

run him down to 2-a.

I am getting tired
of getting ready.

Tired of living in this
floating sardine can.

Tired of you smelling like one.

That'â€™s what men smell like.

Something to look forward to
one day, Fritz.

Most excitement
we'â€™ve seen in days.

[Captain sisson] Ensign brown.

Could I speak to you
for a moment?

Careful what you wish for.

and respot it.

Aye, sir.

Huh.

[Camera pops]

Do we have to do this
above deck?

Oh, yeah. It'â€™s great having
you right in front of your plane.

Relax. You look great.



I guess the Pentagon wanted
something positive for the folks back home.

Help 'â€™em swallow the pill
of another potential war.

What better way than,
"black man makes good?"

He does makes a nice trophy
boy. You ought to be proud, skip.

Shut up, Bo.

you one of the best pilots he'â€™s ever seen,

regardless of color.

[Officer on pa]
Flight checks and fod walks

for fixed-wing and rotary
aircraft must be documented.

That'â€™s kind of him to say,
but I can'â€™t say I'â€™m special.

Well, it must be hard, right?

It must be hard being the only...

A naval aviator? Absolutely.

Landing planes on carriers,
it'â€™s the...

It'â€™s the toughest job there is
for anyone wearing wings.

[Officer on pa]
Heavy maintenance visit

will be performed
in all aircraft...

Come on, ensign brown.
You know what I mean. Jesse'â€™s fine.

Okay, Jesse.

There'â€™s a lot of guys
from different backgrounds,

but there'â€™s only one you.

There'â€™s only one
you, too, sir. [Chuckles]

Look, I mean no disrespect,

but I Don'â€™t think I'â€™m gonna say
what you'â€™re looking for me to say.

All right.

I worked hard
to fly these planes.

It'â€™s all I'â€™ve ever wanted to do.

Harder than I can
put into words.[Dick] Jesse.

Can we get a few more
pictures of Jesse in his plane?

I gotta get my pilots
back to work.

It'â€™ll just take
a minute, lieutenant.

Lieutenant commander.
Have a nice day.


Damn, Jesse. You just put
a letter in the mail.

One a week.

That'â€™s what I told her.

to slow him down.


Hey, we caught your
little circus act up on deck.


Your boy juggle, too? Or...

[Shoes tap]




Guess not.

[Marine scoffs] Well. Nice.

We should have stood
up to that asshole.


Look, I'â€™m just saying we shouldn'â€™t
be letting him run his mouth like that.

[Carol sighs]

all sick of doing busywork,

but, oh, have I got a
chore for a lucky someone.

Not it. Maintenance has replaced

a gyro on one of the corsairs,

I need a volunteer to
make sure all is working.

It'â€™s just a quick
up and down. I thought you said "lucky."

It sounds like a hoot.

Why Don'â€™t we give it to Fritz?

He could use the landing.

[All chuckling]I'â€™ll do it.


Actually,

if you Don'â€™t mind, lieutenant,

lavery'â€™s right for once.

'â€™course I'â€™m right.

I could use the trap.

All yours.

Heil herr mohring!


All right, now as for
the rest of you,

command has ordered an audit

on serial numbers on parts
across all of the planes.

So while mohring is up
there enjoying the sightseeing,

the rest of you can validate
all of the serial numbers

on every single one of
these maintenance orders.

[All groaning]Thank you, Matthew.

Yeah.[Bo] uh, sir?

That'â€™ll take all day.

Only if you work quick.

[Flight officer] Ensign mohring,

you are clear to test the gyro.

2-17 to tower.

Gyro seems to be
in working order.

[Flight officer] Copy
that. Return to carrier.

Ensign mohring,
your approach is shallow.

I'â€™m correcting.

Manufacture number?

"P-5-5-1-8-4."

What is it?

[Breathing heavily]



Just gotta slowly
pour on the power.

On this approach?

Better to wave off.

Try again.

[Flight officer on pa]
Crash crew, stand by.

Crash crew, stand by.

[Crew 3] Man your station.

Out of the way. Coming in.

[Inhales sharply]

[Flight officer on radio]
You'â€™re still low, mohring.

[Crew chattering]

Go around, pal.

Ease it on, mohring.

[Flight officer] Ensign
mohring, give me some altitude.




[Crew 6] Man overboard![Crew
7] get your vest pack!

[Crew 8] We need rescue!

Poured on the power
too damn fast.

[Alarm blaring]

[Crash crew shouting]


[Crew 8] Do we pull him out?

[Alarm continues]

Some people are gonna tell you
that this is what you signed up for.

It'â€™s not.

Let'â€™s be real clear.

We lost a friend.

And that is not easy.

Now,

the Navy'â€™s gonna do
what the Navy does.

But, um...

I'â€™ll write his family.

Send them his things.


The guys are getting together.

Just because you think
you know better

doesn'â€™t mean you
have to say anything.

What are you talking about?[Sniffles]

Carol hadn'â€™t been in
the water five seconds

before you were talking about
what he could'â€™ve done better.

We all make mistakes.
That could'â€™ve been me, that...

Don'â€™t let that ring
convince you otherwise.

What'â€™s the one thing they
told us about the corsair?

Remind me. What'â€™d they
tell us about the corsair?

You can'â€™t punch the throttle.

Mistakes get us killed, Jesse.

You Don'â€™t die if you
do what you'â€™re told.


You coming?

To Carol.

war, and we'â€™re losing men.

Good men.

It'â€™s just a
tough pill to swallow

when there'â€™s nothing to blame.

The swim test
in flight school...

They made me do it ten times.

Didn'â€™t believe that
a nigger could swim.

They dumped ice in the water.

Put weights in my flight suit.

Held me under.

They wouldn'â€™t have cared
if I died in that pool.

But every time...

I made it out.

Got used to flying
the bearcat. [Chuckles]

See everything.

The deck on approach.

in front of me.

I could land it on
my front yard if I had to.

But the corsair...

I can'â€™t see anything.

You have to rely on the lso.

that the lso

won'â€™t crash my black ass
on purpose.

I can'â€™t tell you how many times

people have told me
to give up, quit.

Die, even.

That'â€™s why you can'â€™t always
do what you'â€™re told.

If I did, I wouldn'â€™t be here.


That'â€™s something
I was trying to teach mohring.



I see it. Hell, I am, too.

Been a rough few weeks.

Fortunately,
we are docking in cannes

for a little shore leave.

Now, I Don'â€™t know about you,

but I think some fresh air
would do all of us some good.

[Pilot whistles]Obviously, ship rules
follow you ashore.

Liberty expires at 2300.[Chuckles]

You are foreigners in a foreign
city, and you look the part.

So please, Marty,
please, dear god,

Don'â€™t do anything stupid.Mm-hmm.

Oh, and, uh, no,
I Don'â€™t wanna come with you

and do whatever is it
that you'â€™re gonna do,

but thank you.[Chuckles]

Go away.

[Big band music playing]


Don'â€™t let cevoli catch you
selling those to the locals.

Let me tell you something.

I'â€™ve been in the Navy
since I was 16.

And our line of work
is a dangerous one.

One where tomorrow
is never promised.

Hell, tomorrow'â€™s barely
a gentleman'â€™s agreement.

So if there'â€™s Liberty
to be had... [chuckles]

then Liberty we should take.

At two dollars a pack,
I'â€™ll take a risk.

Let'â€™s enjoy ourselves, boys.

Mohring would insist.

When in France.

There he is.Tom.

[Sailor 1] Don'â€™t do anything
I wouldn'â€™t do, sailor.


Hello.

de la croissant.

Few too many sailors
on this street.

street with a whorehouse on it.

enough scratch or game

for these fine European women.

Hey, I'â€™m here to drink, so
just point me in that direction.

Oh, to the first bar
we find, then.

You guys go ahead.

I gotta find something
for Daisy.

I'â€™ll catch up. All right.

Hey, Don'â€™t forget
the, uh, Lacy bits.

Funny.

[Biker speaking French]

[Beachgoers chattering]

[Child speaking French]

What'â€™s going on?

Are you blind? It'â€™s Liz Taylor.

The movie star.
Where the hell have you been?


Miss Taylor.Mmm.

Would you sign my postcard?

Oh, I Don'â€™t do
signatures, darling.

But I'â€™ll give you a kiss.


Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

And who'â€™s your friend?

He ain'â€™t with me.

Ensign Jesse brown, ma'â€™am.

I'â€™m a naval aviator.

Oh, they let colored folks
be pilots these days?

It would appear so.

Well, how enlightened.

Liz?

I have to run, dear,

but you and your wingmen
should join us at the casino later.

I like pilots.

Miss Elizabeth?

I'â€™m sure you'â€™ve noticed, but...

You just wear something smart,

and you tell them
Elizabeth invited you.


[Chattering in French]

You'â€™re thinking it.[Chuckles]

Ah, look who it is.

Get something nice for Daisy?

Yeah, got something else, too.

I was invited to the casino
de Carlo this evening.

We all were, actually.

By Elizabeth Taylor.[Bo]
You'â€™re shitting me.

Wait, Liz Taylor, the actress?

How? Where?

How? Met her.
Where? At the beach.

Nice lady, actually.


But I got some money to blow.

Let'â€™s see if you'â€™re lying.


Put up or shut up.

Fellas.

Let'â€™s get dressed. Whoo!


Now, I know y'â€™all are used to
getting turned down, but I ain'â€™t.

If we Don'â€™t get in, doubt
this is the only place in town.

Yeah, but this is the only
place with Liz Taylor.

Allegedly.

[Speaking French]

We were invited.

I am certain you were not.

Elizabeth Taylor.
I believe she... please, sir,

leave now.Jesse.

It'â€™s okay.
We'â€™ll go find somewhere else.

Right.

Okay.

[Speaking French]

[Security guard speaking French]
[Clears throat]

This way.

[Jazz music plays]

You sly dog.

Never in doubt.

[Speaks French]

Did you see her? This is... Oh, man!

Women here are...

to make a little money.

Oh, look at this place!
I think we found the party.

[Partygoer] Oh, no!
[Crowd shouts]

Is that... Liz Taylor.

That'â€™s Liz Taylor! Liz Taylor.

That'â€™s Liz Taylor?
She look nice.

Guess I should introduce you.


Fellas?[Marty] mm-hmm?

Kinda nervous.

Well, lookie-loo.

The fighting 32.

You came!

Yes, ma'â€™am.

Do you gentlemen
all know each other?

Just sharing space
at the moment, ma'â€™am.

That'â€™s right.
Until the actual war starts.

And then,
we'â€™ll be on the ground.

And they'â€™ll be nowhere
to be found.

in nursery rhymes?

Please, take a seat.

I could use some
fresh luck anyway.

Yes, ma'â€™am.

Please.

Okay. Why Don'â€™t you
and I grab a drink

and toast to not being
on a ship with these guys?

Come on. Good idea.

Buy a couple rounds on us.

I'â€™ll keep your seat warm.


Let'â€™s go, buddy.
Come on.[Elizabeth] here. And...




[All cheer]


My lucky man.


Cheers, ladies.

To beautiful people,
beautiful life.Cheers.

Yes, cheers. New friends,
future ex-wives.

Here we go. Hey![Laughs]


Whoo![all cheer]


That'â€™s what we call a winner.

Come on!

About time
to call it a night, bubba.

Yes!

Oh, shit.

[Speaking French]

[Both chuckle]

So, you speak French.

I picked it up in high school.

Uh, sir. Uh, whiskey,

and then,
whatever my friend'â€™s having.

[Speaking French]

Show off.

That was pretty good.

It'â€™s good.[Both laugh]

Pretty wild.

Rubbing shoulders
with movie stars.

Drinking, gambling.

The reds are about to strike,

we'â€™re partying in France.


I just want to go home with
this having meant something.

Well...

You just keep it up
with miss Liz Taylor,

and you just might.

[Both laugh]

Thank you.

You forgot the ginger beer.

I saw a place looked real nice.

I'â€™ll get a drink from there.

Hey, pal. Let'â€™s try that.

Let'â€™s try that.

Change of scenery, fellas.

As long as this place has
French women, I'â€™m happy.

We'â€™ll be Jake on that front.

Right, I lost all my
money anyway. Come on.

[Bo] We'â€™re leaving?
Sorry.

Excuse me?

Miss Elizabeth,
thank you for having us.

It was very kind of you.

Well, is that it for you boys?

I'â€™m afraid so.

Hmm. Well,
you be safe out there.

Would you?


Thank you.

[Dice clatters]


the Liberty area.

I won'â€™t tell if you Don'â€™t,
lieutenant. VoilÃ !


VoilÃ , voilÃ ! Look at that.


[Clears throat]


Bonjour.ladies.


Uh, whiskey, please.


Hmm. [Chuckles]


And drinks. Here you go.


So you gotta use what ya got.

Being handsome helped
me land Daisy, but you?

[Smacks lips]

You?

We'â€™re gonna need
a different approach.[Chuckles]

How about...

You'â€™re an American aviator
in France?

That'â€™s all I got?

Gotta play to
your strengths, lieutenant.

Sir.

You'â€™re without your wings.

kidding me.

No, no, Jesse,
I'â€™m not takin'â€™ your wings.

Just borrowing.

Plus, my co refused to pin
'â€™em on me during graduation,

so they'â€™re not
that sentimental.

Now, at least you look the part.


What about
a magic trick? Magic trick?

Yeah. you know magic tricks?

I... I know 'â€™em. I know...

Yes or no? It'â€™s a magic trick.

You know a magic trick? Yeah.

[Both laugh]

Like I said,
you gotta use what you got.


[Speaking French]

"It'â€™s my first time in France."

[Both speaking French]


Sorry. it'â€™s okay. [Laughs]

Just say, "bonjour."

Bonjour. Bonjour.

Bonjour. Bonjour.

[Clears throat]

I'â€™d like to, um,

treat you ladies
to a magic trick.

It'â€™s called the, uh,

fire breathing aviator.

[Both chuckle]

Oh, la, la.[Both laugh]

[Speaks French]

[Tom chuckles]


He'â€™s my third cousin.

I Don'â€™t sound like him, but I
sure as hell look like him, right?

Looks better on you.
You'â€™re the pilot in command.

Baby, I Don'â€™t drink wine. No.

Forgive my uncultured friend.
He doesn'â€™t know a damn thing.

Stick to whiskey.

Oh, they let you in here?

You know, I had something going
with Liz before y'â€™all showed up.


I think she'â€™s married.

Something funny, sideshow?

Excuse me,
just give me one second.

You'â€™re the one
that brought the circus.


What'â€™s going on?[Jesse] nothing.

Everything'â€™s fine.

You need your
pansy-ass friend here

to help you out? Hey.

All right, we can cool it.

We'â€™ve all been drinking.

Tom. I'â€™m good.[Marty] hey, hey.

I... I know.

Yeah, but you won'â€™t be
after I'â€™m done with you.


[Marty] Back up! Tom!
[Buddy] Come on!

Come on! Oh, sorry.

There'â€™s someone there.


Let go of him! Hey! Hey![Whistle blows]

we gotta go! Stop! Stop!

[Bo] Come on! Let'â€™s go! Run!
[Marty] We gotta go. Run!


[Marty] Y'â€™all lucky!
[Buddy] Let'â€™s go!

Hustle, ladies!

Oh, um. [Laughs]

Tom, come on!
Tom, that way! That way!

Oh, god! Go, go, go!

[Siren wailing]

how I do that trick?

I eat the cigarette.

You didn'â€™t have to do that.

I got the kiss.

I wish you hadn'â€™t hit him.

You would'â€™ve done
the same for me.

Not hunting for a thank you.

You were hunting
for a fight though.

Defending my wingman.

I can fight my own fights.

Been doing it
for a long time now.

Jesse brown.

Squadron of one.

Ready room. Asap.
Something big'â€™s going down.



had fun last night,

because the north Koreans
came pouring over the 38th parallel.

They have taken Seoul.

If they take the rest of
the southern peninsula,

it'â€™s on to Japan, and there go
our efforts to contain communism,

so says Washington.

So, what does that mean for us?

It means we'â€™re up.

We'â€™re setting sail for Korea.

Now, I know that
for almost all of you,

this will be the first time
you'â€™re seeing combat.

Your training is important, yes.

And you are sure as hell ready
to do what you need to do.

I made sure of that.

But the most
important thing is this:

We bring everyone home.

We bring everyone home.

be as many as 100,000 Chinese

already in North Korea, ready to
take up the fight at a moment'â€™s notice.

MacArthur ordered b-29'â€™s
to take out two Bridges

along the yalu river,
on the border,

hoping to slow the Chinese
from sending in any more troops.

But they missed.

So, I will lead the fighting 32.

We will take out the
antiaircraft in sinuiju city.

Tarsiers, you will fly support
for the panthers

until it is safe for them to come
in and bomb those Bridges.

This is just a friendly
reminder, gentlemen.

Don'â€™t shoot or bomb anything
on the Chinese side of the river,

unless you wanna be
personally responsible

for starting another world war.

We'â€™re flying directly
into gunfire.

I need everyone sharp.

Be smart.

Be ready.


[Engines roaring]


[Tom on radio] Go ahead, 201.

I seem to be having some trouble
with my landing gear.

Can you confirm?


Uh, 201 to rug.

We got a mechanical issue, and
can'â€™t lead us to the mission area.

Passing the lead to 205.

[Leyte cic on radio] Roger, 205.
You are cleared for the downwind.

Stay on the right side
of the river, Tom.

Yes, sir.

[Engines roaring]

[Breathes heavily]

[Breathes heavily]

[Breathes deeply]

205 is in hot.

[Artillery zipping]



Commencing flak suppression now.

Ah!
[Gasps]

[Jets roaring]

It'â€™s a mig!

Koenig, take goode and lavery.
Stay on the aa.

We'â€™re on it.

Jesse, break left.

Let'â€™s hose this guy.

Roger that!

Happy hunting.

It'â€™s Bo time.

Three good hits.

Coming around for another
run on the aa.

See him?[Jesse] negative.

I got nothing.

[Engine roaring]

[Machine guns firing]

Bandit high! Bandit high! Huh?


Tom! He'â€™s on me pretty good!

I'â€™m gonna bring him to you
through the canyon.

I say we show him
the lighthouse.

Meet me in the middle.

Enemy aa is silenced. I
repeat, enemy aa is silenced.

[Panther lead] Copy that, flight
leader. Approaching target now.

[Breathes heavily] Oh!

[Grunts, breathes heavily]

Come on.

I have a visual on you.

Break right,
up and hard on my call.

Roger that!

Ready, set...

Hit it![Groans]


[Shouts, laughs]

Good hit, Tom!

Quite fine, Jesse! Quite fine!

[Panther lead] This is panther
lead. Approaching target.


Good hit, good hit.

Rear bridge is down.
Coming back around.

panthers.

[Machine gun cocks]

[Panther lead] Flight lead, we'â€™ve
got aa coming from the Chinese side.


Time to bug out.

[Panther lead] Roger that.

205, I still have ordnance.

I can hit the bridge.

It'â€™s too much aa, 211.
Stand down.

Jesse, stand down!
That'â€™s an order!


[Breathes heavily]

[Speaking mandarin]

[Breathes heavily]


That'â€™s a direct hit!

That'â€™s a direct hit!
Bridge is down!


There we go, ace!


Both Bridges have been
destroyed.

Returning to ship.

[Leyte cic on radio] Copy
that, 205. Good work.


one hell of a ride, huh?

Intelligence has confirmed that that
rat line has been crippled. Well done.

[All cheer]

Now, we are all
still on standby,

but everybody go get yourselves
cleaned up for some chow.


Let'â€™s get some food. Good job, Tom.

Here'â€™s the mission report.

Well done, hudner.

How you feeling?

Good.

Hmm.

Sit down.

[Clears throat]

Meh.


That feeling?

That'â€™s the mundanity
of a job well done.

You know how many wars there
have been in the history of mankind?

No, course not.

'â€™cause most wars are forgotten.

All the men who fought in 'â€™em,

and all the medals they won.

Heroes and hardware fade
to the back of the history books

because it'â€™s not about war.

This war never ends, there'â€™s
no v day, there'â€™s no finish line.

The real battle in all of life

is being someone
that people can count on.

And that isn'â€™t defined
in a single moment.

You earn that with
a lifetime of showing up.

These conflicts, they Don'â€™t define
you, Tom. You Don'â€™t want 'â€™em to.

Trust me.

[Lighter flicks]
Go get something to eat.

Go on.

Hey, Tom.

What'â€™s the most
important thing?

Bring 'â€™em home.

You did.

that is absolutely true.

[Marine 2] This is wisdom-seven. Enemy
troops estimate company size and two tanks...

[Marine 3 on radio] Personnel
tango-Romeo-5-2-5-3-9-0.

You know what else I could use?


Fire?

The sun, maybe?

Another shot with Liz Taylor.

Oh, Jesus! Buddy,
you gotta stop saying that.

You never had a shot with Liz.

Uh, you weren'â€™t
paying attention.


I would take feeling in my toes

rather than a shot
with Liz right now.


You think
they'â€™ll hit us tonight?

I would.

You ever got anything nice
to say?

[Flare fires, hisses]

[Bullet buzzes][Grunts]


Corpsman!

doing fine. I got you.


Move left![Marine 2] fire at will!


Incoming!

[Gunshot echoes]

What'â€™s going on?

Looks like
the mission report said

I ignored my commanding
officer'â€™s orders.

Well, you know
how this stuff works.

I only wrote down what happened.

I'â€™m glad that'â€™s what
you saw, lieutenant.

It'â€™s what happened.

Look, what difference does
it make? We got the job done.

Insubordination.

That'â€™s what they'â€™re putting
in my fitness report.

Uh, no, cevoli'â€™s gotta
understand...

It'â€™s coming from
above cevoli, Tom.

Skipper'â€™s already read it.

Jesse, I didn'â€™t
want that to happen.

What did you want to happen,
Mr. Academy?

Sorry, pal.

You really hamstringed
me on this one. [Chuckles]

I can'â€™t get promoted
with that on my report.

You ever think we'â€™d see a mig?

Hell, I thought goode was gonna
bail out all the way back to Brooklyn.

You'â€™re the one who shit his
pants when the mig swooped in.

By the way, you changed your diaper
yet? Why Don'â€™t you come check?

Yeah, we'â€™re lucky we made it
out alive the way you two shoot.

How'â€™s that for aim?[Laughs]

[Knock on door]

I need your help with something.

[Officer on pa]
All blue shirts on duty...

[Jesse, muffled]
Boy, you stole it.

That'â€™s a white man'â€™s uniform.

[Officer on pa] All blue shirts
on duty report to main hangar 3.

in that.

Eh, boy?

Think I'â€™ll make it out...

Every hateful word
anyone'â€™s ever said to me.

Wrote it down.

Repeat it to myself.

Been doing it since I was a boy.

It helps.

What'â€™s that?

Testimonies from the guys.

Saying how the mission was
complicated, and you did the right thing.

It'â€™ll fix whatever remark
they put in your report.

There'â€™s a...
There'â€™s a way things work

you'â€™re not always
gonna understand.

A slap on my wrist, it'â€™s... it'â€™s
not the same as a slap on yours.


This won'â€™t help.

I'â€™m sticking
my neck out for you.

Sticking your neck out?

With a piece of paper?

Tom...

That paper cost you nothing.

Nothing!

You know how tired
I am of people

trying to help me
while looking down on me?

I'â€™m not looking down on you.

What do you want me to do?

Just be my wingman, pal.

That'â€™s it.

Forget the life saver,
and get in the damn water!

Please, Tom!

Ensign brown?

We were waiting for you back in
the wardroom, but you never showed.

Needed some time alone.

Bunch of us brothers
across the ship been talking.

Heard you had some
real good shooting yesterday,

and we just wanna
let you know we see you.

[Sailor 1] Yeah, my rack man
knows how to fix it. I'â€™ll get him.

[Sailor 2] On it. Now get these
back on the cleats, too.

[Sailor 3] Tab it, Mark it off.

Bunch of us chipped in
back in cannes.

What'â€™s your name, sailor?

Fambrough.

Archie fambrough, sir.

Jesse.

Archie.

Tell the brothers
I appreciate it.

[Helicopter whirring]

it to the deck! We should be good.


[Corpsman 2]
That'â€™s it, easy. Easy!

Be gentle now. All right,
let'â€™s go, let'â€™s go, come on!

We got you.
[Corpsman 3] He'â€™s packaged.

Gonna be okay.

Move! Doc'â€™s waiting downstairs.

We got you, bud.

[Sailor 1] Aye, aye, sir,
they'â€™re up and running.

[Sailor 2] Hey, double time it
back to your station.


Charlie ward.

We went to
flight school together.

Alabama ward? The very one.

You flying eggbeaters now?

The Navy must'â€™ve heard I was looking
for something stupid and dangerous.

Besides, I wouldn'â€™t feel right
sharing the fixed-wing skies

with a southern legend.

Always knew you'â€™d make it,

but it is damn good
to see you, Jesse.

Although, I wish it were
under better circumstances.

Good to see you, pal.

Take care of yourself,
Mississippi.

'â€™bama!

I married her.


Oh, we home, baby.

You wanna get down?[Grunts]

Okay.


Jesse.


I hope this letter
reaches you in time,

because I wanted to be the first

to wish you
a very happy birthday.

I know it'â€™s hard to plan
a party from across the world,

but I thought of something fun
we might be able to do together.

Grab Pam.

Got something for her, too.


"Oh, it'â€™s dark
and it'â€™s cramped

in this spot we'â€™ve all been.

It'â€™s a place for a chick,
but not a mean, old hen."

"It'â€™s dark and it'â€™s cramped,
in this spot we'â€™ve all been."

Daddy got us a gift.Oh.

Yeah.


Miss Pam, look.


found a little box in Pam'â€™s closet.

I'â€™m going to close now.

I'â€™ll write to you
as soon I can.

Your devoted husband.

Lovingly and completely yours.

I'â€™ll love you forever.

Jesse.

Just talked to some of those
injured soldiers that are arriving.


They'â€™re from
the 1st marine division.

a ride with us from quonset.

They'â€™re pinned down
at hagaru base.

They'â€™re saying that
it'â€™s an unspeakable hell.

For every one marine,

there are six Chinese
hiding in the woods.

Gets below minus 30 at night.

Those boys are holding on
by their fingernails.

Some air support would be
mighty welcome. Hmm?

Punch a hole in that wall. Take away
the Chinese numerical advantage.

Give our guys a chance
to get back up on their feet.

This is a dangerous mission.

It is dangerous in a different
way than sinuiju, okay?

This is not about
Bridges and rat lines.

This is about thousands of
Chinese soldiers hiding in the woods

and shooting at you
from 20 feet below.

This is extremely
hazardous duty.

I am not gonna sugarcoat it.

Men need help,

and they need what
only we can give 'â€™em.

So, I'â€™m gonna take you there.

We'â€™re gonna give 'â€™em hell.

We'â€™re gonna get
those marines back.

Let'â€™s get outta here.

[Plane roaring][Marine] two o'â€™clock!
Comin'â€™ at ya!

[Marine 1] I can'â€™t see it.
[Marine 2] I got him!

I got him!

[Artillery approaching]




Buddy, hey!

You'â€™re good, you'â€™re good.

Come on, come on.
You'â€™re good. Go!

You'â€™re good. Go!


[Soldiers shouting]


Two o'â€™clock!

[Marine 2] Bring it out!

You know any good prayers?

Come on, we'â€™ve seen
worse than this!

If you want a prayer, "dear
god, send us some angels."

[Marine 1] There!
The tree line! Light 'â€™em up!

Fire 'â€™em up![Marine 2] yeah,
get 'â€™em, boys!


[Marine 3] Move! Move! Move! Come on!

Can'â€™t let the flyboys
take all the credit!



[Marine 4] Get down, get down!
Let'â€™s go! Let'â€™s go! Let'â€™s go!



[Marine 5] Yeah!

You see that?
We got a negro pilot!


[Dick on radio] Looks like
we got the Chinese running,

but let'â€™s get
a closer look, boys.

Rendezvous on me.

[Shouting in mandarin]

211, you got a streamer.
I think you'â€™re losing fuel.

It'â€™s not fuel.

She'â€™s bleeding oil.

[Engine sputtering]

She'â€™s not staying up
in the air much longer.

Let'â€™s climb. Find a
place to put her down.

nice and easy, Jesse.

Jesse, at your 10:00.

It could work.

Eyes on it.

Flight lead,
I'â€™m following him down.

Copy that.
We'â€™ll keep an eye on you.

Switching radio to
search and rescue.

Checklist?

Go ahead.

[Breathing heavily]
Salvo rockets.

Release drop tanks.

Canopy back and locked.

[Breathing heavily][Wind whistling]


Deadstick.

Deadstick.

I'â€™m not gonna make
the clearing.


[Breathing heavily]

You'â€™re at 200 feet.

She won'â€™t go any slower.

I can'â€™t stick with you.

That'â€™s the whole
nine yards, Tom.

[Breathing heavily]


[Breathing heavily]

Come on! Come on.


211, come in.

211, come in.

Tom, once Jesse gets cleared,
you scuttle that plane.

We can'â€™t have the corsair
falling into enemy hands.

[Breathing heavily]

He'â€™s not moving.

Come on, Jesse. Come on.

Come on, Jesse. Come on.


What'â€™s he doing?

Why isn'â€™t he getting out?

If we can see the smoke,
the Chinese can, too.

He should'â€™ve been out by now.


That fire is gonna
eat him alive.

Come on, Jesse.
Get out of there.

[Breathing heavily]

I'â€™m gonna go get Jesse.

get yourself killed.

your own plane.

The hell are you doing, hudner?

Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Iroquois, 201.

Rdf call. I have one,
soon-to-be two pilots down.

Request immediate assistance.

[Leyte cic] 201,
you are in hostile airspace.

Search and rescue is still
estimating 30 minutes out.

Return to ship.

[Breathing heavily]

Tom, search and rescue
is 30 minutes out,

but help is on the way.

Be careful down there.

Yes, sir.







You just ruined a perfectly
good corsair, lieutenant.

I think that'â€™s going
in the mission report.


That'â€™s a negative.
We can'â€™t send an angel.

Our choppers
can'â€™t fly in the dark.

It'â€™s way too dangerous.

Who'â€™d they say is down?

[Dispatch officer]
Two corsairs from vf-32.

Lieutenant hudner
and an ensign brown.

[Radio chatter]

Tell 'â€™em I'â€™m coming.

[Both grunting]

Stuck in good, Tom.

I'â€™m gonna put out this fire.

We'â€™ll get you
out of here, okay?



Should we get you out of here?

Can we push?

One.

Two.

Three.

[Metal creaking][Jesse grunts]

[Both grunting]


[Breathing heavily]

Up and hard on my call.

[Jesse grunts]

[Metal creaking]


[Breathing heavily]

[Explosions,
gunfire in distance]

[Helicopter approaching]

Jesse, you hear that?

[Breathing heavily]

They'â€™re coming for us.


inside.[Charlie] take the axe.

We got enemy not far
away. We gotta work fast!



Tom!

Just...

Tell Daisy...

How much I love her.

We'â€™re getting you out of here.



Hudner!





We have to leave now.


I'â€™ll come back for you.

Tom, keep warm, all right?

Coffee down there.

We'â€™ll get you out of here soon.


We can'â€™t get Jesse.

The area is totally overrun.

Search and rescue
is too dangerous.

Skipper has asked us
to scuttle both planes.

Hudner, doc has grounded you.

This is a funeral flight, men.

This is your only chance
to say goodbye.

Wheels up in 15.

Oh, Tom...

I know.[Sniffles]

Yesterday, we lost
a great aviator.

Ensign Jesse brown.

His loss is felt
all across this ship,

and will certainly be felt
all across our nation.

Our country needed Jesse brown.

Jesse. don'â€™t worry about that.

[Giggling, gasps]



Mrs. Brown. I'â€™m seaman
first class Clara Carrol.

It'â€™s a pleasure meeting you.

Come right this way.


Excuse me.

Daisy.

These are yours.

I can imagine this is a lot.

I can'â€™t imagine
how you must... i'â€™m okay.

But thank you.


I was afraid of
coming here today.

More afraid than
I'â€™ve been in my life.

To face you knowing i... Tom, I appreciate
what you did.

And I hope you know that.

I was with Jesse before he died.

He was calm throughout it all.

I was with him to the very end.

The last words out of
his mouth were for you.

He said,

"just tell Daisy how
much I love her."


I'â€™m sorry I couldn'â€™t save him.

Tom, that was never your job.

Never anyone'â€™s job
to save Jesse.

I asked you to be there for him.

And you were.

and climb into the rack.

I honestly dread going to bed,
but I usually dream of you,

so I'â€™ll manage to make it until
we'â€™ll share our bed together again.

Darling,

pray that it'â€™ll be soon.

I have to fly tomorrow...

But so far as that goes,

my heart hasn'â€™t been
to the earth

since the first time
you kissed me.

And when you love me,

you send it clear
out of this world.

I'â€™ll write you
as soon as I can.

I love you forever.

Your devoted husband,

lovingly and completely yours.

Forever.

Jesse.
