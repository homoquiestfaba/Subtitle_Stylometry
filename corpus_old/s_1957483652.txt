Christopher Titus 2017 Born with A Defect

Hello Everyone! Yes! Hello!

Way too much! Alright! Good!
Very nice! Thank you!

Ok, alright. Thatâ€™s enough.

I have a show to do.

Iâ€™ve never talked about this
before, Iâ€™m gonna talk about it nowâ€¦

I was born with a defect, um,

I was actually born a
child, and,

I donâ€™t understand how
human beings run anything.

Weâ€™re the only species born
without ability or instinct.

Every other animal has it.

Dolphin,
swims for its first breath.

Deer, walks in an hour.

Human child needs two
adults around it for 5 years

so it doesnâ€™t
choke on a Cheerio.

If babies didnâ€™t smile
cute they would be food.

Babies are worthless,
thereâ€™s nothing there.

Having a baby is
like buying a laptop

that wonâ€™t turn on
and shits itself.

We canâ€™t even survive
the first couple years

unless someoneâ€™s ramming a nipple
in our face every two hours.

I still feel like that to this
day, anyone else?

Yeah. Yes, thank you.

But,

if itâ€™s a boy child,
the nippleâ€™s rammed in too often,

he has a problem with
women later in life.

And if itâ€™s a girl child,

the nippleâ€™s rammed
in too often,

she â€œexperiments in collegeâ€

You know what you did.

Every other animal on the
planet has fear programmed.

We invented the X-games.

Every other animal hears a combine
going through the corn field,

hears that motor
â€“ hides in a hole.

A human toddler hears a combine
going through a corn field,

runs in front of it and goes

â€œDaddy! Truck!â€

Thhrrtthrrrt, â€œAhhh, dammit.
Gotta clean out the shoot again.â€

Thatâ€™s right. Joke number five

we chopped up a
child in a combine.

Are you guys ready? Good.

Good. Yeah, yay! Wooo!

Every other animal on the planet

is instinctively afraid of fire.

Human beings learn about fireâ€¦

By touching fire.

Thatâ€™s defective.
How did we get the keys to this planet?

Now, my brother learned
about fire when he was 10,

because 10-year-old boys are just
pyromaniac puppies with opposable thumbs.

And we had a real
cool uncle growing up.

Remember that cool uncle we all had
â€“ he was so cool when you were a kid!

And then you became
an adult and realized

someone should have
called child services.

â€œHey, hereâ€™s a magazine.
Put that under your bed

â€“ donâ€™t tell your dad, huh?

Hey, you ever tried
120 proof Whiskey?

Donâ€™t tell your dad, huh?

Donâ€™t sign anything from
the God Damn government.

I signed your dadâ€™s name,
donâ€™t tell your dad, huh?â€

That uncle.

When we were little,
he would do like, the thumb trick.

I mean the, the thumbâ€¦ notâ€¦

thatâ€™s the other uncle.

Thatâ€™s, no.

He would do â€“ the magic trick.

But as we got
older in my family,

uncle started giving us
criminal knowledge at barbeques.

And we were always hanging out with
him and the adults werenâ€™t there,

I guess in case
they had to testify,

I donâ€™t know why.

And one day my uncle just
comes out on Fourth of July

with this giant can
of bug spray and goes

â€œKids,
you know bug sprayâ€™s flammable?

Donâ€™t tell your dad!â€

Pulls a lighter and just goes

PHHFFFFFHHHHHH

and we were little
kids, we were just like

â€œTHATâ€™S THE COOLEST
THING WEâ€™VE EVER SEEN!â€

And now as an adult I realize

ITâ€™S ALSO HOW THEY TRAIN ISIS!!

But you canâ€™t show
little kids thisâ€¦

so this knowledge beats around in
my brothers head for three months

and then one day
in the backyard,

it pops like a stupidity zit

And we had these giant concrete
planters in our backyard

that my dad hadâ€¦

stolen from work.

Or as dad said â€œIt aint stealinâ€™
if they aint usinâ€™ â€˜em!â€

â€œThen why are we picking
them up at midnight, dad?â€

â€œCuz they aint usinâ€™
â€˜em, dumb-ass!â€

Some of these jokes dad
wrote when he was alive, soâ€¦

So my brother gets this
big giant can of bug napalm

and starts just filling
up this planter with mist

and heâ€™s throwing matches into
it, and it was working,

it was â€œPHHHFHHHHâ€

it was like a KISS
concert in the backyard.

Without the 55-year-old women
flashing their boobs â€“ oh my God.

Yeah, thereâ€™s a day for all
of us to keep our shirts down.

And if you donâ€™t know that day â€“
ask a friend, theyâ€™ll be honest.

I have to do a little side-bar.

I actually did a show a while back,
four years ago up in Northern California

for uh, Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar, then
we opened this big thing for a radio station.

Itâ€™s 15,000 seats, I go up.
Iâ€™m doing jokes.

In the middle of me doing jokes,

some 450 lb.,
like 60-year-old woman just goes

â€œRAAAAAAAAAAH.â€

You MAY be able to play guitarâ€¦

but itâ€™s hard to tell jokes
with puke in your mouth.

So, my brotherâ€™s setting
these planters afire.

He does that for like an
hour, then he gets bored,

and heâ€™s a 10-year-old boy so he
wants some more pyrotechnic knowledge,

cuz he knows one day
he may be a warlock.

He snaps a branch off a tree,

makes a fuse out of it,

strips it all down,
puts it in the bottom of the planter,

coats it in this horrible,
toxic, cancer-causing bug juice,

fills it with mist again,

and heâ€™s gonna light it.

But before he lights it,
he wants to see whatâ€™s gonna happen,

so he takes his face,

and he puts it in the planter.

And this is why Iâ€™m pissed Youtube
didnâ€™t exist when I was a child.

Cuz this is,
this is sponsorship money right here.

And he lights it,
and before he can move a millimeter,

goes SHHHHOOPPPPHHHHH!

Yeah...yeah.

And when he stood
up â€“ he was tan.

Eyebrow-less.

And the center part of his
hair, right here, was missing.

He looked like a 10-year-old
middle-aged accountant.

With hair plugs.
Just ash on top of his head.

And I come home like an hour
later and he is freaking out

â€œOH MY GOD, LOOK WHAT I
DID â€“ DADâ€™S GONNA KILL ME!â€

And Iâ€™m the older brother,
I said â€œCalm down, Dad IS gonna kill you.

But why stress if you
know itâ€™s gonna happen?â€

â€œShut up man,
you gotta help me!â€

â€œI canâ€™t help you â€“ youâ€™ve
disfigured yourself.

I think we canâ€™t like, shave the dog and
made a tiny toupee, itâ€™s gonna be stupid.

I mean, Iâ€™ll get out a Sharpie
and draw on your eyebrows for you,

youâ€™re gonna look like a pirate
on chemo thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m gonna say.

ARG!â€

Remember when you were a kid and
you committed that household felony?

We all did it, the big one.
Iâ€™m talking the big one.

You had the water fight in
the house with the hose.

Drywall had to be replaced.

Threw a firecracker in the toilet
â€œJust to see whatâ€™s gonna happen.â€

Gave one of your friends antifreeze
and told him it was Gatorade.

Had to watch the EMTâ€™s drive
off to get his stomach pumped

AND YOU KNEW PARENTS
HAD BEEN CALLED.

And all you had to
do was wait for Dad.

And I wasnâ€™t in trouble, so it was fun.
I got to observe.

And you could see the stress tumors
metastasizing in my brother as it got closer.

And at 5:30 you hear the car
pull in the driveway and,

I have to admit,
my brother took it like a man.

He went and stood right in
front of the front door just

he looked like a guy on death
row in a Johnny Cash song just

â€œIâ€™m gonna have to pay
for what I done...â€

And my father opens the door, puts his
briefcase down, looks at my brother and goes

â€œHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!â€

And my brother goes â€œDad,
let me tell you what happenedâ€

â€œI donâ€™t care what
happened â€“ hahhahaha â€“

whatever you did, you paid for it.
Haha.

DONâ€™T DO IT AGAIN GOD DAMMIT!â€

Weâ€™re idiots.

As a species itâ€™s
just, weâ€™re idiots.

And I am a father, which just,
you know, was just a mistake.

And frightens people.

When I tell people I have kids,
they donâ€™t go â€œboys or girls?â€

they go â€œReally?

They okay?â€

â€œEhhhhh,

compared to me? Uh, yeah.â€

I have two kids.
Uh, two marriages.

And a parade of stress polyps
in my colon having a rave.

And if youâ€™re a parent tonight,
you know what a joy having children is.

And if youâ€™re a parent tonight, you know itâ€™s
hard to say that sentence without laughing.

Every parent in this room
at one point has stared

into their childrenâ€™s yellow,
hazy, sugar-fueled eyes and thought

â€œI was tricked.

I could have been something.

Next Thanksgiving Iâ€™m punching
my mom in the throat."

And thatâ€™s where
love comes from.

And I want to be clear â€“ I do love
my kids because I... hate jail.

And this is about the time of the show where
women tend to get a little stink-face going on.

Theyâ€™re like â€œOh my God whatâ€™s
he talking about? Kids are great.

What is he talking about? Theyâ€™re amazing,
theyâ€™re little Jesus tears, thatâ€™s what they are.â€

No, not all. No.

Theyâ€™re little Jesus hemorrhoids,
thatâ€™s what they are.

Yeah. They are painful,
annoying and hard to get rid of.

I just described a hemorrhoid.
Thatâ€™s a hemorrhoid.

Alright, let me ask you parents who actually
think their kids just â€œrule the world,

theyâ€™re the greatest
thing ever.â€

Whenâ€™s the last time your kid
walked in the room and said

â€œMom, Dad,
can I help you with anything?

Mom, Dad what would YOU
like for Christmas?â€

Do you realize if you had a
friend that borrowed $20 from you

so he could go out and buy
you a shitty birthday present,

you would stab him in
the face with a fork?

Yeah I want to be clear about what
tonightâ€™s show is gonna be about.

If you are a parent,
tonightâ€™s show is therapy.

If you donâ€™t have kids, tonightâ€™s
show is 90 minutes of birth control.

Youâ€™re welcome. You.
Are. Welcome.

Theyâ€™re horrible, man.

Having a kid is like putting
all your money into asbestos.

Dangerous, causes disease and if
itâ€™s yours, youâ€™re liable for it.

They are. Theyâ€™re just little
disease-filled skin-bags,

passing onto you every disease thatâ€™s
floating through its preschool, man.

Preschool, just a viral hot-zone full
of patient zeros, thatâ€™s all it is.

A room full of
sociopathic humans

who can play board games while
SITTING IN THEIR OWN FECES.

THATâ€™S MENTAL PATIENT BEHAVIOR!

And every parent in this room
at one point has had a sick kid,

and sent it to school anyway.

Yeaaah. I know you people without kids are
thinking â€œThatâ€™s horrible, thatâ€™s irresponsible!â€

Well, maybe, but also,
sometimes you need a couple fuckinâ€™ hours.

The problem is every other
parent did the same thing,

or that joke would
have gotten one laugh,

and we would have beat the Hell out of
that person for making our kid sick.

The problem is we all send them to
school, put them in one room,

see what kind of Ebola
cocktail they can come up withâ€¦

Iâ€™m not worried about terrorists
coming up with a super-plague

â€“ Iâ€™m worried about it being weaponized at
naptime. Thatâ€™s when itâ€™s gonna get weird.

You know whoâ€™s going to
survive the apocalypse?

Cockroaches and
Kindergarten teachers.

Cuz their immune system
is just AMAZING. Yeah,

â€œKnock her down,
we gotta get the antidote.â€

Theyâ€™re horrible. Any why is every little
kid under 6 always oozing something?

What the Hell is
coming out of them?

Itâ€™s not a solid,
itâ€™s not a liquid,

itâ€™s nowhere on the element
chart, what is it?

How come every kid under 6
is just a little bit steamy?

Have you ever
touched a little kid?

Itâ€™s like Ch-Chhh â€œAhhhhhh.â€

Trying to pull your hand out is like
trying to get Velcro off a poodle

â€“ Ch-Chhhh â€œEhhhh!

What the Hell is on you?â€

â€œThereâ€™s nothing on me!â€

Pppppfffthhhhhhh-pppffffffff.

And they love it.
Whatever goo that is,

they love it. They love it.
I can prove it.

Try to wipe any kid
under 6 with a napkin.

Itâ€™s like youâ€™re
pepper-spraying them.

How defective is that?

Youâ€™re literally covered in slime that
could wipe out an indigenous people,

and you just keep eating
your fucking cookie.

That joke came from
a real place â€“ I,

I was doing bills one night,
I was doing all the bills

and I did all the like, the household
bills, then I did my wife and I bills,

and then the kid bills, and there was
more kid bills than the adult bills.

And I got â€“ I went
to a bad place,

and I was walking through the house and I
walked past the living room where my kids were

and they werenâ€™t digging ditches
or putting an addition on the house

they were on the couch, wrapped in blankets,
eating the tray of cookies in front of them.

And I just stopped
and â€œLook at you.

Sitting there eating
your fucking cookies.â€

And then in my head went, â€œback out of the room,
you donâ€™t want to be in the news like this."

And I walk away.

Just little disease-filled skin
bags that want you to hug it.

Thatâ€™s all that they are.

People complain all the time â€œAh, I wasnâ€™t hugged
enough as a child, I had to go to therapy.â€

Hug you? Until you were 10 you
were a pathogen with legs, man.

Between 1 and 3 all of us were just war
crimes in plastic pants, thatâ€™s all we were.

Ahh, and I donâ€™t care
if you have kids or not.

Everybody in this room at one point has walked into
someone elseâ€™s house who has kids and said this sentence

â€œWhat is that smell?â€

And I donâ€™t mean the baby
smell when theyâ€™re little,

the talcum powdery,
thatâ€™s kinda cute.

I mean once they hit
the larvae stage.

And the first time it happened to
me, my son was 7

and youâ€™re not ready for it,
I didnâ€™t know what the Hell it was,

I walked in and went â€œOh, ahh, uh.
Honey, call State Farm!

We have toxic mold â€“ everyone get their masks
on, weâ€™re gonna be Japanese for a couple weeks!â€

Did you hear that pause?

That was that pause, you guys checked
to see if that joke was racist.

You went â€œHA...uhhh...heh."

Donâ€™t worry, I got this,
relax, I cleared it.

You know, whenever I see 12 Japanese
people in the airport with masks on,

I never think â€œThat is
so cute culturally.â€

I always think â€œWhat
the Hell do they know?â€

Iâ€™m gonna go down to the Rosetta Stone
kiosk and get some God damn answers.

So you walk into the house as
a parent and youâ€™re thinking,

â€œOk, what is that smell?
Oh, I know what that smell is â€“

that smell is one of the
tiny pets that disappeared.â€

Cuz when theyâ€™re little
you canâ€™t talk about death.

When a pet dies when theyâ€™re
little, itâ€™s like a mob hit.

â€œDaddy,
what happened to Mr. Pickles?â€

â€œMr.
Pickles got a job downstate.

Why you aksing so
many questions?

How â€˜bout you go in the other room and
eat your fuckinâ€™ cookie, how â€˜bout that?

How â€˜bout that, huh?â€

And then you walk into
the house and you go

â€œOK, I know what Iâ€™m looking for now, Iâ€™m looking for
a guinea pig corpse, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking for.â€

And after a while you think,
â€œThat smell is too big,

maybe someone left a tuna fish sandwich
in the vagina of a sperm whale, cuzâ€¦â€

Yeah, that oneâ€™s a little tart isnâ€™t it?
That one?

Itâ€™s one of those special
laughs â€œHahaha-thpthtpthpthptâ€

I have two children,
I have two children.

I have a uh, 12 year old boy
and a 14-year-old girl, uh,

so my house is the thunder
dome of stink right now.

It is a dueling piano bar of odor and they are trading
the title all the time, itâ€™s really interesting.

My daughter is also going through
the changeÂ which is just amazing.

Amazing, oh.

â€œHi Daddy.
Hahaha, herherher, arhaahaha.â€

â€œHoney, calm down,
I know what this is.

You are very pretty.

And here are some M&Mâ€™s.â€

Iâ€™m a good dad.

My son is 12,
which means he is Olympic-level dumb.

10 to 14-year-old boys,
man, I donâ€™t understand.

I thought he was on the
spectrum for a long time.

â€œWell, I guess we
just got to love him.â€

And then one day a bunch of his
friends came over and I'm like,

â€œOh, theyâ€™re ALL idiots!

Honey, weâ€™re ok,
heâ€™s just normal stupid, weâ€™re fine!â€

Stupidest group of
kids Iâ€™ve ever seen.

10 to 14-year-old boys man, if aliens
landed at my kidsâ€™ school and JUST

interviewed the 10 to 14-year-old
boys, they would vaporize the Earth.

I mean â€œNah, this species is going to die out on
its own, letâ€™s just end it here with these guys,

my God. Look at it. The socks donâ€™t match, theyâ€™re
wearing cargo shorts with long sleeve shirts.

Jesus, they think theyâ€™re funny and
theyâ€™re not and WHAT IS THAT SMELL?â€

I came downstairs on a
Saturday a while back

and my sonâ€™s sitting on the
couch watching television.

And he has on no pants.

I donâ€™t mean he has on
underwear and no pantsâ€¦

I mean, heâ€™s got a long t-shirt
on, and ABSOLUTELY NO PANTS.

And he was 11.
He knew about pants.

I go â€œWhat are you doing?â€

â€œIâ€™m watching cartoons.â€

â€œYou have no pants.â€

He looks me right
in the face and goes

â€œOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH.â€

Like it wasnâ€™t even in the
top 5 things bugginâ€™ himâ€¦

and thenâ€¦

HE GOES BACK TO
WATCHING TELEVISION.

To you people that
donâ€™t have kids

you think youâ€™ve been
angry in your life?

Thatâ€™s adorable.

That is soooo cute.

Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™ve never been
angry, Iâ€™m just sayingâ€¦

your normal, single,
non-kid anger is a 10 hereâ€¦

when you have a child, itâ€™s like adding a
four-inch layer of bitter frustration icingâ€¦

that smells like almonds
and tastes like aneurism.

And you canâ€™t do anything because theyâ€™re
little kids, you canâ€™tâ€¦ theyâ€™re little kids.

You canâ€™t knee â€˜em in the face
because the laws are different now.

My dad didnâ€™t have those laws,
thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not symmetrical.

And you, you just canâ€™t start screaming
because you lose all credibility,

so what I find myself doing
now, so nothing bad happens,

is I turn and I walk out of the room
having a mumble argument to myself.

â€œYou know, really, okâ€¦ wow.
HA HA HA.

You know what pants are. And youâ€™re
too young to have to air it out,

I donâ€™t know what
youâ€™re thinking.

And what makes you think itâ€™s ok to put your greasy
little boy-taint on my leather couch, my God?

I mean, Jesus Christ,

you left a racing stripe
the dogs wonâ€™t go near.â€

I donâ€™t think we have a homeless
problem in this Countryâ€¦

I think itâ€™s just parents roaming
the streets talking to themselves.

Trying to figure out what
the Hell their kid just did.

And thank God I have a spouse because
I can go find her. say to my wife

â€œDid you see whatâ€¦? Cuz thatâ€¦ Did you tell him it wasâ€¦
cuz I didnâ€™t...I donâ€™t even know what the fuckâ€¦ you know,

Iâ€™m gonna go for a walk.
I gotta go, I gotta go.â€

And then I find myself in front of my house
just walking down the street going like

â€œWhy would you put every piece of clothing
you own IN the washer at one time?

You heard the washer going
â€˜YEEAAOOOUUUWAAAAOOOUHâ€™

and you saw the smoke and the FLAMES
pouring out of the back of it,

after you filled it with DISH
SOAP, you little dumb-ass, my God.â€

And while Iâ€™m in front
of my house spaz-ranting,

someone slaps a
dollar in my handâ€¦

Iâ€™m gonna stay out
here and do THIS.

This is WAY easier
than raising a kid!

And I MADE money!

So I come back downstairs
after Iâ€™ve calmed down,

I go â€œGo get on some pants!â€

And hereâ€™s what pissed me off worse â€“
he got up like I did something wrong.

He got up like â€œOh, Dad lives in the
40â€™s where people gotta wear pants.â€

I go about my Saturdayâ€¦

I flick through some channels, I check some
emails, and blah blah blah, and I forget about him.

For 90 minutes.

Yeah, and THEN,
all of a sudden I realize,

I havenâ€™t heard a noise out of my
son in over an hour and a half.

Now, to you people without kids â€“
that sounds amazing, doesnâ€™t it?

â€œOh God, how great was that?â€

Noooooooo.

No. Until you have one,
you will not know the bone-chilling terror

of that first nano-second you
notice the death-like silence

of a free-range 11-year-old boy.

Itâ€™s like waking up on a flight,
and noticing the engines just quit.

And I start bolting through the
house, I get to his room,

I was like â€œDAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!â€

And you know when I found him?

I wish to God he was doing
something diabolical, evilâ€¦

building a bomb, worshiping Satan...
something.

Cuz at least then I know he was doing
something productive AAAAAAAAAND

heâ€™s gonna be the leader
of the prison gang.

â€œWhatâ€™s your son doing?â€
â€œHeâ€™s running Chino.â€

Thatâ€™s a conversation

that Iâ€™m willing to have with
somebody if thatâ€™s where it ends up.

INSTEAD, I look into my sonâ€™s room,
heâ€™s standing in the middle of the room

simply doing this â€“

â€œ â€

What the Hell is he doing?
â€œWhat are you doing?

What are you getting ready for an
early 20â€™s crystal meth addiction?

What is that?â€

I look down, still no pants.

But progress has been made.

And this happened.

My son is NOW,
wearing TWO pair of underwear.

I donâ€™t have a context
for that conversation.

I canâ€™t even sit down and
give him a Dad life lesson.

â€œI remember when I put on
two pair of underwearâ€¦â€

I â€“ I â€“ I just wentâ€¦

â€œYou get, what the fâ€”ahhh.

Wow. Donâ€™t you have nerve
endings in your ass?

You didnâ€™t notice that you
put underwear over underwear?

And just because you put
underwear over underwear

doesnâ€™t make the second
pair of underwear pants,

oh my God,

what does this special school cost??
Jesus.

I canâ€™t spell
Montessori, God Jesus.

AND WHAT IS THAT SMELL?!â€

That smell, I swear I wasnâ€™t
gonna be one of those parents.

Everyone has a friend who had
too many kids â€“ they regret it.

And when you go to their house, it
always smells like they are cooking eggs.

â€œWould you guys like to
eat out on the patio?â€

â€œPlease. Thank you.â€

And I wasnâ€™t gonna be that
â€“ they had just given up.

You could tell they
had just given up.

That their house is gonna smell like that
until everyone leaves and theyâ€¦ burn it down.

And I wasnâ€™t gonna
be that parent.

So the first time that it happened, I went
in his room and I went through everything.

I went through his drawers,
I went through his closet and â€œHa-HA!â€

I couldnâ€™t find the smell.

I WISH there was a 12-inch
human turd under his bed.

Cuz then I could go â€œVICTORY!
I HAVE FOUND THE SMELL!

Get the hazmat suits and the
bleach and then we shall dance!â€

Instead I just walked out

â€œWhyâ€¦ how does it soak into latex?
Itâ€™s impossible, oh my God.â€

If you have kids â€“ that smell â€“ if
you have boys especially â€“ UUGHH.

Girls have it too.
My daughter has a weird thing.

Her room looks great,
but you open her closet and itâ€™s like

HEHHHRRAGGHHH â€œOk, alright.

Your clothes have fumes, honey.
They shouldnâ€™t have fuuumes.â€

The smell is worse than a
hospital, or a nursing home,

or a, or a death camp.

Like, I could save some people from
Dachau, hide in my sonâ€™s room

â€œStay here,
the nazisâ€™ll never get you here!â€

And after about 10
minutes they would go

â€œYou know,
weâ€™re gonna go back to the camp.

Do you smell that? Uhhehh

Eckhhhh.
I think I need a shower. Eh.â€

No

No. No.

Nooo.

No.

Donâ€™t you â€œewâ€ that â€“ that
joke tracks perfectly.

I put â€˜em in my sonâ€™s room â€“
they smelt something horrible â€“

they felt disgusting â€“
they needed a shower.

But then YOU GUYS

added history.

Yeah. Thatâ€™s on you bitches.

As a matter of fact â€œOooooh.

OOOOOh. Yeah. Ohhhhh.

Yeah. Iâ€™m a little disappointed
in all of you, frankly.

Yeah, yeah. Howâ€™s that feel?â€

To you people that do not have
children, listen up,

cool Uncle Titus is gonna
help you out right now.

Between 1 and 18,
a childâ€™s gonna cost you roughly $300,000.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

Do you know what you
can get for $300,000?

A Lamborghini.

Do you know what you can
get with a Lamborghini?

Anything you want.

Are you kidding me, man?

You got a Lamborghini, park in front of
any restaurant or store in this town,

â€œPark it right here, sir. Weâ€™re
gonnawipe it down while youâ€™re inside.

Get that man a glass of champagne,
for he haaasss aaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!!â€

Pull up to a job interview
in a Lamborghini. Vvvrrroom.

â€œYouâ€™re obviously
management potential.

Please go talk to the boss,
weâ€™re gonna give you the corner office

because you have
aaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!"

Gentlemen, youâ€™re driving a
Lamborghini, who's sitting next to you?

Way-out-of-your-league-chick,
thatâ€™s whoâ€™s sitting next to you.

Smokinâ€™ body, she got
money, she got class,

she doesnâ€™t like you,
but you have aaaaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!!!

And youâ€™re living the
Lamborghini life, man.

VVvvvvrrrooomVVrrrrmmmmVvvvvrrrr.

Doing what you
want, when you want.

Stayinâ€™ up all night and gettingâ€™ up
early because youâ€™re not tired at all.

Thatâ€™s right. Because you know
what a Lamborghini doesnâ€™t have?

A FUCKING CAR SEAT.
THATâ€™S WHAT IT DOESNâ€™T HAVE.

THATâ€™S WHAT IT DOESNâ€™T HAVE.

Drivinâ€™ through town justâ€¦

VVvvvvrrrrrooomVVvvrrrrVrrrVrrrr.

Driving past parents in
mini-vans with bald tired because

â€œConnor needs bracesâ€

and theyâ€™re watching you drive by
like starving African children.

Flies buzzing around their headâ€¦

because WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

Because youâ€™re out there
living the Lamborghini life.

Doing crazy stuff. Taking vacations
that actually feel like vacations.

Ahhhh, youâ€™re staying in
the top floor of the resort,

in the kids-not-allowed suite â€“ Iâ€™ve
been there once, it was INCREDIBLE.

Out on the balcony with the one.

$60 bottle of pinot noir

â€œThis is an amazing life,
I love you, you love me.â€

And then 18 rooms down the hotelâ€¦
Waaaaay in the distance you hear

â€œGOD DAMMIT BRIAN,
STOP JUMPING ON THE BED!!!

WHO SAID YOU COULD
OPEN THE MINI BAR?

$32 CASHEWS?!
YOU KIDS ARE KILLING ME!â€

â€œThat is never gonna be us.â€

â€œLetâ€™s go in that room and
have some Lamborghini sex â€“

AAAAUUUUGGGhhhh

And you go in that room and
you take off your clothes and

you still look good 'cause you donâ€™t
have the stress-fat that kids give ya,

and you leave the door open because
NOBODYâ€™S GONNA WALK IN ON YA.

And you get out the ropes and
the chains and the lava lamp and

YOUâ€™RE DOINâ€™ IT LIKE YOU WANNA DO
IT, YEAH. YEAH.

Ride this more than 8 seconds!

WOOOOO!

YES!

Yes! Makinâ€™ noises
from Cro-Magnon times â€“

HERRRAAAAUAUUUGHHH!

BUTâ€¦

you drank too much and forgot
to be careful that night.

Now the Lamborghiniâ€™s
on Craigslist.

And youâ€™ve burned through that
Lamborghini money like THAT, you know why?

Because the kid has allergies and needs meds,
and a tutor, cuz heâ€™s missed so much school,

and you canâ€™t have a damn
PEANUT in your house ever again.

Yeaaaah. And now that amazing relationship you
had where you guys did EVERYTHING together,

now, youâ€™re still doing that, but now itâ€™s
gettingâ€™ fat and losinâ€™ your hair â€œWEEEEEEEEEE!â€

And youâ€™re going to sleep
before the nightclub opens.

And your friends that donâ€™t have
kids wonâ€™t come over anymore.

â€œYou guys wanna come
over for dinner?â€

â€œUH. NO. Weâ€¦

haftaâ€¦ go toâ€¦ Canada.â€

And you gotta take a job
you hate down at the Mill

cuz youâ€™re living in a
Bruce Springsteen song now.

And not the first verse,
the third verse, where it gets weird.

And every morning,
you leave at 4 a.m.

you leave for work with
your tiny little lunch box,

but you always glance back at the electric
guitar you bought right before she got pregnant.

Behind that, fading into the wallpaper with
the rest of your crushed hopes and dreams.

And nowâ€¦ you gotta start
hanging out with other parents.

Ahhhhhhh.

The most unreasonable
group of delusional humps

I have ever met in my life.

Some of you are in here tonight. Thatâ€™s why
that joke got a little bit of subdued laugh.

â€œIâ€™m not delusional.â€
Yeah, you are, holy shit.

And youâ€™re out there with
them, you know.

Theyâ€™ve also balled up
their hopes and dreams.

Instead of tossing them away like you
did, they took their hopes and dreams

and started RAMMINâ€™ THEM DOWN
THEIR KIDSâ€™ THROATS, YEAH.

â€œYouâ€™re going to soccer camp
three times a year because

DADDY DIDNâ€™T GET
TO PLAY IN COLLEGE!

Ha Ha Ha Ha.â€

And youâ€™re out there with â€˜em.

You know,
your kids on the team too,

and you LOOOOOVE gettinâ€™ up at 7 a.m.
on a Saturday WEEEEEEE!

And Iâ€™m just out there â€“ â€œGod,
pleaseâ€¦ I hope somebody breaks a tibia.â€

I donâ€™t even care if itâ€™s my kid because then
we wonâ€™t have to come back next Saturday.

And while youâ€™re standing there,
praying for it to be over, that one dude

â€œYou see my little Brian out there?
Heâ€™s amazing, you see my Brian?

Heâ€™s badassâ€¦ BADASSSSS!!

Kidsâ€™ gonna be in
the world cup.â€

â€œThe kid that just ran full-speed
into the goal post? That kid?â€

â€œYeah, he always gives 110
percent â€“ 110 PERCEEEEENNNT!!â€

â€œHey, did you guys see my little Stanley?
Heâ€™s a badass, gonna play in the NFL.â€

â€œHahahaha.
Stanley weighs like 17 pounds.â€

â€œHey hey hey hey,
Stanleyâ€™s life coach said â€“

donâ€™t talk about
Stanleyâ€™s weight.â€

â€œOh my God, did you see my
little Tanyaâ€™s test scores?

She is amazing.
Oh my God, Tanya, oh my God.

That little girl is
gonna work for NASA.â€

â€œNobodyâ€™s gonna tell her?

Uhâ€¦ N-No,
sheâ€™s not gonna work for NASA.

Weâ€™ve all known Tanya for
about four years now and, and,

weâ€™re pretty sureâ€¦ Tanyaâ€™s gonna
leave a baby in a dumpster.

Cuz you guys have dressed her like
a tiny hooker since she was two.

And my kids canâ€™t stop watching her
because heâ€™s obviously a FOLLOWER.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE
GAME, IDIOT!â€

And you do your best, parents. Everyone,
every parent in this room is doing their best.

And if you get â€˜em to 18, yes!
You get to kick â€˜em out!

And you never have
to see â€˜em again!

Hahahaha.

Hahahahaaahahahahahaa.

Iâ€™m sorry,
I couldnâ€™t stop laughing.

Yeah, they go away
for a little while.

But then at 19 and a half you get a phone
call from the local police department.

â€œMr. Titus,
weâ€™ve arrested your sonâ€¦

and his girlfriend Tanyaâ€¦

for drug trafficking.â€

â€œWHAT?â€ You go to the jail â€“

â€œDrug trafficking?
What the Hell were you doing, idiot?â€

â€œUH, me and Tanya went to Mexico,
and she met this guy with a backpack

and .â€

And Iâ€™m at the front desk filling
out paperwork, bailing him out,

the cop goes â€œWe know
your sonâ€™s an idiot.

He didnâ€™t do anything wrong. He helped
us catch the drug dealer, though,

we caught the drug dealer cuz of h-
yeah, we impounded his car,

you should check it out.â€ And
you glance at an impound and

THEREâ€™S YOUR LAMBORGHINI
FROM TWENTY YEARS AGO.

And the cop goes â€œThat thingâ€™s
like 20 years old, itâ€™s a classic,

itâ€™s worth like 1.2
million dollars now.â€

"Um...

where do you guys
keep the extra guns?

And can I talk to my
kid one more time?

Cuz I love him so much.â€

Now, granted,
thatâ€™s worse-case-scenario. BUT,

I have two, I have two children.

I stopped at two children,

because my ex-wifeâ€™s
vagina was busy elsewhere.

It had a guest list and I wasnâ€™t on it.
There ya go.

You can â€˜Oohâ€™ that joke all you want but
I could say a lot meaner s tuff than that.

Instead I chose to use
the Kingâ€™s English.

â€œHER VAGINA WAS BUSY ELSEWHERE.

HER WIZARD SLEEVE WAS FILLED WITH
THE WANDS OF OTHER SORCERERS.â€

When I call someone a cheating
bitch, I do it classy!

Be careful who you marry, people.
Make good choices.

When you get married,
make REALLY REALLY good choices.

You know. You know something
else weird about that?

I found out she was cheating on me.
I found out on a Friday.

I was in court by Tuesday.

Because Iâ€™m a knee-jerk person.
I just, I filed for divorce instantly.

I just react. Cuz my dad had a
good jab and you had to move.

And I went to court that Tuesday. It was
like, literally four or five days later

â€œI WANT A DIVORCE!â€ Cuz my
â€“ the switch got flipped.

You know in a relationship,
switch flip, â€œI want a divorce!â€

And this woman stood
up, IN COURT, and said

â€œYour honor, this manâ€™s been
beating me for twenty years

and beating the children
since the day they were born.â€

Now,
letâ€™s deal with the first one.

If YOUUUUU let me BEAT YOU

for TWENTY YEARS,

THATâ€™S not abuse.

Thatâ€™s a fetish.

But then she lied again and
said I beat my children.

So I spent every dime I ever
made on my fine television show

and I spent every dime Iâ€™ve
made in comedy for six years,

and I PROVED after six years
that it NEVER happened.

But, to this day, like 9 years
later, sheâ€™ll be like

â€œCan I have the kids an extra day,
Iâ€™ll bring them home on time.â€

Iâ€™m like â€œNo you wonâ€™t,
you cheating liar.â€ And she always goes

â€œOh my God,
are you still talking about THAT?

That is in the past,
when are you gonna let that go?â€

My answer always is

â€œWhen the Jews let it go.â€

Itâ€™s gonna be a minute.

Be careful who you
marry, be careful!

Be careful!
Pick well, pick well!

Donâ€™t get married FAST.
People get married so fast, too.

â€œOh, we knew each other 18 months,
we got married, itâ€™s gonna be great.â€

â€œDid you really risk THAT MUCH? Did you go to
Vegas, put everything on Red, too? Did you?

Wow. Did you fly Southwest to Vegas
and just REALLY risk it all, did ya?

When you landed, did you eat at Chipotle burrito?
Just fucking go for it, if youâ€™re gonna liveâ€¦â€

You canâ€™t know somebody after 2 years!
In two years?

You canâ€™t know anybody
after two years.

You know why? Your brain for the
first 2 years of a relationship,

is producing a chemical thatâ€™s like
heroine. Thatâ€™s why you feel like that.

Look at your behavior when you first
meet somebody and fall in love.

What do you do? You go out and you
get cheeseburgers. You come back,

you have sex for 4 hours,
then you go out and get frozen yogurt.

Then you go back and have sex for 4
hours, then you call into work

while youâ€™re still
inside somebody,

then you go out and
have cheeseburgers again

â€“ THATâ€™S CRACKHEAD BEHAVIOR
â€“ THATâ€™S WHAT THAT IS.

But nobody tells you that.
No one tells you â€“

â€œOh, itâ€™s gonna be
great, you know.â€

Cuz once youâ€™re married, that heroine
feeling doesnâ€™t last all day anymore.

At most â€“ AT MOST â€“ you
get 15 minutes a day.

And you spend 23 hours and 45
minutes trying to get the next fix.

Why do you think
flower shops exist?

Itâ€™s expensive dead plants.

â€œHere you go,
baby.â€ â€œOh my God.â€ â€œYEEEAAAAAAH.â€

Gentlemen â€“ every woman in this room knows
that fishnet stockings keep nobody warm.

â€œYEAH THEY DO.â€

It takes eight years
to know somebody.

And I know a lot of us are thinking â€“ â€œWow,
I canâ€™t hold the crazy back that long.â€

But you have to â€“ you have to.

Because two-year-relationship-you,
is not eight-year-relationship-you

Two-year-relationship-you isâ€¦

gentlemen, youâ€™re in the car with her â€“ two-year-relationship-you,
get cut off by a psychopath, what do you do?

â€œOh my God,
look at this silly son of a bitch.

How goofy is that, right? Wow. Letâ€™s
go to Dairy Queen and get a blizzard.â€

Eight-year-relationship-you,
same guy cuts you off,"

â€œMOTHERFUCKâ€”GET ME MY
SHOTGUN, RIGHT NOW!!â€

CHHHH-CHHHH.

â€œOh my God.â€

â€œWhat are you doing?!â€

â€œTexting my mom
about the wedding.

No, weâ€™re still gonna get married, Iâ€™m
just gonna go with a Kevlar theme, now.â€

Ladies, what are you laughing about?
Two-year-relationship-you?

We LOOOOOOOVE two-year-
relationship-you.

Two-year-relationship-you
is amazing.

â€œYou going to Vegas with your buddies?
Well, just go have a good time.

Donâ€™t even take your phone â€“ what
happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,

I donâ€™t careâ€¦

Go, just go!â€

â€œI love you,
you love meee yaaa.â€

Eight-year-relationship-you â€“

â€œWhere WERE you?â€

â€œYou sent me to Rite Aid.â€

â€œ27 minutes ago.

And I said the ones
without wingsâ€¦â€

Pick well, man, pick well.

You know itâ€™s funny, your parents want,
everyone wants you to get married.

Everybody wants you to get married.
Thatâ€™s why people rush into it â€“

because you were pushing â€˜em.

â€œOh my God, are you going to make
my daughter and honest woman?â€

â€œNo, I prefer the untrustworthy
whore I have now, thank you.â€

â€œYouâ€™re gonna make
my son a real man?â€

â€œWhy? You worried about
the yoga pants too?â€

If a mother SEES you
getting along with somebody

â€œOh my God, you guys are so cute! Theyâ€™re
gonna get married! Take the journeyâ€¦

OH MY GOD TAKE THE JOURNEEEEY!â€

They never say â€œItâ€™s
a fun journeyâ€¦â€

And like all journeys you
should strap your ass in.

Because if marriage is a journey,
divorce is a plane crash.

And if you have kids,
it lasts 'til theyâ€™re 18 years old.

To you people in here tonight that
got divorced, but never had kids.

I want you to know something
â€“ you didnâ€™t get divorced.

You had a long-term booty-call with
paperwork, thatâ€™s all that was.

Yeah, thatâ€™s all it was. Sorry.

Was it hard on ya? To split up the CDâ€™s?
Was that a bitch for you? Was it?

â€œOh my God, whoâ€™s going to get the Matrix
boxset? We need to hire an arbitrator.â€

It is NOT a real divorce until
you shred the chi of an innocent.

â€œMommy said my chi used to be
aqua, but daddy made it charcoal.

He lives with my first
grade teacher now.â€

Thatâ€™s a divorce right there.
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Iâ€™ve gotten to a very
sick place with comedy.

Iâ€™ve done this so long now â€“ this is my
seventh special â€“ I want you to know something.

So, I WANT you guys to laugh.

And Iâ€™m used to that â€“ Iâ€™ve
been doing that a long time.

Now Iâ€™ve got to
this weird place,

like a guy whoâ€™s had way to much
sex where I need it a little weird,

so I write a joke
where, when you guys go

â€œHa ha haâ€¦ Aaaahhhâ€¦ Oooooh."

Hhhrrr.

Itâ€™s not good â€“ itâ€™s not good.
I have a problem, itâ€™s not good.

Cuz a lot of people do
that to a lot of peopleâ€¦

like a lot of people like, ahh,

â€œOh my God, I donâ€™t like you,
we got married too fast, letâ€™s have a kid

so we can slowly destroy
the soul of a child.â€

You think a child is going
to fix your relationship?

Youâ€™re just strip mining three souls
now, good job, man.

Cuz, by the way, when you have
kids, that heroine thing, like

â€œDid you cut this with children?

I donâ€™t feel anything at all.

Iâ€™m tired,
but thatâ€™s all I got."

Cuz once you have a
kid, that is for real.

People donâ€™t understand that. People pop
out a kid thinking itâ€™s gonna be fine...

Oh my God. No, man.
If you have a kid, thatâ€™s for real.

Once you have a child,
hereâ€™s the deal.

You now OWN a human being.

Look at it.

And it does THAT A LOT.

You have now basically created
a totalitarian government

in your own home and that
little fucker is Stalin

It wants what it wants.

It wants it NOW.

And you better be movinâ€™.

And then what it does
is also your fault.

And thereâ€™s no receipt,
you canâ€™t take it back.

And you have one job
as a parent â€“ ONE JOB â€“

donâ€™t raise
douchebags, thatâ€™s it.

Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all there is.
You donâ€™t raise douchebags.

If at the end of
18 years your kid

can cook a meal, pay a bill and wipe
his own ass, GOD BLESS YOU, PEOPLE.

Thatâ€™s all you need.
Canâ€™t do anything anyway.

Iâ€™m watching my daughterâ€¦

I canâ€™t tell my daughter â€œYouâ€™re
gonna do thisâ€¦ Youâ€™re gonnaâ€¦â€

Sheâ€™s going off on her own,
sheâ€™s gonna do what sheâ€™s gonna do.

Donâ€™t raise douchebags,
because you donâ€™t want to be the parent

that gets interviewed
after the verdict.

â€œYeah, I donâ€™t know,
I just thought he liked trench coats. Uh.

No, I read his journals,
I thought they were song lyrics.â€

Donâ€™t raise douchebags â€“ so you
donâ€™t know how hard it is â€“ again,

cool Uncle Titus is gonna help you
people that donâ€™t have kids yet â€“

from the second theyâ€™re born,
the second theyâ€™re born â€“

all youâ€™re doing â€“ from
the second theyâ€™re born â€“

is downloading life programs
into tiny retarded people.

Theyâ€™re not on the same
operating system youâ€™re onâ€¦

their download speed sucks assâ€¦

and thereâ€™s a ton
of error messages.

From the second,
the SECOND theyâ€™re born â€“

go to sleep when we tell ya,
take the nipple when youâ€™re supposed to,

coffee tables hurt when you
run into them full speed.

Stitches hurt going
in AND coming out.

Then they get older â€“ do your homework.
Error. Do your homework. Error.

Quit lying. Error. Error.
Error. Error. Error.

Wipe your ass! WIPE YOUR ASS!
WIPE YOUR ASS!!!

Yeah, and that wipe your
ass download as a parent,

as a man youâ€™re gonna be getting
upgrades on that one your whole life.

As a MAN, your last wipe your ass upgrade
will be given to you by your NEW WIFE

while youâ€™re standing
in the laundry room

I like that joke cuz it
humiliates everybody.

You see a couple justâ€¦

And thatâ€™s all youâ€™re doing,
just downloading programs,

constantly,
constantly, constantly.

And the only thing I really enjoyed about having
kids, I really enjoyed for the first 10 years

was, for the first 10 years,
I was the smartest person they knew,

and thatâ€™s never happened
in my whole life.

Like, I had an answer,
I knew everything they wanted.

Two little beings had to
ask me â€“ I had an answer.

Even if I was wrong,
they had to believe me

because I control the
food and the shelter.

â€œYou donâ€™t think Iâ€™m right? How â€˜bout
you go stand outside and figure it out?

How â€˜bout that?

Leave the jacket,
I paid for that.â€

For 10 years I knew everything!

I was a genius!
I also got to run them.

If I had a bad day, I could

â€œDo what I tell you to do because
Iâ€™m your father, blah blah blah.â€

I had to run them,
I was the dictator of the house.

I got to be the
Hitler of my own home.

And I gotta be honest â€“
sometimes kinda fun to be Hitler!

Only me and Hitler
have ever said that.

But you were â€“ you get to be,
as dads, you get to be Hitler.

â€œClean your room!
Go to bed when I tell you!

Empty the dishwasher!
Invade Poland!

Letâ€™s Do This!â€

And if theyâ€™re really bad â€“ you
get to lock them in their room

like Hitler did
for a little while.

â€œYou vill stay in zere.

Und you vill give me ze
information I am requesting.

Und you vill stop LYING.

Und if you do zat,
und tell me ze truthâ€¦

maybe UND ONLY MAYBEâ€¦

you can have a fucking cookie.â€

Yeah. Pretty scary voice coming
out of this mug, isnâ€™t it?

â€œHe does that really well.â€

And then they get older,
thatâ€™s the problem.

When they get older, they start asking
you for upgrades that you donâ€™t have.

And thatâ€™s what I didnâ€™t like at all.
10, 11, 12, 13â€¦

my son started about 10, weâ€™re
driving home one day and he just goes

â€œHey dad, how do rockets work?â€

â€œYou know Iâ€™m going to San Diego
to tell jokes about you, right?

Thatâ€™s what I do.

Iâ€™m not taking a rocket.

Google it.
It has two Kâ€™s thatâ€™s all I know.â€

Shut up.
I know it doesnâ€™t have to Kâ€™sâ€¦

And my daughter tooootally
screwed me up bad.

Man, just when I stopped letting
them ask me questions anymore,

I was like â€œWeâ€™re done talking.â€

We were home one night,
she was 13 at the time, it was last year,

and we were watching â€“
the TV was on and uh,

and I have a podcast and we
talk about the world a lot

and so I watch a lot of news and I want
to see whatâ€™s going on in the world.

And weâ€™re watching it and
weâ€™re sitting there and uh,

the Ferguson thing was
on, you knowâ€¦

oh, sorry, no, sorry, it was the Baltimore
thing, the Baltimore thing was on.

Wait â€“ soâ€¦ noâ€¦

it was the North Carolina
thing where that guy got

â€“ noâ€¦ sorry, sorry,

it was the New Jersey
thing where theyâ€¦ No?

Sorry,
it was the Florida â€“ wait.

No, it was the Louisianaâ€¦ no,
that was this week. Uhhhm.

All I remember is some black people were getting
soul-raped by bullets â€“ thatâ€™s all I remember.

Yeah â€“ this bitâ€™s going
to be uncomfortable.

And Iâ€™m making â€˜em watch the news,
Iâ€™m just making them watch it, you know.

And they wanna watch Spongebob
because theyâ€™re so civic-minded.

Iâ€™m like going â€œShut up, weâ€™re watching
this. Stop it, weâ€™re watching this.â€

Cuz I believe you need scars to
survive this world, you know?

You parents that are
raising shiny kids

â€œOh my God we block his internet if it has
the word â€˜sexâ€™ in it he canâ€™t access itâ€¦

even if itâ€™s got an s we donâ€™t
let him get to that, Ugh.

Heâ€™s got two channels: heâ€™s
got PBS and PBS Latino.

UNO DOS TRES! Ohhhh,

he loves Burt and Ernesto.â€

So, yeah.
And by the way, those kids?

Those kids youâ€™re raising?
Theyâ€™re gonna be shiny.

Theyâ€™re gonna be great kids.

High self-esteem,
not afraid of anything,

prolly get scholarships to
Ivy League Universities.

And then at 18 youâ€™re going to
send them off into the world â€“

and theyâ€™re gonna get hit by a
bus because you didnâ€™t teach them

THE WORLD IS DANGEROUS.

You need scars! You need scars!

Scare â€˜em, a little bit!

My dad did not have a
child-worship thing AT ALL.

I went where he went and I
better shut the Hell up about it.

When I was six years old,
he took me with his date

to a drive-in movie theater to see
a Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movie

called Magnum Force.

YEAH.
I was wearing FEETIE PAJAMAS!

And in the first three minutes of
this movie, a dude in a cop uniform,

a guy Iâ€™ve been taught
to trust my whole life,

kicks in a door and
shoots two people

having naked bushy 70â€™s sexâ€¦

the dude falls off the bed.

The woman turns - full-boob-shot.
I went through puberty at SIX!!

Then, he shoots her in the boob.

So now I gotta buy weird
magazines the rest of my life.

THEN, then she falls out a window
and bleeds out into a pool.

I went into that movie six years
old, I came out SMOKING.

â€œYeah, that was a nice piece of
cinema, daddy. I enjoyed that a lot.

I do have to say, that although Clint
Eastwoodâ€™s anti-hero is violent,

itâ€™s just a
reflection of society.

Now Iâ€™d like to go home and burn my
Dr. Seuss books because there is no God.â€

Iâ€™m gonna be seven in a couple
months, I was done with whimsy anyway.

Not the worse one.

My mom was mentally ill, in and out
of mental institutions my whole life.

So between the ages of when I was
8 and 12 she was out for a while.

At 9 years old, we go to the drive-in
movie theater, just me and my mom,

and we see a movie called One
Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest.

Yeahâ€¦ yeah. I think for mom it
was a research trip of some sort.

And Iâ€™m just a kid watching a movie.
Iâ€™m just sitting there watching the movie

and itâ€™s the scene where
Nicholsonâ€™s getting shock treatment

â€“ and I look over â€“
my mom is sobbing.

And I go â€œMom,
whatâ€™s the matter?â€ And she goes

â€œThatâ€™s what they did to me.â€

â€œDid you get to meet
Jack Nicholson?â€

So weâ€™re watching
the Ferguson thing

and itâ€™s going off, man,
itâ€™s just going off and eh

people are screaming and
burn - buildings are burning,

cops are shooting bullets at
people, it was crazy,

and then â€“ weâ€™re watching it.

And I FEEL like Iâ€™m doing
the right thing as a parent.

I feel like, you know what?
Theyâ€™re seeing the world as it is, good.

They need to see it so they know
what the worldâ€™s like. Alright, good.

And Iâ€™m just sittinâ€™ there, not thinking
anything, and my daughter looks up and goes

â€œDad?

Why are black people so angry?â€

â€œWhat channel is Spongebob on?â€

Cuz it should be illegal
to ask me that question!

Do you see what color that is?

You can only find that
at a napkin factory.

I wanted to turn
to my kids and go

â€œGuys, we canâ€™t talk about
this, weâ€™re almost clear.â€

But I donâ€™t want to be that
parent, man.

I donâ€™t want to pull the ripcord.
So many parents just pull the ripcord.

You know â€“ it's
like-especially now

â€œOh, mommyâ€™s going to take a Xanax, you guys
go play video games, we canâ€™t talk about thisâ€¦â€

Or that other show,
manâ€¦ Beyond Scared Straight.

What a crap-show that is. You know
what pissed me off about that show?

Every parent is the
victim in that show.

â€œJustin was going to school and
he wasnâ€™t doing what he said,

and he was getting Fâ€™s and Dâ€™s and he was
selling drugs and he was beating up people,

and he was just horrible,
so I think the best course of action

is to send him to a
maximum security prison so

rapists and murderers can teach him
because I suck that bad as a parent.â€

Listen, if your kid ended up
on Beyond Scared Straightâ€“

you fucked up.

And you have no excuse because
there are sporting goods stores

ALLLL over the place and
theyâ€™re full of baseball bats.

As my dad said,
â€œSometimes respect comes from Louisville.â€

That jokeâ€™s gonna be in court
with my ex-wife, trust me.

So I donâ€™t know what to
say, man.

Iâ€™m like - and I donâ€™t want to be
that parent. I want to do my best,

so she asked me, and sheâ€™s looking at
me, and the riots going onâ€¦

and Iâ€™m just like, I like, I,
uhm, Iâ€™m gonna Chuck Yeager this,

â€œAlright honey, alright â€“

why are black people angry? Well, let me
tell you â€“ black people are angry becauseâ€¦

bla... bla... black people
â€“ black â€“ black people.

Theyâ€™re An-Anâ€”Angry.

Because of people like your father,
letâ€™s just be honest, becauseâ€¦

because this exact face has been the face
of the white devil for 500 years now.

I guarantee you, honey, you could
open a history book and find this face

on a Sepia-toned garret-type

of a guy standing in front of a
cotton field being photobombed by

three guys hanging from an oak
tree, Iâ€™m pretty sure.â€

Yeah, yeahâ€¦ read a history
book, it sucks.

But thenâ€¦ and then she
asked me about slavery.

But she doesnâ€™t ask about the history
of slavery, I got thatâ€¦ she goes

â€œDad, can you explain to
me the concept of slavery?â€

Like, Spongebob is one channel
away, right there, one button.

I mean, ask me something thatâ€™s easy to
talk about thatâ€™s not gonna freak me out

â€“ butt sex, Iâ€™ll tell you about that if
you all go â€“ something horrible, really?

â€œAlright, the concept of slavery.
Ok, oh God,

ahh K, hereâ€™s the CONCEPT
of slaveryâ€¦ Uhhhhh, huhâ€¦

This person whoâ€™s black, because
their skin has too much melanin in itâ€¦

and this person whoâ€™s white, who if they go
outside for 40 minutes turns into a pot-pieâ€¦

thatâ€™s the differenceâ€¦
and because of that,

this person gets
to OWN this person.

And THIS person has to do
everything this person says,

because if they donâ€™t,
the job benefits include

whipping,
raping and selling off your family,

which is the worst High
School job fair ever.

I wouldnâ€™t even fill
out that application.

Unless it was good health care.â€

And I getâ€”sheâ€™s just as
uncomfortable as you guys are â€“

and I get up and I go â€œAnd
Lincoln freed the slaves!â€

And she goes â€œSo it was
all cool after that.â€

â€œYeah, kinda like Israel
and Palestine is all cool.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s going on in
Israel and Palestine?â€

â€œCAN WE JUST WATCH
SPONGEBOB, PLEASE?!â€

And I realized â€“

and you do this as a parent
sometimes â€“ you realize -

â€œOh,
Iâ€™m digging a hole right now.â€

Iâ€™ve driven it back a way, and Iâ€™m just
digging a hole of stupidity right now.

And I know if I keep talking Iâ€™m going to sitting
across from her Principal in a couple of weeks,

â€œMr. Titus, did you have a long talk with
your daughter about black people and slavery?

Cuz there was a
riot on Thursdayâ€¦

and your daughter organized it.â€

â€œNO SHE DID NOT.
What side was she?

She wasnâ€™t doing this, was she?â€

â€œNo, noâ€¦ we have one of her
picket signs right here â€“ it says

â€˜Weâ€™re all pink on the inside like Salmonâ€™.
Did you tell her that?â€

Ehâ€¦ I pulled the rip cord
pretty much on that one, yeah.

So I did something creepy to my daughter
in the middle of this conversation

that my dad used to do
to me whenever I asked

my dad something that he didnâ€™t
want to talk about, he would just go

â€œWHY THE HELL DO
YOU WANNA KNOW?â€

And I was so scared
of my dad I would like

â€œI donâ€™t. Iâ€™m good.
I donâ€™t need to know anything, Iâ€™m fine.

Iâ€™m prolly gonna be a
standup comedian anyway,

Iâ€™m just gonna go over here,

learn to hit on waitresses and write some
fart jokes, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m gonna do now.â€

But I didnâ€™t raise my daughter like
that, but I did it, I go

â€œWhy do you wanna know?â€

And she looked scared
of me and she goes â€œOh,

I wanna understand the
black kid at my school.â€

â€œTHE black kid?

You have ONE black kid at
your little private school?â€

She goes â€œYeah, her nameâ€™s Sarah,
sheâ€™s in 6th grade, sheâ€™s pretty cool,

I wanna understand what
her people went through.â€

â€œUh, well, I can tell you
why black people are angryâ€¦

because we have ONE black kid
at your little private school.

Yeah,
thatâ€™s probably in the top 5.â€

And I realize Iâ€™m not
getting out of this, man.

And I gotta do it. And sometimes
as a parent you just gotta dive in.

I was like â€œAlright, hon.

Alright, imagine this,
imagine living in your own country,

everybodyâ€™s the same.

And a bunch of boats show up,

and a bunch of people who are a,
photo negative of you, get out.â€

I did my best.

â€œAnd you waive to them from the
shore, and they shoot a bunch of you.

And then they put you in a boat and take
you THOUSANDS of miles across the ocean.

And you werenâ€™t riding
on the lead-oak deck.

There was no shuffleboard
on the Amistad.

Now youâ€™re in another country youâ€™ve
never been to for hundreds of years.

And youâ€™re slaves for hundreds
and hundreds of years.

And then one day you were freed.

But you werenâ€™t freed because people
had â€˜insightâ€™ to the human condition.

You werenâ€™t freed
because someone said

â€˜My Land, Mary-Beth,
I woke up on the plantation this morninâ€™

and I-I just realized that one
man should not own another.

You-you tell Rastis and Jolene
to meet me in the kitchen,

Iâ€™m gonna write them a check and make
them some chocolate chip waffles!â€™

Sadly, honey, slavery did not
end with chocolate chip waffles.

In fact, some people
wanted their slaves SO BAD

they were willing to die for them, go
to war, almost split the country in two.

You know, and then once they were
freed, they never got paid.â€

And my daughter just goes
â€œWhaâ€” they NEVER got paid?â€

I said, â€œNo. They were promised
to get paid, but they never did.â€

And my daughter, who was raised
in way too much privilege says,

â€œWell, why didnâ€™t they hire a lawyer
and file a class action suit?â€

Wow, one semester at Compton Junior
High wouldâ€™ve taken care of all of this.

I said â€œThey couldnâ€™t file
with attorneys because

had to follow the slave
laws.â€ And my daughter goes,

â€œDad, you said they were freed.
There was no slave laws.â€

â€œI know, they had these things called
â€˜Slave Lawsâ€™ and then when they got freed,

they didnâ€™t change the
laws, they changed the name,

to â€˜Black Lawsâ€™â€

â€“ itâ€™s like now,
when you say â€˜WARMONGERâ€™

â€“ you mean Republican.

AND, when you say
â€˜DEMOCRATâ€™ you mean pussy.

See that?

See how I lost you all
and then got you all back?

And she says, she asks, she goes

â€œWell after those laws went away, it was
all, it was all, it was all cool, right?â€

â€œYeah, after those laws went away,
things got a lot better, you know?

I mean, except for the hard
stuff, like, you knowâ€¦

drinking out of the
same water fountain, orâ€¦

riding in the front of a
bus, orâ€¦

using a toilet that a
white butt had touched, orâ€¦

eating at a restaurant
with all white peopleâ€¦

playing sports with
white peopleâ€¦ marrying â€“

Oh my God itâ€™s never gonna get
better, is it?â€

And my daughter sees me
flailing, I got nowhere to go.

Itâ€™s not better.
As we saw, as whatâ€™s happening right now,

and, and I start to flail,
and my daughter saves my ass.

My kid, I love my
kids, she just goes

â€œBut Martin Luther
King made it better!â€

And I go â€œYESSSSS!!

YESS! YES!

MARTIN LUTHER KING!
HE DID MAKE IT BETTER!

HE WAS AN AMAZING LEADER!

And we marched together!
And we knew we were all the same, yes,

Martin Luther King was
incredible!â€ And she goes,

â€œWhat happened to
Martin Luther King?â€

God Dammit.

"He was assassinated
by a white guyâ€¦ uhhhâ€¦â€

My little girl â€“ who never
heard it like this â€“ itâ€™s weird.

We spent an hour and a half talking
and I â€“ I pay for her school,

she should know ALL of this

but I guess the
school I sent her to â€“

all the textbooks
were written in Texas.

I mean, cuz all I can imagine
it says is 'slavery was bad.

Lincoln freed the slaves.

Good job, white guy!â€

And she goes,
â€œIs that how it really went down?â€

â€œPretty much, babe.
The best I could tell ya.â€

She goes, â€œOh my God,
dad, thatâ€™s horrible.â€

And my little girl,

starts to cryâ€¦ sheâ€™s never
heard it like this before.

Yeah.
And I go, â€œItâ€™s ok, honey.â€

And she goes, â€œNo,
itâ€™s not ok, dad.

Itâ€™s not ok at all.
If thatâ€™s how black peopleâ€¦

were treated for 500 yearsâ€¦

thatâ€™s horrible.

That means that one dayâ€¦

theyâ€™re gonna kill us!â€

â€œUm, did they teach you what we did to the
Indians in your little private school, there?â€

â€œNO! WHAT DID WE DO
TO THE INDIANS?!â€

â€œWe had Thanksgiving
dinner with themâ€¦

and then we cleaned up
the dishes togetherâ€¦

and then the Indians
dealt blackjack.â€

And I pulled the ripcord
HARD, man.

Best Spongebob marathon I
have ever seen in my life!

Told you it was gonna
get uncomfortable.

I didnâ€™t write this show to make
fun of your kids or my kids,

I wrote this show to
make fun of all of us.

Because everybody in this
room, right now,

was one of these little
douchebags Iâ€™m talking about.

At one point you were,
so Iâ€™m gonna give you a gift tonight,

that I canâ€™t use anymore because
both my parents are gone.

But if your parents are still around
tomorrow morning, I want you to get up,

and I want you to call them.

And say â€œHey mom, hey
dad, how you guys doing?

By the way,
did you need help with anything?â€

Now, theyâ€™re gonna
say, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?

How much money do you need?â€

That was really giving
up too much honesty, bro.

And I want you to say, â€œNo, Iâ€™m good, actually I called
because I want to ask you something, mom and dad.

I want you to tell me the story of the worst,
stupidest thing I ever did when I was a kid.â€

Or, you can tell them something
they donâ€™t know that you did.

Thatâ€™s what I thought.

And then youâ€™re gonna let them
talk, and youâ€™re gonna listen.

Because we stopped listening
to our parents at one point.

Listen to them. You know.

Cuz if I could, I would LOVE to listen
my parents, and I canâ€™t anymore.

And listen to them. Let them tell the
story of the stupidest thing you did.

Itâ€™ll surprise you.

Cuz youâ€™ll think something that
wasnâ€™t that bad is HORRIBLE to them.

And, and if theyâ€™re laughing while
theyâ€™re telling you that story,

you get to laugh with them.

If theyâ€™re still pissed â€“

you shut up. No excuses.

And you let â€˜em talk.

And then when theyâ€™re done I
want you to apologize to them.

Because no matter what
you think of your parents.

No matter how good or
bad they raised you.

If they didnâ€™t send
you to college.

If they were abusive.
If they were alcoholics.

It doesnâ€™t matter.

Because at the end of the
day, your parents

gave you the greatest gift.

They gave you LIIIIFE.

And you â€“ RUINED theirs.

RUINED it.

I know you donâ€™t believe
that, but itâ€™s fuckinâ€™ true.

They had dreams,
and then you were born,

and thatâ€™s all they had.

Dreams.

Well, thank you little bastardâ€¦

â€œWAAAA!â€

I didnâ€™t get it.
I didnâ€™t get it until becoming a parent.

You know why?
If youâ€™ve seen my comedy, in the past,

I have not been very
nice to my father.

I have said some horrible â€“

I have basically said
my father was abusive.

But I have now had kidsâ€¦

and theyâ€™re both over 10
years oldâ€¦ and I realizedâ€¦

my father wasnâ€™t abusiveâ€¦

he was trying not to murder me.

If youâ€™re abusive,
youâ€™re kicking someone down the stairs,

youâ€™re punchinâ€™ â€˜em,
youâ€™re burning them with a cigarette.

My dad didnâ€™t do that.
Even when I did something stupid,

he would just come
over to me and just go,

â€œAHHHH!! MOTHER-OH MY GOD

YOU MOTHERFUCKER-AHHHHHHH,

GOD, AHHHHHHHH,

MOTHERâ€¦!!â€

I used to think my dad
was angry cuz he drank.

NO. He drank cuz he was angry.

He swore to the day he died,

that when I was 22 years
old I tried to kill him.

Used to tell everybody,
used to tell everybody.

I was successful,
I had a TV Show,

â€œMr. Titus, your sonâ€™s really doing
well, heâ€™s got his own television show,

heâ€™s done a bunch of comedy
specials, you gotta be really proud.â€

â€œYeah, would be proud, but dumb-ass
tried to kill me when he was 22.â€

â€œThanks dad, thatâ€™s the network
president, thatâ€™s not helpful.â€

What happened was, well,

when I was 17 and a half,
my dad and I used to get in fistfights.

We would brawl, it was bad.

And I got my ass handed to
me pretty much all the time.

So, at 17 and a half,
I had moved out, I said,

â€œIâ€™m moving to San Francisco,
Iâ€™m going to become a stand-up comedian,

and Iâ€™m going to be
the best comedian ever,

and Iâ€™m gonna stuff it up your
ass, old man!â€

And I moved to San Francisco,
and I worked for 18 months,

4 shows a night, wrote â€˜til 4 a.m.
in the morning.

Yeah, and after 18 months.
HA HA!

I had to move back
to my dadâ€™s houseâ€¦

cuz it hadnâ€™t gone
how I had thought.

And I went to my plan B, which was
working at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

And if the humidityâ€™s right,
you can still smell it on me.

And I was a closer. And Iâ€™d drive
home every night in my little P.O.S.

and Iâ€™d drive it home and,
and after about 2 months,

this guy had parked his â€™56 Chevy
on his lawn on my route home,

and it said â€˜For Sale $1,800â€™

I stopped the car every night, and I would
just stand across the street, staring at it

And I fell in love with
the car â€“ I had to have it.

It was a mistake.

It was that first guy, love,
car thing and I just â€“ I had to have it.

So I saved up for 3 months,
and I get enough money, and I said,

â€œDad,
Iâ€™m gonna go buy this car.â€

And he said â€œThe Hell you are.â€

And I said â€œIâ€™m over 18 now,
you can suck it, old man.â€

With respect, because he controlled
the food and the shelter, though.

And my dad said something he
never said to me before, he said,

â€œLet me go with you,

Iâ€™ve made more mistakes
in my life than you have,

let me help you buy the car
so you donâ€™t get ripped off.â€

And I was 18,

and my first thought
was â€œWOOOAAHHHH.

Iâ€™m so suspicious.â€

But I had to admit it â€“ my
dad was a great salesman.

He was a GREAT salesman.
He got married 6 times,

he was a GREAAAT salesman.

GREAT salesman.

I still donâ€™t know how
he got number 6 to go

â€œIâ€™m a unicorn!â€

So we go to this guysâ€™ house,

we go to this guysâ€™ house
and, you know the car,

and Iâ€™m just all amped
up cuz I got my dad,

and Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ cocky, and I go,
â€œHow you doing? We came to look at the car.

Brought my dad.

He knows karate.â€

And my dad just goes,
â€œShut up, idiot!

Iâ€™m not letting you sell
my son this piece of crap.

Dad, are we gonna beat him and take it?
What are we doing?â€

â€œShut up! And he starts
walking around the car.

He just starts tearing it apart.

â€œBumpers are twisted,
rims donâ€™t match,

oh my god, the upholstery by
a blind Mexican in Tiajuana?â€

â€œDad, is this a technique?

Why are we making fun of handicapped
Hispanic people now, what are we doing?â€

â€œI told you to shut up!...

Iâ€™ll give you a thousand bucks for the
car, thatâ€™s it, take it or leave it.â€

And Iâ€™m just waiting
for this guy â€“

heâ€™s being so aggressive â€“
just, I want this guy to,

please punch my dad in throat.
Go ahead.

And instead,
the guy just goes â€œHold on.â€

And he walks in his house.

What we heard next,

for the next two minutes
was like a radio cartoon.

And the guy walks
in and we just hear,

â€œHey,
herraahherrraadaaahowwwyaa.â€

Then a pan bangs on
the front window.

And Iâ€™m 18,
so the look on my faceâ€¦

my dad, â€œThis is how it goesâ€¦â€

And he downloaded
another program.

And the guy walks back out,

and when the guy hit the door, it looked like
someone had injected him with three decades.

â€œOk, Iâ€™ll take a thousand.â€

And I thought, â€œI LOVE MY DAD!â€

And I remember it clearly because
it was the first time I thought it.

And we were driving home,
and he was right, the car was horrible.

But Iâ€™m like, I canâ€™t believe you got
me this car! I canâ€™t believe it, dad!

You saved me 800 bucks!
â€œI saved you 600 bucks.â€

â€œNo, dad,
1,800 minus a thousand is 800.â€

â€œIâ€™m keeping 200 bucks
for negotiating the deal.â€

And he downloaded
yet another program.

And he was right about this
car, he was so right about it.

It was horrible. The car, the steering
wheel was vaguely connected to something.

Youâ€™d spin it and it was like
the car had broken a hip,

it would just go â€“ ehhhhhhh-

but if you hit the brakes,
it made a HARD left,

becauseâ€¦

because the left front brake
was the only one that operated.

Remember that first car you had, guys?
That horrible one, man?

But you bought a fire extinguisher, mounted
inside cuz it looked so high-performance,

but also because you really
needed a fire extinguisher.

Cuz youâ€™d done some
wiring by yourself,

and now when you hit the blinker,
the windshield wipers stared up and,

you left it like that so you didnâ€™t
screw something else up. Youâ€™re like,

â€œNo, it works, watch. Iâ€™m going that way,
Iâ€™m going that way, Iâ€™m going that way.â€

Yeah.

Spent all that money on that
stereo, that really nice stereo,

but you couldnâ€™t figure
out how to mount it,

so it just sat on the
passenger seat for 3 months.

Wires snaking out of the dash.

You ran out of electrical tape, so you
used clear tape â€“ which was a bonus,

cuz now on Friday night when youâ€™re
hanging out with your buddies,

you could roll joints to the
sparks coming off the dash.

My dad had a client that gave
me this big spool of red wireâ€¦

I rewired the ENTIRE car
with one color of wire.

SHUT UP GUYS WHO KNOW
WHAT Iâ€™M TALKING ABOUT.

I knew it. It was perfect.

Power, ground, power, ground.

PERFECT.

Then, when I turned the key
on, it went

Andâ€¦ thank God I had
a fire extinguisher.

So I spend 4 years
working on this car.

And Iâ€™ve changed â€“
I fixed everything.

Because I broke everything in the
car, I ruined it.

From the rear-end to the
train, everything.

I had to fix everything. The suspension.
I broke everything in this car.

But after 22 it was
badassâ€¦ lowered downâ€¦

motor, brand new motor,
new tranny, it was great.

Burned tire, it was like 360,
460 horsepower, it was badass.

But the dumbest
car for a comedian

because I gotta drive to these
one-nighters all over California,

and every dime is going to gas.

Cuz the carburetor was a toilet
bowl, basically.

And I was in Northern
California where we lived

and I had to get down here to
LA to do a gig, one-nighter.

And I had just
enough money for gas.

And the car, the ballast
resistor in the car had gone bad.

The ballast resistor basically,

itâ€™s the thing that takes the
battery voltage and lowers it,

so it goes into the distributor
and doesnâ€™t burn... the point â€“

CAR NO WORK GOOD NO MORE.

And I couldnâ€™t afford the part.

I wouldnâ€™t have made the gas
money, and my dadâ€™s boat,

it was January, my dadâ€™s boat was
parked on the side of his house,

as I learned earlier in life â€“

it aint stealinâ€™ if
they â€˜aint usinâ€™ it!â€

Be careful what you download.

So, I took the ballast resistor to put
on the car, VROOM, made it to LA, woo!

And I donâ€™t think about it
again, for 6 months.

And then it was brought
to my attention.

Itâ€™s now Juneâ€¦ my dad, uh,
had gotten rid of stepmom number 5,

was looking for number
6, uh, playing the field,

and he was gonna take
her out in this boat.

And he backed his boat out and he
washed it up and it wouldnâ€™t start.

So he took the gas out,
put fresh gas in and it wouldnâ€™t start.

Now, itâ€™s a hot, California day.

Heâ€™s got a twelve pack of
beer that heâ€™s drinkinâ€™

â€“ or, snack pack of beer
that heâ€™s drinkinâ€™.

And heâ€™s just working in the hot sun
and heâ€™s getting angrier and angrier,

and he takes the spark plugs
out, wonâ€™t fix it,

he takes the distributor out,
checks all the wiring out,

get on the top, canâ€™t fix
it, changes the coil,

heâ€™s going back and
forth to the part store,

this goes on for four
and a half hours,

and finally he gets pissed and he
starts tracing the wiring harness

and he finds two wires
just hanging out in space.

And I know what he did,

he started spazz-mumbling
like I do.

â€œYou son of a bitch.
Heâ€™s a grown man now,

I canâ€™t believe he just wentâ€¦

Iâ€™m gonna find a
drill and cordless,

Iâ€™m gonna put it through his skull.
And you know what?

Itâ€™s not child abuse now,
now itâ€™s manslaughter, haha!

Yeah! Iâ€™ll run cell block D,

you kill your own kid,
you can run the prison, sir!â€

And he got angrier and angrier
and angrier and angrier,

and my dad, uh,
didnâ€™t do a whole lot of cardio.

And his heart went
Union and took a break.

He had a heart attack.

They called me and said,
â€œHe had a heart attackâ€

I said â€œOh my God,
he had a heart attack,â€

â€œItâ€™s a mild heart attack,â€ Thatâ€™s
what they told me. Iâ€™m like,

â€œUH, shall I bring yogurt, then?
Whatâ€™s a mild heart attack?â€

And I was 200 miles
away in Fresno,

and just like tonight,
I was just doin' a show,

I get off stage, the club managerâ€™s
got the phone out like this and he goes

â€œTake the phone,â€ I go
â€œWhat...â€ â€œTAKE THE PHONE.â€

And I take it, itâ€™s my fifth stepmother,
and this is how the conversation goes,

I go, â€œHello?â€ She says,

â€œYou killed your father!â€

â€œI have been here
the whole night!

No...

I understand why Iâ€™m a
suspect, but I have witnesses.â€

Then she says,
â€œDid you take something off his boat?â€

â€œOOOOOOOHHHH.â€

And I check how far Mexico isâ€¦

and I donâ€™t have the gas money.
Soâ€¦

I get up the next morning,
I drive to the hospital,

I walk into ICU, my dad is,
is hooked to machines, heâ€™s grey.

Itâ€™s weird, man, heâ€™s grey.

With fathers and sons, thereâ€™s a
weird thing like mothers and daughters

and I walked in and Iâ€™m
just looking at him,

and heâ€™s grey and heâ€™s hooked to
machines, and he looks weak andâ€¦

you gotta remember,
heâ€™s my Hitler, you know?

And I go, â€œDad, this is horrible,
oh my God, I canâ€™t believe this.

What did this feel
like?â€ And he says this,

â€œFelt like somebody parked
a garbage truck on my chest,

I couldnâ€™t feel anything.
I couldnâ€™t move, it was horrible.â€

I said, â€œDad, youâ€™ve been smoking
and drinking for 40 years, you know?

I mean, you start the
morning with pork rinds.

I think maybe itâ€™s timeâ€¦â€

And before I out the next
word, he goes

â€œHowâ€™s your fuckinâ€™
car running?â€

THATâ€™S HOW ANGRY
CHILDREN WILL MAKE YOU.

HE WAS HOOKED TO MACHINES!!

HE WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO
THE LIGHT TO MEET JEEEESUS

and he went â€“ HOLD ON, JESUS.
LET ME DEAL WITH DIPSHIT FIRST.

Thatâ€™s how angry.
Thatâ€™s how angry.

I donâ€™t want this
show to scare anybody.

This show, uh,

Iâ€™ve had pregnant women
leave this show like,

â€œThanks dickhead, thatâ€™s great.
Thank you.â€

Donâ€™t let this show scare you,

because if you do
your job as a parent,

keep downloading programs,

donâ€™t raise douchebags,
youâ€™ll be fine.

It takes a while.

I didnâ€™t realize I was doing
ok until my daughter turned 13,

she graduated 8th grade,
and they had a ceremony,

because they all
get ceremonies nowâ€¦

for everything. Oh my God,

she had a preschool ceremony,
a kindergarten ceremony,

a sixth grade ceremony, eighth gradeâ€¦
because theyâ€™re all so special.

â€œThomas, youâ€™re going to be the
best roofer ever, yes you are!

You need a ceremony.â€

Thatâ€™s right, â€œEthan, youâ€™re going to put those
cones on the freeway like nobodyâ€™s business, Ethan,

yes you are!

Margie, you are going
to be the BEST strip-

Exotic dancer, ever there was!â€

Yeah, yeah,
theyâ€™re all really special, ok.

Sheâ€™s going to have, they have eighth grade
graduation ceremony, uh, so weâ€™re gonna go.

Now,
I have to set this story up.

Everyone in this room has a psychotic
relative that lives too close to them.

The problem is you have to invite
them to Thanksgiving and Christmas,

because if you donâ€™t, they may drive
by, notice they werenâ€™t invited,

and then thereâ€™s
gonna be a drive-by.

In my family itâ€™s my
Aunt, sheâ€™s 63,

sheâ€™s my motherâ€™s sister,
my mom was crazy, used to hear voices,

and my aunt also hears voices,
but she calls them â€˜her guides.â€™

And her guides
PREDICT THE FUTURE!

THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED, EVER!

5 years ago, she said down at the
dinner table with us and said this,

weâ€™re just eating
dinner, she goes,

â€œMy guides told me Iâ€™m
gonna die in August.â€

â€œWell, tick tock.â€

She also doesnâ€™t have a job,

â€œCuz I aint payinâ€™
Obamaâ€™s taxes!â€

But sheâ€™s willing
to live off of ours.

I will say this, you know,
sheâ€™s also got some great skills.

I told her, I said, youâ€™re a great
cook, go work at a bakery,

under the table for cash,
itâ€™ll be phenomenal.

She goes, â€œI canâ€™t,
if I stand too long, my back hurts.â€

I said,
â€œI got a buddy who works at Hulu,

you could actually do like,
tech support in the morning.â€

â€œAh, if I sit too
long, my back hurts.â€

â€œWell, that leaves, hooker.

Andâ€¦ at 63, youâ€™re not really
a first-round draft pick.â€

Now, donâ€™t get me wrong,
I love her to death.

Sheâ€™s my aunt, been asking to be in my
show for a long time...there you go.

Now, something else has
happened in my life.

I â€“ uh, I got married again.
Uh, for the second time.

Because love is possible â€“ you just
gotta get rid of your first wife.

Or, first husband,
depending on the sexual organ, either way.

So, I marriedâ€¦ sheâ€™s amazing.

And my kidsâ€¦ I have â€˜em 50/50â€¦

so my ex has them half the
time, and then half the time,

me and my new wife,
WERE LIVINâ€™ THE LAMBORGHINI LIFE!

We were going to
concerts, and partyingâ€¦

and going,
and have resortsâ€¦ it was AMAZING.

And then her MOM got sick,
and moved in with us.

And â€“ and thatâ€™s good too.

Her mom was also 63,

but her mom and my aunt
are different people.

Her motherâ€™s got a
Masters degree in fine art

sheâ€™s an amazing artist. She was running
a department at an American University,

and sheâ€™s, sheâ€™s hardcore.
Sheâ€™s pretty hardcore.

Her and I argue sometimes.

And, sheâ€™s always,
sheâ€™s always right.

I donâ€™t mean, she thinks sheâ€™s always right,
I mean, I go look it up and fuck, sheâ€™s right.

Itâ€™s annoying.
Itâ€™s really annoying.

And her and my auntâ€¦
donâ€™t reallyâ€¦ get along.

They donâ€™t play Gin together.
Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ itâ€™s imagineâ€¦

how I imagine Charlie Sheen and
Ghandi would get along. Likeâ€¦

â€œWINNING!!â€ â€œNO,
YOU ARE NOT WINNING TODAY!â€

So, her mom is sick,
and I call my aunt, and I go,

â€œHey,â€ now weâ€™re back to this story,
â€œHey, would you do us a favor?â€

Uh, my kids go to
a Christian School,

â€œWould you reserve us seats in the chapel
for the 8th grade graduation ceremony?"

My aunt says she
would, and uh, we go.

So, we show up at the ceremony.

My aunt has saved us seats

for my daughtersâ€™ graduation.

DIRECTLY

behind my ex-wife.

We donâ€™t get along very well.

We hate each-others guts.

And she hates my new wife,
and my new wife LOVES that.

And then my wifeâ€™s mother and
my aunt have this weird thing.

If the church knew how much
EVIL was in that little areaâ€¦

like, the Jesus on
the cross was like,

â€œDoes anyone see whatâ€™s
going on over there?

Right there.

Oh myâ€¦

Why has thou forsaken
me, again?â€

So we just sit down, and Iâ€™m just
grumbling, and they start the ceremony.

Hereâ€™s how the ceremony starts
for the 8th grade graduation.

Pastor gets up and goes,
â€œYou know, tonight,

I want to talk about mothers.
Cuz mothers,

are the most amazing
thing in the world.

They give birth, they give life,

then through love and nurturing,
raise the amazing young adults behind me.

Without mothers, we have no Earth,
without mother, we have no species.

Now, in my head, Iâ€™m thinking,

â€œSo, I guess fathers, what?
Fill the car with gas and wash it?

Is that our gig?â€

But,
you canâ€™t heckle in a church.

Only gotta tell me once...

So it continues like
that for a while,

â€œMothers, mothers, mothers,
mothers, blah blah blah, mothers.â€

And then they say,
â€œWe would now,

like all the mothers
to please stand.â€

Well, my new wife has raised my
daughter half the time for nine years.

So, she stood up.

And my ex-wife stood up
right in front of her

and I went â€“ HMMMMMMM

and I can feel the
tumor starting.

And my aunt goes, â€œOh my God,

itâ€™s the mom and the evil stepmother.
Itâ€™s the mom and the evil stepmother.

Itâ€™s the mom and
the evil stepmother.

And her mother,
whoâ€™s on chemo goes,

â€œSAY IT ONE MORE TIME.â€

I look up, Jesus is weeping.

They then said, â€œWe now,

are gonna give each child a yellow
rose to walk out to their mother.â€

Jesus got out a pry-bar.

â€œIâ€™m not doinâ€™ this, nope.â€

And they start handing
roses to children,

and theyâ€™re going down the center
aisle, and heâ€™s the scene.

Church music,
church lighting and mothers weeping.

It was beauuuutiful.

And then I realized, Oh,
thatâ€™s why they didnâ€™t bring up fathers.

â€œDad, hereâ€™s a yellow rose.â€

â€œShut up and sit down.

Tomorrow weâ€™re getting
you some yoga pantsâ€¦

fruit cup.â€

So the kids are
walking the roses outâ€¦

And it justâ€¦ itâ€™s just mothers
weeping and itâ€™s beautiful.

My daughter gets up to her turn.

And the pastor
holds up the rose,

and my daughter doesnâ€™t take it.

And I thought, â€œWell,
letâ€™s see where this goesâ€¦â€

Now, while my ex and my new
wife are standing there,

I have a moment to
compare and contrast.

My new wife,
is 13 years younger than my ex-wife.

I think,
I think thatâ€™s a win in my column.

My ex-wife didnâ€™t even go to college.
My new wife has two college degrees

doesnâ€™t use â€˜em and is
still paying for â€˜em.

I think thatâ€™s a win
in my ex-wifeâ€™s column.

And theyâ€™re different, you know,
my new wife is uh, sheâ€™s very beautiful.

Sheâ€™s very tall.
Sheâ€™s smart, sheâ€™s funny,

she loves me more
than anybody ever has.

And sheâ€™s, tall,
sheâ€™s this tall.

And my ex-wife isâ€¦

Closer to Hell. Anyway.

Thatâ€™s how I say
shorter, anyway.

So, weâ€™re all just
watching my daughter

like, whatâ€™s gonna happen here,

and we see my daughter,
while the pastorâ€™s holding the rose,

she just mouths,

â€œI have two moms.â€

Yeah, California, you think they
wouldâ€™ve thought about that.

â€œI need another rose.â€

And the pastor kinda
shakes the rose angrily.

And the kids behind my
daugh-everything stopped.

The kids are like

And my daughter goes â€“ my daughter
just stands her ground and goes,

â€œI haaave TWO MOMS.

I NEEEEED ANOTHER ROSE!â€

And we hear the pastor go,

â€œWe donâ€™t have any EXTRAS.

TAKE IT.â€

And thereâ€™s this beat, and then my
daughter looks him right in the eye,

snatches the rose, holds it up,

and RIPS IT IN HALF.

She walks down the center
steps, man.

And I KNOW what everybody
was thinking in the church,

â€œOh well, thereâ€™s the Titus kid.

Wow. Wow.

Who had their money on
â€˜rips the rose in half?â€™â€

And as my daughter is
walking down the aisle,

sheâ€™s snapping the stem. She takes
half the petals and rips â€˜em off.

Takes the other
half, rips â€˜em off.

She walks up and hands her
two moms this destroyed rose.

And hugged them.

And I thought - My Godâ€¦

in an impossible situation,
in front of a live audience,

this kid had the
calm, the courage

and the love to make sure no
one got their feelings hurt.

OR, I have raised
the biggest a-holeâ€¦

who just wanted to make a point about
the shitty divorce we put her through.

Like, by the wayâ€¦ this
rose, itâ€™s a metaphor.

Itâ€™s me. Snap. There you go!
You happy now?

I want you to know that everybody in this area
just bought future therapist a ski-boat, suck it!

Now,

I hope thatâ€™s not it.

But, Iâ€™d be ok with that too.

Now, thatâ€™s a great story.

Now, if you have a kid, and you think
my kid would never be that cool.

My kid will never have that
kind of insight or calmâ€¦

youâ€™re wrong.
Just keep doing your job.

Becauseâ€¦ thisâ€¦ that
was a girl thatâ€™s 13.

At 11, my daughterâ€™s the same kid
that got the cops called on me.

Iâ€™m not sayn' they
didnâ€™t need to be called,

Iâ€™m just sayin she
made it happen.

Now, I have my kids 50/50.

Which means my ex has them for a
week, and I have â€˜em for a week.

So my ex has 7 days to poison their
minds, and make them HATE meâ€¦

and then I have 7 daysâ€¦

to do absolutely
nothing, your honor.

But I will admit thisâ€¦ my
ex-wife and I are infants.

We are immature idiots.

We, we canâ€™t get along at all.

We canâ€™t even drop the kids
off at each-othersâ€™ houses.

The court has said
that we fight so bad,

that they only way
we get the kids

is go to McDonaldâ€™s and
have a hostage transfer.

Itâ€™s like getting your kids out
of North Korea every Monday.

I pull up on the South side of the
lot, she pulls up on the North side.

I stand in front of my car,

she puts the kids
in front of her car,

then I gotta hold up
the child support check.

She sends my son over, cuz she doesnâ€™t
think heâ€™s smart enough to escape.

I think heâ€™s a
double-agent, frankly.

He walks back,
she checks the amount,

and the kids clasp hands

and slowly make their way,

across the Mickey DMZ.

So, I show up one
morning at â€˜the dropâ€™

and as I get out of the car, my daughterâ€™s
already out of her momâ€™s car yelling at me.

Sheâ€¦ and I get out andâ€¦ I
go, â€œWhat?â€

And she goes,
â€œIâ€™m not going with you today, dad.

Momâ€™s been quiet all
week, and she said that,

if I leave,
sheâ€™s gonna go crazy,

and she doesnâ€™t know,
so I canâ€™t leave cuz sheâ€™s upset,

SO Iâ€™M NOT GOING WITH YOU!â€

And, I learned something with
kids early on. Donâ€™t yell at â€˜em.

Canâ€™t yell at â€˜em.
If it worked I would do it ALLLL day long.

But it doesnâ€™t. And if you yell too
much, eventually they get your frequency.

And all of â€˜em, have this weird
internal Bose noise cancelling system.

And once they get your yell
frequency, itâ€™s over.

To them, you just sound like
a Yamaha way in the distance.

â€œI TOLD YOU KIDS TO TURN THIS
TELEVISION OFF AND CLEAN YOUR

ROOMS AND... ANOTHERâ€¦

â€¦â€

I have stood in front of
my children and realized,

wow, theyâ€™re watching
television THROUGH me right now.

So as a parent you need
to develop a second voice.

I call it the youâ€™re dead voice,

thereâ€™s a lot of dads here that
know what Iâ€™m talking about.

Itâ€™s a voice you only
use once in a while,

when you have a big life lesson a big
life download. Thatâ€™s what you use it for.

First time I used it on my son,

he was 7

my voice is a combination of Barry
White, Clint Eastwood and Darth Vader.

And we caught him lying.

And he was at the age where
he thought he invented lying.

Turns out, if you donâ€™t tell
them what really happened,

you could get away
with anything.

Heâ€™s such an idiot.

And we had him, it was like CSI.

Hereâ€™s the blood spatter,
hereâ€™s the fingerprints, hereâ€¦

heâ€™s like, â€œNOPE!
I didnâ€™t do it.â€

And I lost it, I just went,

â€œDID YOU LIE TO ME?

OH, Iâ€™M GONNA ASK
YOU ONE MORE TIME.

DID YOU LIE TO YOUR FATHER?

DID YOU??!!â€

He came off the
ground, it was great.

His legs shot up,
I know he pooped himself a little bit.

I canâ€™t prove it, because he was
wearing two pairs of underwear

but I suspect!

So my daughterâ€™s standing in the
middle of McDonaldâ€™s parking lot.

Screaming at me.

And I just went,

â€œGET IN THE CAR.â€

She goes,
â€œNO!â€ But her body started moving.

Thatâ€™s when you know
I got the voice right.

When you override their nervous
systemâ€¦ thatâ€™s the voice.

She goes, â€œIâ€™m not getting in
the car.â€ Poof. Sheâ€™s in the car.

My sonâ€™s been in the car three
minutes,

And now, my ex-wife says
something horrible to me

and I say something horrible back,
we get in the car and Iâ€™m like,

â€œGod this is so stupid,
two adults canâ€™t even get this handled,â€

and Iâ€™m grumbling to myself,
and I go to start my car,

and my daughter gets her
facilities back and goes,

â€œIâ€™m not going with
you, I told you, Dad.â€

And she gets out of the
car, and I had enough.

I pick up the phone, I dial 911.

Because LAPD has
SO much free time.

â€œ911 emergency,
whatâ€™s your emergency?â€

â€œUh, yeah.
Weâ€™re having a custody situation,

over here at the McDonaldâ€™s

on Ventura and Sherman Oaksâ€¦â€

And hereâ€™s when I know
Iâ€™ve gone too far.

I hear the 911 operator go,

â€œUghhhhhâ€¦

Sir, are the children
in any danger?â€

â€œUh, yeahâ€¦ cuz theyâ€™re with
a bitch in my opinion.â€

And again you just
hear, â€œUghhhhhhâ€¦

Alright, sir,
I will send a unit and two uniforms.â€

â€œYeah, make sure thereâ€™s people
in those uniforms, thank YOU.â€

Just an idiot.

Now, my daughters been standing by the
door listening on the Bluetooth in my car,

and she realized itâ€™s getting serious.
She gets back in the car.

â€œFine, dad, Iâ€™ll go with you.â€

We start driving to the
house and Iâ€™m just soâ€¦

and by the time I get to
the house Iâ€™m at an 11,

Iâ€™m so pissed off.
And I walk in,

I grab her backpack and I put it
in front of her bedroom and I go,

â€œYouâ€™re grounded, thatâ€™s it,
get in your room right now!â€

And my new wife is
standing right there.

My new wife â€“ whoâ€™s never had
children and she married me.

So sheâ€™s livinâ€™ the nightmare!

To you people in here
tonight that decided to

marry into someone
elseâ€™s horribly broken,

destructed divorced familyâ€¦

I want you to know something.

You are heroes. Heroes.

Yes. Yes. Yeah.

And I mean that in a Special
Olympics kind of wayâ€¦

Cuz youâ€™re obviously
very sweet and loving,

not that smart,
yet you all deserve metals.

Yes you do! Yes you do!!

So, she sees me flipping
out, and she goes,

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ And
hereâ€™s what I said, I went,

â€œOH! Thisâ€¦ youâ€¦ and she comes
outâ€¦ â€˜I canâ€™tâ€™... AHHHH!!â€

And I just walk away.
I was SO PISSED.

I couldnâ€™t speak English.

And I walk into the
kitchen, Iâ€™m just madâ€¦

I go, â€œGive me a second!â€
And I open the cupboard,

I grab the first
glass that was there,

it was just this weird
round, stemless wine glass,

and I grab some pomegranate
juice and I fill it up â€“

I started juicing, Ahhh,
because kids give you tumors!

And I put it in and I put
it back and I close the door

and I start walking back to my new
wife, Iâ€™m like,

â€œYou wonâ€™t believe
what just happened.

I get out of the car, sheâ€™s like

â€˜I canâ€™t go with youâ€™ and her momâ€™s behind
her just shoveling crap on top of her,â€

and as I get to my new wife,

we hear

and I go to the peephole,

and thereâ€™s two LAPD
officers standing outside.

And theyâ€™re standing
like cops stand,

when they want you to
know that theyâ€™re cops.

What are you a human
puffer-fish, what are you doing?

I just kept waiting for one to
go, â€œBAAAA-KAAAAAW!â€

So I open the door and it
gets real serious real fast.

I go, â€œYeah,â€ He goes, â€œMr.
Titus?â€ I go, â€œYeah.â€

â€œStep back, right now,

whereâ€™s your daughter.
We were told youâ€™re abusing your daughter.

WHERE IS YOUR DAUGHTER?â€

I look behind them,

and sitting in the back seat of
the cop car, in front of my house,

is my ex-wife. Which is not the last time my
ex-wifeâ€™s gonna be in the back of a cop car.

Iâ€™m working on that nowâ€¦

I go, â€œWhatâ€™s this about?â€

And he goes, â€œWhere is your
daughter, RIGHT NOW?â€

And I donâ€™t realize it,
but Iâ€™m standing in front of the cops,

holding a wine glass,

full of red liquid, to the top.

And itâ€™s noon.

Cuz nothing says abusive father more
than a little side of raging alcoholic!

And I go,
â€œCan we talkâ€¦â€ He goes,

â€œRIGHT NOW, WHERE IS SHE?â€

I go, â€œSheâ€™s in her room, right
there,â€ and Iâ€™m starting to get shaky,

â€œSheâ€™s right there, go talk to
her, sheâ€™s right there.â€

And they go,
â€œYou stand right here.â€

And the cops go to the door,

and they look back at
my new wife and they go,

â€œWould you go in with us?â€ Because even
the LAPD is afraid of an 11-year-old.

And they walk in,
and they do stuff for like 7 minutes,

and... be cool to your kids.

Donâ€™t be the parent
that causes the psycho.

Cuz, despite your
daughter, if she wanted to,

she could have sailed me down the river, she
could have made up some lie, but she didnâ€™t.

She said, â€œNo,
Dad justâ€¦ picked me up.

Mom got me amped up,
itâ€™s my fault, I flipped out.â€

So, cops come back out.
But theyâ€™re still all roostered up on me.

And I go, â€œIs everything ok?â€

and they, â€œNo, it is not ok, whereâ€™s your
son? Weâ€™re told youâ€™re abusing your son also.â€

and hereâ€™s my problemâ€¦

thatâ€™s fair.

Hereâ€™s one of my problemsâ€¦

I was raised in a lot of stress.

My mom was mentally ill, I used to go visit her
at mental institutions when I was a little kid.

My dad got divorced six times,
three of them before I was 10,

so at one point,
while being raised by my dadâ€¦

there was so much alimony going
outâ€¦ food got a little bit rare.

But my father never let onâ€¦

unlike today, where everyoneâ€™s
depressed, â€œI have depressionâ€¦â€

My dad never let on once.

At one point, we have my second,
my dadâ€™s second wife cleaned us out.

We had just had a,
we had rubber raft for a couch

and all my dad would
do, is cracking jokes.

â€œHey, weâ€™re gonna sleep in
the Titanic tonight, ha ha.â€

Never stopped being funny,
no matter how weirdâ€¦

I knew as a kidâ€¦ I
knew it was weird.

You know, cuz I had friends who
had other... you guys have shit!

But he never let on that it was
weird, and I love him for that.

You know,
he never let on it was weird.

So, as a child, I learned very early, that
in a high-pressure, high-stress situationâ€¦

youâ€™re supposed to be funny.

But sometimes the LAPDâ€¦

doesnâ€™t get it.

Now thisâ€™ll sound like a joke
â€“ this is what I actually said,

I turn and I go,
â€œSON, GET OUT HERE.

I WANT YOU TO TELL THE
COPS HOW OFTEN I BEAT YOU.â€

Not realizing â€“ Oh, wowâ€¦ I just
gave them testimonyâ€¦ thatâ€™s amazing!

And the cops donâ€™t smile at all,
but my son, thank God for my son,

my son knows me so wellâ€¦
my son walks out and goes,

â€œOk, dad. Iâ€™ll tell â€˜em.â€

Yeah, the older cop goes,
â€œWhy doesnâ€™t he have pants on?â€

â€œWeâ€™ve been home 9 minutes,
what are you doinâ€™?â€

â€œI was getting ready
to go play soccer.â€

â€œWhy did you stop that?â€

I started watching trick
videos on Youtube.â€

â€œReally?

In the middle of changing
clothes, you got side-tracked?

Do you know what makes me CRA...

Could you please
put on some pants?

He is such a scamp, is he not?â€

Son disappears,
comes back with some shorts on

walks into the room with the cops,
and right before the door closed, I hear,

â€œWhat is that smell?â€ click.

And I donâ€™t know what
my son said to the copsâ€¦

my daughter was
in there a whileâ€¦

she was in there like 7
minutes, it was tense.

My son was in there less than a minute.
I donâ€™t know what happened.

All I can guess is they
went, â€œWhatâ€™d your dad do?â€

â€œDadâ€™s cool. â€

and the cops went â€œUgghhh.â€

Cops come back out and
theyâ€™re not mad at me anymore.

Theyâ€™re pissed now, but different.
It's different.

And the young guy walks right up to
me, gets this close to me, and he goes,

â€œMr. Titus,
I want you to know somethingâ€¦â€

â€œIf THAT was MY ex-wifeâ€¦

Iâ€™d be drinking this early too.â€

Thank you guys so much!

Thank you guys!!

You guys were amazing!!
