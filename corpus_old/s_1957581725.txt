â™ª NOW AND THEN I GET BENT â™ª

â™ª FROM ALL THE THINGS
I CANNOT CHANGE â™ª

â™ª IT'S JUST MY CIRCUMSTANCE â™ª

â™ª AND IN MY HEAD, I AM DEAD â™ª

â™ª WHEN DEEP INSIDE
I FEEL NO PAIN â™ª

HEY, JERK!

â™ª I'M HANGING BY A THREAD â™ª

â™ª TORN INSIDE MY MIND â™ª

â™ª SO I'M TURNING
TO THE OTHER SIDE â™ª

â™ª I HEAR YOU CALL ME â™ª

â™ª IN MY DREAM
YOU'RE RIGHT BESIDE ME â™ª

â™ª TAKE AWAY MY LIFE â™ª

â™ª I HEAR YOU CALL ME â™ª

â™ª IN MY DREAM
YOU'RE RIGHT BESIDE ME â™ª

â™ª I KNOW THAT I'LL DO â™ª

â™ª ANYTHING YOU ASK
I'LL DO FOR YOU â™ª

â™ª FOR YOU â™ª

â™ª FOR YOU â™ª

HEY, COACH WANTS US TO BE
UP THE RINK EARLY TONIGHT,

SO WE CAN WARM UP
FOR THE GAME.

LIKE I NEED IT.

ANTICIPATE THE BALL.

[ GASPS ]

[ LAUGHS ]
DUDE, SHE TOTALLY BIFFED IT.

KEEP WALKING, GUYS.

YOU TOO, COLTON.

ARE YOU OKAY?

YEAH.

NICE SERVE.

YOU TRYING TO SHOW ME UP?
NICE HIT.

NOW IF ONLY YOU COULD DO THT
EVERY TIME.

[ WHISTLES ]
LET'S BRING IT IN!

LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
HUSTLE.

YOU'RE DOING
SO MUCH BETTER.

YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T GET
MY BACKHAND.

SORRY ABOUT MY BROTHER.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S COLTON'S.

ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

A LOT OF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT
THE CLAIRVILLE TENNIS PROGRAM.

IT'S A INVITATION-ONLY CAMP
HELD OVER THE SUMMER,

AND THOSE THAT ARE CHOSEN

WILL BE PLAYING WITH THE VERY
BEST OF PLAYERS --

EVEN PROS.

NOW, I CALLED IN A FAVOR
AND CONVINCED THEM

TO COME SEE YOU AT THE END
OF THE SEASON.

NOW, IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A LOT
OF HARD WORK AND DEDICATION,

AND I THINK YOU'RE ALL
GREAT PLAYERS.

I THINK YOU ALL HAVE A CHANCE
OF BEING CHOSEN,

BUT NOT WITHOUT PRACTICE.

SO LET'S GET BACK TO IT.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

[ DOOR CLOSES ]

COLTON, WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

COME, SIT DOWN.
WE'VE ALREADY BLESSED THE FOOD.

WE GOT YOUR QUARTER'S
REPORT CARD.

SO?
HEY!

SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT,
COLTON.

WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE?

IF YOU DON'T GET
YOUR GRADES UP,

NO UNIVERSITY
WILL ACCEPT YOU.

CAN I STAY OUT
TILL 11:00 TONIGHT?

I'M GOING
TO THE HOCKEY GAME.

GREAT.

HEY, WE'LL GO, TOO.

NO, YOU WON'T!

COLTON, WE WANT
TO WATCH YOU PLAY.

I DON'T CARE.

Ashley: IT'S THE LAST GAME
OF THE SEASON.

I'M GOING, AND IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF YOU.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE LET US, SO --

SO, WHY START AGAIN NOW?!

[ SIGHS ]

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

TO THE GAME!

[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

[ THE PLANET SMASHERS'
"SHE'S LATE" PLAYS ]

Man: WELCOME TO THE FINAL
ELIMINATION GAME...

SARA!

SO, HOW WAS PRACTICE?

ASK LIZ.

HEY, I DID WELL.

Man: AND THE BLUE DEVILS
STEAL THE WIN!

I'M SO EXCITED
FOR THE CLAIRVILLE CAMP,

BUT I DOUBT I'LL MAKE IT.

DON'T SAY THAT.

EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY USUALLY
CHOOSE THE JUNIORS OR SENIORS,

AND I'M JUST A SOPHOMORE.

HEY, YOU NEVER KNOW.

[ BUZZER ]

Man: HE SHOOTS...

NO GOOD!

SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER
WHAT THEY DO,

THE MAPLE LEAFS AREN'T GONNA
CATCH A BREAK.

YOUR BROTHER IS SO HOT.

IF YOU THINK SO, LIZ.

IF ONLY THE THOUGHT OF HIM
DIDN'T MAKE ME GAG.

SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT.

IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

REMEMBER, I LIVE WITH HIM.

Crowd: OHH!

Man: AND THAT'S THE END
OF A LOSING SEASON

FOR THE MAPLE LEAFS.

HEY, COLTON.
THAT WAS A GOOD GAME TONIGHT.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF ANYONE
ELSE HAD BEEN PLAYING.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

YEAH, IF THE GOALIE WOULD HAVE
DONE HIS JOB,

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

THAT'S RIGHT.

Girl: HEY, JOHN.

IT HAD TO BE THE LAST GAME
FOR US, TOO.

TOTALLY THEIR FAULT.

[ LAUGHS ]

EDDIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

OH, HE'S JUST HANGING OUT
WITH US.

ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?

OH, SARA, BY THE WAY,

THAT WAS SOME PRETTY FANCY
FOOTWORK YOU WERE DOING.

ALWAYS SPEND THAT MUCH TIME
ON YOUR BUTT?

[ LAUGHTER ]

NOT AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU DID TONIGHT.

OHH.
OHH.                        OHH.

WHY DON'T YOU GET LOST,
NARK?

COME ON, SARA.

B-B-B-BYE!

[ LAUGHS ]

GOOD MORNING.
WHAT ARE YOU COOKING?

OMELET.

WE HAVE GREEN PEPPERS, TOMATOES,
CHEESE, MUSHROOMS,

AND THEN A LITTLE SALSA
TO TOP IT OFF.

WELL, THAT LOOKS
REALLY GOOD.

HOW WAS WORK?

OH, LONG.

PARTY OF 10 CAME INTO
THE RESTAURANT FOR DINNER,

THEN ONE OF THEM GOT SICK
ON VEAL,

AND THAT TRIGGERED IT
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, AND --

WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
IT WASN'T PRETTY.

WELL, ON THAT NOTE...

THANKS.

THAT LOOKS GREAT.
HOW WAS PRACTICE YESTERDAY?

SAME AS USUAL.

WHAT?

IS COACH GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME?

WHAT? NO, I MEAN, I GUESS
I SHOULD BE EXCITED.

HE SAID SOME CLAIRVILLE PEOPLE
ARE COMING TO OUR SCHOOL.

REALLY?

YEAH. AND HE THINKS I HAVE
A REALLY GREAT SHOT

OF GETTING INVITED.

WELL, HE'S RIGHT.

MOM.

SARA, YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST
PLAYERS ON THE TEAM.

WELL, THAT'S TILL I HAVE TO PLAY
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY

AND GET NERVOUS AND MESS UP.

DON'T PSYCHE YOURSELF OUT.

TOO LATE.

FINALLY.
WHATEVER.

YOU'RE TWO HOURS LATE.
MIKE WOULD BE TICKED,

AND I HAVEN'T HAD A BREAK
SINCE MY SHIFT STARTED.

WELL, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

COVER MY REGISTER.

NO WAY. THIS GUY'S
GONNA PROBABLY ORDER
TWO OF EVERYTHING.

I COVERED FOR YOU BEING LATE.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

AND BE NICE.

I WANT TWO EXTRA-LARGE POPCORNS
AND DRINKS,

AND DO YOU SUPERSIZE?

NO.

THAT'LL BE $11.50.

Girl: HEY, WHAT'S UP?

NO, I'M WORKING.

YEAH, ARE WE STILL ON
FOR TONIGHT?

YEAH, I'LL CALL YOU.

OKAY, BYE.

[ TELEPHONE BEEPS ]

OKAY, I'M BACK.

OH, I'M GLAD.
THANKS.

COLTON.

BLAKE, GUYS.
WHAT'S UP?

WHEN DO YOU GET OFF WORK?

YEAH, DUDE,
WE ARE SO BORED.

I CAN THINK OF SOMETHING
TO FIX THAT.

WHERE'S EDDIE?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GOT TO RUN.

YOU JUST GOT HERE.

WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

LET'S GO, GUYS.

[ SPRAY-PAINT CANS RATTLING ]

YOU HANG OUT WITH US,
YOU DO WHAT WE DO.

Blake: READY, BRO?

John:
LET'S DO THIS THING.

HEY!

DUDE!

YEAH, SOMEONE JUST VANDALIZED
THE CHURCH.

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

STAY DOWN.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

WHO'S OUT HERE?
I CALLED THE POLICE.

THE BEST THING FOR YOU
IS JUST GIVE YOURSELVES UP.

JUST HELP CLEAN UP THE MESS.

I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET
IN TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

[ GRUNTING ]

COME ON, DUDE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

YOU KNOW WHAT TIME COLTON
CAME HOME?

HE WASN'T HERE LAST NIGHT
AT MIDNIGHT WHEN I CHECKED,

BUT HE'S HERE NOW.

3:43 A.M.
WHAT?

HE GOT HOME AT 3:43
IN THE MORNING.

HE WOKE ME UP WHEN HE HIT
HIS FOOT AGAINST HIS WEIGHTS.

THAT'S TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW
PAST MIDNIGHT.

I CAN'T WAIT TILL MY CURFEW
DOESN'T EXIST.

COLTON HAS A CURFEW.

HE JUST CHOOSES NOT
TO FOLLOW IT,

AND HE WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

EXCELLENT.

I GOT TO SEE IF ANYBODY'S
HAD ANY BETTER LUCK

CLEANING THAT STUFF
OFF THE CHURCH.

WHAT STUFF OFF THE CHURCH?

SOMEONE GRAFFITIED
THE CHURCH LAST NIGHT.

WHO?
I DON'T KNOW.

BISHOP COOPER SAW FOUR OF THEM,
AND ONE OF THEM ATTACKED HIM.

IS HE ALL RIGHT?
I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE,

BUT WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS

WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

WHAT?!

CHURCH STARTS IN 10 MINUTES.
ARE YOU GOING?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

I JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

WELL, DON'T.

FINE!

SO, WE'RE PLAYING
VOLLEYBALL

AT OUR NEXT MUTUAL
ACTIVITY.

OH, YEAH.

OH, MY AIM IS
TERRIBLE.

AMAZING, SINCE IN TENNIS,
IT'S DEADLY.

HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT
YOU CAN BE SO GOOD AT ONE SPORT

AND MISERABLE AT ANOTHER
RELATED SPORT?

IT'S NOT RELATED.
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

BROTHER NIXON SAID
WE SHOULD BRING OTHERS,

ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVEN'T
BEEN AT CHURCH LATELY.

THERE'S ALWAYS
COLTON PRATT.

DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT.

IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

WHAT?

YOU DON'T KNOW?

WELL, I KNOW HE'S A JERK.

YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS.

MNH-MNH.
DO WE HAVE TO RELIVE THIS?

NO, JUST YOU.

SO, LAST YEAR,
COLTON WAS GETTING READY

TO BE SUSTAINED
AS PRIEST --

YOU KNOW, WHERE THE BISHOP ASKS
IF THERE ARE ANY OPPOSED,

AND NO ONE RAISES
THEIR HAND?

WELL, SOMEONE DID.
SARA.

HE HAD TO PULL BOTH
OF THEM OUT INTO THE
HALL AND FIND OUT WHY.

SARA SAID THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
DRINKING THE NIGHT BEFORE.

HE FINALLY FESSED UP
AND LEFT.

ALL OF THIS HAPPENED RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF CHURCH.

THANK YOU, LIZ.
LET'S MOVE ON.

WOW.

EVER SINCE THEN,
HE'S BEEN WORSE.

HE'S MEAN, AND, WELL,
YOU'VE SEEN IT.

WELL, WHAT ABOUT EDDIE?

I DON'T THINK SO.

HE'S BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH COLTON A LOT LATELY.

MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
BETTER FRIENDS.

HE USED TO HANG OUT
WITH US,

BUT NOW HE THINKS
COLTON'S SO "COOL."

WELL, EDDIE LIVES DOWN
THE STREET FROM ME.

I'LL INVITE HIM.

GOOD LUCK.

Colton: HEY,
YOU GOT THE HOMEWORK?

OH, YEAH. HERE.

COME ON, EDDIE.

HEY, EDDIE.
WHAT'S UP?

UH, HEY.

WHO ARE YOU?

I'M -- UH, D-DALLEN.

REMEMBER?
UH, FROM CHURCH.

[ CAR DOOR CLOSES ]

W-WE HAD SOME CLASSES,
UM, TOGETHER

BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH.

MS. SAWYER FOR SPANISH

AND I THINK, UH, BUCKLEY
FOR SCIENCE.

SO?

UM, WELL, ACTUALLY I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO EDDIE.

W-WE'RE PLAYING
VOLLEYBALL TOMORROW,

AND WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF Y-YOU COULD COME.

HE DOESN'T CARE.

ACTUALLY I JUST WANT-T-ED
TO TALK TO HIM.

WELL, D-D-D-D-DALLEN,
WHAT ARE YOU -- STUPID?

EDDIE'S NOT INTERESTED.
YEAH.

OH, AND, UH, JUST BECAUSE YOU
SAT NEXT TO ME YEARS AGO

DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD EVER
TALK TO ME AGAIN.

NO.
I J-JUST WANTED --

I REMEMBER YOU.
EVERYONE CALLED YOU "TARD."

YOU GOT MOVED TO SOME
RESOURCE CLASS

'CAUSE OF YOUR S-STUTTER.

[ LAUGHTER ]

NOW, GET OUTTA HERE!

Man: NICE SHOT.
THERE IT IS. YEAH.

YES. GOOD PLAY.

OH!

Man #2:
HERE YOU GO, SARA.

YOUR SERVE.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

HEY! WATCH IT!

GIVE ME THAT.

Ashley: HEY!

TRY PLAYING WITH THIS.

COLTON!

HERE, DUDE.

AT LEAST EDDIE CAME.
[ CHUCKLES ]

[ KNOCKS ON DOOR ]

COLTON, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

OH, GREAT.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

HAVE YOU SEEN MY SHIRT?

WHAT SHIRT?

THE WHITE ONE --
WITH THE NUMBERS.

IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME
TO BRING IT UP, NOT WITH COLTON.

WE GOT A CALL
FROM EDDIE'S MOM.

I GOT COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS
ABOUT SOMETHING YOU GUYS DID.

WHY DO I CARE?
DID YOU INTERRUPT A GAME
AT CHURCH THE OTHER NIGHT?

WE WERE JUST WALKING BY.

STABBING A VOLLEYBALL
ISN'T JUST WALKING BY.

WHATEVER.

COLTON, YOU HAVE
TO CLEAN UP YOUR ACT.

THAT'S ORIGINAL.

YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING LATELY.

NOT SCHOOL, YOUR FRIENDS.

I LIKE MY FRIENDS.

SO MUCH THAT YOU LIKE
TO GET THEM IN TROUBLE?

ARE YOU BLAMING ME?
THAT'S SUPPORTIVE.

THAT'S NOT BLAME.
IT'S RESPONSIBILITY.

"RESPONSIBILITY."

HOW ABOUT YOU WAIT A YEAR?

THEN WHEN I'M 18, I CAN BE
RESPONSIBLE ALL ON MY OWN.

DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
WE'RE NOT PUSHING YOU OUT.

WE JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST --

BEST FOR ME?

ARE WE DONE YET?

YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO PREPARE FOR A MISSION.

[ SCOFFS ]
GOT TO RUN, MOM.

I'D HATE TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

HEY, COACH.

HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

YOU READY
FOR TOMORROW'S MATCH?

YEAH.

GOOD.

YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT CLAIRVILLE, AREN'T YOU?

AM I THAT TRANSPARENT?

LOOK,
STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT.

IT'S NOT TILL THE END
OF THE SEASON.

I KNOW.

YOU'RE GONNA PSYCHE YOURSELF OUT
AND MAKE IT WORSE.

AND BY "IT,"
YOU MEAN MY GAME?

NO, BY "IT,"
I MEAN YOUR PARANOIA.

HEY.

LOOK, JUST PLAY YOUR BEST.

IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT'S AT STAKE.

EXCEPT IT DOES.

I HEARD THAT.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S WARM UP.

THIS IS GONNA BE SWEET.

DUDE, CHILL OUT.
IT'S JUST A PARTY.

HEY, YOUR PARENTS
CALLED MINE.

YEAH, THEY CORNERED ME
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
DID YOU?

WELL, YEAH.
THEY ASKED ME WHERE I WAS.

LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

YOU DON'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.
MAKE SOMETHING UP. LIE.

I DON'T CARE.

WHAT WE DO IS OUR BUSINESS,
NOT THEIRS.

[ CELLPHONE RINGING ]

[ BEEP ]

HEY, BLAKE.
I'M ON MY WAY.

YEAH, EDDIE'S WITH ME.

[ BEEPING ]

HEY, JUST A SECOND.

IT WAS NOBODY.

HEY, I'M GONNA BE THERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

DON'T START WITHOUT ME.

[ CELLPHONE RINGS ]

[ SIGHS ] YEAH?

YOU'RE COMING TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

TO WHAT?

YOUR SISTER'S TENNIS GAME.

IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

HERS IS THE FIRST GAME.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY
ALL NIGHT.
Mom, I already --

Listen, you told Ashley
you'd be there.

NOW, BE HOME IN 30 MINUTES.

FINE. I'M COMING.

Try not to be late.

WHATEVER.

[ BEEP ]

[ SIGHS ]

OH, I AM SORRY, HONEY.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

KAREN IS SICK, AND THERE ISN'T
ANYBODY TO COVER THE DESK.

MOM, I KNOW.
I GET IT.

I REALLY WANTED
TO BE THERE.

I KNOW.
I'LL BE FINE.

GOOD LUCK.

[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

COLTON?

I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS WORSE --

IF HE WERE HERE
AND HE DIDN'T COME

OR THAT HE'S NOT HERE
AT ALL.

YOU READY?
YEP.

I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT COLTON DID.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

WHAT CAN WE DO ANYMORE?

I MEAN, HIS FRIENDS AREN'T
A GOOD INFLUENCE.

OR MAYBE HE'S NOT A GOOD
INFLUENCE ON HIS FRIENDS.

GO!

WHOO!

SOUNDS LIKE HE'S LOST SIGHT
OF WHAT'S RIGHT.

IT'S BEEN MONTHS SINCE HE'S EVEN
BEEN TO CHURCH.

HE GETS SO CONFRONTATIONAL
WHEN WE EVEN BRING IT UP.

HE EVEN MAKES FUN OF THE KIDS
THAT DO GO TO CHURCH.

OH, HE'S JUST SO CONSUMED
WITH HIMSELF.

WE'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR HIM.

TRYING TO LISTEN, UNDERSTAND,
DISCIPLINE, ANYTHING.

BUT HE JUST DOESN'T CARE.

WE'D HOPED HE'D OUTGROW
THIS BEHAVIOR.

INSTEAD,
IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE.

MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN STILL DO.

I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
THE STORY OF ALMA THE YOUNGER.

HE WAS PERSECUTING MEMBERS
OF THE CHURCH,

EVEN LEADING
SOME OF THEM AWAY.

UNTIL THE LORD INTERVENED.
VERSE 14 TELLS US WHY.

"BEHOLD THE LORD HATH HEARD
THE PRAYERS OF HIS PEOPLE

"AND ALSO THE PRAYERS
OF HIS SERVANT, ALMA,

"WHO IS THY FATHER.

"FOR HE HAS PRAYED
WITH MUCH FAITH CONCERNING THEE

THAT THOU MIGHTEST BE BROUGHT
TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH."

BUT WE'VE BEEN PRAYING
FOR OUR SON.

I KNOW.

BUT ALMA PRAYED THAT THE LORD
WOULD INTERVENE

IN HIS SON'S LIFE

TO SHOW HIM THE WRONG
IN ALL HE WAS DOING.

YOU CAN'T FORCE COLTON
TO CHANGE.

NO ONE CAN.

SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

FAST, AND PRAY THAT THE LORD
CAN TOUCH COLTON'S HEART,

SO COLTON WILL WANT
TO TURN TO THE LORD,

SO HE'LL WANT TO CHANGE.

HEY, EDDIE.
LET ME SEE YOUR CELLPHONE.

[ SCREAMING ]

OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN, AS WE COME
BEFORE THEE THIS TIME.

ENJOY.

HEY, WE NEED MORE DRINKS,
AND, BLAKE, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

YOU'RE SO RIGHT.
COLTON. COLTON.

GOOD GAME.

Hi, this is Jennifer.
Please leave a message.

HEY, MOM.

UH, I KNOW
YOU'RE STILL WORKING,

BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT...I WON!

COACH MILLER STILL THINKS
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO WORK ON

BEFORE THE WHOLE
CLAIRVILLE THING.

ANYWAY, I WILL TALK TO YOU
WHEN I GET HOME,

AND HAVE FUN AT WORK.
OKAY? BYE.

WHOO!

HA HA.

MAN, BE CAREFUL.
WATCH YOUR DRIVING.

UH, COLTON?

YEAH?

I NEED -- OHH.

DUDE, WATCH THE ROAD, MAN.
WATCH THE ROAD.

[ INSPIRATIONAL ROCK MUSIC
PLAYING ]

YOU JUST TOOK THAT TURN
TOO FAST.

YEAH.

DUDE, WATCH THE ROAD!

[ TIRES SCREECHING ]

BLAKE!

[ GLASS SHATTERS ]

[ SIREN WAILS ]

LATE TEENS. HE CALLED IT
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

ARE THERE MORE?
RIGHT BEHIND US.

Dr. Pepper: TELL ME.

HEAD-ON COLLISION
WITH ANOTHER CAR.

NO SEATBELTS ON THIS ONE.

WAS HE DRIVING?

NO.

WHERE'S THE DRIVER?

LET'S SEND THIS ONE UP
FOR A HEAD C.T.

Woman: YES, DOCTOR.

ANY OTHER INJURIES?

NO OPEN WOUNDS,
NOTHING CRITICAL.

HIS SHOULDER
LOOKS OUT OF PLACE, THOUGH.

HOW IS SHE?

IN AND OUT
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

X-RAYS?

[ GASPING ]

[ FLATLINE ]
Man: DOCTOR!

WE'RE LOSING HIM.
NO PULSE.

GONNA DEFIBRILLATE..

AND CLEAR.

CHARGING.

AND CLEAR!

GOING TO 360.

AND CLEAR!

AGAIN?

NO, HE'S GONE.

SHOULD WE CALL IT?

MARK IT TIME OF DEATH,
10:32 P.M.

[ GASPING ]

DOCTOR, HE'S BACK!

WATCH HIS VITALS.
UPDATES EVERY 15 SECONDS.

I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM AGAIN.

[ BIRDS CHIRPING ]

OH, MY GOSH, COLTON.

WHERE...

YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

HOW LONG?

A FEW DAYS.

AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
YOU WERE KIND OF OUT OF IT.

THE DOCTORS
KEPT YOU SEDATED.

I'LL GO GET MOM AND DAD.

YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT

IF YOU GOT HURT OR DIED
OR SOMETHING, I WOULDN'T CARE,

BECAUSE YOU COULD BE
SUCH A JERK,

BUT I HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL
SINCE THE ACCIDENT.

I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

COLTON.

OH, HONEY.
WE THOUGHT WE LOST YOU.

DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED?

YEAH.

WHAT'S IT LIKE
BEING DEAD?

ASHLEY.

YOU STOPPED BREATHING.

THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD
TO BRING YOU BACK,

BUT NOTHING WAS WORKING.

AND THEN YOU JUST CAME BACK
ON YOUR OWN.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAR
WE HIT?

THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THE VEHICLE.

SHE GOT HURT, BUT...

IT'S SARA TAYLOR.

LET'S LET COLTON REST.

CAN I HAVE LIZ AND DALLEN
COME SEE ME?

ABSOLUTELY.
SURE.

HI, SARA.
I'M DR. PEPPER.

I'VE [CHUCKLES] I'VE HEARD
ALL THE JOKES, TOO.

YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A BIT
OF A TRAUMA, HAVEN'T YOU?

YEAH, BUT I'LL BE ABLE
TO RECOVER, THOUGH, RIGHT?

OF COURSE.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

YOU HURT YOUR KNEE
IN THE WRECK.

SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR ME?

WELL, IT MEANS YOU NEED
TO TAKE IT EASY.

WHAT?

WELL, SARA --

WHAT ABOUT TENNIS?

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS FOR YOU TO GET BETTER.

IT WILL AFFECT YOU, YES.

HOW MUCH?

WE'VE GOT YOU SCHEDULED
FOR SURGERY ON YOUR KNEE.

THE REST IS PRETTY MINOR.

I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
JUST HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

MAYBE YOU COULD FOCUS
ON ANOTHER HOBBY FOR A WHILE,

JUST UNTIL YOU GET BETTER.

SARA?

[ SNIFFLES ]

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WERE OKAY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

PROBABLY NOT.

Ow.

SARA.

JUST GET OUT.

I JUST --

JUST WHAT?
JUST WANTED TO RUIN MY LIFE?

NO.

PLEASE, LET ME EXPLAIN.

[ BEEP ]

IS EVERYTHING OKAY, SARA?

NO. PLEASE GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

LET'S GET YOU
BACK TO YOUR ROOM.

COME ON.

â™ª DON'T YOU WANT SOMEONE
FOR YOUR OWN? â™ª

â™ª SOMEONE YOU CAN TALK TO,
BABY â™ª

I KNOW YOU'RE FAKING.

HOW COULD YOU TELL?

I'M THE BEST SLEEP FAKER
IN THE WORLD.

IT'S ALL ABOUT
HOW YOU BREATHE.

GOOD TO KNOW.

SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

IT'S KIND OF BORING.

JUST THINKING.

ABOUT WHAT?

YOU KNOW ALL THOSE DREAMS
AND VISIONS

THAT THEY HAVE
IN THE SCRIPTURES?

UM, YEAH, I GUESS.

DO YOU THINK ANY OF THAT STUFF
STILL HAPPENS?

YEAH. WHY?

JUST WONDERING.

COME ON, WHY?

HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

DAD BROUGHT ME.

WHERE IS HE?

SARA'S GOING INTO SURGERY.
DAD'S GIVING HER A BLESSING.

ARE YOU READY?

DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

THE OPERATION WILL BE
JUST FINE.

YOU WON'T FEEL A THING
DURING IT.

JUST RELAX.

THE DOCTOR SAID WE CAN TAKE
COLTON HOME TOMORROW.

GOOD.

HE'S QUIET.

IS HE --

DID EVERYTHING HAPPEN
WITH THE ACCIDENT AND ALL

BECAUSE OF OUR PRAYERS?

I DON'T KNOW.

I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HOW
IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

AT LEAST HE'S OUT
OF DANGER.

I WAS JUST SO AFRAID
WE'D LOSE HIM.

MAYBE HE'S GOT
A SECOND CHANCE.

SARA?

THE NURSE SAID YOU'D BE OUT
FOR A WHILE.

I KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY HEAR ME,
BUT...THAT'S OKAY.

I JUST NEED TO TALK.

DID --
DID YOU KNOW I DIED?

WHEN THEY WERE
BRINGING ME IN.

JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT,
THEY SAID.

WOW.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

IT'S -- IT'S HARDER TO SAY
OUT LOUD.

UM...

IT FELT LONGER TO ME.

SOMEONE...

SOMEONE WAS WITH ME.

TALKING TO ME.
WARNING ME.

I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
WHEN I WAS DEAD

OR OUT OF IT OR WHAT.

HE, UH...

HE SAID TO STOP
WHAT I WAS DOING --

ALL THE BAD STUFF.

I SAW EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER DONE WRONG...

...AND IT'S EATING ME
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

MAYBE --
MAYBE IT WAS A DREAM.

OH, BUT IT FELT SO REAL.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TALK TO.

I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.

SO WHO ELSE WOULD?

I HOPE YOU GET BETTER, SARA.

SOON.

[ INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY ]

OW.

OH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I STILL NEED TO GET
THAT PRESCRIPTION.

[ SIGHS ]
I'M OKAY.

[ SIGHS ]

OH, LIZ AND DALLEN CALLED.

UH, THEY WANT TO COME BY
AND VISIT LATER

IF YOU'RE FEELING UP TO IT.

HEY, GUYS.
HEY.

DUDE, YOU BACK ALREADY?

I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ABLE
TO BLOW OFF SOME SCHOOL.

YEAH, I FIGURED
I'D COME BACK ANYWAY.

BETTER TO BE HERE
THAN AROUND YOUR MOM.

NO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET
ANY FURTHER BEHIND.

Eddie:
JUST LET ME BORROW IT.
Boy: NO.

COME ON.

NO.
DUDE, GIVE IT TO ME.

GOT IT.

OH, DUDE.
GOOD JOB.

WHAT'S THAT?

PAPER FOR ENGLISH.

Blake: SO, GET THIS.

MY MOM WANTED TO TRY
TO CRACK DOWN.

YOU KNOW,
TRY TO GROUND ME.

LIKE LOSING MY LICENSE
WASN'T BAD ENOUGH.

HEY. WE'RE GOING
TO A PARTY TONIGHT.

THERE'S GONNA BE TONS
OF GIRLS.

I'D BETTER NOT COME.
MY ARM.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

THE ARM COULD TOTALLY WIN YOU
SOME SYMPATHY POINTS, MAN.

HEY, DID YOU GUYS HEAR
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE E.R.?

YOU MEAN ABOUT BLAKE?

OH, YEAH, DUDE. I HEARD YOU
HURLED ALL OVER A NURSE.

[ BELL RINGING ]

SEE YOU.

HEY, MAN. YOU'RE NOT GOING
TONIGHT, ARE YOU?

THE PARTY? YEAH.

MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T.

I MEAN, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.

I WON'T DRIVE.

MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
GO ANYWAY.

ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT, DUDE?

ALL READY?

SHOULD WE ASK COLTON
IF HE WANTS TO COME?

DO YOU THINK DAD WOULD MIND
IF I BORROWED A TIE?

WHAT?

[ BIRDS CHIRPING ]

WE HAD THAT LAST WEEK.
HOW ABOUT LASAGNA?

GREAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

I'M STARVING.

WOULD YOU LIKE HELP?

SURE.
YOU CAN SET THE TABLE.

OKAY.

HERE.

THANKS.

TELL ME ABOUT CHURCH.
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING NEW?

WE TALKED ABOUT SINS
AND HOW TO REPENT AND ALL.

THAT'S GOOD.

YEAH. I MEAN,
IT WAS PRETTY BASIC.

MAKING SURE YOU PRAY

AND MAKING UP FOR ALL THE THINGS
YOU'VE DONE WRONG.

IT WAS OKAY.

COLTON.

OH, SORRY.

HEY.

COULD I COME IN?

[ CHUCKLES ]
DON'T WE LOOK COOL?

HOW YOU FEELING?

I'M FINE.

OKAY.

I SAW YOU AT CHURCH
ON SUNDAY.

YEAH. MAKES TWO WEEKS
IN A ROW.

ARE YOU GOING FOR A MEDAL?

NO.

I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

I HEARD THAT YOU GOT OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL,

BUT I HADN'T SEEN YOU
AT SCHOOL, SO I --

I'M GOING BACK THIS WEEK.

OH.

I, UH...

I GUESS I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT...

I'M SORRY...

...ABOUT WHAT I DID TO YOU.

WERE YOU REALLY TOLD TO STOP
WHAT YOU WERE DOING...

WHEN YOU DIED, OR WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO CALL IT?

WAS THAT TRUE?

YOU HEARD.

YOU WERE TALKING TO ME.

[ Chuckling ]
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

YEAH. IT'S TRUE.
OR AT LEAST I THINK IT IS.

SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE NOW?

I'M -- I'M NOT SURE
WHAT TO DO.

AND -- AND I FEEL BAD

ABOUT EVERYTHING.

ESPECIALLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU.

SO, YOU'RE APOLOGIZING?

UH, NO. YES.

UM, I MEAN, I JUST --

[ SIGHS ]

IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

IT'S WEIRD NOW
WITH MY PARENTS...

AND MY FRIENDS --

THEY DON'T GET THIS?

THEY WON'T TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY.

THANK YOU...

FOR YOUR APOLOGY.

WHAT? REALLY?

WOW. UM,
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO --

FORGIVE YOU?

I'M NOT SURE I'M THERE YET,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING,

AND AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT
BEING A JERK.

FEEL BETTER?

YEAH.

I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S
THE ONLY REASON I CAME OVER.

I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK THAT.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE IT RIGHT
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

I MEAN, NO OFFENSE, BUT I'M SURE
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

DALLEN.
HEY, DALLEN!

WAIT UP.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

DID I MISS SOMETHING?

IS THE END
OF THE WORLD HERE?

I'M SERIOUS.

THE ONLY THING YOU'VE EVER
BEEN SERIOUS ABOUT

IS MAKING EVERYBODY ELSE
MISERABLE.

FINE. WHATEVER.
LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.

HEY, I --
I MADE FUN OF YOU

AND EMBARRASSED YOU IN FRONT
OF EVERYONE.

GREAT APOLOGY.

WELL, YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO BE NICE.

YOU DIDN'T DESERVE
WHAT I DID TO YOU.

I DON'T BUY IT.

HEY, DALLEN, WAIT.

I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

DO YOU THINK SORRY
REALLY COVERS IT?

WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
YOU REALLY HURT, LIKE SARA?

YOU KNOW, SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO PLAY TENNIS

FOR THE REST
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

LIZ SAYS THAT'S JUST ENOUGH
TO MISS A CHANCE

AT THIS ELITE TENNIS PROGRAM
THIS SUMMER.

IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE.

YOU CAN BE SORRY TODAY

AND JUST BE BACK T-T-TO
TORMENTING EVERYONE TOMORROW.

HEY, GUYS.

WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
YOU COMING?

I BETTER NOT.

WHAT?
MY ARM.

I'D JUST SLOW YOU DOWN.

WHATEVER, DUDE.

SURE.

HEY, EDDIE.
WHAT'S UP?

DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE GOING
WITH THOSE GUYS?

WHAT?

BLAKE AND JOHN.
THEY CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS.

THEY'RE NOT
THE BEST FRIENDS.

HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT A TERRIBLE
PERSON I WAS

WHEN I WAS AROUND THEM.

HEY, I'M PART OF THE GROUP.
I'M ACCEPTED.

DO YOU GET THAT?

I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED,

AND I KNOW I DRAGGED YOU
INTO IT, BUT IT WAS STUPID.

WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, DUDE?

YOU STILL HAVE TIME
TO GET BETTER FRIENDS.

SARA TAYLOR, OR DALLEN,
LIZ, ANYONE.

I HAVE FRIENDS,
AND SO DO YOU.

AND TO SHOW YOU HOW GOOD
OF A FRIEND I AM,

I'M GONNA FORGET YOU SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

MOM, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

WE ARE NOT. I CAN GET US THERE
IN EIGHT MINUTES.

ALIVE? I'D HATE TO GET TO
THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST OFFICE

IN MORE PIECES
THAN LAST WEEK.

HI, COLTON.

OKAY, I'M GONNA GRAB MY PURSE
AND LOCK UP.

I THINK I GOT WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT.

WHAT?

IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT APOLOGIZING.

THOUGH THAT'S IMPORTANT,
YOU GOT TO DO MORE.

AND YOU GOT ALL THIS
FROM ME?

WELL, YOU AND DALLEN AND...

READING MY SCRIPTURES.

I HAVE TO MAKE AMENDS.

OKAY.

WHICH GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT YOU...

COLTON.

...AND DECIDING I WANTED TO HELP
YOU GET BETTER.

IS THIS YOUR PENANCE?

THIS IS A REALLY
GOOD RACKET.

YEAH, IT BETTER BE,

'CAUSE IF THAT SALES GUY
RIPPED ME OFF.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

I WANT TO.

I KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN
THE BEST OF FRIENDS,

AND I KNOW
IT'S MOSTLY MY FAULT,

BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE
TO SPOIL YOUR DREAM.

BUT HOW CAN YOU HELP?

I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT MUCH BETTER OFF.

THIS WILL HEAL
IN A FEW WEEKS.

DON'T FORGET,
I PLAY HOCKEY.

THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO TENNIS.

YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

YEAH.

ALL RIGHT.

REALLY?

YEAH. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
COMING IN

FROM THE CLAIRVILLE
TENNIS PROGRAM.

YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

WELL, I WANT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH
FOR THEM WHEN THEY COME,

AND RIGHT NOW, MY LEG'S
FEELING PRETTY USELESS.

WELL, WE'LL WORK ON THAT.

UH, HEY.

THERE'S A YOUTH ACTIVITY
TOMORROW.

OKAY.

YOU SHOULD COME.
IT'LL BE FUN.

I DON'T THINK ANYONE
WOULD WANT ME THERE.

I DO.

YOU READY, SARA?

I GOT TO RUN.

WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

GOT IT.

YOU CAME.

AND I'M WONDERING WHY.

WE CAN'T EVEN PLAY.

WELL, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON
WHY I COME.

WHY DO YOU COME THEN?

TO BE WITH MY FRIENDS.

YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE
I CAN BE MYSELF AROUND.

SO, WHAT, WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO SIT HERE

AND WATCH EVERYONE ELSE
HAVE A GOOD TIME?

WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING

TO ENJOY IT, DO YOU?

OKAY.

GET IT, GET IT, GET IT.

I'M NOT FEELING IT.

IT'S LIKE A HOCKEY GAME.

YOU CAN WATCH WITHOUT PLAYING
AND STILL LOVE IT.

HOCKEY'S ABOUT WINNING.

ALL THE ICE
AND THE ADRENALINE...

AND WINNING.

SO, WINNING
IS ALL THAT MATTERS?

PEOPLE CHEERING YOU ON?

GETTING CARRIED OFF
ON PEOPLE'S SHOULDERS?

YEAH.

NOT THIS SEASON.

SORRY, BUT IT'S THE GLORY
YOU LIKE.

SO?

ALL RIGHT,
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

WHY IS IT
THAT WHEN YOU WIN,

YOU GET CARRIED OFF
ON PEOPLE'S SHOULDERS,

BUT WHEN YOU LOSE,
YOU BLAME YOUR TEAM?

WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR
GLORIFIED PING PONG?

[ CHUCKLES ]

TENNIS IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

IT'S JUST ME
AND MY OPPONENT,

AND I CAN'T BLAME ANYONE
FOR MY MISTAKES,

AND WHEN I WIN,
I CAN BE PROUD OF MYSELF.

SEE?

WITHOUT GLOATING.

[ BELL RINGS ]

COLTON.
HEY, GUYS.

HEY, NO SLING.

YEAH. I JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE DOCTOR.

LET'S GO CELEBRATE, MAN.

I CAN'T.
I GOT TO GO TO CLASS.

WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CLASS.

GUYS! STOP!

ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT, MAN?

I FEEL FINE.
I JUST CAN'T COME.

YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT TO US
A LOT LATELY.

SO?

SO, ARE YOU EVEN
OUR FRIEND ANYMORE?

OF COURSE I AM.

SURE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

YOU'VE GONE REALLY GOOD-BOY-LIKE
ON US, MAN.

IS THAT A BAD THING?

YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE REST
OF THEM?

FINE.

WHEN YOU SNAP OUT
OF THIS LITTLE HAZE

YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
COME FIND US.

I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

HEY, AMY.

HEY.

HEY, MIKE.

HEY.

YOU HERE TO START
WORKING AGAIN?

NOT EXACTLY.

I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D WANT ME BACK.

JUST, UH, THOUGHT YOU'D STOP BY
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

IT'S ABOUT $500.

WHAT FOR?

IT'S WHAT I OWE YOU,
PLUS INTEREST.

UM, ABOUT ONCE A --
ONCE A SHIFT,

I'D TAKE THE MONEY
AND POCKET IT.

IT NEVER MADE IT
TO THE MACHINE.

I STOLE IT.

I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

AND I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT...

I'M SORRY.

I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS.

WELL, THANKS FOR BEING COOL
ABOUT IT.

I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

UH, PRAYING.

SORRY. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
KNEEL BEFORE.

IT'S BETTER WHEN I KNEEL.

HEY. ASHLEY.

I -- I OWE YOU
SOME MONEY.

WHY?

BECAUSE I KIND OF TOOK IT
FROM YOUR ROOM.

HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I KEEP IT?

IN THE JEWELRY BOX?
KIND OF OBVIOUS.

COLTON.

I'D PAY YOU BACK NOW,
BUT I'M KIND OF SHORT ON CASH.

HOW DID I NOT NOTICE?

I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KEEP A LOT IN THERE.

YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING
A BANK ACCOUNT.

I WILL NOW.

I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

YOU BETTER.

FINALLY.

YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LITTLE

I ALWAYS THOUGHT CRUTCHES
WERE SO COOL.

ARE YOU GLAD YOU DON'T NEED
THEM ANYMORE?

THIS IS WEIRD.

WHAT?

HAVE I ALWAYS BEEN
THIS PASTY?

[ LAUGHS ]

YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO TAKE IT EASY.

I'M NOT THAT CRAZY ABOUT YOU
GETTING BACK INTO TENNIS YET.

WHY NOT?

DR. PEPPER SAID
THAT I CAN EASE INTO IT.

NO, WHAT HE SAID IS YOU CAN BE
MORE ACTIVE OVERALL,

AND YOUR KNEE
IS STILL SENSITIVE.

WELL, DON'T WORRY.

I MEAN, COLTON'S HELPING ME,
AND I WON'T OVERDO IT.

SO, UM...

DO YOU THINK COLTON WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN SO, NOT BAD, BUT...

BAD?
YEAH.

IF I HADN'T TOLD ON HIM --

I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN HE STARTED
GETTING REALLY MEAN TO EVERYONE.

I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS HIS CHOICE EITHER WAY.

YOU KNOW,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

WOW. HAVEN'T SEEN THIS
IN A WHILE.

YEAH.

FIGURED MY GRADES
COULDN'T GET MUCH WORSE.

I'M GLAD YOU'RE AT LEAST
MAKING AN EFFORT NOW.

YOU KNOW,
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,

YOUR MOM AND I ARE HERE
FOR YOU.

YEAH, I KNOW.

YOU KNOW, I'VE NOTICED SOME
CHANGES IN YOU SINCE THE WRECK.

I'M PROUD OF YOU.

JOINING THE PANSY SPORT,
ARE WE, COLTON?

AW, HOW NICE FOR SARA.

SHUT UP, BLAKE.

WHATEVER, MAN.

YOU OKAY?

I'M USED TO IGNORING THEM.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

NEW DEVELOPMENT.

THAT'S HARD.
I MEAN, THEY WERE YOUR FRIENDS.

THEY STILL ARE.

IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T LIKE
WHAT THEY DO ANYMORE.

IT'S PARTIALLY
MY FAULT, THOUGH.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

COME ON, YOU KNOW
HOW I USED TO ACT.

YEAH, BUT THEY ACTED
THE SAME WAY.

I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU FORCED
THEM TO DO ANYTHING.

WELL, BLAKE AND JOHN, MAYBE,
BUT EDDIE.

OH.

YEAH, I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET THROUGH TO HIM.

WOW. I TOTALLY SOUND
LIKE MY PARENTS.

FRIGHTENING.
YEAH.

ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT EDDIE
TO BE LIKE ME.

CAN I ASK A FAVOR?

YEAH, SURE.

IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS
HOW TO HELP HIM,

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

WELL, YEAH.

I DON'T KNOW ANY RIGHT NOW,
BUT I CAN THINK ABOUT IT.

THANKS.

NO PROBLEM.

MAYBE WITH BOTH OF US,

HE'LL SEE WE JUST
WANT TO BE HIS FRIEND.

SO, I THINK
COACH MILLER'S WORRIED

THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE READY
FOR CLAIRVILLE.

LET'S GET WORKING.

[ INTRO TO TOMMY DALTON'S
"DON'T LOOK DOWN" PLAYS ]

â™ª I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS â™ª

â™ª IF THE WORLD GOES AWAY â™ª

â™ª WE'D ALL JUST BE ANGELS â™ª

â™ª WITH NO ONE TO SAVE â™ª

â™ª AND I CAN'T LET THIS MOMENT â™ª

â™ª SLIP RIGHT THROUGH MY HANDS â™ª

â™ª JUST NEED YOU TO KNOW ME â™ª

â™ª THEN YOU'D UNDERSTAND â™ª

HEY.

HEY.

WHAT ARE YOU READING?

FACTS.

â™ª YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
IMPOSSIBLE â™ª

â™ª SO, WHY CAN'T I SAY? â™ª

HEY, CUTIE.

[ LAUGHTER ]

GOOD JOB.

I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THAT WAS EXCELLENT.

HAVE YOU EVER
WATCHED TENNIS?

SO, HOW'S THE WHOLE
YOU-CHANGING THING GOING?

IT'S OKAY, I GUESS.
IT'S NOT VERY EASY.

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.

YEAH.

DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

A LITTLE.

AT LEAST I DON'T FEEL LIKE
EVERYONE HATES ME NOW.

EXCEPT FOR MAYBE JOHN,
BLAKE, AND EDDIE.

AND THEY MIGHT NOT
EVER GET WHY.

YEAH.

SO, WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

WHEN YOU DIED?

YOU SOUND LIKE MY SISTER.

WELL, NOT DYING,
BUT THE WHOLE VISION THING.

IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

I JUST WANTED TO DIE...

OR HIDE FOREVER.

I KEPT HEARING WARNINGS.

IT WAS LIKE BEING TOLD
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE WRONG.

NOT LIKE YOUR PARENTS
LECTURE YOU, BUT SERIOUS.

AND I REALIZED EVERYONE
WHO I'D HURT.

MY PARENTS, ASHLEY, YOU,

ANYONE WHO I HAD
EVER BULLIED.

AND...I KNEW IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND

WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING
THE WHOLE TIME.

WHEN I WOKE UP,
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

YOU HAVE CHANGED, YOU KNOW?

YEAH.
I CAN FEEL IT.

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I LIKE IT -- THE NEW YOU.

Colton: DALLEN.

SARA. SARA.

RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT HERE.

I'LL GET IT.

NICE THROW.

I GUESS I HAVE TOO MUCH STRENGTH
IN MY ARM.

YEAH, THAT'S IT.

OKAY, SO MAYBE I'LL STICK
TO TENNIS THEN.

HEY, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT FRISBEE.

THANK YOU.
YEAH, RIGHT.

OH, HEY!

Ashley: JUST GIVE IT!

I DON'T HAVE IT.

GIVE IT BACK.

Colton: HEY.

YOU HAVING FUN, MAN?

WE WERE. YOU OKAY?

THEY WON'T GIVE
THE FRISBEE BACK.

[ Mockingly ] THEY WON'T GIVE
THE FRISBEE BACK.

MAN, CUT IT OUT!

YOU WANT THIS?
YEAH.

YEAH?

THEN GO GET IT.

I GUESS YOU GUYS
DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

OH, YOU'RE
INVITING US, NOW?

NO, WE'LL LEAVE THE CHURCHES
TO YOU, MAN.

HEY. EDDIE.

WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

OPPORTUNITY. THEY CAN TURN
ANY SITUATION INTO TROUBLE.

[ SIGHS ]
I'LL GET THE FRISBEE.

COME ON.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

YOU'RE RUSTY.

THANKS.

COME ON,
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

HOW'S YOUR KNEE FEEL?

IT'S GOOD.

I'VE BEEN RUNNING AND GETTING
BACK INTO SHAPE.

YOU'RE FAVORING IT.

I KNOW.

ARE YOU REALLY READY
FOR A MATCH?

YEAH.

HEY, MOM.

WELL, WHO IS THIS YOUNG MAN
IN MY KITCHEN?

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

I JUST GOT BACK
FROM CHURCH.
OH?

TALKED TO THE BISHOP.

HE SAYS I COULD BE ORDAINED
A PRIEST.

I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

YEAH.

YOU DON'T SEEM EXCITED.

I AM...

I GUESS.

IT'S JUST THAT
IT STILL BOTHERS ME.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

EVERYTHING I'VE DONE WRONG.

YOU STILL FEEL GUILTY?

YEAH.

DOES IT EVER GO AWAY?

SOMETIMES THE HARDEST THING
IS TO FORGIVE YOURSELF.

HOW DO YOU DO IT?

IT TAKES TIME.

IT'S HARD
TO COMPLETELY FORGET,

BUT ONE MORNING
YOU'LL WAKE UP,

AND AT LEAST THE MEMORY
WON'T HURT ANYMORE.

YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

YEAH.

THANKS.

EDDIE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

WELL, WE'RE HEADED
THE SAME DIRECTION.

I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
WALK TOGETHER.

WHATEVER.

ARE YOU IN A HURRY?

YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

NO.

SO, UH, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AT CHURCH FOR A WHILE.

"WE"?

EVER NOTICE HOW IT'S ALWAYS
"WE" HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AT CHURCH?

IT'S A DEAD GIVEAWAY
THAT YOU'RE SENT TO "SAVE" ME.

OKAY.

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

BUT IT DOESN'T LESSEN
THE FACT THAT WE --

I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MORE.

ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

WHAT?

SAVE IT FOR COLTON.

HEY!

LOOK, WE JUST --

I MEAN, COLTON AND I, WE JUST
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

DO YOU EVEN REALLY
KNOW COLTON?
WELL, YEAH.

'CAUSE HE'S NOT ALL CHURCHY
LIKE YOU THINK.

HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT YOU.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I'VE SEEN HIM GET ALL CHURCHY
ON GIRLS BEFORE.

IT'S AN ACT.

10 MINUTES LATER
HE'S MAKING OUT WITH THEM.

NEXT DAY HE DOESN'T
EVEN SAY HI.

HE'S NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE,

AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
LIKE THAT EITHER.

SAVE IT.

ARE YOU EVEN HAPPY
WITH WHO YOU ARE?

ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

NOT BY MAKING A FOOL
OF MYSELF.

YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO DO
SOMETHING I'M GOOD AT.

ARE YOU FEELING
A LITTLE HUMBLED?

EMBARRASSED.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

ALL RIGHT. WELL,
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

I, UH, TAKE IT
YOU MISS THIS.

WHY WOULDN'T I?
COME ON.

[ LAUGHS ]

YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'D FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THESE.

BUT THE BLADE'S SHORTER.
SO?

WELL, I ALWAYS
KIND OF FIGURED

THAT A LONGER BLADE WOULD,
YOU KNOW, HELP ME -- WHOA!

KEEP MY BALANCE.

SO, YOUR GAME'S COMING UP.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

NERVOUS.

NERVOUS?
WELL, YOU'VE IMPROVED.

YOU HAVE.

THANKS, BUT I'LL FEEL BETTER
WHEN IT'S OVER.

ARE YOU DREADING TENNIS?

NEVER.

SO, UM, I SAW EDDIE
THE OTHER DAY.

REALLY?

YEAH,
AND HE SEEMS PRETTY SET.

WELL, LISTENING WAS NEVER
OUR STRONG POINT.

"OUR"?

I SPEAK FOR
THE COLLECTIVE REBELS.

OH.

BUT, YOU KNOW,

I THINK HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING ISN'T RIGHT.

SO DID I.

SO, THEN HOW DO WE MAKE HIM
WANT TO DO BETTER?

YOU SEE,
THE PROBLEM WITH EDDIE

IS THAT HIS WHOLE DREAM
WAS TO BE COOL.

WITH ME,
IT WAS JUST WHO I WAS.

OH.

SO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

UH-HUH.
BACKPEDAL FASTER.

HE JUST HAS TO REALIZE THAT WHAT
PEOPLE THINK ISN'T IMPORTANT.

WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD

THAT'S SOMETHING HE HAS
TO FIGURE OUT FOR HIMSELF.

YEAH.
MAYBE WE COULD JUST --

WHOA! [ LAUGHS ]

WHAT HAPPENED?

MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
MY SKATES INSTEAD.

MORNING.
HEY.

HOW'S YOUR KNEE FEEL?

I DON'T HAVE TO SERVE
WITH MY KNEE.

WHAT TIME'S
YOUR GAME START?

YOU'RE COMING?
I'M NOT GONNA MISS THIS ONE.

5:00.

YOU BETTER HURRY.
SCHOOL STARTS IN 15 MINUTES.

HEY, I GOT TO RUN BEFORE
YOUR GAME, BUT I'LL BE BACK.

OKAY.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE COMING.

NERVOUS?
YEAH.

IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I PLAYED A GAME

THAT MATTERS SO MUCH TO ME.

YOU'LL DO FINE.
THANKS.

YOU KNOW, I'M AS NERVOUS
AS MY FIRST HIGH SCHOOL MATCH.

TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
HEY, EDDIE.

QUIT BUGGING ME.

HEY, I JUST WANT TO TALK.

BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
YOU HAPPY?

I'M TRYING TO HELP.

SURE YOU ARE.

JUST BE CAREFUL.

BLAKE AND JOHN HAVE A WEIRD
SENSE OF FUN, LIKE I DID.

I'M NOT THE BEST
EXAMPLE HERE.

NO, YOU'RE NOT.

JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU'D REGRET.

I MEAN, IT'S NOT WORTH
WHAT THEY'LL THINK OF YOU.

YOU NEED SOMETHING,
COLTON?

DUDE, YOU ARE REALLY STARTING
TO BUG US, MAN.

YOU TRIED.

WE'LL KEEP TRYING.

SO, YOU READY FOR THIS?

I THINK SO.

GOOD. JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME. YOU CAN DO THIS.

[ INTRO TO METZENER'S

â™ª AND PASS THE PLACE WHERE

â™ª BUT IF YOU WON'T TALK

â™ª HOW CAN WE GET AROUND IT? â™ª

â™ª IF YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT IT â™ª

HEY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

JUST THOUGHT I'D SAY HI.

STILL THINKING
ABOUT YESTERDAY?

COACH MILLER SAID HE'D HELP ME
PRACTICE SOME MORE

IF I WANT TO KEEP TRYING
FOR THE CLAIRVILLE PROGRAM.

KEEP TRYING.
YOU COULD DO IT.

I THOUGHT I'D BE READY
YESTERDAY.

YOU WERE.

YOU GOT SCARED.

SCARED.

YEAH.

SHE STARTED TO DO WELL,
AND YOU TENSED UP.

YEAH, WELL, SHE GOT HARDER
TO BEAT ALL OF A SUDDEN.

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE EASY.

YOU PSYCHED YOURSELF OUT.

WELL, I CAN'T HELP THAT.

YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE
A LOT BETTER

IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WELL, MAYBE.

I MEAN, LOOK, COLTON,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

I KNOW.

AND, YOU KNOW,
I NEVER APOLOGIZED.

FOR WHAT?

FOR TELLING ON YOU
LAST YEAR.

IF I HADN'T, MAYBE THINGS
WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I'D PROBABLY STILL BE OUT THERE
DOING THINGS I SHOULDN'T.

BUT IF I'D HAVE FOUND
A BETTER WAY --

I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HUMILIATED YOU

IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.

BUT THAT'S PARTIALLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

WELL, HUMILIATED OR NOT,

I SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO CHANGE THEN.

YOU NEVER NEED TO APOLOGIZE
TO ME FOR ANYTHING.

YOUR AIM IS OFF.

THANKS.

YOU'RE GETTING BETTER.

HEY.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

CHEERING YOU ON.

YEAH!

THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
SOME EXTRA SUPPORT.

Dallen: GO, SARA!

WHOO-HOO!

Colton: GOOD WORK.

THANKS.

YEAH, YOU DID SO WELL.

I'M NOT THERE YET.

I WISH I HAD
YOUR SERVE, SARA.

AND AFTER THE GAME,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

YOU REALLY ARE GETTING
A LOT BETTER.

THANKS.

WELL, I GOT TO GO.
PAPER DUE TOMORROW.

OKAY, THANKS FOR COMING.

YEAH.
WE GOT TO GO, TOO.

YEAH, PROMISED MOM WE'D BE HOME
IN TIME FOR DINNER.

OKAY. ENJOY.

SEE YA.

I NEVER THOUGHT THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD BE SO...CHUMMY.

ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

HE'S CHANGED.
HE'S DIFFERENT NOW.

I KNOW.
EVERYONE'S NOTICED.

BUT I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD
LIKE HIM SO MUCH.

LIKE HIM?

WE'RE NOT DATING
OR ANYTHING.

DO YOU WANT TO BE?
IT'S COLTON.

YOU JUST SAID HE'S CHANGED.

YEAH, BUT -- WAIT, ARE YOU
ARGUING FOR OR AGAINST IT?

DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FEEL?

WELL, I GUESS I COULD SEE MYSELF
LIKING HIM.

WHAT? OKAY, YES. I'M DEFINITELY
ARGUING FOR, THEN.

COME ON.
THERE'S TOO MUCH HISTORY.

BAD BLOOD.

SOME HISTORY IS BETTER
THAN NO HISTORY.

WHY DO YOU THINK SO FEW
HIGH SCHOOL RELATIONSHIPS LAST?

OKAY, YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T HATE HIM ANYMORE,

AND I GUARANTEE
HE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH IT.

I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S TOO AWKWARD.

YEAH, KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT.

[ SIGHS ]

YOU KNOW,
IF TENNIS DOESN'T WORK OUT,

I THINK WE COULD TAKE ON
TRACK AND FIELD.

SHOULD WE START
TIMING OUR RUNS?

[ CHUCKLES ]
NO, I WANT TO STAY POSITIVE.

DON'T WORRY.

I THINK TENNIS
IS THE WAY FOR YOU.

DON'T BELIEVE ME?

IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT.

YOU KNOW,
I READ SOMETHING SOMEWHERE

THAT FEAR IS THE WORST THING
WE CAN DO OURSELVES.

I BELIEVE THAT.

DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE A STRONG PLAYER.

SO ARE MY OPPONENTS.

WELL, YEAH,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

SO WHEN THEY DO WELL,
DON'T GET SCARED.

I HATE THAT WORD.

GOOD. REMEMBER IT.

THANKS.

TELL YOU WHAT.

CELEBRATE?
THAT'S AWFULLY CONFIDENT.

DID YOU NOT HEAR A WORD
I JUST SAID?

OKAY, FINE.
WE'LL CELEBRATE.

IT'S A DATE.

IT WAS
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME.

AND MY LEG FEELS
REALLY STIFF TODAY.

OH, SARA, BREATHE.

MOM, I NEED TO DO GOOD.

YOU NEED TO HAVE FUN.

DO NOT WORRY
ABOUT CLAIRVILLE.

DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT WINNING.

JUST ENJOY YOURSELF.

[ CHUCKLES ]
SEE YOU THERE?

I'LL BE BEHIND YOU
IN A HALF AN HOUR.

OH, ARE YOU THIRSTY?

WHAT DO YOU WANT?
FROM YOU, NOTHING.

YEAH, BUT HOW ABOUT YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU DID WITH COLTON?

WHAT I DID?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

IT'S COLTON WHO CHANGED
FOR THE BETTER,

WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR YOU GUYS.

YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID,
SWEETIE?

Eddie: WE GET YOUR LITTLE
JUDGING COMMENTS.

THEY'RE NOT JUDGING.
I HAVE A GAME TO GET TO.

OH, REALLY?

IS THAT WHAT COLTON'S
BEEN HELPING YOU WITH?

YEAH. AND MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN
FROM THAT.

I THINK I WILL.
HEY!

WHAT? NO! WAIT, NO!

GUYS, NO!

STOP IT!

OHH.

[ LAUGHS ]

LET ME OUT!

THAT WILL GET
HIS ATTENTION.

THINK SHE'LL BE OKAY?

WHO CARES?

YOUR NEXT OPPONENT --

COACH MILLER?

HAVE YOU SEEN SARA?

SHE'S NOT HERE YET?

I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET.

SHE SAID SHE'D BE HERE
AT 4:00.

MAYBE SHE'S JUST
RUNNING LATE.

OPEN UP!

CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?!

HEY, COLTON.

UH, HEY.
HAVE YOU SEEN SARA?

SHE SHOULD BE HERE.
SHE LEFT BEFORE ME.

OKAY.

[ SIGHS ]

THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

HEY, THAT'S SARA'S!

OH, IS IT?

WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

FOUND IT.

WHERE'S SARA?

WHERE IS SHE?

IF YOU HURT HER.

DUDE, WE DIDN'T HURT HER.

SHE HAS A GAME ANY MINUTE.

STOP GOOFING OFF
AND TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

OR WHAT?

JUST DO IT.

WHAT,
NO THREATS?

WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO BOW DOWN
TO YOU AND YOUR WISHES?

NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP
BEING JERKS

AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

DUDE, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

BUT THIS IS NOT COOL.

AND YOU KNOW IT!

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

NEED HIT IN THE HEAD
A LITTLE BIT?

SLAP THINGS BACK
INTO PLACE?

DO YOU NOT GET
THAT WE WERE DRUNK?!

WE COULD HAVE KILLED
SOMEONE!

I GOT MY LICENSE REVOKED

FOR A WHOLE ENTIRE YEAR
BY THE COPS.

IS THAT ALL THAT MATTERS
TO YOU?

YEAH!

WHAT WE DID WAS WRONG.

WE BROKE THE LAW, BLAKE!

YOU WERE THERE, TOO!
DON'T FORGET IT! HUH?

I HAVEN'T.

WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A PANSY NOW, MAN?

WHERE'S SARA?

SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE
ABOUT HER?

SINCE SHE BECAME MY FRIEND!

OH, YOUR FRIEND. HUH?
WHAT ABOUT US?

OH, THIS?
YES, THIS IS BEING MY FRIEND.

MORE THAN YOU'VE
BEEN LATELY.

DID YOU EVEN VISIT ME
IN THE HOSPITAL?

AND BLAKE.
BLAKE CHECKS OUT AND RUNS.

WHY ARE YOU TURNING
INTO SUCH A GIRL?

WHERE IS SHE?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER?

SHE'S FINE. RELAX!

YEAH, SHE JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE TIME TO THINK.

TELL ME WHERE SHE IS NOW!

OR WHAT?!
YOU WANT TO FIGHT?!

MAYBE YOU COULD KNOCK THINGS
BACK INTO PLACE AFTER ALL.

YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ME, FINE.

DON'T DRAG HER INTO THIS.

OH, THAT'S TOO LATE.

YOU'RE GONNA PUNISH HER
BECAUSE OF ME?

LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

WHO'S THE BAD GUY NOW?

FINE.

HOW LONG, EDDIE?

HOW LONG TILL YOU MEAN NOTHING
TO THEM, TOO?

OH, OH.
OH, HOW LONG, EDDIE?

WHEN DID COLTON GROW
A HEART?

HEY, COACH.

HEY, I'M GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

THANKS FOR INVITING US.

WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WATCH HER PLAY.

WE HEARD SHE HAD A SETBACK,

BUT WE'RE ANXIOUS TO SEE
WHAT SHE CAN DO.

SHE'S COME A LONG WAY.
I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASED.

WELL, GREAT.
THANKS A LOT.

OKAY, ENJOY THE GAME.
THANK YOU.

CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW LAME
HE IS?

ALMOST AS BAD AS EDDIE
USED TO BE, RIGHT?

[ LAUGHS ]

Hey, this is Sara.
Leave me a message.

SARA, WHERE ARE YOU?

SARA!

SARA!

SARA!

SARA!

Girl: HEY!

COLTON.
SHE'S THIS WAY.

SARA!

SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

COLTON.

ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH. MY GAME.

I KNOW.
YOU SHOULD GO.

THANKS.
I'LL CATCH UP.

I THINK I JUST LOST MY PLACE
WITH BLAKE AND JOHN.

DUDE, YOU'RE BETTER OFF.

HEY, SORRY ABOUT --

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

I SHOULD GO.

HEY, EDDIE.

YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

COACH. I'M HERE.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
LONG STORY.

ARE YOU READY?

DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

NO PRESSURE.

YOU THINK SHE'S READY?

I GUESS WE'LL SEE.
I HOPE SO.

Woman: ALL RIGHT, SARA!
WHOO!

SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

NO. IT'S PROBABLY JUST
THE ADRENALINE.

â™ª FEELS LIKE I'M BURNING
AND YEARNING FOR DECADES â™ª

â™ª EVERY MOMENT IS SLIPPING
THROUGH THE SAND â™ª

GOOD JOB, SARA.

â™ª AND IT ECHOES AND BELLOWS
'CAUSE IT'S ONLY CHARADES â™ª

â™ª EVERY MOMENT IS WRITTEN
ON YOUR PLAN â™ª

â™ª WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE? â™ª

â™ª WHEN WILL IT FADE? â™ª

â™ª MY MIND IS AN EARTHQUAKE,
AND IT'S TREMBLING EVERY DAY â™ª

â™ª RUNNING THROUGH THE MAZE â™ª

â™ª OPEN THE TRAP DOOR,
I AM WAITING â™ª

â™ª TAKE ME FROM THIS PLACE â™ª

â™ª I'M LOST,
MY NERVES ARE SHAKING â™ª

â™ª I CAN'T FIND MY SPACE â™ª

â™ª I AM STUCK
AND I'M SUFFOCATING â™ª

â™ª WHY CAN'T I GET OUT OF HERE? â™ª

â™ª FEELS LIKE I'M FACING
AND CHASING THE TRUTH NOW â™ª

â™ª EVERY MOMENT IS TIGHTENING UP
MY NOOSE â™ª

â™ª IS IT CHANCE, CIRCUMSTANCE? â™ª

â™ª I JUST DON'T KNOW NOW â™ª

â™ª EVERY MOMENT IS PLANNED
WHEN I'M WITH YOU â™ª

â™ª WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE? â™ª

â™ª WHEN WILL IT FADE? â™ª

â™ª MY MIND IS AN EARTHQUAKE,
AND IT'S TREMBLING EVERY DAY â™ª

WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

YOU WERE SO FAR AHEAD
AND LOST THREE GAMES IN A ROW.

I KNOW, BUT SHE'S REALLY --
NO, IT'S NOT HER.

YOU'RE LOSING FOCUS.

YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME.

ALL YOU NEED IS ONE MORE GAME,
AND YOU WIN.

OKAY.

Colton: SARA.

I'M NOT HITTING MY SERVE.
MY AIM IS WAY OFF.
CALM DOWN.

YOU'RE PLAYING GREAT.

THE END IS IN SIGHT,
AND YOU'RE GETTING SCARED.

IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT
OUT THERE.

YOU'RE STRONG.
YOUR KNEE IS FINE.

THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO STOP
YOU FROM GETTING THROUGH THIS.

THANKS.
Coach: LET'S GO, SARA.

I GOT TO GO.

SARA.

GOOD LUCK.

THANKS.

COME ON, SARA. ONE MORE GAME
AND THE MATCH IS YOURS.

SHAKE THAT ONE OFF, SARA.

SHE'S PSYCHING HERSELF OUT.

[ SIGHS ]
SHE'S BETTER THAN THIS.

COME ON, SARA.
KEEP YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

REMEMBER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR.

PLEASE, HELP ME.

YES!

THAT'S RIGHT.

THAT'S IT.

KEEP IT UP.

COME ON. TWO MORE.
JUST TWO MORE.

YEAH!

COME ON, SARA. LAST ONE.
OKAY, STAY FOCUSED.

DON'T BE SCARED.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

[ GRUNTS ]

YES!

GOOD JOB, SARA.

GOOD GAME.
YOU TOO.

WELL, COACH.
THAT WAS A FUN GAME.

I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
I THINK SHE DID A GREAT JOB.

SHE REALLY DID.
WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED.

YOU CAN TELL HER
SHE'LL BE HEARING FROM US SOON.

WE THINK SHE'LL MAKE
A WONDERFUL ASSET

TO OUR PROGRAM THIS SUMMER.

THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

SHE'LL BE SO EXCITED
TO HEAR THAT.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING.

YOU BET.

WHOO!

YOU DID IT.

GREAT JOB!
YES!

YOU DID GREAT.

WELL, YOU DEFINITELY
GOT THEIR ATTENTION.

REALLY?

I THINK YOU CAN EXPECT AN
INVITATION THIS SUMMER, AS WELL.

CONGRATULATIONS.

THANKS.

YOU DID IT.

COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

YEAH, YOU COULD,
BUT THANKS FOR LETTING ME HELP.

I THINK A CELEBRATION'S
IN ORDER.

REALLY?

YEAH.

WELL, WHERE ARE WE
GONNA GO THEN?

ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

â™ª ON AND ON I STOP AND WONDER â™ª

â™ª WONDER IF YOU THINK OF ME â™ª

â™ª I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR HONOR â™ª

â™ª IN THIS CONSTANT STATE
OF TRAGEDY â™ª

â™ª I'M SEARCHING FOR A SIGN
FROM SOMEWHERE â™ª

â™ª OF WHO THE HELL
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE â™ª

â™ª OH, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT ME â™ª

â™ª FORWARD MOTION PULLS ME
DOWN IN â™ª

â™ª MY SHALLOW BREATH
IS LOSING GROUND â™ª

â™ª I FALL APART
OVER THE SIMPLEST THINGS â™ª

â™ª BEEN AFRAID
I'M TIRED OF THAT â™ª

â™ª A LITTLE SLOW
IN CLIMBING BACK â™ª

â™ª MY ONLY CRIME IS TAKING
WHAT I NEED â™ª

â™ª JUST HOLDING ON FOR SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE â™ª

â™ª I'M HOLDING ON
FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE â™ª

â™ª ON AND ON I STOP AND WONDER â™ª

â™ª WONDER IF YOU THINK OF ME â™ª

â™ª OH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR HONOR â™ª

â™ª IN THIS CONSTANT STATE
OF TRAGEDY â™ª

â™ª I'M SEARCHING FOR A SIGN
FROM SOMEWHERE â™ª

â™ª OF WHO THE HELL
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE â™ª

â™ª OH, I DON'T CARE â™ª

â™ª OH, I DON'T CARE â™ª

â™ª OH, I DON'T CARE â™ª

â™ª IF YOU THINK ABOUT ME â™ª
