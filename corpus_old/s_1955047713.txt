   and then one day they just
  stop, and then it's just OK.

        Well, maybe the
       world's like that.

      Maybe it's all going
    off, species by species,

       object by object,
     everything in decline.

       -When I was a kid,
        I still remember

        that a movie was
        magic, you know?

      It was really magic.

    People used to go to the
   theatre and buy a ticket,

   and this is the only place
  that you could see a movie.

 You know, you buy a ticket and
  you go to the-- to this dark

            theatre.

 We'll go and we'll dream, and
  you could kind of fly away.

            [typing]

  INTERVIEWEE: Hey, you know,
   it doesn't exist anymore.

     So this magic is gone.

       -Looks like you'll
     have a great weekend.

       A man is obsolete.

    still make life sweeter.

          Great book.

     -You actually know it?

             -Sure.

         Thomas Brown.

  The "Pseudodoxia Epidemica"
    is one of my favorites.

             -Wow.

       I mean, I was just
        checking it out

       because I'm doing
       a paper on Sebald.

    -"The Rings of Saturn."

             -Yes.

       Listen, um, I was
       wondering, uh, I'm

 having a few people around my
  house for some food and wine

 and I thought maybe you'd like
to come if you're not too busy.

              Um.

             -Um--

   -I mean, it's no big deal.

    It's just a few people.

            It's OK.

    It's-- it's last minute.

             -Um--

        -You know what?

   You don't have to explain.

           It's cool.

        Maybe, um, maybe
        some other time.

             -Yes.

           Thank you.

 -Well, uh, I'll see you, then.

        -Enjoy the book.

    this is George speaking.

              Yes.

 Sophie, thank you for calling.

      Uh, well, whenever's
         good for you.

Um, two o'clock should be fine.

    Yes, two o'clock's fine.

     OK, I'll see you then.

      Oh, and I-- I truly
         appreciate it.

              OK.

        Thank you, then.

            Goodbye.

      MAN: Jeez, remember
         when you were

   a kid, how you used to see
   a shooting star at night?

       Now you look, you
      see something, it's

a bloody satellite or something.

              -Hm.

    Well, in some ways, I'm
    kind of glad about that.

             -What?

    -Not the satellite part.

       The shooting stars
        make me nervous.

      -Come on, you gotta
       be joking, right?

           -Well, no.

    I mean, they're probably
   part of a meteorite, and--

          and, uh, the
     meteorite was probably

  part of a planet or a star.

             It's--

             -Wow.

    You're a depressive son
      of a bitch at times.

      -Not so depressive.

        It's just true.

     I mean-- you know, and
    if it's not a meteorite,

       it was probably a
      piece of space junk.

    Did you know that there
   are 12,000 charted pieces

of rockets and satellites flying
around the Earth at the moment?

-You know what your problem is?

-That I see things as they are?

              -No.

    Not what I was thinking.

    You know that girl that
  works down at the Mac Store

      down on the corner?

             Marta?

            -No, I--

         -Yeah, you do.

         And I reckon--

        -Listen, Mitch.

The thing is, love is obsolete.

       -Love is obsolete?

            -Mm-hm.

       It's even an entry
      in my encyclopedia.

 -But who's talking about love?

     -At very best, it was
     only ever an illusion,

     induced to ensure the
  procreation of the species.

  And now that that's possible
     without human contact,

    it's-- it's unnecessary.

      -Well, on that happy
     note, I'm off to bed.

       -Well, it's true.

       I mean, an Italian
      university has just

        proved that love
       is just a protein.

       --[laughs] Love is
        just a protein.

     Now I've heard it all.

         -Uh, you don't
       want another beer?

      -Good night, George.

      -Good night, Mitch.

       Just gotta focus.

             Yeah.

-So how do you want to do this?

   GEORGE: Well, I'll ask the
   questions and you answer.

      -Will it go online?

        GEORGE: No, it's
      going to be a book.

      -Where are you from?

  GEORGE: Here, last 20 years.

            -Accent?

   -My mother was Australian.

  How long have you been here?

          -Six months.

    GEORGE: That's not long.

 -Long enough to call it home.

    GEORGE: Shall we start?

 -Where'd you get that camera?

      GEORGE: Flea market.

         -And you film
      everyone like this?

      I mean, everyone you
     think is disappearing?

            -Uh-huh.

      And I then take the
   tapes home and transcribe

  what's good for their entry.

              -Oh.

        Can I come over
     sometimes, watch them?

             -Why?

         -I'm curious.

   You know, to see who else
     is dying off like me.

              -Um.

     -Do you actually make
     a living out of this?

GEORGE: No, I work in a library.

 -So have you filmed yourself?

   GEORGE: What do you mean?

       -Well, libraries.

   GEORGE: Oh, they won't be
   obsolete for a long time.

        -You're kidding.

         Everyone gets
     everything online now.

     -Well, actually, only
       41% of households

    that earn under $40,000
    a year have a computer,

     so there's still a lot
      of people out there

  that need to use libraries.

     SOPHIE: And of the 59%
   that don't have computers,

  how many ever actually read?

    -When was the last time
     you were in a library?

        These days, most
    people just borrow DVDs

  and use the computers there.

So shall we start the interview?

             -Sure.

         Do I look OK?

       It doesn't matter.

       No one'll see it.

         -Wrong answer.

      GEORGE: Well, you--
         you look fine.

   -You're not reassuring me.

    GEORGE: You look pretty.

             -I do?

           Thank you.

    GEORGE: So if you could
      start by telling us

     your name and a little
     bit about what you do.

              -OK.

       My name is Sophie
      Fitzpatrick and I'm

        a projectionist,
        which I think is

       the coolest job in
      the world, because I

get to watch thousands of films.

     [fast-forward chatter]

  Every time you play a print,
 it leaves a little purple dust

            behind.

       It's basically the
     emulsion wearing away.

    I mean, eventually that
    print won't even exist.

       And in the future,
    projectionists will just

  download files, press play,
and it will be a purpley world.

        And all of this?

         You're right.

     [cell phone vibrates]

          -Oh, sorry.

 GEORGE: Um, you can get that.

            -Uh, no.

  I don't want to talk to him.

         Anyway, yeah.

       All of this, it's
        on its way out.

           It's over.

       It'll all be gone.

      CO-WORKER: You done?

    We're ready to lock up.

   -Uh, just one more minute.

-What I don't understand is why
 don't you just buy a computer?

 Then you can do this at home.

    -Because the more of us
    that resist buying them,

 the more pressure there is to
  keep places like this open.

   -This place will be open.

You need to move with the time.

      -Or your conscience.

        Take your pick.

       -No point swimming
       against the tide.

   -Unless the tide is taking
     you out to the ocean.

      How did you find me?

          -Phone book.

    I mean, I hope you don't
  mind, but you did say that--

          -Yeah, yeah.

    It's, uh, I thought you
    were-- phone book, huh?

   Well, I thought I was one
     of the only people who

    still used phone books.

       -Well, phone book
     online, but you know.

             -Yeah.

  -Is this a bad time for you?

              -No.

      -So could I come in?

             -Sure.

             Yeah.

   -Wow, this place is cool.

  It's like a museum in here.

 -Everything old and forgotten.

       -It's-- would you
       like a cup of tea?

   SOPHIE: That'd be lovely.

        -Um, Earl Grey?

      -That's my favorite.

       -Uh, milk, sugar?

  SOPHIE: You still use this?

      GEORGE: What's that?

    SOPHIE: The typewriter.

        GEORGE: Sure, it
        works perfectly.

 -Yeah, but wouldn't it just be
easier to switch to a computer?

    GEORGE: Into a computer.

        It's political.

   So what can I do for you?

       -I'm interested in
       your "Obselidia."

        -My "Obselidia"?

   SOPHIE: Your encyclopedia.

   Yeah, I decided you should
    call it the "Obselidia."

       O-B-S-E-L-I-D-I-A.

        -Shouldn't it be
     O-B-S-O, technically?

        SOPHIE: Yeah, I
       know how to spell.

     It just kind of looks
       better with an E.

   And you should definitely
   put it online, believe me.

      So did you interview
       any fishermen yet?

        -Uh, fishermen?

   -Well, there's practically
       no fish left, so.

  What about Lonesome George?

  -Uh, who's Lonesome George?

        -You never heard
      of Lonesome George.

     Well, Lonesome George
        is quite likely

     the last giant turtle
       of the Galapagos.

     He's like 75 years old
     now and he'll probably

    last another 100 years,
       completely alone.

             -Wow.

         Is that true?

       [kettle whistling]

   -I think that's the water.

             -Yes.

     -So I'm going to this
     museum this afternoon,

       and I wondered if
      you wanted to come.

          -Which one?

         -The Museum of
      Jurassic Technology.

        Do you know it?

  GEORGE: Jurassic Technology?

       That's ridiculous.

        -Yes, it's kind
       of a weird place.

       -So is it a hoax?

    -I'm not sure, exactly.

       -I'm kind of busy
        this afternoon.

       -Reading about the
       end of the world?

   -I have to post a letter.

   -You still use snail mail.

       -I don't think Mr.
     Fordham has an email.

    -The author of the book?

 So we can post it on the way.

     Come on, it'll be fun.

        My car or yours?

        [music playing]

        [bells tinkling]

    -Wow, they're beautiful.

       -I think that's a
        Delias eucharis.

        -I always wanted
       to be able to fly.

              -Hm.

      -"Telling the Bees.

   If a member of the family
 dies, the bees in their hives

must be told, or they will die.

 The procedure is that as soon
 as the master has breathed his

     last, a member of the
 household must visit the hives

and whisper three times, 'Little
   brownies, little brownies,

     your master is dead.'"

              -Hm.

   SOPHIE: They look so real.

        I'd love to live
        in one of those.

      GEORGE: I prefer the
     feeling of permanence

     a real home gives you.

SOPHIE: But what about freedom?

NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): In his
three-volume book, "Obliscence,

  Theories of Forgetting, and
    the Problem of Matter"--

    -Can you hear anything?

          NARRATOR (ON
     RECORDING): Sonnabend

 departed from previous memory
   research with the premise

  that memory is an illusion.

      -Mine doesn't work.

      SOPHIE: Share mine.

          NARRATOR (ON
    RECORDING): Experience.

     From this perspective,
       we, amnesiacs all,

    condemned to live in an
  eternally fleeting present,

have created the most elaborate
    of human constructions--

  memory-- to buffer ourselves
   against the intolerable--

    -Do you understand this?

NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): Of the
 irreversible passage of time.

            -Mm-hm.

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    And the irretrievability

  of its movements and events.

      Sonnabend did not--

    -Do you think it's true?

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
 Deny the experience of memory

            existed.

             -What?

     -That it's forgetting
         that saves us?

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
         Was predicated

        on the idea that
      what we experience--

     -I don't think that's
       what he's saying.

          -But do you?

          Do you think
      forgetting saves us?

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    Artifical constructions

    of our own design, built
   around sterile particles--

              -No.

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    Of retained experience.

     -I think if we forget
everything, we lose who we are.

  NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): By
   infusions of imagination.

          -Don't you?

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
         As the blacks

 and whites of old photographs.

  -I think I prefer to forget.

    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
        By the addition

of color or tints in an attempt
to add life to a frozen moment.

       -I have to admit,
       that was amazing.

     Though you do realize,
    most of it was made up?

     --[gasp] Can't believe
         you said that.

        -No, it's true.

      I mean, there is no
      Geoffrey Sonnabend.

         I would know.

 -Why, do you know everything?

              -No.

  It's just-- well, let's see.

        There's a Sonnu,
     Sonya, Sonnek-- Oscar.

    He was a jazz musician.

      -What's that got to
       do with anything?

  -Well, they're just entries
      in the encyclopedia.

       And if there was a
      Geoffrey Sonnabend,

   he would come after them.

        But he doesn't.

    I think it's Sonnenfels.

     Josef von Sonnenfels.

         -Wait, you're
      telling me that you

 remember entire encyclopedias?

              -No.

        Just bits, hey?

     I like to learn them.

             -Why?

        -Well, for fun.

      I've always done it,
       since I was a kid.

It's-- It's like a memory game.

       -Did your parents
        make you do it?

              -No.

 -Didn't get on with them, huh?

     -Oh, I can't complain.

      My mother died when
       I was young, but--

        -Oh, I'm sorry.

 -Would you like that tea now?

            [laughs]

    -So have you always been
   obsessed with old things?

     -It's not old things.

  I just don't understand why
    people throw things away

   that still work perfectly
   well, just because they've

        been superseded
       by something new.

  I mean, there's this common
 illusion that new things make

      our lives easier and
    better, and they don't.

        Not necessarily.

    -So why do you use that
    shitty old video camera?

       -Because it costs
       $50 and it works.

 Now, with new things becoming
 old in a matter of months, not

     years, I just want to
    slow things down a bit.

      SOPHIE: Oh, that's a
    bit nostalgic, isn't it?

      -Well, you-- I even
      experience nostalgia

  with things in the present.

     I mean, because I know
 that-- that these things will

 become forgotten, really soon.

       Can it-- can it be
   nostalgia in the present?

    -Maybe it's now-stalgia.

         -Now-stalgia?

             -Yeah.

          Now-stalgia.

     You know, that feeling
    that everything that is

         is gonna end.

 -Well, it is all going to end.

   SOPHIE: I remember I once
     had this leather coat.

   It was the most money that
     I'd spent on anything,

   and when I got it home, I
  remember just looking at it

  and feeling so sad, because
     I knew it would never

       be better than it
      was in that moment.

    In a few years' time, it
   would be worn and shabby,

 and it kind of broke my heart.

       -The Sioux Indians
      used to say nothing

should be made perfect, because
 then you become attached to it

    and it causes you pain.

    So if you have something
       pristine and new,

 you should damage it slightly.

            -Really?

     -I don't think we ever
 really experience perfection.

       It's an illusion.

        Like your coat--
        I mean, the fact

       that it was doomed
         to become old,

     that's an imperfection
          right there.

     I think the notion of
 perfection is a Platonic trick

  to make us feel inadequate.

    -Do you feel inadequate?

             -Yes.

       Doesn't everybody?

    -At least you're honest.

      -Well, I don't think
      that does much good.

    I don't think honesty's
    the most valued quality

  in our contemporary society.

      -Doesn't pay much to
       be humble, either.

        So what's going
       to become of you?

        -Certainly on a
      global scale, we are

going to lose plenty of species
  due to environmental changes

  because of human activities.

Um, I think that we understand--
     biologists understand

a lot of what needs to be done.

       And the key is the
      sort of willingness

and the priorities of everyone,
  to try to take actions now.

  GEORGE (VOICEOVER): [LISTING
  ENTRY NAMES ALPHABETICALLY,

        STARTING WITH L]

        [phone ringing]

      GEORGE (ON ANSWERING
    MACHINE): Hello, you've

    called "The Encyclopedia
      of Obsolete Things."

     Please leave a message
       and we'll get back

   to you as soon as we can.

             [beep]

    SOPHIE (ON PHONE): "The
  Obselidia," I'm telling you.

     You can't call it "The
  Encyclopedia of Yadda Yadda

             Yadda.

    You've got to start with
    a great title, you know?

      One that people are
    gonna be curious about?

      -Uh, you don't think
      they'll be curious?

-I didn't think you were there.

         -Uh, I wasn't.

   I was releasing ladybugs.

      -Releasing ladybugs?

    GEORGE (ON PHONE): Yeah.

    They need the lifeline.

             -Nice.

        -So how are you?

    SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Good.

            And you?

 GEORGE (ON PHONE): Oh, I'm OK.

        -Did you do any
      more interviews yet?

     -No, just got a letter
      from Lewis Fordham.

 SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Brilliant.

   And is he up for meeting?

           -Um, yes.

          Yeah, he is.

        But he lives in
       Death Valley, so.

         -Death Valley?

             Cool.

       GEORGE (ON PHONE):
      It's not, actually.

 It's very, very hot, and it's
  hundreds of miles away, so.

  SOPHIE (ON PHONE): I thought
you said this guy was a genius.

       GEORGE (ON PHONE):
       Well, he-- he is.

          He is, but--

     -You won't drive four
      hours for a genius?

   -Well, it-- it's not that.

         It's-- it's--

       SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
       I've driven double

        that just to go
       to a party before.

      -You might remember
    that I don't have a car.

              -So?

        I'll drive you.

          -Oh, no, no.

       SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
         Sure, why not?

  -No, it's-- it's OK, really.

   SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Doesn't
   this mean anything to you?

  Come on, I've always wanted
     to go to Death Valley.

 "Zabriskie Point," Antonioni?

   Oh, I'd love to see that.

       So when do we go?

           -Hey, man.

        How's it going?

      You going somewhere?

         -Death Valley.

         -Death Valley?

              Wow.

           -With her.

           -Not bad.

        Not bad at all.

     -She's just a friend.

             -Yeah.

     Remember, love is just
       a protein, George.

  GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Protein,
 Protestant, Proteus, prophet,

prosthesis, Protista, protocol,
    Protogenes, protoplasm,

          [inaudible].

           Protozoa.

    -So, you got everything?

  -How long are we going for?

        -Well, I packed
      some water and food,

     and I have my gorgeous
        Polaroid camera.

             -Wow.

       That's beautiful.

             May I?

             -Yeah.

  -I knew you'd appreciate it.

     You know they stopped
        making the film?

             -Sure.

So I've got three pictures left.

       That's it-- three.

  Got to make them good ones.

   -Oh, I'd hold on to them.

    -Well, I've been holding
  on to them for long enough.

    And I've packed my tent
    in case we want to camp.

           -Uh, camp?

 I-- I'm not sleeping outside.

             -What?

 -I've never slept outside, I--

        -You're kidding.

  -Why would I kid about that?

         -I don't know.

    'Cause you want to seem
  like some strange city guy.

   -I am a strange city guy.

        [engine starts]

    I just thought we'd get
    a couple of motel rooms.

    SOPHIE: [laughs] You're
     funny, you know that?

         GEORGE: You're
      funnier if you think

  we're going to camp outside.

     Animals sleep outside.

       That's why humans
       invented Motel 6.

  SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): [laughs]

        [music playing]

   Do you know what I really
      love about America?

          GEORGE: No.

    What do you really love?

     SOPHIE: The fact that
    nothing's built to last.

    Everything looks like it
    could be gone tomorrow.

GEORGE: And that's a good thing?

         SOPHIE: Yeah.

It means everything can change.

     It's not set in stone.

GEORGE: No, just set in stucco.

      SOPHIE: Yeah, well,
        where I'm from,

      everything was built
     a long, long time ago

and it'll all be there forever.

  GEORGE: But will it really?

 SOPHIE: Makes me feel trapped.

  GEORGE: So you prefer this?

         SOPHIE: Yeah.

         I prefer this.

     GEORGE: French fries.

          SOPHIE: Yum.

    GEORGE: So do you think
       you'll stay in LA?

         -I don't know.

            -Do you?

            -Mm-hm.

   I like my home and my job.

    -Here, I made you this.

            -Thanks.

      -I mean, I like LA.

       But I really just
     moved here for a guy.

 -Are you, um, still together?

             -Well.

      We lived together in
    New York a couple years

   before we moved out here.

     -And what does he do?

             -Paul?

He wants to be a movie director.

  Totally obsessed with films.

       But you know, all
        the wrong films.

          -Which are?

         -I don't know.

   Well, he thinks like "Star
 Wars" is the best movie ever.

     -"Star Wars" is good.

   -OK, "Star Wars" is good.

 But he wouldn't watch foreign
   movies or black-and-white.

    I mean, it's like cinema
 started with "The Godfather."

 -Probably a lot of people feel
like that nowadays, don't they?

       -Yeah, absolutely.

    But I just don't know if
     I can be with somebody

      who won't watch "Au
       Hasard Balthazar."

         -That donkey.

          -Oh, I know!

            Exactly.

    Meanwhile, Paul says, I
   won't do black-and-white,

     I won't do subtitles,
       and I sure as hell

   won't do a black-and-white
subtitled movie about a donkey.

       Actually, maybe he
       does have a point.

            [laughs]

         I don't know.

We should get back on the road.

            [snorts]

            [laughs]

        You've got a bit
       of green going on.

              -Oh.

       Your turn to drive
         as well, yeah?

      -Uh, I don't drive.

             -What?

   -Yeah, I don't have a car.

   -You're kidding me, right?

     You got to, like, how
     old, and living in LA,

      and you don't drive?

         Time to learn.

    So tell me about Lewis.

   -(NERVOUSLY) Um, uh, he--
 he-- back in the day he worked

   for NASA, and he was-- he
    predicted climate change

       before-- anybody.

      And-- and if they'd
        listened to him,

       maybe it wouldn't
      be such a mess now.

       Oh, what do I do?

      There's a big, fast
        red car coming.

          -What is it?

          What is it?

    Oh, stay steady, George.

          Stay steady.

              -OK.

             -Whew!

          We made it.

     -Look, I didn't think
     I could talk and drive

       at the same time.

     And can you please not
    point that camera at me?

        -All right, all
       right, I'm sorry.

      -Oh, what do we do?

I mean, I think there's a turn.

         -OK, take it.

              -OK.

          -Turn, turn.

              -OK.

    [polaroid takes picture]

           -Oh, shit!

         GEORGE: What?

  SOPHIE: [sigh] Three bloody
    pictures left and I just

           blew one.

       GEORGE: I'm sorry.

 SOPHIE: No, it's-- it's fine.

    Imagine living out here.

    Wouldn't you get lonely?

    -Some people get lonely
   in the middle of the city.

       LEWIS: So George,
       which publication

   did you say you were from?

       -"The Encyclopedia
      of Obsolete Things."

    -Oh. [chuckles] I guess
  that covers most everything

        these days, heh.

            Sophie.

       SOPHIE: Thank you.

             -Yeah.

      -So beautiful here.

        LEWIS: You think
       this is beautiful?

             -Yeah.

    -Well, you're in dubious
 luck, because in a little more

  than 50 years' time, most of
 the world will look like this.

       -You don't really
     believe that, do you?

   -Not a question of belief.

 Here's how it is-- God, if he
 exists, his own honest truth.

    By 2020, extreme weather
   patterns will be the norm.

     Earth's cooling system
   will fail with the melting

       of the polar caps.

      And by '20, 50, 75%
       of all land mass--

    that which has not been
 claimed by rising sea levels--

   will be desert, just like
     what we see around us.

   And by 2100, 80% of human
    population-- decimated.

      -That's ridiculous.

             -Yes.

       It is ridiculous.

   But that's the way it is.

    -But-- you-- what if we
 seriously cut carbon emissions

 in the next five years, say in
 line with the Kyoto Protocol?

 -If you'd asked that, George,
 40 years ago, maybe a chance.

          But not now.

         -And surely if
       more people switch

  to sustainable green living.

  -"The Titanic" is going down
and we are rearranging the deck

            chairs.

 We have hit the damn iceberg.

  Nothing we can do about it.

         -There must be
      something we can do.

           -There is.

 Enjoy it while we can, because
    it isn't going to last.

      Do our best to treat
        it with kindness

   and enjoy it while we can.

    So let's drink to that.

            [clink]

 Such-- such gentle creatures.

           [buzzing]

     -Each working for the
    collective good of all.

       If only man could
    learn to live that way,

 hm, maybe we'd save the bees.

 You heard about their plight?

       -Yeah, of course.

      I read that as many
       as 90% of the bees

    worldwide have died off
     in the last 17 years.

      LEWIS: That's right.

       And you know what
     Albert Einstein said?

       -If the honeybees
    disappeared completely,

      humans could survive
     only four more years.

   -Yeah, we depend on these
  creatures for our survival.

  Our being depends upon them
  as theirs does on us, yeah.

              So.

       So you're writing
        an "Encyclopedia

      of Obsolete Things."

        I-- I can't help
      but think that, um,

    that all human knowledge
   will be filed there soon.

     Um, agriculture as we
      know it-- finished.

  Things that we hold as given
truths, completely meaningless.

  Even your own encyclopedia.

  -I think I know about that.

     -Then, um, why do it?

       The past is gone.

     All it's left us with
     just a hell of a mess.

   -I think that that mess is
  partly due to our eagerness

       to move so quickly
        into the future

     without really taking
   stock of where we've been.

             -Yeah?

  I think that you're attached
   to it, the good old days.

             I was.

     But it makes me wonder
  why-- why you came out here

         to talk to me.

   -Well, I wanted to see if
  you were a reliable source.

             -Yeah?

     Well, you think I'm--
      you think I'm crazy?

              -No.

   But I-- I think there's a
   chance that you're wrong.

        I mean, a lot of
      experts in the field

 still believe there's a window
   of opportunity to change.

   -Let's say that I'm wrong,
      I'm a crazy old man.

  I'm wrong, and that there's
   a bigger window of chance

       to save the human
       race than I think.

 Five years, ten years, before
  the damage is irreversible.

     That's what they say,
     most of my colleagues.

        Well, optimistic
       colleagues, right?

            -Mm-hm.

          -Well, fine.

     So it is as they say.

    Now here's the question
     that you have to ask.

      Do you think people
      are about to change?

 Do you think that even now, in
  the face of mass extinction,

       people will change
       the way they live?

              No.

              No.

           [buzzing]

         SOPHIE: Smile.

        Three, two, one.

    [polaroid takes picture]

        SOPHIE: Perfect.

         Thanks, guys.

      -So, um, are you all
  staying around for tonight?

       -Yes, actually, I
        was going to ask

    if there's a motel that
      you could recommend.

      -Or a place to camp.

       -Well, yes, if you
      have a tent, you're

   welcome to pitch it here.

  I have no problem with that.

           -It's OK.

         -That's great.

       -Yeah, best place,
       right over there.

  Less chance or rattlesnakes.

           -Perfect.

    And I was wondering if I
   could use your telephone.

      I can't seem to get
       a signal out here.

      -Oh, I need to make
       a phone call, too.

   -I don't have a telephone.

  I am gratefully cut off from
   what they-- what they dare

       call civilization.

    Nearest phone is at the
      Amargosa Opera House

        at Death Valley
      Junction, 10 miles.

      -Cool, that's great.

    Well, we can set up camp
     and take a drive over.

  -Well, if you do, you might
 want to time it for the show.

  Marta Beckett has performed
      every Saturday night

     for the past 40 years.

    It's well worth a visit.

        -That's perfect.

            -Mm-hm.

             -Yeah.

     -I don't know if this
      is such a good idea.

    I mean, maybe we should
  just get a room in a motel.

     -So all you have to do
    is put the little poles

      in the little holes.

      Do you want to give
       me some help here?

        That's it, see?

             Easy.

       That's right, like
     in those holes there.

        -I think I might
       sleep in the car.

    -[sigh] You'll be fine.

          Look at it.

         It's gorgeous.

    Oh, it's great in here.

      SOPHIE: (WHISPERING)
    Why are you videoing it?

     You should just watch.

           [applause]

  That was amazing, wasn't it?

    It was worth coming out
    here just for that show.

         GEORGE: It was
      worth meeting Lewis.

          SOPHIE: Oh.

    GEORGE: He was amazing.

     -Doesn't he annoy you?

              -No.

  -What, not even just a bit?

        I mean, all that
     "you're all gonna die

    and there's nothing you
     can do about it" shit.

     -I don't think that's
       what he's saying.

  -Yes it is, and he's wrong.

 Just 'cause he's getting old.

    -Well, just because you
   don't agree with something

     does mean it's wrong.

          -Yes it is.

       You can never say
        there's no hope.

        So are you good?

             -Yeah.

       -Lights out then?

             [sigh]

      -Good night, Sophie.

   -(WHISPERING) Good night.

     Are you sleeping yet?

              -No.

          -Me neither.

  So is this really the first
  time you've slept in a tent?

              -No.

        -Tell the story.

    -Well, I was in a friend
       of mine's backyard

       when we were kids.

     We got scared halfway
       through the night,

     and his mom let us in.

-No Mommy to let you in tonight.

              -No.

   -But I'll look after you.

      -Good night, Sophie.

          -Good night.

             [howl]

        -What was that?

            -Coyote.

    I think it was a coyote.

 -(FRANTICALLY) What do we do?

         What do we do?

   SOPHIE: Enjoy it, George.

      We-- just enjoy it.

GEORGE: Enjoy the sound of wild
 creatures coming to devour us?

        SOPHIE: [laughs]

    GEORGE: What's so funny?

          SOPHIE: You!

          Just relax.

          We're safe.

            [laughs]

  -Are you sure we'll be safe?

  -Well, given that you think
that 80% of the human population

    will be gone in the next
     100 years, no, George,

   I don't think we're safe.

         -Point taken.

        -We'll be fine.

   At least till the morning.

         -Good morning.

       -Ah, good morning.

       Hope you like your
    eggs scrambled, George.

         -Who doesn't?

       -And desert honey,
     courtesy of the bees.

          -Thank you.

 Looks like you were up early.

   -Well, you know, I haven't
 missed a sunrise in 15 years.

   If you hike to that point,
   well, even an old atheist

       like me sometimes
   whispers the name of God.

     -As beautiful as that?

        -And then some.

       -Well, I wish you
      would have asked me.

       I would have loved
      to have joined you.

   Thank you for this, Lewis.

     -Oh, it's my pleasure.

    It's a rare treat for me
   to get visitors out here.

  People, I guess, don't much
    like what I have to say.

      -Do you have family?

-Wife is deceased, 20-odd years.

  My only son lives in Japan.

     He's a Buddhist monk.

       Of all the idiotic
    things that he could've

 chosen to do with his life, he
  opted for robes and silence.

         Your paramour.

      -(QUIETLY) Sophie's
         just a friend.

              -Oh.

         -Good morning.

           -Morning.

           -Morning.

    -My, this looks amazing.

       Thank you, Lewis.

         -My pleasure.

          -Thank you.

       -So did you enjoy
      the show last night?

   -Oh, it was magic, really.

 -I have to say, Marta Beckett
  revives my hope in mankind.

     -I can understand why.

        -So what are you
        all doing today?

       -Mm, I think we're
      going to head back.

  -What about Zabriskie Point?

    -I remember when my wife
     and I first came here.

         She said this
     reminded her of hell.

  And to me it was, and is, a
  paradise, literally millions

      of years of change,
        evolution, that

     solidified in the rock
     right before our eyes.

    To me, I find something
  very reassuring about that.

      Human race might not
      survive much longer,

      but the world will.

      That's what matters.

         Drive safely.

     And come back and see
    me before it's all gone.

        -Thanks, Lewis.

  I'll send you a copy of the
  encyclopedia when it's done.

             -Yes.

          -Bye, Lewis.

            -Sophie.

        -You can drive.

          Bye, Lewis.

          LEWIS: Bye.

        [engine starts]

   SOPHIE: "Come back and see
   me before it's all gone."

 the world is, that's for sure.

         Look at this.

            So cool.

       GEORGE: Maybe it's
     worse than I thought.

I mean, what if the whole world
 really is about to disappear?

    What if Lewis is right?

    -Oh, for goodness' sake,
    stop being so miserable.

-Why does it upset you so much?

       -Doesn't upset me,
      George, it bores me.

     -Well, you don't seem
     bored, you seem angry.

        -I'm not angry.

    I just think it's a lot
    of bullshit, all right?

    I think Lewis is wrong.

   -What, to tell the truth?

-[sigh] You know, this obsession
    you have with all things

      obsolete is absurd.

     You know what I think?

     I think if one person
    loves something enough,

   it can never be obsolete.

    -Well, that's not true.

      I love typewriters,
        and that doesn't

        mean to say that
     they're not obsolete.

     -It's because you love
     them that it's alive.

  I mean, don't you get that?

        -[LISTING ENTRY
     NAMES ALPHABETICALLY,

        STARTING WITH S]

            Sophie!

       [spring squeaking]

           -[laughs]

       [spring squeaking]

     SOPHIE: You're driving
      great now, you know?

        Just like Steve
     McQueen in "Bullitt."

       Noe one would ever
    guess you just learned.

 Wait, wait, did you see that?

           -Uh, what?

          -Look, look!

     Pull over, pull over!

        I swear to god,
       it's a ghost town.

     Come on, we've got to
     go and check that out.

            Come on!

        -Please say no.

 Please say no, please say no.

  -Come on, come check it out.

        Look, come here.

         There is one.

        It's over there.

         Check it out.

     There's a ghost town.

   Come on, we've got to go.

          GEORGE: Mmm.

   Don't you think we should
  just get to Zabriskie Point?

       -What, you scared
       of ghosts, George?

              -No.

       It's just-- well,
        that car is not

     designed for off-road
        travel, and it's

at least five miles to the town.

           -Come on!

       It's gonna be fun!

     I can't believe you're
       scared of ghosts.

             Ooooo!

        GEORGE: Oh, it's
     not-- it's not ghosts.

    It's-- look at the road.

       This is insanity.

     SOPHIE: Oh, let's live
 dangerously, George, come on!

   What have we got to lose?

    GEORGE: Just our lives.

   Have you seen enough yet?

     SOPHIE: Look at that.

       Oh, this is great.

        I have to get a
     picture of that truck.

             Look.

         GEORGE: Great.

      SOPHIE: Uh-oh, here
        comes the ghost.

Guess I should go and say hello
if I want to take that picture.

      -Do you think it's a
     good idea to get out?

I mean, no one knows we're here.

    We could just disappear.

 -If it gets weird, I'll cough
   and we'll run to the car.

             Deal?

     -But what if I notice
      it's getting weird?

          -You cough.

            [coughs]

    GEORGE: [clears throat]

         SOPHIE: Hiya.

      -Hi, how's it going?

     -We were just driving
       by, saw your sign.

            -Mm-hm.

          -I'm Sophie.

     -Ah, and you look like
    one of the Manson girls.

        -Uh, I'm George.

        -I'm Rock Novak,
     caretaker of Ballarat.

    Come on in, look around.

          Come on in.

     GEORGE: This is quite
     a place you have here.

          ROCK: Yeah.

       Yeah, I been doing
      it about five years,

        trying to build
       me a little museum

      here and-- and get a
    lot of old antique stuff

     and learning all about
     the history and stuff,

  and I got a few things here.

     So this here, I found.

   That's from the 1870 era.

       That's an old hoe.

What's special about an old hoe?

    That thing was probably
    brought here, probably,

     by the early pioneers.

 That hoe has been used a lot.

   A hoe is about that long.

 That much has been wore down.

          GEORGE: Wow.

  -So that's been used a lot.

  This is probably-- this hoe
was probably made in the 1820s,

         maybe before.

  -Hey, do you mind if I take
    a picture of that truck

           out there?

         -No, go ahead.

         That's Charlie
      Manson's old truck.

   And in the back there, you
    might find some bodies.

     GEORGE: Um, could you
      tell me a little bit

about the history of this place?

          -Yeah, sure.

   Ballarat started in 1897,
  and it only lasted 20 years

     and went out in 1917--

   [clears throat pointedly]

 ROCK: Due to World War I. This
 road out in front of Ballarat

       that goes south--

            [coughs]

       ROCK: That used to
      be the old highway.

  And the highway went all the
 way through Barstow and Apple

Valley and down to Los Angeles,
  and it come through Ballarat

      and it went through
        Wild Rose Canyon

   and it took you into Death
Valley and Nevada and all that.

     -Um, I have the video
       camera in the car,

     and I was wondering if
      it's possible for me

      to do some filming.

             -Sure.

             Sure.

           Go ahead.

          -Thank you.

            -Mm-hm.

  -Can we get out of here now?

      -No, you were right.

      This place is great.

  I need to go and get him on.

  -No, no, no, you were right.

       Plus it's blowing
      up a storm out here.

            Come on.

        -There's nothing
        to be afraid of.

       -No, we're just in
     the middle of nowhere,

    hanging out with Charlie
     Manson's bastard son.

     -I think he's too old.

     -I thought we said we
    could run if I coughed.

             -Yeah.

   -Well, didn't you hear me?

            -Sorry.

             -Shit!

       -I said I'm sorry.

     -No, I think I've left
     my camera at Lewis's.

              -Oh.

       -I can't believe I
       forgot my camera.

    -It's going to be fine.

     I mean, we'll go back
       to Lewis's, we'll

get your camera-- it'll be fine.

  -No, it's not gonna be fine.

         You know, it's
      like two hours back

    to Lewis's place, which
    means we won't have time

to go to Zabriskie Point, which
was the whole reason for coming

        to Death Valley.

        It's like, it's
      like going to Paris

and not seeing the Eiffel Tower.

        -Think about it.

      I mean, if you went
      to Paris, would you

     really want to go and
     see the Eiffel Tower?

Everybody sees the Eiffel Tower.

    I'd much rather see the
    French version of Rock.

           -I guess.

       -You shouldn't be
      so hard on yourself.

    -Easier said than done.

     I'm my dad's daughter,
   and it's some inheritance.

    -So do you think you'll
      ever have children?

         -I don't know.

     Sometimes I think I'd
   like to, but other times I

     think it's hard enough
     just looking after me.

         How about you?

           -Children?

  Now unless they've invented
  a way for men to give birth.

              -Oh.

              Oh!

      Why didn't you say?

             -What?

      -Well, you know, if
     it wasn't for Carlos,

that gorgeous Cuban hairdresser
     that I met in Brooklyn

    and married, I wouldn't
       have a green card.

     Actually, you know, I
   think you'd get on really

       well with Carlos.

   Oh, he's such a nice guy.

   I met his family, all down
  in Miami, and they're crazy.

         But you know--

  -What are you talking about?

  -I mean like you and Carlos.

  -I'm sorry-- you've lost me.

     -Look, you know, half
    my best friends are gay

    and it's not a problem.

           It's cool.

  -No, I'm not-- I'm not gay.

   Um, I was just telling you
that, you know, I'm-- I'm alone.

              -Oh.

Well, I mean that might change.

       -I'm gonna have a
       look at the bees.

              -OK.

        (CALLING) Hello?

       (SHOUTING) George.

            George!

           Oh my god.

        -What happened?

             Lewis!

       SOPHIE: I-- I just
      found him like this.

           He's dead.

            George.

     What are we gonna do?

   Let's just, um-- let's get
   him on the bed, you know?

           -Yeah, OK.

           -Come on.

              -OK.

           OK, ready?

             -Yeah.

       -One, two, three.

            [laughs]

       -What's so funny?

          -I'm sorry.

      It's just your face.

       I thought you were
         gonna be next.

-And you thought that was funny?

        -OK, sorry, OK.

       OK, wait a minute.

          GEORGE: OK.

        One, two, three.

   SOPHIE: Should I-- should
    I just drive back and--

         GEORGE: Yeah.

     SOPHIE: [sigh] Are you
     going to come with me?

          GEORGE: No.

I don't want Lewis to be alone.

    Little brownies, little
 brownies, your master is dead.

    He's dead and he's gone
  and he's never coming back.

     But that doesn't mean
     you have to die, too.

    Gentle creatures, that's
      what he called you.

       Gentle creatures.

       Please don't die.

          We need you.

        And we're sorry.

 We haven't told you, have you?

   We haven't told you, but I
   hope you can hear me now.

    Little brownies, little
 brownies, your master is dead,

  and he's never coming back.

     -It's weird, isn't it?

  How someone can be here one
   minute and then just gone?

      -We should find out
      where his son lives.

       -Where did he go?

  I remember when my Mum died.

      I mean, technically
      she was still alive

     those last few hours,
     but she'd really gone.

    I remember just holding
    her hand and telling her

       that I loved her.

  Then I went to get a coffee
and I came back and she'd gone.

       -Lewis was lucky.

         SOPHIE: Yeah.

       When I go, I want
        to go like that.

            -Me too.

  -Now getting sick and going
   to hospital and suffering.

        Just-- you know?

            -Me too.

      -It's a blessing to
     go that way, isn't it?

         It's the best.

       -Probably, but at
    least when you're sick,

       you have a chance
        to make amends.

         -That's true.


       -What do you mean?

   -Well, wouldn't it just be
   better if it disappeared?

          No warning?

            -Maybe.

       That's not the way
     it's going to happen.

     The warnings are here.

           It's sick.

             [sobs]

           [weeping]

           -It's OK.

         -It's not OK.

   The world's going to end,
    we're all going to die,

   and I haven't even started
      living my life yet.

          Not really.

    -Maybe you should start.

       -I'm not married.

      I have no real home.

    And I've probably fucked
     it up with the one guy

      that I really loved.

    My life is disappearing.

    It's just going, going.

      -You're still here.

         But I just-- I
       just want to live.

        That's all I've
       ever wanted to do.

    Don't you want to live?

             -Yes.

            -Really?

       I mean, don't you
       just want to live?

          -Yes, I do.

          -What is it?

           It's dark.

-Come on and it'll be worth it.

          -Thank you.

        For everything.

          -Thank you.

            Goodbye.

         -Bye, George.

           Hey, wait!

We never took the last picture.

        GEORGE: He was a
     truly remarkable man.

       I mean, he saw the
       end coming and it

   didn't fill him with fear.

       It filled him with
        the opportunity

      to learn, to live in
    the desert with the bees

   and to drink and to laugh.

              Yes.

     I feel honored to have
     met him, and if you're

   passing through LA, please
     feel free to call me.

    And if there's anything
     else I can do to help.

 No, I've never been to Japan.

       Thank you Goodbye.

          [rings bell]

              -Hi.

            -George!

           How did--

        -The phone book.

       Well, actually, it
       was the internet,

  and it wasn't too difficult.

  I, um, I brought you these.

          -Thank you.

       They're beautiful.

    MAN: Who is it, sweetie?

        -Just a minute.

    -I shouldn't have come.

             Sorry.

     -No, don't go, George.

           Don't go!

     You can meet-- George?

      PAUL: There you go.

      -Thanks, sweetheart.

       PAUL: No problem.

   Hey, you've got to look at
   this website I just found.

          -What is it?

   It's called obselidia.com.

  O-B-S-E-L-I-D-I-A. It should
   be O-B-S-O, but whatever.

  Check out the entry on love.

    It's got to be the most
 romantic thing I've ever read.

    "Some people say love is
 obsolete, but they are wrong.

 Love is what makes everything
   in the universe possible.

   Love is not dependent upon
     liking the same movies

       or on the species'
     need for procreation.

      Love is dependent on
      life and life alone.

   Someone once told me that
  as long as one person loves

something, it can live forever.

      You are that person.

      You have that love.

         And I give it
      today to everything

that you want to live tomorrow."

     -It's beautiful, huh?

      GEORGE (VOICEOVER):
        Maybe it's true.

     Maybe the whole world
        is disappearing.

 Species by species, object by
object-- everything in decline.

         And who knows?

       I mean, maybe you
     will wake up tomorrow

      and find everything
       you love is gone.

  But it hasn't all gone yet.

       So in a way, maybe
        Lewis is right.

 Maybe we've got to accept that
  the whole world is dying off

      and-- and just enjoy
        it while we can.

     Treat it with kindness
   and enjoy it while we can.

But I also think this-- we have
  to wake up now to the things

     that we want to save.

 And there's no time to waste.

      We have to know what
        is worth saving,

       then we have to do
    everything in our power

  to keep those things alive.

     That's our only hope.

       And true, it still
      might not be enough,

 and everything might be lost.

     But at least we tried.

       At least we tried.

      And maybe that's it.

        Maybe that's all
      we can do-- wake up

    to each fleeting moment,
   so we know we were there.

Even if "there" is gone forever.

          -Excuse me.
