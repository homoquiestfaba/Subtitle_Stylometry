Ineffable loss, my friend.

A tremendous abduction
from your world.

She's so beautiful.

I can't do it, I...

can't, I can't do it.

I understand
your pain, Joseph.

With that said, I wonder...

is there a little more
to speak of?

She must have been
extraordinary.

I-I don't have e-enough...

air in my lungs...

to describe her goodness.

Incredible.

Joseph...

as you depicted,
you seemed quite angry

when it all happened.

Might I ask...

did you in fact stop taking

your medicine
before her death?

No.

Yeah.

I did. I don't, I...

I don't remember,
I don't rightly remember.

I'm not takin' my medicine
now though. I know that.

Yes. That would explain me.

I can help you remember
everything if you'd like.

Not just Annabel.

I don't know if I hurt her...

or not.

I can answer
all your questions, Joseph.

One cold plunge,
a small vow of courage.

Are you certain
you won't join me?

<b>THE GHOST AND THE WHALE</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

Hi, there.

What the hell was that?

There's a murder.

Excuse me?

A murder of crows.

Good luck, darling.

It okay, Melanie. He's with me.
Thanks, Ms. Brenner.

Gosh! That was some sign.
Are you okay, man?

What a welcome! Christ sake.

I'm sorry, Mr. Hale...

I'm sorry, Mr. Hale, that was
probably the wildest thing

I've ever seen.

He thought your head
was a freakin' nest.

Come on.
I'll show you the place.

What, what's that smell?
Are you drinking?

Just a little curry.
It helps me concentrate.

Well, it's a bit narrow
for two, should you lead?

No, I'm good if you're okay.

-Okay.
-Hey!

It's very exciting that
you're here to cover the birds.

People of Bodega, they take
great pride in this production.

It's not everyday the penman
strolls into town?

Well...

-How did you hear about that?
-Come on.

A guy writes a similar article

on human trafficking at 19

wins the Chancellor Award for it

goes on to win a dozen more.

Junior Olympic sharpshooter?

It's a big deal
to people, Mr. Hale.

Well, I'm honored,
Mitch, that you recognize that.

-What do you do?
-Crab fishing in the winter.

If I get antsy, I'll hop
a sailing a boat in June.

Home sweet home.

Straight through there,
that's you.

I'm grateful. This is...

Love...

Mitch, what are these?

Yeah, that's a harpoon.
That's a flensing knife.

And this guy here,
that's a-that's a

hand lance there for whaling.

-Yeah, they're a pass down.
-Intense.

"'Tis the thing behind
the mask I chiefly hate.

"The malignant thing
that has plagued mankind

"since time began.

"The thing that has mauled
and mutilated our race

"not killing us outright,
but lettin' us live on

with half a heart
and half a lung."

Right. Right.

"'Tis the thing behind the mask

I chiefly hate, the malignant..."

-"Moby Dick."
-Thank you. There you go!

You got it.
Welcome to chateau Captree.

Let me just get settled.
I'll, I'll be right down.

Hey, take your time, buddy.

"Drinking Around The Cove
by Mitch Captree."

-Hey, Hey. Hey.
-Hey.

Well, here is the reason I came.

It's so good to see you.

-It's good to see you.
-What have you been up to?

I'm showing this guy
around town. This is...

-Ed, this is...
-Hi.

-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

-Where you guys at?
-Okay, we are in the back.

So will you boys
grab some drinks...

-You got it.
-We all drink.

-Yes, we do.
-Alright.

Alright, I'll see you in a few.

-Tom!
-Hey!

What's goin' on?
Glad to see you, man.

This is Ed Hale,
this is the new tenant

I was tellin' you about.

He's ready to rent
for a few weeks.

-Great.
-Hey, Tom.

-Hey, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

And this is my pain in the ass,
my cross to bear.

My lovely wife, Devon.

Hi. I see you've already
met my fourth choice.

Fourth choice. I thought
I was one of the three.

She had another one there.
She's always angry.

-What are you drinking, sir?
-I'll have a Dewars.

-Okay. Ice?
-Neat.

And, beer pack.
Anything you do on tap is fine.

I'll do the same, Devon.

I love this place
on a Friday night.

Mitch.
Thank you...

The ideas to write for those
who'd write themselves.

Otherwise decreed by God.

Excuse me?

Hey, hey, hey.

Sir?

Jesus...

Are you okay?

What am I missing?

You just have to trust in

the good Lord
on this one, son, and see

you won't be rid
of old Poe for the night

once he sits down
and starts his... rambling.

Better a sober cannibal than
a drunken Christian, bud?

So, pray tell and what
brings you to Bodega Bay?

I'm,
writing a piece on the birds.

The, film that was shot
up here in the 1960's.

It's, approaching
its semicentennial anniversary

and, the paper
I work for is,

looking for an interesting spin.

The "San Francisco Noise."

I thought that was
an investigator magazine

that's a... current
affairs publications?

It is. It is. It is.

We also have a large
arts and media section

and, it has been a...

I believe it has been
a real push lately

for the old classics.

Well, where will you start?

I was thinking of
starting with the locals.

And, visiting the landmarks.

You know,
uncovering all the facts

all the fun facts
and stuffs like that.

You just tell me
if you need anything

my church
is right around the corner

and the light
is always on, okay?

Alright. Now,
I've gotta make my rounds

ahem, before I return.

Nice meeting you, Ed.

You too, father. Take care.

Goodnight.

Hey, you know, what, another
round does sound good, Anne, Ed?

-Yes. Absolutely. Definitely.
-Yeah. Thank you.

Thanks, Mitch.

So the interviews you make...

I-I mean, conduct.

Um... would I...

I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm saying.

A-are you interested in helping?

I-I mean, I can do that.

Um, yeah, I mean,
I'm always here

and... I know everybody
and practically everything

and I've probably
seen that movie

a hundred times
when I was a kid.

What I'm really looking
for, Anne, is some information.

What kind of information?

Well, can I trust you?

-Hello. Hey.
-Ruddy!

-It's a fuck...
-Do you hear me?

-Fucking idiot!
-I didn't hear.

Give me my fucking money
for cigarettes. Give me it.

-Just hold the fuck on!
-Give it! Give it...

Getting the fucking pay
for you, bitch.

Give me a, give me your fiddle.

Give me your fiddle.

Whoo! Mop it up. Mop it up.

You better fucking find
a ride home. Piece of...

Hey, Dane.

Y'all settled in there?

Hi, Anne.

Good to see you.

You look nice tonight.

Don't she look
nice tonight, Dane?

Feel like singing a song
about her.

Dane, I'm at the bar, come on!

God, that's fucking great.
Look at the shit.

Look at this.

The dead deer... walks at night.

The dead deer
comes for you, Anne.

We were fucking driving down
and Ruddi just

boom, runs into this deer
that just walked out there

and then we had to pick it's
fucking horns out of the grill.

-Shit was crazy.
-That is terrible, Dane.

Why did you bring it in here?

Because it's cute.

-Cute?
-Like you.

No.

-Like you.
-Stop.

-Like you.
-Stop it.

-Like you.
-Stop it.

Take your demons with ya!

You're gonna pay for this,
Tom, you old fucker!

I'll rip you a new one,
you little bitch.

Don't you think that we forgot

how you piped up
for that fucking killer.

Yeah, that's right.
Big fucking Tom!

Nobody's keeping your
fucking secrets!

Yeah, that's right. I know
all your fucking secrets, Tom.

You know the fucking truth,
all you fuckers!

My brother, see now he's
gettin' out soon, right?

Little Jack.

That's funny. It's just a big
joke to you, ain't it?

Yeah. See how you're laughing
when my brother gets out.

Yeah. And this bar, you're done.

All you fuckers!

You are fucked.

He's gonna fuck everything up.

Yeah, little rabbit
son of a bitch.

Tell your rabbit,
tell your rabbit

little brother to bring it on.

Get the fuck off of me.

Now get out of my bar, boy.

Get out!

-You're bigger than him.
-You go.

Tom, you can't just go around
fucking assaulting good people.

Dane! Get the fuck
out of my bar now.

Get out, you fucker.

Fuck out of here.

Move along!

Next one's on the house, folks.

-Happens.
-It happens.

That didn't scare you off?

No, it takes more than that.

Mr. Hawthorne, Ed Hale.

"San Francisco Noise."

Mr. Hawthorne...

Is there no merciful reprieve

for good men
on Earth's dry surface?

I'm getting visits.

A reporter came here, said that

he wanted to do a story on me.

On my side of what happened.

He says everybody in the town
has talked about it

and I have a right
to do the same.

What do you think?

That's curious.

I wonder, Joseph,
did you perhaps call him here?

What?

Why would you say that?

He said the same thing.

I didn't mean to imply
that you had

I was simply asking because,
well, it seems rather peculiar

that this gentleman
would venture all the way out

here for no apparent reason.

What would be his motivation?

What if I called him?
What if I called him?

What if I...

What if I contacted...
I don't even remember.

The best thing to do now
is to join me in the water

this way we know the truth
and what we're up against.

I don't have time for that
right now.

Maybe he knows something
about Annabel.

What happened that day...

Why she can't rest.

You haven't been back
for quite sometime.

Are you certain
you're up for it?

If you could swim

I'd swim with you, Joseph.

If I could walk,
I'd walk with you.

Anybody missin' a dog?

Hey... there you go.

Hey.

Hi.

Hi.

I'm sweating, I know.

-It's hot out there, I'm sure.
-Yeah.

I see you find my girl.

Her name is Glory.

She's fine. She's cool.

I-is, um...

I-is Dr-Dr. George...

Is he in town? Is he here?

George Reinhart?

He moved last year.
I'm his replacement.

He-he moved?

That's what they tell me.
I've never met him.

May I sit down for a second?

Yeah.

I'm Sweetie.

I'm Joseph.

What medications
are you on, Joseph?

Lithium and others.

You know what? Um, I don't...

I just, I just wanted to ask him
some questions and I don't

I don't really need anything.
I was hot.

I was in the area.

Just wanted a place
to cool down.

I understand.

Well, I'm a doctor, too.

I can answer any question
you might have.

You know, in fact I'd like to.

It's really boring here today.

Why don't we just start off
really nice and easy?

Tell me your full name,
I can look you up in the system.

We can go from there.

Can you-can you give me
some water... before we start?

Of course.

I'll be right back.

Mitch! I think you're missing
the point here.

It's still an alcoholic beverage
and you're still driving.

No, this is a hot toddy.

-Mitch!
-It's medicine.

It's basically a liquid form
of lozenge, you know?

-It's lemon and honey...
-And Scotch.

Yes, there's some Scotch
in there

but it helps my throat.

Yeah, they also say, it helps
while driving a mortar vehicle.

My God. Okay, okay.

Agree to disagree.
Just... You know what?

Here, let me take a look
at that list, penman.

I gotta... get back to the barn.

I got work to do.
Okey-dokey. O-okay.

So Bodega Bay pier.

Lawman's bluff.
The court house?

I'm sorry, maybe I'm not
the-the world's best tour guide

but I didn't have any of these
places mapped out for us.

I'm not here to do
the bird story.

I could care less about that.

I'm here to do a piece
on Joseph Hawthorne.

Did you change your mind?

I lied to you so you'd let me
stay at your place.

I'm sorry.

Mitch.

Mitch.

Hey, Ed, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

You need to leave me be
for a spell.

No, I understand that.
Just hear me out first.

No! Look that was not cool, man.
You betrayed my trust.

I'm letting you stay
in my freaking house.

You should have been
straight with me.

You're right, there's nothing
I can say to you that's gonna

excuse my dishonesty, but I
didn't have much of a choice.

-What the hell was that mean?
-Full disclosure.

My office received a phone call
from Joseph Hawthorne.

He said he wanted to clear
his name in the town

and he wanted us to do his story

about him and this case.

His exclusive recounting
of what happened

the day his wife went missing.

Listen, you-you... you need to
go straight to him with this.

I can't help you with any of it.

I already tried that.

He doesn't remember
calling me here.

How the hell would he?

He's a sick man and a recluse.

-Do you want his story?
-Yeah.

Take him out of here like you
did with the Boiler Brothers

in Indian country.

Wait. H-how did you...

Look,
that was different, um...

Those boys were in real danger.

Why did you get me
involved in this?

Your place is far enough away
but close enough

to get what I need.

Hawthorne gave my assistant
a list of caveats.

And if any of these
weren't met he'd pull out

and I'd lose the whole story.

We could only send
one reporter and it had to me.

No one can know why
I'm in town

and I have to come up
with another cover story.

Hence, the birds.

As far as run-of-the-mill
reporting goes, this hasn't

exactly been a cakewalk, Mitch.

Ed...

when she disappeared...

people lost it.

I mean, this whole town divided.

I mean, half of 'em
don't believe him

and the other half they...

they don't wanna speak
because they're...

they're too afraid.

What do they have
to be afraid off?

I don't know, Dane Baker
and Annabel's brothers

Ruddi and Jack Lee.

From the bar the other night?
The loud mouth?

Yeah. Yeah, and that's Ruddi.

Okay, if that family finds out
that you're poking around...

they'll come after you.

If you posture and pour any of
your intellectual cheeky logic

with them, they're-they're
gonna hurt you.

Alright. So help me
navigate around here.

No.

We'll be as delicate as possible

and together,
we'll be credited

with hooking one of
the most intriguing

stories in the last five years.

-No.
-Mitch.

Mitch, there's a witness.

Someone saw what happened

but their identity,
it's been protected.

This is public information.

This is exciting stuff. Come on.

I need fucking ally. Help me.

Annabel!

Annabel Lee! Don't leave!

Annabel!

Annabel!

Annabel!

That's what I'm talking about.

That's what I'm sitting here
educating you of.

-What's that, Joseph?
-I feel good!

I feel good! Whoo!

I'm powerful, I'm smart
and it's all coming together.

These people...

this town...

my perdition,
it's all making sense now.

I wish I could give you, I wish
I could give you this feeling.

It's explosive.
It's absolute victory.

It's Bible, it's sacrament,
it's everything!

It's deserved and I'm owed this.

Whoo!

I want to touch you.

I want to touch you.

So you could...

so you could feel it.

I wanna transfer

this fucking lightning storm
so you could feel

what I feel, what I can!
You know why?

Because you would burn!

Baby, you would burn!

You would burn so hot

and for so long...

that I have to bring you back.

That's what happened to her.

The sea...

took her... from me.

So he could bathe in her
luminance and crown her...

my queen.

Come here.

Come here.

Grab my hand. Grab my hand.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

You feel her brea...
Her veins breathing?

You feel that?

God! It feels so good!

And only I can feel it...

because I got fire

in my heart.

God! It feels so good!

To own it!

Take it in.

Breathe, breathe in.

Take it all in!

Joseph...

how long would you say
we've been here for?

What is this? A test?

I'm just wondering if you knew.

Twenty, thirty minutes.

We sat down at five.
It's now 9:30 at night.

You've only calmed down enough
in the last five minutes

for me to be able
to talk to you.

I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I have enough knowledge

to know that you need help.

I think you're trapped
in a severe psychotic state

cycling between melancholia
and mania... and hallucinating.

Why would you s...
Why would you say that?

Because you're doing it
right now.

There's no one there, Joseph!

Jesus Christ.

I'm losing my mind.

You're just lost in your mind.

We have to get you back.

All you need are a couple
of good directions back.

Maybe a... high-powered GPS

with a crazy man
tracking device.

I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

Don't be.

I'm glad you came to town
and I met you.

I don't have many friends here.

You thought you'd start
with the nutty guys first.

I guess my daddy complex works
to your advantage in this case.

These are the same pills
that you were on.

It says you are being treated
for bipolar 1?

Yeah.

And its refill
was over a year ago.

Look, this morning
you were apathetic

and tonight you were
hysterically manic.

You won't be able
to control it without these.

Can I see you again?

Take your medicine
and we'll see.

Do you love her?

Don't start.

She's nice,
she wants to help me.

Don't you got
any other friends down there?

Yes. Yes, I do, indeed.

But you're my best friend,
Joseph.

Is that okay?

I want my life again.

I'm suffering her.

I imagine
you'll return to church.

Maybe. Maybe not.
Maybe a lot of things.

Maybe...

Maybe this is good for me.

Sweetie gave me some pills,
I gonna take 'em.

I'm gonna take the pills!

Did I tell you...
I dreamt that I was a bird?

Odd really, when you think about
it because I've never imagined

myself to be another creature...

and yet still,
I could fly very high and wide.

Soar and dive.

It was truly remarkable.

I recall I was following you
through town

on the way to the ocean.

I was gliding above
making sure you were safe

making sure you were happy.

Then all of a sudden

you disappeared
beneath the older trees

and bushes where I could
no longer see you

no longer call to you
or protect you.

I felt helpless...
and started to panic.

So I dropped down
into the heavy foliage.

When I finally broke through...

I was the one walking

and the ocean
was in front of me.

I looked to the sky

and the bird
was now flying above me.

If I have
to swim away from you

I will, Joseph

because I know
we will always be friends.

But please,
tell me more about the girl

on the boat before I go.

Ruddi, get out here! Hey, Jack.

Jack.

You're home.

Hey.

Where is she?

I'm gonna take your...
I'll take you to her.

Hey, come on,
get the, get the keys.

Get the keys. Come on.

I'm just gonna get dressed.
You wanna come in and wait?

Get the keys!

-Just come in.
-No.

-Nothing's gonna happen.
-I'm not coming in, please.

You need to respect my
boundaries while we're in town.

Nothing is going
to happen, Mitch.

Alright. Fine.

-Can I get you anything?
-No.

I'll just go up the street
and get something.

I don't know, Joseph

but... Annabel was my friend.

Okay. Let's start there.

Tell me about her.

Tell me something.

It's kind of hard
to describe her.

'Cause she's not like anyone
you've ever met before.

You know how you meet people in
life and they always remind you

of somebody that you knew or
you met and you're always like

"You remind me of Scott.
Or you're so much like Terra."

She was the only Annabel Lee
I have ever met.

She smiled a lot.

She sang.

She was a painter.

And she could talk to anybody.

I mean, anybody.
Didn't matter who you were.

And she was so stunningly
beautiful and had no idea.

She was just like this...

nice, beautiful person.

To know her was special.

I miss her.

Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I think I messed up.

It's fine. It's fine.

Anne...

who's the witness to all this?

Excuse me for a second.

Anne? Anne? Anne.

You've been in town
for over a week.

What are you up to, city boy?

Those are private.

Dusty, those are private.
Give them back.

Dusty.

You're here doing a story
on my family?

There are many people
outside of Bodega

in the greater community
that wish to know

the details of this story.

There's a lot more to this
than you know.

And talking to some naive
school teacher who doesn't know

the half of it,
that's dirty in my eyes.

Probably in my husbands, too.

Not to mention
how Jack would feel about it.

That's a whole other thing.

Well, that sounds threatening.

No.

I'm not gonna say anything.

You think I wanna pay
to get Ruddi out of jail

for what he'd do to you?

I just can't promise
that Deedee is gonna

keep her mouth shut.

Okay, Dusty, I'll play along.

Who's Deedee?

She's my other personality.

She comes out when I drink

and she can be
quite a troublemaker.

And she might think your actions
here are a little disrespectful

to her family.

Don't get so worried.

I'm not drinking until tonight.

You still have
a couple of hours.

Am I making sense, Mr. Hale?

Yes. Got it.

Dusty, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting later.

We are. I just popped in to help
this man get his facts straight.

Ready?

-Happy birthday, Dusty Lee.
-Thanks.

Have a safe trip back.

Trying to fuck over
the whole family?

Hey, Sweetie.

Hi.

Do you like my flowers?

Thank you.

Forgot the blanket.

She's just up here a ways.

Had 'em,

put her off to the side
just so...

You know, away from the other
stones, like you said.

She, she looked good
in mom's dress, you know.

-She looked...
-Ruddi.

She...

Go home.

Hey, how-how are you gonna...

how are you gonna
get back then?

These are lovely. Thank you.

The white's supposed to mean
reverence and humility

which I thought was fitting.

Thank you
for listening to me

and... you know, helping me
with my medicine.

How do you feel?

Was pretty clouded the first
three or four days, then it just

you know, got a little
less desperate.

Go on.

My head's cleared now, you know.

I'm not all over the place
with the thoughts.

What was the second pill
that you, you gave me for...

It was a...

It's an anti-psychotic medicine.

Used to treat the manic episode
you were having

but now that it's settled down

all you need
is some mood stabilizer.

How do you know
all this shit?

...one, I'm a doctor

and two, I care to know.

Who is Annabel?

Annabel...

was my wife.

She... died...

in an accident in the water.

I'm so sorry.

What happened?

It was a storm...

and her boat tipped over.

She... By the time
they found her, she'd drowned.

There was nothing more
they could have done.

That's why you
went off your medicine

didn't leave the house.

'Cause you were depressed
because you loved her.

Yeah.

Sorry.

What's that?

That?

That's a combination of my ex

birth control pills and two
really good bottles of wine.

From my perspective, all three
of those sound pretty good.

Yeah, at the time
they sounded good to me too.

He was abusive?

No. No.

I was.

I was a nightmare.

I was a completely
different person.

He, he was a really good guy
that was just trying to help me

until it all just...

basically imploded.

So that's when you moved here?

So you can be good
for a change?

Take a break from,
torturing men

drinking like a pirate.

So, family?

Brothers, sisters, mom, dad?

-Only child.
-Really?

You're so good
with women, Joe.

I would have thought
you had sisters.

Nah, no sisters.

My mother left when I was six

and my father brought me up
after that.

That must have been hard.

-Sorry.
-Yeah.

Well, do you remember her?

Some stuff.

She was... nice

very affectionate,
very protective

that kind of thing.

And your dad?

He was a...

He was a diary farmer
at a pasture in this town.

Is he still alive?

I don't know.

That's the reason
my mother left.

Would you like me to tell you...

why my mother left?

No. It's fine.

Screw you.

...Anyway, this is me.

Um, this your house?

I used to go
to Sunday school here.

-Really?
-No, really.

You do... You-you live here?

Yeah, I'm renting the top floor.

Do you wanna come in
and see it?

Stop.

Tell me that you love me...

I can't...

I can't play right now.
I gotta rest some.

It's not play, Joe.

Forget it.

Really?

Never mind.

-No, listen.
-Stop.

Annabel...

I've never loved anyone more.

I can't imagine livin' a life
without you in it.

You know that.

What if I die before you?

See, that's why I don't like
talking about this.

Would you love again?

Would you trick your heart
so easily?

You are my heart...

and my love.

You ate all my cherry waffles.

It's all the medicine that you
gave me. It's not my fault.

Last night was fun, Joe.

Yeah, it was.

So...

what's next?

You tell me.

We were just here.
We got kicked out.

-I can't fucking deal with her.
-Go in.

You go see if they're in here.
Why do I always have to...

Just do what I fuckin' say!

-What's this about?
-Don't fucking touch me.

Do not fucking touch me.
I'm not kidding.

I don't know,
but it can't be good.

Now, you two, listen to me.

No one here wants
any trouble with you

so just turn around and go
right back where you came from.

It has nothing to do with you...

I will break you in half
if you will ever

speak that way...

You stay the fuck out of it!

-Get off of me.
-This is about our family!

No. Not in my bar.

I'm going to get my husband
and the sheriff...

-Go get anyone you want, woman!
-Yeah, you go get 'em, bitch!

-Them.
-Get the fuck out.

Get the fuck out! Go!

Go! Get the fuck out!

Hey! I'm Jack.

Shake it.

I said, shake it!

Good.

This man tell you who I am?

Better yet, better yet.
Did this man tell you who he is?

Me? I'm his wife's brother.

His family.

A troubled convict.

Him? He's a coward.

He's a liar. And he's a thief.

-Jack...
-Don't say a word!

What are you talking about?

Your new boyfriend is a bad guy.

He's a killer, doc.

Yeah.

You didn't tell her, Joe?

This man...

if you can call him that much

took our baby sister
out on a boat ride.

And when they came back,
guess what?

She wasn't with him.

What was it, Rude? A...

There was an angler
off a darn beach

had to fish her out.

Yeah.

He took from us.

From my family.

A daughter and a sister.

You were on that boat, Joseph?

-Is that the truth?
-Of course it is.

-I just said it.
-I wasn't on the boat with her.

No. You fuckin' lie about it...

and I'll cut you in half...

right now.

Joseph, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. What was it again?

Was it a, was it a,
a blue whale?

No, no, a humpback?

In the spring, right?

-The humpback whale.
-The humpback whale.

It was a g... The gray whale.

Yeah, the gray whale.

What the fuck is wrong
with you?

No citation, migratin'
in spring, you fuckin' fool.

They're lying,
I didn't, I-I didn't

do anything wrong, come on.

No, w-wait, ask him.

Ask him how he makes a living?

You ask him.

Ask him about our sister's
life insurance policy.

Tell her,
you fuckin' bottom-feeder.

Can I borrow something to draw?

Just me.

What him? Ruddi, Dane.

You touch him,
and I'll kill you both.

-No, Ruddi.
-Fuck.

-Alright, that's enough.
-That'll do, Jack.

You're gonna arrest me, Bill?

Like I have a dozen times
before, son.

Dane, get the hell out of here
before I kick your dumb ass.

Miss, you go home too.

I'm gonna bleed you out. Yeah?

I'm gonna bleed you out.

Look at that.

Big Tom Mulkheney?

I'm, I'm not little Lee anymore.

And you're not as scary
as you used to be, old man.

We, gonna have to work
some things out.

-That's enough, Jack.
-This suits me just fine.

That's enough, guys. Alright,
Jack get out of here, come on.

Hi.

Really, Dusty?
Was that necessary?

I told you this asshole's
doing a story on our family.

Trying to make Hawthorne
look innocent.

Dammit, Mitch.
Would you grab the index cards?

You know,
I'd really like to speak

with you guys
if you have a moment.

Jesus.

-Fuck!
-Let me explain. Can you stop?

Listen. I was afraid
that you would judge me.

Judge you?

Judge you for what?

You didn't do
anything wrong, right?

That's why I didn't tell you

because of the way
you're acting right now.

Why didn't you defend yourself

in there, Joseph?

Why? Why didn't you say anything
back to those men?

You don't understand.

Well, you're innocent, right?

Why didn't you tell them that?

Why did you let that guy
talk all that crazy shit

if it wasn't true?

Why? Why did you lie to me?

So you could fuck me?

I was just easy for you?

No!

I was the only one in town
who didn't know.

And I'm walking around
with you, with you

with God knows who!

Just let me explain, okay.

Did you do it?

Did you, Joseph?

Did you kill your wife?

Answer me!

Well, that's just as reassuring

as the last 24 hours
have been, thank you.

What are those pills
doing in your bathroom?

Is your, what-what
is your life off limits?

I mean, since we're being honest
with each other here.

I was fired from my last job
in Ashlyn, where I told my boss

that I thought
that I was God's mother

and the pills I was distributing
were messages for my children.

I'm bipolar too, Joseph.

That's why I thought
I could help you.

Because I know when a man
is in despair

and how-how fast
and hard it can spiral

until you feel like
you're lookin' out of a cave.

Now, that's the truth.

You tell me the truth.
You tell me.

What really happened,
to your beautiful Annabel Lee?

I don't know.

Unbelievable!

I'm sorry about that, Jack,
the guy, he just

he slipped between
the cracks, you know.

People at the rental office,
they said

that he was here
doin' a different story.

I mean, figured him

to be an honest guy, you know.

Can't trust anybody these days.

Right?

You saw me, though, right.
I told him that he-he can't.

He's gotta go, I mean,
he can't stay with me, he knows.

No, sir. Not if, not if
he's gonna do that story.

You know, as soon as I found out it's you
and me, it was it was over, you know, no

no hesitation... whatsoever.

You know, I could really use the
money too. I was charged top dollar

for that room upstairs,
you know, you...

Jack! Hey, Jack! Wait...

Hey, I can, I can come by later,
you know. We can...

I can crack a beer, you know.

Let's straighten
this whole thing out

you know?

If that's, if that's better.

She would have walked.

And I never would've seen
her again, you know that.

More than anyone,
you know that.

What was I supposed to say?

Hi, I'm Joseph.

I think my wife died,
but I don't exactly remember.

Can you fill my order,
and sleep with me?

It's not funny? No?

You got nothin' to say?
No clear analogies?

No profound dream for me?

Talk to me.

I tried to have a life.

You want your chop,
because I put my health in...

in front of you?

Because I needed better?

Are you so jealous...

that you would ignore...
a friend...

when he's like this?

I don't need you.

I protected you.

You're the killer.

You sprang up from the ocean
and took her from me.

You tipped the fuckin' boat.

Why am I being punished?

Whale!

I didn't mean it.

I didn't mean it.
Please, don't leave.

Whale! Don't leave me.

Come back!

I'm here.

There's no givin' that one.

Caught me
at the grocery yesterday.

Asked me about a 1,000
questions. Relentless.

Yeah, well, if he's not careful

he's gonna get a lot more
than a story.

Nice enough fella though.

It's Tom, right?

That's my name.

I'm Sweetie.
I work at the pharmacy.

That's where I met Joseph.

Okay.

I just, I wanted to say hello...

You wanna know if he did it.

If I didn't care about him,
I wouldn't...

but I do.

I'm worried about him
up in that house.

Look, I don't know
what happened that day

you know, to his wife.
I wasn't there.

Somebody was, I mean...

I mean, like I said,
it's, it's just...

it's just a big mess now.

Is he dangerous, Tom?

Look, every man's dangerous.
Every man.

I don't think
Joseph's any exception.

Do you think he did it?

I think he's sick.

I don't know that he's bad.

What about that bald guy?

The one with the scars
and the tattoos.

Why is he bothering Joseph...

Yeah, well, he's bad.

Yeah, he just did a stretch
for manslaughter.

He's been away
for the last ten years.

You know, all these
are family problems, miss.

These are local issues.

You shouldn't get yourself

involved in this.

So nobody should get involved?

Just wait around
while they kill him?

Look, I can't.

I can't get mixed up
with this bunch.

You know, I've already
put myself out there.

-But you said...
-But I said, that I like him.

I would do anything
I can for him.

And I would, but...

Look, everybody
has a past in this town.

You know, I have a wife now.

I have a business,
I have responsibilities.

You understand that?

-I understand.
-Okay.

You take care of yourself then.

You too.

-Hey, man.
-What the...

Little bit more.

Just give me,
give me that damn thing.

Jesus, where the hell...

Where the hell have you
been staying, anyway?

I've a home over
at the Ruby's Slipper.

It's fine. What?

It's nothing,
I'm-I'm just, I'm...

I'm certain that's probably
the worst motel in town.

Check it, you got bed bugs,
you got mold, you got filth.

The guys won't even
take hookers there.

Talk about story?

I was always wondering
why it was so expensive

for such a shit hole.

Hey, I'm... I'm sorry,
I kicked you out, buddy.

I just...
Believe me, I had good reason.

I understand.

I wanted the story.

And I wasn't very considerate
of your life here in town.

It's my fault, I... I just...

She's my cousin, Ed.

Why, why would you not
share that with me, Mitch?

I... You still don't get it,
do you?

No, I don't, I don't get it.

Hey, right or wrong

I can't be seen helpin' you,
because in their eyes

it makes me a fuckin' traitor.

Just so happens,
I have a family that

believes in capital punishment.

That's why I got this guy.

And... I'm just not quite
ready to give up the ghost.

This town is so ass backwards.

These people are your cousins.

Are they not?

Your baby sister went out
to sea with her husband

and never came back.

Four hours later,
Joseph steers their family boat

into a rock at Lawman's Bluff.

I know the story

He comes back bruised and bloody

with a story about this colossal

pod of migrants that

crossed their path
and tipped their boat

knocked him out
and Annabel over the side.

They don't see past
shit like that.

They don't understand
freak accidents, fate, destiny.

These are not understood
or accepted concepts here, Ed.

Specially not with the Lee's.

But for them not to believe...

It-it-it doesn't matter.

Their own family
could tell them the truth.

It doesn't matter.

He came back... she didn't.

And now we've interfered
and we're...

we're all fucked.

-What an austere place.
-Tell me about it.

Well... all there is left
to do is drink then?

Yeah.

Now you're startin'
to get it, penman.

Mr. Hale, Mr. Hale, come here.

-Anne?
-Yeah, come here.

Mitch...

Don't bother with him right now.
Come here.

I have something for you.

Anne, am I dreaming?
What's goin' on?

Do you still wanna meet the
witness to the Hawthorne murder?

Yes.

I can't bring them here
because they don't want

anyone knowing who they are.

Especially,
a family member of the Lees.

I took a big risk
by coming here.

-Alright.
-Dane would kill me.

-Do you wanna come with me?
-Yes.

-Come on, we've to go now.
-Let's get Mitch.

No, just you. Come on.

Sshh.

Come on, Mr. Hale.
It's just up here.

Anne, why did you say
it's a murder?

What else would you call it?

Actually...

And hello, Dusty.

I'd call it an accident.

An undesired event.

Misfortune.

I'd call this misfortune.

Dusty, what are they doing here?

Where's the witness?

Shut up, Anne.

Shut and get-get
the fuck over here.

Come here.

Mr. Hale, I'm so sorry,
I had no idea.

It's cold now!

I can smell the poison on you.

You feelin' no pain.

That's good.

That's real good.

Joe... help me!

God, please, no.

I'm so cold.

-Joe.
-No.

No, don't get near me.

Jack's coming for you.

He's gonna get you.

You said you loved me.

You let me
be like this, I'm cold.

You said that you loved me.

God...

When I was 17, I went inside
for the first time.

I thought I was invincible.

I thought I had to prove
that I wasn't a punk.

So, I got to running my mouth.

In a place
I really didn't understand.

Wasn't long before
I caught a beef

with one of the other prisoners.

He, wanted me to mule
or somethin' for him.

I don't know.

I told him that
I'd kill his family

if he ever spoke to me again.

Few days later

about five of them
caught me off guard.

Beat me into a coma.

Clipped off my tongue
with a dirty shiv

and gave me this.

That was my punishment

for disrespecting

them in their house.

Annabel...

was the only one
who came to save me...

when I was hurt.

She said...

all this agony...

was just...

was just temporary.

"Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

No matter
how bad it gets, Jackie."

Okay, he says.

Okay.

A few years later,
I caught the same guy and...

I cut him open
from his ear down

to his ankle with a can opener.

It was his time
to learn a lesson.

So that was that.

Don't do this.

Don't do this.
You're accountable.

You're all accountable,
you hear me?

You're all fucking
accountable!

Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

Please... please.

Now...

which hand do you write with?

What?

I said...

which hand do you write with?

My left.

-That one?
-Yes.

Wait.

Don't hurt more, please.

What? What?

-Where's my shiv?
-Right there!

No. Please.

Please, please,
don't do that, don't...

Help me!

What?

What, little brother?

Too much?

I bet it was a dream.

And those...

are dreamed by night...

or awake.

I was dreaming I think.

Or cognizant of many things.

We should skip those.
Only dream.

Would it not be
incredibly remiss...

if I'd have done sooner
with this crime.

You come bearing gifts.

Stay alive and live,
my good man.

Step in.

Step in there.

I didn't have anything
to do with that.

-Shut up.
-Are you kidding me, Dan?

-Are you serious?
-Lock it up.

I wasn't even there,
I was with these guys...

-Take your medicine, Dane.
-Are you kidding me?

Take your medicine.

This is bullshit, Dan!

For fuck's sake!

Yo, beluga.

Sit the fuck down.

Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Unlock that door!

Unlock the gate!

Alright, come in. Back in
the cell, back in the cell.

Hey!

-You see the boy?
-What?

He's hidin'.

Maybe a neighborhood kiddie.

I chased him,
but he keeps coming back.

My God! Joseph did you
sleep out here last night?

Since Wednesday.

It's Saturday.

Did you see something
that scared you, honey?

She acts differently lately.

-It's my fault.
-It's alright.

Let's get you
cleaned up, honey.

-No!
-Enough!

Joseph, you stop acting
like this right now!

Jack and Ruddi were released
from jail this morning.

They attacked Ed Hale last week.

They couldn't hold them
'cause he-he was too afraid

to tell anybody what happened.

Now, those men are gonna
come after you, Joseph.

And if you're gonna
stay like this

it's gonna be
really easy for them

to say that you disappeared
or had an accident.

So we're gonna go into town...

and we're gonna leave Bodega
Bay for a couple of weeks.

We can stay in Redding,
Tom can look after your house.

-Get up!
-Okay, okay, I'm gonna go.

I just gotta get inside,
get some stuff.

I'll meet you at Nickel's
in a... half hour.

How the hell
are you gonna do that?

You-you've been out here
for almost a week!

I have to!

Thirty minutes...

or I'm coming right back
to get you.

Okay.

What's up, dog?

What the fuck
are you guys doing?

Jesus Christ.
You scared the shit out of me.

When did you guys get out?

I was just coming by
to lock up, I was, I was gonna

go hunting up North,
I was gonna check and see

if you guys need anything
before you hit the trail.

Hey, hey. Hey! Come on, no!

Guys, come on!

Where's Jack? Hey! Where's Jack?

I wanna straighten things out
with him, okay?

I just wanted to wait for him
to cool down a bit!

Does he know you guys are here?

Come on, guys.
Ruddi, knock that off. Please.

Grab a hammer,
get the shit off my window

and let me out of here!

Put that...
Put that down. Ruddi!

Ruddi!

Come on,
I did my part, alright?

I kept my secret!

I didn't say anything that he
wouldn't have already heard!

Ruddi, put that...

Ruddi.

Ru-u-uddi!

You heartless coward!

Come, let's walk out of here!

It's me.

It's just me.
Did you hear the truck?

Looks like there's a big fire
out at Mitch's place.

Tom just headed out that way.
I don't like this.

I'm telling you,
something is going on.

It's not everyday the penman
strolls in the town.

It's big deal to people,
Mr. Hale.

He's a sick man and a recluse.
Do you want his story?

You take him out of here
like you did

with the Boyle brothers
in Indian country.

What am I missing?

Their own family...
could tell them the truth.

It doesn't matter.
He came back, she didn't.

Glory?

Glory!

Glory?

Jesus Christ, Glory!

Glory?

Hi.

It's Jack.

Hi.

Must be a fire?

I think it's over
at Mitch Captree's house.

Captree? Is that so?

They better
get some people up there fast

before it all
gets scorched?

Please, don't hurt my dog.

What?

I would never hurt an animal.

I love her.

She's my friend.

She should be inside.

Animals just know, you know?

They're not like us.
They're not like people.

They don't have
to experience everything

through pain and suffering.

Why did you come here?

I wanted to apologize to you...

for the other day at Tom's bar.

I... probably made you feel
a little uneasy.

Yeah? That wasn't my intention.

What was your intention?

To send a man to the hospital

just for doing a story
about your family?

I can't control my brother.
I tried!

I tried, I tried, I tried

and I tried again!
It doesn't work!

You know,
Joseph's not the only person

being persecuted
and judged in this town.

I wasn't even there!

-You weren't?
-I was not!

So you're not
going after Joseph.

Why would I?
It won't bring my sister back.

Will it? No.

No.

I said what I needed to say.
That's it.

Can I have my dog back, please?

Of course.

Come on. Come on, sweetie.

There you go.

Easy, go easy.

Thank you.

-So beautiful.
-Thank you.

Thank you.

What, that?

That's just ink and immaturity.

That's nothing,
that's not gonna hurt you.

Come on, I just wanna be
treated equal.

Just like Joseph.

Friends?

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Okay. Now, come on.

No!

Look at this hair.

You look like her.

Yeah.

I can see why he likes you.

Hi, Mr. Hale,
how are you feeling?

Good. Listen, I need you
to tell me something.

It's very important.

When you booked
my room out here...

how did you find
Mitch Captree's place?

Captree? Um, let me see.

You know what?
He actually contacted us.

-Mr. Hale?
-You know what, Bill?

This isn't
rocket science here, okay?

'Cause anytime
any shit goes down...

Motherfucker!

Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

-Knock it off. Alright.
-What'd you mean, knock it off?

Don't jump to conclusions.

Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

Don't tell me
that was an accident, Billy!

Don't jump to the conclusions,
Tom, alright?

-Let's just stick to the facts!
-What happened?

It was Ruddi and Dane.

You fucking let them out?

I couldn't hold them any longer.

You didn't wanna identify them,
Mr. Hale.

Sweetie.

Over here!

Hi, Joseph.

Hi, it's me, Annabel?

Your long lost love.

I need you to save me.

Save me from the water.

Save me from the whales, Joseph.

-Save me from myself.
-Where is she?

You really wanna know,
you big...

-Yes.
-Why?

Why?

So you can go rescue the girl

and save the day?

Are you a fucking idiot?

You're a fucking idiot.

Do you know
what Jack is gonna do to you

when you go down there?

He's gonna beat you to death

and leave you face down
in the water.

Is that what you want?

Is it? I don't think
that's what you want.

Stop it! Stop.

You know what I think
you want, Joseph?

I think you wanna
stay here with me.

We can go find
Viagra and back.

It's gonna be fun.

So much more fun
than you're gonna have.

-Shut up!
-You're my husband.

Tell me where they took her!

I like it when you get rough.

I fucking like it!

Okay.

Do it the hard way...

hero.

They...

are where the lie started.

Where you killed
my best friend.

I think you know exactly where
that is, don't you, Joseph?

Dusty.

You're an ugly person.

Well, lucky for me, Joseph

'cause we know what you do
to the beautiful ones!

We're on highway three
right up here.

Know this place like
the back of my hand.

It-it's a lie, it's a lie!
They set me up.

They sent me because
it's hard to get out of here.

It's a lie! God!

Get back! Get back!

-Dane!
-Shut the fuck up, Tom!

You wanna help this asshole?

Then you're a fucking asshole,
too! You're fucking get me?

No one gets through
but Hawthorne!

And you, you fucking silly boy,
pussy, motherfucker!

Did you get the story
you wanted?

Did you get the story
you wanted?

You're...

You're right,
it's just so fucked up...

that you can't even
jerk off, can you?

My God! I...

No...

You...

-Ed?
-Is he alright?

-I don't know.
-Come on, get him on.

Hey. Here, listen up.

You gotta get to town, okay?
You gotta get the sheriff.

-Get him out here.
-Okay. Okay. Alright.

Am I gonna get in trouble
for hitting him like that?

You're fine.
You did the right thing.

-Go.
-Okay. Okay.

Ed?

-Did he change, Anne?
-Go!

-Did he change?
-Get help! Go!

-Did he change, Anne?
-Hey! Hey! Look at me.

-Did he change?
-Look at me, not at her!

Look! Can you
get your arms around...

Can you get your arms
around this? Hold this!

You gotta hold it! Listen. Hey!

Look at me.
This isn't a game anymore, okay?

-No, no, no, I don't...
-If Ruddi...

-Listen to me!
-I don't want this!

If Ruddi and Jack come after
you, you gotta drop 'em, okay?

Otherwise, they're gonna
kill you. You understand me?

You gotta go a quarter mile
down this road, you run.

Lawman's bluff,
below the field, okay?

You're gonna
cut through the cliffs

I'm gonna meet you there.
Now, go.

Come out, you fucking coward!

Where are you,
you fucking pussy?

Come on!

Hey.

Help me!

Joseph, please help me!

Come on in! Come get her!

Wait!

-Sweetie!
-Joseph!

What's wrong, bro? Come get her!

So cold. She need you!

Well, I'll help you out.

You bastard!

Go on ahead.

I'll make you a deal.

Be a man...

and come get her...

and I'll go. Careful.

Don't let the water
get you, Joseph.

Is that how hard you tried
for Annabel?

Now there's blood in the water.

Somebody...

Somebody help!

Hi. Come back, bird.

No, no, no. Come back, bird.

Back to your cage.

Hey! Hey!

Should have known better.

Should have left, writer man.

Should have left
when you had the chance.

Help!

Thought you were
supposed to be smart.

Where you going?

Help!

Hey, hey.

Hey.

I need you to...

I need you to do me a favor.

I need you to...

tell my sister...

I'm gonna quit drinking
in the spring.

No!

I can't have my sister back

but I can have you.

Joseph! Please...

We'll do this together.

You and me together, right?

You saw her go...

now I'm gonna watch you go.

Please! Stop!

Jack! No!

Let her take you.
Just let her take you.

Just let her take you
at the sea like you...

like you...

Telling him to fight there,
were you, piece of shit?

Let's lose the shiv?

Joseph!

Help! Somebody, help!

Ed! Ed!

Shoot him!

-Wait. Wait. Wait.
-No!

-Where you...
-No!

Let him go.

No!

-Let him go.
-No.

I've missed you, my friend.

-Whale.
-Joseph!

The girl on the boat.

Your imperishable love.

Tell me.

Yes.

Honey!

Honey, look out there.
Do you see?

This is why we came! Look!

Hey, honey, how you doing?
You ready?

Come on, we're so close.

Look, it's why we came out here.
Five more minutes.

-Five more minutes.
-I'm not, I'm not standing up.

Will you look at how amazingly
close we are. Look.

Do you see them?
We've never been this close.

Come on, honey.
Just walk up with me.

You can hold me the whole time.
I got you. I got you, I swear.

-I just not...
-Last request, please.

Come on, look who...

You're gonna love it. Come on.

-Hurry!
-Just, just be careful, okay?

Look! Look out there.

There are three of them.

-It's amazing!
-Yeah.

Have you ever seen a whale
that close before?

No, no, no.

Hey, don't. N-not over...

Well, they're coming
right towards us.

My God!

Look at that.

You can almost touch them.

Be careful!

I'm fine, honey.
Just hold on to me.

I know you like it, baby,
but you gotta be careful.

I'm not gonna fall.
You've got me, don't you?

-Yes.
-And you got the boat.

-We're gonna be fine.
-Okay, okay.

Okay, look.

I didn't kill my wife!

Annabel!

I love you!

You're ready to swim with me,
my friend.
