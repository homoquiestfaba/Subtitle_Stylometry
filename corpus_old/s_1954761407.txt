Drew: Welcome to
"whose line is it anyway?"

On tonight's show...

Shaken, not stirred...
greg proops.

With a twist of lime...
wayne brady.

On the rocks...
colin mochrie.

In a coconut shell with a little
umbrella... ryan stiles.

I'm drew carey, your host.

Come on down
and let's have some fun.

Hello.

Welcome to "whose line
is it anyway?"

Where everything's made up
and the points don't matter.

The points are useless,

Like keith richards
to a vampire.

Ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

Let's show you
how funny it gets

By playing a game called
"let's make a date."

Wayne, you're going
to be appearing

On a dating-type show.

Ryan, colin, and greg
are the contestants.

We've given them each
a strange quirk or identity.

You have to guess
who they are.

Off you go.

Bachelor number one...

Yeah.

I...

[ laughter ]

I love a man

Who is physically fit,
has it in the right places.

Well, isn't that
great for you?

Halle-bloody-lujah.

I'd like to know
what you do

And what type
of physical regimen you use

To keep your body
in shape.

Well, all work
and no play...

Makes for a dull time.

Bachelor number two.

Yoo-hoo!

Yeah. [ crunching ]

[ slurping ]

After I finish
with a hard day's work...

Excuse me. Excuse
me. I enjoy...

We're over here.
We're over here.

Hey, want to get out
from in front of me?

Sorry. Oh, sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

After work, I enjoy
doing pottery to unwind.

How do you unwind
after a long, hard day

Working 9:00 to 5:00?

Oh, you know.
I don't know.

This sucks!

Bachelor number three.

Yes, I can hear you.

Come on.

When I was
the darkest child

In my village in sweden
growing up,

We... we used to drink

Cocoa and celebrate
our ancestors

That came before us.

What did your ancestors do?

They took a bullet
for me.

Well,
bachelor number...

Sit down!
Bachelor number one...

You're back to me, wendy.
How great.

When I was a small child,

My mother told me
to be with a man

Who would take care of me.
How would you take care of me?

Oh, I'd take care of you
real good.

Here's your boyfriend!

Bachelor number two.

Yeah. [ hacking ]

[ makes shooting sound ]

[ imitates cellular phone
ringing ]

Yeah? What? I'll be there.

Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

Yeah? Yeah?

Bachelor number three...

Bachelor number three,
I love america.

What do you love?

I love a good cigar,

Just like
my number one guy here.

[ buzzer ]

Did someone say
black leather?

[ makes shooting sound ]

I don't know how you're
going to guess who they are.

Bachelor number one
is, uh...

Oh, my gosh.

Well, take a guess.

No... oh, jack nicholson.
Jack nicholson.

Bachelor number two

Is a really rude moviegoer.

Yes.

And ryan,
as bachelor number three,

Is a, um, is...
is, uh,

Is secret service
to the president.

Yes.

All right,
that was great.

I'm going to give you
1,000 worthless points.

Let's go on to a game called
"let's make a date."

Wayne, you're appearing
on a dating show...

Oh, we just did that.

Excuse me.
Captain alzheimer?

Go to the third card, drew.

Go to the third card.

What is...

Greg's next job?

So let's go on to a game

Called "film dub."

This is for ryan,
greg, and colin.

They're going to supply
their own soundtrack

To a film
we picked out for them.

The scene I'd like you
to improvise

Is a marriage in trouble.

You're going to make up
the words for the people.

Greg: Hello, darling,
how was your day?

Ryan: It wasn't very good,
thank you for asking.

Did you go out shopping,
get around much?

I've been busy being
a mad scientist,

But you don't respect that,
do you?

You just lay there
and laugh at me.

Tell me where you put
the rest of my body.

I've had enough of you.

I'm going to make
a pizza.

I used to make pizza
for you long, long ago.

Yes, and I... oh!

Colin: Buy an encyclopedia!
Buy an encyclopedia!

I don't want
an encyclopedia.

You must! I'm working my way
through choreography school!

It's that damn
neighbor kid. Ohh.

Well, now you know
how I feel.

Sorry, darling,
just trying to be disarming.

Drew: All right.

That was fantastic. I'm going
to give you 1,000 points

'cause some idiot's
keeping score

And he wants to know
what the points are.

We get letters, folks.

Let's go on to a game called
"film, tv, and theater styles"

For ryan, colin, and wayne.

I need different styles
of television,

Styles of movies,
or styles of tv.

[ shouting out suggestions ]

Porno, "star trek,"

Animal planet. Okay.

Man: South-of-the-border
soap opera.

Oh, a mexican soap opera.

<i>Novelas.</i>

Anybody else?

Oh, "gladiator" movie.
That's a good one.

Okay, we got enough.
That's good.

You guys are going to start
out a scene normally,

Then I'm going to make you
do these different styles.

Ryan is a speeding motorist,

And you're pulled over
by wayne,

A motorcycle cop...
officer wayne...

Who discovers colin
tied up in the back.

Ha ha ha.

That's a Friday night.
As usual, yeah.

Whenever you're ready,
go ahead and start.

[ imitating motor

You'll never catch me.

Hyah! Hyah!

[ buzzer ]

Drew: Porno.

[ grunts ]

Oh!

I'm sorry
I broke the law.

You, are you okay?

I'm feeling
much better now, officer.

[ humming porno music ]

[ buzzer ]

I don't know why I'm
going to this one,

But animal planet.

[ australian accent ]
I've been tracking this guy

For the last 5 miles.

He's had
my good friend colin

Locked up in the back
of his boot.

I'm going sneak up
and wrap a rope around him.

I hope he doesn't
bite me.

[ making eating noises ]

[ buzzer ]

Drew: "star trek."

It's all right.
Oh, thank you.

[ buzzer ]

We'll be back with more
"whose line" after this.

Don't go away.

<i>welcome back to</i>
<i>"whose line is it anyway?"</i>

Where everything is made up
and the points don't matter.

I had a rough night last night.

My blow-up doll ran off
with my air mattress.

It was quite a night.

Moving on to a game

Called "themed restaurant."
this is for all four of you.

Colin and wayne,
you're two businessmen

Having a power lunch
in a themed restaurant.

Greg and ryan are
the maitre d' and the waiter.

The theme of the restaurant
is an emergency room.

Go ahead
whenever you're ready.

Wayne: Uh-huh.
Right. Gotcha.

Listen, johnson,
I'll make it flat.

I'll put it on the table,
and you take it.

Let me call you about
that. Okay, fine.

It's you.

Oh, yes,
we would like...

Gentlemen, have you
been served yet?

This table, stat, now!

Let's get some service
over here!

Have you gotten menus
yet? No, we haven't.

Did someone order wine?

Sure, I'll take some.

Is everything
to your liking so far?

Well, so far.

So far?
Not excited? Clear!

I need 15 hemoglobins

Of scleboglobin
for this man right here.

Right.
Here's our specials.

My god! You've got
a spot on your lung.

What? Oh, my god.

Quick, get a liver
in here.

Let's take out his.
All right.

How would you like
your liver done?

Uh, well?
Well done?

[ makes electrical
charging sounds ]

[ making
heart monitor sound ]

Breathe, breathe, breathe.
You're doing fine.

[ makes flline sound ]

Oh. There we go.

I just want
some salad.

Salad? He needs the heimlich
maneuver this instant!

Off to the salad bar!
Out of the way!

[ crying ]

It's all right.

Never mind about him.
He... he lost his dessert.

That's right,
he lost his dessert.

Look, all I want
is some chicken.

Here's your bill.
It's $25,000.

What?

He's gone.
He's gone.

I'm off dutyow.

Waiter!

[ buzzer ]

Drew: All right.

I'm giving you
300 points apiece for that.

I'd give you more, but I'm
dipping into my own stash.

Ha ha ha.

Let's go on to a game now
called "song styles"...

"greatest hits."

Man, I am one step
behind...

Greg: This is for all four
contestants.

Wayne will be
choosing a date,

But they're not exactly
what you think.

Well, let's go on

To a game called
"greatest hits."

This is for colin,
ryan, and wayne

With laura
and linda and cece.

Colin and ryan are
tv voice-over guys

Talking about the album
they're trying to sell.

Wayne is going to sing
the songs they make up for him.

We need a job
where you wear a uniform.

Shouting out suggestions ]

Zookeeper,
that's a good one.

Let's do
"songs of the zookeeper."

Hi, we'll be back
to your movie

"out of africa"
in just a moment,

But first, have we got
a deal for you.

You know, since noah,
there have been songs

About animals, zoos,
and zookeepers,

And we have compiled
the best

Of all possible
animal-related songs

On this...

A very little cd
that has

Over 150,000 songs on it.

That's right, colin,

Including that number one
miami...

Wait.

Apparently we have
a special bonus.

It's one of drew carey's
cue cards,

Which has never been read.

Some of these songs
say a lot.

I remember a protest song
out of the '60s

That I had on a record
in the '60s.

Wow! What kind of
a strange coincidence is that?

That 1960s protest song
simply, simply titled...

[ imitates elephant
trumpeting ]

[ folk music playing ]

â™ª yeah â™ª

â™ª people, they say that you â™ª

â™ª just can't learn â™ª

â™ª but my best friend,
he's a big pachyderm â™ª

â™ª oh, what can,
what can I do? â™ª

â™ª but I'll tell you what â™ª

â™ª horton heard a who â™ª

â™ª and they go...[ trumpets ] â™ª

â™ª oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª save my friends
'cause my friends go â™ª

â™ª [ trumpets ] â™ª

â™ª ooh-ooh â™ª

â™ª [ trumpets ] â™ª

â™ª save the elephant â™ª

Thank you very much.

[ trumpets ]

It's wonderful,
isn't it?

And if you order
right now,

It'll still take four
to six weeks to get it.

You know,

Animals and zookeepers
have not only

Inspired the tango,
the macarena,

And a waltz
somewhere in pismo,

But...Who could forget
the 1953...

Polka hit...
Polka hit...

"beers and slavs"?
"beers and slavs"?

[ polka music playing ]

All the animals!
Jumpin' jiminy, come on!

[ audience clapping along ]

â™ª the only way
to fill the trough â™ª

â™ª is get all the beer,
invite over the slavs â™ª

â™ª slavs are very
fun-loving guys â™ª

â™ª they love to hear
the animal cries â™ª

â™ª slavs like oink!
And slavs like whoo! â™ª

â™ª and slavs like
hunh! Hunh! Hunh! â™ª

â™ª but most of all
when you come near â™ª

â™ª slavs, they love their beer,
hey! Hey! â™ª

Good night.

You know, colin,
there's a lot

Of great artists
on this cd set,

But there's only one
that earns the name of diva.

I'm talking about
miss diana ross

And her rendition
of "please don't feed."

[ r & b music playing ]

I know...

I know when you
come to the zoo,

I know you want
to feed everything, but don't.

I'll hurt you.

â™ª baby, baby â™ª

â™ª don't you know
it's no bull? â™ª

â™ª baby, baby, baby â™ª

â™ª don't feed the animals â™ª

â™ª if you do â™ª

â™ª I would get real pissed â™ª

â™ª just like the other day â™ª

â™ª when I got frisked â™ª

â™ª don't feed the animals,
not a thing â™ª

â™ª no, not the lion,
'cause he's the king â™ª

â™ª don't feed the bear
'cause he'll take off your arm â™ª

â™ª if you feed the hippo,
you'll come to bodily harm â™ª

â™ª don't feed the monkeys,
no matter what you do â™ª

â™ª he might get irate,
start slinging poo â™ª

â™ª don't feed the giraffe
'cause he's too tall â™ª

â™ª I think I've got them all â™ª

â™ª don't feed the animals â™ª

â™ª stop!
Feed the animals â™ª

We're going to find out
who the winner is after this.

welcome back to
"whose line is it anyway?"

Tonight's winner
is everyone but greg.

We're going to do "props"

We're going to divide up.

Me and ryan are going

We got to get some props.
