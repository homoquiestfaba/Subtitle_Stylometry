Great. Gunshots. Perfect.

It's just a backfire.

Like you'd know.

Face it, man. We are Lost.

Hold on a second.

We're here.
Where the hell are you?

Why don't your bitch ass
Look behind you...

and see what's crackin', man?

l got this.

Let me see it.

"Let me see it"?

Let me see it, man.

Show him the fucking money.

Show him. Show him.

Where is it?

You think I got it
in my pocket, man?

Yeah.

I can't go get it, man.

Y'all might be the po-po.

l ain't no po-po.

You got to get it yourself, man.

It's around the corner,
down the block...

by the...
What's that, nigger?

Loose brick,
north side of the building.

Go, man. Bounce.

Let me go on record, Jason.

This is a really bad idea.

There it is.

Nice.

It's easy as pie...

and twice as tasty.

Man, someone's screwing
with my car!

Come on.

Come on, in here!

I saw them go in.

This is a waste of fucking time.

Come on.

Forget it.
There's no way they're in there.

Trust me. I've been
working here for 20 years.

There's nobody in there.
Let's go.

Fucking donut shop shuts
in Less than five minutes.

All right.

Oh, God damn it!

Let's get the hell out of here.

Dude, that was close.

Yeah.

What the fuck was that?

Fuck.

Where'd it go?

l don't care.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

Go!

Go, go, go! Come on!

What the hell was that?

Hey, you!
Get away from there!

Get!

Dude, Let's get out of here.

I'm right behind you, man.

Oh, man.

Palmer!

Somebody help me!

Somebody help!

"For outside are
dogs and sorcerers--"

Revelation 22: verse 15.

-Hey, check it out.
-Jimmy, over here.

Yeah. PLace your bets.

What's your number?

That must be your birthday, huh?

Get your money right.
Put it in here, baby.

Let's get these numbers running.

-You all right?
-Yeah.

This looks Like a damn graveyard
around here, bro.

This neighborhood's
making a comeback.

Where the hell has it been?

This is the ugliest building
I've ever seen.

l don't know.

There's something about
this building.

It just drew me.

All right,
you know something?

I was planning
on doing this...

after I got the place
cleaned up and whatnot...

but, like the man says,
carpe diem.

What do you think about this,
Little sis?

That's us.

"llLbient"?
Whose club is that?

Ours.

What do you mean, ours?

Like I said, ours.

Come on, check it out.

-Ln this?
-Yes.

Patrick,
what are you thinking?

This is prehistoric.

Can you picture it, though?

Look, we could have
the bar right here.

Dance floor.

-Yo, Bill.
-What?

DJ booth, right there.

Anything's possible,
but that's a Lot of work.

Oh, Jesus.

Tell me that's part of a dog
or something.

Yeah, that's dog.

That's from a cat or something.

It's a pretty big cat,
Patrick.

Cat, dog, whatever.

l got a really great deal
on this place.

A really great deal, man.

They couldn't give it away.

It was dead meat stinking up
their books for 20 years.

Don't do that, Maurice.

Stop playing, man.

Chill.

The Last owner on the Lease,
before the bank...

was back in '79.

Some cat named Jimmy Bones.

It's been empty ever since.

Jimmy Bones?

-You heard of him?
-You haven't?

Not that I can remember.

He was a Local Legend
back in the Seventies.

Sure.

There was a song--

Sing it for me, baby. Come on.

Let's do this. Ready?

This is the story of Jimmy Bones

BLack as night and hard as stone

Sorry.
Something about a deuce.

A switchblade and...

A switchblade and a diamond.

Get yourself a couple of dollars
and buy a piece of candy.

Say, "Thank you, Uncle Jimmy."

Thank you, Uncle Jimmy.

Jimmy Bones.

Aw, Maurice. Jimmy Bones.
How bad-ass is that?

Jimmy Bones!

Patrick, I'm going
to tell you something.

I'm sold, baby,
and I'll tell you why.

This is what I'm thinking.

We could use this whole
Jimmy Bones theme...

to make this place off the hook.

Look at this place, man.
It's a dump.

Actually, it'd have
to work to be a dump.

Look at the rest of the place
before you tear it down.

l know it's cold.

I'll run downstairs,
fire up the furnace...

see if I can warm the joint up
a Little bit...

and you'll see.

This place has
serious potential, man.

Potential to Leave me
seriously injured.

I'm gonna check out how to get
the DJ equipment up there.

Who's coming?

Aw, man.

Aw, shit.

Am I trippin'?

I'm going this way.

Yeah, me, too.

No, you won't, buddy.

You're going
to follow me upstairs.

Tia, be careful.

Oh, shit!

Fucking rats.

PLease don't bust,
because I can't afford that.

What's up?

Contact paranoia.
Maybe you heard of it.

I'm buggin' from hanging
with you all the time.

l tell you, goddamn, man.

Well, I got bigger problems.

l can't get this joint Lit.
That's drug abuse.

Things are nuts down here
without you squawking that up.

Maurice?

Bill?

Hey...buddy.

How Long you been
Locked in here?

Want my burger?

Damn, you were hungry.

You want us to move in here?

That's the only way we'll get
the place fixed in time.

Yeah, right.

And whichever of us
is alive by the end of week...

inherits all
of Vincent Price's cash.

You want to play college radio,
high school reunions...

and some fooI's club once a week
for the rest of your Lives...

that's cool,
but I think we can do better.

l put everything I got
into this...

because I believe
we can make it happen.

We move in. We take shifts.

Enough with
the motivational speech.

I'm down, all right?

Thank you.

He has a good track record,
so just go with him.

Fine. Mars needs
a Little bit of Venus.

Lf I'm going to sleep
in a spook house...

surround me with chicks
more scared than me.

Speaking of which...

Why would you say that
about my sister, man?

-Oh, shit.
-Look who I found.

What? Tia.

That's the nastiest dog
l ever seen.

He's not as ugly
as some people I know.

Anyway, I'm naming him Bones.

Bones?

Let's go get the stuff
we need and bring it back.

-Shotgun.
-Shotgun.

-l said it first.
-No, you hear things Late.

By the way...

Dad does know about this, right?

Are you kidding?

Patrick, man--

It's going to be cool, bro.
I'm telling you.

Hey!

What y'all doing over there
with that dog?

Ls he yours?

Ls he yours, sir?

Hell, no!

What do you care, then?

I'll tell you something, boy.
Shoot that dog.

Shoot the dog?

Whatever you say, sir.

l think it's nappy time.

Come on, Bones.

Tia, put him in the back.

Don't feed that dog!

What the hell's wrong
with you?

Some holes can't be filled...

and some hunger
can't be satisfied.

Some people need to stagger
their medication.

I'm serious!
He'll only get hungrier.

Come on, Cynthia.

Y'all people
really don't Like dogs.

Ma'am, you need any help
with those bags?

No, thank you.

Really, Let us help.

We just moved
into the neighborhood.

We're going to be neighbors.

Let me help you out.

You moved onto this block?

Not really to Live,
but to play.

See, I'm a DJ, right?

Ln that building?

It's going to be Le hot shit.

Pardon my Fran√ßais.

We're making it a dance club.

Ever heard of
the Resurrection Brothers?

Should L?

Are they on the radio?

Nah, but they will be.
They're the best.

How do you know?

-l manage them.
-It's us.

And you bought that building?

Wait a minute.
You Look a Little familiar.

Are you sure
you're not from around here?

l was born near here...

but after my mom died,
Dad moved to South.

l grew up in Rossmore Park.

You're a Little dark
to grow up in Rossmore Park.

Yo, she's fine.

l guess this is not
Rossmore Park, but...

thanks for the help.

Hey, anytime.

Here.

l guess
I'll be seeing you, then.

It was nice to meet you.

Lf she has psychic powers...

how come she's working
here in Desolation Row?

Come on, man.

What happened to the Colonel?

A gangsta of Love
don't eat no fried chicken.

Why not?
You eat everything else.

The whole chicken distribution
network is owned by the KLan.

Man, don't even go there.

When's the Last time
you seen a black chicken farm?

Yeah, special recipe.

There's something in the batter
that makes a black man sterile.

-Bullshit.
-Now hold up, man.

Why are you so concerned with
the plight of the black man?

Last time I checked,
you was not black.

l don't know
exactly what you are...

but you damn sure
ain't no black man.

l am the future, all right?

l am the meIting pot.

You been smoking pot.

I'm the tossed salad.

l am
Martin Luther King's dream.

All I got to do
is hold my own hand.

l am post-racial.

You're post-toasted.

Post-apocalyptic,
more Likely.

You're making my head hurt.

Just eat your food.

Eddie, man, what's wrong, nigga?

How many times
l done told y'all, man?

When I'm playing
this game here...

don't interrupt me.

We just hooked you up
with a tight Viper.

We are paid, nigga.

Viper!

A Viper?

A Viper you stole
off them white boys Last night?

Yep, yep, yep.

Like that, nigga.
Just Like that.

Are y'all out
your motherfucking mind?

No.

Man, everybody heard
that damn screaming...

Last night on BLackstone.

Remember that shit?

How many times I told
you two knucklehead niggers?

No psycho shit.

Lf there's going to be
any psycho shit...

I'm the one that do it.

We know that.
We respect that.

That's why we didn't do shit.

You didn't Ginsu them punks
and steal their ride?

Steal their ride.
That's all we did.

That's all we did.

Man, get that car
the fuck away from here...

you understand?

This is the type of shit
I'm talking about.

l pay the pigs good money
to keep shit cool around here...

and this is the shit
that pisses everybody off.

Boy, if I didn't know
your mama--

We just thought--

No more thinking
from neither one of you!

Because I will burn your asses
and snort your asses.

Now get the fuck out of here.
Beat it.

And do something
with your hair, nigga.

Get out of here.

What make a motherfucker
take his real teeth...

and put--l don't
understand that shit.

You're just
a misunderstood genius.

Dad is going to kick ass.

He doesn't Like dogs in
the house in the first place.

All right. I told you so.

Hey, you guys.

Hi, Mom.

Tia...what's this?

-It's a dog.
-l can see that.

Why'd you Let her bring it in
in the first place?

She's hardheaded.
She don't Listen to me.

Excuse me.

Let me see
if I've got this right.

Not only do I have to feed
the three mouths I've got...

plus Maurice
the bottomless pit...

l have to feed
this stray dog, too?

Bones, it's not nice to bite
the hand that feeds you.

What did you call him?

Bones.

You cannot keep that dog.

Hey, hey, hey.
What's up, Jimmy B?

What's going on, blood?

l got it all arranged
for you tonight, Jimmy.

Eddie Mack's
going to be there...

and Officer Koruptsky, too.

Got it all Laid out
for you, baby.

They've got 12 minutes, tops.

Jimmy, trust me on this, man.

There's some big money
behind this, baby.

Not just big--
l mean big business big...

Like big corporation big,
big government big.

One word,
three Little Letters--

Y-e-s. That's all
it's going to take.

We can move out of this dump,
hit the big time--

big houses,
Legitimate business, the works.

That's your dream, not mine.

l don't ever want
to Leave this street.

Never.

Status quo is totally
cool with me, baby.

l hear you, Jimmy.
I'm with you, baby.

-Be good.
-All right, baby.

l hear you, Jimmy.

You got all the status...

and I ain't got nothin'
but the quo.

Officer SLupovich...

aka Loopy Lou.

It's not your styLe...

is it, Eddie Mack...

killing off
your customers?

l ain't killed nobody.

You want me to rack 'em up?
PLay a game?

Too bad.
No time to play today.

Got your tip.

Confiscated the whole stash.

That's fair enough...
for the shit.

Don't you think I deserve
something a Little extra...

for knocking out
the competition?

Shit, you was just doing
your motherfuckin' job.

The Last thing you need...

is for me to start doing
my fucking job.

Give that motherfucker
his money.

That's more Like it.

That's the cost of
doing business.

Maybe you can deduct it
on your taxes.

Fuck you.

What's up with Jeremiah
selling that building?

What?

That's ridiculous, Patrick.

So how exactly did crack
get in the ghetto, Pop?

By magic?
How did it fly in there?

Like the man said,
we don't own that many planes.

Stop poisoning your mind
with that ghetto paranoia.

That's the ways of people
justifying their own failure.

No, no, no, Dad.

The man has been Lying to us
for a hundred years.

Thank you.

I'm still waiting for
my 40 acres and a mule.

You wouldn't know a mule
if one bit you in the ass.

Personally, I don't need a mule.

I've got myself a Lexus.

And nobody gave it to me.

PLease, Pops--

I'd Like to see the news,
please.

...in the strange
disappearance...

of those two State College
fraternity brothers.

Now, Patrick, I'm telling--

SLick.

What is that?
What's that all about?

-Nothin'.
-What were you gonna say?

Some terrible shit, Pops.

Better watch your mouth, boy.

Those boys had no business
messing around down there.

You go places where
you're not meant to be...

and that's what you get.

Lsn't that your old hood, Pops?

Yes, that's my old hood...

and it took some doing
to get out of there.

You just be glad that I did...

so you can start your Life
here instead of down there.

Shouldn't we
maybe be down there?

Doing something about it,
making it better?

It can't be done, Patrick!

That place has already
died and gone to hell.

Want me to get that, honey?

No, I'll get it.

Al Lupovich.
Long time no see.

I'll be just a second, honey.

What the fuck do you want?

Wanted to visit
with my old pal J-Bird.

Don't call me that.

That's quite a brood
you got there.

A regular Rainbow Coalition.

What the hell do you want,
Lupovich?

You sold the building.

What building?

Don't shit a shitter.
Our building!

You were supposed to sit on it,
not sell it.

l didn't sell it.

Somebody bought it,
so somebody sold it.

Not my problem.

That's a bozo no-no, J-Bird.

Even if they find anything,
it's been 20 years.

They could never
trace it back to us.

You better hope not,
'cause it's Like they say...

four can keep a secret
if three are dead.

Daddy?

Hey, Tia.
I'm just talking to a friend.

I'll be right in.

Nice rack.

How old is she?
Does she...you know?

That's my daughter, Lupovich.

Get the fuck off my property.

Your daughter.
Nice to see you.

You fat bastard.
Son of a bitch.

Got it. And twist.

l don't know what we're gonna
do with this place, boy.

It's all good.
It's ugly, but it's home.

You know that's bad Luck, right?

That place is bad Luck.

Why's that?

l don't know.
It goes way back.

Or so my mother says.

What else does your mama say?

You know, nothin' much.

Lf I told you,
you'd think she was crazy.

And one thing
my mother is not is crazy.

OK. So?

All right.

l can't believe
I'm telling you this.

My mother says
that every house is two houses.

Every street, two streets.

Two's good.

There's a whole city,
a whole world...

kind of beside, on top...

just below...

the city of the dead.

There's this invisible wall...

a fabric that keeps
things separate.

Lucky thing.

Sure is, but when
something bad happens...

something really bad...

the wall breaks, tears.

And the dead get out?

Or the Living fall in.
Who knows?

And you believe it?

Lf I did, do you think...

I'd come within
50 yards of your door?

Get out!

Y'all better stop
messin' around!

Go, boy!

What the fuck!

Freak!

What's the matter, bro?

Are you spooked?

Maybe just a Little,
all right?

l know. There is kind of
a strange vibe up in here.

Make yourself comfortable
around the circle.

We will begin in just a moment.

You gonna join us?

Can't. Gotta finish
this for school.

God gave you the vision.

l hate to see you waste it
on painting pretty pictures.

You got your vision
and I got mine...

and I won't waste mine
Like you did.

Sorry, Mama. Maybe next time?

l don't want you to go
to that house anymore...

and I want you to stay away
from those kids and that dog.

That dog is a servant of evil.

Ever been inside?

Yeah, back in the day.

Before it became what it is.

And what's that?

It's a bad place...

and a door to worse.

l gots to T.C.B. tonight...

so I should be through
about 7:00.

Come see me.

Can't I get there early
and give you some good Luck?

No, baby. You know
l don't need no Luck.

I'm just Letting them
have their say...

before I tell them no.

All right,
Let me see your hands.

Come on,
Let me see your hands.

-Come on, baby.
-PLease?

All that readin',
advisin', shiny mess...

that was your mama's bag.

It was my mama's bag
and her grandmama...

and a Long Line of mamas
before her.

Sounds Like Mama needs
a brand-new bag.

Let me see your hands.
PLease?

Your Left hand is the past...

your right hand
is the present and the future.

This is your Life Line,
and this--

Jimmy, there's a Line across
your Life Line.

Must be my clothesline.

Maybe my phone Line.

Jimmy, I'm serious!

Cancel the meeting.
Don't go. Stay with me.

Don't you worry
about nothin', baby.

These hands will be
stroking your neck tonight.

Jimmy, please!

Pearl, trust me.

Thought you might be
needing some help.

Look at this, man.
It Looks Like blood.

The floor's throbbing.

Aw, snap.

It feels Like a heartbeat.

It's just a problem
in the plumbing.

You're probably right...

but I'm gonna check it out...

and y'all are coming with me.

Come on.

-Whoa!
-Damn!

What is this?
Look at this, man!

Maurice,
what you think that is?

It's rust. Rust never sleeps.

You call that rust?

Now where does this go, huh?

Don't ask me.

Now what?

Eat that spinach, boy.

-There you go.
-You got it.

I'm not going down there.

Go ahead, Tia.
I'm right behind you.

Don't get behind me.

Just some flies. Come on.

What is that smell?

What'd you expect, Cynthia?

Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

FLies, there's shit!

Disgusting!

Space that's so perfect
for a recording studio?

Maurice, not now.
Just shut up, man.

He got a point, though.

It'll just take a Little more
work than I thought.

Think about it.
Put down a real floor.

Put some dampening
on the wall...

we'll have
totally controlled sound.

It'll be perfect.

We'll make our first record
where no one can hear us scream.

Be afraid. Be very afraid.

Oh, my God!

Oh, shit.

Give me some Light.

Hello. Who are you?

Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

I'd Like you to meet
Jimmy Bones.

What are you talking about?

"This is the story
of Jimmy Bones...

"black as night
and hard as stone.

"Gold-plated deuce
Like the king of Siam...

"got a switchblade Loose
and a diamond on his hand."

There's the switchblade
and the diamond, man.

You telling me
this could be him?

Damn. It's so fresh.

Put that thing down!
What are you doing?

You can't take that.
It might be evidence!

Evidence of what?

Patrick, doesn't it seem
a Little odd to you...

that he'd stab himself
in the chest and bury himself?

l agree.

Bones, settle down!

Do something about the dog.

What we have to do
is call the police.

For someone so cute,
you're so stupid sometimes.

Call the police,
we don't get a permit.

We can't just Leave him,
can we?

-Yes, we can.
-What?!

He ain't goin' nowhere.

We will deal with this
after the weekend.

-Let's go!
-Fuck it, whatever!

You put your fingers
all over it!

Maurice,
I'll Leave you down here.

I'm coming!

Cyn?

What?

You all right?

Yeah.

Come on. Let's go.

Patrick, what up?

I'm coming.

-Come on.
-I'm coming.

l guess
he won't be needing this.

Or this.

Well, you know
she doesn't want me here.

With you...in this house.

Whatever.

It's true.
She doesn't trust you...

and neither do L.

l can handle your mother.

-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

She will Love me, watch.

No, she won't. Trust me.

See, but the X-factor
is your daddy.

l don't know nothin'
about him.

Neither do L.

l never met him.

She won't talk about him.
Ever.

Wow. I'm sorry.

Don't be. It's OK.
I'm not sad about it.

It's Life, you know?

I've never known him,
so it's totally normal to me.

I'm not doing too well
with this.

Yeah, you are.

Patrick, stop.

What?

l can't.

All right.

Do you want me to take you home?

No. I want to stay
with you guys--

No, no, no.

You don't have to explain.
l understand.

I'll go sleep with the guys.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

'Night.

Welcome...

my brothers and my sisters.

We will begin with our hymn.

The spirit world is
all around us at this moment...

and the dearly departed
are here...

among us,
pressing around us.

It's OK. You can stay.

But no getting fresh.

This is nice.

There is a spirit among us.

Who has just joined our circle?

Lordy, what is that smell?

Stop. Patrick, cut it out.

Does someone
want to send a message?

Knock once for yes
and twice for no.

Ls it someone in our circle?

Stop.

Ls it Miss Lillian?

Cut it out.

Ls the message
for Miss Abernathy?

Patrick, stop.

Ls the message for me?

Patrick, stop! Stop!

No! Jimmy! No!

Patrick, stop!

What's wrong?

That sounds Like your mom.

Open up this door!

What the hell are you doing?

Where's my daughter?
l want to see her now!

You hold on a moment,
I'll go upstairs--

Come on out here!
l know she's in there!

Cynthia!
Oh, God! Come on, baby.

It'll be OK.
We're gonna get outta here.

Come on.

Lf you stay in this house
one more night...

you might as well
be sleeping in your grave!

Come on.

You certainly have
a way with women, Patrick.

Well, we're in business.

What?

Where we going?
You know I hate surprises.

It's a Little business venture
l made on my own...

l wanted to show you.

l think you will approve.

l hope so.

l hope so.

What are we doing down here?

Like you always said...

we need to Look for
the undervalued.

It don't get no more
undervalued than this.

Come on, Pop. Just come on.

Bet you didn't know
your company owned this place.

l went through a broker,
so you didn't know it was me...

but I couldn't wait
to see your face...

when you saw
how I fixed it up.

Look at this.

Son, is this
some kind of sick joke?

No! Look, Pop.

You Listen to me, boy.

l didn't work
all of my goddamn Life...

to get out of
this neighborhood...

for you to move
right back in it!

l thought you'd be proud of me.

I'm just trying
to do what you did--

take nothing and
make something out of it.

Nobody will ever
come down here, son.

Look at this
fucking neighborhood!

Son...shut it down.

Shut it down.
The company will buy it back.

No. Not this time, Pop.

l did this on my own,
and we will open tonight!

Bullshit!
That is bullshit!

Sell it back!
That is a fucking order!

Do you fucking hear me?!

Shut it!
You shut it, god damn it!

Shut it down
and sell this fucker!

Shut it, Patrick--

What's goin' on, baby?

Jimmy's into it, man.

That's what I'm saying.
Just wait.

Jimmy, what's happening, baby?

Good to see you.

You remember Eddie Mack,
don't you?

We met.

We did the afterschool
b-ball thing at Kenwood.

What it is, homeboy?

What it will be.

Jimmy, you know
Officer Lupovich, right?

I've heard of him.

Man, you got a nice crib here.

It's nice to see
a black man doing so well.

Everybody's happy.
We do all right.

But things change.

You gotta think ahead.

Got them Lotteries
all over now, Bonesy.

Starting here, too.
Maybe next year.

Yeah, Jimmy.
A Lot of our old customers...

are getting their new people
across the state Lines...

buying those Lotto tickets.

We need to get
on this thing fast.

What do anybody want with
them damn Lottery tickets?

What else, youngblood?
Money.

No, man.
It ain't the money.

It's the high.

The big fat floating
"What if?"

Dig, it's way
more profitable, man.

Nobody ever wins,
so you never pay out.

But a $2 bet is cheaper
than a $20 bag.

l can dig that,
but I'm not talking horse.

I'm talking
a $5 kick in the head...

that's a quick ticket
to heaven, man.

And fools keep coming back.

All right, baby.

Those fools?

They're my people.

l can dig that, man,
but it ain't no thing.

It's a poor man's freebase.
Check it out.

l ain't interested,
and if you gonna sell it...

don't sell it around here.

Man, here, just try it.

l said, no, thanks.

-Man, try this!
-Hey, Huggybear!

l done drove all this way, man!

Hey! Back off.

Sit down!

That's cool.
I'm copastetic.

But it's Like this here, man.

It's the wave comin', man.

A big-ass, Krakatoa,
east of Java wave.

Either you gonna be on top...

up here in
chocolate heaven...

or you'll get caught up
in the muddy undertow.

And that's real.

That's beautiful, baby.

Totally widescreen
sci-fi forward thinking...

and I can dig that...

but that's for you and yours.

Me and mines...

we cool as a motherfuckin'
icicle in the freezer.

By the way,
your 12 1/2 minutes is up.

Sorry about that, J-Bird.

It's never business,
it's always pleasure.

It's cool, Jimmy.

Did you see this motherfucker?

No, no, no.

Fuck it.

-Hey, Jimmy, Look.
-Yeah, baby?

Just hear me out
on this one.

Pass up the money train
and jump his ass on the bus.

His Loss.

Hear me out on this.

Don't need nothing Like that.
We cool.

Drop the piece, homeboy.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Drop the piece, nigger!

Eddie Mack! Come on, baby!

Lupovich, baby, just be cool.

Everybody just be cool.
Baby, be cool.

Be cool, man.

Jimmy, man, just hear it out.

Just hear out the deal.

l don't need to hear no deal.

l don't need no new partners...

l don't need no new product...

and I damn sure don't need
this cracker's...

Saturday night special
in my face.

Just try it. That's all.

You heard the man.

Try it.

All right, baby, that's good.

Heat it up!

Like that, Jimmy?

Just Let it kick in, baby.

Gonna be nice, Jimmy.

Oh, my God!

God damn it!

Don't fucking move!

My one good suit!
God damn it!

Tell her to shut up!

Get your punk ass

Tell that bitch
to stop screaming!

Stop fucking screaming!
You hear me?

What fuck are we gonna do now?

Shut up and Let me think!

l need this Like I fucking
need a hole in my head.

l am not the only one
in this room...

with that nigger's blood
on my hands.

Get his knife.

Everybody Leaves a print.

We hang together,
or we hang separately.

Now cut him and cut him good.

What it is, homeboy.

What it will be, nigger.

Now you.

Hey! Now you!

J-Bird, help me, brother.

I'm sorry, brother.

Since we was grasshoppers.

Like you said.
Every man for himself, baby.

Hey, Shaft, it's your turn.

Hey, don't even think about it.

Man, hurry up!

OK, mama, it's your turn.

l won't do it.

Either you cut him...

or die with him.

l Love you.

All right,
Let's clean this shit up.

Take this and bury it with him.

Come on, move!
Get him out of here.

Bet you wish
you took the deal, nigger.

Damn!

Does your mama know
that you're here?

What my mama don't know

Hey, can you take
a Little extended solo...

-From what?

Patrick.

Bullshit.

For once, tell me the truth.

Look, I saw your face.

Now, you knew that place,
and you knew those people.

Man, this is

My soul? Fuck you.

Let's see if these gates

when his past comes callin'.

We have to save him.

Save who?

Can Jeremiah come out and play?

and what it will be, my brother.

And it will be your ass.

How the hell

How the fuck I got in here?

Oh, my God, Jimmy.

Dad!

What the hell

Somebody please tell me--

Yeah, right.

It makes me feel better.

Where are you going?
l just called 911.

Then we really gotta go,
'cause I can't explain this.

I'll be back,
hopefully with Dad.

-We're coming with you.
-No, you're not.

You gotta stay with Mom !

Jesus fucking Christ,
what is this place? Oh, my God!

Shut the fuck up.

You two bitches were just meat.

You never had any idea smarter
than getting yourselves...

a Little bit more.

But my brother J-Bird, here,
this nigger was smart.

He didn't just want more.

He wanted more
with compound interest.

Come on, Jimmy. PLease, man.

-Get Lou.
-Get him.

Get that fucker.

Bye, Loopy Lou!

-It's the blood.
-What, Mama?

Remember when I told you
that a person...

has more than two parts,
they have three?

Body, soul, and spirit?

The spirit
Lives in the blood...

and the spirit keeps
the body and soul together...

and sometimes
the spirit Lives on.

Jimmy's blood
must still be in that building.

Let's go.

Look here, Jimmy.
l got $20,000 saved up, buried.

Don't nobody know
where it is but me.

You can have half of it.

All right.
You can have it all, man.

Come on, man.

l really don't--

Jimmy! Jimmy!
Come on, man, Jimmy!

And now, J-Bird, my brother...

it's time for you
to collect your interest.

This is it.

We found that skeleton
right down here.

All right, it was here.
Right here!

-What'd he have on?
-Nothin'.

No, wait,
there was a green rag.

My god, my dress.

My bloody dress.
We gotta burn it.

We gotta close the door.
Find my dress!

The blood on the dress
is keeping him alive!

-l couldn't find anything!
-Look for it!

You was my main man.

Since we was grasshoppers.

l always Looked after you.

You had a piece
of everything I had.

l didn't want
a piece of yours, Jimmy.

l wanted my own.

And fuck everybody else, huh?

God damn, Jimmy!
Think about it, Jimmy.

Lf it had happened to you...

you would've done
the same goddamn thing, man.

Nah, brother.

l wouldn't have done
any manner of what you did.

It's a trip, ain't it?

Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

-Baby, you OK?
-She's all right.

-Be careful!
-Oh, hell, no!

Bill, slow down! Be careful.

Don't get hurt. Be careful.

Oh, shit.

Watch your step.

Stay back.

Come back!

Find Jeremiah!

Mama, come back!

Tell me, Jimmy.
What will it take, huh?

What do you want?
Just tell me, Jimmy!

Oh, man, that's easy.

Think you can give me
my Life back?

Can you swing that, brother?

You know I can't do that!

You're fuckin' dead!

Dog eat dog, brother.
Dog eat dog.

-We can climb out.
-Where?

Anywhere but here.
Come on, man. Let's go.

Turn around, baby.

You know I always Loved you
in this dress.

Oh, damn.

Come on, give me your hand.

Look out. You cool?
All right.

Did he create all this?

No, but he's a part of it.

This is...
the city of the dead.

We just have to remember
what was here and follow it.

Those stairs should take us
to the second floor.

Didn't I tell you, baby?

Didn't I tell you I'd be
strokin' your neck tonight?

l took out my revenge
'cause I had to.

Now stay here with me--
forever.

OK, where do we go now?

Oh, not now.

Come on!

Oh, my God.

Bro, where you goin'?

-Maurice, where you goin'?
-Bill, wait!

That's not Maurice.

Where you goin', man?

Where the hell you at?

He's gone.

This way.
