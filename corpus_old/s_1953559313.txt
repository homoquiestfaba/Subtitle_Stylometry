A tornado warning remains
in effect

for northeastern Johnson County

In east central Kansas

and southwestern Jackson County

in west central
Missouri until 9:45 PM

National Weather Service
Doppler radar indicated this danger

Storm was located
seven miles...

Ah! No!

God, help! God!

So is your mom home?

No, she's at her weekly
hair appointment.

You want to fool around?

Do you ever think
I'm gonna say yes?

Patience is a virtue

Mmm.
Well, you got one

Seriously though, you want me
to wait till she gets home?

No, I want you to wait
until I finish this cigarette

Remind me again
why I hang out with you

Cause you want to sleep with me

Oh yeah

Thanks again for helping me
cut geometry today.

Hey, I was leaving anyway

Besides,
I'm going to be a porn star

The fuck do I need geometry for?

Thank you

Hey, cheer up.
Your dad's coming home soon

Yeah, maybe he'll buy me
a GTO just like your daddy

Hey, I mowed a lot of yards
to get this car, okay?

My dad's yard

a lot of times.

All right, see you Saturday

So it's a date then?

Bye, Sean

I'm six-months sober as of tomorrow,

as a matter of fact

My wife's coming back to me

Hmm.
I get to see my kids again

I got you guys to all thank for that.

Thank you

Okay, I guess I'll go next

Uh, my name is Janet
I'm an alcoholic

and I've been sober
for four months.

Hi, Janet

Well, I should be happy right now

because my husband's coming home tonight.

He's in the military. He's been fighting
overseas for the last year and a half.

But to be totally honest,

I don't feel happy

I feel-- I feel really scared

Like I've been thinking about
all the things that he's seen over there

and everything
that he's lived through

And then he's gonna
come home to...

me.

I just thought that sobriety
was going to make things better

You know? I thought that
if I could just stop drinking

that things would improve

But it hasn't been like that at all

In fact I feel like every day

everything's getting worse
at home, you know?

I don't know, it's--
I've just been really selfish

I guess that's why
I'm here, you know?

I just-- I want to do better

I want to-- I want to be better

As these trained
weather spotters are continuing

to feed us and give us
the new information,

we'll make sure
to give you the updates

Stay tuned.
We will keep you advised

to this rapidly changing situation

Good afternoon.The National Weather Service

issued a tornado watch
earlier this morning

and things are going
from showers to thunderstorms

and getting a little more dangerous
across eastern Kansas.

You can see over the last few hours,

starting to see those colors
brighten up--

a lot more red on the screen
That is indicative

of the storm strengthening.

And really they're all converging
on eastern Kansas.

Several warnings have been posted

At this point, it is only
for hail and high winds.

But certainly,
as the National Weather Service

has issued that tornado warning

there is the potential
for some tornadic activity

as we progress throughout the day,

as all of this travels across
the state and to the east.

Areas west of l-35 look to be okay

But areas east of l-35

Girls, are you ready?

I thought you quit smoking

Watch your face

...a serious situation to a slightly
more dangerous situation as...

You ready?

No, I'm running away.
That's why I've packed a bag

Why are we staying
in Kansas City tonight?

Weather Channel says
there's going to be a storm

If your father's flight is delayed,
we might have to stay in a hotel

Then why don't we just stay here
tonight and go in the morning?

Because I want us to be
the first people your dad sees,

not some hotel desk clerk
Whatever.

County off to the east in Linn County

the situation is turning a little worse

We're going from the thunderstorms now,
severe weather.

Quite a bit of hail
reported down in Linn County

and that is indicative
of these storms strengthening

Once you see the purple, the bright

mobile homes and vehicles
should be abandoned

for sturdier shelter.
Otherwise go to an interior room

on the lowest level
of your home or place of business.

Make sure there are as many floors
and walls between you

from the outside as possible.

Repeating: A tornado warning
remains in effect...

Please, I've lived in Kansas
my whole life.

I've never once seen a tornado

You know you were born
during a tornado.

Yeah, I never heard that before

I can't say I remember much about it.

Ditto

Hey, Mom?
Can I change my name?

Why would you want to do that?

Sally is just so unprofessional

What do you mean?

Well, can I at least go by Sarah?

But your name's not Sarah
it's Sally.

Your father named you

Yeah, you were named
after Charlie Brown's sister

I was not, Jennifer!

Hey, Alice, how's your book?

It's fine

What's it about?

A lot of things

Like?

It's a bunch of short stories
They any good?

Haven't you read them?

Yes, but I want to know
what you think.

Magma?

A tornado warning remains in effect
They're fine.

...until 5:15 PM
Central Daylight Time

in Linn County in Kansas.
The National Weather Service

in Topeka, Kansas,
has issued a tornado warning

for northeastern Linn County
near Blue Mound, Kansas...

Mom, I have to pee

The National Weather Serv--

Sally, I told you to go before we left.

Hurry, gotta pee!

Sorry.
It's okay

You-- you all right there, ma'am?

Yeah. We're heading
to Kansas City tonight

Oh, I really don't think
that's a very good idea

There's a tornado ripping
thought Blue Mound right now

It's headed this way
Oh, really?

My husband's flight gets in
in a couple of hours.

He's in the military.
He's coming home from overseas tonight.

Well, I reckon he could
wait a few more hours

as opposed to his wife
and daughters having an accident

Where would we go?

I'm the wrong guy to ask.
I'm new here myself as of last week

But I'd be willing to bet
any of these old farmers

would let you hole up in their cellar

Looks like the townspeople are
really taking this storm seriously

You folks best get some shelter

Thanks

Need any help
closing up, Mrs. Shurman?

No, thank you, Barney

Carr, get those people out of here

Now you all be damned careful
out there.

Thanks

I can't believe
his name is Barney

A tornado warning remains in effect

until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time
in Linn County.

At 3:41 Central Day--

What is that?

A tornado siren

Hey, Mom?
Yeah?

12 miles west of Mound City

I'm sorry I didn't pee at the house

It's okay, sweetie

other locations in the warning
include Anderson County...

this storm is visible

...straight-line wind gusts
of up to 60 miles per hour.

...or place of business.
Make sure there are as many floors..

Mom,what's wrong?

Doppler radar indicated
a severe...

Everybody out of the car now!

In addition to the tornado,
large hail the size of quarters

Don't look!
Run, run!

...vehicles should be
abandoned for sturdier cover

Otherwise, go to

Hello?!Hello?!

Help! Help!

Mom?

Go, Mom, go!
Mom, hurry! Go, go!

Come on, come on!

Go go go go!

I'm scared

I think we're safe.
I think we're okay

Okay.
Jen, are you okay?

Yeah. Are you?

Yeah

Everybody

I'm fine

Honey, you're always fine

Okay, come here

Wow

That was intense

Don't tell Dad I cried

Oh, honey

It's okay.

Where are we?

You think the storm's over?

I think it's over enough
for us to leave.

Damn it.
There's a tree across the door

Shit, ow

Jennifer, can you help?

Oh, Shit-

Push, hard

Okay

Now what?

Come on.

Well, at least there's booze

sorry

Let's see if somebody's home?

Hey! Anybody up there?!

Help! Help!

Hey!
Hello?!

Shh, wait a minute.

] yam [mag
cellphone?

Oh, duh-

You got a signal?
Yeah, three bars.

It's roaming though
Is that okay?

Yeah, I think
the extra charge is okay

Nothing.

Nothing?
Are you connected?

Yeah, it connects.
It just connects to static

Who are you trying to call?
911.

Keep trying

If you push me up there,
I bet I could fit through.

Oh, honey.
Are you sure?

No, but if you break out
the rest of the glass, I'll try

Any luck, Jen?

No.

Try texting someone
Yeah.

Good idea.

Wow, you're fast at that

Who are you texting?

His name's Sean.
Yeah? Who's that?

He's a guy that would travel
through a storm to get laid.

Jen, please, the girls

Mom, please, I think we have
bigger fish to catch right now

Damn!

What is it?

Unable to send text message

Well, maybe it'll send
after the storm clears

Hey, will you send
a message to your dad?

Okay, you ready to try this?
Mm-hmm.

I'm gonna knock
the rest of the glass out

Dad, stuck in a cellar
halfway to KC.

Running late

Be there soon, Jen

Okay,"message pending".

Hopefully he'll get it soon

It's "fry," by the way

What?

You just said we had
bigger fish to catch,

but really it's bigger fish to fry

Oh, thanks

Sure.

You should talk more

Why?

Because you're smart

Are you ready?

Yes.

Is that--

Do you think they heard us?

I don't know how
they couldn't have

What the hell?

Why would they do that?

I don't know

What was that?

I'm willing to give
that window thing a try

Yeah. Come on

It's throbbing,
it's throbbing inside!

Go get something
to wrap her arm! Go now!

Oh my--
Help me!

Help me!

What is all this shit?

Rope

rope-

Okay, let me see, let me look

This is soft

Come on.

Here here

Ow, don't! No!
Shh shh, oh baby

It's okay.
Hold still, hold still

Shh, there

It's okay, sweetheart

I won't tell Daddy
you cried, I promise

What did that to her?

I don't know

Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah.

We just-- we just need
to get her to a hospital

right away.
What happened to her?

I don't know

I think maybe--
I think maybe she got bit by a dog

Mom, did you see her arm?

I know

What?

It didn't look like a dog

Of course it was a dog.
What else would it have been?

It just looked--
it just looked too clean--

Jennifer, please

We need to-- we need to get her
to a hospital right away.

Shh, Mom-

Ah, come here

It's okay. Here, I want you
to stay with Sally.

Come here.

Here, I'll help

Push.
Oh, it's giving-- okay

Yes.
Come on

The windows!
Get through the windows!

What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

Let us out!

Where the hell are we?

What now?

I don't know

Sally is passed out

Someone is...

keeping us here.

Please help.

We are

in Wellsville."

Hey, Jen, we need
to clean Sally's wound

There's water
Where?

On the shelf in the corner

Okay, let's go get some

Another storm?

Yeah

The radio said
it's going to storm all night

I'll go get that water

Come on.

Oh my God.
I wish your dad was here

What is that smell?
It's not water.

Wow

Definitely not water

What is it?
I think it's moonshine

What? Why?

That's alcohol

I'm gonna use it to clean her wound
and it's gonna hurt like hell.

Help me hold her down

Okay, sweetie. Here we go

Ahh!

Ow, Mommy!
Mom, stop it. You're hurting her

Mom!
It's okay, Alice

I'm sorry.

Mom!
I'm sorry

I'm sorry.

That's it.
That's it. Stay still

It's gonna be okay
I promise.

Promise.

Jennifer?

Stay with me

I will, Sally

I wont let anything happen to you,okay?
in

I love you, Jennifer

I love you too, Sally

Just go to sleep now
and rest, okay?

We're gonna find a way
to get you out of here.

You okay?

Mm-hmm.

There's got to be a way
out of this basement.

Maybe a door that leads upstairs?

Is there a flashlight or something?

I don't know. Maybe

Hey, Jen, do you have your lighter?

Oh.

Uh, no-

It's in the car

Jennifer?
Check Sally's pockets

What?

Promise not to be mad at Sally

course.

When we were in the car, she took
your lighter out of your backpack.

Really?
Yeah, she thought maybe if you didn't

have your lighter,
you wouldn't smoke

Are you serious?

Yeah, check her pockets?

I don't believe it.
Sally saves the day

I promise, Sally

no more cigarettes, okay?

Jen?

Hello, Barney.
Hi, Mrs. Shurman

Well, goodness sake,
get yourself out of this weather

You'll catch your death
Thank you, ma'am.

Can I get you a cup of coffee?
It's still warm.

That'd be great. Thank you

Are you baking something?

Cookies before the power went off

Want one?
Oh, sure.

Looks like the tornado
went right through.

Lot of trees and power lines down

It'll be a hell of a clean-up effort
around here.

Hell, it isn't even over.
Gonna storm all night

That's what I heard.
Gotta love this time of year

I never get used to it.

Makes people crazy in this town
Yeah, I noticed.

I'm surprised you weren't
holed up in your cellar?

Waiting for the storm to pass

Well, I prefer to wait it out up here

And bake?
It calms my nerves.

Uh, Mrs. Shurman, real quick
the reason I stopped by...

Yes?

Well, there's a car out front

Oh really?
Yes ma'am

It belongs to a couple ladies
on the road up to Kansas City

And I was wondering
if you'd seen them.

You don't say?
Well, no, I sure haven't seen 'em

Mmm.

Mrs. Shurman, their car
is out in the ditch by the road

Mmm, perfect

Well, I sure hope they're all okay

Are you sure they didn't stop by here?

It just seems like this would be
the first place they would check

Well, not unless
they got here before I did

How many of them
did you say there were?

There were four of them actually

There was a mother
and three of her daughters?

Oh my.

And you say they were
on their way to Kansas City?

Yes, ma'am, to pick up
her husband at the airport

Hello, Barney.
Out checking the roads, I see.

Hey, Sheriff!
I didn't know you were here.

I just stopped by to help her
board up her cellar.

Oh, yeah, I was going
to ask about that.

Looked like you got it
boarded up pretty good

Don't want a flood down there

Lots of valuables
in that old storm cellar

Yeah

Sure.

Well, I'd better get back
out on the road.

Horseshit. Stay inside here
and have another cup of coffee?

You know, Albert, I would love to,

but those travelers
really got me worried

They probably just went down
to Jacob's farm up the road.

Yeah, I'll check there

You sure I can't talk you
into another cup of coffee?

My, those lights seem
to have a mind of their own?

I'm sure they'll have them
up and running soon enough

Yeah. Thank you
for the coffee, Mrs. Shurman

But I really should
go check on those ladies.

You be careful
out there now, Barney

and don't forget to say hello to that
beautiful new bride of yours.

Will do. Now you folks
get some candles lit.

No telling how long this will last
Oh.

Oh my!

You forgot your cookies.

Oh. Wow! What are they?

They're little tornadoes

Cute.

Good night, folks

If something happens,
you're explaining it to his wife

Shouldn't have married him
in the first place,

especially a month into storm season.

Here, let me

Is this for Dad?

Yeah. These storms are harder
on him than they used to be.

Roger?

Settle down

Is he getting a case of cabin fever?

Just a little restless.

I'm surprised that you grew out of it

You used to be a real handful
this time of year.

Storms really don't affect me
the way they used to.

Teeth hurt a little--
that's about it.

Now you get that
from my side of the family

I wish your brothers
were more that way.

If this supercell they keep
talking about gets any closer,

I might not be able to control myself

I'm gonna let Roger and the boys
out for a while tonight

to enjoy the storm

Hershel's already out.
Well, you know Hershel--

always was a free spirit

He took a bite out of one
of our visitors earlier.

And Tommy?
In the cellar.

The storm got to him early

I was hoping that new
muzzle will help him.

You know they make
those things for kids

and they never work right anyway

I had to chain him up and give him
some extra moonshine to calm him down

Probably won't stay
that way for long though.

It's a shame about
that family down there

They seem real nice

ls there somebody out there?

Hello?
Hello?!

Hello?

This is Deputy Carr
from the Wellsville Sheriff's Department

Oh, thank God. Help us!
We're trapped.

Well, hold on, I'll see
if I can get you out.

What the hell
are you doing down there?

Get us out of here
Are you okay?

My daughter needs help

Hold on, I'll get the woman
who lives upstairs.

No!
What?

She's the one that
locked us down here

All right. Let's get you
the hell out of there.

Take my hand. I'll pull you out

Alice, you first

<i>Ahhh!</i>

Hello?

Hershel, calm down!

Creepy

Oswald triplets

Where are you

Sally is hurt bad

A cop tried to help

Help

Struck by lightning

Hey, I think I found
a hallway or something

I'm gonna check it out

Okay, I'll go with you

No.
What?

I said no

Then let Alice go with you

I want you both to stay with Sally
No, that's stupid.

You're not going down
a dark hallway by yourself

Jennifer

I can stay with Sally.
It's not that big a deal

I don't want to leave you alone
I'll be fine.

Is it just me or does that
sound like a terrible idea?

Yeah.
You're right.

We all stay or we all go

Then we all go

How long is this tunnel?

Must be 100 yards

What is it?

I think it's a still

Jen, careful with your lantern

Why?

If that's a still
and this is a propane tank

it could explode

Alice, I need you to stay with Sally

We'll be right down the hallway
so if you nee something,

-just yell,okay?-Okay

Mom?

Yeah?

What do I tell Sally
when she wakes up?

Tell her everything's
going to be okay.

Is that true?

Alice, with every other
beat of my heart,

I believe we're going to be okay

Okay

Okay

It's not so bad

No, it's just-- it's just awkward

Really

Okay, do you want to go
forwards or backwards?

I'll go backwards.
Can you get the lantern?

<i>Mm.'</i>

Ready?

Wait wait.
What what?

I need to change my grip

This could be a process

Ready?
Yeah.

Okay, back up

All right.
Okay, you go first

Okay

Mom?

Going too fast. Okay

Yeah?

You okay?

Can you see now?

That's good

Here comes the door

How's the ramp on your side?

It's good.

Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

All right, it's good

Don't go too fast
Sorry.

Wait, do you hear something?

What is that?

I don't know

Keep going.

That's it. All right

Mom, where's Alice?

Alice?

Alice?

Put the still there

Alice?

Alice? Alice?
Where is she?

Where is she?

Alice?

What the hell is this?

Alice?

Oh God, no!

Oh no!

I'm sorry. Oh, my baby

Oh God, oh

Oh God, no!

Mom?

We have to get out of here.

Mom, we can't give up

Jennifer

we're gonna die here

No, we're not

You still have daughters
who need you right now.

I won't give up

Jennifer?

What was that thing?

I don't know.
But next time we'll be ready for it

Mom?

Mom?

Give me a minute

Never mind

Mom, are you okay?

No, Jennifer

I'm not fine

Mom, I need you
to pull it together

Pull it together?
Your little sister just--

Mom, I'm thinking
about right now, okay?

And right now we need to put
that contraption in front of the door

and blow it off the hinges.

And I need your help

Do you hear that?

Uh-huh

Mom!

Jennifer?
Mom!

Oh God

Can you stand?

You gotta get Sally out of here

We're all getting out of here

Look at how happy Dad is

I haven't seen him
with this much energy in years

Should we let Roger out?

Give your dad a little while

Looks like that second storm
is coming after all.

It's gonna be strong

Then I guess that explains
all their energy.

They're gonna sleep
for a month after this

Where am I?

It's okay, Sally.
Jennifer, it hurts

I know, Sally

Where's Mom?
Right here, sweetie

Mom, are you okay?

Sally, Mom got hurt real bad

I'm fine

Where's Alice?
Sally, we have to get out of here

What's going on?
We need to leave.

I need you to cover
yourself, okay?

I-- what do you mean?
Where's Alice?

Alice is gone

She-- she's dead?

Yes. Now, Sally,
we have to get out of here

Can you walk?

Bleeding.

It's okay, honey.
I need you to be strong

and we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

We're gonna get Dad too, okay?

Come on.

I need you to get behind me
and cover your heads.

What are you going to do?
I'm gonna throw this,

you're gonna hide, okay?

Can you run?

I don't think--
If I help you?

<i>I'll</i> try
Okay.

Mom!

Mom!

Mom?

Mom, please wake up

Mommy, please!

Thank you, Mommy

Are you ready?

Okay

Are you okay?

Behind you!

Shit!

Jennifer!

Why didn't you just listen
to the weatherman for once?

Relax, all right? We're not
the only ones with trees down

It's gonna be fine

I told you to cut down
that branch last year.

What if it would
have hit the nursery?

It wasn't going to hit the nursery

Honey, come here

What the--

You girls okay?

She's cut up pretty badly

Let's get you guys inside
Come on.

All right, let's take a look

Oh, sweetie

We gotta get her out of here
or call the cops--

Shh.

It's gonna be all right

It does look pretty infected though.

You poor thing.
You don't understand

There were things out there that--
Just calm down.

I'm gonna go call for help

Let's get you some new bandages
Bathroom's this way.

Come on.

<i>Ahhh!</i>

Ah, hee hee hee!

Poor kid's teething
in the other room.

There's disinfectant
and bandages in the top drawer

Just take whatever you need
Thanks.

This baby's just
kicking up a storm

I hate when this happens
Excuse me.

Jennifer! Jennifer!

Sally! Sally, no!

Get away from me!
Please get away from me!

Jennifer, help me!
Jennifer, please help me!

Sally!
Ahh! Jennifer!

Jennifer!

I'm so sorry, Sally

There's no need to run, sweetie

We just want to have
a word with you.

Get the fuck back

You're lucky that the storm affects
each one of us a bit differently.

Otherwise you'd be dead already

Shit

This is where we
part company, dear

Shit!

No no no no!

No dead. But there's still a lot
of us unaccounted for--

mostly youngsters

But you know
how these storms go

Some of them just don't know
how to recover yet.

They'll find their way home
this afternoon.

Any signs of the girl?

No.

You think she's still alive?

No, she's gone with the storm

With this much damage,

there'll be news teams
heading this way.

We'll see

I'm sorry about your mother

More storms coming
in a few hours.

Could be worse than last night
