>> Morning Odie.
>> Morning Odie.

>> Here you go, boy.

>> Ah.

>> Well, I guess I'll go
shower and shave.

>> Thanks for sharing thatwith me, Jon.

Yes folks, this is my life.

While it may look vital andstimulating, it really isn't.

That's because Jon's a dork.

He really needs to get a life,and I intend

to help him find one.
Why?

Because Jon's my friend, and I'ddo

anything to help my friend, nomatter what.

Unless of course, there'ssomething good on TV.

Ah, time for my favorite show,Yukon Stinky.

This week, Yukon Stinky insultsa polar bear.

Can't miss that.
Eh, Jon's life can wait.

>> Well, Stinky, I guess thiscase is closed!

>> Give em heck, Stinky.

>> This is WBOR, the all

national anthem, all the timechannel.

Next, by popular demand, theCanadian national anthem.

>> And, if you're not completelysatisfied with your

Ajax nose hair tweezers,

we'll refund all your tweezednose hair.

>> Take that.

And that.

And that!>> Oh.

>> And that.If it's not too much trouble!

And if you don't mind!

>> That should be enoughstimulation for one morning.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

>> 141, 142, 143, 144.

Garfield, did you know thebedroom ceiling has 144 tiles?

>> The living room has 214.

>> I'm bored.

>> Why don't you organizeyour sock drawer?

>> I'd organize my sockdrawer, but I just organized

it last night.>> I'll be the judge of that.

Whoa, I'm impressed.

All nicely tucked and sorted, bycolor and size.

socks.

The summer ones are in the otherdrawer.

>> There's underwear.>> There's a bigger world out

there beyond the sock drawer,and I'm gonna live it.

>> Nice touch.

Haven't you got a life yet?

What are you waiting for?

Do I have to do everythingaround here?

>> How to make friends, andfool the rest?

>> Obviously, a book on
sincerity.

>> I forgot, I had this book.

Hey, this chapter on gettingdates, is just the ticket.

>> Great, read it and give mea full report.

The sooner you get happy withyour life,

the sooner I can get back tomine.

Humans, never satisfied.

Welcome to the Lorenzo School,

for the Personality ImpairedInc.

Remember our motto is, if youcan

get a pulse, you can get a life.

So the first thing we're goingto do

this morning, is check ourselvesfor a pulse.

If you don't have one, pleaseraise your hand.

Oh my, I see we have several.

Well uh, keep your hands up inthe air, while my

able assistant, Priscilla, willcome around

and give you a second opinion.

The first step to becoming avital person,

is to make a good
first impression.

Now, how do I do that, you mightask?

Well, I'll tell you how I dothat, you might ask.

You do that by walking right upto the person,

looking them right in theeye,

giving them a firm
handshake, and

saying, hello, my name is so andso.

Everyone, turn to the personnext to

you and give it a try, now.

>> Hello, my name is so and so.

>> Hello, my name is Jon.>> Hi, I'm Mona.

>> Hello, my name is
Garfield, you probably

noticed I'm quite short and haveexcessive body hair.

>> Was that okay?
>> Was what okay?

>> My first impression, Ireally

have no idea what I'm doing.

>> Oh, good.

>> Huh?
>> Neither do I.

How was mine?
>> Your what?

>> My first impression.

>> Oh, fine!I guess.

>> You guess? I knew it!>> What?

>> I have something betweenmy teeth, don't I?

>> Oh no, no, your teeth arefine!

See?

>> See what?>> I'm blowing it!

I'm making a lousy first
impression.

>> No, you're not!
I guess.

>> Yeah, what do we know.

>> The second part of today'slesson,

is learning to dress for
success.

>> Huh, I'm naked.

>> In all modesty, I mustconfess,

in some circles I amconsidered a fashion plate,

if you will.

Let me share a few of my fashionsecrets with you, now.

Rule number one, notice how I've

coordinated my pocket protectorwith my socks.

Well, my left one, at any rate.

When it comes to color, I thinksay, wear all the same color?

Your ensemble should be havevirtual smorgasbord,

for the eyes.

Notice how I've accented

my green tweet slacks with this

plaid jacket and this stringtie.

>> Why do I have this suddenurge, to play golf?

>> Nothing impresses peoplemore, than

when you speak in a foreignlanguage.

Say for instance, Canadian.

Now, this is an easy language tolearn.

You just talk like you normallywould,

except occasionally, you throwin an eh.

Example, I'm going to town, eh.

>> I am going to town, eh.

>> Great, let's all go totown, eh.

Maybe we can have some lunch,eh?

>> I was so shy in gym class,

I had my sister take my showersfor me.

>> I was so shy, I almoststarved to death once,

because Ididn't tell my dad I was hungry.

>> You're not shy.

>> Oh yes I am.>> No, you're not.

You're like that guy on thebeach yesterday.

>> Uh, what guy?
>> Oh, just some guy.

He was walking around flexinghis muscles, and

looking for his Olympic swimmingmedals.

>> You don't really have tolearn a

language, if you can sound likeyou speak it.

People are really impressed ifyou can speak French

or if you can sound like, youspeak French.

Example.

>> Oh.
>> Very impressive, no?

>> You know, I've had just

about enough sophistication forone day.

How about you?

>> Hey you, Monsieur dumbguy, remember me?

What am I, chopped liver?Duck pate?

Foie gras?

Why am I getting so hungry?

>> That's a funny story.

>> Oh, it's been a wonderfulday, Jon.

Class was great and dinner wasfun.

But most of all, I reallyenjoyed talking to you.

Until I met you, I thought I wasthe only person

in the world, to get my tonguecaught in an elevator door.

>> And we didn't even have tospeak French.

>> What?
>> Think about it.

We had a wonderful eveningwithout having to

rely on anything, we learned inclass today.

>> You mean, we can be
ourselves

and still have a good
time?

>> Mm-hm. It's a theory worthpursuing.

>> What a concept.

>> I know, I've been workingso hard

to be what I thought otherpeople wanted.

I almost forgot, who I was.

>> Well, I'm glad I met theyou, you.

>> Huh, I was fresh out ofother me's.

Do you know, I've never beenable to open up

to anyone like this before,other than my cat that, is.

>> Other than my cat, thatis.

My cat.

Yesterday, I had a name.Yesterday, I was his bosom

buddy, his confidant, today I'mhis cat.

I can't believe it.

Jon's actually met someone wholikes

him, and it's not even hismother.

What's this world coming to?

Who would have guessed?

Oh no.
Poor Jon!

He doesn't know, what he'sgetting into.

I must stop him, before hemultiplies.

>> Then in my senior year, Iwas voted

most likely, to sit around thehouse, a lot.

And then, Garfield, what are youdoing?

>> Let go of her, Jon.

Who knows where that hand hasbeen.

>> What a sweet cat!

>> Don't listen to her Jon,she's trying

to get to you, through me

>> Would you like me toscratch behind your ears?

>> Oh that's good, she's verysmart, Jon.

Once she has me in her clutchesshe'll perhaps,

just a little bit behind thisear.

Jon listen carefully, it's alla.

Just a little lower, this is alla sinister plot to

get you to
oh, yes there ah,

oh, yeah, yeah.

>> Excuse me.

>> You okay?

>> Oh, I'm fine really it's,it's

just that I'm, I'm allergic tocats.

>> Oh. For a minute there, Ithought

you said you were allergic tocats.

>> I am. I.
>> Oh no.

>> Aw, too bad.
What a shame.

She was so cute, and such a goodear scratcher, too.

Well, come along, Jon, saygoodbye to your little friend.

It's time to fix dinner.
>> This is terrible!

>> I, I'm sorry, Jon.

>> Can't you take shots foryour allergy?

>> They don't do me any good.

>> What can I do?

>> You can chuck her on thechin, say it's

been nice knowing you, kid, andsend her on her way.

>> What if I shaved my cat?

>> Hey, ho, hi, time out!Jon, what's with you?

>> Oh, Mona, you are so
sweet.

We could really have beensomething, you and me.

>> There's something to besaid, for seniority.

>> Can we still see each
other sometime, Jon?

>> I'd like that.
>> Good.

>> Not without a chaperon,you won't.

Jon's more than just a friend tome, he's my meal ticket.

>> Come on.
I'll take you home.

>> Hang on.

Wait for me. You're notleaving me behind.

There's more than one way toskin a cat.

So to speak.

I saw this on a freeway once.

>> I'm sorry I'm allergic toyour cat, Jon.

>> I'm sorry for us.
I like you Mona.

>> I like myself, when I'mwith you Jon.

>> What?
>> Mercy

>> No. That's Merci Bocu,>> Merci beaucoup.

>> No, Jon.
