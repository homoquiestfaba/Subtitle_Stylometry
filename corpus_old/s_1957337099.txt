[monster roars]

[wind whipping]

[man 1] Hey, Gibson. Come over here, mate.

[weapon thuds]

Whoa. You still lugging that thing around?

when Zorah Magdaros finally shows itself.

I mean, you really think you're gonna kill
a walking volcano monster with that?

This thing can supposedly level cities
with a wag of its tail.

Gibson, if half the rumors are true,

you may wanna count yourself lucky
that it hasn't shown itself yet.

We're the Fifth Fleet. Best of the best!
[laughs] I'll drink to that!

Zorah Magdaros
had better keep its head underwater

because no one's met the monster
that can handle Hunters like us.

[man 1 laughs]
[man 2] I have.

[heroic orchestral music playing]
I faced an Elder Dragon.

You have no idea what we're up against.

[river flowing]

[water splashes]
[gasps]


[grunting]
[monster cries]

Whoa! Aw, come on.

Lucky catch.

Enjoy your breakfast!

[theme music playing]

[Aptonoth grunting]

[teen laughs]

[upbeat instrumental music playing]

Morning, Mrs. Bellflower.

Morning, Aiden. You're out early.

You know what they say.
"The early Kut-Ku catches the Konchu."

I did not know they said that.

You and your monsters.


How about a Gastronome Tuna
for some Poogie Jammies?

[man 1] Not gonna happen!

[Poogie squeals]
Whoa!

Watch where you're going, Loke.
[man 2] Whoa! Nice move, Aiden.

You must be practicing.
[Aiden] You better believe it.

Thanks again
for clearing out those Bnahabra.

Hopefully,
these patches'll keep 'em out for good.


[man 3] Hey, have you seen Farmer Burl?

Ooh! Ebbi's been waiting
for you there all morning.

Something's gotten in Farmer Burl's coops.

Come on. We gotta go. It's a real quest!
[Aiden grunts]

What if it's Rathalos?

Did you know that Rathalos
have poisonous claws? [growls]

Yeah?
One scratch, and you're a goner.

got into Farmer Burl's Gargwa coops.

I'd bring some antidotes anyway.

Yes.

Whoa! [laughs]

Mrs. Genovan, look.


[Aiden sighs]

[footsteps echo]

[calming instrumental music playing]

[Gargwa clucking]

Just finished putting the new fence in
last week, and now look at it.

Tracks.

Velociprey, I think.

Can you take care of it?

Mr. Burl, you called
the "Right-noplos" guy for the job.

Because Rhenoplos, it's a...

With the horn? Never mind.

[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

[dung splats]


[bird calls]

[wind blowing gently]

[monster growling]

[Aiden] Huh?
[bushes rustling]

[monster snarls]


That's no Velociprey.

Come on!

[yelps]
[Velocidrome cries]

[Aiden groans]


Oh!

[tense instrumental music playing]

[Aiden screams, yelps]

[Velocidrome grunts]
[Aiden panting]


[arrow whooshes]
[Velocidrome cries]

[Velocidrome chomps]
[Aiden sighs]

[exhales, thuds]



[Velocidrome cries]




[Velocidrome screeches]


Ah. Whew.

[chuckles softly] That... That was close.

You're fortunate
the Velocidrome was alone.

They usually hunt
with a pack of Velociprey.

Yikes. The tracks
I was following were a Velociprey's.

Didn't think
I'd be running into its big brother.

Are you a Hunter?

You are, aren't you?

Like, a real Guild Hunter.

The last time one came through Timben,
I was, like, nine years old.

This is so cool. I'm a Hunter too.

I mean, well, I've never actually hunted
something that can hunt back before, but...

I'm Aiden, by the way.
My name is Julius.

You shouldn't be hunting
without a license from the Hunter's Guild.

It's poaching.
[Aiden] I... Well...

One of themÂ Velociprey...

What are you doing?

One does not take
a monster's life lightly.

To do so
would betray the balance of nature.

A Hunter has an obligation
to see its sacrifice does not go to waste.

Now, this village
you're from, it's nearby?

I'm not in trouble, am I?

I mean, <i>you </i>killed it, right? So...

Here's the thing.
The last time one of the villagers

got anÂ Altaroth infestation
in their basement,

Mitul had to walk all the way to Dundorma.

It took two weeks!

And then, when we finally met
with the Hunter's Guild,

they'd never even heard of
our village before.

There's no way
we can go for help every time a Kelbi

gets into the Cudgel Onion patch.

Ah. So you take it upon yourself
to sort things out.

I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.

Are these the Velociprey tracks
you were following?

Yep. Those are them.
Somebody's still gotta deal with that.

These are fake.

What?

And from the looks of it,

you have a Melynx
to thank for all your troubles.

Oh. When I find him, I'm gonna...

Aiden, later. The village first.

But... [scoffs]

This isn't over.

who makes decisions for the village?


Lived here
longer than there's been a village.

She's in the building
with Huskberry bushes out front.

I can show you where it is.
[Julius] I'll find my way. Take this.

[Aiden yelps, straining]

[Aiden grunts]
[Ebbi] Holy moly!

Keep an eye on that
for me, would you, Ebbi?

I'll be back shortly.

[Gargwa clucking]

Give it a rest, Feathers.
I'm not quite ready for you yet.

[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

[Aiden grunts]

Mm! A little Felvine for flavor.

[Aiden] Aha!
[Melynx yelps]

Don't you move.
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

Why, certainly, good sir.
Uh, how much do I owe you?

You're a... Wait, you can talk?

I thought wild Melynx
only spokeÂ Melynx or whatever.

"Meowst" do, uh, that's true.
But I'm not as wild as some.

I'm a merchant.

Nox is the name.

Really? Then what are you doing
with Farmer Burl's...? [yelps]

Why, you... Ow!

[Nox laughing]
[Aiden groans, grunts]

Hey! [yelps]
[Aiden grunting]

[Nox continues laughing]

Oh my...

Yeah, just put that anywhere.

Just don't hit the...

Oh! Come on!

That is precious cargo.
[Aiden grunts] Ow!

That was a limited-edition pot!

What kind of... Oh, real nice.
[Aiden continues grunting]

You "meowster"!

Come back here, you furry little felon!

[sighs]
[Nox yelps, grunts]

[Gargwa clucking]
[Aiden exhales]

Ah.

I don't suppose I could interest you
in an array of secondhand commodities?

[Nox, muffled] All right, 15, uh, 20%,
but that is the best I can do.

For the last time,
I'm not interested in your Zenny.

"<i>Your </i>Zenny."
Listen to me, buying into this Bullfango.

[Nox groans] Unnecessary.
[sighs] You're a thief.

I'm a Hunter, and bringing you in
is gonna prove to that Guild know-it-all

that I can protect my village.


You protect.
That's right.


How much more effective
would you be as a protector

if you could just protect them
with your very own airship?

Now, I... I know a guy...


[calming instrumental music playing]

[doors squeak]

Well, Mr. Burl, I've solved your problem.

I think
you'll be pleased to have these back.

My Gargwa!
[chuckles] Nice, Aiden.

Heck of a good job, son.

[Nox groans, coughs]
And the thief responsible.

Uh, hello.


Still think I shouldn't be hunting?

Yes.
[Julius grunts]

[Nox] Oof.
What's all this?

I was just explaining

that your village lies
in the path of an Elder Dragon.

What?

What does that mean?

Nothing good.

The Elder Dragons are the most ancient

<i>and powerful of monster kind.</i>

<i>Once enraged,
incredible energy flows from them,</i>

<i>warping ecosystems
in the places where they live.</i>

these creatures remain in one place.</i>

<i>However, during the periodic migration,</i>

<i>called the Elder Crossing,
they migrate across the continent</i>

<i>and over the great ocean,</i>

<i>leaving a path
of destruction in their wake.</i>

<i>Based on our reports, we now believe
they are all headed to the same location</i>

<i>over the sea, but we don't know why.</i>

[Aptonoth cries]


<i>these events were extraordinarily rare.</i>

[people scream]
[Daazel] <i>One in a century was uncommon.</i>

<i>It's now happening once every decade.</i>

the Guild summoned Hunters</i>

<i>to Port Tanzia to join a Fleet.</i>

<i>Their mission?</i>

<i>To find the cause
of the more frequent migrations.</i>

Hunters, like myself,

have been dispatched by the Hunter's Guild
to search for signs of the next migration.

I am here to tell you

an Elder Dragon is on its migration path,

straight for your village.

Holy moly.

You must evacuate now.

Wait a minute.
You expect us to just pack up and leave?

How do we know any of this is even true?

We don't know you.
I agree. What about our homes?

Did you think of that?
Homes? Homes can be rebuilt.

We're talking about lives here.
We should do as he says.

Some of us can't carry our livelihood
with us, Navid. I don't trust this man.

No, I don't either.
I mean, why should we listen to him?

It's true.

This valley is acting like a funnel
for monsters fleeing the Elder Dragon.

Most likely...
Most likely?

He's just guessing!

I believe him.

He saved my life.

Aiden, he's not from our village.

What if I go up there
and see this for myself?

Well, if <i>you </i>tell us
the danger is real, I will believe you.

Okay. I will too.

Then you will evacuate?

We have to know.

Take me there.

The Elder Dragon will pass
through the valley within a week.

I will take the boy

to see with his own eyes
the coming danger,

but there can be no delay
in your preparations.

You must be ready to leave
as soon as he returns.

We will begin at first light.


What are you going to do?

[villagers chattering]

[Nox yowls]
Now, what to do with you?

I may have use for him.

Huh?


Oh! [grunts]

[tense instrumental music playing]

[Burl groans]

[birds singing]

[monsters grunting and snorting]

Have you hunted Zinogre?
[Julius] Yes.

Diablos?
Yes.

[monsters buzzing]
[Aiden screams]

Ha-ha!

Aiden, no!

I had that one.

These monsters are no threat.

They're fleeing the Elder Dragon.

[Nox screams]

[swords ringing]

[Aiden panting]

There's something I don't get.
How come the Guild gets to decide

when and what people can hunt?

A dead monster's a dead monster, isn't it?

Most people once agreed with you.

Ages ago,
we hunted monsters indiscriminately

to the point where the natural balance
of life was disrupted.

The effect
on our environment was devastating.

It is this very reason
that the Hunter's Guild was formed.

Our balance with nature
is more delicate than you think.



They work separately, but always together.

Always on the offensive.

Overwhelming and outnumbering
one's opponent like two unrelenting foes.

The motion is fluid and precise,

like the flow of a stream.

May I?
Here. Try these first.

[rhythmic instrumental music playing]


[grunting, groans]

Concentrate on your center.
You need a stable foundation.

[Aiden sighs]

Don't worry.

We may make a decent Hunter of you yet.

[Nox panting] Hey. Hey, guys. Wait.

Isn't this distribution
of baggage just a little unfair?


Nice armor.


It's 100% iron ore.

Velocidrome-tested.
Works as a weapon. Got good balance.

Campfire cookware.

Perhaps you need to look the part.

This could fit.

[gasps, chuckles] Thank you.

[skillet clangs]
[Nox yowls]


Come here.
[Julius] Aiden.

Come on. Bring it in.

Um, no. No, Aiden.

It's okay. Don't... Don't touch me.

In case you were wondering... [yawns]

...there's nowhere you can run
that I won't be able to track you, Nox.


[rustling]
[Julius] Mm-hmm. And get out of my bag.

I'm not. I'm right over here.

[rustling in bushes]

What?

I don't see anything.


[Velociprey screeches]
[footsteps approaching]

Uh...

Run!

[Velociprey crying]


[Nox yelps]

Aiden, no!

[tense instrumental music playing]

[Velociprey roars]

[Aiden screams]

Come on!

Climb up here!

That was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

It can't get any worse than that.

Aiden, come up here.

[Aiden grunts] What's that smell?


Ugh. [groans]

Oh!

I was incorrect. It's...

Uh, yeah, it's worse.
[thunder rumbles]



That is what you face.

An Elder Dragon.

An unbridled force of nature given flesh,

headed directly for your village.

[dramatic orchestral music playing]

[Aiden gasps]

Aiden, you have, at most, three days
until your village is destroyed.

[Lunastra growling]

[fire crackling]

[flames roaring]

That's an Elder Dragon?

I've tracked it for almost a month.
Your people must leave the valley at once.

We'll never make it.
The only way out is through the Everwood.

We'd run right into it.
Then you must go west.

The Western Ridge is unpassable.

It would take two weeks
to get out of the Elder Dragon's path.

What about the Guild?
They're too far away.

You said so yourself.

Aiden, you've seen the danger.

Convince your people to go west,
and you may still save some of them.

Remain in the valley,
and you will lose everyone.

Wait, where are you going?

It is my mission to warn every village
from here to the ocean to evacuate.

Not just yours.

So, that's it?

You're just gonna walk away?

Well, what if we fight it?

What if we can somehow change its course
so it doesn't destroy all those villages?

We're Hunters.

We have to do something!

An Elder Dragon
is not just another monster.

And you are not a Hunter.

Maybe not. Maybe I've been kidding myself,

but at least I know
what it means to be a monster Hunter.

I'm not gonna turn my back
on Elder Daazel, Burl,

Genovan, Mitul, orÂ Ebbi.

I'll fight with sticks if I have to!


and he becomes
even more determined to stay.

"Care for nature,
and it will deliver prosperity."

"Build from prosperity
to craft a thriving community."

"Live harmoniously in that community

and teach it to always care for nature."

The cycle of balance?

Isn't that what you swore to protect?

That Elder Dragon is destroying nature,
and it's about to destroy community.

If you leave,
you're not just abandoning us.

You're turning your back on
what it means to be a Hunter.

Where did you learn that?

This journal belongs to a Hunter.

[shot echoes]

[bright orchestral music playing]

Anyone within range will find us.

If we're going to do this,
we're going to need some help.

Yes! It is "Alatre-on"!

The last entry here is only two days old.

Where did you get it?
I found it in Nox's loot.

[branches snap]
[Nox yelps, groans]

Who did you steal this from?

"Purr-cured" it, please.

Easy on the s-word.

Uh, the thing is, uh,
my memory's a little foggy, so...

Find the owner, and you go free.
[clicks tongue] Right this way.

[thunder crashes]

[birds calling]

to where I found the Hunter.

She was camped here for the night.

You guys smell that?

This way. And careful.

The creature
she's hunting is extremely dangerous.

Buddy, if we run into trouble,
plan A is run away.

Plans C, D, and E are hide,

negotiate, and run away.

There is no plan boomerang.

[screams]
[grunts] Get out of the way!

[Julius grunts]
[Nerscylla growls]

[jaws clanging]

[Julius grunts]
[Nerscylla growls]


Hey, ugly! Over here.
[Kinsect buzzes]


[Nerscylla growls]

[Hunter grunts]

You're a lot faster than that last one.

[yelps, grunts]

This is high.

[straining, grunts]

Paisley!



We are here to he... [groans]

Ugh. Amateurs.

[Aiden screaming]

Ah! Oh! [grunts]

[Nox] They're not coming this way.
[screams]


[in slow-motion] Oh no!

Can't believe I'm doing this.


[grunts, screams]

I got you, man. You're gonna be okay.

[Hunter grunts]

[Nox and Aiden screaming]
[Hunter] Seriously?

[Nox and Aiden yelp]

[Nox groans]
[Aiden screams]

Okay, big guy.
Let's see how well you fight.

Ha! You <i>are </i>a nasty one, aren't ya?
[Nerscylla growls]

[Hunter yelps, grunts]

[Julius grunts]
[Aiden] Julius!

[straining]
[Julius groans]




[yelps, groans]
[Aiden] Nox!

[Julius grunting]
[Aiden] Julius! Watch out!

[Julius panting]
[Nerscylla hisses]


[Julius groans]
[Aiden] Oh!

[Julius grunts]

[Aiden] Hey! I'm still up here!
Time for plan boomerang.

No, no, no! No plan boomerang!

Hyah!

[Aiden screams]

[Nox yelps, grunts]

Sure, he gives me the weapon
that comes flying back at your face.

[Julius grunts]

[dramatic orchestral music playing]

[Nerscylla growls]
[Julius groans]

Give him a big kiss for us.

[Julius grunts]
[Nerscylla screeches]

[Aiden] No. Shoo. Go away. No.
[Paisley buzzing]

[Aiden screams, groans]

[Hunter and Julius grunting]

I'm back in this.

I'm gonna flank him! [grunts]

[Hunter yelps]

I got a little problem here!

stuck in the gooey stuff.

hurry, hurry. He's coming.

He's gonna eat me. Hurry!

Watch out!

[Nerscylla growls]

[entrails splatter]
[Aiden] Ugh!


was so cool!

That was so cool! Did you see?

Guys,
I can't hold this little fella all day.

Oh man. I was up in the tree,
and then I swung back. I...

I got a few hits in, and then...

Thanks a bunch, you guys.
I only needed another few minutes

to ascertain
its bite strength and leaping ability.

And those swords,
they're gonna throw the data way off.

[Julius] You slayed it.
Your partner was in big trouble.

And he's lucky this was a juvenile.

I would expect an Ace Hunter to recognize
when someone doesn't need help.

Ace Hunter?

[Julius grunts]
Yeah, him.

You, not so much.
Hey.

Nice work, geniuses. [sighs]

Of course, nobody else takes the time to...

...obtain proper monster data.

Just leave it to Mae
to do all the legwork,

then mess it up
when she's almost done. [sighs]

Here I was, thinking I was the only one
following up on these reports.

No? Uh, why are you even here then?

You're Mae, I'm guessing.
Oh! My journal. Oh! My notes.

Oh! [kisses] Oh my gosh.

I thought I'd lost you.
[chuckles] We found it.

Uh, I mean,
well, we found Nox, and he sto...

Hey, so, uh,
should we be concerned about that?

[man screaming, muffled]

I'm up here!
[shot rings out]

[man groans]
[Mae] Whoa.

[man grunting]

Took me a while to pick up your trail
after I saw the flare.

Sorry I missed the party.

Nadia.
Julius.

Two Ace Hunters.

Today must be my lucky day or something.
You two know each other?

They assigned me the region
just south of here.

I spotted the smoke on the horizon.

It's headed right into this valley.

It's a Lunastra, a big one.

You've seen it?
Lunastra?

As in, an Elder Dragon Lunastra?
[Julius groans] Uh... Ah...

And you got close to it?
What kind of a wingspan did it have?

Was its mane more cobalt blue
or closer to periwinkle?


Seems like you guys
had this one under control. Wait.

No. You're actually going to fight it?

We could use your help.
Are you kidding?

No one's done a comprehensive assessment
of a Lunastra before.

You know what we're asking.

with the Ludroth is any indication,

you do a lot better
with me watching your back.

"Gargw-awesome."

What the...?
Uh, he does that.

Hey, uh, I... I don't think
that guy can breathe in there.

[binding rips]
[man panting]

Where... Where is that thing?

Did... Did you kill it?

Oh, thank you. You saved my life.

That thing destroyed my whole caravan.

You really want
to take on an Elder Dragon,

we're gonna need
a lot more than armor repairs.

We're gonna need weapons.

Big weapons.

Uh, actually, I was trading
with a smithy not far from here.

Name of Ravi.

I can show you where to find him,

but I should warn you,
he is not very fond of visitors.

[tools clanging]
[Nox laughs] What? Oh yeah.

I'm sure
this guy gets lots of customers every day.

Yeah.

[bright orchestral music playing]
Uh, excuse me.

Whatever your business, take it elsewhere.

Uh, please.
There's an Elder Dragon coming.

We're trying to stop it.
[steam hisses]

We need some...

If you'd just forge some equipment for us,
it can make a big difference.

I don't forge weapons.

You'll die too!

This Elder Dragon
you're so eager to confront,

its life can't be measured

by human understanding.

It has existed for ages

and will continue to exist
long after we're gone.

Compared to that,
our lives are small, meaningless things.

Maybe your life
has been meaningless, but mine won't be.

Aiden, go.


Did you forget
how dangerous an Elder Dragon is?

You're walking to your own death,
and you're taking this boy with you.

He's not doing it for himself,
and neither are we.

Or did you forget
what it means to be a Hunter?

You were one, weren't you?

Not... for a long time.

[theme music playing]

[Gargwa clucking]

Oh. What's this?

There's been a change of plans, everyone.
We're not leaving.

We're gonna stay and defend our homes.

And I've brought us some help.
Wait, what?

[villagers clamoring]

just outside the village.

<i>If we can guide it right into that spot,
we can set a trap for it.</i>

[villagers grunting]

It's a one-of-a-kind Nerscylla stinger.

All kinds of uses.

Sewing, walking stick... Ow!
[stinger pierces]

...tranquilizer.

Oh...

[bird cries in distance]

[Ebbi] And this?
I scouted as far as I could get.

[Mae] She's a tough one.
Tracks all over.

Everything for 100 miles

has been stirred up
by the Lunastra's migration.

It may work to our advantage.

There are some things we need
that we can only get from monsters.

[Aiden grunts]

Ah.

[Bowgun cocks]

Uh... [grunts]

Oh brother.

[monster growls]
[Nadia] Here it comes!

[yelps] Where are you guys?
[Aiden] Nox! Nox! Nox!

What are you doin' over there?

[Nox screaming]

Nadia, now.


[Nox grunts, yelps]


Gotcha, buddy.
[Congalala groans]

Nice shot.

Mae, we're up.

[tense orchestral music playing]

[Julius and Mae grunting]

[Congalala roars]
[Julius groans]

[Mae grunts]

[Congalala snarls]

Julius! Look out! Yellow Mushroom!

[explosion echoes]



[Congalala roars]

[Mae and Julius grunt]

[Congalala cries]



[Congalala inhales]
[Aiden grunts]

[Congalala belches]
[Julius grunts] Look out.

Whoa!
Yellow Mushrooms cause paralysis.

Set the trap.


[Mae yells, groans]

[Aiden straining]

Now!
[Aiden grunts]

Yes!


[Nadia sighs] Just like you drew it up.

That's what teamwork looks like.

Nice deployment on that trap, Aiden.

Thanks. I didn't even need
those extra anchors you gave me.

You didn't anchor it?
[groans] Come on.

[fabric ripping]
[Congalala growling]

Julius, it smells something coming.

[birds calling]

Everyone, retreat.

No! We can't just let him get away.

Aiden, now's not the time.

Julius, let me fix this.

[ropes snap]
[Aiden screams, yelps]


Nox, get that Yellow Mushroom!
What?

Are you crazy?

We can use it to paralyze the Congalala.

[Nox yelps]

Uh... Ah! Oh! Hyah!

Aiden, disengage!

[Aiden grunting]


[Nox chuckles]

Oh sh...


Nox! You good, buddy?

Whoa!
[Mae grunts]


[Congalala farts]
[Mae] Ugh. Oh.

[coughs] Oh...
[electricity crackles]

Oh no.


[monster 1 growls]

That can't be good.Â Julius!

Oh no.

[monster 1 growls]
[monster 2 yelps]

[branches rustling]
[monster 1 snorts]

[suspenseful orchestral music playing]


[Deviljho roars]
[Aiden] Whoa!

[Congalala growls]
[Deviljho roars]


[Congalala roars]


[Paisley buzzing]
[Mae chuckles]

[Deviljho growls]

There's a big monster in front of me.

[Congalala groans]

[Julius grunting]

[yells, grunting]


[Deviljho roars]

[Julius groans]

[Nox coughs weakly]

[Julius groans]

[Deviljho roars]


[Deviljho cries]

[Aiden grunts]

Gotcha. [straining]


Since when did pickles grow teeth?

Freaking Deviljho!
[slurring] Deviljho?

Hey, that's got a Dragon Element.

We could totally use that
for the Dragonator.

[Bowgun fires]
[Deviljho cries]

[roars]
[Aiden] Whoa!

[Nadia panting]

[groans, laughs] It is on, dragon breath!

[Bowgun fires]
[Julius grunts]

[Deviljho screeches]
[Julius grunting]

[yells]
[Deviljho cries]

[Julius grunts]

[yells, groans]

[Aiden] No!
Deviljho?

That's a Deviljho!
Yeah. Welcome back to reality.

Julius.
Go!

[Deviljho growls]



Mae, we can use the mushroom
to paralyze theÂ Jho.

Got it.


[Deviljho growls]
[Mae yelps, grunts]

[coughing]
[Nox] Ah...

[Mae groans]

[Julius] Get out of here!
[groans] We're a team!

[Mae groaning]

Paisley, go!

[Paisley buzzing]


[Deviljho roars]
[Aiden] Watch out!


[electricity crackling]

[Julius groans, grunts]


[Deviljho growls]
[Julius gasps]

[yelling and grunting]


[Julius grunts]
[Deviljho roars]

[Julius yells]

[grunts]
Watch out!

[Nox yelps]
[Julius grunting]

[Deviljho cries]

[Aiden exclaims] Whoa! Yes!
[heroic orchestral music playing]

Everyone all right?

Whoo! Did you see that?
Did you see what we just did?

Are you kidding me?

I pulled off
that sweet block you showed me.

Your recklessness
almost got us all killed.

We would've been safe
when thatÂ Deviljho appeared

if you had just listened to me.

When I command you to retreat, you do so.

No hesitation!

I was wrong about you.

For all of your talk
of protecting your village,

the only thing that you care about
is getting your pat on the back.


No, Nadia. I know what I'm seeing.

This is not a team that I can lead.
This was always a fool's errand anyway.

Tell everyone to pack up.

[flies buzzing]

Do you think being slightly chewed
is gonna hurt the market value?

Now look at things.

Hey, it's not your fault.

No, I messed up again,

just like getting myself cornered
by thatÂ Velocidrome.


And blowing theÂ Congalala trap.

Oh, and don't forget,

almost getting us trampled,
fried, and devoured by aÂ Deviljho.

No big deal.

I'm startin' to think
I'm not cut out to be a Hunter.

And following the fake tracks I made.

Yeah, don't forget that one.

Yeah. I'm sorry for that day.

For trying to hit you
with a hammer, I mean.

I'm glad I missed.


[villagers clamoring]

[Burl] Oh, Aiden!
[man 1] It's Aiden!

[Burl] Everyone all right?
[Nox] Thank you, thank you.

Heroes, coming through.

The heroes have returned.
[man 2] Hey, Aiden!


Boy, are we hungry.

[birds singing]
[villagers continue chattering]

[gentle orchestral music playing]

Do you remember our first hunt?

Gypceros, wasn't it?

It was the first time
you hunted with a Gunner.

You spent half the fight
looking over your shoulder,

trying to make sure
you weren't in the way.

So, when the thing flashed its crystal
to blind us...

Ah, I saw spots for weeks.

for Master Kambei's prodigal student.

Why did you follow me, Nadia?

Aiden made a mistake. He's young.

His impulsiveness is a problem.

Says the guy who once charged
into aÂ Rajang's mating grounds unarmed.

That's exactly what worries me.

Says the guy who risked his friend...

his mentor's life.

That was not your fault.

We had enough on our hands
with the Rathian.

Having aÂ Kushala Daora
appear right in the middle of it

was a one-in-a-million chance.

Nah, it wasn't that.

I made mistakes.
The master had to come in and save me.

We were fighting an Elder Dragon.

I did it to impress the master.


You were Master Kambei's favorite.

He saw something important in you.

I saw itÂ too, with the Deviljho.

We can't do this without you.

I'm not that person anymore.
[Nadia] You are.

That's why I followed you.

[river flowing]

Take my weapons.

Just, please stay and lead the others.

Protect Timben.

I acted like a fool.

The people here counted on me,
and I let them down.

I know you won't lead a team
with me on it.

We will protect Timben...

together.


You said you needed a smith?

[upbeat orchestral music playing]
[Ravi and Burl grunting]


Congalala stomach should work fine
for the steam housing.

Deviljho bones for the bow.

Never forged anything like this.
Can't promise it'll work.

If you're all finished, the village
has prepared something special.

You must eat.

[Nox munching]

What?

[villagers chattering]
[calming instrumental music playing]

To Timben's protectors.

Good hunting!
[Nox] Enough, already. Let's eat.

That journal of yours is something.

I think I learned more flipping through it

than the rest
of my time trying to be a Hunter.

When I was about Ebbi's age,
my parents made me write down everything.

Needleberries, Flashbugs.

They were researchers.
Sticklers for accurate notes.

I hated it.

So, I got my Guild license

and accepted a quest
that would send me out into the world.

Gone for two full years.

Figures.

I'm about to see an Elder Dragon,
and suddenly, I'd give just about anything

to be back sketching bugs
and berries with them all over again.

"Zamite" be something wrong with you.


Make puns out of monster names.

The village I used to live in
was destroyed when I was seven,

overrun by monsters.

[gentle music playing]
I lost my parents.

I spent a long time
after that being scared.

Eventually...

I just got tired of it.

I figured, if I learned about monsters
and made jokes out of their names,

they didn't seem as scary.

Hmm. I'd say, "Veloci-diculous."

[both laugh]

When I was inÂ Val Habar some years ago,

I remember rumors of a rogue Hunter.

They say he turned his back
on the Guild's philosophy.

Started hunting for sport,

taking trophies,
and selling weapons to fund his habit.

You came to me.

If you have something
you want to say to me, say it.

A Hunter
can easily lose his way in battle.

Especially alone. When we go out there...

I don't need a sermon
from a Hunter willing to risk <i>our </i>lives

to redeem <i>himself </i>from past mistakes.

Past mistakes
have a remarkable way of taking us down.

Well, maybe tomorrow will be a chance

for all of us to exorcise
some very old monsters.

[woman] Watch out!
[monster roars]

[villagers screaming]

[Mae gasps]
[Nadia] Move it.

Come on. I'm not finished eating.

[Nadia] Everything's ready.
Time to kick some Lun-<i>as</i>- tra.

Really?
[laughs] I actually liked that one.

Not the time.

[fire crackles]

[Lunastra growling]

[dramatic orchestral music playing]

Weapons out.

Whoa. She's huge.

[Nadia] Cover your ears!
[Lunastra roars]

[Aiden yells]

[Nox] I'm out.
Nadia.

See if you can draw it off.
Got it.


She's not going for it.


Nox, go.

[Lunastra growling]
Hurry.


[Lunastra snarls]

Oh! That's a lot of rocks.
How did that not work?

the valley unless we make it.

[Aiden] And now it flies?
It'll burn the village down from the air.

Ground it!
[Nadia] Coming in!

[Bowgun shots echoing]



No!

My brand-new shield!

[screams]
[Lunastra growling]


Come on!
Look at this thing. It took me six hours.

Forget about it! It was terrible anyway.

[Mae] Ooh!
[Lunastra snarls]

[Mae grunts]
You're a lot stronger than I imagined.

[Ravi sighs, grunting]

[Lunastra growling]

[Ravi] Come on!
[blade clangs]

[Ravi groans]

We're going to draw it into position.

Aiden, showtime.

[Aiden panting]

Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.

Don't mess it up.Â Don't mess it up.

[Dragonator clanking]
[electricity crackling]

[Lunastra roars]

It's time for plan Dragonator!

[Julius grunts]

[Lunastra snarls]

It knows!

The jig is up!
Hit it!

[Lunastra roars]

[Nox screams]

[Aiden yells]

[Ravi] It didn't work!
The fire damaged it.

Use the snare traps. Hold it in position.

[ropes straining]

[Lunastra growling]

The firing mechanism is busted!

let it pressurize.

Then you'll have
to trigger theÂ Dragonator manually.



We can't hold this all day.

[Aiden straining] Almost have it.

[Mae grunts]

[electricity crackling]
[Lunastra roars]

[Julius yells]

[groans]
[Lunastra growls]

[Bowgun fires]

You're welcome!

[ropes straining]
[Ravi groans] I'm losing it.

[Aiden grunts]

Got it!

[Lunastra roars]
[Julius grunting]


[Lunastra roars]



[Mae grunts]

[Lunastra snarls]

[Mae] Ravi, get out of there.
Get it from this end.

It's jammed. Hold on!

[Lunastra growling]
[Ravi grunting]

Do it!
Ravi, no!

[Ravi screams]
[Lunastra roars]

No! [gasps]
[Dragonator creaks]


[electricity crackles]

[Lunastra bellows]


[heroic music playing]

[man 1] They did it!

They slayed the Lunastra!
[man 2] I knew they could!

[man 3] Yes!
[Burl] Everyone, put out the fires.

[Julius panting]


[Mae grunts]

[Aiden straining]

[group panting]


Everyone okay?

Ravi's dead.
[Mae] Oh.


[Lunastra growls]

Oh no.
[Lunastra snarls]

That's not good.

[Lunastra panting]

We had one shot with the Dragonator.
What do we do now?

There's nothing left to do but attack.

Give it everything we've got.

It cannot reach the village.

Here. Fight with this.

[Julius] Hmm.
[Aiden] Wait.

Dual Blades. They work separately,

but always together.

[Nadia] Hey, what the...?
Aiden, what are you doing?

I have a plan.

Julius, you have to trust me. I need time.

You'll have it. What are you going to do?

Restore balance.

[Lunastra growling weakly]

Did Aiden just run away
with all of my ammunition?

Uh, yeah. He says he needs some time.

No problem. Ideas how to do that?

[woman] Watch out!
[Aiden] Nox!

Get everyone out of the village!

Oh man. It's time for plan panic.

[villagers screaming and clamoring]

Use the buildings for cover.

Julius, the villagers.

Go to them.

I'm out. [grunts]
[Bowgun clicks]

[Nadia yells]

[Lunastra growls]

[Julius grunting]

[Julius groans]

Please work.Â Please work.
Please work.Â Please work.

Please work.Â Please work. Please work.


[Paisley buzzing]

[Lunastra roars]

[woman] The fire's spreading.
[Burl] More buckets!

[woman] Hurry. We gotta get outta here.
I'm not leaving.

You have to get out of here. Now.
Here.

Oh no, Ebbi. You have to go.
[Ebbi] But I... I'm helping.

[Lunastra growls]

[Paisley buzzes weakly]

[gentle instrumental music playing]

[Mae gasps]

Paisley.

[Paisley buzzes weakly, crackles]

Here we go.

[Lunastra growling]


No! Stop!
[dramatic music resumes playing]

[Mae grunting]

[Lunastra roars]


[Lunastra snarls]
[Mae grunting]

[Mae yells]

[Lunastra growling]

[Mae panting]

[Lunastra roars]
[Ebbi] Mae!

Mae.
[Nadia] Oh no.

[Lunastra snarls]
[Julius] No!


[Lunastra growling]

It'll ignite the whole village.

Go! Go! Run!


[Lunastra growls, roars]

[explosion blasts]
[Nadia screams]


[Burl] The Gargwa coops!
[villagers screaming]

[Aiden groans] Son of a...

[Nadia groans]
[Julius coughing]

[Nadia grunts]

[Julius groans, panting]

[Lunastra growling]
[dramatic orchestral music swells]


[both panting]

Spark. Spark.Â Spark.
Spark.Â Spark.Â Spark.

Yes!

[Lunastra continues growling]

[explosion blasts]

[Aiden grunts]

Oh! [shouts]
[heroic orchestral music playing]

Ha-ha! Plan boomerang saves the day.

What was Aiden's idea again?

Go!

[villagers shouting]
[Nadia grunting]

[Lunastra roars]
[Nadia groans]

[Julius grunts]

Watch out!

[shouts]
[Lunastra snarls]


[Julius sighs]


[birds singing]
[gentle orchestral music playing]

Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.

Because of you, the balance of nature

can be brought back to this village.

Thank you.

There is no blame.

It was their choice.

They followed you
into an unwinnable battle.

To treat it as anything less
would diminish what they gave. And why.

No. It wasn't me they followed.

They followed something larger,
a balance each of us hope to find.

[Nox sniffles]
Here. This is Mae's journal.

You keep it. It has instructions
to make thatÂ Rathalos antidote in it.

I made my own journal
to start my own path...

just like Mae.

Timben will be in good hands
with you here to protect it.

[soaring orchestral music playing]

Hold up! Wait! [panting]


Dundorma.

The Guild will need to know
what happened here.

I want to come with you.

There's a bigger picture out there,
beyond me, beyond Timben.

You taught me that
the night we first saw the Lunastra.

There are bigger threats out there.

If I'm gonna face them,
I need to become an Ace Hunter.


That's a good "hmm."
I've known him a long time.

And if I am translating correctly,
that means,

[imitating Julius] "Why, Aiden,
you've come such a long way."

"I would be thrilled
to take you on as my cadet."

[Julius grunts]
[Aiden] That's "ama-Zinogre"!

[Julius groans]

Right, Nadia?


[crew members chattering]

That was pretty fantastic.

Yeah, like that story
about you taking on the Zamtrios.

Hey, that really happened, okay?
I came under it. I swept, all right?

This wasn't one of <i>those </i>stories,

was it?

Read this.

[theme music playing]

Wow. It's Mae's last entry to her parents.

<i>I have enjoyed every moment of my journey.</i>

<i>Father and Mother,
you have taught me well.</i>

<i>I think I understand now
why this world needs a Guild</i>

<i>and people like you
to teach them how to live in harmony.</i>

<i>Tonight, I joined a team of Hunters.</i>

<i>The mission
we are going on is truly dangerous.</i>

<i>I fear it may be my last,</i>

<i>but interestingly, I'm not afraid.</i>

<i>For these Hunters I fight with
are intelligent, caring, courageous,</i>

<i>and they brighten my world.</i>

<i>My heart is filled with hope.</i>
