[gun firing]

[bow shooting]

[bow shooting]

[soft dramatic music]



[hard breathing]

[wind howling]

[soft dramatic music]

[Josh exhaling]

[hard breathing]

Dad?


No, son, stop [screams]!



Run, run!



[punches striking]

[hard breathing]

Josh, it's me,
it's me, please.

It's me, it's me, okay, it's me.

The heat, the fire,
is how they hunt.

It's how they'll find
us. You need to think.

Do you understand me?

Do you?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, you okay?

You're okay, you're okay.

Come on, let's get
you out of this.

Let's get this off you.

Come on, we'll get it off you.

Every second counts
now, all right?

You need to breathe,
you need to focus

and you need to concentrate.

Do you understand?

Do you understand?

Okay, there you
are, take my coat.

Take my coat.

Take my coat.

Yeah, there you go.

How's that?

How's that?

How's that?

Okay.

Let's go home, okay.

Let's go home.

[snow crunching]

What's wrong?

Come on, let's go, let's go.

[soft dramatic music]

Let's move, all right?
We're almost home.

Let's go, come on, come on.

[dramatic music]

Son of a bitch, let's
go. Come on, Josh.

[dramatic music]

Come on, let's go, let's go.

[dramatic music]

Come on.

Dad.

Get over here.

Get over here, get over here.

All right, look, look
at me. Look at me.

All right, stay close.

Okay.
Okay?

I need you to
stay close to me.

You ready?
Yes.

Go.

Come on.

[dramatic music]

[soft mysterious music]

Come inside.

[hard breathing]

[wind whistling]

Oh, fuck.

[hard breathing]

[wind whistling]

Sh.

Wait.

Wait.

[wind whistling]

[soft dramatic music]


Dad, Mia.

Oh no, don't look.

Mom?
Don't look, don't look.

Don't look, okay?

I need you to be strong.

I need you to check
on your sister, okay?

I need you to be
strong, for all of us.

All right?

Hide now.

Hide, okay?

[soft dramatic music]

[footsteps ascending]

[monitor beeping]



[dramatic music]

No, please, my children.

[hard breathing]

Joe.

[hard breathing]

Mia?

[soft piano music]

[monitor beeping]

[generator cranking]

I heard them, out in the barn.

When I checked this one,
the other one got in.

I had to.

How bad is it?

Gas, food, meds.

Anything they could grab.

But that was our stuff.

Ethan, we can't stay.

Are you hurt?

[soft piano music]

Keep shining, beautiful.

Did you hear me?

I'm fine.

I'm just a little shook up.

Why don't you let me
take you downstairs?

I told you, I'm fine.

Dad!

No no, no no, stay there.

Ethan. Ethan.

Ethan, open your eyes.

Ethan, if you can hear
me, please open your eyes.

Josh, grab my flashlight please.

Ethan, look at me.

[monitor beeping]

Okay, don't do this.

Thank you.

Don't do this, damn you.

Ethan, Ethan.

Ethan!

[monitor beeping rapidly]

Dad, wake up.

Wake up.

[hard breathing]

Wake up. Dad, wake up.

Mom, he's not waking up.

I know, honey, hang on.

Come on.

Wake up, come on.

Come on, baby.


Josh, he needs water.

Come on, baby girl.

I want you to take
this rag right here,

put some water on it, and
squeeze it into his mouth.

Okay, now that's
it, now that's it.

I'm right here.

I'm right here.

[monitor beeping]

That's it.

I'm right here.

[hard breathing]

Back away.

[soft dramatic music]

Why don't you go downstairs?
I'll meet you there.

[monitor beeping]


[wind howling]

[monitor beeping faintly]

[Josh imitating gunshot]


[hard breathing]

Sorry.

I know it's not a toy.

I was just practicing.

Focus, don't hesitate.

Did you sleep good?

Where's your mom?

Garbage duty.

I tried to help, but she
told me to wait here.

You found me down here
all by yourself, huh?

Yep.

Nice try.

I wanted you to be here,

so when you woke up,
you wouldn't be afraid.

What I tell you
about being afraid?

That it's not real.

Give me that.

Sit down.

It's very real, son, fear.

I've seen it.

It kills dreams. It kills hope.

And there's no running
from it. There's no hiding.

It's always going to be there.

But you always have a choice.

It's how you use that
fear that matters.

Don't let it control you.

If you do, it'll take
over, paralyzing you.

You never look scared.

I hide it better than most.

Why?

Because I need to be strong.

To lift up stuff?

Close.

[wind howling]



I'm always scared.

[soft piano music]

Come here, son.

Wait.

No, it's okay, it's okay.

All right.

You feel that?

Yes.

This is where you are.

Dad, that's your heart.

I know, I know, listen.

You hear it?

This is where everyone is.


Mm-hm.

Even Mia?

Of course.

And Mom too?

Yes.

And this is where we are.

So you see, whenever you're
afraid or alone or scared,

you never really are.

We're always right with you.

[soft piano music]

Always?

Always.

[balls striking]

Ooh, so close.

The night's young,
Mary. The night is young.

In other news,
the Halifax Energy

Processing Plant opened today.

However, the surrounding mountain
communities are concerned

with the toxic waste generated
and its environmental impact

on the area's water supply.

A statement from Halifax's
Chairman Kevin Roberts reads

in part, We're creating
opportunity...

[instrumental country music]

Ooh, what happened?

What happened, distracted?

Hardly.

I'm gonna need more than
this if I'm to entertain

Grizzly Addams' approach
here in a second.

Oh yeah, he looks
like a hugger.

Uh-huh.

Hey, do you think they
make those vodka tonics?

Did they have it the
last time you asked?


Fine.

[instrumental country music]

Hey, uh, excuse you.

Uh, look, asshole.

Are you done?

Are you?

As I recall, I placed this
exact quarter, right here,

reserving my spot to play next.

How do you know
that one's yours?

Lucky sevens.

Wow, okay.

Look, guy.

Ethan.

Ethan, my friend
and I are here

just trying to have some fun.

I'll prove that it's lucky.

How are you gonna do that?

Well, if I can guess
your name in three tr...

One try.

Mm-hm.

You have to go out with me.

What do I get if you're wrong?

That's a lotta faith in a
shiny, tiny little thing.

Well I'll have you
know we've been known

to think very highly
of tiny things.

What do you say?

Mm, okay.

All right, I'll be
needing this, and that hand.

Uh.

Sh.

No, that's not it.

Hm.

Josephine.

You [laughs].

So why don't you go
ahead and put your number

on this and be
expecting my call?

Mm-hm.

How'd you know?

You have a tab open,
and I know the bartender.

See you soon, Joe.

Speaking of charming.

You shut up.

Oh my God.

So, how'd I do?

Very smooth actually.

Mm, kinda.

Kinda? Get over here,
what are you talking about?

That's some of my best
stuff, and the quarter bit,

gotta admit that was genius.

You two still play
this game from college.

You guys are gross.

It's good to
see you too, Mary.

Here, take that for me.

Please, because I gotta, come
on, Rico Suave, let's go.

Okay, I see how it is.

Wow.

Mm.

[soft music]

Charming.

Mm.
Oh.

Careful.

What?

That's how we got two.

I told you I'm feeling lucky.

You hear anything back
from the hospital?

No, no, I don't know if
they're still interviewing or

they made a decision or cut
the position, I don't know.

I just hate waiting.

I don't what we're
gonna do, Ethan.

It'll be fine.

We're gonna be fine.

We're all behind you, baby.

Besides, I can hop
on one of those crews

they're putting
together up north.

Yeah, but it's so far out,

and then you're gone
a few days a week.

I can catch up on all those
books on tape you got me.

You haven't even started them.

Honey, my life
is a page-turner.

You are ridiculous.

I know.

[soft piano music]

[patrons chattering]

[soft piano music]

[soft dramatic music]

[wind howling]


Let me help.

How you feeling?

Alive.

[wind howling]

[Ethan grunting]

In the corner.


They got it all.

[soft dramatic music]

Every fucking drop.

[soft dramatic music]

Took it off you when
you blacked out.

Good idea.

How many rounds left?

Not enough. Rifle?

Same.

[soft dramatic music]

I can pull what's left in
the truck's tank for Mia.

I'll melt some dust. We'll
have some fresh water.

A fire?

We'll control it.

We'll keep it small and hidden.

[door creaking]

[hard breathing]

[soft dramatic music]

Ethan?

I can go on a run tonight,

and I can start to
replenish what we lost.

That should give us
at least a few days

to figure things out.

We just gotta hold
out a little longer.

We don't have a few days.

And if we siphon what's left
in the truck, then I...

Nobody's coming, Ethan.

They've given up.

What are you doing?

Pulling what's in
that tank for her.

We've already searched
and siphoned everything

within a 25-mile radius.

Then I'll go out further.

What, further like that?

How much more are
you willing to lose?

Ethan, there's a full
tank in the truck.

There's half in our generator.

It'll give us a few
days to relocate.

Where?

The border.

You know what they're
doing to people there,

and now with, Mia...

But once they see
what's happened.

They know what's happened.

Okay, well, where
are they, Ethan?

They told us to wait.

But where are they, Ethan?

They said they'd be here.

Ethan, where are
they are? You said...

I don't know, Joe!

I don't know, Joe.

[wind howling]


[wind howling]

[hard breathing]

[footsteps approaching]

[hard breathing]

They said they'd come for us.

Protect us.

[wind howling]

You were supposed
to protect us.

[soft dramatic music]

Do you remember the odds?

Curing the infection is a
case-by-case basis, Ethan.

50-50, half.

Cure or kill, I remember.

I'm not giving up, Joe.

Do you trust me?

Do you?

[soft dramatic music]


I can't anymore.

[soft piano music]

Can you do this?

[wind howling]

Hm?


Oh God.

I heard yelling,
and I thought...

It's okay, we were
were just talking.

All right, we were just talking.

It's okay, honey.
Come here, come here.

Are you, um, are you hungry?

Well, I ate some beans.

And some peaches.

Sorry.

And we're almost outta water.

We should go on a run tonight.

Dad, I can sneak in anywhere.

No, no no, no no,
no more sneaking.

Please?

Come on.


Of course, fine.

I'll get my pack.

Okay.

Okay, Ethan.

[gun firing]

Ow!


Josh! Get in the house!

[soft dramatic music]

Come on, come on.

Come on.

Oh my God, that hurts.

Come on, come on.

Come on.

[gun firing twice]

[gun firing]


Come only, over here.

Mom, Dad!

Get inside!

Is she okay?

Shut up, okay.


No get him up, get him up.

[guns firing]

It's okay.

[Ethan coughing]

Ethan, look at me.

Show me your eyes.

Show me your eyes!

[gun firing]

I'm so sorry, Ethan.

[guns firing]

That's it.

[dramatic music]

[chamber spinning]

Anything?

No.

You?

They're low.
They're holding out.

They're out.

Be my guest.

Go left.

And get him outta that thing.

You're with me.

And what are we gonna do?

Going right through
the front door.

[soft dramatic music]

[wind howling]

[hard breathing]

[soft dramatic music]

Son of a bitch.

[guns firing]

Careful.

Let him go, boy.

Lotta friction you're making.

I ain't gonna tell
you again. You drop him!

Careful now, before
hell comes calling.

Times like these, we need
to rely on one another.

Oh, I see.

Well that's not very
neighborly of you.

[soft dramatic music]

[hard breathing]

Say, what did you do
to that little one?

[soft dramatic music]

[guns firing]

[monitor beeping]

[gun firing]

[dramatic music]


[dramatic music]

[gun striking]

Grab the cords.


Playing possum, huh?

I love it. I fucking love it.


[wind howling]

Hi ya, Sonny.

Josh?

Josh?

Come here.

Come here, come here.
How's everything.

It's good.

It's good? Everything okay?

Okay, I want you to wait
up there, all right?

Okay.

I want you to wait up there.

Wait upstairs.

Go on, go on.

[wind howling]



Let me see, let me see.


We need to close this.

They hit the kit.

There's no needle or
thread. Everything's gone.

Okay, okay, we
cauterize it then.

All right, we can
stop the bleeding.

No no no, that's
just gonna increase

my chance of infection.

Okay.

What a shame.

Even comfort from the
cold's been taken from us.

Insulation, smart.

[lighter clicking]

Tell me, how do you
think we'll fare

through the thick of winter?

Without fire.

What with these
sickos running around,

hunting off the heat.

[lighter clicking]

Don't.

[lighter clicking]

I'll give you a choice.

Finish us off with
that scattergun,

make a fire, tiny one, though.

Don't wanna excite the natives.

But that'll just postpone
your woman's demise.

She needs meds.

Ironically, it would
seem, I too am in need

of the healing powers you
both so desperately seek.

And wouldn't you just know it?

We happen to have a
fresh batch back at camp.

So what are you gonna do, boy?

How many more
of you are there?

You know crowds
ain't safe no more.

You're looking at what's left.

And him?

He's just being
punished, that's all.

Tough love.

Thanks to your woman's
handiwork here,

my brother and I
are a dying breed.

You give me that lighter,
I close both of you up.

Nah.

What?

That don't work for me.

Then I take it from
you and watch you suffer.


Today's just another day.

And like she said,

burning only opens us
up to all kindsa shit.

Besides [groans],
nothing vital's been hit.

How you holding up, darling?

you keep the heat.

Where's your camp?

It ain't far.

Draw me a map.

Ain't no map
gonna get you there.

We stay mobile.

What road then?

Hell, barely
any roads anymore.

Safe ones anyways.

What you need is someone
who knows the way.

If you think I'm
dragging your sorry ass...

ain't in no kinda shape

to be doing that.


But, I'm feeling kinda
charitable this evening.

So I will provide
you with a guide.

We're new around these parts,

and as a proper
welcoming gesture,

our little one-stop shop has
everything your hearts desire.

Where the fuck is it?

Do it.

I'll do it. I swear to God.

I know.

I can smell it on you.

You're gonna learn, boy.

Sooner or later.

In this new world of ours,

need is power.

Don't think I can't see you
sizing me up over there, sister.

[lighter clicking]

[soft dramatic music]

You motherfucker.


Ethan.

[soft dramatic music]

Fuck.

[soft dramatic music]


She's lying.

What other options do we have?

We leave, right now.

You'll die.

Brother?

Lincoln.

You have been nominated to
guide this man back to our camp

and provide him with any
medicine he so desires.

Upon your return and
administering to our wounds,

we will all go our happy ways.

How'd that be?

Be happy to.

raised him right.

Gas.


We want the gas you stole.

Stole [laughs]?

That's mighty white of you.

Accusing us of stealing.

Remind me how you came
about that anyway, huh?

We just want what's
ours, nothing more.

Everybody wants more.


[soft dramatic music]

[lighter clicking]

I'd say we have
ourselves an arrangement.

Look at that. We're sharing.


Thanks for being home, neighbor.

[lighter clicking]

[monitor beeping]

Now I'm freezing my ass off.

All right, keep up.

[soft piano music]

[monitor beeping]

[deep breathing]

[generator cranking]

[soft dramatic music]


For you, not much.

You guys playing roulette?

All cooped up in there
together like that.

They can sniff that
shit out real quick.

Both of them.

I don't blame you, though.

Good-looking lady like that.

Pretty head of golden hair, huh.

I'll bet you,

once upon a time you
guys find a quiet space,

she'd wrap her legs around you.

Make you feel like
a king, boy, shit.

Ain't nothing better than
that in the whole wide world.

Except maybe eating peaches.

Do you like peaches?

I love them. Love
me some peaches.

They're just so sweet

and so soft.

Your fingers, they
get all sticky

when you're holding
onto them, you know.

You gotta lick them
to clean them off.

Love me a sweet peach.

[soft dramatic music]

[birds chirping]

Dad's gonna teach me
how to shoot on this trip.


Nu-uh.
Uh-huh.

No, he's not.
Yes, he is.

Well I'm older, so.

So?

Hey, hey [laughs],
how about this?

How about we have Mom
show us how it's done?

Excuse me.

Yeah!
Yes.

Okay, what did I say?

They're not toys, we know.

They're not toys.

So you're gonna show us?

Come on, please.

Hey.

[shutter clicking]

All right, all right, all
right all right all right.

wait to use a gun.

You're giving him a
gun? He can't shoot.


[gun firing]



Thank you.

Ready?
Yeah.

Come on.

[gun clicking]

Got it?

Yeah.

Okay.

Like that.

Okay, just nice and steady.

You gotta breathe.

Mom.

Okay, yeah.

[deep breath]

[gun firing]


Nice shot, baby girl.

Thank you, thank you.
Very nice.

[soft music]

Your turn.

[soft piano music]

You said you wanted to try it.

Hey, you know,
I'm getting hungry.

Who's hungry? You hungry?

I'm hungry.

Yeah?

Oh, dead ass, tell me you brought
some of those little cheese things.

Mouth.

Sorry, but did you bring any?

bring any, did you?


Didn't bring any.

Mm.

We did.

Ah, ha ha, you're really lame.

Come here, come on.

Let's go, good job.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

What's up? You
hungry, little man, hm?

Yeah.

[soft piano music]

Okay, all right,
let's go. Let's go eat.

[dramatic music]

[gun firing]

You're too damn close.

Shut up.

[gun firing]

[gun clicking]

[soft dramatic music]

I ain't dying out here.


[wind howling]

You shouldn't have come here.

What?

You heard me.

Oh, I heard you.

What do you mean by that?

You and the pieces
of shit you came here

with shouldn't have come here.

We're just trying to
survive, like everyone else.

Moving from place to place.

Putting food in our bellies.

Trying to see another sunrise.

Are we really all that
different, you and me?


Yes.

No, we ain't.

How many homes you pick through?

Knowing whatever you
get, whatever you find,

might help you see another day.

How many mouths you robbed?

Tomorrows you and
your family took away.

We don't kill people.

Oh no?

Love the yard decorations.

They had to be put down.

You sound like them.

You come from the wall?

Fuck you. We
don't kill people.

You shot that girl.

We defend what's ours.

Amen, baby girl, as do we.

Invading homes with assault
rifles, you call that defense?

You don't carry when
you're ducking and dodging

the fucking lunatics
this mess unleashed,

or looking for that golden
goose they promised us?

What?

[Avery coughing]

Help him.

[Avery coughing]

You are so.

I wouldn't do that.



[soft dramatic music]



Who are you?

My name's Avery
Dennison. I'm a scout.

Scout my ass.

Quiet!

You from the wall?

We were assessing
zones two through four.

Assess is a fancy
word for targeting.

I won't say it again!

Go on.

We determined the reach and
severity of the infection.

Families within the perimeter
were supposed to be given

one countermeasure per
member of the household.

But that was before we,

we learned that containment
was no longer an option.

Over 95% of the area's
water supply was affected.

Anything that came
in contact with it,

wildlife, livestock, it was
all deemed nonessential.

And the countermeasure?

The vaccine?

Desiree here, and
the outsiders living

off the land were the
first to receive it.

When the pathogen mutated,

the company decided
on another option.

An evacuation?

Speak!

Once the countermeasure's
effectiveness

dropped to 50%, cure or
kill, people panicked,

bleeding into the countryside.

That's when zones were chosen.

We needed more time to
study the infection.

Snake oil, darling.

Carrots dangling to keep us
here while their wall went up.


You said zones are chosen.

Chosen for what?
And don't lie to me.

Measures needed to
cleanse the remaining

traces of the outbreak.

Then, mask it with an
event, a natural disaster.

Sell it to the public.

[soft dramatic music]

An accident.

We fight over scraps.
They pick up what's left.

Cover it up.

She's lying. My team
was never a party to...

How are they choosing them?

Choosing what?

The zones, where are
they starting from.

We were not told where.

Think. Where would you start?


That's not a place. Where?

South, south.

Bigger populations.

It's warmer. It
attracts the infected.

They're drawn to the heat.

The farther north you
go, into the cold,

everything's harder to track.

That's why you're here,
right, high heating?

Wrong.

[soft dramatic music]

Surviving.

[soft dramatic music]

We had friends there.
All those people.

Families, you're telling
me all that's gone?

Yes.

They hoped they could stop it.

Hope, that shit's dangerous.

But so are caged animals.

Especially ones that
have nothing to lose.

Humane options
were administered

in select communities
with higher headcounts.

[soft dramatic music]


End all of those lives.

Don't sell yourself
short, beautiful.

Sure you could.

Everybody just
needs a little push.


Stop it, let him go.


No one knows what
they're capable of

until they're at the edge.


Starving.

Dying.

Outta options.

[Avery groaning]

Changes you.

Changes everything.

Bullshit, let him go.

Everyone!

That's when it
comes outta hiding.

When your time comes,

wonder what you'll be.

Wolf? Sheep?

Either way,

packs always fight over scraps.

[Avery groaning]

Sometimes, flocks
need to be thinned.

[bones breaking]

[soft dramatic music]

[Ethan coughing]

Sh.

[Ethan coughing]

Quiet, shut the fuck up.

[gun firing twice]

[Ethan coughing]

[soft dramatic music]

[hard breathing]

[soft dramatic music]

Aw fuck.

[soft dramatic music]


[hard breathing]

[soft dramatic music]

Hey.


Oh, I bet that hurt like
a motherfucker, didn't it?

And there you go,
with that shit again.

I told you, man.


You keep that up, you're
gonna get us both killed.

so the warmest plates.

Yes, thank you.

You're welcome.

Oh, you're so good.

I wanna see.

Why don't you put that away?

We should move up here.

What? We should.

Dad, you wouldn't have
to be gone so much.

And, Mom, you could teach
me more wilderness stuff.

It's called survival, honey.

All right, well, I think
we should go to bed.

We got a big day tomorrow here.

Okay.

Let me help you with that.

Oh, hey there.

What are you doing?


Oh, God.

Mm-hm.

You are amazing.

Hm?

Hm?


Tell me a story.

A story?

Mm-hm.

Okay.

There's a small log cabin

with a chimney, by a lake.

Is there a fire?

Oh, there's a fire, baby.

Oh, no.

No?

No, not yet.

Okay, I'm gonna get
through the story quick.


Okay, continue.

There's a small log cabin,
with a chimney, by a lake.

Where the water catches
the sky like a mirror.

It's tucked away by green pines,

and on the porch a man and
a woman sit, holding hands.

Watching the sun disappear.

Together.

Together?

[soft piano music]


[wind howling]

[knives sharpening]

[Lincoln muttering]

Don't do this.


We have to go back.

They need that medicine.
We need to go back.

Your sister, she needs it.

Needs!

You sound like her now.

Need need need, need
need, need need.

You shut the fuck up.

She's playing those
goddam mind games.

I wanna show you something.

You see this?

You know what that is?

You have any idea what that is?

That is all that I need.

That is power.

Yeah.

But it's Desiree's.

It's from before.

I can't open it.

It's her little,
uh, little secret.

But you know them, from
outside the wall, they are some

tricky sons of
bitches, you know.

I mean, it's their shit
that gets in the water,

you know, starts
fucking everybody up.

And these poor people, they
start losing their goddam minds,

and then they tell us, they
tell us, oh yeah, you know,

hey, hey, there's a cure.

And then they cut
us off with the wall

and they kill anybody that
tries to get the word out.

They said that they
were gonna help us.

They said that they were gonna
help anybody that needed it.

[soft dramatic music]


They helped us, all right.

It was the only meat that we
knew that wasn't infected,

being Halifax employees.

You know, outsiders
from the wall,

so we just helped
ourselves to them,

over and over

and over again.

Shit.

That bitch was right.

That need shit.

It is powerful.

[punches striking]


There you are.

A fighter, I like that.

Yeah, I like that.

Hey, hey hey.

Tell me, tell me tell me.

What would you do for that?

What would you give?

[soft dramatic music]

Anything.

And what about that
pretty little lady

of yours, that sweet peach, huh?

What do you think
that she would give?

Oh man, I bet she'd
be real grateful, huh?

Quiet now, quiet.

[soft dramatic music]

[Lincoln screaming]


[generator sputtering]

[monitor beeping]

[wind howling]

You tired of wearing
that sheep's wool

in this little flock of yours?

You done hiding?

Hm.

What?

How many?

How many what?

Men do you have
waiting for him?

Because if it were me,
I'd have left everyone

on guard until I returned.

Waiting.

[Desiree imitating wolf]

My husband isn't coming
back, and until someone

or something does,

it's just you and me.

So, go ahead, keep preaching
your self-righteousness,

your delusional justifications,
because the only one

hiding here, is you.

And I know what you
are, a fucking pussy.


And I've always known what I am.

[gun clicking]

My my my, you are
one angry bitch.

[gun firing]

[monitor beeping]

I will happily watch
you bleed out, happily.

That wasn't part of the deal!

Fuck your deal.

[gun firing]

You wanna fuck this up?

You need them meds and that gas.

[generator sputtering]

[Mia bouncing]

I told you you
shouldn't have come here.

Mia.


[dramatic music]

[lighter striking]

Josh, she's coming!

No, please.


Josh?

Mia?

Get away from her!

Drop it!

Josh?

[bed creaking]

You like the game?

Please, give her that.

She'll be fine.

Fine? She sure
as hell ain't fine.

Look at her.

Stop! Stop!

You gonna drop it?

Please.

Put that.

Please, my children,
they're all I have.

This ain't your
daughter anymore.

I could help her.

This can't be fixed.

Nature must come before nurture.

You shoulda done
what's necessary.

[Mia gasping]

I'm her mother.

You've got another one.

Why'd you shoot that girl?

They came into our home.

know anyone was here.

They were carrying weapons.

Protection!

She was carrying protection,
no different than you and me,

no different than anybody else.

You expect me to believe that?

I don't give two
shits what you believe.

I'm telling you,
she didn't know!

So you came back
to slaughter us?

[Mia gasping]

Don't worry.

That's what I tell her,
same as they told us.

When the water turned,
animals, people,

kept saying, don't worry,
baby, it's gonna be okay.

But I knew, I knew I was lying.

I just needed to make her feel,

to make her feel...

Safe.

You ever done that?

Every day.

Told you.

We ain't that different.

[Mia gasping]

You know, it's fitting, really.

You took my baby away,

now you'll watch me take
what's left of yours.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

I was just trying to
protect my family, my home.

I'll tell you what.

I'll give you a
choice, like your man.

Slide that piece over,
I walk out that door

and we never see
one another again.

Are you a killer?

And you and I can walk
outta here however we like,

kicking and screaming,
it don't matter.

How do I know
you'll keep your word?

This new world of ours?

You don't.

[hard breathing]

Come on out!

You crazy sons of
bitches [fires gun].

[gun firing]


[body thudding]

[hard breathing]

[dramatic music]


Josh, what are you doing?

I watched you
through the window.

We told you to stay.

Your mom and Mia, they need you.

I know.

I was supposed to
watch over Mia and Mom,

but you looked so...

I don't care how
I looked, dammit.

You looked scared!

Just help me.

Thank you, thank you.

Oh, no no no.

No no no.

[soft dramatic music]

Turn around.

Where's the rifle?

I left it in the truck.

All right, I need
you to get this

to your mom and your
sister, all right?

I wanna stay with you.

No, no, listen to me.

I want you to get
out of here now.

But I, I...

[door creaking]

Hide.

[dramatic music]

[Lincoln laughing]

Oh, what have you, uh, turned
into a beautiful butterfly?

And I see that you
have taken a liking

to my, uh, my dinner set.

[soft dramatic music]

Where is it?

Where is it?

[hard breathing]

Come on out [fires gun].

You fucking thief, come on out!

[gun firing twice]

[hard breathing]




Oh, what the fuck?

You ain't no peach,
but you'll do.


[dramatic music]

[blows striking]

[dramatic music]




[dramatic music]


[Lincoln laughing]

You know, I could tell
that was your boy.

You know why? Because all
that pussy smells the same.

Josh, run!

[dart firing]

[Lincoln groaning]

[blows striking]


I'll see you soon!

[blow striking]

[hard breathing]

Come here, come here.

Come here.

You did good.

You did real good.

You didn't hesitate.

Let's go.

Okay, let's go.

Let's go.

Before that sun rises,

you'll choose which
monster lives.

[Mia gasping]

No.

I thought you were stronger.

You ain't done hiding.

Wolves can't hide,
not among the sheep.

[gun firing]

You missed, bitch.

I don't miss.

[ropes swooshing]

[Desiree grunting]

[Joe screaming]

You got bigger balls
than most men I've known.

Keeping them medicated,
hoping and praying.

Instead of doing what's right,

what you shoulda done all along.

Fuck you!



[dramatic music]


[hard breathing]


[soft dramatic music]

[flesh squishing]

Mom?

Oh, okay, that's
it. I'm right here.

That's it, okay.

Josh?

Josh?

Oh God.

[Mia seizing]

I tried.

I tried, baby.

I promise you, I tried.

[Mia seizing]



[dramatic music]

Okay, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Breathe, baby, come on.

[soft dramatic music]

Come on.

[dramatic music]

Breathe, baby.


[soft piano music]

[hard breathing]

[soft piano music]


[soft piano music]


[soft piano music]


We're almost there,
Dad. We're almost home.



[hard breathing]

Keep shining,

Beautiful, keep shining, okay?

[hard breathing]


Josh?


Josh?

[soft piano music]

I'm sorry. I had to help him.

I know, honey. I know you did.

I know.

Where's Mia? What happened?

Sedated.

She's under.

Where is she?


Mom, look, we got the
water and the gasoline

and the food and
all the medicine.

[soft piano music]

That's real good, honey.

Why don't you go,
and can you put that

in the truck for me, please?

Okay.

[soft piano music]



Yeah, I got it.

Okay.

[soft piano music]

What's that?

A chance.

[soft piano music]

Is this?

Yes.

[soft piano music]

I don't know the code.

He said that she was
the only one who had it.

[soft piano music]

[box beeping]

[piano music]

Why don't you go and...

I can't.

I can't go, Joe.

You're not showing
signs of any symptoms.

We don't even know
if you're infected.

I mean, you've
been through hell.

I know, and I would
do it all again for us.

It's too late.

I can, I can feel it.

If we only have one
chance, it's hers.

No.

No, Ethan, listen.

You were right.

See, I have enough now,
and I can keep you under.

So I'll go out and I'll
look because you found this.

No, look, the rest is
for you and the kids, okay?

You are such a
stubborn son of a bitch?

Nobody's coming, Joe!

I saw them.

Nobody's coming.

You were right. I
should have listened.

I'm sorry, I...

I just wanted to protect us.

I thought, I thought
I could protect us.

I'm sorry.

[soft piano music]

Thank you.

For bringing our son home.

I should be thanking him.

[soft piano music]

Keep shining, beautiful.

Good job.

Thanks.

Listen, I gotta go on a run.

Can I come?

Not this time.

But while I'm gone, I
need you to look after

your mom and your sister, okay?

Can you do that?

But I wanna be with you.

Hey.

You're always with me.


Hey.

Hey.

Tell me a story.

[soft piano music]

There's a small cabin
with a chimney, by a lake.

And the water reflects
the sky like a mirror.

Green pine trees
keep it tucked away.

And on the porch, there
sat a man and a woman.

And they're holding
hands and looking out,

watching the sun
disappear, together.

Together.

[soft music]

I love you so much.

I love you.

[soft piano music]

I'll wait for you there.

[soft piano music]

Go.

It's okay.

I can't do it.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I can't do it.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I'm ready.

[wind howling]

[soft dramatic music]


Run.

Go.

Go.

[soft dramatic music]


Josh?

Give me the rifle.


Give me the rifle!

[dramatic music]

[body thudding]

[dramatic music]


[dramatic music]


[body thudding]




Mom!

Hey!

Get away from them, you bitch!







[gun firing]

[dramatic music]


[engine starting]



Go!

[dramatic music]

[tires squealing]

[hard breathing]
