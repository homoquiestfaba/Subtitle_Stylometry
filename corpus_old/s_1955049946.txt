<i>In other news,</i>

<i>Chuckie sol, a made man</i>
<i>in the black mask mob</i>

<i>was kidnapped at gunpoint</i>

<i>by masked assailants</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

<i>Suspicion is high that</i>
<i>sol was a victim</i>

<i>of the recent turf war</i>

<i>raging between the mob</i>
<i>and a new rival gang</i>

<i>composed of high-tech criminals</i>

<i>known to have crossed</i>
<i>paths with Batman.</i>

I don't know about any
weapon shipment, tusk.

Mask don't tell us... ahhh!

You could do better
than that, Chuckie.

We ain't got all night.

Old electrocutioner here gets
mighty ticked when someone lies.

When is that
weapons shipment due?

Wait...

Batman doesn't use guns.

Batman doesn't.

But I do.

I'm just the accountant.

Shut it!

That's no way to treat a lady.

I could've handled
these c-listers on my own.

Dressing like a bat
doesn't make you a hero.

It just makes you a target.

And using a gun makes
you just like them.

I want you out of here.

Now!

Whoa!

Down!

This wasn't a break-in.
Was it, firefly?

Of course not.

They're working
for someone new.

Who?

This is truly an honor, Batman.

I've waited so very long
for this moment.

Though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

Do I know you?

Intimately...

And not at all.

And you rag on me
for stealing your look.

Onyx, now.

Rest well, Batman.

<i>It's not like he punches</i>
<i>a time clock,</i>

<i>but I can assure you that</i>
<i>the Gotham police force</i>

<i>is more than capable of</i>
<i>keeping this city safe.</i>

<i>Even without a masked hero</i>
<i>to back us up.</i>

You're a bad liar, Gordon.

<i>So, are on your way?</i>

Yeah, babe.
You can't believe the traffic.

It's blockbuster!

<i>Can't wait to see you.</i>

<i>It's been weeks, dick.</i>

<i>I've almost forgotten</i>
<i>what you feel like.</i>

I'll remind...

<i>It's...</i>

What's all that noise?

Construction.

Hold on,
I think I see an opening.

Huh?

Yup. All clear, Kori.

I'll be at the tower in fi...

Babe, you have no idea
how sorry I am, but...

<i>But, what about our...</i>

Got a family emergency.

Nightwing out.

Your timing really sucks,
Alfred.

Well, your trip to the rainforest
seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.

With the world tech summit
coming up...

<i>It's not for another week,</i>
<i>Ms. bannister.</i>

<i>We're down here</i>
<i>studying rare herbs</i>

<i>that could prove revolutionary</i>
<i>for medical research.</i>

<i>And earn millions for our</i>
<i>pharmaceutical interests.</i>

All well and good.

But why did you have
to lead the team?

<i>Because it's my company.</i>

<i>And I can do whatever</i>
<i>the bloody hell I want to.</i>

<i>You still have to answer
to this board, Mr. Wayne.</i>

<i>And frankly...</i>

I think we're done here.

If any of you have
further concerns,

bring them to Lucius.

He's more than capable of
handling things while I'm gone.

Oh, dear.

I'd watch those
"bloody hells," governor.

Don't want to be
giving yourself away.

Master dick.

It's bad manners to sneak up
on a person like that.

Sneaking up on people is kind of
what we do around here, Alfred.

That's a joke.

We are not amused.

I'm not exactly in
a festive mood either.

How long has he been gone?

Two weeks, one day,

15 hours.

Wouldn't be the first time.

But he's never
been gone this long

without notifying me
in some way.

Last night, the signal
was up for an hour.

Third time this week.

And if the police are
aware of his absence,

then you can be certain
the criminal class is as well.

There's already been a sharp
uptick in underworld activities.

If Batman doesn't
return soon...

I know.

All bloody hell's
gonna break loose.

Even when you've disappeared,
I can't get away from you.

Oh, Mr. fox.

I think it's way
past time we...

Apologies, Ms. bannister.

I have an important visitor
who simply can't wait.

Huh! That woman!

What's wrong, dad?

Bannister's been barking
at you for years.

You never let her
get under your skin.

Maybe I'm getting
too old for this.

Come on. Let's get some grub.

I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel, Luke.

Too much on my plate
right here.

Of course, if you'd finally accept Mr. Wayne's
offer, we could do lunch every day.

Dad...

With your background
in physics and math...

Dad... -You'd be an
extraordinary asset.

Dad!

I said no before I went into
the service and it's still no.

Why?

You're the one who told me
to follow my own path.

Yes.

But I never thought it would
take you to Afghanistan.

I thought your doctor
told you to give that up.

I've decided
to live dangerously.

Like my daughter.

As I recall,

I picked up the art of dangerous
living from you, colonel Kane.

How are you, dad?

I'm more concerned with
how you are, Kate.

I haven't seen you in weeks.

I was hoping you'd
met some nice girl.

I've been trying to find out something,
anything, about my mystery man.

And...

It's like
he doesn't even exist.

What about his friends?

Vanished without a trace.

I watched that place
blow apart, dad.

There was no way
he could've escaped.

And I keep wondering if
there was something...

Anything that I could've done.

Are you sure he's dead, Kate?

This is Batman
we're talking about.

No one could've survived that.

I need your help on this one.

Your mother always thought
you'd be an artist.

Elizabeth was the one
with the real talent.

<i>Katey. Are you okay?</i>

Kate?

Huh?

I'll see what my network can
dig up on your mystery man.

They keep hoping for
an answer, don't they?

Why don't you give them one.

Not my style.

It seems reports of his death
have been greatly...

Exaggerated.

Watch your back, Kate.

New guy thinks he can move in.

I'm gonna show those punks
who's top dog around here.

Gotham's my bitch.

Which makes you mine, mask.

You're supposed to be dead.

Let me fix that for you.

Damn it!

I bet 50 grand that you
were dead this time.

You lost.

Always bet on black.

Robin?

Somebody kill
this freaking kid!

Damian?

What?

I could've handled this alone.

If that's your best, Batman,
you're not gonna fool anyone,

Grayson.

Maybe you'd like a megaphone
to announce that?

There's no way you're gonna
pull this off without my help.

Modest as ever, I see.

I'm more Batman
than you'll ever be.

Just follow my lead.

We're being tailed.

You've been
tracking me all night.

I want to know why.

First, tell me why you're running
around Gotham playing dress-up.

I'm guessing nightwing?

Hmm! Busted.

Actually, I think he's more than
capable of fooling most people.

And you're certainly not gonna
pass for Batman, short stack.

Who the hell are you?

Easy, Robin.

Tell me what you want and
why you've been following me.

I just had to make sure.

You see, I was there
the night Batman died.

<i>He threw me clear</i>
<i>and saved my life.</i>

But before I could get back
up here it blew apart.

And we're just supposed
to believe that?

Believe what you want.

I don't trust her.

Oh, but you did trust Talon.

Shut up.

Who was it? Who were tusk
and firefly working for?

I don't know.

But when I find out, I'll
drop a note in your lunchbox.

If you're serious about hunting them
down then we should work together.

Just because I wear this,

doesn't mean I'm a part
of your little cult.

You really have a way
with women, Grayson.

Do you think he's really dead?

I don't know.

You'd like it, wouldn't you...

If he never came back?

Then you get to keep that suit.

I've struggled for years to
get out of Bruce's shadow,

to build a life for myself

as far away from
his world as possible.

And the last thing I want

is to be wearing
this damn thing!

<i>Um...</i>

<i>I've finally managed to locate
master Bruce's files on Batwoman.</i>

How come I never heard of her?

<i>She's kept a rather</i>
<i>low profile.</i>

Not low enough for Batman,
I'll bet.

<i>Investigative report</i>
<i>on Batwoman,</i>

<i>aka Katherine Kane.</i>

Katey?

You know her?

<i>Her father is</i>
<i>colonel Jacob Kane.</i>

<i>Military intelligence.</i>

<i>On Katherine's 12th birthday, she and her
twin sister Elizabeth were abducted,</i>

<i>along with their mother,</i>
<i>Gabrielle,</i>

<i>and held for ransom.</i>

<i>Colonel Kane led a rescue
mission that saved Kate's life.</i>

<i>But in the attempt both Gabrielle
and Elizabeth were murdered.</i>

<i>She would follow in her father's
footsteps, enrolling at west point,</i>

<i>but ultimately expelled.</i>

<i>Something broke inside Kate.</i>

<i>Two years later, Katherine</i>
<i>emerged as Batwoman.</i>

<i>She's impressive,</i>

<i>but her methods make her</i>
<i>a danger to this city.</i>

<i>And to herself.</i>

<i>It's time for me to decide if.</i>

<i>I'm going to take her</i>
<i>under my wing...</i>

<i>Or take her down.</i>

Poor katey.

It always begins with death.
Doesn't it, Alfred?

<i>I'm as astonished as you are,</i>
<i>master dick.</i>

Anyone mind filling me in?

How do you know her?

I just do.

I had to dig very deep,
my dear,

reach out to contacts that
even I find somewhat unsavory.

But here he is,

your mystery man.

The heretic.
That's his accomplice.

Onyx.

Heretic?

What kind of name is that?

One that invokes disbelief.

His accomplishments
certainly do.

In the last 10 months, he has quietly
forged some dangerous alliances,

as well as become a Thorn
in the side of black mask.

He may have gathered half the criminals
in Gotham under his command.

But who is he?

All I know is, that he's left
a trail of empty vaults

and dead bodies
across this city.

And as your experience attests,

he seems to have
a fixation with Batman.

With all due respect, dad,
that doesn't help much.

I'm sorry.

I just need to figure
this out on my own.

I'll see you back at the house.

Don't worry, Kate.

I won't let you down again.

If you're gonna keep standing
me up for dinner, dad,

you could at least call.

Oh, god. Luke, I'm sorry.

I'm just swamped.

It's not just the summit,
is it?

Excuse me?

This has something to do with
the fact that Batman's missing.

Batman?

Dad, you've been bringing
me here since I was a kid.

I've seen enough over
the years to figure out that

there's some connection between
Wayne enterprises and Batman.

Somehow I missed that in
the last stockholder's report.

In fact, if I was gonna make
an educated guess,

I'd say you supply him
with some of his tech.

That's some theory.

Dad, I just...

It's coming from Wayne tech.

The vault.

Don't play games with me.

I don't know about any vault.

Fine.

Kill him.

Get us into the vault, Mr. fox,

or your son becomes a memory.

Stop!

Ooh, look at all these
magnificent toys.

You know what we need, Kuttler.

Yes. A fleet of trucks,
so we can take it all.

But for now, the components
will have to do.

How could you know?

This is the 21st century,
Mr. fox.

There are no secrets
in this world anymore.

Dad!

Except the ones
we take to our graves.

Ahhh!

You dare to wear
the mantle of the bat.

Get to the transport.

The boy.

Ahhh!

Electrocutioner, stop!

You're gonna fry up real good,

you stupid little...

Come back
and fight, you cowards!

Damn it.

Help!

He needs an ambulance.

You want more, Bruce?

Don't take it all for yourself.

Don't worry, ladies.

There's plenty of me
to go around.

Mother's pearls?

Where did you get those?

Where did you get them?

<i>What the hell is this?</i>

Ah!

Still no progress, Tetch?

So much memory.

So much experience.

It's a delicate job, threading
my way through the layers.

You, on the other hand, could
be reprogrammed in an hour.

You're like wet sand,
compared to this concrete.

His trauma runs so deep.

It's as if he defines himself
by his pain.

Such madness.

Huh?

You have to dig deeper.

Push past the trauma.

To the child he was, before
he lost his precious parents.

Then, you'll break him.

And then, he'll be ours.

You make it sound
so easy, Talia.

Easier than dying, Mr. Tetch.

We had the detonators. But the
bat was there, waiting for us.

Grayson.

Not just him.

The boy.

Of course.

He was nearly killed,
but I saved him.

I saved him.

I would expect no less.

We should capture Damian.
Bring him here.

I prefer to keep my son
at arm's length.

For now.

But if we remove him from the
battle till it's over, then...

I've told you, no.

I know why you want
the boy, heretic.

I'd stay away from that
rabbit hole, if I were you.

Mind your own business, Tetch.

Nothing would give
me more pleasure.

I'm so sorry, Luke.

That's all you have to say?

I was in the vault, dick.
I know.

Listen, I don't think
this is the time.

My dad might feel differently,

if he could talk.

I came home from one war, only
to walk right into another one.

And I want to be a part of it.

Best way to help is right
here, at your father's side.

I'm a soldier, dick.

I need to be on
the front lines,

not stuck in some lab or boardroom
or freakin' bedside chair.

And last night, I saw the
weapons that could help me.

Weapons that my dad created
and almost got killed for.

No, Luke, listen.

I understand, I really do,
but it's not my call.

Not right now. Things are complicated.
Trust me, okay?

Dick...
Alfred.

I'm on it.

I got to run. I'm sorry.

God, I haven't laughed
like that in so long.

I noticed you were pretty
miserable when you came in.

One of those days?

One of those lives.

Excuse me!

So, you're a cop?

A detective.

You have a problem with that?

No, not at all.

You just don't look the part.

What's a cop
supposed to look like?

Not as hot as you.

Did I just say that out loud?

Uh... yeah, you did.

You're good.

Actually, I'm terrible.

I haven't dated
in over a year and I...

Is something wrong?
What? No.

No.

No. Look,
I do have to go, but...

Can I give you my card?
Call me?

Yeah, right.

That's not a line, Rene, I...

I like you, I really do.

But something's come up.

Where's the kid?

I thought we could
talk alone, katey.

How long have you known?

Me? Not long.

But Batman's been on to you
from the start.

Look, just so you know,
I haven't given up. I just...

Needed to clear my head.

We all need to take off
the mask sometimes.

To remind ourselves that
we're people underneath.

Dick Grayson.

You know, when we were kids and I'd see
you at all those society bashes...

I had quite a crush on you.

Really? I thought you
were totally annoying.

Took me a while to get a
hang of the girl thing.

Yeah, me too.

Why reveal yourself?

Call it a hunch. Come on.

I don't have a concussion.

I wasn't aware you received
a medical degree

while you were in the
himalayas, master Damian.

I've been hurt worse than this
sparring with my grandfather.

I'd hardly hold Ra's al ghul up

as an example of
enlightened child-rearing.

Master dick was quite explicit.

At least 24 hours
of observation.

He's not my father!

And neither are you.

And for that, young man,

you should be
profoundly grateful.

He saved my life
once before, you know.

In a way, he created me.

Yeah, he does that.

He pissed me off.

He does that, too.

<i>When I got</i>
<i>kicked out of the military,</i>

<i>my life was a blur of sex,</i>
<i>drugs and techno-house.</i>

<i>But I thought I could</i>
<i>take care of myself.</i>

How ya doin', gorgeous?

Out of my way, asshole.

I don't think so.

You little bitch!

You're welcome.

After that night, I swore I'd never
need Batman or anyone saving me again.

My mother and sister were victims
of the animals out there.

Not me.

I get that, Kate.

But it doesn't mean
you have to be alone.

Ahhh!

You made a big mistake
coming here.

I was trained to never
make mistakes.

Just like you.

Don't fight it, Damian.

I've had the flaws
bred out of me.

But you... You're just a boy.

What was it like
growing up with him?

When I was a kid,
I idolized him.

Hell, I wanted to be him.

But the older I got,
the more I realized

that I didn't know him at all.

How could I?

Bruce Wayne is as
much a mask as Batman.

And I think the only thing
behind those masks is pain.

A pain he refuses
to share with anyone.

So what was it like?

Lonely.

It's Alfred.

Your Butler
is a part of this, too?

Trust me, he's a total badass.

Yeah?

<i>Master Damian is gone, sir.</i>

Where am I?

What the hell are you doing?

Unfortunately, I have no more
choice in this than you do.

Who are you?

I'm you, Damian...

All grown up.

You're not me. You can't be.

I'm the product of
a program that your...

Our grandfather initiated.

He wanted to create
the perfect soldier.

They used your DNA

and put it through a process
of accelerated growth.

Most of the prototypes
died quickly.

But I survived.

I was the strongest
of them all.

Still...

I was an empty shell,
till Mr. Tetch here

brought me to
full consciousness.

And as good a job as he did,

there's always been
something missing.

A void.

And I'm going
to fill that void...

With you.

Everything in there

is going in here.

You, brother,

will provide me with a soul.

The hell, I am.

I don't understand

why she just doesn't grow
another one of you.

She's got a freezer full...
Are you insane?

Mother.

How dare you!

It wasn't my idea.

This lunatic said
he'd kill me if I...

Shut up!

You'll suffer for this.

My entire life
I've been suffering!

Tell me, what is a man
without memories?

I want to know you,

and love you, as he does.

I want to feel you in my heart.

In my blood.

I've always served you
without question.

I've never asked
anything of you.

Please, let me have this.

You poor tormented creature,

how could I not have felt
the depths of your pain?

How could a mother have
left her child so alone...

In the dark.

How could you
just kill him like that?

He was...
He was flawed.

What about me,
am I flawed, too?

Remove all memories
of this incident

and then make the other
necessary adjustments.

Adjustments?

You're of no use
to me like this.

Recalcitrant, emotional.

Your father's influence,
no doubt.

Onyx, get this
trash out of here.

Good thing Alfred
had the foresight

to put a tracker on
the kid's uniform.

The sisters of perpetual grace.

A respected religious order
with missions across the world.

Perfect front
for criminal scumbags.

This isn't gonna be easy.

Nuns with m60s and katanas?

That would make them nunjas.

Kind of hate I let you talk
me into using rubber bullets.

Looks like you
could use a little help.

Hello, nurse.

Luke?

You want a megaphone
to announce that?

Call me Batwing.

Batwing? That's original.

Can't say I'm not
glad to see you.

It's the bats.

Three of them!

Three?

We retreat.

Why?

The compound is expendable.

We have more urgent matters
to attend to.

Come.

Kill him! Kill him!

Aah!

It's me, it's your son.

Come on, father.

Batman, we need you.

Can you blow those doors?

God's not going to like this.

I don't think she's
been here for a while.

This way!

Come on, father.

How are you?

In one piece, which is more
than I can say for this place.

No.

Thanks for saving
our butts back there, Luke.

Yeah, too bad they got away.

Well, dad always wanted me
to work with Bruce Wayne.

I'm proud to be
a part of your team.

We can handle this on our own.

Nightwing, Robin,
back to Gotham.

You're welcome.

You really should be resting.

The summit's tomorrow.

It's been a week, I'm fine.

Like father, like son.

All things considered,
master Bruce,

you're in surprisingly
good condition.

She treated you...
Treated us...

Like we were machines
that she could just program.

That's all we were to her.

After Bruce Wayne completes his
hosting duties at the summit,

we'll gather any leads
we can to find her.

Why wait? I'll call in
Kate and Luke and then...

No.

You shouldn't have involved
them in the first place.

Batwing pretty much
involved himself.

And Batwoman?

Did she force you
to reveal our secrets?

You weren't here, sir.

Master dick made
a judgment call,

and I think it was
the right one.

Maybe so, but from here on...

It's only family.

Kate's going through the hard
drive we pulled from the convent.

Fine, but when she's done,
that's it.

But we have to... -You're
not Batman anymore, dick!

I call the shots around here.

He's been through an extraordinary
ordeal, master dick.

Yeah? Well, so have we.

As the summit kicks off today,

politicians and dignitaries
from more than 20 nations

converge on Gotham, for what
promises to be

<i>a pivotal look at how technology
will shape our future.</i>

<i>Minutes ago, Bruce Wayne...</i>

<i>arrived to deliver</i>
<i>the keynote address</i>

<i>that will kick off</i>
<i>the conference</i>

<i>and also unveil ground-breaking
technological advances.</i>

<i>Up next, researchers discover</i>
<i>mysterious findings on Mars...</i>

What do you mean he
doesn't want my help?

He says he's grateful for
everything you've done, Kate,

but he just feels that...

Oh, hell, you know
what he's like.

He just wants to keep it
in the family.

I thought you wanted me
to be part of the family.

Yeah, what do I know?

<i>Find anything on that</i>
<i>hard drive, yet?</i>

No, I gave it to Batwing.

I figured his father's tech
could help us.

<i>I'm sorry about this, Kate.</i>

If it were up to me...

Nothing to be sorry about.
Goodbye, dick.

Dad!

<i>As the co-chair of</i>
<i>Wayne enterprises,</i>

<i>it is my profound privilege</i>
<i>to present our host.</i>

<i>A man of fellowship,</i>

<i>a man of kindness,</i>

<i>a man of peace.</i>

<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne.</i>

Soon, we'll be through
the looking glass, gentlemen.

<i>You're all wearing beta</i>
<i>versions of Wayne tech's</i>

<i>latest breakthrough</i>
<i>in communications.</i>

<i>With these translators,</i>

<i>we hope to build Bridges</i>
<i>between language and culture.</i>

Hmm.
What?

We're about to take
over the world.

Can't a man dress
for the occasion?

Idiot!

Walrus.

<i>The world has become</i>
<i>a more dangerous place.</i>

<i>To meet these threats,</i>
<i>Wayne tech and S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

<i>have developed</i>
<i>the watchtower initiative.</i>

<i>Prepare to embark</i>
<i>on the greatest adventure.</i>

Dad doesn't even
remember doing it.

He was programmed.

But why?

Somehow, they knew
I had that drive.

Like they knew about the vault
at Wayne enterprises.

Bruce told them.

Not my father.

Talia had him
in there for weeks

and he suddenly snaps out of
it just because we show up?

No, you're wrong. He's fine.

No, he's not.

He's not fine.

She got to him.

She's not finished, is she?

She's just getting started.

Found this on the hard drive.

There are vice-presidents
on this list.

Military and corporate leaders,

the vice-chancellor of Germany.

So, why would Talia have this?

What if Talia got to the men and women
on that list, brainwashed them?

Then that would place the league of
shadows' influence in every country.

She'd control the world.

My god, kid,
your mom's got game.

And all the leaders she would
need are at the summit...

Along with Bruce Wayne.

Master...

Status?

Just a second.

Activating power boost.

You're on, Tetch.

Beginning brain wave
synchronization.

<i>So many minds.</i>

<i>So little time.</i>

And a new age dawns.

Even Ra's al ghul
couldn't achieve this.

<i>Hey, Batwing,</i>
<i>need a ride in the... Batwing?</i>

<i>Very funny.</i>

You sure they won't
know we're coming?

<i>Not once we jam their radar and
shut down the alarm system.</i>

Good thing you got us
those schematics.

<i>Hope my dad understands</i>

<i>when he finds out</i>
<i>I hacked his computer.</i>

Got 'em.

Engaging auto-pilot.

Heads up, looks like
we've got company.

How long, Kuttler?

Twenty minutes at most.

Make it 10.

Get it.

I brought you
a little something.

We've got to find the
dignitaries and evacuate them.

What about father?

Our first priority is
getting those people out.

Not mine.

We don't have time
for this, Damian.

Join us or die.

Father.

<i>The league of shadows</i>
<i>compels you to be one with us.</i>

<i>There is no you.</i>

<i>You have no home.</i>

<i>You have no people.</i>

Ahhh!

That can't be good.

<i>You are the league of shadows</i>
<i>and it is your home.</i>

<i>We are your people.</i>

About time you came back.

Indeed.

Come on!

No!

Justice!

Not vengeance.

Damn.

<i>Batwing to Robin. Uh...</i>

Got a situation here.

I need you to manually
transfer power

from the damaged thruster
to the remaining two.

Oh, crap!

Dad's gonna kill me.

Big dirty...

<i>The league of shadows...</i>

Shut it down.

<i>You have no...</i>

<i>You are the league</i>
<i>of shadows...</i>

Bloody hell.

Huh?

<i>Cutting it kinda close!</i>

<i>Hurry up, kid!</i>

Well done, beloved.

We will at least
have this victory.

Finish him.

Bruce! Don't.

That's what
it's all about in the end,

isn't it, mother?

Not the vision
of a better world

my grandfather had.

It's just about control.

Start with the bastard.

We can always make more.

Bruce, you don't kill.

You've never killed.

Don't let her win.

Don't let her take your soul.

If anything,
I have cleansed it.

I washed away his trauma.

Finish them.

You brought us all together

because you
understood our pain,

our loneliness better
than anyone else could.

We needed family.

We needed you.

Shoot him!

You're not just a mask.

You're a man.

The best man I've ever known.

No!

Can't fight it.

Yes, you can, damn it!

For the little boy who
lost his world in that alley.

Enough!

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

It's all right, father.

That's for what you did
to my father, bitch!

It's over, mother.

Your grand plan has ended.

How is it I ever loved
either of you?

I don't think you ever did.

Oh, beloved, you have no idea.

I have thought of little else
for the last 12 years.

But nothing, not my passion,

not the death of my father,

not even our child
could bring you to my side.

I know now,
I will never have you

in this life.

But perhaps, in death.

Get her!

She played us again.

From what nightwing said,

once the programming
is broken, it can't be reset.

Not yours, not anybody's.

Well, I suppose Tetch could've done
it, if he hadn't lost his head.

I'm proud of you, Kate.

Gabrielle and Elizabeth
would be proud, too.

I hope so.

I'm a... a little early.

No, no.

You're right on time.

I'm heading to the tower.

Thanks for lunch, Alfred.

What's going on?
Master Bruce is having

a heart-to-heart with Damian.

One can't help feeling bad.

Despite her madness,

she was his mother.
