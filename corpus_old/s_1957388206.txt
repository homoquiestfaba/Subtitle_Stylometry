Man:
Ladies and gentlemen,

the good news quartet.

â™ª He will give me
grace and glory â™ª

â™ª grace and glory â™ª

â™ª he will give me
grace and glory â™ª

â™ª grace and glory â™ª

â™ª he will give me
grace and glory â™ª

â™ª and go with me,
with me all the way... â™ª

â™ª Where he leads me,
I will follow â™ª

â™ª I will follow â™ª

â™ª Iâ€™ll go with him,

â™ª He will give me
grace and glory â™ª

â™ª and go with me,
with me all the way â™ª

â™ª all the way. â™ª

Woman:
Over my dead body.

Mrs. Stiles, as I have
told you many times this year

to check the progression
of your illness

we need to see inside you.

Look, Dr. Peters, whatâ€™s
going on inside of me

looks a lot like
whatâ€™s going on outside of me.

Grace...

Listen, young lady,

if god wanted you
to look in my body

heâ€™d have given me a window.

Now, just take me back
to my penthouse.

But, grace...
Now!

Please listen
to me.

You hear?

Yes, maâ€™am.

Roy.

Hello, Mr. Dudley.

You know, Mr. Anders is
beginning to lose Patience.

There are bulldozers
already on the property

based on
your say-so.

I know, Mr. Dudley.

Honestly, I do.

This is the contract
Mr. Andersâ€™ company

has prepared for the purchase
of your grandmotherâ€™s farm.

You may want
to have your own
lawyer go over it.

My grandma donâ€™t put
much stock in lawyers.

Youâ€™ve been in banking
for a long time now.

If you say
itâ€™s a good deal

weâ€™ll take
your word for it.

Then all we need

is your grandmotherâ€™s
signature.

â™ª In the sweet by-and-by â™ª

( Grace singing along ):
â™ª we will meet
on the beautiful shore â™ª

â™ª in the sweet by-and-by â™ª

â™ª we will meet
on the beautiful shore â™ª

â™ª when the trumpet
of the lord... â™ª

I canâ€™t believe
the difference in the garden

since you came here.

Yeah, well, thatâ€™s
the only reason

I let my grandson put me in here
when I broke my hip.

Your garden looked worse
than me.

It does look pretty good,
donâ€™t it?

Mm-hmm.

Would you look at that?

Would you...

Bernice!

Bernice!

You interrupted
my ball scores.

Help me up, dear.

There you go.

Bernice...

Thank you.

You said that
my hymn-singing

wouldnâ€™t make the peppers
get any bigger.

Take a look at that.

All your hymn-singing does
is set my teeth on edge.

In my prayers every morning,
I ask god why he would send me

an honorary old heathen

like you for
a roommate.

Iâ€™ve told you
a hundred times, grace.

There is no god.

Only fools

believe otherwise.

Well, if thatâ€™s true,
I am proud to be

the biggest fool
in creation.

Ladies, please.

Thank you.

I would kill for some lox
on a sesame bagel.

Really?

Lox?

Yeah.

We have lox here.

Seriously? Lox?

They do. Yeah.

Look.
Over here

near the door hinges
and doorknobs.

You see we got locks,
we got padlocks

we got front locks...

David, I am starting
to worry about you.

Even your sense of humor
is turning country.

Yeah, but you
still love me.

You guys need help?

Um, yeah. We do.

Actually, we do.
Weâ€™re looking for a, uh...

Steamer.

Steamer.
To take about

ten layers of paper

off the bedroom wall.

Try valley rent-all
down on south main.

Theyâ€™ll fix you right up.

Youâ€™re the new lawyer,
arenâ€™t you?

New to this
state, anyway.

Hi.
David greenwood.

Lou Edwards.

Your new partnerâ€™s
my brother-in-law.

You must be Gloria.

Small... world.

You guys miss New York?

A little.

Well, if you ever
need anything...

imported cheese, olives,

smoked salmon... you let me know.

Iâ€™ll have it shipped in for you
overnight.

Thanks, Lou.
Appreciate that.

You see?

Things are looking up
a little bit, right?

Yeah.
Yeah?

I donâ€™t say often enough

how much I appreciate
you doing this.

Iâ€™ve always dreamed
of living the country life.

Mm-hmm.

I know itâ€™s
an adjustment

but I think once
you get a job...

I have a job
and I like it.

Youâ€™re volunteering.

Letâ€™s just
go get the steamer...

Whoa!

Iâ€™m so sorry.

Oh, no.

Oh, look at you.

Are you okay?

Are you all right?
Huh?

Iâ€™m fine, maâ€™am.

No problem, really.

Yeah. Okay.

Honey, the
boyâ€™s okay.

Honey...

Honey, let him go.

Sweetheart.
Heâ€™s okay.

Honey,
come on.

Yeah.

Heâ€™s fine now.
Let him go.

All right.

Here you
go, pal.

Sorry about that.

Bye-bye.

Bye.

Okay?

Mm-hmm.

All right?

All right.

Yeah.

You know what?

Iâ€™m going
to drive.

Yeah. You drive.

Okay.

Oh, I must look a fright.

I saw the doctors today

and they just stuffed me
so full of holes.

Itâ€™s a wonder
Iâ€™m not leaking
all over the place.

( Coughing )

Okay?

Excuse me.

Arthur Gilford came by.

Got the furniture
from the big house.

He said some of the pieces
are heirloom quality.

Really?

Mr. Pitt from
the auction barn came

and got most
everything else.

I hate your having to do this
by yourself, Roy.

Charlene helps some.

Thatâ€™s good.

Well, I told you that, uh

that I saw the
doctor earlier

and, honey,
I donâ€™t expect

that I have too
much more time.

Dr. Peters called me.

She also said that youâ€™re
not taking your medicine.

That medicine...

Itâ€™s painkillers.

I donâ€™t know why everybodyâ€™s
so fired up around here

to fill me up with painkillers.

None of their business.

Grandma...

About the farm...

This land developer,
Mr. Anders...

heâ€™s offering us
a real good price

but he is not going
to wait forever

and if we have to wait
until youâ€™re, you know...

Gone...

Yeah.

Then, uh, then
weâ€™re going to have

all sorts
of legal hassles

which no one wants.

Oh, no more than me, honey.

Listen, grandma...

If itâ€™s your things
that youâ€™re worried about

Mr. Anders said we can store it
all down in the granny cottage.

We can keep it there
all winter if necessary.

And, that way, if you
need something up here...

Roy... Roy...

Youâ€™re right.

Itâ€™s time.

Itâ€™s time to sell.

Youâ€™ll sign the contract?

They wonâ€™t touch my orchards.

Why would they
touch your orchard?

The whole shebang
is named for it.

"Apple glade resort."

Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re calling it.

Fancy.

You should see.

They got a big old sign
on the hill

where grandpa
used to have
his still.

Honey, your grandpa
never had a still.

Yes, maâ€™am.

Now, uncle Enis,
grandpaâ€™s brother

he did have a still

and grandpa sometimes
tended it for him

but it... it was
just to help out.

Write your name
right there.

Right.

There. Thatâ€™s done, then.

But, Roy,

whatâ€™s going to happen
to the money?

If your grandmaâ€™s really
going to die...

bless her soul...

well, whatâ€™s going
to happen to the money?

Well, I havenâ€™t asked her,
Charlene.

I think itâ€™s all going
to pay the medical bills.

Well, you got to ask her, Roy.

Youâ€™re her only kin
in these parts.

You help out
night and day
with everything

under the sun.

Your daddy, bless his soul

was her favorite.

Why shouldnâ€™t you
get the money?

I donâ€™t like asking her,
Charlene

and thatâ€™s all.

Now let it be!

Grace:
Iâ€™ve been thinking

about luanne.

You know, my grandniece...

the one thatâ€™s been
writing me all those letters.

All these years, sheâ€™s written.

I think sheâ€™s
kind of fascinated with me

because Iâ€™m her oldest
living relative.

Anyway, she was going
to come see me this spring

and donâ€™t you know

three days before she was due,
I fell down.

Roy had to call her
and tell her not to come.

She was so sad.

She really did want
to see my apple orchard.

So, I got thinking about it

and... then I got a notion

and I got a way that might
show her my orchard.

Itâ€™s not finished,
but I want to let you see it

because I think youâ€™ll get
a good idea.

There.

Look at that.

What do you think?

Bernice?

Bernice?

Oh...

I know youâ€™d yell at me
for saying this

but... I bet anything
you believe in god now.

You donâ€™t understand.

She has to stay here.

We canâ€™t keep her
against her will, Roy.

And sheâ€™ll be
more comfortable at home.

Donâ€™t worry.

Someone from hospice
will visit the farm today.

I told you. She
sold the farm.

If your grandmother avails
herself of their services.

Thank you.

Here I am.

Pharmacy had it
all ready.

Now, I showed you
how to use the drops for pain.

Any other questions,
thereâ€™s a leaflet inside

for you to read.

I... I donâ€™t want it.

Itâ€™s just a waste.

Youâ€™re going
to need it, grace.

One more thing.

Keep it.

Bernice would have
wanted you to have it.

Oh, well, thank you.

Call us. Let us know
if thereâ€™s anything you need.

Sure.

Thank you.

Sheâ€™s got the medicine.

Make sure
she uses it.

Iâ€™ll try.

You know my grandma.

You know how stubborn she is
about taking her medicine.

Yeah. I know.

Iâ€™d take you home
with me, but youâ€™ve
seen our place.

Oh, honey, I donâ€™t
want to live with you.

Well, then, you
should have stayed
at the nursing home.

Roy, I donâ€™t want to die

in a cold, dreary room
like Bernice.

I want to die at home.

Man:
Now, get two other guys
to hold that up.

Man #2:
Get them over here right away.

Man #3:
Right here.

What are you
doing here?

Oh, praise heaven.

I thought my bones
was going to come out

right through my skin.

Hold on. Hold on.

Wait a second.

Let me help you there.

Oh... oh, dear.

Just... help me there.

Oh, thatâ€™s it.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

( Sighing )

Careful. Just lean on me.

Well, Iâ€™m glad
to be here.

I understand, grandma, but this
farm isnâ€™t yours anymore.

Your Mr. Anders said I could
put my personal belongings

in the granny cottage.

And this body of mine is the
most personal belonging I got.

This old place...

Goodness.

You sit there.

Okay.

Okay?

Yeah.

Iâ€™ll get the bed made.

Want some fresh air?

Yeah.

Donâ€™t you have
to go to work, honey?

Oh, I called Ernie.
Heâ€™s cool.

Iâ€™ll put some towels
in the bathroom.

You need an extra quilt?

No. No. Huh-uh.

Okay, listen.

I, uh, I got to go
to the bank

to see Mr. Dudley, pay
off everything we owe.

On the way, Iâ€™ll
stop and Iâ€™ll get
some groceries.

You be okay here
for a few hours?

Iâ€™ll be just fine.

Let me help you into bed.

Okay.

Oops.

I got you.

I got you.

I got it.

There we go.

Are you sure thereâ€™s
nothing else that you need?

No.

No. Just my knitting

and, uh, that little,
uh, you know,

that little black
walk-a-thon thing.

Yeah. Okay.

Thank you.

I see your Mr. Saunders died
peacefully in his sleep.

It was his time.

He was 96.

Although the day
before he died...

He proposed to me.

And now Iâ€™m hoping
that my turning him down

isnâ€™t what killed him.

Youâ€™ve done beautifully

with your first two
assignments, Gloria.

Thanks.

So, where to next?

Next?

You just lost
a patient.

Donâ€™t you want
to take a break?

I told you,
Winnie

I like to keep busy.

I come from the corporate world
of 14-hour work days.

Looks like we
got a lively one.

A Mrs. Grace stiles.

When she went home

from the nursing
home today

she stashed
her pain medication

in the planter
by the front door.

Winnie:
Gloria, this is
Rosemary Allbright.

Sheâ€™s been a hospice
volunteer for six years.

They donâ€™t come
any better.

I pay her to say that.

Winnie:
How would you two
like to take on

Mrs. Grace stiles?

Rosemary:
It says in
her paperwork

she lives in
the cottage.

What in the world
is going on?

Gloria:
I have no idea.

But a terminally ill woman

shouldnâ€™t have
to put up with this.

Try around to the left.

That looks
like a cottage.

Grace:
â™ª no spot is so dear
to my childhood â™ª

â™ª as the little brown church
in the vale â™ª

â™ª thereâ€™s a church in the valley
by the Wildwood â™ª

â™ª no lovelier place
in the Dale â™ª

â™ª no spot is so dear
to my childhood... â™ª

Good set of lungs.

Mrs. Stiles?

Mrs. Stiles?

â™ª Oh, come to the church
in the Wildwood â™ª

â™ª oh, come to the church
in the vale... â™ª

Mrs. Stiles?

â™ª No spot is so dear
to my childhood â™ª

Mrs. Stiles? Hello?
â™ª as the little brown church
in the vale... â™ª

Gloria:
You left your
door unlocked

so weâ€™re letting
ourselves in.

Mrs. Stiles?

Mrs. Stiles.

Hello?
( Gasps )

Sorry. Didnâ€™t mean
to startle you.

Iâ€™m Gloria greenwood

and this is
Rosemary Allbright.

Weâ€™re from hospice.

How we doing,
Mrs. Stiles?

Everything
all right?

Ladies, I can tell
by your lips moving

that youâ€™re talking

but I canâ€™t hear
a blessed word your saying.

And itâ€™s not
â€™cause Iâ€™m deaf

if thatâ€™s what
youâ€™re thinking.

Itâ€™s this Walkman,
handy long thing.

I just thought that me

and the, you know,
good news quartet

maybe we could drown
out some of that
racket out there.

Is there anyone
here with you,
Mrs. Stiles?

Well, I do
believe you are.

Iâ€™m sure I read
that your grandson...

Roy.

Roy... heâ€™s looking
after you?

Thatâ€™s right. He had
some things to do.

And he left you
here alone?

Heâ€™ll be back later.

But you need someone
here with you.

What for?

To care for you.

Rosemary:
Iâ€™m going
to call hospice.

Winnie Bradley should
know about this.

May I use your phone?

Yes. Around the corner.

It donâ€™t work, though.

It hasnâ€™t
been connected

up here in the cottage
since Gabriella stiles

you know

she passed on.

Gloria...

I should go back
and report this.

Not only is the
poor woman unattended

but sheâ€™s stranded
in the middle

of a construction site
without even a phone.

Iâ€™ll go over
the hospice agreement with her

while youâ€™re gone.

Are you going
to be all right
until I get back?

Yes, weâ€™ll be fine.

Whereâ€™s she going?

Is she going
after Roy?

No, we came to talk with you,
Mrs. Stiles, not Roy.

When you left
the nursing home
this morning

you forgot your
medication.

I didnâ€™t forget it.

I told them
I didnâ€™t want it.

I told them so.
Didnâ€™t they
tell you that?

Yes, but...

Then what are you driving
out here pestering me for?

Mrs. Stiles,
may I sit down?

Listen, you people
have to learn something.

May I please
sit down?
You canâ€™t always...

Honey, Iâ€™m not
the queen of England.

If you want to sit, sit.

Thank you.

Rosemary and I
are volunteers

from an organization
called hospice.

Didnâ€™t your doctor
tell you about us?

Well, she mightâ€™ve.

But sheâ€™s one of them
medical women.

Talks a whole lot faster
than I can listen.

I see.

Have you had
any lunch?

Listen, dear, whatever
youâ€™re selling

I know Iâ€™m way past
needing it.

The nurse told me
you didnâ€™t touch

your breakfast
this morning.

So I packed a thermos
of chicken soup.

You know, one
of the services
hospice provid...

What is it,
Mrs. Stiles?

Do you need to go
to the bathroom?

Well, yes, I do,
if you must know.

Iâ€™ve been sitting
here all day

just trying to get up
enough strength.

You havenâ€™t been
to the bathroom
since this morning?

Itâ€™s the middle
of the afternoon.

Believe me, I know.

I was doing fine, too

until that good news quartet
got me all revved up.

I donâ€™t know...

I donâ€™t think
I can...

You can do it.

All right.

Oh, no, Iâ€™m too dizzy.

No, it hurts too much.

I got to lie down.

Okay.

Iâ€™m going to get
your pain medication.

No drugs.

How many times do I have
to tell you people.

This ainâ€™t pain anyway.

You ever been in labor?

Yes, I have.

Well, then you know
what real pain is.

Up at the big
house up there

I had four babies.

Four boys.

The first one
come out feet first

hung onto my ribs
for 20 hours.

What are we going
to do about this?

Well, Iâ€™m just going to
have to hold it, I guess.

You canâ€™t hold it.

Oh, honey, I was
the youngest

of 13 children.

We had one outhouse.

Believe me, I got
so I could hold
my water a week

standing in front
of Ruby falls.

I donâ€™t suppose
you have a bedpan.

Why didnâ€™t I think
to bring one?

Well, itâ€™s not the kind
of thing you usually take

calling on a person.

How about this?

Thatâ€™s a soup tureen.

That belonged to
Gabriella stiles...

my husbandâ€™s mother.

Sentimental value?

Well, letâ€™s put it this way...

Gabriella, she lived with us
19 years.

19 of the slowest years
of my life.

It does have
the right shape.

Well, it does, doesnâ€™t it?

No, no.

No, we just canâ€™t
be thinking it.

Mrs. Stiles, I probably
shouldnâ€™t even say this

but if I had
the opportunity

to do it in my
mother-in-lawâ€™s

soup tureen...

( Both laughing )

Thatâ€™s a... thatâ€™s
a very nice suggestion

but you got to realize
Iâ€™m going to meet

Gabriella stiles
very soon.

Can you imagine spending
all eternity

with her following me around

crabbing about
her soup tureen?

Well, then weâ€™re just going
to have to get you up.

I... I...

Just lean on me.

Here.

There you go.

All right.

Be slow now.

Mm-hmm. Got you.

All right,
here we go.

Your feet
are on the floor.

Yeah.

Do you mind...

Do you mind telling me

what youâ€™re
doing here again?

Well, Iâ€™m just here
to help, thatâ€™s all.

Help me what, die?

In a way, yes.

Well, thatâ€™s a first.

Never had a stranger
just come to my door, and...

And try to help me die.

You done this before?

Iâ€™ve assisted
on two other hospice cases.

You... you do this
for a living?

I told you,
Iâ€™m a volunteer.

Oh. Oh, I see.

You, uh...
You volunteer

to help perfect
strangers die.

Is this... is this
some kind of custom?

You know, something I
just havenâ€™t heard about?

Oh, well.

You happen to be
a perfect example

of what hospice
is about.

Your grandson picks you up
from the nursing home

and just dumps you here,
all alone

with no one to turn to.

Uh-huh. And where was
the good lord today

when you needed help
getting to the bathroom?

( Toilet flushing )

Until we get everything
straightened out

with your grandson,

is there somebody who can
stay here with you?

Maybe somebody
from your church?

Here, Iâ€™ll help you back.

Better?

Yeah.

You know, I just
canâ€™t believe

that I even thought
about doing that

in the family China.

Talk about being sinful.

Well, relax,
itâ€™s not so sinful

to put the wrong thing
in the wrong China.

Here.

Unless youâ€™re
keeping kosher.

Unless Iâ€™m what?

Oh, nothing,
a little joke.

Okay, now Iâ€™m going
to fix up

that soup I promised.

Hope youâ€™re hungry.

I am a little.

Iâ€™m just going
to find something
to put it in.

Okay.

Oh, honey,
Iâ€™ve got an idea.

Iâ€™m worried about her, Gloria.

Didnâ€™t touch her supper.

Said she might eat
an egg in the morning.

I left at 6:00 and her grandson
still hadnâ€™t come back.

But she says he works late.

( Sighs )

Winnie called.

We canâ€™t go back there
after tomorrow

if she keeps refusing to sign
this hospice agreement.

I went over it with her
a dozen different ways.

"Iâ€™m not signing nothing"
is all she kept saying.

Let me take the morning shift.

See what I can do.

( Chickens clucking )

Shoo!

Shoo!

Mrs. Stiles?

Shoo!

Mrs. Stiles, itâ€™s Gloria.

Great.

Itâ€™s Gloria,
Mrs. Stiles.

Can I come in?

( Squawks )

Iâ€™m coming in.

Hi.

Good morning.

How are you?

Good morning.

There are chickens
all over your front porch.

Yeah. I usually
feed them

this time of morning.

Royâ€™s been doing it for me.

Uh-huh, huh. There.

May I ask just what it is
youâ€™re doing here?

Oh. Well, you told Rosemary

that you might eat an egg
this morning

so I dropped by
to fix it for you.

Oh, sure. You drove 20 miles
up the mountain to drop by?

Mrs. Stiles, itâ€™s damp in here.

What can we do to warm you up?

Do you have
a thermostat?

No. I just use the stove.

Stove?

Oh, the stove.

( Chuckles )

Look at this.

Huh. Where is Roy?

You told Rosemary he was going
to stay with you last night?

Roy was here.

He was here till 8:00 or later.

Thatâ€™s when I closed my eyes,
I pretended to go to sleep.

You pretended to go to sleep?

So he would go home.

Roy has better things to do
than baby-sit a sick old woman.

Oh.

Now, listen, honey.

I feel much stronger today.

Iâ€™ve been up already
and I donâ€™t need any help.

I think you should just,
you know, go on

and just get on
with your day.

I will...
as soon as I get you fed.

I suppose
you cook on this thing.

Listen, I donâ€™t know how
to say this much plainer.

Not to worry, Mrs. Stiles.
Iâ€™m no novice

at building fires.

The fire goes in here, right?

Thatâ€™s the oven, child.

Shoo! Shoo!

Shoo.

Mrs. Stiles...

Are you sure you donâ€™t
have something here

we could just plug in?

Donâ€™t like my food
cooked with electricity.

It tastes funny.

Good god, weâ€™re just going
to have a boiled egg.

I donâ€™t see
what difference it makes

how you get the water to boil.

Glorie, you have acquired
a very unpleasant habit

of using
the lordâ€™s name in vain.

Oh, you mean "good god"?

Itâ€™s just as easy to say "good
heavens" or... "Good gravy.

"Good gravy."

I will try to remember that.

And... my name is "Gloria."

Glori-a.

All right, Iâ€™ll try
to remember that.

How you
doing, boss?

( Match scratching stovetop )

( Chickens clucking )

( Groans )

All right,
I can do this.

Are you sure
this thing is safe?

Yeah. Just put the lid
back on top.

I knew that.

And close
the front door.

The chickens

are coming in.

Chickens...

Come on.

Come on!
Okay, out!

Ah.

Out you go.

Phew-shoo!

I have black all over my hands.

How does this thing work?

Itâ€™s got a handle
and a spout.

How do you think it works?

Well, humor me, Mrs. Stiles.

Iâ€™m not a morning person.

Oh, honey!

Honey, the stove.

( Gasps )
The stove!

I thought you said
this thing was safe.

It is. Itâ€™s just the damper.

Wha... I canâ€™t...

I canâ€™t even use the phone
to call anybody.

It doesnâ€™t work.

And by the time I pump
enough water by hand...

Iâ€™m going to get you
out of here.

What are you doing?

Open the damper.

Weâ€™re going outside.

Get away from me.

Stop that.
Weâ€™re going out.

Go over there
and open that damper!

Look, look, you see
that metal thing

sticking out of that pipe
right above the stove?

Go turn it.
Why?

Because weâ€™re
going to...

Choke to death
on-on the smoke.

( Groans )

Here goes.

( Loud hiss and rattle )

Oh! Aah!

Well!

Iâ€™m sorry, Mrs. Stiles.

Sometimes, good gravy
just doesnâ€™t cut it.

Open the window.

Good heavens,
I donâ€™t think

I ever met anybody
quite as-as...

Civilized?

That isnâ€™t the word
I was reaching for

but it-itâ€™ll have to do.

( Clanking )

All right.

Put a lid on that; The water

will boil faster.

Now I know
why you country people

eat such hearty breakfasts.

Itâ€™s a dayâ€™s work
just to boil an egg.

Well, donâ€™t just stand there

watching it.

Why not?

A watched pot never boils.

Since when?

Just take
my word for it.

You want to
get the eggs?

Theyâ€™re on
the counter

over there
by the window.

Roy gathered them
last night.

Oh, yuck!

Mrs. Stiles,
these eggs...

Theyâ€™re covered in...

Bird... stuff.

Well, then, wash them off.

Whatâ€™s that smoke?

Man:
God, look
at that!

Man: Letâ€™s go.
Check it out.
Letâ€™s go.

You know, I think this would
be a whole lot easier

if you got in bed and I got up

and made you breakfast.
( Banging )

( Gasps )
Whatâ€™s going on?

What are you two
doing here?

What are you doing here?

Mr. Anders, sir...

That placeâ€™s on fire.

No, no, itâ€™s not.

Itâ€™s probably
just the stove.

Whoâ€™s this?

Iâ€™m Roy stiles.

This is my wife
Charlene.

This was
my grandmaâ€™s farm.

False alarm,
Mr. Anders.

Thereâ€™s no fire.

A couple ladies
in there trying

to boil an egg.

What?!

Gloria:
Wait a minute.

I want to talk with
whoeverâ€™s in charge out here.

Would that be you?

Lady, I donâ€™t know who you are

but you are trespassing
on private property.

If you and whoever else

you got inside there
donâ€™t get going

in one minute,
Iâ€™m calling the sheriff.

Iâ€™m Gloria greenwood,
a hospice volunteer

caring for an elderly woman
inside

who happens
to be terminally ill.

Iâ€™m trying
to tell you,
Mr. Anders

my grandma, sheâ€™s moved
back into the cottage.

She canâ€™t do that!

Well, she has!

So if you and your neanderthals

donâ€™t get away from this cottage
in less than a minute

Iâ€™m going to call the sheriff.

Donâ€™t you touch my orchard!

Donâ€™t you get too comfortable

in there,
Mrs. Stiles!

Youâ€™re not staying long.

Well, it boiled.

One of the lordâ€™s
little miracles.

I can do that.

Oh. Uh,
two minutes?

Well, better
make it three.

Three.

Oh, uh, glori-a...

Uh, meet Charlene.

This is
Royâ€™s wife.

Youâ€™re not from
around here, are you?

Iâ€™m from New York.

Uh, but I live
here now.

Hmm.

Well, Roy would
just have loved

to see New York,
wouldnâ€™t you, honey?

I mean, he just got an itch
in his britches.

Just wants to travel

around the world.

Grandma.

Honey, I surely wanted

to leave you this land,

and I wouldâ€™ve
if your daddy and me

just could have died easy.

Charlene:
But since youâ€™ve
just sold the farm

surely there must have
been some profit.

No, Charlene,
there wasnâ€™t!

Okay? Not a penny...

By the time
I got finished

paying off the back taxes

the rest
of the farmâ€™s debt

the mountain
of medical bills

from my dad
and now my grandmaâ€™s bills

on top of that.

But we arenâ€™t
leaving any debts, Roy.

Not many farmers
can say that.

Iâ€™ll be waiting in the car, Roy.

Hmm...

( Clears throat )

Iâ€™m curious about
this Anders guy.

I wonder if I could talk
with the lawyer

you used to, uh,
sell the property.

I didnâ€™t have one.

You didnâ€™t have a lawyer?

No. The fella down at the bank,
he took care

of everything.

Oh, what about
your contract?

The one you signed?

You did read it, didnâ€™t you?

What is it, Mrs. Stiles?

You can read, canâ€™t you?

My not being able to readâ€™s got
nothing to do with anything.

And Iâ€™m not ignorant,
if thatâ€™s what you think.

I ran this farm
after my husband died

and my being able to read

or not able to read

never mattered none.

( Softly ):
Okay.

Mrs. Greenwood,
our personal lives

are really none
of your business.

Now, the farm is gone
and thatâ€™s that.

Now, I came here today
to try and talk my grandma

into going back
to the nursing home.

No, Roy, I canâ€™t do it.

Grandma, would you look
out there?

It is like a war zone.

This Anders,
heâ€™s going to come here

with the sheriff
and the state police

and heâ€™s going
to drag you
out of here.

It doesnâ€™t have
to be that way, Roy.

We can stop him.

Roy:
I donâ€™t want
to stop him!

Canâ€™t you get that
through your head?!

Honey, the fridge we ordered
wonâ€™t fit

so we either have to exchange it
for a smaller one

or move the
kitchen wall.

She sold
a 250-acre farm

and didnâ€™t even have
an attorney

to look at the contract.

Whatâ€™s it
going to be?

The wall or
the fridge?

Poor woman
canâ€™t even read.

Smaller fridge. Okay.

Youâ€™re not listening
to me.

No, honey. You see,
youâ€™re not listening to me.

Iâ€™m supposed to be
in court right now

helping Philn
in the Hillborough case

but our contractor here
has 50 urgent questions

and you canâ€™t be found.

Iâ€™ve been out

with Mrs. Stiles.
You know that.

Mrs. Stiles is not your problem.

This is your problem.

She happens to be my patient.

Not according
to Winnie Bradley, who left

two rather
terse messages
on the machine.

Something about
some unsigned
hospice forms?

There are bulldozers crawling
all over her property.

The fumes,
the filth, the noise...

Mrs. Stiles hasnâ€™t been able
to sleep, to eat.

What theyâ€™re doing out there
canâ€™t be legal.

What you are
doing out there

is definitely
not legal.

( Sighing ):
Honey...

David... wait.

Iâ€™m asking you for help.

How often does
that happen?

Look, just please look
into it for me, all right?

Make sure the
contractâ€™s good.

Please?

Please?

There is a standard
legal paragraph

in cases like this
which entitles the seller

to quiet possession
and peaceful enjoyment

for a reasonable period.

Mm-ah! I knew I
could count on you.

Iâ€™m going to call
that contractor

right away.

Oh, uh, about the kitchen...
move the wall.

Move the wall.

Oh, and you wonâ€™t forget

about this
evening, right?

This evening?

My reception?

Country club?

Being sworn in
as a member

of the state bar?

Country club. Of course
Iâ€™ll be there, but

we wonâ€™t stay

too late, will we?

I have to get up early
in the morning.

Gloria?

Yeah?

Honey, you havenâ€™t even tried
to make any friends at the club.

Honey, I told you those people

just donâ€™t interest me
right now.

And why is that?

Because they donâ€™t have

one foot in
the grave?

Hey... come here.

Look...

Ever since last year

nothing seems
to interest you

but death... not me,
not our marriage...

Our lives.

Hi.

Hi.

( Sighing )

You been here all morning?

Yes. Gloria, we need
to talk about this.

Oh, I know. I spoke
to Winnie on the way out here.

She will not sign
the hospice agreement.

We canâ€™t stay here.

What are we supposed to do?

Abandon her?

We have no choice.

Mrs. Stiles, why did
you tell Rosemary

you donâ€™t want a
hospice team here?

Because I donâ€™t.

Well, then Iâ€™m going
to have to leave, too.

Well, thatâ€™s up to you, I guess.

Donâ€™t worry.

The doctor said I would have
good days and bad days.

Iâ€™ll be just fine.

Look, this is a telephone.

No.

Please. If you
want any help

or you just want to
talk about anything

please, push
the green button

and youâ€™ll reach
me, all right?

I donâ€™t think that
will be necessary.

Itâ€™ll make me feel
much better. Please.

Are you sure I canâ€™t make you

something to eat
before I go?

Donâ€™t want nothing.

But, you know,
while youâ€™re feeling

so helpful
and all

it would be awful nice if...

If you could take me
down to the church.

The church you stopped
going to 40 years ago?

Thereâ€™s somebody down there
Iâ€™d like to see.

J.P. Conklin.

He come in when our
old pastor got sick.

Boy, was he good-looking.

Really?

Made me feel like a lump
of lard on a hot skillet.

Only man in my whole life

ever said out loud
I was pretty.

Mrs. Stiles,
that is so sweet.

Nothing sweet about it.

Turn left right up there.

You could come in
if you wanted to.

Iâ€™ll wait
out here for you.

Donâ€™t you think, uh...?

Well, maybe you
should get on home.

You know, youâ€™ve
done enough already.

And, uh, I know
you must have family

that needs taking care of
or... a job.

I had a job...
in New York.

I was with a national
consulting firm.

We fixed businesses.

You know, big corporations
who get fiscally sick...

and weâ€™d go in
and revive them.

Revive them?

Mm-hmm. Weâ€™d save them.

Oh... so youâ€™ve got a...

Youâ€™ve got a history
of saving things.

What I want to say is,

in addition to
the hospice work,

I could help you
get your legal
affairs in order.

Glorie, thereâ€™s something

I havenâ€™t quite figured out
about you...

But I will.

Man 1:
...Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll
be good at that.

Man 2:
We appreciate your
good advice, reverend.

Woman:
Yes.

Good idea.

Congratulations.

See you next Sunday.

Woman:
Next Sunday.

Grace?

Grace stiles?

As I live and breathe.

I wasnâ€™t sure youâ€™d
recognize me, John Patrick.

Of course
I recognize you...

But Iâ€™m flabbergasted
youâ€™re actually here.

Well, it wasnâ€™t anything
I planned, believe me.

I havenâ€™t thought about
you in a million years.

Iâ€™m very glad to see you.

Me, too.

How have
you been, grace?

Just fine.

The guidelines
in the hospice handbook

clearly state that...

I understand

every detail
of the handbook

and it all worked fine
for patients like

Mr. Saunders
and Mr. Barnes

but grace stiles isnâ€™t
dying by the book.

No one does, Gloria.

And no matter what, we try
to train our volunteers

not to become
emotionally involved.

I couldnâ€™t help it.

I love that woman.

And if her faith is giving her
the strength she needs

to get through this
without painkillers

who am I to tell her
differently?

I understand
that my going out there

is putting hospice in jeopardy.

Thatâ€™s why I thought
it best to resign.

( Sighs )

We need you too much.

Grace does, too.

Go and do what you must.

Weâ€™ll, uh... weâ€™ll find
a way to support you.

Oh... thank you.

Look here. I got
the sleeves done.

Now all I have to do
is the top.

This is beautiful.

Itâ€™s a work of art.

Well, it looks
just like the...

The orchard.

Yeah, I thought itâ€™d be nice

if luanne could just see
what it looks like.

Whoâ€™s luanne?

Luanne, my great niece.

Thatâ€™s her picture right there.

She and Roy
are the only ones of my kin

that still bother with me.

Sheâ€™s my youngest
older brotherâ€™s

middle sonâ€™s first daughterâ€™s
third child.

By her second marriage.

Oh. Well...

Who can compete
with that?

( Laughing )

Oh, look
in the wicker basket there.

Right at the foot
of the bed.

Well, somebody likes
to write letters.

Me and luanne, we have
a real close connection.

Sheâ€™s going
to be 13 this month.

I thought Iâ€™d put
this in a box

and have Roy
mail it to her.

You donâ€™t think
heâ€™ll forget, do you?

Men are... men are careless

about such things.

Iâ€™ll mail it for you.

Would you?

Iâ€™ll have Roy give you
the address and...

And money for the postage...

And... I thank you.

( Sighing )

( Humming "the church
in the Wildwood" )

You want me to find you
something to do? Hmm?

Oh, Iâ€™m fine.

But youâ€™re just standing there.

Iâ€™m thinking.

Yeah, well,
thinking isnâ€™t doing.

"Thinking" is just a fancy word
for idleness

and we all know that idleness
is the devilâ€™s workshop.

Mrs. Stiles

I donâ€™t believe in the devil.

( Laughing )

You think he cares about that?

And whatâ€™s that picking
at your fingers youâ€™re doing?

Well, because,
in the last few days

I have managed to tear up
every one of my nails.

Every one.

Oh. Well, you just go on home
and sit in your fancy bathtub

and let your fingernails
grow back.

Iâ€™m going to find
something to do.

Thereâ€™s a bag in there
under the table

with scraps of fabric.

I donâ€™t know
how to sew.

Nobody said sewing.

Itâ€™s, uh... itâ€™s quilting.

Here, Iâ€™ll show you.

Iâ€™ll bring it
in to you.

No. No. Iâ€™m having a...
Real good day.

Youâ€™re supposed
to keep moving.

Ask me, you think too much.

No garden in this world
ever got planted

by thinking about it.

Yes, Mrs. Stiles.

And you donâ€™t use
that tone with me.

Iâ€™m not your mother.

All right. Now, you take
this piece of cardboard.

Just put it
on top of your fabric

and cut around it.

Okay?

All right.

Howâ€™s that?

Work oâ€™ art.

Do another one, glorie.

Mrs. Stiles,
my name isnâ€™t glorie.

Itâ€™s... itâ€™s Gloria.

Well, my name isnâ€™t
Mrs. Stiles, either.

Itâ€™s grace.

Come on.

I want to show you something.

That picture there...
thatâ€™s Mr. Stiles, my husband.

Them others,
thatâ€™s my kids.

Thatâ€™s right.

You have four children.

Where are they now?

Iâ€™m sorry. Was that
a personal question?

No. Thatâ€™s all right.

Iâ€™ll... Iâ€™ll show you
where they are.

Thatâ€™s my husband.

Those are my kids
down there.

You lost all four
of your children?

Yep.

Ronnie...

he was the baby.

I went in to him
one morning.

He wasnâ€™t breathing.

Doctor come.

He said these things
just happen.

Duane... he was hunting
with his daddy.

Stumbled over
some barbed wire in the snow.

Gun went off.

Colin?

Vietnamese war.

Really the only one that
had a chance to grow up

was Roger Lee.

Heâ€™s Royâ€™s daddy.

How did you deal with that?

Losing them, I mean.

I grieved.

I still do.

But it was the
good lordâ€™s will.

You didnâ€™t question that?

The good lordâ€™s will?

Gloria, what
happened to you?

Tell me about
your children.

Pardon me?

You said you was in labor.

We had a son.

His name was Billy.

He was, uh, killed
in an automobile accident

over a year ago.

( Sighing )

You poor thing.

Why do young people think

they have to drive so
fast nowadays anyway?

He was eight years old, grace.

He wasnâ€™t driving.

I was.

Howâ€™s your hip?

Oh!

Feel all right?

Yeah, hipâ€™s wonderful.

You tell me why...

Why part of my bodyâ€™s
getting better

and the other partâ€™s
dying.

Weeds.

You know, when they
plant me here,

Iâ€™m going to work on them

from underneath.

Just going
to pull them down.

Itâ€™s getting cold.

( Groaning )

Oh, grace. Grace...

You hurt so much.

Shh. Donâ€™t move, donâ€™t move.

Just let me hold you.

( Gasping )

Will you look at those trees?

Hasnâ€™t been an artist born

paint a pretty picture as that.

( Rooster crowing )

Listen.

I donâ€™t hear
anything.

Yeah, and thatâ€™s
the first day this week

that them fool machines
have been quiet.

I sure would
like to know

how you
got them to stop.

Well, Gloria asked me
to find a judge

that would agree
that a sick woman

shouldnâ€™t be subjected
to bulldozers

and chainsaws
and dynamite, so...

I did.

Well, you-you lawyers
are something.

Look just like
regular people, too.

David, quit
stuffing your face

for one minute and
tell us what happened
at the meeting.

How did it go?

I think Mr. Andersâ€™
blood pressure

went up about
a hundred points.
Good.

Thatâ€™s not all weâ€™ll do
to that swindler.

What Anders did
was technically legal.

It may not have been

the most benevolent
thing in the world.

Benevolent? He used
a 1978 tax appraisal

to value graceâ€™s
property today.

Which is technically legal.

But itâ€™s not right.

Grace had to ask
for an updated assessment.

How was she
to even know
about that?

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

You two always snap
at each other like this?

Not always.

Anyway, I told Anders
weâ€™d sue if necessary.

Grace:
To sue?

Oh, now, just a minute.

I didnâ€™t want to die
in that nursing home

and I for sure donâ€™t want
to die in no courtroom.

Nobodyâ€™s going
to court, grace.

Donâ€™t worry.

Heâ€™ll come around
to a nice quiet settlement.

Whatâ€™s that supposed
to mean?

It means
the difference

of what this land was worth

and what you sold it for.

With current land values,
we got to be talking...

$160,000... minimum.

$160,000?

Thatâ€™s the upside.

There is a downside.

This could take a while.

Grace, youâ€™re going
to need a will.

And here is a standard
legal form.

Okay, all
we have to do

is fill in a few
of these blanks.

What am I going to do
with all that money?

Leave it to anyone
you want.

Roy?

Roy? Heâ€™d just get in trouble.

Thereâ€™s luanne.

Grace has a favorite niece
in Providence.

Letâ€™s start a trust
to pay for her college.

A trust.
David, thatâ€™s a great idea.

Do you know what the Bible
says about money?

Itâ€™s the root of all evil.

I donâ€™t want that
on my conscience.

Letâ€™s just forget about this.

Grace...

No! No! No!

No wills,
no lawsuits

no nothing.

I got to go.

I have a client meeting.

I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s
happening to me.

Iâ€™m so confused.

Iâ€™m sorry. Weâ€™re putting you
through too much.

No, Iâ€™m an old lady
and Iâ€™m set in my ways.

I know that.

But I just canâ€™t stand
surprises.

Thatâ€™s why I got upset.

But I surely didnâ€™t mean
to hurt your feelings.

Itâ€™s fine.

Letâ€™s just forget it.

Here, Iâ€™ll help
you wash those.

Iâ€™m fine.

Well, all right,
then you wash
and Iâ€™ll dry.

Okay.

Are you sure you wonâ€™t
eat something?

Well, I was looking
out the window

at my orchard
up there.

And I was thinking

I would love
to have a bite

out of one
of them apples.

You would?
Yeah.

Well, then what
are we waiting for?

Letâ€™s go.

Would you show me

the big house, too?

Grace:
All right.

I havenâ€™t been there myself
since the hospital.

Gloria:
Watch your step.

There we go.

Grace:
Okay, okay, fine.

Oh!

( Chuckles )

Well, I never did
like it much anyway.

You should have
seen it before.

It always had
a lot of fishing gear

and guns.

You know, menâ€™s stuff.

Nothing of mine.

The orchard, though,
that was different.

I used to go out there
every day.

Iâ€™d take a blanket
in the afternoon

and Iâ€™d lie down on my back

when my work was done.

Thatâ€™s where
Iâ€™d dream my dreams.

Oh, look there.

Thatâ€™s a gala.

Thatâ€™s one of my favorites.

Thatâ€™s the first morsel
Iâ€™ve seen you eat in days.

Mm.

Hmm?

Donâ€™t want any more.

You only had
one bite.

I know. You finish it.

Can you see the steeple

of your little church
from here?

That is not my church.

Gloria:
Thatâ€™s right.
You mentioned that.

Could you tell me
about the reverend?

He was just a young man.

You know, young preacher.

John Patrick Conklin.

I was married, of course.

One day in Sunday school,
he asked me to stand up

and read something
out of the Bible.

Everybody laughed.

They knew I couldnâ€™t read.

But later, he said
I shouldnâ€™t feel bad...

that heâ€™d teach me how.

That poor thing.

Iâ€™d go down there

on Sunday afternoons
with my book.

I couldnâ€™t concentrate.

I just liked
watching his eyes.

The way heâ€™d get
his brows all worried

when I messed up.

And I liked listening
to him laugh, you know.

Then the people
from the church...

my mother-in-law especially

started cackling like
a bunch of old hens.

My husband heard about it

and he stormed down there
and cussed him out.

Why?

Did anything happen?

Course nothing happened.

I was so mad

I just never
went back there.

Took me a long time
to get over

being angry with god.

But then, through the years,
I came to realize

that Mr. Stiles really
did love me in his way.

He stood by me
through a heap of trouble.

My husband...

He stood by me
through a heap
of trouble, too.

( Sighs )

New York...

that was my orchard.

Especially
the last few years.

I had just
gotten promoted.

I was the head of
an entire division.

I finally...

Achieved, as
a woman, respect.

Even more than the power
or the money, you know?

And then your
little boy died.

What was his name?

Billy?

Yeah.

Iâ€™ll bet he was smart.

And talented.

He, uh... he liked
to draw pictures.

Thatâ€™s all right, honey.

Thatâ€™s all right.

Just let it all out.

You got to make room
inside yourself again

for happiness.

Oh, grace...
I loved him so.

Of course
you did, honey.

Of course you did.

( Knocking )

Hi, Roy.

Glad to see you.

Hey, grandma.

Hello, Roy.

Where you been?

Oh, you know, busy.

Well, I just
stopped by

â€™cause the mailmanâ€™s

been dropping your stuff
off at the gas station

and, uh... you got
another letter

from luanne.

Well, donâ€™t just
stand there.

You sit down
and read it to me.

( Clearing throat )

Um, Iâ€™ll be outside.

"Dear auntie grace

"I was real sad
when mom told me today

"that you are very sick.

"So I thought maybe
I could cheer you up

"and myself, too,
by writing you a happy letter.

"Whenever Iâ€™m
feeling bad

"I play with
my dog Dooley.

"Dooleyâ€™s just a mutt

"but heâ€™s always ready
to play or snuggle when I hurt.

"I wish people could be
more like Dooley.

Thatâ€™s all I can think
of right now, auntie grace."

Roy...

Roy, I want
to thank you.

Yeah, sure.

I can feel
this hostility

coming from you.

If you feel like Iâ€™m getting

between you and your grandmother

you can say so.

It makes you feel
like youâ€™re doing

something good
coming up here, doesnâ€™t it?

Probably think you care
about her more than me.

What? No.

I donâ€™t feel that way at all.

You want to know why
I donâ€™t come?

Because all I think about
when Iâ€™m up here

is my dad working like a mule

every day of his life.

For what?

Every year the farm would
just sink deeper into the hole.

But dad, he would just
push himself harder and harder.

You love your grandmother,
donâ€™t you, Roy?

What a question.

She showed me

how to toss a horseshoe...

Pitch a ball.

Dad was always

working the farm.

Grandma was, too...

But somehow she found the time.

Well, you should...

You should come back, Roy.

Show her that you appreciate
all sheâ€™s done.

Bring Charlene.

( Engine starting )

Glorie?

What are you doing here?

Iâ€™m getting
into this.

Iâ€™m getting
a lot done.

What time is it?

I donâ€™t know. 2:30?

In the morning?

Yeah.

Why arenâ€™t you home
with your husband

where you belong?

Oh, Davidâ€™s probably
not home himself.

Itâ€™s Friday night.

Heâ€™s probably out with the boys.

I still want you to go home.

And your husband...

Heâ€™s not out with the boys
and you know it.

Iâ€™ve seen him looking at you,
just aching for you.

Now, you just take
your things

and you go on home.

Itâ€™s not right, a young woman
messing with death like this.

I want to know about death.

You know about death.

You just donâ€™t accept it yet.

Your boy died

and itâ€™s like the doctor said.

"These things happen"?

Yes.

Just happen?
No rhyme or reason?

How should I know
what the reason is?

You just take each day
as itâ€™s given you.

You donâ€™t question.

No questions?

No.

What shall I do then, huh?

Just keep busy
for the next 50 years?!

Something happens like this,
you start over.

Oh, yeah,
start over.

Move to a new town...

that was Davidâ€™s answer.

Have another baby.

Look how many children
you buried.

Are you telling me that
I can go through this again?

Listen, child, you either
do a thing or you donâ€™t.

What other choices
do we have?

Oh, Iâ€™ve got choices.

Like what?

Oh.

Thatâ€™s what this is about.

Youâ€™re here trying on death
for size

before you go out
and kill yourself.

Thatâ€™s it, isnâ€™t it?

Isnâ€™t it?

It shouldnâ€™t have happened!

He was a perfect,
innocent boy

with his whole life
in front of him!

I mean, grace, you are the one
with the faith here

so you tell me...

what heavenly purpose
was served

by crushing his beautiful body

and leaving it
on my lap to die?!

I just want an answer,
you know?

Just one lousy reason!

Glorie.

Glorie, would you do me a favor?

Would you let me go first?

Well, I wasnâ€™t sure
Iâ€™d ever see you back.

Grace, about last night.

Iâ€™m sorry, I...

I get freaky
when I get too tired

and I, I shouldnâ€™t have

and I apologize.

I brought us something.

If youâ€™re feeling up to it,

I thought maybe we could...

Whereâ€™s a good place we can go
to just laze out?

"Laze out"?

Heh. I donâ€™t think
I ever done that before.

Whatâ€™d you go
buy food for?

If thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve
got plenty of, itâ€™s food.

Well, I know
itâ€™s a stretch,

but I thought
something exotic

might tempt you to eat,

so everything I brought
today is imported.

All right.

Now, I want you

to try this.

What is it?

Itâ€™s prosciutto

on a sliver
of raisin pumpernickel.

Pro what?

Prosciutto.
Itâ€™s a kind of ham.

What kind of ham?

Itâ€™s Italian.

You bought eye-talian ham?

Well, itâ€™s meat.

Try it.

Meat? Why didnâ€™t
you tell me?

We could have gone

and killed us one
of them chickens.

Grace, please.

You donâ€™t eat chicken?

Well, not ones
Iâ€™ve made eye contact with.

Um...

Here, youâ€™re going
to like this.

Itâ€™s cheese.

I got a three-pound
carton of cheese

in my frigerator.

Not like this.

This is special.

Itâ€™s called brie.

Smell it.

Isnâ€™t that heaven?

Phew.

I sure hope not.

Okay.

( Humming )

Whatâ€™s that?

Iâ€™m not telling.

Iâ€™m just going to eat it.

( Humming )

Mmm. Mmm!

This is delicious.

Itâ€™s lobster salad.

Oh, I seen pictures
of lobsters.

Mm-hmm.

With all them legs

and them beady little eyes.

Donâ€™t, grace.

They look just like
please...

Great big bugs.

( Suppressed laugh )

Okay.

So, we done lazing out?

Mm-hmm.

There it is.

Got it all done.

Grace, it is
breathtaking.

I sure wish I
could show luanne
how I did it.

Well, you can.

Look.

I brought this
with me today

and Iâ€™ve been
meaning to ask you

I want to videotape you.

For luanne.

This is perfect.

While sheâ€™s trying on
the sweater

you could be there
explaining about the orchard.

I donâ€™t think so, no.
Why not?

Sheâ€™ll Cherish it
the rest of her life.

Sheâ€™ll finally get to see
this amazing aunt

sheâ€™s written
all these letters to.

Yeah. You want luanne to see me?

The way I look?

Grace, you are beautiful.

Beautiful?

I look like something that y-you

find out on the highway.

Whatâ€™s that Roy calls it?

Roadkill.

Weâ€™ll make you feel pretty.

Weâ€™ll doll you up.

Put on a little makeup
and make your hair look nice.

You want luanne
to see a painted woman?

Makeup is about accenting
and highlighting

the beauty
that is already there.

You wearing makeup now?

See, you canâ€™t even tell.

Well...

I mean, if by some miracle
you could make me look...

Just halfway presentable.

Whatâ€™d I say then?

Well, youâ€™d start out
by wishing her a happy birthday.

Well, I can do that with a card.

( Men shouting )

Oh, theyâ€™re starting
them machines again.

But they canâ€™t.
Thereâ€™s a court order.

Theyâ€™re doing
it, though.

Yeah, theyâ€™re moving.

Theyâ€™re moving right out.
They...

Where they going?

No!

No!

The orchard?

Grace.

No! Stop!

Grace, please.

Stop!

Letâ€™s go back inside.

This wonâ€™t help.

No!

No! Please, stop! Please.

Please.

Donâ€™t do this.

No!

No!

Grace, letâ€™s go back in.

Come on.

Grace.

Grace.

Theyâ€™re killing my trees.

Stop.

I wish I could.

Oh, grace.

I rinsed everything out.

I donâ€™t think
the stains will set.

( Wheezing )

Iâ€™m calling Dr. Peters.

Donâ€™t do anything.

Grace.

You were throwing up blood.

Honey, you didnâ€™t come here

to help me pull through this.

You came to help me die.

You think Iâ€™m a fool, donâ€™t you?

Carrying on
about a bunch of trees.

No, of course not.

I-I understand they had

sentimental value.

Theyâ€™re just old,
majestic trees.

That developer,
he was sending us a message.

You know it.

I just hope
you donâ€™t let him

get away with this.

Now weâ€™re back
to lawsuits again.

You deserved a fair price
for this farm.

Itâ€™s not just
the money, grace.

Itâ€™s what the money
can buy you.

Youâ€™ve got a chance here

to give luanne
what you never had.

Opportunities.

Education.

Freedom, grace.

Freedom to grow
and blossom as she pleases.

All you have to do
is sign the will.

Stop helping me, honey.

I really donâ€™t
feel very good.

Okay.

( Coughing )

Glorie?

Glorie!

Oh.

Oh! Okay, letâ€™s do it.

You paint me.

Where do you
want me to go?

Over there
by that table, or...?

Maybe... maybeâ€™d be better
by the windows.

Thereâ€™s more light.

What are you
talking about?

Well, y-you, you said you
was going to doll me up

so I could talk to luanne.

Okay.

All right.

Whatâ€™s the matter
with you?

Nothing.

Grace, youâ€™ve been asleep
for the last 18 hours.

Really?

What you doing now?

Iâ€™m softening
your cheekbones.

See if you
can fix my nose.

Okay, look over my
shoulder. Right here

and donâ€™t blink.

How am I supposed
to do that?

Well, concentrate.
Concentrate.

Iâ€™m concentrating.

Okay.

There.

All right. What shall
we do with your hair?

Well...

I guess we could throw
one of them quilts over it.

Whatâ€™s that?

Thought weâ€™d do
something different.

Looks like... like egg whites
all whipped up.

I think thatâ€™s
what this is.

Well, thatâ€™s different,
all right.

I could live to be a hundred

and never think
of wearing a meringue.

No peeking.

All right.

Okay.

You can open
your eyes.

Well, that preacher was right.

I was good-looking.

You still are, grace.

You ready to talk
to luanne now?

What? Iâ€™m just looking
in the mirror here.

( Groans )

Oh, grace.

You want to lay
down, huh?

No, it-itâ€™ll go away
in just a minute.

You sure you want
to do this today?

We donâ€™t have to.

Yeah. Iâ€™m fine now.

Yeah, if you...

If you think Iâ€™m going through
the mascara and meringue again

youâ€™ve got another think coming.

All right, I got you.

Come on.

Okay, all you have to do
is relax...

Think about what
you want to say.

Look at the camera.

Pretend the cameraâ€™s luanne.

I canâ€™t pretend
a machineâ€™s a person.

Okay, uh...

Pretend Iâ€™m luanne.

All right.

Okay.

Relax.

Hello, luanne.

This is your great-aunt...

Just regular.

I canâ€™t do this.

I just canâ€™t think
of anything to say.

Iâ€™m sorry. I just...

Letâ€™s wish her a happy birthday

and, uh... letâ€™s
show her the sweater.

She can see this, too?

Sure.

All right.

Okay. Iâ€™m going to start over.

Just relax.

Thatâ€™s it.

Hello, luanne.

This is your great-aunt grace

and I-I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday

and I wanted to tell you, too

how much those letters
that you wrote me

you know, meant to me.

And the pictures...
I really did love the pictures.

Iâ€™m just glad
youâ€™re thinking of me.

Iâ€™ve been thinking
of you, too

especially when I
was knitting this.

Can you see that?

Thatâ€™s the orchard
that used to be here.

I thought you might like
to see a picture of it.

I sure would
like to see you.

Iâ€™d just... give you a hug.

I hope youâ€™re not
too big for hugs.

Roy stiles.

Where have you been?

Oh, my...

Is this who I think it is?

Luanne?

I bet this
is Dooley.

Hi.

Wow. Where did she come from?

I drove down to Providence
and got her.

Come on.

I-I know I should be
giving you some advice

because thatâ€™s what-what people
expect old people to do

is to offer some advice

but, honestly, you
young women today

are-are so bright
an-and independent

I just, I just donâ€™t
know what to tell you.

I donâ€™t even know
what I know.

( Laughing )

Merciful heaven.

Are my eyes
playing tricks on me?

Hello, aunt grace.

Whatâ€™s going on here?

Why, this is a miracle.

This is a positive miracle.

Well, Roy is
the miracle worker.

He went all the way
to Providence to get her.

Oh, Roy.

You are something else.

Letâ€™s take a look
at you, honey.

Oh, you are so big.

Beautiful and so...

Good gravy, I forgot I
had on these red lips.

I donâ€™t usually wear all this
stuff all over my face.

You-you you tell her, glorie.

Donâ€™t believe a word she says.

Sheâ€™s the local Cleopatra.

Oh.

Oh.

Gosh, honey...

Iâ€™m just so happy
to see you.

That I just...

I donâ€™t even know
how to express it.

Roy.

Thank you, honey.

Thank you.

Here I am,
just crying like a fool.

Thank you
for giving me luanne

and, luanne, I have
something for you.

I made this and...

And this is my orchard

you know,
before they knocked it down.

I wish you
could have seen it

but, anyway, here it is.

Thatâ€™s for you.

Thank you.

You know, Roy,
glorie said

that she didnâ€™t think
that-that the developer

had paid us
a rightful price for our farm.

So, sheâ€™s going to get
some more money from him.

Gloria:
Have you given any thought

to how youâ€™d like
the money used, grace?

Yes, I have.

Iâ€™ve thought about it
and Iâ€™ve prayed about it

and, Roy, you should
have half

and, luanne, you have
the other half.

Oh, thank you,
aunt grace.

Youâ€™re welcome,
honey.

Itâ€™s for your
college education.

Itâ€™s so you can-can... oh.

How did you say that?

Grow and blossom.

Yeah, grow and blossom
as you wish.

( Dog barks )

Oh, merciful heavens.

Is that who I think it is?

Come on in.

Come on, Dooley.

Oh, yeah.

Well, Mr. Attorney?

Is that as legal
as a written will?

That should hold up
in any court in the land.

( Knocking )

Hi.
Hi.

You started the
slumber party
without me?

Look, aunt grace
hand-embroidered
this nightshirt.

Isnâ€™t it so pretty?

You did?

Where do you get
the time?

Music.
( Country music playing )

I did a nightshirt
for you, too.

Itâ€™s right there.

For me?

( Chuckling )

â™ª ...turning all around â™ª

â™ª all the world seemed
to be standing still... â™ª

Here.

Okay.

This... belonged
to your son?

Mm-hmm.

Hold it up to
the candlelight.

( Gasps )

Wow...

Itâ€™s... beautiful.

Yes.

Billy would gaze into that
for the longest time

and then heâ€™d draw
what he saw with
his colored pencils.

Night.

Good night,
sweetheart.

I love you.

You, too.

( Yawning )

Time for you
to go to sleep, too.

Glorie, would you
feel my legs?

Do they feel
cold to you?

No.

So, you donâ€™t...

You donâ€™t think
Iâ€™m dying just yet?

No, youâ€™re not dying
just yet.

You think if I go to sleep
Iâ€™ll wake up?

Youâ€™d better.

Otherwise, Iâ€™m going
to have to clean up

this mess we made
all by myself.

( Both chuckle )

Good night, honey.

Oh, youâ€™re not
going to sleep

in that uncomfortable
old chair again tonight.

( Sighs )

You-you come on over.

Come get in with me.

I canâ€™t sleep
in your bed, grace.

Well, itâ€™s a
slumber party.

Thatâ€™s what girls do.

Come on.

( Amused sigh )

Good night.

( Sighs )

This is nice.

The way you gave
luanne that toy

that belonged to
your little boy

that was nice, too.

Iâ€™ve saved a lot
of billyâ€™s things.

Itâ€™s a shame for them
to go to waste.

You know what I think?

I think that
youâ€™re ready to...

Talk about it...

About what happened
to your little boy.

It was...

Billyâ€™s first day
at the new school...

And it was raining.

So, I decided to drive over
and pick him up.

We were headed back across town.

I donâ€™t know
where it came from...

This truck.

( Sighs )

When it hit us

it crumpled billyâ€™s side
of the car like a paper bag.

( Sighing moan )

We were pinned inside the wreck
for more than an hour...

Just squeezed
into this tiny sliver of space.

Billy was on my lap...

And as I held him

I could feel his life
just slipping away...

And there was nothing
I could do...

But scream.

So, we buried him...

This gentle, sweet boy.

( Sobbing sigh )

After that...

I donâ€™t know,
I just shut down, you know?

I wouldnâ€™t go to work.

I wouldnâ€™t go outside.

What for?

There was no point.

David, he...

He dragged me
from one doctor to the next.

We ended up with a shrink
who suggested a change

somewhere far from the city.

Davidâ€™s done just about
everything he can for me.

I donâ€™t know.
Iâ€™m so lost.

I donâ€™t know what I feel...

Even about him.

( Sighs )

Itâ€™s a terrible thing
to lose a child, honey...

But donâ€™t lose a man
who loves you, too.

Luanne:
Hey, aunt grace?

Grace:
Hmm?

Think Iâ€™ll ever
be able

to make a sweater
as beautiful as this one?

Oh, yes.

Youâ€™ll just, you know,
make your own style.

Iâ€™ll bet you put Dooley
in one of them.

Good gravy.

Well, good morning.

I donâ€™t think
I ever slept so hard.

Look, aunt grace is
teaching me to knit.

Hmm?

Well, she is the best.

Yeah.

( Chickens clucking )

Such a shame
to dig up this place.

Such a pretty farm.

Yes.

Itâ€™s been my
whole world...

From the animals
to the...

Trees, flowers...

Right down to the bugs.

( Chuckles )

You know what, sweetie?

Iâ€™ve been...
Iâ€™ve been trying

to think of something
that I might tell you

and I think maybe...

Maybe itâ€™s...

Look-look out
at the world out there.

Just look how...

Everythingâ€™s connected
to everything else.

Like our sweater here.

Like the stitches
in the sweater.

Now... you donâ€™t just...

One or two stitches,
they donâ€™t...

They donâ€™t mean much

but... if you...
Cut or break

even one of the stitches,
the whole sweater falls apart.

Now, I donâ€™t know...

What my life is for, luanne.

But I do know that god
put me here for a reason

and if only itâ€™s like a stitch
in the middle of a sweater

you know, so one hand
is holding onto the stitch

that came before me

and the other handâ€™s
holding onto the stitch

that came after me...

You know, if thatâ€™s all

itâ€™s still...
Itâ€™s still important.

( Dog barking )

( Chickens clucking )

Luanne:
Here, Dooley!

Dooley...

Dooley.

Donâ€™t you scare
those chickens.

( Dog barking )

( Sighing ):
Look at her.

Isnâ€™t she beautiful?

Whoa!
( Delighted screaming )

I wish she could
have seen the orchard.

Oh... honey...

She is the orchard.

Dooley,
come here.

( Grace coughing )

( Grace hoarsely ):
Glorie.

Iâ€™m here.

Iâ€™m here.

Can I ask you something?

Hmm?

Why do you like
calling me glorie?

Oh, I canâ€™t help it.

When I was a little girl,
my motherâ€™s favorite hymn was...

"He will give me
grace and glory

and go with me
all the way."

My mama used to laugh...

Said, "well, we got
our little grace.

Now, we just got to wait
for our little glory."

She never did
get her...

But I guess I did,
didnâ€™t I?

You know, glorie...

Youâ€™re the best friend
I ever had.

( Stifled crying sigh )

Oh...

Youâ€™re mourning me
already?

Mm-hmm.

Them other two people
you helped die...

Did you mourn them, too?

I guess so.

Thatâ€™s what all this messing
with death means.

Youâ€™re afraid
if you stop grieving

that youâ€™re finally going
to have to let go

of your little boy.

I loved him so.

Of course you did...

But you know, honey...

It wasnâ€™t death
tied you two together.

It was life.

Weâ€™ll have breakfast
in a little while.

Luanneâ€™s out gathering
the eggs.

Here.

In the meantime,
have an apple.

( Chickens clucking )

How do you feel?

Any pain?

I was just...

Thinking about my will.

I wanted to put something
in it for you.

Oh...

Donâ€™t be silly.

You got some things to do.

Oh, yes.

Iâ€™ve got something to do, grace.

I know what Iâ€™ll give you.

I want you to have
Gabriellaâ€™s soup tureen.

What do you say to that?

Oh...

I would be honored.

Really?

Iâ€™m glad.

This way, youâ€™ll remember
the rest of your life

what an ornery old pea pod
I was.

( Weak chuckle )

( Soft long sigh )

( Shuddering gasp )

â™ª Now she has her grace
and glory â™ª

â™ª grace and glory â™ª

â™ª now she has her grace
and glory â™ª

â™ª grace and glory â™ª

â™ª now she has her grace
and glory â™ª

â™ª heâ€™ll go with her â™ª

â™ª with her â™ª

â™ª with her â™ª

â™ª all the way â™ª

â™ª now she has her grace
and glory â™ª

â™ª now she has
her grace and glory â™ª

â™ª now she has her grace

â™ª heâ€™ll go with her â™ª

â™ª with her all the way â™ª

â™ª now she has her grace

â™ª heâ€™ll go with her â™ª

â™ª with her all the way. â™ª
