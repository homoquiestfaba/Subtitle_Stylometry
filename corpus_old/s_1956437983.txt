<i>with hope and wonder
in my eyes.</i>

<i>Until space looked back.</i>

<i>Invader Zim,</i>

<i>evil,
alien soldier of the Irken Empire</i>

<i>sent by his diabolical masters,</i>

<i>the Almighty Tallest,</i>

<i>to infiltrate Earth</i>

<i>and prepare it for
the coming invasion.</i>

<i>Disguised as one of us,</i>

<i>he moved into my neighborhood,</i>

<i>he went to my school,</i>

<i>and with the help
of his vile mechanical servants,</i>

<i>plotted to destroy
everything we have,</i>

<i>- everything we are.</i>
[helicopter whirring]

[crowd shouting]
<i>- And then...</i>

<i>he vanished.</i>

<i>My name is Dib Membrane.</i>

I'm 12 years old.

<i>And I'm all that stands
between Zim</i>

<i>and the annihilation
of our world.</i>

[Professor Membrane reading]

Prepare your starving,
gurgling child-bellies

for the awesome eventuality

of dinner!


[oven dings]

Foodio 3000 hopes you love
what I have made.

Also, what is love?

Looks great, Dad.
I'm gonna eat that food.

[Professor Membrane]
Hold up now, daughter!

Isn't it time your brother joined us?

Oh, man, no.

Since Zim vanished,
Dib's been in his room for,

like, a million years.

I hardly recognize him anymore.

He just sits there in that chair
getting grosser...

smellier.

[Professor Membrane] He sure does,

but try to be
more understanding.

Dib's finally letting go
of his silly obsession

with aliens and ghosts

and all his other
non-scientific nonsense.

And it's not easy for him.

Imagine if you stopped believing in,
oh, video games.

Don't even joke about that, Dad.

[Foodio 3000 humming]

[Professor Membrane]
Honey, letting go of silly ideas

is just part of growing up.

Why, as a child,

I thought sharks were my friends.

[in ominous voice] I know better now.

[robotic arm whirs]

[in normal voice]
So, try to be more supportive.

He's your brother, after all.

Okay, Dad.


[floorboards creaking]

[suit chirping]

Hey, Dib!
Dad says come to dinner!


[wind whooshing]

I can't leave my post, Gaz.

Just shove the food in here.

Where's the shoving stick?

I can't shove without
the shoving stick.

so I have to wait

and watch.

No one else will.
They could never see the truth.

Why, though? Brainwashing?

Mind control?


Nobody believes me now,
but I'll make them see.

I'll expose Zim to the world,

and open humanity's eyes

to the danger they were in all along.

Even Dad, world-famous
man of science will say,

[in strange accent]
"I believe you, Dib.

I'm sorry I ever doubted you."

That's the worst
Dad impression ever,

but, Dib, let it go.

Zim's been gone a long time,

and as far as you know,
he might just be gone for good.

I'd be willing to bet
that Zim will never, ever...

Oh, wait, there he is.

[Dib screeches] It's Zim!

He's back!
And he's doing stretches!

Nobody stretches like that
unless they're warming up for evil!

This is it! The... [grunts]

moment I've been...
[grunts and crashes]

waiting for!



Dib, no. Look at you.

The world's not ready to see
what you've become.

You're hideous!

The smell!


needs me!

Take a bath first!
[suit alarm blaring]

Take... [gags]

Take a bath!

No!

[thunder crackles]

[chair creaking]

Zim!

Yes, it is I, and... Hmm?

Oh, wait, sorry.
[flies buzzing]

You'll have to move along,
hideous goblin.

I'm posing dramatically
for when the Dib shows up.

I am Dib.
What?

Ugh, ugh, ugh! Ugh!
But...

Give me a sec here.
[stammers] We know each other.

[clears throat]

[thunder claps]
I've been expecting you, Dib!

I can tell.

You set up sprinklers
and everything.

[thunder crackling on radio]

[gurgles]
You can't prove anything!

Anyhow, I...
Where have you been, Zim?

I've been monitoring
your house, the school,

that taco place
you love so much.

No, no.
GIR loves that place.

I think it's dirty.

[GIR] I ate a baby there.
He did.

What have you been up to, Zim?

Phase one
of my evil plan, human.

Phase one.

[laughs maniacally]

[GIR giggles]

Computer! Laugh with me!


[chuckling softly]

[sighs]
[device beeps]

You've been in your house

sitting in the toilet all this time?

Yes.
Like, the whole time?

That's right.

Did you have to sit in the toilet?

Do not try to understand
the ways of my people, Dib!

From the moment
my mission began

on this horrible planet,
you've been there,

haunting my every move

like a squak
in my shmoopsquizz.

A what in your huh?
Uh-huh!

And while the rest of your kind
were easily fooled,

you were able to see through

my brilliant disguise.


[screeches] Eh?
The neighbor boy's an alien!


He's normal.
Okay.

I knew if I vanished
for long enough,

you'd just watch and wait,

your neglected body
growing smelly

and useless.
[Dib whimpering]

But that was only Phase One
of my evil plan.

Well, keep watching, Dookie-Dib.

Watch helplessly as I begin...

Phase Two!

[chainsaw whirring]

Hah!
No!

I'm switching people's mail around.

That's illegal. No!

I'm reading
someone's newspaper.

I don't pay for a subscription. [laughs]

Nobody reads newspapers anymore,
but, no, stop!

Minimoose, get in on this mayhem!

[Minimoose squeaks]

That's my mom's pizza sticker.

She is crazy for pizza.

Hey, what... what are you...
Hey, that... that's...

Hey, don't... Wait.

Don't! Don't!

Don't!

[panicked stammering]


Excellent.

Me! Me!
Let me do one.

I launched that pug into space.

I thought you liked that pig.
[car alarm goes off]

Why I do that?
What's the matter, human?

Why aren't you stopping me?

Can't fight back.

Sat too long.

Chair fused to butt.

More chair than man now.

Humans are such fragile, goopy things.

No Irken would ever
become a chair.

Wait! Was that Phase Two?

Of course it was!

Probably. Uh...

You know what?
Now I'm not sure.

Either way,
you're helpless to stop me,

Chair-Dib.

So long!



Zim!

[lasers firing]
[muffled yells]


Excellent work, me.

All is going according to plan,
but there's still much to do, GIR.

Yes, sir! [shouts]

[indistinct chatter on TV]



[chuckles warmly] <i>Floopsy...</i>

[TV audience] <i>Aww.</i>

Computer?

[Computer groans] What?

Open a connection with
the Almighty Tallest,

my leaders and biggest fans.


You see, GIR, The Tallest...


[groans loudly]

The Tallest
haven't heard from me,

their greatest
and most incredible invader,

in a very long time.

They'll be sick with worry.
[GIR squeaks]

[muzak playing]

Hey, remember Invader Zim?

Who?
Zim.

Tiny?

Screamed a lot?

The guy that sends us the donuts?

No, that's Invader Jim.
He's great.

Oh, wait. Zim.

We hate him!
Yeah, that's him. [chuckles]

Remember the time
we lied and told him

we were sending him on
a secret mission to Earth,

but really we were just getting
rid of him because he's awful?


[comms officer] My Tallest,
there's an incoming transmission.

Yep, life's been pretty great

ever since
Zim vanished for good.

Anyhow, send that transmission through.

I wonder who it could ever be.

<i>It is I, Zim!</i>




<i>My Tallest, you will be overjoyed to know</i>

<i>Phase One of my most ingenious plan</i>

<i>to prepare Earth
for your arrival was a success.</i>

Zim, we thought you were dead.

<i>Could a dead Zim do this?</i>

[floor creaking]

[Minimoose and GIR chattering]

[clears throat]<i> Sirs,</i>

<i>my Earthly arch-nemesis
is now a sad chair,</i>

<i>leaving me free to complete</i>

<i>the most diabolical phase of my plan,</i>

<i>Phase Two,</i>

wherein I, uh...

Uh, uh, uh... [grunting]

Computer, put them on hold.
Oh, no.

I really can't remember
what Phase Two is.

I must have sat in that toilet too long.

Think, Zim. Think.

<i>We don't care, Zim.</i>


Wait! Computer,

play back any recordings
of me discussing Phase Two.


<i>Would you like me to record any
and all mention of Phase Two?</i>

<i>No, thank you.
Zim forgets nothing.</i>

Hmm, besides reminding me
how cool I look and sound,

that was of no help.

<i>He knows we can still see
and hear him, right?</i>

<i>I liked when he was dead.</i>

[shouts excitedly]
I remember Phase Two!

You do? Good work, GIR! Tell me.

You gonna order a million pizzas,

and then I gotta roll around
in them pizzas,

and that's the story
about how I turn into a giant pizza.

This isn't the time
for the giant pizza story, GIR.

And that will never happen!

[wails loudly]


Silence! I need to think!

Just calm down and...

Computer, did you put The Tallest on hold?

[Computer] Nope.
[screams]

[static blares]

Hmm?
Huh?

I don't think they heard anything.

Yes, they did.

I am Irk's finest Invader.

If The Tallest find out
I failed to dominate the Earth

because I forgot Phase Two,

who knows what they'll do?


[crowd jeering]

[Almighty Tallest Red] Invader Zim,

you were once our best,
most amazing Invader,

but now, you're dumb.

Also, stupid.

As punishment,
you will be stripped of your Invader rank,

re-encoded as nothing.

But you can't! I am Zim!

[Almighty Tallest Red]
Control Brains, re-encode.

[electricity crackling]

[Control Brains] Re-encoding.

It is done, My Tallest.

Zim, you will live out

the rest of your long, sad days as...

[Zim yells]

[crowd cheers]
Wait, no, never mind.


GIR, time is of the essence.

The Tallest could be here any day now...
[gasps]

...and Dib won't stay a chair forever.

Go to my scheming lab,

and bring me everything
that could be Phase Two.

Quickly!
[squeals]

[potato dings]

[inaudible shouting]

[intense rock music playing]

[playful music]

[robotic meowing]

[firecrackers popping]

[intense rock music playing]

[inaudible shouting]



Ahh.

[Zim grunts]

Useless dookie!


I need more time
to remember Phase Two.

Computer, how much longer do I have
before The Tallest arrive?

[grunts]
[Computer] Information unknown.

Unacceptable.

Access The Tallest's computers
and retrieve their flight plan.

[Computer imitating British accent]
Ooh, yes, right away, sir.


[Computer in normal accent] I get bored.

P.S. There is insufficient power
to access the flight plan.

Then find more power,
and be sneaky about it.

[metallic whirring]


Sneaking!

Sneaking!

Sneaking!

[car alarms blaring]

Sneaking!

[alarms blaring]
[people screaming]



the Irken Armada plans to conquer,

but where's Earth?

The Tallest said it was
the most important mission of all.

Computer, zoom out.



Keep zooming out
until you find out

how far The Tallest are
from Earth.

Zooming out.

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

Hurry it up.
Zooming out.

Zooming out.
<i>- VÃ¡monos!</i>

I must begin Phase Two

before Dib gets back into
annoying fighting shape.

Zooming out.

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

Hmm, I'm sure it's there,

somewhere.
Zooming out.

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

Zooming out.


I was in bad shape,
then I got too in shape,

now I'm back to normal shape.


[grunting loudly]

[cat yowls]
[game beeping]

Oh, man, Dib, not the coat.

It makes me look mysterious.

Now, step aside.

I've got a Zim to stop.

[Professor Membrane humming]

All right, test children.

These bracelets are just prototypes,

so try not to breathe or think
while the energy field is...

[Dib grunts]
What? Oh.

Behold, my boy child!

I can't remember the last time

I saw you this excited
about science.

Huh?

My new
Peace Day edition Membracelet.

Tomorrow at my big keynote event,

I reveal it to the world.

And when Peace Day comes,

the children of the Earth
will hold hands and...

Wait a minute.

The alien-hunting briefcase?

Oh, son.

Not this nonsense again.

Dad, trying to save the Earth
from Zim's alien evil

is not nonsense.

Without me, there might not be
an Earth to hold hands around.

[children groaning]
Son, there are no aliens.

I've tried to be patient with
your unscientific interests...

[children shouting]
...bigfeets, ghosts,

vampire-bees...

You saw those sting marks,

and you know I eat
a lot of honey now.

Well, as a man of science,
I need proof,

and I just haven't seen...

Proof? Proof?

[door clattering]

How do you need
more proof than this?

Everything I've collected from
my countless battles with Zim,

from my daring travels
into the unknown things

your science has closed its eyes to.

It makes it very difficult
to get to the lawnmower.

That's Tak's ship,
an alien spaceship

I captured from
one of Zim's alien enemies.

Shouldn't spaceships fly?

It will, as soon
as it lets me fix it.

[metal clangs]
[Tak's ship] Dib, your face is stupid.

[Professor Membrane]
It's a fine, fake spaceship

you've built there, son, but...

Fake? It's not...

Dad, nobody believes me,

so I'm used to defending
our world on my own,

but I wish, just once,

you'd have my back.

Wishing isn't very scientific, son.

[angry grunting]

[insect buzzes]



I'm ready for
everything you got!

[door creaks]

[announcer on TV]
<i>Welcome back once again...</i>

Uh...
<i>- ...countdown to Peace Day...</i>

Intruder!

Prepare to come on in!

[on TV] <i>I'm Ian Cornish, your host,</i>

<i>on this beautiful, sunny day.</i>

<i>And joining us for our
countdown to Peace Day</i>

<i>is Bloaty the Pig.</i>

<i>What do you have for us, Bloaty?</i>

Hey, Zim's evil robot.

Where's Zim?
Mmm-mmm.

<i>This my special pizza</i>

<i>I make just for Peace Day.</i>

[retches]
[kids cheering]

<i>It got ten kinds of pizza</i>

<i>inside the pizza,</i>

<i>so that's pretty good.</i>

[kids cheering]

Where's Zim?


I worry about
that boy so much.

You want some nachos?


Uh, no, thank you.

Hey, keep it down out here.

I'm trying to be miserable
in my cheesy cocoon of misery.

What's going on in here?

What's all this junk?
[metallic clattering]

Yeah, they're all experiments

that I was hoping would be
Phase Two of my plan.


Oh, hello, son!

Yeah.

I figured he could replace

your actual dad.

And then, I don't know,

ground you forever or something.

I just couldn't get it
to make pudding

the way you love so much.

It ruined the illusion!
[bowl clatters]

I don't love pudding.
What's that smell?

The smell's all me.

What you gonna do about it?
[blows raspberry]

I'm gonna lock you up, is what!


Wait, really? Why?

[device chirps]

of the Irken Armada.

And there,

shmillions of light years
away from that path

is Earth.

Do you see what this means, human?

That your leaders only fly
in a straight line?

The Tallest aren't coming!

So, you really give up?
[whimpering]

I actually finally win?


Earth is safe.


I've lost the respect of My Tallest!

Uh...


Come on, man.

[Professor Membrane] <i>There may come a time
when we at Membrane Labs</i>

<i>stop making the world more amazing.</i>

You know, my dad doesn't respect
what I do, either.

[Professor Membrane] <i>That time is not now.</i>

He thinks I'm crazy
like the rest of the world,

the world I just saved
without anybody knowing.

[Professor Membrane] <i>Tomorrow,
at the Membrane Labs Keynote,</i>

<i>we make history again.</i>

<i>Membrane Labs.
Who wants a better everything?</i>

[pig squeals]
Wait a minute, the keynote.

Dad's announcing
the new Membracelet tomorrow.

The whole world'll be watching.

If I could somehow take control
of Dad's keynote stream,

I can expose a real alien, you,

live in front of the entire planet.

[cheers and applause]

[as Professor Membrane in strange accent]
I believe you, Dib.

I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

[crowd cheering]

[cheering]
[squealing]

Whoo! Yeah, yeah!

You just might still
be good for something, Zim.

What do you say?


[cheers and applause]

[indistinct chatter]

[Professor Membrane] Ladies and gentlemen,

I am so very proud
to announce...

the new Peace Day edition

Membracelet!

[cheers and applause]

Dib,

why is Zim here?

Don't worry about it, Gaz.

It's... I'll explain later.

This is Dad's big night.

Don't even think of doing
anything dumb, or...

Gaz, don't worry. Just go.

Enjoy the show.

I'm sure it's gonna be something special.

Whew. Okay, Zim.

Did you use your alien stuff
to take over the control room?

Oh, yeah.
Give me a minute.


[device whooshes and whirs]

[device chirps]

[Professor Membrane]
<i>...apps such as Peanut Simulator...</i>


[blob squeaks]
Just hit that button,

and you'll be in control
of everything.

Is this update squeaking?

I guess so.
[blob squeaks]

I can't believe I'm saying it,

but this is your greatest work ever.

Eh.

As you know,
tomorrow is Peace Day,

and nobody is as excited for
the big celebration as I am.


[Professor Membrane]
Not scientifically possible!

Children. We discovered they generate

an energy field of limitless,
chaotic potential.

We call that child energy "Childergy."

The new Membracelet
harnesses that childergy

and channels it outward
as pure peace and joy.

[all] Ooh.
[Professor Membrane] Tomorrow,

children will hold hands...
[bracelet chirps]

...encircling the planet
in Membracelets

to bring about a peace
unlike any

the world has ever known.
[cheers and applause]

Get ready to see the truth, world,

but specifically, Dad.

[computers chirps]

[machinery powering down]

Huh?

[crowd gasps]

[electricity crackles]

[crowd gasps and chatters]

Oh, no.

Greetings, fellow humans.

Zim? Wait, what?

Where's my dad?

I'm, eh, Professor Zim.

Oh, so that other guy just retired
and put me in charge,

and I just made some
exciting new changes to the bracelet.

[woman] Eww!
[man] No!

Wait! Zim's an alien!

[crowd gasps]
[man] No!

He...

[playful music playing]

[in Zim's pre-recorded voice]
<i>He's so cool.</i>

<i>We should all do
everything he says,</i>

<i>no matter how evil it sounds.</i>

<i>Hail Zim!</i>

[cheers and applause]

Yes, be joyous, you fools.

Buy my bracelet,

and get ready for
the most peaceful Peace Day

your grotesque eyeballs
have ever seen!

[crowd gasps]

[balloon deflates]

The bracelet comes in four colors!

[cheers and applause]

[laughs maniacally]

[muffled protests]

[muffled growls]



Please say that was
just a horrible nightmare.

[Professor Membrane] Son!
Dad?

Breakfast is ready.

Yes! Yes!

Yes, yes!

Good morning, Da...

Oh, no!

Happy Peace Day, son!

You is grounded forever.

Bweakfast is da most
science-y meal of da day.

Doop, doop, doop, do â™ª</i>

Pudding.

If Foodio 3000 could just perhaps...

No, foody guy!
I taking care of it.


These my kids
and science and stuff.

Gaz, I'm so sorry.
Zim tricked me.

I didn't mean for any of this to...

What?

You didn't mean
to ruin Dad's big show,

get him kidnapped,
and hand Zim the keys

to Membrane Labs
while you and I are held prisoner

by something that looks like
Dad having an allergic reaction

to radioactive bees?

Eh, something the matter, honey?

Nah, it's cool, Dad.

How can you be so calm?
That thing isn't Dad.

Yeah, look.

You're not our dad!

Oh, man, here we go.

to say, son.

[wails]
[crashing]



Oh, Dib, always kidding.

Of course, he's our dad.

Great breakfast, Dad.

[wailing]
Is it good pudding?

I've ever had in my life.

Thanks, honey.

It's not easy taking care
of two kids on my own...


You're a clone.

Our real dad's been kidnapped by Zim.

Son, it not nice to say bad things

about your best friend.

Zim is not my best friend.

He's wonderful.
No, he's the worst.

You love Zim?
No!

I hate him! He's the most...

I love Zim.


And find Dad, but Clembrane's fast.

Clembrane?
Clone, membrane.

And yeah, I already tried
busting out every possible way.

No luck.

You tried escaping without me?

Let's focus on the now, Dib.

Every move I made,
he was there to stop me.

Remember, kids,

I'm here for you if you ever
need to talk about stuff...

[pained shouting]

Stay in school.
Brush your teeth.

That's good advice, Dad.

[music plays on TV]
Ooh, it's time for Peace Day now!


[parade music playing]

to our Peace Day coverage...</i>


<i>...you're watching Zim,
the new head of Membrane Labs,</i>

<i>personally overseeing the sale
of his new Membracelet</i>

<i>from one of the new mobile M-Labs Stores</i>

<i>deployed all around the world.</i>


Yeah! [laughs]

Yeah!
[bird squawks]

[crowd shouting excitedly]

[Zim laughing maniacally]

So, this show is just
Zim laughing the whole time?

[continues laughing]


<i>the laughing portion
of the program.</i>

People of Earth,
of which I am one,

because I am human
and inferior and disgusting

just like you are,
Happy Peace Day!

[cheers and applause]

My amazing new Peace Day Bracelet

is a huge success!

You, barely sentient bag
of meat and juice,

what do you think
of my new bracelet?

I love it!

It's a lot more alive
than I expected, though.


Already, children around the world

are beginning to hold hands.

Soon, the ring of children
will connect right here,

and my greatest plan
shall be revealed!

[laughs maniacally]

to love his job.</i>

Wait a minute.
That place looks familiar.

Is that...

[cackling]
[Clembrane grunts]

Zim!

Get off my lawn!

Hi, Dib!

What are you doing here?

I live here!

You're gonna have to speak up!

You won't get away with this!

What?

You won't get a...
What?

You won't get awa...
What?

You won't get away...
What?

You...
What?

Dib, check out how huge
your head looks on TV.


I'm here for you, buddy.
Come here.



<i>- Harder!</i>
[children grunting]


<i>Work harder for Zim.</i>

[laughs maniacally]
[angry meowing]



Look at them, GIR.

All this time
trying to subjugate the humans,

and all I had to do
was charge them for it.


But the children of Earth
are letting me down.

I need you to use the power
of your Irken robot brain

to create a song about peace.

One so inspiring, the children will have
no choice but to peace harder!

Like this?

[imitating trumpet music]

Mmm-hmm?
No, GIR.

[gasps]
Try again.

[clears throat] Oh.

I think I know.

[computer chirps]



Yes. Yes.

[both grunting]

[door whirring]
Huh? [gasps]

[upbeat music playing]


<i>â™ª Peace is nice â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Peace is better than â™ª</i>

It's working!

Stop!

Zim's done something to the bracelets!

Don't hold hands!

Relax. It's Zim we're talking about.

Whatever he's got planned,
it's not gonna work.


[chuckles wickedly]

[nervous whimpering]

[kids grunting]

No!

[birds chirping]


Ha! Nothing happened, Zim!

Of course nothing happened, human.

It's not enough
to simply attach

a space-phasing
alien horror blob

to these bracelets.

"Space phasing"?

You'd also need something
with the power to harness

the dark energy of space

to activate them.

<i>Only one being
in the known universe</i>

<i>has such a power.</i>

<i>My creation, Minimoose.</i>

[men chanting]<i> â™ª Minimoose â™ª</i>

[children exclaiming in confusion]


[house creaks]

Huh?
[GIR whimpers]


Behold my victory!

[crowd gasps]

[panicked screams]

Look at me being wrong.

What have you done, Zim?


I've teleported the Earth
to a part of space

directly in the path
of the Irken Armada.

Now The Tallest
have to visit me next.

Where's our dad?
You what?

I can't believe I fell for
your sad, shmoopy act!

My shmoop was no act.

I truly felt I had failed The Tallest,

but then you told me
about the power of the bracelet,

inspiring me.
It's funny, really.

Laughter, GIR.
[giggles]

And I owe it all to...

I smell pudding.

...to you!


[loud whooshing]
[house rumbling]

Eh?

[crowd gasping]

Is that part of your brilliant plan, Zim?

Eh, probably.

I mean, I'm so incredible,
even I don't know everything I do.

Computer, what is that thing
in space that just happened?


created by the incredibly stupid
teleportation of an entire planet.

And is "Florpus Hole"
as cool as it sounds?

all nearby worlds,

wherein they will collide violently
with alternate realities.

There, you see?
It's just a shmorpus hole.

Besides, The Tallest'll get here
long before there's any trouble.

Zim, that Florpus
is gonna destroy the Earth,

you included!

If you're so worried
about the Florpus,

just get your dad to help.

I'm over here, everybody.

He's only a shmillion light years away

on Moo-Ping 10,
also known as

Space Prison!

[both gasp]

Why don't you hop in your spaceship
and go rescue him?

Oh, wait,
you don't have a spaceship!

[clears throat] Lawrence!

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I've got some Tall company
on the way.

Zim!

[alert blares]

[comms officer] My Tallest?

Something appears to have
appeared in our path.

What is it?

A terrifying, deadly space anomaly.

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, interesting.
Mmm, yeah, okay.

As well as the planet Earth.

[shouts angrily]

Earth? That means Zim!

This is the worst news
I've ever heard.

Sirs, we still have quite
a bit of time to change course.

But we're going straight.

Yeah. Turning's no fun.

Why is this happening?

Make it not happen.

[both groaning loudly]

It's been ten years, Gaz.

Ten long years trapped in this house
with the pudding monster.

It's been two days, but yeah.

How come you kids don't play
with the science puppy

I made for you?

[Dib] Because it's pudding.
[dog barks]

I hate this
as much as you do,

but it's not like anyone can
just walk out the front door.

Doop, doop, bee, doop â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Doop, doop
Doop, bee, doop â™ª</i>


Doop, doop, doop, bee, doop â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Doop, doop, doop
Bee, doop, doop â™ª</i>

[door slams]

Okay, it's not like we can
just walk out the front door,

but maybe we can... Hmm.

Hey, Dad.


Stop calling him "Dad!"

to that ham,</i>

<i>'cause it's not the last time</i>

<i>you're gonna see that ham
in the story.</i>

[muffled grunting]
Dad,

you and Dib need more
father-son time together.

Just look at him.
He's all messed up,

needs more
quality time with you.

Ooh, I see what you mean.

You got any suggestions?

Hmm.

This was a good idea, honey.

Science projects bring families together.

How can I help you, son?

You need me to put
some science pudding on it?

Uh, maybe later.

You just keep stirring, uh, Dad.

[wind whooshing]

[Tak's ship whirs]
Whoa.

[Tak's ship] Festering human,

you have stolen me away
from my rightful owner!

Look, ship, I get that
you don't like me and all,

but we need your help.

[Tak's ship] I don't help anyone but Tak.

See? It's no use.

You hate Dib, right?
Affirmative.

But you hate Zim even more.

Correct.

I see where
you're going with this.

Helping us break our dad
out of Moopington would...

Wait, do you mean
Moo-Ping 10?

Right.

It would make Zim
super unhappy.

[Tak's ship] Flawless logic.
I will help you.


[Tak's ship] On one condition.
What's that?

Disconnect my seat sensors

so I don't feel your
terrible human butts in me.

Deal.

[whip cracks]

[ship rumbles and whirs]

[pudding sizzles]


[ship whirs]

We did it, kids.
Hurray for science.

Right. Now, about that pudding...


Don't wait up for us, Clembrane!

[ship whooshes]


[space organisms howling]

[Florpus Hole crackling]
[Tak's ship]<i> Oh.</i>

You guys have a deadly Florpus Hole now.

That's new.
[Dib] Yeah.

Let's hurry, ship.
Don't tell me what to do.

But okay.

Now, this is what
I like to see, GIR.

Pathetic humans fleeing in terror

at the sight of Zim!


[car alarm goes off]
It's a show of respect.

Their stupid eyes can't handle all this.


Anyhow, terrible work on the signs, GIR,

worse than I expected.

Aww, thank you.

Did you build me
that throne I asked for?

Mmm-hmm.

[bird chirps]

[GIR humming]

[ground rumbles and whooshes]


Now, to ascend this throne,

and claim my rightful place as...

[grunts and yelps]


Hah! But where are the flames?

I can't rule the world without cool flames
shooting up behind me.

[whirring excitedly]

Hit the flames button!

Hmm? Ah-ha!

[chair whooshes]

[laughs maniacally]

Wait, are those peanuts?


Try the peanuts button.

flames, uh, peanuts,

flames, uh, peanuts?

Oh!

[flames whoosh]
[laughs maniacally]

Hmm?

[engine turning over]

[continues laughing]

[panicked grunts]



The Tallest will be so happy!

[The Tallest moaning]
We're so unhappy!

Zim's so close,
I can almost smell him.

[comms office]
Sirs, really, it's no big deal.

We can just steer around the...

Wait, why steer around the Earth

when we can just blow it up?

Yeah, we're great at blowing stuff up.

[alert blips]
What is that?

[comms officer] It appears to be a...
Blow it up!

[cheery tune playing]


[comms office] But, sirs,
there's still the life-destroying

space hole to consider.

Man, this guy.

"I fly the spaceship,

and I sure love steering!"


steering all over the place.

Look at me steering with
my wittle steering hands."

I like that we're funny.

[Dib singing gibberish]

[upbeat music playing]

[music stops]
[both] Hey!

[Tak's ship] Your noises are bad.
Also, we're here.

Moo-Ping 10,

prison to the galaxy's
most infamous criminals.

Okay, their defenses
are about to go down.

How do you know?

[Tak's ship] Just get ready.

All right, now what?

[Tak's ship] I'll go cause a diversion
and come back

when you've found your dog.

Our dad.
Whatever.

[guards speaking alien language]


[alarms blaring]

That's our diversion.
You ready?

I was born ready, Gaz.

This spy coat isn't just to look cool.


[slurps and gulps]

[speaks in alien language]

[sings gibberish]

[grunts]
[Dib] Now we'll never find Dad!


Oh, uh,

normally, you crying
on the floor is hilarious,

but come on.

It's all my fault, Gaz. [groans]

Why aren't you saying
I told you so?

'Cause making fun of you
is no fun when you're this sad.

You're my brother, man.

I only torment you
because I know you can handle it.

I've done way worse
than throwing you in a space prison.

This is nothing.
Get up!

I was supposed to save the world, Gaz,

not help Zim destroy it.

I was gonna show people the truth.

I knew if they saw
something amazing,

even if it was horrible,
like Zim,

people would just wake up,

and stop obsessing
over all the little things

and see that there was
something bigger out there,

something to unite against.

Instead of fighting each other,

the world would know
there was...

Shut up and look!

[Professor Membrane laughs]

Dad!
[Professor Membrane] Son!

[aliens] Aww!
[Professor Membrane] I didn't want to

interrupt your lovely, imaginary speech.

Imaginary?

Well, the last thing
I remember was something

hitting me on the head

and starting
this incredible hallucination.

No, this is all really happening.

Zim used your bracelets
to teleport the Earth

to another part
of the universe!

Do you know how?


[Professor Membrane] Son, the Membracelet
is just for running apps

and world peace,
but, oh, theoretically...

[aliens gasp]
...one could use it to, say,

create a galactic star gate of sorts, yes.

What?

That's crazy, yo.

[aliens gasp]

Well, we knew it was possible,

but only with the addition
of a purely theoretical

alien horror blob energized
by a purely theoretical

tiny purple space moose.
[aliens chuckling]

But all those things don't exist,

so we didn't worry about it.

Minimoose!

Dad, if you had that purple space moose,

could you use it
to teleport the Earth

back where it belongs?

Theoretically, mmm-hmm.

Too bad we're in prison.

[Tak's ship whirs and whooshes]

[Tak's ship]
Three human butts is too many,

so I brought this.

Hop in.

[Professor Membrane] This is all so real!

Not a hallucination.
[Gaz] Shotgun!


[door hisses]

[aliens cheering]
[alien] See you later!

Only enough room in there
for you guys, I guess.

[ship whooshes]


[Tak's ship] Hang on
to your disgusting butts!

What's with you and butts?


[laughs maniacally]
Okay, okay.

Okay, enough running and screaming.

Let's mix it up a bit.

Maybe bow down before me or something.

[buildings creaking]
[screams]

[people scream]

Hmm, leaping is good.

[ship whooshes]

[Professor Membrane]
Well, that was very convincing.

Because it's real, Dad!

[Professor Membrane] How could
anything that horrifying be real?

[Florpus Hole crackling]

[both scream]
[Professor Membrane laughs]


Dad, the Earth's minutes away
from being destroyed!

Why are you laughing?

[Professor Membrane]
Minimoose is a funny name.

[Tak's ship grunts]

[Tak's ship] Normally, I'd say
"Don't touch me,"

but maybe a little help?

[screen chirping]

[screams and laughs]

[Dib grunts]

Huh?

[space organism moans]
[Gaz yelps]

[Professor Membrane laughing]

[Dib and Gaz screaming]

[alarms blaring]
[Tak's ship] This isn't good.

Gaz!

[Gaz screams]

[structure creaking]


[Professor Membrane] Marvelous!


I truly believe
I'm falling to a hideous death!

Hang on, Dad!

Don't let go!

[Professor Membrane] Don't worry.
None of this is real.

I'll prove everything to you.
[cat meows]

Just hang on!

You'll be proud of me!

[Professor Membrane] Son,
you don't have to prove anything.

I'm always proud of you.

Dad!


The humans cower in fear
before my superior Irken might,

and just in time.

Is that The Tallest
I see approa...


[grunts]
[squeaks]


Dib?

You...

Give me the moose.



[panting and screaming]

Huh? Huh? Huh?


Zim, that moose is the only thing

that can save Earth
from your Florpus!


This one's mine!
[squeaks]

Hah, I think you're cool too, Minimoose.

[both speaking alien language]

[shocked grunt]






[all singing in alien language]

[all screaming]

[screaming and chomping]

Give me the moose.
No!

Give me the moose.
No!

Give me the moose.
No!

when you were a chair!

And I liked you better
when you were a toilet!

I was not a toilet!

[playful music playing]
[robotic meowing]

[Dib grunting] Leprechaun cat, no...


I was hiding in the toilet.

[screams and grunts]


[robots whirring]

Hmm?


Zim!

No!

[Zim laughs maniacally]

Well, he's dead.

GIR, all this evil is doing
a number on my throat.

Fetch me a soothing lozenge!

Huh?


Dad!

[Professor Membrane]
Why are you wearing those shirts?

I never hired any of you!

[robotic arms hiss]

[Professor Membrane] Don't worry, son.

I've got your back.


Spencer! Devon!

Maria!
[Professor Membrane] Come on!

Lawrence!

No!

[Professor Membrane] Ah-ha!

[GIR squeals]
[hollers]

[both grunt]

GIR, avenge your robot brothers and Maria.

Yes, my master!

[roars]
[wind whooshes]

[knife clinks]

[balloon deflates]

You're terrible, GIR!

It's over, Zim.

[sips]
Oh, it is?

Well, now I'm sad. Wait!

Have you forgotten?

You're grounded!

Uh-oh.

And you, get away from my son!
[choking]

[Professor Membrane] Uh...

[babbles]
...what's happening?

[babbles]
What is this thing?

He's you, Dad.
[Professor Membrane] What?

Who's me, son? I'm me.

But who's that? Pudding break.


[Professor Membrane]
I'm very confused right now.


You've discovered the clone
is not actually

your real father!

You told me he wasn't my real father.

Pudding break over.

[Professor Membrane]
Oh, this feels so real!

We need that moose, Dad!
[crashes in distance]

than moose jealousy, Dib.

Ooh, what the... Where did...

[Tak's ship grunts]

[Tak's ship] Yours is the worst...

butt of them all, Zim.

Dib!

Do you still have
that ham I gave you?

Of course!

The ham!

There's that ham again.</i>

Ham!

[grunts weakly]

[Professor Membrane]
Great work, honey, but...


Oops.

Honey, fighting doodn't solve anything.

Also, I found this little moose thing.

Look at it. Isn't it funny?


I command you
to return the moose

and destroy
the Membrane family!

But... they my family.

And that guy,

it's like looking into a mirror.

[Professor Membrane]
Oh, I don't know about...

[grunts angrily]
I should've known you'd fail me!

You couldn't even learn
to make pudding the right way.

Hey! You leave Clembrane alone!

Yeah!

[in British accent]
It's the best pudding I've ever had

in my life.

Excellent. Now, just...


No!
[squeals]

[Florpus Hole crackling]


Use the moose!

[Professor Membrane] Uh, right.
Use the moose.

Um, okay.

Everyone, hold hands again.

[Gaz in normal accent] Yeah!
Your lives depend on it!

Okay! Hold my hand.

No way! Be serious!

Now, come on, everyone. Faster!

I did my best.

It's no use, Dib.

You've lost.

The Irken Armada is already here.

Forward cannons now at full power.

[Professor Membrane] Almost have it.

Dad, hurry!

We're entering the Florpus!

[all screaming]


No pressure, Dad,

but... [screams]

[Professor Membrane] Cut me some slack!
This is my first moose!

Relax.

[in distorted voice]
It's just realities colliding

like my computer said.

[in distorted voice] And tearing
Earth apart, you moron!

[planet crackles and explodes]

[all screaming]

[Professor Membrane] Hmm, um...

[Professor Membrane] Um, um, uh, eh. Oh.

[screaming continues]

[Professor Membrane stammering]
Uh, there...


[all barking]

[grunts and screams]

[Professor Membrane] I've got it!

[Minimoose beeps]

[all screaming]

My Tallest, the Earth...

It's gone.

That's great news.

Crisis averted.
Hurray!

Now we don't have to turn.

[comms officer] Sirs, there's still
the horrifying space hole

straight ahead.

[Almighty Tallest Purple]
Why are you so negative?

[The Tallest] Yay!
Whoo-hoo!

[Almighty Tallest Purple] Yeah...
[electricity buzzes]

[Professor Membrane] Now,
prepare your eating faces

for incalculable nutrition!

[Foodio 3000 hollers and dings]

Good work, Foodio.

Thank you, Gazlene.

I hope you can taste
the love simulation I made it with.

[heavy footsteps approach]
[Clembrane] Just one final ingwedient.

and science and wobots and stuff.

So, does he live here now or what?
[Gaz grunts]

[Professor Membrane]
I'm still very confused.

[laughs]
[chuckles]


Enjoying your losers' meal,
eh, Dib?

"Losers"? Your plan failed.

Did it, Dib? Did it?

What if I told you
my plan all along

was to steal
this whatever-it-is?

Phase Two.
It was Phase Two all along.

Is that the ceramic clown puppy
from our living room?

Who's laughing now, Dib?

[laughs maniacally]

I am, see? [laughing]

[Professor Membrane] Why didn't you invite

your little green friend
in for dinner, son?

Dad, that was Zim,

the alien who almost destroyed
the world, remember?

[Professor Membrane]
Son, of course I remember.

I remember
getting hit on the head

and dreaming up
all that crazy stuff.

What?

What's happening?
Is everything over?

Yes, GIR, I'm just waiting for The Tallest

to answer this call so I can
tell them all about my success.

Did we win?
Did we win?

Did we win?
Did we win?

Did we win?
Did we win?

Did we win?
Did we win?

Did we win?
Did we win?

[inhales]
[screams] Did we win?

Of course. Zim always wins...

[tires screeching]

[keys jangling]

[door slams]
[whirring]

No thanks to you
working with the enemy.

[Minimoose squeaks]
Heh, good one, Minimoose.

I can't stay mad at you.
[screen buzzes]

Ah, here we go.

My Tallest,
I am pleased to report

my plan was a success and I now
have Dib's puppy clown thing,

which was my plan all along.

Does this please you?

[both screaming]

That sounded like a yes to me.


Yay! I missed you so much!
