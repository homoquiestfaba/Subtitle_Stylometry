to see basketball or a cockfight?

[man 1] We do everything.

[man 2 chuckles] Okay.

[ball thudding]
[players speaking indistinctly]

Big boy.

He's coming.

Do we back up? He's gonna take us out.

Oh-oh!
[grunts, speaks Serbian]

Uh-huh. What? What did he say?

He wants to go to the NBA.

Yeah, that's why we're here.
Mm-hmm.

Very impressive. Tell him.

[translates to Serbian]
Just a big man who makes shots.

[man 1 translates to Serbian]
He would be in the rotation right now.

[continues translating to Serbian]

And be a force,
he would be a powerhouse in the league.

I do have to ask something.

So it says in my files,
you're 22 years old.

<i>Da. Da.</i>

Yeah.
It's accurate? You're 22 years old?

Yes, I'm 22 years old.

The reason I'm askingâ€¦
He's speaking English?

Yeah.
You understand my English?

Because you can't be
in the draft if you're over 22,

if you're from overseas.
Do you have a birth certificate?

It was big fire.


Who's this?
It's my son.

It's your son?
[player] Yes.

How old is he?
He's ten years old.

He's ten years old. Okay. Okay.

Hey, Stan.
Hey, guys.

Good to see ya.

[man] Yeah. Who you've been dating?
[woman] Yeah. Come on, Dad.

You're not dating?
I'd never tell you who I was dating.

Just a second.
Okay.

Hi. Wow, you look tired.

I had a red-eye.
How was the German MJ?

I'm about to get into all that.
You're not staying?

I have an 11:30 call with Adam Silver.

You didn't like the kid?

Ohâ€¦ shit.

Good luck, Sugerman.

Please don't go.
[woman laughs]

Okay. Goodbye.

{\an8}[man] Kid can score at will.
Makes shots from all over the floor.

{\an8}A match-up nightmare.

{\an8}His true shooting percentage,
same as Steph's was at Davidson.

You're taking it too far.
He's just reading the stats, Billy.

I think Doc will like
the way this kid can pass.

You've seen him pass before?
I've never seen him pass.

He's playing with scrubs.
His best chance to win is to shoot.

With us, he'll adapt.

We've done the modeling.
He checks every box.

In three years he could be an All-Star.

Rex, you want to win now,
or in three years?

We want to win now.
Yeahâ€¦ [laughs]

Offensively, there's a lot to like,
but I don't think...

So what's <i>not</i> to like, Stanley?

Berlin loses a lot.

Three games
this guy didn't show up to, they won.

They're better off when he's on the bench.

You check out the efficiency stats I sent?

I actually have the stats, Stan.
Thank you.

Everyone in Germany is saying
this guy'll be the next Dirk.

Dirk never left the gym.
This guy shows up late to warm-ups.

The kid can defend all five positions.

He's physically capable of it.
He just gets bored out there.

I've been to Germany four times
in the last two months.

I've yet to see him make a third effort.

He's late on rotations.

Always bitching at refs,
bitching at teammates.

He's bitching because he cares.
He wants to win.

We've all seen the tape.

Referring to the highlights
his mother put together?

Like the BargnaniÂ tape
you tried to trade up with?

[others sigh]

[Billy] That's too soon.
[man 2] Shit.

Listen, Dad, he's a 19-year-old, 7-footer
with a 35-foot range and a guard's handle.

I see him in another team's jersey,
I'm gonna goddamn kill someone.


Cool.

Yes, sir.
Get in.

Okay.

So, I'm not drafting Haas.

Your son's gonna kill somebody.

Yeah, maybe you.

You shouldn't have backed down to him.

No, no, no, I didn't.

I didn't back down. I was just
trying to save everybody some time.

I remember when you were at Temple.

I think it was the second game
of the season,

and we were playing Saint Joe,

and some guy took Leon's knees out.

Marlon Daly.
I can't believe you remember that.

I remember you knocking him
into the second row

and then having to be held back
from fighting that entire team.

That's the reason I brought you in,
because you never took anybody's shit.

Rex, you're right.
I should have pushed back more.

I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

No, it won't.

Karl, could you pull around
to the back, please?

After I bought the team,

this was before your time,

I gave this office to my Uncle Connie.

He helped out with everything,

worked every day.

Sorry, I didn't make it happen
for you sooner.

I know it's not on the bench,
but it's behind the bench.

So what do you think?

I can't believe you made
your uncle work in this closet.

Thank you.

Feels like I've been waiting
my whole life to become a coach.

Come here.

Come.

Never back down.

Yes, sir.
All right?

I won't.
Yeah. Yeah.

Right.


You need to zoom out
so they can see the whole thing.

Mom, no one uses filters.

I can't eat that whole cake.

Looks like you already did.

Wow, what a lovely welcome home.
I missed you guys too.

Welcome back. Welcome back. Okay.

Not a side hug. What's with the side hug?
When did you stop hugging me?

Honey, you gotta be more gentle.

Your baby's got titties now.
That's disgusting.

I don't want to hear about that.
That's between you two.

Dad, can I go to the cemetery tonight?
They're showing <i>Evil Dead.</i>

I told you I love that movie. Absolutely.

No, she can't.

No, you can't. Why can't she?

She never finished her presentation
on the Homestead Act.

Didn't finish. Why?

I don't know.

Okay, here's what we'll do.

You can go to the movie tonight.

Oh, wow.
Yes.

No. No, no. But all weekend long,
it's just you, your history books.

Sunday night,
I want a TED Talk on the Homestead Act.

Fine. Yes.
[Stanley] All right?

Okay. Cool.
Thank you.

I love you. Now can I get a hug?
Love you too.

No.
No? No, hug. [chuckles]

Why would you do that?

Because I was happy

she was actually excited
about something for a change.

And to be honest with you,
Iâ€¦ I wanted to be alone with you.

You think you'll get some love
after that bullshit you just pulled?


[faucet turns on]
I have some good news.

You might even like me again
once you hear it.

You are looking atâ€¦

Well, you're not looking,
but you're going to look soon,

at the new assistant coachâ€¦

[faucet turns off]

â€¦for the Philadelphia 76ers.

Thanks for everything.


Oh.

Yep. Yep.

That's cool.
[Stanley] Mm-hmm.

What's going on with school?
How's that going?

It's, umâ€¦

Nothing. It's fine.

In all honesty,
what do we feel about college?

Is that something you want to do?

You talked about going to film school.

So many kids are applying to film schools.

They're not going to pick me.

Oh, I'm not worried about all those
other kids. I'm worried about you.

You against you, baby.

You can get it done.
You just gotta do what you love.

Did you love being away
from home all the time?

That's what you got out of this.
[laughs]

I hated being away from home,

but now that I'm coaching,
I'm going to be around a lot more.

So we're going to get your grades up.
Together. Okay.

Love you. Bye.
I love you.

Have a good time with these guys.

Hi! I'm so excited! Hi!

No side hugs for them.
That's just for me? I love that.

my daughter footage of you jamming,

and it just brought back
so many nice memories.

You can't let 'em forget.

Right, Stanley?
No, no.

I'll let you old friends catch up.

Okay. Stay well.
Thank you.

Nice touch with the suit.
Yeah.

Leon, man, I can't believe this.

Anything you ever need, call me, man.

Yeah. I got to make the rounds.
I appreciate you.

Love you, bro.
Love you too, Leon.

Let's talk soon, 22.

Trying to think of something to say to you
besides "I'm sorry."

It doesn't seem enough.

I heard you're moving to the bench.

Uncle Connie's office.
Dad was so excited for you.

"We need a spark, Katherine."

No, man.

Your father,

he mentioned it to me years ago,
but with my past, you know,

I figured he'd rather forget about it.

He'd never forget about you, Sugerman.

You're bailing on us?

You decide where you want him to go.

Like Jrue Holiday, bro.

Exactly. Take him out of his comfort zone.

[speaks German]

Huh? I don't understand what that is.
Did you sleep last night at all?

Do your work early.
[Stanley] Let's go again.

Ready?
Okay.

Come on, Haas. Make him work.
Don't let him go baseline.

Hey, just focus.

Go again!
[man] Make him work.

Hey, Stan. You got a minute?

You want me now?

Yeah.
All right.

How's he doing?

We're working on it.
He's young. We're going to get him there.

I fucked up. Shouldn't have drafted Haas.

I wouldn't say that.
To my face?

I would say it to your face.


My father always appreciated your honesty.
I'm working on it. I really am.

Cool.

I have one job,
to maximize this team's chances

of winning an NBA championship
by any means necessary.

Hell with the naysayers. Right?

You're not wrong.

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Got the Hawks' pick next year,
we can't afford to miss.

To be champion requires sacrifice.

That's this. That's you.

You're valuable as a coach,
you're indispensable as a scout.

I don't want to be out there anymore.
I never wanted to be out there.

I'm not asking.

I haven't been home on my daughter's
birthday for nine years running, Vin.

I came to talk to you about something.

Okay.

Why don't you come
and just be an agent with me?

Got an open spot,
I got all the partners on board.

For me?

If I do that, then,

there's no room for growth.
I still want to coach.

This Philly thing,
there's room to grow there?

At least I'm still in the league,
you know.

Vin came to see me last week.

Talk about Zeke.

Talk about Zeke?
He's going one. We're out.

He could trade up,

That idiot's talking about trading Embiid?
Are you kidding me?

Look, nobody's safe now.

Guy like Vin, he wants to put
his fingerprints on the team.

Just think about my offer, Deuce.

Yeah, I know.

So tell me your whole story from the top.

He was a very strong baby.
Mama, no.

Good, I said from the top.
This is nice. Go ahead.

A very sweet boy.

When he was ten years old,

was his gym coach idea to do basketball.

And the club teams,
they want him to play football.

The gym coach was smart.

Soccer is awful.

he played with the big kids

when he was still small.

Biggest hands, though.

They tease him.

Ehmâ€¦

Phone home.

<i>- E.T.</i>
Yes. Very mean boys.

But also,

he kind of looked like an alien.

[chuckles] I bet.
He played every day.

After his father, well,

he went away. We don't have him anymore.

I'm sorry. Losing your dad at any age...

Oh, no, he's not lost.
He moved to Portugal with whore.

What? It's true, she knows.
After his father leftâ€¦

<i>Mi roble.</i>

<i>Roble? Que es "roble"?</i>

Uh-huh.

He played basketball all his time,
so he no think of him.

He was invited to a club team
in America when he was 15,

but before he left, Lucia's mother

got pregnant.

So he stayed here for Lucia.
Right.

I'm gonna make a couple of calls
so I can see you play

with some guys on your level tomorrow.

I got to work.

How old are you?

Twenty-two.
Basketball years are like dog years.

We're gonna do this,
we actually got to do this now.

And how much money will you pay him?
To come to Philly?

It'll be a prorated league minimum.

But you say he was great.

For great, you pay the maximum, no?

of any kind is maximum, no?

And how much is the minimum?
Minimum salary in the NBA is $900,000.

He will call in sick.

All right.
I'll text you the details in the morning.

What a pleasure.

Bo Cruz. Love the name.

Don't know. His bus must be running late.

He doesn't have a car.

Right on time.

Here's my man, the Cruz Missile.

What?
What?

You don't like that?
I thought you'd love that.

No? I'll keep thinking.

So I want you to meet Coach Scariolo.

You know him. Spanish national team.
<i>- Â¿QuÃ© tal?</i>

<i>- Hola.</i>
Bo Cruz.

Felipe. Ãlex.

These guys are being nice.
They're gonna let you play with 'em.

Willy, JosÃ©, Pierre. Bo Cruz.

Go on down and get laced up,
stretch out a little bit.

We're going to have some fun.

[in Spanish] You want to try?

[players discussing in Spanish]

[players exclaiming]

Willy, you're off the team.

[in English] Yo, get some sneakers on.

Be careful.

[player] He can jump.
[Stanley] Yeah, he can jump.

[Stanley on speaker] <i>You believe this?</i>
<i>He hit 44 out of 50 from the side pocket.</i>

<i>He's incredible!</i>

You watch the workout?

<i>Kid's impressive.</i>

But there are other considerations.

Character, mentality.
Playing within a system.

I sound like you right now.

Vin, this kid is the new Freak.

He's a unicorn, a mythical creature.

The kid hasn't played
organized basketball in eight years.

There's a reason for that.

Let's see what he can do in the G League.
<i>- You fucking play in the G League, Blake.</i>

All right, listen to me, Vin.

<i>Nobody knows about him.</i>

<i>You're going to see this guy,
you're gonna freak the fuck out.</i>

I promise you, you have to see him live.

It's not gonna happen, Stan.

I'm indispensable.

So valuable, right?

<i>You told me if I wanted to get back
on the bench to find the missing piece.</i>

Well, here I am delivering him
for no money.

And it's not gonna happen?

I pay you to find players,
not tell me what to do with them.

Pay me.

You got something to say, Stan?


<i>don't have a roster spot at the moment,</i>

<i>but they love what they saw
and want to see more.</i>

And let's just say a spot doesn't open up,

we'll get your name in the draft.

So you play like you did yesterday,
at the combine, you'll be a lock.

They still pay me to come.

They'll pay you for sure.

It might not come at once,
but you'll get the money.

I promise you.
Okay.

Giant body like yours
on an eight-hour flight is gonna be rough.

You'll take my seat, okay?

Oh, really?
Okay. Yeah, no problem.

[on PA] <i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

<i>I'd like to welcome everyone aboard
Flight 718. We're currently cruising atâ€¦</i>

[attendant speaking Spanish]


Look what I got.

[Stanley] Oh, yes.
They are warm.

That's good.
You want some?

Uhâ€¦ I don't want to start a riot
back here. It's cool, thanks.

One bite?
No, I'm trying not to, badly.

It's really good.
Just give me a fucking roll. Thank you.


[indistinct conversation]


Oh, hey, that's my kid.

Yo, excuse me.
No, no, he's with me. He's with me.

[man speaking Spanish]

What's up, Oscar? What happened?

He got flagged
for an aggravated assault charge.

Beat up a guy pretty bad five years ago.

Ah, Jesus.
He needs to be very careful.

He goes in front of a judge
for even running a stop sign,

he can get his visa permanently revoked.

Right. Okay.

Are you looking at him for the draft?

Yeah. We're all very excited about him.
This is something I should have caught.

I don't want the team
paying for my mistake.

So keep this between us.
I'll cover your hours.

No problem. Just bring us back home
a championship, right?

Will do, Oscar.
Good.

Thank you.

Fuck.

Anything else you need to tell me?
Now is the time.

We all have stuff from our past,

but having a criminal record's
a pretty big detail to leave out.

from now on, all right?

No big deal, moving on.

I got you this,

for local and international calls.

You can talk to your daughter anytime.

Thanks, Stanley.
Philadelphia, baby.

You're gonna love it.
Best sports fans in the world.

Actually the worst,
but that's what makes 'em the best.

<i>â™ª We from P-H-I-L-A, period, P-A, period
Eve, they hearing it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Believe they fearing it
But loving it though â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I hate the game, â€¦the fame
But I'm loving the dough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, Philly, Philly â™ª</i>

all by himself?

He wanted to call his daughter.

I gave him money. He's settling in.

So when are you taking this,
what's his name again?

Bo Cruz.

When are you taking Bo
across the river to train with the team?

I don't know
if I want to give them this guy yet.

Just wanna make sure
I do what's right for the kid.

What?

The Sixers don't know you stashed him.

You don't get it. The kid is like
if Scottie Pippen and a wolf had a baby.

So what are you saying?
He has a hairy face.

I'm saying if this kid puts it together,

when he puts it together,
he will be top ten in the league.

And being the guy who finds the guy
matters in this business.

Won't Vince fire you for this?
Tâ€¦

The kid isâ€¦ special.

Okay.

With the cheese or with the whole thing?

Yeah?

You should have stopped me again.
This is fucking atrocious.

<i>â™ª Don't try to claim things
I haven't earned honest, man â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What kid? â™ª</i>

[song stops]

Yeah.

You're looking for the big man?
He ain't here.

Where is he?
Make a right on 13th.

<i>â™ª Youngâ€¦ blowin' old money â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Spend a milli', make it back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Made enough off a old hustle
I don't even gotta rap â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Grind and I get it, stack and I spend it
You know the routine â™ª</i>

Hey, what are you doing?

[crowd exclaims]
Careful, please.

[crowd cheers]

All right, that's it. That's it.

Take your money.

Goodness.

I see. We're not here to hustle, man.

Why not?

Let's go.

Good Lord.

Why?
[Bo] Hey, Stanley.

Have you ever tried these Ishkabibble's?

Oh, my God. [sniffs]

Yeah, but you got five cheese steaks.


one bite of each one.

You take one bite and you don't eat
it all, because if not, you get fat.

Why did you look at me when you said that?

Come on, Stanley, I don't say that.
Okay.

What the fuck did you do to the minibar?


Yes, but we don't eat $9 Pringles.
A man must have a code.

I literally eat one chip.
They are not that good.

It's still $9.
They don't charge you per chip.

Okay. Anyways, I got some good news.

Um, an old friend, Leon Richâ€¦
Leon Rich who played for Timberwolves?

Right. We played together in college.

He's a power agent now, and he's in Philly
with a few of his guys for an open run.

Like, who are these guys?

College kids.
NBA prospects getting ready for the draft.

It's a scrimmage,
but it gets serious out there.

So it's like a real tryout?

No, no, no.

It's just a showcase, not a big deal,
just a step in the process.

The whole idea is to give
young bucks a place to shine.

So you're just gonna go out there,
and you're gonna shine, Bo Cruz.

Okay, let's go.

{\an8}<i>â™ª What you want now? I'm the one now â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª I gotta run now â™ª
â™ª Wait, wait, wait, wait â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the one now â™ª</i>

[both laughing]

â™ª <i>It's a bird, it's a plane</i>
<i>No, it's me, ha ha ha â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]


Come here.

Hey, Matisse, Kyle.
'Sup?

Bo. This is Vin Merrick.
He's co-owner of the Sixers,

but he basically runs the team.

And Leon Rich, basically,
he runs the world.

The Double Deuce
told me a lot about you, man.


We certainly have heard a lot about you
from Stanley, and Oscar Morales.

Our in-house counsel,
he met you at the airport.

Yeah, they met. Go get laced up, bud.

Huge fan.
Thanks, man.

How you know he's talking about you?
Come on.

Sorry, but I had to bring him.

You're going to see why
after you watch the kid play.

Good luck.

Appreciate it.

Fellas.

What is Kermit Wilts doing here?
The guy's a lock at two.

He thinks he should be number one.

Just stay with him wherever he goes.

Don't let him score in bunches.
Don't let him get hot. Okay?

He's here to show off.
Use that. Get physical with him.

You give Kermit Wilts the business, your
whole world's going to change overnight.

You got this shit, go get it.

Best of luck out there, man.

What's your name?
Bo.

Bo. I like that.
Strong, strong like a bull.

Let's give these people a show.
What do you say, Bo?

So, where are you from?

Spain.

Shit sounds wack.

Y'all like bull fights over there, right?

So, here's what's going to happen.
You're the bull.

I'm the motherfucker with a cape running
your big dumb ass in circles. That's cool.

Let's get it.

[whistle blows]

Get up on him, baby.

Stay with him.

[crowd cheers]

We're good.

Right here.

Go ahead, make something happen.

[whistle blows]

That's it. Yes, sir.

Who's this?
Stan brought him.


[crowd cheers]

Welcome to America.


Hey, hey.
[players speaking indistinctly]

I don't need no help.

[ball dribbling]

[crowd cheers]

That's it. Nice.

I like... I like him. I like him.

This is gonna be good.

He's got a lot of length.
Does he have any control?

Yeah!
[Stanley] Nice swat! Way to get after it.

Good D.

[crowd cheers]

Finna hit you with a hazy, cross sidestep.

Think you can stop me?

[crowd exclaims]

Yeah!

Stan's kid getting a lesson here.

You're good. Don't come over here.

Shit.
He's like a giraffe on roller skates.

Shake that off. Shake it off.

You get it, right?

Step back three.
Really can't guard me, bro.

[crowd cheers]

Damn, you slow.

Hey, let's take a seat for a minute.
No.

Just give yourself a breather.

Listen to your daddy.

Here comes a brick.

Oh, yeah!

You can see it's getting to his head.

[unnerving music playing]

Oh! It's okay.
I think the game's too fast for him.

Nothing.

[both laugh]

Move out the way.

All right, kid.

[laughter]
[unnerving music continues]

[crowd cheering]

<i>OlÃ©,</i> bitch!

Shit.

He had his moments. I saw it.

That wasn't him.
That wasn't even close to him.

I rushed this whole thing.

Remember our freshman year,
we were playing at Gonzaga,

they put John Stockton on me?

You said watch out for this guy.
I said nobody looking like

an insurance salesman
going to bust my ass.

Midway through the second half,
20 points, 20 assists.

None of y'all would look at me. Remember?
I remember.

Remember me playing like that again?

No, 'cause I never wanted
to feel that feeling again.

So tonight's a good thing.

Nothing was good about tonight.

That was some awfulâ€¦ [laughing]

Wanna grab some din-din?
I got to catch a plane.

You're gonna have to pick up the tab
on the Spanish kid. I'm not interested.

Time to get back out there
and keep looking.

You're gonna miss
another one of your daughter's birthdays.

The Sixers will send
something nice for her.

Hey, I never asked you
to pick up the tab on him, Vincent.

Frankly, I'm not interested

in working for a smug,
born-on-third fucking bitch.

So how's this?

Kiss my fat ass,
and fuck your five-star hotels.

I quit.

So Stanley's not coming to dinner?

I really wish he was now.
[laughter]

how to fuck up his life.

Another bad decision in the books.

The combine's in six weeks.

Can you get my guy in?

I'll work on it.

Don't have a heart attack, man.
Come on, 22.

I fly home tomorrow.

Is that what you want to do?

You come all this way,

have one bad day,
and you're ready to back down?

No, but I suck.
Do you love this game?

Love it with your whole heart?

Because if you don't,
let's not even bother.

Let's not open that door.
They're gonna slam it right in our face.

I love this game. I live this game.

And there's 1,000 other guys waiting in
the wings who are obsessed with this game.

Obsession is gonna beat talent every time.

You've got all the talent in the world,
but are you obsessed?

Is it all you ever think about?

Let's face it,
it's you against you out there.

When you walk on that court, you have
to think, "I am the best guy out there."

"I don't care if LeBron's playing."

So let me ask you again.
Do you love this game?

Yes.

Is there a newborn kitten
purring in here right now?

I couldn't hear you.

[shouts] Do you want to be in the NBA?
Yes!

Let's make that happen.

Never back down.

[soft music playing]

[phone vibrating]

Hello.

<i>I'm out front.</i>

Stanley, it's 4:10, man.

Bring your shit.

Kobe used to get up at 4:00 a.m.
so he could practice before practice.

I got you a gift.

[Bo chuckles]

Kobes.
That's right, for inspiration.

Let's get to work.
[engine starts]

The combine's in a month and a half.

It's a televised game, so the whole
world's gonna get to see you play.

We got to get you ready.

[groans softly]

So you see this hill?

Average professional biker can get
to the top of this hill in two minutes.

We're gonna come out here every morning
till you get the top, running, minute-45.

Shit.
Yeah.

And three, two, one.

[car horn beeps]
Let's go. Move it, kid. Yup.

Looking good.

That's it, man. That's it. I like it.

Go, go, go!

Pump it.

Pump those arms.

[inspirational music playing]

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Don't stop. To the top.

Oh, we're going to be here
a lot, bud. Let's go!

Keep going, come on. Find it in you.

You got to push it, bro.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna hit your heels.

Oh, my goodness gracious.

[coughing]
Okay. All right, so that's time.

I had no idea
this stopwatch went that high.

I'm not shitting you.

When we were teaching my daughter to walk,
she got up this hill faster than you.

Just get in the car.

Whew. We've got a lot of work to do, baby.

Ah, you're getting sweat in my Malibu.

[Bo sighs tiredly]
[laughs] Oh, all right.

Bo.

Hi. This is my daughter, Alex.

This is Bo.
Nice to meet you.

Hi.
She's going to be shooting us today.

Are you ready, kid?

Alex.
Yes.

All right. All right.
I've never seen her like that.

That was funny.

All right.

Get this.
Alex, get this round. Initiate contact.

Don't get jammed. Get past that.

Drive. Use your legs. Downhill.
Down. Finish...

[grunting]
Come on. All right.

Your first year in the league, no calls.

You need a hand up?

Get out of here. Don't look so sad.

Go ahead. Zoom in
on that sad face of his right now.

I want you to finish through it. Let's go.

All right,
shoulders down, that's right. Go!

Okay. All right.

You absorbed the contact. I need you
to finish through the contact.

Alex, you get that?
Okay, we're getting there. Go, go, go!

Cut. Move. Go downhill!
All the way, now finish it.

Oh! That's how you take it to the rim.

What happened? Were you on me?
Always on the money, sweetheart.

Good God.

He is mad because he's hungry.
[laughs]

What'd he say?
Because I'm what? He made a fat joke?

[chuckles, sighs]

[man] He's special.
[Stanley] Special, right?

What's that baby chick about?
Umâ€¦

That's for my daughter, Lucia.

We call her <i>Pollito.</i>
It means little chicken.

So all these are for my mom
and my daughter.

They mean everything to me.

What about your dad?
All these are for him.


She did it.
[Bo] She's good with camera.

She's good. She didn't have toÂ put
her name on yourâ€¦ But that's fine.

<i>Okay. This ain't Europe, baby.</i>

<i>It gets quick here. Offense takes skill.</i>

<i>Defense takes balls, baby. That's right.</i>

<i>Oh! Stop that shit!</i>

<i>Game gets quick! Okay, here we go!</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>- Took the charge!</i>
[Bo] <i>Come on! Hell fuckin' yeah!</i>

So, how do you think you did?

They scored a couple times,
but I think I did pretty good.

Three guys were running at you full tilt
for five minutes straight,

and they scored a couple times.

You crushed it.
[chuckles]

The only thing in your way
is that big brain of yours.

You're sensitive.
I get that. I'm sensitive too.

I cried at the end of <i>Titanic,</i>
but I'm not in the NBA.

You? You can never be soft again.

I'm not soft.
Please.

Kermit, a guy named after a frog,
said some mean words to you,

and you wanted
to take your ball and run home.

It was a trick.
It's never gonna happen again.

Nothing he said bothered you?
No.

Kermit?
Okay, my bad.

<i>I'm</i> over thinking it, I guess.

So, uh, take 20 threes. Every miss,
you're gonna run the bleachers.

[Bo tuts]

Oh, nice.

Nice.

Your mom's a whore.
What?

What?
What was that?

Just said some words. That's it. Hey.
It's not cool, man.

What are you still
standing here for? Let's go.

[Bo tuts]
You know what's not cool?

A grown man letting another
grown man hurt his feelings.

Players are gonna try to get in your head
every time you step on the court.

You gotta be an iceberg out there,

all floating around
and sharp and taking down ships.

When I played college ball,
every time I took a shot,

somebody tried to insult me.
They called me short or slow or chubby.

You know what I did?
What'd you do?

I started passing
'cause I couldn't shoot for shit.

But you don't want my career.

You wanna be Bo Cruz,
All-Star, Hall-of-Famer.

So, let's do this.

Your sweat smells like piss.

Good. Good. Good.

[in Spanish] Son of a thousand sluts.

[in English]
Stanley been working on his Spanish.

Yeah. Right. I looked it up
so I can insult you, my friend.

[in Spanish]
Get fucked by a fish, dumb-ass.

[in English] I love it.
Yeah. All right. Good.

Your mom's not a whore, by the way.
Thank you.

Yeah. Whores get paid.
She gives that fat ass out for free.

[Bo] What?
[grunts]

Come on! We're building a callus!
[laughs]

Get outta here!

Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

[Stanley shouting in Spanish]


Smells good.

What's all this?

Two hundred dollars' worth of Pringles?
These are meals for the week.

Tell him to rinse the containers,
so I can reuse them.

And also, tell him
pornography is free on the Internet.

He's paying for porno?

And who is Paula Serrano?
[grunts]

You've been wiring her $500 a week.
"Paola." Paola's Bo's mother.

They live check-to-check, so I had to.
He's got a daughter to support.

You got a daughter to support.
Right.

Just tell him
to pump the brakes on the Pringles.

At least until the Sixers
start picking up the tab.

Yeah, so I wanna talk to you
about the tab.

[Teresa growls]
It's gonna be fine. Don't worry.

Worry? Why would I worry?

You're just unemployed, spending money
on some man I've never...

He's an investment.
We don't have money to invest.

You told me to quit.

And I meant it until you actually did it.

Now I'm freaked out.
Well, I'm not.

I know what I'm doing.
You'll see. I'll show you.

Yeah, you do that.

[door shuts]

[lock beeps]

[Stanley in deep voice] Hey! Hey! Hey!

Rise and shine, Marine!

[in normal voice] Sorry. Sorry.

Okay.

Stanley, what you want, man?

It's 3:30.

There's two weeks left to the combine.
We gotta get rolling.

What happened here?
Was there something wrong with this?

I told you, just one bite.
On a $40 steak?

You're gonna throw $39 away. I don't know.

Here. This is for you.

What's this?
That's your meals for the week.

My wife made them, so they're healthy.
You can eat the whole thing.

I got a notice from accounting.
Scale back on the room service.

I'm sorry, Stanley. I didn't mean...
No. It's all good.

They also mentioned
they'd love you to stop with the porno.

Porno? It wasn't me.

Then who was it?

Okay, it was me. Fuck.

Get ready. Downstairs.
Five minutes. All right?

We'll have fun,
but we're gonna kick your ass today.

Try not to whack off while I'm gone.

[chuckles]
[door closes]

Okay.

So, what happened to your hand?


It was a freak thing. Car accident.
A long time ago. No more stalling.

Run.

["Runnin'" by David Dallas playing]

Always running.
Go get 'em.

[car horn honking]

Okay.

We'll work on you driving in
and escaping out.

So as you take the cone in
and place it down,

those fans are gonna blow it at you,
so you gotta escape trouble, quick.

Yeah, I know it's tough.

Knees up! Let's go!

Okay. Bring out the big guy.

You gotta work on your precision,
hit small targets out there.

We gotta get right through this.
Don't think about it.

Go, go, go, go.

Down low. Athletic. Athletic. Athletic.

Come on. Yeah.
Let's go. You're an athlete.

Let's turn it around.

Go! Go!

Eh!

It's you against you out there.

And right now, you is kicking your ass.

<i>â™ª They ain't got no muscle, no hustle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No backbone, I stand alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not tripping, just saying
I'm different â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't hanging on the coattails
Of the next man â™ª</i>


Let's go, baby!


Come on! Forty seconds.
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

Low. Low. Low. Low.

Hands and feet work together.
You're thinking too much.

Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Gotta do this in under five.
Remember that.

Come on. Pound it.

Oh!

Run for me. Let's go.

<i>â™ª Get it while I'm living â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I ever hear
Is the clock tick, tick, ticking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm runnin', I'm runnin' â™ª</i>


Get outta the fucking road!

Push it! Catch that prick!

[Stanley groans]

We'll get there.

Let's go again.

The hips low. Yeah. Right. Use that.

<i>Â¡Vamos!</i>
[Stanley] Hey. Let's go.

I don't care about that shot.
It's about the next shot.

And the next shot. And the next shot.

Okay. Yes, sir.

Now, see how he explodes.
Explodes. You gotta explode right off.

Yeah, that's it.

All right.

<i>â™ª Baracus, that BS, that whackness â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Get no play in my axis
Make 'em jump like AJ Hackett â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Guarantee you in these boots â™ª</i>

Come on. Lower the hip.

Feel the fire. God damn it, yes.

Push! Go right through him! That's it!

Track two. Go.
Push this little asshole, come on!

<i>â™ª Music from the soul
Don't need them to help me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If they fiending for the flash
They should take another selfie â™ª</i>

[honks horn]
[Stanley] Yeah!

We're moving forward.
Let's go again, though.

Hard, hard. Nah, you don't have
to put it down so soft.

It'll be okay.

Let's go again. Let's go again.

Let's go. Come on! Come on! Come on!

You're not done.

Pass clean. Pass clean.

Come on, man. Easy.

out of steam, pal!

<i>â™ª Running with them, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They don't wanna give it up
We gon' make it out â™ª</i>

[song ends]

[panting heavily]


He's gotta tell himself.


Come on, man.

Let's go. Back in.
Back in. Back in. Back in.

No stopping. No quitting.
No quitting. Let's go.

Right through. Right out.

Come on. Think about it.
Let's go. Down now.

Right through. Finish that shit.
Whoa! That was nice. Okay.

Switch it back. Getting good, bud.
[Bo] Almost, Stanley! Almost! Cool!

You're getting good. Let's go.
[Bo] Pretty close.


[Stanley practicing Spanish insults]

Ah! You're crispy today, <i>cabrÃ³n!</i>

[Bo and Stanley laugh]

A good player knows where he is on court.

A great player knows
where everybody else is.

Get to it. Get to it. That's it. Go. Go.

To the red. Then to me. Let's pick it up.
You got to be faster.

Look good, man! Cruz-ing!

All right, Bo. You always wanna be low
and have good balance.

Guess who? Attack! Step back! And finish!

[man] Good.
Always staying low.

Stay low. Handle the pressure.
Let's go. Grab that.

You can get more than that.
That's it. Stay strong.

Good. Good. Good.

[Stanley exclaims]

Hey! Be bold, man! Be bold!
[Stanley] Yeah, baby.

Go! Don't stop, baby! Go!

Right through it! And, Bo!

2:01! We're getting there, baby!
We're on the right track. Let's go!

[trainer] Eight, nine.
[Stanley] <i>Â¡Mi roble!</i> Let's go! <i>Â¡Mi roble!</i>

Damn. Smells like a truck full of shit
emptied itself into your mouth.

Nothing affects this young man.
I like that. Hey. Nice.

I'm gonna catch those feet!
[horn honks]

Oh, look how scared he is!

[Stanley laughs]

[motivational music playing]



Got nothing for you.

That's what I'm talking about.


You know how much I love that.
Hard work, baby.

<i>I knew when I saw you.
That's a hardworking fool.</i>

<i>- You're going somewhere.</i>
[Bo] <i>We're going together.</i>


Okay, good. Look around. Who's open?
Be patient. Now! Attack! Go! Go! Go!

Okay, retreat.
Yeah, that's good, man. That's it. Wait.

You'll find times you go down there,
and nothing's open, wait, you'll find it.

You're hot, baby! You're hot.

Bo Cruz coming down!

Low, yeah...
Gotta make passes under pressure.

That's it! Okay, nice.
We're cooking. Last one.

Push it!
Get into the next gear! Go! Go! Go!

Jimmy Butler's up on you.
Now what? Now what?

We're doing this
'cause nobody else is doing this.

Come on! Whoo!

That's it. Back. Pass.

Let's go, Bo.
Finish that. Come on now, Bo!

Good, Bo! Yeah, Bo!
Use that clock! Use that clock!

Find a shooter! That's it! Hit that!

Whoo!

You're ahead, baby! Now!

On your right! Kick his ass!

Leave him in the dust! That's right!

Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!

Yeah! Yeah, suck it, baby!

Go! You're gonna get this!
You're gonna get this!

That's it, brother! Yes, sir!

Minute forty-four
with room to spare, baby! Yes!

The Cruz Missile!

You know you like that!

Look at him go!

That a baby!


We did it!


[Bo] Yeah!
[Stanley] Love it!

[typing on phone]

get the kid more butter.

I mean, it's almost
the whole stick of butter.

[laughing]
Hey.

What do you think
of the Cruz Missile as a nickname for...

The Cruz...
He doesn't like it.

That nickname is stupid.

He says it's stupid.
[laughter]


So, do you have any pictures of Lucia?
I miss her so much.

[Teresa gasps] Aw!

She has your eyes.

Yeah. She does. They're beautiful.

Easy, tiger.

[all chuckle]
No.

So, have you ever been
away from her this long?

I've never been away from her.
Never? Oh, my goodness.

So, anyway, Mrs. Sugerman,
tell me how you met this guy.

"How'd she become so lucky?" He's asking.
Okay. All right. Story time.

So, I was on the women's track team,
and we had a meet at Virginia Tech,

and it was the same time
that the men's basketball team had a game.

And, unfortunately for us,
our bus broke down. Soâ€¦

Mm-hmm. I paid the bus driver.

We had to bum a ride home
with those fools.

Stanley sat next to me
for three hours, the entire ride home,

and he didn't say one word.

I didn't think
she wanted to talk to me. I was scared.

And then, as everybody is walking off,

he just says crazy loud,
"One day, I'm gonna marry you,

and we're gonna have
very athletic children!"

I'm like, "What?"
You really say that?

I did. Yeah, it worked. Right?
Look, I do. We both have aâ€¦

Well, not athletic at all...
Hey! What the heck?

Not even badminton. Not Frisbee.
[Alex] Okay.

Playing checkers, she falls down.

I'm just saying.
[Teresa] Oh, my God.

[Alex] Oh, my God!
That was when you played at Temple?

I played at Temple. Yeah.
How'd you know that?

Come on, Stanley.
You follow me to my home,

offer me, like, crazy money,

you don't think
I'll look you up on Internet?

Number 22. Double Deuce.

Uh-huh!

Somebody did his homework,
unlike somebody else.

Well, Stan can ball.
You do know he can handle the rock.

Stanley?
If he didn't get hurt,

it'd have been a different story.
Who wants coffee?

You want coffee? I'll get coffee.
Spanish coffee, please.

I'll be right back, guys.

[muffled chatter]

[phone rings]

Yo. Leon.
Thanks for getting back so quickly.


<i>you could get it done.</i>

You should've told me about all this shit
before I called all around the league,

<i>vouching for this guy.</i>

Shit. What? What shit you talking about?

<i>He's got an assault charge.
And Vince is all over TV talking about it.</i>

<i>the co-owner of the 76ers, Vince Merrick.</i>

<i>- Vince, thanks for being here tonight.
Thanks for having me.</i>

<i>So, Vince, is it true
the Sixers brought in Bo Cruz,</i>

<i>who has a history of assault,
to play in the combine?</i>

<i>with the 76ers.</i>

<i>He was brought over here by
a disgruntled employee, Stanley Sugerman.</i>

<i>I specifically told Mr. Sugerman
not to bring him over.</i>

<i>He lied to the organization
and to this young man.</i>

<i>Mr. Sugerman's selfish behavior
has been part of his track record.</i>

<i>He's been let go.
He's no longer part of the 76ers.</i>

[door shuts]

<i>Thank you for bringing this story to us.</i>

Hey, Bo. Just get in the car, man.
Let me talk to you.

What are you gonna do?
Walk to Spain? Just please, let me...

You fucking lied to me!
I know.

You lied to me.
All right. He's all right.

I quit my job for you!
You said "trust," and I fucking trust you.

I'm sorry.
You gambled with my life!

It wasn't a gamble. It was a sure thing.
It's fucking over.

You and me is fucking over!
You hear me? Over!

Hey. No. Just stop. Right now. Please.
[police siren whooping]

Don't throw it all away.

I'm begging you, just let go of me.
Get in the car. It's not worth it.

I'm not worth it. Just stop. Okay.

All right. Get in the car.

[officer] Everything okay here?
Hey, guys. Yeah. Everything's good.

When Lucia was twoâ€¦

Her mom, Maria, asked me for her.

She didn't wanna share custody anymore.

I asked her, "Why?"

She told me it was her boyfriend.

He told her they can get money
from the government if she got Lucia.

Soâ€¦

I went to his home.

I swear, I just wanna talk to him.

I know I make a mistake.

But I'm not how they say I am.

I get it.

You don't get shit, man.

You live in your perfect world,
with your perfect family.


One night, after a game at Villanova,
we went to a party.

Me and Leon.

And on the way home, Iâ€¦

I had a few drinks in me.

I looked down at the radio.

When I looked back up,
I saw a telephone pole.

I shot my hand out

to stop Leon
from flying through the windshield.

He still got banged up a little bit,
but my hand was pulp.

I cost Leon and all my teammates
a shot at the NCAA title that year.

I got to think about that.

I mean, really, really marinate in it

for six months in jail.

Everything I worked for.

My whole life.

Everything I wanted.

Gone.

Half the fucking list are favors!

I'm not asking for a favor.
This guy can play!

Everybody keeps saying that. That...

But you don't know the whole story.

He's... Meet the kid!

Just set it up! I'll bring him anywhere!
Anywhere! He'll play anyone!

Will you... Yes. Ryan!

Yes, I know. I know.

And you almost
didn't let Damian Lillard play!

Right! So, you do make mistakes!

Don't make a mistake on this kid.
I'm begging you, pal. Forâ€¦

For your sake, not just mine!

God damn it. I spoke
at your father's camp every year!

And I never asked for anything back! Okay?

So I'm asking you now for something!
Please help me!

[phone clatters]

Jesus Christ!

You know what? I haveâ€¦

Been in this league
for 30 years, and it's like I'm nothing.

[breathes heavily]

It's like I wasn't even here.

Stanley, it's not about the last play.

It's about the next one, right?

That's if you're in the game, T.
I wasn't even in the game.


It's okay.

Hey. Wake up.

You fell asleep in the chair.
[sighs]

Yeah?

Okay.


Hey, Dad, I was thinking...
Just a second, let me finish this.

Stan, you're gonna
give yourself a heart attack.

People just need to see him play, right?
Certain people. Yeah.

Well, remember that video you showed me
of your doctor friend?

[Stanley] My doctor friend?
[Teresa chuckles]

We take the right one home
from the hospital?

He's not a real doctor.

Oh. Well, whatever.

That video has, like, two million views.

I was thinking...
I can't ask him to do that.

Well, I can.

[Stanley] No, no.
[Teresa] No, I'm gonna ask him.

Hey, sweetie. It's T.

[ball dribbling]
[indistinct chatter]

This is gonna be good.


I was hoping you could
help us out with something.

Yo, is that who I think it is?
Yeah, that's Dr. J.

Say "what's up" for my story!

Yo. That's my friend Bo Cruz over there.
They call him the Boa.

You know why they call him that?

Because he squeezes the life
out of his prey.


I got money here.
He's gonna go out on the court.

Somebody gets a shot off him
and can hit the rim,

I'll give you 50 bucks.

If you put a bucket in against this guy,
we'll give you 100 bucks.

If you beat him in a game
of one-on-one to five,

we'll give you 1,000 bucks.
What do you say?

[excited chatter]
I got next.

All right. Let's go.

<i>This kid Bo Cruz is special.</i>

Bo Cruz.
How does it feel getting into the combine?

The combine? I'm in the combine?

You are as of 30 minutes ago.

Have you thought about
what team you wanna play for?

It'd be an honor to play for any team.
I tell you what.

He could be playing
for the Sixers right now,

but Vince Merrick didn't want him.
He specifically said that. You remember?

Anthony, you remember that, right?

You were interviewing him.
That's right.

He's 22. You're messing with his life.

What kind of ballplayer...
Hang on.

Have some respect for your profession.
Get the whole story next time.

What kind of ballplayer...
I'll answer that question.

This guy is as if Scottie Pippen
and a wolf had a baby,

and Lisa Leslie raised him.

And Allen Iverson was the babysitter.


It gets weird, that stuff.
But you handled it great.

What else is bothering you? Tell me.

Nothing. See you tomorrow.

Yeah.

<i>and he's not excited?</i>

He's in his own head.
He's not telling me anything.

[sighs]
Well, maybe he's just sad.

Eh. I think he's overwhelmed.
The pressure's getting to him.

Mm-mm. I bet it's the kid. Lucia.

I mean, he's never been away from her.

People are excited to see
what you're gonna do tomorrow.

Look at this. Look at this.

You think I know that many people?
This is all for you, pal.

That's for us.
Okay, it's for us. Let's get 'em.

Tomorrow, they're gonna be watching you.
Every move you make, the camera's on you.

And it's not just about how you play.
It's the intangibles.

More important than making a shot
is how you handle missing a shot.

Shit's gonna go wrong. So what?

You've dealt with adversity
your whole goddamn life.

Yeah.
[Stanley] It's Bo's turn.

You're nervous, huh?

It's all right.

Hey. Clyde Drexler used to get
so nervous before games

that he'd actually faint.

I'm not kidding you.
The guy did it so much

his teammates followed him around
so they could catch him.

It became kind of a ritual.

It's good to be nervous.
It means you give a shit.

He's got a lot of talent. He's got it all.

He can do a bit of everything.
I don't think he needs any advice from me.

{\an8}Yeah, most guys

{\an8}You're already a lottery pick.
So what's your goal?

{\an8}Just gonna tear it up

<i>Fran Fraschilla here

Bo Cruz and Kermit Wilts
crushed it yesterday,

blowing the roof off
with the speed and agility drills.

I cannot wait for this match-up.

We've been watching Kermit
since his AAU days.

We know he's gonna be an NBA star,

but this kid, Bo Cruz,
he's come out of nowhere.

I thought I knew
every international player on the planet,

but this kid is a revelation.

It'll be a good game.

Of course he's nervous, but I told him
the whole Clyde Drexler

fainting-before-every-game story,
and that calmed him down.

Clyde... That was me who fainted
before every meet, not Clyde Drexler.

That was you? Sorry. Justâ€¦

Either way, it worked.
He'sâ€¦ He's feeling good.

My wife says hi. My wife says hello.

Oh, hi.
Hello, hello. They're excited.

Okay. I love you.

Take him out. Give him a rest.

Stanley, we got it.
You don't have it.


Don't got it. All right.


Where's her mama anyway?
How come she ain't here?

She probably shackin' it up

Tell her to shack it up with me.

I'd be a great stepdad.
Give her a real man to look up to.

Huh? What you got?

Mama, don't.

Look at me.

Don't you see how incredible you are?

You carry this weight.

All that you do for Lucia, for me,

it's never enough.

All this loveâ€¦

And no love for yourself.

When I first saw you hereâ€¦

The day we arrived,

you lookedâ€¦

Different.

You looked lighter,

like the weight was lifted.

And I think that Stanley does for you

what you do for us.

He put all the weight on him

so you can be you.

He is <i>your</i> oak tree.

You can say goodbye
