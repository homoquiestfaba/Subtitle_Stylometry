Come on, let's go.

Go.

Mr. delphino,

Tommy sweeney on one.

Yeah, Roman, it's Tommy.

The safari was a success.

But the launch time has been
delayed five days.

But the launch time has been
delayed five days.

I think now it's time
we renegotiate

the terms of my duty.

Renegotiate?

Yeah.

We should be equal, Roman.

I mean, I want
an equal share of the spoils,

because either of us
could drop a dime on the other

at any time, you know?

Besides,

with five extra days,

we could bag another trophy.

The money's out there,

the money's out there,

walking around in skirts.

So how about it?

Want to?

You ready for another hunt?

Bus number nine
from gatlin, Nebraska

is now arriving in area six.

Excuse me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Hollywood, you from Ohio, right?

Please, no, thank you.

Attention, please.

Golden tours night service

to palmdale, Lancaster,

mojave, bishop Henry

now loading at...

Everything is everything, baby.

That's right, honey.

That's right, honey.

I'm down.

Check this out.

Cute girlfriend walking down
the street.

Detective sergeant teffler.

I just got a tip
you're about to be robbed.

Can't you stop them?

If we catch them in the act,

they're gonna serve real time.

Guess who.

Okay, everyone on the floor!

Face down!

Now!

Down now!

Move it!

Now!

Get that security door open
fast!

Now!

Damn.

The vault.

Where's the safe, asshole?

Move it!

Get it open.

Get it open now!

Come on, let's go! Let's go!

Drop your weapon.

Drop it.

Hands behind your head slowly.

Slowly.

Get back!

Okay, don't anyone move!

You, get down!

Now!

Come on, hurry up in there!

You, you!

Get up! Get up!

Oh, my god.

Hold it!

Get back, man.

I swear to god I'll kill her.

I swear to god I'll kill her.

What are you?

What are you, crazy?

I'll kill her.

Don't take this personally.

I said drop the gun,
or I'll kill her.

I'll kill her!

Verga, verga...

I thought you said
this was your sister.

She is.

She is.

She goes by her married name.

Osterman.

That's it, osterman.

I thought you said she was 16.

No.

She looks 16.

She's really... 18.

Osterman.

She also goes
by the name of Bambi.

Sometimes.

Hey, you heard from the captain?

Hey, you heard from the captain?

Hey, sparks.

You know this guy?

This is sparks Morris.

He's reporting a missing girl.

Yeah, and last month,
it was Darlene.

You cops don't do shit.

What did he say? He was
a human resources director?

This guy's a pimp.

Okay, fine.

We don't count.

We got no rights.

Fine.

Fuck you all.

Hey.

Well, I hear you're back doing

well, I hear you're back doing

your street justice thing again.

You know how it is
on the street.

You know,
you're acting just like

one of those punk kids out there

trying to hustle the corner.

Now, that's not true.

I got a house now.

Sergeant teffler.

Teffler.

I have got lawsuits,

hospital bills,

traumatized witnesses,

public outrage,

just because one
junior detective

can't follow procedure.

I called for backup.
You should have waited!

Hey,
see me about that body work.

Hey,
see me about that body work.

I got a guy who can do it
half price.

You don't get it, do you?

Watch dogs is pressuring me
to suspend you.

Is this the stack on forensics?

Yes, sir, captain.

Good.

Look, you put citizens at risk.

You set up those people
in the store like bait.

Bait.

The bait's what put these
assholes in jail.

Oh, and now you're gonna set
their jail terms.

Hey, would you get me
the Conway autopsy?

Hey, would you get me
the Conway autopsy?

And will you ask your dad
how many cassettes he wants?

I knew I was taking a risk

letting you work alone.

You're the youngest detective
who's ever had that privilege.

Privilege, yeah.

Now, do I have to assign you
to a partner?

No, sir.

Okay.

Okay.

What's this?

Lorenzo fiero, real estate?

Lorenzo fiero, real estate?

My brother-in-law.

Wants to buy your house.

Sell it, kid. Get rich.

Thank you.

Retire.

Merci?

Merci?

Murky?

Merci, my dear.

And who gave you my name,
may I ask?

Mikey.

Did he, uh--

Did he tell you what I like?

Oh, Mikey from Jamaica.

Oh, Mikey from Jamaica.

He used to fly me to Kingston
every week

when I was dating
that record producer.

He wanted to give me
a recording contract,

marry me,

set me up in a mansion.

But I couldn't do that.

I must remain my own.

I must remain my own.

Self-determined.

And I don't take orders.

And I can't abide men...

Who are lazy, cowardly...

Weak.

Hey!

What the hell are you doing?

Tommy.

Your buddies didn't forget.

Happy birthday.

What the fuck?

Hey!

Hey!

Hey, come back here, you bitch!

It's not my birthday!

Alvarez!

Alvarez!

Darling.

Okay.

Hey.

Tommy, you're amazing.

You know that?

You have balls of steel.

But you've got
a good deal going,

an easy scam for big money,

and you're willing
to throw it away

because you've decided
you deserve more.

Knowing the kind of man I am...

I mean,
that's not just ambition.

That takes nerves like lasers.

I saw that once hunting
the white tiger in sumatra.

The sheer willpower of that.

The sheer willpower of that.

Pure.

I mean,

I'm fucking afraid of you,
Tommy.

I know you're pissed,
Roman, but listen.

Just listen.

I always listen to people
I respect.

I am going to make it up to you.

Yeah?

Thank you.

But I'd rather
shoot your balls off.

But I'd rather
shoot your balls off.

I'd rule out suicide.

Powder markings suggest
the use of a sound repressor.

You mean silencer.

You mean silencer.

The only sound would have been
that of his screams

as he expired
from fluid depletion.

You mean he bled to death.

You really love this job,
don't you, Laurie?

I enjoy uncovering secrets.

You know who did this,
don't you?

Someone who was angry at his...

Could a woman get that pent up?

Absolutely.

Sergeant.

We need you outside.

We need you outside.

What do you got there, Johnny,
a phone number?

Okay.
Bag that watch for me, okay?

Mr. Birnbaum.

Ernie. Ernie.

Detective teffler.

Ernie, this woman
that came through tonight--

I don't know anything
about a woman.

Ernie, Ernie, Ernie,

buddy, you already admitted
you talked to this lady.

Ernie, let's say this lady
was a hooker, okay?

Just a theory now.

Let's say this hooker killed
Mr. Tommy sweeney.

That means if you protect her,
my friend,

that makes you an accessory.

That makes you an accessory.

You got that?

But, of course,
there's always the possibility

that she didn't kill him.

She may have just let
that killer into the room.

Now, the only person we know
she talked to before, I mean,

the only one
we know of for sure,

would be you, my friend.

Oh, you've got to be kidding.

No, sir, I am not kidding.

This is no joke.

Now,
either you cooperate with me,

you answer these questions,

or I'm gonna drag your ass
downtown,

I'm gonna stick you in
a room and leave you there.

I might go have some lunch.
I might go--

All right, all right, all right.

She's merci cooper.

She's a regular.

She's a regular.

Who does she work for?

No, she's off the boulevard.

Do me a favor.

This is my number, okay?

You talk to her, you see her,
you give me a call.

I want to get an a.P.B.
On merci cooper.

Check Tommy sweeney's record
for me.

I'm gonna get a search warrant
on this joint.

All right.

You seen sweeney before?
You recognize him?

Nah.

Looks familiar to me.

Listen, the hooker did it.

He probably
tried something kinky,

he probably
tried something kinky,

and she got pissed.

Pissed? How pissed?

Pissed off enough
to kill the guy

and leave a $10,000 watch
on the dresser?

So she shot him
and then panicked.

She used a silencer.

This thing was planned.
She didn't panic.

Check that out for me, okay?
Okay.

Detective.

Merci couldn't have done this.
He's not a killer.

Listen, I hope you're right.

But this chick's
in a lot of danger, okay?

She wouldn't happen to be

in one of these rooms
back here, would she?

You wouldn't happen to have
a search warrant, would you?

You're starting
to get on my nerves.

Just wait.

Go ahead, Dale.
I'm with you in spirit.

Hello, this is merci.

It's sparks.

20 bucks,
and the data involved danger.

Be right back. No shit.

I steered you right before.

When were you left
holding the bag, huh?

Okay, you got it.

The police are looking
for you in the connection

the police are looking
for you in the connection

with the murder
of one Tommy sweeney.

They already got
your beeper number.

You better lay low, baby.

This time you screwed up royale.

Excuse me.

Do you live here?

I'm looking for merci cooper.

Wait! I'm a police officer!

Don't come near me.

It's okay, I'm a police--

get the hell away from me,
or I'll scream.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.

Are you merci cooper?

What's the matter?
What's the matter?

Jesus.

I just want to talk to you.

Here--whoa!

Okay, she's 17,
and she's clean, teff.

Grade "b" student.

Grade "b" student.

Drama club, dancing.

Ten days ago, her old lady
died of a liver ailment.

Three days ago,
her stepdad took her in.

She left.

Skipped school,
cleaned out her bank account,

bought a bus ticket.

No wants,
no warrants, no runaways.

Kid's a virgin.

I doubt that.

No sister? She said
something about a sister.

Nope.

And she's got
to be a virgin liar.

With one street move.

That you never saw before.

Here you go.

Why don't you put these on?

Why don't you put these on?

What? Jail clothes?

Why am I here?

Well, I don't know.

Assaulting a police officer,
resisting arrest.

How was I supposed to know that?

You look like a pervert.

You can change right in here.

Why?

Have you got video cameras
in there?

In your fondest dreams.

So, Kyle, you said that, uh,

so, Kyle, you said that, uh,

merci cooper was your sister,
right?

Yeah, she's my half sister.

Do you--do you know
if she's changed her address

or anything like that?

I don't know.

We haven't exactly
kept in touch.

She sent me a postcard
a while ago.

Could I see it?

Could you leave me alone,
please?

You cops, you think
you can do anything you want.

Especially to women.

Especially to women.

Kyle,

your sister's
in some serious trouble.

She's a professional
Hollywood singer.

No.

She's been doing
a little more than singing.

What's she been doing?

Could I see the postcard please?

Thank you.

Roman's temple?

Roman's temple?

I know this place.

How old's this thing?

A year.

Soliciting
an undercover vice officer?

You want to arrest her?

Sergeant.

You think my sister's a hooker?

Sergeant, are you insulting
this poor girl?

Yeah, he is.

And would you please tell him

to keep his hands off of me?

Look, let's just go.

Thank you.

Tommy sweeney's record.

Used to be a bouncer
at Roman's temple.

Used to be a bouncer
at Roman's temple.

Check it out.

Well, we--we picked
her up for vagrancy.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

I understand
that you're her stepfather.

Yeah, yeah, I'm her step-father.

Uh-huh.

I married her mother
4 1/2 years ago.

Terrible thing.

She's been nothing
but a pain in my side.

She's been nothing
but a pain in my side.

She doesn't listen to me--

Well, see,
it's required by the law

that we notify you.

Yeah, I'm glad you notified me.

Keep her out there.

She never listens to me.

She never listened
to her mother.

It's like this kid's
got a mind of her own.

Excuse me.

Where's the women's room?

Right next to the fire exit.

Thank you.

Do me a favor.

If she goes anywhere
or she takes any calls,

you let me know?

Don't worry about her.

She'll be fine so long
as she doesn't run away

like you used to.

What are you gonna do?

Roger, control, this is--

I need it.

I want it.

I want it.

I want it.

Ooh, baby.

Come on, baby.

I think we should
get horizontal.

I want it.

I think we should
shed some skin.

I can feel you beating faster

and faster.

Maybe now I'll let you in.

I need it.

Ooh, baby.

I need it.

She's quite a trophy, isn't she?

I picked her up
off the streets of Chicago.

I catch people like butterflies.

Hi.

I'm Roman.

Kyle.

Bradley.

I'm looking for
my sister, merci cooper.

She wrote me that she used
to sing here a while ago.

She wrote me that she used
to sing here a while ago.

Oh.

Well, won't you have a seat,
Kyle?

Now, while you're
hunting for your sister,

I'm gonna try hunting you.

I like to give women
a fair warning.

Within 48 hours,
I'd say I'm gonna have you.

You'll probably come to me.
If not, I'll find you.

You'll probably come to me.
If not, I'll find you.

I'll catch you,

mount you like a butterfly,

and then sell you
to a collector.

I'll probably start
the hunt tonight.

So you've got
a few hours' head start.

You really think
you're hot shit, don't you?

Well,

women remind me
of a kind of macaw

I've heard in the Amazon basin.

They say it can screech
so loud it can kill itself.

That's stretching it
a little bit,

that's stretching it
a little bit,

don't you think, there, romy?

I mean, the closest you ever
come to high adventure

was smuggling
a little dope and porno

out of the back of a stolen van.

Long time, no see, teff.

She's underage, Romeo.

I thought you said
you didn't know anybody in L.A.

You want to experience
the street life? Beat it.

Why don't you go find
your sister

and tell her
I'm looking for her.

Sounds like you're
in a bad mood.

Tommy sweeney's your bouncer.

Yeah.

He was killed last night.

Oh, god.

That's terrible.

I knew he was losing it.

He started shooting up.

That kid's sister was there.

The motel Caribbean?

Oh.

Tommy liked rough stuff.

S&m.

He liked the tunnels of love.

He liked the tunnels of love.

You still own that shit hole?

So who's this chick
who killed Tommy?

Oh, no.

I don't think she did it.

I think she saw it.

Doesn't it make you tense

always digging into the streets?

You know, you're a little nuts.

What was Tommy
doing for you lately?

A little bodyguarding.

What else do you know
about his sex habits?

Oh, I think he liked
a little bit of everything.

Hey, you know, you've
got to start working out.

Cut the shit, man.

Cut the shit, man.

If you're in the middle
of this, I'll know.

Yeah, well, let me tell
you what I know, huh?

I know two street kids

who used to shoplift
and shake down

and eat and run
and dumpster dive

till we were old enough
to sell blood.

You remember those days,
teff, huh?

I owed you one.

I just paid you back
with a warning.

Hi.

I dance too.

I mean, amateur, but...

Um,
I was just talking to the owner.

Roman. Do you know him?

I sleep with him.

It's not the same thing.

It's not the same thing.

Oh.

I'm sorry. I--

I just wondered
how I could get a job here.

Sleep with someone.

Honey, Roman eats candy
like you every week.

If you want to play with him,
you've got to have some backup.

What's this I hear?

I was just telling
your girlfriend

to go back to her mall.

48 hours, remember.

Hey, kels, do me a favor.

Run a financial check
on Roman delphino.

I need everything,
his taxes, his holdings,

the works, okay?

I'll get back to you.

Damn.

Get that hooker merci in here.

Hey, man,

you will not be hurting her.

Not if like you said
she didn't see shit.

Not if like you said
she didn't see shit.

Merci. Merci.

You shouldn't be
out on the streets.

You can't work dates now.

How are you gonna
pay me my 20 bucks?

Sparks.

Sparks, you know,
this is karmic,

because, you know,
I was just saying to someone

that sparks Morris is the only
real gentleman on the boulevard.

Do you remember
that Italian count

that wanted me to headline
at his club?

Sure, sure. What's not?

Pardon me? What do you need?

Pardon me? What do you need?

A place to stay.

Nonproblem.

Honey,
you were meant to live in Rome.

Checking my finances?

Well, how deep
can a police sergeant dig?

Yeah, okay, do that.

Thanks.

You're in trouble, aren't you?

I'm fine.

Now I got to fucking
take it from you too?

I was offering sympathy.

Jesus, Roman.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I dress the way you want.

I'm sorry. Come here, baby.

Never mind.

You kill the mood.

You're always killing the mood.

And your desk is a mess.

Dr. Carlisle,
mark on line for you.

Hello, mark, you're on.

Hello? Hello?

Yes.

Is this Dr. Carlisle?

Yes, this is Dr. Carlisle.

Hi, my name is--I'm nervous.

That's all right.

It's the first
time I've called in.

Well--
Can I help you?

Actually,

do you need anybody to sweep up
or wash dishes, huh?

Do you need anybody to sweep up
or wash dishes, huh?

How old are you?

I'm 17.

Go on. Get out of here.

Okay.

Remember, your address
has to be current.

Remember, your address
has to be current.

Where'd that girl go?

She took off that way.

Fucking bum kids.

All I got are skates.

All I got are
her goddamn skates.

Everybody thinks
they're so fast.

Well, I'm faster than everybody.

Watch this.

That's fast.

Want some?

Don't ever offer
your food to anybody, okay?

Don't be nice.

Come here.

Come here.

I'm a collector, you know?

I just enjoy getting
something for nothing.

But I'm on probation,

so you really
saved my ass back there.

I won't forget it.

Anyway, you remind me
of me when I first got here.

I was raped twice.

You know, if you get desperate

and you need a place to hide,

you go to the L.A. county
drug rehab center, all right?

You go to the L.A. county
drug rehab center, all right?

Remember that.

L.A. county drug rehab.

Okay?

Free room and board,
tightest security.

What, like cops?

Like if some guy won't
leave you alone and he's armed.

Oh, but they only take
smack addicts.

So what you do,
you get a needle,

and you poke little holes
in your arm.

You've done that?

Honey, what the hell did
you think you'd find here?

I'm gonna be a dancer.

All right, look.

You want a job?

Yeah. Of course. I mean, I--

No, not of course.

A job at minimum wage
won't get you off the boulevard.

You bust your ass all day,

eat a decent meal,

then you go back to sleep
on the pavement.

What are you doing?

See these wires?

See these wires?

Yeah.

That's what I'm doing.

Is this your car? Yeah.

Lost the keys last year.
Real pain in the ass.

Are you serious?

Look, check this place out.

Tell 'em pizza girl sent you.

I did a favor for the manager.

Want a ride?

You're stealing this,
aren't you?

You're stealing this,
aren't you?

You heard him.

He's got my wheels.

This is what I call
opening negotiations.

Dancing foxes song-a-gram?

Get the girl.

Get the girl.

Scare off teffler.

Do it quietly.

You got that?

Girl, teffler, quietly.

Get out of here.
I got work to do.

Excuse me.

Hey.

Do you want
to take something off,

or you've got something we
haven't seen yet?

I'm looking for merci.

I'm looking for merci.

Aren't we all?

Merci cooper.

It's been a while for you,
hasn't it?

Open up, open up.

Can you smell that?

Excuse me.

You little peckerhead.

Just having some fun.

Take a pill, dude.

Just let it go, okay?

Hey, we paid for her, huh?

Hey, we paid for her, huh?

Who the fuck
do you think you are?

The fuck do you think
you're doing with my wife?

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Let's go, dear.

I forgot my clothes.

Could you please go get them--

No, no. No, no, no, no, no,

I'm not going back in there.

Those guys are pissed off
and plastered.

I can't believe this.
You know what?

I should arrest you
for your own good.

You've got a real
love-hate relationship

with women, don't you?

There's no love involved here.

Then what are you doing here?

I don't know.

I'm looking for your sister.

She used to work here.

Listen, she's not wanted
for prostitution, okay?

She's a suspect for murder.

She's a suspect for murder.

Maybe she didn't do it.

Maybe she was only a witness,
but she was at the scene.

I'm sorry.
I don't make this stuff up.

But if you know where she is,
you better tell me.

Come on. Talk.

I think it takes a sick kind
of mind to want to be a cop.

You want to see sick, huh?

You want to see sick, huh?

Out! Get out!

This is Annie.

It's okay, Annie.

She's a real professional.

How old do you think she is?

All of 14?

Everybody out!

Out! Everybody!

You against the wall.

Meet your future blow job.

Think you're gonna
be different, huh?

Maybe gonna find a nice job
somewhere, Beverly hills.

Maybe gonna find a nice job
somewhere, Beverly hills.

Sansell's from Malibu.

Let's see those arms.

Come here.

I'm clean.

Okay, the shoes,
take off the shoes.

I want to see your feet.
Take off the shoes.

Okay.

I'm gonna be sick.

You say that again,

because that's exactly
what I did.

Oh, come on,
you're distracting me.

I got a business
to run here, you know?

You know, just give me
one more day, Roman.

I'm gonna get this squared away.

Hey.

Sister say no.

Sister say no.

See this badge?

This means
you have to open the gate.

Sister say no beds.

Great.

Could you just tell the sister
it's for--for one night?

We just need one bed
for one night.

That's it.

Thank you.

Thank you.

I think it's impressive.

Yeah.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Kyle, listen, I'm sorry. No.

Okay? It's the only bed in town.

She just died now,
right now in the same--

In the same bed?

Not just now.

Kyle, listen, it's--I'm sorry.

You're telling me that--

Listen,
would you just do this for me?

I mean, we've been
driving around for hours.

Please.

Oh, my god.

Listen, when I find your
sister, we'll come back,

and we'll pull you
out of the place.

I promise.

But just do me a favor, okay?

The house mother's waiting.

Thanks.

Just behave yourself.

Don't bother.

This is your place?

Hey, really,
I feel safer on the street.

Condemned look.

I like it.

You're very funny.

You're funny.

Would you like some
milk and cookies?

The hamburger was enough.

Are you sure
you're not still hungry?

I'm sure.

Okay.

Hey, you got a message.

Can I listen?

Uh, detective sergeant teffler,

this is lorenzo fiero,
captain woods' brother-in-law.

I believe he mentioned me
to you.

Look, I've been trying
to get ahold of you

about your house.

Could you please give me
a call at 555-4929?

Mr. teffler, this is
shelby tuttle once again.

We have a buyer
willing to offer you $500,000

we have a buyer
willing to offer you $500,000

for your house cash.

Hey, you're gonna stay here,

you got to learn
something first.

No shit.

Like just how weird
you really are?

What, just because I'm
gonna turn down $1/2 million?

You like that.

Get out of here.

What do you mean,
"hard to find?" She's a hooker.

Me asked all over town, man.

I don't like this.

Why is she hiding out
if she's got nothing to hide?

Just fucking find her, okay?

Hey, teff, do you have a towel?

Hey, teff, do you have a towel?

Towel.

Towel's right out here.

I already called
the halfway house.

You guys are my last resort.

Well, could she maybe just,
I don't know,

share a room with somebody
for the evening?

Okay.

Okay. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you.

Jesus.

Hey.

Look, I'm sorry. Look, I'll go--

No, no, I--I mean,
you got--I apologize.

You're a handful.

You're a firecracker.

Yeah.

That's what my stepdad said
last week

when I moved in with him.

I got out of there right quick.

What do you mean?

What do you mean?

Listen, could you just
cut out the strip tease act?

That's it. Please.

Thanks a lot. Good-bye.

Good-bye? Where are you going?

What, are you gonna go sleep
in a gutter somewhere, huh?

Well, you don't have anything.

You don't even have
the clothes on your back.

Then take the fucking
clothes on my back.

I don't need anything from you.
You want them.

I don't need it.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Come on, baby.

Come on, baby.

I think we should
get horizontal.

I want it.

I think we should
shed some skin.

I can feel you beating
faster and faster.

Maybe now I'll let you in.

Duane Winchester.

He's a biochemist.

He lost his wife and
his only son in a car accident.

Basically went around
with a permanent broken heart.

Basically went around
with a permanent broken heart.

He picked me up. I was starving.

He treated me like a son.

Pretty much the closest thing

I've known to having a father.

This is the closest thing
I've known to having a home.

Teff,

am I just, like,
your social work for this week?

You can try some
of the old lady's clothes on

in the closet, but you got
to sleep on the couch.

No!

No!

Kyle.

Kyle, hey.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

It's okay.

You're having a dream.

It's okay.

You're okay here.

Come here.

It's okay.

You had a bad dream there.

You had a bad dream there.

You're all right.

Wow.

I wish you were
another year older.

Would a year
make such a difference?

You're gonna be different.

In another year, you're
gonna be a different girl.

In another year,
I'll be a woman.

You'll be even
more scared of me.

Come on, hey. Hey.

Kyle, come on.

I know what
you're going through here.

King 26, talk to me.

Control, this is baywatch 26.

I have made visual contact.

What is she doing now?

Looks like she's gonna
be crossing Hollywood boulevard,

and right now, she's bumming
change from some guy.

Do you have any idea
how many unwritten laws

you've broken this week?

You've broken this week?

Now,
I know it's your private life.

But if you've
harbored a witness,

it could blow
a whole felony case.

Don't take the bullet on
personally, teff.

Ah, shit.

Did she eat something?

Yes. She's washed up.

That's pretty good
for a bag lady.

I want to dance.

Professionally.

I could give you that.

I want a contract,
and I want a down payment.

I want a contract,
and I want a down payment.

Jeez, what,
you got an agent already?

And I don't want to get screwed

like you screwed my sister.

Did you ever find her?

Yeah, I found out a lot--

A lot I could tell
my friend, the cop.

You think
I'm some silly little girl?

You think I haven't seen the
14-year-old pros shooting up

or the Johns driving in
from Malibu for a blow job?

Or the Johns driving in
from Malibu for a blow job?

I underestimated you.

So?

Do we open negotiations?

Sure.

Why not?

Sure. Why not?

Tell you what.

Tell you what.

Why don't you go first?

Hmm? Why don't you start?

You know, you are quite
a catch, you know that?

You're full of shit.

You know, I've always loved
a woman who could piss me off,

'cause then I know
I'm not taking advantage of her.

She's going home now.

Would you please go away?

That gun's a big mistake.

I'm gonna sting your ass.

I'm gonna give you just
enough rope to hang yourself,

and then I'm gonna
put you away for life.

You want to know
why you hate me so much?

Yeah, I do.

Let go of me!

Who the fuck tipped him off,
huh?

No, I swear.

I swear.

What did he shoot you with, huh?

I am fine.

Did he have a name for it?
What did he call it, huh?

I'm fine. He give it a name?

Would you quit
trying to save me?

Come on.
Let's go to the hospital.

You're the one who's bleeding.

Come on, let's go.
Get in the car.

Son of a bitch.

Girl, we've been
looking for you.

Mikey, darling, I am hurt.

I want you to know
I am seriously offended.

What you talking under?

I trusted you.

And you--you haven't
given me a chance to sing,

and now you've put me
in a very bad position

with the police.

With the police.

You come inside.

Me get you a drink.

Me make it all better, huh?

I'm not going anywhere with you.

I want you to honor
our friendship.

Me do everything me can.

You come inside.

No, listen.

I have to leave for Paris.

There's a photographer there
who offered to pay my way.

However--
Please. Jah.

Look, me loan you money.

You just come inside
with me now.

No.

I'm on the run, damn it.

I'm on the run, damn it.

I would appreciate a loan.

Thank you.

What were you doing
with that asshole?

I don't know.

I guess I'm just a little
too young to know any better.

You're old enough
to know better.

Am I?

You know, by the way,

you know, by the way,

I don't have this love-hate
relationship with women.

Of course you don't.

I mean, I may hate
some of the things they do,

but I don't--
I don't hate them.

I know.

You know, if you didn't
keep running away from me,

I wouldn't have
to keep saving you.

Yeah.

I really hate it when people

keep running away from things.

On your mark...

Get set...

Sweet, sweet.

Sweet.

Me late.

Late, late, late.

I don't know why I hang out

with such an unsavory character
as you.

The men who killed Tommy sweeney

are probably out to kill me now,

the police are ready
to arrest me,

the police are ready
to arrest me,

I am totally without funds,

and I must flee
for my life tonight

under the cover of darkness.

Or you could sing a set.

Some record people
will be there.

Hmm?

Hmm.

This is Lee teffler.

I'm not in to get your call,
so leave a message.

I'm not in to get your call,
so leave a message.

One king 89, come in, please.

Hey, teff, it's me, kelso.

Come on, answer.

I got something for you.

It's about
the Tommy sweeney case.

Hey, kels, what's happening?

Hey, that pimp you know, sparks?

Well, it turns out he's been
charged in the past

for kidnapping.

Seems like some of his
street girls have disappeared.

This may be the guy we're after.

No, no, no,
that doesn't make sense.

Why would the guy cut off
his own income

and then come into the station
to complain about it?

Hey, I just report the facts.

You figure it out. Teff!

Kyle?

Teff?

Teff, you there?

Let go!

Would you let go of me?

â™ª I know what you mean â™ª

â™ª When you say
your mountain dream â™ª

â™ª Don't include me â™ª

â™ª Don't include me â™ª

â™ª But I'm not the one â™ª

â™ª Who's always turning green â™ª

â™ª When someone else
comes around â™ª

â™ª I know what you mean â™ª

â™ª When you say
your mountain dream â™ª

â™ª When you say
your mountain dream â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª You got to fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Put your feet
down on the ground â™ª

â™ª Fly down in me â™ª

Want to play?

Take it off.

â™ª But a time's gonna come â™ª

â™ª When you don't
get up and run â™ª

â™ª When you don't
get up and run â™ª

â™ª From the one who
keeps you warm at night â™ª

â™ª Yeah, pull yourself aside
and I'll take you for a ride â™ª

That's so much...

Right.

Better.

â™ª Honey,
you're just changing space â™ª

â™ª You got to fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Put your feet
down on the ground â™ª

â™ª Put your feet
down on the ground â™ª

â™ª Fly down in it â™ª

â™ª Won't you fly down in it? â™ª

â™ª Won't you fly down? â™ª

â™ª Won't you go down? â™ª

Here, move this way.

Goddamn you!

â™ª You got to fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Put your feet down
on the ground â™ª

â™ª Fly down in me â™ª

â™ª I'm halfway there
to the opening sound â™ª

Roman, she got away.

She was just here,
but she got away.

â™ª When you don't get up
and run â™ª

â™ª From the one who keeps you
warm at night â™ª

â™ª Now give yourself a sign
and I'll take you for a ride â™ª

â™ª You don't lose me, you know â™ª

â™ª 'Cause time's not far
when you've been flyin' high â™ª

â™ª And I'll be standing
on the ground â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Hey,
you got to fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Put your feet
down on the ground â™ª

â™ª Put your feet
down on the ground â™ª

â™ª Fly down in me â™ª

â™ª I'm halfway there
to the opening sound â™ª

â™ª Fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, listen to me now â™ª

Find her.

â™ª Honey,
you're just changing speeds â™ª

â™ª Oh,
you got to fly down in it â™ª

â™ª Put your feet down
on the ground â™ª

â™ª Fly down in it â™ª

â™ª I'm halfway there
to the opening sound â™ª

â™ª Fly down in me â™ª

â™ª Fly down in it â™ª

â™ª Why don't you
fly down in it? â™ª

â™ª Won't you fly down?
Won't you come down? â™ª

â™ª Won't you come down? â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

Wha...

â™ª To the ground â™ª

â™ª Won't you get yourself
on down? â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

Shit.

Shit.

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

Help me!

Get your hands off of me!

Merci.

Merci.

Whoa.

Jah, peace, brother.

Beat it, man.

I be gone, man.

Let's go. Let's go.

Okay.

Get to the station.

The bus station?

No, the police station. Go!

You asshole!

Get the gun!

I got him.

Paul!

Shit!

I didn't do it.

But it was stupid.

I thought it was
a birthday joke.

And they think you're a hooker.

And what do you think?

I always knew you were a singer.

What are you doing?

Get in the car.

Goddamn it.

Damn it.

Okay, you go to the bus station.

Get the hell out of here now.

I don't have any place to go,
merci.

No, you don't.

I do.

She's my dad's sister.

Vera cooper.

She lives in--
In de soto, Arizona.

Merci, no.

I cannot leave you now.

Please.

I'm glad you saw me sing.

Yeah.

Me too.

Look!

Oh, my god, they found me.
Let's go.

Go, go, go!

Hey, get out of the way!

Do you see anybody?

No.

I got to go.

You wait here a couple
of minutes and then take off.

I'll meet you
at the bus station.

Don't.

You'll be okay.

I can tell you can
take care of yourself.

Boulevard teaches you fast,
doesn't it?

Hey.

Don't even think about it.

You got your warrant.

You got your warrant.

You got a material witness
out there.

Hey.

How much more do you want?

They're shipping
a girl out tonight, kelso.

I've been in his office.

You got to arrest him first.

I'm gonna catch him in the act.

We're gonna make it
stick this time.

Shut up.

You don't want the captain
to hear you.

No, we nail him,

and we put this guy away
for life.

No, no, no.

Kels.

I need backup, man.

Man, you're putting
lives at stake.

Man, you're putting
lives at stake.

Don't you want to get
away from your desk?

Teff, I'm not an action person.

I am sorry,
because you're going.

I got to have somebody there
I can trust.

You think about
your daughter, man.

He's got girls just like her
on the street.

Except there's a certain one
I got to protect first.

Hey.

Hi.

Good for free pizza,

if you ever decide to come back.

Here you go.

This just doesn't
seem right to me.

This is absolutely right.

This is absolutely right.

You'll be safe.

I feel like I'm deserting her.

I'm--I'm deserting you.

Starlight express service
bus number 46

now loading for Phoenix,
flagstaff,

Albuquerque, Oklahoma city,

and Kansas City.

I got to get out of here.

You're staying.

You're in on this.

What?

Kels, give me a break.

Roman's got
some inside information.

He's got police records,
police files.

I know it's you.

Hey.

If you knew how long
I wanted out of this--

Yeah, everybody wants out, pal.

You don't. You love it.

You don't. You love it.

All it ever did
was make me more in debt.

Then why didn't you
get another goddamn job?

I did.

Working for this piece of shit?

You got a wife.

You got a daughter.

Hey, don't give me that shit.

You got a girlfriend,
and she's underage.

You know what they're gonna do

when they found out
about you downtown?

Nothing.

'Cause cops don't lose
their badge over this shit.

They lose their badge
over shit like this.

Come on. Come on.

Teff!

I know you're out there!

That's Kyle.

Oh, shit.

You knew about this,
you son of a bitch?

No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.

Teff, I told you you'd be
putting lives on the line.

Not this life.

Not this life.

You think
if I start fucking with you,

he'll come out in the open, huh?

Scream.

Scream!

Scream.

Go to hell.

Scream!

Get your men back on the boat.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Teff!

Get moving.

Move it!

Go.

Go.

Go.

Do it right,
or I'll do it myself.

Come on, you fucking punk cop!

That was the sound
of my man's gun.

My man again.

Something tells me
you'll be leaving soon.

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Carlo!

Is it over?

Shit.

It's over.

Let her go.

Want to trade?

Trade what?

Information.

What you know, who else knows,
what's your cost.

Come on, teff,
everybody's got their price.

Put it down first.

You first.

You're a psychopath.

Then don't take me
personally, huh?

Then fuck her!

Then fuck her!

Okay!

No!

Are you okay?

I thought we were finished.

So did I.

Let's go.
