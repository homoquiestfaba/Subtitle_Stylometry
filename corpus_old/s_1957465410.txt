Hey, everyone.

I'm Abby Walker
and I am so honoured

to have been selected
to perform tonight

here at the Emerging Artists
Christmas Showcase.

I wanna play a song for you
that I wrote recently.

It's a Christmas song called
"Christmas Without You".

I hope you like it.

It's an Abby Walker
original.

(clearing throat)

â™ª Mmm, mmm â™ª

â™ª There's always
somethin' special â™ª

â™ª About this time of year â™ª

â™ª Snowflakes falling 'round â™ª

â™ª And people spreading
that Christmas cheer â™ª

â™ª Lights on all the houses â™ª

â™ª A magic feeling
in the air â™ª

â™ª It'll be
a perfect Christmas â™ª

â™ª Just a long
as you are there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª Forget about the holly
and the mistletoe too â™ª

â™ª Stockings hung with care â™ª

â™ª Won't matter
if you aren't there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª I know there is a reason â™ª

â™ª Why I'm all lit up inside â™ª

â™ª Maybe it's deckin'
the Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª With you right by my side â™ª

â™ª All year round
there is one thing that I know â™ª

â™ª Like the star
upon the tree â™ª

â™ª Baby, you glow â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª Forget about the holly
and the mistletoe too â™ª

â™ª Stockings hung with care â™ª

â™ª Won't matter
if you aren't there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª Oh, Christmas isn't
Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª Christmas isn't Christmas... â™ª

Without you.

(applause and cheering)

Thanks so much!
(phone notification dinging)

Abby: You all have been
so awesome.

Man: Bravo!

(soft music playing
over stereo)

I loved your song.

Thanks so much.

You have an amazing talent.

Oh my gosh.

You're Casey Macey.

The Casey Macey, the superstar,
likes my song.


My label's looking for
a Christmas single for me.

Maybe we could team up
and write something?

Uh, yeah! I'd love to.
Of course.

It would be an honour
to work with you.

Wow.

Set it up with my manager.

â™ª

Abby: So, have you heard
from Casey's manager?

It's been what,
over a month now?

I'm sorry, honey.

They never got back to me
about a meeting,

but that's the way
things are in the biz.

There'll be
other opportunities.

Well, you think we could
send my song out to labels?

Or maybe someone else
is looking for an opener?

Abby, I've been trying
to pitch you as an artist

all over town
for almost a year now.

No one's responded yet.

But, I do have
a ton of offers

for you to write songs
for commercials.

Commercials?
Like advertisements?

It's a booming industry.
Very lucrative.

You'd be perfect.

What do you say?
I don't know.

Writing commercials
seems a bit soul-killing.

I'm an artist.

Well, I know
it's no Casey Macey,

but um,
it's a good living.

And you need to pay rent,
right?

I guess I could try.

McKayla?
Yes?

Brenda: Email Abby
those commercial gigs.

Oh, and make me a smoothie.
You know what I like.

We'll be in touch.

(music playing over radio)

â™ª There's always
something special â™ª

â™ª About this time of year â™ª

What is that?

I think that's
Casey Macey's new single.

It's catchy, huh?

That's my song.
I wrote that song!

Well, I know a lot of these
Christmas songs sound similar,

but no,
I think it's different.

Casey Macey stole my song!

â™ª As long as you are there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas isn't
Christmas without you â™ª

â™ª Forget about the holly
and the mistletoe too â™ª

â™ª Stockings hung with care â™ª

(music continuing from phone,
phone vibrating)

â™ª Won't matter
if you aren't there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas isn't
Christmas without you â™ª

Whitney: Whoops!

(phone vibrating)

(music stopping)
Sorry.

Love that song.

And I can
take that call later.

(clearing throat)

Anyways,
Seventh Heaven paper towels

are the softest
in the market.

We know that.

We just need our audience
to know that. So Abby,

if you could be sure to write
some lyrics about softness,

maybe some absorbency,

that'd be fantastic.

But focus on the softness,

because people love
soft paper towels.

(people murmuring agreement)
Sure, no problem. Softness.

Mission statement,

good for everyone,
affordable...

(Casey singing)
â™ª Lights on all the houses â™ª

â™ª A magic feeling
in the air â™ª

â™ª It'll be
a perfect Christmas â™ª

â™ª Just a long
as you are there â™ª

(music over speakers)

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

I hate this song.

What? It's so catchy!

You used to love
Christmas songs.

I still do, but this one just
reminds me a little too much

of something I wrote.

How's the songwriting going?
It's not.

You know, I'm pretty busy
with work these days.

Ugh, Abby, you're so busy
with these commercials

that you're never gonna have
time to focus on your own songs.

Whitney, I am writing
this commercial for you.

Is this your way
of firing me?

Of course not.

But at this point,
I'm more concerned for you

as a friend
than a coworker.

Commercials aren't
where your heart is.

You don't even sing them
for us anymore.

I mean, when's the last time you
performed in front of anyone?

I can't remember.

When I first met you,

you had these big dreams
of being an artist,

of releasing
your first Christmas hit.

What happened?

I guess I just haven't been

in the Christmas spirit lately,
you know?

Well, you haven't been
in the Christmas spirit

because you don't have
any Christmas decorations

at your house.
I have a tree.

Well, it's tiny, it's busted,
and your mother sent it to you.

Maybe you should go home
for the holidays.

You're always telling me
how well your hometown

does Christmas.
No, I can't do that.

I have to turn in
this paper towel song,

got one
for a hardware store,

a frozen yogurt commercial
that's due.

Maybe going home
will inspire you

to write
your own songs again.

Whitney, I am perfectly capable
of writing a Christmas song

without going home
to Bellville.

â™ª Without you â™ª

â™ª I put gifts
in your stockings â™ª

â™ª For when you awake â™ª

â™ª I even â™ª

â™ª Decided to make you.... â™ª

â™ª Fruitcake â™ª

Oh my gosh. Agh, so bad!


(phone dialling, ringing)

Cynthia on phone: Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom.

I think I will come home
for Christmas this year.

â™ª

â™ª

I can't believe you're here!
I can't believe it either!

Hey, Mom!

I'm so glad you're back.
I'm happy to be back.

Oh!

And I'm staying
for a few days.

You can let go.

Do I have to?
(chuckling)

I got all your favourites
in the kitchen.

Come on, come on.
Take your coat off.

Great to be home.

(Cynthia giggling)
Okay, Mom,

I love you but
you're smooshing me again.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Here.

Have some hot cider.
Thanks.

Nice slippers!
What are those, polar bears?

Mm-hm. Don't worry,
I got you a pair too.

They're in your room.

Perfect.
(chuckling)

So, how long you staying?
Just through Christmas.

Oh. You sure you don't
wanna stay longer?

They are looking
for a co-director

of the music department
at my school.

Mom...
You'd be perfect.

..I have a whole life
in New York.

I know, I know.

Abby: I see you bought
more ornaments?

I don't think you could
possibly fit

any more Christmas decorations
in this house.

They're for the annual
Christmas pageant.

I'm in charge this year.

Oh. Being principal
isn't enough work?

Well,
it's kind of a big deal.

It's our school's turn
to host the whole ceremony.

Oh, nice!
Speaking of school,

you should swing by
and maybe check out

the old stomping grounds?

I think I will.
Mm-hm?

I'll bring sandwiches.
That sounds great!

â™ª

(school bell ringing)

Hey!
Oh! Whoa!

There goes lunch.

Oh, uh...

Um... (sighing) Sorry.

It's okay.
I wasn't hungry anyway.

Starving.

Okay. Hey, are you
the new sub?

Huh?

Can you watch my class
for a little bit?

I got a bit
of a tuba situation.

Uh, I don't work here, Sir.

Sorry, but good luck
with your situation!

Cynthia: Yeah, um, if you could
just come down to the school...

Where do I sign in?
Hi. Go over there.

Oh, thanks.

Hi, honey. Take a seat.

Sorry about that. Yes.
Two o'clock would be great.

Thank you. That would
be great, superintendent.

I really look forward to
speaking to you about the...

All right.
Let's hurry this up, Ethan.

I gotta get back
to my students

that actually play
their instruments in class.

I'm telling you, Mr. Tucker,
you can send me

to the principal's office
all you want,

but it will not make me enjoy
playing the triangle.

Who says
you have to enjoy it?

You just have to hit
two pieces of steel together.

And not text in my class.

I wasn't texting!
I was reading.

What were you reading?
Kerouac.

Hi, honey.

Okay, I love Kerouac.

Right? The sense of freedom?
Possibilities.

It's like...
it's like an adventure.

Okay, so,
what did you do this time?

He was reading in music class.
Oh, better than texting.

What can I say?
You guys won't let me graduate

without taking
an arts elective.

Please come in.

Honey, I'm sorry.
Can we reschedule?

Duty calls.
No problem.

The sandwiches
got ruined anyway.

But I have a lot of work
to do, so.

You should work
in the music rehearsal room.

One should be free.

Maybe I will. Thanks!

See you at dinner, Mom.

Travis, Linda called
about the set decorations

for the pageant?
Mm-hm.

And Sandra dropped these off
for you. Costumes.

You'll have to decide
who's wearing what.

Fabulous.

Good luck!
Thanks.

Perfect.

Okay.

Where to start?

â™ª Soft as a daydream â™ª

â™ª Gentle to touch â™ª

â™ª I never knew
I could love you so much â™ª

â™ª You absorb all my spills â™ª

â™ª No matter how large â™ª

â™ª You're all that I'll use

â™ª When I have a discha... â™ª

Oh, no. That's...
That's not right.

Um...

â™ª You absorb all my spills,
no matter how big â™ª

Am I... hearing things

or did you just do
an ode to paper towel?

I'm Travis.
I'm the band teacher.

Your voice is lovely,
by the way.

Oh, thanks. Yeah, I write songs
for commercials.

Really?
That's an interesting job.

Thanks. It actually
keeps me pretty busy.

So, if you don't mind...

So, you make a living
songwriting

without even having to write
real songs?

Oh, no, oh, no.
I didn't mean...

You know what I mean.

I don't, actually.
What exactly do you mean?

Uh, I guess I'm saying
that your music is more...

marketing than art, right?

And I suppose you're
a pure artistic musician?

(phone notification dinging)

I like to think so.

Oh, it's from your mom.


"Talk to Billy
about the lighting

"and sound system
for the pageant."

Well, sounds like
you have your hands full

of purely artistic
musical tasks.

I'll leave you to it.

TouchÃ©.

â™ª

So, what's the deal
with that guy?

What guy, honey?
The band teacher, Travis?

Oh, isn't he great?
He just started this year.

He seems kind of rude.

Oh, he just
has his hands full.

He's juggling the whole music
department by himself right now.

And his class is performing
the tree ceremony.

Hope he can handle
the pressure.

Oh, I'm sure he'll be great.
He used to teach

at one of those fancy performing
arts schools in New York.

We're lucky to have him!

Wow. If he taught
at such a fancy school,

why'd he come to Bellville?

I think his dad retired here and
he wanted to be closer to him.

You know,
you could do the same thing.

Mom.
We could see each other

all the time and no more
back and forth from New York.

That'd be very nice, but
you know my job is in New York.

I had to try.

â™ª

We could continue
this conversation later,

but my vote's fairly set.

I know you care
about the arts program,

but the way the budget's
lining up,

it just might not make sense
to keep it.

I really hope we can change
your mind, superintendent.

Have a good day.

Hey, Mom.

Thought I'd try again
with sandwiches.

Hey, honey.

Everything okay?

Uh...
Oh, Travis.

Hi.
Hey.

Hello, Travis.

How's the song for the pageant
coming along?

"Deck the Halls"
is one of my favourites.

It's good.
It's good, yeah.

Um, although, I still have
to sort the set decoration.

And the lighting.

And the costumes.

It would really help if we could
fill that co-director position.

Abby,
you'll fill in, right?

What? Mom, you know
I'm super busy.

Yeah, no.

I meant fill the position
down the road.

I mean, I can handle it.

Well, I wasn't gonna
mention this,

but we just got
some terrible news.

What's wrong?

I just found out
that the school board

is thinking about taking our
performing arts funding away.

Oh, no!
Why would they do that?

They wanna give the money
to sports.

They get most
of the money anyway.

The superintendent
is just one of those people

who doesn't see
the value in arts.

That's terrible.
Yeah. The problem is,

the board takes most
of their voting cues from him.

They're voting right after
the Christmas pageant.

Okay. So,
here's what you're gonna do.

You have to make this
the best pageant ever.

You have to convince him

the students need
these arts programs.

So you'll help, right?
You'll fill in?

Just for now.

I mean, I guess an extra hand
couldn't hurt, right?

Please, honey.
We really need you.

Please,
it's only temporary.

Okay. I'll do it.
I'll help.

Thank you.

Travis: Good.

(birds chirping)

I can't believe
I got roped into this.

Whitney on phone:
Yikes.

Sounds like a mess.

So, tell me more
about this guy.

Abby: What guy?
The band teacher!

What's he like?

He's whatever.

He's all over the place.

Is he cute?
(woman squealing nearby)

What? No!

I don't know.

He's adequate.
Mmm, he's "adequate".

(glass shattering nearby)

I'm not talking
about this anymore.

(people shouting,
music playing)

Um, I have to go
deal with this.

The employees get a little nuts
during these Christmas parties.

But I'm sorry
you're going through

what you're going through.

It's okay.
Thanks for listening.

Good luck tomorrow, okay?
Thanks. I'll need it.

Awesome.
(glass shattering)

Hey. Hey, you!


â™ª

Everybody, we have a very
special guest joining us today.

I would like for you
to welcome Abby Walker.

Hi!
Kids: Hi.

Travis: This is
Principal Walker's daughter.

And uh,
she's gonna be helping us out

for the next few weeks,

just before the tree ceremony
performance.

Now, she writes music
for commercials,

so she knows
what she's doing.

Really? That's cool.

Would you sing us one?

Oh, no.
(nervous chuckling)

It's been a while
since I've sung for anyone.

I heard you singing yesterday
and you were great.

Yeah, sing for us.

Students:
Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing!


Okay. Fine.

Uh, how about this one?

Um, let's see.
(plays single note on the piano)

Okay.

â™ª When you know
it's time to go â™ª

â™ª Time to leave it behind â™ª

â™ª When you say
it's been a day â™ª

â™ª That you just
can't define â™ª

â™ª They'll be there â™ª

â™ª Always caring â™ª

â™ª To carry you through â™ª

â™ª 'Cause your best friend
won't leave you â™ª

â™ª And neither will Chew â™ª

(applause and murmurs)
Girl: Wow.

Wow.

Your voice is incredible.

That was actually moving.
That's a commercial?

Yeah, for the dog food ad?

Uh, with the golden retriever
and the kid?

Oh, yeah!

You should sing
for our performance.

Yes!
(kids murmuring agreement)

That's a great idea.
It would really impress

the superintendent
with your singing.

Oh, no. I don't think so.

I don't want to take away
from you guys.

Oh, you wouldn't be.
I mean, I feel like

it would really
bring everything together.

(kids agreeing)
Enough about me.

How about I hear
your performance song?

You heard the woman.
You ready?

Let's show her
a bit of what we got.

Ugh.

Really, Ethan?

Sorry.

One, two, three, and...

(band playing "Deck the Halls")

â™ª

Excellent.

You guys are getting better
every day.

What do you think?

It sounds amazing!

Yeah?
Absolutely.

May I make a tiny comment?

Be my guest.
Okay.

You guys sound really good,

but I can tell
that you're trying so hard

to make everything perfect

that you're not really
feeling the music.

Well, there's nothing wrong
with perfection. Right?

Well, the audience
won't notice technique

but they will notice if the
music makes them feel something.

But, proper technique
is important too.

You need to have
a solid understanding

of the fundamentals of music if
you're gonna be any good at it.

Sure!

But if you get bogged down

with too much of that stuff,
it's going to feel like school.

Yeah, well, this is school.
Right?

All I'm saying is that,

you know,
if you just relax a little

and try to feel the music
in your heart,

your piece will really soar.
Like your commercial soared?

Kids: Ooh!

Oof.

Dude.

You know what?

You're the one
who wanted my help.

No, I...

(door closing)

Nice one, Mr. Tucker.

You really know
how to charm the ladies.

(kids chuckling)
Thank you, Ethan.

Abby: I was right.
He is so rude.

I don't know why I'm doing this
if he's just gonna insult me.

He probably didn't mean anything
by it, honey.

Well, he basically
called me a sellout.

Well, are you passionate about
those commercials you write?

Not really.

You're such a great singer
and songwriter.

I don't know why you stopped!
Did something happen?

Nothing happened,

I just got busy with life,
that's all. You know?

I'm an adult. It happens.

It doesn't have to happen.

Well, I'm just glad
tomorrow is Saturday.

I'll be happy
not to see Travis.

(chickadee chirping)

Abby? Abby.
Oh, no.

About yesterday.
It's the weekend, Travis.

I'm trying to do
some Christmas shopping?

I know, I just thought maybe
I could buy you a coffee

and apologise properly?
That's really not necessary.

Please?


Fine.

I didn't know
what you wanted,

so I just sorta got
one of everything.

Well, if you're trying
to bribe me with sugar,

you're off to a good start.

Okay, let's see
what we got here.

I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

That's an understatement.

I've just been
really overwhelmed

with this whole
performance thing and um,

I took it out on you
and I'm sorry.

Whatever, it's fine.

So we can start over?

I'm Travis.

I'm the music teacher
at Bellville High School.

Seriously?
Just go with it.

Hi, I'm Abby.

Nice to meet you, Abby.

My class has
a very important

Christmas pageant performance
coming up.

The whole department's kind of
counting on it going well,

and I could really use
your help.

What do you say?

Travis, I've already agreed
to help.

Fine!

I would be happy to help.

Thank you.

And again, I'm, uh...

I'm really sorry
that I insulted you.

Apology accepted.

'Cause really, um,

I'm quite impressed by you,
actually.

Really?

Yeah, you're chasing
your dreams.

You make a living
off songwriting!

Right.

Thanks.

Truce?

Truce.

So, I'll see you there
on Monday.

I'll be there.

Perfect.

So, your turn.

All three.

Is that a part of the truce?
Yummy.

(band playing)

Okay, guys.
I wanna try something

a little different today.

Instead of practice
we have free period?

No, Ethan. Not that.

I got some logistical stuff I
gotta do for the performance,

so, Abby is gonna take over
teaching today.

(kids reacting)

What?

Yeah, what?


I think we could use
another perspective.

We do want this performance
to be perfect, right?

Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I need to take over.

Yeah, with all due respect,
Mr. Tucker,

we don't have
that many practices left.

We can't afford
to just waste time.

Travis:
It'll be great, okay?

And I will be right over there,
so all of you...

listen to what she says.

Okay?

Okay. Um...

Well, now that I have
your attention...

Let's see. Uh...

Can anyone tell me what the
number one rule in music is?

Come on, anybody.

Um, what's the number one rule
in music?

Yes, uh...

Travis:
Yeah, Lila.

Tone?

Tone? That's good.

Uh, any other ideas?

Yes.
Pitch?

Pitch, okay.

That's also good.

Anyone else?

Uh, rhythm?

Rhythm, all right.

So, these are all
very important,

but the number one rule in music
is there are no rules.

What makes a great musician
is listening.

Their ability to listen
is everything.

And you need to listen
to what's around you, okay?

You have two ears, one mouth,

so you should be listening
twice as much as you're playing,

and you should be having fun.

But shouldn't we
practice the song?

Well, you can practice
and have fun.

There are many ways
of practicing and improving

at the same time.
And, you know,

one great way to practice
and have fun

is to play with
your favourite songs.

But we're not playing our
favourite song for the pageant.

Yes, you're right.
You're not.

But still great ear training.

And you need to train your ears
so you can trust your ears

and train your ears
to trust your intuition.

And that will make
the difference

between a bad performance
and a great performance.

That all sounds cool,

but I don't see
how we can do all of that

in time to get the perfect song
for the performance.

Well, it doesn't need
to be perfect.

You just need to make
the audience feel something.

Okay?

So, let's give it a try.

And a-one, a-two,
a-one, two, three, and...

(band playing "Deck the Halls")

Feel the music!

Close your eyes
if you need to.

(band playing mechanically)

(band playing swing version
of "Deck the Halls")

â™ª

(trumpet playing flat note)

â™ª

Excellent!
Yes, guys. Yes!

That's what we're talking about.
Girl: That was awesome!

Abby:
Living in the moment.

Feeling the music!

Hey, Abby.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hey.
Hey, Travis.

What do you say
we have lunch together?

I... it's Caputo's.
You got me.


And you bought coffee too!

Can we talk about
how you were a natural back there?

What were you,
a teacher in a past life?

I actually used to give
music lessons on the side

when I was in college.

I really loved it, actually.
Yeah, I... it shows.

So, how are
the commercials going?

You don't really care
about those, do you?

Um, I mean, I do.

It's just, uh,

I guess,
what I really wanna hear

is something that you've written
that you care about.

Well, there's this one Christmas
song I've been toying with.

But...
Okay! Well, there you go.

Sing it for me!

(clearing throat)

Okay. Um...

â™ª Silent night
filled with music now â™ª

â™ª And each moment's like
a Christmas wish come true â™ª

â™ª Even though
choirs are singin' â™ª

â™ª Their songs
of joy and praise â™ª

â™ª My favourite
Christmas Melody is you â™ª

Wha?

Abby, that was beautiful.

I want, you know, just a little
bit more time to work on it.

I just haven't gotten to it.

I've been so busy serenading
people with... sandwich bags.


Well,
I think you need to make time,

because it's really great.

I mean, I'm impressed.

Oh, please.
I'm impressed!

Well, I don't know. Whatever.
I'm serious!

You get paid
for writing songs.

It's a lot more
than I've ever done.

I used to have a... a dream
of being a composer, but...

Really?
Yeah, yeah.

But I never swung for it.

It always seemed
like too much of a risk.

Well, it is a lot of work,

but it's never too late
to reach for your dreams.

No. No.

Well, I'm not exactly pursuing
my real dreams either, you know?

Well, what are
your real dreams?

To be a musical artist.

To sing Christmas songs
like the one I just showed you.

Okay, I love that!
Why aren't you doing that?

Well,
my official excuse is work.

But, honestly, I just haven't
been really inspired lately.

I only have that one verse.

Well, what's holding you back?

I'm not sure.

I just thought
coming back here

would spark
or light a fire under me,

get that
Christmas spirit back.

It's just...
nothing's worked so far.

Okay, I see now.

You just need
a little Christmas cheer.

Something like that.

Well then...it's a good thing
that we're hanging out

because I don't know
if anyone told you

but I'm kinda like the king
of Christmas around this town.

The king of Christmas, huh?
Oh yeah, big time.

That's a pretty big statement

considering you live
in Bellville.

Yeah.

We are like "the" capital
of Christmas here.

Mm-hm.
You're not even from here.

Well, why do you think
I moved here?

I thought you moved here
for your dad.

Well, no, I did.
You're right.

But I mean, the Christmas thing
was a huge draw!

You know what?

I am gonna make it
my personal mission

to help you get back
your Christmas spirit.

What?
Yeah.

Why?

Well, take it as a thank you
for helping me with class.

And how exactly
are you gonna do that?


I'm not sure yet.

But I will do it.
You just wait and see.

Whatever you say.

â™ª

Hey, baby.
Hey, Mom. What's all this?

I'm stringing garland to help
decorate for the tree ceremony.

You wanna help?

Oh, I'd love to but I was just
about to get back to work.

Oh, okay.

That's okay, baby.

You know what?

I can take a break.
Yay!

So, how are the kids sounding,
co-director?

Temporary co-director.

I'm just saying, you'd fit in
really well around here.

I like having you home,
honey.

I like being home, Mom.

Is this butter?

Stop eating the decorations!

Travis:
Remember what Abby taught you.

Listen to what's being played
and feel the music.

(Band playing jazzy version
of "Deck the Halls")

â™ª

â™ª

Very, very nice, guys!

I really feel
like Abby's suggestions

really helped out on that one.
What do you think?

It was amazing.
Right?

Oh, yeah.

But Ethan, bud!

You look bored to tears!

(students chuckling)

We want to show
the superintendent passion.

There must be something
about music that you like.

Have you tried
any other instruments?

The pageant is next week.

We don't have time to be adding
new instruments into the mix.

Okay, well, wait.
I mean, Abby could be right.

Maybe it'll make
the performance better.

We won't know
until we try.

Well, are there any other
instruments that you wanna try

or others that you played
and actually liked?

I mean, I've played
a little piano before.

Okay, great!
Uh, show us what you got.

It's okay.
Just play what you can.

(Slow, soft jazz version
of "Deck the Halls")

â™ª

(adding flourishes)

(surprised chuckling)

â™ª

(song ending)

Ethan,
you can play the piano!

A little bit.

What?! Are you...

That's incredible!

Why didn't you tell me
you could do that?

I don't know! I guess
I never really thought of it.

Um...

I just didn't see the point.

It's not like I'm gonna
do anything with it anyway.

Why would you think that?

Ethan: I already know
what I'm doing with my life.

I'm taking over
my family's restaurant.

There's no reason
you can't do both.

Just seems like a waste of time,
I guess.

I have to do cooking classes,
business courses.

You have to play
in the Christmas pageant.

Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

You won't have to
play triangle anymore.

Deal.

Wow.

I swear, these kids
surprise me every day.

No kidding.

So I was thinking, uh,
what are you doing tonight?

Tonight?

Nothing. Why?

Well, I did promise
that I would help you

get your
Christmas spirit back,

and the music room
is missing a Christmas tree.

Ah! You wanna decorate
a Christmas tree together?

Yeah, why not?
I mean, the kids'll love it

and I'm assuming you haven't
done one this year yet?

Try five years.

All the more reason!
So, what do you say?

Music room at 7:00?
Okay. Let's do it.

Okay.

Ooh, is this a date?

What? No!

It's just a Christmas thing.

Enjoying the season
or whatever.

It just seems like
the two of you

decorating a tree
alone at night,

it kinda seems
like a date to me.

Well, it's not.
Oh.

He is single.
And kinda handsome?

You want me to start hounding
you about your love life?

Absolutely not.
Thank you.

Bye, Mom. Love you!
Love you, sweetheart.

Have fun on your non-date.

(Casey singing on radio)
â™ª Mm â™ª

â™ª It's always
something special â™ª

So, is this your personal
tree decorating playlist?

Yeah, it's got all the modern
Christmas classics.

I can't help myself.

Well, you are the king
of Christmas, after all.

And don't you forget it!

Oh, I love this one.

â™ª As long as you are there â™ª

â™ª Christmas isn't Christmas
without you â™ª

â™ª Forget about the holly â™ª

â™ª And the mistletoe too â™ª

Come on,
sing it with me.

â™ª Stockings hung with care â™ª

â™ª Won't matter if
you aren't there â™ª

â™ª 'Cause Christmas
isn't Christmas without you â™ª

Come on, sing it!
I'm good, thanks.

Oh, come on!
You're no fun.

Come on,
you're my Christmas apprentice.

You must do as I say!

Look,
I don't want to, okay?!

â™ª All year round â™ª

Ugh, my gosh.
I didn't mean to snap.

The song is fine, I just...

No, no, it's cool.

I'd uh... I'd lash out too
if I had to listen to me sing.

Maybe we need
a cookie break.

You know,
get my blood sugar up.

I think I'm just hangry.
All right. Yeah.

Hey, did you bring any of your
mother's ginger snap cookies?

You bet I did.

Oh, I think
you just saved Christmas.

I may or may not have some
hot cider stashed around here.

Ooh, you just levelled up!
Come on.

Phew.

Here you are,
your cider, Madam.

Thanks.
It's hot.

So, you've been
holding out on me.

What do you mean?

You can sing.

Ah-ho!

I thought you said
you were a composer.

Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

I actually wrote a verse
for that Christmas song

that you showed me
the other day.

I hope I'm not imposing.

No way!

Of course not.
Well, I'm not as good as you.

I should probably just leave it
to the professionals.

Don't be silly.

I'd love to hear it sometime.

Yeah?
Yeah.

How 'bout now?

All right, I'm uh...

a little nervous
showing you this,

but uh, I mean, it's probably
gonna be terrible.

Play it for me!

All right.

Here's the new verse
that I wrote.

â™ª This December
could last a year â™ª

â™ª I'd be happy and I'd still
be wantin' more â™ª

â™ª With the fire
here before us â™ª

â™ª And winter's quiet hum â™ª

â™ª Still my favourite
Christmas melody is you â™ª

That sounds good.

I know it's your song,

and I don't wanna edge in
on your creativity, I just...

you said you were stuck
and I thought maybe

some additional lyrics
might help to spark something.

Well.

"With the fire here before us
and winter's quiet hum."

That's poetry.

I love it.
Really? You like it?

No, I love it.

You know, you keep trying to
put yourself in the background

but you really deserve
to be in the spotlight.

I could say the same
about you.

I wrote
"Christmas Without You".

I'm sorry?

That Casey Macey song?

That's why I reacted
the way I did

when we were
decorating the tree.

What do you mean, you wrote...

I mean, that would be amazing.
It's a super big hit.

Well, for her it was.

She heard me sing it
at a showcase.

She even said she wanted
to collaborate with me

and then she decided that she
really didn't need me after all.

Are you saying
that she stole it?

I couldn't really prove it.

My manager
hired a lawyer and...


...just,
she said there was nothing

that we could even do
about it legally

because of
the copyright laws.


I mean, it's no wonder
you lost your inspiration.

That's horrible. I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

You know, I've never
told anyone that story before.

Well,
your secret's safe with me.

Thanks.

Well, this new song,
it just needs a chorus

and I was thinking maybe
you could write it with me.

Really?

Yeah!

I'd love that, yeah!

Um, I mean,
I'm free tomorrow.

I mean, unless you have a date
or something like that.

Oh no, I don't.
But if you do...

I don't.

Uh, it's getting pretty late.

So...

we probably better get going.

Yeah. No, it is late.

Yeah.

Yeah.

â™ª

(band playing swing version of
"Deck the Halls")

â™ª

Travis:
You guys are killin' it!

Abby:
Not this. Not this.

Definitely not this.

I have nothing to wear.

I thought you were just
writing a song together.

What does it matter
what you wear?

It doesn't. I just don't wanna
look bad, you know?

Mm-hm. You like him.

What? No.

Don't lie to me.

Whitney.

Abby.

(doorbell ringing)

He's here. I gotta go.

Hey.

Hi.

I brought these.

You brought me flowers?

Um, they're for your mom,
actually.

Oh.

Did I hear "flowers"?

Travis. Thank you.

If you'll excuse me,

I have about a billion cookies
to cook for this weekend.

You want some help?

I thought you guys
were writing.

No reason we can't do both!

Oh, well, I'd love the help,
honey. Thank you.

Sorry this isn't the easiest way
to write a song.

Oh, I don't know. Maybe
it'll be an innovative new way

of unleashing
our creativity.

It feels like old times
and I'm a giddy child.


Wait, that sounds good.

Let's remember that.
Hmm.

Or maybe something like...

â™ª And Christmas lights shine â™ª

And...

â™ª And I can't help but...

â™ª Keep on basking in you â™ª

That's really special.

Write that down.

And then
we slide up like this.

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

All right. Well, uh...
Yeah.

â™ª

(soft chatter under music)

I can play a C a little...
Yeah.

(chuckling) Okay.
Yes!

â™ª

â™ª Still my favourite
Christmas melody is you â™ª

â™ª Hmm â™ª

Oh my goodness.

Gosh, it's so good!
Ah, it's so good.

I think
we should send it out.

What, like to labels?

Yeah, is that crazy?

I think it's too good
to keep to ourselves.

I have a friend
that I went to high school with

who works at
a management company.

I... I could reach out.

Maybe we should send it
through my agent Brenda.

It'll be more official.

Perfect.

Yeah.

(composing text)
Let me know your thoughts.

Think we have a winner.

(phone notification dinging)

There. Sent.

Wow. Oh!

I CC'ed you, so you have a copy
of the recording too.

Awesome.

What if she doesn't like it?

How could she not like it?
It's objectively incredible.

Is it?

Look,
even if she doesn't like it,

you're still more impressive
than 99% of the people out there

that don't have the guts
to follow their dreams!

And we made an amazing song.

So no matter what,
we always have this.

You're right.

Besides, there's no way
she won't love it!

Oh, I can't wait for us
to get in the studio

and record this next
big Christmas hit!

Right? I...

"Us"?

Yeah, you're my partner,
right?

Partner?

I mean...yeah.

Partner.

Yeah!

Ooh, I just love
that song you were singing.

You two work well together.

(band finishing song)

Guys, we are lookin' so good
for this performance!

I wanna mix it up
a little bit.

Don't you think
we should keep practicing?

The pageant's in three days!

We've practiced enough.

I want us to loosen up
and have some fun.

Said no winner ever.

(students chuckling)

All right,
we're gonna try a new song.

It's called
"A Christmas Melody"

and Abby and I wrote it.

(students' impressed reactions)

You guys wrote this?

Mm-hm.
Ethan: Cool.

Oh, yeah.

So, you can
take one yourselves

and pass one
to the row behind you.

Sorry the sheet music
is handwritten

but take it home,
give it a try.

(school bell ringing)

Okay. Your homework
is to practice this new piece

and we'll take a look at it
next week, all right?

Girl: Okay, thank you!
Boy: Thank you, Sir.


So, had an idea.
What's that?

Gingerbread houses.

Mmm.

I found some kits
in my mom's pantry.

I like
where your head's at.

So, this evening?
Uh, my house?

I'll be there.

Cool.

Good work, everybody.
Thank you.

Boy: Bye.
Girl: Bye.

Oh, Ethan.
Hold back a sec.

What up, Mr. Tucker?
Travis: I've been thinkin'.

I think you should apply
to the Powell School of Music.

The one in New York?

Isn't that like,
really hard to get into?

Yeah, but I know
the admissions coordinator.

I can put in a good word.

Look, I'm not going to college.
I told you.

I'm taking over
my family's restaurant.

And that's a very noble plan,
Ethan.

Look, I've been there.
It's delicious.

But is that really
what you want?

I mean, is playing the piano
even a career?

Absolutely.

I mean, you could play
in an orchestra.

You could score films.

You could work
as a session musician.

You could even do commercials
like Miss Walker.

Uh, I don't know.

Ethan,
you are so talented, okay?

You can't waste that
in the back of a kitchen!

I mean, it would be pretty cool
to play music for a living.

Right?
All I'm asking is you apply.

Okay? You just make
the audition tape

and you can decide
if you wanna go later.

If I make a tape,
will you stop bugging me?

Never.

I will never stop pushing you.

Fine.

All right! Good. Let's go.

Right now?
Yeah!

No time like the present.


So, what do you think,
"Deck the Halls"?

I mean,
it's not very original.

Can I do you
and Mrs. Walker's song-

"A Christmas Melody"?

I'd be honoured.

â™ª

(phone ringing)

Brenda! What did you think
about the song?

Yeah, Abby, about the song.
What is this?

Did you like it?
I have a new musical partner.

Abby,
it's a Christmas song.

Christmas is
a very competitive market.

I know, but the song
is really good,

so I think it'll stand out.
Sure.

I'll send it out, see if
there are any takers. I just...

I don't know why you're wasting
your time with all this stuff.

It's not a waste of time,
it's...

How are the commercials
coming along?

I have a ton more corporate gigs
you should be working on.

McKayla, email Abby
the corporate gigs.

You know, I was thinking maybe
I should put a pause on those.

What? Are you crazy?

I'm feeling really inspired
with my own songs right now.

I may even start
performing again.

Abby, you're at the top
of your game.

If you quit now, someone will
come in and take up your spot.

Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

Okay. All right, just...
don't say I didn't warn you.

Abby: I won't.

Thanks, Brenda!

I know you just want
what's best for me.

Uh-huh. Sure.

Okay, bye!

Travis: I feel like I need
more sprinkles.

Ooh. I'm missing a gumdrop.

I don't have
any of those left,

but I do have a candy cane
I can spare.

I'll take that.
No.

I need
those jellybeans first.

You drive a hard bargain,
Travis Tucker, but a fair one.

There we go.

Oh, by the way,
I spoke to Brenda

and she's gonna
send the song out.

Really?
Mm-hm.

Things are happening.

And I quit the commercials.
I thought you should know.

You did?
Yeah.

I wanna focus on singing
more Christmas songs with you.

I personally think
we make a great duo.

I do too.

And, since I have
a little time on my hands,

I was thinking
I could stick around

for a few more weeks
in Bellville.

Well, that's great!

I mean,
we could write another song.

Maybe we could try
to perform at a coffee shop

or something like that?

Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

(phone ringing)

Um...shoot.

I should take this.

Take it in my room.

I'll make us
some hot toddies.

Okay, thank you.

Travis through door: The song's
called "A Christmas Melody".

It's amazing, okay?

You're not gonna
believe your ears.

No, I swear.

No, I have it
on my phone right now.

We already submitted it
through more official channels

but, if you want, I could
send it to you right now.

Okay.

Yeah. Just a sec.
(clearing throat)

(composing email)

Okay, it should be
in your inbox now.

Thanks. I mean,
this could have a big impact

and I really appreciate
you giving it a listen.

Oh, um,

do me a favor
and just keep this between us.

You know, I don't want anyone
to know that I did this.

Well,
you know how people are.

Especially musicians,
yeah.

No.

Hey, thanks again.



All right,
hot toddy time!

I think you should leave.

I thought we were doing
gingerbread houses.

Mine's finished.
Goodbye, Travis.

Are... are you for real?

Okay. If that's what you want,
I guess I'll see you in school.

I can't believe
this is happening again!

This is exactly the reason
why I left the business.

People are just so ruthless
when it comes to getting ahead.

Even people in Bellville,
I guess.

Oh, honey,
I'm sorry he did that to you.

What a jerk.

Who woulda thought?
I wanna come back to New York.

But what about your mom?

Isn't this performance
important for her?

Yeah.

Her school arts funding
depends on it.

Then you can't leave, right?
No.

Ugh! I'm just so mad!

Okay. You are gonna
get it out tonight.

Channel it into a song
and tomorrow,

you are gonna
pull yourself together

and you are gonna move on.

You got this, babe.

I know.
Thanks, Whitney.

You sure
you're gonna be okay?

Yeah.

I just really liked him,
that's all.

Whitney:
I know you did. Goodnight, babe.

Thanks again. Bye.

â™ª I thought you were different â™ª

â™ª But you're all the same â™ª

â™ª I wasn't special â™ª

â™ª It's all a game â™ª

â™ª It's all about you â™ª

â™ª You, you, and your â™ª

(phone notification dinging)

Ugh.
Cynthia: Abby?

Abby, is everything okay?

I just wanna check in.

I... I'm fine, Mom.

I just had a private call,
that's all.

Hmm.

I'm gonna ask again.

Is everything okay?

It's fine.
Just work stuff.

Okay, well, I'm making Christmas
fudge for the pageant

if you wanna help?
Might make you feel better.

Uh, I think I'm gonna pass
if that's okay?

I'm just not really in
the Christmas fudge mood.

Of course, honey.
I'll save you some?

(playing keyboard chords)

â™ª Red's not your colour â™ª

â™ª And you smell like a shoe â™ª

â™ª You act like you're perfect â™ª

â™ª And your jokes are bad too â™ª

Abby.
Abby, where have you been?

I've been calling you nonstop.

Well, I only came here
to drop this off.

You left it at my place.

Wait,
what's going on with you?

Hey, Miss Walker.

Uh, we didn't see you
at practice today.

Everyone missed you.

I'm sorry, Ethan.
Something came up.

But don't worry,

I'll be there tomorrow
at the tree lighting ceremony.

I wouldn't miss your big debut
for the world.

Do you have any tips
about stage fright?

I didn't think
I'd get this nervous.

Oh, you'll do great!

But if you do get a little
nervous, just, you know,

close your eyes like I said
and get lost in the music.

It always works for me.

Okay, thanks.
I'll try it.

See you later, Miss Walker.
See you soon!

Okay, wait. Abby!

(phone ringing)

Brenda! Uh, did someone
respond to the song?

Actually,
it's me, McKayla.

There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

Abby:
Oh, hey, McKayla. What's up?

Abby,
I just thought you should...

Is that Abby?

Abby,
I'm so glad you called.

Uh, you called me.

So, I sent your song out

and usually we hear back
within a day,

but no one's interested
so far.

I'm so sorry, Abby.
Oh.

But the corporate gigs are still
available if you're interested.

They really want you back,
Abby.

They said
they'll double your pay.

Great.

So, what do you say?
Back in with the ads?

Sure. Why not?

Guess sometimes you just have to
accept the things you're good at

and the things you're not.

Thattagirl.
You won't regret this.

I'll have McKayla send over
the paperwork straight away.

So, we need to set up meetings
as soon as possible.

Can you come back tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

I have a tree lighting
ceremony performance.

Okay,
what about the next day?

Christmas Day?

No, sorry, that's right.

Offices are closed. Um...

So, let's do the 26th.
First thing in the morning?

I guess I can be back then.

I just have to leave to go back
to New York on Christmas Day.

Ah, perfect.
You won't regret this, Abby.

You know, you can't take
opportunities like this

for granted.

It's very lucrative,
for all of us.

Yeah. Right.

Thanks, Brenda.

You're welcome, honey.

(music playing over radio)

Abby.

Ugh. Again?

Are you following me?

It's the only cafe in town.

I don't have time for this.
Whoa, Abby.

Can you talk to me?
What's going on?

Is this about the song?

What do you think it is,
Travis?

Oh, by the way,
everyone rejected it.

Oh, I'm sorry, that's...

that's disappointing.

Yeah, well, maybe you'll have
better luck as a solo act.

Huh?

Look, I'll be at the ceremony
tonight but I'm leaving tomorrow

so you don't have to deal
with me anymore.

What, you're leaving like
you're going back to New York?

Yeah.

But I thought you were staying
through New Year's.

I've got work to attend to
in New York.

Okay.

I'll see you tonight though?

Yeah. I'll be there.

â™ª

And now for your
next performance,

please welcome the Bellville
Middle School Youth Choir.

(applause and cheering)

Guys, you got this, okay?

We've been practicing this song
for months,

you know it like the back
of your hands.

It's gonna be amazing.
(murmurs of agreement)

(choir singing "Deck the Halls")

What is that?
What am I hearing?

What are they...

â™ª Fa, la-la la-la â™ª

â™ª 'Tis the season to be jolly â™ª

â™ª Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la-la â™ª

â™ª Don we now our gay apparel â™ª

They're singing
"Deck the Halls".

They're supposed to be singing
"O Little Town of Bethlehem".

It's right here
in the program.

Yeah well, they must've
switched last minute.

Um, Mr. Tucker?

We have a bigger problem.

What's wrong?

Ethan's missing. I may have
spooked him out a little.

Lyla, what did you say?

Nothing! Nothing.

I just reminded him
that the entire arts program

is counting on him
performing perfectly tonight

and that if he messes up,

generations of
Bellville High students

will miss out on
the joys of music forever

until the end of time.
Lila.

We have to find him.

Okay, everybody.
We gotta split up.

Some of you go check
the classrooms,

some of you
sweep the hallways.

Abby and I will check
the music room.

What about our performance?
We're next.

Well, we're not going on
without our piano player.

Lila, you stay here

and, I don't know,
stall them.

Oh, okay.


Do you think we should
call his mom?

I mean,
where could he be?

Oh, you're speaking to me now?
No more baseless accusations?

I heard you going
behind my back, Travis.

What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything.

You were trying to take
all the credit for our song.

What?! You really think
I would do that?

I don't know what you would do,
but it sure seems like it.

You're so bitter about your past
that you can't trust anyone.

Actually, it's just
the untrustworthy ones

that I can't trust.

â™ª Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la-la â™ª

(cheering and applause)

Man: Isn't that great?

(mic feedback)

And now for our final
performance of the evening,

please welcome
the Bellville High School Band.

(applause)
Woo!

(soft crowd chatter)

What do you mean,
he's missing?

Can't Abby play the piano?

Well, they're all gone now.
So...

This is bad.

Yeah.
This is very, very bad.

Travis: Ethan!
He's gotta be in here.

Abby: Ethan!
There he is.

Ethan, are you okay?

What happened?

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucker.

I don't wanna let you down
but I can't do it.

Of course you can do it.
You were born for this.

What if I mess up,
lose the school's funding?

It's just
too much pressure.

You're not gonna mess up.

But I could.
How do you know?

We'll all take
a two minute break, folks.

(crowd reactions
of disappointment)

Just a perfect time to refill
those gingerbread lattes.

I... I...

What on Earth's going on,
Cynthia? They're all waiting!

We hit a slight
technical hiccup

but we'll be ready
any minute now.

Any minute!
Well, I'm telling you,

I am not impressed by this.

Not impressed by this at all.
I'm sorry, we hit...

If these kids can't take
their music program seriously,

then why should
the school board?

This whole debacle's proven
my instincts were right.

Our funds could be put
to a much better use elsewhere.

Ethan, look.
No matter how you perform,

you'd still be showing
that you are more impressive

than 99%
of the people out there

that don't even have the guts
to follow their dreams.

Remember what I said-
trust your intuition.

You've got this.

And... and you don't
have to be perfect.

You just have to make
the audience feel something.

(phone notification beeping)

Uh, guys?
What's up?

I just got an email
from the Powell School of Music.

They said they loved the song
and the performance.

They wanna see me
for a final in-person audition!

Oh my God.

That's incredible,
congratulations!

Wow, I didn't even know
you applied!

Nice work.

Yeah, that audition tape
we sent in,

I knew it was gonna
blow their minds.

I didn't even think
it was that good.

We made it
in like two minutes.

Audition tape?

Yeah, he performed
"A Christmas Melody"

and we sent it
to the admissions coordinator.

That's what you sent?

Yeah.
What do you think I sent?

Wait... did you think
that I sent our song out

without your permission?

Just what you were saying
on the phone.

It sounded like you...

Abby, I would never
betray you like that.

I'm so sorry
I jumped to conclusions.

No, it's okay. I'm sorry
you thought that of me.

You have nothing
to apologise for.

I let my experience with Casey
Macey cloud my judgment and...

Uh, guys?

Don't we have a song
to perform?

Yes. We do.
Uh, yeah.

Come on, let's get ready.
Let me help you.

Thanks.

Put that on.
All right, let's go.

Abby:
Let's go find the others.

All right, that's enough.
I'm telling them it's over.

Please wait just one more
minute. They worked so hard.

I'm sorry, Cynthia.

Boy: Ethan, hurry up!
We're next!

Girl:
We're next! Hurry up!


They're here!
Oh, thank goodness!

Finally.

Okay. Okay.

(excited chatter)

Okay, guys.

I think we gotta stick
with "Deck the Halls".

It's the song we practiced,
it's the song we know.

It'll be great.
No.

We can't end the entire ceremony
on a repeat song.

We need to wow
Superintendent Davis.

We need to do
"A Christmas Melody".

Well, we've only practiced
that song in class once.

We don't even have
the sheet music with us.

Yeah, but we've all
practiced it at home, right?

You guys remember it.

No one's ever heard
the song before,

so do you really think
it'll make an impact?

You'll sing it for us.

What?!

No, she's right.

Your voice is incredible.

With you singing
and Ethan's piano playing,

it could save the program!

Please!
Please, Miss Walker?

(impatient crowd chatter)

Man in audience:
Must be something, right?

This is the last...
Woman: Oh.

Man: Okay. They're here.
(applause)

Man:
Just a little delay.

And now,
may I present to you

the Bellville High School Band's
performance of...

.."A Christmas Melody",

an original song written by
Abby Walker and Travis Tucker.

(crowd cheering)

(coughing in audience)

(playing in soft bell voice)

(hitting discordant note)

(crowd reactions)


It's okay.
(soft crowd chatter)

(inhaling deeply)


(exhaling, resuming playing)

â™ª Ah, ah â™ª

â™ª Silent night
filled with music now â™ª

â™ª This December
could last a year â™ª

â™ª I'd be happy and
I'd still be wanting more â™ª

â™ª With the fire

with carols floatin' through â™ª

(crowd cheering)

Woo!


Woman: Abby, yes!
That was amazing!

(cheers and applause)

(cheering, whistling)

Woo!

Thank you,
Bellville High Band

for a truly spectacular
performance!

I know that our arts program
is in question of funding

for next year,

and I for one
have been prepared

to vote to cut it.

(shocked gasping in audience)

But tonight was not just
an amazing example

of music and talent,

but community,
educational excellence,

and Christmas spirit.

And I am happy to say
that I will not be voting

to cut the funding for
the arts program next year.

Ooh!
Yay!



â™ª

We got our funding!
Mom, this is amazing!

You all did such a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

You did such a great job
planning this whole thing!

Oh, thanks, honey! Ooh!

(phone ringing)

Oh. Gotta get this.

Excuse me.


Thank you so much.

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Abby, hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you on Christmas Eve.

I was working late,
I wanted to call you

before leaving
for the holidays.

Oh, it's not a bother at all.
What's up, McKayla?

I thought you should know,
Brenda never sent your song out.

What?

McKayla: She's never sent
any of your songs out.

I only found out a few days ago.
I tried to tell you earlier.

But why would she not
send my songs out?

She gets a huge cut

of your corporate
commercial commissions-

more than you know.

She doesn't want you
to quit those.

They're lucrative for her.

After all these years
she's been lying to me?

McKayla:
Here's the thing.

I sent your song
to an executive at a label.

She loved it!

She wants to sign you.
Are you serious?

I could be your agent.
I'll negotiate a deal.

That would be amazing!

Thank you!

Thank you.

But make sure that they know
that I have a partner.

We come as a duo.

You got it.

Thanks again, McKayla.
I gotta go.

Okay. All right, bye.



Shh. Everybody,

we're about to do
the tree lighting.


It is now with great pleasure
that I light our trees-

a tradition
that I hope lasts forever,

along with our arts
Christmas pageant.

Merry Christmas,
everyone.

(crowd reactions of awe)

Wow, so beautiful.

Aw, the big one didn't light.

(indistinct chatter)

Still beautiful.

So, I was thinking,
what do you think

about me sticking around
Bellville for a little bit?

I don't know.
I mean, I'm pretty busy.

Got a lot goin' on.

I'm just kidding.

Of course I would love
for you to stay.

Well, it'd make it
much easier for us

to keep working together,
making music.

Especially since we're about
to have a record deal!

Are you... are you serious?

I am!

What!
(giggling)

That's... that's incredible!
Yeah.

But you know, even if we didn't
have a record deal,

I'd still wanna sing
with you.

I never wanna stop making music
with you, Travis Tucker.
