(thunder rumbling)

[Rob] Until that day,

I'd always been skeptical
about the concept of fate,

believing that there's little in our lives

truly beyond our control.

But since then, I've had experiences

too impossible to be
accredited to mere chance.

There've been three of these moments

that have defined my life
and redefined my beliefs.

That afternoon at the airport
meeting her, was the first.

Glad you made it.

How pressed for time are we here?

Very, we got about 25 minutes at most.

All right, well I apologize,

but as you know, we need a water source,

so we're gonna have to
show you the prototype

in the men's room, rig it up to the sink.

While you're being amazed,

I'll get everything wrapped up here.

Great.

This is it.

Let's see what it can do.

And as you know,

there was a couple of problems
we were having initially.

The timing mechanism was off

and it was directly
related to the hydro input.

Now, since the firing has to be exact,

well we just bled off

a percentage of the
used water before evap.

And we are so accurate,

that we only had to compromise

two pieces of the 600 samples that we ran.

Incredible.

And we're ready to fire it up.

(dramatic instrumental music)

48 seconds.

Excuse me?

Yeah.

Are you in the business or a workaholic?

Both, actually, sort of.

I was just wondering because I need

to update the system
that my business uses,

and I really don't know much
about that sort of thing.

[Rob] Well, it's not really my area,

but I know some people with
whom I could put you in contact.

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Leslie.

Rob.

So are you coming or going?

[Leslie] I just got back.

So you live here?

That I do.

Fabulous.

This is really good.

Perfect, actually.

Is this really it?

[Rob's friend] Check it out, you'll see.

This'll blow 'em away.

Should have everyone's attention

once you tell them what
this thing is capable of.

We're just amazed how much
power you're able to contain

in such a compact area.

Well, we just fill the order.

You have to carry the ball from here.

You know, I could never figure out

how anyone could stand
that kind of monotony.

Day in, day out, year after year.

How do you live in such an amazing world

and never want to leave your front porch?

Resignation to contentment.

We have become a society
that aspires to mediocrity

out of the fear of failure.

Remember, unfaltering commitment
is a double-edged sword.

The greater the determination,
the more likely the success.

But for those who don't achieve,

the more cognizant they
are of their failure.

The bigger they are the harder they fall

applies to ambitions as well.

And sure, the rewards are greater,

but the costs escalate proportionately.

The upside is it's that
necessary assiduous desire

and a little bit of talent to back it up

that makes anything possible.

You seem determined, that's for sure.

And I suspect the talent as well.

Well, I've always had the
benefit of knowing what I want.

I have recently found myself

in the same situation,
very recently, in fact.

What is it?

This man thinks there's a couple of men

in the terminal with a
bomb in their possession.

I'm not sure it was a bomb,

nobody said anything
about it being a bomb,

but they sure seemed
like they meant business.

Where was it?

In the bathroom.

Yeah, I was in the bathroom
in one of the stalls.

That is so weird.

I have never met anyone who
has ever even heard of him,

let alone read and understood him.

It was awkward at first,

getting over the fact

that everything he wrote is figurative.

I think not having a constant in the work

would scare off most readers.

Oh no, but that's what's fascinated me.

You feel such a sense of jubilation

when the picture comes together,

and the next paragraph,

you find yourself starting from scratch.

Drowning truths having
dissolved into metaphor.

And abstract metaphors at that.

It's probably why he's never
had a book over 80 pages.

Probably.

Can you wait around a minute?

I've got to take care of this,

but I don't want you running off on me.

Sure.

Well?

It's everything you said it was.

To be honest, I didn't think
you'd be able to make it work.

You keep it just short of impossible,

prepare to be amazed.

I'm beginning to think
so, but this is the big one.

This is gonna make us both a lot of money.

I just need enough to keep him

in crayons and coloring books,

with the occasional shock therapy.

Did you get all the stats transferred?

I did, it just about
filled your hard drive.

The documents are in
there we'll need signed

to start work on the full size unit.

The bookkeepers and lawyers
will have to handle all that.

Once I throw this in everyone's lap

and get showered with
praise, my job's done.

Are you sure you don't want
to take the box with you?

Show 'em yourself?

My word's good enough.

Who would question me?

Good point.

Excellent job, he's sold.

Hey, I'm a closer.

Can you give me a minute?

Don't you mean two minutes?

I'm sorry about that.

It was the reason you were here.

That it was.

[Cop #1] Put it down!
[Cop #2] Don't move!

Is this multiple choice?

[Cop #1] I said, put it down.

[Cop #3] It's over, man.

[Rob's Friend] I'm just a hostage.

Shoot him.

[Rob] Don't say it.

This is not the time.

[Cop #1] Lay down on the ground.

Hands behind your head.

Whoa whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.

This is bad, this is bad.

Other arm.

[Rob] Wait a minute, this is a mistake.

How do I get a hold of you?

(soft instrumental music)

Well, I guess somebody
owes you guys an apology.

Suppose that falls on me.

Sorry guys.

How about that ride to the airport?

Sounds great.

Okay.

Look, anything I can
ever do, you just ask.

Thanks, stay frosty.

We'll try.

Hey, grab the stuff.

Sure.

Hi, I'm Rob, has a
message been left for me?

No, no message here.

You could try it information, though.

Thank you.

[Cashier] I'll help whoever's next.

I'm sorry.

I don't think I heard you correctly.

Did you say I'll help whoever's next?

Or did you say, I'll help
whatever inconsiderate,

classless hick gets here first,

regardless of how long the people

have been waiting in the other line?

Blow me.

Ooh, a scholar.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize your
rudeness was a direct result

of you wanting to run home
and hit the books, Einstein.

What?

Ah, you don't approve?

It's not my place to say.

No, but it is your place to look at me

like a pedophilic leprous
ex-postal worker with bad hair

for wanting to buy it.

Go ahead, tell me you don't approve.

I can handle it.

I just don't know what men like you

get out of smut like this.

Well, I wish I could tell you

I was buying it for the articles,

but the truth is, I'm gonna go home

and jerk myself into a state of bliss.

You wouldn't happen to have any

petroleum jelly, or baby
oil, or Pledge, would you?

So, what time are you done here?

No message?

Nothing.

Don't tell me you're surprised.

I don't even know if I can put a name

on what I'm feeling right now.

I ran into your mom yesterday.

Oh yeah.

I don't think she recognized me though.

It's probably the curse
of substandard looks

and a fledgling personality.

Good point.

So how's your dad?

Hmm?

How's your dad doing?

I don't know, I haven't
seen him much lately.

You know, I was thinking yesterday

of that time we missed the
bus and he drove us to school.

When was this?

Come on, remember junior high school.

He was driving us to
school, and he let us skip.

And I thought that was
so cool at the time.

My father would've never done that.

Why don't I remember this?

Because you're an idiot.

Come on, he said that he would
take us to the arcade first,

but then we had to go to the museum.

Certainly a fair trade-off
instead of school.

Okay, I remember.

That was the first time I
enjoyed anything cultural.

Oh come on, you liked the nudes.

And that Dwayne Hanson sculpture

we thought was a real guy for
the first hour we were there.

I remember, I remember that painting.

Was it a Chagall?

Remember, your father asked
us what we thought of it.

And you said the painter
used too much blue.

You remember that?

Barely.

See that's the part
that I remember the most.

Your dad said that you needed to look past

what you didn't like,

to see if there was something
else there that you did,

that may be there's something
else you could get out of it.

You know, he said that if you
could see past that one flaw,

you know that one thing you
couldn't stand about it,

that maybe there was
something special beneath,

you know, something you were missing.

I didn't think you got it at the time,

but I realized he wasn't just talking

about the painting, was he?

Where is all this coming from?

I don't know, I just asked
how your dad was doing.

You didn't know, so I guess
he's the same as always.

(phone ringing)

Hang on.

Hello?

Hey, how you doing?

I'm enlightening a friend.

Sure, when?

Make it an hour.

Okay, cool, awesome.

This babe is hot.

Here you go.

What's this?

A good-looking guy like you
shouldn't go home alone.

See ya stud.

Hi.

Hi.

Mom said there were some packages here?

Are they here?

Yeah, they're here.

Like always.

You know, you could just
tell me where they are.

What I'd like to know is,

why you don't have these
things shipped to the office,

or even your place?

Well, I'm not home during the day,

and a lot of times there's
nobody at the office.

I told you that before.

And I told you before that
I got better things to do

than to play your secretary twice a week.

I get pulled away from what I'm doing

to deal with your shit.

Oh well, I didn't realize
this was such a big deal.

You guys said you wouldn't mind.

No, your mother said she wouldn't mind.

You never asked me.

And it isn't a big deal,

but it is an annoyance.

You know, for as well as
you claim to be doing,

I'm just amazed that
you can't afford someone

to answer the phone

and sign for your little packages,

instead of putting your
parents out with it.

I have a cell phone and
a machine at the office.

What do you think, I
should spend $500 a week

to have somebody to do 10 minutes of work

signing for packages?

No, not when your mother
and I will do it for free.

Why would you?

Fine. Look mom said she wouldn't mind,

so I'll just have to hope she's around.

If not, you can refuse my packages,

and if you're real lucky

you can ruin my business in the process.

Come on, Rob.

Don't try to make me the bad guy here.

I never promised this
shit in the first place.

They're here.

Yep, they showed up last night.

How many?

16, four boxes.

Did you try one?

Yeah, we had both of mine,

they were part of last
night's festivities.

How are they?

They're unbelievable.

I mean, if these things clear the FDA,

we will cap for sure.

They're gonna have to go with ours.

So is that the aspiring porn star?

No, not even close.

She's a nun.

Yeah, right.

No, I'm serious.

She was gonna be a nun.

Get outta here.

No, I'm telling you, she didn't make it.

How do you not make it?

Low SATs?

I mean, it can't be the underwear thing.

She just lost her faith.

I'll tell you this though, last night,

I had her on her knees thanking God.

You wanna sea the rug burn?

Maybe later.

So what'd you do last night?

You know, nothing big.

You didn't go to the airport, did you?

What? No.

You did, didn't you?

Hi.

Hey.

I'm gonna grab a smoothie,
do you want anything?

Yeah, why don't you grab,

would you grab some chocolate
syrup, some cherries,

and some more paper towels?

Hey, do we have any ice left?

No, I'm pretty sure we used it all.

Do you think we should get some more?

Definitely.
All right.

What do you do to these girls?

Girls?

She's 19, and don't try
and skirt the issue.

You were at the airport again last night,

looking for her.

So I stopped by for
a few minutes, so what?

So what?

It's been over a week, Rob.

She's obviously not looking for you.

I want to find her.

What are you gonna do?

Are you gonna hire a detective?

Or are you gonna hack the passenger list

and find out what flight she was on?

I tried that.

You did not.

Well, actually I gave
the ticket agent 200 bucks

to get me a print out of
the manifest of the flight.

She wouldn't do it.

I would hope not.

Man, you're losing it, my friend.

Let me wake you up a
little bit here, all right?

In fairy tales, the hopeless
romantic gets the girl.

In real life, they get
arrested for stalking.

You just don't understand.

You're obviously worked
up about this girl.

You need to relax.

What are you doing tonight?

Why?

(rock music)

I saw this guy strip out of a suit once.

Oh my God, it was hot.

This is turning into an
expensive evening for you.

Are you telling me that
ass isn't worth a dollar?

Wait, don't answer that
until he takes his pants off.

Ooh, can't wait.

Hey, shake it over this way, stud.

Why are you not having fun?

I am, but unlike you

it's just not the night of
my seedy over-sexed life.

My life isn't seedy.


It's that mad bomber, isn't it?

What?

You got a thing for that
sexy terrorist, don't you?

I don't have a thing for anyone.

Uh huh.

Sure.

Hey, bring it right here, big boy.

[DJ] Okay ladies, grab your pencils,

it's time for contestant number three.

(rock music)

â™ª I try every night to understand why â™ª

â™ª God made me everything you desire â™ª

â™ª I smile every night, knowing that I â™ª

â™ª With my touch, can
set your body on fire â™ª

â™ª Then you stand up here in my light â™ª

â™ª I'm your heaven tonight â™ª

â™ª You're my girl, just for
tonight. Prepare for delight. â™ª

Hey.

How'd it go last night?

I was great.

You should have been there.

I'll get over it.

Your girl was there.

What?

The airport babe, Lonnie.

Leslie, she was there?

She was.

Did you talk to her about me,

tell her I was looking for her?

No, actually I didn't get a chance to.

By the time I had come
back, she was already gone.

Did you get a license plate, anything?

Uh, no.

Which club was this?

Oh no, there is no way
I'm going to be dragging you

out of a male strip
club every other night.

I mean the airport is bad enough.

And besides, I really don't think

you'd catch her there again anyway.

She didn't exactly seem
to be having a good time.

I just wish you would've been
able to talk to her for me.

I don't know what good
that would have done.

What was I gonna say?

Hi, I'm the the half-naked best friend

of the airport terrorist
you met two weeks ago.

His visitation rights are
coming up in a couple of weeks,

and he'd really love you to stop by.

I should've been there.

Well look, next time I'm there,

If I see her, I'll let you know.

But I really wouldn't get your hopes up.

You're going back?

Yes I am, two weeks, semi-finals baby.

Hey, I'm shopping here,
come on I'm shopping here.

So listen, did you get the
note I left you on the Baron?

No.

Well, we found out that
he's a resident of Portugal.

Isn't it a bit late to be
getting this information?

I know, but I just found out.

Was he born there?

I don't know yet.

We're looking into it.

Oh my God, why is everything
going wrong at once?

Look, let's not get uptight right now.

I mean, if he wasn't born
there, nothing changes.

Yeah, but if he was,

we need a new runner that
sets us back what, six months?

Look, let's just wait 'til
we get word back on him.

Did you try calling him?

Yes, I did.

His maid said that he was out

at the Salisbury Plains
with some psychics.

I don't know, checking astral
projections around Stonehenge.

What?

How do we get mixed
up with these people?

I don't know.

All right, well let me know

as soon as you hear anything on that.

Yeah.

Did you go out with that
stripper the other night?

Please, exotic dancer.

Well, whatever.

How'd it go?

Well, if there was a place
where we can condemed idiots,

she'd have her own kingdom.

So did you sleep with her?

Well, yeah.

I mean, what else am I gonna do?

You know, it's-

[Abusive Father] Knock it off.

I mean, it's not like, you know,

polysyllabic conversation was out,

and it's not like we shared views on,

actually she had no views.

What do you possibly see in these women?

Debauchery.

I mean, I'm afraid that's
all there is my friend.

You see Rob, the Leslie's
of this world do not exist.

Nah, listen, she may be
smart, beautiful, and caring.

But if you got to know her,

I bet you she has any number
of major personality flaws,

which seriously offset those gifts.

Now, if you're lucky, maybe,

maybe she only has a fear of commitment,

or any physical contact
beyond the handshake.

Maybe she likes guys who
chew with their mouths open.

Gets turned on by the smell of Ajax.

Best case scenario,

you spend a lifetime trying
to straighten her out,

which you never do,

but you keep yourself so busy

with the delusions of improvement

that you never realized the lost cause

you took on in the first place.

Worst case scenario,

worst case scenario, she ends up

killing you, or herself,

or taking out a restaurant full of people

with a street legal automatic
weapon of your choice.

I mean worse yet, even
that, listen to this.

One night, right, after dinner,

during the course of, you know,

just casual conversation,

she leans over and says,

hey, maybe O.J. didn't do it.

I mean, I'm not gonna
subject myself to such grief.

I mean, the reason that I get
along with a woman so well,

is that before I finish
saying a word to her,

I have resigned myself to the fact

that she is gonna be a complete flake.

I won't be able to put up with
her for more than a month.

[Rob] You know, it's kind
of sad that a guy your age

has already given up.

Given up?

I've never wasted the energy

in deluding myself in the first place.

I mean, I'm actually,

I'm actually amazed that a
guy as intelligent as yourself

buys into a, I mean granted romantic,

but foolishly unattainable
popular ideology.

[Abusive Father] Knock that shit off!

Rob?

Hey, are you okay?

You sure?

It's over. What's your name?

Hey, I want to press charges.

This guy attacked me.

I want him arrested.

I want him arrested now.

Hold on.

I want to know what happened.

Like I told you, he just
started beating on me.

That's not entirely true, is it?

Well, you keep this psycho away from me?

I want him thrown in jail.

You're the one that should be locked up,

you piece of shit.

Hold on.

What happened?

[Manager] I didn't see anything.

It was over by the time I got here.

What happened?

Huh?

[Cop] What'd you see?

I was reading this.

[Cop] You didn't see anything?

Well, if I saw anything, I
saw this piece of shit here

hit this little boy so hard

that it knocked him to the ground.

Then I saw my friend do
what I would have done

if I had the guts, and a loaf of bread.

Do I know you?

Yes, sir.

That's right.

You're the guy with the
bomb from the airport.

Hey, I said I wanted to press charges-

Wait, right there.

He hit the kid?

That's right.

Hard?

Hard enough to knock him to the ground.

We saw him mistreating him earlier, too.

Did you punch him or slap him?

Neither, I was hitting him with that.

You beat on him with a loaf of bread?

Yeah.

How many times?

I dunno, a dozen maybe, it broke.

I see.

Wait here, let me see what I can do.

Now I want you to tell me what happened.

I didn't say anything to the guy,

and he starts whacking me with that.

You look okay now, do
you need an ambulance?

No, but I want to press charges.

Is that your son?

Yeah, that's my boy.

My wife's kid.

Did you hit him?

No, he wasn't listening to me.

I patted him, but it's
not like I beat him.

Did you knock him to the ground?

No, he was trying to
get away and he tripped.

Okay, I'm gonna need you
to turn around for me sir,

and put your hands behind your head.

What, what are you talking about?

I don't believe you,

and I'm taking you in on child abuse.

Well, that's bullshit.

Turn around for me and put
your hands behind your head.

I didn't do anything.

What about him?

He's gonna walk out of here
and you're going to jail,

and if I had to ask you again,

to turn around and do as I say

we'll call that resisting arrest.

How do you want to do this?

Don't push me on this.

Listen, do you want to talk

about what just happened in there?

What's there to talk about?

You were in there, you saw it.

Let me tell you what I saw, okay?

I saw the two of us watch a guy

get a little rough with his kid.

Then I see you backtrack to pick

up a monstrous loaf of bread,

I mean, to the likes of which

I've never seen you buy before.

After that, we happen
to be in the same aisle

with the guy and his kid,

until the father does
what either one of us

would have expected him to do.

Then you did what I think
you were planning to do

from the moment you saw him
rough up the little boy.

That's quite a theory,
but you forgot to mention

the guy with the other loaf
of bread on the grassy knoll.

Let me go one further.

I think that that lashing out in there,

is just another example of
your unstable temperament.

Oh, unstable temperament?

Yeah, ever since the airport Rob,

you've had a markedly short fuse.

And?

And I just think it's time for you

to go see the police chief.

I mean, it's obvious that
your passive approach

is not working.

It's just seems a little
extreme, almost obsessive,

don't you think?

You know what, it's like this,

the man who wants to understand the world

needs simply to pick up a book.

A man who wants to rule it, must write it.

So, are you ready to rule?

You know, I am.

Good.


What was it your pink fuzzy ones?

Hey.

Hey, don't we have a
warrant out for this guy?

Assault with a leavened weapon.


You know something?

You're really lucky.

The last guy who was attacked

with a loaf of bread around here,

died of a yeast infection.


Hey, and it's a good thing

you didn't kill that guy last night.

We have to start calling you Bread Bundy.

No, he was a cereal killer.

At least bread's in the same food group.


Hey look, if you decide
to attack anybody tonight,

would you use a bottle of
mustard and some salami?

That way the guys in the
evidence room can have a picnic.


Well, I know you didn't come down here

just to let us pick on you.

Well no, actually there is something

you could help me with.

What is it?

Do you have a sketch artist?

(light instrumental music)

Yeah?

Yeah, what?

[Burger Flipper] What do you want?

What do I want?

I'm here to sign up for the
next Dale Carnegie course.

Never heard of him?

There's a shocker.

What do you think I want?

I want to eat.

I can take your order.

I'd like the number two with a Coke.

Let's see, I'll have
two hamburgers, no onions,

a fry and a large Coke.

You can get the number four,
it's the two burger combo.

You know I don't doubt the number four

is a two burger combo.

I also believe you, when
you tell me I can order it.

However, the number four wouldn't give me

what I just ordered, would it?

You wouldn't to get a large Coke,

but you can supersize
it for 19 cents more.

Yes, and if I did that, I
would also get a large fry,

which is not what I wanted to order.

So if you want to sell me the
number four without onions,

and charge me nine and a half cents

to have a large Coke
with that, I'll do it.

We don't do that.

Well, that certainly
wasn't easy now was it?

That'll be 6.72.

How long could it
take to fry up a burger?

[Rob] You did order it special.

Special?

No, I ordered it the way I like it.

I mean, I find pre-prepared food

the bane of the service industry.

And people like you, well you capitulate

and you'll take whatever they
tell you is easiest to get.

I don't give in so easily.

I don't want onions on my burger, period.

I'm not gonna eat onions.

I'm not gonna scrape them
off like some vagrant.

I want my hamburger prepared sans onion.

I'm the customer, and I'm always right.

Then expect to wait.

[Burger Flipper #2] Here.

Thank you.

Hang on a sec.

Could you send your
manager over here, please?

[Burger Flipper #2] Hold on.

What is this about?

The service here is abominable.

All right, let me tell you
another little observation

that my keen insights
have made me aware of.

As the service in fast
food restaurants like this

began to deteriorate over the years,

the management started
to notice the business

that was being lost.

Now in particular,

the business that utilizes
the drive-through lane, right?

So over the years,

as the service got more
and more unacceptable,

more and more people would
grow tired of waiting,

and they'd leave the drive-through line.

So now these establishments,

instead of trying to improve the service,

and expedite the orders a
little bit more promptly, no,

they came up with the brilliant
idea of building barricades

on either side of the drive-through line,

to trap those hungry rats

foolish enough to enter that maze.

Well, not me, never.

I mean, no matter how long the wait,

how inept the service,
you're boxed in like cattle.

How pathetic will people
let themselves get?

By the millions people
flock to these places

to pay for these
overpriced, overrated meals,

packaged in a way that's
convenient for the establishment.

And then, then they put
themselves in thrall

of the towering incompetence of service

that is responsible for
shoveling up these feasts,

by pulling into the black hole

known as the drive-through lane.

Everything is an issue, isn't it?

Can I help you?

Yes, I was wondering if as manager

you encourage customer service
in your service business,

which happens to deal with customers?

Of course, is there a problem?

Oh yeah.

I was wondering if any of your people

know the first thing about courtesy?

I mean, I'm amazed that throughout

my entire experience here,

I have yet to hear the words, please,

thank you, or you're welcome.

When my food was brought
over, I was told here.

I mean I would have expected,
'Sorry about the wait, sir',

but I can't tell you that
I'm terribly surprised.

I mean, is courtesy just a lost idea

in the fast food branch
of the service industry?

[Manager] Well, I'm sorry.

I'm actually inclined to think

that the fast food branch

is no longer under the umbrella
of the service industry.

I mean, at least one
of your guys back there

can hardly speak any English.

Now, that would be fine if
you had him dunking fries,

but no, you've got him
up front taking orders.

I heard him ask a guy four times

if he wanted to buy a cherry pie.

Okay, you see-

I thought he was asking the guy

if you wanted to rent a Cherokee.

You should just be thankful, okay,

that he wasn't serving me.

Because if he was, there'd be snipers

on the roof across the street,

waiting for me to reveal myself.

I mean, how bad are you
gonna let things get?

Okay, I understand you're upset.

I'm sorry.

I just, I don't have time for this.

That guy does all
the hiring right there.

Well, at least he said he was sorry.

Yeah, he did.

And if he could have
mustered up enough saliva

he would have spat in my eye.

Anyways, any word on the flyers?

Not yet, but I put
them all over the place.

It shouldn't be long now.

Right.

So, do you think I'll hear from her?

Or her lawyer.

(soft instrumental music)

This isn't funny.

It kind of is actually.

I spoke to this guy
for maybe 10 minutes.

What is wrong with him?

You must have made some impression.

Did he?

I came across a bunch
more of those pictures

you drew when you were
in your flying phase.

I remember that.

There must be a hundred of those.

More, this last box has a
couple hundred all by itself.

You were really quite obsessed
with the idea for a while.

What kid wasn't?

I remember when you sat me down

and told me that some day I could fly.

I could learn to fly a
plane or sail a hang glider.

You even mentioned
skydiving, remember that?

You regretted mentioning
that one right away,

like I'd run out and do
it at nine years old.

I thought it would make you feel better,

but you just got more depressed.

I was so sure that if
I wanted it badly enough,

I could learn to fly like Superman.

No nets, no wires,

defy gravity, just soar.

Simply a matter of will.

[Mom] Whatever happened to that dream?

Guess I didn't want it badly enough.

So are are you seeing anyone?

I ran into your little
assistant the other day.

He had a lovely young woman on his arm.

He always does though, doesn't he?

He seems to.

[Mom] Well, what about you?

I met a woman I think I
could get serious about.

What's she like?

She sends me flying.

You blocked the garage.

Sorry, I was only
gonna be a few minutes.

Out of respect for me,

could you at least park
at the end of the drive,

so I can get in my own house?

I didn't think I'd be
here when you get back.

Anyway, I'm leaving.

Put my car in the
garage on your way out.

Bye, mom.

Bye, honey.

(mysterious instrumental music)

You're gonna call him.

This is ridiculous.

I knew you'd call him.

I'm telling him to stop.

Uh-huh.

(phone ringing)

Solutions, Rob here.

I want you to stop with the flyers.

Well, sure, of course.

I just wanted to see you again

so I could explain what happened.

I don't want to see you.

I don't want to talk to you.

I just want to be left alone.

But at least give me a chance.

Just stay out of my life.

I stand corrected.

You are an oak.

Well, if you're lucky, you'll
never hear from him again.

If you're really lucky,

maybe he wasn't as special
as you first thought.

So, what'd she say?

She wants to be left alone,

wants me to stay out of her life.

But she called.

But she called.

Hi.

Do you have The Count?

[Clerk] I'm sorry they're all out.

(sentimental instrumental music)

Flowers for Leslie.

I told you I wanted to be left alone.

But these are flowers.

They're soft, beautiful,

smell heavenly.

Everyone likes flowers.

I like flowers.

It's you I don't know about.

[Rob] I just want a chance.

Someone called on the reward.

One of your customers.

Tell me, which one of
my ex-customers was it?

Which one of your preferred customers?

I can't remember.

Oh, of course not.

[Rob] So it was nice of your boss

to give you the day off.

[Leslie] I am the boss.

So why are we here?

To have fun.

I know, it's just not a
normal place to take a date.

Well, actually I brought
you here to impress you.

Ooh, do you own the place?

No, but I know what a woman like you

wants more than anything.

Oh, really?

And what is that?

Stuffed animals, of course.

We'll go down here.

Wanna do this?

You want to give it a try?

Sure.

Okay, one dollar.


Here you go, here's your prize.

I don't know, that
looked like luck to me.

Really? Can I do this again?

Yeah, yeah, you can win two a day.


Yes, seat.

I don't know, I still think
you got lucky on that one.

I'll prove you wrong

when you have a room full of these things.

You can win two a day, sir.

Then it looks like
we'll need season passes.

That sounds like a deal.

God, I love pizza.

You love pizza?

Mm-hmm.

Like the same way you love your family?

You know what I mean.

I know, I just hate to
see that word misused.

You hate it?

TouchÃ©.

So then what do you love?

Hmm, I decided a while ago

that I either had to buy into the fact

that the word love is misused,

or be the only one to
say it with conviction.

And you chose the latter?

Actually no, I came up with a new word.

It's not as perverted, as artificial.

You know, love can be used
as a noun, verb, slang.

I mean that's the
problem, it's too diverse.

Look, people talk about loving their pet,

or their car.

Or pizza.

Or pizza.

My word has one use.

It's not some feeling or urge
or perennial inner conflict.

It's a state of existence,

when one's life becomes
enmeshed in another.

When the other dominates
your thoughts and demands,

a definition of your life.

I mean, some people talk
about loving their spouses

as much as they love a good cup of coffee.

And that's just never been enough

of a promise for me anyway.

And what's the word for all
of this spiritual perfection?

It's not spiritual perfection,

it's self-actualization.

But coming up with a word
was just as difficult

as coming up with this abstract
ideal that I believe in.

I chose my word from the
romantic writings on love,

before modern society
obliterated it's meaning.

The word comes from the writings
of Plato and Campanella,

and the stories of Cupid and Penelope.

It's when the state of the ideal was held

with such reverence, that
men would kill and die

just for the slightest
chance of obtaining it.

That's the era from
which I derive my word.

I know it may be foolishly idealistic,

but that's the true basis of romanticism

which I like to believe in.

And what's the word?

Cytalia.

Cytalia?

How's it used?

It's independent of all others.

It only has one use.

And that way it's not open for misuse

or misinterpretation.

When someone says it, that's it.

Everything else is just confirmation.

It sounds like you've
given this a lot of thought.

It must mean a lot to you.

Nah, I just wrote my
college thesis on it,

because nothing else came to mind.

There's nothing like writing
80 pages on something

that most people can
describe in one sentence.

It certainly gives one
a heightened perception

of what the word love means,

when you spend that much
time thinking about it.

What do you think about that?

Nice.

Nice?

Very nice.

You like it?

Leslie, I love when you do that.

â™ª When all my dreams had passed â™ª

â™ª Had scattered far too fast â™ª

â™ª You came and set me free â™ª

â™ª Thinking that I couldn't win â™ª

â™ª I realize I'd given in â™ª

â™ª But then you rescued me â™ª

â™ª When I look into your eyes â™ª

â™ª Everything feels right â™ª

â™ª When you're smiling back at me â™ª

â™ª It seems like it's meant to be â™ª

â™ª Living life in shades of gray â™ª

â™ª Masquerading day by day â™ª

â™ª Now this life is something new â™ª

â™ª I found there's something more â™ª

â™ª Then I've ever felt before â™ª

â™ª I was lost till I found you â™ª

â™ª When I look into your eyes â™ª

â™ª Everything feels right â™ª

â™ª When you're smiling back at me â™ª

â™ª I know that it's meant to be â™ª

â™ª Lost in this bliss â™ª

â™ª Ever wanting one more kiss â™ª

â™ª Don't know what to do â™ª

Why did you go to all this trouble?

What do you mean?

I mean, dinner a la Dali,

the flowers, the candles, everything.

Don't you think you're worth it?

It's not about what I think.

Yes, I think you're worth it.

Every sonnet, every kiss,

every whisper, all of it.

Be careful.

You might spoil me.

Hmm, every minute of
every hour of every day.

If you'd let me.

What did I ever do to deserve you?

[Rob] I think I should be
asking that question of you.

There is definitely something
very unusual going on here.

What do you mean?

You know what I mean,
don't play naive with me.

I have no idea.

You know, these intoxicating moods

that frequently overcome us,

and these classically romantic mindsets

that we keep finding ourselves in,

and this magical courtship
blossoming around us.

You noticed right?

Oh, that.

It's pretty great, huh?

Ideal.

And do you ever wonder how

rare what we have is?

Every day.

One with a limited vocabulary
may even call it, love,

for lack of a better word.

One might.

I don't know anyone
who has what we have.

[Rob] Lasagna?

You behave.

I don't think my parents have it,

I don't think they ever did.

Yours?

No, my mom's great, but she's
not a member of that elite.

I think it takes a certain type of person.

It's just not who she is.

My dad certainly doesn't have it.

I don't understand what's
between you and your father.

He's always so nice,

but there's such a chasm
between the two of you.

You've seen him the best he's ever been.

I don't know, when you're around,

he's more like a dad than he's ever been.

It is strange.

Why? What's wrong?

What's between you two?

I don't know,

none of the things I expected, I guess.

Maybe I expected too much.

I certainly didn't have
a perfect childhood,

but then again, who does?

I don't know.

I blame my father for so many things,

because I feel like I missed out,

and we can never go back.

He's been an alcoholic for
as long as I can remember.

And I hated him for that.

I guess if I felt like he'd just

try to be my dad,

then maybe we could bridge the gap.

Meet halfway or something, I don't know.

For as much time as I've
spent thinking about it,

there are no answers to be
had, no good ones anyway.

And how in the world did
we get on this anyway?

I don't know.

All right, change of topic.

Are you ready for your present?

[Leslie] What present?

Don't tell me you forgot what today is.

Today isn't a holiday.

Actually, today is the
midpoint between your birthdays,

six months to the day.

You got me a half-birthday present?

You're gonna flip.

Oh, my God.

You always wanted to go.

Three weeks, we go.

Oh, why would you do this for no reason?

You're not actually gonna make me

answer that again, are you?

Thank you.

Did you call in the gelatin?

Because if we don't have that

by Tuesday morning 10 o'clock,

we eat a 30% penalty.

No pun intended.

I know.

Look, I took care of it.

Nothing to worry about.

What about the gull wing Mercedes?

I didn't call on that.

I talked to him yesterday,

and everything will be done

by the time you get back, all right?

So you take it easy.

Everything's in good hands.

I thought I was leaving things with you?

Have a nice trip.

You know how to get me.

Yeah.

Looks like you've already been gotten.

(light Caribbean music)

Checking in, sir?

Yes, Rob Provis.

Okay.

What time is it here?

It's ten minutes of eleven.

Thank you.

(sentimental orchestral music)

Thank you.

Make some memories while you're with us.

(romantic piano music)

Cytalia.

Thank you, honey.


How was your dinner?

Scrumptious, but for $4,000
I would expect nothing less.

It's hard to get accustomed to it.

Felt just as odd giving
a cab driver a $500 tip.

How much was that?

About eight bucks, I think.

Rob, I'm having a
wonderful time with you.

I don't want to make you
feel awkward or anything but,

I can't help but wonder how
you see things between us.

I think you're amazing, you know that.

I'm okay with the way things are.

I mean, if this is as far as
it goes, I'm okay with that.

You are the most

amazing and intelligent,
compassionate man I've ever met.

And I would never do anything
to push you away from me.

I just,

I try not to have any expectations.

I am so happy every single
moment we are together,

and I will be for as long as it lasts.

I just, it's just hard for me

not to put myself in a position where

you could break my heart.

So I just want to get an idea from you,

how you see things between us,

and how you feel about me.

I'm babbling, aren't I?

As long as I can remember,

I've never been the type of guy

that's been afraid of anything.

Always been in control.

When you're in control,

there's nothing to be afraid of.

This past year you've
become everything to me.

I can't stop thinking about you.

You know, I never have
a shortage of words.

And when I'm with you, I find myself

stumbling over my words.

Not to mention the pounding inside of me,

trembling of my hands when I touch you.

I can't control any of it.

It's a wonderful feeling, but it also

scares the hell out of me
because it's so unknown.

You obviously have a better
grasp of what's going on,

because I am spiraling blissfully

out of control towards you.

Never, never ever imagined
caring this much about a woman.

And I know that I can never ever

find somebody as special as you are.

Every day I find myself becoming

more and more infatuated with you.

Uncontrollably.

What was the question again?

I don't remember.

(gentle waves lapping)

Here?

Yeah.

What if someone comes?

Someone will.

There comes a time in a man's life

that circumscribes his very existence.

When this portentous
forever reveals itself,

one must embrace it wholeheartedly,

becoming master and
servant to its beneficence,

or risk deprivation of the ultimate

irreplaceable delectation,

that oh so rarely occurs,

and never recurs, in the
brevity of one's lifetime.

Those are some pretty big
words there, college boy.

What have you been out doing?

Boning a librarian?

Or have you been sleeping

with a thesaurus under your pillow?

Wow. Congratulations.

You know, I was thinking today

of a lot of things, actually.

I was thinking of all the
things that people do,

not based on their own
feelings or judgements,

but based on a reaction to what others

are doing around them.

Art.

Everybody wants to be
chic and have good taste,

but none of them have the courage

to stand by their convictions

of what they judge to be
good taste as being enough.

That's the way art is now.

Some charlatan will convince
the right person of influence

to say that they're great,

and the masses will follow out
of a desire for affiliation.

I mean, look at Jackson Pollack.

I mean, who in their right mind would look

at this man and say, 'Boy, he's gifted.'

'I wish I could paint like that.'

'I mean, Michelangelo's great,'

'but this man has truly
been touched by God.'

'And you should see the
masterpiece his cat painted!'

Did you ever read Sylvia Plath?

Sure.

All right, she's okay at best,

but she's popular because
it's hip and fashionable

to be some misunderstood
suicidal, manic poet.

It must be a sign of talent,

you know, the cost of greatness.

'To be great is to be misunderstood,'

but the reverse certainly
doesn't always apply.

The masses will buy into anything

as being trendy and hip enough

if it comes from the right source,

or even the wrong source,
if it's prevalent enough.

I mean we're only a couple of
celebrity endorsements away

from making nose-picking the new trend.

Why are people so afraid to just say

to hell with everyone else?

Rob, you're babbling.

You're right.

What I'm getting at,

what I'm trying to say is that in my life

I've never cared about
being accepted before.

And, right now

it is the only thing

in the world that matters to me.

I'm not a conformist
either, so I have to refuse.

However, since we are on the
topic, will you marry me?

I accept.

(sentimental orchestral music)

You know that night
we met at the airport,

I had so many emotions running
through me I, I felt dizzy.

And then when I saw you I
knew I had to talk to you,

and I couldn't stop it.

And then we started talking,
and it just clicked,

and I knew why.

I started to melt.

I was so excited and so
nervous and attracted.

I just wanted so much for you to be

everything you seemed to
be in that first moment.

In that one instant, you
became a part of me too.

On the ride to the police station,

I was smiling thinking of you.

Everything was so perfect.

I was sure you'd be there when I got back.

When I realized you weren't there,

it killed me, but I knew,
I knew I'd find you again.

I almost was still there.

I was in my car and I
just wanted to turn around

and go back and wait for you.

And then when I first saw the flyers,

I just wanted to call you so
badly and talk to you again.

And that phone number and your eyes

kept flashing in my mind
every day and every hour,

but I was afraid.

Of what?

I was afraid because I knew

I fall for you so completely,

and that if somehow it didn't work out,

I would never find it again.

It all worked out.

It did, kind of like a dream.

Thank you, Rob.

For what?

For being everything you seemed to be

in that first moment.

So, are we going back to your place?

Don't you mean our place?

How do you know that I'm
not gonna make you sell it

and buy some big mansion with
cooks and servants and maids?

Whatever you want, honey.

I just want it to never end.

(tires squealing)
(cars crashing)

Honey?

Leslie!

No no no no, baby no, no, no, no, no baby.

No no, Leslie.

Please, please, please,
please, please, please, baby.

Oh, baby, please say something.

Please baby, open your eyes.

Please baby, open your eyes.

Please.

Please, help us!

Help us.

(siren blaring)

Could you step away for a moment, sir?

I can't.

I know, but these
guys need to get to her

so they can help.

It's okay.

I'm here now.

You're gonna be okay.

They'll get you all fixed up,

and we'll go away again, okay?

Would you like that?

Make love on the beach again?

We'll get married soon as
you want honey, I promise.

I promise, we're gonna get married.

Say something honey, please.

(quiet sobbing)

(somber orchestral music)

Gonna take some time to
get things back to normal.

She's gonna be a while, I guess.

She's hurt pretty bad.

She really likes the ring.

[Doctor] I'm very sorry.

No.

(dramatic orchestral music)

Rob?

We're gonna get through this, man.

We're gonna get through this.


(soft acoustic music)

â™ª You told me that you love me â™ª

â™ª And you said it with a kiss â™ª

â™ª You promised me forever â™ª

â™ª And now it's come to this â™ª

â™ª Lost and alone â™ª

â™ª Wondering why you've gone â™ª

â™ª Oh, so soon â™ª

â™ª Waiting here alone â™ª

â™ª Wishing that I knew â™ª

â™ª That you're still with me â™ª

â™ª Oh, can't you hear my
heart, crying out for you â™ª

â™ª So now I wait alone â™ª

â™ª Wondering what I did â™ª

This is really something.

It's a 17th century Ballock knife.

That's pretty amazing.

There aren't many of these still around,

and even fewer have the sheath.

It's beautiful.

I swung a good deal for it, too.

I wouldn't be surprised.

Do you want to see
the pictures they sent

on the 8th century bearded
ax I'm trying to acquire?

Sure.

(door closing)

Hi, Rob.

Hi.

You know I just remembered,
I got to go by the office,

and get some stuff for the
accountant for tomorrow.

I gotta go.

Show me later, okay mom?

So, how you been, Rob?

(acoustic guitar music)

â™ª So now you're going to leave me â™ª

â™ª As though you just don't believe me â™ª

â™ª When I say I need you â™ª

â™ª For always â™ª

â™ª I thought our dreams would come true â™ª

â™ª Girl I always believed you â™ª

â™ª When you said you'd never â™ª

â™ª Break my heart â™ª

â™ª And now what can I do â™ª

â™ª If I just can't live without you â™ª

â™ª You're always on my mind â™ª

â™ª What can I say â™ª

â™ª To take this pain away, ooh girl â™ª

â™ª I still need you â™ª

â™ª I can't help thinking back to â™ª

â™ª The things we've been through â™ª

â™ª So nothing in this world â™ª

â™ª Could tear us apart â™ª

â™ª And now I'll try to pretend â™ª

â™ª That I can face the end â™ª

â™ª How can I go on â™ª

â™ª Won't you stay â™ª

â™ª And now what can I do â™ª

â™ª I just can't live without you â™ª

â™ª You're always on my mind â™ª

â™ª So, where can I hide â™ª

â™ª From all this pain inside, ooh baby â™ª

â™ª I still love you â™ª

Hey, big guy.

Hey.

Look, um,

everybody at work's been asking about you.

You know, they want to know
when you're gonna be back.

What do you think I should tell them?

I don't care.

You look bad, Rob.

Your point?

I want to help you.

You've been helping.

Look, you run the business
as well as I ever did.

I just need you to keep doing it for me.

Okay, but we still need you back.

Did you see this?

Yeah, I saw it.

I talked to your mom.

How does something like
that happen, you know?

How does a murder not even go to court?

The system's fucked, Rob.

Okay?

Jesus Christ, I mean,
that's all it takes

to absolve a drunk driver,

is just pick up some
trash and see a doctor.

I know there's an irony
in there somewhere,

I just can't see it.

Look, it's been almost a year Rob.

Okay?

I mean, there's nothing to grasp.

You got to let it go.

Is there anything that I can do?

Just keep doing what you've been doing.

I really appreciate it.

All right.

Listen, you know,

you know that I'm here for you, right?

Take care.

(ominous orchestral music)

(train whistle blowing)

(TV playing in distance)

(sad orchestral music)

(girls screaming)

You did it!

You killed her!

You killed her!

She was all I had, everything, everything.

I'm sorry man, I'm so sorry.

Everything I ever wanted.

She was all I ever wanted.

I finally found someone that was perfect.

Never know what that was
before. She wanted me.

She loved me, wanted me to marry her.

I was supposed to marry her.

I promised, and you took her away.

You took her away from me.

My wife.

No!

Why?

She was everything.

Don't you know what that means?

What you did.

Yes.

I know.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

She loved me.

I know.

(car beeping)

(gun clicks)

(gun clicks)


(solemn instrumental music)

Woo!

Hi, Rob.

I missed you, Rob.

Leslie.

I love you so much.

But I saw-

Shh.

It doesn't matter, anymore.

I'm here.

But you can't be here.

Forget about all that.

I'm here.

I wanted to see you again.

Just to be with you again.

It doesn't matter anymore, Rob.

I'm here.

But how?

I don't understand, how?

No more questions, Rob.

You've always believed in me before.

It's all right.

Let's just be together again.

Come on.

(enchanted music)

Are you real?

That's a question of definition,

but I am here with you.

Is that enough?

It's always been enough.

It's been everything.


Again.

(sentimental orchestral music)

Hey, what's wrong?

It's too soon.

What is it, baby?

I have to go.

You can't go.

You just got back.

You can't.

It's not up to me. I have to go.

You can't leave me again.

I want to marry you.

I promised I'd marry you.

I wish I could stay forever,

but I can't Rob, I have to go now.

Leslie, I love you.

You're all I want.

All I've ever wanted.

You can't leave me.

If you leave me.

There's nothing else for me, nothing left.

If I could stay, you know, I would Rob.

I do love you completely,

but I can't stay.

I have to go.

Please, you can't leave me.

I want to marry you.

That's all that matters, now.

I believe everything.

All of it.

Please, Leslie.

I'm sorry, Rob.

There's someone out there for you.

A person, someone to live for.

Find her.

I promise you everything will work out.

Whatever happens, just believe in me.

That's what brought me
back to you tonight.

Please, don't leave me.

Everything I ever did,

everything I ever was, was because of you.

I need you, Leslie.

Forgive your father, Rob.

He's suffering just like you are.

And he needs a son.

You need a father.

Goodbye, Rob.

You taught me what cytalia was.

And then you showed me.

I'll always love you.

Always.

Take me with you.

â™ª Every time it seems I have to leave youâ™ª

â™ª It seems harder than
it was the time before â™ª

â™ª Our love's not lost â™ª

â™ª It still grows here inside me â™ª

â™ª And now it keeps me warm â™ª

â™ª With you every morn â™ª

â™ª Though I've left your world â™ª

â™ª I'll watch over you â™ª

â™ª And guide you all I can â™ª

Rob?

Hi, dad.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm all right.

Better than that I think.

Good.

I'm glad I, I was,

I worry about you, that's all.

I know.

I'm okay now.

Yeah, I wasn't there for awhile,

but I worked everything
out, I'm all right.

I just had so many
things I had to work out,

and I wanted so much to blame someone.

I blamed drinking, so I blamed you.

It was so easy.

I just took all the
differences that we had

and I just let it feed off of me.

I was wrong to shut you out.

Sorry.

I know you wanted to help me, I saw that,

but I just didn't want to
let anybody get too close.

I just thought it would hurt too much.

I don't drink anymore.

Your mother and I loved her too, Rob.

When she died, we wanted so
much to be there for you,

but you didn't want me around.

And I wanted to help,
you have to know that.

It hit me when they said how drunk he was,

and I knew that you felt
it could have been me,

that I could have killed her.

I knew that was why you hated me.

Maybe I felt I even deserved it, I guess.

Never again. I promise.

All the things that we missed out on,

I can never make that up to you.

But, I'll try.

It'll be nice to have a father.

I do love you, dad.

I love you, too. I'm so sorry.

[Rob] None of that matters, now.

Rob?

How you doing?

Things are good, it's better now.

That's good, I was worried.

I know.

Things had to work themselves out.

They had a strange way of doing it.

I'm okay.

Business good?

Oh, yeah.

Well, I'm gonna be back on Monday

ready to work you silly.

I'm already silly.

I'll see you Monday.

Come on, you gotta put on your outfit.

In a minute.

Who was that?

An old friend.

He didn't sound that old.

Let me see this.

Why do I have to be the Cuban?

The concubine.

You're the concubine.

I'm the King, she's the Queen,

and you're the concubine.

It's kind of like the
King's favorite super model.

Oh.

And what am I?

I have no idea.

(something small clinks to pavement

Excuse me, miss.

Yes?

You dropped this.

Beautiful, but I'm afraid it's not mine.

I think, maybe it is.
