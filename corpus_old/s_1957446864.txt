<i>Hi. I'm Jon.</i>

<i>I'm a musical-theater writer.</i>

<i>One of the last of my species.</i>


<i>Sorry. Soâ€¦ so, you know, lately,
I've been hearing this sound.</i>

[slow ticking]

<i>Everywhere I go,
like a tick, tick, tickâ€¦</i>

<i>Like a time bomb in some cheesy B-movie
or Saturday morning cartoon.</i>

<i>The fuse has been lit.
The clock counts down the seconds</i>

<i>as the flame gets closer,
and closer, and closer,</i>

<i>untilâ€¦ all at onceâ€¦</i>


[mimicking trumpets]


[mimicking trumpets]


<i>Happy anniversary, I love you so much.</i>


<i>Before the Pulitzer Prize.</i>

{\an8}<i>Beforeâ€¦</i>

<i>We dedicate this opening night
and every performance</i>

<i>to our friend, Jonathan Larson.</i>

[cheers]
[woman] <i>â€¦we lost him.</i>

[both scream]

<i>you're about to see is true.</i>

<i>Except for the parts Jonathan made up.</i>

[jovial tune playing]

{\an8}The date is January 26th, 1990.

{\an8}<i>The setting, the barren,
unfashionable no-man's-land</i>

<i>between SoHo and Greenwich Village.</i>

I have two keyboards,
a Macintosh computer.

<i>- A cat.</i>
[meows]

<i>An impressive collection of compact discs,</i>

<i>cassettes, and records
of other people's music.</i>

<i>Bookshelves sagging under the weight
of plays and novels I didn't write.</i>

<i>I have an original,
dystopian rock musicalâ€¦</i>

[tune stops]

â€¦that I have spent the last eight years
of my life writingâ€¦

[deep breathing]

<i>- â€¦and rewriting, and rewriting.</i>
[laughter]


I have rejection letters
from every major and minor producer,

theater company, record label,
and film studio in existence.

And in just over a weekâ€¦

I will be 30 years old.

<i>Older than Stephen Sondheim
when he had his first Broadway show.</i>

<i>Older than Paul McCartney when
he wrote his last song with John Lennon.</i>

<i>By the time my parents were 30,
they already had two kids,</i>

<i>they had careers</i>

with steady paychecks, a mortgage.

<i>And in eight days,
my youth will be over forever.</i>

And what exactly do I have
to show for myself?


Happy birthday!

<i>â™ª Stop the clock â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Time to regroup â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Before you lose the bout â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Freeze the frame â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Back it up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Time to refocus â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Before they wrap it up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feel like you're treading water â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't fight it, like taxes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At least it happens
Only once in your life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They're singing "Happy Birthday" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You just want to lay down and cry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not just another birthday, it's 30/90 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why can't you stay 29? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hell, you still feel like you're 22 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Turn 30, 1990 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bang! You're dead
What can you do? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What can you do? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What can you do? â™ª</i>

I made ten copies.

You are an angel on earth.

This is the last time. Seriously.
I know. Thank you.

No, no, no, I got you.
I'm gonna pay.

[Jon] I don't want you to pay.
Somebody needs to take out this trash.

So I hear you're moving
out of Jon's place.

That's the end of an era.

We hear him sobbing in the fridge
most mornings. It's very sad.

We are not talking about that.

Wait, Carolyn,
you're coming next Friday, right?

What's happening Friday?

[both] The <i>Superbia</i> workshop.
Surprised he hasn't mentioned it.

That sounds vaguely familiar.

Guys, this is the biggest break
I've ever had. This is that moment.

It's the first time people are gonna
see the show that aren't just us.

It's good you're not putting
too much pressure on it.

[all chuckling]
[Jon] But it's true, though.

It's like, you get to a certain age and
you stop being a writer who waits tables

and you become a waiter with a hobby.

Boo-Boo, you need to ask yourself,
in this moment,

are you letting yourself
be led by fear or by love?

<i>â™ª Feel like a cleanup batter â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On a team that ain't a winner â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't freak out, don't strike out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't fight it, like City Hall â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At least you're not alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your friends are there too â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And they're singing "Happy Birthday" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You just wish you could run away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who cares about a birthday? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But 30/90, hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can you be optimistic? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're no longer the ingÃ©nue â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Turn 30, 1990 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Boom! You're passÃ© â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What can you do? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What can you do? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What can you do? â™ª</i>

You just quit?

Well, no, I didn't just "quit" quit.
I gaveâ€¦ I gave my notice.

That's exactly the same thing.
No, I have two weeks left.

I'm allowing myself to be led by love.

What?

You know, Rosa's got another client.
Craig Carnelia.

This is Rosa your agent,
who hasn't returned your calls in a year?

Yeah, yeah. That's the one.

So she invited the entire theater industry
to Craig's musical workshop last year.

And by intermission, some producer

had already written him
a check for ten thousand dollars.

I just wish that
you didn't have to think like that.

Well, it's expensive to make art.

No, baby, it's expensive to make art here.

Yeah, but worth every penny.
[chuckles]

That's beautiful.
I know, right?

How are you gonna pay for this, Jonathan?

Friday night.

[machine beeps]
<i>- Hi, Jonathan, it's Deborah.</i>

<i>Susan dropped off your music
for tonight's dance...</i>

[tape rewinds]
<i>â€¦but I can't get the speakers to work.</i>

[door opens]

Hey, Pookie.
Hi.

How was Philly?

I went from the airport
to a conference room

and then back to the airport
three hours later.

Sounds amazing.
Mm.


Yeah, he was the lead of every play
in high school, college.

And then we moved to New York.

I am sick of waking up at 5:00

to get in line outside
the Equity Building and wait all day,

praying that the director
actually even agrees

to see anyone that's non-union, and then,

when I finally do get in the room, I singâ€¦

I don't know, six measures,
if I'm lucky, before they cut me off

and call me the wrong name...

Juan, Pedro, Carlos<i>â€¦ lo que sea</i>.

And then a week later, he got a job
at a fancy advertising company,

making high five figures. [exhales]

Healthcare, dentalâ€¦

He never looked back.

You know, for someone who's broke,

you could probably spend
a little bit less on party planning.


if you're not gonna spend it
on the people you love?

Yeah, except you don't have any money.
Oh, right.

This has been sitting here for a week.

I'm on it.
Mm-hm. Yeah. You seem very on it.

Pretty soon you won't have me around
to remind you to pay your bills on time.

How will I ever survive?

That's a very real question.
Have you found a new roommate yet?

I've been a little busy. You know.
My workshop is next week.

Wait, what workshop?


That was funny.


Uhâ€¦

Curtain's at 8:00.
[Michael] Mmâ€¦

I've heard the dancing's amazing,
but the music sucks.

[piano playing chords]

<i>in a small town in the Midwest.</i>

<i>She went to college to study biology,</i>

<i>she thought she'd become
a doctor, maybe teach.</i>

<i>- But then she fell in love</i>â€¦
[all gasping]

â€¦<i>with modern dance instead.</i>
[all exhale]

Every parent's dream, right?
[faint laughter]

<i>She moved to New York
without knowing a soul.</i>

<i>Four years later, she's already danced</i>

<i>with every major choreographer
in the city.</i>

<i>Paul, Trisha, Merce.</i>

1990. This was the year
she was finally gonna join a company.

<i>Not just go from job to job.
Actually have a home, an artistic family.</i>

<i>And she was ready.
This was her year. She knew it.</i>

And then she fractured her ankle
during a dress rehearsal.

[piano continues playing]

<i>she's dancing again, it's justâ€¦</i>

<i>Whatever that moment was, when she knewâ€¦</i>

<i>All of a sudden, she doesn't know anymore.</i>


But Susan is a real artist.

She doesn't care about seeing her name
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

<i>It doesn't matter to her
if she's dancing in front of five people</i>

<i>or in front of five thousand.</i>

[slow ticking]

<i>And then there's the matter of us.</i>


Whoo!

["Love Shack" by B-52s playing]

<i>â™ª Love shack
Baby, love shack â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Love shack
Baby, love shackâ€¦ â™ª</i>

You know he can't
afford all of this, right?

[indistinct chatter]

Well, he loves making a fuss,
especially about you.

Hm.

["Love Shack" continues playing]

After everything we've done for himâ€¦

[Jon] Stop!
â€¦he walks away.

Freddy, look, I'm leaving you my mixtapes.

Oh!
You can play them in remembrance of me.

Jonathan Larson's famous
Moondance Diner mixtape.

Who doesn't love showtunes
with their French toast?

Actually, it's not just showtunes.
It's a very eclectic mix.

Someone's very touchy about mixtapes.
Apparently.

Okay, listen. I'm happy for you.

I really am.
Oh, yeah?

I'm also extremely bitter
and jealous and envious,

and sort of hateful towards you right now.

I meanâ€¦ he's getting out.

And you're gonna be next.

Well, I got a callback last week.
Great!

For a cruise.
What's wrong with a cruise?


It's an Arctic cruise,
so pretty much everything.

Uh, every single thing is wrong with that.
It's in the Arctic.

How you feeling?
Umâ€¦

It's been a really good week.

T-cell count is good.
My doctor feels cautiously optimistic.

Okay, good. You look great.

Oh, my God, thank you. I know.

[chuckles softly]

But for the cruise,
I'm gonna have to sort ofâ€¦

Tighten up. Pull it, pull it up.
Make it tight.

Scott and I, we used to sing madrigals
in high school.

What? Really?
[Scott] Yeah, yeah.

I hated singing.
I just did it for the pussy. [laughs]

Ran into Scott in SoHo and he reallyâ€¦
<i>really</i> wanted to come.

Got it. Got it.

I never get to go
to artist parties, you know?

It sucks.
The drugs there are always the best.

Mm. Mm-hmâ€¦

Scott's in finance.
Shocking.

Yeah. What do you do?
I'm the future of musical theater, Scott.

Welcome. I'm gonna get another drink.

That guy's hilarious.

Whoa.

Hi. Everyone's leaving.

I just needed some fresh air.
Okay.

It's freezing up here.

[Jon shuddering]

Where is your coat?

Oh, I don't know. It's, uhâ€¦

It's at the bottom of a very large pile.

Oh!

Mm.

[sighing deeply]


That's the prison barge.

Oh, yeah.
[both laugh]

I heard, uh, in Jacob's Pillow, they're
hiring new teachers for the dance school.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Work a couple of hours a week.
Then the rest of the time is yours.

Free studio space whenever you want.
Heyâ€¦ Whoaâ€¦

Can we just talk for a second?
Mm.

Can we just talk about
how amazing you were tonight?

Thank you.
I am not messing around.

I could just watch you dancing forever.

I was thinking of maybe applying.

Hm?
To the job in Jacob's Pillow.

We went there last summer, remember?
Oh.

We saw the new Mark Morris.

Oh, yeah!
Yeah.

That's the place in the Berkshires?
Mm-hm.

So, you're gonna move to the Berkshires?

And not have to work
30 hours a week doing word processing

to pay the rent, why not?

I might actually be able
to get back into shape.

Okay. Yeah. All right.
Let's do it. Let's move.

I'm being serious.
Hey, I'm being serious.

We're gonna live in a log cabin.
We're gonna huntâ€¦ acorns.

We're gonna... [spluttering]
We're gonna gather squirrels.

What are you even talking about?

[laughs]
It's the Berkshires.

People have vacation homes there.
You've been there.

I'm so sorry.
Can we... Can we please go inside?

Sorry, I just feel like I'm scared...

I'm beginning
to lose sensation in my extremities.

You are such a baby.

Take this.


[exhales deeply]
You like?

I thought that you were in a hurry
to get back inside.

[R&B music playing loudly]

[muffled music]
[moans through wall]

You know that job in the Berkshires?

Yeah, sounds amazing.
I already applied for it.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

And I got it.
Ohâ€¦

Oh, yeah? That's great.
Yeah.

It starts in June.

Okay. So this is just for the summer?

No. Mm-mm, it's permanent.

Jon?

Whoa, the Berkshires?

That is, like, so far from Midtown.

[pained chuckle] Yeah. Yeah.

Why is she doing this right now?

And she says,
"I want you to come with me."

What did you say?
I said, "Oh?"


What am I supposed to say?
I didn't know what to say.

I mean, like, I can'tâ€¦
I can't leave New York.

Oh, tell her to move in with you.
Move in where?

You need a new roommate, right?

It's two birds, one stone.
You are very welcome.

Okay, so, whatâ€¦ what about the guy
that you were dating? David?

I thought you guys were great together.
It didn't work out.

Oh. There's a focus group
at the office this week,

and they're looking for a few more people.
How about I sign you up?

So you can lure me to the dark side?

No! So I can introduce you
to my colleagues,

and show them how brilliant you are.

I don't want a job in advertising.

I don't want you
to have a job in advertising.

I want you to have a job inâ€¦
jingle writing.

[laughs]
No, listen.

You come up with jingles
all the time for fun, Jon.

You come up with songs
about cereal we're eating.

[sighs]
You could get paid for that.

Well, you know,
when <i>Superbia</i> gets produced,

I will be getting paid
for my music anyway. Soâ€¦

That's true.

Home sweet home.

Ohâ€¦ myâ€¦ God!

to me before. Iâ€¦ [sighs]

I don't know.
I usually write a song in a day.

Last week, I wrote a song about sugar.
It took me three hours.

Song about sugar?
<i>- â™ª Sugar â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She is refined
For a small price â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She blows my mind â™ª</i>

Why would you do that?

An exercise.

In what?

I like to see
if I can write a song about anything.

Why don't you try to see
if you can write a song for your musical

that's being presented
to an audience in six days instead?

<i>musical theater at Playwrights Horizons.</i>

<i>The first, and so far,
only actual theater person</i>

<i>to offer to put on a workshop of</i> Superbia.

I'm starting to think
that maybe I don't need it.

You do need it.
You knowâ€¦ [crunching]

â€¦you're the only person
who ever said that.

Just so you know.

You're telling me in the five years
you've been writing this musicalâ€¦

Eight years, actually.

â€¦no one else has told you
that you're missing a song

for Elizabeth in the second act?

No one.



<i>of this musical theater writing workshop.</i>

<i>â™ª Liquid crystal digital readout â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Floating on a sea of gray â™ª</i>

<i>surviving members of our dwindling tribe.</i>

<i>We'd watch one of us present what

<i>Real writers.</i>

<i>The theater legends,

<i>that we'd grown up dragging our parents

<i>â™ª Dividing the day away â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Counting slowly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Measuring momentsâ€¦ â™ª</i>

<i>people began to buzz</i>

<i>as soon as we walked through the door.</i>

Is it really him?

It was.

<i>Stephen Sondheim.</i>

[laughter]
[man] All right, I'll start.

I'm lost.

Iâ€¦ I don't know what the show is.

Is it social commentary?
Is it science fiction?

And the music is the same thing.
Is it rock? Is it Broadway? Is it both?

Is it neither? Steve, what did you think?

I have to say,
I disagree pretty strongly, Walter.

I think this is a musical
that knows exactly what it is.

Yes. Yes. Of course, yes. Abso...

The world that you've created
is really original.

It's fascinating.

The problem is, it's not particularly easy
to follow the emotional thread.

The details distract us
from connecting with the characters.

Does that make sense?
Okay. Okay.

Yes, yes. We're on the same page.
That's exactly how I felt.

We're saying the same thing,
just differently.

But the music, okay, I'm sorry...
The music just wasn't there.

I actually...
I thought the songs were swell.

Yeah, okayâ€¦ Yes. Yes.
The <i>individual </i>songs.

I particularly like the one the young man
sings at the end of the first act.

First rate lyric and tune. Well done.


Thank you.

Those five words were enough
to keep me going for the next two years.

You're missing a song
for the young woman. Uhâ€¦

Elizabeth?
Elizabeth.

It's the turning point in the show.

Your protagonist is either gonna go
in this direction or that direction.

Someone has to wake him up,
shake some sense into him.

Okay.

gonna say the exact same thing.

Can we talk musicians?
Because if it's only gonna be four,

then I gotta figure out how
I'm gonna split up the bass parts.

This is for you. Here you go.

Thank you.
Yeah. Uhâ€¦

Jon, this is a reading.
Mm.

You'll have a piano.

I wrote a rock score.

So, at the very least I'll need a synth
and drums and a guitar and...

A great song should sound great
without any instruments.

Mm. Okay.

Let's just do the song as a cappella.

Oh, actually, you know what?
Maybe we'll just skip the songs,

and then we can get the audience
in and out in half an hour.

I will take a look at the budget

and I will see if I can dig up
some money for another musician.

Two more.

And piano is the absolute
bare minimum for this.

Have you spoken to Rosa?

Hey, Rosa, this is Jonathan Larson,
your client.

I've left multiple messages
with your secretary.

Rosa Stevens is still your agent, right?
Oh, yeah. No, yeah, weâ€¦

We talk constantly.

Has she sent out the invites
for the presentation yet?

We haven't gotten a lot of RSVPs.

It's fine.
Mm.

Nobody has more contacts
in the industry than Rosa.

I'm sure she'll get some
good people there for you.

Yeah, yeah.

I'll see you Monday.
Yes, sir.

First day of rehearsal.

And finish the song already. Please.

Thank you, Ira.
Thanks.

Thank you for all this. Thank you.

[entry bell chimes]

[slow, quiet ticking]

[ticking intensifies]

Yeah. I want to leave a message
for Mr. Sondheim.

This is, umâ€¦ my name is Jonathan Larson.

Hi there, this is a message for Joe Papp.

For Bernie Gersten.

For the Artistic Director
of the Shubert Organization.

For La MaMa. So, it's Larson, L-A-R-S-O-N.

No, not Parson. It's something
that's never been done before.

It's gonna be quite the event.

It has tremendous commercial possibility.

We're filling up fast.
I want to make sure you got your spot.

I know that his time is limited.
Oh! It would be such a treat!

Zero pressure.
Ha-ha. I really want you there.

So, can I count you in?
There'll be a seat reserved for him.

<i>Superbia</i> at Playwrights Horizons.
It's at 10:00 a.m.

This Friday at 10:00 a.m.
I'm so excited about Friday.

I wouldn't want you to miss it.
That's all the information I can give you.

I guess it changed.

Shit.

He's gonna be fine.

He's a pain in the ass.

Monday morning.

My first day of rehearsals
for the <i>Superbia</i> workshop, which is still,

in case you'd forgotten, missing its
crucial Act Two musical number.


I make my way there

The Theater District.

<i>â™ª So why do I want
To play the play game? â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª That's the play game â™ª
â™ª That's the play game â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I must be insane
To play the play game â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Even off Broadway
It's no guarantee â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That some MBA
Won't decide what you see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just like America, lackin' innovation â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just gettin' by
On glitz and reputation â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just like America, on the decline â™ª</i>

So what if it's crap? â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>At least you won't write for free â™ª</i>

I'll be auditioning for the role

On behalf of Playwrights Horizons,
I want to welcome everyone

and thank you all for taking part
in this very exciting new musical

by a very exciting young writer,
Jonathan Larson.

[cheering, clapping]

He's not even 30.

Oh, wow. Thank you, Ira.

Umâ€¦ this is the first real workshop
that this musical has ever had.

And now you guys are part of the family.

So, any questions
before we, uh, get going?

Yeah, no. Yeah.
[woman] Umâ€¦

Could youâ€¦ umâ€¦
Could you explain it, maybe?

Yeah. Explain what?

Oh, just the musical. The story.

It's a little, um, confusing
in certain places. Not in a bad way.

<i>Superbia,</i> a satire set in the future
on a poisoned planet Earth,

where the vast majority of humanity
spend their entire lives

just staring at the screens
of their media transmitters,

watching the tiny elite
of the rich and powerful,

who film their own fabulous lives
like TV shows.

A world where human emotion
has been outlawed.

This will be the first musical written
for the MTV generation.

This is my...

Is it supposed to be aliens?
I wasn't sure if it was all, like, aliens.

Nope, not aliens. Umâ€¦
But it is set in the future.

[upbeat melody plays]

<i>â™ª The color scheme for the day
Is black-red-black â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The drug, of course
Will be the kilowatt â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The trend today is to say
The adjective "fun" a lot â™ª</i>

It's perfect. Keep going. Keep going.

<i>â™ª Studd star, you have received
Two nominations â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª "Face of the Year"
And "Best Hair" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Prepare a speech
For your photo opportunity â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your agent Tim Pursent will be there â™ª</i>

I love it. I love it.

[Ira] You told me you needed a drummer.
[Jon] Oh, my goodness.

Good night. Wonderful work.
Really wonderful work.

Noâ€¦ [strained laughter]
Iâ€¦ I told you I needed a band.

It's 100 dollars for every musician.

Yeah. And your annual operating budget
is half a million dollars?

So far we're up to 12 RSVPs, Jon.

You don't need a band
with an audience of 12 people.

You'll outnumber them.

If you want more musicians,

you're gonna have to find
the money for it somewhere else.

I'm sorry.

Thank you for everything.

Oh, no. It is. It is.

Okay. It's Tuesday.

Mmâ€¦

I need to give them the decision
about the job by tomorrow, soâ€¦

Is there a moment
where you can take a break?

I can't. No, the actors take breaks.
I don'tâ€¦ I don't have any breaks.

I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Soâ€¦

Umâ€¦

Can youâ€¦ Can you ask for an extension?

I'm sorry, can weâ€¦
Can we talk about this tonight?

Jesus, Jonathan.
[sighs]

I need you to talk to me.

I'm writing, Susan. I'm writing.

You're gonna write a great
American musical in the next ten minutes?

Thank you for being
so supportive of my work.

such a champion of mine?

What's that supposed to mean?
What do you think it means?

And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we present you withâ€¦

[drum roll]

â€¦scenes from a modern
romance as told in song.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I...

I'm not allowed to talk about my needs.
What needs?

Did I say that?
You didn't have to say it. It's implied.

How is it implied?

You're the artist and I'm the girlfriend.
That's how you feel, right?

<i>â™ª I feel bad
That you feel bad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª About me feeling bad
About you feeling bad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª About what I said
About what you said â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª About me not being able â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To share a feeling â™ª</i>

Can we talk about this later, please?
When, Jonathan? When is later?

Not tonight.

<i>â™ª If I thought that
What you thought â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Was that I hadn't thought
About sharing my thoughts â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then my reaction
To your reaction â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To my reaction
Would have been more revealing â™ª</i>

I have been rehearsing all day.
I have been up since four this morning.

I have been trying to write a song
for a week and I am nowhere.

<i>â™ª I was afraid that you'd be afraid â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I told you that
I was afraid of intimacy â™ª</i>

I've been telling you
how unhappy I am for months.

<i>â™ª If you don't have a problem
With my problem â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Maybe the problem's
Simply co-dependency â™ª</i>

Everyone's unhappy in New York!
That's what New York is!

<i>- â™ª I was wrong to â™ª
â™ª Say you were wrong to â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Say I was wrong about â™ª
â™ª You being wrong â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª When you rang to say â™ª
â™ª The ring was the wrong thing to bring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I meant what I said
When I said "rings bored me" â™ª</i>

I don't know how
to get through to you anymore.

You keep shutting me out,
you keep putting up these fences.

I'm not. I'm not shutting you out.
You're a million miles away all the time.

Actually, I'm right here.
Are you, Jonathan?

Actually? Because I know you.

<i>â™ª I'm not mad
That you got mad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I got mad
When you said I should go drop dead â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I were you
And I'd done what I'd done â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd do what you did
When I gave you the ring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Having said what I said â™ª</i>

You're right. I've been distracted,
but I promise you, after the workshop...

After the workshop.

After the workshop!

Everything is after the workshop.

Yeah.

What if the workshop happens
and nothing changes?

No producer with a big check.

You don't go straight to Broadway.

You're still a waiter, you're still living
in this apartment, you're still broke.

What then, Jonathan? What about me?

<i>â™ª I feel bad that you feel bad
About me feeling bad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª About you feeling bad about what I said
About what you said â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª About me not being
Able to share a feeling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feeling badly about you â™ª</i>

I can't move to the Berkshires.


I can't leave my career behind.

You think I don't know that?

What?

What are youâ€¦? What is this?
What do you want?

[dry chuckle]

I guess I justâ€¦
I wanted you to tell me not to go.

<i>â™ª If I thought that what you thought â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Was I hadn't thought
About sharing my thoughts â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then my reaction to your reaction
To my reaction â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Would have been more revealing â™ª
â™ª When I reacted to you â™ª</i>

Of course I don't want you to go.

Really?
Obviously.

'Cause this is the first time
you've ever said it.

Oh, my God.

<i>â™ª Now it's out in the open â™ª</i>

You're thinking about how you can
turn this into a song. Aren't you?

<i>â™ª Now it's off our chest â™ª</i>

No. What?

You know what, Jonathan? I'm done.

Susan? Susan, wait.

I hope that you have an amazing workshop.

Susan, hold on. Susan?

<i>â™ª Now it's 4:00 a.m.
And we have therapy tomorrow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's too late to screw â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So let's just get some rest â™ª</i>

[cheering, applause]

[horn beeps]

[ticking starts]

[horn honking in the distance]

So, just waiting on one more person.

[tired sigh]
Enjoy those waters.


Soâ€¦
[door opens]

I'm Jon.

Yes, Mr. Larson, you're Michael's friend.
Yeah.

How are you?
Good. You're late.

Oh.
Okay.

Sorry about that.
That's okay.

No, because of the subway.
Yeah, I'm sure.

Take a seat when you can.

Hi.
Welcome.

Oh. Thanks.

You sure there's no way
to get into the bathroom?

Oh, no, you're not allowed
to use the bathroom.

Sorry, did she mention
when we were gonna get paid?

Okay, um, so now that we're all hereâ€¦

Hi.
Hey.

Why don't we begin
with a quick brainstorming session? Right?

Just to get those creative juices flowing.
You know what I mean? It'll be fun.

Two hours of this.

For one extra musician.
[laughter]

So why don't we start
by you just throwing out some ideas

when you hear me say the word "America."

George Washington.
Excellent.

Abraham Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln. Okay.

Empire, racism, genocide, Vietnam.

Grover Cleveland.

The Constitution?
Yes.

Yeah.
Magna Carta.

The Bill of Rights.
Mm-hm.

The right thing to do.
Ooh.

[older woman] The right stuff.
Right stuff.

An open road at sunset.

Wind in your hair.

Nothing in your way, except horizon.

That is beautiful, Mr. Larson.

Wow. Okay. That goes on the board.

The sun.
Sunrise.

The dawn of a new day.

Oh! Where did you come from?
It all goes back.

You're amazing.
That is incredible.

A window looking out on a field.

Oh, and I look out, and I see
the bunnies and little squirrelies...

The beating heart of the nation.

Ooh!
[director] Oh, my gosh.

Absolutely. That's absolutely what it is.
Beautiful.

I've never even heard that before.
You are gifted.

I could get used to this.


I could get health care. A 401(k).

A BMW. A luxury apartmentâ€¦
on Central Park West.

No, no, noâ€¦ East.
[laughter]

<i>I could actually be rewarded
for my creativity,</i>

instead of rejected and ignored.

This could be the rest of my life.

Now that we have all those
fabulous ideas of yours in our heads,

we are going to turn to the task at hand.

We are here to develop a name
of a revolutionary consumer product

that is just about to hit your shelves.

Oh. Wow.

This is where we're gonna need

that incredible imagination
of yours, Mr. Larson.

So the product we're looking at
is a tasteless, odorless chemical compound

that will be used as
a fat substitute in cooking.

Mm.

And it's been successfully tested
on a number of mammals.

Well, that's good. Mm.

There are some side effects
associated with the product

that I've been instructed
to tell you about.

So it's skin scales.

Umâ€¦ full hair loss.

Hair, eyebrows, eyelashesâ€¦
[ominous music plays]

This could be the rest of my life.

And finally, in a small number of users,

there were reports
of toxic shock syndromeâ€¦

Resulting in a brief hospitalization.

[man] Eh, no big deal.
There are no bad ideas.

[ticking starts]

Free oil.
Love it.

Oil free.
Okay.

That's the same thing she just said.
I switched the words around.

Thank you so much.

The American Dream.
Okay, wellâ€¦

[Kim] Dreams of freedom.
Okay.

[man] Nutra-oil.
That's not bad, Todd.


[ticking intensifies]
[dialogue fades]

[discordant music builds]

I got it.

[laughs triumphantly]

I have it. I have the exact...
Go, go!

You wanna hear? I got the exact
right thing for this product.

Chubstitute.


It's a joke.
It's not funny.

Well, maybe not to you but...
I recommended you, Jon.

I put my name on the line for you.

Tell them I had a stroke.
It isn't funny.

This is my life.

No, it's not your life, it's advertising.

It's figuring out how to trick people

into buying shit that they don't want.

Actually, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

I don't understand how
you can take any of this seriously.

Because they pay me to.
Money isn't everything.

Well, it doesn't hurt.
Are you sure about that?

What are you doing with your life
that's so noble?

I'm making art.
That's what the world needs. More art.

Actually, yes. And at least
I'm not perpetuating a system that's...

Spare the self-righteousness, Jon.

You're writing musicals
in your living room,

you're not saving the rainforest.


Gosh, I wish I could be more like you,

and spend my life caring
about driving the right car

and wearing the right suits
and living in a doorman building.

Why shouldn't I want those things, Jon?
Not all of us have options you do.

All the things that you take for granted.

What? Like what?
Like a life with the person you love.

Do you know what I would give for that?
You... You turn your nose up at it.

If that's what you want,
what's stopping you?

What's stopping me? How about
Jesse Helms and the Moral Majority?

How about the people
that run this country?

I can't get married. I can't have kids.

Half our friends are dying and the other
half are scared to death they are next.

So, I'm sorry for getting a nice car, Jon.

I'm sorry for moving into
an apartment with central heating.

I'm sorry for enjoying my life
while I still have time.

I gotta go.

Hey.

You wanna come take the subway?

[Michael] I'd rather walk.
Michael.

Michael.

[phone ringing]

[footsteps approach]
[door opens]

Hello?



<i>- Hello?</i>
Rosa Stevens?

Are we excited for tomorrow?
<i>- Tomorrow?</i>

The presentation.
You remembered the presentation?

Remembered it?
I got every producer in town coming.

[sighs]
[Rosa laughs]

[laughs]
<i>- So it better be good.</i>

Yeah, it's, uhâ€¦ it's gonna be amazing.

Let's see if we can't get
a bidding war started

on this musical of yours. What do you say?

Yes, sure. [laughs nervously]

Okay, doll.

Charlie, get me Hal Prince on the line.

Rosa? Um, I...

[dial tone]

[breathing deeply]

[up-tempo rock music playing]


I'm so sorry.

[door squeaks]

Yeah. I know, I know, I know.

[music stops]

[kettle whistle dying]


Why wouldn't you have called me
to tell me my payment was late

before you just cut off my power?

How is...? How does that make sense?

<i>you received a notice...</i>

No, no, no, listen.

You don't understand. I have a workshop.

I have a public presentation
of my musical in 12 hoursâ€¦

<i>Sir, if you are going to raise your voiceâ€¦</i>

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Look, look, look.
I can pay you over the phone, right now.

I have my credit card right hereâ€¦
<i>- The billing office is closed.</i>

I would love to figure it out right now.

<i>The billing office is closed
for the night.</i>

[breathing heavily]

What am I gonna do?
<i>- Sir, like I've said, call...</i>


[keypad beeping]

[line ringing]

[woman] <i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Beth. Hey.

How are you? It's Jon.

<i>Hi, Jon.</i>

Hi, umâ€¦ is Susan there?

<i>She doesn't wanna talk to you, Jon.</i>

Yeah.

Umâ€¦

Sure, sure. Uhâ€¦

Well, can youâ€¦ umâ€¦
can you give her a message for me?

<i>- What is it?</i>
Well, it's just, you knowâ€¦

I wanted to remind her that tomorrow
is my workshop and you know, Iâ€¦

I know I don't have any right to ask this.
It's just thatâ€¦

I would just really love her to be there.

<i>I'll tell her you called.</i>

[line clicks]


[ticking starts]

The musical to which
I have devoted my youth

is about to be put on public display
for every producer in New York.

[ticking continues]

I haven't written a single note
or a single lyric

of the most important song in the show.

I have no electricity.

My best friend is furious with me.
My girlfriend isn't speaking to me.

And there is only
one thing I can think of to do:

Swim.

[propulsive rock music playing]

<i>â™ª I hate this locker room
Why won't Susan answer my calls? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sweat, wet, echo
Smell, hell, rap â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Pump up the volume
Hot, wet, hot sweat â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How's the water? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stretch, stretch
Spit in the mask â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cloudy vision
Test the water â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Contemplate the dive
The shock to the skin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Anticipate the pain, the pain, the pain
The pain, the pain now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª One, two, three,
Oh, bite the air, seven â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's that girl
One, two, three â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, bite the air
Smooth, soft skin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Two, three
Oh, bite the... Thirteen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Long legs, brown skin and wet hair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa, and wet hair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Has Rosa even listened to my tape? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Kick, stretch, windmill arms
See the hand, point the feet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Wet hair
Relax, this guy's too slow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fifteen
Can I make it to 40? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Too slow
Touch his heel, move! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Answer my calls!
Red thin stripe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fifty feet, sixty feet
She looks like Susan â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Susan's beautiful â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Out, don't think, out, out
Let it out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Keep the shoulder down, down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Easy, not too hard â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Find the movement's origin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hands, no
Shoulder, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Elbows, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lower, from the back
Yes, lower â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thirty-nine, 40 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Center, center â™ª</i>

[atmospheric piano interlude begins]

<i>â™ª Forward motion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Through the water â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Escape â™ª
â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I am soaring â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª I'm the water â™ª
â™ª You're on the air â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª You as the knight â™ª
â™ª I'm underground â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Me as the queen â™ª</i>

[rock music resumes]

[music stops]

[clock ticking]


<i>The room is completely empty.</i>

<i>The show is about to begin,
and I am looking</i>

<i>at 60 empty folding chairs.</i>

[door opens]

[ticking continues]


Hey, boy genius.

[ticking continues]

I'm turning 30 on Sunday, you know.

Oh, well, happy birthday.

Thank you.

Thirty's still young, you know.
No one's here.

Oh. It's not even 9:00.

The presentation doesn't start till 10:00.

[ticking stops]
[sighs with relief]


That's good.

Cool. [laughs]
[laughing]

Okay. [panting]

Can you sight read?
Yeah.


<i>people start to show up.</i>

Johnny.
[Jon] Be right back.

This is phenomenal.
Look at the space, it's just phenomenal.

It's a rehearsal studio, Dad.
It's a Broadway rehearsal studio.

This is the real thing.
We're so excited for you, dear.

Thank you.
Are they paying you?

No.
[sighs]

Next time.
Sure.

[father] Oh, look, for us.
No, that's notâ€¦

That's for someone else, actually.
Mm. Do you like that?

You can literally sit in any other seat.

Okay. Break a leg.
Shall we sit there?

I love you. Thank you.
I love you.

His hair is ridiculous.

[low, indistinct chatter]

Good turnout.

Yeah, mostly friends.

Mm, what a nightmare.

[both chuckle lightly]

Thank youâ€¦ for being here.

Wild horses, Jon. You know that.

Oh! Okay. Break legs.
Yeah.

Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

Ira, you son of a gun.

Jonathan, how are you?
Rosa.

Jon Larson.
Oh, there he is.

Just the man I'm looking for.
You nervous? Don't be nervous.

Yeah. A little nervous. Sure.
Of course you're nervous.

The first presentation of your musical is
like having a colonoscopy in Times Square.

Only with a colonoscopy,
the worst thing that could happen

is you find out you have cancer.

With a musical,
you find out you're already dead.

Have a good show.
Can't wait to see what you did.

We can't keep waiting. It's quarter past.

I know. I know. I know.

Break a leg.
Okay.

Come here. Thank you.


Hello. Hi, welcome.

I'm Jonathan Larson.

[applause, cheering]

Whoaâ€¦ Hey, wellâ€¦

You don't have to do that.
Thank you so much, that was very kind. Uhâ€¦

Thank you for being here,
um, this morning.

This is, umâ€¦
[door shuts]

[whispering] That's Stephen Sondheim.
Right. Like I was sayingâ€¦

Thank you all for being here.
This is my musical, <i>Superbia,</i>

and I've been working on it forâ€¦
a little while now.

[chuckles lightly]

And I just really hope you all like it.

Thank you.


[up-tempo music begins]

And the next hour and a half are a blur.

<i>â™ª Everyone who ever has
Or ever will be anyone will be there â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Never in the history of entertainment
Will there be an affair quite like it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The event of the century â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The quintessential social adventure â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We cannot afford to miss
This night of bliss â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everyone who's anyone knows
Everyone who's anyone knows â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everyone who's anyone
Everyone who's anyone knows â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everyone will be there â™ª</i>

And thenâ€¦

Karessa steps forward to sing my new song.

<i>Not even 12 hours old.</i>

<i>I close my eyes.</i>

<i>I brace myself.</i>

<i>I don't dare take a breath.</i>

[lilting melody plays]

<i>But when I open my eyesâ€¦</i>

<i>I don't see Karessa there.</i>

<i>â™ª You're on the air â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm underground â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Signal's fading â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't be found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I finally open up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For you, I would do anything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But you've turned off the volume â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just when I've begun to sing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Defenses are not the way to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you know, or at least you knew â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't you recall when this all began â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was only you and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was only me and you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I have to laugh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We sure put on a show â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Love is passÃ© in this day and age â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How can we expect it to grow? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You as the knight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Me as the queen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I've got tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is static on a screen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses
Suspense is fine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you're just an empty image â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Emanating out of a screen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, be real
You can feel again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You don't need a music box melody â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To know what I mean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Deep in my eyes
What do you see? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Deep in my sighs
Listen to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let the music commence from inside â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not only one sense, but use all five â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Come to your senses, yeah â™ª
â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, come back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Alive â™ª</i>

[clapping, cheering]

Whoo!

[breathing shakily]

[phone rings]

Hello?
<i>- Hi, honey, it's Rosa.</i>

Hi, Rosa. Thank you so much for calling.

Well, you already left six messages.

So have you heard anything yet?

Honey, I have heard nothing
but raves all day long.

I'm getting call after call after call.

Wow. [chuckles]

Okay. Yes! That's great news.

Everyone is telling me the same thing.
"That Jonathan Larson!"

"I can't wait to see what he does next."

What do you mean, what I do next?
What about <i>Superbia?</i>

I always told you, it was a tough sell.

It's too arty for Broadway.

<i>Tourists aren't gonna shell out 50 dollars</i>

<i>to see a show about spaceships and robots.</i>

Umâ€¦ That's not what it's about. Umâ€¦

<i>Well, of course, I know that, Jonathan.</i>

But you know these producers, they care
about one thing and one thing only.

Okay. Uhâ€¦ So what about Off-Broadway?

It's too expensive for Off.

<i>You got a cast of thousands,
with the special effectsâ€¦</i>

<i>Uhâ€¦ Charlie, tell himÂ I'll be on in a sec.</i>

<i>- Listen, sweetie, I gotta run.</i>
I'm sorry, Rosaâ€¦

Congratulations
on a terrific presentation.

<i>Rosa, Rosa, hold on.</i>

So, okayâ€¦

So what am I supposed to do now?

You start writing the next one.

<i>And after you finish that one,
you start on the next.</i>

And on and on, and that's
what it is to be a writer, honey.

<i>You just keep throwing them
against the wall</i>

<i>and hoping against hope
that eventually, something sticks.</i>

[phone beeps]

Listen.

<i>Little advice from someone who's
been in this business a long, long time?</i>

On the next one, maybe
try writing about what you know.

<i>Okay, kiddo?</i>

Yeah.

Start sharpening those pencils.

Yeah, yeah.

[phone disconnects]

[busy tone]

I think let's give it a minute
and see what happens next week.

Hey, I need a job.

Can you hold on a second?
I'll apologize to the focus group lady.

I will never say anything bad
about marketing research ever again,

I swear to God.

I'm gonna call you right back.

I wanna do what you do.
I wanna have what you have.

I want the BMW, I want the doorman,
I want it, I want all of it. Okay?

What's going on?
Oh, it's good. It's good.

I just spent
the last eight years killing myself

on a musical that's never gonna happen.

I find that very hard to believe.
It was incredible this morning.

Wellâ€¦But not incredible enough.

I can't do it again, Mike.

I can't stomach five more years
of waiting tables,

five more years of writing things
that no one will ever see

while Broadway just churns out
mega-musicals

without a hint of even
the slightest thing original

or, God forbid, something
to actually say about the world!

Are you done?

No, actually...
The presentation, Jon, it was amazing.

It would be a tragedy
to give up what you have.

You did it.
Please! [laughs]

I was a mediocre actor.

Do you know how many mediocre actors
there are in New York City?

Do you know how many
Jonathan Larsons there are?

One.

I can't keep wasting my time, Mike.

I turn 30 in two days.
And?

And Stephen Sondheim was 27
when he had his first show on Broadway.

Well, guess what? You're not
Stephen Sondheim. Wait a little longer...

I'm not waiting anymore.
I can't keep waiting. This is my life.

I understand.
No, you don't. I'm running out of time.

You are not running out of time.
You don't know anything about it.

I'm HIV-positive.

What?

How long have you known?
A few days.

Who knows?

I might get lucky. People do.

Live a year, longer even.

Anyway, I think I might know
a thing or two about running out of time.

Why didn't you tell me sooner?

You tried.

[phone rings]
[woman] <i>Jill Kramer returning, line two.</i>

I have to take that.

Mike...
I can't talk about this now, please.

Jill. Hey, it's Michael.

Yeah, I just want to see how
the Downy account was going.

[ticking starts]
Mm-hm.

[elevator dings]
[indistinct chatter]


[ticking continues]

<i>at sleep-away camp, 22 years ago.</i>

<i>We were eight.</i>

<i>I think of high school,
all the shows we did together.</i>

[elevator dings]

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>

I think of the summer that
our parents decided to stay

in the same town in Cape Cod,
a mile away from each other.

And we'd meet on the beach
every night and, umâ€¦

<i>We'd just sit there talking
till three in the morning about our plans.</i>

gonna move to the city together andâ€¦


â€¦find a cheap apartment and be discovered,

and change the world.

[woman on recording]
<i>Hey, you've reached Susan, Beth...</i>

[phone clatters]

<i>back from college.</i>

We smoked a bowl on Kennedy breakwater
and Michael told me he was gay.

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>


I think of their funerals.
[sobbing]

<i>not even 50,</i>

<i>saying the Kaddish over their children.</i>

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>

<i>and I think of Michael.</i>

<i>And before I understand
what's happening, I start running.</i>

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>

Past the pond, past the carousel.

[ticking intensifies]

<i>â™ª Is this real life? â™ª</i>

<i>I can't hear anything.</i>

<i>â™ª Is this real?
Is this real? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is this real? â™ª</i>

My heartbeat is pounding in my throat.

<i>The wind is shrieking through the trees.</i>

<i>The sky is darkening.</i>

I want it to stop.

<i>â™ª When I was nine â™ª</i>

There's, umâ€¦ there's a support group,
it's called Friends In Deed.

I just called them.
They have a meeting tomorrow morning.

You look like shit.
[laughs]

I'm so cold.

[both chuckle]

Come on.

Oh, Mike.

[both crying]
I'm sorry.

Sunday.

My 30th birthday.

[phone rings]

[phone continues to ring]

[Jon on machine] <i>â™ª Speak â™ª</i>
[beeps]

<i>Jon? Steve Sondheim here.</i>

<i>Rosa gave me this number,
I hope it's okay to call you.</i>

<i>I didn't get a chance to speak with you
after the reading,</i>

<i>but I just wanted to say
it was really good.</i>

<i>Congratulations.</i>

<i>I'd love to get together and talk to
you about it, if you have any interest.</i>

<i>- No pressure.</i>
[chuckles]

<i>The main thing though, is that
it's first-rate work and has a future.</i>

<i>And so do you.</i>

<i>I'll call you later with some thoughts,
if that's okay.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, be proud.</i>


You know, there was a small...
Very, very small piece of me

that was the teensiest bit happy
to hear you're not leaving.

I'd have been sad not
to see you every Sunday morning.

Oh. Cheers.

I told Freddy.
He's pissed off at your agent.

[both chuckle]
How is he?

He should be going home soon.
Really?

Yes. Yes. [laughing]

[glasses clink]
[whispers] Godâ€¦

Oh.

Uh, I'll be... Yeah.
You go handle that.

[entry bell chimes]

Hi.
Hi.

I didn't know you were, umâ€¦

I wasn't sure whether
you would want me here.

[chuckles lightly]

I'm so happy you're here.

So how was the reading? Did anybody...?

I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.

I really wanted to be there. I just...
Susanâ€¦

I know.

What are you gonna do now?

I'm gonna start the next one.

I decided to take the job.


I'm happy for you.

Happy birthday.

Thank you.

You really didn't have to get me anything.

It's for the next one.

Got any ideas?

Just questions.

That seems like
a really good place to start.

Goodbye, Jonathan.


<i>After that, he went back to a project</i>
<i>he'd started and put away, called</i> Rent.

<i>It ran on Broadway for 12 years.</i>

<i>It changed the definition
of what a musical could be.</i>

<i>What it could sound like.</i>

<i>The kinds of stories it could tell.</i>

<i>Jonathan never got to see it.</i>

<i>The night before</i> Rent's
<i>first public performance, he died</i>â€¦

<i>From a sudden aortic aneurysm.</i>

<i>He was 35 years old.</i>

<i>He still had so many questions.</i>

[piano melody playing]

<i>â™ª Why do we play with fire? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why do we run our finger
Through the flame? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why do we leave
Our hand on the stove â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Although we know
We're in for some pain? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, why do we refuse
To hang a light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When the streets are dangerous? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why does it take an accident â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Before the truth gets through to us? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cages or wings
Which do you prefer? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ask the birds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fear or love, baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't say the answer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Actions speak louder than words â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why should we try to be our best â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When we can just get by
And still gain? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why do we nod our heads â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Although we know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The boss is wrong as rain? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why should we blaze a trail â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When the well-worn path
Seems safe and â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So inviting? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How, as we travel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can we see the dismay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And keep from fighting? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cages or wings â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Cages or wings â™ª
â™ª Which do you prefer? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ask the birds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fear or love, baby
Don't say the answer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Actions speak louder than words â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Louder than, louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What does it take
To wake up a generation? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How can you make someone
Take off and fly? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If we don't wake up
And shake up the nation â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll eat the dust
Of the world wondering why â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Why? â™ª
â™ª Why? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why do we stay with lovers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who we know, down deep â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just aren't right? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whyâ€¦ â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Would we rather â™ª
â™ª Put ourselves through hell â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Than sleep alone at night? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why do we follow leaders
Who never lead? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why does it take catastrophe
To start a revolution? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If we're so free, tell me why â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Someone tell me why
So many people bleed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cages or wings â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Cages or wings â™ª
â™ª Which do you prefer? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ask the birds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fear or love, baby
Don't say the answer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Actions speak louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Louder than, louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Louder than, louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cages or wings â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Which do you prefer? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ask the birds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fear or love, baby
Don't say the answer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Actions speak louder â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Louder than, louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They speak louder â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Louder than, louder than â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Actions speak louder than â™ª</i>

["Come To Your Senses"
performed by Jazmine Sullivan]

<i>â™ª You're on the air â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm underground â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Signal's fading â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't be found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I finally open up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For you I would do anything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But you've turned off the volume â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just when I've begun to sing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Defenses are not the way to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you know
Or at least you knew â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's strange, you've changed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I don't know what to do
To get through â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know what to do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I have to laugh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You sure put on a show â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Love is passÃ© in this day and age â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How can we expect it to grow? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You as the knight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Me as the queen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I've got tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is static on a screen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The fences inside are not for real â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If we feel as we did, and I do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't you recall when this all began â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was only you and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It was only me and you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But now the air is
Filled with confusion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We replace care with illusion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How come it's cool to be cold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When nothing lasts anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When love becomes disposable â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This is the shape of things
We cannot ignore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses
Suspense is fine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you're just an empty image â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Emanating out of a screen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, be real, you can feel again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You don't need a music box melody â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To know what I mean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Will you come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, come to your senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come to your senses â™ª</i>

["Only Takes a Few"
performed by The Mountain Goats]

<i>â™ª "Almost missed this one," he said
I stared at the honky-tonk piano â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sure beats living in town
The beach is a half a mile away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª "Not much of the cat," I said
He stared down underneath the couch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It doesn't matter much to me
Not gonna beat it anyway â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It only takes a few cents more
To go first class â™ª</i>

To go first class â™ª</i>
