<i>NEW YORK,
SEPTEMBER, 2003</i>

<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.</i>

<i>And I have a story,
I think you're gonna want to hear</i>

<i>BASED ON A TRUE STORY</i>

<i></i>

<i></i>

<i></i>

<i></i>

<i></i>

<i>UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK
OCTOBER, 2002</i>

Michael Sullivan?

How long have you been in as 
lobbyist for Banco Belasquian?

Two years.

A lot of strategy,
research and reports.

That's a good job. 

You're not happy there?

No, I'm just...

I don't want to wake up when I'm 40 and..

discovered the only thing I contributed to the world is,

tax shelters, sweatshops and
holes in the ozones.

You're an idealist?

For as long as I can remember, 
I wanted to be a diplomat.

I want to make a difference
in the world.

Your father was a diplomat.

Ah yeah. US state department.
He..

<i>Libanon, 1983.</i>

I'm sorry for your lost.

<i>My father passed away when I was little.</i>

<i>He was killed in the bombing of the US Embassy
in Beirut when I was 5 years old.</i>

<i>One of my earliest memory is my father...</i>

<i>telling stories about the founding
of the United Nations.</i>

We find a way to end wars.

<i>He made it sound like modern day knights 
sitting around the round table.</i>

<i>I wanted to follow him in his foot steps.</i>

<i>By the fall of 2002,</i>

<i>I have applied for a job at the United Nations
four times.</i>

<i>My sister said it's because
foreign services is in our family legacies.</i>

 Hey little brother, how are you?
 Hello. Good.

 Sorry. I'm late.
 You look good.

<i>And just like my mother,</i>

<i>She married a guy
she met while interning in the UN.</i>

So I got you something small
but something else is on its way, ok?

 Hey, Trevor.
 Hey.

Nice cake, Lily.

Got enough Danish Flags?
Yeah.. yeah.

Well..Did you hear anything?

Ah..No.

I'll hear tomorrow.

But how did it feel?

Good?

 No. 

I was too nervous

Oh well. It's their lost.

I'm sure you'll get it.

You've been working so hard for this.
Yeah.

Somebody's birthday,
So shall we do cake?

Yes!

<i>Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday, Dear Kate</i>

These candidates keep getting harder than 
getting hedge funds.

Michael Sullivan.

62 
I knew his father.

Danish passport.

His mother side.

But he's only 24 years old.

He'll do.

<i>I thought I would start with some entry level assignment.</i>

<i>Instead I got a dream job.</i>

<i>Special assistant to the Under-Secretary-General.</i>

<i>Running the largest humanitarian program
in United Nation's history.</i>

<i>I couldn't believe my luck.</i>

<i>All I could thinking was don't fuck this up.</i>

The program is called
"Oil for Food".

It was created in 1995.

By Security Council resolution 986
which is stated that

the UN will manage the sale of Iraqui oil

And he used the profits to provide humanitarian relief
 in the country to allieviate the hardship

which basically means that...

Our office is in charge of trying to feed the entire nation.

Over 20 million people.

You have a little reading to catch up on.

We are wholefully behind schedule now 
funding data reports to the security council.

Your immediate task would be to help facilitate its
completion.

Your predecessor was due to brief Under-Secretary
tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

What happened to him?

The car accident in Iraq.

Jesus Christ!

Is he all right?

No, he didn't make it.

A bullet point summary will do.

Pasha will be in his office at night.

Got a couple of minutes, Michael?

Justin Cutter, Central Intelligence.

Really?

Yeah, we come in all shapes and sizes.

Ok. Can I help you with something?

Listen. We think "Oil for Food" is being gained...

for private gain
by a bad guy or by a bad guy's unknown.

Possibly withheld from the inside
which is where you are.

I just got this job.

I'm not gonna,,
I'm not gonna spoil it through.

Oh God no.

Leave that to the professionals.

I don't want you to do anything
that makes you uncomfortable, Michael.

Just keep your eyes and ears open.
That's all.

For God and Country.

<i>I was aware going in "Oil for Food" program
</i>

<i>becomes a something of a "political football".</i>

<i>The program budget was 10 billon dollars a year.</i>

<i>The entire rest of the UN operation budget was only two.</i>

<i>It was crazy money to be had.</i>

<i>Special interests circling like buzzard.</i>

<i>The program was simple.</i>

<i>Because of the economic sanction post against
 Saddam Hussein</i>

<i>after the first Gulf War,</i>

<i>Iraqui ecomony hit crushed.</i>

<i>People were starving and dying 
from the lack of basis medicines and staples.</i>

<i>The "Oil for Food" program was designed to
provide</i>

<i>Iraqui citizens with what they needed to survive.</i>

<i>While at the same time preventing
 Saddam from developing</i>

<i>his alleged Weapons of mass destruction.</i>

<i>Under UN supervision ,
Iraqui oil were being sold at market prices</i>

<i>to pay for humanitarian aid.</i>

<i>Our job was to keep it funded</i>

<i>by making sure everything went by the book.</i>

I'm here to present the summary.

He'll be with you in a minute.

This fucking regime!

Unbelievable. Yes.

I solved it and dissolved it as a solution.

No, we charges the load of taxes
that should last to outline villages.

They don't get the trust back.

You called this a "summary"?

Fucking "War and Peace"

Sorry sir.
I was trying to be thorough.

Thorough?

Yes. Sir.

Fuck.

Well, just give me the highlights kid.
Otherwise, we'll be here till spring thaw.

Yes. We have to decrease the malnutrition rate.
Reduce child mortality.

We've also made bid strike in access to water and electricity.

There are however some..systemic distribution failures. 
Particularly in the North.


The Kurds are getting shortage.
Wheat, Milk, diesel fuel

to the benefit of Tikrit
who are getting seemingly more than their fair share.

Saddam's hometown. What a surprise.

Yeah.

There are also all these after service fees
in the contracts.

I'm pretty sure they kickbacks.

If you want to take a look,

I'm highlighted and aggregated among 
page 26 to 29.

It's a lot of money, Sir.

In some places, it is much as 30%.

Sit.

Kid.

Sit down.

The first rule of Diplomacy is that
the truth is not the matter of fact.

It's a matter of consensus.

The consensus right now is
the sanctions are here to stay.

160 
The Americans and the British will never lift them.

which means...

that if you want the people of Iraq to survive,

We have to keep "Oil for Food" running.

Even with all these wars and flaws.

Sir. You don't...
The second rule is to keep your mouth shut and listen,

and then if it suits you, you can talk.

With discretion.

Otherwise, keep your cards towards your vest.

Yeah.

Your father was a good man.

You sure be so lucky as to have his heart.

Yes. I've been told.

We crossed paths a couple of times.

Must have been 79, 80.

What a tragedy.

Beirut.

Fuck.

I'm sorry.

It must have been hard a boy growing up
without a father.

It was my normal.

I had my cry.

Good.

Fix your summary.

Go home and pack.

We leave for Baghdad
on a red light.

What? You have other plans?

No. I don't. 

Of course not. Thank you.

<i>BAGHDAD, IRAQ</i>

<i>I was swapped up in the role I summoned.</i>

<i>I mean this is what I wanted.</i>

<i>High adventure and the worthy cause.</i>

<i>It's like Baghdad was my "Casablanca".</i>

<i>More or less sketchy, crazy, dangerous and
stranger than I could ever imagine.</i>

<i>The country live in the state of 
permanant South occupation.</i>

Our Baghdad's office is
going to present a problem.

Ok.

The contracted director sarbotaged the reports.

Why? Why would he sarbotage his own report?

She.

So the Security Council will be forced to lift a sanction,

and everybody can cash in on the deals they made
with Saddam...

back before he rouge into Kuwait
and pissed off the world.

Jesus H Christ, kid.

I'm gonna have to fucking teach you in everything from scratch.

Every six months, we have to justify our
continued existence.

Our job right now is to write report
for the Security Council.

Emphasizing for the good in
"Oil for Food" program

whilst minimzing the challenges.

Not to lie.

No. Never lie.

But to chose

our facts or truths with the utmost care

Right.

Can I trust you to do that?

Yes. Absolutely.

There she is. Madame Dupre.

Trying to backstab us.

Christina.

Hassan Ghazarian.
Michael Sullivan.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Photo?
Oui.

Did you get the documents I sent you?
I did.

I even printed them out for you.
Oh Great.

It went well.

Sixty percent of the Iraqui people

are solely depended upon our supplies for survival.

Wheat, grain, milk, medicines.
Essential infrastructures.

During the last of ten months,

we have decrease malnutrition rate amongst children
in Iraq by fifty percent.

Thereby reduce child mortality
significantly.

Ok. Thank you very much.

Photographers coming through.
We gonna have a photo opportunity

with Madame Dupre.

<i>It's hard to overstate how badly Saddam was 
abusing his people.</i>

<i>Friends of the rÃ©gime
gets easy access to the medicines.</i>

<i>Others, less fortunate,</i>

<i>were left to die for even the simplest of diseases.
Wait.</i>

They sent back drugs.

 Out of the prescriptions.

Thank him for bringing this to me.
Tell him I'll definitely looking into it.

He said there's a black market 
with "Oil for Food" appears.

Oh this innocent child.

Please explain to her why she cannot have the stem cell
therapy that could cure her.

Why she has to suffer because the West begrudges 

Iraq its dignity.

That I can't explain. No.

She asked why you are crying.

I promise I will do anything I can to help your child.

It sickens me to have to stand there and 
listen to your lies.

It's PR, Christina.
Everyone in the field is working so hard.

Well, my report to the Security Council is
going to tell the truth.

Just so you know.

Your report.

The program is a failure.

The sanctions are not working.
How is the program failing?

Medicines getting through.
At what cost?

People are getting basis staples..
At what cost?

Everybody is grifting the system.

Corruption grows like a cancer.
It will never be perfect.

And surely it's better than doing nothing.

Michael, what's the delay?

Ah sorry, It's just.. the security issues.
We'll be on our way in a few moments.

I know what you are doing.

You want me to sign off on your moral relativism.

So you can throw me under the bus when it's all unravel.

You are mistaken.

I just trying to feed a Country.
Enough spins, Costa. Enough.

The facts will speak for themselves.

My report to the Security Council is going to tell the truth.

<i>HOTEL AL RASHEED BAGHDAD, IRAQ.</i>

Baghdad is the center of the Universe, kid.

And this Al Rasheed is ground zero.

Boiler room of Diplomacy.

Pasha! Nice to see you again.

Mr. Mohammed, my assistant.

Michael Sullivan.

Cut your fingers off if you
shake hands with this one.

All major intelligence agencies are here.

All rooms above.

281 
Everyone try to bother in its secrets and services.

Information is everything.

The currency, the power.

Look. Listen. Learn.

Everyone has their own agenda,
huh?

May be Bush thinks Saddam
disrespected his papa.

American convinced democracy will bloom like 
a fucking flower.

Good luck with that.

Putin wants Bush to fail.
China wants a new market.

Half of Europe couldn't care less about the Saddam.
Civillians are built of bombs, big oil.

Simply want to end of the sanctions

so he can suck an Iraqui dick ...

So by the way, a doctor told me today.

The bits of medicines missing supplies.

I smell a setup. 

It didn't really feel like a setup.
No. 

Nonsense.
She's not just an effective.

She's actively prooving the program's failing.

If we don't do something, this report
gonna be a disaster.

Don't you get the final say?

Sadly, no.

UN protocols require regional director 
signed off on the report.

What's our agenda?

Our agenda? That little girl

at the hospital.

God help anyone who gets in our way.

Yeah.

I have a son once.

Died from a flu. Just a baby.

Can you believe that?

And my wife..

312 
we couldn't make another.

Sorry.

30 years ago.

How did you put it?

I have my cry.

Flu.

You tired?

No.

Youth. Fuck.

You know for someone who speaks for the people
for a living

you don't talk much.

I couldn't help...

but notice you were not surprise when the doctor

spoke of black market medicines.

No, I wasn't.

Will you tell your boss?

Yeah. We already know and 
is approaching the program.

Outside Baghdad is much worse.

Rations diverted, power cut off.

Extortion, Bribes..

Well. I'll make sure Pasha knows that too.

You have something you want to ask me?

It's about Madame?

That your boss wants you to find the secret button

he can push and bend her his way?

I can tell you.

It does not exist.

I'm just trying to do my job.

But...

your predecesor, Abhek.

His car accident was not an accident.

That's a pretty big accusation you made.

Why are you telling me this?

He was murdered because of something he uncovered.

Something in "Oil for Food"?

I don't know. May be.

He was feared for that someone 
inside United Nations.

A facilitator of corruption.

You need to be very very careful.

Good evening.

Please.

Mukhabarat you see
was concerned..

to inspect your sleeping chamber
for the existence of any survillance device.

This as a courtesy for your security of course.

Why don't you start by telling me who you are?

Are you enjoying your visit to Mesopotamia, Mr.Sullivan?

First one if I'm not mistaken, yes?

Such a difficult stressful time for everyone here.

The great satan keeps threatening to bomb the city

meanwhile the sanctions cut deep.

Baghdad ..
Why don't you get to the point!

You will find on the bureau behind me
an envelope containing a small fee.
 
We greatly admired
the work you're doing for the Iraqui.

It's late. I'd like you to leave.
Please.

No disrespect was meant by it.

Don't forget your envelope.

Can't blame them for trying.
It's nothing.

You handled it perfectly.

Yeah.

What about what the interpreter said about Abhek?

I don't believe it.

Perhaps she's a spy for Saddam
sent to rattle us.

You look like shit, kid. Fuck.

Eat something.

I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

<i>I've been warned.</i>

<i>But I was still shocked by the criticisims from </i>

<i>UN staffs against the sanction</i>

<i>Pasha was right.</i>

<i>Every department had an agenda.</i>

<i>They were working across purposes</i>

<i>and played right into Madame Dupre's hands.</i>

Shut up!

You sound like Saddam's puppets.
All of you.

Do I need to point out the serious fucking consequences
to Iraqui people 

if we fail to..
Sir, your violations..

Are you fucking kidding me!

It's not our place to question the decisions 
of the Security Council.

We implement them.

Absent of all politics.

And yes, it's our fucking job sometimes.

But if you can't do it,

I suggest you turn in your fucking credentials
and go home.

<i>I knew from my research that</i>

<i>our biggest worry was Kurdistan.</i>

<i>KURDISTAN REGION, NORTHERN IRAQ</i>

<i>As long as Saddam was in power,</i>

<i>It was gonna take all of Pasha's 
considerable diplomatic skills</i>

<i>to keep the Kurds from undermining the report.</i>

The rations, when they come,
I always have half of what was promised.

The North is a protector,
so unfortunately...

<i>They even hit harder on the sanctions
than any other regions.</i>

<i>while "Oil for Food" was
providing some relief.</i>

<i>It had helped sustain the very regime that suppress them.
</i>

The Kurds have pits of money to buy their own food.
 
From that black market oil!

Mister, if you'd allow me,

<i>The Kurdish conflict with Iraq
goes back nearly a century.</i>

<i>Saddam Hussein took it to a whole new level.</i>

<i>Force displacement,
mass detention and torture.</i>

<i>And then when that didn't work,
resort it to land mines and cluster bombs.</i>

<i>Sarin gas and nerve agents,</i>

<i>killing ten of thousands and crippling 
ten of thousands more.</i>

<i>A reign of terror.</i>

<i>that included the worst single act of
chemical genocide ever committed against the civillian population.</i>

Kurds are dying for simply being Kurdish.

<i>And in a shuttle diplomacy between two sworn enemies,</i>

<i>I watched Pasha worked his magic.</i>

It's how the most beloved food Allah

is that which is touched by many hands.

Fuck. This is all I need.

Kurdish minister is right.

And from what I've been told, 
they're getting completely screwed..

I know he's right.
It's in the fucking field reports.

But we have to keep a little bit.
 
The choice can't be to feed everyone or feed no one.

429 
It has to be feeded to many as possible.

I have to go back to New York tomorrow.

I need you to stay focus.

Of course.

Here's your travel rights.

You are connected to Kuwait, lands in JFK
at 5 pm.

Dupre is going to freeze you out of the final report.

Her oppose is inditement for
"Oil for Food".

Ok then why am I staying here then?

In a few days, you'll receive some photographs.

You want Hassan to see them
because you won't understand what they could mean.

Your task is to make sure he shows them to Dupre
by insisting he shouldn't.

You asking me if I...

a trap. Yes.

She'll fall into it,
and we'll be rid of her.

Kid. 

It's diplomacy.

Sometimes require removing obstacles

that standing in the way of successful outcomes.

Can I trust you again with this one?

I mean what lie am I gonna be telling?

Not lie.

Just the opportunity to draw around conclusion.

Morning.

Just so you know,

Madame said you won't be reading reports
until it's finished and she signed off on it.

I'll be by if she wants me to help.

People in hell want ice water.

We just ponds in the bigger game you and me.

Sorry, Michael.

Hassan.

At least she can help me arrange an interpreter
for the field trip.

I want to open one of the boxes and 
check the expiration date.

He said he's the company representative.

Tell him I want to open one of these boxes.

These pills expired in 1999.

Sick people will get sicker or die because of these.

Every box needs to be checked.

And the out of date medicines 
need to be destroyed.

And the Manufacture will have to replace it
at their own expense.

I should warn you.

Everyone here thinks I'm your prostitute.

All right. we should split
the check up.

You can't really just ask for a date 
without chaperone for women in Iraq.

There are rituals and traditions.

Do you want to call it off then?

Did you tell your boss what I said about Ahbek?

Yeah, I did.

He thinks you might be a government spy.

So are you? The spy?

Is that a serious question?

It's a pretty evasive answer.

No.

Now it's my turn to ask you.

Ok.

What are you doing here?

Well, I'm doing a status report for the
"Oil for Food" program and I'm gonna..

I mean today with the spoiled medicines.

What you did had nothing to do with writing a report.

You took action.

It was risky and rather brave.

Was that just to impress me?

I'm not here just to be a functionary.

I took this job for a reason.

Because I want to help people.

And I want to make a difference.

Make a difference?

Exactly.

I will drink to that.

Cheers.

They're not gonna bomb Baghdad.

Without getting the UN staffs out...

Mr. Sullivan?
Yeah?

This has come for you.
Thanks.

Ah... I've gotta go.

It was on my desk, sir.

Are those "Oil for Food" trucks?

Yeah. But I don't want to source them.

If they're real, they are proof that we are being gamed
by Saddam Hussein.

Yeah. "If". 
I still don't think we should trust them.

Using our trucks to deliver weapons?
I mean what the fuck?

I just gonna packed them up
into carrier pouch..

and see what Pasha thinks.
No, no.

Let me show Christina first.
No.

No.. No chance.

It's ok. What do you call it?

Chain of command.

Ok.

Hi.

Hey.

I need to show you something.

Ok.

They are friends.

Ok.

<i>KURDISTAN REGION, NORTHERN IRAQ</i>

So this place isn't here officially.

These are the graves of Kurdish civillians that
Saddam Hussein suddenly decided they no longer needed to live.

Gas, sarÃ­n, TabÃºn, Vx.

The smell of sweet apples..

He doesn't care about your
sanctions or resolutions.

He's the angel of death.

Azrael.

You're Kurdish?

My parents were intellectuals.

Activists in UK.

Killed in Halabdja.

I'm sorry.

Nobody in Baghdad
knows I'm Kurdish, Michael.

If Saddam spies find out,

they will disappear me.

My friends they have Ahbek
uncovered on criminal conspiracies.

Saddam is using to scheme billions of dollars from
 "Oil for Food".

Ahbek claimed there's a whole system of corruption..

that reaches to the highest levels of
the same invested Government that

support sanctions.

Ok. How did Ahbek know this?

There's a rumor. Office list.

A list that contains names of people,
and organisations.. 

all over the world who
are all getting paid off by Saddam...

to keep the system running.

And Ahbek had seen it.

Did you bring it?
Yes.

They have had it on its computer.
You sure nobody saw you?

The office has emptied.
Everyone has gone home.

Ahbek, what's going on with you?

I'm going North.

Across the border.

It's not safe for me here.

He made a back up.

But it's encrypted.

We don't have the sources to decypher it.

Why didn't you take it to someone more senior
in the UN?

I mean. Anyone? Madame Dupre.

Nobody would listen to her.

It's important who delivered the list.

No one can accuse you of being
partisan of...

having an agenda about the truth.

I'm not gonna hand this, Nashim.

I'm not gonna do that.

No. I don't want that.

I just want you to take it back with you.

And find someone who can break the encryption.

And then together we can decide what to do.

Shit!

It's Mukhabarat.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Jesus.

There must be a mistake.
I'm..an UN official.

The young diplomat.

You know it's very dangerous for you
to be in this God forsaken desert unescorted.

Mukhabarat was concerned 
you might have been kidnapped by these individuals.

Consider this a courtesy.

Your paper.

I'll tell you this with all humility, Mr. Sullivan.

Cos I'm sure it won't happen again.

Your recent visit to the pharmaceutical
distribution service...

that was unnecessarily provocative. Yes?

It would be in everyone's best interest
in the future

where you decide such inspections
were no longer necessary.

They're armed!

She is my interpreter. Right! I told you!

Stop!

Go. Now.
Before they change their minds.

Get in the car.

He kept my papers.

It's only a question of time now
before they find out who I am.

Where is the girl?

What girl?
The Kurdish girl.

I don't know what you are talking about.
You are lying!

I don't know what you are talking about.
Don't lie.

I don't know where she is.
I saw you with her.

Yeah. I know. 
But I don't know where she is. Ok?

Let me just.. Let me make a call.

I don't know where she is.

Get out!

You have no jurisdiction here. Out!

It's Michael Sullivan from Baghdad 
of "Oil for Food" office.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I need to arrange an UNLP
for one of our staffs here.

Yeah.. The name is Nashim.

Huesseni.

Hey.

I took all I could carry.

This will get you to the US.

The High Commission for Refugees 
will help you get a VISA.

I don't know. I can go to
Kurdish part of Turkey. I have some friends there.

No. You'll be safer in New York.

We'll get you to the US.
And then we de-encrypt the list together.

Go. You cannot be seen with me.

Whatever happens..

Just promise me you'll let me know.

Whatever happens...

happens.

Right?

Thank you.

Thank you.

Would you please come to my office
immediately?

You really expect me to fall for these?

These.. I don't even know what to call them.

Garbage!

What was the plan?
Shook me to releasing them?

And then force me out when the evidence
comes this is false?

I'm at loss.
I don't even know what you are talking about.

Madame.

I've sent some documents.

Hassam wants to show them to you
that's it.

You are finished in the UN.
Do you hear me?

Your career is over!

What will you have him do?
He got some photos!

Shame on you.

Shame on both of you!

The report is finished.

It tells the truth about the failure of
"Oil for Food".

The files are in digital.

watermarked, timed, date.

And I have secure copies.

So you can't change anything
when it goes to New York.

The battle is over, Costa.
And you have lost.

Security Council will make the decision
based on the facts.

She's gone. Pasha.

Well. Fuck.

Nothing more for you to do there, kid.

Take the next UN flight. Come home.

Don't worry about it.

<i>JFK AIRPORT,
NEW YORK</i>

Excuse me, Sir.

Let me see your passport?

Oh yeah.. Sure.

Mr. Sullivan?
I need you to come with us.

Michael, how are you doing?

I have nothing for you.

No, that's ok.
I got something for you.

Christina Dupre is dead.

They found her few hours ago alone at home.

Heart attack.

At least. That's what they're saying.

What do you mean 
"that's what they're saying."?

What did you think happen, Mike?

I... I don't..

I have no idea.
Why would I?

Your boss.

What does he think?

You have questions for Pasha, 
you should just ask him yourself.

Did he ever mention anything about a list?

No. Why?

Michael.

Is there anything you want to tell me right now?

No.

Thanks.

Hello?
You are home.

Yeah.. Yeah..
I just got in.

Did you hear about Madame?

Yeah.

Terrible. Terrible.

We have our disagreements
but..

this has break my heart.

And the.. the report?

Hassan has shown me that he doesn't share 
the Madame's determination 

to block the program...

He will sign off as her successor

I want everything to get refunded.

Madame was wrong.
Being fucking dead doesn't change that.

You have two days to clean this up.

What do you mean I've got two days 
to clean this up?

I thinking I might need you to present
the oral summary.

Wait. Do you want me to present the report?

To the old fucking Security Council.

Isn't that break your protocol Pasha?

I can do what I like.

Besides they should be hearing from
somebody close to the ground 

than whom else can I toss to do it?

Ok. Yeah..

Are you kidding me?

This is such a big deal.

For somebody, your pay grade
stands before the Security Council?

Yeah. I know it's a great opportunity.

What?

Where do you get this?

A friend in Baghdad.

No. I mean I can't crack this.

Do you know anyone who can?

Do you even know what's on the drive?

No.

Do you know anyone who can crack it?

Yeah.. I'll give it a try.

Mind if I.. hold on to this?

Yeah. Keep it.

Yeah, I was given this was a possible 
contact number for her.

Yeah. Exactly. Michael Sullivan.

No. I understand, yeah.

Just.. the number I gave you.
If you could make sure,

you or one of your colleagues
gets back to me if you hear anything at all.

<i>Madame Dupre's death hang over
"Oil for Food" program like a cloud.</i>

<i>But Pasha had a clear path for what he wanted.</i>

I focus on writing the report.

<i>I didn't want anyone to doubt that
I deserve to be in that room.</i>

<i>I couldn't help think about my father.</i>

<i>Whether he'd stood before the Council 
like I would.</i>

<i>Whether he would think of what he was doing
was right.</i>

You ok?

I'm ok now.

They are one hundred percent fucking 
certainty WMD is in Iraq,

and zero percent certainty where they are.

Let me call you back.

Finished.

Pending your review and Hassan signed off.

That's my boy.

Good work.

I got a call..

from Oversight.

About your UNLP request
for our sexy little tr anslator.

They ask me to look into it.

I believe she's in New York now.

Right.

She's Kurdish.

She needs an asylum.

They killed two of her countrymen.

Kurdish don't have a country.

She makes friends like you everywhere.

All the tricks in the book.

The honeypot.

CIA calls it a "the tangle" now.

Seduce them up.
Tell them fairy tales.

It's not just the russians, notice?

CIA.

MI5, Interpol.
 
Girl has a big following.

Pashmerga sent it to school in England.

Got a phoney paper and a job
in Baghdad, UN.

What is she want you to do?

Nothing.

I bet she's hiding skills in the soft art.

What you did is stupid and illegal.

I'll make it go away.

In future if you're gonna do these things,
you've got to come to me first.

Who gave you this?
It doesn't matter.

You've been using me.

No.
Yes.

You said you wanted to help.

Our meeting wasn't like that... I really..
Fucking bullshit, Nashim. I know how this works.

Do you?
Yeah.

Yes. Ok. 
I''m guilty of taking a job in Bagdad

and try to find a way to help 
my people.

Get free of a dictator who wants to
exterminate us.

And yes, I talked with men 
who might be off help.

But I didn't sleep with any of them, Ok?

I didn't have to.
Nashim.

You have asked me to risk my life
for the list..
 
that I don't even know where it fucking came from.

This is...

I'm sorry but..

This is who I am.

Do you want me to leave?

Hi!

Hey.

I came to wish you luck.

Hey, man.

Knock them dead.
Thank you.

Ready?
Yeah.

You'll do great. Relax.
Thanks.

<i>In an unusual move at today's
United Nations "Oil for Food" vote,</i>

<i>Under-Secretary-General Costa Passaris..</i>

<i>yielded his chair to his 
executive assistant Michael Sullivan</i>

<i>to present the report 
on the status of the program.</i>

The "Oil for Food' program continues to
achieve its core mission of providing humanitarian relief.

<i>The request for continue funding comes</i>

<i>in a wake of the sudden death of
Baghdad field director</i>

<i>Christina Dupre,
who is a vocal critic of the program.</i>

<i>And against the backdrop of
the intensifying efforts</i>

<i>to find Saddam Hussein suspected cashes and</i>

<i>weapons of mass destruction.</i>

Continuing resolution 986,
the Council has voted unanimously.

to extend funding for another 180 days.

<i>Michael Sullivan address the press
after the Security Council vote.</i>

I don't understand why you want here,
like me? Why?

I know.

Me neither. Let's get a drink, ok?

Here you are.

My prodigy. Michael Sullivan.

Timur Rasnetsov.

Costa insists you were the hero of
"Oil for Food".

And here is Nashim.

Lovely.

Welcome to the USA.

Thank you.

Where is your drink?

I think we even have some Arak
tuck away.

So how have you been?

Fine. Thank you.

Great.

Well, enjoy your evening.

You must be the young diplomat Michael Sullivan.

My husband is always talking about you.

Nice to meet you. Plesure.

I'm Melina, Pasha' wife.

Of course, Yes.

Pasha gushes about you. 
Pasha doesn't gush about anyone.

Yeah. He certainly told me a lot.

It can never work.

Is that the proud Papa
protecting his surrogate son?

Don't patronize me.

Is this so unthinkable that
I could be in love with him?

You are what you are.

You cannot fool me.

You gave him the file on me.

Listen.

If you do anything to compromise the kid
or hurt him,

I will have you deported so fast
your hijab would spin.

No.. I have to.. I have to go.

My apologies. I have to deal with something.

How long have you known that guy for?

He came with the delegation.
We just met. Why?

He was the one who tried to bribe me 
in my Hotel in Baghdad.

Paradics is very well connected.
Could be useful.

I've gotta go.

What the fuck was that man doing
at the party?

I don't know.

What did Pasha want?

He threatened me.

864 
Your boss threatened me.

Hello?

<i>Michael, my guy came through,
you better come see this.</i>

867 
You're not gonna believe this.

Saddam. He's been selling Oil vouchers.

At that discount, the people who turn around,
resell the vouchers with the going on pay grade.

For huge profits.

Saddam gets a kickback,
shares the difference between his discounts on a going rate.

How much does he make?

Could be over a billion dollars.

Jesus Christ!

We know if these are real?

They look real.

And it looks like a system.

There's a list of all the major players,

Politcians, Businessmen, Bankers.

We're talking highly placed people..

at the very heart of most first world goverments.

They are taking millions of dollars
and bribes.

This is real. Of course, it's real.

Well. To proove it, you gonna need records
of the actual transactions.

You need to get this to Pasha.

This is an UN internal matter.

You do not want to be left holding the bag on this.

Amongst the encrypted documents, 
I found this video codec.

How long does it run for?

71 minutes.
71 minutes is a strange time.

I sort of scroll through a bit, 
it's pretty much the same.

Zoom in.

Go back.

I knew it.

I fucking knew it. I knew..

I knew that he was involved.

We need to make the list public.

We can't do that.

They'll just deny it.

Then all it'll do is destroy the UN.

We need to find someone 
to start asking questions.

"Media, The Congress",
the truth will come out.

All these powerful interests in play,
they will decide what the truth is.

Pasha will be the sacrificial lamb 
and my career will be over.

You are not part of this.

Of course, I'm fucking part of this.

<i>I just gave a speech about the integrity
for "Oil for Food".</i>

What are you saying? Do nothing?
I don't know what I'm saying.

What's going on?

Michael! Somebody!

Man, you ok?
You need me to call 911?

Where is she?
I don't know.

Call your friend. Tell him
I will trade what he wants for Nashim.

He's not my friend.

Pasha, I have a video of you taking 
a fucking bribe from him.

You gonna come inside, kid or 
do we have to do this out here?

We gonna do this out here.

I take a cut. Sure.

Why not? Everyone else has.

I put my whole career on the line
for this mission every fucking day.

Come inside, kid. It's cold.

Rasnetsov is a fixer.

He's a very dangerous man.

Nothing in Iraq runs. Nothing without him.

And who wants him?

The highest bidder.

Moscow, Beijing, Saddam, 
hedge funds, mafia, Greek.

Rasnetsov is a bridge between
politics and reality.

And whose sides are you on, Pasha?

I thought I heard you coming.

Sit down Michael. Please.

I'll make the call.

Coffee?

Yeah, thanks.

Did you enjoy the party last night?

Yeah, we had a great time. Thank you.

You left so early. I wondered.

My friend.. She wasn't feeling too well.

It's a flu season.

Yeah.

Well, I'll leave you to it.

They handed her over to Immigration.

Ok. Was she has papers?

I think they find them missing.

She becomes an irritation.

If she gets deported to Iraq,
they will execute her for treason.

I'll send her back to Baghdad,
I still have some sway.

No, you call him back and tell him, 
I'm not gonna give up the list until Nashim sets free.

That's not how it works.

You need to trust me.
I did trust you Pasha. 

I trusted you and you fucked me 
in every turn.

Look where we are.

Committing crimes and taking bribes.

The crime would have been to do nothing

to watch innocence suffer and die.

What about Dupre, and what about Ahbek?
What was the justification for that?

We didn't make the storm.

We can't control the strom.

All we can do is plot our course,
set out sails and try to do our best.

As we did and we do.

Best for whom? Pasha.
Best for you?

Not best for Nashim. Not best for her people.

Look. May be you love the spy.
Fuck.

Who am I to argue with a heart?

Don't let her get you killed.

We can help her people.
But we have to do it our way.

Bush's coalition of the willing
is going to invade Iraq 

in a matter of days now.
Consensus is changing.

If it's truth, Saddam is history.

And "Oil for Food" can be 
successful framework

for rebuilding of a new free Iraq

in which the United Nations,
not the carpet buggers and craven carvens 

who created this nightmare.
The UN can take the lead fucking role.

You and me, kid.

We can save the world.

And save your girl.

Trust me.

My fellow citizens.

At this hour, 
America and college enforces are

in early stages of military operations

to disarm Iraq,
to free his people.

And to defend the world from grave danger.

<i>Over the next 24 to 48 hours,</i>

<i>perhaps as many as three thousand..
three thousand missiles</i>

<i>Satellite guided precision bombs,
laser guided bombs</i>

<i>would be dropped at various targets,
not only in Bagdad or around Bagdad,</i>

<i>but elsewhere around the..</i>

<i>Since we started the invasion,
I was back in Baghdad.</i>

<i>To work on Pasha's plan 
to put UN in charge of</i>

<i>rebuilding the new Iraq.</i>

<i>The sanctions were lifted.</i>

<i>The free market would power 
the country.</i>

<i>Free elections would give every citizen of voice.</i>

<i>And oil would pay the bills.</i>

<i>Pasha still have strong connections.</i>

<i>And he kept his promise to me.</i>

Nashim Husseini!

The days burned together.

Blank pages.

I've missed you.

I have something for you.

A new passport and a VISA so

You can stay as long if you want.

And what about the list?

I gave it to Pasha.

You traded this? For me?
Yeah.

Why?
I didn't exactly have a choice.

I made a judgement call. Ok?

And what you think is going to happen 
to Pasha now?

Pasha can still do a lot of good in the UN.

You are dreaming.
I'm not dreaming.

I'm not dreaming. I'm not. Ok.
Consensus has changed.

With Saddam gone, 
we can actually do a lot of good..

Just by thinking you can work with the criminals
to take what you want. You're at lost.

It wasn't exactly a fight 
we are going to win, was it?

I put all my fucking life on this.

Who are you to decide that for me?

You said it yourself.

It's very very fucking complicated.

No. Not this part.

This part is very simple.

I don't want to be a part of this.
 No, no.

I can't.

Nashim. Wait... Wait. Wait!!

Nashim!

I'm told you aren't answering your phone.
What the fuck.

Yeah. I've been busy.
Yah.

I heard.

Your Kurdish took a walk.

Relationships are trainwreck.

Come on, Kid.

You wanted a career in diplomacy.

Well, you're missing a golden moment.

See you at the office.

Pasha. Are those medical contracts...

I was on my way out.

Pasha.

See you.

It's good to see you again, Michael.

You think I like it?

He got the world in his pocket, kid.

All the major fucking players in
reconstruction.

I don't understand. When did he get back into this?

He never left. He just moved into the shadows
when the stakes got higher.

There was no one else.

We've been through this, Michael.

I'm not gonna fucking deal with him.

What?

This is how it works.

<i>The optimisim of the liberation was
short-lived.</i>

<i>It turned out nobody had made plans what to do
after Saddam was gone.</i>

<i>The America has purged everyone 
who had been loyal to the regime</i>

<i> which meant there wasn't anybody left
who knew how to run the country.</i>

<i>Rasnetsov and all the other fixers like him..</i>

<i>filled that vacuum with power
and now they control the game again.</i>

<i>Iraq spirals into anarchy,
chaos and terror.</i>

<i>All those countries that have been scamming
"Oil for Food" before the war,</i>

<i>Well, they got ready to curve Iraq up.</i>

<i>Like it was one big pie.</i>

<i>And me..</i>

<i>I was going through emotions.</i>

<i>I lost my faith in it..</i>

Hello?

<i>It's Nashim.</i>

Hey.

You ok?

<i>I need to see you. Can you come downstairs?</i>

Sure.

Michael. Good to see you.

Yeah.

I got someone you got to meet.

We need your help, Michael.

Michael Sullivan,
Mr. Shaswar Rauf.

Yeah. We've met before.

He will play a central role in a new Iraq.

You ever heard of a guy named
Rasnetsov?

Yeah.

Yeah? You've ever met him?

A few times
before the invasion.

How about after?

No. I didn't.

Well now him and his criminal gang for
"Oil for Food" are back.

And they're creating a mess in Iraq.

Yeah..

You know there was a list of individuals
and organisations that were

helping Saddam with "Oil for Food".
You guys know about that?

 Yeah. There was no way to proof what was on it.
 No.

Proof was in Iraq, all ministry.

Official files that were taken by
US troops 

after the government fell.

Proof that is probably be still
in the basement of UN

somewhere if anyone care to look.

Forget about the list.
We don't want the list anymore.

You don't want the list?
Too many powerful people.

Too political.

It is a coalition of fucking greedy. 
No one gives a shit about Iraq.

Everyone just want some money.

Yeah, that's why we need to stop Rasnetsov.

Pasha can give him to us.

Michael, we have strong intel 
that your boss is involved.

Pasha never gonna help you.

Or may be he's just need a little push.

And we're hoping that may be
you can convince him.

You think I can convince Pasha?
Pasha's never gonna do it. He's not gonna listen to you.
 
We can protect the UN for any unpleasant throwbacks.

Diplomacy.

What?

Diplomacy.

Something Pasha said to me once..

So now you're the one 
working with the criminals.

It's not the same.

Why it isn't the same?

We had the momentum now.

The Kurds are going to be in important part of
making the new era..

The Kurds been fighting the same pretty much
several thousand years. 

You really think this gonna change anything?

Who can't say?

But for sure it's not up to you 
to decide that for us

Come with me.

I can't.

Neonatal medicine.
Yeah.. There are new inventors.

French-canadians.

They want the exclusive rights
to the whole of the Northern region.

That's very greedy.
Especially for the Canadians.

Well, I can..
They need to be willing to pay hundred grand  

to make it happen.

You do the preparations with the Kurds
and the provisional authoritiy.

I'll handle the rest,
we split fifty-fifty.

Fifty thousand dollars paid off?
No, shekels.

Christ! Of course, dollars.
What the fuck!

Thank you.

Pleasure to see you again, Sir.

And so much more favorable circumstances yes?

You must be one of the Canadians.

I'm Cutter, Sir. No.

Ah..American.

I wasn't.. 

You didn't tell me the provisional authoritiy

will be sending someone for such a routine agreement.

They didn't.

We're not exactly here about medicines,
Mr. Passaris.

<i>They need to be willing to pay 
hundred grands to make this happen.</i>

<i>You do the preparations with the Kurds
and the provisional authority.</i>

<i>I handle the rest,
we split fifty-fifty.</i>

Ohh Kid...

<i>Fifty thousand dollars paid off?
No, shekels.</i>

<i>Christ of course, Dollars,
What the fuck?</i>

It's like a surprise party
without the cake.

What do you want?

Give us Timur Rasnetsov, and resign your job.

Or I will have to drag you and the United Nations
through a scandals of a stark proportions.

This happens.

With or without you.
With or without me..

Rasnetsov will be protected by multinational companies

who have governments who protect them.

Same people who just brought Saddam to his knees
and put you here.

Holding court. Judging me.

You think your place at the table now is not 
bought and paid for?

We pay with our lives
if that's what you mean.

What you called corruption
is simply the growing pains 

of the new democracy.

And you are indeed fools if you think
you can put the brakes on it now.

Let's let the politician worry about that.

We will settle for the rat..

You want me to commit suicide.

We can protect you.

You know that's not true.

Well just set up a meeting.

Give him the envelope the Canadian's deal.

We catch him red handed.

What the hell?

Not bad, Kid.

Well played.

He's late.

Yes?

Fucking country.

Is it ok if I join you?

I'm stepping down going home.

I've lost my taste for it.

I wanted you to hear it from me.

I recommended you for a position
in UNESCO.

Special assistant.

You'll be the youngest one in the whole UN.

Did you know?

Kid.

How can even you think that?

These fucking lunatics.
They are killing each other everyday.

That's the truth of it.

That's your truth, Pasha.

And I'm not part of it anymore.

Don't. Don't do anything dumb.

You can't fight the storm.

<i>NEW YORK,
SEPTEMBER, 2003</i>

<i>I realize everybody knew about the corruption.</i>

<i>They just didn't want to be exposed.</i>

<i>Every permanent member of Security Council
</i>

<i>has something to lose.</i>

<i>Someone on the list who can embarass it.</i>

<i>It will all be covered up. </i>

<i>The UN couldn't survive these lies.</i>

<i>I had to do something.</i>

<i>Risk something.</i>

<i>To make a change.</i>

If I tried to list his accomplishments,
we will be here until tomorrow.

But in his forty years of service,
to the cause of world peace and,

our humanitarian missions,
the crowning achievement would have to be

his successful implementation and
operation of "Oil for Food ".

Hi, I'm Trevor Owen from "Oversight".

I've spoke to John earlier..

Saddam's palace files..
Yeah..

Which boxes?
All of them.

They sealed to the public,
but as you're from "Oversight"

and as long as you don't take anything with you,
go crazy.

Thank you.

Mr. Passaris. Job well done.

Thank you.

Where's Michael?
He has cleaned his desk, sir.

I think I found it.

You know what we're gonna have to do?

Fucking family.

<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.</i>

<i>And I have a story
I think you're gonna want to hear.</i>

These are the wrong numbers of 
how much money was involved.

And that is billions. This is not Millions.

Jesus!

And this is the list of everyone 
who received their vouchers,

their bribes and kickbacks.

You can corroborate the names
with the deposit records.

They're here

with the list of contracts on files.

This is massive, Jesse.

You realize the minute this breaks
you'll have a lot of enemies?

Yeah, I know.

We could protect you.

Cite you as "A confidential source."

No, anonymity is part of the problem.

If nobody takes responsibility for the truth,
then we are leaving up to consensus.

I have to own it.

We began with this evening 
with the United Nations, the "Oil for Food"

controversies and scandal.

And the call on the part of the United States Senator
for the resignation of Kofi Annan.

Obviously, these are serious allegations

which we take seriously.

The UN Secretary General today ordered
an investigation on Costa Passaris,

the former Under-Secretary who has 
whistelblower claims

was behind the "Oil for Food" scandals
that has rocked the United Nations.

And implicated a long list of prominent businessmen

and political figures across the world.

Incompetent and corrupt.

The weaknesses is in the "Oil for Food" program..

raises serious questions about 
the United Nations' ability

to enforce sanctions and administrated
mandated program in the future.

<i>The documents for the telegraph
come up with</i>

<i>reportedly found in Iraq's foreign ministry archive.</i>

<i> days after the US led the invasions.</i>

<i>The "Wall Street Journal"
report having documentations of </i>

<i>kickbacks, and bribes and
 forms of oil vouchers...</i>

<i>worth billions of dollars.</i>

<i>But according to federal authority,</i>

<i>Passaris himself has fled the country.</i>

<i>CYPRUS,
MAY, 2004</i>

I'm with the "Wall Street Journal".

We're doing a follow up

on the "Oil for Food" scandals.

I come to get your side of the story.

I don't have a side.

And it's the kid's fucking story.

I'm not running away.
Ok?

Make sure you write that.

I'm not hiding from anybody.

Yet here you are in a place without extradition.
It was difficult.

Write that.

Complicated.

Messy was Saddam's ugly nonsense
and the usual first world duplicity.

But we did more good than bad.

I don't care what anybody fucking said.

And the kid did great.

<i>The choice is I see it,
it's between cynicism and candor.</i>

You know if only we care so much about Iraq 
as said,

the story would have been celebrated 
as a conspiracy of Saint.

But the truth..

The truth isn't about the lie we told each other.

It's about the lie we told ourselves.

<i>More than two thousands companies
from 56 different countries</i>

<i>took bribes or paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein.</i>

<i>Over twenty billion dollars got diverted
</i>

<i>from the "Oil for Food" program.</i>

<i>Implicated some of the most prestigious
coroperations in the world.</i>

<i>172 organisations and individuals
highly placed in the government</i>

<i>received bribes.</i>

<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.
My father was a diplomat.</i>

<i>I tried to follow him in his foot steps.</i>
