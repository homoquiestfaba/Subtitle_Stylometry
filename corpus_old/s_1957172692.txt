What's going on here?

Hey, Uncle Rick.

Max, you know where the key is.

You don't have to break intoyour own house.

I just wanted to grab this gamefor tonight at Scott's.

Hey, Mr. Brinkley.

Hi, Mr. Brinkley.

Is that equipment from myoffice?

Yeah. But we'll have it back in the morning.

I've got work to do. Reset thelasers.

We had a breach of security lastnight at the residence of Rick Brinkley.

We picked this up from asurveillance satellite
 monitoring the house.

The intruders entered through asecond story window on the southside of the residence.

They disabled what was supposed to be

a very sophisticated laser alarm system and were able to getinside.

What was their mission?

To pick up a video game.

It's the Brinkley kid again and his two best friends.

Sir, why do we have satellitesmonitoring this house?

Rick Brinkley is CEO of Brinkley Technologies.

He's under constant surveillancefor his own protection.

His company is developing the super computer...

a top secret tracking anddecoding system for the
 government.

He's also the legal guardian to his nephew Max Brinkley.

Max's parents died in anavalanche when he was two years old.

Rick Brinkley's raised him eversince.

Isn't this the third breach ofsecurity in two months by this kid?

Yes. It's an embarrassment tothe department.

It's amazing a kid so youngcould beat such a sophisticated security system.

He doesn't work alone. His two best friends are involved.

This is Jessica Taylor.

A decorated athlete in kickboxing and Lacrosse.

Scott Sanders is a computer wiz. Adept at hacking and breaking
 encryption.

They look like harmless kids.

Are they?

We're not really sure.

[school bell rings]

What class do you have?

Health with Swingleham.

She scares me.

Me, too.

Max Brinkley, get to class.

Now.

I have to go.

Here's some more cards.

See ya later.

See ya at lunch duty.

So again, I would like to pointout the human skeletal
 structure.

This is the spinal column made up of tiny vertebrae.

This is the femur.

The patella. The patella is the triangular bone...

at the front of the knee joint.

You should also notate the femur is the strongest and largest bone in the body.

What did you do next?

Oh I so told him off.

It's official. We're through.

It's over.

Girls!

Even though the school year is winding down,

I will not tolerate students breaking the rules in my classroom.

Students can expect to be dealtwith in an extreme way.

Anymore talking out of anyone will lead to suspension!

A trip to the principal's office and if it were up to
me...expulsion.

Hey, Max.

Hi.

Hi, Max.

Hey.

Yo, Max, my man.

Here you go, don't be late.

Ten bucks says he doesn't go through with it.

Of course he will.

Max is still in trouble fromwater ballooning those teachers last week.

Have a little faith, dude, he'spulled through before.

I heard a rumor, Max is pulling something big off today.

Yeah, you didn't get one ofthese?

Hey, did you hear what Max is planning at lunch?

Yeah, he's planning on protesting against how much homework teachers give out.

No way! He did that last year.

It didn't work. They assigned him twice as much after that.

Really?

Yeah.

[whistle blows]

He'll probably freak out at thelast minute and call the whole thing off.

You're new to this school,right?

Yeah.

Then you don't know Max very well. Just wait and see.

That new infrared telescope your Uncle's company made was awesome.

I was surprised by the light sensitivity it had.

Yeah, he's coming out with a newmodel.

It has twice the power.

Will he still let us borrow his equipment after last night?

Of course. We just have to laylow for a couple days.

Hey, bro.

How much time did you get for that water balloon incident?

Oh!

Those kids are throwing waterballoons at us!

You get down here right this instant.

Right now!

Max! You're gonna pay for this!

I'll see to that!

Two weeks cafeteria duty.

This is a breeze.

There she is.

Go talk to her.

No. I got a hair net on, man.

Max, girls like attention.

Luckily there just isn't time.

Food fight!


[whistle blows]

Mark Bean's sister got her license.

This school's outta control.

And so are you.

Look, Max, orchestrating that food fight was way over the line.

How could you even suggest thatI had any part?

I found all these little cardsyou had printed on the back of your Uncle's stationery.

It appears that if you hold thepaper up to the light,

Brinkley Technologies readsright through.

I'm no idiot. I know that's your Uncle's company.

Look. We were testing the school's emergency response time.

Two minutes thirty two secondsMr. Henderson. That's not very good.

As noble as that was, Max you now owe one hundred hours ofcommunity service to the school.

One hundred hours? But...I had it down to fifty.

Do you have a pen?

I'll need that back.

Lucky for you, Max, I have a wayfor you to work off those hours.

â™ª

Because of the trouble you'vecaused,

I'm volunteering you for a different kind of community service.

Nothing else has worked for youanyway.

There's a videogame company that has made some very large donations to our school.

They've asked me to find kids totest some software they've just developed.

You, Jessica and Scott are those kids.

They weren't involved in this.

Don't even try to play me like a fool.

I've got a stack of paperwork a mile long since kindergarten

pairing you with Jessica andScott.

They were in on this food fight.

I know, I'm sure of it.

Your interview at Game Ink will begin promptly at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

You'd better make a good impression.

Thanks for not selling us out.

I don't rat on friends.

I've never been on an interview.

Guys, we get to miss school for this.

I'm in.

Me, too.

â™ª

â™ª

[heavy door opening]

[heavy door opening]

Uncle Rick? You home?

Yeah, Max.

I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to make it home 'til late.

I forgot I have a dinner meeting with an important...so uh--

â™ª

â™ª

Jess, call me when you're finished.

We can just walk from here, Mom. It's not that far.

Thanks, Mrs. Taylor.

Any time, Max.

Ten o'clock would be great.

Okay, see you then. Bye-bye.

Hi! Are you the kids meeting with Jeff?

Yeah.

Did you bring resumes?

Kickboxing, self-defense.

Mm.

Lawn mowing.

Wire tapping.

Hacking?

[little laugh]

Extreme tactical training.

What's Brinkley Technologies?

I'd rather not say.

It's high tech.

Oh.

Hi. I'm Jeff.

Thanks so much for comin' bytoday.

Well follow me.

I'm the Assistant Manager of Development at Game Ink.

Here we've created such games asMutant Mutilator, The Monster 11 Series...

Mutant Mutilator was awesome!


I can't believe this counts for community service.

This is the game room.

Wow.

This is where we test all of the new products we've developed.

Currently we are testing six newgames.

This isn't supposed to be out yet.

That's right. It's a beta version.

It actually won't be sold until after Christmas.

And this is Mr. Daniels.

The Director of Research and Development.

Mr. Daniels...

this is Scott, Jessica and Max.

Thanks for taking the time tocome and meet with us.

Now... when can you start?

Are you serious? Today!

Yeah.

Good.

We'll need your parents to sign these forms.

Here ya are.

And here are your access cards so you can get into the game room on your own.

Awesome.

Cool.

Yeah.

Oh, I forgot something in the game room.

No problem. Just use your access card.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Your mission is a go. The discyou received outlines the entire plan.

For me to take this kind of risk I'm gonna need more money.

A deal's a deal.

Memorize the plan. Then I want that disc back so it can be destroyed.

Okay. I'll stick with the plan.

Oh, sorry about that.

What are you doin' here?

I forgot my pen.

I see.

No.

I'll clean it up.

We should get back to school.

Hey. It's still early.

Radio check.

I'm on.

Me, too.

Guys, I have something to tell you.

What is it, Max?

I overheard Mr. Daniels talking on the phone.

You were eavesdropping?

What did he say?

He's got some sort of weird plangoing on. I don't trust the guy.

What do you mean?

He has a plan on a disc.

I bumped into him and it fell out of his briefcase so I borrowed it.

Borrowed it! You mean you took a disc from Game Ink?

No, I borrowed it from Mr. Daniels.

I can't believe this. We're gonna get fired.

I'll check the disc out tonight.

Let I don't wanna know.

Let's get back to class.

This is a serious subject.

I will not be made a fool of.

We're late!

Now class these are the human reproductive organs.

Otherwise known as the--

Yo, Max.

You're just in time.


[start laughing]

No!


This needs to be taken
 seriously.

I--

You--

Stop! This needs to be taken seriously!

Glad you could make it, man.

Well. Now where were we?

[bell rings]

Hi Jessica.

Hi.

Does she like Max or something?

No, she just hangs out with boys.

It's okay. They don't have half as much fun as we do, Jess.

Yeah, no kidding.

Hello, Jessica.

Hi, Bean.

I still haven't heard back onour possible interstellar date.

My chauffeur...I mean sister, just got her license and she owes me.

Yeah. I've been meaning to get back to you on that one. I'm thinking no.

[small gasp]

You're not my type, Bean.

No?

Attention, attention.

Only a week until the schooldance.

Be sure and get all your library books in

if you want to attend this exciting end-of-the-year activity.

Hi, Max.

Only a week.

Oh and Max, do your homeworktonight if you want to stay out of summer school.

[camera snaps]

These are the security logs for everyone in and out of the building last night.

The vault itself has a
 fingerprint scan

which only opens to people with top level security clearance.

But h- how is this relevant?

Sir, according to our logs, yourfingerprints were used to break into the vault last night.

My fingerprints? How could that be possible?

They could've been taken from adoor handle or even a pop can.

So what's missing from thevault?

We're still trying to determine that.

Looks like only one microchip is missing.

What is it?

It's called the IMX-7 chip.

We're doing our best todetermine what it is right now.

But there are over five hundred microchips in that vault.

So it'll take time.

The lead developer is ascientist named Kenneth Nimble.

Get him over here.

At 8 a.m. Eastern time yesterday morning,

it was discovered that a top secret microchip was stolen

from a heavily guarded vaultinside the FBI.

All major governmental agencies have been notified and...

joint investigations involving the FBI, the CIA and the NSA have begun.

I cannot disclose what information was on the chip,

however, all of the government'sresources are at the disposal of the investigative teams.

That is all I can say at this
 time. Thank you.

[overlapping shouting out questions]

Sir, the FBI Director is on his way to meet with you.

Most likely he'll ask youquestions regarding the
 microchip.

Tell him what you know andthis'll be over before you know it.

Here he is.

Hello. Jim Kelly.

Kenneth Nimble.

Doctor Nimble, what can you tellme about what's on this stolen chip?

This chip holds sophisticated fingerprint technology...

including fingerprints of top military leaders...

U.S. Senators, Congressmen...

and the President of the UnitedStates.

Does this chip have some kind of a tracking device in it so we can at least find it?

No one thought it could ever bestolen.

And no one believed the Titanic could sink.

The Secretary of Defense wouldlike an update.

Thank you, I'm almost done here.

Doctor Nimble, why would somebody want to steal this chip?

Someone could infiltrate topsecret facilities, underground bunkers.

The possibilities of someone with access to these fingerprints are endless.

Thank you for your time, Doctor
Nimble.

Mr. Kelly.

If I were you, I'd put all mytime into finding this chip...before it's too late.

â™ª

â™ª

Looks like a dumb game.

Oh, yeah.

This could take awhile.

[sound of door]

Hey Max, I'm home.

Hey.

Did you have a good day?

I did...until your principal called me.

He says you organized a food fight yesterday.

[a little laugh]

Max, you can't act like this.

Well, we were just having some fun.

Fun?

If I hear of any more trouble atschool you're grounded.

Sorry.

I'm going to bed. So should you.

Can I ask you a question?

What is it, Max?

What were my parents like?

A lot like you. Hm. Fun, adventurous. [little chuckle]

You dad was a real troublemaker.

Get to bed.

Wow.

What is this?

Jessica.

Scott.

No way, Max. I'm not doing anymore of these missions.

We have to meet.

What? It's midnight, Max.

I know, but this is important.

Scott!

What? I'm sleeping. It's nighttime.

I was right about Daniels.

I've got proof. We have to meet. Now.

Let's go, Scott.

Okay.

We have to make this quick. My parents think I'm asleep.

Me, too.

What is it?

I don't know. But it's not a computer game. Watch.

Restricted Access. For the eyes of Tom Daniels only.

Enter through undergroundutility tunnel.

Bypass security door using small explosives.

Move through security room into boat hangar.

The chip is being stored onboard in the rear engine room.

It's protected by a lock boxwhich you will have the key to.

Inside is the IMX-7 computer chip.

If the security door alarm istripped you'll have two minutes to get out safely.

This is a weird disc. Take a look at the paper.

The stolen chip is being kept at the location on this disc.

We better call the police.

We can't exactly do that.

Remember the situation with the police chief last summer?

Oh yeah.

You had mall security arrest him.

Well it looked like he was shoplifting.

How was I supposed to know hewas undercover?

You're the last person the copswant to hear from, Max.

So...I was thinking...

No, no, no.

I know what you're thinking, Max.

Not gonna happen.

Scott, some day you'll learn that you have to take risks.

On my fortieth birthday I wannabe able to look back at when Iwas a kid and say that,

that I took chances.

Besides we'd be doing the FBI a big favor.

I'm in.

So...are you in?

I hope I live through this.

[alarm beeps]

â™ª

â™ª

So Max, you gonna ask anyone to the dance?

He's gonna ask Nicole.

I don't know. What about you guys?

I'm not going.

Me either. I bet it wouldn't even be cool.

I'm sure Bean would love to go.

Ew, that's gross.

Why don't you just go together?

Yeah, right.

Forget it.

We need to find out when and where the robbery's takingplace.

Just stick with the plan.

Whenever you guys don't stick with the plan things go bad.

Hi, kids. What are you doing here today?

We need to get Mr. Daniels' address.

To deliver something.

What is it?

Confidential.

No offense.

I'm not allowed to give that information out.

May I use the restroom?

â™ª

â™ª

Max!

What are you doing here?

We came to drop off these forms.

Hey, guys.

Do you have your forms?

Oh yeah.

Well thanks.

Phew.

Let's go

â™ª

This is it.

Now what? He's not home.

I'm gonna go look around and seewhat's inside.

I'll come with you.

You guys are crazy!

Scott, we always break intohouses.

Yeah. Our own.

Radio to us if he comes back.

â™ª

Not much of a gardener.

â™ª

â™ª

The fridge is empty.

Oh. They had to go inside.


Let's see what he's got here.

We should get outta here.

He's coming!

Get outta there!

Go!

â™ª

â™ª

Ew.

[phone rings]


Do you have any final questions?


I stole the chip when the opportunity presented itself.

Uh-huh.

It was placed on the boat to see if the FBI had put a tracking system on the chip.

Now I've hired you to retrieve it for me.

So there's a slight possibility that half the FBI will bewaiting for me.

You're being well compensatedfor this mission. I suggest you change your attitude.

I want the disc back so I can destroy the plan.

The disc is gone from my briefcase.

What?!

Find that disc.

Max, we have to get the disc back.

He'll know it's us if we don't.

We have to know where the chip is.

Here's something.

Hurry up!

I know where the disc is. Yeah,it fell out of my briefcase at Game Ink.

I'm on my way there now to get it.

I'm glad he didn't catch you guys.

Hurry.

Come on Scott!

What's goin' on?

Grab your bike.

â™ª

Oh, come on! Look at all thistraffic. I got a family to feed, let's go!

We need to get to Game Ink onFourth Street.

I'm on a lunch break.

I can eat later.


Get there as fast as you can.

I love this stuff.

[tires squeal]

Maybe you should slow down alittle.

Hurry up!

This guy is crazy.

[mumbling - frightened]

Watch out!

Whoo-hoo - yeah!

Havin' fun?


Get down!

What a rush!

Ha. I'll drive you guys around anytime.

Hah!

Name is Reggie.

Thanks, man.

Yeah, thanks.

We better run.

[siren up/stops]

I clocked ya at sixty.

Didn't you see the cab?

What cab?

Lemme see your license and registration.

Where should we put it?

Exactly where it was.

Let's get outta here.

I can't find it.

Step outta the car.

It's got to mean something.

What's the date?

The third.

Then tomorrow is the fourth.

It's the date and time. That'sday after tomorrow at one a.m.

Wow, Scott. You're a human code breaker.

We better have a plan.


Scott will run electronics. He'll be our eyes and ears allnight.

Jessica you'll be with me.

Jessica and I will plant the Brinkley Lock on the security door.

It's a remote locking device.

Once they break into thewarehouse we'll lock them in and call the police.

How are we going to get past the security door? It's probably encrypted.

The super computer.

It's the smallest, most portable, lightest, most aerodynamic,

fireproof, bulletproof,
 radar-proof, computer

that will break through any security system.

Phew...

I've got a meeting scheduledwith my uncle for after school tomorrow.

We'll need to borrow the super computer.

How are we going to get to the warehouse?

I'm not ridin' with that Reggie guy again.

Bean's sister!

No way! I'm not talking to him.

I'm not.

No, Lord Zarenex would win. You know Pluto's not as big.

Yeah, but Zarenex doesn't have a shield to defend himself.

He's futile.

Leave me.

Hi Jessica.

Hi, Bean. I have a favor to ask.

Favor? Continue.

Are you gonna ask her to the dance or not?

Of course. I'm just waiting forthe right time.

Don't be such a wimp.

You're the one who says takechances and laugh in the face ofdanger.

Go.

So, you're Nicole, right?

Yes.

Well, my name is...

Max?

Yeah. How'd you know?

I've seen you around.

Oh. Well, I wanted to ask you...

Max Brinkley come to my office.

I can't believe this.

Now Brinkley.

Stay right here. I'll be right back.


I'm in. I'll talk to her tonight and there's no way she canrefuse.

Great.

Goodbye, my sweet.

What'd I do this time, Mr. Henderson?

Hello, Max. Sit down.

I just wanted to congratulateyou on getting that job at Game Ink.

I must say I'm impressed.

But...so I'm not in trouble?

Well...not yet.

Then I have to go!

â™ª

I hear what you're saying, Mr. President,

but...if you want this contract done on time we need an extra hundred million.

He's talking to the president.

Okay.

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Nice talking to you too, sir.  [hangs up]

Max, I really don't have time.

I'm late for a meeting. Make itquick.

Scott and I need to borrow somespecial equipment for a project that we're doing.

If I lend you more equipment youbetter get an A on this
 assignment.

Most definitely.

Of course we will, Mr. Brinkley.

So, we can borrow anything?

Just grab what you need. Makesure you sign for it in front of the guards.

I have to go.

I'll see you tonight, Max.

He said we could borrow
 anything.

I don't think he meant the stuff in that room.

It's top secret.

â™ª

â™ª

There it is.

I don't know about this.

We'll be sure to return it.

Return it?

This isn't a library.

Trust me.

Have I ever gotten you in trouble?

[phone rings]

Brinkley.

Oh we're just finished running the test phase on the super computer.

Broke even the toughest
 encryption.

We've only got a prototype but,uh, I'm glad to consider giving your company a first look.

What's in the bag, Max?

A computer.

Is it yours?

No. It's my uncle's.

Oh, is it one of those fast ones?

Ho-oh, yeah.

Jessica come in here, I've gotsomething to show you.

Okay, Mom.

What do you think?

A dress.

Do you like it?

Nice color but I haven't beenasked to the dance yet.

I hear you have quite a few secret admirers.

Jess, you there?

Just a minute, Max, I'm talking with my Mom.

Thanks for the dress, Mom.

You're welcome Jess. Get ready for bed.

Max? I'll see you in an hour.

â™ª

â™ª

Bye Mom! I'm going to Max's!

You be careful Scott.

That Max Brinkley's a little wild.

Don't want you getting hurtfalling out of trees or whatever it is you kids do.

He'll be fine, dear.

â™ª

Bye, guys.


What are you doing out when you're grounded?

You scared me to death!

I would hate for Mom and Dad to find out about this.

What? Are you blackmailing me?

Grab your keys.

Where are they?

They'll be here.

This was a terrible idea.

Just chill, Scott.

[car engine]

â™ª

â™ª

Hurry up!

Let's go.

Bean told me what you guys areup to.

Sounded pretty cool, that's why I decided to help you out.

You didn't have a choice. I blackmailed you.

Shut up, Mark.

Guys, chill.

Please.

No messing up.

It's 11:25.

Time for set-up.

Here's the radio so you can hear what's going on.

Stay in that parking lot overthere.

Bean, you're the man.

I'm the man.

No you're not.

â™ª

Daniels will be here at one a.m.

If not earlier.

We need to be out by midnight at the latest.

That's twenty-eight minutes.

Let's go.

â™ª

Radio check.

Night vision's working.

Bye Scott.

Don't change the plan.

We're in.

â™ª

I'm now activating the super computer.

This is so cool.

Where do you get all this stuff?

That's classified information.

You'll hit the security door in about a hundred feet.

We see the door.

I'm about to insert the key card.

Go ahead, Max.

I'm now uploading.

It worked. The access code isseven four seven nine three one.

Seven four seven nine three one.

Access granted.

There's a camera in there.

Oh, my gosh.

We have to set the Brinkley lock on this door.

Scott, run the program for theBrinkley Lock.

Copy.

The Brinkley Lock is set.

We're on our way back.

â™ª

Wait.

Max! What are you doing?

I'm going to get the chip.

Max, that's crazy.

It's the only way we'll be sure it's safe.

What's going on?

There's no way in.

Yeah there is.

If you're doing what I thinkyou're doing...

I can't believe this!

I should've known.

They're both highly erratic.

They've got guts.

Take notes, little Bean. You could learn a thing or two.

Max, I know what you're doing. I won't get mad if you just call me back.

This is crazy. You're gonna getcaught.

Scott chill.

They always change the plan.

I can't believe this.

Scott, calm down.

We're not gonna get caught.

It's the same as breaking in your house. No big deal.

I'm now going radio silent.

â™ª

â™ª


â™ª

Scott, Jessica, I've got the chip.

I'm on my way back.

You got the chip?!

We're almost there, Scott.

Open the grate.

â™ª

â™ª

Good evening, Max.

I don't think so.

Let me go!

Oh. And your girlfriend better come up, too.

Forget it.

That's not wise, Jessica.

Now get up here before Max has a little accident.

That was very sneaky of you to break into the warehouse.

I think you've got my chip.

What chip?

You know we don't have time for this.

I have the chip.

We're really sorry.

Here it is.

Oof!

Run Jess!

Well hey guys. What's up?

Surprise, surprise.

The plot thickens.

Hello?

Oh, Bill, it's- it's RickBrinkley. I'm sorry to call so late.

Hi, Rick. What can I do for you?

Is Max over at your house?

No. Scott told us he was stayingat your house tonight.

No, they're not here. I'vechecked everywhere. Something'swrong.

I don't know how you did it butI'd like to thank you for doing the work.

And you, Miss Firecracker...

nice kick.

We're cut and ready to go.

Good.

Well, uh, heh, I g- I guess we won't be able to make videogames together after all. Huh?

It's too bad. Heh. Ha. Well, uh, bye-bye for now.

[sound of car starting]

[muffled voices]

Oh...I never had stuff like this when I was a kid.

What's this?

Huh, it's a funny little laptop.

Would you stop playing with their toys?

Those kids are pretty smartafter all, huh?

Yeah well they weren't smartenough.

They're the one's that are duct taped right now.

You know, nothing would've gonewrong if you hadn't shown them the plan.

Well I didn't show them theplan, the kid stole it from me.

Okay, would you just stop waving that around?

It's fun.

[sound of metal hitting the asphalt.]

Why'd you do that?

'Cause it was fun.

[muffled voices]

Nail clippers.

â™ª

What did you get me into?

It's not my fault!

[cell phone rings]

Hello? Hey Alex, how's the concert?

Hey! I was talking on that!

You know you have the mostbeautiful eyes.

Thanks.

I don't think I've ever beengiven so many compliments in onenight.

Well you better get used to it, baby. [chuckles]

What is it you do?

Well you know I'm a cab driver by day...

Oh.

[Reggie's phone rings]

Excuse me for a second. I gotta take this.

Yo, talk to me.

It's Max. You gotta help us out,Reggie. We need a ride.

Hey, hey, hey Max. Hey, slow down, okay?

Yeah. I knew that.

My boyfriend's waiting for me so I have to go but it was great seeing you.

Yeah, likewise.

Look kid. Where are you?

Can't believe you guys called me at this hour.

I do have a life, you know.

I expect a big tip for saving your butts again.

Who are you?

I'll tell you who I am.

Obviously the only cab driver inthe city. Hah.


This has been the worst night of my life!

I was blackmailed by my brotherinto this. I don't even wanna be here.

I'm supposed to be at a concert right now!

Mark, we're getting out.

Right up here. Please pull over and stop.

I was duct taped.


We need to get in.

What's goin' on, Max?

It's an emergency.

[ding!]

The satellite'll be out of range soon so we have to hurry.

I've only used this thing once.

My uncle would kill us if he knew we were in here.

â™ª

Good thing they took the super computer.

This better work.

It's searching. Give it aminute.

They're close. We're gettingcoordinates on the map.

It worked!

You know, I don't think I wanna work with you again.

You don't wanna work with me?

Jeez.

You have a temper.

I don't have a temper!

See? You do.

I think it's time to make a call.

Yeah.

State your emergency.

Daniels, is the missioncomplete? Do you have the chip?

Yeah, we got the chip. We ship
 out in ten minutes.

Did you transfer the funds?

I'll transfer the funds when thechip is back in my possession.

These goggles are so cool.

That's good. Thank you very much.

Oh! [laughs]

What's going on?

How do you feel about being caught by a bunch of kids?


Police! Stop!

What--

[random shouting]

Freeze!

Get them!

Freeze!

â™ª

We have breaking news.

Two unidentified men have been arrested

in an attempt to steal a topsecret government computer chip.

In a bizarre turn of events,Kenneth Nimble, a top military scientist,

has been implicated in the theft of the missing FBI microchip.

Doctor Nimble was lead developerof the top secret IMX-7 project,

utilizing state of the artfingerprint technology.

We've learned from officials that Kenneth Nimble

was outspoken in his believe that the microchip and other sensitive information

weren't being properly secured.

Dr. Nimble?

You don't understand!

Our government secrets need better protection!

I should be honored for my work. I'm a genius!

â™ª

What is this?

Testing.

One. Two. Three.

What were you planning to doafter you set the remote lock?

Wait until Mr. Daniels was inside the warehouse and call the police.

So you did break into the warehouse?

I've known both Max and Scott for over seven years.

Is this your first major offense?

Offense? We got the chip back, didn't we?

So who made the plan? Was itjust one of you? Or did you all three contribute?

Look, I'm not a bad kid.

Normally, I wouldn't eveninvolve myself in this type of situation.

So you were involved.

You realize how many laws youand your friends broke?

We could put you in prison forthis. You withheld evidence...

[door opens]

I'm Agent Riles. You need to leave. Immediately.

Max you should have taken the disc you found to the police.

Moving forward on your own wasirresponsible.

Frankly, you're in a lotta trouble.

With that being said,

your activities have caught theattention of some people in very high places.

Are you with the FBI?

Max, I'm with a top secretorganization known as the SecretBureau.

Reggie?

That's actually Agent Jeffries.

He's with Division 2A in charge of undercover operations.


I love this stuff!

[horn honks]

I'll drive you guys around anytime. The name is Reggie.

We've been watching you and your friends for some time, Max.

For the past year Agent Kensey -A-K-A Mrs. Swingleham, has been psychologically testing you.

My health teacher?

Anymore talking out of anyone will lead to suspension!

No way.

We haven't got much time.

Sir? We're sending in theothers.

Mrs. Swingleham?!

Hum.

We have an offer to make you wehope you won't refuse.

Simply put, there are times whenyoung agents are needed

to pull off secret operations in which too much suspicion surrounds our adult agents.

The government wants you to work for us. Undercover.

Oh...

No way!

You'd still have to do your homework.

I'm in.

Sure.

No problem.

The kids need a ride to the warehouse.

[a couple siren burst/tires chirp to a stop]

Uncle Rick! You're here!

Max!

Scott! My baby.

Mom! Dad!

Jessica!

Mom!

There you are.

You're all right. Where have you been?

What happened?

We had so much fun.

I'm okay, Mom.

I'm fine.


I'm sorry for not telling youabout all this.

I'm just glad you're okay.

I was worried.

I want a full report on everything that happened tonight.

Oh, sure.

Your parents would be so proudof you.

Thanks.

This yours?

Oh.

I forgot to tell you.

Thanks for letting us borrow thesuper computer.

â™ª

All right, Max. [laughs] Yes.

M'lady.

All right now. [laughs] All right. Hey, good luck, kids.

[music and voices]

Good evening. Excuse me.

[mic squawks]

Welcome to the dance!

It's been a long year.

Too long. But, we want you toenjoy the festivities, withoutbecoming too...festive.

But, let there be no funny business.

Any funny business will be dealtwith accordingly. So...

[tires screaching to a halt]

Thanks for your transportation.

You owe me.

Hi, Jessica.

Hi, Bean.

Hey, Bean.

You know Bean, you're a lotcooler than I thought you were.

Thanks, Jess.

â™ª

â™ª

I'm tired from all that dancing.

Me, too. You were very good.

Really? You, too.

â™ª

I never had a chance to tell youbut that's pretty amazing what you did.

Ah, nah.

It was.

You know, it's funny. It took meso long to get the guts to ask you to the dance.

[walkie-talkie blurts]

Max! You only have one minute!

I just remembered. We have to go.

We don't have much time.

What? What's happening?

Scott, Jessica, ETA twenty seconds.

Copy, Max.


I have a visual.

You're right on time.

There wasn't much traffic.

You must be Nicole.

Pleased to meet you, Mr. Brinkley.

I've heard a lot about you.

Really?

Hey, Mr. Brinkley.

Hi, Mr. Brinkley.

Hi kids. Well hop in.

Whoa, a helicopter.

There we go.

The President wanted you to have this.

Whoa.

Cool.

Cool.

He seemed really impressed thatyou three kids

could do something that ten government agencies couldn't.

[whir of helicopter blades]


See ya.

Bye!

Bye...

Thanks for picking us up.

Anytime, Max.

And now we're going live to anews conference in Washington DC

where FBI Director Jim Kelly is expected to speak.

Thanks to the diligence of Max Brinkley and his friends,

Jessica Taylor and Scott Sanders,

the fingerprints of our nation's leaders are now safe.

[school bell]

â™ª

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd liketo thank you for arriving here today on such short notice.

This is our newest target.

Sir, have we placed agents closeto him?

No. He's avoided all agents thus far.

What do you recommend we do?

We bring in special agents Max, Jessica and Scott.

I've had good luck with them in the past.

What are they doing now?

They're teenagers.

[tires screaching]

Wow.

Okay.

That's good.

Thanks. I've had a little practice.

Okay, now see that's a littletoo fast, Max.

This wouldn't be safe on the road at all, okay?

Uh, look, I really think we should move on to parallel parking now, okay?

Okay.

Whooo...

ooooo... ooooo... ooooo... ooaa!

Like that?

Max, how are you?

I just passed my driver's test.

Uh, we'll see about that.

We need you at Headquarters for briefing.

Right away, Sir.

Good.

I really should get going.

Going?

You can't go anywhere, you don'teven have your license.

Oh, I do.

It's only good for when I'mworking though.

Scott! Get in here.

We need our secret weapon.

All right boys, we are down byfive points and we have thirty-nine seconds left.

Everybody knows what's at stake
 here.

Winning a scrimmage?

McGuire, you're gonna fake a pass to Schmitty then double back.

Scott.

When McGuire passes you the ball catch it and run into the end zone.

Break! Go-go-go!

Grrrrr.

Blue, ninety-one. Hike!

Run it again!

Hike!

Yes!

No!

Man.

Run it again!

Ready?

Break.

[cell phone rings]

Go!

Yes!

Where is that kid goin'?



[cell phone rings]

[phone rings]

[phone rings]


Three years ago I took a chance on these highly skilled kids.

I inducted them into the agency.

Since then they've completed forty-three assignments over four continents.

Sir, are these the agents who recovered the Prime Minister last Fall?

And restored him to power.

Are they still active?

Highly.

Amazing.
