Yo, is anybody working or, uh...

You know what you want or what?

Yeah. Can I get three

Right.

(FAKE SNEEZES)

(JAY MUTTERING)

JAY: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

What 'cha looking at, man?

That's how we did it
in the '90s, son!

(ALL WHISTLING HAPPY TUNE)

Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

(DOORBELL RINGS)
(COLTRANE WHISTLES)

Your whistling is
affecting your carrying.

(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

Pretty nifty planning.

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)


The fuck?

Oh, uh... well,
'cause, um,

nifty is slang for NFT,

which is a non-fungible
token in our world.

"Our world"?

Oh, my God, I knew it.

You belong to one of
these religious death cults

where they all wear
sneakers to bed

before they kill themselves.

For the last time, Randal,

I'm not in a
religious death cult.

Block chain Coltrane
and I are co-founders

of the Christian Crypto Club.

(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>â™ª Rip and tear! â™ª</i>

This is either a <i>Lord
of the Rings</i> thing

or a Jesus thing.
Hmm.


(ELIAS CHUCKLING)

Block chain says that
Jesus saves souls,

but we buy souls,
it's... (SPUTTERS)

It's pretty clever wordplay

because the Phantasma
Chain's cryptocurrency unit

is called the Soul, so...


You are killing me
this morning, you nut.

Oh, shit,

I think I get it now.

Get what?
NFTs and crypto?

No, not that Beanie
Baby bullshit.

Talking about this pair of puds.

Looks like Elias has
got his own Silent Bob.

Oh, this is quite a hand job.

What?

Jesus, these Gen Z
kids are fucked.

ELIAS: Oh,
what a surprise.

Randal has taken the Lord's
name in vain again, Mr. Dante.

Please stop calling me
Mr. Dante.

You're 36-years-old.

And not for nothing,

but how's it taking
the Lord's name in vain

if I don't pray
to your Christian God?

If you don't pray to God,
then who do you pray to?

When I'm at my lowest,
I always pray to Crom.

Who's Crom?

That's Conan
the Barbarian's God.

ELIAS: You know
what, Randal?

I really wish you
didn't worship all your

false comic book idols
and satanic superheroes.

Batman, The Avengers,
Wonder Woman, AOC.

Come on, man,
give Crom a chance.

He may not be all woke
and shit like Jesus,

but homeboy's pretty
metal for a deity.

Well, joke's on you, Randal,
because there's only one God.

Yeah. What about Thor?
Thor's a god.

Thor is a fictional character
who flies through outer space.

So is your God.

Mr. Dante.

His God is the living
Christ, Randal.

His God is the Living Dead

with all that goth-y shit like,

drink my blood. That's
fucking vampire talk.

Mr. Dante!
Oh, no.

My name is Foo-Foo and
this is between you two.


(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, freeze.

What the fuck are these?

Kites.
No shit.

But what are they doing here?

I thought we could sell them.

Are you serious? Who
the fuck flies kites anymore?

Lots of people.

Kids today love flying
kites. Kites are cool.

What century is
this, Ben Franklin,

and what kind of kid
in this day and age

would be remotely interested

in buying or flying
a fucking kite?

Did you see they have
Jesus on them?

Oh, well, all the
kids love Jesus.

Who in their right
mind is gonna buy

one of your creepy Christ kites?

I would.

You did, like, 30 times.

Maybe we can sell some online.

RANDAL: Online?

The only way anyone
on the Internet

would care about
this old-timey bullshit

is if you shot a
TikTok trying to jam

one of those Jesus kites
up your Christian dick hole.

(BOTH GIGGLING)

Asshole.
Thank you.

You know what, Randal? I
don't think there's anything

particularly "metal"
about blasphemy.

Shah, blasphemy and
biting off a bat's head

are as metal as it gets.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

There were two men who were
crucified with Jesus, Randal.


A good thief and a bad thief.

If they were caught, I'd say

that makes them both
bad thieves.

The bad thief said,

"If you are really
the son of God,

"get us down from here
and save us."

So why is this guy
called "The bad thief"?

Call him "The practical thief
with common fucking sense."

Ah. But the good
thief said,

"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

What the fuck are butt thieves?

Uh, well, then
the good thief said,

"Jesus, remember me
in your kingdom."

And Jesus said
to the good thief,

"Today, you shall be
with me in paradise."

And Paradise is a strip club.

It's not a strip club, Randal.

It's Heaven.

So the moral of your
never ending story is,

even in Heaven, it's
all about who you know.

(INHALES SHARPLY)
The moral of the story

is if you didn't go to
Heaven as a guest of Jesus,

like the good thief,

where did the bad
thief go, Randal?

Not that I wanna
prolong your sermon,

but how is it blasphemy
to remind a guy

he's the son of God?

Maybe the bad thief thought

Jesus had a <i>Bourne
Identity</i> thing going on,

like Jesus fell off a boat,

hit his head and caught amnesia.

He was born in a manger.

Now he's Bourne again.

Matt Damon is Jesus Bourne in...

The Bourne Nativity.

Heavenly Father, I beseech thee,

please smite
this braying heretic.

(BREATHES HEAVILY) Oh.

Are you okay?

No, something's wrong, I...
I can't catch my breath.

Stop teasing me.

I'm not teasing, I...

I can't catch my breath, man.

Really? Should I try
mouth stuff?

What is this, a Tinder
date? Get off of me.

You said you can't breathe.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)
I can breathe. I just...

I can't catch my breath.

What are you doing
with your arm?

I'm trying to breathe.

You're really sweating, Randal.

It's hot in here, man.

Can we open the door?
I got to...

Mr. Dante!

Oh, shit!

I need an ambulance
at the Quick Stop.

(SIREN BLARING)

WOMAN: (OVER PA SYSTEM)
<i>Dr. Ladenheim,</i>

<i>report to the ER.</i>

<i>Dr. Ladenheim...</i>

You had to call an
ambulance, didn't you?

I just ate too much
fuckin' Mooby's, that's all.

Well, if you know what's wrong,

then I guess I can go home.

Are you the doctor?

I'm the doctor.

Dr. Ladenheim, I'll be
your savior this evening.


What in the fuck?

I apologize for my wardrobe.

I just came from a costume ball.

Listen, Doc,
I'm okay. I just...

I can't catch my breath is all.

On a scale of one to ten,

how bad would you say
your pain level is?

RANDAL:
My pain level?

Like a negative three.

Well, you're doing it all wrong.

You're supposed to be
in a lot of pain

when you have a heart attack.

Wait a minute.
I had a heart attack?

No, that's not what I said.

You misunderstood me.
Oh, thank Christ.

You're having a heart attack

right now as we speak,

a massive one, so we
have to act pretty quickly.

I just wish I wasn't
so hung over.

I'm kidding.

I'm gonna go get all glammed up

for our big date and
I'll see you in the OR.

Look at me.
Uh-huh.

Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

Good. All right.

He's not gonna make it.

Jesus, could someone
page the <i>Good Witch?</i>

What's next, a fucking Munchkin?

(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Shave and a haircut two bits.

Shave and a haircut two bits.

(IN NORMAL VOICE) I see
that you met Dr. Ladenheim.

And she wants me to
prep you for surgery.

Surgery? No. The doctor
just said I'm going to the OR.

Right! Which is short
for operating room

where they do... Ding,
ding, ding, surgery!

She gotta get into your heart.

Uh, is the doctor gonna
crack his chest open?

Fuck.
No, no, no.

She's gonna thread a camera
through his femoral artery

up to his ticker through
a very small incision.

Where does
she make this incision?

In the groin.

The groin?
Come on.

So I gotta shave you.
(ELECTRIC SHAVER BUZZING)

Or I get to shave you,

depending on how much you
love your job and I love mine.

So, as the wife says at
10:00 p.m. after <i>Dateline,</i>

every single week,

take off your pants.

(ELECTRIC SHAVER BUZZING)


I gotta shave your groin,
sir, so underwear too.

First, can we
establish geography?

Like, where is the groin to you?

Where's the groin to me?

What is this,
a metaphysical question?

We're running out of
time here to save your life.

So come on, let's go.

(ELECTRIC SHAVER BUZZING)

Can you avert your
eyes, block your ears

and sing something, please?

Oh, for God sakes. What
do you want me to sing?

Not you, him.
Oh, right.

All right, here's the deal,

<i>Nurse Jackie.</i>
(DANTE HUMMING)

Mmm.

I got a really small dick, okay?

I promise you, it's
nothing I've not seen before

because I work in pediatrics.
(DANTE HUMMING)

If I take off my underwear,

everyone in the ER is
gonna see my little dick

including my friend here,

who thinks I got a giant cock
'cause I've been lying to him

about it since we
were 12. (GRUNTS)

Is this a long fable, Aesop?

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,

give you a little
more privacy...

There you go.
Oh, thanks for that.

Unfortunately, this is
as far as you can go

but we do have a waiting
room that's right down this hall.

I'll be right here
when you get out, man.

You got this.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>â™ª You got an idea
We can rock the night</i>

PARAMEDIC: We've
got a female with multiple

C-spine complications,
internal bleeding

and multiple lacerations.

Blood pressure,
100 over seven...

<i>â™ª Let's both make a promise
That we can't say... â™ª</i>

ER NURSE: We're
losing her. Starting CPR.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT)

DR. LADENHEIM: (GASPS)
Why has he still

got his underpants on?

How am I supposed to
get to his femoral artery

if he's wearing Squeezies?

MALE NURSE:

but he's got some
body shame issues.

(DR. LADENHEIM SIGHS)
Look, Doc,

I got a really small dick.

I'm trying to save your life

and you're worried
about your little dick?

We don't have time for this.

Whoa!


No, it is not, Elias.

I prayed to God to smite Randal

so Jesus attacked his
heart at my command.


Randal's mother
had heart trouble, too.

make Jesus reverse this.

Pray with me,
Mr. Dante.

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

Oh, my sweet savior,
hear your gentle servant.

Spare the heretic
I damned in jest.

Remember the words
of the good thief.

Jesus did no wrong,

whereas we are but thieves.

DR. LADENHEIM: A-ha.
What's up, Doc?

I can tell by your
very subtle tattoo

that you're a superhero fan,

so you might appreciate this.

Uh-huh.
You know,

they have a name for the type

of heart attack you're
having right now.

Really? Okay.

They call it the Widow-Maker.

Now, doesn't that
sound like some bad guy

that <i>Ranger Danger</i> has
to fight? (CHUCKLES)

Why do they call it
the Widow-Maker?

Because in 80% of the cases

when there's 100% occlusion
like what you have now?

Hands down, patient
always dies, always.

Oh, fuck.

But don't worry, you're
gonna be in the 20%

because keeping you
alive is good for my brand.

Now, if you excuse me,

I'm gonna go fool around
in your little crotch

and I'm gonna make
a little magic,

but I could use all the
help that we can get.

So, if you remember any prayers

from when you were a kid,

now would be a terrific
time to dust those off.

(RANDAL GROANS SOFTLY)

Are you there, Crom?

It's me, Randal.

(ECHOES SLIGHTLY)
<i>Please don't let me die.</i>

He won't answer me.

After all this time...

devoting my life to God.

Jesus has abandoned
all of us at Quick Stop.

I think Jesus was always
more of a Wawa guy.

you know what I think?

I think I wasted my
life believing in bullshit.

I've been conned.

Fairy tales, faith
and pledging fealty

to a fictional fucking
phantom. And for what?

In my darkest hour
when I need him most,

the Lord totally ghosts me.

Well, to hell with all
that made up Jesus jive.

(NECKLACE CLATTERS)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Save Randal this night,

and I will swear my soul to you,

oh, sweet Satan.

Satan? Oh,
buddy, no.

I mean, isn't he kind of like
the Optimus Prime of evil?

You don't have to
condescend to me.

You can just say Megatron.

I'm kind of
a <i>Transformers</i> virgin.


I'm an actual virgin,

so I know Satan's
gonna want my soul.

For what?
Evil.

And butt sex probably.

Do you have any lube?
Are you...

No!


Take me, Satan!

Jesus! Pull up
your pants.

Make me your concubine! Jesus...

Pull up your pants.
No, stop it.

I have to fuck Satan.

And that's when, I shit you not,

Luke fuckin' Skywalker shows up.

DR. LADENHEIM: Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about

the young, fuckable Luke
from <i>Return of the Jedi,</i>

not the <i>Gran Torino,</i>
"Get off my lawn"

Luke from <i>The Last Jedi.</i>
DR. LADENHEIM: Okay.

Quick heart update,
Mr. Graves.

Uh-huh.
During your thorough

retelling of
<i>The Star Wars Show...</i>

<i>The Mandalorian,</i> season two.

...I was able to get
the stent in place.

So this is where
I need your help now.

I'm gonna open this stent
and all you have to do

is tell me when you feel

the pressure lets up.
All right?

Let's do this, McDreamy.

"This is The Way."

The way to what?

Oh, that's a saying
from <i>The Mandalorian.</i>

Huh?
<i>The Star Wars Show.</i>

Okay, listen,
we need to hit pause

on all your pop culture
references for a minute

just until we open
the stent on three.

One, two, three!

Oh!

Holy shit, I can
fucking breathe again.

Does this mean
I'm gonna live now?

Yes, because
I'm an amazing doctor.

You're a better doctor
than Doctor Strange

and Doctor Zaius
combined. Doctor who?

Oh, no, I don't watch that show,

but I might start now
because I'm fucking alive.


<i>"Mazel tov!"</i>
As the Chinese say.

Thank you, Doctor.

Thank you for saving my life.

You're like the Batman of
heart surgery. (CHUCKLES)

Yeah?

(SPEAKING GRUFFLY)
With great power

comes great responsibility.

What the fuck was that?

You're alive!
DANTE: You're alive!

Are you okay? If that
was a heart attack,

I'll take another one. That
shit was easy. (CHUCKLES)

Okay, you must be on
a lot of drugs right now.

No, they didn't give
me nothing in there.

I had to do the
whole thing sober.

He's high as a kite on fentanyl.

Kite imagery, very cool.

See, Randal,
kites are in the air.

Stop with the fucking kites.

DR. LADENHEIM: One
more thing, Mr. Graves,

since you were really
preoccupied about it,

so much so that you
wasted time and nearly died,

your penis is not that small.

It's not that big,
but it's not that small.

best news I heard all day.

(CHUCKLING WEAKLY)

DANTE: Is he gonna
be okay?

How do I help?

Well, if you care about him,

you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

The guy's got more cholesterol
in his arteries than blood.

Got it. From now on, I'm
only gonna order him food

off the vegan menu at Mooby's.

Him and you.
Me?

If you're around his age

and eat the same diet
as your friend,

you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

Will do.

But here's something
I want you to keep

an eye out for
as regards to Randal.

Okay.

Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

after they've had
a heart attack.

Now your friend might sound
or act differently now because

he's come face to face
with his own mortality.

So, for the next few months,

do whatever you can do

to help Randal
keep his spirits up.

All right?

Now, my bill is in the mail.

<i>(WHATEVER IT TAKES</i>
BY LISA DALBELLO PLAYING)

Judgy.

<i>â™ª Whatever it takes</i>

<i>â™ª I know I can make it</i>

<i>â™ª I know
I can make it through</i>

(SONG FADES)

I brought you a hat.

Yeah. Thanks.

I can't believe
you're still awake

after the day
you've been through.

Yeah, I can't sleep.

There was only a 20% chance

I was gonna make it out
of that OR alive tonight.

Hmm. Is that right?

I mean, I figure I got
a 50-50 chance of dying

any time I leave my apartment.

But today,

there was an 80% chance
everything for me

was just gonna stop.

There was an 80% chance

you and I were never gonna
talk about <i>Star Wars</i> again.

There was an 80% chance

I would never know
for a medical fact,

I got a normal-sized dick.

You always said it was huge.

I was gonna miss a lot of shit

if you didn't call
that ambulance today.

You saved my life, man.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Oh.

I wish I had a life
worth fucking saving.

DANTE:
Come on, man.

What are you talking about?

When I was lying there,

wondering if I was gonna die,

I saw the whole movie of
my life flash before my eyes.

You know what?

It sucked. (SCOFFS)

I always thought, hoped...

that my life was building
towards something.

Turns out it was
just the hospital.

What are you talking about?

We built our own business.

So I co-own a
convenience store. Big deal.

I never went anywhere
outside of Jersey.

I never fell in love like you.

If I'd have
dropped dead tonight,

only you and Elias would
remember I even existed.

I mean, look at me,
man, I'm almost 50.

I sit around and watch the same

stupid movies over and over.


The fuck is wrong with me?

I don't know.

You know so much
about all that stuff.

I always thought you could
have made a cool movie.

Holy shit.

You're right.

I could make
a pretty cool movie.

I've been watching
movies all my life,

I've seen all these
people tell their stories

and never once thought
about trying to tell mine.

Well, fuck that, man.

Since I almost died tonight,

now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

So, no more watching movies

because when
I get out of here...

I'm gonna make a movie!

(MACHINE BEEPING)

DANTE: A movie?

Don't you have to go to
film school or something?

It's like 75 G's a year
to go to NYU Film School.

And you know what those
kids pay all that money for?

I don't know.
To watch movies.

I worked in a video
store for 20 years

where I sat around and
watched movies all day, too.

So basically, I went
to my own film school.

Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

to Quentin Tarantino.

Oh, now you're
Quentin Tarantino?

I'm not saying I'm gonna
make a movie as good as him,

but I'm not good at sex either,

and that doesn't stop me
from trying to get laid.


DANTE: You wanna
shoot a movie here,

at the Quick Stop?

Yeah, I've seen convenience
stores in flicks before,

but I've never seen
an entire flick

set in a convenience store.

Because who would
wanna watch that?

I mean, it's my life and
I barely wanna live it.

This movie's meant
to memorialize my life.

And since I spent the last

30 years of my life
working here...

Oh. Working?

I got plenty of
convenience stories

to put into a screenplay.

<i>Convenience Stories.</i>
Good title.

Well, what kind of
convenience stories

are we talking about here?

the time we went to

Julie Dwyer's funeral and
you knocked the casket over?

You knocked the casket over.

I did?

Well, that's a scene now.

Or how about the time
the old guy was jerking off

in the bathroom
and dropped dead?

That's totally a scene, man.

I mean, all the shit
you and I have said

sitting at this counter,

these are all scenes now, man.

How about the time you
burned the store down?

Is that gonna be a scene?

I'm still pretty sure
terrorists did that.

Uh-huh.
(DOOR OPENS)

RANDAL: Hey, hey!

Motley Crewneck.

Anyone in your
Christian Crypto Club

got a non-crypto camera
we can borrow?

It's called the Crimson
Crypto Club now.

Our first drops gonna
be all crypto kites.

Oh, put that shit
away, Elon Muskrat.

What do you guys
need a camera for?

RANDAL: Mmm. Randal
wants to make a movie.

Ooh, like a pornography movie?

No, like a movie-movie,

one with actors and a screenplay

and Crafty. (LAUGHS)

What's Crafty?

That's where the,
uh, crew hangs out

and practices witchcraft,

you little devil worship per.

Cool.

Crafty is where you
find all the food on set.

But if you're shooting in here,

I guess the whole
store's Crafty.

What's the movie gonna be about?

Mmm, it's gonna be
about an hour and a half.

I hate long movies.

It's about him working
here. ELIAS: Wow.

Meta. Never seen
a whole movie

set in a convenience
store before.

Right? Thank you.

I'm gonna fill the script
with all the weird shit

me and Dante have ever said

or seen around here

over the years.
Oh.

You should put in that
stuff you used to say

about the Death Star
contractors.

by Disney? Fuck that.

Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

other movies. I want
it to be about me.

It's my flick,
so I wanna write about

the things that I do.

Like, um, like how we
play hockey on the rooftop.

I've never seen that done
in a movie or a TV show,

even though it's
just fucking practical.


where I hit you in the
face with the bread?

Ooh, that could be a scene.

Or the time I spit
water on that old guy?

That's, like, the
fucking opening scene.

Ooh, I got an idea.

Maybe Jay and Silent
Bob could be characters.

That is the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

DANTE: Well,
you're still gonna have

to get them involved
if you wanna set

any of the scenes
in your old video store.

All right. Watch
the register, dawg.

We got to go talk to
the Warner Brothers.

What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

Almost.
What happened

is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

when a rattlesnake came up

and bit me right on the asshole.

But like the good friend he is,

Dante sucked the poison out.

See? It happened
to them, too, man.

Well, listen, when we
thought you were dead, man,

I felt really, really bad

'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

in front of this
store and stuff,

I forgot to give you something.

<i>Dental School?</i>

Me and Veggie Dick
rented that shit in 1994,

but we never watched it

'cause we didn't have
a VCR. (CHUCKLES)

But now, you can
put it on the shelf

in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

Uh, the video store
closed ten years ago.

It did?

This was the video store.

Oh, yeah, I'm getting senile

and shit right there,
you know? (LAUGHS)

So listen, how much
we owe you for late fees?

see, a dollar a day for what,

26, 28 years?

That's, like,
approximately... $10,220.

Oh, didn't rewind.

$10,220 and 50 cents.

You take crypto?

You guys got crypto?

No.

If you never watched it,

why was it not rewound? Yeah.

Hey, asshole, I said
we didn't have a VCR.

We watched it. We
held it up to the light.

Fucking Luddite.

Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

on the 28-year-old copy
of <i>Dental School</i>

if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

Ooh, a pornography movie?

No, it's not a porno movie.

Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

'cause I am the Clit Commander!

Snootchie Bootchies.

Goodnight.

Thirty-seven?

That's not a scene, Randal.

Stop writing it right now.

Thirty-seven cannot go
in your movie.

fuck up. It's nighttime!

DANTE: <i>"In Convenience"?</i>

It's the story of my life.

Hundred and sixty-eight
pages full of dick jokes,

set in a convenience store,

written in one night.

Maybe don't tell
people that last part.

I thought, you were gonna
call it <i>"Convenience Stories."</i>

Yeah, that shit
sounded too precious.

What am I, Wes Anderson?

on this script.

"There is only one return

"and it ain't of the
King, it's of the Jedi."

Hmm.
ELIAS: Hey.

You said that same
thing about return

the day that guy
threw up in Mooby's

and you made me
clean it. RANDAL: Yeah.

Everything in the
script is something

either me or someone
I know said,

I just made up new names.

What am I, some kind of writer?

Ah, yes.

Block chain would
like to understand

why the two girls are
into this "Dan-T" character

when the Randy
character is much funnier.

Randy has been asking himself

the same question
his whole life.

What's wrong with
Dan-T? (SCOFFS)

Read his first scene on page 37.

DANTE: Are you
kidding me?

I'm in this convenience
store way more than you,

but I don't come into your

convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

I had a lot of exposition to do.


"A hideous fuckin' chud
of a man." What the fuck?

RANDAL: Well,
maybe Dan-T's not you.

Do you ever think of that?

"Dan-T's hideous
fuckin' chud of a beard

"doesn't suggest Tony Stark
so much as a male crack whore

"who is cosplaying
as Tony Stark."

That's just in the
screen direction.

Nobody actually calls Dan-T

"a hideous fuckin'
chud." To his face.

I can't believe you made me

sign a non-disclosure agreement,

only to read that I'm not even

one of the main characters
in the story of your life.

I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,

but I thought I was
at least the Han.

Oh, come on, I'm the Han

and the Luke, right? (SCOFFS)

Then who am I, the Chewie?

I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

Unless this is Empire
then I'm the Lando

and he's the Lobot.

I'm not even the Lobot?

Which one's Lobot?

He's the one with the
headphones who looks like

a dad who's trying to be a DJ.

The bald fucker from Be spin

who never says
nothing the whole movie.

Wouldn't that make
Silent Bob the Lobot?

No. Jay and Silent Bob are
clearly the C-3PO and R2-D2.

I mean, they've been
here since the first movie,

which was the last
time they were cool,

but they've been with
the franchise so long

they still give them cameos

and put them on the lunchboxes.

So if I'm not Luke,
Han, Chewie, Lando,

the droids or the Lobot,

then who the fuck
am I in your <i>Star Wars,</i>

Princess fucking Leia? No.

You're the Dak.

Who the fuck is Dak?

He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

in the Battle of Hoth.

You know, the guy who's ready

to take on the whole
Empire himself

until the Empire kills
the shit out of him?

even get an action figure?

Not in the classic
Kenner line, no.

Because?

Because he was deemed
unimportant to the story.

But that's just bullshit, man.

Without Dak, Luke
could have never...

Like, Dak was the
only guy that's, like, uh...

I mean, Dak was plucky
as shit, man, just like you.

Uh, I have a question
about the script.

Great, more fuckin' notes.

Go ahead.
ELIAS: Yes.

Uh, I have a problem with
the Friar Fuck character,

who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

Friar Fuck, uh, loves Jesus,

uh, to what appears to
be an unhealthy degree.

And?

And Elias is a born
again Satanist.

Because it was Satan
who saved you

when my prayers fell
on the deaf ears of Jesus,

the giant jerk off.

All right, listen
up, Friar Fuck.

I get that you just broke up

with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

and clearly you're going
through some couture

and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

But for the first 36
years of your life,

you were into Jesus
to an unhealthy degree,

and that's the Elias that
I based Friar Fuck on.

Then this script
is based on lies.

Welcome to the movie biz.

There's no truth in this art!

Jesus.

Everyone's a critic.

So, what do we do next?

What are you asking Dak for?

Well, I can't do this alone.
I need a producer.

That's your job.
Me?

What do I know about producing?

Come on. I'm already
writing and directing.

I can't do everything, man.

All right. What does
a producer do?

Just build us a schedule,
keep us under budget,

secure a DP,
and most importantly,

find us financing.

What, I gotta get money, too?

How much are we
talking about here?

Mmm, 25 grand.

$25,000?

Well, technically, it's $27,575

but it would be way more
if we were in Canada.

Where the fuck
am I supposed to find

that kind of money from?

We can find that kind of cash.

What? How?

We launch our crypto
kite NFTs next month.

<i>So the Crimson Crypto Club</i>

<i>could have a lot
of money to invest</i>

if the crypto kites fly.

RANDAL: Again
with the fucking kites.

Guys, we need real loot
to make a real movie,

not your make pretend
<i>Matrix</i> money,

you fuckin' kite fucker.

I'm sick and tired of the kite
killing attitude around here.


(DOOR OPENS)

RANDAL: Anyway,
back to the budget.

What if we took out a
loan against the store?

A loan?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we just

slow down a minute
and think about this first?

Slow down?
I almost died, man.

It doesn't get
any slower than that.

I'm not getting all
"Dante" about this.

Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

You're the guy
who can never decide

whether to shit
or get off the pot.

Well, I don't have
time for that anymore.

From now on,
I'm gonna shit bricks

or what's the point
of being here?

So, come on, man,

get behind me
when I shit for once.

So I can what, wipe your ass?


You know, I don't wanna get
all "Dante" about this,

but find someone else
to take your shit.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

BECKY: Well,
well, well, here he is.

The escape artist.

<i>I Sit on Your Grave.</i>

that movie at the video store?

<i>I Spit on Your Grave.</i>

Hicks, you spit on
my grave in a dream,

you better wake up
and apologize.

Ah...

So this is a dream.
Uh, if it is,

then you need to learn
to dream bigger.

I mean, really,

this is the best
that you can do?

A cemetery?

You can't dream us into sex...

on the beach...

in Hawaii?

Like you'd wanna
have sex with me now.

I'm an old man.

I'll have you know
that being dead only

increases your sex drive.


The dead live to fuck.

So you have sex
in the afterlife?

Hell's yeah.

There's nothing to do
in Heaven except fuck.

what makes it Heaven.

I can't believe my wife's
having sex with dead people.

Famous dead people.

I'm on the celebrity
circuit now.

Bullshit. Name one famous
person you fucked in Heaven.

One. Okay.
(SMACKS LIPS)

I have knocked boots with
the ghost of Cleopatra, sir.

Oh.
And Miles Davis

and Frederick
Douglass, together.

George Washington...
What?

Carver.
Oh.

You know how much
I love peanut butter.

True.
Who else?

Um, Carl Sagan.

Oh!
A real thinker.

Um...

Malcolm X.

Malcolm triple X.
Oh, settle down.

And I'm sure you're letting
them all go ass to mouth.

Uh, yeah, they're famous.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

You think I want
this, don't you?

You carrying the torch for me?

I told you how I feel
about romantic love, Hicks.

Oh, I remember.

You were very convincing. Mmm.

Right up until the day
I proposed.

We only knew each other
for, like, 15 minutes.

You've been mourning me
for, like, 15 years.

So what do you want me to do?

You want me to just
forget about you?

You were all
I ever dreamed about.

Both of you.

(BECKY SIGHS)

God, I'm so alone.



I know losing me and Grace...

broke you.

But you don't know
how lucky you have it.

What?

The Book of Life is
closed for the two of us.

But you... can still
turn a page.

You get to keep writing
the story of your life.

Why bother without you?

Because there are
more tales to tell, Hicks.

As long as you're alive,

you can always
start another chapter.

So live while you can,
love while you can.

God damn it.

Dream bigger.


That all sounds pretty romantic

coming from a girl who
doesn't believe in romantic love.

I don't believe
in romantic love.

That's my girl.

But I do believe in you.

(BECKY CHUCKLES)


(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, I wanna thank you
guys for having me here today.

I've always wanted

Nice.

I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

I'm not even supposed

I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

I'm not even supposed to
be here today. (SOBBING)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

supposed to be here today.

I'm not even supposed

Oh, shit! I thought
that was the police.

I'm not even supposed

By the power of Gray skull,

I am not supposed

Hey, I'm Joe.

Uh, I'm 45-years-old,

and I figured I'd give
this shit a go. Uh...

I am not even supposed

Damn right.

I'm known professionally
as Boston John.

That's a <i>nom de plume.</i>

Uh, Robert De Niro is
my fuckin'... Lone star.

You know what I'm saying?
Close your eyes. Just...

Close your eyes. Just
listen. Ready? All right?

(MIMICKING ROBERT DE NIRO)
I have nipples, Greg.

Could you milk me?

Fuck, that is one,
bitch. All day.

Can you give me one
like Schwarzenegger?

(MIMICS ARNOLD) I'm not
even supposed to be here today.

But can you, uh,
Pacino that shit?

(MIMICS AL PACINO)
Ooh-ah!


When will I see
the God damn sailboat?

That came from a real
deep personal place.

I have a BFA.

Uh, I'm a theater
background actor.

As an actor with
a theater background,

I was classically
trained in New York.

Have you actually thought

about going musical with
this? 'Cause it could be...

<i>â™ª I'm not even...</i>

Supposed to be here.

<i>â™ª Today â™ª</i>

Hah, hoo, hah.
Yeah-cha!

Kick ball change and
snap, snap, jazz hands.

That is beautiful, man.

Freddie Prinze Jr.

"I'll fuck anything

Wait, wait a minute, man,
is this a porno?

I'll fuck anything that moves.

I'll fuck anything that moves.

I'll fuck anything that moves.

That's a little bit
in your face.

Let me try it
like this, hold on.

Can I borrow your underpants
for about ten minutes?

I'll fuck anything that moves.

And, fool,

I always carry a machete.

I'll fuck anything that moves!

Sounds like the guy
I buy weed from.

You know what this movie needs?

Deez. Deez nuts!

Can I just offer you
a piece of advice?

You know what this
script needs right here?

Like an old lady
that says curse words.

Holy shit.

Who wrote this garbage? His
mother should be ashamed.


The fuck?

He's auditioning
for Silent Bill.


I don't know if you know
<i>Sound of Music,</i>

the marionettes were
the best part of that.

I think that's why
they won Oscars.

It's worth thinking about

maybe doing the whole
movie with marionettes.

(ROCK MUSIC FADES)

Take your heart pills, Tin Man.

Hey.

So, how's it going
with the financing?

You raise my money, yet?

If it's your money,

then how come
I have to raise it?

That's Hollywood.

Did you finish
reading the script?

Last night.

And? It's funny,
right?

It's funny,

but it was like my entire
life flashed before my eyes.

My life flashed
before your eyes.

I was glad you left
some stuff out.

So, uh...

which one of these guys
gets to play me?

Well, the guys are too young

and hot to play you.
What the fuck?

And nobody's nearly
funny enough to play me.

So then, what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna play my part myself.

(ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

All right, already,
we're closing. Gee whiz!

Why? You're highly
offending me!

Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Jesus.

I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closed.

It's me, Randal.

Huh. Cool. <i>Blade
Runner,</i> I like that.

Thanks. What's
a <i>Blade Runner?</i>

Can we get back to you
acting in a movie

that you're directing even
though you've never acted in

or directed a movie before?

It worked for Orson Welles.


Neither was Howard Stern,

but he acted in the
movie about his life.

call that acting.

You think you can do better?

Better than Howard Stern
did in <i>Private Parts?</i>

It's not a high bar.

Great, because
you're playing Dan-T.

What? No, no, no.
I'm not. I can't act.

You're as good
as any of the jokers

we saw at 1the audition.

Besides, if I'm gonna
play me, you gotta play you.

You have to do this, Mr. Dan-T.

DANTE: Oh,
for God's sakes,

please stop calling me
Mr. Dan-T.

That's another thing.
Fuck all the fake names.

What is this shit, <i>Mad Magazine?</i>

Randal is playing Randal.

Dante is playing Dante,
aka Mr. Dante,

and Elias is playing Elias.

ELIAS: I'm in
the movie, too?

Yup. And as a Satanist
playing a Christian,

you've gotta act the most.

It's my very own chance...

to transform.

And transform you
shall, Bumblebee.

Soon as Mr. Dante
secures our fuckin' financing.

Yo, it's too bad you didn't
marry that Emma chick,

the one with the big clit.

Wasn't she like some kinda
car wash heiress or something?

DANTE: Can you focus?

Even if we do play ourselves,

you still got to cast
all the customer parts.

Why am I casting customers
to say all this stupid shit

when I still see
the real customers

who said all the stupid
shit in the first place

come in here every day?
They can do it.

Oh, my God, you can't just turn

regular people into movie stars.

No inch, no inch, no inch!
Smokin' weed.

Smokin' weed!

Pack of wraps, my good man.

Time to kick back,
drink some beers

and smoke some weed.

You own a whole weed store.

Hey, Randal, I've got an idea.

What if Jay and Bob
play Jay and Bob?

Well, we can
ask 'em. Yo.

Yo use guys want to
be in my movie?

Ooh, a pornography movie?

RANDAL: It's not
a porno movie.

It's the movie we're
shooting in your store.

You still ain't done?

We haven't even started yet.

I don't know. Who would
we be playing in this movie?

Well, it's these two
characters I kind of based

on you and Maggie Simpson here.

Check out your first scene.

DANTE: These guys
aren't real actors.

But they are real fucked
up and I could work with that.

This doesn't sound
like me at all.

What are you talking about?

All the shit in there
is all the stuff

I've personally heard
you say around here.

I do not talk like this, man.

Why do you have me
saying stupid shit like

"Snootchie Bootchies"
all the time?

RANDAL: I'll tell
you what.

If you guys play
yourselves in the movie,

I'll let you guys be in
charge of Crafty, too.

So what's Crafty about?

Well, in addition to being
the comic relief in the movie,

you'd also be in charge
of all the food on set.

Ooh, we learned about food prep

back when we ran
the fucking Cock Smoker.

Wasn't that place
just a drug front?

had drugs in the front

and drugs in the back.

DANTE: So if Elias
is playing Elias

and these dopes
are playing themselves,

who are you gonna get
to play Veronica?

Well, funny you should ask,

'cause earlier today
I sent the script

to someone who
will be absolutely...

(CLICKS TONGUE)
...perfect to play Veronica.

(DOOR OPENS)

Who the fuck do you
people think you are?

Veronica?
What is this filth?

What is this gamey, tawdry trash

that makes me out to be
some slutty sex maniac?

RANDAL: It's just
a movie I'm making

about my life, and I thought

it'd be fun for you
to play yourself in it.

Oh, you did?

Yeah.

Then you are fucking sick! Hey!

Watch it with
my artistic expression.

"Artistic expression"?
That's my life.

It's my life.

Okay, everybody,
calm down. Jeez.

DANTE: Oh, come on,
you would have killed

to have been
in a film in college.

You majored in drama.

I minored in drama.

I majored in oral surgery.

All hail the queen of oral.

Fuck you.
Surgery.

You didn't let me finish.

And I'm not gonna let you
finish this film either,

not with me as a character.

I'm not some fucking
joke you get to tell

in your dirty little B movie,

you two-bit
strip mall Soderbergh.

I see myself more like
retail's Richard Linklater.

VERONICA: You want
to do this?

Fine, but leave me out of it.

Unlike either of you,
I've got a grown-up job.

And unlike either of you,
I've got a family.

Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

I... Sorry.


(DANTE SIGHS)

Please don't cry.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)
It's just been a shit day.


I had two cancelations.

My ex calls to tell me that

he's not putting
our daughter's car

on his insurance,

and so now somehow
she's pissed at me.

And then I see you
and say that shit.

It's okay. Really.

I kinda feel like... I feel
like such an asshole.

Hey, Ronnie.

If Randal told me he was
gonna send you the script,

I would've said no way.

But now, I'm glad he did.

Because it's...

it's really nice to see you.
Even under the circumstances.

And you look great.

You look way younger than I do.

Yeah?
Yeah.

How young you think I look?

You don't look a day over...

37.

So, um...

Perfect. We don't want

we're ready to shoot.

So you're gonna have
to hold him all day.

But I'm allergic to cats.

You got to suffer
for your art, man.

But it's not my art,
it's your art.

Shouldn't you be the

(CLEARS THROAT)
Silent Bob,

you are a rrr-rude motherfucker!

But you're cute as hell.

Very natural,
and subtle. I like it.

So, how are you feeling today?

Oh, you know,
I feel like that kid

that worked in the video store,

fully fluent in
the language of cinema.

It's like I was born to direct.

No, bro. I mean, you had
a heart attack last month.

Oh, that.
No, I feel fine.

How do you feel today

after your Range Rover
sleepover last night?

Stop it. When I said
to be a producer,

I didn't mean produce
a late-in-life child.

Unwilling producer.

I didn't ask for this
job, but I am doing it.

So I have a meeting
today about money.

Fucking A,
that's producing, J.J.

And I found you
a cinematographer.

What?
May I present to you...

Shooter Bob.

Silent Bob is gonna be our DP?

Shit, yeah, we all
gonna be doing DPs!

Uh, DP is the name of the job.

You said it was cinematographer.

The cinematographer is the DP.

Man, don't be
acting like you know

all the industry slang and shit.

Me and Silent Bob
are the only ones here

who've actually been
on a movie set. Twice.

(RANDAL SCOFFS)

RANDAL: Come on.

Yes, he's an
unconventional choice,

but you are an unconventional
filmmaker making

an unconventional film.
Yeah.

You want me to entrust the
story of my life to the <i>Quiet Place.</i>

He has some really nice shots

on his Instagram.

Come on, give him a chance, man.

Maybe he speaks the
language of cinema like you do.

The guy never speaks at all.

Okay, so we just
scouted in here,

and the colors are fucking ugly.

So Silent Bob wants to
shoot the whole movie

in black and white.

<i>Schindler's List</i> black and
white? What, is he nuts?

Uh, no, I'm a fucking filmmaker.

And any filmmaker
worth their salt

would know that the colors

in this place
are fucking ghastly.

The only way you
could deal with them

is to neutralize them by
going in black and white,

which will also kind
of act as a commentary

on the soulless
nature of commerce

while subliminally giving
the audience the impression

that they're watching our heroes

from the perspective

of an imaginary
store security cam.

That's what I was
thinking. Mmm-hmm.

That's what an

But, you know, it's up to you.

Hi, you.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

How's Florida?

<i>Full of assholes, but
at least it's not Jersey.</i>

<i>What do you want, Dante?</i>

Okay, uh, this is gonna
come out of left field,

but, um, I was hoping
I could borrow some money.

<i>Fuck no.</i>

It's not for me.
It's for Randal.

<i>Oh, then double fuck no.</i>

He had a heart attack, Emma.

<i>Good. I hope
he dropped dead.</i>

He didn't.

So he needs the money for, uh...

for the hospital bills.

Randal doesn't have
any insurance.

<i>So the fuck what?</i>

<i>Even if I wanted to help,
which I don't,</i>

<i>I'm not giving Randal
Graves any free money.</i>

Emma, please.

You and I once promised
that if we ever needed help,

we'd always be there for
each other, no matter what.

<i>That was before
you cheated on me</i>

<i>at a fucking donkey show.</i>

<i>Goodbye, Dante!</i>

No, no. Wait, wait,
wait. (GROANS)

Please, Emma.

I'm desperate here.

<i>Do you even have any collateral?</i>

If I have to...

I can sign over my half of
the Quick Stop as collateral.

<i>That shithole? Ugh.</i>

What's all this about?
We're making a movie.

No shit.
A pornography movie?

How long does that

No way. I'm not letting you

A sequel?
What am I? A hack?

Cohee, producer says I
gotta cut your scene, man.

Yo, I'm still pay

Publicity? Isn't it
a little early for that?

I've been reading the
paper my whole life

and the only time
I've seen my name in it

was under the headline,

"Local grocer has
massive heart attack."

So I thought in your
official capacity as producer,

maybe you can get a
cub reporter over here

to do a story about
your director in action.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

JAY: "I assure you
we're open."

I don't get it.

Some savages are always
sticking gum in the locks,

the shutters are closed all day.

That way, we can shoot at night

RANDAL:
"Han gets frozen

"and taken away

I said that.

No, you said, "Han gets frozen,

"taken away

You left out
the "and."

Do I come in now, Randal?

Not yet, Thomas.
Go back out.

You can blame Dante for
ad-libbing all over my movie

like he's Seth fucking Rogan.

Oh, my God, I left out one word.

Every word is sacred

DANTE: This

It's a bunch of shit that
happened for real in my life.

Do I come in now, Randal?

Not yet, Thomas.

Here, Chewlies gum, try this.

What is that?

What happened to the

No.

You know what?

Cut, cut, cut! I can't
abide by this racist shit.

Racist? How the
hell is it racist?

Just look at all this
fucking lack of diversity.

And calling some guy
an Asian design major

just feels racist.

That's not racist. The guy
literally majored in Asian design.

Are you sure?

Wasn't he a, uh, Asian student
who was also a design major?

He was a passionate
student of Asian design.

It just so happens he himself
was coincidentally Asian.

honest with you?
Oh, please,

be completely honest.


You think you deserve a movie?

Yeah.

do in life but watch it

and mock it?

What have you ever fucking done?

I had a life.

I was this close
to happily ever after

and then, one drunk
driver later...

my movie's over.

Forever.

No happy ending,

no sequel.

just, "Fuck you!
And, oh, by the way,

"fuck you!" Credits.

But, hey...

What's that compared
to a heart attack?

I mean, shit!

You could have
almost died, right?

Yeah.

Well, some of us did die.

Some of us have been
dead inside ever since.

But then, just when I'm
able to walk into this place

without wanting to kill myself
every day, you have an idea.

You wanna make a movie
about your life.

Oh, and you... you've
been very clear about that.

It's your life!

Well, get this,
you self-centered,

gaping wound of a human being

with your insatiable
fucking ego!


Your life...

is my life!

I've been there with
you the whole time!

And since you know how
hard that life's been on me,

did it ever occur to you

that maybe I didn't wanna
relive that fucking life?

<i>â™ª Nothing you would take</i>

<i>â™ª Everything you gave</i>

<i>â™ª Hold me 'til I die</i>

<i>â™ª Meet you on the other side</i>

RANDAL: Come on in here,
you little butt thief,

and assume your new position.

But this was
Mr. Dante's spot.

Yeah, well, after all this time

of being my biggest
and only fanboy,

I'd say you earned it.

Besides, I told you way back
when we worked at Mooby's

when Dante is gone,

you're gonna be
my new best friend.


No, I'm not.

Who the fuck else am
I gonna hang out with?

It's you and me, buddy.

Oh, fuck.

Well, look who it is,
Mr. Big Shit.

Well, look who it is,
Mrs. Big Clit.

Classy. How am
I not surprised?

I was surprised to see
you at the cemetery.

You flew up for Dante?

Well, I did almost marry
the man, and if I had... P.S.

He wouldn't have died
of a heart attack

before he was 50.

Yeah, because
after a year with you,

he'd have killed himself.

I think I heard
you had a heart attack.

Am I right?

That must really fuck with you.

Dante's dead but
you're still here.

I guess it's true
what they say, Randal.

Only the good die young.

To what do I owe the pleasure

of your entirely
unwelcome visit?

I loaned Dante 30 grand

and he put his half of
the store up as collateral.

Now he's gone.

And if you can't pay me
back, I own half this shithole.


How big's my clit
now, motherfucker?

Oh, my sweet Satan,

lend your might to the
meek and deliver us

from this succubus.

What the...

The kites are flying!
Ah!

I repeat!
The kites are...

flying!
He talks?

Yes.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
What?

The kites are sold out.

The fucking kites,
God, the kites.

The Crimson Kite NFT's,

<i>the ones we minted for
the Crimson Crypto Club.</i>

Block chain put them
on sale last night

and they all sold out.

So?

The two of us just made...

One million!
One million!

One million dollars!
Ah!

Hail Satan! I'm
crypto rich, bitch!

I just cashed out $100,000
just to flex and buy sex.

Here, take that.
Shit.

What're you gonna do
with your money, Big E?

I'll never be able to earn
my place behind this counter

but now I can buy it.
Here's your sucking

blood money.
Oh!

Now, get the hell
out of our store!

Well played, clerks.

ELIAS: Sorry about
the mess.

That was from <i>Star Wars.</i>

I only said it 'cause
you and Mr. Dante

used to talk about
<i>Star Wars.</i> I know.

Long time ago.

In a galaxy far, far
away... (DOOR OPENS)

Holy fuck, that's
a lot of money.

You wanna buy some weed?

Yes! I wanna buy
all the weed!

Here's ten grand.

Whoo! That's gonna
get you higher

than Godzilla's asshole.

Yo, where those kites at?

Right this way, valued customer.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Aye-yi-yi.


<i>(I'M FROM NEW JERSEY</i>
BY JOHN GORKA PLAYING)


I wish you were here, man.

<i>â™ª I'm from New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª I don't expect too much</i>

<i>â™ª If the world ended today</i>

<i>â™ª I would adjust</i>

<i>â™ª I'm from New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª No, I don't talk that way</i>

<i>â™ª I watched too much TV</i>

<i>â™ª When I was young</i>

<i>â™ª There are girls
From New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª Who have
That great big hair</i>

<i>â™ª They're found
In shopping malls</i>

<i>â™ª I will take you there</i>

<i>â™ª I'm from New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª It's not like Texas</i>

<i>â™ª There is no mystery</i>

<i>â™ª I can't pretend</i>

<i>â™ª I'm from New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª It's like Ohio</i>

<i>â™ª But even more so</i>

<i>â™ª Imagine that</i>

<i>â™ª I know which exit</i>

<i>â™ª And where I'm bound</i>

<i>â™ª The tolls on the parkway</i>

<i>â™ª They will slow you down</i>

<i>â™ª New Jersey people</i>

<i>â™ª They will surprise you</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause they're not expected</i>

<i>â™ª To do too much</i>

<i>â™ª They will try harder</i>

<i>â™ª They may go further</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause they never think</i>

<i>â™ª That they are good enough</i>

<i>â™ª I'm from New Jersey</i>

<i>â™ª I don't expect too much</i>

<i>â™ª If the world ended today</i>

<i>â™ª I would adjust</i>

<i>â™ª I would adjust</i>

<i>â™ª I would adjust â™ª</i>

(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL
ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Hey, kids!
It's me, Kevin Smith,</i>

<i>and I can't thank you enough
for making this third trip</i>

<i>to the convenience store
with me. Thank you.</i>

<i>Um... This time's
exciting for me</i>

<i>because this time everyone</i>
<i>finally gets to see</i> Clerks

<i>the way I've always seen</i> Clerks.

<i>Most people think that</i> Clerks
<i>is a black and white movie</i>

<i>and they're right. It was
shot on black and white film.</i>

<i>But, to me,</i>
<i>whenever I watch</i> Clerks,

<i>even though
it's in black and white,</i>

<i>the movie appears in color.</i>

<i>Because I lived that life.</i>

<i>And so now, thanks to Lee Ron,</i>

<i>you're all seein' Quick Stop
and the surrounding area,</i>

<i>uh, Dante, Randal,
Jay and Silent Bob</i>

<i>as I've always seen them
from day one.</i>

<i>Um, in vivid, living color.</i>

<i>Uh, you know, Quick Stop
is the unsung, uh, star</i>

<i>of all the</i> Clerks <i>movies,</i>
<i>if not,</i>

<i>you know, the epicenter</i>

<i>of the View Askewniverse
films in general.</i>

<i>Um, all stories emanate</i>

<i>and flow from that
little building.</i>

<i>And when I worked there...</i>

<i>um, I hated it.
I didn't want to be there.</i>

<i>I didn't wanna work
for somebody else</i>

<i>and I didn't wanna work there.</i>

<i>And people would come in</i>

<i>and I'd be like, "Oh, my God,</i>

<i>"I have to actually
wait on people?</i>

<i>"I just wanna watch TV."</i>

<i>I didn't even wanna work
at the convenience store.</i>

<i>I tried to get a job
at RST Video.</i>

<i>There was an ad
in the paper for it.</i>

<i>I went down
and talked to Mr. Topper.</i>

<i>He said... He goes,
"I see you have</i>

<i>"convenience store
experience as well."</i>

<i>I said, "Yeah, I worked in a
bunch of convenience stores."</i>

<i>And he goes, "Would
you be willing to work</i>

<i>"in this convenience
store next door</i>

<i>"from time to time because
we own that as well?"</i>

<i>And I was like, "Uh, yeah,
if you need help."</i>

<i>And, uh, famous last
words because it...</i>

<i>it was a convenience store job.</i>

<i>He catfished me.
I just wound up</i>

<i>working in a convenience store
with a couple of hours in...</i>

<i>in a video store,
teased with paradise,</i>

<i>then seduced and abandoned
to sell, uh, goods.</i>

<i>So in</i> Clerks, <i>Randal says,</i>

<i>"Man, this job would be great</i>

<i>"if it wasn't for
the fuckin' customers."</i>

<i>Uh, but in the script</i>
<i>for</i> Clerks III,

<i>I'm gonna read you a little
something that was there</i>

<i>that I didn't use in the movie.</i>

<i>During the pullback shot</i>

<i>at the very end,
you hear John Gorka's</i>

<i>beautiful</i> I'm From New Jersey.

<i>And it was so lovely,</i>

<i>I left that moment alone
and didn't put in</i>

<i>what in the script called
for, the voice of Smod.</i>

<i>That would be me. And this
is what you would have heard.</i>

<i>"Randal Graves spent
the rest of his life</i>

<i>"running Quick Stop Groceries</i>

<i>"whenever he wasn't
making movies,</i>

<i>"with each film financed solely</i>

<i>"by Crimson Crypto Studios.</i>

<i>"At a screening
of his final film,</i>

<i>"the</i> As bury Park Press
<i>asked him</i>

<i>"to sum up
a life spent satisfying</i>

<i>"both the public's demand
for cigarettes and soda</i>

<i>"as well as their appetite
for the many movies</i>

<i>"he made after his
celebrated debut,</i> Clerk.

<i>"The 90-year-old
Randal Graves replied,</i>

<i>"'I always thought that jobs
would have been great</i>

<i>"'if it weren't for
the fuckin' customers.</i>

<i>"'But as it turns out,</i>

<i>"'these jobs are great because
of the fuckin' customers.'"</i>

<i>He means it and so do I.</i>

<i>Thank you to everybody</i>

<i>whoever walked through
the door of that store</i>

<i>and made me think,</i>

<i>"Somebody should put this
in a fuckin' movie."</i>

<i>Somebody did. Thank you.</i>

JAY: <i>Yeah!</i>
