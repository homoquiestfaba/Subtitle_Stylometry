00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.490
Yeah, I know.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.860
The guy's really good.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.550
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.330
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.130
Hey, and speaking of problems...

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.690
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.030
with your T.P.S. reports?

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.440
SAMIR:
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.660
TOM: Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.290
SAMIR: ls that Smykowski?

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.360
-Samir!
-What's he doing?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.100
MICHAEL: Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.970
TOM: I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.770
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.500
PETER: What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.100
TOM: So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.840
They're gonna downsize lnitech.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.110
SAMIR: What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.380
TOM: How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.540
That's how I know.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.350
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.250
It happened
at lnitrode last year.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.090
You have to interview
with this consultant.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.890
They call them
efficiency experts...

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.120
but what you're really doing...

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.560
is interviewing
for your own job.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.960
MICHAEL: Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.230
and you're still here.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.700
TOM: Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.900
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.030
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.440
SAMIR: Shit.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.500
TOM: You know there are people
in this world...

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.010
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.210
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.480
You see,
that's what you have to do.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.410
You have to use your mind...

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.580
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.990
and you can make millions--
never have to work again.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.190
MICHAEL: You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.090
Sure it was.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.260
The guy made a million dollars.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.670
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.140
a long time ago.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.840
PETER: Really? What was it, Tom?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.440
Well, all right.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.410
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.350
You see, it would be this mat...

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.610
that you would
put on the floor...

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.890
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.220
that you could jump to.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.600
MICHAEL: That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.330
SAMIR: Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.430
Uh, look...

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.770
I gotta get outta here.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.670
I'll see you guys later...

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.680
if I still have a job.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.640
MICHAEL: Yeah.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.510
Our high school
guidance counselor...

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.920
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.080
didn't have to work...

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.390
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.910
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.790
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.950
SAMIR: So what did you say?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.860
I never had an answer.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.600
I guess that's why
I'm working at lnitech.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.160
No. You're working at lnitech...

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.260
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.970
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.370
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.840
SAMIR: You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.070
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.550
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.710
who works in securities--

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.950
MICHAEL: Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.650
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.160
what you would want to do if--

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.160
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.270
[Turns on television]

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.150
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.410
Check out this chick!

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.920
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.980
Iike we can't hear
each other through the wall?

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.320
LAWRENCE: Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.520
No, but...

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.020
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.460
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.330
ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.500
Tumors that are detected--

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.540
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.340
LAWRENCE: Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.920
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.540
Yeah.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.850
A little bit. I...

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.720
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.190
You two still goin' out?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.920
Yeah.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.480
I guess. I--I don't know.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.860
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.060
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.020
What do you mean by that?

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.590
I don't know, man.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.740
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.110
she's the type of chick
that just...

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.300
Uhh.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.410
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l--I--

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.540
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.980
PETER: Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.750
Just--I had a rough day.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.480
LAWRENCE: Tell me about it, man.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.920
Ohh...

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.790
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.890
at six a.m.
every day this week...

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.090
drag up to Las Golindas.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.930
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.700
Let me ask you something.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.340
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.570
does anyone ever say to you...

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.100
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.910
No.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.180
No, man.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.880
Shit, no, man.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.550
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.220
PETER: Huh.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.720
LAWRENCE: We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.890
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.050
I just know it.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.560
LAWRENCE: Well, you can
get out of that easily.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.690
PETER: Yeah? How?

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.890
Well...

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.430
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.460
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.630
PETER: Yeah.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.700
LAWRENCE: So all you gotta do is
avoid him--that's all right...

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.010
I got it--on the last few hours
on Friday...

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.910
duck out early...

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.570
turn off
your answering machine...

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.280
you should be home free, man.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.410
That's a really good idea.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.450
Fuckin' "A," man.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.090
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.030
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.360
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.330
That's it?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.600
If you had a million dollars...

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.700
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.540
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.410
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.210
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.680
Well, not all chicks.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.520
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.710
Good point.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.750
LAWRENCE: What about you, now?
What would you do?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.190
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.450
Well, yeah.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.050
Nothing.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.180
Nothin', huh?

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.400
I would relax.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.610
I would sit on my ass all day.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.910
I would do nothing.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.580
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.110
Take a look at my cousin.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.150
He's broke, don't do shit.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.020
NINA: Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.530
Just a moment.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.030
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.970
Just a moment.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.300
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.930
Just a moment.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.640
BILL:
So, you should ask yourself...

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.270
with every decision you make...

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.470
"ls this good for the company?

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.240
"Am I helping with..."

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.810
PETER: ls that the guy?

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.040
TOM: Yeah. We're screwed.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.640
BILL: OK, then, um...

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.200
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.610
a new member to our team here.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.980
This is, uh...

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.580
Bob Slydell.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.190
Yeah. Uh...

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.620
Bob is a consultant.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.290
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.950
helping us out...

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.460
a little here...

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.960
asking some questions...

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.520
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.260
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.460
around here.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.330
Yeah.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.740
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.110
is Hawaiian shirt day.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.750
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh....

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.380
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.320
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.580
Because I told Bill...

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.090
that if they move my desk
one more time...

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.960
then I'm--I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.490
and I told Dom, too...

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.800
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.030
and I used to be over
by the window...

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.330
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.600
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.110
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.110
because it didn't
bind up as much...

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.770
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.940
PETER: OK, Milton.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.140
MILTON: No, it's not OK,
because if they make me--

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.620
If they take my stapler,
then I'll--I'll--I'll--

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.950
I'll set the building on fire.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.220
PETER:
OK, well, that sounds great.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.060
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.290
MILTON: Peter--

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.440
BILL: Good-bye.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.300
Come on.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.430
Oh, for cryin'--

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.750
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.460
Um...

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.470
I'm gonna need you...

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.400
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.600
so if you could be here
around...

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.130
nine, that would be great.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.410
OK?

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.140
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.980
Um...

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.820
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.450
on Sunday, too, OK?

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.150
We, um...

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.020
Iost some people this week...

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.150
and, uh...

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.260
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.530
Thanks.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.160
PETER: So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.200
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.000
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.710
the day before it.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.380
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.220
that's on the worst day
of my life.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.450
What about today?

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.790
Is today
the worst day of your life?

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.450
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's messed up.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.890
I'm sorry.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.190
Go on.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.800
PETER: ls there any way
that you could sort of...

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.640
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.160
that I'm at work...in here?

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.680
Could I come home...

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.200
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.980
That's...really not what I do,
Peter.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.350
Heh.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.550
However...

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.080
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.220
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.090
I want you to try and relax.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.660
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.970
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.910
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.910
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.280
as you slip deeper and deeper...

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.690
into a state
of complete relaxation.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.920
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.520
Deeper and deeper.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.530
Way down.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.760
Your concern about your job...

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.800
melts away...

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.800
way...

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.310
way down.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.710
Unh.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.210
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.710
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.720
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.420
and you will remain
in that state...

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.960
until I snap my fingers.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.480
Three.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.290
Deeper and deeper.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.020
Way...

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.550

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.160

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.320
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.590
It's about...

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.430
ten o'clock.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.930
Yeah. Just, uh...

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.400
wondering where you are.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.560

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.930

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.100
Yeah. Hi.
It's Bill Lumbergh again.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.110
Uh...

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.770
I just wanted
to make sure you knew...

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.330
that we did start
at the, uh...

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.850
usual time this morning.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.110
Yeah. It isn't a half day
or anything like that...

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.180
so if you could just go ahead...

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.240
and get here
as soon as possible...

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.150
that would be terrific.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.790
PETER: Ahh...

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.940
BILL: Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum--

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.280
Yeah. It's--
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber--

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.150
Yeah. It's me again.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.080
Uh, I was away from my desk
for a minute.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.250
-[Telephone rings]
-Just checking in.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.580
Hello?

ANNE: Peter, what's going on?

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.590
PETER: Huh?

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.060
ANNE: It's three-thirty.
Why aren't you at work?

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.090
Because l--I--

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.570
I didn't feel like it.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.770
ANNE:
Peter, what's gotten into you?

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.860
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.770
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.540
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.370
-That's total bull--

Nobody hangs up on me.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.110
We're through.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.120
Oh, and one more thing...

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.280
I've been cheating on you!

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.850
[Anne hangs up, machine beeps]

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.230
BILL: So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.800
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.860
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.240
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets--

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.800
TOM: Where's Peter?

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.280
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

MICHAEL: Uh, I don't know.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.000
BILL:
...really, really help us out.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.570
MICHAEL: Who's that guy?

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.280
BILL: So, uh...any questions?

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.460
Hi. I'm Peter.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.630
JOANNA: Hi. Can I help you?

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:23.830
PETER: What are you doin'
for lunch today?

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:27.470
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.770
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

PETER: I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.520
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.350
Are you--are you serious?

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.550
PETER: Yeah.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.820
Yeah. I--I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.900
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.400
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.130
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.400
no big deal, all right?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.370
And if not, that's cool, too.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.670
-OK?
-OK.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.870

JOANNA: When you say,
"next door..."

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.570
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.310
PETER: Flinger's.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.510
JOANNA: OK.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.050
What you do at lnitech...

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.960
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.460
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.760
TOM: Yes. Y-yes.
That's--that's right.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.490
PORTER:
Well, then I just have to ask...

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.790
why couldn't the customers...

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.390
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.460
TOM: Well, I'll tell you why.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.430
Uh, because...

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.770
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.510
SLYDELL: Uh-huh. So...

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:44.210
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.380
Well...

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.950
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.760
SLYDELL: Huh.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.560
PORTER: So then you must
physically bring them...

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.690
to the software people.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.820
Well...

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.290
no.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.630
I mean...

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.230
sometimes.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.540
SLYDELL: What--what would you
say you do here?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.740
Well, look,
I already told you.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.080
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.980
so the engineers don't have to.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.070
I have people skills.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.140
I am good at dealing
with people!

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.580
Can't you understand that?!

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.110
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.350
I--

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.160
SLYDELL: Let's see...

you are...

-Bolton?
-Yeah.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.470
PORTER:
ls that your real name?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.400
MICHAEL: Yeah.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.540
SLYDELL: Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.610
MICHAEL: No, it's--it's
just a coincidence.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.240
SLYDELL: Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.950
I love his music. I do.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.180
-I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
-Me, too.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.920
SLYDELL: For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.390
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.400
But you must really
love his music, huh?

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.230
[Men laugh]

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.630
Yeah, he's--he's...

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.400
he's pretty--
he's pretty good, I guess.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.100
You're goddamn right, he is.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.630
-[Men laugh]
-Right.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.110
PORTER: So tell me, what's
your favorite song of his?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.480
Mmm...

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.180
[Michael clears throat]

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.270
I don't--I don't know.
Heh heh.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.680
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.880
SLYDELL: That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.220
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.720
being you have
the same name as him.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.690
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.250
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.490
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.060
Hi.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.400
Hey.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.240
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.410
I think it would be OK.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.210
Would you like to sit down?

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.480
OK.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.810
Ahh.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.450
Wow!

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.290
This place is really...nice.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.690
Yeah. Is it?

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.960
JOANNA: Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.330
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.330
I like yours.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.530
JOANNA: Ugh!

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.400
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.530
JOANNA: Yeah.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.010
Really. Ha ha.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.440
It's on your...

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.010
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.020
That's, uh...

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.040
That's one of my--
my pieces of flair.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.210
PETER:
What's a "piece of flair"?

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.280
JOANNA:
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.920
Iike these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.050
We're actually required
to wear...

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.090
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.360
It's really stupid, actually.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.630
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.160
JOANNA: Yeah, yeah, we do.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.400
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.770
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.470
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.840
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.320
OK.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.380
JOANNA:
So, where do you, work, Peter?

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.940
PETER: lnitech.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.790
JOANNA: And--Yeah?
What--what do you do there?

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.650
I sit in a cubicle...

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.660
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.260
What's that?

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.490
PETER: Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.500
and, uh, to save space...

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.330
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.340
So like 98 instead of 1998.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.610
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.480
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.450
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.780
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.320
You're just not gonna go?

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.580
PETER: Yeah.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.780
Won't you get fired?

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.950
I don't know.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.790
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.060
So you're gonna quit?

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.300
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.930
I'm just gonna stop going.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.300
PETER: What?

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.430
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.600
PETER: About an hour ago.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.110
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.310
JOANNA: An hour ago.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.240
So you're gonna get another job?

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.440
I don't think I'd like
another job.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.390
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and--

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.980
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.490
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.720
Ahh...

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.890
well, so what do you want to do?

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.920
I want to take you
out to dinner...

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.330
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.670
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.570
I love "Kung Fu."

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.910
-Channel 39.
-Totally.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.740
PETER: You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.770
-OK.
-Great.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.010
OK. Can we order lunch first?

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.610
-Yeah.
-OK.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.710

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.990
[Inaudible conversation]

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.260
BILL:
Took a stapler off my desk...

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.840

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.570
BILL: Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.790
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.410
MILTON: Nothing.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.420
BILL: I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.750
and move your desk
again, so...

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.590
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.530
against that wall as possible...

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.860
that would be great.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.420
MILTON: No, because I was--

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.990
BILL: That way,
we'll have some room...

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.870
for some of these boxes
and things...

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.070
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.560
Oh. Oh, there it is.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.340
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.400
[Milton moans]

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.740
Great.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.220
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.020
that would be terrific, OK?

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.820
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.090

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.530
I could set the building
on fire.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.830
-Peter.
-Michael.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.000
What the hell's going on, man?

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.900
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.030
No. I just came to get
my address book.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.270
I'm not gonna stay.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.640
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.440
MICHAEL: What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.470
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.220
PETER: Michael, I did nothing.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.740
I did absolutely nothing...

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.760
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.450
MICHAEL: I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.090
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.320
PETER: The who?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.700
MICHAEL: The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.930
PETER: Oh, yeah...right.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.740
MICHAEL: Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.900
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.140
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.010
It's the best day of my life.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.650
SLYDELL: Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.850
PORTER: Uh-huh.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.150
SLYDELL: Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.850
You must be Peter Gibbons.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.290
Uh-huh. Terrific.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.760
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.260
PETER: Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.820
SLYDELL: Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.130
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.140
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.070
for how people spend their day
at work.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.840
So if you would...

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.440
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.950
-Yeah.
-Great.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.470
PETER: Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.990
Uh, I use the side door.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.010
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.020
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.620
PORTER: Uh, "space out"?

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.790
PETER: Yeah.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.700
I just stare at my desk.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.220
But it looks like I'm working.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.140
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.000
I'd say in a given week...

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.910
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.810
of real, actual work.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.580
SLYDELL: Peter,
would you be a good sport...

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.610
and indulge us and just...

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.710
tell us a little more?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.280
Oh, yeah.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.020
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.220
Ahh...

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.700
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.760
It's that I just don't care.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.990
PORTER: Don't...don't care?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.600
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.260
Now, if I work my ass off...

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.210
and lnitech
ships a few extra units...

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.110
I don't see another dime.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.740
So where's the motivation?

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.450
And here's something else,
Bob...

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.450
I have eight different bosses
right now.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.610
-I beg your pardon?
-Eight bosses.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:36.780
-Eight?
-Eight, Bob.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.580
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.280
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.660
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.960
That and the fear
of losing my job.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.860
But you know, Bob...

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.590
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.790
not to get fired.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.460
SLYDELL: Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.800
PETER: OK.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.800
SLYDELL: What if--
and believe me...

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.830
this is strictly hypothetical--

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.940
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.710
equity-sharing program?

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.050
Would that do anything for you?

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.350
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.410
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.720
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.390
SLYDELL: Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.020
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.890
I hope your firings
go really well.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.130
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.900
SLYDELL: Great. Wow.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.940
BILL:
So, Peter, what's happening?

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.340
Listen, uh...

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.120
STAN: Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.060
JOANNA: Yeah.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.320
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and l, uh...

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.950
STAN: We need to talk about
your flair.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.700
JOANNA: Really?
l--I have fifteen pieces on.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.260
I also...

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.500
STAN: Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.670
JOANNA: Oh. OK.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.680
STAN: Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.610
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.870
Well, like Brian, for example...

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.350
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.750
And a terrific smile.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.080
OK, so you want me to wear more?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.850
Look, Joanna...

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.020
Yeah?

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.960
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.120
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.260
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.990
-It's about fun.
-Yeah.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.190
OK, so more then, yeah?

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.200
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.700
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.610
but some people choose
to wear more...

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.510
and we encourage that, OK?

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.840
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.080
Y-yeah.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.590
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.180
OK.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.090
SLYDELL: Right, so there's
three more people...

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.160
we can easily lose.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.430
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.460
He's useless.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.100
Gone.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.770
DOM: Sounds good to me.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.210
SLYDELL: Here's a peculiar...

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.580
-Uh, Milton Waddams.
-Who's he?

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.640
PORTER: You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.810
DOM: Oh, yeah.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.540
SLYDELL: We--we can't actually
find a record...

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.920
of him being
a current employee here.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.820
PORTER: I looked into it
more deeply...

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.820
and I found that
apparently what happened...

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.620
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.850
and no one ever
told him about it...

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.390
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.800
he still gets a paycheck.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.700
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.860
BILL: Great.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.630
DOM:
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.800
SLYDELL: Just a second there,
professor.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.430
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.640
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.170
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.310
PORTER: We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.480
The problem is solved
from your end.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.650

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.180
SLYDELL: I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.820
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.490
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.290
with upper management
written all over him.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.730
Eech. Ooh.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.100
Yeah. Um...

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.430
I'm going to have to go ahead...

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.670
and sort of disagree
with you there.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.300
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.140
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.480
that we would want
for upper management.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.210
He's also been having
some problems...

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.150
with his T.P.S. reports.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.190
PORTER: I'll handle this.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.320
We feel...

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.490
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.330
SLYDELL: Mm-mmm.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.490
PORTER: It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:45.660
to get him really motivated.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.860
SLYDELL: There it is.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.830
Yeah...Ah, well...

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.170
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.940
SLYDELL: Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.280
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.280
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.680
Yeah...

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.670
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.980
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.650
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.280
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.390
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.920
And niggers always
gotta hide here

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.800
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.100
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.800
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.870
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.380
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.210
Up three-sixty-five
and twenty-four-seven

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.810
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't sleep

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.840
And all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.350
cootchie-eatin',
jealous-hearted pranksters...

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.550
[Alarm blaring]

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.260
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.360
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.930
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.770
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.120
DOM: Hi, Peter.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.950
PETER: Oh, hi, Dom.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.480
GETO BOYS RAPPING:
Although I was born in Jamaica

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.220
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.960
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.230
I mean,
one that you don't really know

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.230
Riding around town
in a drop top Benz

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.240
Hittin' switches
in my black six-four

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.040
Now gangsta ass niggers
come in all shapes and colors

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.470
Some got killed in the past

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.140
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.110
Started living for the Lord
and not laughs

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.880
Now all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.180
crumb snatchin',
cootchie-eatin' pranksters

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.810
When the Grim Reaper steps up

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.290
What the hell you gonna do?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.480
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.200
BILL: So...Peter...

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.360
what's happening?

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.740
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.710
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.110
PETER: No.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.910
Ahh...yeah...

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.890
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.860
and have a little talk, hmm?

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.920
PETER: Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm--I'm kinda busy.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.790
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.930
Just come back another time.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.330
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.600
BILL: Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.830
PETER:
Yeah, they called me at home.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.770
BILL: That sounds good, Peter.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.010
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.380
get this all fixed up for you.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.540
Great.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.080

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.290
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:25.490

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.890
I--I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:32.560
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.900
I did and they said--

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.800
BILL:
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.600
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.370
No, l--I...

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:45.400
BILL: New people are coming,
and we need the space.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.780
MILTON: But there's no space--

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.410
BILL: So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:52.180
and move it down there...

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.250
that would be terrific.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:55.650
OK?

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.750
MILTON: Uh, excuse me...

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:03.390
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.700
PORTER: You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.900
PETER: I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:10.670
PORTER: Good one.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.540
SLYDELL:
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.770
I'm sure you've--you've heard
some of the rumors...

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.570
circulating
around the hallways...

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.410
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.750
with some software people.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.980
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.050
PORTER: We'll be getting rid
of these people.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.960
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.190
SLYDELL: Naga...

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.490
PORTER: Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.990
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.760
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.330
PORTER: Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.600
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.900
SLYDELL: It's standard
operating procedure.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.170
PETER: Do they know this yet?

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.410
SLYDELL: No. No, of course not.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.320
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.610
Studies have
statistically shown...

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.280
there's less chance
of an incident...

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.020
if you do it at the end
of the week.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.220
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.960
to have as many
as four people...

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.330
working right underneath you.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.530
This is a big promotion, Pete.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.260
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.130
and give me more money?

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.840
SLYDELL: Uh-huh.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.140
Wow!

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.170
MICHAEL: Hmm. Yeah.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.050
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.410
Give it to me.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.940
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.580
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.180
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck--

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.090
-Michael.
-Hey.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.490
PETER: Listen to me.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.590
What are you doing tonight?

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:47.070
PETER: Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.630
and maybe that time for you
is now...

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.440
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.570
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.340
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.650
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.740
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.520
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.020
Yeah, and, uh, and l--Listen...

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.860
That virus
you're always talking about...

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.090
the one that could
rip off the company...

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.600
for a bunch of money.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.930
Yeah, what about it?

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.630
Well, how does it work?

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.840
It's pretty brilliant.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.030
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.570
where interest is computed--
there are thousands a day--

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.600
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.170
which it usually rounds off.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.610
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.620
and puts it into an account.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.380
-This sounds familiar.
-They did it in "Superman Ill."

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.620
PETER: Right, uh...

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.390
MICHAEL:
An underrated movie, actually.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.830
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.920
-So they check for this now.
-No, here's the thing.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.260
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.460
they'd never notice.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.530
You're right.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.970
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.980
MICHAEL: Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:04.970
PETER: So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.540
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.250
What if you didn't have
a good job?

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.920
MICHAEL: Cock gobblers!

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.360
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.630
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.530
Actually, I'm being promoted.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.260
-What?!
-I know, Michael.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.830
It's completely unfair.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.400
And I realized something today.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.410
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.410
It's about all of us together.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.480
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.040
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.820
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.850
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.860
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.160
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.170
staring at computer screens
all day...

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.360
filling out useless forms...

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.060
and listening
to eight different bosses...

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.600
drone on
about mission statements.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.580
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:12.310
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.250
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.380
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.820
Five years...

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.690
of your mid-twenties now gone.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.020
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.720
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.560
You know why?

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.040
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.730
Ugh.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.900
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.930
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.270
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.680
Your software works, right?

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.440
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.010
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.610
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.360
Yeah. But Samir does.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.890
SAMIR:
But that's not much money.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.160
PETER: That's the beauty of it.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.290
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.600
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.100
you space it out
over a couple of years...

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.430
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.730
It's like "Superman Ill."

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.830
SAMIR: "Superman Ill"?

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.610
I have to leave now.
I have to get my résumé ready.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:22.880
PETER: For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.650
SAMIR:
That's right. If I'm lucky.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:29.850
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.690
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.220
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.290
Come on. Sit down.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.500
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.500
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.970
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.410
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.140
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.840
-Really?
-Yes.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.250
MICHAEL: Shit!

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.010
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.850
So what do you think?

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.410
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.650
PETER: Samir?

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.190
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.390
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.830
Tomorrow is your last day
at lnitech.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.430
You have two options--

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.900
unemployment
or early retirement.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.500
What's it gonna be?

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.940
-I have a question.
-Yes?

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.740
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.480
Yep, you sure can.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.250
OK, I'll do it.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.220
PETER: That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.660
Can we discuss the plan?

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.420
OK, yeah, good, right.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.950
It works like a computer virus.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.620
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.890
It'll do the rest.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.300
PETER: Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.240
Before we go any further,
all right?

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.800
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.370
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.500
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:00.780
-Of course.
-Agreed.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.050
LAWRENCE: Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.310
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.790
PETER: All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.720
SLYDELL: Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.020
PETER: Thank you, Bob.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.320
PORTER: We'll get some people
under you right away.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.030
ICE CUBE RAPPING:
I got something for your mind

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.730
Your body and your soul

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.540
I got something for your mind

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.100
Your body and your soul

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.380
[Bang bang]

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.340
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.580
Sippin' on Crevassier

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.650
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.290
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.850
But it's necessary

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.420
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.030
I put the pedal to the floor

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.970
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.300
You know how it's done

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.900
Slammin', bumpin'

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.540
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.050
She's flyin' in the Blazer

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.210
Like no Speed Racer

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.650
But I ain't gonna chase her

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.090
Like Racer X

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.950
But I won't flex

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.720
Till it's time to have sex

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.990
So when you want
to get together?

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:26.860
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.930

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.350
MICHAEL: That was easy.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.440
Yeah, I guess it was.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.110
What'd you do with the--

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.090
DREW: Hey, man.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.820
PETER: Oh, hey, Drew.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.520
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.720
That he got laid off?

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.280
No, man, check it out.

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.920
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.330
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.530
PETER: ls he dead?

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.160
DREW: No, man, check it out.

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.370
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.310
DREW: He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.310
TOM: I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:12.710
It's jammed.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.240
I--I couldn't get it
into drive.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.050
-I--I--I mean, reverse.
-You OK, Tom?

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.420
DREW:
Then as he's lookin' at her...

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.480
he decides he wants to live.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.050
TOM: Yeah, I think I'm OK.

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.490
Right.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.720
Seems to be working now.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.260
See you later, honey.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.530
Love ya.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:38.070
DREW: But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway...Bam !

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.770
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.800
-Is he OK?
-Sort of.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.040
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.280
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.540
Like seven figures.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.110
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.120
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.180
We're all invited.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.950
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:00.520
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.960
Oh, oh, oh...

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.090
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.330
Yeah. Right.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.700
See you guys there.

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.240
MICHAEL:
Wow, our last day at lnitech.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.570
SAMIR: I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.840
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.280
I stole something.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.380
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.080
PETER:
No, I stole something else.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.590
What did you steal?

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.460
Call it a going-away present.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.840
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.310
Is the group
harder than an erection

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.150
That shows no affection

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.980
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.450
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.350
Die, motherfuckers

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.480
Nothing but the ghetto

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.320
Taking drugs, step slow

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.830
Kept my head low

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.120
And never let go

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.990
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.900
I'm going insane

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.300
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.130
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.870
I done the shit
that they believe in

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.670
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.830
I seen this

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.540
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.200
Because it's die, motherfucker

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.770
Die, motherfucker

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:28.680
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.690
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.160
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.660
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:40.680
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.460
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.830
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:47.460
I think it's something
in the water

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.830
I think it's something
in the water

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.800
So good to be free again

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.470
With unity for men

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.140
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.440
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.780
The murder rate may decrease

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.780
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.180
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.550
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.560
For no reason

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.650
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.180
MICHAEL: Who's got my keys?

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:14.630
SAMIR: I'm driving.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.390
PETER:
Everything is gonna be OK.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:18.330
All right? OK?

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.990
It's fun, and it's exciting.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:22.590
I gotta--I gotta go. All right?

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.860
Joanna's coming over.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.100
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.340
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.500
Everything will be OK.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.710
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.480
All right? Good night!

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.210
with the resurrection

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.950
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:46.760
Oh, um...l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.590
I really can't.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.400
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.600
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.570
that just get rounded off.

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.200
So we simplified
the whole thing...

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.540
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.570
into an account that we opened.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.120
So you're stealing?

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.050
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:17.890
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:20.990
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.400
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.200
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.570
-Yeah.
-Right.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.730
It's not yours?

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:33.000
Uh...well, it becomes ours.

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.840
How is that not stealing?

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.780
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.940
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.280
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.620
From the crippled children?

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:48.850
No, that's the jar.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:52.420
I'm talking about the tray--
the pennies for everybody.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.860
Oh, for everybody. OK.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.990
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.930
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.800
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.930
and we do it
a couple of million times.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.500
So what's wrong with that?

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.200
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.440
PETER: It's not wrong.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.700
Initech is wrong.

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.300
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.440
Chotchkie's is wrong.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.450
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.540
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.020
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.750
taking money from the register.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.020
Well, maybe you should.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:29.130
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.430
What?

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:33.830
Look, we don't...l'm--

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.530
We don't have
to talk about this now.

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:39.060
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.830
TOM: Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.030
-Hey, Tom.
-Hello, Tom.

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:49.200
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.000
Rob, Michael. Samir.

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.530
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.600
PETER: Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.550
-This is, uh, Joanna.
-Hi.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.980
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.420

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.560
Ooh, ooh.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.990
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.030
Well...what do you think?
It's a prototype.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.870
PETER: Huh...that's...

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.460
that's exactly as you
described it.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.070
Uh, listen, I heard about
your--your settlement.

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.340
Congratulations.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.540
Well, thanks, Peter.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.520
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:37.920
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.650
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.420
I used to be the same way.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.480
-Really?
-Sure.

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.220
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.130
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.500
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:52.900
Wow.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.530
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.770
good things can happen
in this world.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.900
I mean, look at me.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.340
Thanks, Tom.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.280
TOM: Ah, sure.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.810
[Music playing]

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.920
ROB: Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.650
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:20.860
I have a client in there
right now.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.560
He says the trick is...

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.500
kick someone's ass
the first day...

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.020
or become someone's bitch.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:28.700
Then everything
will be all right.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.400
Why do you ask, anyway?

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.740
MICHAEL: Oh, no, we just--

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.970
SAMIR: It's a...

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.310
-Hey, Peter.
-Drew.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.580
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.420
-Yeah.
-Lucky bastard.

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:50.850
DREW: Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.690
PETER: Yep.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.360
Who's she here with?

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.660
She's with me.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.630
-Really?
-Yep.

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:03.100
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.270
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.740
Why's that, Drew?

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.470
Are you kidding me?

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.570
She gets around. All right?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.110
She does, does she?

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.280
Oh, yeah, like a record.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.660
PETER: Like with who?

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:26.660
Oh, let's see, uh...

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.820
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.660
Uh, let me see, who else?

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.960
Lumbergh?

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.740
JOANNA: What if you get caught?

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.040
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.170
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.580
What?

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.810
What are you--

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:52.010
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:53.540
Aah!

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.750
Oh...God...Lumbergh!

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.780
Peter, what is wrong with you?

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.560
That was, like, two years ago.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.030
What? Did you know him?

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.690
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:05.060
He's my boss.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.560
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.700
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.040
PETER: He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.840
and you slept with him.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.310
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.220
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.480
I don't care.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.610
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:27.880
Listen to you.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.410
Who do you think you are?

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.020
How dare you judge me?

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.890
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.690
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.430
wannabe criminal man.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.200
Yeah, well, that may be.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.730
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.090
OK, that's...l'm done.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.380
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.290
Call me when you grow up.

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.520
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.790
So don't call me, OK?

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.030
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.740
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.330
Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.610
Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.610
That is great.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.740
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.580
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.250
Ooh.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.950
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.430
That's it. Great.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.620
Peter, what's happening?

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.570
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.800
Oh!

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.580
-Joanna.
-Yeah.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.030
We need to talk.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.960
Do you know what this is about?

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.500
My, uh, flair?

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.700
Yeah.

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.570
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.040
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.410
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:14.540
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.850
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.180
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.590
Iike your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.260
why don't you just
make the minimum...

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.290
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.960
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.270
that you wanted
to express yourself.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.300
JOANNA: Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.830
I do want to express myself.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.710
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.910
All right? There's my flair. OK?

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:50.280
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.050
There it is.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.680
I hate this job.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.390
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.300
Oh, shit.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.970
-Shit.
-Shit.

01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.570
-Shit.
-Son of a bitch.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.350
-Shit.
-This is a fuck.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.510
SAMIR: l--I...Shit.

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.040
MICHAEL: What happened?

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:25.280
PETER: You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.910
SAMIR: Yes, it's your software.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.150
PETER: Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:31.920
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred....

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.230
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.630
SAMIR: Oh, shit.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:38.690
MICHAEL: They probably
won't know it's gone...

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.530
for another three or four days.

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:44.170
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.730
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.070
MICHAEL:
Technically, it did work.

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.440
No, it didn't!

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.420
SAMIR:
It did not work, Michael, OK?

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.040
MICHAEL: OK.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.280
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.850
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.950
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.550
MICHAEL:
Quit getting pissed at me.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.500
This was all your idea, asshole.

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:10.760
All right. OK.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.330
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.930
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.700
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.980
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:29.010
Happy birthday to you

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:34.720
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.850
Happy birthday to you

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.570
BILL: Looks terrific.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.760
Mmm.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.500
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.970
Mmm.

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:54.440
Oh, that is terrific.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.810
Just terrific.

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:59.610
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:01.020
It's very special.

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:03.350
NINA:
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:06.690
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.850
MILTON: But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told--

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.420
Just pass.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:16.660
OK, here. But this...

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:21.760
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.800
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.890
the building on fire.

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.060
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.930
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.940
I--I think
they'd figure that out.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.200
Well, we have to do something.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.230
Maybe we could launder
the money.

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.570
That's a great idea.

01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:04.710
OK, how do we do that?

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.480
I don't know.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.250
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:10.050
I think coke dealers do it.

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:12.650
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.020
My cousin's a cokehead.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.120
Fuck.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.460
We're in deep shit.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.230
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.180
-Milton.
-Yes.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:35.440
BILL: What's happening?

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.000
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.170
MILTON: But...no.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.050
BILL: Since you're down here...

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.320
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.150
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.250
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.130
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.560
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.790
and crawl down--

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.300
DOM: Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.200
We got a big problem--big.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.170
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.570
'Scuse me.

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:13.640
'Scuse me.

[Door closes]

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:20.210
OK...but that's
the last straw.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.750
Here we go, here we go.

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:27.060
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash--"

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.360
"To conceal the source
of money...

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.670
"as by channeling it through
an intermediary."

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:35.870
"To conceal..."

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:38.430
SAMIR: That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.200
PETER: I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.410
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:47.010
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.850
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.110
That's what I can't believe.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:53.150
-Yeah. You didn't know that?
-Yeah, you didn't know that?

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:55.220
MICHAEL: A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:01.530
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the lnitrode guy? The young guy?

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:04.090
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.970
Her fucking--Her children
would have hooves.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.540
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.940
[Knock on door]

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.670
SAMIR: Who's that?

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.200
All right, nobody panic.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.940
Probably just Lawrence.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:25.220
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.810
I come from a rough area.

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.480
I used to be addicted
to crack...

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.490
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:33.000
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.060
-No, no.
-Wait a minute.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.070
MICHAEL: You used to be
addicted to crack?

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.860
Yeah. Um...

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:43.670
Look, I'm very sorry.

01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:46.270
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:48.780
MICHAEL: We're not asking you
about money laundering.

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.210
All we need is for you
to hook us--

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.080
PETER: lf he doesn't
know anybody--

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.910
SAMIR: No. Wait a minute.

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:56.920
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.350
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:00.580
STEVE: I lied.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.720
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.230
just helps me sell magazines.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.730
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.700
-You're a software engineer?
-Yep.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.330
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.040
Actually, man...

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.140
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.670
than I ever did at lnitrode.

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.880
Heh. At lnitrode?

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.940
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:29.350
about all this stuff
we told you.

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:32.620
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.120
Actually, um,
that all depends.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.060
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.500
MICHAEL:
We never should have done this.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.370
What were we thinking?

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.430
You know what I can't
figure out?

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.710
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.180
can be so good at crime...

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.700
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.310
SAMIR: We're new to it, though.

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.910
If we had more experience...

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:06.390
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.910
I think
there's enough evidence...

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.020
all over that building
to link us to this.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.190
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.860
What we've done is bad enough.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.190
We get caught
laundering money...

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.260
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.270
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.400
SAMIR: I don't want to go
to any prison.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.740
Why the hell did I do this?

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.470
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.770
We weren't thinking clearly...

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:31.010
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.450
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.750
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.340

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:39.480
I'm going home.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.680
Me, too.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.520
You are a very...
bad person, Peter.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.590

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.070
Lawrence, you awake?

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.330
LAWRENCE: Yeah.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.370
You wanna come over?

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.530
LAWRENCE: No, thanks, man.

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:15.800
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

[Crickets chirping]

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.280
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.780
that you have committed
against lnitech...

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.880
I hereby sentence you,

Peter Gibbons...

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:49.240
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.880
and you're a very bad person.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:56.810

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.280
Hey.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.280
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.520
JOANNA: No, no. I got fired.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.850
-What happened?
-I flipped off my boss.

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.020
JOANNA: Some customers...

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.830
Actually, a line cook...

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.860
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.290
I might be going away
for a while.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.790
Uh...to jail.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.810
You were right
about that computer scam.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.170
That was a bad idea.

01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:00.770
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:04.250
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.680
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:10.350
Joanna, I want to apologize.

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:12.910
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.590
Lumbergh is not my problem.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:16.720
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.720
I don't know why I can't just...
go to work and be happy...

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.230
Iike I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.460
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.530
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:31.440
Yeah. Well...

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.200
I may never be happy
at my job...

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:38.150
but I think that if
I could be with you...

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.240
that I could be happy
with my life.

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:42.310
I've been a real asshole.

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:45.520
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise--

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.790
OK, shut up.

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:53.990
BRIAN:
Whoa! Hey, what's going on here?

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:56.520
Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.070
I hate that guy.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.970
MILTON: Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.830
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.400
And I still haven't received
my paycheck.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.170
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:05.580
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:07.510
And there was
garbage on it, and--

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.070
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.640
Mr. Lumbergh
should be here any minute.

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:14.950
-Mr. Lumbergh--
-Just go sit at your desk.

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.480
OK. But, l--I'm gonna just...

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:20.020

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.030
I have to take
my stapler back...

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:30.770
because I told him
it's my stapler.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.540
It's my stapler.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.310
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:00.390

Whoa. Hey, Peter, man.

PETER: Hey.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.810
So, I might be going away
for a while.

LAWRENCE: Yeah, I know, man.

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.370
It's a bummer, dude.
What can I say?

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.440
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:21.680
Well, time to go face the music.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.350

if I don't see you, all right?

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.690

PETER: Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.430
You don't want that, Peter, man.

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:12.900
That's toasted, man.

01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:16.130

who might want this.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.750
PETER: Brought mine in a pail...

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:36.380
plus Joanna's supposed
to come by a little later.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.860
SAMIR:
How do you like your new job?

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.860
PETER: Not too bad, not too bad.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.490
How's Penetrode?

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.800
PETER: Yeah, yeah.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.570
MICHAEL:
Probably get you a job there.

01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:53.440
PETER: No, thanks. I, uh...

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.910
I'm doing good here.

01:21:56.710 --> 01:22:00.550
So, uh...
we're gonna be OK, right?

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.410
Yeah.

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:05.840
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:08.520
I wonder if the money burn up.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.850
It would be shame.

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.320
Yeah.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.260
SAMIR: So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.600

I'm definitely sure of.

May I speak to you, please?

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.280
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a piña colada.

And I said no salt, no salt...

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.450
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.730
I could shut
this whole resort down.

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.360
Sir?

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.840
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:35.330
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.640
I could have this place
condemned.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.510
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.340
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

About an hour from now

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.460
You should be
at your place of employment

in a dress, man.

Ha ha ha. You big fag.

CANIBUS RAPPING: You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.310
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

People get depressed,
they get ulcers

From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.010
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:38.580
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.060
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:43.750
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:45.280

at Hooters now, you know...

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.690

Put your middle finger
up slowly

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.690
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

"Who do you think you are?"

Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

and get you in the car later on

for a new nine-to-five job

ain't that long

filling out W-9 forms

01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:44.390
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.050
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:48.750
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:50.690
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:52.290
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.230
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:57.600
I ain't working here no more

01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.540
Take this job and shove it

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:02.800
I ain't working here no more

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.140
Take this job and shove it

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:08.040
I ain't working here no more

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.850
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.510
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:18.020
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.610
While the most hated get placed

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.280
In some small cubicle spaces

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.950
Or get thrown down
in the basement

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.720
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.990
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:29.330
And you still ain't get paid yet

01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:30.860
Here's an optimistic motto

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.560
If you ever late for today

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.470
You can stay early for tomorrow

01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:36.200
Most nine-to-fives are hard

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.670
'Cause the description
of the job

01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:39.440
Ain't no picnic in the park

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.340
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.870
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.350
BIZ MARKIE RAPPING: You came in
late, you already ate

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.980
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.750
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.760
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.520

Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,

Ah-aah aah-ah

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.870
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.380
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:05.950
From, from Canibus
