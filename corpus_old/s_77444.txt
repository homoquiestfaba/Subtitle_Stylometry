Dear Mr. Stevens:

You will be surprised to hear
from me after all this time.

You've been in my thoughts since
I heard Lord Darlington had died.

We read that his heirs
put Darlington Hall up for sale...

...as they no longer wished
to maintain it.

As no one would buy
such a large house...

... the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.

We also saw some rubbish in the
Daily Mail which made my blood boil:

"Traitor's nest to be pulled down. "

One hundred and eighty guineas?

One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

Lot 414...

...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
A Portly Gentleman.

I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

2000 guineas, thank you.

2200.

2400.

2600.

2800.

3000. 3200.

3400. 3600.

3800.

4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

5000.

And a half.

6000.

And a half.

7000.

And a half.

8000.

And a half.

9'000.

And a half.

10,000 guineas is bid.

And a half.

11,000.

And a half.

Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

I was very relieved to read
how an American millionaire...

...named Lewis saved
Darlington Hall...

...so you wouldn't be turned out
of your home after all.

Is it the same Congressman Lewis...

...who attended His Lordship's
conference in 1936?

Mr. Stevens, I so often think
of the good old days...

...when I was the housekeeper.

It was hard work...

...and I have known butlers easier
to please than our Mr. Stevens...

...but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life.

You must have a completely
different staff now.

Not many of the old faces
around anymore.

There's not much need
for the small army of footmen...

... that Lord Darlington employed.

My own news is not very cheerful.

In the 7 years since I last wrote,
I have again left my husband...

...and, sad to say,
my marriage seems to be over.

I'm staying at a friend's
boarding house in Clevedon.

I don't know what my future is.

Since Catherine, my daughter, got
married, my life has been empty.

The years stretch before me and
if only I knew how to fill them.

But I would like to be useful again.

-Burned again?
-Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

A faulty one, unfortunately.

Sir, quite recently...

...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

...around the country.

Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

Thank you, sir.

When did you last see the world?

The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

You may say so.

Take off when I'm in London next week.

I tell you what, you take the car.

-Take the Daimler.
-Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

You and that Daimler belong together.

You were made for each other.

That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

I'd meant to travel the West, where l
understand we have splendid scenery.

And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

What's this, your girlfriend?

Or a former attachment?

Oh, no, sir.

No, but a very able housekeeper.

A most able housekeeper.

I was just kidding, Stevens.

Sorry.

You know what I like best
about your papers?

These obituaries.

Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

-It's not an art we have in the States.
-lndeed, sir.

Thank you, Stevens.

Mr. Lewis.

Dear Mrs. Benn...

...I propose to reach Clevedon
on October 3rd around 4 p.m.

I'd be grateful for a line from you...

...to reach me at the post office
at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...

...where I'm planning to stop.

Mrs. Benn, I always said you
possess an amazing memory.

Our new employer is indeed
Congressman Lewis...

... though he's now retired
from political life in the U.S.

He's taken up residence at Darlington
Hall, soon to be joined by his family.

But I regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size.

Mrs. Benn, will you permit me
once again to sing your praises?

Let me state that when you left
to get married...

...no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department.

I well remember your arrival
at Darlington Hall.

You came somewhat unexpectedly,
one might even say impulsively...

...while we were dead in the middle
of the Charlgrove meet.

That day is marked in my
memory in another way as well.

It was the last time His Lordship...

...was happy to welcome
his neighbours, as in the old days.

Of course, it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt.

It was never a sport His Lordship
enjoyed or approved of.

-Good morning, Ayres.
-My lord, nice to see you.

Excuse me, sir.

I fear I may have been a little
unwelcoming, even a little short.

You presented the best references
I've ever seen.

Which proved to be well-deserved.

Though, I confess, I did have my
doubts, on account of your youth.

No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

Inside the house too.

The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

What I find a major irritation...

...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

-No offense intended, of course.
-None taken.

I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

Yes, indeed.

-Might I have a word, sir?
-Of course.

My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

Bad business.
How are you managing?

I've found two
first-rate replacements.

Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

And a man with
considerable experience.

-Older and happy to be under-butler.
-Name?

Stevens, sir.

-Stevens?
-Yes, sir.

-That's your name.
-He's my father, sir.

Really?

Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

He's outside the door.

Good. Bring him in.

Thank you, my lord.

Father.

Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

-My lord.
-Very good man here, your son.

He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

-Proud of him?
-Very, my lord.

Quite right too.

Glad to have you with us.

Thank you, my lord.

What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

Twelve, sir.

Right.

Thank you, my lord.

-This pitcher seems out of place here.
-Dining room. Well spotted.

-Hello, William, how are you?
-Good day, Miss Kenton.

I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

Beg your pardon?

They might cheer things up for you.

That's very kind of you.

If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

Thank you...

...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

I should think I was
addressing your father.

There are no other Williams
in this house.

True.

May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

...Mr. Stevens Sr.
to distinguish him from myself.

So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

...someone such as my father.

It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

...by one such as myself.

My father is a person from whom...

...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

...what things might I learn from him?

I might point out that you're...

...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
is very good at his job...

...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

-Of course.
-Thank you.

If you will please excuse me.

Oh, well.

My compliments to cook.

What a lovely piece of crackling.

I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

Sprouts "are" done, not "is" done.

Isn't that right, George?

Yes, Mr. Stevens.

Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

...at your age for the sake
of my education.

I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

The definition from our quarterly
The Gentlemen's Gentleman:.

A great butler must be possessed
of dignity--

In keeping with his position.

There was this English butler
in lndia.

One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

A tiger.

Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

"Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

"I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?"

They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

They don't think nothing of it.
In lndia, they're used to anything.

When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

...he says, cool as a cucumber:

"Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

I'll repeat it. "There will be
no discernible traces left...

...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

-Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
-Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

For you, Mr. Stevens.

Thank you.

It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

Thank you, Miss Kenton.

Put Mr. Stevens Sr.'s plate
with cook to keep it warm.

Yes, Miss Kenton.

Thank you.

Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

My dustpan?

You've left it on the landing.

-I haven't used a dustpan.
-Really? It must be somebody else.

-I don't follow you.
-My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

Morning, sir.

I've invited Giscard Dupont D'lvry
as the French delegate.

He'll never come!

I just had word of his acceptance.

Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

It's not the English way.

No, it is not.

This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

...in the friendly and relaxed...

...atmosphere of one's home.

We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

And that of the Germans.

I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

And what about the Jews?

Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

...with the one outside the door?

-Chinaman?
-Yes.

The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

I'm busy at the moment.

Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

-I'll look into the matter later.
-You think it's a fantasy?

A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

I shall wait.

Outside.

Look!

-ls that not the wrong Chinaman?
-I am very busy.

Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

Look at it and tell me the truth.

Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

And I would ask you...

...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

It is a small mistake.

Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

Let me pass.

Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

-You can't talk to me like this.
-I'm afraid I must.

I'm giving you serious advice.

Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

I thank you for your advice.

Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

I never meant to keep you
from your business.

Thank you.

It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

-...your Frenchman. What's his name?
-Giscard Dupont D'lvry.

We also expect the
American delegate...

...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

Who is he, this American?

He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

-Meatpacking?
-Trolley cars?

Or dry goods?

What are dry goods?

Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

It's old Mr. Stevens!

Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

The silver!
The silver!

Oh, my lord. Sorry.

You'll be all right.

Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

-He tripped with the tray.
-I saw it from the window.

This has never happened before.

-May I telephone the doctor?
-Yes, do.

-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

Your father feeling better?

He's made a full recovery.

Good.

We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

-I mean, your father collapsing.
-lndeed not, my lord.

And it could happen anywhere.

At any time.

The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

-We are well prepared, my lord.
-I'm sure you are.

What happens within this house
could have...

...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

It means a great deal.

And it means a great deal
to me personally.

I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

...Iike gentlemen.

The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

Yes, a liar, Stevens.

Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

Killed himself.

Shot himself in a railway carriage.

Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

...a fair chance.

So this conference is crucial...

...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

There's no question
of your father leaving.

You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

Good.

I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

Thank you, sir.

I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

-Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
-Smarten up. Look sharp.

Good morning.

Good morning.

I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

I've been up for two hours.

-That's not much sleep.
-It's all the sleep I need.

I've come to talk to you.

Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

-I'll come straight to the point.
-Do, and be done with it.

Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

We must all put our best foot forward.

Because of Father's recent accident...

...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

I've waited at table every day...

...for the last 54 years.

It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

Look, I fell...

...because of those paving stones.

They're crooked.

Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

You will read the revised list
of your duties.

Get those stones put right.

You don't want those "gentlemen of
stature" breaking their necks.

No, indeed, I don't.

What is it?

You have what we can call
a roving commission.

In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

...within certain limits, of course.

Now, here are the mops, and....
Here.

-Are these me mops?
-Right. Your brushes.

And me brushes?

-And me mops.
-That's right.

What do you want me to do with them?

I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

If I find any dust or dirt...

...I go over them with this mop.

That's right.

Now, I suggest you start off...

...with the brasses on the doors.

There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

And then there's this door here....

Here's your polish.
And duster.

History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

Each and every one of you...

...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

Imagine yourself
the head of a battalion...

...even if it is only filling
the hot-water bottles.

Each one has his own
particular duty...

...or her particular duty,
as the cap fits.

Polished brass, brilliant silver,
mahogany shining like a mirror.

That is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors...

... to let them know
they are in England...

...where order and tradition
still prevail.

Thank you, Brian.

Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

Thank you, Stevens.

I feel very responsible for the boy.

He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

And now that he's gone, well...

...I feel in place of a father to him.

I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

I'm sorry to bring this up...

...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

You are familiar with
the facts of life?

-My lord?
-The facts of life.

Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

Let me put my cards on the table.

I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

...but someone has to tell him.

In a way, it would be easier for you.

Less awkward.

I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

I shall do my best.

I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

God! Stevens!

Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

If I may, I'll come to the point.

Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

...or the shrubs, the bees....

I've not seen any bees.

-It's not the best time to see them.
-What, the bees?

What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

...in the surroundings.

I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

...because it's worrying....

Dupont D'lvry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

-M. Dupont D'lvry has arrived?
-Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

...as you put it most admirably...

...the glories of nature.

But it must wait for another occasion.

I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

-Fish?
-I know all about fish.

Freshwater and salt.

All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

Excuse me. I had no idea that
Monsieur Dupont D'lvry had arrived.

Thank you.

May I be of assistance, sir?

Oh, the butler.

I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

How do you do? But I speak English.

Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

Could we speak privately soon?

Yes, of course.

But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

I had already seen
the Tower of London.

I've discovered that things
are not moving...

...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

Not a prostrate nation...

...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

Those who've been in Germany...

...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

--to assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

...and universal military service
for German youth.

If we, in postwar Europe....

I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

Follow me, sir.

Excuse me.

-We have to talk.
-This way, sir.

My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

Vanity.

We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

Please come this way, gentlemen.

Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet-- shoe?

-Yes, of course.
-Take it off.

What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service--

-Sorry, sir.
-I'll manage.

What?

Your father's been taken ill, sir.

-Where?
-Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

Here, let me help you with that.

Thank you.

Thank you, Charles.

Take a basin of hot water and salts...

...to Mr. D'lvry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

-Yes, Mr. Stevens.
-Good. Do it.

Father?

I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

Thank you, Miss Kenton.

Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

How old is he? 70, 72?

-75, sir.
-I see.

-lf he deteriorates, let me know.
-I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

More haste, less speed.

There's something missing.

What is it?

-The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
-Good.

Well observed.

Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

Good.

Glass first, and then....

Is everything in hand downstairs?

We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

You can imagine the kitchen.

-But is everything in hand?
-Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

Are you feeling any better?

There's something I have to tell you.

I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

Jim...

...I fell out of love
with your mother.

I loved her once.

The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

A good son.

Proud of you.

I hope I've been a good father.

I tried me best.

You better get down there...

...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

Go on.

Go on!

We'll talk in the morning.

On the last day of our conference...

...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

Goodwill for Germany.

And with tears in my eyes...

...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

...that Germany needs peace...

...and desires only peace.

Peace with England...

...and peace with France.

Thank you very much.

I, too, have been impressed...

...yes, deeply impressed...

...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

Unlike our American colleague...

...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

And whether we are French
or English or ltalian or German...

...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

Indeed.

Impressed, or I may say touched...

...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

...to change my country's policy...

...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

...but is now,
I may venture to say...

...our friend.

Ladies and gentlemen...

...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

...because some prices,
you may find...

...are too outrageously high to pay.

But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

But...

...now, excuse me, I must say this...

...you are, all of you, amateurs.

And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

Europe has become the arena of
Realpolitik, the politics of reality.

If you like, real politics.

What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

...to the professionals.

Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

...on our last evening together.

But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

Oh, I see.

I'm so very sorry.

I wish there was something
I could say.

Will you come up and see him?

Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

No. Of course.

I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

About nature.

You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

Yes, sir. Indeed.

As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

I harboured quite a passion for them.

I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

You all right?

I'm perfectly all right.

Not feeling unwell?

No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

Wonderful!

What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

Very nice.

I hope there's no hard feelings.

Oh, my dear good chap.

I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

Anyway, thank you.

Excuse me.

You all right?

Yes, perfect, my lord.

You coming down
with a cold or something?

It's been a long day.

It's been a hard day for both of us.

Well done.

My condolences.

It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

Thank you for telling me.

There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

...in need of attention.

Urgent?

His feet.

Feet?

-I'll take you to him.
-lf it's urgent.

It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

My condolences.

Thank you. That is most kind of you.

Good afternoon.

My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

-I'll just check for you, sir.
-James Stevens.

-I'd like two apples, please.
-There you are, Mr. Stevens.

-You are touring in these parts?
-I'm on my way to Clevedon.

-How much is that?
-That'll be threepence, please.

And you'd be coming from...?

-Oxfordshire.
-Whereabouts?

-Sorry?
-Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

Darlington.

That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

...of Nazi, got us in the war?

I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

I didn't know the former owner.

Your change.

I should be glad to meet you at the
Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.

We'll have such a lot to talk about,
and I'll have many questions.

Except for you, I've lost touch with
all our friends at Darlington Hall.

But that's no wonder.

It was long ago and a lot
has happened in between.

Who could keep track of all the people
His Lordship once employed?

My lord, you rang?

-Have the young German ladies arrived?
-They're outside.

I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

-They do speak excellent English.
-Good. Well, ask them to come in.

This is Elsa and this is lrma.

I'm asking about their journey.

It was long, my lord.

I asked if they like the weather.

We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

Our parents are very grateful.

Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

-Won't you?
-lndeed, my lord.

Welcome to Darlington Hall.

-Thank you, my lord.
-Thank you, my lord.

Will there be anything else?

Sir Geoffrey.

Good to see you.

How do you do?

Well, come in.

-Mr. Benn.
-Mr. Stevens.

Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

-Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
-I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

-You haven't changed one bit.
-I'll let you get on.

-Perhaps we'll meet later.
-I hope so.

But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country--

You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

And everyone's kept in line.

No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

It is internally diseased.

I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

I'm afraid there may be.

You've made a cozy little nest here.

Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

...until he has done all he can...

...to be of service to his employer.

This assumes that one's employer...

...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

...but in moral stature.

And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has "moral stature"?

I wish I could be sure.

But I'm not.

I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

I hear nothing.

Listen.

That's so touching, isn't it?

To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

It's fresh soda.

Would you be joining us?

Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

Good night.

-Good night, Mr. Stevens.
-Good night, Miss Kenton.

Good-looking woman.

It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

I handed in my own notice
six months later.

I'd be lost without her.

A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

-Good morning.
-My lord.

"We do the Jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of Christ...

...is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them.

Though He apparently sprang
from their midst...

...He embodies the negation of their
whole nature.

The Jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are.

This demonstration of the cleft that
separates us Europeans from the Jew...

...is not given in order
to let religious prejudice...

...with its dangerous bias,
settle the matter...

...but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures...

...reveals a real gulf. "

We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

We do.

Two housemaids, Elsa and lrma.

You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

Let them go, my lord?

It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

You must see the whole thing
in context.

I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

May I say...

...they work extremely well.

They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

There are larger issues at stake.

I'm sorry, but there it is.

They're Jews.

Yes, my lord.

I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!
