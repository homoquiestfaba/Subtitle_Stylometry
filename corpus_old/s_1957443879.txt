<i>â™ª ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª mmm â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª there's a magic in the air</i>
<i> this Christmas â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª it's a picture perfect</i>

<i> â™ª you can see it</i>
<i> on the smiling faces â™ª</i>

That's great. Put your head up
a little bit. Smile.

<i> â™ª Feels like all your dreams â™ª</i>

<i> - â™ª could come your way â™ª</i>
you're incredible.

Can I get the 16-35?

You're doing really good.

Thanks, Tyler.
Mm-hmm.

So please tell me we all
get a pair of those jeans

when we leave.

I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

Look at that.
You're selling these jeans.

Ms. Wilks, can I get you
a cup of coffee or anything?

No, thank you. I just came by
to see how it's all going.

Great work, everyone!

We got it.

Leila, I'm so glad you made it.

'Course I did. Hi.

Wanna check out the previews?

Of course.

What do you think?
Oh, wow.

You are the queen
of these clothing spreads.

Thanks. That means a lot,
coming from you.

That is why you are<i> style source</i>
<i> magazine's</i> go-to freelancer

for all fashion ads.

You know, I am really glad
you brought that up.

I heard that the magazine

is hiring a full-time
staff photographer.

That we are, yeah.

Iris is looking to hire
someone in the new year.

Really? Leila, could you
recommend me to Iris

for that job?

Gaby, you are so talented.

From the moment that you
took my class back at nyu,

I always knew that
you had an amazing eye.

Thanks.

But your experience is...

Strictly in fashion,

and, well, we're looking for
a more rounded photographer

for the staff position.

Your portfolio is lacking
a certain emotional component.

Uh...
A warmth.

Warmth.

Yeah, you see,

every photograph,
even in fashion photography,

it should tell
an emotional story.

Yeah, I mean, that's...
I'm sorry, Gaby.

I just don't think you're ready
for the range that we demand

of our full-time photographers.

We do have an amazing mascara
campaign coming up though,

and that is all yours.

Okay!
Okay?

Yeah, that's awesome.
Okay.

Mm-mm.

Leila, wait!

Um, what can I do to show you
that I can learn?

I can grow. I can have the range
that you're looking for.

Actually, there is something
that might get you moving

in the right direction.
Yeah?

My old friend, bill Peters,

he runs a Christmas photography
retreat in the rocky mountains.

Wait, what now?

It's this five-day
intensive course

all about exploring
Christmas through photography.

And you think that would
prep me for<i> style source?</i>

There's no better way
to understand

warmth and emotion
in photography

than learning how to capture
Christmas through a lens.

Oh.

Um, I've gotta get to a shoot
across town,

but I'll send you
the information.

You should check it out.
Right.

And, uh, you build
a better portfolio there,

I'll consider talking to Iris.

Okay.

Rocky mountains?

<i> â™ª [Jazz]</i>

A photography retreat?

Aren't these things for like
amateur hobbyists?

Not only that,
it's a Christmas-themed one.

Yikes.

I know, but I want
the staff job so badly.

Then go shoot the best
Christmas photo thingy,

and Leila will have
to recommend you.

You know, Christmas
isn't exactly my thing.

Oh, which reminds me.

Both your mom and dad called
during the shoot.

They wanna know whose house
you'll be at for the holidays.

And the ping pong begins.

Maybe running off
to the mountains

isn't such a bad thing.

So I'm guessing that means

you didn't get an invite
to Iris Holmes' Christmas party?

You think the editor-in-chief
of<i> style source</i> knows my name?

That's the whole point
of going on this retreat,

would be for Leila
to put me on her radar.

Oh, I know,
but just imagine.

Spending Christmas night
brushing shoulders

with fashion's finest.

Speaking of fine fashion...


You are the best!

Oh, my god! Thank you!

See? Maybe Christmas
is your thing, after all,

because this is
the best gift ever!

[Phone ringing]

Pine falls crafts.
How may I help you?

Hi. Uh, I'm not sure
if I have the right number,

but, um, it looks like
I'm going to be in pine falls

for a photography retreat
from December 18th to the 23rd,

and I was hoping to reserve
the cabin I saw online.

Splendid! We're actually right
across from the town gallery.

Ah, we just adore bill.

In fact, we go to
the retreat showcase every year.

<i> Now, let me see.</i>
<i> How does this work?</i>

Oh.

Hey, you know what?

My husband usually deals with
the website booking,

but I'll just take down
all your information for him.

Well, sounds good.

<i> I arrive on the 18th.</i>

<i> Let me give you</i>
<i> my full name and number.</i>

<i> It's Gabrielle Jones...</i>

<i> â™ª [Upbeat]</i>


<i> â™ª Mm, yeah â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª mm-hmm â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª everybody gather round â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª the season of joy</i>

<i> â™ª the holidays</i>

Can I help you?

Oh, hey!
Huh!

Who are you?
Well, who are you?

Uh, what are you
doing here?

Well, I'm clearly
taking a shower.

But no, what are you
doing here?

I rented this cabin.

No, no, no, no.

You see, I rented this cabin.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Okay, is this 23 oak drive?

Well, last time that I checked.

Oh, yeah, I rented this cabin
for five nights.

Oh, okay, I get it.

This is one of those welcome to
pine falls hazing things, right?

Right guys, huh?

What? No.

Oh.

Let me call the woman
who booked this,

and I'm sure we can
figure this all out.

Well, I'm going to call
the gentleman who booked it,

and show you that you are
clearly mistaken.

Well, I think you'll see
that you're the mistaken one.

Do you mind if I just
put clothes on first and...

Please.

Okay.

<i> Pine falls crafts.</i>
<i> How may I help you?</i>

Hi, Fran. This is Gaby.

Um, there seems to be a man here
who thinks he rented this cabin.

I talked to
someone named Robert.

<i> Yeah, he gave me</i>
<i> the entry code.</i>

Oh, dear. Robert,
did you get my post-it note

about the young lady coming for
the photography retreat.

No. Did you get mine
about the young man?

There seems to have been
a slight mix-up.

We'll be right over.

Oh, no.
I don't...

Hung up. Great

since I was here first,

I'm sure they can help you
get settled somewhere else.

Or... and this is
just a thought here...

Um, you could go
somewhere else.

Yeah, see,
I'm here from New York.

I'm a fashion photographer.

Yeah, I'm actually here visiting
for a photography retreat.

As am I.

No kidding.

Sean Daniels.
<i> Wildlife weekly.</i>

Gaby Jones.

Wildlife photography.
Interesting.

Fashion photography.

Less interesting.

Hot chocolate?
[Water running]

I was just about to make some
before you broke in.

I had the code.

No, thanks, all right? I'll just
wait for them to get here.

Suit yourself.


So have you been
to this retreat before?

No. First time.

I see. You know,
I've wanted to come for years,

but somehow I'm always
out on assignment.

Last year at this time,
I believe it was...

Ah. The Siberian tigers.

Oh, exciting.

Oh, very.

Mm-mm-mm. Are you sure
you don't want any?

I mean, it's absolutely
delicious.

I got the cocoa
from when I was in Ghana,

shooting the patas monkeys.

It's too sweet for me.
Mmm.

[Vehicle approaches]
Oh, good, they're here.

Settle this once and for all.

We brought you guys
some groceries.

Thought it was the least
we could do.

Oh, that's so nice of you.

Extremely nice,
but I think the issue here

is that we rented the cabin
at the same time.

Correct that does seem to be
what happened.

Yeah. Watch out for the mud.

We haven't had any snow yet
this winter,

but we've had plenty of rain.

[Door opens]

Wait.

We are so sorry about
this whole thing.

I'm Fran, by the way.

This is my husband Robert,
Gaby: Hello.

Who is the one most at fault
for this mix-up.

Gaby.
See, look,

this is the first year
that we've rented the cabin

using an online website.

I don't know if you know this,

but sometimes those things
can be really confusing.

I thought Robert had it handled,
but clearly...

You know, these mistakes
can easily happen.

Um, my only concern
is what happens now?

I think we should just go with
who reserved the cabin first.

I know I made the reservation
months ago.

Now, unfortunately, there really
isn't any record of that.

I didn't know if you liked
the low-fat yogurt,

so I went with the regular.
Oh.


Oh!
Mm-hmm.

This hot chocolate looks good.

Please, help yourself.

Robert: You know, the bathroom,

well, there's really only enough
hot water for one person.

So what you're saying is

really just one person
should be staying here.

Or you could both stay here.

The couch is very comfortable.
Yes, yes.

Oh, no, I don't think so.
No, mm-mm.

Look, I know some people
who work at the inn.

I'll ask around tomorrow.

But the town is pretty full.

Can you two make it one night?
It will be fun.

You can make a new friend.
Yeah.

[Fran chuckles]

You know, I checked,

and there isn't any availability
within a 20-mile radius.

I don't really think
we have a choice.

Well, then it's settled.

Yeah, you guys both stay here,

and if something
opens up, great.

And if not, we'll...
We'll give you a discount.

And...

No more computers for us.


Well, we'll leave you to it.
Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Both: Dibs on the bed.

Gaby: Heads.

What?

Best out of three.
No. No, no, no.

That couch looks great though.

Fine, fine.

Oh, I call the basement though.

You'd rather sleep
in the basement?

No. No, it's for
a makeshift darkroom.

I'll just clear
some of the boxes out of there.

Wait, you shooting on film?

Oh, I always shoot on film
whenever possible.

I thought you said you're
a professional photographer.

I am.

Are you also
a time traveler from 1985?

Okay, take it easy.

It's the most authentic version
of our art form.

Yeah, but there's a reason
our art form

transitioned to digital.

Well, not everyone sees it
that way.

It's why we went from web plates
to Kodachrome to instamatics

to ektar and now
to digital sensors, right?

'Cause the the point
of photography

is quality and speed.

Are you kidding me?

Film provides a way higher
dynamic range.

I get more accurate skin tones,

not to mention I pick up
way more details

that are missed
on digital photography.

I can take an infinite
amount of pictures

on a lighter-weight camera.

Well, I have to put more thought
and purpose into my shots

because they actually matter.

I can edit
directly on my camera.

I have complete control with my
chemical process in my darkroom.

I have modern lenses.

I don't have to rely on
a digital representation

of my environment.

A digital representation
of your environment?

Art is supposed to
connect you to your senses.

Oh, okay, I don't even know why
I'm having this debate with you

because clearly digital is what
makes sense in this day and age.

Agree to disagree.

Okay, I'm going to bed.

Well, you enjoy
that giant cozy bed.

Enjoy that couch.

I will.
Good.

And I've endured way worse,
by the way.

You know, one time I had
to sleep on a rock ledge

just to get the perfect shot
of a mountain goat, so...

Of course you did.

Mm-hmm.
[Humming merrily]

Oh, it's cute up here!

[Sean humming "jingle bells"]

[Humming continues]


[Drawer closes]

[Clattering continues]

[Humming continues]

[Humming continues]

What are you doing?

Oh, good morning!
Did you sleep well?

I didn't wake you, did I?

Actually, you kinda did.

What is all this?

I was cleaning out the basement,

you know, for my dark room,

and I found all these
Christmas decorations.

And you just decided
to help yourself.

Mm-hmm. I figured
we're at a Christmas retreat,

maybe it'll help put us
in the right mindset.

Hmm. That explains the outfit.

Aha, so you noticed
my Santa Claus print pajamas.

Super cozy.

Is that a child's
extra-extra-extra large?

For your information,

they make Christmas pajamas
in adult sizes.

And you might wanna
look into it

because for someone in fashion,
your robe is kinda blah.

I need coffee.

Oh, come on, you sure you don't
wanna help decorate, hmm?


Um, I'm not a super big fan
of Christmas.

You do realize we're about
to meet a bunch of people

who are here for
a Christmas photography retreat.

Key word here being
"Christmas."

Yeah, well,
um, if you must know,

I actually signed up
because I'm trying to get a job

as a staff photographer
at<i> style source magazine.</i>

So, wait, you're not
just here for fun?

No.

And being awoken by a stranger
I'm cohabitating with

in a cabin I rented

because he feels the need
to decorate at 7 A.M.

Is not exactly
my idea of fun.

Okay, fair enough.

Why are you here?

I mean, are you just
doing this for fun?

Of course.
I love photography.

I love Christmas.

You know, I finally got
some free time,

and before I head to my sisters
for the holidays,

this retreat
was a gift to myself.

Oh.

All right, I get it.

You're super big
into Christmas.

Look at me.

Uh, well,
I'm gonna get dressed.

I, uh, I don't wanna be late
for our first day.

Gaby, we should leave now!

I know.
I'll be right there.

Sort of blah.

What does he know?

Coming!

[Bell rings]

Oh, donuts! You want one?

Uh, no, thanks.
I don't eat breakfast.

Gaby?

Dani? Hi! Oh, my gosh!

It's been way too long.

I know! I-I can't believe
you're here.

Same. Um, are you doing
the retreat?

I am.

Really.
Yeah.

I didn't think
it was your thing.

Hey, babe.
Hey.

Gaby, this is
my girlfriend, Amelia.

Amelia, this is Gaby.

We went to nyu together.
Photography majors.

Oh, that's so cool.

Nice to meet you.
You too.

Is that your person?

No, no, not at all.
I met him yesterday

when it turned out
my rental was double-booked.

My name is Sean.
So nice to meet you both.

Uh, you two wouldn't
happen to know

of a spare hotel room
in town, would you?

I'm sorry. We drove.

Last year, we converted
a school bus into a tiny home.

Yeah, we drive around
the country now,

taking photographs
for our postcard website.

Wow, that's adventurous.

It's a far cry
from our model shoot days

when we interned together.

Yeah, um, that...
That wasn't my scene, you know?

Are you still in
the fashion world?

Very much so.

It's all I've done
since we graduated.

I'm trying to get staffed
at<i> style source magazine.</i>

Oh, I love that magazine.

Me too.

Welcome! Welcome!

Please, everyone grab
another donut, some more coffee

and take a seat.

It's time to get
this retreat started!

Yeah!

It's so good to see you.
You too.

Do you wanna sit with us?
We'd love to.

My name is bill Peters.

Some of you might know my work.

I was pretty busy in
the New York photography scene

for most of my life.

Worked for the<i> times,</i>
the<i> journal,</i>

traveling all over, covering
almost anything and everything

and missing
every single Christmas.

Finally, one day it hit me.

Taking pictures
wasn't fun anymore.

I lost my passion,
and that broke my heart.

So I quit and moved out here.

I opened this gallery,

so I could help
people like you

reconnect with
the magic of photography

through the beauty of Christmas
in pine falls.

Each day, I'll give you
a Christmas assignment,

some specific, some general,

and I'll be here for guidance,
tips and questions,

but I want you to go out there

and explore what Christmas
really means to you.

Every night, I want you to look
over your photos from the day

and pick your favorites
to submit.

On the last day of the retreat
is our big showcase

right here in the studio,

where we can all
comment, critique

and appreciate
each other's work.

Sounds like it's designed around
shooting digital.

Uh, question.
Yes.

There are no rules for what
we have to shoot on, right?

Personally, I feel as though
film is the best medium

for Christmas photography.

Go for it!
Film, digital, pin boxes,

whatever you feel
best captures Christmas.

Oh, and I've learned
over the years

that it's best to split up
into smaller groups

as you go out
on each assignment.

The chairs are arranged in rows
for a reason.

Where you are sitting
is your group

for the rest of the retreat.

Nice! We're gonna be together.

Would you look at that.

Good thing I sat down
next to you guys.

That's great.

We're kicking things off today
with the assignment

"Christmas in nature."

Christmas in nature.

What is that?

Shh.

Bill: Some lighting tips
and tricks

for shooting outside.

It's so good to see you.

This whole thing
is not my forte.

I really just want to show Leila
that I've got what it takes.

Leila was our teacher at nyu,

and she's the photo editor
at<i> style source.</i>

With her recommendation,

I'd be a real shoo-in
for that staff job.

Hmm.

All right,
one peppermint mocha,

one Santa's
vanilla spiced latte,

one Christmas caramel
macchiato...

Thank you.

And a regular coffee,

nothing else in it.

I don't know how
you drink it like that.

It's way bitter.

I just don't like
all the floof.

That's the best part!

Agreed! She has no idea
what she's missing out on.

I don't like toppings
on my pizza either.

Who hurt you?

Okay, let me know if you guys
need anything else, all right?

I like him.

So...

Let's get started.

Um, Christmas in nature.
Any ideas?

Well, we could see if there's
some pear trees around,

throw a couple partridges
in there, and boom!

You got yourself
Christmas in nature.

How about you, Gaby?

What's your favorite thing
to do outside during Christmas?

Go inside and get warm.

Gaby doesn't like Christmas.

I didn't say I didn't like
Christmas, okay?

I said I'm not
a Christmas person.

Well, that's funny
because you got mad at me

for decorating our cabin
for Christmas.

First of all,
it's not our cabin,

and secondly,
he started decorating at 7 A.M.

While I was still sleeping.

Okay, well, excuse me
for being a morning guy.

What if we just hike around
and see what we find?

Um, you mean just go around
and shooting things?

That is a great idea.

You know, some of
the best photos I've taken

have been completely
on the fly.

Huh.
Yeah.

Okay, I guess. I mean,
if you guys want to wing it.

Um, but first could we stop by
Fran and Robert's craft shop?

I wanna see if they had any luck
finding you someplace to stay.

Well, you mean someplace
for you to stay.

Cheers! To Christmas in nature.

Cheers!
Cheers.

Ah, welcome.

How's the retreat so far?

So good we're actually
about to go

on a pine falls walkabout now.

Fran, Robert,
this is Dani and Amelia.

They're also with the retreat.

How wonderful.
So nice to meet you.

How was the cabin last night?
Warm enough?

Great. Slept like a baby.

Uh, actually, that's why
we wanted to come by.

Any luck finding
anywhere else?

Oh, yeah! I talked to my pals
at the inn and the b&b.

And?

And...

And that's a no-go.

All full.

That's okay. I've hung up
some Christmas cheer,

and we can make it work.

This stuff is so cute.

Let's grab some things.

You never know what you
can work into a shoot.

Well, I don't think we need...
Oh!

And we're grabbing things.

You okay?
Totally.

Actually, there's a rock
in my shoe.

Hey, can I tell you something?
I'm dying to tell someone.

Yeah, go for it.

At some point on this trip,

I, uh, I plan on
proposing to a Amelia.

Wait, really?
Congratulations. When?

I-I don't know.
I really want it to be perfect.

We met two years ago
on Christmas,

so no better time to do it
than now.

Oh, that is such a sweet idea.

Well, if you need any help,
I mean...

I have no expertise
in the romantic arts,

but I do take pictures.

Thank you.

Just keep it between us for now.
I really want to surprise her.

You sure you're okay?

Let me tell you,

whoever said ankle boots
were comfortable

never hiked
in the rocky mountains.

Hey, Amelia!

Do you have an extra pair
of hiking boots in your bag?

I sure do.

Ah! Thank heavens!

These shoes are killing me.

How could you come
to the mountains

and not pack hiking boots?

I didn't think we were actually
walking on the mountains.

Amelia: Ta-Da! Here you go.
Think these should fit you.

Dani: Check it out, guys.

Angel lake?

What could that be?

This is so beautiful.

Look at the way the light
is hitting the lake.

We got to shoot this.

No wonder they call it
angel lake.

It's like angels are literally
shining down on it.

[Sean humming]

What song is that?

"Angels we've heard on high."

Just providing a little
atmospheric music.

[Sean continues humming]

<i> â™ª Gloria â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª in excelsis deo â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Gloria â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª in excelsis deo â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª [vocalizing]</i>

Oh, push in over here.

<i> â™ª</i>


<i> â™ª See him in a manger laid â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª whom the choirs</i>
<i> of angels praise â™ª</i>

Gotcha.

<i>â™ª Mary, Joseph, lend your aid â™ª</i>

[Funny accent] Now, next one,
you take my good side, please.

I prefer straight on,
not profile.

Feels like we found
hidden treasure.

Do you think here would be
a good place to propose?

Don't tell anyone,
but I have a ring on me,

and I want to propose
to Dani this week.

When the right moment
presents itself, I'm ready,

so I'm on the hunt
for a great spot.

Say no more.

I'll keep my eyes peeled
for the perfect time and place.

Okay, it's a secret though,
so you can't tell anyone.

[Clears throat]

Man, I wish I had my bounce,

then I could get the light to
reflect just the way I want it.

You do realize the assignment
is Christmas in nature, right?

I know, but in the studio,
I have so much control.

I can make sure everything is
exactly the way I want it.

See, that's what I hate about
studio shoots.

They're way too controlled.

Now, this? This is the perfect
chance for you to practice

all the things that we learned
in our natural lighting class.

Huh!
Okay, okay.

Maybe I'll try a different angle

and see if I can get the sun
to give me some kick.

There you go. Now you're putting
those old photo skills to use.

[Camera clicks]

Look! I got it.

Absolutely beautiful.

[Gaby humming
"angels we have heard on high"]

[Continues humming]

[Sean clears throat]

Stuck in my head.

Christmas is contagious.

[Doorbell rings]

Who is that?

Oh, I ordered us some pizza.

Don't worry.
Half of it's plain cheese.

Oh, that's so nice.

This might come as a shock
to you, but I'm a nice guy.

I never said you weren't.

That's okay.
You can admit it.

You don't like me very much.

Okay, yes, I was bothered
when I first met you,

but that's because
the private cabin I had rented,

turned out to not be private.

And you felt the same way,
as I recall.

True.

Are you just gonna
let the grease

just drip on down your arm?

It's a plate. Please.

So you're gonna be
that kind of roommate, huh?

I got it.

Mmm!

So, perfectionist Gaby,

what made you want to be
a photographer?

I guess...

My love of photography started

the Christmas my grandma
gave me my first camera.

And it was a film camera,
if you must know.

As it should be.

She said pictures
are the best way

to share your life
with others.

I've always kept that with me.

See? That's a good answer.

Unfortunately,
she passed away when I was 13,

right before my parents split.

But I've always
kept that camera.

I still have it, actually,
somewhere.

I know she's proud
you kept at it.

Turned it into a profession.

I hope so.

So you ready for the toss?
What?

No, I won.

That was last night.

Okay, wait.
That was for the whole week.

No. No, I did not agree
to that.

You see, we're gonna
do this every night

because this is fair.

Fine.

Gaby: Heads.

Oh, yeah! Uhh! Yeah!

No early morning decorating,
okay? Thanks.

You know, you are very lucky

that I'm adaptable
to different sleep environments.

Oh, and by the way, I let you
win all these coin tosses.

How do you let someone
win a coin toss?

Easy. You just...

Here you go.

Just in case you need it.

Today's assignment is
"Christmas past."

One of the reasons why
I fell in love with pine falls

was its history of making
Christmas a town priority.

In fact, in 1870,

Charles Shepard,
the mayor of pine falls,

wrote into law that
the entire month of December

was to be made a town holiday.

No school, no work,
only Christmas celebration.

In fact, the Shepard house
is now a museum.

Every December, they decorate it
exactly the way it used to be.

I highly recommend stopping by
as you explore the town today.

This is impressive.

It feels like
we went through a time warp.

Now, this is Christmas.

Is that Robert?

Hey, folks!

Robert! Looking good!


You work here too?
Volunteer.

Yes, I'm a descendant
of Charles Shepard.

Oh.

Hey, you guys wanna
go for a ride?

Ooh!

Um, Dani and Amelia
should go first.

How about it?
Sounds lovely.

Perfect. Follow me.

Those two.

Okay, let's start clicking.

Oh, yeah.

[Sean chuckles]


Look at these decorations.

They're so fragile.

Says they were made in 1848.

Wow.

So, um, what was the deal
with the carriage?

Well, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

but I think I know what's gonna
happen on that carriage ride.

Same. How do you know?

Well, don't tell Dani,

but Amelia is planning
to propose on this trip.

No, Dani is planning to propose
to Amelia on this trip.

Oh, that's so sweet.

I wonder who's gonna
do it first?

Gaby: Oh, hello.

Well, I think Dani's
overthinking it, you know?

She just wants everything
to be so perfect.

Ah, someone who wants
everything to be perfect.

I wonder why
that sounds familiar.

What?

You with your pictures.

Right, but I work for
a magazine, you know?

Things, they have
to be perfect.

When you take pictures for
yourself, that doesn't matter.

Perfection doesn't even exist.

Look at how the candlelight
is shining off of the garland.

Very nicely done.

I wasn't even going for that.
You see?

That's the best part.

So let me see some of yours.

Oh, I have...

That's right, I can't.

Hey, guys,
you have to go on a ride.

The views are great!

Huh.

And?
How'd it go?

Well, head's up.
Robert's a bit chatty.

Yeah, I couldn't even
get a word in.

Gaby, Sean?

Your turn.

Was it worth it?

Yes. The ride's beautiful.

Oh.

Have fun.

They're so cute.

[Cameras clicking]

It wasn't till
after the civil war

that Charles Shepard
even came out this far west.

[Horse whinnies]

It was love at first sight
though.

He moved his wife and kids out
and built that house.

Hey, Robert, you know, it's
kinda hard to hear back here,

what with the the wind
and the horses.

Oh, of course, of course.

Just enjoy the ride!

[Horse whinnies]

How about you?

Anyone planning to
propose to you anytime soon?

Are you asking me
if I'm single?

Uh, no, I'm just...
Just making conversation.

Well...

No, actually.

The last few years have been
about trying to get hired

as a staff photographer.

All work and no play.
Got it.

What about you?

Gaby, are you asking me
if I am single?

Oh, my gosh.

Ah, I travel too much.

Never in one place long enough
to make something last.

Well, I guess
we're married to these.

I think we just found something
we have in common.


Are you really? Robert?
No.


Hey, Sean, can I get your
thoughts on some of these?

Of course.
I'll just... okay.

Gaby.

Come here.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah?

So? What's the story?

Um, the carriage
had amazing views.

No, come on. You and Sean.

There is no story.
I barely know him.

Okay, so being stuck in a cabin
with a sweet, single, hot guy

hasn't caused any thoughts?

I don't know.
I'm not thinking about all that.

I mean, I'm here to show
that I have depth.

Okay, yeah, I'll drop it.

What about you?

You haven't proposed at the lake
during the sunset

or now at the carriage drive?

Yeah, uh, it just hasn't been
the right moment.

Just...

Don't overthink it.

Yeah.

You see this picture
I took of Sean?

Yeah.
It came out pretty good.

I think it's the first picture
I didn't overthink.

Yeah, you're right.

He does look really good
in that photo.

Amelia: Hi, babe.
Hey.

Oh, my god.
Look what I did.

Dude, you're so good.

I haven't taken pictures
of architecture like that

since college.

<i> I forgot how, um...</i>

Wonderfully challenging
it can be.

<i> I think the shot you took</i>
<i> of the carriage driver</i>

<i> looking back at the horse</i>
<i> is my favorite.</i>

Thanks. You know,
I still don't think

I fully captured
all of the energy

that that place had to offer.

Well, you're on the right track.

<i> You know, I have to be</i>
<i> honest with you.</i>

<i> When you first told me</i>
<i> about this retreat,</i>

<i>I thought it was the last thing</i>
<i> I needed, but, um...</i>

It's starting to surprise me.

Oh, gosh, when bill
first moved out there,

I thought he was nuts.

<i> Why leave a successful career</i>

<i> to go live in the mountains</i>
<i> and take pictures of trees?</i>

But then one year,
I signed up and, uh...

Yeah. I mean, I think you're
starting to feel what I did.

Does this mean you'll
throw my name in the ring

for the staff job?

Let's not jump the gun just yet.

<i> Iris has enough on her plate</i>
<i> with a Christmas party, and...</i>

Even though I do like
what I'm seeing,

it's only been two days.

<i> Keep going.</i>

And, uh, keep feeling.

I will do my best.

Talk soon.

Okay.

Mmm!

Sounded like that went well.

Eavesdrop much?

It's a small cabin.

Yeah, it was good.

I just wish she would
say the words:

"I'm recommending you
to Iris Holmes

for the photography staff job."

And who's Iris again?

Iris Holmes, the editor-in-chief
of<i> style source magazine.</i>

Right, yeah, um...

I don't know.

Maybe Leila doesn't want you
to focus on a recommendation.

What do you mean?
I don't know.

Maybe she wants you taking
pictures to take pictures

and not just to...

Uh...

Uh, I'm gonna...

I'll go...
Yeah.

Not just to get a job.

Maybe she wants you
to realize it's okay...

That the dishtowel
hangs out on the counter.

Yeah, you're so right.

That's what's holding her back,
you know?

My towel-folding skills.

You know,
if you fold it like this,

it actually dries faster.

And this way,
it's closer to where I am.

I had fun today.

Stop the presses!

Is our Grinch catching
the Christmas spirit?


Hey, I'm not a Grinch, okay?

I just forgot that
Christmas could be so...

Heartwarming.

How could you possibly forget
something like that?

I adored Christmas when
I was little, I really did.

Then my parents got divorced
and, you know,

Christmas became a battle.

Which house would I be at
on Christmas morning?

Which parent would I
inevitably disappoint?

Who would try to outdo who
for the best present?

And then as I got older,
you know, it's still the same.

Yeah, well, that doesn't sound
like fun at all.

Yeah, Christmas is
synonymous with stress,

letting a parent down.

Kids always think two families,
double the presents.

But no, it's not like that.

It's double the worries,
double the guilt

and double the expectations.

Well, makes sense why you're not
the biggest fan of the holiday.

You know, for me,
I always associate it

with opening presents
with my sister.

Yeah, we always open
at least one on Christmas Eve.

Oh, and we love...

Love...

To make reindeer food.

What's reindeer food?

Only the best thing
in the world.

My mom has this secret recipe
that my sister and I recreate.

Everyone always leaves
cookies out for Santa.

What about the reindeers
who do all the work?

They deserve a little bit
of love, am I right?

Yeah. That sounds like fun.

It is.

Now, my mom passed away
a few years ago,

but my sister and I
make sure to incorporate

all of her traditions.

That's so sweet.

You know, maybe that's
what you need,

some traditions of your own,

things to help you
appreciate Christmas,

separate from the things
that bring you stress.

Okay, you could be on
to something.

So you ready for the toss?

Uh, yeah, I'm on a streak.

Ends tonight. Here we go.

Tails.

Finally!
I get to sleep in a bed.

Mwah!

I got an idea.

Okay.

What do you say
I give you the bed again

if tomorrow you shoot
the whole day on film?

Wait, that's the deal
you wanna make?

Look, I'm trying
to help you reunite

with the roots
of your art form.

You know what? Bed.
I'll shoot on film tomorrow.

Now was that so hard?

Bed's all yours.

So... remember to protect
your shadows.

The highlight roll-off
in film

is way more generous
than digital.

I know how to use a film camera.

Look, I know, okay?

You just been using digital
for so long,

I want to make sure
you can still handle it.

I'm more worried about you.

There are a lot of buttons.

I use digital
at<i> wildlife weekly,</i>

thank you very much.


Um, I got it.
I meant to do that.

So, uh, we were thinking
that maybe today

with our assignment,
"Christmas wonder,"

maybe we could
break up into partners.

Yeah. Don't get us wrong.

We absolutely love
spending time with you guys,

but we were just thinking
it would be nice

to have some time together.

Oh, my gosh, yes.

Yeah. We can find some wonder
on our own, hmm?

Okay, great! You guys
have fun shooting today.

Bye.

Well, partner, it looks like
it's just you and me.

What a treat.

Hey, more coffee?

Oh, no.
No, thanks.

We should start figuring out
what we're gonna shoot today.

Maybe I can help.

Well, our assignment is
"Christmas wonder."

Huh. What does that mean?

It means we're looking for
awe or astonishment.

Did you really just search
for synonyms for "wonder?"

No.

Maybe.
Uh-huh.

Oh, if you guys want to see
something totally cool,

you should go check out
my neighbor's farm.

They go all out
decorating their barn,

and they have
the cutest baby goat.

Thank you, Chad.

Yeah, let me get that address.

Well, looks like
we're gonna see about a goat.

Gaby: Wow.

Sean: They went all out.

Yeah, they did.

Oh, man!

Oh, do you see the baby goat?

His name's dasher,
like the reindeer.

That is a perfect name.

Ten bucks says you can't name
the other eight reindeer.

Dasher, dancer, prancer, Vixen,
comet, cupid, Donner, blitzen

and Rudolph.

Oh, thank you.

He wants you
to take his picture.

That is a great idea.

Okay, just hold...
Just hold still.

There. Wait, wait, wait.

Now turn to the right,
little guy, please.

When you're
working with animals,

you have to learn
to relinquish control.

Yeah, I can do that.

Mm-hmm.
Really.

For this one, just try not
looking through the viewfinder.

Wait, what?

Come on, just try it.


[Goat bleats]

Okay. I can't see it, so...

It's not about that.

It's like my all-time
favorite photographer,

Aaron Siskind, says,

"photography is
a way of feeling,

of touching, of loving.

What you caught on film
is captured forever,

and it remembers
the little things

long after
you've forgotten them."

I like that.

It's not about
the picture being perfect.

It's about
what it ignites in you.

It will always be powerful
because you were right here

living in this moment.

Would you folks
like to hold dasher?

Girl: Yes!
Yes, please!

We'd love to.

<i> â™ª ["Up on the housetop"]</i>
Sean: Hi, cutie.

<i> â™ª [Continues]</i>

He wants some hay.

Oh, wow.

[Camera clicks]


[Goat bleats]

It does feel like magic.

I told you.

Oh, here's the one of dasher
you made me take

without looking through
the viewfinder.

But look at how you captured
the fur texture.

I mean, the tone,
only film could do that.

There is a sentimentality to it,
isn't there?

Not even one of your filters
could've pulled that off.

Thank you.

For making me do this.

You know, always happy
to spread the gospel of film.

[Phone chimes]

Oh, it's Dani.

"Couldn't find
a good spot to do it.

Amelia seemed distracted
all day too.

Not the right time, maybe."

If only they knew
the other one's thinking

the exact same thing.

Smells good.

You want me
to make you some eggs?

You're gonna make me
say it again, aren't you?

I don't eat breakfast.

Which I still take
personal offense to.

But every Christmas Eve,
my sister and I

make the biggest breakfast
spread known to man.

I'm talking eggs, bacon,
pancakes, waffles.

Well, today's the 22nd.

What happened
to your usual donut?

We got the day off, remember?
Yeah.

Our last assignment is
"Christmas lights,"

so everyone is meeting
in the town square,

so we can
see everything lit up.

Okay. That'll give me time

to develop some more
of my photos.

Well, lucky for me,
everything I shot yesterday

is already uploaded
and ready to go.

Oh, is your mind opening up
to the perks of digital?

Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

But, yes, I can't tell you
how nice it was to see

everything that I shot right
there in the blink of an eye.

Mm-mmm. Not bad.

Can I make you a plate?

No.

No, no, no, I'm good.

This is the one
you should send to Leila.

Good idea.

So with all of your traveling,

do you always bring your
developing equipment with you?

Yep. I've turned some
pretty interesting places

into makeshift darkrooms.

The cave in Peru
would probably be the craziest.

And you don't have
a home base.

My sister's got
a guesthouse that I use.

Isn't that hard,

like not having a place
to call your own?

It's just easier that way.

What do you mean?

Look, when you...

When you plant roots somewhere,
you connect to people,

and sometimes
those connections don't last.

That can be hard.

Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right.

My father left us
when I was four.

Just up and left one day.
He was done with it all.

You know, I think that's why
part of me feels like

if I just keep moving,
you know,

I can't ever be left again.

I'm sorry
that happened to you.

That's okay.

The only good thing is
my mom made sure

that every single Christmas
was the best time of the year,

extra special after he left.

I think that's why it brings me
so much joy, so much comfort.

It's also why it's so important
to my sister and I

that we...

That we continue
our traditions.

Now you get to share
your love of Christmas

with grinches like me.

You said it, not me.

Whoo!

Thank you all for coming out.

I know it's very chilly tonight,

and a storm
is supposed to roll in,

but I promise
tonight will be worth it.

Always like to do a shoot
where we're all together,

focused on
the same subject matter.

Tonight it is photographing

the amazing Christmas lights
in pine falls.

Before you all fan out,
I want to encourage you

to experiment with
your exposure triangle

to bring energy to your photos.

Look for ways to tell a story
using your environment.

Go! Play! Capture!

So no luck with
the proposal yesterday?

How did you know?

Well, neither one of you
are wearing rings.

Yeah, I just couldn't find
the right moment.

Every time, I was like,
"maybe this is the spot,"

she just wanted to move on
to the next place.

I'm sure the right moment
will present itself soon.

And... how was your day,

just the two of you
all alone in the cabin?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why did
your inflection just go up

at the end of that sentence?

Oh, come on. Your whole...

"We don't like each other but
secretly we do" vibe? Please.

Actually...

We had a really good day.

And Gaby is a lot of fun
to just hang out with.

Uh-huh.

Look, she lives in New York,

I live wherever
the magazine takes me,

and that's that.

So you thought about it then.

Perhaps.
You know, here and there.

Only as much as anyone would

who enjoys spending time with
someone who's intelligent.

Sure.

Attractive.
Yeah.

Charming.
Right.

But that's it. It's just
a fleeting thought, okay?

She's had this one-track mind
ever since she got here.

Well, tomorrow's
the last day, so...

So that's it.

Nothing's gonna happen.

If you say so.


I know she'll say yes though.

Got you this.

I already know you're gonna say
it's too sugary.

I'll take it.

It's hot.

That's kind of why
it's part of the name.

Does this mean you're gonna try
mine with the cocoa from Ghana?

Yeah, I'll try some
when we get home.

You know, I think we should
go that way

because we'll get
a great wide shot.

Uh, it's probably...

You should come.

Come.

Uh, yeah, that's a great idea.

And I will join you.
Oh, great.

She would like this.
Yeah.

Back there,
you called the cabin "home."

I did?

Yeah, and I liked it.

Technically, it is our home
until at least tomorrow.

What are you getting at?

I know it was a mistake
that we even crossed paths

in the first place.

I just, I wanted to say that...

Oh, my gosh.

I know.
There's something here and...

Yeah, look at that!

Uh, okay, uh...

Gaby: Wow.

Sean: This...

This is definitely making
my Christmas wonder folder.

No picture can
do this place justice.

Oh, I agree.

When I was little,

I used to go through
my grandma's scrapbooks,

and I would have
this overwhelming feeling

of wanting to crawl inside them
and live there forever.

This place gives me
that feeling.

Yeah, I mean, there's Christmas
and then there's this.

You know, this warmth
and magic...

Inexplicable beauty.

This is it
what is?

Where Dani should
propose to Amelia.

Or Amelia to Dani.

Yeah, it's perfect.

So?

You're right.
This is really good.

You see, it's how they
harvest the cocoa bean.

I wonder how long
it's gonna snow like this.

You know, I have a flight out
tomorrow night.

Yeah, same.

I really hope I can be
with my sister and her family

for Christmas Eve.

How long are you staying for?
A few days.

And then it's on
to your next adventure.

You know how it is.
There's always some place to be

and something
to take a picture of.

Yeah, but there is nothing like
going home to your own apartment

after a long day.

Don't you ever wish
you had a bed

or just some of your own walls

where you could hang up
your favorite pictures?

Sometimes.

Oh, look.
It's so beautiful.

So all the roads are closed.

And they're expecting
more snow tonight.

I've decided to move
the showcase to the 25th

<i> and make it</i>
<i> a Christmas celebration.</i>

I was supposed to be on
a flight out tonight.

I don't think
that's gonna happen.

If the roads don't reopen,
I'll be here too.

<i> I'll keep everyone updated.</i>

In the meantime,
stay safe and warm.

Thanks. You too.

So what do we do now?

Looks like we have ourselves
a snow day.

<i>â™ª Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª there's a magic in the air</i>
<i> this Christmas â™ª</i>

All right, Mr. Snowman,

I want you to give me
stone cold.

Is that what you think I do?

<i> â™ª You can see it</i>
<i> on the smiling faces â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª feels like all your dreams â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª could come your way â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

My weather app says there's
more snow in a few hours.

I already called my sister
and told her,

let her know I probably won't
make it until after Christmas.

I'm sorry.

All things considered,

this isn't the worst place
to get stuck.

And the company
isn't half-bad either.

Indeed.

Sean...
Gaby...


Sorry, go ahead.

Um...

I just wanted to say...

I'm glad we're stuck together.

What'd you wanna say?

Exact same thing.

[Phone ringing]

I'm so sorry.

[Ringing continues]

Um, let me...
Yeah.


It's Leila.
Yeah.

Hi, Leila.

I have some exciting news.

An early Christmas gift,
if you will.

Really?
<i> - I have been so impressed</i>

<i> with your progress lately</i>

<i> that today I spoke to Iris</i>
<i> all about you,</i>

<i> and she wants to talk to you</i>
<i> about the staff position</i>

<i> in person.</i>

Oh, my gosh!

Thank you, thank you!

<i> That's not even the best part.</i>
<i> Get this.</i>

She asked me to bring you to her
Christmas party as my plus-one.

You are kidding.

I would not joke about
something like this.

<i> Um, well, that's the day</i>
<i> after tomorrow, right?</i>

<i> I'm stuck in pine falls.</i>

What do you mean?
I thought you fly back tonight.

Yeah, there was a snowstorm,
the roads are closed,

and they're also saying
it's gonna snow tonight.

Oh, no.

<i> Well, um, what time is</i>
<i> Iris' Christmas party?</i>

7 P.M.

And do you think it would hurt
my chances if I didn't come?

<i> Yes! Yes, unfortunately, I do.</i>

<i> But I talked you up</i>
<i> so much today,</i>

<i> and Iris is eager to see</i>
<i> if you vibe</i>

<i> with the inner circle</i>
<i> that's gonna be there.</i>

<i> Those were her words.</i>

Um, okay,
well, you know, um...

Maybe it won't snow tomorrow,

and I'll be able
to get on a redeye?

Do whatever you can.
This is big.

I will.

<i> All right. Keep me posted.</i>

Did you hear that?

Uh, yeah.

Iris Holmes wants to meet me.

You know, I hate to say it,

but the chances of you
getting out of here by then,

they don't look so good.

Well, I mean, maybe it won't
snow as much tonight, right?

Or maybe they'll
plow the roads early.

Yeah, maybe.

Hey, look, either way,

tomorrow morning
is Christmas Eve,

and since we'll be stuck
together until further notice,

we're gonna celebrate.

Just us?
Yeah.

It'll keep you from
obsessing over road conditions.

You're right.
It's out of our hands anyway.

We might as well
make the best of it.

Now, see, that's the spirit.

Listen, um, tonight,
if you want the bed, it's yours.

Don't be silly.

I'm starting to get
used to the couch.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Besides someone has
to wake up early

to make you the best breakfast
spread you've ever seen.

I don't eat...
Oh, you will on Christmas Eve.

I promise.

Nonstop snow last night.
The roads are still closed.

Looks like I'm gonna have
to start accepting the fact

that I'm gonna miss this party.


Merry Christmas Eve.

Wow. You weren't joking.

And everything is red and green.

Yeah, just like mom
used to make it.

Bacon or sausage,
pancakes or waffles.

Red or green eggs.

Or you could just have it all.

It does smell really good.

Oh, by the way,
have you seen the dishtowel?

Oh, yeah, I set...

Oh!

Yeah, I thought I'd try it
just for you.

Now since neither one of us
is going anywhere anytime soon,

I thought that we'd
just enjoy today.

Sounds like a plan.

<i> â™ª Ooh â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª tick tock tick</i>
<i> it's coming on quick â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª yeah, Santa Claus</i>
<i> is on his way â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª loading lots of toys</i>
<i> for the girls and boys â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª on his trusty</i>
<i> Christmas sleigh â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª ooh, ooh, whee â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Christmas is coming fast â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª ooh, ooh, whee â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Christmas is coming fast â™ª</i>

Okay, so the key
to making reindeer food

is to spread it all out evenly.

Mm-hmm, yes.

So reindeer food is really
rice krispie treats.

What? No, not at all.

Come on, it's reindeer food.

That just look like
rice krispie treats.

Okay, what kind of
rice krispie treats do you know

that have chocolate bars
on them?

Oh, yeah, that's right!

Oh, yeah, that makes it
totally different.

See? Well, I think we're
ready for the chocolate.

Right, because we haven't had
enough sugar today.

Ah, come on, it's Christmas Eve.
That doesn't count.

Everyone knows that.

[Phone chimes]
Oh.

The road's open?
No, it's Dani.

"Can't wait anymore.

Gonna go ahead
and propose tonight."

They should just do it together
at the bridge.

Oh, I wish we could
make that happen.

Aww.

You know...

The roads might not be open,

but I'm pretty sure we could
get to the bridge on foot.

Tell Dani you got
the perfect place

and to tell Amelia that
they're going to meet up with us

to take more pictures
around town.

We should get flower petals.
You know, just...

Candles.

Oh! Definitely candles.

Yeah.

Dani: This is gorgeous.

Amelia: It's like something
out of a fairy tale

Dani...

You are...

The closest thing to perfection
that I've ever found.

I've just been waiting
my entire life

to find someone like you.


What?

I got you one too.

Oh, my god.

Sean: Mm-hmm.

Boom.

I'm really sorry you won't
be able to make Iris' party.

I've made peace with it.

You know, I'll just have to
talk to Iris some other time.

But...

I had the best day ever today.

I love you!

At least you'll make
the showcase tomorrow.

I am so looking forward
to critiquing your work.


I have something special
for you.

Really?

You kinda sort of mentioned

that you have
a Christmas Eve tradition

of opening up one gift, so...

Here you go.
What?

Oh, you didn't have to.

Trust me, it's not a big deal.
Just...

Wait, what is...

Yeah, right behind the tree.
Is that...


You didn't.
I did.

What? Oh, my gosh!

Yeah.

Come on, you first.

Okay.
Yeah.


My own Christmas robe.

Mm-hmm.

Not blah at all.

Nope.

Thank you.

Okay, my turn.
Yeah.

It's perfect.

But when did you have time
to frame it and wrap it?

When you were making
our dinner.

One day,
when you're settled down

and you find your home base,

you can hang this up
on the wall

and remember the Christmas
photography retreat.

I won't need a picture
to remind me, but...

This will be great.

Thank you.

Thank you.

You showed me a Christmas
I forgot long ago.

And the best part
about this Christmas...

Was being with you, Gaby.

[Horn honking]

[Car door opens, closes]


Fran: Merry Christmas Eve!

Merry Christmas Eve.

We just wanted to come check on
you both after all that snow.

Yeah.
You drove?

You drove!

Yeah. Roads opened back up.
You're our first stop.

They did.

Oh, my gosh.
That is fantastic.

It's a Christmas miracle!

Fran: Or just
hard-working plows.

Yeah. Maybe a little of both.

You know what? I might be able
to make that redeye.

Excuse me, what is that?

Gaby's trying to make it
back to New York

in time to make this big
Christmas party tomorrow night.

What about the showcase?

Oh, well, this is basically
an interview for my dream job.

Oh, well, then good luck.

Do you want to come in?

No, no. We're just on our way
to midnight mass.

We just wanted to stop by
and check on you both.

Glad you're all right
and good luck tomorrow.

Yeah.

Gaby: Thank you.

[Car door opens, closes]

[Engine starts]

[Car departs]

There are no flights left
tonight,

but there are definitely a few
tomorrow morning.

I better pack.

Yeah, you should...
You should do that.

Um, good night. Thank you
for dinner and everything.

What time is it?

Uh, it's early.
But I have good news.

I was able to book a flight
for 10 A.M.

That is good news.
Yeah.

I'm gonna be cutting it close,

but I think I might be able
to make the party.

Well, what do you know?

Reindeer food's gone.

Huh.

I guess Santa and his crew
came by at some point.

You know, it's a shame
you'll miss the showcase.

Yeah, well, I mean, it's either
interviewing for my dream job

at the most prestigious party
of the year,

or go into a retreat
photo viewing

at the pine falls gallery.

Yeah.

Uh, about last night,

you know, I feel like
one of us should address it.

It's kind of the reindeer
in the room, if you will.

Yeah, that was some kiss.

Yeah.

I think you're wonderful.

At first,
I thought you were annoying,

a little crazy, a bit odd.

Well, thanks.

But I wanted you to know I...

I ended up having
the best time with you.

And...
Look...

You know how hard I've worked
for this opportunity.

And I know she'll see how
amazing you are. It's just...

I hate to see you go.

We both knew we would go our
separate ways eventually, right?

I live in New York, and...

You live nowhere
and everywhere.

Oh, I gotta go.

By the time I drop off the
rental car and everything else,

go.
I'm cutting it so close.

Get that job.

And you show Iris Holmes

that not only are you
a great photographer

but a newfound
Christmas enthusiast.

Tell everybody
I said goodbye, okay?

Yeah, of course.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Okay.

<i> Leila: What's your eta?</i>

I'm headed to the airport now.
I should make it.

Ah!

Good. I can breathe again.

I was gonna feel responsible
if you didn't make it

because I was the one that sent
you there in the first place.

Didn't factor in a storm.

It's all good.

You know, everything's happening
the way it's supposed to.

Oh, you know what?
That reminds me.

Can I use this photo
for our<i> style source</i> Instagram?

It's the one of the guy
smiling by the lake.

<i> Totally. Go for it.</i>

Great. He's a cutie,
whoever he is.

Yeah. He's really funny,
you know,

and kind.

And he's a really good cook.

Sounds like a unicorn.

<i> All right,</i>
<i> I'll see you tonight.</i>

I have no doubt
that once Iris meets you,

she will agree
you're perfect for the job.

[Door closes, bell rings]


Merry Christmas.

It's so good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

Ah, lovely work.

Yeah, so nice.

[Door opens, bell rings]

Laurie, I wanna chat with you.

[Door closes, bell rings]

Let me know if you guys need
anything else, all right?

Yup.
Okay.

Amelia: Hey.

Hey, I got a text from Gaby.

It's great about the job.
So exciting.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, are you all right?

I'll be fine.

You never know
what the future holds.

Maybe.

Hello. Merry Christmas.

Oh, here come Fran and Robert.

We haven't told them yet.

Sean, you better come
to our wedding.

We're thinking next Christmas,
maybe Alaska.

Oh, I am so there.

Just a second.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

You did some great work
this week.

Thanks. You don't have to say

most of my favorites
are when I went digital.

I may have to consider
doing it more often.

All thanks to Gaby,
of course.

Did you look
at your display yet?

Nah, I looked at those prints
all week.

There were some
you hadn't marked to hang,

but I thought they should be
displayed anyway.

I've been doing this
a long time.

I haven't found very many people
able to do this.

Do what?

Capture love.

I just...
I met her a week ago.

The camera doesn't lie.

Yeah, well, unlike a photograph,
people come and go.

No one ever stays in frame
for too long.

[Door opens, bell rings]

You sure about that?

You came.

You wanna go for a walk
with me?

I know this really cool place
nearby.

You know, I...
I can't believe you came.

I mean, what about New York,
the Christmas party?

I got to the airport, and...

Then it hit me.

I don't want to give up being
a freelance photographer.

And if I get the staff job,
that'll be my whole life.

I love fashion,

but I want to explore
all elements of photography,

all subjects, all themes.

So...

I told Leila
I wanted to be free,

to have it all.

[Sean chuckles]

You could even dip your toe
into wildlife photography.

Exactly.

Leila didn't feel warmth
and emotions in my pictures

because...

I didn't feel them
when I was taking them.

Being a good photographer
means living life...

And sharing life.

And I didn't know that
until I got here.

After you went to bed
last night,

I started to look for apartments
in New York City.

You did?

And you were right.

You know, I need a...

I need a home base.

A place to hang my pictures.

A place to make new Christmas
traditions with someone?

My thoughts exactly.
