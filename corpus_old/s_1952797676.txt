--the forecast,
plenty of sunshine for the state--

A 9-year-old metro girl has
a new lease on life--

The Dr. Marjorie Show.

The lines are open.
504-555-0199. Call in now.

All right, next call.

Doctor, I just want you to know
how much your support has meant.

Oh, it just takes time.

I know, and I really appreciate it.

You have been a great, great inspiration
to our Iisteners, Ray...

...and although you have come
a very Iong way...

...the journey to healing isn't over yet.
Tell her you Iove her.

Yeah, well, I'm a changed man, doc.

And now that I'm getting out,
there's somebody very special...

...I'm gonna get back in my life.
Oh, and I'm sure you will.

I'm sure you will,
but it does take time and....

Go get them, Ray-Ray.

Hey, Ray, take care now, all right?

You too, bro.

These are for you.

What am I gonna do with these?
Give them to your kids.

Don't be afraid to read one,
maybe you'll Iearn something.

Dinosaurs?
Helped pass the time.

One in here special for you.

"39 Paths to Self Discovery
by Dr. Marjorie."

I've walked down every one of those paths
in the Iast seven years, Jimmy.

Let me tell you something, Oprah,
all roads Iead right back here.

Failure is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Just platitudes, brother.

Easier said than done.

We'll see.

Good Iuck, Ray-Ray.
Thanks, man.

You know what?
It's a whole new world for me.

From now on, it's just Ray.

Just plain Ray.

Let me ask you something, what's a guy
fresh out of prison usually do first?

Usually something stupid.

Not this time, my friend.

We'll keep a Iight on for you.

Ray-Ray.

Come Iook at me, Ray.

Look at me, Ray-Ray.

You can't ignore me forever.
I'm here to help.

I don't see anybody else around to help
you on the day you get out of prison.

Friends forever.

Through thick and thin. Come on, Ray,
I'll give you a ride to wherever you want.

Come on, Ray-Ray.
I owe you that much at Ieast.

It's Ray. Plain Ray.

What happened to the other Ray?

I wanna drive.
What?

I wanna drive.

I've been inside for seven years.
It's what I do. I wanna drive.

You wanna drive?

If that'll make you happy.

What are you doing?
You're right, Larue.

You do owe me one.

Give me back my car!

This is no way to continue a friendship!

Damn. I can't believe I fell for that.

See you tomorrow.

I'm the inventor of my future.

I'm the inventor of my future.
I'm the inventor of my future.

Hey, Slim.

Ray-Ray.

It's just Ray. Plain Ray.

Nice car.

Thanks. A friend Ioaned it to me.

You shouldn't have come here, Ray.
I told you I would. I had to.

Okay, then you do me a favor, Ray.

You turn around
and you Ieave right now.

Damn it. I didn't want this to happen.

Oh, my God.

Sally?

Are you who I think you are?

Oh, you take my breath away.

Seems funny now, you're being
so grown up and all, but here.

I'm sorry,
but I don't know what you expected.

Every journey begins with a step.

Hey, over here.

Sally, sorry to surprise you.
I told your mom I was coming.

I guess she didn't believe me
or something but-- Stop.

Come on.

How about it? Fresh start?
Remember the handshake?

You really think a stupid teddy bear...

...and some Iame handshake
are going to make things okay?

I'm a different man now, a better man.

Yeah. Then maybe you should try
your fresh start in Alaska.

Then I'll do what I've always done,
pretend you don't exist.

Which one of you
is blowing off fireworks?

He snuck up behind me
and he almost busted my eardrums.

"AII warfare is based on deception,"
buttwipe.

Yeah, and "he will win who knows
when to fight and when not to."

You read The Art of War by Sun Tzu?
Yeah, who hasn't?

Listen. You guys need to find a better way
to channel your aggression.

I found macramÃ©
to be strangely comforting.

Show's over. Everyone, get to class.

You two, come with me.

Thank you, sir.
Sure.

Miss Miller?

Yes. Thank you, Mr...?

Ray Bradstone, Sally's dad.

Oh, how do you do?

I'm Miss Miller.

Sally, it's so nice
to finally meet your father.

Yeah, me too.

I've only met your Iovely wife.

I guess you've been busy working?

Funny, I just spent the Iast seven years
in federal--

Government.

Yeah, he does a Iot of work
for the federal government.

Oh, I see. Mr. Bradstone...

...do you know about our school trip?
School trip?

Sally, I can't believe you haven't
told your dad. How come?

You know, he's been working a Iot Iately.
And it just--

Well, we have a bit of a problem that
I think you might be able to help with.

The school trip is scheduled
for next weekend...

...and we're short a chaperone.
No, no, no.

The New Orleans Museum of Art.
The dinosaur exhibit is there.

Dinosaurs? I Iove dinosaurs.

Well, fantastic. It's settled then.

Yeah, I guess it is.

Excuse me.
Of course.

Hey. If this is gonna work between us...

...we gotta confront it,
tell the truth and Iet it go.

No, this isn't going to work between us.

What did you expect me to say to her,
"Meet my dad, the criminal"?

I appreciate you not selling me out, but--
I didn't do that for you. I did it for me.

I don't even know you.
That's why I'm here. To change that.

Oh, really?

Yeah, what was the Iast thing you said,
the "Iet it go" part?

You might wanna try that, Iike, now.

Because if you go on that field trip,
I'm not.

Your husband hurt you very much,
and no one's denying that.

But you have to let it go and move on.

Remember the three essentials?

Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go.
Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go.

Now, sounds like it's time,
don't you think?

I've already forgotten the car incident
and I'm willing to try again.

What do you want?
I want a minute.

I don't have a minute.
This can't be where you're staying.

This can't be the digs of the best driver
and getaway man in the business.

I know how it is when you get out.
You need help? I'm here to help.

Take this. It's my pleasure.

You need to walk away.

I respect that you're upset.
You got a right to be, my friend.

I was just trying to help.

You knew the silent alarm was tripped,
you walked out the back door.

Ray, the cops was on you already.

You Ieft me sitting in that car.
I still didn't rat you out.

That's exactly why I'm here, bro.
To try to make things right between us.

Honest to God, I am haunted by it.

I mean it when I say I owe you one.

I know that. I know I owe you.

I'm putting the crew back together.
It's a bank.

So ripe, it's a crime how easy it is.

Make you whole again,
get you out of this toilet.

And all you gotta do
is what you do best.

Drive.

Seven years. Seven years.

I Iost my wife, I Iost my kid!

You'll change your mind, Ray-Ray.
You're one of us.

Since we were Iittle kids.

Let it go.

I'm gonna make things right.

Got it?

Dr. Etman, we have your new TV.
Outstanding.

Family room, in the back to the right.
Thank you.

AII right.
Thank you.

Honey, I'll see you Iater--

I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

I'm....
Putting in the HD? Come on in.

No. I'm Lynne's ex.

Wow, okay.

Marvin Etman. Doctor.

Marvin.

Lynne and I are....

Marvin, could we have a minute, please?
Okay, then.

Did you think you could just pretend
everything was the same?

Come on, Lynne, I've changed.
I really have, okay?

I need your help with her, that's all.
I forgot I was Ieaving.

I'm holding a staff meeting at 9.

Did I mention I was a doctor?
Yup.

AII right.

Okay.

You want me to stay?
No, no, no, I'm fine, Marvin.

Thank you.
Okay. AII right.

Marvin?

Marvin is a wonderful man
and Sally adores him.

And I'm Sally's father, okay?

I'm sorry, Ray, but we have built
a really good Iife without you here.

I'm a nurse now.

I struggled through school
as a single mom without you.

We did it
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

That is not fair.

I at Ieast deserve a second chance
to know my own daughter.

Your daughter is not the same Iittle girl
you remember.

What happened hurt her more deeply
than you could understand.

I understand how you feel. I really do.

Just tell me what I gotta do, you know?

I'll earn a second chance,
but tell me what I have to do.

What do you want me to say, Ray?
There's no magic bullet here.

Try acting Iike a parent.

Prove that you're responsible, reliable.

Do you even have a job?

I gotta go.

I can fix anything on four wheels.

Ever done a Hummer?
You're talking about the car, right?

I mean, pretty much,
a car's a car, right?

They're all the same.

How about a Smart car?

Is that a real car?

What about a hybrid?

Like a Smart Hummer?

Live fungus is kept in the cooler.

And these are bran, Iow-fat,
no-fat chocolate chip cookies...

...our garden vegetable burgers,
and our tossed organic green salads...

...with a sprout and carrot medley.

And that, of course, is our wheatgrass.

Any questions?

No meat?
No meat.

But you got fungus.

Yes, indeed. We move tons of fungus.

Nice juicy steak, no?
No.

Cholesterol? Through the roof.
Not good.

I gotta tell you,
meat's been pretty good to me.

Maybe you ought to give it a shot.

Okay, that's good.

High school, good.

And for the past seven years,
you have been...?

Incarcerated.

Is that gonna be a problem?

It's hard being on the outside,
you know?

Things are different,
stuff just moves so much faster.

How are things
with your daughter, Ray?

Not good.

She really doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

Maybe she just needs some more time.

No.

You know, they seem happy.

Big house. Lots of stuff.
My ex-wife's boyfriend is this rich doctor.

I can't compete with that.

But you are her father, Ray.

Don't ever forget that.

Yeah. I haven't.

She has.

Fire funny to you?

Not ha-ha kind, but, Iike, ironic.

Everything I had Ieft in the world...

...is in that apartment.

Man, that's.... That's rough.

It wasn't much.

Tell me about the bank.

Good to have you back, Ray-Ray.

So glad to have you aboard,
Mr. Abromowitz.

Please. Stanley.

Well, it's just you and me, Stanley.

We have our hands full.
As Iong as you're here, could be worse.

I'm sorry?
I mean-- You know what you mean.

Thanks, Dad.

Eight-fifty-six and six seconds.

Very efficient, Simon.

You know you're only allowed two bags.

I'm aware of the regulations
but these are all essential.

Meds and specialty diet food.

Laptop. iPad and clothes.

Hypoallergenic pillow.

Okay. That's enough. My head hurts,
and we're Iate as it is.

So take your things over there.
I'll make an exception.

Nick?

Can you tell me why
you haven't Ioaded a single bag?

Picture hasn't formed yet.

Great.

It is good to have you back, Ray-Ray.

You know the one thing I really enjoyed
about prison, Goldy?

What's that?

The absence of you.

Keep tapping your hands Iike that
I'm gonna cut them off.

I'm gonna cut off your hands.

Why--? What--? What do you--? What?

Okay. Even if somebody trips the alarm,
cops' response is five to seven minutes.

We're out of there in under three,
no matter what.

In case something happens
in those three minutes...

...just press the call button,
Iet us know.

Goldy, the masks.

Condi Rice? Interesting choice.

They discontinued Rumsfeld.

Let's do this.

You sure you're gonna be okay?
Yes, Mom. It's only one night.

It's the first time we've been away
from each other Iike this.

I'll be fine.

You'll be fine.

Marvin will be fine. You're gonna have
a great time without me.

You have my number if anything happens.
I do as Iong as you haven't changed it.

I Iove you.

I Iove you too.
Okay.

Have fun.
I will.

Be safe.
Thanks, Mom.

Trick or treat. Everybody down.
Everybody down.

You heard the man. Get on the ground.

Not you. Come on. Give it.
Come on, genius. AII the money.

Hey.
Hey.

Heck, yeah, you're doing great.

Don't touch, Daddy. I can do it.

I know, I'm not doing anything.
You're doing it all by yourself.

I know, Daddy.
I can drive just Iike you now.

Okay. Pull over to the curb.

That was awesome.

Handshake?

Thanks, Daddy.

Not again.

This is Meredith Sherbourne confirming
my 4:00 with Dr. Frankenheimer.

I have the address, yes. Thanks.

Isn't there, Iike, a recovery period?

Not with Dr. Frankenheimer.

He did Jessica Simpson, and her Iips
were paparazzi-ready in 24 hours.

Mr. Choi? This is Ted.

The guy who ordered the six boxes
of cherry bombs and M-80s.

Okay. Yeah.
I'll be at your store before you close.

Josh, there's a seat back here.

Hey, Brenda. Okay if I sit here?

Sure. Might as well.
Thanks.

Children, I don't want any inappropriate
use of cell phones or iPods.

And no gum.

Oh, Mr. Bradstone.

You still short a chaperone?

Yes, we are. Welcome aboard.

Come on.
Big bucks, no whammies, baby.

Get that bag. Come on.

Coming up on two and a half minutes.

What the hell are you Iooking at?
I'm sorry.

Your mask.

Condoleezza Rice, right?

What?

You think this is funny?

You do realize I'm robbing you, right, Iady?
You do see the gun, right?

You think it's funny, a gun in your face?

Like I won't shoot you dead?

Like I'm joking around?

So you didn't intend it to be funny?

Everybody, Iisten up.

I would Iike you to meet Sally's father,
Mr. Bradstone.

He will be joining us.

Please, God, take me now.

Oh, won't you sit down?
Thanks.

Cops! You said five minutes!

They're still a ways off and we've got
Ray-Ray behind the wheel. Let's go.

Thank you very much.

Hey, okay, Iet's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Okay. Go, go, go. Come on.
Go, go, go.

Where the hell is Ray-Ray?

I'm gonna kill Ray-Ray twice.

He took the keys. Why take the keys?
You serious?

Shut up, all right?

They didn't see us come out the bank.
They don't know we robbed the bank.

Just be calm. Stay calm.

Run!

Del, where the hell are you going?

Listen to me.
Please, get off this bus now.

I'm begging you.

I get off this bus, I Iose you forever.

Same goes if you stay.

Let it go.

Oh, dude,
you messed up my bags, man.

Hey.
He's got the money.

Come on. We gotta go.
That money ain't no good to us in jail.

What the hell is he doing?
Larue, we gotta go now.

Hey, you probably ought to get moving.

Cops are gonna jam us up.
No field trip.

I Iike to Iet the engine warm up first.

I find that a warm engine
is a happy engine.

It's warm. Go.

Now.

Officer involved in a 10-20.
Possibly 10-20-I.

Excuse me.
You don't wanna go to work today.

Why not?
Because we have guns.

And we need your car.

It's a police emergency.
Commandeering.

Except we're not the police.

I always wanted to do that.

We gotta get that money back.

There.

Well, Iook who's going on a field trip.

Hey, hey, hey.

Come on. The truck.
I see it.

The truck!

So let me get this straight.

He took your Visa, your MasterCard,
your American Express....

Get out.

You're not supposed to move
after a blow.

I just went to a safety seminar.
Come on. Get out of here.

Hey. You bruised my coccyx.

I don't see the bus.

Well, Redwood Junior High School
Ioves New Orleans.

We're just gonna ask a few questions.

Who would you say was in charge?
I'm not following.

It's a simple question.
Who was in charge?

Bush or Cheney?

Not sure.

I couldn't keep my eyes off
of Condoleezza Rice.

It made no sense to me.

A man chooses
a Condoleezza Rice mask to rob a bank...

...then gets offended when somebody
has a perfectly normal reaction to it?

At first I thought, "Hey,
I almost don't mind being robbed...

...by a guy in a Condoleezza Rice mask.
It shows he has a sense of humor."

I Iike a guy with a sense of humor.

Detectives?
We found these keys in the bushes.

They fit the SUV out front.
And we got a print.

Let me up. I gotta go talk to my kid.

Sally, I know I don't have a place
in your heart right now...

...or your mom's.

At Ieast not yet.

But I was kind of hoping...

...that you could give me a chance
to at Ieast show you the real me.

This might be my Iast shot at it.
What do you say?

I don't see you.

I don't hear you.

You're not even on the bus.

Stop the bus.

What?
You heard me. I said, stop the bus.

Hand it over.

Don't play dumb. Hand it over.
Look, the shot wasn't meant for you.

Collateral damage is an inherent
byproduct of any armed conflict.

AII due respect to Sun Tzu...

...where I come from...

...you find the guy that did it...

...you tear his heart out.

I'm Mr. Bradstone.

I'm the chaperone.

It is too frigging Ioud in here.

And I've got a headache
the size of the moon.

Mr. Bradstone--

Now, I've got no intentions of traveling
with a bunch of screaming misfits.

So tone it way down.

And don't test me, or it'll get ugly.

If you understand English
raise your hands.

Now shut up.

Mr. Bradstone. Could...?

Hi.

We don't ever tell our children
to shut up.

Even when they misbehave
and act Iike brats.

Why not?

Do you know the definition of "Iawsuit"?

No matter what these children do...

...they cannot be met
with such verbal aggression.

Do you hear that?
Librarians kill for that kind of quiet.

I know.

Me too.

The problem is that when misbehavior
is met with your kind of strictness...

...bad behavior stops immediately...

...but then it begins again
and again and again.

Okay. Yeah.

Your turf.

Thank you.

Seen his tattoo?
It's not the type you get in the mall.

It's the type you get in a back alley with
a pen, guitar strings and a 9-volt battery.

Plus he read The Art of War.

Yeah, I know. I thought I was bad.
I've only read the CliffNotes.

He's either a narc or a CIA agent.
Or both.

He's hot. Old hot, but still.

Scary hot.

This guy's probably Special Forces
or Navy SEALs.

My marriage was a disaster.

I've been divorced seven years.

A day doesn't go by when I don't think of it
and get a pain right here.

Confront it. Tell the truth. Let it go.

You knocked off the first one,
work on the other two.

I feel something very deeply
for Miss Miller.

Happy for you.

But I need your advice.

You're a man of the world.

What do I say?

I'm so out of practice.

AII right, Iisten.

You're obviously a big talker, right?

The key for you is,
Iet her do some talking, all right?

And then when she's done talking,
inhale deeply...

...hold it.

Then respond.

Lets her think you're a big Iistener.

Breath mint wouldn't hurt either.

Came on a Iittle strong, huh?

I mean, we're here now, right?

So you gotta make the most
of the moment.

Are you high?

When are you gonna understand...

...that every second you're here
drives us farther apart?

Excuse me, sir.

My name is Josh. Listen, I really
appreciate what you did back there.

I swear I read this page 11 times.

Yeah.

Yeah, you know, it was pretty Ioud.

Yeah. Nice meeting you.

Well, I'm glad somebody appreciated it.

Just because that print is Ray Bradstone's
does not put him back behind bars.

It sure as hell puts him
at the crime scene.

Ray drives.

He saw things going bad on the inside
and took a walk.

Seven years ago, I busted this guy.
You know what the joker says to me?

"Thank you.
I'm gonna turn my Iife around."

And you know what? I believed him.

Del.

Hey, Del.

Del, can you hear me?

There's no school today, Mommy.

AII right, Del, we know you hit
that bank on Main...

...and your associates, Phillip Larue
and Goldy Stentz, stole a car...

...right around the corner from the bank.

Why don't you make it easy on yourself
and tell us where they are.

You saw a shooting star?

Focus, Del. Where's the money?

Pretty bus.

What bus?

Pretty signs.

Going on a trip for school.

School trip?
Field trip of some kind? What?

Oh, jeez.

Yeah?

Papers?

Redwood Junior High School.
Please connect me.

Redwood Junior High.

Yeah. You have that
field trip today, right?

Yeah, that's right. Who is this?

My niece forgot her--

She Ieft her backpack in my car.

She needs it right away.

I'm sorry. They're on their way.

We sent home agendas
for all the students.

Perhaps I could contact the teacher
in charge of the--

Well, I'm in a bit of a panic here
because my niece needs her insulin...

...and she forgot her schedule,
and you know how kids are.

It's not our policy to give out schedules
over the phone, sir.

Really? Well, I'm a Iawyer
with Stein, Simon and Moxie.

And if my Iittle niece
doesn't get her insulin...

...she could go into a coma...

...and, you know what, boom,
she'd go in a coma and she could die.

I'll still need the child's name, sir.
It's school policy.

Bradstone.
Bradstone.

Oh, Sally, yes.

Well, they're scheduled to arrive at the
New Orleans Museum of Art at 11 :00...

...then on to a tour
of the French Quarter...

...and then on to the
Satchmo Music Festival this evening.

Hello?

Hello?

You know, Larue, I've been thinking.

So Del ran around one side of the bus
with our money...

...and come out the other side without it,
then it turns out Ray-Ray's on the bus?

I mean, you don't think....

You do think.

Ray-Ray.

Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

There are a few rules
that we need adhere to.

People.

Excuse me.
I need your attention, please.

People, I am talking.

Oh, for the Iove of-- Children.

Hey!

Listen up!

As of this moment,
consider yourself under my watch.

I expect all rules to be followed.

If not, meal rations will be taken away,
visitor privileges denied...

...and hard Iabor instituted.

I mean, you'll get a detention.

Right.

So file in, quietly.

You're Iearning.

Is this a field trip or basic training?

It's Iike a bad episode of Nanny 911.

And I thought my parents were Iosers.

Del Muniz sees a bus here by the school,
maybe it's a field trip or something.

Ten minutes Iater, the truck guy sees
Goldy and Larue driving alongside a bus.

You think it's the same bus?
Maybe.

What if our man Ray-Ray
is on that bus?

I bet you that if we find that bus...

...we're gonna find Ray
and a whole Iot of money.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I'm so sorry, but there's been
a bit of a mix-up.

Unfortunately, the docent assigned
to your class has called in sick...

...and we don't have anyone else
to cover the tour.

No tour.

Yeah.
Wait just a minute.

You don't have anyone to fill in?

I'm sorry, but not at the moment.

No problem.

I know the perfect person.

This is Oviraptor philoceratops.

Anybody know what that means?
No.

Sally?

No clue.

It means "egg snatcher."

What was your name?
Simon.

Not only is Simon
immaculately overdressed...

...he also happens to be correct.

Oh, so they stole eggs.

Kind of Iike dinosaur robbers.

Maybe they should've returned the eggs
and gone to dinosaur jail.

Maybe. Except that they weren't
egg robbers, they were egg protectors.

Oviraptors Iived
their whole Iives devoted...

...to defending their nests
and feeding their young.

Well, they sucked at that, didn't they?
Since they are now extinct?

First of all, you shouldn't say "suck."

Second of all,
they did the best they could.

Well, their best wasn't good enough.

Was it?

Okay then.

Moving on.

Does anybody know what modern animal
is a direct descendant of the Oviraptor?

Anyone other than Simon?

How about you?
I see you trying to hide back there.

Come on, give it a shot.

I don't know. Lizards?

That's a really good guess.

I'm gonna give you a hint.

They're around us everywhere,
crapping on everything.

Dogs?

So you think
that a Tyrannosaurus rex...

...is now being carried around
in a Iittle bag by Paris Hilton?

What about cats?
Way off.

AIIigators.

Snakes?

Bears?

Elephants?
Incorrect-o.

Chickens.

Wait. We have a winner.

As funny as that sounds, she's right.

It's birds.

It's been proven now that birds' ancestors
all had fused clavicles...

...and well developed furcula.

You're saying birds descended
from dinosaurs.

Right.

That's pretty cool.

AII right, who wants to see
an Allosaurus?

This way.

You are doing wonderfully, Mr. B.

Sorry.

Hey.
Hey.

Your dad's pretty awesome.

He's one surprise after another.

You should see my beat on the woolly
mammoth. Really butter your muffin.

Kids, all right.

We've seen enough dead animals.

How many dinosaurs
you're gonna Iook at?

Let's just go back to the bus
and just move on. Okay.

No, no. It's not part of the plan.

Everything's gonna be fine. Stanley here
is gonna take you all back to the bus.

Just go with Stanley. I gotta take a Ieak.
We have another hour and a half.

I know, but Stanley's gonna move you
along. Just follow Stanley.

Go with Stanley, get to the bus.

I'll meet you out there.
It's gonna work out.

Really?
It'll be fine. It'll be great.

Okay, we'll go back.

Don't panic. Everything's fine.

This way. It's okay. Come on.

Okay, quietly, please.

Orderly. Go on.

You hear that?
He Iikes to sing...

...while he goes number two.

He'll have to pick up the tempo a bit.
We got a fire.

Trust me. Unless the fire
is under his rear end, he's not moving.

Hey, buddy, you done in there?
Nope.

What do you think you're doing?

Little man, Daddy's coming in, okay?
Just stay here until I put out the fire.

Daddy, are the firemen in here?

What are you doing here?
You fed us to the dogs, Ray.

I changed my mind, end of story.

I'm gonna make things right with my kid
and you're not gonna screw it up.

I owe you nothing.

I think you broke my nose.

That's a nice touch, using the kid
as a cover, but I don't buy it.

You Ieft us to take the hit, to get even,
and now you got the money too?

How would I have your money?

We saw Del doing his Iittle magic trick,
getting the money on that bus.

I walked away to save my family.

Yeah?

I tell you to get up?

We'll find you, Ray.
You can run, but you can't hide.

I see either one of you near my daughter,
I'm gonna finish this.

Let's go. Everybody on the bus.
No. What's going on?

What happened?
Nothing. Just gotta keep schedule.

Let's go. Get on the bus.

Listen, we can't go yet
because Nick isn't here.

This is a fire Iane. The fire department's
gonna be here any second.

You got his cell phone? Call him.

We aren't supposed to Ieave
for another hour.

I know, but who'd have known? Fire.
We gotta go. Come on.

Get on the bus.
Sometimes you gotta zig, not zag.

Go. Call Nick, you tell him to meet us
at the hotel. Everything will be fine.

AII right, who's ready
for some field tripping?

We gotta get a cab.

Right. I gotta do something about this.

Why are you driving so fast?

You're scaring everybody.
Please, Sally. Trust me, okay?

I might not be the best parent in the world,
I know how to drive.

Sorry.
No problem.

Did I not park the bus right here?

We are gonna take a tour
of the historic French Quarter.

At the end of the tour, we're gonna go
by St. Louis Cemetery Number 1.

That cemetery was established
in 1789.

And in that cemetery, we're gonna visit
the tomb of Marie Laveau...

...the voodoo queen of New Orleans.

Supposedly that tomb
is the second most visited tomb...

...in the United States.

Larue?
Ray-Ray, you stole my car.

You stole my money, okay?
You humiliated us in a public bathroom.

My patience is wearing thin with you,
my friend.

Back the hell off, Larue.

You give me back my money and I'll
back off. I'm Iooking right at you, Ray.

Surprise.

I swear to God, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face in front of your Iittle girl.

Then you know what I'm gonna do--?
No. No.

You don't come anywhere near my kid.

I've got your money right here.

I'll bring it to you.

Antoine's, across the street
from where you're standing.

AII right? I'll come to you.

Now you're talking sense, Ray-Ray.

I'll be right here, I'll be here waiting.

That's them.
You got them.

Ray-Ray, you son of a bitch,
you double-crossed me again!

You're dead!

Children, you have 20 more minutes,
then back to the bus.

Kellan Smith, right?

Yeah.
He's awesome.

Like, nobody here
even knows who he is.

Well, they say that song
is about his father.

Well, yeah, stepfather really...

...but same idea.
Yeah.

It's Iike he writes for--

I don't know.
Outsiders.

Exactly, you know.

People with brains,
not these clones or wannabes.

Can't imagine any of Britney's songs
being inspired by Kierkegaard.

Although, you never know.
Yeah.

I think it's pretty cool your dad came
on this field trip.

Really?
Yeah. He's not Iike most parents...

...where they build these invisible walls
around them.

Oh, no, he's been behind walls.

Well, you can tell he cares about you.
He just wants to spend time with you.

I've been Iooking all over for you.
I thought we could have Iunch together?

I'm not hungry. Here, just take that.

Oh, God, sorry. It's my mother.

Take it.
She's probably just worried about you.

I'll talk to you Iater.

Hello?

Sally, honey, it's me.

Everything going good?

Brilliant.

Yeah?

Oh, Marvin, can you turn the fan on?

Yeah. Are you Iearning anything new?

No, honey, I'm sorry, you're cutting out.

Where is he?
Hold on.

What? What the hell?
It's confusing.

It's fine, I got it.
Is the weather okay?

I'm sorry. It's a universal remote.

It's supposed to do this.

Mom, what's going on in there?
Nothing. Just hit the off button, Marvin.

Can probably start the car
with this thing.

Did you know that my father--?
Honey, what?

My glasses, I can't see.

--dinosaur freak.

What? Whose father did what?

Just turn it off!
I got it. I got it.

Mom, Ray is one of our chaperones.
Look, honey, I can't hear you at all.

I'll call you back Iater.
I Iove you. I Iove you so much.

Bye.
Bye.

I got the fan!

But he's been in prison
the Iast seven years.

AII I'm saying is Ray-Ray was on the bus,
the money was on the bus.

Like you said.
So you're saying he planned it?

Ray-Ray did more than change his name
in prison.

He became a mastermind.
Yeah, well....

What a dump.
Yeah.

If my friend can't sell it quickly,
he's gonna torch it for the insurance.

Real estate market is tough out here.

Put your guns down.
You put them down.

No, no, you put your guns down.
You put your guns down.

Well, you shot the Iock of my door.

He's right.

Technically, we did shoot
the Iock off his door.

It was a nice Iock.

AII right.

Happy now, Kevin?
It's been a while, Larue.

What do you want?
We need your help.

Thank you, Mr. B.

That extra time in the French Quarter
made the day.

Isn't it the most fascinating place?

The food, the culture,
the history, the voodoo?

And to think,
we'd never have had time for all that...

...if we hadn't Ieft the museum early.

I know sometimes
I get so attached to my schedule...

...I forget to Iive in the moment.

Life is Iike a raging river, Miss M.

You never know
what's around the next bend.

Make sure your boat doesn't Ieak
and go with the flow.

That's good advice.

You know,
the next time I think I'm gonna zig...

...I might just zag.

Oh, and here's our hotel.

Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

You have exactly two hours
inside the hotel--

And I do mean inside the hotel.

--before this evening's festivities begin.

In the meantime...

...your Iuggage will be taken
into the Iobby.

You will go to the front desk, register...

...get your keys,
and settle into your rooms.

If you understand, raise your hands!

Very good.

Sorry. Parmesan.

Wish me Iuck.
Good Iuck.

You're going to die
when you see the new me.

I can't believe you're gonna do this.

Angelina's Iips
won't have anything on me.

And he'll forget all about
Iittle Miss Avril wannabe.

How far are you from
the Sheraton Hotel downtown?

Okay, I need two hours to pick up
my fireworks and get back.

AII right, guys. Come on, kids.

Nick, glad to have you back.

Yeah, cool. You're the coolest, Miss M.

Hey.
Hey.

So why did you take my bus, man?
Sorry about that, buddy.

I just got this thing about doing time--
I mean, being on time.

We had plenty of time, bro.

Did we really?

I mean, is there ever really
enough time, Nick?

I mean, honestly, what is time?

You can't save it, you can't spend it, right?
And when it's gone, it's gone.

Know what I mean? Does time even exist,
Nick? If time doesn't exist...

...and there's just the moment,
I had to seize that moment.

Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

I just don't understand
how that applies to--

It doesn't apply, Nick.
That's the beauty of it.

We're just glad you're back, man.
Cool.

Now, can I get my green duffel bag?
I'm gonna bring it in myself.

Green duffel bag. Right. Yeah.

This it?

That's it.
Thank you very much, my friend.

Cool. We're cool?

Now is not the time.

Not that cool. Right. Okay.

Larue, it's Ray.
You lying...

...dirty, Iow-Iife,
double-crossing son of a--!

I didn't double-cross anybody, all right?

I don't know how those cops got there
or how your money got on the bus.

If I had a plan,
why would I wanna give your money back?

Meet me in front of the Sheraton Hotel,
I'll hand over your money.

No way.

You know we're onto you.
You need us gone.

You ain't gonna manipulate me again.

Hold on.
Don't put me on hold!

He put you on hold?
He put me on hold.

Hey.
Hey.

How you doing?

I've been giving you a hard time
about being here.

Not at all. Listen.

If I was in your position,
I'd be doing the exact same thing.

So do you wanna get something to eat?

Yeah, that'd be great.

I gotta finish up
a Iittle bit of business.

Can I just meet you down in the Iobby
in two minutes?

Okay.
Cool. AII right.

Continue.
What was that all about?

Nothing.
Is this another one of your tricks?

Listen, all I wanna do
is give you your money back.

Good. We're gonna meet
on my turf this time, all right?

Warehouse Number 5.
Clayton and Mott. Near the bridge.

Fine. I'll be there in two hours.

Two hours?

Right now, Ray-Ray.

Listen, I've got plans.
You'll get your money.

What, you think he's Iegit?

No. Not for a second.

But I got other ideas.

Josh, right?
Yes, sir.

Josh, I've been out of the Ioop
for a while...

...and you seem Iike a standup kid.

So--
What's up?

Well, I really don't know what kids Iike
anymore, you know what I mean?

In particular, my kid.
Sally.

Yeah.

I'm Iooking for something cool to do
with her today, you know, just her and I.

Satchmo Music Festival
not working out?

It's just that with the music
and all her friends, know what I mean?

We're not gonna be able to talk.
Well, that's true.

AII right. Well, New Orleans is a cool city,
so Iet me check online.

I think there's something she will Iike.

Hey, and Iet's keep this
between you and me, right?

Nobody else's business, right?
You got it.

You know what I think is interesting?
That we both ate...

...the same part of the croissant.
Don't you think that's interesting?

Yes. I usually Iike jelly
with my croissant...

Oh, sure.
...instead of butter.

Or butter sometimes too.
Yeah.

Excuse me.
Miss M, I kind of got a favor to ask.

Sure. Anything, Mr. B.

Well, Sally and I haven't had too much
time together Iately because of my work.

I was wondering if it would be possible
for us to maybe zig instead of zag.

Maybe blow off the music festival...

...and she and I could spend
some one-on-one time together?

Why not? After all, you are a chaperone.

So she'll be in very good hands.

Thanks, Miss M. You're the best.
Thanks.

Hey, hey, hey. I did what you said.

You know,
every time she stopped talking...

...I counted, you know, in my head,
of course, the two and a half.

Boy, did she take me in.

You changed my Iife.

I'm not a big hugger, all right?

Okay. You know,
you can play that, you know...

...big, strong, Iean, handsome
in that rugged kind of way...

...devil-may-care man's man
all you want, Mr. Bradstone.

But you have a tender side
that can't be denied, my friend.

Come on. Come.

That had better be your fanny pack.
Yeah.

First thing I ever bought your mom was
one of those antique hurricane Iamps.

And I was never really
the romantic type, you know?

Matter of fact, I don't think
I actually knew what the word meant.

Until one night,
I was a bartender at this restaurant...

...in walks your mom.

She's gonna have dinner
with some Ioser, right?

Anyway, on the table,
we had one of those hurricane Iamps...

...which, by the way,
are a terrible pain to Iight.

Anyway, the Iight from that Iamp
on your mother's face...

...God, it was just magical, you know?

Right then, I knew what romance was.

Why...? Why do you think
she married you?

She said I made her Iaugh.

This is it.

Music Factory?
Yeah. Come on.

Thank you.

Excuse me.
Yeah.

You got anything cool on vinyl
Iike Sinatra, Zeppelin, Kellan Smith?

Dude, eclectic taste.

Sinatra, Zeppelin, Smith. Trifecta.

I tip my hat. Come this way.

Kellan Smith.

Yeah, you know him?
I Iove him.

Really? I heard he was really good...

...but I wasn't sure.
Thought I'd check him out.

Who you Iooking for?

Chairman of the Board, Frank Sinatra.

He's a Iittle bit before your time.
Definitely.

He's a Iittle bit before my time too.
Okay.

So I started reading up on this guy
when I was inside.

And it turns out,
we got a Iot in common, you know?

We both hit rock bottom.
He was sick and he was broke...

...and borrowing money
from this actress chick, Ava Gardner...

...who was huge at the time.
You're really into this guy.

Well, we both turned our Iives around,
you know?

And Frank's music gave me hope.

Hope Iike I hadn't had
since you were born.

Nothing? Sorry.

Why'd you do it?
What?

Leave us.

I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife.
I grew up with a Iot of the wrong people.

I was trying to find an easy way
to give you and your mom the things...

...that I thought you deserved.
I didn't wanna get caught.

How come the first five years
you were away...

...you didn't write me a single Ietter?

I thought you were better off
without me.

You know, and....

But then I started Iistening to Frank
and Dr. Marjorie.

And I started making up for Iost time.

Yeah.

I got those Ietters a Iittle Iate,
don't you think?

It's never too Iate.

You gotta have faith in people.

Faith?

Do you have any idea what our Iives
were Iike after you went away?

Mom cried for months.

For months?
Your mom cried for months?

Yeah.

And school.
Try explaining to your friends...

...why your dad can't come
to your soccer games...

...or show up for parent night
Iike the other dads.

Because he's in jail.

I know I've hurt you bad...

...and "sorry" doesn't cut it...

...but everything that I Iearned, everything,
was to find my way back to you.

This is Iovely.

The tea is Iovely.
And so is the company.

Miss Miller?

Yes?
Excuse me.

We're with
the Lafayette Police Department.

Do you know this man?

Yes. He's one of our chaperones.

Has he done something?

Just got out of prison.
He's a suspect in a bank robbery.

Your class is in danger.
Know where he is?

No.

No.

Yes. Yes.

He's out in New Orleans somewhere
with his daughter...

...probably maybe robbing a bank.

Oh, my God!
Okay, okay.

Remain calm.

Gather the kids and Iet's gather up
over here. Let's go.

You know something, Ray....

Sally, you don't have to
call me Ray, okay?

Mr. Bradstone seems kind of odd,
don't you think?

Okay. I guess Ray is a step
in the right direction.

You know something, Ray...

...I had a good time today.

Yeah?

Me too.

You should be with your friends.
I'm sure Josh is Iooking for you too.

Josh?

He's a good kid. I Iike him.

And he Iikes you too.
I see it in his eyes.

What are you going to do?

Take a walk down by the river,
enjoy the fresh air.

You go have fun.

And now some breaking news.

Ray, alias "Ray-Ray,"Bradstone,
recently released...

...after serving seven years
in federal prison for bank robbery...

...is a suspect in the robbery of the
Lafayette Central Bank this morning.

Other suspects include
Phillip "The Cat"Larue...

...Meyer "Goldy" Stentz,
and Theodore "Del"Muniz.

You're Iate. Come here. Go.
You stand right here.

Okay. When I give you the signal,
you start playing.

Okay?
Okay.

Honey? You ready?

In a second.
Okay.

--Meyer "Goldy" Stintz,
and Theodore "Del"Muniz.

The fourth suspect, Ray-Ray Bradstone,
is believed to be in New Orleans...

...after hijacking
a Redwood Junior High School bus...

...on its way to a field trip.

Lynne?

Dinner's ready.

Ready, ready.

Marvin, I'm Ieaving!
What?

I get to spend some time with my
Iittle girl today. Good time.

Oh, I'm so happy for you, Ray.

Everything is just working out
Iike you said.

You changed my Iife.
Oh, we change our own Iives, Ray.

You did that yourself.

Just stuck to the three essentials.

Confronted it, told the truth,
she's Ietting it go.

She's Ietting it go? What about you?

I don't understand.

Hey! Ray-Ray!

Looks Iike she misses me already.

Thanks for everything. Bye.

Hi.
Oh, Iook.

It's Ray Bradstone, still at Iarge.
What?

Just quoting the evening news.

So glad we got to spend
some quality time together, Ray-Ray.

Guess I'll see you
in another seven years.

Sally, I swear,
I had nothing to do with robbing that bank.

Really? So they just flashed your mug shot
on national TV...

...for your adorable smile?
I was on the bus with you.

And your fingerprints happened to be
on the keys to the getaway car? Really?

You are what you always were,
a Iying criminal.

Don't say that word.
Which one?

Liar or criminal?

I said it again.

Sally, I swear to you
I didn't rob that bank.

I mean, I was there
and I was in the car, but I swear--

I knew it.

I knew something was wrong
the moment you got on the bus.

I'm an idiot.

I actually believed you had changed.

Sally, wait.

You're not an idiot
and I have changed.

Okay. I know I've Iet you
and your mom down in the past...

...but I spent the Iast seven years of my Iife
trying to figure out how to change that.

I don't ever wanna be
away from you again.

I just need some time to figure out
how to make this right.

Please.

How are we supposed to get out?

Simple. Return the money,
Iet them take the heat for it.

What is it?

I take it back, nothing is ever simple.

Those guys are cops.

Sally...

...I need you to do me a favor, okay?
I've got nobody else.

Please.

What do you want me to do?

I need you to go to my room,
bring me the green duffel bag.

Okay?

Be careful.

Nick, what's going on?
Where is everybody?

Lockdown, maximum security,
extreme duress.

Miss M is in, Iike, cardiac Ã  Ia mode.

Why? Why are we Ieaving?
We can't Ieave yet.

You tell me. My dad's a plumber.

Oh, no, no, no. I want that bag with me.

Hey.

They're putting the class in Iockdown
and we're Ieaving.

I have to go back or they'll miss me
and that's not good for you.

Listen, I'll get rid of the money,
I'll turn myself in.

But they'll arrest you.

Sally, Iisten.

Something Dr. Marjorie said to me
about Ietting go.

Coming back here, forcing you
into something you didn't want...

...it was wrong.

What do you mean?

I was thinking about my best interests,
not yours.

The Iast thing I ever wanted to do
was put you in harm's way.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

What are you doing?
Shut up, stupid. Get in there.

Get off me! No!

You make a sound
or Iook at me cross-eyed...

...I'll shoot your old man
and shoot you in front of him.

That makes no sense.

Sure, it does.
No, it doesn't, moron.

What good would it do to shoot her
in front of him if he's already dead?

Okay, I might just shoot her now,
you Iike that?

Is that a better plan?
You Iike that better?

Then we'll have nothing to bargain
with Ray-Ray for the money.

I'm guessing you're the Ieader.
Right, sweetheart.

Process of elimination.

I Iearned about it in statistics.

And it's Ray, okay?

Just once. Ray.

You Ray-Ray Bradstone?

Ray Bradstone, yeah.

Come on in, brother.

My friend Larue says you're a bad man.

Not to underestimate you.

So I brought my friends.

Listen, guys...

...I just wanna give you back
your money.

Looks Iike it's just me and you.

Hello?

Ray-Ray?
It's just Ray, moron.

You set me up?
Better than that.

I figured even if you managed
to get past the welcoming committee...

...I'd still need a backup plan.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.

Say hello.
Daddy?

Sally? Oh, my God, okay.

Sally, Iisten, I will come for you.

Okay? You will be fine.

Do you hear me?
Daddy, please--

I can't believe how she's grown
into such a woman.

I will kill you twice if you touch her.
Okay, good.

So I can assume you're still in possession
of my money since you're not dead yet.

Larue, you are exactly
as stupid as I thought you were.

AII I wanna do is give you back
your damn money...

...and instead you kidnap my daughter,
you mo--

Hold on, Just Plain Ray.

Not in front of the kiddies.

Now, Iisten, I don't trust you
as far as I can spit you.

Okay? So here's how
we're gonna do this.

Tracy. Meredith?

Hey, how'd it go?

Ted, there you are.
Where have you been?

Am I in trouble?
No, no.

It's just, some unexpected things
have happened...

...so now we're all waiting in there.

You think I'm gonna Iose my job because
I Iet a bank robber be a chaperone?

Of course not. It not your fault.
Everything's fine.

Everything's fine.
Miss Miller.

I can't find Sally anywhere.

Well, not to worry.

I'm sure she'll be right along.

Now I've Iost a child.

And do you think that would be
a good thing? No. No. No.

You have any questions?

I got it.

Listen, my daughter's Iife
is in your hands, all right?

This is all the money I have in this world
and you're the only person I can trust.

We good?
Sure.

No cops.
Sure.

Hey, buddy.

Little Sally here's been chatting up
a storm.

I can't wait to get rid of her.

Good.

Put her in the cab
and you'll get your money.

Where is it?

I'm your insurance.

Just Iet her get in the cab,
money will appear Iike magic.

Put her in the cab.

My pleasure.

Get in there.

Smell you Iater, kid.

Stop the cab.

Stop the cab.

Stop the cab.

Something's wrong, stop the cab.

Your father said no.

Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
Stop the cab!

It's the wrong bag!

You're scary, kid, but you're
not as half as scary as your dad.

I have never had so much trouble
giving somebody money.

I'd shoot you now,
but I need that money.

Listen, this is an honest mistake.

I'm sure somehow
the bags just got switched.

It's probably on the bus. Not a big deal.
This doesn't have to go bad.

You just Iet me shoot him right now.
Shut up.

You worked it with Del and now you got
something going on with that kid.

Chip off the old block.

Listen, you don't get it, Larue.

That part of me, the guy that would
have stolen your money, the criminal...

...is gone. I got rid of him.

You guys can too.

You know, I'm not saying it's easy.

But Dr. Marjorie...

...she really helped me give birth
to my new self.

There's some great mental exercises
in the back of this book that--

You know, or maybe not.

Sally Bradstone?

I'm Officer Fuentes.
This is my partner, Augie Donaldson.

Where's your father?

No idea.

Listen, Sally, the best way to help
your father is just to tell us where he is.

He didn't do anything.

He wasn't a part of that robbery.

He's our chaperone.
He was on our bus.

Yeah, then why's he running?

And if that isn't true, concealing
a criminal's whereabouts is felony.

I don't know.

He walked me back to the hotel
then Ieft.

I don't know where he is. Honest.

AII right, I want you
with the rest the class...

...until this is resolved, understand?

Well, I'm so glad
that you're safe and sound.

Yeah, thanks.

Hey.
Hey.

Listen, this thing with your dad
must be kind of weird for you.

He's innocent.
He's just trying to straighten things out.

Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell.

Yeah.

You've got an iPhone, right?
Yeah.

Have that app that tracks any iPhone?
Yeah.

I need your help.

I gotta find my dad.

If you guys are planning an escape op,
I'll be able to help.

Me too.

I wrote a paper Iast year called...

..."The Triangulation in
the Cell Phone Jungle for Dummies"...

...and sent it to the CIA.

Did they read it?
Yeah, but dismissed it...

...saying that it was the fantasies
of an overimaginative 13-year-old.

My dad says the same thing to me.

The point is, if you need something,
or someone, found, I'm your man.

Go for it.

When was the Iast time
your father used his phone?

About 30 minutes ago.

I'm assuming a Lafayette area code.
Yes.

Where?
The Riverwalk.

Got it.
Wow, you're kind of scary.

Thanks.

Okay, okay. You're in.

Here's what I was thinking.
We have to distract Miss Miller, okay?

I have to go to the bathroom.

AII right. It's right down the hall.
Don't be Iong.

Somebody has a gun in the bathroom!

Oh, no, he's mine.

Nick, open the door.

Nick, Miss Miller is in trouble.
She needs you inside.

Me?
Yes.

Really? Cool.

Let's go.
AII right, come on.

Close the door.
Okay, what--?

Hit any button.

Which button?
Hit any button. That one.

Sit down and hang on. I can do this.
You don't even know how to drive a car.

Who's driving the bus?

Sally.

Remember what I said
about you not being fired?

You're toast.

This is kidnapping. Endangering the Iife
of a minor. I'm calling my Iawyer.

Holy crap. What happened to your Iips?

They're supposed to Iook
Iike Jessica Simpson's.

Look Iike you tried to suck honey
out of a beehive.

Keep going straight.
Okay.

I'm calling the cops.
Red Iight.

Red Iight. Red Iight.

Yeah! This day just keeps
getting better.

Where is it?

I told you, it's probably on the bus.

Don't do that.

Don't insult my intelligence.

I've got 26 witnesses
that will swear I was on that bus...

...before the robbery even went down.

How do I know that's not the plan
with Del?

With Del?
I didn't even know Del before the robbery.

I Ieft to be with my daughter.

Oh, so now you're Father of the Year.

You don't know that kid
any more than you know Del.

"Anger dwells
only in the bosom of fools."

Einstein.

"A bullet that dwells in the brain...

...Ieaves much pain."

"Leaves much pain."

Larue.

This is it.

Pull in here.

Hold on.
Cool.

Now Iisten to me, everybody.

I've spent just enough time
with my father today to realize...

...he's not the man I thought he was.

He's made some mistakes,
but he's a good man.

At Ieast he's trying to be.

Now he's in there,
and I'm going to get him out.

But, guys, I need help.
I mean, what if it was your dad in there?

I wouldn't get off this bus
if my entire family was in that place.

So, what's the plan?
Plan?

A plan? Yes.

"AII men can see these tactics
whereby I conquer...

...but what none can see is the strategy
out of which victory is evolved."

Sun Tzu, my friends.

Let's not just do this,
Iet's step up to this.

Yeah.

Come on.

Quiet. Not so Ioud.

Guys.

Open it.

Okay.

You guys go that way, we'll go this way.
Signal us when you're ready. Got it?

Roger that.

Come on.
Let's go.

We gotta be careful.

This is scary.

For the Iast time...

...where's that money?

On the bus.

Maybe he's telling the truth.

I'm telling you, he's full of crap.

It's his mastermind brain
that's trying to trick us again.

The eagle has Ianded.

I repeat, the eagle has landed.

Okay, guys, you know what to do.

Go.

Police department,
state your emergency.

Finally. My emergency
is that I'm on the field trip from hell.

I'm having trouble understanding
what you're saying.

Are you in immediate danger?
Yes.

First of all, I think my Iips
may actually explode.

AII right. You go in that way.
I'm going this way.

My God, I'm gonna make a hideous
dead person. Please help me.

Okay, all right.

You're going down.

Now!

Let it go and move on.
The Dr. Marjorie Show. Hello?

What are you doing? Get up, man.

What is this?
Rotten kids.

Caller? Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?

Dad.
Mr. Bradstone.

Untie me.
I got it.

Got it?
Yeah.

Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

Where you going?
Don't shoot. I have the money.

Yeah? Well, Iet's see it.
It's right here.

AII right.

Looks Iike it's all there.

Let's see if I get this straight.
He has taken--

You gotta hear this.
I think it's Ray Bradstone.

Caller, hold for one minute, please.

Your kid's smarter than you, Ray-Ray.
It's Ray. Plain Ray.

Now Iet us go. You have your money.

Oh, not so fast.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a very unusual call.

It appears we have a crime in progress.

Now, we have alerted 911.

We have called....
AII units in the vicinity of 1626 Mott...

...possible shots fired,
suspicious activity.

Proceed with extreme caution.
Let's go.

--and see what we hear.

Ray wasn't part of that robbery,
was he?

No.

That doesn't mean he didn't set it up
to rip us off for sending him to prison.

You are the reason
my dad went to jail?

No, Sally, that's on me.

They just Iet me take the fall alone.
My dad's innocent.

AII he wants is to be a father again.

Oh, yeah?

That really brings a tear to my eye.

You're dead.
No!

Bye-bye, Ray-Ray.
Nobody move! Drop your weapon!

Drop it!

Cuff him.
AII right, Iet's go.

Don't move. Hands behind your back.
Let's go.

Bye-bye, Larue.
You got Iucky this time, Ray.

Move out, move out.

Well, Iadies and gentlemen,
I think that's a first for me.

And maybe all of radio.

We just heard the apprehension
of criminals broadcast Iive on 91 .6 FM...

...The Dr. Marjorie Show.

And looks like our caller, well,
he got everything he hoped for.

Hey, hold on a second. Ray Bradstone?
Yeah.

You're under arrest for the robbery
of Lafayette National Bank.

But he's innocent.
Step back. Police matter.

I witnessed it.
Hey, you can take him off.

Wait. Hold on. What?

Apparently, the whole thing
just went down Iive on WKNO.

May even give Larue a radio show
from the slammer.

He confessed to the whole thing.

Sorry about this, Ray.
Thanks.

It turns out you were right to believe him.
He did keep his promise.

He did.

I appreciate it.

Sally.

My God, are you all right?
I'm okay. I'm all right.

Is this your idea of being a parent?
Mom, no. Please Iisten to me.

He didn't do anything wrong.
It's okay, Sally. I deserve that.

And that's for Ieaving us
seven years ago.

I deserve that too.
No.

You don't.

Trust me, Mom.

I could have you arrested
for endangering the Iives of these kids.

You could. I wouldn't blame you one bit.

Mom.

Don't you think he spent
enough time in jail?

Maybe so.

Dad.
Yeah?

You remember the handshake?

Thank you, Sally.

You nervous?
Definitely.

My hands are shaking.

About the new job or the first date?

Both.

It's been a Iong time in either case.

Well, you're gonna be awesome
at both.

And just wait till you actually have a car.

You know, dates and jobs
get easier with cars.

Well, job first.
I'll worry about the car Iater.

When I get ahead of myself,
that's how I get in trouble.

Good point.

Okay, you ready?

Ready as I'm gonna be.
Okay.

Okay. Come on.

Oh, wait, wait, wait.

Hey.

Hey.

Okay. Next caller, please.

Ray-Ray--
I mean, it's just plain old Ray.

Larue?

First-time caller.
You're a sweet thing, all right.

I'm having a Iittle trouble-- Excuse me.
I'm having trouble adjusting...

...to my environment.

Well...

...you know, Larue, at this point...

...I think the best thing for you
to remember is the three essentials:

Confront it...

...be truthful...

...and sleep
with your back against the wall.
