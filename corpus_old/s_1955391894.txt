  - Thought it wasn't a date.   
  - It wasn't and it isn't.     

      Thought you said          
      he was just another       
      smooth-talking brother.   

   <i> You're going to</i>

      Mom, you know I try       
      to look my best           

     no matter where I go       
     or who I'm going with.

   <i> Aren't you supposed to be</i>   
         <i> on your date?</i>         

     I've got a few minutes     
    before I need to leave.     

     You're not checking up     
    on me now, are you, too?

     <i> You have a bad habit</i>

      <i> And if you're late</i>       
      <i> to the first date,</i>       

       <i> I can promise you</i>

        I won't be late.

Girl's got herself              
a date.                         

   - Oh.                        
   - It's not a date, Daddy.    

         He's a summer associate
         I told y'all about,    

              the one           
              from Harvard Law. 

          I mentioned           
          I worked legal aid    

and he invited me               
to a community event            
at the Gardens.                 

            - Huh.              
            - Yeah.             

        Because it doesn't get  
        more romantic than      
        broken plumbing         

and underfunded schools.        

             Woman:             
   <i> Tell me the young lady's</i>    
          <i> name again.</i>          

       Michelle Robinson.       

        She's my advisor        
     at the firm, remember?     

       <i> And tell me again</i>       
     <i> what she looks like.</i>      

      - Well, she's tall.       
      -<i> Uh-huh. What else?</i>      

   - What else                  
    would you like to know?     
   -<i> Well, where's she from?</i>    

           - Chicago.           
           -<i> Uh-huh.</i>            

     -<i> Which part? </i>             
     - The side that's          
      predominantly black.      

   -<i> Okay, so she's...? </i>        
   - ( chuckles ) Yes, Toot.    

          Her skin is           
   of the darker persuasion.    

         <i> Good. So long</i>

     <i> that really matters.</i>      

         Thanks, Toot.          

        Now, I gotta go         
       or I will be late.       

       -<i> Okay. Love you. </i>       
       - I love you, too.       

         Mr. Robinson:          
  <i> So, what's this boy's name?</i>  

     Barack Obama.              

       - Barack-a what-a?       
       - He's half white.       

               Ugh. His father's
               from Kenya       

         and his mother's white.

So, why isn't this              
a date?                         

           We work together.    
           It's inappropriate.  

Mm, maybe, but you are          
spending the day with him.      

            Yeah. The meeting   
            sounded interesting.

 Mr. Robinson:                  
<i> Well, even if</i>                  
<i> it's not a date,</i>               

  the least thing               
  you could've done is          
  run a brush through your hair.

You look

Yeah. I'm your advisor.

      Why?                      
      What did you hear?        

Some of the juniors             
said you weren't happy          
with the work.                  

They're wrong.                
They weren't disparaging you. 

They were impressed             
that an associate stood up      
for herself the way you did.    

     It's not the work.         

      I mean,                   
      it is the work.           

     It's tedious,              
     but that's to be expected. 

       Second-year associates   
       get the grunt work.      

       I can live with that.    

       I'll complain about it,  
       but I can live with it.  

         It's the trademark suit
         that's got me fuming.  

I take it you did not agree     
with the judge's decision?      

      I completely agreed       
      with the judge's decision.

          And I told Thompson   
          six months ago        

     that we would lose         
     if we tried it like        
     a trademark dispute.       

           I was basically      
           silenced for voicing 
           a dissenting opinion.

      Hmm, there's no real      
      contribution at our level.

       There's only the illusion
       of contribution.         

              ( exhales )

    Are you sure it's the firm  
    you're frustrated with?     

         Shouldn't we be getting
         to the meeting?        

      Ah, we have some time.    
      It's not for another      
      few hours.                

     - What?                    
     - I thought we'd swing     
       by the art center.       

 There's an Afro-centric exhibit
 that's supposed to be--        

                   Wait.        
                   What is this?

              ( chuckles )      
              "What is this?"   
              I don't know.     

    I mean, taken at face value,
    that's a pretty existential 
    question, Michelle.         

                 What happened  
                 to the meeting?

 It doesn't start               
 till 4:00,                     

so I thought                    
we'd see some paintings,        
maybe grab a bite to eat.       

      - ( scoffs )              
      - We don't have to.       

           Barack, you seem like
           a really sweet guy,  

           but how many times   
           do I have to tell you

             we're not          
             going out together?

Mm, well, Michelle,             
thank you for saying that.      

You seem like                   
a real sweet girl.              

 But I have to                  
 correct you.                   

We are in fact out              
and we are in fact together.    

             But not on a date. 

    - This is not a date.       
    - It doesn't have to be.    

                Barack, I don't 
                want it to be.  

You know, usually,              
women I meet                    

are willing to look past        
my hideous appearance           

  and get to know               
  the real me.                  

               If I thought     
               you were hideous,

           I wouldn't have      
           set you up with Gina.

         Gina's very attractive.

Now, that's true.               
Gina is very attractive.        

             This is not a date.

   That's okay.                 
   I'll-- I'll go               
   at your pace.                

                Barack, there's 
                no pace to go at

        because there's         
        no anything to speak of.

               I am your advisor
               at our law firm. 

    - It would be tacky.        
    - You keep saying that.     

  - And you keep ignoring it.   
  - For good reason.            

You're my advisor insomuch      
as you introduce me around      
at the beginning of the month   

and you show me how to use      
the coffee machine,             

which, by the way,              
I still can't figure out,       

   so some advisor.             

 Secondly,                      
 it's not our law firm.         

  It's your law firm.           

I'm just here                   
for the summer.                 

          And while you're here,
          it's inappropriate.   

So, you think                   
I'm attractive enough           

 - to set up with               
  your prettiest friend?        
 - You think she's that pretty? 

You and I share a lot           
of the same interests.          

               I don't know     
               that that's true.

    - We both love Chicago.     
    - I get it.                 

               You think we have
               a lot in common. 

        And maybe we do.        
        Maybe we can be friends.

   But if you                   
   can't understand this,       
   then you can't understand me.

  It's hard enough being a woman
  at a giant corporate law firm.

                For all the talk
                of equality that
                goes around     

                 and all those  
                 filled quotas, 

            I'm still surrounded
            by mostly men.      

     So, I gotta work           
     just a little bit harder   
     to earn everyone's respect.

          I gotta work          
          a little bit harder   
          to be taken seriously.

                Now add on      
                that I'm black. 

          All that extra work   
          I put in to compensate
          for being a woman?    

         Being black erases that
         and brings me back down
         to zero.               

             So, now I'm working
             double-time        

    just to be seen for who I am
    and what I'm capable of.    

        Now, how's it gonna look
        to a guy like Thompson  

        if I swoop in           
        and start dating        
        the first cute black guy

              who walks through 
              the firm's doors? 

       The liberal-minded people
       will think it's precious 

    and the closed-minded people
    will think it's pathetic.   

You think I'm cute?             

              I didn't say that.

   - Some of the secretaries    
    described you that way.     
   - Nice dodge.                

        Listen, listen,         
        we're a few blocks away.

      Why don't we go in        
      and check out the exhibit?

            I'd still like us   
            to go to the meeting
            a little later.     

                It would mean   
                a lot to me.    

                Okay, it's--    
                it's not a date.

     - Fine.                    
     - Until you say it is.     

       ( quiet chatter )        

( gasps )                       
That's Ernie Barnes.            

       You read that            
       in the brochure?         

No, no.                         
I can spot a Barnes             
a mile away.                    

        You know,               
        Barnes is a real        
        interesting brother.    

 - Did you watch "Good Times"?  
 - Not a family staple.         

                 Really?        

        There was a black family
        in Chicago that didn't  
        watch "Good Times"?     

We were more                    
of a "Brady Bunch,              
"Dick Van Dyke" kind of family. 

    Those kids on Euclid Avenue,
    man, I'm telling you        
    they had it good.           

              "Dy-no-mite!"     

  - ( chuckles )                
   Do you remember that?        
  - Yes, I remember the line.   

      The character's name      
      was J.J.                  

               Right.           

           He was kind of       
           a screwup.           

  He would steal here and there,
  couldn't read or write,       
  talked jive.                  

        You know, just a bad    
        TV stereotype, right?   

      Mm-hmm.                   

      But, see,                 
      as the show progressed,   

      J.J. developed            
      this interest in painting.

As it turned out,               
he actually had                 
a lot of talent.                

But he didn't                   
take it seriously.              

Not until his dad,              
who was this tough,             
blue-collar guy,                

encouraged him                  
to keep painting.               

He saw it                       
as his son's only way           
out of the projects.            

              What did he paint?

Black ghetto life.              

They were crisp,                
exaggerated, very colorful.     

His style                       
was a lot like these.           

     That's because Ernie Barnes
     did all the paintings      
     for the show.              

          Hmm.                  

           Michelle:            
  <i> My brother would love this.</i>  

    - Barack:<i> Craig, right? </i>    
    -<i> Yeah.</i>                     

How did you know?               

<i> I may have overheard you</i>       
<i> talking about him</i>              
<i> at the office.</i>                 

         - Stalker.             
         -<i> ( chuckles )</i>         

Yeah, but who's                 
the bigger Looney Tune?         

The stalker or the victim       
who willingly goes to a         
museum with a stalker?          

                      Willingly?

            I'm more inclined   
            to describe this as 
            a hostage situation.

I'm that bad, huh?              

                       Oh, hush.

Craig shoot hoops?              

                He's decent.    

Pick-up games?                  
Office league?                  

         He's an assistant coach
         at Illinois Tech.      

    No kidding?                 

I assume he played ball         
at school?                      

             Yeah, at Princeton,

      then for a couple of years
      in the BBL.               

      He actually               
      got drafted by the Sixers,
      but they never played him.

         - ( chuckles )         
         - What?                

I'd say "decent ballplayer"     
is a gross understatement.      

                 He was decent. 

                   Great is NBA.

     Uh, no.                    
     Good is college.           

Great is your brother.          
Superhuman is the NBA.          

I think I came                  
to my realization               

when I missed varsity           
my junior year of high school.  

Cut class for a week            
after that.                     

         - Why?                 
         - I was hapa.          

          So, in everyone's eyes
          I shouldn't have just 
          made the team,        

   I should've been the best.   

      - What's hapa?            
      - Hawaiian or mixed.      

                      Hmm.      

   Maybe they didn't            
   expect you to be the best.   

   Maybe you put that           
   expectation on yourself.     

           It makes me think    
           of Gwendolyn Brooks. 

            Barack:

       <i> What do you like</i>        
       <i> about this one?</i>         

        I guess it reminds me   
        of our house on Sundays.

  <i> The boys would be upstairs</i>   
       <i> watching football</i>       

         <i> and the girls</i>

         - Do you sing?         
         - I play.              

         - Any good?            
         - I'm not bad.         

            My Aunt Robbie      
            was a piano teacher,

             so I started young.

           - How old?           
           - Four.              

         That's young.          

    Not for my mom.             

She started us early            
on everything--                 

    reading,                    

French lessons.                 

      - You speak French?       
      - Mm.                     

     - Are you fluent?          
     - I know a few words.      

      I never would've taken you
      for a Frenchie.           

     - ( chuckles )             
     -<i> I mean, any other</i>        
     <i> </i> language but French.     

                It's just       
                so sentimental. 

( speaking French )             

            What does that mean?

It means                        
"Things are not

                 It's on me.    

                    Okay, okay. 

            And now for         
            the grand finale.   

     What, no good?             

          That was sweet of you,
          but I don't like pie. 

   No, you're mistaken.         

This is not a slice of pie.     
This is a slice of heaven.      

                   Mm.          

 Who doesn't like pie?          

       - I'm an ice cream       
        kind of girl.           
       - ( chuckles )           

                    Oh, yeah?   

               Which flavor?    

    Chocolate.                  

     - Ugh.                     
     - What, you don't like     
      chocolate ice cream?      

              I don't like      
              ice cream, period.

Now, that's weirder             
than not liking pie.            

         Not when you spend     
         a summer in high school

       working at               
       Baskin-Robbins, it's not.

                 I overdid it.  

They have Baskin-Robbins        
in Hawaii?                      

       You do know Hawaii       
       is part of these here    
       United States, don't you?

   It just seems                
   so foreign.                  

                Honolulu's      
                pretty normal.  

           Played hoops all day.

          Went to a good school.

      Then again, there's a lot 
      about my high school years

              I do not remember.

      Why?                      

            Let's just say      
            a lot of it got lost
            in a cloudy haze.   

         Oh.                    

     - Because you smoked       
      a lot of marijuana?       
     - ( chuckles )             

           Yes, because I smoked
           a lot of marijuana.  

            I had a lot         
            of growing up to do.

  One time, when I was          
  nine years old,               

   I go to this girl's          
   birthday party               

and I show up,                  
and it's me and 20 girls.       

I'm the only boy there.         

  When I asked them why,        
  they all just started         
  laughing at me.               

  I remember running            
  all the way home.             
  I was mortified.              

               What made you    
               think of that?   

I don't know.                   
It just popped in my head.      

     Could never                
     figure it out.             

     Hey, you're                
     a smart lady.              

    Why were they               
    laughing at me?             

             They probably      
             had crushes on you.

          I mean,               
          everything's backwards
          when you're little.   

           When a boy likes you,
           he pulls your hair.  

      When you like a boy,      
      you kick him in the shins.

You do any shin kicking         
back in the day?                

   If you were on the playground
   and you were brown and cute, 
   watch out.                   

      You, uh, doing any        
      shin kicking these days?  

         Are you inquiring      
         about my personal life?

           I might be.          

   - Well, the answer is no.    
   - Hmm.                       

       Tell me more about       
       your grade school        
       Casanova years.          

       ( laughs )               
       No.                      

    No, no.                     
    I couldn't have             
    been less popular.          

The kids in Indonesia           
used to throw me in the swamp   
and call me Blackberry.         

               Indonesia?       

Yeah, I lived in Jakarta        
for a few years.                

    I'm not kidding.            

  We had crocodiles             
  in the backyard.              

          But-- but--           
          but why were you      
          living there?         

         I mean, how did you    
         end up there?          

Lolo, my mother's ex-husband,   
was from there                  

     and went back              
     for work.                  

    We went with him.           

              But where was     
              your dad?         

  ( exhales )                   
  He was back in Kenya.         

    And you didn't wanna        
    live with him?              

     It wasn't an option.       

               Anyway, I didn't 
               have to suffer   

            at the hands        
            of my Indonesian    
            tormentors for long.

          I moved back to Hawaii
          when I was 10.        

      My mother wanted me       
      to get a better education.

          Well?                 

         Did you?               

                I don't know.   

          How would you rate    
          my level of education?

 You're like that               
 jive-talking stereotype        
 from "Good Times."             

             So, what about you?

       What about me?           

         Well, you're Ivy League
         through and through.   

Craig got                       
the natural smarts.             

I just worked                   
my butt off.                    

            I'm sure your mother
            made sure of that.  

    She never had to.           

    Education was always        
    priority number one.        

   My dad would stand           
   for nothing less,            

  and there was no way          
  Craig and I were gonna        
  disappoint him.               

              What's he like?   

He's the greatest man           
in the world.                   

   He told us                   
   from day one                 

education was the key           
to our happiness                

    and he didn't               
    let us forget it.           

             What's he do       
             for a living?      

Operations engineer             
for the water department.       

Basically,                      
he fixes the boilers.           

He's been there                 
since '68.                      

      That must be where you get
      your work ethic.          

  ( chuckles )                  
  You don't know                
  the half of it.               

        Well, tell me, then.    

You're asking                   
a lot of questions.             

          ( sighs )             
          You don't have to     
          answer them, Michelle.

Can you keep what's said        
outside the office              

 outside the office?            

             Michelle,          
             I've been trying   

              to get you        
              outside the office
              for a month now.  

     I'm serious.               

                Yes. Absolutely.

   My dad has MS.               

              That why          
              you live at home? 

It's better to be there         
and to help out.                

He's on crutches now.           

Still gets himself              
to work every day.              

    You know, they are lucky    
    to have a daughter like you.

I'm lucky to have               
parents like them.              

  Is your mother                
  still alive?                  

                  Hmm, oh, yeah.

         Still in Jakarta.      
         She's a wonderful lady.

 -<i> But you don't see her much? </i> 
 - Nah, she has her own life.   

               But she's        
               brilliant, warm. 

               Truly wonderful. 

   - And she's white?           
   - ( chuckles ) Snow white.   

                Born in         
                Wichita, Kansas.

    - You were born in '60?     
    - '61.                      

       Hmm.                     

        A white woman           
        and a black man         

getting married                 
and having a kid back then.     

They were                       
ahead of their time.            

You want the God's honest       
truth about my folks?           

            - Sure.             
            - Okay.             

     My mother thought          
     Harry Belafonte            

      was the most handsome man 
      on the face of the planet.

 - Yeah, I'd say chocolate was  
  her favorite flavor, too.     
 - ( both laughing )            

            No, really, I think 
            their attraction    
            was that simple.    

          My father looked like 
          Nat King Cole         

       and my mother            
       looked like Patsy Cline. 

       ( drums playing )        

          Okay.                 

           Man: Hey!            

      ( people whooping )       

      -<i> ( drumming ends ) </i>      
      -<i> ( people cheer )</i>        

      <i> ( Barack laughing )</i>      

        <i> Not bad at all,</i>        
        <i> Miss Robinson.</i>         

       - Those drummers         
        were incredible.        
       - Yeah, they were.       

      - I wonder if             
       they were African.       
      - Why?                    

                 Well, it can be
                 a ritual.      

      I was part of one         
      while visiting my         
      family's village in Kenya.

  - What were the rituals for?  
  - Eh, prayer, mostly.         

          Do you believe in God?

You like to go straight         
for the jugular, don't you?     

You have a real nice jugular. 
 Real defined, real sexy.       
Watch it, now.                

Growing up, we went             
to church on Sundays,           

 but I don't know.              

I believe in some sort          
of guiding spirit.              

But I also think                
God helps those who             
help themselves.                

I think I saw that            
 on a bumper sticker somewhere. 
That's how you know it's good.

                       Ah.      

And your religious              
proclivities?                   

            Let's just say      
            I'm still evolving. 

    - What were you raised?     
    - Nothing, really.          

         My mom didn't associate
         with any one religion. 

And your father?                
Was he like you?                

About the only thing            
my father and I had in common   

      was that we both          
      went to Harvard.          

        The only difference is  
        he got kicked out.      

   - You still got two years.   
   - ( chuckles )               

       Think that's enough time 
       for me to develop a      
       drinking problem         

       and burn through         
       all my student loans?    

       You don't like           
       talking about him.       

 - Well, there isn't            
  much to say, unfortunately.   
 - That can't be true.          

            It is true.         

  - His life is incomplete...   
  -<i> ( gentle splash )</i>           

              ...in every       
              imaginable way.   

          He married my mother, 
          they had me, he left. 

               Went to Harvard, 
               got kicked out,  

              never got his PhD.

          Got a job with        
          the Kenyan government,

                  got fired,    

             never found        
             a stable job again.

       Had a few too many drinks
       at a bar one night,      

           got behind the wheel,
           never made it home.  

        He died when he was 46. 
        His life was incomplete.

             Even his tombstone 
             is blank.          

     - No one bothered          
      to have it engraved.      
     - No one bothered?         

       All that family          
       over there?              

           No one had the money.

<i> ( gentle splashing )</i>           

    You'll do it.               

When you have the money,        
you'll go back there            

and have                        
his name engraved.              

           You think you know me
           well enough to make  
           that prediction?     

     No.                        

But I am                        
a pretty hopeful person,        

 so I'll just say               
 I hope you do it.

Dying to see this movie.        

             Sounds             
             interesting enough.

Blick, Thompson, and Cohen      
were talking about it           
in the office.                  

      <i> And Thompson said</i>        
      <i> the film might be racist</i> 
      <i> towards white people.</i>    

              No, he didn't.    

    He didn't mean              
    anything by it.             

He's a little out of touch,     
that's all.                     

         I'm just tired of being
         two different people.  

             I played that game 
             at Princeton       

           and I played it again
           at Harvard.          

 There were white kids at school
 who would talk to me in class, 

               but if I saw them
               out on the quad  

            and they were with  
            their other friends,

   they would walk right past me
   without so much as a nod.    

<i> Now, obviously,</i>                
<i> the firm is not like that,</i>     

       but sometimes            
       when I'm leaving         
       Southside in the morning,

           headed for the Loop, 
           I feel like          

    I'm leaving Planet Black    
    and landing on Planet White.

      Come on.                  

   You got wooed                
   just like me.                

   You got wined                
   and dined.                   

You saw the corporate culture,  
the racial culture.             

You knew the score              
and you still said yes.         

     <i> Are you sure it's the firm</i>
     <i> you're frustrated with?</i>   

     That's the second time     
     you asked me that question.

It's the second time            
you haven't answered it.        

        What are you suggesting?

       <i> Take the bottle cap case</i>
       <i> as an example.</i>          

   Once you made your point,    
   why bother pressing further? 

         To try and get through 
         to Thompson.           

         <i> Come on,</i>              
         <i> you knew you wouldn't.</i>

          <i> Like you said,</i>       
          <i> you're a second-year</i> 
          <i> associate.</i>           

       Thompson wants you       
       doing research,          

  interfacing with the clients, 
  preparing his arguments--     

    - the grunt work, right?    
    -<i> Right.</i>                    

      But if I don't speak up,  
      what's the alternative?   

              Shut my mouth     
              and sit there     
              looking pretty?   

      First of all,             
      you always sit there      
      looking pretty.           

         <i> Second of all,</i>        
         <i> I'm not suggesting</i>    
         <i> you silence yourself.</i> 

       I'm just wondering       
       why you chose to work    
       at a corporate firm      

  where you knew your silence   
  would be expected.            

 And, really, what I'm wondering
 is why you're wasting the fight
 you have inside you            

    on battles you can't win    
    and issues you don't        
    care about.                 

                 Excuse me?     

      You think because we spend
      one afternoon together    

           and you tried        
           to buy me a sandwich,

             you're entitled    
             to pass judgment   

          on the choices I made 
          in my life?           

     - ( sighs )                
     - You think                
       I'm wasting my life.     

              <i> Now, I never used</i>
              <i> those words.</i>     

        You didn't have         
        to use those words.     

<i> You used other ones,</i>           
<i> and they stung just as much.</i>   

                Why?            

       If you really loved      
       what you were doing,     

      would you be bothered     
      by what I said?           

                         <i> No.</i>   

         ( scoffs )             
         You'd tell me          
         to go screw myself     

         and you'd go           
         on your merry way      
         making tons of cash    

   and doing trademark law      
   for the rest of your life.   

            And how do you know 
            that's not exactly  
            what I plan to do?  

       <i> Because you spent</i>       
       <i> two years of law school</i> 
       <i> in Gannett House</i>        

         <i> working pro bono cases</i>
         <i> for poor single moms.</i> 

           <i> And my guess</i>        
           <i> is that it kills you</i>

      to know you can't         
      put the same passion      
      and intelligence          

   towards cases that           
   actually mean something.     

        You're more than welcome

            to pass judgment    
            on your own father. 

        You know what?          
        You're more than welcome
        to pass judgment on me. 

            But quite frankly,  

      it sounds like you know me
      about as little as        
      you knew him.             

   - Michelle--                 
   -<i> And the biggest offense</i>    

<i> is this is</i>                     
<i> coming from a guy</i>

      at the same corporate firm
      he's railing against.     

          Now that is the height
          of hypocrisy.         

        I apologize.            
        I meant no offense.

       - Hello!                 
       - So happy               
        to see you guys.        

    Looks like we got           
    a full house today.         

  Well, everyone heard          
  you was coming, Barack.       

We all wanted                   
to get a look at                
our Harvard man all grown up.   

    Does a year and a half      
    change a man?               

 Woman:

      Very nice to meet you.    
    - Hey, girl.                

         - I'm Janice.          
         - Hi.                  

  We was your boyfriend's ladies
  while he was working here     
  in the Gardens.               

   - Oh, we're not--            
   - Platonic ladies, child.    

     - Hey.                     
     - Don't go giving her      
       any ideas.               

We did everything together      
except the sexy stuff.          

Mm. Now this is a real man      
you got yourself here.          

 - Bernadette:<i> Mm-hmm... </i>       
 - Just going right over there. 

          <i> ( chatter )</i>          

        - Woman:<i> Hi! </i>           
        - Tommy, my man.        

    B.!                         
    ( chuckles )                

  - Always so good to see you.  
  - Janice:<i> Yo, Rafiqa!</i>         

            This Barack's woman,
            Michelle.           

                Mm, he done well
                for himself.    

 - Welcome!                     
 - Janice, we're not together.  

You saying this Barack's girl?
No, Kyle, this Barack's woman.

   - Michelle.                  
   - Y'all married and shit?    

      Kyle, watch your mouth.   
      Your ass in church.       

   ( muttering )                

        - Y'all married?        
        - No.                   

          We're not together    
          at all.               

    Let me tell you             
    a little something          
    about Barack.               

My son Lawan wanted             
to be in the navy               

since he was playing            
with toy boats in the tub.      

But growing up                  
in the Gardens, whoo!           

Little by little,               
the place was getting to him.   

And he was starting to get      
the same ideas as every other   
young Negro around here,        

  thinking there                
  ain't no place for them       
  outside these walls.          

  And even if there was,        
  ain't no way out.             

Well,                           
then comes Barack,              

and every time                  
he come by the house            
to talk business,               

  <i> he sets aside a little time</i>  
     <i> to talk with my Lawan</i>     

       <i> about navy boats.</i>       

Now, I don't even               
know how Barack knew            
about navy boats,               

and he could've been            
making up names,                
for all I know.                 

The USS this                    
and the USS that.               

It didn't matter.               

   He kept Lawan                
   interested.                  

He told my boy                  
that he could be anything       

   if he worked                 
   hard enough.                 

You see, he didn't have         
a father to tell him that.      

And you know what?              

   - He made it out.            
   -<i> ( Bernadette chuckles )</i>    

    My son is sailing           
    across the seas             

         on the USS Dakota.     

    Bernadette:<i> He looking</i>      
   <i> all fly and professional</i>    
   <i> in his military uniform.</i>    

Hands off, girl.                

That's my boy                   
you're talking about.           

    <i> ( Janice and Bernadette</i>    
          <i> chuckling )</i>          

          Tommy:<i> All right,</i>     
         <i> afternoon, everybody.</i> 
         <i> Afternoon.</i>            

    - Crowd: Good afternoon!    
    -<i> Afternoon. Right,</i>         
    <i>  right, right.</i>             

 Okay, now, today,              
 you know we're here to         
 discuss the community center.  

    - ( scoffs )                
     What community center?     
    -<i> Look, I know.</i>             

   I know the city's decision   
   was a disappointment,        
   all right?                   

              Lord, Tommy.      
              It was more than  
              a disappointment. 

    It was six months           
    of our lives down the drain.

       ( crowd agreeing )       

    Okay, hold on.              
    Everybody, just hold on.    

    It was a disappointment.    
    But it wasn't all bad.      

  See, now, we got ourselves    
  not one, not two, but three   
  foundations                   

  to fund our                   
  community center programs     
  when the time is right.       

  - And I got that in writing.  
  - ( crowd grousing )          

   Now, how in God's name       
   are they supposed to fund    
   our community center programs

            when we ain't got   
            no community center?

              All:              
         That's right!          

   Well, that's the dilemma     
   we're here today to solve.   

           Now, what we         
           have to do first     

   is take a look at            
   why the city council said no.

     Well, what difference      
     does it make?              

  They say no                   
  to everything we ask for.     

    Now, now, that's just       
    not always true, Curtis.    

Now, we got that job center     
up and running.                 

We got people's apartments      
on hold for them while          
they rehabbing.                 

              Look, all I know  
              is this--         

       Senator Torrance         
       got himself a state grant

       to build a church        
       that he's gonna preach in

         <i> and Alderman Sayid</i>    
         <i> helped him get it.</i>    

             Crowd:             
      <i> Tell him, tell him!</i>      
           <i> Tell him!</i>           

      Meanwhile, my little girls
      can't go but a mile       
      up the road to play       

     for all the gangs          
     running around the Gardens,

             pushing they drugs,

littering they garbage,         

shooting they guns like         
this is the Wild West           
or something.                   

          Shoot, our kids       
          can't even go play    
          in they friends' house

               across the street
               at the gates.    

      - Man:<i> Nope. </i>             
      - The senator got         
       himself a church.        

         Our kids got themselves
         the shaft.             

              All:              
         That's right!          

         ( chattering )         

      Okay, okay, okay, okay,   
      that's a lot of--         

     that's a lot of issues     
     to address,                

      - and I know better       
       than anyone else.        
      - Man:<i> Mm!</i>                

Come on, now,                   
I've devoted my life            
to helping this community,      

 - but we got to stay focused.  
 - Woman:<i> That's right.</i>         

    Look, we got to take        
    our anger and channel it    

      towards the goals         
      we setting.               

    - Right now, that's         
     the community center.      
    - Woman:<i> Tell them, Tommy.</i>  

     Now, you know              
     from past experiences      
     we got things done         

      because we honed in       
      on one issue,             

       we pressed,              
       we squeezed,             

     and we screamed until      
     somebody finally listened. 

    It's taking too long.       
    We tired of screaming!      

    - Well, then ain't          
     nothing gonna change.      
    -<i> Well, maybe it can't!</i>     

           - Huh?               
           - No way.            

      Well, look,               
      I disagree.               

    And I'm sure                
    our guest here              
    disagrees, too,             

because I seem to recall        
when he was standing here       

    <i> in my position</i>             
    <i> by this podium</i>             
    <i> a year and a half ago,</i>     

      <i> y'all got something done.</i>

           I seem to recall     
           with his guidance,   

            your patience       
            and persistence,    

            y'all got that      
            asbestos problem    
            cleared up.         

   - Woman:<i> That's true. </i>       
   - Got them toilets fixed.    

       The pipes cleaned.       

<i> Now, I know</i>                    
<i> when times were tough,</i>         

this brother right here         

    had a lot                   
    of motivational             
    words for us,               

and I'm gonna ask him           
to come up and say              
a few right now,                

'cause I'ma tell you            
something.                      

We might be down                
for the count...                

 but we ain't out.              

 Brother Barack.                

  -<i> Why don't you come on up? </i>  
  - ( applause )                

   - It's all you.              
   - Thanks, bro. Thank you.    

          - All right.          
          -<i> Thank you.</i>          

    -<i> You know,</i>                 
    <i> </i> it's good to be back.     
    - ( chuckles )              

        It's good to see        
        all of you.             

      ( sniffs, chuckles )      

        I missed                
        that musty smell        
        up here.                

      ( people chuckling,       
          chattering )          

 Looks like Pastor Mike hasn't  
 gotten around to filling in    
 that hole in the roof.         

              No.               

    Think we're gonna have to   
    organize a meeting just     
    to get that leak fixed.     

        - ( chuckling )         
        - Woman:<i> Never.</i>         

         But listen.            

      I, um--                   
      I feel your pain.         

  I do. It's-- it's a part      
  of me now, that pain.         

   Sometimes, it hits me        
   like a heart attack          

hundreds of miles away          
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.    

 Now, I could be listening      
 to a lecture in class          

       or studying              
       in the library           

   or watching a movie          
   or talking to a friend.      

        - I think               
          of all of you.        
        - Woman: Mmm.           

I may have gone on              
to a different life             
at Harvard,                     

but you know                    
what I realized?                

  - I never left the Gardens.   
  - Crowd: That's right.        

    Now, Tommy deserves         
    some credit here, folks.    

Our fight with                  
the city council                
two years ago                   

        was proof that          
        these victories         
        do not come easy        

         and they don't         
         come big.              

         They are few           
         and far between.       

     But you gotta use them     
     like building blocks.      

     You know, one by one,      
     one on top of the other,   

   and little by little,        
   you got yourself a building. 

    And that's exactly          
    what you need in this case  

    is a building               
    for your community center.  

       Now, I feel              
       your disappointment.     

        But the truth is        

         you're in              
         a good position        
         right now.             

  - ( all arguing )             
  - Woman:<i> That's why we ain't</i>  
  <i>  got no community center!</i>    

         All right, all right,  
         all right.             

          Tommy got             
          funding pledges.      

 That's real.                   
 That's money down the line     
 and that's hard to secure.     

     Now, I know it's not       
     the whole package,         

    but think about it.         

      Now all you need          
      is a building.            

<i> You're halfway there.</i>          

    The council said no         
    to the building,            

    but that was before         
    you had funding pledges     

    secured with the help       
    of Brother Tommy here.      

    So, now when you remount    
    your campaign,              

     you have something         
     to bring to the table.     

      You're contributing.      

      And the folks downtown    
      who like to see us        
      contributing,             

   makes them feel like         
   the money they give you      
   is gonna be put to good use. 

      They just wanna know      
      that you care.            

  And Tommy's right             
  when he says we need to take  
  a look at why they said no.   

       Not because              
       it's the right decision, 

      but because               
      you gotta understand      
      where they're coming from.

       You've gotta understand  
       the city's motivations,  
       its self-interest        

<i> in order to align them</i>         
<i> with your own.</i>                 

        We turn self-interest   
        into mutual interest.   

       All right, so let's give 
       the council members      

       the benefit of the doubt 
       for a moment.            

  Let's say they want you       
  to have your community center.

       ( crowd grousing )       

     - Mm.                      
     - Barack:<i> Okay, okay.</i>      

     But let's say for a moment 
     that we got some good folks
     on that council            

     and they'd like            
     to see your kids have      
     a place to go after school.

  - Woman:<i> Yeah, right. </i>        
  - Barack:<i> Now, I believe</i>      
  <i>  there probably are a few.</i>   

     So, if we've got some      
     good-hearted folks there...

            why can't they get  
            your funding request
            approved?           

   - Getting paid to say no.    
   - Barack:<i> Okay, Curtis.</i>      

    I hear you, I hear you.     
    Anyone else?                

      - Don't care enough.      
      - All right.              

        Any other ideas?        

          Maybe they don't think
          they can.             

          ( chatter )           

      That's what               
      I'm thinking, Kyle.       

I don't think they believe      
they can get it done            

even if they wanted to.         

They know developers            
don't wanna build               
in the Gardens.                 

<i> There's nothing in it</i>          
<i> for them.</i>                      

<i> No stores,</i>                     
<i> no economy.</i>                    

These council members           
don't necessarily want          
the answer to be no.            

   They just believe            
   it will be.                  

             Curtis:            
            <i> So, what are you</i>   
            <i> proposing, Barack?</i> 

       That we build            
       the damn thing ourselves?

          Almost.               
          Almost, Curtis.       

   Now, Tommy and I             
   have been discussing this,   

  and we both think             
  you might wanna consider      
  changing the goal slightly.   

<i> Refocus your efforts on</i>        
<i> obtaining a land designation.</i>  

    Now, if you                 
    control the land,           

    you can cut a deal          
    with one developer          

    to build everything         
    in the area                 

   on the condition             
   that one of the buildings    
   be the community center.     

<i> Now, that's more jobs,</i>         

         more stores,           

     and a community center     
     for your children.         

       They just gonna say no   
       like they say no to      
       everything else!         

Now, we gotta stop thinking     
the word "no" is the end        
of the line, Curtis.            

   "No" is just a word.         

 You flip those letters around, 
 you get an entirely            
 different word.                

        - "On."                 
        - That's right.         

       -<i> As in carry on.</i>        
       <i>  ( chuckles ) </i>          
       -<i> Yeah, all right.</i>       

      Say it with me, now.      

       - Carry on.              
       - Crowd: Carry on.       

   - They say "no," we say...   
   - Crowd: "Carry on."         

    - They say "no," we say...  
    - Crowd: "Carry on!"        

    - Carry on, carry on.       
    - ( cheering, applause )    

     That's it.                 
     There you go.              

         You know,              
         Harold Washington...   

       - Woman:<i> My man. </i>        
       - Yeah.                  

    Harold Washington           
    was one of the reasons      
    I moved to Chicago.         

             Woman:             
       <i> Hmm, was he, now?</i>       

  When I first came here,       
  every barber shop             

    and chicken shack           
    on the Southside            

had a squeaky-clean picture     
of him hanging up on the wall   
for everyone to see.            

 - Man:<i> He's right about that. </i> 
 - Woman:<i> They all do.</i>          

     Chicago's first            
     black mayor.               

  - He was our mayor.           
  - Woman:<i> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</i>  

Yeah.                         
But even Mayor Washington     
 disappointed in some respects. 

     He had to face             
     the great truth            
     of our country--           

    that it's not easy          
    to get things done.         

 You know, the founders         
 made it that way on purpose.   

    They made it messy...       

    so that no one law,         

    no one government,          
    no one man,                 

  could decide the fate         
  of everything and everyone.   

   In very simple terms,        

  we got a heck of a lot        
  of different people           

   with a heck of a lot         
   of different agendas.        

But I also believe              
that people, most people,       

      are basically,            
      at their core,            
      good people.              

     So, if at first            
     we don't understand        
     their agenda,              

      city council,             
      the aldermen,             

  and the state senator...      

      we have to try            
      our hardest               

to understand                   
who they are                    

and what they need.             

  We have to let go             
  of judgment.                  

    That's a lesson...          

    I learned today             
    from a friend.              

<i> No matter what we think</i>        
<i> about someone...</i>               

<i> we never truly know</i>            
<i> what it's like to walk</i>         
<i> in their shoes.</i>                

     But we have to try.        

<i> You know, whether</i>              
<i> it's a colleague,</i>              
<i> a family member,</i>               

or a particular opponent--      

     well, especially           
     our opponents.             

Because where their needs       
align with our needs...         

    is where                    
    things get done.            

    Now, that's America.        

    Just a bunch                
    of different states.        

<i> States of land,</i>                

<i> states of mind,</i>                

<i> states of people.</i>              

    And it's up to us,          
    all of us,                  

    to keep all those           
    different states...         

          united.               

    <i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>    

         ( screeching )         

            Thanks              
            for inviting me.    

         It's been a while      
         since I've had         

      that kind of connection   
      to real-life struggle.    

                 Me, too.       

    In high school,             
    my typing teacher           
    gave me an A-.              

( chuckles )                    

I wrote her a letter every day  
until she changed it to an A.   

    I celebrated                
    all day long.               

  But that night,               
  I couldn't sleep.             

I kept asking myself            
over and over again,            

  "Did I even                   
  deserve the A?"               

  Sometimes, I forget           
  why I'm fighting.             

  Or even                       
  that I am fighting.           

I didn't know I was             
wrestling with myself           
about the firm.                 

       I understand that.       

You think you're                
real smooth, don't you?         

               Why?             

Did you know you were           
speaking today?                 

                      <i> No!</i>      

          Well, not exactly.    

     I knew there was           
     a decent chance, yeah.     

     Mm-hmm.                    

Pretty good setting             
to bring a girl.                

Surrounded by people            
who adore you,                  

people who                      
might tell this girl            
heart-tugging stories           

about how you                   
inspired their sons             
to join the navy.               

    And an inspirational        
    speech that had everybody   
    in awe, Mr. Obama.          

            Including you?      

         It wasn't bad.         

     You sounded                
     a little professorial.     

          ( chuckles )          

        But you definitely      
        have a knack for        
        making speeches.        

               Thank you.       

         You know,              
         that being said,       

         it didn't hurt         
         to take you there      
         on our first date.     

       - Our first what?        
       - You heard me.          

      ( chuckles )              
      You must have misspoken,  

          because               
          according to you,     

          this isn't a date     
          until I say so.       

      You know, if you don't    
      wanna spend any more time 
      with me today,            

         I'll respect it.       

        I won't like it,        
        but I'll respect        
        your wishes.            

           But if you wanna     
           keep hanging,        

let's call it a date            
and move on to the next event.  

     - Next event?              
     - Drinks and a movie.      

        You think               
        you're real smooth.     

           And real cute.       

         I don't know           
         about the cute part.   

            I mean, they did    
            look good on Dumbo. 

    - I'd rather be Dumbo       
     than the Wicked Queen.     
    - Wicked Queen?             

       Now, you can't just say  
       any old wicked queen.    

      - From which movie?       
      - ( both chuckling )

            Barack:

     Michelle:<i> "You and I,"</i>     
    <i> "Sunshine of My Life,"</i>     
        <i> "Superstition."</i>        

  - Barack:<i> All great songs. </i>   
  - His best.                   

           Huh, not better than 
           "Higher Ground."     

      "Talking Book"            
      was the first album       
      I ever heard.             

And if it was the last,         
I'd be set for life.            

 - That's how brilliant it is.  
 - Mm-mm.                       

   ( chuckles )                 
   Man.                         

Well, at least we can agree     
that Stevie is the best.        

      - Mm.                     
      - At least we can         
       start from there.        

Okay, so what about             
that moment in the church       

before the meeting?             

                    Which?      

I think                         
Bernadette said it              

about you finally               
dating a sister.                

       ( both chuckling )       

                Who knows       
                with those two? 

     - They love to gossip.     
     - Is it true?              

      - Is what true?           
      - That you never          
       date black women?        

      - Not true.               
      - But you did             
       date white women.        

             I've dated a couple
             white women, yes.  

Which do you prefer?            

                  ( chuckles )  

Come on, buster.                
Now it's your turn              
to ante up.                     

       My girlfriend            
       at Columbia was white.   

     Okay.                      

          It was pretty serious.

What was her name?              

             Jennifer.          

       How long were            
       you with Jennifer?       

                   A little over
                   two years.   

          ( chuckles )          
          Mm-hmm.               

       Columbia was a...        

          strange time          
          in my life.           

        I was reading a lot,    
        figuring stuff out.     

        I had very few friends. 

    - Except for Jennifer.      
    - ( chuckles ) Exactly.     

          She was lovely.       

          She really was.       

        She was very caring.    

        Kept me company         
        when I was lonely.      

      We fell into that         
      private little universe   
      couples can fall into     

      where you develop         
      your own kind of language 
      and customs, you know?    

      I've never had that       
      with anyone               

         other than             
         my own family.         

                 It's nice.     

               Anyway,          

           when we went to visit
           her family,          

      they were incredibly      
      gracious to me.           

      Very nice,                
      open-minded people.       

      But I looked around       
      at all the pictures       
      on the walls,             

      all the white faces,      

    and I knew I couldn't spend 
    any more of my life         

      living as an outsider.    

         Does that answer       
         your question?         

       So, why did you          
       come to Chicago?         

          To try and make       
          a difference.         

   Mm-hmm.                      

Thought I would, too.           

     Thought maybe              
     I'd work civil cases.      

         Help women,            
         empower them.          

       Being at                 
       that meeting today       

      aroused some              
      of those old dreams.      

     Lit some kind of fire.     

But those                       
last couple years,              

the corporate firms             
descend upon the campus         

like a pack of wolves.          

   And they're so appealing.    

                ( chuckles )    

  I wanted to be in a position  
  to pay off my loans,          

       pay my folks back,       

         live a little,         

          enjoy life.           

           There's nothing wrong
           with that.           

    There's nothing wrong       
    with it until there is.     

                Yeah, I know    
                what you mean.  

        I just feel             
        like something else     
        is pulling at me.       

        I wonder                
        if I can write books    

      or hold                   
      a position of influence   
      in civil rights.          

          - Politics?           
          - Maybe.              

    I just want to do more.     

          Yeah, so do I.        

     And maybe just wanting it  
     is enough for now.         

                 Hm.            

       Whatever I end up doing, 

       I take comfort in knowing
       I can't do much worse    
       than my dad did.         

       That doesn't sound       
       like the same guy        

        who gave                
        that fancy speech       
        earlier,                

    the one who talked about    
    letting go of judgment.     

     I've noticed how you talk  
     about your father.         

That's such an angry way        
to live your life--             

judging him,                    

living your life                
against his.                    

   You're still fighting him,   

   but he's not here anymore.   

   You said earlier you felt    
   his life was incomplete.     

Every father's life             
is incomplete.                  

That's why                      
they have sons--                

to finish                       
what they started.              

  You know, my grandfather      
  was not a very generous man.  

    He could have helped        
    my dad through college,     

    but he was so terrified     
    of getting into debt,       

     he refused to lend him     
     any money.                 

So my dad had                   
to drop out of school           

<i> after a year.</i>                  

<i> Took a while,</i>                  

<i> but he forgave</i>                 
<i> my grandfather.</i>                

        Then he got his job     
        with the city...        

        and he has spent        
        the rest of his life    

    working in that boiler room,

          making sure           
          not to do to his kids 

           what his father      
           did to him.          

          You have to forgive   
          your father...        

<i> so your anger doesn't</i>          
<i> turn you into him.</i>             

<i> You have to forgive him...</i>     

<i> so you can be</i>                  
<i> better than him.</i>               

<i> That's what he would want.</i>     

      <i> ( sirens wailing )</i>       

   <i> ( police radio chatter )</i>    

          ( yelling )           

              Man:

        <i> Let me through!</i>        

       Let me through!          
       Get off me, get off me!  

Get his arm!                    
Get his arm!

Gary:<i> Shut up.</i>                

   <i> Gary, that's enough, man!</i>   

        ( man choking )         

       - Cop #2:<i> Gary,</i>          
       <i>  that's enough! </i>        
       - Gary: Shut up!

      <i> ( glass shattering,</i>      
      <i> objects crashing )</i>       

       Michelle:                
       What's the matter?       

        Be careful!             
        I feel a riot coming on.

        - Ugh.                  
        - ( chuckling )         

        - I'm gonna use         
          the restroom.         
        - Okay.                 

             Woman:             
   <i> No, I don't wanna see it.</i>   

              Man:              
           <i> Michelle?</i>           

           It is you.           

      Your height               
      gave you away.            

      ( Michelle laughs )       

      Avery, what are you       
      doing here?               

Uh, picking up groceries.       

          What do you think?    
          We came to the movies.

           - You did?           
           - Yeah.              

We partners do that             
from time to time.              

And, uh--                       

and on occasion,                
we bring along our wives.       

              Laura, this is    
              Michelle Robinson,

           one of our more      
           tenacious associates.

Michelle,                       
this is my wife, Laura.         

              So pleased to make
              your acquaintance.

      Likewise, likewise.       

         I think Avery          
         mentions you           

         at least               
         a dozen times          
         a day.                 

Are you here alone?             

         Me? Um, I'm...         

        <i> with a friend.</i>         

          <i> Actually...</i>          

         I have to go.          

              What did you think
              of the film?      

       What did I think?        
       I liked it.              

Well, all the hoopla            
leading up to it,               

I had to see for myself.        

    Oh, what did you think?     

     Compelling,                
     though the ending          
     was puzzling               

          <i> and more than</i>        
          <i> a little infuriating.</i>

                Ha! Barack!     

            - Avery.            
            - Wow!              

     Having a Sidley Austin     
     reunion, here.             

          <i> ( nervous laughter )</i> 
          <i> We just came from a</i>  
          <i> community meeting</i>    

      that we attended          
      as colleagues and friends,

      and just thought          
      it might be a good idea   
      to stop and see the movie,

    since it's something        
    everybody was talking about.

       Um, thank you for that   
       illuminating explanation.

                  Laura,        

<i> this is one of our</i>             
<i> summer associates,</i>             

<i> a very talented young man,</i>     

   Barack Obama.                

Very pleased to make            
your acquaintance.              

         Pleasure's all mine.   

         So, you got around     
         to seeing the movie,   
         I take it.             

     Yes, yes, we did.          

In fact, I was just             
explaining to Michelle          

how angry that ending           
made me.                        

       Why would the deliveryman
       have thrown the trash can

              through his       
              employer's window?

<i> He must have known</i>             
<i> his actions would cause</i>        
<i> the mob to riot.</i>               

<i> It seemed</i>                      
<i> totally irrational.</i>            

Let me put it to you            
another way, Avery.             

                   I'm all ears.

        <i> If Mookie hadn't thrown</i>
        <i> the trash can,</i>         

maybe the crowd would have      
turned on Sal and his sons.     

So, instead of the store        
being destroyed,                

they might be dead.             

And Mookie knew                 
the insurance                   

would cover the damage          
to the store.                   

He was saving Sal's life.       

   I never would have considered
   that perspective, Barack.    

       See, that's why we need  
       a guy like you full-time.

                  ( chuckles )  

         Michelle, make sure    
         to treat him real good.

We want him sticking around.    

      We'll see you both Monday.

         - Good night.          
         - Good night.          

              Night.            

You know I only said that       
to make Avery feel better.      

Mookie threw that trash can     
because he was fucking angry.   

  ( chuckles )                  

What a coincidence              
seeing him here.                

That's really wild.             

        It wasn't a coincidence.

          It was cosmic justice.

            I knew damn well    
            going out with you  

          was the wrong thing   
          to do-- pun intended--

       and don't even try       
       to convince me otherwise,
       Barack,                  

         because there's nothing
         you can say.           

     Nothing?                   

 I can't tell you that          
 Avery doesn't give a hoot      

  about seeing                  
  the two of us out?            

         "Make sure to treat him
         real good."            

      That was not okay, Barack.

           By any measure.      

           It was smarmy.       

        You don't think that was
        laced with anything?    

        You don't think he meant
        anything by that?       

       Maybe he did.            
       So, what?                

      First thing Monday morning

      he's gonna spread         
      this juicy little anecdote

            around the office   
            like wildfire.      

          You know, none of this
          would have happened   

      if you had just respected 
      the boundaries I laid out,

              but you refused.  

       You didn't respect       
       our working relationship.

         And now that's all     
         there's going to be.   

     <i> ( laughter, chatter )</i>     

I don't want any...             

    <i> ( door opens, closes )</i>     

    It's pretty good.           

    ( laughs )                  
    You want some?              

             Sure.
