<i>["Relax" by</i>
<i>Frankie Goes To Hollywood playing]</i>

<i>[cheers, applause]</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>["Relax" continues]</i>

<i>[indistinct mouthing]</i>

<i>["Relax" fades out]</i>

<i>Oh! New York City!</i>

<i>Yeah, dudes!</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Oh! Thank you guys so much for being here.</i>
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>Ah! I'm so happy to be</i>
<i>away from my family.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>Man, I got two little boys</i>

<i>and a cisgendered male husband. Boo!</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Man, it is all dicks, all day.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>My house has less feminine energy</i>
<i>than Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</i>

<i>Holy shit.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>I am the only clam on the menu</i>
<i>at Long Dong Silver.</i>

<i>Oh my God,</i>
<i>and the last baby I pumped out of me</i>

<i>was ten pounds, ten ounces.</i>

<i>-[audience cheering]</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

<i>Boom!</i>

<i>Talk about a vag blaster.</i>

<i>Wrecked my cold cut combo.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Slayed my sausage wallet.</i>

<i>Destroyed my whisker biscuit.</i>

<i>Bloodier than a Mexican town</i>
<i>in a drug war.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Oh, like a goddamn IED went off</i>
<i>down there, folks.</i>

<i>And here's the dealâ€¦</i>

<i>I have had not one,</i>

<i>I have had two episiotomies.</i>

<i>-[audience] Ooh!</i>
<i>-Do you know what that is?</i>

<i>[woman] Yes!</i>

<i>It's where they cut your taint.</i>

<i>Now, it's an "ain't."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Just a big HOV lane for waste.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Oh my God, it's so messed up.</i>

<i>After you have a baby,</i>

<i>the doctors have the nerve to ask you</i>

<i>if you think you </i>might <i>have</i>
<i>postpartum depression.</i>

<i>They go, "It's a mental illness.</i>
<i>It's a syndrome." [smacking lips]</i>

<i>I'm like, "If you're not depressed</i>
<i>after having a baby,</i>

<i>you're mentally ill."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Because, first of all, okay,</i>

<i>you're fatter than Bert Kreischer.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>-That was for you. You, you, you!</i>
<i>-[audience cheering]</i>

<i>[laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>You're so fucking fat, and--</i>

<i>and because I've squeezed people</i>
<i>out of me,</i>

<i>every time I cough,</i>

<i>IÂ pee just a tiny little bit.</i>

<i>Not a lot, it's just a whisper,</i>

<i>just aÂ dollop, just a mwah!</i>

<i>Kisses my panty just like,</i>

<i>"You're gorgeous."</i>
<i>Just a little something.</i>

<i>Not enough to merit</i>
<i>an underwear change in my mindâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦so instead I walk around</i>
<i>in piss pants most of the time.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>And I don't change my underwear</i>

<i>because I'm exhausted.</i>

<i>I'm too tired</i>
<i>because I have a three-year-old</i>

<i>and a six-year-old boy,</i>

<i>and they want too much</i>
<i>from parents these days. Too much.</i>

<i>The school asked me</i>
<i>to pack nut-free granola bars.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Nut</i>

<i>free</i>

<i>granola bars.</i>

<i>I'm like, "Do you mean a KitKat?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Here's a Thermos full of Mountain Dew."</i>

<i>"Enjoy him today."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Insanity. They gave my three-year-old,</i>
my three-year-old,<i> a progress report.</i>

<i>I'm like, "Can we hold off on paperwork</i>
<i>'till he knows the difference between</i>

<i>spaghetti and 'pasketti'? How about that?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And the teacher said,</i>
<i>"Julian is a nice boy,</i>

<i>but he doesn't play with all the kids."</i>

<i>And I said, "Good."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Have you seen</i>
<i>these goddamn losers in his class?"</i>

<i>[laughter, cheers]</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Well,</i>

<i>I'd say spotting a loser is more important</i>
<i>than learning to read, don't you think?</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>It's too much.Â It's too much.</i>

<i>I want to be an '80s mom. An '80s mom.</i>

<i>Oh! They had it the best, didn't they?</i>

<i>There used to be a commercial</i>
<i>that came on at ten o'clock at night</i>

<i>that said, "It's tenÂ p.m.,</i>
<i>do you know where your children are?"</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>They had to remind bitches</i>
<i>they even had kids.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Talk about the Golden Age of motherhood.</i>

<i>Now they tell moms,Â "Oh, your kid</i>
<i>has to eat the rainbow of vegetables."</i>

<i>"Eat the rainbow of vegetables."</i>

<i>Dude, growing up,</i>
<i>I ate two colors, red and yellow.</i>

<i>McDonald's, three times a week at least.</i>

<i>-At least.</i>
<i>-[cheers]</i>

<i>Those Happy Meals</i>
<i>sure make you sad, don't they?</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>All the salt and preservatives.</i>

<i>"Mommy, my left arm is numb."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[groans]</i>
<i>"Is this what delicious feels like? Ah."</i>

<i>The '80s, man.</i>

<i>There was no "mindful parenting."</i>

<i>My mom used to cuss me out</i>
<i>in theÂ JCPenney parking lot</i>

<i>in Hungarianâ€¦</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>â€¦screaming at me--</i>

<i>[shouting in Hungarian]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Which translates to,</i>

<i>"I'm gonna hit your head so hard</i>

<i>you're gonna shit your pants."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>Yeah, you could hit your kid.</i>
<i>Hell, you could hit other people's kids.</i>

<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-That wasn't illegal.</i>

<i>You were doing that mom a favor.</i>

<i>[belches]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>You see me. You really, really see me.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>[cheers continue]</i>

<i>Now, I'm not saying</i>
<i>that the '80s were perfect</i>

<i>or that child abuse is rightâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦but here's the thingâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦well, you need a little strife</i>
<i>in your life,</i>

<i>a little struggle,</i>

<i>a little "putting a brick inÂ it."</i>

<i>Why? To create resilience.</i>

<i>Resilience!</i>

<i>Okay? '80s weren't perfect,</i>
<i>but I'll tell you what they didn't have.</i>

<i>There were no uh, safe spaces.</i>
<i>[imitating fart]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>There were no trigger warnings.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And there were</i>
<i>no fucking peanut allergies.</i>

<i>[audience cheering, applauding]</i>

<i>Wellâ€¦</i>

<i>Why? Because for thousands of years,</i>

<i>the only people who could have children</i>

<i>were ones who could hunt for food,</i>

<i>build shelter,</i>

<i>and fight saber-toothed tigers.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Now, there are people having kids</i>

<i>who can't eat wheat.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[laughter continues]</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>[mocking] "Uh, but Christina,</i>
<i>it's an allergy."</i>

<i>"You don't know."</i>

<i>Well, I do know I ain't fucking a guy</i>
<i>that's scared of toast.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Let me tell you something,</i>
<i>my favorite question</i>

<i>when I go to a restaurant</i>
<i>is when a waiter asks me,</i>

<i>"Ma'am, do you have</i>
<i>any food sensitivities?"</i>

<i>I can't fucking laugh hard enough.</i>

<i>[laughing] I'm like, "No, boo-boo, no."</i>

<i>[snorts] "No, I haveâ€¦</i>
<i>I have zero 'sensitivities'</i>

<i>"to anything fucking everâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦because I'm Generation X."</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I'm Gen X, man.</i>

<i>I grew up playing on scorching hot</i>
<i>metal monkey bars in the middle of summer.</i>

<i>And when I fell,</i>
<i>it wasn't onto foam or mulch,</i>

<i>I fell onto a dead hobo.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Yes, I grew up swimming in the L.A. River.</i>

<i>It's not a river, it's a sewer.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And back in the day, everyone got bullied.</i>

<i>Everyone got bullied.</i>

<i>And then when you went home</i>
<i>and told your parents about it,</i>

<i>they would bully you</i>
<i>for not standing up for yourself.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Fuck it, dude, I'm an '80s mom.</i>
<i>I'm an '80s mom.</i>

<i>I'll tell you what, I let my kids jump</i>
<i>from the couch to the coffee tableâ€¦</i>

<i>[shouting] â€¦'cause that's</i>
<i>what baby teeth are for!</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>[audience continues applauding]</i>

<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

<i>[imitating preacher] Yes, I believe.</i>
<i>I believeâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦ that eating floor Cheerios</i>
<i>makes you strong.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>"Better than vaccine!"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>There's a game in my house,</i>

<i>if there's food on the floor</i>
<i>and you can beat the dog to it,</i>

<i>it's yours.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I teach my children how to lie properly.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Well, that's an important life skill,</i>

<i>'cause one day</i>
<i>they're gonna grow up and have a boss.</i>

<i>Oh, honesty is the best policy?</i>

<i>[laughing]</i>

<i>Not when I've spent</i>
<i>two hours of company time onÂ TikTok.</i>

<i>-[continues laughing]</i>
<i>-[cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I let my children watch cartoons.</i>

<i>Old school ones, bros. Old school.</i>

<i>I go Bugs Bunny, bam!</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>-Woody Woodpecker, boom!</i>
<i>-[cheers]</i>

<i>PepÃ© Le Pew.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>[mocking] "Oh, but, Christina,</i>
<i>PepÃ©'s problematic."</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Well, I talk to my kids and I say,</i>

<i>"Hey, not all French are rapists."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"But they do smell like shit."</i>

<i>[audience cheering, applauding]</i>

<i>[chuckling] Soâ€¦</i>

<i>Mmm. Back when I lived in California,</i>

<i>uh, there's a helmet law that says</i>

<i>every time your kid rides a bicycle,</i>

<i>you have to put a helmet on them,</i>

<i>and I did it</i>

<i>because I'm an amazing fucking mom.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>But in my heart,</i>

<i>in my soul,</i>

<i>I'd be likeâ€¦</i>

<i>[tuts] "This fucking pussy shit."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Are you joking? A helmet?</i>

<i>To ride a bicycle?</i>

<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>more embarrassing in life?</i>

<i>Right? 'Cause growing up in school,</i>
<i>there was that one kid</i>

<i>who wore a helmet and didn't ride a bike,</i>

<i>if you catch my--</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Maybe tore tickets at the movie theater.</i>

<i>[audience] Ooh!</i>

<i>Ooh! Maybe collected</i>
<i>shopping carts in the parking lot.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>We had a kid like that at our school</i>
<i>and we called him Double Dare.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Relax, relax, you can laugh</i>
<i>at Double Dare.</i>

<i>He's totally fine now.</i>

<i>Yeah, he's totally normal.</i>

<i>It turns out, back in the day,</i>

<i>they were just giving him the wrong pills.</i>

<i>-[woman in the audience] Oh my God!</i>
<i>-Yeah,</i>

<i>so through the miracle of modern medicine,</i>

<i>they made him detarded.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Thank you so much.</i>

<i>God, that was such a good joke.</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>That's my favorite joke.</i>

<i>[applause continues]</i>

<i>I know you'll say that shit on Monday.</i>

<i>You're gonna be like,</i>
<i>"That Cindy, she's detarded."</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Now,</i>

<i>I like my kids to watch </i>Sesame Street

<i>'cause that's what I grew up on.</i>

<i>Right? </i>Sesame Street.<i> Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah. But um, have you seen</i>
Sesame Street<i> lately?</i>

<i>Ugh! The neighborhood's gone to shit.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>You guys are gonna die. You're gonna die.</i>

<i>So, first of all,</i>

<i>Cookie Monster,Â Cookie Monster,</i>

<i>gluttonous piece of shit that taught you</i>
<i>not to overdo it with the sweets,</i>

<i>now eats fruit and vegetables.</i>

<i>[screams]</i>

<i>[audience] Boo!</i>

<i>I know, what's next?</i>

<i>What's next, Big Bird's gone free range?</i>
<i>Fuck that!</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>No, Oscar the Grouch,Â Oscar the Grouch,</i>

<i>the first hoarder you ever knew,</i>
<i>lived in his own filth in a trash can,</i>

<i>now lives in a recycling bin.</i>

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-[man in the audience] Boo!</i>

<i>Oh my God, you know he's gonna be</i>
<i>one of these assholes who wears patchouli.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>You know those people? And--</i>

<i>They don't buy regular deodorant,</i>
<i>instead they buy Tom's.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Oh! Then they have to tell you about it.</i>

<i>[mocking] "Oh, well, you know, Christina,</i>
<i>the regular deodorant."</i>

<i>"Regular, regular deodorant--"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"The regular deodorant has</i>
<i>aluminum in itâ€¦"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"â€¦and the aluminum gives you Alzheimer's."</i>

<i>Like, yeah,</i>
<i>we all wish you had Alzheimer's</i>

<i>because you smell</i>
<i>like Dog the Bounty Hunter's cuntâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦with your fake-ass deodorant.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Okay, Bert and Ernie,</i>

<i>still not gayâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦but they are polyamorous.</i>

<i>It's my favorite. I love polyamory.</i>

<i>Iâ€¦ I live for that shit.</i>

<i>I love when somebody is like,</i>

<i>"I'm polyamorous."</i>

<i>[tuts] Like, "Bitch, back in the '90s,</i>
<i>you was just a ho." You know what I mean?</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Right? You're just horny.</i>
<i>That's not an identity.</i>

<i>Okay, but there's--Â Okay,</i>
<i>there's a new character on the street.</i>

<i>[shrieking]</i>

<i>Um, her name is Julia and she's autistic.</i>

<i>[audience] Aw!</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Aw!</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>No, f-- you guys, that is like--</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[laughing] I got so fucking excited</i>

<i>that </i>Sesame Street
<i>put out an autistic puppet.</i>

<i>Dude, I was stoked. I got so happy.</i>

<i>It was like when a new</i>
<i>Tourette's documentary comes outâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughing] â€¦you're all fucking excited,</i>
<i>and then you--</i>

<i>you watch it, and two minutes in, you go,</i>
<i>"Oh God, these people are suffering."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"I'm a bad person."</i>

<i>[chuckles] So I started watching Julia,</i>
<i>the autistic character, and Iâ€¦</i>

<i>I really like her.Â I really like her.</i>

<i>I learned about autism, which was cool,</i>
<i>and what I like best is that,</i>

<i>sometimes she gets upset</i>
<i>and she hits Elmoâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦which is greatÂ 'cause fuck Elmo, right?</i>

<i>He's the worst.Â He's the worst.</i>

<i>He's always laughing at his own shit.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[mocking] "Elmo loves you." [laughing]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Elmo goes potty." [laughing]</i>

<i>He sounds like a nervous porno actress.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Like you know when the casting director</i>
<i>will shoot the interview before the scene?</i>

<i>Don't act like you don't know</i>
<i>what the fuck I'm talking about.</i>

<i>[man in the audience</i>
<i>laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>Right, the scumbag, and he's always likeâ€¦</i>

<i>[moans]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[in deep voice] "What are you gonna</i>
<i>do for us today, sweetie?"</i>

<i>[in high voice] Then she'll be like,</i>

<i>"I'm gonna do</i>
<i>my first blow-bang triple anal."</i>

<i>[laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>[laughing turns into crying]</i>

<i>"Sounds hot." [moans]</i>

<i>Oh my God.</i>

<i>And like, here's the deal, man.</i>
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

<i>Oh God.</i>

<i>[inhaling deeply]</i>

<i>Here's the deal, is that I, um, I used to,</i>

<i>I used to be able to laugh</i>
<i>at that girl, you know,</i>

<i>and now I'm a fucking middle-aged mom</i>

<i>and I have all these feelings</i>
<i>like empathy and stuffâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦because you start to realize, like,</i>

<i>how life is just a lot of luck</i>

<i>and then a series of choices,</i>

<i>and like, I could have been that girl.</i>

<i>I should have been that porno girl.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>You know, with my childhood,</i>

<i>I should've been that girl,</i>
<i>and really, in the scheme of things,</i>

<i>stand-up comedy, not that bright</i>
<i>of a choice of life, right?</i>

<i>Like, it goes, fucking, porno actress,</i>
<i>stand-up comedian. Not smart. Butâ€¦</i>

<i>So I became a mom and uhâ€¦</i>

<i>How do I put this? Iâ€¦ I just want to,</i>

<i>I want to do better</i>
<i>than what was given to me.</i>

<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>I don't blame my parents forÂ anything.</i>

<i>Do I? Yeah, I do.</i>

<i>-But the thing is--</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>Well, you know, I justâ€¦</i>
<i>I just want to be a better parent</i>

<i>than what I had and, um-- Yeah.</i>

<i>Oh, thanks. One person.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Okay, okay, you're on board, yeah.</i>

<i>Umâ€¦</i>

<i>Or as my therapist calls itâ€¦</i>

<i>[mocking] â€¦"I am breaking</i>
<i>the cycle of--" [chuckles]</i>

<i>"I'm breaking the cycle</i>
<i>of generational trauma."</i>

<i>I am breaking the cycle</i>
<i>of generational trauma,</i>

<i>and it's a lot of work, okay?</i>

<i>So here's what I've done so far.</i>
<i>It's like a decade in therapy,</i>

<i>and then every day,</i>

<i>I wake up, I practice my gratitude,</i>

<i>and then I drink my coffee.</i>

<i>I take a shit.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I exercise,</i>

<i>uh, because the endorphins from</i>
<i>exercise help fight depression,</i>

<i>and then I adhere to a low-carbohydrate,</i>
<i>high-protein diet.</i>

<i>I meditate twice a day.</i>

<i>I feel all my dumb feelingsâ€¦</i>

<i>and I am still so fucked up, like I'm--</i>

<i>[laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>I'm so fucking crazy.</i>

<i>[cheers, applause]</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>-Whoo!</i>
<i>-[cheers continue]</i>

<i>But-- [laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>But I'm trying, and I'm in the game,</i>

<i>and I'm gonna do it, man.</i>

<i>I'm gonna do it. Yeah.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Yeah, 'cause my childhood was wacky.</i>

<i>Like, put it this way, like, growing up,</i>

<i>I couldn't understandâ€¦</i>
<i>I couldn't understand those people</i>

<i>who lived at home in their twenties.</i>

<i>You know, like, dude,</i>
<i>I wanted out at six, bro.</i>

<i>-I was like--</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>"Where's my letter to Hogwarts?</i>
<i>Get me the fuck out of this."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>You know, I would have rather lived</i>

<i>with those bitches from </i>The Facts of Life

<i>and get scissored by that lesbo, Jo,</i>
<i>remember Jo?</i>

<i>-You guys know Jo was a lesbo, right?</i>
<i>-[man in the audience] Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, 'cause she had a ponytail.</i>

<i>And she was a mechanic.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>-A pussy mechanic, am I right? Yeah!</i>
<i>-[cheers]</i>

<i>No, I hated my mom. I hated her so much.</i>

<i>She wasâ€¦ oh, just the worst.</i>

<i>Borderline and schizophrenic,</i>
<i>which wouldn't have been so bad,</i>

<i>but she was mean.</i>

<i>I mean, even bin Laden would be like,</i>
<i>"Oh, this bitch is evil. This--"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'll give you an example, when I was five,</i>
<i>I was singing in the kitchen,</i>

<i>and she goes, "Oh, Christica,</i>

<i>you should never sing."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I know, and people today are like,</i>

<i>"Christina, is it hard</i>
<i>being a woman in comedy?"</i>

<i>"I'm like, no, dude.</i>
<i>I was raised by Simon Cowell."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Shit don't phase me, bro."</i>

<i>When I was 12,</i>
<i>when I was 12-years-old,</i>

<i>she stole my identity</i>
<i>and bought fur coats.</i>

<i>Fur coats!</i>

<i>I'm from Los Angeles,</i>

<i>it is 85 degrees Christmas day.</i>

<i>Forget it.</i>
<i>Here's the thing, I've forgiven her,</i>

<i>and lately,</i>
<i>we've been getting along so well.</i>

<i>In 2015, she died.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>[applause, cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>And now I wear fur coats to get Froyo.</i>

<i>It's a win-win.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>God, she was so angry.</i>

<i>Ever know somebody</i>
<i>that could get angry at anything?</i>

<i>Yes, like a retail worker would be like,</i>
<i>"Have a nice day."</i>

<i>"You have a nice fucking day!"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[singing "Entry of the Gladiators"]</i>

<i>'Cause her first language was Hungarian,</i>

<i>she couldn'tÂ pronounce</i>
<i>certain words in English,</i>

<i>and um, you ever hate somebody so much,</i>

<i>you don't correct their English</i>
<i>for like 40 years?</i>

<i>Dude, I would let her</i>
<i>say things wrong all the time.</i>

<i>She couldn't say the word "aluminum foil."</i>

<i>She would call it "alufolia."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'd say, "Yeah, pass me the 'alufolia.'</i>
<i>Wrap that shit."</i>

<i>"Wrap that chicken in 'alufolia,' bitch.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go."</i>

<i>If it was cold outside,</i>
<i>she would say, "It's very crispy outside."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'd be like, "Yeah, crispy, crunchy,</i>
<i>like a potato chip. You got this."</i>

<i>"Go say that at your job interview.</i>
<i>Go ahead, bitch."</i>

<i>Fucking hated her.</i>
<i>Then every now and then,</i>

<i>she'd get frustrated with me</i>
<i>and kick me out,</i>

<i>and then I'd go live with my dad,</i>
<i>and my dad was a party.</i>

<i>-[woman] Yeah!</i>
<i>-You guys, he is 75-years-old</i>

<i>and still slanging that dick.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Recently, I asked him, I was like,</i>

<i>"Dad, how many women</i>
<i>do you think you've been with?"</i>

<i>He goes, "Not enough."</i>

<i>[cheers, laughter]</i>

<i>[laughing]</i>

<i>Now, there's a cool guy.</i>

<i>[imitating guitar]</i>

<i>The coolest.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Yeah, dog.</i>

<i>In 1985, more women saw</i>
<i>my dad's dick than </i>Ghostbusters.

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And I loved living with him because</i>
<i>on a school night, I was eight-years-old,</i>

<i>and he would take me out</i>
<i>to bars and nightclubs.</i>

<i>Oh, and I loved it.</i>

<i>I loved dancing. I just loved it.</i>

<i>But I was so young.</i>

<i>I thought the song "White Lines"</i>
<i>was about coloring.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>But my favorite song to dance to</i>

<i>in the whole world was</i>
Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

<i>-[audience cheering]</i>
-Relax.<i> Do you guys remember that?</i>

<i>â™ª Relax, don't do itÂ â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you wantâ€¦ â™ª</i>
Yeah.

<i>Do you know what that song is about?</i>

<i>It's about gay guys doing itâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦and trying not to finish too soon. Now--</i>

<i>Meanwhile, my eight-year-old ass is like,</i>

<i>â™ª When you wanna comeâ€¦Â â™ª</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>[moaning] </i>â™ª Come!Â â™ª

<i>â™ª Yeah!Â â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoaâ€¦Â â™ª</i>

<i>[vocalizing]</i>

<i>[laughing hysterically]</i>

<i>[chuckles] Um, so, a while ago,</i>

<i>my husband was like,</i>

<i>"Babe, babe, I think your dad</i>
<i>might be an alcoholic."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I was like, "That makes so much sense."</i>

<i>When you grow up around weird,</i>
<i>you don't know it's weird.</i>

<i>You think that everybody's dad takes them</i>
<i>to bars and nightclubs on a school night</i>

<i>at eight-years-old and lets them dance</i>
<i>to a hardcore gay sex anthems.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Uh, but I'm super stoked you guys</i>
<i>because recently, he got remarried.</i>

<i>-[cheers]</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

<i>Yes, for the fifth time.</i>

<i>[applause, cheers]</i>

<i>He's 75-years-old</i>
<i>and he married a 34-year-oldâ€¦</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>â€¦Vietnamese ladyâ€¦</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>â€¦he met online.</i>

<i>[chuckling] Yeah.</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>I don't knowâ€¦ I don't know</i>
<i>if that's a marriage or an adoptionâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>but that bitch came with a receipt,</i>
<i>you know that.</i>

<i>Could you imagine?</i>
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

<i>I mean, maybe she wants the Green Card,</i>
<i>and he wants free mani-pedis.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>Oh, shut the fuck up, she's my Viet mom,</i>
<i>I can say what I want. Shut up.</i>

<i>But let me tell you, I'm so--</i>

<i>I'm so grateful</i>
<i>to have this woman in my life</i>

<i>because otherwise,</i>
<i>I would have to listen to him.</i>

<i>Oh God. Is there anything worse</i>
<i>than a phone call from your toxic parent?</i>

<i>Ugh! Ugh! They don't even ask you</i>
<i>anything about you.</i>

<i>No questions, nothing.</i>

<i>All my dad wants to talk about</i>

<i>is the achievements</i>
<i>of the Hungarian people.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Oh my God, he's so slick.</i>

<i>"Christica,</i>

<i>you know who invented Rubik's Cube?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"A Hungarian."</i>

<i>"You know who invented the ballpoint pen?"</i>

<i>"A Hungarian."</i>

<i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"Did a Hungarian invent suicide?"</i>

<i>"I'm gonna blow my brains out.</i>
<i>I can't. I can't."</i>

<i>"I can't."</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>But then he drinks a little on the call,</i>

<i>and then it gets better.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>He'll be like,</i>

<i>"Christica,</i>

<i>every time you burp,</i>

<i>you are cheating your asshole."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[audience continues laughing]</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>[groans] Then I'm back in. I'm back in.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>But then he drinks too much on the call.</i>

<i>[mimicking deflation]</i>

<i>Now, I have a theory</i>
<i>that all dads know one historical fact</i>

<i>that they like to repeat over and over.</i>

<i>Now, my father escaped</i>
<i>from Communist Hungary in 1969,</i>

<i>so his fact is a little dark.</i>

<i>Here it goes.</i>

<i>"Christicaâ€¦</i>

<i>you know,</i>

<i>everybody thinks</i>
<i>Hitler killed the most people."</i>

<i>[scoffs]</i>

<i>"This is not true."</i>

<i>"Stalin killed</i>

<i>the most people,</i>

<i>but everybodyÂ gives Hitler all the credit</i>

<i>like he's some kind of special guy."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"He's no fucking special guy."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'm like, "What?"</i>

<i>"Are you jealous of Hitler? Is this--"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"You saying Hitler's the genocide champ?</i>
<i>Is that what I'm hearing?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>So crazy.</i>

<i>And then meanwhile,</i>
<i>cut to me at a dinner party</i>

<i>and somebody will bring up World War IIâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦and I'll be like,</i>
<i>"Actually Stalin killedâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦more people than Hitler."</i>

<i>[applause, cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>"Why do you think Hitler's a special guy?</i>
<i>He's not such a special fucking guy."</i>

<i>[inhaling deeply] Ugh!</i>

<i>It's such a drag</i>
<i>'cause I gotta listen to him.</i>

<i>I gotta listen to him</i>
<i>'cause I'm an only child,</i>

<i>and it's times like this</i>

<i>I wish I had</i>
<i>a 400-pound codependent sister.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>You know, just 400 pounds,</i>

<i>always watching the ID channel,</i>

<i>convinced she's gonna get</i>
<i>murdered and raped.</i>

<i>I'm like, "Murdered, maybe." [chuckling]</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Because, New York, I'm a good person.</i>

<i>I'm not a great one.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>I might fake pick up</i>
<i>dog shit from time to time.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Every time my dog takes a shit,</i>
<i>that's when the neighbor has to come out,</i>

<i>and I always forget bags,</i>
<i>and I gotta do theater.</i>

<i>[mocking] "Hold on, I got it</i>

<i>somewhere, I don't know."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>The minute she walks away,</i>
<i>"Fuck your lawn, bitch."</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>You got a gardener, you got that.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Good person, not a great one.</i>

<i>I refuse to give people my age</i>

<i>rides to the airport.</i>

<i>Oh my God.</i>
<i>Listen, if you're in your mid-forties</i>

<i>and you can't get yourself</i>

<i>to the airport, bro,</i>
<i>that means you don't have like $50.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>You don't have $50.</i>

<i>You should stay home</i>
<i>and work on that resume, okay?</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Good person, not a great one.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>I never</i>

<i>want to hear</i>
<i>about the triathlon you're preparing for.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Oh my God,</i>
<i>is there anything worse than that?</i>

<i>The person has to tell you,</i>
<i>"No, Christina."</i>

<i>[mocking] "First I swim two kilometers,</i>

<i>and then I bike 90 kilometers,</i>

<i>and then I run 20 kilometers."</i>

<i>And I'm like, "What the fuck?"</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>"What the fuck?"</i>

<i>"What the fuck</i>

<i>is a kilometer, dude?"</i>

<i>"I don't do math."</i>

<i>Good person, not a great one.</i>

<i>Not a great one.</i>

<i>-[audience applauding, cheering]</i>
<i>-Not perfect.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>Just trying to break the cycle</i>
<i>of generational trauma.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>So when I became a mother,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

<i>Nobody has a blueprint for that.</i>

<i>Yeah, so I did what everybody should do</i>

<i>and I looked to social media.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Oh my God, everybody lies on social media,</i>

<i>but moms, those bitches lie the most.</i>

<i>Right? What do the moms always say?</i>

<i>"Being a mom,</i>
<i>it's the best job in the world."</i>

<i>And look, I love my children</i>

<i>more than life,</i>

<i>but the </i>job <i>of being a mom,</i>

<i>it is not the best.</i>

<i>In fact, I would argue</i>
<i>having no job is the best job.</i>

<i>[applause, cheers]</i>

<i>Or Instagram model, that's a job.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>You guys, there is a man on Instagram</i>

<i>who makes millions of dollars</i>

<i>as an adult baby diaper wearer.</i>

<i>Let me rephrase that.</i>

<i>I follow a guy on Instagram.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>He's so great.</i>

<i>He's so fat and sweaty,</i>

<i>and his chest looks like a pork chop,</i>

<i>like a raw pork chop, that's been dropped</i>
<i>on a barber shop floor.</i>

<i>-[man in the audience] Oh my God!</i>
<i>-I love it. He does the best poses, dude.</i>

<i>It's always him like against a brick wall.</i>

<i>He does these coquettish little poses.</i>

<i>He'll be like,</i>

<i>"No."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Love it. I love him.</i>

<i>I love him.</i>

<i>Do you think, growing up as a kid,</i>

<i>every time he cried, his dad was like,</i>

<i>"Don't be a baby."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Look who's crying now, Daddy."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Anyway, I was such an idiot</i>
<i>when I became a mom.</i>

<i>I believed all those sayings</i>
<i>people throw around about children,</i>

<i>you know like,</i>
<i>"Kids say the darndest things."</i>

<i>Not mine.</i>

<i>Mine say the meanest shit all the time.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Last week Ellis called me a "dishbag."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I was like, "Uh, no, it'sÂ douchebag."</i>

<i>"Open your mouth when you speak, son."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Show some respect."</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

<i>Douche.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Then my little one,</i>
<i>I was changing the three-year-old's diaper</i>

<i>and he had a big old doody in there,</i>

<i>and he goes,</i>

<i>"Do you see your family in there?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[audience continues laughing]</i>

<i>I go, "Yeah, my mom."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Uh! They're so abusive.</i>

<i>They're like abusive husbands</i>
<i>with the questions all the time.</i>

<i>"Where are you going?</i>
<i>What are you doing? What's Lexapro?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Oh my God.</i>

<i>They walked in on me naked,</i>

<i>just started laughing.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>The little one pointed. That's fucked up.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I taught him that one.</i>
<i>I taught him that one.</i>

<i>Oh my God.</i>

<i>They've destroyed my house, okay?</i>

<i>So far, I've replaced two toilets</i>

<i>'cause they flush cars down those.</i>

<i>I walked in on the six-year-old</i>
<i>coloring in the grouting in between tiles</i>

<i>in permanent marker.</i>

<i>And there's piss everywhere.</i>

<i>Everywhere. I walk in on them peeing</i>
<i>like they're being arrested, just--</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Oh! I'm like a piss sommelier</i>
<i>now, you know?</i>

<i>I walk through the house, I'm like,</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. [sniffs]</i>
<i>"That's three-year-old boy, very good."</i>

<i>[sniffs] "That's six-year-old."</i>

<i>[sniffs] "Oh, forty-two-year-old</i>
<i>male comic, that's an interesting one."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>-[applause]</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

<i>Ah.</i>

<i>And let me tell you something</i>
<i>if you don't have kids yet, okay?</i>

<i>Marriage,</i>

<i>I used to believe that marriage was 50/50.</i>

<i>And then you have kids.</i>

<i>That shit ain't 50/50, okay?</i>
<i>Fuck what you heard.</i>

<i>It is the Mom Show, all day, every day.</i>

<i>Fucking, Mommy.</i>

<i>Mommy. Mommy.Â Mommy.Â Mommy.Â Mommy.</i>

<i>Mom. Mom.Â Mom.Â Mom.</i>

<i>I know.</i>

<i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna change my name to Daddy."</i>

<i>'Cause nobody expects shit from that guy.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Daddy gets to take a dump by himself.</i>

<i>Me, when I go to the bathroom,</i>

<i>I got a six-year-old playing</i>
<i>Legos on the ground,</i>

<i>a dog making intense eye contact.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Why do they wink at you, like--</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"What's the secret, girl?"</i>

<i>â™ª I watch you poop</i>
<i>You watch me poop â™ª</i>

<i>-â™ª I watch you poopÂ â™ª</i>
-[laughter]

<i>Ugh. Every time I go to the bathroom,</i>
<i>I got the six-year-old playingÂ Legos,</i>

<i>the dog making eye contact,</i>
<i>and a baby sitting on my lap.</i>

<i>Bonus points</i>
<i>if you breastfeed at the same time.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>That's called "The Milwaukee Milkshake."</i>
<i>You're welcome.</i>

<i>[audience laughing, applauding]</i>

<i>Oh, gosh, so, okay,</i>
<i>so I broke my ankle in Juneâ€¦</i>

<i>and some people think</i>
<i>it was my husband's fault.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And in some ways, it was.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Alright, I'll tell you the story.</i>
<i>Here's what happened.</i>

<i>So, it's in the middle of the night.</i>
<i>I'd just come home off the road.</i>

<i>I was exhausted.</i>
<i>I had the baby monitor next to me.</i>

<i>The babies used to sleep</i>
<i>on the first floor,</i>

<i>we used to sleep on the second.</i>
<i>Not anymore.</i>

<i>But anyway,</i>
<i>so the baby screams in the monitor,</i>

<i>and if you're a mother,</i>

<i>you know that when your baby cries,</i>
<i>you could be in a dead sleep</i>

<i>and you will feel that,</i>

<i>you'll feel the baby cry</i>
<i>in every cell of your being, right?</i>

<i>It's like Uma Thurman</i>

<i>in </i>Pulp Fiction.

<i>[wailing] The baby!Â The baby!</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>That's my reaction.</i>

<i>My husbandâ€¦</i>

<i>[snoring]</i>

<i>Now, my husband claims</i>

<i>he can't hearâ€¦</i>

<i>babies crying in the night.</i>

<i>Can't seem to hear</i>
<i>babies crying in the night.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, 20 houses down,</i>

<i>the Monday Night Football theme</i>
<i>can be playingâ€¦</i>

<i>[vocalizing]</i>

<i>â€¦and his dad boner can't get harderâ€¦</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>â€¦or higher.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>So anyway, I fell down the stairs</i>

<i>getting to my baby in a hurry,</i>

<i>and that's how I broke my ankle,</i>
<i>and see, that's a mother's love.</i>

<i>That's a fucking mother's love.</i>

<i>Nobody tells you this, but being a mom</i>
<i>is an emotional roller coaster.</i>

<i>Like, I go from joy, to rage,</i>

<i>to exhaustion, to exhilaration,</i>

<i>every six seconds, every day.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And just when I'm ready</i>
<i>to throw that baby in the riverâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦he smiles at me.</i>

<i>[sighs] Yeah, yeah, they smile at you</i>
<i>with those littleÂ jack-o'-lantern teethâ€¦</i>

<i>[high-pitched dinging]</i>

<i>â€¦and you're filled with so much joy,</i>
<i>you have crazy thoughts.</i>

<i>You're like-- [groaning]</i>

<i>"I want ten more!"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Come on, Tommy. We're fucking tonight!"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-[audience cheering]</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Until you watch TLC, The Learning Channel,</i>

<i>and you see</i>
<i>those Duggar assholes with theirâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦twenty kids, you're like,</i>
<i>"How are you having 20?"</i>

<i>"How is this legal?"</i>

<i>Animal Services</i>
<i>won't let you have but six cats.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I love TLC.</i>

<i>My favorite show</i>
<i>is </i>Little People, Big World.

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Wouldn't it be great if they could</i>
<i>merge </i>Little People, Big World

<i>with tiny houses?</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Little People, Appropriately Sized Houses.</i>

<i>Come on, TLC, do better!</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Everybody talks about a mother's love,</i>

<i>but nobody talks about a mother's rage,</i>

<i>and for me, that's bedtime. Oh!</i>

<i>Yeah, bedtime. Oh my God.</i>

<i>And the experts tell you</i>
<i>to have a routine, right?</i>

<i>Okay. Good. Boom.</i>
<i>Noon, we're in pajamas. Let's go.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I do it all, right?</i>
<i>I got blackout curtains,</i>

<i>I got the sound machine, I got stories,</i>

<i>and then what happens?</i>

<i>[footsteps approaching]</i>

<i>[in low voice] "I'm thirsty."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Dude, I don't know what it is</i>
<i>about this generation's hydration needs.</i>

<i>I swear my parents</i>
<i>gave me water once a week, tops.</i>

<i>We drankÂ Fresca, I think.</i>
<i>I dunno. I was dehydrated.</i>

<i>-So that's pop up number one. Number two--</i>
<i>-[footsteps approaching]</i>

<i>-[in low voice] "I gotta go poop."</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-And the third oneâ€¦</i>

<i>-[footsteps approaching]</i>
<i>-"There's a monster under my bed."</i>

<i>"Good, tell him I said hi.</i>
<i>I dunno what to tell you."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>One night,</i>

<i>my older boy popped up eight times.</i>

<i>Eight times.</i>

<i>And the rage that welled up inside of me--</i>

<i>And you can't tell a six-year-old boy--</i>

<i>I can't be like,</i>

<i>"Dude, bro, homie,</i>

<i>fuck outta here, man, what are you doing?"</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>"Scram. Kick rocks. Listen, son,</i>

<i>your dad and I have just</i>
<i>an hour and a half free time every night,</i>

<i>just an hour and a half to get highâ€¦"</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>â€¦watch </i>90 Day FiancÃ©â€¦

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>â€¦hurry fuck, and fall asleep before</i>
<i>we have to do this shit all over again."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"And, son, it is not good sex,</i>
<i>it is sad married sex."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"We don't even face each other anymore."</i>

<i>"I just kind of lay on my side,</i>

<i>and then your dad walruses up behind me."</i>

<i>-[audience laughing]</i>
<i>-[grunting]</i>

<i>[continues grunting]</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>-"I don't even get naked anymore, I justâ€¦</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦I pull my sweatpants down."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[cheers, applause]</i>

<i>Just let it happen.Â Just let it happen.</i>

<i>Goddamnit.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"I know there is no such thing</i>

<i>-as nut-free granola bars. I know it."</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>"That is bullshit."</i>

<i>"When is the next season</i>
<i>of </i>Bridgerton <i>coming out?"</i>

<i>[laughter, cheers]</i>

<i>"I mean, how long does this shit take?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"Did I buy the organic turkey slices?"</i>
<i>I reallyâ€¦</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>That's my life.</i>

<i>[inhaling deeply]</i>

<i>That's me,</i>
<i>breaking the cycle of generational trauma.</i>

<i>[applause, cheers]</i>

<i>That's what it is.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>That's what it is. I stay in the game.</i>
<i>You just gotta stay in the game, right?</i>

<i>That's all you're doing.</i>

<i>And I work on my perfectionism.</i>
<i>That's a huge problem with me.</i>

<i>You know, 'cause I compare myself</i>
<i>to those perfect moms.</i>

<i>Oh. You know those bitches?</i>

<i>Those perfect moms?</i>

<i>Oh, they got four kids</i>
<i>and somehow they're a size zero?</i>

<i>What does she say?</i>
<i>"Oh, I do intermittent fasting."</i>

<i>"Yeah, so does half the world,</i>
<i>it's called starvation, bitch."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>The worst is when she's like,</i>
<i>"My husband is my best friend."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Gross. These are the same people</i>
<i>that mouth-kiss their moms and dads.</i>

<i>I know it.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>No, your husband is not your best friend.</i>

<i>Your best friend is the person</i>
<i>you talk shit about your husband to.</i>

<i>[laughter, cheers]</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Well, anyway,</i>
<i>I will say the one thing I did right</i>

<i>is I've been married</i>
<i>to the same dude for 17 years.</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>That's right.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Seventeen years.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>I married a psychopath.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Here's how you know</i>
<i>you're with a psychopath.</i>

<i>In the middle of winter,</i>

<i>he sleeps with a fan blowing on him.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[angrily] "I'm hot! I'm hot!"</i>

<i>"Yeah, because you're a psycho,</i>

<i>and psychos have</i>
<i>a higher core body temperature</i>

<i>that allows them to stand outside naked</i>
<i>in the freezing rain with a meat cleaver."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I told our adorable cleaning lady about it</i>
<i>and she goes,</i>

<i>"Well, maybe it's because he's so hairy."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'm like, "How do you know, bitch?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Then I remembered she cleans our drains.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Poor woman, I know.Â I know.</i>

<i>Here's how you know</i>
<i>you're with a psycho, okay? Okay?</i>

<i>Look at their Netflix queue.</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>Look at what Netflix</i>
<i>is suggesting they watch next</i>

<i>'cause that's somebody's total interests.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>my husband only has two areas of interest,</i>

<i>it's either serial killersâ€¦</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>â€¦or World War II.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And he likes to watch his shows</i>
<i>as I'm drifting off to sleep at night,</i>

<i>so, I get to hear either,</i>

<i>"And the murderer only killed blond women,</i>
<i>mothers of two."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Or--</i>

<i>-[shouting in German]</i>
<i>-[laughter]</i>

<i>Did you guys know</i>
<i>that Stalin actually killedâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦more people than Hitler?</i>

<i>Did you know that?</i>

<i>[audience cheering, applauding]</i>

<i>What do they always say about psychos?</i>

<i>About psychopaths like</i>
<i>that Brian Laundrie? Remember him?</i>

<i>What do they always say?</i>
<i>They say, "Oh, he was just a regular guy."</i>

<i>"Just a regular guy."</i>

<i>Let me tell you something,</i>
<i>my husband is regular as fuck.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Super regular, okay?</i>

<i>He doesn't know what a duvet cover is.</i>

<i>Or a pergola.</i>

<i>He thinks that doing a cleanse</i>

<i>is scrubbing</i>
<i>his butthole extra in the shower.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Regular guys</i>
<i>don't understand subtlety or hints,</i>

<i>so when they ask, "Babe,</i>
<i>what do you want for your birthday?"</i>

<i>Don't go, "Oh, nothing."</i>

<i>'Cause that's what you gonna fucking get.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>But here's the deal, man. I love it.</i>

<i>I love being married to regular guy.</i>
<i>It's the best.</i>

<i>It's so fucking easy 'cause they</i>
<i>only require three things to be happy.</i>

<i>Three things. Number one, sandwiches.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Sandwiches. Just feed him</i>
<i>a sandwich every now and then.</i>

<i>Don't get fancy. No cucumbers.</i>

<i>No hummus. None of that shit.</i>

<i>Two pieces of bread and something</i>
<i>that had a heartbeat in the middle.</i>

<i>That's it. That's all he needs.</i>

<i>Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. Number two,</i>

<i>sports.</i>

<i>They gotta like sports.</i>

<i>My husband likes football. Football.</i>

<i>The game is four hours long,</i>

<i>followed by the two hour after show</i>

<i>where the severely out of shape</i>
<i>retired playersâ€¦</i>

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-â€¦sit around and talk about the game</i>

<i>we just all sawâ€¦</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>â€¦because they have brain damage</i>

<i>and it takes</i>
<i>five of their collective memoriesâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦to form one coherent memory.</i>

<i>I love it.</i>
<i>And then they have um, their dad jokes.</i>

<i>They're likeâ€¦</i>

<i>[in deep voice] "That cheerleader looks</i>
<i>more like a tight-end to me, Rick."</i>

<i>[mock laughing]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>It's like the male version of </i>The View.
<i>They love that shit.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And they're so ugly.</i>

<i>All the men are so--</i>

<i>Oh my God, they would never let a woman</i>

<i>as ugly as Lou Holtz--</i>

<i>-[laughter]</i>
<i>-The guy can barely talk. He's like--</i>

<i>[mocking Lou Holtz]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"You're right, Lou,</i>
<i>salami is an underrated meat."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[mocking Lou Holtz]</i>

<i>"Mm-hmm."</i>

<i>"Oatmeal's easy on the gums, Lou.</i>
<i>You got that right."</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>But whatever.</i>
<i>I don't bust his balls for all that.</i>

<i>Why? Because he's home</i>

<i>on the couch with the dog and the kids</i>

<i>and one lady who fucking gets it</i>
<i>because that's a good man.</i>

<i>That's right, lady. Clap for that.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>That's a good man.</i>

<i>[audience continues applauding]</i>

<i>That's the guy you marry.</i>
<i>The sports guy, the sandwich guy.</i>

<i>Now, lastly.</i>

<i>Number three on the list.</i>

<i>Sex.</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>You have to have sex</i>

<i>with your husband. Nowâ€¦</i>

<i>[sighing]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I don't pretend to be some sexed-up,</i>
<i>hot cool wife. Like I'm not, dude.</i>

<i>I'm really not.</i>

<i>I mean honestly,</i>

<i>after spending a day</i>
<i>with my three and six-year-old boys,</i>

<i>I am dryerâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦than Ruth Bader Ginsburg's pussy.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>She's dead, so that is a dusty puss.</i>

<i>I know. I don't, I don't feel sexy.</i>

<i>I feel like giving up, like just getting</i>
<i>my haircut at the dog groomer's,</i>

<i>buy all my clothes at the AutoZone,</i>

<i>like one mechanic's onesie.</i>

<i>So here's what I do, okay?</i>

<i>I put my husband</i>
<i>on a 72-hour milking schedule.</i>

<i>Every 72 hours.</i>
<i>'Cause here's what I noticed.</i>

<i>Around 72 hours is when the rage builds.</i>

<i>It's like the </i>60 Minutes <i>clock,</i>
<i>and then it--</i>

<i>[clock ticking]</i>

<i>And then somewhere around hereâ€¦</i>

<i>"This ice cream is too cold!"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>"This salt is too salty!" [groaning]</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And then I got a milk the bear.</i>
<i>I gotta milk him.</i>

<i>And I don't do it for him,</i>

<i>I do it for me</i>
<i>and the safety of our children.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And I know the moms watching this,</i>
<i>you're like,</i>

<i>"I don't,Â I don't really feel</i>
<i>like doing intercourse." Well, yeah.</i>

<i>You can just give him a handy.</i>

<i>Or as I like to call it,</i>

<i>two percent milked.</i>

<i>[laughter, applause]</i>

<i>[audience applauding, cheering]</i>

<i>So, I'll tell you a little personal story.</i>
<i>So the other nightâ€¦</i>

<i>yeah, the other night, uh,</i>

<i>my husband and I made sweet marital love,</i>

<i>and he rolls over and he goes,</i>

<i>"Are you proud of me?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I'm like, "Yeah, sure."</i>

<i>He goes, "No, are you proud of me because</i>

<i>I had to fart that whole timeâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦but I didn't out of respect for you."</i>

<i>I'm like, "Do you even see me</i>
<i>as a woman anymore?"</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I said, "Go ahead and fart.</i>
<i>The fan's on. Who cares?"</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>But that's marriage.</i>

<i>And that's what it is.</i>

<i>And being an adult</i>
<i>and having a family life,</i>

<i>it's not easy,</i>

<i>but it's a marathon.</i>

<i>Not a fucking triathlon, but a marathon.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>And what I've learned is,</i>
<i>I just have to take breaks.</i>

<i>Just take a break, come back later.</i>

<i>So what I like to do</i>

<i>is I get my nails done,</i>
<i>and I've been going</i>

<i>to the same lady for years, right?</i>

<i>So five months after</i>
<i>I had my second child,</i>

<i>five months after I gave birth,</i>

<i>I went to see her.</i>

<i>She looks at me and goes,</i>

<i>"Oh,</i>

<i>did you have the baby yet?"</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah, she goes,</i>
<i>"You look fat. You look fat."</i>

<i>Like, "Is that any way to talk</i>
<i>to your stepdaughter, you fucking bitch?"</i>

<i>-"Is that any way?"</i>
<i>-[laughter, applause]</i>

<i>[audience cheering, applauding]</i>

<i>And look,</i>
<i>I know I'm not supposed to do that accentâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦but it was so much funnier, right?</i>
<i>It was so much better. Come on!</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>You gotta do that shit.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>Okay, so, okay, so, when I broke my ankle,</i>

<i>I had like a major</i>

<i>life realization. Here's what happened.</i>

<i>I broke my ankle in four places,</i>

<i>and it was dislocated.</i>

<i>Yeah, so I'm in the emergency room,</i>

<i>and the doctor goes,</i>
<i>"We have to reset your bones."</i>

<i>"I'm gonna give you ketamine</i>
<i>so that you don't remember it."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>And then he saysâ€¦</i>

<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"You may go on a little journey."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>I was like, "Yeah, dog, that's what's up."</i>

<i>[audience cheering]</i>

<i>"Call me."</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>You know, like,</i>

<i>I've been preparing</i>
<i>for this shit my whole life.</i>

<i>"Who's a loser now, Mom? Okay."</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>Okay. So they give me the ketamine and--</i>

<i>[humming in falling tone]</i>

<i>Like, I slip into the fourth dimension,</i>

<i>and then I go</i>

<i>on a vision quest, bros, likeâ€¦</i>

<i>[cheers]</i>

<i>â€¦like a serious vision quest.</i>
<i>So I'm in the fourth dimension,</i>

<i>and Pac-Man shows up,</i>

<i>and he's wearing a saddle</i>

<i>because I live in Texas now</i>
<i>and I think that's where it came from.</i>

<i>And Pac-Man's like, "Hop on, little lady."</i>

<i>And I'm like, "Alright, Pac-Man."</i>

<i>So I get on and we're riding, right?</i>

<i>[imitating Pac-Man]</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>And I see my father,</i>

<i>but I'm full of compassionâ€¦</i>

<i>and love,</i>

<i>and I forgive him. I forgive him for him</i>

<i>not being able to be the dad</i>
<i>I wanted him to be.</i>

<i>And then I thanked him</i>
<i>for the cool historical factsâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦and I thanked him</i>
<i>for teaching me how to dance through life.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>[audience continues applauding]</i>

<i>And then,</i>

<i>so I get back on Pac-Man.</i>

<i>[imitating Pac-Man]</i>

<i>Now I see my mother,</i>

<i>and I'm full</i>
<i>of compassion for her and love,</i>

<i>and I forgive her for not being able</i>
<i>to be the mother I wanted her to be.</i>

<i>And then I thank her for the fur coatsâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦and for making me resilient.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>Resilient.</i>

<i>[audience continues applauding]</i>

<i>Because, by the time I was seven,</i>

<i>I could use the stoveâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>â€¦to light my own cigarettes.</i>

<i>[laughter, cheers]</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>[audience applauding]</i>

<i>And then I ride on.</i>

<i>[imitating Pac-Man]</i>

<i>And now I see my children,</i>

<i>my beautiful boys,</i>

<i>[inhaling] and I'm overcome</i>
<i>with love and gratitude</i>

<i>that they exist</i>
<i>and they've given me this purpose,</i>

<i>and they've made me wanna be a better</i>
<i>mother and human being every day.</i>

<i>[inhaling deeply]</i>

<i>[exhaling]</i>
<i>And then the ketamine wears offâ€¦</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

<i>â€¦and my husband is next to me and he's--</i>

<i>he's holding my hand.</i>

<i>Yeah, and I grab him</i>
<i>and I pull him close to me,</i>

<i>and his face is right here and I go,</i>

<i>I know</i>

<i>you can hear babies crying in the night.</i>

<i>[laughter]</i>

<i>-[audience applauding]</i>
<i>-Thank you, guys.</i>

<i>I love you very much. Thank you so much.</i>
