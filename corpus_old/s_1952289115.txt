Zeus.

Poseidon.

It's been many years.

What do you see?

Thunderclouds.

But no lightning.

Stolen.

What?

Do you think I took it?

Omnipotence has blinded, brother.

We are forbidden from stealing
each other's powers.

But our children aren't.

You're accusing my son?

I haven't seen him
since he was a baby.

He doesn't know me or even know
who he is, because of you.

If your son is the thief,

I will send him to the
depths of Tartarus.

If you touch him, you will
have the fight of your life.

He must return the bolt to me,

in 14 days, by midnight
in the summer solstice.

Or there will be war.

And he's alive.

Percy Jackson is a beast.
You're a beast, man.

How long was it?
Seven minutes.

Seven minutes?
Uh hmmm.

That's crazy, man, that's
ridiculous. How do you do it?

I just like being in the water.

It's the only place
I can think.

I wish I could spend all day in
the water instead of this place.

Right, like high school without the musical.

Every day is the same thing.

Good morning, I'm Ms. Dodds.

The substitute English teacher.

Would someone please
explain what Shakespeare

was trying to convey
in this line from Othello?

Percy Jackson.

Well...

I'm sorry, I don't know.

Anybody else?

Mom, I'm home.
I'm up here, honey.

Hi
Hey, Mom.

How was school today?
The usual.

This dyslexia thing
is getting worse.

Why do you think that?

I don't know, maybe it's the ADHD.

I thought this school was
suppose to make things better.

Percy, I know how hard
this is for you.

But someday, it will
all make sense.

Really?

When?

Tonight? Tomorrow? When?

Woman.

Hi, Gabe.

Where's my beer?

It's in the fridge.

So what, it's suppose to magically
float from the ice box and into my hand.

Oh come on, man.
You could do that right here?

It's disgusting, we're in the kitchen.

Yeah, real charming
you got that.

Show some respect.

That's my mom, right there.

This is my house.

You show some respect.

Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.

He sleeps till noon everyday,
and he can't even hold a job.

Why do you stay with him?

He's been good to us, Percy
in ways you don't understand.

You're right, I don't understand.
I don't get it.

Be prepared, everything
is about to change, Percy.

Everything is about to change ...

There are 12 Olympian gods.

The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.

They attained the power by
overthrowing their father,  Kronos,

chopping him into little pieces.

The three gods have been rivals ever since.

Always arguing, always
threatening war.

On several occasions,
they would come down to Earth

And, uhmm, how shall I put this?

Hook up?

They would hook up with mortals.

The children produced
were half god, half human.

Can anyone what
they were called?

Percy?

I'm sorry, what, Mr. Brunner?

What is the proper name of the
offspring of a human and a god?

Demigod.
Exactly.

Many have been great heroes.
Like Hercules and Achilles.

Can you name another?

I'll give you a hint.

You have something in common.

Percy ... Perseus?

Correct.

Now over here, we have
a depiction of Hercules

defeating the Nemean lion.

Hercules killed the beast
with his bare hands

and he took the skin as trophy.

Percy ...
Yes, Ms. Dodds?

We need to talk.

So did I do something wrong?

Ms. Dodds?

Hello?

Where is it?

How did you get up there?

You stole the lightning bolt!

I don't know what you're talking about!
Give it to me!

Give it to me now!

Percy!

Release him!

You ...

Release him or I swear
I'll tear you to pieces.

I'm going crazy.
I should be on vacation.

Percy, calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.

Oh God, wait.
Did that really just happen?

She's turned to that thing?

A fury.

Concealed in our school,
I should have known.

Wait, wait. A fury? What is a fury?

And why did you say
you could tear her to pieces?

What did she want from you?

She ... said something ...

about me ...

stealing a lightning bolt.

They've found him.

He's in danger.
Who found me?

He's no longer safe here.
 Okay, where should we move him?

We have no choice, the camp.

What camp? Look, I'm standing right here.

If they think he's the thief,

there's nowhere safe from
heaven and earth for him now

Percy.

Take this to defend yourself.
It's a powerful weapon.

Guard it well.
Only use it in times of severe distress.

This is a pen.

This is a pen!

Take him to his mother.
And don't let him out of your sight.

Percy, come on.
Come on, man, come on!

What's going on?

Don't trust anyone, okay.

Don't look at anybody,
just keep walking.

Why did Mr. Brunner
ask you to watch me?

Because I'm your protector.
Wait, hang on.

My protector? Are you kidding?

What? You think because I'm
like this I'm not capable of keeping you safe?

Maybe you're not seeing
what I'm seeing.

You have crutches.

Look, I will give my life
to secure your well-being.

What are you talking about?
What's going on?

We gotta warn your mom.

Come on, Percy. Come on.

Sally! More beer!

Look, we gotta talk, okay.

Can't you see she's servicing
me and my friends?

Hey, hey, don't talk about my mom
like that, you bald-headed freak.

Nice one.
Like I said, I'm your protector.

Sally, Percy has to leave now.
Like right now.

What is happening?

Okay, I swear I didn't steal anything.
Honey, I believe you. I believe you.

Where are you taking me?
What is this camp?

It's a camp for really special
people like you.

Special people, what, am I
crazy or something?

No, honey, no.

Percy, this is about your father.

Your father was unlike
any guy you've ever seen...

he was just dazzling.

Now he's dazzling?

And then you came along
and then it was just perfect.

But he had to leave.

So he did abandon us.

No, honey.
He was forced to. He loved you.

Leaving you, it was probably the
most difficult thing he ever did.

Why did he had to go?

Because he's ...
Sally, watch out!

Percy!
Mom, are you alright?

Grover, are you alright?

Is it me or is it raining cows?

What is that?

Get out! Come on!

Why are you taking your pants off?
What are you doing?

My job.

Whoa, whoa.
You're half doggie?

I'm half goat.

Watch out.
There's glass.

Come on, get out of the
car, that thing's getting closer!

Do you ever need these?
It's just for show.

Follow me!

This way, guys. This way.

Come on! Come on!
Run! Run!

Go, go!

Come on!

We're here.

Grover!

Mom, what are you doing?

This is as far as I can get.

I can't go through,
I'm not like you.

I'm not leaving without you.
You have to!

You have to.

Put my mother down!

Percy, go!
You're safe inside the gate.

What can I do?
Use the pen!

What?
Use Brunner's pen and click it.

Is everything okay?

Percy, behind you!

Percy, are you okay?
I'm not feeling...

Percy!

It hurts.
I'm sure glad you're alive.

Where am I? What is this place?

The infirmary. You've been
unconscious for three days.

Three days?

So, Percy.

What do you remember?

Some crazy dream.

There was a monster.

My mom was there,
you were there too.

You were some weird hybrid
man-goat thing, whoa.

Put it in the correct term, it's satyr.

All of it was real?

My mom was gone?

I'm sorry, Percy.
I tried, man, I really do.

But frankly, I'm just
a junior protector.

I don't have horns yet.

It's my fault.

It was my job to protect you.

Both of you.

So, this is Camp Half-Blood.

What do you mean, what?
I think you know.

Half mean, half mortal, half god.

Fire!
Oh guys, watch the arrows!

Newcomer, hello.

Look, man. Remember all the myths
about great gods and goddesses.

Well, they're not myths.

Remember what Mr. Brunner said.
Sometimes...

they come down to Earth
and they fall in love with mortals.

And they'll have kids.

No way.
Yes way.

Yup, you're a demigod.

Two points for Percy Jackson!

Don't worry, but you're not alone.
There's hundreds in the world.

Some live normal lives.

And some, I'm not allowed to
vulgar names are very famous.

I'm talking about like
White House famous.

See man, this place right here. This is the place
where you learn to harness your powers.

You train to become leaders,
warriors and heroes.

I think you have the wrong guy.

I'm not a hero, I'm a loser.

I have dyslexia and ADHD.

And those are your
greatest gifts.

If you kinda read,
the words float off the page, right?

That's because your brain's hotwired
for ancient Greek and not English.

Right. At the museum I can read.
Yeah.

And your ADHD...

You're impulsive, Percy.
You can't be still!

Those are your natural battle reflexes, man.

They kept you alive
in your fight.

Look, no pitiful loser
can defeat a Minotaur.

Your blood is special.
It's the blood of a god.

That's a lot to process.

A lot. A lot.

This is where you'll do most
of your battle training.

What's her name?

She will squash you like a bug.
Her name?

Annabeth. Daughter of
Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

Hey, no staring.
Keep it moving.

Come on, come on.

There's someone I want
you to see. Check this out.

What are those things?
The centaurs.

Wait, is that Mr. Brunner?
Come on.

Mr. Brunner?

In my world, I'm
known as Chiron.

Are you recovered?
Am I recovered?

You, you're not in a wheelchair.

You have ...
A real horse's ass.

I apologize for hiding
my true form,

but I needed to keep an eye on you.

I hope you'll forgive me. Come.

Grover! Grover, come here!

Daughters of Aphrodite.

Alright, guys. You guys
got a lot of catching up to do.

Their mother is the goddess of love.
Let's see where that leads.

Hey, baby!
Satyrs ...

What is this place?

Welcome home.
His father built this.

For you.

This whole place is mine?

I think it has some weight to it.

My father is Poseidon.
God of the seas.

Why didn't anybody tell me?

It was for your own safety.

It's extremely rare for a child
to be born to one of the big three.

They're very powerful.
A threat.

A threat?
Who am I threatening?

Poseidon's brothers.
Zeus and Hades.

That's why your mother
married your stepfather.

His pungent odor masked
the smell of your blood.

And hid you from
anything or anyone

that gods have sent to kill you.

My mother put up with
that creep to protect me?

I wish I've known...

She sacrificed so much for me.

Now she's gone.

Why am I even here?
You're here because you're in jeopardy.

Everyone thinks you're
the lightning thief.

Look, I didn't steal it.

Zeus' bolt is the most powerful
weapon ever created.

And if it's not returned by
summer solstice

In ten days, there will be a war.
This is your problem, alright, not mine.

This is about your world not mine.

This is about all worlds.

The Olympians would be
forced to choose sides,

Earth would become
a battleground.

Mountains erupting,
earthquakes, raging fires!

The end of life as you know it.

What can we do?

I want to take you to Olympus.
Convince Zeus of your innocence.

Someone's using you
to start a war.

What are we doing here? Let's go now.

Your boldness is commendable,
but outside those gates,

you will be in danger
at all times.

The Fury and the Minotaur
were only the beginning.

First, you must train.

This is always a fun
game to watch.

How do you guys wear these stuff?
It weighs more than me!

Trust me, wear it or you'll get killed.
Wait, what?

Wait.
Heroes!

Warriors! Come on!

Hustle, hassle.

Stop bloody gagging.

Percy, step forward.

This is Percy Jackson.

He's gonna need a team.

We'll take him.

I'm Luke, son of Hermes
and camp leader.

Not necessarily in that order.

Where's your helmet?
No one gave me one.

Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?
He's gonna need it.

You're gone here, man.

I'm messing with you.
Smile a little bit. It's good for you, kid.

Anybody got an extra helmet?
Please pass it up.

Try it on.

That will protect you.
From all of us.

Welcome to the
blue soldiers, my friend.

Alright, everyone in position
for capture the flag.

First team to capture
the enemy's banner wins.

Dismissed.

Ready, steady, now!

Percy I know where
the flag is at, come on!

Keep your eyes open and don't get killed.

I'm coming, buddy.
I'm coming.

Sons of Ares. Watch out!

Well, that's a sword!
That's a sword!

You guys take camp
way too seriously.

Go!

Percy, get out here!
Go look for the flag.

How did I just do that?

I won.

Do you really think it
would be that easy?

My mother is goddess of
wisdom and battle strategy.

Do you know what that means?
I always win.

I always lose.
Maybe we're both wrong.

Hey Chiron, shouldn't we
get there and stop it.

Coz she's killing him, man.
You gotta be kidding.

This is the best part.

God!
Stand up and fight.

Hero.

Come on, Percy.

Go to the water.

The water will give you power.

Excuse me. Excuse me!

Ladies and gentlemen, the son
of Poseidon is coming through!

A hero is coming through! Move it!

Hey, no dirty look. Stop that.

Hey, Percy?

We're having a party
at our place later

and we would really
love it if you came.

I would love to come,
that'll be great.

That will be amazing!
Really grand.

I would love to come too,
to the party, you know.

Thanks for inviting me, ladies.

Beat it, nymphs.

Wait, don't leave, ladies.
I'm available.

Hey, come on, don't leave.
I'm available! What time's the party?

Feeling like a hero?

More like a mutant.

I'm not gonna grow a fish tail
or gills or anything like that, am I?

Not likely.

Although a huge ego is
not out of question.

You know, you could've
killed me out there.

I could've died if
I was normal.

But you aren't.

I get a sense that
you don't like me very much.

It's possible.

I mean, our parents
hate each other.

Wait, they do?

I definitely have strong
feelings for you.

I just haven't decided if
they're positive or negative.

Well, you let me know
when you figured it out.

You'll be the first.

Percy Jackson show me yourself!

Hades, stay back!

Percy Jackson, bring
me the bolt.

Be a good boy, hand it to me,

and I will exchange it for your mother.

Percy, listen, Percy!

My mother is gone!

No, your mother is still alive.

I sent the minotaur
to abduct her.

She's here with me
in the Underworld.

Mom?

Percy.

What have you done with my mother?

If you ever want to see your mother
again, you will bring me the bolt.

Chiron, I have to go get her.

Percy, you don't
have the bolt.

I'm gonna tell him the truth.

When he realizes, I'm not the thief.

He'll release her.
No.

You cannot negotiate with Hades.

When he finds out you
don't have the bolt

he will kill you and your mother.

But this is our only chance.

No, stick to our plan.

Come to Olympus.

Bargain with Zeus.

Once you convince
him of your innocence,

we will do everything in our
power to bring back your mother.

Okay.

Going somewhere?

Yeah, I'll be going for a walk.

For a walk?
I'm coming with you.

No, I'm going alone.

No, I'm coming with you.
No.

You're being followed.

Leave me alone.
Go to sleep or something.

No.

One small victory and you're
ready to fight Hades?

Double team.
Really? You too?

Look, I just found out my mother is
still alive, I'm gonna get her back.

From the Underworld?
Whatever it takes.

Yeah, well maybe you'll outsmart Hades.

Maybe I will.

I can't let you do this, okay?

I'm not asking for your permission.

Okay.

Well, according to the regulations,
if I can't stop you

I must accompany you, coz
I'm your best friend.

And your protector.
Junior protector.

Was that really necessary?

I don't need your help, okay.
This is something I have to do on my own.

Yeah well, we weren't
asking for you permission.

Come on.

Today you tried to kill me.
Now you wanna defend me?

It wasn't real.

That was just training.

Percy, that's all I've ever done
is train and train.

I've grown up here, I've only
been in the outside world

a couple of times.

And I've never had a chance
to go in an actual quest.

Beside, you won one battle,

and I've won hundreds.

You're gonna need my experience.

Good point.

You two really wanna come.

Yeah.
Yes.

Okay. I guess we're all going.

So, who knows how to
get to the Underworld?

I did not think of that one.

I think I know someone
who might.

Luke?

Hey, guys.

Percy. I'm thinking that you'd
stop by sooner or later.

Everybody does.

Getting away from all
that Renaissance Fair...

stuff out there, you know.

But ...

Welcome to the modern world.

Cool stuff.

What are you guys up to?

We're going to get my mom back.

You're dad is the messenger of the gods.

One of the only ones who's gotten
in and out of the Underworld.

Do you have any idea how?

My dad's a jerk,
I've never met him.

You too?

Guess we all got
daddy issues, huh?

That's because all gods are the same.

Selfish, they only care
about themselves.

But I once broke into
my dad's house.

Got some cool stuff.

For you.

Flying shoes?

My dad's.

He has hundreds of these little guys.

I won't even miss him.

You're gonna need the other one.

People have gone to the Underworld
before without having to be dead.

Hercules did it, Morpheus did it,
my dad does it all the time.

Getting in is the easy part.

Getting out, well, that's tricky.

This is a map to Persephone's pearls.

Persephone?

You mean Hades' wife?

Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
He keeps her prisoner.

Needless to say she hates it there.

It's hot, he's a weirdo.

So she has secret visitors.

She keeps pearls and
put them all over the world.

These pearls, they provide a
quick escape from the Underworld.

You could use them to get out.

So how do the pearls work?

Easy.

You take a pearl, step
on it, you crush it,

and visualize where
you wanna be taken.

Right now, there's three pearls
in the United States.

This map will guide you there.

Right here is your first location.

Auntie Em's Garden Emporium.

Once you find the first pearl,
the map will show you the next one,

and the next one, and then
you're off to Hades.

Which reminds me, you guys
might need some extra protection.

My favorite shield.

You might wanna take a step back.

Thanks, Luke.
Don't mention it.

But ...

You're gonna have to promise
me one thing.

If you see my dad
on the highway to hell

Yeah.
Kick his ass for me.

This place definitely needs
an extreme makeover.

Hello?

Hello, anybody home in Auntieville?

Check this out,
they got free sodas.

Okay, that's nasty.

The health department
needs to give this place an "F".

Hey guys, check this out.

Look at this.

Gold Drachmas.

It means we're on the right track.

Here.

How are we gonna find
the pearl in this place?

That's a good question.

Okay, let's split up.

Check everything.
Good idea.

I'll go this way.

Auntie Em?

She's coming!
What? Who?

We stopped to get directions,
my poor husband.

Help me! Please help me!

Check this out. He's just
like my Uncle Ferdinand.

That's crazy.

He got the mole in the same place.

But that's not my Uncle Ferdinand,
coz my Uncle Ferdinand was killed by...

Medusa!

We're in trouble!
Grover?

We have to leave
before she finds us.
Who?

She turned my husband to stone.

Grover, where are you?

Percy! Annabeth!

Annabeth, where are you?
Grover.

Come on, man.
Watch where you're going!

Where are we?
We're in Medusa's lair.

Don't move!

Well, this is a fabulous surprise.

It's so heartening to have
such young visitors.

We get so lonely here.

Don't we?

That's why I created my statues.

They're my only company.

Daughter of Athena.
How do you know me?

You have such beautiful hair.

I once had hair like that.

I was courted, desired by many suitors.

But that all changed
because of your mother.

The woman who cursed me.

Who turned me...

Don't look!
into this.

They say the eyes are
windows to the soul.

I hope you find my eyes...

attractive.

It's so rude not looking
people in the eye.

Come on.

Sneak a peek.

How are we gonna fight
something we can't look at?

We can look at her reflection.

Check this out.
Good idea.

I'll go get Annabeth.
Okay, I will take care of Medusa.

You'll make a wonderful
addition to my collection.

We'll be friends forever.

Do you mind?

Sooner or later,
you will open those eyes.

The temptation to look
at me is too hard to resist!

Don't look, Annabeth,
don't open your eyes!

Who's that? Another demigod?

I can sense you.

Son of Poseidon.

I used to date your daddy.

Need a hand?

Thanks.
Come on. Let's go.

I heard you have the lightning bolt.
May I see it?

I don't have it.

Let me see your eyes.

I heard their bluer
that the seclusian sea

Open them!

Or my hungry babies
will have to open them for you.

Well, it will be such pity to destroy

such young and handsome face.

Stay with me, Percy.

All you have to do is look!

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

Son of Poseidon ...

Piss off.

Guys, it's cool to open up your eyes.

Annabeth, that was great,
great demigod driving.

We could take it with us.
The head? No, that's sick.

You open the eyes,
they still work.

Dead or alive.

You'll never know when
something like that may come in handy.

Yeah, you're right
but I'm not touching it.

Come on, man.
Just take off your jacket.

We'll wrap it up
until we get some ice.

Why do I have to take off my jacket?

Because you're the protector.

Yeah, I'm the protector.

So I'm giving my hoody,
and not my jacket, okay?

It's disgusting.
Just toss it up.

Hey, guys, wait.

One down. Two to go.

It would've been nice if Luke
had warned us about Medusa.

Maybe he just didn't know.

GPS from the gods. Where to next?

Let's see.

Parthenon in Nashville.

Nashville? Great.

Home of my least favorite music.

Let's not do that again.
Let's stop right about now.

Good idea.
Oh my God.

Nice work today.

Thanks.

What happened to you?

That poor lady who turned
to stone, she ...

she have a tight grip.

Check this out.

Cool.

That was very cool.

So...

Why do our parents hate each other?

They both wanted to
be patron god of Athens.

And...

The people chose Athena.

And our parents have
hated each other ever since.

What's your mom like?
I don't know.

I never met her.
What? Is it...

like this for everybody?

Don't any god
see their kids?

It's forbidden.

Right after we're born, Zeus
decreed that the gods

could not have physical contact
with their mortal offspring.

Well, that's just a stupid law.

I agree.

Although ...

Between us ...

I think my mother speaks
to me sometimes.

In times of trouble, I hear
her voice giving me advice.

That's happened to me.

Yeah, that's your father
talking to you.

Hey yo, Percy!

Get in here, man. This is ugly.

Right.

Hey hurry up!

Percy. Check this out, man.

You're on TV.

Regarding the missing boy,
Percy Jackson

and his mother, Sally Ugliano.

But their relatives have
some interesting theories.

So, Mr. Ugliano talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.

He's not my son.
He's stepson.

He did not come from this loins.

Ever since he started
with the drugs and the alcohol...

Oh no.

Five nights ago, he tried to kill me
and he threw his mother on the ground

And his friend crippled friend then
attacked me from behind and knocked me out.

When I woke up, Sally was gone.

She was kidnapped by Percy.
... She would never

Shut up, Gabe.

Great. Now, I'm a fugitive.

See? That's what I'm talking about man.

Gabe's always running his mouth.

He's mad because I blasted
him up with my crutches.

Guys.

I can't pee with
her watching me.

Sorry, guys. I messed up.

Should have closed the curtains.

Come on, guys.

Let's hit the road before
Homeland Security shows up.

That's amazing.

A complete replica of the
Parthenon in Nashville.

Alright, guys.
Let's go get the pearl.

It's your mother.

I wonder if she really looks like that.

We'll find out.

Guys, check this out.

It's the pearl.

That was easy.

Easy?

It's 30 feet or meter and this
place is filled with tourists.

I got an idea.

We'll come back after this place closes.
Come on, follow me.

Or I could just throw my crutches up
there, see if the pearl will fall off.

Percy I'm saying, it's not a bad idea.

The park's been closed
for an hour.

Let's move.

Let's hurry.

It's a little bit crazy.

I'm gonna fly up using Luke's
flying shoes and I'll grab the pearl.

Cool.

So, what are we gonna do?

Alright, guys.

I got this.
Got what?

You'll kill the checkers?
Chill.

Those are working cost Americans.

Why did you do that?
They're not dead.

They're unconscious
for only 30 minutes. Come on!

Cool.

Yo, what's cracking?

Hey.

Luke!

Annabeth!
How do you turn on the shoes?

Tell Percy he's gonna break
into a run, okay.

He's gonna draw up speed
kinda like a jet on a runway.

It's gonna take some practice.

Okay.

I got this.

It's gonna take some practice!

I got it!
Yes!

Yeah, Percy!
There we go.

There it is!

That's what I'm talking about.
There we go.

Alright, let's grab everything.
Let's go.

Aw, man ...

I got this, okay.

Hey guys, I'm with
Park Recreational Services

you guys have been caught sleeping on the job.

You better be happy I'm not
writing you guys up, okay. It's the last time.

We were expecting you, Mr.
Jackson.

Give us the lightning
bolt and we'll let you go.

I don't have the lightning bolt.

Okay. This is bad.

Hydra!

Guys, watch out, because
that one will spit us fire!

You got a sweet tooth.

Alright.

Percy, stop!

No!

How could I've been awesome with that!
I just killed that thing!

Killed it? You only made it worse.
What are you talking about?

Percy, when you cut off one hydra
head, two more grow back.

Run.

Distract that thing.
I'll get the pearl.

Go.

Open the door!
The door won't open!

Grover!

That's nasty.

We cut our regularly scheduled
programming with this special report.

Scientists are baffled by what
now appears to be single

storm cloud that is expanding
over the rest of Europe and Asia

moving towards the United States.

Savage winds, rains and
manic waves are being reported

along the coastlines of
several continents.

So far, no casualties, but countries
everywhere are preparing for the worst.

The gods are angry.

We need to get the last pearl.
Where's the next location?

Yeah. Let us see...

Well guys. We got ourselves a good one.

We're going to Vegas!

There it is.

Lotus Casino.

I've been looking forward to this.

Look guys, remember, always
put the 8's and never the 10's, okay.

We're not here to gamble, remember?

They got poker, they got black jack.
Grover.

We're not here to have fun.
We just need to grab the pearl and go, okay.

This is nice.

This place is officially gold.

Here is your complimentary
Lotus fun book.

Thanks, but we're not staying.

Please, I insist.
It's good for everything in the Hotel and Casino.

Don't come to us.
We're not checking in.

That guy was persistent.
Yeah.

But we're here for one thing
and one thing only.

That is really awesome.

Where would we find a green
pearl in this place?

Maybe I'll cap a waitress or a showgirl.
We should start there.

Can I get you something?

Try a Lotus flower. They're so good.
It's our signature dish.

Really? Signature? Is it good?

Thank you.

Don't we have to pay for this?

I guess we don't.
It's free.

This is really good.

This is the most delicious
thing I've ever consumed!

Why don't we stay here for a while?

That sounds like an amazing idea.

But we're on a time sensitive
mission right now.

Aren't we?

I can't remember.

I totally forgot what
I was gonna say.

I think I figured it out.
I think I know why we're here.

Why are we here?

To have fun!

Okay. Let's never leave.
Let's stay here!

Awesome!

No, Percy, don't
eat the flower.

It dulls the senses.
It keeps you prisoner here.

Hey, I'll get some air.
I'll be right back.

Another Lotus flower?
No, I'm good, thank you.

Look around you. Focus.

Lotus flower?
No, thank you.

Would you like another one?
I'm fine.

"The French Connection"?
Yeah, you've seen it yet?

Yeah, I think so, on DVD.

What's DVD?

Seriously?

I think it's the best
movie of the year.

What? Wait, this year?

This year. 1971.

Percy, wake up.

You need to escape. Wake up!

You can really use a Lotus flower.

I really don't want that.
Thank you.

Just one.
No.

Another Lotus flower?

No.
We insist.

I really don't want another Lotus flower.
So please leave me alone.

Is there a problem, Mr. Jackson?

No, thank you.

Percy Jackson is awake.

Excuse me.

What are you doing with that?
Don't eat that.

What?
We have to go now.

What do you mean? We're having so much fun.
No, we're not having fun.

Grover, wake up!

Grover, come one, we gotta go!

Not now, Percy, your timing
is terrible, okay.

Dude, we're heading to the chapel.
We're getting married.

How romantic!
No, no, no ...

Which one of you is going with me?

Wake up!

Yo man, you're such a bust kill!

Percy, what's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?

Both of you need to wake up now!

Look at me, you're in a trance, okay.
We're trapped!

Listen to me, if you eat the flowers,
you'll never gonna leave.

We're gonna be stuck here forever!

Oh, no! We gotta go!

Guys, we gotta go!

Stop right there.

Out of the way.

Come on.

Come on, guys. The car!

Come on, come on. In the car.
Let's go. Keys.

I got the keys.
Go, go!

Incoming. Incoming.

I got this.
Go!

That's how you get out of a casino.
That's how you drive.

Of course. Now that all makes sense.
What?

That was the lair of the
"lotus-eaters."

They've been luring people into
their traps since ancient times.

Guys, look.
Tomorrow is June 21st.

No, it can't be. Today is the 15th.

No. Tomorrow is 21st. We were
in there for five days.

Felt like an hour.
Tomorrow is the solstice.

Our deadline is tomorrow
at midnight.

Okay, look we gotta move.
Where's Hades?

He's in Hollywood.
Alright.

I get there in four hours.
Maybe three.

And now the latest breaking news KZO1.

An unprecedented storm cloud

is swelling to cover most
of North America.

Authorities in several states
are ordering evacuations

and reporting severe
weather conditions.

Watch your step.

Wait.

Woe to all depraved souls.

There's no turning back now.
Yes.

As if we're stuck in here.

Percy, who's that creepy
guy with the hood?

I don't know. Let's find out.

Who are you?
We need to see Hades.

The living are not permitted here.
Die and come back.

Okay, we won't die
and come back...

You know what?

We gotta pay the ferry.

Yo, my friend. What up?

Okay, that's not like it.
You like dead, alright?

I got here two dead people
you might recognize.

Check this out: Jackson, Grant and
look who's joining the party.

Benjamin Franklin.
Yeah, you like that, aren't you?

You give us a boat ride, you take the money
and you get an interior decorator

coz it's too depressing in here, alright.

Here you go.

That's a $170.
Wait.

The Drachmas.

Come aboard.

Thanks for telling me, man.
You're burning money, we're in recession.

This is treason.
Shut up.

Welcome to the Underworld.

What is all this?

It's graphic of human misery.

Lost hopes and dreams.

Wishes that never
came true.

All lives end in
suffering and tragedy.

This is as far as I go.

Guys, do you hear that?

Yes, what is that?
I don't know.

What are we gonna do?

Who are those things?
Hellhounds.

Yeah, ,maybe you should feed them.

They sense the presence
of another animal.

Great, I smell goat.
You're a satyr.

I haven't had a satyr...

visit before.

Persephone!
What would cause you to be taking so long?

Don't ignore me.
Or what?

What will you do? I'm already in hell.

We have visitors.

Well, that's you.

Welcome.

You have your
father's looks.

Always the lucky
side of the family.

Wait. You're Hades?
Yes.

I'm sorry, I just didn't expect
you to look like this, man.

That was stylish, I like it.

Would you prefer that I look like...this?

No! Let's stick with
the Mick Jagger thing.

It works for you.

You're very brave coming here.

Come closer.

I can see a look of
disgust in your eyes.

You see, disgust is
not righteous.

I was banished here
by Zeus and his father.

I'm done. My only chance
of getting out of this place...

is defeat my brother and take
control of Olympus.

Of course ... I need the bolt.

And I need my mother.

So we have an understanding.

You give me the bolt and
I'll give you your mother.

I need to tell you the truth.
I'm not the lightning thief.

I don't have the bolt.

I never did.

Why did you come here then?

Well, I was hoping that...

when you saw that I wasn't the thief,
you'll let my mother go.

Do you think I'm an idiot?

I am Hades! Now give me the bolt
or say goodbye to your mother!

Percy!

I thought I lost you forever.

No.

Zeus' master bolt.

Liar.

I swear.

I don't know how that got
into this, it's not even my shield.

No, Luke rigged it.

He put the bolt in your
shield and used us.

Luke stole the lightning bolt.

I think we're done here.

Feed them to the souls.

We had a deal, right?

You have the bolt,
just let us go.

Summon the hounds.

Sit, sit.

I...

...am going to be king of the gods.

Stay back!

Stay!

Alright, come on.

Come on, give it back.

Bad dog!

He won't remember a thing.

Why did you do that?

Because...

he's cruel and abusive.

The only thing I look forward to

is my allotted time
away from this hell hole.

A war of the gods will put an end to that.

And I'd be alone

with only him forever.

Go.

Take the bolt and your mother.

Only three?

No.

There are four of you.

Each pearl transports
only a single person.

One of you will have to stay.

Alright, I'll stay.

You three go.
What?

No.
No, no, no. I've achieved my quest.

I'm staying here.
I've trained for situations like this.

Guys, guys, knock it off.

I'm staying because I'm your protector.
Grover, come on.

Look, man, I don't need to hear it.
Just go. It's my duty.

It's my memoir.

We'll come back for you.

I will take very good care of you.

All right. Now move it, guys.

You need to be stepping on the pearl and
concentrating on where you wanna go.

Take this.

To Olympus.

Hey, look.

Zeus and Poseidon are
preparing for battle.

No, this isn't the right place.
This isn't Olympus.

This is the Empire State Building.

Percy, the entrance to
the Olympus is there.

Well, it's ten minutes till
midnight, let's move.

Percy Jackson.

You weren't supposed to
make it out alive.

I can't let you take that
bolt to Olympus.

I'm the lightning thief.

You hid the bolt in my shield.
Why?

Well, when you said you were
going to the Underworld, it hit me.

That is the perfect opportunity
to get the bolt to Hades.

Why would you do that?

To bring Olympus
crumbling down.

Percy, let's go.

Let's go.

Well, it's too late. Because I'm
returning the bolt to Zeus, right now.

Not before midnight.

Are you alright?
Yeah.

Luke, why do you want
a war of the gods?

Control.

They've been in power for too long.

I say it's time for our
generation to take over.

Remold the world in our image.

A world of new heroes.
You're no hero.

Annabeth, are you alright?
Yeah

Stay here.

Maybe they were wrong.

Maybe you're no
son of Poseidon.

I think I am the
son of Poseidon.

He got the bolt.
Come on! We got two minutes.

Olympus.

Percy, I can't get through.
You gotta go.

Silence!

It's almost midnight.

This was predestined.
You wanted to get this badly.

You have only yourself to blame!

Please!

Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!

Time has run out.
Wait!

Wait! Wait!

My name is Percy Jackson and...

I think you might be looking for this.

Give me the bolt, lightning thief.

You are wise to
betray your father.

I didn't steal it. But I have
no connection to Poseidon.

So tell me. If you didn't
steal it, then who did?

Luke, son of Hermes.

You see, he was angry with you.

All of you.

He wanted you to
destroy yourselves.

You have done well.

Let there be peace!

Hi, Mom.
Annabeth.

I'm so proud of you.

Zeus.

I have a good friend.
He is a satyr named Grover.

He's my protector and...

the only reason why escaped the
Underworld is because he stayed behind.

And now you expect
me to bring him back.

Very well.

I believe this assembly's
business here is finished.

Brother, please.

I need to speak with him.

Just this once.

I'll meet you outside.

I'm not expecting you
to forgive me.

But I want you to
know that I'm grateful.

I didn't do it for you.

I did it to save mom.

Please.

I don't have much time.

How old was I when you left?

Seven months.

Look I didn't need
you there all the time.

I would've like to have
seen you just once.

Why didn't you ever come back?

I wanted to.

When I was with you
and your mother

I became less concerned
with my responsibilities.

I was becoming human.

And that's a bad thing?
To a god? Zeus thinks.

That's why he pass the law
preventing gods from...

ever having contact
with their children.

Only because of you?

But I was always with you.

Just because you didn't see me,
doesn't mean that I wasn't there.

When you're in trouble,
I tried to help.

I heard you.

I know I'm not the father
you've always wanted.

But if you'll ever need me,
I will be there for you.

In your thoughts.
And in your dreams.

I will stand by you, Percy.
Always.

You can come visit me. Anytime.

Just promise me that I don't have
to see that loser Gabe ever again.

I kicked him out. Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.

Finally.

I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.

Percy?

This is where you belong.

Percy, watch out!

You guys gonna kill the man
who saved the world? Great job!

All you guys take a
lunch break. Thank you.

So, the conquering hero
returns triumphant.

Grover.
Have you noticed anything
different about me?

No.

Are you sure?
Anything that's improved about me?

No, what? You've been working out?
You got a new cologne? You smell good.

Look, man. I got my horns!

I should've seen it the whole time.
Hey, look at that thing.

You got little horns in your head.
It's crazy.

Zeus came through.

I'm now a senior protector,
first class, baby.

Congratulations. Definitely, you're one.
Thank you, man.

Keep moving. Keep moving.
Don't lose interest.

One foot in front of the other and the
next thing you know you're running.

Percy.

You left the camp, and
disobeyed my orders.

Yeah, about that ...
Which is why ...

you're my favorite student.

You can receive all the training
in the world but ultimately

you have to follow your instincts.

Grace under pressure.

Alright. I'm trying to train.
Go suit up.

You might be a big shot on
Olympus, but down here

you're still just one of my students.

Move it.

Nice horns, Grover.

It's crazy. We talked.
We dined. We had a great time.

I'm happy for you, you know.

Persephone might really like me.
I'm serious.

You can handle this
one on your own, man.

Alright, Percy.

Good job, Percy.
Thank you.

Who's next?

I think I'd like to give it a shot.

Welcome home.

Whoa, whoa, wait!

First rule of battle strategy:

Don't ever let your
opponent distract you.
