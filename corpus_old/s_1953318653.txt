Timmy! Bedtime! Lights off!

Aaah!
No problem, mom!

Goodnight, hon.

<i>He's gaining on us.</i>

<i>Yikes! What are
we gonna do?</i>

<i>Blind Wonder,
do you see that?</i>

<i>Yeah, we got to save him
from that creature.</i>

<i>I'll distract it
and you grab it.</i>

Timothy, did you hear me?

Timothy! Answer me!

The start of summer
vacation doesn't save
you from your chores.

Did you hear me?

I'll do it when this is over.
No! You'll do it now.

But, dad!
I don't want to hear it!

If you want allowance
to buy comic books and
play those Atari games,

Then you're gonna have to
work outside and around
the house, all right?

Randy, why don't you
lay off the boy?

Summer vacation just started.

Damn it, dad.
Don't question me.

We both agreed that
if you were going to
live here with us, that...

Pss, pss, pss, pss.
That show.
I'm trying to watch it.

Okay. Finish watching
your show, but make
sure it gets done.

Thanks, grandpa.

Oh, yeah,
no problem.

<i>Hey, mud butt!
Huh?</i>

<i>Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?</i>

Timmy, come over here
and sit with me.

<i>Yeah, Blind Wonder!
Yeah, Blind Wonder!</i>

Can I ask you
a question?

Sure.

What are you boys gonna
do with that underground
clubhouse you're building?

Don't worry, I'm not
gonna say anything.

How'd you know?

Well, I was taking a walk
around where you boys play,

Like my doctor says
I have to,

And I saw this
underground stovepipe.

I started poking
around and found
a leather strap, I pulled it,

And low and behold, there was
an underground hideout.

Oh, man. We thought
nobody knew about it.

Nobody does. Just me.
I'm not gonna say anything.

Matter of fact, I left you
a present down there.

What is it?

No. It's a surprise,
but you'll find it.

Thanks, grandpa!
That's awesome.

Hey!

Why are you
so out of breath?

Look at my pants.

It was that stray dog again.

He almost got me,
but I lost him
back at the cemetery.

Wow, the dog did that?

Yeah, it started
chasing me. Got my leg,
but I kicked him off.

Is that the map?
Yeah.

Worked on it all night.
You gotta see it!

Well, take it out.

At the dugout.
Let's get Barry
and look at it there.

I'm supposed to
finish this. My dad's
already in a bad mood.

You go ahead.
I'll finish up here.
I need the exercise anyway.

Really?

Sure. Go on.

You boys have a good time.

Thanks, grandpa!
Race ya.

Good morning, boys.
Hi, Mrs. Smeltzer.

Who is it?
It's...

Rhonda, who is it?

What the hell
do you two want?

Banging on people's door this
early in the morning. What
the hell's wrong with you?

Sorry. We were just
looking for Barry.

Well, Barry is over
at the cemetery, working,

Which you two
should be doing.

You got jobs
for this summer?

We just wanted
to show Barry something.

Well, what is it?

It's a drawing.
I made it.

It's a drawing. I made it.

Drawing's for fags.
Are you a queer or somethin'?
No wonder your old man took off.

Clark! Don't say
such things to that boy!

Rhonda. Shut up and
get back in the kitchen!

Let's go.

And where the hell
do you think you're going?

What, are you deaf
and stupid, boy?

If we're so stupid,

Then how come Barry's out
doing your job,

While you're still sleeping
off last night's bottle?

What the hell
did you just say to me, boy?

You heard me. Go ahead.
Touch me.

You lay one hand on me and
everyone will know about you.

Go ahead. Tell everybody.
'cause there ain't nothing
to tell, you little bastard.

Come on, Timmy.

And I don't want to see
the two of you playing

In the cemetery any more,
you hear me?

Why do you have to
talk to them that way?

There's no need
to talk to them that way.

Did you just question me?

Sorry for what he said
about your old man.

I don't care about that.
I know my dad loves me.

When he comes
back from California,
everyone will see.

It grabbed my pant leg
with its jaws and
it was about to rip my pants,

But thank God I kicked it off
'cause it almost made this
rope here snap in half.

Nice one! That looked
like a triple header.

I'm telling you.
It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

It's all in the wrist.

Hey, there, Timmy.

Hey. You guys
catch anything yet?

Nothing but weeds
and a spare tire.

Hold this. Let me
show you guys something.

Whoa! That was cool!

What can I say.
I'm a natural.
It's all in the wrist.

See? I told you.
It's all in the wrist.

I know,
but we gotta go.

Okay.

See you guys later. I hope
you catch something big.

I already have.

She's beautiful.
Totally.

Who knows? Maybe we'll
add a new member to
the dugout this summer.

What?

I don't know.

What is it?

Not sure.
Never mind. Let's go.

Hey, guys.
How did you know I was here?

Your dad told us.
Oh.

Yeah. He was
pretty angry.

He sleeps in.
Been workin'
a lot of nights, lately.

So what happened?

My dad thinks it was
Ronny's gang that did it.

You know,
busting up the dead heads.

Trying to start up
rumors about the old mine
and the ghoul.

Was your dad
drinking last night?

I guess so. I don't know.

Why does
he drink so much?

My mom says
he's been that way
ever since the accident.

Is that watch new?

Yeah. My old man
gave it to me
for my birthday.

About the only thing
he's ever given me.

That, and a few
fresh ones.

He was acting
kind of weird though.

Said we shouldn't be playing
around here no more.

Sounds like him. This morning,
before he went to bed,
he called reverend Moore.

Got permission to get
some signs made up.
No trespassing.

But, it's daytime.

The way it sounded,
he didn't even
want me here, except to work.

No bike riding. No exploring.
No nothing.

Where else are we supposed
to hang out? The playground?

Plus, we got
the dugout right here.
We can't just abandon it.

If we're in the dugout,
no one can see us anyway.

My dad'll never
even know we're here.

Then it's settled?
Yep.

We stay.

What's this?
It has your name on it.

Oh, wow! I almost forgot.

My grandpa.
He told me earlier that he
left me a surprise.

In here?

Yeah. He found this place
on one of his walks.

Don't worry, though.
He's cool with everything.

Even the magazines!

Nice.

You're not
gonna open it?

Nah, maybe later.
Let's check out
the map, first.

Wow!
You guys like it?

It looks great.

It's amazing.

You even added
Ronny's forts.

The one's that
we know about, at least.

Hey. We can use this to
plan escape routes and stuff,

Before we raid them.

Timmy!

You guys hear that?
What?

Timmy!

Timmy? Where are you, Timmy?

Oh, man.
That's my mom.

What do you
think she wants?

Where are you?
Honey, where are you?

Timmy, where are you?

I'm here, mom.

Timmy, where have
you been?

We've been looking
all over for you!

I was just...
Wait, what happened?

It's your grandpa.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, baby.

<i>I lift up my eyes
to the mountains.</i>

<i>Where does my help
come from?</i>

<i>My help comes from the lord,
maker of heaven and earth.</i>

<i>He will not let
your foot slip,</i>

<i>He who watches over you
will not slumber.</i>

<i>Indeed he who watches
over Israel will neither
slumber nor sleep.</i>

The Lord watches over you,

The Lord is your shade
at your right hand.

The sun
will not harm you by day,
nor the moon by night.

The Lord will
keep you from all harm.

He will watch over your life.

The Lord will watch
over your coming and going

Both now and forever more.

I hear what
you're saying, Steve, but it
doesn't make any sense.

Look at this place.
Where would it be?

I know what I saw, Ronny.
I'm telling you.
It's gotta be here.

Even if that's true,
this place is big.

Yeah, their hideout
could be anywhere.

Well, what do
you wanna do?

It's what
you're gonna do.

Keep an eye out
for those little punks.

Don't let them
get away again. You get me?

I got you.

No screwing around now.
Let's get this done quick.

Your mother's got
supper waiting on us.

Yes, sir.

What is it?

Never mind.
Just get back to work.

I said
get back to work, boy!

Timmy!

Okay, mom!

What's wrong?

This place gives me
the creeps.

You're not a coward,
are you?

No, I just...

I don't see why we can't
do it back at my place.

'cause we do it
at your place
all the time.

I want something a little
bit more adventurous.

What would your father do
if he caught us here?

He'd be writing
both our eulogies.

But, you have nothing
to worry about.

Look, do you
love me or not?

You know I do.

Well, then
shut up and show me.

What's wrong?
Someone's watching us.

Where?

Out there.

Oh!

Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

Yeah.

What if
that was your father?
I'd be a dead man.

Uh, yeah.
He wouldn't kill you.
Maybe castration.

Oh. Sure. That's fine, then.

Hey, there, sweetie.
How you doing?

Okay, I guess.

You know, your grandpa
loved you so much,

And he would want
you to know that

He's in
a better place now.

We should be grateful

That we had him
for as long as we did.

You know,
I spoke to your father,

And he said that
you can do whatever
you want to tomorrow.

No chores, okay?

Okay?

Okay.

Turn out the light
when you're finished,
all right?

Help me! Help me!

Come on! Help me!

Help me! Help me!

Calm down.
My old man will hear you.

Get me
out of here!

How much did
you eat for breakfast?

It's not funny, guys.
Do something!

This isn't
a joke, guys!

Take my hand.

I can't!
I'm holding myself up!

On the count of three.

Okay.

One, two, three.

Are you okay?

No, I'm not okay.

Look at my foot!
Does it look okay?

I'm bleeding!

You just walked
into a hole, that's all.
Didn't you see it?

There wasn't a hole.
The ground just caved in.

Like it was
a trap or something.

Ugh! It smells down there.

I can feel a breeze, too.
It's weird.

Check it out, Barry.

You think maybe
a groundhog did this?

It wasn't
a groundhog, doofus.
It's just another sinkhole.

They're all over
the cemetery.

My dad says the ground
is weaker at certain points

It doesn't
smell like a tunnel.
Smells like a sewer.

We're in a cemetery, guys.
It's probably just someone's
body, rotting away and stuff.

What about my foot?

My dad keeps a kit
in the tractor. I'll get it.

Guys! Look out!

Take that, stupid dog!
Dumb son of a bitch!

Barry! Stop!

What's your problem?
We're safe, now. It's over.

What's gotten
into you, man?

I don't know.

Ah! Oh!

What's wrong?
My watch.

Did you break it?
No. I lost it.

This sucks! My old man
will have a cow if he
finds out I lost that watch.

Where do
you think it is?

Looks like my
old man's done for the day.
Come on, let's go.

Let's get this over with.
My foot's hurting.

Ow!

Does anyone see it?

Oh!

What's wrong?

The floor.
It moved!

Say what?

Here, help me out
with this.

Watch out
for snakes.

Whew. Which one
of you farted?

I thought maybe
a possum crawled up
your butt and died.

Eat my shorts!

Smells gross.

It's probably a rat
or a groundhog or something.

What the heck?
Did your dad do this?

No way. He'd be pissed
as hell if he saw this.

It stinks. That's where
the smell is coming
from, all right?

Just like that
other hole I fell into.

Hey! Maybe it leads
to the mines.

With a whole
series of tunnels!

It could be.

It's gotta be.
No animal would've dug this,

And like you said,
your dad wouldn't
have either.

We've got to explore it.

Make it ours before
anyone else finds it.

We can't do anything now.
It's almost dinner time.

And we still haven't
found my watch.

Why don't
we come back tonight when
our parents are asleep?

It's gonna rain tonight.
Heavy thunderstorms
until morning.

Then we come back
tomorrow night.

It sounds like a plan.

Let's get this hole
covered up.

I'm glad to see you
like the food so much, Doug.

Would you
like some more?

Oh, yes, Mrs. Graco.
This is delicious.
Thank you, again.

Well, I could write
the recipe down for your mom
if you'd like.

How is she
doing, anyway?

She's okay.

Dad? Somebody wrote
"Beware The Ghoul"

On one of the stones
at the cemetery.

Barry said it had
something to do with
the old mines. That true?

Well, the ghoul's
been around forever.

Kind of like Bigfoot or
the Loch Ness Monster.

Loch Ness Monster?

Yeah. It's kind of
like Godzilla, but it
lives underwater.

Anytime anybody skips town,
or somebody's dog
goes missing,

They blame it on the ghoul.

Parents use it as a way
to keep their kids in line.

But the story with the mines,
what does it have
to do with the ghoul?

Some of the survivors said
they saw something down there,

Right before the accident.

Just a bunch
of rumors, though.

Barry's daddy used to work
in the mines. Do you think
he saw the ghoul?

Barry's dad?
No, son.

The only ghoul that
man sees is in that bottle
he drinks every night.

Now, finish up.

It's gonna rain like crazy.

The weatherman
called for it.

Maybe we should
do this another night.

You getting scared,
little baby?

We finally get a chance
to get even with those clowns

And you want to call it off
because of rain?

Give me a break.

Look, you wouldn't
even know about this
if it wasn't for me!

Yeah. Quit
your complaining.

Smeltzer's old man
is really letting this place
fall apart.

The stones are
practically falling over.

Barry's dad's a drunk.
Everybody knows it.

He's a loser,
just like his son.

Yeah, it's right
up here.

Wait till you see
the size of this hole, man.
It is huge!

Must have taken them
forever to dig it.

Doug's titties must have
been jiggling like
a bowl full of jell-o.

Help!

Help!

Help! Somebody help me!

Help!

Did you guys
hear that?
What?

Listen.

Don't be a spaz.
It was just the wind.

No, no, no. It sounded
like it came from
underground or something.

Lay off the drugs,
Stevie boy.

You first.
You found it.

All right. Hold this.

It sounds like they're still
cleaning up in the kitchen.
We better hurry.

Hey! I think I found it.

Why does your dad
have all this stuff?

He lost a lot of
friends in that accident.

I guess it's his way
of keeping their
memories alive.

What's that?
I'm not sure.

A friend of
Barry's father.

It looks like
he lost his wife and twins
in some accident.

Then he died in the mines
with the others.

Go! Go! Go!

What about the ghoul?
What's it say?

Not much. Just that
some noises were heard
before the collapse.

One man saw something.
An animal walking
on two feet, he said.

An animal walking
on two feet?

What do you
think it was?

I don't know.

You boys want
ice cream for dessert?

Sure thing, mom!

Let's get out of here.

All right, it's under here.
Here, help me move this thing.

Look, there's a rope.

See? I told you.

Nice job, Steve.

How far
does it go?

I don't know.

Well, figure it out, stupid.

We can't be here all night.
The storm's coming.

See anything?

You're the one
with the light. Here.
Toss it down to me.

Ah, it stinks
down here.

We're in a cemetery,
you dweeb.

Maybe it's those guys.

Maybe they're
pissing down here.

Crapping, too, so they
don't gotta run home.

All right.
Let's find this place.

I'll take this tunnel.
You go into that one.

No, there's no way
I'm going down
there by myself.

You are such
a little bitch.
What about me?

You stay here and watch
out for old man Smeltzer.

Why does she get
the flashlight?

She's more of a man
than you are.

Now, let's go.
We gotta hurry.

Could you imagine exploring
that tunnel tonight
in this rain?

The thing's
probably flooded. We might
need a boat tomorrow.

Yeah, I guess so.
I suppose we'll find out
tomorrow night.

Thanks again
for letting me stay here.

It would have been
a long walk home
in this rain.

No problem.
Mom said I'm even allowed

To have you and Barry over
at the same time

When my birthday
rolls around.

That should be fun.
Back when I lived
in New York,

I was never allowed
to have any of
my friends over.

At least your mom cares.

Sometimes I wish my mom
would ask me where I was
going, what I was doing.

She cares, man.
She just has a funny way
of showing it.

Seriously, you know
she loves you, right?

That's just it.
She loves me too much.

Hey!

Doug, what is it?
You can tell me.

Promise you won't
tell anyone.
Not anyone. Not a soul.

I promise.

She...

Oh...

She comes to me at night.
In my room.

When I'm sleeping.
She touches me.

She made me
promise not to tell.

Says it's our secret,
says that if I
tell somebody,

My dad might
never come back.

How long has
this been going on?

It started
after my dad left.

She lost her nursing job
and started drinking.

She just sits there,
in front of the tv,
crying for hours.

<i>So now I lock
my door at night.</i>

Being here tonight,
with your mom and dad.
Eating dinner,

And playing games
and watching movies,
it felt so nice.

So normal.
That's what a real family
must feel like, you know?

I wish I had that.
You don't know how lucky
you've got it, man.

I know. Believe me, I know.

I don't want to
go home tomorrow.

I wish I could
just stay here.

Look, when we get up
in the morning, let's talk
to my parents about it.

Maybe we can...
No!

You promised.

You can't tell anybody.
Not even Barry.

It'll be okay, Doug.
You'll see.
It'll all be okay.

All right,
what are we looking for?

Their stash, you airhead.

Comics. Porn mags.
Stuff like that.

This place is huge.
It must have taken
them forever to dig it.

Shut up! Point the light
over there. There's something
up ahead.

What the hell is that?

There's water.
Son of a bitch, dude!

You gotta be kidding me!

We found it.
It's gotta be behind here.

Ah!

You idiot. I can't see.

Let me find my lighter.
This is crazy.

There's something down here!
Good night, Sammie.

Help me! Please!

You shouldn't play
where you are not invited.

Who is it?

Stop!
Hey!

Hey!

You all right?
What happened?

Nothing. I'm fine.
Just move over.

<i> Don't you have
work today, dad?</i>

We need to talk.

What's going on?

I know you've had
some trouble in the past
with Ronny Nace,

Samantha Glatfelter,
and Steve Laughman.

I know
they're not exactly
friends of yours, but...

Are they in jail
or something?

No. They're missing.

Missing?
Like they ran away?

We think it's best
if you stick close to home
for the next few days.

Dad...

Don't argue with me, Timmy.

Sounds like voices.

They are not voices,
they are echoes.

We're never getting
out of here.

Go ahead. Knock.

You knock. It's your turn.
I knocked last time.

He's with his friends.
A place.

I don't know is
not a place. Where is he?

He's playing with
his friends. He's a kid.

He's in the cemetery.
The one place
I said not to go. Isn't he?

Listen, don't sit down
on me, girl.
He's in the cemetery.

"not to go to the cemetery."
where's the one place
I let him...

I'm sorry.

When I say watch my boy,
I mean watch my boy, don't I?

Yes.
Yeah.

And what happens
when you don't?

Why don't they do something
about that?

Barry could tell the cops.
They'd lock his old man up.

Maybe he's afraid to.
I could understand that.

You could call too, you know.
About your mom.

My mom's not
anything like him.

Just because she's not
beating you, doesn't mean
she's not hurting you.

I don't
want to talk about it, okay?
Let's just find Barry.

If that's what you want.

Barry! Get out here!

I don't have all day
for this crap. Here...

Next time that groundhog
pops his head up,

I want you to blast
the hell out of him.

I'm gonna find out
why the police are still
hanging around here.

What's that?
What?

There. On the other
side of the bushes. See it?

Is this Pat Kemp's car?

I think it is.

Oh, God. Oh!

Macy McCoy on the scene
of a gruesome discovery

That investigators found
this morning of a young male.

We will keep you updated
with any further information.

You're trying to tell me
you have no idea
whose car that is?

Jesus christ, how many times
do I have to say it?
I know it's church property.

I'll be contacting you
and your parents
for further questioning.

Okay, guys?
Yes, sir.

All right. Thank you.

Are you okay?

I don't feel so good.

I just wish my dad was here.
Maybe I should go home.

If you need me,
or if anything starts
to happen, call our house.

I'll come over.

Screw my curfew.
This is more important.
I'll sneak out.

Thanks, man. I gotta
lie down or something.

Remember, if you
need me, I'll be there.

Hey.
Hey.

I'm... I'm sorry about...
Well, you know.

They said there's no sign
of my sister. Something bad
has happened. I know it.

She's not coming back.

Don't say that.

She could still be okay.

Maybe. I don't know...

Never seen one
like this before.

What do you think it means?

I don't know.

It looks religious.

I-N-I-R-I...
That's what's on the pulpit
at the front of the church.

Do you know what it means?

No.

That there is
an old powwow charm.

Oh, hey there, reverend.

Hello, Timmy.
You doing okay?

Yes, sir.
Good.

I was going to ask
you the same thing.

Well, don't worry about me.

You know,
back when our ancestors

Used to believe in magic,
they sometimes placed

Powwow charms like this one
in a cemetery for protection

Against evil spirits
and other creatures.

Creatures? Like the ghoul?

Well, I don't know
about the ghoul.

But there's a legend.
There's an old legend that

This church was once
bedeviled by a demon.
A demon made flesh.

And when the beast
was defeated,

It was buried in a chamber
somewhere in the cemetery.

Could be this tombstone
was erected and those

Symbols carved on it to
keep the demon trapped.

Sounds like the ghoul,
the one everyone talks about.

Well, we better get going.

I don't want to worry
your mother any more
than we need to.

Please say hello to
your parents for me, Timmy.
Sure thing, reverend.

See you on Sunday.
You bet.

Come in.

What you doing, kiddo?

Just listening to some music.
Pat Kemp gave it to me.

He always was nice to us.

I see.

Do you wanna talk
about what happened today?

I think I'm okay, mom.

I heard it was pretty bad.
Did you see much?

Not really.

Well, it must have been
very upsetting for you.

I'm sorry you had to
go through all that.

Mom, if it's okay,
can we not talk about it?

All right.

But promise me,
if you need to,
you'll come talk to me, okay?

Promise.

All right.

Doug? You home?

Yeah, mom. It's me.

Were you gone last night?

Yeah.

Have you watched the news?

No. Why? Are you on it?

Maybe. I'm not sure, really.
Some bad stuff happened.

What'd you do?

Nothing.

Me and Timmy found
Pat Kemp's body in the woods,

So the police
might need to talk to me.

Are the police coming here?

I don't know.

I don't want you
talking to policemen.

They might make you say
things you don't mean.

You understand?

Yes, ma'am.

Awesome.

What the hell?

Okay, this guy's a creep.

What the hell?

Oh, man. I wonder how
much trouble Barry got into?

I don't want to
think about it.

Yeah, even my mom
calls him a "nasty drunk."

Is that nasty enough for you?

Let go. You're hurting me.

You're damn right I am, boy.

I thought I told
the two of you I...
Dad...

Keep your mouth shut, boy.

You were probably out
here breaking in with them,
weren't you?

What'd I tell you about
coming out here without me?

You can just
stay on your knees.

What?
You heard me.

Stay on your knees!

Why don't you just leave
him alone, you bastard?

What'd you just
say to me, boy?

You heard me, you drunk.

You're good at hitting
women and little kids.

Why can't you beat on
somebody your own size?

You know, I've
warned you before, Graco.

Somebody needs to do
something about that
smart mouth of yours.

Go ahead. Hit me.

Timmy. Shut up.

Dad! Put him down!

Please. Mr. Smeltzer.

Now you listen.
And you listen good.

If I ever see you
or your tubby little friend

Here playing
in this cemetery again,

I'm gonna tan your hides
so bloody,

Even your mothers
are not gonna recognize you.

I don't want you playing
with these two boys anymore.

But, dad!
They're my best friends!

Back talk me again, boy!

Now you wipe
your little noses,

And you fix
your little dresses,

And you go running
home to your mommies.

And don't ever let me catch
you playing out here again.
Now get the hell out of here.

I said go!

We should do the same thing to
him as we did to that dog.

Yeah. And look what
happened when we did.

That wasn't really our fault.
That was Barry.

I read something in one of
my comic books. It said

That, "when you look
into the abyss, the abyss
also looks into you."

My grandpa told me
that it means, when you
fight with monsters,

You have to be careful not to
turn into a monster yourself.

Well, what do we do now?

Let's walk over
to the woods. Maybe
we can find something cool.

But your parents said
we're not supposed to.

We'll be fine.
It's daytime anyways.
They'll never find out.

Barry, honey?

It's okay to come out.

He's gone.

Please, baby,
let me look at you.
Let me take care of you.

Please?

Oh, God...

I'm so sorry about this.

I tried to stop him,
but you know how he gets.

I don't know what's
going on with him right now.

But, a few years ago,

Back when your daddy
still worked in the mines,

A friend of his
came to ask a favor.

Clark had just
been promoted.

<i>He was in charge
of at least a dozen works
down there now.</i>

<i>And this friend wantd
your father to give m
the day off.</i>

<i>Said something was wrong
with his wife and he need
to be home with her.</i>

But there was a bonus

For your father
if he finished the job early.

So Clark told
the man it was nothing

And he couldn't take
the day off of work just
because his wife

Wasn't feeling well.

<i>But that was wrong.</i>

Your father has never
forgiven himself for the
death of that man's family.

He has never
been the same since.

I'm not trying to
make excuses for him.

But I wanted you to know
the demons that he
has been fighting.

And losing.

I'm not gonna let him
do this to us anymore.

Doug?

Open the door for mommy.

Oh. Come on, Doug.

I got a present for you.

It's a surprise.
Let me in and I'll show you.

Quit being a baby.
Mommy needs a man!

Douglas Elmore Keiser,
you open this door right now!

Open the door right now!

No more.

No more! No more!

I'm not doing this anymore!

I'm not doing it anymore!

What you give me
is not enough.

It's not enough
for what I gotta pay.
So I'm not doing it no more!

What you're giving me
is not enough.

Is not enough!

At night, when I try
and sleep I can hear them
screaming in my head.

I can hear them
screaming in my head.

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Oh, shit! Hey!

Good boy.

What the heck?

Where are you,
you little bastard?
Answer me!

I seen ya back here!
Come out, now!

You're just making it
worse for yourself, kid!

Answer me!

Answer me! Answer me!

Answer me, you little punk!
You want me to come
down there after ya?

You don't want me
following you, kid!

You know I know
who your parents are!

He messed up
your back, too?

He messed up my whole body.
Even my bruises have bruises.
It'll be okay.

I'll be okay.
It's not as bad as it looks.

You really should
see a doctor, man.

Yeah. Well, I didn't
want to leave without
saying good-bye.

Stay, Barry.
We'll figure something out.

How?

I don't know. But we will.

You, me, and Doug.
You can't break up
a good team like that.

Besides, you can't
leave until morning.
It's too dangerous at night.

What? You mean,
like, the disappearances?

Yeah. But it's
more than that.
I've found out a few things.

There is this tombstone
in the old section
of the cemetery,

With strange markings on it.

I talked to reverend Moore
about it.

He said that the townspeople
used to trap demons
and ghouls.

To keep them from
coming back to life again,
they used these stones

Like magical charms.

Only, the one I found
was cracked in half.

So?

Don't you see?

From the ghoul
all these years
is now broken!

There's nothing to stop it.

Dougie?

Doug?

Doug?

I just thought Timmy
might know where he is.

How long has he been gone?

I don't know!

When I went to his room to
check on him, he was gone.

And the window
was wide open.

He's never done this before.

Do you want me to
call the police?

No.

I didn't know! I didn't know!

Listen, listen, listen.

Let me go wake up Timmy,
and, and I'll see if he knows
anything, okay?

Come on inside. Come on.
It's okay.

I'm so sorry.

No, it's okay.

I'm so sorry.

Come on, it's okay.

We gotta get out of here.
Doug's in trouble.

Where do you
think he would go?

There's only one
place he would go.

The dugout?

He's gotta be there.
Hiding out like a groundhog.

How should we do this?

Well, I've got my
pocket knife for protection,
but what do you have?

Up there.
My dad's hunting rifle.

We use it to clear out
the groundhogs.

Are you okay?

What is all this stuff?

What? What is it, man?

My grandfather's
freemason ring.

He wore it at the funeral.
He was buried with it.

That doesn't make any sense.
How is that possible?

You ever wondered
why your old man brings home
so many nice things?

Earrings for your mom,
a gold watch...

We better get this
cleaned up
or we're both dead.

Then we'll get that rifle.

Wait a second.

What?

What's that?

Wait. Where's the lantern?
We always keep it
hanging right here.

Where are you going?

Oh, my God!

What is it?

Doug.

No.

He's gone down that hole.
We gotta go after him.

But how are we
going to stop the ghoul?

Well, I read something
in one of my comic books.

A comic book?

I know, man,
but hear me out.

These comic books
are based on stuff
that really happened.

The way
they stopped the ghoul
was to track it down,

Tie it up, and drag it
into the daylight.

So? What happened?

It burns up.
It can't survive
in the light.

That's how we stop it!

It sounds crazy.

Look, I'll head
down into the tunnels.

You take your dad's backhoe
and dig open
the sunken graves.

When the sun comes up,
the tunnels will flood
with light.

If I start up the backhoe
in the middle of the night,

Someone's gonna hear it
and call the cops.

Good. Let them, man.
Doug is down there,
right now, with that thing.

All right. What the hell.

Be careful.

You've done it now, boy,
haven't you? Yeah?

Oh, God...

Timmy?

Karen? Are you okay?

I... We...

He hurt us. He did things.

Please...

Do you know how to open this?

You think
we would be here
if she knew?

We have tried,
but we are too weak.

Sammie?

Just hurry, okay? Please.
He could come back
at any moment.

Come on.

Come on.

I only have this one
flashlight,

So you'll have to
stay close. Okay?

Okay.

He's coming!

It's too late!

Doug?

Timmy?
What are you doing here?

We don't have time.
We have to get out
of here before it comes back.

Run! Everybody run!

Quick! Down this way!

Run!

Keep moving!

Run! Down this way!

Oh, wait. Wait!

What's going on?

Come on! Run!

Come on, Doug!

I bet you've never seen me
run that fast before, huh?

You did good, Doug.

You guys all right?

Yeah. We're all right.

Okay, let's get out of here.

You all right?

You all right?
Yeah.

Timmy, get away!
