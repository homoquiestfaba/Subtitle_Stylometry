Come on...

Oh, come on!

Ethan?
Catie... Where's Suzie?

She's not here.

I know she doesn't want to see me, but if you just...
No, Ethan...

...she's really not here.

Catie.

I love her.

Please.

She loves you too, but she has
already left for the airport.

You'll never gonna
make it in time!

Can I help you?

I thought you
were leaving.

I thought I would.

I love you.

You know Suzie, life doesn't give
you a lot of second chances.

And if I've learned anything, I've learned that
you've got to make the most of the moment...

No!

Honey, it just feels
'formulate' to me.

This is the kind of stuff that
happens in every love story...

...but this is not the kind of
stuff that happens in real life.

But it is not real.
It's a... story.

For someone who has never
published anything before...

If you want to break through, you've
got to do something with 'heart'.

Something with sincerity, something
that feels like you really mean it.

Even in a romance,
it has to feel realistic.

That's what I'm trying to do,
draw from real life...

...model the character after my
own experience.

That's another problem.

That's just not the kind
of 'reality' I'm talking about.

Don't get me wrong...

You seems like a
very nice kid.

But for your leading man, even...
you need a 'leading man'!

You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident...

...and charismatic,
and sexy.

No offense. In real life,
girls end up settling for...

...nice guys all the time but
you see, even this is my point.

This is why they go to the movies and
they need to read the romance novels.

They want to read them
because they want to see...

...girls like them fallin' in love
with guys who aren't like you!

Okay, so, you're telling me you wanted
to be realistic, but 'not' realistic.

Exactly.

I don't understand.

Ethan, your writing
is not bad.

It's pretty good, actually.
It's funny!

Thank you.

It's just not something
we can publish.

Ethan...

I've been watching you coming here
for a long time, trying to make...

...something happen, and I have to
tell you it's just not happening.

I'm very sorry.

Please... There's got to
be something else I can do.

Of course, there is so much
stuff that you can do.

You are young...

...and you have the whole future ahead
of you to figure out what to do...

...but just don't... don't
get hung up on writing.

Ethan, I'm so sorry.
I have somebody waiting.

Right, you're... uh...

Thank you for your time.

Hey, Ethan!

You know what I'm
gonna do?

I'm gonna have Allison
validate your parking.

You hold on.

Oh, it's... I didn't drive...
Allison...

Allison, when this young man comes out,
would you validate his parking, please?

"Our Spry
is doing just that. "

"Which means that it
keeps your teeth clean. "

"It's sugar but
it's 'not' sugar... "

"And it's good for
your teeth. "

"Spry gum.
Stay free, less filling. "

"With gum so good, we don't
need a professional spokesman. "

Hello!

Hi!

What's it gonna be today?
Just a black coffee to go.

Anything else?

Yeah! Dinner at my house.
Any Sunday, you name it!

I think I can make that happen.
Excellent!

You've been playing
hard to get.

Should I bring dessert?
I wouldn't have invited you, otherwise.

So, eh...
just you there?

...and David.

Well, David is always invited.

I just meant that you could always bring
someone who is not your brother, you know.

Uncle Logan...
I just say...

Enough.

If don't ask, how am I supposed to know
if there's anyone worth asking about?

When you there is, you'll
be the first to know.

"When" or "if"?

Ouch!

I know it's scary.

But it gets less scary when
you put yourself back out there.

Sooner or later, you'll gonna
have to just take a leap.

'Later' is a lot harder
than 'sooner', believe me.

I know. I just don't
know if I'm ready yet.

You want to know a secret?
Yeah?.

No one... is ever ready. That's
why they called it 'the leap'.

And if you wait 'till you're ready,
you're going to wait forever.

Oops!

Hospital?
Naturally.

What is the damage?
On the house. Doctor's discount.

I know you're thinking
about cops.

Doctors actually pay for
their drinks.

Get out of here before
I change my mind!

Call me!
I will. 'Bye!

Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

No, no, no, that's okay. I was
just writing out some thoughts.

Is that a diary?

No, it's a... journal.

Must be some pretty
deep stuff.

Not really.

Then it must be 'psycho-perverted'.
What? No, nothing like that.

Well, if it's a journal, it has to be
one or the other.

I'll go with 'deep'.
That is a good choice.

The world has enough
perverts in it already.

Hi.
Hi.

So, do I make it?

Did you go make it?

Yeah, in your journal.

How much impact does someone
has to have on your life...

...before you immortalized them
in your personal record?

Eh... well, like I said, it's just really
a bunch of thoughts. It's kinda random.

How much 'random' do I
have to be?

How much more
'random' can you be?

I tell you what? I can... name
a character after you some time.

So, you're really a writer?
Like for a living?

Well, that's what I tell
people to impress them.

No, I'm... I'm really a writer. I
just don't really make a living in it.

Have you ever tried to get published?
Used to.

Used to get published?
Used to 'try'.

Until when?

Eh... pretty recently,
actually.

You should keep
trying.

Too late. Gave up...
about an hour ago.

Well, that's a mistake.

I mean, if haven't had any luck,
it is because you're publishing...

...the wrong stuff. Maybe
you should try something new?

Like what?

Hmmm... there's this guy
who walks into a cafe.

He's nice...
but desperate.

Oh! desperate?
Yup! He is a total loser.

Ready to give
all up.

But then, he meets
this girl.

The single most amazing woman
he has ever met in his life.

And she inspires him.

Convinces him not to
give up hope.

And then what?

I don't know.

You're the writer.
I just provide the inspiration!

Hey, wait!

If I need some inspiration, Can
I, maybe, call you and get some?

Inspiration, I meant get
some inspiration.

Well... desperate!

Alright.

Okay.

But I just want
to warn you.

I do not inspire well
on an empty stomach.

Okay. Oh, wait, how is your name?

I'm Jesse.

Jesse...

Excuse me?

Hi, I called an order for
pick-up. My name is Troy.

I go check then.

Thank you.

"How important
is your vision to you?"

"Cataract specialist delay
the guess work. "

My brother and I die when that
commercial comes on.

So brilliant!

You think so?

Yeah, don't you?

Well I...

What?

That's actually my commercial.
Your commercial?

Well, That's what I do.
I make television commercials.

I don't even know you and
I've already called you brilliant.

Makes me feel slightly better
about being a sell-out...

...devoting my life to consumerism
that suppose to contribute...

...to something actually artistic
to society.

Well, commercials are the 'art'
of today's society.

My mom used to tell me that.
And I reminded him of his mother.

I think she just thrilled that I'm
not starving after I told her...

...I wanted to be a writer rather
than going to school for a real career.

Well, I'm sure she's
very proud.

She's my mom.
She have to be.

Thank you.
Sure.

As a general rule, I try
not to be one of these...

...crazy men who ask random girls he meets
in restaurants for their phone numbers.

But I have this strange feeling that if
I don't make an exception this one time...

...I'm really going
to regret it.

See, then, I'll have to come all the way
back here, order this stuff all over again...

Canned food is not very good
here anyway.

On top of everything else, I have to find
some way to strike up a conversation...

...with you and I will have to come
up with some witty clever remarks.

So, you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

So, the way I see it is... if you
actually gave me your phone number now...

You'll be helping me
out a great deal.

You make it sound like an
act of charity on my part.

I don't think there's any other way
you can possibly see it.

Okay, then.

Thank you, Jesse.
Sure.

You've done
the right thing today.

Okay, 'bye.
'Bye.

Hi.
Hi! I'm looking for Jesse.

Sure.
Come on in.

Thanks.

Wow.

I'm her brother, David.
Hey, Ethan.

Jess!
Ethan is here!

Okay!
I'll be right out!

I'm sorry, you look familiar
to me. Have we met?

I don't think so. Probably just...
The 'Gum Guy'!

You are the 'Gum Guy',
right?

That's it, right?

Jesse!

S...

Hi!
Hi. You look great!

Thanks.
Are you ready?

Yeah. You didn't tell me
your brother is a 'big celebrity'.

I didn't want to brag.

'Bye.
'Bye.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you,
Ethan.

Have fun!

Stay up late!

Did I ignore your brother?
I mean, I didn't mean to...

No, no, no, he's...

...just had a hard time dealing
with his 'celebrity'.

Those commercials are huge! He's
got to be awesome for an actor.

Yeah, but that's just it.
He is not an 'actor'.

What do you mean?

Well, like three years ago, Spry
chewing gum ran this big promotion...

...where people would win prizes
in packs of gum, right, mostly...

...small stuff like t-shirts,
and baseball hats, and... gum.

And It turns out that Spry
was looking for a regular guy...

...to be their new
spokesperson.

David... was that
regular guy.

Next thing we know, he signed a
contract to be in their commercial...

...for a lifetime supply
of chewing gum.

The only problem was,
my brother...

...doesn't exactly have
what you would call...

...'charisma'.
Cut!

Spry gum. with a
hundred percent Tylon...

Xili-xil-xylitol?

With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.
With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.

Cut!
Here? Or here?

That's fine. Right there!
Or here?

Or there?
That's fine!

It is hard when the words are
right there, and I'm suppose...

...to say, but I'm suppose to
look there? How do I say the words?

Smile!
I am.

Smile bigger!

Like that?
'Xi-li-tol'!

Spry Gum...

...taste great, less filling.. s.

No! No! That's weird! Smile,
smile like a normal person.

I'm pretty sure you
can't actually say that.

That is someone else's slogan.
Cut!

Spr...

Do you have something for my ears?
Because my ears are very hot?

Spry gum. It's like...

...mint.

But you chew 'em and they never go away.
Cut!

I totally thought that he was acting.
But really? That's just him?

He's been on TV non-stop
for the past three years.

And 'YouTube', who knows
how many times.

How long can they run those things?
As long as they want.

And all he's has to show
for it is free 'Spry'.

Oh, wow!

Wow, that's...

...'true' wow. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be...

No, it's okay. Pretty much
everyone find this funny, but David.

Sorry, looks like this is
gonna take a while.

Eh...

I think I know
a better place!

Oh, okay.

I haven't been here
for a long time.

Are you sure it's okay
for us to be here afterhours?

It's the best time to come.
Until the SWAT team shows up.

We're not
bothering anyone.

When I was little, my dad usually
bring my brother and I here.

All the time we used
to watch games.

Hmmm... are you close
to your dad?

He died when I was twelve.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

It's okay.

It was a long time ago.
And yes, we were close.

But I'm just happy I got to spend the
time with him like I did, you know.

And my uncle Logan...

...his brother, kinda stepped in
and became like a second dad.

So that helped a lot.

How about you?
How about your family?

Eh, my parents have been
happily married for 40 years.

Wow!
That's impressive.

Well, they are.

What is their secret?
Well, beats me.

My dad always said that they fell in
love the first night that they met.

I don't know. Do you think
that's even possible?

I think I felt like that once.
Really?

What happened?

Well... we dated...

...and then we got engaged.
And then we got married.

And then we got
divorced.

The longer version of the story?
The long and the short of it, yeah.

So what was it?
Was he just the wrong guy?

I just wasn't the
right girl.

Come on,
I doubt that.

Oh, I know. Shocking, isn't it?
It is shocking.

Oh... I loved him.

We were married
over three years.

I tried...

I really tried to make
it work.

But?

But... eh... ultimately,
I wasn't what he wanted.

How's that for ruining
our first date?

Not even close.

Once I've got a girl who got back with
her boyfriend through a text message...

...while we were at dinner.

Oh, oh...

Yeah, you've got to
work a lot harder to beat that.

Oh... wow!

It's funny how life never turns
out the way you think it will.

Yeah...

When I was a little girl,
I thought I'd be married...

...and have four kids
by now.

Instead I'm divorced and...
don't even have a plant.

Come on, you've got lots of time.
I bet you will be a great mom.

When I was a kid I thought I
would be a Pulitzer Prize winner.

And instead, I spent most
of my days punching toilets.

Hobby of yours?

No, I managed
the building I live in.

Maintenance for
free rent. Can't beat it...

Hmmm... looks like
you're handy.

Never met a radiator
I couldn't handle.

Like twelve when I'm old,
whatever.

So...
no first date regrets?

Absolutely not.

You?

Absolutely not...

...yet.

Great.

Oh! Shit!

Sorry.
It's okay.

Sorry.

Here we go!

So, this is it...

Yeah, if by 'it' you mean all there
is, then, this is definitely 'it'.

Oh, that's my niece
and nephew.

Sweet!

That, that is just a thing...
it's like a good luck charm.

They say that everything we own
tells a story about who we are.

Yeah? Then, what does
that say?

That you're old school.
This isn't new. It's an original.

Pre-Hayden.

This is Kenner, gonna say
like... 1977.

Okay, that's the hardest thing
a girl ever said to me.

Don't be too impressed. I
have a brother, remember?

'My Little Pony' was more of my thing.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah, and I have a favorite,
'Firefly'.

And she was pink,
with a turquoise mane...

And I brought her with me everywhere.
She was like a security blanket...

Oh, sorry!

You weren't big enough
to actually keep her.

Oh, I would have, but
sadly we lost...

...'Firefly' on a
family vacation.

I'm sure wherever she is,
she's very happy.

Just as long as she's a
well adjusted adult pony.

Yeah, I'm going to use the little boy's
room. Could I trust you to behave yourself?

No. I'm gonna sniff around
everywhere.

Great.

So, you better hurry.
Don't worry, I'm dope for speed.

That's hot!

I meant in the bathroom. That
sounds better. I'll be right back.

Okay...

Alright...

Hey!

Hi.

Oh... is this okay?

Yeah, yeah, no,
it's fine.

I just forgot that
I left it out.

It's really good.
No, really? No.

Really?

Is all your stuff like this?

Eh... some of it.

It's mostly short stories,
really.

And some longer stories. That's a poetry,
a couple of screenplays nothing much.

You know, I really don't
let people read stuff.

You said you tried to get published.
I said I used to try.

I don't know, I thought that I was going
to make a living doing this, but I...

...discovered that it was
really hard...

...to get people to pay
your rent.

Maybe you just need
some more time.

Maybe.

Or maybe you sucked.

Maybe.

What I've read
seemed really good.

Ehmm... Ugh! Well...

I know.

Oh, it must have been...
some date.

Yeah, it was somethin'.

Are you too sleepy for breakfast?
Never too sleepy for breakfast.

Good, because it's
'eggs' time!

And I've got some
coffee brewing too.

So, tell me...

Is there any future with this guy?
Depends.

Depends on what?

Troy! It's good to see you! We've got you at the
back a table if you're going in to dine with her.

Thanks.
Yeah.

Thanks, Cory.

I take it that you
come here a lot.

Well, I'm a creature of habit.
I work just down the street.

So, do you bring
all your dates here?

Just the ones I really
want to impress.

Well, I should tell you that
I'm not easily impressed...

...by a fancy place.
Well, I have to work harder to impress you.

I'm waiting.
Now?

Oh, okay, I can spell the
word 'Connecticut'.

Great, let's hear it!

Alright, you got me.

How long have you
been coming here?

Eh, about since we started the
agency. So, about four years.

Since 'we started the agency'?
My partner and I.

Oh, you have a partner?
I thought it was your place.

Pretty lame!

But still, four years, that's...
that's impressive.

Oh!

Got it.

That is impressive too!

Ah...

Well, I had a...
really nice time.

I don't blame you.
Well! Narcissism is hot.

So is sarcasm.
Well, you can work on that next time.

So, you're assuming that there's
going to be a next time?

I hope so.

We'll see.

Good night.

Good night.

I can't even remember
the last time I did this.

You see, that is exactly
why you need to be doing it.

Really? That's why?

Well, and the fact that I need to assert
my manhood by challenging you to an...

...activity that I know
I can win.

I think most guy
would have picked bowling.

No, too risky
You might beat me.

And if I did?

Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere
near enough self-esteem to keep this up...

...a blow like that.
So...

Couldn't you just challenge me to something else?
Not really good at a lot of things.

Dreamy...

Listen, is it safer for any...

...possible relationship
that we 'mini-golf'...

...'coz... baby, I'm great at this!

All right.
Show me what you've got.

That's right...

So, when was the last time you went
'golfing'? - Does 'miniature-golf' count?

I'm afraid not.

I love it out here, I try
to come as much as I can.

Alright... ladies first!

Oh, really? Okay.

Okay, ready?
Okay.

Oh, promise me that you're not
going to tell anyone about that.

I try not to make promises that I
absolutely have no intention of keeping.

I'm old-fashioned,
that way.

I don't understand what is it with
this obsession guys have with golf?

I wouldn't call it an obsession.
Have I seen all the movies?

Yes. More than once? Yes.

If you ask me what planet Chewbacca's
from? I would say Kashyyyk.

But does that really cause
me to have an obsession?

I'm not saying that
they're not great movies.

They are. You know, how
many of them do we need?

I don't know. How many times did
they remake 'Pride and Prejudice'?

One a year, every year?

Mr. Darcy expressing
his undying devotion?

You can't see that
too many times.

You see, I feel the same way.
Just take up Mr. Darcy...

Instead of Princess Leia and replace the
look of undying devotion with a golf keen.

Okay, I can live with that, just as
long as your taste in music isn't lame.

What's your favourite kind?
Don't think, just answer.

Classic rock.

What do you consider 'classic'?
Anything but 'country'.

What's the worst date you've ever been on?
Besides this?

You know I have the keys
to the car, right?

Favorite president?

Rutherford B. Hayes.

You can't just
make up a name...

So, how's the writing going?
Well, pretty well, actually.

Better than it's been
a long time, I think.

Starting something new.

Can I read it?
It depends...

Can you be honest with me about what you
think or are you one of those girls...

...who's gonna be like, "Oh, I
love it"? Then, stop calling me.

I think I'm totally
incapable of false praise...

It's like... a natural
deficiency or something.

Then, you're on.

I love this building.
Oh, me too.

The view from the
roof is amazing!

I've never seen it.

You're kidding?

You've never seen it?
No!

Well, we gotta check this out.
I'm sure it has been closed for hours.

Yeah, you're right, although
I wonder if this would...

...do anything.

Have you lived
in any place else?

Not yet.

You planning on movin'?
I don't know. Maybe someday.

Not me,
I like it here.

My sister is here, my niece
and nephews are here...

I know this town like
the back of...

I'm so...

Ouch... agile,
coordinated?

Yeah and...
really sorry.

Wow...

Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

Wow!

Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

Your aunt kicked me out of the dining
room... so that I should be helping you.

Here. Slice the bread.

She told me she wants you to help!
Don't believe his lies!

I never do.

So...

How are things?
My things are good.

David tells me your love-life has
taken a recent leap in activity.

Yeah, you could
say that.

Well, you could say that
as if it's a bad thing.

I just want to be honest.

No one ever said that you
have to reveal everything...

...to any guy you date.

No, I know, I know
but still I just...

You just give yourself some time.
Nothing wrong with taking it slow.

That's 'big' talk coming from a guy who
said he fell in love with aunt Linda...

...the second he laid
eyes on her.

That was different.

With me, one girl is all it took. I hit
the 'jackpot' first time I took the gamble.

How did you know
that she was the one?

She, eh...

She inspired me.

<i>Remember that rainy evening
I took you out</i>

<i>With nothing but
a fine-tuned comb...</i>

<i>I know no one's to blame
but then what a shame...</i>

<i>Hey baby, won't you please
come home!</i>

I can't believe you've never been here.
Only because I've never wanted to come.

This place is all musicals.
That's all I need to hear.

How do you not like musicals?
They don't make any sense.

Musicals make total sense.
What's your favorite musical?

'West Side Story'.
It makes no sense.

It's 'Romeo and Juliet'.

It's two gangs dancing
while they fight.

Okay, so next, you're going to
tell me you hate 'Sounds Of Music'.

Oh, please you askin'
me of the 'singing' nuns.

But you have to like 'Grease'.
No, I have to do no such things.

Everyone likes 'Grease'.

The only nice thing I can say about
'Grease' is that there's not a 'Grease 2'.

I happen to love 'Grease 2'.
'Shut your mouth'.

I'm not going to apologize
for loving 'Grease 2'.

'Grease 2' should apologize
to 'Grease 2'.

Have you ever seen it?
No, I've never seen it!

Okay, so how could you judge a movie
you've never seen?

I don't have to see 'Grease 2'
to know it's 'Grease 2'.

<i>I don't iron his shirts...</i>

<i>I don't sew on his buttons...</i>

<i>I don't know of all
the jokes he tells...</i>

<i>...or the songs he hums.</i>

<i>But he says he loves me...</i>

<i>And I believe it's true...</i>

<i>Doesn't that makes someone...
belong to you?</i>

Subtitles: Maver. ikk

Okay, open 'em.

Wow!

What's the occasion?

It's Tuesday!

How did you arranged
all these?

Well, I think secrets are an important
part of every relationships.

Wouldn't you agree?

You've no idea.

This is the best place in
the city to look at the stars.

Are you a man who knows
his constellations?

You mean 'the constellations' man?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Alright, see those three near each other,
but they're branching off at the top...

...in different directions?
That's the 'eternal tree'.

What about that one?

Oh, that's my favorite.
That's the 'Lion's Triumph'.

Meaning?
I have no idea. I just want to sound smart.

It almost works.

How about that one
over there?

Well, no clue.

Maybe we should name it.

Yeah, we can call it...
'Jesse'.

You want to name it after me?
Well, Yeah, I really like you.

I really like you too.

No, no, no,
I like... 'LIKE' you.

Meaning, em...
I think I'm falling for you.

I know... I know I'm falling
for you.

I'm freaking you out right now.
Maybe I should just kiss you.

Hey.
Hey.

Good date?

Yeah, great date.

What?

Nothing, just sounds like
it's getting serious.

Maybe.

What?

I didn't say anything.

Ethan has made it perfectly clear that
I don't have to tell him...

...anything until I'm ready.

I have to figure out how
I'm going to figure this out.

Sure... I mean take
your time.

Let me just...
lay it all out there.

Tell Ethan everything.

Am I making a mess?

No.

Maybe, I don't know.

I'm gonna tell him
the next time I see him.

And if he leaves me, then...
problem solved, right?

I mean, if he doesn't think
I'm worth it...

...then, he's an idiot.

Good night.

Good night.

Okay, I have to warn you. My
sister's house can be a little...

What?
Intense... at first.

You'll be great!

Hello?

Hello?
Uncle Ethan!

Hey, guys! This is my girlfriend, Jesse.
This is Hayley and Conner.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

You're pretty.

No, you're pretty!

No, I think all girls are dumb.
Hey!

Where are you goin'?
Get out of town, you monkey!

Alright, enough impressing
our guests.

Hey, Baggy.
Hello, Baggy.

Jesse, my sister, Sarah.
Hi, Sarah, nice to meet you.

Jesse, so good to meet you.
Welcome to the 'circus'.

Oh, that's Adam.
Our littlest.

Is he okay?
Oh, a little fuzzy today, but he's alright.

Hey, Bill! This is my
brother-in-law, Bill. This is Jesse.

Hi!
Hey! How are you? Bill Walters. Wow...

It's okay... it's okay.
Sorry.

Clearly, you can see, we keep a little informal
around here... Please just make yourself at home.

Dinner is almost ready.
I've gotta go to deal with the baby.

Come on, let's go wash up!
Let's go... go!

We've got some serious barbecue
going on out back.

But Ethan told me that
you're a vegetarian...

So, I got you some 'pork'.

Great!
For the others... not meat.

Get back here...

Hey.

Come on uncle Ethan!
Let's go play 'Spies Tag'!

You know what, buddy? I think we're
gonna stay here and relax a little bit.

No! Please, please!

Oh, how can you say
no to that?

Oh. Alright. I'll be right back.
I'm great at this game.

You better go,
I'll get you!

Hey, he really is good
at this game.

Yeah, he should be. He has had enough practice.
That's for sure.

Your children are beautiful.
Thank you.

They certainly love their uncle. It's
like having a 'on-call' babysitter.

If anything comes up...

Yeah, if we just wanna get away
for a couple of hours...

Bill!
Alright? It's true!

Oh, hello.
Hello...

Are you and uncle Ethan going to
get married and have a baby?

Oh, okay, Hayley, I think that
uncle Ethan needs to be chased.

Why don't you go chase him?
Okay.

Where are you gettin' off?
Where are you gettin' off?

Wahhh! I'm the 'Beast'!
Where? Where?...

Yes! I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

Thank you!

Nice meeting you, 'bye!

'Bye!

Okay, seriously I think I hurt something.
Those kids are so crazy about you!

Big 'E'!
And I'm crazy about them.

Thank you.
Yeah!

Oh... I almost forgot.
I found something of yours.

What?
Close your eyes.

Close!

Okay?

Okay.

Open.

It's 'Firefly'.
Yeah...

How did you...?
Where did you find...?

She just showed up on my doorstep
yesterday... in a box from ebay.

This is the nicest thing anyone
has ever given me.

Oh, come on,
I hope that's not true.

Thank you. - You're
welcome. - Thank you so much.

So, what did you
want to tell me?

What do you mean?

Oh, I hear you said you've something to tell
me but it could wait after my sister's house.

I, er...

What?

I just... wanted to tell
you how happy you make me.

Good. I like you happy.

Is that all you wanted to tell me?
Yeah!

You can talk to me about anything, you know that?
I know, I know, yeah.

Well, prove it.
You can talk to me right now.

There is nothing.

Okay.

Hi!.

I can help you?
I'm Jesse. I'm here to see Troy.

Troy, there is someone
here to see you.

Okay.

He'll be right out.
Thanks.

There she is!

Hi, T.

Alright, let me show
you around.

You doing alright?
Yeah, how's your day been?

Good, good.

Troy, I've got the Clear magazine
spread for you to look out.

Thanks, Mike, I'll stop by
your desk this afternoon.

Troy, can I get your opinion on this local survey?
Can I come by a little later?

Sure.
Thanks, Brandy.

Hey, Garrett!

I want you to meet Jesse.
Yes, Jesse...

Hi! I heard a lot about you.
Oh, good things, I hope.

Oh, pretty good.

Oh, Troy usually sensed really horrific
stuff about other people.

That's not true,
just about you.

I'm gonna show her around.
Well, you think you own the place?

No, Garrett, I think you own the place.
That's right... don't forget it.

Actually, you know, Jesse, we get
most of our clients...

...based on Troy's
reputation alone.

Well, don't you forget that.
I can't forget that.

We'll see you in a bit.
Okay dokey.

Very nice meeting you. - Nice meeting
you too, take care. - Okay, 'bye.

So, this is your home
during the day.

And some nights.

I spend so much time here, I figure I
might as well make it as comfortable...

...as a place can be
as possible.

It's really big.

Yeah, well, over compensating
for something, obviously.

I prefer not to
say what.

What are you
working on?

Oh... this is a
potential client.

I'm trying to come up with a
"slogan" for their nasal spray.

You know, if I can dazzle them,
they'll definitely sign with us.

You're pretty
dazzling.

It's a lot easier if you have a specific
audience, this 'nasal spray' is for everybody.

Everybody with a nose.

Yeah, well said.

Woo... I'm starving.
Can we talk about that?

Absolutely, tell me what's on your mind?
Wait! Come on!

<i>I see the sunbeam.
The perfect rain...</i>

<i>I want to send out a
gazillion bouquet...</i>

<i>I hear the chords
that resonate...</i>

<i>It's just another
o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

<i>I look from your eyes
down to your lips...</i>

<i>I feel it from my toes
down to my figertips...</i>

<i>I see the clouds change
a sweet array...</i>

<i>It's just another
o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

"NOW YOU HAVE A PLANT
LOVE, ETHAN"

<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

"JESSE, I LOVE YOU!
TROY"

<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

Oh, come on, no way!

Yes-way.
Don't act surprised.

No, look, something's wrong with this
controller. I press 'X' and nothing's happenin'.

Yeah, it's the
'controller's' fault.

Oh, shut up! I'm serious!
The thing is broken.

No, I think it's the guy who's using it, actually.
You know what?

You play this game all the time and
you know that controller works better...

Hi. Sorry.
Hi, wow.

I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know you were here!

Is everything okay?
Yeah! Just fine. David invited me over.

Will you pause it
please?!

He called and we got to talking. Did
you know that his cousin is a lawyer?

No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, he works in contracts, I...

...thought maybe he can help
him out with his 'gum' situation.

I was talking to his cousin,
he said that...

ZZZZZZZ...

He said that he thinks he can get
me out of the contract or at least...

...renegotiate so that they have to
pay me for as long as it's running.

That's amazing.

Will you guys go to the store with me
so that I don't have to go by myself?

Of course,
we're almost done here.

I bet you mean I
'destroyed' you.

Oh...

Okay, I'll be right back.

"Unpause. "

Hey, no way,
you'll a 'quitter' now!

Excuse me!

Excuse me, sir!
Hey, dude!

You are awesome, man!
Wow!

Could you take a picture?
We actually have to go.

No, are you kidding? Don't
be silly. He loves this stuff!

Alright, okay.

It's awesome!
Breathe, man, breathe!

That was mean!
It's good for him.

Hey, check it out!

Oh, look at this!

I mean, honestly,
who writes those?

I don't know but I've been
thinking about it.

About what?
About going into commercial advertising.

Seems like a writer could
actually make a living.

Yeah, but...
would you be happy doing that?

I don't know.

But if I don't make enough money
doing what makes me happy...

...then, I'm gonna have to
settle on something, right?.

I'm so serious.
That's not funny!

Erm... I don't mean to bother
you, but would you mind?

Be nice. He is a kid.

That'll be five dollars.

Be nice!
You can't do that...

Sorry, sorry about that.
It's free this time.

Next time, you pay.
Thank you!

So, did you mean what
you said before?

What... at the store?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Maybe.

Look, I just think that it might be time
for me to get a little more serious.

Think about my future instead of
going after this whole 'writing' thing.

But it's your dream.
Yes.

But it's definitely
not my 'reality'.

And I want to have a family
... someday.

So, I think I might need to settle for a
career that is a little more realistic.

You can't quit.

Why?

Besides the fact that I love it.
Why? Give me one good reason.

Because I know you're
going to make it.

Okay, That is
pretty good, but...

Promise me...
you won't give up.

Promise me.
Why are you so sure of me?

Because I know you, Ethan.
You are talented.

And you shouldn't settle. You can
have everything you want out of life.

And I...

I believe in you.

Thank you.

You're my 'Charlie Brown'.

I'm your what now?

When I was a kid, there used
to be these 'Charlie Brown'...

...Specials on TV.
Yeah...

And there was one where Charlie
Brown had a crush...

...on this little girl.
Oh, the redhead girl.

Yes, exactly.
Yeah.

And through the whole cartoon,
he was totally smitten.

And then, finally...
the little girl kissed him.

And suddenly,
Charlie Brown was flying.

And I mean... really flying...
like through the clouds, soaring.

And I just totally
didn't get it.

And so, I asked my mom
what was going on?

And she told me...

"That's exactly how I feel every
time I kiss your father. "

So, naturally, I thought my
dad had some kind of...

...magical kissing power!

That whoever kisses him
gets to feel like they're fine.

Sure...

So, I tried it.

I kissed him...
and I closed my eyes.

And I concentrated really,
really hard.

And absolutely nothing
happened.

Nothing.

I was so bombed.

And I tried it a few more times
and eventually just gave up.

I actually forgot
all about it.

Until the first time
you kissed me.

And then I remembered
Charlie Brown.

Promise me.

I promise... for now.

Hi!
Hi.

What are you doing here?
Well, can't your boyfriend stop by?

Of course, I'm just...
surprised.

Well, I wanted to surprise
you. Come on, grab your coat!

All right.

What are we doing here?
Grab a seat.

"FOR EVERYBODY
WITH A NOSE."

We got it.
You got it?

No, no, we got it. They loved
it! We're launching this fall.

Congratulations!

To you too!
No.

That is your line. I would
have never come up with that.

No, no.
You're smarter than me.

Nobody's denying that.

Did my superior intelligence
just emasculate you?

Because that's bound to happen,
eventually.

There's... more.

Okay.

For a while now, Garrett
and I have been talking about...

...expanding the agency.
Opening another branch.

Well, this kinda put it
over the top for us.

Since I developed the concept "Clear"
wants me to head up the design.

Which I would do at our...
new branch... in Austin.

The one in the middle
of Texas?

That's the one, but it'll probably
for a few months.

Once, we're running smoothly...
Then, you'll move back?

I can commute back and forth.
But I'm gonna be here all the time.

When is this all going to happen?
As soon as I say 'Yes'.

And when will that be?

As soon as you say
you will come with me.

Don't say anything,
Just think about it.

You, me...

Austin...

Some apartment we
try really hard to make hip...

...but it's pathetically unhip.
It will be great!

Wow... I don't know
really what to say...

Well... just think about it,
then.

Take as long as you want but just say
'Yes'. And by tomorrow night, if you can

Run away with me.

When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

It's been known
to have happened.

This is so amazing!
Yeah!

My parents and I used
to hike up here a lot.

Seems like a tough
hike for a kid.

I was a tough kid!

I know you're such a
cute little boy.

You know, when I was in 7th grade,
I brought home a progress report.

Except I was failing
in science.

My mother went ballistic!

And the next day, my dad
brought me up here.

And he told me the reason that they
were so upset was because they know...

...how special I was, and that I
can do whatever I wanted in life...

...if I was just willing
to work for it.

And he really believed it.
He was so sure of me.

Were you not so
sure of 'you'?

What about you? Have you felt
totally sure about yourself?

I think so, yeah.
I mean when I was younger.

But I don't know, divorce has its weird
way of making you realize that...

...you can't really be sure
of anything.

Anything?
Anything.

Come on,
I don't buy that.

Okay, has there ever been
anything that you've been...

...totally sure of?

Okay, I used to think, believe I
was going make it as a writer.

I have become significantly
less sure of that...

But... then I ran into
this girl at the cafe.

Gorgeous...

Funny...

Blonde...
Hey!

I'm kidding... I'm kidding!
That's not nice.

And... I was 'sure' that I wanted
to talk to her.

I wanted to get to
know her.

And the more I got to know her,
the more I became sure...

...that I've never met anyone
like her.

And that everything with her is
better that anything without her.

I'm better with her.

So...

I guess I've never really been sure
about anything except you.

I'm 'sure' about you.

I have fallen in love
with you, Jesse.

I love you too.

And I'm sure that...

I want to spend...

...the rest of my life
with you.

Will you marry me?

Ethan, you are
so amazing.

Amazing enough
to marry?

I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

Was it the speech?

I know the speech was
too much but... Jesse!

I know this is fast,
but I know that it's right.

But I guess it's just not right for you...
It's just...

...a lot about me that
you still don't know.

Okay, so tell me.
All of it and I'll marry you anyway.

There is nothing you can say that
will change how I feel about you.

I can't...

Do you love me?

Really, honestly love me?
I love you so much.

Then, talk to me.
I can't, I can't...

Jesse, I'm not blind. I know
you're not telling me something.

The only thing frustrating about that...
is that you still don't feel like you can!

I can't!
You can't or you won't?!

I can't!

Okay? I can't be who
you want me to be!

Jesse, all I want
is you.

Yes.

Jesse, I don't know
what to do, eh...

Confused...
I am really confused.

And I'm hurt and I don't understand
what happened, so...

I think I'm just going to keep
calling you... leaving messages.

I don't know.
I just... I miss you.

I'm still here.

And I miss you.

Don't.

I didn't say anything.
It's what you're thinking.

What am I thinking?
That I made the wrong choice.

Are you sure that's not
what you're thinking?

I just need to get out of here.
And things will be better.

For you or for him?

You want to know what
I'm really thinking?

Do I have a choice?

I think... that
you are an amazing person.

And you deserve
to be happy.

And I think if you don't tell
Ethan the truth about everything...

You'll never going to be
as happy as you could be.

No matter what happens.

Yeah!

So, you've got it?

Yeah, I've got it!
Is this for real?

Yes! What did I tell you, Ethan?
I've always said you've talent.

But if I had known you
were capable of writing...

...with so much pain!
With so much of thought!

My God, I would have signed
you a long time ago.

Congratulations, but you really
broke through on this one.

Barbara. I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

You go!

Celebrate! You'll be seeing so much
each other that you'll be sick of me.

Okay, thank you.

Jesse!

Oh, please pick up!

Hi, this is Jesse, please
leave a message.

Oh, sorry! Sorry!

Come on,
come on...

Ethan?
David... is she here?

No. She's not.

Look... I know she doesn't want
to see me... but if you just...

Ethan.

She is really
not here.

Okay, can you tell me where she is?
Eh...

David.

I love her.

Please.

She loves you too.

But she's gone.

She already left
for the airport.

The airport?
Ethan, run!

All right. Thanks.

Delta Flight 1182!

Can I help you?

Can I help you, sir?

No, thank you.

I thought you left?

I thought I would.

I have to tell you
something.

I need to tell
you something.

You finished your manuscript?
Yeah.

And...

Ethan, this is amazing.

You did it.

We did it.

What are you talking about?
The day that I met you...

...something happened in me.

You changed me.

And this story...
this is us.

"TROY MEETS GIRL"

My publisher tells me it has
'passion'... and 'heart'...

It's the best thing
I've ever written.

So, how was the writing going?
Pretty well, actually.

I started something new.

Ethan, you need a
leading man.

You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident, and...

...charismatic, and sexy.

Excuse me?

Hi, I called an order for pick-up.
My name is Troy.

But I have a strange feeling that if I
don't make an exception this one time...

I'm really going to
regret it.

On top of everything else, not only will I have to find
some way to strike up another conversation with you...

I will have to come up with some
witty clever remarks so..

...you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

That's what I've been trying to do.
Draw from real life.

Model the character
after my own experience.

That's right...

Oh, promise me you'll not
going to tell anyone about this!

I never make promises that I have
absolutely no intention of keeping.

I'm old fashioned that way.

Until the first time
you kissed me.

Then, I remembered
Charlie Brown.

When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

This guy, Troy...
Yeah?

He is nothing like you.

Well... I had to change that 'coz no one
likes to read a story about a guy like me.

And I changed the ending.

Instead of leaving an envelope
on my doorstep, you showed up...

Said, 'Yes' and we went
away together.

Everybody loves
happy endings.

I eh...
wanted to tell you everything.

And be more...
open with you.

But... I didn't believe
that we can be together.

I mean, really...
really be together.

Like...

Happily ever after
with four kids?

I can't have children.

I just can't.

And that's why my ex-husband
divorced me and eh...

I don't really blame him,
you know... because I...

...couldn't give him
what he deserved, so...

Why didn't you
tell me this?

Because I was terrified.

Jesse, I'm not him.

And that's what
I was scared of.

I mean, I was afraid that
you loved me enough that...

...you would give
that up and...

You know, I felt that if...

...I really loved you, then I
couldnt ask you to give that up.

To sacrifice that for me.

I don't need that.

No.

But you deserve it.

You deserve to be
a father.

And you deserve to be with someone
that can give that to you...

Someone... whole
and complete.

So, I couldn't leave without
telling you all of that.

Where are you going?

I took a job in Portland.

My best friend from High School lives
there and I'm going to live with her.

This story has passion because
I'm passionate about you.

I never could have written
it without you.

Because I have never been this happy
as I am when I'm with you.

Now you tell me that I deserve
someone whole and complete.

I was never whole and complete
until I met you.

I will never be a mother.

Of course you will.

We'll adopt. We can have
as many kids as you want.

I mean, we should
keep trying, though.

We should try a lot.
We should try right now.

On our first date, we were sitting
on that baseball field...

And you said that life doesn't
always turn out the way you expect.

which is right...

but... I think that if you stay...

...and maybe marry me, we can
still have that 'happily ever after'.

Yeah.

Happily ever after? Really?

Trust me, I am a writer...
soon to be published.

Yeah, but Troy... Can't you
come up with a better name?

Everyone is a critic!

How come you
didn't change 'me'?

I couldn't change you.

You're perfect.
