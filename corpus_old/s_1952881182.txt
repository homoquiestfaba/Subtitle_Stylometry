STREET KINGS-2 MOTOR CITY (2011)

Mikey.

[ Snorts ]

[ Inhales ]

Yeah, Mikey likes that.

All right. We got a deal. Let's go.

Three million dollars. Count it, boy.

Yes, sir, massa. That's the way.

Where are the bricks?

We gotta take a drive, homey.

Do I look like Miss Daisy
to you, Bones? Huh?

What's that green-eyed nigger looking at?
All right, Lloyd.

What you looking at?
What's wrong with you, Q-tip?

Huh?
[ Bones ] Now hold on.

Come on. Let's do this.
Hold on, man.

Wait. Hey, yo.

150 kilos
pure Bolivian marching powder right here.

Now we got a party, fellas.

That nigger's got a wire right there!

Metro Police! Narcotics!

Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

[ Sharp Whistle ]
Aah!

You ain't no fucking police!

[ Shouting ]

Turn the shit up!
[ Detective Groans ]

[ Groaning ]
Die, pig!

[ Groans ]

[ Engine Starts, Revs ]
[ Tires Screeching ]

Move and you fucking die!

He's fucking dying! I'm losing him!

[ Groaning ]
Marty!

â™ªâ™ª [ Garage Blues ]

[ Man ]
â™ª Lonely man â™ª

â™ª Lonely am I â™ª

â™ª When you said you was leavin'
you made me cry â™ª

â™ª I want you back, baby,
by my side â™ª

â™ª Dry these tears that's in my eyes â™ª

â™ª Lonely man am I â™ª

â™ª Lonely, lonely man am I â™ª

â™ª It hurt so bad when you made me cry â™ª

[ Vocalizing ]

â™ª Make me happy just once in a while â™ª

â™ª Treat me good, baby â™ª

â™ª Hold me like a child â™ª

â™ª Give it to me, baby â™ª

â™ª Make me smlle â™ªâ™ª

[ Marty ]
Policemen are your friends.

Okay?

Don't be-- Don't be afraid
to come up to us to report a crime.

Okay? I got one more question
before I go back to the dog pound.

Oh, no, no! Not the dog pound.
Go back to the statlon.

Who's got a question? Anybody?
[ Children Shouting ] Me! Me, please!

Eeny, meeny, miny, mo!

[ Children Moan ]
[ Boy ] Why are you limping?

Why am I limping?

Because a long time ago,
a very bad man hurt my paw.

But he's not gonna do it anymore.

[ Children ] Why?
You know why?

[ Louder ]
Why?

Because crime doesn't pay.

How was I?
You were pretty good.

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Um, when do I get to wear the costume?

No, no, no. You gotta earn it.
[ Sighs ]

You don't just let anybody put on the fur.

Takes years of dedicated service
to grow a shiny coat like this.

[ Chuckles ] Okay.
All right.

[ Kissing ]
Love you, Dad.

I love you.
Love you too, man.

â™ªâ™ª [ Electronic Funk ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues, Fades ]

Kingston.

I told you last week.

I don't know anything
about Q doing any dirt.

He was a good cop.

To the living, we owe respect.

To the dead, we owe only the truth.

To the dead, we owe only the truth.

Yeah, that's smart.
Should be. It's Voltaire.

I guess he didn't know
that cops never die.

That's what the badge means.
You should know that, Sergeant.

You're saying you'd lie for him?

I'm saying I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to catch the motherfucker who did this.

My door is always open.

All right.

[ Man Chuckling ]

What's going on, Marty?

See you're making new friends, huh?
Yeah.

[ Chuckling ] Hey, look. I got a lighter
if you wanna burn that shit.

Here. Here, take it.

Hey, look, man.
I'm sorry to hear about Q. All right?

I checked with Corrections.
Shunt's still inside.

Really? Doesn't mean
he can't still pull some strings.

Know what I mean?

I guess we all gotta watch our backs then.

Yeah.

Hey, what's up with Bones?

Nobody's seen his black ass since.

He's probably doing the Farrakhan thing--

running around with his little bow tie,
talking about keeping it positive.

That's funny.
[ Laughing ]

I guess we all have to watch
each others' backs, huh?

Guess so.
[ Exhales ]

All right. Uh, good to see you, Marty.

How's the leg?
It hurts.

Take it slow, Marty.

[ People Chattering ]
[ Phones Ringing ]

You're Dan Sullivan, right?

Yeah.

Yeah. Quintana was my partner.

I'm gonna be working this case with you.

[ Dan ]
He's not even Homicide.

No offense, Lieutenant,
but I know what I'm doing.

Quintana was Marty's partner
for eight years in Narcotics.

Nobody knows him better than Marty.

I understand.
I was in Homicide.

I got more convictions in one year
than you have in your whole lifetime.

I've been here for nine months.
Exactly.

We're looking for a cop killer.
Captain--

Mm-mm. You're working together. Period.

You think you can keep up?

This your car, huh?
Yeah.

Matches your gun.

Glock 17's the most sophisticated
handgun ever made.

Let me see what you have. Let me see it.

Just this.
Right, yeah. I've seen that.

That looks like the piece
that Jesse James used at the O.K. Corral.

Standard issue suits me just fine.

[ Dan ]
Fuckin'-A.

[ Omid ]
Can I help you fellas?

Feels like the friendly type,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

You know this guy?
Never seen him in my life.

Why don't you take another look?

And give it more
than a millisecond this time.

I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Look at the fucking picture.

Like I told you, I don't know him.

Did you ever hear the expression...

''You get more with honey
than you do vinegar''?

Does anybody recognize this guy?

No?

What about you Boy Scouts?
He look familiar?

Look, we know Quintana came here.

You know he came here.
Just tell us what we need to know.

[ Omid ]
We know him very well.

Or knew him, I should say.

You think a cop dying is funny?
Is that what you're saying?

He was no cop. He was a crook.

That's his old partner right there.
Look at him.

He just watched him get buried.

I'd be very careful what you say next.

He came in every month,
demanded we pay tax. Shook us down.

[ Dan ]
Is that true? Are you lying to me?

You could ask the bar owner
at the Eros down the street.

He'll tell you the same story.

Eros?
Eros.

-â™ªâ™ª [ Techno Soul ]
[ Woman ] â™ª Come here, baby â™ª

-â™ª Touch me â™ª
Manager?

What, y'all lost?

No.

You know what? I got this.

â™ª Why don't you touch me? â™ª

Manager will be down shortly.

-â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]
[ Moaning ]

Feel free to pretend like you're
part of this investigation anytime you want.

[ Marty ]
You're pretending just fine.

No disrespect, but your old partner
didn't sound like a choirboy.

[ Cell Phone Rings ]

Hey.
[ Woman On Phone, Indistinct ]

No, I'm not at a club. I mean--

I'm-I'm at a club, but I'm--
I'm investigating a case.

So, what-what's-- What's wrong?

When are you gonna plck up that crlb?

Listen to me.
I will take care of the crib. I promise.

Can we talk about this tonight?
Sure.

I love you.
I love you too.

You're having a kid?
Yeah.

Congratulations. And you love your wife.

Yeah.
Well, we got something in common.

[ Chuckles ] You got kids?
Yeah. Yeah.

The fuck is this?

My apologies.

I thought you guys were taking over
Quintana's paper route.

Where were you last Thursday night?

You think I killed him?
I'm just asking where you were.

Not to say I can't choke a motherfucker
if he get rough with my girls.

You ought to be looking
at the other dude he came in with.

What did he look like?

A big son of a bitch
with a scar over his eye.

You know his name?
Scary Motherfucking Asshole.

So how long did you know Quintana?

Years.

Yeah.
For years.

Was he on the level? You know, was he--

What?
Was he a good cop?

We're all good cops.
Well, not all of us.

Look, did at times--
like anybody on this job--

was there questions about going too far?

Were there questions
about going over the line?

Maybe. Maybe sometimes.

But, also, too, we took down
a lot of fucking scumbags.

Right.

[ Doorbell Rings ]

[ Lock Clicks ]

Hey.
Hi.

[ Car Door Closes ]
You must be Dan.

I'm Beth, Marty's extremely impolite wife.

Sorry we showed up without cailing first.
[ Woman ] Who is it, babe?

[ Marty ]
It's the crib fairy.

This is my new part-partner, Marty,
and his wife, Beth.
Hi.

Hi. It's nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry we just showed up like this.

No, it's--
I overheard Dan and--

Casey, come here. This is our son, Casey.
This is our son, Casey.

He's not using his crib anymore...

so, if you guys wanted to have it, it's--
You could have it.

[ Laughing ] That's, um--
That's nice.

Wow. That's really nice.
Are you sure you're okay with this?

Oh, yeah. I stopped using it last week.

[ All Laugh ]
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

Um, are you guys in a rush?

'Cause we just cooked dinner,
if you wanna stick around.

No.
Are you sure? We would love that.

[ Marty ] This is delicious.
The best rice I ever had.
[ Beth ] It's so good.

[ Laughing ]
Thank you.

No, it's really good.
It's really good.

Thank you.
Try some of the chicken. It's pretty good.

And these plates, they're beautiful.
Are they from, um, Lebanon?

Mexico. Right?

Yeah. It was just one of those impulse buys
when we were on vacation in Oaxaca.

Oaxaca?
Mm-hmm.

We know Oaxaca well.
Really?

Were you there on vacation as well?

Not really. Um--

Let's just say the doctors
pretty much saved my life--

When, um-- When are you due?

Four months.
Know what you're having?

Boy, girl? Mix? Twins?
[ Dan ] It's a boy.

It's a boy.
Did you pick out a name?

It's Lawrence, after my father.

[ Marty Laughing ]

You got a great woman there, kid.

Take it from someone
who's been married to one for 21 years.

You take care of her above all else.

Above being a cop, anything.
Family comes first.

Here's yours.
Thanks.

All right. What do we got going on over here?
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

Uh, Leilah put that up, and it's cheesy.

No it's not.
It is. It's embarrassing.

No!

Did you play college ball
or just Little League?

You want a-- [ Clicks Tongue ]
Yeah.

Um, almost played college.

I had a few offers and was committed
to Wisconsin when my dad died.

Really? My dad died, too, when I was nine.

I know how tough it could be.

Here you go. To dads.

Was he a cop?

Yeah.

He was murdered
during a simple traffic stop.

They never found the guy.

You want another?
Yeah.

I just don't want
another young widow and her son...

to have to hear
that their loved one died...

and we're sorry,
but we couldn't solve the case...

so here's a flag and a 21 -gun salute
instead of a father.

That's why I became a cop
instead of a ballplayer.

You gotta do whatever you gotta do
to make things right.

â™ªâ™ª [ R&B ]

â™ªâ™ª [ R&B ]

â™ªâ™ª [ Man Vocalizing ]

It's too early to tell. I'm just--

What's going on with Q's?
You see anything? You find anything?

-â™ªâ™ª [ Continues ]
Other than booze, crack pipes
and bookie slips? No.

All right. Keep in touch.
Yeah.

â™ª I've been workin'â™ª

â™ª Every day â™ª

â™ª But I keeps my baby â™ª

â™ª Keeps her on my mind â™ª

â™ª She's my baby â™ª

â™ª She's my lady â™ª

â™ª She the only one for me â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

-â™ªâ™ª [ Stops ]
[ Door Opens ]

Just what the fuck are you doing?
Hey, out! Out, out!

Right now! Police business.

You got a warrant?
Yes, I do.

Now get the fuck out
before I have to take you in.

For what?

For what? For trespassing, obstruction,
tampering-- whatever.

This is my building.

[ Laughs ]
All right.

You're investigating the Quintana murder.
So why are you talking to Fowler?

You get a hard-on
every time two cops talk?

I guess you I.A. guys
have nothing better to do.

Oh, yeah. Nothing better to do
than to catch crooked cops.
[ Scoffs ]

What do you want?
What do you want to tell me?

Well, what I want to tell you
involves a lot of four-letter words...

but it'll get me into trouble.

Then keep your mouth shut and know this.

I've been looking into Quintana
for a couple of months...

and now I got a lead on Fowler
and his partner, Jimmy Rogan.

So if you learn anything about them...

I suggest you tell me
before I talk to them Thursday.

I help you. You help me.

All right?

All right.

Name?
Clark.

-â™ª And the raln came down â™ª
Clark. From I.A.

Likes the fucking Lions.

â™ª Raln came down â™ª

[ Tires Screeching ]

[ Engine Revving ]

-â™ªâ™ª [ Continues, Indistinct ]
You sent Sullivan to question me?

Am I under investigation?
That I didn't do. What did he do?

You're fucking lying.
Somebody's fuckin' lyin'.

I'm on your fucking team, Marty.
I know, and I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

You better fix it. You better go after
those motherfuckers and fix it.

Fix it, goddamn it!

I'm not going down alone, Marty!
-â™ª Slx cold feet â™ª

â™ª Slx cold feet down â™ª

[ Tires Screeching ]

[ Marty ] Hey, I hear you're becoming
bosom buddies with Fowler.

Oh, yeah. Might even Facebook him.

What does he have to do with this?

You heard the strip club manager.

There was a big guy
with a scar over his eye.

All right, so he matches the description.

And so does half the starting lineup
for the Pistons.

None of them paid Quintana's rent
a few weeks ago, like Fowler did.

Why did he lie to me
about not having seen Quintana in a while?

I'm not gonna tell you
how to do your job...

but I think you're going
in the wrong direction here.

Most likely,
Fowler was working undercover with Q.

Course he's gonna deny being with him.
He's not gonna trust you.

You gotta be smart.

Fowler is not gonna react well
to being treated like a fucking suspect.

[ Dan ]
Like I care about his feelings.

[ Marty ]
Or maybe Fowler borrowed money from Q.

Maybe he's just a nice guy
and wanted to help him with the rent.

I.A. doesn't investigate nice guys.

What'd you say?
What are you talking about-- I.A.?

Clark from I.A. has got a file on Fowler
and his partner, Rogan.

No shit? He showed it to you?

No.

All I know is I.A.'s been
watching them and Quintana.

What do they have on them?
I don't know.

Clark's meeting with them tomorrow.

Well.

Maybe you're onto something here, kid.

What you got for me, mama-san?

[ Sighs ] Please.
You know, you wear condom this time.

What the fuck is you talking about?

You want me to shut
this motherfucker down?

Give me your best girl.
I got a lot of fluids to release.

Me so horny.

Me so horny.

Hey, look here, mama-san.
Make sure her pooper's clean.

'Cause you know, bad-ass niggers like me
got dicks forked like a snake's tongue.

I poke two holes at once, baby.

Okay, okay.
[ Chuckling ]

You big man, yeah.
Come on, baby. Me love you long time.

[ Madam Sighs, Mutters In Asian Language ]

I like that.

That's it. That's it.

[ Man Moaning ]

[ Woman Gasps ]

He's got a gun!

[ People Shouting, Screaming ]

Oh, shit!

No! No!
[ Groans ]

[ Female Dispatcher ]
All units.

Coroner's requesting a police escort
for Detective Fowler's body.

All units respond.

[ Rogan ]
Baby, where are you?

We gotta get out of here.
Fowler's dead. Call me!

[ Panting ]

[ Softly ]
Come on.

[ Glass Shatters ]

Yeah.

[ Grunts ]

[ Groaning, Grunting ]

[ Groans ]
Fuck!

Marty?

[ Neck Snaps ]

[ Chattering ]

[ Chattering ]

I don't care if every other
piece of shit runs free.

I want everyone in Homicide
working this case.

Kingston.

Gotcha.

How many cameras
do you have around the marina?

There's one other, but the seagulls
keep shitting on the lens...

so it probably won't help.

Any witnesses?
No, nobody saw a thing.

Uh, what have you got here?

Eye in the sky--
sits 40 feet from the crime scene.

Oh, perfect.
Well, we'll see if it's perfect.

You can go ahead and play.

[ Dan Sniffles, Murmurs ]

[ Dan ]
Bingo. We got him here.

He's got a-- a hood.

Can-Can you, uh-- Can you slow it down?

Sure can. How's that?

It's good. It's good. It's-- It's--

Is there any chance you can zoom in?

[ Security Guard ]
Zooming in and--

[ Typing ]
There's your zoom.

[ Dan ]
We can almost make out his face.

[ Exhales ]

What's with the bruise?

You can see a bruise?

Not on the perp.
On-- [ Chuckles ] you.

[ Chuckling ]
Oh. Oh.

I thought-- Uh--

I was pitching to Casey last night...

and, uh, he wanted
to use the aluminum bat and a hard ball.

And, uh, he got me good.

He's getting strong. He got me good.

[ Security Guard ]
How about this?

That's better, but can you
rotate it 90 degrees?

That would give us a perfect shot.
Sure--

if this was Homeland Security.

I'm sorry, but this is as good as it gets.

Okay. Well, thank you.
Can you burn it to CD?

I'm gonna run it through our lab.

Sure can.
Yeah?

[ Marty Groans ]
I appreciate it.

Rogan knew he was being targeted.

He was trying to get the fuck out of here.
Didn't look like he was coming back.

What makes you say that?
He had enough food and guns for an army.

Got three dead cops-- all killed
before they talked to I.A.

Something bigger going on here.

Here it is. It's all there.

You know what? The lab guy
owes me a favor. I'll get this done real quick.

You go give the wife the bad news.

[ Door Clatters ]

[ Whimpering ] Hey. Hey, come get me
the fuck out this chair, man.

[ Crying, Whimpering ]
This motherfucker crazy, dog.

Come get me the fuck out this chair,
man, before he come back!

This motherfucker's crazy, dog.
Just help me out. Just help me out!

Shit! Come help me out, man!

This fucking rope, man.
Take this shit off me.

[ Crying, Sniffling ]

Man, what the fuck, man?

[ Crying ]
I ain't do shit to you, man!

[ Softly Shushing ]

[ Gasps ]

I don't want
another fucking cigarette, man.

I need a fucking hit.
It's been three days!

Get me the fuck--
[ Shushing ]

I didn't do shit.

I ain't do shit to you, dog.
[ Shushing ]

[ Sniffles ]
Shh.

What you doing?

What the fuck?

What the fu--

What the fuck? Fuck you!

[ Clicking ]

Fuck you! You fucking dead!

I know all the cops round this bitch!

You hear me?

-â™ªâ™ª [ Rock ]
[ Groans ]

Good luck, Bones.

[ Man ]

[ Man ]
â™ª I know a man who is a thief â™ª

[ Chorus ]
â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª He steals everything

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Don't you know he-- â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, well, he-- â™ª

â™ª He's got five klds
who got to eat â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª He's livin' in poverty â™ª

â™ª Well â™ª

â™ª It's such a pity to see â™ª

â™ª And I want you to know â™ª

â™ª That it ain't nothin'
but the lowdown truth â™ª

â™ª Well, people, let me tell you â™ª

â™ª It don't mean a thing to me â™ª

â™ª But I want you to know â™ª

â™ª I, I, I â™ª

â™ª I want you to know, yeah â™ª

â™ª Why it don't mean a thing to me â™ª

â™ª Not to me, now â™ª

â™ª I know a girl who is a ho
Yes, I do â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [ Continues, Indistinct ]

[ Gun Cocks ]
Move and I'll blow your brains out.

Easy.

Mrs.-- Mrs. Rogan, I--

My name is Detective Dan Sullivan.

I-I'm here to ask you some questions
about your husband.

Bullshit!

The cops were already here
to tell me that he died. Now who sent you?

I'm the detective
assigned to the case, okay?

Just-- Just put the gun down.

Please just put the gun down.

Let me see your shield.

Use two fingers to grab it, or I'll be
wiping your brains off the window.

I'll meet you at the front door.

Did he have enemies?

He worked Narcotics. What do you think?

Did he say anything out of the ordinary?

Everything was
out of the ordinary with Jimmy.

Were there any threats recently?

Nothing unusual.

Anybody with an old grudge or--

Detective Sullivan,
you seem like a nice guy.

Good luck.

You know something.

You know something.

If you know something, please tell me.

Mrs. Rogan, we can protect you
a lot better than dead bolts...

wrought iron doors and a handgun.

Like you protected Jimmy?

I'm done.
Somebody was chasing him?

I said I'm done.

[ Groans ]

[ Groaning ]
You fucker!

Fuck!

Between the devil and the deep

Of promises I could not keep

Hey. Make it a double, Johnny.

With a heart that never beat

[ Exhales ]

Thanks.
â™ªâ™ª [ Continues, Indistinct ]

She's holding something back.
I should've pressured her more.

You're thinking too much.

Her husband was just killed.
His partner was killed.

I.A.'s sniffing around.

I wouldn't worry so much about her.

Yeah.

The lab get back to you about that video?

[ Exhales ]

There's nothing
that they could, uh, do with it.

They couldn't tell if the hooded figure
was a Klansman or Little Red Riding Hood.

Great.

We just keep going. We stay the course.

Where are we going with this, Marty?

What? What do you mean?

Maybe they deserved it.

Maybe. We're still gonna fry
the motherfucker who did this.

Our job stays the same.

Every lead in this case
circles back to Narcotics-- every single one.

So?
What if--

What if our killer is a cop?

He's not.

[ Cell Phone Ringing ]

Sullivan.

[ Man ] It's the lab. We've got some stuff
down here you need to see.

We'll be right there.

What?
We gotta go. We gotta go.

We lifted this from a cigarette
we found at the rub-and-tug...

and this from a cigarette
we found at Rogan's boat.

Same brand of cigarettes,
same guy at both places.

What's this fucker's name?
Trevon Richardson-- a.k.a. Bones.

[ Helicopter Whirring Overhead ]

Move! Move!
[ Explosion ]

Go! Go! Go!

Move in! Move in!

Watch your sixes.

[ Man On Radio ]
Charlie team, secure the basement.

[ Man ]

Blue team, get around the perlmeter.

This is Charlie team. Basement is secure.

Kingston!

Look out!

Keep Tac 2 open. Keep the line open.

[ Man ]
Watch that door!

[ Man ]
Are we clear?

Green team, clear and hold.

[ Men Chattering ]

[ Man ]
Clear.

We're clear.
West floor clear.

[ Dan ] Nothing.

He's here.

Dan! Dan!

L.P.D., we're clear over here.

[ Woman ] Get it off of me!

Get off!
What's happening?

[ Screaming, Shouting ]

It's over.

[ Woman Gasping, Crying ]

I'm not moving. Nobody's moving, okay?

None of us are moving. Look at this.

This is Detective Sullivan.

You instruct them
to stop the train right now.

You hear me?
[ Female Dispatcher ] Copy that.

Why the fuck you do that? Hmm?

Why the fuck you do that?
So we can talk.

Okay? We need to talk.

Please let me go.
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

Shut the fuck up! You shut up!

You think I'm stupid, motherfucker?
Like I'm-a believe this shit?

You stop the train
so these helicopters shoot me down!

There's no helicopters, man.
That's why you stoppin' the train!

So you can get a better shot!
Hey. Whoa. Easy!

Fuck you! You're gonna shoot me!
Easy, man!

Look at me! You look at me!
You leave her out of this!

You leave her out of this!
You don't need that problem.

You think I'm dumb?

You got three dead cops on your hands.

What you talkin' about?
I ain't killed nobody!

I ain't killed no cops!

I've been gone the past few fucking days.

This crazy-ass motherfucker kidnapped me.

Some garlic-stinking place, dog.
I've been gone.

I swear to God, it was like
some Hannibal Lecter-type shit.

He had me tied up for three days...

put a gun in my hand and tried to shoot me.
Stop it!

You killed those cops!
You killed those cops!

I'm not lying!
Then why are you running?

You fucking shoot me, you dead!

You fucking shoot me, you dead,
you punk-ass cop!

Detective.

Mrs. Rogan.

Hey-- Take-Take him away.

I'm cooking dinner here,
and he just wants to yap.

All right.
[ Laughs ]

I got a few pointers with the kick flip
that you were-- I used to be a skater.

You should actually--
You should've seen me on a half-pipe.

I used to have a half-pipe. I have tons
of pictures. Do you wanna see them?

Yeah.
They're inside the house. Come on.

Here it is.
It's just on my grandpa's farm.

You can tell it's getting kind of old.

And here's another one.

I don't use it anymore, 'cause the whole place
reeks of garlic, and I hate garlic.

Casey! Dan!

Come on, let's go. It's ready.

I ain't even been here
the last two days, man.

This crazy-ass motherfucker kidnapped me
to some garlic-stlnkin' place, man.

I swear to God,
It was some Hannibal Lecter--

This crazy-ass motherfucker kidnapped me
to some garlic-stlnkin' place, man.

I swear to God--

Thank you.

So, uh, I just wanted to ask you...

a few questions about Lieutenant Kingston.

I don't like him. Simple as that.

Um, I'm gonna just--

Uh, he was Jimmy's superior.

In rank only.

But that's not why
I don't give a rat's ass about him.

Ever since the White Alliance bust,
he acted like his shit didn't stink.

Jimmy said he copped an attitude,
wasn't one of the guys anymore.

White Alliance?

A biker gang moved here from L.A.
and started dealing.

Right.

Yeah, I never-- I never saw
anything about that in your husband's file.

Of course you wouldn't.
They were working deep undercover.

Who's ''they''?

Jimmy, Tyrone and Quintana and Marty.

They were all using aliases,
even in the department files...

since the Alliance bought off cops.

That piece of shit that you killed
was working for them, right?

Why do you say that?

Why else would he kill
all the cops who busted the Alliance?

[ Beeps ]

[ Man ] I was making over six figures
a week in Southern Cal...

even with the spics moving in.

So I thought I'd move to God's country,
stake a cIaim for myself where I belong.

Your mother must be very proud.

I paid my bills.

Niggers around here
can't get their kids diapers or milk...

but somehow they can
always afford to load up the pipe.

I wanna hear about the bust.

I trusted Tommy--
Marty, whatever the fuck his name was.

Thought he was one of us.

Instead, he betrayed his race.

And he and his motherfuckin',
bitch-ass, no-honor cops stole my money.

I had over three million in cash
before they jacked me.

Two million according to court transcripts.
Two million.

Exactly.

You tell anybody?

Oh, I told everybody. Who'd believe me?

Right.

You know I'm telling the truth.

What makes you say that?

Because you're still sitting here.

Sergeant Clark?

You mind if I sit-- sit here?

You're a little late
if you want to play nice.

[ Scoffs ]
What?

Our I.A. file on Quintana,
Fowler and Rogan is officially closed.

You were investigating them
for shaking down a nightclub?

Owned by Mayor Schiffman's son.
Not a brilliant move.

This has nothing to do
with the White Alliance drug bust?

What?

Who else has seen this?
Just you and me.

Being the mayor's kid,
I had to keep it quiet.

But your partner
sure was curious to read it.

Did he see it?
No.

His name wasn't on the clearance.

Here in I.A., we actually follow the law.

Hey.
[ Man ] Detective, It's the lab.

Anything?
Nah.

Me neither.

It all checks out.

Nothing unusual.

Thanks.

Do you want me to send over
this Westlaw report?

It's just some lawsuit
against an lnsurance company.

Uh, Accounts Receivable, por favor.

Yes, how can I help you, sir?

You speak English.
I really appreciate that. Um--

My wife, Beth Kingston, was a patient,
and I'm looking for a copy of the receipt.

What is her date of birth?

4-20-66.

Please hold.

You have a zero balance, sir.

Right.

What credit card did I use?

You pald the entlre balance in cash.

$212,405. 18.

Hey! I help you solve
the biggest case of your career...

you don't fucking take my calls?

Yeah, I was at the doctor's with Leilah.

I had to be there,
so I was unavailable for most of the--

Everything okay?

Yeah.

I have a fucking virus.

All my files are corrupt.

[ Exhales ]
What are you doing here?

I forgot something.

Are you sure you're okay?

No.

Actually, no.

What is it?

The truth--

It's just, like, the other day that--

It's just building up,
and it's really starting to get to me.

First time you kill someone
is never easy.

No, it isn't.

You did the right thing.

He was guilty.

I know.

Why don't you go home and get some rest?

You gotta look out for you
and your family first. I told you that.

Yeah, that's, uh-- That's a good idea.

That's what I'm gonna do.

Good idea.

I'll walk you out.

The only thing
that you should be thinking about...

is where you're gonna display
the commendation.

[ Chuckles ]

Yeah.

I'll have Property bring the jacket over.
We should know by morning.

Great. Maybe we'll have
better luck with this...

than we did with that
marina surveillance video.

What surveillance video?

The one from Jimmy Rogan's murder.

We never saw it.

Ah. There you go. Come on.
[ Laughing ]

[ Marty ]
That's it.

Okay.

Hey, baby.

Marty was just showing me
a relaxation pose.

Did it with my wife when she was pregnant.
It worked wonders.

Hello.
I think we'll be fine.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I think we'll be all right.
Oh.

Are you all right?
Marty said you weren't feeling so good.

Yeah. I came by to check up on you.

I'm fine.
Okay.

Do you mind? Um, 'cause--

No, no. Not at all. I understand.

I'll let you two lovebirds be alone.

Sometimes cases stick with you.

They take you to places
you don't want to go.

For your own good, Dan, leave it alone.

You just enjoy your time with your wife.

Is that a threat?

I'm telling you, just leave it alone.

Don't twist this on me, Marty.

I took money from a criminal--

a lowlife hate-spewing drug dealer--
one time...

to pay for my wife's cancer surgery
down in Mexico.

The insurance company
was gonna let her die.

You think I was gonna let that happen?

I did it one time.

But not my fellow cops.
They couldn't stop.

Those greedy motherfuckers forced my hand.

They kept taking and taking and taking.

I.A. was closing in.
What am I supposed to do?

I.A. was investigating them
for shaking down a nightclub.

They didn't know anything
about White Alliance or any fucking money.

Just leave it alone.

[ Sighs ]

Honey?

Shh, shh, shh.

No, I didn't-- I didn't mean to wake you.

You coming to bed, or what?

No. Shh, shh.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.

I didn't mean to wake you up.
Mmm.

You okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.

What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

It's the middle of the night.
What do you mean, ''nothing''?

What?

What would you do to protect our family?

Shh. Huh?

I don't know.

Anything.
Anything?

Mm-hmm.

What if bad guys had to die
in order for me to survive?

Mmm...

then...

I'd kill 'em all.

Love you.

I can leave it on your desk.

Don't worry about it.

What? I-- I don't understand.

I'll explain it when I get there.

Just-Just-- Just forget about it.
