             (girl)
          High school.

    If you believe the hype,

    it will be the greatest
      years of our lives.

       Oh, that's not me,
          by the way.

          That's me...
        with my brother.

 And what you're about to watch

 is actually about my first day
       in seventh grade.

                 <i> Are you ready,</i>
                 <i> guys?</i>

             <i> (all)</i>
        <i> Totally ready!</i>

               â™ªâ™ª

 â™ª This time is so fantastic â™ª

     â™ª And we're psyched to
        get scholastic â™ª

     â™ª 'Cause it's day one
      of the school year â™ª

     â™ª I got the right guy
  and my friends by my side â™ª

  â™ª I got my pom-poms and made
          it a cheer â™ª

          â™ª Let's go â™ª

           <i> â™ª And I'm</i>
   <i> the class president... â™ª</i>

CJ, shut this off.

                      Stop.

  <i> â™ª ... having 500 friends â™ª</i>

           <i> â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

   â™ª And every one in Glee â™ª

         â™ª Is so proud
       and so friendly â™ª

            â™ª Hey â™ª

   â™ª 'Cause it's high school
       the cool school â™ª

 â™ª The totally-we-rule school â™ª

       â™ª The yeah school
       the whoo school â™ª

  <i> â™ª The shake-it-like-a-fool</i>
           <i> school â™ª</i>

      <i> â™ª Where friendship</i>
         <i> never ends â™ªâ™ª</i>

Okay, high school
is nothing like that.

Trust me.

                 They're a bunch
                 of liars.

               Ronbie,
               please don't ruin

     "High School High Musical."

               And my last night
               of summer.

             <i> (all)</i>
 <i> Yeah, don't ruin it for her.</i>

   Okay, here's where things
      get a little weird.

       But stay with me,
      it will make sense.

Well, don't lie to her!

Sing what high school's
really like.

Go on, go on.

Sing her
the truth.

   Sing it!

       <i> â™ª Your brother's</i>
        <i> kind of right â™ª</i>

  <i> â™ª High school's a struggle</i>
         <i> and a fight â™ª</i>

     <i> â™ª I'm overscheduled and</i>
     <i> have no time for friends â™ª</i>

           <i> â™ª What? â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Because I got five Fs they</i>
<i> took the letter off my chest â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª And now my season's</i>
<i> at an end â™ª</i>

                  <i> Ahh!</i>

            â™ª And we
       didn't make Glee â™ª

         â™ª So we're sad
          not happy â™ª

   Sorry, guys.

 Now off my stage!

                   (yelling)

           (crashing)

                  It gets worse?

   Oh yeah.

     School starts at 7:30.

       I have five hours
      of homework a night.

      Final exams make me
         <i> wanna</i> vomit.

       â™ª And you lose all
   the friends you have now â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you grow apart and like
       different things â™ª

     â™ª Or they start to act
  like they're way too cool â™ª

               Can we at least
               sing happy again?

             (all)
             Yeah!

    â™ª 'Cause in high school
       the song school â™ª

 â™ª The homework-all-night-long
            school â™ª

        â™ª The low school
      the strife school â™ª

    â™ª The no-time-for-a-life
            school â™ª

     â™ª And yeah you'll lose
  the friends you have now â™ªâ™ª

        (alarm beeping)
           (gasping)

              Yep,
        you guessed it.

   That last part was a dream
     and I'm freaking out.

              Why?

   Because singing teens just
          informed me

           my future
    is bleak and friendless.

               â™ªâ™ª

    Hey, hon?

Think there's something
wrong with CJ.

                      Oh.

             Of course there is.

  Summer's over and someone told
  her high school horror stories

                     last night.

   Hey, I told her the truth.

And what was that?

    That high school's gross
      and makes you vomit

     and I'm gonna lose all
  the friends that I have now.

Why, you little--
               Get him!

 So you might be wondering why
    I'm so freaked out about

  a silly dream and something
     that's two years away.

       But my friends are
the most important thing to me.

And losing them was all I could
          think about.

  Not what a perfect first day
  of seventh grade it seemed.

     Not our new principal,
who seems to float with terror.

  Not even that Paul Shmalter,
       the hall monitor,

        grew a moustache
        over the summer.

              No.

  All I could think about was,

  will I lose my best friends
      before high school?

        Happy first day,
      best friend of mine.

        Fenwick Fraser,

  possessor of one mega brain,

        100 stylish ties

      and the first friend
          I ever made.

              It's a piggy bank.

You're gonna need it.

With skyrocketing
college tuition,

you'll graduate in deep debt,

yet unemployable because
your parents smothered you

with their crippling sense
of entitlement.

           You wanna be friends?

    Yes.

        And since then,
   he's always there for me.

I can't
hang out anymore.
                      What?

Look, if I want to
go to Stanford

and rule the world someday,

I need to focus now on
scholarships, not friendships.

         Well, what about lunch?

    Studying.

          What about study hall?

   Studying.

             Well, what about...

See you at graduation!

       Okay, I admit it.

  It did seem like I just lost
     best friend number one

        before homeroom.

     But I also knew I had
        BFF number two,

 Christian Powers, AKA Crispo,

          who just got
        his braces off,

    finally got the haircut
          I suggested

       and, after saving
   his life in kindergarten,

   vowed to be my best friend
            forever.

     (school bell ringing)

Now that I got my
braces off,

I can't stop
licking my teeth.

                Okay, stop that.

          Just smile and help me
          figure out a way to

            knock some
            sense back into Fen.

          Hey, Crispo!

   Her Highness, Mindy Minus,

        the most popular
        girl in school.

          I hate her.

         Wow, you look
           different.

Yeah, I got this new hair

and this awesome
jacket that's awesome.

          Yeah, you're
      friends with us now.

               â™ªâ™ª

    Right now, it does seem
      my high school dream

          was becoming
   a middle school nightmare.

     I just lost Fenwick to
          Study World

           and Crispo
       to Popular World.

        But did I panic?

              Yes.

But I knew I just needed to find
 something that would bring us

          all back to
   Best Friend Forever World.

           But what?

           (chirping)

Guess who ate my
rhubarb experiments

in the school garden
all summer

but is not
eating them anymore!

           Why do you
           have it on your desk?

So we can suffer the same
pain and humiliation

that he caused me.

And that's when I realized I was
  going to get my best friends

        back by freeing
     Mr. Slinko's raccoon.

              Why?

      Because I knew since
          kindergarten

     my best buds could not
 resist a good rescue mission.

     Teacher took Angelica.

        But we're gonna
         get her back.

            Lookout!
                    Looking out.

             Rope?

    Horsey!

           No, rope!

    Horsey!

                  We don't
                  need a horsey.

         Don't eat it.

      Besides, who's gonna
      say no to this face?

You can
sit down now.

               â™ªâ™ª

             Do not disturb
             Smart Time, please.

I need your help.
                   Here we go.

I'm just going to
tell you what it is.

       Fine, but whatever it is
       better be important,

          like really important.

       Like "make my face freeze
       so I don't even know

        how to react" important.

We're going to free
Slinko's raccoon.

     (school bell ringing)

               Look, in case you
               haven't noticed,

                we have
                a new principal,

          and getting in trouble
          on our first day

           is not on my
           list of things to do.

               â™ªâ™ª

                      I'm in.
     Great.

Now we just need--

             (all)
            Crispo!

               â™ªâ™ª

   (boy)
   Crispo!

                    (girl)
                    Crispo!

  (boy)
  Crispo!
                     (boy)
                     Crispo!

           Hey, guys.

         Did you hear?
        I'm popular now.

       It's so much fun.

Crispo!
   (boy)
   Crispo!

  (boy)
  Crispo!
    (girl)
    Crispo!

      Put your hand down.

        'Cause you know
       what else is fun?

           Low fives.

Crispo!
   (girl)
   Crispo!

Crispo!

    Saving the caged raccoon
     in Mr. Slinko's class.

        He looks so sad.

      I got just the thing
      to get the job done.

     (thundering)
          (animal growling)

                     Here we go.

               â™ªâ™ª

      The coast is clear.

Operation: Stay Friends Forever
     is going super smooth.

  By the end of second period,
   we were all back together.

   I even made a new friend.

           Okay, we just have to
           get you on our cart,

    disguise you as our
    secret science fair project,

           then roll you outside
           to freedom.

Um, raccoons
don't speak English.

                    Just get him
                    on the cart.

           (chirping)

  Hey, you.

Don't hide those eyes.
      (record scratching)

                       Uh...

          Hey, Mindy,
           what's up?

Crispo's cool cred,
thanks to me.

               â™ªâ™ª

  And just like that, the plan
     started falling apart.

The plan
is falling apart!

       I just said that.

We lost our lookout!

                 The coast
                 is still clear.

          Oh my gosh.

Still clear.

                Ooh, he's heavy.

           (chirping)

        (glass breaking)

      Get you on the cart.

           (clunking)

              (CJ)
         A little help!

I told you this would
only lead to trouble.

And I can't
have trouble!

             There's no trouble.

                    Do you see
                    any trouble?

     (school bell ringing)

         (door closing)

               â™ªâ™ª

        (bird squawking)

    Huh.

            (woman)
       Well, well, well.

  Cutting your first class on
    the first day of school?

      What do you have to
      say for yourselves?

This is all
her fault!

â™ªâ™ª

          Names, now.

                 Uh, names?
   What are names?

    I'm so--
             I don't know what--

I don't understand.

             CJ Martin
             and Fenwick Fraser,

         who must've gotten lost
         on their way to class.

I don't
trust their faces.

I can read faces,
it's a gift.

                  He's right.
    We're so lost.

                  We are so lost
                  and so sorry.
    Where are we?

Your new "princiaplness."
       Your new "princiaplness."

The bow is nice.

I like the bow.

   Students, meet the new leader
   of Pootatuck Middle School,

                Principal Hader.

But perhaps you should
call me Principal Changer

due to all the changes
I'm making to old PMS.

New floors, new ceilings

and a brand-new
administration facility.

             You mean new
             principal's office.

No, it's an
administration facility.

            Principal's office.
It's an
administration facility.

But it's mostly
a principal's--

      Allow me to explain.

  Our school has always had an
  amazing eighth grade patio.

    Eighth graders loved it.

And us seventh graders couldn't
        wait to get it.

  But this year... it's gone.

     And in its place is a
 construction site nicknamed...

             (all)
        The Death Star.

The board wanted me
to have it!

All I want is for
everyone's first day back

to be so great
you chant my name.

      (children chanting)
     Hader, Hader, Hader...

                 Us too.

      Good!

                  I can think of

        100 things you could say
        to me right now

before you... walk...

That's cool.

Catch you later,
my...

                   my BFF!

    Hey!

Where's my cart?

               â™ªâ™ª

     (school bell ringing)

             Are you aware that
             Henry Slinko

              has a raccoon
              in his classroom?

It's in a cage!
What's your point?

         Uh, I guess it would be
         that a feral raccoon

               in school is bad.

Hmm,
here's what's bad.

This school's test scores.

Parents who forget
to sign their

child's
gym release form.

And my new administration
facility,

which is not done yet!

        (truck beeping)

        Well, I don't know,
        I think the Death Star's

            coming along nicely.

Do I threaten you,
Mr. Roberts?

A woman boss
about the same age?

Wait, who calls this
the Death Star?

           The same ones that
           call you Darth Hader.

   (gasping)

I will bring order to
this school, I assure you.
         (truck beeping)

And get that beeping
thing away from me!

If anything
happens to my office,

I don't have the funds
to replace it.

        (truck beeping)

  And you.

Your job is to
guide students, not me,

so go... guide them.

You know
where the door is.

                   I'll just use
                   the wall.

               â™ªâ™ª

              (CJ)
 So next period, as the entire
   eighth grade gave up hope

           of saving
     their beloved patio..

         (all gasping)

   ... I did not give up hope
    on saving my friendships

    or saving that raccoon.

           (chirping)

      No.

         And yes,
         I'm prone to adventure,

           but your plans always
           lead to trouble.

      What?

   Name three.

           The Pudding Incident,
           the Glasgow Fiasco,

                    Ice Hallway.

Okay, good memory.

But I can think of a hundred
reasons why we should--

                  Besides,
                  Crispo's gone.

        Her Highness Mindy Minus
        has pulled him into

            the gorgeous vortex.

             (boy)
            Crispo!

               â™ªâ™ª

           (giggling)

            It is a cool jacket.

I picked out
that jacket!

               â™ªâ™ª

            Oh no, she's coming!

                  Don't look
                  into her eyes.

  Whatever you guys are up to
          sounds weird

      and I don't like it.

 Crispo is going to be the most
   popular boy in the school

   and even though he doesn't
   know it yet, we're dating.

That's not dating.

       Our love is real!

     So stay away from him
   or I will come down on you

     like Paul Shmalter on
         sixth graders.

               â™ªâ™ª

        (siren blaring)

     (chuckling menacingly)

How many things
have to go wrong

before you realize your
plan is dangerous?

                   I don't know,
                   nine?

            (Crispo)
       This book is good.

          Boy, I sure
          like books.

    Crispo?
                     Crispo?

         Keep talking,
    but look at Fen, not me.

              Uh, okay, but why
              are we doing this?

   Meet me at the first floor
         water fountain

             if you
       want to know more.

Do we have to go?

Keep talking.

        (Crispo)
        Look, Mindy told me that
        I had to choose between

               you guys and her.

                 But I don't
                 want to choose.

                I love you guys.

                     But Mindy's
                     so pretty.

                  So I'm hiding
                  behind a book.

Okay, but...

there's a raccoon trapped in
a cage that needs our help.

So what are we
gonna do about it?

 Go back to my intense studies
    and stay out of trouble.

              Mindy smells
              like strawberries.

So would the raccoon
if it wore lip gloss.

And what if it has a raccoon
wife and raccoon kids

and they're all scared

'cause Dad didn't come home
from his raccoon job?

       What else you got?

This is middle school.

This is our time to
get crazy and live life.

I've seen the future

and nobody has time
for anything.

So what
do you say?

One last adventure.

If it doesn't work out,
you can go back to your

intense studies and you
can go back to stra--

       Fine, I'll do it.

                 You had me at
                 "raccoon kids."

     (school bell ringing)

   Okay, so science class was
    pretty straightforward.

  Slinko gave us the standard

   "What do you remember from
       last year?" test.

    Crispo used the time to
invent secret hand code signals

  that we did not understand.

         Mark Chernoff
      completely failed at

the cover-your-fart-with-a-cough
             move.

           (farting)

           (coughing)

     (school bell ringing)

       Then the bell rang
 and we get back to our story.

           (chirping)

He's been taunting me
for years.

But this year I got him.

            Raccoons
      don't hold grudges.

    They're looking for food
    and a mate all the time.

Oh, not this one.

This one wants me.

Which is
why after school,

he is entering my raccoon
relocation program.

              Wait, what's that?

It's where I drop him off

100 miles away
from this school

and my rhubarb
experiments.

            (Crispo)
  What about his raccoon wife
       and raccoon kids?

Then I guess Mom's coaching
raccoon soccer this year.

   (chuckling)

But, allow me to give him
one last view of the game.

                    Aren't you
                    gonna leave?

                      Now?

With the door
wide open?

           Not after
      my cart disappeared.

              Out!

   Okay.

 Minor setback.
                  (Crispo)
                  Relax.

                  All we need is
                  a sky elevator

                or rocket boots.

        Get up to that window...

        pull cage out said
        window onto sky elevator

                or rocket boots,

         then lower Mr. Raccoony
         to freedom.

     You can't be serious.

         (animal growling)
               Do you see
               the sunglasses?

        Okay, one small problem.

           There's no such thing
           as sky elevators

                or rocket boots!

              (chirping)
     (truck beeping)

             What about a crane?

           Okay, stay
       with that for now.

     All right, everybody,
         that's lunch.

               â™ªâ™ª

      The plan was simple.

       Well, not simple,
    but potentially doable.

Because our parents didn't sign
       our release forms,

          we couldn't
   participate in gym class.

            Now sit on the bench
            and feel bad

           while we all have fun

        running and sweating and
        breathing in field dust.

                   (coughing)

          Make a hole.

       (whistle blowing)

      We didn't sit long.

Go, go, go!

           Oh, do not
       try this at home.

          Looking out.

   And by lowering the bucket
      just 42 centimeters,

    Crispo would be able to
pull the raccoon onto the crane

  then I lower him to freedom.

        (gears grinding)

              Ooh!

               Wrong lever.
     Wrong lever.

          Wrong lever.

               â™ªâ™ª

      Okay, just sit down

           and don't
        touch anything!

        (engine revving)

It butt starts?

          Shut it off!

          Shut it off!

It won't
butt shut off!

                 Stand back!

                  Never mind!

          (screaming)

             Hit that, hit that!

          Turn it off,
          turn it off!

               â™ªâ™ª

                   Jump off!

                   Jump off!

         Just jump off!

     In case you were still
           wondering,

 this was not part of the plan.

Okay, if you're just joining us,
     here's a quick recap.

        The night before
 my first day of seventh grade,

  a singing high school dream
      informed me that...

      â™ª High school's hard
        and miserable â™ª

       â™ª You'll lose your
 friends from middle school â™ªâ™ª

    So I decided to keep my
        friends together

            with one
        last adventure--

     freeing this raccoon.

My smart BFF agreed to join me,
          reluctantly.

          And my newly
 popular BFF agreed to join us,

      as long as we're not
         seen together.

 Which resumes our story here,
with our new principal about to

  enter her new administration
           facility.

       (engine rumbling)

          (screaming)

        Okay, bad news.

       We just destroyed
   Darth Hader's new office.

         But good news,

    we got the eighth grade
          patio back.

           (cheering)

              Hey!

           Hey, you!

      Again, the bad news.

                         Okay.

         I know I'm the smartest
         kid in school,

              but what do we do?

 We did what every responsible
       student should do

          when they've
    made an honest mistake.

             Oh...

                     Split up!

               â™ªâ™ª

        You, find them!

  Two medium ones and a tally,
    all wearing gym clothes.

Lady, it's not our
job to hunt down kids in--

             Do it!

          Who is that?

               Paul Shmalter,
               the hall monitor.

  Put down those sixth graders
      and bring me anyone

      wearing gym clothes
    who is not in gym class.

                  Hey, you.

                   You off to
                   sixth period?
       You bet I am!

               â™ªâ™ª

          Okay, hide,
           just hide.

          (whimpering)

           You don't
         need the book!

 What we need is to change out
        of these clothes

           and get to
         Spanish class.

     (school bell ringing)

Which we are now
officially cutting.

         (door opening)

               â™ªâ™ª

     This looks bad, right?

             Yeah.

      It was an accident.

           But, hey,
      it's middle school!

    Time to try new things--

 hundreds of things-- and learn
   from our mistakes, right?

       But this one thing
   got out of hand and, boy,

     have we learned a lot.

     And it was my fault--
       don't blame them.

Wait, are you
telling me that--

                 They smashed it
                 with a tractor.

             Three of them:
             two boys, one girl.

W-was the girl
wearing red sneakers?

         I don't have specifics!

Then how can
I help you?

           (clunking)

                  You know what?

              I don't want your
              help finding them.

You sure about that?

               And I don't<i> need</i>
               your help.

          I'm Principal Changer.

                    I'm changing
                    this school.

       And I will think
       about making some changes

            to my guidance staff
            in the future!

         Okay, as your
      guidance counselor,

     allow me to guide you.

        Out this window,
     then along the side of

 the building to the last door
         on your right.

      There you will find

     the lost-and-found bin
        from last year.

       Put found clothes
     over your gym clothes

   and when you get to class,

     you tell your teacher
       you were with me,

     which I will confirm.

What kind of
guidance counselor are you?

               â™ªâ™ª

      The totally awesome
and probably future-fired kind.

         Now, stay low
         and good luck.

             Wait.

Won't the sidewalks be crawling
   with construction workers

      and Principal Hader?

              Yes.

         So, uh, let's
        think about that

    and try to come up with
          a solution.

               â™ªâ™ª

       Remember, they are
      wearing gym clothes.

       And they are evil.

         Happy hunting,
            fellas.

            All right, let's go.

Here we go,
split up!

               â™ªâ™ª

                      Jackpot!

   Quick, put the clothes on
    and let's get to class.

               â™ªâ™ª

                 (gasping)

       Stop right there!

      (record scratching)

               â™ªâ™ª

          (chuckling)
         Oh, I got you.

               â™ªâ™ª

                (meowing)

And lookee
what Crispo found

       (animal growling)
in the lost and found.

                   We don't need
                   sunglasses!

             (man)
         They gotta be
     around here somewhere.

Got it, got it.

             (man)
              Yo!

       Hey, right there!

                  Go, go, go!
    Get 'em, let's get 'em!

Slow-motion would really enhance
 this moment, don't you think?

               â™ªâ™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ª

            â™ª Ahh â™ª

          â™ª Come on â™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ª

     â™ª Shake it, shake it â™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ª

            â™ª Ahh â™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ª

     â™ª Shake it, shake it â™ª

     â™ª Shake what you got â™ª

     â™ª Shake what you got â™ª

     â™ª Shake what you got â™ª

     â™ª Shake it, shake it â™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ª

            â™ª Ahh â™ª

            â™ª Ugh â™ªâ™ª

             Move!

               â™ªâ™ª

              (CJ)
            Come on!

         (all panting)

        I feel so alive!

                        Good.

           Because those of us
           not on Planet Crispo,

                     we're dead!

That way, that way,
that way.

      Wait.

This is my mom's car.

           (beeping)

              (CJ)
       Come on, come on,
      let's go, let's go.

 Go, go, move, move!
             Ow, my foot!

       Check over there!

             Okay.

         I can think of
        a hundred things

     you'd rather be doing
        right now, but--

             Get down, get down!

             Relax.

 My dad got the tinted windows
    and ultra-quiet package.

    Really?

    Hello!

We're in here!

             (man)
      Hey, I lost my shoe!

I'm a construction man,

somebody
ran over my building!

                       Get down!

         I said relax.

       They can't see in.

                  (man)
                  Not over here.

       Let's go, let's...

                 What about her?

     (cell phone vibrating)

"Hey, sweetie, just dropped
off your gym release.

          XOXOX"-- Oh.

               â™ªâ™ª

    There were three of them
      in the parking lot.

         But we lost them.
            Perfect.

       Because that means
     they're not in class.

   So I just have to wait for
    sixth period attendance

  to be returned and the three
 that are missing will be mine.

       Then I will expel

     the office-destroying
  delinquents from this school

        and be cheered.

      (children chanting)
         Hader, Hader,

         Hader, Hader,
     Hader, Hader, Hader...

               â™ªâ™ª

        (phone ringing)

             Hello?

          Oh, hi, hon.

           Yeah, um,
    I dropped off CJ's form

   and I stopped by the house
        to grab a snack

       and feed the fish.

             Yeah.

 Everyone looked like they were
having a really happy first day.

               â™ªâ™ª

         (door closing)

       We are not happy.

      Instead of being in
     sixth period Spanish,

       we are at<i> su casa!</i>

              (CJ)
  Just to reiterate, this was
    definitely not the plan.

                Ooh, water pita!

Don't eat that.

               â™ªâ™ª

      Why did you have to
       rescue a raccoon?

        I mean, why not
       do something easy

   like steal a school bus or
    kidnap Gym Coach LaBeau?

              Is Coach LaBeau
              a dude or a woman?

It doesn't matter as long
as he/she is happy.

                    Makes sense.

      Why did you have to
       rescue a raccoon?

Hey, you agreed
to do it.
                  Guys, chill.

        I just want her
        to tell us why.

It's not just about rescuing
the raccoon, okay?

It's about rescuing us.

               â™ªâ™ª

My brother and this
singing dream/nightmare

said that middle school
friendships

don't make it
to high school.

And I didn't want that
happening to us.

      Why would you think
   we wouldn't stay friends?

             Yeah, we're gonna
             be friends forever.

             Liars.

    You said, "See you after
          graduation."

     And you're hiding our
   friendship behind a book.

         You still have
           Angelica?

                Cool sunglasses.

It's her beach look.

And she's
my good luck charm.

We rescued her the first day
of kindergarten, remember?

And she likes hugs.

                  I like hugs.
  Don't you dare--

                          CJ.

               â™ªâ™ª

         This is nice.

              Besides, what does
              Ronbie know about

           high school, anyways?

             I know
        it's horrifying.

       But you get out at
             2:00.

      Now why are you here

           and is Fen
       wearing my pants?

             Maybe.

It's a long story
that starts with us

destroying the new
principal's office

while trying to
free a raccoon

and ends
with us in Mom's car

getting expelled once
Mrs. Knapp hands in

sixth period attendance.

           Cat-Knapp
     still teaches Spanish?

     Cat-Knapp?
           Cat-Knapp?
                 Cat-Knapp?

    She's like 90 years old
   and sleeps all class long.

           (snoring)

       You don't have to
    worry about attendance.

      She never takes it.

So you're saying if
we get back to school

by seventh period,

the crazy new principal
won't know we were gone?

              Yep.

               â™ªâ™ª

       (animal growling)
       We've got seven minutes.

        Why are you all
    looking at me like that?

       (tires screeching)

        Can't this thing
         go any faster?

      (rock music blaring)

              The speed limit is
              15 miles per hour

               and do you
               see the potholes?

       (tires screeching)

          Change the station,
          I hate this song.

   (classical music playing)

           (snoring)

     (school bell ringing)

                   Can you stop?

     Look, the speed limit
             is 35!
Look, the speed limit
is 35!

       (tires screeching)
             (all)
             Yeah!

       (tires screeching)
             (all)
              No!

           Pass her,
     you've gotta pass her!

         With minors in the car.

               You want me to
               lose my license?!

We've got
three minutes!

            Angelica
       will lead the way!

        CJ said she was
           good luck.

         (horn honking)

       (tires screeching)

She is good luck.

Have you seen
Crispo?
               No.

      What are you doing?

            Go back, go back!
You passed the school!

                  Front door's
                  always locked,

        but the maintenance door
        is always open.

                     Move!

               â™ªâ™ª

Love you!
                  Love you too.

               I can't hold
               Angelica anymore.

                He's still going
                with the book?

               â™ªâ™ª

             (Crispo)
             Hey, there you are.

     Let's get to seventh period
     totally on time.

               â™ªâ™ª

           (panting)

       Where were you
       and what are you wearing?

I was in the bathroom.

                    For an hour?

Yeah, it was so bad
I had to change my clothes.
                   (gasping)

           (chirping)

             What are you doing?

                     We're gonna
                     make it!

                   No!
                   No raccoon!

The door's open!

           Which means
           Slinko's coming back!

It's looking at me!

It's giving me
the look.

          It's not about saving
          the raccoon, remember?

           It's about saving us.

          And we have
          10 seconds to save us.

                   No, do not go
                   into that...

     (school bell ringing)

     Welcome to study hall.

       Open your books...
             study.

       If you have to go
   to the bathroom, go nuts.

         (CJ grunting)

             Come on,
             gotta get you free.

   Hello, CJ.

Decide to skip
study hall?

                    Uh, no, I...

This is Paul Shmalter,
the hall monitor.

I have a class cutter
by the name of...

Anybody need help...

or sunglasses?

         We don't need
          sunglasses!

        We just let him go while
        the halls are empty,

         guide him down the
         stairs to an open door.

                    But I can't
                    get it open.

       I know what to do!

           Help her.

             Move!

    Ready?

                   Be free!

      (screeching)
                (screaming)

     (screaming continues)

                    Huh.

       Raccoons do hold grudges.

          (screaming)

        (all screaming)

     (screaming continues)

We've done
a good job here today.

Fire!
There must be a fire!

          No, no, no!

      (fire alarm ringing)

           Side note:
    Never pull a fire alarm

    unless you are positive
        you see a fire.

            And not
        a loose raccoon.

     (screaming continues)

         <i> (woman on PA)</i>
     <i> Fire alarm detected.</i>

      <i> Please move quickly</i>
         <i> to the exits.</i>

            (Hader)
          Remain calm.

     Remain calm, everyone.

             Good,
        go to the exits.

        (all screaming)

          Remain calm!

          Remain calm,
      for goodness sakes!

     (screaming continues)

        (sirens blaring)

            Heck of
       a first day back.

           All right,
        go on this way.

          (screaming)

              Oh!

               â™ªâ™ª

             Well,
         that was easy.

            (Hader)
  Well, look who it is again.

            You two.

    With another kid who has
  a book in front of his face.

        Principal Hader.

         There was a...

     a raccoon in the hall,
  but we let it out the door.

           Good thing
         we were here.

          Oh, really?

  Is that what happened here,

       new kid whose face
     I can't see or trust?

       (Crispo)
       We like doing good things
       for our school

                   that we love.

                       Things.

         What is that?
       What is it saying?

What he means is

the confidence
and strength you project

inspires us all to
do great things.

Thank you.

Well,
you're welcome.

I am here to inspire.

             And might I suggest
             early dismissal.

             We've had a lot
             of excitement today

          and I think you'll win
          even more students

           with your compassion.

                  (whispering)
                  Do it before
                  somebody dies.

I am compassionate too.

     Hader, Hader, Hader...

         (all chanting)
      Hader, Hader, Hader,

     Hader, Hader, Hader...

Oh, early
dismissal, everyone!

     (school bell ringing)
         (all cheering)

                Principal Hader!

              I saw them,
              the three of them!

                  All in--
    Shut it, Paul.

I'm being cheered.

           (cheering)

            (Hader)
            Up high.

       Principal Changer
         in the house!

     Well, thanks for that,
    uh, one last adventure.

   I guess it's back to your
 studies and back to your book.

        See you around.

Seriously,
you're leaving?

            (Crispo)
   'Cause if we're gonna stay
        friends forever,

        we're gonna need
a lot more one-last adventures.

                  Well, this is
                  middle school,

           the time to live life
           and try new things.

How many things?

                  I can think of
                  a hundred.

            (Crispo)
              Ooh!

           Then we're
       gonna need these.
       (animal growling)

        So looking back,

do I recommend freeing a raccoon
  on your first day of school?

             Yeah!

Because I learned that no matter
      how bad things get,

       we have the power
     to make things better.

 I learned that with friends by
your side, you can do anything.

 And I learned that slow-motion
  makes everything look cool.

               â™ªâ™ª

     But if you don't have
  a raccoon in your homeroom,

  try just getting out of your
         comfort zone.

         Sure, it might
      get a little crazy,

   but isn't that the point?

And the biggest thing I learned
     from my singing dream

       is that these are
the greatest years of our lives,

       so let's make sure
         we break out.

        All you need is
       a little courage,

   a couple of good friends--

      oh, and don't forget
        the sunglasses.

     One down and 99 to go.
