JESSIE: Previously
on Jessie...


You're going to spend

the weekend

on a military base.

In Texas!


(PLAYING FANFARE)
(ALL SCREAMING)

Dad!
Jessie!

I'm Caleb.

And I'm... Uh...

Emma.

Sure took you long enough
to come back to visit.

Well, this is the first time

you've asked me back.

You know,

you don't talk about

your mom much.

What was she like?

Oh, she was the best.

Great news.

Your old friend,

Darla, is here.

Friend?

She threw me down a well!

Oh, my stars and stripes!

Dar-Dar, is that you?

Yes, Mommy!

Look what they did to me!

Why do you care - so much if I get along
With Darla?

After this trip, - I'll never have
To see her again!

Oh, yes you will,

because you and Darla

are going to be sisters.

What?

See, we wanted

you girls to become friends

before we told you,

but now
we're out of time.

Our wedding is tomorrow.

Wait, tomorrow?

As in, the day after today?

Yes, if I can
wait that long.

The only man
I've had in my life

In the last 10 years
is Uncle Sam.

And now, I want you!

Wait, wait, wait.

So that's why you

invited me to come home?

Yes, and I invited you,

not these little threats

to national security.

Now get out of my B.A.T.

I had the seat

just where I liked it.

We are extremely sorry, sir.

Even though I did not do

anything, and it was

all Luke's fault.

Okay, that one is on me.

By the way, for the wedding,

could you put me down

for a vegetarian meal?

â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

â™ª Hey Jessie, hey Jessie

â™ª It feels like a party

every day

â™ª Hey Jessie, hey Jessie

â™ª But they keep on pulling

me every which way

â™ª Hey Jessie, hey Jessie

â™ª My whole world is changing

Turning around

â™ª They got me going crazy

Yeah, they're shaking

the ground

â™ª But they took a chance

on the new girl in town

â™ª And I don't want to let them

down, down, down

â™ª Hey Jessie

â™ª Hey Jessie

â™ª It feels like a party

every day

â™ª Hey, hey, hey,

hey, hey, Jessie â™ª

I can't believe my dad

is getting remarried

to Darla's mom.

Darla is a total...

(MIXER WHIRRING)


(MIXER TURNS OFF)

And my dad knows how I feel,

but clearly

he doesn't give a...

(MIXER WHIRRING)

Bertram, I feel like you

don't care

about my problems.

What makes you say that?

There's nothing
in that blender.

Listen! The rehearsal

brunch is today.

They're getting
married tonight,

And my whole world
is falling apart!

Ooh, so,
there's gonna be a brunch?

You're missing the point.

There's going

to be a wedding!

Ooh, so there's
gonna be cake!

Well, I better bake it

instead of Corporal Cookie,

or even the little bride

and groom on top

of the cake will hurl.


Hey!
(BOTH EXCLAIM IN SHOCK)

And no one is baking - the wedding cake
Of my officers except me.

Well, get ready

for a dishonorable

discharge.

Which everybody's - gonna have,
If you make it.


You know what?

You make your cake,

I'll make mine,

and we'll see who gets

the last laugh.

Besides your barber.

Have I mentioned

Darla and I have to wear

matching bridesmaid dresses?

We'll look like - a couple of...
(MIXER WHIRRING)


Emma, to celebrate
the end of the feud,

I drew a picture
of us together.

See, the Pegasus represents

our love,

which has lifted us

above all the obstacles

in our path.

Aw, that is so deep.

Who are these two people?

That's you and me.

Oh, thank goodness.

I was afraid it was you

and Blake Lively.

So then the trapezoid

said to the triangle,

"Quit being obtuse!"
(LAUGHING)

You're the reason

the Math Club meets

in the boiler room.

Hey, let's go find that B.A.T.

No! Jessie forbade it,

and I will not leave

this place no matter what.

(FEEDBACK CRACKLING)

Okay, everybody,

time for speeches.

Wait for me!

I just want to thank you

all for coming

to our rehearsal brunch.

Even though you had

no choice, because it was

an order. (LAUGHING)

I just want to say

that I cannot wait

wait for this officer

to stop acting like

a gentleman.

Okay, J.W., it's your turn.

Oh, no. No, thanks.

Did it sound

like I was asking,

soldier?

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

I'm not much for speeches.

If you talk in a foxhole,

the enemy's likely

to find you

and take you out!

Next, my future daughter,
Darla.

Hmm, okay. Um...

I am so glad my mom

is marrying J.W.

I've always admired

his daughter, Jessie.

Wait for it.

Not everyone could fail

so miserably at acting,

and still have

the courage to keep trying,

even though

she gets rejected over

and over and over.

And there it is.

Kind of like the way she was

rejected by all of

the boys in high school.

She was so unpopular

that even the vending - machines rejected
Her quarters.

Okay, all right.

Thank you, Darla.

That was fascinating.

Just like your

stories about collecting

barf bags at 30,000 feet.

And your "how

to-put-on-a-seatbelt"

speech

is always a big hit
at parties.

And I know that
whenever I need advice,

Jessie will always be there,

because, Lord knows,
she's never out on a date.

Let's hear
it for Darla Shannon.

If her name sounds familiar,

it's probably because

you wrote a complaint - letter
to an airline - About her.

(BOTH LAUGHING)


This is awesome!

This is fun!

This is going

to be the day I die!

And I was so looking

forward to puberty!

You should've seen
Darla's face in high school.

The moon had less craters.

Then again,
the moon didn't eat

Four personal pan
pizzas for lunch every day.

Okay, at least

I didn't have to eat

with the cafeteria lady.

Olga was a sparkling

conversationalist.

At least, I assume so.

I don't speak Russian.

Congratulations, Luke.

You have driven us

to the mess hall,

the one place

we are sure to get caught.

That's where
the rush comes in.

I'll just go in reverse.

It must be this "R" button.

(GUESTS SCREAM)

Incoming!

(WHISPERS)
You think anybody noticed?

Luke, did it ever occur

to you that

"R" might stand
for "rocket"?

I told you kids

never to set foot

in that thing again.

We can explain!

Ravi made us do it!

Okay, I can fix this.

All I need is a hammer,

a screwdriver,

and a time machine.

Dad, I can explain.

It was an accident.

You think maybe

if you had been
watching these kids

Instead of trading
insults with Darla,

This accident would
never have happened?

Okay, I got carried away.

That was a mistake.

But so is ambushing

your daughter with

a surprise wedding!

PRESCOTT:
I was afraid if I told you

I was marrying

Darla's mom over

the phone, you'd freak out!

What do you think
I'm doing now?

I came back here

to try and make things

right between us.

But instead I'm stuck

with a new family,

and you didn't
even ask me!

Why should I ask you?

You didn't ask

me when you ran off

to New York!

Because I knew you wouldn't
be supportive!

It's a lot easier

to be supportive when

somebody makes good decisions.

Leaving home

was a good decision.

Mom always told me
to follow my dreams.

She'd be proud
that I moved to New York.

Not if she saw

what a disaster

it's turned into.

Well, if that's how you feel,

then maybe I just should

just not come to your wedding.

If that's what you want.

It wouldn't be the first time

you went AWOL

from this family.

That's it.

Kids, we're going back

to New York, right now.

They're going
to tear us apart!

We have to run away!

Okay, but I'm wearing - high heels,
so you might - Have to carry me.

Done.

And I thought our private jet
was a fun way to travel!

Jump in. I'll drive us
to the airport.

Get out of that vehicle!

Or you know what?

Don't. I don't care.

I'm done.

What do you mean?

I mean you knew how important
this weekend was to me,

But you obviously didn't care.

You deliberately disobeyed me,

over and over,

and I'm sick of it!

We promise it will

never happen again.

You're right, it won't.

And it's not

my problem anymore,

because I quit.

I hope you two
are satisfied.

Because of your malfeasance,

we are going to

lose Jessie!

Hey, her quitting

is your fault, too!

You're the one
who's supposed to stop us

From doing
stupid stuff like that.

Yeah, you're like our smaller,

more annoying Jiminy Cricket.

Jessie, you have

every right to be angry,

but please, do not quit.

Yeah, we're really,

really, really sorry.

Sorry doesn't
cut it this time.

I promise, we've
learned our lesson.

Good, then I hope

you'll be more respectful

to your next nanny.

We do not want another nanny!

We just want you.

You're the best nanny
in the whole wide world!

And Emma would agree,

if she had not run away

with Caleb when

you were not paying attention.

What?
Why didn't you tell me?

After you quit,
there was a power vacuum.

We did not know

who to report to.

Emma's not picking up.

How am I supposed

to find them?

Well, I know where
there is a computer

That can triangulate

her cell phone signal

and pinpoint her location.

Great, where is it?

In the B.A.T.

Of course it is.

Well, then I guess

we're taking that B.A.T.

Yes! I am so proud of you

right now.

Which will probably

never happen again,

so enjoy it.

Okay, everybody buckle up.

I hope this thing is fast.

There's a button marked "F."

Maybe that means fast.

Right there.

It means "fly"!

Or "fetal position,"

which I will now assume.

And I'm gonna assume

the whoo-hoo position.

Whoo-hoo!

I want one of these

for Christmas,

but pink and with streamers!

I'm glad you guys
are both having fun.

Meanwhile,

I think I just

got a bug in my teeth.

Although my vision

is blurred from fear,

I believe the computer

has located Emma's

cell signal!

Great, where is she?

I have good news

and bad news.

What's the good news?

Emma appears

to be in a munitions bunker.

The munitions bunker

is where they keep all

of the deadly explosives!

And that was the bad news.

Way to steal my thunder.


Sorry, I couldn't find us

a more romantic place to hide.

Any place with you
is romantic.

I just won't be lighting

these candles I brought.

Oh, you look cold.

Do you want my jacket
or something?

LUKE: Sweet!

ZURI: Yeah!

RAVI: God protect us.


Are we in heaven?

Am I playing washboard

for the late, great country

legend, Tammy Wynette?

Then no.

Okay, I'll run in and grab
Caleb and Emma.

You guys stay put.

And don't touch anything!

But I want a snow cone.

It has a
snow cone maker, too?

No wonder you guys
keep stealing this thing.

Jessie,

I am not going back

to New York.

Don't even bother to ask.

Oh, I'm not asking.
I'm grabbing and pulling.

You can't separate us!

We're two souls
that have become one.

Your two souls - can video chat.
We're leaving.

No! I'm staying here

with Caleb. I love him!

(ALARM BLARING)

AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Munitions bunker in lockdown.

Emma, you just locked us

in a room packed

with deadly explosives!

As opposed to safe explosives?

Sorry, I get sarcastic
when I'm nervous.

AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Munitions bunker in lockdown.

Cool!

I know I should care - that
Jessie and Emma - Are trapped,

But I'm all hopped up
on snow cones!

Want some? - Want some?
Want some?

Emma, why did you do that?

You left me no choice.

No choice?

You didn't hear me mention

the video chat option?

And you shouldn't have run
away in the first place.

That never solves anything.

Says the girl who's running
away from her own

Father's wedding.

(SCOFFS) That is
completely different!

Somewhat different.

Okay, it's exactly the same.

But I'm running away

from the demon seed, Darla!

No offense.
None taken.

She used to hold

me down and make me

smell her armpit.

That is a terrible thing
to do to a little kid.

It was this morning.

So you're going to let Darla

make things worse between

you and your dad?


Look, it's not just Darla.

I never thought my dad
would get married again.

But he's fallen in love.

Don't you want him
to be happy?

Well, of course I do, but...

Everything

is happening so fast.

I don't want

my family to change.

You wouldn't understand.

Actually, I do understand.

When my parents adopted Luke,

then Zuri, then Ravi,

I was upset, because

I didn't want my family

to change.

But now I love them

more than anything.

Even Luke,

who's about as

demon seed as they come.

But my dad and I have been

through a lot together.

We've always been a team.

You can still be a team,

you're just adding

a few more players.

Yeah, but I'm getting Darla
on my team.

Well, I got a 7-foot

lizard with rat breath

and a scary, forked tongue.

Okay, it's a draw.

I guess my dad deserves

to start a new chapter

in his life.

Like I did when I moved

to New York and started taking

care of you guys.

Exactly, and look

how great that turned out.

It did, didn't it?

How did you get so smart?

I've had a great teacher.

Besides, I know

a lot about love.

After all, - I've been in it
For two whole days.

Just wait until you can

finally make a guy really care

about you, too.

Okay, moment over.

But you're right.
I should get to that wedding.

Except I can't,

because, thanks to you,

I'm locked in!

Maybe Luke, Ravi and Zuri

will try to blast us

out of here with the B.A.T.


a room full of explosives

equipped with - a hair-trigger
Self-destruct system

In case someone

tries to steal them.

Not even they

would be dumb

enough to fire on it.

Ready, aim, fire!


Nimrods.

(SIREN BLARING) - AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Munitions bunker under attack.

Activate self-destruct

sequence,

Well, that's not good.

ALL: Help! Let us out.

I can't believe
Jessie's really not coming.

Maybe I was too hard on her.

Aw, she wouldn't miss

your wedding.

I know it.
She'll be here.

I don't know.

I haven't seen her this mad
since she broke curfew

And I took away
the keys to her tank.

Hey, Dar-Dar,

have you seen Jessie?

No. With any luck,

she fell down that well again.

Oh, hey, if she's been

in that cold water

long enough,

she could be your
something blue.

Peanuts?

We're going
to get blown to bits!

And you're too pretty
to be rubble!

I know!

Jessie, do something!

(SPEAKING HINDI)

Okay, you have been spending

way too much time with Ravi.


See? I told you "G"

was for "grappling hook"!

Even a broken clock

is right twice a day.

Guys,

I never thought
I would say this,

But thank you
for disobeying me!

You're welcome.

And you can thank us

by becoming our nanny again.

Jessie, please,

you cannot quit.

You are part of our family.

And we love you.

I love you guys, too!

And I'm not going anywhere.

LUKE: Yes!
Except to that wedding.

Wow, Jessie quit

and I didn't even know?

I really am self-involved.

All right. Everyone in?

Buckled, buckled.

Okay. Brace yourselves.

I'm hitting "T" for "turbo."

Or toast.

I gotta say, both these cakes

would definitely

pass inspection.

Agreed.

But I think my confection

is perfection.

Oh, yeah? Well.

Your icing tastes like dirt.

That's your finger.

Oh, yeah. I really - should wash my hands
More often.

Ugh.

Look, we're both great chefs.

It doesn't really matter
who wins.


Oh.
(LUKE LAUGHS)

But I just did!

What kind of twisted

sicko laughs at someone

else's misfortune?



Oh, now I get it.

This is fun.


This icing tastes like dirt.

Ha ha, told ya.


Darla, I am so...

Happy that happened.


Jessie! You came!

Dad.

I'm sorry I crashed

your wedding. Literally.

That's okay.

It was considerate - of you to crash
through - The same hole in the wall.

Yeah, that was the plan.

I'm just glad you're here.

And I'm very sorry

to have sprung

all this on you.

It's okay, Dad.

You deserve to be happy.

Thank you, pumpkin.

That's the best wedding
present you could give me.

Do you, John Wayne Prescott,

take Beverly Shannon,

to love, honor and cherish?

I do.

And do you, Bev...

Affirmative!


Well, I now pronounce you

man and wife.

You may now...

Uh, well, just keep on

doing what you're doing.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

(GROWLS SUGGESTIVELY)

(EXPLOSION)
(GUESTS GASP)

Hey, who set off
the fireworks?

Uh-oh. Someone forgot

to shut down

the self-destruct sequence

on the munitions bunker.

Ravi...

So, Darla, now that

we are "sisters,"

should we try
and get along?

Absolutely.

Do you wanna take

a walk by the old well?

And the feud continues.

I hope you have

nine airsick babies

on your next flight!

So, we're gonna

video chat every day, right?

Right. Let's start now.

Hi!
Hi!

I miss you.
I miss you more.

You know,

once you pick off

the floor lint,

your cake tastes great.

Yours is great, too.

But I think I've found

something even sweeter.

Oh, the mini-churros?

No... You,

you big love-burger.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Well, Corporal Cookie,
I'm flattered,

But, uh...

I have two weeks

leave next month.

I'm gonna come stay with you,

and take a bite

out of the Big Apple!

(GROWLS SUGGESTIVELY)
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

But just the Apple, right?

You know, Jessie,
it's very impressive

That those kids saved you
from that bunker.

Yeah. I got a pretty

good squad.

Well, a squad is only

as good as its leader.

You've obviously been
a good influence on them.

Wow, marriage

really agrees with you.

No, I mean it.
They are lucky to have you.

And...

I think you did make - the right decision
Going to New York.

Really?

Thanks, Daddy.
That means a lot.

Your mother would be
so proud of you.

And she'd be happy for you.

We're never gonna
forget her, right?

How could I?

Whenever I look at you,

I see her.

All right,

all the single ladies,

fall in.

Come on.

(EXCITED CHATTERING)

Not Cookie, not Cookie.

Wow, that's the first time
I ever prayed for that.

ALL: Me, me!
Over here.



Hello.


Darla, I assume

you know where the exits are.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
