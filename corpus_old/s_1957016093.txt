Ethan.
You've made me unemployable.


If you're determined to go, go.

Good luck.

But you'll get no credit
here, and no support from me.

You'll be doing this
on your own.

about my consciousness work.


Everything generated here
belongs to the university.



Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head

starts with me.

[keys clicking]

[machine humming]

won't open it for weeks.

people call.

Okay, I swear, I can't with
him.

He would starve if I
didn't tell him to eat.

So.
Wait, you opened my mail?

I did.
You can't do that.

Dr. Ethan Kochar, we are
grateful for the opportunity

to consider your article.

We are pleased to inform you...

Read the punchline.
I know, I know,

that your article on
protein folding and memory

will be the focus of the March
5th publication of Nature.

What?

You serious?

Pretty good.

See, I should open
your mail more often.


Believe it or not, that
is not a telenovela clip.

It is a memory of yours truly

from when I made
the cover of Nature.

So how did we capture it?

You'll recall that
memories exist

as physical imprints
on the brain.

The R-9X identifies
these engrams

based on their
protein expressions

and transfers that data from
our internal hard drives

to external ones.

But making those memories
legible is a challenge

in and of itself.

You remember Berkeley, 2011.

Before I took over, the
R-9X could not render images

more clear than that.

So what do you think was
missing?


Thank you, Rachel, yes.

Euphoria, fear, lust.

Every memory is tied to an
emotional section of our brain,

even the ones that we bury
deep in our subconscious.

[rain pattering]



A sound, a smell, a shape

is all it takes for recall.


[insistent knocking]


[door closes]

Shit.

[whimsical music]

So to get to legible memories,

I knew that mapping emotions was
key.

May 16th, 2019.

Previous findings show that
the R-9X can download memories.

Current experimentation is
a progression of that work.

Our major premise, the
link between our emotions

and our accumulated memories
regulates human consciousness.

Minor premise, the R-10
can isolate the sections

of the brain which impact
emotions and behavior.

Conclusion, the R-10 is capable

of controlling human
consciousness.


So why does this matter anyway?

I mean, it's nice to be
able to watch our memories

like home videos, but to what
end?

What about affecting
consciousness?

The emotions tied to memories

exist along synaptic pathways,
right?

So what if our ideal
self's just a question

of turning the right ones on and
off?

Isn't that, like, unethical?

Ah, there he is.

All right, how so, Mitchell?

altering

what makes you you.

Does anybody else find
Mitchell's stubbornness,

endearing or
is it just me?

I'm talking about a machine
calibrated to the individual.

A machine that can erase a
veteran's PTSD,

that suppresses the reward
center for an opioid junkie,

and that could boost your
intellect.

I'm sure some of you
could benefit from that.

Imagine, consciousness
constructed to your own liking.

Memories curated to a desired
state.

And yes, perhaps,

changing yourself for the
better.

All right, well, that's
enough for this week.

Be sure to read my essay on
the self and temporal sequence

by next class.

Have a great week.

Still struggling with the
initiation.

But I've ruled out the
distributors,

so it must be the equation.

[keys clicking]

Side note, I had another
blackout this morning.

Indeterminate time, but they
are becoming more frequent.

I'm still hoping that
the R-10 can pinpoint.

the mind

is the basis for all those who
come after.

His work, fully realized in the
R-9X,

is perhaps the most
groundbreaking discovery

of this century.

With applications from
education to national security.

So before I present the
plaque for our new lab,

I've asked Dr. Kochar's
partner to say a few words.

The co-creator of the
R-9X, Dr. Malcolm Bloom.


Thank you, Dean Myers, and
thank you all for coming.

We were all fortunate
enough to know Dr. Kochar.

But for a cocksure doctoral
student,

a position in his lab was dumb
luck.

I never questioned his
judgment, never had to.

Until he asked me to be his
partner.


You can say that I knew
Paul better than most.

No one could match his
brilliance.

Kendall, Kahneman, Einstein,
these are his equals.

We'll be hard-pressed to see
Dr. Paul Kochar's influence

matched in our lifetime.

[smooth rock music]

There's the wunderkind.

You're a hard man to track down.

How's it coming?

Good.
Good.

That's good to hear.

Good enough for tomorrow.

I thought you rescheduled.

I did, for tomorrow.

No.

No, no, no, no.

Come on, Ethan, work with me,

so I can keep the committee off
your back.

best.

Well I've got practice.

Ethan, look, you're going
through a lot.

I get it, we all miss your dad.

They'll replace you with someone
else if you don't deliver.

I thought I already did.

I fought hard for your credit,

but the R-9 was started
with your father and me.

You want one?

No, I quit.

Really?

Everyone who matters knows
you finished the R-9.

Forget the patent plaque.


Please, Ethan.

It's, it's not ready.

Then bullshit your way through.

Whatever you're working on,
present it.

Ethan, we need this renewal.

I'm gonna need you at 9:30.

I need you to be there tomorrow.

Yeah.
9:30, okay?

[serene soul music]

Sir?

Sir.

Are you sure you want another?

Yeah.

Okay, this is the last one.


What's that?

Oh, it's...

It's nothing, it's a snowflake.


I'm grateful we didn't lose her
to those Stanford hacks.

Can't I be grateful?

later.

I am so sorry.

He's just excited you're
back from Stanford.

Yeah, it's not a problem.

And Joe told me you're in
talks about the Kochar lab.

Congratulations, you must be
thrilled.

Thank you, Lauren, it
was great to see you.


Okay, sure.

Thank you.

Hi.

Hey.

You want one?

I'm fine.

How are you doing, Ethan?

I'm great.

I saw you talking with Malcolm
earlier.

How'd that go?


Just about tomorrow.

Are you ready?

Would it be better if I
wasn't?

Why don't I take you home?

You trying to get me
in bed, Dr. Fischer?

If memory serves, you're
no use in your current state.

Mm.

Come on, I was an early
programmer, remember?

Let me help you prepare.

I work better when I don't
have

to walk you through things.

It's just...

I'd rather...
It's fine.



If you're gonna make me choose,
I won't!

you to choose, Ethan!

It's not me or the
work, you can have both.


what else to say to you.

If you wanna go, go.

stay.

I want you to say that.

[phone ringing]



one.

What's wrong?

everything's great.

Did you send me something in the
mail?


notebooks.


Yeah, it's got a
bunch of his work in it.

Mom?


I didn't send it, you know I
don't have anything of his.

Shit.




Nothing, I hit my nose.

episode?

Yes.


This morning, in the bathtub.

And then again at the
dedication.


Ethan, you need to get checked
out,

it's been eight months of this.

Yeah, I know, I'm fine.

Hey, are you sure you don't know

anything about this notebook?


It's not like he shared
any of that with me

when we were married.

Okay, well I gotta, gotta go.

I got a big day tomorrow.

thanks for the wake up call.

No, I know, sorry.

[speaking foreign language]

me you'll get checked out

as soon as you can.

The university doesn't have to
know.

You know Peggy Sanders,
Darren's mom?

Had horrible migraines, just
horrible.

He was able to get her to a
specialist

who cleared it right up.

I'm gonna call her, see
if I can get a referral.

[solemn music]

You have to take better care of
yourself.

Ethan?

Mom, I gotta go.

[keys clicking]

Holy shit.

May 17th, 2019.

12:58 a.m. and counting.

R-10 has a calibrated map of my
brain.

I'm counting nine sections.

Oh, there's a high
co-activity in my cerebellum

and prefrontal cortex in section
five.

Labeling section five

as my core intellect.

Okay, I'm going to isolate
section five

and attenuate the others for an
hour.

See if I get any smarter.

Why not?

Baseline note.

I'm a little drunk.

[foreboding music]

[heart thumping]



It's 1:03 a.m.

No discernible boost
in cognitive awareness.

At least not yet.


Shit.

Shit!



[birds shrieking]


Shit.

Another blackout.

Full memory loss for an hour.

Let's look again at the
memory wipe from last year.

I had a week of anterograde
amnesia,

and now these blackouts.

But I don't know, this
one feels different.

As for last night's experiment,

intelligence isolation appear...


Intelligence isolation appear...


I'm glad you're in such a good
mood,

but I just can't help but worry

after how you sounded last
night.

I know how much you've dealing
with...

Hey Mom, I'm sorry,
I can't talk right now.

[foreboding music]

Coil readout.

All the coils are up.

Who ran this?

I didn't run this, who the fuck
ran this?

12:05, 25 seconds, 26.

27.

Okay, 55, 56, 57.

Six minutes, six minutes past,

six, six...

[tires screeching]
Christ!

I could've fucking killed you,
man!

[ominous music]

Get the fuck out of, oh my god.

[heart thumping]


â™ª It's what she told
me, don't try so hard â™ª

â™ª Ain't got a chance, I've gotta
go â™ª

["Don't Be So Nice" by Chuck
Senrick]

â™ª Please, please forgive me â™ª

Okay, it's 2:04 p.m.

I don't know how, but someone
set up the security system.

There are four live feeds
set up around the house.

I'm gonna try to figure
out what's going on.

[keys clicking]

[wind rustling]

[mouse squeaking]

[phone vibrates]



Can I help you, Malcolm?

You wanna tell me what
happened this morning?

Oh, yeah, the grant renewal.

Yeah.

I got a little tied up here.

All right.

Open the door.

I can't do that.

I'll talk to you tomorrow, I
promise.

Hey, you're not the only
person on this project.

You fuck up, it comes back on
me.

Malcolm, the only reason
why they listen to you

is because you got me to come
back.

My work on this project
was just as crucial as yours.

You wanna escalate this?

I'm more than happy to involve
the police.

[tense music]

Either way, you're gonna open up
the door.

Okay.

Just give me a minute.

[thunder rumbling]


[distorted singing]

Oh, baby.

Like an angel!

Shut up.

See, time is curved.

This is how it's supposed to be.

[distorted chatting]


[foreboding music]


Okay.

It's 1:32 p.m.

I've installed four
wireless security cameras

around the house so we
can track my behaviors.

Instead of suppressing
my competing emotions,

it seems we've isolated them.

Looks like 10 sections,
including the default.

Be sure to take precautions
against any outliers.

Time to work.

[unsettling music]

Can anybody hear me?

Hello!

Alli?
Ethan, what the fuck?

What, what happened?

You tell me!
No, I don't know

what you're doing here.

you that.

Why are you in this room?

You locked me in.

You took my phone, you
were all over the place.

Hello?

You were trying to fuck me.

And then you passed out, and
I...


Ethan?

Ethan.

[whimsical music]

What are you doing here?

I screwed everything up.

No, wait, wait.

Please, please, please,
don't go.

Please don't.
Okay.

Please don't leave me.
Ethan, calm down.

I'll be right back, okay?

there?

Ethan, just tell me what's
going on.

Tell me what the fuck
you were doing in there.

[ominous music]

Don't, no, no, no!

No!
Get out!

Open the door, Alli!

Open the door, open the door!

at Ethan's.

Something's happened.
Baby?

Just call me when you get
this,

or I'll explain when I
get back to the office.


Hey, I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened before.

Hey, remember when we
went down to the stacks,

and oh god, you were so wild.


I can't stop thinking about it.

I want you so bad right now.


Ethan?

Ethan.

Ethan, wake up.

[door closes]

Alli?

Alli, please wait.

Look, Ethan, back off.

Alli, please wait.

This is monumental for both of
us.

Last night I had a breakthrough,

but it left my consciousness
fractured,

so now there are 10 of us.

But we each only have
six minutes every hour,

which is why I need your help.

I only have a few minutes left.

I need you to wait here
'til the top of the hour.

That's when the default
is back in control.

Look.

I think you're gonna
wanna see where this goes.

[clock ticking]

That's the R-10.

It's a build out of the R-9,

but it can direct energy
at emotion and behavior.

I finally got it to map, so I
figured, okay, what the hell.

Let's isolate my
intellect, see the effect.

But this morning, I wake up,

and suddenly I'm skipping
through time.

I'd been having these blackouts,
so I figured it was that,

but it keeps happening, like
clockwork.

Six minutes every hour.

So what were the blackouts
before?

Another experiment after my
dad died.

Okay.

So you were trying to cycle
through these fragments?

No, I wanted to attenuate
the others for an hour,

but the sequencing's off,
so every six minutes,

another section gets a turn.

Like DID.

Kind of, but these aren't
personalities.

It's all still me.

So what were you trying to
isolate?

Hard to say.

The patterns for intellect
are easy to spot,

but the others are less
pronounced.

You know, there are some
things

you shouldn't try to control.


What's it feel like when you
shift?

Headache.

Everything gets fuzzy.

I feel like I'm underwater.

Why?

I was thinking, sometimes
dissociative patients

can fight off a shift if
they know the triggers.

So if this is similar, maybe
you can push through, too.

Yeah, maybe.

The next time you feel it
coming, just try to focus.

It could buy us time.


Don't touch that, Ethan.

Did you do that?

I'm presetting this video
to play during your section.

That's section five, my
intellect.

He's the one I talked to.

So, the cycling is not
sustainable.

We're losing too much oxygen,
which means we're getting

some cortical-spreading
depression.

And these headaches, they're
gonna get worse and worse

'til there's cell death.

We need to get
to the reintegration

as fast as possible.

You're the one section that's in
balance,

so we need to map you across the
whole.

That's the reintegration,

it's like a reboot using
your consciousness.

Okay, you have 20
seconds before you shift.

When that happens, Alli, I'm
gonna need you to go to my room

and lock the door.

I'll need you back here at 6:30.

Interact with only me and the
default.

You have five seconds.




Ethan.

Ethan, just look at me.

You gotta try, Ethan, come on.

[solemn music]

[keys clicking]



There's no system confirmation,

but it's showing a power drop.

the coils correctly.

What about the old sequential
startup?


Which coil's reading?

C14.

too.


You okay?


Try C14 and D5.

Okay.

Anything?


Distributor must be fried.

It'll have to be hand-wired.

Then spike my dopamine
levels or risk a coma.

So we'll need a dopamine
agonist.


We'll be in good hands when you
take over.

What are you talking about?

Look, if you want what you're
after,

just focus on getting
default in one piece.

He'll need you to be the
face of the project anyway.


[raspy breathing]

[nurse murmuring]

[solemn music]

Hey.
Hey.


The animal lab.

Ethan, come here.

Look at me.

How do you feel?

I'm fine.

Why were you at the animal lab?

We needed MDMA for the
reboot, intellect sent me.



Okay, we need to figure out

who the hell these other
sections are.

[keys clicking]


I was dancing with your
grandmother

at one point.
Uh-huh, you did.

[fireworks popping]

There's some fireworks over
there, Ethan.

Ethan, I promise that's not
gonna help.

Just put it down, put it down.

We're just gonna work through
this, okay?

These herring bodies are
releasing doses of oxytocin,

dopamine from the basal ganglia,
too,

coming in at minute 54,
that's section nine.


Oh my god!

What?

Appreciate you, ma'am.

What do you want me to do?

self-restraint, maybe.

See this concentration
of serotonin transporters?

Yeah, kicking in at minute
six.


Generalized anxiety.

Section one.

Certain cultures, it's
considered very masculine.

cultures?

Several of them.


[gentle music]

[thunder rumbling]


[breathing deeply]

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Okay, so we have the nine
sections after default.

Section one, anxiety.

Then 12 minutes in, section two,
anger.

[whimsical music]

Section three is libido.

Section four is unconscious.

Right, all sections asleep.

Which is the opposite of you,
default,

all sections awake and in
balance.

We know that section five is
intellect.

And then section six...

Calling him primitive.

Section seven, creative.

And section nine, euphoria.

So we just need section eight.

Let's take a look at the tape.

Okay, now section eight.

[keys clicking]



Aw, for fuck's sake.


The notebook.

I got a notebook in the
mail, it was one of my dad's.

Check, check the drawer.

Had this equation.

Yes, this is all his
handwriting.

Jesus.

Yeah.

This is mine.

[foreboding music]

I don't remember any of this.



Ethan.

Ethan.

Come on, try to focus.




I can't fucking breathe!


[phone vibrating]

[phone ringing]

[phone vibrating]


Did you do this?

that it was section eight.

If so, we need to move him.

What are you doing?
Calling the police.

they'll take away the work.

We'll never get it back, and
I'll probably go to prison.

The R-10's almost ready.

We wipe his memories and
we get him out of here

like nothing happened.

This is insane, this whole
fucking thing is insane.

work.

It's that important.


[tense music]

If I do this, it's
not to protect the work.


I got his head.
Okay.

How long before the R-10's
ready?


Can you manage this?

You can't tell any of the
others, not even the default.

I need him to focus on the
reintegration.

Malcolm will be fine, trust me.


[heart monitor flatlining]

[nurse murmuring]


[muffled chatting]


You should never have left.

[singing softly]

credit here,

and no support from me.

You'll be doing this on your
own.

about my consciousness work.

Not yours.

Everything generated here
belongs to the university.


That's how this works.

Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head

starts with me.

[keys clicking]


They asked about your work
habits, I told the truth.

Stop with the melodrama.

I don't have time for
it, I don't have time.

[distorted singing]
Blow out your candles.

Paul!

Can one of you just find Paul?



Alli?

Alli!


Ethan, how are the headaches?

They're worse for me, too.

The highest functioning ones
are...

[door closes]

sec?

You should get going.
I know, but

I need to confirm something.


[door closes]

Ethan, how are the headaches?

They're worse for me, too.

The highest functioning
ones are burning out first.

I have maybe two hours left.

Creative, three.

Then probably another six hours
for you and section eight.

And so on.

I'd say we have less than 24
hours until full brain death.

So I need you to listen,

because I don't have much
more time to help you.

Alli said you remember the
notebook.

This equation is not the
solution we thought it was.

The equation we need
to do the reintegration

is from the same proof,
and I'm working on it.

But in case I run out of time,

you and Alli will have to figure
it out.

By the way, I figured
out what was going on

with those blackouts.

Seems we were trying to
communicate with ourselves,

even going so far as to
send ourself this notebook.

[whimsical music]

It's not my place to opine on
why,

but I think we saw what a
sad sack of shit we'd become,

and decided with total
conviction that the solution

was to fracture and reset our
mind.

These were clearly moments
of heightened brain activity.

It's like psychedelics.

Did you watch the video?
Yeah.

It's total bullshit.

If I had the answers
during these blackouts,

you think I'd wanna do this to
myself?

Ridiculous.

Listening to a fucking fragment.

He's got you running around
doing...

Maybe you should take a step
back.

It's all you, remember?

You did this to yourself.

Time's up.

[keys clicking]
[mouse squeaking]

[door closes]

Checklist.

Okay, I already did that.

Check the coolant tank.

Careful, it's cold.

No it's not.

It's not.

Doesn't make sense.

I changed it yesterday.

Oh shit.


[foreboding music]

Duct tape.

Seriously?
Yeah.

Will that hold?
Yeah.


Best case, it doesn't power
up.

Worst case, it fries
whoever's in the chair.

It's okay.

It'll be okay.

Ethan?
Huh?


Shit.

That's intellect.

he got on the equation.

What the fuck?

Ethan.


Who is this guy?

scans we did at UT Dallas?

Yeah, the antisocial ones?


See, this is all in line
with you, the default.

But look at the activity
in the basal ganglia here.

Psychotic.

He's gonna try to map himself
across my consciousness.

What?

Nothing.

No, Alli, I know that look,
what is it?



Ethan.

Come on, try to push through it.

Focus.

every half-baked idea

inside your head starts with me.


Did it work?

Can they push through you, too?

What's your mother's maiden
name?

name?


Come on, seriously, what is it?

Magill, why?

Don't say it again.

Section eight acts just like me,

except he's picked back
up my smoking habit.

["Maya Funk" by Bolivard]

â™ª We're all the same after all â™ª

â™ª Funk could have been Maya â™ª

â™ª We will end like the Maya â™ª

â™ª We won't see the dying sun â™ª

â™ª Decadence and slavery â™ª

â™ª Violence and misery â™ª

â™ª Funk could have been Maya â™ª





How are you feeling, Ethan?


Body's getting hit with a lot.

Like a new drug every six
minutes.

Feels pretty shitty.

Did you find the pages?

Intellect didn't know, either.

Now he's too sick to help.

If section eight figures
out that equation...

I know.

I made a real mess of this,
haven't I?

It's okay.

I'm okay.

How close were you
to the equation before?

Close.

But without the notebook, I'll
have to recreate the work.

[marker squeaking]

[foreboding music]

[rain pattering]


Shit.


There's another equation.

minutes.

God damn it.

It's on a piece of paper.

I wrote it down during
one of my blackouts.

I got it, I got it.

Here.

This is the one I used
before, from the notebook.

It's different, close, but
different.

This is the one we need.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

It's clear to me.

Can you push through again?

We've got 12 minutes now,
but we can use another six.

No, the pain's too much.

I also wonder what
happened to the other guy.

Maybe you erased your anxiety.

No, I can assure you, my
anxiety is alive and well.


Oh.

Goddamn!

Go, Alli.

Piece of shit!


[ominous music]

Why are you still here?

Ethan.

Come in the room now.

[door slams]

Why the fuck are you here?

Just calm down, let's just go
take a...

No, shut the fuck up!

You answer my fucking question,
what are you doing here?

I'm just trying to help.


Bullshit!

Bullshit!

There's an angle.

There's always a fucking angle
with you.

It's that, huh?

You're here for this, huh?


Ethan, stop it.

Stop it.

That what you want, huh?



No, no, no, Ethan, stop, stop.

Let go of me.
Just take it easy, Ethan,

try to breathe.

It's okay.
Let go!


Fuck!

Sorry.

[door slams]

Motherfucker!

I'm a big piece of shit!




Alli.

Alli.

[solemn music]



God, that feels good.

Got the equation.


Yeah.



Yeah.

Do not let anyone else have it.

How's Malcolm?


Good.

Do the reintegration first.

After that, wipe his memory.

So without you?

It'll be default's
consciousness.

He won't remember any of this,
will he?

No, he won't.

Just remind me you had no other
choice.

I'll be pissed, but I'll get
over it.

So how are we sure this
is gonna work this time?

It's just a matter of
inhibiting the right proteins.

[keys clicking]

Should've worked the first time

when I did it to myself
before, but as we know,

drunk and impulsive, my
precision suffers.

Why'd you do it?

What?

Try to wipe memories of my
father?


Resentment.

I was with him when he died.

He was so hungry.

He kept begging for food,

but the nurses wouldn't give him
any.

They were afraid he'd choke.

I was so angry.

Next thing I know, I'm in
a hospital a week later,

memories of my father still
intact.

I wish I could've been more help
to you.

We'll be fine.

I know.

[door closes]

Hey, I'm almost done with this
rewire.

Would you power up the coils?

Just wanna make sure these
connections are good.

Yeah.

What happened?

Section two.

Jesus.

Alli, I'm sorry.

Look, I don't...

I know.

Let's bring up the diagnostic.

Hey.

There's something else going on,
right?

What do you mean?

I don't know.

It's hard playing catch-up every
hour.

That's why I'm here.




what that is?

Okay, great, now give
me all of them at once.



me to check your work?


[keys clicking]

Nice.

Looks like I got it.

Should be good to go next
hour.

some rest?

No, I'm all right.


You looked in a mirror?

Okay.

I just mean, look, it's late.

You should go lie down.

I can finish.

Don't worry, I have the time.

I'll be out of here before the
shift.

["Between Us" by Cream & Sugar]

â™ª What happened between
us will never disappear â™ª

Alli, it's time to work!


â™ª That I saw you â™ª

â™ª I knew I had to get closer to
you â™ª

â™ª Just in the way you looked at
me â™ª

â™ª And said hello â™ª

[foreboding music]

[distorted singing]

[machine humming]

could you hide this from me?


I showed you, and we decided
when the R-10's up and running,

we'll wipe his memory and get
him out.

You mean you showed
intellect and he decided.

Ethan, if Malcolm remembers
any of it, we're done.

Bullshit.

You let my intellect use you.

You've been using me for
years.

And you don't give a shit
about anything but yourself.

I did this to protect you,
asshole.


Are we doing this or not?

Ethan!

Okay.

I'm setting the wipe to the last
12 hours.



Shut it off, shut it off!

[suspenseful music]

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!



[door opens]

Hello.

Malcolm home?

He is.

Brain fried?

He was lucid when I left.

We should be okay, but I don't
know.

What are you doing?

Relaxing.

Shouldn't you be in the lab?

Figured I'd sit this one out.

What are you doing?


I'm gonna get more coolant from
campus.

How you gonna use it, anyway?

The lines are shot, remember?

have to figure it out.

Sounds great.

Ethan, we had no idea what
section eight

was gonna do to Malcolm.

It was better for intellect to
handle.

Well gee...

Guess it's better when I'm in
the dark.

Why are you even here, Alli?

Well you botched your science
project...

No, no, no, I mean
why'd you leave Stanford?

You could have made a name for
yourself,

why did you come back?

You're wasting time.

They promise you my work?

They did, didn't they?

Figured I'd fuck it up
and it'd fall to you.

You know, I expect my father
to fuck me over, not you.

Ethan, your father
tried to give you credit.

The board said no.

He got sick and you finished
it, but it wasn't yours.

And now that it is, you've shut
them out.

So yeah, they asked me back.

They weren't gonna trust this
project to an angry child.

You know, I used to indulge
all this when we were together,

but the world's not out to get
you, Ethan.

I'm gonna go figure out the
coolant.

[door closes]

[rain pattering]

[muffled speech]

And be careful, that's
where the noise comes in.

You got it?

Wait.

There's some early work.

[phone vibrating]

Could be of interest.

Ethan.

You should never have left.


Hope you're not avoiding me.

I just wanted to see how you're
doing.

I know it's tough being back
home,

but I think it'll be good.

Anyway, I hate the West Coast,
but it's beautiful here.

I think we should talk things
over, so call me when you...

[foreboding music]

[mouse clicking]

[keys clicking]


Hey.

Any, any troubles?

No, I figured it out.

Good, so we're almost all set,
then.

Yeah, I just gotta rig the
coolant, and then the equation.

We'll do the reintegration next
hour.

Fantastic.

Hey, can I see it again?

Yeah.

Are you smoking?

[foreboding music]

I got worried.

Hey, Alli, it's fine.

Just give me the equation.

You pushed through,
section eight pushed through.

Oh, what are you talking
about?

What's my mother's maiden
name?

Don't be ridiculous.

Give me the equation.

Stop.

Stop, stop.

Alli, it's me.

Ethan.
No!





[keys clicking]




[ominous music]



We're running out of time.

Alli, it's me!

Open up!

Alli!

I feel real sick.

I don't think I'm gonna last
much longer.

Let me in.

Please?



[suspenseful music]

Get off me.
Don't.

Don't.

Alli.

Don't.

[tense music]

[keys clicking]

Okay, got three more minutes.

Nice work.

Ethan, don't do this.

I know you're still in there.

Have you considered the
possibility this is me?

Alli, I'm the real Ethan.

It's confirmation bias.

If you knock on my door
a few minutes earlier,

you'd be helping me.

Ethan, if you do this,
the whole you will be lost.

If I'm right, then I have to.

If I'm wrong, my choice is the
same.

Wait.

[ringing]
What?

Did someone change the clock?


[suspenseful music]

Alli.

[solemn music]


[water running]

Hey.


Good.

I want you to take over the
project.

You know the work, you're
smarter than me.

I just piss people off.

Are you sure?

I've spent too much
of my time being bitter.

And the things I'd change, I
can't.

I just know I don't wanna
do this by myself anymore.

[gentle music]

work on temporal perception,

I am proud to welcome Dr.
Fischer

as our newest tenured professor.



You're all familiar with Dr.
Ethan Kochar and his father,

and the work they pioneered.

It provided the basis for
our design of the R-11,

which the university has
graciously allowed me

to take the lead on.

Dr. Kochar's R9-X allowed
us to map the neuropathways

of memories and extract them.

Similarly, the R-10 allowed us

to map the neuropathways of
consciousness,

giving insight into the
architecture of behavior.

What we saw was both
surprising, and yet logical.

Our personalities share
considerable real estate

with our memories.

But we still have a choice to
make.

We get to decide how we
interpret our experiences

and how they effect who we are.


Malcolm.

You just missed Dr. Fischer's
Christening.

I know, I'm on my way now.

You've even got her doing
your lectures for you.

Well, it's her project now.

Don't wanna miss too much.

All right, Malcolm, nice to
see you.

computers,

time stamping information
our senses take in.

Nor are we adding machines
marking ones and zeroes

on a cerebral ledger.

There's something else.

Traits that mark us,
intelligence, anger, love,

do not define us.
[thunder rumbling]

For in isolation, these
fragments are course,

even unrecognizable.

But when they coexist in
a single consciousness,

something emerges.

Something material, yet
immaterial.

Dare I even say immeasurable.

Something called self.
