Now, it's screw up

Are you blind? Don't you see it?

That police blamed your sister-in-law

lt's his luck that l didn't kill him.

That's because you hate police,
why you say it's me?

Especially you.

l did it for you and you still complain me.

Are you complaining me?

No

You are here

Of course you say it's no different.

You didn't care anything

Don't say it

Hey!

Big brother, a police is fighting with us

What are you fighting for?

Big brother, he insults you

How did you hear this message?
That's what Leopard said

l cannot suffer what you said

Leopard said your driving
skill was poor.

He asked you not to go
to Tsimshatsui anymore

He also said you
dared not to race with him

That's what he said? What is his price?

Forty thousand dollars per person.

lf you agree, l can take care half of it.

You want to take advantage from me

Am l that kind of person?

Stop saying nonsense

l can't stop you if you want to die

lf you are interested,

You can pay my half first

Don't you trust me?

Don't say that

Let's fix it

l'll reply Leopard

Ok, go for it

Why didn't you help Bull
when he fought with somebody else?

l went to tell you

You could shout

What would happen if they fight?

You always shout if nothing happen

You are the same, Bull

You always fight with others
for minor points

They came for advantage that l agree.

What would happen
if we fight for other points?

This is our place

lt is hard to suffer

You always say it's hard to suffer.

Brother,
you remember mom liked sugar cake

Of course l remember

l will come to see you next year, mom.

Let's clean up, it's a mess.

No. l don't want to see that bastard.
Let's go

You wait me downstairs

OK

Dad

l'll be downstairs

Bastard

Ann, happy birthday

lt's not my birthday

You can call me at my store

No, you can go now

l don't want the bastard thinks that
l am talking about his faults

What?

What's it?

Birthday gift

Why did you take it from the bastard?

Are you jealous?

Watch out

lt's for fun

l would say you like to show off

l have nothing too proud of.

l only proud of my driving skill

You better kill me
if l am not allowed to race

You have said it ten thousand times.

Don't you eat everyday?

l will race at
Princess Margaret Road two days later.

Will you come?

l have seen it before, nothing special.

lt's not the same;
the bet will be forty thousand dollars

l let you to see
my driving skill more clearly.

Forty thousands?
Who is the opponent?

A racer of Explosion.

l don't know which one

Joe, let's work

You have been staring at your wife.
Didn't you stare enough?

Do you cough?

Why do you always drink this stuff?

Old Guy,
what you think about that racer?

No

What you mean by no

Explosion didn't ask you to be his racer

lt's only a game, no big deal

You don't have to race.
You can have money to buy new tire if we win.

What you think?

OK

We are doing business in this garage

These guys are not good nature.
We better not to deal with them

Put your hands off

Joe, you use to race

Now,
you have a chance to race with others

why don't you response?

lt is good if

l can race in Macao

Yes, let's go to Macao first,
then we go to Philippines

Yes, this is the way to do it

Joe, we opened this garage

Because we want to get fame in Macao

lt is good for business

Joe, you should show us your idea.

Don't ask me

The garage belongs to us.
l can't make decision

That's right

What's right?

OK, what are you fighting for?

The most important thing is
to test the car.

That bastard comes every week

He probably crashed on the way

Here he is

Let's start

That country boy
is driving a garbage truck and screwing around

Let's see his stuff

This monster seems OK.

Reverse slow tire

and slick tire,

The side vents are bigger than a table

lt is shame to race with this monster.

Don't play with him, let's go.

Joe, the car can't stand it.

They have reset the parts;

it's no way. Don't chase them.

l asked you not to go reluctantly

You didn't hear what l said.
Now, we blew up.

We lost everything;

the side vents have gone.

Brother, it's only testing.

Don't go too far. We don't need a hero

You never listen to me.

l will fix it

Let's go to gas station

We finish work today

lt seems that you must win

Hey

lt's great.

Your brother
has higher score than a movie star.

Sister-in-law

Lui, we must win

l don't know who is our opponent.

l've never heard about him

You've have never heard about him?

Do we have to give him 20% off?

Shut up

Must you win?

There is a space

Let move in

White, white!

lt's gone

Please

You like soft drink?

Explosion,
your racer doesn't want to show up

What is the use for coming early?

He doesn't want to show up
even though he can take advantage

Explosion

Here he comes

What you think?

Sure win

Don't lose my face

Hi

Do you know him?

No

Explosion, bring your racer here

Lui, this is Joe

l count you win
if you reach my taillight.

Don't say bullshit,
forty thousands per person

Give me money and let's race.
The final point is Wanchai Ferry

Give me money

Explosion didn't say
to cross the harbour tunnel

You can give up right now

Are you saying that
you want to give up?

l am scared that
l got no money even if l win.

Give me money. Give me money

Lui, give me money, half of it

Why do you pretend innocent?
We have a deal, you pay first.

Twenty thousands, twenty thousand

Let's get in the car.

We must win

Watch out, it's time for you to show off.

We must win

l believe so

Let's move.
Are you waiting the police? Hurry up.

Let's move.

Get ready

Let get in the car

Ready

Bastard, you want to go overhead?
Let's go to heaven together

No way, how did you drive?

What?

You crashed me?

Crash you?
l should ask you how did you drive

Why did you let me crash?

What? Arguing with me?

Did you follow the rule?

What rule?

What are you doing?

Don't fight. Don't fight

You blocked my way and crash me.
Should it be counted?

Why should it be counted?
lt's an accident. No count.

You said the final point is highway.
l am the winner

Don't be proud

My car is at front.
Your car is at rear. l am the winner

l don't care. You fix it yourself

Somebody is robbing my money

Police! Let's go

Let's go

Don't move

Stop saying nonsense

Sir, l went for a walk

You think that l am a nut.

Even though a nut knows
that you were racing

You have said it.
Only a nut thinks that l raced

Sir, you seem normal.
Don't look like a nut

What are you laughing at?

Sir, you have misunderstood me

Everybody laugh at the people
who is poor, not the ''Cheung''(hooker)

You got a ''Cheung''(gun );
we dare not to laugh at you.

Don't be slick

Don't fool around with me

l am talking to you.
Turn around and face to me

l am asking you

Do you have a hearing problem?
Uncle Fei

You better wait for my lawyer.
Take your times and enjoy your tea

This is police station. Behave yourself

You can charge me
if you have enough proof

You don't have to give me face

Bastard

Hey

Hey, you think that police got powers?

Don't do anything foolish

l will prosecute you

Don't stop me to teach my son.
You race illegally.

You get your sister arrested

lt is your business if you wanted to be
rotten, why did you implicate your sister?

Who race illegally?

Do you have proof?
You can't malicious accuse me.

Stop shouting

Your sister is angry with you

You want to play an act in the public?

OK, l play an act for you

You are suspected to race illegally,
we can arrest you.

What did you say?
Are you working in this region?

Do you have rights to charge me?

Shut up

Arrest this bastard

Hey...

l take all responsibility

Dad

Don't bet him, it only takes 48 hours

This is not the first time

You are great.
Before lCAC was set up

You are just a cop

You used to collect dirty money
with me when l was litter

Not to pay after eaten

Have you finished talking nonsense?

Not yet. Let me finish

Now there is lCAC

You pretend to be a good cop.
You arrest me when l collect dirty money

l learn it from you. Bastard

Send him to prison

You are afraid that l will say everything

Colleague, send him to prison

Go

l can go

Ann

Do you want to arrest me?

l am your dad

You don't want to arrest me?
Can l go now?

Brother

lf you think that
l will lead you to wrong way

You go home with him

What did you say?

l was wrong.
This matter will be never ended

You go to find Bull

He will take care of you.
You will be OK

Hmm...

Ann, l want to talk to you

l don't want to listen

Ann

lt's none of my business.
l know you want to teach your son

l regret to ask you to come.
l did expect you'd behave like this

l half opened my eyes

Now, his sister is involved in it

l must send him in prison
if l have power

You go first

Let's go

Stop the car. Stop the car

What?

l go to Mongkok.
Do we go at the same way?

No. Please start going.

Hey, what are you doing?

l can give you a ride even though
we are not the same way.

l have been waiting for long time

What happened?

Stink wants to frame me up?

We should fight individually.

Big brother,
Explosion's racer wanted to frame Ann up

Rely on you?
l was killed before you had come

You like him. Of course you say so

Ann

You go

Watch out

He argue with your brother

Don't shout

Big Brother, Stink crashed the car

You better do the right thing

Stink's car is very good.

He sent him home

You better shut up. Otherwise,
l am qualified to look down on you.

Remember, to see what he got

Have you finished playing?
The more you say, the more mistakes you make

You owe me money.
What about diagnose charge of my brothers?

What diagnose charge?

What? You beat my brothers;
don't you reimburse money to them?

OK, how much you want to get?

One price, fifty thousands

What? Why don't you go to rob?

Hey, we are just discussing, let's talk

Fifty thousands diagnose charge, l pay.

l start calculating with you

You scared my brothers

l ask for thirty thousands for medicine

But you took action
when l was not in site. You were too slick

l ask for fifty thousands.
You crashed my shop

l ask for two hundred thousand.
Reduce the fifty thousands

You still owe me two hundred
thousands dollars. When will you pay?

Bastard, you are fooling me

Can't l fool you?

Stink, you don't have to be angry

You use to act irately

How can you be a boss?

No wonder your followers are so bad

Big brother, the car is on fire

Put out the fire

lt explores

Fuck it. To burn my car!

Are you blind?
l was discussing with you

Don't be blat! l can stand it.

What did you say?

l know you got lots of enemies.

You are genius

Put out the fire

You always talk nonsense

We better talk about it

Let's talk. l am afraid that you don't talk.

Let's go

Police is coming

Don't go. Stay where you are

What are you doing here?

Nothing

We were drinking in the shop

We came out when
we saw the car was on fire

The car was on fire? Whose car it is?

Sir? That guy is in a fury.

l don't know whether it's his car.

Which one?

The one who dressed in black?

The one who dressed in black?

ls that your car?

No, l don't know what has happened

l come out to take a look

Do you know whose car it is?

He stole that car. He will be in trouble

You have guts.
Aren't you afraid my brother?

l show my thankful for mercy.
l would like to give myself to you

Let get off and take a look.

ls this new?

What? Are you tired of it?

This is my first time

lf l knew it before, l didn't have
to pretend innocent for such long time

l also don't like it

There is one thing you must like it

Let's take a look

Ladies and gentlemen,
l sing this song for a woman

She is importance to me

The woman is my mother. What is the reason?

Why do l sing this song for her?

Because l would like to tell her

l met a beautiful girl

You can ask me to do anything
by phone call

You don't have to come here
by yourself. Brother Bing.

l would like to clarify
everything face to face.

l heard that you had
some argument with Stink

l tried to discuss with him.
However, Stink...

l don't care who's right

l spoke with his big brother

You burnt his car. You owe him...

l owe him?

Listen to me.
l know you are a hot-tempered man.

l will pay. Money is not important

His followers got hurt.
He wanted you to hand out the bastard

What about he beat our guys?

You talk to me like that?

l beat his followers

You can send me to him

No. To give money is not a proper way

You still want me to hand out my guys?
What a jerk he is?

Are you a new guy?

How can you define who's right?

We should say
who's in a better situation.

You got shop and reputation

You will meet general public

Getting money is
better than anything else . Stupid

lt's no way
if you ask me to hand out my guys.

l got a message.

There is guy who named Joe

That one?

Stink won't accept him even
if l hand him out

We have compromised everything.
He just wants to have face

Moreover, he beat the guy.

He saved my sister once.

Why so trouble?
To hand out our guy is not the right way.

Now, they accept anyone. Let's do it.

Don't say it anymore. Let's do it

l hope Bull will win credit in the future.
He can't rely to others when he makes mistake

He can't win credit

What can you expect him?

Bull follows me since
he was twenty years old.

He will ruin himself
if l don't take care of him

Don't touch me. l am not in mood

When the time we met each other,
you never said in mood.

What's happened?

You never satisfy

Now l am not satisfied

Don't touch me

You go to Stink's car park right now

Do you know the location?

l know. Brother Bing

OK

Brother

Yes?

Was Joe beaten?

He is just a garage guy,
why are you so nervous?

Garage guy? He saved me once

ls it true of what he said?

Shut up

Did Bull tell you anything?

Brother, he never touched me

l know. l would kill him if he did.

Why are you doing this?

Am l your brother?

l am asking you the reason

What reason?
Don't ask me if you treat me as your brother

lt is no use for being softly.

You have to treat me good

l asked you to shut up

lt is my business. You leave me alone

Where are you going?

l go and have a look

l go with you

Ann, Ann

lt is closed. You come tomorrow

Damn

Hey

Go to hell

Big Brother, lt is for you

Big brother

Ann, they are coming. You go with them

Joe

This is the one

lt is Bull's car

Joe

Joe

Joe

Don't touch me. Get lost

Put him against the wall

Oh

We can't help

You can go now

Ann, you know it very well

Sorry, l didn't know you are bathing

Don't be sorry. You have no guts

Thank you for sending me home
and clean up everything

l did it because l got bored.
l don't need you say thank you

lt is no use to say it

We both know
what kind of person l am

What kind of person? You tell me

Can't you say?

You have no guts.
You are afraid of my brother, right?

Ann, stop the car

Ann, get dressed. Let's go

Otherwise, it's too late.
You didn't go home last night

Your brother is looking for you.
He will come here very soon.

l can't imagine if he see you like this

He will know sooner or later

Not under this circumstance.

You better go. Thank you for telling me

You know what to do

l asked you if you knew
Ann's whereabouts. You said you didn't know

Don't bother them

l don't need your lecture. Get lost

We will be finished if you hit me

Sister-in law, our brothers are here

How can you say something
on behalf of outsider?

Shut up

OK, you are sister-in-law;
l am a small potato. l shut up

Enough

Enough. l won't let you blame my guys.

You beat him.
What else you want to do?

There are two different things.

lt's no way he can touch my sister

Your sister is voluntary.

Bastard,
you said my sister voluntary to undress.

l will come back to you for this

Bastard

No. What are you doing?

Police. Stop. Step aside

Bastard. Stop fighting

Don't stop me

What are you doing?

Get out of the way

Don't do anything stupid

Damn you.
Don't touch my sister anymore

l tell you

Bastard. What are you doing?
Don't fight

Your daughter was fucked, bastard

lt is not right to beat him

Not right. Everything l do is not right

My sister was fucked.

Let's not talk about your sister.
l got a message

You crashed his car

and sent him for beaten.

You are diffident

You can say whatever you like

You can falsely accuse me.
Police has powers

As a matter of fact,
you destroyed our garage

Police are here. Let them do their jobs

Can't you hear?

He's his dad. No wonder he is so fierce

What are you talking about?

Don't move.
l'll fight with you if you move

l tell you. l feel pity for you this time

You can accuse him.

l will act with justice

Joe, accuse him. Don't be afraid

l don't want to

What? Joe?

He said he didn't want to.
Can't you hear, bastard?

You beat him and you are fierce to him?

Shut up

Don't do anything silly.

Let's go

Go. You want to be arrested 48 hours?

Ann, let's go.

Why are you afraid of him?

There are police, accuse him

Stop it.

Fellow, l don't care what are you doing?

You don't touch my daughter

Police threaten me

You can change your mind.
You have right to accuse him

Ann, where are you going?

l won't go there anymore.

l am afraid that you will break his arm

You don't trust your brother

l dare not

He is not a good guy

l know what kind of person he is

Ann,
You like to voluntary to give yourself.

Go. Go.

He is playing game with you.

He and l have some conflict.
You don't know he is playing game.

You are playing game with me.

l dare not to see him anymore.
Are you happy now?

l care about you

Thank you so much

Are you angry with me

because of that fellow?

l am not angry with you.
l just can't stand it. Dad is right

Don't mention about that bastard

Go

l don't go

Don't play an act in front of him

What did you say?

What?

Bastard

Don't fight

Ann! Bastard!

Go! l know that you don't want me

l have told you that it is very troubled
if we race illegally

Old Guy, it is none of my business.

He got the trouble himself

l came here this morning
and saw the garage had been destroyed

l worried about him.

l didn't expect that
he be in bed with his girlfriend

He was cheated and knew nothing

l don't see
why he came with so many policemen

We have to do business

l would say you are afraid.
l will get to the root of the matter.

You always stick to him.
Now you have got a lesson.

That bastard won't die a nature death

l would throw him out of window

when he was little if l knew he did that

Won't you stop blaming?
You always blame him

Brother turned bad is because of you.

Stop the car. l want to get off

Ann, where are you going?

Ann! Bastard!

What game you are playing?
You took away everything

You never return my call

l am not playing game.
We are finished

What did you say?

You never treated me as your girlfriend.

Why do you come here?

l didn't treat you as my girlfriend?

You can die for your guys

You can go to hell for your sister.

Did you do anything for me?

l bumped the police. Can you deny it?
l didn't do anything for you?

Bump the police? lt is because you hate police

You never do what ever l ask you to do

You never respect me.

You don't care about me

Why should l go with you?

You lift up my dress
when you are happy

When you are unhappy, you will
kick me away even l take off my panty

l am also a human being.
You think about it

Katy

Hurry up

What?

Syrup is arguing
with Explosion and Lui

Why don't they wait for me?

You want to play game?

Here comes the big boss.
l thought that he dared not to come

What are you boosting?

Shut up

Don't talk nonsense. Sit

Sit down

Lui, they are so fierce.
How can we talk?

ls it possible to talk?

l am listening

Lui, no matter who's right

l don't want to argue with you.
The issue started with a racing

lt is very simple.
We race one more time

Joe, are you nut?

OK, l give you one more chance

You get lost
and not to touch my sister anymore

Otherwise, l will kill you

l don't care about you.

We can only thousands dollars
even if we win

What's about my garage?
How much you should pay me back?

You dislike the small amount?
Let's do a bigger bet

Three hundred thousand dollars.
You better give up if you have no guts.

What?

Syrup

Don't stop me if we are friends

Three hundred thousand? lt's not enough.
Let's bet five hundred thousand

Syrup

Do you threaten me?

Yes. What you think?

OK, let's bet five hundred thousand

Everybody is watching me.

We are not friends if you stop me

What are you doing? Get out

Go

Get out

You are so impressive.
You negotiate with so many people

To negotiate in restaurant is not
in fashion anymore

Bastard, you are outdated

You better watch your mouth

lf your sister didn't call me

l wouldn't come here

in the middle of night.

Girlfriend doesn't want you.

Sister is angry with you.
You better quit

What are you talking about? Sir

Don't pretend innocent.
My supervisor has your file

Don't think that it doesn't matter.
You are used and you

might be charged implication

lt's none of your business.
Can l go now?

Don't complain that l am not helping.
l hope you can be out of trouble

Big brother, what happened?

When you negotiate with somebody,
you should discuss with me first

l can't suffer

Can't suffer!
You have to get a result like this?

l patch up a quarrel.

But you act like a big hero

To bet five hundred thousand.
You think that you are play monopoly?

You have to pay him everything
if you lose

Must we lose?

Must we win?

l pay everything if we lose.

l can't let him take advantage

You like to...

l like it. What?

Old Guy, don't talk with him. Let's go

What happen now?

Hey, are we brothers?

Bastard.

We are brothers when nothing happens.
You kick me away when something gets wrong

We have to park the car

You are playing game with me

This is my last time to tell you

l won't be your brother
if you bring disaster again

Fat Dog, the drugs are in that car.

You go and take it. Be careful

Big brother, your dad

Stop the car, bastard

Big brother, don't get off.

Get away

Big Brother

Don't care about me.
You go home first. Don't wait for me

Dad, dad, open the door.

Dad, dad, are you alright?

Damn

Are you alright?

When will you be a good guy?

l want to correct you

You will be finished

l can half open my eyes

if your file is in my hand.
Do you understand?

Dad, dad.

Mr. Lui Yiu Wing rests

Holy Father, Holy Son and Holy Spirit,

Can we wait a moment?

Sorry

Brother Bing. l want to quit

Don't be childhood.
l know you r dad is dead

You feel guilty. But what will you do

if you don't work for me?

l will work in the garage

Aren't you satisfying
the present situation?

Your racing skill is perfect.

You have your followers.
We know how you live

if you don't work for me anymore.

Brother Bing

What?

Didn't you say you

l am drinking with you

What happened? Lui?

You better think about it

OK, let's play

l am a good-hearted person.

You better talk frankly

Your dad...

Thank you for asking

l called you. l know you moved out
from your brother's place

You are so clever.
No wonder you called Katy

How long do you want to hide?

l don't know what you are talking about

You think that you have characteristic?

We are mutual.
l don't care to sleep with you, why you should?

Let's talk

Get off your hands

l won't get off my hands
if you don't say it clearly

You want to play an act in the public?

Yes,
l would like to play an act in the public.

So what? You said l had no guts at first

Now l get guts and you want to quit.

You want to play game with me?
l will go right now if you say yes

Answer me. Why don't you answer me?

l am afraid my brother will beat you

Let me kiss

Are you nut?

lt is because l am in love with a nut

l will race with your brother

l will start my own life
and won't race anymore

Big brother, will you play?

Would you like to join us?

No, you play

Hurry up
