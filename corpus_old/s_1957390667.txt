[News Reporter] A
man burned to death

at Pablo Psychiatric Hospital.

The hospital claims the patient

had no extraneous materials
needed to start a fire,

and no such materials
were found at the site.

Local investigators say
all the evidence points out

that the victim was
burned from within,

an uncommon phenomenon
known as self-combustion.

The local priest working
with the patient informed us

the patient claimed to
be possessed by a spirit.

The priest is quoted, saying,

there is no natural explanation
for something like this.

I have failed him.

Yay, did you make a good wish?

All right, who wants cake?

Yay, cake!

[singing in foreign language]

[speaking in foreign language]
Daddy! Can I go to the pool?

[speaking in foreign language]
Yes, but be careful.


look at that hair.

I just love it.

It's going great.

I'm working with this new
artist out of New York.

It's incredible but,
he's very superstitious.

He only paints on
odd numbered days.

That's strange.

Religious thing, I don't know.

But I'm telling you,

he could be famous

if I could just get him
to focus and finish.

Religious or lazy?
Exactly.

Yeah.

I'm gonna get a cookie.

So, how is Derek
handling your hours.

Amazingly well, at least
that's what he tells me.

I don't know, how
do you deal with it?

[ominous music]

[women screaming]
[water splashing]

[speaking in foreign language]

Cora!

Cora!

Oh my God.
Cora.

Cora, are you okay?

What happened?
What happened?

I don't know.

I find Cora in the water.

I pulled her out.

It's okay, I was just
playing a joke on you guys.


Fake drowning is not
funny and you know it.


Look, you scared
us half to death.

She's fine.

Come on, sweetie.

Oh, come on.
Did she hit her head, Leo?

Did you see?
Sorry, I didn't.

Thank you.

[melancholy music]

Thank God it's over.

I'm exhausted.

it on, I like it.

I shouldn't have
gotten so mad.


She scared me, too.

Maybe she wanted
to be rescued by Leo.

You mean she
did it on purpose?

Maybe.

I don't know, if she's
anything like I was,

we are in so much trouble.

Tell me about it.

Mm, this is so good.

Where'd you get it?


No.

Must have been Marta.

[glass clanking]

[fire igniting]

[ominous music]

I'm surprised so many
of the neighbors came.

Especially the ones
across the street.

It's nice.
Yeah.

[heavy footsteps thudding]

[suspenseful music]

I sure do love you.

[door closing]

[ominous music]

[sparks sizzling]

[door closing]

Cora.

Come on hun.

Wake up, we're late, chop chop.

Hun, can you make sure she's up?

Cora, let's go, honey.

You gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

I have no idea what
today looks like.

[ominous music]

Oh my God, Derek.

[tense music]

What the hell happened?

It's brand new.

Power surge, or
electrical short?

I don't know.

The whole house
could have burned down.

You should get going.

I'll call on the fridge.
Okay.

Are you sure?

Yeah, it's under warranty.

They'll have to replace it.

Wow.
[dark music]

Cora, let's go.

Come on, we're late.

Let's go, go go go.

Breakfast.

I'm not hungry.

You will be.

Okay.

Backpack.

Apple is in your
bag for later, okay?

Bye.

Have a good day.

Let's go.

[suspenseful music]

Right, but this is from
the Sternoff Collection.

I've got this cache of
neo-realism beauties.

All European.

What else you got?

Picked up a couple I
think you might like.

This new artist.

No, this new artist
I'm telling you about,

he's incredible.


Variety, Christian, iconic.

No, I am telling you, he
is the next Walkdorfski.

Get in early on this guy.

[phone ringing]

All right, I'm
getting another call.

I gotta take this, okay?

All right, bye.

Hey babe.

want to do for dinner tonight?

Do you want to go out?

Sounds good.

Cor, you want to go out?

Cora?

Uh, maybe not.

Maybe we'll stay home
and watch a movie.

You sure?
Yeah, kind of.

What do you think, veggie pizza?

I'll let you get veggie.

Uh, pepperoni and black olive.

[tense music]

[whimsical music]

She's not coming down.

She says she isn't hungry.

What?
Yeah.

It's early.

This is her favorite show.

I know.

When did she become
a moody teenager?

Boys.

You saw how awkward
she was around Leo.

Yeah, he better watch it.

[crickets chirping]

[door opening]

[items clanging]

[suspenseful music]

[mirror cracking]

[thud roaring]

Oh my God.

What the hell was that?

Stay here.

No.

[suspenseful music]


Cora?

Oh.
Oh my goodness.

You hit your head.

I'm okay.


Let's get up on your bed here.


Okay.

Oh.
Oh, hey.

Oh, it's okay.
Hey.

Hey, it's all right.

Bad dream.
I'm okay.

see, let me see.

Oh.

Up.

Down.

Down.

Left.

Right.

Great.

[speaking in foreign language] Tell me, did she have
previous concussions?

[speaking in foreign language]
No.

No.

I donâ€™t know.

Allergic reactions to
medications?

No.

Well... We can do
a CT scan... if you want.

we are ready for you.

[light dramatic music]

This patient's alive?

her walk into the room.

But it might have changed.

The machine has malfunctioned.

after the first round,

it's working fine.

No it's not.

Let's run her again.

[dramatic music]

[people chattering]

[speaking in foreign language]
Whiskey?

Whiskey?

[speaking in foreign language]
Want to tell?

One patient, a girl.
Her CT is the same as...

Will you be able to help her?

The second shot was normal.

Hmmm... that's it.

How are you?

My affairs?

Nobody asks the bartender
about his business.

They tell him theirs.

Cheers.

Hey.

[ominous music]

It's okay.

[phone ringing]

Hello?


Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.


How come you're not at work?

Shoot.

What time is it?


I overslept again.
It's crazy.

The police are here.

A lady went through the window.

The little girls
parents were pissed.

First her cat scans
kept changing,

then she is in the
room with a jumper,

and they took the girl home.

Stop talking, please.

I'll be right in.


Thank you, Darya.

[light suspenseful music]

Sorry.

There you are.
Oh, hey.

What the hell is going on?

I've been interrogated.

Can you imagine?

First time in my life.

They've been asking me
all those questions.

Did I see anything?

Did I hear anything?

[dramatic music]

[phone ringing]

Hello, can I speak
with Mr or Mrs Walters?


Cora Walters' father.


This is Nina
from the hospital.

I just wanted to check
in on your daughter.

How is she?

saw that woman commit suicide.

I'm so sorry
about what happened.

These incidents can be
very traumatic for a child.

I would like to come
over for a formal visit.

Is it okay?

Sure.

[speaking in foreign language] Kolya, hey!... I told you!
Hey... whatâ€™s this!...

[speaking in foreign language] Whatâ€™s going on?
This is a mess!

You... come in... Sorry!

Come on, pick it up!
Well, we have taps.

Well, and who pays?
Itâ€™s from your salary.

[tense music]

What have I got to do with it?
I'm just stuck, that's all.

[gate bell ringing]

You can! Come on! Hey!...
Ok.

[suspenseful music]

[doorbell ringing]

Hi, I'm Nina,
from the hospital.

Oh, oh, please come in.

I'm so sorry
about what happened.

Oh, thank you.

After the incident, we
kind of left in a hurry.

We didn't feel comfortable
leaving Cora there.

I understand.

Can I see Cora's
release documents?

Oh, yes.

Cat scan is.

This is Nina
from the hospital.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

Should we sit?

Please.

So, hysteria is
a form of neurosis

in which emotional disturbances

can turn to physical problems.

It could be related
with family stress,

death of a family member.

Is anyone in your family ill?

No.
No.

Then it could be hereditary.

Any history of mental illness?

Not that we know of.

No.

Then, it could be, as
we call it, free floating.

Which means it has
no particular reason.

Has Cora any kind
of strange behaviors

after she left the hospital?

[tense music]


Let me show you.

[tense music]

Wow that's.

She's a very sweet girl.

This isn't like her.

Does she walk in
her sleep often?

No, not at all.

Not that I know of.

Well, this could be
[speaking in foreign language],

a night terror.

What's that?

A night terror is having
feelings of intense fear

in the middle of the night.

Relatively common but
usually at a younger age.

The child appears to be awake,

but actually they
are in a dream state.

They don't understand
what they are doing.

So what do you
recommend we do.

Right now, observation.

We're not taking her
back to the hospital.

Actually, it's
better for the patient

to see him in his
everyday environment.


Yes.

would observe her?

I can.

If you're okay with that.

Cora, do you like
Ukrainian food?


you to work in Ukraine?

My grandparents
were Ukrainian.


I was born in the States

but we visited here a
lot when I was a kid.

One time I liked it so much
I just decided to stay.

background, exactly?

Kiev, in Bogomolets University.

Then I worked in a sleep clinic

for a few years in
the United States.

And then I came back to Ukraine.

Why'd you come back?

I thought I could help
more people working here,

in a hospital.

And I got frustrated
by the sleep clinics.

They observe patients
only in the clinic,

but when it comes to sleep
disorders, that's ineffective.

You need to see the patients

in their everyday
sleeping environment.

Cora, we've
invited Nina to stay.

She's gonna.
I know.

She's gonna watch
me while I sleep.

[ominous music]

All of these paintings
were here when we came.

Which, some of them
are very beautiful.

Some of them, really good.

Yeah, yeah.

It was kind of cool to
see them when we moved in.

And towels for the bathroom.

Thank you.
Mm-hm.

It's usually pretty
warm in here,

but if you need another
blanket, they're in the closet.

Can I get you anything else?

I'm fine, thank you.

Okay.

Have a good night.

I'll see you in the morning.

See you tomorrow.

[sullen music]

[water guggling]

[sullen music]

[children playing]

[Child Voiceover] Mom.

[sharp ominous music]

[Nina gasps]

It's okay.

It's okay.

Did you go into the wrong room?

Come on, sweetie.

[music box playing]
[child giggling]

[light footsteps running]

[child laughing]

[suspenseful music]

[music box playing]
[light footsteps running]

[child giggling]

[door closing]

Cora.

Nina?

What's going on?

How was Cora?

At around 3:00, Cora
came into my room.

She just stood there, staring.

She was sleepwalking?

Maybe.

And honestly, I never seen
anything quite like this.

So, what do we do now?

I recommend more observation.

The hospital needs a report and,

before I know more, I'm
not sure what to tell them.

[tense music]

[dramatic music]

[speaking in foreign language]

[doorbell ringing]

Hey, come on in.

Get you set up upstairs.

What have you got in here?

Cameras.

I also put a camera in the
hall so I can watch her.

Night terrors occur

between stages three and
four of the sleep cycle.

At that point, your body's
temperature continues to decline

as you head over to REM sleep.

If the temperature is prevented
from dropping properly,

it can trigger a night terror.

That's why I gave Cora
a lighter blanket,

and hopefully she'll agree to
wear it with thinner pajama.

Do night terrors
run in your family?

I have no idea, why?

Usually it's hereditary.

Has Cora had any
anesthesia recently?

No.

Maybe she takes any medication
like asthma or allergy?

Not that I know of, why?

Just all possible causes.

And, we are on.

[chilling music]

I thought Cora was
at home already.

She's at school.

[door closing]

oh, they're here.

Hey, how was school?

As her.

set up out, it's pretty cool.

Okay.

Okay go, upstairs.

office if you need me.

[ominous music]

Hey, how's it going?

Wow.

Has Cora had any trouble
adjusting to a new country?

[marker scribbling]

Well, with the school
changes here and the house.

Anything that might
cause an anxiety.

She likes it here.

I mean, it's obviously been

a bit more stressful
lately, but.

Derek said you
work long hours.

Yeah.

How that goes, that makes
an impact in your household.

Problems with your marriage?

No.

I'm just trying to
get a clear picture

of Cora's home life.

We're happily married.

[tense music]

[sharp ominous music]
[marker scribbling]

[sharp ominous music]

I know we joke about it,

but do my long hours bother you?

I don't know, what's
the right answer?

I can see that one
going either way.

The honest one.

I miss you, but sometimes
it's good to miss someone.

Do you still think I'm hot?


Prove it.

I said, prove it.

Prove what?

Prove that you
still think I'm hot.

Hm.

Wait.

Are there camera's in here?

Are we being watched?

No.

Wait, microphones?

Can she hear us?

I don't think so.

[Derek scaring Jennifer]

Stop.
[Derek laughs]

I don't want her to hear us.

Oh, who cares?

I do.

Let's be loud.

Make her jealous.

[crickets chirping]

[people whispering]

[ominous music]

[ominous music]

[suspenseful music]

Cora?

Cora.

Are you okay, honey?

[ominous music]

[child giggling]

[music box playing]

[light footsteps running]

[Nina gasps]


What happened?


Don't tell your parents, okay?

Okay.

This will be our little secret.

[eerie music]

[appliance rattling]

good this morning.

How'd it go last night.

It was, well it
can be some nebulism,

or sleepwalking as
you said, but unsure.

There are many possibilities

and they're difficult
to determine.

Okay.

Jennifer, please be patient.

It just takes time.

I'll talk to Cora and
try to make a connection.

See you tonight.

[melancholy music]

[knocking on door]

[door opening]


Yeah, sure.

Which doll is this?

Is this one?

No.

Is it me?


[ominous music]

Wanted to see your drawings.

Can I look?

Do you want to be an artist?

Maybe.

Probably one day,

your father will be
selling your paintings.

Maybe.

Do you miss having
your mom around?

Kind of, but it's
not a big deal.

Oh, you have a teddy bear.

He protects you?

It's a stuffed animal.

True.

But it has a meaning behind it.

I have one and I
believe he protects me.

Maybe.

I have a great idea.

Follow me, come on.

[tense music]

Oh, I'm not
allowed to have soda.

My mom doesn't let me.

Let's break the rules
for tonight, okay?

Okay.

And, we're gonna
have a fancy dinner.

Just the two of us.

So we need some fancy glasses.

Let's taste it.

And.

Cheers.
Cheers.

I need to show you something.

Okay.

Is it food?

No.

Then what is it?

[Nina humming]

[door closing]

And now I play yours.


Nothing.

We're having a fancy dinner.

Do you want to join us?

Yeah, looks like fun.

Is this soda?

I love soda.

I told you that
was a good idea.

I love these too,
did you get these?


We use them as feet.
[eerie music]

As your feet?

Bad dancing.
Hey.

Where you going?

I'm going to bed now.

Well it was good to see
her smile for a second.

Yeah.

Bloop.

I think you can eat it now.

I think I'd like
some real wine.

You?


[ominous music]

[Derek laughing]

like half of it.

I just like strawberry.

Yeah, I could tell.

Want some more?

Yes, please.

So, how is your art
dealing business going?

It's fine,

I'm just trying to figure out

what to do with
ruined paintings.


[suspenseful music]

not much to decide.

Pretty well destroyed.


To be honest,

half of this work
was trash anyways.

[both laughing]

Oh my God, cheers.

Don't tell them I said that.

What's going on?

Where's Cora?

She just went to bed.

I'll go check on her.

Goodnight.

You gonna offer me a glass

of whatever it is
you're drinking?


You bet.

[tense music]

How was your day?



[tense music]

Do you like her?

Yeah.

I mean not like that.

I like what she's
doing for Cora.

She was great with her.

You should have
seen her tonight.

Aw, is someone jealous.

Stop.

Come on, where is
this coming from?

Where is this coming from?

I have a stranger
living in my house

with my husband and my daughter,

having fancy dinners
and drinking wine

and doing God knows what
else while I'm at work.

Oh my gosh.

Come on, that's ridiculous.

You think this is funny?

Yeah. [chuckles]

Okay, yeah.

While you're at work,

I'm having an affair
with the specialist.

While our daughter sleep
walks around the house,

ruining my paintings.

Don't mock me.

Asshole.

[ominous music]

[sparks sizzling]

[door creaking lightly]

[door opening]

[eerie music]

[tense music]

Hey, what, what are we doing?

She just pulled a bunch
of stuff out of the closet.

I don't.
Cora?

Go get her, yeah.

Cora?

She's not here.

She isn't there.

Where is she?

Nina.

Nina, wake up!

Where's Cora?

Oh shoot.

What time is it?

[water splashing]

Oh my God.

[tense music]

Cora, hey!

Cora.

Oh my God!

Oh my god.

Get her.

I can't get her.

head, watch her head.


Cora, breathe.

mouth, breathe into her mouth.

[speaking in foreign language]

Oh my God, Cora.

Please.

Please, breathe.

I think she's sleeping now.

All right, I'll be back.

How could you fall asleep?

I'm sorry.

She could have died.

I know, I'm sorry.

It will never happen again.

Get out.

Get the hell out of my house.

I want her gone.

Okay.
Tonight.

Get out.

Hey, Cora can hear you, quiet.

[melancholy music]

Hey.

Hey, I need to go.

I'm sorry.

He will protect you.

[ominous music]

[door creaking]

[ominous music]

[speaking in foreign language] - Anton!
Sorry, we are closed.

Ah, itâ€™s you.

I need a drink.

Can I offer you
something special?

Thirty years of whiskey,
cures everything.

Soft, fragrant.

Youâ€™ll like it!

At the expense of the
institution.

Will you give me ice?

This one is just clean.

Bad day?

Can I have more?

[sirens blaring]

[tense music]

[door opening]

[train rumbling]

[dog barking]

[child whispering]

[suspenseful music]

[sharp ominous music]

I just want, I just,

I'm just talking to you.

[Nina screams]

Stop, stop.

I'm just.

[Nina whimpering]

I'm sorry if I hurt you.

I, I didn't want to.


Did you draw this?

That's none of your business.


A young girl.

Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you.

Please, wait, wait.

This girl is in danger.

What are you talking about?

If you care for her,
you will hear me out.

I'm a priest.

Why should I believe you?

the enemy for years.

The enemy?

Evil.

It's not just a coincidence

that I happened to
see these drawings.

I've seen this picture before.

This is not just a drawing.

This is a demons face.

One of the Devil's disciples.

The Devil creeps up on us
in many different ways.

Through dark thoughts,
visions, dreams, nightmares.

Tell me about this young girl.

You must help her.

They're still not answering.

Why do you keep plastic fish?

What?

Your fish.

They're dead, soulless.

Turn right, up ahead.

[tense music]

[drawers falling]

[sparks sizzling]

[furniture rattling]

[furniture slamming]

[glass shattering]

[Cora screaming]

No.
Cora!

No, what the hell?

Cora.
[furniture rattling]

[Cora screaming]

Cora.
Help!

It burns.

It burns.
You're okay, you're okay.

No, help, help.
We're right here.

You're okay, we got you.
Help.

Hey hey hey.
Calm down.

[creature hisses]

[creature growling]

Cora.

Cora.

[tense music]

Cora?

Cora?

[creature growls]

Oh!


[creature growls]

You okay?

[creature growls]

Cora, what are you?

Ah!

I don't see her.

Cora, Cora no!


[Derek grunting]

Let go, Cora, let go.

[creature growling]

Oh my God.

Leave me alone!
[Derek grunting]

Come on, come on.
Put her down.

[tense music]


Cora, we're here.
Help.

[tense music]

Get her down, get her down.

Help.

it's mom and dad, Cora.


[Father Andrey] Move, move.


[Father Andrey] Hold her down.


Push.

You.

Drunk failure.

Go back to London, throw
yourself off a bridge.

Maybe it'll work this time.

Oh, look who's back.

Why don't you go spend time
with your real daughter.

Oh, that's right, you
can't, she's dead.

Cora, please.

And who's fault
is that? [laughs]

Shut up, mom.

You God damn liar.

Cora, stop.

Get your hands off me.

You're not my real father.

Who are you?

[demon laughs]


Is that your name?


Cora.

Oh, Cora.

[sharp eerie music]

Do you have a daughter?

What?

A daughter.

Do you have a daughter?

Yes, but she died a long time.

How did she know that?

She knows about me, too.

What's happening to her?

Is she gonna be okay?

She has a fever, that's good.

She's fighting.

Take her to the bed
to get some rest,

and get a cold compress
to cool her off.

Okay, I got her.
Go quick.

I got her.
Take her.

[Jennifer crying]



He knows what he's doing.

Come on.

Sit down, sit down.

She'll be okay.

[haunting music]

How do you know him?

I,

we.

This is Alexander.

How do you know him?

We.

We don't have time
for this, tell me.

He.

Is Derek Cora's father?

Please don't tell Derek.

It happened right before we met.

I didn't want to tell him.

I didn't want to lose him.

She's all right.

She's resting.

What do we need to do?

We do what's best
for you daughter.

I know the demon is inside her.

I can get it out.

The church has criteria that
must be met for me to do this,

but there is no time.

I can help her.

You must believe me.

[haunting music]

Courage the change
the things I can,

and the wisdom to know
the difference, amen.

[dark music]

How nice of you
to stay with me.

Do you want to see her?

Take me to her.

[haunting music]

[child playing]

[light footsteps running]

â™ª Na na â™ª

â™ª Your fault â™ª

â™ª It's all your fault â™ª

â™ª It's all your fault â™ª

â™ª It's all your fault â™ª

â™ª Your fault, your fault â™ª

â™ª It's all your fault â™ª

â™ª It's all your fault â™ª

Don't listen to the
demon, he lies to you.

[Nina crying]

[door slamming]

[doorknob jiggling]


Open the door!
Open the door.

Unlock the door.
Open the door.


It's not working.

Unlike the door.
I can't.

Do you still have my
cameras in her room?

Do you still have my
cameras in her room?

Yeah, I think so.

Right here.

Oh, come on.

Here we go.

You noticed your presence
here violates the church.

They threw you out like trash.

You lack in faith.

You have no power here.

Church law clearly points out

that recitation in no way
effects the order of power.

I can give you true power.

Just tell me what you
want, I'll give it to you.

I can give you everything.

Come on, just say the words.

You can get whatever you want.

Oh, is it the body you want?

Is it the girl?

Well too bad, she's mine.

Oh.

My baby.

this home for generations.

And I will not leave her body
until she bears me another

and my home is rebuilt.

I cast you out,
unclean spirit,

along with every
Satanic you have,

every scepter from hell
and your fallen companions

in the name of our
Lord, Jesus Christ.

And stay far away from
this creature of God.

Run from this place.

Fermenter of discord.

[demon growls]

Author of pain and sorrow.

Why then do you stand and
resist knowing as you must

that Christ the Lord brings
your plans to nothing.

[demon growls]

[priest chattering]
[intense music]

Burn, burn. [laughs]

[Father Andrey]
Crucify his name,

yet triumph over
the powers of hell.

Be gone then, in the
name of the Father,

of the Son, and
the Holy Trinity.

Be blessed to the Holy Spirit

by the sign of the holy cross
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

Lord.

[Father Andrey] I command
you, tell me your name,

wicked one.

[demon growls]

[intense music]

Open the door!

Open this door!

Cora!

Derek, help me!

Help me open the door!

Cora!

Come on, open the door!

Derek!

I now command you
to tell me your name!

Heretherefore in fear, Satan!

Enemy of the faith, give
me your name, name, name!

[demon growls]

I must burn what was left of

So, what do we do now?

You're okay baby,
I got you, I got you.

Okay, you're okay.

I got you, I got you.

[tense music]

I think the spirit
was toying with me.

What do you mean?

When I touched Cora, she
took me to somewhere else.

I was in my flat and I
could hear my daughter.

Your daughter
watches you from above.

She's in a good place.

I don't know, is she?

That was my fault.

I saw that cat scan and I knew
that something was not right,

but they told me she'll be okay.

I never got to say goodbye.


Take me back to Cora.

I'm fine.

I'm just hot.

Leave me alone.

I can't live within you.

You are not blood.

or you and she will die.

I won't let you kill her.

Alexander destroyed my body.

It's only right that
I should be able

to stay in his daughter.

If I burn the bones.

Wait, please, there.

They will take care of her,
ma'am.

Try to calm down.

Everything will be fine.

They won't let me in.

What are they saying?

They're telling
us to wait out here.

[tense music]
