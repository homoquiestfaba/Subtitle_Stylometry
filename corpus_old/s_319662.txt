Are you ready to give up your own
lives forever, for the spices?

To never love anyone but the spices?

I am, First Mother. I know the rules.

Mistresses, I have taught you all I can.

We must now decide where you are to go.

<i>Paris.</i>

<i>London.</i>

<i>Nairobi.</i>

Los Angeles.

<i>Hong Kong.</i>

<i>Toronto.</i>

<i>San Francisco.</i>

<i>There's a need for you in all these places.</i>

You will not burn.

<i>You will not feel pain.</i>

You will wake up in your new home
free of all your own desires.

But if a mistress fails her duty...

the spices will punish her.

<i>I love being a mistress of spices.</i>

<i>The spices are my love.</i>

<i>I know their origins, colors,</i>
<i>smells, their magic powers.</i>

<i>Yes, the old, old magic.</i>

<i>Every spice has a purpose.</i>

<i>And for each person, there's a special spice.</i>

<i>I am named Tilo...</i>

<i>after the sesame seed...</i>

<i>the spice of nourishment.</i>

<i>But here no-one knows who I am.</i>

Ladyjaan?

Yes, Haroun?

Ah! Ladyjaan.

Ah, please!

I am sick of old lady Kapadia.

These rich Indians,
they think they're still in India.

They treat us like animals.

Do this, that. Drive me here, there.
Not even a nod of thanks.

Ladyjaan, you must read my fortune today.

Haroun...

you know I can't read your for...
Yes, but Ahmed said.

You helped him get a green card.

He was nervous before the interview, so I just
gave him some brahmi leaves to chew on.

<i>But he remembered</i>
<i>the Allegiance Pledge. First time, in English.</i>

That wasn't me. It was the dashmul.
The herb of ten roots.

Lady, you are just playing with me.

Look at these eyes.

You see these dark circles?

<i>Poor Haroun,</i>
<i>who came for the American Dream.</i>

<i>that now works for an Indian nightmare.</i>

Lady...

please.

What's this?

Oh, it's from tire irons and wrenches,
from Arco Garages, my first job.

And erm... before that?

Back in Kashmir we are boatmen.

My grandfather, my father and I,
we would row our shikara for tourists,

from America, Europe.

<i>One year, money was so good,</i>
<i>we lined the seats with red silk.</i>

<i>Chandan, the powder of the sandalwood</i>
<i>tree, that relieves the pain of remembering.</i>

Rub it in.

<i>One day the fighting started.</i>

<i>The soldiers arrived</i>
<i>and the tourists stopped coming.</i>

<i>The rebels came to take the young men.</i>

<i>There was blood.</i>

<i>Blood and more blood...</i>

<i>redder than the red silk of the boat.</i>

<i>I wish I had...</i>

<i>Hurry, now.</i>

<i>Faster, Haroun.</i>

<i>I wish I, too, had...</i>

What was I saying?

You wanted to know your fortune.

Oh, yes.

It is good.
Mm-hm.

Very good.

Great things will happen in this new land for you.

Um...

riches and happiness...

...and maybe even... love.

Oh, Ladyjaan.

Thank you.

I know you have the gift.

Thank you.

I must go.

<i>Poor Haroun.</i>

<i>I, too, was taken from home.</i>

<i>When I was born, my parents' faces</i>
<i>were heavy with fallen hope at another girl.</i>

<i>A daughter meant nothing more</i>
<i>than a dowry debt.</i>

<i>Maybe because I was left</i>
<i>to wander around alone.</i>

<i>I discovered I could see things others could not.</i>

<i>I knew which servant girl</i>
<i>was sleeping with her master.</i>

<i>I told a wealthy landowner</i>
<i>where to find his lost ring.</i>

<i>And I warned the village headman</i>
<i>of the floods before they came.</i>

<i>My fame spread far and wide.</i>

<i>And then the bandits came for me</i>
<i>to lead them to riches.</i>

<i>Mummy! Papa!</i>

Mummy! Papa!

Mummy!

<i>I did not know it,</i>
<i>but I had arrived at my destiny.</i>

<i>First Mother said I had been brought</i>
<i>to her to fulfill my duty as a mistress of spices.</i>

Don't you know it's very important that you know
what the names of these spices are?

Because you will be using them in your work
and you will get the power from them.

<i>Those are red chillies.</i>

<i>Red chillies.</i>

<i>Cardamom.</i>
<i>Cardamom.</i>

<i> Do you listen to the spices?</i>

<i>I was taught the power of the spices</i>
<i>and the consequences for breaking the rules.</i>

First rule...
you are here to see to the other's desires,

never to use the spices for your own.

Cardamom.

Second rule... you may never leave the store.

So there is no danger
of your straying away from the spices.

Is this turmeric?

Give it to me! Give it to me!

Ginger.

Final rule... you may never touch another's skin.

<i>Why are you warning me, chillies?</i>

Sister...

I was wondering if you could help me.

I've seen you here from the salon.

<i>Do you know how to do this?</i>
<i>My girlfriend says it's an Indian thing.</i>

Mehndi.

When are you getting married?

What's that got to do with anything?

Mehndi is normally done on brides.

I was just hoping to wear it to a hair show.

If I have to wait until I get married...
girl, I may never get a chance

<i>Saffron, for lonely nights.</i>

To glow, and attract love into your life.

What is that?

To give you energy for the long hours.

Thank you.
You're welcome, Myisha.

I'll see you real soon, girl. Take care.

See you.

You're cooking for her again?

She loved the coconut korma.

<i>Nothing like its delicate flesh to bind new hearts.</i>

You ready for garlic now?
I don't know about garlic.

You see, me and garlic...
Some religious groups in India never eat it.

That's what I'm talking about. That garlic...

Because they fear its reputation
as an aphrodisiac.

<i>You should try the eggplant bhurtha.</i>

You grill the eggplant over a flame.

Scoop the insides out
and then fry it with ten cloves of garlic,

cumin seeds, little red onions and tomatoes.

And you sprinkle it with coriander leaves.

<i>To feed your passion through the night.</i>

Cool.

Listen, if you get all the ingredients together,
I'll pick it up when I come back from class.

OK, then.

Thanks a lot. See you later.

<i>Jagjit, don't hang on me like a girl.</i>

Go get me daal chini.

Bag!

Oh, Jagjit, the hairs on my head will turn white
before you learn to do anything.

<i>Oh, what's the problem, Osama?</i>

Towel head! Towel head!

<i>Cinnamon, friend maker, warm,</i>
<i>brown as Jaggi's skin.</i>

<i>to find you someone who will show you</i>
<i>this America is not so bad.</i>

Jagjit, do you know what your name means?

World conqueror.

<i>Stupid boy.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Hey, buddy, you OK?</i>
<i>Hey, you got a phone, man?</i>

Hey, man. Are you all right? You OK?
<i>Bring him in.</i>

I can help him.

All right. He's OK. Let's go.

Shall I call an ambulance?

It's nothing.
<i>I know what he needs.</i>

I'll just be a minute.

<i>I have to help him, chillies. He is hurt.</i>

<i>Why did you send him away, spices?</i>
<i>He was no danger to me.</i>

I don't know what happened, but the bike's fine.
I'd better go. Thanks.

But... you are bleeding.

Please.

Sit down.

Hold your arm out, please.

This is very nice of you.

Where did you learn this?

I uh... grew up with it around me.

It must have been passed down
for generations, huh?

<i>Chilies, you can't be his spice.</i>

Nice place you have here.

What's wrong?

You'd better go now.

Well, thank you. It feels much better.

I'd like to give you something for all your...

Thanks again.

You didn't need to do all this.

<i>I should have listened to you, spices,</i>
<i>and sent him away.</i>

<i>I thought he came to me for help.</i>

<i>America, a new land no older than a heartbeat.</i>

<i>There is so little I know about you.</i>

<i>Ladyjaan, I quit my job with Kapadia memsahib.</i>

<i>You quit?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

Last night, I was at Fried Kentucky Chicken
on 14th Street...

and someone grabs my shoulder.

Now, I'm praying to Allah as I turn,
but it's only being Mujibar.

Mujibar from my uncle's village!

I didn't even know he was in America.
And he's done good, too.

He's got a couple of taxis already...

...and he's looking for a driver.

Good pay, he's telling me.
Special for a fellow Kashmiri.

And maybe even the chance to buy later on.

Ladyjaan...

there's nothing like being your own master.

So, from tomorrow, I'm driving a cab,
black and yellow like a sunflower.

<i>A cab?</i>

<i>This is all your doings.</i>

Thank you.

Come and have a look at my taxi.
It's just outside. Come.

Haroun...

you know I cannot leave this store.

The store will be fine without you for a minute.

It's only a bus backfiring. Ladyjaan, come.

Touch it for good luck, huh?

<i>Ladyjaan?</i>

<i>Are you OK?</i>

How many times have I told you?

You should put an ad in India West for a helper.
Running this big store by yourself, it's too much.

Haroun, just be careful.

What?

Look. Please display for me.

My number is on the back,
so you can call me any time.

And I will give you a free ride to San Francisco.

The beautiful Golden Gate Bridge,
Alcatraz Island, the wharf of the fisherman.

I'll take you everywhere.

<i>What does Haroun need?</i>

<i>Kalo jire. Black cumin seeds.</i>

<i>Protector against the evil eye.</i>

<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Hi, Dadaji.

Chi, chi, chi.

I need something for my mental peace.

Ever since I came to this America,
I have not got one iota.

And that Satish of mine,
"Come, Baba, come here," he said.

"We are all here. Why do you want to be far
away from your flesh, blood

and a younger granddaughter?"

I'd rather not have anything
with this granddaughter at all.

Dadaji, Geeta's such a nice girl.

She's pretty, well-spoken,
and she loves my mango pickle.

It's all right with these foreign girls.

But you tell me one thing yourself.

Is it all right to work late, late in the night,
in the office with men?

And that also being dropped by these men
in their cars. You tell me!

Who will want to marry her?

Dadaji... this is America.

And even in India, women are working.

I know it is America. But we are Indians still, no?

You would have not done something like that,
I know it!

When oil and lighting um...

Match.
...match is put together, there's bound to be fire.

And once the fire starts,
it is very difficult to put it out.

I need something for my mental peace.

I'll get you brahmi oil to cool your system.

And one more thing.

Yesterday she was wearing...

Where are you going looking like this?
I'm going out.

With so much of make-up?

In our times, only English women and loose
ladies used to wear so much of make-up.

And good Indian girl is not ashamed
of the face that God has given her.

I'm not ashamed of anything.

And why are you wearing something like this?

You want every man to look at your chest?

Gramps, don't wait up.

But I...

Feeling better?

Thanks to you.

Whatever you put under that bandage
worked wonders.

It's almost all healed.

I didn't get a chance to thank you properly
last time.

I was going to have flowers delivered
and I realized I don't even know your name.

I'm Doug.

Tilo.

I will come back for my peace of mind again.

Chi, Dadaji.

Take care, Dadaji.

You take care, my dear.

It smells so beautiful in here.

I must have passed this store hundreds of times
and I've always been scared to come in.

Scared? Why?

I don't know. I wasn't sure if it was OK
for a guy like me to...

Well, you know.

It seems like it's for your community.

No, it's... it's for everyone.

Wow, there must be thousands of spices in here.

How do you keep track of what they're all for?

I can't even cook an egg.

Everyone has a spice.
Really?

I got a spice too?

Well, which one's mine?

Um... if you'll wait here a minute,
I'll just go find yours.

<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

<i>What does he need?</i>

<i>Is it methi seed for strength?</i>

<i>Ajwain for confidence?</i>

<i>Fennel for perseverance?</i>

<i>Why can't I see?</i>

When you begin to weave your desires
into your vision,

<i>the true seeing is taken from you.</i>

<i>You grow confused</i>
<i>and the spices no longer obey.</i>

<i>Asafoetida, the antidote to love.</i>

<i>You can't be his spice.</i>

These chillies look deadly.

They are. You should stay away from them.

What happened to my spice?

It's not something bad, is it?
Some high-carb spice or something?

It's um... It's a special one.

Sorry.

Hey.

Yeah.

<i>I'll be there, like, in like ten minutes.</i>

<i>OK. Bye.</i>

Sorry about that. It's just we've started
a new building down the street.

There's lots of city politics.

You are an architect?

Yeah, but that's just my job.

I got a spice now.

What's my spice supposed to do for me,
anyway?

It depends. What do you need?

You think I need something?

I'm all out of your spice.

But...

I um...

I have something for you.

What is it?

It's... tulsi.

Holy basil.

Mm. What's it for?

Drink it like tea.

And that's on the house.

You know, it's funny.

People look at me
and think that I'm doing OK.

But you look at me like you know something
you're not telling me.

I only know that everyone's welcome here.

There's no need to be scared.

I still can't believe that you can remember what
all these spices are for without getting mixed up.

It's simple.

We all have spices.

Just like we all have traditions.

Yeah.

Well... I'll drink this tonight.

I'd better get back to work.

Thanks.

<i>Tulsi... for remembering.</i>

Remember to come back.

Don't Shake Me Up

<i>It would be so easy just once</i>
<i>to use the spices for myself.</i>

<i>Crushed prishniparni burned with lotus root in</i>
<i>the evening would make him come back to me.</i>

<i>Tulsi... you were right.</i>

<i>Why should he think of me?</i>

<i>He's remembering someone else.</i>

<i>Hello, Beti. You still here?</i>

You still here? I've got a letter from
Janu Barwa, my old army friend.

They are looking for a match
for his grandnephew.

You gotta be joking!

I mean, why would I leave my career, my family,
all my friends here

to go some place I've visited, like, twice?

I mean,
I don't even like going to the bathroom in India.

Mom... Dad...

I have met someone...

and we're in love.

No shame at all.

Making talk of love.

In front of me, her grandfather.

Anthony Garcia?

Satish, she is marrying a white man?

He's not white. He's chicano.

Chicano? What's that?

I know it's nothing good.

He's Mexican-American.

You are losing your caste and putting
the blackest color on our ancestors' faces

to marry a man whose people
are slum criminals and illegals?

You don't understand, Grandpa.

I understand! I understand everything!

<i>Satish is sitting totally quiet.</i>

I want to tell him.

Once you let cow out of the barn...

...you can't stop it
from trampling the paddy fields.

But when I look at his face...

I don't have the heart.

I say, "Satish...

put me on a plane tomorrow to India.
Tomorrow!"

Dad?

Dad, say something.
I trusted you.

I don't want to see your face.

How can you say that to me?

<i>Fine.</i>

Then I'm gonna move in with Tony!

Because he's been asking me.

All this time I've been saying no
because I've been thinking of you.

But now I will.

Then I'll just go ahead and marry him.

Because that's what <i>we</i> want.

I do not know what to do.

So I came to you.

I know you can help.

Please.

<i>Almond powder and kesar to boil in milk.</i>

<i>The whole family must drink it.</i>

<i>To sweeten your words</i>
<i>and remember the love buried under the anger.</i>

Thank you.

It's so late.

I'll take a taxi home instead of bus.

<i>Haroun.</i>

<i>Please forgive me, spices.</i>

I've been distracted.

How could I forget the kalo jire
to shield Haroun from the evil eye?

Hey.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to...
It's nothing.

Here, let me take a look.

Here. Put some water on it.

Clean it out.

Is that better?

Ladyjaan?

What's going on?

Haroun...
You should um...

You should put something on that cut.

Yes, I'll get a neem leaf.

Please help him. It's OK, I'm in no hurry.

You should be careful
who you let in your store after dark.

There's all kinds of mad people roaming
around this neighborhood.

How come your door wasn't locked today?

Just last week a man broke
into the Sri Lankan 7-Eleven

and shot the owner in the chest three times.

Better you ask this fellow to leave
while I'm still being here.

Haroun, I can look after myself very well.

And it's best you do not insult my customers.

I was...

I was speaking out of concern like a brother.

I see I stepped too far.

I didn't mean it like that.

What right have I, a poor... taxi driver...
to advise you... a lady?

Haroun, please don't go.

I'll have your package in a few minutes.

Haroun, please!

I'm sorry about...
It's OK.

He uh... He seemed kind of pissed off, though.

Is he? Are you and he?

No, no, no, he's just a loyal customer.

He needed some kalo jire for protection.

How can you be so sure what he needs?

I just know.

Like you know what I need?

Why did you give me that tea to drink?

For clarity... at work.

Well, ever since you gave it to me,
I've been having the most incredible dreams...

...remembering all this stuff
that I'd completely forgotten about.

I don't know how you do it, but you're incredible.

<i>I'm sorry, spices.</i>

Are you OK?

<i>I must give him the asafoetida</i>
<i>and send him away for ever.</i>

Um... I'm sorry...

It's... It's very late.

I hope I haven't offended you.

Just I... I just... I just wanted to thank you.

Maybe I can buy you some dinner sometime
and we can go somewhere nice.

I can't leave the store.
I mean when you're not busy with the store.

You must get a day off sometime.

I could pick you up on my bike and...

What's your favorite food?

Sushi, Italian.
I know a great little place in Chinatown.

It has the most...
I can't leave the store.

Are you married? Have you got a boyfriend?

No! No.

I guess your family wouldn't approve, huh?

Are they real traditional?

I've broken too many rules already.

I think you should leave.

<i>I'm sorry, I never gave you your true spice.</i>

<i>Please... do not leave me... spices.</i>

<i>You must speak to me again.</i>

<i>My spices, I knew you wouldn't abandon me.</i>

Garlic never fails.

<i>It is known as the wonder food back home.</i>

You know, I have the perfect thing for you today.

Paan... a must at the end of every couple's meal.

What it has here is slivers of supari
for intoxication...

...shredded coconut for sweet words...

fennel seeds to digest them...

...and... cardamom...
to make the words last forever.

We broke up.

She said it was all going too fast.

I guess I overwhelmed her.

I'm sorry.

I thought I was onto something good.

<i>Spices, why punish him when I broke the rules?</i>

I came by to ask if I could put this up
in your window.

Yeah, sure.

I'm teaching a new karate class.

<i>Jagjit?</i>

<i>Yes, it's Jagjit.</i>

I remember that look.

Thanks, huh?

Hello, Jagjit.

It's Jag.

Everything better in school now?
Who told <i>you</i>?

Well, the boys, they don't trouble you any more?

I've got friends now.

<i>Oh, cinnamon, friend maker,</i>
<i>what have you done? What friends are these?</i>

<i>Cinnamon, we are losing him.</i>

<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

<i>Is this the way you've chosen to punish me?</i>

<i>And what about</i> him?

<i>How will you punish him?</i>

<i>Don't spices.</i>

<i>He didn't mean to touch me.</i>

<i>I won't see him again, spices.</i>

<i>Please, don't hurt him.</i>

Hi.

<i>Such perfect timing, my clever spices.</i>

I wanna make a special meal for someone,
but I've never cooked Indian before.

<i>She looks like she's never chopped an onion</i>
<i>in her life.</i>

I was hoping you could help me with that.

Yes, of course.

My problem is, I don't know what I want.

Who are you cooking for?

Well, it's for this guy I've been dating.

But he's been kinda distant lately.

I wanna make something easy.

But I don't want the smell to get into my hair
and stay in the house.

You know what I mean?

Um... I'll find the perfect thing for you.

Great.

<i>I could give her mischievous mustard seed</i>
<i>to send him away from her forever.</i>

<i>I really appreciate this.</i>

<i>He's gonna love it.</i>

Maybe you can make him
a sumptuous biryani with green cardamom.

<i>You are speaking to me again.</i>

OK.

<i>Cardamom, to bind true loves.</i>

<i>Then it must be her that he needs.</i>

<i>Who am I to take away their happiness?</i>

Here's your change.
Thanks so much.

I'll have him eating out of my hand after this.

I'll let you know how it turned out.

You must. Good luck.

<i>I must let him go.</i>

<i>Or the spices will destroy us both.</i>

<i>I've neglected what is important.</i>

<i>Anant Soni, who comes every month for rendi,</i>
<i>oil from the castorplant.</i>

<i>to massage into his mother's arthritic hands.</i>

<i>And Prameela Viji</i>
<i>who sells million-dollar houses.</i>

<i>and sends the money to her sister in a shelter.</i>

<i>I'll give her a special blend</i>
<i>of my garam masala today, for hope.</i>

<i>Thank you, spices,</i>
<i>for reminding me of my duty to others.</i>

Tilo...

Tilo, I need to speak to you.

Doug, I cannot...
Just for, like, two minutes.

Please.

I'll get you a nimbu pani. A lime soda.

It'll cool you down.

So uh... what's wrong?

It's my mom.

She died.

I'm so sorry.

Was she with you?

No.

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... bust in here like this.

I just... I think I'm in shock, you know.

I should go.

No, wait.
<i>- No, you were right.</i>

<i>- I shouldn't have come.</i>
Have this drink.

Please.

<i>Black gold.</i>

<i>Brought by traders round the world.</i>

<i>King of spices.</i>

Is that pepper? That was strong.

<i>To help you tell your deepest secrets.</i>

You can tell me whatever you want.

I won't judge you.

I never really talked about this with anybody.

I don't even know where to start.

I feel so numb.

It's my mom.

Her ashes just showed up at my doorstep.

I don't even know how they found me.

I never wanted to see her again till I met you.

<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>my mom died for me a long time ago.</i>

<i>My dad was an orphan</i>
<i>who met my mom at a roadside diner.</i>

<i>His hands were always so black</i>
<i>from working at the refinery.</i>

But my mom's hands...

<i>... were always perfect.</i>

Vroom! Vrooom!

She looked like a movie star.

You know, she had these high pointy heels.

<i>Even her name - Celestina -</i>

<i>had more flair than the neighbors".</i>

<i>She used to complain about my hair.</i>

She said it was too coarse, unruly.

One day this man showed up at our house
when my dad was at work.

Evie. Evie!

Why have you come here? To ruin my life?

<i>You ought to be ashamed,</i>
<i>acting like a white woman.</i>

Your little boy don't even know who he is.

Dougie, honey, go back upstairs.

Get out of here.

He's dying.
I promised him I'd find you and tell you.

I don't know owe him nothing.

The next day, when my dad was gone,

my mom took us on a ride.

Evie.

<i>Evie, my little flower.</i>

You came... with your son.

Please.

<i>Leave the boy with me.</i>

I only have a little time,
my darling granddaughter.

<i>Please... let me talk to him.</i>

I ask it as payment for all that you threw away.

I want the boy to have a choice for his life's path.

<i>As you had.</i>

Please...

<i>let me talk to him.</i>

<i>Please.</i>

You can talk to him, Tata.

But I stay in the room.

For you, my son.

No!

Tata.

Come on.

We've gotta get out of here.

Come on!
No!

You killed him!
I should never have come back here!

Phew!
This pepper drink has a kick to it, I tell you.

I don't even know
why I dumped all that stuff on you.

I'm sorry.

Come.

Let's get some fresh air.

It's embarrassing to bring all this stuff up.

Did you ever go back?

After my dad died, I left home
and stopped talking to my mom.

God, I hated her.

She gave it all up cos she wanted to fit in.

And you just abandoned her?

I'm not proud of that.

I did try to find her a few years ago.

But she moved away.

You know, the old man...

Your great-grandfather.

Although he spoke to me in some language
I never heard before, I still understood him.

You know what? I felt part of something.

I kept that feather all these years,

hoping one day I'd find
what he was trying to give me.

<i>Now it's too late.</i>

Is it?

I'm betting you know exactly what to do.

No, I don't always have all the answers, Doug.

From my window in San Francisco,
sometimes I look across the bay and...

...I imagine you here.

I've never really been to San Francisco.

You're kidding me.

Well, come with me, then.
I'll show you everything, all my spots.

I cannot.

There's more to you than this store, Tilo.
I know that.

And I know that... a handsome man like you
can never be alone.

You'd be surprised.

I didn't have a clue what I wanted till I met you.

Not a clue.

Did you ever feel like you just want to...

...you just want to start all over again?

I guess it's easy for me to say
because I don't have what you have.

I'm not rooted like you are.

When the roots are too strong,
they can strangle you too.

I'll see you tomorrow, then?

It's a date?

Come on.

You deserve a day off.

<i>Haroun.</i>

<i>I'll stay up all night</i>
<i>and split the seeds for Haroun.</i>

<i>I must protect him.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Are you trying to kill us?

My husband nearly choked.

It's much too hot. It burnt his insides.

I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

I put the same amount of chillies in it.

You've been careless, that's what's happened.

Now, who's going to pay doctor's bills, huh?

I'm really sorry. Please, take back your money.

How's Jagjit?
My son is none of your business.

You've done enough damage.

I am having no luck.
Satish refuses to mention Geeta.

The almond and kesar powder?

We did everything that you asked us to do.

<i>Can't you see, spices?</i>
<i>All Geeta wants is to be happy.</i>

<i>Don't turn on me, spices.</i>

<i>You know my customers need me.</i>

<i>Don't punish them.</i>

<i>Dadaji, you said you would do anything</i>
<i>to bring Geeta back into the family.</i>

<i>Mix this in your rice and for one hour</i>
<i>you will have the golden tongue.</i>

<i>Whatever you ask, people must obey.</i>

OK.

<i>Spices, I have to get the kalo jire to Haroun.</i>

<i>This is for him...</i>

<i>not for me.</i>

<i>I'm not leaving you, spices.</i>

<i>I will be back.</i>

Sure you wanna do this?

I'm going because I have to help someone.

This is where I have to go.

OK.

Don't worry.

Here's your helmet.

Haroun!

He just left five minutes ago.

But he comes back at sundown for prayers
and food and then he goes back out again.

We must be back before sundown.

I'll bring you back. Don't worry.

Just shift gears.

Today... I get to take care of you.

Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha "Flute Mix"

Thank you.

Sure you don't want me to stay for you?
I can wait here.

No, it's OK. My friend will take me home.

OK.

Thank you.

Hey!

Thanks.

I had a great day.

Haroun?

He hasn't returned yet.

Why don't you come in and have some hot chai?

He'll soon be home for prayers.

No, thank you.

Chai?

Thank you.

I'm Hameeda.
I'm Tilo.

Do you live alone?

No, no, my brother brought me here to study.

He and his wife look after me.

Do you know Haroun well?

Oh, no, he's always so busy.

And he's so shy with women
he hardly speaks to me.

If we meet on the stairs, he just says
"Salaam alaikum," and hurries down.

He won't even look me in the eyes.

That's his car. He's home.

He goes to the market and always gets so much
fresh fruit, he comes up with so many bags.

Haroun?

Haroun!

Help me!

No time for tears, Ladyjaan.
Hold his head like this and Bhaijaan go get help.

Ambulance?
No, no, who knows who they'll tell?

We'll get Rahman sahib instead.

Haroun.

<i>I'm so sorry I failed you.</i>

<i>Distracted by my own desires.</i>

So many wounds like this I've had to stitch.

Nobody puts this in letters
when sending money home.

Tilo, daughter, you have gone too far.

This will destroy you and everything you are.

First Mother.

You must return now to where you belong.

You are in danger.

You have broken too many rules.

But we have to live by different rules here.

Maybe the spices are not enough
by themselves.

You are nothing without the spices.

The spices are your tradition.

Do not let America seduce you.

With your dreams of love,
you have roused the spices' hate.

You know about him?

To all whom a mistress loves,
as she should not...

chaos will come.

<i>I want the spices.</i>

<i>And him.</i>

If a mistress fails in her duty, fire is the end.

<i>The spices will decide.</i>

I'm not waiting as long for you
to take another day off, you know.

It's not going to work.

What do you mean?

There are rules.

So?

Your mother broke the rules
and look how that hurt you.

That was her choice.

But you helped me make sense of it.

You said I can be whoever the hell I want to be.

So can you.

Don't kill this.

Don't kill this before it's even started.

I'm coming back for you tonight.

<i>Spices, I know it cannot be.</i>

<i>I have chosen to go back.</i>

Hello, Beti.

It's still hurting.

But I had to come and thank you.

Geeta's coming home with her boyfriend,
that Tony fellow.

<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

<i>You have helped open eyes,</i>
<i>so Geeta can marry her love.</i>

I'm not going to say anything.

Hello!

I saw the poster in your window
and went along to his class.

<i>And saffron,</i>
<i>Myisha and Kwesi have found love, too.</i>

He can cook, too.

She taught me everything I know.

<i>What do we get?</i>
<i>Anything with garlic.</i>

Everything OK, Jagjit?

Yeah, it's all good.

Don't be scared. It's just a bus backfiring.

Scared? I ain't scared.

Are you all right, son? Somebody after you?

How would you like never to be scared again,
Jagjit?

Teach him, till he's a master like you.

Why are you doing this?

Because I want to.

<i>Cinnamon,</i>
<i>you have found a true friend for Jagjit</i>

<i>to guide him through the highs and lows</i>
<i>of life in America.</i>

<i>Thank you, spices.</i>
<i>Their desires are now fulfilled.</i>

Whatever, man...

I never got to cook for him.

Turns out he's fallen in love with someone else.

He told you that?

Yeah.

I can't hate him for it.
I've never seen him so happy.

<i>Please, spices, give me one night with Doug.</i>

<i>One night for</i> my <i>desires.</i>

<i>Then you have me forever.</i>

Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha

Ladyjaan.

You look... different.

Or is it my eye playing?

I have brought something for you.

Are you feeling better?

Oh, yes.
Hameeda and her brother have been very kind.

She's been cooking all day for us
and she's been keeping me company.

Today will you have some chai?

And you?

Sure. I'll help her.

Haroun... I've come to say goodbye.

Where are you going?

I'm returning back home.

What about your store, Ladyjaan,
and your customers?

Is it not right for us to go back
to where we belong?

Not for me, Ladyjaan.

Are you not angry at what they did to you?

Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan.

But I still have both my eyes
and I have such friends.

<i>Haroun, you have found so much more</i>
<i>than wealth here.</i>

<i>You came for a dream and found love.</i>

Now, what did you bring for me?

It's for Hameeda.

Well, actually... it's for you both... together.

<i>Lotus root.</i>

You put this on her on the night of your wedding.

It's for a lifetime of deep loving.

Here it is.

What do you think?

It's uh... It's beautiful.

Is this yours?

Oh, yeah. It's an old bakery, actually.

I just love the idea of making old things new.

There's something cool about it.

<i>Forgive me, Doug,</i>
<i>but I have to return to where I belong.</i>

<i>You showed me such love.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>But it cannot be.</i>

<i>I do not expect you to understand.</i>

<i>But there is no other way.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>I will carry your love with me forever.</i>

<i>Spices.</i>

<i>I never left you.</i>

<i>I could have lived with you.</i>

<i>And him.</i>

<i>Love cannot be wrong.</i>

<i>But I will leave him, if it means losing you.</i>

<i>I give my life to you.</i>

Tilo!

Tilo!

Are you OK?

Are you OK?

I woke up and you were gone.

I read your note.

I crossed the bridge and just
as I got to the other side...

...the quake hit.

Are you sure you're OK?

Yes.

Let's get you out... Let's get you out of here.

Tilo Mistress,
you have shown your devotion to the spices.

The spices know you will never leave them.

Doug, I'm not leaving.

You're staying with me.

I mean here.

I'm not leaving here.

Tilo, there's nothing left here.

This is my home.

I guess I can help you rebuild it.

You never told me what my spice is.

Sesame.

Tilo.
