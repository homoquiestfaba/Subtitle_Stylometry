Oh!

Alack, doth hath

While you were out
warring, Halsey--

My brother.

We're betrothed.

And this is his
idea of courtship?

Zounds!

Thou art but bait!

We must away!

[SHACKLES CLINKING]

We must away!

We must away.

Away!

I am not going
out that way.

[LOUD MENACING LAUGH]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

Unhand her, you

Aye, Beelzebub.

Tell me, he doesn't
still have you doing
his dirty work?

You know this

Mm, our nursemaid. Always

Little toady.

I'll give you toady.

GWEN: Goodnight,
Mrs. Polanski.

Zoe, I know you can hear me.

Give me my kissy or else.

Or else!

Do you give, do you
give, do you give?

Never!

Okay, okay, okay.

Give me, give me, give me.

Geez, nothing comes between
you and your frog man.

Prince, Mom.

Frog Prince.

Well, it wouldn't
hurt you to spend
a little less time

with make believe
and a little more
time with Math.

Come on.

Sure, as soon as you
do a little less work

and have a little
more fun.

I have all the fun I
need to have with you.

Now sleep.

Mommy, I miss Daddy, too,

but he'd want
you to live
happily ever after.

You are my happily
ever after, Zoe.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

Goodnight, Daddy.

[CAR HONKS]

You handsome rascal, you.

When I think of all the
hearts sure to break

when they hear their
favorite marquess, me,

Percival of Summerland
is off the market.

Talking to
ourselves again, sir?

At least I don't
give me a hard time

over everything, Wilkins.

At least I...
know my place.

Oh, if you're referring
to my reminding you

that a marriage
without love is...

Is so old-fashioned.

Love never goes
out of fashion, sir.

Well, tell that to
the royal pains in my--

That would be
rude and impudent

to offer the Duke
and the Duchess...

You had no problem
pointing out my--

Oh what, my pointing out
your foolishness, Percival?

No, none indeed.

Thank you, Wilkins.

And thus concludes
today's lecture.

Final lecture, sir.

For if you insist
on throwing away
your future...

I'm not throwing
away my future.

I'm surrendering to it.

Oh, you mean
resigning, sir?

I have one job.

One responsibility to
my family and my title.

I marry someone.

The right someone.

And besides, I'm not about
to throw away my life

on some antiquated
notion of true love.

I'm sorry, Wilkins,
but I like my life.

I like doing whatever
strikes my fancy.

It's...fun.

Fun to toy with
the innocent heart
of another?

Oh please, it's an
arranged marriage.

Hilary doesn't love me.

She barely knows me.

Oh, would you please
help me with this?

Sir, just so we're clear.

Your persisting
in this charade

places me in an
untenable position.

Meaning what?

You'd resign?

You know, somewhere
deep inside you

is a prince of a man
dying to get out.

I just pray that
you'll find him
before it's too late.

Good job, Wilkins.

Naturally, sir.

We specified only organic

Is this buckshot?

HILARY: Can you see it, Percy?

My poise?

I've been refining it.

Mother says I owe
it to her subjects

to always look majestic.

After all, we are
going to be majesties.

I think that your wedding
is highly overrated.

Exactly, such
a plebeian month.

And besides, we
spend all our Junes

summering in the
south of France.

Of course.
We spend ours

in our award-winning
vineyards in Napa.

How's your July?

A maritime modeling festival.

Top judge this year.

August?

International
Bridge Championship.

Oh! Here I took
you for a yahtzee man.

And for our honeymoon, I
was thinking of taking in

one of our
commonwealth countries.

You know, a cute sounding
one like Papua New Guinea.

I just love
the Caribbean.

South Pacific, Hilary.

Papua New Guinea's
in the South Pacific.

Oh, better start brushing
up on my geography then.

After all, we are
going to carry on

your family's
grand tradition

and send our children
abroad for school.

Think how much fun it
will be to visit them.

It will be like
taking a vacation.


Well, September
it is then.

That'll give us
plenty of time
to manipulate the media.

Re, our family alliance.

PERCY'S MUM: Yet, one must
remember one's station.

Now this tea is for
the common people,

and we are never common.

HILARY: But, if
our sweet babies

spend too much
time in Australia,

they might develop
an Australian accent,

which I find a little tinny
on the ear, don't you?

I mean, it is rather
common, right?

An Australian accent
compared to yours?

It's considered common.

Because the last
thing we want to do

is raise common children.

I wonder what New
Zealand sounds like?

PERCY: Just stepping
out for a bit of fresh air.

[CABLE CAR BELL RINGS]

[SLOW HEART BEATS]

[HEART BEATING FASTER]

Steady, sir.

You've done enough.

[CAR HORN HONKS]

[GENTLE BLUES MUSIC PLAYING]

All right?

Yo, prom queen.

Take a hike, okay?

If you hurry,
you might get
to the ball in time

Where am I?

And what is all this?

Yeah, webbed toes?

Eww, it must be some kind
of residual side effect.

What effect?

From when you
were a frog.

Well, when you were
turned into a frog.

Not by me. I turned
you into a man.

Well, back into a man.

Not on purpose.

Not that I'm sorry I did.

Seeing you're a Prince with
that royal sash you have.

Anyway, it was just
an accident.

I pinched your
poor little foot.

The frog's foot.

The frog that I
kissed at the pond.

Just before it, he,
you, turned into a man.

Prince.

Look, just scrub up
and I'll leave you

some clean clothes
outside the door.

And then I'll show
you what I mean.

And hurry, we
don't have all day.


What?

Green, green, ye shall
be for all eternity.

Until the purest
maiden fair lays
a smooch on thee.

I know it's a lot to
take in all at once,

but when you add up
your webbed toes,

the sash, my kiss,

all the evidence is here
that you are, in fact,

the actual Frog Prince.


none of this makes
even a bit of sense.

Hey, you're the one
who doesn't remember

who you are
or how you got here.

At least I have a logical
explanation to offer you.

Let me see that.

Having vanquished
the enemies of the King,

the brash and brave young
knight, Flynn of Stewart,

returned home.

Lady fair, treachery,
betrothed, zounds.

Who on earth
says zounds?

It's not normal!

Coming out of your mouth?

With that fancy
English accent of yours,

you are
incontrovertible proof

you are indeed a Prince.

Don't look at me
like that.

Try again, you'll see.

Zounds.

No, like you mean it.

Zounds.

Zounds.

Zounds!

[BOTH LAUGH]

This is nothing
but poppycock.

No man, and certainly
no brave knight

would ever say zounds.

The you in the book does.

[FLYNN LAUGHS]
[DOOR SLAMS]

That's got to be
Mrs. Polanski.

MRS. POLANSKI: What
have you done to my floor?

Go on, get in.
She won't understand.

Jail, or worse if she
finds out you're here.

For both of us!

But I--

No but's, Flynn.

Here, read
all about you.

Leaving early?

Walking home alone?

I searched that
entire school for you.

Almost had
a heart attack!

I can't take this anymore!

Bye.

A miscommunication.

You really want to
stick with that?

Zoe, do you have any idea
what it does to my day

to have another nanny quit
over something you've done?

Especially one who
liked my list as much
as Mrs. Polanski.

I don't want a nanny.

I want you.

Oh, sweetie, you have me.

But you know I can't
leave you home alone

while I go to work.

I have to support
this family,

and this does not help!

GWEN: And what
happened in here?

I overfilled the tub.

No kidding.
What is that smell?

It's like pond scum.

We dissected
frogs in Science.

I must have got
frog guts on me.

Well, wash them off
and clean this up.

I have to go back
to the restaurant,

because I have
to do the books,

and you know
what that means.

Mom.

I'm calling Mrs. Bieker!

<i>TV ANCHOR: The odds of

Prince Flynn of Stewart.

Dashing older brother
to the loathsome
Halsey of Stewart.

So, tell me something
that I don't know.

Halsey's a snake.
I've been there,
read that.

But right now we've got
to get you to some place

Mom hardly ever goes.

Snake is too kind.

Halsey stole my lady
intent on marrying her

upon the lie that
I was unworthy.

Well, you were
always unworthy.

In chapter two,
that joust you lost?

Chapter five.

Deserting your post?

Chapter nine.

Almost drowning
in the moat?

Well, I was never
much of a swimmer.

You spent six
months as a frog!

The water was freezing!

Here, look.

It's all right here.

[MAGICAL FANTASY

Well?

Egads, you're right.

Chapter after chapter
nothing but a disappointment.

All looks and no game.

No wonder my lady
found me lacking.

GWEN: Mrs. Bieker?

Mrs. Bieker, wake up.

Don't just sit there.

Mom's back from
her restaurant.

Come on, come on!
In here!

Here, take this.

You should have seen it.

I've just never seen a
tournament like that.

It was a hole in one,

and then another one.

Sounds amazing.

And it just kept
going on and on.

Unbelievable!

Thank you, goodnight.

Goodnight.

Zoe, I'm sorry for
losing my temper.

But I just can't help
worrying about you,

and when we have
a day like today
I go a little crazy.

Sweetie, come on,
talk to me.

What in the world
came over you?

You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

Of course I would.

What I said about
dissected frogs?

I couldn't do it, so I
ditched to set him free.

But I hurt him
and then kissed him

and turned him
into a Prince.

Which makes sense,
as there's a blue moon
this month.

Meaning tons of
more love and magic.

Sweetie, you know
that a blue moon

is nothing more
than a lunar event.

There is no magic.

I mean, why can't you be
like other girls your age

and just be obsessed with
werewolves and vampires?

Is that what
this is about?

I have some amazing
mystery Prince
as a Valentine?

Baby, you're my
favorite Valentine.

I'm not a baby.

Maybe somebody else
wants to be my
Valentine this year.

Somebody, not you.

Oh, so that's how it is.

You've got
a better offer.

No.

Maybe.

It's more than that.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

GWEN: Daddy's Valentine?

I never told you,
but that last year,

when he gave me this,

Daddy said he wanted
me, you and me,

to someday have
another someone special

to give us Valentines.

I was just hoping
you knew that this
would be the year.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

[INSECTS CHIRPING]

Ghastly is what it is.

To come gallivanting
who knows where with
who knows who

when he knew we had plans
to be in D'gustar this week.

It's reprehensible.

And to have to bring
in the local authorities.

Wilkins, how is it
you so easily

tracked Percy
to that circus
he joined in Milan,

yet cannot find him here?

Shocking, my Lord.

Undone by the mad carnival
that is San Francisco.

[SHIP HORN BLOWS]

GWEN: I've brought extra
coffee for the Frog Prince.

Where is he?

[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

Psst! Wake up!

Hey!


Do not under
any circumstances
go anywhere.

I have to figure out
where you're gonna live

now that you're
a man again.

So...stay.


[CHUCKLES AND SNORTS]

Replace Mrs. Polanski.

Ruthie?

You can't be serious.

Come on,
it helps me think.

Fine, check.

I could read some
of Zoe's books.

RUTHIE: Check.

I could--

Stop making lists

to avoid dealing with
what really matters.
Check!

Like you know everything.

I know that Zoe's
infatuation with
this Frog Prince

is just her way of
filling an emotional void.

Thank you, Dr. Phil.

Look, mock all you want,

but you're living your
life as if it's on hold

and smothering Zoe
in the process.

Which doesn't lead
to open communication

like knowing she has
a crush on some boy.

Okay, I will admit it.

I don't know what to do.

You know what to do.

You just don't
want to do it.

And you know that
what Zoe really wants

is what you really need.

An M-A-N, man.

I don't need a man,
and what I really want
is a happy daughter.

Prove it.

Go on a date,
have some fun,
take a chance on love!

Love takes too much time,

and I don't already have
enough time as it is.

No one has
enough time, Gwen.

Why do you think I like
having Stanley around?

He may not be a prince,
but he's a heck of a cop

and a great husband.

I know I'm just your
older, must wiser sister,

so why should you
listen to me?

But Zoe would benefit
from a male influence,

and it wouldn't be so
bad for you, either.

It's just ridiculous.

What's ridiculous?

How late it is.

Yes, it is getting late.

And Jason's alone
with Stanley. Bye.

Bye.

You eat, then dress.

With no one here
to watch you,

you're gonna need
to come to work
with me today,

so bring some homework.

I promised Mrs. B
I'd stick around.

You want to spend
your whole Saturday
with Mrs. Bieker? You?

I promised her I'd
help her do her laundry,

and besides, I'm saving
for a new outfit,

and she's gonna
give me five bucks.

MRS. BIEKER: This
is so surprising.

I had no idea you were
a budding laundress.

Yeah, it's a new
passion of mine.

Well, I really
appreciate the help.

But Mr. B. used
to help, too.

Oh yes, my Harold
found household chores
quite relaxing.

It must be nice being
surrounded by his stuff.

Like maybe some
of his old clothes

are around here somewhere?

You know,
to remind you of him.

Oh yes, I never could
part with any of it.

I'll just put
these away for you.

[DOOR SQUEAKS]

<i>GWEN: I don't care what
Ruthie says, Stanley.</i>

<i> I'm not in a rut.</i>

Come on.

If this isn't a rut,
I don't know what is.

I grew up here with Matt.

Since his folks
opened the restaurant.

We played together.

We got in trouble together.

Met a pair of beautiful
sisters and married them.

But you haven't changed a
thing around here in years.

Look, Gwen.

Even a guy like me,

he can only eat
so much of your
magnificent meatloaf

before he wants
a cheeseburger.

Now if Matt were here, I
think he'd tell you the same.

Maybe it's time
for you to just

shake things up
a little bit.

That's all I'm saying.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

I-I meant no harm.

Wow, look how little I am.

ZOE: Look at Mom.

Look at Daddy.

They were so great together.

You have his eyes,
you know.

Your father's.

Sir Matthew of Cole.

Just Matthew. Cole's
our last name.

Not our kingdom.

If it's not too
forward of me--

Daddy died
when I was seven.

He had cancer,

but we had lots and lots
of time to say goodbye.

This is in the park,
not too far from
where I found you.

That was our spot.

Mom would fix these
great picnics down there,

so we'd just go
be there together.

Daddy would make up
the corniest stories

on how the squirrels were
plotting against the ducks.

Silly stuff.

Mom doesn't like
going anymore.

She usually comes home
early on Saturdays.

We'd better hurry
if we're gonna keep
you off the streets.

Why would I be
on the streets?

'Cause if I can't
convince my mom

to hire you
as my male nanny,

that's where
you'll be living.

[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

No.

No.


[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

Yes.

Okay, now for this to work,
you need a total makeover.

Just relax.

GWEN: Hey, good afternoon.
What can I get you?

A cup of tea
with milk please.

Hot.

Pardon?

Your milk?

Would you like it hot?

I mean warmed?

No, that wouldn't
be necessary.

Anything else?
Something to eat?

Prince Charles
told me that

if I was ever
in San Francisco,

that I must sample
the hot apple pie
at Cole's Coffee Shop.

Right, and I'm
the Queen Mother.

See how handsome I am?

Please tell me
you didn't open it.

This is a limited edition
collectible Blue Moon doll.

Oh, thank goodness.

You didn't open the
others, did you?

The Lady or the Halsey?

These are not for play.

You never open these toys.

Understand?

Uh huh, yes.

We don't have all day
and I have to get
this finished.

[MAGICAL FANTASY MUSIC PLAYING]

Okay, wait here
for 10 minutes, tops.

And don't forget
the handshake.

Mom's big on those.

Hey, Zooey!

We've been out
shopping all day
for Valentine's Day.

I bought the cutest
outfit to wear for Sam.

Oh, look, girls.

Cirque du Soleil
must be in town.

Mistress Zoe,

are these children
known to you?

I'm Kate Basset.

And you are?

I? Why, I am...

Oh, my! What's this?

What? Are you some
kind of fortune teller
or something?

Is he, Zoe?

Only the world's best.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

Well, what do you see?

Tell me!

Well, sadly, that you are

a...spoiled imp!

And unless you repent
and mend your cruel ways,

you'll live a life
in a solitary state.

And from here on, you'll
wear only common clothing.

Oh, and Duckie,
your little chums,

they mock you
behind your back.

[DRAMATIC TONES]

GIRL: Kate, wait!

Too hard, too soft?

Just right.

See you in 10.

[CHANGE RATTLES]

Okay, thank you,
Mrs. Bieker.

Whoa!

[TENSE MUSIC PLAYING]

[LOUD THUMP AND THUD]

[THIEF GRUNTS]

[FLYNN GRUNTS]

[SHUFFLING AND MEN GRUNTING]

Get off him!

Get away from him!

I'll beat you like
a rented mule!

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

[BOY YELLS]

Jason, get back here!

Oh, dear.

So, where is this
royal nanny?

Late, and I really don't
need your help, Ruthie.

Yes, you do, and
Stanley insisted.

[LOUD PING AND GLASS SHATTERS]

Oh, no jumping!

Jason, get down from
there this instant!

Okay.

Oh, this flake is
definitely a no-show.

You can go home
now, Ruthie,

and take
Jackson Pollock, Jr.
with you.

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

I'll get it.

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

I'd hang onto that
if I were you.

Please, forgive
my tardiness.

What happened to you?

I ran into bit
of a hiccup, sorry.

This is no time
for sorry.

Head up, chest out.

Let's see some charm.

Licensed by the BMA.

Bonded by
Lloyd's of London.

An RAF veteran.

What can anybody
say but "wow"?

RUTHIE: Jason
stop finger painting

with your mashed
potatoes and eat!

But it's all gooey and
everything's touching.

<i> It's touching.
It's touching.</i>

<i>HILARY: It's
considered common,
considered common,</i>

<i> it's considered common.</i>

My nephew, he's
got some sort of

finicky food
mushing disorder.

By your leave,
my ladies.

Madam...if I may?

Knock yourself out.

Young sir, in my youth,

I, too, found that
when foods collided,

the meal was not
to my liking.

Really?

Very.

However, when one
took the time

to divide up the meats,

greens, and starches,

and gave them ample space to
live in harmony on the plate,

my compulsion to mush my
food was suddenly gone.

And the meal
not only appealing,
but rather yummy.

What say you
give it a go?

[FLYNN LAUGHS]

[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

I call dibs if you
don't want him.

What do you mean call?

You saw him with Jason.

This guy
is a miracle worker.

A looker, too.

Mr. Stewart.

Flynn, my lady.

Simply Flynn.

Okay, Flynn.
You've got the job.

How soon can you start?

There's no time
like the present.

Great, where
are you staying?

Why?

Because you'll want
to get your belongings

so you can move in.

Mom, I think he
means the W.

My belongings
are on my back.

I left my things
some place

and have no clue as
to their whereabouts.

Isn't it just like
the airlines to lose
all his luggage?

Since no one
seems to need me,

guess we'll be going.

Pardon me, my lady.

A thousand times
goodnight.

You, too.

I'll be seeing you--

All right.

Real soon.

Goodnight, Ruthie.

Goodnight, okay.
Bye-bye.

Okay, so you will escort
Zoe to and from school,

supervise homework,
shop, do light housework,

and see that she has
three squares a day.

I find that detailing
assignments in writing

really helps
with communication.

Any questions?

Only one.

Where does one
acquire these squares
for Miss Zoe?


What a kidder.


Would you look
at the time?

Shouldn't we show
Flynn his bedroom?

Let him get some rest?

[PHONE RINGS AND BEEPS]

Yeah?

<i>EFFIE: Your call from
Scotland Yard is on line two.</i>

Thanks, Effie.
[PHONE BEEPS]

<i>O'MALLEY: Inspector
O'Malley here.</i>

Inspector!

Good to finally speak.

Yeah, listen.

I was wondering if
you had anything

on a gentleman who goes by
the name of Flynn Stewart?

Everyone has a bad day
once in awhile, Flynn,

but you yesterday...

Yes, my lady, a
brilliant disaster.

Let's review, shall we?

Bacon will catch fire
if left unattended.

FLYNN: Check.

Dish towel?

Not a fire extinguisher.

Check.

Colors run in hot water.

FLYNN: Check.

And should any of these
bad days happen again...

My services will
no longer be required,
my lady?

Check.

And so you don't
get lost, Zoe's school
is right here.

Mom, I'm gonna be
there to show him.

Not when he comes
to pick you up.

And button, Flynn,
to the top, okay?

From now on,
whatever happens,

keep your mouth shut
and smile.

Oh, my keys.

Good thing Flynn
reminded me.

[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

So, use these
at Walgreens,

these at Safeway,

and these to get
my dry cleaning.

And I want receipts.

Now, let's talk
about groceries.

[ELEVATOR DINGS]

Who doesn't know how to
get to Fisherman's Wharf?

He's new in town.

Really new.

You take a cable car
downhill till you
hit the bay.

How hard is that?

It's you!

Flynn, right?

It's me, remember?

Mr. Wong gave me 100
bucks to split with you,

but by the time the cops
left, you disappeared.

Police? What is this
about, Flynn?

Do you know this
Prince Valiant?

He's our new nanny.

Well, some no-goodnik
was trying to rob
poor Mr. Wong,

and boom!

We sure took him downtown,
didn't we, cutie?

Take good care of him.

Right.

Okay, so seeing you're
a local crime fighter,

I suppose the least
I could do is show
you around

and get you started
on the right foot.

Oh, there's no need for
you to miss work, Mom.

I can just take a
day off of school.

No, you're going
to school.

I will get them
started at work,

and I will be back here
to meet you at 9:00 sharp.

Your generosity
my dear lady is...

Yes, yes, yes,
fine, okay.

Love you.

[PLAYFUL GENTLE
MUSIC PLAYING]

The thing is,
Mom doesn't mean
to be bossy.

It's just that
after Dad died,

she took on a lot
of responsibility,

and this isn't
helping, is it?

No.

Hey, Zoe.

Hi, Sam.

Have a good weekend?

Sure. You?

Good.

Good.

And who might
this young robe be?

Flynn, this is Sam.

Sam, Flynn.

Hi.

My new nanny,
who was just going.

Yes.

Good luck with Mom.

And remember...

Of course.

Pleasure meeting you, Sam.

You know, I would have
figured him more for a butler

than a nanny,
but cool hat.

You're ready early.
I like that.

As I appreciate
your kindness.

Well, my kindness
is on the clock.

I have one hour
to give you.

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

You can't eat fish
if you can smell it.

It's bad.

Yeah?

Yeah. You don't
buy it.

If it's got a clear eye
and it's got smell...

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

Come on!

<i> â™ª Got these memories</i>

<i> â™ª Swimming laps
Around my head â™ª</i>

First, look at the fish.

Does it shine?

You want it to shine.

And then smell it.

A fish that's really
fresh is like clean water.

Young sir, what
pray tell are these?

Legs, old dude.

Fresh frog legs.

[DISGUSTED GROANS]

I guess I won't take him
to my butcher in Chinatown.

I'd hate to see what
a hanging Peking
duck does to him.

<i> â™ª So much love
Now from above â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª You're watching, dancing â™ª</i>

Oh, puka shell bracelets.

<i>â™ª Singing through this candle</i>

I had one of these
when I was Zoe's age.

My first boyfriend
gave it to me.

Right before
he broke up with me

because I wouldn't
French kiss him.


Enough foolishness.

<i> â™ª Paved the way
So I could grow â™ª</i>

GWEN: Well, we really don't
have time for this.

FLYNN: Oh yes, you do.
Everyone has time for

the Museum of the City
of San Francisco Toys!

Oh, please, you're
gonna love it!

You're gonna love it!

All right.

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

Be strong.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Ooh, help me!

<i> â™ª Stupid stories, photos</i>

Ow!

<i> â™ª It's all the same</i>

<i>â™ª But it's all that's left
And I'll make the claim that â™ª</i>

You've got to try this.

It's fantastic.

Oh no, it's fun.

Fine.

[BELL RINGS]

It's wild.

I'd like to see.

Ah, I think you're
gonna hit passionate.

Wild?

<i> â™ª So much love
Now from above</i>

<i> â™ª You're watching
Dancing with the wind</i>

<i> â™ª I'm singing through
This candle to you</i>

<i> â™ª Pray it's not just pretend</i>

<i>â™ª And burning for a little more</i>

<i> â™ª Of my best friend</i>

<i> â™ª You gave me music
Gave me soul â™ª</i>

Yeah, Alice, I'm just
gonna grab a quick bite.

No, no, everything's fine.

Breaking in my new nanny

is taking me a little
longer than expected.

I'll be five minutes.

I am delighted to pay.

You know, I haven't
taken a day off like this

in too many years.

You've actually got
me to break my routine

and just enjoy a simple
glass of wine with lunch.

And un repas sans vin et
comme au journÃ©e sans soleil.

A meal without wine
is like a day
without sunshine.

And a sight this spectacular
commands nothing less.

[BIRDS CAWING]

I live in such
a beautiful city,

and I never take the
time to enjoy it.

Thank you for slowing me
down for a bit, Flynn.

It is I who
thanks you, my lady.

For your kindness
and your trust.

To my sweet daughter then.

Mistress Zoe?

I could tell from
the start that...

she...cares for you.

And you for her.

So yes, to Mistress Zoe.

Yes.

Though I don't see
how anybody in their
right mind

goes from Oxford to nanny.

I suppose, um,

I've made it a point
to never question
the why in my life

but rather live
in the moment.

So leaving the
monarchy, it's just...

Your latest adventure.

In a manner of speaking.

Pardon my impudence,

but I can't help noticing
you still wear your ring.

Forgive my asking such
a personal question.

I don't--

No, no, it's okay.

It's...um...

It's that...it's that
Matt put it on me.

And I can't imagine
taking it off.

I know I'm such a clichÃ©.

The widow who never
stops mourning.

Never...

Never really moves on.

Zoe wants me to, and
Ruthie, and Stanley,

even I want me to, but...

I'm just stuck, I guess.

I don't know why I'm
telling you all this.

It's quite all right.
It's quite all right.

It's kind of
embarrassing, actually.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

ZOE: So, tell me.

Are you okay? Did things
go okay with Mom?

I suppose you could say
things went swimmingly.

No pun intended.

So will we be waiting
for your handsome chum

to retrieve his bike?

Where'd you get
that idea?

Let's go.

Oh, pity.

I myself was rather
hoping to speak
with him again.

Young Sam.

About what?

Well, you know, his
preference in bicycles,

where he has
his hair cut.

You.

Now don't play coy
with me, young Miss.

I know you're
keen on the lad.

So what if I am?

Every girl in seventh
grade likes him.

Ah hah, so that tart,
Kate, fancies him?

Zoe, with you in the game,

no other young Miss
stands a chance.

Especially one
so unpleasant.

Are you nuts?

Go up against her?

Mistress, if I have
learned anything

from the total
lack of courage

I too often display
in my books,

it's that if one
is unwilling

to put it all on
the line for love,

what good is the winning?

But what if Sam
doesn't like me
that way?

The way I like him?

I so want him to
be my Valentine.

Then into the breach
you must go, Zoe.

Heart wide open, ready to
take your bumps and bruises,

no foe keeping you
from your prize.

Sure, Flynn.

Flowery words sound great
coming from some Frog Prince.

But I'm just an
11-year-old girl.

I didn't grow up
in some castle.

I don't have subjects
calling me 'Your Majesty'.

<i>HILARY: Mother says I owe
it to her subjects</i>

<i> to always look majestic.</i>

<i> After all we are
going to be majesties.</i>

[GENTLE MUSIC]

Stanley, it's sweet
of you to worry,

but you're barking
up the wrong tree.

Well, I've called
around, Gwen.

Even Scotland Yard
and the princes

have had a Margaret
and a Mary,

and even a Hermione
as nannies.

Okay, so the royal family

has gone through
a lot of nannies.

They're all women, Gwen.

Not a man amongst them.

And no Flynn.

And as far as
these credentials,

a smart kid
with a computer

could print that
up in an afternoon.

I think Flynn is
a very nice man.

Zoe likes him.

I like him.

And I know if you met him,
you would like him, too.

I might,

but I'm gonna keep poking
around just to make sure.

Listen, I didn't say
I was gonna take
him downtown

for questioning,
Gwen, geez.

All right, but
I expect an apology
when you find out

how wonderful he is.

Huh. Zoe actually
finished her homework.

[WATER BUBBLING]

[FLYNN AND ZOE PLAY FIGHTING]

ZOE: Prepare
thyself, big brother.

FLYNN: Thou art no brother.

Vile thief who steals
my beauty, my love!

Ha! It is my heart
she desires.

GWEN: What is that I hear?

[FLYNN LAUGHS]

GWEN: Could it be my rescuer

coming to save me
from his castle keep?

Verily, it is I,
your Prince!

Do not be fooled!

For he loves none
as he loves himself,

and will only
bring you heartache

when he returns to the
bog and froggy hood.

What?

He gets turned
into a frog again.

Oh.

For green, green,
ye shall be.

Never to kiss
the lips of she.

Nay. Nay, the cure
is mine alone to give.

And I offer my kiss
so that he may live.

Then away I fly
to my lady's side.

Whoosh.

That's not how
the story goes.

Rewrite.

[DISHES CLANGING]

[FLYNN AND GWEN LAUGHING]

GWEN: I'm very
critical, so...

FLYNN: You?

GWEN: It's a big compliment.

You think I'm critical?

No, no, no, not at all.

Not at all?

No.

Not a bit?

Nope.

GWEN: I think
it's a good thing.

I think so, too.

I'm specific,
and you know what,

I know what I like.

Oh, oh, um [CHUCKLES]...

You've got soap
on your nose.

I know I must.

Hold on one second.

Oh, you've actually
got it here, too.

Thanks.

FLYNN: It's actually
quite a good look.

What do you think?

I like it.

I think it's
quite good.

Yeah, I like it.

Looks good on you.

[FLYNN MUMBLES]

GWEN: You look
good in my apron.

FLYNN: Thank you.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

I think we found her
someone special, Daddy.

Just in time for
Valentine's Day.

[WAVES CRASHING]

Mm, if it's not
strawberry,
what's the point?

Here, tell me
that's not the best.

Hm, while it's yummy,

my preference remains
the chocolate cherry.

Give me.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

Mm, you're both wrong.

Double bubble
espresso extra dark

is the only way to go.

[GWEN LAUGHS]

FLYNN: I'm a tea
man myself,

but I must admit,
that's dangerously good.

[GWEN LAUGHS]

[CABLE CAR BELL RINGS]

No. No.

GWEN: She was traumatized
by that. Sorry about that.

Allow me, my ladies.

Hey, hey, hey!

[ZOE LAUGHS]

Isn't that puddle a coat?

[ALL LAUGH]

Oh, umph!

<i>GWEN: I can't believe you
spent all your money</i>

<i> on ice cream and
the penny arcade.</i>

A gentleman
should not accept--

Great, just spare me the
Sir Walter Raleigh routine.

Okay now, it will
be your money.

No, I'm serious.

You can't keep
wearing the same
suit day after day

hoping the air line
find your bags.

This is far
too generous.

Just consider
the extra a bonus

for your first week
of excellent services.

You know, I think I
like the jeans better.

Turn around again.

Yeah, definitely
the jeans.

Mom, mom, there are
so many cute clothes
to choose from.

I can see that.

That's only half of the
ones I want to show you.

Come on, help me pick.

Something pretty caught
her fancy [CHUCKLES].

More like
something pretty

to catch some
lucky boy's fancy.

Well, I was just like
your daughter at that age.

Boys and clothes.

BOTH: Oh, we're not to...

I'll be right back.

HILARY: Mother, must you
be so annoying?

You're really
trying my patience.

I shan't tolerate
such tardiness.

Especially when I'm
going to be Your Majesty.

If you insist on
throwing away
your future...

I'm not throwing
away my future.

I'm surrendering to it.

Thank you.

Thank you, you...

And the ring.

Oh!

Ha! Fancy bumping into you.

And here of all places.

Come on. What
a lovely surprise!

I'm so thrilled.

Cash or charge?

Cripes!

<i>FLYNN: Dearest
Mistress Zoe,</i>

<i> I address this to you

<i> as it is you I
primarily deceived.</i>

<i> As you will unfortunately
soon discover,</i>

<i> I was not whom or what</i>

<i> we, for a time,

<i> All I will say in my defense
is that I had amnesia</i>

<i> and was truly
without my memory</i>

<i> when you came upon me.</i>

<i> The result of
severe punishments</i>

<i> served by a pair of brutes.</i>

<i> For demonstrating
has always been my
true selfish character,</i>

<i> and thus, justly deserved.</i>

<i> I never meant to take

and forgive me.</i>

[POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING]

[CABLE CAR BELL DINGS]

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

Good morning!

Flynn?

Flynn?

Good morning.

No breakfast?

Ouch.

Somebody didn't
sleep last night.

Bad dreams?

I know you prefer tea,

but what you need
is a good, strong
cup of coffee.

And my egg scramble
to go with it,

and I do mean egg scramble
and not scrambled eggs.

Big difference.

Lady Gwendolyn,
there's something
that I must tell you.

I used to make this
for Zoe all the time.

She loves the little
veggies I put in,

but after 12 hours on my
feet in a hot kitchen...

Tie my bow,
will you, Flynn?

I've got to look my
best for the party.

FLYNN: Into the breach?

Heart wide open?

No, just giving
Sam a card.

That he's gonna love.

I know it.

I gotta make
it right now.

Egg scramble?

No way, Mom.

This is gonna be
the best day ever.

What was it you
wanted to say to me?

Nothing, my lady.

Nothing.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

[PHONE RINGS]

Cole residence.

Sir Stanley [CHUCKLES]!

To what do I
owe this honor?

He either already
knows what's what.

Or I tell him.

Right.

Would you look at the
size of that firearm?

Right.

Stanley!

I don't believe we've
had the chance...

Flynn!
You made it!

Alice, I want you
to meet the guy
that fixed my kid.

Flynn. Alice.

You know for years
I was begging Jason

please, don't play
with your food!

Oh, I could kiss you.

Pleasure to
meet you, ma'am.

Pleasure to
meet you, too.

We won't need those.

No?

I'll have the usual,
and one for my friend here.

I hope you like a
hearty gravy, sir.

[LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]

I mean sure,
I have my doubts.

But the way Gwen
goes on about you.

And my Ruthie has
been a little more
than frisky lately.

Since she doesn't
have to worry

about her kid
sister anymore.

How could you and I
not be buddies?

So we're on
for Thursday?

Bowl-a-rama,
you and me.

ALICE: Anything else?

Oh, another piece
of pie, please.

You know, you were right.

He's a stand-up guy.

I knew you'd
feel that way.

And thank you for caring.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

Okay, put your
cards in the cubbies!

No passing them out now.

We'll get to them
after lunch.

Whoo! [GIGGLES]

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

Okay, go!

Go get your valentines!

[POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING]

KATE: Oh, Sam, I
bought these just for you.

Zoe?

[POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING]

Hi, Zoe.

Mistress, what's
the matter?

Zoe!

Zoe!

Mistress?

You asked me, commanded me
to let you be, but I cannot.

If you don't let
me try and help...

[DOOR SLAMS]

Why can't you
just leave me alone?

FLYNN: Because I am
your friend.

ZOE: Some friend.

Look at what all
your stupid talk

about taking a chance
on love got me.

Go on, look!

Oh, Zoe, I'm so
deeply sorry that

my interference
brought you pain.

You know I would gladly
suffer an eternity

to undo the hurt
I've caused you.

But you must know this.

You are a smart,
beautiful young lady.

And any lad who
does not recognize this
and cherish you,

well, he's both
blind and a fool.

To treat the expression
of your gentle heart

in such a manner reflects
only on his character,

and I would, I would defend
your honor with my life.

Come here.

Come here, come here.

[ZOE SOBS]

Not her best day
ever, huh?

It's enough to
break one's heart.

I know just how
to fix that.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

Oh, Mistress Zoe,
look what I found.

To Zoe.

"There was once
a girl I knew

who wished
the moon was blue.

I needed her help,
as covered in kelp

I was quite the hullabaloo.

Happy Valentine's Day.

From Flynn".

And one for my lady.

"To Gwen,

you need to laugh
every day

Check [LAUGHS].

You need to take
time for you.

Check.

You need to speak
French more often.

[FLYNN LAUGHS]
Check.

Won't you be my valentine?

Would you please
put check?

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

Goodnight.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

You loathsome coward, you.

Do you always
talk to yourself?

I suppose I do, yes.

A bit of a habit.

Flynn, it's clean.

Even Mrs. Polanski
would approve.

Would you give it a rest?

I wanted to tell
you this earlier,

but Zoe was so upset.

And I kind of needed
the time to think about

what you did
and said to her.

It is I who must
talk to you about...

Please, please,
just listen.

It's been a long time
since I've had
someone in my life

I could really count on.

Someone who loves
Zoe as much as I do.

And hearing you
pledge your strength
and commitment

to my child,

and the respect
you have for her,

it's more than I could
want in any father.

From any man.

I know we've just met,

and I know this is very

inappropriate and forward,

but...

I feel something
between us.

Something good
and special

that I know you feel, too.

I cannot find
the words, though.

The words that
will allow me

to spend the rest
of my life here

exactly as it is
right now.

Who says you can't?

Fate.

Fate is what
we make it.

What's going on?

So, this is where
we find you.

Flynn, do you
know these people?

MOTHER: There is no Flynn.

This is our son, Percival.

The Marquis of Summerland.

I so wanted--I
tried to tell you.

There's no need
for histrionics.

I'm not hysterical.

Oh, of course you are.

And to what end?

You know your place.

What's expected of you.

And that is that.

Percy, we are
finished here.

[POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING]

Thanks for trying.

[POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING]

[DOOR CREAKS AND SLAMS]

PERCY: I mean tonight.

You pick tonight of all
nights to abandon me?

I don't know what
to do, Wilkins.

You can't just
leave me like this.

I must, dear boy.

For life awaits.

Are you aware that
if you drop a frog
into boiling water

it will hop right out?

None the worse for wear.

However, if you drop
the very same frog

into cool water and
then gradually increase
the temperature,

it will not perceive
the danger it is in

until it's too late.

And the poor fool
will boil to death.

Now, I will set about
seeing forthwith

that I do not meet
such a fate.

And I heartedly suggest
that you do the same.

I'll miss you, Wilkins.

Naturally, you
will write weekly.

As you told me.

In longhand, cursive
and to the point.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

<i> â™ª I will wait</i>

<i> â™ª For you</i>

<i> â™ª I will wait</i>

<i> â™ª For you</i>

<i> â™ª Snowflakes on the trees</i>

<i> â™ª The last few
Colors of the leaves</i>

<i> â™ª Make me want to stay â™ª</i>

GWEN: Great, I just need
a couple of hours.

I'll call when I'm
on my way in, Alice.

<i> â™ª We're just what you
need don't go away â™ª</i>

[PHONE RINGS]

Ruthie, I'm done.

All talked out.

Okay, love you, goodbye.

I made oatmeal.

Mom, I told you
I'm not hungry.

I made oatmeal.

I've been thinking a lot.

I spoke with Mrs. Bieker.

She's going to sit
with you here today.

Sure, whatever. It's just
that I get it now.

He wasn't a prince.

Well, he was sort of,
but not that prince.

Uh-huh.

Uncle Stanley said
Flynn was mugged.

That he must have
had amnesia.

But you saw his face
when they caught him.

He was a frog.

Fraud. A fraud.

But he knew
who he really was.

He knew he was busted.

That's what
I saw in his face.

Forget him.

But Flynn was
part of our family.

Flynn was only
make believe.

Nothing about him
was real.

Then why did he
stay here so long?

Why did he care
so much about us?

Haven't you
even wondered?

Okay, sweetie,
I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna lay down

and I'm gonna rest
my eyes, okay?

I'm sorry, Mommy.

<i> â™ª Told you many times before</i>

I'm sorry, too, sweetie.

<i> â™ª ...Love you more than
Stars up in the sky</i>

<i>â™ª Why they mean so little now</i>

<i> â™ª I do not understand
How or why</i>

<i> â™ª But I will wait</i>

<i> â™ª For you</i>

<i> â™ª I will wait</i>

<i> â™ª For you</i>

<i> â™ª Wake up in the morning</i>

<i> â™ª Feeling strange
What has changed</i>

<i> â™ª It feels like frost â™ª</i>

Oh, Zoe, I'm so sorry
your Mr. Flynn

turned out to be
a lousy rat.

I thought
he was an amphibian.

Oh, whatever he
was, don't worry.

If he so much
as dares to show
his face around here,

keeech, lights out,
Casanova.

Zoe, I didn't
rip up your card.

It was Kate.

She even admitted it.

Would you wait?
I'm trying to explain!

I brought you
your valentine.

You're kidding me, right?

I've been standing
around here all morning.

Sam, this really
isn't the time, okay?

I just don't
want to hear...

Zoe.

You came back!

You came back!

Oh! Will you ever
forgive me, child?

Oh, how I pray
that you do.

It's not me you
have to worry about.

She's home, then?

With a splitting headache,
a little mood to go with it.

Well then to her
side I must go.

That's not going
to be very easy.

Mrs. B's staked
out in the lobby
playing watchman.

Uncle Stanley has already
been by twice this morning,

so even if you
could get in...

Not could. Must.

Or give my life
in the try.

SAM: I could help you.

That is, if you're
willing to let me,

and if you're brave
enough to try.

Brave, how?

[DRAMATIC MUSIC TONES]

ZOE: Is there a problem?

Ugh.

[PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING]

Here, this should help.

SAM: Ahhh!

[SAM AND PERCY GRUNT]

What did you eat
for breakfast today?


[LADDER CREAKS]

Into the breach,
heart wide open.

For luck.

Luck.

Luck, yeah.

Yes.

I so badly need it.

Oh, God!

[GENTLE DRAMATIC
MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>WILKINS: Steady, sir.</i>

<i> A bit close for my comfort
given your vertigo.</i>

All right.

[RAPID HEARTBEATS]

Okay.

Oh!

Oh!

[RAPID HEARTBEATS]

No, fear not!

Your lady waits.

Come on, Percy!

Umph!

[HEARTBEAT SLOWS]

Zounds.

You!

What are you doing
here in my apartment?

Don't make me
get my purse!

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

GWEN: Zoe, I'm trying
to get some rest, sweetie!

The door is open!
Just let yourself in!

Gwendolyn!

I'll call the police!

Let them come.

I fear no justice for
the wrongs I've done

during our brief time
and budding courtship.

Our what?

Our courtship?

How full of yourself
are you?

Too full and for
far too long.

I've spent my
entire adult life
shirking responsibility.

Caring only for my own
comfort and my ease.

And never, until
now, felt regret.

Well, you can just
regret yourself
right out of here.

Verily, I'll away,
but not before

you hear what I
carry in my heart.

Okay, will you stop with
the Shakespeare already?

Just spit it out, Percy.

Percy is no more.

And Flynn,
he has fallen madly,

wildly and deeply
in love with you.

Really?

Does your fiancee know?

I have no fiancee.

Oh, so she wised up, too.

Good for her.

Indeed.

And smart enough
to know

that for any marriage
to truly blossom

it must take root
in true love.

True love? Like in
fairy tale land

where people fall
topsy-turvy in love

with peppermint tomorrows.

From what Zoe told me,

you are the very woman
who went to collect a tip

only to find
a note reading,

"The best tip I can give
you is to marry me."

Love becomes no sweeter.

Matthew was a
real prince.

You're--

An impostor?

Guilty as charged.

But can you
honestly tell me after
all that's happened,

all that's been said, that
you're not pretending?

That maybe, just maybe,

I'm the man,
not the prince,

not the king that
you've been dreaming of.

A man with his heart
wide open,

who is committed
and determined to be

worthy of a love
that only comes along

once in a blue moon.

To be worthy
of you...forever.

Would you
kiss her already?

<i>ZOE: And so
it came to pass</i>

<i> that City by the
Bay fell in love</i>

<i>with her own little Lily Pad.</i>

[PEOPLE TALKING]

<i> Named for my
baby sister, Lily.</i>

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

<i> While the princess who
made it all happen,</i>

<i> moi, is doing okay, too.</i>

<i> But seeing my guy is,</i>

<i> well, you know how boys are.</i>

<i> I can't be sure if he's
going to be a prince</i>

<i> or just a charming toad
giving flavor to my life.</i>

Want some gum?

Strawberry?

Sweet.

[GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>ZOE: And they all
lived happily ever after.</i>

<i> Well, mostly happily
ever after,</i>

<i> which is about all you can
really expect out of life.</i>
