Ain't gonna go, Austin.
Changed my mind.

She's a witch.

She ain't no witch, Donnie.

Ain't nothing up there,
but a stupid old lady...

who likes to give
presents to kids.

Everybody says she
don't want people seeing her...

on account of that
disease made her ugly.

You go up there,
I'm telling Pa.

Pa ain't gonna let us keep
no bicycle.

Fine, if you're such a
fraidy cat, then stay here.

Hello, Ms. Craven?

It's Austin Carter,
from down the road.

You left me a letter.
I'm here for the bicycle.

Are you alone?
Does anybody know you came?

It has to be a secret.

All alone, ma'am.
Nobody knows.

Nothing to be afraid of.

A trade's a trade.

Tooth first...

then a shiny new bicycle.

It's okay, child.
Just the wind.

Where are you?
I can't see you.

Step to the parlor.
No need to see me, child.

Where's the bike?
I came because of the bicycle.

I must have my tooth first.
A bargain is a bargain.

But it ain't come out yet.

There's a string on the table there.
Tie it 'round your tooth.

We'll pull it out.

I ain't doing this
'less I see the bike first.

I wouldn't lie, child.

The bike's right here.

Wow! A Schwinn.

She's a beaut.

I must have my tooth first.

I've done this many times.

The last tooth
is always the easiest.

Are we ready?

Now close your eyes
and get your prize.

CAMPBELL INN
BED AND BREAKFAST

Well... It's about time.

Yeah, sorry that took so long, Peter.

They ran out of hydrangeas
over at Sherman's Outdoors...

so I had to drive all the way over
to Twin Oaks.

We got a lot to do
before July first.

I couldn't do without you, Bobby.

All the kids I hired me the job
are just finding some shade.

I appreciate
all your hard work.

I have been looking at that
antique chipper thing in the woodshed.

Yeah. well. Y'know I'm thinking
of having that thing carted out of there.

It's a piece of junk.

I think I could fix it.
Pretty good with engines.

Threw a new battery in it this morning.
Just looks like it needs a lube.

Maybe after dinner,
I could see if I could get it running.

I could use it shred all that underbrush
we've been cutting outta there...

instead of hauling all on out of here by truck.

Alright, well, give it a shot.

Where the hell are they?

Hey! Pam-bam, look at this map
and see if you can find River Bend Road.

I could use a little help, Pammy.

I'm in East Oz here.
Nothing looks like the map.

Can I ask you a question?
Never stopped you before.

I think I'm going back to "Pamela".

"Pammy" seems so...
so lower school.

I thought you hated "Pamela".

I know you like pet names
like "Pam-bam" and "Pammy"...

but now that I'm ten and a half,
I think I'm a bit too old for that.

I love the name "Pamela".
That's why dad and I picked it.

Then, it's settled.

So, Pamela,
you see this road on that map?

I'm really pretty lost here.

Why don't you ask at that station?
You said you needed gas.

Okay.

Hello?

Please little help out here!

We need some directions.

Need some directions?

We're lost.

Get the hell out of that garage.
Leave her be.

She don't talk to strangers.

I'm..I'm looking for River Bend Road.
You ain't gonna find it in there.

Watcha gonna do, Chuck?
Shut up, Henry.

This map you got is as useless as
tits on fore-truck.

Now, get on outta there. Leave her be.
I ain't gonna say it twice.

I'm looking for a new bed and breakfast inn,
just outside of Constitution.

Should be near River Bend Road.
That's what Peter said.

Son of a bitch! Right, Chuck?
Shut up, Henry.

This Peter guy isn't by any chance
Peter "Step on my Dick" Campbell?

I'm sorry What?
What kind of business you got with that
melted down piece of shit?

Here's a fact of life, missy.

When you hang with shit,
you smell like shit.

Excuse me, but I won't appreciate
that kind of language.

Pammy, we're leaving!
What are we gonna do, Chuck?

Pammy!

Pammy!
It's "Pamela", mom. Remember?

Come on, honey.
Come on.

Hey you ain't paid for your gas.
Yeah! Ain't paid!

Is she Peter Campbell?

Is that raised on concrete motherfucker
you're good for nothing pa?

My daddy's dead.
Get in the car, honey.

Let me go!
Because of your boyfriend Peter...

the Chamber of Commerce had threat
to fuck over our property.

He thinks this is over,
but this ain't never gonna be over.

There's bad shit coming.
Get off me!

Leave my mommy alone!
What are you gonna do, Chuck?

You're gonna run around back
and pull down her panties?

Can I have seconds?

-Depends on how...
Get off me!

she is when I'm through.
Get off me!

Damn!

Get off me!

Get her! Goddammit!

This ain't over!

Finally.

He-hey! Are those my girls?

Would you give me a hand
with this, uh, suitcase?

Got a lot of stuff.

Excuse me, but, you know,
we're not open yet.

Doug Freeman, at the bank,
said July 1 but I...

I let my place in town go and figured what's
6 or 7 days in the course of a lifetime.

I'm.. I'm Star Roberts;
I'm leasing a room.

I'm sorry, I thought your name
was "Stephanie".

Oh, it is Stephanie.
Stephanie Thorne Amanda Roberts.

S-T-A-R. "Star".
Get it?

Yeah. You know Mr. Freeman told
me you were going to Veterinary school...

down in Twin Oaks and you'd be leasing
a room only on the weekends.

He also said that you
were his, uhm, niece.

Yeah. All that's true.

Except for the niece part.

I used to dance on the Greased Monkey
in town...

and Mr. Freeman
was a happy hour regular...

but, uh, Iâ€™ve saved up enough
to retire from showbiz, so...

I'm going to Veterinary College.
New worlds to conquer, you know?

Sure.

Yeah, I hope me coming a week early isn't
gonna a big inconvenience.

We had a lease,
so, we'll make it work.

Thank you, you're a doll.
Sure.

Love it here.

Hey... look at those little guys.

I think they're called, uh,
Ruby-throated Archilochus colubris...

but hummingbirds have to eat four times
their weight in food everyday...

to just have enough energy to fly like that.

I'm taking aviary species
first semester.

I gotta jump start this summer
and read my text books.

Sure.
I love it.

Hey, Mr. C., where do you want
the rest of these flower..whoa.

Bobby Boulet, meet
Stephanie Roberts.

Hey!

Whoa, sorry.
He's been helping me fix the place up.

Call me "Star".

Alright, Bobby,
you can close your mouth, now...

and maybe, help Star with her bags?

Got it.

Your room is just up there on the...
the left.

Great, thanks.
Okay.

Mr. C., she's a hottie.

I'm telling you, if that's your first tenant
you hit the *jackpot.

Just keep it in your pants.
Yeah.

I missed you!

Okay, so...

what do you think?

It's so big.

It is big.

Y'know it's a little run down,
but I think it's getting there.

Why don't you go and check it out?
Okay.

Hi.
Hello.

I was a little worried about you.
You said 10 o'clock, it is almost...1.

We got lost.

Oy, talk about your fixer-upper.

It's not as bad
as it looks.

Believe me, it's a whole lot better than it was.

Your gas cap's off.

Darc, what happened?
I'm still shaking.

I pulled into a gas station
10 miles back...

to Bubba's who looked like
extras from "Deliverance" run the place.

The minute I mentioned I was coming up here,
they attacked me.

They  were about to rape me,
I almost didn't get away.

What?

I'm sorry, I should've
told you not to stop there.

Are you okay?
I'll feel better once I file charges.

What the hell's their problem?
That is a long story.

Let's just get you settled in, okay?

Mark.

The Morrison-Calley lawsuit just
finished pre-trial *daps.

Case got fast-tracked
so it's all over us.

If paralegal jobs weren't
so scarce right now...

I'd be out of there.

Well, I'm glad you're here.

You should've seen this place before, Darc.
The windows were painted black...

and all the mirrors inside
were covered over.

I'm telling you: You give me another week,
and you won't even recognize this place.

Now, that should help take the edge off.

Yeah.

Thanks.
Sure.

So, what do you really think of the place?

Once it's cleaned up, I think,
it'll be fine.

You know when I was working in Pediatrics,
that's how we used to describe ugly babies.

Come on, Peter, I'm up here.
I brought Pammy.

I kept my end of the bargain.

You're making it sound like
you have to take medicine.

It's your prescription.
You're the doctor, or at least you were.

Darc, come on! We've been
over this a thousand times.

I made a shitty doctor.

My heart was not in it.

You said you were gonna fill me in.

So... who are the idiots
who broke my window?

Those idiots were the
Hammond brothers.

They were squatting in the property with
their sister Maude when I bought the place...

so I had to get the municipal
court to kick them out.

And needless to say they
weren't happy about it.

Listen, let's...
Let's talk about you and I...

It...

What is it, Mark?

No, No, Brian has those papers.

Great.
I gave it to him before I left.

Hello! Anybody in here?

Wow!

It's a 1949 Schwinn.

Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

I'm from down the lane,
but you can't tell.

I'm supposed to be at home doing chores.

You live on a farm?
Yeah, about a mile from here.

Are there horses?

I've taken riding lessons,
English saddle.

We had horses once but they died.
I love horses.

This bike's got the new style.

Toolbox tank with the battery
clipped in switch built right in.

What if we can get these
tires and filled them?

Bicycle pump, right over there!

You just wonder into other
people's houses without asking?

In a house,
it's a woodshed.

I was just wondering
who's moving in. That's all.

Peter Campbell.
He and my mom used to be engaged.

He was a doctor then.
Now, he quit.

He just writes short stories.

Are you moving in, too?

There's not many kids to play with
around here. We could be friends.

Me and my mom are just here
for the weekend.

I was worried there won't be any kids...

so, I'm glad you came over.

I'm Emma Inge.
Pamela Wagner.

Wanna play dress-up?

Why don't we get this bike
working first?

Get it cleaned up
and go exploring.

You gotta stop, Pamela.
Why?

This is Witch's River.
It's haunted.

How old are you?
I'll be 11 in February.

Me, too. Mommy says we Aquarians
have active imaginations...

but, I think we're both too old
to believe in witches, Emma.

Do you have any baby teeth left?
So what if I do?

But it's just one,
so, it barely counts.

Best not to pull it 'til you're safe
at home. The witch collects teeth.

How does she do that?
Bad luck to talk about it.

Like Voldemort
in "Harry Potter"?

Who's Harry Potter?

"Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone".

"Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets"?

J.K. Rowling?

My parents died when I was 6.

I ain't allowed to leave the farm much,
so, I don't hear about a lot of things.

Yeah, but still, Harry Potter!

Okay. Go on.
Tell me about that silly old witch.

She used to live in the
house you're in...

a long time ago.

When she was alive,
she had a horrible disease.

Tumors grew in her mouth
and on her face.

Children teased her when
she went to school.

After her parents died,
she covered all the mirrors in the house...

and painted all the windows black
and never came out.

But as she got old,
she got meaner.

She started luring
children up there...

taking their teeth and killing them.

She'd put their teeth in
her magic music box...

and curse the children
so their souls would be trapped...

to wander the earth, forever.

And that's why they called her,
the Tooth Fairy.

And you say you never read
Harry Potter.

I have to get home before dark.

You better get home, too.

You be careful, Pamela.

Don't let the tooth fairy
have your last tooth.

She knows when they're loose.
When she has it...

she'll kill you.

Pam!

Is she upstairs?
No. No.

Pammy!

I'll check the woodshed.
She's not there, I already checked.

What's the fuss?
My daughter's missing.

I'll help you look.
Star and I can jump in the truck,
maybe we could...

No, no, Bobby, let's go check back here.
I used to live in this area. I know these roads.

I'll, I'll drive.

Stephanie, I'm Darcy.
Hi, nice to know you.

What was she wearing?
Jeans and a, a blue hoodie.

It's been a cold July.
Hope she's warm enough.

Is that her?

Peter, she's here!

Thank God I found you.
What happened to your mouth?

I fell, I knocked out my last baby tooth.

Good going, kiddo.

School picture's coming up in a week
and now you have a big hole in your smile.

Once she has your tooth,
she'll kill you.

I met this girl today,
her name's Emma Inge.

She lives on a farm
about a mile from here.

I was going to invite her over tomorrow...

so I asked Bobby about her.

He lives in town...

but he said he'd never heard
of an Inge family.

It's kinda strange, huh?
I never saw you playing with a girl.

Was she nice?
Yeah, but...

she dresses kinda weird.

Well... this is the country, sweetheart.
It's a long way to Melrose Avenue.

Do you believe in witches, mommy?

A life isn't a Harry Potter novel, Pamela.

But, didn't they use to burn
witches in Salem, Massachusetts?

In Salem, they didn't
understand disease...

and why so many babies were
dying during childbirth.

Since they couldn't understand it,
they found people who didn't fit in...

and called them witches and
burned them at the stake...

hoping to make their problems go away.

And, what's all this about?

Emma says there used to be a witch
that lived on this house.

Right here, in this house.

Well, she's not here anymore.

Okay?

Now it's time for you,
to go to sleep.

Leave the light on in the hall.

Okay.

Nice night.

I couldn't concentrate in this book
in my room for some reason.

Listen to what I just found.

<i>"Pigeons were originally brought to
this country as pets...</i>

<i>but they escaped and formed
feral populations...</i>

<i>that are now the number 1
pest bird in the US."</i>

I didn't know that, did you?
Yeah.

Yeah?

I mean, no.
No, I...

I'm not sure.

I always loved animals.

Even as a kid, I used to have all kinds of
broken birds, and sick lizards and stuff...

and nurse them back to health.

I...

I was always kind of your
girl-geek type, you know.

Then I started growin' up...

This is what I ended up with.

Yeah...

no kiddin', huh?

It's funny how you can end up
becoming what it is you look like...

but underneath all this,
I'm still just Star Roberts, girl geek.

Took me a mess of time to get
that sorted out, but...

I'm on the right track now,
and I can't hardly wait to start my classes.

I play football.

Won league championships this year.

Really?
Yeah.

Got a scholarship at Fresno State.

Start two-day drills in about a week.
What are you gonna study?

I thought I'd try
Electrical Engineering...

my folks, they wanted me in
Farm Management, but...

I don't know if I wanna be in Farm
Management the rest of my life.

Just 'cause you live on a farm and look like a
farm boy, doesn't mean you have to be one, right?

And take it from somebody who
just took a 3-year detour.

Your dreams will carry you but,
you gotta be willing to fly first.

It's so nice here.

I love it.

<i>Mommy!
Mommy, where are you?</i>

Who's that?
Who's there?

Uh, shut it.
Hush up!

You'll raise the dead.

Let go of her!

Who are you?

Mrs. MacDonald.
Your next-door neighbor.

What're you doing sneaking around up here?
It's almost midnight.

What's going on?
Who was screaming?

You must listen to me, all of you.

Your lives are in great danger.

This house is a place of untold evil.

Awful things have transpired here.

Unspeakable things to children!

She was in my room.
Nonsense, child!

I saw you. You were leaning over my bed,
you tried to get my tooth.

That was not me...

it was her.

What do you mean "her"?
Who the hell are you talking about?

The evil one is awake.

All this work on the house has
disturbed her slumber.

And now, she will take
revenge on all of you.

Mark my words,
all who stay...

will die.

Pammy, I don't want you listening to this.
Come on.

Listen, Mrs. MacDonald...

I want you off of my property.

I don't care if you are
my neighbor...

you don't come sneaking around here
scaring that little girl half to death.

Well I have seen the witch, and I know.

All of you must leave...

before it's too late.

At least we know who not to
borrow a cup of sugar from.

Yeah!

Yeah!

He shoots, he scores!

Who is that?

Ms. MacDonald?

Peter doesn't want you
'round here anymore.

Mommy!
What?

Did you hear that?
Yeah.

Sounded like it came from the woodshed.

Come on, let's go.

Okay, listen. Darc, I want you to stay
here with Star and Pam, okay?

I'll be right back.
Okay.

Bobby?

The hell...

Excuse me, folks.

I'm gonna have the coroner pick up
the whole ? to town.

But, uh, the contraption turned that
poor boy into tomato puree.

You say he was fixing it?
Yeah, the engine was all busted up...

but Bobby figured he could get it going, so.

Must have had his head down there.

Some damn thing try to free the chopper wheel
turned on by mistake and got pulled in.

That boy was a football player and a half.
It's a damn shame.

He wanted to study Engineering.

Why don't you folks go on back to the house?
I'll let you know when we're ready to leave.

Thanks.

Come on, Star.

D'you want to talk about this?
Can't even bear to think about it.

Later, then.
But I don't think you should bury it.

We need to talk about what happened.

I don't want it to give you nightmares.

I'm too afraid to go
upstairs or go to sleep.

I understand, but you have to try.

She was in my room, mom.

Mrs. MacDonald won't come back.
Peter made her go away.

I think she's the witch
who killed Bobby.

There's no such thing as witches.

But if she's not a witch, how'd
she know my tooth was gone?

Emma says she always knows.

And when she gets my tooth...

she'll kill me.

You can't let your imagination
run away with you, honey.

And Mrs. MacDonald
is just a crazy old lady.

We'll lock up tight.
She won't get in again, I promise.

Come here.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Fine.

How could something like that happen?

How's Pammy?

Not so hot.

Now that this has happened,
I don't know if I feel...

the same way about this place.

Maybe moving up here
to be a writer...

wasn't such a hot idea after all.

Maybe this whole thing was a big mistake.

No, you gotta do what you want.

I don't wanna put any pressure on you,
but Pammy and I...

would love to have you come home.

Can't you write stories anywhere?

Does it have to be in some inn
way out in the country?

Look, I admit that...

you know, this place hasn't
been very peaceful...

but, trust me, Darc...

I will not let anything
happen to you or Pam.

Come here.

Peter?

Yeah.

Where's my car?

It was right there when the cops left.

What kind of whack job takes a Hyundai?

One of the reasons you drive those things
is because no one ever steals them.

I got a hunch.
It's the kind of lame...

crappers dipshit Hammond
brothers would be pulling.

Sheriff Pepper, please.

Well, when will he be back?

Okay. Thank you.

Won't be back 'til noon.

We'll wait 'till Pammy gets up
and we'll take a trip into town.

Thanks.

To put a little sugar in your day.

Thanks, Peter.
You're welcome.

Now why don't you go check out
some of those cool sunglasses...

and your mom and I are going
to talk to the Sheriff, okay?

Okay.
See you in a minute.

Meet me in the changing room.

You'll never believe what
happened last night.

Bobby Boulet died,
it's all over town.

And the tooth fairy, she was in my
room, she tried to get my tooth.

She can't come after you
unless your tooth is out.

As long as it's in your
mouth, you're safe.

I fell off the bike, I knocked it out.
And last night...

<i>Only one person in the change
room at a time.</i>

I'm sorry, I'm all alone.
It's just my radio, I'll turn it off.

I'm so scared,
She almost got me.

And now,
she's after this tooth.

Now that the tooth fairy
wants that tooth...

she'll come after you wherever you go.

You're not safe unless we stop her.
How can we stop her?

If we give her your tooth,
she'll lead us to the magic music box.

That's where she keeps the teeth.

Once we have the music box,
I think her spell's broken.

Once she gets my tooth,
she'll kill me.

She can't bear to look at herself.

Yes, but how would that
keep me alive?

We can use that,
we just have to be very, very clever.

He had been as involved as one of
Mark's notorious sleeping jurors.

Well, they got their hands full with
the media over Bobby's death.

And my car's probably halfway
to Bolivia by now.

Maybe not.

Wonder if they took anything?

How do you unhook this thing?
You don't unhook.

Oh, we got ourselves a
full-fledged innkeeper.

What're you gonna do, Chuck?
I want my car back.

You trespassed on private property
and stole it. That's against the law.

Well, I found this in
your backseat, missy.

It says here you're a paralegal.
It's some kind of lawyer's helper, ain't it?

See I'm figuring that this means you 
understand the concept of a mechanic's lien.

Well, me and my brother, we for one,
have thingamabob's your new car here...

on account of you took off
without paying for your gas.

Bullshit!
Darc.

Hey, shut up. And you,
keep your trap shut as well...

I'm gonna fill a hole in one of
my size 13 Danner boots.

She didn't pay for her gas,
and so we impounded the car.

Of course, calling this roller skate
a car is a might bit of a stretch...

but what the fuck, takes what
the good Lord provides.

If she owes you money
for gas, I'll pay it.

You obviously don't hear
too good, Mr. Pete.

I said just shut up.

This ain't some city court proceeding
where bullshit flows downhill...

and honest folks who miss a few
payments on their house get...

run off like a rabid dogs.

You were squatting on my property.

And now just, unhook the car, asshole.

"Unhook the car, asshole."

Sounds like Mr. Pete needs
to get took down a notch.

Don't get into a fight over this.
Pete, we'll just go to the sheriff!

You mean cousin Claude?

Well that ain't gonna work out quite
like how you think. So go ahead,

see if you can take back your
Korean leaf blower with windows.

But I best warn you,
when the shit jumps off...

I am the hammer and
you're that dog shit.

Peter!

Stop it!

I said stop it!

Feisty little beaver, aren't you?

You son of a bitch.

Come on, Darc.
Come on, let's go home.

Wait a minute.

Go onto our property again,
I'll shoot your balls off..

Cherise?
Yeah.

Hey, Cherise. Come on out,
they're back.

Are you sure this guy
isn't like the other friend the...

Luis character, with
that meth habit?

You're gonna love Pete. His chakra
is as blue as a mountain lake.

He been my main man
since high school.

He-hey Darc, Pammy.

Cole.
What's up?

O, what's the 411,
someone thrown in on you?

No, I just had a little
misunderstanding in town.

So, what are you doing here?
You asked me to come up and help, remember?

Yeah, but I thought you
said you had a gig.

Tomorrow.

Cherise, meet the big dog.
This is Cherise Lowe.

We hired her on as a roadie
for Praying Mantis, y'know.

she puts stuff up,
takes shit down...

sells CDs and t-shirts in the lobbies,
and sometimes on the street.

I also read chakras
and adjust auras.

We sure could've used some
aura-adjusting yesterday.

I thought your gig was up in Portland.
Wouldn't wanna miss the grand opening.

The grand opening's July 1st.

Oops.

My bad, come here,
give me a hug.

Right.

Look, I'm glad you're here.

I'm just gonna go inside and
get some ice on this.

Yeah, I hope you put the other
guy in the hospital.

Well, it was "guys", actually.

You can say we did
adjust their auras.

Your personal landscape is a
manuscript written by your actions.

When you fight, you always
lose more than you redeem.

Thanks.

But he sorta had to be there.
Come on, Pammy.

Listen.

A transcendent evil has
been awaken in this house...

and it started to assert its will.

Tell me about it.

Easy on the freaky shit.

Man!

The worst part is, he was gonna
start in a college in a week.

So much to live for.

Well...

It kinda sucks, the big one!

So sad, I wish I could stop
thinking about it.

It really bums me out.

I totally understand.

What kind of music do you play?

It's an alternative country rap.
It's a genre I created myself.

I always wanted to play an instrument,
but, God didn't give me that gift.

And I think I'm tone-deaf.

Oh you might be tone-deaf,
but you scored in some other departments.

I mean look at you.
You're fucking gorgeous.

God gave you plenty,
I mean, forget music.

You should be a model or something.

No, I already tried that.
Modeling's for losers.

I'm going to be a veterinarian.
Starting school next week.

That is so cool.

You think so?
Yeah.

Most guys try to talk me out of it.
They want me stay just the way I am.

Not me, man, no.
So many girls...

only think about is
dumb stuff like...

"How's my hair look?"
"Are my boobs too small?", you know?

"Do I look fat in this?"

It gets real old because
it's always about them.

I mean, to be truly beautiful...

you're gonna give the best part
of yourself to others.

You can't see real beauty.

It's transcendent.

This is very insightful...

and so...

poetic.

I'm a song writer, so...

poetry kinda comes with the territory.

Hey, who wants wine?

None for me, thanks.

I have two chapters
to get through tonight.

Good night.
Night.

Some things never change, do they?

Thank you.

Cole, I wanted again to say thanks
for coming up on such short notice.

I mean with what happened
to Bobby and all, I...

I just don't know how we'll get
the place open by July 1st.

Look, unfortunately, it took a lot
longer to get up here than I thought...

and we needed a new clutch
for the van. We...

burned through all of our contingency dough.

I got stuck in Bakersfield
for two days.

I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to leave first thing in the morning.

Well, I mean...

Our new CD is slammin', man.
You gotta hear it.

We sell it at our gig,
7 bucks a copy.

We're doing good. We're averaging
what? 75 copies per show.

Congratulations, Cole.
That's great.

There's just one little ant
stuck in the afterbirth...

we gotta burn a couple of hundred copies...

and with the van breaking down, and
the cost of the posters for the Oregon event...

You need to borrow some money.

Yeah. Look...

dog, uh, I don't want it to seem like
that's the only reason I stopped by.

I mean, if the clutch hadn't getto'ed on me,
we'd be movin' furniture...

and cuttin' back brush
for two days already.

So, how much do you need?

Uh, 7 would be good,
800 would be awesome!

800 dollars?

Peter doesn't have limitless
financial resources, Cole.

The inn isn't even bringing
any money in yet.

I ain't just come up for the money, Darc.

You know, I wanted to kick back with
you, guys. And catch up on old times.

I don't think we should stay.

I had a bad feeling about this place.

Cherise, ink isn't even dry on this
thing and you wanna boogie ?

No way.

A vengeful ghost...

seeks the souls of all who quarter here.

That's the exact same thing
that Mrs. MacDonald said.

Oh, hey.
Hey.

How's the head?

Which one?

Well, you were very brave in town.

So were you.

We always did make
a good team, didn't we?

I just never figured that it would be
for beating up a couple of bubbas.

I've been trying to sort
some things out.

You know, all this stuff
with Pammy.

Her imagination is amazing, but...

sometimes I worry about her.

She has these weird fantasies
that she seems to believe in.

This is a critical time
in her life...

it's got me thinking.

Thinking about what?

Maybe being away at the office all the time
isn't so good for her right now.

You guys should move up here?

I'm not sure yet.

I don't want to give up
everything I've been working for.

With you gone, I have to admit...

the apartment seems very empty.

Life isn't as good as it was.

I think the Hammond brothers
have redeemed themselves.

Maude? Maude?
Stop back there for a minute, that's far enough.

She's gonna go up the house,
make some noise, keep them busy.

We're gonna get the truck.

She isn't exactly been paddling
her straight canoe, Chuck.

What the hell is she gonna do
to keep them busy and...

what is she doing with that
old kitchen knife, again?

Shut up!

Damn.
Let me do this.

Go on, Maude.
Get on in the back.

What are you gonna do, Chuck?
You gonna hotwire it?

Assholes cut the fuel line,
but ain't gonna be good enough.

Shh.

She had no fucking idea what she's doing.

All roads wind uphill.

Death is only a veil that shadows life.

Blood upon the altar.
Wings across the sand.

Now is a time for a cleansing song.

Evil witch, be gone.

What pagan sign are you?

From the Autumn Equinox?

The Spirit of Beltrane.

Stop! I command you!

I am initiated in the ways
of the unforgiven.

Return from once you came!

Be gone, evil spirit!

What the hell's going on in there?

Cherise, open the door!

Shit, man!

Mommy!

Darcy, no!

Fuck!

Why are you doing this?
Tooth.

Pammy's gone.

No!
No, I won't!

Cole, grab the front.

Cole, come on!

Yeah.

Emma, I need you now!

Who the hell's that?

It's the woman from the gas station.
The Hammonds' crazy sister.

That's who's been scaring Pammy.

I don't think so, Darc.
It's something else.

We gotta find her, Peter.
Where could she have gone?

I don't know. She probably
took her bike.

But she went looking for her friend Emma.

She thinks Emma's an expert on witches.

Okay. Where does she live?
I don't know.

We'll go to the neighbors
and we'll ask around. Okay?

Cole, get a hold of the cops.
Tell them to get up here. And...

in the meantime, don't go in
the room or touch the bodies.

Yeah.
We'll be right back.

Come on.

Wait.

You called?

It's horrible. There's a dead woman
out in front of the porch.

There's another one upstairs.

A younger girl.

I saw her spirit leave.

We've got to get the tooth
fairy's music box. Tonight.

There isn't much time left.
She intends to kill everybody.

But she's got a nail gun and an ax.
And she runs faster than anything.

There's no way we'll get
close enough to get it.

You wanna save the children?
I wanna save mommy and Peter.

Then, you gotta come with me.

Come on, we've got to hurry.

Viva!

You're going down for a death nap, honey!

Stop!

There's a hole.

They're okay, keep going.

Son of a bitch.

I told you there was an evil
spirit in that house.

How many people have to die
before you believe me?

Ancient Druids wrote
about children who died

at the same time that they
lost their last tooth.

Legend tells us that they are
cursed to wander the earth...

until their teeth have
been returned to them.

That is how the legend of the
Tooth Fairy was first born.

We need to find my daughter.
Can you help us?

Now, the witch that resides in your house,
has trapped the spirits of many children...

by stealing their teeth
and giving them nothing.

In the old days, the witch hunters
had a sense that...

that fire would cleanse
the evil spirit.

That's why they burned witches at the stake.

And in Celtic lore,
it is said that the soul...

is a devil spiral or a ball
of light times two.

Peter, we need to get out of here
and find Pammy.

You must burn this witch with flames.

But you must do it two times.

The first time, she will extinguish
herself, unharmed.

But the second burning,
will consume her spirit.

Come on, Peter.
By the second burning...

I promise, she will be gone.

Thank you, Mrs. MacDonald,
but we really need to go. Come on.

I'm through messing with Peter, his
uppity bitch and that snot-nosed kid.

What are you gonna do, Chuck?
Well, I'm gonna start by taking a piss...

then I'm gonna go up there and
knock that guy's dick in the dirt.

Shouldn't we just ought
to call cousin Claude?

You hear what I just said?

What are we gonna do, Chuck?

Do you ever shut the fuck up?

The fool ain't got the brains
God gave green apples.

I mean, would you find your own tree?
Can't a man even take a leak by himself?

What are you, Chuck?

What's your dick doing over there, Chuck?

What are we gonna do now, Chuck?

Who are they?
Are they ghosts?

These are some of the children
who were killed by the Tooth Fairy.

Are you a ghost, too?
They chose me to come to you.

It was said there's a noble
spirit would set us free.

When you came here yesterday,
we sensed your spirit.

We're trapped between
heaven and hell.

You're our only hope to set us free.

I'm okay, mom.
Really.

We were so worried.
Where were you?

I was on the far side of the woods.
In the graveyard.

The ghosts of lots of children
are trapped there.

Come on, Pammy.

Darc, let's just hear
what she has to say.

You know, maybe this explanation
isn't quite as simple as...

a couple of rednecks and
their crazy older sister.

Will you come with me, mommy?

It's not that far.

Maybe I could get them
to show themselves.

Peter?

What is it?
Pam, I found your friend.

Emma Inge.

Emma? I need you.

This is crazy.

Emma said she could move little things.

Most of the other children are like that, too.

But, they can't affect matter very much.

Darc, we have two dead
bodies back at the inn.

I think we need to get a hold of the police
and try to explain that to them.

And...

Cole and Star are probably
freaking out by now.

Okay, so come on. Let's go.

It's her.

Emma?

Emma, tell them.
Show them.

They can't see or hear me.
I can't change that.

It's just the way it is.
Who are you talking to, Pammy?

It's her, mom.
She's standing right there.

She's the one that made the candle fall.
I think the wind made it fall.

No, mom.
She's standing right there.

Pam, come on. Now.

Emma, you have to move that candle again.
Show them you're here.

I can't. It's too heavy.

It took all my strength just to
knock it off the headstone.

Ask the others to help.

Help us, everybody.

Throw the candle.
One!

Two!

Three!

Do you believe me now?
How did you do that?

It wasn't me. It was them,
the spirits of those children.

Maybe we should do what
Pam and Emma want us to do.

Yeah.

Come on, man.

Shit. It's the third try.

Can't get through to the Sheriff.

The storm must've knocked
the phone lines out.

Yeah, I really hope they've
found Pammy.

It's getting rough out there.

You writing a song?

Yeah, you know. Shit like this really...

bring stuff up.

I have some really deep feelings.

Just gotta get them down on paper.

All the stuff that used to seem
important just doesn't anymore.

You know, I hate to admit it, but, I'm a...

kind of a selfish guy.

I don't mean to be, it's just...

I sorta use people.

And guys like Peter,
they're an easy mark, I...

I leech off of him and steal...

and you know what, I was gonna...

was gonna smoke this
800 bucks he gave me.

Right now, I really feel
shitty about myself.

People change, Cole.
I mean, you didn't try to use me.

Babe, I was trying to get in your
pants the first time I saw you.

What stopped you?
Just kinda...

hard to get it up with all this
freaky shit going on.

I'm really glad that you told me
something that you're not very proud of.

It takes real courage, Cole.

My mom always told me that people
who could recognize their faults...

are destined to change them.

Underneath, I see
a lot of inner strength.

Cherise said my aura is
muddy and brown.

Maybe it was then, but...

it's not now.

Come on.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

You're right.

Somehow, this all makes sense.

Death and love...

both make life more, more valuable.

Sound like lyrics from a song.

Maybe it will be.

Come here.

Wait. I have to...

I'll be right back.
I just have to, get ready.

Who's that?

Pete?

Shoo. Go!

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, come.

Yeah, come on.

The hell, it's quick.

Yes, that's right!

Don't be so impatient.

Oh shit, man. Now, pull.

Right? You wanna spank me?

Yeah, of course.

Yeah? Come here.
I wanna spank...

Look at you.

Hey, Darcy, you guys go in and get dry.
I'll be right back.

Peter, wait! Emma says
we have to burn the witch.

I know, I think I have some
gas in the garage.

Now go on in and see if Cole
got a hold of the Sheriff.

Be careful.

Okay.

Come on.

Cole, Star, we're back.
We need to talk to you guys.

Peter said the electricity
was funky.

I don't think that's funky
electricity, mom.

Let's get you dried off.

Yeah, well, it'll have to do.

Okay, now, let's get upstairs and get
you out of these wet clothes, okay?

Upstairs, Peter.

Star.

Pammy.

Star?

Sh...shit.

Star? Star?

Star! Star!
It's okay.

Come on.

Come on. It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.
Calm down.

What's fucking going on?

Okay. Okay. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

Shh, I got you. I got you. I got you.

I got you.
It's okay. Shh.

It's okay. Okay, okay, okay.

Why can't I just do it?
Why does it have to be Pam?

Because it's my tooth.
The music box is magical.

Emma said that you have to have
a connection to it to see it.

My tooth is the connection.

I'm scared to death to go back in there.

We have to, mommy.
It's the only way.

Bobby got killed out here.

But if she finds you...

Emma taught me a trick...

to slow her down.

A mirror.

You and Peter have to stay close
and be ready.

Okay. Come on, lets' go.

Come here!

I want my tooth back.

Run, Pammy, run!

Hey, bitch!

Pam, grab the box!

That's one.

Now, mommy! Now!

Go, Darc, go!

Get your teeth, everyone.
Get your teeth.

Are you okay?
Yes, mommy. I'm finally okay.

Are they all gone, Pam?
They're going back where they belong.

Thank you for saving us.
Thank you for saving me.

I'll be waiting.

When you get there,
bring some dress up.

Pammy.

Wait, I forgot something.

My tooth.

I guess that's everything.

I hope so.
Yeah.

I'm sorry for moving out and breaking
the lease. And everything, I just...

After everything that's happened...
Star, it's fine, really.

Everyone feels the same way.

A lot of bad stuff happened here...

Actually, I'm gonna move Darcy
and Pam back to the city...

and I'm going to sell this place.

You're a good man.

Thanks.

I want you to know I appreciate
what you did for me.

You're really kind and treated
me like a person, not a thing

And I'm not really used to be
treated that way, so...

I want you to know how much
that meant to me.

Sure.
Thank you.

Take care of yourself.
Okay.

Okay.

So, you guys ready?
Yup.

Pam will be right down.
Okay.

Peter, I want us to try again.

Yes!
