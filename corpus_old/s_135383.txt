I'm sorry, I had an exam...

Something to drink?

Water please, non-carbonated.

Any history of disease?

No, I've never had
any infectious disease

or any... female problems...

Do you have your tests?
Yes.

Here they are.

Do you snort anything?

No, I don't take drugs.

I don't even smoke.

Are you sure about this?
And you know the price?

Yes, I do. So Iet's not bargain.

I need cash, fast.

I want1 5,000.

Are we staying or leaving?

What's the problem? You OK?

He keeps on staring at us.

So what? He's probably
trying to pick you up.

That's my ride.

Is there anything worth
seeing in Warsaw?

We are.
Isn't that enough for you?

Meet our driver.

So where to?
Let's get a drink in our office,

and then decide.

You packed already? We've got
so much time in the morning.

You always do things at the last
minute, and you're always late.

Oh, chill out. You never know
when is your last minute.

Yeah, yeah.
You always know best.

Wanna dance?

Drink up. You won't have
to drive those dorks around.

You want me to lose my customers?
Where are you guys going?

First, to the Mzury Lakes,
and then we're all going to work.

Where to?
Switzerland.

And what are you going to do there?

Definitely not work in a rice field.

I don't know, babysit,
clean houses, whatever.

Mybe at the pool.
I'm a diving instructor.

I dive, too.

Really? Can you find a wetsuit
to fit your big... frame?

Let's get to know each other better...
But too late since you're leaving.

So come with us...

Come on...

Come on...

Buzzed...

Ola lives next door but
you have to give Agata a ride.

Call me in the morning
and we'll go together.

Will you be up?
I'm not going to lay down at all.

He'll drop you off.
But watch out, he's naughty...

Naughty? I'm into that.
You'll take me home?

Agata, Agata... nice.

Something to drink...

Haven't had enough?
Thank God you're alive.

Looks like the car is totalled.

You guys always come out clean.

And the girl's in a coma.
Look what you've done to her.

What's her name?
She doesn't have any lD on her.

Agata...

I have to call her family.
It doesn't look good.

I fucked up. Come and get me.

Where am l?

Are you kidding me?
Where are you?

You were wasted.

You have no idea how much I paid
that butcher in the hospital

for the documents
before the pigs came.

Any idea where you crashed?

They said it was in the forest
around here. So where are you?

Go to the grocery store.
Grocery? What grocery?

Got it.

You alone?

We're not gonna talk through
the window. Where are you?

AII right...

Turn around.

They'll figure out
how you drove off the road.

Stupid joke, huh?

Will they go for it?

Otherwise I'm screwed
with insurance.

Someone's been snoopin' around.

Forget it. The girl will come out
of this. Just stay away.

I'm not going to leave her there.

Forget it!

You're gonna get us in trouble.

Nice view. I've never been here.

What would you like to drink?

Tomato juice with ice, please.

You didn't look so hot last night.
How do you feel?

So did you pack?
Coming with us?

Do you know where Agata lives?

She's in the hospital.

I crashed the car.

She's dying.

Oh, Mrta. Come in.

How will you pack all this stuff?

We need to speak. Where is
Agata? I have no patience for her.

I want to talk to you
before Agata comes in.

You can take this down.
And leave this tank for me.

Please, take a seat.

Sir, please, take a seat.

Listen...

I know I shouldn't stick my nose in,
but I had a dream.

I always worry when Agata
goes on your diving trips.

I dreamt that you were
all swimming

and she was sitting
on the bottom of the lake.

Enough already!
It was horrible,

because she looked like...

Iike she was dead.

I beg you, talk to her.
She shouldn't dive this time.

Do you have any sedatives,
ma'am?

Of course, how many do you need?

A lot.

Can I ask you for a glass of water?

Yes, of course.

Just please...

Please...

Don't... don't panic...

Did you sober up?

You're not allowed in here.
Stop or I'll call security.

I have to talk to her.
You can't.

You can't speak to her...
because she's dead.

Who was that?

You're escaping, my boy.
And people die here...

The paramedic found this
in your crashed car.

Olka!

She was totally beaten up
and they had to remove her kidney,

This one here came from Romania
with no lD on her.

So she went through
a difficult surgery.

But she died from something else:
blood transfusion.

They gave her the wrong
type of blood.

It's not written here.
Yes,

but I read people's guts
like a book.

It's a rare case.

Her whole body was infected.
She didn't have a chance.

Someone gave her
the wrong type of blood.

Mybe the nurse, or maybe
they misidentified her type?

What's the difference,
she's gone.

I want to see her.

This Romanian has been waiting
for months to be burned.

But they took yours instead.

What you wanna see, ashes?

What'll you tell him? "ls the girl
weighing on your conscience?"

What conscience?

You want to let him off the hook?

She's dead and it's not my fault.
Let's leave that to the police.

Do I know you?

Andrzej Kozlowski?

ID or a badge, please.

Though it doesn't really matter,
you can forge anything.

Let's wait with the police stuff...

Nice pad.

An art expert.

So you're from... the lRS?

Know what?
Go back to the office,

file a report and then
we'll chat about art.

A surgeon.

Transplantology intern
in Switzerland.

Gynecologist by trade.

Doing well?

Relax, I'm a taxi driver.

I was driving a girl
around town last night.

She got a bit drunk, had a bit of fun
and now she's a bit pregnant?

So, when she's more pregnant
then come back to me.

No! Not her.
Another one.

She ended up in your hospital
without a kidney.

During your shift.

You know what?

Excuse me.

In the meantime you can have
a drink, unless you're driving again.

So? You bought that bullshit?

An international gang kidnaps
Polish students

and chops them up?

Why Polish?
Cause they're healthy?

What for? Why?

6,000 people die
a year in accidents.

What's the point of kidnapping?

Only some people
are suitable to be donors.

The others are just pork chops.

You can't just randomly
kidnapp people.

A donor has to have the right blood
type and at least five antibodies.

You can't just go to a club and cut
out a kidney of any girl.

That's ridiculous!

She died because you transferred
the wrong type of blood.

Didn't you even check her type?

I did test the blood,
but yours not hers.

You were D.U.I.
Not too shabby for a taxi driver.

I won't cause you
any problems.

I'll just hide this file away
as a... souvenir.

So... get lost.

Anyway, you have guests.

28 years old, single, right?

Nice pad, huh?

You're quite a case.

Drug dealer, smuggler,
2 years in jail -

accused of murder but let out
on the grounds of lack of evidence.

So you came to the gynecologist
because your sister is pregnant?

My friend had an accident,
she had an operation

and somewhere along the way
her kidney disappeared.

Sure. The Yugoslav Gang catches
people and cuts out their kidneys

And the doctor
is covering it all up.

Mybe.

What do you make of it?

Looks like the girl is injured
so you came to the doctor

with an offer: either a few bucks
or you'll have problems.

And that is called

"blackmail".

Excuse me. Could you step out?

Stay away from the doctor, OK?

Is he your buddy?

Mlecki?

You're in deep shit.

And don't slam the door.

We've gotta stay here.
Let's look for a hotel.

My shirt.

It was their last room.

I'm going back to Warsaw.
I'll come get you tomorrow.

You're behind this?

You think I'll stay over
with someone like you?

You'll come running
once you freeze.

The door was open.
I'm out of here.

What are you looking for?

Until he has proof I was drunk
he'll threaten with the Police.

Weren't you? If they catch us
we'll... YOU'LL go to jail.

Come in with me. If they ask
you'll just say the door was open.

Just don't touch anything.

I've checked. It doesn't work.

This one works!

I was already framed
for a murder once.

So now let's wait for the doctor.

Are you sure about this?
You know the prices?

Yes, I know the rates.

So Iet's not bargain.

I need cash, fast.

How much?

For my kidney...

I want 1 5,000.

It's called the "rape drug".

I could do anything with you
and you wouldn't remember a thing.

One of your friends
drugged me with it.

Mybe the Swiss guys?

How well do you know
your friends?

And OIa? She wanted to sell
her kidney for o1 5,000.

Maybe she had some issues?
She's your friend, right?

OIa was wild.

But maybe it wasn't
her kidney she wanted to sell.

Then whose? Yours?

Think. Which one of them
could have tried to do me in?

For now don't tell them
about OIa, ok?

Hi.

Are you going to the bar?

Two beers for me!

A chocolate bar!

Paulina, upstairs as usual.

The power's out.

Good morning.

Who's got cash?
Probably no one.

Stand on the corner
and make a few bucks.

Two handles, please.

and two boxes
of condoms.

That'll last you five years.
They're rubbers not rubber bands.

Quiet. Settle down.

Give me a first aid kit!

Teletubbies say bye, bye...

I'll wait for Ola. Anyone know
where she is? Mrta?

Did you call her?

When are we going to tell'em?
What can we tell them?

You know them better.
Ola's dead, they'll get that.

Unless they're immortal.

I had an accident. I just want
to know who laced my drink.

Mybe those Swiss guys
Agata brought along?

Agata? Have you known her long?

Forever. She's my best friend.
And that fake blond guy?

Did you see how much
he snorted? Mybe him?

Pawel has two joys in life:
picking up girls and snorting coke.

Don't you get it? Your "friend"
is going downhill.

He's got debts.
Mybe he's being blackmailed?

Or you really were drunk and
you're looking for someone to blame.

And the doctor?

Mybe he felt bad
and couldn't take it any more.

So, how do you feel?

Mybe I should go to emergency
to get some shots?

Shit, power's out again!

Take the candle. Let's go.

The pump!

Dammit!

There's someone here.

Holy shit!

I tried to catch the bastard
but he punched me.

Do you always have to
think of yourself?

Who am I supposed to think of?
Who's going to think of me, you?

You were going to tell us
about Ola. Where is she?

What should I know about
a chick I've never even laid?

What a prick.
And I thought you were cool.

Just cause we hang out doesn't
mean we're "friends" yet.

Ever wondered why you've
never been to my place?

Never mind.
It's not about me.

Listen, it's like this.
For Ola to be in Warsaw

she has her dad working two shifts,

her mom sold her insurance policy

and Ola probably flips
burgers at night.

Jesus, I'm gonna start balling
in a sec.

Why is it that each of us
has been hit or injured?

Well, not everyone. You and Mrta
are still in one piece.

Is someone hunting us down?

Seems like someone here
knows, what's going on.

Why did Ola want
to sell her kidney?

Dude, are you kidding?

We're not gonna believe that
a law student had no choice

but to chop herself up
to pay off debts.

I don't have anything
to do with this.

That's it. I have to go.
There is a girl waiting.

So: "love you,
arrive derci, bye bye"

See ya!

What's going on?

I wanted to write an article
about something important.

Issues that are kept secret.

But sales count. They want stuff
about pedophiles, prostitutes.

Not about some poor family
on the block.

So I found it.

Organ trade?
Yes.

It happens everywhere:
in Russia, China, Romania,

but in Poland it's hush-hush.
I wanted to check it out.

Ola wanted to help.

For money?
Please!

I promised her a few bucks
for an ad.

She met with some guy,
set a price.

Then she was supposed
to tell him she's pregnant

and is cutting off the deal.

But he didn't back off.

Ola took drugs, so she couldn't
show her own blood tests.

So whose results were they?

I don't know.

Really.

She just found out how they
do it and for how much.

That's it.

Can you... show me the video?

I can't do it.

I know my kidney is the last resort
for someone out there

but I can't risk it.

I want kids someday.

Can I have my tests back?

Wanna smoke up?

Roll one.

How long have
we known each other?

About ten years.

You pulled me out of prison.

Well...

it cost a bit.

And now I messed up your car.

Are you softening up on me? I helped
you out, that's what friends are for.

Whose place is this?
Remember the girl from the party?

This is her place?

How much is she selling it for?

She's not.

Everything's for sale, you just
have to know for how much.

I'll show you something.

Do you know her?

No,
but I'd love to get to know her.

Let's go for a ride.

It was supposed to be
a regular deal. She wanted to sell.

And the Swiss guy
wanted to buy.

She showed the blood tests, which,
as it turned out, were not hers.

The car crash was your idea

as a cover-up
for the operation?

They drugged me
and you crashed the car.

And they hospitalized
the girl to remove her kidney?

Why are you so sensitive
all of the sudden, man?

Did you forget how many
people are after your ass?

You're in this just
as much as the rest of us.

Why did the doctor kill himself?

Did he?

I'm scared for the first time.

The Swiss guy sent the two
you took around the clubs.

The are pros.
Scared of nothing.

What are they looking for?

That chick... they were going abroad
to work and had blood tests.

One had a very rare
blood type, AB Rh-,

but the Swiss
didn't know which one.

They're safe for now.

Noone's gonna let themselves be tested
in the middle of the street.

Pawel?

What a weird smell.

So sweet. Is it a pipe?

It's a joint, kid.

I'm 16 and I'm not a kid.

You're right.

I smoke cigarettes too,
but my dad doesn't know yet.

Better don't let him know.

Let me have a drag.

I don't like filterless.

Where are mom and dad?

They're paying for the room.

You have a long history.

What are they doing?

Nothing.

What do we do?
What should we get them on?

Ever shot at someone?

Get out, smile politely,

return the l.D.

and wish them well.

The guy is wanted.

He killed someone.

What do we do?

They probably added
something new to your resume.

He's a bodyguard not my dad.
He never leaves my side.

You know what?

It'd be easy to lose him here.

Go to the pool, through
the girl's bathroom into the yard

and then go wherever you want.

He's not going to go
into the girl's bathroom, is he?

How do you know that way out?

I come here every year
and score girls like you.

You're going to want
to break away too, aren't you?

That's why I came here.

You know what I'm talking about?

F-U-C-K-l-N-G.

Fucking.

Let me have another drag.

But so that he doesn't see.

Why did he have to die?

We're exploring the mysterious
death of 22 year old Kamil.

The 2nd autopsy showed
a missing kidney.

Kamil's mother

claims that her son died
at the hands of organ dealers.

The prosecutors are dropping
the case

considering evidence that Kamil
died in a car accident.

Pawel?!

I'm visiting hotel suites.
Later. See ya.

And where are the 'rents?

They're on the other side
of the lake with their friends.

My dad's going to be drunk,
and mom's going to be pissed off.

But that's tomorrow.

Any ideas?

That's what I thought.

If you try,
I might surprise you.

Then this is for you.

Take a bath.
I'll mix some drinks.

You don't like the scent
of a real man?

Wanna get in?

I have a surprise for you.
You'll enjoy it.

Give me the keys.
I left mine in the room.

Thanks.

I told you you'd go back
to the slammer.

You don't believe it?

That in Poland they cut out kidneys
for a mere 100 thousand dollars?

I'll be back as soon as possible.
The boys should be here any minute.

Bye.

Don't move.
Easy, I'm Artur.

Who cares!

Sit down!

I said sit down!

What are you doing here?

We've met. Through Szymon.

What are you doing in my house?
I'll explain

just put the pitchfork down.
I work with Szymon.

Where?
Not that shithole he's at now.

We used to smuggle stuff.
He's worried about you.

Then why didn't he come himself?
Call and ask him.

He asked me to come.
You broke in here.

The door was open so I thought
I'd wait inside. Can I get up?

No!

I'm calling the police!

Szymon won't be happy.
What do I care?

You've got problems too.
Sit and don't move.

Remember the Swiss guys?

They're back.

And they're at the lake.

How do you know?
Let's talk

before you call the police.
One more move...

Scared? I am, too.

Give me more light.

Mrta! Relax.

It's me, Rafal.
Remember?

Show me your face.
I'm an Europol police officer.

Show me your face!

Turn around!

I'm Rafal Morr.
Trust me.

Easy, I know what it is.

Excuse me, can you smoke here?

So who were they?

Police from Europol,
with real l.D.'s.

But we'll never know
who they worked for.

I was just going to wake you up.
Come on.

The nurse?

Nope. One of the best surgeons
in the country

who had her license
revoked two years ago.

Are you starting a healthy life
with a morning jog?

You partied while I was attacked,
robbed and almost raped.

I am not telling you anything.

You guys wouldn't be able
to sympathize

with a person with shit luck.

Who am I talking to, anyway.

I'm afraid of my own shadow.
I don't fly because of terrorists,

I don't go to clubs cause
the security will beat me up.

I can't get laid because of AlDS.
That underaged girl did this to you?

What a fucked up world we live in.

Drive.

I'll take down your report
and then...

go on your way.
