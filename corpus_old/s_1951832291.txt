Late last night and the night before

Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door

I want to go out
but I don't know if I can

because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

Bobbi.

Late last and the night before

Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door.

I want to go out but
I don't know if I can

because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

Hilly, stop it!

I want to go out but I don't know if I can

because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

Mom make him stop!.
You are afraid.

No.

All right, Hilly, stop torturing your brother.
and get ready for school. - But Mom!

Hey Hilly, don't argue with your mom.

I want you to come straight home after
school today. OK? You've got chores.

Yeah, says you're only a kid once.

Yeah, gramps doesn't pay the bills around here.

I do, and as long as I do, you're gonna
do what I tell you, right?

Yes, sir... oopss

Damn it, Hilly!
Sorry....

Wait up Hilly!.

...and don't slam the... door...

Hilly without accidents is as
McDonalds without hamburgers.
-Yeahh...

You were a little hard on him.

Well, somebody's got be tough on him.

Your dad spoils him rotten.

Well, those boys are his whole life.

Thirty new tricks.

Hours of fun for the young presti...

prestit-gita-tor?

Ha, ha... that's magician in plain english.

You're ok?

It's cool!

Except...

Except for what?

Well, Dad says there's no such
thing as magic.

Dads forget things being dads.

That's what happens to grown-ups.

But your're a grown-up...
Nooo, I'm an old man.

Kids and old people, we know that magic's real,

no matter what anybody says.

There's even a place... that's magic.

A place?

Yes, old Bobbi Anderson farm.

In my day, we called it "Big Injun Woods".

But it's called "Burning Woods" now.

But no matter what it's called,
there's magic there.

The Injuns believed it and so do I.

You mean, they're haunted?
Yup... magic spirits.

You have to your witts when you go there...

And Hilly... never, never go there alone.

Ok, David, let's use your thumb, shall we?
There you go...

All right, there.

Good... Perfect!

You see? That's how we fingerprint our suspects.

See that? Everybody?
Over here... come on, over here...

This.... this is where we have our cells.

And we put all the people who break
the law in here.

Ok, and then down here, this is the
dispatcher's station...

where Mrs. Paulson answers all the
important police calls.

Don't you Mrs. Paulson?

Yes I do!

Ok, come on in here, let's go see the school room.

This is the best part. Come on.

You see, when I was a little girl,
my parents used to travel a lot.

Every time they went to a new country
they would bring me another doll.

So, I have dolls from Africa, and East Asia,
and from all over the world.

Dolls were your hobby?

Oh, yes! They are my hobby.

My friends know that I like them so
every time they travel they bring me one.

Oh, no, Donna! We do not break anything, do we?.

Oh, that's all right, well, Jojo's never
been broken.

Go ahead, pull up.

My name is Jojo what's yours?

They are bad! I'm scared!
David, it's ok, sweetheart.

Come on children.

Tell you what... why don't you come back


some other time and we'll see them together?
ok? All alone, just you and me? all right?

Bye, Davey.
Bye

Now, one of you scared that little boy...

Come on... Which one of you scared
that little boy?

Haven Post office. Joe Paulson.

Mmm, hi Joe, it's me.
Hi, hon.

I'll be right home at 6 o'clock.

because I'm making that chicken
Kiev that those ruskies eat...

it scorch raw butter when you stick
your fork in it.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry... I think
I'm gonna have to work late tonight.

Oh, Joe, come on... not again!

You know that new post mistress
it's a real tirant.

Oh, yeah, honey... she's much harder

on me than old Charlie Ester, but for sure.

Yeah, would you tell her for me that Becka Paulson

likes her husband home for dinner.

Yeah, honey I will... I gotta go now...
Bye..

That woman's gonna be the death to him.

Are you ready?
Am I ready? Is that your question?

Am I ready? It's like the sign says,
neither the snow nor the rain...


can stop these courier.
From swift completion...

... of their appointed route.

To be buried in buffalo skins...

rather than in coffins...

What are you looking at?



ok, let's go!... come on!

All right, one more time... ready?
Ready?

Go get it!

What's the matter?
Don't you see where it went?

I'm ok, l'm ok.

What, what, what?
What's the matter with you?

What? It's just a can.

Weird.

What's the matter with you?

ok! ok! we go home.

Come on!

I'd like you to meet a new friend
of ours from Maine...

James Gardener.

Hi, I'm Jim, and I am an alcoholic.

Hi Jim.

I haven't had a drink in about a year now...

not that I don't want one all the time.

Hell I don't...

The thing with me and booze is that
basically, I have a bad containment system.

You know, it's like there's this
technician in here... somewhere

that should've been fired like a long time ago.

And when I drink I turn into this stranger...

who does the stupidest crazy things.

A monster.

And you know, my friend, Bobbi, she always says:

Knowing is one thing, but doing something
about it is... another... well,

Anyway, the problem is, I've got this poem
that I have to read in public.

It's probably the last chance to see if I can
hack it on the circuit as a poet.



Well, I'm scare to death I'm gonna
need to drink to do it.

 I'm scare to death.

I appreciate you bringing this to me, Butch, but...

you could have called it in or fax it to me...

All part of the service, Ruthie.

Thank you.

Um... any plans on coming up
to Derry sometime.

No, not in a near future.
Why?

No reason... just wondering.

Ladies...

Bye, Butch.
Bye...

What?

I think he's sweet on you.

Don't be ridiculous.

I'll be back in about an hour, boys.
Anything new?

All quiet on this front, captain.
When're you gonna ask that Merril woman
out on a date?.

Don't you guys have something better to do than
worry about my private life jingles?

Like checking all the diners in northern Maine

for health violations or something?

You can bark all you want to,
but just because she was your partner's wife

and a damned fine constable, besides,

there's no reason not to speak your heart.

Let it be, fellas, let it be...

Ben's right, time's going by...

and neither of you is getting any younger...

Becka...

You get away from that window,
and go back to work, please?

Hilly?

Go to sleep kiddo.
What abou you?

I'm reading about Harry Houdini.

Who's that?
Greatest magician in history.

I'm gonna be just like him some day.
Go to sleep, kid.

The hot water here is really shut.

I thought I get us a new one while you're gone.

No, let's just see if we keep the old one going
for a few weeks...

I'll buy us a new one when I get back.
Okay...

172 
Oh, Pete and I found a great cash of 
firewood today.

Mm-mm ... Haven't started the novel, uh?



there's no reason to rub it in.

So, that sexy young school merm

and the buffalo hunter haven't got together yet?

I hate you.

You ok?

Hey, never better, Bobbi.

Never better.

It's just a storm, buddy.
It's just a storm, go back to sleep.

Mmm... here's some nice mashed
for those old teeth.

Todd, it's not my imagination, right?

The vision in his right eye does seem to be returning. 

Let's take a closer look, shall we?

Sorry, he's never like this.

Peter!.
Dr. Etheridge, come quick!

I'm afraid you will have to excuse me.

Hey, hey... what's...? Pete!

Hey lady... why don't you get your dog out of here?

Our last poet is no stranger to

those of you who remember "Raging Angel".

The book that some critics claimed...

gave authority to voice to the angst
of the last decade.

I trust he will provide us with a
memorable finish reading us his latest work.

Friends of new poetry,
I give you James Eric Gardener.

Gardener.

Good evening.

I was going to try to leave up to my reputation...

and read something new and angry tonight.

But instead I think I'll be a little umpredictable

and read something from my first book.

<i > It's a love poem called: One more mile </i>.

It's for Bobbi Anderson.

Only for you.

I was raised to believe God was love...

But how loving can God be

when he makes man and woman
smart enough...

to land on the moon...

but stupid enough to have to learn
that there's no such thing as forever?

Only have to learn it over and over again.

One more mile. Just one more mile.

Then one day I dreamed I found you...

Illusion made substance,
in a dream realer than any....

...Your eyes looked up at me
and saw the me...

... After all these doubts and all these fears...

after all these questions without answers.

And dreams without substance.

I journeyed home
One more mile...

Just one last mile.

...and there you were.

Thank you, thank you... thank you very much.

Well, are you sure you're ringing the right room?

He is with the New England poetry caravan...

I have been ringing Ma'am.
Would you like to leave a message?

Uh, yeah... just tell him...
No, never mind. Just, no, thanks...

I'll just uh... try later.

Well, he'd see it alright.

He said: Bobbi... Cadillacs don't receed...

we gotta find out where he's been and
what he's gotten into.

Oh, buddy, I know where you've been.
I'll take a better look.

Peter, come here.

Ok, listen. I don't want you going
with me...

... cause I don't want you freaking out, alright?

So just go on back to the house. Go on!
Good boy!

What the hell are you?

My folks will kill me if they found out we were here.

Who's gonna tell'em?

Gramps says this is where the Indians
used to pray to the gods.

Give me a break!
Really!

They believed this was a place of magic,

in between the spirit world and the real.

Agghh... grose!

Whaaa... what do you think killed it?

probably ate some poisoned bait.

Yeah, maybe it was sacrificed to the gods.

What?

Don't you hear it?

Gramp's was right.

Hilly....
Run, Barney!

What are you kids doing here?

You shouldn't be alone in the woods.

Let's go call your dad.
He can pick you up.

A drink, sir?

Uhh.. tonic water, please.

I... think your poem was wonderful
tonight, Mr Gardener.

Thank you very much, son.

Hey, my friends call me Jim.

Thanks.
Everything alright, Gardener?

Ah, Patricia, I didn't know you cared.

Tonic water.
I'm doubious.

Yes, you always have, but what you
really are, though, Patty is a...

264 
little ticked off, aren't you?
I mean, I got the biggest hand of the day.

I pay you to read new poetry.

Not old stuff.

When's the last poem you wrote
that got published?

When's the last poem you wrote that
was any good?

You may fool them... you don't fool me.

You are nothing but a drunk, Gardener.

Always were... always will be.

Why don't we add some vodka to that?

Whatever you say, Mr. Gardener

I say... uh, second thoughts... hold the tonic.

Hi, Pearl how are you?

Hi sheriff! What can I do for you?

Oh, well, just my usual wash and fluff.

Don't listen to a word she says, Pearl.

You gotta doll her all up.

She's got a big date and I do mean...
Do you mind...please?

Big!!
Becka stop it!

She's going to the movies with Butch.

Tell the world why don't you?

You have to wear one of those kind of
outfits like Michelle Pfeiffer wears.

Just the regular, Pearl, please?

Oh.. Pearl, and you know what? Can you show her
some of that new polish and lipstick that you got?

Yes, yes!

Final Passion...

No... no..., thank you very much.
That's where I draw the line, girls.

Ruth's right.

We don't want our sheriff downtown
looking like a floozy.

Besides, I've just sold the last
set to the post mistress.

Good! I'm glad to hear that!

Ladies...
Hi, Nancy.

Well, then... bye bye everyone.
Bye, Nancy.

That was close....
Yeah, yeah...

Where have you been?
Bobbi Anderson's woods, that's where.

Not "Burning Wood"?
Yeah.

After all that we told you about
not going in there?

You were right, gramps, the woods are magic.

Upstairs young man.

Bad magic.
Not another word!

Well... Ev Hillman, this looks like your fault.

Boys are always jumping around
I was like them when I was his age!

If you're gonna live under my roof,
would you please live by my rules?

Ev...

00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:41,946
I'm sorry....

Are you ok?

I got a hell of a headache...

I think something bit me up there...

you know, when I was picking up Hilly...

Well, there's a lot of flu,
Do you want me to call Doc Ward?

No... he'll just tell me to drink a lot of water...

and get plenty of rest. I'll be okay.

What's his name again?
No, no... don't tell me, don't tell me

It's that sound you make when you gargle.

That's it, isn't it? Arglebargle?

Well... Arberg, actually.
No, Arglebargle.

It sounds so much better, don't you think?

Mr. Arglebargle... hello.

Maybe you'd better call it a night..
Yess, sir, maybe... 

maybe you're right. Maybe I should
just go home...

get a good night sleep and live
to write another day.
 
To fight...

...another day.

God, the american people had finally got this true
noble business into perspective...

so, we can go ahead with the new plant.

26 deads... it's horrible...

but then, last month a plain crash killed a 195...

and you don't see the government shutting
down all the air lines, do you?

At Chernobyl they killed kids, did you know that?

uh... 9 year-olds... the ones "in utero".

Isn't that right, Mr. Kilowatt?

I will fix you...
Oh, Patricia!

Really? Oh, I've been waiting to be
fixed by you for years!

Shall we maybe go upstairs, or just give
everybody a treat and do it right here on the rock, uh?

I'm going to see to it that you
never work again, you...

Drunkard, contemptious, worthless...

Hey, you!

Caramba!! You... stupid ass!
Andale, andale, andale!!

Stop! Somebody help me!

Help you... help you... Is that all you can say,
Mr. Power Man?... Mr. Kilowatt?

You nuking SOB...

Hey... you gotta bag out of here,
ladies called the cops.

Yeah... oh God, I shouldn't have done that.

What? Hit him?

Nooo... Open the umbrella in the house
bad luck!

Good-bye, my friend.
Good-bye, Sir.

If... If you remember nothing else in this world...

remember this...

...God hates a coward.

Oh... What have I...?

What did I do this time?

Bobbi!

<i> Hey, thanks for the ride </i>

Jack Kimball, my name. 

Hi, Jack.

I'm a salesman. Mr. Suck-it-up.

Spare vacuum cleaner parts?

Selling people the American dream, right?

So, what's your name, what's your game, friend?

Jim Gardener's the name, poetry's the game. 

I've never met a poet before.

So, where if I might ask are you
headed, Mr. Poet?

The place for when you have to go there they

have to take you in... home.

Oh... that's nice, that's very nice.

There's a thermus and sack of
drunken doughnuts

in the back if you're hungry.

Thanks.

Let's see if I can get some driving music.

ahhh... damn!

What the hell was that?
That was me...

Do you see this?

Yeah, you were in a fight?

Yeah... with a giant pine.

Well, how did that happen?

It was trying to impress this pretty

young thing on the slopes when I was 17.

When I woke up,

they had filled my head with a steel plate.

They told me I'd get headaches from time to time.

Headaches? My God! You are lucky to be alive.

Yeah, that's what they said.
What they didn't say...

...was that every now and then

I was gonna pick up a microwave issue
or a radio transmission.

Oh, man! That is really something.

Your are the first guy I've met
that can make a trick like that.

Some trick.

Hilly, wake up!.
There is a monster in my closet!

Some monster...

Can I sleep in your bed tonight?
Sure.

Back we go, all warm and safe and toasty.

I saw it... the Tommyknocker...

It's only a nursery rhyme, Davey.

Back when I was little, my friends
used to tease about them too.

Good night.

No nuts?

You look real nice.

Thanks. So do you.
Thanks

I liked the movie.
Yeah, me too.

Can I ask you something, Ruthie?

I will answer if I can.

After Ralph died, why did you stay in Haven?

Well... to start with... I don't like cities so much...

and then... after a while the land cast a spell,
kinda gets to you.

So, let me ask you a question.

Name it.

How come you never got married?

Me? What woman would marry
a big log like me?

Lot of women.

Yeah, as a matter of fact...

What?

Uh... nothing... I was thinking I have
to get up early. Let's go, ok?

Sure.

Joe!!!
Joseph Paulson you come back here this instant!

You oughtta be ashamed, don't you forget something?

No, what...? I'm sorry honey.

You better be!

Your sandwiches...

...for you and the boys... for your fishing trip.

Oh...really... this is great. Thanks a lot, honey.

Bye, I'll see you tonight ok?

She bought the fishing story?

Hook, line and sinker.

Good, then hop on in and let's see
what we can catch.

Hop on in and let's see what we can catch
hahahahaha...

The magic guillotine, behold its sharpness.

Observe.

I need a volunteer from the audience.

You, Barney Applegate.
Me?

I hope you know what you're doing...

Now, just put your finger in here.

Thank you... thanks.

Ok, now I need a volunteer for my next trick.

Mr. Allison.

Me? I don't think so.

Come on Mr. A, be a sport.

Okay, I'll do it.... Just make it fast, Hilly.

And now... the white and black rabbit trick!

First, it's white...

Now...please take off the top, sir.

I'm sorry, Mr. Allison.
Just give me another chance...

I can do the multiplying queen trick.

Thanks for the ride.

Pete... Petey!

How you doing? How are you?
Come here!

You're good.

Where's Bobbi? okay, okay!
Where is she?

Bob! Bobbi?

God... I'm so glad you're back!

Wait to see it...

It should've been you, Gard... It should've been you
who found it.

Found what?

I think that it was for you.

What? What was?

Well... you will understand it when you see it.

And you feel it...
Hey...hey...

What do you want?

Euphoria.

A miracle.

At first I just thought it was a car, you know...

I mean, like that time we found that Hudson...

I mean, I could have walked past this thing three times 
a day for 40 years and never stumble over it!!

Are you alright?
Yeah... but...

Please slow... down a little bit.

I... yeah...okay, yes, I'm rambling, I know.

I haven't slept and I guess I need
some food too, but I'm telling you, Gard,

I just... it makes me feel different and
I... have all this energy... and...

and...I've got ideas and... well...

and you're telling me you think this thing
in the ground is making you feel this way.

It has affected Pete, too... I mean, yeah, yeah

His eye is better, the catarat is... is... 
disappearing...

Please, honey.

Tell me what's going on here?

Well... no, I have to show you.

Just wait till you see it, Gard! 
you are not going to believe it!

Oh!... You okay?

Here it is...

It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen!

It's really something, isn't it?

What the hell is this?

I don't know... hahaha...

Oh... I wanna show you something else...

Watch this!

Touch it.

What?

Touch it.

Oh, come on, it's not gonna bite you!

Bobbi...
What's the matter?

Gard... Gard...!

Oh, God!
Oh... Gard!

I'm bleeding. It stopped, I think ...

Oh... Gard... you scared me to death...

I'm okay...

What happened? What was it?

I don't know, you saw it... I touched that thing
and I felt like my head was gonna explode...

It's like the DTs.

I just can't believe that that thing
could do this to you.

Yeah...well... maybe it didn't.

I haven't been too good for the last
couple of days, you know...

No... I... I don't know.

Well, you know, I was... I was away over there
and I got... I got this really bad feeling

that you were in trouble and I...

Is that why you came back early?

My hero.

Some hero!

I fell off the wagon, Bobbi.

What?

Yeah... sorry...

Sorry? just... like that?

Well...after everything we've been through
and everything we worked for...

You're sorry?

I don't know what happened...
I had this success thing and...

you weren't there to share it with me...

and I just haven't...

Come on, say something.

You go to hell!

Hey, Tweetie... Here you are...

Okay if I come in?

Didn't go so good at school today, uh?

They all laughed...
So?

They laughed at Columbus, too.

Who cares what they think?
I do!

I practiced so hard!
I wanted it to be perfect!

Of course, you do, kiddo!

You've just got... cat whiskers for nerves...

But all artists and smart guys do.

but the trick is... to get back up on the horse

and show'em who's boss!

You mean, like... you know, like...
starting again?

Yeah... That's what makes the difference
between winners and losers.

Try again!

Bobbi, could you just listen to me
for a minute?

I couldn't help it.

That's a lie...

...I didn't even try!

I just drank.

I got all this applause at this... old, old poem!

I mean, let's be real here!

I haven't written anything worth
crap in years!

Years!

I am a fraud, Bobbi...

maybe I always have been...

I know I don't deserve your
forgiveness, but I'm sorry...

You are the only one whose love
still matters to me, you know...

I don't know what I'd do if
you stopped loving me, Bobbi.

Don't you know by now that I will
always love ya.

Yeah... I get it.

Hilly...? Hilly?
Who are you talking to?

So I take those things and it'll work?

<i > Hi, I'm Chaz Steward, and welcome
again to He-Devil...

where our three lovely ladies in just
a moment are gonna fight

for a night of breath taking romance...

...with our one hunk of a stud
over here, Larry.

Here, here... Hey! Look!
Carefully... Watch out!

You almost you made me hit my car!
What?

No no no, I gotta go, I gotta go!

Becka is expecting me, I gotta go...

Oh, c'mon, Joey, it's our tender hour...

I gotta go, I gotta go...
Go on then... Run home to wifey...

Come on!.

There is something, in the woods.

Maybe it's the big wolf!

No, really, there is something!

It's just an "aminal", Joe!
It's an "aminal"!

It's just an "aminal"!

Let us out of here!

Go!

I want you to go home now, Joe.

Becka... honey... um, do I have any
clean shirts that's ironed?

Why didn't you wake me up
when you came home last night?

Well... thought it was very late and..

And it was very late
and you were sleeping...

...and I didn't wanna wake you up.
Yeah, but you know... 

you should have called me or something,
I was awfully worried!

Honey, I'm in the middle of the woods,
how am I gonna phone you?

Well..., you know, I cooked your
favorite meal last night
Oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

And I got on that nightgown that 
you really like a lot and I...

Oh, I'm sorry.

Where is the fish?
What fish?

You know, the fish.
The fish... honey, I'm a lousy fisherman,
and the fishing was lousy.

And do I have ironed shirts?
You were supposed to do'em yesterday.

Yeah... I put them right in the drawer.
Honey, they are not in the drawer.

Come on, all I'm asking is that you
give me one shirt that's ironed.

Gramps.

What is it kiddo? what's wrong?

I need your help, I need some batteries.

Batteries?
Yeah, and other stuff too.

I've got a list.
What's this all about?

I've come up with a new trick, I can
do it on my birthday party on Saturday.

A new one, uh? Is it a good trick?

Not good...great!

The best trick anyone's ever seen.

It'll make'em gasp and scream and yell.

A trick that'll be remembered forever!

Heyyy Petey!.
About time!

You've been up long?

Hours!
Really?

Breakfast is almost ready.

You need to shave.

Yeah, well... I would trade my soul
in for a long hot shower and the plus'

You would?
Mm-mm

Well... hand it over then...
Wait a minute... 

you didn't call a plumber, did you?
We talked about this.

I didn't call a plumber, I did it myself
while you were gone.

Hey, Pete... Miss Home Improvement, uh?

Oh, ye of little faith!

What?

What the hell...?

What's the trick, Bobbi?

Uh.. It... It... there is no trick...

It all just... uh, kinda came to me.

I heard a voice telling me...

that I could do something about
the hot water here.

And next thing I knew it was done.

Wait a minute... Let me get this straight...

You're telling me that... that thing
out there is talking to you?
Mm-mm

yeah... as I uncover it, it's sending out
some kind of transmission.

And turned you into an Einstein, uh?

Well, no, not Einstein exactly...

'cause Einstein knew things
and I don't know anything.

I just...

I mean, I had no idea how I got
the hot water heater to work.

I just knew as I was doing it

and everything seemed clear as a bell.

Look, I don't know what that thing is...

I just know that we have to dig it up.

Gard, there's something miraculous about it.

Let's experience it together.

It really oughtta patent it!

Heeey.. What...what is this?

My invention.

Wooww... What does it do?

Sorts the first class mail... Watch this!
Come on! Are you...?

Look at this little flag! I love it!

Woooww... you gotta be kidding me!

RFD1, Dairy road!

This is too much, how did you think of this?

Just came to me. Smart, uh?

Well, not bad, not for a woman,
is not bad at all!

Oh, you were complaining last night,
now, were you?

Woaa... last night we were going at each
other like bunnies.

And the sky was lighting up
like New Year's Eve.

No, I wasn't complaining at all.

What was that thing?

Oh... who the hell knows?
We were both crapped.

Mm-mm, we sure were, weren't we?

You wanna do it again?

Do I?
Do you?

Oh, boy!! Howdy do I!!

Here, this too.

What are you digging up
on that farm o'yours?

There're are some stumps in the
back that need clearing...

Well, if you dig up any buried treasure
save some for me.

I wouldn't mind being a lady of leisure,
I can tell you that.

Hey, there you two.
Hilly needs more batteries.

Then you try the mall over Augusta.

I'm cleaned out! They are really 
run on'em lately.

Seems like everybody wants'em.

...alright now, before we hear from
our He-Devil

 who is patiently standing by,
I want you to tell our viewers

each one of you, exactly what it is
that you like in a men.

And we're starting right here with Wendy,
What do you like in a man?

When they made a man like you,
Chaz Steward, they broke the mold...

what are you doing tonight?
Well, Gosh, I'm kind of busy, otherwise...

Girls, how would our He-Devil 
answer this question?

<i > Sex is good, but (... ) is better.

Joe?

Fishing... fishing is better.

Do you still love me, Joe?

What is this?
I mean... what? Do I still what...?

What kind of a dim bold question
is that, anyway?

It's just lately you don't seem to show it.

I don't believe you, I really don't... 

Tell me the truth, Joe.

No! you're crazy!

I'm sorry, honey... I'm not... Geez!

Why are you so mean to me?
What changed you like this?

I have nothing, I'm just the same
as I always was!

Where are my keys?

Where are you going?

How dare you ask me that question?

I'm going out now and I'll be back when
I want to, you got it?

But, Joe...
You got it?
 
But Joe...!
Do you got it?

But Joe!!!
But, but, but, but...!

See, I never wanna hear that word again,
I never wanna hear "but" again because

"but" is what a goat has for brains.

and "but" is for the small minded people,
in this small minded town.

Bye!

And "but" is what you say

when you want to get away
from your stupid wife!

<i> Oh, he must think you were born yesterday,
born yesterday to believe such bull! </i>

Listen, Becka!... Joe... he's been cheating on you!

It must be heat stoke, I'd better
call the infirmary.

Naaa.. Calm down, Becka, chill out... 
let's not have a heart attack over this.

Okay, Chaz...

Listen, one thing you gotta get straight:
you are not going crazy.

TV's don't talk...

Well, Becka, it appears that this one does.

And besides, we got a lot to talk about.

About Joe, for one thing, and his infidelities...
He's having an affair...

You got it! I mean, he's been pumping to
that hussy down at the post office just about

every lunch hour and around quitting time too.

Oh... what am I gonna do?

What are you gonna do?
Hey, why don't we ask our contestants? 

Okay, ladies, I want you put
yourselves in Becka's shoes.

What would you do?

Kill him.
Kill him.
Kill him.

Well, there you have it, Becka...
It's unanimous.

Kill him?

Isn't this... something?

What-a-big it is!

What-a-what it is?

Maybe it's an ancient temple from
another civilization.

Or a... you know, piece of the Mayan trea--.
Hey!

Maybe it's the Atlantis.

Hell! Pete is an indication that could
be the fountain of youth.

Bobbi, you think maybe we should
tell somebody about this?

Somebody? Who?

I don't know! Maybe we should just uh... tell--

...maybe we should tell the authorities, ok?

Oh, no.. no!

All right, Ruth Merrill, then.

Why? Because she's my friend?

She is a cop, Gard, she'd go to the Feds.

Well, would that be so bad?

Gard what are you talking about?
I mean, how can you say that?

You think our government will be
completely satisfied...

until we have a glow in the dark?

I mean, I found this amazing thing
and you want me to through it over to them?

Gard, they will come here with trucks...

filled with wire and men with guns.

They'll gag us, Gard!

And you know that they would do it.

You really do hold for it, you know
that, don't you?

I learned from the master.

Okay... okay!

Okay? So, until we know what this is
we'll just keep it between us, alright?

Not a word to anybody.

Good afternoon, Bobbi.
What can I do for you?

Yeah, I've got a piece of registered mail.

Joe, you got that package
for Anderson back there?

<i> Oh, God! He's so hot, I can't stand it </i>.

Excuse me?

I didn't say anything.

Here you go, Bobbi.
Hi, Joe. Thanks.

<i> Ah, Geez, look at his hair.</i>

<i> I haven't been this horny
since I was 16.</i>

<i> Last thing I need is his wife knowing
what we're up to. </i>

Is there anything else?

Give my regards to Becka.

Gard, I'm telling you, I could read
their minds!

Sense that they're having an affair maybe...

but, come on, read their minds?

Yeah!
Well, you're very intuitive, you always
know what the hell I'm gonna say next...

Yeah... you are probably right.

I know I'm right.

I know I'm tired, and that we
should go to bed.

Naaa... I'm not really tired, I just..
wanna write a little bit.

I hope you have better luck tonight.

Don't stay up too late.

What you doing, Hill?

Out! I gotta get ready for the show!
But... Hilly!

The Medici Princes used to have
people executed...

...if they were caught looking at
the tricks ahead of time.

Now... out!


Ladies and gentlemen...

my grandson has a surprise for all of you.

A magical treat of his own,
I repeat, of his own devicing!

I give you... Hillman, the magnificent!

Ladies and gentlemen...

for my first trick, I want you
to watch closely...

... as the mysteries of the Orient take ahold.

Prest-o change-o, the disappearing tomato!

Prest-o change-o, return!

That's my radio...

Now... for the disappearing radio...

Prest-o change-o, return!

It's time for the grand finale!

The disappearing... human.

Now, I need an assistant...
Barney Applegate?

No way man... Forget it!

Come here, Davey.
Don't want to!

Do what I say...

It's okay, Davey, go ahead.

But Hilly, I am scared.
Do it and I'll give you anything!

All your GI Joe's?

Every one! Just get up here now.

Hilly...!
Off you go, know that you can...

'cause I learned this trick
from the Tommyknocker man.

Prest-o... Majest-o... disappear!

No... wait, wait, wait. I'm not done!

Enough, Hilly, get your brother
and come on in to open the presents.

His not under here.. damn it!

Hilly, don't swear... get your brother
out of there and come on in

we'll open your presents.

Prest-o change-o, return...
Prest-o change-o, return!

Please God... I'm sorry...

He can have all my GI Joe's....

Anything! I swear it!
Just let him come back!

What's wrong, son?

I'll do anything... just bring him back!
Bring him back now!

What does he mean?
Who is he talking to?

I don't know.

Hilly! You stop fooling around
and get Davey back! Now!

I'm trying but I can't!
I try, okay!?

Okay, where is he, honey?
Where did Davey go?

I don't know!  I don't know where things go
when they stop being here...!

Come back, Davey, come back!

I'm sure there's a logical explanation, Ev.

Probably, he sleeps somewhere in the grass.

Without any of us seeing it?
He would never have gone
all by himself... never....

Honey, you know little boys, okay?
I mean...

He's been gone one hour, I'm
sure he's gonna turn up.

You've got to find him before dark.

You've got to!

Hilly... How did you think up this trick?

The voices... they told me what to do
and how to do it.

What voices?

I don't know... I don't know!

Take it easy, son.
This is all your fault!

I wish you'd never given me that
stupid magic set in the first place!

No Hilly, you don't mean that.
Yes I do!

I hate magic and I hate him!

All right everybody, listen up!

We're gonna search this town
from top to bottom.

First I want you to divide into groups.

One group go up and down Main Street...

I want you to check every building,
store and house...

...and don't forget to knock on every door.

Now, Ev, Gard, Bobbi... you 
come with Butch and me.

We'll search "Burning Woods".
I've got a little boy lost here today...

and I wanna find him before nightfall.

Well... what you're all looking at?
Come on! Let's go find him!

I'm sure we'll find him, Ev.

Oh, yeah? How do you know he's lost?

I guess I know how you must feel but...

No, no... You don't know I feel.

It's you, Petey. It's just me!

Peter, no! Down!!

Oh, Ruth, I'm sorry.

What the hell is the matter with him, Bobbi?

I don't know, he's been acting
really weird lately...

Well, he's acting like a regular Cujo!

What? What? What do you hear?
I heard something over there.

All right.

That was close!

Missing Child Hotline.

No, father, no sign of the poor little lamb.

He's... he's abducted, right?

I'm afraid so. There's no rational explanation.

He could not have gotten past the search
area without being taken by somebody.

We've got an APB out, somebody'll spot him.

But... your men will keep
looking for him, won't they?

Sure, Ev.

Well, we'll start again at first light.

You just can't leave him out there
all by himself all night!

Yeah, what do you mean "at first light"?
Brian, what are we gonna do?

Oh, honey, let's just let'em do their job.

We'll find him, Marie.

Everything will be fine, just let'em do their job.
I know we will.

Becka, you look exhausted.

Why don't you go on home
and take care of Joe?

What?

Oh, Joe left the search early,
said he was coming out with the flu.

I'll mend the phones.

I'll go see how he is.

I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Okay.

Thanks, Becka.

Missing Child Hotline.

I tell you, that kid Davey, could be the
best thing that ever happened to us.

If we are lucky he could be missing for a week.

What about Becka?

No, no, forget it. Forget it, Becka's gonna be manning
those phones day and night until they find him.

Day and night.

Night and day.

Joe, are you alright? Joe?

Final Passion.

<i> Ah, very good Becka, now, 
easy down there.

<i> Yeah, that's right, now, that red wire.

<i> No, no, not there... Yeah, there...

I'm just no good at this, I'm too clumpsy.

Not a lot of welding, don't you feel sorry,
he's been a devil to you, Becka.

What if there's some other explanation
for the lipstick?



What then?

Then, I have to do something about it.

Yeah... and you are! You are.

Any luck finding the boy?

Uh... man, we looked high and low
but there was just no sign of that kid.

Thou shall not suffer a liar.
Uh?

I said: that's too bad.

Sorry, champ, I guess the odds
didn't pick you as their perfect date.

Ah... would you turn this junk off?
I mean, I hate this show.

Turn it off yourself.

What did you say to me?

I said you could damn well turn it
off yourself, if you so want it.

What the hell is the matter with you
talking to me like that?

That's it! Good night and good date.

<i > "The Buffalo Soldiers"
A New Novel by Roberta Anderson.

<i> For Gard, my partner in the quest.

Please come back...

If you just come back, I'll give you
all my GI Joe's...

Snake Eyes, Crystal Ball.

Even the Terror Drome.

Hilly! Help me!

Davey?

It's cold and dark and I wanna
come home, Hilly.

Where are you, Davey? Where are you?

I'm with the Tommyknockers. Help me!

How? I don't know how.
Please, Davey...

Who are you talking to?

Where is Davey?

I don't know!

I don't know where things go
when they stop being here.

I never disappeared anything that was
alive before...

Help me someone!

GI Joe's... GI Joe's...
He's delirious... He was talking to Davey.

He said the Tommyknockers got him.

I'll take him into the hospital in Derry

No, no, no... You two stay here.
I'll take Hilly to the hospital,

I'll call you as soon as I spoke with
a doctor. And pray for us.

You'll be okay... I'll get the door.

Everything'll be okay, Hilly.


You'll be okay, honey...

Well?

Best thing you've ever written.

Thanks. I think it is too.

So, when was this... uh.. done?

Last night... in my sleep.

It's impossible...

Well, not with my word recorder, it ain't.

Telepathic typewriter, uh?
God Bobbi!

What's it like this... feeling?

It's a high, it's an incredible high.

What about you? You don't fell anything?

Nothing, not a jot, not an ounce
of poetic inspiration...

Nothing.

You will, it just doesn't happen all at once.

I suppose you're right.

Maybe it's the old plate in my head, uh?

Let us take the day off.

I thought you said you want to go
out there and dig today.

Well... I... we've been working too hard.

Did you know that it's the 4th of July?

What we'll do? Go into town and wave a flag?

Yeah... maybe...

Um... well l just know that we have to be there.

I just wanna welcome all of you
to our 4th of July celebration.

As you know, our community has
suffered greatly during these past few days.

We've lost our beloved postman, Joe Paulson.

And we pray for a speedy recovery
for his wife Becky.

Our hearts and our prayers go out to
the Brown family in their hour of need

as we continue our search for their son, Davey.

And yet, in the face of all these tragedies

our community has really joined together.

I'm very proud of you.

Would you please rise now and join
me in singing National?





What's happening? Bobbi!

Late last night and the night before,

Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door...

I wanna go out, I... I don't know if I can.

It's alright, I'm here...
Gramps is here.

'cause I... I learned this trick
from... the Tommyknocker men.

Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door...

Tommyknockers...

Tommyknockers...

Tommyknockers...

knocking at the door!
