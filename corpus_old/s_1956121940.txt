>> Joey, take it through
the combination again.

>> They're looking
pretty good, huh?

>> Sure are.

I still think that she
should give Grant a call.

I mean, he's the best
trainer in the whole state,

possibly the whole nation.

>> Well, I think Avery burnt
that bridge a long time ago.

>> Hey, this has
nothing to do with her.

Look, I'm just saying, wouldn't
hurt her to reach out to him.

He's an Olympic medalist
after all.

>> All right.

I'll think about it.

>> Joey.

>> She looks good, doesn't she?

>> You do.

You know what, sweetheart?

I think two of you
have a good shot

at winning that prize money.

>> God. Maybe if
we get top place,

then we can save the farm.

>> Oh yeah.

No pressure, huh?

>> Yeah. [Laughter] What
the hell do they want?

>> I don't know.

Why don't you to take Capri, go
rinse her off, wrap her legs.

I'll take care of this.

>> What?

>> Go on, get out of here.

>> Fine.

>> Nice little pony.

I'm sure it's going to be a
shame when I take her from you.

>> What do you guys want?

>> I just came by
to see my new ranch.

>> This ain't your property.

>> It will be soon enough.

>> Look, the auction date
isn't for another six weeks.

>> Where the hell are you going
to get $50,000 in six weeks?

Why don't you take me up on
my offer, make a little money,

and save yourself
the embarrassment?

And if you sign today, I'll
let sweet little Jolene keep

her pony.

>> Why don't the two of you get
off my property before I shoot

you for trespassing?

>> Suit yourself.

But my patience

and my generosity are
running out quick.

>> Whatever.

[ Music ]

>> This is it.

>> Wow, nice place.

>> Thanks.

Can I get you drink?

>> Sure.

Is this you?

>> Yeah.

>> Thank you.

I didn't know you ride.

>> I don't anymore.

>> Well, congrats to
a successful opening.

>> To a successful opening.

>> So, I guess now that
the project is finished,

we don't work together
anymore, do we?

>> Oh yeah, I guess
technically we don't.

>> So then that means I
can finally kiss you, huh?

>> I think it does.

>> You have no idea how
long I've waited to do that.

>> I do.

[ Music ]

>> It's all mine.

[ Music ]

[ Music and Moaning ]

Is it good?

>> Oh yeah.

>> Yeah?

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> That is perfect.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Fuck.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> That was amazing.

[ Music and Moaning ]

It's incredible.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Yeah, we should have
quit a long time ago.

[ Moaning ]

>> Sweetheart, I've
been thinking.

I didn't mean to put
all this on you, I mean,

with the drought last year
and your mom's medical bills.

>> Daddy, it's OK.

It's not your fault.

I just-- I'm nervous, like
I've never done a show this

big before.

I've only done small
little county shows.

I just hope those fancy
Dallas riders don't outdo us.

>> OK. I have faith in you.

>> Thank you, daddy.

Still, I think it
should be Avery.

She always was a
better rider than me.

And she's way better
under pressure than me.

>> Well, your sister clearly
has different priorities.

I mean, after the accident
with Ziggy and falling

out with Grant, that
girl couldn't wait

to get out of Texas.

>> Well, have you even
told her what's going on?

>> Nah, she won't give a shit.

>> You can't be serious.

Thunder Creek is her home too.

Daddy, you need to talk to her.

>> I'll talk to her
when she calls me.

>> You know, you're
both so damn stubborn.

>> Aren't you afraid
your father's going

to catch you sneaking
out sometime?

>> Nah.

He sleeps like a log.

>> What do you think
he'd do if he caught us?

>> Us? Wow, I think he
just might shoot you.

>> That's great.

That's just great.

>> It's the truth.

>> Well, I suppose
I'd die happy.

>> You suppose.

>> Oh, come on, Joey.

You know I love you.

>> I love you too.

>> Then why won't you marry me?

Come away with me.

You know my father
will never understand

that the rodeo just
isn't important to me.

And in his words, I will
never be a real rancher.

>> OK. Where would we even go?

>> Virginia.

You can take Capri and
work on your riding.

What do you say?

>> Cody, you know
I can't do that.

It would break my
father's heart.

Besides, this is my home.

>> Yeah, I know.

[ Music ]

>> Hey, son.

>> Yeah?

>> You got that shit done yet?

>> Almost, almost done.

>> Good, because you
got some training to do.

>> Training?

>> Yeah. I've entered
you and Gallyman

in the Big Star horse trial.

>> What on Earth for?

You always said that jumping
and dressage was for pussies

and that real man
rode the rodeo.

>> Well, I got wind that West

and his bitch little
daughter have entered to try

to win the prize money
to save their ranch.

I want you to prevent

that because I want
Thunder Creek for myself.

>> So what did you want
to talk to me about?

>> God, you are beautiful.

You know that shorts
that drive me crazy.

>> Well, why do you
think I wore them?

>> Damn it, woman.

[ Music ]

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Don't you like my shorts?

>> I do love these shorts.

>> Better on the ground though.

>> Much better on the ground.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> I think I'm going to cum.

>> Yeah, baby, cum.

[ Music and Moaning ]

So, what was it you
needed to talk to me about?

>> Huh?

>> The thing you
needed to talk to me

about before we-- you know?

>> Oh shit, I almost forgot.

Look, I got something
big to tell you.

>> OK.

>> You're not going to like this
but my dad entered me to compete

against you in the
Big Star horse trials.

>> On Gallyman?

>> Yeah.

>> He's imported from England.

He's trained by Grant Myers.

>> I know, I'm sorry.

>> No one can beat him

>> I know.

Joey, where you're going?

>> To practice.

>> Hey, Joey, come back!

Joey!

>> Hey.

>> You have call on line 2.

>> Oh, take a message.

>> I think you're going
to want to take this.

It's your father.

He said your sister
had an accident.

>> Oh my god.

>> You got here fast.

>> Yeah, my boss told
me to use the jet.

>> Fancy that.

>> Can you just tell
what happened?

>> All right.

She was schooling cross
country when Capri tripped.

She got herself a mild
concussion but she's--

she wore a helmet and
she's going to be fine.

Bad news is that she's
not going to be able

to ride for another month.

>> Which means she won't be able
to compete and save the ranch.

>> What is he talking about?

[ Beeping ]

>> Don't worry about it.

I'm going to get
a cup of coffee.

>> Would you just please tell
me what the hell is going on?

>> Your dad ain't able to pay
back the loan that he took

out to pay for your mom's
treatment and final expenses.

The bank's going to auction off
the ranch in a couple of weeks.

>> What? Are you serious?

>> Yup.

>> Dad. Dad, don't
you walk away from me.

>> You need to mind
your own business.

>> Mind my own business, really?

The last time I checked,
I was part of this family

and Thunder Creek
was my home too.

>> The last time I checked,
your home was in New York.

Besides that, what are you
going to do, Avery, huh?

You're going to leave
your fancy job

to take your sister's
place at the horse show?

>> Come one, you know
that's not possible.

>> Exactly.

>> Hey! Dad!

[ Music ]

>> Hey. Are you OK?

>> Not really.

How did things get so messed up?

>> Your dad took it pretty hard

when you didn't come
back for Betsy's funeral.

>> I know.

I was in Paris working on the
biggest campaign of my career.

Mom made me promise
not to come back.

She didn't want me to miss

out on the opportunity
because of her.

I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

I tried to explain that to him.

>> I know.

>> So, what do I do?

>> Well, you'll figure it out.

Why don't you sleep on it?

It's been one hell of a day.

>> What about Joey?

I can't leave her here.

>> Joey? She's sedated
for the night.

Doctors will probably
release her in the morning.

I can give you a call

if anything changes
or she wakes up.

Are you going to go
down to the ranch?

>> Absolutely not.

I'll just-- I'll
be at the motel.

>> OK.

>> Is that restaurant on
Country Road 470 still open?

>> Yeah, I'd reckon.

>> All right.

Thanks.

>> OK.

>> Avery? Is that you?

>> Hey, Mary Ann.

How are you?

>> I'm pretty good.

I hear you're getting paid

to throw fancy parties
these days, huh?

>> Well, not exactly.

I work for a PR company
that handles like press

and gift rooms for
a red carpet events.

It's really not as
cool as it sounds.

>> Yeah? Well, it's got to
be better than working here.

So what on Earth is
bringing you back here?

>> An unexpected quick visit.

>> OK. Well, you have
yourself a good night.

>> You too, bye.

>> Daisy, you're never going
to believe who I just ran into.

[ Music ]

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Stay still.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my gosh.

You're driving me crazy.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh, that's so good.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Yeah, just take them off of me.

Take those panties off.

[ Music and Moaning ]

There we go.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh my god, please
stay doing that.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

Oh yes, yes, yes.

Fuck. Oh my god.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

Oh, fuck. Oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> It's so good.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god, yeah.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

It feels so good.

Yeah. Yeah, just like that.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Just hit that perfect
spot inside me.

Yeah.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh yeah, right there,
right there.

Oh my gosh, it's so
good, so good, so good.

Just like this, do
it just like that.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god.

>> I'm going to cum inside you.

>> Yes.

>> Right now.

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Why are you always
in such a rush to leave?

You know you can stay.

>> Daisy, we talked about this.

Remember, we have
an arrangement?

Look, if you don't like the
arrangement, I can understand.

>> No, that's OK.

>> Daisy, I like
you, I really do.

But I'm just not
ready to be involved.

That's all.

That's all it is.

>> I know.

I like you too.

I guess I won't be
seeing you much though

since Avery is back
in town and all.

>> Avery is back?

>> Yeah. I think
she got in tonight.

My sister called me and said
that she saw her at the diner.

>> Thanks for the warning.

Bye.

>> Bye.

>> See you.

>> [Phone Ringing] Hello?

>> When were you going
to tell me then, huh?

>> What, about Jolene's
accident?

She's getting ready to compete.

>> No-- Wait a minute, what?

What happened to Jolene?

The Big Star horse trials.

Are they insane?

>> Nah, just desperate.

The only way to stop
that foreclosure is

to win that prize money.

>> Wow. Well, we all know
there's only one horse

in that ranch with a
shot at winning that,

and that ain't the
one Jolene is riding.

I guess, I'll pop
up at Thunder Creek

and check in on Capri for her.

>> I bet.

>> And what is that
supposed to mean?

>> Nothing.

You know, if you're
hoping to run into Avery

over there, she ain't.

She's down at the motel.

>> Oh good, because I ain't.

[ Phone Ringing ]

>> Hello? How are you feeling?

They let you out already?

I do not think that's
a good idea.

I don't think dad
wants me at the ranch.

OK, OK. All right,
give me an hour.

OK, I'll be-- I will be
there in an hour, I promise.

[ Music ]

I can't believe the doctor
cleared you to ride already.

>> He didn't.

>> Joey.

>> Come on, Avery.

I'll die if I can't ride.

>> Oh my god, don't
be such a drama queen.

You need your rest.

>> Fine. I'll rest but you
got to do me a favor first

>> Oh really?

And what exactly is that?

>> Riding the Big
Star horse trials.

>> Dad put you up to this?

>> No, why?

>> Because he said the
same thing last night.

>> Seems like great
minds think alike, huh?

>> More like desperate times
call for desperate measures.

>> Call it what you want.

Are you in?

>> Absolutely not.

I don't even ride anymore.

>> You're riding right now.

>> Don't be as smartass, Joey.

You and I both know that
this is very different

than riding in an event.

I haven't jumped
a horse in years.

People die doing that shit.

I mean, I haven't
really ridden since--

you know, and I don't even want

to know how bad my
dressage would be.

>> Come on, it's
like riding a bike.

>> Like riding a bike?

>> Yeah.

>> A 2,000-pound bike with
an attitude problem maybe.

>> Avery, you're
our last chance.

You don't want me to move
in New York with you, right?

>> No. Yeah.

This is all a moot point anyway.

I don't even have
a horse to ride.

>> You could ride Leo.

>> Mom's horse?

>> Yeah.

>> Are you crazy?

Or is that just the
concussion talking?

>> He's the best horse at
this ranch, you know that.

>> Yeah, I know that,
but no one can ride him.

>> You can.

>> Forget it, Joey.

[ Phone Ringing ]

>> Hey, hold on.

Hey, can you take this?

>> OK.

>> I'm sorry, thank you.

How are you?

[ Music ]

>> You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

>> No. And who are
you on the phone with?

>> Don't change the subject.

But if you must know, it
was a boy that I'm seeing.

Anyway, back to you.

I know you're lying.

>> Oh yeah?

How do you know that?

>> Because I'm your sister.

I know you better than anybody.

I used to sit on the fence

and watch mom give you
lessons, I was so jealous.

It came so natural
to you, Avery.

It's in your blood.

And you'll never quit.

And if you do, it would
be your biggest regret.

[ Music ]

>> What can I get you?

>> A vodka tonic, please.

[ Music ]

>> So it is true.

>> What? Oh, nice
to see you as well.

I see some things never change.

>> You're going to ride Leo in
the Big Star horse trials then?

>> Where did you get
an idea like that?

>> Your sister.

>> Damn it, Joey.

>> Well, are you going to do it?

>> I don't think
that's a very good idea.

>> You got a better one,
because they'll lose

that ranch if you don't?

>> Why are you putting
this on me?

It's not my fault my
dad got in over his head

and can't pay his bills.

>> To save your mother while
you was off leaving as gallivant

and going around the globe.

>> So as usual, this
is about you.

>> Oh no. This is all about you.

>> And let me guess.

You're volunteering to coach me.

>> I'll help you.

And I ain't doing it for
you, I'm doing for them.

>> Jesus. I'm out of here.

[ Music ]

>> Well, I guess
the rumor is true.

[ Music ]

>> You two seriously don't think
you stand a chance, do you?

A washed up drunk and has
been on her sister's horse?

>> Yeah, I really do.

I think we've got a good chance.

Avery is going to ride Leo,
and my bet, is going to win.

>> Careful now.

Remember what happened
last time you let

that whiskey get
courageous for you?

>> Careful, Bill.

I think he wants to hit you.

[ Laughter ]

How precious.

[ Music ]

[ Knocking ]

>> No, thank you.

[ Knocking ]

I'm up.

It's 6:00 a.m.

>> Yup. Your sister's
riding clothes.

>> OK.

>> Hurry up.

Get dressed.

Leo is in the trailer.

Training begins now.

>> I don't remember
agreeing to this.

[ Music ]

I'm not blowing you
off, I swear.

It's just I got here
and apparently,

they need me to ride
in the show.

Yeah, no, no, yeah, on a horse.

I look forward to it.

OK. I'll call you
in a couple days.

Bye.

[ Music ]

>> I mean, look at your
position over [inaudible].

I can't believe how much you've
improved in the last few weeks.

>> Maybe my sister
was right after all,

not that I'm going
to tell her that.

>> Well, of course not.

>> So, do you really think
Leo and I have a shot at this?

>> Yeah, I really do.

I actually think
you can win this.

That's just textbook.

>> OK. It must be
the good coaching.

>> Oh yeah, keep
on the flattery.

[ Music ]

>> What did you find out?

>> I hate to say it.

She looks good.

>> How good?

>> Good enough that we have
a serious fucking problem.

>> You know what to do.

>> Yeah.

>> Hey, what's going on?

>> You don't worry about it.

Pull.

[ Gunshots ]

Pull.

[ Gunshots ]

>> Roy is going to hurt Leo.

>> And how do you know that?

>> Cody told me.

>> And why the hell
would he do that?

>> Cody and Gallyman are
our biggest competition,

not to mention that his dad
wants to take our ranch.

What?

>> Jolene, what are
you not telling me?

Oh my god, it's Cody.

The just a boy you're seeing, I
can't believe you would do this.

>> What? What's the big deal?

>> What's the big deal?

You are literally
sleeping with the enemy.

>> Well, at least
I'm not a hypocrite.

I'm not afraid to be with the
person I'm in love with, OK?

>> What the fuck are
you talking about?

>> Avery, come on.

You've been in love with Grant

since you were like
17 years old.

>> You're crazy.

You wait until dad
finds out about this.

>> Jesus. What was
that all about?

>> She swears that Roy's
men are going to try

to hurt Leo or something.

>> Yeah, well, I've
already thought that.

Tom is going to be
spending the night

in the barn with
Leo from now on.

>> Well, that's a
relief, I guess.

>> I mean, I thought
you guys are fighting

over her seeing Cody.

>> Wait. You know about that?

>> Yeah. I mean, come
on, nothing gets past me.

It's a small town.

>> You can't seriously
approve of that relationship.

>> That's not my place.

But anyway, Cody is a good kid.

He ain't nothing
like his father.

>> Does my dad know?

>> Absolutely not.

And that also isn't my place.

>> You can't tell me it
doesn't bother you, I mean,

to see him riding around on the
horse his father practically

stole from you.

>> Yeah. It kills me.

It kills me every bloody
day, but I only got myself

to blame for that, haven't I?

That's why I quit drinking,
just fed up with seeing things

in that and they just
slip from my fingers.

>> Your charm won't
work on me, Grant.

We're not kids anymore.

>> Trust me, Avery, I know.

I think you need to go and load
that horse on that trailer.

We have a bloody show to win.

Come on.

[ Music ]

>> And a big welcome to the 14th
Annual Big Star Horse Trials.

Official show time is
8:00 a.m. You are expected

to be on time to start.

Dressage at 9:00
a.m. Competitors,

if you have not checked
in at the show office,

please do so at this time.

[ Music ]

>> I wasn't sure if you
were going to come or not.

>> She's still my daughter.

Win or lose, I'm proud of her.

>> You know what, Wes?

You probably should
tell her that.

[ Knocking ]

>> Come on.

The dressage starts
in half an hour.

>> I'm coming.

How do I look?

>> You look fantastic.

Let's do this, shall we?

>> Yeah.

>> Come on.

>> In the ring now is
number 94, Avery Montgomery.

[ Music ]

>> That's it.

[ Music ]

Good. Straight.

[ Music ]

That's it.

Go up to the line.

That's it.

Perfect home.

Perfect home.

Oh yeah.

[ Applause ]

That was awesome.

Well done.

>> That's it?

>> I guess.

Let's go.

[ Music ]

>> And in the show jump
ring now is number 45,

Cody Stevenson and Gallyman.

And that's a double
clear round for the pair.

Our last rider of
the day is number 94,

Avery Montgomery riding
Thunder Creek's Leonardo.

[ Music ]

>> Come on.

[ Music ]

[ Applause ]

>> Good job.

>> And then this fight
would be a little sticky

in the combination, she jumps
clearly with no time falls.

>> How soon do they
post the scores?

>> They post them
when they post them.

>> Hi. You did so good.

>> Thank you.

>> You looked amazing.

>> Thanks.

>> Certainly, Leo
looked so good.

>> Tommy is looking
after Leo so we can go

and walk the cross-country
course.

>> Cool. Are you
going to come with us?

>> No. I got other plans
but I'll take this from you.

>> Oh, thanks.

Where's dad?

>> You know him.

He must be very nervous.

Probably off back
to the hotel by now.

>> Right.

>> Relax. He saw your rides.

Come on. Let's go do this.

>> OK.

>> After you.

>> Thank you.

>> Sally? Sally,
are you in here?

>> Sally, where are you?

>> Boo!

>> Jesus Christ.

Damn it, girl.

You almost gave me
a heart attack.

Look, I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

>> Does that mean
you want me to leave?

>> No, that's not what I said.

>> What took you so long?

>> I came here as
fast as I could.

This is a really important show.

>> Well, I hope you're
not mad that I came.

I couldn't stand to be away
from you for a whole weekend.

>> Sally, I'm not mad
at all, not at all.

In fact, you know, you
just made my whole day.

>> Well, good, because
I'm just getting started.

>> Oh really?

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> I can't wait to
get my hands on you.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> I like the way that
moves just like that.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> It tastes so good.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> I got to take my hat
back on and watch this.

[ Music and Moaning ]

You wore my favorite ones.

>> I knew you like it.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Do you feel good, Sally?

>> It's very good.

>> Yeah?

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh god, Sally.

You're so beautiful.

[ Music and Moaning ]

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> You remember the course?

>> Yeah, I think so.

>> Well, you got any questions?

>> Well, I'm nervous
about the water,

never actually dropped
in before.

You think Leo will be all right?

>> Well, just sit, count
your strides, yeah.

What are you looking
so happy about?

>> Well, Sally came by
and, hey, scores are in.

You guys are tied for first.

>> Me and Cody.

>> It's all down to
cross-country now.

Have you seen Jolene?

>> I haven't seen her
in a couple hours.

>> Hey.

>> But I know where she's at.

>> Listen, you go
get some sleep.

Go back to the trailer.

You got a big day tomorrow.

>> Goodnight.

>> Goodnight.

>> So how'd the course look?

>> Big and scary.

But Grant seemed to think
Leo and I can do it.

>> Well, Grant is
the professional.

I don't think he'd put you on
anything you weren't ready for,

plus he cares about
you a whole lot.

>> Well, I don't
know about that.

>> Come on.

You haven't seen the
way he looks at you?

He never got over you leaving.

>> Well, he doesn't
have anyone to blame

for that but himself, does he?

I mean, it was very
clear that he cared more

about drinking than he did me.

You know, maybe if he'd
have been sober the morning

of the championships,

we wouldn't have gotten
into that argument.

And if we hadn't have
gotten into that argument,

then I wouldn't have
been distracted

and I wouldn't have missed
my spot to the last jump.

>> You don't think
he knows that?

>> It doesn't matter
anymore anyway.

It's like not anything
can bring Ziggy back.

I just need to get
through this weekend

and get back to New York.

>> Are you seriously saying you
don't have feelings for Grant?

>> Oh my god, Joey,
it's not that simple.

Grant and I have a lot
of history and, you know,

some things just can't be fixed.

>> Well, how do you
know unless you try?

>> Shouldn't you be off
with Cody somewhere?

>> Cody is my boyfriend.

You're my sister.

And right now, my
place is here with you.

[ Phone Ringing ]

>> Speaking of Romeo, he's
calling you right now.

[ Phone Ringing ]

>> Hey, Cody.

Slow down, slow down.

Are you sure?

OK.

>> What's wrong?

>> We have to go.

>> What?

>> I'll drive.

You call Grant.

>> OK.

Are you going to tell
me what's going on?

[ Music ]

>> What you got there?

[ Music ]

Come on.

[ Music ]

>> What the hell are you doing?

>> Avery, this son of a bitch
tried to drug our horse.

>> What?

>> Let's say, we take this
straight to the show official,

get this guy disqualified,
then I'm calling the police.

>> No. I want the
satisfaction of beating you.

>> You're about as
stupid as your old man.

You do have a good horse going

but you don't have a snowball
chance in hell of beating mine.

>> Funny that you
mentioned that.

Speaking of Gallyman, what do
you say we make things a little

more interesting?

>> Avery.

>> Care to make a wager?

>> What do you have
in mind, darling?

>> Winner takes loser's horse?

>> What do you think
you're doing?

She can't do that.

>> Yes, I can.

I own Leo, not you.

What do you say, Mr. Stevenson?

Do we have a deal?

>> When we win, not only am
I going to take your horse,

but I'm going to take
your daddy's ranch too.

Get up.

>> What the hell do
you think you're doing?

>> I think I just
got your horse back.

Good night, Grant.

Get some rest.

We have a big day tomorrow.

You too, Leo, go to bed.

>> What the hell just happened?

[ Music ]

>> Welcome to our final
day of the competition

at the Big Star Horse Trials.

We're expecting an exciting
afternoon of cross-country

as the riders face off for
over $50,000 in prizes.

There's less than three points
dividing the top four riders

and the tie for first place.

>> So, are you nervous?

>> A little.

OK, a lot.

>> It's about that time.

I'm going to go get Leo ready.

>> OK.

>> I'll help.

>> I should be going too.

>> Avery, I just wanted you to
know that regardless if you win

or lose, I love you and
I'm very proud of you.

I know your mom would be too.

>> I love you too.

>> Now, let's get you up on
that horse and go kick some ass.

>> Yes, sir.

>> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

Go. Have a nice ride.

>> Leaving the Star box now and
tied for the lead is number 94,

Avery Montgomery and
Thunder Creek's Leonardo.

[ Music ]

>> Come on, come on, here we go.

>> Here we go.

>> Yes. Go, go, go, go.

>> All right.

>> -- score 37.

Out on the course now, Cody
Stevenson and Gallyman.

[ Music ]

>> OK, here they come.

>> His time is neck in neck with
Avery Montgomery as he goes--

>> Where the hell is he going?

>> What the fuck?

>> He's going to go
through the flags.

>> Goddamn it.

>> He just gave himself
a technical elimination.

>> What a stupid mistake.

>> He did it for love.

Look behind you.

>> Hey, go get your horse.

[ Music ]

>> I didn't expect
to see you here.

>> I didn't expect to be here.

But I didn't to leave town
without giving you this.

I think you earned it.

>> It was teamwork.

>> Yeah.

>> Thank you.

>> Yeah. Well, I'll
see you around.

>> Avery, wait.

There's something I want
a little more than that.

Remember when I told you I
was sick of losing things

that really meant a lot to me?

>> Yeah.

>> Well, I was talking
about you.

I don't think you've realized
how much you mean to me.

I think it's about
time I showed you.

[ Music ]

[ Music and Moaning ]

He hasn't forgotten you.

[ Music and Moaning ]

>> Oh my god, yes.

[ Music and Moaning ]

Oh my god, it feels so good.

>> Yeah.
