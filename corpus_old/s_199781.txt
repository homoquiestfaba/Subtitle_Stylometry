Horrible monkey!
Stand still!

Quick!
Don't let him get away!

Mind that gold staff he carries!

You asked for it!

Think you can have a birthday party
without inviting me?

Think again!

No birthday party swings
without my gold staff!

Damn it!

Now it's your turn!
Get down!

I've had enough of this

Don't let him slip away!

You unruly little monkey!

How dare you break into the Palace
and eat the Peaches ofHeaven?

You'll pay the price for this
wickedness!

In the name of Buddha, I will bind
you for five hundred years!

You must accompany the monk
Tripitaka on his Journey to the West

He travels in search of sacred
Buddhist scriptures

You will wear this Ring ofPain
from now on

If you get up to any mischief, the ring
will squeeze your head like a lemon!

You must be kidding!

If you don't shut up, I'll show you
the power of my gold staff!

Leave me alone!

Stop it, or I'll knock your block off!

One, two, three...

Wow, you're cute

Wula!

No, Wula!
This is Little Dragon

He'll be your new best friend

Little Dragon, this is home!

Where have you hidden it?

Give me that Iron Fan!

No, I won't!

It's a precious family treasure

I won't let you lose it by

"Precious family treasure"?

Will you give it to me or will
you force me to take it?

Dad, Mama's sick!

Don't treat her like that!

I can do without lessons from you!

Dad, the fire on Mount Flame is
much worse now

So what? Your mother could
deal with it easily!

Why does Wula have to pee
everywhere?

What a bad father!

Darling, we have to keep that
secret

Otherwise people will laugh at us

Mama!

I'm sorry... Don't be angry

Red, you're a good son

Now look at all these herbs
I've found for you!

You're sure to get well now

Very good, boy! You've found
everything I need

Red, where did you find this dragon?

Cute, isn't he?

I was out picking the herbs...

Suddenly a fireball came out of
the sky...

When it hit the ground it was
like a volcano...

A volcano running for miles and miles!

And then this little dragon just
plopped down beside me!

You're making up stories again!

No, Mama, it's true

Come outside and I'll show you

See, over there!

You think the fire can reach us here?

Don't worry, we have my precious
Iron F an

Princess, time for your medicine

Here, let me help you Mama

There you go
Thank you

What an illness!

Ugh, it feels as if I've been
taking this medicine all my life!

Why don't I get any better?

Princess, you could say this medicine
has a kill-to-cure aspect...

What are you trying to say?

Well, the thing is...

T o be really effective, it needs
one more ingredient...

Ground bone of monk!

Ground bone of monk?

Where on earth can I find that?

Well, I hear from a very reliable
source that 500 years from now...

...the holy monk Tripitaka will
pass this way...

...on his quest to find a sacred scroll

He'll provide the only chance to
cure your mother

There is only one Tripitaka! T o get
ground bone of monk, you'll need to...

Catch the monk!
Bingo!

But a 500-year wait!

Haven't you ever heard
'As Time Goes By'?

500 years seems like a long time

But it'll pass in a flash if you
spend it getting ready

Hey, this butterfly is Pigsy!

Stop!

We have promised Buddha...

...that we'll reach the West
under our own steam

We don't take shortcuts!
Understand?

Wait!

Monkey, do not kill any living creature

Master, this place is weird

Watch out!

Amitabha!

Master!

I'll get you!

I'll flatten you!

Sorry, may I leave this here?

Monkey, watch out!

Nice move, Monkeyboy!

Where'd this little devil come from?

You dare to block my way?

T alk about a wild animal!

Who d'you think you are?

Ever seen yourself in a mirror,
Monkeyboy?

What are you on about?

And who could that be?

Must be that dumb oaf Sandy!

You think that's funny, Pork Pie?

You must be Pigsy, the stupidest fatso!

Whoever you are, I'll thank you
to mind your manners

Wow, a pig lecturing me about manners!

That's big news!

Okay, enough of this!
Hand over the monk!

Then I might let the rest of you live!
But if you don't...

My child...

I have done you no wrong

What do you want with me?

I need to grind your bones,
if you must know

Have you completely lost it?
How can you grind a living man's bones?

No problem, he'll die first

I've been waiting for you for 500 years!

Monk, you'd better give yourself up!

You think so? No way!

Get a load of this!

You're so heavy, you tub of lard!

Get off me!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

Bacon breath!


Here you are...

That's mine, give it back

Brother! Hang on to it!

Let go, you pork chop on legs!

No!

Let go, bacon breath! Let go!

You're fighting the wrong guy, kid

If you want a real scrap,
he's your man... not me

Let go!
Brother Monkey, help me!

You should fight Monkey

I'm not the monkey, I'm a pig

A smelly pig

Let go, streaky bacon!
Let go right now!

Drat! Can't let him get away!

Where'd he go?

T ake that!

Little devil, you got it coming!

Sharp toothpicks you use!

Think you're grown up, kid?

Now you're unarmed!
What are you gonna do?

You wanna challenge me?
You need another 300 years of practice!

Catch!

Thanks!

Oh!

Here...

I Give up now, Monkeyboy!

You talkin' to me?
I'll show you

Protect the Master!

Fire...

Help!

Y es, water! Water!

My pal's faster than yours!
You need years more practice!

Monkeyboy!

Do your worst!
I can dowse your flame!

No, Cloud, don't mess with him

Lost your sizzle?

Monkey!

Monkey...

Cloud!

He could be useful to me!

Okay, now hand over that monk!

You are a good son to your parents

Harming others to get your

own way is wrong

You will meditate on your mistakes
for three years

Three years?

What about my Mama?

Quick! The Great Buddha is
before us!

The Great Buddha is before us!

I don't want...

Show some respect, Pork Pie!

Thank you, Lord Buddha!

Look, Master, we can't go on!

We'd better turn back
and go home

There is always a way

Monkey, you and Pigsy scout the area
See if there's a way around

I'll look this way with Sandy

Oh, all right

Come on, Pork Pie

Couldn't I just nip home first?

I just remembered...

I think I forgot to turn off
the gas...

Look, Porker! There's an oasis!

Let's go back and tell Master

There must be someone around

Pigsy, you look around the place

Okay, I'm on it

Anybody home?

Who's there?

Oh boy, a water hole!

Don't, Pigsy!
The water could be poisoned!

Don't drink it!

Who is...

Master Mud!

Welcome!

Good to meet you, Master Mud

I'm honored to be visited
by Master Tripitaka

But please don't bathe there,
that water is very precious

Pigsy, come out at once

What's with this place?

How come it's so hot?

Is there no way
to cross those mountains?

There is a way, but it's very difficult

You need to get the Iron F an

T o cross the mountains, you need
to put out the fires first

What Iron F an is that?

It belongs to Princess Iron F an
of the Banana Cave

It's her family heirloom

It's the only thing that can
put out those fires

The Banana Cave?

That's right, Princess Iron Fan
and her husband Ox

They live in the Banana Cave,
300 leagues from here

That's great!

Ox and I are old buddies!
We go back 500 years!

Cloud...

Let's go!

What is it, Wula?

Scuse me, Ma'am, is Ox at home?

No, he's out...
Are you Monkey?

You must be the famously gorgeous
and smart Mrs Ox! Right, babe?

How dare you burst in here!

Aw, don't be like that, Sis

Ain't it cool to have a handsome guy
show up on your doorstep?

Enough of your nonsense!
Where's my son?

Your son?

Don't feign innocence!

Red went out looking for you
and he hasn't come back

Why was he attacking my Master?

So you have got him!

Cool it, Dame

He asked for it

He tried to kill my Master!

Buddha himself
locked him up to punish him

That's absurd!

Red is smart, cute and sensible

Hang about, Sis

Your nose is getting longer!

Why are you here?

The fire in the mountains
is blocking our way

So?

We need your Iron F an to blow it out

Give me back my son,
and I'll let you use the fan

Don't worry about him

He's safe in Buddha's hands

Listen, Ape!
You come here behaving like this...

...and expect me to do you a favor?

Behave yourself and accept my proposal!

Or would you rather go home?

Do you want the Iron F an or not?

As you wish!

I'll show you the power of the Iron F an!

Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

Oh, it's you again! Wondered
where you'd slithered off to

Scuse me!

I'd love to hang with you,

but I got places to go,
people to see...

Bye bye!

Fooled you!

What's with all these trees?

Buddha's in for a surprise!

It seems you're turning into
another naughty little Monkey

Let me see...

What were you saying about me
being in for a surprise?

Buddha, please don't be angry

I was just kidding

It looked to me
as if you were trying to escape

I miss my Little Dragon

And I'm worried about my Mama

Dear child, I'll grant you a visit home

But only if you'll promise me two things

I'll promise!

First, stop trying to
take Tripitaka's bones

But Mama really needs them!

She will recover without them

Don't worry

What do you mean?

You'll find out when the time comes

Okay, I promised

And the second one?

My palm is itchy

Give me a good scratch before you go!
Is that all?

Ah, that feels so good...

Wula,

you need a bath!

Where did you pick up all these fleas?

Stop playing, I'm serious
I don't like dirty fleas

Princess! Time for your medicine!

And when you've drunk it all down...

...I'll give you a good massage

Thank you for
taking such good care of me

Princess, you flatter me

Your health is my first and only concern

You're welcome

It's most efficacious
when it's hot, Princess

I don't like the smell of this!

Oh...

My stomach is killing me!

Killing... She ain't kidding!

What's going on?

Why is there a voice in my stomach?

It's me, Monkey, paying you a visited

You...
Come out of there right now, Monkey!

What allows you to invade my insides?

But I'm here,
so what are you going to do about it?

You won't get rid of me
until you give me that Iron F an

Come out first!

No way! You think I was born yesterday?

First, give me the fan!
And hurry it up!

Or I'll demonstrate my drumming skills!

The drummer in the May Day band
learned all he knows from me!

All right, all right!
Just stop that infernal drumming!

I'll give you the Iron F an

Great!

Now I need to know the spell
to make it bigger again

You can't do that
while it's still inside me!

I realise that

All right then...

So tell me the spell!

I can't!

Listen...

Don't mess me around...

...or you'll soon be
'breaking wind' as never before!

No, no! It's just that...

...I can't say it out loud.
I'll write it down for you

Then I'll swallow it

Now, will you come out?

So this is the spell!

I'll need some help...
Please sneeze!

Sneeze? I can't just sneeze to order!

Wula, come here

Help me, I need a sneeze

Not you, silly!

I need you to help me sneeze!

Thanks! Bye bye!

You damnable Monkey!

By the way, Princess...

What is that stinky toad giving you?

Inside you,
it smells like something dead!

Little dragon!

Dragon...

Dragon...

Dragon...
Come, Dragon!

Dinnertime!

Come, my lovely Dragon!
Time to eat!

Not so fast! Be good, and do as I say

Then you can have your reward!
You can get high again!

Down you go!

Good boy!
This is the biggest you've found so far!

Next time, dive even deeper...
Try even harder!

Precious stones
are Spider's best friends!

Isn't that just yummy?

You bring me even bigger stones...

...and I'll get you higher
than you've ever dreamed!

Mission accomplished!

Master!

Good work, Monkey!
I knew the Princess would be generous

You might say that!
Anyhow, you can count on me

Oh boy, can I see it?

Here it is!
T o use it, you need a good head

Is that it? What good is
a tiddly little fan like that?

Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

Don't unerestimate that F an

Say the right words and it changes!

I've memorized them!

Then all you have to is recite them

T ake aim and wave the fan at Mount Flame

Then the fires will die down

Great! Let's give it a shot right now!

But Monkey...

Now what?

You must remember...

First blow for wind, second blow
for rain, third blow for fire

But don't give it a fourth blow!

That will make the F an destroy itself!

That's enough gobbledegook!
The main thing is to put out the fire

Who cares what happens to the F an?

Monkey: Check it out!
Let's play BLOW game, baby.

It works! The fire's been put out!

Buddha be blessed

Now, let's get going

What the...? No way!

I'll try it again

The Princess is really powerful!

You're wasting our time!

Don't laugh at me, Pigsy...

...or I'll have you roasted!

Monkey, don't be reckless!

If I may make a suggestion...

It might work better...

...if Ox were holding it

You could be right

So where do I find Ox?

Where would you expect
to find a compulsive gambler?

Half Mountain Inn!

That's lucky!

Hey, Ox! Brother Ox!

You want to get trampled to death?

Ox, my old pal!

Monkey...

It's good that you showed up!

I have a score to settle with you!

Where is my son? I know you're
to blame for his disappearance

Tell me where he is!

Well, I guess I did have
a little something to do with it

You can have something
to do with my pitchfork!

Come on, Ox...

Let me explain!

Smash first, explain later

Ox, let me explain!

You gave me choice,
it was for your own good!

That's ridiculous!

Listen, Ox, we all know
how much you like gambling

None of your business!

And how you always lose!

You're asking for it!

Hey, lay off my trusty steed!

Will you listen?

I got your boy a gig with Buddha!

He even has an official job title

What job title?

Buddha's little Fortune Teller

Oh yeah?
I'd rather he was a Fortune Bringer!

You're missing the point!

Your son is loaded with fortunes!

So, with a little help from Buddha...

...you won't ever lose again!

Or you can call me Monkey!

Right...

I've lost all my crickets...

Don't worry, I give you my word

Whatever game you play, you'll win

Let me handle it! Let's go!

Okay, let's go!

I'll go along with this

But if you happen to see my boy,
please tell him...

...I really respect what he's doing

He should study hard
and become a decent man

And if he lets slip any secrets
of the fortune-making kind...

...he can drop me a line
or send me an e-mail

Of course, you'll be the first to know!

Dragon has become
hopelessly addicted to the potion

But I can't rely only on Dragon

You must act quickly!

Sure, but I need to be cunning too

I need to learn the secret spell

Otherwise I won't be able to do anything

Once I get it, everything will be fine!

Why don't you force it out of her?

Force?

You know how powerful that Iron F an is?

Of course I do!

Idiot!

I've made up my mind...

We should work through Ox too

When I lay my hands on the Iron Fan...

...I'll control everything,
just wait and see!

I won't need to waste money...

...buying potions for Dragon

I can't wait for that day!

Of course,
I won't forget your contribution

You're taking care of Ox?
Don't worry

He's dumb through and through

And I have more good news for you

Really? What's that?

Tripitaka,
the holy monk from the East, is here

Why should I care about that?

You don't understand,
he's a very holy monk

It's said that if you grind up
his bones and swallow them...

...you'll live forever

Live forever?

Mr Ox, you're a bit late today

Nonsense!

I'm always the first to arrive
in Half Mountain Inn

Listen, I'm here today
to win back everything I lost

I'm with my old pal Monkey

Lady luck is with me today

Do come in

I have to slip out for a while

What's going on?

What's gotten into you?

Stop whirling me around!

What's going on?
You're making me dizzy!

Really?

I have good news for you

I know where our son is

You big oaf, I already know!

You do?
Drat, someone's ruined my surprise

First thing tomorrow,
I'll tell Buddha to let him go

What makes you think
Buddha will release him?

I'll force him to if I have to

Force him?

Surely even you aren't stupid enough
to pick a fight with Buddha?

I can't beat Buddha,
but I can offer to swap places with Red

Buddha can lock me up instead!

That way, I won't be able to go gambling

So it will kill two birds with one stone

And you won't give me a hard time
when I come home

Are you serious?

You really mean it?

Every word!

I'll do anything for you and Red

Wula, what are you doing?

You miss Red too?

You're so eager
for me to take his place?

Wula! Bad dog!

You don't seem yourself today

I'm fine

I haven't had a drink all day

But take care while I'm out

That pesky Monkey
might come by and cause trouble again

You're usually the last one
to think about family matters

How did you know that
Monkey has been here?

I know lots of things!
I bumped into him on my way home

He wanted me to
get your Iron F an for him

He wants to steal it

He's using you to trick me?

Don't worry

I know what he's up to!

...but I'm no Dumb Ox

Whatever you say

By the way, honey...

Are you sure the Iron Fan is safe?

Of course I am

Really?

Don't be silly

Can you make sure it is?

Why would I do that?

Just to be certain

Just check that it's where it should be

How thoughtful of you

Don't mention it

It's your heirloom!

We have to be sure

It's always here

Don't worry, I'm not as careless as you!

That's a relief!

I'm glad you're so careful

You're a treasure

Thanks, Sis!

Wow, how did it get to be this size?

And how do I change it back?

I've forgotten the spell

It doesn't work...

Hey, Pork Pie! Roast Pork!

W ake up for a roast pork dinner!

No! Hey, what's up, brother?

Quick, I need your help

Help me carry this Iron F an

Looks pretty heavy!

Get in gear, you lazy pig!

I need more sleep...

If you don't help me,
I'll show you who's the boss around here

Okay, okay, I'll carry it!

You're kind of amazing,
aren't you?

You bet I am!

I twisted the Princess
around my little finger!

Right!

But watch out, that kid Red might
come looking for revenge

Red? That little squirt?

That little squirt
might get the better of you!

You must be kidding!

No, I'm serious!

Shrink!

I don't get it,
why did Buddha let you go?

Justice is always on the side
of the good guys!

I'm having a summer break!

This can't be! How do you control
the Iron F an's size like that?

You're not smart enough to understand

And to catch up with me...

...you need to be really smart

Don't run away!

I've beaten you twice,
so you should call me Mast!

But you don't play fair!

The first time,
you had a dragon helping you!

You have no shame!

You can surrender now if you like

That's not gonna happen!

How about we go one on one?
No tricks, no games, just you and me?

It's a deal!
Let's meet three days from now!

Deal!

I was too careless!

How could I lose the Iron Fan like that?

Wula, you're right!

Maybe I should just ask Ox
to come back and sort out the problem

Hold on, Wula...

What if I'm cheated by another fake Ox?

Wula, you're so smart!

He'll be drunk and dirty!

The real Ox is unmistakeable!

But what if he can't defeat Monkey?

I've lost my little Red...

I can't lose my Ox too!

Mama, I'm back!

Red!

How come you're free?

Come, let me hug you!
I've missed you so much

Buddha let me have a break

Buddha is so kind

Red, you're so sweet and clever!

Not like me!
I've just lost my Iron Fan!

Don't worry, Mama

I have a present for you

Look, Mama!

My Iron Fan!
How did you...?

Monkey isn't the only one
with tricks up his sleeve!

Ow, that hurts!

You lazy hog! Roast pork!

Wake up!

Master, look at Brother Monkey!

He's picking on me

Don't you get it?

Before a long journey, you need rest!

You're just lazy!

That's a bad excuse!

No...

Stop hitting me!

Don't run away!
Stop hitting me!

Shut up!

But my face is my fortune!

Shut up!
Stop hitting me!

Monkey, don't bully Pigsy

What?

I risk my life getting hold
of that stupid Iron F an...

...while he just dozes in the sun!

Why are you siding with him, Master?

I don't want trouble

I just need a helping hand
once in a while

If we don't find a way
to cross these mountains...

...our journey's over

Don't go around blaming people!
Master has done nothing wrong

If not for him, where would we be?

Don't just fly off the handle!
If you have to blame someone, blame me!

Don't blame Master!

One more squeal from you...

...and we'll see who wants roast pork
for dinner

Master! He wants to roast me!

Namo Amitabha...

Ow!!! Master, I can't take it!!!



You had this coming!
Serves you right for being so mean!

Master!

You shut up! Better watch what you say!

Don't expect me to come running...

...next time you're in a fix!

Who asked you to?

It's killing me, Master!
I'll be good, I promise!

Master, please end the spell

Holy men should be kind and merciful!

That's what you always tell us!

I'll stop as long as
you promise to keep your temper

I promise!
I'll never lose my temper again!

I'm truly sorry, Master

Good!
You must correct your behaviour

Remember, your heart should always
overflow with kindness

Brother...

My heart will overflow with kindness,
but I need my stomach full too

Pigsy, Monkey had a point

You should make yourself useful

How far can you go
on an empty stomach?

And you need rest
to prepare for a long journey

Banana oil!

Master...

I know what's on your mind

And I know
what you've done for all of us

We're lucky to have you with us

I have a bad temper,
I let you down

Just remember, try to be patient

Master, I will

Are you laughing at me, too?

You think I'm just a bag of pork chops?

That I can't make any plans?

What are you staring at?

Come closer if you like!

Roast Pork has his pride too

If you don't shup up,
I'll get you...

...and grill you for dinner!

Just look at you!

Not exactly a model citizen, are you?

Coward, you should be afraid of me

You're lucky I missed!

But I've got
more important things to think about

I'll deal with you when I get back

Y eah! Go!

What bad luck!

That was just the warm-up

Now for the real show!

No?

You don't believe me?

I'll let you see

This is my super armored cricket!

He's in a class of his own!

He's literally unbeatable!

Ox, I think you should just give up

Just you wait,
I'm going to turn the tables

I've lost almost everything I own!

Sorry to hear that...
I'll make you an offer

Don't ever say
I didn't give you a chance

If you win this game...

...you can recoup all of your losses.

Fine! Just watch me go!

Watch you go? Okay!

But if you lose again...

...what will I get?

My trusty steed!

My Blue-water-golden-eye will be yours!

I don't think so,
I don't have a driving license

So I think you'd better stake
something else instead

Let's see, how about
betting your wife's Iron Fan?

Everyone wants the Iron Fan
all of a sudden!

Sorry, it's her family heirloom

I can't stake that

No deal, no game!

All right, all right, it's a deal

I'll stake the Iron Fan

Little champ,
I've staked everything on you!

My life depends on you!

Seconds out... fight!

Y eah! You've got him!

Go for it! Go!

Half-time!

Come on, buddy! You gotta win for me!

Hey, that's cheating!
You're doping him! Cheat!

Cheat! Cheat!

Okay, now I'm angry!

A bull in a china shop
has nothing on me right now!

Don't run away...

...or I'll knock the whole place down

Don't get so excited!

Here, let your champ have some too!

Oh no!

My poor little buddy!

I should smash you like a bug!

Not so fast! I've arranged
for your precious Princess...

...to take this potion too

You'd better act fast!

Bring me the Iron F an
within four hours...

...and I'll give you the antidote

Otherwise you can
bury the Iron Fan with your wife!

That slimy, double-crossing toad!

Double-crossing? Don't insult me!

Hey, watch who you push aside!

You should say "Sorry"
when you bump into someone

I could die laughing!

A fat pig complaining to a big ox!

How do you do?

I am the famous Pigsy

Hey, fat pig...

This is a clip joint!
You should steer clear of it!

Don't worry, Ox

I know you always lose

I'm here to win for you

To win for me?

That's odd, how does he know my name?

Anyhow, I must hurry home

Welcome, Pigsy!

Have a seat, good sir!

Plenty of pretty girls here!

I'd like to see your manager

Now the Iron F an
is all but in our hands!

Why has this pig shown up?

Never mind,
he's signing his own death warrant

Through him
we'll get the monk's ground bones!

We'll live forever!

But what about
that interfering little ape?

Monkey?

I have a plan to deal with him

Delicious dishes,
and the rice is good too...

Do you have a vegetarian menu?

Y es, we do

Then next time I'll bring my Master

Ow, something hit me!

Who turned out the lights?
It's suddenly gone dark...

Money, focus your mind!
Calm mind, calm body!

Master, bad news!

Shh! "Calm mind, calm body"

Don't you get it?
What's the problem?

Pigsy's gone missing!

Really?

Roast Pork can't have gone too far!
Let's split up and search for him

Okay

Pigsy! Pigsy!

Watermelon! Watermelon!
Sweet, juicy watermelon!

Come on, have a slice!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Come on!

Try a slice! Help yourself!

But I don't have any money

Never mind, have one on me

Thank you! Don't mind if I do

T ake your time, enjoy!

There's plenty more

Have you...

...by any chance...
seen a fat...

...with a podgy nose...

A pig? Carrying a rake, right?

That's the one?

Y eah, he had some watermelon
and went that way!

Sandy, stop!
I know this creep!

He's up to no good!

That watermelon must be poisoned!

Now, tell me the truth!
Where did that juicy porker...

...I mean, Pigsy...
Where did he go?

Murder! Murder!

Help!
Stop it!

Monkey, stop it!

They didn't pay for the watermelon,
and now they're attacking me!

Master, that toad is lying!

I didn't touch him!

Silence!
I saw the whole thing

Good sir...

Good sir, are you hurt?

I'm so sorry

This is all my fault,
I haven't taught them well enough

Master, Monkey didn't hit him

You're getting it wrong

Be quiet!

I didn't do anything!

I didn't! I'm innocent!

You're incorrigible!

Apologise at once!

I'm innocent...

Go away, you disobedient delinquent!

Hurry up and go!

Don't worry, I won't use the spell

Just go as far away as possible!
I don't want you to be with me

Monkey, apologize to Master!

Please do it!

No way! I've wanted to quit for ages!

Have it your own way, monk!

Go on your quest without me

I'll go back to my mountain

Let him go

Just ignore himself

Monkey...

Please don't be angry, sir!
It was really all my fault

I know where your pig friend went

Just head down this path...

Turn at the next corner,
and you'll find him there

You go ahead,
I'll just clean up this mess here

I'll catch up with you

That's very kind of you!
Many thanks!

Master! Save me!

You wicked spiders!
Release Brother Pigsy right now!

Master! Save me!

You've arrived just in time

All divisions, advance! Seize them!

Princess! Where are you?

Princess! Where are you?

Princess! Where are you?

Wula! Princess!
What's happened to you?

Buck up, Princess!

We're running out of time!

The Fan! Princess, I need the Iron Fan!

Otherwise you'll die
when the sand runs out!

Come on, Baby, we have no time to waste

The Iron Fan... is right...

Come on, Honey, don't nod out!

Honey, wake up!

Where's the Iron Fan?

Where? On her head?

Could it be her hairpin?

So that's where she hides it!

Wula, watch your mistresscarefully

I've got to get the antidote

Hang on, what about the magic spell?

W ake up, Princess!

What shall I do?

Great, Wula! You've been a big help!

Thanks a lot!

I gotta hurry to get the antidote

Who is it?

Who?

Me, of course

Uh... it's you

Monkeyboy,
what's that "Uh"supposed to mean?

I'm in no mood to play with you, kid

What?

You've forgotten our agreement?

No, but I'm not in the mood now

I'm not part of the quest
for the sacred scroll any more

What? Are you breaking your word?

I won't let you!

It's time to settle our differences
once and for all!

Look, kid, I'm not in the mood!
Don't you get it?

Hold it right there! You don't go
anywhere until we've fought!

Fine! You want a fight,
I'll give you a fight!

This is a big day!

Now everything is in your power,
Mistress!

How does it feel to be in control?

You have the Iron F an and the monk

Please don't forget our agreement...
the jewels you promised me

Your help has been invaluable, T oad,
I should thank you

How could I forget
all you've done for me?

But...

How do I know that
this is the real Iron Fan?

What are you doing, Mistress?

Hey... Be careful with it!

I just want to test...

...the power of the Iron Fan

Mistress! Please! Spare me!

Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

Help! Help me!

A red shoe?

That traitor was wearing those shoes

So it was you!
You're the traitor!

Don't kill me, young master!
They've taken your mother's Iron Fan

Your father and the monk are in danger!

Monkeyboy, we have to rescue them!

It could be a trap

Believe me, it's all true!

Trust me this once!

Spider just used the Iron F an
to blow me away!

Okay, I'll trust you this time

But if it turns out you're lying,
we'll eat frog's legs tonight

Now, get lost!

Ow, my back!

Young master!

Your mother has been poisoned,
but I have the antidote here

Come back!

Ow! Why has it turned out like this?

I guess I deserve it

Hey, where are we going? Help!
I'm afraid of heights!

Master, I don't want to be roasted!

Dad!

Look out, son!

You think you can strike us alone?

Archers, deploy webs!

Princess, I've brought you the antidote

Son! Rush home and help your mother!

Monkey, help me!

Forget it! You're not getting away!

You stinking spider, let me go!

So you want to die?
You're the one who's gonna die!

Monkey!

Thanks

Master, that was a close thing!

Monkey, you came just in time

Curse you!

Red, my son! This is all my fault!

Thank heaven you're safe!

Dad, let's celebrate another time

Oh! The Iron Fan!

My Iron Fan!

I'm so glad to see you, my dear,
dear, dearest buddy!

This is no time to get sentimental!

I'm sorry for doubting you, Monkey

Pigsy, go and help Horse!

She still has the Iron F an!
What shall we do?

You won't know what hits you!

Retreat!

It's a trap! Spread out!

Fire spiders!

If they put out the fires
on Mount Flame, we'll have no home!

T ake up your weapons and prepare
to fight for your lives!

Spider queendom rules the world!

Spider queendom rules the world!

Spider queendom rules the world!

You asked for it!

Master, stay clear!

Okay, clone disciples, fight!

Shrink!

We'll help you!

Dragon! Dragon! Dragon!

Fetch! Bring me the Iron F an!

Ugh!

Next time, watch where you're going!

Why don't you keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut?

Let's go!

Dragon! Don't give her the Iron Fan!

Dragon! Don't give her the Iron Fan!

Give it to me!
Give it to me!

Give it to me!
Give it to me!

Give it to me!
Give it to me!

Give it to me!
Give it to me!

Oh dear!

I'm so sorry!

Did that hurt?

Stop bucking around!

Stop bucking around!

That's it!

Go, go!

Hey, you ugly bug!

If you hurt him,
I'll cut you into pieces!

Don't bite off
more than you can chew, brat!

Come on, hurry!

They sound busy in there!
Maybe we should come back later...

Darling, wait for me!

Can I believe my eyes?

I'm fully recovered!

It's a miracle

I've been so blind!

I'll never gamble again

This is no time to get sentimental!

Where's our son?

There they are, up there!

Over here! The blanket's ready!

We have to save my Dragon!
You got it!

Thank you for my Iron F an

What's wrong with him?

He's choking on the pearl!
We have to help him

The pearl!

We did it!

You're the best little dragon
in the world!

Dragon! My sweet little Dragon!

You're the best little dragon
in the world!

What terrible disasters...

...Mount Flame has caused

Please take cover, all of you

I'll do something about it

The Iron Fan is precious only
when it's used in the right way

What's wrong, my dearest?
Mama!

I'll be fine

I'm just a little tired

Amitabha! Buddha be praised!

What you have done for us all...

...is truly beyond any words of thanks

Now that the fire is out...

...we must say farewell and
continue our quest for the sacred scroll

You have to leave right now?

Hey, kid! Stay cool!

I'll see you again
when we've finished the quest

Ox, my old friend...

Like father, like son

You have an amazing boy!

Till we meet again! Goodbye!

A gift for you

Monkey...

What's wrong now, boss?

I think...

I think it's about time
we took off this ring

Too much!

Master, are you sure about that?

What if Monkey tries to
tenderize me again?

Pigsy, you worry too much

But Master...

Last time he hit my head with his staff

He said my head was like a wooden fish!

Master, Master...

I think I'm kind of used to wearing it

I won't look so cool without it

An idol like me needs to look cool!

I can wait for the sequel
to take it off! Thanks anyway!

Amitabha!

Amitabha! So be it!

Hey, Monkeyboy!

After your quest...

...don't forget to come visit me!

Sure, no problem!

Count on it! Bye bye!

It's a deal!

Deal!

Bye bye! Bye bye!

Come on, Sandy

Oh...

It's a butterfly!
