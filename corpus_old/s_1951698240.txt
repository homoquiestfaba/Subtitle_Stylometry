Dana?

Dana, can you hear me?

Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

No, no, "N"!

Harold.

It's very becoming. I like that.

Guys, there's nothing
I can do, all right?

The meeting's gonna be canceled.

The building's being evacuated.

Top four floors are closed off.
I don't know what's going on.

It doesn't matter.
Nobody's supposed to be there.

Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

Clifford, it's 2:37
and my interns are stranded.

Where the fuck is he?
He's coming.

He's coming?
He's coming.

I think we got something.

Oh, my God. Is that him?

South side of the building.
Do you see it?

That's him! He's here!
Oh, my God!

He's landing! Clear the roof!

Get your things. Go! Come on!
Quickly.

He keeps his promises.

Fake.

Fake.
Yes.

Malika, Clifford is the man
who wrote Fake.

An excellent book
about the guy, artist...

I'm blanking... Who was it?

Art forger.
The art forger.

Exactly. Elmyr de Hory was his name.
Okay.

He forged Picassos, Matisses,
Modiglianis...

The whole theory of forgery as art.
What is art?

Very subversive kind of act.

The book sold poorly.

Well, it could've done better.
Let's not talk about that today.

Regardless. The new one. Fiction.

Yes.
Rudnick's Problem.

I like it. You're right.

I like it. Malika liked it, too.
Yeah.

Yes, I did. I loved it. It was stunning.

It scared the hell out of me, actually,
to tell you the truth.

It's an angry book.
But funny!

I mean, I read it,
I thought it was hilarious.

It wasn't angry to me.

It was nice to me. It made me laugh.

But anger's important. We need anger.

Which I think will help us in Germany.

Regardless,
marry us and have our children?

Brad Silber at Life is reading it
right now for serialization rights.

Great.

Harold McGraw himself
is reading it this weekend.

You're kidding.
That's just a formality.

You have waited, Cliff.

You've watched as less talented writers
have bypassed you.

But now, justice at last.

They're going to push this one hard.
They're going to bet the bank.

Is that a promise?
You can set your watch by it.

Andrea, I don't have a watch.

Then buy one.
Trust me, you can afford it.

Calls unreturned, they don't read you

for six months, they're indifferent.

Then overnight... God.
Dick, can you hear me?

Dick! Here, try these. They're bigger.

No, they're fine.

We're doing a vacation,
a gentleman's celebration kind of thing.

You got harpoons?
The ones that shoot?

Yeah, most of them shoot.
Good.

He looks like a sausage.
All right, I'll take the whole outfit.

Set me up as a regular account.
I prefer monthly payments.

You're a prick, Robert, you are such
a prick. You played me like a harp.

Whitewalls, leather...
Is this guy a salesman?

Now, when my accountant comes by
with the check,

should he talk to you directly?

He should speak to me directly, yeah,
with the check, yeah.

Call the police, there's a
beautiful woman in front of my house!

What's the matter, pear?

You haven't seen
a bestselling author before?

Oh, Cliff.
Yes.

You didn't think I was going to do it,
did you?

Stop, Cliff, stop.
Look, they're taking the sofa.

Oh, I love that sofa.

Hey, guys. How are you doing?

Ah, fuck the sofa.

Close your eyes. Close, close.
What?

Okay.
Oh, Cliff.

Cliff!

There, perfect.
You are a beautiful man.

I am sure you would desert me.

No, will desert you,
the tense is future active.

Don't correct the grammar of it.
You are not this perfect person.

Honey, it's finished.
I told you it was finished.

It's finished with her.

Good night.
Cliff...

Keys to my new car.
Yeah, got it. Bye, honey.

Have fun.

Andrea!

Andrea! Hi, isn't this amazing?
Isn't this wild?

Can I talk to you a second?
Let's talk on Monday, Cliff.

No, just for a second.
It's really important. I'd like to...

Look, 30,000 copies is not gonna do it.

A short run like that,
it sends out a message,

and it's not a good one.

We're not publishing the book.
Exactly, exactly.

With 30,000 copies, it's like
we're not really publishing the book...

Brad Silber at Life magazine hated it.
He called it,

"A third-rate Philip Roth knock-off."
And he told Harold. And it was awful.

It just rolled like a snowball.

I wanted to tell you on Monday.
I'm sorry.

Fine, we'll do The New Yorker.
The New Yorker's better anyway...

You're not listening to me, Cliff.

McGraw-Hill is not publishing
your book.

Book, gone. The bomb has dropped.

It's over.

Andrea, you said
that this was a formality.

Well, apparently, I was mistaken.

Look, if you have other ideas,
my door is always open to you.

The enemy, very deceitfully,

has taken advantage of the troops...

They are potatoes, all of them.
Potato people.

And you are a brilliant, strong man
who will have all his dreams.

All of them.

You know what I'm getting
for dinner? Swordfish steak.

It sounds good. Sounds enticing.

Oh, come on, Cliff. Forget it, forget it.

All right. Enough, enough.

I want to talk about my friend.

Tell me about the children's book
you're working on.

Oh, Richard the Lionhearted.
That's going okay.

I should be done
by the end of the year.

You know, it's a great subject.
War, sodomy.

I mean, the war part's great.
Kids love war.

But what do you do with the sodomy?
You know?

You see, I want it to be
historically accurate.

And you will make it so
because you are a superb researcher,

and a fine writer.

Thank you.

Bumped by this adolescent coffee boy.

My lit professor at Cornell
compared me to Hemingway.

The middle of my life is at hand.
I don't have a couch.

Think about this.

Henry Miller was 38 years old,
unpublished.

His wife left him for a lesbian.

You're kind to tell me that, Dick.

You're a very good man.
You're a good friend.

Need a loan?
Always.

No, no. I was kidding, Cliff.
You got a pen, kid?

I was kidding.
Your house is going into foreclosure.

I'm post-dating it.
Stop that. Stop being the hero.

Go to bed.
I got it, I got it. Walk away. Go.

I got it.
All right.

Go to bed.
I will.

Everyone's being relocated
to another hotel.

Please stay calm and follow me.

Excuse me. Can you...
Follow me, please!

Somebody told me
that Howard Hughes is

moving into this hotel.

What is this? What's going on?

It's an executive decision
to close the facility for the weekend, sir.

You're being relocated.
Executive decision?

Howard Hughes
wants the pool to himself,

so he's kicking everyone out
at 1:00 a.m.?

I don't know about that, sir.

That's power.

It's a friendship
between Tom Mix and Pancho Villa.

Revolution, Mexican revolution.

Men were men.

Friendship and...
Mr. Clifford?

Andrea's running late, so she said
that we should just go ahead

and start the meeting without her.

"Mr. Clifford"? Wait a minute.

I'm meeting with you?

Oh, no. Excuse me.

Mr. Clifford...

Excuse me!
Hello, I'm sorry, everybody. Andrea...

I'm sorry. I did tell him, but...

Cliff, I'm in the middle
of a conference meeting.

Andrea, our personal history demands
that I bring this to you first.

Bring what?

I'm working on the most important book
of the 20th century.

It's unprecedented.
I'm gonna discuss it tomorrow.

I'm gonna present the details
about it tomorrow.

Okay.
Morning, 9:00 a.m.

Thank you.
At Nathan's Bowling Alley in Queens.

Did I ever take you there before?
Sir?

Okay, yeah, I'm going, I'm going.

You'd better be sure, Andrea,
that I don't have anything,

'cause Simon and Schuster is coming.

"Of the century"? Couldn't you
have just said "of the decade"?

All right, all right.

And why a bowling alley?
Please, make a contribution here.

Just open your mind.
The first thing that comes to your mind.

Potato famine.
Too Irish.

A history of agriculture.
Oh, that's a bestseller.

Shedding new light on World War I.
What's the new light?

Write about Picasso.
Everyone loves Picasso.

I don't.
Charlemagne?

Too French.
History of the Vatican.

I'm dying.
Give me a clue here.

I'm being self-destructive.
I gotta call Barbara.

I'm burning bridges, Edith.

They never appreciated you there.

I need lunch.

I'm having a breakdown.

My gallery show's in three weeks.
I know.

I don't have time
for the drama now, darling.

Shit.

Dick!

Size 7.

How?

No one knows where he is.
I show up, I've seen him.

I've seen the snowman.

I send him my de Hory book.

He reads it.

It's a positive portrayal
of a very complex man.

Oh, my God, I get a response.

Correspondence. Sparks fly.
Personal connection.

We become best of friends.
What do you think?

What is it? What's the book?
Wait, wait.

Where's Simon and Schuster, Tolstoy?

This is the key to it.

Have a strong, continuous line,
keep the pen on the paper.

Just like that.

All these articles say the same thing.

Hughes runs
a billion-dollar network of companies,

but he only communicates
with handwritten memos.

He doesn't even talk to his top guys.
There's no direct contact anywhere.

That's why it's gonna work.

Fine. Tell me my dick grew
five inches last night.

I'll still use a ruler.

Howard Hughes?
Howard Hughes, the billionaire?

His exclusive,
authorized autobiography.

He wants Cliff to write it with him.

And they want us to publish it.

Handwriting analysis? Right away.
Can we bring it over right now?

"It would not suit me to die without
having stated the truth about my life."

"My life."

"I therefore authorize Clifford Irving
to act as intermediary

"as to any arrangements regarding
the publishing of my memoir."

"It would not suit me to die

"without having
certain misconceptions cleared up

"and without having stated
the truth about my life."

So,

taking you at your word...

Yeah.

How does Mr. Hughes propose
we proceed?

I...

Look, this is all very strange.

I'm just getting
the lay of the land here myself.

But what...

What I can gather so far
is that he refuses to go outdoors.

He will only initiate,
never accept, phone calls.

Those two particular rumors
seem to be true.

But he did say that he would provide

handwritten contracts
for legal purposes.

And... Whatever questions you...

You know, you give them to me,

I'll pass them on
when he makes contact with me.

But beyond that,
I don't know what to say, really.

Why you, Cliff?

He could have any writer in the world
do this for him.

Albert, I have absolutely no idea.

This is the strangest thing
that has ever happened to me.

Best guess, he likes me.

So, the matching against the reprinted
letters from Newsweek magazine,

Osborn Associates' preliminary opinion

is that the handwriting samples
are genuine.

Okay, well, all right...
Excuse me one second.

Yeah, sure.

Yeah?

Clifford?
Yeah?

Did you and Howard discuss
how much you both wanted?

Because we would like
to make you an offer today.

We did. We did. We...

We did discuss it.

Can I weigh in here?
No.

A man walks in, he says something
completely implausible,

and for that exact reason,
he is believed.

No, it's an Aquarian phenomenon.

Very, very spiritual.
Lawyers are not spiritual.

Presumably, this is gonna make news.

Howard Hughes hasn't spoken
to the press in 15 years.

What are you so nervous about?

You can't think, Dick. No thinking.
All I'm saying is, once this gets out,

what's gonna stop this guy
from suing our asses off?

Three words. TWA shareholder lawsuit.

Howard has a judgment of
137 million bucks waiting to hit him

if he walks into any courtroom.

So the book comes out,
it doesn't matter. He can't sue.

He can still say it's a fake.

He doesn't say anything
about anything. This guy...

He uses ripped-up Kleenex boxes
for slippers and he drinks his own piss.

He's psychotic.
Have you heard of Intertel?

He has his own private CIA.
Ruthless advisors.

His advisors don't know anything
about the book

because he's too paranoid to tell them.

And he'll never come out of hiding
long enough to denounce me

because he's a lunatic hermit.

And I am the spokesperson
for the lunatic hermit.

So the more outrageous I sound,
the more convincing I am.

Do you believe this, the perfection?

They offered half a million.
Half a million dollars?

Four-hundred grand for Howard
and a hundred grand for us!

Oh, I thought you meant
just a half a million for us.

Schmuck, it's all for us.
There is no Howard Hughes.

Dick, are you paying attention to me?
Yeah.

The problem is this.

It's an oral agreement.

Their lawyers are gonna
jump all over this,

which is why
we have to leave right now.

We gotta become experts
on this man's life.

And if we find dirt and it rings true,
the top guys will shove this deal

right down the lawyers' throats.

Cliff,

no visits with special friends, right?

I'm not going to do anything
to jeopardize what we've rebuilt, okay?

You just said to warn you
when you get excited.

You seem excited.
Well...

I love you.

I love you.

Cliff, Howard Hughes' testimony

at the Senate committee hearings
in 1947.

It's got his speech patterns,
his syntax, everything. It's perfect.

Take a picture.

You can't photograph
a government document, it's a felony.

You gonna memorize it?
Take a picture. Take a picture.

I'm a researcher, Cliff.
I am not a jewel thief.

You own 25 percent of this book.

You want it to be good?
You take a picture.

You know, I've always had
a dangerous side.

Barbara has often remarked on it.

But to take down the Library
of Congress. God, the adrenaline.

You took a nice picture
of your leg here.

Or is that your ankle? I can't tell.
Where?

Right there.

It's my ankle.
It's all out of focus anyway.

Jesus.
Want another drink?

Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.

Oh, fuck.

Harold, this book will sell more copies
than the Bible.

And our competitors will kill to get it,
and if they can't get it,

they will do anything they can
to destroy it.

I say we sign this contract immediately,
and institute absolute, total secrecy.

Total. Not even wives can know.

Within reason.

From now on,
we refer to Hughes as "Octavio."

The book is called "Project Octavio."

Get Ralph Graves on the phone.

That's the code name.

I want our journalist friends
to weigh in on this

before I sign
Mr. Hughes' piece of paper.

Look at all this security personnel.

This is a secure facility.

We need the information
in portable form.

Just look comfortable, be buoyant.

Hell, they can let anybody in here.

What if I'm a Russian?
Be a buoyant Russian.

Records? What for?

You don't know what the hell's going on
with your own company?

Well, to be honest with you, Sergeant,
no, actually, we don't.

Mr. Hughes doesn't like
to share information.

It's very frustrating for us.

You want frustration?

Call Hughes Aircraft and try to find out
when your plane's gonna be ready.

I've seen decorated individuals
sobbing like six-year-old girls

after dealing with you people.

Could my associate
use your facilities, Sergeant?

Could he?

Thank you for that.
To your left.

I'll level with you.
We've had some problems.

Everyone has told us stories
about delays.

Well, I can't get anybody on the phone,
for one thing.

I had no idea it was this serious.
It's very serious.

Frustrating.
Can you go into any more detail?

Well, the only details I can tell you

is that I've been on the phone
three times today to one girl,

who doesn't know
what she's talking about,

can't tell me when
I'm gonna get my airplanes.

Which office were you talking to?
Do you mind if I write something down?

Sure.
This was the complaint department?

No, acquisitions.
Acquisitions?

Acquisitions, as far as I know.

My people been dealing with her,
or somebody down there,

for the last three months,
trying to get two aircrafts.

This is an outrage.

An outrage,
the military should be treated that way.

No. No. I'm not doing it.

Hi.

Thank you.

Hey, Dick. You all right?
Yeah.

Okay. Keep moving, keep moving.

Just fine, just fine.
It's palpitations.

It's okay. A little bit more,
a little bit more. Keep moving.

Sit down here. That's good.

You all right?

You're fine. You're fine.

Fight or flight. It's an animal thing.

It's like you're being chased
by a cheetah or something.

Okay, okay. I'll be fine.

You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

Look, Noah Dietrich, on the right.

Howard Hughes' right-hand man
for over 30 years.

Retired to Vegas.
The other guy, I don't know.

Vegas?

You know, my guess is this guy,
Dietrich, is going to be really cagey.

Information?
Las Vegas, Nevada, please.

Hello?
Mr. Dietrich?

Yeah?
Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you at home.

My name is Clifford Irving
and I'm writing a book

about the history of aviation.

I'd be really grateful if you'd share
some of your expertise with me.

Oh, great. Come on over.

You like geranium tea?

It helps your bowels. Follow me.

Watch your step.

Hey, you're a writer.
Yes, I am.

I should show you something.

This is an account
of my years at Tool Co.

You know Tool Co.?
Howard Hughes' company.

Has anyone seen this?

Nobody's seen it. It's sensitive.

Listen, I'll come right to the point.

I'll give you $500
to clean up the grammar,

'cause I'm bad with spelling.

Yeah, well, I'd have to read it first.
When can I get it back to you?

No, no, no,
I can't let it out of the house.

Why don't you read it right now,
sitting here?

Now?
Now.

Right here? Okay.

Take your time. See you later.
Thank you.

You know what this is?
Do you understand what this means?

This is exactly... It's gold.
It's perfect.

We have to find a way
to get it out of the house.

Copy, we need a copy.

Okay, get up. Stand in front of me.
Come over here.

It's great in the water!
Keep smiling. What's he doing?

Oh, yeah.
Tell me if he can see it.

Grab it.

Tell your friend to come in.
The water's beautiful.

Copy that and get back here,
right away.

Thank you!

Sit down, sit down. Thank you.

All right? Are you ready?

All right. I'm done.

Sir, honesty is my policy.

This is atrocious. It's not publishable.

It's run-on sentences,
it's mangled verbiage...

I'm very sorry.

This is badly spelled gossip
from someone absolutely in the know.

This is perfect. Perfect! Oh, my...

You know what we should
do? Let's give Andrea some good news.

This is amazing.
Everybody hates Howard Hughes.

They call him cheap, everything else.

But, you know, they're in his thrall.
They can't stop talking about him.

He's Howard Hughes.
Who the fuck are they?

Listen. "He rarely took vacations.

"But when he did,
he usually booked a remote hotel

"in the Juchitan mountains
called the Salina Cruz."

Remote. R-E-M-O-A-T. Vacation...
I'm going for a walk.

I'll be back in a little bit.
Okay.

What is it?

Look, you told me
not to call you ever again, so I didn't.

I say a lot of stupid things, you know?
Yeah.

It was funny seeing you the other night.

I would have given anything
to get this call a year ago.

It's too late. I...
Clifford...

You ran out of time. Sorry.
Clifford, wait. I need to see you.

Bye.

Cliff, listen to this.
This is from the Dietrich manuscript.

There's a full transcription here of a
conversation between Howard Hughes

and Frank McCullough
from Time magazine.

They mention Intertel, the Mormon guy,
George Gordon Holmes.

It's fantastic.
Stop, listen to me.

Nina called from New York last night.
Oh, here we go.

Dick, it took me a year
to make things right with Edith.

Keep an eye on me, will you?
Keep an eye?

It's my second profession.

Here you are.
Thanks.

Cliff...

I've been talking to Barbara,

and she's found some kind of
publishing contract.

And I was wondering
if maybe we could talk about,

you know, some kind of credit deal,

or just some more money for me.

You're not happy
with what we talked about?

No, no, no, it's not that.
What? What is it?

Well, it's just like...
I sort of feel that, you know...

Don't answer that! Don't...

Hello, darling. It's Ms. Tate calling.
We have a bit of a problem.

Andrea thinks it's just me...
Hello! Hi, Andrea, this...

Who is this?
You can't say her name.

This is Dick.
No, no, don't give your name.

Dick Suskind.

Dick, how do you know my name?

Don't tell her!
Cliff mentioned you.

What are you doing out there
with Clifford?

I am the...
Co-coordinator of...

I'm the coauthor of Project Octavio.
Excuse me?

Is Cliff there?
Yes, certainly. He's right here.

Put him on the phone, please.
I didn't know what else to say.

I heard you talking...
I know what you're doing.

I know what you're doing.
What?

I know what you're doing.

Hi, Andrea.

Who the hell was that, Clifford?

That is my associate.

I was intending
to talk to you about him.

He's working with me on this.

All right. You need to be in New York
at 9:00 on Monday morning.

You're meeting with Ralph Graves.

He's the editor-in-chief
of Life magazine.

Yeah, I know who he is.

You need to go over all your contacts
with Octavio.

Life knows a lot about him, so get
your memory clear and be specific.

I don't want to lose the deal
over their knee-jerk suspicions.

What do you... Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean, "lose the deal"?

What suspicions?

Just tell them the truth.

He gave me a prune.
He gave me a prune.

Visualize the Mediterranean
or something.

You're sweating like an animal.

You know, it's pretty nervy
of these publishers

to put us through this inquisition.

Well, you can't sit it out now.
You're a coauthor.

History.

Quite a responsibility.

The second handwriting analysis
told us

your letters from Mr. Hughes
are authentic.

100 percent.
No surprise there.

Experts want to provide their employers
with good news.

He gave me a prune.

What?

Right... In a bag.

He gave me a prune. Howard Hughes.

Dick is jumping forward a little bit.
It was a memorable moment for him.

Anyway, Ralph, how can we help?
You know, no one likes to be accused.

I really don't think anyone's
making accusations here, Dick.

Are we going to stand around all day
looking at photographs?

We came here to talk about
Howard Hughes. Let's talk about him.

He gave me a prune.

Howard Hughes gave me a prune
on the beach at Nassau.

I thought you met Hughes
the first time in Mexico.

Ralph, what happened was this.
I got a phone call.

Really, out of the blue.

From a man
named George Gordon Holmes.

Longtime associate of Howard Hughes.

He says he wants us
to fly down to Mexico City,

wait for a call,
so we go ahead and do this.

We fly down there,
we check into this fleabag hotel.

Eighteen hours we wait,
no air conditioning,

sand crabs in the bathtub,
I say, "The hell with him,"

when we spot an envelope,

shoved under the door.

He rarely went on vacation,
but when he did,

he usually booked into a remote hotel

in the mountains of Juchitan.
It says,

"There's a pilot waiting
to take you to Juchitan."

So it's 6:00 a.m.,
we're flying low over the mountains,

and I'm nervous.

But he's got a touch, this bush pilot.

He brings it right down
onto a gray pebble landing strip.

Just as it comes down,
I see out of the corner of my eye,

there's a jeep that's coming down
from the mountains.

Mexican military?

No.

It's Holmes.

Mr. Irving?
Yes, that's right. Mr. Holmes?

Who is this?
Dick Suskind, sir.

So, he's a little surprised to see Dick,

but I explained that Dick
was my researcher and friend,

and that's why he was there
and I couldn't do without him.

We get in the jeep,

and he takes us on this endless ride,
up through the mountains.

We circled around the top of this hill
and we got to the hotel,

which was called

Salina Cruz.

Holmes motions for us to follow.

It's quiet.

There's a room
way in the back, like a hut.

Doesn't even have
a view of the ocean.

We can barely see.

There's a little slip of a man on a bed,
sitting like a monk.

Howard Hughes.

Howard Hughes.

Howard Hughes is sitting right there.

My heart...

And then he was reaching out
through the mosquito netting,

and he offered Dick a...

A prune.

A prune.

Dick takes the prune,

eats the prune...

Not bad.

And he started talking about
the extraordinary value of Mexican soil,

organic farming, organic food,
et cetera, et cetera.

The two of them started jabbering
like old friends.

We ended up talking a little bit about
business, then Dick and I went home.

I'm a little hungry.
Let's eat.

Ralph, will you pick
something fabulous?

The Latour please, '61.

That'll get us started. Thank you.
Oh, yes.

And some beluga,
shall we, gentlemen?

Sounds good.

You know, Howard Hughes
doesn't like caviar.

Really?

Really. In fact, he made a special point
of saying so.

I remember that. I...

It was such a non sequitur.
It was a strange thing.

It was just after Clifford
finished talking about the...

The crash.
That's right. The crash.

The one in Beverly Hills.
He nearly hit the top of that house,

parked it right on top of the house, hurt
his back, but he walked away from it.

And he said that people
in Beverly Hills eat caviar,

and he doesn't like it
and then he crashed his plane.

Okay, then let's make it
two beluga appetizers, please.

Three maybe.
Three, yeah. Make it three.

Andrea, yeah?
Thank you. Okay. Good.

Did you get any sense
of his business acumen?

Go ahead.

It's interesting. He said that...

Very interesting. He said that people
often think of business as business,

which of course it is, but also...
Within business, there is also pleasure.

You know, business is pleasure.
Pleasure can be a business.

Business has pleasure.
It's both. It's both at the same time.

I didn't really understand it,
but after a while it sunk in,

and I realized, you know,
that's his genius.

This is your check for writing services.

The second check for Mr. Hughes,
or, Octavio, sorry...

It's gonna take
a little longer to process.

I understand you're authorized
to receive Mr. Hughes' payment?

Yeah, I am, I am, thank you.
But don't take too long, all right?

Life magazine is prepared
to offer $250,000

for worldwide exclusive rights
to serialize the Howard Hughes story.

That's a record, Harold.

I'm wondering if it's enough of a record,
Ralph.

Oh, jeez.
The money makes this real.

You can still back out,
but you gotta tell me now.

Back out?
Yeah.

Fuck, no!
We're the goddamn Musketeers.

Good. That's good.
Don't spend any money, though.

Better we keep it for later,
in case we need it.

Absolutely.

In other news,
the Supreme Court has agreed to hear

the TWA shareholders' case against
reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.

A loss could cost Hughes
$137,000,000

and devastate his financial empire.

The Nixon Justice Department
has thus far refused...

We gotta reach big.

We'll go for texture, gritty details,
we need blood, we need money,

we need real juicy,
Shakespearean, big stuff...

You want to critique a sitting president
who's also a war criminal?

No, no, no.
You can do anything you want.

You can impact culture
with something like this.

"Impact culture." I want to make
some money and not get caught.

You know,
we've got to make this plausible.

Dick, I handed them
three yellow letters.

They gave me $500,000.
Is that plausible?

I don't think so.

You want to get a drink?
Okay.

I'm gonna change my shirt.
I'll be right out.

I'm heading home.
You go. I'm sticking for a while.

See you, Tom.
Good night.

Tommy, can I use your phone?
Yeah, sure, go right ahead.

I saw Elmyr a few months ago in Ibiza.

So, how is our old friend Elmyr?

Well, I was having dinner with friends,

and he was at the bar,
sitting all alone, drinking.

He came up to me and he said,

"I have always found your affair with
Clifford to be common and immoral."

And he stormed out.

You're lying. Elmyr didn't say that.

Oh, I'm the liar?

And who's writing a fake book about
the most famous man in the world?

Gotta get back.

No! No, the clock is broken. You stay.

Just to confirm,

he's still rich
and you're still not gonna leave him.

Oh, I want to, Cliff, I want to.

But, no, I'm not going to.

I'm shallow, Cliff.

My greatest desire
is to be an American movie star.

How shallow is that?
Pretty shallow.

And besides, why does it bother you
so much that I'm your mistress?

Brecht, Hemingway,
they all had mistresses.

The lying gives me a headache,
if you want to know the truth.

Oh, I forgot. You're a devoted husband.

I think I forgot
while you were screwing me.

Sorry.

Sorry.
I know I should have not called you.

I'm not gonna go through
this whole thing again.

I can't do it to her. I can't.

I'll see you next time?

Oh, Dick, Nina!
There's no future with her.

She weakens me.
Okay, all right. That's very helpful.

Edith is stability, Dick. She's my rock.

Give me a break, will you, please?

Did you tell Nina about the book?

Are you out of your fucking mind?

I've got the "I'm an asshole" part
down pretty good.

It's the "What do I do now?" part
I need help with.

Please? Be my friend?

Are you my friend?
Yeah, I'm your friend.

I don't know what I'm gonna do
if she asks me where I went.

Come clean.

She'll leave me, for good.

It's the best I got.
What else can I tell you?

You wanna hear this?

Yeah.

All right,
this is the Senate hearings, 1947.

I'm not even sure
that's a correct statement,

but the fact remains
that if I made 15 million dollars,

I made it selling oil well tools
and beer,

Grand Prize beer,
to people down in Texas.

"Beer down in Texas."

And I don't think the public
should be led to believe...

"Led to believe."

...on war contracts while I did not.
Now, furthermore...

"Now, furthermore..."

"Furthermore, Senator..."
"Furthermore..."

...a little money somewhere.
How could I put nine million dollars...

A little pocket change

worth five million dollars in my pocket.

Mr. Hughes, where would you
like to begin?

Family, friends, father...
Yeah.

My father. We'll do father.

People called my father Big Howard.

Big Howard...

Big Howard made his money
leasing drilling bits in the oil business.

He said to me... He said, "Sonny..."

"Sonny, these drill bits
are your bread and butter.

"Don't ever let 'em go."

Big Howard died when I was 18.

His bunch of Texas roughneck friends
tried to sell his company.

Pushed me out of the picture.
I don't like being pushed.

Now, when two parties negotiate,
you got a lion and a donkey.

One party, through bluster or leverage,

claims control of
the situation right away. That's the lion.

At 18,

I sued these men
trying to sell my father's company.

I sued them, I attacked them,
I blackmailed them,

I pushed every which way I could!

I learned to be a lion.

Jesus, Cliff.

Read the women's rags lately?
Hi.

Excerpts from
Howard Hughes' autobiography

in Ladies Home Journal
from the book by Robert Eaton.

Life's lawyers are gnawing
the flesh from my bones.

Would you like to tell me, Clifford,
what the fuck is going on here?

I don't know anything about this.

This goddamn Eaton
supposedly has memos,

the same handwritten memos
that you've got, so...

Either you're selling this twice and
using Robert Eaton as a pen name...

I won't even dignify that
with a response.

Or, more likely, your demigod
lunatic friend is using two writers.

You get it?

All the sharks at my company
have is you,

which means they will sue your skinny
ass for every cent of the advance,

plus damages,
for making false representations...

No, I made no false representations!

...about an exclusive book
you said you could deliver.

So she said that they said
that they would sue us both?

Yeah.
Both of us?

I mean, she mentioned me by name?
Yes.

Can you believe this son of a bitch
had the same idea?

But I spent the money.

I told you we might have to give it back!
Jeez, Dick.

Well, it wasn't exactly
a huge percentage to begin with.

Look, just pay the money.

Tell them that Hughes
has changed his mind.

And I'll owe you the difference.
I can't. I'm down most of it myself.

Yeah, well, borrow it.
This isn't a prank anymore, Cliff.

If they go to the press with this,

we're gonna have
Howard fucking Hughes chasing us.

And Intertel.

Remember, they'll stab us
with sodium pentothal?

They'll kill us or tie us up or something.

Howard won't be coming after us.
His advisors maybe, but he won't.

Oh, really?
Yeah.

What, he tell you that over breakfast?
Yeah.

And what about this other book?
What if that's the real thing, huh?

You thought about that?

All right, the question is,

what would Howard do
in a situation like this?

I don't know. Buy a fucking airline.

Diversion, end run, surprise.

Who are you now? General Patton?

Viruses and bacteria
are the most powerful enemies...

Luce.

...the human body has got.
You look at the fingernail clippings...

Henry Luce.

Dick, I think you should
take a little holiday.

You got everything?
You got your passport?

You got the letter? Okay, great.
Yeah, I'm fine...

You're gonna be fine. Bye.

Hello, this is Andrea.
Yeah, Andrea, it's Cliff.

Yeah, one more thing, Shelton Fisher
needs to be at the meeting.

Do you know who he is?

Chairman of McGraw-Hill, yes.

Has to be at the meeting.
All right, I'll see what I can do.

It's not me. It's him.
No negotiation. No Fisher, no meeting.

Mr. Irving, it would appear
that either you

or your illustrious sponsor
is jerking someone's chain.

Let me assure you that chain
will not be connected to Life magazine.

So, why don't you begin by telling us
who Robert Eaton is

and why he's selling the book
you're supposed to be writing?

Shelton, have you received
your mail today?

Excuse me?

Ralph, I was talking to Shelton.

As a side comment,
watch your tone with me.

I've been up for two nights negotiating
with a very stubborn billionaire,

and my quota for verbal abuse
has been reached.

Could you get the mail, please?

Life magazine has been known

to have a slight impact
on writers' careers, my friend.

And we...
We are not afraid of civil litigation.
