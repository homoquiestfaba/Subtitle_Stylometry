KNOCKED UP BY YOUR

I JUST CAN'T
SHAKE IT, BABE.

ISAIAH,

THAT'S MONEY.

AH, BROTHERHOOD.

<i>COMPA.</i>

SEEN YOU WALKING HAND IN HAND
DOWN BY THE OLD BRIDGE.

AND I OFTEN WONDER WHAT
THAT WOULD BE LIKE, <i>ESE.</i>

TO HAVE ME A <i>FIRME</i><i>
<i>LITTLE HONEY BABY...</i>

JUST LIKE THAT.

YOU BEEN DANCING WITH THE
DEVIL AGAIN, HAVEN'T YOU?

RENDER UNTO <i>DONA</i><i>
<i>THAT WHICH BELONGS TO DONA</i>

AND UNTO GOD
THAT WHICH BELONGS TO GOD.

WHITEY, NOT HERE.
DO NOT CALL ME THAT.

ONLY <i>MI PLEBE</i> CALL ME THAT.

<i>ANDA,</i> BRO.

I'M ASKING YOU, <i>CARNAL.</i>

<i>I GOTTA LIVE, TOO, BRO.</i><i>
<i>- SHH SHH.</i>

I GOTTA EAT.
SHH SHH SHH.

YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP,

MY <i>JEFITA,</i>

SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO
TOOK THE TIME TO COME AND VISIT.

SHE HAD MY BACK WHEN
NO ONE ELSE GAVE A RAT'S ASS.

AND THESE LITTLE THINGS,
THEY'RE TATTOOED ON <i>MI CORAZON.</i>

THAT'S WHY I TAKE IT
VERY PERSONAL

WHEN A LITTLE <i>PUNETA</i><i>
<i>SUCH AS YOURSELF</i>

DECIDES TO BURN <i>MI JEFITA.</i>

<i>NOW YOU GOTTA DEAL</i>
<i>WITH THE FUCKING DEVIL.</i>

YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IN LIFE...

WE SEE THINGS AND WE-

WE WONDER,

"AM I REALLY SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING?

IS IT AN ILLUSION?

A VISION?

OR AM I JUST MAKING IT UP
IN MY MIND?"

LOOK AT ME WHEN
I'M TALKING TO YOU, <i>CHAVALO.</i>

IT'S TIME.

THIS IS WHAT
I WANNA SEE.

<i>IS THIS HOW IT IS?</i>

YOU WANNA GET <i>LOCO?</i>

WELL, LET'S ALL GET <i>LOCO.</i>

<i>TOMA.</i>

YOU FIRST.

OOPS.

<i>ITOMALO!</i>

ELECTRIFIED, TERRIFIED,
LOOK IN MY EYES.

<i>MORTIFIED CRIES</i>
<i>SATURATE THE NIGHT SKY.</i><i>

SHRIEK AFTER SHRIEK
SYMBOLIZE MY DEMISE.

TRUDGING THE STREETS,
MY FACE A DISGUISE.

<i>UNDER THE BRIDGE</i>
<i>IS WHERE I RESIDE,</i>

<i>SHOOTING THE FIX</i>
<i>JUST TO SURVIVE.</i>

<i>AWAITING TO EXIT</i>
<i>THIS WORLD I DESPISE.</i>

SEARCHING FOR TRUTH

BENEATH THE SURFACE LIES.

HELLACIOUS FIXATIONS.

DARKNESS, DAMNATION.
IN LIFE I DESCEND

AND IN DEATH I ARISE!

MY MIND HAS BEEN RUNNING

WITH A- A MILLION
THOUGHTS TODAY.

BUT I AM BLESSED.

THE BOND BETWEEN
LIFELONG FRIENDS

IS NOTHING
LESS THAN BEAUTIFUL.

<i>RESPETO.</i><i>

<i>- SALUD.</i>
<i>- SALUD.</i>

<i>MIJITA,</i> WHAT-
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

YOU SENT HIM?

YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

I LOVED HIM.

OKAY?
I LOVED HIM

AND YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME!

FUCKING BITCH!
DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!

YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME,
YOU SICK WICKED BITCH!

YOU DARE...

GET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT.
<i>FUCKING MURDERER!</i>

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
<i>MIJITA,</i> HUH?

I REMEMBER YOU!

DO WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO, BITCH!

I'M RIGHT FUCKING HERE, <i>CABRONA!</i>

DO WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO, <i>PENDEJA!</i>

<i>DO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO! I'M</i>
RIGHT FUCKING HERE,  <i>CABRONA.</i>

I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING
AT ISAIAH'S TONIGHT.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

HEY, YOU WANNA
TALK TO ME?

NO, I'M GOOD.

WHAT HAPPENED?

NOTHING.

OKAY? I'M ALL RIGHT. I GOT IT.

IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

THIS IS BULLSHIT, ALICIA.

WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET YOUR
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL?

DON'T DO THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU
'CAUSE ALL YOU DO IS JUDGE!

YOU SAY, "TALK TO ME"?

YOU DON'T EVEN
FUCKING LISTEN.

ALL YOU GIVE A FUCK ABOUT
IS YOU, THAT'S IT.

WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN HERE
FOR YOU?

I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHIT
ALONE FOR FIVE FUCKING YEARS!

AND ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO GET
YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND SNAP.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ME.

AND YOU PROBABLY
NEVER WILL.

DON'T FUCKING WALK AWAY FROM
ME. I'M TALKING TO YOU HERE.

DON'T TOUCH ME.

LEAVE ME ALONE.
ALICIA!

MOVE, LUPE!

RIGHT, IF YOU LEAVE NOW...

DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT COMING BACK.

<i>¿OISTE?</i>

THINGS DIDN'T
GO SO SMOOTH, DID THEY?

WHAT DID YOU DO?

<i>¿HIJO?</i>

<i>EL TERMINO.</i>

SERIOUSLY, ALICIA.

HEY, DO WHAT

OH, BULLSHIT, ALICIA.

IT KIND OF KILLS
YOUR TASTE FOR GAMES.

I MEAN, WHAT CAN COMPARE WITH
CHEATING DEATH ON THE DAILY?

IT'S ADRENALINE
OVERLOAD SHIT.

IF YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH A KNIFE

<i>MERO LEON DEL TRABAJO.</i>

YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN
THEY USED TO CALL HIM THAT.

OH, WE'RE ALL LINKED HERE,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

EITHER BY BLOOD

OR BY... SUFFERING.

TIMES ARE
DIFFERENT NOW.

PEOPLE TODAY, THEY JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT.

QUE TRISTE.

HUH?

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

JUST LIKE OLD TIMES,
HUH, BRO?

OKAY, BIG BOY.

AHH.
RED ROVER, RED ROVER.

YOU LEARNED SOME SHIT, HUH?

OH, COME ON- OH!

OH, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.

I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU.

WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO SLEEP, BABY BRO?

GO TO SLEEP, BABY BRO.

GO TO SLEEP.
AND NO FUCKING TAPPING OUT.

YOU FUCKING BITCH!

YOU FUCKER!

I'M GONNA FUCKING
KILL YOU!

I'M GONNA FUCK YOU UP!

FUCKING BITCH.

LUPE!

NOTHING LASTS FOREVER, BABY.

YOU REMIND ME OF MY MAMA-

BATSHIT CRAZY.

OH, BUT YOU GOT A FIRE.

I LIKE THAT.

WHAT MAMA DON'T KNOW
WON'T HURT HER.

<i>... GIVE A FUCK ABOUT IS YOU!</i>

<i>- I'M HER MOTHER.</i>
<i>- I'M ALL SHE'S FUCKING GOT!</i>

CARE FOR A <i>FRAJO?</i>

MY FATHER BELIEVED
IN KARMA.

YOU BELIEVE
IN KARMA?

WELL, HE DIDN'T
EXACTLY CALL IT KARMA.

HE CALLED IT
SOMETHING ELSE.

MORE OR LESS
THE SAME THING.

YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

WHAT GOES AROUND,

COMES AROUND.

YOU UNDERSTAND?

I DON'T BELIEVE
IN KARMA, PER SE.

BUT I DO BELIEVE
IN JUSTICE.

MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

IT'S JUST THAT ONE

IS LEVIED BY GOD,

THE UNIVERSE,

WHAT-NOT,

IN GOD'S TIMING.

AND THE OTHER

IS DELIVERED BY MAN.

OR IN THIS CASE

A WOMAN

AND A SNAKE.

POSITIVELY MYTHICAL.

<i>SUENOS DULCES, FANTASMA.</i>

SWEET DREAMS.

<i>OYE...</i>

YOUR MAMA WILL
COME HERE SOON

TO TUCK YOU IN.

<i>A VOLAR, BRUJO.</i>

<i>IBRUJO!</i>

<i>I COME TO MAKE</i>
<i>MY PEACE.</i>

WHERE'S <i>MI HIJO?</i>

<i>IBRUJO!</i>

ANSWER ME!

<i>SERIO.</i>

THERE'S A <i>REMEDIO</i><i>
<i>FOR EVERYTHING,</i>

EXCEPT FOR DEATH.

YOU!

<i>IPUTA!</i>

THE SCENT
NEVER LEAVES YOU.

I CAN STILL
SMELL MOM SOMETIMES-

HER CINNAMON GUM

AND HER PERFUME.

YEAH.

SOMETHING ABOUT
THE SMELL THAT JUST

DIGS ITSELF DEEP.

<i>AMO</i> LIKE FUCK,
MY BABY SISTER.

LET'S GO.

IT'S TIME.
