On January 5, 2010, George Lucas
<i> appeared on The Daily Show </ i> ...

To speak ...
on the launch of historical book.

But Jon Stewart had
other questions in mind.

Does the Senator Organa
takes Leia to Alderaan ...

Darth Sidious ... and not feel
a disturbance in the Force?

Really. You expect me to make
that can raise Leia on Alderaan ...

... And Sith Lords
will not notice anything?

In other words, is Kenobi on Tatooine!
He lives very close!

POETRY NIGHT
GEORGE LUCAS TODAY

<i> # And now I'll show you, kid
On the genius of George Luc # </ i>

Dear George Lucas ...

Your followers lost constructed
a monument to your masterpiece ...

... And murder its creator
with contempt?

George Lucas ruined
the last years of my adolescence.

Love and hate George Lucas' heart.

One day, he was only
a pastor of nerfs of Tatooine.

It was one of us.

There is something about our love
by <i> Wars </ i> ...

That is different ...
of our love for others.

It is rare that these films
can upset people.

But you really angry.

<i> Wars </ i> is
most important to me.

Do not say it's only a movie.
It's not just a movie!

Without good G.L.,
we would have nothing of this!

Or this!

Stop that ship!

Chewie, get us out of here!

There was something inspiring in the universe
of <i> Wars </ i> ...

<i> ... moves the first

<i> ... two pictures with music. </ i>

Yes, the Bible!

<i> suddenly say, "You know, </ i>

<i> There is a chapter 5.5 of Genesis,

I added the scene of Jabba the Hutt
with Han Solo ...

It was a scene ...
that had been cut ...

Due to limitations ...
of time and money ...

And when I finished ...
the third movie ...

I really wanted to ... put it there.

It was stupid.
It was a little ...

It was great to appear

From a dramatic standpoint,
the scene is totally unnecessary.

We had technical difficulties <i>

In fact, going to see your boss.

The upcoming changes, I think ...

That were made ... ...

... Because George is not the same director

Greedo ... when faced
Han in the cantina ...

They removed the gun ...

Yes, sure.

Then did the special editions,
Greedo shoots first ...

When we did in the trilogy, Han
shoot first, and crazy people.

There was a huge reaction.
Crazy!

I hope this long.

Yes, no doubt.

THAT IS THE IDEA!
I HOPE THIS MAKES THAT MUCH!

Yes, no doubt!

Who cares

It is not stupid.

When you enter the heart <i>

It is a betrayal.

For those who love the movie ...

It's as disappointing.

However,

And that, with its flaws, is
what affects people.

If Jackson Pollock later said:

"That's the mark of a boot ...

... And I dropped the cigarette.
Let it off "...

Say ... "No, smoking
is fundamental in the picture! "

He would say: "No, I dropped the cigarette.

February 1997.

George Lucas tries to return
to write history.

It's like a Holocaust denier,
but he denies <i> Wars </ i>.

It seems to say: "It never existed.
Do not worry. "

It's horrible to say
someone who grew up loving something.

JEFF BOND
Editor in chief of Geek Monthly <i> </ i>

Once we saw
the original films ...

As presented ...
for the first time, in cinemas ...

... And we recorded in the mind as well,
that's it.

It hurts, physically.

It's like putting you by force
memories of another person ...

... Instead of yours.

SINGING IN THE RAIN

Digitally Remastered <i>
and restored to widescreen ... </ i>

<i> ... by the same George Lucas. </ i>

<i> The public wants to see
the original versions ... </ i>

... Who created the emotional impact.

The elimination of that choice ...

... Is an insult to fans
George Lucas.

With all due respect to Mr. Lucas ...

... Is not only his dream, his fantasy.

Joe Leydon
Film critic <i> Variety </ i>

It is a universe
in which we all live now.

It's an interesting question:

Does the public right to material
their own culture?

I would say yes.

I think once released ...
God!

Think about it. You're throwing material.

Is it yours or of others?

I think it's shared.
Yes

I want to make the analogy
the shirt that belongs to you ...

<i> ... And Star Wars </ i>
is that shirt for George Lucas.

He owns that shirt.

And you can do whatever he wants with it.

Now, what happens ...
But it is despicable.

You have to respect some
the fans.

Are the same people who bought
an empty cardboard box ...

<i> ... Kenner in 1977. </ i>

It is irresponsible because you say:

"I created this bloody empire ...

... In you all,
of those who got millions of dollars. "

And they pay you with, "I do not care."

At one level, this puts a burden
excess of any artist.

Who can stand the fact
that suddenly ...

Everyone feels ... owning your art?

Thanks to Lucas, the VHS is still alive.

ARMANDO Gasalla
Madrid, Spain

And I still have my recording
of the original film ...

I have it saved ...
to review from time to time ...

... And view the original material.

This material provides laser disk ...

... The best versions available ...

... From the original films.

With these discs, fans
digital files created ...

... And threw them on the Internet
to get off free.

Actually, this is illegal,
but from a moral point of view ...

... Preserve our cultural heritage.

I started this site called <i>
"Original Trilogy" ... </ i>

<i> ... whose purpose was to provide ... </ i>

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

<i> a meeting ...
for unhappy people. </ i>

<i> And out came the idea of ??the petition. </ i>

<i> Within the first 24 hours,
get about 10,000 signatures. </ i>

And within the next few months ...

Some 78,000 ... we
firms confirmed.

RESPONSE PUBLIC RELATIONS
Lucasfilm

This comes from the department <i>
Public Relations for Lucasfilm. </ i>

"We expect to launch these films
'Original' in a bonus disc. "

<i> "Original" appeared in quotes
by the way ... </ i>

Like they really ...
were not the originals.

It's something we invented.

The negatives of the films
were permanently altered ...

For the creation ...
Special Editions of ...

Impressions ... and existing
early versions deteriorated.

"As the films do not represent
George's artistic vision. "

We said they did not even exist.

Not even possible.

Why go back on the argument
artistic vision?

"We want you to know
we have no intention ...

... Now or in the future,

to restore earlier versions. "

In essence, says that
the original negative no longer exists ...

... Because of its restoration.

But how could it be?

Because there must be transformed
the films on digital ...

And then ... must have worked
in their new special effects ...

... With the digital version.

And then this new digital version
be transformed back to tape.

So now the film there
in the new version.

But you still have the original tape
with which it started working.

No, really,
physically cut a negative.

A file ...

It doubles the negative, then
changes are made after that.

So I find it hard to believe ...

They have really destroyed ...
the negative of the film.

And if they did, it's atrocious.

"Never again you will see the original."

That says Lucasfilm
but probably not true.

In the mid-eighties,
There was a filmmaker ...

... It was on a crusade
against Ted Turner ...

I wanted color ... movies
black and white.

The same filmmaker argued
that black and white films ...

Were the epitome ...
of our cultural heritage ...

... And that not due modify.

That was filmmaker George Lucas.

In 1988, George Lucas testified
before Congress ...

Against the colored ...
of black and white films.

The following year, <i> WAR </ i>
<i> OF GALAXIES </ i> was a ...

... The first 25 films
entered the National Film Registry.

In the future it will be easier
the negatives are lost ...

... And are "replaced"
altered by new films.

This would be a great loss
for our society.

Do not allow our
cultural history is rewritten.

George Lucas
1988 congressional testimony

Never heard <i>. </ i>

Then I say, "What rot."

He says: "There can be colored
old movies ...

... But I'm going to completely change
my film and it will ".

It's obscene.
Okay, because I wanted ...

You lideraste campaign
against the color of the films.

You know why they should not be changed.

HUNTERS OF THE LOST ARK

Is different. These are my movies.

<i> One could argue ... </ i>

<i> ... that if you entered
National Register ... </ i>

Episode IV: A NEW HOPE
FILM - 1977

<i> ... belongs to the whole world. </ i>

<i> belongs to all Americans ... </ i>

<i> ... because it is so important,
culturally, to the United States. </ i>

So when you say,
indiscriminately:

"We will change it and improve it ...

... And evolve with the times "...

Sculpt ... it's like Bill Clinton
on Mount Rushmore.

Has a responsibility
with the history of cinema.

You know ...

Can you get Congress to send:

"You must deliver that
Smithsonian museum now "?

Maybe not,
but would be great to happen.

The Library of Congress rejected
all our requests for interviews.

Like the Film Archive
and Television at UCLA ...

... And the Association of Archivists
Moving Image.

Mr. Lucas, please throw them.

At least,
them available to people.

Please give us the original film.
Forever.

Just give us the original.

Although not remove
in the case of 70 albums ...

... Where you have to buy the 70 ...

... For example,
all versions of <i> The Clone Wars </ i>.

I'll buy it,
sell the rest of the Internet ...

Cherish ... and damn the three discs
I want. All right.

Steven Spielberg launched
an edition of <i> E. T. </ i>

It is a double album.

<i> changed some things digitally. </ i>

<i> Then there's the original version </ i>
<i> </ i> E.T <i>. </ i>

E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial
ORIGINAL FILM

<i> I think </ i> Blade Runner <i> there </ i>
<i> in five different versions. </ i>

Brazil <i> there </ i>
<i> in three different versions. </ i>

Terry Gilliam accepted
these various versions.

When Criterion released the box
including all versions ...

<i> ... even he hated
and which had nothing to do. </ i>

THE ONLY BRAZIL
NO CUT BY TERRY GILLIAM

What better way for Lucas ...

Demonstrate their confidence ...
in the changes you made?

Putting both on the same disk ...

... And say:
"Take, watch one after the other.

Compare the two.
I think this is better. "

It has nothing to do
with creativity ...

The great success of
<i> Wars </ i> ...

Failed to ... independence ...

Film ... and to staff.

George never made another film
after that ...

But transformed ...
a producer and entrepreneur.

In a way,
is the worst thing that happened to George Lucas.

Could have made a happy career
doing dramas ...

Some documentaries ...
and cutting edge material.

But became
in a large corporate entity.

He was someone who struggled
against the institutions ...

<i> ... and turned it

It is arguable that the success of the series

WENDY IDE
Film critic for The Times <i> </ i> (London)

I consider myself a filmmaker.

And I had a discussion
in a lecture theater ...

... With George Cukor, who does not like
the word "filmmaker".

Compared with toymaker.

I like to see me as
a toy manufacturer who films.

IAN PARKER

We are like Oliver <i> saying
"Please sir, can I get more?" </ I>

And instead of saying no
George Lucas says:

"Yes! I have a lot more oats."

I can not imagine <i> landfills,
with the passing of this generation ... </ i>

<i> ... the legacy we leave will be
a lot of plastic. </ i>

And I'm partly responsible.

Admittedly <i>
that is global capitalism ... </ i>

<i> ... and global consumerism. </ i>

<i> George Lucas did not invent that. </ i>

<i> was found embedded
in a strange relationship about it ... </ i>

... And as a result, all
we are from the same way.

<i> I buy almost everything </ i>
<i> you say "</ i> The <i> Star Wars." </ i>

It is a contract.

Well? It's like ...

If you throw something <i> quality

But that does not happen.

Every time you throw things.

JOSE MELENDEZ - ELLIOTT SERRANO
Comic culture warrior

Not enough space or money.

George Lucas, what I can say?

FAYE ANASTASIA - Wife and mother
disgruntled fan of the series

That man ruined my life.
I took my husband, my son ...

Consumed every dollar ... and I had
and I could never save.

All toys that are
behind me here ...

... I have made the heart ache
Over the past 30 years.

I think I'll throw a box of products
and sell expensive.

I will not tell people
separately that cost less.

It would be fun.

I bought it on VHS.

NATHAN BEAUDRY
Alias ??ChefElf

I bought the whole box

three or four times.

This is the last box,
and I bought it like an idiot.

This <i> because it brings things </ i>
<i> </ i> Star Wars <i> and </ i> Jedi ...

<i> ... and the next
because it is mastered ... </ i>

<i> ... thus is improved. </ i>

I went to buy <i>
because it was widescreen. </ i>

<i> again because
was a special assembly. </ i>

Do not know why I bought that, but ...

It's like giving us an orgasm.

We had an orgasm, and now says:

"Come on, no more."

We say: "Enough. Let me sleep."

That that, "I being exploited" ...

NAR WILLIAMS
TV Presenter, Producer

Please. Let's be serious.

Someone <i> provides a product,
you choose to buy it. </ i>

<i> If you want to see,
or if you have it ... </ i>

<i> ... has nothing to do
with who did it. </ i>

They did it because they thought
I could have a market.

In this case, they are right.

If the fans want to buy everything
what set George ...

<i> ... as if compelled ... </ i>

<i> ... is like a drug. </ i>

You can say someone became addicted.

Finally, it is you that is injected.

There are many people like this ...

... And perhaps always be addicts
to <i> Wars </ i>.

I, personally, since I left ...

Takashi Okazaki
Afro Samurai creator <i> </ i>

Now only buy ...
R2-D2 products.

<i> We would love to live in a world
that do not buy anything ... </ i>

<i> ... but let's face it, not ... </ i>

<i> ... and finally,
We love what we buy. </ i>

If you add that to the resentment ...

<i> growing followers ...
against George Lucas ... </ i>

<i> ... you'll notice a tortuous relationship
with the objects sold. </ i>

By God!

Think it's easy to abandon this.

Now that I talk about this,
I feel I was in therapy.

Hello, my name is Chris.

The fans kept him alive ...

... With toys,
the stories and speculation ...

Whether there would ... more adventures
of this series and how they would be.

Caravan of Courage is <i> </ i>,

Want more, and when there is nothing ...

... You take care of creating something yourself.

13 JANUARY 1995

When they announced <i>
that finally would come ... </ i>

<i> ... my first thought is
this would be the best ... </ i>

EPISODE ONE
"EL COMINEZO"

... It would launch.

All want to see this movie.

This will be a giant time
that will define a generation.

<i> - All fans ...
"What will?" </ I>

Created his film ... ...

... Created it in his head.
Yes

Then I thought:
"By God, we all hate."

It may not hate
because it has ...

much involved emotionally <i>
in the first. </ i>

I remember the day
they announced the name ...

<i> ... And The Phantom Menace </ i> came out
and they all said:

"What does that mean?"
"What the hell does that mean?"

As of Friday,
thousands of theaters around the country ...

Siskel and Ebert

Launched a new advances ... ...

... What might be described ...

As the premiere ...
most anticipated of the decade.

Five words:
<i> Wars </ i>.

<i> - The Wars.
The Wars. </ I>

<i> - The Wars.
The Wars. </ I>

<i> Wars. </ i>

<i> - Fans lined up ... </ i>
Just to see the progress.

<i> Publication The Hollywood Reporter </ i>
said that the Mann's Chinese Theater ...

Competition ... went up to 1,100% ...

<i> surprise ... when presented
a preview of the film. </ i>

No, I will go after the advance.
I do not know.

Did you pay to enter
just to see the progress ...

... And then you left?
Yes

Because they are two and a half minutes great.

It was amazing.

There was never anything like it.

By God!

I began to mourn
as not doing in years.

I had a heart attack.

I think God should be ashamed
as a creator to watch this movie ...

And realize ...
that did not create something that good.

This is something I will remember
and tell my children.

It's camera - I know, I look crazy.

It was like a Beatles concert.

DENNIS Przywara
Director of <i> Starwoids </ i>

It was like, "Obi-Wan Kenobi is

... And you thought the world
was going to end.

"God, if the world ends, I hope to live
May 19 to see this ...

There never was anything so promoted

Let's see <i> Wars </ i>!

THE STAR WARS
EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE

<i> I was there, like everyone else,
in May 1999, in line ... </ i>

<i> ... lightsaber in hand, late night. </ i>

I saw that movie
ILM in San Francisco.

<i> saw in Madison, Wisconsin ... </ i>

<i> ... in a movie theater called the Orpheum immense. </ i>

It had 1,700 seats <i> and crowded. </ i>

Everyone was there.
There was much expectation.

People were jumping <i> the seats ... </ i>

Happy ... they were crazy.

<i> Then the lights went out,
and they all shouted. </ i>

<i> During the progress, people booed. </ i>

<i> Lucasfilm logo appeared,
and all cheer again. </ i>

They make your hair stand on end
when you see ...

"Long ago,

<i> When you see him on screen. </ i>

THE STAR WARS

Opening appears,
and people are crazy ...

That's incredible.

Who thought this day would come?

And it was one of the greatest moments ...

Life ... a spectator.

Then begins the film.

I knew that. The language
of the opening sequence was wrong.

Not appreciated as correct.

But I said, "Okay. I'll keep looking."

It started as a glow
in the heart ...

Down ... and then ...

... Down here.

I remember thinking:
"By God, Is it really ...?

Is that bad? "

I was very disappointed.

I said "What? Is it bad?"

I began to get discouraged ...

But ... continued:
"It <i> Wars </ i>. Will improve.

The Jedi is not great, does not matter.
It will be good. "

Was used to seeing
people who saw the original ...

Screaming ... excited,
clapping, laughing.

This was indeed
a silent projection.

Perhaps it was something different.
You may not notice it.

Perhaps we should see her again.

It was the first time in my life ...

A movie ...
really disappointed me ...

I was sad ... and ...

... To the point of having to lie about
what was to maintain the honor.

I remember interviewing
in local news ...

... Where they said:
"Yes, but tomorrow we go again."

There was still hope.

People are not convinced ...

... Until I saw her ...

... Because everyone saw it twice.

We all saw it again.

I waited four days <i> in the rain ... </ i>

<i> ... peeing in my hands and drinking it
to buy tickets ... </ i>

<i> ... to see </ i> The Phantom Menace
<i> third time </ i>

<i> Yes </ i>

They are like the victims who return
the scene ...

Andrew Weekes

To assume it ... somehow.

I went one and again.

But not having fun ...

... But rather to convince
that amused me.

In part it was to accept what it was.

I realized ...
that I was enjoying it more.

What a disappointment!

# All began

<i> # My girlfriend had picked the hair # </ i>

<i> # But it turned out that the film
not what I expected # </ i>

<i> Tell me what you want. </ i>

<i> Wars </ i> did not care
people who both wanted.

Is this the best you can do?

Eighteen years old.

We can not separate
how to see things now ...

How we saw them ... then ...

... And how we see them on the basis
of how we saw then.

When he left <i> The Phantom Menace </ i>,
I noticed a change in the followers ...

... That went from fans
George Lucas ...

... To take it so personally ...

They thought ...
George Lucas wrote ...

... The film to annoy them.
Yes

<i> Shut up! You are wrong. </ I>

five minutes. We appreciate it.

Sometimes listening.

But that takes <i> Episode II </ i>
where Jar Jar first appears ...

Anakin meets ... and all ...

<i> ... and approaches,
looks at the camera and seems to smile ... </ i>

... As saying: "I'm still here, folks.

I know you hate me, but I will go. "

You really try to get angry?

And will not give ...
the desire of followers.

I think he thinks
that is true to its principles.

I had 3PO <i> cry out against Jar Jar ... </ i>

<i> ... and took notes
tone down at first. </ i>

Then I saw coming from George notes:

"No, 3PO should be tougher with Jar Jar.

KEVIN RUBIO
<i> Writer Clone Wars </ i>

You should treat it like the fans. "

As a fan of burlesque
and mixture of genres ...

I like to watch ... seriously
of the Force ...

Comedy ... and a Gungan trying
eating fruit in the same shot.

This combination seems to me successful ...

... Because one does not negate the other.

Jar-Jar Binks is proof to me ...

Lucas ... that still has things
that show ...

Still want to risk ... ...

CROS RENAN
Film scholar and writer

... And not see it as a
exaggerated character.

Is an experiment
it connotes a persistent desire ...

Giving a show ...
to the public.

The problem with Jar Jar Binks
not the character.

It is with you, the fans,
they have forgotten what it was to be children.

Kids like Jar Jar!
Why?

What about the Ewoks?

They were rubbish. Not complain of them.

Yeah, but Jar Jar Binks makes
that the Ewoks look like Shaft.

<i> - Kids like Jar Jar.
Prequel ... Yes </ i>

I had to dress like that monster
and go to the birthday.

Who knows?

You were not there at first.

You do not know what is good and important it was.

That's all for you ...

Toys ... this ad exaggerated.

People like you make me sick.
What is it?

My friend who has a child of 7 years
<i> loves Star Wars </ i>.

But for him,
everything is <i> Wars </ i>.

Episodes I-VI, <i> The Clone Wars </ i>
and video games.

What Luke did well for us ...

Seems to continue to do well ...
for children today.

What you love about the movies?

Me?

I like that.

Movies are not competing, right?

It is condescending way ...

Because it makes these movies ...
for children.

What has been said many times.
Yes

George said:
"These films are for kids.

I make them for children. "

And when we loved the trilogy
original, we were kids.

Does George or old age is upon us?

Should we, as adults,
understand what it does as a filmmaker ...

... Or should have made films
for people who matured ...

... And enjoyed the first?

I think that
that is made for children ...

... And that's why I did not understand,
is nonsense.

Yes, it is difficult to know
if you really believe that ...

Or taken by surprise ...
and had to give a reason.

<i> If the child did, what they
care about the Trade Federation ... </ i>

Fees and charges ...
and sessions of the Senate and ...?

I tried to explain to my 5 year old
on the trade embargo.

Is distracting.
Yes ... It was thus

One word sums
all that is wrong ...

Insulted ... and how all
fans, "midi-chlorians."

Midi-chlorians.

Talk about it.
Midi-chlorians.

I also like.
Midi-chlorians.

And the Force?
They are microscopic bacteria ...

In your blood ...
which are called midi-chlorians.

If you do not take this seriously, I go.

When Obi-Wan Kenobi introduces

It's a lovely idea,
a lovely notion.

Then reduced to a biological factor.

<i> ... that is supposed to be linked

<i> ... and your moral code ... </ i>

It's accessible then.

DAVID BRIN
Author of <i> The Postman </ i>

Mutants was not something ...

... Superheroes, demigods.

It was something tangible.

How to say:
"Look how much religion you have.

See how much spirit and faith you have. "

But the idea of ??the Force ...
It's ruined.

NAR WILLIAMS - TV Presenter
BOO FRIEDMANN - Screenwriter

No, it - Ruined?
Yes

What essentially teaches the Force?

Live without fear, without anger.

Do good for yourself and others.
Be opened.

My blood tests
says I can not do that.

That is nonsense.

It's like the Scientologists and their tetanes.

Enough. No Scientologists goals.

You can not worry
what others think.

For example, <i> Wars </ i>
is my story, as my house is my home.

And if I want to paint my house green ...

Even if everyone thinks ...
should be red.

I'm going to paint Jar Jar.

I think <i> Wars </ i>
original, or at least ...

<i> ... A New Hope </ i>
and <i> The Empire Strikes Back </ i> are great ...

And have made ...
in collaboration with other people.

When George decided to face
the prequels and do it in a vacuum ...

I do not think ... that's the best way
to work for an artist.

It's over a certain level of criticism.

He spent the idea of ??a
true collaboration.

This is about a channeling
internal stories ...

... Who have been on your mind
for a long time.

I wanted to control my work ...

... And that people do not change.

It's fun
because I do not answer to anyone.

Nobody tells me what to do.
I earned it.

<i> If you have a film empire
to help you make movies ... </ i>

What's the point ...
if you do not feed back?

I think he took something wonderful
and maintain control over that ...

Capitalized ... while with him,
I think it destroyed.

Yes, it's like an overprotective parent.
And if so, ruined his son.

And that bothers
because he had a bright son.

It's a great day for you.
Wait while I prepare.

What will prepare?
Your new study, silly.

For you to continue writing the series.
How?

Write <i> Episode III </ i>, George.

But this time, will do well.

You'll do as I see it.

At the time,
it hurt a lot ...

The studies ... to ride again
THX-1138 and American Graffiti.

He swore to himself
this will never happen again ...

... Because from now on ...

Would have total control ...
about their jobs.

In 1999, fans began
to reassemble his movies ...

With the tools ...
Luke offered.

This is perhaps one of the best.
Episode is called <i> I.II </ i>.

Is a cover of about 70 minutes.
And it's a much better movie.

But I love this legend:
"Look how they should be."

And then a graph of BAND-AID.

It's hard not to read most of the
Fan mounts a critique ...

Creative decisions ...
taken by George Lucas.

So this
is what most hurts him.

How I can invest so much time,
energy and passion in this ...

Yes

From the point of view of control,

Controls how the fans will ...

... Under what conditions will be.

And they must accept it.

Control their image.

Made a fatal mistake ...

... And did everything possible to erase it.

It was the Christmas Special <i> </ i>
<i> The Star Wars </ i>.

The story,
who for years denied their existence.

When Lucas occasionally
recognizes that there ...

Generally ... says:
"If I could track all the copies ...

... And destroy them with a hammer,
I would. "

It is the worst television material
ever created.

The concept of this special ...

Chewbacca ... is that you must re-
to his home planet, Kashyyyk ...

<i> Day ... for life

How many people saw <i> Christmas Special </ i>

In some cultures,
is a war crime.

Very soon realized
that this was damaging ...

Luke ... the image and brand
<i> Wars </ i> ...

... And tried to remove it
history.

Without success.

Here is my copy
perfectly legitimate ...

<i> ... The Holiday Special </ i>
<i> of Star Wars </ i>.

If it looks like a digital copy of a VHS
poorly coded ...

... To Internet format,
is an effect of the lens.

It's part of history
of <i> Wars </ i>.

It's like the Holy Grail.

It is finding Bigfoot
or the monster of Loch Ness.

It's like finding

We all get obsessed with something.

Will it end the obsession

I do not know.

How long can you see a grater

Never saw ...

She felt very neglected

So I see that it is impossible

I left it completely.
I burned all my toys.

I had no toys.

But to have them ...
The would burn ...

I do not like this.

I especially like Droid <i> Wars </ i>.

What did George Lucas
what I enjoyed ...

... It was horrible.

<i> One of the worst things you can do

They are consumed by their hatred

I give it all for you.
I watch your movies. Buy your toys.

Even I burned my copy of
Christmas special to make you happy.

How do you thank me?

Do the fans of this film
need to overcome?

Not necessarily. There are professionals.

At the Cannes Film Festival ...

At the premiere ...
Indiana Jones 4 ...

... To finish the film,
someone stood up and shouted:

"George, you should stop us harm."

Is interesting
that Spielberg did not mention ...

Have thought ... but immediately
Luke.

Indiana Jones survives
a nuclear explosion in a fridge.

Some people
that hangs from vines like Tarzan.

And no damn aliens.
What the hell?

They did an episode of South Park <i> </ i> ...

Where kids ...
speak with ambiguity ...

... On a violation that occurred
in the city. They are sad and upset.

What happened, happened.
We can not change it.

We must overcome.
Get over it?

They raped our friend, Stan.

And as you ask the public:

"Who raped?"
And then you realize.

Indiana Jones, you look good.

Lucas and Spielberg graphically <i> are
raping Indiana Jones. </ i>

We could not do that
here in Japan.

I took a couple of my entertainers ...

Eric Stough
Animation director <i> South Park </ i>

<i> ... South Park </ i>, and went to see her.

We feel that George Lucas <i>
Steven Spielberg and ... </ i>

<i> ... they treated us like idiots. </ i>

Why did you do that to <i> Indiana Jones </ i>?

The episode of South Park was
actually greater impact ...

The fans ... that <i> Indiana Jones 4 </ i>.

BRANDON KLEYLA
Director of <i> Indyfans </ i>

We believe that this was his closing.

We feel the same as the boys.

We have not talked about it
since it happened.

What do you think Lucas
on that episode of South Park <i> </ i>?

George, what do you think?
No matter what I think.

What do you say?

When I think of Luke,
I think <i> Captain EO </ i>.

When I think <i> Captain EO </ i>,
I think of Michael Jackson.

So when I think
Michael Jackson ...

Disneyland ... I think.

When I think of Michael Jackson ...

I think ... and George Lucas
and <i> Captain EO </ i> ...

... And Disneyland
I think of my childhood.

Then I go into a strange place ...

George Lucas ... where,
my childhood and Michael Jackson.

G.L. - I - M.J.

By God!

I was at a convention and saw
some guys selling a shirt ...

... That said:
"George Lucas raped my childhood".

Is there a song:
<i> "George Lucas raped my childhood </ i>"?

# George Lucas raped our childhood #

# George Lucas raped our childhood #

# George Lucas raped our childhood #

Nobody <i> violated my childhood,
much less George Lucas. </ i>

And frankly,
if a course George Lucas ...

I would like to have sex ... ...

Metaphorical ... with my childhood ...

Would be a beautiful relationship ...
consensual sexual.

I do not think you can say:
"George Lucas ruined my childhood" ...

... Because you still live your childhood.

You act like a child.

What took you children?

<i> Did you buy toys?
Did you have fun? Were you inspired? </ I>

Shut up.

Not drinking <i> characters
and doing terrible things to them. </ i>

Or maybe, yes.

Although we deserved.

Why were dressed like ...

<i> ... in that part of the city,
at night ... </ i>

<i> ... if we were not
asking for trouble? </ i>

And in the mind of George,
gave us what we wanted.

He gave us new movies.
We do not ask them to be good.

Just ask <i> Wars </ i>.

One can say
George Lucas is a seducer.

I would say that the battered woman
better example.

<i> bad Dad is hitting us ... </ i>

<i> ... but still go to him
for us to stick a little more. </ i>

Come with me.
No!

How to ruin your life?
Because it's a terrible story.

When I was in the movie, I thought:
"Damn, there goes ...

My childhood ... ".

It was exciting.

Leave to indict this man
lying to himself ...

... Or to deceive,
or ruin our fun ...

... Or all that.

But just because I mocked him in my
comic strip and I want to sue me.

I think we are so annoying ...

<i> Franchise ... because the War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> represents something.

This is what we recall as the most pure ...

In terms of experience ...
film. Is the base.

There are no villains in this story.

For us as fans, is better
have an executive to blame ...

But we do not ... ...

... We realize that George is
the executive and creative.

There are many mixed feelings.

Luke's own career is
as the rise and fall of Anakin.

I should not have been <i>
the first person to say that. </ i>

WIRED
GEORGE LUCAS WITHOUT THE MASK

<i> fought against the corporate system,
which I did not like ... </ i>

<i> ... and not make me happy
that corporations ... </ i>

<i> have taken control ...
of the film industry. </ i>

But now I find <i>
as president of a corporation. </ i>

The irony, then ...

Is that I became ...
on what was trying to avoid.

<i> That's Darth Vader. </ i>

<i> becomes precisely that
of what is protected. </ i>

You can see movies <i> War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> as autobiographies.

There are many parallels in the first ...

Where Luke Skywalker is ...
a lonely teenage ...

<i> craves leave ...
your planet Culver City. </ i>

Lucas may have had that nightmare
where it enters a tree ...

<i> ... and see that version of himself ... </ i>

<i> ... as Luke sees that version of himself
which became Vader. </ i>

Reality check, George.

<i> Yes, you turned this man.
For many fans ... </ i>

You ... Luke's version in the tree
which is in Vader mask.

I wonder if his son will kill him ...

And then make ...
his ghost apologize.

I will say one thing about George Lucas.

Regardless
weaknesses as a filmmaker ...

Deserves respect ...
because it is a giant ...

... In the history of cinema.

Perhaps we feel that it can not
do something other than this series.

Paramount wants another franchise it.

<i> Distributors War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> want more of this saga.

Much pressure to George Lucas
to make ...

Business ... because they are.

I still have something inside ...

... And can make another <i> American Graffiti </ i>,
<i> other THX </ i> ...

<i> ... And other Star Wars </ i>.

No way.
I think I could.

Must end with
<i> Wars </ i>.

I think George <i>
is a huge millionaire ... </ i>

<i> ... still has the soul
a hippie idealist. </ i>

And within that <i> hippie idealist ... </ i>

<i> alienated is a child ...
that used to go to the garage ... </ i>

<i> ... and working on engines
she felt she did not fit. </ i>

<i> And then it all gets
a giant corporation ... </ i>

<i> ... who grew up around it. </ i>

<i> And I think those four versions of it
fight it. </ i>

<i> I advocate for the little boy
that is in the middle. </ i>

I hope that at some point to achieve out
and make more movies.

No matter <i>
how many millions of dollars ... </ i>

<i> ... </ i> The Wars
<i> can generate ... </ i>

... And no matter how valuable is
the franchise ...

... Is not worth a tenth
of what it's worth as an artist ...

... And what you can do.

Why am I here in this quarry?

Why am I to George Lucas
personally?

The answer is simple,
and is the most important:

inspiration.

It inspired me to join YouTube,
and do what I like ...

... And be very good at what you know.

I think George Lucas
like a cluster of dreams.

You might think your dreams
all the time ...

... And I would
that share more with me.

Because I could not live ...

The fans have not deserted.

And I think that's the beauty
the world of the fans ...

... We can forgive.

<i> He gave us hours of fun. </ i>

One hundred percent.
It was a life of joy.

If I saw George Lucas, would give
a big hug and give thanks.

Finally, after all, is a human being.

A human being living
exceptional circumstances.

If you think none of us
has the great right ...

Complaining ... about three films
we do not like.

Because we gave these three films
that we will love forever.

Do we pay too much to go see
these three films?

Did he have something better
to do at 4:00 in the morning ...

... From the opening night of
<i> Episode II </ i>?

No.

I could have stayed home
playing video games in the series.

This conversation will never disappear.

When we are in nursing homes
discussing things ...

... Talk about what went wrong ...

<i> ... The Phantom Menace </ i>.

"Why not go well?
And Jar Jar Binks? "

Because that's the issue.

Hate goes hand in hand
with an immense love for these films.

Can not help it. I still want
