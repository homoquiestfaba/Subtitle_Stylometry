<i>Yeah, no, I can't talk right now.</i>

No, I just walked into my office.

I have a meeting. Yeah.

All right. No.

<i>Yeah. No. Listen, no no no. It's not okay.</i>

Okay, I don't care if he's in court.

I'll call you back. Yeah, all right.

Hey. Get over here.

It's good to see you on the outside.

Come on inside.

Yeah.
All right.

So, uh, can I get you anything?

No, I'm good for now.

Um, should we take care of business?

Let's see what you got.

Okay. Well, listen,
before we get into this,

I just want to tell you that, you know,

you've been away a long time and, uh...

<i>You know, quite a while.
Things have changed.</i>

So I heard.
<i>They have.</i>

Here's the status of your
three closest associates.

As you know, Satto Campione

and Richard D'Amato testified against you

and many other people that you know.

<i>They both got five years each</i>

<i>for their service to the government.</i>

And Dominic Salerno...

He died in prison of lung cancer.

What a shame,
that prick bastard hump cocksucker.

I figured you'd say that.

Listen, I know he's not one
of your favorite people,

but, uh, Dominic, Jr... He's still around.

Huh.
<i>He tried to follow in your footsteps,</i>

but he couldn't get the guys in
the neighborhood to support him.

You know, there's been some rumors

<i>that he's been cooperating
with the government,</i>

but I can't confirm that information.

Seems like he's got a, uh...

He's got some sort of a landscaping
business now, I believe.

Oh, good for him, little shit.

Yeah.

You know, Ben, I can't believe all of this,

I'm telling you.

Yeah. Listen, Joe,

I spoke to the U.S. attorney's office,

and I have a paper here that
I gotta go over with you.

And you gotta sign it,

<i>and you gotta understand
everything I'm about to tell you.</i>

<i>Okay? Here is a list</i>

of every known member in organized crime,

according to the F.B.I.,

that you cannot talk to,
meet, associate with,

<i>come in contact with in any shape,
way or form.</i>

<i>Do you understand what I'm
telling you here right now?</i>

I understand.

<i>Tell me this: What have I got left, Ben?</i>

Who am I gonna socialize with?

I was a boss.

I ran neighborhoods.
I had men working for me.

<i>The feds got me by the balls now.</i>

I don't know if I'm gonna make it out here.

I really don't. That's honest.

Look, I wish I could make this transition

easier for you, but I can't.

<i>Maybe you should spend a little
more time with your daughter,</i>

<i>get reacquainted, take care of your health.</i>

It's not the same out there anymore, Joe.

It's just not.

The F.B.I. Is smarter, stronger and tougher

than it's ever been.

I mean, guys that want to be in
the life today are fucking nuts.

They get locked up and
arrested within three years.

10 guys get pinched,
nine guys want to cooperate.

<i>It's a fuckin'
race to the government's doorstep.</i>

And all due respect, Joe...

Please don't take this the wrong way...

But you're not the same man
you were 20 years ago.

<i>The life you knew and
loved is gone forever.</i>

I know you a long time
and I care about you.

You're my friend.

But you gotta give it up. Its over, Joseph.

<i>You gotta listen to what I'm saying now.</i>

<i>It's done.</i>

Come on, sweetie.

Come on.

I'm coming.

Hey, guys! How are you?

Hey, Bobby, how you doing?
Good.

Hey, Liv. What's up?
Hi.

Hi, Michelle.
Hi.

So how's it being back?

Oh, it's good, yeah. Well, we'll talk.

Come on in. Hey, dad,

Bobby's here from next
door with his family.

They've come to kill you

with cannolis. Oh my God.

Just what he needs, frigging cannolis.

Oh, my God! Bobby!

<i>Hi.</i>

This is my wife Michelle.

What a<i> Bella.</i>

And this is Liv, my daughter.

Hello, Liv.
Hello.

Look what they brought you, dad.

Just what you need, some cannolis.

Put it on a plate and bring it out here.

Yeah, put it on a plate. Come with me.

We'll make some coffee.
We'll make some coffee.

You didn't have to do that.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

It's good to see you, Mr. Joe.

Been a lot of years.

Yeah.

Unbelievable.

It's good to see you.

You, too.
Yeah.

How's your family?
How's your mother and father?

They're good, they're great.

They moved down to Florida.

They retired.
Where'd they go?

Port St. Lucie.
Wow.

Got a little piece of property.

They built a house, so they're happy.

They told me to say hello.

Send them my love, will you?

I will, I will.

Jeez.
Yeah.

I can't believe you're...

I know, I know.

So what are you doing?

Ah, they left me the deli.

Keep it in the family.

Yeah, so I'm happy. It's fun.

There was two guys there.
They can't be there no more.

Vinnie and Anthony.
Oh, yeah, they're there.

Of course, they're a little older,
a little slower,

but they're there making sandwiches.
They're good.

What about carmine the bricklayer?
He's still there.

With the chair like this? He's still there?

Same thing.

We live in a time capsule over here.

Yeah, you should come say hello to them.

They'd love to see you.
I will. There's no doubt.

Yeah, everybody's happy you're back.

That's nice.
Yeah.

You know when I saw you last?

You were sitting like a king on his throne

in your '85 Camaro.

You wouldn't look left or right.

You'd just look straight ahead.

"Look at me, everybody. Look at my car."

Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

I remember the last time I saw you, too.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah yeah.

Come on, let's sit down and have some cannoli, huh?
All right.

Yeah.
Yeah.

<i>I had way too much sugar.</i>

Sugar breaks down the immune system.

Sugar, yeah. That I need to know, right.

Listen, you people be careful going home.

<i>All right, we will.</i>

Listen, like I said, if you need anything,

I'm either at the house or I'm at the deli,
all right?

Oh, yeah, he actually lives at the deli.

Try him there first.
Yeah, I'm easy to find there.

I will do that.
And it was very nice to see you.

Yeah, see you later.
All right, sweetie.

All right, Mr. Joe.
I'll walk you out.

The stoop's a little...
We need to fix that brick.

Good night, good night.
Thanks again, guys.

He looks old, right, sweetie?

Yeah. I feel bad for him.

I know.

But it's okay that I offered to, uh,

take him places and run errands for him

if I got the time, right?

Yeah, why? It's not like you're offering

to do anything illegal.

Just be careful, though.

Remember what happened to my Uncle.

Your Uncle Iggy was a made guy

who ran errands for a boss.

I run a family deli.

It's not... It's not as glamorous.

I know. I'm just saying.

It's just nuts to see him like that.

I mean, that guy was the shit, right?

He was, wasn't he?

Fuckin' Mr. Joe.

He was so awesome.

Yeah.

What does your dad think of him?

My dad? You know, they got along fine.

But my dad don't respect
that gangster shit.

No, he doesn't.

That's 'cause he's an old-school,
hard-working guy.

Yeah, but, you know, they were fine.

Yeah?

Your daughter's sleeping.

Is she?
Yeah.

I'm a lucky guy.

Mmm.

Listen, I want you to have the best day.

You take this.
Is everything in here?

Everything.
The gabagoul and the provolone?

Everything, and the deposit.
Okay.

I'll see you later. Angel, come with me.

Next week,
you're gonna stay home from school.

You'll be my assistant, I'll give you $5.

Okay.

Sweetheart.
You ready?

Hey, high-five, no?

Hey. Hey.
High-five.

Boom, boom, boom.

<i>Have the best day, all right, sweetheart?</i>

How's the old man doing?

His heart... It's messed up.

No good, no good.
No.

Bad heart, you gotta...
Bad shape.

All that shit we eat.
It is all the shit we eat.

It tastes good,
but it's so high in cholesterol and fat,

it's a wonder my heart hasn't exploded,

working here,
eating it all the time, especially.

I got relatives who lived
to be almost 100 years old.

Great-aunts and whatnot.

I don't know how they do it, honestly.

You get lucky.
Yeah.

That's it.
It's very sad, very sad.

Powerful guy like that.

Powerful... Used to be powerful.

Guy used to float when he walked.

You kidding me?

He was a piece of steel, this guy.

I feel bad. I feel bad.

What about a transplant?

Heart transplant? He's got no insurance.

In his line of work?

Yeah.

And how's he look? He looks old?

He looks old.
Not the same?

That's what tripped me out. He looks old.

Know what I mean? He's, like, an old man.

He's, like, an older guy.

You gotta take care of that.

You gotta take care of yourself,

because it catches up to you.

Let me tell you something.

That's why I'm here.

Every day, I walk from the house,

I'm here. Exercise. You're right.

Carmine, you live two minutes away.

There you go, breakin' balls again.

I'm saying, it's around the corner.

Hey, it's uphill, isn't it?

Oh, come on. You gotta do it more.

Do it 30, 40 times, then talk to me.

You gotta, like, join a gym,
do something like that.

Gym. You know when I went
to the gym that time?

You got a membership, right?

I don't go anymore.
I fell on the treadmill there.

<i>I end up on the floor.</i>

<i>They're all calling ambulances.</i>

<i>I just fell.</i>

I made a misstep. I'm...

No, gym is out.

Plus, it stinks there. I can't take it.

You know they knocked down Shea, right?

<i>I heard about that.</i>

<i>I didn't even know it when I was in jail.</i>

<i>I didn't even know it.</i>

Isn't that terrible?
<i>That's terrible.</i>

They knocked down fuckin' Shea stadium.

That's wrong.
<i>Shea stadium!</i>

It's wrong. Man.

I won't go to the new place.
I haven't been there yet.

<i>I don't blame you.</i>

Shea stadium.

Okay, nice, big breaths.

And give me one more.

I want to explain everything to you

so we both know what to
expect from each other.

That's good, doc.
Don't candy-coat nothin', all right?

Okay, good.

Let's face it... The federal government

doesn't take the best care of its inmates,

so I came in late in the game.

Hmm. I understand, doc.

And because of that,
there's only so much I can do.

What you have now is
advanced cardiomyopathy,

or heart muscle disease.

It's a type of progressive heart disease

where the heart is abnormally enlarged,

thickened or stiffened.

Your heart's ability
to pump blood is compromised,

and eventually it can lead
to heart failure...

Back-up of blood into the lungs

or the rest of your body.

So what you're telling me

is eventually I'm gonna die.

We all are.

That's very true, doc.

All we can do now is make
sure you stay on your meds,

do some light exercise,

try to go easy on foods that
are high in fats and starch.

Doc, I've been away for 20 years.

I got a few years left.
I'm gonna enjoy them, if you don't mind.

Fair enough,
but at least try to get some exercise.

I'm sure you have some catching up to do

and, uh, some ladies to chase.

Well, I tell you something,

before we go into that subject,

I gotta do like they do at N.A.S.A.

They find out if all
those systems are a-okay

before I open that silo,<i> capisce?</i>

Long time ago.

Gotcha. But you let me know.

I have some colleagues that can
help in that arena as well.

Oh!
You guys can do everything these days, huh?

Pretty much.

Mr. Scoleri, take care of yourself.

See you in about five or six weeks?

Yes. Thanks, doc.

What the fuck?

<i>Did they mention how long?</i>

<i>No, the doctor can't tell for sure,</i>

<i>but... he seems to be taking it well.</i>

What can he do, right?

Nothing. Nothing.

What is this, sweetie?

Oh, Mrs. Panepinto dropped this off.

You want some?
Yes, please.

All right.
A little bit.

Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

The doctor told him get some exercise,

rest when you can,
and he's got a bunch of pills

he's gotta take every day.

Unbelievable. You know,
I remember watching him and his crew

walk around on fresh pond road.

He was like a God.
I know, he was the man.

Yeah.
But not anymore.

Now he's just regular Joe citizen.

Yeah. That's messed up.

It's crazy, right?
Yeah, it's amazing.

<i>That's decaf, dad.</i>

<i>You're not hitting the real stuff</i>

<i>when I'm at work, right?</i>

Me? No, your honor.

<i>What am I gonna do with you?</i>

<i>I was watching this show on the
cooking channel the other day.</i>

They got a cooking channel?

Yeah, dad, they got cooking channels.

They got reality show channels,
fishing channels,

<i>they got channels, channels, channels.</i>

I heard that me and some of the guys

were actually on a documentary on T.V.
A couple of years ago.

<i>Where'd you hear that from?</i>

I heard it from one of the guys

when I was in.

Yeah, I heard about that, too.

Anyway, I was watching the cooking channel.

I love the cooking channel.

And I noticed when this Italian chef

was talking about the food,

he didn't drop his vowels the way we do.

What does that mean?

Well, he was saying "mozzarella,"

not "Moozzarell." You know.

Why do you think he was doing that?

That's easy.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

Dad, he's an Italian chef. He's from Italy.

We're Italian.
Only that's the way we say it over here.

That's how they say it in queens.
That's right, yeah.

<i>Where do we live? We live in queens.</i>

Yeah, we do. You're right, dad.

It's just that, you know, I've been...

Consciously working
on saying it the right way,

and it sounds a little uneducated.

No, I don't mean it like that, dad.

I just mean that I've been working on,

<i>you know, pronouncing things the right way.</i>

This way, when you go to the butcher
next time, he will understand you,

'cause he obviously doesn't
understand you now,

'cause you dropped your vowels.

Is that what you said you do?

No no, that's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I'm saying.

I don't know what to tell you.

Ahh.

It might be really nice

if you tell me that you love me.

<i>You haven't told me you love me once</i>

<i>since you've been home.</i>

I'm just saying.

That's what all this
talk about the food was?

To come to this?

No.

It's just that, you know, you were away

for a really long time,

<i>and we missed a lot of time.</i>

And it's just nice to hear sometimes,
that's all.

That's all.

Rita, I don't know. I'm not that guy.

I'm not a sentimental kind of guy.
I don't...

<i>I would think you would
take that for granted.</i>

It's... I know you love me, dad.

It's just, you know,

we missed a lot of time together.

You're home now.

You know, you're here now.

<i>It's just nice to hear sometimes.</i>

<i>I don't even know why I brought it up.</i>

<i>Silly.</i>

All right, now, Livvy, honey,

I'm gonna show you something...

How to really grow vegetables
that come beautiful.

All right? Take the vegetable

that you buy in the nursery.

Make a hole like this. That looks nice.

Put this in here like this.

Nice.

Then you scooch it around
over here like this.

See? Now, the trick is,

you gotta put manure.

What's manure?
Uh...

This stuff here.

All right. Right over there.

The nice thing about this is,

when mommy goes to the
store to buy the organic...

You know the organic?

Well, that's what this does.
This is organic.

You don't need all that other stuff.

And that's the whole secret.

Okay? So remember...

Over here, put this here.

Put it in, and put on the manure.

What's manure?

Uh...

Well, it's cow...

It's, uh...

It's a cow, uh...

Anyway, when you use it, see...

Here, here.

You put some on. Come on.

Okay, nice.

That's it, very good.

See?

That's the whole story.

See?

You still haven't told me what manure is.

Uh...

You know what? You know what?

Bobby.
What's up?

You know what you do, sweetheart?

You go ask daddy what it is.

He'll tell you all about it, all right?

Livvy's got a little question for you.

What's up, sweetheart?

What is it, sweetie?
Jeez.

I forgot how tough it is
to be around little girls.

Like with Rita. Gotta be careful.

It's not like a boy.

Or else they become a rough,
old, stupid old man like me.

All right. A little more cow shit.

Just a little bit.

There you go.

Nice and sweet.

Hey, Tony, how you doing?

Hey, what's up?
Hey, bobbo.

See that shot?
Forget about it.

It's crazy, right?

What's up, Vinnie? How you feeling?

All right. How you doing?

You good?
Yeah.

What's going on?

Can I talk to you in the back for a sec?

Yeah. What, are you all right?
Yeah.

Yeah, why are you looking at me like that?

You're flipping faces at me.
What's the problem?

Everything good at home?

Yeah, everything's great.
You sure?

Yeah, why are you acting weird? What's up?

I think you're acting weird.

What's the deal, man? What's up?

Some guys came looking for you earlier.

Hello?
I see. F.B.I.?

Yeah. They're looking for you.

A big guy and another guy.
Are you serious?

Yeah, two guys...
a black guy and a white guy.

What did you tell them?

I didn't say nothin',
'cause I don't know what to say,

'cause you're not telling me something,

and maybe you need to tell me
something I don't know about.

Nothing's going on. Nothing is going on.
Maybe something's going on.

No, Vinnie, nothing's going on.

Maybe something's going on.
Just shut up. There's nothing going on.

When did this happen?
Today.

Maybe something's going on
you're not telling me about.

You need to tell me,
so when these guys come looking for me,

I'm not a jerk-off.
Don't. Stop.

I'm sitting here with my dick in my hand.

They ask for my name?
Yeah.

No, they asked for my name. They asked...

Hey, Anthony.

Hey, Dommo, how you doing?

Good. How are you?

All right. How's the family?

Good. Everybody's the same.

How's your kids?
Everybody's good. Everybody's good.

Good, good. So, uh...

Bobby around?

Yeah, he's in the back.

Yeah? There he is.

Oh!

Hey.
Hey.

What's up, Dominic?
How you doing, Bobby?

Good, how's it going?
Good, good. You?

You know, staying busy.

Yeah, that's what I hear.

What do you hear?

What, are you getting defensive?

No.

I don't know.
You seem a little offended by me.

No, not at all, Dominic.

You sure?
Yes, what's going on?

Whew. That's good to knew.

So could you do me a favor, then?

What is it?

Could you let your neighbor know

that I send him my absolute best?

Yeah. Sure.

Is that all?

Could you also let him know

that I'd like to have
a cup of coffee with him?

No, that's not gonna happen.

What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

There's no underlying point to
my response to you, Dominic,

except for I'm not gonna
tell him anything more

than "hi, how are you?
I hope you're well." That's it.

Who died and left you a pair of balls, huh?

Dominic, cut the bullshit.

He's an old man, he just came back.

He's not feeling good.

He's not supposed to talk to or associate

with anybody who could
get him into trouble.

You know the fuckin' drill, right?

You know what I like about you, Bobby?

Go ahead.

You're still one of the good kids.

You never got in trouble,

you kept your nose clean,
never got caught up with us.

But... just watch your fuckin' mouth

and don't forget who you're fuckin'
talking to.

<i>Capisce?</i>

You done?

Yeah, I'm done.

All right.

Have a good day, all right?

You, too. Take care.

Gents. Keep her clean.

Fucking guy.

<i>Should've smacked him in the fuckin' teeth.</i>

<i>Prick.</i>

Thank you.

Yeah.

Hey.
<i>Hey, Bobby.</i>

How are you?
<i>Good.</i>

I want you to meet my parole guy,
officer Ramirez.

This is Bobby, my next-door neighbor.

Nice to meet you.

Federal probation, not parole.

You keeping this guy out of trouble?

I'm trying, I'm trying.
It gets hard, but he's good.

What trying? My days are numbered, pal.

Yeah, well, I got a feeling

that you'd give me a run
for my money if you could.

Back in the day.

Not no more now. I got a bum ticker.

Every day I get up, that's a blessing.

Well, I'll see you next week, Mr. Scoleri.

I'll be waiting.
Nice meeting you, Bobby.

Nice to meet you, too.

Oh, just as a formality,
I just need your last name.

Dibianco.

You don't look like a dibianco.

I know, I get that all the time.

Why do you ask?

We just like to know who
he's associating with.

He's... he's good. He's good.

<i>I know him before he was born.</i>

I know his father. It's a good family.

Stand-up guy, his father. Hard worker.

No need to explain.
Been here my whole life.

I understand. See you guys.
No problem.

Take care.
Have a good day.

Thank you. What's up, Bobby?

How you feeling? You good?

Eh.

Listen, I'm gonna go for
a walk in the park.

You want to come get some exercise?

It's too cold. I'm not in the mood.

All right.

Listen, I, uh...

I don't know if I'm
supposed to mention this,

or even if you care, but Dom Salerno, Jr...

<i>He came into the deli.</i>

He sends his regards and says hello.

Do me a favor.

Don't ever mention that
motherfucker's name again.

Not ever. Not to me, not ever.

I... I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you.

Bobby, do me a favor. Leave me be today.

It's all right. All right?

All right, I'll... I'll see you later.

<i>Hmm. This health insurance company</i>

is just so screwed up.

People are getting denied coverage

that used to be entitled to it.

How anything gets done,

I have no idea, dad.

I heard that if we lived in Europe,

I could get a new heart, no problem,

no cost, no nothin'.

Not here, dad.

Not in the richest country in the world.

Yeah, well... maybe this president of ours

could throw a couple of ideas our way.

I'm not gonna hold my breath.

Let me ask you something.

Hmm?

How's the boyfriend situation?

Am I gonna see some grandkids,

or am I gonna go to my
death without hearing,

"grandpa! Hi, grandpa!"

Dad, come on, stop.

Sometimes I think I'm paying a debt

from something I did in some other life.

You're getting all spiritual now.

No, I'm just saying it ain't easy.

I know it's not, dad. But you know what?

You lived life to the fullest,
and you know you did.

And in another time,
you wouldn't have gone away.

But it's different nowadays.

That's what I heard.

Where's the fuckin' loyalty?

I'm sorry. Pardon my French.

Yeah, nobody came around
when you were gone,

not that I needed anything.

The important thing is I'm back here.

Give credit to the feds.

They made me go home and die in my own bed.

Credit to them, the mutts.

Dad, don't say that, okay?

I'm sorry.

I want to ask you a question, dad,

and it's hypothetical,
so I don't want you to panic.

Go ahead.

What would you do if you had a son...

I don't have a son.

Let me finish.

What would you do if you had a son

and he was gay?

What, a fag?<i> Madon.</i>

I'd kill the little bastard.

Why, dad?
He's a human being like everybody else.

No, that's not a human
being like everybody else.

They take it you-know-where.

No, that's not natural. That's a homo.

So being gay means you automatically
take it in the you-know-where?

Yeah. Listen to me, honey, okay?

It's not natural.

I don't have a son, but if I did,

I would raise him to be a man.

It's when you mollycoddle them,

that's when they come out that way.

Dad, it's got nothing to do

with whether you raise
him like a man or not.

Could we talk about something else?

I don't have a son.
This doesn't pertain to me

'cause I don't have a son.

And I'm getting agita from this, all right?

Well, you have a daughter.

Yeah? And?

What if I told you I was gay?

What?! Get out!

What are you giving me this crap for?

What the hell are you talking about?

Ridiculous.
I'm just saying, what if?

What if what?
What, are you telling me you're a dyke?

No, dad. I'm...

I'm saying...

I'm saying that I'm gay.

You're not.

Yeah, dad. I am.

Seriously. I'm gay.

What did I do? I know I've done
a lot of bad things in my life,

but I paid for that.
But what did I do to you?

No no no, dad. Listen to me.

Listen to me, please.

You didn't do anything okay?

It's just the way I am. It's...

It's... the way I came out.

I've always been attracted to women.

Come on, dad. I'm 43 years old,

and I've never been married.
What did you think?

What about Artie from St. Mary's?

Who? From where?
Artie. St. Mary's.

Oh my God. Artie?

Dad, Artie... he's a
hairdresser in the city.

What did...

I mean, this... I'm speechless.

I... we're gonna get through
this together, okay?

We're gonna get through this, all right?

Just don't you worry about it.

What are we gonna get through, dad?

They got pills for this.

They got... They must have pills.

They got pills to make your hair grow.

They got pills to make your eyelashes grow.

I saw it.

I don't want any pills, dad.

Well, maybe you could get some therapy,

go to a psych guy, you know?

I don't want any therapy, dad.

I don't want a psych guy.

I'm really happy with who
I am and who I'm with.

Who are you... who?

I was living with my girlfriend

for a while, dad, before you came home.

Where?

What's the difference?

Living in my house with a dyke?

Dad, nobody cares.

Yeah, they care.

What the hell are you talking about?

Ohh, wow.

Jeez!

Maybe I should just drop fuckin'
dead right now.

You know what, dad? Stop, all right?
Please.

Please stop.

I am speechless.

So will you meet her for dinner?

What are you talking about?

How can you say things like...

How can you say that to me?

Meet her for dinner? With you and a dyke?

God.

Nice.

You know what, dad?

You don't know anything about her.

You don't even... you
know nothing about me.

You left me 20 years ago

because of the choices
you made in your life.

Wait a minute. That's out of line.

Oh, I'm out of line?
Yeah.

You just called my girlfriend a dyke,
and I'm out of line?

I have news for you, dad.

I haven't lived in your house

for almost 15 years.

I've been living in the city

in my apartment with my girlfriend.

<i>I only came back to queens</i>

<i>so that you would feel like
you hadn't missed anything,</i>

<i>and because I love you so much.</i>

And right now I am regretting

every second of that decision.

Sweetheart, I...

Don't.

Don't, dad, please. Don't "sweetheart" me.

You know what? I know that I'm not the son

<i>that you always wanted,</i>

<i>and I'm really okay with that, dad.</i>

And there's one more thing.

My mother...

I found her. Do you remember her?

<i>Thanks for lying to me
about her being dead.</i>

Jesus, dad, didn't you
think that I would...

That I would ever be curious

as to why I never knew my mother

or I didn't know anything about her?

I mean, why? Why would you do that to me?

<i>She's a beautiful woman,
with her issues and all.</i>

<i>So what is it, dad?</i>

What, are you embarrassed?

Are you embarrassed that your daughter

is not all Italian?

I'm sorry, dad. I'm really sorry.

But the way you feel right now

<i>is how you made me feel.</i>

You see if they got a pill for that.

Oh, come on, Rita.

Jesus Christ.

Can I help you?

You Bobby dibianco?
Yeah.

I'm special agent O'Bannon.

This is special agent Butler, F.B.I.

Mind if we ask you a few questions?

Sure.

Can... can we do it outside?

My family's in here.

Absolutely.
No problem.

After you.

You know, you look more like
a Connor that a dibianco.

Yeah, I get that all the time.

Uh, it's my mother's maiden name.

Yeah, we know. We did our homework.

We're with the organized crime task force

out of the B.Q. Office.

Right, I got the card
from my employee the other day.

That was you guys, right?
Yeah, yeah.

How well do you know Joseph Scoleri?

God, he's been my neighbor
since before I was born.

And, you know, he just came back,

as I'm sure you guys know.

And, uh, I'm just trying to do

what a lot of us do in this area,

which is help out, you know? Neighborly.

Well, we just noticed

that you've been spending a
lot of time with him lately,

and we wanted to make
sure that you understand

who you're dealing with.

No, I know all about Mr. Scoleri,

and I know about everything that went down,

so I understand, you know.

But the reality is...

He's just an old man with nobody around

except for his daughter, who's working
all the time just to keep the lights on.

So I'm just trying to...
Help out. That's all.

Yeah, you're quite the neighbor.
Just make sure

<i>it doesn't go any further than that.</i>

Is that it?

Thank you very much for your time.

<i>Hey, Mr. dibianco?</i>

Bobby.
Bobby, right, right.

He's a dying breed, you know?

Not really worth getting in trouble for.

You have a lot to lose. If I were you,

<i>I'd keep my distance.</i>

Besides, you know they only sent him home

because he's dying soon, right?

That's really nice of the
federal penitentiary system.

I'll make sure to tell Mr. Joe and
his daughter you guys said that.

Mr. Joe. Right, right.

That's important around here.

You take care of yourself.

What are you doing?

Everything's all right.

Hello?

Happy Birthday!

Happy Birthday, baby.
Thank you.

You're welcome.
Thank you.

Happy Birthday, Bobby.

Thank you, thank you.

Surprised to see you here.

Hey,
two beautiful girls asked me to come over.

As my mother would say.

All right, you guys want to have some cake?

Yeah, yeah.
It's good to see you.

Thank you, little girl.

So you're not actually from queens?

No no. Bronx-bred.
No no. It was lighter then,

if you know what I'm talking about.
Right, right.

Okay, now I want to play 50 questions.

Please.
Okay.

<i>So what was your first job?</i>

Ohh. Cleaning up the fish guts

at the Fulton fish market.

Wow.
Worst job in the world.

I mean, the smell... I
can still remember it.

I remember that it gave me the feeling

I gotta do something else.

And that led me down the wrong path,

but it led me on a different path.

Sure.
I wanted to get out of there

the first five minutes I was there,

but I couldn't quit.
My father was a hard-ass.

I'm sorry. Uh...
It's okay.

<i>It ain't the first time she's heard it.</i>

She heard it before. Don't worry about it.

The fact of the matter,

he was a very hard-working man,

like your father. Same thing.

I appreciate that, thank you.

<i>No, it's the truth.</i>

Yeah, just like him.
Yeah.

I have a question.
Yes, honey.

My friend at school told me
that you used to be a gangster.

Oh, that's not appropriate...

Whoa, who... Who said that? Huh?

But you want to know something?

That is not a question.

Thank you, Bobby.

All right, Mr. Joe.

Thanks for coming, all right?

Listen, Bobby, the other day,
when you asked me...

Don't worry about it.
Yeah?

Don't worry about it.
All right.

You got a beautiful family.

<i>Thank you. I know, I'm lucky.</i>

I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

If you need anything, let me know, okay?

I will do that.
All right.

Get home safe.

Thanks, Bo...
Oh, I'm kidding.

Yeah. It's worth repeating.

Okay.

Gee, where do I live?

Have a good night, all right, Mr. Joe?

Yeah, thanks.

<i>â™ª I have often walked... â™ª</i>

Here you go.
See you guys later, all right?

Thank you.

<i>â™ª Several stories high â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª knowing I'm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª on the street where you live... â™ª</i>

You're used to this by now.

I'm afraid that's all there is today.

That will do.

Thank you.

Here.

I hope all the crack I've been smoking

don't show up.
Funny.

You're good.
Hey, would you mind taking that with you?

This?

Come on, let's go.

You're comfortable.
You look very comfortable.

You're well-adjusted.

How's it going?

Not bad.

You're still seeing Dr. Shapiro regularly?

I am.

I got a call from an F.B.I.
Agent... O'Bannon...

From the New York office.

That's nice. Give him my regards.

You're really clear on who you can

and can't associate with, right?

Crystal clear.

How's your neighbor?

Bobby dibianco?

Very nice person. Very nice family.

I hear he takes great pride

in looking after you.

Yes, he does.

That's what we do. It's a Sicilian thing.

Your people do that?

My people?
<i>Yeah.</i>

Do what?

Take care of each other.

Who are you referring to?

People taking care of people.

Neighbors.

Like a community.

<i>A village.</i>

I'll see you next week.

Wait a minute. I thought
we were on monthly.

No. That's my call.

We're on weekly.

Fuckin' mutt.

Hold on, I'm coming.

Hi. Mr. Scoleri?
Yeah.

Uh, I'm Anna, one of Rita's friends.

Hi, Anna.
It's so nice to meet you.

You, too.
Rita's caught up at work,

so she asked me to come pick you up

and take you to your doctor's appointment.

Oh. What a pleasant surprise.

I never expected such a beautiful girl

to come and take me anywhere today.

Why, thank you.

I'll go wherever you tell me.

Ha! You're a flirt, aren't you?
A little bit.

I'll be right back.

Gotta get my coat.
Okay.

I've got an umbrella.

You're not going anywhere.
No.

Waiting right here for you.

Mr. Joe?

<i>Come on in, it's open.</i>

How you feeling? You all right?

<i>Yeah.</i>

I got some vegetables.

Thanks.
And fruit and, uh...

<i>Some milk.</i>

Thanks, Bobby.

Hey, Bobby,
you understand this thing over here?

<i>What's that?</i>

I can't get this thing to work.

<i>What's that? A C.D.?</i>

Yeah, that's a C.D.
Yeah, I got it.

We had cassettes in my time.

We didn't have this over here.

You just put it in and press the button.

This, I don't understand it.

Yeah, well...

You go like this.

Then you just press play.

It turns on.
Huh.

This.

Huh, look at that.

That's fancy.

Ah.
There you go.

<i>Goes around so fast.</i>

<i>What's that music, huh?</i>

<i>The guy... Victor...</i>

He turned me onto this when I was away.

It's got something to it.
It holds my attention.

Huh?

I like it.

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>See, what happened is,</i>

there was these guys back in Cuba

in the '40s and the '50s,

like that.

They, um...

They were superstars.

And these guys, a couple of years ago,

went down to Cuba and got
these guys together,

and they made a record.

<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

And so this is the record over here.

It's really... I don't know what it is.

I don't know why it gets me like that.

No, it's good. It's like, uh...

It's authentic.

It sounds genuine.
<i>Yeah yeah.</i>

This here record was made a few years ago,

but it sounds like it was made

just, uh, back in the '50s.

Has that feel, you know?

<i>Just has that thing.</i>

Yeah, it's good. It's, uh...

It's authentic. I like it.

I mean... it's good.

<i>Yeah.</i>

So, Bobby...

What do you remember about me?

What do you mean?

You know what I mean.

I don't know. I mean, I was
just a kid when you went away.

I used to hear more things after you left

than when you were around.

But, I mean, you were like a hero to us.

<i>We all loved you.
We all wanted to be like you,</i>

<i>dress like you and have a car like Mr. Joe.</i>

I mean, even me. Everybody.

We all loved you. We still do.

Everybody's glad you're back, you know?

That's nice to hear, Bobby,

but I'm just an old man now

with a heart that don't work

and a dyke for a daughter...

<i>And a parole officer spic</i>

who comes around here
and takes great pleasure

in busting my fuckin 'balls.

<i>Spic cocksucker.</i>
Oh, come on.

The "old" part is right.

Hey, watch it.

What happened?
Something happen with you and, uh...

You and Rita?

Yeah. We had an argument.

When she told me that she was a lesbian,

<i>that she had a girlfriend.</i>

You know anything about that?

Mr. Joe, with all due respect, I, uh...

I try to mind my business,

and I want people to mind their business.

She's my neighbor, I love her,

I known her my whole life. But, you know...

I stay out of everybody's way, you know?

Hmm. It's a good attitude, Bobby.

<i>You'd have made a good wiseguy.</i>

Well, you know,
kids aren't afraid to tell anything.

When I was a kid,

if I got a bad mark on a report card,

I was afraid I was getting
a fuckin' beating

from my mother and my
father when he got home.

I know, I know. I remember.
I had the same thing.

<i>Today the kids don't...
they're not afraid of anything.</i>

"Daddy, I got a... I shoot heroin.

Daddy, I'm a fag.
Daddy, I gotta have a sex change,

psychotherapy...
" what the fuck happened here?

What happened to these fuckin' kids?

There's nothin'...
what happened to these fuckin' kids?

Yeah, it's all fucked up.
There's no more filters.

There's no more respect.

None. It's crazy. It's changed.

<i>It's nuts.</i>

Yeah.

The world's going to shit. I got nothin'.

My life is a mess. I got a...

No wife, no money.

<i>I'm sick.</i>

<i>I can't go nowhere 'cause I got no license.</i>

I can't get no license.

The feds took 7,481 days out of my life.

Shit.

<i>They should've just let me die there.</i>

No. Come on, don't say that.

<i>Would've been better, Bobby.</i>

No, come on.

Bobby, I can't make it out here.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I just feel that, uh...

I can't function right.

<i>I'm not the same man.</i>

And something happened.
Maybe prison softened me up,

I don't know, but I...

I'm reflecting on a lot of shit that I did.

A lot of shit.

And I don't, uh...

<i>I don't know how to come to terms with it,</i>

<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

But the worst thing I done, see...

I lied to my daughter.

I told her her mother was dead.

<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

<i>Her mother was a drug addict,</i>

<i>so I wanted to keep them apart, you know.</i>

But I deprived my daughter...

Of the image of her mother.

How's she gonna be a woman

without the image of her mother?

And I did that.

Maybe that's why she went gay.

No, that's not true.

<i>I don't know.</i>

My daughter.

My little baby daughter.

That's the worst thing I ever done.

<i>â™ª Baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I could've smiled,
but I chose to cry instead, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª like the water, unimproved, so blue...
â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I don't know what to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª don't know which way to go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª don't know what do do,
sad songs on the radio... â™ª</i>

Mr. dibianco,

could you step out of
the car for us, please?

Sure.

You guys can just call me Bobby.

<i>- All right, got it.
You got it.</i>

Officers Butler and O'Bannon, right?

Agent.
Agent.

Sorry.

How are we doing today?

We're doing good.
Yeah?

How can I help you?
Things are good?

Everything's just fine.
Just taking care of some errands.

Good.
We just happened to be in the neighborhood

and wanted to ask a few questions.

Okay.
Maybe you've got some extra information

on our good friend Mr. Scoleri,

who he's been talking to.

Uh...
Forgive me... Mr. Joe.

No, I don't have any new
information on him.

Just the same old stuff. But, I mean,

you guys can't keep harassing me

just because I'm friends
with someone you're looking 'at.

We're talking about an old man,
a harmless old man.

He's dying.
You sent him home for that, right?

Butler was being insensitive.

Didn't mean anything by it.

He was raised in an... Alternate household.

Okay.

Listen, I've had one question

going on in my mind for a while,

and I'm glad I got the
opportunity to ask you.

What is it?

Why is it that your people...
my people?

Yeah. Your people are okay

with Mr. Scoleri reaching
his hand into their pockets

and bleeding these
mom-and-pop businesses dry

while he got fat.

Not to mention the beatings,
the intimidation,

the occasional murder.

I don't know what to tell you.

My family never had that problem.

Hmm.
Wonder why that is.

What do you mean? What are you insinuating?

Nothin'.

Okay. All right.
<i>- Yeah, forget it.</i>

Okay, this is a nice neighborhood, right?

You look around this neighborhood.

You don't see any drug-dealers
around any corners.

Nobody's getting their houses broken into.

That's partially because
of guys like Mr. Scoleri.

There's a certain amount of respect

that they bring to the neighborhood.

Maybe you guys are in the wrong place.

Maybe you're in the wrong neighborhood.

So we should be in the black
and Latino neighborhoods?

I didn't say that. Did I say that?

Sound like it.
Yeah, I think you insinuated it.

I wasn't insinuating anything.

Well, this has been an educational

and inspiring conversation.

I appreciate your time.

So we're all done?

We're done here for today.

I'm gonna let you know something.

If you guys keep harassing me,
I'm telling you,

I'm gonna file a civil suit.

I appreciate that warning.

'Cause so far, you guys are 0-for-2.

Good luck.
All right.

We're swinging for the fences.
All right.

Next time, if you want to just say hello,

just say hello.
We don't even have to stop the car.

<i>Have a good day.</i>

Mr. Joe.

Hey, Bobby! How are you, young fellow?

The question is, how are you?
What's going on?

I'm fine. I'm making the gravy.

Oh, yeah? Looks like you're making a sauce.

No, it's not a sauce. It's a gravy.

No, no, no, no. That's a sauce for pasta.

Yeah. That's a gravy for macaroni.

You know what I call you guys?

I call you "yuppie Italians."

Oh, oh, oh! With the yuppies.

I'm saying that's a sauce you put on pasta,
right?

Very nice. Let me explain
to you what it is.

What do you got in there?
So you learn something.

What is it?
You can do it in your deli.

Look, I brown the meat.
This is beef, pork and veal.

I browned it in olive oil.

But it's gotta be not extra virgin,

'cause extra virgin gets bitter.

So you use regular imported nice olive oil.

Right.
And now...

We browned it, we take it out.

The flavor of the oil

is coming from the meat.

Now you add a couple of handfuls
of nice chopped onions.

You see? Nice. Beautiful.

The meat...

Has imbued its flavor into the olive oil.

Right. Imbued.

That's a good word, isn't it?
Imbued.

And you let them stay
there on a small flame.

And you let them caramelize.

You know what "caramelize" is, right?

I know what it is.

All right, now, when that's finished,

you put a little basil,
too, right in there.

I like to even cook it from there.
Mm-hmm.

Then I'm gonna put in the tomatoes,

which I will crush with my hands.

All right. Make sure you wash your hands.

Little bastard.

A little salt and pepper.

I'm gonna make sure
I have it on a nice simmer

so it goes, "plop, plop, plop, plop."

And that's it.
You don't put nothing else in it.

That's the only ingredients.
No garlic, no sugar. No.

And it's done. Nice.

The best thing you ever ate in your life.

And it is not called a sauce.

It's a gravy.

Well, whatever it is,
it smells like a good sauce.

Pain in the ass.

<i>How you feeling? You all right?</i>

I feel good.

Bobby, I gotta ask you a favor.
All right, what is it?

<i>I gotta reach out to some
old friends of mine,</i>

<i>if you know what I'm talking about.</i>

There's a guy name of Louie Lapresa

from forest Avenue, the bakery.

<i>Is he still around?</i>

Yeah, I see him.
I know who you're talking 'about.

<i>Yeah. All right.</i>
I... he's around.

See, I have to have a sit-down

with some of these guys
who are still around.

I want to ask you to go pass...

Oh, no, Mr. Joe. I, uh...

I don't feel comfortable doing that.

I don't want to talk to Lapresa.

What are you talking about?

You don't even know what
I was gonna ask you.

Yeah, but I think I do, and...

Not for nothing, I mean, I can't...

You'd go to jail just for
speaking to those guys, right?

Fuck jail.

I just did 20 years. 20.

I could do another 20 standing on my head.

They're never gonna kill this thing.

Well, that's fine, you know.

You might not be scared of jail,

but I am, Mr. Joe.

That's... That's not for me.

I can't do that.

I got a family.

Let me ask you a question.

Do you think you can be half-pregnant?

Is that what you think?

Look, I... I'm not gonna do that.

I can't do that, Mr. Joe.

I mean, taking you to the grocery
store and to the doctor...

That's fine.
But I'm not gonna pass along any messages

<i>or talk to somebody that's
gonna get me in trouble,</i>

<i>or you in trouble, for that matter.
I can't do that.</i>

You know I got a guy following me

in an unmarked car every now and then?

And the fuckin' F.B.I...
They showed up at my house...

<i>And at the job...</i>

<i>Asking me all kinds of crazy shit.</i>

<i>I'm just... I'm a working guy.</i>

<i>I don't do that stuff.</i>

What fuckin' F.B.I.?!

What guys are following you?

Are you a fuckin' rat now? Is that it?

You got nothing on me!

This is getting weird, Mr. Joe.

I gotta... I gotta go.

Don't you walk away from me

<i>when I'm talking!</i>

<i>Don't you disrespect me!</i>

You forgot who you're talking to, right?

I'm a fuckin' legend in this neighborhood!

No, you were a legend! You're not a legend.

You're just an old guy with a bad heart.

<i>You can't talk to me like that.
We're friends.</i>

<i>I don't need this shit.
I got a family, Mr. Joe.</i>

I'm not gonna stand here
and let you scream at me.

I gotta go.

Have a good one.

Yeah, you go! You get out of my house!

Don't you ever fuckin' come back!

You're dead to me!

Fuckin' mutt!

Fucking guy.

<i>Grant that we may possess
the gift of charity</i>

<i>for which you have taught us to hope</i>

<i>through Christ our lord.</i>

Please stand and let us pray.

The lord be with you.

And with your spirit.

<i>May almighty God bless you,</i>

<i>the father and the son and the holy spirit.</i>

Amen.

Our mass is over now.

Let us go in peace to love

and to serve the lord.

Thanks be to God.

Oh, hey. How's it going?
Good. How are you doing?

Good.
Good to see you.

Oh, Liv, you're beautiful.

When I grow up, I want
to look just like you.

Thank you.

What's going on? How's your dad?

He's miserable. You know, he's a tough guy.

<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

He misses you coming around, you know.

I don't know. Tell him I said hello.

I'm gonna make him call you.
All right.

When he's ready.

No big deal.
All right.

So what are you doing today?

The usual... my mother's for Sunday dinner.

Sounds nice.
We eat like pigs.

Pigs, yeah. I wish I could come,

but I gotta go or the old
man's gonna blow a gasket.

So I'll see you later.

Bye, sweetie. Nice to see you.

Have a good day.
We'll talk later.

Bye.

<i>- You remember?
I remember it.</i>

<i>It was live.
I remember it 'cause it was live.</i>

<i>He comes running up with the camera...
Geraldo?</i>

Yeah. And he says to fat Tony,

with his cigar in his mouth...

He goes, "what do you got to say, Tony?"

"What do I gotta say? Go fuck yourself."

Hello, boys.
Hey, look who's...

Mr. Joe.
Mr. Joe, how are you?

How are you?

Hello.
Hey, Vinnie, carmine.

Good to see you.
You, too. Anthony.

<i>How are things at home, carmine?</i>

Everybody's good. I got my son,

his wife, the kids.
They bought a house on long island.

My daughter just had a baby.

Me and the wife,
we're still stuck in the neighborhood.

We love it here.
Hey, we're still slaving for Bobby.

Yeah, busting our humps
for Bobby over here.

How about yourself? You look great.

One day at a time, Vinnie.

Some days chickens, some days feathers.

But I... One day at a time.

True, true.
All right. Anyway...

Give my love at home.

Let me get this for you.

All right.
Absolutely.

Wow.

Look at him.

No no no, don't worry about it.

I insist.
No, it's only $1.

It says $1.99.

It's half-off day.

<i>Take care of your health, yeah?</i>

Stay well, Mr. Joe.

Okay.
Thanks for stopping in.

What?
There was something...

Something going on over there?

So, what, are you breakin' balls? Huh?

Little ball-breaker? Look at this guy.

He's the president of the ball-breakers.

B.B.U.
B.B.U.

Skinny Vinnie the Guinea.
Skinny Vinnie.

You guys have a little relationship...

You guys mind your business.
Little troubles?

A little girl fight?

Shut your mouth.

No respect.

Dad, I'm home.

Hey. Hey, dad. How was your day?

Good.

What's this?

They're flowers.

For who?
You.

From who?
Me.

For me?
Yes.

From you?
Yes.

Would you read the card?

I, uh...

I'm no good at this.

And, uh...

I have to apologize to you

because of what I did

in telling you that your mother was dead.

It was a stupid mistake.

I knew at that time that you and she...

She shouldn't be near you

because of the problems
that she was going through.

But it was stupid of me
to tell you she was dead,

and I'm very sorry. I was wrong.

Now, about the other day in the park.

The things that I said about you...

And the things that I said
about your girlfriend...

I don't know if you could ever believe me,

if you could ever find it in your heart

to forgive me.

But if you could,

I would be so completely honored

to go to a restaurant

with you and your girlfriend

if I could still be invited.

Yeah. Yeah, dad.

You're still invited.

I love you, daddy.

I love you.

Yeah.

Did you make dinner for me or what?

Well, naturally.

Bobby?

Hello?

<i>Hey, Michelle, it's Rita.</i>

Hey, Rita, how's your dad?

<i>He's hanging in there.</i>
Oh, good.

<i>I have a huge favor for Bobby.</i>

<i>Okay, what do you need?</i>

<i>I'm stuck at work right now.</i>

<i>I'm done, but by the time I leave,
I'm gonna get back late,</i>

<i>and I really need him
to take my dad to the doctor.</i>

<i>This is an important one.</i>

<i>Yeah, sure, that should be no problem.</i>

<i>I'll call you back if there's a problem,</i>

<i>but it should be fine.</i>

<i>Thank you so much. I owe you.</i>

<i>You're welcome. Talk to you later.</i>

<i>- Bye.
Bye.</i>

<i>Joe!</i>

Mr. Joe!

You broke into my house.
I'm calling the cops.

I didn't break in.
You don't hear me banging on the door?

You better get out. I'm
gonna call the cops.

All right, call the cops. I'm sure
they're gonna rush over here for you.

How you feeling? You all right?

I feel 100%.
<i>You good?</i>

All right, Rita called,
said you got a doctor's appointment,

so I'm gonna take you today, okay?

I'll die before I get in a car with you.

You're not gonna come with me?

You're not gonna get in the car with me?

Look, I'm your neighbor.
I'm not going anywhere.

Come on, Mr. Joe. You can't be mad at me.

You're acting like a big baby.

A big, giant Italian baby.

Keep it up. Keep disrespecting me.
Keep it up.

<i>You're not gonna come with me?</i>

All right, I'm gonna wait
downstairs until you're ready,

and if you don't show up,
they're gonna charge you,

<i>so we gotta go.</i>

Come on.
You can't be mad at me forever, all right?

Let's go. We gotta go.

I'm gonna be waiting downstairs.

Sunny day.

Time to get moving.

Everybody loves the sunshine.

A beautiful day in the neighborhood.

Come on!

Don't... stop...

Stop honking the fuckin' horn!

Mr. Joe!

All the frigging honking.

You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.

Can I please take you to the doctor?

We're not going anywhere.

My daughter's coming to pick me up.

No, she's not.
Yes, she is.

I just called...
I just spoke to her.

She's not coming.
What's the difference?

I'm not getting in the car with no rat.

Are you being serious?
You're a rat.

You know you're a rat.

How am I a rat? Look, Mr. Joe,

come on, I took off of work to take you.

We gotta go.

All right, but not another fuckin' word.

No words.

All right? Come on, let me help you down.

I am not an invalid.
All right.

I don't believe this fuckin' guy.

<i>Let me get the door.</i>

Get away from that door.

<i>I won't get the fuckin' door.</i>

<i>Pain in the ass, this fuckin' guy.</i>

Unbelievable.

<i>Vaffanculo!</i>

You don't open the frigging door?
What's the matter with you?

Don't know how to operate a fuckin'
automobile?

You good? All right.

Get your seat belt.

Get outta here!

You don't have to wait with me.

Yeah, I know.

So what are you still doing here?

Rita asked me to stay here so
I could tell her what the doctor says.

I can tell her.
She just wanted to make sure

<i>you don't forget any details.</i>

You kids. I'm telling you.

Are you incapable of
apologizing for something?

I am not incapable of anything.

You tell me what I'm supposed
to apologize for, okay?

Tell me that.
For what happened the other day.

Do you think I'm gonna think less of you

or people will think less
of you if you say sorry?

Come on, Bobby.
You think I really give a shit

about what people think about me anymore?

Yeah, I do. I do think that.

Can I just have a second, please?

I do think you care what people think.

And that's okay. That's normal.

It's normal. So now you're a psychiatrist?

No, I'm just... I'm
trying to be your friend.

Jesus.

You know why I said no to
you a few weeks ago, right?

It's because I'm not getting in trouble

for passing along a stupid message for you.

<i>And you shouldn't want to
risk going back to jail</i>

<i>for sending a message.</i>

<i>That's crazy.</i>

Hello?

You know, I don't have to be here.

I don't need to be
doing these things for you.

I have other things I could be doing.

<i>I have a family. I have a daughter.</i>

<i>I'm doing it because I want to,</i>

<i>not because I have to.</i>

<i>'Cause I like you.</i>

<i>But you're not my boss.</i>

You know that, right?

Those days are over for you.

Got me driving around here like I'm crazy.

<i>And you scream at me?</i>

Are you hearing me? Are you...

Is this making any sense to you?

I just need to know that you're hearing me.

I was out of line.

I just hope you know who I am, Bobby.

And I'm sorry.

Well, I apologize, too.

And I appreciate you saying it.

By the way, it's a sauce.

<i>It's not gravy.</i>

Jesus. It's a gravy, wise-ass.

No. Gravy you pour on
turkeys on Thanksgiving.

Sauce you put on other things.

Yeah, that's right. Now you're an American.

Yeah.

Look, if this doctor's gonna do the old,
you know,

cough and juggle the nuts,

can I leave?

Fuckin' idiot.

They got golf,
they got 14,000 swimming pools,

90,000 resorts.

Nah. Where am I going?
Boca.

Nah.
Tampa bay.

Clearwater.
Miami beach.

I got my pension. My house is paid.

I got the kids nearby. For what?!

I'm just saying.
You could get, like, a mansion down there,

especially since the market took a shit.

It took, like, a diarrhea.

Listen, I was down there already.

We went to visit my wife's sister's family.

And I'm telling you, her husband...

I swear to God, you look at this guy,

he's, like...
they're waiting to call his number.

Pull a ticket, time to go. Go ahead.

He was gonna die?
It's as hot as Vietnam.

Nah, nah, nah.
It's hot up here.

My grandkids are in the neighborhood.

Nah, I'm not going.
Got grandkids.

If you guys don't want me in here,

just say the word.
Aww!

Then get the fuck out.
<i>- Come here.</i>

I'm serious.
Come here.

What's the matter with you?
We want you here.

Come on.
What's up, fellas?

How you doing, Anthony?
How you doing?

How you doing? Vin, how are you?

Hey, Bobby.

Oh. Carmine.

What a big surprise.

So how's life?

Good, good, good. How's things?

How's business, Dom. You all right?
Everything good?

How's business? If I tell you,

you think you're gonna let
the whole neighborhood know?

Ah, Dom, what's with you?

What's with me?

Dom, what...

What's the matter? What's wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

Who the fuck are you to
talk to me like that?

Dominic, come on.
No no, hold on a second.

Hold on a second, Bobby.

Carmine obviously has something

that he wants to say to me.

Why don't you relax?

<i>Sit down, Vinnie.</i>

Did I offend you?

Yeah, people that gossip
too much offend me.

All right, dom, what can I get for you?

I know what you can get me.

Get me a fuckin' bat

so I can shut this washer
woman up for good.

<i>You fuckin' gossiping prick.</i>
All right, you gotta go.

You gotta go, Dominic.
I gotta go?

Dom, your old man ain't around anymore.

You can't talk to people like that.

Are you fuckin' talking about my father?!

Dom, now you gotta go!
That's it. Oh yeah?

You think 'cause you're running
errands for the old man,

you can talk to me like that?
Yeah, I think that.

Who the fuck are you talking to?
What's the matter with you?

You think it's the ninth grade?
Watch your fuckin' mouth.

And you... I should've buried
you a long fuckin' time ago!

Bobby, what's going on here?
Don't worry about it.

Rita, mind your own business!
The men are talking.

Don't talk to me like that.

Your old man...
Are you crazy?

Your old man is washed up.
Dominic!

Mind your own business! Shut the fuck up!

Fuck you!
You fuckin' dyke!

Now you gotta go!

Now you're going! Now you're going!

Yeah, you're an asshole!

Get the fuck out of here!

Rita!

Shit. Sit down, sit down. Rita, come here.

You want to get... I'll fuckin' kill you!

Hey! Carmine's having a heart attack!

What?!
He's having a heart attack!

We're so sorry, Angela.

Thank you for being here.

If you need anything, just let us know.

Thanks, Bobby.

He really loved you guys, you know?

We loved him.

And he missed your dad a lot

once he moved down to Florida.

I know. My father called.

He told me tell you that he's...

He's heartbroken.

Thanks, Bobby.

You'll send him my love, won't you?

Yeah yeah, I will.

We'll be here if you need anything, okay?

Okay.

Love you.

Love you, too.

Angela.

Mario.

Mr. Joe.

Mm-hmm.

Hmm?

Hey, what's up?
Oh my God, Rita. Look at your face.

Yeah, I know.

I never liked dom, Jr.,

even when he was a kid.
Couldn't stand the effing guy.

I hear he could get charged with something.
No, not for this.

Yeah, tell her that thing you heard.
What?

That thing you told me. Tell her.

What are you talking about?
That thing, tell her.

What thing did you hear?
It's nothing.

It was a rumor I heard in the deli.

<i>What did you hear?</i>

I heard that... I overheard somebody saying

that he's been cooperating for a while.

It could be totally...
No shit.

Yeah.
I knew he was good-for-nothin'.

Don't tell your father
you heard that from me,

'cause I don't even know if it's true.

Bobby, I would never tell my
father in a million years.

<i>You're a great guy.</i>
Okay.

I gotta go check on my dad.

All right. We'll see you later.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

What did I do?
What do you mean, what did you do?

Why would you bring that up here?

<i>- Why would you even say...
Did you see her face?</i>

<i>Why would you say something like that?</i>

Who was it, daddy?

Don't worry. He's not on the list.

What's the matter, dad? You look nervous.

This is an important night for you.

I don't want to screw it up.

And also, what if somebody sees me?

Dad, you could never screw it up,

and nobody's gonna see you here, okay?

You happy?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm happy.

I'm a little nervous right now.

You, too?
Yeah.

We're nervous together.

I think she's here.

Dad.

No.

Okay.

Besides, I have a little surprise for you.

Go easy, all right? This is a lot for me

to take in one night.

Okay.

She's here.

How are you?

Good, thank you.

Dad, um...

This is Anna, and Anna's my girlfriend.

<i>I'm sorry. I should've told you.</i>

You're not mad, are you?

No, she's, uh...

She's your... She's your, uh...

Yes, dad, she's my girlfriend.

So nice to meet you again... formally.

You, too.

I hope you're not mad at us.

I'm not mad, no.

Rita missed you quite a bit, and...

Well, she couldn't wait for me to meet you.

Well, she's a great girl. Everything...

I mean, her happiness is everything to me.

You're not mad?
I'm not mad.

She's so beautiful.

<i>Let's sit down and order some wine.</i>

Yeah. A bottle of Amarone.

Let's have some wine.
Sounds good.

You've done good.

Well, I'm...

I don't know what to say.

Me, either.

Is this...
Let's order some wine.

Is this what "awkward" means?

Hey, over here. Come here, come here.

This is what "awkward" means, right?

Yes, it is.

Uh, you know, back in the day,

we didn't see things the
way we see them now.

And I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I'm not gonna change that way.

But I am gonna change,

because I have found...

The world is not gonna change,

so I have to change.

But the only reason to change is beca...

Because my daughter's happiness

is the most important thing to me.

Nothing else matters in my life right now.

Thank you, dad.

Thank you for saying that.

I appreciate that.

Okay.

So now let's get onto
a more important subject.

Okay? Now, this subject
has to be spoken of.

So, in my researches, if you will,

I found that it is medically possible

and in other ways it is
societally possible that, uh...

Dad, wait, what are you trying to say?

What are you trying to say, dad?

When am I gonna see a grandchild?

What?

Whoa.

Okay.
Wow.

You got me, now I got you.

You got us, dad. You definitely got us.
He's spunky.

I'm very serious. I'm an old Sicilian man.

I got a right.

I don't know what to say.

It's possible. I know it is.

Dad, we'll work on it.
We will?

Yeah, we're gonna work on it.
We'll work on it.

Okay, we'll work on it.
Yeah.

Makes me happy.

Let's go, Frankie!

<i>Let's go!</i>

Come on, Frank, let's see what you got.

<i>Break the ball, baby!</i>

Hey.
Hey.

How are you?
Good, how are you?

Come on, Frank.

<i>Frank the tank!</i>

There you go, Frankie!

Run this one out. Here you go, Frankie!

All right, Frankie.
You're making me look bad.

Come on, baby!

Come on, babe! Hit one out of the park!

Baby, get the heating pad ready.

Come on, give me something nice.

<i>Be nice. Something nice.</i>

It's all right. It's all right.

Next one, next one.

All right, let's go!

We had a little problem, right?

Yeah, but, you know, it's all fine.

I wanted to talk to you for a while now.
Sure.

I've been trying to talk
to Bobby, get you...

Yeah, me, too.

Let me hit something. Let me hit something.

Hey!

Hey!

Joe!

Joe! What happened?

Bobby, what happened?
Go! Take the baby!

<i>Call for help! Frankie!</i>

Hey. Go help.

Dominic!

Hey! Help!

Dominic!

Hey, keep breathing.

Hey! Breathe.

Joe, you gotta breathe.

Joe. Dominic.

Hey!

Get help!

<i>What the... What is this thing here?</i>

<i>I feel like I'm wearing a wire, sweetheart.</i>

<i>I don't know why you're making me do this.</i>

<i>Okay, I think it might be on. I don't know.</i>

<i>I've never done this before,
but what the fuck?</i>

<i>I'm sorry, I don't mean to... bad language.</i>

<i>You want, uh...</i>

<i>You wanted me to do an electronic journal,</i>

<i>so here you go.
What else am I gonna do in here?</i>

<i>I wish I could say this
to you face to face,</i>

<i>but obviously I don't
have much of a choice.</i>

<i>How's things out there? How are you?</i>

<i>How's your love life?</i>

<i>You know how much I love you, right?</i>

<i>I'm looking at a concrete block wall,</i>

<i>wondering what it's gonna
be like when I'm back home.</i>

<i>I'll be out of here next year sometime,
you know.</i>

<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

<i>I know you're probably disappointed in me,</i>

<i>and I can understand why, honey.</i>

<i>There's so many things I want to tell you,</i>

<i>but I'll start here.</i>

<i>I am sorry I wasn't the
father you always dreamt of.</i>

<i>I'm old-school.</i>

<i>I live by a code I can't explain.</i>

<i>I'm a street guy, and I
got myself into this.</i>

<i>I promise I'll do whatever I can</i>

<i>to make our time together
special when I get home.</i>

<i>I promise you, honey.</i>

<i>Okay, I'm gonna change the subject now,</i>

<i>because I don't want to get too
emotional about this thing here.</i>

<i>Anyway, I can't wait to get out</i>

<i>and meet this significant other</i>

<i>you keep talking about.</i>

<i>Who is this guy?</i>

<i>He better be handsome, or you know what.</i>

<i>I can't wait till you
have a kid, sweetheart.</i>

<i>I need at least that.</i>

<i>I know that that sounds selfish.</i>

<i>Look, I'm babbling now.</i>

<i>This journal stuff is making me tired.</i>

<i>I don't even know if this thing</i>

<i>is taping what I'm saying to you,</i>

<i>but I'm getting sleepy, sweetheart,</i>

<i>and the guys around here
think I'm going crazy,</i>

<i>talkin' to myself.</i>

<i>I'm going to bed now.</i>

<i>I'll hit this button because it...</i>

<i>This looks like the on-and-off switch here.</i>

<i>Okay, sweetheart. Daddy loves you.</i>

<i>I'll try this thing again
in a couple of days.</i>

<i>Good night, baby.</i>

<i>Good night.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>â™ª You're my love, you're my angel â™ª</i>
