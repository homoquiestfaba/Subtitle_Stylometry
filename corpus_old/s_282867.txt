No, take him back to my office

I asked you to catch "Flower Kid"

But you double-crossed me too

He has cheated me too!

I can't stop laughing!

You still accuse me?
No!

Then you'll be responsible for the outcome
Yes!

Close your eyes

Who are you really?

"Flower Kid"

No, he hates woman,

he won't disguise as a woman

Furthermore, he's not so fat

Why?

If he is,

he wouldn't be called "Flower Kid"

He'll just be a stupid melon!

Also, he's not so young as you!

So you're not "Flower Kid"

Tell me, who you are!

Fatso!

It's so nice to see you again!

Yes!

You said you've never been here

You take credit card?

How can you refuse to

What's happened?

Someone ask for "Flower Kid",

No, I'm here

You come for "Flower Kid"

if you admire him

It's because of curiosity

I'm looking for "Flower Kid"

Because it's my duty

So there's no conflict between us

Boss, 2!

How dare you sell stolen chickens?

You have made me confused!

2, 3.1 kg

Let me handle you!

Please go outside

"Flower Kid" Who's he?

You're beating him

The money is mine

Where's my money?

Useless guy, chicken thief

Why do you beat my idol?

You said you'll hit him

each time you see him?

He's my idol "Flower Kid"

You're "Flower Kid"?

I'm not!

He denies it

Please go out if you want to fight

Why does he look like this?

He has retired

Why do you steal chickens?

Who's it?

Yes!

You're his boss?

Where's your brother?

I almost need to stay in hospital!

For repairing!

I'm his boss,

I've to deal with it

Which gang do you belong to?

I'm 4 times 100 metres champion

Fierce?

I don't believe, you are so fat!

And you?

Listen to my family poem

We're playing majong
and I'm the banker

It won't be a drawn this time

He's reciting the poem!

Recite one to him

I don't know any

Just say anything

1,2,3,4,5,6,7

You look like a chicken

7,6,5,4,3,2,1

I'm the best of everything

Phoney stuff

Boss!

Help, Boss!

He can't save you!

Don't go,

I'll get help!

Go away?

Haven't you seen this before?

Go! Go!

Let's go back to our business,
where're we?

I haven't said anything!

You want to play dirty tricks again?

I was just asking about him!

What has he said?

Speak up, "Flower Kid"!

I was a "Flower Kid"
when I was young

But now I'm old, 5 years ago

One night, I want back to the inn

I was told that your Kung Fu is good

Yes, my Kung Fu is good

But not in bed, please get out!

Even undress her undercover

How is her body?

I haven't seen it!

Very stupid!

You should have at least a glance!

But it made me more angry

I want you to kill my husband

You've found

the wrong guy

I never killed innocent people

Get out!

Why should this come on me?

It's ridiculous to kill her own husband

Have you gone to bed?

No, I threw her out of bed

You bitch!

I won't hesitate if your
husband wants me to kill you

Get out!

Well-done!

You're merciless!

So she tried her best

to kill me

And she'll never stop!

Where can she get so much money?

That's very easy

for a woman to earn!

So she has found a millionaire

Another poor guy!

Remember,

never offend any woman

Lady, please sit!

I don't like sitting, go away!

I'm very angry!

Who makes her angry?

That fat guy tied me on a tree!

I've told you

Not to offend any woman

I... what shall I do?

He has to apologize

or he'll die

Do you hear, go!

I?

Don't do the same!

Come here...!

Say sorry to her

Let her say in joy!

What shall I do?

Listen, just do whatever she likes

Understand? Go!

Disgusting!

Filthy couple!

Well, where are the jewels?

I don't know!

Maybe it's her?

Daring! When will we go away?

It'll be very soon!

Well, where are the jewels?

Over there

In fact, why let "Flower Kid"
bother you?

He's death won't cause you any good

And his living won't cause
you any bad neither

I must want him die

He's coming

So you're "Golden Killer"

And they?

My men!

Where's the money?

I want you to kill...!

Not you, but a woman,

I come for her

She wants me to kill
"Flower Kid", right?

Wait, there's something more!

This letter is fore you!

The "Golden Killer"

has not come yet!

He'll, and there's another killer

waiting for me

I can never escape this time!

We'll finish them one by one

I'm boss, open the door!

Where have you been

Iast night?

Me? Wait!

I... I have done it!

What have you done?

You want me to make her happy

But I haven't told you to...!

You idiot! Come here...!

You can't go,

we can't do without you!

Why do you want to leave?

waiting for him!

Really? Let me handle him

You can't, it's useless!

He can hit the target
from a long distance!

He's nothing comparing

to my friend!

This is my friend "Flying Dagger"!

He's no.8 of his family

We are good friends

Is he alright?

Certainly

One day,

a fly threw across his face

You guess what has happened?

What?

No more fly!

So he can hit his target
from a long distance!

Then we can stand further away?

It's a long distance

from the inn here

Fantastic...

I'll make him out

His dagger is so fierce?

Just listen to his poem

Chicken and dogs run away
when they hear me

No one can escape
from my dagger

Please!

Just over there, wait for me

Where's he?

Over there, you see?

Who?

It's him, look!

The one next to him!

We should have

Iet Fatso try it!

I won't hit a handicapped!

You can't judge by the face!

How are you?

I'm alright!

I'll find a coffin,

you try to save him

Don't go away!

Find a place to hide!

It's useless you should
hide yourself

It's useless,

I've tried it!

Just eat

if you can!

I've bring you DDT

to kill the mosquitoes

Is it safe?

Absolutely

This!

But you haven't told me yet!

It's jail!

I'm forced to do this

We'll be in trouble
if I don't catch you

You'll be safe

and I'll be out of trouble!

This is for our

mutual benefit, right?

No!

Who said so?

I did!

How dare you do

such filthy things!

You know I'm not clean

He's a person to be respected

And you treat him like this

This string is very loose!

Don't run away!

All you know

is money

And you're always

dreaming of fame

Fame?
I've never wanted to be famous!

Excuse me

No!

For fame is better than for money

You can't be famous as "Flower Kid"

How is he now?

Is "Flower Kid" your friend?

Shut up, get out!

What's wrong with "Flower Kid"?

Something wrong with your eyes?

Again, which one of
you is "Flower Kid"?

I'm, so what?

You ain't, where's he?

I don't tell you!

You!

Beat him!

I won't spare you next time!

I... dare not!

We are not finished!

Take this!

Go!

Get "Flower Kid" to help you

if you want to avenge

It's all your fault!

Your fault!

It's all because

you admit yourself as "Flower Kid"

Always want to be known

Now, you have got it!

You'll be hurt!

It's so difficult that
we've found a gold coin

You do good

in the brothel

But now who'll sympathies you?

Come with me!

This is my house!

When I was 5 years old

Father, died in front of the gate

And mother died when I was seven

I become a hard labour
in order to survive

My life was even worse than pigs

But I still haven't cheated anybody

But still I was despised by others

I swear I must be

famous one day

So that everybody will know about me

I admire "Flower Kid"

and his behaviour

What's wrong to imitate him?

Tell me what's wrong about it?

You're not wrong!

I'll help you to fulfill your wish

But "Flower Kid"...!

I can make him strong again

That shortly gun fighter
is very fierce!

Fierce? He's nothing
compare to my old friend

How can you borrow it?

Not borrow but steal!

Quiet or you'll wake him up

He's a deaf, close the door!

He's over there!

What did you say?

He's over there!

I heard you, don't have to shout

Don't you afraid he'll see you?

Why? He's blind!

Go ahead and find!

Have you found the gun?

What's the hurry?

What are you looking for then?

The money!

Where's the gun?

Inside the pillow box!

You seem very familiar
with the place

He's my father-in-law

You don't have to
steal but borrow!

I have sold his daughter

You stingy fellow!

How about me?

Your're grent

How can you fart at this moment?

He's blind and he's deaf!

He's looking for you
from the smell!

Fatso!

Someone is here!

Father-in-law, it's me!

It's bad, he can't hear

Hide yourself!

I haven't died

No!

This gun is in good condition!

It's better than nothing!

Our hero "Flower Kid"
will depend on it!

Will he use it?

He has to!

We've been looking for you

We have found you at last!

Please go inside!

Thank god that

we've found "Flower Kid"!

You're wrong, I'm not "Flower Kid"

Don't deny, listen to me!

We're poor farmers,

I had 2 sons and a daughter

And we've a few acres of land too

One day, there came a vagabond, he...!

He wanted to rape my daughter

But my sons heard it
and fought with him

But they were inferior to him!

He killed my 2 sons!

Who's he beast?

He's Chung Fa-pai,
the "Golden Killer"

You are the only one to kill him

No... "Flower Kid"
has already dead!

Hero... please come back,
listen to me!

I know it's very difficult

to have you here

We know this is

too little for you!

I won't accept your money

if I can help

Sorry I'm not able help!

Please wait,

wife, go ahead!

Wait,

I've something else for you!

Chiu-lin!

You're the only chance we've got!

Open the door!

Although I'm not pretty,
I'm still a girl

My brother died because of me

If you don't help us,

they couldn't rest in peace

And my parents will blame for this

Please help me, hero!

I can't...

please don't, open the door!

Hero, please don't go...!

No!

You have given her to him

You!

She's my fiance,

tomorrow we'll get married

How can you do this...? Speak!

Chiu-lin...!

You are too stupid!

The hero hasn't even touched her!

Is it true?

Yes!

I'm sorry...!

Chiu-lin!

"Chung Fa-pai" The "Golden Killer"!

You acted very well!

Excellent show!

Happy co-operation

They're better actors than you

How about me?

You haven't fainted yet?

And no tears neither!

And haven't dead!

You still want the money?

He's fainted!

Pay...!

Wake up

Go!

Pour the water!

We've succeeded the first stage

Now we've to give him
back his confidence

I got these kids

to fight the old man

Remember, stand a blow for a coin

But 5 coins will be deducted

if you hit him

Don't let me lose my money!

Yes!

You should know what to do!

Help...!

Help... help!

Why don't you ask me who they are?

Who are they?

"Golden Killer's" men

Line up all of you...!

One blow!

Good, well done!

I can't!

Look, fantastic!

Two!

Another one!

Very fierce indeed, good posture!

Of course!

Four altogether!

Come on!

No more!

Well, I'll give you $10
if you can hit me!

You still owe me $4!

I'll never work for you again!

Go

Get lost...!

"Flower Kid" still a hero!

One against four!

No!

He's exhausted!

So we have to train him!

How?

This dog has been
starved for 3 days!

Tie this beef on his body,

he'll have to run

Where shall we tie it?

At the back!

How?

You're too stupid!

Watch!

Just like this!

It's alright

now

The dog doesn't chase!

Stupid, the dog's being tied up!

Try to release it!

Be strong, young man!

Mama!

Mama!

Music!

Stop...!

It's funeral music!

Make it stronger!

Don't be afraid, we're here!

Let me try!

Let me try!

I have told you let me have a try!

I really mean it! Come on...!

We have made it!

Hero, congratulations!

I knew you'll make it again!

What did you say?

We can go to find
the "Golden Killer" now

Daddy!

Ta-pao! Erh-pao!

Why you killed

my 2 sons?

So it's your

two fellows

What? Singing opera?

I hate this guy

See what you have

put on!

You have put on the wrong dress!

What's so funny, general?

How dare you scolded me!

Which one do you want?

If you wish, you can
fight them all!

What are you doing?

I was hit...

Who's he...?

The one dressed in black

Why don't you beat him back!

Miracle!

Accident!

You are smart!

Of course,

I've scared them to death

It's your turn now!

My ideas always work

It's alright!

It's alright!

Another accident again!

It's none of my business, go

Be careful!

I'm sorry,

it's just an accident!

Cool!

Even a hero will be drowned
in women's tenderness

I have found "Flower Kid" for you

Where's he?

Money first

Cash, no credit!

Go and get the money!

Yes!

She looks okay,

why "Flower Kid" is afraid of?

You can never judge
a woman by her look!

Madam

Where's "Flower Kid"?

Hero, come out, man!

Strange, I turn hard
when seeing her

But you turn soft?

I'm just talking about our hearts!

In fact, she's not frightening!

Go ahead and slap her

I won't slap a woman

You're too useless, watch me!

I can't!

Nice job you've done!

You can still come here alive

But you'll die here today

I'm the one who make you die here

Bull shit, why don't you try!

I come this time to challenge you

But I'll surely win!

Win? Who do you think you are?

Yes! Beat him!

How's that?
I learnt this from you

If your men haven't
trapped me last time

I wouldn't have fallen into water!

Leave him to me, master!

How dare you call him master?

Master!

Leave this one

to me

Are you ready to take my blow?

Gone!

You're right, this one is for you!

Go ahead! Go!

Master, this one is for you!

Me?

Go...!

I'll leave this place to you!

Master can't do without me,

Don't be afraid, you look like a man!

Smart, handsome,

young and ambitious

How can you be destroyed

by such a woman?

Come in if you get guts!

Come on!

Stupid!

Have a drink and get her!

Come on!

Don't waste it

Have you seen my friend Fatso?

Ghost!

Why you beat him?

Shut up!

"Flower Kid" has handled the girl

Stand aside!

Listen to me, it's true!

Stop!

General, come and help!

Why do you beat me?

Where's our enemy?

Over there!

Where else can you go?

What do you want?

He has come with his man!

Where are they?

The one dressed in black

Don't be afraid, let me handle him

It's none of you business,
I just beat him!

How dare you laugh at me!

I've eliminated my enemy

I have eliminated mine too

Don't go, something
interesting is coming!

What are you looking for?

Watch me catch the idiot

Idiot, where are you?

Come with me!

Just in the front, come on...!

Where's the idiot?

There's only me and you!

So if it's not you, it'll be me!

Why did you do it?

Sheriff put $5 on you!

You do this just for $5

I won't refuse money! Sheriff!

Sheriff! $5!
