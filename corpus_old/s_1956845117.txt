(PHONE LINE BEEPS)

MAN: Kay. Hi, it's Mike Adler
here from Creswick Police.

Look, I'm just calling about
your mum.

The neighbours haven't seen her
in a few days.

I've been by her house,
without much luck.

And I was just wondering
if you'd heard from her.

Could you give me a call
when you can? Thanks.


Gran?

(KNOCKS LOUDER)

Gran?

(LOUD KNOCK ON DOOR)

Gran?

Mum?

Gran?

Wait.

Justâ€¦wait out here.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

Mum?

KAY: You should set up
in my old room.

SAM: What?

Kay, what?
Nothing.

Call straightaway if sheâ€¦

Yeah, I will.
OK.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

ADLER: Does your mum
still drive?

KAY: Sometimes. But her car's
still at the house.

And... any medical problems?
No.

She's in her 80s.
She forgets things.

She managed to flood the house
last Christmas.

And when was the last time
you spoke to her?

It's been a while.

Could... you be more specific?

Umâ€¦

Well, in situations like this,

we... we need to come up
with a time line.

When Alex called last night,
he said he hadn't noticed

your mum leave the house
for a few days, maybe a week.

So, if we can figure out

who the last person was
to speak to her, we can...

Yeah, of course, yeah.
..figure out exactly whoâ€¦

Sorry. Umâ€¦

It's been a few weeks.

Work's been crazy.
You know how it is.

And what did you talk about?

Nothing, really. Normal stuff.

She didn't mention anything
about a holiday,

appointment out of town,
visiting friends?

No. Nothing like that.

We'll organise
the overall search strategy.

OK.

Did you bring a recent photo?
Yeah.

This was taken late last year.

(LOUD THUD)


(HEAVY CLATTERING)


Great... (SIGHS)

(RAIN PATTERS OUTSIDE)


(DOOR CREAKS)


(PLASTIC CRACKLES)

(WATER SPLASHES)

She's been putting food out
for Chester.

Is your boss OK
with you taking time off?

Yeah.

Well, no.

I stopped working
at the gallery.

Since when?

A while.

What are you doing for money?

I've got some decent shifts
back at the bar.

Still planning on
going back to uni?

I don't know, Kay.

So, what, you're just gonna work in a bar
for the rest of your life?

Yeah, maybe.

I'm glad you're here.

I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to be doing.

I think you're doing it.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

ADLER: (CALLS OUT) Edna!

Edna?!

Edna!
KAY: Mum!

MAN: Edna?!

Edna?!

Mum?!

WOMAN: Edna?!

MAN: Edna?!

Edna?!

ADLER: We'll regroup
first thing tomorrow.

SAM: We should check
the trail by St Georges Lake.

Gran used to take me there
all the time when I was a kid.

(VACUUM CLEANER WHINES)

(SWITCHES OFF)


(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

Gran?

Jamie?

Hi, Sam.

What are you up to?

Patrolling.

OK.

Did you find her yet?

No, not yet.

When was the last time
you saw her?

Not for ages.

Dad doesn't like me
coming over anymore.

Why's that?


Can I have a go?

I'm allowed.


You're 18!

When did that happen?

(COUGHS SLIGHTLY)



Thanks, Jamie.
I really needed that.

I might go inside. It's freezing.

Do you want to come in?
Make you a Milo?

Nah.

That's OK.

How do you know?

(PLAYS)
Gran taught me.

Of course she did.

I could never get the curl
of the fingers right.

I think she gave up on me
at a certain point.

Are these locks new too?

(CONTINUES PLAYING)

I think she was scared.

Scared? Of what?

She called me a few weeks ago.

She thought someone
was coming into the house.

What? Why?

Doors were left open,
the lights were left on,

she... the...

..armchair had shifted.

Wellâ€¦

..did you tell the police?

She forgets things.

You know what she's like.
It was her.

Well, why didn't you call me?
I could have driven up here.

I mean, what if she wasâ€¦

Mum?

Where...?

Where have you been?

Tea?

Are you OK?

One sugar, right?

Gran!
Oh! (LAUGHS GENTLY)

KAY: About half an hour ago.

No, she's... she's not hurt.

She's... As far as I can tell.
She won't tell me anything.

Whenever I ask, she just changes the subject,
acts like nothing happened.

Like she hasn't been gone
for three days.

Yeah, I don't wanna push her.
I just... I just hope she's OK.

Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah, I will. Bye.

Any chest pain?
No.

Breathlessness? Dysuria?

Dysuria?

Does it hurt to pee?

Oh. No.

Neither of those things.

Would you mind taking a slow walk
to your daughter and back?

Edna, when's your birthday?
April 10th.

And how about
your granddaughter's?

March 3rd.

Good.

See?

This one worries about me.
(CHUCKLES)

May I?
Mm-hm.

Do you know
how you got this bruise?

Oh... I must have knocked it.

Clumsy.

Just to be safe,
I'm going to recommend

that you not be by yourself
for the next couple of weeks.

Is that really necessary?
Sorry, Edna. I insist.

House arrest it is, then.

(ZIPS UP BAG)

(TV PLAYS FAINTLY

(EDNA SIGHS)

KAY: Well, tell them
it's a family emergency.

Yeah, I know that,
but he's perfectly capable.

Uh-huh. A week, maybe two.

Well, what do you expect...?

Yeah. Fine. Fine, email it.

I've gotta go, Luce.

(TV CONTINUES PLAYING
IN THE BACKGROUND)

(WASHING MACHINE CHURNS)

EDNA: What's that?

Do you know
where you were, Mum?

Where?
No, I'm asking you.

I suppose I went out.

Out where?

If I'd known you'd call the police,
I would have stayed home.

There's blood on your nightgown.

Do you need help?

With what?

There are Post-it notes
everywhere, Mum.

It's my house.
I can decorate it however I want.

Just tell me what happened!

SAM: Look, can we just
take it easy today?

Gran must be exhausted.


(INSECTS CHIRRUP)

(KNOCK AT DOOR) Gran?

Oh.

Got your tea.

What service!

Sorry about Mum.

She was worried about you.

We all were.

(OPENS DRAWER, RUMMAGES)

I had to stop wearing it.

They say you shrink with age,
but my fingers just keep getting fatter.


It's lovely.

It's yours.

Gran, I can't take this.

You might need it one day.

And your mother's
already had a go.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)


Wow, you cleaned up.

Please leave it. I've got a system.

What are you doing?
Work.



Guess I was. (CHUCKLES)

Wow.

He could draw.

Yeah.

God, I haven't seen this for years.

(UNSETTLING MUSIC)

Wait. What's this?

Oh...

Oh, that was on the property
when your grandparents inherited it.

My great-grandfather lived there.

By himself?
Yeah. There were all these stories.

Apparently, his mind
wasn't all there in the end,

and nobody knew how bad it was.

I don't think he was cared for
like he should have been, you know?

Mm.

I was happy to see it go.

Mum used to threaten to lock me in it
when I was being a brat.

Is that the same window as
the one on the door downstairs?

Yeah.

Yeah, when they tore it down,
they saved some of the windows

and used them to build into this place.

Can you keep an eye on her
for a few hours tomorrow?

Where are you going?
Back to Melbourne.

You going back to work?
No. I...

I've booked a tour
of a retirement place.

You can't put Gran in a home.

You heard her before.
She doesn't know where she was.

I don't think she can remember.

That's not what I heard.

She can't live on her own
anymore, Sam.

Well, why can't she move in with you?
Because that's not practical.

There's plenty of room at your place.

No, it's not about room.
She has to be watched.

Well, isn't that how it works?

Your mum changes your nappies
and then you change hers?

You need to be on the same side
as me for this.

Does Gran even get a say?

This is what's best for Gran.

EDNA: (WHISPERS) What noise?

No. I didn't hear any noise.

I told you. I told you it's nothing.

There's no-one.

You're scaring me.

KAY: Mum?

(TENSE MUSIC)

Are you alright?

Are you leaving?

No, Mum.

(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)

That's good.

(LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)

Will you be alright now?

(OMINOUS MUSIC)

Mum?

(SOFT, HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

Mum, what is it?

(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING
CONTINUES)

It's here.

Under the bed.

No, there's nothing
under the bed, Mum.

Are you sure?

Yes.

Will you check for me?

Please.

See? Nothing.

You didn't look.


(TENSE MUSIC BUILDS)

(LOUD THUD)
Ow!

Shit! Oh!

Oh!

You did that on purpose.

Did what?
You dropped that on purpose!

Why would I do that?
I don't know.

Did you hit your head?
Yes! Yes! Yes.

WOMAN: Now, you mentioned your mother
has some cognitive impairment?

KAY: Yeah,
I... I don't really know.

She forgets things.
She's started wandering.

WOMAN: Well, the staff here
are on call 24/7.

Think of it as independent living
with the edges taken off.

(MUFFLED VOICES NEARBY)

Just in here.

This side of the building
has ocean views.

Handrails in every room,

high toilet seat,

mobility aids if your mother needs help
getting in and out of bed.

No, she's fine with that kind of stuff.
She's fit, she's active. I...

I'm not even sure she's ready
for a place like this.

WOMAN: Well, it's five-star living.

Then there's the lifestyle
and therapy programs,

disability support,
computer classes.

Your mum'll make friends
in no time.

The rec room is decked out,
and every Sunday night...

â™ª To red roses in June

â™ª These are the things,

â™ª Though I'm not a great musician... â™ª

Dance with me, Kimmy.

â™ª I have always had... â™ª

Sorry?

Dance with me, Sammy.


Ah!
Oh, no...

Yes! Here we go.
(LAUGHS)

SAM: Oh, boy.

Do you know the cha-cha?
Absolutely not.

Time for a lesson.

One, two, three.
And one, two, three.

And... It's the cha-cha!

Oh, "the lady".
And again.

â™ª Cling to me... â™ª
Who?

Jamie from next door.

Oh.

The retard.

â™ª Clear that here

â™ª Is an atmosphere

â™ª We should share... â™ª

How...

How would you feel about
me moving to Creswick?


Why would you want to do that?

To be closer to you.

I could help you out -
cook, clean, stuff like that.

Was this your idea or your mother's?

Mine.

(MUSIC STOPS)

Where would you live?

Here, in the house. With you.

I don't think so.

I'm not a... project, Kay.

I'm... I'm Sam, Gran.

I know who you are.

Well, wouldn't it be better than
moving into an old folks' home?

That's where Mum is right now -
checking out a place in Melbourne.

Here, let me help.

What's this?
What?

What are you doing with this?
What do you mean?

This is mine.
Yeah, Gran, you gave it to...

You're trying to steal from me.
You're trying to rob me.

No. Remember when you...
Give it back.

Give it back!
Ow. Gran.

Ow! Ah!

Oh!

Fuck. Take it!

You're throwing these out?
I didn't even know you'd kept them.

Well, I have to make room, don't I?

Room for what, Mum?

This one's moving in.

(KAY SCOFFS)

No, she's not. She...

I think you're confused, Mum.

I'm not sure why you think
it's your decision.

How was Melbourne?

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

(LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)



Everything alright, Gran?

I don't like this place.

Is that why you installed the lock?

I thought this was where it got in.

Who?

Whoever was coming into the house.

Since your grandfather passed,
this house seems...

..unfamiliar. Bigger, somehow.

This house is the only thing left.

All our memories.

I'm glad you're moving in, Sammy.

I need to go downstairs.

There's someone down there.

Everything alright in there, Mum?

Sammy?
(DOOR CREAKS)



(WASHING MACHINE RATTLES)

I'm not being ridiculous.
I can tell.

Sometimes they look at me
and I... I don't think it's really them.

They look like Kay and Sammy,
but it's not them.

They're pretending.

You know what I think?
I think they're just waiting for the day.

I think they're hoping I'll go to sleep
and I won't wake up.

Then they'll dump me
in the ground to rot.

I can see you.

Who are you talking to?

(RUMBLING AND CREAKING)

(SCRAPING AND CUTTING)

(GASPS SOFTLY)

Gran, you're bleeding.
I can do it myself.

You've hurt yourself. Just...
No!

Get out of here!

Get out! Get out! It's my room!

It's my house! Get out!
I'm sorry!

(SLAMS DOOR)

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Hi, Sam.

Hey, Jamie. How are you?
I'm OK.

Is your dad home?
Uh...

Dad?!

Alex, what happened...
between Jamie and Gran?


They were playing hide-and-seek
and it was Jamie's turn to hide.

And he hid, I guess, in a cupboard
with a lock on it.

Well, she came along and locked the closet
and... left him there.

I think she forgot they were playing.

He was trapped in that cupboard for hours.

When he didn't come home,
I went over there to check on him and...

(MUFFLED KNOCKING)

..Edna said she hadn't seen him.

But I could... I could hear him
screaming from upstairs.

He had paint under his fingernails
just from scratching the door.

So, we've been keeping
our distance a bit.

Yeah. Nah, of course.

I get it.

(DOOR OPENS)

I'm really sorry
Jamie had to go through that.

OK.

Mum...

Mum, stop.

Ow! Jesus!

What are you doing, Mum?!

No! No!

Give it back!
No, Mum! No!

I'm still your mother, Kay!


(HEAVY BREATHING, RUSTLING)

EDNA: I think these might be safe
out here.

Do you think that's right?

KAY: Safe from what, Mum?

I don't know.

I knew it was a bad idea.

I hate that window.

I can't bear to look at it
every time I go through that door.

There's such a...

..coldness in the house.

This is what I'm like now.
It's all I do.

I keep thinking...

..thinking maybe it was
just waiting for me,

maybe it's just been waiting
till I was weak enough.

Alone enough.

I wish I could bury it myself
so it can't get at me.


I just wish I... I could turn around and...

..go back.

I'm losing everything, Kay.

No. It's alright. You're not.

I'm here. I'm here to help you, Mum.

Come home with me.

To Melbourne. Will you... will you
move into my place, Mum?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't here more.

Please let me help you.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Where's...

Where's my...

Where's everyone?

Your photo album?

It's here.

It's right here.


Where's everyone?

They're here. They're here. I'm here.

It's alright, Mum.

I won't leave you.
