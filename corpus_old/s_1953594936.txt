ah! detention. boring.

i can think of a few things
we can do

to kill some time.

brad, baby, you remember

this is what got us into
detention in the first place.

you only got me for three more
months till graduation.

and it's off to boot camp
before officer training.

i know, bradikins,
it's just...

i'm just saying,
that was the time

to show your suppport
for our troops.

you do...support...

our troops.

i do, it's...

hi, janet.

brad.

i didn't know
you'd be in detention.

what ev.

i saw you got a "d"
on the calc test.

yeah, well, mr. corbin
is a sexist.

i'm sure. anyway, i thought,
maybe, i don't know...

i could tutor you.

hey, ed, remember how i like
to hang out with you?

oops.

hell, yeah.

shit.

hey.

yo.

you got it?

doth the ashman ever fail you?

you're sure it won't pop
in a piss test?

100% untraceable.

dude, if marky mcg
had been popping these,

he could've run for congress

instead of lying
in front of them.

good. and you're sure
you can get more?

i've got the straight hook up.

wait. what's the m for?

um...

uh, midalithamethamine.

that's uh, its clinical name.

hey, i've heard of that.

smart guy.

uh, edster. did you come
to visit me in the big d?

uh, no, i got detention, too.

no way. you got detention?

now when your mom accuses me
of being a bad influence,

she actually has a leg
to stand on.

uh, yeah.

can the ashman interest you
in his other wears?

grade a. called blue sky.

and trust me,
it will get you soaring.

yeah.

no. no go, dude.

this body's a temple.

there's no way i'm polluting it
with that shit.

check it.

i tell you, edster, if i ever
meet george romero,

i'm gonna seduce him and bear
him little zombie babies.

but then they would
probably eat us

which would be kind of sad

because that means no more
living dead movies.

but it would be a great metaphor

for what kids end up doing
to their parents

when they turn into teenagers.
right, ed?

mrs. rumblethorp?

eddie.

i was wondering
if you decided yet

about telling principal mcmann.

marksamus! mi amigo.
how doth it hang?

oh, whoa, bro, you ok?

it's my hand.

some crazy bum bit me
out in the parking lot.

i'm sorry. i don't think
i can just ignore this.

what you did is serious.

it's illegal.
not to mention dangerous.

you can't tell him because
this is my chance.

it's harvard.

well, here, let dr. ash
take a look.

i got the cure
for what ails you. here.

oh, whoa, dude!

you got some legit
nurse visiting rights.

yo, mrs. rumbles!

ms. ro, i think you should
check mark man's hand.

no, i told you...

marksamus.

for serious, hit the nurse.

for one thing, she's like
10 times hotter than rumbles.

mrs. rumbles!

that dude's totally got rabies.

you don't go rabid
in a couple of hours.

ok, back up, everyone.

uh, mrs. rumblethorp...

help her!

he's strangling her!

on the count of 3.

he's not letting go.

1, 2, 3!

my uniform!

jesus christ, she's like
bleeding to death,

and you're worried
about your uniform?

it's blood. do you know
how hard blood is to get out?

guys!

i think marksamus is dead zone.

uh, i'm gonna get help.

willow, we need something
to stop the bleeding.

this is dry clean only.

hey!
problem solved.

uh...guys?

come here!

what are they doing?

what kind of rabies is this?

it's not rabies.

they're zombies.

holy fucklestein!

oh, my god!
what are we gonna do!

i say we get the hell
out of here.

damn straight.

i don't think
that's a good idea.

what?
no, look, look, look!

the guy who bit mark
must have bit other kids.

if they turn into zombies
and bite other students,

you've got what you call

infinitely expanding
growth potential.
huh?

one zombie
equals many more zombies.

oh.

so we can't go out there.

we don't know how many more
could be out there.

they could be everywhere.

what are you saying, we should
stay here and hide?

mrs. rumblethorp,
you shouldn't be standing.

she's trying
to say something.

<i>oh, hey, you really need
to stop doing that.</i>

<i>it's even grossing me out.</i>

brad, baby.
what?

kill it.

why me? jim, you kill it.
i'll get the next one.

you're the one joining
the rotc.
so.

so go get all hoo-rah
on his ass.

sorry, but i think staying
in there is a bad idea.

agreed.

how long before she,
you know...

i don't know,
but we can't leave her.

uh, to the back, come on.
come on!

this is the future
of our american military?

i know. pretty soon even
the french will conquer us.

chuck? yeah, man, hit that shit.

shit.

i'll check
if principal mcmann is here.

babykins, you won't let them
hurt me, will you?

janet, babe, i have years
of military experience.

alright, they won't
lay a finger on you.

you have years
of military experience?

yeah. i've been paintballing
with my dad since i was 6.

principal mcmann?

oh, damn it!
i got nothing.

uh, i got nothing here.

yeah. me neither.

nor i.

me, too.

maybe all these, uh,
corpsicles

are creating some kind
of undead zone.

hey, lilly and ashley
are out there.

they are? well, open the door.
let them in.

they're a little busy
right now.

doing what?

eating rick bliscan.

what are you laughing at?

uh, well, when uh,
ashley and lilly were alive,

they were always talking about

who would get a piece of
rick's ass first.

so?

lilly won.

oh, fuck.

that's not funny.

well, it's a little funny.

kind of cool.

no, no, no.
this is not cool.

i know you all
are raging freakazoids and all,

but even ones as far removed
from cooldom as you

should still understand

how much further from coolness
this situation is.

yeah.

janet, you should
really lighten up.

lighten up? no, this is
no time to lighten up.

if anything, we should all
be getting heavier.

well, maybe you should
stop upchucking

after every meal then.

hey! janet's right.
this is serious.

and serious times call for...
serious minds.

thank god we have you then.

was principal mcmann in there?

partly.

i don't want to die here.

ok.

this zombie shit

is really starting
to harsh my mellow, ok?

all right, look.

come on, you too, willow.
get in here.

all right, this school

is crawling with god knows
how many zomb-heads.

we need to find somewhere
to hold up.

and we need to fortify.

well, yeah, but everywhere
we go,

there's going to be
deadheads already there.

yeah, we need somewhere
no one goes to.

the library.

why would we go there?

it's perfect. one major entrance
and plenty of shelves

to barricade the door.

sounds easily
defendable.

yeah, and it's
right down the hall.

good. 'cause all this
running and shit

is tuckering the ashman out.

yeah, i don't think
mrs. rumblethorpe

can take much more
moving around.

most important...

yeah?

not a single student
in this school

would be caught dead there.

don't you mean caught...
undead there?

what do we do about that,
brainiac?

from the little observations
that i've been able to make,

zombies seem to be
uni-attentional. ok.
what?

zombies only pay attention to
what's right in front of them.

oh.

so, so if we don't draw
their attention...

we should just be able
to walk right by.

you go first.

way to go, edster!

this way!

downstairs. go! go!

hey! hey! come here!

come and get me!
come and get me!

hey! go, go, go!

come and get me!

come and get me.

come here.

in the library!
get the door! get the door!

go! go!

yeah!

aha!

yeah! hell, yeah!

jesus, eddie.

i know, i didn't think
that would actually work.

ok, she's not looking too good.

i can't believe
this is happening.

i am student council
vice president.

junior prom queen,
and head cheerleader,

and i have a serious problem

with the direction this school
is taking.

well, i'd adjust quickly
if i were you,

or the next popularity contest
you'll be winning

is most likely to get eaten
by the student body.

aah! oh!

again?

damn it, janet. help me.

what should i do?

here. hold her neck.
keep pressure on it.

eddie's been studying medical
school since like infancy,

so maybe he knows.

ew!

hey, what is it?

oh, nothing big.
just the end of the world.

ah! ah!

mrs. rumblethorp?

oh, please don't be dead.

please?

ok...

ok...ok.

come on. janet!

bradikins. you saved me.

guys, help me!

whoa.

aah!

did she bite you?

no! i bent my finger weird.

i can't hold her much longer.

her brain. her brain!
what?

eddie's right, the only way
to kill a zombie

is destroy its brain.

that cuntress has been riding me
since i was a freshman.

it's time for some payback.

bring her to me.

how you like me now,
rumbly thumbly? hmm?

it looks like rob zombie

raped the entire cast
of gossip girl

and this is their angry
love child.

and who knows what it's
like everywhere else.

tried the land lines.
nothing.

so we're completely cutoff
from the rest of the world?

what about the internet?

none of our phones
can get a signal.

school computer?

really?

that thing's so ancient

it makes old tron
look cutting edge.

it's worth a try, ok?

you know, maybe we can
email for help.

or tweet. omg, zombies
attacking the school.

send help pronto.

here goes nothing.

this might take awhile.

well, if this isn't
a commentary

on the current state
of public education,

i don't know what is.

yeah, that helps.

everything will be ok.

look at you.
you are way too hot to die.

like the werewolves
are to vampires,

or are you
team switzerland?

oh, yeah, me too, yeah.

um, hey, guys,
i think we have a problem

of incalculable proportion.

huh?

big problem.

<i>oh.</i>

are they getting in?

no, no, not yet, janet.
but they will.

there's no way they're gonna
make it through the barricade.

their numbers are growing,
jimmy. they're gonna get in.

well, then i say
we run for it.

no, no, that's--

yeah, he's right.

all right, we make a run.

maybe someone out there
has a cure or something.

yeah, and go back out there?

yeah.
with them?

bradikins, baby,

i can't do it. i can't.

ok, look.

i've seen about every zombie
movie there is,

and one internal truth
in all of them

is that going outside
equals bad.

exactly.
i say we run for it.

and outrun the high school
of the damned.

look, from what i've seen,

i don't need to outrun
one of them.

i need to outrun one of you.

and i'm pretty damned sure
i can beat asthma boy here.

i don't have asthma.
not all dorky kids have asthma.

yeah, look, we make a run.
right, some of us will make it.

look at her.

she's got big-ass boots on.
she can't run.

survival of the fittest.
hoo-rah.

i breathe just fine. thank you.

oh, bradikins, i can't
go out there and compete.

i play sports.

i'm totally ok with the current
living situation.

i'm just saying.

i bowl. i'm a bowler.
i'm an excellent bowler.

eddie, focus, come on.
focus, please.

sorry. right, sorry. jimmy.

jimmy, your plan only works
if we all agree to go out there,

and clearly there is a large
dissenting opinion

that plans just stay put.

like me.

and me. brad, babe...

you won't leave me here,
will you?

we stay.

come on!

oh, you guys seriously
need to chillax.

chillax?

yeah. look on the bright side.

bright side? the school
is overrun with zombies.

what's the bright side?

when else do you get to
decapitate your english teacher

and then continue to torment
her undead head?

right, mrs. rummy thumber?

oh! no biting! that's a bad
mrs. rumbly thumbly. huh?

detention for you!

ash! stop taunting the undead.

all right.

all right, look. i got it.

if we're going to stay,

we need to treat this
like a siege situation.

our greatest danger is lying

either a frontal breach
of our defenses,

or a small scale incursion

via an as yet unrecognized
weak point.

we do some recon.

eddie, you're
a book geek, right?

you know how to look stuff up
and shit?

sure.

maybe there's something in here
that can help.

zombie stuff, like a how-to
survive a zombie attack.

or what to do if bitten.

this is a high school library,

so i'm not sure there's
a lot of reference material

on zombies.

yeah, too bad this isn't
the library

from buffy the vampire slayer

cause they had a wicked
dark art selection.

what?

i liked the two gay witches.

wicked chicks are hot.

ow.

damn it! there's gotta be
something, right?

sorry, but when it comes
to living dead,

your best source of info
is right in front of you.

between eddie and i,
we've seen about every movie,

read every comic book
and played every video game

that has anything to do
with zombies.

yeah, that's right.

when it comes to zombie
survival, we're the bad asses.

fine. eddie, willow, you'll act
as our intelligence--

well, that's in no way
ominous or forboding.

baby?

janet, babe, don't worry, ok?

i'll kill anything that
comes through the door.

jimmy!

jimmy!

oh, man, no!

jimmy...hey. hang in there.

i don't feel so good.

all right.
i'll give you some air.

hang in there.

this is not
getting us anywhere.

stay there!

ugh.

whoa.

i mean we can't
just leave him there.

he's gonna turn.

hey, we all saw what happened
to mrs. rumblethorp.

so, what? you want to throw him
out the window?

it's jimmy for christ sakes.

not for long, bro.

brad, baby, they're right.
you know they're right.

ah, fuck.

brad.

jimmy.

hoo-rah.

no!

hoo-rah...

we're all gonna die.

we're all gonna die!

we're all gonna die.

janet, it's gonna be ok.
we're gonna be ok.

we're gonna be ok.

uh, um, group hug.

thanks, guys.

i'm ok now.

wonder what caused all this.

nuclear fallout?

military super soldier
experiments.

meteors.

biological weapons.

aliens.

diseased monkeys.

you know what i don't get?

mark. when he turned all
aberzombie and fitch,

he was still pretty fast.

but marion the zombrarian
was all slow and stumbly.

clearly each zombie retains

some of their physical
attributes

from when they were alive.

all right. enough.

enough.

we all seriously
need to chillax

before someone pops
a blood vessel.

chillax? what the fuck
is chillax?

chill. and relax.

when the powers combine,
chillax.

whatever.

all i'm saying is i think
it's time

to intro a little...

mellow.

hmm? hmm? hmm?

to this pity party.

sweet. share the wealth.

as the lady dark doth command.

wait, is that marijuana pot?

something like that.

i don't think this is the time
to be getting high.

i need something
to calm my nerves.

what say you, bradtasm?

yeah, fuck it.
for medicinal purposes.

secondhand smoke?

won't the zombies
get the munchies?

ed, they already have them.

fine.

smoking weed equals death.

what?

in the movies,

smoking the weed equals death.

drinking equals death.

having sex equals death.

basically having fun in any way
will get you killed.

right. horror movies
are total

moral righty conservative
propaganda bullshit.

tell me about it.

i've never been so happy
to be a virgin.

what?

i'm waiting for the right girl.

uh, sure, if by the right girl

you mean someone lame enough
to sleep with your ass.

no, no. i mean...

yeah, whatever.

high school sucks.

just do it.

oh...

what was that?
what is it?

oh...

he was enjoying it, too.

ugh!

uh, me and uh,
pale tits mistress

of the extreme eyeliner

are regulars in the good ship
detention, but um,

what the hell
are you three doing here?

nothing.

oh, come on.

what's an 18th level wizard
dungeons and dragons geek

like you doing in detention?

i'm a paladin.

what?

wizards are for spazzes
and losers.

right.right.

so what about you,
sweet cheeks?

oh.

well, nothing. we were just
caught in the bathroom.

what were you guys doing
in the bathroom?

are you...in the bathroom?
that's gross.

i'm just playing.

check it, willow-winds,

uh, slutskin mcdrop-her-drawers
is embarrassed.

no. we were...
we were just kissing.

oh, get off it, janet.

everyone in this school knows
you got a mouth

that could suck start
a jet engine.

hey, come on.

fuck you.

and fuck you, too!

what, you boys get to chase
every ass in tight jeans,

but i do what it takes
to satisfy my boyfriend,

and i'm a slut?

pretty much.

you don't get it.

no one does.

get what?

how hard it is to be me.

oh, please.

there's so much pressure
that comes with being popular.

everything i do,
everything i wear is judged.

by everyone.

oh, poor you.

i always have to say
the right thing,

wear the newest clothes,
date the coolest guy.

and in the end,
you all still hate me.

we don't hate you.

yes, you do.

you social rejects hate me
because i'm popular.

and the popular kids hate me
because...

i'm more popular than them.

well, if being popular
is so rough,

then why don't you,

i don't know, stop trying
to be the queen bee.

that's easy for you to say.
you've never been popular.

you're not the only one

whose felt uh, so trapped
by who they are.

that they did something stupid.

really, really stupid.

holy shit.

where'd you get a gun?

you were gonna columbine us?

i wasn't gonna columbine you.

the gun is for me.

you were gonna off yourself
in detention?

is this because
i make fun of you?

no.

is it because i didn't
go to prom with you?

what? no. i didn't even
ask you to prom.

it's because of her.

i thought you and the rumbles

were all apt pupilage
and whatnot.

yeah, we were, till she
found these.

adderall?

i was just using adderall
to help me study.

mrs. rumblethorp
just caught me.

and they weren't
prescribed to me. per se.

so you were riding
the adderall train

to ivy league town.

yeah. i got into harvard.

i studied my butt off
to get out of this shit hole.

to get into somewhere where i
wasn't put in a urinal

for wanting to learn.

that's why i'm in detention.

and look, i want to live.

i want to live through this.

but to do that,
we'd need to work together.

we'd need to put all our petty,
stupid self interests aside

and work for the greater good.

well, this is high school,
so fat chance.

damn it, ash,
this isn't a joke!

two hours ago,
she's running detention

and accusing you
of smoking out.

i fail to see the difference,
eddie.

guys?

look, edstser,

there's one thing i know

and it's when push
comes getting eaten,

it's every man, cheerleader,
meathead, dork,

and scary yet
strangely attractive goth chick

for themselves.
hey, guys...

that's the attitude
that's gonna get us killed!

dude, we're all
dead meat anyways.

might as well
enjoy the ride, edster.

guys!

what?
listen.

hit it!

get it out of here!
get it out of here!

get it, eddie! get it!

get it out of here!
get it out of here!

you saved me.

oh, my head.

what?

what do i do? what do i do?

pry its fingers off.

stay still!

ah, screw that!

relax. i got this.

janet, help me!

shoot it fast. shoot it!

no, no, no! don't shoot it.

oh, my god.

oh, i got you, ed!

i got you, ed.

ah...ah...ah...

1...2...3...

that was intense.

what's the math say?

that the amount
of zombies out there,

should they make
a concerted effort...

yeah?

they'd break through
in about 35 seconds.

so we're basically screwed.

yeah.

is that what you really want?

yeah.

what?

she's beautiful.

sexy. super popular.

perky. not to mention perky.
i'm a big fan of perky.

you're just like
the rest of these idiots.

you were a bunch
of mindless

zombies
before any of this happened.

trying so hard to fit into
their little clique.

trying so hard to hide anything
that might make them stand out.

i mean, god forbid

we don't all fit into this
cookie cutter mold

that everyone puts us in.

popular girl.

bully.

stoner idiot.

dorky loser.

i'm not like them.

sure you are.

you'd die for one night
with janet.

not because you love her
or that you care for her.

just because she's
what everybody tells you

you should strive for.

and you were going
to kill yourself last night.

why?

because you weren't going to
get into harvard?

so what, eddie.

does that mean your life
isn't worth living?

you're right.

maybe i need to...

i don't know, grow up a bit.

maybe we all do.

hey, if we live through this,
um...

yeah?

would you want to, you know...

i mean, if you don't,
that's cool, i mean...

oh, no. i want, i, i uh...

i definitely want to.

oh. cool.

cool.

edster!

uh...

how long until the zombie horde
gets bored

and scampers into the next
taco bell?

i don't know. in the movies,
the horde never goes away.

it keeps getting bigger.

and that's what makes it
a horde.

well, we have a problem then.

what?

le toilet.

come on, man.
find a corner or something.

oh, gross!

oh, no go, man.

i gotta take a deuce
from the caboose.

i say we blow
this popsicle stand

and make a pit stop
along the way.

just hang your ass
out the window.

oh, no, so some zomb-head
can take a bite out of my ass?

we're on the second floor.

zombies don't jump, idiot.

oh, screw that.
i watched shark week on tlc.

and if some great white can jump
20 feet out of the air

to grab a tasty seagull
snackpack,

who's to say a zombie can't?

well, there are major
logic flaws--

no. ash is right.

he is?
i am?

yeah. no, not about
zombies jumping. that's stupid.

but we need to get
the hell out of here.

we can't leave.

the barricade's our only
protection.

i gotta go, man.

that means a trip
to the little boy's room.

ed, you know,
maybe they're right.

you said yourself
the barricade won't hold.

maybe we should
make a run for it.

i'm not going out there.

brad, baby, you wouldn't
leave me, would you?

i'm sorry, babe.

come on, let's go.

no, you can't.
you can't go.

if you start moving
things around,

you're gonna draw them closer
to the door.

hey, wait.

what?

what if there's another way?

what, are you gonna escape
through the vent shaft?

no. i'm gonna send my little
sidekick ferret to go get help.

it'd be so cool
if that were true.

look at it this way,
this might be our only chance,

and i for one would like to live
past this day.

especially now that i have
something to look forward to.

what if there's a zombie
in the shaft?

how's a zombie
gonna get in the shaft, eddie?

i don't know. zombie rats?

<i>like in house of the damned?</i>

those fuckers
will eat your shit up.

there's no fucking zombies
in the shaft, you guys.

i'm going.

me, too. ashbury needs
his porcelain throne.

ed, look, this might be
your only chance, ok?

well, i'm not going.

isn't someone gonna stay here
with me?

ed?

i'm sorry, willow.

come on. let's get out of here.

let's go.

let's go.

um, do either of you
have any idea

which direction
we should be going?

of course not.

you're a really great guy,
you know that?

can i ask you something?

sure.

would you ever...

go out with a guy like me?

i don't think so.

uh-oh.

what? what is it?

oh! fuck, dude!
confined spaces.

oh, god, ash.
not cool. not cool.

i told you i had to go.

why?

that's just the way it is.

that's the way it is?

you're a geek, right?

um, yeah. i guess.

well, i'm a hot cheerleader,

eddie, help me!

brad, baby, i'm sorry.
i know i cheated.

i betrayed him.

no, no, janet.
actually he betrayed you.

what?

yeah. he's been telling
the whole school

that he's been screwing you
for months.

no, we were waiting for prom.

that's not what he told me.

yeah, i don't even think
you'd make it to prom.

because he's got like 6 girls
on the side.

what?

yeah. like lilly and trish,
and sarah.

whores!

and you know what else,

he told me you're not
a  natural blonde.

what?

yeah!

you fucking fucker!

yeah! fuck him up!

you fucking fucker!

maybe if you reciprocated
once in awhile

you'd know,

the carpet
does match the blinds!

match the blinds?

just go with it.
she's on a roll.

get out! get out!

let's go!

yeah!

it's not gonna hold.

we need to get out of here.

well, maybe we should
spend more time

building up the barricade
and less time

making out in the back.

well, maybe if people knocked
instead of just barging in.

what does that have to do
with anything, janet?

oh, my god!
stop it both of you!

now we're getting out of here
alive,

and to do that we need
to work together.

how?

i have a plan.

we reached the stairs.

oh, god, we reached the stairs!

eddie! eddie! help! eddie!

eddie, help!

jesus christ, we get it already.
you need help!

take a number, get in line.

and shut the fuck up,
would you, please!

eddie!

eddie, help!

eddie!

goth chicks kick ass.

eddie, help!

the gun.
isn't that...

mr. yeardley
the guidance counselor?

it's almost empty.

definitely not good.

what now?
we run!

run away!

the gym. we can get
to the roof from there.

it's locked!

i got this.

i got it!

eddie, come on!

go. go, get to the roof.
i'm gonna hold them.

and willow,
about before with janet...

you're right.

i'm an idiot.

i know what i want now.

good. because you still
owe me a date.

it's time for this paladin
to cast a 21st level spell

of zombie whoop-ass.

where's eddie?

holding off the horde.

ok.

but he missed a few.

no.

janet, hold still.

come on!

willow! janet!

suck a duck.

this sucks.

yeah.

i'm gonna die.

i don't wanna be a zombie.
this so sucks.

don't leave.

one bullet left.

i don't want to die like this.

eddie!

ok, we have a problem.
what?

zombies don't jump.
they climb.

brad!

brad!

so i guess we'll never
get that date.

no. it sucks.

i was totally gonna take you
to applebees.

attention, attention.

the zombie threat
has been contained.

all survivors make your way
to the front lawn.

go! go! go!
i want to get a perimeter.

set it up. move it, move it,
move it!

the zombie threat
has been contained.

the zombie threat
has been eliminated.

all survivors make your way
to the front lawn.

so applebees, huh?

bet your ass. i got a gift card.

wow, you really know how
to spoil a girl.

yeah. but only the right girl.

<i>attention, all shoppers.
attention, all shoppers.</i>

maybe we got a good thing
going here.

maybe we shouldn't be
in such a hurry to leave.
