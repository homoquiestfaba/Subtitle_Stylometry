He's coming.

Cover your butt.

Cover the what?

Vitruvius.

Lord Business.

You've hidden the Kragle
well, old man.

Robots, destroy him.
Yes, Lord Business.

Your robots are no match
for a Master Builder.

For I see everything!

My eyes!

The Kragle, the most powerful super-weapon
is mine.

I have the Kragle!

Now my evil power will be unlimited!
Can you feel me?

I can feel you.

Nothing's gonna stop me now.
Wait.

There is a prophecy.
Now there's a prophecy?

About a Piece of Resistance.
Oh yes.

The supposed missing piece of resistance
that can somehows magically disarm the Kragle.

Give me a break.

One day
a talented lass or fellow,

A Special one
with face of yellow,

Will make the piece of Resistance
found,

From its hiding refuge underground.

And with a noble army at the helm,

This Master Builder will thwart
the Kragle and save the realm,

And be the greatest, most interesting,
Most important person of all times.

All this is true

because it rhymes.

Oh Wow. That was a great inspiring legend

that you madeup.

A Special one?

What a bunch of hippie-yippie baloney

RELIC FOUND

Hey pal, I hate to tell you this but I

The rules specifically, state:

"The work site close at 6,
its hard hat area only..."

That's not official
safety orange.

If you see anything wierd,
report it immediately.

Well, I guess I'm gonna have
to report you...

Where are you going, Miss? I didn't
mean to scare you ...I'm soo. Arrrgh.

Arrrrrggggh.

Hey, that's not so bad...

Ouch... Ouch.

What is that?

I don't have my instructions.

<i>Touch the piece...</i>

<i>Touch the piece...</i>

No, I... Master Builder?
So, you never heard of the prophecy?

Or the Special?

No, no...
Liar!

I'll kill you!

Look ...Uhhmm

I watch a lot of cop show
on TV...

Isn't there suppose to also be...

Isn't there suppose to be
a good cop?

Oh yes. But we're not done yet.

Hi, buddy. I'm your friendly
neighberhood police officer.

Would you like a glass of water?
Yeah, yeah actually.

Too bad. Security Cameras
picked up this.

You were found
at the construction site.

Convulsing with a strange piece.
That's disgusting.

Then why is it permenantly 
stuck to your back?

What?

Take it back, get off me.
Oh come on it's chasing me!

Look, It's not my fault. I have no
idea how this thing got on my back.

Of course, buddy, I believe you.
Great!

I believe you too.

You see the quotations I'm making
with my claw hands?

It means I don't believe you.

Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back.

Just three days before President.
Business is going to use the Kragle.

To end the world?
President Business is gonna end the world?

But he's such a good guy.

And Octam. They make good stuff.

<i>Music, dairy products,
coffee, TV shows,</i>

<i>Surveillance systems,
All history books, voting machines...</i>

Wait a minute.
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

Come on..
This is a misunderstanding.

I'm just a regular
normal, ordinary guy

and I'm late to meet
My Best Friends in the whole world

and they're probably missing me right now.
They are probably out looking around.

"Hey Where's Emmet?"
"Where's my Best friend Emmet?".

You know what? Ask all my friends.
They will tell you.

Oh. We asked them alright. BOOM.

That guy
He's not a criminal mastermind.

<i>See? He is always kind of a...</i>

<i>Average.. Normal kind of guy.
Thank you.</i>

<i>But he's not like normal like us...</i>

<i>He's not that special.</i>

<i>I'm so confused...
Who are we talking about?</i>

<i>Wait, does he work with us?
Gail does not remember me?</i>

<i>Look at Randy here.</i>

<i>He likes sausage, that's something.</i>

<i>Gail is perky, that's something.</i>

<i>And Harry well... - When you say Harry,
I go ...Ha..Haa .ha. a ha ha haaa.</i>

And when you say <i>
the other guy, I go...</i>

<i>I know that guy,
But I know like zippy-zap about him.</i>

We just talked earlier.

And all I am mean he does is say yes
to everything everybody else is doing.

He's just sort of a..

And a little bit of a...

Blank slate I guess.

<i>That will be $ 42, please.</i>

We all have something that makes
us something, and Emmet is...

Nothing.

There you go.

I told you I said I was nobody.

It's the perfect cover.
Cover? Cover for what?

I can't break him. Take him to the
melting chamber.

What? No!

No!!!

No!!!

You're going to melt me?
Am I gonna die?

You'll live You'll be fine.

President Business,
I have him right here, sir.

Yes. We have told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape.

But, eh.. we're lying to him.

Wait, what did he just say?

Hold still.

Wait! There's obviously been a mixup here.
You got the wrong...

That is going to start hurting
pretty soon.

No, no, no no. Ohh who.

Ohh, whoahh.

Who are you?

It's you?
Come with me if you wanna not die.

Hi, everybody!

How's the melting...
Hey, hey, hey hey!

Red Alert! Red Alert!
I need everyone.

Repeat, everyone to go after
the special.

The tunnel's that way.

Oh boy.

Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

We'll build a motorcycle
out of the alleyway.

GEAR

So, Ah.. Didn't catch your name.

Or anything about..
What you're up to,

or what we're doing here.

It's brilliant sir that you've had it being
a useless nobody,

But, you can drop the act,
with me, It's cool.

Oh, the act?

Jump on. Let's go.

Hang on, sir.

All units,
Cut 'em off on neon, now!

Or whatever you can.

10-4, bad cop!

Watch out!
Hold on.

We need to meet-up with Vitruvius
tell him the piece has been found.

Ah-ha.
They're up on the motor rail.

Release the Copper-chopper.

Oh no!

Can you please tell me
what is happening?

I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

You're the Special.
Me?

You've found
The piece of resistance.

And the prophecy states.

That you're the most important,
The most talented, interesting

and the most extraordinary
in the universe.

That's you, right?

Yes, that's me.

Great. You drive. What?

I wanna go home.

This is not what I meant.

Oh no! Look out, Special.

Sorry!
Never driven a motorcycle, sorry.

Wow, that's amazing.

That was incredible. Your even better
then the prophecy said you'd be.

Really?
I'm Ahh.. I'm Wild-Style.

Oh, I'm sorry what was it?
Wild-Style.

Wild-Style?
Yep.

What are you a DJ?
No.

Oh then that's your name, It's Wild-Style?
Yeah.

Like on your birth certificate it's
says Wild-Style? Let's not talk about my name.

Don't let the Special get away.
We block the freeway.

Hang on, sir.

What are you doing?

Let's fly.

Head for the secret tunnel.

These are the city limits.
Let's just head for the tunnel.

You want me to drive to that
wierd swirly hole?

Are you insane?
Don't break, go! Don't stop, go. Now!

Can't do this.
That is against the instructions.

Wait. What's your favorite restaurant?
Any chian restaurant.

Favorite TV Show?
Where are my pants.

Favorite song?
Everything is awesome.

Oh no.

Darn, darn, darn! Darny darn!

Wait. Where are we?

THE OLD WEST

This is so weird...

You're not the special.
You lied to me!

Well I mean.. It depends..It realy kinda..
Your'e not even a Master Builder, are you?

Well, I know what a Master Builder is.

Why don't you tell me what it is
that way I can see if you're right?

You ruined the prophecy.

Look, I'm Sorry, Ok?
You just that...

Made being a Special
sound so good.

And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

You were?

Well here is the thing, how do we
know for sure that I'm not the special?

We just don't know it yet...
Quiet.

Yo warn you want a giant turkey leg?

You have any idea
what it does to your..

Oh My G-o-s-h!

Just put the hat on.

Oh, and this, and this
and this, and this.

And by the way,
I have a boyfriend.

Ahhh.. not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

It's super serious
and you do not want to mess with him.

Ok.
So. Don't get any ideas.

I never have any ideas. Wait!

Take 'em up you felles
hands where I can see them.

Hey, listen do'ye think you can explain
to me like why am I dressed like this,

with this big words in the sky were all
about and like where we are, in time?

Your home, Bricksberg
is one of many realms in the universe.

There is also this one, the Pirates club,
Knights club, vikings land,

and the clown town, and bunch others
that we don't need to mention.

Lord Business, or as you think you know
him, President Business,

Stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

Blah, blah, blah...

Proper name, Place name
and stuff...

It's the Special.

I am so pretty I like you

but I'm angry with you
for some reason.

Putting the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle and disarm it forever.

Great.

I think I got it,
but just in case...

tell me the all thing again.
I wasn't listening.

<i>OK. All of the people in the universe</i>

<i>were once free to travel,
and mingle and build whatever they wanted.</i>

<i>But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.</i>

<i>So he erected walls between
the worlds.</i>

<i>And came obcessed
with order and perfection.</i>

<i>And he stole a mysterious
secret-super weapon called.</i>

<i>The Kragle!
And he hired Bad Cop to hunt down</i>

<i>all the master builders
Who were always changing everything.</i>

<i>Those of us who remained
well we went to hiding</i>

<i>built a tunnel to survive.</i>

And we searched for the
Piece of the resistance.

The only thing that can
stop the Kragle.

Kragle. I know that.

That might have been that cop
He said something about the Kragle.

The President Business was going
to use the Kragle to end the world

in three days.
I can't make any sense of it.

The Taco Tuesday.

I knew that was suspicous.
There is no time to lose.

We must find Vitruvius and get to the
Office Tower before it's too late.

Ok. How scary can
someones' office be?

THE PRESIDENT BUSINESS OFFICE

President Business, we're
trying to locate the fugitive

but his face is so generic, it matches
any other face in owr database.

Diabolical. Ok.

Have Bad cop meet me in my office
in 23 seconds. Ciao!

Coffee sales are through
the roof, sir.

Great to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher.

The Roof Team is on it!

Sir, can you approve this Poster
for Taco Tuesday?

Perfect!
WOO!! I love everyone in this room.

We love you, sir.
Hey, guys.

Great job on the radio seg.!
Thank you, sir.

We love listening to
this song over and over again.

Keep it up, guys.
Honey, Where are my pants?

Hilarious. That never gets old.
It does not.

Bad Cop is waiting
for you, in your office.

Wonderful, fantastic.
Would you cancel my 2 o'clock?

This meeting can run
a little bit deadly.

<i>Activating Helmet.</i>

<i>Light sequence.</i>

<i>Flames attached.
Engage dramatic entrance.</i>

Bad-Cop.
Lord Business,

I know the Special got away,
but...

Don't be so serious.
Where's the other guy?

Hey. Hey, buddy. I missed you.

Oh.. Did you really?

Have I ever shown you my relic collection?
Nope.

I don't think you have.
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

This one is the cloak of Ban-da-id.

I heard it's super painful
to take off. Do you want to try it on?

Well, I... No, but thank you.

We got some great work over the years
together bad-cop.

Capturing all those
Master Builders

and torturing them,
and what not.

Thank you, sir.
Although,

You did let the Piece of Resistance go.

The one thing the could ruin my plans.

The one thing I asked you to take care of.

That's super frustrating.

It makes me want to pick up whoever
is standing closest to me

and just throw him through this window and
out into the infinite abyss of nothingness.

But I want to do it so bad.

I know you do, sir.
But Please, please don't.

And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

People everywhere are
always messing with my stuff.

But I have a way to fix that.

 A way to keep things exactly the way
they are supposed to be. Permanently.

Behold!

The most powerful weapon
of all the realms.

The Kragle!

As you can see, they're loading
the Kragle on a big machine upstairs.

I call it the Tentacle
Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

Or TAKOS. The "S" is silent.

So on Taco Tuesday, it will spread the
Kragle over everyone and everything

with the bunch of super
scary nozzle, like this one.

I'll show you how it works.
Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

Oh, Don't worry.
I won't test it on you.

I'll do it on your parents.

What?
Hiya, son.

Hi.
How is it going in the big city?

Mommy, Daddy.
What are you doing here?

Ok, pa.
I just want to you to act naturally.

Like you were going 'bout your day.
Got you.

Keep your hand up like that.

Ma, scoop two steps into the right.
Pa, why do...

Whenever I talk to Ma,
you start to move.

I'm sorry, sir.
Get back to where you were.

Here?
Perfect. That's great.

,You can't do anything better
There's no reason why you should move.

Right. Now, Ma,

hand on his shoulder,
and you... Pa, you're just moving.

And you just wrecked it!
You wrecked it!

Bad cop, you see what I'm talking about.

All I'm asking for is
Total perfection.

Send in the Micromanager.

What are you doing?
My god, what is this?

Hold still you guys.

Then, I'll just spray them with TACO.

Oh pa, hold me.
Oh darling.

Can't move me legs.

Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
Surely, you feel bad for your parents.

And you want to help them, Don't you?
We're Ok, son.

Just a little stuck, that's all.

Go ahead,

finish the job.

Of course, sir. No, I don't want to.

You have to. I don't want to.

Would you -Please be quiet.
I can't.

You must. But they...

Shut it! It's not nice...

It's your job, man!
I can't do it, they're innocent.

Just as I thought.

Your Good Cop side is
making you soft, Bad Cop.

Robots, bring me the Police crest inceptor and
the q-tip and the Police Remover of na-eel!

You Already left the Special
get away once.

Sir.
We're just gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.

No more Mr. Nice Guy!

Oh, son!
On Taco Tuesday,

I'm going to Kragalize the entire universe, so
that everyone will stop messing with my stuff.

Or you're gonna be with me.

Or you gonna be stuck having a tea
party with your mom and dad?

Son. Sorry, Dad.

I have a job to do.

All you have to do
is blend in and act like you belong here.

Perfect. Hi there, I'm a cowboy.

Bang bang, b, b bang bang.

Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Bullet Bullet, gun.

What are they looking at?
I made a mistake.

You should be just still,
Act like a stool.

Howdy, guys?
Wait, No, stool don't talk.

Don't sit on me.
Stool don't talk, hush.

Let me show you how it's done.

What a lady

Ok. We'll just find the wizard
and get this over with.

Psst, there he is.

Vitruvius.
Who? I've never heard of that man.

Who I am not. Who are you?
It's me.

I am a blind man and cannot see.

It's Wild-Style.
Are you a DJ?

Why does everybody? Wait, wait.

Were you the student I used to have who
was so insecure who kept changing his name?

No, no. Yeah, first Dark Storm,

Then Jemminy, then Wild-Style then...
No, no.

Smazzy Pants. Okay, yes.

Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

"10" SECONDS LATER

Wow! Man...

You have a very wierdly
decorated place.

Thank you.
Vitruvius.

We have found the Piece of Resistance.
Is it true?

Yeah, but...
Wild-Style, the prophecy states that.

You are the Special.
Embodiment of good, foiler of evil,

the most talented,
the most briliant,

The most important person
in the universe.

That would be great but...
Emmet is the one who found the piece.

Okay, Emmet! The prophecy says
you are states that you are the Special.

The most talented...
I'm not sure he's the Special, actually

because he's not
even a Master Builder.

Watch. Emmet, just give a watch around,
you and build something simple.

Great. Like an awesome race car.

Do you have the instructions?
No.

You must create the instructions
in your mind, my leige.

Oh, Ok. Racecar.

Well, There's a lot of really cool stuff
here.

Don't see.. a wheel or...

three more wheels.

See? He can't do it.
He will never be a master builder.

Of course not. Not if you keep
telling him he can't.

He need to see that he can.

What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

To prove to you have the unlocked potential
of a good to be Master Builder.

Wow. Are we inside
my brain right now?

It's big. I must be smart.

I'm not hear a lot of
activity here.

I don't think he ever had
an original thought in his life.

Haha. That's not true.
For instance,

once time I want to have a
bunch of my friends to watch TV.

Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

And not everybody
can fit in on my one couch.

And I thought to myself:

Well, what if there's such a thing
as a bunk-bed, but as a couch.

Introducing, the double-decker couch.

So everybody would watches TV
together, and be buddies.

That is literaly the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

Please Wild-Style,
let me handle this.

That idea was just the worst.

There must be something around here
that proves his potential.

If the man upstairs chose
him to be the Special,

There must be a reason.
Who is the man upstairs?

See? He does't even know
about the man upstairs.

He has like super gross hands* that
looke like they're made out of sausages

like Eagle talons mixed with squid.

You are seeing that...

Whoahh that's what I was just
thinking about.

How did you...
I had this weird dream that I touch the piece

but I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

Emmet, you had a vision.

I did?... Master Builders

spend years training themselves
to clear their minds enough

to have even a fleeting glimpse of
the Man upstairs. And yet..

Your mind is already so prodigiously empty

that, there is nothing in it to clear away
in the first place.

With proper training,
you could become.

A great Master-builder.
I could?

The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

I can't do any of the stuff, that the
prophecy says I'm supposed to do.

All you have to do

is to believe.

Then you will see everything.

Are you ready, my son?

Yes, I am.

I think.

Then we haven't a moment to lose.

We must assemble... The
Master Builders.

Do you think Zepellins
are a bad investment?

Any of you Fella's seen this guy?

Wait a minute, partner.
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

WANTED

These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

They will go to an Internet cafe
and e-mail

the remaining Master Builders,
who will utilise this in the secret realm

of cloud cuckoo land.

Cuckoo land? But what happened
to that whole training part.

Don't worry, Emmet.
Your training begins now.

You in there open up.
Your training begins later.

On three. 1...

I think we're in the clear.
Freeze, Turkeys

All I want is a piece of resistance.

We You would rather 'he die'
than give it to you.

I would not rather... He died...

Look everybody we can do this
the easy way or we can do it...

Go! Run!! Do it the hard way.

Fire! Fire!

Vitruvius, which way
to cloud cuckoo land.

Head for the big bright thing
in the sky.

You mean the sun? Yeah, yeah,
thats it

lets get out of here. Use this.

What are you doing? Lets go!

I don't know what I'm doing.

Goodbye!

Oh dang!

I've got Pigs!

I hate pigs! Guys quit playing 
around the mud I could use your help

Wild-Style,
I could really use your help.

Oink!

Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something.

Let the Emmet try.
No, let not let Emmet try.

I haven't had any training.
Thats OK.

Let's start with how to become
A Master Builder.

Step 1: Trust your instincts.

Okay. Build-something!

Build something!

Take that

Harness your instincts
are terrible.

No The wheel.

I can't control it much longer.

Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

Spins around round round round
Ohhh

Emmet, where you going?

Hang tight!

Dang damn it.

Well done Emmet!

Hey Haaaay -I did it!
Wow you actually did it!

Train!

Oh no!

Get out off my train.

Wild-Style.

He's gonna ram us.

Quick quick, I have an idea,
Give me that piece.

Now, the ramp.

What the heck?
Rest in pieces.

Ohh No!
Wait! Wait! No no

Hey thanks for saving my life
back there.

Even if, you know eventually 
you turn out to be pointless.

Well for what its worth it.

This has been about the greatest 
15 minutes of my life.

What ...The.

Relax everybody, I'm here.
Batman!

Whats up, babe?
Babe!

What?
Oh sorry. Batman This is Emmett.

Emmet,

Police to meet you, Bad Cop.

The pleasure was all mine.

You big dumb baby

Your car is a baby chariot

Ohh no Your boyfriends gone.

Hey babe. What!! Lets hold hands.

Sooo ahh hey Guys...

I think we're gonna crash into the sun.
Yeh but its gonna look really cool.

Ahh is this cloud cuckoo land?
I don't see any clouds.

Or cuckoos.
No, No, this is middle Zealand.

A Wondrousl land.

Full of knights,
castles, mutton, torture weapons,

poverty, leeches,
Illiteracy and...

Dragon!

Yep, That too.

Once we arrive at cloud cuckoo land.

We'll raise an army of
Master Builders...

Anyway, you guys got to check out 
this new subwoofers I installed in the back

I call it the Dog.
Just listen to them bark.

Can you turn that down a bit?
This is a song I wrote

for Wild-Style

<i>Darkness.
It's about me being an orphan.</i>

<i>No parents</i>

This is real music, Emmet.
The Batman is a true artist.

He's dark, rooting
Well I'm dark and rooting too

Guys, look, a rainbow!
So you gonna drive up the curve part

Take it all the way to the top.

And park the car.

Friends,
welcome to cloud cuckoo land!

Now...

I just need to give
the secret knock.

Okay...

I just want to come right out, 
I have no idea what's going on

Or what is that place is at all.
Hello, I'm am Princess Uni-Kitty

and I welcome you all
to cloud cuckoo land

but theres no signs or anything.
How does anyone know what not to do?

Here In Cloud cuckoo land
there are no rules!

There's no government, no babysitters,
no bedtime.

No frowning faces
No bushy moustaches,

And no negativity of any kind. 
You just said the word 'no'

Like a thousand times. 
and there also no consistency

I hate this place.
Any idea is a good idea,

Except the not happy ones

Those you push down deep inside

where you'll, never, never,
ever find them.

Your fellow Master Builders
are gathered in the dog.

The WHAT?!!

Is that Superman?
Bonjour!

Girl,
What are you doing right now?

It's Superman! Hey, what's up?

Lantern. Green Lantern.
You want to sit together at the meeting?

I have to go back to Krypton.

Didn't Krypton blow up?

My fellow Master Builders,

including, but not limited to
Robin Hood,

Mermaid lady, Gandalf
Swamp creature

1980's ...something space guy.
Hi!

2002 NBA All Stars
and Wonder Woman.

You have traveled far to be here,
for a moment of great importance.

We have learned that Lord Business
plans to unleash a full weaponised Kragle

on Taco Tuesday, to end
the world as we know it.

Please!, calm yourselves.
Green Ninja, Milhouse,

Nice Vampires, Michelangelo,
Michalangelo and Cleopatra.

There is yet one hope,
the Special has arisen.

Have the young man step forward.
As you wish, Dobledore.

I'm the Gandalf.
Its Pronounced Dumbledore.

Dobledore? No! Dumbledore!

You said Dobledore.
Vitruvius!

Time to get away right now, cos I'm not
going to remember any of it...but here we go.

The Special will now
give an eloquent speech.

Go ahead man you got this.

Okay.

Hello, I'm Emmet.

Ohh And this is
the piece of Resistence.

Thank you.

Well ..

I know that I for one am very excited
to work with you guys.

Get into the octant tower

find the Kragle
and put this thing on the thing.

And I know its going to be really
hard...

Really hard?

Wiping your bum with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

This be impossible!

The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business's office.

We used every plan we could conceive.

The result was a massacre too terrible to
speak of.

Who are you? The name be Metal Beard.

I will tell you me tale of woe.
Oh great here we go again.

I arrived at the foot of the tower, with me
hardy Master builder crew

Only to find the Kragle was all the
way up on the infinity-th floor.

Guarded by a Robot army

and security measures of every kind
imagineable.

Lasers.

Sharks.

Laser Sharks.

Overbearing assistants.

And strange dangerous relics 
that entrap, snap, and zap.

And there be a mysterious room
called The Think-tank.

I barely made it out one with just me head

and organs.

Okayyy.
I had to replace every part

my once strapping virile
Pirate body

with this useless hunk of garbage,
You see before you.

So if ye think it be a good idea
to return

to that forsaken place, Special

What idea have you, that be better
than the ideas of 100

of our fallen
Master Builder brothers.

Well technically, I'm not exactly
a Master Builder yet.

WHAT?

Please, everyone ...everyone
Please...

Rubbish. Yeah, it's true.

I may not be a Master Builder,

I may not have a
lot of experience.

Fighting, or leading
or coming up with plans.

Or having ideas in general.

In fact, I'm not all that smart.

And I'm not what you'd call
creative type.

Plus, generally unskilled.

Also, scared, and cowardly.

I know what you're thinking.

He is the least qualified person
in the world to lead us.

And you are right.

Is that supposed to make us feel better?

There was about to be a "but".
You're a but.

You'll all be on your own.

I'll be leaving this lost cause.

Why are you leaving?

A house divided against itself.

Would be better than this.

Abraham Lincoln. You Bring your
space chair right back here.

Come on, guys.

We can still do this, Right?

Well you were right about him being
a ding dong.

Get him outa here.

Well at least it can't get any worse.

I was wrong.

It's the orb of..

Oh-Ohh, its the bad guys.

How did he...
Go!

Come on everyone, protect the special.
Whats that on his angkle?

It's a tracking device.
Take the Master Builders prisoners.

Oh he lead them right to us
Guys, no no it's not my fault

You're the worst leader I have ever seen.
To the Batmobile.

Dang it
To the invisible jet

Dang it
Every man for himself.

No, we have to protect piece.

Shaq, did you know what time it is?
It's game time.

You'all ready for this?

Ohh no they were ready for that.

It didn't break. Because it's Kragled

Machine Gum.

Fire.

I can't move. Don't worry
Superman, I'll get you outa there.

No don't

Ohh my Gosh, my hands are stuck.

My legs are stuck as well.
I super hate you.

Bat, help me out here.
I said, every man for himself.

Hey you gotta be there for me

Fine. Fine. Fine.

I need to have a better attitude about it.
I had a great attitute

The special is in the northwest quadrant,
we've got him cornered.

Where'd he go?

Oh no they have got out cloud stablizers.

Lets go We need to get
Emmet out of here!

Can't we build something?

Hey I'm Ben, but you can
call me Benny.

Can I build a ship. Watch this

No you can't, the skies are surrounded

That's okay, I didn't want to really build 
a space ship anyway that's cool

Where can we go where we can't be found?

Maybe we can go underwater?
What if we went underwater?

Great idea, babe
Thank you, Batman.

Your idea are the best.

But hey I just said that.
We could build a submarine.

A-bat-submarine. Patent bending. 
With rainbows

And dreamcatchers,
in case we take a nap.

Like an underwater spaceship.
But you can't built all of them at once.

Ready? Break!

Okay... These are the colour I make, 
Blue raspberry and sour apple.

If anybody has black parts I need them okay

I only work in black, and sometimes
in very very dark gray.

Use the yellow prints.
You guys can I help?

No, it has to be this way, no I need that

Where is he? Anyone know what this is? 
And do you need it

I could use wings, rocket boosters.
Get our retro space out of my area

You guys hey tell me exactly what to do.
And how to do it.

Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

You must embrace
what is special about you.

There he is. All Units attack the sub

Emmet, get in here.

Stop him!

Don't let them get to the water.

Dive! Dive! Everybody in, 
we're falling under

Oh no.

My home...

It's gone.

I feel something inside its like...

the opposite of happiness.

I must stay positive.

Bubble gum.

Butterflies.

Cotton Candy.

I'm so sorry, Uni-Kitty.

You want to sit down and talk about it?

What the heck is that?

It's a double-decker couch.

Which seemed like a good idea, at the time,
but I now realise, its not super helpful.

But it has cup holders
seat flip up with coolers underneath.

You are so disappointing,
in so many levels.

Why are my pants cold and wet?

The wall are crying. 
We are going to be part of the sea!

This is not how Batman dies.

Emmet, hold on. Hold on. Wild-Style.

Deep breath. Deep breath everyone

Micro-managers, whats going
on down there?

<i> Scanning submarine wreckage </i>

<i> No survivors detected.</i>

Scan the entire ocean of you have to

We've got to find that beast.

Let's take these prisoners back to Lord
Business and give him the good news.

The Special is... no more.

Hello, everbody. Superman
Wonder Woman.

I had no idea you'd be here.

Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
Greetings... ALL.

Welcome to my think-tank.

All Master Builders you 
captured over the years...

You brought them here. -You are a
very perceptive person. Superman.

They've come up with all the instruction 
for everything in the universe

Robots.
No, no!

Can't get much worse than this.

Hello, neighbor! Oh no.

It's Green Lantern! Ohh
My Gosh, we're roomates.

How crazy is that.

Does anyone have some Kryptonite
there, they could give me?

Where is the Special?

The special and the piece of Resistance,
are at the bottom of the ocean.

Are you telling you don't him?

Sir, my scuba teams
are looking for his remains

as we speak.

Bad Cop he could still be alive.
The piece could still be out there.

The only remnants of the Special
was a double-decker couch.

Wait, hold on, a double-decker
couch... Yes, sir.

Really? So its like a bunk-bed couch.
Is that what its like?

Thats weird.

If you're sitting in the top middle

How you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

If you're sitting on the bottom,
and you're watching TV.

Are you're gonna have to walk
rough a bunch of dangly legs.

Who gonna want to
sit at the bottom?

It's literally the most useless
idea I have ever heard.

Well, we're still alive. Yeeeah.
The Doubledecker couch.

It wasn't totally pointless after all. 
Its the one thing that stayed together.

I always believed in you, Emmett.
I don't want to spoil the party...

but does anyone else notice we're stuck in
the middle of the ocean, on this couch?

I mean It's not like a big gigantic ship is just gonna
come out of nowhere and save us. My Gosh!

Alas!..Matey's.

Metal beard I thought you said 
we were a lost cause

You are!

Did you not hear me whole story
cicumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?

That's kinda hard not to hear 
when you're yelling everything.

So why did you come back?
This be double land couch.

I watch Lord Business's forces
completely overlook it.

Which means we need more ideas like it.

Thank you 
Ideas so dumb and bad.

That no one would ever think they could
possibly be useful.

Oh Thank you.
So Special-what we do?

Errr...

Well.

What's the last thing Lord Business

expects Master Builders would do?

Build a Space-ship?
Kill-Chickens?

Marshmallow.
Why, this?

No!!...Its follow the instructions.

No! no! Listen wait. Listen.

Guys you all so talented,
and imagionative.

But, you can't work together as a team.

I'm just a construction worker.

But when I had a plan,

and we're all working together we
could build a skyscraper.

Now you are all master builders.

Just Imagine what could happen
if you did that.

You could save the universe.

Well said, Emmet. Well said!!

Really? This be a fine speech there Laddy.

Okay.

Someone get me some markers.

Some construction paper.

And some giltter glue!

I call this:

Emmet's plan to get inside the tower.

Put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle

and save the world.

I've built a hundreds just
like these back in the city.

If we could just get in there,  I'll know 
where the air-ducts, and wiring are located

I can get us anywhere.

How will we get inside.

In a spaceships. Space-Ships!

Great idea. A Bat-spaceship.
No.

They they are expecting us to
show up in a Bat-Spaceship..

Or Pirate-Spaceship or a
Rainbow-Sparkled-Spaceship

On of those sounds awesome to me.

My idea is to build a Spaceship, that's
exactly like all the other Octant deliveries Spaceships

So now the special Spaceship I am 
building for all of you all right now?

Sorry Benny. Maybe next time.

You really let me oxygen out of my tank here

Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions,

this ship needs a HyperDrive.

We don't have that part
Maybe we could find one.

What do you think a Spaceships
gonna appear out of the blue.

Are you kidding me,
the same thing?

Chewie, we're supposed to be
halfway to Naboo

for a street party. Right now.

This HyperDrive keeps malfunctioning,
taking us to losers system like this.

Captain Solo, we must go, you know 
how they get if we are not punctual.

The droids right. Lets roll.
Now hold on Hans

This mightn't be the right galaxy
after all,

because I see a heavenly body.

Ohh well I have a boyfriend
and it is super serious. Right babe?

Of course it's serious

Got room for just one dude?
Woah, Babe.

If it's a cool dude like you.

You're trying to bail on us?
I'm not trying to bail.

You're asking if you could go 
with them on their party.

<i>That thing is fill wth...</i>

You speak french now? Babe, look

if this relationship ever going to work between us

I need to feel free to party 
with a bunch of strangers,

whenever I feel like it

What? Babe.
I will text you.

Where you'd get that sweet 
space cape, brother?

<i>Party time!</i>

Babe?

Wild-Style...

You're such an amazing person, and you
know if Batman can't see that then.

He's just, He's just as blind..as
a.

A guy who's eyes stopped working.

And let me tell you something, Batman
is the worst person I've ever met.

Need a HyperDrive?
No way!!

I knew it! I knew that
You really had me there!

Those guys are so lame

all I did was play space checkers.

Plus it turned out the hairy one dude
and the metal one to.

All dudes. But wont they notice their 
hyperdrive is missing?

Come on, Chewie.
Hit the HyperDrive.

Nahh They'll be fine.

LET'S MAKE A SPACESHIP!

Step 1: Alright we need a
red 4 piece unit over at the..

Uni-Kitty, you're suppose to follow
the instructions, remember?

Sorry!

This That gives me the goosebumps!
What do I even? I can't!

Nice.

Step 2:

We piloted the ship to the service entrance 
so we can get pass to the dangerous

but also kinda cool laser gate.

Space-ID? I have a drive on.

Who are you here to see
I'm here to see your butt.

Is that the last name BUTT or first name Your an...

First try.

<i>Step 3:
We break into Lord Business's office</i>

and we'll plunder his collection 
of relics for disguises

Step 4: Benny and Metal beard sneak their
way into the master control room.

Motion Sensors triggered
in sector 12. 10-4

Are you thinking what I'm thinking,
Ohhh.

Ohhhh.

Metal-Beard, that was awesome.
First law of the sea.

Never place your rear
end on a pirates face.

Once inside they'll use their
technical knowhow.

To disable the Kragle sheild.

I am a computer.
Cool talking computer!

Please disable the shield systems. 
Of course

There are no movies in 
your area with that title

Step 5: Vitruvius will provide look-out,
to make sure we're not being followed.

OK. Step-6:

Batman and Uni-kitty
go into the boardroom

to make one last change
to Lord Business's plan.

I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that

I second. Bruce Wayne,
C.E.O of Wayne Enterprises.

Bruce Wayne? Who's that?
Sounds like a cool guy.

We'd like to invest in your company. Your weapon to
control the unverse, sounds super-sweet, I must say.

It is. Indeed super-sweet. Cool!
What kind of sound system? Does it have.

Sound System? Well I mean we have an iPod
Shuffle -Wait a second.

Your telling me you have a machine
to control the universe

and you can't listen to tunes in surround
sound.

Embarrassing. Well we - We...

We need to get that done.
I want 8 foot speakers.

Great call. Yeh
I want speakers...

That you can hug
with his arms and your legs

and just feel the beat.

Listen up we need new instruction 
for bigger system for TACO.

We will never help...Whatever you said boss

Then once the instructions,
are printed.

Wild-Style and I will enter
the Kragle room.

Place the thing on the other thing,
and save the universe.

I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

I didn't mention that earlier

when you re-unite the piece with
the Kragle it might explode?

No. But might not, right?

Sure, sure, sure.
Let's go with that.

Attention everybody, incoming 
speaker delivery

Who are you two?
We are transfers from downstairs.

What? Excuse me?

Your robot voice, sounds a
awful lot like a human voice.

Give me a break.
I've never built a robot before.

What do you mean? You
have always been a robot.

No. No. No. Do not listen to her.

What are your robot
serial numbers?

Everything is Awesome.

No way this is my jam.
This is also my jam.

Everything is Awesome.

Everything is good 
When you're part of the team.

Sing. I do not want to sing this song.

Everything is awesome.

Everything is cool
When you're part of the team.

Everything is awesome
when you're part of the team.

Quick, let's go.

I thought you like that song.

I don't

I don't want to put this tough act but I don't think
you're as mean as you're trying to say

ME? I'm not mean. What are you talking 
about? Just saying you were all

He is not special.
He can't possibly be Special.

This guy? Are you kidding?

I don't think thats you.
The real you anyway.

Look, Emmet ...I

I wanted it to be me, ok

I wanted to be the special.

and I know that sounds super
mature, it's just...

Ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the one.

I was right there
in that construction site...

right on top of it, and then...

It turn out to be you.

That night in the city when you thought
that I was the special...

when you said I was
talented and important.

That was the first time
anyone had ever told me that.

It made me want to do everything
I could, to be the guy, ,,

you were talking about.

Lucy. What?

That was my real name.
You asked earlier, and its...

Lucy.

I really like that name.

Hey what are you two losers tallking about?

Oh nothing. Thought I'll help you guys.

Let the weird cat thing to stall

Business, Business, business.
Numbers. Is this working?

Yes! Yay.

There's Bad Cop.

Okay, wait for my signal.
Good luck, Emmet.

Lucy... I think this might
be goodbye.

I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

"See you later, alligator."

"See you later, alligator"?

After a while, crocodile.

Who's Lucy?

Batman, when we get inside the room
there'll be audio sensors everywhere.

We have to be really really quiet

Don't worry dad I read your 
dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me.

Benny, What's the status with the shield?

Yeah it's going great.
If somebody were to listen to me

Downloading the latest episode
"Where are my pants?"

<i>What are you talking about?
You know what I want.</i>

Bad cop.

<i> Hi this is
Lord Business's assistance, </i>

<i>he would like you to come
to his office immediately.</i>

I'll be there thanks. You're welcome sir

Hey who is that?

Thats the signal, but
the shield is still up.

We'll wing it.

Its a Bat punt.

Benny, disable the shield.
Disable the shield. Now.

<i>Disable the shield!
Searching for Albanian restaurant.</i>

<i>No! I never once said anything!
I do not understand what you mean.</i>

Disable the shield!
Benny, what's going on?

<i>Disable the shield. Come on</i>

<i> You are undermining me.
Which phrase would like me to undermine?</i>

Disable the shield. Let me try.

Be he disabling of yon shield.

Disabling shield. What?

Okay. In three.

Two.

One.

Lets do this.

Lucy!

Lucy! No!

Oh man

Sneaking around the corner.

Vitruvius, I see you've accidently
wandered into my Think-tank.

And by the way, I found
a few of your friends.

I wish -I mean, all of them.
Sorry!!

Acceptable work Bad Cop
Thank you, sir.

Robots, destroy this old man
at once.

Did -You just call me old?
Yeah, so what?

Well Junebug I really prefer
the word "experienced".

You see, Emmet?

A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagination...

Vitruvius! No!

Vitruvius. My sweet Emmet, come closer.

You must know something
about the prophecy.

I know, I'm doing
the best, but...

The prophecy...

I made it up. What?

I made it up. It's not true.

That means I'm just...
I'm not the special?

You must listen.

What I'm about to tell you,

will change the course
of history.

No.

Hey, not so special anymore, huh?

Look guess what? No one ever
told me I was special.

I never got a trophy
just for showing up.

I'm not some special little
Snowflake... No!!

But as unspecial as I am...

you are a thousand billion times
more unspecial than me.

Robots bring me the sword
of exact zero.

Yes, Lord Business.
It must be weird.

One minute your the most special
person in the universe.

The next minute you're nobody.

Ohh I have a nice spot for
this, in my relics room.

Ohh ho my mistake. There it goes.

No!

Bye-bye forever.

Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

Release the Kragle.

<i>Computer? Yes, sir.</i>

Set the electric shocker
to 100 Mississipis.

<i>No problems.</i>

And terminate everyone, already on it

Emmet, that should give you enough time to
witness the first location to be Kragled.

Your hometown. No!

Bad Cop, we may have to leave
you here to die.

What? Sir? It's not personal.

It's just business.
Lord Business.

Ciao.

<i>Begin zaping termination in
99 Mississipis.</i>

<i>98 Mississipis. 97 Mississipis.</i>

<i>And so on...</i>

<i>Attention everyone.
This is President Business.</i>

<i>Hello, welcome to Taco Tuesday.</i>

Don't worry about this big
black balloon blocking the sun.

What you need to worry about
is this question.

I'm about to ask you.

Who wants a taco?

Taco! Taco! Go crazy

Alright everyone. Act normal.

Perfect

Now, everybody says "freeze".

So, I guess running around
and screaming, is normal.

Micromanagers,
commence micromanagement.

Commencing micromanagement.

Please. Please...
Won't somebody help us

Emmet you'll think
of something, right?

Like you always do.

Didn't you hear him.

The Prophecy's made up.

I'm not the special.

To think for a moment I might be.

<i>Emmet... Who said that?</i>

I did
I am the ghost of Vitruvius.

Emmet, you didn't let me finish
earlier, because I died ..

The reason I made up the prophecy.

Was because I knew that whoever
found the piece, could become the special.

Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special.

Is to believe, that you can be.

I know it sounds like a
cat-poster but it's true

Look at what you did, when
you believed you were special.

You Just need to believe it
some more.

How can I just decide to
believe, that I'm special.

When I'm not.

Because the world depends on it.

<i>- Zapping termination in 35 mississipis.
What ?</i>

<i>34, 33...</i>

<i>32, 31...</i>

<i>30, 29...</i>

<i>28.27...</i>

<i>26, 25...</i>

Emmet, what are you...

Lucy... Wait, what do you...

Now it's your turn
to be the hero.

Nooo!

See you later-alligator. Don't!

No Emmet!

<i>6...</i>

<i>5, 4...</i>

<i>3, 2...</i>

<i>1, 0... Error.</i>

<i>Termination Failure.</i>

Emmet...

He saved us.

What do we do now? There's gotta
be a bright sight here somewhere

Does anyone have any ideas?

Emmet had ideas.

Arrr if only there were more people
in the world like he.

Maybe there are.

Meet me downstairs in
10 seconds.

AFTER 10 SECONDS

<i>Honey, where are my pants?</i>

Hey guess what found your pants. Series is over.

Benny, send this out to everyone in the universe.

1980's something technology,
Now your talking.

<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

You don't know me,
but I'm on TV,

<i>So you can trust me.</i>

I know things seem kinda bad right now.

But there is a way out of this.

This is Emmet. And he was
just like all of you.

An face in the crowd followed
the same instructions as you.

He was so good at fitting in, 
no one ever saw him

And I owe you an apology.

Because I used to look 
down on people like that.

"I used to think they were

"with no ideas or any vision.."

<i> Because it turns out Emmet <i>
had great ideas.</i>

<i>And even they seemed weird,
and kinda pointless</i>

<i> they actually came closer than anyone 
else to save the universe. </i>

<i>And now we have to finish
what he started,</i>

 <i> By making whatever weird 
things pop into our heads </i>

<i> All of you have the ability inside 
of you to become a ground breaker </i>

<i> and I mean literally
break the ground </i>

<i>Clear up the pices, clear apart your walls</i>

<i>Build things only you can build,
defend yourselves.</i>

<i>We need to fight back against 
President Business's plan to freeze us.</i>

<i> Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday</i>

<i>It will be known as freedom friday.</i>

But still on a Tuesday!

End of the line.

Bad Cop?

I hope there's still a good cop
in me somewhere else.

I'll hold these guys up. 
You go stop em yeyy!

Great idea,
but how will we get there?

I could...

I could build. I could build a spaceship.

Your not gonna say no? Build away!
Whatever your name is.

Spaceship!

Spaceship!

Spaceship. Spaceship!

Spaceship!

All units, attacking that Spaceship.

Spaceship!

Where did he go? Space-Ship!

Wild-Style, look! It's the citizens.

Tally hoe

And the Old West.

And don't forget us Master Builders.

What is going on?

You stop building! Just stop it!

Great job. This might actually work.

It was your speech with 
rouse this hearty crew

If only Emmet we here to see this

He'd say something adorable like...



<i>Forever.</i>

It is another vision?

Where am I?

Is that the Office tower?

What was that?

No.

The spaceship!

What in the world is that?

It's adorable.

Oh Ohh.

No! No!

Don't eat me!, Do not eat me
Do not eat me. Please!!

Hi, Emmet.

Hi?

Is this?

The man...

The man upstairs.

What happened?

No, no. This is a disaster.

Why... What?

What?

Why a dragon on top of the development?

I was just playing.
I know it's hard to understand,

but this is dads stuff OK?

All of this that you see before you
is all your fathers.

And everything is thought out...

What did you do down here? Did you the top off of the tower?
It was an accident.

You accidentally.

Expertly, carefully took the
entire top off of the tower?

Yes.
You know the rules.

You know the rules this is not a toy.
I kind of is... NO!!

Actually its a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

But we bought it at the toy store.

We did but the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

The box says that is for 8-14

Thats a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

You can't expect me to be able 
to resist playing with all this?

Look move your stuff over to
the Christmas decorations.

All those bricks, you
can build anything you want.

Finn, we gonna play a little game.

It's called: "let's put everything
back the way you found it."

But Dad, you don't understand.

So I can make things the way they're
supposed to be..

Permanently.

More Kragle?

This rebellion ends right right now!

Oh . No! Stop.

Fire in the hole.

Wait, what is happening?
We're going down

Mayday! Stop!

Hold on, We're coming for ya!

Stop. oh no.

Too Many micromanagers.

What am I holding here?

It's a battle ship. No, its a
hodge podge that's what it is.

Whats Batman on it?
What is this a robot pirate?

Stop it!, No stop it. Stop!

I thought I glued over the constructor worker.

Here, give that to me.

Stop it!

<i>All those were my friends, stop it.</i>

We were a hearty crew but it be

It be over.

No!

A Piece of Resistance.
I can still save them.

Let's get this..off this 
construction worker

He's not just a construction worker dad
He's a hero.

Nope he's not.

He is a ordinary, regular,
generic construction worker.

And I need to put him back, where he belongs

Now where is my exacto knife.

I gotta get the piece of resistance.

If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature...

I gotta move.

Where is that?

Alright...

Dad?
Yes.

I think I saw the exact in little Zealand.

Ohh-Great. Thank you.
You're welcome.

It up to you now, Emmet.

but its true.

Sorry, street.

See your friends?
They are finished.

My world is almost finished.

The last thing I need to do,
is finish you.

No stop please, if you do one more thing
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

Your secret weapon?
Yes.

It is called
The Power of the Special.

That sounds dumb.

Alright? Here it comes.

My secret weapon Is this.

What is that? Is it super small,
I don't see anything.

Its my hand.
I like you to take it.

You want to take your hand off?
No, I want you to join me.

Look at all these things that people built.

You might see a mess.

Exactly. And a bunch of weird dorky stuff
that ruined my perfectly good stuff.

Okay, what I see.

Are people, inspired by each
other

and by you...

People taking what you made.

And making something new out of it.

Finn, did you make all of this?

Well I tried stop President Business,

from using the Kragle.

What's the Kragle.

Its in there.

This?

OFF LIMITS

DO NOT TOUCH

HANDS OFF

So...

President Business
is the bad guy?

If...

The construction guy.

Said something to President Business...

What would he say?

You don't have to be.

The bad guy.

You are the most talented,

most interesting,

and the most extraordinary person
the universe.

And you are capable of
amazing things.

Because you are the special.

And so am I.

<i>And so is everyone.</i>

<i>The prophecy is made up.</i>

<i>But it's also true.</i>

<i>It's about all of us.</i>

Right Now, it's about you.

And you still...

can change everything.

We got a hugger.

Be Careful.

I have been told
it might explode.

Emmet, thank you

I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart.

From this moment forward I solemnly
promise that I will never...

Emmet!
Hey. Everyone okay?

Emmet wait. Batman...

Theres something I need to say to you.
