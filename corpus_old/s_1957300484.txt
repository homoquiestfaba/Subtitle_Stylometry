(ominous music)

Is any of this even necessary?

That dipshit'll
be dead before me.

Him again?

Fine.

The date is February 23rd, 1982.

Can I get some snacks in here?

Son, 18 years and nine
months ago you were conceived

on the Gadbury Ice

and you've been the bane
of my existence ever since.

When I was alive, I
lay awake at night

wishing I had pulled out and
let you melt into the ice.

As the saying goes,
spilled semen.

You've enjoyed the finer
aspects of the Gadbury name

while never fulfilling
your family duties.

Our legacy as curling
elite goes back centuries

and now I'm afraid
that will die.

As my final farewell to you,

I'll give you one
last opportunity

to prove you are a Gadbury.

And if not, your
sweet half baby sister

will receive my whole fortune.

Maybe by the time you've
seen this, you will have-

I've been saving this,
my little caliente.

[Father] Whoa.

Rapido papi.

(sexy music)

Yes.

(upbeat music)

(victorious music)

Come on, come on, come
on, come on, push yourself.

(victorious music)

Push yourself!

(victorious music)

I want to see them titties

bouncing from your toenails
to your temples, tubby.

(victorious music)

Why you stop, man?

What?

Come on man, it's hot.

Hot?

Man, check the ladder.

Dang.

(victorious music)

Fuck is he doing?

What is you doing?

I prefer baseball.


Lunch porky.

And you!

Whatever it is you
selling, I ain't buying.

I ain't selling, I'm serving.

What the fuck is this?

This bitch open my mail.

Pay your house
payment, you broke bitch.

What is this?

But I will get away with it.

My brain is a catalog of
Datelines and 48 Hour Mysteries.

(speaking in foreign language)

That's right bitch,
I'm drowning you.

That's my money, my inheritance,
every single penny of it.

You little bastard.

That's my money, you're
not getting any of it.

Drowning me again, puto?

Did you know about the tape?

Why didn't you tell me?

(speaking in foreign language)

Because you're a piece of
shit that only took from dad.

He didn't want you
to have that money.

You don't even deserve it.

That's not true.

I'm the true heir to
the Gadbury throne.

You never even went on
the ice to throw with us.

Do you even curl?

It's in my blood.

Okay, so when's the last
time you went on the ice?

Exactly, I thought so.

You were too busy
fucking your mattress

and eating your damn Twinkies

to be part of the
family business.

That's not true.

It's all mine.

Listen up dipshit,

the lawyer is here and needs
you to sign some papers

so you're aware of
the terms, okay?

So you're gonna get ready,

you're gonna meet
me in the office

'cause Brett is waiting for us.


(ominous music)

(speaking in foreign language)

What's taking him so long?

He's gonna be here,
don't worry about it.

Look at him.

What?

You know I have low blood sugar?

Gordon, shut up
and sign the papers.

Gordon.

I'm here to explain the
conditions of the trust.

Your father left
explicit instructions

that upon his death

the only way to receive
your inheritance,

which is valued
at $125.8 million,

is if you lead a curling team

to the regionals of
the Olympic trials.

That is the good news.

Then what's the bad?

The bad is the qualifiers
for the regionals

its in one month.

What?

Looks like you
better get going.

(tense music)

How in the world am I gonna
put together a team this fast?

Gordon, I can be of
service if you need.

How's a blow job gonna help me

put together an all
area curling team?

Couldn't hurt.

I meant with teammates.

I happen to know a couple of
unemployed curlers in the area

who'd be available
for the right price.

Money is no object.

Done.

I'll get in touch
with you, okay?

Thank you.
No problem.

Fat boy, this is $45.

With the promise of a million.

How?

All we have to do is
get to the regionals,

expose my sister
for the fraud she is

and the $125 million is mine.

That shit is a month away.

We better get to it then.

Get yo ass out my house.

The bee don't get out
the bed for less than,

let's think $1,500.

Tell you what?

$1,000 a week.

Cash only tubby.

I'll get you your money.

(women yelling)

Who is that?

Oh that's Gerri Redding.

Let me be.

Get off me, get off me.

Get off me.

Gerri Redding,

the first female
drafted to the NFL.

NFL?

Professional football, man.

We didn't watch the
sports of the commoners.

Well, right after she was
drafted, she went crazy,

drugs, hookers.

She didn't even
get to play a game.

Where can I find her?

County fool.

(mysterious music)

Are you the one
that bailed me out?

Yes.

Listen, I
appreciate it and all,

but I don't get down like that.

I'm sorry?

With dicks, your dick.

I'm not gonna suck
it or nothing.

This is a no dick zone,

not here, not here,
not here, not nowhere.

No, if I wanted a blowjob

I'd get a much
better looking guy.

This is strictly professional.

Have you ever thought

about playing a true
professional sport?

Man I ain't got time
for the bullshit today.

Listen, I'm giving
you the opportunity

to elevate your physical prowess

to play a sport of
the gods, curling.

Man, let me get
out of this bitch.

I'm out.

(upbeat music)

Oh that looks
like a good site.

Wow, she's pretty.

(upbeat music)

She sweeps like an angel.

Hello Amor.

I have a proposito for you.

(upbeat music)

Pop!

Pop!

Pop!

Geraldine, why you sneak
in my house like that?

I been calling your name.

I'm trying to get
a little shut eye

for my studio session tonight.

What's wrong, baby girl?


I need your help.

You know the training ain't
going like as planned.

You mean them fucked
up tires in the yard?

No shit.

They about to take the house.

You had it all,
first woman in the NFL

and you had to fuck it up

with them phat asses and blunts.

I ain't come here to get a
lecture from black country.

Yeah, I'm singing
country music.

I'm 'bout to change
the game, just like-

Ray Charles?

You ain't no Ray Charles.

Damn right.

He's six feet under
and I'm still standing.

I would love to help you

but I got all my money tied
in the video shoot next month.

I spent my life on your dreams.

Now I got to do mine, Geraldine.

Now just listen to my new song.

â™ª Come on home little
darling I love â™ª

Damn Geraldine, I was just
getting to the good part.

Man, I'll listen later.

As soon as this gets sold,

we gonna be back on
top, I'm telling you.

Man whatever.

(upbeat music)

What the?

Hell no.

(speaking in foreign language)

Who you calling limp?

Your mama.

(speaking in foreign language)

Yo, yo, shut the fuck up.

You made it!

Yeah, I made it, we good.

That direct deposit
went through.

Gordo, what the fuck?

This is wood.

(speaking in foreign language)

Gordo is a bit
harsh, don't you think?

(speaking in foreign language)

Why are we practicing wood?

It's an old Gadbury secret.

If you can practice on
wood, the ice is a breeze.

That's the stupidest
shit I ever heard.

I'm out.

I guess you could send
that money back then, huh?

It's not just about
hitting the bullseye.

It's about keeping the other
team out of here as well.

Fat boy, I'm the black
curling world champion.

Give me the God damn broom.

Well who's gonna
throw the stone?

(speaking in foreign language)

You better float
your ass down the wood.


(speaking in foreign language)

I don't know.

Let me take care of him though.

Gordo, I'll throw
the stones for now

but we need to find
somebody ASAP, cool?

I got some cookies in
the back for you too.

Come on, pep up, Gordo.

(mysterious music)

(crowd applauding)
(dramatic music)

(upbeat music)

Who are these people?

Well you know
the beached whale

and that half naked gentlemen
got suspended for three years

for selling trades
to the Canadians.

And well that, that's the help.


Well done, tons of fun.

Looks like you're
just one practice away

from world domination.

Eat a shit sandwich,
Smellsmerelda.

Oh, touchy big brother,

being poor is keeping
you up at night?

Hey Gordon, sorry
to disturb practice.

Why do you even hang
out with my sister, Brett?

Well I, I work for her.

They used to call
her a gang banger

and not 'cause she reps a set.

Can we get on with it?

As part of the agreement,

you are to cease and desist
all use of family funds.

What?

Oh, you haven't told
your little butt buddies

that you're poor?

(speaking in foreign language)

The man is poor meaning
zippo, zero, nada.

I will circumcise you again.

Do you understand
these conditions?

Yes.

Okay, can we go now?

(dark music)

No

I can't stand him.

Nice pooch.

Don't let this
outfit fool you.

I'll snatch your
life, rich bitch.

(dark music)

That was awesome.

Man, let's hurry up and
get this show on the road.

Your girl baking
bread down here.

(dark music)

Make sure that linebacker
bitch doesn't get in my way.

I know she played a little
linebacker in high school.

(speaking in foreign language)

How are you?

I'm doing well, thank you.

I was just looking
over these plans

and we're soon gonna have
the premier curling facility

in the world right
here in South Florida.

And it's all thanks
to your beautiful,

generous $100 million donation.

Commissioner Pottinger,
you are too kind.

I would be remiss if I
didn't give all that I have

to the curling community here

after all it's
done for my family.

Well, I can't
thank you enough.

What am I 'posed to do?

I love your enthusiasm.

Everything you need to know

is right here in this
instructional video.

(upbeat music)

That's some bullshit.

Come on, let's
go, you got this.

(upbeat music)

All right, there you
go, remember your form.

(upbeat music)


(upbeat music)


(upbeat music)

(speaking in foreign language)

Gerri, you got a minute?

What?

Look, I know practice

didn't go as well as
you would've liked but-

But nothing.

We suck. I suck.

If you want, we can stay late
and I'll help you practice.

Nah man, I got to
find a job, Gordo.

Man, I got problems.

This is fine and all,

but if I don't
work, I don't eat.

Look, I know this isn't much-

No man, no, I can't.

Listen, if we're
gonna win this thing,

I need you here and here.

Are you sure?

If it'll keep you focused
and off the streets then...

(upbeat music)

Have you ever felt like
magnetically involved

with another?

Exactly.

Are you gonna tip me
for a dance or what?

Did you even dance?

Yeah, five or six dances ago.

Look, I'm gonna
be up there soon.

Just give me a few dollars

and I'll just consider
it down payment.

Hell no.

You're not gonna
invite me for a drink?

No.

(speaking in foreign language)

I've been cooling over
here by myself vibing.

Get the fuck out my booth.

Okay, okay, leaving.


Bitch, what the
fuck is you doing?


Excuse me, you
got a problem here?

She offered me a drink

and then she got crazy.

Man, she drank
out of my bottle.

You can't be
threatening the dancers.

Man.


I just-

What the fuck was that?

I already bailed you out once

and now I got to
bail you out again

'cause you punched a
stripper in the face?

First off, I
ainâ€™t punch nobody.

Look, it doesn't even matter.

We don't have to be friends.

We don't even have
to like each other.

Once we win the regionals,
you're off the hook,

but I'm not bailing
you out again.

You call yourself an athlete?

What you say?

We're a week away
from this match

and you're still sweeping
like a light skin.

Can you even wrap
those thick ass fingers

around a broom and sweep?

I'll wrap my hands
around your peanut head you

(speaking in foreign language)

Y'all break that shit up.

This the most hood shit

I ever been a part of.

You thought you was gonna
teach this how to throw.

What that posed to mean?

It's cool, you made
the league barely.

To be a curler,

you need heart

and the whole world know
you don't have that.


Ooh, ooh, ooh.

Gerri, no, Gerri come on.

I need him, I need you both.

Gerri, I need you both.


For the love of
the broom!

Get up off me, Sasquatch.

I'm out of here, Gordo.

I'mma go home, get
my dick sucked,

eat some cereal, get a
manicure and count some money.

Teach these scrubs how to throw.

And make sure you grow,

short ass bitch.
Fuck you.

Man, I'm outta
here, I'm tired.

Gordon, good to see you.

[Gordon] You too.

Your sister was just
telling me about the

eclectic team that
you've assembled.

Fucking trash.

I'm trying out a
new type of athlete

for this year's games.

That team of yours

is only going to bring down our
family name with that hooker

and that manimal you have.

Eat shit.

Hey Gordon.

She is a bastard.

My old man was
banging the maid when-

(speaking in foreign language)

Really?

Well, I guess I have
to thank you as well

for the generous donation.

No, no, no, no
need to thank him.

He's done nothing.

I took a shit in your
bathroom, no flush.

It was Taco Tuesday.

Gordon.

Well, if that's everything,
I've got to get back to work.

So we'll be seeing
you at the regionals.

Thank you commissioner.
Thank you commissioner.

Gordon.

Thank you.

Wait, you did wash
your hands, right?

(mysterious music)

Get a good night's rest.

You're gonna need all your
strength for tomorrow's match.

Yeah, whatever.

Can I give you
a ride somewhere?

â™ª So come on home,
little darling â™ª

â™ª I love you

â™ª I didn't mean
to make you cry â™ª

â™ª I know I drink and gamble
and run around town â™ª

â™ª But my little darling,
I'm gonna settle down â™ª

Glad you could
make it, Geraldine.

What's good, pops?

How's it going?

'Bout finished up now.

On the last scene.

This is my partner, Anna.

Hi I'm Coach Gordon.

God damn, you mighty
piggly mother fucker.

Well it takes one to know one.


Thanks for giving baby girl

another shot at the big game.

You coming out
for the big match?

Never missed any of her
games, not gonna start now.

I've got to get back to work.

So I'll catch up
with you guys later.

Alright.

(country music)

I want to thank you again
for a delightful performance.

I'm glad y'all made it.

You know, that Gerri's
really something special.

One of the best
athletes I ever seen.

That's no lie.

But you know what they say?

Pussy is a mother fucker's
quickest downfall.

Take care of my girl, all right?

She's an asshole I know,

but there ain't
nothing she can't do

if she put her mind
to it and that include

Curling.

Curling?

When they sweeping
on ice and shit?


That ain't no sport.

I met as well get my fat
ass out there and do it.

Please do me a favor

and get her home soon

so she can be on time
for the match tomorrow.

And Gerri, eight
a.m., don't forget.

(upbeat music)

They're late.

And where have you been?

(speaking in foreign language)

Fuck man, this is
America, speak English.

(speaking in foreign language)

This is Miami.

(speaking in foreign language)

Where are you?

(speaking in foreign language)

(alarm blaring)
(ominous music)

Those bitches robbed me!

Fuck!

Shit!

(dramatic music)

What the hell?

Man, bitches ain't shit.

Hey, nice tits, Gordo,
long time, no see.

Who's this fuck boy?

Woah, I don't want any
beef with you, sir.

Sir?

This is the captain
of the All Curl Revue,

our opponents today.

So maybe afterwards

I might let you take
this for a spin.

I gotta a spin for your ass.

[Brett] Gordon!

Give me a minute.

(ominous music)

I have to say that I am
truly disappointed in you.

What did you do?

Just told them about
your little scam.

Paying players in an
amateur tournament.

(speaking in foreign language)

Shame on you.

And I was truly
rooting for you, Gordon,

but this is disgraceful.

You've got 15 minutes
find a new player

or you're gonna have to forfeit.

(ominous music)

What did you do?

What the fuck
you done did now?

(speaking in foreign language)

I had to come
clean, Gordo, my bad.

My bad, what?

What's going on?

Rico just got disqualified.

(speaking in foreign language)

No, your money just
got us disqualified.

What did my sister give you?

(mimics buzzing)

You knew how much
this meant to me.

Got a way better deal though.

Better deal, huh?


What is happening here?

That beast just physically
assaulted someone.

[Gerri] Bitch!

The whole team
should be disqualified.

Call me out my name again

and yo ass gon' be next.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

Enough is enough, okay?

It's time.

Either you have a third
party or you're disqualified.

(dramatic music)

I'm gonna get you bitch.

(suave club music)

Come on, you got this.

(club music)

I put the faith on you.

Fuck up dem gigalos!

Go soft and try to
split their stones

and try to knock their
top one out of place.

And Nina, sweep hard to the left

so that the stone
picks up any speed.

Got it?
Okay, okay.

(club music)

Eat shit, gigolos.

(club music)


(club music)

Come on, Geraldine,
get it going.

Practice run.

It's okay Nina.

(speaking in foreign language)

Me?

(speaking in foreign language)

You're sweeping
is embarrassing.

I'm starting to think

your online sweeping
business is bullshit.

Man, how long
we gotta do this?

It's eight rounds.

Didn't you learn
anything from that video?

No.

Curl harder, curl harder.


(club music)

You shit gigolo.

(club music)

This is it.

We have to make
every point count.

Gerri, you hit it
from the inside

and Nina will bring
it home for the win.

(club music)

Fuck up those gigolos.

(club music)

Now those guys know
how to fucking curl.

That's some bullshit.

Well, it was
hard fought match.

Good effort.

Anyway, don't hang
your head ladies.

Got another two weeks
and try it again.

Who are we playing?

Only the top team
in south Florida.

The So Flow Curls?

Who are they?

(speaking in foreign language)

Only one of the top
teams in the country.

They migrated Minnesota
to South Florida

during the cold winter of 2000.

And they haven't lost a
match in 20 years. (laughs)

You know every time
you open your mouth

I want to knock your
teeth out, bitch.

(speaking in foreign language)

Can I borrow you for a minute?

Of course.

Eight o'clock
tomorrow morning.

And how are we
supposed to beat them?

Faith.

Man, get the fuck out.

We done.

Where have you been?

Well I had a few
errands this morning.

I started with the dry cleaner.

Zip it.

And you, you were worried.

Well, I have to
admit I was worried

but after watching
Gordon and those idiots

I am sure that we're
gonna make South Florida

the center of the curling
world with his inheritance.

Hey, is he gonna be okay?

No, he's entering
funnel territory.

Funnel?

(quirky music)

Our father was a strict man

and he always pressured Gordon

into taking over
the family business.

And when Gordon would
disappoint, which was always,

he would turn to the funnel.


He's gonna die.

Not soon enough.

(soft music)

(phone ringing)


Hey.

Who in the hell
call somebody

at five o'clock in the morning?

Is somebody dead?

Oh, all right, I'll be there.

Oh shit.

(mysterious music)

What in the hell are
you doing Geraldine?

Pops, what's good?

Can I get you one of these?

Girl, ain't you got
practice tomorrow?

Man that shit over.

Girl, where you
get all this money?

So I called the
addiction specialist.

They taught me to control
my booty cravings.

What's wrong with you?

It ain't over.

There's one more game.

You was there yesterday.

You was there.

We finished.

When you gonna stop

giving up on yourself
before you start?

Oh so now you care?

Now you want to be a dad?

I'm always your dad.

Where was you after the draft?

When I lost everything,
where was you?

You forgot all I did for you?

You made the draft
because of me.

Yeah, you was a good
coach or whatever,

but when I needed a
dad, you wasn't there.

Man, take your ass home unless
you want to pay for this.

I'll take her home.

She grown, not
my problem anymore.

(speaking in foreign language)


What is you doing
in my house, stripper?

It's Lola, honey.

That don't answer
why you in my house.

I told your papa I would
take care of you last week

so (giggling)

A week, last week?

Yeah, you've been
in a coma for 10 days.

I've being here
taking care of you.

I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

Okay, mi amor?

What's going on?


I can't move my legs.

Oh yeah, you were
temporarily paralyzed

but I nursed you back to health.

Who else in my house?

Well I had to take the
week off to take care of you

so I had to conduct some
business out of our house.

And tada!

Ready?

Hop on.

Bitch, didn't I say
I can't move my legs?

(gentle music)

There you go.

What these ho's
doing in my house?

I ain't no ho,
control your girl.

Relax.

You, we're guests.

Do not disrespect.

Look, they were gonna
take your house.

So me and my girl, we had
to make some extra money.

You're welcome.

We set up in here.

But don't worry, I locked her
bedroom through the parties.

Parties?

Big ones.

Mmhmm, we entertained
a couple of times

just to make some money.

I couldn't leave you alone.

I needed to work from home.

Home?

This my house.

Ain't nobody come by?

Yeah, your dad, he did
come a couple of times.

He actually stayed
for the parties.

Okay hot pudding,
let that booty roll.

And my team?

About that...


Thank you for a nice evening.

Why are you so distant?

You were never like this before.

Man, I was in a coma.


Where's Gordo?

You lived,

What a shame.

Move bitch.

You know you can't roll
up into my house like this.

You know my brother's very
sick and he can't be disturbed.

You're gonna let (speaking
in foreign language).

You know you can't help
that fat fuck anyway.

What happened?

The inevitable, tubo
ate himself to death.

Get up coach, man, we
still got work to do.

Isn't that precious?


Something's happening.

Nothing, it's feeding time.

(gentle music)

Come on, big guy,

I know you in there somewhere.

Wake up!


Guacamole, is that you?

What happened?

Just don't move, okay?

Relax.

Gerri?

I'm here, coach.

Coach?

Coach.

(gentle music)

Do something.

No stop, oh my God.

But,

how?

This ain't my first coma.

Let's get the band
back together.

And how the hell
am I supposed to go?

You'll be walking
within five hours max

and don't worry, the night
terrors go away in a few weeks.

He woke up.

I know, the pig in
the blanket won't die.

You better take care of him.

If not, the curling
center and the money,

it all goes up in smoke.

(dark music)

(upbeat music)

Nina, we're here to rescue you

from a life of
indentured servitude.

(speaking in foreign language)

It don't look like
she want to be saved.

Human trafficking is no joke.

You of all people
should understand that.

What that supposed to mean?

We will protect you.

Run to your freedom.

(speaking in foreign language)

All right,

She won't be needing this.

That's going with me.

Well that's it,
I'm officially poor.

Where do you guys
get your food stamps?

So you just gonna give up?

(speaking in foreign language)

You know a good
restaurant around here?

Last one buys.

Not it.

Oh, not it.

(speaking in foreign language)

I think I know a spot.

(mysterious music)

(speaking in foreign language)

Yeah, pops talked
to the owner,

we can practice here.

Enough grab ass,
let's get to work.

(upbeat music)


Yeah, mother fucker!
Yeah!

(upbeat music)

(country music)

What the hell are you doing?

You bout to be a big sister.

Are you serious?

Yes, little mulato on his way.

Bruh.

Shit, I still got the thunder.

Come on, man.

You better sit your old ass down

before you gone through
your hip out of place.

Have a toast with me.

To the family and
the fire in my loins.

Come on, man, it ain't
got to be all that.

Now I know you didn't
just come over here

just to have a drink
with your old man.

What's on your mind?

I just wanted to
make sure we was good.

You're an asshole

but you always gonna
be my child so we good.

I'm gonna be there
cheering you on

like I have all your life.

Thanks pop.

You know this
don't change things

how I care about you?

Man, listen, I'm
almost 40 years old.

If you want to be
running around here

with little jits in
your '70s, be my guest.

Geraldine, you
don't understand.

It's nice to have a
little love in the house.

Plus, my new medicine

put a little lead back
in the old pencil.

Man, why you?

We're gonna give those
misfits a good spanking,

South Florida style.

And what do you
think about that?

I think it's blasphemy

It's a mockery of a good sport

and they think that
they can just show up

and learn how to
sweep in a few weeks.

And that football
player, Gerri, is it,

what cage did they
find her from?

Gerri, go back to
the black sports.

That was a tad racist.

Back to you, Ted.

What the fuck
they talking 'bout?

Beat their mother fucking
ass tomorrow, Geraldine.

(whimsical music)

Let me guess.
Geez.

You slept walked
into the kitchen again?

I had a light dinner.

Mmhmm.

What are you doing up?

Somebody in this family has
to put in some actual work

while you eat yourself to death.

Ugh, I've had enough,
I'm going to bed.

Good luck tomorrow, loser.

Bitch.

(tense music)

A land deal with
Commissioner Pottinger?

South Florida Curling Complex?

(tense music)

What are you doing here?

I can't wish my
brother good luck?

Look, it's a big day and all

and I thought that you should
have dad's curling broom

for the big match.

Aw.

Nighty night, big brother.

You will not fuck
this deal up for me.

(upbeat music)

(gentle music)

(speaking in foreign language)

Whatever the fuck you said.

Oh hey pops.

Ain't mine.

What?

That baby.

I made sure of that.

I only do anal at
the strip club.

I'm not pregnant, okay?

I'm here with mi amor.

My Geraldine?

Yeah, we just had a
connection, you know?

And the sex, and the sex is-

Not another damn word.

Like father, like daughter.

What the shit is this?

We curling on the
soccer field now?

(speaking in foreign language)

Man, how long you
been in America?

You don't speak English yet?

(speaking in foreign language)

The fuck?

What is you doing here?

Hi, mi amor.

I'm working the day
shift so I thought

I'll take my break
to watch you play.

Oh no.

Geraldine, you
up with this ho?

I ain't no ho, okay?

I've changed since we've
been living together.

Geraldine, you've got
this ho up in your house?

Our house.

I pay the rent.

Good luck this afternoon.

Where's cankles?

He'll be here.

One can only hope so.

Yeah, she's a diddy bitch.

(upbeat music)

God damn Nazis are coming.



(clears throat)

There you are.

So is everything in order?

You have nothing
to worry about.

Let's just you say
Gordon is dead tired.

Perfect.

[Female] I think he looks

really cute in yellow.
That's what I think.

Where's your portly
third member?

Or is this on the team now?

This?

I have a pistola in my
bolsa, little bitch.

Mmm, gang violence in curling,

that's a first.

Oh he'll be here.

He better hurry, the
match is about to start.

Although it won't matter.

Afterwards, I'm gonna have

your little lady
friend here deported.

Que?

Adios muchachos.

Man, fuck these clowns.

(tense music)


Help, help, help!

Pop, we can't find Gordon.

He probably dead.

Man, why would you say that?

A man that big.

Pop.

Aight, I'll go check on him.

I'll drive.

I know where he stays.

Got to make sure
mi amor is fine.

Y'all hurry up,
hurry up, come on.

Damn, man.

So hungry.

God, hurry it up there.

I'm going.

I see lights coming.

Help, I'm in here!

Hurry up.

You know I'm black as night.

They done called the
police already.

I'm doing it.

Just relax.

Yes, yes.

I'm in here!

Get these things off me.

Thank God.

There we go.


(tense music)

Well ladies, can't hold
this match up any longer.

If Gordon is not here in
the next five minutes,

got to forfeit the match.

What's the concern everyone?

I know you did this,
you raggedy ass bitch.

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

I'm gonna knock your ass out

before the day over
with, believe that.

I'm so scared.

Let's not do that.
Wait, wait, I'm here.

(victorious music)

Mmhmm.


He ran out of time as he
ran his fat ass from the car.

Commissioner, call the match.

I'm here.

I'm here.

I'm (barfing)

What the fuck?

Someone clean this up.

It's only bacon,
it'll come right out.

Oh God damn it.

I'm ready.

Well, I guess the match is on.

(upbeat music)

All right, here we are.

Now you know the rules.

Great Gadbury's,

if you lose this match,

you are eliminated and will
not move on to regionals.

So Flow Curls, are you ready?

Yeah.

Great Gadbury's,
are you ready?

[All] Yeah.

Hell yeah.

All right, well let's
get ready to curl.

Hoes before bros. (laughs)

That ain't even
how that shit go.

(clock ticking)
(tense music)

Now, I grew up
with these D-bags.

Let's try to block 'em at
the top of the bullseye

and we've got a chance.

Now you now you ain't
grow with these kids

with your old ass

but it's good to
have you back, Gordo.

(speaking in foreign language)

Break!

(tense music)

Come on girls,
there's still time.

I know we can do this.

We've practiced so hard.

All right, everyone.

That's half time.

Take 10.

Save the embarrassment
and quit now.

There's no turning
back after this.

Gadbury's never quit.

Save that talk for
the soup kitchen.

Come on girls, I
know we're down, but-

We done.

They some real white boys,

we can't beat that.

We just have to
have some faith.



Party time.

(tense music)


(gunfire blasting)


(gunfire blasting)



His dick.

Sven's dead.

Oh my God, something
happened to him, he's dead.

What the hell?

What's going on?

This isn't good.

So what do we do?

Well I,

So Flow Curlers, if you don't
have another player then

you're gonna have to forfeit.

What do you mean?

Sven is dead.

Who would do that?

No, no, no, no, no,
we need to reschedule.

You need to
reschedule the match.

No, I understand but
curling waits for no one.

So the winner who goes
on to the regionals is

the Great Gadbury's.

What, I couldn't hear you?

I said the Great Gadbury's?

(upbeat music)

You animals, he's dead.


This cannot be happening.

I'm rich.

We got it all, all
our money, that's mine.

(speaking in foreign language)

Yes.

Gordon, this is for you.

(tense music)

Where the fuck have
you been all day?

Funny story-


That shit don't
happen in black sports.

(ominous music)

Son, I'm assuming you failed

to complete the task I gave you

so I sent in a spy
to assure your win.

You're too important to the
Gadbury name to be a loser.

If any nefarious
activity took place,

you will find in the
safe a signed pardon

by my pal Ronald Reagan.

The fortune is yours,
Gordon, all of it.

I'll be damned if I
let a fat backside

and a tongue that rolls her R's,

oh those R's,

damned if I let that
spoil the Gadbury name.

You're an idiot but
you're my fat idiot.

Papa.

My final order of business,

get that maid's daughter off
the premises immediately.

The Gadbury's get blackmailed
by no one, no one.

We do the blackmailing
around here

and don't you ever forget it.

I miss you so much.

(upbeat music)

This is ridiculous.

I demand to return
to my house now.

Not so fast, little sis.

What is that supposed to mean?

As of five minutes ago,

Gordon is officially sole
heir of the Gadbury throne.

This includes his $125.8
million and all other assets.

Oh, Gordo, you are rich.

You better share.

You speak English?

Yeah.

What about me?

I regret to inform you your
father left you with nothing.

You broke.


What?

(speaking in foreign language)

So she broke?

And what are you
gonna do about it?

(speaking in foreign language)


(upbeat music)

(ominous music)

Oh shit.

That big bitch.

I will have my revenge.

(upbeat music)

â™ª Lord of mercy

(singing in foreign language)

â™ª What's your name

â™ª I don't know

(singing in foreign language)
