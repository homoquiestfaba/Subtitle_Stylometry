AND SO THE LAST HOPE FOR VICTORY
RESTS ON THE SHOULDERS

OF THE YOUNGEST HOCKEY PLAYER
EVER TO TURN PRO...

CHARLIE BOYLE!

HE TAKES THE PUCK FROM MESSIER,
KNIFING THROUGH ALL-STAR
DEFENSE,

GREASING PAST GRETZKY,
LEAPIN' LINDROS.

IN THE DUST!
JUST HIM AND THE GOALIE NOW,

MANO A MANO.

HE SHOOTS...

HE SCORES!

THE CROWD GOES WILD
IN THE ARENA.


HEY, CHARLIE.
OH. HEY, DAD,

HEY, COME HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHIN'.

WELL, YOU MAKE IT QUICK.
THAT'S A NICE SHOT.

THANKS. I'VE BEEN
WORKIN' ON A TECHNIQUE

THAT MAXIMIZES
PUCK VELOCITY

BY CALCULATING
THE EXACT RATE
OF FORWARD MOMENTUM.

CHARLIE.

ENGLISH?

OH. UM...IT'S
ALL IN THE WRIST.

GOTCHA.

WHEN YOU GET
CHANGED OUTTA
YOUR SCHOOL UNIFORM,

HOP ON THE ZAMBONI.
I NEED CLEAN ICE FOR
THE AFTERNOON CROWD.

OH. NO CAN DO.
I GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE.
CHARLIE.

I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
NOT TO BRING THESE
BLASTED THINGS IN HERE.

BAD FOR BUSINESS.

BESIDES, I NEED YOU
AROUND HERE.

CAN'T ZAMBONI WITH
A BAD BACKBONE...Y.

YOU WON'T HAVE TO.
I BUILT THIS FOR YOU.

THIS IS WHAT
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.

IT'S NOT RADIOACTIVE,
IS IT? I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ANY HAIR.

GO AHEAD AND
PUT IT ON THE ICE.

IT EMITS A POSITIVE
MAGNETIC CHARGE
ALONG THE ICE,

BRIEFLY TRANSFORMING
ELECTRONS TO POSITRONS,

WHICH TEMPORARILY
RUPTURES THE COVALENT BONDS
BETWEEN MOLECULES.

ONCE THE BONDS REFORM,
THEN--
CHARLIE.

RIGHT.

ENGLISH.

UM, PUSH THAT BUTTON
RIGHT THERE,

AND SHE'LL BE SMOOTH
AS A BABY'S BUTT.

OH, ONE MORE THING.

COVER YOUR EARS.


[DEEP DESCENDING
OSCILLATIONS]

[LOUD BOOM]


OH, THAT IS
SOME TRICK.

DAD, I GOTTA GO.
I'M LATE FOR
SOME STREET HOCKEY.

I HAVE A FEELING
THAT THEY'RE FINALLY
GONNA LET ME PLAY TODAY.

SEE YA.

YEAH. SEE YA.

Charlie:
COME ON, TEAM!
LET'S GO!

GO, TEAM!

Boy: YEAH!

EXCUSE ME. MAY I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

WHAT DO YOU WANT,
CRANIUM CRUD?

WELL...I WOULD
LIKE TO PLAY.

YOU KNOW,
FOR SOMEONE SO SMART,
YOU'RE PRETTY STUPID.

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'D EVER LET YOU PLAY?

OH...I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THIS.

WE PLAY
IN THE STREET, GENIUS.
A PUCK WON'T WORK.

THIS ONE WILL.

WATCH.

HEY!
WHOA!

OH!

WOW.

HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

IT'S MADE WITH
GRAPHITE POLYMER,

ENGINEERED
TO RESIST FRICTION
ON CONCRETE.

DESIGNED IT MYSELF.

NOT BAD.

NOT BAD AT ALL.

OK, BRAINIAC.
YOU'RE IN.

COOL! OK, LET ME
JUST TAKE OFF MY SCARF.

OK.

READY!

[WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM]
GREAT.

YOU KNOW,
IT'S MY AMBITION
TO SOMEDAY DESIGN

A PUCK THAT'LL ACTUALLY
FLOAT OFF THE GROUND.

YEAH.
BUT OF COURSE,
THAT'LL REQUIRE
THE MANIPULATION

OF GRAVITONS.

GREAT. UH, WHY
DON'T YOU PLAY DEFENSE?

YOU KNOW, DR. KRICKSTEIN
IS THE REAL AUTHORITY
ON THE SUBJECT.

HE'S KINDA MY HERO.
HE AND SERGEI FEDEROV.

OH, MAN. I JUST
REALIZED SOMETHING.

IF YOU'RE ON OUR
TEAM, THAT MAKES
THE SIDES UNEVEN.

SO I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT.

HOW ABOUT YOU GO
SIT ON THE CURB AND
WE'LL WORK YOU IN?

OH...OK.

OK.

Charlie: HEY, GUYS,
DON'T HIT IT SO HARD.

REMEMBER, IT'S GRAPHITE.
EASY DOES IT.

WELL, HELLO THERE.

DR. KRICKSTEIN. PERHAPS
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.

PARTICLE WAVE CONFLICT?

SERGEI FEDEROV?

YEAH!
YEAH!

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Charlie: COME ON IN.

BROUGHT YOU
SOME BRAIN FOOD.

DON'T NEED IT.

GOT ANY COOL,
POPULAR, SOCIALLY
WELL-ADJUSTED FOOD?

SORRY. ATE ALL THAT.

SO, YOU, UH...

YOU SKIPPED DINNER

TO SPEND YOUR EVENING
IN THE ROOM FUTZING
WITH A HOCKEY STICK

AND FEELIN' SORRY
FOR YOURSELF?

NOT ENTIRELY.
TOOK A MINUTE
TO FEEL SORRY

FOR THE PEOPLE
IN WAR-TORN COUNTRIES.

WELL, DON'T LET IT
GET YOU DOWN, CHARLIE.

I'M SURE THAT
THINGS'LL LOOK UP

ONCE YOU'RE AT...
HARVARD...

PRINCETON...

MIT.

MY COLLEGE
SCHOLARSHIPS?

WORD CAME BACK?
CAL TECH.

â™ª CHARLIE'S
GOING TO COLLEGE â™ª

â™ª EVERYBODY
WANTS HIM â™ª

â™ª HEY,
CHARLIE'S GOING TO-- â™ª
CONGA LINE!

DAD...
â™ª CHARLIE'S
GOING TO COL-- â™ª

I HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHIC
MEMORY. I GOTTA LIVE

WITH THESE IMAGES
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU GENIUSES--

ALL BRAINS AND...
NO RHYTHM.

YOU KNOW, CHARLIE...

YOUR MOM AND I ARE
VERY PROUD OF YOU...

'CAUSE NOBODY
IN THIS FAMILY HAS
EVER GONE TO COLLEGE.

AND YOU...

ARE GOIN'
5 YEARS EARLY.

SO. IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO
HELP YOU DECIDE...

ALREADY DONE.

"NORTHERN UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN."

I DIDN'T KNOW YOU...
APPLIED THERE.

HUH. DIDN'T WANT
TO JINX IT.

ALL EXPENSES PAID.
I JUST HAVE TO TEACH
A FEW CLASSES.

CHARLIE.

EVERY ONE OF THESE
IS ALL EXPENSES PAID.

ALL RIGHT.
THE TRUTH IS,

THERE'S THIS GUY
AT NORTHERN.
DR. KRICKSTEIN?

KRICKSTEIN?

ISN'T THAT THE GUY
YOU'VE BEEN READIN' ABOUT?
RIGHT.

HE'S THIS CLOSE
TO DISCOVERING
THE GRAVITON.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW THE GRAVITON WORKS,

WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MANIPULATE GRAVITY...

DEFY IT.

THINK OF A WORLD

WHERE BRIDGES
WON'T COLLAPSE,

WHERE PLANES
WON'T CRASH.

A WORLD
WHERE YOUR MOTHER'S
SOUFFLÃ© WON'T FALL!

Mother:
I HEARD THAT.

HA HA.

NOW, YOU--
YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS?

I MEAN, I'VE
GOT...I'VE GOT
HARVARD HERE.

POSITIVE. THE LAB
WHERE I'LL BE WORKING--

COMPLETELY
STATE OF THE ART.

DR. KRICKSTEIN
USES THE ICE
FROM THE HOCKEY RINK

TO COOL
HIS PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

YOU SEE, THE LAB
IS DIRECTLY UNDER
THE HOCKEY RINK.

SCIENCE AND HOCKEY!
MY 2 FAVORITE THINGS
IN THE WORLD

ARE IN THE SAME BUILDING!

WHEN I FOUND THAT OUT,
I KNEW IT WAS FOR ME.

â™ª CHARLIE'S GOIN'
TO NORTHERN â™ª

â™ª CHARLIE'S GOIN'
TO NORTHERN â™ª

Both: â™ª CHARLIE'S
GOIN' TO NORTHERN â™ª

â™ª CHARLIE'S
GOIN' TO NORTHERN â™ª

IF YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS, SON...

I'M SURE, TOO.

â™ª CHARLIE'S GOIN'
TO NORTHERN â™ª

Both: â™ª CHARLIE'S
GOIN' TO NORTHERN â™ª

â™ª CHARLIE'S GOING
TO NORTHERN â™ª

â™ª HEY, CHARLIE'S
GOIN' TO NORTHERN â™ª

DAD. I USED NANOTECHNOLOGY
TO GIVE THIS STICK HERE

AN ELECTROMAGNETIC CHARGE
EVERY TIME IT TOUCHES
A PUCK...

CREATING
SUPERPOWER AND SPEED.

WAIT TILL THE GUYS
GET A LOAD OF THIS.


Man: OW!

[RAH-RAH COLLEGE THEME PLAYS]

[SHRILL WHISTLE BLOWS]

ALL RIGHT, LADDIES...
LISTEN UP!

WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOT
THIS YEAR,

BUT AS WE ALL KNOW,
THE CHAMPIONSHIP
GOES THROUGH RUMSON.

NOW, YOU NEW GUYS
NEED TO BE AWARE
THAT GOOD OL' RUMSON

AIN'T ALWAYS SO GOOD,

ESPECIALLY
WHEN THEY EXECUTE
THE RUMSON RACK.

WHAT'S THE RUMSON RACK?

OH, NOTHIN' MUCH,
REALLY.

THEY JUST CREATE
A DISTRACTION.

AND WHEN
YOU AIN'T LOOKIN'...

YOU GET ROUGHED!

UHH!

AND THEY USUALLY GO
AFTER YOUR BEST PLAYER.

WHO'S GONNA BE
READY AND WAITING.

Coach: NOW...

WE GOT
A WHOLE TRUCKLOAD

[ELECTRICAL HUM]
MORE WORK TO DO
THIS YEAR.

[ELECTRICAL HUM]

Player: WHAT THE...

[ROARING AND
ELECTRICAL HUMMING]

[PLAYERS MUTTER]

KRICKSTEIN!

[ELECTRICAL HUMMING STOPS]

MAN, I THOUGHT
THEY WERE GONNA GIVE OL'
CRICK-IN-THE-NECK THE BOOT

AND LET US HAVE
OUR ARENA BACK.

THEY WERE...

UNTIL THEY RECRUITED
SOME SUPERGENIUS KID

TO HELP HIM
SOLVE THE MYSTERIES
OF THE UNIVERSE

OR SOME SUCH GARBAGE.

MAN, WE ALMOST HAD
THE ARENA TO OURSELVES!

WHAT'S THE LITTLE
PIPWHIFFER'S NAME,
ANYWAY?

CHARLIE BOYLE!

BEEN LOOKIN'
ALL OVER FOR YOU.


I'M DEAN WALLACE.
WELCOME.

WE'RE EXPECTING
GREAT THINGS FROM THAT
BRAIN OF YOURS, SON.

HMM?

EVERYONE'S SO EXCITED
TO HAVE YOU HERE
AT NORTHERN.

WELL, NOT EVERYONE.

I THINK THEY HATE ME.

WHAT, THAT BUNCH
OF LOSERS?

WHO CARES
ABOUT THEM, HUH?

LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHIN'.

THEY LOSE
THAT BIG GAME
WITH RUMSON,

IT'S GOOD-BYE,
COACH NO-WIN-
BIG-GAME.

GKKTT!

COME ON. LET'S
GO MEET KRICKSTEIN.

GKKTT!

RAHHRRR!

OUR FACILITIES HERE
WERE BUILT IN 1954,
CHARLIE.

BEAUTIFUL,
AIN'T THEY?

YEAH.

HUH?

BEST
IN THE COUNTRY,
I THINK.

HERE WE GO.
RIGHT DOWN HERE.

IT'S KINDA CHILLY.

CHILLY? IT'S COLDER
THAN ADMIRAL BYRD'S
UNDERPANTS.

NOT MUCH
TO LOOK AT, EITHER.

I DON'T LIKE IT
DOWN HERE. ANYWAY...

I GOT SOME MAJOR,
MAJOR...STUFF TO DO.

I AM DEAN
AFTER ALL.

PROFESSOR!

GOOD.

Man: HELLO?

CHARLIE!

CHARLIE BOYLE!
I AM SO EXCITED
TO SEE YOU.

WELCOME, MY FRIEND.
COME WITH ME. GOT A LOT
TO SHOW YOU, BUDDY.

THIS...

IS THE PARTICLE...

ACCELERATOR.

HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

SHE LOOKS KINDA OLD.

WELL, IT IS
KINDA OLD.

BUT IT'S
NOT ABOUT LOOKS.

IT'S WHAT'S
UNDER THE HOOD
THAT COUNTS.

[STEAM HISSING]


SHH!

YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE.
GOT SOMETHIN' FOR YOU.

SON...IF YOU'RE SO SURE,
I'M SURE, TOO.

SO MUCH FOR HARVARD.

HERE YOU GO, CHARLIE.
GOT YOUR OWN LAB COAT.
PUT IT ON.

IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY
DOWN HERE 'CAUSE WE'RE RIGHT
UNDERNEATH THE ICE RINK,

BUT IT DOES HELP
KEEP THE ACCELERATOR
NICE AND COOL.

HOW'S THAT FEEL, HUH?

FIT GOOD? COME ON.

COME OVER HERE.
I GOT MORE TO SHOW YOU.

HERE'S
YOUR WORKSTATION.

OH. CHARLIE,
I READ YOUR PAPER

ON THE SYMMETRY
OF FRACTAL ENTROPY.

IT BLEW MY MIND!

CHARLIE, LOOK.
I KNOW YOU'RE...YOU'RE
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

THE PLACE
IS NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

IT'S JUST THAT
THE FUNDING'S NOT COMING
IN LIKE IT USED TO.

BUT I'M NOT WORRIED,
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU AND I,

WE'RE GONNA FIND
A GRAVITON, CHARLIE.
WE CAN DO IT!

TOGETHER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

YEAH...

TOGETHER.

THINGS AREN'T REALLY
SO BAD HERE, I GUESS.

AT LEAST MY ROOMMATE
TURNED OUT TO BE A NICE GUY.

YEAH, YOU MET HIM
ALREADY?

ACTUALLY, NO.
I'M GOING TO GO
MEET HIM RIGHT NOW.

I SPOKE TO HIM
ON THE PHONE THOUGH.

HE SAID THAT
THE LEFT SIDE WAS HIS.

HELP ME HERE.
AND, UH...

THE SODAS IN THE FRIDGE
WERE HIS,

AND LATER, DUDE.

AND THIS IS NICE?

HE CALLED ME DUDE.

SEE YA LATER.

SEE YOU LATER,
CHARLIE.

HI.

HELLO.

THE LAIR. COOL.

HI, GUYS.

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

WELL, I KINDA LIVE HERE.

OH, OH, OH, NO.

THERE'S NO WAY
I'M SHARING A ROOM
WITH KRICKSTEIN JR.

BUT THIS IS
MY HOUSING ASSIGNMENT.

THE LAIR JUST BECAME
THE DIAPER DEN.


HA HA.

WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT,
PINTSTEIN?

THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LONG YEAR.

I KNOW I HAVE
TO TEACH CLASSES
AS PART OF MY SCHOLARSHIP,

BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO TEACH
THIS PARTICULAR CLASS?

WELL, DUH.

YOU'RE A PHYSICS
GENIUS.

IT'S A PHYSICS LAB.

WHAT DO I GOT TO DO,
DRAW YOU A ROAD MAP,
SON, HUH?

COME ON.
AWAY YOU GO.

HELLO.

I'M CHARLIE, AND I'LL BE
TEACHING THIS CLASS.

HELLO, I'M MIKE,
AND I'LL BE DISRUPTING IT.

ALL TO MYSELF.

[PEOPLE LAUGHING]

SUPPOSEDLY, THE PARTY
STARTED IN THE QUAD,

AND THEN IT WENT
TO THE ARENA,

AND THEN IT ENDED UP
IN THE COMMON AREA

WHERE I HAD TO LISTEN
TO IT ALL NIGHT.

HA, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN.

HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
JUST JOIN THEM?

BECAUSE ALL
THE OTHER REINDEER

HATE MY BIG,
RED SHINY NOSE.

WHY DO YOU THINK?
I MEAN, THEY JUST
DON'T LIKE ME.

COME ON.
DON'T LIKE YOU?

YOU SURE?

I'VE HAD
THIS PROBLEM BEFORE.

I TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS.
IT NEVER WORKS.

WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

LIKE WHAT?

HA HA HA.

THAT'S FUNNY.

WHAT?

WELL, YOU'RE ASKING
FOR SOCIAL ADVICE

FROM A GUY THAT'S BEEN
ALONE IN THE LAB
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.

GOOD POINT.

I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER MY WORKOUT.

OK. HEY, ONE THING.

WHAT I REALLY
MEANT WAS THAT
A GOOD SCIENTIST

DOESN'T KEEP REPEATING
THE SAME EXPERIMENT
OVER AND OVER

EXPECTING TO GET
DIFFERENT RESULTS,
RIGHT?

YEAH.

YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

YEAH.
OK.

HAVE A GOOD WORKOUT.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE LAB.

ALL RIGHT.
OK, BUDDY.

BYE.

Girl: WHEW!

WHEW!

YES, YES, YES, YES.
WHEW! YES.

ALWAYS A CLASSIC
MOVE, BOB.

YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE, DICK.

IT'S A DAZZLING
PERFORMANCE BY
MISS ADDISON.

BUT IF SHE WANTS
THE GOLD, DICK...

SHE'S GOT TO NAIL
THE DOUBLE TOE LOOP.

PERFECT LANDING.

YES! YES! YES!

WHEW! YES!
YOU GO, GIRL. YES!

AAH!

I DIDN'T REALIZE
ANYONE WAS HERE.


I'M CLAIRE.

I'M CH-CH-CH...

CH...

A GOOD SCIENTIST DOESN'T
KEEP REPEATING THE SAME
EXPERIMENT OVER AND OVER

EXPECTING TO GET
DIFFERENT RESULTS.

CH-CHAZ.

CHAZ FROM CHICAGO.

CHICAGO, HUH?

THEN YOU'RE NEW
AROUND HERE.

YEAH.

SO, WHERE DO YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?

EXCUSE ME?

WHERE DO YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?

WHERE DO YOU GO?

FRANKLIN.

WELL, THERE'S
YOUR ANSWER.

COOL.

SO, I GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU AROUND.

DEFINITELY.

COOL.


Charlie: FRANKLIN JUNIOR HIGH
JUST GOT A NEW STUDENT--

CHAZ ANTHONY.

HOW DO PEOPLE
SEE IN THESE THINGS?

AMY ABRAHMS?

CLAIRE ADDISON?

HERE.

CHAZ ANTHONY?

CHAZ ANTHONY?

[DOOR OPENS]

CHAZ ANTHONY?

UH, YEAH, YEAH, YO.

I'M SO GLAD YOU
DECIDED TO JOIN US.

PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.

I SAID TAKE A SEAT,
YOUNG MAN.

I SEE FIRST IMPRESSIONS
ARE YOUR STRONG SUIT.

WELL, YOU CAN EITHER
TAKE A SEAT HERE,

OR YOU CAN TAKE
A SEAT JUST OUTSIDE
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

JUST KIDDING.

HEY, MAN, NOBODY
EVER DARED TO IRK OFF
OLD LADY SPURLOT BEFORE.

PAUL O'DONNELL.
FRIENDS CALL ME ODIE.

YOU'RE HARD CORE, MAN.

SETTLE IN, CHAZ.

I'LL BE TEACHING
THIS CLASS ALL YEAR.

AND I'LL BE
DISRUPTING IT.

AND IT TOOK
MANY, MANY YEARS

BEFORE GALILEO COULD PROVE
HIS THEORY TO BE CORRECT.

THAT, INDEED, THE PLANETS
TRAVEL AROUND THE SUN
IN A CIRCULAR ORBIT.

ELLIPTICAL.

Girl: WHAT?

WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHAZ.

WELL, I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

UH, I WAS, UH...

SKATING AND SOME GEEK
TOLD ME THAT THE ICE
RINK WAS ELLIPTICAL.

DIDN'T THINK THE INFO
COULD COME IN HANDY

WHILE I WAS STICKING
HIS TONGUE TO THE ICE.

Teacher: ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

AS YOU MAY OR MAY
NOT KNOW...

HEY, CHICAGO.

YO.

THIS IS DEION.

HEY, HOMES, YO.

ODIE SAYS
YOU'RE DOWN.

MIND IF WE
JOIN YOU?

SURE. I MEAN, YO.

[WATCH BEEPS]

OH, MAN I GOT TO GO
FINISH MY EXPERIMENT.

EXPERIMENT?

UH, YEAH, EXPERIMENT
TO SEE HOW LONG
I CAN STAY IN SCHOOL

WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY
GOING TO SCHOOL.

LATER.

FIRST DAY AND HE'S
DITCHING AT LUNCH.

HE'S THE BOMB.

HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

HEY.

I FINISHED
THE CALCULATIONS
FOR TODAY'S EXPERIMENTS.

OH, YEAH?

YEAH, THE DATA'S RIGHT
THERE ON YOUR DESK

UNDERNEATH
YOUR EIGHTH GRADE
GEOMETRY BOOK, CHAZ.

SO, HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

MY COMPUTER TOLD ME.

SO, WHO'S CHAZ?

A GUY WHO HAS A LIFE.

I'VE GONE THROUGH LIFE
SO FAR AS CHARLIE BOYLE

AND IT ISN'T
ANY SLEIGH RIDE.

TODAY, CHAZ MET
A WHOLE GROUP OF GUYS

WHO THOUGHT HE,
I WAS COOL. ME.

THAT HAS NEVER,
EVER HAPPENED TO ME
BEFORE. EVER.

AND I'M GOING BACK.

OK.

OK?

CHARLIE,
I'M NOT YOUR DAD.

YOU'RE IN COLLEGE
NOW. I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO

AS LONG AS YOU GET
YOUR WORK DONE.

GOOD.

BUT I NEED A PARTNER
WHO'S GOING TO BE
DEDICATED.

RIGHT. WHEN I'M HERE,
IT'S ALL ABOUT WORK.

GOOD.

SCIENCE. NOTHING ELSE.

GLAD TO HEAR IT.

SO THEY REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE COOL?

ONE KID EVEN GAVE ME
HIS LUNCH MONEY

'CAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO BEAT HIM UP.

LOVE TO LOVE YOU, CLAIRE,

AND I MEAN THAT.

LOVE TO LOVE YOU, CLAIRE,

AND I MEAN THAT.

YO, YO, CLAIRE, WASSUP?

[IMPERSONATING ELVIS]
I LIKE YOU, CLAIRE.

ALWAYS HAVE.

ALWAYS WILL.

[GIRL LAUGHING]

OH, LOOK, I GOT THIS ONE
FROM A STREET FIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT.

OH, AND, UH, THIS ONE
WHEN I FLIPPED MY HARLEY.

I GOT AN APPENDIX SCAR.

BEAR, BEAR...

LISTEN, IT'S NOT THE SCAR,
ALL RIGHT?

IT'S THE STORY.

GIRLS LIKE BAD BOYS, OK?

Mike: OK, GIRLS, IF YOU
THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING.

BAD BOYS, HUH?

SORRY ABOUT THAT,
PRINCIPAL KIRCH,

BUT I'M SURE
THAT TOE WILL HEAL.

[CLASS LAUGHS]

6 DETENTIONS IN 3 DAYS.

PERSONAL RECORD.

AND YOU MADE IT
TO MY CLASS WITH
5 WHOLE MINUTES LEFT.

ANOTHER PERSONAL RECORD.

WELL, THE SKELETON LECTURE
SOUNDED AWFUL INTERESTING,

SO I THOUGHT I'D VARY
MY ROUTINE A LITTLE.

Class: HA HA HA.

PARK IT,
MR. ANTHONY,

AND LOSE THE BLADES.

CATCH YOU LATER, CLAIRE.

Teacher: ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN.

DUDE, YOU'RE
SPINNING YOUR WHEELS.

CLAIRE ADDISON'S
IN THE HONOR SOCIETY.

AND CHAZ ANTHONY'S NOT.

HONOR SOCIETY GIRLS NEVER
LIKE HONOR SOCIETY GUYS.

TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

SOUNDS LIKE A RISKY
GAME PLAN TO ME.

LOOK, I'VE ANALYZED
THE SITUATION,

AND NOW I'M ENACTING
A STRATEGY

JUST LIKE ANY GOOD PSY--

PSY...CHO FOR THE HOTTEST
CHICK MADMAN WOULD DO.

COOL.

Teacher:
FOR FRAMEWORK
OF THE BODY...

NOW, A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO BRIGHTEN UP TODAY'S
BORING LECTURE.

SO, WE'VE LEARNED
THAT THE SKELETAL FRAME

IS THE STRUCTURE
UPON WHICH OUR BODIES
ARE BUILT.

OF COURSE, ALONE,
IT'S NOT MUCH GOOD.

IT REQUIRES A COMPLEX
SERIES OF MUSCLES,
TENDONS, AND NERVES

TO ACTUALLY MOVE.

AND REMEMBER,
JUST BECAUSE YOUR
SKULL IS MADE OF BONE,

THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO BE A BONEHEAD.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

I'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK.

COOL!

ALL RIGHT, NOW, LET'S
START WITH THE LEGS
AND THE FEET.

NOW, HOW MANY BONES
DO YOU THINK
ARE IN YOUR FEET?

BIG FINISH.

NOT A FAN?

NO, I AM A BIG FAN.

I JUST WISH YOU'D
USE YOUR POWERS
FOR GOOD, NOT EVIL.

WHEN EXACTLY
DID YOU GO OVER
TO THE DARK SIDE?

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

WELL, IT TOOK
A LOT OF THOUGHT
TO RIG THAT UP.

A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC
THOUGHT.

MAYBE YOU'RE A GENIUS
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW IT.

THERE ARE GENIUSES
YOUR AGE, YOU KNOW.

I WAS TALKING
TO A COLLEAGUE
OVER AT NORTHERN.

HE WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT A YOUNG MAN--

OH, SOME GEEK
IN SCIENCE CLUB
HELPED ME RIG IT UP.

[BELL RINGS]

WHO WAS IT
THAT HELPED YOU?

LIKE I SAID, SOME LOSER
IN SCIENCE CLUB.

IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

AND I'LL WAGER YOU
HIS FUTURE DOESN'T
INCLUDE THE WORDS...

DO YOU WANT FRIES
WITH THAT, SIR?

NOW, WHO WANTS
TO COME UP HERE

AND FINISH CHARTING
THESE POINTS ON THE
POLAR GRAPH FOR ME?

LET'S SEE IT.

[CLASS LAUGHS]

OOH, BITTER IRONY.

SAVAGELY LAMPOONED
ON MY OWN CHALKBOARD

WITH A CRUDE
CARICATURE

ESSAYED BY THAT
JAPESOME WAG
MIKE MacGREGOR.

YOU KNOW...

I USED TO THINK THAT
YOU WERE COOL. JERK.

All: OOH!

OOH, LOOK AT ME,
I'M JAPESOME.

Charlie: HELLO.

HEY, CHARLIE,
PROGRESS REPORT.

OH, HEY, DAD.

WELL, THE GRAPH TIME
CONTINUES TO ELUDE
MY GRASP,

I CAN'T GET
TO SQUARE ONE WITH
THIS GIRL I LIKE,

AND MY STUDENTS
HAVE BECOME
OPENLY HOSTILE.

NOT TO MENTION
THE DORM FOOD.

THAT BAD, HUH?

WELL, THE ONLY FATHERLY
ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU
ABOUT THE SCIENCE STUFF

IS JUST KEEP
PLUGGING AWAY.

NOW, AS FAR AS GIRLS
ARE CONCERNED,

I KNOW LESS ABOUT THAT
THAN SCIENCE.

BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

IF THOSE ROTTEN STUDENTS
WERE BUGGING ME,

I'D FLUNK THE LITTLE WEENIES,
OR MAKE THEM GET A TUTOR.

A TUTOR!
DAD, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

[DIAL TONE]

GENIUS?

GUESS IT DOES
RUN IN THE FAMILY.

YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO GUESS

WHAT I'VE GOT
RIGHT HERE.

OK, I'M GUESSING
STEVEN HAWKING'S AUTOGRAPH.

NOT EVEN CLOSE.

OK, OH, EVIDENCE
FOR GRAVITON?

MY FIRST F.

YOUR FIRST F.

YOUR FIRST F?

I GOT TO HANG THIS UP
SOMEWHERE.

DO WE HAVE
A REFRIGERATOR IN HERE?

WHAT AM I SAYING?
THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS A REFRIGERATOR.

UH, CHARLIE, I KNOW
I'M A LITTLE OUT OF
THE LOOP ON THIS THING,

BUT WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY
ABOUT GETTING YOUR FIRST F?

I GOTTA GO.

YO, DUDE,
THERE SHE IS.

HEY.

HI.

SO, UH, I GUESS
THEY'RE GONNA
KICK ME OUT OF SCHOOL

IF I DON'T GET
BETTER GRADES.

AND I WOULD CARE
BECAUSE...

BECAUSE I NEED A TUTOR
AND, UH...

YOU'RE PRETTY OK.

CAN'T YOU FIND
ANYONE ELSE?

NO. I MEAN, WELL,
YOU WERE THE FIRST
ONE ON MY LIST.

MAYBE WE COULD
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

I COULD TUTOR YOU
IN A FEW THINGS.

I'M NOT INTERESTED.

THEN I GUESS I SHOULD
START PRACTICING.

YOU WANT FRIES
WITH THAT, SIR?

YOU WANT FRIES
WITH THAT, SIR?

MY SCHEDULE'S VERY BUSY.

I ONLY HAVE TIME
AFTER SCHOOL AND, UH,
BEFORE PRACTICE.

OH, GREAT.
JUST WHAT I WANT
TO DO AFTER SCHOOL,

MORE SCHOOL.

TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

TAKE IT.
FINE.

FINE.

â™ª I'VE HEARD TIME
AND TIME AGAIN â™ª

â™ª HOW ALL THINGS
FALL APART â™ª

â™ª HOW NOTHING
LASTS FOREVER â™ª

â™ª WELL, THEY'RE WRONG â™ª

â™ª OH â™ª

â™ª YEAH â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE THROUGH
THE THICK AND THIN â™ª

â™ª AND THE NIGHTS
THAT SEEM SO LONG â™ª

â™ª YOU WERE THERE
WITHOUT A WORRY â™ª

â™ª YOU STOOD STRONG â™ª

â™ª OH â™ª

â™ª YOU'VE GOT
THE KEY TO MY HEART â™ª

â™ª RIGHT HERE IN MY ARMS â™ª

â™ª I'LL KEEP YOU
SAFE AND WARM â™ª

â™ª AND YOU NEVER
HAVE TO WORRY â™ª

â™ª NEVER WANT FOR NOTHING â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE I â™ª

â™ª I'M THE PRINCE
YOU'VE CHARMED â™ª

â™ª IT SEEMS SO LONG AGO â™ª

â™ª WHEN MY WORLD
WAS UPSIDE-DOWN â™ª

COME IN.

HEY, NICE...CRIB.

THANKS.

I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

ME?

THE NEW BACKSTREET BOYS.

YEAH, YOU KNOW,
JUST TO SAY THANKS AND ALL.

THAT'S GOOD, ISN'T THAT?

I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LISTENING TO, RIGHT?

I MEAN, DO YOU LIKE IT?

YES!

THANK YOU.

HEY, SO, WHAT'S WITH
THE MUSEUM?

OH, IT'S MY DAD'S.

HE'S THE HOCKEY COACH
OVER AT NORTHERN.

DO YOU WANT TO MEET HIM?

HEY, DADDY!
NO, I MEAN--

WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

I WANT YOU TO MEET...

JASON...

OF FRIDAY THE 13th...

PART 12,
THE COACH'S NIGHTMARE.

Claire: CHAZ?

I'M JUST GOING TO GET
MY THINGS HERE.

CHAZ?
NICE MEETING
ALL OF YOU.

OK.

I DON'T KNOW, CHARLIE.

I CAN'T SAY I APPROVE.

ALTHOUGH, I WOULD HAVE
LOVED TO HAVE SEEN
COACH ADDISON'S FACE.

I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T SEE MINE.

I HAD TO SMOOTH THINGS
OVER WITH CLAIRE, TOO.

THAT WAS 20 MILES
OF ROUGH ROAD
ON THE APOLOGY TURNPIKE.

HEY, DOC?

HMM?

YOU EVER HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

YEAH, SURE.
YOU KNOW, WHEN
I WAS YOUR AGE,

FOR MY SCIENCE
FAIR PROJECT,

I BUILT A ROBOT
CALLED CHERYL,

AND WE BECAME
VERY CLOSE.

I HOPE YOU'RE KIDDING.

MAYBE.

LOOK AT THIS.

NOTHING AGAIN.

I DON'T GET IT,
CHARLIE.

WE HAVE TRIED
EVERY PERMUTATION
IN THE BOOK

AND STILL,
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF A GRAVITON.

WELL, MAYBE IF WE TAKE
OUR MINDS OFF IT,

IT'LL JUST COME TO US.

YOU KNOW, IF WE
SIT BACK, RELAX,

AND, UH,
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

ARCHIMEDES.

THE EUREKA SYNDROME,
YEAH.

YOU KNOW,
EDISON REALLY
BELIEVED IN THAT.

WHENEVER HE HAD
A PROBLEM THAT HE
COULDN'T SOLVE,

HE WOULD JUST DO
ANOTHER ACTIVITY,

AND THEN BOOM,
THE ANSWER WOULD
COME TO HIM.

EUREKA!

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

COME ON,
DANCE WITH ME.

OH, NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

COME ON. WHAT DO
YOU GOT TO LOSE?

UH, YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

[ALARM BUZZES]

THE ALARM!

DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE'VE
ISOLATED THE GRAVITON?

IMPOSSIBLE, CHARLIE.

IT'S THE SAME EXPERIMENT
WE JUST RAN.
NOTHING'S ANY DIFFERENT.

EXCEPT FOR THE MUSIC.

WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT
A GRAVITON

ONLY AS A PARTICLE
UP UNTIL NOW.

WE CAN JUST AS EASILY
THINK OF IT AS A WAVE.

YOU SAID SO IN YOUR BOOK.

MICROWAVE CONFLICT.
HOW COULD I MISS THIS?

OK, OK, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN? UM...

THE MUSIC. SOUND WAVES
FROM THE MUSIC

SET UP
A PHASED HARMONIC,

AFFECTED
THE NUCLEAR MATRIX,

AND RELEASED
THE GRAVITON!

IN OTHER WORDS,
GROOVY LITTLE HOUSE BEAT

JUST UNLOCKED THE MYSTERIES
OF THE UNIVERSE!

WE DID IT, CHARLIE!

THIS IS BIG!
WE FOUND THE GRAVITON.

WE FOUND THE GRAVITON!

OH, MAN!

THIS IS VERY BIG.

NOW YOU GOT IT, DOC,
JUST LIKE THAT PARTICLE.

OK, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

WE CAN DO IT,
CHARLIE.

WE CAN CHANGE
THE WORLD.

CAN WE DO IT LATER THOUGH?
I'M KIND OF LATE
FOR SCIENCE CLASS.

YEAH, SURE. GO ON.
I'M FINE.

Boy:
TOLD YOU I STUDIED.

A "C". MAYBE I AM
A GENIUS AFTER ALL.

MAYBE YOU JUST HAD
A GOOD TUTOR.

WELL, CHAZ, YOU MAY NOT
BE A GENIUS,

BUT YOU ARE GOING
TO MEET ONE.

AFTER THE SKELETON
INCIDENT,

I GOT TO THINKING
IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU
TO MEET A KID YOUR AGE

WHO'S NOT ASHAMED
OF BEING SMART.

GOOD. HE CAN PROBABLY USE
SOME ONE-ON-ONE

WITH A KID WHO'S NOT
ASHAMED TO KICK HIS BUTT.

Class: HA HA HA.

YES, WELL, NOT JUST YOU,
THE ENTIRE CLASS.

I'VE ARRANGED A FIELD
TRIP TODAY TO NORTHERN.

I SPOKE TO DEAN WALLACE
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,

AND HE'S INVITED US OVER
TO MEET THE YOUNG MAN.

[BELL RINGS]
SO LET'S GO,
EVERYONE.

UH, I'M GOING
TO MEET YOU THERE.

TRACK TRIALS NEXT WEEK.

UH, OUT OF SHAPE.
GOTTA PRACTICE.

DOC! DOC!

CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
COME HERE.

I GOT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING REALLY COOL.

DOC, LISTEN TO ME!

CAREFUL. YOU GET
THAT STUFF ON YOU,

IT'S GOING
TO TURN YOUR SKIN
6 SHADES OF PURPLE.

DOC, MY EIGHTH GRADE
SCIENCE CLASS
IS COMING HERE RIGHT NOW

TO SEE CHARLIE BOYLE.

OH.

OH, WHAT?

WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY THE DEAN WAS TRYING
TO FIND YOU ALL MORNING.

OH, THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

WELL, YOU CAN'T BE
IN 2 PLACES AT ONCE.

VIOLATES ALL THE LAWS
OF PHYSICS.

SO...

WAIT.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

6 SHADES OF PURPLE?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU AND WELCOME.

WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO COUNT
AMONG OUR RANKS TODAY

THE YOUNGEST
PARTICLE PHYSICIST

TO EVERY GRACE THE PAGES
OF SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,

MR. CHARLIE BOYLE.

BUT BEFORE I BRING
MR. BOYLE OUT,

I HAVE SOME STARTLING NEWS.

A TERRIBLE LAB ACCIDENT
HAS LEFT YOUNG MR. BOYLE

TEMPORARILY DISFIGURED.

BUT LUCKY SCIENTIST
THAT HE IS,

HE HAS AGREED TO COME OUT
AND TALK TO YOU ANYWAY,

IF ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME.

SO PLEASE MAKE HIM
FEEL AT HOME HERE.

A NICE ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
MR. CHARLIE BOYLE. CHARLIE?

[AUDIENCE GASPS]


Charlie,
in gravely voice:
THANK YOU, FELLOW TEENS.

PLEASE DO NOT LET
MY GRUESOME APPEARANCE
FRIGHTEN YOU.

I ASSURE YOU
THAT MY AWFUL PAIN

WILL EVENTUALLY SUBSIDE.

SINCE I AM IN
OBVIOUS DISCOMFORT,

I WILL NOW TAKE
MY LEAVE AND LET
PROFESSOR KRICKSTEIN

TALK TO YOU ABOUT
ELECTRONS AND STUFF.

WELL, UH...

PSST!
ELECTRONS...
OK, UH...

Charlie: PSST!

JUST EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND,
I THINK I HAVE A CALL.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
JUST TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES.

[INAUDIBLE CHATTER]

WHAT?

HOW DO I GET THE PURPLE
STUFF OFF MY FACE?

IT'S STARTING TO BURN.

JUST USE SOAP AND WATER.

RIGHT! I'LL HIT THE BATHROOM
AND YOU GO OUT THERE AND...

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

W-W-W-WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

I DON'T KNOW. MAKE IT UP.

OFF.

MANY TIMES I THINK THAT
AN ATOM IS--IS PRETTY
MUCH LIKE THE UNIVERSE--

I GOTTA GO PAY
THE WATER BILL.
EXCUSE ME.

Krickstein:
THE NUCLEUS AND THE, UH,
ORBITING ELECTRONS...

CHAZ?

THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE
CLUE AS THYMINE IS CHANGED
TO URACIL.

UH, HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY,
WE HAVE, UH, T-1 LINES, BUT--

Man: CHAZ ANTHONY?

I'M SHOCKED
YOU EVEN SHOWED.
BUT GLAD.

YOU'RE THE MAIN ONE
I WANTED TO MEET
CHARLIE BOYLE.

Krickstein: ACTUALLY,
MY TIE WAS A GIFT

FROM THE HEAD
OF THE ANTHROPOLOGY--

EXCUSE ME, UH,
DR. KRICKSTEIN, UH,

PERHAPS IF CHARLIE
ISN'T WELL, I SHOULD
PHONE DEAN WALLACE

AND SCHEDULE ANOTHER
FIELD TRIP.

NO, NO, THERE'S
REALLY NO NEED

TO INVOLVE DEAN WALLACE
IN THIS.

I'M SURE I CAN CONVINCE
CHARLIE TO COME BACK.

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO ME?

YOU SEE, HE'S GETTING
HIS, UH, NOURISHMENT

AND HE HAS TO DO THAT.

A PREMASTICATED GRUEL

HAS TO BE FORCE FED
INTO WHAT NOW PASSES

FOR HIS ESOPHAGUS.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

IT APPEARS THAT, UH, CHARLIE
IS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE,

SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

WHAT?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I-IT'S TOO MUCH.

YES!

WHY'D YOU TELL THEM
I'D GO BACK OUT THERE?

BECAUSE THAT TEACHER
WAS GONNA TELL
THE DEAN TO RESCHEDULE.

WE DON'T WANT TO DO
THIS AGAIN. LET'S
JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

OK. OK. GIVE ME A PUSH.

AAH!



OH, MY GOSH.

YOU GUYS, SOMEBODY
SHOULD HELP HIM.

HERE, LET ME--
NO, NO, NO!

[IN GRAVELLY VOICE]
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

HE'S FINE,
HE'S FINE.

REALLY.

OK, THAT'S
IT FOR TODAY.

IN LIGHT OF TODAY'S
CIRCUMSTANCES,

THAT'S--THAT'S IT
FOR MR. BOYLE.

YOU KIDS DO YOUR
HOMEWORK. BYE.

HEY.

HEY.

I DECIDED TO MOVE
MY STUFF BACK IN.

I NEED SOME HELP.

YOU...NEED HELP?

WITH WHAT?

WELL, YOU NAME IT.

PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY,
POLI SCI.

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

I COULD SAY
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

ME? HA!

LOOK AT YOU, MIKE,
YOU'VE GOT LOOKS,

CHARM, CONFIDENCE,

WOMEN, POISE...

WOMEN.

AND LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING KICKED OFF
THE HOCKEY TEAM,

LOSING MY SCHOLARSHIP,

AND GETTING A JOB
AS A FORKLIFT OPERATOR

IN A CHEESE FACTORY.

NOT A BAD TRADE-OFF.

[MIKE LAUGHS]

YEAH, RIGHT.

LOOK, I WANT MORE
THAN THAT OUT
OF LIFE, CHARLIE.

I--I WANT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'VE GOT...

AND I DON'T.

WHAT'S THAT?

A FUTURE.

SO YOU WANT ME TO TUTOR YOU?

YEAH, AND IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO
IN RETURN...

WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING...

OK, MORE OF A SOMEONE REALLY.

WHAT'S HER NAME?

CLAIRE.

I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE MY MOVE.

I MEAN, I'VE DONE A GREAT
DEAL OF EXPLORATORY
RESEARCH, AND...

ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
S-SHUT UP. LISTEN TO ME.

TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU GATHERED,

EVERYTHING
YOU'VE LEARNED--

YEAH?

AND FORGET IT.

WHAT?!

RESEARCH IS NO GOOD
WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS.

YOU THINK TOO MUCH
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

YOU JUST GOT TO RELAX
AND...

DO WHAT COMES NATURAL.

DO...WHAT--

DON'T THINK, JUST DO.

DON'T THINK, JUST DO.

RIGHT.

LET'S HIT THE BOOKS.

YEAH!

YEAH!

YOU'RE RIGHT.
GOOD PLAY.

GOIN' FOR
THE HAT TRICK.

I'M PRAYIN'
FOR THAT, TOO.

Boy: GO LOW ON
THE PASS.

HEY, CHAZ,
WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M WINDED.

SPELLMAN.

YEAH!

HEY, SO, DO YOU WANT
TO CATCH A RIDE WITH ME
AND DAD

TO THE NORTHERN GAME
TOMORROW?

UH...YOU
AND YOUR DAD?

UH, NO, I CAN'T.
IN FACT, I CAN'T
GO AT ALL.

WHY NOT?

THIS IS THE YEAR
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA
KICK SOME RUMSON TAIL.

YEAH.
I'M SORRY I...

HAVE TO WATCH
MY SISTER.

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE AN ONLY CHILD.

I AM.

SISTER MARY CATHERINE.
SHE'S A NUN...

AND AN INVALID.

SEE YOU MONDAY,
THEN.

LATER.

LATER...DUDE.

YO.

ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

I LOVE THE SNOW.

YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

"ALL RIGHT?"

WELL, AT LEAST HERE
IT STAYS WHITE.

BACK IN CHICAGO,
IT ALWAYS ENDS UP DIRTY.

LIKE THE MEAN STREETS,
YOU KNOW?

YOU'RE NOT SO TOUGH.

[IMITATES ROBERT DI NERO]
YA TALKIN' TO ME?

ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?


YEAH?

I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
FOR THAT LITTLE BOY.

YOU WEREN'T TIRED.

I JUST NEEDED
A BREAK, THAT'S ALL.

THIS IS IT.

OK, GIVE IT A SEC.

LET HER WONDER.

GREAT MYSTERY.

3 MORE SECONDS.

TURN AND...

UHH...

DON'T THINK, JUST DO.

SO, UH...

WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO SKATE LIKE THAT?

YOUR DAD?

NO, I LEARNED HOW TO SKATE
LIKE THIS FROM MY DAD.

UNH!

THIS I LEARNED FROM MY MOM.

SHE WAS A FIGURE SKATER.

THAT'S HOW SHE AND DAD MET.

WHEN I WAS LITTLE...

I WAS KIND OF A TOMBOY.

I WANTED TO BE A GOALIE
LIKE DAD.

THEN ONE WINTER, MOM TOOK
ME TO LAKE CHENOWITH

TO SEE HER COMPETE

IN THEIR ANNUAL OUTDOOR
FIGURE SKATING COMPETITION.

SHE WAS GOOD AND ALL,

BUT NOTHING EARTH-SHATTERING.

AND THEN...RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF HER ROUTINE,

THE HEAVENS OPENED UP

AND SNOW STARTED TO FALL.

AND HER WHOLE
ATTITUDE CHANGED.

SUDDENLY, SHE WAS NO LONGER
JUST--JUST A SKATER

DOING COMPULSORY MOVES
FOR THE JUDGES.

SHE WAS A BALLERINA...

IN A SNOW GLOBE.

HMPH! THE NEXT DAY,

I TRADED IN MY GOALIE MASK
FOR A SEQUIN SKIRT.

SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING I HAD EVER SEEN.

YOU'RE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

[GIRLS GIGGLING]

OK, KID, I'M OFF TO THE
CONFERENCE IN MILWAUKEE.

I-I'LL BE BACK...

COUPLE OF DAYS.

HEY! WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
UPSTAIRS AND WATCH THE GAME?

'CAUSE HALF THE PEOPLE
UP THERE THINK
I'M A GENIUS,

AND THEN THE OTHER HALF
THINK I'M A PUNK.

SUIT YOURSELF.

HEY, I'M GOING TO USE
THE PARTICLE ACCELERATOR
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

MIGHT AS WELL
GET SOME WORK IN,

AS LONG AS
I'M STUCK DOWN HERE.

MI PARTICLE ACCELERATOR
ES SU PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

JUST DO ME A FAVOR
AND BE REAL CAREFUL, OK?

IT'S THE ONLY ONE WE GOT.

SEE YA.

Announcer: WELCOME
TO NORTHERN LIGHTS HOCKEY.

Mike: WHOA!

IGLOO CITY.

MIKE.

YEAH, IT'S
A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

THE ICE FROM THE RINK
COOLS IT.

LISTEN, I GOT MY
MIDTERM REPORT CARD BACK,

AND I WANTED TO SAY
THANKS FOR PASSING ME.

HEY, YOU HAVE NOBODY
TO THANK BUT YOURSELF.

SURE, I DO.

SO, UH...HERE.

IT'S FROM ME AND THE GUYS.

THANKS.

HEY, GOOD LUCK TODAY.

WELL, WE'RE AT THE TOP
OF OUR GAME,

SO RUMSON'S GOIN' DOWN.

UNLESS THEY CHEAT.

WHAT IF THEY COME
AFTER YOU WITH THAT
RUMSON RACK

THE COACH IS ALWAYS
GOING ON ABOUT?

WELL, THE GUYS'LL JUST
HAVE TO WATCH MY BACK.

I DON'T KNOW OF ANY WAY
TO DEFEND AGAINST IT.

I MIGHT.

[CROWD BOOS]

Man: GO HOME!

Announcer: NORTHERN
UNIVERSITY WELCOMES YOU

TO THE CONFERENCE
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME,

BETWEEN YOUR NORTHERN LIGHTS
AND THE RUMSON RAIDERS.

[CROWD BOOING]

SOUNDS LIKE THE NORTHERN
FANS ARE GONNA DROWN OUT
THE RUMSON FANS.

DUDE, THOSE
ARE THE RUMSON FANS.

IT TURNS OUT
THEY ONLY RESPOND TO
NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT.

I HEAR THEY RECRUIT
EXCLUSIVELY
FROM BROKEN HOMES.

Boy: COME ON, DUDE.

ALL RIGHT, NOW THE 3 TO
WORRY ABOUT ARE STOKER,

RYDER, AND CROSS.

NOW CROSS WILL USUALLY
DISTRACT THE REFEREE
HERE,

WHILE STOKER AND RYDER
RACK OUR BEST PLAYER,

WHICH IS ME.

YEAH, SO HOW DO WE STOP IT?

WELL, WE DON'T.

WE SEND SOMEBODY ELSE
OUT THERE WITH
MY NUMBER,

AND WE LET HIM GET
RACKED.

THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

WE'LL STILL LOSE
A PLAYER
IN THE PROCESS.

NOT NECESSARILY.

WE COULD JUST LOSE
AN EQUIPMENT MANAGER.

BUT--BUT--

AND YOU'D COME OUT
WITH A PHONY NUMBER.

I LIKE IT.
BUT--

LET'S GET OUT THERE AND
STICK IT TO THESE CHEATERS.

[YELLS OF AGREEMENT]


HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS, MIKE?

HEY, I'M A GENIUS.

HUGO, SUIT UP!

HEY.

THANKS, I OWE YOU ONE.

WE'RE EVEN.

Announcer:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

YOUR NORTHERN LIGHTS!


[ORGAN PLAYS "CHARGE"]

[MUSIC FROM HOCKEY RINK
IS HEARD]

[CROWD CHEERING]

ADDISONS, A WORD.

DEAN WALLACE,

GOOD OF YOU TO COME.

YEAH, ENOUGH
PLEASANTRIES. LISTEN,

IF WE BEAT
OUR ARCH RIVAL TONIGHT,

WHICH WOULD BE A FIRST
IN YOUR TENURE, IF I'M
NOT MISTAKEN.

WE'D GET TO TAKE HOME
SOME SORT OF GREAT BIG
CUP, WOULD WE NOT?

YES.

YEAH, I WANT THAT CUP...

SO BADLY.

SO I GUESS YOU KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE NOW, HUH?

WELL, I'M OFF
TO THE CONCESSIONS.

I GOTTA GET
MY FOAM FINGER.

DON'T WORRY, HONEY,
WE'RE GONNA WIN.

Announcer: AND NOW,
THE CHAMPIONSHIP FACE-OFF.

NORTHERN CONTROLS THE PUCK.

YEAH!

[HORN BLASTS]

THAT'S IT!

I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

5 MINUTES, 5 MINUTES.
NO ONE WILL EVER SEE ME.


WHOA!

YEAH!

CHAZ?!

ODIE.

WE THOUGHT YOU
WEREN'T GONNA SHOW.

COME ON.

BY THE WAY,
COOL SHIRT, MAN.

THANKS.

CHAZ, WHAT HAPPENED
TO SISTER MARY?

SHE...

GOT UP AND WALKED.

IT-IT'S A MIRACLE.

THEY'RE THINKING
OF CANONIZING HER.

[LOUD BEEPING,
ALARM BLARING]

UNH!

RIGHT ON THE MONEY!

YEAH.

CHAZ?! YES!

THIS ISN'T GOOD.

DADDY.

YES, YES!

WHAT'S THAT,
PUDDIN'?
HE'S OVER THERE.

DADDY, THE BOY
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT,
HE'S HERE.

WHAT'S--WHAT'S THAT,
SWEETHEART?

HE'S H-HE'S HERE.

HE WAS JUST THERE
A SECOND AGO.

[CROWD BOOS]

Coach: HERE WE GO.

THEY'RE GETTING
IN POSITION FOR THE RACK.

HANG IN THERE, HUGO!

[CROWD BOOS]

WHO?S THAT?

I DON'T KNOW.

Announcer: GOALIE GARCIA
UNABLE TO INTERCEPT--

WHOO! WHOO!

WHOO!

WHOO-HOO!

IT'S THE BREAKER.

THAT WAS SO TOTALLY UNFAIR.

YEAH!

YOU OK, HUGO?

CAN ZOO-ZOO
COME OUT TO PLAY?

Announcer: THIS REMINDER.
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING--

CHARLIE, JUST IN TIME.
HOW YA DOIN', HUH?

I'M ITCHIN' TO BRING
MY GOLDEN BOY IN FRONT OF
THE LOCAL PRESS OUT THERE.

SIR, ACTUALLY--

THAT SHIRT'S A NICE TOUCH.
SHOWS YOU'RE LOYAL.

AND I'LL AWARD THE FINGER,
SON, HUH?

I DO, BUT--

CAN'T POINT THE DIRECTION
WITH A NORMAL-SIZED FINGER.

COME ON, I GOT THE BEST SEATS
IN THE HOUSE. RINKSIDE.

ACTUALLY, I'M RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN EXPERIMENT.

I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE LAB.

EXPERIMENT, HUH?

PRESS. BIG PRESS.
BIG PRESS, OK.

MAKE IT AN IMPORTANT--NO,
MAKE IT A SUPERIMPORTANT
EXPERIMENT.

COME ON, COME ON.
LET'S CATCH THE GAME.

HEY! HERE WE GO.

[BEEPING
AND ALARM BLARING]

HEY!

Wallace: UNO TO ZIPPO.

I LIKE IT.
COME ON, MOVE OVER!

UNH!


I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

DADDY, HE SOMEHOW WEASLED
HIS WAY ONTO THE BENCH.

THAT IS SO HIM.

WHO, SWEETIE?

CHAZ. THE BOY SITTING
NEXT TO DEAN WALLACE.

OH, YOU MEAN CHARLIE?

CHARLIE?
HIS NAME'S NOT CHARLIE.

THAT'S CHAZ ANTHONY.
HE'S THE BOY
I'VE BEEN TUTORING.

NO, THAT'S
CHARLIE BOYLE.

HE'S A STUDENT HERE.

THAT'S CHAZ.

HE'S BEEN TO OUR HOUSE.
HE WORE YOUR GOLDEN
GOALIE MA--

AND NOW I KNOW WHY.

HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE HIS FACE.

CLAIRE?

SO WHO'S CHARLIE BOYLE?

CLAIRE,
LET ME EXPLAIN.

EXPLAIN? THEN IT'S TRUE.

JUST WHAT WAS ALL OF THIS?
WAS IT ONE OF YOUR EXPERIMENTS?

WERE YOU MAKING A STUDY
OF THE LOCAL CULTURE?

NO, I--

THEN I GUESS YOU WERE
JUST HAVING A LAUGH
AT MY EXPENSE.

IMAGINE, ME THINKING
I COULD TEACH YOU.

WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?

'CAUSE I'M A BIG FAT LIAR.


I ALSO LEFT THE PARTICLE
ACCELERATOR ON!

GET OFF THE ICE!

GET OFF THE ICE!

GET OFF THE ICE!

GET OFF THE ICE!

GET OFF!

GET OFF THE ICE!


Chaz: GET OFF THE ICE!

Announcer:
PLEASE REMAIN CALM.

DO NOT VENTURE
ONTO THE ICE!

GET OFF THE ICE!

THAT'S IT.
THIS GAME IS POSTPONED
UNTIL WE CAN REPAIR THE ICE.

YOU DID THIS?!

2 MINUTES LEFT,
AND WE WERE THIS CLOSE.

THIS CLOSE!

WE WOULD HAVE WON
THIS GAME.

YOU MEAN,
WE'RE NOT GONNA WIN?

THIS IS BAD, COACH.

VERY BAD.

THANKS, KID.
YOU PROBABLY
JUST COST ME MY JOB.

I NEVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

Announcer:
THE GAME HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.

PLEASE CHECK
WITH THE TICKET OFFICE

FOR THE RESCHEDULED
DATE AND TIME.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

HELLO?

Charlie: CLAIRE?

CLAIRE!

CLAIRE!

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

Charlie: CLAIRE!


[TELEPHONE RINGS]

Charlie: CLAIRE--

P.A.: ALSO I WOULD LIKE
TO INFORM--


Charlie: I WOULD LIKE
TO INFORM ALL STUDENTS

THAT CHAZ ANTHONY, ALSO
KNOWN AS CHARLIE BOYLE,

WISHES TO APOLOGIZE
AT FRANKLIN.

MOSTLY I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO MY FRIENDS.

YOU'RE THE BEST ONES
I EVER HAD.

PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

THANKS.

WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE CON ARTIST

FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHAZ.

I NEVER MEANT FOR
ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN.

SO YOU JUST WANTED
TO MAKE US LOOK STUPID

FOR YOUR OWN SICK,
TWISTED PLEASURE?

BUT NOT FOR ANYTHING BAD.

Claire: COME ON, GUYS.

HEY, AND THAT
WAS PRETTY FUNNY
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT--

HEY!

WHAT ARE YOU READING?

BREAKAWAY.

I'M IMMERSING MYSELF
IN FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.

THEY CAN'T GET MAD AT YOU.

I LOVE BREAKAWAY.

OOH, IS THAT THE ONE
WHERE ZORON GOES
TO MARS,

AND SAVES QUEEN SCHLOFF
AND THE ARGOLINKS?

NO, THAT'S FEBRUARY.

THIS IS THE ONE WHERE
ZORON FINDS, UH,
SUBATOMIC PARTICLES

AND HOW THEY'RE CONNECTED
TO A MYSTERIOUS QUANTUM FORCE.

OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
THAT'S AN OLD ONE.

BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

THAT'S ACTUALLY BASED ON
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED.

IT WAS, UH, GENEVA, 1997.

SWISS SCIENTISTS WERE
ABLE TO SPLIT A PHOTON,

AND EVEN THOUGH THE PARTICLES
ARE 6 MILES APART,

WHATEVER ONE DOES,
THE OTHER ONE DOES

EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

COOL!

YOU KNOW, IF WE SPLIT
OUR GRAVITON,

WE COULD STUDY
ITS QUANTUM FORCE,

AND MAYBE UNLOCK
THE SECRET AS TO HOW
IT WORKS.

AND THEN...

Krickstein and Charlie:
DEFY GRAVITY.

LET'S GET TO WORK.

2-7, 3-7...

AND THE OUTPUT
LEVEL IS 999.

OK.

NOW THIS CHIP HAS
33 ANTIGRAVITY HALVES.

AND YOURS
HAS THE PROTOTYPES.

WHY THE RUBBER COATING?

THEY ALL ACT LIKE
SUPERBALLS.

IT'S JUST FOR PROTECTION.

AND WHEN I PRESS THIS BUTTON,

WHATEVER MINE DOES,
YOURS CAN DO THE SAME THING.

HERE WE GO.

1...2...3...



HEY, CHARLIE?

YEAH?

STOP HITTIN' YOURSELF
IN THE HEAD.

AH, CHARLIE,
ARE YOU TICKLISH?

[BOTH LAUGH]

OK!

ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH!

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?!

THE NOBEL PRIZE!

NO...IT MEANS
I CAN MAKE AMENDS

FOR ALL THE DAMAGE
I'VE DONE.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

WELL, WITH WHAT
WE JUST DISCOVERED,

I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO HELP NORTHERN
BEAT RUMSEN.

AND THEN THEY'LL WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

AND CLAIRE'S DAD
CAN KEEP HIS JOB,

AND MY FRIENDS'LL
BE HAPPY WITH ME
AGAIN,

AND MAYBE...
CLAIRE MIGHT
LIKE ME AGAIN, TOO.

A LITTLE.

MAYBE.

ALL I KNOW IS

IS THAT I'VE LET
EVERYBODY DOWN,

AND IF I GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT,

I GOTTA TAKE IT!

WELL, WAIT,
WAIT A SECOND.

FIRST OF ALL...

YOU HAVEN'T
LET ME DOWN.

YOU SAVED ME!

CHARLIE, I COULD
NEVER HAVE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOU!

YOU'RE MORE THAN
MY ASSISTANT.

YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

THANKS, DOC.

BUT I GOTTA GO.

WHY ARE YOU HERE?

I NEED HELP.

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO HELP THE TEAM TONIGHT,

KEEP RUMSEN FROM CHEATING,

GIVE OUR GUYS
A CHANCE TO WIN.

WHY...SO YOU CAN
LOOK GOOD?

NO. SO NORTHERN
CAN FINALLY BEAT RUMSEN.

SO YOUR DAD
CAN KEEP HIS JOB.

I'M DOING IT
FOR EVERYBODY.

DON'T DO US
ANY FAVORS.

WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE US ALONE...

CHAZ?

I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

MY NAME'S NOT CHAZ.

IT'S CHARLIE.

CHARLIE BOYLE.

I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

YEAH!
YEAH!

Game announcer:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

WELCOME TO NORTHERN ARENA!

THIS IS BASE OPS.

I NEED A GO/NO GO
ON OPERATION RACK RUMSEN.

SKATES IS GO, OPS.

VIDEO?

ROGER THAT.

BLADES?

I WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE KNOWN

THAT I AM HERE
UNDER EXTREME PROTEST,

AND I'M ONLY DOING THIS
SO MY FATHER
DOESN'T WIND UP

STAGE MANAGING
THE ICE CAPADES.

I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A GO, BLADES.

SKATES, RUMSEN
BUS SHOULD BE
IN TARGET RANGE...

NOW.

ROGER THAT, OPS.

OK, YOU GUYS,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

VIDEO,
MOVE INTO POSITION.

VIDEO'S IN PLACE,
OPS.

ROGER, VIDEO.

HEY, DEION.

HEY, CHARLIE.

HOW'S IT GOING?

VIDEO'S A GO.

WHERE'S BLADES?

RIGHT HERE.

YOU LOOK GREAT!

LET'S JUST HOPE
THIS WORKS.

IS IT ME,
OR DID IT JUST
GET COLDER IN HERE?

MIKE, YOU KNOW
THEY'RE COMIN' AFTER YOU.

FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,
I'M PULLIN' YOU OUT!

YOU JUST TRY
AND DO THAT!

HOUSTON, WE HAVE FACE-OFF!

Game announcer:
AND NOW, THE FACE-OFF

FOR THE RE-SCHEDULED
CENTRAL CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP

BETWEEN THE RUMSEN RAIDERS
AND YOUR NORTHERN LIGHTS!

HOW'S THIS
SUPPOSED TO WORK
AGAIN?

WE'RE GOING TO
CONTROL KEY PLAYERS
ON RUMSEN FROM HERE.

HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

I'VE IMPLANTED
MICROCHIPS IN THE SKATES
OF RYDER, STOKER, CROSS,

THE 3 MAIN PLAYERS
WHO GIVE UP
THE RUMSEN RACK.

NOW, EACH MICROCHIP
IS INFUSED WITH
TRILLIONS OF
GRAVITON HALVES,

LIKE THE SUPER BALLS
I SHOWED YOU.

CORRESPONDING
MICROCHIPS WITH OTHER
GRAVITON HALVES

WILL BE IN OUR SKATES.

WHATEVER OUR SKATES DO,
THEIR SKATES WILL BE
FORCED TO DO.

MONKEY SEE,
MONKEY DO!

EXACTLY.

ISN'T THAT...CHEATING?

WE ONLY NEED TO KEEP
RUMSEN FROM CHEATING.

OUR GUYS
CAN DO THE REST.

NOW, WHEN THE TIME
COMES, DEION WILL
FLIP THE SWITCH,

ACTIVATING
THE PARTICLES,
AND WE'RE ON.

AND I HELPED YOU
GET A "C" IN SCIENCE.

YOU SURE DID
A NUMBER
ON THIS LAB.

WON'T THAT
PROFESSOR GUY
CARE?

NAH. I'LL HAVE IT
BACK TO NORMAL
AFTER THE GAME.

BESIDES, I'VE ARRANGED
HIS SCHEDULE SO THAT
HE'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.

AND HE'S NEVER HERE
DURING HOCKEY GAMES.

WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

OK. ALMOST NEVER.

CHARLIE...THIS HAS GONE
WAY TOO FAR!

I LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
WHEN YOU ALMOST DESTROYED
THE ACCELERATOR,

BUT I CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

I TOLD YOU
I HAD TO DO WHAT
I HAD TO DO.

NO. THIS HAS GOTTA STOP,
AND IT'S GOTTA STOP
RIGHT NOW.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON MY SIDE!

YOU KNOW
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

BUT YOU'RE PUTTING
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE
IN JEOPARDY.

AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT SCIENCE FIRST.

AHEAD OF WHAT?
YOU CAN SOLVE ALL THE
MYSTERIES IN THE WORLD,

BUT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN
WITHOUT FRIENDS?
NOTHING.

THE CHANCE TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE SELFISH
THINGS I DID...

TO HELP MY FRIENDS...

THAT MEANS EVERYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

SO PLEASE...HELP ME.

I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.
I CAN'T BE A PARTY
TO THIS.

BUT WAIT!

CHAZ! I MEAN CHARLIE.

WE GOT SOME ACTION
HERE.

ODIE, TIGHT UP.

THEY'RE GOING AFTER MIKE!

OMAR, YOU'RE IN!

OK, GUYS,
GET READY.

CROSS IS LEAVING
THE BOX.

HE'S OUT OF CONTROL!

Game announcer:

COACH, YOU ARE GONNA
BE HERE A LONG TIME,
MY FRIEND.

OK. WE'LL JUST CLEAR OUT.

WHAT YOU DID.

THANKS.

HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

CONDITION.
