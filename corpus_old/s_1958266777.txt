Lieutenant Carapax,

tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

-They're cutting into it now.
-Ah. That's exciting.

I've had them working
around the clock

since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

until we're ready
to show the board.

Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

-Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
-Sorry.

Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

Well,
push your men harder.

I've searched for 15 years.

I don't want
to wait another second.

Should've called
before making the trip out,
Miss Kord.

This could be another decoy.

It's in there.

I can feel it.

All right.
Let's do this.

Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

Like you're six figures
in debt.

Okay.

We say nothing for now.

Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

I'll tell him.

What the hell? Why not?

Even good news...

And this is pretty bad news.

I can be joyful.

Your job
is the balloon.

Hope I can handle it.

Handle what?

Hey, hey, hey!

The graduate is here!

How was your flight?
Good.

-Are you hungry?
-Of course.

Here. It's all they had.

Welcome back, bro.
Thank you.

Nana!

Now we hug!

Hey,
where's Uncle Rudy?

Welcome back,
<i>pinche</i> college boy.

Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

No. No hugs, man.

They got <i>Big Brother</i> watching.
There's cameras.

I knew you were gonna
say something.

Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

Yeah,
and they're all so happy

to finally catch you.

You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

that's gonna get us all busted.

Where'd you get this?

I bought it
for Jaime.

A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

Come on. What are you doing?

Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

Good to know
some things don't change.

Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

Milagro.
What?

Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

The truth? What is it?

We...
We...

We're losing the house.

What?

See?

-He didn't take it that bad.
-No, no, no, losing the house?

What does she mean,
losing the house?

-The landlord tripled the rent.
-They gave us three months

to come up with the money
or get out.

I am so sorry, <i>flaquito.</i>

No. <i>Am</i> don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

It just means that
we're gonna have to

bust our ass
at the shop, right?

Mmm... auto shop's gone.

-How?
-You can thank Kord for that.

Brother.
We couldn't keep up.

Especially since
your dad, he...

He, uh... had a...

He...
Dad had a heart attack.

What?

I'm fine!

At least the food's the same.

Wait, why didn't you tell me?

You were working so hard,
<i>mi amor.</i>

We didn't want
to distract you from school.

Ma, I could have
done something.

I could have come back.

I could have been here.
I could have--

<i>Animo,</i> Jaime.

We figured it out.
We always do.

We have a lot
to be grateful for. <i>Mira...</i>

Yeah. And the last!

Yes, because you didn't apply.

What,
so I can get into debt

for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

What? 25%?

<i>Mi amor,</i>
these people make nothing.

We are broke.

Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

<i>Remember</i>
<i>how Mom taught us salsa</i>

<i>right there on the front porch?</i>

<i>You were always</i>
<i>better than me.</i>

<i>Yeah.
</i> <i>No, I still think</i> <i>you don't know</i>

<i>how to dance salsa.</i>

<i>Yeah, I got</i>
<i>two left feet. I can't help it.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>your 21st birthday?</i>

<i>I remember the first half.</i>

<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we're losing this place.</i>

<i>It was rough.</i>

<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I'm not leaving again.</i>

What about grad school?

Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

I can't get us
into even more debt.

<i>Animo,</i> bro.

Okay, you always land
on your feet.

You're "Jaime."

Thank you, but...

This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen,
Mili.

What was supposed to happen?

I was supposed to make it out.

I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

-You know what I meant.
-Yeah.

Doesn't it bother you

that they talk about progress
and get everything

while we have to sit here
and go broke?

You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys, <i>carnal.</i>

That progress is not for us.

Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

We used to have the other side
of the tracks

and now they want that, too.

I still have a degree, right?

That's gotta mean something.
I'll get a job.

Not just any job,
but a prime job.

Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

Yeah, just watch, Mili.

Just watch.

Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

This is bullshit.

Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

for hooking me up
with this gig."

It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

How am I supposed to
get experience

when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

Sounds like a "you" problem.

Seriously?

What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

-With the actual code
in hand...
-Hey.

-...we can move
beyond the prototype phase.
-Check it out.

Yes, yes.

There goes Victoria Kord.

Look at that walk.

She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

I don't think so.

-I'm gonna say hi.
-What? No--

Good afternoon, ma'am.

If you want, we could.

It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

Mm-hm.

We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

It's like our superpower.

Okay. Back to work.

I agree. That's a waste
of time, but General,
I am telling you

what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

is gonna blow you away.

Yes. I look forward, also.

Bye.

Aunt Vicki?

Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

I didn't know you were coming.

Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

My favorite niece, Jennifer.

So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

<i>The world has changed.</i>

<i>Kord Industries faces</i>
<i>an unprecedented challenge</i>

<i>to secure our assets,</i>
<i>both here and abroad,</i>

<i>from our promethium mines</i>
<i>in Guatemala,</i>

<i>to our real estate developments</i>
<i>right here in Palmera City.</i>

<i>Introducing the future</i>
<i>of private policing:</i>

<i>The O.M.A.C.,</i>
<i>the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

Where are we going?

Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

I...

<i>Using</i>
<i>revolutionary Kord symbiotech,</i>

<i>the O.M.A.C. connects directly</i>
<i>into the human brain,</i>

<i>to create a self-contained</i>
<i>war unit,</i>

<i>allowing a single soldier</i>
<i>to harness the power</i>
<i>of legions.</i>

<i>The O.M.A.C. ensures security</i>
<i>Kord can rely on.</i>

<i>A future we can control.</i>

<i>The O.M.A.C.</i>

Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

So, this... project
was shut down years ago.

Why have you relaunched it?

Jennifer,
the O.M.A.C.
is the future of this company.

You should be so excited.

No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

-That's classified.
-Mm.

It's a secret.

But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

is what's gonna go on
at this party.

It's gonna be
an amazing evening

with some
very interesting people,

so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

All right, see you later.

I know what
you're doing, Vicki.

We don't make weapons anymore.

Whoa, whoa, "we"?

Who's "we"?

You are nothing
to this company.
You're an expense.

A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

-doing your "charity work."
-My father would never--

Look, your father was handed
a company I built...
my company.

Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

and then after he'd
done all that,
you know what he did?

He just disappeared,

and left me
to pick up the pieces.

Your father
abandoned this company.

And he abandoned you.

I won't let you do this.

Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

Back away.

I'm not afraid of you.

Maybe you should be.

Hey, hey!

Uh, sh... she said
to back away, ma'am.

Oooh-whee!

That was lavish!

Oh, shit.

And who are you, handsome?

Jaime Reyes.

I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

-I'm...
-You, too, toilet. Go.

<i>Andale.</i>

Thanks.

Where's the car?

Uh, 47 minutes.

Hey, are you okay? That was--

I appreciate the chivalry,

but I can take care
of myself, okay?

Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

She's a Kord.
They're all dicks.

Jenny Kord.

We're not all dicks.

Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
Uh...

Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

It's fine.

Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

Okay. Yeah.

Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

Okay.

I might be able to get you
a job somewhere else
in our company.

Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

I'll do anything. Really.

Anything, huh?

Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

-Pre-law.
-I... Yeah.

You guys need any pre-lawyers?

Okay.

-Text me.
-Okay.

Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

Nice to meet you, too...

Jenny Kord.

I think she might be into you.

What? No.

Bye.

-You think?
-Yeah. Yeah.

She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

Hey, you know what?

Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

-like <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>
-Okay.

Except, she's
the rich white dude

and you're the Maria!

Yeah. Okay.

You drinking?

-Just one.
-Okay.

Don't tell your mother.

Can't sleep?

No.

Yeah.

I planted those <i>nopales</i> with
<i>la</i> Nana,

when you were a baby.

Look at them now.

Like you and <i>la</i> Mili,
grown and beautiful.

You okay?

Yeah.

Sorry, <i>Apa,</i> it's just
everything right now

feels so out of reach, and...

I feel like I failed you guys.

We're on a journey, Jaime...

This house, the <i>nopales,</i>
<i>el</i> auto shop.

Everything.

They're just a stop
in the journey.

But this isn't the destination.

And what is it?

I don't know.

What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

Things don't last.

<i>La familia,</i> that's forever.

That lasts.

Everyone has a purpose.

You just haven't found yours.

So what's your purpose then?

I'm still searching, too.

But right now, it's this.

Talking to you, right here.

Okay.

All right, okay, Jaime.
You got this.

God...

Thank you, <i>Apa.</i>

<i>Ya, pues,</i> you guys
can go, okay?

You're gonna be okay, <i>flaquito.</i>
You belong here.

Yeah, <i>cabezon.</i>
You look like an asshole

just like everybody else here.

Okay.

-Bring your A-game, bro.
-Yeah.

Bring a Molotov cocktail
to burn this dump down!

Okay!

Hey, and get me a job, too!

Jaime, Jaime, Jaime...

They don't get out much.

<i>Hello, I'm Victoria Kord,</i>

<i>and this is Kord Industries,</i>

<i>a company with the planet</i>
<i>in its sight</i>

<i>and the future on its mind.</i>

<i>We are taking our</i>
<i>cutting edge technology...</i>

Hi, nice to meet you.

Deliveries are downstairs.

Uh... No, no, no.
My name is Jaime.

Jaime Reyes.
I'm here to see Jenny Kord.

Do you have
an appointment, Jamie?

-Um... It's Jaime, but--
-Sorry?

Uh...
Yes, I do have an appointment.

She said to drop by,
so I'm sure I should--

-Oh, you can stand there.
-Okay.

Why don't you
have a seat, Jamie?

Okay. Thank you.

She found it.

Jenny?

Uh... Okay...

Okay.

Just me and you.

No.

No.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

No!

No, no, no, no, no!

There's been a security breach.
Lock the building.

Lock the building!

Jenny! Jenny.

What?

Hey!
Oh!

Jenny!

Oh-- Sorry.

Hey, Jenny Kord!
It's me. Jaime from yesterday.

-I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
-No, that's all good.

But you know, yesterday
you said you'd consider
getting me a job

and, you know,
I can't leave without one

even if that sounds too--

Do you think you could pause
for one second? Please--

Look, Jaime,
this is really a bad time.

Okay. Let's... let's talk
while you have lunch.

Please...

Stay on comms.

You said you'd
do anything, right?

Yeah. Basically, anything.

Here.

-Guard that with your life.
-Okay.

But do not open it.

Do not touch it!
Don't even look at it!

Okay. I'm just gonna
guard it with my life.

Yeah, you're a quick learner.

-Yeah.
-Good. Now go!

-Okay. Okay!
-Go, go, go!

Lock up the south entrances!
You two, with me!

So, you went in
to get us jobs,

and all you brought back
was a hamburger?

Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

You haven't looked?

She said not to open it. I--

Oh--

She's not here.
What?

Okay, okay. One look.

Oh, you guys are so childish.

What the hell is that?

Huh.

Why was she hiding it?

I don't know.

Hm.
It's kind of a letdown.

The world's biggest tick.

Okay. You guys are the ones
who wanted to see it.

Hey, hey, hey!

Milagro. Okay, look.
Very mature, but she said
to not open it, so please--

Mmm, she said for you
to not open it, bro.

Stop, stop. Hey, <i>oye.</i>

It's heavy.
Okay, okay.

I'm gonna use a motor,
all right?

-I'm gonna get my drill.
-Wait, wait!

Don't get the drill!
What are you doing?

God, I hate when you do that.

Whoa.

Ooh. Is that
the new Tamagotchi?

How did you
get it to do that?

I don't know.

<i>Ama.</i>

I think it likes me.

What the hell!

It doesn't like me!

Jaime, it's on your face!
It's on your face!

Get it off!

Alberto!

<i>Cabezon!</i>

What the hell?

Where did it go?
Where did it go?

Oh, man! I'm trying
to help you, <i>cabezon!</i>

I think it's inside of me.

Oh, my God! It's inside of me!

Inside you? How?

He's possessed!

Oh, my God.

Jaime!

Milagro!

Jaime! Jaime! Jaime!

Rudy, what's going on?

-He's moving. He's moving.
-Jaime?

No, no, no! No!

Damn! Shit.

That scared
the <i>frijoles</i> outta me.

Are you okay, <i>mijo?</i>

<i>Cabezon.</i>
Jaime.

<i>Flaquito.</i>

What the f--

<i>Host acquired.</i>

Who said that?

<i>System</i>
<i>configuration initializing.</i>

Wait.
You don't hear that?

Don't look at him in the eyes.

<i>Analyzing host.</i>

<i>-Flaco?</i>
<i>-Mijo?</i>

There's a voice in my head.

<i>Hello, Jaime.</i>
What is happening?

<i>Begin systems check in three...</i>

Systems check?

<i>...two, one.</i>

<i>Thrusters engaged.</i>

It's okay. It's gonna be okay!

What are you doing?
What's happening?

<i>Escape velocity</i>
<i>protocol engaged.</i>

Where are you taking me?

<i>Crossing atmospheric layers.</i>

Stop!

<i>Adjusting pressure</i>
<i>for host protection.</i>

<i>Ay, virgencita,</i> I'm in space.
I'm in space.

Oh, man, I'm in space.

What the hell is going on?

Wait, is that my house?

<i>Testing re-entry systems.</i>

Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

No, no, no, no!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I'm on fire!

Stop, stop, stop! Oh, God!

Fly, fly!

No. No, no, no.

<i>Approaching contact.</i>

Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

<i>Three hundred meters.</i>

<i>Two hundred meters.</i>

<i>One hundred meters.</i>

<i>Braking systems check complete.</i>

Oh, thank God it's over.

Okay, you can take me home now.

<i>Flight systems engaged.</i>

Wait, wait, wait...
Don't engage!

Stop, stop, stop!

Listen to me!

You've got the wrong guy!

I swear! I'm a nobody!

Oh, come on!

<i>Testing acceleration systems.</i>

Too fast! Too fast!

Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

What was that?

I don't know what I'm doing!

Sorry about that.

<i>Fine-tuning flight control.</i>

Watch out. Watch out!

Pull up! Pull up!

Why are you doing this to me?

<i>Host overreacting.</i>

Overreacting? You kidnapped me!

20 minutes, I think.

-Man, has it hit you yet?
-No.

-'Cause it ain't hit me.
-No.

-Man, has it hit you?
-Nah, man.

My back!

<i>Landing systems check complete.</i>

What was that?

Are you guys okay?
 -What did you do to my car, man?

Hey, hey,
do you have insurance, man?

Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

<i>Threat approaching.</i>

What the hell?

Oh, no, what did you do?

<i>Host protection successful.</i>

Hey, hey, look,
is anyone hurt?

Oh, no. Calm down.
I can explain.

There's nothing to worry about.

Oh, my God, there's a kid!
It wasn't me, I swear.

This is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm not in control--

<i>Systems check complete.</i>

Oh, no, not again.

I think it just hit me.

Let me explain that again.

He's technically
not a missing person,

but he is missing.

-But also, he is...
-Possessed!

He exploded out of the roof.
With rockets on his back.

Shouldn't we be
out there looking for him?

No, no, no!

I'm on hold again.

<i>Return landing successful.</i>

Never mind. We found him.

Jaime?

Yo, put those
<i>huevos</i> away, bro.

It's Jamie, not Jaime.

Oh, no.

What are you guys doing?

He's alive.

Jaime. Do you feel okay, <i>mijo?</i>

Oh!

No. No way.

Jaime, listen,

-there's something on--
-No, not now, Milagro.

-Jaime, I'm serious.
-No, no, no. Not now, Milagro.

-Not now!
-There's something on your--

Hey, Jaime,
keep that blanket

now that it touched
your <i>chorizo.</i>

What is going on?

You can't fly.

You can't fly.
Superman can fly.

Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

Yeah, right. Okay.

I tried telling him.

Okay, guys. I... I need
to go find Jenny Kord,

'cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

Uh, where are my shoes?

Come on, where are my... shoes.

Not the 84s!

These were my favorite shoes.

Okay, okay.

Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

<i>Ama,</i> I don't know.

I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

-Cut what?
-...and flew into orbit.

Flew into orbit?
<i>- Apa,</i> I don't know.

-That's why I need Jenny. Okay?
-I am calling the police.

No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.
They work for Kord.

What do you think
Kord's gonna do

when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

has that type of military tech
inside of him?

They're gonna lock his ass up.

And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

so that we don't tell anybody.

And it's not like
the government isn't

used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

-This is Area 51!
-Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

are gonna be all over this,

and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

You are not leaving this house.

<i>Ama,</i> I'm 22!
Besides, what if she's
in danger?

What if she's in danger?

-Jaime, you flew
out of the roof.
-You don't understand.

-He's into her.
-Oh, he totally is.

-No, I'm not.
-Oh!

-Stalked her Insta.
-Where'd I put my...

She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

And she's single, by the way.

Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

She's single?

I thought you weren't into her.

What are you doing
with my phone?

You left it unlocked.

Yes, the Maria!
Yes, I said the same thing.

But <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>

You hear that, <i>flaco?</i>
Rudy!

No. No, no.

No. No. No!

Jaime!

No! No! No!

Ma!

So itchy, this thing.

Ay, okay.

No way.

What the...

Wait, what?

Jenny?

Oh, my gosh.
What are you doing here?

-Just go. They're coming.
-Who's them?

Them!

-Oh, God. Okay!
-Let's go! Let's go!

Okay, okay! Oh, my God!

I told you to go!

You should have started with,
"they have guns."

Watch out!

Oh, Rudy's
gonna kill me.

Oh, my headlights!

No! My mirrors!

What the hell, man?

What's wrong with you? <i>Cabezon!</i>

Do you want some water?

My tailgate!

No, I'm... I'm good. I'm fine.

Okay.

What did you do to the Taco?

And that... that's Rudy.

My name's Cesar, okay?
And only my friends
call me Rudy.

I'm Jenny.
"I'm Jenny."

Hi, Jenny.

We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

Thinking about
turning our house into
a nuclear power plant?

I went swimming out there

by where your family
has that company.

My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

-Where is it?
-Yeah.

Allow me.

Rudy! What?

What are you doing?
Rudy!

I thought the <i>chingaderas</i>
would come out.

-Come out?
-Jeez.

-What is he talking about?
-He's talking about this.

Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

No, it doesn't look that bad.

I've seen worse.

-Where?
-You don't wanna know.

Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

It's... it's called the Scarab.

It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

Oh, that's nice.

-Weapon?
-What did she say?

What?

And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

No, I swear to you,
I had no idea
this would happen.

I mean, come on.

My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

It has to choose you.

So I'm guessing
it's chosen you.

No more blind dates.

Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

I don't know.
But we better move fast,

because my aunt
will kill us all
just to get it back.

Kill us?

No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

She's the one who sent
the assassins.

Yeah.

I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

I had no idea
it would activate.

Really. I didn't know.

That's convenient.

But she already said
she didn't know.

She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

Come on, we are the Reyes.

We've dealt with harder things.

We have?

<i>Animo.</i> We can do this.

Yeah. Yeah, <i>Apa.</i>

He's right.

Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

You know, before it
busts another hole
in our house.

Exactly.

There's a place where
we can get some answers.

But we need the key.

Okay, so where's the key?

At the Kord building.

And they're probably
on high alert over there
since I took the Scarab.

So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

Wide area motion imagery?

Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

I really don't--

Because I've been
working on something
that I believe can help us.

And it's almost finished.

If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

Mm. I love you, Ma.

Give me a couple hours.

You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

you'd be the most powerful

weapons manufacturer
in the world.

If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

during the anti-communist

counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

and a product of the school
of the Americas.

Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

-When will it be ready?
-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

We have a problem.

Well, if you'll excuse us.

Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

You lost her? How?

My men saw someone helping her.

All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

This time
I'll do it personally.

Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

Just think of how much
suffering your body
has been through.

I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

My God... What <i>we've</i> done.

Ignacio, I'm on your side.

Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

How badly crippled you were?

How broken?

I am just trying to fix you.

Okay?

Good.

I have to go back to the party.

Now, go get me that Scarab.

That's it?

I call it, <i>El Chapulin.</i>

Why?

You know,
when you make something cool,

you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

Here, be useful. Hold that.

You're sure
that this one works?

Thank you. Yes.

Unlike the junk
that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

Okay. You could have
just said yes.

Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

Hit the yellow switch.

I just did.

Okay.

Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

It's going on your tab.

So just give me,
like, one step.

Just gotta give it a little...

Oh, that's sexy.
Great.

That's... that's great.
Uh, so it works.

Uh, yeah, it works.

I'll keep the truck running.

Let's go.
Wow.

"So it works?"

Guys!

Something's happening.

What the hell is this?

<i>El Chapulin Colorado!</i>

<i>So join me and my little pals</i>

<i>and all of our Kord</i>
<i>subsidiaries...</i>

The key's here.

<i>...around the globe,</i>
<i>to build a better future.</i>

<i>A Kord future.</i>

She seemed so different
back then.

Vicki and my grandfather
started Kord Industries
together...

and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

Then, when my grandfather died,

Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

But he left everything
to my dad instead.

-Seems kind of--
-Sexist?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

in a different direction.

So, Victoria became
obsessed with erasing
my father's legacy.

Could I get a hand over here?

Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

-Just hold this.
-Okay.

There's a signal blocking
our feed.

We're being jammed out.

Lieutenant Carapax?
We got a problem.

-This is the key?
-Yeah.

Okay, let's go.

Let's go.

This is why
I don't let anyone
drive the Taco!

To be honest, I didn't
think the <i>Chapulin</i> would work.

Yeah, that's Rudy.
 He's like the Mexican Doc Brown.

No kidding. Okay.

So that's all you need?
 -Yeah.

Oh, my God.
I don't know why I thought

it was gonna be
way harder than that.

Oh, shit.

The Scarab, now!

What is he doing here?

Should we run?
He's not slowing down.

Watch out! Watch out!

<i>Hola, Jaime.</i>

Oh, my gosh. How'd you do that?

I have no idea.

Oh, he's pissed.

What the hell is that thing?

The O.M.A.C.

You're going to regret that.

<i>Defending host.</i>

Oh, my God. Quick!
Go find Rudy!

<i>- Engaging threat.</i>
Engage? No!

Oh, shit!

Okay, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, wait! Don't!

What did you do that for?
I told you not to engage.

<i>I have</i>
<i>an arsenal at my disposal.</i>

No! No weapons.

Ooh. And my song, too! Ay!

-Cesar!
-What?

-What the heck,
where's <i>cabezon?</i>
-There!

Hey! Calm down!

Oh, shit!

-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-Let's go, let's go!

Let me talk to him.

<i>Verbal</i>
<i>communication is ill-advised</i>

<i>in a combat scenario.</i>

Hey, man, look! I think this is
just one big misunderstanding--

I didn't mean
to punch you back there.

I promise, I would never--

I'm not
in control of this thing.

No, no, no,
let me explain!

Never mind. He's not listening.

<i>Permission</i>
<i>to take over host.</i>

Yes! Anything!

<i>Watch and learn, Jaime.</i>

Hey, wait, where you going?
Come on.

What the hell?

Oh, my God. My hands are guns.

<i>Threat neutralized.</i>

Oh!
What's with the blades?

<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

No, no, no.
Put the blades away.

<i>Would you</i>
<i>like to use a different weapon?</i>

No. I mean,
we don't have to kill him.

<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

Are you even
listening to me?

<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

Stop! I'm not a killer.

<i>Command accepted.</i>

Oh!

<i>Cabezon!</i>

Jaime!

Uncle Rudy.

No!

Holy shit!

Rudy!

Where do you think
you're going?

Hey! You guys
gotta get out of here!

What's with this guy?

What?

Stupid boy.

Did you think
you could beat me?

<i>Recommend lethal measures.</i>

I told you, I'm not a--

<i>Warning,</i>
<i>host concussion detected.</i>

You should have finished me

when you had the chance.

He's gonna kill him.

No. He's not.

Hold on.

Please, just don't
hurt my family.

The love you feel
for your family

makes you weak.

Cesar! What are you doing?

Okay, Kord girl.

When I tell you, pull that
handbrake and pull it hard.

-You ready?
-Oh, my gosh, this is insane.

Three, two, one.

Now!

<i>Cabezon,</i>
let's get outta here!

Is he okay? Jaime! Jaime!

Jenny! Snap out of it!

Okay.
 -Don't look, don't look!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm fine, Rudy. Thank you.

All right. I got a T-shirt.
On the side.

All right. Okay.

Man...

Oh, that psycho
almost killed me.

You got the key?

-All right.
-Yeah.

Good. Now, let's go get
that Scarab taken out of you.

-Khaji-Da.
-Khaji <i>que?</i>

The Scarab's name is Khaji-Da.

How do you know?

I... Something happened
back there. My...

It's like I feel it in my mind.
Is that crazy?

You're becoming symbiotic.

-What?
-Okay, where to now?

-Take that exit.
-What? Hold on!

No, no, no!

Does anybody
in this town
know how to drive?

Oh!

They're not gonna
look for you here?

No one's been here
since I was eight.

Yeah, I get it.
That makes sense.

So, your dad was all
obsessed with Scarabs, huh?

Where are we?

No way.

Wait.

Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

Wow!

What the hell is Blue Beetle?

Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

But just, uh...

I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

Oh, I get it though.

Eccentric billionaire,
a genius.
<i>El Escarabajo Azul.</i>

Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

You can call me Cesar or Rudy.

You can call me whatever
you want, I don't care.

Hey, how come all of this--

-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

Um, what were you saying?

Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like--

Nicer? Less ridiculous?

No. But I mean...

Like, look at this.
It's like Batman's stuff,
but...

like if he had ADHD
or something.

Batman's a fascist.

The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

Let's crack into this sucker.

-Damn, you stink.
-This is your shirt.

Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

Jeez.

When is this day gonna end?

Whoa.

Ay.

Is everything okay?

Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

Yeah, I think they, uh...
I think they fit.

And they're comfy, too, so...

Good.

It must have been
so cool growing up
in a place like this, no?

Honestly, it was...

it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

It was just
you three in here?

Yeah.

That was my mother's
last painting.

Why'd she stop?

My mom died when I was six.

Oh... We don't...

-I'm so sorry to...
-It's okay. No, it's okay.

It's fine.

What was she like?

She was great.

She was great.

She changed my dad's life.

She was the one who taught him
that the world

is a place to protect.

Nice.

But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

He obsessed over the Scarab

and he would disappear
for days.

Sometimes weeks.

And one day, he...

he left and...

didn't come back.

I'm so sorry, Jenny.

You're really lucky.

This house is...
it's full of stuff.

Your house is full of love.

A family.

Yeah.

That's a home.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Sorry for... for what?

I... I haven't
talked about this
in a very long time.

Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

Thank you.

Yeah.

You're a good listener.

My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

Hey, guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

-Nothing happened.
-Her mom died.

I found something you guys
need to look at.

Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

Nice jammies, <i>guey.</i>

Okay.
I've gone through the files.

So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

before it chose you, Jaime.

And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

It didn't go up my ass.

Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

It's trying to become one
with you.

Why?

I think you should
ask it yourself.

I mean, this thing
has its own will.

It's sentient.

That's why it chooses a host.

That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

This wasn't made
on Earth, <i>cabezon.</i>

-No way.
<i>-Si</i> way.

It's alien.

Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

You might want to sit down.

-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

I got good news
and I got bad news.

The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

Fine.

And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

-What?
-Dead.

What do you
mean "dead"?

Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

It's completely coiled
around your brain.

And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

It's designed
to protect its host.

To keep it alive.

So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

No, it's not forever.

I mean, it's just until you...

until you die.

I think it's kinda cool.

No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabron.</i>

I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

So, option one is
to become an android

for the rest of my life.

Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

All I wanted was a job.

Maybe there's a--
Maybe what, Rudy?

It's all bad news.

Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

I don't understand
why you can't...

God.

Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

Jaime, just...

Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

<i>Cabezon,</i> wait up.

God.

There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

Like a cat, Jaime.

I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...

It's not lost on me
that your situation

is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

Yeah, we're...

we're resilient people.

Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

I was ten. I think he was 19.

And people think
crossing the border is hard.

Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

Any <i>ja</i> he could
get his hands on.

<i>Jornalero,</i> bus boy, waiter.

He was a mechanic,
<i>era de todo,</i> dishwasher.

And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

That's what we come from.

The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

And not just some
foot up our ass.

Hey, but what do I know, huh?

I'm just some failed promise

that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

Don't say that, man.

You're not a failed promise.

Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

I am the shit.
Yeah.

And... and I love you.

And I love you, too, <i>cabezon.</i>
Yeah, all right.

Guys?

Do you hear that?

That's Victoria.

Where are they going?

Home.

You're wasting
too much water.

It's always my fault.

Yeah.

Guys?

I think there's somebody
at the window.

<i>Jaime Reyes,</i>
<i>come out with your hands up.</i>

<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

<i>We are authorized</i>
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

<i>Jaime Reyes,</i>
<i>come out with your hands up...</i>

<i>We are authorized</i>
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

Okay. Okay.

Um...

I'm gonna fly. I'm gonna fly.

Let's do this.

Yeah!

Yeah, no chance.

Now!

-Ay!
-Dude, no worries.

-Just take your time.
-Thanks, Jenny.

-You gotta force it
to come out.
-What do you...

Oh. Oh.

-You're a genius.
-I know. What'd I say?

You said this thing's
gonna protect me, right?

I...
It's not gonna let me die?

No, no. I mean, when you die...

All right, let's see if it works.
 -I wouldn't test it.

-No, no, no, Jaime!
-Wait, wait, wait, Jaime!

Well, back to the Tacoma,
I guess.

Yeah.

<i>We have</i> <i>the Reyes house surrounded.
</i> <i>The family's inside.</i>

<i>You know what to do.</i>

Round them up!

Breach team, go.

On me.

We're in!

Fan out. Flash!

Clear!

-Get the light on.
-I got your left!

Back room, clear!

Clear!

Hands on your head.
Don't move.

Okay, okay.
Don't move!

-Don't touch my family!
-Get up!

Let's go! Up, up!

Hands up! Watch your two!

Miss Kord,
we found the family.

We got 'em coming out.
 Take 'em out.

Let's go.

Drag them out!

Come on! Let's go, come on!

Let her go!
Move, move!

Let's go, let's go!

Let's go!

Do not resist!

No! No! No!

Get on the ground.
On the ground!

Get down, now!
Let's go, now!

The kid's not there.

Find him!

Is he inside?

Where is he?

Where is he?

Where is he?

I could use
that arsenal right about now.

<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

Hell yeah!

Nice work, Khaji.
You guys okay?

-Jaime?
-Sorry, I'm late, Mom.

Magnificent.

Wait, what?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Look, don't shoot.
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

<i>Fire!</i>

God damn it!
I said don't shoot.

Oh, my God. I'm bulletproof.

Let's see what you can do.

Target the family.

<i>- Engage.</i>
Take 'em out.

I got you guys.
Don't worry.

It's gonna be okay.

Okay, let's see what you got.

<i>Eliminating threats.</i>

What? No, Khaji, no killing.

Yeah, that's more like it.

Get out of here.

Run!

<i>Analyzing threat level.</i>

Okay. Let's do this.

Hell yeah!

Down on the ground!

<i>Papi!</i>
Mili!

We got one.

Stay down.
Don't move.

Stay where you are.

No!
<i>- We got another one.</i>

Dad!

Come to papa.

Carapax, ready the claw.

Daddy, I'm scared.

Everything
is gonna be okay.

<i>- Jaime, your family.</i>
Stay down!

Okay, come on, <i>Papi.</i>

Mili, get Dad outta here. Go!

-Go!
-Okay. Okay, let's go.

Ready.

<i>They have a weapon.</i>
<i>I suggest we retreat.</i>

No way. They attack my family,
we're gonna finish this.

And...

Dad.

Dad, no. Dad, what's wrong?

Dad! Dad!

No, no, no! Dad!

No!

No, no, no.

Dad!
No!

Now!

Now, what's happening?

<i>Symbiotic systems...</i>
Khaji, do something!

Dad, no!

Dad! <i>Apa!</i>

<i>-Apa!</i>
-Jaime!

No. No, no, no.

No.

No, Jaime.

Jaime, watch out!

You! You!

What do you want with us?

Dad, no!
What are you doing?

Get this thing off of me,
you psycho!

Mom!

<i>- Mami!</i>
Mili!

Alberto!

Alberto.

Let me go!

Khaji, do something!
I got him. Let's go.

<i>Apa!</i>

Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.
Wake up.

<i>Apa!</i>

I'm gonna come...
I'm gonna come get you.

Call an ambulance.

Clear!

Clear! Clear!

Mm?

Nana is right, Mili.
We have to go and save Jaime.

How? Okay,
we don't even know
where they took him.

I might know
where he is.

Please.

Come with me.

I can help.

Watch your step.

All right.

Let's do this.

Let's go.

Okay, okay.

I'm done, I'm done.

Okay, guys.

Let's hope
this Kord tech works.

Hang on.

Okay...

Dude!

There.
 -<i>Welcome back</i> <i>to the Bug Ship, Teddy.</i>

Oh, that's sexy.

Look at you.

This is sick.
Thrusters!

Let's go get our boy.
Let's do this.

Jenny.

Okay. Good, good,
good. Good.

So, what's the plan
when we get there?

We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

That's not
how you say--

<i>Ama,</i> I'm flying!

Whoo!

After 15 years,
everything we've done,

every sacrifice we've made,

has led to this moment.

Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

Almost there.

We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

Are you ready?

I'm ready.

Is this thing bulletproof?

Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

Oh, no, no.
 That's not what you think it is.

It's just a special prototype

my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

Do these things work?

Mm... some of them.

Sometimes.

Whoa.

Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

Try pressing another button.

Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

how to use these things?

Nana?

Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

This is where
they took Jaime.

Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

The place is a fortress.

Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

What the hell?

Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

about Nana's
revolutionary past.

Her what?

Yeah,
the generators are here.

Mm.
We could blow them up

and knock power out.

Hm?

Damn, Nana.

Hey, who are you?

What're you doing?
Get me out of this thing,
please?

Is there a problem,
Sanchez?

I'm sorry.

You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

Tell her to get me out of this!

It's okay. It's okay.

Yeah. Listen, kid.

The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

But now that you've
activated it,

we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

What are you
even talking about?

No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

Oh, bummer.

Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

Do it, Sanchez.

With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

Damn it.

Bug.

Rudy.
Yeah, I see it.

You're going too fast!

Here goes nothing.

Hold on, hold on!

All right. All right.

Incoming!

Brace for impact!

Let's go, let's go!

On the wall! Engage. Engage.

Rudy, do something.

Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

Here we go!

Whoa.

Okay, okay.

Get out of the way. Sorry!

It's like I can't miss.
Right there, right there.

Twenty points!
Whoo-hoo!

Activating cloaking system.

<i>Activating bug fart.</i>

Take that!

Whoo!

-Yeah, this way.
-Okay.

Hey! Come on.

I know you can hear me.

Just let me out!

I'll keep it safe.

Start the transfer.

And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

Get me out of here!

But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

from his connection
to the Scarab--

We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

Let me out! No! No!

Milagro, here, hide!

Holy shit.

Okay, I think we're good.

What the...

Victoria, you crazy bitch.

What the hell
is this?

Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

Enough to build an entire army.

Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

What's going on?

Oh, no.
The Scarab download

is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

What does it mean?

The transfer is killing him.

He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

His pulse is dropping.

Well, just fix it!

Hey, <i>flaco.</i>

Dad.

What's going on?

What are you doing here?

You know.

No. <i>Apa.</i>

Milagro, here.
Help me with these.

Jaime.

This is not your time.

You have to go back.

Please.

I understand everything now.

My destiny was
to be here with you.

In this moment.

To help you cross into it.

This is your purpose.

<i>It's time for you</i>
<i>to accept your destiny, Jaime.</i>

How am I gonna
do this without you?

How am I
gonna know what to do?

I love you, too, <i>Papi.</i>

Something's happening.

What?

His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

Right there.
They're connecting.

I need you, Khaji!

They're becoming one.

We've got the code?

The transfer's complete.

The code is ours.

It's working!

Oh, no.

Go, go, go!

Okay. Here we go.

Okay, let's go.
Yeah.

No. No, no, no.

Sanchez, stop him!

Oh, shit.

What?

Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

-Wait, wait, wait. My family?
-Quickly!

What do you mean my family?

Go!

Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

My name is not Sanchez,
<i>pendeja!</i>

It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

What are you doing?

Stop him, Carapax.

Go. I'll be fine.

Okay, Khaji, come on.

Okay.
All right, Khaji, activate!

<i>Rebooting.</i>

Rebooting? Are you kidding me?

Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

-Go, go, go.
-Okay, okay, okay.

Milagro, wait.

-Oh, no, no, no.
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

No, no, watch out!

Jenny.

Jenny?

Jenny!

Finally, I can feel it.

Oh...

Now this look really suits you.

Okay.

Okay, Khaji.
All right, Khaji-Da.

You got this. You can do this.

Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

<i>Still rebooting.</i>

Come on!

Freeze!

Stay right there!

Come on.

Don't move.

Take him down.

Nana?

Okay.

Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

Keep your eyes
peeled.

Milagro!

Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

What a mess you have made.

Let's go.
On your feet. Get up!

<i>Ama.</i>

Yeah.

Sheez.

Milagro.
Where is she?

Milagro and Jenny.
They're in there.

Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

Okay, I need to head
back in there, okay?

Yeah.
What about the suit?

It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

-Jaime.
-Yes?

Okay.

Uh... Rudy, what's that
<i>chongo</i> thing called again?

Khaji-Da.

Right.

I know you can hear me,
Khaji-Da.

I want you both
to get it together.

Find your strength, <i>mijito.</i>

Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

I want you
to go back in there...

I found one of them.

Sick.

-Drop your weapon.
-Oh, goddamn it.

Hey! <i>Pendejos!</i>

<i>Rebooting complete.</i>

Get the hell away
from my sister.

-I'm out.
-I'm out.

You ready Khaji?

Come on, let's get it.

Who's first?

Oh, you want some?

Wait, wait, wait! Watch out!

Engage the target.

Let's go!

Oh, man, there's more.

Grab him!

What the hell?
Get 'em off of me!

<i>With pleasure.</i>

Thanks, Khaji.
De nada.

Halt!

<i>One more left.</i>

Get over here!

Come on.

Come on.

Nice slap.

Okay, I deserve that one.

I thought
I'd never see you again.

I told you I wasn't
going anywhere.

Well, you did.
Yeah, that wasn't my--

Rudy! Rudy!

Mili, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

You're safe.
I thought I lost you.

No, no. Look.

Hey, hey, hey.

Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Jenny?

We got separated. I don't know.

Okay, we have to find her.

Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do
because I--

Watch out!

What the hell was that?

<i>O.M.A.C. incoming, Jaime.</i>

Ah, crap.

Get off!

Okay, let's do this, Khaji!

Give me rockets or something.

<i>Deploying blasters.</i>

Okay, now give me blades.

Okay, now give me--

<i>Careful,</i>
<i>he's stronger than before.</i>

Okay, I get it.

Okay,
which way do we go?

Go to the Bug Ship.
It's that way.

-But where are you going?
-I'm gonna get <i>Cabezon.</i> Go!

<i>Critical wing damage.</i>

Scratch my back?
Well, I'll scratch yours.

All right, big boy.

You do not deserve this power!

I thought you'd
hit harder than that.

Okay, we need
something else, Khaji.

<i>Accessing energy reactor.</i>

There we go.

All right,
you wanna dance, huh?

Now, give me a sword.

So I can make whatever
weapons I want, huh?

<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you can imagine, I can create.</i>

Let's party.

<i>Nice choice.</i>

Let's go!

Home run! Whoo!

Oh, yeah!

Come on.
That's all you got?

<i>Let's not</i>
<i>get ahead of ourselves, Jaime.</i>

Khaji, don't worry.
We got this.

Okay, this is a little
harder than I thought.

<i>Regenerative systems critical.</i>

What the hell?

There can
only be one of us.

Khaji, do something!

What's wrong?
Can't breathe?

<i>Jaime,</i>
<i>I cannot protect you anymore.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

Khaji, Khaji, stay with me.

You are still
a scared little boy.

I told you,

the love you feel
for your family...

makes you weak.

Hey!

Come on!
Come and get me.

Come on!

Rudy.

Oh, shit.

No!

Rudy!

Khaji-Da!

Your O.M.A.C. has failed.

Jennifer, you don't know
what the O.M.A.C. is.

Carapax is just a prototype.

This is the only thing
that's important.

The Scarab code.

With this, I can make
a thousand Carapaxes.

This is the culmination
of my life's work.

This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

Not mine. I'll make sure of it.

You're... you're gonna side
with that Edge Key trash

over your own family?

That Edge Key trash...

knows more about
family than you ever will.

I know. No, I know
about family.

I know about my family
that overlooked me,

just the way that you are now,

because you are
just like your pathetic father,

who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

for the greater good.

I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

Oh!

No! We're not done!

<i>Jaime, threat disarmed.</i>

<i>You're losing control.</i>

You think
that you could beat me? Huh?

You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

<i>O.M.A.C. neutralized.</i>
<i>Recommend to disengage.</i>

What are you doing?

<i>We are not killers, Jaime.</i>

<i>Let him go.</i>

What about Dad?

What about Rudy?

<i>During the transfer,</i>
<i>I unlocked his memories.</i>

<i>Let me show you.</i>

What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

Then we'll just
get another one.

It could kill him.

Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

<i>This country is</i>
<i>confronting a brutal challenge,</i>

<i>from guerrillas</i>
<i>armed and supported</i>

<i>by others outside Guatemala.</i>

<i>The United States</i>
<i>is committed to restoring</i>
<i>democracy</i>

<i>and to address the root causes</i>
<i>of the violent insurgency.</i>

<i>We know</i>
<i>about the problems</i>

<i>confronting Guatemala.</i>

Perfect. Round them up.

<i>Mama!</i>

Ignacio!

<i>Do you understand now?</i>

Hey! <i>Cabezon!</i>

You're wrong.

That love that
I have for my family...

that's what makes me strong.

All right, give it to me.
Come on.

-This?
-Yes, that.

No!
Now what have you done?

No! No, no!

Jenny?

It's okay.

Carapax, kill them.

Kill them both!

Okay.

What are you doing?
They're getting--

Okay.

No.

Wait, Jenny, wait.

Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

-What?
-I promise.

We can be partners, huh?

I'll f... I'll fix it.
I'll fix you.

We can find another Sanchez.

Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

No.

Khaji, what's he doing?

<i>He's maxing out</i>
<i>the energy reactor in his suit.</i>

<i>I advise we back away.</i>

<i>Ignacio.</i>

What? What?

What, no! What are you doing?

Stop! No! No!

Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

No! Please! No!

Ignacio, no! Stop!

<i>I suggest we run.</i>

Okay. Oh, shit.

Milagro, pull!

Rocio!

You okay?

Hi.

Mili.

<i>Cabezon.</i>

Rudy?

Rudy!

-How?
-Yeah. You know...

<i>Ama.</i>

Nana.

<i>It is a delicate moment</i>
<i>for Kord Industries.</i>

<i>And of course, we mourn</i>
<i>the loss of Victoria Kord.</i>

<i>But I'm looking forward.</i>

<i>As I was saying,</i>
<i>we will no longer make weapons.</i>

<i>What I want to do is honor</i>
<i>my father's legacy.</i>

<i>It's not about destruction,</i>

<i>it's about building</i>
<i>a better future.</i>

<i>It's not about taking</i>
<i>from the community,</i>

<i>but giving back</i>
<i>to the community.</i>

What are we gonna do now?

<i>Animo,</i> Rudy, okay?

We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

Hey! The Reyes are here.

Guys.

Nana.

Okay.

Where, <i>Ama?</i>
We don't have a house.

Rudy, we have, like,
half the Edge Keys
in our yard right now.

I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

Of course
they're going to help.

Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

I wouldn't worry about that.

Jenny, Jenny.

Hi.

I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

to the people
that made it great.

Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

on Jenny Kord, no?

Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

Starting with you, Rudy.

Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

Rudy, I didn't say shit.

That sounds like something
that you would say to her
to tell me.

And don't worry,
Kord Industries

will fix and give you back
your house.

Excuse me.

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

-Here, Rudy.
-What's this?

I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

How do you like that, cupcake?

Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

Rudy.
Rudy. "Thank you."

I'll think about it.
Yeah, take a look.

Oh, wow.
Come on, help me like it.
I'm inheriting that.

All right, I gotta go.

Yeah.

How about I walk you out?

-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

So, uh...

when am I gonna
see you again?

Soon. I hope.

Where are you headed?

To my dad's.

I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

I forgot how beautiful
they are.

Cool, cool.

Uh...

What if I gave you a ride?

How?

<i>I feel a surge of blood</i>

<i>rushing towards</i>
<i>your mid-region.</i>

Stop!

No, no, no. Not you.

Oh.

What's it saying?

Nothing.

Okay.

Hold on.

Okay.

<i>â™ª I'm all out of love,</i>
<i>What am I without you? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't be too late</i>
<i>I know I was so wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm all out of love,</i>
<i>I'm so lost without you â™ª</i>

<i>Hello, hello?</i>

<i>Oh, my God, it's working.</i>
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

<i>Whoever turned on my computer,</i>

<i>get a message</i>
<i>to my daughter, Jenny.</i>

<i>Jenny Kord.</i>

<i>Please,</i>
<i>tell her that I love her,</i>

<i>and that I'm sorry,</i>

<i>and her dad is alive.</i>

<i>Ted Kord is alive.</i>

<i>Oh, that's sexy.</i>
