Je m'appelle Victoria

Je m'appelle Victoria

Comment allez-vous?

Santé... no... no...

My sister sent me a postcard

All it said was: come to Paris,
it will be good for you

48 hours after I arrived...

...she and everyone I've
met were dead

Open the bag

Sorry?

Open the bag
Open my bag? Ok

Have you been in Paris before?

No, I've never been
here before

I get nervous sometimes

Ne comprend vous francais?
Sorry? I don't understand

She asked you if
you understand French

No, I don't speak french

Are you staying in a hotel room?

I'm staying with my sister

Hey, welcome to Paris

Have you fun yet?

She's... I don't know where
she's staying...

...but she studies
at the Sorbone

Her address?

I don't know. I'm sorry
She's picking me up at the airport

I don't know

Welcome to France

This trip is gonna
change you forever

Aren't you excited?

Yeah definitely. I just
have a headache

There is the sister I remember

Where are we going?

This is where you live?

Yep. Is pretty creepy, right?

Got a good deal with the rent, though

You'll loved this

France's first serial killer
had a room on the fifth floor

He chopped a bunch of bodies
before someone complains...

...about the noise the bone saw
is making everyday

They making proud of him
But the guy went fucking mental

By the time the cops got here,
he already killed everyone in the fourth...

After the massacre
everyone moved out...

Too much bad blood, they said

What?
I'm just fucking with you

It's just a shit building

You gotta learn to lighten up, honey

There's not a homicidal maniac
lurking in every shadow

Alright. Turn the light on,
would you?

I don't know where the light is

I wasn't talking to you

What?

Is every single moment of your life
into scare the shit out of people?

Even that as a suggestion
breaks my heart, Carolyn

Don't take it personal. They do it
to everyone. Are you ok?

Yeah, I know is...
Where I'll sleep?

Sleep in Baltimore, Vic

Nor even the dead sleep in Paris

It's just I didn't sleep
on the plane last night

I was nervous about the flight
so I can't sleep...

Yeah, well... Sorry there's no time

We got a party to get ready for

Sorry? There's no way I can
go to a party tonight

Not dressed like mom,
you can't

C'mon. Let's go shopping

Do you feel ok?

Yeah...

Sure don't have anything
to say to Quasimodo?

What do you think so far?

Of what?

Of what? Of Paris!

Look around you, is the
most beautiful city in the world!

The City of light. Romance,
art, architecture, beauty...

It's hard to imagine that stays on top
of the larger mass grave of the history

C'mon. You can't go to a
party without the shoes

Oh, God! You scared me!

You? You usually are
so calm and collected

What are you taking?

Nothing... I told you I have a headache

Well, spin that ass!
The taxi's coming

Victoria, this is my dear friend Hugo...

He's one of the hosts of
the most fabulous party...

Hugo, this is my infamous
sister Victoria

Je m'appelle Victoria

We all speak english here, sister

Ok
Ok

What am I? An amateur?

No. This is for your sister

For me?

Ladies, please. Come in
Au revoir, mon cherie

C'mon sis

Carolyn wait
Where are we going?

It's too late to turn back now

I don't understand
What kind of party is this?

This is the kind of party
that'll change your life

It changed mine, anyway

Seriously, why anybody want to
throw a party down here?

Because this is where the
dead bodies are

You're just trying to scare me?
Aren't you?

I'm not. I swear. Everything
I'd say is absolutely true

Paris' dirty old secrets

"Abandon all hope
here you enter"

Pretty

200 years ago, Paris ran out
of room to bury its dead

The graveyards were stuffed,
like fifteen bodies deep

The corpses were rotting
in the streets

Some brilliant person decides to
start over. Just dig out the bodies...

...of every dead person
in Paris. All seven millions of them...

...and stuck their bones in this
mines shafts under the left bank

Seven millions?
Isn't that funny?

Don't the police try to stop you?

They tried. They created a whole task force
to shut us down. The "catacops"

There's 300 miles of tunnels under the city
and we never go party the same place twice

Que-ce tu fais?
Que-ce tu fais?

Do you remember Nico and Leon?

Hey

Let's move, Jean-Michele
is waiting for us

Who is Jean-Michele?

You'll meet him

He and Hugo were who came with
the idea of throw out parties down here

...have become more and more popular...

I have being accused in the press
of being in love with the death

A kind of necrophilia, I suppose

But in ancient Greece, it was
a practice of philosophers...

...to keep a human skull
on their desk

The idea was this...

...only with a conscious awareness...

...of our pending death

Can we appreciate our life fully

I always found myself
persuaded by that sentiment

The only problem is...

...I never own a desk!

Welcome to the Catacombs!

Hello!

Hey there!

A water, please?

Can I have a water, please?

You don't have to drink here

Are you Jean-Michele?
Carolyn has told me a lot about you?

What did she say?

She said you are
afraid of the darkness

I'm not, really

You're not? Because I am
We all are

Why the hell do you come
to this place, then?

"It is God's kindness to terrify us
so that we become stronger"

Where am I suppose to drink?

You're wasting your time, Jean-Michele

She doesn't drink alcohol

It's not alcohol
It's absinthe

Go, go, go. C'mon!
She did it!

I can see this going very badly

Hey! Space cadet!
Are you okay?

So, since you arrived in Paris...
Did you see a ghost yet?

That line is getting so old...
She's in Paris...

The most haunted city in the world
It is a legitimate question

Look around you
Six million people...

Torn from the ground and stacked
under your feet like wood for the fire...

If there are ghost anywhere,
there are ghosts in Paris

If there are ghosts anywhere,
there are ghosts in this place!

You know, he's absolute right
The catacombs are haunted

But not by ghouls or specters
The catacombs are haunted by people

The lowest creeps and lunatics drown
down from the surface by morbidity

Death is a spectacle
An opera

When the cult of the Black Virgin
began inverting the rites of...

...Catholiscism. Painting
the statue of Mary in black...

...and praying to Satan...

Even when those people claimed to have
given birth to the Antichrist

No sane person
took them seriously

But they did

They take a child...

...born of the incest...

...raised on raw meat...

...they never allow
him to see daylight...

...tought him he was
the destroyer of man

Dress him in a gruesome goatskin mask
What do you expect?

By the time the boy was eighteen...
They have succeeded

They have created...

...a hawking...

...unthinking lunatic...

...so evil...

...that definitive he could
be called the Antichrist

C'mon! A killer with a goat mask?

It's just another myth
A more frightened one, but...

...still a myth

There's articles in the newspapers
every week about people that come down...

...to the catacombs and
never make it out

No, this is not a myth
This monster they had created...

...is down here.
Somewhere

Ok, you guys don't go to graduate
school with Carolyn. Do you?

Let's go swimming

What do you say sis?
Do you like taking a dip?

C'mon Vic! Nobody gives a shit
Get over it!

Get naked. Get in the water

Carolyn...

Carolyn
C'mon! Take 'em out!

It just your body.
You have a beautiful body

You didn't see the Balboa

Is nothing, you guys. I'm just
a little cold. That's all

Yeah, right. Otherwise she
would been the first one in

But it's cold!
I'm wanna go home!

You know, Vic. You might try
for once in your life...

...to not be the lamest
person in the room

Leave her alone!

Well, it gotta be me, right?
I think I'm gonna go back to the party

That sounded much more
hateful that I meant

Can somebody show me
the way back to the party?

Is that way

Looks like you're stuck.
And you have to go swimming

It's ok. I'll find it
Vic, don't be a retard...

...you can go back alone.
You gonna get lost

It's a maze.
Vic! Seriously!

Vic!

As with us soon you shall be

Is what it says

You scared me
Good

People like you
need to be scared

I'm serious, dumbass.
Don't walk out like that. It's dangerous

Sound doesn't travel in the Catacombs.
You could get lost before you know it

You're not lost.
Are you?

No. I don't think so

Maybe I'm lost

Are you serious?

What's so funny?

Whoever wrote that doesn't think
it matters which way we go

What it's say?

"There is but one way
to enter this life...

...but the gates of death
are outnumbered"

That's great

What the fuck was that?

I though you said sound
doesn't travel down here

It doesn't. Stay here

I get it

The guys are just trying to
scare you. They live for that shit

Bye! Fuck off!

Carolyn, I wanna
go home. Please

Wait! Wait!
Can you feel that?

What?

The music in my feet. The bass.
We're almost back to the party

C'mon! Dance with me

What happened? Turn on the
light! What happened?

Why it went out?
The batteries must be dead!

Hang on!
What?

What do you mean
they're dying?

Batteries die.
The light starts to glimmer

Oh my God!
What we got here?

The flashlight is dying!
It's ok!

No it's not. The batteries
are dying

You're such a spaz!

Oh my God!
What are we gonna do?

Why they still doing that?
It's not funny!

You can't be my sister
You had to be adopted

All I wanna say is how
can you be so calm right now?

Because of the first rule
on the Catacombs

Always brings more
than one light source

Do you see, spaz?
Not everything is a crisis

C'mon. The party is closer

Carolyn!

Carolyn!

Carolyn! No!

Carolyn! please!

Please!

Help!

Help me!

Help!

No!

My God

Please, light

Please, light. Please, light

You can't just steal somebody's
flashlight. You jerk!

Wait!

Do you know where you're going?
Do you know where you're going?

You have to be careful

Are you listening to me?

What is that?

Is that a map?

Plan. Oui.
A "plan" of this place?

Let me see

It's a street map. Up there.
A street map

It's moi!

For God's sake. Stop that!

Rue Saint Medard?
What? So...?

Hey, stop! Hello?

You know what you're doing?

These are the same as above on the
street level. The same intersections?

Sortie.

There's another exit.
Oui. Oui.

Where are we?

Sortie!
Oh, my God. That's so far!

So what happened?

Were... Were you at the party?
Were you at the party?

Did you get lost, too?

Hey!
Could you wait up?

Attention!
Please, slow down a little

Please, slow down

Don't touch me!

D'accord!

You're going too fast
I can't see anything

Hey!

Wait!

Where do you going?

What are you doing?

Why are we st...?

Why are we stopping?
We have to keep going

What are you hiding?

What is that?

Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

What are you doing?

What are you doing? Don't

I knew it. My sister...
Man, I'm hungry...

Can we go eat?
You really thought I was dead?

That's histerical

You really thought I was
dead this whole time. Didn't you?

I knew it! Oh my God...

That's histerical!

You thought I was really
dead this whole time. Didn't you?

We fake the slash
It's stage blood

There's no monster, it was just
a prank.

It was Hugo on a mask.
Will you show her?

Look. Do you see?

It was just a joke

A joke?

Not a joke.
A prank, an initiation

The cult of the Black Virgin.
The monster on the goat mask...

...it's just an underground haunted
house meant to scary us fast

This guys is been doing it for years

We're gonna explain everything
but the cops showed up...

...and raid us and separated us

It's been safer for you
be down there, sis.

We've been call you for hours

Hello?

Victoria! Stop running!

Victoria!

Victoria!

It's the walls.
You can't hear nothing

Leave alone me!

No...
My God. Henri!

Hey, stop being such a
drama queen

We kill him!

No, we shouldn't did what we did.
But that what's these guys do

Every single moment of your life is
into scaring shit out of people?

Didn't you see a ghost yet?

They just trying to scare you.
They live for that shit

We thought it would be for you

Hey!

You scared me!

Good. People like you
need to be scared

There's not homicidal maniac
lurking in every shadow

Jean-Michele always says when
you survive your own death, you reborn

Is the whole reason we
come down to the Catacombs

Only with the conscious awareness
of our pending death...

...can we appreciate our lifes fully

Why do you think I wanted you
to came here in the first place?

I thought it will help you
to get over your issues...

...to get rid of those stupid
pills once and for all

Where is Jean-Michele?
I don't know

Have you seen him?

Merde, qui est qu'il est Ià?
Holy shit! Jean-Michele!

God! Oh my God!
Stop shaking him!

Is he dead?

Jean-Michele!
God!

Get of him!
Stop shaking him!

No, no, not
Jean-Michele! No!

Check his pulse!

Jean-Michele!

How fucking this could happen?

Jean-Michele!

No... no...

You stupid, fucking cunt!

His dead! How you could
to be so fucking stupid?

What's going on in that
stupid head of yours?

Look what you fucking did!
Get up and look what you did!

Look what you did!
Look what you fucking did!

I'm sorry
Stupid fucking bitch!

I fucking hate you!

Everything you ever done in your
fucking life is a mistake

You're sorry?
Always fucking sorry!

You ruined everything!
I fucking hate you so much!

Look what you did!
There's something wrong with you!

Look what you did
you fucking idiot!

I wish you were dead! You're so
stupid you couldn't even kill yourself!

What is fucking wrong with you?
You stupid... Everywhere...

You should kill yourself...
Crazy stupid bitch!

Everything you...

Nooooo!

My sister sent me a postcard

All it said was: "Come to Paris
It'll be good for you"

48 hours after I arrived...

She and everyone I've
met were dead

Airport, please
