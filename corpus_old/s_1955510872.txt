Woman:
You know how it is.

You think your life
is normal.

You're happy.
You're a little kid.

Doesn't matter
where you are.

Where we were
was Brooklyn.

My dad was born there,

we were born there.

The main thing I remember
is running,

always running,

to things, from things.

Running with my sister,
who was always ahead.

My mom running
from the Nazis.

She was like
a real-life Anne Frank

hiding out during the war,
except she lived.

She was rescued
by American soldiers.

Dad was
the Jewish single one...

and they
ran away together.

Dad loved to get away,

so we were always
running somewhere,

going somewhere.

Dad liked to promise us
the world.

(Man whistling melody)

It's not like we wanted
to leave Brooklyn,

but all of a sudden,
we were.

For someone who was scared
of almost everything,

I was okay with that.

I was going to be
a famous writer,

so, it didn't matter
where I lived.

A lot of great writers
came from New York,

but a lot of great writers
came from the South too.

A good writer
can write anywhere,

like Anne Frank.

She wrote behind a bookcase
in the attic.

And we brought
our dog buddy,

who was 14 and could barely
make it around the block.

Girl:
Antarctica.

Mmm.

Atlanta.

Uh...

I got one
for you, maddie.

Arkansas,
ends with an "s."

I know about
the "s." Um...

Come on.
"S" is a no-brainer.

I quit.

What do you mean,
you quit?

You can't quit
with an "s."

I just don't want
to play anymore.

Well, we got
500 more Miles to go.

Got something better
to do?

What about Spain?
I said I'm done, okay?

Father:
You're done. You're
done with an "s."

What about Seattle,
San Francisco,

Saudi Arabia?
Come on.

There's a whole world
of s's out there.

Narrator:
I wouldn't miss Brooklyn,

not really, but maddie,
my sister, she was 17.

She was furious.

She was popular
in high school,

popular enough to know
that nothing was worse

than being a new senior

in a new high school
in the South.

For all we knew,

we'd be the only Jewish
family in new Orleans.

I'd like a coke,
please.

That's
a nice accent.

I'm not the one
with the accent.

Lenny.

Lenny, please.
Come on.

Let's get the deal
papered first

because we start
talking ipos.

Come on, let's go.
It's getting late.

Daddy, this is
the ladies' room.

I want to get going
before dark.

What are you wasting time
with this yutz for?

Just talking.

Yeah, well, come on.
We're late.

Hey, what's a yutz?

Look in
the mirror.

Narrator:
So I asked my dad,

"why are we moving
to Louisiana?"

He'd been a new yorker
even as a dirt-poor kid.

He told me he needed to be
closer to his factory,

400 people making blouses
in the South.

Besides, the dollar
goes further there,

and we'd live like kings.

(Tires screech)
Oh, shit.

(Horn honking)
You bastard!

Where the hell did
you get your license?!

Narrator:
He always said
everything was fine.

I wanted to believe him.
I really did.

But we didn't always
know what to believe

when it came to dad.

(Bell rings)

Father:
Surprise, surprise.


So what
do you think?

Oh, my God, Joe.
It's incredible.

Oh-hh.

Only the best
for my beautiful wife.

This is
really it?

What's the matter?
Not enough house for you?

Girl:
Are you kidding?
It's a mansion.

Joe:
Four stories,
8,000 square feet.

And let's not forget
the olympic-size
swimming pool.

Mother:
No.


I'm going to go back
to buddy in the car.

Maddie, come on.

Come on.
You're going to love it.
Come on. Come. Just come.

What happened
to the broker, Joe?

Ah, she couldn't make it,
but she didn't want
to lose the sale.

You know, she knows
a serious buyer
when she sees one.

(Gasps)
Oh, my God.

Girl:
I love this place.

This was
designed by a famous
Southern architect.

Wow.

Built like
a goddamn fortress.

Maddie:
Or a prison.

Mother: Maybe we
could even have
your weddings here.

We'd be just like
the Kennedys.

How many bedrooms
are there?

More than you
could count, kid.

Vaulted ceilings.
Fireplace.

Come on.
We belong in a place
like this, right?

Until the guys with
the white hoods burn
a cross on our lawn.

You know, enough
with the snide remarks
maddie, okay?

I'm going
to choose a bedroom

in case
he closes the deal.

This is
amazing.

I hate
this place.

Sister:
Hey, maddie,
check this out!

Listen, I...
Joe.

Listen,
Happy Birthday.

It's yours.
It's mine?

That's right.
The house.

I bought it
for your birthday.

It's bought and paid for.
I even put it
in your name.

For putting up with me
all these years,
all right?

Joe. Oh.

Are you sure
we can afford this?

Of course
we can afford it.

Right now, I got one
of the biggest financiers

in the country
underwriting my company.

I'm building
an empire here, Stella.

An empire.


What are you doing
in there?

There's a crawlspace
in this closet.

It's a perfect
secret hiding place.

Huh.

Stella:
Girls, come quickly!

Come on.

The house is ours.
Daddy already bought it.

This can't be
happening.

When do we move in?

Well, that was
the big surprise.

Moving day
is today.

I had the movers
start packing us up

right after we left
on Thursday.

They're gonna be here
any minute.

(Girl laughs)

But you said we
were only looking.

How could you
do this to us?

Whoa, whoa.
It was a surprise.

It's okay. It's okay.
I'll take care of her.

Maddie?

Hey, come here.

(Birds chirping)

You have
to understand what
a step up this is.

You would never find
a house like this
in Brooklyn.

And besides,
your father's plant
is here.

He won't have
to fly down twice
a week anymore.

Don't you have
any say in anything?

You act like living
in this beautiful house

is some form
of punishment.

It's going
to be okay.

Hmm?

Okay.

Look, it...

I really think
it can be different
this time, maddie.

I promise.

Your daddy's
finally happy here.

Come on. Can't you
just be happy, okay?

Be happy, okay?

Be happy. Yeah.


(Movers talking
indistinctly)

Be careful
with my disco ball
there, all right?

Absolutely.
Take it easy.

Mover:
Take this.

We are planning to
buy new furniture,
right, daddy?

What's the matter?
I love that stuff.

All right,
that's it.

We are officially
moved in.

What do
you think?

It's a beaut,
right?

Something's not
quite right.

Oh.

Now, it's perfect.

(Laughs)
Come here.

What's that?
Joe: What's what?

That button.

Oh, that's
the panic button.

I installed them
everywhere.

You press
that button,

the precinct
is right down
the block.

The cops will
be here in less
than 30 seconds.

They told me
not to worry

about security,
you know,

but you don't tell
a guy from Brooklyn

not to worry
about security

when it comes
to his family.
Right, honey?

There's no way
we're going to fit in
at this school.

Maybe you won't,
but I will.

Joe, ask Natalie
to eat, please.

I'll give you
10 bucks if you finish
what's in your bowl.

I'll tell you what.
I'll give you
another 10 bucks

if you eat
two pieces of fruit.

Don't bribe her.
To you, it's a bribe.

To me,
it's a long-term
investment.

(Horn honks)
Okay? Come on.

The bus is here.

Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Come on.

Before you go,
come on.
Plant 'em.

Ah.
Pay up.

Come on. I give you
my iou, all right?

Have a good day.

Bye.

(Machinery clattering)

Good morning, ladies.
Morning.

Do my eyes deceive me,

or have I just walked
into a beauty pageant?

(Laughter)
Woman: Sweet talker.

What do you say to charm
like that, Mr. f, huh?

Do me a favor,
grace.

I want you
to call the bank

and confirm
the wire transfer
from crawley,

and get me Lenny
on the phone.

(School bell rings)

I'm Mr. Smith,

and this is
poetry seminar 111.

Before we begin
to tackle our curriculum

for you budding poets...
(Laughter)

I'd like to announce
that the sixth annual

Campbell soup
poetry competition

is now accepting
submissions.

This is an opportunity
for recognition,

prize money...

Perhaps a slice
of immortality.


Here's everything
you need to know

about making
your submission.

Take one
and pass it along, please.

My advice,

stick with a topic
that's personal,

something that comes
from down deep in the soul.

Page 42
in your poetry books.

Let's tackle
a little eliot, shall we?

Natalie fine.

Why don't you start us off
reading "the waste land"?

Natalie:
I don't think anyone

should be asked
to read aloud

on their first day
in a new school.

Smith:
Miss fine?

And t.S. Eliot
was not my favorite.

Cat got your tongue,
miss fine?


On the other hand,
let's face it.

I was a coward.

I hated reading
in front of people,

I hated speaking
in front of people,

and I never knew why.

I thought it might be
different here,

but it wasn't.

(School bell rings)

(Students talking
indistinctly)

I don't know.
Cindy's over here.

Hi.

Hey, if it isn't
the new girl in town.

I'm-I'm Louie.

Maddie.
Maddie.

I don't think
she likes what
she sees, Louie.

So, maddie,
you know, I hear...

I hear girls
from up north are
pretty friendly.

Is that true?

You got
something for me?

Oh, back off,
Louie.

Why you gotta be
such a jerk?

Can't you recognize
a lady when you see one?

Guess someone
down here's
a gentleman.

Sorry about that.
He's kind of an ass.

Hey, we're about
to go grab some
soft drinks downtown

if you want
to come with us.

I want
to go home.

Maybe next time.

All right.

Louie:
What was that?

What do you mean?
You can't just
go up to a stranger,

start touching 'em
on the leg.

Dang, man.
God, man. She's a Hebrew.

Really?
What does that mean?

(Seabirds calling)

(Stella laughing)

(Joe laughing)

Ah, it's just
a starter boat,

but I got my own
private slip to boot,
and I'll tell you what.

If you guys like it,
I got my eye
on a 40-footer.

But wait. Check out
the name over there.

Oh! Joe.
Oh, Joe.

Oh, I hope you girls
have husbands

as wonderful
as your father.

(Parents laugh)

Maddie:
That water looks
very polluted.

It's not polluted.
It's muddy.

It's the
Mississippi river.

Come on.
Let's go for a ride.

No? Really?
Get in.

Well, no time
like the present.

Joe, Joe...
Get in, girls.

Are you sure you know
how to drive this?

Of course I know
how to drive.

It's a car
on water. What's
the difference?

It goes left.
It goes right.

It stops.
It goes.

I can do it.

Here.
How's that look?

Oh, doesn't your
father look dapper?


Here we go.
All right.

Let's get ready.
Are you ready,
maddie?

We're in.
All right.

Good catch, honey.

You watch me
take control
of this boat.

I can't believe it.
A Brooklyn Jew
on the bayou.

Be careful, Joe.

Don't worry.
I was in the war,
don't forget.

Whoa. It's all right.
I'm okay.

All right, I got
my girls with me.

I'm all set to go.
Here we go.

Maddie, listen,
I'm going to get you

a pair of water skis,
all right, for the boat.

Really?
Yes.

Water skis?
Water skis.

All right, here we go.

I got it.

Whoa.

All right. Okay.

It's... I just...
(Laughing)

Just take it easy.
I got it. I got it.

Just... all right.
You know what? I need
a little hand here.

All right, look,
you got your chuckle
out of the way.

Look, I need a hand
up in front, okay?

Okay, maddie, you're fore.
You're aft.

Come on. Come on.
No, no.

Come on. Don't you guys
know the difference?

I said
fore and aft.

Really. Come on.
We're so happy.

Thank you for
the boat and the house
and everything.

We appreciate it.

All right, honey,
sit down.

Let's get going.
I want you to sit down.

We got to get ready.
All right, here we go.

I got it. All right.

That's it. I got it.

Natalie:
Maybe everything
wasn't different,

but it felt like the start
of something good.

Whoo!
Whoo!

Joe:
You just watch
daddy do it.

Ah, look at that.


Go ahead.
You can do it.

Ha! You made it.

Do it again.
You shoot again.
Go ahead.

Again?
That's right.

No, no.
I go again?

No, put
a little more chalk
on it. Try that.

Okay.
Yeah, put a little
more chalk.

Go ahead.
You can do it, then.

All right. Go ahead.

You're a pro.

You're going
to be a pro.

Let me tell you
something.

No, seriously,
it didn't go in,

but that was
a hell of a shot.

(Rock music playing)

Buddy,
what do you think?

Do I look Southern
to you, buddy?


Good boy.

Lenny, what are you
doing down here?

Hey, how are you?

You weren't
supposed to be here
for another week.

Let me
tell you something.

You better
think about staying
down here for good,

because since
I came down here,

yeah, I got
to tell you, Lenny,

I am having
the time of my life.

What's the matter?

Joe, I got
some news.

What news?

Crawley backed out
of the deal.

What are you
talking about?

He just decided
it was taking
too big a risk

with the overseas
competition being
what it is.

Yeah, all right.
So just get him
on the phone.

I'll talk him
into it.

Ah, nah, nah.
He's on a plane
to London.

He's out
of the country,
out of the deal.

I'll sue
the bastard.

Business
is dying, Joe.

We did
nothing wrong.

We just got to accept
what's happening here.

No, no, no.

I did everything
you told me to do

before crawley ever
entered the equation.

Okay?
I cut distribution.

I moved my whole
goddamn plant down South.

I uprooted my family,
for Christ sakes.

You told me that's
all I needed to do
to keep us going.

Things deteriorated
faster than we could
have imagined.

30 years I've been
in this goddamn game,

and I gotta deal
with this crap?

You put the house
in Stella's name?

The insurance
I talked about?

We declare bankruptcy,
anything in your name
is at risk.

They go after you
personally, Joe.

It was
a good run, Joe.

I mean, they can't
take that away from us.

Well, excuse me
if I don't share
your sentimentality.

I already
called shuster.

I said it looked like
we'd be taking
their offer.

It's a decent
offer, Joe.

What? What, to buy us out
as a tax deduction?

Pennies
on the dollar?

We still got
kimball out in D.C.
lobbying for us.

He gets the Southern
tax incentive,

that's it.

We got it made, then.
Come on.

But we can't
count on that, Joe.

Besides, we got
a bird in the hand
with shuster.

Forget shuster.

We got to keep our eye
on the ball here, Lenny.

We step it up
with kimball.

We get the media
involved,

see if we get
a few more lobbyists

to jump
on the bandwagon.

Because once this thing
passes, Lenny,

we are the only game
in town.

You see how easy it is
to come up with
the negatives?

Huh?
You see that?

Solutions, my friend.

Yeah.

Come on now.
Solutions.

That's what I'm
looking for now, Lenny.

All right, pal.
All right.

(Telephone dial
clicking)

(Line rings)

Man: Hello.
Hey, Bobby.

Yeah,
it's Joe fine.

No, I'm good. Good.
How you doing?

Listen,
I need a favor.

TV reporter:
With the recession
in full force

and the jobless rate
continuing to escalate
along with inflation,

president Ford has turned
to his advisors for...

Maddie:
Daddy,

I could be starting
to like it here.

I made some
new friends
at school,

and I was
wondering...

Yeah, I'm just
trying to watch this.

Okay, but I just
was wondering

if maybe
this weekend...

I know. I just
can't hear this,
all right?

Can we please
take a few girls out
on the boat on Sunday?

Natalie:
How come we never
eat real vegetables,

only things from cans?

Joe:
You know what?
It's burnt.

Really, you know
I don't like when
it's burnt.

I'll get you
a can of tuna fish.

No, I don't want
no tuna fish.

Get me nothing.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

Even our fish
comes in cans.

Dad, I'm just really
trying to fit in here.

All right,
all right, just
what is it you want?

I told you. I want
to take a few girls out

on the boat Sunday
for a couple of hours.

Maybe it's not
such a bad idea.

Well, I'm playing
golf on Sunday,
okay, so forget it.

You guys both
want me to make
friends, right?

I don't understand.
We have this boat.

It's
the perfect way.

Enough with
the boat, okay?

Your father's
had a long day.

Mom, he's not even
listening to me.

Enough with
the goddamn boat!

All right?

I ever talked
to my father like that,

he'd put a strap
to me.

You're ungrateful.

All of you.

(Door closes)

You said
it was over, mom.

Joe:
I don't know how much
more of this I can stand.

Stella:
Of what?

(Joe speaks
indistinctly)

I mean, it's your fault.
You raised them

as loudmouthed,
spoiled little brats.

Natalie:
Every family
has its secrets.

For us,
it was my father's rage.

It plagued us
our entire lives,

and what was worse,

my mom
would take his side.

It was almost like
if she said anything
against him,

she'd wake up
and find herself

back in her hiding place
in Europe.

Her big job
was keeping dad,

the monster,
in his cave.

(Joe yelling)

I used to dream that I
was the reincarnation
of Anne Frank.

I mean,
what Jewish girl didn't?

How'd she do it,
anyway?

In spite of everything
she lived through,

she still thought
people were "good at heart."

(Light clattering)

I'm glad
we're all together.

Your father has
something he wants
to say to you.

Joe?

I know my behavior hasn't
been that great lately,

and I just want
to say that I have...

I've had
some work issues,

and they've been
getting to me,

and I apologize.

Okay, daddy.
We get it.

All right.
Ahem.

What is wrong
with you?

How can you just
forgive him like that?

Joe:
You know,
I've been thinking.

What do you say
we, like...

You know, we'll go
out to dinner tonight.

I'll take you all out
to dinner, like,
you know, a family,

like we used
to do.

I vote for Chinese.

I have plans.

Well, just cancel them.
That's easy enough, right?

Maddie, your father is
sorry for what he does.

You have to think of it
like a sickness.

What if he had cancer?

Mom, he doesn't
have cancer.

He is the cancer.

Don't you
ever say anything
like that again.

No matter what he
does, he is still
your father.

He's a great man.

Are we even living
under the same roof?

He takes care of us.

He protects us.

Joe:
Girls!

So you know what?

Listen, forget
what I just said.

Let's have
a nice barbecue
at the house tonight.

That would be nice.

All right.

Radio:
* you are my candy girl

* and you got me
wanting you *

* I just can't believe...

Natalie:
Some things never change.

Maddie worked on her tan
by the pool

waiting for the stud
in shining armor
to come back.

* ...Believe the wonder
of this feeling too *

* I just can't
believe it's true *

* ah, sugar...

Hey.
Hey, what's going on?

Natalie:
I sat in the shade

working on my poem
for the soup contest.

Teacher said
make it personal.

Dangerous.
It was very tempting.

* ah, honey

* ah, sugar, sugar

would any guy
ever look at me like that?

* you are
my candy... *

my poem sucks.

Oh, I'm sure
it's beautiful.

If only I could have
been born poverty-stricken
or survived a war

or overcame
some dreaded disease
at birth.

Bite your tongue.

I haven't suffered
nearly enough to be
a really good poet.

Poets don't
have to suffer.

Mom, the best writers
are tortured alcoholics,

and it's not like
I drink or anything.

Ah, that's good to know.

And what about
your sister?

I worry about her.

Are you going to invite
the new boyfriend
to dinner?

Ah, I haven't
thought about that.

Did you see
the jumbo cross?

Ah, well, we are
open-minded people.

You are?
Ah, yeah.

She's not going
to marry him.

Well, you'll be glad
to know that you're
still married

to a scratch golfer.

Where's maddie?
I don't know.

She's out at the pool
with her new boyfriend.


Wait. There's
a strange guy
in my pool?

He's nice too.

(Door opens)
(Laughter)

Daddy.
You're home early.

So this is
the guy that was
in the pool?

His name's Earl.
He was just leaving.

How you
doing, sir?

Earl. Great.

How you doing, sir?
He was just leaving.

Hey, Earl.
How you doing?

Very nice to meet you.
Good to meet you too, Earl.

Yeah, it's nice.
Why don't you
sit down?

I want
to talk to you.

No, no, no.
It's okay, yeah?

Sit down. Come on.
Stella: Joseph.

It's a little game
I like to play.

Come on.
It's all right.

Stay out of this,
Stella.

Don't worry about it.
Here.

What's the matter?
You can't take an old man?

Dad.
Joseph.

It's all right.
Relax. Relax, maddie.

Now, I warn you,
I do 100 push-ups
every day, you know.

He's just playing.

Mind your business now,
please, all right?

It's all right.
It's all right.

Now just look
in my eyes.

Look me in the eyes.
Ready?

1, 2, 3.

Hey, you will
never disrespect
my daughter, right?

Dad!
Of course not.

You're never going
to offend me, right?

No, sir.
Say it.

"I will never..."
I will never...

"Disrespect..."

Disrespect...
Dad!

Me.
You.

All right.
That's not bad,

but I think
the guys in Brooklyn

would have put up
a better fight.

Are you
serious, sir?

I'm so sorry.
Come on.

I'm so sorry.

Joseph.

What?

Why would you do
a thing like that
to your own daughter?

Huh? She's finally
happy here,

and boyfriends are
gonna come and go.

Yeah, well, this one
better go fast.

You see that earring
in his ear?

I mean, come on.

And that cross
around his neck?
It's big as my fist.

Come on. I mean,

I'm protecting her,
okay?

I'm protecting her.

Is he always
like that?

You don't even
want to know.

So I'll see you
on Monday?

You bet.

Natalie:
It was the weekend,

and I was still
stuck on my poem,

which I hated
more than ever.

Anyone who wanted to be
in the contest and win $500

had to submit
their first draft
the following week.

(Knock on door)

Maddie.
Hmm?

Hey, come on.
We're going
on a day trip.

Oh, my God.
Put on something nice.

You guys sleep
half the day away.
Let's go. Come on.

Natalie:
I was at war
with imperfection.

I hated everything
I wrote.

It was a war
with imperfection.

A tug of war
with imperfection.

You know what?
That's not bad.

Natalie, come on.
Let's go.

But I have to present
my poem Monday.

Natalie, come on.
All work and no play
is not good.

We got to go.

Where do you think
he's taking us?

Girls, let's
get moving.

Please tell us
what's going on.

I'm not going to
tell you where
we're going,

but I'll show
you how we're
getting there.

Come here.

(Laughs)
Joe: Look at that.

Maddie:
I call shotgun.

Joe:
Is that beautiful or what?
We are going in style.

Where did you get
the rolls, dad?

My own driver Sam
hooked me up.

Just be ready.
Five minutes.
Come on, let's go.

Evening, Mr. fine.

Hey, thanks for
making this night
so special, Sam.

Oh, you're welcome, sir.

The girls will be
down in a minute.

Okay.

It's so amazing.

This is
so exciting.

Ah. Ladies, meet Sam.

Evening, ladies.

Hey.
Where are we going?

Well, let's put it
this way.

The guy's
a musical legend.

When he sings,
the girls go crazy,

and he dances up
a storm.

(Girls gasp)

Natalie:
I can't believe it.

I've been waiting
forever to see him.

Maddie:
Oh, my gosh.

Could you
contain yourself?

Maddie, I can't believe
we're going to see him.

Woman: I'm so excited.
I know. It's amazing.

Natalie:
I am so excited.

All right.

Sam, why don't
you come inside
to see the show?

That's a pretty
exclusive club,
sir.

Listen,
you're a negro.
I'm a Jew.

It's not like they're
going to be happy to see
either one of us.

It's about time
us bottom-feeders

move up the food chain.
Come on.

This is
going to be a night
you'll never forget.

That's what
I'm afraid of.

(Both laugh)

Man:
What's taking them
so long?


Look at the line.

Poor bastards
probably been
here all night.

Follow me.

Joe fine, party of four,
with a guest.

Oh, Mr. fine.
Pleasure to meet you.

You're
on our v.I.P. List.

Right this way, sir.
V.I.P. List?


I'm telling you
this is going
to be some show.

Look at this.
Is this place
something or what?

Sam:
This is something else.

Your private box,
Mr. fine.

All right.
Look at this.

Wow. Dad!

Oh, my gosh.
All right.

Whoa.

This is
the good life.

Joe:
Can't get better
seats than this.

They're never going
to forget this.

You know what, honey?
Why don't you order
a couple of Martinis

and get the girls
some Shirley temples?

And, Sam, you get
something too, okay?

Okay,
thank you, sir.

Where are you going?
I got a meeting

to go to. I'll be back
before the main event.

Don't worry.
A meeting with who?

Sam, you take care
of the girls, all right?

Sure thing,
Mr. fine.

(Knocking on door)

I'm here
to see Bobby.

Hey, is
this really
a body shop,

or is this just
your cover here?

I got a Cadillac,

you know, could use
a little tlc.

Maybe you guys could
look at it sometime.

Hey, hey, hey, Joe fine.
Glad you could make it.

Hey, Bob.
How are you?

Doesn't say much,
does he?

He's got
other qualities.
Follow me.

Yeah. I bet.

(Audience murmuring)

(Audience cheering)

Where's dad? The show
is about to start.

Something's
wrong.

Nothing is wrong,
damn it.

Why don't I go out
and take a look
around for him?

Oh, no,
no, just sit down.

Sit down.

Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

the roxy is proud
to present the king
of rock 'n' roll!


(Dice rattle)
Let's go. Let's go.

You got them tickets
I sent you, right?

Yeah. You really
came through for me
big time, Bobby.

The kids
are in heaven.

Well, that's a good thing,
right?

Okay, have a seat
right here, Joe.

I'm going to see
if the big guy
is ready for you.

Take care
of my boy.

You give him
anything he wants.
I'm buying.

Give me
a scotch, neat.

* oh, my God

* can you see

* that I've got a chick
that's into me? *

* she wanna do it

* yeah

* she wanna do it, uh-huh

* she wanna do it...

(Overlapping
conversations)

Bobby:
Hey, Joe.

Battelli is ready
to see you now.

Thanks for making
the introduction,
Bobby.

I'm always here for you.
You know that.

All right.

No sense in wasting
a good drink.

* she was
a real wild child *

* she wanted
to do it, yeah *

* she wanted to do it,
oh, yeah *

* she wanted to do it

* do it night and day.

Natalie:
My dad missed
the whole show.

Where the hell was he?

Oh, thank God.
Hey.

Natalie:
He took so long

that I finished my poem
and fell asleep.

Where are the kids?
They're up?

We were
worried sick.

You missed him,
daddy.

He was fatter
than I thought
he'd be.

Listen, Sam,

thanks for
taking care of
the girls, all right?

Why don't you go
get the car, pull it
out in front?

Sure thing.
All right.

What were you
doing?

What was I doing?

This is what I was
doing, right here.

Where did you
get that?

Never mind where I got it.
The night is young.

Come on,
let's go party more.

Come on, let's go.

All right,
come on, girls.
Here we go.

Natalie:
It wasn't until later

that I realized
we'd been bought off.


I haven't
seen you this happy
in such a long time.

Ah, what's there
not to be happy
about, right?

New home,

new life.
It's great.

You know, I got
something for you.

Oh, no. What more
could you get me? No.

I got something
for you.

I didn't get
a chance to buy you
an engagement ring

when we first
got married.

Mm, you got me one
a few years later.

But it... that was
not even a carat.

Come on, baby.
That was like a token.

Here.
Oh, no, Joseph.

This is
an engagement ring.

Here. Give me...

Oh, my God.

It's huge.

(Both laugh)

Oh, God.

Are you sure
we can afford this?

Of course
we can afford it.

I worked
my whole life
for this, okay?


You let me do this
for you, okay?

I love you,
Stella.

I love you.
You hear me?

I love you.

Hey.

Hey, hey,
get over here.

Come here.
How are you?

What's the news?
You fly me down here
on a Saturday,

it must be something
pretty big.

Oh, this is big.

Something
to celebrate.

Cubans,
your favorite.

Go ahead.

Thanks. You going
to tell me what
we're celebrating?

Let's take
a walk.

What would you say
if I told you that we
have enough money

to keep us solvent
for the next
eight months?

I'd ask you
what bank you robbed.

I got a loan.

A bank loan?
"Bank loan." Come on.

Had a 10-year relationship
with Manny hanning.

The first sign
of trouble, they stop
returning my calls.


So where'd you get
the loan, Joe?

I got it.

Who are
these guys?

Is it a mob loan?


Ah, Jesus, Joe.

We always steered clear
of those ganefs.

Besides, we got
a decent offer
from shuster.

The guy's chomping
at the bit.

Come on. Come on.
Don't embarrass me

with his lowball offer,
okay?

You're playing
with fire, Joe.

Look, plans are
coming together
down in D.C.

Come on. As soon
as the legislation votes
on the Southern tax trade,

we're home free.

And what if
it doesn't?

Come on. You think
I got where I have

without taking
some prudent risks?

Prudent?
We've both seen what
those people could do.

You forgot
Bernie weinstein,
that poor bastard, huh?

They broke his legs
for a deuce.

The guy still
walks around
with a limp.

Weinstein was
a smug son of a bitch.

I don't know anybody
who wasn't happy

the day he got
his legs broke, okay?

Joe, listen to me.

30 years
you kept a roof over
my family's head,

what we ate.
You educated
my people.

I tell you this
with all due respect.

I think you're
kidding yourself.

I'm kidding myself?

If I don't tell you,
who would?

You know what, Lenny?
You're right.

20 years, I been
carrying you on my back.

You always been
a taker

and, right now,
a little bit of a coward.

Ah...

Look, I know
you don't mean that.

Look, we both got
a family, Joe.

Think of your girls.

I'm doing it for my girls,
you horse's ass!

Joe, listen to me.

No, you listen
to me.

You know what?
Just get the fuck out.

Really.
Just get the fuck out

before I do something
I don't want to do.

Natalie:
When it rains,

it really pours
in Louisiana.

After buddy's back legs
gave out...

Don't worry, buddy.

This is like
the best vet
in the whole South.

I insisted my parents
take him to a specialist.

(Thunder rumbling)

All right, well...

How much time
do I got

before he can't
even walk again?

You know, give me
a ballpark figure.

There really is
no way to tell
for sure.

Well, what are
the options?

Well,
he is suffering

and in some pain.

We could
put him down now,

or you could
take him home

and I could
give him something.

But either way,
I suggest you
think about it.

(Buddy whimpers)

Well, I thought
about it.

I think we should
put him down.

Daddy, please!

You think he wants
to be remembered
like this, huh? Sick?

No, you can't!

Mom?!

Let's just
think about it.

We don't have
to decide today.

Look, could you just
back me up sometimes

so I don't have
to be the bad guy
all the time?

Just give us a minute
to say goodbye, doc,
all right?

No. Please, daddy.
Please.

It's for
his own damn good.

And what about
maddie?

She won't even
get a chance
to say goodbye.

No, you can't.

You can't do this.
I won't let you. No.

Stop the hysteria,
or I'm going to tell you
to wait in the fucking car.


You had to see him.

He would never
have been able
to bring buddy back.

We had
to do it then.

Bullshit.
He does what he wants.

He doesn't care
what anybody else thinks.

Why are you lying
for him, Natalie?

Tell me the truth.
I'm your sister.

I tried
to stop him,

but you know
how nuts he gets,

and I'm not as brave
as you are.

Natalie:
When I finally had
to present my poem,

I couldn't do it.

What had seemed
like genius to me

was now gibberish.

Natalie?

I hated myself.

I hated him.

I hated anyone
who ever dared to rhyme.

I can't.

Natalie:
My mom would say,

"time heals all wounds."

She taught us to believe
in any rosy cliche

where we could
fill in the blanks.

In this case,

time meant
the two-week period

leading up
to maddie's birthday.

(Shutter clicks)

Happy Birthday!

Stella: Happy Birthday!
All right.

Are you ready
for your present?

Yeah.

Happy Birthday.

No, it's yours.

Oh, my gosh!

It's all
yours, honey.
You deserve it.

Daddy,
thank you so much.

Mama, thank you.

Only the best
for my girl.

Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

Okay, all right,
here's the lights
right here.

Mm-hmm.
All right. You watching?

I'm watching.
Okay. All right.

All right.
Here's the air.

Okay.
You got to just move that.

And here's
the eight-track,

but, please, no music
while you're driving, okay?

Okay, daddy.
All right.

All right,
here we go.

Okay.
Let's go.

(Engine grinds)
Start it?

Yes. Go ahead.
(Engine starts)

That's it.

Good. Good.
Very good.

Just go straight.
You like this car, huh?

I love it.
All right.

Just keep
going straight.

That's it.
Okay.

All right, easy,
easy, easy on the gas.

Okay, daddy.

I passed
my driver's test,
you know.

Yes, I know.
That doesn't make you
a driver, bud, okay?

All right, you got
to take it easy now.

All right.
All right, slow...

All right,
we're going to... whoa.

Just... easy!

(Tires squeal)

What are you doing?

I-I'm sorry.

I know, but what
are you doing?

I'm sorry, dad.

All right, you're sorry.
Joe, please.

Sorry's not
good enough.

Can we just
go home?

You got to be
careful.

People can
get hurt here.

I know.
All right.

(Tires squeal)
All right, listen to me.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?!

Stella: Joe. Joseph.
Huh?!

Dad, you know what?

I don't even
want your car.

Wait a minute!

Quitter.

What?

You're a quitter
and an ingrate.

Asshole.

What'd you
just call me?

I called you
a fucking asshole.

(Stella screams)

Joseph!

Stella:
My God.

Natalie:
Maddie!

Maddie. Maddie,
are you okay?

Stella:
Maddie. Maddie!


I'm fine.

Stop it.

(Engine roars)

(Door closes)

(Door opens)

You need to see
someone.

I'm not talking
to no headshrinker.

Are you crazy?

There are people that
can help you with this.

You know,
just the doctors.

No, no doctors.
What am I going to say
to a doctor? Come on.

I want to talk
to someone,
I talk to you.

Talk to me.
Talk to me.

I talk to you.

Remember I told you
that I got this scar

because I fell
and I hit a glass table?

Well, that was
like half the truth.

I was 15, Stella,
15 years old.

I was a young man.

I had a toothache,
you know.

It was really bad.

I kept telling
my father to take me
to the dentist,

and he said,
"hey, tough it out.
Be a man."

"It's good for you."

So I tried,
you know.

One night,
I couldn't take
the pain anymore.

So I guess I asked
him too many times
to take me.

He turned around.
He punched me
in the face,

knocked me out.

I fell into
the glass table.

40 stitches later,

I woke up
in the hospital,
you know.

I felt all right,
you know?

I got
my tooth fixed.

That's how I got
this scar, Stella.

That's the truth.

It's a beautiful scar.

Yeah, it's beautiful.

I don't mind it.

'Cause every time
I look in the mirror,

it makes me
realize how much
I fucking hate him.

He got
his wish.

He made me tough,
all right.

I'm going to make you
an appointment
with Dr. tessler.

Baby, I don't know.

Yes, he is
a good man.

You can talk to him.
He can help you, Joseph.

I don't know.

Please. Please,
I'm begging you.

Do it for me.
I love you so much.

Please, Joseph.

Please.

All right.

Thank you.

Natalie:
So we took a trip
to Baton Rouge

to see my dad's
old doctor,

who had semiretired there
three years earlier.

Finally dad was
going to get some help.

This is the moment
we had been praying for.

Don't we get input
with Dr. tessler?

We thought
we'd get to talk
to him a little.

I told you I talked
to the doctor.

All right.

Pressure
is normal.

All right.

So Stella tells me
that you're under
quite a bit of stress.

She sounded
very concerned.

Yeah, well,
Stella overreacts
about everything, doc.

Oh, to me,

she sounded like
she was a concerned wife.

Well...

You know,
there are medications
for this sort of a thing.

No. Doc, I'm not
taking no medication.

I'm fine.
You know, I mean,

she's very, like,
anxious, nervous.
You know what I mean.

I mean...
Really?

Yeah. One time,
I had heartburn,
you know.

She thought
I was having
a heart attack.

She called 911.

Really? I didn't know
she was that anxious.

Ah, that's my wife,
doc.

So you think
that this...

Fear she has
about your anger

is just
an exaggeration?

Absolutely.

I mean, look,
am I... I get
angry sometimes?

Do I got a temper?
Yeah,

but no different
than any other guy

who's got,
like, you know,
stress at work.

I mean,
she overreacts, doc.

I mean, you know
she was a holocaust
survivor, right?

Yeah, I know that.

Yeah. Well, this woman
went through a lot.

I'm telling you.
I mean, she...

You know, Christian
friends of her family,

they hid her in a hole
in the ground

during the day
for two years.

That's incredible.

You're telling me,
doc.

So do you think this is
what this is all about?

Oh, absolutely, doc.

I mean,
you don't understand.
I'm her whole world.

When I met her,
she couldn't even speak
a word of English.

She had nothing.
I mean, you know,

I gave her a life that's
like a fairytale land.

I'm fine,
doc, really.

Right?
I'm fine, right?
Come on.

(Both chuckle)

Dr. tessler:
Stella, girls,

you'll be happy
to hear that Joe

is as healthy
as a man half his age,

fit as a fiddle,
no sign of depression

or anything else
that concerns me.

That's wonderful.

What'd I tell you?

Joe: Thanks, doc.
You're welcome.

Joe:
You guys ready?

Natalie: Doctor was wrong.
Let's go.

Everything was not fine.

My father had so many
plates spinning in the air

that one of them
was bound to crash.

It was the law
of gravity.

Right.
Oh, kimball.

Kimball,
listen to me,
all right?

Are you telling me
there's not a chance

that this legislation's
going to pass now?

What?

With all your
political muscle,

you can't get
a bill passed

that's
a fucking win-win
for this country?

Do they know
how many jobs

they're flushing
down the toilet here?

If all
the manufacturing
goes overseas,

we're going to have
nothing left here.

Forget it. Forget it.

(Handset rings)

Where are you
going?

I got to take care
of something at work.

Don't wait up for me,
all right?

Joe:
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

That legislation was
going to save my ass.

I'm out of options.

You think
I want to burn
my factory down?

You know
what we call that?

No offense... we call it
"Jewish lightning."

You know, excuse
the expression.

I got just the guy
for you.

I just don't want
anybody getting hurt.

Ah, nobody's
going to get hurt.

Boy's a pro,
tops in his field.

(Balls clatter)

Do it.

(Balls clatter)

Joe:
Hey, pumpkin.

I was looking
through my files,

and I found
these photos.

You have
to see them.

Dad, I'm working
on my poem.

Oh, come on.
You work too hard.

Take a break, huh?

No, you have
to see this.
This is your mother,

your mother
when we were dating.

Will you
look at this?

Come here.
Look at that.

Come here.

Sit down.

That's your mom.

Whoa. She looks
amazing.

Yeah, she does.

Most beautiful
woman I ever met.

That's all right, huh?
Look at her.

Look at this one.

That's your
grandmother,
my mom.

You look
a little like her.

Do you have
any pictures of grandpa?

No. No, I had some.

I don't know
what happened to 'em.

Hey, you know what?
I forgot

why I came in here
in the first place.

Here. Now I want you
to take this,

and I want you to put it
in a safe place,
all right?

What is it?

It's information.

What kind
of information?

Well, you know,
if something ever
happens to me,

you know,
you and your sister got
to take care of your mom.

You're both old enough now
to understand.

There's, like,
vault combinations,
insurance policies,

where the money is.

Listen. Hey,
things happen
in life, okay?

Just put it
in a safe spot,
all right?

This is too weird.


I'll put it in here.

Let me
tell you something,

and I'm
not telling you this
because I'm your father.

You are remarkable.

Thanks, daddy.

You know,
I think this is
the first time

that we've
ever talked
like this,

me and you.

You're kidding.

Come here.

Man:
Hello?

Lenny. Yeah, hi.
It's Joe.

Joe, it's been
on my mind...

Yeah. I know.
Hey, listen, we both
got crazy, right?

It's all right.
Forget it.

Look, I was wondering
if you could still
do me a favor.

What do you
need, Joe?

Yeah, well,
could you call shuster?

And if it's
still available,

I'd like to take
his offer.

Tell him we
can make a deal here,
all right?

Well, sure.
Absolutely.
Joey, look...

Forget it. Come on.
We both got nuts. It's...

Come on. 30 years
we're together.

What are we going to do,
throw it away?

Ah, never us, Joe.
All right. All right, thanks.

Radio:
* hey, hey

* all right

* get it
from the main line *

* all right

* I said
a-find it, find it *

* darling, love it

* if you like it

* yeah

* hey, hey

* it's your business...

Come on, man. Let's get
this party started, huh?

Whoo!

* get it together, baby

* come and get your love...
Whoo!

(Laughter)
Whoo!

Yeah!
Oh, my God.

Boy:
Louie! Louie!

* come and get your love...
Louie!

Maddie:
Who invited them?

* come and get
your love... *

excuse me.

(Whistling)
Whoo-hoo!

Girl:
Go, guys.

(Laughter, whistling)

Get out of my pool!

Come on.
We're just having fun.

Get out of my pool.

Welcome to the party.
Get out of my pool now!

Get out!

(Car approaches)

(Car door closes)

Hey, Joe.
Hey.

Ah, I thought you were
working late.

You all right?

Yeah, no, I had
one of those days,
you know?

I just wanted
to come home to see

you and the kids,
you know?

Where are
the girls?

They're in back
at the pool.

Maddie's got
some friends over.

Really?
Yeah.

How many friends?

Ah, just a few
nice kids.

Mom!
What's going on?

Oh, they're just
having fun.

Yeah. Except,
I think,

maybe one of them
forgot their bathing suit.

Somebody's
in my pool with
no clothes on?

Um...

Just wait there.
Just don't...

Son of a bitch.
Joe, they're just kids.

Kids got no respect.
Joseph, listen.

Natalie: Mom?
What are you doing?

Never mind.
What is it?

No, what are you
do...

Oh, my God. No, Joe.
Dad!

Listen, I'm only
going to scare them.

Just relax.
Everybody relax.

He's not going
to shoot them,
is he?

Just relax, okay!
Mom?

Oh, my God.
No.

* baby, hey, oh

* hey, all right

* get it
from the main vine... *

all right! I'm going
to say this once
and only once!

Jesus Christ.
Your dad's fricking crazy!

I want you to pick up
your things,

put on your clothes,

and get off
my property now,

or I'm going
to start shooting!

Daddy!
One!

Two!
Jesus Christ.

Three!
He's not gonna shoot anybody.

Four!
Get out of here, Louie!

Five!
Leave!

Oh, shit.
Six!

Get out of here, Louie!
Leave!

Seven!
Just go!

Eight!
Get out!

Nine!
Earl: Holy jeez.

You crazy kike!
Get out!

10!
Louie!

Earl:
Get out of here!

(Kids screaming)

Move!
(Gunshot)

He has a gun, maddie.
Just go, please.

That's right!
Run!

Run, you son
of a bitches!

Dad!
Maddie.

Boy:
I can't believe that.

Shoot me!

Shoot me.
You've ruined
my life!

You might as well
shoot me!

What the hell are
you talking about?

You threatened
all of my new friends

with a gun, dad!

You're sick.

You need help, dad.

(Maddie sobbing)

They just said
there's going to be
a storm tonight.

Isn't it
hurricane season?

Maybe you should just
hold off on all this
till tomorrow.

(Car radio
playing rock music)

* the sound
of your footsteps... *

it's too late for that.
He's here.

Come with me.

* your soft,
gentle motion, baby... *

come with me.
I can't.

* in my midnight
confession *

* when I tell all the world
that I love you *

* in my midnight
confession *

* when I say all the things
that I want to... *

hey.
Hi.

Natalie:
Maddie had somewhere to go.

She was smarter
than I thought.

In fact, she was
a lot smarter than me,

'cause I didn't have
an escape plan.

I was stuck.

(Line rings)

Yeah?
Bobby.

Yeah, it's Joe fine.
Hey, Joe.

Yeah, no.
I'm good. I'm good.
How you doing? Yeah.

Listen, that thing
we talked about...

You know,
about hiring that kid?

Jewish lightning.
Yeah, right. Yeah.

Yeah,
the Jewish lightning.

Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. Forget it.

Cancel the whole thing.

What?
No, let's just say

I had a moment of clarity,
all right? Yeah.

Yeah, well,
on my end,
battelli...

What about battelli?

Listen, you tell him
I'm a man of my word.

All right,
he's going to get paid.

Bobby, you think
that scares me?

You have no idea
right now.

You think that
scares me, Bobby? Huh?

You tell him to do
what he's got to do.

I'll put him
in my goddamn will,
all right?!

(Handset slams)

I was thinking
maybe this weekend

we could picnic
over by the lake

or, you know,
out by...

Sounds fun.

Hey, man.
What the hell
you doing?

Sorry, bro.
This your car?

Yes. What the hell
you doing sitting on it?

Hey, look,
I wasn't sitting.
I was leaning.

You was leaning?
Don't get smart
with me, boy.

I don't want no trouble.
He didn't do anything.

He was thinking
about stealing it,

wasn't you,
you fucking nigger?

Stop it!
He didn't do
anything.

Maddie!
Stop!

Maddie, look,
down here,

women don't tell men
what to do, okay?

Maddie. Maddie!

Maddie,
where are you going?

Don't touch me.

Where are you
going?!

I want to help you.

But I'm scared
of you.


You're not
scared of me.

You love me.

Come on, Stella.

Come here.
No more. No.

Natalie:
What's going on?

Just let me talk
to your father.

Tell her to go away,
all right?

Just tell her...
Let's go upstairs.

Let's go upstairs,
baby. Come on.

I want to go
upstairs.

Just listen to me.
Listen.

Now you go over there,
and you tell them

to get the fuck
upstairs. You hear me?

Get 'em out of here.
Don't you see

what you're doing
to your children?

Tell them to get
the fuck out of here!

Don't you
touch her!

(Thunder rumbling)

Do you know
what's going on here?

Everything's
turning to shit!

When are you going
to get it through
your thick skulls

that I hate
my fucking life?

(Insects chirping)

(Gunshot pops)

(Women screaming)
Daddy!

Daddy!
Daddy!

Daddy!
Dad!


(Dog barking)

Are you okay?

I hate you.

Why don't you
try to stop him?

Does someone
in this family

Have to kill themselves

before you can
finally see what's
been going on here?

Because the truth is,
I've thought about it,
mama.

(Alarm, sirens blaring)

What's going on?

Who turned on
the alarm?

I did.

By accident?
No, not an accident.

We're in trouble.

What the hell
are you talking about?

What's happening?
What's going on?

What the hell
is the matter
with you, Stella?

You call the cops
right now, and you tell
them it was a mistake.

No, it's not
a mistake.

Everybody, get upstairs.
It's fine, okay?

It's okay.

(Police siren wailing)

(Radio dispatch
chatter)

What the hell
is wrong with you?

(Police
bang on door)

Please, come in.

He's terrorizing us.

It's my husband.
He's got a gun.

He tried to kill himself.
Sir. Sir.

No, no, no.
Calm down.

It was a mistake.
Calm down, sir.

Officer, no, no.
Just calm down.

It was a mistake.
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

Calm down.
It was a mistake.

What are you doing?
Natalie: No.

Don't cuff me,
not in front of my kids.

Stella, would you
tell them this
is my house?

Stella, tell 'em!

No, Joe.
It's my house.

(Siren continues)

(Sobbing)
It's okay.

Okay.

(Siren, alarm fade)

Natalie:
My mother never spoke to us

about what she had done.

But incredibly,

she had done it.

And our home was quiet.

It was more than quiet.
It was peaceful.

Look what came
in the mail today.

It's the poetry
contest people.

What? How is that
even possible?

I was disqualified.

You open it.

Oh, my God.

You're a finalist.

What? Really?
I am?


This is
unbelievable.

I'm so proud
of you.

Natalie:
We were finally ready
to slow down...

stop running.

This is
so exciting.

I'm betting
on Natalie to win.

But you'll
still love me
even if I place?

Oh, even if you
show and throw up
on the judge...

Judge:
It gives me great pleasure

to announce
the first-place winner

of the sixth annual
Louisiana state.

Campbell's soup
poetry competition,

Natalie Elizabeth fine.

(Applause, cheering)

You can do it.

Congratulations,
Natalie.

Here's the $500
prize money.

Natalie, would you
do us the honor

of reading your poem,
"mighty fine"?

Go ahead.

"Little boy's devil..."

now devil's man.

Still running
from where he ran.

Still hiding
when he can.

Though my parents once said

that the monster
was dead,

there's been
a recent resurrection.

A blister on sanity's
bright complexion.

A tug of war
with imperfection

in this temple
of emotion,

where he stirred
so much commotion.

There's a monster
in dad,

and it makes him
wicked mad.

Is there a cure
in dad's devotion...

or in a child's
whispered pleas?

Tame the monster
in dad,

take his fits,
all that's bad...

"and save
one mighty fine family."


Natalie:
That's the way
I wish it had been.

My dad never made it
to the contest,

but he finally
got some help.

And his hospital stay
saved all of our lives.

As his anger faded,

my courage grew,

and we met up
somewhere in the middle.

Okay, so I wasn't
Anne Frank.

But I was me,

and that was enough.

Eventually we found
each other again...

and that was enough.
