Aah!

Girl, quiet.

You'll wake up the dead.

It was a nightmare.

Enough about nightmares.

You've got to be on your way

before the house is 
 up for breakfast.

Look alive, girl.

You'll never be hired 
 looking cow-eyed.

I write this note.

I told your mother 
 I'd do what I could,

and now I done it.

Put your hat over your face.

Your mug's been in the papers.

You can't tell them the truth,

or they'll send you packing.

and God hates a liar,

so just keep your mouth shut. 
 You hear me?

Keep your mouth shut.

Well, hurry now.

Go on.

Can't you talk?

Oh, Lorraine,

of course she can talk.

Will you let me eat sweets?

Lorraine.

She gets far too 
 many sweets as it is.

Her father cannot say no.

Will you paint with me 
 and read me stories?

Of course she will, 
 won't you, Alice?

Oh, yes, ma'am.

Has Trevor got one of 
 his famous smiles for Alice?

LORRAINE: Our nanny 
 walked out on us.

Well, not quite,

but she did leave us in a pickle.

We need to find a 
 replacement quickly.

We're going on a big boat!

That's right, dear.

Tomorrow we get on a 
 big boat for New York.

Would you like Alice 
 to come with us?

I don't know.

Well, of course you do.

What about you, Trevor?

Do you like Alice? Hmm?

Maybe you should hold him.

I'd like him to get used to you

before we sail.

You're supposed 
 to hold his head.

Uh, the note said

that you've had 
 experience with babies.

I mean, that's imperative.

Oh, yes, ma'am. 
 I got experience.

I love children.

I-- It's just nervous, that's all.

Ohh, well, there's no need 
 to be nervous around us.

We're just regular people.

The most important thing

is that you give our 
 children loving care.

Oh, my heavens, what 
 a lucky girl you are.

You'll be sailing on the Titanic.

Is the crew in order?

Aye, it's a fine bunch, sir.

I know quite a few of them.

Most come from the same 
 neighbourhood here in southampton,

but these 900 men never 
 sailed together as a crew before,

so there's a bit of confusion.

Still, all in all, they're as proud 
 a bunch as I've ever seen.

Indeed, to serve 
 aboard this vessel.

Uh, also, Captain, well, 
 to serve under you.

Well, thank you, Mr. Lowe.

There's always a bit of 
 apprehension on a maiden voyage,

but I have the greatest faith

in all of my officers and men,

including yourself, sir.

Now I'm afraid I must face

the most perilous 
 part of the voyage--

meeting all of those reporters.

We have here the largest movable 
 manmade structure in the world.

A supership, if you will.

11 stories high. 
 5 city blocks long.

A boat this big, it has to 
 be slower than Lusitania.

Does the Lusitania 
 have a library,

a swimming pool, 
 turkish baths?

We're offering luxury. 
 A colossal showcase.

And I can assure you, young man,

that this ship will give the 
 Lusitania a run for her money.

Is it your vision, Mr. Ismay, 
 or the owner's?

Well, in all fairness 
 to J.P. Morgan,

may I remind you that my father 
 founded the white star line.

Now, I, as managing director,

intend to bring it 
 into the 20th century.

Ah, here he is our Captain.

Captain Smith, is it true 
 you're retiring after this voyage?

That's true.

Will you be writing a book 
 about your adventures?

Well, it'd be a very 
 short book, I'm afraid.

I haven't had much adventure.

What about wrecks, accidents?

Well, there've been winter squalls

and storms and fog,

but I've never had any... 
 adventure worth writing about,

certainly not recording 
 for posterity.

I'm afraid that I enjoy 
 uneventful sea voyages.

Like the one you're 
 embarking on, sir?

Exactly.

Shipbuilding has become 
 such an art now

that disaster is...

unthinkable.

My job has become, um...

Uh, effortless.

Thank you.

Effortless.

Gentlemen, might I point 
 out the dining room.

Oh, yes, please.

For your information,

we are stocked with 
 75,000 pounds of fresh meat...

11,000 pounds of fresh fish...

and 1,120 pounds of 
 marmalades and jams.

And of course,

stock of the finest libations.

Cognac-- oh, one moment.

Yes, "Sandeman Port, 1870."

Very good.

Thank you.

And we have-- uh, not there!

Those chairs should go

on the private promenade outside.

Uh, they should be a darker green.

They will be repainted 
 before the next sailing,

you can be sure of that.

We have seen to every detail.

What about lifeboats?

We have complied 
 with the statutes

of the british board of trade.

But, gentlemen, we 
 have here the largest,

most beautiful, and 
 technically perfect ship

in the history of mankind.

We're not going 
 to need lifeboats.

I thank you for your attention,

now first Officer Murdock here

will take you on a 
 short tour of the bridge.

Good day to you.

Good day. Thank you. 
 - This way, gentlemen.

[ police whistle blowing ]

Oh! Aah!

Bugger!

[ blowing whistle ]

[ ragtime piano music ]

[ loud conversations ]

Tot of rum here, mate.

Here, take me cap, lad.

Keep your head in your booze

and your wits about you.

[ exhales ]

You in trouble, lad?

Nothing serious, thank you.

Ahem.

Drinks on me, chaps.

Here.

Here.

I worked for this.

Worked and saved.

Say farewell to 
 bloomin' England.

I'm set for Niagara Falls.

That's in America.

You see her out there?

See who?

The Titanic.

Biggest ship ever made.

Just walk right outside 
 that door there.

Here, look at this.

See that?

[ chuckles ]

That's...

that's me ticket 
 to a new life, eh?

No more coal dust 
 for Merriam Dickle.

America!

On the biggest ship 
 I've ever dreamed.

Imagine, Merriam Dickie...

sailing with some of the 
 richest people in the world.

Ha ha ha ha!

[ chuckles ]

Well, you're right about that.

John Jacob Astor himself 
 wil be on that boat.

That's a fact.

All the money and jewels on board.

Priceless paintings.

A thief could have himself

a high old time.

Did you ever see 
 a diamond tiara?

Can't say I have.

Of course, the trick is

getting the booty off the boat.

Strings of pearls.

Oh, yes, sir.

A thief could have himself

a grand old time.

Mmm.

I'll be calling it a day.

Man's got to get his sleep.

OK, but I owe you one.

No. Just the tiara.

You be careful.

Hey. Heh.

Merriam Dickie...

on the same ship

as John Jacob Astor.

[ laughing ]

That's the joke on it, eh, lad?

Here...

to-- to the Titanic!

Titanic.

Ha ha.

# ...beyond joy #

# The queen and king #

# Me mother nor me father #

# Won't I have a 
 clue where I'll be #

# Across the sea... #

Come on, Dickie.

You can't sleep here, 
 now, can you?

Aye, my brother 
 has got me a job,

a whole new life

for Merriam Dickie. Yes. Yes.

Wake up.

I'll take you back to 
 your boardinghouse.

[ snoring ]

Dickie.

Dickie.

[ carriage passing ]

Titanic.

And my thanks it is 
 to you, Mr. Dickie.

Maybe I'll say good-bye to 
 bloomin' England myself.

Nigal...

Yes, sir?

Get the bags.

Yes, sir.

Bye!

...or ye shall die, sinners!

Repend of your wickedness!

Repend or ye shall die, sinners!

Repend of your wickedness!

I hear shrieks

and cries

and moaning!

You shall sink in the dark waters

and never be heard of again!

Mrs. Paradine.

Isabella.

We're both going on the Titanic.

It must be fate.

I don't believe in fate...

Mr. Park.

Please excuse me.

And death shall cover thee!

Thou shal sink deep in the ocean

like a stone!

Yes, Miss?

Ludwigsen.

Ludwigsen.

A lovely little lady 
 traveling alone, are you?

Uh, she's a convert 
 traveling with the group.

My husband here is 
 Black Billy Jack,

and he's big enough to take 
 you on, and a few more like you,

so don't go bullying us 
 because of our religion.

We're no simps.

Now, Clarinda.

Uh, I be a Blacksmith, sir.

That's where my 
 nickname comes from.

Not from my nature.

Excuse me, I'm looking 
 for the men's quarters.

Well, look what 
 the cat dragged in.

I don't think I caught 
 your name, chum.

Ahem.

Merriam Dickie.

Dickie, you say?

Heh heh heh heh.

Well, Mr. Dickie,

I don't suppose you'll be 
 traveling with these converts.

No, I'm traveling alone.

Well, run along, then, chum.

I'll catch up with you later.

Miss Ludwigsen, 
 if you'll step this way.

The Steward down the corridor

will give you a cabin, 
 Mr. and Mrs. Jack...

All the little... Jacks.

I'm told we'll have crisp nights

but clear skies straight across--

why, Mr. Park.

Henry! Good to see you, Henry.

Well, likewise, I'm sure, sir.

You will see many familiar faces.

Many of the regulars 
 have joined us, sir.

Mr. Wynn Park across 
 the hall from you--

real gentleman.

I have crossed the 
 Atlantic 6 times with him.

Generous man, if you 
 know what I mean.

I must ask for another stateroom.

Mrs. Paradine, this one is exquisite.

Every detail--

Please see what 
 you can arrange.

Mrs. Paradine,

everything is booked solid.

It's impossible. 
 I can't stay here.

Please.

Any room at all.

Just far from this one.

Yes, of course. Ahem.

Thank you.

[ horn blowing ]

[ cheering ]

WOMAN: Mrs. Paradine.

Excuse me.

Oh, you poor darling.

We heard that you 
 were in London.

Your poor dear Aunt Grace.

How sad for you her passing.

Well, I took matters 
 into my own hands

As soon as I realized that 
 you were sailing with us.

You can dine at our 
 table, of course.

And no moments alone, 
 I'll see to that.

And my granddaughter Lulu, 
 she'll keep you company,

and my baby Charlie.

Lulu, don't slump.

It's so lovely to see you.

Don't look now.

That's the infamous Molly Brown.

Her husband made a fortune 
 in silver and gold mines.

But they say he tried 
 to shoot her twice.

It was a terrible scandal.

She's crude, but one 
 can't ignore her.

She's far too rich.

Oh, the strausses.

They own Macy's 
 department store.

Jewish.

Oh, and Benjamin Guggenheim.

Ha.

Most people are content

to bring back souvenirs of 
 the eiffel tower from Paris.

He's bringing back his mistress.

Well, he's not sitting 
 at our table. Huh.

Oh, the Wideners.

Al, Lulu, the-- the-- the Wideners.

AL: For heaven's sake, 
 how are you, old man?

Tugs all fast.

Take her out, Robert.

When do we get 
 on the boat, Mommy?

Oh, we're on the boat, darling.

Looks like a hotel to me.

Ha ha ha ha. 
 - Ha ha ha ha.

See?

See there, little darling?

Wave to all the people. 
 Good-bye to England.

Good-bye, England.

MAN: Here, now!

I've been robbed!

I've been robbed! Here! Here!

Me life! It's me life! 
 You can't do this to me!

Me life is on that ship!

Here, get off me!

You can't go!

[ ship's horn blows ]

Is, uh, something wrong, Miss?

I left my family 
 back in Denmark.

I may never see them again.

I brought my mother's 
 nightcap from the clothesline.

It's all I have of her.

Well, more than I have of mine.

I look for a better life.

Yeah, me, too.

Oh, my heart is divided.

Yeah, well, it's better 
 you don't have a heart.

An emigrant must have courage.

You have to keep 
 thinking of that,

to be grateful to be on 
 this beautiful ship.

This is nothing.

Steerage.

Now, up there in first class,

they got gold mirrors 
 and crystal chandeliers.

What is this first class?

We'll all get to America 
 at the same time.

Yeah, but they get there in style.

That's where I plan 
 to do business,

there in first class.

It don't take courage,

it takes smarts.

Throw that bit of 
 raggedy cap away.

Let go of the past.

Hey!

Uh, this gate is locked.

Well, now, that is 
 the idea, isn't it?

Steerage can't mingle 
 amongst the other passengers.

Why?

Yank immigration laws, on 
 account of infectious diseases.

Well, I'm not asking 
 you to kiss me.

Ha ha.

Just let me through.

I'm not about to lose my 
 stripes on the first day out.

I just want a look around.

Nobody will know the difference.

In that suit?

What's wrong with 
 my bloody suit?

# I gave my love a cherry #

# What had no stone #

Come on, let's go.

# I gave my love a chicken #

# That had no bone # 
 - Trevor's cold, Alice.

Please, it's cold out here.

# I gave my love-- #

It's night, Alice.

Trevor needs his supper. 
 You're supposed to take care of us.

Stop whining.

Stop whining.

Stop whining.

Come on, Alice.

Excuse-- excuse, please, 
 these children.

Did you see Mrs. Astor?

Mrs. Astor?

Mrs. John Jacob Astor?

You don't know who 
 John Jacob Astor is?

The richest man in the world?

I think I know you.

Were you in Cairo last month

with the Hendersons' baby?

I never been to Cairo.

Oh, Mrs. Astor.

Your cape.

You'll catch cold.

And in your condition...

it's chilly out here. 
 You can't be too careful.

You're right, Miss Miller.

I keep telling my wife that.

Now promise me you 
 will eat a good dinner.

They say a body 
 needs these things

they've discovered 
 called Vitamins.

She eats like a bird, you know.

She's eating for two now, and 
 she's not getting her Vitamins.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

Just a few more moments, 
 John, please,

before we have to walk 
 into the dining room.

I have to be calm-- ha--

and regal when they 
 all start to gossip.

Come, my dear.

[ music plays ]

[ laughing ]

Mr. Astor, Mrs. Astor.

Mother Foley, the Astors.

Ah!

I should think they would 
 be dining in their stateroom.

I mean, the nerve, They must 
 have boarded at Cherbourg.

Mr. Astor is a frequent 
 passenger on the white star line.

But not with her. 
 I know the real Mrs. Astor,

the first Mrs. Astor.

They say she's expecting.

Well, she could have a 
 litter of little Astors,

but she will never be 
 accepted in polite society.

Ah, the hell with polite society.

They got each other 
 and the U.S. Mint.

Oh, excuse me.

Captain Smith.

Ah, how may I 
 assist you, madam?

It's about Lulu.

Uh, your daughter?

Oh-- ha-- actually, 
 my granddaughter.

We are always mistaken.

Captain, I was wondering,

perhaps you might know of 
 some nice gentleman on board

who might be of some 
 company to Lulu,

someone dignified,

substantial.

Someone like yourself, only--

only, uh, younger.

No, no, no, no, not younger.

Lulu is so incomplete.

Uh, an older man 
 would be helpful.

No, I-- I meant someone...

Well-to-do. Wealthier.

Exactly. The trip to 
 europe was disastrous.

All the men are 
 foreigners, fortune hunters.

Well, I promise you,

I will keep my eyes open.

Oh, thank you, Captain.

Another bottle, sir?

I'd like it before we get to 
 New York, if you don't mind.

[ laughter ]

Good health!

This is my third crossing 
 with the captain,

and last time I even 
 sat at his table.

25 years, is it?

With the white star line, yes.

The world's greatest ship and 
 the world's greatest captain.

Here's to a rip-roarin' 
 maiden voyage for us Titanic.

Well, since it is my last voyage,

I was hoping for 
 something a little calmer.

How fast are we going, Captain?

I have a wager on 
 with Allison here.

I say we're traveling 
 in excess of 20 knots.

If you will excuse me.

Captain Smith doesn't 
 like to talk about speed,

but I think it's safe to say that 
 Mr. Allison owes you some money.

Ohh.

Now, Mrs. Brown, would you 
 care for some more oysters?

Ooh! Don't mind if I do.

They're delicious.

Big and fat and juicy.

Oh, and some more-- some 
 more wine, please?

Lafite-Rothschild.

We don't get wine 
 like this in Denver.

Boy, you built some 
 rowboat here, Mr. Ismay.

Well, I'm glad you're 
 impressed, Mrs. Brown.

Yes, I was determined to 
 create a ship for the 20th century.

One must be a visionary.

Now, may I recommend 
 the pressed pheasant,

or perhaps the, uh, poularde 
 poche a l'estragon.

Ha ha. No skinny little 
 poularde for me.

I'm havin' roast mutton,

agneau et mouton.

You speak french?

I hired a french tutor.

He pulled a cork from a champagne 
 bottle and put it in my mouth--

The cork, not the bottle.

He said it'd force me to hold 
 my mouth open when I talk.

Well, I told him most people 
 preferred me with my mouth shut.

Ha ha ha ha. 
 - Ha ha ha ha.

We are forgetting Mrs. Paradine.

All this festivity.

Poor darling. Her dear Aunt 
 Grace passed recently in London.

All those months 
 alone in London,

taking care of the burial 
 and your aunt's affairs.

I supposed things were... jumbled.

We promised your husband 
 that we'd watch over you

on the voyage home.

That's very kind of you.

The Paradines have the most 
 beautiful estate on the Hudson,

and their little girl is a dream.

Miss Foley, could I have 
 the pleasure of a dance?

Oh, well, Lulu would love 
 to dance, Mr. Park,

as long as it isn't that 
 abominable turkey trot.

One wonders what the 
 world is coming to sometimes.

Posture, Lulu.

Such a charming man,

and so very handsome.

Our little Lulu could do worse.

Our little Lulu couldn't 
 do any better.

He's shrewd-- ha ha-- intelligent.

And loaded.

A marriage made in heaven.

You must long to dance, too 
 a young woman like you.

It's so sad you're stuck in 
 black for the whole crossing.

It doesn't domuch for your...

delicate complexion.

I suppose your aunt's 
 husband is grieving.

The marriage only lasted 
 a year, Mrs. Foley.

I don't know where 
 Mr. Santilese is now.

Why, she gave up everything 
 for that Scoundrel.

Well, what can you 
 expect? An italian.

He was after her 
 inheritance. I said so.

Poor woman.

On the contrary, Mrs. Foley.

My aunt had no regrets.

In fact, just before she died, 
 she told me it was a glorious year.

No matter what the price, 
 it was worth a lifetime.

Would you excuse me?

I have such a terrible headache.

Oh, poor lady.

Let me help you to your room.

No, no, please. Please, 
 continue with your dinner.

Isabella, wait.

Go back to your dancing 
 partner, Mr. Park.

You're jealous.

You're jealous.

Now you know how I feel.

You can imagine what's been 
 happening to me all these years.

Eddie Paradine has everything 
 your family's ever wanted for you--

money and a pedigree.

He's a kind man,

a gentleman, a good husband.

Oh, your marriage must 
 have pleased your father

and your mother.

My parents are both dead now,

and the past is the past,

irretrievable.

It's been with me every 
 moment of every day.

Don't you think it's 
 been the same for me?

Oh, Bella.

Oh, Bella...

I'm married, Wynn.

I never expected to see you again.

You broke my heart.

What do you think of me brood?

Nice children.

Nice wife, too.

I wouldn't be much without 'em.

You planning to have pups yourself?

Ha! Me? No. No, no.

I wouldn't be so good at it,

uh, raising pups, I mean.

Damn!

"Crew only."

There has to be another way up.

I might as well be in prison.

What's out there, Mr. Boxhall?

Looks like a freighter.

Yes, sir.

The Rappahannock 
 on opposite course.

She's morseing us.

She's warning us of icebergs

and heavy ice pack ahead.

Where are the other Binoculars?

They only gave us one 
 pair for the bridge.

Mr. Boxhall, I will not 
 have my officers

passing around one 
 bloody pair of glasses.

Now take the ones 
 from the crow's nest.

The lookouts won't like this.

I'm not concerned 
 with what they like.

They'll manage well enough

until we reach New York.

J.J., you sure you won't 
 join us for another hand?

No, no. 
 Nightcap and then to bed.

I promised my wife.

I forgot. You're a Newlywed.

What's the matter,

never seen a woman 
 smoke a cigar before?

Well, no.

I mean, not a lady, anyway.

Not like you.

Well, get used to it.

Woman's emancipation.

We can smoke cigars.

We can tell you men 
 how to run the world.

Hell, we'll probably 
 have a woman president

in the next 100 years.

Unfortunately,

I don't think I'll be 
 around to see that.

Well, I hope I won't.

Can I buy you another drink?

Some brew on me.

Whatever he's drinking.

I come into a bit 
 of money recently.

I'll share my good fortune.

Well, thank you, young man.

You, uh, down in your cups?

You might say that.

I've remarried recently.

Hmm. Well, that'll do it.

Ha ha! No, no. 
 I'm happily married.

I'm only worried 
 about the reception

my new wife received 
 tonight in the dining room.

She's very young.

People can be cruel.

Yeah, well...

bunch of stiffs,

full of themselves 
 and all their money.

Mmm.

Some tugboat, eh?

Yes. It's a thing of beauty.

Have you been to America before?

No. No. Looking forward to it.

Yeah, I might go into 
 a bit of business.

You ever hear of this chap 
 called, um, Mack Sennett?

Got hisself a moving-picture company.

Calls it keystone.

Up-and-coming sort of thing.

Let me give you a bit of advice.

I always find investors 
 for my projects.

It's better to use another 
 fellow's money.

Yeah. Well said. 
 I can drink to that.

I believe in using the 
 other fellow's money, too.

Actually, I'm thinking 
 more about, um...

acting in the keystone company.

Might do a bit of shakespeare.

Well, I'm sure you'll 
 do well in America,

Whatever you decide at,

young fellow like yourself.

Yeah, well, nice to meet you.

Oh!

Clumsy.

So sorry.

My wife will think I'm a sot.

I'll have this cleaned for you.

I've got connections 
 in the laundry.

Don't worry about it.

Good evening to you,

and I will watch for you

in the moving pictures.

Another brandy, man,

and make it a double.

Yes, sir.

[ moaning ]

[ baby crying ]

No!

No!

[ moaning ]

Alice, wake up.

You're having a nightmare.

My baby.

He was dead in the water.

Dead.

It's only a dream, Alice.

You don't have a baby, Alice.

That's right, Lorraine. 
 Now go back to sleep.

Mummy's here, sweetness.

We don't want to 
 frighten the children,

now, do we?

The ice. There was 
 ice and a shipwreck,

and he was out there 
 in the freezing water.

Oh, dear, now. The baby.

Alice, please.

Shh. There now, honey.

Oh. Shh.

What is it?

A bad dream, appearently.

She's very...

nervous.

His night garment's on backwards.

We stop at Queenstown tomorrow.

I think it's best for all of us

if Alice gets off there, in Ireland.

My baby.

My poor little baby.

Are you lost, Mr. Dickie?

Oh... you.

Look, I know I'm not 
 supposed to be up here,

but an acquaintance of mine 
 invited me up for a drink.

Oh, son, let me give you 
 a piece of advice.

Take it from your old da.

You're holding

Mr. John Jacob Astor's Billfold.

I saw you life it in the bar.

You didn't realize that, 
 now, did you, Mr. Dickie?

John Jacob Astor?

I don't know what 
 you're talking about.

I'm trying to be 
 your friend here, son.

Everybody needs a friend.

I told you--

You put the bit on 
 the great man hisself.

I just want to keep you 
 out of trouble, that's all.

A nice young chap like you.

There's a good boy.

The best.

You don't want to get 
 caught on your first night out

stealing Billfolds,

especially one 
 belonging to Mr. Astor.

It's all there.

I'll tell him I found it 
 laying on the floor

by the bar.

Must have dropped it, eh?

You're not going to report me?

Of course not.

I helped you before, didn't I?

The time to be picking Billfolds

is the last night out.

Men get all their moola 
 out of the safe.

Now, I'm sure we can 
 work out something

that'll be good for the both of us.

You're a talented lad, you are.

I could see that right away.

Quick and slick with 
 your hands, you are.

What's your name, son?

Your real name.

Well, it don't really 
 matter now, does it?

Don't be so prickly.

I can't help if I worry a bit

about the real Mr. Merriam Dickie.

You didn't ax the fellow, did you?

Of course not.

He passed out... drunk.

[ laughing ]

Drunk as a skunk, eh, Dickie?

I can see you and I

are going to get along really well.

[ laughing ]

All passengers 
 disembarking in Ireland

must proceed to the boat deck.

We have landed in Queenstown.

ALICE: Please, sir!

No! Don't make me go. 
 I beg you.

You've been fairly treated.

I've given you plenty of money

for your boat fare back to England.

Oh, you're kind people,

you have to understand.

I'm just a young girl 
 alone in the world.

Please, Miss, you've upset my wife.

All this talk about your baby.

I couldn't help it.

See, I had a baby what died.

Your baby died?

Where's your husband?

There's no husband, sir.

Anyway, he ran off.

I can't go back to England.

Don't cry. Here.

Will you promise to keep 
 these things to yourself?

It would only upset my wife.

Yes, sir,

I promise.

It would also help

if you could get through 
 the children's supper

wihtout spilling soup.

Well, I'm nervous,

but I'll do better now.

If I give you this chance,

you won't let me down?

My word, sir.

I give you my word.

And I thank you 
 for the opportunity

to stay on this ship.

I do, sir.

I thank my lucky stars.

Hello and goodbye to Ireland.

The emerald isle,

so green and beautiful.

Makes me wonder if I 
 should just stop here.

Close to home--

is that what you're thinking?

No. I try not to think of them--

my mother,

my little brother and sisters.

Their life is so hard.

I try to think of the future only,

like you.

No. No, not like me.

You don't want to be like me.

Anyway, you'll send for 
 your family someday.

Yes. How do you know that?

You don't know me.

Well, I know that you're good,

a good person.

Maybe the only good 
 person I've ever known.

[ morse code signal beeping ]

So, uh...

which is which, then, eh?

Oh. Green's where I've been.

Yellow's where I want to go.

Right. You know, uh, Phillips,

you're probably the only bloke

that took the ad seriously.

"Join the Marconi company 
 see the world."

Hey, well, here we are.

Yeah, like hell. See the world?

How are we suppose to 
 see the world, Phillips,

stuck in this bloody Brom closet?

Wynn Park. 
 I'm expecting a Marconi-Gram.

Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Park.

There's so many messages 
 coming and going.

There we are.

There you are, sir.

I'll be expecting several others.

I'd like them delivered immediately.

Right, sir.

Smooth sailing all the way.

I hope so.

Hoo.

Cheers, governor.

It's a double eagle.

It's a $20 piece.

Look at that.

Tin mines.

Didn't that wire say tin mines?

Uh-huh. You split that with me?

Right.

Ahh. 
 - Oh-ho-ho.

Hey?

"Please forgive me. I was a bore."

Oh, Wynn.

A red dress?

Do you see that, a red dress?

It can't be. She's in mourning.

She appears to have recovered.

Pomme Duchesse.

Where I come from,

we call a spud a spud.

she's not sittng here. 
 I won't have it.

This is a disgrace.

Hazel.

It's only been a few months

since her Aunt Grace passed away.

She ought to show some respect,

even though her aunt was... fast.

Mrs. Paradine.

You feeling better?

I am, Mr. Ismay, thank you.

I feel queasy.

Mr. Park?

Oh, he had urgent business.

I understand the 
 Bolivian government

has given him permission 
 to open some tin mines.

That's dangerous.

That-- that Zapata fellow.

That's Mexico, my dear.

It's the same thing.

Oh, here he is.

I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

Evening. I'm sorry I'm late.

So, it's mining, is it?

Takes perseverance.

Me and my man, we never 
 gave up when others did.

Our little Johnny mine 
 turned out to be

the richest gold vein in the world.

Of course, it didn't 
 exactly buy us happiness.

Well, money doesn't always 
 get us what we want.

You unlucky in love, Mr. Park?

My family tree is missing 
 a few branches.

I set out to prove to 
 a young lady's parents

that I was worthy of her,

and she married someone else.

Mr. Park, you could have 
 any woman in the world.

Except the one I want.

You'll be going there, 
 Mr. Park, to Bolivia?

Yes.

As soon as we land in New York.

Oh, you can come to 
 our Lulu's birthday party.

I mean, one little week.

The Bolivian government can wait.

[ orchestra playing a tango ]

Mrs. Paradine.

Will you tango?

I thought you'd never ask, Mr. Park.

My dear...

are you forgetting?

You are in mourning.

I've mourned enough.

Oh, my. I feel absolutely faint.

Dancing the tango?

We haven't even finished 
 the first course.

They're just skipping to dessert.

My.

[ music ends ]

[ knock on door ]

Wynn-- oh.

I beg your pardon, ma'am?

Excuse me, I thought Mr. Par--

Oh, I believe he went up 
 for an early breakfast.

Mrs. Paradine, I have 
 wonderful news for you.

I have managed to convince 
 the Countess of Rothes

that she absolutely must 
 take this stateroom.

Her servants have 
 packed all her things,

so, here I am ready to move you.

Move me?

Well, you weren't happy in this suite,

and it's my job to make you happy.

Ah, yes, well, 
 that won't be necessary.

I'm quite happy here now.

Yes, but I've arranged for it.

The Countess of Rothes--

it took a great deal of maneuvering.

I-- I've changed my mind.

I'm completely comfortable here. 
 Thank you.

Yes, but what do I tell 
 the Countess of Rothes?

MAN: Very smooth.

I slept like a baby last night.

Excuse me.

Bad news, Captain?

Um, no, Mr. Strauss,

just, uh...

Routine.

You and Mrs. Strauss 
 enjoy your breakfast.

CAPTAIN: Mr. Ismay.

Ah, yes, what is it?

A message from the ship Baltic

regarding ice conditions.

I'm told that you've been 
 discussing operation of the ship

with my crew.

Yes, with regard to our speed.

It's certainly within my 
 prepogative as chairman.

Things are running smoothly--

the machinery is bearing the test,

the boilers are running well.

The ship is steady,

and with power to spare.

We can beat the olympic's record

and be in New York on Tuesday.

I see absolutely no purpose 
 in arriving a day early.

Yes, and I see no 
 purpose in meandering,

keeping to a schedule 
 devised for inferior vessels.

But there are basic...

safety procedures nonetheless.

I want this ship to perform 
 to its full potential.

Well...

in future, if there's any discussion 
 about the operation of this ship,

it must be cleared with me first.

This may be my last crossing...

but I am still the captain.

Wynn?

Good morning.

Good morning.

You couldn't sleep?

No.

Me, neither.

And I was up thinking about you--

your life...

and your daughter...

Claire.

She's such a tomboy.

Hates fancy clothers.

She's very bright, curious.

She loves dogs.

She loves horses. She rides 
 for hours with her father.

What are we going to do?

All those years I've 
 wondered about you--

where you were and 
 what you were doing.

And now you're here.

With you.

For 4 days.

[ footsteps and children's voices ]

You're it! Ha!

Oh.

Osa, what you going 
 to do in America?

I'm going to Minnesota 
 with the other converts

to build a new life.

Oh, I want to do good in 
 this world, Mr. Dickie.

Do good?

I want to be a teacher or a nurse,

have children of my own.

And raise them to be good souls

and to help their fellow man,

like Mrs. Jack teaches her children.

Oh, the Jacks have been so kind to me.

What's your dream?

My dream?

Yeah.

You have a dream. 
 I can see it in your eyes.

You know something, Osa?

I do have a dream.

Have you ever seen one 
 of those moving pictures?

Moving pictures?

Yeah. I saw one at a 
 carnival peep show once.

I put my eye to the hole in the box,

and there was people in there--

moving.

Oh, I mean, they wasn't 
 really in there,

but it was like they was.

There was this beauty,

Mary Pickford.

That's my dream.

Mary Pickford?

No, no, not her.

I mean, my dream is 
 to be a part of it,

part of the moving pictures.

Well...

then you must work for 
 it and make it happen.

No, stupid pipe dream.

Anyway...

you could be in 
 the moving pictures.

I mean, you're-- you're much 
 prettier than Mary Pickford.

Well...

moving pictures sound nice,

but I'm not looking 
 for pictures in a box.

What you looking for?

God.

CHILD: Osa, Osa.

CHILD 2: Can't catch us.

CAPTAIN: They say we're at 
 the dawn of a new age.

The fires below are sending

50,000 horsepower to the propellers.

Who knows what kind of progress

we'll see in the next 100 years?

Soon we'll be flying across 
 the Atlantic in airplanes.

But nothing will ever 
 be like this again--

Nothing like the Titanic,

a boat this big and powerful...

and so beautiful.

There's a rumor we'll be 
 landing a day early.

Only rumors.

Captain Smith...

could we bribe you

to take your time,

to meander off course a little?

I know what you mean.

I suppose I will miss all of this.

There's a magic to it.

I enjoy it most right here

behind the wheel.

It's almost sacred.

May I steer it?

Oh, you're right.

It is magical.

I can feel the power 
 beneath my feet.

Are you sure that you 
 know the way to New York?

Ha ha! No, I don't.

Maybe I'll just turn it 
 around and go back to England.

How does that sound?

It's not fair.

She's a married lady.

Well, what do you expect?

A man loses his head

when a woman throws herself at him.

But he danced with me.

Well, it wouldn't have hurt for 
 you to throw yourself a little, Lulu.

Get your shoulders back.

You're going to get a hump.

[ Orchestra playing ]

Most of them don't bother to 
 leave their jewels with the purser.

They want to wear them.

Come on...

I'll show you.

Hey.

Room service.

WOMAN: Wrong room.

Room service.

What did I tell you?

[ laughs ]

Wait, wait, wait.

Lookie here.

What do you say?

A diamond tiara.

Go ahead.

Try it on for size.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

We case out all the staterooms,

find out where they keep them,

and, then, on the last night out...

We strike.

That's right, my friend.

There'll be confusion in the morning.

How do we get it off the boat?

The loot never leaves the ship.

Mr. Astor's loo.

In the plumbing.

We lay low and go about our business

until the ship is fitted out, 
 ready to sail again.

I've got a plumber friend here.

He's agreed to carry it 
 all off in his tool kit.

I don't know.

You don't know what?

Well, how do I trust you?

[ chuckles ]

Is that my buddy?

Trust me?

How do you know

I wouldn't turn you in this minute

if I got the urge?

Hey, don't try to blackmail me.

I could tell 'em a few things meself.

I've worked for the white 
 star line for 12 years.

I'm a trusted employee.

Who do you think they're 
 going to believe--

me...

or Mr. Dickie,

who isn't Mr. Dickie at all?

[ woman laughs ]

Come on, boy. 
 Better get out of here.

The tiara.

Oh, God.

What if--

Shh.

WOMAN: I was playing the piano.

[ whispering ] Not a word.

I was watching you from the 
 hallway, waiting for your father.

Wrong door.

Yes, wrong door.

It's the next one.

I've never been in such 
 a grand house before,

and there you were-- you were--

you were playing the piano.

Chopin.

I didn't know what it was.

I only knew it was the 
 most beautiful music.

And the sun was coming 
 through the windows,

and everything was golden, 
 and the sun and you...

the dress.

Dressing gown--

and it was yellow, it wasn't golden.

Anyway, the door was 
 supposed to have been closed.

[ woman clears throat ]

MAN: Oh, yes.

MAN: There we are.

[ drops keys ]

[ laughing ]

The lady lost her key.

It was see-through,

your dressing gown.

It was not.

Yes, it was. When you stood up,

I could see you through it.

I thought I was going to die.

We found your room.

Mm-hmm.

Well?

Can you get the key in the lock?

Can you?

I'm trying.

Can you get the key 
 in the lock? Can you?

Hurry up, son.

It's not good to be 
 seen up here together.

All right.

Mr. Dickie...

we're going to make a killing.

[ giggles ]

Look at you.

Where have you been?

Eh, first class,

Hobobbing with the rick folk.

A real dandy, all right.

If only Mary Pickle 
 could see you now.

Pickford. Mary Pickford.

You look beautiful.

But, Osa, men aren't 
 supposed to look beautiful.

Why?

Take me word. I'm not 
 beautiful, not in any way.

You are beautiful to me.

I don't know,

maybe something has rubbed 
 off of you and onto me.

Ohh...

I didn't want to remember this.

[ scottish accent ] She's a 
 thoroughbred, Mr. Lightoller.

I'd swear there was a boat 
 drill scheduled for this morning.

Well, if I know the captain, 
 we'll skip it.

Some fool's gone and set it

for the same time as 
 the Sunday service,

and the captain surely 
 won't miss saying devotions.

MAN: Chief Bell!

Hear, Mr. Chairman.

Don't look so shocked, 
 Mr. Lightoller.

I frequently check in the boiler rooms.

Tell me, uh...

How many boilers are currently lit?

24 of the 29 are in service.

That's, uh, 80%, is it?

84, and the propellers are 
 at 75 revolutions per minute.

And our speed?

21 1/2 knots, sir.

Have the men light 2 additional boilers.

I have no order from the captain.

You have my orders, Chief.

I want us at 22 1/2 knots by noon.

Carry on.

Mmm...

Oh.

Mmm...

[ chuckles ]

Oh. What day is this?

Sunday.

Everyone's at church 
 service except us.

We're the sinners.

Mmm...

You knew I was sailing 
 on the Titanic, didn't you?

Yes.

It wasn't fate at all.

You planned it that way.

Yes.

But it isn't enough.

God, I want to be with you always.

Come to Bolivia.

Oh, I--

I know I have no right 
 to ask, but come with me.

Wynn... 
 - Come with me.

I don't know.

I just don't know.

Does it have to end?

Ohh...

They that go down to the sea in ships

and do business in the great waters,

they cry out to the Lord...

in their trouble,

and he bringeth them 
 out of their distresses.

In Psalms 107, verse 29,

"He maketh the storm a calm..."

"so that the waves 
 there of... are stilled."

"So he bringeth them

unto their desired haven."

That girl sets my hair on end. 
 - Shh!

Amen.

ALL: Amen.

[ tapping morse code ]

[ beeping ]

Got the messauber here.

[ beeping ]

She's reporting 
 heavy pack ice ahead.

Large bergs...

and field ice.

Huh.

Right. Well, uh, I'll 
 run it up to the bridge.

Actually, not now. 
 It's 20 minutes to 5:00.

Let's clear through some 
 of this backlog first, eh?

Right. Fine.

[ piano playing ]

You know, you must come visit 
 me sometime in Denver, Captain.

I'm-- I'm having' a 
 huge party in June.

Well, I expect that in June 
 I shall be in Hampstead

making up for all the 
 gardening I've been missing

for the last 40 years.

I'd... like to spend a little time

with my wife and daughter.

Oh...

Lovely.

I understand.

My husband J.J. is 
 ambitious and-- and smart.

But he's more comportable 
 in Leadville.

Myself... I want to be more civilized.

I guess that's why we've 
 gone our separate ways.

Tell me something, Captain Smith.

Won't you miss the sea?

I suppose I shall.

But just between you and me,

sometimes being on a ship

is like being in jail...

with the possibility of drowning.

Ha ha ha! 
 - Ha ha ha!

Well, you've just got 3 more days.

Yes, only 3 more days

Then you're a free man.

Lorraine, don't run. You're spill it.

Whoop!

What's going on here?

Now, look what a mess you made.

You seem to have your 
 hands full. I'm Marge Miller.

What's your name?

Her name is Alice.

Lorraine. Shh!

Now, come along.

Bye.

Mrs. Paradine.

Oh, hello.

You look happy.

I am.

I think I am.

Mrs. Astor--

Oh, please call me Madeleine.

Madeleine, may I talk to you?

I feel like I'm going to burst.

Of course.

Shall we?

What was it like when 
 Mr. Astor got his divorce?

It was painful.

For everyone.

I felt terribly guilty.

But we've embarked 
 on a new adventure.

I try not to look back.

Are you... contemplating divorce?

I have a young daughter.

I could never leave my daughter.

Oh, but surely you could arrange 
 something with your husband.

He would never let her go.

I couldn't hurt him, either.

In a way, I feel indebted to him.

He helped me at a 
 terrible time in my life.

He was-- he was my knight 
 in shining armor.

You're in love with 
 Mr. Park, aren't you?

Yes.

I have loved him for many years.

These things seem like 
 they can never work out,

but somehow they do.

Life is so short, Isabella.

There's hardly any time, is there?

Anything important?

Another ice warning, sir.

It's from the Coronia.

Hmm. Post the coordinates.

I will, sir.

Remarkably cold tonight, is it not?

Yes, it is.

I've sent word to take care 
 with the fresh water supply.

It'll be below freezing 
 during the night.

Not much wind.

A flat calm.

In 24 years, I've never 
 seen so calm a sea.

Hmm.

"Low, low..."

"Breathe and blow,

"wind from the western sea.

"Over the rolling waters go,

"come from the dying moon...

and blow."

Sir.

Upon my word, I have 
 not thought of that verse

since I was a cabin boy.

Love of the ocean brought 
 me to the sea as a lad,

and there's still...

wonder in it.

Ah...

Are we not a bit fast?

Uh, Mr. Ismay, sir.

He seems intent on breaking records.

He was in the boiler room today.

I'm going below. Keep sharp.

The first sign of any... haziness,

we'll need to slow down.

I'll deal with Mr. Ismay 
 in the morning.

Yes, sir.

Captain Moore...

white patches ahead.

That'll mean ice.

Stop the engines!

Stop down the boilers!

Go into position for the night!

[ bell clangs ]

[ lively music ]

Dance with us!

Come on, dance! 
 - Dance!

Come on. The children are 
 saying for you to dance!

Come on, boy!

No shame in having some joy.

No, no. I-- I don't know how.

I'll show you.

Right now upstairs 
 the wine is flowing,

and the jewels are sparkling.

The stars are jewels.

We're all the same under the stars.

I'd get them for you if I could.

All them stars.

There's so much out there

just waiting for us to scoop it up.

I promised you a tiara,

and Jamie Purse is 
 gonna get you one.

Who is Jamie Purse?

Oh... yeah.

I forgot.

Um...

Jamie Purse is my real name.

But... Mr. Dickie?

Uh, that was...

just the name on the ticket.

How did you get the ticket?

You're not a thief.

Um... fact is, I-- I found it.

You're right.

I'm not a thief.

I just seized the opportunity.

If you'll excuse me...

I don't mean to interrupt, madam,

but, uh, me and Mr. Dickie

have an appointment

with the ship's purser.

I got to go.

The purser.

Don't go with him.

I have to.

Haven't you ever had to do things...

been forced to do things?

I try to stay true to myself, 
 if that is what you mean.

You're so bloody good.

Always on the straight and narrow.

Well, that's not the way 
 the world works.

Look, maybe I'm not so great, 
 but I can change.

I wouldn't mind a 
 piece of her myself.

You want to get 
 smashed in the face?

You do, and you'll end up 
 in the ship's brig,

you silly bugger.

Now... I'm having a jar

with the purser in his office.

Perfect time for you to life 
 the key out of his pocket.

Magic hands like yours...

no problem.

Understand?

All right!

You just stay away from her.

You hear me?

She's too good for the likes of you.

[ snickering ]

And me.

[ bell clangs 4 times ]

4 bells.

10:00.

Ocean's as smooth as a mill pond.

Water's like oil.

I was saying the same 
 to the captain.

He left word to be called 
 if conditions become doubtful.

Good night, Mr. Murdock.

Yes. Right.

Good night, Mr. Lightoller.

It's cold out tonight.

Aye. By the smell of it, 
 there's ice about.

You smell it before you get to it.

Of course, I wouldn't 
 tell the Bigwigs that.

They think you're stupid.

But you know what I say.

We're the eyes of this here ship.

Well, don't expect no respect.

What I expect is 
 some proper glasses.

I've got good eyesight,

but I can't see in the dark.

Well, I asked again just tonight.

They would like to 
 have bit me head off.

I'm through with the bloomin' sea.

After this one, I'll go back home,

make an honest woman of me Linda.

There's a ship.

Off the southeast.

That looks like a big passenger liner,

maybe 10 miles away.

No. 
 She's something like ourselves--

a small freighter.

Not that far.

Any other ships in the vicinity?

The closest one's the, uh, Titanic.

Can't be the Titanic.

She's closer to us in size.

That must be a freighter...

or a fishing boat.

Maybe.

Have evans radio the Titanic.

Tell them we've stopped 
 for the night...

surrounded by ice.

Yes, sir.

Phillips.

I'll never get through all these.

Yes, ma'am?

I wish to send a wire.

Right, then.

Address at the top.

My husband is at 
 our home on the Hudson.

This has to go out immediately.

Do you understand?

Yes, ma'am. The thing of it is--

We're bogged down here right now.

The wireless broke down last night

and wasn't back in commission 
 until 5:00 this morning.

We've got quite a backlog, ma'am.

Please. This has to 
 go out immediately.

You have to send it 
 right away before I...

Before, ma'am?

Before I lose my strength.

Before I change my mind.

Please, just send it.

Well, uh, don't worry, ma'am.

It's very urgent.

Promise me.

We'll do the best we can, eh?

[ whistles ]

Some bloody bloke's going 
 to get the shock of his life.

[ incoming telegraph ]

Shut up.

Shut up. You're jamming me.

Damn freighter Californian.

Stopped for the night 
 on account of ice.

They keep interrupting.

Bloody Titanic wants me to shut up?

Well, the same to you, Bucko.

I can't get 
 Mrs. Paradine's message out.

Poor lady.

Can I offer you a fag, chief?

Aye, thanks, Jack.

It's me prize. 
 Tobaccy from the East Indies.

Keeps it next to me heart.

It's me treasure.

Ow. That hurt.

Are there really angels, Mama?

Of course there are angels...

watching over you and your 
 sister and your brothers.

Over all of us.

And over this ship to 
 make sure we're safe.

Ohh, you're a mass of snarls, 
 Miss Ophelia Jack.

You need one of them angels 
 down here to brush it out.

It doesn't look right,

young girl like you alone in the world

talking to that Hooligan.

We are all God's children.

You said so yourself.

Chap like that cause 
 you nothing but pain.

There. Here we are.

You're almost an angel yourself.

We're off to bed now, Osa.

Sweet dreams, Osa.

Sweet dreams.

You say your prayers, Osa.

God will keep you from harm.

And all the angels, too, Mama.

And all the angels, too.

Hello, miss.

What- what? No! What are you--

Your boyfriend's not around 
 to protect you, right?

Let me go!

No!

I beg you. Let me go.

Aah!

You're a piece, you are.

I had my eye on you from the start.

Let me go! Let me go!

You're going nowhere.

I knew from the first 
 time I laid eyes on you

that you were no saint.

22 1/2 knots.

What are we doing? 
 It's not a race.

We have our orders, Mr. Boxhall.

Hope Mr. Astor won't be 
 playing cards too late.

I hate to go to bed alone.

I put a nice warm bottle 
 under the covers, ma'am.

It'll be very comfy.

Finished?

Mm-hmm.

I was talking to the Allisons' nanny.

Such a strange bird, she is.

I've been racking my brain 
 trying to remember

where I know here from.

Her name is Alice.

That's what the little girl said.

Alice.

Oh, Mrs. Astor, I must 
 go get your husband.

It just came to me.

Alice Cleaver, that's who she is.

What are you talking about?

Um, nothing. 
 Nothing that concerns you.

Who is Alice Cleaver?

Not in your condition. 
 I'll speak with Mr. Astor.

He'll know what's do be done.

You boys keep playing like this,

you're going to pay for my trip.

[ laughing ]

And tomorrow night, poker.

You must excuse me 
 for just a moment.

We'll wait.

He's the one with the money.

Is something wrong with my wife?

Oh, no, no. She's safe in bed.

Well, what is it, then?

You must go have a word 
 with Mr. Allison, sir.

You must warn him.

What are you babbling about?

The nanny. I recognize her, sir.

Alice Cleaver.

She was convicted about 3 years ago

for... for murdering her baby.

Where did you hear all this rubbish?

It was in the paper.

They let her out of prison.

Said she was deranged at the time

on account of the baby's 
 father deserting her.

They granted her leniency,

which is no excuse if you ask me. 
 Her little child--

It's after 11:00. 
 I can't go wake them up now.

But she's in charge of 
 the Allison children, sir,

and she's a murderer.

Perhaps you're mistaken.

At any rate, 
 nothing will happen tonight.

I will talk with 
 Mr. Allison in the morning.

I'm sure he won't mind 
 your waking him up

under the circumstances.

In the morning, Miss Miller.

I will speak with 
 Mr. Allison in the morning.

But she--

she threw him from a train.

Her baby boy.

A touch of haze on the horizon.

There's ice ahead!

Is someone there?

Yes. What do you see?

Ice! Dead ahead!

A berg less than a mile away!

Thank you.

Iceberg right ahead.

Hard astarboard, Mr. Hitchens.

Hard astarboard.

Helm is hard over, sir.

Full speed astern!

Turn!

[ bell rings ]

There's an iceberg ahead.

Come on.

Come on.

Turn, you whore, turn.

What's taking her so long?

Turn!

We're going to hit the bloody thing!

Turn!

We hit it, man!

Oh, no! We're dead!

[ gasps ]

What was that?

I think we hit something.

It felt like a hit.

Hey! What's happening?

[ alarm blares ]

Close the damps now. 
 Move, quickly!

We can't allow water into the boiler!

Aah!

I'm, uh, I'm closing 
 the watertight doors.

Note the time and enter it into the log.

Clear the bolts from the door!

Heave!

Shut down the boiler!

OFFICER: Captain on the bridge.

We've struck something, 
 Mr. Murdock?

An iceberg, sir.

I hard astarboarded and 
 ran the engines full astern,

but it was too close.

I'm afraid she's hit it.

Dearest God.

I closed the watertight doors,

rung the warning bell.

Sir, do you hear me?

Impossible.

This cannot have happened.

Do you hear what they're saying? 
 We hit an iceberg.

That grinding noise we heard?

Perhaps we lost a propeller.

Good. 
 It gives us more time for bridge.

The boat's stopped cold.

Ah, a few hours, we'll be 
 back on our way again.

Anybody want a souvenir?

Isabella.

Did you see it, the iceberg?

I've done a terrible thing.

What?

I sent Eddie a wireless.

Yes?

I can't give you up.

I won't.

I've told him all about us,

and I've told him I'm going 
 to Bolivia with you.

Bella...

Oh, Bella.

All right.

Calm down.

Show's over, folks.

Come on, let's get back 
 to our bridge game.

After all, this tin tub's unsinkable.

[ crystal shatters ]
