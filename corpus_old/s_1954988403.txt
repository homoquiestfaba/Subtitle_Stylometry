Fell to earth.

The fallen star burned
as an eternal light

And ultimate source
of power,

Which became known
as the viridian flame.

From this flame
emerged two races.

First, the reptilian beasts,
defenders of the flame,

Then the elves,

Each in possession
of an amulet

Containing
the flame's power.

Some resolved
to remain isolated,

Guarding the flame
where it fell,

Deep in the mountains
of northfalia.

Most chose to live
among the humans,

In hope of a better life.

But the humans have begun
to enslave the elves

And exploit their gifts.

There are murmurs
that this is the beginning

Of the great prophecy.

It tells
of a mighty luminary

Who will rise
in an era of great turmoil.

This is where
our story begins.

Guards, this way!

Beasley, I do not see
any deer.

They must have got away.

We wandered over the border
into northfalia.

Let's return.

It's only for sport, sire.

Let us pursue the deer.

No, the beasts
run free here.

It's not safe, nor is it
true to our treaty.

Come.

[Fierce roar,
horse whinnies]

Beasley!

Beasley!

Beasley...


It simply cannot be true.

How is it possible?

It simply cannot be true.

How is it possible?

Much better.

Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

The standing stone,
and the twisted tree.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who is fairest
of them all?

You are, my queen.

Isabella?

Has the prince
of northfalia arrived?

No, madam.

It is quite some distance
from the northfalian throne.

You still refuse to confess

That the flame
is on the prince's land?

As I've said before,

The flame is only
a myth, madam.


Aah!

What is a hunter
from whitevale

Doing on my lands?

Your land?

Oh, I'm very sorry, sire.

I was hunting the beasts
at the order of the queen.

Hunting on northfalian land
is considered an act of war.

Apologies, sir.
It was all innocent.

Go back to your kingdom.

And pull your trousers up,
for heaven's sake.

Yes, sire.

A harmless mistake, sire?

No. It is not a day
since the death of the king,

And already they violate
our peace treaty.

We cannot afford
another war, sire.

I know.

So I must find a way to
make peace with the queen

That is more lasting.

So it is to be
a marriage, then.

Whitevale
covets our land

And we have not
the resources
to fight them off.

It seems beneficial
for both kingdoms.

[Running footsteps]

[Panting breaths]

[Roaring, snarling]


Sire, your leadership
is impressive,

But what of your happiness?

My happiness?

Do you not want to find love,
like your parents did?

I must do what is right
for the kingdom.

Sire?

The queen is waiting.

My queen.

His royal highness,
price Alexander of northfalia.

I am truly sorry
for your loss.

It is indeed
a great loss for us all.

It simply
cannot be true.

How is it possible?

Those awful beasts.

I have sent my men out
to kill them all.

Yes, your highness.

We found one of your men
on the way here

On northfalian land.

That's a dreadful
mistake.

Though, of course, if
you would like our help

Eradicating those beasts
from your land,

You have but to ask.

Thank you, but no.

In my kingdom,
we must live in harmony

With all our creatures.

I'm just so pleased
that the dear king

Had a chance to sign
the peace treaty

Before he died.

And yet,
somehow I wonder

If it will hold...

Without the king himself
here to uphold it.

Perhaps if we were
to consider...

A union
of both our kingdoms.

The audacity.

You dare speak to me
of marriage

While my dear king
lies nearly still warm.

I meant no offense.

Please forgive me.

Sir, I do understand

The reasoning behind
your sudden proposal.

However, I cannot
consider it here...

Not on this day.

Perhaps you would be
our guest here at whitevale

Where we might discuss it
more fully in the coming days.

It would be my pleasure.

Snow white,
princess of whitevale.

Snow, dear,
welcome home.

You are the queen's
daughter?

Step-daughter.

Of course.

It is an honor,
princess.

Well, I'm sure
you must be very tired.

You've had a long trip.

Oh, you've been
traveling? Abroad?

I have been at the convent.

A nun?

No. I have not yet
felt the calling.

Sire, we should retire.

[Door opens]

Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

The standing stone,
and the twisted tree.

Mirror, mirror,
on the wall,

Who is the fairest
of them all?

My queen, you are
full fair, 'tis true,

But there is one
in the kingdom

More fair than you...

Snow white.

It cannot be.

It will not be.

[Night birds calling,
crickets chirp]


[Humming continues]

Oh!

[Laughs quietly]
I'm sorry, princess.

I didn't mean to disturb you.

No. Uh...
I should go.

No, no, no.
Please, you stay. I'll...

How is it I haven't
known you before?

The queen sent me
to a convent

When I was
a little girl.

Soon after
she married my father.

And now
your father's gone,

You must be needed here.

No. The convent
is my home now.

There's nothing
for me here.

The most wonderful thing
about whitevale

Was once the forest.

I would visit often
when I was a little girl.

But now the forest
offers no solace.

It is lonely and barren

Now the queen
has gotten rid of the elves.

My forests
are enchanted still

And home to a great many
elves and beasts.

My mother
used to tell me a story

About the northfalian forest

In which a star
fell from the heavens

And landed deep
in the forest,

Where no human
had ever set foot.

And from that star

Sprang the elves
and all their magic,

As well as the beasts
who guard them.

And that one day
a mighty luminary

Would unite all creatures

For a thousand years
of harmony.

Princess,
I would be delighted

To have you as a guest.

Would you walk with me
tomorrow at noon?

I don't know what to say.

This ring
was my mother's.

I would like you
to have it

As a token
of my great esteem.

Please.

Until we meet again.

Tomorrow at noon.

Awake.

You did such
a brilliant job with the king,

I have another task.

Yes, my queen?

Queen: Snow white.

Is something wrong?

No, my dear,
not yet, thank heavens,

But you've had a very
close call with danger.

I could not help
but note the passion

The young prince
excited in your eyes.

Your father
was so pleased

To have you
at the convent,

And I would feel it
an abandonment

Of my responsibility
to him

If I were to allow you
to squander your virtue

On some fleeting
feelings of lust.

But I would never...

No, my dear...

No, you must do
as you wish.

Not all girls are made
for the convent.

No, uh...

I'm grateful
for your concern.

I shall honor my father
and remain virtuous.

Wonderful.

Let's get you back to
the convent immediately.

Goodbye, dear.

Take her to the
northfalian wildwoods.

Leave her body
for the beasts,

But bring me her heart.

The queen's men.

We'll take a shortcut
through here.

Is this not
the prince's land?

No, miss,
it's just the border.

Through here.

Just a moment.

Um... Perhaps we should
stay on the path.

No, miss, this way's
much, much quicker.

No, I insist.

I would feel much safer.

Well, if you wanna make
this more difficult.

What?

Aah!

Uhh!


Is it done?
Yes.

[Growling and snarling]

[Snarling and barking]

Sire, where are you headed
with such purpose?

I must learn my fate, Hugh.

I'm going to propose
to snow white,

For I cannot imagine

Spending another day
of my life without her.

For love?
But you told me...

Indeed, for love, Hugh.

I'm going to marry for love
and for the kingdom.

Our union
will join our people

And our lands,
it's perfect.

And have you noticed
what a beautiful day it is?

The perfect day
for an engagement.

But what about your
engagement to the queen?

She refused me, Hugh,
thank the heavens,

For the fates
had another in mind for me.

But, sire, it was not
a complete refusal.

My love has been taken.

She's alive.

[Voices,
metal clanging]

Woman: There's
much darkness ahead.

You dare bring
a human in here.

She's injured.

Who is she?

Oh, that's quite deep.
Put her down.

Can you heal her
before Orlando returns?

No. This will
take me some time.

Orlando.

She needs my help,
Orlando.

We do not help humans.

Take her out to the woods
far away from here

And leave her.

But the queen's men
will find her

And they'll try
to kill her again.

The queen's men
tried to kill her,

And yet
you brought her here?

I ought to slice her throat
and be done with it.

She saved
the runt's life.

So this was your doing,
half-human.

Woman: Orlando.

Here, drink this.

As soon as she's recovered,
she will leave.

I want her gone
by sunset.

Isabella,
I have a headache.

I need only tug this amulet
from your throat,

And all your magic
will be mine.

It's amusing, is it not?

Yes, madam.

But your powers
are so meager.

And what good
would taking one more

Of these
elfin flames do me?

No, it is not the power
in these dribs and drabs

That I want.

It is the source...

The flame
from the fallen star.

No matter. It is
on the prince's land.

And when I marry the prince,

It will be mine
for all eternity.

You can go.

Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

The standing stone
and the twisted tree.

Mirror, mirror,
on the wall,

Who is the fairest
of them all?

My queen, you are
still fair, 'tis true,

But snow white
is fairer still than you.

It cannot be.

He showed me her heart.

Bring me the huntsman.

Wally, you must go.

Here. Take this.

But father...

Please leave now,

Or the queen
will kill you as well.

And you must remember

That I did not kill
anybody.

The queen asked it of me.

Kill who?
Run!

Go!

Aah! Aah!

I took her to the north hill
like you said.

And then a green light
blinded me

Just as I was
about to finish her.

A green light
near the north hill?

Please, please,
give me another chance,

And I'll find her
and kill her

For you.

You've had your chance,

And you lied to me
about it.

Finish up here, and then
give him to the dogs.

I prefer to finish
what I started.

Aaaaah!
No! No!

Aah! No! No!

[Dogs snarl and grunt]

[Huntsman screams]

Queen: Be discreet
in your search.

No one must know
she's alive.

Make it look
as though you were there

To kill
the reptilian beasts

As our favor to the prince.

Yes, madam, and how
will we find her?

You'll begin
by asking the elves.

And you do not need
to ask nicely.

Her fever has broken.

[Door opens]

The queen's men
are all over the forest.

They're looking
for a human girl.

Who is she?

This is not
the first time

The queen is after
an innocent.

Still, we must
give her to them.

No, if they
want her dead,

They will not look kindly
on us healing her.

They're headed towards
the greengate woods.

We must warn
our brothers there.

Wait!

Where do you think
you're going?

Out with you?

Or not.

We need you here

To guard the cottage
and look after the girl.

I would not trust
anyone to it but you.

And do not let her
take one step outside

Or I will
cut off your ears.

Aah! Help!

Help! Help!
Please!

Tell us
where she is.

Where's the girl?

I do not know a girl.

Liars. Elves
are all liars.

Where is the girl?

Not at
the queen's guard.

It will be
an act of war.

There is your act of war.

[Sword unsheaths,
arrow whooshes]

[Guard groans]

Hey!

Aah!


Aaaah!

My lord, please.
Come inside.

You must eat.

It's my fault
she's gone, Hugh.

They were beasts
from my forests.

The queen has
taken it upon herself

To eliminate those
creatures now, sire.

You must get hold
of yourself.

You owe it
to your subjects

To marry someone who
will provide benefits

For the entire kingdom.

Please, Hugh,
it is still too fresh.

I cannot consider
such things now.

The widow queen
is a perfect match.

I need some air.

She will not wait
forever.

[Hearth fire crackling]

Where am I?

I have no time to chat.

If I don't get
the mending done,

They call me stupid
and lazy,

And they'll never let me
go out with them.

Sorry. Who are you?

Runt. That's what
everyone calls me.

Oh, I'd much prefer to
call you by your name.

Really?

Well, my given name
is haegthorn.

Oh, a noble
and sturdy plant.

I apologize.

I can't seem
to remember anything.

Leave me to my work.

I'm stuck here
when I should be out

Warning
of the queen's guard.

[Door opens
and closes sharply]

The queen...

Haegthorn?

Haegthorn?

Haegthorn?

Haegthorn?

I must go now.

Where is she?

Have you brought me
my step-daughter?

No, madam.

We have been unable
to locate her as yet.

The elves we have found
claim to know nothing.

They are very tricky,
your highness.

Unleash the dogs.



[Barking and snarling]

The queen's dogs?



Hey!

Hey!

[Dog yelps]

The others
should be satisfied.

Miss?

Miss?


Miss? Miss?

Where are you?

You're not supposed
to leave.

[Thud thud thud]

Miss?

Slowly.

[Thud thud thud]

Run.


Hyah!

Aah!

Yaah!

I finished
the dishes.

Is that the prince
of northfalia?

Notify the queen.

Sire, are you all right?

Come!

No, no. This way.

I must find her.

There.
An elves' dwelling.

Open for prince Alexander.

You have wandered far,
prince.

Kneel before
your prince.

That's enough.

We mean you no harm.

Go.

Perhaps if you tell us
what you seek, my lord.

I'm looking for a girl.

I saw her
not too far from here.

She was with
a runt-sized elf.

There are no humans here.

Snow.

Snow.

I'm sorry.

The prince is now
allied with the queen.

He allows her to roam
freely on his lands.

Soon she will claim
what it is she truly seeks...

The viridian flame.

It will be
the end of us all.

Speak, captain.

Have the dogs found
my step-daughter?

For I am sure you would not
return here without her.

I'm sorry, madam.
We have not.

And the prince ordered
us off his lands.

He no longer
desires your help

In ridding the forest
of the beasts.

Well...

We'll just have to be
a little more discreet.

I do not believe the elves

Are as ignorant in this
matter as they claim.

Kidnap an elf.

Yes, madam.

And, madam, the prince...

He swears he saw snow white
in the forest

With an elf, a runt elf.

He saw her?

I must go to him
at once.

Orlando, what you speak
is madness.

We cannot win in a fight
against the queen.

Our numbers
have dwindled too far.

And yet you would have
them dwindle further.

The dark elves
were right all along.

We never should have
trusted humans.

We should have
remained isolated

As they have.

But Orlando,
the queen

Will not be able
to acquire the flame

Of the fallen star.

The beasts who
guard it will not
allow her near.

The queen will not stop

Until she has the viridian
flame as her own.

And with it,
all our powers...

For all eternity.

Orlando, you will need
permission to go to war,

And the keepers
will not approve it.

They never have.

It has never been
as urgent as this.

Orlando!

So there is a flame
from a fallen star.

As in the legend.

Everyone out, please.
I need to think.

Mara, I must
speak with you.

The prince is a good man.

I cannot imagine that
he would allow the queen

To destroy you
or your homes.

He can help you.

He came here today

Accompanied by
the queen's guard.

He has already
allowed her soldiers

To begin torturing
and killing elves.

Well, then that must be
a misunderstanding.

Please, allow me
to speak with him.

We can prevent
more bloodshed.

And you will what,

Just walk into
his palace

And ask
for an audience?

He will see me.

Who are you?

I am snow white,

Princess of whitevale.

It is
a dangerous mission.

I would not ask it
of an elf

If he does not wish it.

I will go alone, then.

I will go.

[Speaking elvish]

They refused
the call to war.

Only the prince
can help us now.

[Palace guards talking,
indistinct]

Queen: Please do not
talk that way.

It is grief that caused
your vision of snow white.

In fact, I myself
often see my dear king

As though he were
right here with me,

Alive as you are.

But it was so real.

You must not allow
this madness to consume you,

For the good of your realm.

I have decided
that you were correct.

Our union is the best thing
for both of our kingdoms...

And your health.

Stop in the name
of the queen!

Haegthorn:
This way.

Snow white:
We can't outrun them.

This way. Run!

Hey, over here!

Hyah!

Oof!

[Arrow whooshes]

[Ropes whipping]

[Knock on door]

Madam?

We have caught an elf
near your carriage

Outside the prince's
castle this night.

Well done, captain.

He's a little elf,
madam.

As in the prince's vision.

He's unconscious now.

We'll alert you
when he awakes.

You may stay.

[Panting, breathless]

Poor haegthorn.

I am to blame.

Orlando:
Yes, you are.

We must not fight
amongst ourselves.

We should attack.

Gather all the elves
and storm the castle.

Even with all the elves
of the forest,

We could not defeat
the queen's army.

What we need is someone
inside the castle.

If only the runt
or someone

Could tell us
what she's planning.

Wait. Is tomorrow
the new moon?

Yes.

Well, then today's
market day.

Our kind is at risk
of annihilation,

And you want
to go to market?

Isabella will be there making
purchases for the queen.

Perhaps she will be
our informant.

She's on the side
of the queen.

She's not one of us.

We shall try it.

Guard:
Her majesty the queen.

Do not be afraid,
little elf.

We're not going
to hurt you.

I wish only to talk.

Now, I know
you've been keeping company

With my step-daughter
snow white.

No.

Your charms
won't work on me.

I'm an elf, not a man.

Oh, but I do see
a bit of a man in there.

I know you were with her.

You were spotted
by the prince.

You want to tell me.

No...

She's in the cottage,
your highness.

The cottage? Where?

Near swallow pond.

Good little elf.

Keep him alive for now.

I might need more
from him later.

Oh, no.

Forgive me, princess.

Make it strong,
Isabella.

Yes, madam.

I want it
to kill her slowly.

Yes, madam.

Slip it on her finger,

And she will fall
unconscious in moments.

From there,
she shall never awake.

Make this a sapphire.

Perfect.

Now... Turn me into a crone.

Monster.

I feel like the queen
knows you're alive.

Maybe this was
a mistake. Let's go.

Mara, please.

I must speak to Isabella.

Isabella.

You have abandoned
your kind

For the comfort
of the queen's good graces.

Now I implore you.

Will you join with
your brethren to liberate...

The whitevale throne
is one of honor,

And the queen
a person of beauty.

How can you
turn your back on all...

Long live
the good queen.

Orlando, wait.

Rings for sale.

No, thank you.

Oh, but look
how lovely they are.

No...
Look.

Where did...

It was meant just for you...

Snow white.

Goodbye, princess.

Your highness,

New horses
will be delivered tomorrow.

That's fine, Hugh.

I received word.

The wedding will be
in two days' time.

How is she?

Well, the queen...

The horse.

Oh, she's doing fine, sire.

Where did you get that?

Please, sir.
I did nothing wrong.

It was given to me.

Who gave it to you?

My father gave it to me.

How did he get it?

He got it from a girl.

My father
was the queen's huntsman.

She hired him
to kill a girl.

So he killed her?

No. He planned to,
but he did not.

Then she's still alive.

Sire?

We are expected
for dinner.

Where
are you going?

And what shall
I tell her?

Foolishness.

[Torch fire
crackling]

Where is she?

Where is she?
Where is snow white?

You are not welcome.

I know she did not die.

Where is she?

Ah, I'm too late.

I'm truly sorry, my lord.

I'm so sorry.

Her hand.

It moved in mine.

Poison.

This was
the queen's doing.

And she has the runt.
We need to stop her.

We must attack her now

While she still believes
I'll marry her.

How many elves can you
muster for a fight?

Not many. There are not
many free elves left.

I know, but the queen
has many enemies

Across four kingdoms.

With their support, we
shall have a fearsome army.

Good.

Don't get too close
to the queen.

She has ways
of enchanting men

Into doing what she wants.

As she did
with my father.

Her spells
will not work on me.

I only have eyes
for one.

I shall return tomorrow
at daybreak.

Then we strike.

She tried
to take you from me,

But I swear she will
never harm you again,

If you will consent
to be my queen.

Snow... I love you
with all my heart,

And I shall
love you forever.

Will you marry me?

I will.

I must go.

I shall return for you.

Mara:
I sense your worry.

If we are victorious,
you become queen.

If my father
had intended me to rule,

He would have made
arrangements.

War, usurping the throne...

It does not feel correct.

Your father
was a good man,

But he was blinded
by the queen's charms.

What of your mother,
princess?

What did she
intend for you?

I wish I could ask her.

She has already told you

Everything
you need to know.

The story?

Of the fallen star
and the luminary?

It is for you
to find that answer

Within yourself.

A fresh horse for me.

Ready my men.
Prince!

I'm amassing an army
to destroy the queen.

Destroy the queen?

You are to marry her
in one day's time.

No, Hugh.
I shall marry snow white.

Really?

What wonderful news.

But still the queen
awaits you for dinner,

So she will not take
kindly being rejected.

What shall we do?

Yes, the queen
will likely grow suspicious

If I do not appear.

Perhaps you go on
and dine with the queen,

And I shall go
from kingdom to kingdom

To commit the army
to our cause.

Good. It's a fine idea.

You must make sure
they agree.

Our victory depends on it.

His royal highness,
prince Alexander of northfalia.

My queen.

Please forgive
my tardiness.

Of course, dear prince.

It is so good
to see you again.

When Hugh told me
of your delay,

I thought perhaps something
more important had come up.

No, of course not.

To us.

What could possibly be more
important than all of this?

I do not know.

Perhaps going
from town to town

Trying to amass
an army against me?

I'm sorry, my lord,

But it is necessary.

This is treason!

You've done well.

Take him to the dungeon.

Get some beauty sleep,
dear prince.

Tomorrow's
our wedding day.

[Grunting with effort]

It's useless. Trust me.

I am still hoping somebody
might come for me, but...

You're the runt?
Yes.

Yeah. Well, technically
I'm your rescue party.

Daybreak is near.

Let us hope the prince
brings a formidable army.

Queen: Alert me as soon
as the priest arrives.

Unfortunately, I must keep you
alive until after the wedding,

At which point,
my possession of your lands

Becomes completely legal
and legitimate.

I will never
marry you.

Oh, you will.

Don't look into her eyes.

It's a pity, though.

You're a handsome man.

Are you sure
you won't be mine

And rule
side by side forever?

Yes. Yes.

Together. Forever.

That's right.

You are the most
beautiful thing

I've ever laid
my eyes upon.

I have been blind,
my queen.

Please forgive me.

Madam?

Madam?

What?!
Has the priest arrived?

No, madam, but your army
awaits you in the Western yard.

All right.
This may have to wait.

He will come.

The troops are ready to march
on northfalia, madam.

If it's a war they want,
a war we shall give them.

Leave no man nor elf alive.

Female elf:
Who is that?

Isabella!

You have no business
here, traitor.

I will live in fear
of the queen no longer.

The queen's army
is on the march.

You must all flee.
Please!

What of prince Alexander?
Have you seen him?

I'm sorry, my lady,

But he's fallen under
the queen's spell.

He cannot help you now.

I do hear them,
the queen's army.

We must run.

We do not have enough
elves to fight.

I will not flee,

Not before the evil
that faces us now.

We have no choice
but to fight

For our land, for our kind,

For all
that have come before.

We must fight.

If we are to die in battle,
we die with honor.

Are you all right,
princess?

The time for war is upon us.

That was a perfect kiss.

It's almost as if
she had the key

To unlock my heart.

This way.

No, no, no, wait.

Unchain them.

Who here seeks
to overthrow the queen?

I am weak,
but I will fight.

I will do whatever you ask.

As would I.

I cannot promise
we will win,

But we shall certainly
give her one mighty battle.

Have the guards been dispatched
to the north hill?

Yes, madam. They will
acquire the flame.

Pitiful.

Unleash the dogs.

Ready your weapons.

Fire!


[Yelping, whimpering]

Decimate them all.

All but snow white.

Leave her to me.

Aah!

Guard: There they are!
After them!

Aah!

Not long now.

They have come.

The dark elves!

Summon the priest.

[War cries]

[Swords clanging]

[Battle sounds
fade to silence]

Aah!



You chose wrong again,
dear fiance.

Weapons down.

Now!

Good.

Now, thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

Especially you,
my guest of honor.

Summon the priest.

Begin.

Dearly beloved,
we are gathered all together

To join together this man
and woman in holy matrimony.

Prince Alexander,
do you take queen...

He does.

Do you, queen Gwendolyn,

Take prince Alexander
to be your husband,

To love him, comfort him,

And keep him
in sickness and in health

Until death do you part?

I do.

I require
and charge you both

That if either of you know
any impediment

Why ye may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony

That ye confess it.

Bless these two that they may be
ever faithful to one another

And live
and grow old together

And see their children's
children.

As those
that have come before,

So these persons
may surely perform

And keep the vow and covenant
betwixt them made

And may ever
hereafter remain

In perfect love
and peace together.

As you have bravely
and solemnly

Come here
to this place today,

Know that
by all here present

And by your own actions

You have signified
unto our community

That you are worthy
and ready

To care for the person
of your choosing

From this day forward,

To take thy partner's hand

In all things true
and active life

Surpassed only by
a subsequent calling to arms.

You?

Yes, me.

The queen of whitevale.

[Sobbing quietly]

No.

No.

[Groaning quietly]
