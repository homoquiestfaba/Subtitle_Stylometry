[SOUND OF MOVIE REEL RUNNING]

NARRATOR: THEY SAY WALT
DISNEY'S FONDEST MEMORIES

CAME FROM A SMALL TOWN IN
MISSOURI WHERE HE LIVED WITH

HIS FAMILY,

A TOWN CALLED
MARCELINE.


IF YOU ASK ME
NOW WHAT MAKES A MAN

THE PLACE WHERE HE
COMES FROM

RELIGION, HIS FAMILY, AND
HIS FRIENDS

INDEED THESE ALL
MUST PLAY A ROLE

AND MANY
CAN FOR SOME

BUT FOR WALT THERE WAS JUST
ONE IN THE END

MARCELINE, MARCELINE

WHERE THE BEST OF DREAMERS
DREAM

THO YOU'VE GIVEN ME
YOUR BEST

I MUST BE HEADED
WEST

THO I OWE SO MUCH TO
YOU

I MUST DO AS
DREAMERS DO

MY CITY, MY QUEEN,
MARCELINE


MARCELINE, MARCELINE

WHERE THE BEST OF
DREAMERS DREAM

THO YOU'VE GIVEN ME YOUR
BEST

I MUST BE HEADED WEST

THO I OWE SO MUCH TO YOU

I MUST DO AS DREAMERS DO

MY CITY, MY QUEEN,
MARCELINE

NARRATOR: HERE COMES THE

DISNEY FAMILY NOW. YOU SEE,
WALT'S PARENTS, ELIAS AND

FLORA, DECIDED TO BUY A FARM
AND MOVE TO THE COUNTRY

THERE. THEY DIDN'T FEEL SAFE
IN CHICAGO ANYMORE. IT WAS

THE PLACE WHERE WALT WAS
BORN, BUT THE TURN OF THE

CENTURY BROUGHT WITH IT A
RISE IN CRIME. THIS BOY,

NAMED, AFTER THE FAMILY'S
LOCAL PASTOR, WAS UNLIKE

ANYONE AMERICA HAD EVER
SEEN; THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW

IT YET; AND FLORA AND ELIAS
CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW IT,

BUT MOVING THEIR FAMILY TO
THIS LITTLE TOWN IN

MISSOURI, WOULD CHANGE
AMERICAN HISTORY FOREVER.

ELIAS: FIRST AND FOREMOST,
LET'S GIVE THANKS TO GOD FOR

GETTING US HERE SAFE. (AMEN)
ROY, GO TO THE LUGGAGE CART,

GET OUR BAGS AND TRUNKS.
WALT, I NEED YOU TO GO FIND

MR. COFFMAN, HIS HORSE AND
BUGGY.

FLORA, CAN YOU GET

SOME WATER FOR MY CANTEEN
PLEASE?

WALT, WALTER!
WALTER!

NARRATOR: NO ONE
COULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT

WHAT WALT WAS SEEING WOULD
END UP BEING SUCH A BIG

INSPIRATION TO HIM LATER IN
LIFE. WALT'S EYES HAD JUST

WITNESSED THEIR FIRST
GLIMPSE AT WHAT REALLY WAS

MAIN STREET U.S.A.

WALT:
Wow!

ELIAS: WALTER!

YES, SIR. SORRY SIR! YES,
SIR?

ARE YOU READY TO
SEE THE FARM?

YES,
SIR!

ALRIGHT, MY
ABSENT-MINDED SON.

TRY TO
KEEP UP WITH ROY.

ROY: COME ON WALT. THERE'S A MAN
WITH A WAGON HERE TO MEET US.

SEE, PEOPLE ARE REAL NICE
HERE.

WALT: I THINK I'M
GOING TO LIKE IT HERE ROY.

YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
THE FARM YET.

I CAN
ALREADY TELL. IT ALREADY

SMELLS A LOT NICER, PEOPLE
ARE A LOT NICER, AND THE

SKIES ARE A LOT NICER.

COME ON WALT.

NARRATOR: WALT

DISNEY WAS KNOWN TO SAY THAT
MORE THINGS OF IMPORTANCE

HAPPENED TO HIM IN MARCELINE
THAN HAD HAPPENED SINCE OR

WERE LIKELY TO IN THE
FUTURE.

WALT: WHAT DO YOU
THINK, RUTH?

BOY, THIS IS
THE LIFE!

RUTH: LIFE

WALT:
NO, I MEAN, AIN'T IT PRETTY?

RUTH: PRETTY

IT'S NOT THE CITY, GET IT?
THIS HERE'S THE COUNTRY!

COUNTRY

GOLLY! CAN'T
YOU COME UP WITH ANYTHING ON

YOUR OWN?

[SPITTING SOUND]

OH, BROTHER!

SISTER!

NARRATOR: EVEN

THROUGH COLD WINTERS, WALT
WOULD FIND A WAY TO

ENTERTAIN HIMSELF AND HIS
FAMILY. YOU SEE, WALT WAS

INTERESTED IN THE ARTS, AND
ADVENTURES FROM A VERY YOUNG

AGE. AND WELL, IT LOOKS AS
IF HE'S ABOUT TO CREATE HIS

FIRST MASTERPIECE.

WALT:
LOOK, RUTH! PAINT!

RUTH:
HUH?

UH, OH!

DON'T WORRY, RUTH. IT COMES

OFF. IT'S JUST PAINT. ALL WE
NEED NOW IS PAINT BRUSHES.


YEAH, IT'S PERFECT!
I'M GOING TO BE A PAINTER

WHEN I GROW UP.

YEAH!

FLORA: THERE YOU TWO ARE.

OH, MY GOODNESS! WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE?

WE'VE BEEN PAINTING
MAMA, IT'S CALLED ART!

PAINTING!

THIS IS TAR WALTER!

IT ISN'T PAINT! IT DOESN'T COME
OFF.

YOU'VE RUINED THE NEW HOUSE!
RUTH, GO INSIDE NOW! NOW

SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANY
BETTER, BUT YOU, YOU SHOULD!

I'M SORRY MAMA. IT WAS
THERE AND I JUST FIGURED.

WELL, SORRY ISN'T
GOING TO TAKE THE PITCH OFF

THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE NOW IS
Ir?

I THOUGHT YOU'D
LIKE IT.

WE MADE IT FOR YOU
LIKE REAL LIFE PAINTERS.

REAL PAINTERS USE
REAL PAINT, WALT!

I'M
SORRY. I THOUGHT

OH,
WALT! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO

WITH YOU? YOUR IMAGINATION
IS JUST BURSTING AT THE

SEAMS!

I CAN PAINT THE
REST OF THE HOUSE SO IT WILL

MATCH. I THINK IT WILL KIND
OF LOOK NICE.

DON'T

YOU DARE! NOW, WALTER, I
KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN

ANYTHING BY IT, BUT YOUR
GOING TO HAVE TO BE

PUNISHED. I CAN'T LET YOU GO
AROUND GETTING AWAY WITH

THINGS LIKE THIS. YOU
UNDERSTAND?

I'M SORRY,

MAMA. I'M SO SORRY! PLEASE
DON'T PUNISH RUTH. IT WAS MY

FAULT NOT HERS. 1 TOLD HER
IT WOULD WASH OFF. I THOUGHT

IT WAS LIKE REAL PAINT.

WELL, YOU CAN PAINT

THE FENCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
HOW'S THAT?

OK, MAMA,

WITH REAL PAINT THIS
TIME.

JUST LIKE TOM

SAWYER.

NARRATOR: WALT HAD A
BIG HEART FOR A LITTLE KID,

AND IT WAS FILLED WITH
DREAMS. WHY, HE EVEN FOUND A

DREAMING TREE IN MARCELINE.
IT WAS HIS OWN SPECIAL

PLACE, WHERE HE COULD SIT
AND IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF

MAGICAL THINGS. HE WOULD
RETURN TO THIS SPOT

THROUGHOUT HIS ADULT LIFE
FOR REFLECTION, PRAYER, AND

OF COURSE, TO BE INSPIRED.
HE WAS PROUD OF THAT TREE

AND THE DREAMS THAT CAME
FROM IT. AND IF THE DREAMING

TREE WASN'T WORKING OUT FOR
WALT'S AWAKE-DREAMING, IT

SURE CAME IN HANDY AS A SPOT
FOR SOME REAL DREAMING. LIKE

THE SLEEPING KIND.

AUNT
MARGARET: WALTER, WAKE UP

AND SEE WHAT AUNTIE MARGARET
HAS BROUGHT YOU.

WALT:
AUNTIE MARGARET, IS THAT

YOu?

AUNT MARGARET: NO, JUST

A DREAM SILLY!

IF
YOU'RE JUST A DREAM, HAVEN'T

YOU BROUGHT ME SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT?

AM I NOT
PRESENT ENOUGH?

I
SUPPOSE.

WALT, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MY

FAVORITE NEPHEW. HONEST AS
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN. OF

COURSE I HAVE PRESENTS FOR
YOU! LOOK!

ANEW TABLET? NEW ART
SUPPLIES? THE WHOLE LOT?

ALL OF IT!

ALL FOR ME?

YES! BE MY GUEST, HELP
YOURSELF.

OH, THANK
YOU, AUNTIE! THANK YOU!

YOU CAN THANK ME

BY DRAWING ME A PICTURE
WALT. YOU ARE SUCH A GRAND

ARTIST. I'M GOING TO SEE
YOUR WORK IN A MUSEUM ONE

DAY.

WELL, TODAY I
PROMISE DOC SHERWOOD THAT

I'D DRAW RUPERT.

WHO'S RUPERT?

HIS HORSE

I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
TO START SOMEWHERE.

MAYBE
AFTERWARDS YOU CAN DRAW A

PICTURE FOR ME TOO? BUT ONLY
IF YOU HAVE ALL YOUR CHORES

DONE FIRST, ALRIGHT?

RIGHT AFTER I GET DONE WITH
RUPERT.

LOOK, THERE HE IS
NOW WITH DOC.

WELL, RUN ALONG.

THANK
YOU AUNT MARGARET!

DID IJUsT
GET SNUBBED FOR A HORSE?

DOC: SORRY, DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN STILL DRAW HIM WHILE HE'S

ACTING THIS WAY? PERHAPS
HE'S JUST BEING SHY OR

SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE ALMOST GOT IT I
THINK.

DOC: SAY, WALTER,
HOW'S YOUR FATHER FEELING

THESE DAYS? I'VE HEARD THAT
HE'S BEEN ILL.

WELL, HE'S DOING PRETTY AWFUL,
DOC.

DOC: OH, SORRY TO HEAR

THAT WALTER. SHOULD I PAY
HIM A VISIT YOU THINK?

WALT: NO, NO, SIR! IF HE EVEN
FINDS OUT THAT I WAS TALKING

ABOUT HIM, PLEASE DON'T DOC.
MOM SAYS IT'S JUST STRESS

THAT'S DONE IT TO HIM. HE'S
MADE HIMSELF SICK BY WORRY

SO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING. I
THINK IT'S JUST THE WEATHER

OR ATLEAST THAT'S WHAT AUNT
MARGARET SAYS.

DOC: WELL, EITHER WAY, IT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE. HE'S GOT A

BIG FARM TO TEND. WELL, JUST
MAKING ENDS MEET, SEEMS LIKE

HE MAY HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.

WALT: OH, NO SIR! WE ALL

LOVE THE FARM. HECK! WHAT
WOULD MARCELINE BE WITHOUT

WALT DISNEY! RIGHT DOC?

DOC:
WELL, IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T

BE AS COLORFUL. BUT, WELL,
AS MUCH AS RUPERT AND I

WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU GO,
WELL, SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU

HAVE TO GIVE UP THINGS YOU
LOVE. IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO

MOVE ON.

WALT: I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE DOC. THIS HERE'S MY

HOME!

DOC: WELL, HOME IS
WHERE THE HEART IS AS THEY

SAY, WALTER.

WELL, MY
HEART IS IN MARCELINE!

I KNOW THAT, WALTER. I
KNOW. BUT WELL, PERHAPS

YOU SHOULD
BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT

EXCUSE ME, SIR. I HATE TO BE

SHORT WITH YOU BUT I'VE GOT
OTHER PICTURES TO GET TO.

HERE WE GO! ALL DONE!

I
LOVE IT! IT'S MAGNIFICENT!

WHAT A TALENTED YOUNG MAN
YOU ARE, WALTER!

GEE,
THANKS DOC!

IT WASN'T EASY
WITH RUPERT DANCING THE

WHOLE TIME. IT WAS FUN,
THOUGH, TRYING TO GET HIM ON

PAPER. WITH THE WAY HE
MOVED,

WELL, BEING STILL
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EASY.

WELL, IT'S EXCEPTIONAL!

I'D LIKE TO FRAME IT AND PUT
IT IN MY HOUSE.

REALLY?

YES, REALLY!
OH, NOW, HERE'S A NICKEL.

NOW I THINK THAT'S A FAIR
EXCHANGE IF YOU'LL AGREE, OF

COURSE.

WOW! DOC, 1
WOULDA JUST GIVEN IT TO YOU.

NEVER GIVE YOUR ART
AWAY, WALT! NO, NO, TALENT

LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE PAID
FOR. WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN A

PATIENT FOR FREE NOW HAVE I?

NO, I GUESS NOT.

EXACTLY. SO IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A REAL ARTIST, YOU'RE

GOING TO HAVE TO CHARGE FOR
YOUR WORK.

TO
EVERYBODY? EVEN MY MOM?

WELL, NOT EVERYONE, BUT THE

GENERAL PUBLIC, YEAH.

OK. THEN MAYBE JUST MY DAD.


OH, AND
WALTER! IF YOU'RE GOING TO

BE A REAL ARTIST, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE

MARCELINE EVENTUALLY. I
MEAN, REAL ARTISTS NEED

ADVENTURE IN THEIR LIVES.
IT'S INSPIRATION FOR THEIR

WORK, YOU SEE.

I GUESS
SO.

YOU NEED TO SEE NEW

THINGS, MEET NEW PEOPLE, NEW
HORSES EVEN.

FILL YOUR MIND
FULL OF FRESH CREATIVITY.

WHY, YOU NEED TO DO THAT,
THOUGH, AWAY FROM MARCELINE.

ARTISTS OF TODAY ARE IN NEW

YORK CITY OR MAYBE EVEN
FRANCE!

WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M JUST HAPPY
DRAWING RUPERT.

AN ARTIST GOESWHERE THE WIND
BLOWS, WALTER.

I'LL THINK
ABOUT THAT DOC.

I BETTER GET
HOME FOR DINNER SO I CAN

DRAW AUNTIE MARGARET'S
PICTURE FIRST AND I'M AWFUL

GRATEFUL FOR THE NICKEL,
DOC.

I'LL REMEMBER THIS
FOREVER!

THANK YOU!

OH, YOU'RE VERY
WELCOME, WALTER!

AND WHENEVER I LOOK AT THIS
PICTURE, I'LL THINK OF YOU.

WELL, GOODBYE NOW, SON.

AUNT MARGARET: WELL, THE
YOUNG ARTIST RETURNS.

LOOK,
AUNTIE MARGARET, I MADE A

WHOLE NICKEL. I SOLD MY
FIRST ARTWORK.

OF A HORSE?

YEAH, AND IT
KEPT DANCING

AROUND LIKE HE WAS DOING THE
FOX TROT TOO!

WALTER, YOU AMAZE ME MORE
EVERY DAY! YOU SOLD YOUR

FIRST SKETCH? YOU ARE A REAL
ARTIST NOW!

WELL, NOT

REAL, REAL. I'M STILL JUST A
KID. I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

I'M OLDER.

WELL, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT

TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? AN
ARTIST?

WELL, YEAH?

BUT I WANT TO BE SOMETHING
MORE.

LIKE
WHAT?

THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES?

WELL, NOT LIKE PRESIDENT IN
POLITICS. I WANT TO HAVE THE

POWER TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S
LIVES SOMEHOW.

WELL, ART CHANGES
PEOPLE'S LIVES, WALTER.

HOW?

ART HAS POWER! IT HAS THE

POWER TO MAKE US HAPPY OR
SAD.

IT HAS THE POWER TO HELP US
SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

OR, WE SEE
SOMETHING AND WE FEEL IT TOO

AND IT HELPS US KNOW WE'RE

NOT ALONE. ART CAN CHALLENGE
PEOPLE. IT CAN CHANGE

PEOPLE.

WOW! THAT'S
WHAT I WANT TO DO!

WELL, YOU ARE OFF
TO A MAGNIFICENT START.

AND IF I CAN GET PAID
TODO IT,

WELL,

DOC SAID I SHOULDN'T GIVE AWAY
MY ART FOR FREE.

WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO
YOUR HEART ON THAT ONE, BUT

YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR
STOMACH TOO, BECAUSE A MAN

HAS TO EAT AND IT TAKES
MONEY TO BUY FOOD.

SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE HAD
BETTER HEAD IN FOR DINNER

BEFORE YOUR DAD SENDS OUT A
SEARCH PARTY.

YEAH. AND
AUNTIE MARGARET?

YES?

THESE
ARE FOR YOU.

WALT, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL!

THEY LOOK SO REAL I CAN
ALMOST SMELL THEM,

THANK
You!

NO, THANK YOU
AUNTIE MARGARET.

FOR WHAT?

YOU'RE THE ONLY ADULT THAT

TALKS TO ME LIKE I'M A REAL
PERSON.

WELL,
YOU ARE A REAL PERSON.

I THINK? I MEAN, AREN'T YOU?

OF COURSE I AM.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AUNTIE
MARGARET.

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

WE ARE
KINDRED SPIRITS.

YES.
KINDRED SPIRITS!

NARRATOR:
AND IF THERE WAS ANOTHER

ADULT WALT
ENJOYED BEING AROUND AS MUCH

AS HIS AUNTIE MARGARET, IT
WAS HIS UNCLE MIKE, THE

STEAM TRAIN ENGINEER.

EVER
SINCE HE TOOK THAT FIRST

TRAIN RIDE WHEN HE ARRIVED
AT THE STATION IN MARCELINE,

HE WAS HOOKED. HE EVEN SAID
HIMSELF THAT ONE OF THE

PRIDES OF HIS LIFE WAS HIS
UNCLE MIKE MARTIN, WHO WAS

AN ENGINEER ON A TRAIN
RUNNING FROM MARCELINE TO

FORT MADISON, IOWA.

AFTER
ALL,

IF YOU CAN'T BE AN
ENGINEER YOURSELF,

THE NEXT BEST THING IS TO
HAVE A RELATIVE WHO'S ONE.

AND YOUNG WALT WAS
EXPECTING HIM ANY MINUTE.

SAY, THERE, GUY! WHAT'CHA DOIN'
ON THE TRACKS?

DON'T YOU KNOW
THERE'S A TRAIN COMING?

WHY, SURE I DO,
MISTER!

THAT TRAIN COMING IS
ENGINEERED

BY MY VERY OWN UNCLE,

MR. MIKE MARTIN!

IS THAT SO?

SURE IS.
WAIT AND SEE.

WELL, COULD YOU WAIT AND SEE
FROM UP HERE?

YOU'RE MAKING ME A

BUNDLE OF NERVES SITTING ON
THE TRACK LIKE THAT.

IDON'T

WANT TO END UP IN THE
MARCELINE HERALD AS THE

MAN WHO IGNORES
TRACK-NAPPING KID

JUST BEFORE HE WAS
SQUISHED.

AH, SHUCKS,
MISTER. I'M JUST LISTENING

FOR THE TRAIN IS ALL.

LISTENING FOR THE TRAIN?

AIN'T THAT WHY A TRAIN BLOWS
ITS WHISTLE?

GOSH, MR!
HAVEN'T YOU EVER LISTENED

FOR THE VIBRATIONS ON A
TRACK?

YOU CAN HEAR A TRAIN
COMING FOR MILES AWAY.

NO FOOLIN', HUH?

YOU
WANNA TRY?

WELL, GOLLY, YOU
AREN'T AFRAID ARE YOU?

WHO ME?

NO, I'M NOT AFRAID!

I'VE BEEN MEANING TO BRUSH
UP ON MY TRAIN VIBRATION

STUDIES.

LIKE THIS?

I DON'T
HEAR ANYTHING.

PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE.

I HEAR SOMETHING.

THAT'S
MY UNCLE MIKE!

WOW! THAT REALLY IS A SWELL
TRICK.

I'M REAL PROUD
OF YOU MISTER.

AW,
SHUCKS!

THANKS KID.

NOW I'LL
ALWAYS KNOW IF THE TRAINS

ARE RUNNING ON TIME.

MISTER?

WHAT'S THAT
KID?

YOU MIGHT WANT TO
SKEDADDLE.

[TRAIN WHISTLE!]

[SOUND OF TRAIN PASSING[

NARRATOR: WALT'S LOVE FOR
TRAINS WAS ONLY RIVALED BY

HIS LOVE FOR COMMUNITY IN
MARCELINE.

THERE WAS NO

DOUBT THAT WALT FELT A SENSE
OF SUPPORT FROM HIS

RELATIVES.

HIS FATHER,
ELIAS,

MAY NOT HAVE EVER
FULLY UNDERSTOOD HIS SON,

BUT HE WOULD RELUCTANTLY
SUPPORT WALT.

AND YOU SEE,

MARCELINE WAS A PLACE WHERE
PEOPLE HELPED EACH OTHER.

ONE OF WALT'S FAVORITE

MEMORIES OF SUCH A TIME WAS
THRESHING SEASON.

A STEAM

ENGINE WOULD PULL A TRAIN OF
WAGONS THROUGHOUT THE FIELDS

AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD
GATHER AROUND TO BE OF

SERVICE.

THEY WERE GOOD,
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE

HELPING ONE
ANOTHER SURVIVE.

AS WALT
WOULD LATER PUT IT,

I BELIEVE FIRMLY IN THE
EFFICACY OF RELIGION,

IN ITS POWERFUL INFLUENCE
ON A PERSON'S WHOLE LIFE.

IT
HELPS IMMEASURABLY

TO MEET THE STORMS AND
STRESSES OF LIFE

AND KEEP YOU ATUNED TO
DIVINE INSPIRATION.

WITHOUT INSPIRATION, WE
WOULD PERISH.

ALL I ASK OF MYSELF,

"LIVE A GOOD, CHRISTIAN
LIFE".

AND SO HE DID.

HE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
HOW TO LIVE,

ABOUT HIS OWN
CHARACTER,

ALL FROM
MARCELINE AND THE PEOPLE

THAT LIVED THERE.

AND HE
WOULD KEEP THOSE QUALITIES

IN HIS HEART

TO FOREVER BE A
PART OF HIM.

WALT SURE WISHED THAT THINGS
NEVER HAD TO CHANGE.

HE WISHED IT MORE
THAN ANYTHING.

BUT HE KNEW
DOC SHERWOOD WAS RIGHT;

SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THINGS UP.

AND AS MUCH AS HE
DIDN'T WANT TO,

HE COULD
TELL THAT CHANGE WAS COMING.

AND HE KNEW THEIR LIFE IN
MARCELINE COULDN'T LAST

FOREVER, EXCEPT FOR IN HIS
HEART, OF COURSE. NOBODY

COULD EVER TAKE THAT FROM
HIM. BUT IT WOULDN'T BE LONG

BEFORE FLORA MADE THE
DECISION TO SELL THE FARM

AND MOVE INTO TOWN. NOW,
SURE, THE TOWN WASN'T FAR,

BUT TO WALT

IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN A
WHOLE WORLD AWAY.

ONCE HE GOT A TASTE OF
THAT COUNTRY LIFE,

BOY, HE
DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP.

BUT SOON, THERE WOULDN'T BE
A CHOICE.

WALT: ROY?

ROY:
YEAH?

WALT: WHY DO YOU THINK

DAD'S HAVING US POLISH THIS
STUFF NOW? THE FARMING

SEASON IS OVER AND IT'S JUST
GOING TO GET ALL DUSTY

AGAIN. SO WHY?

ROY: COME ON,
WALT! YOU KNOW WHY.

YEAH, I GUESS 1 JUST WANTED
TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE

WHO'D TELL IT TO ME
STRAIGHT.

JUST AS LONG
AS WE'RE TOGETHER

IT WILL BE
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

IT'LL BE DIFFERENT, ROY, AND
YOU KNOW IT.

GOSH! I'M
ONLY TRYING TO CHEER YOU UP.

AND I MEANT IT, MOST OF IT
ANYWAY.

WE MAY NOT BE HERE
ON THE FARM

BUT WE'LL STILL
HAVE EACH OTHER.

IT'S JUST
TIME TO MOVE ON, IS ALL.

BUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS
AHEAD OF US.

IT'S TIME TO GET OFF
THIS FARM.

YOU WANT TO
LEAVE MARCELINE?

DOESN'T ANYTHING MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, WALT?

ELIAS: WALTER, WHAT'S THIS I
HEAR ABOUT YOU FEELIN' BAD?

WALY: 1 JUST DON'T

ELIAS: DON'T
WHAT?

ROY: HE WANTS TO STAY.

I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

BOYS, I'M SORRY, BUT IN THIS

HOUSEHOLD WE'VE GOT TO GO
WHEREVER WE CAN MAKE A

BETTER LIFE FOR OURSELVES,

NOT WHEREVER WE CAN
DRAW THE BEST BARN CAT.

NOW HOW'S THE
POLISHING COMING?

IT WILL BE
A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH

IF THIS ISN'T READY FOR THE
AUCTION TOMORROW.

AUCTION! TOMORROW?

YEAH, AUCTION! WHAT DID YOU
THINK?

WE'RE GOING TO PULL
THIS STUFF BEHIND THE WAGON?

TAKE IT TO THE NEW HOUSE? IT

WOULD LOOK REAL GOOD, NOW,
SITTING THERE ON THE STREET,

NOW WOULDN'T
Ir?

OH, DAD, HE DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

WELL, YOU'RENOT THE ONLY ONE
LOSING SOMETHING HERE.

I'VE WORKED
HARD FOR THIS.

ALL OF THIS.

WE KNOW YOU DID, DAD.

BOYS, MAKE YOURSELVES

USEFUL. GO INTO TOWN AND
HANG THESE SIGNS UP AND I'LL

WORK EVEN HARDER CLEANING UP
THE FARM EQUIPMENT. HERE,

YOU'RE FINISHED.

WE CAN
DO BOTH, DAD.

NO! JUST GET IT DONE. GO INTO
TOWN AND GET IT DONE!

WE'LL BE BACK.

BOYS!
LISTEN, MAKE SURE YOU'RE

HOME IN TIME FOR DINNER.

YOUR MOM'S MAKING SOMETHING

REALLY NICE AND IT WOULD
GREAT TO BE TOGETHER AS A

FAMILY.

WE'RE ALL
HURTING IN OUR OWN WAY.

DAD
DOESN'T ALWAYS SHOW IT

BUT HE'S HURTING AND HE CARES
THAT WE'RE HURTING TOO.

I DON'T KNOW.
ROY:

YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU
GET OLDER.

IF THAT'S
GETTING OLDER,

I DON'T EVER
WANT TO GET OLDER.

YOU
CAN'T HELP GROWING UP.

WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
ABOUT THAT.

OH, YEAH?

HAVE SOME IDEAS!

EVER HEARD OF THE FOUNTAIN
OF YOUTH? I READ ABOUT IT

ONCE IN AN ADVENTURE BOOK.

OH, WALT!

IT'S
REAL I TELL YOU!

NARRATOR:
IT WAS A SAD DAY, INDEED.

EVERYTHING WALT HAD COME TO
KNOW WAS CHANGING AND WOULD

JUST KEEP ON CHANGING, AS
LIFE HAS A TENDENCY TO DO.

BUT HE HAD ROY. AND AT LEAST
ROY COULD NOT ONLY SUPPORT,

BUT ENJOY WALT'S
IMAGINATION.

THE FAMILY

MOVED INTO A SMALL HOUSE IN
TOWN WHERE ELIAS COULD GET

BETTER WHILE WALT, ROY, AND
RUTH WOULD FINISH SCHOOL.

WALT ACTUALLY ENJOYED THAT
HOUSE, IT WAS COZY AND THE

FAMILY WAS ALWAYS TOGETHER;
THAT, HE COULD GET USED TO.

SCHOOL WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY
THING THAT REMAINED THE

SAME.

EVEN MARCELINE WAS
A'CHANGIN', STREETS WERE

PAVED NOW, THERE WERE
AUTOMOBILES, A BIG OL' MOVIE

THEATER, AND JUST BEFORE THE
FAMILY LEFT, THERE WERE REAL

ELECTRIC STREET LIGHTS.
WALT'S SMALL TOWN HAD BECOME

A CITY WITHIN ITSELF. YA
SEE, NOTHING IS REALLY

IMMUNE TO CHANGE.

BUT IN
WALT'S HEART IT WAS.

HE WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER
MARCELINE IN HIS OWN WAY.

YEARS LATER, IN A MEETING,
HE SPOKE OF IT FONDLY,

SAYIN', "THAT'S WHAT IT IS A
FEELING OF FREEDOM WITH THE

ANIMALS AND CHARACTERS THAT
LIVE OUT THERE.

THAT IS WHAT
YOU EXPERIENCE

WHEN YOU GO
OUT INTO THE COUNTRY.

YOU
ESCAPE THE EVERYDAY WORLD,

THE STRIFE AND STRUGGLE.

YOUGET OUT WHERE EVERYTHING
IS FREE AND BEAUTIFUL."

AND SO
IT REMAINED TO HIM.

AND HE
HELD ONTO THAT DREAM,

THAT
PLACE WHERE HE ONCE LIVED

THAT HE WOULD NEVER FORGET,

ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DISNEY
FAMILY LEFT MARCELINE FOR

GOOD.

WHEN ELIAS WAS WELL
ENOUGH, THEY WERE OFF TO

KANSAS CITY, ANOTHER
ADVENTURE.

[SOUND OF SOMEBODY WALKING
UP STAIRS]

ELIAS: BOYS! LISTEN UP, I HAVE A
JOB FOR US.

ROY: WHAT IS IT?

WALT:
YEAH, DAD, WHAT IS IT?

WELL, IT'S A PAPER
ROUTE.

A PAPER ROUTE?
THAT'S A KIDS JOB.

IT'S ANYBODY'S JOB AS LONG
AS IT PAYS MONEY, WALTER.

ROY: WHAT'S IT PAY?

ELIAS:
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT, MY

INDUSTRIOUS SON. THIS JOB,
IT PAYS $3 A CUSTOMER.

HOW MANY CUSTOMERS?


ON FOOT?

YES, ON FOOT!

HOW MANY
BLOCKS?

20 SQUARE
BLOCKS

SAY, DAD,
DON'T WANT TO GUM UP THE

WORKS HERE OR NOTHIN', BUT I
CAN'T CARRY 1/3 OF 650

PAPERS, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS AND I'M SURE I

CAN'T CARRY IT.

WELL, THAT'S WHY I GOT US
CARTS, WALTER.

SO HOW MUCH
WILL WE GET PAID?

YOU, ROY, WILL BE MAKING A
STIPEND. WALT, HERE, WILL BE

MAKING AN ALLOWANCE. AND
I'LL BE INVESTING WALTER'S

ALLOWANCE FOR HIM.

SAY! WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
INVESTMENT?

THAT'S NOT
MONEY!

IT'S BETTER THAN MONEY FOR YOU,
WALT. TRUST ME.

WELL, THAT'S
IN INTERESTING IDEA, DAD,

BUT I'D RATHER TAKE THE
MONEY INSTEAD, PLEASE.

WALTER

WELL, I'M SURE
YOU WOULD, WALTER,

BUT
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

YOU WILL LISTEN TO WHAT I'M
GOING TO SAY.

I'LL BE
INVESTING THE MONEY.

I DON'T
NEED YOU WASTING ALL THIS

MONEY ON FRIVOLOUS THINGS,

LIKE, TOYS AND CANDY AND ART
SUPPLIES.

BUT

NO BUTS. LISTEN, WE START AT
3:30 IN THE MORNING.

BUT I HAVE SCHOOL!

WELL, THEN YOU BETTER GET UP
IN TIME TO GET YOUR PAPER

ROUTE FINISHED BEFORE SCHOOL
STARTS OR YOU'RE GOING TO GO

HUNGRY.

BUT I

NO MORE BUTS! LIGHTS OUT!

3:30 IN THE MORNING

3:30

GOSH! IF IT WASN'T BAD

ENOUGH THAT HE WAS MAKING ME
WORK WITH NO PAY, TO ADD TO

INSULT AND INJURY, HE
COMPARED MY ART SUPPLIES TO

CANDY AND TOYS.

ROY: OH,
COME ON! HE'LL PROBABLY USE

YOUR MONEY TO BUY MORE
SHARES OF THE O-ZELL

COMPANY. HECK, MAYBE HE'LL
RUN THE PLACE ONE DAY THEN

YOU CAN WORK FROM THERE.

WALT: I DON'T CARE ABOUT

NONE OF THAT STUFF! I WANT
TO BE AN ARTIST. SEE, I'VE

BEEN DRAWING ALL MY LIFE.

WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

YOU SAY THAT LIKE
YOU'RE 1,000 YEARS OLD.

I'VE GOT AS MUCH OF A
CHANCE AS ANYBODY!

LET'S JUST TRY OUT THIS
PAPER ROUTE THING, OK?

IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO
STOP DRAWING.

OK

AND I CAN ALWAYS BUY YOU
CANDIES AND TOYS WITH MY

MONEY.

I DON'T WANT
YOU GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE

STORE ON MY ACCOUNT, ROY.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD
AND GIVE ME THE MONEY?

GOOD NIGHT, WALT!

GOOD
NIGHT.

AND ROY, THANKS!


ELIAS: WALTER, YOU SHOULD BE
WORKING!

BERT: ARE YOU
WALT'S POP?

ELIAS: YES, I'M

ELIAS DISNEY.

BERT: VERY
PLEASED TO MEET YOU, SIR.

VERY, PLEASED

I'M BERT
HUDSON. I OWN THE JOINT.

WALT IS AN EXTREMELY
TALENTED KID! JUST LOOK AT

ALL THE PEOPLE LINED UP TO
SEE HIS LATEST MASTERPIECE!

YES, I SEE.



BERT:
IT'S A SLOW DAY.

WELL, HE SHOULD BE WORKING.

OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THAT MR. DISNEY,

I PAY HIM
ALRIGHT.

HE GETS A FREE
HAIRCUT WITH EVERY PICTURE.

AND WHEN HE DOESN'T NEED A
TRIM,

I PAY HIM .15 FOR EACH
WORK OF ART.


OH, YOU BET'CHA! I
FRAME THEM RIGHT HERE.

I CAN'T GET HIM TO DRAW FAST
ENOUGH.

YOUR SON IS A HIT!

ARIT?

WALTER, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME ABOUT THIS?

I MEANT TO,

1 JUST DIDN'T GET THE
CHANCE YET.

WELL, HE
CERTAINLY WASN'T HIDING IT

OUT OF SHAME.

THIS IS THE
KIND OF THING A PARENT

BOASTS AND BEAMS ABOUT.

YOUR SON IS A STAR IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.

ALL
FINISHED, BERT.

HOPE YOU
LIKE IT.

OH, IT'S A

TREMENDOUS DRAWING



OSCAR: C'EST MANNEQUIN,
MASTER DISNEY!

GIN: INDEED, WALTER!
WHAT HE SAID!

WHAT DID YOU
SAY?

OSCAR: T HAVE NO IDEA.
1 JUST FELT THAT YOUNG

MASTER DISNEY DESERVED A
COMPLIMENT IN DIFFERENT

LANGUAGE.

I HAVE NO SURE
WHAT LANGUAGE IT WAS.

WALT:
THANKS, OSCAR! THANKS, GIN!

ELIAS: WALTER, DID YOU JUST

CALL THIS MAN GIN"?

NO, NO, NO! NOT â€˜GIN',

PERHAPS YOU HEARD YOUNG
WALTER SAY JIM.

OR TIM

OR TOM.

ALTHOUGH, GIN WOULD BE BEST.

I THINK SO. BUT ONLY
IF IT WAS THE TINIEST DROP

IN A TALL GLASS OF TONIC
WATER, BEING SIPPED IN FRONT

OF A SUPER, BELLA

FRAGILE, MYSTIC; SPECIALLY

ALL FEROCIOUS.

WALT
DISNEY ILLUSTRATION!!!

GIN:
EXACTLY! NOTHING BETTER!

SEE, YOUNG MASTER
DISNEY,

YOUR WORK IS UNFIT
FOR PLAIN OLD WORDS.

SOMEDAY PEOPLE WILL STARE AT
YOUR WORK AND JUST NOT HAVE

WORDS, SO THEY'LL INVENT
THEM. OR YOU WILL. BECAUSE

YOU'RE THAT GOOD.

ELIAS:
WALTER, PLEASE. DON'T

ENCOURAGE THEM.

GIN: OH, WE
DON'T NEED ANY

ENCOURAGEMENT. WE'VE GOT
ENOUGH MOTIVATIONAL

OOOMPH,

1 YES, WE'VE GOT
ENOUGH MOTIVATIONAL OOMPH OF

OUR OWN. JUST LIKE WALT
HERE!

MOTIVATIONAL
OOMPH. I LIKE SOUND OF THAT.

SEE? JUST BEING

AROUND YOU MAKES PEOPLE MORE
OOMPHFUL.

OK. EXCUSE
US GUYS. WE HAVE TO GO.

DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE TO DO?

WHY RUIN A
MOMENTOUS TIME?

I'M SORRY, SIR. I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

WE'VE KNOWN

YOUNG MASTER DISNEY SINCE
THE BEGINNING.

I DON'T THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND

I AM YOUNG MASTER WALT'S
FATHER

AND I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH HIM BY MYSELF IF YOU

DON'T MIND.

HIS FATHER,
HUH?

GUESS THAT KIND OF
TRUMPS OUR STANDING

WITH
WALTER, NOW DOESN'T IT?

WELL, WE'LL ALWAYS BE
OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW LOOKING

AT YOUR ART, UNLESS NATURE
CALLS.

OR UNLESS WE'RE LOOKING AT
YOUR ART IN A MUSEUM.

BUT IT WOULD
BE HIS MUSEUM, OF COURSE,

THE DISNEY MUSEUM.

HE WOULDN'T SHARE IT WITH
ANYONE.

WALTER, YOU ARE
A TRUE VISIONARTISARY!

AURESERVOIR, YOUNG
MASTER DISNEY!

HERE, I MADE A DRAWING
FOR YOU.

THANKS YOUNG MASTER DISNEY!

WELL, DO YOU GUYS LIKE
Ir?

(I COULD HAVE DONE
BETTER)

THOSE GUYS ARE
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH?

LISTEN WALT, YOU DON'T NEED

TO BE SPENDING TIME WITH
FOLKS LIKE THAT.

YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON
YOUR WORK AND YOUR TALENT.

YOU THINK
I'M TALENTED?

THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
THINKS YOU'RE TALENTED, WALT.

AND NOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING
PAID FOR YOUR SKILLS,

YOU SHOULD
INVEST YOUR EARNINGS.

AW, DAD

NOW WAIT A
SECOND.

GIVE ME A CHANCE TO
SAY SOMETHING GOOD HERE.

SORRY, DAD.

YOU COULD INVEST YOUR
EARNINGS IN ART LESSONS.

THEY TEACH AT THE KANSAS
CITY ART INSTITUTE!

WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE
BECOMING AN ARTIST

YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO
IT

BUT DON'T EVER THINK THAT
YOU'RE THE BEST.

YOU CAN
ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING.

YOU
CAN ALWAYS GET BETTER.

DO
YOU UNDERSTAND?

YES,
DAD!

THANK YOU! I'M GOING TO
GO RUN HOME AND TELL ROY.

MEET YOU THERE!

OKAY,
THEN.

AND, DAD?

YES?

I'M GLAD YOU
HAPPENED BY.

ME, TOO,
SON. ME, TOO.

[SOUND OF DOOR FLYING OPEN]

WALT: ROY!
WHERE ARE YOU?

ROY!

I'VE GOT IDEAS, ROY!

ROY!

I'VE GOT AN IDEA

ROY: NOT
AGAIN.

NO, NO LOOK AT
THIS.

ALRIGHT.

LOOKS
NICE.

IT'S ELECTRIC
PARK,

IT HAS GAMES, IT HAS
RIDES. IT HAS EVERYTHING!

SO, WHAT'S THE IDEA?

WE OPEN UP OUR OWN
ELECTRIC PARK. OK?

FORGET ABOUT GOING TO
CHICAGO WITH MOM AND DAD.

ACTUALLY, WALT, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO

TALK TO YA ABOUT SOMETHING.

NO, NO, LOOK, LOOK.

THIS PLACE IS PRETTY GREAT,
YOU KNOW.

IT HAS STAGE
SHOWS, LOG RIDES,

ALOT OF
LIGHTS,

BUT IT'S MISSING
SOMETHING.

IT'S MISSING
SOMETHING.

IT'S MISSING IMAGINATION. IT'S
MISSING US!

I DREW IT ALL OUT RIGHT
HERE.

WE CAN OPEN UP OUR OWN
PARK:

A DISNEY PARK!

NO ONE IS GOING TO COME TO A
DISNEY PARK.

YES, THEY
WILL! LOOK!

I DREW A LAYOUT
RIGHT HERE.

HEY, HEY,
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

LET ME
SPEAK. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

WELL, THIS SOUNDS
SERIOUS.

SURE IT IS.

I'M GONNA BE LEAVING IN A
FEW WEEKS.

WHAT? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?

I JOINED THE
NAVY.

WITH OUR COUNTRY AT
WAR, I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND

AND DO NOTHING WHEN I KNOW
I'M ABLE TO HELP.

WHAT
ABOUT ME?

THIS IS FOR
YOU.

THIS IS FOR YOU AND

EVERY OTHER AMERICAN IN THIS
COUNTRY.

I'M DOING THIS SO

THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO
LIVE A SAFE AND FREE LIFE.

DON'T YOU GET IT?

WALT: NO!
I DON'T GET IT.

I NEED YOU
HERE, ROY.

WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITHOUT YA?

COME
ON, WALT,

LOOK AT YOU!
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

YOU'RE
GETTING PAID TO DRAW,

YOU'RE
TAKING ART CLASSES.

YOU'RE A
SWELL KID ALL ON YOUR OWN.

YOU DON'T NEED ME.

YEAH, I DO, ROY! YEAH, I DO
NEED Y OU. YOU'RE MY FAMILY!

AND I WILL STILL BE
YOUR FAMILY NO MATTER WHERE

I AM. I'M YOUR BROTHER
WHETHER I'M SITTING NEXT TO

YOU OR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WORLD.

HEY, LET ME PUT
IT TO YOU THIS WAY.

I NEED
AN ADVENTURE.

A REAL
ADVENTURE;

THE KIND YOU READ
ABOUT IN HISTORY BOOKS,

THE KIND THAT TAKES YOU TO
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

WORLD, TO SEE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, DIFFERENT PLACES.

AND THIS IS AONCE IN A
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

TO HAVE THAT ADVENTURE

I NEED YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

YEAH, YEAH, I GET IT.
I GET THAT YOU'RE THE

BRAVEST PERSON I KNOW.
YOU'RE THE BEST BROTHER A

GUY COULD ASK FOR.

AND
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

AROUND HERE THAT UNDERSTAND
ME

AND SUPPORTS ME.

I
UNDERSTAND

AND PRETTY SOON
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR

OWN ADVENTURES.

RIGHT NOW,
MAYBE FOR YOU,

THAT'S
CHICAGO.

AW, ROY. 1
DON'T KNOW.

HEY, WHAT IF I
GO WITH YOU?

YOU WILL
BE WITH ME.

I'LL BE THINKING
OF YOU THE WHOLE TIME.

ROY, I'LL FIND A WAY. OK?

I LOVE THIS COUNTRY JUST AS
MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE,

ALRIGHT, AND IF YOU LOOK UP
CLOSE IN MY EYE YOU'LL SEE

AN AMERICAN FLAG WAVING,

AND ON MY SPINE IS GROWING
RED, WHITE AND BLUE. ALRIGHT?

I'LL FIND A WAY, ROY! I'LL
FIND A WAY!

WHATEVER
YOU SAY.

SO, TELL ME ABOUT
THIS DISNEY PARK.

IT'S
JUST AN IDEA.

BUT NOW,

NOW, TOGETHER WE ARE GOING
ON A REAL ADVENTURE.

THE DISNEY
BOYS ARE GOING OUT TO WAR.

NARRATOR: THINGS DIDN'T MOVE

QUITE AS FAST AS WALT HAD
HOPED AND HE FOUND HIMSELF

LIVING IN CHICAGO WITH ELIAS
AND FLORA.

CHICAGO WAS
BITTER-SWEET FOR WALT.

HE GOT A JOB AS A CARTOONIST
FOR HIS SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

HE
EVEN HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

BUT NOTHING COULD MAKE HIM
FORGET THAT ROY WAS GONE.

HE
MISSED HIS BROTHER,

AND HE WAS GOING TO FIND
A WAY TO JOIN HIM.

SOMETIMES IN YOUR
HEART,

YOU JUST KNOW IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

HE'D
FOLLOW IN ROY'S FOOTSTEPS

AND BE AS BRAVE AS HE COULD.

HE'D MAKE HIS BROTHER PROUD.

SO, WALT FIGURED HE'D GO
AHEAD AND FIGHT FOR OUR

COUNTRY.

HE WAS GOING TO ENLIST TO
FIGHT IN WORLD WAR 1

JUST LIKE ROY DID.

NEXT!

MR. DISNEY!

THE UNITED STATES ARMY

THANKS YOU FOR YOUR GUMPTION
AND YOUR COURAGE IN

APPROACHING THE RECRUITMENT
OFFICE TODAY, BUT

OF COURSE, SIR, IT'S MY DUTY
AS AN AMERICAN.

MR. DISNEY!

YES, SIR?

AT EASE, MR.
DISNEY.

LISTEN, KID, YOU'RE

SIXTEEN YEARS OLD.

UNDER THE SELECTIVE SERVICE
LAW,

CAN'T TAKE YOU UNLESS YOU'RE
18. GOT IT?

EXCUSE ME,

SIR, BUT I THINK MY PRIDE AS
AN AMERICAN MAKES UP FOR

THOSE YEARS.

MY WILLINGNESS
TO GET OUT THERE AND FIGHT

WITH MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.

I MEAN, I HAVE BRAVERY BUSTING

OUT OF MY SOUL! DOESN'T THAT
COUNT FOR ANYTHING?

WE APPRECIATE YOUR
BRAVERY, BUT

THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN
BREAK THE RULES FOR YOU.

SIR, DO YOU HAVE A
BROTHER?

YES. THREE
OF THEM,

WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING,

MR.
DISNEY?

WELL, IT HAS A WHOLE LOT TO DO
WITH ME, SIR.

I MEAN, MY BROTHER IS

OUT THERE,MY BROTHER IS OUT
IN THE FIGHT,

AND THERE'S

NOTHING I WANT MORE THAN TO
BE OUT THERE WITH HIM.

HIS
NAME IS ROY DISNEY.

AND HE'S
FULL OF COURAGE AND A LOVE

FOR AMERICA. AND,

I HAVE AS MUCH PRIDE FOR
HIM AS THIS COUNTRY.

I MEAN, T JUST WANT
TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW

HIM. SURELY YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT?

I DO UNDERSTAND.

AND IN TWO
YEARS I'M GOING TO BE REAL

PROUD TO CALL YOU A SOLDIER.

BUT UNTIL THEN, MY BACK'S
AGAINST THE WALL, KID.

RULES
ARE RULES.

I'M SURE YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT?

YES,
SIR.

NEXT!

MR. JOHNSTON,

YOU
GONNA SHAVE?

NARRATOR: NOW,

WALT DISNEY NEVER TOOK NO
FOR AN ANSWER. THERE WAS

THIS NEW AGENCY CALLED THE
RED CROSS THAT HELPED

PEOPLE.

AND THEY WERE FIXING
TO SEND SOME MEN ABROAD TO

HELP OUT WITH THE WAR.

AND
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, WELL,

YOU ONLY HAD TO BE 17 YEARS
OLD.

SURE, WALT WAS ONLY 16,

BUT HE FIGURED HE COULD
SQUEAK BY WITH A LITTLE BIT

OF HIS ARTISTIC TALENT.

BUT
WHEN FLORA AND ELIAS CAUGHT

WIND OF IT,

WELL, THEY WERE
NONE TOO HAPPY.

HOW
COULD YOU DO THIS, WALT?

YOU
WERE JUST GOING TO SNEAK OFF

AND NOT TELL US ANYTHING?

YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT

ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOTHER AND I
TO TELL US YOUR PLANS?

I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D LET ME
GO.

IT'S FOR OUR COUNTRY.

IT'S LIKE WHAT ROY'S DOING.

AND YOU WANTED TO

MARCH OFF WITHOUT EVEN
SAYING GOODBYE, WALT?

MARCH OFF TO DEATH!

DID YOU
KNOW THAT, WALT?

YOU COULD
DIE OUT THERE?

I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU WERE JUST GOING

TO MARCH OFF AND DIE AND NOT
TELL YOU MOTHER AND I

ANYTHING; NOT EVEN A LETTER.

I'M SORRY.

ALLTM
THINKING ABOUT IS ROY

AND
BEING BRAVE LIKE HIM.

WELL, YOU'RE NOT ROY.

ROY CAN TAKE CARE OF
HIMSELF OUT THERE.

ROY HAS RESPECTED MY
PLANS FOR THIS FAMILY ALL

ALONG.

HE HAS PROVEN HIMSELF
TO ME, WALT.

YOU WILL NEVER
BE ROY.

YOU ARE A DIFFERENT
SON.

YOU'RE THE DREAMER!

AND, WALT, DREAMERS, THEY
DON'T FIGHT.

I WON'T HAVE
Im

I DON'T WANT TO
FIGHT. I WANT TO HELP. AND

IF YOU'D JUST SIGN THIS
PAPER, I CAN BE A MEMBER OF

THE RED CROSS. I CAN BE A
PART OF THE RELIEF EFFORT.

LOOK, TJUST, I WANT TO AID
OUR COUNTRY AND PROTECT OUR

LIBERTIES AS AMERICANS!
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

NO, I DON'T!

I
DO.

EXCUSE ME?

IF WE DON'T SIGN, HE'LL JUST
FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO GO

AND SNEAK OFF,

AT LEAST THIS
WAY, WE CAN SAY GOODBYE TO

HIM AND HAVE A PROPER SEND
OFF.

HIS MIND IS SET.

I WILL NOT SIGN!

ELIAS, PLEASE. BE RATIONAL.

FLORA, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

I WILL NOT SIGN MY SON'S
DEATH WARRANT!

SORRY, MOM. I
SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

YES, YES YOU SHOULD HAVE.

BUT EVEN IF YOU DID, YOUR
FATHER WOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED

IT.

STILL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
RESPECTFUL THING TO DO.

IT'S JUST, I MISS
ROY. AND I WANTED TO DO

SOMETHING TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

I MEAN, AMERICA IS IMPORTANT
TO THIS FAMILY,

AND IF THIS
IS THE WAR TO END ALL WARS,

THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME
DREAMERS.

IT'S OKAY,
WALT. I UNDERSTAND.

NOW,
WHERE DO I SIGN?

WELCOME TO THE
AMERICAN RED CROSS TRAINING

FACILITY.

YOU GENTLEMAN ARE
WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL THE

AMBULANCE CORE.

PREPARING FOR WAR IS AN
UNDERSTATEMENT.

THERE ARE SO
MANY DISTURBING AND

GROTESQUE THINGS THAT YOU
WILL SEE ON THE FIELD,

THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT
TO RUN AWAY LIKE GIRLS

BUT YOU
CAN'T.

YOU HAVE TAKEN A VOW
TO BE A PART OF THIS CORP.

YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND YOUR
GROUND IN THE FIELD

AND BE
MEN.

AS THEY SAY,

WAR IS
HELL.

SO WELCOME TO HELL.

YOUR TRUCKS,

YOUR VEHICLES

WILL BE HOSTS TO THOUSANDS
OF LIVES,

AND MANY OF WHICH
WILL BE LOST DEPENDING ON

YOUR DRIVING ABILITIES.

LET'S JUST HOPE AND PRAY

THAT YOUR HOST

DOESN'T
BECOME

A GHOST HOST.

WELCOME

TO THE AMERICAN RED
CROSS.

PREPARE FOR BLOOD AND THE
FRENCH.

NARRATOR: NOW WALT
HAD WON THE BATTLE,

BUT HE
HADN'T WON THE WAR.

THE UNITED STATES DID THAT
WITHOUT HIM,

BUT WALT GOT
SHIPPED OFF TO FRANCE TO BE

PART OF THE AMBULANCE CORP,
ANYWAY.

THERE WERE STILL

RELIEF EFFORTS THAT NEEDED
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF,

AND IT WAS NOW HIS DUTY TO
GO AHEAD AND

TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

NOW WALT GOT TO SEE ALL SORTS
OF THINGS IN FRANCE.

IT WAS A WHOLE NEW SORT OF
EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.

HERE HE'D NEVER
LEFT THE MIDWEST

AND NOW HE WAS TRAVELLING
AROUND AN AWFUL LOT.

THIS SMALL TOWN BOY WAS
QUICKLY TURNING INTO A MAN.

TIMES SEEM TO MOVE
SLOWER IN FRANCE.

AND IT WAS
AT THIS POINT

WHERE WALT WAS
INTRODUCED TO CIGARETTES.

HOWEVER, JUST LIKE WHEN HE
WAS A BOY UNDER THE DREAMING

TREE,

HE FOUND COMFORT IN
ART.

AND JUST LIKE BEFORE,

IT WAS ON AN UNLIKELY
CANVAS.

[MOTOR RUNNING]

HEY, SEEN ANY
ACTION TODAY?

NOPE,
NOT TODAY.

NOT YESTERDAY, NOT EVEN THE
DAY BEFORE THAT.

I GUESS OUR INSTRUCTOR
WAS RIGHT.

IF BOREDOM IS
WHAT THEY MEAN BY HELL,

WAR
IS HELL!

HEY, FELLA, THOSE ARE SOME
PRETTY UNIQUE FUNNIES YOU

GOT OUT THERE.

THANKS,

BUT WHEN THEY'RE IN THE
PAPER THEY CALLED FUNNIES,

WHEN THEY'RE THAT BIG IT'S
CALLED ART.

WOW. ART.

DO YOU
MIND IF I SHOW MY BUDDY?

NEVER MINDED A BIT OF
PUBLICITY IN MY LIFE!

SURE.

HEY,
RAY! COME HERE!

CHECK THIS
OUT.

THEY CALL THIS ART!

RAY: THAT'S NOTHIN".

I KNOW
A GUY BACK ON THE EAST COAST

WHO CAN DRAW JUST AS GOOD AS
THAT.

HE'S DATING MY SISTER.

WELL, HE
AIN'T HERE, IS HE?

WELL, NO, BUT

BUT, NOTHIN".

WHAT'D YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS
AGAIN?

I DIDN'T.

BUT,
IT'S DISNEY.

WALT DISNEY.

WELL, MY
NAME'S JIM.

THIS IS MY
BUDDY, RAY.

AND DO YOU THINK

YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAW A
COUPLE OF THEM THINGS FOR

OUR MEAT WAGONS?

WHY,
SURE I COULD!

I COULD DRAW
SOMETHING FOR YOU,

YOUR
GALS, WHATEVER YOU NEED,

FOR
A NOMINAL FEE, OF COURSE.

HOW ABOUT A PACK OF
SMOKES?

MAKE IT A
CARTON AND I'LL DRAW BOTH OF

YOUR MODEL T'S!

SOLD!

JIM LET'S BRING *
EM AROUND!

NARRATOR: DOC SHERWOOD WAS
RIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO.

WALT NEEDED TO SEE THE WORLD
AND JUST LIKE HE PREDICTED

FRANCE WAS WHERE MUCH OF HIS
ART WAS PERFECTED. BUT BY

THE TIME WALT RETURNED HOME
TO KANSAS CITY HE WAS A

CHAIN SMOKER. SO, NATURALLY,
HE NEEDED A JOB TO PAY FOR

HIS NEW-FOUND HABIT. HE HAD
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR

OR AN ARTIST, BUT AS HE PUT
IT, "IT SEEMED EASIER TO GET

A JOB AS AN ARTIST".

WALT
WAS CRUSHED!

AND WHO BETTER
TO TURN TO FOR ADVICE?

WHY
BIG BROTHER ROY, OF COURSE!

ROY HAD BEEN WORKING AT A
BANK, AND WALT RUSHED RIGHT

ON DOWN TO TELL HIS SAD
TALE.

A COWORKER OF ROY'S

KNEW ABOUT SOME FELLAS WHO
RAN A COMMERCIAL ART SHOP

CALLED PESMEN-RUBIN

AND THEY WERE LOOKING TO
HIRE AN APPRENTICE

ROY GOT WALT AN
INTERVIEW AND, BOY,

WALT
COULDA KISSED HIM!

ROY!

I LOVE YOU, OL' BROTHER
OF MINE!

OK, YOU'RE
WELCOME. ALRIGHT? SHOW UP

FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH YOUR
BEST PORTFOLIOS, SOMETHING

THAT'LL KNOCK THEIR SOCKS
OFF.

YOU'LL DO THE TRICK.
OK?

I KNOW YOU WILL.

ROY O. DISNEY, YOU ARE THE

BEST BROTHER IN THE WHOLE
WORLD!

YOU ARE THE BEST BANK
TELLER IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

IT WAS A PLEASURE AND YOU

HAVE A GREAT STAFF IN THIS
BANK, JUST, UUMM!

HE'S
AN ARTIST.

NARRATOR: BUT NOT
ONLY DID WALT LAND THE GIG

AT PESMIN-RUBIN,

BUT AT A
WHOPPING

$50 DOLLARS A
MONTH!

HE ALWAYS WENT AFTER
HIS OWN DREAMS.

THE DREAMS
HE'D HAD

EVER SINCE HIS
AUNTIE MARGARET HAD GIVEN

HIM HIS FIRST ART SUPPLIES

AND SHE WAS JUST THE WOMAN

WALT WANTED TO TELL ABOUT
IT.

SAY! IS
THAT YOUR GAL?

SHE SURE IS A
LOOKER!

NO, SHE'S NOT
MY GAL

. IT'S MY AUNTIE. AND,
YES, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. AND

YOU SHOULD LEARN TO BE MORE
POLITE.

SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHIN'
BY IT, I WAS JUST,

SHE SURE
IS PRETTY

AND I BET SHE'S
JUST AS SWELL, TOO.

SHE SURE IS.

I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM
TODAY WITHOUT HER.

AND WHERE I AM TODAY IS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE A REAL LUCKY GUY TO

HAVE A NICE LADY LIKE THAT
AS YOUR AUNTIE.

I SURE
AM.

AND I'M ON MY WAY TO
TELL HER THAT, TOO.

WOW! SHE SURE IS
A BEAUT!

SHE'S NOT A
RACEHORSE FELLA! ALRIGHT?

WOULD YOU TALK TO YOUR

MOTHER WITH A MOUTH LIKE
THAT?

NO.
NO. SEE,

MY MOM HAS A
TENDENCY TO HIT ME OVER THE

HEAD WHEN I'M BEING
IMPOLITE.

WELL, SHE'LL

EITHER KNOCKS SENSE INTO YOU
OR OUT OF YOU.

I DON'T KNOW
WHICH.

NOW YOU NEED TO LEARN
TO BEHAVE.

I'LL TRY! BUT,

SOMETIMES, I MISBEHAVE WHEN
I'M NOT EVEN TRYING.

LISTEN, FELLA,

YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THE
WORLD LIKE THAT.

YOU NEED TO
STRAIGHTEN UP!

STRAIGHTEN
UP!

GET A JOB.

YOU HAVE A
JOB?

WELL, GET A JOB.

YOU GIVE MY BEST
TO THAT PRETTY AS A PRINCESS

AUNTIE OF YOURS!

WHAT A
BEAUT!

NARRATOR: WALT HEADED

OVER TO THE HOTEL AS FAST AS
HE COULD. HE WAS AWFULLY

OVER TO THE HOTEL AS FAST AS
HE COULD. HE WAS AWFULLY

EXCITED TO TELL HIS AUNTIE
THE GOOD NEWS.

HE FELT LIKE A STEAM ENGINE
COMING DOWN THE TRACK.

THEN HE WAS

BARRELING UP THOSE STAIRS AS
FAST AS HE COULD!

SUDDENLY
HE WAS GRINNING

AND KNOCKING
LOUDLY AT THE DOOR.

HE
WANTED TO TELL HIS AUNTIE.

HE WANTED TO TELL THE WHOLE
WORLD.

UNCLE ROBERT!

UNCLE ROBERT: HEY, WALTER!

AUNTIE! YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE IT.

THEY'RE
PAYING ME TO DRAW PICTURES!

I GOT A JOB AT PESMIN-RUBIN.

THEY'RE PAYING ME FIFTY
DOLLARS A MONTH!

I'M A REAL
ARTIST NOW!

AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU.

WHO IS IT, ROBERT?

AUNTIE MARGARET, IT'S ME,
WALT!

ROBERT: IT'S OUR
NEPHEW, MARGARET.

ELIAS'S
SON, WALTER.

WHO
ISIT?

WHO?

I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

AUNTIE MARGARET, IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE NEPHEW!

IT'S WALT.

YOU GAVE
ME MY TABLET,

MY DRAWING
SUPPLIES.

IF IT WASN'T FOR
YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT,

I WOULDN'T BE AN ARTIST!

YOU USED TO RAVE ABOUT MY
PICTURES!

I'M
TIRED.

I THINK I'M GOING TO
SLEEP FOR A WHILE.

ROBERT:
I'M SORRY, WALTER.

MARGARET
ISN'T FEELING WELL.

PERHAPS YOU SHOULD COME
BACK ANOTHER DAY.

I DON'T, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

AUNTIE MARGARET,

IT'S ME, WALTER,

YOUR
KINDRED SPIRIT, THE ARTIST.

WALTER, PLEASE, COME
HERE.

MARGARET IS REALLY
SICK NOW.

THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S
FIGHTING OFF PNEUMONIA.

NOW SHE'S BEEN
GETTING â€˜FORGETFUL LATELY.

PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

SURELY SHE
WOULD REMEMBER ME.

IF I COULD JUST TALK TO HER
FOR A ONE MINUTE.

WALT,
I'M REALLY SORRY,

TRULY I
AM,

BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

MARGARET NEEDS HER REST.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

1JuUsT
WANT TO THANK HER

FOR
ENCOURAGING ME TO DRAW

WALT, PLEASE,
PLEASE!

PLEASE DON'T MAKE

THIS ANY MORE DIFFICULT THAN
IT ALREADY IS.

OH.
GOSH, I'M SORRY.

I DIDN'T
MEAN TO BE A TROUBLE,

1JuUsT
IS IT OK IF I SAY GOODBYE?

I
MEAN, PLEASE GIVE ME THAT.

I'LL BE QUICK.

I JUST WANT
TO SAY GOODBYE.

SURE, SURE, WALT. GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU

I HOPE
SHE GETS BETTER.

IT WAS GOOD
SEEING YOU.

IT WAS
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO,

WALTER. GIVE MY BEST TO
ELIAS.

[DOOOR SHUTS]

WHO
WAS THAT, ROBERT?

NO
ONE, DEAR.

NO ONE.

[SAD MUSIC]

NARRATOR:
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WERE

TOUGH ON WALT.

HIS AUNTIE
PASSED AWAY FROM PNEUMONIA.

HE NEVER REALLY GOT TO
CONVEY TO HER JUST HOW

GRATEFUL HE WAS.

HE NEVER
GOT TO FEEL HER OLD

ENTHUSIASM ABOUT HIS TALENT.

THE ENTHUSIASM THAT GAVE HIM

THE CONFIDENCE TO PURSUE HIS
DREAMS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

AND HE LOST HIS JOB AT
PESSMIN- RUBIN DUE TO

DOWNSIZING.

THINGS WERE
LOOKING PRETTY BLEAK FOR

WALT.

BUT HE DIDN'T LOSE
FAITH.

HE KNEW HE HAD A GOD
GIVEN TALENT

AND IT WAS
MEANT FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL.

ELIAS WAS RIGHT, HE WAS THE
DREAMER.

AND DREAMERS NEVER
QUIT.

[KNOCK ON THE DOOR]

UBBE: HEY, WALT! IT'S
ME, THE DONUT EATING

CHAMPION OF PESSMIN-RUBIN,
UBBE!

UBBE IWERKS!

CO-CAPTAIN!

UBBE, OLD
BUDDY, OLD PAL!

COME TO
OFFER ME MY JOB BACK?

I'VE GOT A LOT OF PROSPECTS
ON THE HORIZON.

NO! I GOT
KICKED OUT ON MY REAR, TOO.

THAT'S WHY I CAME BY.

I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU HAD
SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

I'VE GOT TO SUPPORT MY MOTHER

AND SHE'S NOT THE MOST GENTLE
MOTHER,

IF YA KNOW WHAT I
MEAN.

SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU HAD SOMETHING.

I'M
DESPERATE, WALT.

DESPERATE,
I TELL YA!

I DIDN'T KNOW IF

MAYBE WITH YOUR CONNECTIONS
WITH YOUR BROTHER ROY IF YOU

HAD SOMETHING. ANYTHING!

TO BE HONEST, UBBE, I

DON'T HAVE MUCH GOING ON
MYSELF.

COME ON, WALT.

IF ANYBODY COULD THINK OF
SOMETHING IT'S YOU.

YOU'RE A
THINKER.

I'VE GOT YOUR
NUMBER! YOU'VE GOT ONE OF

THE GREATEST MINDS IN ALL
THE WORLD.

IF YOU JUST PUT
YOUR MIND TO IT,

YOU'LL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

ALRIGHT, CALM DOWN, CALM
DOWN,

YOU'RE GONNA WAKE THE
NEIGHBORS.

IT'S
DAYLIGHT, WALT.

SOME
OF EM TAKE NAPS.

BUT I CAN'T THINK WITH YOU
BEING A BIG BUNDLE OF NERVES.

NOW GIVE ME A SECOND TO
THINK ABOUT IT.

RIGHT,
RIGHT,

SORRY IF I JUST LET

YOU THINK THEN WE CAN COME
UP WITH SOMETHING.

THINK,
THINK, THINK!

TUT-TUT!
A MINUTE, ALRIGHT?

A MINUTE!

RIGHT!

[HEAVY BREATHING]

CAN YOU
BREATHE A LITTLE QUIETER?

IT'S NOT REALLY MY
FAULT.

THE DOCTOR SAYS WHEN
I GET ALL STRESSED,

MYSINUSES AND NASAL
CAVATIES FLARE UP AND, 1, I

,DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

IF I COULD JUST THINK, THINK,
THINK!

BUT PESMEN-RUBIN
AND

BY JOVE, I THINK I'VE
GOT IT!

GOT WHAT?

AN IDEA, UBBE. AN
IDEA.

OH! WHAT IS
Ime

WE GO INTO
BUSINESS FOR OURSELVES!

HUM, UM, I DON'T THINK
SO.

WE DON'T NEED AN
AGENCY.

WE CUT OUT THE
MIDDLE MAN.

IT'S JUST US.

ALL WE NEED IS CLIENTS.

WE
CAN CALL IT

IWERKS-DISNEY
COMMERCIAL ARTISTS!

YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME TOP
BILLING?

WELL,
"DISNEY-IWERKS" SOUNDS LIKE

YOU'RE GOING TO GO GET YOUR
EYES CHECKED OUT

OR GET A
NICE PAIR OF SPECTACLES.

WE'RE COMMERCIAL ARTISTS.

WE'RE NOT OPTOMETRISTS.

I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT,

YOU GO SET UP
SHOP,

I'LL GET THE CLIENTS,

AND WE'LL BE IN BUSINESS IN
NO TIME!

WELL, WHAT ARE YA
DOING?

GET GOING!

RIGHT! YES, SIR! MR. DISNEY,

WALT
DISNEY, SIR!

NARRATOR: NOW
WALT AND UBBE WEREN'T DOING

TOO BAD AT ALL!

WALT DID THE
SALES PITCHES AND GOT ENOUGH

CLIENTS TO AFFORD THEM THEIR
OWN OFFICE

AND PLENTY OF
PROFIT.

THE IWWERKS-DISNEY
COMMERCIAL ARTISTS COMPANY

WAS IN BUSINESS, ALRIGHT!

WELL, FOR A LITTLE WHILE
ANYWAY.

YA SEE, WALT GOT A
JOB AS AN ANIMATION

CARTOONIST AT THE KANSAS
CITY SLIDE COMPANY,

AND HE LEFT UBBE IN CHARGE OF
THEIR COMPANY.

UBBE WASN'T MUCH OF
A TAKE CHARGE KINDA GUY.

THINGS WENT DOWNHILL FAST,

AND SOON ENOUGH UBBE WAS
ASKING WALT IF HE COULD GET

A JOB AT KANSAS CITY SLIDE
COMPANY, TOO.

SO, THAT WAS

THE END OF IWERKS- DISNEY
COMMERCIAL ARTISTS COMPANY.

AND THE BEGINNING OF
LEARNING A NEW KIND OF

DRAWING;

ANIMATION.

HOW IT BEGAN MIGHT SEEM
A BIT PRIMITIVE,

BUT REMEMBER, YOU
HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE.

SO, FIRST, AN ANIMATOR DRAWS A
PICTURE.

THEN THEY CUT OUT

WHATEVER PARTS ARE GOING TO
MOVE.

AND THEY TACK THOSE

MOVEABLE PIECES ONTO A BOARD
WITH A LITTLE PIN;

SNAP A
PICTURE,

MOVE THE PIECE A
TINY BIT,

PIN IT AGAIN,

SNAP
A PICTURE,

MOVE THE PIECE
AGAIN,

WELL, YOU GET THE
PICTURE.

THIS WAS HOW THEY
RAN THE ANIMATION DEPARTMENT

WHERE WALT WORKED AT THE
KANSAS CITY SLIDE COMPANY.

BUT HE'D HEARD OF A NEW KIND
OF ANIMATION.

CEL ANIMATION.

IT WAS A WHOLE LOT MORE
CREATIVE,

A WHOLE LOT MORE
INVENTIVE,

A WHOLE LOT MORE
WALT DISNEY.

ROY: WOW! I

LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH
THE PLACE!

ROY, I'M
GONNA MAKE MAGIC IN HERE.

I BORROWED THIS CAMERA FROM
MR. CAUGER,

AND I'M GOING TO
MAKING CEL ANIMATION!

IT'S THE HOTEST THING OUT
OF NEW YORK.

IT'S GOING TO
REVOLUTIONIZE

THE WAY
ANIMATED FILMS ARE MADE.

WELL, IT'S NOT WHAT
ELIAS HAD IN MIND WHEN HE

BUILT THIS GARAGE,

BUT I'M
SURE HE'D BE IMPRESSED TO

SEE YOU MAKING MOVING
PICTURES IN HERE!

YEAH! I'M ON TO SOMETHING
BIG HERE, ROY.

I CAN FEEL
IT.

IT'S SO MODERN AND
EXCITING!

AND I'M GOOD AT

IT, ROY. I'M GOOD AT IT.

I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD AT
IT.

YOU'RE GOOD AT ANYTHING
YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO,

BUT CAN YOU MAKE SOMETHING
OUT OF THIS?

I MEAN, IF YOU CAN
MAKE SOME MONEY AT THIS,

SOME REAL MONEY, YOU SHOULD
OPEN A BUSINESS.

ROY,
OL' BROTHER OF MINE, YOU'RE

TALKING TO SOMEOBODY WHO'S
ALREADY PROCURED HIMSELF AN

INTERVIEW WITH THE "KING OF
KANSAS CITY SHOW BIZ"!

FRANK NEWMAN?!?!

YES,
FRANK L. NEWMAN, THE OWNER

OF THE NEWMAN THEATER ON
MAIN STREET;

SEATING ONE
THOUSAND SEATS

AND IN
ITALIAN RENAISSANCE STYLE!

ILLUSTRATED THEIR PROGRAMS
WHEN I WORKED AT

PESMEN-RUBIN,

SO I ALREADY
HAD AN IN.

I TOLD THEM ABOUT

THESE LAUGH-O-GRAMS ME AND
THE FELLAS WERE WORKING ON

AND THEY LIKED THE IDEA;

SAID MR. NEWMAN WOULD LOVE
TO SEE EM!

AND WHAT'S
A LAUGH-O-GRAM, EXACTLY?

WELL, YA KNOW HOW
BEFORE A MOVIE BEGINS THEY

SHOW A FEW MINUTES OF A NEWS
REEL?

YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

WELL, IT'S JUST LIKE
THAT BUT WITH MOVING

CARTOONS!

OK, JUST IMAGINE,
LIKE, A COMMENTARY ON

SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING
IN THE CITY. YOU KNOW HOW

EVERYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT
THE TRANSPORTATION BEING SO

SLOW.

WELL, WE SHOW A LADY
SITTING THERE, WAITING FOR

HER TROLLEY,

AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW, A FLOWER IS

GROWING UP AROUND HER
HOSIERY.

YEAH? WELL,
SHOW ME!

ALRIGHT, YOU
ONLY HAVE TO PAINT THE

BACKGROUND ONCE, OK?

ANYTHING THAT MOVES ON THE

FOREFRONT OF A TRANSPARENT
CELLULOID.

BUT IF ONLY ONE

CHARACTER IS TALKING AND THE
OTHER IS STANDING STILL,

YOU ONLY HAVE TO MOVE ONE
CHARACTER

AND THEN YOU JUST

USE A STATIONARY CEL FOR THE
OTHER.

HERE, LEMME ME SHOW
YA.

[PAPER MOVING BACK AND FORTH]

THAT'S AH, THAT'S
REALLY SOMETHING!

I THINK I'M GONNA BE IN
BUSINESS AGAIN!

AND IF THESE
LAUGH-O-GRAMS TAKE OFF,

I CAN START MAKING LONGER
FILMS;

WHOLE ANIMATED FILMS,

ONE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS,

FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO SEE
TOGETHER!

WELL, YA KNOW
I'M ROOTING FOR YA.

SO DID YOU, DID YOU FINISH
THIS ONE?

YEAH, IT'S
PERFECT.

[SOUND OF RUNNUNG
PROJECTOR]

NEWMAN: THESE ARE
THE BEES KNEES, MR. DISNEY!

I MEAN IT!

WALT: SAY, WE

COULD DO ONE WHERE BEES HAVE
KNEES; THAT'D GET A LAUGH,

WOULDN'T IT!

NEWMAN: AIN'T
THAT THE TRUTH, SON---AIN'T

THAT THE TRUTH! WELL, I LOVE
EM!

LOVE EM?

YEAH, LOVE EM! GOTTA HAVE
EM!

GOTTA HAVE EM?

RIGHT HERE, RIGHT
NOW!

THAT'S WHAT YA COME
HERE FOR, AIN'T IT?

WHY, YES, SIR! YEAH, IT IS.

NOW, TELL ME, HOW
MUCH YOU WANT FOR THESE HERE

LAUGH-O- GRAMS?

ARE THEY GONNA BE
TOO EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE

OR CAN I BUY EM
FROM YA?

OH, GOSH,
WELL

ARE YOU TELLING
ME YOU CAME TO A BUSINESS

MEETING AND YOU DON'T HAVE A
SALES PITCH?

WHAT IS THIS,

YOUR FIRST TIME AROUND THE
BLOCK, KID?

NO, NO,
NO.

OF COURSE NOT!

IT'S JUST
I HAVE A FROG IN MY THROAT.

WELL, YOU TELL HIM
TO JUMP ON OUT HERE AND GIVE

ME A PRICE.

[AIN'T GOT ALL
DAY.

30 CENTS A FOOT.

DEAL,

COME ON, LET'S
SHAKE ON IT.

HA, HA, HA, MR.
DISNEY,

I BELIEVE THAT THIS
IS GONNA BE THE BEGINNING OF

A BEE-U-TIFUL RELATIONSHIP!

SURE IS, SIR! SURE IS.

AND THANKS FOR WATCHING THIS
AND GIVING ME THE TIME TO

SHOW YOU

KID, I
AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

SAVE YOUR MUSH FOR YOUR
GAL AND MOVE ON OUT.

YES, SIR!

SORRY, SIR!

THIS IS
NOT THE MILITARY.

MY NAME'S
MR. NEWMAN.

THE DOOR'S OVER
THERE.

RIGHT.

THANKS
MR. NEWMAN!

ENOUGH
ALREADY!

GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I CHANGE MY OFFER!

NARRATOR: NOW WALT LEFT THAT

MEETING WITH MR. NEWMAN
FEELING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS

UNTIL HE REALIZED HE WASN'T
GOING TO MAKE ANY MONEY ON

THE DEAL. HE WAS SO EXCITED
TO HAVE SOLD HIS

LAUGH-O-GRAMS TO THE KING OF
KANSAS CITY SHOW BIZ, THAT

HE FORGOT TO FIGURE IN HIS
PROFIT ON THE PRICING. OH,

WELL. WALT WASN'T
DISCOURAGED. HE HAD A NEW

WELL. WALT WASN'T
DISCOURAGED. HE HAD A NEW

OFFICE SPACE FOR HE AND THE
FELLAS,

AH, PARDON ME, HIS
EMPLOYEE,

TO WORK OUT OF.

PLUS THEY'D GONE OUT AND
GOTTEN A MODEL T

TO RIDE AROUND IN AND DRUM
UP BUSINESS.

THEY EVEN ALREADY
HAD A FEW CLIENTS AND

INVESTORS TRICKLING IN.

ENOUGH THAT WALT FELT
INSPIRED.

AND WHEN WALT FELT
INSPIRED,

WELL, HE WAS STILL

WORKING ON IT LONG AFTER
EVERYBODY ELSE WENT HOME.

WELL, HELLO THERE.

YA
KNOW THERE'S A CAT THAT

PROWLS THESE PARTS, RIGHT?

BUT DON'T WORRY,

IF YOU STAY
WITH ME,

I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.

JUST AS LONG AS I FEED YA,
HUH?

WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS

TALKING TO A BUSINESS
MOUSE.

I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE
COMPANY.

YOU KNOW, SINCE
WE'RE NEWLY ACQUAINTED

FRIENDS,

I SHOULD PROBABLY
TELL YOU,

I GONNA CHANGE THE
WORLD.

AND IT ALL STARTS
RIGHT HERE.

I KNOW A LOT OF
PEOPLE SAY THAT,

BUT YOU
KNOW,

I'M GOING TO DO IT.

I'M GONNA DO IT.

GO AHEAD
AND FINISH THAT.

I'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

NARRATOR:
ALICE'S WONDERLAND WAS ONE

OF THE FIRST FILMS TO HAVE
LIVE ACTION CHARACTERS

APPEAR INSIDE A CARTOON AND
INTERACT WITH ANIMATED

CHARACTERS.

ALRIGHT, VIRGINIA, COME OVER
AND SIT DOWN.

I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT
MY DRAWING PAD HERE.

YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO SEE ANYTHING,

BUT I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE;

YOU HAVE AN IMAGINATION,
RIGHT?

VIRGINIA: YES, SIR!

ARE YOU SURE?

YES!

IT'S NOT BROKEN OR ANYTHING
ISIT?

NO, SIR! T WAS IMAGINING
LAST NIGHT FOR TODAY

AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE SLEEPING

BUT MY MOTHER
GOT MAD.

OH! WELL, I HOPE WE MEET YOUR
EXPECTATIONS!

SO, VIRGINIA,
FOR THIS SCENE,

I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT MY DRAWING PAD

AND IMAGINE THAT THERE'S A
DOGHOUSE. OK?

OK.

HERE'S THIS SCUFFLE
GOING ON INSIDE, OK?

AND THE DOG KEEPS GETTING
THROWN OUT!

BY WHO?

WELL, AT THE END YOU'LL FIND
out

THAT THERE'S CAT LIVING
INSIDE!

OH! THAT'S
SILLY!

WELL, THEN YOU

DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE
ANYTHING AT ALL.

Just
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

AND
ABOUT HOW SILLY IT IS.

AND
JUST THINK ABOUT HOW

IT
MAKES YOU LAUGH

AND THEN
JUST LAUGH. OK?

OK

(PHONE RINGS)

HOLD ON,
VIRGINIA.

FRED! CAN YOU
ANSWER THAT PLEASE?

UBBE:
HE'S GOT IT WALT!

CAN YOU TELL HIM TO
HANG IT UP

AND LEAVE IT OFF THE HOOK SO
WE DON'T GET ANYMORE

INTERRUPTIONS?

UBBE: SURE
THING, WALT!

FRED: HEY, CAN

I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE,
WALT?

SORRY, VIRGINIA.

HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE MY PET
MOUSE?

YES

HEY, UBBE! SHOW HER THE
MOUSE!

UBBE: WHERE'D IT GO?

OH, I SEE HIM. THERE HE
GOES. THERE'S THE MOUSE.

ALRIGHT, WHAT IS IT
FRED?

THAT WAS THE
BANK, WALT.

THEY SAID WE
BOUNCED OUR LAST 20 CHECKS,

INCLUDING PAYROLL.

THEY'RE
ADDING INTEREST AND FEES.

I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO
CAN HELP US OUT?

I MEAN, ONE OF YOUR INVESTOR
FRIENDS, MAYBE?

NO, NO, NO, NO.

I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE
INVESTORS.

WE'RE ALL DRIED
UP, FRED.

I TELL YOU WHAT,

LET'S CONTINUE WORKING ON
ALICE'S WONDERLAND WITH

VIRGINIA.

WE'VE ALREADY
INVESTED SO MUCH IN THIS.

ALRIGHT?

AND I'LL DRUM UP
SOME MORE BUSINESS. ALRIGHT?

I PROMISE, I WILL.

SURE, WALT. IT'S JUST, WELL,

ME AND THE GUYS,

WE'VE GOT
TO EAT, AND ALL,

AND WITH
OUR CHECKS BOUNCING,

IT'S
JUST

YEAH, T FEEL
AWFUL ABOUT THAT, FRED,

FOR
YOU AND THE GUYS.

YOU KNOW
WHAT?

LET'S TAKE A BREAK AND
ORDER SOME LUNCH FROM THE

DINER DOWNSTAIRS. ALRIGHT?

WALT

NO BUT'S,

ALRIGHT? I INSIST.

BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO PAY THEM WITH?

CARTOONS?

THIS IS YOUR MONEY, WALT.

IF THERE'S ANY LEFT
OVER YOU SPLIT IT BETWEEN

THE GUYS. ALRIGHT?

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

NOW GO ON, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO VIRGINIA.

NARRATOR:
NOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT

WALT DISNEY BELIEVED IN,

IT
WAS HIS TALENT.

WHETHER THAT
TALENT WAS ART

OR BEING THE
BEST SALESMAN THE WORLD HAD

EVER KNOWN.

HE MUST HAVE HIT
UP EVERY CLIENT HE'D EVER

WORKED WITH IN HIS ENTIRE
CAREER.

PLUS ALL THE ONES HE
NEVER WORKED WITH.

HE WAS
GOING TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE

LAUGH-O-GRAM STUDIOS,

AND
HIS FRIENDS,

EVEN IF IT
DROVE HIM INTO THE GROUND.

SEE, ALL OF HIS EMPLOYEES,

THE FELLAS,

THEY BELIEVED IN
WALT AND HIS TALENT AND

VISION, TOO.

SO, HE JUST
COULDN'T GIVE UP.

NOT EVER.

AND, GOOD THING, TOO,

BECAUSE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE

HEARD ABOUT IT,

AND SENT MR.
MCCRUMB WALT'S WAY.

MCCRUM: SO, I GET THESE
FINANCIAL GRANTS,

ABOUT $500 EACH, TO
DO EDUCATIONAL FILMS,

AND, WELL, WE'D LIKE
LAUGH-O-GRAM TO DO ONE.

WALT: I'M
INTERESTED.

MCCRUM: GOOD,

WELL, IT'S CALLED "TOMMY
TUCKER'S TOOTH".

IT'S FOR
THE DEANER DENTAL INSTITUTE

OF KANSAS CITY.

OK,

WHAT'S THE PREMISE?

WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO TEACH KIDS?

LIKE, HOW TO BRUSH THEIR
TEETH?

MCCRUM: IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING, YES.

WELL, LET'S ASSUME YOU HAVE AN
OPEN POSITION

AND YOU'VE TWO
EQUALLY QUALIFIED,

PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.

NOW
ONE HAS BAD TEETH,

ONE HAS
GOOD TEETH.

WHICH DO YOU
CHOOSE?

I GUESS IT

DEPENDS ON THEIR
PERSONALITIES, I SUPPOSE.

SURE, BUT WELL,
LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY'RE

IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY,

EXCEPT FOR THEIR TEETH.

NOW ONE HAS PRISTINE, PEARLY
WHITES,

AND THE OTHER HAS
DECAYING, ROTTING ONES.

I SEE YOUR POINT.

SEE, TOMMY TUCKER
TAKES CARE OF HIS TEETH

AND
JIMMY JONES DOESN'T.

WE HOPE
TO TEACH THE CHILDREN THE

IMPORTANCE OF DENTAL
HYGIENE.

OKAY, I'M IN!

GOOD. GOOD, WELL,

WE'LL CONTINUE OUR
DISCUSSION AT THE INSTITUTE.

CAN WE, CAN WE TALK
HERE?

MR. DISNEY, I'VE ASSEMBLED A
TEAM AT THE INSTITUTE.

I THINK YOU'LL
FIND IT HELPFUL TO GATHER

THE INFORMATION YOU NEED
THERE

AND TO SIGN THE
PAPERWORK.

BOY, THIS
IS, AH,

THIS IS
EMBARRASSING.

IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. DISNEY?

YOU CAN CALL ME WALT.

IT'S JUST THESE ARE HARD
TIMES, MR. MCCRUM, AND

THAT THEY ARE, WALT.

THAT THEY ARE.

IT'S JUST I HAVE ONE PAIR OF
SHOES, YOU SEE?

AND THEY'RE
AT THE COBBLER RIGHT NOW,

AND I HAVEN'T THE BUCK-FIFTY TO
GET EM BACK.

NOT A
PROBLEM AT ALL, WALT.

AS A
MATTER OF FACT,

I LIVE JUST DOWN THE STREET
FROM THE COBBLER.

HOW ABOUT THIS,

I'LL DROP YOU OFF,

RETRIEVE
YOUR SHOES,

AND THEN I'LL
PICK YOU UP FOR THE MEETING.

GOSH, MR. MCCRUMB.

I'LL PAY YOU BACK, I
PROMISE.

I MEAN, YOU CAN

TAKE IT OUTTA MY SALARY FOR
THE PROJECT.

NOT A
PROBLEM AT ALL, WALT.

LET'S CONSIDER IT ONE GOOD
CHRISTIAN HELPING ANOTHER.

THAT'S AWFUL NICE OF
YOU, MR. MCCRUMB.

IT'S AWFUL
NICE.

WELL, SHALL
WE?

NARRATOR: WALT WAS
THRILLED TO HAVE A JOB OF

ANY KIND,

AND THIS ONE WENT
REALLY WELL

.HE LIKED
WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN

INVOLVED IN "TOMMY TUCKER'S
TOOTH".

SURE THE PAY WASN'T
GREAT,

BUT IT SEEMED LIKE A
GREAT PAYOFF, ANYWAY

ON ACCOUNT OF IT WAS
EDUCATIONAL

AND IT WOULD
HELP CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE

OF THEIR TEETH.

WALT FELT LIKE HE HAD DONE
SOMETHING GOOD,

BUT NOBODY HAD BEEN
PAID IN A LONG WHILE NOW.

SO WALT DOLED OUT THE CASH
TO EVERYONE BUT HIMSELF AGAIN.

FIGURING WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND.

HOPING THAT SOMETHING GOOD
WOULD COME BACK TO HIM,

HE HAD FAITH
THAT GOD WOULD PROVIDE.

BUT,
HE KINDA WANTED TO EAT, TOO.

TIMES WERE TOUGH AT
LAUGH-O-GRAM.

CLIENTS WERE
SCARCE,

BILLS WERE MOUNTING,
BUT WALT TRIED PRESSING ON.

HE'D BEEN BORROWING MONEY
HERE AND THERE,

TRYING OTHER
WAYS TO MAKE A BUCK;

EVEN ADVERTISING TO TAKE
BABY PICTURES

AND EVEN PET
PICTURES!

THE GUYS ALWAYS KEPT EACH
OTHER IN GOOD SPIRITS,

KEPT EACH OTHER
LAUGHING AND SMILING,

BUT LAUGHS AND SMILES
DON'T PAY THE BILLS.

SOON THE
COLLECTORS,

WELL, THEY CAME
KNOCKIN',

AND A KNOCKIN',
AND A KNOCKIN'.

YES, I WAS HERE YESTERDAY,
AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT, AND

THE DAY BEFORE THAT,
ETCETERA, ETCETERA,

ETCETERA!

UBBE: OH, YEAH, I
REMEMBER YOU. DIDN'T YOU EAT

THE LAST JELLY DONUT?

NO, I MOST
CERTAINLY DID NOT!

I'M
LOOKING FOR A MR. DINSEY.

CHORUS: MR. DINSEY?

NOPE, NO MR. DINSEY HERE.

NEXT DOOR, MAYBE.

DID
YOU TRY KANSAS CITY?

KANSAS?

I KNOW VERY WELL
THAT MR. DINSEY SIGNED

PAPERS TO INCORPORATE THIS
LAUGH-O-GRAM STUDIOS.

HE
HASN'T PAID HIS CREDITORS,

AND HE NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF
THAT RIGHT AWAY!

RIGHT AWAY,
I TELL YOU!

TELL ME,

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS
POOR OLD MR. DINSEY IF HE

DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF SUCH
MATTERS?

WELL, IT WOULD BE VERY BAD!

VERY BAD, INDEED!

IF IT MEANS A
VISIT BY YOU EVERY DAY,

I'D
HAVE TO AGREE.


THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER,
SIR!

BUT YOU ADMIT HE

SIGNED PAPERWORK FOR
LAUGH-O-GRAM STUDIOS?

OH, NOW YOU'RE
JUST TRYING TO RUFFLE MY

FEATHERS AREN'T YOU?

LISTEN, MR?

THAT'S NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, SIR!

RIGHT,

WELL, I BET MR. DINSEY,

JUST LIKE THE REST OF US
POST WAR WORKERS,

IS PROBABLY A
LITTLE BIT DOWN ON HIS LUCK

RIGHT NOW.

SO CHIN UP!

AND I'M SURE HE'LL PAY
HIS BILLS IN NO TIME!

NO TIME AT ALL!

AND MIGHT I GET
YOUR NAME, SIR?

WELL,
IT SURE IS NOT MR. DINSEY,

AND I SURELY HOPE THAT
WE DON'T EVER MEET AGAIN.

OH, YOU'LL SEE ME TOMORROW!

WHAT A PREFECT WAY TO
SPEND MY DAY.

SAY,
WALT,

DO WE HAVE ANY OF
THOSE JELLY DONUTS LEFT?

WHAT? DID UBBE EAT THEM
AGAIN?

$0, YOU,
ARE, IN FACT, MR. DINSEY?

NO, I'M MR. DISNEY!

IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT,
SAY IT RIGHT!

NARRATOR: THE LAUGH-O-GRAM
STUDIO BUSINESS

WAS GOING DOWNHILL FAST.

WALT DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO SAVE IT.

THINGS LOOKED
DISMAL.

WALT JUST COULDN'T
SEEM TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

BUT IT SURE WASN'T FOR LACK
OF TRYING.

IT'S JUST THAT
TOONS, BEFORE MOVIES,

ONLY MADE UP ABOUT 2% OF
THE THEATRE BUSINESS.

THAT FINISHED MR. NEWMAN'S
DEALIN'S WITH WALT

BUT THE
ROUGHEST THING TO FACE

WASN'T THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOSING LAUGH-O-GRAM STUDIOS,

IT WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOSING HIS BROTHER.


WALT, IS
THAT YOU?

YEAH, I WAS
HOPING I DIDN'T WAKE YA.

I JUST GOT BACK
FROM WORK.

JUST GETTING BACK?

YOU NEED TO TAKE BETTER
CARE OF YOURSELF.

LISTEN TO
YOU.

LOOKING OUT FOR ME,

EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING
TERRIBLE.

I'LL ADMIT,
I'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS.

COME ON IN, I NEED TO TALK TO
YOU FOR A MINUTE.

YA KNOW I'M
LEAVING TOMORROW,

DON'T 'CHA?

DOC SAYS A WARMER CLIMATE
WILL BE BETTER FOR ME.

AFTER GETTING TUBERCULOSIS
DURING THE WAR,

THESE MISSOURI
WINTERS

HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN
TOO KIND TO ME.

YEAH.

I THOUGHT I'D SEE MORE
OF YA BEFORE I LEFT.

I'VE JUST BEEN WORKING, YOU
KNOW?

IT'S OKAY, WALT.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

AFRAID OF WHAT?

AFRAID I'M GOING TO DIE.

DON'T SAY THAT, ROY.

IT'S JUST MY TIME,

AND
BY THE GRACE OF GOD,

I'LL
GO. I'M NOT SCARED.

WELL, I'M SCARED! YOU KNOW?

I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'D DO WITHOUT YA,

AND I
CAN'T LOSE YA, ROY,

1JuUsT
CAN'T.

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
AROUND WHO,

YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE AROUND HERE WHO

UNDERSTAND ME.

AND MAYBE I'M
SELFISH, BUT I'M NOT READY.

I'M NOT.

I'M NOT GOING TO
SAY GOODBYE.

I AM ALWAYS GOING TO
BE WITH YOU,

EVEN THROUGH LIFE AND DEATH.

YOU CAN TALK TO ME ANY TIME
YOU WANT;

WHEN YOU'RE
SCARED,

OR NEED ADVICE,

OR
SUPPORT.

I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE
YOu;

MAYBE HERE IF THAT'S
WHAT THE GOOD LORD HAS

PLANNED,
BUT

IT'S JUST NEVER
GOODBYE,

NOT REALLY.


LOOK AT ME, LOOKING TO YOU
FOR SOME KIND OF SOLACE WHEN

YOU'RE THE ONE IN NEED.

GET
SOME REST.

I WANT YOU TO GET
BETTER.

I'M WORKING ON
IT.

BEEN PRAYING ON IT EVERY
DAY.

ME, TOO.

GOOD
NIGHT, ROY.

HEY, ROY,

JUST IN CASE I DON'T GET TO
SEE YA,

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
RIGHT?

I LOVE YOU TOO

BUT UM, I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE

ATLEAST NOT
TONIGHT.



NARRATOR: AFTER ROY
LEFT FOR A WARMER CLIMATE,

THE REST OF THE FAMILY
FOLLOWED SUITE.

WALT HAD
NEVER KNOWN A TIME WHEN HE

HADN'T BEEN SURROUNDED BY
FAMILY.

BUT FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HIS LIFE

HE FELT
ENTIRELY ALONE.

HE FELT
LOST.

JUST WHEN HE NEEDED
THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILY

THE MOST,

THEY HAD ALL LEFT.

IT WAS THE SADDEST TIME IN
HIS LIFE.

WALT WAS ALWAYS
THE INNOVATOR

AND UBBE, THE
ARTIST.

MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE
NEVER GAVE UP.

HE JUST
COULDN'T.

HIS MIND NEVER RAN
OUT OF IDEAS.

BUT HE DID RUN
OUT OF MONEY.

UBBE: WALT?
YOU OKAY?

WALT: OH, HEY,
UBBE!

YEAH!

JUST WORKING ON
THE ALICE FILM.

YOU WANNA
HELP?

I WISH I COULD,
WALT.

I'VE GOT A JOB.

1JuUsT
CAME BY ON MY LUNCH BREAK

THOUGHT I COULD TELL YOU IN
PERSON.

I'M RESIGNING.

I'M REALLY SORRY, WALT.
BUT

I
NEED THE MONEY,

YOU
UNDERSTAND, DON'T 'CHA?

IT'S OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.

YOU'RE LIVING HERE,
WALT?

SLEEPING HERE,

YEAH. SPEND MOST OF MY TIME
HERE, ANYWAY.

IS ANYBODY ELSE WORKING
WITH YOU HERE?

NO. JUST ME

AND
MY FRIEND HERE.

UBBE, PEOPLE
HAVE TO MAKE MONEY

AND IT'S SOMETHING I DON'T
HAVE TO GIVE RIGHT NOW.

WHAT
ARE YOU LIVING ON, WALT?

NOT MUCH.

NOT MUCH,
UBBE.

HOW'S ROY DOING?

HAS HE GOTTEN ANY BETTER?

YEAH, HE'S GETTING
BETTER;

WELL ENOUGH TO
BADGER ME ABOUT HOW TO RUN

THINGS AROUND HERE.

HE THINKS I SHOULD FILE FOR
BANKRUPTCY

AND MOVE OUT
THERE TO CALIFORNIA.

ANIMATION IS BIGGER OUT
THERE,

AND HE SAYS THERE'S A
REAL MARKET FOR IT.

BUT, I MADE A COMMITMENT
WITH THE "ALICE" FILM,

AND I THINK I'M GONNA
TRY TO FINISH IT.

I THINK YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO
YOUR BROTHER, WALT.

HEY, I GOTTA
GET BACK.

WHAT'S THIS
FOR?

I JUST WANT YOU
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.

GOODBYE, WALT.

GOODBYE, UBBE.

[RUFFLING OF PAPER SACK]


[SOUND OF RUNNING PROJECTOR]






NARRATOR: MAYBE WALT FELT A
LITTLE LIKE ALICE;

LIONS CHOMPIN'
AT HIS HEELS,

AND NOTHING HE
COULD DO.

THIS WAS THE END
OF THE LINE, FOR SURE.

HE
HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.

HE PAWNED HIS CAMERA SO HE
COULD BUY A TRAIN TICKET TO

CALIFORNIA

TO BE WITH ROY.

TO START AGAIN.

IN A LOT OF
WAYS,

HE FELT LIKE HE WAS
JUM PING OFF A CLIFF TO AVOID

THE FEROCIOUS LIONS WAITING
TO EAT HIM UP.




[OPENING BOX]

[FUFFLING PAPERS]

WALT: I DON'T
WANT TO LEAVE YOU IN THERE

TO GET EATEN BY THAT CAT.

YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OUT HERE,

YOU'LL SEE.

IT'S
LIKE MY FRIEND,

DOC SHERWOOD, SAID
WHEN I WAS AKID, *

SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT
TO GIVE UP THE THINGS YOU

LOVE.

SOMETIMES IT MAKES
SENSE TO MOVE ON'.

IT HURTS
ME, TOO,

BUT THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD
OUT THERE FOR YOU TO SEE.

YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN
THE SAME PLACE FOR THE REST

OF YOUR LIFE, DO YOU?

Just
THINK OF THE ADVENTURES

YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISSING
OUT ON.

IT'S TIME TO GO,

FOR
BOTH OF US.

GOODBYE, LITTLE
FELLA.


SEE YA REAL SOON.

NARRATOR: NO MATTER HOW
BLEAK THINGS SEEMED, WALT

DISNEY NEVER GAVE UP. NOT
ONCE. FAILURE UPON FAILURE,

HE STILL BELIEVED IN
HIMSELF, IN HIS TALENTS. THE

FAITH IN HIS SOUL THAT HE
COULD ACHIEVE ANYTHING

IF HE
JUST PUT HIS MIND TO IT.

AFTER ALL HE'D BEEN THROUGH,

HE STILL WENT ON TOWARDS
LIFE'S NEXT ADVENTURE.

AND
THANK GOODNESS, HE DID.

HE WENT ON TO BECOME
SOMEONE SO SPECIAL,

SO INNOVATIVE,

SO
REMARKABLE.

WALT DISNEY WENT

ON TO BECOME A PIONEER IN
THE ART OF ENTERTAINMENT;

SPREADING JOY THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD,

CREATING MAGNIFICENT
DREAMS

IN THE MINDS OF
CHILDREN EVERYWHERE,

FILLING
HEARTS WITH HAPPINESS.

WHY,
WITHOUT THIS MAN,

THE WORLD WOULD HAVE A
LOT LESS SMILES.

YOU SEE DREAMERS
NEVER QUIT.

DREAMERS DO!


THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LADDERS
I HAVE CLIMBED

TO TRY TO REACH A DREAM
I'VE HAD IN MIND

AS I SCALED THEM RUNG
BY RUNG

THROUGH THE SONGS
THAT I HAVE SUNG

I'VE TRIED TO BRING SOME
HAPPINESS TO YOU *

CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
DREAMERS DO

THE STRUGGLES
THAT I'VE HAD ALONG THE WAY

HAVE ONLY MADE ME STRONGER
DAY BY DAY

AND EVEN THOUGH
IT WASN'T EASY

I NEVER
DOUBTED I'D PULL THROUGH

CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
DREAMERS DO

A DREAM CAN BE LIKE
THUNDER FROM THE CLOUDS

IT ECHOES THROUGH THE
CANYONS STRONG AND LOUD

AND IT CAN
CHASE AWAY A DARK SKY

WHEN A
RAY OF HOPE SHINES THROUGH

SO IN A DREAMER'S EYES THE
GREY SKIES ARE ALWAYS BLUE

THAT'S WHAT DREAMERS DO

OH,
THAT'S WHAT DREAMERS DO

I'D FOREVER JOURNEY
TIME AND SPACE

TO SIMPLY PUT A SMILE
UPON A FACE

AND EVEN IF IT
TOOK A LIFE TIME

TO MAKE
THAT WISH COME TRUE

THAT'S
WHAT DREAMERS DO

A DREAM CAN BE LIKE THUNDER
FROM THE CLOUDS

IT ECHOES THROUGH THE
CANYONS STRONG AND LOUD

AND IT CAN CHASE
AWAY A DARK SKY

WHEN A RAY OF HOPE SHINES
THROUGH

SO IN A DREAMER'S EYES THE
GREY SKIES ARE ALWAYS BLUE

THAT'S WHAT
DREAMERS DO

OH, THAT'S WHAT
DREAMERS DO
