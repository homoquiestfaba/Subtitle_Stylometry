(knock on door)

Can I help you?

I'm, um, Charlene.

Pray Tell's mother.

Can I come in and talk to you
for a minute?

Mother to mother.

(ice clinks)
I got some ice tea brewed.

Um, is-is that his...

Yes.

â™ª â™ª

I guess no pine box
on Hart Island for him, huh?

I'm, um, ashamed.

I know what you were to my son.

His best friend.

His sister.

Hmm.

His real mother.

What would Pray say now

if he could see the two of us
sitting here?


I think that might have been
the only thing

that might have ever
made him speechless.

Mm.

You know, I think it's best
you put any regret

about you and Pray away,
right now.

Or else that's all
you gonna think about of him

for the rest of your life.
I know. I know.

But what I wouldn't give
to get one more minute with him.

Well...

We got all the minutes
we gonna get.


I, uh...

I came here to ask you a favor.

Pray wrote a will,

and he gave his power
of attorney to my sister, Jada.

I had to practically
get on my knees and beg her

to let me fulfill
one of his last wishes.

I brought him into this world.

And...

Well, anyway. Thank the Lord
that she finally agreed.

But I can't fulfill that wish
without your help.

Oh, anything.

Just tell me what to do.

This is half of Pray's ashes.

I kept the other half
for myself.

You think
he'd be okay with that?

I think he would want that.

He left these
heart-shaped lockets.

(Blanca laughs softly)

He wants you to put a little
of him in each one,

and give it to those
who are most precious to him.

Whatever you have left,
you can do what you want.

Scatter them. Keep them.

You've got mother's rights too,
Blanca.

Mm-hmm.

I'll take care of everything.

He, uh...

He made this one for you.

It's beautiful.

May I...

put it on you?
Mm-hmm.


Thank you for loving my baby.

Well...

I better get out of here.
Okay.

Took up enough of your time.

Ch-Charlene, wait.

I can't have any more minutes
with Pray,

but I'm so glad
that I got to share

these few minutes with you.

(door opens)

(footfalls approach)

<i>PRAY TELL: The category is...</i>

<i>Live...</i>

<i>Work...</i>

<i>Pose!</i>

â™ª â™ª

These protease inhibitors
are a miracle.

I'm watching my patients
make full recoveries

from something
that would've otherwise

sent them to they graves.

We're calling it
"The Lazarus Effect."

The question is no longer,
"What do we do?"

but, "How do we do it?"

(all murmuring assent)
Right. Right. Exactly.

Some of us are lucky enough
to get into the trials,

but what about those
who can't afford

$10,000 a year for new meds?

It's the same fucking problem
we've always had.

Politicians and Big Pharma
are dragging their asses,

because our lives
mean nothing to them.

(cheering)
That's why we've got to take

this next protest
a step further.

(cheering, whooping)

Here's an idea. Here's an idea.

It's a radical step,
but it's a necessary one to get

these motherfuckers' attention,

because we will never
have their empathy

or compassion.
OTHERS: No.

So, we are gonna release
the ashes of those we've lost

onto the mayor's
fucking front lawn.

That way, he won't just see the
dead as just a number anymore.

Who here is willing
to make this kind of sacrifice?!

When my son died two days ago,

he asked me to drop his body
on the doorsteps of the FDA,

but I think this
can be even more powerful.

Count me in.

Me, too.
Yeah, let's do it!

Fuck yeah.
We got nothing to lose.

Okay, let's take a vote.

Who here thinks
that their loved ones

would want their ashes
to be a part of this history?

(others murmuring)
Guys, we have lost thousands

and thousands of people,

and they are just sitting...
WOMAN: Yes!

...in urns, inactive.

Well, if you ask me,

they were revolutionaries
who died for a cause.

ALL: Yeah!
They are calling out,

beyond the grave,
to be in service.

ALL: Yes!
And they want to be active

in our final fight.

(cheering)
Who is willing

to send one more message out
into the world?

To demand access to
these lifesaving meds

to stop the endless death?

(cheering, whooping)

I will. I will!

(cheering continues)

ALL (chanting):

ACT UP! ACT UP! ACT UP!
ACT UP! ACT UP!

ACT UP! ACT UP! ACT UP! ACT UP!

ACT UP! ACT UP!

ACT UP! ACT UP! ACT UP!

(horns honking in distance)

You okay?

Yeah, baby.

Everyone's here.

Y'all are probably wondering
why y'all here.

This was Pray's sanctuary.

His home.

Oh, we had some good times here.

And I couldn't think
of a more fitting place

to carry out his final wish.

Y'all were most precious to him.

And y'all gave him so much.

And he wanted to make sure
that each of you

have a little bit of him.

Thanks.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Um...

Originally,

Pray's instructions was
not to give you one of these.

But he was just playing around.


"Elektra...

"Elektra fights
every day to get what's hers,

"and maybe that looks
like a selfish act,

"but the truth is,

"every time Elektra
gets herself something,

"she shows all of us, the world,

"how much we are capable of.

How much we deserve."

He actually wrote down a little
something about all of you.

I guess it was back
when he was sure

that he didn't have
too long left.

Lulu.

He said you got a
real strength in you, girl.

(laughs)
And that sometimes,

when he was feeling like he
couldn't fight no more,

he would think of you,
and how you never took any shit

off no one.
And that made him laugh,

and it would get him
through the night.

And, Judy...


He said you actually
made him believe

in the goodness of white people.


And, Angel and Papi...

He never thought that so close
to home, in our neighborhood,

in our community,

he would ever see
the kind of romance and love

that he saw in the movies.

Real, true love.

And in these darkest times,

your love gave him hope
for the future.

And to the Great Council...

Manhattan, Castle and Jack.

He said...

"Fellas, we held
our crazy world together,

"the tribal chiefs, the four
pillars of the ballroom.

"Whatever legacy I leave behind,
I owe it to your friendship

and your commitment
to the magic of the balls."

And, Ricky.

To you he wrote,

"I was never old.

"I was never sick with you.

"I didn't have to be an emcee
on a stage or a father.

"In the best moments we shared,
there was no performance.

I was just me."

(sniffles, exhales)

What did Pray say to you, Ma?

Nothing.

There was nothing ever
left unsaid between us.


There's one more thing
we got to do.

Something that Pray never asked,

but I know he would want.

I didn't use all those ashes up
in those lockets.

We gonna use the rest of them,
and put them somewhere special.

(breathes deeply)

Candles are for birthday cakes.
Why you got to be so silly?

This is more important
than a birthday.

Because as of today,
my baby girl's

officially a nurse.

And on top of all of that,
it's our four-year anniversary.

Now, go on
and blow out that candle

before it drips
all over the place.

Go on, girl. You're so dramatic.

BLANCA: I got to make a wish.

So, it's carrot cake
and cream cheese?

Your favorite.

Thanks for understanding
about Saturday.

Of course. You got to do
what you got to do.

Do your thing.

We'll celebrate
our anniversary next weekend.

Okay.
But, in the meantime,

I'll just be thinking
of all the things you could do

to make it up to me.
You so nasty.

You love it?
I do.


You been up there
to see Judy yet?

Is she still working
up on the fourth floor?

Same floor.

It's a different gig though.

You should go up there
and say hey.

Show your face. She misses you.

And you get to see what
they've done with the place.

Since, you know, you done
left us for Saint Vincent's.


You're Saint Vincent's.
(laughs)

Think you, think you fancy now.
(laughs softly)

Okay, baby.
All right.

You have a good day at work.

And I'll see you later on
tonight?

Yes, you will. Yes, you will.

Come here.


Tasting like a cupcake.

I'm gonna be tasting
like that tonight.

Don't start nothin'.

Thank you.
Don't start nothin'.

Whew. Whew!

(babies crying)

<i>NURSE JUDY: Remember how I said</i>

I didn't become a nurse
to help people die?

Mm-hmm.

Well, look at me now.

I mean, it's so great
to come to work

knowing that life awaits me.

And the smell of babies?

It's my new happy place.
You know,

I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

They got all of this
brand-new equipment,

and they finally painted
these nasty-ass walls.

came up with a budget

for all sorts of things
once AIDS patients

didn't come in as often.
Mm-hmm.

are a fucking miracle.

I've never felt better.

I'm so proud that
you never gave up.

You're healthy.

You have a hot man.

(laughs)
A new job at Saint Vincent's.

Mm-hmm.

You're gonna live a very long
and happy life, Blanca.

You know, I didn't believe that
for the longest time, Judy.

But now,
I think you might be right.

That's why I volunteer.

I got to give back what was once
freely given to me.

I see Pray Tell looking
down at you, smiling.

Mm. I hear him all the time.

I do.

Sometimes he gives me advice.

And sometimes
he tells me a joke.

But most times
he gives me reassurance

that I'm taken care of and that
everything is gonna be okay.

Keep listening to him.

I do.

(babies crying)


Aren't they sweet?
They are beautiful.

Uh, patient 35117?

(phone ringing in distance)

(Blanca sighs)

Safaree,

you tested positive for HIV.

â™ª â™ª

Um... here.

Is there anyone you can call?

Friends? Family?

I just moved here
six months ago.

My parents don't speak
to me no more.

I ain't got no one.

Have you been working the pier?

I know it well.

You do?
Yeah.

I used to work there myself
when I was your age.

Back then, there were six piers.

And now there's only one.

Look.

When I found out
that I was HIV positive,

there weren't any
drugs that were available.

AIDS was a death sentence.

But now people are living
long and healthy lives,

as long as we keep
taking our meds

and listening
to what the doctors say.

You're HIV positive?
I am.

And I'm proof
you are gonna be okay,

if you follow the protocols.

I can't afford all that.
Well, see,

that's why I'm here to help.

I am gonna help you
get signed up

for the AIDS
Drug Assistance Program.

Depending on your income,

you might not even have to pay
a penny for your health care.

And let me tell you something.

You are gonna be okay.

How about this?

There is a function happening

on Saturday night.

Something I think
you might enjoy.

It's where I found my community.

And where I found my hope.

("Love Like This"
by Faith Evans playing)

â™ª <i>I never knew there was a</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Love like this before</i> â™ª

(Blanca and Angel vocalizing)

â™ª <i>Never had someone</i>
<i>to show me a love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Love like this before...</i> â™ª

Looks like we aren't
the only ones who had the idea

for a ladies' lunch.

Well, it is
the<i> Sex and the City</i> effect.

These ladies all came
into the city to have sex?

(Lulu snorts)
You ever seen<i> Sex and the City?</i>

BLANCA:
Yeah, girl.
You ain't got HBO?

LULU: Yeah, you loaded.

I figured
you would have splurged

on the premium movie package
by now.

Right.
Showtime, HBO, Cinemax.

(laughter)
BLANCA: Word.

Rich girl.

I don't have television
in my penthouse.

It rots your brain
and turns it to Cream of Wheat.

Okay, look. I have to be honest,
I tried watching that show.

And first of all, I ain't never
seen women talk about sex

as much as they do.

And second of all,
they need to call it

<i>Being White and the City.</i>

'Cause ain't none of them girls
got a Black

or Latina friend.
ANGEL: Not one.

Not even a sidekick.
ELEKTRA: Mm.

Let me guess, Cosmopolitan?

Thank you. Yes, I am.

(laughter)
Bitch, a Cosmo is a drink

that the
<i>Sex and the City</i> ladies love.

I'll have a real drink.

Johnny Walker on the rocks.

Blue Label if you have it.

Bring four, actually.

I refuse to let
some TV show about white girls

define how we eat, drink
and gather as girlfriends.

We've always made our own rules,

and we ain't stopping now.

I know that's right.
Heard that.

Mm-hmm.

I told those mafia gentlemen,

I know men.

I know what turns them on.

Yes, phone sex was lucrative,

but only because
there wasn't a better option.

Now there is.

Webcam interactions.

Remove the need
for the imagination

and you can charge
twice the price.

That alone pays for my condo
in Boca Raton.

Darlings, I was rich before,

but now if I drop a
thousand dollars on the street,

I don't even bother
wasting time to pick it up.

ANGEL: Ooh...
Well, you talking real tough,
Elektra.

But I know you quietly
giving money to those hospitals

and those
drug-treatment facilities

to help the girls.
LULU: Mm-hmm.

And she's paying for hormones
and surgeries, too.

A regular transsexual
Robin Hood.

(Lulu laughing)
Shh! Don't be so loud, ladies.

I have a reputation as a cold,
hard bitch to uphold.

Okay, well, if you ever decide
you need a new accountant

to deal with the money
you actually declare

to the government, give me
a call, because First Manhattan

just moved me over to
their tax department.

BLANCA: What?
And I am helping people
with their taxes now.

What? Lulu, that is incredible.
Congratulations.

So bougie, in a good way.
BLANCA: Right.

Well, what about you, Angel?
What's your update?

My baby started third grade.

-Okay. -Oh. -Mm-hmm.

You know,
being a full-time mother is...

It's just the most craziest,

most beautiful thing
in the world.

I make breakfast for him
every morning.

It's just cereal and milk,
but...

Oh, girl.
I put a napkin out
and everything. Okay?

You wake up before noon?
Every day.

Okay.
Except Sunday, that's Mommy's
morning to sleep in.

I heard that.

And Papi's getting me back
in the game, y'all.

They putting me on a bottle
of this new hairspray

that's for real thick,
curly hair, just like ours.
Oh...

I'm-a get y'all bottles.

Oh, my God. I forgot
to tell y'all about Damon.

He sent me a letter, y'all.
LULU: Really?

Yes. Yeah, he's in Chicago,

living with some nice man
who's got three dance studios

that he teaches in.

And he wanted me
to send y'all all his love.

ALL: Oh...

Well, that's lovely.
He has a sugar daddy.

Oh, my God.
Mm-hmm.

And we all know about you,
Mother Blanca.

A real, official nurse.

Educated, graduated
and certified by the state.

Who would have guessed
that you would have found a way

to monetize your annoyingly
endless kindness

for your fellow man.

I am so proud of you.

My heart. My Blanca.


Happy endings are for movies.

We done been through too much
pain to fool ourselves

into thinking that all the bad
is in the past,

but I do believe in...
happy moments.

Sometimes they last a minute,
sometimes a year.

But when they come... ooh,

you just got to recognize
and celebrate, so...

Here's to all of our
happy moments together.

Not only did we survive,
but we are thriving.

Cheers.
Amen. Clink, clink,
clink, clink, clink.

Cheers, Mama.
Yes.

Mm.

Oh, shit. Look, I got to go.

I got to help these kids get
ready for the ball tonight.

Ay, Mother Blanca
and her children already?

Okay, listen. These kids
are trophy-winning machines.

Why do you insist on going back
to that sweaty, airless room?

Can't you see
we've all outgrown it?

Elektra, you know you can't
outgrow your family.

Besides, you got to remember
why the balls started

in the first place.

They were a place for all of us
to be all of them things

that we weren't
allowed to be out in the world.

All right, how many times
have we walked Businesswoman?

And now you a real one, Elektra.

Or Runway, Miss Angel.

And now you actually walk
the real runways.

We weren't pretending
when we walked those categories,

we were preparing.

Faking it until we made it.

And more than anything,

we made a statement.

That we deserve to dream
and have our dreams fulfilled.

When we were walking
those balls,

we beared witness
to our possibilities.

And we say to each other,
"Yeah, girl, I see you.

I see who you are
and who you can be."

And then the outside world,
they tell us to hide.

But in the balls...

they tell us to strut.

We can never give up
on the balls.

LULU:
Blanca, that is so beautiful,

but I can't make it tonight,
girl.

But I promise
I'm-a come by soon.

It's tax season, girl.

You understand.

Okay. Angel?

Hmm?
Hmm.

Oh, no, my baby, uh,
he got the sniffles.

I got to go home
and take care of my child.

Sweaty, airless...

No.

Okay, look. I know y'all busy,

and y'all have your own lives,

but can we do this again soon?

Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.

Of course, come on.
Yes, of course.

I love each and every
last one of you.

Even you, Mother Elektra.

Especially me.

Whatever.
(laughter)

ANGEL: Bye. I love you.
LULU: Love you, girl.

I'll see you.
ELEKTRA: See you,
Mother Teresa.

Ooh.

(muffled cheering)
â™ª<i> How did you</i> â™ª

(cheering)
â™ª<i> Get here?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Nobody's supposed to be here</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Nobody's supposed to be here</i> â™ª


â™ª<i> How did you get here?</i> â™ª
â™ª<i> Yeah, yeah</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>No, nobody</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>No, no, no, no, no</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Nobody's supposed</i>

(muffled music playing)

Excuse me. Sorry.

Ooh, you look good, boo-boo.

Ooh, definitely wear this, baby.

Hi, Mama. Oops, sorry.

Dionne, you're late.

Now, if you're
gonna be an Evangelista,

you got to follow my rules.

Early is on time.

And on time is late. I know.

I'm sorry, Father.

I don't need your words.
I want action.

If Father can leave rehearsal
with Destiny's Child early,

you have no excuses.

But Grandma Blanca
was late, too.

Um, excuse me, Miss Thing.

I had all my finery intact
when I got into my cab ride.

Thank you very much.

And when was it okay

for y'all to call
y'all grandmother out?

You know what they say.

Snitches get stitches!

Okay. You need to talk
to these children.

Look at this. Look.

You all are Evangelistas.

Now, this house is known

for more than just
slaying a category.

We... all of us... are a family.

Now, what's my number-one rule?

Evangelistas always show up.

OTHERS: For each other.

No questions asked.
RICKY: That's right.

Rule number two...

Show up for yourself.

BLANCA:
All right, y'all. Come here.

I got something to say.

Each of you came into
the city to find yourselves,

and look at you,
you found each other.

You're part of a legacy.

A chosen family rooted in love,
loyalty and support.

That's right.
Right?

Don't ever forget,
if you get lost,

love will lead you back
to your house.

Now get out there
and show ballroom

the glory of being a what?

ALL: Evangelista!

All right.
RICKY: And please...

let my future man
be out there watching.

(laughs)
In Jesus' name. Amen!

-Amen. -Hallelujah. -Amen.

<i>TYRONE: Are y'all ready?</i>

ALL: Yeah!
(cheering)

For the new, reimagined,
House of Evangelista!

We gonna start off
with the first category, Face.

We got Dionne Evangelista here.

We see you. Yeah!

She's giving cheekbones.
She's giving chin.


â™ª <i>We go deep...</i> â™ª

All right, all right. Up next,

we got Femme Queen Realness.

â™ª <i>Until the early light...</i> â™ª

That's it right there.
It's real,

it's femme and it's queen-like.

â™ª <i>Tonight...</i> â™ª

Oh, we got Justice.

Justice, no peace.


This is bizarre!

I don't know
what the fuck it is,

but I like it. Oh, shit!

Oh, we got Vogue.

We got Teena. Gorgeous!

Yes. Give it to us, Teena Marie!

Give it to us. Give it to us.
Get it. Get it!

Get it! Get it! Get it!

That's it right there.

Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!

Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!


Go, go!

â™ª <i>We go deep...</i> â™ª

Ah, that's a bad bitch
right there. Get it! Oh!

â™ª <i>Up all night until</i>

Yes, bitch!

Up in here looking like
Lil' Kim!

You got it going on. What-what?!


â™ª <i>All night...</i> â™ª

All right, all right, all right.
Who's finished

with their scores?
What do we got? We got a ten,

ten, ten, ten, ten.

Tens across the board!

â™ª <i>We go deep and we don't...</i> â™ª

The House of Evangelista.

Give it to 'em, y'all.

One love!
Give these babies their trophy.

â™ª <i>We go deep</i>
<i>and we don't get no sleep</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause we be up all night</i>
<i>until the early light</i> â™ª

Ain't they cute?
â™ª<i> We go.</i> â™ª


All right, all right,
all right, all right.

Settle on down. Settle on down.
Sit your ass down.

We got a special moment
of the night about to happen.

We have a very special guest

to present
a very important award.

-(mouthing)
-I would like to introduce
the legend,

the one, the only...

The only bitch
who makes Diana Ross

look like her ass shops at Ross.


Ha-ha!
Elektra Abundance Evangelista.


(crowd cheering loudly)

Thank you
for that very warm greeting.

(cheering continues)

Ballroom is home.

Ballroom is family.

Ballroom is love.

And if it weren't
for this community,

I wouldn't be where I am today.

(scattered cheering)
I wouldn't be who I am,

if it weren't for
the many women, my sisters,

who lifted me up
when I couldn't do it myself.

As Tyrone observed, correctly,

yes, I am an icon.

But that didn't happen
overnight.

I worked hard to leave
an indelible statement.

I know the work and sacrifice
it takes to become a legend.

To be a legend isn't simply

about competing
and collecting trophies.

It's about how you
represent this community.

And I have seen this woman
work tirelessly,

not only for family,
but for all of us.

I am proud
to call her my daughter

and to finally...

bestow legendary status

on the one and only...
(whooping)

my baby girl...

Blanca Evangelista!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(crowd cheering, whooping)

â™ª â™ª

(crowd cheering)

â™ª â™ª

CROWD (chanting): Evange...

lista!

Evange-lista!

Evange...

lista!

Evange-lista!
(rhythmic clapping)

What?!
Evange-lista!

(whooping)
Evange-lista!

Evange-lista!

(rhythmic clapping)
Evange-lista!

Evange-lista!

What-what?!
TYRONE: All right,
all right, all right.

That's cute. We thank you
so much, Evangelista.

ALL: Evange...

So, now we gonna
take a little break

and then we gonna get right back
to this shit, all right?

I didn't have
anything special to wear.

Don't worry. We got you.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, y'all. Listen up.

This y'all new sister, Safaree.

All right, and look, we got to
help her get backstage quickly.

So, Justice, dust this mug.

And, Teena, pull something
sickening from that rack.

Wait, wait.
Wait, what's going on?

Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
You walking your first ball.

Welcome to
The House of Evangelista.

(chuckles nervously)

Come on, take her. Let's go.
TEENA: You ready?

Okay.
(laughter)

â™ª â™ª

(laughter)
Mama.

(footfalls echoing)

<i>PRAY TELL:</i>
<i>Girl, what are you</i>
<i>still doing here?</i>

I thought you were staying
all night.

No, I...

I was just...

(Blanca laughs softly)

Good night.

<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

<i>PRAY TELL:
The category is Love, y'all!</i>

SWAN: The judges was definitely

on some bullshit tonight.

There's no way we should have
lost every category.

Hey, Blanca.

I got a question for the legend.

This is the third ball
we leaving empty-handed.

What we got to do
to snag us some trophies?

<i>PRAY TELL: Well, well, well.</i>

Look at the sad queens.

Disappointed about our scores,
are we?

This ain't gonna be
the first time you lose,

and it sure won't be the last.

Ain't no secrets
or shortcuts to success.

You just... you keep trying.

What if you
want to give up, though?

â™ª <i>Turn me up, turn me up...</i> â™ª

And you feel ain't no reason
to keep going?

You think this would've
ever happened if I gave up?

You the house mother?

Mm-hmm.

Look around.

You want a reason to continue?

It's standing right there
in front of you.

<i>PRAY TELL:
There it is, right there.</i>

Houses are homes
to all the little boys and girls

who never had one.

And they gonna keep coming here.

To New York City.
Sure as the sun rises.

So, what you got to do is...

Work harder.

Reach higher.

And dream big until you...

<i>PRAY TELL: Triumph.</i>

Until you triumph.

It won't happen today,
but one day.

â™ª <i>Like I want to go home...</i> â™ª

And when you do,

I'm-a be right in there...

...cheering you on.

â™ª <i>It's all right</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> Love that</i> â™ª
â™ª<i> Y'all, it's all right</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause your love is my love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And my love is your love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It would take an eternity</i>
<i>to break us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And the chains of</i> Amistad
<i>couldn't hold us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause your love is my love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And my love is your love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It would take an eternity</i>
<i>to break us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And the chains of</i> Amistad
<i>couldn't hold us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause your love is my love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And my love is your love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It would take an eternity</i>
<i>to break us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And the chains of</i> Amistad
<i>couldn't hold us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Cause your love is my love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And my love is your love</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>It would take an eternity</i>
<i>to break us</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And the chains of</i> Amistad
<i>couldn't hold us.</i> â™ª
