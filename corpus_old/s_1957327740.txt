[ Silence ]

One year ago, I was just like

you... working two jobs, trying

to make ends meet, worried about

money all the time.

One night, my wife says to me,

"Rob, we can't live like this.

We can't live like this."

You know what I'm talking about.

Living hand to mouth, minute to

minute, second to second.

So I went out and I looked at

dozens of network-marketing

companies.

And I found only one that could

provide my family with the

security it so deserves...

Vitafuture vitamins with

Australian blue-green algae.

I only need to see him for

five minutes.

Look, he's a little busy right

now.

Can you please ask him to

come out and talk to me?

What do you want from me?

He's got a roomful of people.

Look, Rob said if I couldn't

sell them, he would give me back

my $2,000.

Look, Rob's going right to

the Danvers seminar.

My customers saw the story

they did on channel 7.

Now everyone wants to return

their products.

Let me handle this.

Look, all returns... they go

through corporate.

Corporate is not accepting

returns anymore!

Lower your voice.

I have in my hand...

Let tell you why...

[ Clatter ]

Call corporate.

They'll sort it out.

Oy! Too slow!

[ Both laugh ]

Too slow!

[ Laughs ]

Too slow.

Raymond, when you're older,

you have to start taking care of

me better.

Why won't they let you return

the vitamins?

Because they are all thieves.

Too slow.

[ Laughs ]

We should call the police.

How about you, huh?

So quick.

Get in the car.

Uh-huh.

So, uh...

No good?

[ Car doors close ]

[ Man speaking Chinese dialect ]

Sorry, it's time.

I know.

We're trying to hurry.

Okay, it's almost noon.

Mm-hmm.

[ Man speaking Chinese ]

Raymond, why is the police

here?

That's my kitty shirt.

It's too small for you.

But maybe I want it.

For what?

Just to have it, Raymond,

to put on a pillow or something.

Uh, on the curb.

We should bring skirtsy.

Mom...

Can we bring skirtsy?

Huh?

It's too big.

Mom, why is the police here?

They are making sure no one

takes our things.

[ Men conversing in Chinese ]

[ Airplane engines roaring

[ overhead ]

[ Birds chirping ]

Hi!

Hey, Michael.

Hi, kids.

Hey, Michael!

There's more parking down the

street.

[ Keys jingling ]

[ Lock clicks ]

The owners are in Taiwan.

They're still trying to raise

money to finish the building.

How long can we stay?

Five months at least.

And it's only 30 minutes to

Boston.

Is there electricity?

I'll turn on the fuse box.

Now, once a month, some people

might come... electricians,

inspectors, you know.

But, um, other than that, it's

all yours.

Keep the shades drawn at night.

Try not to make that much noise.

[ Chuckles ]

This apartment isn't zoned for

living yet.

There's no phone.

So, good?

[ Chuckles ]

Thank you.

Come work for me again.

Don't get sucked into retail.

Look what happened with those

vitamins.

By the time we start selling

these apartments, you'll have

your license.

[ Zipper unzipping ]

Raymond, put your toys in the

bedroom.

They're not toys.

It's fake.

How's dad gonna call?

We'll call him on Sunday,

like we always do.

Mom, does anyone live here?

Mom?

What?

How long do we have to stay

here?

Just for a little while.

Is someone gonna live in our

house?

I don't want anyone to live

in our house!

Raymond.

Don't worry.

No one's going to live in our

house.

If I sell some houses and work

for Michael, then we can move

back.

This way, no one can see the

lights are on.

[ Air hissing ]

[ Birds chirping,

[ vehicle approaching ]

Sorry to call you so early.

I'm calling about the business

opportunity I saw advertised via

your flier.

Uh, which one?

Uh...

How many do you have?

Uh, for the hair products.

Oh.

Okay, you don't car... okay.

Okay.

Th... thank you.

Hello, uh, my name is

Elaine Cheng, and, uh, Iâ€™m

calling because I'm interested

in becoming a marketing

executive for your

direct-marketing plan.

Uh, you can page me back at

617...

Hello, my name is Elaine Cheng,

and I'm calling about the

network-marketing opportunity I

saw advertised via your flier.

[ Door opens, closes ]

[ Sighs ]

Stay with your class until they

call us.

But I want to wait with you.

Put these in your bag.

Raymond, Tina.

Uh, someone's here to pick you

up.

I'll be going by

video planet, in case you want

anything.

Maybe something for the kids and

something for us?

I am.

I'm driving them to baseball,

but this nice Asian-American

girl asked if I could drop her

kids off at her house, so we'll

be going by there.

I met her at parents' night.

She got my number then.

Is this it?

You can take that with you if

you want.

Say hi to your mom for me.

Plastic wrap.

Uh, takeout container.

Uh, water bottle.

And marbles.

[ Marbles rattling ]

[ Clatter ]

Sorry.

My other showing ran late.

Didn't Michael tell you to wait

inside?

It's all right.

We are old.

Don't worry about us.

Sit in front.

Otherwise, you get carsick.

I'm fine.

After you saw this listing

last time, the seller did some

repairs.

[ Woman breathing deeply ]

Are you feeling carsick?

She's not used to riding in

the back.

I told you you'd get carsick.

Uh, there's bags on the back

of the chair.

[ Panting ]

[ Retching ]

So, uh...

The closest subway is a commuter

rail.

We have the same thing where I

live.

It works.

[ Tapping ]

[ Tapping continues ]

Hey, guys, make sure to check

the breakers in the hall, and,

uh, after that, check the fuse

box in apartment 10.

All right, I got you.

[ Pager beeping ]

I'm hungry.

Mom's gonna bring food

back.

Tomorrow's family day.

What do you want to do?

Mom may have to go to the

office.

Mom never works on family

day.

Yes, she does.

You just don't see it.

She does work while we're

playing.

I see it.

Raymond, I'm still hungry.

You're always hungry.

You're going to get fat.

Shut up, Raymond!

[ Water runs ]

Hello?

Hi, uh, this is Elaine Cheng.

I received a page on my beeper.

Hi. Yes.

You called about our business

opportunity this morning?

[ Lock clicks ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

Can't sleep?

Did something happen?

Raymond says... Raymond says

even if we make enough money, he

wants to live here so we don't

have to pay rent.

[ Chuckles ]

Let mommy worry about that.

Do you want something to eat?

Go wash your hands.

Are you hungry, Raymond?

Did they buy the house?

Nope.

[ Sighs ]

What are we gonna do for

family day?

We have a party to go to.

Really? What party?

It's just a friend thing.

But it's at night.

We can do anything you want

during the day.

I want to go to the mall, and

Raymond wants to go to the toy

store.

Maybe we can go see our house,

too.

Why do you want to see our

old house?

Just to see it.

I never read that sign

before.

I want to eat that bowl of

whipped cream.

Don't put your hands on

there.

But I want it.

You already have so many of

those.

Not one like these, Raymond.

They're only $1 for two.

That's cheap.

Do you want mommy to buy

those for you?

[ Video games beeping ]

Hey, kid, you're gonna have

to let somebody else play.

Uh, hi, Felicia.

Uh, did the chows call?

If they are not interested in

432 Washington, tell them don't

worry.

Uh, today, I will contact some

other listings they might like.

Uh, this is Elaine.

Thank you.

Hi, uh, this is Elaine Cheng

from lucky real estate.

How are you?

[ Video game beeping ]

Ready?

Uh, almost.

Come on, Raymond. Let's go.

Can I just play for a couple

more minutes?

Hi, are you the mom?

Mm-hmm.

They were here for a really

long time today.

[ Chuckles ]

Okay.

Are you gonna buy that?

No.

Mom...

Was that guy mad at us?

Look.

Maybe someday we will live here.

[ Insects chirping ]

[ Indistinct conversations ]

It's been a while, hasn't it?

Thank you.

Oh, honey, I have someone I

want you to meet.

Excuse us.

Hi.

Hi. Hi, you must be Elaine.

Yes. Hi.

Hi, I'm Betty.

[ Slowly ] You must be

Elaine's kids.

I just met your mother.

She seems very nice.

Would you like to go play with

the other children?

The other... the other kids, the

other children.

Why are you talking like

that?

I have someone I'd like you

to meet.

This is Elaine.

Hi.

Hi.

And this is Rosemary and

Nancy.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Hopefully she's gonna be

working with us.

Oh! Wonderful.

Mm-hmm.

Betty was telling me all

about gold rep.

Oh, gold rep is wonderful.

You're going to enjoy it very

much.

Make lots of money.

I would like the three of you

to conquer the Chinese market.

Both: Oh, you're Chinese!

So, the boys are in this

room.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

And the girls are in this room.

You can't have breakaway

systems in multilevel marketing.

Doesn't make any sense.

Well, it worked for

bauerstar.

How many levels were you paid

on?

Well, we were the ones

breaking away.

How many levels were you paid

on?

The products are one thing...

Amazing.

But it's really more than that.

It's, um... it's a community.

It's women helping women.

And you, Dennis.

[ Laughs ]

Why are you even here?

[ Laughs ]

Dennis and I used to work

vibracream together.

From Hong Kong?

Uh, I-I came over for

college.

Ah.

My mom also got me the hat

for Samantha.

I have the other one.

Not the blue one.

I really like her necklace.

Thanks.

You're not supposed to eat on

the bed.

This is a new one my mom

bought.

It's very sparkly.

[ Imitating explosions ]

Gold rep is very popular with

the Chinese and Vietnamese

population in Springfield, but

we haven't broken into the

Boston market yet.

Nancy and Rosemary... they'd be

your team leaders.

How long does it take to make

money?

Well, it depends on you.

Most people get checks their

first week.

[ Both laugh ]

Oh, I know.

I didn't believe it at first,

either.

The payment structure extends

through to the ninth level, see?

Programs like nutravite and

ultra life... they use front-end

loading.

We don't do any of that.

The products are for, you know,

early adopters... you know, life

improvement, sharper image

stuff.

The membership fee is $2,500?

That is a one-time payment

only.

Keeps the dabblers out.

Trust me... when you get those

first couple of payments, you

will thank your lucky stars new

members pay that much.

I can show you the checks.

[ Laughs ]

I...

I-I don't have the money to

join.

Um...

I'm hoping there will be a

closing soon in real estate,

but...

Right now...

[ Chuckles ]

I know it's hard.

When we joined, Kyle and I were

living in a one-bedroom

apartment in Somerville.

We had to scrape together the

membership fee.

But you have to take the leap

sometime, right?

I can do it.

Good. So...

What does your husband do?

Uh, he...

Went back to Hong Kong last

year.

Uh, but we are divorced.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I was working when he was in

engineering school and after.

Now I'm starting again.

[ Chuckles ]

Mom?

What's wrong?

I want to go home.

We cannot go home yet.

Go play with your brother.

He says he wants to play with

the other kids.

Go back outside.

I will be out in a second.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Indistinct conversations ]

[ Instrumental music plays ]

Mom...

You sold some of these things

before.

Why did you leave Tina alone

at the party?

Because I was doing stuff.

You are the oldest, and you

are her brother.

She doesn't know anyone there.

Are we gonna do this program?

You need to help me take care

of Tina better.

Do you understand?

Do you understand, Raymond?

Yeah. I understand.

[ Sighs ]

We need some money first...

For the membership fee.

Tina! Raymond!

Have you been good?

Uh-huh.

Look at those cheeks.

[ Laughs ]

It's $2,500 to get started,

but that's normal for network

marketing.

And it only takes one week to

get your first check, so I could

pay you back right away.

Someone from church said

you're working for a real-estate

company?

Oh, showing some houses at

night.

Who's gonna buy a house from

a woman?

I wouldn't buy a house from a

woman.

When you were selling skin

cream, that was better for you.

This program, gold rep, they

have beauty products and lots

of...

All my money is in stocks

right now.

I can't get to any of it.

Put your money in something

worthwhile.

[ Gasps ]

Raymond, I didn't have a chance

to give you this before your

birthday.

Here you go.

Now, make sure your mommy puts

it in your bank account, okay?

Dim sum.

[ Loudly ] Dim sum!

[ Telephone dialing ]

Hi, dad.

Raymond, he cannot hear you

when you do that.

I'm okay.

Just finished eating.

Do you want to talk to Tina?

Sure.

Hi, dad.

We're at great-grandpa's house.

When are you coming to Boston?

Work is really busy right

now.

Maybe we can go see you in

Providence.

Dad, how far is Providence?

Uh... 100 miles, maybe.

That's not that far.

Mom wants to talk to you.

Talk to you next week.

Love you. Bye.

Charles, did you send the

money yet?

Hello?

Elaine?

[ Static crackling ]

Elaine?

Where are you?

It's hard to hear.

I'm driving now.

[ Static crackling ]

Charles, are you there?

I'll wire the money sometime

this month.

You said that last month.

I'm waiting to get paid for

this new account.

Everything's all backed up.

They foreclosed on the house.

Why?

Why do you think?

I sent you some money in may.

You should have used that.

You only sent over half of

what the court ordered.

It was not enough.

And you did not send it in may.

You sent it in march.

We need money right now.

Stop yelling or I will hang up.

[ Receiver clicks ]

Hi.

Betty, this is Elaine Cheng.

Uh, let's talk next month.

I will have the money by then.

Not right now, no.

I-I have a lot of leads from

real estate and from my old

programs.

I can work gold rep.

I know I can.

Next month, I promise.

Yes.

Okay.

Uh...

What do you have in mind?

[ Beeping ]

Go and play.

Mom has a meeting to go to.

Raymond.

This is all your bank stuff,

okay?

How much is in it?

$500.

Grandma's new year and birthday

money.

Can we use it so you can join

Betty's thing?

If I use any of your money,

I'll put it back, I promise.

That's yours.

It's for you and Tina for

college.

But maybe if we use it now,

we can make more money.

[ Sighs ]

Both: Hi.

Is Betty parking the car?

Betty is busy.

The company is restructuring its

payment plan.

She sent me.

Whatever you said at the party

worked.

She can't stop talking about

you.

Really?

Betty wants to cover your

membership fee until you get

your first couple of checks.

Then you can pay her back, all

right?

I won't let Betty down.

I have read all the materials,

and I know all the products by

heart.

These are the distributor

agreements.

Congratulations.

Mrs. Cutter's picking you up

from school.

This is important, okay?

Hi, Michael, this is Elaine.

Uh, everything is going fine,

uh, but, uh, something has come

up for the next week, so I won't

be able to help you show houses.

You said you've done some sales

before?

Yes.

So... so these products are

so easy to sell, they will sell

themselves.

All you have to do is sign up

and pay a one-time membership

fee of $2,500.

But don't worry.

It's very easy to make back in

just one week.

And, uh, once you make that

back, then you really start to

see the profit.

So, uh, the $2,500, even

though, uh... It is something

that you pay up front as a

membership fee, you can make it

back almost immediately.

Uh, what happens is when you

recruit new people, you become

their upline and so forth.

Right. Okay, I understand.

Okay, so, the membership fee,

like I said, is the $2,500,

which, uh, is made up very, very

quickly.

But it's not guaranteed.

Well, there's no guarantees

in life, but this is something

where the odds are very much in

your favor.

What do you think?

I don't know.

Uh...

I'm thinking.

I think my husband is gonna kill

me, but...

[ Laughs ]

I'll do this.

I do... I'll do this.

Great, great, great.

It's for me, so...

Yeah, absolutely.

That's great.

So you feel ready to sign?

Maybe want to just give it a

couple days to think about and

sleep on it.

Yeah, you can continue to

think about it.

Do you remember what happened

to Stacy?

Well, is there any other way

that we can make this happen

besides the... the up-front

money?

A check for you.

Thank you.

Oh, thank you.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

Hi, would you like a flier?

Make some extra money.

Thank you.

Hi, sir.

Can I offer you a flier?

Thank you.

Yes. Make some extra money.

"R" as in "red," "e" as in

"elephant," "p" as in "person."

Okay, uh, how many more letters

do I get in my ad?

You can show this to all the

clients.

Um, and I find most people can

find something that they have

interest in here, they can use

themselves.

We have an entire warehouse that

stores all the products.

Come on!

Sit in back.

All my stuff is here.

Why weren't you waiting with the

other kids?

You know I'm busy today.

Are we going home?

I don't have time to drop you

off.

If we get two more customers, we

will get a check tomorrow.

We could have asked Dean's

mom.

She already dropped you off

twice this week.

Cannot ask her every day.

Can we see our house tonight?

You said we could see it last

week, but we didn't.

So, these are all of our

products.

Uh, I would be glad to answer

any questions you have.

So, what do you think?

Well, we're very interested.

How do we start?

If you sign up right now, I

can get all your info to my

upline tonight.

You will be a member by Monday.

I don't know.

I don't think we have that kind

of money.

But we can borrow some of

it... from uncle James, maybe.

We are already asking for so

much.

His daughter babysits for you

every single day.

Oh, you have kids?

Yeah, I just had a baby in

march, so it's a little...

He knows you don't have the

money to pay for a babysitter,

and now you're gonna spend

$2,500 to join this program.

I know it seems like a lot of

money, but you have to spend

money to make it sometimes.

Hmm?

Is this program run by

Chinese people or white people?

Mom, I don't think you're

allowed to ask that question.

It's okay.

Uh, white.

Chinese people, you know,

always, always looking for

short cut, don't think things

through all the way.

They only want to see the money

in front of them.

Uh, no, it's all run by

Americans.

Thank you.

[ Chuckles ]

Uh...

Phil?

Uh, Elaine?

Yeah. Uh, hi.

Elaine Cheng.

Good to meet you.

So, many of the ladies enjoy,

uh, all the, uh, beauty products

we offer in the catalog.

Oh, really?

I see a couple of the ones you

have right here.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Skin cream, but that's for

men and women, right?

Oh, uh, men... men can use

it, also.

Uh...

If you take a look here.

Many women are impressed with,

uh...

Miss, are you a guest at the

hotel?

I, uh...

Stayed here once before.

I'm sorry.

This isn't an office.

Okay.

[ Chuckles ]

Hi, mom!

What are you doing?!

Are you guys okay?

I need to sign this last person.

We will be home soon.

[ Beep ]

Ow! Raymond!

I told you to stop kicking

me.

I wasn't kicking you.

You were kicking me.

Your feet are so fat, you didn't

even know.

I wasn't kicking you!

Tina, go outside and sit by

the copier.

Raymond started it!

He pushed me!

Go outside!

Raymond!

I didn't do anything.

[ Sighs ]

Tina, I said sit down by the

copier!

I am sitting by the copier!

There!

You cannot just draw on things!

This is an office!

[ Sighs ]

When are we going to see the

house?

What?

When are we gonna see the

house?

You said we were gonna see it.

We will go after I drop this

off at Betty's house.

Mom, Tina wants to see our

old house.

Mom?

Tina is asleep already.

Come on.

Where are we?

We're home.

You said we were gonna look

at our house.

It got too late, and you fell

asleep.

I wasn't asleep early before

we went to the office.

Tina, stop whining.

But you promised!

You can't promise and not do it!

It's not fair!

I want to go now.

Mommy's been awake since 5:00

this morning.

Go to sleep.

You and Raymond have to wake up

early tomorrow.

Why?

[ Sighs ]

I have a meeting tomorrow.

I don't want to go to a

presentation!

I don't want to go!

It's not a presentation.

Betty's going to give us our

first check.

It will be a big party.

I don't want to go to any

more parties!

I don't want to go!

Shh!

Don't yell while you're in

the house.

[ Screams ]

Stop it!

[ Sighs ]

[ Door opens, closes ]

[ Whimpering ]

[ Air hissing ]

[ Sighs ]

Where's mom?

You said you didn't want to

go, so now we're staying home.

But we were supposed to go

with her.

Rosemary.

I'm at the hotel.

Where are you guys?

Uh, and did something come up

yesterday?

It's okay.

I did the presentation by

myself.

Uh, page me when you get this,

okay?

Bye.

Hi, Betty.

Uh, did you get the paperwork I

left at your door last night?

Uh...

I will be driving through

Lexington later.

Maybe I will just stop by.

Uh, if you get this, you can

page me.

Okay.

Bye.

[ Sighs ]

[ Knock on door ]

[ Muffled rock music playing ]

[ Music growing louder ]

Can I help you?

Yes, I'm just...

I'm a business associate of

Betty Cardellini.

Where you going?

I have to go now.

No, just a second.

Just a second.

I have to go now.

She's running! She's running!

She's running!

[ Door opens ]

Aah!

Is mom gonna bring any food

back?

Let's just eat ramen and go to

bed.

I have to finish this.

If mom comes home and we're

not asleep, she'll be mad.

She's gonna be mad anyway.

Raymond, wake up.

Raymond, wake up.

What?

Where's mom?

She didn't come home last

night?

Raymond, we're not supposed

to go out.

I'm just checking.

Her car's not outside.

How do you know?

I looked out the window.

What if she was in a car crash

or something?

Raymond.

Maybe she slept where she had

the conference.

Let's just eat and get ready for

school.

But there's no food left.

Then let's just get ready for

school.

Two firefighters were

seriously injured early this

morning when the floor

collapsed in a burning building

in Methuen.

Neighbors spotted the fire in

the abandoned...

Let's just watch something

else.

I want to see if something

happened to mom, like a car

crash.

Raymond, school just ended!

Raymond!

[ Coins rattling ]

What are you doing, Raymond?

We're not supposed to go out.

It's really close.

Why didn't mom say she wasn't

coming home last night?

Can we get pizza?

We should get ramen.

I'm sick of ramen.

We'll see how much it is for

pizza, okay?

See how much it is for

pepperoni.

It's too expensive.

They have kids' meals,

Raymond.

It's still too expensive.

Wait here.

[ Coins dropping ]

[ Telephone dialing ]

[ Ringing ]

The voice mailbox you have

requested...

Elaine Cheng.

is currently full.

Please try again later.

It's cheaper here.

It's okay.

I'll eat when we get back home.

What's wrong?

What if mom comes home while

we're out?

Then she'll be home when we

get back.

Can we walk by our old house

on the way back home?

It's kind of far.

Please?

Do you remember how to go?

It was...

Left, right, left, I think.

I hate our new house.

It's fine.

It's small, so it's easy to keep

clean.

But we can't do anything to

it.

What do you mean, "do

anything to it"?

I can't put, like, my

drawings and stuff on the walls.

Is this it?

Of course it is.

Don't you remember?

It looks different.

This is definitely ours.

It has a crooked driveway.

See?

Oh.

Skirtsy's gone.

Raymond, look!

Look, it says "sold."

Why did mom sell the house?

'Cause it was too expensive.

But I like our old house.

Mom couldn't pay for it,

okay?

It costs a lot to buy a house.

You'll understand when you get

older.

How much?

What?

How much does it cost to buy

a house?

It's really expensive.

Like $100?

No. More like $1 million.

Hmm.

We'll never get that much.

[ Insects chirping ]

Did mom say anything before she

left?

Listen, mom may not come back

for a while, so we have to take

care of ourselves now.

Grandma gave us some money.

We have to go into Boston to get

it.

I don't want to go to Boston.

I want to stay here and wait for

mom.

We don't have any money.

We should call dad.

He can come pick us up.

I think you'll want to go

into Boston when I tell you how

much money there is.

$1 million?

And what can we buy with

$1 million?

Our house!

When mom comes back, we'll be

living in our house.

It'll be a surprise.

You always say that dress

itches.

Mm-mnh.

Get your jacket.

Just in case she comes back.

Raymond, we're getting farther

away.

[ Sighs ]

No smoking, please.

That took so long, Raymond.

Because we went the wrong

way.

It's not near here.

I know where it is once we're

in Chinatown.

Raymond.

What is it?

I'm hungry.

We've only been walking for

like a minute.

We didn't have breakfast.

I can't help it.

[ Sighs ]

We can get some food after we

get the money from the bank,

okay?

Fine.

Come on.

[ Telephone ringing ]

[ Ringing continues ]

[ Telephone ringing ]

[ Ringing ]

[ Sighs ]

Can I try again later?

You'll be out of here in a

few hours.

You said that yesterday

night.

It's almost been a whole day

now.

Just calm down, Ms. Cheng.

I shouldn't even be here.

I didn't do anything.

[ Door slams ]

[ Scoffs ]

[ Sighs ]

Raymond, do you know what

time it is?

It's getting dark.

Raymond, watch out!

Don't pull on my sleeve.

Just help me find the bank.

Isn't that the bank?

It's just a sign.

God.

Uh, hi, um...

Do you know where the

Storrow bank is?

The what?

The Storrow?

No. Sorry.

Excuse me, do you know where

the Storrow bank is?

Gonna notice you now.

Remember what mom said?

Only talk to women or people who

have kids.

Uh, excuse me, um, do you know

where the Storrow bank is?

Oh, uh...

Oh, uh, it's straight up this

street and then make a right on

Essex.

Come on.

Hey, look... Essex!

Raymond, it's closed.

Let's go home now.

We have to walk around until

it opens in the morning.

I don't want to be in Boston

anymore.

Do you want $1 million or

not?

I do, but I don't want to be

in Boston anymore.

[ Horn blares ]

Raymond?

What?

If we had $1 million, why did

we sell the house?

Because mom put it there for

an emergency, and now it's an

emergency.

You said grandma put it in

there.

Yeah, grandma put it there.

Was it mom or grandma?

What?

You don't believe me?

We should have stayed at

home.

We don't have a choice.

Mom's gone.

She's not gone!

Stop saying that!

She is gone.

I don't believe you that

there's $1 million, and I don't

believe you that mom's gone!

Shut up.

You don't know anything.

Give me some money.

I don't have any money.

I'm gonna call dad.

Stop saying you're going to

call dad.

He can drive down from

Providence and come pick us up.

He can't.

We're on our own.

He can.

You just don't want him to.

Dad lives in Hong Kong.

He just told you he lives in

Providence so you won't get

upset.

That's why we have to go to

great-grandpa's house to call,

and that's why we won't see him

until he comes back to the

U.S.

But he's going to come back

for my birthday.

That's because he has a

conference here.

Mom left just like dad left, and

now we have to take care of

ourselves.

[ Crying ] Dad does live in

Providence.

Fine, then. Get out of here.

Tina?

[ Sighs ]

Tina!

[ Sighs ]

You shouldn't have walked away.

Grandma only gave us $500.

That's a lot.

No, it's not, Tina.

It's not enough for later.

We're gonna build and sell some

of our inventions.

I did all the math last night.

We're gonna use $2 to buy the

supplies for the spaghetti

spinners.

We'll make 1,000 of them and

sell them for $10.

Then we'll have $10,000.

Then we'll make 20,000 spinners

and sell them for $10.

Then we'll have $200,000.

Do it once more, and how much do

we get?

$1 million.

Wow.

But we're gonna have to go to

the bank tomorrow and get that

money, okay?

Hi, I'm in downtown crossing,

and I want to get to Chinatown.

So, what are you gonna buy when

we have $1 million?

A house?

But after.

Pizza, frozen pizza,

gummi bears, "grease 2" on tape,

and a couch, like Skirtsy.

You can't draw on this one,

though.

I didn't mean to.

Raymond, how are we gonna sell

so many inventions?

We'll have some kids sell

them to their friends.

And we have to stop going to

school, because we have to work.

I don't want to stop going to

school.

We have to wait.

I don't want to wait.

Tina, this is important.

[ Sighs ]

[ Siren wails in distance ]

[ Sighs ]

Raymond, I'm scared.

[ Buzzer sounding ]

Why don't we see grandma?

She doesn't live here.

She lives in Somerville.

[ Buzzer continues ]

[ Door buzzes ]

Come on.

Raymond, where's Somerville?

I don't know. It's far.

Don't lean there.

The walls are dirty.

Sunday already?

You're Elaine.

You're Tina.

I'm Raymond.

I'm Tina.

You're Raymond.

You're Tina.

I have lived here for

12 years.

Then you should know the

rules in this country.

You let Nancy and Rosemary

go.

They're both naturalized.

You, on the other hand, aren't.

We got a lot of data, but

we're having trouble sorting it

all out... where the money goes,

how it's collected.

I already told you.

I don't know anything else.

Then we have no choice but to

report you to immigration.

Elaine, you're involved in an

illegal pyramid scheme, one that

targets immigrants and

low-income families.

Find Betty Cardellini.

She will tell you everything.

You cannot keep me here forever.

You're a Hong Kong national

working in the U.S. with an

expired visa.

We can hold you here as long as

we want.

You... you're supposed to

give me a lawyer now.

That was when we were in

Atlanta.

Remember?

I washed, and you stood next to

me on a little stool.

You said, "papa, I can help."

Then, when you had Charles,

he stood on the same stool.

It was good when Charles went to

college.

So many people at the

graduation...

Took their hats... whee!

Whee! Whee!

[ Laughs ]

You're Charles.

No, I'm Raymond.

Good boy, Raymond.

Hey, Tina, Tina.

Wake up. Tina.

Tina.

[ Moans ]

Shouldn't we say bye to

great-grandpa?

We'll see him on Sunday,

okay?

[ Beeping ]

[ Whirring ]

[ Beeping ]

[ Whirring ]

[ Beeping ]

My card didn't work.

I see the problem.

The amount in the account was

too much to be accessed through

the ATM.

How much is in the account?

$1 million.

[ Man speaking Chinese on

[ radio ]

[ Beeping ]

[ Beeping ]

[ Blowing ]

[ Card inserts ]

[ Beeping ]

[ Whirring ]

Can we take the long way

home?

Why?

You know.

Okay.

The spaghetti-spinner one we're

gonna have to do first because

that's the easiest.

The tie one is gonna take a lot

of sewing.

We can make an extra tie for

mom.

Mom's a woman.

She doesn't wear ties.

Do you think dad's ever gonna

live with us again?

If he doesn't, his office can

be my room.

But then we won't be in the

same room anymore.

That's true.

Come on. Let's go.

[ Airplane engines roaring

[ overhead ]

We can still buy back our old

house, right?

$10 each invention!

$12 for double!

$15 for double.

Inventions!

Inventions!

Inventions?!

Do you want a spaghetti spinner?

If you love spaghetti, this

is the best thing for you.

Inventions!

Inventions!

Inventions for sale!

$10!

Inventions, $10!

If you like spaghetti, this

is for you.

Inventions for sale!

Inventions for sale!

Thank you.

Inventions for sale!

Inventions for sale!

Do you want a spaghetti spinner?

That was a really cute dance.

It's only $10.

I only have this, but you can

keep the change.

Wow!

Wow.

[ Thumping ]

Uh...

Hi.

Don't touch that!

That's mom's stuff!

[ Door closes ]

I'm at the address you gave

me, the one listed as the Cheng

residence on the gold rep files.

Can you call in to social

services?

I don't know anyone there,

either.

Okay, copy that.

[ Telephone rings ]

Hey, did you talk to the

woman from the FTC?

Yeah, two kids from Quincy?

Just give me one moment.

[ Keyboard clacking ]

Raymond and Tina?

I just need you to answer a

couple questions, and then we'll

figure out what to do next,

okay?

Does anybody want a juice box

before we start?

No?

Okay.

So...

Do your mom and dad leave you

home alone often?

Our dad lives in Hong Kong.

Well, your mom, then, does

she?

We had to be home because we

were working.

Does mom make you work for

her a lot?

We weren't working for her.

What line of work are you two

in?

Sales.

Inventions.

Tina!

It's okay.

Go ahead.

Wow.

[ Chuckles ]

What does it do?

Oh.

[ Muffled ] ...Found out

about that.

She spent two days and never

told us a single thing about it.

Well, I don't know that she

knows...

[ Door beeps ]

What did they say?

They didn't say anything.

They listened.

In fact, they don't have enough

to charge you with anything.

They were trying to scare you

into giving up any information

you had.

And your work visa is expired,

but since your two children are

American citizens, that should

be fine.

They may ask you to give another

statement when they charge the

Cardellinis.

So...

That's all?

I can go?

I don't know.

Is that all?

[ Door beeps ]

We have a system in this country

for a reason.

It's there to protect you and to

protect your family.

You should've told them your

kids were back at the house.

They would have gone and gotten

them.

Jesus Christ.

It's for spaghetti.

Oh, it's just as good, right?

How much you selling these

things for?

$10.

$10?!

$5.

Well, in that case...

Excuse me. Sorry.

Uh, John McCarthy to see

Daniel Krause.

This way.

Mommy!

Hey.

Hey. Come on.

Mommy.

Are you okay, Raymond?

Aren't you glad to see mommy?

This doesn't look good.

Um, I filed a report, but unless

this happens again, you'll

probably be fine.

It's a three-strikes policy.

You good?

Yeah.

Unlock the door, mom.

Raymond, Tina, what are you

doing in here?

What is all this?

It's from the drugstore.

But where did you get the

money?

Raymond, where did you get the

money to buy all this?

I took the money that grandma

gave us.

You went into Boston?!

To the bank?!

What if you had gotten hurt?!

What if something had happened

to your sister?!

We're fine, mom.

We're always fine without you.

It's not fine, Raymond.

It's not fine.

[ Crying ]

Don't be sad, mom.

Raymond and I were gonna sell

inventions so we could buy back

our old house.

[ Sniffles ]

But I don't really care that

much anymore.

We can just do what you want.

It's okay with me.

[ Continues crying ]

Don't be mad, mom.

I'm sorry.

I'm not mad.

I'm not mad.

[ Sniffles ]

Let's have family day tomorrow,

okay?

Mommy will make everything

better.

We can go to the mall.

We'll go wherever you want.

It's okay.

We can wait.

[ Crying ]
