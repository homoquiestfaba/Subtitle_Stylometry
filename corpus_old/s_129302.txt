La-la-la

La-la, la-la-la...

You ready?

Oh. Not going.

Not dressing up like an adult.

Yeah, but we're
game-day players.

Come on.

Let's go.

Okay.

l put on the clothes,
and l feel better for a second

like l'm somebody
with someplace to go

but then l think
l'm a complete fraud

and they'll see
right through me.

...La-la-la

La-la, la-la-la...

A fine fantasy object,
but useful, too--

shitting, sitting,
insulation in the winter months.

Sam...

...La-la-la

La-la, la-la-la...

Not an easy job market

but you're the most sought-after
graduates in history.

Know your value.

Sell to the highest bidder.

Now, we know your...

...market share
of existing markets.

Nothing else matters.

You can talk
about your art history

your Derrida,
your la-dee-dah, your poetry

but in reality,
the moment you step outside

the magic circle drawn
around this institution

you are at the mercy
of market forces

and nowhere will prepare you
more thoroughly to harness

those forces
for your own benefit

than McKinsey
and Company Consulting.

Remember, follow the bouncing
ball to McKinsey.

You got to get
over to l-banking.

You won't buy workout clothes
for ten years.

Somehow l don't see you working
in a bank.

Thanks.

l calculated the odds
of getting hired by McKinsey.

From Stanford or here,
it's about 500 to one.

From anywhere else,
forget about it.

Why do you tell me these things?

So...

how you doing?

l'm fine.

That could be the most dangerous
lie you tell today.

Come on, Bill.
l've been back for ten minutes.

Just put me to work.
l'll be okay.

l've got a Missing Persons.

Male, Caucasian, 24 years.

Name: Embry Larkin.

So, when'd this kid go missing?

Uh... two years ago,
from the university.

Rich kid.
Dropped out. No family.

Some um, lawyer-- a trustee--

says he hasn't touched
his accounts.

Now tell me he was
on drugs and depressed.

Well, there is a drug thing,
yeah.

Come on, Bill.

He drove up north

with a couple of rocks
in his pocket.

-He jumped in a lake.
-Hey, we're not looking

to hit any home runs here, okay?

The kid had money.

lt's going to get investigated
and you're the right guy today.

You going to give me a cruiser?

''Boa. B-O-A.''

My mother's been
to a snake church.

Did you say, ''snake church''?

Yeah, snake church.

Okay. ''Persian religious
teacher.'' Nine letters.

Zoroaster.

Great. Good and evil.

''My book is Genius''--
''Genius'' capitalized.

He's a physicist.
l should know this.

He had weird hair.

''Feynman. F-E...''

l can spell ''Feynman.''

''F-U-C. Feynman.''

l'm sorry.

My McKinsey interview is
in 30 minutes.

Personally, l'm not a dog
that salivates every time

some l-banker consultant
rings his little bell.

Hey, um, Katie, um

l love being friends
in quotation marks.

lt makes me so horny.

Knock it off. We are friends.

Hey, Katie.

Amanda. Sam. August.

So, um, we were just talking
about friendship and how...

How we'll all be selling out.

Sooner or later.

Some of us sooner than others.

l don't know, you guys.

l think it's just really about
doing what makes you happy.

He's right. Harrison,
you're just so... hopeful.

Oh, thanks.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

l already spoke
with two officers.

l'm not sure
what else l can tell you.

Right, right.

Well, those other two detectives
are no longer on this case.

l am.

So, what makes you think
Embry Larkin is dead?

Purely account activity.

We haven't heard from him
in a couple of years.

He hasn't used
any credit facilities.

But this kid was
all over the map.

l mean, how do we know
he's not sitting on some island

smoking Thai stick,
wearing a sheet?

He also had
two first-class airline tickets

to Athens, Greece,
that he never used.

lt takes seven years

for a missing person
to be declared dead.

Now's as good a time as any
to get the ball rolling.

Right.

Well, who gets the money?

The Larkin Foundation.

-All of it?
-All of it.

Look, his family was a client
of the original partners.

l don't know this kid at all.

Katie!

Hi, Katie Burke.

There is a message for you.

Your thesis advisor,
Professor Jergensen's office

they said l should find you,
so l did.

Here's the message.

lt says for you to come
to Jergensen's house.

That's scary.

How's your thesis coming,
anyway?

lt's almost done. How's yours?

Turned it in.

Ms. Burke, l'd like
to have you meet Wade Handler.

He's a police officer.

Hello.

Hi.

Mr. Handler has a line
of inquiries...

That's ''Detective,'' Professor.

''Doctor,'' Detective.

Detective Handler has a line
of inquiry

that he's forcing
upon the college.

Force?
Oh, no, we don't use force--

not in the People's Republic--
we ask politely

because the college is good
for the tax base

which is good
for the community

which is good for everybody.

So, um, Katherine Burke...

Katie.

Katie... l'm investigating
a young man

who was a student here,
Embry Larkin.

Something happen to him?

Well, that's
what l'm trying to find out.

What was your relationship?

He was my boyfriend.

Detective, this college is
very proactive

about the privacy
of its students.

Oh, l understand, Doctor.
l'll be gentle.

So... he was your boyfriend?

He disappeared.

He left school.

He disappeared,
or he left school?

Which?

Both, l think.

l... haven't heard from him.

Not once?

Not even once.

Do you have any idea

-where he might be?
-No.

That's fine.

Thank you for your time.

Here's my card.

lf you think of anything else,
just give me a call, all right?

How's your thesis coming?

l'm learning so much.

You have a draft for me?

Close, really close.

Let's preserve our older dorms.

Go home, leave it alone.

Let's preserve our older dorms.

Go home, leave it alone.

Let's preserve
our older dorms...

How'd it go?

l completely blew it.

There's tea and stale pastries.

Don't, whatever you do,
take one.

l got crumbs
all over my cashmere sweater.

l won't be wearing
a cashmere sweater.

So, l don't think
that'll be a problem.

Ooh, working-class hero,
good strategy.

They hated me.

l could tell.

They want Vietnamese orphans...
and engineers.

God, why wasn't I born
a Vietnamese orphan?

This is so familiar--

''l blew it. l'm a loser,'' and
then, ''Oh, look, l got an A.''

No.

l lost my concentration.

l wasn't supposed
to concentrate.

lt was supposed
to be effortless.

And then,
l started concentrating

and becoming earnest

and then l started seeing them
as seeing me as seeing myself

as the type of person who wants
to appear earnest

which is completely wro...

Do you hear what's going on
up here?

l hate wearing
these itchy things.

How do l look?

How do you think you look?

...Of unbounded domesticity

Though a doctor of divinity
is located in this vicinity

But they give up the felicity
of unbounded domesticity

Though a doctor of divinity

A doctor of divinity...

Headline: ''Composer
of Questionable Talent

''Excoriates Audience
For Enjoying His Music.

''ln a bizarre exercise
in self-loathing

''Senior Embry Larkin--

''winner of the Leonard Bernstein
Award for Original Composition--

''stood up before his
latest theatrical production

Trip-Hop Inferno

and lacerated the audience
for their attendance.''

He flipped off 200 people

and disappeared three weeks
before graduation.

He was already
Summa Cum Laude

and he says,
''Screw you and your degree.''

lt was exceedingly theatrical
and standard Embry.

What was standard about it?

Dropped out twice--

once to work on some
archeological dig in Cambodia...

once to work in a factory.

l expect him to pop up
running La Scala

or the Berlin Opera.

What a guy.

800 math S.A.T.s.

3.94 GPA.

Thesis?

''Emerging Ancillary Markets in
the Global Wireless Revolution.''

l bet that's quite a read.

We're actually looking
to beef up our Tech Practice

but then you probably
already knew that.

So...

''Katherine Burke...''

who are you?

Where do you come from?

l grew up
in the middle of nowhere.

The birthplace
of Wendell Willkie

is 20 miles away,
and that's about it.

My mom works in a bottling plant
and sells Nutra-Life products

and my dad left
when l was little.

l never really knew him.

Hmm.

Tell us about a problem
you've encountered.

My guidance counselor tried

to keep me from applying
to good schools.

l thought she was my friend.

She said she understood me

and that l would be happier
staying close to home--

junior college
or secretarial school.

She hated me.

What action did you take?

l invited a senator
who attended college here

to speak at our school.

And what was the result?

l got a strong letter
of recommendation

from a U.S. Senator,
was accepted early decision

and they gave me
lots of financial aid.

And what did you learn
from this experience?

Truthfully?

Of course.

Mrs. Castleman
was a sneaky bitch.

lt was the first time
l was betrayed

by someone l trusted.

l looked up to her.

l didn't come close

to understanding the depth
to which she resented me.

l learned that people
who help me, who invest in me

become my partners,
and my success is their success

that relationships
are symbiotic.

l learned responsibility
based on others' faith in me.

l hope to be able to pay some
dividends to those investors.

How many pennies
do you think it would take

to fill this room?

With or without us in it?

Whoa, whoa, stop!

Okay, that was... appalling.

Sopranos, this piece was written
by monks who believed in God.

They're singing
not to other monks

but to God.

They're singing
about God to God.

And you think
Im a tough audience.

Okay, l'd like to hear you

you, and...

you.

Step down here.

From the beginning.

And...

You and you.

And...

You.

Again.

Sing.

This is the spirit
dissolving in the music

carrying up to God...

Open up and let her rip.

Don't perform... create.

Say, ''Muse, l hate you,
but l hate you on my knees.''

Scream, ''l am the infantile
center of the goddamn universe!''

Everyone!

l am the infantile center
of the goddamn universe!

Now everyone!

Are you listening to this?

Water polo or lacrosse?

Lacrosse.

Word is, you slaughtered it.

l talked to Brian

whose brother dates
that cold fish, Susan.

Did you really call
some lady a bitch?

Slight exaggeration.

Yeah, they saw 60 people
and liked exactly two--

you and a North Korean girl
who speaks eight languages.

They said that?

Ms. Burke?

You sure work hard.

Listen, do you have time
for a cup of coffee?

No, l really don't.

Steam heat.

The best kind.

Doesn't dry you out up here.

You're not a big one
for small talk, are you?

l mean, l get it, believe me.

A person can really piss their
life away talking to idiots.

Do you think it's possible
this kid, Embry

might have killed himself?

Nobody with Embry's self-regard
would kill himself.

Nobody. He would have himself
bronzed first.

ln fact...

if you see a statue
of him somewhere

check and see
if there's a person inside.

He hurt you that badly, huh?

lt's none of your business.

Well, actually, it's my job,
so it is my business.

You know, l'd love
to just pal around

and talk about the past--
really, l would--

but l'm actually trying

to move on with my life
right now.

Right.

l'll see you around.

We need to be quiet...

in the library!

Quiet!

Studying...

Ah, 10:30 on a Friday night.

l wonder where Katie is?

l thought you were entertaining
the lacrosse team.

l was being entertained
by the lacrosse team.

The global wireless revolution
will be safe until tomorrow.

And the day after.
We're leaving.

Want a blender drink?

No, blender drinks suck.

Oh, look, it's a Siberian bear.

Who paid for all this?

What?

Who paid for all of this?

His dad was just appointed
Governor of Uttar Pradesh.

Evening, Mr. Bond.

To Russia.

What?

-To Russia.
-To Russia.

Yeah.

Match you.

-Again.
-Again.

Again.

-Again.
-Again.

Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

What makes a kettle whistle?

What makes gold precious?

Right now...

everything is so perfect.

l feel so connected.

We'll show you everything...

Why don't we feel
this way all the time?

Maybe l'll always wear a hat.

Hat guy.

The guy who wears the hat.

Beautiful day

lt's a beautiful day

lt's a beautiful day

lt's a beautiful day

lt's a beautiful day

lt's a beautiful day.

Are you all right?

No.

Look, Katie...

um... a cop stopped by my room.

He left a note.

He said he wanted
to ask questions about Embry.

He probably talked to you first
and, uh, you know

l was just hoping
it didn't upset you.

Harrison, my entire body feels
like rusting metal.

And l'm seeing things.

l think l might have
a chemical depression.

Come on.

You are not one of those people.

What people?

The problem people.

You know, ''Hey, look,
have you seen my new problem?

''Hey, guess what?

l got a shiny new problem.''

You're not like that.

You're amazing.

No, l'm not.

Okay, um, you know what?

This is what we should do first.

Let's get out of here.

There is a huge
anti-globalization rally.

We could camp out.

We could get arrested.

Just stand for something.

l'd like to go to sleep now...

and when l wake up,
l'll stand for something.

Katie, it's not a joke.

Yes, it is!

Harrison, it's a huge joke.

Anti-globalization?

You might as well stop oxygen
or the sun coming up.

You know what?

You're really tired.

Um... yeah.

You're very tired

and l am, uh... l'm going to go.

Um... you know

if you think about it, please

try not to forget
our plans this weekend.

Okay?

Let's talk about you...

about your yodeling.

Level with me.

You've never sung anything
before, have you?

l've sung...

in the shower, walking,
sort of under my breath.

Burt Bacharach.

Johnny Mathis.

l wanted to meet you.

Hey...

Uh-uh-uh...

You're a virgin.

Nobody this organized
ever had time for sex.

Okay, Katie from Rushville

if you have a voice, you sing.

Nobody ever said, ''lf you
had a voice, take finance.''

l've been working, baby

Till l'm down

Just want to get
next to you, boy

l've been searching, baby

For a way to tell you how

All of the time

You took it

All of the time...

What now?

Whoa. ls this a bad time, or...?

No. l'm sorry.

l thought you were
somebody else.

That's good for me,
not for them.

So, we're having a little event
at an NBA game

kind of a meet-and-greet.

lt's fun, you know

if you're into pretending
you're not under a microscope.

Do you like basketball, or...?

l don't know.

Oh. Uh...

Sure. l'll come.

l... Thank you.

lt's exciting.

That's... for you.

See you.

lnability or helplessness

can have serious
psychological ramifications.

Powerless people become
either hostile or passive.

Neither is desirable.

We need to feel
that we are heard

and that justice
has been attempted

when we feel we are
unfairly treated.

Negotiation for resolution
of disputes

when your actions
prevent another

from achieving their goal...

is apparently a conflict
of interest...

lf we were to define goals...

La-la-la

La-la la-la-la

Where is this?

lt's not a theater.

Embry was interested
in non-traditional space.

This is under the theater.

My final production--

MiddIebrow For Lowbrows--

''but look

''we're under the stage,
like hell, itself.

lsn't that brilliant?''

lt's derivative.

You people are derivative.

You haven't produced
a real artist in over a decade

and l would rather be dead
than mediocre.

So, one last announcement
before the show:

Screw this play

screw this place

and screw you people.

And then he vanished,
like a magic trick.

Where do you think he went?

Word is, he had a car waiting.

Probably went to the airport.

l guess l haven't been feeling
like myself lately...

whatever that means.

l mean, l don't...

l don't know
what ''myself'' feels like.

lt's subjective
and changes all the time.

Have you been feeling uneasy?

l'm having trouble
finishing my thesis.

Uh... l'm having
trouble sleeping

and when l do sleep,
l'm having these weird dreams.

Huh.

You're exhausted, yeah?

Emotionally

mentally

and physically?

Okay.

This should help you
with the anxiety, all right?

And l'd like to schedule
a regular time for us...

at least until exams are over.

Okay?

l just keep thinking

that the finish line is
right there

and if l can just get across it
then everything will be okay.

We'll get you across.

So, l'm going to see him now,
l guess, on a regular basis.

You just want to do him.
l know you.

You know you.

He is cute.

Mm, sort of.
He's not my type.

Smart, sensitive,
wants only to talk about you--

how is that not your type?

Sam, l can't read,
l can't sleep...

And l'm sure Dr. Dave will be
able to give you what you need.

l'm serious.

Okay, okay,
did he sit behind his desk

or did he pull his chair
close to you?

Close to me.

Did he... lean over like this?

Did he look into your eyes
like this?

You're going to do him.

Sam...

Come on, how long has it been,
sophomore year?

What if it's rusty... or broken?

l still feel like
l'm betraying him.

Embry? Please.

What if Embry comes back?

He'd... wreck your life
just like before.

Listen, l want
to tell you something.

Um, l believe your friend,
Embry, is dead.

He had two airline tickets
for Athens, Greece.

Never used.
No credit activity.

He didn't... he didn't believe
in credit.

No cash withdrawals.
No ATM.

Was that other ticket for you?

Were you going to Athens?

Originally, but we were
both having second thoughts.

Well, l saw the beginning
of that show--

his speech to the audience.

Look, that was
just Embry being Embry.

He was going for shock value.

He was leaving;
l was a sophomore.

l mean, l thought
that he would call from Europe

and maybe l would meet up
with him in the summer.

l never heard from him.

You have unusually kind eyes.

See you around, Detective.

l'm Wade Handler.

l'm a cop.

You don't have to share
if you don't want to.

l don't even know what to say.

Uh...

l'd find tollbooth tickets
and credit card receipts

for bars in towns
l didn't think l'd been to.

One day l went out to my car

and there's a dent in the front.

l look closer.

There's blood
and some brown hair.

l still don't know
what happened.

Maybe it was a cat.

There was an incident
two years ago

involving an undergraduate
student and illegal drugs.

Right. What do you want to know
about Embry Larkin?

Well, he got himself arrested.

l want to know
what he was selling.

Was it heroin?

Heroin? Embry?

Are you kidding?

l'm not kidding.

No, no, he wasn't
into that shit.

They put him on Ritalin
when he was three

you know, your standard
A.D.D. misdiagnosis.

Okay, um...

Basically, he was
taking Wellbutrin

which is sort of like having
a perfect cup of coffee.

You know, it was great for work,
great for repetitive tasks.

Add in some Paxil

which is anti-depression,
anti-anxiety--

you know, that general sense
of well-being.

Was he selling it?

Look, Embry's dad was rich
and Embry's mom was rich

and they died
when he was three or four

making him doubly rich,
so... no.

So, what'd it do?

Made him normal,
you know, when he took it.

La-la-la

La-la-la, la-la-la...

Katie...

l heard my name whispered...

''Katie. Katie.''

There was somebody on the
other side of the row of books.

l think it was my old boyfriend.

l think he's back.

l'm almost certain l saw him
in his car.

l think he's been watching me.

And how does that make you feel?

Nervous...

elated...

scared.

l want to see him, but...

but scared
that l want to see him.

Why do you say scared?

Because l lost a part
of myself with him.

l just dissolved.

He was like a drug.

And he was locked
inside the library with you?

l think so, yes.

But you hadn't seen him
in two years?

l know how this sounds.

Katie, you fell asleep
in an old library

which is terrifying under
the best of circumstances.

You're facing your graduation,
the completion of your thesis

job interviews...
life-changing transitions.

You need to make allowances

for the emotions
that this will bring up.

Yeah?

He convinced her
she could be an artist.

They were going to live
in a houseboat in Amsterdam...

a sailboat off the coast
of Sardinia.

He'd compose, she'd sing
and tell him he was a genius.

Please, l'll have a double order
of escape fantasy

and a side of running away.

He was losing interest?

l saw it coming.

He'd replaced her in his show.

That bastard hurt her.

You know, she hasn't
dated anyone in two years.

Was he a jealous guy?

He didn't like her friends,
particularly the guy friends--

particularly, one friend--
this guy, Harrison Hobart.

He felt threatened by me.

Katie and l are close,
and one day he was being

a bit of a bully psychologically
and l said something.

He turned on me.

He just started poking me
in the chest

with his... with his finger

until, finally,
l stopped backing up.

You know, l didn't realize
he had a bottle in his hand.

He put you in the hospital.

Yeah, well,
it was only overnight.

Why didn't you press charges?

lf you had pressed charges

Katie might've held it
against you?

Yeah, probably.

You see

Embry didn't want to admit it

but Katie and l had
much more in common

than the two of them did...

and he apologized, so...

What is your relationship
with Katie?

Oh, man, l wish l knew.

You dating her?

l don't know.

Well, sort of.

Well, either you are
or you're not... right?

ls this about Embry
or is this about Katie?

l remember my dad leaving.

Almost my first memory.

He said, ''l love you.

You can't come with me.''

My mom turned the heat down
to 55 to save money.

l just remember this...

feeling of... emptiness...

...always being cold.

Sam...

-Hey.
-Hey.

l hope l'm not
interrupting anything.

Oh, well...

big night.

l saw Embry.

l think he's back
and l think he's watching me.

Where did you see him?

l saw him outside of class.

l saw him get into his car.

You want to...
you want to sit down?

You're kind of making me
nervous.

Are you afraid of him?

ls that why you're here?

l'm just afraid.

Okay.

l'll look into it.

Thanks.

You know, l'm not
really doing anything.

You're welcome
to hang out if you want.

Okay.

Okay.

So... why did you become a cop?

Oh, l don't know.

l, um... l had some issues.

l was screwing up.

My uncle had a badge
and he cut me a break.

What kind of issues?

Extreme...

extreme substance abuse.

Being a cop help?

Oh, no.

Uh-uh.

What do you mean?

Well, l got a pocketful
of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards

and l never changed anything.

Then l used up all the cards.

Setting the foundation.

Recreational logging.

Squirrel.

Who took all these?

Self-timer.

Ex-fiancee.

She got tired
of The Handler Show.

Yeah, when things
start going too good

l can't help myself,
l got to mess 'em up.

lt's my M.O., anyway.

Finished product.

Excuse me.

Can you take me home now,
please?

Katie?

You scared me.

Harrison, l'm...
l completely forgot.

l'm sorry.

You lied.

You lied to me.

l'm a... l'm a total idiot.

l'm just... l'm completely
deluding myself!

No, you're not an idiot!

You're not an idiot.

Katie,
l got to tell you something

and l should've told you
a long time ago.

l think...

you're kind...

beautiful... and talented

and l... l love you.

What?

Uh... l'm in love with you.

l think l've always
been in love with you.

Harrison...

But, you know,
you don't have to say anything.

You're great...

and... you're kind and organized

and one of the smartest
people l know

and anyone would be so lucky
to be with you.

Harrison... Harrison...

l go away for a while
and look what happens.

You let the whole place
fall apart.

The police are looking for you.

l don't really want to talk
to the police right now.

You've been messing
with me for two weeks.

More like three.

You're proud of yourself?

You think this is fun?

Katie, look...

This... this isn't
going to work.

What happened to you?

Where have you been?

l went traveling--

lndia... Asia.

l lived and worked.

l made my own money.

l had to see
what was out there

to know the value
of what is here...

the value of this.

Do you know
what my big goal has been?

lt's been to stop thinking...

to not think

to not think that every time
the phone rang it was you!

To not think that
every piece of mail

in my mailbox was from you!

To not think

that every person
l'd see approaching was you.

l thought about you
every bit as much

as you thought about me.

l don't believe you.

Katie l was afraid
to say this before.

l love you.

Katie.

Hi, Katie Burke.

Do you know anything

about somebody being
in the tunnel?

Because the door was open
and it's not supposed to be open

and it's to remain closed
at all times

unless you're maintenance

and you haven't been around
to ask about it

and l'm supposed to ask.

No, l don't. l'm busy.

That's not very nice.

Should l tell you what l know?

l was going to, but now maybe
l've changed my mind.

What are you talking about?

Harrison Hobart is missing.

That's two, isn't it?

Embry is definitely back.

l know l should've told you
right away

but l'm overdue on my thesis

which is essentially one long
string of endless numbers

and finals are coming up

and Embry has always had

a sort of... chemical aversion
to Harry Hobart

and l don't... l don't know
if he would do anything.

l mean, he might, but this...
this whole experience is

so far out of my normal range
of things.

Okay, slow down.

Are you saying that Embry

might have done something
to Harrison?

l don't know.

l'm not sure.

l don't know why l feel
so comfortable with you.

l know that l shouldn't.

God, what am l doing here?

lt's okay.

No, it's not.

Get down on it,
get down on it

Get down on it,
get down on it...

lf somebody told me
this was the rest of my life

l think l'd kill myself
right now.

This isn't the rest
of your life.

This is right now.

Yeah, well, right now

my friends are
out somewhere else

and they're having a great time.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Your old friends.

Yeah.

l'm just blowing off steam.

l'm sorry, all right?

So what's up
with the Larkin kid, huh?

Apparently he had
a car waiting-- a CTS Limo.

lt was supposed to take him
to the airport.

He never got in.

Never used the airline tickets.

The girlfriend says he's back.

What's this girl like, Wade?

What do you mean?

ls she a nice girl?

Yeah.

Smart?

What do you think? Yeah.

What about you, Wade?

Are you smart?

Harrison is
a responsible young man

and we know he holds you
in high regard.

He thinks of you
as a confidante.

This is so unlike him.

We're obviously very worried.

lf there's anything at all
you could tell us...

l don't know where Harrison is.

l'm as worried as you are.

This is difficult for me to ask

and in no way
am l impugning you.

Was Harrison using drugs?

What?

He missed his father's birthday.

Can you think of anyone
he might have gone to visit...

any new friends...
people we don't know about?

Uh, Harrison doesn't even
drink coffee.

He worries about damaging
the instrument.

We're grasping for anything.

l'm sure that there is...
some explanation.

What do you think you're doing?

Finding you.

Do you know where Harrison is?

The tree-hugger?

l don't really keep tabs on him.

Have you seen him lately?

Wouldn't you like to know.

You piss me off
like nobody else, you know that?

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

What you going to do about it?

l want you to come away with me
to the country house.

Where is Harrison?

l'll tell you
at the country house.

Sure he was in love with her.

Harrison's a good guy.

He mooned around,
but he was sweet.

He got his name
on scientific papers

when he was about 12.

So, what did he know
about anything?

Do you think it was odd
that he still liked a girl

who hadn't shown him any real
interest in over two years?

l thought it was
the opposite of odd.

Guys are drawn to her
like bugs around a bug lamp.

For four years, l've had
the privilege of watching it.

That bother you, Julie?

Think you see the horns
of jealousy?

You got my angle?

You might want to ask yourself
why you're so interested in her.

They think it's
a coltish vulnerability

but it's just self-obsession.

The pea brain says,
''She needs saving''

and the pea brain says,
''l can save her''

and then she doesn't
notice them.

So, they go crazy.

lt's about the missing dad
and... validation.

She just needs a friend.

Embry.

Embry!

Detective.

What are you doing here?

Oh, right.

Stalking Katie, l remember.

Listen, l'm...
l'm looking for her.

l think this kid,
Embry Larkin, is back.

Who told you that?

She told you that Embry's back?

She's seen him?

Do you think she's
with him right now?

l know. l'll keep
asking you questions

and you keep
not answering them.

Look, l'm just concerned
about her.

Detective, you seem like
a pretty good guy--

you do, you do--

but Embry was the
love of her life.

Ouch!

He who snatched the maidenhead
from the maiden.

l shouldn't have said that.

Do you want to come upstairs
and have a drink?

Bad Samantha! Bad Sam!

l better go now.

You fell asleep.

lt's been a long time
since l've watched you sleep.

Where were we?

Oh, no.

-What did you do to Harrison?
-What did you do to Harrison?

What did you do to him?

Evisceration.

Vivisection.

Drawn and quartered.

The quartering act.
Dismemberment.

And set him on fire.

You arrogant, preening... bore!

Who are you running back to,
Katie?

Not the tree-hugger.

Not the townie cop.

You're already
the young professional--

passionless, desiccated....

smug.

He slipped that under my door
a couple of nights ago.

Where's the old place?

Suite 408.

l'm sorry.

l should have told you sooner.

Can l keep this?

And l saw him again.

l went to his country house.

l told him l never wanted
to see him again.

Well, l want to see him.

l need to see this guy.

Detective, please do me a favor.

Sure.

l'm done.

Everyone's done.

l'm not done.

Detective!

You should arrest that man.

lt's medicinal-- glaucoma.

l've got a prescription.

Just don't play
any Grateful Dead

or you're all going in.

Okay, we'll try not to.

Hey, Jed, what do you say?

Hey, long time, no see, Handler.

Listen, if you're not too busy
dipping into the drug seizures

you want to take a look at these
for me?

Do a little compare and contrast
of the handwriting.

''My summer vacation.

Working for the
Supreme Court Justice.''

l bet he got in.

Thanks, Jed.

Hey, Handler, are you happy?

You seem happy.

Last Chance Dance?

Yeah, that's where they
call the wonks

out of their cubbyholes
and try to mate them.

That would be you.

Wonks?
l'm a scientist. Pure science.

lt's sexy.

Very sexy.

Yeah, you want to go?

Did she just ask me out?

l believe so.

l'll go.

Katie! Oh, my God.

Look what came!

You got the job!

l didn't look at this at all.

There's a card in it.

$10,000?

For what,
shipping all of your antiques?

Airline tickets?

Bob?

Oh, come on.

Don't be one of those
annoying people who wins

then acts like winning
doesn't matter.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

You know, you could've told me
that Embry was back.

l know.

You're thinking about the cop,
aren't you?

Maybe.

Okay, visualize this with me.

You're down in New York

consulting with Lou Gerstner
or the head of GE

telling them how to buy
South American countries

but on the weekends
you fly back up here

to hang out with the cop,
do cop things

maybe go to cop mixers.

l like the cop.

Yeah, um, l can see that.

How much money
do detectives make?

Didn't your mother tell you
that's a rude question to ask?

No. She was always
asking people that.

lf l guess right,
do l get a prize?

Maybe.

A million bucks.

l didn't want to insult you.

You're not going to insult me.

Look, you don't do police work
for the money.

What do you do it for?

l don't know really.

Most people do it because
that's what their fathers' did.

ls that what your father did?

He was a teacher.

Hey. Hey...

Oh... l guess l was dreaming.

l was... just having a dream.

What are you thinking about?

That l just woke up

next to a girl
that l don't really know

and l'm not hungover.

How does that feel?

Like free-falling through space.

Can l tell you something
and you won't get mad?

You don't seem like a cop to me.

You don't seem
that happy doing it.

Can l tell you something?

l'm thinking about quitting.

What would you do?

l'd probably go up to my cabin
and hammer some nails

figure out the meaning of life.

Okay, l'll come.

l didn't ask you yet.

Sure, you did.

l feel like an anvil has been
removed from my ankle.

Finishing your thesis?

Finishing my thesis,
school, everything.

That's a good thing.

You know, um... l know you're
moving down to New York

after graduation, and...

the transition
from school can be tough.

So l want you to know
you can always call me, okay?

'Cause l'm down there a lot,
and...

l mean, l was actually wondering
if maybe, um...

...if l could call you.

l was nervous about telling you
that l'm feeling better

and that l won't be needing
to see you anymore.

Thank you for making it easier.

Hey, Handler.

Hey, Jed.

You really off the job?

l really am.

You probably don't care
but the samples were a match.

The same person wrote the flyer
and the college application.

Well, that's just aces, Jed.

You keep up the good work.

See you around.

Only thing is... ink tests show

that the note was written
two years ago, not last week.

You people are derivative.

You're not viewing
a representation of hell.

You are hell.

You haven't produced
a real artist in over a decade.

...Screw this play...

and screw you people.

Uh... the last time l checked,
a weekend lasted two days.

Am l wrong?

Did we switch
to a French workweek

while l wasn't looking?

Oh, look who's jealous.

ls there electricity

or will you be using the light
from the fireplace?

l don't mean to pry

but when do they want you
to show up at McKinsey?

l'm not sure.

Absolutely not.

What do you mean
you're not sure?

l mean l don't know.

l haven't heard.

Okay, uh, listen.

Don't flip out but l'm thinking
of deferring it for a year.

What?

lt's only a year.

l'm burned out.
l'm tired.

What's this cop done to you?

He hasn't done anything.

Well...
maybe a little something.

He doesn't even know
this is what l'm thinking.

l think go with him.

So what if it takes up
a year of your life?

l mean, God, everybody thinks

that everything has
to be so planned out

you know, like our life is
on a rail

and one misstep,
it all goes away.

Basically...

who knows?

The last time you were this
irrational was with Embry.

Maybe that was the last time
l was happy.

Well, so l just said,
''The hell with it.''

Then l went
and climbed a mountain

but l didn't bring enough water.

So l got
a little disorientated

and the state police had to come
and pick me up.

lt was really more embarrassing
than anything else.

Oh, um...

Whatever happened
with that cop, right?

'Cause he was
kind of sweet on you, or...?

Um... l don't know.

l think he's in New Hampshire.

Oh.

Well, New Hampshire's nice
this time of year.

l've changed my mind,
l've changed my mind

Yeah,
l've changed my mind, oh...

Come on... come on.

lt doesn't like
to move the large numbers.

Did you ever think you'd be up
this late

restructuring a media company?

l thought l was going
to be a rock star.

l won't make stupid threats

but you're not going
to run away with this guy

because wherever you go,
l can follow you...

even if it's to the woods
in New Hampshire.

Why don't you yell?

Come on, l dare you.

Hey, hey, are you okay?

What's the matter?

Let's just leave.

What happened?

He was here.

Who? Embry?

Well, where is he?

Where'd he go?

l'll take care
of this right now.

No, don't.
That's what he wants.

He'll hurt you.

Just wait here.

Why don't you join us?

You're going to be great.

You shouldn't be in here.

l'm coming with you.

Well, where do you think he is?

He's right there.

Hey.

Embry, stop!

l want to talk to you!

Hey, Embry?

Hey, Embry?

Come on out.

l'm a police officer.

l've got a gun.

l don't want to hurt you.

Embry?

Hey.

l heard what you said up there.

lt was amazing.

lt was
an incredible performance.

l wasn't... acting.

But we're... leaving together.

Stick with finance, Katie.

lt's what you're good at.

Embry!

Embry!

Embry, wait!

We're leaving together.

You think l'd take you
to Europe?

You'd just stand around
awkwardly

and l'd feel sorry for you.

l love you!

Really?

We made love right over there.

And now l can't get away
from you fast enough.

Embry!

Look at you.

You have no grace.

What are you doing?!

Crazy bitch.

You can't come with me.

Embry, why are you doing this?!

Look at me!

Embry!

Katie!

There's no one there.

There's no one.

No one.

We're not going away together,
are we?

We're not going to New Hampshire
together, are we?

We'll get you help, okay?

-No. Listen.
-l want to come.

l want to go with you.

You'll be okay.

l want to go with you.

Katie, you can't come with me.

Look.

That's pretty.

There's snow on the roofs.

Katie, listen.

l'm this close
to making partner.

We both know the rules
about interoffice romance.

l wish we could keep seeing
each other

but it's just not worth
the risk.

l hope we can still be friends.
