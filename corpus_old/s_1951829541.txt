Leaves in the forest.

Going into the lake? 

Yes.

All kits, boys. 
He Ernie, how are you? 

What are you doing? 
-- We are waiting for the girls. 

Why is that? 
Afterwards they take their shower. 

Let them watch you? 
-- Sorry, it is a bit behind. 

There is a hole in the douchescherm 
So you can see. 

You can see them and they know not? 
-- Yes.

It is time that we go out of our clothes, 
In the water and go swimming. What do you think? 

He hated me always. 

Oh, no. 
-- My God. 

Are you still with that rope? 
-- What? 

You missed the whole pond. 
You flew over there. 

This was entirely your fault. 
You pushed me too hard. 

Then I had to jump you. 

And then you are surprised 
That my father hates you. 

The truth will store everything. 
I knew it. I knew it. 

Now it. 
I knew he hated me. 

What? 
-- How can you hate an eight? 

That was because you always plaagde me. 
Can you take him bad? 

Do you think he hates me? 
-- Yes, but for a different reason. 

Come on girls. 
We are showering. 

That was not fair. 

Do you see anything interesting? 
-- No, we do not. I swear it. 

I saw nothing. I swear it. 
I wanted to try, but I could not. 

We saw the tits of Dannie. 
What a pair. 

Do you get away! 

Harlow! All kits? 
-- How does it. 

You know it. 

How is it going? 
-- Not bad. Not bad. 

And your father? 
-- Good. Very busy. 

This city is ready to make 
To the hand. 

You know. Incredibly. 
Another son. 

Exciting. But the mess. 
That really does not. 

In addition, I have something special 
For the idiots to be taken to graze. 

What idiots? 
-- Mietjes of Ernie and his friends. 

I knew Ernie was a mietje. 
Does he now even though friends? 

I believe it. 

What do you think is so special? 

We Cappy visits. 

Come on. You know that they 
Not cope. 

Ernie, Michael, Tommy thick. 
You know, maybe Louis. He ... 

He may just. 
-- Think you know? 

Yes. This is nonsense. 

We will see what they can 
If they Cappy's cabin. 

If they Cappy's cabin. 
You speak against me. 

It is Carmine here. 
You know that I know that she does not exist. 

I found the cabin. 
-- Found? 

I found the cabin. 
-- You have found nothing. 

I am here only. 
-- I know. 

Have you seen the girls? 
-- I saw them. 

What do you think? They look good. 
They want only what hanging. 

Are you afraid? You are afraid. 
-- I am afraid for nothing. 

It's just waste of time. 
More. 

What happens? Wait?

I am the rooster. 

Come tomorrow asked me wake him up, then go 
I am with you. But we must act quickly. 

I see you do. 
Okay. 

What form these hamburgers? 

What's that? 
A piece of mouse? 

I said raw not rot. 

Cappy was a zeekapitein. 
A long time ago. 

After a terrible accident he came to 
These forests for everyone away. 

Come on, Joe. 
-- We heard this story each year. 

Do yourself a favour and 
Make a new story. 

Now it's happened. 
Ga retrieve that bottle, idiot. 

Remember that you wait at Cappy. 
-- Yes, it will do. 

You know what did Cappy? 

Cappy formed a circle with dead deer 
Around the camp. 

Rottend, dirt, dirty 

I walked through the woods and I fell about it, 
Their heads, their heads were chopped off 

And hung in the trees. 
Their spine was separate from their body. 

I almost did it in my pants. 
I swear it. 

Even my father is not there. 
He bears his gun under the shower. 

That you do not, you idiot. 
-- This is so stupid. Come on, we go. 

Do you know where you are now? 

The camp stops to 
Cappy the backyard. 

We sit here all on the border. 
He notes its territory with death. 

He is chasing them, then felt they live. 
-- My God. That is repugnant. 

He is sick in his head. 
A dangerous fool. 

And now is that beer bottle 
On his property. 

He Tommy. 

Why will you not get friend. 

Oh no. Mikey That it does. 
He must get going. 

Nothing. 
Let Cappy the achievement. 

And now listen to those idiots 
Joe Harlow's kampvuurverhalen. 

Oh no. If your father knew this. 
-- Obligation to kiss me. 

Let everyone lifting his glass. 
-- Hopefully there will be something else this year. 

Actually, yes. It is new. 
Because this is our last year here. 

At the beginning of 
A new summer season. 

I would not deprive you of it. 

You guys are my family. 

I consider your children and mine. 

I see you women as mine. 
Hence those children. 

Since my Molly died are you the 
Most important people in my 

And Tommy's life. 
I love you all. 

I will never forget you. 
On women and lovers. 

That they never meet each other. 

Will I see you tomorrow? 
Maybe, but I am going to walk. 

That is what I told. 
-- Go you boys again bullying? 

I have to arrange something with Joe. 
That's it. Vlug. Dom. 

Something? 
It does not agree. But ... 

Have you already chosen school?

You do not know where that is, right? 
It is in Athens Georgia.

-- That is far away.

They seem to have fun. 
They are just children ... 

Going my question 
Even answer? 

Pa, I was shocked me a monkey. 
-- Go home, young. 

Why? I did nothing wrong. 
-- What happens here on? 

Why guild you, Dannie? 
He drove me fits like a glove. 

They were on the cushion and 
I took them apart. 

You always dastardly deed. 
What are you looking for anyway. 

You are like a hesitant fate. 

Okay. Back to the bungalow. 
We speak each other later. 

Will I see you tomorrow? Then move on.

A small hike in the forest.

Where to go? Which way? 

Along here? 
-- Along here. Does not matter. 

What do you mean? 
If you play with us? 

Here it is. 

Where do we go? 

Where are we? 
-- I do not know. 

On the other side of the river. 

There is no path. 
How do we get back? 

What's that? 
-- A compass. 

Points to the north, east, 
South and the west. 

For if you lost. 

That does not help you, idiot. 
It is true, Joe. 

Where is the camp, Einstein? 

Sorry, in the other direction. 

See you next time for compass 
You leave so you teruggeraakt. 

It's creepy. 
-- So it is not on the other side.

Waking up. 

What do you think here? 

Who lives in that cabin? 

Cappy. 

What? 

Cappy. 

Beat, beat, beat. 

Where is he going? 

What was that? 

Someone pulled Joe inside. 
He stood before the window. 

There will be somebody. 

Let us do away with that. 
I am afraid. 

Buk you. 
My brother is there. 

Billie Jo, wake up. 
Do not sleep. Wake up. 

What did you do, boy? 
-- I do not know, Dad. 

Everything is good, Clemmy. 
Everything works out. 

Walking! 
Wegwezen! 

To where should we?

In my face.

We go. 

I am afraid. 
-- Obligation, Tommy. 

Maybe we need to rest. 
-- Yes, maybe he is right. 

To where do we? 
-- How should I know now? 

Perhaps old who wanted only waylay us. 
Maybe he does us nothing. 

He almost shot my head off. 
He almost killed Mikey. 

And you still think 
That he is not believed. 

Are you here. You will then see. 
-- Let him rest assured. 

Obligation! 
-- Boys. Joe is still there. 

I need to know where we are. 

Luke, that you make here.

We leave you no one decline. 

Five-minute breaks.

Ready? 

Jump from the road. 
Wegwezen. 

I have an idea.

I hear a truck. 

Take that away with you. Now. 
I follow you very much. 

Ga. Ga. 

Behind them. Vlug. 

They are escapes. 
-- Obligation. 

Yes. But they are in the vicinity. 
I can smell them. 

It's okay. 
Sta. 

Wait. I have an idea. 

If we work ignited 
See the whole camp us. 

And Cappy. 
-- I know. That must be true. 

Are you crazy? 
-- No. If Cappy comes out of his cab 

The cabin is empty. Yes? 
-- Okay. And then? 

There will still be a phone, 
A radio or something else? 

You are right. 
Then, we can also find Joe. 

We would have them 
Be able to slow down. 

I know how we doing? 
Come on. 

I am a bit worried 
On the boys. 

It is already late and 
They are not yet back. 

You have to be worried. 
-- They are right. They are long gone. 

This is work 

You know what you should do. 
You have only one chance. 

Notice that he flies straight up. 
-- Good. 

They send a signal. 

That can only open on the spot. 
Come we go. 

There is something wrong. 
-- That was great. 

This should anyone seen to be believed. 

Bend. 

I hear no ... 
-- Tommy. Obligation still.

Wegwezen.

There they are. 

Come boy. You should also help. 
These boys are smarter than I thought. 

How do you mean? 
-- They hunt now on us. 

Deputy Jefferson. 
How can I help you? 

I think that my sons 
And their friends at risk. 

Why? What danger? 
They are in the woods. 

She shot a vuurpijl. 
You have probably seen it. 

I want someone there. 
My husband and the other fathers 

, The boys search. 
-- I want you calms. 

The police should be here. 
We stay in the bungalows. 

Wait. 
Sandy, please do so even. 

How can I help. 
-- I would like to speak sheriff. 

It is urgent. 
I stay in the bungalows Mayfield. 

My sons and their friends 
In danger. They are in the woods. 

Find the sheriff and go to 
Mayfield bungalows. 

Why? 
-- There are children missing in the woods. 

Kalmeer. We are dealing with it. 
Begin at the beginning. I want all the details. 

This can only better be important. 
I think so. 

I am sheriff Demarco. 
What is the problem? 

Our children are in the woods. 
It is dark and late. We are worried. 

I want everyone calms. 

It is not because they are for a while 
Missing that they are at risk. 

You remain here. I go inside 
And will sign it. 

Caution. 
-- Success. 

You look out for Cappy. 
I stand here not to be murdered. 

That will not happen. 
You see the best of all of us. 

Do you really see that I do best? 
-- Yes, I think. 

Calm boys. 

Do it light. 

It stinks here. 
-- Look at the door. 

What's wrong with that light? 

Joe is not here. 
Where can he have left? 

I do not know. 

What's that stench? 
-- I do not know. 

I think we should leave. 
-- Learn. 

Look in the other room. 
-- Okay. 

They are urban children. 
-- They can not survive in the woods. 

Is Joe Harlow to them? 
-- Yes. And then? 

Then there is not a problem. 
He knows the region as his pocket. 

What's going on inside? 

A twin of five years, 
Sons of master Edwin Smith 

Be found alive behind 
A wreck of a car. 

Their mother, Margareth Smith was signed on 
Three yards from the car. 

She has not survived the accident. 

One child had severe brain damage. 
The other was found safe and sound. 

What? 
-- Come here. 

Is that blood? 
-- I do not know. 

What's happened here. 
-- I do not know. 

Boys. Cappy is there. He does. 
-- What? 

Everyone! 

We must find those children. 

You have to kill and leave 
For the buzzards and coyotes. 

Luke, you are along there. We follow it. 
-- Okay. I collect those bastards did. 

There is not yet a problem. 
-- Still no? What does that mean? 

To where do we? 
-- I do not know. 

As this. We have heard these shots. 
This we have heard. Geweerschoten. 

Come Lou. Almost you. 

I think my leg is broken. 

I bowl. 
-- No. 

Who said that their son had fireworks? 
-- My son Ernie. Why? 

Because that sounds like fireworks. 
Do you think not? 

I think so. 
-- How do you know the difference? 

I lost my whole life all around weapons. 
I know the difference now is. 

You could see a little more 
Meevoelend. 

You know that the geweerschoten. 
-- Do you think that I do not know. 

Call Freddy. Say that he is preparing. 
Say that we have a major problem. 

I am waiting here on my men. 
Okay? Come on. 

Is it? Is it? 

Goes with him? 
-- They did. 

Will someone water? 
-- I want to say something. 

Listen. Drink some water. 
-- What is, Ernie? 

Nothing. Let him rest assured. 

Where is Louis? 

Yes. Where is Louis? 

What happened? 

Louis is dead. 
Slain by Cappy's son. 

What are we going to do? 
-- I must vomiting. 

We never get this way. 
We will all die. 

I want to return to the bungalows ... 
-- Kalmeer! You must remain calm. 

So next we will survive. 
We remain calm and we kill them. 

Otherwise they kill us. 
Deaths? With what? 

Whatever it asks of us. 
Whether we are dead. 

We have to be here. 
It is not safe here. That you know. 

We must find a shelter. 
We need you. Okay? 

We are gone. Come on. 

Jefferson refers to a major problem. 
-- Apparently. 

What is the situation? 
-- There are six children missing. 

They are the bungalows here. 
I heard geweerschoten 

I want to know who is shooting 
And from where it comes. 

Good? 
-- Included.

-- Yes. 

Go you with Jefferson and a few men. 
Beginning in the north. 

Willie. You still with me. 
I take the west. 

What should I do? 
All roads and trails to explore. 

We meet on the north 
Of riverbed. 

I do not understand something. 

Why is it, what we do, where we 
Also, that they always find us. 

We must continue to move. 

If we inaction, we

You must help him. I have to help him. 
We must help them now. 

Come Tommy. 
We should do this. We go. 

Here. We go. 
Come on. I have you. 

Here is the riverbed. 

We have forests out operation. Nothing. 
-- They are crossing, Bubba. 

Take the men and several trucks. 
Search on the other side. 

Call and tell Freddy 
He met me at Cappy. 

I cross over here with Willie 
And go on foot until Cappy.

We cover us with it. 

Make sure it is fixed. 
-- Okay. 

Stick with the radio. 
Freddy. Come on. 

What's up, Cappy? 
-- Good evening, sheriff. 

What's with all that blood? 
-- I just caught a large beast. 

Were that the shots we heard? 
-- Yes. I had to shoot a few times. 

Come in if you look like. 

Could you not wait until tomorrow 
To see the documents in heels. 

It stinks as a hoerenkot. 

There are some missing children. 
They have the river crossing. 

Have you seen someone. 
-- I was out hunting. I have seen no one. 

Hunting? In the dark? 

I have the eyes of an eagle 
And the smell of a grizzly. 

I smell everything from a mile away. 
I have no light. 

Let me speak with your boys. 
Are they here? 

They are not here. 
I send them along tomorrow. 

That is not necessary. 

If I do not find children for tomorrow 
Jefferson to send me here tomorrow. 

For me okay. 

Klootzakken. We need those guys 
For the sheriff it does. 

Come boy. 
We go on hunting. 

They have him slain. 
They have poor Louis slain. 

Are those birds that sing to each other? 
-- No. They are. They give signals. 

How do you know that? 

Because birds at night not sing. 

And owls that? Those are also birds? 
-- Owls sing. They call. 

Thank God that he is not seen. 
-- Yes. 

What do you mean? 
-- I must urination. 

Plas then. 
I was shocked me a hat. 

Boys. 

Hey. Bardus bosbewoner. 
Here I am. 

Come on. Pak him. 
Attention to the leg. 

They duwden me. It is their fault. 

Are you okay. Do not worry. 
I get that a patch. 

Be careful with him. 
-- I have him. 

The bastard has me concerned. 
-- Let me see. 

Good. It seems to be good. 
Connect him. 

I can not oppose. 

Attention. 

To come along. 
-- I understand this is not. 

Wherever we go. They always find us. 
The north. It south. 

Did you hear him sniffing in the air? 
-- Yes. Why would that be? 

They smell your geurtje. 
As they find us. 

They can smell a mile away. 
They are boerenpummels. 

Do it off. Please. 
-- Why should I do that, vetzak. 

Listen. Please forgive me. 
The road. The road. 

The road ran to the cabin. 
Along that road, we can perhaps gone. 

But where is Cappy's cabin? 

I do not know. But if we 
Continue walking, we find they are. 

Okay. Along here. 

Goes with him? 
How does it. Please forgive me. 

Keep moving. Come on. 

From here we split. 
-- We are looking for all the whole night. 

We are tired. 
-- We want to rest. What should we do? 

I will say what we are going to do. 

Anyone who would like to, may continue. 
Because you are tired. 

But first get your new schedule. The 
Next six months, nights and weekends. 

How sounds that, Willie? 
-- Not good. 

That I thought too. 

It is morning. 
The boys are still missing. 

Nobody leaves before we 
They have found. Understand each other? 

Go to Cappy's. Speak with Luke and Clem. 
Ask those who have seen boys. 

What is happening? 
Sam says Billie Jo missing. 

Oh no. Not even one. 

What is the problem? 
-- It is my Billie Jo. 

She was not at home last night. 
I am really worried. 

Reverse. 

If we find nothing in the coming hours, 
I send one of my men. 

We go. We divide us. 
Some of Bubba. 

Freddy. Take you the rest. 
Okay? 

That is the truck. 

We have walked in circles. 
We should mark the trees. 

Do not worry. 
The road is somewhere in the vicinity. 

We need a radio in it. 
-- Let us have a look. 

Deputy Jefferson. Who is this? 
What's your name, boy. 

Where are you? 
-- In the woods. We need help. 

Help please. 
-- Carmine. There will be somebody. 

There will be somebody. 

Hello? Hello? 

He idiot! Here I am. 

You speak with the police. 
Answer, boy. 

Cappy is there. 

Can you hear me? 

He breathes not. 
I think he is dead. 

Where is Carmine? 

On the flight for that heikneuter 
With a scar. 

Poor. You are a bad boy. 
You showed me my brother hurt. 

Sta law. 

What happened? Is it? 
-- Are you okay? Wait. 

They did. We go. 

He comes back right. 

NO ACCESS 

I thought he was here. 
-- He was there. I swear it. 

I hit him on his head 
With a wrench. 

We must find him. 
We have to finish. 

We must find a way. 
What can we Cappy care. 

We must no longer continue. 

Cappy still alive. 

Do you really think he will stop when he notes 
What we have done with his children. 

We must find him 
Before he finds us. 

I have another plan. 

Are you here? 
It is deputy Jefferson. 

Here is a body. 
-- Luke. The son of Cappy. 

Willie. Give me a radio. 

Where are you? 

They need us anyway 
Already search meantime? 

We need to lure him in the fall. 

It is certainly true. He must think 
Us that he has to deal with 

This is perfect. An open plain. 

If we get him here 
He is ours. 

Let us do it. 

<i> If you can hear me </ i> 

Stay away from Cappy's cabin 
Until we are there. 

<i> We have a son 
Cappy dead </ i>. 

Kill those boys. Then the sheriff. 
Kill those boys. Then the sheriff. 

That's it. Find what sticks and 
Start digging. 

Make a pit. 

The arrow sticks by his mouth. 
He went through there. 

I wonder who has done this? 

I do not know. But if we 
Cappy, we find the boys. 

Get a cloth. 

My boys. 
My boys. 

How to get there? 
Of those boerenpummel. 

I am back immediately. 
Keep digging. 

Now there would be someone 
Still have to get something. 

I would like twigs and branches. 
We need to cover. 

I do it very much. 

Do not go too far that you are not lost. 

He is dead! 
Damn! He is dead! 

<i> Ladies, say goodbye to 
The yellow stone away. </ I> 

<i> I never saw so many trees. 
It is really fine. </ I> 

<i> Ga not too far that you are not lost. </ I> 

You know what, Cap? 

It's all over. 

It's all over. 

We need to figure out 
How we should go. 

We go back to there. Ga. 

Where are you! Show yourself! 

I killed your sons. 

I am waiting for you to open. 

Straight on, boys. 

You can not run away from me! 

You can not hide for me! 

I am the law! 

It is not yet over! 

Now it's over! 

What will you do now? 
Who made you so mad? 

Bring the children of the forest. 

Their parents are waiting for them. 
-- Okay. 

I see them. 

Ernie. There is Tommy. 
I see Carmine.

Thanks. 

Come here. Come on.
