YOKO [ON PHONE]: <i>What is wrong?</i>

I'm just leaving
the Williams' house now.

Jennifer's out
and Emma's asleep.

I'll leave the keys with Alex
at the care center

before I head to the airport.

<i>Did something happen?</i>
No, I...

<i>What is wrong?</i>
I need to go home.

I know I made
a longer commitment,

but I need to get back
to my family.

I can't explain it.
It's like something...

I just need to get back
to the States.

[BREAKING UP] <i>You were

Oh, hey.
Mommy!

You guys, I'm home.
Welcome back.

You made it. Heh, heh.
Oh, my love.

SAM:
Welcome home.

FIONA:
Oh, it's so good to be home.

I missed you.
I missed you.

WOMAN:
Burke? Time to go!

Burke.

Burke?

Hey, what you doing, bud?
What's going on?

Come on, we gotta go now.
Stop playing with that.

Me and Daddy never finished it.

Come here.

I miss Daddy.

I miss him too.

So much.

And that's okay
because we're supposed to.

I think this move's gonna be
really good for us.

It's gonna be a new place.

And a new start.

Nothing bad's gonna
happen to me, okay?

Nothing bad's gonna happen
to you either.

I promise.
And it means more

because I'm a police officer.

Come on. I know
first days are hard,

but you gotta do it,
like ripping off a Band-Aid.

I'm scared.

I'm scared too.

What do we do
when we're scared?

Close your eyes
and count to five.

Right.

BOTH:
One, two, three...

four...

five.

Everything's okay.

Let's go to school.

MAN: <i>I hear they stuck
you with the new chick.</i>

Don't call them
"chicks."

Buddy of mine in Vice said
her old man died of cancer.

Real brutal. Kid was
alone with him when he died.

It's only been three months.

Muldoon?

Yeah.


Smoke?

Nah, I quit.

Mind if I do?

Go ahead.

How are you

Uh, we're still

[FLIES BUZZING]

How does something
like this even happen?

Car's been here for months.

Doors were locked
when we found it.

Gruesome, huh?

MICHAELS:
I'll say.

GOODMAN:
Got an ID yet?

MICHAELS:
Sure do.

Got Lorna Moody, 65.

Why did it take so long
to find her?

Well, this here's
a service road.

They only just started
using it for the season.

Anyone come looking for her?

That's just it. The feds,
they're already looking for her.

Turns out she's one of those
assisted-suicide broads.

GOODMAN:
Find anything on her?

Usual stuff.

I got an address though.

Directions
in the glove box.

44 Reyburn Drive.

Same place
as the Landers case.

Looks like
we got another one.

Another what?

What was
the Landers case?

Anything else?

MICHAELS:
Forensics will be here soon.

The FBI is on its way too.

Sure looks like something
was in there with her.

You ever seen anything
like this one before?

Detective...

What's up with
the Landers house?

Worked a case there,
two years ago.

Sort of stuck with me.
Mm.

And it's...

just strange to see it
pop up again.

Maybe they're connected.

It's just a weird coincidence.

MULDOON:
"Entire family murdered."

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Hey! Put that shit away
before Goodman sees you.

Why?
He worked that case there.

He never set foot inside.
Never seen a cop do that before.

Excuse me?

He always used to
feed me.


William was your husband?

Ma'am, are you alone
in the house right now?

Will you help me, please?

Help me.

Help me, help me.

Help me.

Please! No, please!
Don't leave!

Stay there, I'm gonna get help.
No, no, no! No!

[BRAKES SQUEAKING]

[DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE]

GOODMAN:
I heard you the first time!

What are you doing here?

I went to the house.

There's another body.


Come in.

<i>This is my body,
which is given...</i>

The Landers was just...

one of those cases.

Total mess.

Whole family murdered
at the house on Reyburn.

The neighbors too.
Fiona Landers...

She murdered
her 6-year-old daughter.

And then she killed
her husband.

And then herself.

You think the body
that we found was related?

I can't go down
the same road again.

Why did you never
go into the house?

Something never
felt right about it.

Just...

didn't feel right.

What do you mean?

My old partner, he was obsessed.

He said there was...

energy.

Mm, spirits.

Something like that.

You saying
the house is haunted?

People will think you're crazy

if you start
saying shit like that.


Yeah, well, I don't buy that.

I'm sorry, can I
get you anything?

No, I'm good.

Pie?

Not that pie.
Oh, fuck.

Heh, I'm good.


My mother...

she was into
all that ghostly shit.

The older I get,

the more I wanna believe it.

Mm-hm.

She passed away, huh?
Yeah.

I just don't have the heart
to get rid of all this.

I still think of this as...

her house.

Yeah, I understand
how that goes.

How long for you?
Three months.

It was cancer.

I've seen
how that plays out.

I don't wish that on anyone.

I get you're looking
for distractions right now.

Don't get lost
in this shit.

The case, the house...


I know what that looks like.

Okay.

This is the poke.

NINA [WINCING]:
Mm-hm.

That's the needle.
Does it hurt?

No. It's okay.

NURSE: This is where
you're gonna feel a cramp.

DOCTOR:
<i>I have the results.</i>

The amnio confirmed

what we suspected
from the blood work.

The likelihood that your child
will be born with ALD is high.

I know that we've, uh,

previously discussed
various possibilities...

but if you have
any questions now,

I can put you in touch
with some other families.

Helps to hear from other parents
about the realities of this.

But, uh...

there's still a chance, right?

That our baby
will be born healthy?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Reyburn's coming up.
I wanna stop by

[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>I want to start

<i>any questions

WILLIAM: <i>How long will
it take her to die?</i>

LORNA:
<i>Our preferred method is a gas</i>

<i>that requires
the use of a hood.</i>

<i>Once she pulls the hood
down over her head,</i>

<i>she'll be unconscious
in five to 10 seconds.</i>

<i>That's all she'll know.</i>

How many times
have you done this?

I've been
a compassionate presence

at the bedside of 44 people.

Tell me about your wife.

We found out
she was sick last year.

She was pretty far gone...

by the time we realized.

So we moved here...

so she could be closer
to her doctors.

But after the move,

she started getting worse.

I'm so sorry.

I'm glad you called.


Hopefully, I can help.

I hope so.

Mr. Matheson,
I need to warn you.

For anyone to do this,

they must be mentally competent

and physically able to
carry it through themselves.

Is that clear?
Do you understand?

Yeah. Mm-hm.

Shall we go see your wife? Hm?

Mrs. Matheson,
my name is Lorna Moody.

Do you know why I'm here?

Your husband told me
about your condition,

and I'm here to see
if I can help.

Mrs. Matheson,
are you all right?

Peekaboo!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Who are you playing with?

My friend.

LORNA:
And what's your friend's name?

Melinda.

LORNA:
Melinda?

Is she here with us now?


Please, I haven't said...
Mr. Matheson.

I was quite clear
on the requirements,

and I'm truly, deeply sorry,

but your wife is no longer
mentally competent.

Please.

You can't just leave.

I am deeply sorry

for everything you and
your wife have been through...

but you misrepresented
her condition.

What am I supposed to do?

I would still like
to stay a few days,

if that's all right with you.

I may not be able to help
in the way that you wanted,

but at least I could provide
some support, no matter what.

Is that okay with you?

So, what do you like to do
at the playground?

Because I like the swings.

We can swing, swing.

Thank you.

Thank you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I made up
the guest room for you.


We don't get much company.

Oh, it's lovely.

All right, well, I have to run
to the store for some dinner.

Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

Not much in the kitchen either.

Well, let me go.

He's a cop.

What's he doing?

WILLIAM: Who knows?
He worked a case here before we moved in.

Now he won't leave us alone.

A case?

I hope it wasn't a murder.

Oh, God. It was, wasn't it?

You gotta stop it
with this shit.

What's the matter with you?

Does your wife know
what's going on?


You're driving yourself crazy.

You need to leave
that family alone.

I'm sorry I've ever
said anything, man.

about a case that you worked

What can you tell me
about the Landers family?

It's happening again,

Once you step into the place

it never lets you go.

This is never gonna end.

What will never end?

That house's grudge.

You went into the Landers'
house, didn't you?

If you haven't started seeing
them yet, don't worry.

You will.

Maybe we should

so that we can't
see them anymore.


No!

Nobody does that to

<i>Now, ever since I went

<i>I've been seeing shit.</i>

<i>I can't get it out of my head.</i>

<i>There's a case I found
in Japan.</i>

<i>At least a dozen

<i>killed in the same house
in Tokyo.</i>

<i>And I spoke to the detective

<i>He thinks a murder

<i>caused something</i>
<i>called a</i> Ju-On.

Something like a curse.

<i>Fiona Landers worked

<i>And it made her

Goodman.

<i>Can you come over?</i>

<i>I need to talk.</i>

I didn't know
anyone else to call.

This is not
your case.

You have no business
going into this.

But I did.

Was this happening
at all...

before
you went to the house?

I don't know.

And, uh...

now, when I'm closing my eyes,
I can see them.

Whatever happened to Wilson
is happening to me.

And I'm scared.

I can't end up like him.

I'm afraid it's gonna
make me hurt my son.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Where are we going?

I have to try to stop this.
I need to keep you safe.

[CAR DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

Whatever happens, do not
get out of this car, okay?

Do not open this door.

Do you understand?

Promise me?

I promise.

I love you so much.

I told you to stay in the car.

Mommy, please don't do this.

Get back in the car now.

I don't
understand.

Why are you doing this?
I'm scared.

What do we do
when we're scared?

What do we do
