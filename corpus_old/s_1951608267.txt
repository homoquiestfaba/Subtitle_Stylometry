ROOM 6

Where am I?

What's happening?

Hello? Can you hear me?

I can't move.

I can't move. Help me.

Oh my God, I'm awake.
I can't move! Help me!

Oh my God, what are they doing?
They have to hear me.

They have to see I'm awake,
they have to!

Oh God, I can't feel that,
I can't feel what he's doing!

No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

I'm awake! I'm awake!

I have a pretension, they
have to know I'm wide awake!

Thank you, nurse Holiday.

No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

I'm going to make the first incision.

Thank God.

Thank God.

Oh my dear.

We know you're awake.

No. No!

You could wake the dead
with that scream.

Maybe not the dead, but
definitely the neighbours.

It was so real.

Let me guess, you're in the hospital again?

Yeah, something like that.

No, no, come on, don't get up.
All right, it's morning.

It's not morning...
Oh, it is morning.

How cold?
At six.

Why not seven or eight?

Why wake up here when
the morning is like this?

How's your mood?

Black as my coffee.

So, what sort of school is that?

Class 2-C. Melissa Norman again.

Still problems with her?

That ex would have trouble
getting through to that girl.

How about you?
Ransick building.

See we found something to dig.

Listen, Ames. Remember I had something
I wanted to talk to you about?

Now that we're in our
new appartment and stuff...

Let's hurry up, I don't want be late at class.
It's important.

I'm listening.

Real big stuff.

Like I told you last night we need to talk.
We're talking.

No, I'm talking, you're not even listening!

Sure I am!

Maybe this will get your attention.

It's been four years.
Four great years.

Well mostly great years,
we were arguing sometimes...

Nick, I can't do this right now.
Can we talk about it tonight?

God damn it, Ames!

I'm asking you to marry me.

You're serious?

Nick, I love you.

I gotta go. Can we...

Can we pick up where we left off tonight?

Just meet me at school at three, okay?

All right.

So you know why I kept you here
during playtime, right Melissa?

You're having that bad dreams again?

And these things are back?
Monsters.

Monsters, right.

But only in your dreams,
only when you're asleep, right?

Do you remember what I said?

When you're dreaming,
where are you really?

Safe in bed.
Safe in bed, right.

So you just have to remember that.

Do you have your bad dreams?

Yeah.

Did you ever wonder why
you're having bad dreams?

Did you ever wonder what
you did to deserve them?

Do you even know what
you did was so terrible?

Melissa, why did you just say that?
Say what?

Say that I did something... terrible.

What are you talking
about, miss Roberts?

Can I go now?
Yeah, of course.

Melissa you know I'm just
trying to help you.

With the dreams or anything else
that might be bothering you.

Like what?

Excuse me, can I help you?

I don't know, you seem to have
your hands full trying to help my girl.

You're Melissa's mother,
I'm sorry we haven't met yet.

You've not been to any of
the parent-teacher meetings.

So sue me, sweet cheeks.

We were just talking about the
picture Melissa drew in class today.

Oh yeah? Just don't go fill her head
full with that Dr. Phill and Oprah shit.

The kid is weird enough as it is.

I'm just trying to help.

You can't help me.
You can't even help yourself.

You're not strong enough.

I wish you could. You're nice.
Not like the others.

You heard her. But the last thing I need
is more hastle from social services.

Hey. Sorry about this morning.
You just caught me a little off-guard.

Yeah well, when I was coming
I was afraid you've run off.

What's that supposed to mean?
Sometimes you can be a little closed off.

Aren't you supposed to be trying
to be charming right now?

I am charming.
Forget Prince Charming.

I'm the King of Charming.

I just don't get it, Ames.

You love me.
I know you do.

So why don't you wanna marry me?

I didn't say that!
It has to do with your father, right?

That it's not right
to walk you down the isle.

To give you away?
This has nothing to do with him!

Of course, one mention of your dad
and you're all closed off.

What else is new?

Nick, you know what, you don't know
what you're talking about, so just stop it.

I'm sorry, I just love you so much.

I think my leg is broken.
It's okay.

It's okay, honey.

Oh, it's stuck!

Help us! Please!
Somebody help us!

Help! Somebody call 911!
Please!

It's okay. It's gonna be okay, baby.

Thank you, thank you.

Hey, I'm okay, but my boyfriend...
he can't move.

Stay there. Right there.

Where are you going?

Stay there. What a hell
they think I'm gonna do?

Go for a fucking jog?
It's okay, baby.

We're gonna get you out of here,
we're gonna be all right.

I wrecked another car, didn't I?

Yes, you did.

Does this hurt?

We'll take you to the hospital now.

Wait!
Amy.

Sorry lady. You're not allowed
to ride in the ambulance.

You gotta get to the
hospital on your own.

What?

These are the rules, I don't make them,
you don't break them.

What hospital you're taking him to?

I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?

Where's Ames?

She'll meet you at the hospital later.

What hospital we're going to?
St. Rosemary's.

I never heard of it.
They'll take good care of you.

Ames hates hospitals.

They come in nightmares.

Ever since she was a little kid.

A lot of people don't like hospitals.
Not like Ames.

She's gonna have to go now though.

We'll see.

I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's my sister.

Excuse me, how far is
the nearest hospital?

About ten blocks.
Can you take me there please.

Hey there, Norma.

What have you got for me, Francis?
Nicholas Van Dyke.

Leg is busted up pretty bad.

Don't you worry, Mr. Van Dyke.
We're gonna take good care of you.

You're okay, lady?
Yes, I'm fine. I just don't...

I don't like hospitals.
Nobody does.

Except them, hypocondocious types.

Hypohondriacs.
Them too.

I haven't been in the hospital
since I was 12 years old.

You're lucky, my wife breaks a sweat
I gotta take her to the emergency room.

It's all right, Mr. Van Dyke.

You're in the hospital now.

Where's Amy?
I'm sure she's on her way.

Maybe I should go in with
you and hold your hand?

No, I'll be fine.

It's too bad, cause I was gonna
leave the meter running.

You have a good day now, Amy.
Yeah, you too.

How did you know my name?
I didn't tell you my name.

And don't try to talk.

We've given you some
medication for the pain.

I'm here to see my boyfriend,
he was brought in a little while ago.

Brought in, when?

I'm not exactly sure,
within the hour?

What's his name?
Nick Van Dyke.

Sorry, there must be some mistake,
he's not here. It's been quiet.

Who told you he was brought here?
I just assumed...

Are you sure?
Nicholas Van Dyke.

There was a car accident
a few blocks from here.

He'd broke his leg and
ambulance took him away.

They sure as hell didn't bring him here.

We haven't had an
ambulance admission all day.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Do you know where they might have taken him
if they didn't bring him here?

This is a list of all the hospitals in the area.
Maybe they brought him to one of them.

And all the numbers are listed there too.

Maybe you want to give them a call
before you waste any more of your time.

There's a payphone right behind you.
Thanks.

You know I think I'm just gonna
use the phone outside.

Thank you for your help,
thanks so much.

Come on, Amy.
Come on.

Hold it together, it's just a hospital.

People get better, it's where they get saved.
Lady, lady, are you okay?

Oh my God, you were in the accident too.

Are you okay?

I'm in better shape than my truck, yeah.

I'm Lucas, Lucas Dylan.
Everybody calls me Luke.

Hey, I'm Amy.
I'm just so sorry.

I don't have any insurance cards on me,
Nick takes care of all of that stuff.

Don't worry too much about that.

I get to a car wreck like every few months.

Gives me an excuse to get a new one.
I get to town to assignments.

I'm just trying to find my sister
who was in the truck with me.

Is she okay?

They got around, put her in an ambulance and
didn't tell me which hospital they took her to.

The same thing happened
with Nick, my boyfriend.

It's crazy, right?

I just got in the cab and told him to take me
to the closest hospital, which was here.

The same here. She was never even admitted.

They must have taken them
to a different hospital,

but I don't even know
where to start looking.

Fantastic! We can take turns calling,
save us a little time.

Absolutely, I could really use the company,
I'm still just rattled.

You're not in shock, are you?
No... I don't know...

Maybe, I have a thing about hospitals.
I loathe them myself.

What do you think we start
looking at these numbers, Lucas?

Absolutely.

Lie back down.
You need your rest.

Van Dyke.

VAN DYKE.

Yes, I'll hold.

Are you sure?

Or maybe you could check again please.

I was in the car accident with him.
His leg was injured very badly.

The ambulance came,
they took him out,

they drove him away, they
wouldn't let me go with him.

They said it was against the rules.

I've checked every hospital in the area.

And you're the last one on the list.

It's like he disappeared.

Can you please tell me
how that's possible?

Is there anywhere else that they
could have taken him anywhere...

Well fuck you very much!

Excuse me.

Leave him!

He's with us now!

Get away from her!

Leave him!

Look out, look out!

Okay, that's not possible.

That was one lucky dude, I'll say.

Luck? That wasn't luck,
did you see his face?

It wasn't human, it was...
It was something else.

Luke, I feel like I'm going crazy.
No, it's okay, you're worried.

You got a rough day.

Anybody who's been through
what you've been through today...

No, I feel like I'm seeing things.
You're not crazy.

A few years ago I worked in
a hospital and it's not unusual

for people to get a little more imaginative,

shall we say after traumatic experience.

You were a doctor there?
No, I was just an orderly. Sorry.

Or nurse, as my friends used like a joke.

But I do know that I'm right about this.

Hey, do you want me to get
you back to your place?

Which we get back safely?
What do you say?

No, I'm okay.
I'll be fine.

I'm just gonna get home
and wait until tomorrow.

If I don't know where he is by tomorrow,
I'm gonna call the police.

Okay, I'll keep looking tonight,
if I find them I'll call you.

If not I hope you don't mind
if I go with you to the police.

Of couse, yeah.
Either way they'll be fine.

Go home. Get some sleep.

Here we are, Nicholas.
Home sweet home.

Who's the new blood, nurse?

That's Nicholas, he had an accident earlier.

Dr. Kent said he is on
the road to recovery.

It's faster with you looking after.
Too kind, too kind Mr. Brolin.

Oops, pardon me.

Just need a blood sample.
But you guys already got some.

Doesn't hurt to be sure.

Always taking blood this lot, sometimes you
swear it is more of a hobby than a job.

That's enough of that, Mr. McKendrick.
Don't make us put your back on sedation.

Shit, save something for me.
Language, Mr. Van Dyke. Please.

I'll be back later for your
sponge bath, Mr. Van Dyke.

After all, cleanliness is next
to Godliness now isn't it?

Hey!

Hey!

Listen to me, you don't wanna be here.
Quiet, Harrison!

I don't know about you guys, but I'm kinda
looking forward to that sponge bath.

No, no, this place ain't right.
Ask Jamie here.

Something's wrong here.

How long you've been here?

I don't know, I can't remember.

What you've been treated for?

You don't know what you've been treated for?

You were saying something, Mr. McKendrick?

Nothing, nurse Holiday.

Good night then.

Good night, nurse Holiday.
Good night, nurse Holiday.

You have one new message.

This is Sarah Norman,
Melissa's mother.

I guess I'm sorry to bother
you at home and all that,

but Melissa's been saying
some things about you.

She says she needs to see you
and that she can help you.

I hope you know what
that means, cause I don't.

Anyway I'm just passing on the message so the
little darling will leave me alone and go to sleep.

Anyway, you know where we are.

This is crazy.

Hello?

Is anyone there?
Harrison?

James?

Oh, God.

It's okay, it's okay.

This is just a bad dream, that's all.

No need to wake up.

Go back to sleep.

Wakey wakey, rise and shiny.

What happened to the guy
who was in that bed yesterday?

He was discharged last night. All better.

You discharge him in
the middle of the night?

Yes, he was all better.

Better from what?

Time for another blood
sample, Mr. Van Dyke.

But you guys took enough
yesterday's stock of blood bank.

And today is another day.

Don't argue. Does no good to argue.

House always wins, doesn't it?
Don't argue, Mr. Brown.

You know it does no good to argue.

Your turn, Mr. Van Dyke.
Save something for me, will you?

Very amusing, Mr. Van Dyke.

You're quite the merry prankster.

What a hell is wrong with you?
Get your hands off of me!

Excuse me, we'd like to
report two missing persons.

One of them is named Nicholas Van Dyke.

There was a car accident yesterday,
I was in there too.

But I wasn't hurt.
Great. Good for you.

And the ambulance came
and took him away.

Excuse me.

My sister and I were in the same accident.

I luckily just walked away
with a few bruises, but...

But your sister got hurt and the
ambulance came and took her away.

Yeah, but they were different ambulances.

Neither this young lady's boyfriend, nor my sister
were admitted to any local hospitals...

So you think that they were kidnapped?

Abducted. Something like that.

You know what, we don't know that.

You're just wasting police time, right?

What's wrong with you people?

I got nothing better to do here?

You think I got some kind of
special overtime compensation

for filling this bullshit rogue
ambulance stories? Is that it?

Excuse me, two people are missing.

There was a car accident and
the ambulance took them away,

we have no idea where they are...

We're not accusing anybody of anything,
we're not making this up.

We're just looking to get
some help please. Jesus!

That was pretty convincive.

Seriously, that was the best
I've seen yet. Bravo.

Wait, let me guess.

They told you they were taking
them to St. Rosemary's, right?

They didn't tell us where they were taking them.
They didn't say.

No? That's a twist.
That's a new one.

Usually you people say they
were taken to St. Rosemary's.

Hey I got an idea,
just for shits and giggles.

Next time why don't you
drop big foot in there too.

Okay, I'd like to speak to your
supervising officer right now.

You know what, I want you back away
from my desk, right God damn now!

Before I have you arrested for
wasting my time, you understand?

Come on, she's just
being a bitch, let it go.

Leave him.

He's with us now.

What?

What did you just say to me?

Easy, easy, easy!

Did you see her face?
Okay, you know what?

I got a nice cosy little cell
all ready and waiting for you.

That's where you wanna play.

You'll make some nice
new friends back there.

We're very sorry, we're just upset. Thank you.

Thank you very much for your time, thank you.

Yeah, okay.

You didn't see her face, you
didn't hear anything she said?

No, nothing.

We have to make them understand!
To take us seriously!

That's not really gonna work,
you just saw what happened.

They'll think we point some
kind of practical joke,

although honestly
I'm not quite sure why.

You know what, what
are we supposed to do?

Nothing? Just sit around, waiting for Nick and
your sister to come back safe and sound?

They will call. Just as soon as they can they'll
tell us what hospital they were taken to.

We'll go visit them,
everything will be fine.

Amy, we just have to be patient.

I can't do that!

Well, we don't really
have choice now, do we?

I'm sure this is a mix-up.

They were admitted under
different names, files were lost.

That probably happens all the time.

Hasn't it occured to you that maybe they were
too badly hurt to give their names?

You know that maybe they had a relapse
on the way to the hospital,

and they're lying in a coma or...
Stop, stop, don't even say it.

You've thought the same thing.
You're just as scared as I am.

Yes, I mean...
I don't know, Amy.

I choose to believe that they're fine.

This is all one big mix-up.
That's all.

She's gonna call, she's gonna want me
to bring her flowers and chocolates.

Come here.

Caradeli,

that's her favourite chocolates, that's
what she's gonna want me to bring her.

You're probably right.

Asshole.

I'm gonna go. Home, cause
that's the number Nick will call.

I'll call you later, okay?
You promise?

Yeah, I just have to stop somewhere,
but I'll talk to you tonight, okay?

It won't do any good, you know.

They'll never come.

You can call as many times as you like,
but they'll never come.

Hey. What are you doing?

Don't let them see you're doing that.

Oh no, go back to bed,
stay here. Please.

I'm gonna call Amy,
let her know I'm all right.

And after that I'm gonna call my lawyer.

File them, practice on
these sons of bitches.

What are you doing out of bed?

I need a bathroom.
You were given a bed pack.

I saw something in there.

It's just a supply closet, Mr. Van Dyke.
Nothing of interest to you in there.

Open that door.

That's impossible!
Now that's enough, Mr. Van Dyke.

I'll have to insist that
you return to your bed.

You're in no fit state to be
wondering around by yourself.

You're on powerful drugs for the pain.

But an occasional side effect can be
hallucinations, that's all it is.

I suggest you remember that.

It's something wrong with this place.

There's nothing wrong with
this place, Mr. Van Dyke.

It's a fine hospital for finest.

You don't wanna pay attention
to these wild stories.

What stories?

You know perfectly well what stories.

Full of lies. Vicious lies and scandal.

I'm going to ask Dr. Kent
to prescribe you something.

Something to stop these episodes.

What is she talking about, James?
What stories?

I'm talking to you, what stories?

You have one new message.

Hi, Ames. I guess me being at the
hospital has you pretty freaked out.

I'll tell you the truth
I'm freaked out here myself.

Where are you?

Why haven't you visited me?

But if you scared I understand,
but I need you badly.

I need you. Things are weird here.

I don't know, first it's taking blood.

I'm scared, I'm so really scared.

Things aren't right here,
patients going missing.

Discharged maybe, I don't know. Maybe not.

Ames, I gotta go.

Mr. Van Dyke, what
you're doing out there!

Put that phone down.

You can't save him.

He's with us now.

Who the hell are you,
what do you want?

Is this Amy Roberts?
Yes, who is this?

This is Sarah Norman,
Melissa's mother.

I called you and left you a message, I guess
you just didn't feel to need to call me back.

You fear some white trash mom
wasn't worth your time.

Sorry, it's been a rough couple of days.

I don't care none about your sad tales,

you need to get your skinny
white ass over here right now.

Melissa's been saying some weird shit
and it's all your fault.

She won't eat, she won't sleep.
What, what is she saying?

She's been saying
she can help you find him.

Now I don't know what that mean, maybe
I'm giving her too much sugar or something,

but she keeps saying that over and over again.
Does this mean anything to you, sweet cheeks?

I'm on my way.

So I'm here.

Don't make it selling charity.
This is all your fault.

Please, I really need Melissa's help.

This here is Bob. This is a little
brat's teacher from school.

Oh, that's nice.

Don't you get up or nothing,
you rude bastard?

Please Sarah.

Hi.
Hi.

A little one won't shut her trap,

being there yelling all day about meaning
to talk to you about something.

And I don't know what you're
teaching in their school...

Maybe you should start with manners.
Like respect your parents and shit.

You ain't no parent, Bob.
Yeah, not to Marcella.

It's Melissa.

Yeah, I bet you dollars and donats
that I got a little girl

flowing around out there somewhere
in this great nation of ours.

I bet you do.

Miss Roberts, Bob may
not be much on the ice,

but he does have a way
about him, won't you say?

Leave him.

You cannot help him.
We won't let you.

Are you all right, honey?

Maybe I should go talk to
Melissa now, if that's okay.

Now you do that if you need us,
we'll be right out here.

Right, sugar britches?

Stop that asshole, we've got company.

Melissa? You're awake?
You're here.

Your mom called, she said
you needed to talk to me.

You wanted to talk to me.

You know the monsters
are real now, don't you?

Sometimes I think I see them,
but I'm not sure.

You can't find him.
You don't know where he is.

No. No, I don't.
Do you?

Yes.
Where?

Sweety, where is he?
St. Rosemary's.

St. Rosemary's...
I've heard that name before.

You can find him if you really want.

You've never told anybody why
you're so very afraid of hospitals.

I did something terrible
once some long time ago.

I never talked about it.
I never told anyone.

Before this is over,
I think you should.

Time for your pills, Mr. Van Dyke.

What are they for?
To help you sleep of course.

Very good.

What's the matter, my child?

I don't know how to say this.

I feel like I'm going crazy.

Well, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

And I hope you'll find
the peace you're looking for.

Thank you.

Hey, Father.
Yes, child.

I know I haven't been righteous in a long time,
I mean not since my father...

Not since I was a little girl.

I'm just so scared and I'm confused.

And I don't understand
what's happening to me.

Amy.

Are you all right, child?

No.

Please, if you'd like, I can get you
into a rehab program we run here.

It could prove very helpful for you.
No, you can't help me.

Only I can.

Hey, thanks for coming.

You're okay?
Yeah, I will be.

I need you to listen for a minute.
Yeah. Sure. Whatever you need.

What do you want?
A research.

What are we researching?
St. Rosemary's hospital.

May I ask why?
A ten year old girl told me I should.

Okay, it makes sense.

Excuse me, can you tell me
where street section is?

Upstairs, on the right.
Great, thanks.

You're welcome, Amy.

Hello? We're looking for any information
you might have about St. Rosemary's hospital.

My dear, why would you want to read
about that dreadful place?

It's a long story.
What do you know?

Just the usual.

The place was destroyed years ago.

Many years ago, before you were born.

Raised to the ground in a
terrible fire they started.

Who is they?

The doctors, the nurses, the orderlies.

The entire staff started it some said.

Why did they do it?
Nobody knows for sure.

It was for something so terrible, they all chose
to stay and die in the fire rather than escape.

Back then there were rumors.
Stories, back from before the fire.

Tales of sacrifices, devil worship.

Patients that would vanish
and never be seen again.

Blood rituals to preserve eternal youth.

And the rumor spread that in one night
the whole building went up in flames.

And nobody got out alive.
Nobody?

People came to see and told
how they could see into the fire.

And have nobody even tried to escape.

That they just sat down and waited to die.

Waited for the flames to take them.

A terrible cursed place.
Thankfully gone now forever.

I have to get home.

Wait! Please wait!

My cats don't wait to get hungry.
So I don't wait to feed them.

What is it?

I've seen these people before.
They've been dead like 60-70 years.

You couldn't have.
I've seen them in my dreams.

Thanks again for taking me home, Lucas.

I'm still a little bit freaked.

What are you doing?
Where are you going?

I'm gonna head back to
the hotel and check out.

I should probably head back south.

You can't! What about your sister?
I don't really have a choice.

Okay you know what, just stay here.

I'm gonna take a shower and we'll order food,
and sit down and discuss this, okay?

Whatever you say, boss.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

You were screaming.
I'm sorry.

So I think I know where Nick and your sister are,
but I don't think you're gonna believe me.

Where?

St. Rosemary's hospital.

They can't be.
It burned down, remember?

Yeah, I know. I don't know how they're there.

I know that they are and
that they need our help.

You love him very much.
Yeah, I do.

My whole life I've dreamed of meeting
someone who'd love me that much.

You're so special. So special,
I knew it the first time we met.

And beautiful. When I saw you standing
there in your bathroom. Naked.

I didn't just wanna come for you,
I wanted to hold you in my arms.

I wanted to caress your breasts,
I wanted to be inside of you.

Lucas.

Cause you're even more beautiful
on the inside than you are on the outside.

Lucas, what are you doing?

What I wanted to do since
the second I laid eyes on you.

Lucas, I'm sorry I can't.
I can't do this.

Yes, you can. Shh.
Just close your eyes and forget.

Lucas, I can't. Nick.

Okay, I won't do anything. I promice.

Just close your eyes.

Lucas, I'm... I'm sorry, I love Nick.

You just, you have to understand that.

Nick is gone.

What?
He's gone.

Well, you can't help him.
Lost forever.

And you can't help him.

You're too afraid to help him.
He's gone. Leave him.

He's with us now.

After what happened to your dad,
you know you can't help him.

You're only 12 years old, but you remember it
like it was yesterday, don't you?

You'll never forget that day.
I know I won't.

The look on your daddy's face,
the pain in your daddy's eyes.

And that terrible thing you did.
How could you forget?

I promise you, he hasn't either.

Do you remember the way he was before?
No! Just leave me alone!

The way he picked you up?
Swing you around?

Let you ride on his shoulders,
take you to the park.

And then his face. And its smell.
It's a smell of death.

You remember what you did, Amy.

To your own father,
you remember what you did.

I had no choice!
Yes, you did.

And you chose to become one of us.
No, I didn't.

You're one of us, Amy.

Why can't you just admit it to yourself?
Leave me alone!

Ah, that hurt.

Hello again, lady.
Go.

Go? Where do you wanna go?
St. Rosemary's hospital.

St. Rosemary's.
I thought you'd never ask.

You're sure that's
where you wanna go, doll?

Yes.
Okay.

Next stop, St. Rosemary's.

What's happened in here?

Oh, dear nurse.

Yes, what a pity, Dr. Kent.
Obviously delusional...

Quite. I think we don't have
a choice, nurse Holiday.

Yes doctor, there really is only one choice.
We're going to have to operate.

We're here.

It doesn't look like it.
Just wait.

I can take you back home if you want.

No.

You can leave him if you want.

No.

If you go in there, you
may not come back out.

I don't care. I'd rather live inside there
with Nick than live out here without him.

Wait, that little girl wanted
me to ask you something.

Melissa Norman?

Yeah, if that's a name
you've got for her, sure.

She wanted me to ask you why
you are so spooked about hospitals.

When I was 12 my father went to
the hospital for a routine operation.

Something went wrong
with the anaesthetic. And...

He was hurt. He suffered brain damage.
He was crippled.

Nothing like the father I loved so much.

So what happened after?
Something terrible.

Where am I?
What's happening?

Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?

I can't move.

I can't move. Help me.

Oh my God, I'm awake.
I should be out there.

I can't move.

Oh God, I can feel that.
I can feel what they're doing.

Oh no, I have to get their attention.
They have to know that I'm awake.

They have to know.

Thank you, nurse Holiday.

I'm awake!

Help us! Please let us go!

Please help us!

Please open this door!
I'm looking for Nickolas Van Dyke.

Open this door and
we'll take you to him.

He's in surgery.

If I let you out,
you'll take me to him, right?

Yes, of course we will.

You got blood on your hands too!
Only you can't feel it yet!

Come on!

Amy?

Daddy?

Amy.
Daddy is that you?

Amy, it's me.

ROOM 6

Daddy!
Hello, Amy. I've missed you so much.

I've missed you too.

Don't be afraid, it's over now.
I was so afraid.

It's over, we can go home now.
I'll protect you. It's over.

No, with Nick.

I said you're coming home with me.

No, I have to help Nick!

How could you let this happen, Amy?

Look at me, you like that?
It was an accident.

Yeah, an accident.
You did this.

You did this to me.

Amy, come over to see daddy.

Closer.

Oh God, Ames!

It really hurts, it really hurts me.

Daddy?
Ames, listen to me.

I want you do something for daddy.
Only you can do it.

Ames, baby. I'm not coming home.

It don't even let me sleep.

We're never gonna
play again like before.

I'm trapped here Ames. I'm stuck.
This machine won't let me go.

How can you grow up
and go to college, marry

with me tearing you at this hospital.

You'll be crippled too.

I want you to do this thing for me.

I want you to set me free, Ames.

You'll die.
I'm already dead!

It's not living, it's not a life.

Not for a man like me.

They can't help me.
Nobody can help me.

Only you. You can do this for me, Ames.

I'm begging you to do it for me. For us.

Do it, Ames.

Don't do it, don't do it,
please, don't make me do it.

Yes, do it.

No, don't do it,
don't do it.

Yes Ames, yes.

Daddy! Daddy!

Daddy! Daddy! Help!

Daddy!

Amy!

Come back!

You belong here.

You belong with us.

I don't belong here.
Yes, you do.

His blood is on your hands.

You know that.
You're one of us.

You murdered your own father!

Amy.

Amy!

Fuck you!
Fuck me?

I'd love to. Things I could do to you.

The places I can take you.
The places we can go together.

So what do you say we get out of
these rather unfashionable clothes?

Fuck...
You can do better than that!

Profanity is not very profane
when it's used perpetually.

I am feeling the more time
we spend together,

the more you're gonna get to like me.

Don't you know where you are?

This is where you belong.

Tonight the fire is going to consume you
just as it consumed everything.

And then finally, you'll be one of us. Forever.

Don't worry about Nick. Nurses will
take good care of him, I promise.

Let's get started, shall we?

We might still have time
to get a night golf.

I'm awake. Please.
I'm awake. Don't!

I'm about to make first incision.

No!

Thank God!

Oh my dear, we know you're awake.

No. No! No!

Stop! Stop this!

That's it then.

Looks like we won't have time
for that golf after all.

You're not gonna run?

That's best if we stay here.

This is where we belong.

Just go! Just leave me Ames, go!
Like hell! Come on, Nick.

Don't run, Amy.
You don't understand.

Tonight fire will consume you
and you will be one of us forever.

This is where you belong.
No, I don't!

EXIT

Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

Ames.

It was just a test.

It was all a test, wasn't it?

What was a test?
I love you, Nick.

I love you so much.

Please remember that, okay?
I love you too.

You just hang in there.

You're gonna be okay.
No.

But it's okay.
I'm not afraid.

Ames, stay for me.
I can't.

It's time for me to go.
I passed the test.

Why the hell are you talking about test?

I love you.
Stay with me!

I can't.

Can we get an ambulance over here?

Who is she?
I don't know.

I thought I knew her,
but I was wrong.

I think she watches over me.

I love you. I would have married you.

Don't be afraid.

I'm not afraid.

Not anymore.
