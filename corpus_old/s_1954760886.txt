Good morning, Mr Fredricksen.
You're ready to go?

I'll meet you at the van. Just a minute.

I wanna say
one last goodbye to the old place.

Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

Typical!

He's probably going to the bathroom
for the 80th time.

You'd think
he'd take better care of his house.

So long, boys!

I'm standing adjacent to the location
where yesterday,

onlookers witnessed a liftoff
by what some are calling,

"A flying house."

Tell us what you saw.

Construction workers in the area say
the flying house belongs to this man,

recently convicted public menace,
Carl Fredricksen.

City officials say
the search will continue,

but after yesterday's storm,

<i>there may be no clues as to where</i>

<i>Carl Fredricksen</i>
<i>and his house have gone.</i>

<i>It appears as if elderly public menace</i>
<i>Carl Fredricksen</i>

<i>has indeed escaped.</i>

Attaboy, Carl!

Okay. Here we go.

Are you ready?

Yeah. Okay.

Good morning, Mrs Peterson.

You ready to go...

Oh, no!

So long, suckers!

Afternoon, boys!

Mr Fredricksen?

That was so cool!
Let's do that again, Mr Fredricksen.

But next time, I wanna steer.

That was the craziest thing
I've ever seen!

Hi, there.
