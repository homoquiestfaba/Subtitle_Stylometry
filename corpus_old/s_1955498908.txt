(Loud music on headphones)



(Crows chirping)

(Thunder rumbles)

So...

My place...

Or yours?

(Door opens)

Make yourself at home.

Thank you.

Here you go.

Here's one...

So what do you do?

I'm an investor.

Mining.

Diamonds.

Actually, I'm more on
the human side of things.

Where are you from?

I'm from Paris.

Paris.
Mm-hmm.

I love Paris.


My ex is from there.

Are you looking
for a replacement?

Only if you feed me

with news.

I'm Zoe Porter.

And you're watching
avi world news.

Here are the highlights
of the day.

Dr. Danielle Laura,
financial advisor from Toronto,

is among several
journalists missing

after an alleged
vampire attack in Paris.

It is speculated that drakula
is trying to scare the city

into submission,

a tactic used by drakula
and his cult members

for centuries.

Among the missing
is Ronnie keld from Paris

who was traveling through
the carpathian mountains.

We now go live
to Paris, France

where our correspondent,
Beatrice arsenault,

has the latest.
Hi, Beatrice.

What can you tell us
about the missing victim?

Hi, Zoe.

It isn't clear
what drakula's motives would be,

but there is a lot of
speculation that the victims

were murdered because of
their connections to the media.

There has been a lot
more exposure on drakula

and the cult in recent times.

And this attack
could be meant as a warning.

Can you tell us anything about
the leaked video footage?

The video
has been taken down,

and avi news
has evidence

against some of
the drakula cult members.

Is our legal system
failing us

when it comes to drakula
and his cult?

Your thoughts.

Well, Paris sentiment is that
it is time to ratify our laws

so that we have
great authority

to prosecute vampires
and vampire supporters.

They are a cult
that has made it clear

they have little regard

for all victims...
And life itself.

There are rumors...

Hey, emmy, it's me.

Pick up. It's urgent.

Listen, I'm coming to Paris.

Call me back.

(Camera shutters clicking)

(Reporters chattering)

People need
vampires because...

We are sad.

Politics suck,

country sucks.

We need to see
drakula for...

For fantasy,

for...

For laughing.

For thinking
about love and...

And, yeah...

To dream.

Drakula and his cult members
have been the prime suspects

in many missing
persons cases.

The mission
is normalization.

This mission
is the new order.

Drakula's stocks
are set to triple

as he gains support.

Drakula is seen
as a kind of superstar

who is half crazy

trying to get
the inside scoop for the case.

The death toll from
the latest vampire attack

continues to rise.

I love watching vampires.

I feel great when I see one.

I feel very good inside.

Like I'm somebody.

You are the usual?

Yeah.

Watch the street.

Sorry.

(Speaks French)

(Door buzzer buzzes)

(Shower running)

Oh, how nice to see you!

Emmy!
Emmy!

It's good to see you!
When did you get in?

Yesterday.

Valia didn't tell me
you were here.

I'm happy.
(Moans)

Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

Hey, we're in
this together.

You're gonna have
the adventure of a lifetime.

Mm.

Oh, you know,

it's so good to work
with people

who are interested
in vampires.

I'm stoked.
Ugh!

I'm just gonna
have a quick shower.

I'm so jet-lagged.

I got it.

Hey, try to stay up
as long as you can.

I'll try.

(Police sirens)

Oh, thank you.

You want?

It doesn't make sense.

Who disclosed details
about the killings

on social networking sites?

And why were incriminating
photographs removed from sites?

Paranoid and narcissistic
creeps, cult members,

who intimidate people,

savaging the reputation
of drakula's family

and their lives,
protecting their

whereabouts.

I know that
the images are sensational

and very explicit.

There's every possibility
that it could get worse.

According to my source,
what they have is amazing.

Why this?

Why now?

I'm interested in
finding the truth.

That you will
never get to sell.

You know
that it's impossible.

They will
finish you off

like agina.

There are things
you shouldn't interfere with.

Go home or write
about something else.

No, no.
You don't understand.

I want to hear
their side of the story.

It's a huge media interest.

The mission is called
normalization.

The term "normalization"

is used by
this group of vampires

to describe the sect
who kill with impunity

resulting in
a civil unrest and demand.

In their view,
this division

is the new order.

Uniting a family

dedicated
to an heroic existence.

Those alive,
those not yet born,

and those already dead.

Okay. So?

So there's slow burn
in process at the castle.

Put the media on.

Ignore and move on.

What's the issue really?

This issue is privacy
not behavior.

It's jealousy.

The fuckers aren't as rich
and having as much fun?

Surprise, surprise.

It appears
history repeats itself

and is a good fit
for the silly world

of journalists.

Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm.


It's my job to cut through
the spirit of social rebellion

so the rest of the world
can dignify it.

But it's up to the world
to decide.

I'm sure that the people
of transylvania will be happy

the country
is being talked about...

Famous once more.

The issue is

no people will criticize
drakula's family out of fear.

The nominal role in society
is an insult to people

who have generally risked
their lives or body parts

because no one will dare to say
a bad word about the family.

But drakula doesn't care
what you think

and neither do the vampire.

What the fuck
do you think it is?

Twilight?
Sleeping in coffins?

A stake through the heart?

Oh, oh, I got it.

Ah, ah, ah...

It's changing
shapes and forms.

Oh, I gotta go!


Text me pictures
of the cult?

I want to see.

You never listen, Hannah.


See you soon.

(Thunder rumbles)

(Police siren wailing)

(Computer keys clicking)

I'm hungry
for the new order.

Yeah, we all news lovers
suffering from...

Yes.

I'm willing to risk fines
for my company if...

Yeah,

if the benefits for boosting
circulation and revenues

outweighs any fines
for breaching the law.

Okay.

See you at the party.

Okay, bye.

Meeting with Christian
is set up.

Who is he?

This guy I met
in Vancouver.

Is he a journalist?

Nope,

but I want him to help us.

To get him involved.

His money
and his connections

could get us info on the cult.

(Phone chimes)

Hey, Nate arrives
tomorrow from Amsterdam.

He is the journalist
I was talking about.

Great.
Can't wait to meet him.

Mm, did Xavier
send you the pictures?

Uh-uh. He's going to
encrypt them first.

Glass of wine?
Oh.

That sounds lovely.

(Bell tolling)

(Horn honking)

Oh, it's so
good to see you.

You had a good trip?
Are you tired?

No, no, no.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

But I do have to meet
Xavier in two hours.

Cool.

Hey, come on, let's go.

Yeah, let's go.

(Bell tolls)

(Heavy exhale)



Isn't she beautiful?

New visitors in town.

What do they know?

I don't know, Leon.

Things could get

out of hand, Corvinus.

What do they want?


They want to be us.


We're going to have to find
a new environment for them,

one in which
they can grant protection

for lives
and the lives of others?


I'm going to send you
to transylvania.


You'll remain there
until we find a reason

to make a change.


I wish to present Nate,
a good friend of mine.

Nice to meet you.
Mm-hmm.

(Speaking French)

No.

Let's see a price.


(Speaking French)

Okay?

Okay.

Okay.

That's okay for you?

No, just, uh,
I just want this key.

I want to get cracking.

You guys are heading out?

Yep.
Well...

It was a pleasure.

Bye, Nate.
Merci.

Sure we can trust them?
Yeah, we can.

It's okay.


Hey!

Hi!
Hey.

Oh, my God!
Look at you!

How are you?
Good, how are you?

(Speaking French)





We have to talk.

I have something
important to tell you.

We have to be
in sync on this.

We're in sync, baby.

Yeah?

Okay, then.

You're blushing.
Me?

Yeah.
No.

Yeah.
(Giggles)

That's a nice place.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Cheers.

(Speaking French)

Ooh.
A hugger?

A kisser.
Oh.

Ask her.

Do you mind if I
steal him for a bit?

No, it's okay.

No, it's all right.

It's all right,
it's okay.

Okay.

I'm not into a foursome.

After tonight,
you will be.

Guys, meet Christian.

Hey, I'm Nathaniel.
You can call me Nate.

I stream video footage

and broadcast
the best fucking footage

you'll ever see

or hear.


Hi. Emmy.
Editor for az magazine

and I'll publish your
mother's ass off.

My mother's ass?

Hi, I'm Xavier.

(Speaking French)

Thanks, guys, for coming.

And for helping me
with this project.

It really means a lot to me.

(Laughing, chattering)

We need to look everywhere,
online, the fucking church,

library...

People, places, names.

The bloggers on this...
Talk to people.

What about
the government?

The cult?

Need a code or a sign.

I promise
I will publish everything.

It's a flattering
profile on the cult.

We need information
and we need it fast.

(Speaking French)

Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

Made extra money.

How much? How much?

How much money?

Big money.

(Speaking French)

I was part of the group
studying minerals in water.

Cool.

And did you see
those kids with...?

Hey, Christian.

Christian tells me
that he built a school

in Africa? Romania?

That's great.

Maybe he can take us there.
We can blog about it.

Well, I got to go.

See you soon.

Bye.

Well...

Let's have dinner
on Friday night and talk.

Deal.
Deal.

(Door opens)

(Door closes)


What are you looking at?

You.
Hmm.

Are you drunk again?
No, I'm not drunk.

You're working too much.

I'm a little bit drunk.

Time, time,

what can I do?

We need a strategy
to control the enemy and...

And compromise
their weakness.

You can hack
into their email.

Would it be safe?

Safe is boring.
Yeah, I know.

But we have
to communicate mostly by

encrypted Internet chat.

Melanie thinks
footage was leaked

from a former cult member
to a finance journalist.

Melanie?
Yeah.

Nate and I met her
earlier tonight.

(Goth music plays)

(Goth music continues)





Why?

Why did you do this?

Stop.

Why?

Why did you do it?


Oh, my poor baby.

You don't like my pleasure.


(Bell tolling)

This is not drakula's castle.

This is vlad's castle,

the real one.

Seven castles
all claiming to be

drakula's this,

drakula's that,
drakula's...

How the fuck
am I supposed to find it?

Not all transylvanian sites
are associated with vlad.

That guy was a
bad ass motherfucker.

To join his legion,
each man had to let out

blood into a glass
from which they all drank

uniting the legion in death.

To this day,
people claim they see him

riding a horse

in the carpathian mountains.

Where did you hear that?
Oh, my dad is an historian.

I grew up in those stories.

(Reading names)

They are painters.
Don't get it.

You know what?

Let's Cypher the names
and send it to Nate.

You bet.

Secret crimes.

May...

May... Me...

It's a g.

Gula.

Caligula.
(Email tone)

This is what Nate sent.

Look.
Here.

"The cult extorted
cash and property,

facilitated human
trafficking for blood."

"Over the past year,
the cult has launched

one reality
television series."

"The cult is filming
sacraments on drakula

based in caligula"?

The Roman emperor caligula

who used vile means
to get to the throne.

So the cult
is making films?

They're doing remakes

based on old cult classics.

Let's go.

It consists of more than
a hundred engravings...

More than 50 drawings,

and encrypted Internet code.
Okay,

but is there anything on it
about the cult in transylvania?

I couldn't break the code.
(Sighs)

Nate, you have
to be careful.

Good luck.

I've decoded
some of Xavier's data.

Looks pretty interesting.

Oh, my proxy server's
being so slow today.

You know, looks like
there's a lot of information

here about the royals

and some prince
of transylvania.

Note to self.

Some of the names
I was able to crack, however,

looks like they are linked
to some sort of live footage.

(Snapping fingers)
It's gotta be, um...

Yes. A movie called
"secret crimes."

Look for it.

(Computer beeps)

Judging by these names,
they could be doing films

based on these peoples' work.

Bathory.

Mm, interesting.

But Elizabeth Bathory
wasn't the painter.

She was a serial killer...


Bathing in her victim's blood
to retain her beauty and youth.

That's
the fucking name.

"Bathory."

Encode it
and see what happens.

Could be ciphered.
Type "countess."

(Computer beeps)

(Beep, beep)


Bingo!
Hah!

Okay, here.

Type this in.

See if it works.

Uh, en dot walashia,
slash, movie.

Nothing?

Try zalia.

(Beep, beep)

(Beep, beep)
Ah, look at that.

One-time conspirator
and cult leader

planting fear
and physical terror.

Fuck.

(Loud noise)
(Gasping)

Here are the codes and signs
you are looking for.

Okay. The money
is in your account.

Fuck.

Thank you.

You must be careful.


Is that the same drive?

It all came from Xavier.

(Computer beeps)

Hey.

Looks like LA Bella lomond

hacked into the email
of some corvinas

exposing the wrongdoings
of the cult.

Who the fuck is corvinas,
and why are we following him?

You're gonna
have to ask Xavier

if he can get us

into a high-tech
facility.

(Knocking on door)

Okay, you gotta be
kidding me, right?

Oh, come on.
Old technology dies hard.

We're gonna die here.
No.

It's exactly
what we need.

What? 1980's?

No. 1980's, yes.
1970's, that thing,

if it works.
Ah, cool.

You guys wanna
see what I did?

Yeah.
Come on.

Now take a seat.

(Computer keys clicking)



Oh, click on the fish.

Holy fuck.

(Woman whimpers)


It's a tough life
being a messiah.

Unfortunately, I can't be
your Mary magdalene

and bathe your feet.

However...
(Crying)

I can save you from this

if you give me
the name of your fellow

investigative journalist.

I don't know her name.

Oh.

I shall be guilty
of drinking your blood.

Let me prove myself

and so to let me
eat of your body,

let me drink
of the cup.

Oh...

My martyr.

(Church bell tolls)

(Bell tolls)





Oh...

Oh, my...

What?

Xavier was found dead.
It's all over the news.

Look.


(Computer beeps)
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Take a look at this!

Come here!

My battery is very low.

That's the missing girl
veronique!

Please.

Please help me.

I've been abducted.

I'm thirsty.

I want blood.

Hello.

We have to find that place.


Wanna do it here?

Yep.

There is a slow explosion
in the cult

and a subject
of controlled silence

by the dominant forces.

There can be no motivation

other than greed.

Hannah David,
world news, Paris.

Cut!

Looks great, hon.
Good job.

Okay, cool.
Let's go.

(Growls, chuckles)

(Woman screams)



(Heavy breathing)

Is everything all right?

Yes.

Are you sure?

I was lying on the sofa...

Naked and it hit me.

You have connections
in transylvania.

So...

What's the event?

I want to find veronique,
a missing girl.

A vampire.

Where?

In transylvania.

How do you know
she's there?

Sources.

She can be anywhere.

Trust me.

She's there...

Somewhere.

If I can leak this,
it will be a triumph.

It could work.

It will cost you.

But I don't see why not.

How much?

10, 20 gs.

I could help as well.

Hm?
Really?

I will pay you
for the goods.

I know you will like it.

Best thing you'll ever do.

I know of a woman with some
incredible legends to tell.

She lives in
the carpathian mountains.

In a castle?

No, no, in a house.

But apparently,
she's a crone.

My God!
I have goose bumps.

Can I interview her?

I think so.

I'll make it happen.


I wanted to let you know
that I'm going to transylvania.

Done deal.

Well, you're not going alone.

I don't wanna force you.

Christian is on board.

And I'm in.

Of course.

Hey, we're in
this together.

All right.
Yeah.

All right.

Yeah, wait...

Behind the orthodox church.

Okay, cool.

See you there.

Okay, bye.

Okay, do you know
where that is?

Uh, that street to the left.

Okay, let's go.

So, we agreed
to 2,000 Euros.

And you tell them
what you know,

or what you don't know.

Got it?

2,000?

My underwear
costs more than that.

So, uh...

Five grand or I walk.

Two grand and you talk.

Oh, they're coming.

You always do this to me.

Hannah.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

Hey.
Nate.

Nate, nice to meet you.
Hi.

Emmy.
Hello.

Gabriella.

Well, here we are
in beautiful transylvania.

Great place for an interview.

Gabby will tell you everything.

I was walking by
the fortified reformed church

on Parker street
here in cluj

when I saw that woman
covered in blood.

Her hair, her clothes.

She told me
that she was robbed,

but I know
that she was bitten

by somebody
or something.

She gave off
a magical aura.

What happened after?

I wanted to take her
to the hospital

but she wouldn't.

She was talking about
signs and types on buildings.

Such as the synagogue,
the center of our predators.

But there are those
signs that are bad luck.

She was pretty out of it.

I thought she was crazy,

but when we got
to king ferdinand street,

there it was.

A sign painted on
the side of a building.

It was very big.

So which building?

The yellow one.

What was the sign.

A raven.

She was talking about
the COD and the prince.

The prince?
The prince of...

Prince of transylvania.

Reckless, evil doings.

Like what?

She said the new order
and New York.

So, guys,

this is the place
what I wanted to show you,

the most important,
the most special because

this is the place where
I saw her for the last time.

You know what I mean?

Come on.

Watch for the bats.

So...

What do you
think about it?

Is this is where you got her?
Yeah.

She was up there.

Yeah, you can take
some pictures.

That's what I'm doing.

Oh, my God!

Oh, shit!



Stay behind me,
stay behind me.

Shh, shh, shh.


Hey!

(Phone rings)

Hey.

Bit of a problem.

The asset is
in another city

in a town called sighisoara.

Are you sure you
wanna do this?

Yeah, it's worth it, yeah.

Hell, yeah,
I wanna meet 'em.

I wanna interview
with the fucking guy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

Yeah, they're fine, yeah.

Meet you where?

Okay, cool.
See you soon.

Thank you.

Okay, see you there.

Everything that gives rise
to the telling of this story

occurs in drakula's
transylvania

where he was raised.

Uh, where is Christian?

He's in the old clocktower
near there.

Oh, okay.

(Bell tolling)

(Phone rings)

Hey.

Okay.

Call you back in five.

Along here I saw her walking
out from that building.

Blooded.

Blooded, blooded.

Along here,
I saw her blooded

walking out
from that building.

And what happened?

I wanted to help her,

but she says I can't.

No one can, no one can.

That's sounds pretty good.

Add a bit of paprika to it,

little village story,
the carpathians.

Well, come on.

You're the shaman,
for fuck sakes!

How much you want?

1,000 Euros.
(Laughs)

No.

500.

I'll tell them the truth.

Okay, okay, 500, 500.

(Phone chimes)
500.

Along here, I saw her...

Hey, man!
You shut up.

Speak only in
Romanian with them.

Make it 1,000, man.

You made a lot of money
on the African deal.

You have to figure out how
to benefit from the new order.

You'll be great.

(Speaking Romanian)

Love it.

10 g.

Let's do this?

Let's do it.

So what can you tell us
about vlad the impaler?

(Speaking Romanian)

It's a high Mountain pass
and it's dangerous.

What do you know about
the order of the dragon?

(Speaking Romanian)

To defend the cross
and fight the turks.

I know, but I heard
that the dragon society

has members in this town

operating today.

I don't know any members.

I'll give you 10,000 Euros

if you show me a member
and their symbol.

He doesn't know shit.

You can see them at night.

Where?

They use
the covered staircase

which leads up to the church

on the hill.

It can be anyone.

They have a place in covasna

named after a very famous
mineral water.

Okay, I go.

What the fuck?
He's full of shit!

You know the place.
I know you do.

When you didn't drink
your mineral water in Paris.

First time we met,
you said something about

water in Africa.

What the fuck
is going on here?

I paid you 10 grand, man!
What the fuck is going on here?

It's not that easy.

It's dangerous.

I don't have the location.

He's the shaman.
You fucking liar!

Come on.

I paid you!


You fuck!




(Screaming in distance)


I don't know what to do.

We move on.

(Speaking Romanian)

Can you tell us about
the symbol at the entrance?

(Speaking Romanian)

They use the symbol
marking the path

so people don't fall
into treachery.

Oh, we want to be safe.

Do you recognize her?

Please help me.
I've been abducted.

Do you recognize this place?

I want blood.

(Speaking Romanian)

She was told
about veronique.

Seen her in a house
with the symbol of a fish.

It's not far.

Walking distance
to the village across

either side.

The path is dangerous.
My way is safe.

We only need an interview
with veronique.

And the prince.

Look for a house with
the symbol of a fish.

(Phone rings)

Emmy?

Yeah.

No.

No, I don't see it.

No, nothing.

Nothing?

Well, okay, where?

Okay.

Hannah?

Hannah?

Emmy, meet me up the hill.

Do you hear me?

I...

(Wind howls)



(Heavy breathing)





(Phone rings)




Christian, stop!

Stop, please, stop!

Please! No!


Why?

Why, Christian?
