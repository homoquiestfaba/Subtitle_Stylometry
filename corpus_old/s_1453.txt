She wouldn't tell me her husband's name.
She wouldn't even write it.

She knows not to speak
the names of the dead.

Zuwanie's murdered half the town.
How could it get any worse?

With Zuwanie, he could murder the other half.

??

No. Just us, they said.

Xola's right, Philippe.

You've done well, my friend, but just us.

I'll do the talking.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to take a 15-minute recess now.

We will advise you further

<i>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the situation in Matobo</i>
<i>has now become critical</i>.

<i>With Ajene Xola in hiding</i>
<i>and Kuman-Kuman in exile,</i>

<i>Edmond Zuwanie has few domestic obstacles</i>

to his policy of ethnic cleansing.

<i>The Security Council therefore</i>
<i>must press for his immediate referral</i>

<i>to the International Criminal Court</i>
<i>in The Hague</i>.

Miss Broome.

I'm Jonathan Williams, Ambassador Harris's
adviser. We need you for a few minutes.

Which language?
The Matoban ambassador. He'll speak Ku.

Ku?
You speak the language, don't you?

Let's be clear, Mr Ambassador.
[Silvia translates into Ku]

The United States may not recognise the ICC
as a legitimate court,

but we do not condone the methods
President Zuwanie uses against his people.

[Speaks Ku]

Dr Zuwanie is an educator.

He is... our teacher.

But his opponents
engage in ever more ferocious acts.

The partisans of both Kuman-Kuman
and Ajene Xola have become...

terrorists.

The French proposal
is a diplomatic headache for both of us.

What a predicament.
It doesn't have to be.

Dr Zuwanie wouldn't have to appear
before the International Criminal Court.

Not if he were somewhere else.

Do you want him to resign?
Tell him this.

If he goes voluntarily, we're confident
the French proposal will be vetoed.

[Speaks English] You can tell him yourself.

He will be here next Friday,

exercising his right
to speak before the General Assembly,

where he will announce
a new programme of democratic reform.

Perhaps then there will be no vote
and your predicament will disappear.

<i>[Silvia] It will end here</i>.

The Teacher will never leave this room alive.

That's it.
"The Teacher will never leave this room alive."

Word for word.

And what language did you say?
Ku.

It's a tribal dialect of Matoban, spoken
throughout the south central African belt.

Did you see anyone?
No, but I think that they saw me.

Why didn't you report this last night?

It didn't mean anything to me at the time.

Rather, I didn't know what it meant.
But now you do.

I heard something today.

I don't know if I'm permitted.

It was in a closed...
You are.

In fact, you're obligated,
as you were last night when you didn't.

I think they were talking
about Edmond Zuwanie.

He's planning to come here
to address the GA.

Can you see her?

Turn on the light.

Call the Secret Service.

[# Zenvox: Bump]

Bet you really miss this. Welcome back.

Ma'am? Excuse me.
Please don't touch the Prime Minister.

<i>[cell phone rings]</i>
I need you to step back, please.

Woods.

[Raised voices]

The first of the demonstrators.

They're here to protest the appearance
later this week by Edmond Zuwanie.

Not just his political future
but any future for him

hinges on that speech
to the General Assembly.

Dr Zuwanie is accused of genocide,

but he's expected to argue that his actions
were a defensive response to terrorism

and not acts of aggression, as some
Security Council members have charged.

Secret Service.
Just a moment, please.

We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection.

It's a branch of the US government.
Dot.

This is international territory.
I need you to wait for an escort.

<i>Zuwanie lands at 8.45 hours</i>.

State Department says no meet-and-greet,
no shopping, no <i>Lion King</i>.

He leaves your podium,
his plane has two hours to clear US airspace,

unless the UN cancels the visit

and Tobin and I can get back
to the important work we were doing.

That's up to the GA President.
We just present a threat assessment.

Why is he coming?
To make a speech.

To escape the International Criminal Court.

Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

so he'll come,
talk about free elections and reform

and pray that that appeases everyone.

So the stakes are high.
He's not going to cancel.

Tell me about the interpreter.

Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

She studied music in Johannesburg

and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

Parents?

<i>British mother, white African father</i>.
<i>Moved here five years ago</i>.

Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

She is the UN.
Can she cook?

What else do we know?
Since the initial clearance.

Is she married?

<i>Does she have a child?</i>
<i>Does she belong to any clubs?</i>

Is she registered to vote?

<i>Democrat? Republican?</i>

<i>What religion is she?</i>

Who is she?

Silvia.

[They speak Spanish]

Secret Service Dignitary Protection Squad.

We're responsible for visiting heads of state.

I don't recall seeing you around.
They hire us for our forgettable faces.

Is she on guard?
Yes, ma'am.

Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?

I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

But you listen to voices.

Do you think you could identify the voice?

Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

Whispers disguise the quality of a voice.

You, I imagine, study faces.

You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
I know.

How'd you happen to be up there after hours?

We had an evacuation.
I'd left some things in the sound booth.

And there just happened to be some fellas
talking about an assassination

in a language that you and eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

Do you think I'm making it up?

Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?

People do.
I don't.

Some people like attention.
I don't.

You don't want Zuwanie here.
I didn't make it up.

How do you feel about him?
I don't care for him.

Wouldn't mind if he were dead?
If he were gone.

Same thing.
No, it isn't.

If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

Your profession is playing with words.
I don't play with words.

You're doing it now.
You are.

If I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have
reported it. It's not what I want.

That's not why I'm here.
Here?

Working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

You believe in diplomacy?
I believe in this place.

I believe in what it tries to accomplish.
Well, you've had a tough year, lady.

Listen.

I'm scared, and my protector
is someone who doesn't believe me.

You don't look scared.

People handle fear in different ways, Mr Keller.

It turns some people into stand-up comedians.
You don't know me at all.

Maybe I should see about assigning someone
to look after me who's better suited to the job.

I don't look after you,

I look after the man who's been
threatened, if there was a threat.

My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?

No, ma'am.

And we were getting along so well.

So what do you think?
She's a liar.

Agent Keller? Morning.
Special Agent Lewis, FBI. This is Agent King.

We're on loan.

So they have to be returned
in the same condition, or no refund.

Keller.
Woods.

Are you sure you're ready to come back?
I'm better working.

We got a credible threat?
We should assume so.

As popular as we are in the rest of the world,

the last thing we need is to have
a foreign leader get popped here,

particularly a guy like this that we don't like.

So State wants you to know, NSA, CIA, FBI,

whatever you need to keep this maniac's
heart beating till he gets out, it's yours.

<i>He's white. He was a Dutch mercenary</i>.
<i>He'll still have to wait</i>.

that Zuwanie was once a good man.

That's not unusual for these guys.

They begin as liberators. 20 minutes later,
they're as corrupt as the tyrants they topple.

He liberated the country from one of
the most corrupt governments on earth,

gave the people hope, and was a hero.
They need another name for what he is now.

Man likes his gun.
He'll have it with him.

He knows he won't be scanned.

Who are his enemies?

Aside from the thousands of victims' relatives?
These two.

Both his opponents, both want his job.

On the right, Ajene Xola.

Son of a doctor, Paris-educated,
pacifist to begin with.

Aren't they all?
He managed longer than most.

And the other?
He has two names, he's always in the <i>Post</i>.

One name, twice. Kuman-Kuman.

He's been yelling about Zuwanie being
a madman and the UN not doing enough.

He's in exile in Brooklyn.

A socialist and a capitalist,
both gaining strength with the people,

both with the motivation to see Zuwanie gone.

Gone?
Dead.

But not just dead.

Dead in front of the delegates of 191 countries
and every news service with a camera.

In front of the world.
Nobody needs to be that dead.

In my opinion,
we're wasting tax dollars staying late.

It's a con.

This is the interpreter?
I need everything CIA has on her.

<i>[Phone ringing]</i>

<i>[Answer machine: male French voice]</i>

[Speaks French]

<i>[Lud] So what do we make of this interpreter?</i>

<i>Is she making it up? Is she imagining things?</i>

I'm looking for Mr Lud.

Is she pretty?
I brought you a copy of her UN file.

Dr Zuwanie won't cancel his speech,
you know.

That's up to the GA President,
but you might want to think about it.

Ms Broome has a Matoban passport.
Excuse me?

She was born here, she was raised there,
so she has dual citizenship.

Are you serious?

Black or white?

No, thank you.

Is she black or white?
White.

<i>[Lud] Did you give her a polygraph test?</i>
<i>[Tobin] Not yet, no</i>.

<i>Well, shouldn't you?</i>

<i>[Cell phone]</i>

Hi, Ma.

Back off, you're too close. Way too close.
What are you, on a date?

<i>Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out</i>

<i>[Female voice] Hey, you there?</i>

<i>Maybe I made a mistake</i>.

<i>Are you there?</i>

<i>I told him I want to come back</i>.

They're ready for you.

I'll be right there.

I'll be right there.
OK.

Ms Broome.

Can I get you anything?
How about a hood?

I want to split that.
When do I know the results?

Right away.
You know when you're lying, don't you?

Look straight ahead, feet flat on the floor.

Is your name Silvia Broome?

Miss Broome?

I found out something from our domestic Intel.

All this may have begun with a tragic accident.

What do you mean?
Her parents farmed in the mountains.

This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

and Dr Zuwanie was forced to mine the roads.

Her parents were bringing her younger sister
back from school and hit a mine.

And they were killed?
All of them.

How old was she?
12, 13.

Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

She has every reason
to want Dr Zuwanie tried at the ICC.

I'll be right back.

Oh, no. Come on.
OK, the control questions show stress,

and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

We should just read her palm.

How did I do?
<i>Je ne sais pas</i>.

Nils Lud. Dr Zuwanie's head of security.

I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood, I might ask a few.

Might I ask where you stand now
politically, Miss Broome?

I'm for peace and quiet, Mr Lud.
It's why I came to the UN. Quiet diplomacy.

With respect, you only interpret.

Countries have gone to war
after misinterpreting one another.

I would say she's clearly under stress,
but not necessarily lying.

Congratulations.

I'm told what you heard was a whisper.
Yes.

Is it possible you could identify it
if you ever heard it again?

It might be.

Tell me, do you have a brother?

I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please? Thank you.

Does this mean the test was...?
The test was inconclusive.

But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

Next time you want to question an
American citizen here, you ask permission.

Silvia.
Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

Did you do something naughty?
A couple of FBls were asking me about you.

If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

What'd you tell them?
I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

you're perfect.

I need somebody on the guy with two names.

Mo.
It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

You volunteering, or just correcting me?

I'm from Brooklyn.
You got him. You and...?

I was on him when he first came here.
OK, you got him again.

I thought she had perfect pitch.

She says whispers
don't have a recognisable pitch.

NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

They don't know that.
They say they do.

No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

Why not let them keep thinking she can ID it?

What are you asking me to do, Jay?
I don't want her to be harmed.

In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her.
We got three days. She's your only link.

Are we using her as bait?

Just make the calls.

I'm sending you an attachment.
Can you print front and back?

I've asked INS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

<i>Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo</i>.
<i>I'll do voice samples on everyone</i>.

So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

She said it was a whisper.
Well, now she thinks she can do it.

Photo there yet?
It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

Look at the crowd.

<i>Look closely</i>.

Any leads?

Maybe one.

Come on down to Mexico.

Is that you?

Tell me what someone like you

who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

is doing at a rebel rally?

A peace rally.
I don't want to do this again.

That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

After that. After you listen.

You're asking the wrong question.
It's one you don't want to answer.

Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?

This is a death list.

The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why?"

What are you not saying?
What are you accusing me of?

How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "I don't care for him"?

I feel disappointment.

That's a lover's word.

What about rage?

Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

It was his land-mines that killed your...
Sh!

We don't name the dead.

Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

on God if they can't find anyone else.

But in Africa,

in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

If someone is murdered,

a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

or they can save him.

The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

they'll have justice
but spend the rest of their lives in mourning.

But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

...that very act can take away their sorrow.

Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

Why do you look away?

There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

But not when you do it.

I'm not the one under investigation.

That was a long time ago.

<i>FBI</i>.

Shall we take a walk?

[She plays haunting melodic tune]

How close can a vehicle get over here?
Not close enough.

No garage under the GA.
Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

It has to be a rifle.
From where?

How does he get a rifle in?

Could be from up close.
Who gets that close?

One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

It's already here.

If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

No, he missed it.
Some lady called 911, saw the guy.

Go easy on him, OK? He feels terrible.

On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

I couldn't see the fire escape.

You mean you screwed up.

I mean I screwed up.
So did I.

I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

You OK?
Great.

No one.

You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?
No.

No one else has a key...
Nobody.

The door wasn't forced.
They can't pick locks?

They can, we can tell. They didn't.

Where do you keep your key?
My purse.

It hasn't been out of your sight all day?
No.

Yes.

In my locker.

Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

That's about it, yeah.

[Something falls]

Dot?

Is there anything special about this mask?

I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

My brother gave it to me.

I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?

He's more into lists.

Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

I read. My brother kept lists.

Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

odd animal facts.

Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?

Yes.
You did not.

He had a notebook for words that he liked.

Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

Could he be involved in this?

We're stuck, aren't we? You and I?

We're <i>kepéla</i>.

It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

Give me a reason to get to the other side.

[Speaking Ku]

[Muffled cries]

Just wait a second.

OK.

There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

And then?

We'll figure something out.

Thank you.

My wife was killed two weeks ago.

She... she'd left me.

She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

She was going to come back this time.

She said.

She was a dancer.

The guy was a dancer, too.

Eddie.

Great dancer.

Lousy driver.

The only way he knew how to stop a car

was to slam it
into a bridge abutment in Santa Fe.

So there was no taking her back this time.

The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

...I think I would have let him drown.

I might have even
held his head under the water.

Not a very Ku thing to do.

If you need anything, you can call the precinct
or just go downstairs.

This is my cell number.

It's the same card.

Goodnight.

Lock this.

It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

I'll do first shift.
Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?

Lewis and King. He'll be in bed soon.

FBI's right.
Guy does the same routine every day.

Call me if she gets
another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

Sweet dreams, partner.

Can't what?

ID the voice. She thought she could, now

She can't because she can't, or because

No, listen.

Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

What happened?
So I arrange it.

But it was a trap.

Xola's dead.

I knew it.

I knew he was dead.

Was my brother there?

No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

I stayed in the car. No one came back out.

Where is he? Where's my brother?
I don't know.

You think Kuman has him?
I don't know what to think.

Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell.
How did it get to be like this?

You see what I did? I took Xola right to them.

You didn't know.
Forgive me.

I was only trying to help.
There's nothing to forgive.

Yes, there is.

I have to go.
Philippe.

<i>[Click of camera]</i>

You cannot do that. How the hell do I
protect you if I don't know where you are?

You emphatically told me that you weren't.

That was before you had a man in a mask
on your fire escape.

I've had a 24-hour shift of agents
across the street.

Who was that in the park?

It's personal.
We're past that. What's his name?

It's not your business.

Is he the one you e-mailed
before reporting the threat?

"Where are you?
I'm worried about you. Write me."

"Please. I need to know you're OK"?

Worried why? Because he's involved?

Is that him, here, now, in my country,
making threats? That is my business.

You're wrong. It's got nothing to do with you.

<i>[Simon's voice] I'll take care of you</i>.

I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?
Just what I need, another night without sleep.

I'm good. Thanks.

What's up with Common Kuman?

Brushing his teeth.
I gotta talk to him.

Café Atlantic, noon to two, then
the Nava Club for a steam and massage.

Coffee?
No, I'm good, thanks.

She can't sleep either. Just turned the TV on.

Probably PBS.

Where you going?
You're here with your bag.

I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

Unless you want me to stay.

No. Thanks.

Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Keller.
<i>[Silvia] I'm sorry</i>.

I really didn't know you were watching me...

...<i>or I wouldn't have just</i>...<i>left like that</i>.

You want to tell me what happened?
<i>I had to meet someone</i>.

Philippe Broullet.
If you knew, why did you ask?

I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

He needed to talk to me.
Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

What did he say?
How do you know I'm...?

Are you over there?

Jesus.

He told me we lost a friend.

He lost a friend.
I... lost someone I loved once.

It was a long time ago.

You can't sleep either.

I don't know why I'm calling you.

What do you do when you can't sleep?
I stay awake.

You don't name the dead, you said. Why?

What... what happens?

You move past them. You leave them behind.

You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

To move on.

You've been going through hell.

Keeping busy.

You, too, I think. I don't know all of it, but...

Are you going to be there until morning?

It almost is morning.

Yeah, I'll be here.

Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?

That's fine.

Goodnight.

<i>She's coming your way</i>.

Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

Yes. Thank you, God.

You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

Bring him to me.
Can't. He didn't show up for work.

Sit on his apartment.
Doug's there.

Hey. Got the INS files.

This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
You can let me off up here.

<i>She's at the corner of Bergen</i>
<i>and Nostrand in Brooklyn</i>.

She's where?
My guy's on the move.

<i>She's here, whether I brought her or not</i>.

Go back. What's she doing?
<i>Waiting for something</i>.

Holy shit.
What?

The janitor. Jad Jamal.

That's not him.
I know. That's his room-mate.

Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

Should I stay here?
No, you stick with the room-mate.

Are we working on a warrant?
Lewis is.

How are you?
I got something for you.

OK, bless you.

Tobin?

What's up?
I don't know, but it don't feel good.

What are they doing?
Just standing there.

<i>We're getting on the el</i>.

[Speaks Ku]

Shit.
She just got on the bus with Kuman.
