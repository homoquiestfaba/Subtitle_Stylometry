I'm Stanley tucci,
your host of <i>independent lens.</i>

Have you heard of Wayne white,

a new darling
of the fine art world?

It's called
<i>Picasso's ass falling off.</i>


I know--
not what you were expecting.

Wayne's not only redefining
what it means to be an artist.

He's redefining art.

He's a creative visionary

who put the "play"
in <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

He survived
the indignities of Hollywood

and the pretensions
of the art world

by following
two guiding principles:

Life can be art,
and art can be funny.

Independent filmmaker
Neil Berkeley

catches up with Wayne
as he reflects

on his unpredictable career,

from his rebellious beginnings

to the trenches
of commercial television

to his surprising triumph
as a fine art star.

How many of us are willing
to do what it takes

to follow our dreams?

Let's face it.

The world needs more people
like this modern-day dali

with a banjo.

<i>Beauty is embarrassing</i> next.

[Cheers and applause]

Hi, everybody.

My name is Wayne white,
and I make pictures,

like this one.

It's called
<i>Picasso's ass falling off.</i>


This is called
<i>[Bleep] you invasion.</i>


Oh, man.

This humble room is my studio.

For the last 12 years,

this is where I've done
just about everything.

These are drawings
from the first season

of <i>pee-wee's playhouse,</i>
wallpaper designs.

This was
right by the front door.

I designed most of the puppets
on the show.

This is cool cat.

And here's my man dirty dog.

"Hey, pee-wee, what do you say?

I'm smokin' cigarettes
nearly every day."

I wanted him to have this butt
hanging out of his mouth,

but they wouldn't let us.

It's a kids' show.

But the first time I thought
I was an artist was, like--

man,
I was a little kid.

I always thought
I was an artist.

And if you don't like it,

Here I go
with the "[Bleep] you"s again.

I got to stop that.

You're gonna have me saying

all these "[Bleep] you"s
on camera.

I'm gonna look like
a real bitter ass[Bleep].

This is a prop from
the smashing pumpkins' video

<i>tonight, tonight.</i>

This is the spaceship
that they go to the moon on.

This is the--whoa.

Word painting:
<i>[Bleep] a.</i>

Cheerios sculpture:
<i>F.U. Shack.</i>

Palm tree frond that looks
like a woman's crotch.

This is Peter Gabriel,
<i>big time</i> video from '87.

This thing
is in a very fragile state now.

It's been a long, wild ride
for me.

You know, everybody's like,
"choose one thing,

"and do it well,
my son.

Now go."

And I was like,
"[Bleep] That," you know?

I want to try everything I can,
you know?

I want to take
this painting idea

and see if you can do
a puppet version of it.

I want to take the cartooning
and turn it into a set.

I want to take the set

and turn it
back into a painting.

That's a true pioneer.

That's a true person
who is never satisfied,

always wants to know,
"what's the next thing?

How do I understand myself
or the universe more?"

He's a hardworking
mother[Bleep].

He's got, like,
Southern work ethic

ground into him hard.

Now everyone will know
of my sufferings.

This is what happens

when you get all proud
of yourself

and you're polishing your emmy.

[Makes squeaking noise]

Oh, my emmy.

Oh.

Oh, I need a new emmy.

They gave me one.

I can't throw anything away.

Every piece of wood I cut
is an interesting shape to me.

I just--I immediately fall
in love with scraps and junk.

This is what makes me happy,
a pile of garbage.

Oh, I've worn
a lot of different hats:

Painter, sculptor,
cartoonist, puppeteer,

set designer, art director,
animator, illustrator.

Who did that?
And wait a minute.

That's the same guy
that did that,

and that's the same guy
that did that?

[Barking]

I mean, Wayne's stuff,
kids mainlined.

He was just imprinting
their brain,

and they don't even know it.

Hey, get that gol' durn camera
off me.

Can't you see I'm trying
to take a leak?

Go on. Get.

There's a little, you know,
Zach galifianakis,

a little snuffy Smith,
a little unabomber.

Yeah.

Wayne is one of those artists
that has touched people

in ways that they don't
even know.

We're very, very lucky
to have him today

to present for us,

so please join me
in giving Wayne white

a very warm welcome.


And sometimes
I make big pictures,

like these big words
I put on the side

of the wolfsonian museum
in Miami beach

for art basel 2009.

It says,
"beauty is embarrassing."

Now, what do I mean by that,
"beauty is embarrassing"?

Hmm.

Tell you what.
I'll tell you later.

[Bluesy guitar music]

d d

[Machine whirring]

Thank you.

Mmm, very nice.

I know why Wayne makes art.

Because he has to.


I think that's what it
comes down to, really,

for any artist
is, it's a compulsion.

You have to.

You can't not do it.

Well, Mimi is my most
important ally in the world.

She is the number one
unconditional supporter of me.

I hate the beard.

d Mm-mm-mm d

We got two beautiful kids,
woodrow and Lulu,

and they're both artists too.

May God have mercy
on their souls.

They're very talented,
both of them.

They both got it going on.

When you're an artist
in a house of artists,

it's hard to stand out.

I try not to give advice.

But you know
what my only advice is?

What?

I would put in
the big areas first.

That's all.

I mean, it's interesting
to work from detail to large,

like you do,
I guess.

I'm not gonna say nothing.
You already did.

What about your composition,
though?

You make sure
you got enough room

for the green, right?

Yeah.

Yeah,
I want to be like my dad.


Here's a drawing Woody did
when he was about two years old.

He started drawing
really early.

He just developed
really quick.

These are the ones I just drew
beside you as you were drawing.

I was getting this real burst
of energy

just working with him.

Our family as a unit
has the identify of, like,

we're all in this together.

You know, we all know
what it feels like

being an artist
in this society.

Yeah?

It's a good one.

These are
the thrift store paintings

the way they are
when I find them, of course.

And then I do my thing,

and they wind up like this.

This one says,
"eastern [Bleep] it."

The very first time
I showed Wayne's work,

people just really didn't know
what to think,

because they just
started laughing

at some of these phrases
that were on the wall.

The thing about Wayne is,
he's really funny.

His ideas are really smart.

I think humor is sacred.

I really do,
and it's my sacred mission.

I think humor is the most
important thing we have

as human beings.

It's thought as a lesser thing,

but it's really
our most sacred quality,

and without it,
we're dead.

Here's my tribute
to television comedy writing:

<i>[Bleep] Jokes</i>
<i>from sherman oaks.</i>


There is a pressure
to keep things fresh, yeah,

not to fall into a rut
and just be a one-trick pony,

which a lot of people
think I am, because, you know,

my trademark
is those word paintings,

and they think
that's all I can do,

and they kind of sniff at them.

"Oh, yes.

It's just a cheap trick,"
you know, "blah, blah, blah."

There's a million gripes
for the artist to dwell on.

It's hard.

You have your doubts constantly.

The first time I saw his work,
it made me laugh.

I thought it was a howl

but it's too easy,

and I didn't think about it
much longer than that.

The first time I saw them,

I didn't really understand
what I was looking at.

At first, it was sort of
a head-scratcher,

like, "well, you didn't paint
that whole thing.

You just painted those letters,"
you know.

You know,
with his work,

it can be easily construed
as a gimmick.

The surface of it
seems to appear to be novelty.

That says, "high & tight."

That says,
"[Bleep] Hounds on parade."

I'll settle for laughter
any day.

Laughter is a deep thing.

Most people don't think it is,
but it is.

You know, in the art world,
funny isn't taken seriously.

People want more
than just a joke.

There's two beer cans
right here.

The guys who built this,

they had to stay there
all night.

"Entertainment" is a dirty word
in the art world.

You're not supposed
to entertain people.

You're supposed to question
their core values

and make them reevaluate
their lives

and give them a deep insight
into blah, blah, blah,

blah, blah, blah, [Bleep] Blah.

There is insecurity
in the art world

that real pleasure
or that what we call fun

is not serious, you know,
that it's not intellectual.

You know,
everybody looks down on comedy,

the oscars and, you know,
my mom, you know, everybody.

This is the ditch-digging
part of art.

A lot of art is ditch digging.

Most people
want things to be easy.

It's never easy.

Nobody would give me reviews
here in L.A.

I would go out of town
and get all this notice,

but people in L.A.
were slow to notice me.

One of my first thoughts
was, like,

"wow, these are really funky
updates of ed ruscha,

and he's kind of
the L.A. word master.

Well, L.A. has this big
hang-up about ed ruscha.

You know, everybody wants
to compare me

to ed [Bleep] ruscha
all the time.

Ruscha is kind of
a giant oak tree,

and when I saw Wayne's work,
my first thought was, like,

"oh, this is a young kid
who loves ruscha

and is doing something with it.

And so anytime you get near
the sacred cow of him,

you know, it's like,
"[Bleep] You.

"Back off.

Ed's our man,
and you're just an imitator."

There it is
a couple of days later.

"Hoozy thinky iz?"

[Laughs]

Made it, ma,
cover of the <i>Nashville scene.</i>

Hey, we should do lbj.

[Laughs] Lbj.
Yeah, that's a good one.

Let's do it.

He's on my mind.

Now that I've got a reputation
in the art world,

it's time to show some new sides
that I can do.

He's kind of crossing over
from youth

into the classic lbj face
from the '60s.

His head is pretty squarish.

I think a lot of people
just think of me

as the thrift store word guy.

I think that's getting
at his essence, don't you?

Yeah.

I'm just kind of
letting my hair down, I think,

and just doing
exactly what I want to do.

Hey, y'all,
wait a minute, now.

Ahh!

Makes no sense, you know,
as far as, like, a career.

I'm lyndon Johnson.

I want your vote
for the congress of Texas.

They didn't seem too excited.

See?
That's what I get at home.

They're so sick of me now.

"Oh,
another thing he did."

Regardless of all that,
I just want to do it

for myself.

It'll be totally different
than what anything

anybody is really doing
in L.A. right now,

and it'll be a side of me
that they haven't seen and...

I'm just as insecure
as anybody in a lot of ways.

Everybody's insecure.

But there has to be this
other kind of faith in yourself,

and I always take
this big cosmic view.

Man, you're only gonna be alive,
if you're lucky,

80, 90 years,
and then that's it.

That's all you get.

So why not?

What does it [Bleep] matter?

I can do anything I want to do,
you know?


Let's go.
Time's running out.

[Birds chirping]

[Upbeat twangy guitar music]

Where does it all start?

Well, I'll tell you
where it all starts.

It all starts for me
in north Alabama

in a place
called sand Mountain.

Technically
where my mama and daddy are from

was where the word "hillbilly"
was first coined,

so if I can't use it,
I don't know who could.


[Dog barks]

Shut up.

This is my favorite part
of Tennessee right here.

It's beautiful out here.

It's so beautiful,
it hurts my feelings.

This is my ideal.

It's why I'm attracted
to landscape in the first place.

I'm trying to kind of
get a piece of this in my art.

[Chickens clucking]

It's funny too,
'cause when I left the South,

I became the southerner.

"I'm from the South,
everybody.

"Yeah, that's me,
from the South.

"Remember me: Wayne, South,
Wayne, South.

Get it."

I never knew I was so Southern
until I left.

Willis white.

Billie June white.

I'm his father.

And I'm his mother.

Wayne is different.

He's--he's a different child.

It's just exceptional
what kind of talent he has.

We're so,
so proud of him.

He always wanted to draw.

That's about all he ever wanted
to do.

Wayne was drawing
before he could sit along good.

You wouldn't believe it.

It was just fabulous
the way that child did.

We'd buy him
big old thick tablets,

and he'd just sit down
and just draw

till he drew up all the pages.

Then he'd turn over
and draw the other side.

My earliest memories
are of drawing

or of people watching me draw

or people reacting
to my drawings.

I guess that's why I look at art
as entertainment,

because I always used it
to entertain myself.

So, you know,
I always talk about you

being an influence on me.

Me?

I'm a freak on decorating.

I love to decorate.

Can't get enough.

This is her latest creation:
The hope wall.

I like this,
these stars and the letters.

And see, that's hoping
my grandchildren will be--

that's hoping
that they'll turn out good.

Then there's the risque humor.

"We do not serve women.

You must bring your own."

You know, yeah.

Here's a frightening clown
that lives in the corner.

He's offering children drugs,
as you can see.

A little pinch of this,
children.

Yes,
he's a good guy.

Mimi, my wife,
pointed out that my mama's house

was definitely a direct link
to <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

The minute she pointed it out,
it was obvious.

Here's my big grade,
first grade,

and that's miss stoddard,

who I was in love with.

She was only probably
about 23, 24 years old,

and she's the one who got me
in front of the class

and told everybody I was
gonna be an artist one day.

She said, "have you all
noticed how Wayne draws?"

And we said, "well, yeah,

but we didn't think
anything about it."

And she was just amazed
about it.

Mama was the first artist,
and I was their first son.

And my sister,
she was the first badass.


Oh, she was the one that
told me I was gonna die one day

and made sure I was clear
on the concept.


As a little boy,
he liked to play soldiers,

and he had a big imagination.

He always had imaginary friends
that he would talk to.

And he spent a lot of time
just walking around

talking to them,

and I just remember him
being very playful,

and he got a little crotchety
as he grew older,

but he was a fun little boy.

[Ominous music]

d d

We had a very,
very severe car wreck

when Wayne was growing up.

We were going down to Alabama
for Thanksgiving.

These hillbillies, like,
pkew, head-on.

They were just right
in our face before we saw them.

We was on their side of the road

right in the middle
of that curb, hit us head-on.

Didn't have seat belts
in the cars then.

After that happened,
it was rough.

It was not so good.

I had a brain injury,

and I haven't
gotten over it yet.

She was in the intensive care
for, I'd say, over two months.

You were a little slow
with everything.

Your reactions
wasn't what they used to be.

And I wasn't able to walk,
talk, or do anything.

I mean,
it's the worst nightmare,

something like that.

It was like--

it just ripped me
out of my childhood.

I'm still
sort of sorting it out,

what it meant to me.

Together
we rarely talked about it,

but I'm sure it had to impact

the way he made art
and the way he saw the world.

I got a real harsh taste

of how horrible
the world could be.

So maybe that did drive me
further into a fantasy thing.

I couldn't have made it
without Willis.

I...I just--
I don't know.

He was just my rock.

He took care
of the children.

He had the children
to take care of,

get them off to school.

I do realize
he made a lot of sacrifices,

and it was really hard on him.

I think that really

put the clamp down on him
emotionally.

I don't think he was ever
the same after that either.

In matter, don't know
what I would have done

without him.

He was, like,
this golden God to me.

He was my hero.

He was, like, you know,
the star athlete.

Any game he played,

he was nearly always
the standout,

and everybody really loved him,
and, you know,

they called him Willie.

[Bluesy guitar music]

d d

When I was growing up
in the country,

there wasn't nothing to do
but sports.

And I played football.

Then after football,

I'd go right into basketball.

At the end of basketball,

I'd play baseball
till school was out.

Then we'd have teams
in the summer

and played baseball all summer.

He's got a champion mentality.

You know, he's the senior
bowling champion of Tennessee,

but he's still competing hard
and still going for the gold,

you know?

He's not a fist-pumping
kind of guy.

I got them scared now.

They're falling
before I get up there.

He spent a lot of time
in a bowling alley

to not turn out
to be a bowler.

I guess he got sick of it.

I just thought it was a natural
thing for a boy to want to do,

you know,
but he didn't really want to.

To sort of give up on it
on my part

was kind of to give up
on a bond with him, yeah.

The only place I was going
was three or four nights a week

to the bowling alley
with my daddy,

and, of course,
I had to sit there.

I couldn't run around.

So I brought me a big old stack
of notebook paper and pencils,

and I drew.

[Laughs]
I guess.

Yes.
Whoo.

This is the Southern daddy
shame ray redneck puppet.

At least since adolescence,

I've been sort of reacting
against things,

and coming from the South,
I reacted against the South

and its string
of authority figures.

He's the--you know,
he's the good classic Southern

authority figure type guy
from my childhood,

a certain type of man
that's sort of fading away.

You look like a woman
with that hair.

That is the shame ray

that different Southern
authority figures can give you.

I have known guys like that.

My father
is an excellent example,

Wayne's father even more so

because of his silence
and his stoic quality.

I got to mow that yard.

I got my beans coming in,
my "'maters."

Somebody standing here
saying he's got to paint me.


That's him, all right.

When I was hitting puberty,
I would go out way deep,

deep, deep, deep in the woods
and strip naked

and run around.


Sometimes the dogs
would follow me out there.

The dogs would be,
"ooh, boy."

They loved it.

"He's naked like us.
Let's go."

And I'd be out there
with the dogs howling

and sniffing around.

Just--I was compelled to do it.

You know,
it was a complete

sap-rising urge.

Growing up
in hixson, Tennessee,

you could live
your entire life there

and never look at a work of art.

Art was something
that you bought at K-Mart.

My mother got her art
at K-Mart.

I used to--I remember one day
going with her

to buy a painting at K-Mart

which hung in our house
for many years,

and then when we moved,

it didn't fit the wall
very well,

so she threw it away,
threw it in the trash.

That's art.

[Upbeat bluesy rock music]

d d

Most of everything
that he did and learned

was--probably a lot of that
was self-taught.

I mean,
there wasn't a lot of influence

in that little town.

I think artists
in that community

had been seen as curious,

and I think the better
the artist was,

the more curious they became.

I really couldn't talk
to him about art, I don't guess,

because I didn't understand it
that much,

but we didn't really know
how to relate to him about it,

I don't guess.

So my high school teacher,

the one time he did try
to directly kind of help me,

I'd done these
Salvador dali drawings.

He showed them to my principal,
b.E. Edwards,

this real old-school
Southern hard-ass.

He sits me down,
and he goes,

"your art teacher gave me
some of your drawings you did,"

and he pulls the surrealist
drawings out, and he goes,

"those do not look like
the drawings

of a red-blooded American boy."

I was full-time on rebellious
for three years solid,

10th through 12th.

I mean,
that was my full-time job.

I disgusted him with my hair
and my art.

It was hard sometimes,

because he did get
into some big trouble.

He got arrested a couple times.

What was that bad thing
you got into, Wayne?

What was that?

I stole that mailbox that time
and got arrested.

Oh, yeah.

All the Southern daddy
shame rays in my life

were disgusted.

There was a lot of disgust
going on back then.

I mean, literally.

It was just like, "ugh."

They just, "ugh."

But then it turned
into defiance.

"Oh, yeah?

"I'm glad I'm disgusting you.

you know?

Just the defiance grew
and grew and grew.

I was dying to get out.

I was dying to, like, yeah,
get away from that whole place.

d Happy Birthday,
Mr. president d

These are, like,
junk sculpture marionettes

made out of found objects,

mostly, like,
sticks and a hammer

and a coconut shell.

Kind of looks like
Michelle pfeiffer.

Odd cutout pieces of junk
that I had laying around:

Pencils, styrofoam, wire.

I love sticks.

I'm always finding them
on the ground

and picking them up
and playing with them.

So this just kind of, like,
was a spontaneous application

of my stick collection.

I started making these
just out of the blue.

I wasn't quite sure
what I was doing.

I really love making them.

That's all I know right now.

Hee, heh-heh, heh-heh.

Right in the middle of the '70s,

I enrolled at middle Tennessee
state university...

Where I pursued my education
in braless hippie chicks.


This place changed my life
completely.

It was my first time
away from home.

It was my first exposure
to art and culture.

So this is where the barn was,
and it was two big roofs

and the two
big giant silos over here.

And right here
was the painting studio.

And this is where I worked a lot
right here.

d Ya-LA-LA d

Only imagine me up in the air,
because it was the second floor.

It was very much the era
of the country hippie

when I arrived here in '75.

And we did
a lot of party stuff,

you know,
that kids may do in college

that don't have better sense.

God, we did so many
crazy things together.

So this was my first band
of artists.

Did you say you're some kind
of artist, I hear you say?

We're the people that are tired
of being pushed around.

Whether we were making
snowy monuments to doggy love

or painting crazy cars,

I learned that art could be
a 24-7 lifestyle.

I learned that art
could be fun.

It could be a big part
of your life that never stopped.

No holds barred,
and if you got an idea

to do some crazy performance,
you just did it.

My name is scary Bobby.

We really lived it.

We really did,
because it was fun.

We had finally found
fellow weirdos

that shared our enthusiasm.

We were all, like,
small-town kids

that finally found
kindred spirits.

What's the world like,
mama?

We were just goofing around,
having fun.

This was--this is
a very important place for me.

It's so nice
to finally meet you.

It's nice to meet you.

I've heard a lot about you,
and, of course,

I've enjoyed your work.

We used to watch
<i>pee-wee's playhouse</i>

every Saturday morning.

He's the voice of the pig...
Oh, my goodness.

The pet pig.
Yeah, yeah.

Vance, wasn't it?

Vance the pig.

I enjoy your art too.

I mean,
that's just fantastic.

I love what you do.

Thanks.
That's really cool.

Thanks.

My prediction:
It's gonna be enchantment.

There's gonna be
a magical carpet ride

to another time and place.

There's gonna be
the fulfillment of fantasies

all over chattanooga tonight,
and I'm gonna be doing that.

I'm gonna inspire
and amuse

in that order.

Hi.
Excuse me.

Could I have you sign this
for me, please?

Sure.

Here we go.
Thanks, David.

To anybody?

I would like you to do it
"to Sandra stoddard,

my first grade teacher."

Oh, my God.


How are you?
Holy smokes.

"To Mrs. stoddard, thank you
for starting all of this!

Love, Wayne."

But as I told him,
that isn't true.

He has a God-given talent,

and it was quite evident
at the very beginning of school,

so he's lived up
to my prediction.

The incomparable hixson boy,
Wayne white.

[Cheers and applause]

Thanks for coming,
everybody.

Right off the bat,
I want to introduce you

to some names I recognize:

My mama and daddy,
Willis and Billie...

[Cheers and applause]

And my first grade teacher,
Sandra stoddard, right here.

[Cheers and applause]

In the fall of 1980,

I packed my 1970
light green Ford Maverick,

and I moved to New York City,
and let me tell you,

if there was ever
a culture shock,

it's a boy from chattanooga
moving to Manhattan

and living above
the pink pussycat boutique

on west 4th street.

[Upbeat banjo music]

d when I was young
and in my prime d

d I left my home in Caroline d

My daddy, he gets a little
teared up at these things,

which always surprised me,
because my whole life,

he's been, like...
Under wraps.

d I've got those
blue Ridge Mountain blues d

And as he gets older,

some of masks start coming off,
you know?

d My bag is packed for travel d

Even though they didn't quite
understand me growing up,

they did the best they could.

I didn't want to be understood,
to tell you the truth.

d No work,
no worries anymore d

d I've got those
blue Ridge Mountain blues d

It makes me realize

that it's just his style
to be who he is,

and he does the best he can.

Bye. Good night, y'all.
Thanks for coming.

Love you.

Love you too.
Thanks, daddy.

Well, we'll see y'all
in the morning.

All right, thanks for coming.

That's a sad song.

Early on,
New York was tough.

I had some work
in <i>high times</i> magazine,

but mostly it was just hustling,
handing out xeroxed comics

and trying to make a name
for myself.

Get your free comics.

I was about to pack it all up
and head back to Tennessee

when I remembered I was supposed
to put on a puppet show.

It was called "rootless,"
and it was at this art gallery

called small walls.

So I go to the gallery,

and my girlfriend at the time
didn't show up,

but Mimi did.

I was feeling pretty cynical
about dating.

Plus, I was really focused
on my career.

Yeah, Mimi was a star
in the comics world,

way more successful
than I was.

So my friend asked if I wanted
to go to a puppet show,

and I said,
"yeah, right.

"Maybe I'll meet someone.

Hah!

Then after the show,
this skinny guy pops up

from behind the stage,
and I thought,

"that's what I want!"

Oh, man,

she had me from the start.

Here was this cute
comic book star,

and she liked me!

I couldn't believe it.

Plus,
she had her [Bleep] together.

She had work,
and she had lots of stuff.

Yeah, I had nice things,
and I could cook,

so I lured him into my lair.

She had a color TV
and a vcr!

Oh, man,
I was in heaven!

Come.

Come enjoy hot cooked meals,
television,

and a real bed!

I was in high cotton,
I'll tell ya,

all that and a brilliant artist
for a girlfriend.

What more could you want?

And here we are
27 years later.

The invention
and the originality

and the freshness
and the energy of it

really dazzled me,
and I was looking--

that's really
what I was looking for

was, like,
someone to dazzle me.

I could see right away
that he had incredible talent.

And, of course,
I am a sucker for talent myself.

She had already created
the famous

<i>valley girls' guide to life</i>

and launched a whole
cultural phenomena with that.

She was making all the money,
and I wasn't making any money.

We moved in almost right away,
which was a first for me.

I had never lived
with any boyfriend before that.

It didn't look good,

and my friends teased me
about it that I was, like,

sponging off another woman
and stuff,

and I had to prove to everybody
that I could pull my own weight

and was worthy
of her attentions.

It was just
one of those things

where, you know,
we just knew.

We feel in love.

We had so much fun together.

That was
the big turning point there.

I decided I was gonna stay.

[Wailing rock guitar music]

d d

Well, what was happening
back then

was the east village scene.

You'd see Andy warhol
almost every day.

d d

Jean-Michel basquiat.

That's when graffiti started,
around the early '80s.

There was a whole world
of underground cartoonists

and cartoonists in general
in New York.

The world's first abstract
expressionist comic book.

By the time I was
to the last page,

I knew I had to be a part
of this world.

The east village culture

was the "kicking
against mainstream" culture,

and we like music that sounds
irritating, dissonant.

Everything had a sharper vibe,

and everything
looked like ruins,

a bombed-out Berlin.

It was a big visual explosion.

Music videos
just had started.

Visually
it was quite exciting.

Hello.
It's me, pee-wee Herman.

For the next 60 seconds,
mtv will conduct a test

of its own
emergency comedy system.

The sound you hear
is just a test.

Please stand by.

Ahhhhh....

Ahh-ahhh-ha.

I remember walking in.

It was a giant beehive
of a room.

Everybody's working on
crazy puppet heads and models,

and models are hanging
from the ceiling,

and half-finished
miniature worlds are everywhere.

I mean,
it was classic.

You're just like,
"wow, this is amazing.

Wow, this is, like, fun land."

The minute I saw the scene,
I was like, "yeah, man.

"I got to get in on this.

This is my thing."

So I started in, like,
April of 1986,

and I interviewed every creative
and film person in New York

and probably 400 people,

and Wayne white had the
perfect sensibility for pee-wee.

I was like,
"oh, it's all coming together

"with those thing,
all these years

"of those stupid puppet shows
done at keg parties

"and galleries and my painting
and the cartooning.

It's all here.
It's all in there."

I went to work the next day.

Here's the visual granddaddies
of <i>pee-wee's playhouse:</i>

Gary panter, Rick heitzman,
and me.

They all were always
in their, like,

little journals and sketchbooks
sketching up a storm,

extremely prolific.

They weren't available
for socializing,

because they were working
day and night.

We just drew.

I mean, we all three
just loved to draw,

so it was just, like,
I mean, what could be better?

Make up stuff
that this wacky guy would live--

you know,
how he would live.

It was a dream job:
Sitting in a room smoking weed,

drawing funny pictures.

Oh,
it was the best.

Oh, I think, back then,
it was a big lovefest.

All those guys
were like the brothers

they all never had
or something.

I was put in charge
of the puppets,

stuff like floory
and dirty dog.

I didn't know [Bleep]
about building puppets.

You know,
I just did it my own crazy,

funky, homemade way.

Like, to build dirty dog,
I got an oven mitt

and just glued foam rubber
around the oven mitt.

And I carved Randy out
of a solid piece of white pine.

And his head
weighed about 15 pounds.

And it would keep turning around
on set, on camera.

It would start moving,
and it had a mind of its own.

It would go, like, <i>exorcist.</i>

It would go all the way
around...

"Cut.
What's wrong?"

It's like,
"I don't know what's wrong?"

I knew exac--
I knew what was wrong.

I didn't know what I was doing
is what was wrong.

Randy was made
a couple of times

or two or three times,
and Randy would fall apart.

Yeah, you got a block of pine
and a pocketknife?

You know, that was another
little lesson I learned.

Sometimes you've got
to make it up as you go along.

You know what I mean?

For what they were paying
and getting out of Wayne,

I thought,
"they look great."

Again, my m.O.:
On-the-job training.

You know, it was like,
"can you make the puppets?"

"Yeah, sure.

I can make puppets,
yeah."

And so one day, Paul is there,
and he's going, like,

"well, do you do voices?

Do you perform?"

I go, "yeah, I do my own
stupid puppet show stuff."

He goes, "okay, let's hear.
Let's..."

And that's where I auditioned
for the puppets.

And oddly enough,
I got the job,

and I became Randy.

Yeah, Randy.

Hey, remember the time I almost
set the playhouse on fire?

That was a close one.

And then I did dirty dog.

d Hey, everybody,
gather round d

d to hear a truly groovy
funky sound d

I was flower number three,
one of my feminine roles.

I harmonized with Rick
and Alison on that.

We were the three flowers
sitting there like ass[Bleep].

Presenting...

Presenting...

Presenting...

It was just, like,
the littlest voice.

His royal majesty...

All: The king of cartoons.

We'd sit there all day
doing that.

What a job.


That whole first season
was crazy.

It was a joke.

They rented an empty loft
in New York City

on the fifth floor.

We were literally
in a sweatshop.

The sewing machines
had just been thrown out.

There was no air-conditioning.

It didn't even have
the right amount of electricity.

It had never had a stage in it,
and plus,

every 15 feet,
there was a column.

All day long, we would
have to stop for sound problems.

Paul was in a dressing room
the size of, you know,

the handicap stall
in a men's bathroom.

We would be down all the time
sitting in the dark

'cause the generators
would blow out.

Every time I did Randy,

I had to get out
on a diving board

hanging out over the set,
laying on my stomach,

trying to marionette
this crude piece of folk art.

It was a nightmare.

It was a nightmare for them.
It was a nightmare for Paul.

I literally slept
in pee-wee's bunk bed.

Like, it seemed kind of like
a John waters movie, almost,

of, like, designer frenzy.

Almost everyone on that show

was doing their job
for the first time.

Tempers were flaring.

There was a lot
of coke burnouts.

It's like getting a job
playing in a sandbox

but they won't let you out
and they beat you.

It wasn't like
a Hollywood production at all.

It was like a downtown
New York art project,

and that's what gave it
its power and its edge.

It violated
every working code,

but because it was so creative
and so much fun,

I didn't care.

The minute it aired,
everybody just freaked over it.

[Upbeat bouncy music]

d d

Ahh!

d Come on in
and pull yourself up a chair d

Oh, I was a giant fan
of <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

I loved it.

I'd get up on Saturday mornings
to watch it.

It was a genius show.

They did an amazing job on it.

I thought,
"man, if this can work,

"if something this great
can actually make it on TV,

there's hope for us all."

I loved how completely
off-the-wall it was,

how it just went anywhere.

It woke people up
around the country.

They saw something fresh.

They saw something
that related to the culture.

We were just trying to--

I use the term
"blow their minds."

I just, like--
I want to do something

that people will talk about.

I want to do something
that people are gonna remember.

The <i>pee-wee's playhouse</i> show
was the psychedelic hippie show

that the hippies wanted to make.

The whole idea
was just to make something

that people wouldn't forget.

The shocking thing was,
is, it was, like,

a really successful TV show,
and it changed things,

and it was attracting
not just little kids,

like it was meant to do,

but it attracted kids
of all ages.

There was a whole big thing
with college kids staying up

to watch <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

It was big in the '80s.

It changed TV
in its own humble way.

d At pee-wee's playhouse d

[Chuckling]

The thing that triggered me
that I really realized

that it was a huge hit--
and it's an odd little thing--

is, I had a sister-in-law
that lived in New York,

in rural New York,
and she said that she got up

and went to a bar that was open
at 7:00 in the morning,

and the bar was full of people
watching <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

And then the second season,

we all moved the production
to L.A.

Paul got out of New York
as fast as he could.

He hated working there.

Yep, a lot of memories
in this old house.

But you know what I say?

I say, "[Bleep] It.

I'm going to California."

Ahh!

[Upbeat acoustic guitar music]

d d

Here we are in New Jersey.

Good-bye, Manhattan.

d d

The experience
was quite different in L.A.

It became
a Hollywood production.

It became
a professional production,

as it should be done,
of course.

Everybody's salary doubled.

I think, in L.A.,
they had no idea how--

how ripped off we were.

We moved into a sound stage,
and the sets were made

by a professional
set production place.

The puppets were made
by professional puppet makers.

You know, the whole system
was applied to it.

It just made it simpler.

You're a place that's meant
for what you're doing,

as opposed to you're doing
something somewhere

where every single problem,
the answer is,

"you're not supposed to be
doing this here."

You definitely--
there was definitely

a change of the guards.

You saw, you know, like,
responsible people on the set,

you know?

Instead of, like,
the <i>animal house</i> crew,

you know,
you definitely were with

whoever
the conservative fraternity was,

you know,
from the same movie.

Yeah, well,
we lost the desperate struggle.

It became, like, easy.

I mean, it was, like,
fun coming out here

and wearing sunglasses

and telling other people
what to do.

It was like, "yeah, now we're,
like, big shots."

I was digging
on the Hollywood myth.

It was a big lark,
days at the beach.

All those new yorkers
came too,

and they're mostly still here,
you know.

Wayne and Mimi
became Californians.

That was, like,
the free and easiest time

of my adult life,
and we were living it up.

You know,
we thought we were, at least.

You know, I love being married
to an artist

with a sense of humor.

We often collaborate.

We came up
with this gem together:

"Heinies n' shooters
with hotties at Hooters."


That's some high-tone poetry
right there, boys.


[Light jazzy music]

d d

Unfortunately, <i>pee-wee's</i>
<i>playhouse</i> ended in 1990.

He had been offered
two more seasons,

and he had declined.

And that was it.

There wasn't gonna be any more.

The playhouse
will always be here

for everyone to play in
forever and ever and ever.

On that,
you have my word.

I knew,
while I was doing it,

it was the best job
I would ever have in my life.

You knew
that you were making something

that you hadn't seen before.

It was in many ways
a dream job.

You know, it was, like,
a fun job.

You got to be
artistically fulfilled,

live in your inner child.

The group of people
that we wound up with

that created the show
were like this family.

It was like a big group
of artists

who really liked each other.

That's Alice.

And I remember when...

I mean, I just--
I get sentimental about them.

It was just--they were great.

We were a group of people

that felt like
we were making art

and we were doing something
serious and something important.

If you're an artist,

it doesn't get any better
than that, really.

There's--I can't think
of a better situation

that we could have had.

Beautiful.

It's the whole pastoral fantasy
that I have

when I come down here,
you know:

Rolling hills, green trees,
now a rainbow.

It's all too good.

I mean, it's picture-perfect,
you know?

Tennessee has always been
my little escape hatch.

Whenever the stress is too much,

I just fantasize
about moving to Mike's land

and living as a hermit.

Look, our rainbow is still there
leading us on.

I love it.

I love the sky and the trees.

This was my early
art education too.

We had to come out here
and draw the landscape.

In this house right here,
the yellow house,

this is where I did
my first puppet show,

called "punk and juicy,"
in 1978 with Mike Quinn,

and that started my illustrious
career with puppets.

Yeah, right there.

I was at a keg party.

[Engine grinding]

I never thought
about puppets ever.

I never played with them
as a kid,

never liked them as a kid,
never gave them two thoughts,

except for that one day
in Mike's dodge dart.

It used to be the caney fork
baptist church van.

[Engine turning over]

Painted the DNA on it,

because I went through a phase
of DNA being God

and all this stuff.

And I looked in the backseat

and saw all those

That's when it started,
right from that one day.

I mean, there's so many things
in my life

that I can pinpoint
to a certain moment, you know?

And then a wind came,
you know,

and blew a locust tree
right over the top of it.

And then I thought,
"well, heck,

let's just cut the top
off of it."

Oh, good, Wayne.
You're just in time.

[Upbeat banjo music]

d d

I've never met anybody
that didn't like Michael.

He can be a little surprising
at first, I think.

You know,
you've seen his car.

That's--kind of makes you wonder

what kind of person
would drive that.

d d

He's got a genius
for the moment,

and people respond to him
in amazing ways.

People just always get
to his core quickly, I think,

and see that he's
a great person.

d d

Okay, you guys, hold on,
no kidding.

Watch your face.

Watch your face.

Watch your face.

Watch your face.

Here's a big one.

Watch out.

Watch your face.

Here comes a hill.

Hold on.

Here we go.

Hold on.
Hold on.

Ahh!

We're not gonna make it.

[Laughs]

[Bluesy guitar music]

So I'm here at webb school
in bell buckle, Tennessee,

with my friend Mike Quinn,

and we're gonna make
a giant puppet

of the founder of webb school,
old sawney webb.

And hopefully we're gonna
parade it around out here

in the field somewhere.

This is the art department
of the webb school.

This is Mike's domain.

So--
okay, what you got?

Sawney is this giant
Southern daddy,

and he is our icon that we,
"sawney says.

"Sawney says.

Hey, sawney said it."

Well,
how many would be?

Four?
Four to make pant legs?

So it's gonna be
a psychedelic sawney.

[Laughs]
Yeah, psychedelic sawney.

Shh, don't say that.

[Light music]

d d

I like to improvise.

I'm building the head shape.

They don't have a big budget
to do this,

and we only have two days
to do it,

so we'll see what happens.

Just cut little tabs
of cardboard

that'll attach these.

Right now?
Yeah.

Okay.

Hot glue and cardboard
makes the world go round.

Yeah, I'm having a flashback
right now.

[Laughs]

It's great.

I like the limited resources
kind of thing too.

I like to use what's available.

It's a real spark
for creativity.

Long time, like, 19--I thought
it was <i>Mrs. cabobble's caboose.</i>

I think it was--
it was <i>cabobble's caboose.</i>

Hi, boys and girls.

I'm glad to see you today.

Come on in.

[Train horn tooting]

That was my first
real professional puppet

and set design job.

The local pbs station
in Nashville, wdcn,

they want to do a kids' show,
15-minute show, no commercials,

that taught first graders music.

d Cabobble's caboose d

It was a nice little set with,
like, four or five puppets.

There was hambone the dog,
who was an early cousin

of dirty dog
from <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

There was Monica the moose
and a talking stove.

I mean,
I had complete freedom.

I got my old friend Mike Quinn
a job as a character

named p.T. Pickens.

Oh, hi, Mrs. cabobble.

Hi.

Professor pickens,
how are you today?

Oh, just fine, Mrs. cabobble.

You could tell that Wayne
was sneaking in all of these

heavy art icons
into a kiddie show.

I've got a surprise for you
right here

in our wonderful music box.

Oh, yeah, and a music box,

where Alison had to sit
like this forever,

and then she comes up
and does this creepy smile

to the children.

Our music box
has some instruments for us

to play today,
and they're very easy to play.

It was my little weirdo joke,
you know,

and I had dived into it
with that spirit

all the whole time,
and it was weird.

They showed it for 16 years.

The kids loved it.

The thing I learned
from Mike at mtsu

was that art was a lifestyle.

It wasn't something
you just did for money,

although I certainly opted
for that.

It was was something you just do
as part of your life.

It's open for everybody.

Everything he did was art.

I mean, if he was
driving down the road

and saw mylar on the median,
he'd stop the car,

go out and get it, and come home
and make something out of it.

Only with Mike will I use
rainbow peace flags.

I do owe a lot of my success
to Mike.

Mike's the guy
who got me doing puppets.

The creation
of Wayne white myth.

The beard hairs, like,
go on loose like this

so there's slack in the middle.

Just follow that line there

and that line there.

This is the most fun part
right here,

doing the final painting.

Mike and I's past diverged,
obviously,

when I moved to New York

and he stayed behind
in Tennessee.

There they go.

There was a time
when I personally made

a conscious decision
to not pursue the path

that Wayne was taking.

I did not have that gumption.

Theyotd aka choice
to go to the big city

or to stay in the country,
and they took different choices,

but they still have similar...

Structure.

He decided to do
the pastoral life.

I don't know
if it was uswara

of being swallowed
by the big city,

that I really didn't think
I would have the success,

or that I was afraid
of the success--

I mean, honestly--

and the things
that it entangled you with.

You do have to sacrifice
some aspects

to pursue a career like that.

Likehere we are now, myself.

I like this business,
you know.

I've been to Wayne's place.

I like Wayne's place.

You know, they're both
really nice existences.

They're really good places
to be.

Yeah.

Well, I don't have a van the tof

that I can ride
through the woods, though.

Yeah, you're just waiting on
that tree to fall on your truck,

you know?

I knew I wasn't gonna stay.

That's not even
an alternative fantasy of mine.

I would have always thought,"wf

what if? What if?"


Yeah!

Whoo!

Bird, pie.

Well, the mannerisms of lyndon
are all crude, you know,

grabbing his crotch,
scratching his ass,

loping around,
big lopes.

He used to sit at a table
and reach over people

and grab food and slurp and slop
and eat with this mouth open,

a big old country boy tyrant.

He was a slacker.

He was a teenage layabout
on the farm.

He didn't do any farmwork.

He was a big, blustery,
fat-ass nerd.

You know, it's a certain type
that I just know.

It's very in-your-face
and visceral, you know.

You know, I should put, like,
cheap cologne

all over this thing.

It should have a smell to it
also.


Up till this time,
I'd been pampered

working on this hit show
and working as a performer

and three emmys by now also.

I had rose-colored glasses on.

[Light rock music]

But if you really want
to impress the ladies,

you got to do
the rock videos.

Yeah, smashing pumpkins'
<i>tonight, tonight.</i>

I actually made this,
painted it all.

That's what got me my trip
to the mtv video awards in 1997,

where I was ignored
like a leprous nerd.


That was the worst night
of my life, those video awards.

What a crock of [Bleep].

I'm sorry.
That's too bitter, isn't it?

There aren't
that many great

production designer/
artists/creative thinkers

out there,

and so when you find
someone good,

like Wayne,
you go back to him.

That was my first project
with Jonathan and Valerie

and went on to do several others
with them...

[Dog barking]

Like the snapple commercials
with the bottles...

[Whistling a sprightly tune]

And the old spice commercial,

and that's when I painted this
60-foot-long schooner sailboat.

I kept working in kids' TV.

I did a show
called <i>shining time station.</i>

Ringo starr
was the tiny little conductor

that lived in the wall.

I did a show called
<i>riders in the sky</i> for CBS.

Good morning, Wayne.

Good morning, Doug.
It's great to see you.

A Tennessee boy makes good
in the wild and wacky

wonderful world of Hollywood.

It was like
pee-wee goes west, practically,

as far as the decor.

It was, like, cowboy kitsch.

This is the most beautiful
thing that has ever been seen

in Hollywood
thanks to Wayne white,

Tennessee genius.

Unfortunately,
the show was a disaster.

It was a giant bomb.

There was a lot of bad feelings
around it.

Everybody was mad at each other.

[Bleep] Are you doing,
Wayne, you sucker?

Man,
you [Bleep] me with this set.

I hate you.

It was a lesson,
you know?

That's what happens
in Hollywood too.

You come in
with your dickhead drawings.

I never see you.
You're always hiding out.

You're getting too much money
for too little work.

I ought to kill you.

I don't ever want
to see you again.

And that was my first taste
of how things

could go horribly wrong.

I was supposedly hot property,

because I was
of this generation.

Of course, everybody wanted
to find the next Matt groening

and the next <i>Simpsons,</i>

'cause <i>the Simpsons</i>
had broke big.

I had done
a five-minute puppet film

for mtv's
<i>liquid television</i> series.

It was a thing called
<i>bill and Willis.</i>

And it was just, like,
all over town

for 2 1/2, 3 years.

I did a lot of pitching.

I was just in and out
of these offices everywhere,

CBS, abc, nbc, nickelodeon,
cartoon network.

It was a real "banging your head
up against the wall"

kind of thing.

I hated that.

Oh, God.

That was the worst ever.

And, of course,
I like to talk

about my old days in showbiz
with my paintings:

"All that fake laughin'
for nothin'."


How many times do I sit
in a meeting with some producer

and he's going, "yeah,
it's gonna be just like <i>pee-wee,</i>

"you know?

"It's gonna have, like,
a <i>pee-wee</i> set.

"He's gonna have a talking dog,
and the kids are gonna come in,

"and it's gonna be crazy,

and there's gonna be [Bleep]
coming down from the sky."

And I'm sitting there going,
"ha-ha-ha-ha, that's great.

You're gonna pay me, right?"


You know, I remember
coming out to California

for the first time.

You already are apprehensive
about what it's gonna be like,

and then you get out here,

and it's even worse
than you think,

and it's even more intense
than you think, and it's--

the business is filthier,
you know, when it's for real.

There's a lot of ego,
greed, stupidity, and insanity,

and that's
a really bad combination.

He felt like he had
to pursue Hollywood

because that's where he had
to make his livelihood.

And it was a lot of pressure
on him.

I mean,
I don't have enough money

to sit around and enjoy it.

I got to keep making
that money, you know.

I don't have "'f' you" money.


I wish I did,

because I would just say,
"[Bleep] You," to everybody

and go enjoy it,
but I can't.

I mean, isn't that the--
that's the American dream.

"[...] You."


Basically, it is.

That's what the American dream
is about: "'F' you" money.

I would work myself
into exhaustion.

I got a job in <i>beakman's world</i>
that same year.

I was, like, this
one-man animation department

for the show.

That doesn't work.

You can't be
a one-man animation department.

It'll kill you.

He really was like a slave
in that place.

I did this series for
the Disney channel, <i>circle time.</i>

That was another project
that spiraled me into craziness.

I did an offspring video,
<i>she's got issues.</i>

That [Bleep] place
drove me crazy.

And I got overworked
and overworked and overworked,

by the time I finished
that offspring video,

I was out of my mind.

I had driven myself nutty,
crazy.

You need to know when to say,
"I need help,"

and Wayne liked
to do it all himself.

I didn't realize
how hard of work it was

and how it was going to bruise
my brain like a piece of fruit.

I took to calling him
"the thing in the basement,"

because he--you know, he grew
this long, grizzled beard,

and he was just doing nothing
but animating

on this computer downstairs
for weeks at a time.

I would just be exhausted
and just out of my mind.

That would make me
kind of crazy,

because I would worry
about his health.

It was mental.

It would finally crack.

I got very depressed
and incapacitated.

That's when I started
on the happy pills,

the antidepressants.

Eventually....

Psssh, psssh!

Doing!

Wayne's got
his video camera on,

and he's finally making
that video of the house

that he's been threatening to
all this time.

I'm assuming he's gonna bring it
with him.

Oh, are--

oh, my God.

Are you gonna bring the camera
with you?

Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah, he is. Good.

Now I'll have to look
at myself saying,

"are you gonna bring the camera
with you?"

About five times
while we're in New York.

I couldn't have done any of this
without Mimi.

She's, like, the grown-up
in our relationship.

Well, I learned everything
from her.

She's created
an amazing home life for me.

Say, "hi, daddy."

She does so many things
that both buoy and support him

that it wouldn't surprise me
to hear somebody go, like,

"oh, she's the brains
behind the whole thing."

I think she affords him
the ability to do what he does.

The winner.

Mimi is sort of the glue that
kind of keeps everybody moving.

She's sort of the center
of the universe that, like,

kind of keeps all the planets
in orbit.

That goes for the kids
as well as Wayne.

She was very serious
about being a good mother

and a good nurturer to our kids,
and yeah, that took up her time

that normally would have gone
into artwork,

so she has paid a price.

Her career as an artist
did have to kind of be put

on the back burner
a little bit.

And here we go.

There's--
there's the first episode,

<i>Simpsons roasting</i>
<i>on an open fire.</i>

Writer: Mimi pond.

It's painful to sort of,
like, watch it fall away,

and you wonder if you're ever
gonna do anything ever again,

and it's really frustrating.

There was a point at which
I felt absolutely invisible.

Hey,
what are you looking at?

I was like,
"how badly do I want this career

as a opposed to experiencing
my children's childhood?"

And that was important to me.

I see you.

It's hard to be a mom.

It really is.

The compensation is,

is, we've raised
these two incredible kids,

and we've had
a lot of happiness.

Those letters seem very nice.

Yes, aren't they?

She's never questioned
any of my moves artistically,

always supported them.

Plus,
she's smarter than I am.

The handful of artists
that I know

that have been wildly prolific
have this sort of secret backup

of this family that's always
been there for them,

and it certainly is in spades
in the white family.

He's already, like, driven
himself crazy most of the time,

so I'm just there to go,
"it's okay."


"There, there.

It'll be all right."

What do you like
about puppets?

I like the fact
that they come alive.

They're animated.

You could draw a character,
build a character,

and it lives
outside of your imagination

and goes into the world,
so that's a thrill.

I mean, it's all coming true
right now.

It's great.

d d

[People speaking indistinctly]

Here we go.
Stand by.

And places, please.

Places down on the floor.

Rolling.

I had to really knock my head
up against the wall hard

to realize things in Hollywood,

and that's the way
Hollywood is, man.

It's tough,
and I can't whine about it,

because I knew the rules
going in.

Then I came to the realization

that I didn't want to work
in Hollywood.

It wasn't worth it to me.

And the fire went out completely
on that.

So that's when I started
thinking about painting more.

I just took a break
from the whole thing

and reassessed my whole drive
and what I really wanted.

I wanted to work by myself
in a studio.

That's what the whole one-man
animation thing was about.

But see,
it was all wrongheaded.

And I'd do, like,
civil war battles.

I did the battle
of lookout Mountain.

I did steamboats
coming down the Tennessee river.

Here's one called
<i>de soto in Alabama</i>

and <i>young George Washington's</i>
<i>dream</i>

and for some reason,
this is about two wolfmen

fighting in a room
with historical paintings

hanging in it.

I'm not sure what that means.


Wolfmen--I don't know.


The historical scenes
were becoming more surreal.

I was starting to put
weird things in them.

It was all in the spirit
of absurdity.

My message was just,
I wanted to have fun.

Here it is.

This is one of the original
word paintings that I did.

It was on paper.

This was when I was still doing
realist paintings.

This is the first time
I put words in them.

Unfortunately it's a sign
that has fallen down

in the woods mysteriously.

And it says, "a cowardly robot
in a 1930s desert sunset."

I mean, what the [Bleep]
does that mean, right?

So I started buying
these thrift store paintings

just for the frames.

And right before
I kicked it out, I thought,

"hmm, you know,
maybe I should just use

the landscape
that's already in there."


"It would save a lot of time."

[Laughter and applause]

Thus was born
my first word painting:

<i>Human [Bleep]ing knowledge.</i>


I thought nothing of it.

I thought,
"this is just a gag, you know.

"This is funny.

Ha-ha.
Look at this."

People would come by the studio,

and I would try to show them
my latest opus,

and they would be more
interested in this word painting

on the thrift store painting.

More so than any painting
I'd every done.

I mean,
it was night and day, you know?

It was weird.

Before I knew it,
I'd done 10 or 15 of them,

and I decided to take them down
to a local coffee shop

called Fred 62.

When I designed the place,
I left the walls empty,

and I thought to myself,

"someone's gonna come
in the door

with something really cool."

I started selling them
right off the walls.

You know, I'd go down there
and have to reach over the table

where people were eating
and take it down

and put up a new one.

You know, "excuse me.
Excuse me.


You know, 'cause they never
close that place.

Generally speaking, if you're
showing in a coffee shop,

you're not gonna end up
on a white-walled gallery,

but it--it happens.

So then there's this packet,

and it has this name "w. White"
on it.

I'm like...
So I opened it up,

and there's no--there's no names
on any of the slides.

There's no address.

There's no phone number.

There's nothing.

So I hold it up,
and I'm looking at it,

and I said, "this is the guy
that has those paintings

in Fred 62."

And he was really excited
about them,

that there was this buzz
about them at Fred's.

You know, people were talking
about them and stuff,

complete surprise to me.

They're so cool visually.

They're so ingenious
that they work on that level,

and then when you
actually read them,

they're either pointed
or funny or both.

But at first, I was--
you know,

I was just too much of a snob
to think it was

worth looking at for long.

It was actually--
you know, it was--

I had the problem,
it was too fun.

It's kind of, like,
this sense of relief.

Like, I can go in,
and I can actually kind of have

a good time in a gallery.

And then, you know,
months went by,

and I saw it somewhere else,
and I'm like,

"oh there's more there."

Then I started to think
a lot more about it.

I think he's really a poet
as well as a painter

in the use of his language.

I keep a notebook
just of phrases:

"Pot, cheetos, Dr. pepper,

<i>"more than a feeling</i>
by Boston,

the invisible people
I've been trying to impress

my whole life."

You know, my mission
is to bring humor into fine art,

and that sounds kind of silly,
I know, but I really do.

I want to bring humor,
and I mean real humor,

funny stuff,
not art-world funny,

real-world funny.

And if you agree with me,

I think you're gonna come up
against some resistance,

'cause there's a lot of people
in the art world

with sticks up their butts,

and if you meet somebody
like that,

all you got to do is say,

"I'll smash this painting
over your [Bleep] head."


I saw Wayne's first
New York show, and it was--

I was astonished.

It really just blew me away,

and I had to find out more
about it and him.

This is called <i>sexy paintings by</i>
<i>sexy painters for sexy people,</i>

and I always loved
that there's little teeny ghosts

of the red underpaintings,
which, you know,

indicate very classically
trained painting skills.

There's nothing amateurish
about anything that he does,

and this is
seriously skilled work.

I've done this only a few times
in my life, thankfully,

but I battled my way in
to meet him.

You know,
out comes the drawings,

and comes the this,
and out comes the that,

and it's like,
where did he come from?

After seeing all that Wayne
had in the studio that day,

it was so clear.

You know, right away,
I knew that we

had to do this book.

It's one those days, a visit,
and your life changes.

The title of the book is
<i>maybe now I'll get the respect</i>

<i>i so richly deserve.</i>

Bam.
It happened immediately.

I mean, it was, like, on it.

Bang,
I'm in the art world,

just like that,

just like that.


[Quirky music]

Now, I've been doing
these paintings since 1878.


I've done
approximately 859,372.

When you do that many versions
of the same thing,

you tend to get
a little burnt out.

And I've been thinking lately
about puppets,

about coming full circle
back to my puppet land.

And it all started
two years ago

down at rice university
in Houston

with the biggest puppet
I ever made.

[Upbeat twangy guitar music]

d d

"Big 'lectric fan

"to keep me cool

while I sleep."

Ladies and gentlemen,

the world's largest
George Jones head.

d Well, a big 'lectric fan d

d to keep me cool
while I sleep d

Well, I was originally
inspired to do this piece

when I was invited here
in June, and, of course,

it was 102 degrees,

and I had this George Jones song
stuck in my head,

<i>ragged but right.</i>

The colossal country music
legend sleeps it off

in the hot Houston night,
while the fan says,

"I'm dreaming, dreaming,
dreaming.

"Oh, I'm not dreaming.

I'm bragging."


You know, braggin'...


It is a vulgar
and pernicious thing to do.

I'm telling you right now.

It's not important
that I've won

one, two, three emmys
for <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

It's not important at all

that I've won
the best art direction

for the smashing pumpkins'
<i>tonight, tonight.</i>

"Look at this [Bleep].

It's worth a lot of money."

Not bad.

"Just leave the awards
on the kitchen table.

I'm back here painting
a [Bleep] masterpiece."


That's pretty good, huh?


I think when you're an artist,
you're in this struggle,

because you want
to put yourself out there.

You're doing this thing
that's ultimately

very self-centered
and narcissistic, right?

Like, "look at me.

I'm good."

You know,
there's that part of me that's,

"shame, shame, shame on you
for getting up there

"and being the center
of attention,

"you big show-off.

Who the--who's he think he is?"

You know?

So because you're an artist,
you're also full of self-doubt,

self-loathing,
worrying, neurosis,

all that stuff,
so you're torn.

You want to put your stuff
out there

just because of the exuberance
of being creative,

and then you feel bad
about yourself.

So I see that in Wayne's work.

The "who's he think he is?"
Phantom is always in my head,

always, even though
I'm looking around and going,

"well, who's even saying that
to you anymore, Wayne?

"Your parents
are both applauding you.

"They're not saying that.

"All these other ass[Bleep],
your coaches and teachers,

"they're all dead.

They don't--
or they don't know who you are."

It's like, "who is this
'who's he think he is?' Phantom

still haunting you,
you know?"

I don't know.

I keep telling him
how lucky he is.

How many people
get to experience

a midlife sudden career change--

I've--I know.
I am lucky.

I tell him how lucky we are
all the time.

We've been incredibly lucky.

I had a second chance that
hardly anybody ever gets, man.

It's like, who said,

"there's no second acts
in American life,"

f. Scott Fitzgerald?

[...] You,
f. Scott Fitzgerald.


Well, for me,
I feel incredibly proud,

and I'm incredibly glad.

It doesn't seem like
that much time has passed.

He's managed to put
this thing together,

you know, and so
I'm wondering now, what next?

What next?

I didn't quite know
where I was going

or what I wanted to do.

I was kind of figuring it out
as I went along.

I just kind of follow my heart
and my gut.

This is exactly it.

It's what I've wanted
since I was three years old,

to sit in the room
and draw pictures.

I think the future for Wayne
is recognition for the fact

that he was a founding father
of the current state of pop art.

And Wayne
is a wonderful puzzle.

It's like one of those puzzles
you'll never finish,

because there's always
more pieces to kind of consider.

I'm satisfied, yeah.

I do have
a lot of satisfaction.

I'm too neurotic to enjoy it
for very long.

I'm working
on my graphic novel

that I sold
about a year and a half ago.

You know, I'm writing.
I'm working. I'm drawing.

So I'm back.

I'm really thrilled
for his success,

and I'm really happy
to finally get, you know,

the respect
I so richly deserve.


I just have a feeling
it's all up from here, you know?

I--you know,
and I try not to overthink it

and look too far
into the future.

What if this happens,
or what if that happens?

I do that.
That's his job.

I can't--you know,
it's got to be, like,

one day at a time for me.

I see myself as, hopefully,
in museums across the world,

hopefully,
surrounded by grandchildren.

We never had any idea
that he'd ever go this far,

but we knew that was all
he was gonna ever do,

because that's all he ever
wanted to do.

But he wanted it bad enough,
and he went out and did it.

[Engine thrumming]

Onward and upwards.

I hope Wayne is happy.

I--I hope everything
goes well for him,

but I hope he's happy.

I just want him to be happy.

He's got his art,
and that's his life.

[Upbeat music]

Beauty is embarrassing.

Now,
what do I mean by that?

Beauty is a many-pronged thing,
you know?

It has many sides to it.

When we see something beautiful,
truly beautiful,

we're in awe,

and raw emotion
comes to the surface.

We're also humbled by it.

We're not worthy.

That emotional vulnerability,
that insecurity,

those are both
embarrassing situations.

"If only I could make
something that beautiful,"

or,
"if only I was that beautiful."

So we're sort of embarrassed
for ourselves

when we're struck
by true beauty.

Artists and creative people
are people who make beauty.

Now, that's the bottom line.

I mean,
that's what we do.

We make beauty.

I've been trying to make beauty
my whole life,

and just to even say that
is embarrassing, but I have.

So, ladies and gentlemen,

I owe you a very big debt
of gratitude,

'cause this is a rare
and special time

for me right now.

You let me stand up here

and show you
all my beautiful things,

and I didn't
get embarrassed once.

Follow your heart
and your pleasure in art.

Don't do what you think
is gonna be making you money

or what your parents
want you to do

or what that beautiful girl
or guy

thinks you should be doing.

Do what you love.

It's gonna lead
to where you want to go.

Go out there and make the world
more beautiful.

I know you can.

My name is Wayne white.
Thank you.

[Cheers and applause]
