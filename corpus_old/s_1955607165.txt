<i>Welcome to the "Pretty Little Liars</i>

<i>A-List Wrap Party."</i>

I'm Ji Mai, a "PLL" fanatic,

and your host for tonight.

<i>I've got an exclusive VIP access</i>

<i>to the hottest party in Hollywood.</i>

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>I am so excited for this wrap party,</i>

but I'm also a little sad too.

I mean, this is our last one.
Oh, I'm so excited.

I think this is awesome
mainly just because

<i>it's the best crew that
I've ever worked with.</i>

Can't believe it's been seven years.

<i>Wrap parties are always fun,</i>

and this is our final wrap party

so it's gonna be really awesome.

I'm very, very excited.

<i>We've been working hard for seven years</i>

so it's just time for us to celebrate.

Everyone deserves to
have a really good night.

<i>I'm sure craziness will ensue.</i>

You guys, we're about to turn up

with the entire "PLL" squad.

I'm gonna dig up some dirt,
get you some juicy secrets.

Are you ready? 'Cause
its about to be on.

<i>The "Pretty Little Liars
A-List Wrap Party."</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

Here we are inside the
private A-List room

of the series final wrap party

with the five prettiest
little liars on television.

Troian Bellisario, Ashley Benson,

Lucy Hale, Shay Mitchell,
and Sasha Pieterse.

How are you guys?

All: Good.
Yeah.

Okay, mind blown with
this last episode.

Did you have any idea that
it would end like this?

No.
Some of us did.

I think, Troian, you've
known for a while.

You knew for a while, right?

We didn't know.
Mm-mm.

I...
But you've always... I think

some of us go to Marlene and
we're like "So, tell us."

Marlene did not tell me.
Yeah.

Marlene would not tell
me this time though.

I did not know anything.

I actually overheard the ending

from another castmate and
I didn't want to know.

What?
I genuinely did not want

to know until the end and so...
What do you mean?

Like you're walking by the
water cooler and somebody...

Who was it?
Drew Van Acker.

What?
Oh, come on.

<i>He knew, and that's how I found out.</i>

Drew ruined it for me, but I loved it.

Okay, so you found out through Drew?

Yeah.
And then, Shay,

you were saying somebody
else knew before you?

Yeah, I mean, I think sometimes

throughout the years, you know,

some of us will go and ask the writers

<i>to kind of explain to
us what's gonna happen,</i>

<i>but for this one, yeah, I think Troian,</i>

you were the first one out of us

to know what was gonna happen.

Which makes sense.
That's so true to you,

even on your character on the show,

<i>like, of course Troian would
be the first to know.</i>

How did you find out?

I found out because I'm A.D.

Yeah, she's A.D.
I had to know.

I understand. When I
was watching, you know,

it all go down after it was revealed,

you, Alex, the whole thing,
I literally was like,

"I don't think I can still
talk about this yet

because it's still so unreal."

This is seven years of not knowing.

Yeah.
So how did you find out?

Was it a script you read, like...

No, no, no, I was always somebody

who really liked to know...
Okay. Yeah.

And I like to know what was coming up

and I was constantly just
asking Marlene like,

"Please tell me, please
tell me, please tell me."

Finally she sort of pulled
me aside privately.

I think that was two years ago now.

What?
Wow! Wait.

Yeah.
It was that long ago?

Well, she was thinking
in terms of the end game.

Oh, it's just so nerve-racking

because I feel like that's

the biggest responsibility
for "Pretty Little Liars"

is who carries out the
final "dun-dun-dun."

So that's an honor for you to be...

I's a total honor...
Yeah.

But at the same time,
like, it was so much fun

to get to play Alex and
Spencer in the finale,

but also, like, every scene
that we got to share,

you know, together, like,

just us closing out our storylines

with, you know, watching the two of you

close out your storyline

and watching, like, the Ezria wedding,

<i>which I still get so scared
talking about these things.</i>

I feel like I'm spoiling things.

You guys have seen everything.

There's nothing I can spoil.
Oh, my gosh.

Now you mentioned about
emotional moments

watching the girls in
the finale episode.

What was epic to you guys?

What was hard to shoot?

What was the mood like?

Our good-bye scene in the script,

<i>we didn't shoot it on the last day</i>

<i>but the dialogue was
just even hard to say.</i>

<i>I think they only got,
like, one good take</i>

<i>because my voice was cracking</i>

and I, like, couldn't
actually get the words out.

Yeah, it was weird
to get the direction.

Marlene had to come in and be like,

"Could you be less emotional?"

It was sad.
Yeah.

All right, Shay, Sasha,

fans have been all about Emison

since, like, day one.

Did you guys ever think

that these two would get
their happy ending?

Kind of.
Kind of, yeah, I don't know.

Emily's had so many girlfriends.

I think I've had more relationships

<i>on this show than anybody.</i>

<i>So it's been a revolving door</i>

<i>of, like, girlfriends for Emily,</i>

but I think, I mean,

that's definitely what
the fans wanted and,

you know, we've worked
together since the beginning.

And Alison had so many
terrible relationships,

and Emily I think was the only one that,

like, truly loved her in that way.

Right.
So, her recognizing that

I think was really sweet and important.

Yeah.
Right.

What was it like shooting
the proposal scene?

It was funny, yeah.

I think it was very fitting
that it wast smooth,

like we were in an argument.
Yeah.

We're not going to sleep

until you tell me what's in that purse.

You make me a better woman
because you searched for one.

Do you promise to do that every day

for the rest of our lives?
I love you too.

Shooting the scenes with
our daughters was very fun

'cause you had one...
Yeah.

I know!
Twin that was crying

the whole time, and one that was happy.

So we'd have to kind of switch.

Yeah.
And then in, like,

a couple of our takes even

I'm pretending to have one in this arm,

but they would only show this baby...

Yeah, 'cause the other one was crying.

But I'm still moving this arm, yeah.

<i>But not only that, they
actually do look identical.</i>

<i>And the only way that we
could really tell them apart</i>

<i>was their earrings, yeah.</i>

<i>One had pink flowers,
the other one had blue.</i>

It was really cute, yeah.

Oh, my gosh, and Lucy for you, too.

Ezria was the only relationship

<i>that started way back
in the pilot episode.</i>

<i>So how did it feel to
have something that,</i>

like, lasted for so long?

You know what, the fans of
Ezria, they deserved that.

It felt right, like, I mean, it was...
the strangest thing

was reciting those vows though.

I don't know, it just felt very real.

I don't know, it was weird.

<i>But I can't image them
not being together.</i>

I mean, they've been
through everything, so.

Right, wait I just
have to rewind you to

when you were saying it felt so real.
What do you mean?

No I was just... not
that I want to marry Ian

in real life,

but that having to say that in real life

would feel very strange, yeah.

Yes, it actually takes you
through what it's like to say

that to somebody, and look
into their eyes and...

Nerve-racking, and in that moment

we could never break eye contact

for the whole scene.
Right.

And I could tell
internally he was laughing,

and I internally was laughing

'cause he does this
thing with his mouth.

<i>I was like, "Just don't do this to me."</i>

<i>- I know.
Because usually it's just</i>

hard to get through scenes with him,

so it was funny.

And the fans appreciated it much.

So, Ashley, I have to ask you,

Hannah was the closest to
Mona throughout the series

<i>and I want to know at the very end,</i>

<i>did Hannah suspect Mona was Team A.D.</i>

or did she think she was playing

the game the whole time?
What do you think?

Even when Mona... I mean,
after she tried to kill me,

like, running me over with a car, like,

Hannah still wanted to be by
her side and stick up for her.

Why would you bring her
to my rehearsal dinner?

I'm sorry, okay? I didn't
know what else to do.

The last time we saw Mona she tried

to push you off the bell tower.

Yeah, and she feels bad about that.

Is Mona a good person?
Like, is Mona bad?

<i>No, I think she's good.</i>

<i>You know, the game was a very big thing</i>

<i>and it's a huge secret
between me and the girls,</i>

and when Hannah broke that trust

and introduced the game

to Mona she needed Mon's help.

She knew that Mon's
mind could get them to

where they had to be
to finish the game...

Right.
So Mona really

helped them out.

And how did you feel
when you found out

that Haleb was pregnant?

I always told Marlene

I wanted to have kids on the show.

So that was her little
way of sneaking in

that I was gonna have a kid.

[laughter]
Oh!

There's so much juiciness here.
I love this.

Okay, well, we have to sneak
into a break right now,

but we'll have more of the cast

with an exclusive on-the-set,

behind-the-scenes look at the finale.

But first, we gave each of our liars

a little time to think
about what they've done

and to come clean in our
photo booth confessions.

You'll be seeing their confessions

all through the night.

Don't even think about
leaving this party.

I's just started, guys.

<i>â™ª</i>

This show changed my life

because you made this a success.

You tweeted with us, you
Instagrammed with us,

you watched every episode.

You were there through everything.

I would not be sitting here

giving you this message if
it weren't for all of you.

So I thank you from the
very bottom of my heart.

You've made the experience

one that will be the best of my life,

and I love you guys so much.

<i>â™ª</i>

Remember when you were
a total bitch to us?

Yeah, yeah.

What are you doing here?
Yeah.

Welcome back to the
"Pretty Little Liars

A-List Wrap Party."

We were just chatting about
what it's like to be

wrapping up the show after
seven life-changing seasons.

My favorite moments since I follow

all you guys on socials

is when you posted about
your last table read.

That was a really emotional moment.

What was going on through
your minds, you guys?

<i>It was sad having
everyone in the same room,</i>

<i>and coming together, and crazy.</i>

<i>It was just a very weird moment,</i>

<i>and emotions definitely took over.</i>

Right.
I had so many tissues

in front of me, yeah.

Aw.
Welcome to Episode 720

of "Pretty Little Liars,"
"Till Death Do Us Part."

No, this isn't about money.

I's about having a home, and parents,

and friends who risk their
lives for each other.

Knowing it never really ends.

Even the grown men
executives were crying.

No way.

<i>Yes, there were men in suits crying.</i>

<i>But it just... it goes to show
how special the show was...</i>

<i>I think it's just bad because
when you connect eyes with,</i>

like, somebody... like,
every time I see,

like, Ashle's crying then I bawled,

and I'm bawling, then she bawl...
it's, like...

<i>- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, everybody was crying</i>

<i>in that room that day.</i>

I think it sunk in, like,
this is the last time

I will ever play this character

and I feel like Aria
became part of my identity

because like I said we
spent our 20s on the show.

That's when you're growing up

<i>and figuring yourself out and...</i>

Yeah, and we also remember that room

when we had our first table read,

like, I know what
everybody was wearing...

Yeah, I know.
I remember that so vividly.

It was the same room we had our first

and last table read in the same...

Yeah, that wasn't hard.

Hey, that's awesome.
Yeah.

All right, if you weren't
casted your character

and you could be casted
another character,

who would you want to be?

I've always said Mona.
Really?

<i>I really like Mona. Yeah, just because</i>

she's been, like, eight
different characters.

<i>There's kind of a little
Mona in all of us I feel like.</i>

Yeah, split personality?
Yeah, totally.

I've always said Spencer
because I love the character,

but I think it's because it's Troian.

There could be no other Spencer.

Right.

That actually kind of reminds me

of we were doing a scene together

and I was looking at Sasha
playing Alison and, like,

we were all, like, lovey-dovey
and, like, we're all friends

and I was thinking that she was, like,

gonna marry Emily and I was like,

"Remember when you were
a total bitch to us?"

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yes.
What are you doing here?

What a change!
All right, Troian,

tell us about your role.

I mean, with the Alex and
being a different character

but looking the same,
and the British accent.

It was just a total
blast and the crew, like,

joined in with me doing the accent.

It was, like, almost, like, British Day

whenever I would come and
everybody would... everybody

just kept on talking to
me in a British accent

and I was like, "Well, this
makes it easier for me

to continue, I guess."

But yeah, it was a total blast.

Doing scenes with yourself is insane

<i>because I would come in and
Marlene would be like,</i>

"Okay, who do you want
to rehearse as first?

Do you want to be Alex or Spencer?"

And I would say, "All right,

"well, I want to be Alex
because she's the one

"who has the freedom to
move around in the scene

because Spencer's chained to the bed."

Who are you?
[laughs] Really?

How hard did Mona hit you?

I'm just a girl who met a man
when he came in from the rain.

That's really cool to picture now,

now that we've seen how it played out

to see what you were actually
doing behind the scenes.

Yeah.

Who did you channel to get that Alex?

Were there any inspirations
or any moments in your life

that you needed to get to
get that grit and that?

Actually I watched a lot
of, like, Sid Vicious.

I wanted her to feel...
Oh, my gosh.

Very, very punk and Sid Vicious just,

like, didn't care at all about the way

that he was coming across.

He just did whatever he wanted.

That to me was Alex, especially

because it's such a contrast

to I think the way Alex views Spencer

which is so strung up,

and tight, and, like, all of this.

So whenever I wanted to be
Alex I wanted to just be,

like, a mess and, like, spit
and yell and everything.

Alex looked like a hot ball of fun.

I wouldn't have minded,
like, meeting Alex...

She's a hot mess, yeah.
In a pub somewhere.

How does it feel now after
a long seven-year journey

to, I mean, literally
after this wrap party

know that you're not going to come back,

and you're not going to work together...

Don't say that.
And you're not gonna see

a lot of this crew.

How does that feel?

I think I'm gonna miss
the people the most,

that's the thing.

<i>I's like, our crew is hands down</i>

<i>the most amazing people
I've ever worked with,</i>

and they're not all gonna be

in the same place at the same time.

But it is a small world.

Like, I'm sure one day down the line

I'll work with Jill who
does sound, or Carlos...

Yes.
Who does B-camera, like,

I'm stoked to see what everyone does

'cause I know we're all gonna go off

and do really cool things

and take these fans from the show.

I know they're gonna support
us in whatever we do.

What about for you, Ashley?
I think that the show ended

at the time that it was
supposed to and I think

that we're all very proud

of how successful the show has been

and just knowing that we've
touched so many people's lives

and the last episode was
truly our best episode ever.

I mean, we're always
going to be a family.

This is not the end for any of us,

so tonight our wrap
party, it's not like,

"Oh, my God, I'm never
gonna see you again."

I's, "I can't wait to see you again,

or work with you or whatever," you know?

Really, really cool.
I's just kind of crazy

'cause, like, growing up
with, like, "Dawson's Creek"

or "The O.C." and when those shows ended

I remember how, like, heartbroken I was,

and now that's, like, our show.
Yeah.

The last day of shooting
was such an emotional day,

not only because of what
you guys are sharing,

but your fans knew this too.

I mean, Ashley, you shared
on Snapchat you were crying

and I felt it through your emotions

that you were really...
things come to the end.

I know, Shay, for you too,
you were getting emotional.

What was that like for you
guys shooting the ending,

getting emotional,

and then also how are you
conveying this to your fans?

I Snapchatted just because
I thought it was really cool

for the fans to see,
like, our last moments

together and, like, how
we are with our crew

and the relationships that we've built

and, you know, it was all, like,

just a very genuine feeling
that we were just, like,

leaving something that's been
so much a part of our lives

for the last seven years and
I think it was really cool

for the fans to know, like,

this is our last day,
her's what it looks like,

her's what we're going through and...

How much we care about everyone.

Yeah, I think it was really cool

for them to see our last day

because we share it with them...

Right, they've been

a part of our journey
for the entire way...

We share every... yeah,
for the seven years.

So, like, when the final moments

you also want to share it with them,

even if our eyelashes are coming off

and we're crying our eyes out, you know?

Right, I cried, it was so hard.

Since we know this was going

to be a monumental occasion

we sent a camera crew to
the set for the last day

of shooting for the final episode.

We wanted to see what that
was like for all of you,

and of course share it
with all your fans.

So let's take a look at it right now.

That's what those cameras were for.

All right, now we know.
Now we know.

Rolling sound.

Action.

<i>â™ª</i>

[cheers and applause]

The last day was very strange.

<i>I had never felt a feeling
of feeling really sad</i>

but at the same time excited.

I'm excited about the
future, but I'm so sad

and upset to leave behind something

<i>that means the world to me.</i>

The last day was really hard.

<i>There were so many emotions</i>

and I came to set and I started crying.

I just remember being like...
[gasping sobs]

Like, not being able to breathe.

I just remember being
totally punch-drunk.

I was shooting in every scene
twice, fighting with myself.

Well, I am Spencer now!

It was just completely overwhelming.

Every time we saw someone we
couldn't look them in the eye

because we would literally
automatically start crying.

Action. <i>- It was a big wedding scene.</i>

All the girls were there
which felt right.

<i>It felt right to do that
scene on the last day,</i>

<i>and actually the last take,</i>

<i>the last camera shot was me crying</i>

so it totally worked 'cause
I was already upset.

That is a series wrap
on Sasha Pieterse!

[cheers and applause]

There was no dry eye at all.

We were all hugging and, you know,

crying and laughing at the same time.

This is such an amazing experience

<i>and it's a celebration.</i>

Troian Bellisario!

[cheers and applause]

It was all gonna be over
and there was nothing

that you could do to stop
the passage of time.

Ashley Benson! [Cheers and applause]

We've had the best cast, and the crew,

and everyone who's been working with us

<i>have done such an incredible job</i>

making an amazing show.

Shay Mitchell! [Cheers and applause]

Being on the show for
these past seven seasons

has been the best time of my life.

Lucy Hale!
It was emotional.

I don't think there was
a dry eye in the house

from all the crew members, to
the cast, to the producers.

Thank you for working so
hard, and being so fantastic,

and to seven seasons
of love I say cheers.

All: Cheers!
[cheers and applause]

This party is just getting started.

We'll be right back with the cast

and the mischievous
mind behind the show.

Don't go anywhere, or else.

<i>â™ª</i>

I's weird saying good-bye to you

because it's not a good-bye.

I just wanted to say thank
you for everything.

You guys are so amazing.

We did this all for you,

and it was seriously worth every second.

A lot of you have said how
much "PLL" has affected you

and I want you to know that
you guys have affected us

and just, like, a really big thank you.

I have so much gratitude in my heart.

<i>â™ª</i>

Everybody has said to me...
everyone on this couch

has said to me that they wanted
to be "A" at some point in time.

No way!

And now the party can
really get started

because we have the mastermind
behind "Pretty Little Liars"

with us, the woman who
developed the series

and directed the finale along
with so many other episodes,

Marlene King is in the house!

[cheers and applause]

And looking fashionably fierce, too.

Thank you, well, these guys
taught me everything I know.

So we all just watched
the most epic finale ever.

Did you have this ending in mind?

And how long have you been planning it?

Well, definitely for years.

I didn't know sort of
scene by scene by scene

what it was going to be
like until a few months

before we started shooting it,

<i>even a few weeks for some things,</i>

but we knew who A.D. was, and who A.D.
was going to be,

and what the connections to all
the dots were going to be.

So for years, really.

I see, and for you, ladies,

what was your favorite
plot twist in the finale?

I would say Alex, yeah.

That was the ultimate plot twist.

<i>That was the biggest plot twist.</i>

As a writer, some of the fun
was convincing the audience

that Spencer was A.D.

for I think several acts
before then we realize

that wasn't Spencer at
all, that was Alex.

Did you guys ever, you know,

try to give her ideas with who A.D.
should be or...

Everybody has said to me...
everyone on this couch...

I don't know if Shay has said it,

but everybody else has said

that they wanted to be "A"
at some point in time.

I think everyone wanted...
No way!

I think every character...

Brendan...
Brendan.

<i>Everybody on the
show wanted to be "A."</i>

<i>Oh, Brendan.</i>

I's sort of the most
coveted role on the show.

Everybody wants to be either bad,

or A.D., or a combination of both.

Right.
And Lucy got to really have

a turn this year too

which I thought was really fun.

Marlene was so amazing and
gave me the best storyline

<i>I could have asked for so it was fun</i>

<i>to go to the bad side for a little bit,</i>

but she came around in the end, so.

You got to wear the hoodie.
I got to wear the hoodie.

That's all I wanted, yeah.

Also, can I just say
that was really fun?

Because I got to direct the episode.

After, okay.
Then you just come in after.

And then once he kind of
starts to chip away at that...

Just have him cross this out.

Yeah, and action.

It was so clear that I
guess you had been, like,

thinking about it for a while

because the second that I
put, like, the camera on her

<i>and I was like, "All right, go nuts,</i>

<i>I want to see what you do with this,"</i>

it was like she had made every choice.

I'd been preparing for many years.

And I've also never seen you so evil,

and I was like, "Yup, you got it."

Looking over the last seven
seasons, "Pretty Little Liars"

has tackled a lot of social issues.

Which do you think had the
most impact on your audience?

I think two... one of them

is just the whole idea of bullying.

Bullying online, and bullying at school.

I's so prevalent in society,

and the show tackles it
literally every episode.

And also sexuality,
Emily's coming out story.

People forget, seven years
ago it was still...

<i>and I think it still is now a big deal.</i>

<i>- It still is.
If you don't live</i>

on the East Coast or the West Coast,

you know, you're struggling.

And so I think we're all extremely proud

of giving a face to a young woman

who came out to her friends

<i>and was unconditionally
accepted by everyone.</i>

Have you had any stories
where fans have come up to you

and told you what "Pretty Little
Liars" has done for them?

Oh, my God, all the time.
Yeah, all the time.

All the time.
I've had older women

come up to me and saying

that they wished that the show was on

when they were in school,
you know, so that

they could've had somebody
that they would relate to

<i>and it's just really nice to know</i>

that as entertaining as our show is,

it also has that impact on their lives

in a very important way, yeah.

And I had... somebody sent me a letter

that I kept on my desk,
and I shared with you...

You brought it to me, yeah.
And everyone.

It was a transgender college student

who had tried to commit suicide

and when she came out of the hospital

all she had was "Pretty Little Liars"

and she binge-watched it and
came out of her depression.

Those kind of things are
so meaningful to us.

Wow, I know as a fan myself,

when I get to bond with other people

who have watched "Pretty Little Liars"

it brings you into this in-crowd

where you just understand
that it's a bond,

it's a sisterhood, it's a relatability

and it's an empathy for everybody

and what they're going through out there

and I love that "Pretty Little Liars"

brought that to everybody.

'Cause crazy as it is, I always say,

and I've always said it, it's
a story about friendship.

Well, I couldn't
have imagined this day

without you guys.

Let's take a selfie before
the photographer gets here.

Yeah.

I's a story about
unconditional friendship

between these five people...
Yes.

And that's what the
heart of the show is.

Aw, well, thank you
so much for joining us.

Now you can get back to
the rest of your party

while we get ready for
some more surprises.

Coming up next we have a
very special look back

at seven seasons of mystery and murder

that you're not gonna want to miss.

<i>â™ª</i>

I just want to say thank
you so much from the bottom

of my heart for supporting us

and this show for the past seven years.

You guys are the best fans and
honestly if it weren't for you

we wouldn't have been able to
have this amazing experience.

Thank you so much.

I hope you love the ending,
and, yeah, here we go.

Let's see whats coming up.

<i>â™ª</i>

When you're that young,
you're, like, 15 and someone

says they want to kill you,
like, I would tell my parents.

And also "A" was always
threatening to kill you.

Totally.

Welcome back to the
"Pretty Little Liars

A-List Wrap Party."

The series has come to an end,

so we're partying like
there's no tomorrow,

and we're giving the
girls their last chance

to reveal their secrets.

So, ladies, I want to know,
what was it like for you guys

when you first met each other?

<i>Like first impressions compared</i>

<i>to what you know of each other today?</i>

I remember thinking about Shay,

she's really glamorous and beautiful

and she's got great hair.
And she's so smart.

I don't know if a lot of
people know that about Shay.

She's so smart, and
worldly, and cultured.

And what I remember about
Troian is at the table read,

I was like, "I love her voice."

It was so, like, husky, and raspy.

And so that was my
first, initial reaction.

And she's just one of those
people that whatever she does,

she does it really well.

I's, like, annoying, but
awesome at the same time.

But Ashley and I go way back.

We met on MySpace when we were 15.

Get out!
Oh, my God, my mermaid hair.

What?
Your mermaid hair.

It was a beautiful photo.

And that horrible bikini.
You looked great.

Oh, my gosh, that's crazy.
What about for you, Troian?

What was your first
impression of the ladies?

My favorite actually
embarrassing story

about the first time
that I experienced Sasha

was we were in the bathroom
together and I assumed

that she was my age at the
time which was like...

I assumed she was a young 20s.
Yeah.

<i>I was, like, washing my
hand and I was like "God,</i>

"the way that you play Alison,

"you got that, like, mean girl,

that, like, middle school mean girl."

I was like, "You just
brought me back to,

like, being, like, 12, or
13 or something like that."

And I had no idea that
she was actually...

12.
Only 12.

It was 12.
Just turned 12.

And she was very polite about it

and she was like, "Oh,
thank you, I'm so..."

Wait.
But I just remember, like,

looking at her and being
like, yeah, like,

you've got this character down
and I didn't realize that

there was a 10-year age
difference between us.

That's crazy.
That's insane.

There's nobody else who
could've played Alison.

How?
Literally nobody.

We had the best Alison under the sun.

Aw, that's so sweet.
Thanks.

All right, so for you, Shay,
what's a funny memory you have

of these ladies when you first met them?

Funny memory I have is when
we shot the pilot in Vancouver.

I'm Canadian so I'm used to
the cold, and I just remember

looking at all of them with,
like, massive jackets on

<i>and to me I was like, "This
is a nice fall day."</i>

<i>- It was December.
I know it was,</i>

but for me it wast...

It was freezing cold.
That cold.

It was so cold.
Yes, it was.

We were outside fighting,

and it started snowing
and we were in bikinis.

No, for that scene, but I wast there.

She's asking my first impression
when I first saw you guys,

and we were walking to
Thanksgiving dinner.

So in my mind...

It was look at these
California bitches.

I was like, yeah,

they all have big jackets on and...

All right, so I want to
know, what would you guys do

if the things that happened

to your characters happened
to you in real life?

I would change my phone number,

<i>and I would've gone to the police.</i>

<i>And your parents. I
would've told my parents.</i>

If someone was harassing
me like that, I would 100%

tell my parents before it got that bad.

Sasha, for real, at
that young of an age...

For reals.

When you're getting random
text messages and somebody...

Totally, but I have
a close relationship

with my parents so maybe that's why.

I think anybody would
call the police ASAP.

Yeah, but, no, think about it.

At that age, when you're that young,

you're like 15 and someone says

they want to kill you? Like,
I would tell my parents.

And also, "A" was always
threatening to kill you.

Yeah, regular.

Like, those are the
messages to you is, like...

Totally.
They were really violent.

Or, like, Lucy, when
you were stuck in a box.

[panting and whimpering]


What would you do in real life?

I'm 100% certain I
could take anyone out.

I know I'm small, but I
feel like I could've...

<i>whoever put me in that box,</i>

<i>I feel like I could knock
them out in real life.</i>

I would find a way.
See?

I would never be put
in that position...

Well, it's true.
Because it would just never...

I also think we wouldn't have gone

in the forest as often as we did.

Yes, stop going in the woods.
You know, like, I think

I would've learned my lesson, yeah.

And stop going to the woods in heels.

In heels, like, quit
wearing your heels

running through the woods.
That's my new Instagram bio,

"Stop going into the woods with heels."

Now, with so many characters
being murdered in the show,

what was the most surprising death?

Which was something you
guys didn't expect?

In order to actually
surprise me on the show

it would have to be somebody
like Toby, or like Caleb,

or like Spencer, you know what I mean?

That would be actually shocking.

Is that the same for
all of you ladies, too?

I think I was still
shocked when my dad died,

that was kind of...
Yeah.

Oh, yeah I forgot your dad died.
That was sad.

Well, it happened in the jump, right?

Yeah, yeah.
What'd you say?

I forgot her dad died.
Ashle's like,

"Oh, yeah, I forgot your dad died."

Your dad died, yeah, yeah.

I think that was also the
thing, why it was never

so surprising whenever
anybody died on our show,

because they would just
come back for flashbacks.

Right.
Right.

You know what I mean? So
you knew when somebody died

you'd be talking to Ashley

and be like, "Oh, man, it
sucks that you're dying

but, like, now I'll
probably see you more."

Like, we saw Andrea way
more after Jessica died.

<i>- Totally, yeah.
You know?</i>

Yeah.
Because we did lose

so many beloved

and not so beloved
characters over the years,

we thought we should
take one last look back

at those who didn't make
it out of Rosewood alive.

This is our "Pretty Little
Liars" in memoriam.

<i>[somber pop music]</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª See your face</i>

<i>â™ª In front of me</i>

<i>â™ª Lost in love</i>

<i>â™ª And make believe</i>

<i>â™ª When we're close time stands still â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And all is silent</i>

<i>â™ª In your eyes I can see the truth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In the night as we stand
here and all is quiet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª These are the words
that are meant for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So hear me now</i>

<i>â™ª Fragile sounds of my heart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Beating loud for you to hear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª See me now</i>

<i>â™ª As a part of your dreams â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Before I'm gone and you won't see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Only when I see your eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The love so pure it shines so bright â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I know exactly why
I feel the way I do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Never leave</i>

<i>â™ª I heard you say</i>

When we come back I'm going
to be asking the questions

that you fans have been
dying to have answered.

So stick around, the
"Pretty Little Liars

A-List Wrap Party" has just started.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

I just wanted to say thank
you for supporting us.

Thank you for giving us

a reason to be together for seven years.

And I'm just super excited
to see what happens next.

I'm so, so happy that I will always,

always have this show to watch episode

after episode for seven seasons

and I can just go and
visit all my friends,

and that's all because of you.

<i>â™ª</i>

So we've had a lot of funny
moments, a lot of laughs,

a lot of like...
A lot of boob grabbing.

Boob grabbing, nipple grazing.

To each other.

There's boob grabbing on the set?

Welcome back, guys, we
were just talking about you.

Well, not you personally
but you fans in general

'cause "Pretty Little Liars" fans

are among the most passionate

and like to get very personal,
wouldn't you guys say?

Yeah.
So let's find out

what's some of their
most burning questions.

You guys ready for this?
both: Sure.

Okay, if you could've
changed one thing

about your characters what would it be,

and why would you change it?

Shay, you can go.
Yeah.

They all think that I'm
gonna say her wardrobe.

<i>- I'm not like Emily style-wise.
I think we know this.</i>

Seeing on Instagram you love a
good, pretty piece of fashion.

Definitely do. I don't really know

if there is much I would
change about Emily.

Really?
No.

I really do like how she was.

So if you were gonna
pick one item of clothing

that Emily could start
wearing, what would it be?

Heels.
Yeah, probably heels.

Yeah.
Okay, nice.

What about for you, Ashley?

Nothing.
Nothing at all?

No.
You loved your character

just the way she was?
Mm-hmm.

But that's, like, being
an actor, like, for me,

like, Acting 101 is not
judging the character.

I think when you judge and be
like, "Why was she doing that?"

you get... that's the wrong thing.

Ari's not me.

Although I would not act like Aria,

or do the decisions she made,

that's who she is, that's
how she's written.

You have to accept that, you know?

Troian, I feel like you're
very similar to Spencer

because Spencer is very intelligent

and I mean, those sides are the same.

Is there anything you would
have changed about Spencer?

No, I agree.

I really, I mean, there's...

I could not have said
it better than Lucy

and they are who they are...
Right.

And we feel lucky to
have portrayed them

for as long as we did.

Yeah, now who was your
favorite villain on "PLL"?

I mean, I love some old school Ali.

I was just gonna say the same thing.

<i>I really do.</i>

I think Ali's my favorite villain.

But Mona too, like, I love dark Mona.

<i>I love Mona and Radley,
you know, she's crazy.</i>

Yes.
And I love Alex.

I love Alex. I also love

when we thought that Spencer
was bad for a second,

and when she was in the insane
asylum that was interesting.

<i>Ooh, that was juicy.</i>

<i>You weren't really a villain.</i>

Felt very much "Girl Interrupted"

for you in those moments.
Yeah, I loved that.

What's one thing you ladies
will miss about one another?

One thing. I know there's a lot.

You guys have covered some
but what's the one thing?

For each person?
Yeah.

I would say, well, for
Troian she's the advice,

you know, go to her, and
also she explains words.

Like, we'd read a word and Ashley

and I would be like,
"Troian, what does it mean?"

No, you wouldn't.
She's the dictionary.

You guys would get
into a competition...

We would argue, we would.
About who was right about it,

and then you'd be like,
"Troian, what is that?"

And then all of a sudden
you guys would start,

like, hitting each other.
Yeah, I know.

You'd be like, "Got it
right, got it right."

Yeah, we would do that.
Troian's you're human Siri.

Yeah.
Ashley, I'm gonna miss

the uncomfortable
moments she puts you in

when she does her pranks and
jokes with the crew and cast.

I mean, one time she actually
made our hair person think

that she burned Ashley on the arm...

Oh, my God!
And I had to sit in it.

That's so wrong!
And I was so uncomfortable

because I knew she was joking

but, like, she just lets you sit in it

until it's uncomfortable.

And I'm like, "Okay, we need to tell her

that you're joking," you
know, and she just doesn't.

Ashley, that's evil.
Yeah.

I love it.
Luce,

I'm gonna miss your little...

she's, like, the most, best gift giver,

best, like, arts and crafts,

so, like, I always see her working

on something and every sing... you know,

she really does give the best gifts.

Aw, thanks.
And Sash, I mean,

my partner in this.

<i>We've had a lot of funny
moments, you know?</i>

<i>We have a lot of... a lot of laughs.</i>

A lot of laughs, a lot of, like...

A lot of boob grabbing.
Boob grabbing, nipple grazing.

Protecting each other. Yeah.

There's boob grabbing on the set?

Oh, yeah. No, no, no, in scenes.

In, like, our sex scenes and...

Oh, got it.

You know I'm here for you, right?

Why are you getting so sentimental?

I'm trying to create a vibe here,

and it definitely is not sweet.

I was just actually thinking,
like, the thing that

I'm gonna miss the most
is that on our set

I don't think I've ever laughed harder.

Like, there were just so
many moments at 3:00 a.m.

when I thought I was going to pass out

<i>if I had to run through the woods</i>

in my heels one more
time and then, like,

Ashley would say something
and I would literally just,

like, fall to the ground
in the wood chips

of the Warner Brothers back lot.

And I just don't... I don't feel like

I've ever had that much consistent fun.

I'm gonna miss going to work
and everyone has a good time,

but the second that camera rolls
everyone knows their lines.

Like, this is the most
fun group of girls,

<i>but also the most professional.</i>

There was never a moment where
I was like, "Oh, my God!

Why don't they know their lines?"

Or, "Why aren't they..." and
then the second someone

yells cut it's back to being goofy.

So it was the equal
amount of work and fun.

I can actually see
that here even today.

There's so much glam, obviously you guys

have to get dressed for the wrap party.

You ladies were on time.
Glam was wrapped,

outfits together, everybody in position.

I mean, you're very, very professional

and you guys know the drill.

You're amazing.

Which brings me to ask, do
you think you would be open

to a reunion years from
now, let's say, like,

a 10-year reunion show
or anything like that?

I would definitely
be open to a reunion

just 'cause I would
want to see everybody

and it would very much
depend on what it was for,

and what the characters

were gonna be doing next
and why we were doing it.

I mean, I would never want
to pass up an opportunity

to do that, you know what I mean?

But I think the great thing
about our friendship

is that I feel like I can
have that with the girls

with or without a reunion.

So I think the reunion
will have to be...

it would have to be pretty special

and I think we would all really want it

to be something that would be...

Yeah, meaningful.
Do it justice.

Yeah, to do it justice.
Right.

I don't feel like you ladies
would lose much touch anyway.

I can see that when you
guys have children,

or start a new company
I feel like you guys

would be there to support one another.

Yeah.
Well, don't kick off

your party shoes just yet

because we still have so much more fun

that you can't miss, guys.

You got to grab a snack but
come right back for more

of the "Pretty Little Liars
A-List After Party."

<i>â™ª</i> â™ª

I just want to thank you guys,

our fans for being with us
these last seven years.

I's been so crazy and
we wouldn't be able

to have done all these
seasons without you.

Your support means the world to us.

I's been so fun getting
to meet all of you guys

and seeing your feedback on Twitter,

and talking with you guys.

So thank you so much, we love you,

we wouldn't be here without you.

<i>â™ª</i>

Are there any secrets that
you could finally let out now?

Dirty secret.

Yeah, I'm so glad that
I can finally just,

like, air out all that dirty laundry.

Hey, you're back!

So we're just getting
into the juicy stuff.

I have a huge question for you guys.

I want to know, now that
the series is over,

are there any secrets that you guys

have kept from your family,
from your friends,

that you could finally let out now?

Dirty secrets.
Right.

Yeah, I'm so glad that
I can finally just,

like, air out all that dirty laundry.

Was there a moment that you
guys had to keep a secret

and it was so hard

whether it was your family asking you,

bothering you, your fans,
that you were like,

"Oh, I can't wait till
this just gets free"?

My family, like, learned
to quit asking me I think,

like, season two because...

Oh, really?
Yeah, they just quit asking

because they knew I couldn't.
Yeah, I mean,

and I think now everyone
knows the storyline

so we... it's been nice to
not have to keep anything.

Right.
What are secrets from the set

that most fans wouldn't know?

We hide our phones...
Insane asylum... yeah.

Like, we always...
like, they're all...

There's always a phone...
Around us right now.

We all have our phones here but, like...

Where's your phone, you guys?

Show it, where's your phone?

Mine is actually downstairs, so.

Really funny.

So, we hide them always.
Oh, nice.

You could have your real phone but...

Real phone in the scene,

<i>it's just our character's case.</i>

<i>Not mine.</i>

I had this, like, old 1999 cell phone

for the longest time.

All right, who is the
highest maintenance on set?

Who takes the longest to get ready?

Ian Harding.
The boys take forever.

<i>Wait, seriously?</i>

<i>They take forever to come
down, like, dressed...</i>

Yes.
What?

They take the longest to change.

They've got hair and socks

to worry about, what?

You'd be shocked.

And out of you guys here,

who would you say is gonna
be the most on time?

I'm always late.
I'm always five minutes late

because I always have to get coffee.

And who's lowest maintenance

if there wasn't glam, God forbid?

Who would be like, "That's
fine, let's shoot"?

Probably Troian. Or Ashley, yeah.

Oh, for real?

Oh, but you need your
coffee and you're good?

Mm-hmm.
So over the last seven years

what has fan support meant to you?

You guys have seen it change

and grow to a huge,
unbelievable amount today.

What has it meant for you
in your personal life?

I think because it's been
so huge internationally

it's cool for me cause my
family's in South Africa

and so that's how my family

sees me is, you know, through the show.

And just the fact... I
saw the other day, like,

our show is in the top five shows

almost in every country.

Yeah, that's crazy.
Wow.

Which is mind-blowing. Mind-blowing.

Yeah.
And I think you only

kind of realize that when you get out

because we're always
shooting on a sound stage.

You don't really know

how other people are
reacting to the show,

and you really notice
that when you travel

and you go abroad and you realize

that it's really globally successful.

I's crazy.
Yeah.

Wow.
And they're so into it.

They're little investigators
and, like, they know more...

Brazil. Brazil?
About our show than we do.

When we went to Brazil?
Oh, my gosh, yes.

My favorite story about
Shay is, you know,

this was very... this
was, like, season two.

Season two.
We got off the plane

and there were hundreds
of little girls there

and I was like, "Oh,
my God, who is here?

Like, someone really famous is here."

both: We were so excited.

Someone here is, like...
And then we realized,

oh, like, they were there to see us

and I had never experienced that.

I still haven't experienced anything

like that since then, so.
No, no.

Both: Lucy, Shay, come down!

That's... they would
yell that from the hotel.

Oh!
It was funny.

That was a fun trip.
That's so sweet, aw.

Any memorable fan gifts that
you've gotten, or letters?

I think tattoos on bodies.
Yes.

I think there's a guy that
has all of our faces tattooed.

There's a guy that
has all of our faces.

Who we met.
Yeah, who we met.

I met in Germany and
he had my face first...

Yeah, I met him...
And then slowly but surely.

At a BeyoncÃ© concert
and he has everybody's

And he has all of our faces.

Yeah.
That's some dedication.

Yeah.

I don't know who the artist was,

but they actually are great.

They look pretty good.
They did a good job?

They did a really good job.

Yeah, you wouldn't want your bad side

on this person's arm forever.
No, right.

That's good.
Yeah.

They're just amazing,
they're really supportive.

Well, because you fans are so special

we wanted to give you one
last chance to say good-bye,

so let's take a look
at our fan farewells.

All: We're "Pretty Little
Liars" biggest fans!

There's so much that I'm
gonna miss about the show.

The girls' fashion,

all the friendships, being
a little bit afraid

every time I got a text message

because what if it was from "A"?

What we're gonna miss most
of all is live tweeting

with all the other "Pretty
Little Liars" fans.

Thank you for seven years
of just pure enjoyment,

and laughter, and hysterical crying.

Emily's coming out was one
of my favorite storylines

because it helped me deal
with my own struggles.

How lucky am I to have a show

that makes saying good-bye so hard?

This is Anne from Mexico,

and I have the most amazing memories

from live-tweeting with the cast,

the crew, all the fans.

Through all seven seasons
there's never a dull moment.

As dedicated fans,

we'll miss seeing you
all on the screens.

I's so hard to make
something so special

to so many people, but you did it,

and it was awesome, so congratulations.

Thank you to the cast and
crew of "Pretty Little Liars"

for making my Tuesday nights amazing.

Thank you, and farewell, my friends.

Thank you for everything.

I love you all to death.
Thank you.

Congratulations on a wonderful show.

We'll miss you.
both: We love you!

Thanks for the wonderful memories,

"Pretty Little Liars."

all: Shh!

Hello, you pretty little liars.

I's me, Eric Stonestreet, here,

saying congratulations on seven years

of such a fun show that
so many people enjoyed.

I'm gonna miss it.
Hey, what's up?

I'm Adrienne Houghton from "The Real"

and I am such a huge fan
of "Pretty Little Liars."

You guys keep me at the
edge of my seat every week.

Congratulations, "Pretty Little Liars"

on seven seasons.
We will miss you.

Since it's the final season
of "Pretty Little Liars"

I'm really gonna miss running home

to watch the final episode.

Both: Congratulations,
"Pretty Little Liars,"

on seven seasons, we'll miss you.

And I wish you all the best,

you pretty little liars, you.

<i>â™ª</i>

This has been a great
night, and I'm sorry to say

that the party and the
series really is over.

I can't believe I'm saying that.

Now it's time for all of us
to say good-bye to the show

that has kept us guessing,
and gasping, and texting,

and tweeting for seven
unforgettable seasons.

From the cast and crew of
"Pretty Little Liars,"

thanks for coming to our
"A-List Wrap Party,"

and remember, two can keep a secret

if one of them is dead.

Good night, everybody,

Ladies, congratulations. Cheers.

All: Cheers.

Cheers.
