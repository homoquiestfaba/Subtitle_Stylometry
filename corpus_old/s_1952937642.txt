Please...                       

Hi, Mrs. Liebman.       

Alan, you're late for dinner again.              

Your father is home already.                

You with your baseball game.                  

Mom, stick ball.        

Stick ball even sounds         
like a game for hoodlums.       

Go change for dinner.           

I'm leaving you, Ruthie.    

Oh, I wish you'd stay.          

I'm leaving you, too.     

Why don't you stay?             

You have a family.          

You have a supper.          

Take something with you.        

I'll give you such a punch.         

Oh, don't you dare.             

Goodbye, sweetie.       

I'll call you later.            

Alan, come say goodbye to
Mrs. Liebman.                

She's leaving.                  

<i>Goodbye to Mrs. Liebman.</i>       

<i>She's leaving.</i>        

<i>Goodbye, Alan.</i>        

<i>Wanna say that again, condello?</i>              

<i>What is this?</i>         

<i>Mom!</i>             

<i>Charles atlas, huh?</i>      

<i>Alan, what do you</i>          
<i>want with muscles.</i>         

<i>A muscle is just a</i>         
<i>...muscle, huh?</i>        

<i>Character should be strong.</i>          

<i>Look at president Roosevelt,</i> 
<i>for goodness sake.</i>         

<i>He's a giant among men,</i>    
<i>yet he's in a wheelchair,</i>      

<i>Shriveled from the waist down.</i>     

Oh, thanks, mom.                

<i>Now I feel a whole lot better.</i>             

<i>Come into dinner.</i>          

<i>Oh, and your father's</i>     
<i>upset about the war, so...</i>

Only George Patton and his

the German border.             

<i>[ father: ]</i>

Eisenhower isn't thinking.      

He advanced too fast.           

<i>[ Alan: ] sorry I'm late, pop.</i>      

<i>Hey, ma, what's for dinner?</i>          

Soup, chicken and       
whatever else I give you.   

I'd eat bread and water           

if only we could win this war already.     

Tomorrow night -- bread and water.        

Dinner's on the table.         

Let's eat.

[ mother: ] <i>Alan,</i>             
<i>turn off the radio.</i>         

Why?              

I have something to say.        

I don't want to be interrupted
until I'm finished. 

What is it, Ruth?       

Problems with the super again?        

Oh, no, it's nothing like that.         

Look, Sol, you got your coffee.            

Alan, there's your milk.        

We have marble cake.            

Day old, but it's good.         

I am going to talk         
and you are going to listen.    

Dessert in the living room?         

Yes, but you have to let
me finish to the end!    

You haven't said anything.         

If you begin, then maybe    
we can let you finish.     

Oh, all right.                  

Now you both know              
Mrs. Kirschenbaum               

and her daughter Naomi.         

Living across the way with Mrs. Liebman?            

<i>[ Alan: ] the crazy girl?</i>        

Who are you?                    

Dr. Freud?                      

She's not crazy!                

They went through plenty.       

That child, Naomi --             

her father was killed by the Nazis         

right in front of her eyes.     

<i>All right, Ruth, we know what kind</i>          

<i>Of ugly things the Nazis do.</i>         

Well, she needs help.           

<i>I think it was a mistake<i>        
<i>to bring her here</i>              

<i>I mean, I'm sorry, Sol, this</i> 
<i>is not a very good neighborhood.</i>

<i>I wish we could afford better.</i>        

Sol, I am not blaming you!      

<i>Well, forgive me for just working</i>       

<i>In the department of records.</i>          

<i>I'm sorry I'm not</i>

<i>Alan, where are you going?</i>     

I gotta do my homework.         

<i>Sit.</i>             

Hear me out.          

Now, before this girl          
can go to school again,         

the doctor says she has        
to learn to trust again.        

This girl need friends.         

Nice children.                  

Children her own age.           

No!                 

<i>Alan, have I asked you?</i>               

Yes!              

And she's a crazy girl          

Alan, don't take that     
tone with your mother.     

<i>[ mother: ] Alan, it's nothing.</i>             

It's simple.                    

You just go over            
once a day after school.        

An hour, half hour.             

You go over and you just sit.   

<i>I won't! I can't!</i>          

<i>I'd miss stick ball.</i>     

<i>Again with the farichta stick ball.</i>     

[ Alan: ] Mom, do you know how
many of the guys'd call me sissy     

if they found out I was hangin' 
out with some crazy girl?   

I mean, I've got one friend     
on this whole block         

and he'd quit on me if he found out.               

<i>[ father: ]</i>           
<i>Alan, let's talk about this.</i>          

<i>I won't!</i>           

<i>And that's final!</i>          

<i>[ mother: ] Alan!</i>             

[ door slams ]                  

<i>[ knock, knock ]</i>       

<i>[ father: ] Hey, Alan.</i>             

It's not fair.                  

You can't make me do this.      

<i>Alan, we can't make you</i>    
<i>do this, you're right.</i>    

<i>It isn't fair.</i>        

<i>And, besides, this thing</i>   
<i>is very delicate,</i>          

<i>Like a surgical operation.</i>             

<i>Who would use a surgeon</i>    
<i>who hates what he's doing?</i>     

<i>He could cut off</i>       
<i>your nose, your ears,</i>     

<i>even your whole head!</i>     

<i>Brrrrpppttt!</i>         

<i>Like that.</i>             

<i>But...</i>            

<i>Allow me one "but".</i>      

<i>In our life --</i>         

<i>Alan, sometimes</i>        
<i>when we're young,</i>          

<i>sometimes when we're old --</i>       

<i>in our life, once or twice</i>         

<i>we're called upon</i>          
<i>to do something</i>        

<i>that we can't do</i>       
<i>or we don't wanna do,</i>     

<i>that we won't do...</i>      

<i>but we do it.</i>         

Well, I won't.                  

<i>Alan, you've asked me</i>     
<i>more than once,</i>        

<i>how can God allow the Nazis?</i>       

<i>It's like asking</i>       
<i>why do people die.</i>         

<i>You say you</i>          
<i>don't believe in God.</i>     

<i>Well, sometimes God finds you</i>         

<i>when you least expect it.</i>       

<i>I won't ask you to do</i>     
<i>anything you can't do.</i>    

<i>Just think about it;</i>     
<i>that's all I ask.</i>          

Why does it have to be me?      

<i>Maybe because you're</i>     
<i>one of the lucky ones.</i>    

[ knock, knock ]        

Enough philosophy.          

I have to tell Mrs. Liebman something.    

<i>[ father: ] tell her we'll have</i>         

<i>an answer for her tomorrow.</i>       

I hope you know what you're doing.          

If I knew what I was doing,     
I'd be president Roosevelt.     

Then again, Roosevelt 
has a very smart wife.          

She says, "president, darling,  
maybe you should do this.       

"president, darling,            
maybe you should do that."      

She doesn't put a gun to his head.              

Fine, you become president,     
I'll put my gun away.     

In the meantime, I still    
don't have an answer.     

[ Shaun: ] hey, al!                       

What we gotta do is bring       
the outfielder further in, see? 

That way we can catch       
Condello's old blooper shots.   

I call it "the Kelly shift."    

Hey, Silverman, are you listening?              

What do ya think of the plan,          

for crying out loud?      

The plan?                       

<i>The Kelly shift.</i>       

<i>Listen, Shaun,</i>            
<i>I forgot to tell you...</i>         

 <i>I can't play in the game today.</i>              

<i>What?</i>             

<i>Well I-I got an errand to do.</i>                

<i>Who's gonna catch</i>          
<i>all my pop shots?</i>          

You could get Tony.             

It's only for today.            

<i>What's the big deal -- errand?</i>          

<i>Can't you do it after the game?</i>        

<i>Get outta here!</i>        

<i>No, I gotta do it by four,</i>                  

then I got homework after.      

<i>Terrific!</i>              

<i>You wanna be first in the class.</i>         

<i>That's one of the</i>          
<i>worst things about you.</i>    

<i>I don't care if I'm first.</i>                   

One of the worst?               

What else?                      

<i>Huh?</i>             

<i>Come on, what else<i>             
<i>is bad about me?</i>              

<i>Well, some of the guys</i>    
<i>think you're yellow.</i>     

<i>I don't, but they do.</i>         

<i>What're you gonna do --</i>    
<i>beat 'em up?</i>

<i>I really wanna know.</i>          

It won't hurt me.       

[ bell rings ]

<i>Nothin'.</i>           

Come on!                        

<i>Well, maybe you're</i>         
<i>a little prejudiced.</i>     

Me?                             

<i>Yeah, like against</i>         
<i>girls and stuff.</i>       

 <i>Like all those dirty jokes</i>     
<i>you tell about them.</i>

<i>a girlfriend or something?</i>      

<i>Are you kiddin'?</i>       

Better not.                     

[ Shaun: ] I ain't hangin' around          
with no sissies,

<i>Oh, hello.</i>

You are such a good boy.        

You're a kind boy.              

<i>I can't say enough from my heart.</i>               

Thank you.                      

<i>An apple?</i>              

<i>A banana?</i>              

<i>Huh?</i>             

No, really, Mrs. Liebman.        

<i>Maybe I'll be hungry another time.</i>                  

<i>Alan, this is Mrs. Kirschenbaum,<i>
<i>Naomi's mother.</i>        

This is the boy.                

<i>Merci.</i>            

<i>Merci bien, Alan.</i>          

<i>Merci, Alan.</i>

<i>First, Alan, I want</i>      
<i>you should understand</i>     

<i>that in Switzerland,</i>     

<i>after they got away</i>      
<i>from the Nazis,</i>        

<i>Naomi was very sick,</i>     
<i>but she got better.</i>      

Much better.          

<i>She studied at home, by herself.</i>             

<i>She's very, very smart girl.</i>        

Now, however, she's somewhere else      

most of the time,       

and we want that she      
should wake up from it.    

Oy gott, gott, gott.      

<i>You understand?</i>        

<i>Now, come.</i>             

<i>No?</i>              

<i>Here.</i>             

<i>Come with me.</i>         

<i>It's important, dear,</i>     

<i>that you shouldn't</i>         
<i>move too quickly.</i>          

<i>You shouldn't get too close.</i>        

<i> You shouldn't make loud noises</i>       

<i>because it frightens her.</i>        

<i>Yeah? You understand?</i>

<i>I don't blame you</i>          
<i>for not looking at me.</i>    

<i>I think I scared you pretty bad<i> 
<i>in the hallway yesterday.</i>      

<i>Most people don't think</i>

<i>But, I mean,</i>         
<i>not-not in the stairwell</i>   

<i>when girls are</i>        
<i>on the floor and all.</i>     

<i>I hear your name's Naomi.</i>         

Mine's Alan --         

Alan Drucker Silverman.    

Actually, I've never told   
anyone my middle name before. 

I always thought they might laugh,       

but you don't laugh.      

It's my mother's maiden name. 

It's German.          

I mean, I mean, the good Germans --          

<i>Not the Gestapo Germans.</i>        

<i>The Jewish Germans.</i>      

<i>It means "printer" in German.</i>             

<i>You know, like someone</i>    
<i>who prints paper.</i>          

<i>Not unlike the paper</i>     
<i>you're tearing right there.</i>  

<i>Which, I mean, it's fine</i>   
<i>that you're tearin' paper.</i>     

<i>It-it looks very... relaxing.</i>

Good grief.

Eisenhower arrived for a firsthand look.           

In the general's own words,   
"it's still a long, hard road,  

but this is the payoff."       

<i>Now the hopes</i>

Stick ball!                     

Somethin's bothering you.       

What is it?                     

You can't tell me?              

What's the deal then?           

Is it condello?                 

<i>You know I'll take</i>

<i>I don't need you</i>       
<i>to fight my battles for me.</i>

<i>I can't tell you.</i>          

<i>Look, if you don't</i>

<i>Can't I take a day off?</i>    

<i>I mean, I think</i>

<i>Once in a million years.</i>   

<i>So you may,</i>          
<i>but you could at least</i>    

<i>let us know about it first, yes?</i>     

<i>Across the way, they were<i>   
<i>waiting for you as usual.</i>      

<i>If I'd a-told you,</i>         
<i>you wouldn't let me go,</i>    

<i>and you would've started in</i>

<i>that I wasn't born</i>         
<i>in Berlin, Germany,</i>      

<i>right next to Hein rich Himmler!</i>     

[ pots rattle ]                 

I'm sorry.              

That was a  stupid thing to say.      

I didn't mean it.       

We have to hear him, Ruth.      

We've put too much pressure.          

All right.                      

So, you took the afternoon off  
and you didn't tell us.     

Ten years in the clink         
on water and stale bread.       

Are you turning this into a joke, Sol?       

We can't tell him          
that if he takes a day off      

Someone may lose the battle.    

He's not a soldier.             

 He's just Alan, plain and simple.               

Taking a day off          
is his constitutional right.    

Fine.             

And what, may I ask,      

was our upstanding          
American citizen doing?    

I was playing stick ball, okay?       

It's a Miracle I haven't already been     

thrown off the team!      

I've missed every game this week!     

<i>[ mother: ] he's your son,</i>

<i>But he's got</i>               
<i>his mother's temper!</i>

<i>General Eisenhower himself<i>      
<i>would think twice</i>          

<i>before locking horns</i>         
<i>with you two Silvermans.</i>        

Alan, listen to your father.    

<i>You're much more</i>          
<i>than a stick ball player.</i>       

<i>If you were only a stick ball</i> 
<i>player, I wouldn't even bother,</i> 

But you're a person.            

A mensch.

<i>with a crazy girl?!</i>         

<i>You can't even get mad at her!</i>        

You're not allowed because she's crazy!      

And you feel crazy, too,    
because you do crazy things     

To keep her from being crazy!       

And it doesn't work!      

Nothing works!         

Alan...                         

You are my son and I am your father,           

and as your father,        
I forgive you ten times over    

for playing stick ball.         

So I hope that, as my son,      

you'll forgive me five times    
over for telling you now      

that I expect you to eat the cold chicken

<i>Why you so sad?</i>        

<i>Porquoi?</i>           

<i>Please, Jacques,</i>       
<i>do not be crying.</i>          

<i>Do not cry because of me.</i>        

[ Alan: ]   I'm not crying.                 

<i>Just lost my head for a minute.</i>                 

<i>You are so silly, monsieur Jacques.</i>          

I like the way you say my name, miss.              

It makes me seem a lot         
nicer than I really am.         

<i>Oh, no, no.</i>          

<i>You are a very nice person.</i>          

Very, very nice.        

I'm - I'm really happy to know    
that you speak English.         

<i>Yes, I have to do</i>          
<i>English for a time,</i>         

<i>But she is still</i>       
<i>not very excellent.</i>         

Oh, no, she-she is.                     

She's-she's good.               

The only place they wouldn't    
understand you is Texas,      

<i>But you can</i>                  
<i>learn that easy.</i>                

<i>All you have</i>              
<i>to know is "howdy do."</i>          

Haowdee doo.          

Now all you need is a          
ten gallon hat, Naomi.          

Naomi?             

There is no Naomi.           

Who is that?          

There is only me.

<i>What?</i>             

<i>Why not?</i>           

<i>What's goin' on?</i>

<i>takes place around Easter.</i>      

<i>It's for all the ancient</i>

<i>I go to my grandparent's house.</i>            

<i>My grandfather's in Ireland.</i>          

<i>I've never seen him.</i>     

<i>Maybe sometime you could</i>

<i>That's some nothing,</i>     

<i>But since you say it's nothing,</i>          

<i>I'm relieved, because there is something</i>         

<i>that I have to talk to you about.</i>     

What?!             

Your mother's afraid to ask you 
to do a certain something.    

She's afraid of your explosions.             

I don't explode!        

Yeah, I'm glad you've      
inherited your mother's temper. 

 It's good, it's healthy.                   

Like an apple a day,          
it keeps the doctor away,       

and once in awhile,         
everyone else as well.     

So what was                
the certain something           

You wanted to talk to me about?            

Ah, yes, the something.    

Alan, there's this doctor,      

And the doctor sees Naomi once a week.    

They discuss how she's coming along,         

what should be done next...        

that sort of thing, you know?           

[ Alan: ] no.                         

I mean, I-I didn't know.                

Well, anyway, they've     
discussed this business    

of your puppet talking to her doll.      

It's a dummy, not a puppet.                   

I'm a dummy when it comes to dummies.      

Anyway, they've all agreed,         

and the doctor said herself,  
that you did a terrific job!  

Naomi trusts you now.     

That's, uh, that's terrific.        

The word "terrific,"      

Mrs. Liebman told your mother,       

 is exactly the word the doctor used.        

What comes after terrific, however, is this --          

Naomi must not get          
too dependent on that doll.     

She can't use that doll as a crutch.          

You understand?                 

<i>[ Alan: ] I thought I was supposed</i>    
<i>to be so terrific.</i>         

<i>Absolutely... As a first step.</i>                

<i>But now she's got</i>            
<i>to take another step,</i>           

and you have to help.           

<i>You have to begin</i>         
<i>to talk to her, the person--</i>    

Naomi Kirshenbaum.             

Direct.                         

<i>I can't, dad!</i>         

<i>She-she won't talk</i>         
<i>without her doll.</i>          

<i>I've tried it.</i>        

You have to try again.          

Oh, sure, so I have to do everything.       

They should pay me          
instead of that doctor!    

<i>Alan, that's not you talking.</i>         

I'm doing all the work!    

The doctor's doing plenty       
of work, believe me,          

and in case you want           
to know, it's for free.         

 And if the doctor says         
you stop with the dummy,        

then you stop with the dummy already!         

She's scared to death without her doll!       

You should see her, dad!    

I can't do it!         

Let the doctor do it!     

Let the doctor risk losing friends!      

Let the doctor miss stick ball!        

What is this?                   

The fourth of July?!            

Such a tummel!                  

I wish I had never met Naomi.        

<i>I wish I had never met her!</i>         

<i>[ door slams ]</i>        

[ paper tearing ]               

Yvette...           

I can't see you,        

but I can feel you          
with my cowboy heart.     

<i>Please come out, Yvette.</i>            

<i>Once again, I have to apologize</i>         

<i>For my clumsy friend, Alan.</i>         

<i>When he told me that --</i>         

<i>that he pretended</i>          
<i>not to know you</i>        

On the staircase yesterday           

and that-that he let      
his friend make fun of you      

right in front of your own eyes,       

I almost rode off into     
the sunset in shame.      

Naomi,             

I'm so sorry.         

I didn't mean to hurt you.          

I wouldn't hurt you for the world.         

Naomi is disappeared.           

She is disappeared.             

There is no Naomi.              

There is only me --              

Yvette.                         

<i>Naomi, please talk to me, Naomi.</i>         

<i>There is no Naomi.</i>         

 [ whispers ]          
<i>Naomi, please.</i>        

<i>Non!</i>             

<i>Mama!</i>             

<i>Mama!</i>             

<i>Mama!</i>

Ous est, Yvette?        

Ous est tu?             

She's right here, Naomi.             

I'll put her where she's okay.       

Jack's taking good care of her.       

Naomi...            

<i>I'm so sorry I hurt you.</i>             

I'll never do it again.          

I promise, Naomi.             

I wanna help you, not hurt you.         

You're my friend, Naomi.             

My very special friend.        

Now please, Naomi...      

Let me help you.        

<i>Can you hear me,</i>       
<i>Naomi?</i>

Naomi.             

Oui,... Alan.          

[ whispers ] oui, Alan.                     

<i>[ mother: ] Sol, are you cooking those</i>

<i>Masterpieces</i>              
<i>can't be rushed, Ruth.</i>          

<i>Just watch, Alan.</i>          

<i>When he's finally finished,</i>          

<i>He'll tell us his omelet</i>   
<i>is too gorgeous to eat.</i>    

<i>Then we'll all</i>        
<i>have to "ooh"  and "ah"</i>    

<i>Until we're finally allowed</i>  
<i>to take our first bite.</i>    

<i>Ma, do you ever think</i>     
<i>we could adopt Naomi?</i>     

<i>What a question.</i>       

<i>She already has a mother.</i>                   

What does she need              
with two mothers?               

<i>Well, she doesn't have a father,</i>        

<i>and she could use</i>          
<i>a super-duper mother</i>     

<i>and father like you two.</i>         

<i>Sol, are you hearing this?</i>                   

<i>All of a sudden</i>               
<i>we're super-duper.</i>              

<i>So, what else is new?</i>     

<i>That boy --</i>             

<i>Sometimes he is such</i>     
<i>a pain in the tuchis.</i>     

<i>Sometimes...</i>         

<i>What's the surprise, huh?</i>        

<i>He's his father's son.</i>    

[ doorbell ]                    

Oh...                           

They're here already.     

How do I look?         

How do you look?                

You look like a boy.            

Pop, umm, don't talk about the war.         

And mom, remember, anything you do,        

don't get too close to her.       

And don't make any          
hysterical, loud noises.    

And don't make any fast,    
sudden, harsh movements.    

Well, so much for my super-duper.         

Hello, sweetie.                 

Hello, Mrs. Liebman.      

Hello.                          

Mmmm, is this Sol's cooking?     

Hi, Naomi.              

Hi.                 

Hello, Ruthie.         

Welcome, Naomi.                 

I'm Alan's mother.              

Oh... Merci.                     

[ speaking French ]         

Breakfast will be ready         
in just a moment.               

Alan, would you show           
Naomi around the house?         

[ kisses ]              

It's a good house.              

I mean, it's not great, but it's okay.              

My mom's always cleaning everything,            

So it looks better than it really is.              

Nice house.             

You wanna see my room, hmm?               

I would like.         

Come on, I'll show you all my stuff.

<i>Now I see what you see.</i>         

<i>May I?</i>            

Sure.                           

I built it.                     

Yeah, it flies.                 

Oh, sure.           

Yeah.                           

<i>It's nice.</i>

<i>Ooh.</i>             

<i>It's very nice.</i>        

<i>Oh, what's this?</i>       

It's a trumpet.

<i>Yes?</i>             

<i>Come for some omelets.</i>

<i>Oh, nothing much --  just an errand.</i>               

<i>That's you- secret Silverman.</i>          

<i>Everything's always got</i>

<i>Go on to Mrs. Landley.</i>

please tell us a few words      

to our terrified audience?

<i>You don't have to be afraid.</i>         

<i>[ monster: ]</i>         
<i>and now for some headlights</i>     
<i>with salt and pepper!</i>     

<i>And I love your street lights!</i>

just as soon as you get there. 

There's no telephone there.     

It's just a big field.     

Thank you, Charles Lindbergh.              

Then go and find a pharmacy,    
maybe, or a candy store.      

Okay, okay.             

All right.              

Say goodbye to Mrs. Liebman.

And don't you dare let her out

Trust me.           

Make sure you're back     
by 4:30 on the dot.         

Have a wonderful time, huh?              

[ Alan: ] well, this is it.               

It's not really an airport anymore,             

but it's still my favorite place.              

But, where are the planes?     

Uh, well, they're all gone,               

<i>but this used to be the</i>      
<i>biggest airport in new York.</i>    

<i>[ Alan: ] ...2, 3, 4, 5, 6...</i>

Alan, look, Alan, I am faster.          

Alan!             

[ laughing ]          

You should give it a name.      

Like what?              

Sorry.             

Umm, oiseau jaune.              

Okay, what does that mean?        

Hmm, yellow bird.               

Yes, call it "the yellow bird."              

All right, but Shaun...          

Well, I don't care.         

I just won't tell him.        

Shaun?                          

Your friend on the stairs?      

"here comes crazy cat."         

Oh, Alan, I don't care.         

I don't care.                   

You know, he says things,        

but he doesn't mean 'em.       

He really is a great guy.          

I am crazy, you know.           

<i>No, you're not.</i>        

<i>There's nothing wrong with ya.</i>        

No...                           

<i>I killed my father, you know?</i>                 

<i>I thought he was killed by the Nazis.</i>     

I helped them, you see?         

I killed him with the maps!     

You see? The maps!              

<i>He said we had</i>            
<i>to tear up all the maps.</i>        

My father made all the maps.    

Maps of the sewers.             

<i>Naomi, it's okay.</i>          

[ crashing noises ]         

Naomi, it wasn't your fault.             

It was the Nazis.       

Look...                         

My hands are clean.             

My dress is clean.              

And he's dead.                  

That's all.                     

[ speaking French ]             

Don't be afraid anymore, Naomi.        

No one's going to hurt you.          

Don't be afraid, all right?              

Okay?             

Okay.             

Shaun, I need to talk to you.        

Talk?             

I oughta beat your brains out.        

For crying out loud, Shaun,     
just listen for a minute.      

Let me explain.                 

Okay, Silverman,        
you've got one minute.     

My parents made me do it, Shaun.           

There's something wrong with her.                

Are you kidding?        

You pretended not to know her.        

You said your errand wasn't important.       

Why didn't you trust me?    

I don't know.         

I guess I was afraid.         

I was afraid you        
wouldn't like me anymore    

because every guy who     
hangs out with a girl,     

you call 'em a sissy.     

And this isn't just any girl --        

This is a girl we made fun of.        

This is crazy cat.          

Shaun, don't you understand?     

What's with you, Silverman?                      

She seemed crazy, that's all.                     

And don't you know              
when I'm kidding?              

Besides, you could've told      
me what was wrong with her,     

But no, you had to lie!                 

You're right.         

I was wrong.          

And I'm really sorry, Shaun.         

Well, I'm not.                  

I'm glad I found out about you.          

Look, from now on I'm gonna     
stay outta your way, okay?      

<i>And don't worry --</i>        
<i>I never called her "crazy cat"</i>  

To no one else.                 

<i>I just said that to you because I thought --</i>          

<i>I thought I could</i>             
<i>say anything to you</i>             

<i>because we were like --</i>    
<i>like brothers almost.</i>     

<i>So just stay outta my way</i>      
<i>and I'll stay outta yours.</i>     

<i>Okay?! Deal.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>She's so happy.</i>        

Such good news.        

Is she in all my classes?       

Sure!             

The principal we went to see twice.          

Everything is prepared, ya.         

You should be proud.      

Yes, it's because of you, your help.          

Yes.              

God sees everything.      

Your name will be inscribed     
in the book of life.      

I believe.              

I believe.              

I believe.              

Good morning, Mrs. Landley.         

This is Naomi Kirshenbaum.         

[ Mrs. Landley: ]  people.                   

People!                         

We have a new member            
in our class today.             

She's a wonderful girl          
<i>from Paris, France.</i>           

Her name is Naomi.              

I may mispronounce this --   

Naomi Kirshenbaum, right?      

Now, class, let's give     
Naomi a big welcome         

in her native tongue.     

Bien venue, Naomi.          

[ class: ] bien venue, Naomi.              

Again, class.         

[ class: ] bien venue, Naomi.              

[ Mrs. Landley: ] now, class, where              
were we yesterday?              

Let me think.                   

Voila.             

I am finished.         

Now I read yours first, okay?          

Alan, you're writing      
looks like a dizzy spider   

Crawled through some ink    
and jumped on your page.    

I have an unshal...         

Unusual.                        

Unshal.            

Unusual.                        

Unshal neighbor.        

Alan, you write about me    
for the assignment?         

Her name is Naomi Cherrytree.       

You are very crazy.         

She is short and fat, has purpled hair.       

Curly, pur...         

Purple hair, curly polka dot ears.     

And she never needs to worry         

about a costume for Halloween.         

You are a cabbage.          

A silly American cabbage.       

Oh, no.                         

Read, cabbage.                  

I first meet Alan Silverman     
in the hallway.           

 I was so afraid of him very much                

Because he carries a stick.     

I am afraid of sticks.          

I am afraid much times.         

But I am now his friend    
and I am now not afraid anymore.

In France is a word -- ami de core.                

De couer.           

Ami de couer.         

Ami de coe.                     

Couer.             

A good friend.                  

A friend from the heart.        

This is beautiful, Naomi.       

Read, cabbage.                  

If I had a brother, I would     
like he should be like Alan     

Because a brother           
should be kind and funny.       

Alan is very good at many things.                

Oh, but this is nothing.        

What is best -- Alan makes me laugh             

When I am crying inside myself.                 

Alan is very like my father,    

And he brings my hope back to me.             

That is the end of my essay.    

You're terrible, cabbage.            

I write nice...  what I feel.          

Well, this is just my silly version.              

I'll write a good one tonight.             

Poodle brain.                   

Poodle?            

You said poodle?        

That's funny.         

This was a word        
you said the first day     

you came into our house.    

It was?                         

Oh, yeah.           

Umm, poodle, Eiffel tower,         

Can-can in gay Parie.         

I didn't know you heard me.                   

Of course.              

I have much excellent ears.        

But, my favorite is how you sing to me.     

You liked my singing?           

<i>"FrÃ¨re Jacques"</i>        
<i>was my favorite song</i>     

<i>my father sings to me.</i>    

<i>He had a soft</i>         
<i>voice like you.</i>        

<i>A sweet voice.</i>        

<i>He would rock me</i>       
<i>and sing to me...</i>          

[ softly ] â™ª FrÃ¨re Jacques,      
<i>frÃ¨re Jacques. â™ª</i>           

<i>And I was safe.</i>        

<i>I was safe.</i>          

<i>Hey, whaddaya know?</i>        

<i>Sweetheart Jews!</i>       

<i>Hey, I hear</i>                
<i>you two are married.</i>            

<i>Is that right, Silverman?</i>                   

Kissy, kissy.                   

[ shouting ]          

Run, Naomi!             

Run!              

<i>[ smack ]</i>              

<i>[ scream ]</i>             

<i>Condello, watch the birdie!</i>          

Hey, stop it!                   

I didn't mean nothin'!          

<i>I didn't mean nothin'!</i>                   

[ bell rings ]         

I guess I do need you     
to help me fight my battles.  

Well, we're a good team, al.    

You can't go home like that.    

You're all covered with blood.  

Lose any teeth?                 

No.                 

Jeez, it's pourin' out of your nose.              

Listen, my mother's not home.   

We can go to my house           

And get you cleaned up          
there, if you want.           

What about school?          

Well, you've got a good excuse,              

and I really don't care.        

Slow up.                        

<i>I gotta carry all these books.</i>                

<i>All you have to do is bleed.</i>        

<i>Here's your hat.</i>       

Hey, what's that behind your ear?                

<i>I thought you said</i>         
<i>you didn't lose any teeth.</i>     

I didn't.                       

<i>I'm sorry about the shirt, mom.</i>           

<i>Another shirt, we can get.</i>          

 <i>Another tooth, that other</i>      
<i>boy will never grow.</i>     

<i>[ chuckling ]</i>         

<i>If somebody called me a dirty Jew,</i>    

<i>I'd give them a smack.</i>    

<i>And I mean a smack!</i>      

<i>Give him a smack!</i>          

Can I go see Naomi?             

I'm worried about her.          

<i>Naomi, she's in school, no?</i>     

Well, while we were fighting,   
I thought she came back here.   

<i>Oy, gott.</i>              

<i>I was just in the apartment.</i>          

<i>She's not there.</i>       

Go check again.                 

I'll call the school.           

[ siren ]           

We've checked               
every possible lead so far.     

We'll keep on searching         
until it gets dark,           

but then I'm afraid       
the best we can do is to stop,  

and start again in the morning.                 

Officer, you couldn't     
send a few more men?      

A child is missing!         

I have an idea.                 

Remember that time I took     
Naomi to the Holmes airport?    

Yeah. Could be.        

Tell the cop over there.             

[ indistinct ]         

I hope you had             
better luck than we did.        

We saw nothing out there.              

[ indistinct ]         

All right.              

Thank you.              

Goodnight.              

Nothing.            

Nothing.            

Alan, the best thing for you         

is to get some sleep.             

It's almost eleven.         

And your friend Shaunny,        

he should get some sleep, too.        

I'm not going anywhere     
until we find Naomi.      

Me, neither.                    

It could be all night.              

It could be days.       

We have no idea where she is.         

I'm gonna go get a flashlight.               

<i>[ clank ]</i>              

[ groaning ]          

<i>[ squeaky voice ]</i>          

<i>Shaun,</i>            
<i>see what you can do.</i>     

<i>Mrs. Kirschenbaum...</i>     

[ mother: ] Alan, go ahead.                 

Say something.                  

Talk to her.                    

<i>Hey, Naomi.</i>          

<i>I'm okay now.</i>         

<i>It was just</i>          
<i>a little fight we had.</i>    

<i>There's nothing</i>        
<i>to be afraid of.</i>       

<i>Come on, Naomi.</i>        

[ crying ]                      

 [ father: ]             
<i>come here, Naomi.</i>          

<i>Come here, Naomi.</i>          

<i>Come here, sweetheart.</i>    

<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>         

<i>Alan...</i>            

<i>Here, take these flowers.</i>                  

<i>We're friends of Naomi</i>         
<i>and we'd like to say hello.</i>     

Say hi to Naomi.                

<i>Listen for a minute, Alan.</i>             

<i>You're not God.</i>        

<i>You're Alan, and you've</i>    
<i>done all you can.</i>          

<i>But this isn't the end.</i>    

<i>Someday you'll see I'm right.</i>        

<i>Someday this war will be over.</i>         

<i>Someday Hitler will be dead.</i>         

But Naomi will be alive    
<i>and well and happy.</i>      

<i>She needs more time.</i>     

I don't understand.             

<i>Why did this</i>              
<i>have to happen to her?</i>          

<i>What happens in this world</i>         

<i>isn't caused by you or by me...</i>         

<i>and it's not always fair.</i>         

Wait for me.                    

â™ª

â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª         

<i>â™ª I want to be your friend â™ª</i>         

<i>â™ª how can I show you â™ª</i>    

â™ª help you understand? â™ª    

<i>â™ª I'm not here to hurt you â™ª</i>         

<i>â™ª and my love</i>

<i>â™ª take my hand â™ª</i>       

<i>â™ª and on the wings of forever â™ª</i>         

â™ª we can fly away â™ª         

<i>â™ª leave the darkness behind us â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yesterday can't even find us â™ª</i>
