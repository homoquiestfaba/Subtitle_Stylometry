I guess the, uh,
"Honeymoon Suite" wasn't available?

Shut up.

So what now?

I don't know. Me, you...
a nice big bed.

What do you think we're gonna do?

We're gonna sleep.

You trust me not to run away?

No. Actually, I don't.

These are military issue handcuffs.

They can't be picked,
so don't bother trying.

Now, I'm gonna go piss.

Don't go anywhere.

Nice!

What do you think you're doing?

So what's your name?

That was "what's -your-name?"

Trip.

Is that your Christian name?

Who said I was a Christian?

No. I mean, is that your given name,
or is it like a nickname?

It's my name.

I'm just makin' conversation.

What is that, a map of Canada?
The fucking Canada!

An airport.

What kind of bank robber goes
to Canada to catch a plane?

The kind who gets fed up real quick
with mouthy little girls.

What? Two hours ago you said you
weren't even planning on taking a hostage,

and now you've got duck tape?

Plans change.

Please, don't.

My nose is stuffed up.

I won't be able to breathe.

Save your strength.

We've got a long drive ahead
of us tomorrow.

You comfortable?

Don't you fucking touch me!

I have to catch a 6:30 PM flight,
so we'll have to get on the road early.

Good night.

What the...

gimme those!

You didn't!!

So now, you either leave me here,
or you miss your flight.

I can't believe you!!!

I don't wanna go to Canada.

Oh please. Put that away.
Shut up!

I don't think you have the balls to...
Shut up!

You shot me in the fucking shoulder!

Oh, I missed your mouth?

It won't happen again.

You fucking prick!!

Shhhhh! Shut up!

Asshole!!

God damn it, be quiet!

If you wanted me to stay quiet maybe
you shouldna

SHOT ME IN THE SHOULDER!

Shut the fuck up!!

Where are you going?

To see if there's an all-night
hardware store around,

so I can get you outta those.

But I thought you said
they couldn't be picked.

I'll have to figure something out.

I'm not missing my flight.

And I'm not leaving without you.

But, but, but...

you can't just leave me here!

Bleeding!

I'll scream for help,
until somebody comes!

What are you doing?

Something I should have done hours ago.

Hey!

Now be still...

Fuck you!!

You just want me to lay still
so you can poison me?

It's not poison.

Help me! Somebody help me!

Shut up!

God damn it, somebody help me!

Owww!!! Oh my god,
you mean-ass sonofabitch!!

Now just chill out.

I'll be back.

We have to be on the road in three hours.

Great.

Drop the bag.

Now let's see...

the girlie said you kept your gun...

Right here.

You bitch! Why didn't you warn me?

Oh. Look out for the man
behind the... oh damn.

Shut up, both of you.

It's not loaded.

It's not?

Then what made the hole in her?

If it's not loaded, then charge me.

Ah, didn't think it through that far, huh?

Take off your pants.

What kind of a man shoots a girl
when she's already tied up?

Yeah, fucker.

You should at least
give 'em a running start.

I prefer taking em' down with
a blade, myself.

Gimme them pants, quick-draw.

What am I supposed to wear?

Well, I think you look
just precious like that, like you are.

You assholes got anything to eat?

No? Maybe we'll order some grub.

What? Did you shoot the phone, too?

Man, you sure thought of everything.

Well, this sure puts us
in a fuckin' bind doesn't it?

We can't order any food in,
'cause we got no phone.

And I can't leave you here,

'cause you'll just get into
some kind of trouble or some shit.

I guess that means we're all going
for a little trip.

What? What's so funny?

We can't go anywhere,

'cause she swallowed the key
to the handcuffs.

You did what?

That's not why I'm laughing.

Wait a minute,
you swallowed the fuckin' keys?

You said "little trip."

My name is "Trip."

I just imagined
that's what you call your penis.

"Little Trip."

Now maybe I can think.

I'm starving.

Hey, what's in the bag?

Definitely could'a used this last night!

Now, why did you swallow the keys?

'Cause I thought if I couldn't get loose,

he'd have to leave me behind.

So, you don't wanna be here?

Dumb question. Who are you?

My name is Sara.

No, I mean, to him.

What does he want with you?

I don't know.

You don... then why are you here?

This is where he brought me...

Agghhh!! Fuck!

Are, are you trying to be difficult,

or are you just really stupid?

What is she doing here?

She your girlfriend? What?

She's my hostage.

Well, she's not your hostage anymore.

What are you talking about?

You're both mine.

No! You can't, you can't do that!

It, it should... be like a food chain.

I'm your hostage, and she's my hostage!

You can't take my hostage.

What ever happened to
"honour among thieves?"

Well, for one, I ain't no thief.

And two, I can do anything
I want to right now.

What do you need with a hostage, anyway?

What do you need with two of them?

I just escaped from prison.

I need some good regular folks
to help me get around,

and keep any deputies
from chargin' me with guns blazin'

Well, you sure know how to pick 'em!

He robbed a bank.

'Sthat right?

Shut up!

Boy, you need to learn some manners.

I wasn't sayin' it to you,

I was sayin' it to her!

Don't matter. You're rude.

And I don't much care for it.

Anything you do to her, from now on,
I'm gonna do it to you.

So you're a bank robber, huh?

Goddamn the luck.

I finally get out
and I kidnap "Bonnie & Clyde."

This is real fucked up, all right.

She's gonna have to have that shoulder
looked at - it's not that bad,

but if it get's infected...

let's just say you're not gonna
get through a police roadblock

with a girl who's crying,
or bleeding, or puking.

So you fucked up real good there.

Cops are looking for you,
so that doesn't do me any good.

So I gotta take her.
'Cept I ain't goin' near a hospital.

Yeah, we got us a mess here.

Jesse James, you're gonna have to fix her
clean it, dress it.

What?
What makes you think I know how to -

I don't care what you know.

We got a mess here.

You made it. Clean it up.

There, that looks great.

I think you missed your calling.

Man, if I don't get some food in me...

Either one of you remember if
they got vending machines around here?

You know, chips, soda, shit like that.

Think!

I think I saw one when we came in.

By the pool.

Thank you..."Sara" was it?

Uh-huh.

And "Trip"?

Okay, "Trip," back in the toilet.

Guess snacks are on Trip.

You want anything?

I'm kinda thirsty.

Okay. Okay. I'll be back.

That was stupid.

What was?

Telling him where the snack machine was.

Why?

Because if he's worried about being hungry,
he might make a mistake - slip up.

And at least if he'd had to go look
for it himself,

it would have bought us some time.

How does he have the door braced?

What?

How is he locking me in here?
Describe it to me.

Fuck you!

Come on!

No way! You kidnap me, and shoot me,

and call me stupid,
and now you want me to help you?

Not gonna happen.

If we don't work together he's...

Oh, nuh-uh, buddy.

There is no "we." You're on your own.

This guy is a... a...

A what?

I don't know what this guy is.

I just know he's not you!

What, you think you're safer with him
than you woulda been with me?

He didn't shoot me!

It doesn't matter, anyway, does it?

'Cause I'm with him now,
whether I like it or not.

I'm not gonna
bust my ass escaping from him,

just so I can be stuck with you.

I'll make you a deal.

No thanks. Fact of the matter is,
he really only needs one of us.

And he seems to like me.

For now...

what do you think he'll do with
the one of us he doesn't take?

I don't...

I can't stop him from hurting you
if I'm dead.

Here.

You're very trusting.

To just drink whatever I put
in front of you.

I mean,
it's not like you've swallowed anything

I might want you to puke up.

maybe it was just soda.

First thing's first.

I'm gonna enjoy my dinner.

Then, I'm gonna get me outta these.

Then, I'm gonna get you outta those.

You can't. They can't be picked.

They're military issue.

What?

Mil-i-tar-y is-sue.

Let me see that.

Mmmm. You smell good.

bet I can pick 'em.

bet you can't.

I just escaped from prison.

You're trapped in a hotel bathroom.

So, you wanna make a wager?

Maybe.

If you can't spring 'em,
you leave me and the girl here.

It's not like we're gonna call the cops.

What do I get if I win?

It doesn't matter. They can't be picked.

But what if?

Your choice.

You robbed a bank, huh?

Let me think about it.

Like I said... first thing's first.

God almighty, I am free at last.

That's a nice car, Trip.

That's not his car.

It's not?

It's been so long since I smelled a woman.

You don't mind if I just...
smell you for a little bit, do ya?

Okay.

What you doin' in there, boy?

Oh, now you're the strong, silent type, huh?

Maybe he's hurt.

Right. What did you two cook up
while I was gone?

Huh? Guy goes to get a bite to eat...

You come outta there. Now!

Okay, fine.

Maybe I'll just kill the blow-up doll, then.

I'd knock that shit off.

I ain't gonna shoot you in the shoulder.

It's a shame.

I bet you do more then smell good.

How you gonna live with yourself, junior,

knowin' you coulda prevented this
by comin' outta the john?

Well, if this is what you want!

Okay, you win, don't hurt her.

Awww! Loverboy to the rescue.

On the floor.

No. In back.

Up.

What was all that noise in here?

Awww. That's so cuuute. Your first shiv.

Of course,
you'd never get that past one of the guards.

You gotta be a lot more creative
on the inside.

We don't have the luxury of mirrors,
and towels and shit.

You know what makes a good shiv?

A toothbrush.

You can sharpen the handle against
the edge of your bed frame.

Fits in your shoe,
and metal detectors can't find it.

The best one I ever saw, though,
was made of soap.

Swear to god.

Guy sharpened it the same way,
against the frame of his bed.

Never woulda thought the thing would
get so fuckin' sharp...

but sure enough.

Pried this dude's ribs apart, in the shower.

And the beauty part was,
he left it under the running water,

and they never found the weapon.

It just melted away.

Of course,
soap is good for so many things,

besides cleaning, I mean.

After all, if you can bear
to part with one of your socks,

you can make a nice...
"flail" I guess you'd call it.

Packs a mean ol' punch.

Fuck a guy up real good.

And what can they do, right?

They gotta give you socks and soap, right?

That's what I thought
but some of the places now: boy,

they thought of everything.

They make everybody wear flip-flops.

You tried out-running dogs in pursuit
in a pair of flip-flops?

Ya can't do it.

And some of these places,
they make guys wash with the liquid soap.

That just doesn't seem right to me.

I don't feel clean.

Lucky me, my prison still had socks,
and good ol' bar soap.

I've spent every day for the last ten years

figurin' out new and better ways
to hurt people.

Don't fuck with me.

Now, where were we?

Were you really going to kill me?

He came out, I didn't have to.

But, what if he hadn't?

But he did.

What is it about me
you like smelling so much?

Is it my hair? Or my skin? Or my perfume?

The blood.

Yeah.

So... you were away for...

Ten years.

Are you married?

What kind of question is that?

Well, if you were,
at least you could have conjugal visits.

What do you know about conjugal visits?

I know enough.

I know ten years is a long time
to go without... the company of a woman.

Oh, oh oh oh oh ohohoh.

You're an expert on a lot of things.

I'm just saying...

Oh, I hear ya.

Are you "offering" yourself to me?

Maybe...

Why?

Did my... roughin' up the "Tripster"
get you all hot?

Maybe I just want him to hear us.

I see... punish him, so he doesn't
think you owe him or nothing?

Is that it?

Bet you couldn't get a piece of ass
like this in prison.

You take a whole lot for granted, huh?

What do you mean?

Well, you're quick on your feet.

But you say things
without thinkin' em through.

What?

You think, by letting me fuck you,

you're gonna..."win my favor",
so nothing bad will happen to you.

Not necessarily.

You're handcuffed to the bed.

If I wanted to fuck you,
I would with or without your blessing.

You also take for granted that
I would want a "piece of ass" like you.

Maybe I like humping men.

Maybe I got all the ass I needed
when I was locked up.

You also make the illogical
jump that says,

if I like fucking you I won't kill you.

You don't know that.

Maybe what I like is fucking a girl,
and cutting her head off.

Or cutting her head off,
and then fucking her.

You don't know anything about me.

You don't seem like the type.

Well, you don't seem like the type who
would offer herself to a psychopath,

but you just did it.

What you do seem like is a liar.

Why do you say that?

Who is Aria Giovanni?

What?

Aria Giovanni. Who is she?

I don't know.

You don't?

That's funny, because that's who your car
is registered to.

Now, either your name isn't Sara,
or that's not really your car.

And from the look on your face,
I'd say that's not your car.

Kidnapping 101:
never take a hostage in a stolen car.

Apparently,
something "dipshit" in there overlooked.

We're not going to get very far
in that car.

It... it's my sister's.

Bullshit. You just said you didn't know
who she was.

I - I just didn't want her
to get dragged into this.

Dragged into what?

See, either you're lying now,

or you were lying then, or both, or...

I don't know.

You're a liar, so you might as well not
even open your mouth anymore.

Let me expl...

Shut it.

You still got any o' them snacks?

What!?

I'm, I'm starving in here.

Can I get a bag of chips or something?

If I pass out,
you'll have to lug my body around.

Yeah, and if I kill you,
I got the same problem,

except that you'll stay quiet.

What are you doin' stealin' a car?

Nah, fuck it. You'll probably just lie anyway.

I'm going to go move that car
a few blocks from here.

You two behave.

A car ride to Canada is starting
not to sound so bad, huh?

Fuck off.

We can get out of this.
You do want out of this, don't you?

Shut up.

You're not on his "favorite people"
list anymore.

I'd still rather be me than you.

Right, but if we're us, we can beat him.

He's just one guy.

Yeah, one guy who's got me chained
to a bed...

and you're doing a real bang-up job
from in there.

We've got the upper hand here.
He's got the police looking for him.

He's got to get moving.
He can't sit still.

So do we. You robbed a bank, remember?

You just said "we."

I meant you.

The point is, when he realizes
he can't take us with him

because of those handcuffs
he'll have to leave us.

Or leave me here. And take you.

He won't do that.

So what's your plan?

I'm just gonna talk to him.

Genius.

Hey, uh... thanks. For earlier.

For what?

For coming out.

When he was gonna shoot me.

You didn't have to do that, so thanks.

Yes I did... I kidnapped you first.

They sure get the paper out early here,
don't they?

Hey, guy?

You didn't pass out yet?

You ready to try the handcuffs?

What?

Our bet.

You said you thought you could pick 'em,

and I say you can't.

I don't need to.
I can cut her loose with this shit.

Where's the sport in that?

This ain't about sport, fella.

I don't have time for sports.

I gotta be movin' on outta here,
right quick.

Well,
I guess you better get movin' then, huh?

So grab your gunshot car thief,
and hop in your stolen automobile,

and live happily ever after.

Or would you rather grab the wanted
bank robber and hit the road?

Either way, you won't get very far.

You'd be better off starting from scratch.

What bank did you rob?

What?

What bank did you rob?

I wanna see if you're in the paper.

Why? They got something?

Maybe. Which bank was it?

Oh, so you're a modest bank robber?

How refreshing.

What are you doing?

Trying to figure out...

Just exactly where...

I'd have to punch you...

Get you to spit up those keys.

I know you're a filthy liar.

You can't help it: you're a woman.

I don't want to fuck you.

And, while,
I would like to kill you very much,

I won't. If you can help me.

Help you how?

Tell me what you know. About Trip.

Just met him yesterday.

Just tell me what you've noticed
in that one day, then.

How was he in the bank? How did he work?

I don't know.

Too... what?

Too scared? Too much going on?

Didn't have a good look at him?

No. I wasn't there.

You weren't?

No, he kidnapped me later.

What, like car-jacked you?

Pretty much.

Where was this at?

Just a couple of miles from here.

What did he say?

When?

When he got in your car.

He told me not to move,
and not to scream.

Or what?

He didn't say.

Did he drive, or did you?

He did.

Did he tell you he robbed a bank?

Yes.

How was he? Was he calm?

Did he seem agitated?

He was pretty cool.

Were you scared?

Not at first.

Did he have the money with him?

He wasn't carrying anything,
except the gun.

Oh...

This gun?

They say, when you've got a gun,

and you really intend to use it,

it's not like carrying anything at all.

It becomes an extension of your body.

Like your arm. Or your cock.

You tell me: does this feel like
I'm rubbing a gun on your face?

Or does it feel like...
a part of my body?

I know how it feels, to me.

Kiss it. Go on.

Nooo, you can do better than that.

Take it in your mouth.

Let's just hope it doesn't feel too good,

'cause if this shoots in your mouth,
you have no choice but to swallow.

I see he's got an atlas out over there
did he say where he was going?

Oh yeah, where?

CANADA.

What's that? "Canada?"

What the fuck is in Canada?

You know what the difference is?

With a cock in her mouth,
a girl can't help but lie to you.

But, put a gun in her mouth,

and you can be sure even the worst lying
bitch will tell you the truth,

swear to fuckin' god.

What's he gonna do in Canada?

He's catching a plane.

Oh, so he's got his whole escape planned,
huh?

I guess.

Did he say
where he had hidden the money?

Not to me.

Okay, Sara, you find out
where he's got that money hidden,

and where he's flyin' off to,
I won't kill you.

You think you can do that?

What if he won't tell me?

Then what good are you to me?

Damn, that was hot!

I need a shower.

Well, I needed one anyway, but...

I'm gonna bring him out here,
and you go to work.

How am I supposed to ask him things
if you cover my mouth?

We don't want to seem obvious, do we?

Now don't get any crazy ideas,

'cause I'm just gonna be
in the next room.

And I ain't gonna be gone that long.

All right, potty-man,
I need you to clear out.

My days of showering in front of
other men are long gone.

I'm gonna chain you up there
with the girlfriend,

as soon as I can find...

Where's the gun?

You lost, so just...

Tell me where the gun is.

Motherfucker! Where's the gun!?

Sara, what did he do with the gun?

We're gonna do it like this?

I got all night to kick your ass.

Where's the gun!?

I hate... HATE... repeating myself.

Wherever it is, I'm going to get to
it before you, got it?

And what would you do if you had it?

You couldn't even aim it at me,
what with your little jewelry on there.

And I don't need a gun to end you,
anyway.

So what are we doing?

This is not productive.

For the last time:
where the hell is the...

I'd like to give you an "A" for effort.

But instead...

I'm gonna let you two fight it out
for a bit while I take a shower.

Now, you two play nice.

Under the bed. Jesus Christ.

God damn it!

Oh, here. Let me help you.

Can you move your head to my hands?

USE YOUR TEETH.

What?

YOUR TEETH.

My what?

TEETH!

My feet?

Oh, my teeth!

What was that for?

Are you complaining?

No, I just...

Don't leave me.

I won't.

I'm so scared.

What did he do? Are you okay?

Trip, I'm just so scared.

It's okay. It's okay.

We'll get out of this.

Please - I'll come with you,
whatever you want.

I just don't want to die.

I won't let you.

What were you planning to do with me?

Before he showed up...

why did you kidnap me?

Panic, I guess.

If the cops got close to me,
I'd have... some leverage.

Would you have killed me?

No. Never. I might threaten to -
make them think I was gonna.

But I would never do that.

I wouldn't hurt you.

Other than shooting me, you mean.

Yeah, that. That was... that was dumb.

I'm sorry.

Where you flying to? From Canada?

Someplace warm.

Sounds nice. How far you takin' me?

After all this,
you're not gonna wanna see me ever again.

If you get me outta this,
I promise I'll go anywhere with you.

I don't got shit here, anyway.

Not even a car.

I think he's gonna kill me.

Not if I have anything to say about it.

Who said you will?

If he was gonna kill you,
I think he'd have done it already.

He's just a mean prick
who likes scaring us.

I think I know
why he hasn't killed me yet.

He wants your money.

My money?

The money you stole.

When you robbed the bank.

I think he thinks I can get it from you.

Well, he's barking up the wrong tree.

Maybe.

But if I don't figure out something
to tell him,

so he thinks I'm...

so he thinks I'm working on you,
then I'm screwed.

Well, Sara, I got nothing to tell you.

No. I know.

You wouldn't, I mean, why would you?

I wouldn't expect...

that's not what I was...

It's not that.

This isn't the movies.

The bad guy doesn't really
spell out his whole -

not that you're the bad guy -

I could tell him not to hurt you.

That I won't cooperate unless
he promises...

You can't do that. You can't tell him that.

He can't know that. Please.

So what do you wanna do?

I don't know. I just wish...

What?

I, well...
we could put our heads together except...

there's nothing in mine. So to speak.

I'm at a disadvantage.

Okay, okay. I - who cares if I did or not...

If there was something to tell...

What do you mean?

I'm gonna level with you because
I can't help you the way you want:

there is no money. I don't have it.

I have no access to it. It's not mine.

I can't tell anyone where to go get it,
because I don't know where it is.

Really?

So, I don't have anything to tell you.

Or him. Or anybody.

So, what am I supposed to do now?

I'm dead.

Lie to him.

But I'm not a good liar.

Sure you are. We all are.

It's evolution.

Stall.

Drag it out as long as you can,
until we get an opportunit...

Shut up. Look.

Where? What?

Up there. His knife. In the wall.

So?

We're down here.

I think I can reach it. With my feet.

There.

What are you gonna do with that?

Go to work on the handcuffs.

But they can't be picked.

Mine. But not yours.

But with that?

What would you suggest I use?

Now hold still.

No, no. Give it to me.

No way.

What do you know about picking locks?

Ow, shit!

Fuck!

AAAAAAGGGGHHHHHH!!

Fuck!

You can pull your hand out now!

What did you do?

YOU CUT OFF MY THUMB!!!

You're out, aren't you!?

Oh, fuck! I need the ice bucket!

Ice bucket!!

Fucking ice...

this fucking place doesn't have
A FUCKING ICE BUCKET!!!

Where's my thumb!?

Where's my thumb!? Where's my thumb!?

No...

Gimme my thumb.

THAT'S FOR SHOOTING ME,
YOU FUCKING PRICK!!

And bringing me here
with a fucking psycho

who wants to kill me because
you don't have any money!!

You fucking twisted fucking cunt!

I thought I told you assholes to behave!

what're you doin'
makin' a mess, and noise!? Jesus!

She cut off my fucking thumb.

I don't want you bleedin' all over me
after my bath.

Where's the thumb?

SHE ATE IT!!!

Looks good.

You got one hell of an oral fixation, huh?

Tell me: did you like it?

Cutting into his flesh?

Severing a part of him.

Destroying some of god's handiwork -
even if he's not the best example of it.

Gotta admit, it never occurred
to me to eat off o' someone,

though. Man, that's wild.

I think it started for me
when I was a little kid.

I'd take a razor,
or scissors, or whatever...

and cut into myself, just a little bit.

Cut into my arm until it stung.

I didn't like the hurt.

It was the cutting I liked.

It's like jerkin' off in a way.

Sure it feels good,
but I'm doin' all the work, ya know?

Don't with someone else -
that's the way to go.

And you, the little cannibal.

You're into a whole different thing.

Come here.

I been chokin' on my own blood
my whole life -

to the point
where I can't stand the taste.

But I wonder how it tastes
to someone else.

Someone as sick as me.

Oh, I see.

You want Trip inside you, but not me.

I guess it's time for you to go.

DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I FOUND OUT!?

Oh, yeah. That. Whatchu got?

There is no money.

He doesn't have it.

He doesn't... even know where it is.

Thank you. That was very informative.

NO, WAIT!

Now what?

Don't you think that's weird?

Everything about him...
and you... is weird.

But aren't you curious
about where the money went?

Not really. Why, do you know?

No.

Well, then.

I suppose if I get curious,
I can ask him myself.

God, no! Please!

You tell me to ask him,
and then you don't care!

I don't understand! What do you want!?

What was that? What was that?

A woman, who is actually concerned
about what I want?

I may have to let you live yet.

I'd be, killing off a rare,
endangered species.

At least you woulda died like a man, right?

I mean, you didn't resort to blubbering
and begging.

So, what do you make of all this?

I don't know.

You think it's weird that he robbed a bank,
and has no money to show for it, huh?

Yeah.

Why do ya think that is?

You never saw him in a bank.

He has no money.

There's nothing about a bank robbery
in the paper...

You don't think he robbed a bank.

You just put that together, just now?

Well, at least you're finally
usin' your head.

Yeah, I figure ol' Trip ain't smart
enough to pull a bank job.

So then why did you want me
to talk to him?

See, he's obviously up to something.

That's why he grabbed you,
brought ya here,

Question is why?

I don't know.

Of course you don't.

It could be anything.

I mean,
I can list hundreds of reasons why

I personally have grabbed
some random girl off the street...

But, what if he didn't just grab
some "random" girl?

Maybe the reason he's here,
doin' all this shit,

has something to do... with... you.

What are you talking about?

You tell me.

Why would someone wanna kidnap you?

I have no idea.

Really? No idea? No idea at all?

You wanna tell me about that stolen car?

I mean, "your sister's car."

See, I hit on something, here.

If he wanted the car back,
why didn't he just take it?

This ain't about the car and you know it.

Why are you doing this?

Because it's fun.

So why did he pretend
to be a bank robber?

Why does anyone lie?

But let's not worry about him
for a second.

I'm a lot more interested
in you right now.

You not gonna talk?

then I'm done with you.

You can't keep doing that!!

Oh, no? Why'd you steal a car?

'Cause I wanted one!

Why not buy one, like other folks?

I don't have a lot of money.

No. That ain't it.

It's not about money, or getting around.

It's about the act.

Of knowing you're better than them

because you can do it
and get away with it.

I respect that. I respect the hell out of that.

Unless you're just lyin' to me again.

How could I lie?

You're doing all the talking.

Good point.

Here, we got Trip, who wants everyone
to think he's the real thing,

but he's just a faker.

And you, who is the real fuckin' McCoy
if I ever met it,

and you want everyone
to think you're not.

The two extremes.

And in the middle is me:

perfectly comfortable with who I am
and what I am.

It's like fate brought us together,
for me to teach the two of you...

So what's Trip's deal?

Well, why don't we bring him out
and ask him?

Why? You shouldn't have to.

I mean, you've gotten this far
on just your intuition.

Why not finish it off?

Way I figure it, Trip was hired
by somebody to bring you back.

You ever get picked up
for boostin' cars?

No shame in it.

Happens to the best of us.

So I figure,
what? You skip out on your bond.

Am I close?

And Trip was sent to bring you back.

Let's bring him out,
and see what I win for being right.

You're not a complete retard,

so I'm gonna assume
you were listening through the door.

I was.

Okay. Lay it on us.

Can you undo me?

I'm losing circulation to my foot.

You have a gun, what am I gonna do?

Oh, fuck you. You're no fun anymore.

Alright. So tell me: How close am I?

You're pretty good.

Yeah? Right on the money?

You're close.

What'd I miss?

Well, you had me figured.

Good work there.

Sara, though...

let's just say she's not as much
like you as you think.

I don't know, dude.

She sure had her way with you.

She skipped out on her bond, yes.

Do you wanna know the charges?

Petty larceny. Prostitution.

And conspiracy to commit murder.

Murder? No shit!

It's not as sexy as all that.

She contracted a guy over the internet
to kill her daddy.

Her rich daddy.

That's why she did all of it.

She's just some rich bitch trying to
get back at her daddy.

He's the one who hired me
to bring her back.

Rich girl rebellion?

Where's the integrity in that?

I thought you were the real thing, sweetie.

Poor little rich girl.

Poor little rich girl with two thumbs!

I guess I was wrong.

I thought you had it,
that killer instinct.

I was hopin' maybe you
and me could start a new breed.

But you're just like everybody else.

Worse, you're a faker.

I never told you I was all those things.

You're right, you didn't.

But you let me believe it,
and that's just as bad.

What's she worth?

Doesn't matter.

Don't fuck with me, boy.

I won't stop at your thumb.

It was an exclusive contract.
They hired me.

Even if you show up,
they won't pay you.

Quit puttin' words in my mouth.
I jut asked what she was worth. A lot.

Why did you pretend to be a bank robber?

Shut up.

No, answer her. I'd like to hear this.

I thought that...

If you knew I was here to bring you back,
you'd try to escape.

And you probably would.

This way, since you had nowhere to go,

I thought,
you might just come along for the ride.

It started to work, too.

It did not!

Oh, that kiss.
That was all a lie, too, I suppose?

I can't take it.

I'm gonna cut the girl loose, and...

You forgot about our bet.

Oh, yeah.

If you can't pick the lock,

you leave the girl here with me.

How many tries do I get?

Dose matter!

You can have as many as you want.

That doesn't seem very practical,
for time's sake.

Okay, one try.

Fuck that!
What?

That's not fair.

That's not nearly enough tries.

Whooo! I think she's pickin' sides.

Okay, three then.

Is that better?

Three tries.

There, got it!

No wait, false alarm.

That was one.

Fuck!

I can't do it! Fuck!

You win, Trip. I can't do it.

No. You've got one more chance!

How many times you gotta beat your head
into a wall

'fore you realize it don't feel good?
I can't do it!

You get three tries. That was only two!

Oh, god damn it, for Pete's sake!

There, three.

'Course, it doesn't seem like
Sara wants to go with you, Trip.

I don't know why, myself.

She's got a better chance with you,
it seems.

I won, state fair and town square.

Yes, technically, you did.

But let's look at this for a moment.

What's to look at?

Why don't you shut up
and let the man talk.

Thank you. Now, your way, Trip:

I walk out that door,
leave you two here.

You take her back,
or try to, but she escapes.

Then you got nothing, for all your trouble,

'cept a missing thumb. And, me,
I got nobody to talk to.

I gotta grab somebody else,
and, well, frankly,

I don't know if I'm gonna like somebody
else as much as Sara.

Nobody wins, except, Sara, I guess.

But does she really? She's got no car.

And no money, and a hole in her arm.

What are you thinking?

Why don't you tell me.

I don't know.

Don't try to read my mind.

Just use yours, and see if you can find
a way everyone can win.

This is bullshit.

I won! A deal is a deal!

Be quiet. Let the girl think.

If I go with him,
he's just gonna try and turn me in.

Yep.

Which is bad, unless I can escape.

Which you can.

Except, when I escape,

I know it's only a matter of time
before he comes after me again.

Him, or someone like him.

I think I just said all that,
but keep going.

If I go with you...
there are no guarantees.

Right. I'll probably just kill you,

or sell you to some pimp in Tijuana.

This really sucks!

We'll get to you in a minute.

I don't... I don't see how I can win.

Hmm. Guess you're right.

Come with me and don't escape.

What was that?

Why not come with me willingly.

So you can turn me in!?

I got an idea:

hows about he lets me outta these handcuffs
and I kick your ass!

Stumpy motherfucker!

You come with me, voluntarily:

I won't pull anything,
you don't pull anything.

I turn you in...

No way!

Listen!

I turn you in, collect the money,
and split it with you: fifty-fifty.

Then, if you wanna run away again,
you have some money to run on.

What's the catch?

No catch. I get to turn you in,
and collect half the money.

I don't care what happens after that.

Okay.

Well, that's great for you two.

But what about me?

What about you??

hit the road.

I already beat you.

Yeah, I'll beat you alright.

Let's see you collect your money
with two bloody stumps, and no head.

He's right.

He could kill both of us if he wanted.

But he doesn't get shit if he does that.

He needs us.

We could give a fuck about him,
but he needs us.

You know, I'm right here.

You don't have to talk about me like
I'm the fucking Pope.

What about a three-way?

You never, never cease to amaze me.

She's talking about a three way
cut of the money.

Yeah. That way everyone wins.

Just exactly how much are we talking about?

Yeah, how much am I worth?

A lot.

You better say a number, boy,
or the deal's off,

and the maid in this joint is gonna wish
she'd stayed in bed tomorrow.

I haven't agreed to this yet, anyway.

So it... You're just the middle man.

I don't feel like sharin' even stevens...

This is my deal!

You're not even a part of this!

How much is your life worth to you, Trip?

Is it worth your half of the pot?

If you kill him then nobody
get's anything!

Right. You're right.

I pull this trigger,
and I don't see any of that money.

But so what?

I'm no worse off than I was
before I walked through that door.

Trip, on the other hand...

Fuck! You are right! You win!!

Sara - you got any problem with that?

I wanna know how much.

Fair enough.

I mean, it wouldn't be the first time

he completely shit-face lied about
having money.

I never said I had any money.

But you let me believe it,
and that's just as bad.

You're both a coupla liars.

I think we established that.

But the girl's got a point:
how much are we talkin'

Five hundred thousand dollars.

Holy Shit.

I can see why you were
so reluctant to let it go.

Five hundred thousand...

Yep.
From the man you tried to have killed.

He just bought you a new life.

How do I know one of you guys isn't
gonna try and screw me out of my cut.

How do I know you're not gonna split
before we collect?

It's, uh... how did Trip put it earlier?

"Honour among thieves?"

As hard as it may be,
we're gonna have to trust each other.

I still don't see what
I get out of all this.

You get to live, you crybaby-bitch.

Now suck it up!
Everyone in agreement, then?

Let's shake on it.

You think it's funny, to belittle me!?

That you can just say
whatever the fuck you want,

and I JUST HAVE TO TAKE IT!?

Put down the gun!

No. I'm not gonna to put down the gun.

Fuck you, put it down!

No, goddamn it, no!

These aren't the actions of
a"team player," Trip.

I'll fuckin' give you gills, man!

Trip, let him go!

Boy, you're deep into character,
huh, buddy?

You're gonna do what I tell you!

I'm gonna count to three,

and then I'm going to put a hole
in the girl,

and then you've got nothing.

No, please!! Trip!!

You kill her, I kill you!

I could shoot the both o' ya before you
could even find the pointy end of that thing.

I am sick and tired of you
talking down to me!

You fucking show me respect!!

One...

Show me respect!!!

Damn it, Trip!

Two...

God damn it!

No! Don't!

Three!

Look at that.

Seems Trip doesn't know how to work
and play well with others.

Stay put.

Oooh, that's ugly, ain't it?

I didn't want it to end like this.

Nothing worse than stabbing somebody
by accident.

It's like cumming in your pants.

Unless you don't believe in accidents.

Do you, Sara? Or do you believe in fate?

Was this destined to be?

I don't have those answers,
but I do know this.

Never take the word of a liar...

They coulda been picked any time.

Ain't that a pisser?

You want some, too?

Did that make you feel like a man?

Getting' all up in my shit.

Raisin' your voice, threatening me.

You feel tough, huh?

For the first time in your life,

you felt like your cock was
for more than peein' I bet, huh?

You think you coulda done it? Cut me?

I got news for you: You're still a bitch.

Open up.

Believe me, I didn't want it
to go down like this, man.

I coulda used the money.

But I'm not gonna sit here and
start cryin' over some dead slut.

The way I look at it,
I just saved the poor asshole

who woulda wound up marryin' that girl

a lifetime of lies and agony,
and a broken heart.

And that... that is worth any bounty.

Ah, ah! Don't make me blow the back of
your neck off.

Or were you just gonna tell me
it's not loaded again?

Awww. Poor bastard.

You really fell for her, didn't you?

What were you sayin' about a kiss?

Oh, that's nice. That's so nice.

She tried to fuck me, but she kissed you.

That's nice.

It's not too late, ya know.

We could still prop up her body
and have a little fun with her.

YOU'RE SICK.

You figure that out all just now?

I didn't hear anything, Trip.

You calling me sick?

No time to get shy now.

Not when I got another couple of
inches of this thing

I can stuff down your throat.

Does that mean you want him
to suck your cock, too?

What?

Stay where you are.

Why? I just saved your life!

You saved shit.

Wha... he tried to kill me,
and he was gonna kill you!

There's only one murderer
in this room: You!

Oh, my god! Are you insane!?

Maybe. Maybe that's what happens

when you CUT SOMEBODY'S THUMB OFF...
and STAB HIS BROTHER TO DEATH!

Your brother?

AaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH!!!
You asshole!!

Geddaway from me!!

Let me look...

Fucking do not touch meee!

Yousonuvabitch!! Don't touch meee!

Me?

We had it planned...

Don't you ever die?

So this was all... a game?

No game.

I don't play around with $500,000.

I don't under... understand!

Good cop, bad cop...

What!?

We bring you here, confuse you,
spook you a little.

You pick the lesser of two evils,

that guy turns you in,
and we split the paycheck.

You guys are fucking psycho!

Now, you wanna start
with the name-calling, too?

For god's sake, call an ambulance!

If I get her to a hospital,
I can still collect...

Not for her. For me!

I hate to break this to you,
but you're pretty fucked up.

I don't think there'll be much
they can do for you.

Her, on the other hand...

Fuck that bitch!

Hold on a sec.

Why? Why go through all this?

I don't understand.

There's lots of shit I don't understand.

That doesn't stop it from happening.

Kill her!

Are you out of your mind!?

This isn't a girl anymore!

This is a bloody heap of money!

That bitch killed me!!

Yeah, and I shot her for it.

I must've been out of my mind,
shooting her.

It's an incredible stroke of good luck
that she's not dead.

She can be patched up.

I'm your fucking brother! Kill her!!!

You shut up! You shut up!

You don't get to boss me anymore!

Do you have any dying wishes for how
I should spend your half of the money?

We had it all planned.

Don't let me die... Please!?

Sh-sh-sh. There, now. Just hush up.

God damn it, don't let me die.

CALL AN AMBULANCE!

I'm not calling a fucking ambulance.

Not here. And explain all of this.

I'm not going to jail.

Somebody had to have heard the gunshots,
and the screaming.

Help is probably already on its way.

No. No it's not.

We bought up this entire row of rooms
for the night.

And last night, and tomorrow.

I slept in that one last night.

And Dennis was waiting in that one
all day until we got here.

Man, you guys thought of everything.

So none of it was real?

Except the money.

And your thumb, you cripple.

Pleeeeeeeaaasssee... man...

And the number I did on your brother.

I will be dieing!

Shut up! Who's the fucking crybaby now!?

Sara, you don't wanna die, do you?

Okay. Here goes: One...

...l'm going to take you to a hospital.

You're going to say we were attacked
in an alley,

and you're going to stick to that story.

Two, I'm going to call your father
and have him meet us.

Three, he's going to arrive, and pay me,
and that's it.

By the time the hospital alerts the
authorities to your identity, I'm gone.

I don't give a fuck
what happens after that.

I just want my money.

Oh, god!!!

Or I can leave you here to die.

Your choice. You got some holes in ya.

It doesn't look good.

See that. Sara.

Is that what you want?

If you wanna kill someone, here's a hint:

you gotta shoot 'em somewhere a little
more vital than the arm, okay?

That's twice.

What about your gut?

You're hit pretty bad.

You hit a scar, princess.

I got tons of 'em.

I won't even notice one more.

Now when I did your brother over there,

I was sure to aim for his lungs,
his kidneys.

His large intestine, boy that's a bleeder.

What are you?

A survivor.

You had no idea
what you got yourself into.

You didn't stand a chance.

Open your eyes.

It's okay to be fascinated by me.

They always are. Look at me. Come on.

OPEN YOUR EYES!

Take a good look.

One long,
last good look.

And you know...

For about a second,
I actually did like you...
