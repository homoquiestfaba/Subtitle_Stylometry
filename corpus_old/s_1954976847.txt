        "Robot Chicken."        

   For 100 episodes, they've    
  defiled every entertainment   

          brand in the          
        known Universe.         

           [ ting! ]            

Now their greatest challenge -- 

riding the coattails of the most
 iconic characters of all time, 

          not counting          
         Harry Potter.          

   The DC Comics superheroes!   

       Some of them more        
       super than others.       

         That guy just          
         talks to fish.         

              Hey!

            Oh, boy!            
       The invisible jet!       

          - Hurry up!           
       - Let's go, buddy!       

            Come on!            

          I'm coming!

      You're gonna be the       
     last one to the party.     

     'Cause you can't fly.      

             Fine.              
     I'll just swim there.

          Silly punks.

     Now taste fear, you --     

       Wait. Wait. What?        
            Oh, god!            

Oh, my back just snapped like a 
  pack of uncooked spaghetti!   

 Oh, you just walk up and break 
 my back without saying a word!

        Boo on you, sir!

         Hi! I'm B'DG.          

      I'm a member of the       
      Green Lantern Corps.      

           ANNOUNCER:           
   Can you believe it, folks?   

       He really exists.        

             Uh...              

     Do you guys want me to     
      say anything, or...?      

           ANNOUNCER:           
       Tune in next time        
     for another edition of     

     "Real Characters From      
       The DC Universe."        

   Lois, you helped me defeat   
         General Zod --         

         "Superman II."         

        But now you know        
         I'm Superman.          

      I-I have to kiss you      
      and make you forget.      

     Why would that be one      
      of your superpowers?      

         [ mockingly ]          
       "Why would that be       
       blah blah blah? "        

    You should hear yourself    
        sometimes, Lois.        

          [ smooches ]          

           Huh? What?           

  Why am I standing here with   
  Clark Kent when I should be   

       chasing the scoop        
          on Superman?          

      I should really use       
     that power more often.     

       My beautiful hair.       

   I'll never forget how you    
  took it from me, Superman --  

   <i>Adventure Comics</i> number 271. 

          Oh, really?           

           Superman!            
        I'll destroy --         

     Wh-what are you doing?     

          [ smooches ]          

       I-I can't remember       
        why I hate you.         

       Oh, yeah. I know.        

      â™ª You might want to       
       close your eyes â™ª        

     â™ª I'll run my fingers      
      through your hair â™ª       

   â™ª And I'll kiss you, bro     

        â™ª And you won't         
       remember a thing â™ª       

   â™ª Don't try and run away     

       â™ª I'm faster than        
      a speeding bullet â™ª       

     Another job well done.     

   â™ª And I'll catch you --      

      [ record scratches ]      

       Ew. I should have        
     thought this through.      

              Huh?              

              Huh?              

           Oh, well.

      Hey, how's it going?      

          [ mutters ]           

          Oh, come on!          

Welcome, everyone, to the grand 
 opening of our newest exhibit, 

    The Blue Star of Egypt.     

        [ crowd gasps ]         

           [ sighs ]            
       All right, people.       

       We all know what's       
          coming next.          

  Let's see if we can at least  
   make it through a round of   

   hors d'oeuvres before the    
  first supervillain shows up.  

          Apparently,           
 there's a salmon bagel bite -- 

       Everybody, freeze!       

    [ dramatic music plays ]    
      [ crowd screaming ]       

Sorry to be so coldhearted, but 
Mr. Freeze is stealing that ice.

    [ screaming continues ]     

          [ crunches ]          
              Mmm!              

  I was not expecting paprika.  

 Mmm! A-plus effort, honestly.  

      Everyone, chill out!      
    [ dramatic music plays ]    

      Or Captain Cold will      
        put you on ice!         

          Oh, come on!          

       I thought we had a       
      schedule worked out!      

        This is <i>my</i> day!         

    I have a new assistant.     

  I-I'm still breaking him in.  

      Everyone, stay cool!      
    [ dramatic music plays ]    

  It's about to get downright   
     bone-chilling in here,     

      thanks to ...Icicle!      

    Wow. I just walked into     
     a cluster [bleep] huh?     

              Mmm!              

   You guys, you have to try    
     these salmon thingies.     

      Focus, Captain Cold.      

 Clearly, there's not room for  
   three cold-themed villains   

       with freeze rays.        

   I guess you two snow jobs    

      will have to change       
        gimmicks, then.         

      It's not my gimmick!      

     I'll literally die in      
       warm temperatures.       

My cryogenically frozen wife is 
  my entire reason for living.  

    My name is Victor Fries,    
        for God's sake.         

  It's "Freeze," but you spell  
 it "Fries," like french fries. 

             Weird.             

          It's German.          

    Well, I ain't changing,     
           ya dicks.            

       Everyone, freeze!        

     Oh, for [bleep] sake!      

    Ohh! I completely forgot    
       about Chillblaine.       

        You    <i>a</i>America,        
             buddy.             

    It took me six years of     
research to build my freeze ray.

     How do you high-school     
   dropouts keep making them?   

      Are they as easy to       
      build as ham radios       

          and I'm just          
          an asshole?!          

Uh, guys, we've demolished a lot
 of load-bearing walls in here. 

      Well, those villains      
    are going to the cooler,    

     thanks to Ice and her      
     amazing freeze powers.     

     [ siren chirps, dies ]     

             Cool!              

  I'm glad you guys could come  
    all the way to Earth-C.     

     Me and Captain Carrot      
           didn't see           

        eye to eye on a         
         lot of things,         

      but no one deserved       
       to die like that.        

    I never met the Captain     
        or his zoo crew,        

         but since you          
        vouched for him,        

      I'm glad to be here       
     in their time of need.     

   [ car door opens, closes ]   

          [ giggling ]          

     Why didn't you tell me     
    they look like cartoons?    

             Wait.              

       [ clears throat ]        

           I'm good.            

           [ laughs ]           

      Damn it! I'm sorry.       

 If you can't keep it together, 
       you need to leave.       

        I know. I know.         
       For the love of --       

 It's a turtle wearing goggles! 

           I'm sorry.           
           I'm sorry.           

         [ taps plays ]         

     [ stifling laughter ]      

           [ grunts ]           

            I'm s--             

           I'm sor--            
      it's just ...that...      

        he looks so sad.        

           [ snorts ]           

          [ laughing ]          
           I can't --           

           I can't --           
           I'm sorry.           

            I can't!            

      Your friend was very      
         inappropriate.         

        We're so sorry,         
         little cheese.         

           [ laughs ]           
        "Little Cheese."        

    I just don't see how you    
   could let it get this bad.   

   It's a swamp thing, baby.    

    You wouldn't understand.    

              Ahh.              

      Bane broke my back,       
     but years of training      

       allowed me to heal       
        in record time.         

         Now let's see          
       what the Joker --        

        Oh, my God, no!

              Aah!              

        Like a string of        
         firecrackers!          

        My [bleep] back!        

  I felt the soles of my feet   
   touch the back of my head    

          on that one!          

         â™ª Do do do-do,         
         that's Bane â™ª

      Is he the kid in the      
    mailroom with the B.O.?     

      Every day, I'm like,      
   "I smell the mail coming,"   

       and sure enough --       
      - I'm Leonard Snart.      

              Ah!               
      How could I forget?       

       I think that kid's       
         name is Glenn.         

    Oh, somebody's going to     
      get a big surprise!       

           [ laughs ]           

  Oh, and new rule this year,   
          everybody --          

       no exploding toys.       

  Hey! I'm literally the only   
   one affected by that rule!   

   I still have a scar in my    
 forehead from Christmas 2004,  

       you dumb butthole.       

            It's --             
    it's how I express love.    

   Has everyone drawn a name?   

           [ sniffs ]           

          Oh. Oh, god!          

     Wh-what smells like a      
      turd-lover's pizza?       

           Hey, guys.           

     We doing Secret Santa      
        again this year?        

      [ villains mumble ]       

   Oh! Noncommittal mumbling.   

      Yeah, it's the gift       
     that keeps on giving.      

           [ coughs ]           

 I have a glandular condition,  
           you guys!            

      It is not my fault!       

    You think I don't try?!

 his battle against body odor,

     Ladies and gentlemen,      
   I don't know how to break    

      this news in any way      
    that makes sense of it,     

     so I'll just give you      
   the facts as I have them.    

      Glenn killed himself      
  during the commercial break.  

            My god!             

        What was that?!         

I don't know, but I'll find out,
          Mr. Jordan.

             Whoa!              
        This is so cool!        

           Not quite            
    "Independence Day" cool,    

      but much cooler than      
   "Battle Los Angeles" cool.   

    If "Battle Los Angeles"     
       was zero cool and        

       "Independence Day"       
          was 10 cool,          

        then this would         
       be about a 7 cool!       

        I am Abin Sur...        

         It's a 9 cool.

        never know what         

          "Hal Jordan"          
       means in English.        

       What's this mean?        

      It's glowing, and it

 If you are attacked, the ring  
 will respond to your thoughts  

        and imagination         
        to protect you.

I'm not sure that the Earthlings
      are worthy of a ring.

           Why, yes,            
       it <i>is</i> hot in here!

     Tyler, I told you not      
     to play ball in here!      

   I'm so sorry, Mr. Luthor.    

  I-it's my day to watch him.

          What, uh --           
     what's going on here?      

        Okay, just to be        
       completely clear,        

    all we're gonna do is go    
  over to the Hall of Justice,  

       plant a nega-bomb,       
   and kill them all at once.   

       That's it, right?        

            Exactly.            

    And we're sneaking over     
    at night when it's dark,    

      like Sinestro said.       

          Great idea,           
            'Nestro.            

 And it never hurts to leave a  
few riddles with embedded clues 

   on how to defuse the bomb.   

          Right, gang?          

  Look, Eddie, we're not doing  
  the "riddle" thing anymore.   

You don't have to get your dick 
 prints over everything we do.  

   But without my riddles, I    
might as well not even show up. 

             Fine!              

       Riddle me this --        
   which losers are gonna be    

     totally jealous when <i>I</i>     
  <i>defeat the JLA without them?</i>  

         It's <i>you</i> guys!         

       "Riddle me this --

       Then the Exclaimer       
         must be near.          

         The Exclaimer?         

    Wait. Can we hit "pause"    
       here for a second?       

   Pausing is <i>my</i> game, flash.

     of the Legion of Doom!     

    Ga-goo! Krrkrr! Krrshoo!    

   L-look, I-I don't want to    
   hurt your feelings, but --   

    I have the code's to the    
 watchtower's service entrance. 

      But welcome aboard!       

      [ thunder crashes ]       

          [ laughter ]          

      [ thunder crashes ]       

      What the [bleep] is       
      going on out there?       

    I left my windows down!     

     [ door opens, closes ]     

   No, our documents say you    
 were born on August 15, 1865,  

           a Tuesday.           

           [ roars ]            

  It should also be noted that  
   your actual legal name is    

       Solomon Gruesday.        

              Ah!               

      Hey, guys! I'm back!      

       Where have I been?       

Oh, King of the ocean business, 
           you know.            

     Didn't join the forces     
      of evil or anything.      

      You get the cake for      
      Robin's Bar Mitzvah?      

              Yep.              

      That's all I'm good       
          for, right?           

             Ta-da!             

         And there goes         
        our petty cash.         

           [ sighs ]            

        Better too much         
    than too little, right?     

   Why, this one's so big...    

        he's blowing it.        

       Riddle me this --        
      whose hand is that?       

  Mine's between two pillows.   

     Yeah, we heard you the     
   first three times, Grodd.    

   We've all seen the movie.    

           Actually,            
      I've never seen it,       

       but that joke was        
        in the trailer.         

          Va-va-va...           

      Fine. Let's just get      
      it in the rec room.       

           Surprise!            

     I didn't do anything!      

         What is this?          

        It's an Aquaman         
      appreciation party!       

             Yeah!              
      Robin's not Jewish!       

        Oh, we give you         
          a hard time,          

        but only because        
       we love you, bro!        

   You really feel that way?    

      Do I really feel --       

       Look at this guy!        
           Of course!           

        We're a family.         

       Now do the honor.        

      [ heroes cheering ]       

  Shh! Something's happening.   

         Yeah, Aquaman!         
         In the house!          

      Hey! Hey, hey, hey!       

        Quiet, you fool!        

         But, but, but,         
        but, but, but --        

         I said quiet!          

              Aah!              

     I told you to -- wait.     

They're shoving knives in here? 

      Get out of the cake!      

        [ heroes gasp ]         

       We've been caked!        

    Wait, wait, wait, guys.     
      My legs are asleep.       

        Now they'll see         
     what Mr. Banjo can do.     

 [ up-tempo banjo music plays ] 

            Face it,            
          green fool!           

      You're no match for       
       the power of fear!       

             Whoa!              

        I can't look at         
         you like that.         

       Was that a choice?       

    I got a staph infection!    

         I almost died!         

              Ow!               

    Who brought a kickball?!    

    Am I here? Or over here?    

       How will you know        
      which is the real --      

          Face punch.           

           Oh, yeah!            

              Ugh!              

     See you next Gruesday!     

           - Freeze!            
            - Chill!            

             - Ice!             
           - Freeze!            

            - Cool!             
           - Freeze!            

             - Meh!             
             - Ow!              
             - Oh!              

       Yeah, I'm dropping       
        mother [bleep]!         

          Who's next?!          

  I'd fight you, Wonder Woman,  
      but I've got a dick.      

              Ow!               

           Oh, great.           

      Like I was drowning       
    in cooch to start with.     

    Now I've got a nose like    
     a [bleep] can opener.      

              Eh.               

           [ sighs ]            

              Oh!               

             Mm...              

          [ smooches ]          

       Was I supposed to        
        fight Darkseid?         

        'Cause I'm a guy        
         in a cat suit.         

       Give it up, Joker.       

           You'll n--           
            Ugh! Ow!            

           Is that --           
      is that piss, dude?       

      Did you just squirt       
       piss in my mouth?        

        Oh, we are done         
        professionally!         

              Hah!              
    It's not <i>his</i> piss, bats.    

          That is only          
        slightly better.        

              Aah!              

      Aah, rule of three,       
       asshole, not four!       

            Ow, man!            

       Hey, now! Oh! Ohh!       

    I can't concentrate with    
     that damn banjo noise!     

        [ music stops ]         

      Fine. Suck on this.       

              Aah!              

           Yet again,           
  the world's greatest villain  

   and Earth's mightiest hero   
  must do the dance of death.   

         Mother [bleep]         

       that split my lip!       

        Enough of this!         

     Time for the endgame.      

   Aquaman, the kryptonite --   
              Now!              

          Kryptonite?           

    Throw me the kryptonite,    
       and evil will win!       

              No!               
     Aquaman, I'm your bro!     

   Bro? You treated him like    
    pond scum for too long.     

    Now he has his revenge.     

         Sorry, Luthor.         

        I'm no villain.         

          I'm a hero.           

         And I'm gonna          
         kick your ass!         

           Aquapunch!           

             Yeah!              

        Aquaman gets his        
          groove back!          

       Oh [bleep] how can       
     you measure the value      

        of a man who did        
      so much for so many?      

        And what will we        
        do without him,         

           without...           

             Glenn?             

 This is how the "Robot Chicken 
    DC Comics Special" ends,    

           with some            
      cheap-ass misdirect?      

      We're not even gonna      
   find out how you survived?   

           Everyone's           
        okay with this?         

              Shh.              
      Don't worry, Jimmy.       

           You won't            
       remember a thing.        

          [ smooches ]          

     And neither will you.      

          [ smooches ]          

       â™ª You can try and        
         fight me off â™ª         

         â™ª But I-I'm a          
        m-man of steel â™ª        

      â™ª I'm gon' kiss you,      
            homes â™ª             

        â™ª And you won't         
       remember a thing â™ª       

         Hmm. You know,         
  the thing about Glenn was --  

          Oh! Damn it!          

       â™ª But I don't want       
      to kiss your thing â™ª      

          [ laughing ]          

            AQUAMAN:            
     Another job well done!
