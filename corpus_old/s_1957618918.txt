[electronic beeping]

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

Ah!

â™ª I'm full of nothing â™ª

â™ª Big little nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm full of nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

[electronic 
 beeping]

He has been
on that damn thing

for over an hour.

[slams down money]

I'm out of quarters.
Can I get some more?

Sorry, dear.
We are fresh out.

Got no more quarters?

â™ªâ™ª [juke box 
 plays country western]

You can't just take 'em
out of the machine?

Well, the owner
has the key.

And besides, we prefer
to listen to the music

this early in the morning.

 â™ª I'm goin' under â™ª

â™ª 'Round the ending blues â™ª

Hell.

Cover your dollar?

Yeah, it's all right.

[truck horn blasts]

You've got
a lot of plates.
Goin' to Vegas?

Gotta drop off
these eggs first.

I can give you
a hand.

Ain't lookin'
for no handouts.

Ah.

All right.

Get in.

â™ª I'm goin' under â™ª

â™ª Gettin' over the hill â™ª

[cash register bell dings]

[coin falls into game slot]

â™ªâ™ª [percussion]

Howdy.
Yeah. Hi.

20 bucks' worth
of quarters, please.

Here you are.

Thank you kindly.

I'm on my way to Charlotte.

Gotta make some money
so I can get there.

I'm gonna be
a race car driver.

That's nice.

Well...

Hope you're a winner.

Thank you.

Hmm.

[man, laughing]
All right!

Yeah!

All right! Yeah!

 Yes! Okay!

All right.
Can I get
a bucket?


No way. No way.
No fucking way!

You a guest
in the hotel, sir?

Yes, I am.

Gotta go around
the front entrance.
Aw, come on, be cool.

I just got--
No, sir.

...fucking robbed!

Hell!

â™ª Bang, bang, bang â™ª

â™ª You gotta read 
 the campaign, boy â™ª

â™ª Ohh ohh â™ª

â™ª Bang, bang, bang â™ª

â™ª You gotta read 
 the campaign, boy â™ª

â™ª Whoa-oa â™ª

â™ª Bang, bang, bang, 
 you gotta-- â™ª

[car door closes]
Hi.

I'm sorry
to bug you. Um...

I just had all
my money ripped off
by this chick

who I thought was cool,
and it turned out
she wasn't,

and so I-- I need
enough to, uh...

Please. Okay,
I need-- I need,
like, 20 bucks.

And it would
really help. Just--

I'll work for you.
All right? I'll--
I'll mow your lawn.

I'll paint your house.
Whatever you need.

[starts motor]
Anything.

[boy laughs]

Loser.


Believe in love
at first sight?

I'll come back again.

No. How about this one?

You wanna go
for a doughnut and a fuck?

What? You don't like
doughnuts?

See, pickup lines
that work for reals.

I don't know
what you're trying to do
with this lady right here,

but it didn't look
like it was working.

Well, here's
another good one.

Simple,
straightforward,

and usually
works the best.

Just ask a person
for a cig.

Like this.

Uh, excuse me.

Do you have
an extra cig?

Uh...no.

Oh.

Here you go.

Then you, uh, talk
about whatever bullshit
comes to mind,

like, uh, pollution.

Need a light?

I don't smoke.

Can I have it back?

I wish I was.

Not a smoker.

I practically
spend all my money

on cigarettes, anyways.

It's bad, huh?

Non-smoker.

That's cool.

You're with friends
or family?

By myself. I'm, uh...

[clears throat]
I'm trying to get
to North Carolina.

But I lost
all my money here, so--

Where'd
you lose it?

Well, actually,
it was stolen...

by this fucking chick.


You got jacked?

By a chick?

Oh, that's the worst.
That's the worst.

I'm gonna get a job
tomorrow, though.

Um, me and my friends
are just kicking it
over here...

if you want to, um...
come by and see
what's going on.

I guess.

Eric.

Johnny.

[tires screeching]

Yo, what's up?

Man, someone gonna pop
your little gangsta ass,

walking around
like a fool in shit.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Who's gonna do it?
You, motherfucker?

That's right.
I'll bring your
nappy ass down.

Welcome to Vegas,
motherfucker.

[squirt, squirt, squirt]

Shit.

[girl laughs]

[boys chuckle]

Damn, fool!

Yeah, ha, ha, ha!

That's real funny!


How did you
like it, huh?

Huh?

Huh?

Don't ever point
that shit in my face
again!

Got it?

Where you score
this shit at?

I borrowed it
from Toy World.

Had to spray it black
'cause it was all orange
and shit.

Ooh. Hey.
Where'd you score
the fat lowrider, Scoob?

It's a loaner.

Let's cruise.

Do I look like
a fucking taxi to you?

Is there, like, a dome
and shit on top

that says "Scooby gives
free rides" and shit?

I don't think so.

Yo, get
in the fucking
car, Pez Boy.

All aboard!
There's plenty
of room.

Hey. Johnny.

Come with us.

You know...

Nah. I can't. I can't.

Hold on, kiddies.

â™ªâ™ª [rap]

â™ª I wanted you 
 to see me, shit â™ª

â™ª If you like me, 
 I'm the ugly side â™ª

â™ª Of a glamorous life â™ª

â™ª And I'm the dull side â™ª

â™ª Of a sharp knife â™ª

[tires screeching]
Hoser!

â™ª Swim past the fire â™ª

â™ª The less I wanna be â™ª

â™ª The more I wanna hit â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [rap fading]

Hey.

You hungry?

You want some--
some breakfast?

My mom makes
the best waffles.

First...takes
a layer of batter.

Puts it
in the grill. Right?

Takes a layer
of peanut butter.
Puts that on top.

Another layer of batter.
Closes it up.

And when it comes out,
it's all crispy
on the outside,

but it's, like, gooey
and peanut-buttery
on the inside.

It's totally awesome.

I think
she invented it.

How old are you?

How old do you
think I am?

I'd guess, uh, 17.

19, tops.

No, man.

Look.

This says you're 31.

Oh, shit.

Yeah. It's all fucked up.

Well,
I'm old enough to vote.


You want some of this?

No.

Breakfast's
my favorite meal.

My mom used to make a...

big breakfast for me
every Saturday morning.

Where do you live?

Uh, Ft. Irwin.

Before that, Ft. Benning.
Before that, Ft. Knox.

Ft. Knox
had the best women.

I live in Henderson.

You want to see
my home?

Is it cool?

Oh, it's beautiful.

All paid for.

Thanks, but, you know...

I can't. I really can't.

And thanks for breakfast,
too.

But I gotta go
find a job today.

It sucks, yeah.

What-- What do you do?

Whatever pays.

Y-You don't say?

Well, I have some work

that needs to be done
on my home.

Perhaps we could
go there right now
and take a look.

I don't know.

Um...I really got
to, uh...

make some money,
fast, you know,

'cause I gotta
get to Charlotte,
North Carolina.

By this weekend. I'm gonna
be a race car driver. So--

Is this something

you've done before?

Sorta.

And...you need money

to get
to the race track.

I-- I follow you.

Well, I could
pay you well
for your labor.

Really.

Mmm.

Well, I mean...

as long as
you're paying me.

You know? As long
as I'm working for it.

I don't want no handouts.

Mmm, check.

You know, you wouldn't
believe the people

that I've met
since I've been here.

Bunch of losers.


Normally,
I don't trust anybody...

over 25.

And I can tell
you're at least 30.

But, uh...

uh, you seem cool.
You know, you seem
all right.

I appreciate that,
Johnny.

And I appreciate
your honesty.

And believe me,
I know what
you've been thinking

this entire time.
But you're wrong.

There are factors
involved here.

Hygiene, for one.

There's also the matter
of politics--

sex-- sexual politics,
which I don't care
to be a part of.

So what
I'm trying to say

is that every person
has a special thing
about them

that makes them
who they are.
Do you follow me?

Yeah.

For instance,
you...are honest.

And that one thing
makes you who you are.

I tip well.
That's my one thing.

But we're also alike

in that we both
have special interests

that other people
don't have.

Uh, you want
to race cars,
Johnny.

And me?

Well, I'm...I'm

into something else.

I'll...

help you do
your thing

if you help me
do my thing.

Sound like a plan?

Stop the car.

Now, there's no need
to jump to conclusions.

Stop the fucking car!
All I want--

[tires screeching]

Uh, my stuff!
Stop! Stop!

Hell, you pervert!

Fuck!

Perverts and liars
and there's nothing
fucking left!

You wouldn't believe

what that guy
wanted me to do.

It was so disgusting!
I can't even--

I can't even believe it.
 He-- He wanted me to--


He wanted me...

Sit and bark
like a bitch?

God!

Don't even say it!

Uhh!

Yeah, that's Russel.

Big-time king.

What,
you know that guy?

Yeah. How much
was he gonna pay you?

Look, I didn't ask!
Hell, whatever it was,

it wasn't enough!

He was-- I--

I knew I shouldn't've 
trusted him.

I knew it. He was--
It-- He was 40.
At least 40.

God!

So, what are you
gonna do?

I don't know.

I don't know.
I'm total--
I'm fucked.


You wanna
hang out tonight?

Why? What do you
fucking want from me?

Nothing.

Just-- Just
thought you want--

might want to hang out
or something.

That's all.

[soft chatter]

[girl laughing]

[girl laughs]

It's not funny.

I'm in love.

All right,
it's obvious
the Pez Boy

has mad feelings
for this woman.

Damn right.

Wait. Is this the one
from that party?

Yeah, the last
desert party.

Her name's Tracy,
and she's totally the bomb
in every way.

She's a raver, like me.

Her favorite fruit
is gummy peaches,
like me.

And we both think
happy hardcore's
the ultimate.

But she's older.

I think she wants
to hang out,
but I can never tell

'cause she's always
fronting, dude.

How old is she?

She's 18
and a total hottie.

I've seen her.

I'd say she's a nottie.

Shut up, Eric!

Johnny.

How you living?

[girl laughs]




Uh...

doing all right.

No, man.

You gotta say
something cool.

Like what?

Like "Living large."

Chillin'
like a villain.

See, Johnny,

you got two things
to pick from.

"Living large"
and "Chillin'
like a villain."

So, Johnny...

how you living?

Uh...

Living like a villain.


Hey.

[laughter stops]

Evening, losers.

Oh, shit. it's
only the president.

Get fucked in the ass
tonight, Eric?

Yeah, by your dad.

Bitch came twice.


Ladies. You don't
mind, do you?
No.

So, what are you boys
up to tonight?

Nothing illegal,
I hope.

Oh, no.

Scoob,
you got a sec?

Naturally.

Hey, yo, yo, yo.


Check it.
Try and say "toy boat"

ten times really fast.

Toy boat, toy boat.
Toy boat, toy boat.

Toy boat, toy boat,
toy boat.

Toy boat, toy boat,

Toy boat.
You see, dude?

I want some, Steve.

The hell with that.

Toy boat.
Toy boat.

No way.

Haven't you guys got
some homework to do?

So, uh, Steven. Why
aren't you kicking it

at that rich trick's
place you keep
bragging about?

Because I had
other business

to attend to
tonight.

The streets
are changing,
man.

Those fucking Metro cops
are everywhere.

Someone's putting pressure
on those motherfuckers

to jack the shit
out of us.
I don't know who,

but the shit's
getting serious.

I need a change
of scenery.

I'm thinking
about heading back
to La La Land.

What's
stopping you?

Some of us are making
too many duckies

to bail
at the present time.

But this bullshit
with the local law
enforcement

is seriously cutting down
on my disposable income.

What are you
so worried about?

You're gonna be
famous, right?

Working it as we speak.

Steve's gonna buy

a big house
in the desert

so he can
party every
fucking day.

by the pool,
baby.

Right.
Did I ever
tell you

about that time
that rich trick
dragged me

out to that
crazy-ass pool party?

Bitch didn't even
want to fuck me.

Just wanted to hang out.
Picture me, sitting around,

buncha queens sipping
strawberry daiquiris,
piÃ±a coladas.

It was beautiful.
Scored a $200 tip
that night.

Wow.
Tell him

we need beer.

Oh. We need beer.

Somebody
hook us up?

I'll go.
Go to a place

behind the Flamingo
parking structure.

The Korean guy's down.

Need a fake I.D.


All right.

Hey, I'm-a--
I'm-a go, too.

Cold weather's
bad for your kidneys.
Know that?

No.

I'm gonna die
if I don't get 
a six soon.

I'm gonna die
if I don't eat
something soon.

Hey, who--
who's that cute chick

sitting by Scooby?

Which one?

The real cute one.

Oh, that's--
that's Kelley.

She's a hottie.

I want to throw
a beat so bad. Uhh!


Hey, what was up
with that one guy, too?

Steven?
The dickhead?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
Did he really do

all that shit--
Whassup, fools?

Whassup,
J.T.?

Not a damn thing.

Who's this?
Whassup?

Oh, this is--
This is Johnny
from last night.

He's down.

You better be.

Jason Torres.

Hey, yo. J.T.

With cash money.
Got that?

Yeah, all right.

You got that?

What's up, men?
You guys hungry?
Thirsty?

Hey, I thought I told you
not to come in here anymore.

Go grab some of them bags
over there, man.

Whatever you want.
It's on me.

Get outta here!
I'm calling the cops!

I'm calling right now!

Hey! Now, I've
told you before!

You get the fuck
outta here!

Oh, fuck you, man!
I'm thirsty.
No, fuck you!

Fuck you!
I'm calling the cops!

I'm calling
the cops right now!

Hey, yo, man, O.E. cool?

Get your punk-ass
friends outta here!

You two! Get outta here!
Right now, God damn it!

I'm calling
the goddamn cops.

I'm calling 'em
right now!

Get the fuck
outta here!

Where the hell
you think you're going?

Whoo!
Sorry! I can't resist
jackin' Chang!


Hey, I don't know
if you can
crash here tonight,

but you're totally welcome
to stay at my place
if you want.

Cool.
Thanks.

[keys jingling]

Eric. Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

It's not a good
night tonight.

Larry's
gonna be off.

Can we just--
just hang out?

Uh...

Yeah. Come on.

H-- I'm Johnny.
Hi.

Hi.
Yeah, that's--
that's Johnny.

[telephone rings]

Oh. Uh...

make yourselves
at home.

Hey, Johnny,
come here.

Let me
show you something.

Hello?

Oh. Larry.
Hi.

That's my mom.

Wow. That's cool.

Where's she at?

Oh, shit!

I forgot
to buy smokes.

In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

Listen.
I love you.

Look, I do!

I do. Uh, Larry,
please. Come back.

You're a new face
around here.

How come you're
not in school?

Dropped out.

School sucks.

Where you from?

Ft. Irwin.
Before that,
Ft. Ben,

and before that,
Ft. Knox.

Ft. Knox had
the hottest women.

My dad's a colonel,
so...

It was kinda like
being in the army, so...

I got sick of taking
shit. I left.

What kinda shit?

Telling you what
to do all the time.

Telling you
how messed up you are.

Shit like that.

You know?

So you decided
it was time to leave
for good?

That's right.

[cups clunking]

Got any brothers
or sisters?

I got a sister.
She's younger.

She's one of the reasons
why I want to be
a race car driver.

I want to be able
to take care of her.
She's deaf.

Gonna be
a race car driver?

Yep. Stock cars.

That's why I want
to go to Charlotte.

That's where all
 the best people are.

I'm gonna work for, uh,
Richard Petty's team.

He's the best.

So you figured
you'd just come
into town,

make some
quick money,

and be on your way.

Kind of.

At least you can do
whatever you want here.

That's cool.
Is it? [snickers]

Definitely. My dad didn't
give a shit about me.

Now I can do
what I want.

So I'm making money,
and I'm going to Charlotte.

And that's it.

How're you
gonna do that?

Make money?

Do whatever
I gotta do.

Do what Steven does.

Yeah, he doesn't even
know what Steven does.

So what? I'm tired
of being taken
advantage of.

I'm not dumb.
I can make money.

Just like anybody else.
I'm gonna.

Johnny, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

You sound like
my fucking parents.

I just don't want you
to get jacked, idiot.

I know what I'm doing!

I stole some jimmies
from that store
and everything.


If somebody wants me
to do something

that I don't
want to do,

I'll just leave.
That's it. No big deal.

I want to tell you
a story, Johnny.

Right after I had
to stop dancing,

I went through
some really bad times.

This was
before my boyfriend

pulled me
out of all that shit
and saved my life.

But I thought the way
that you do now.

I thought I'd make
some easy money,

get a lot
of attention.

It was like that
for a while, too.

Anyway, this one night,
I was picked up
by this guy

in this brand-new
Ford Explorer.

It was
a really nice car.
You know?

He was in his late 30s,

and he said
that he was in town
for a couple of days

for some big computer
software convention

and he wanted
to have a good time.

So I asked him
what he was into,

and he said that he was
into killing people.

I didn't pay attention
to what he said

'cause I knew
the guy was drunk.

He had a bunch of vials
in the backseat, and...

Anyway, uh, you know...

I figured he was
just trying to scare me.

I...heard that kind
of thing before.

Some people get off
on that kind of thing--

fear.

Makes 'em horny.

So I asked the guy, um,
where we were gonna go.

And he said that
it was a surprise,

and I said I really
didn't like surprises,

and that I'd feel
a lot better if he
just pulled over.

But he didn't.

So I, uh...

I knew he was
heading up the strip

towards the freeway,
and I had to do
something pretty quick,

so I told the guy
that I was a junkie

and if I didn't get
a fix real soon,

that I was gonna throw up
all over his brand-new
beautiful car.

And that did it.
So he pulls
into this little place

behind the gas station.

[teapot whistles]

So anyway,
I tell the guy

that I'm feeling
a little better

but that I still
need to fix up.

And he says okay,

but that he would like
to see what I look like
down there.

So he tells me
to lean back
and relax,

which I did.
And he tells me
to close my eyes,

which I did.

I don't even
really remember
what happened

that clearly,
but I was just--
I was

kicking him
and punching him
and hitting him.

And then I pushed
the door open on the car,

and then I started
running down the street.

I don't even remember
when I stopped,

but when I did stop,
I looked down,

and I noticed that
my jacket was torn.

And I look inside, and
there was blood everywhere.

I'd been stabbed
in the chest,

and I didn't
even know it.

I guess there was
so much adrenaline

pumping through my veins
that it took the pain away.

They told me
that the knife
had hit a rib

and that if it
had just been
a little higher,

it would've
cut my heart.

I figured the guy missed
'cause he was drunk.

You never told me
that story, Veronica.

I haven't told you
a lot of stories.

Anyway.

It's late.
I'm gonna hit the sack.

Nice to meet you, Johnny.

Nice to meet you.

Good night, boys.

Good night.

[door opens]

The Apollo 11 spacecraft

thrusts into space.

The total payload 
 is equivalent

to 4,000 pounds, 
 and it's--

[changes channel]

â™ªâ™ª [music]

[changes channel]


What the hell?

What?

What, are you gay
or something?

Well, I--
I wouldn't--
I wouldn't say that.

I knew it.

Fuck. I knew it!
You--


You want to get
busy with me.

That's
why you helped me.

God, I'm so dumb!

No, it's not
like that at all.

I-- I-- I just--
I just thought--


I'm-- I'm sorry.

I'm leaving.

Everybody here wants
to take advantage of me

and have sex with me,
so fuck everybody!

I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna make money

however I can.
I'm getting
to Charlotte,

and that's--

you lied to me.

I didn't!

You never asked me
if I liked girls!

[TV audio]

[approaching
footsteps]

[Man on TV] 
 A roasted pig 
 on a 'cue.

[man throws
keys down]

[opens door]

[door closes]

That's...Larry.

Veronica's
boyfriend.

He's a--
He's Metro cop.

Actually,
after he busted her
for prostitution,

they started going out.

So it's...it's
all really secret.

[TV dialog]

You're the weirdest
people I've ever met
in my whole life.

Johnny!



â™ª I gotta get myself 
 out of this place â™ª

â™ª Let you go to outer space â™ª

â™ªâ™ª [continues, indistinct]

[girl sobbing]



You okay?

Yeah.

You want some help
or something?

No. I'm-- I'm fine.
I just-- [sniffles]

I just, um...

I just got married.

Wow. [chuckles]

Well, congratulations.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Uh...hell, I was
worried for a second.

You looked so sad
a minute ago.

I was. But, um...

But I'm okay now.





[both laughing]

Oh...[laughs]

I was viral.

I'm-- I'm
 Wilma Garrett Price.

I'm-- I'm really sorry
for the display earlier.

Wilma.

Like The Flintstones. 
Yeah.

[both laugh]

Johnny.
It's nice to meet you.

Wait. Wait a second.
What time do liquor stores
close around here?

It's about 4
in the morning, right?

Uh...I--
'Cause I plan
to drink

about a thousand
wine coolers, so I--
I'd better run.

It was nice
talking to you.
Yeah.

Bye. [chuckles]

Do you drink
wine coolers?

When Pete's unit
got back two days ago,

he had already
made up his mind

without even talking to me
that right now

was the time
to officially tie the knot.

I mean, I wanted to
a year ago, but...

wasn't the right time
for him, so...

when he said,
"Let's do it,"

I mean, what was
I supposed to say?

"Let's wait
another year"?

Hell, no. I mean,
he had three days' leave.

Can you imagine that?
Three days,

and he's
right back out again.

I mean, I didn't have time
to prepare one little bit!

When we got
to the chapel
this morning,

there was all
these couples lined up.

[knocks bottle over]

So embarrassing.

See, I always
thought that...

when I finally married
the man that I love...

that it would be
something really special.

Not like this.
Not Las Vegas.

I mean, our families
weren't even invited.

'Course,
his buddies were here.

And to top it off,
they-- they insisted

on having
the bachelor party

and our honeymoon
on the same night.

Of course, the--
the party on the lake

was much more important
than spending the night
with his bride.

I mean, who cares
if we already live
together?

He didn't even
ask me how I felt.

And the funny thing
is that I...

I could live
without a fancy wedding.

I really could.

I just wanted us
to be alone tonight.

If you ever
get sick of him...

you come
to North Carolina
and live with me.

You're such an angel.

You really are.

Thank you.

I'm so glad we met,
Wilma.

Ever since I got here,
it's just been the worst
time of my life.

I got all my stuff
stolen.

All the people I've met,
every one of them,

has been crazy
in some way.

See? See?

This is what
I'm talking about.

He's been earning
hazardous duty pay
for months,

and what does he do
when he has time
to spend it?

Just leaves it right here
on the dresser.


I don't want to talk
about him no more.

Sure.

When's he getting back?

He's supposed to
have the boat in
by sundown tomorrow.

So we have plenty of time.

Do you want to...

take yours off now?



I'm all yours.

What do you
want me to do?

Well,
whatever you prefer.

I-- I trust you.

Just go slow
in the beginning, okay?

Okay.

Um...

I'm sorry. Uh...

It's been, like...

I just don't want
to mess anything up.

Well, why don't you start
by taking the rest
of your clothes off?

Sure.

Can I just
turn the light out?

If you want.

[bang, thud]

Hey, honey.

Let's...fuck.

Um...

Pete, uh, no.

No. No. No, no.
No, Pete. Pete.

Wait. Pete. Pete, no.
Wait. Wait, Pete.

It's your ass, honey!

Hi.
No! No!
Hi.

[Pete roars]

Oh, my God!
Come here,
you bastard!

Pete, no! No! Pete!
Unhh!

Pete!

Oh, shit!

Pete, stop it!

Stop it, Pete!
Pete, be nice to him!

Pete, no!

No! Let him go!
You're fucked, kid.

Airborne qualified, bud.

Pete, stop it!

Force recon!

Eat some dirt!

Pete! Pete!

No!

[shards clattering]

[hinges creaking]

[door closes]

Is breakfast ready, Mom?

[birds chirping]


Nothing that terrible
could be real. Huh.

What are you
doing here?

I...I live here.

This is my place.

You, uh...don't
remember nothing?

Total blackout, huh?

Well, you want to
see something funny?

Look.


That's not funny.

I've seen worse.

Where's my shirt?

I tossed it.

You tossed my shirt?

Oh, you should've
seen it.

All covered
with barf bits

and blood samples
and shit.

Really gross.

The smell of vinegar
tutti-frutti, too.

Uhh!

Before I woke up,
I was dreaming

that I was at home...

and my mom
made me breakfast.

It was so realistic.

You want breakfast?

I got
this cereal here.

I, uh...picked it up
because it has

a race car driver
on the front.

Ricky Rudd.
He's good.

You don't have to eat now
if you don't want to.

I could try.

Here you go.

[packaging
rattles]

Uh, that's what you
put your bowl on...

like a platform.

Oh.

Here you go.

I got you
a spoon here.

Oh, don't worry.
It's clean.

I jacked it
from MacDougal's
last night.

I wasn't sure

what kind of milk
you wanted,

so I...I got you
lowfat.

It's-- You know,
it's usually
a safe bet.

But I can't drink
milk 'cause I got
that lactose disease

and I might die.

Eric.

I just want to say...

um...

I'm sorry
for what I said.

All right?

I really appreciate you
helping me out
and everything.

Ahh,
it's no problem.

I mean, I don't really
think you're weird
or whatever.


I mean,
you never know.

I mean, I could try
knocking on you
right here.


Yeah, I forgot
about that.

You know, I don't
really remember...

anything. It's bizarre.

Like...how
did I get here...

and stuff?
What happened, exactly?

Oh, You mean after
you got beat down?

Yeah.
Melanie and Kelley
found you.

And they got me,
and we brought you
back here...

like, two days ago.

Two days?


How long
have you lived here?

Uh...uh,
two months, I think.

I get bored being
in the same place.

Like to move
around a lot.

You go camping?


No. Actually, I like
to have extra chow.

Just in case.

Like, if I had
an accident...

I couldn't work
anymore...

I like to know
I won't starve.

Or for holidays.

Definitely
for holidays.

Plus...Plus,
I like soup.

I mean,
soup's a bomb.

Very healthy.

Yeah,
very healthy.

I mean, with
crackers, of course.

You gotta have
the crackers

with tomato soup.

Oh, my God,
it's the best.

I mean, I don't
even need to be sick
to eat that crap.

Is there, like,
a place around here
with real cheap rent

that I could stay at
while I'm working?

What do you mean?

You can
kick it here.

No, I can't st--
I can't stay. You
have one-- one bed.

No.

No, it's no--
it's no problem.

I'll just sleep
on the floor.

On the floor?
No way! This is your--
This is your place.

Really.
I don't mind.

I'll just-- just
spread out my clothes,

and I'll sleep
on top of them.

Actually, it's
a lot more comfortable
than the mattress.

Really. You should
kick it here.

[distant siren]

All right,
I'll stay.

But as soo--
as soon as I make
some money,

I'm gonna pay you back.
All right?

Yeah.
 All right.

[traffic roars by]

All right. This is
a major cruise area,
right here.

Kinda sucks for me
'cause guy tricks
are totally opposite.

Inexperienced and youth
is what they're
looking for mostly.

Sometimes I think
they're like vampires

searching for
the Fountain of Youth.

It's draining.

It's fucking draining.

I mean, I feel
so old sometimes.

But you know, I gotta
keep looking young

and inexperienced
for the tricks,

which won't last forever.

Maybe you should
switch to girls.

Yeah, right. Hmhh.

You're really just not
attracted to girls
at all, huh?

Not even just
a little bit?
Not even for money?

Nope.

Man.

I don't
get it, man.

I don't
get it.

Well, like I said,
this is a major
fucking cruise area,

so--
Yeah. All right.

You gotta keep
that in mind.
All right.

I really looked
horrible?

Fuck, yeah.

â™ªâ™ª [pop beat]

Oh,
check it out.
What?

Steven just scored.

â™ª I look at you 
 when you talk â™ª

â™ª But I don't seem to hear 
 a single word you speak â™ª

â™ª I wish I was 
 a little bit â™ª

â™ª New and change this â™ª

Whassup, Steven?

â™ª ...Show my feelings â™ª

â™ª Just a little bit more â™ª

â™ª My face is made 
 out of stone â™ª

â™ª I got... â™ª

This...is what
the fuck's up.

I scored
big time.

Oh. You're the kid

who got the beat-down,
huh?

Phew. Can't even
fucking imagine, bro.

Keep your head up.

So, uh, Steven.

Since you're
Mister Big Time

on the strip
these days,

I thought you could
give young Johnny here

some tips on how to score
the straight women.

Well, you've come
to the right place.

Cops are stupid, Johnny.
Keep that in mind.

When a woman
picks you up,

first thing, start by checking
the rearview mirror.

There'll always be
at least one cop watching

if it's any kind
of sting at all.

Ask her to make
a couple turns.
They hate that shit.

And also say shit, like,

"What are you doing
out here on the street?

How long have you
been out here?"

You know,
acting all concerned.

Then they'll
grab your dick,

and you know what I do
when they do that?

I look at 'em
right in the eyes
and I say,

"Suck it, baby."

So either they do,

or they pull the fuck
over real quick.
You see, Johnny,

real tricks are
way too afraid to do
anything at all.

Also, never, ever
be the first one
to bring up money.

That's what
those fucking cops
are waiting to hear,

and that's when
they jack your ass.

They don't
bring it up, they know

they're playing you,
and you don't

have time
for that shit.

You see...
most women

are beautiful,
sensitive,
little flowers

who have been forced
into paying for sex

by their small-dicked,

pussy-ass
little husbands.

By breaking the law,

they're getting back
at that asshole.

Or...she could be
a horny bitch.


So, uh...you completely
straight or what?

'Course. Yeah.
Aren't you?

Well...
personally...

I dig women.

But...when
it comes to work,

it's simply a matter
of cash flow.

You see,
Steven's bisexual.

"Bi" him something,
and he'll have sex.


I'm a businessman,
Johnny.

The customer
always comes first.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

[Man, distantly]
Freeze! Don't go
any further!

Hey, stop!

Hey, whassup? Who's--
Hey, hold this.

Hey, you kids.
Did you just see

a short Mexican kid
run through here?

Uh, yeah.
He want
that way.

No. Shit.
Yeah.

Go, partner.
Go. Go, go.

Go, go!
 Go, go!

Jesus H. Christ.
Go, go, go, go, go!

Go. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Go. Go. Go. Go!

I'm getting too old
for this shit.

Hey, he had
a gun, too!

Fucking suckers.

Oh, man. Uhh.

Sun's way too bright
in the morning.

Mmm...

[Johnny breathes
irregularly]

You okay?

Feel like I'm gonna
throw up.

You smoked a lot
of cigs last night.


Hey, what was in that bag
that J.T. threw to you?

Johnny.

â™ªâ™ª [Latin American beat]

[distant siren]


Nice car, Scoob.

What's up, Mickey?

Yeah.

What's up,
Trish?
Hey.

New car, Scoob?

Yeah. You like it?

Yeah.

So, I heard you
got beat down.

I quote Tupac:
"Keep your head up.

Don't get fed up."

[sighs disgustedly]

Garth Brooks.

U2.

Slade.

Madonna.

Give her to me,
Scooby.

[sighs disgustedly]
Take it.

Any other CDs
down there?

Oh, dope.

Let's go
for a ride,
kids.

Shotgun.

Hey, Johnny.
This is

Mickey and Trish.

Hello.
Hello.


[tires screeching]

[tires screeching]

[tires screeching]

Guys, we roll
with this item.

Yo, Scoob,
where we going?

The desert.

Cool.

Here. You want
a cigarette, Johnny?

Yeah.

Light?

Hey, you gotta
pay for that!

Mickey, get your ass
back in this car!

Ohh! Damn it!

Come on,
little girl,
come on!

What are you doing
with my CDs, girl?
Come on!

Come on!

We got screwed,
Scooby!

Where we going?

Get us the hell
outta here!

Come on, Scooby,
get in this stupid car!

Just trust me, all right?
Get in the backseat.

Go! Go! Come on!
Come on, Scooby!

Drop it!
Please hurry!

Come on, Scooby,
let's go!


I'm calling the cops!

I'm gonna find you!
[tires screeching]

You and those other kids?
You better watch out

'cause I'm coming
after you!

Red light!

Oh, stupid bitch!

We're already
in a hot fucking auto!

But, no, that's not
good enough for you.

You gotta knock off
a fucking convenience
store, too?

Uhh!

Want a beer,
Scooby?

Without a doubt.

[tires screeching]

Whoo!
Ohh! Ohh!

What are you doing?

Aah! Slow down!

All right?
Oh, God!

On, no, no,.
no, no, no!

[all shouting at once]

Ohh!
[horn blares]

Oh, shit!

Johnny, Slow down!
Johnny!

[overlapping shouting]

If you're lucky!
[tires screeching]

Whoo!
Oh, shit!

Johnny!
Move the hell
over!

This is not funny!


Will you slow down?

Johnny!
Ohh!
[tires screeching]

[tires screeching]
Whoo!

It's not funny anymore!

I'll get you,
you little thief!
Whoo-hoo!

Stop
the fucking car!

Asshole!
Oww!


Whoo-ooh!
Ohh!

Oh, shit, Johnny.

Oh, spun out in front!

Oh, God! What are
you doing, Johnny?

Leave
this motherfucker!

[horn blares]

Come on, let's go!

[tires screeching]

Hee hee hee hee!
Come on!

Ohh! Aah! Come on!

Aaahh!

Yeah!

Ahh!
Go, go, go!

Fuck! Fuck!

[tires screeching]

Gahh!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

I'll knock off the asshole!
Pull over!

Ohh...
You're gonna
miss the light!

Go, go, go, go.

Ohhhh!
Go, Johnny, go!
Yeah!

[horn blares]
[tires screeching]

Oh, damn! I dig it!



Hey, John boy...
Yeah.

You can drive
my car anytime.

Thanks.

Last beer. Any takers?

Nah.
I'm cool.

Hey,
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

All right.

I'll come.

Coming,
Scoob?

Nah. I'm gonna
stay here

and smoke this
sticky shit.

All right.



So did you ever
have a girlfriend?

Yeah. Yeah, of course.

Did you?

Oh, yeah. [laughs]

Yeah, I forgot
about that.

When did you
first, uh...

like, realize?
You know,

when did you
first know
that you were...

Um, when I was
in the second grade,

I-- I kept trying
to kiss all the boys
in my classroom.


And, you know,
I got in trouble

all the time,
too.

But one day,

my teacher
called my mom in
for a conference

and told her
that I was confused

because I kept walking
into the girls'
bathroom.

And my mom, she, um,
she was totally
embarrassed

and didn't let me hang
with any other kids
in the neighborhood

for a long time.

You know. She--
She was just
really scared.

Anyways, my mom
left me when I was 10.

And I went to live
with some other people.

And it only got worse.

When was the first time
you boned a chick?

None of your business.

Come on.
I just told you

my whole personal
private experience.

It's no big deal.

I'll tell you
whatever you want
to know about me.

Don't want
to know nothing

about being...gay
or whatever.

Fine.

Just tell me,
and I won't
bug you anymore.

Was she--
Was she fat?
Was she skinny?

Uh, hairy?
Or hairless?

Or--
Shut up! I'll--

If you promise not
to tell anybody,
I will tell you.

All right?

Promise.

I have done...
stuff

with women before.

All right,
but I've never...

actually completely
gone all the way.

You're a virgin?

No. No.

I mean,
I wouldn't say that.

I'd-- Like I said,
I've done stuff
with girls before.

I mean, that should--
that should...

cancel out the fact
that I've never
completely...

you're still a virgin.

Shut up!
Maybe. Maybe.

And you want
to hustle women
for money?

Yeah.
Are you crazy?

Have you ever given
a woman an orgasm?

Yeah! Of course.
Yeah. I mean...

I don't know.
I don't-- I mean,
it was dark.

Shit. All right,
someday I'm gonna.

All right. Someday.


You know,
I'm gonna help you
find a real job.

Why?

Can I ask you
a question?

Why do you
want to be

a race car driver
so bad?

'Cause it's exciting.

'Cause it's just
you in the car.
You know?

'Cause...
'Cause you got a crew

that's, uh, always
looking out for you,

watching your back,
making sure
you don't get hurt.

'Cause you got
a bunch of fans
that love you

even though you lose
most of the time.

'Cause you make
lots of money

so you can
help other people
you care for.

'Cause you-- you--
you can't be a flake.

You gotta be dependable.
You gotta be there
all the time.

Yeah.

You know...

all I want
in life is...

is to find someone
I can care for

and...love...

and will be there
for me if I--

if I get sick
or injured.

That's all.

Yeah, I guess
that'd be cool, too.

Oh, my gosh!

Damn! It's cold!

You wanna go?

No.

But let's go.

[Johnny
grunts]

Hey, uh...you
got a cigarette,
partner?

Yeah, sure.

Oh, thanks.

I'm trying
to get me a trick.

Good for you.

There you go.

Oh, hey,
I'm-- I'm Bud.

Like the beer.

ain't got
nothing yet.

Nope.

Not a one.

I reckon,
uh, nobody wants

a real cowboy
in this town!

Damn fakes!

Hey, uh...
you like my hat?

Cool.

Yeah.

I like it, too.

You know why?

Well, uh...
'cause it holds

something
very special in it.

And, uh...[laughs]

I don't mean
my fancy mug,
neither.

What the hell!

Yeah! [laughs]

One dude
peed his drawers

when I zapped him.

Damn homo tried
to feel my butt.

You feel my butt--

Yep.

Put that away.

Shit!

Thanks
for the cigarette.

Vegas.

â™ªâ™ª [song intro]

â™ª Sees that each new step â™ª

â™ª Is somehow preordained â™ª

I'm in love with Johnny.

â™ª Have not traveled 
 this way â™ª

Does he know?

No.

Are you
gonna tell him?

Uh-uh.

Oh, you're
torturing yourself.

I know!

It's horrible.

This time it's worse
'cause I know
I'll never get him.

I don't know.
It's just constant
pain and anguish.

I don't know
what to tell ya.

Well, what would
my mom tell me?

that men aren't

worth spending
emotions on.

She was a pragmatist.

She believed
that relationships
come down to actions

and outcome
and everything else
is just bullshit.

I always wanted
to agree with her.

She just got fucked over
by too many men.

Yeah. Me, too.

But...you know
what sucks the most...

is that I...

I love someone
who will never,

ever feel the same way
about me.

You know?
Not even a chance.

It's the worst thing.

I need a favor.

Big one.

â™ª Because it's not â™ª

â™ª Been like this â™ª

â™ª Before â™ª

There's no one

if that's why
you're checking.

Uh...could you
just turn

at the next corner,
please?

Why? You're not
the police, are you?

No.

No. No.

Are you?

Of course not.

Ho ho.

That's a view.

â™ªâ™ª [dance rhythm]

So?

You do know
I'm working,
right?

What do you mean?

I'm working?

I'm a hustler?

Well, so am I.

[turn off music]
Wait. You can't--
You can't be.

You picked me up.

So? I'm an entrepreneur.

You wouldn't believe
how much money I make

off drunk frat boys
with a few bucks
in their back pocket.

Anyway, why
didn't you tell me
that you were working?

'Cause you're
not supposed to.

You're not suppo--
 Why didn't you 
say something?

Oh, this is ridiculous.

[picks up keys]

Hell!

Would you like
a lift back?


Yeah. Why not?

Don't you boys
look handsome.

You do, too.

Hey, uh,
do you know

what time it is,
Veronica?

It's 10:30.

Oh! I'm gonna--
I'm gonna be late.

I, uh...I--
I-- I got a date
at 11.

You're not staying
for dinner?

You didn't--
You didn't say
nothing.

I've got a date.
French dude.

Yeah.
See you later.

Come on in, Johnny.

Come on.

Come on.

So, what's
your mom like?

She's from Tennessee.

And what do you like
best about her?

She laughs a lot.

She's fair.

She helps people
with their problems.

She's beautiful.

I always wanted
to have a kid.

Eric's the closest
thing I have.

I would do
anything for him.

His mom and I were
real good friends.

She was a...

very complicated
person,

very independent.

Very...

A lot of people
didn't understand her,

but she had
a great heart.

That sounds like Eric.

Yeah. [laughs]

He takes after her.

Eric talks about you
all the time, Johnny.

He cares for you a lot.

Yeah, I like him.
He's cool. Yeah.

So how long have you been
into racing cars?

Since I was about 12.

I won my first race
when I was ten.


How 'bout you?
What are you into?

Nothing.

Really. Not anymore.

You used to dance,
right?

You're not into that
anymore?

I enjoyed it
for a while, but...

things didn't work out
the way I wanted them to.

That sucks.

I'm starting to have
serious doubts

about whether or not
I'm gonna make it
to Charlotte.

Seems like maybe, uh...

it's not worth
going through all this

just to get there.

I'm gonna keep trying,
though.

I'm not gonna give up.

If I could grant you

one wish
for your birthday...

what would it be?

Um...

Besides getting
to Charlotte, uh...

I would...really

like to give a woman
an orgasm.





Kiss me.

Kiss me.

Kiss me.

There's a lot of ways
to make money
in this city, Johnny.

Working the street's
just one option.

Here's another.
Say you get popped

for some stupid
shit like, uh...
jaywalking.

This county,
they throw your ass

in jail for that shit.

Before you go,
get an Ace bandage.

Wrap it
around your knee.

Get a shitload
of tobacco and
some rolling papers.

You stick it up
underneath there.

Cops never bother
to check it.

Once you're in there,
you sell 'em for
ten bucks a pop.

Easy money.

So you're saying
that you'd go to jail

just to make money?

Gotta do what
you gotta do.

[horn beeps]

I may have to meet
you boys later.

[woman laughs]

Hi.

What happened?

They want
Johnny boy here.

Howdy.

Hi.
What's your name?

Johnny.

You want to go have
a wild sex party?

[girl laughs]

[girl laughs]
Whoo-ooh!

Shit.

â™ªâ™ª [song, 
 strong dance beat]

â™ª Can't you â™ª

â™ª Feel â™ª

â™ª It? â™ª

â™ª Can you feel â™ª

â™ª Can you â™ª

â™ª Feel â™ª

Can I bum
a cigarette?

â™ªâ™ª [loud dance beat]

Can I bum a cig?


are you doing?

whoa, whoa, whoa.

Brentley. Hey.
How's your family?

Yo, dude.

Just want you to pay
my brother's money

so the cops
don't know your shit.

I was real busy
today.

I didn't have time
to call. All right?

Look.
It's not all right.

You got to pay him
right now.

My brother
wants his money.

Look,
I have the money.
I swear.

I'll get it
to you tomorrow.
All right?

Dude, if you don't
have my brother's money,

there ain't no telling
what's gonna happen
to you.

All right.

â™ªâ™ª [tempo change]

How's it going?

You wanna
get outta here?

Sure. Yeah.

Yeah? Let's go.
Let's go.

This DJ sucks.

[second guy]
Oh, man!

So you were
over there?

We're rolling.
Who's with me?

â™ªâ™ª [dance pop]

[chatter, shouting]

Yeah, daddy's home!

[laughter, chatter]


So what'd you do
with those girls?

The question is not
what did we do.

It's what
didn't we do.

Check it.

260 bucks.

20 bucks tip.

Enough for a bus ticket,
definitely.

Definitely.

Problem is
doesn't account

for the, uh,
hospitality
you've shown me

for putting me up,
for feeding me
and everything.

I gotta make
a little more money

before I can bail
with a clear conscience.

Nah. You don't
owe me nothing.

You helped me out
a lot.

Nobody else would've
done that for me.

Best friend
I ever had.

You wanna go get
something to drink?

No. I'm fine.

I'm just gonna
hang here.

I'll be back.

So, dude,
this fucking staircase
by the new hotel.

Shit. You should've
been there.

My girl don't even
let me out anymore.

Well, hi. You look
a lot better.

Since the last time
I saw you.

You found me after
I got my ass kicked.
Right?

Mm-hmm.
Oh, I forgot
about that.

Well, it's a good thing
Mel and I came along
when we did

'cause you know
that guy?

He was gonna
piss on your head.

Pi-Piss on my head.

Yeah. But
his girlfriend
stopped him.

You know,
it was weird.
He just

put his wiener
back in his pants
and walked away.

You saved my life.

How can I
ever repay you?

See a movie with me
tomorrow night.

Movies
are kinda lame.

Oh, I know.

Well, let's go
to the Arcade, then.

Okay.

Are we gonna
have fun?

Uh-huh.
Of course.

â™ªâ™ª [bouncy pop]

Johnny, how you living?

Uh, styling
and profiling.

Mm-hmm.


I didn't know you liked
so many different kinds
of music.

I don't. I just
jack 'em anyways.

No...way!

No fucking way!

What?

I can't believe
you have this.

This is the most
fucked-up CD
in the world.

My dad
listens to this.
What is it?

It's a surprise.

All right?
I'm-a put it on.

I don't like
surprises.

Now, you're
gonna love this.
You're gonna love it.

Yo, what's up?
What's that?

â™ªâ™ª [percussion intro ]

Whoo!
 â™ªâ™ª [rock 'n' roll]

Oh, no. Yo, hurry.
Turn this shit off.
Yo?

Come with me.

â™ªâ™ª [Rockabilly Roadhouse]

Whoo!

Oh, cowboy.

Yo, I cannot have
this permitted
in my house.

â™ª Rockabilly Roadhouse â™ª


All right.
Come on.

No fucking way.
Why not?

That's the most
uncool shit

I have ever seen
in my life.
Eric, come on!

Come on.

[chatter, laughter]
Eric.

Stay there. Okay?
Step out. Here we go.

Go back one.

And back.

[chatter, laughter]

Backwards. Toe down.


Come on. Steven, get in.
Fuck it.

Yee-haw!

He's looking good.

[chatter, laughter]

[hollering, applause]

â™ª On Rockabilly Road â™ª

â™ª And at the Rockabilly â™ª

â™ª Roadhouse â™ª

Whoo! 
 â™ª Roadhouse â™ª

[door opens]

What are you
doing here?

Johnny. Been
looking for you.

Set something up
for us tonight.

How long you
been living here?

Place is a bit small,
don't you think?

Uh...no. Thanks.

Yeah, it is...
a little. I mean,

it-- it's okay
for now.

Uh, we're gonna--
we're gonna get

a new place real soon.
You know. Me and Eric.

I'm getting
outta this town.

Shit's fucking
played out.

I'd leave tonight
if I could.

Just waiting for
the right opportunity.

Weren't you trying
to get somewhere
originally,

like, uh, New York
of something?

North Carolina, yeah.
I'm still gonna go.

I'm still going.
Just gotta
stick around here,

make a little
more money first.

How long's
that gonna take?

A week? A month?

Johnny, you got the skills
to make this shit
happen right now.

You just need
someone like me

to point you
in the right direction.

What do you mean?

I am talking about
cold, hard cash.

I know a lot of people
in this town

that would
pay big money
for guys like us.

We're a rare
commodity.

Y-You're talking
about guys,
though, right?

Does it really matter?
I mean, come on.

Last time
I checked, the money
was still great.

I don't know
about that.

Guys pay more.

Simple fact
of life, Johnny.

You can make more
in one night

than you would
in an entire week.

You could be
in North Carolina
this weekend.

Well, what would
I have to do?

Hang out.
Be cordial.

Cordial.

Yeah. You know,
just be yourself.

You can do that.
Right?

Yeah.

Yeah.


Right. Let's go
have some fun,

make some money.
Come on.

I can't go
right now, though.

Why not? I already
set it up.

I told 'em you
were into fast cars,

fast women.
They loved it. 
Let's go.

I gotta wait
for Eric.

He's gonna be
back here
any second.

You know, you
should lose that guy.

Seriously.
He's going nowhere.

He'll bring you
down eventually.

So, you coming
or what?

I'm gonna leave
a note.

No. No, no,
Johnny.

If you're going,
we gotta go
right now.

All right.

Is this gonna be,
like, a party, then?

Like,
lots of people?

Is there
gonna be beer?

Um, possibly.

I hope so, man.
That'd be cool.

Eric.

What's up?
What are you
doing out here?

What's the matter?

Today's
my birthday.

Uh, Happy Birthday.

Hey, I'm legal now.

I can go to County.

Yeah. Next time I get
jacked is the last time
I get jacked.

Johnny, we do not
have time to fuck
around here.

All right?
These guys are not
gonna wait for us.

So let's go.
Celebrate later.
Come on.

I'm staying.
It's his birthday.

This is work, Johnny!

I don't c--
I'm staying.

Look, they're
not gonna pay

unless there's
the two of us.
All right?

I don't care.
I'm not going.

I need
this fucking money!

All right?

Fucking losers.

A big date, huh?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. Steven's tricks

always pay
the big bucks.

You shoulda gone.

What do you mean?

You coulda scored.

That's all.

You don't
want to hang out
on your birthday?

Nah, that's okay.
I'm gonna...

I'm gonna go to bed.

Hold up.

What the fuck
is your problem?

Give it back.
No.

Give my coin back.

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Give it
back to me!

Fuck you!

Give my fucking
coin back!
No!

No!
Fuck you!

What the hell's
your problem?

Why are you fucking
acting like this?

'Cause it's my birthday!

'Cause I--
I love someone

who will never understand
how much I care about him.


What are you
talking about?

Look, I do care
about you, okay?
I fucking--

Why do you think
I stuck around?

You need
to make money.

No, 'cause--

You're the best friend
I've ever had
in my life, Eric.

I have never had
a friend like you before.

I stuck around
because I care for you,

and I can't fucking stand
to see you be here

by yourself!
This place sucks!

All right?
Just--

You deserve to be
someplace better.

You know, when I get
to North Carolina,

I'll be making
a lot of money.

And I want you
to come with me.

Okay? I want you
 to come live with me,

and I want you
to be my roommate
in Charlotte, all right?

You-- You know...

Why can't you just act
like a normal person

and reject me?


All right?

But I'm serious.
Let's fucking get
the hell outta here.

Tomorrow. Let's go.

I can't.
Why?

We don't have
enough money.

We can hitch a ride!

No. I can't leave
Veronica.

She'll understand.

You can call her.
I'll buy you
a phone card.

Come on.

All right.

I'm not gonna leave
till you give
my silver dollar back.

Okay.


Where'd you
get that, anyway?

My mom
gave it to me.


It's all I got
to remind me of her.

Brings me good luck.

Come on.

â™ªâ™ª [slow pop]

Ohh!

Shit!


Happy Birthday.

Make a wish.

I just want to tell you.
I had the bomb time
tonight.

I mean, you're,
like, perfect for me.

Thanks.

All I could think
about, all night,

is how much
I want to kiss you.

Ohh...

Well, can I?

C-Can I kiss you?

All right.


Where's
Eric and Johnny?

Oh, you're back.
I-- I haven't seen 'em.

Yo, what about Steven?
You seen him?
Uh-uh.

Yo, well, tell those guys
I'm looking for 'em.

They got my shit,
and I need it back.

You understand?
You understand?

Jeez.

[breathes shakily]

[crickets chirping]


[door opens,
hinges creak]

Whassup?

Hey, all you got
is lowfat, homeys?

What's up
with that shit?

Why'd you
bust the door?

Shit, I didn't

do that.
It was like that

when I got here.

Looks like you fools
had a break-in.

I'm hungry
as a motherfucker,
man.

You know, this cereal
chow me some chill shit.

I haven't eaten
for days.

Well, you know,
I just came by
to get my supply.

Where you been?

Shit.
After I ditched

those punk-ass
bike cops, man,

I had to kick it
on a deal for a bit.

Yeah, I was sticking
at my home boy Fav's
for a few days

till they fucking
pop my ass, man.

You know, his girlfriend's
a bitch-ass little
fucking whore bitch.

And she called
the cops, man,
straight up.

I've been in County
this whole
fucking time, man.

Got released last night
and hitched a ride here.


What happened
to your face?

Shit, I'd like to say
is I was eating pussy,

but I'd be lying. But
I ran into these bustas

I do business
with and shit.

Yeah, but I kicked
their asses.

Yeah, so I need
my shits now, homey.

I got a lot of business
in the next couple days.

You know
what I'm saying?
I got it.

Cool.


[rattling through drawer]

[closes drawer]

Yo, it's my life, blood,
but I wasn't worried

'cause I know
you're my homeys.

You guys got my back
for sure. Right?

Johnny.

Yeah. One second.

I owe these bustas, man.
If I don't deliver,

they're gonna bust a cap
in my fucking dome

piece, man.
No lie, man.

[cabinet door
opening]

So what the fuck, homes?

I can't find it.

Hey, don't fucking
tell me that shit.

Fuck, no.

Find my shit.

Steven.

Steven.

It must've been.

I mean, don't fucking
tell me that shit!

He was here
the other day!

He must've taken it
or something.

You fucking-ass
fuckers!

What the fuck?
You think
I'm stupid?!

Huh? What the fuck
should I believe
that shit for?!

Why would he fuck me over
if I don't fuck him over
first?

He said he was
bailing any day.

He didn't care
how he did it.

That's not
my motherfucking
problem!

You're supposed to
watch my back!

And you think you can
fuck me over, I'm supposed
to just chill?

I don't
fucking think so!

Well, fuckers...

[breathing heavily]
Fuck.

Fuck that.

Don't get in my
fucking way, bitch!

Where the fuck you score
this shit at, huh?

Huh?


What's the fuck
with these shit?

What the fuck--
What about these shit?

If it's Steven,
it has to be around
here someplace.

We'll get it back!

Y'all fucking
better get it back,
believe me!

Look, let's go
right now.
We'll go right now.

Sit the fuck down, home!

You ain't going
fucking nowhere!

All right,
here's the shit!

You go find that fucker
and get my shit!

And you fucking
better get it!
You understand me?

Okay. Okay.

And if you don't,

I'm gonna flip
your fucking cap!

And then yours!

Get the fuck--
fuck outta here,
bitch!

Fuck you looking at,
white boy?

â™ªâ™ª [dance]

[laughter, chatter]

I need the shit
you jacked right now.

What are you
babbling about?

Look, it's my fault
what happened
the other night,

but J.T.
needs it back now.

It's not
my problem.

He's gonna kill Johnny
if he doesn't get it
back tonight.

Yeah, well,
I'm sorry about that,

but it's not like
the guy didn't deserve it.

You guys fucked up.

Yeah?

expect me to do?

I put my life
on the line every day.

I know you do, Larry.

So you can live here
rent-free.

No. Uh, Larry,
I've been--
I've been helping,

too. I've
been washing--
Helping?

Hush, Larry.
 Helping how?

I come home
after a long day,

and I find you here
unconscious.

You're like
a fucking junkie.

Larry, I haven't
taken any of that shit
for so long.

I mean...
Yeah, yeah.

I've heard
this before.

Eric.

Hey.

What are you doing?

I, uh ...

You--
You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Oh, I am so sorry.

Happy Birthday.

I'm sorry. I am.


What's wrong?
Bad day?

Uh, I-- I told Johnny
how I really feel,

and...and I was

just wrong
the whole time.

He-- He really-- really
does care about me.

I ha-- I had
the best time tonight.

I've really had
a lot of fun.

I'm gonna get you
a cake tomorrow.

I got-- I--
I gotta go.

You always
get so emotional
on your birthday.

You all right?

Yeah.

Um...

I love you a lot.

I love you, too.


Good-bye.

â™ªâ™ª [rap] 


Hold on. Hold on.
All right?

All right, hold on.
Here's another one

I heard inside.
All right?

All right.
What's the difference

between a slut
and a bitch?

â™ªâ™ª [rap continues]

Come on, man, what?

All right, man.

A slut fucks everyone,

and a bitch fucks
everyone but you.


Man, you got
no sense of humor,
homey.


Here, homes.
Put that on your dome.

Hey, put it
on your head.


All right.
All right, don't--

All right,
don't move.
Don't move.

so fucking stupid.

Don't-- Don't move,
man. I swear to God,
you look so stupid.


â™ªâ™ª [rap continues]

[hinges creaking]

Shit! Ohh!

[glass shattering]
Aah!

[shouts, gunshots]

Johnny!

Johnny!

I'm here.

You're hurt!

No, I'm fine.
I'm okay.

[breathing heavily]

It was fucking soup.

It was--
It was tomato soup.

He put the can
on my head
and shot it off.

[breathing heavily]
We gotta go.

Let's go.
All right.


Come on!

[breathing heavily]
Wait. Hold up.

What?
Where we going?

I don't know.

Come on.
Come on!

Come on!

Start exercising.
Come on!

Wait. Wait. Sit.
What? What?

Wait.

No. Shit. No.

Wait.

It's so--
so cold for July.

Oh, shit.

I'm freezing.

[breathing heavily]


[coughs, gags]


[breathing irregularly]

Mmhh...

Johnny.

A lot...
A lot of people--

[breathes
with difficulty]

don't know what it's like

to care for someone.

But...

I'm happy I got
to care for you.

You're a special person.

You're a special
person to me.

You're just what
I always wanted.

What I always hoped.

I mean, I didn't think
it was gonna be
like how it was.

But it was perfect.

It was perfect
for me, Johnny.

I mean, I've
loved you a lot.

I've loved you
a whole lot.

And I know
you care for me, too.

Eric, it's
gonna be okay.

All right?
It's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna go
get some help.
All right?

Uhh. No, no, no, no.
Don't-- Don't leave.

Just...Just...
Just stay here.

Keep me warm.

[sniffles, weeps]

Pocket.

My...pocket.

For good luck.

[exhales slowly]

Eric.

Eric. Eric!

No. Come on.

Come on. Come on!

Eric, No!
I need you!
Come on!


[siren blip,
police radio]

Shit.

[police radio
chatter]

[dazed sound effect]

[baby cries]

[P.A. announcement] 
 The final call 
 for Red Line bus

number 23 to Phoenix. 
 All departing passengers

should proceed 
 to Gate 10 immediately.

[turnstile turns]

I know!
I know.

This is the gate change 
 announcement

for Gray Line bus number 
 23 to Salt Lake City.

Bus 23 will now depart 
 from Gate 11.

Gate 11.

Bus number 48 
 now ready for boarding

at Gate number 7. 
 All passengers

proceed to Gate 7...


[slot machine
clicking]


[baby cries]

Excuse me.

[bus pulls away]

Hmm.

[coins falling]

I need
a destination, sir.

You can't leave
without a destination.

[bus door closing]

 And they're heading 
 down the final stretch!

And it's Yellowtail 
 by a length,

followed by Mickey Finn!

Mickey Finn is making 
 his move on the outside!

Go, go! Go!

Come on, come on!

And it's Yellowtail 
 by a nose!

Damn!
No!

Would you boys
like another drink?

I'll have another beer,
darling.

Me, too.

Be right with you.

Well, hi, everybody, 
 and welcome back

to the Charlotte 
 Motor Speedway

and more racing action.

The weather's perfect. 
 It's a beautiful day.

And, Chuck, 
 I got to tell you,

the Petty Team's been 
 putting on the pressure

all day today.

Well, you're not kidding 
 about that, Bob.

You know, coming off 
 at 11th place

finishing in Talladega 
 last week,

they hunkered down 
 and grabbed the number 2 spot

at qualifying.

After ending 
 only 5/8 of a second

behind the leaders,

they've dominated 
 today's race.

Harley Hebert 
 is not a happy camper

and knows he's 
 got to make it up

on his next pit stop.

And, with less 
 than ten laps to go,

that should happen 
 real soon.

The 43 car has just 
 pulled into the pit,

and pro chief Jerry Powell 
 looking worried.

Oh, you bet he is, 
 partner.

With 3/8 of a second 
 to gain,

this has got to be 
 picture perfect.

Harley Hebert's crew chief

has just signaled his driver 
 into the pit,

and w-- 
 Wait-- Wait a second.

Looks like we got a tire 
 rolling into pit row.

That's 
 exactly what it is,

and one of the crew 
 is running over

to deal with it 
 right now.

I wish I could 
 see the expression

on Jerry Powell's face.

That boy earned his 
 six-pack for the day.

That was a seriously 
 close call.

Didn't hurt 
 their time much.

Well, Hebert's team 
 did lose

a little time 
 at the pit...

Great job, Johnny!
The race isn't over!

â™ª Guess I've always known â™ª

â™ª That I'm a cruiser â™ª

â™ª Naked and alone â™ª

â™ª The self-abuser â™ª

â™ª Just didn't fit â™ª

â™ª Just couldn't quit â™ª

â™ª Everything I've done â™ª

â™ª Turns into shit â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm full of nothing â™ª

â™ª Big little nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm full of nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª Start out of nothing â™ª

â™ª Tearing down the wife â™ª

â™ª I'd never follow â™ª

â™ª Taking all at once â™ª

â™ª Is hard to swallow â™ª

â™ª One at a time

â™ª Feeling behind â™ª

â™ª Do what I have to â™ª

â™ª Just said good-bye â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm less than nothing â™ª

â™ª I'm full of nothing â™ª

â™ª Big little nothing â™ª
