Bolivian!

Loser!

Atacama Desert, CHILE AUGUST 5, 2010

Day 1

I found this on level 3.

So?

We put these mirrors in the cracks so we know if the mountain shifts.

She's an old mine.

The mountain is going to shift.

The mirrors are going to break.

I think we should get a health check on the ramp. We maybe look at...

The ramp is a good rock. - We may

The mine's got another 20 years left in there.

We maybe looking

at the weakness at the mountains's internal structure.

Marco, is my job to keep these men safe.

Correction.

Your job, Lucho ...

is to keep these men pulling out 250 tons a day.

250?

Your quote has gone up.

There's only so much gold in the mountain.

Dario.

All right, guys, We're going rock bottom today.

Where is Carlos Mamani?

Here.

Everyone!

Say hello to Mamani our new boy from Bolivia.

He's a tin digger.

What does a tin digger from Bolivia know about mining for gold?

Elvis, not today, uh?.

I got this.

Your retirement papers, Gomez!

Two weeks and you're a free man!

Sign them and get them back to me ah?

Bravo, Gomez!

Lobos, go!

Is that the only way in?

The only way in and the only way out.

I know Elvis didn't write his own lyrics, right?

That's blasphemy.

After you will tell me that he didn't not do his own dancing.

How much longer?

About an hour.

Quiet, Lobos.

Ok,huevones. You know what to do.

WORKSHOP 520 meters underground - 32oC

Getting together. Dario!

Yonni, what is that?  Aggh!

Bolivia! Hey, Bolivia!

Kananni, Kachani ... What's your name?

Mamani.

Whatever, come over here.

I know, I know. That's crazy, Elvis.

SHELTER 700 meters underground - 34 oC

Always looking for trouble.

Actually he thinks he's Elvis.

Rodrigo's offer me a job in his body shop.

50 a week. How you thinks about that?

Â¿50 a week? That's a joke, right?

And you're gonna be a father?

That's the problem.

You know what?

You're asking the wrong man.

And I have a terrible hangover.

I do not know, it's the same thing over and over with my dad.

What was that?

Thi's why we are here.

Yes, I can, can taste it.

Copper and gold. 1.200 an ounce.

Take it.

Take it.

Cholo, are you gonna stick it in your pocket for your momma?

What you say?

Everyone knows that Bolivians are a bunch of thieves.

It's stupid, you know that?

Chile stole this land.

After the war of 1881.

Who are the thieves?

... That was in 1881, you know?

Run now! Run!

What the hell?

Dario! -- Ah, Aaahhh!

Alex, pull me out!

Pull me out!

Do not let me fall!

Do not let me fall! - Hold on, Dario!

Pull me out!

Wrong way!

Come to the refuge! Get down!

Jonny!

Turn around!

Take care!

Stop! Stop!

No, no!

Go! Go! Go!

GÃ³mez.

Gomez!

Alex!

Alex!

You all right?

Come here.

Quick!

Stay with him.

You okay, Gomez? - Yeah.

Let's get you up.

Where is the pastor?

Henriquez.

Pull!

Elvis.

You okay man?

Boys.

You have to see this.

That's so big rock.

That's not a rock.

That's the heart of the mountain.

She finally broke.

Yes sir, yes



I got my people checking her now, yes

We'll keep it contained.

I'll make sure no one leaves.

GO, go, let's go!

Let's go!

Hey, Jose, there's been a collapse in the mine.

They're locking us down.

I'm calling the news.

Nobody can leave!

Wait, Don Jose!

Stay here. I'll call you later.

No! I'm coming with you. No!

Hello?

What?

A serious accident just occurred in San JosÃ© mine ...

40 minutes outside Copiapo.

The number of miners trapped inside has yet to be determined ...

but the company estimates that 30 men were working below.

29 ...

30 ...

31, 32 ...

33.

We are all here.

I thank God for that.

The refuge is built for 30, so.

So we're OK.

Wha, wha, what you mean?

What you mean we're OK?

The ramp is blocked, Mario.

There is no road. We have no way out.

What about the chimneys?

There is ladders there.

Too dangerous.

I am not ready to sit down there in the refuge and wait for help.

Mario!

My job is simple.

I have a duty to the safety of these men.

At this moment, the refuge is the safest place, ah!.

There's a radio.

There's food.

Some of these guys need patching up.

You know me, Lucho.

There is no way out until there is no way out.

And I gonna check out those ladders.

Don Luis. Excuse me.

Coming with you.

All right, come on. Bolivian!

We should make a lot of... noise.

Burn tires, bang up pipes.

Make a big racket, you never know.

What are they doing?

We have to wait.

It's okay.

Hey! Talk to us!

Five hours we've been here!

We told you already.

The company has the situation under control.

Come on, huevÃ³n!

Do something!

OK, everybody shut up!

Or I'll have you removed!

Now, go home and wait to be contacted!

Who threw that?

I did.

What are you going to do? Shoot me?

Get off the property!

And you too!

All of you!

Get out of here!

Go home!

Come on!

Eh, where are you all going? Go back.

No, please, stay, we have to stand our ground, we have to stay put, come on.




What do you want us to do Maria?

They have not told us anything!

That's cause they're hiding something.

And there is a reason for that!

No, we have to stand our ground. We Have to stay put.

Whe're the rescue teams - Uh?

Whe're your rescue teams?

Whe're your drills?

Why isn't anybody doing anything?

My brother is down there!

We're not going anywhere!

We have to stay here!

She's right!

We want to stay!

Put that down! put that down!

Get used to it!

Stop it!

We're not going anywhere!

La Moneda Presidential Palace - Santiago de Chile

This is a private mine?

Yes sir.

Bohn and Kemeny. Chilean nationals.

33 men trapped underground.

And we don't even know if they're alive?

The responsibility bears in Bohn and Kemeny.

The government has no obligation to take a position.

We should have no position on this.

What are they doing about it? - Nothing.

They don't have the capability.

I think the government should show its face.

I'd like to go up there and take a look at it, Sir.

You've never set foot in a mine, Laurence.

What makes you think you can make any difference?

You've been in the job for what? 4 months!.

If we do not react ...

if we bury our heads, it will look like we don't care.

That's bad for the industry and that's bad for Chile.

With all due respect, Sir, is not about us.

I believe we have a moral responsibility.

33 lives is a lot of dead people.

Go ahead!

Stop!

Come on, Alex.

Someone has to hear.

Lobos...

You're wasting your time.

Nobody is gonna hear us.

Nobody is gonna help us.

Hello, this is Luis Urzua.

I'll check first aid.

Hello, this is Luis Urzua. Can you hear me?

Hello, this is Luis Urzua. Can you hear me?

Fuck.

What?

There is no more ladder.

What do you mean no more ladder?

I'm telling you, it's not here.

No no.

No no.

Moving on.

Alex ...

Let's go back.

Okay.

Okay.

Dammit.

No, No!

Alex!

Mario! - Hold on!

Our Father, who art in heaven ... WHO

Lord Jesus Christ ...

you who are the son of our creator ...

we ask you to grant us strength and fortitude ...

in our tribulation.

We ask you today ...

to protect our families.

DAY 2

The government. Hurry up.

Can you please let me through?

We want answers.

That's why I'm here, madam.

But I can't give you answers unless you let me in.

Or I'll can have them remove you.

Go ahead and try it.

If you want a little riot on TV tonight.

You from the government, right? - Laurence Golborne.

Minister of Mining.

There are a lot of unhappy people up here, Laurence.

It's been two days and no one has told us anything!

We all know how this works.

The government shows up ...

Some good looking guy in a suit tells us how much they care.

How much are they going to stop at nothing to save them and do nothing!

We are not going to stand for it, Laurence!

I want you to promise me you do something.

I can promise we are going to do everything we can.

Okay?

Ok, go ahead.

Move, move, let them through. - Thank you.

We want answers!

We want answers!

We want answers!

Let's say they are alive.

How long do they have?

Assuming ...

they are alive and they make it to the refuge ...

There is enough food and water for three days.

And what attempts have been made to reach them?

I sent a crew of my men down.

Couple of them were almost killed.

So, what can we do next, Mr. Castillo?

Nothing.

Well, what is the protocol, then?

Protocol?

This mountain is still moving.

I've been a miner for 25 years.

I've seen five collapses.

You know how many men we've saved?

No one!

Minister, can you tell us anything?

Yes.

The government is assessing the situation.

Are they alive, do you know?

What did they tell you?

The mine is extremely unstable.

And dangerous for rescuers.

Therefore ...

We have to suspend any further rescue attempts for the moment.

You promised!

Grab the minister!

Get inside!

Close the gates!

Is not right!

We are leaving!

This way, sir.

You promised!

Please, it's my father! - My husband is down!

Get backwards!

Help us!

Lunch time.

I think we should wait for everyone.

Why?

I'm hungry. - Dario.

This food is for an emergency.

What is this, Yonni? A picnic?

Take it easy.

Come on, I am going to eat, Yonni, come on.

Dario - I want you to move - Come on, Yonni - Use your head - Dario, Dario!!

Move!



Look at this crap.

Works for me.

You knew, didn't you?

You knew they never finished the ladders.

You knew that place was a death trap ...

but you let us come down, Lucho.

Listen ...

I asked Castillo about the ladders.

I asked him again and again.

He had the certification!

Don Lucho!

What's going on there?

Don Lucho!

Give it back to me!

Don Lucho! Look at this!

Give me the key.

Give me the key!

Son of a bitch!

What you doing, Dario?

Having lunch. - Oh, having lunch?

You're having lunch?

It is my food.

Calm down! Enough!

Aug!

Stop it! Stop it!

Calm down! Calm down!

So some cookies. What's the big deal?

What's the big deal?

Let me tell you.

There is no ladders to climb.

And the chimneys just gave in.

And there is a huge rock blocking our only way out of here.

Guys.

We are buried alive.

That's the big deal.

This is all the food we have left to keep us alive!

We have to ration it carefully!

If we plan on survive down here until we are rescued!

Rescue us?

Do you hear any drills?

That's because there's no drilling for us.

We too far down.

It took one hundred years for the to dig this deep.

How long do you think it's gonna take?

Do you think the owners are gonna to spend that kind of money?

They didn't even finished the ladders!

They'll wait three days.

Then close the mine and put up the gravestones.

No.

No, no, no, no!

I don't believe that!

They'll dig us out!

And If they don't, our families will!

With their bare hands, IF IS NECESSARY!

I believe we'll make out of here because, because I choose to believe!

All 33 of us!

Now, you, Lucho, you believe whatever you want.

Is your problem.

Yep.

Yep. That's the way.

With that rescue better be pretty quick.

Yeah. Give me.

There's 18 cans of tuna.

165 grams per can.

33 men ...

is 90 grams per man.

as half a can.

A little more for the rest of your lives.

Anybody else?

Thank you.

Come on.

Eh! Thank you.

Mario. - Give me.

Earlier today ...

The mining Company rescue teams made an attempt to enter the mine.

Through the ventilation chimneys.

But a secondary collapse blocked off any possible access to it.

The mining company has now relinquished control.

Are you watching this?

The Chilean government is taking over this operation.

Of course.

I need you up there, Sougarret. As soon as possible.

Golborne's going to need help.

And everyone I speak to says you're the best in the business.

Thank you Mr. President. I appreciate it.

And you appreciate that...

we cannot afford to fall on our asses in front of the whole country.

Which one of you is Laurence Golborne?

Can I help you?

Sougarret. Andre Sougarret.

I'm your new chief engineer.

Says who?

The President.

Now, assuming they're alive ...

we got 33 men down there.

They are running out of food and water.

But there is adequate air.

We know they can survive for a period of time ...

if they are relatively healthy ...

but we don't know that.

Some of them could be injured ...

some of them are in the early or late stages of silicosis.

Miner's lung disease.

What I do know is that if we don't get them out fast ...

we will gonna be bringing up 33 corpses.

Here's what we know:

the men were working in the lower half of the mine when it collapsed.

That puts them here, at the refuge.

A five meters wide space...

200 stories down.

My readings indicate ...

that a massive rock displaced itself here.

We are talking about 700,000 tons of diorite.

Or twice the mass ...

of the Empire State Building.

Obviously...

we can't go in through the ah.. front door, so to speak.

So, we gonna have to drill.

Best case scenario...

we reach them in eight days.

Eight days?

They're too far down, too deep.

Eight days?

But that's not the biggest problem.

It's the deviation factor.

Look. Here is the refuge.

If we run these drills 24 hours a day...

at full speed...

the drill is going to deviate like this...

or like this.

In fact it can bend 20 different ways.

And even if everything is going according to plan...

The odds are still against us.

So, what exactly are you saying?

What I'm saying, Minister...

is that there is less than 1% chance of finding them.

I need every drill you can get your hands on.

And I want them here as soon as possible.

DAY 3

Mario. - Yes.

This one has less.

Which one?

This.

Are very happy? - Yeah.

Al right, ladies.

Next meal in 24 hours.

How is supposed we survive on this?

We get hungry, we can always eat the Bolivian.

I've heard Bolivians taste like chicken.

The drills are here!

We did it!

Good.

You twist it.

and you twists all those wires together.

There will be light.

You can not live without light.

Tell me, Alex.

Why do you think, ah, having a boy is so much better than having a girl?

Yonni, what is it about that girls like you?

Face like horse's ass...

nappy hair, bad breath...

you fart in your asleep.

How come that ladies love you so much??

There 's 33 guys down  here and I'm the only one ...

who has a little something going on the side.

No, not in the house across the street, man!

At least, close the curtains!.

She doesn't has curtains.

Elvis is in the building.

Do you hear that?

It's a drill.

They're looking for us.

Is that not the sweetest sound you've ever heard?

Day 5

It is much more complicated than I ever thought.

I would really want to be there for Ivy's birthday.

Tell the girls I miss them so much.

Stop, stop!

Look, I will call you back.

What happened?

Sougarret! What happened?

Do you see this diorite ? Twice as hard as granite.

This is the problem.

We gonna need new drills.

OK, I can get you more drills, but we're running out of time.

Yeah.

Why are you burning through them so quickly?

Listen, I don't have six months to explain you...

the complex geology of the Atacama Desert, the direction of the drill...

This is not what I asked...

Do you want to be a miner?

Get a book, read the basics.

Start with orogenesis.

I've got 33 men down there I got to worry about.

Why don't you do what you need to do, be a suit, go talk to the media.

Let me do my job.

Why did they taking so much time?

Look. I know you are all growing restless.

I know you want answers.

But I'm here to assure you ...

that we are doing everything we possibly can...

to make contact with your loved ones.

We need to know if they're alive.

I don't have a definitive answer right now.

That's the truth.

We have 10 drills working 24 hours a day.

Look, I know how you must feel.

I'm going to expand accommodations for your families, 

I'm setting up a commisary...

a medical facility...

and a temporary school for your children.

That's all for now.

Minister!

We know the mine is very dangerous.

It can collapse in any moment! Ministre!

Hey, Minister of Mining.

Don't look at me like that.

Not gonna slap you.

I'm not saying 

I'm never gonna slap you...

You kept your word.

What's your name?

Maria Segovia.

Dario's wife

Sister.

He's my kid brother.

I'm not leaving without him.

They're everywhere! Please get them off me!

Get them off me!

They're everywhere!

I need to drink! OMG!

Dario.

I'm dying! I'm dying!

We are all dying. We are going to die.

It's OK.

There's a lot worse things in life than death.

How come, you have time for me?

Why, why don't you hate me like everybody else?

Why? Why?

Hate...

is for children.

If we can all...

be good to each other...

we might find ...

our way out of here.

We can say a prayer together, if you like.

I do not know the words.

God doesn't care.

Merciful Father...

Merciful Father...

Take...

this boy.

Open his eyes...

so he can see.

I am sorry.

I am sorry.

It's OK.

It's OK.

Excuse me.

Maria, where to?

This way please.

OK, we're going to school! Single file, please!

Line in behind me, please.

That one.

Thank you, Susie. - Nice to see you.

Excuse me.

What's your name?

What she's being saying?

What are you doing, Martha? - Her neme is Susana Valenzuela.

Don't do this. - She's my husband's mistress. - Marta!

Sorry Susana, but only family members are permitted inside the fence, so...

No hookers allowed, sorry.

But I am his family.

I love him and I loves me too.

I loves you?

Grab your stuff. - You can throw me out...

but, bitch, when Yonni...

comes up I will welcome up...

who he loves best!

DAY 8

What is this?

Food and water...

You have to make it last.

One tablespoon of tuna every other day ...

and a shot of water once a day.

That's is.

I running through a filter I made.

It sucks, but it's just about drinkable, OK.

Alex.

Do yourself a favor.

If we get out of here...

find yourself a new line of work.

Shut up, Gomez.

Shut up!

Getting close.

Day 12

Adding the last pipe section.

Getting extremely close close, Sir. - Six!

We're down to the last six meters.

Five meters!

Four!

We need to mark it!

Johnny! Get some paint!

When the drill come through...!

we all have to make a lot of noise!

Some note, write a note! - you got it!

What?

What, what, what... Mario?

Is below us.

The thing's below us.

At Least they... are looking in the right place.

Still don't get yet, do you?

It took them this long...

to get that close!

They're not going to look for us forever, Mario.

We're starving, Mario!!

When they get back ...!

We will be dead!

Alex! - Alex!

I've been a miner all my life.

I let you down!

I let myself down.

I knew this place was dangerous!

We all knew about this place!

Nobody is blaming you!

Do you want to blame somebody?

Blame Castillo, blame the owners!

Where is Alex?

Nothing.

It's the deviation, Laurence.

We can't figure it out.

We missed by 10 meters.

A hundred years of piss and shit...

Down there.

Alex!

Really want to do this?, don't do it alone.

You are crazy? - Let's do it together.

Yes IÂ¡m crazy! I am crazy!

I'm completely out of my mind.

But you know what?

I have a daughter.

And a wife.

And you have a wife...

and a baby on the way...

and they're counting on you, Alex.

My baby.

We need you, man.

I need you.

And we've already burned through nine drills.

This is becoming an impossible situation.

Sometimes impossible situations can take a little longer.

Laurence, our guys are already in acute starvation.

If they are even alive.

I thing we've got to start asking ourselves the really though questions.

How long do you think we can keep this on, uh?

DAY 14

What's going on here?

They know the rules, no families allowed. - I know, I know, but I just wish...

It's Don Francisco.

Day 14 in the Atacama Desert and there is no news from the miners buried alive in the San Jose mine.

Ten drills were spread on the dunes of this sector.

Just one is working day and night.

The sound from this drill is the only hope for the mothers and relatives praying for the lives

of the loved ones.

What we ask all around here today: is it too late?
 
Oh, shit! Damn, Mamani!

You made me shit! What, what are you doing here?

The same as you.

What's with the knife?

Are you going to cut me up and eat me?

They say Chileans taste like chicken.

Maybe you've noticed...

I don't have a lot of friends down here.

Where is your head lamp?

I never got one.

Here.
 
Listen, Mamani ...

Nobody is eating anybody while I'm here.

You got that?

I am so scared.

I don't want her growing up without a father.

Tell me it's going to be OK, it's just...

just... - I can't.

Just tell me it's going to be OK.

Jessi, stop it!

You know it as well as I do...

that it's not gonna be OK.

I have wanting to say something.

I am sorry.

I'm very sorry that I stole from you guys.

Just hope one day you can forgive me.

I, I've been saving this for you.

I just wish I had a whole box to give you.

Thank you, Dario.

Thank you from all of us.

What I wouldn't do for...

one of your sister's empanadas right now.

Bless this food. Amen.

Oh Lord.

My life.

Katty.

It's gonna be OK.

Mom, what are you doing here?

Look how skinny you are, Yonni.

Eat!.

CharquicÃ¡n.

Your favorite.

Excuse me.

Fresh milk.

Anyone?

I just...

I just want you to know ...

that I...

couldn't be prouder...

to share with you...

this Last meal,

with all of you.

If that's it...

this is our last supper...

I am officially handing my retirement papers.

I quit!

You called it off.

It wasn't my decision.

And this?

A memorial?

A poem for the gravestones, a few words by Pablo Neruda.

I has nothing to do with me.

This is bullshit. Look.

Those people out there are counting on us.

You and me.

33 men underground.

300 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters...

and we are their only hope.

It's not about it, Laurence. It's a false hope.

And you're giving up! - Three days food?

That's all they had.

They're down there for 16 days.

You're giving these families false hope - Look.

They can survive 40 days without food. - Not under those conditions, Laurence.

It's 100 F down there. Do you know what is like?

It's a tomb!

I understand how you feel. I feel the same.

I know that your heart is in the right place.

And what is yours?

It's not about you!

It's over!

It's over, Laurence.

I have something for you.

Hi.

The best empanada in town.

I mean well.

I do.

I say what I think.

That's my trouble.

I want to please.

Somehow, I...

I always find a way to miss.

Not by miles, but.

I can't seem to learn from my mistakes.

You have to sleep, you.

Thank you.

We Heard the news, Minister. I'm sorry.

Do not be. No one has died yet.

Restart the drill.

You've got it. You have the azimuth?

Uh?

The azimuth. The angle, Minister.

Hey, Laurence.

You need some help?

What's on your mind?

Ground.

Refuge.

Drill.

Look at the direction.

Look how I drew it.

Yes, but I don't get your point.

So we learn from our mistakes.

Let the toughness of the rock be our guide.

Your drill is facing in the wrong direction.

Exactly.

This doesn't make any sense.

Only if you aim to...

Miss.

You're crazy?

You'll bring the mountain down on top of these men.

Stop trying to think like you're some kind of...

Yes! We use the deviation of measurements from our last miss.

and we already know where the rock is at his most dense.

So simple!.

Learn from your mistakes.

Aim to miss.

Now you think it like a miner.

DAY 17

If I have a girl...

I'm gonna call her Esperanza (Hope).

Jessi would like that.

Comfort, pastor.

Drink.

Stay with me, pastor.

Our Father, who art in heaven...

hallowed be thy name.

Let your kingdom come.

Forgive me, Lord.

Give us this day our daily bread...

and forgive us our trespasses...

as we forgive...

Those who trespass against us.

Do not let us be tempted...

and deliver us from evil.

Amen.

Drill.

Drill!

Drill!

Hey!

A drill!

It's here!

It's here!

Look, look! Look!

Look! Hey, guys!

We are here!

Shhhh! I hear something.

Someone is alive.

Shut down the generators!

Could be rock fall.

Stethoscope.

Here.

Get the note!

Get the note!

Stop!

It's been painted.

Are you sure it was not there before? - Definitely not, Sir.

There's something there.

Where?

Oh my God!

This message comes to us from the depths...

of the earth.

From the very hands of our miners.

"We are all well in the refuge.

The 33".

Viva Chile, mierda!

Thank you! ahhh, thank you!

Susi! Marta!

Its alive!

They are safe!

They are all safe!

I knew you could do it.

We found them, now we have to get them out.

Nobody has ever done anything like this before.

Chi... Leee! Chi...Chi...Chi... le! le! le!

Chilean miners!


God bless our miners!

God bless them!

Is Luis Urzua, the supervisor.

Can you hear me?

Yes, I can hear you.



This is Laurence Golborne, the Minister of mining.

How are you?

17 days is a long time.

And after 17 days, you would not blame rescuers for losing hope...

Until they got the sign that is that 33 miners, all of them ...

2000 feet down...

were OK.

On this very moment, food and medicines, and the food is actually NASA-designed, liquid food...  

as the miner's conditions do not allow them digesting solid food, yet...
are being sent down to the mine trough a 14 cm diameter pipe.

The families today get a chance to do what they do once a week.

 They get to meet via a videoconference with their loved ones below...

for about 8 minutes.

Three platforms are now in place specialized in deep drilling.

The Australian drill, Plan A ...

is going directly into the miner's  emergency shelter...

Which is 2300 feet below the surface.

Plan C is this system for oil drilling, provided by Canadians.

It allows drilling a tube big enough for a man getting into.

Down here is Plan B.

Now, this is a T-130 drill. - OK

That is gonna be manned by the US engineer ...

Jeff Hart.

It is a pretty blunt instrument.

It's like a huge jackhammer.

But it could get through the ground very quickly.

One guy is a drug problem...

another suffers from depression, another guy is bipolar.

These men are going to start killing each other...

If they're down for much longer.

And this is going to go on for 3 months ...

at least.

Three months?

Are you recording? - ahhh...

DAY 20

My name is Mario Sepulveda.

Welcome to the...

San Jose mine resort Hilton.

We'll take a look around.

Guys, more pigeons coming in!

Nikes!

And iPods for everyone!

Hey, Gomez! Here are your dirty magazines.

Mario? - Hi dad, hi.

Can you hear us? - Can you hear us, dad?

Yes Yes.

How are you? Other than skinny.

Katty.

You're so skinny.

Scarlett.

It's okay, dad.

Today was hard day for the rescuers of the San Jose mine.

After drilling far down, the Australian drill, Plan A ...

suffered a serious setback. When drilling, a hydraulic pipe burst...

disabling the drill completely.

Here it is.

I could not see if it was a boy or a girl.

Let it be a surprise, Alex.

I don't wanna know.

As long as you two are good.

That's all that matters.

Dad ...

Alex.

I've missed you.

Another one of us.

No no no.

People do not need to see that.

People don't need to see that, people don't need to see that.

And the fact that I was in the military...

allowed me to know how to organize people.

You're famous, Mario.

Don Francisco was here.

He said last night ...

You were the most famous man in Chile.

Don Francisco said that?

We will get you out.

And to see your families...

by Christmas.

We'll be waiting for you. Goodbye and God bless.

All right, he's gone. - Christmas?

Listen, listen!. - There are three months!

No, listen! Listen to me!

Disappointing news from Chile. The Canadian drill, Plan C ...

has been shut down indefinitely due to unexpected technical difficulties.

The drill and its team, who the families had high hopes for...

is now heading home.

Have your husband sign them.

And please ...

If you have any questions, call me. OK?

I'm gonna read it and... talk to Mario.

We're talking about a...

a lot of money.

Katty ...

keep it to yourself.



How are you?

Somehow I'll give you enough money so that your husbands don't have to work for a year.

I'm gonna give each $10,000.

Dario.

Dario.

The huge slab of rock, the so called "mega stone"...

twice the size of the Empire State Building...

is believed to shift in the last few hours.

This has added yet more urgency...

to the rescue effort here at the surface.

DAY 50

We hit steel.

Looks like a horizontal support beam or something.

We busted the bit.

The bitch is stuck down in that borehole, like a dummy.

Replace the bit.

No, the piece of bit is 1420 feet down there.

We are not drilling until we get that piece of bit out of there.

However that is.

I'm calling my contacts in Brazil getting some big old magnets.

Mario, there's no drills. They're not drilling.

Are you listening to me?

OK, all right.

Hey, Yonni, listen to this.

"Marta...

the wife of miner Yonni Barrios...

had Yonni's mistress removed from Camp Hope...

for the third time.

Susi, Yonni's mistress...

is happy being a home wrecker. "

Now the whole world thinks that Susi is a whore...

and that I am a two-time scumbag.

Well...

That's not right.

I cannot believe this.

"Our fearless leader, Super Mario...

Who would tell anyone who is willing to listen...

than he is the one solely responsible for our survival...

has been offered a book deal...

for an undisclosed sum. "

An undisclosed sum, uh?

What's that sum, Mario?

Were you planning on ...?

have any of us in this book, do you?

Did you do it? - Of course he did it.

You know what, Fearless Leader?

We're going to get along  just fine without you.

Do you really think I need you?

Any of you?

You know, a leader...

makes sure you don't starve.

The leader keeps the lights on.

No, no, no, you got some help with the lights on.

Yes, me.

What you doing?

Do not need you! - This is your fault!

We've had enough.

Get out! Get out of here!

The leader never gives up.

You know?

You would not be here if it wasn't for me.

I never asked for this.

You gave it to me.

You listen to me, Golborne.

None of your drills are working.

That is unacceptable!

We spent millions of dollars bringing that down.

and we made no secret of that.

Now you tell me the American drill is down?

The drill bit fractured in the borehole...

but we are magnets coming in from Brazil.

Heavy duty magnets.

I don't want to hear about your magnets!

The mine is crumbling!

We are running out of time, Golborne.

There's talks of lawsuits and...

criminal charges from the families.

I don't have to tell you...

the miners occupy...

a privileged position in the affections of the Chilean people.

The last thing we need is these men dying! ...

with the whole world watching!

I don't think it is going too far to say...

That the future of this administration depends on the outcome.

Mr. President, I can...

DAY 54

Dario.

Would you want to say something to me?

You know Maria, my sister, right?

Yeah.

I've been mad at her all my life.

She abandoned me when I was just a kid.

I mean, she was a kid also...

and she had already raised my five siblings.

She just needed her own life.

I couldn't see that before.

I know she's up there, I know she's waiting for me, but...

What I am supposed to say?

I mean, what am I supposed to do when we get out?

If we get out.

You hug her...

and cry like a baby.

and forgive everything she's ever done.

And pray to God that she forgives you.

She's your family.

Mara is the only family you've got.

Family...

Family is all we have.

That's my iPod.

You are a thief, Bolivian Indian.

We all have iPods. - It is my iPod.

Not yours. - Give me my iPod!

Not yours! - Give me my iPod!

Not yours, Elvis!

Mamani!

Stop!

Look at me!

Look, look at me!

That's the devil guiding hand.

Give it to me.

You are gonna kill a man...

over this piece of shit?

For why?

Because some fat cat says he will give us some money?

Because some whore writes some gossip...

about your family life?

Come over here. Come over here.

So what?

So, some people would bring your balls because you're a Bolivian, you're a Bolivian?

What it that, what is that?

Come on.

What about me?

Calling myself the leader down here.

Throwing my way around thinking...

you know, I am, that I, that I did everything on my own.

No.

This is not me.

This is not us.

We, we all know what is up there.

Is a circus.

Unless not get too far ahead of ourselves.

Unless don't do that...

Because we are not going to get anything out of this.

Anything.

We walked in as miners and we will walk out as...

miners.

I didn't sign the book deal.

Was I going to?

Yes.

Did I want to provide for my family and for my kids?

Yeah!. But I didn't.

I didn't. Why?

Because of you.

Because of you are, you are my brothers.

If we want stay brothers, we gonna pull together...

and to get out of here.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I'm very sorry.

Welcome back, Mario.

Welcome back.

Here it comes!

I knew It! Yes!

Back to work!

Vicente! Hey!

Come on, get up.

Let's get ourselves some miners.

We got it out. We're gonna restart.

Lieutenant.

Take down the fence.

All of it.

Yes sir.

Come in. Everyone.

DAY 58

You're coming too close to an iron support beams.

If she hits those beams, that drill's a goner.

We're going to have to clear it ourselves from down here.

How?

With a controlled explosion.

No, no, Don Lucho. That's a negative.

The mountain is completely unstable. You need another option.

We know.

We know is unstable...

but it's the only way.

We are all ready to get out of here...

or die trying.

Alex!

Mario!

We're going to booster the beam with these timbers here.

The charges will be placed there, according to this.

Jessi.

I'll take you to the hospital.

No, I'm staying here, Don Jose.

I'm not leaving Alex.

Susi.

From Yonni.

He wrote to me.

Oh my God.

He spoke to the Minister. You belong to Camp Hope with that.

I can do come in? - Yes.

Martha, why are you leaving us?

I decided to leave him.

He doesn't deserves a woman like me.

Besides, he farts in his sleep.

Excuse me.


Yes, come on here! - OK, OK

Sit down!

Thank you! Save...!

Rescue Carlos Mamani. My son, OK? - OK - Don't worry Jack

Thank you, thank you! Carlos Mamani, OK? - You are friends now!

Are you ladies ready? -- Yeaah!!

How nice for a first day, huh, Bolivia?

Sure you put in for some overtime. Come on, baby.

Three...!

Two...

One!

Look!

There she comes!

All right, We're in!

You did! Thank you, Jeff!

You're the new national hero of Chile.

Painted in the colors of the national flag...

This is Phoenix 1...

the rescue capsule in which the Chilean authorities...

along with most of the world...

are now their hopes pinned on.

This metal cage is designed to haul up the 33 miners one by one...

from 700 meters below ground...

to the sunlight they haven't see now for 62 days.

Open up.


Is sinking.

How fast?

Too fast.

Do you see this green line?

We mark this down yesterday.

Do you see how far is come down?

I think the explosion is done this job.

700,000 tons of rock...

Sitting just directly  over their heads.

Is not a question of if it falls, but when.

OK guys, this is the situation:

We just don't have time to reinforce the shaft.

If anything happens to the Phoenix capsule...

if its mechanism fails, or the walls of the shaft collapse...

I have to tell you...

that there is a real possibility we can't get you guys out.

The guy who goes first...

will be in the greatest danger.

But could also be the only one to make it out.

You decide who that man will be.

October 13, 2010

DAY 69

Phoenix.

Sir?

We're ready for initiation.

Yea! - Good luck, Alex!

See you all, men...

Up there. OK? OK



We are ready.

Sir, they're good to go.

Good.

On the count of three, begin the ascent.

SBeginning the ascent in...

3, 2...

Come on!

700 meters.

Mr. Vega is looking good.

The capsule is holding steady. 500 m.

500 meters mark.

Look, his heart rate is all over the place.

He is nervous. Who wouldn't be?

The mountain is stable.

Everything is good.

The rate of ascent is within normal parameters.

400 meters.

300 meters.

Ignacio, what happened?

The capsule is grafting the borehole and we lost biometrics.

There is a problem.

Hey, hey!

We don't have a visual down there.

I'm gonna try and reverse it.

Don Lucho.

The capsule is stuck.

They're reversing the Phoenix.

What happened?

Here we go.

OK, beginning descent.

Is he breathing?

We have no way of knowing what his oxygen supply is.

Hey.

Light up down there - Anything?

I'm gonna try again.

The wheel stopped.

It's moving.

The capsule is moving.

What happened?

We lost Alex.

They lost contact.

He made it?

He made it! Yes!

Dad!  - Son

This is your baby girl.

Esperanza (Hope).

Oh man, a girl.

Mario.

Good luck, Mario.

See you soon.

Goodbye, huevones!

I love you!

I love you!

Yeah baby!!! Come in!

Ha ha ha! Coming Katty!

Minister. Finally I meet you.

Call me Laurence, Mario. Laurence

Mario! Over here!

Hey, my brothers, thank you!

Thank you for everything!

Let's go for a "Chi"!

Let's go for a "le"! Chi Chi Chi Le Le Le


Over a billion people all over the world witness this miracle in the Atacama desert.

After 69 days is going to be a very long night in the San Jose Mine. But nobody will go to sleep.

Thank you for everything you did for us!

Thank you for never giving up!

I love you, Copiapo!

Yonni! Yonni!

Susi! - I love you!

Dario, Dario.

My sister Maria Segovia. Do you know her?

By there.

Dario! Dario!

Where?

Maria?

Maria?

Maria?

Thank you.

Thank you.

Here lived 33 miners August 5 to October 13

God was with us
