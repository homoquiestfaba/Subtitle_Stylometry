Her.

Oh! Ah!

Oh, my God, please don't wave.

<i>Why not?</i>

I...I don't know.

Oh, she's a tiny little nothing.

I can't see her anymore.

I can't see her anymore;
I'm going upstairs.

Don't lose her!

Jill, she was here.

<i>What?</i>

She was standing
in the living room.

She was...
<i>Where'd you go? Are you there?</i>

<i>By the gate.
She's over by the gate!</i>

Well, she asked me

I'm sorry, sir.
Security measures.

All three of today's flights
have been canceled, sir.

You've got to be joking.

I am sorry
for this inconvenience.

The best I can do is offer you
a hard ticket

for the same flight
leaving tomorrow.

What?
No.

What about another airline?

You're more than welcome
to do that, sir.

No, you do it.

But just so you know,
this ticket is nonrefundable,

as it was purchased
for your company

by using frequent flier miles.

Would you like me to go ahead

and book you
on tomorrow's flight?

Fine.

I can offer you
a complimentary room

at an affiliated hotel
near the airport.

I...I don't need a hotel.

I...I live here.

I just need a flight out.

Well, here you go.

I am sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

WOMAN OVER INTERCOM:
<i>Paging passenger Devlin Terry.</i>

<i>Devlin Terry, please...</i>

[PLANE ENGINE ROARING]

<i>Uh, I was in the backyard.</i>

<i>I was painting,
and the doorbell rang,</i>

and, boom,
she was standing there.

She seemed very regular.

<i>Really?
Was she beautiful?</i>

Well, no.

I mean, you know,
she's not a kid.

She's like us.
<i>Huh.</i>

I thought maybe she was calling

to say "thank you" for the note.

<i>What note?</i>
The note.

I told you;
I wrote her a note.

<i>No, you didn't.</i>

Yes, I did, when she moved in.

I wrote her a note
saying that I was a friend

of the woman whose house
she was renting and...

<i>Since when?</i>
Jill.

And just that if she needed
to know how anything worked...

<i>Oh, please.
And then what?</i>

I was just being friendly.

<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

<i>And then if she could
introduce you</i>

<i>to some of
her celebrity friends,</i>

<i>that would be okay, too?</i>

Jill.
<i>What?</i>

I was just being nice.

And she is not a movie star,
for God's sakes.

She's just an actress.

I'm up in my bedroom.

What about this?

Oh, who cares?
You're doing her a favor.

Wear that thing from Bergdorf's.

I don't want her to think
I got dressed up.

So why are you?

When are you taking her?

Later this afternoon.

Oh, my God, Jill,

you've got to pick up the kids
from practice if I'm with her.

All right, well,
that's all right.

I have Pilates anyway.

So why does she need you,
anyway?

I don't know.
What does that mean?

Maybe she doesn't drive.

She couldn't call a taxi?

Well, I...I don't mind.

You know, she hasn't
so much as said "hello"

since she's been here.

I am sure a person like that
probably needs her privacy.

Then why not call a taxi?

She may not want to be alone
all the time either.

She's probably a bitch.

Why?

I don't know, just 'cause

they probably all
have to be like that

<i>to get where they are.</i>

<i>All right,
would you stop already?</i>

<i>I'm serious.</i>

<i>Hey, you know what was weird,
though?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>I mean, not weird but...</i>

<i>What?
Tell me.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>It looked like
she had been crying.</i>

<i>Crying?
Why?</i>

<i>How do I know?</i>

Okay, if anybody finishes early,

you may excuse yourself quietly

and go to the cafeteria
and eat your lunch, okay?

[DOG BARKS]

Yeah?

<i>Come on.

Well, I told you already.

I am on a plane.

No, wait.

<i>Just morning.</i>

It's not temperate

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>It's just regular.</i>

<i>Ma, dad's on the phone!</i>

Oh, no, no, snoopy, don't go.

Don't go. Tell me...
Tell me what you're doing.

Nothing.

Are you upstairs?

No.

Yeah?
Well, then where?

Your office.

Oh, are you drawing?

Oh, my God.

Yeah.

You're not using my good pens,

Uh, no.

You're a good girl, snoopy.
You know that?

I know.

You know I love you?

I know.

<i>Hello.</i>

Hey, it's me.

<i>I was downstairs

<i>What's wrong?</i>

Nothing.

So what's...what's wrong
with the...

What's wrong with the washer?

Why are you calling
from the plane?

I just am.

It's the same thing.

What, it doesn't soak or what?

No, it soaks.

It just doesn't spin
the water out after,

so it ends up flooding
out the back.

I don't know
where it's coming from.

Why don't you call the guy

and have him come
and look at it?

What?

You know, call the guy.

You said we couldn't afford...

It's fine.

You know, we need it,

so let's have him come in
and look at it.

This is going to be a fortune.

It's fine.

How is it going to be fine?

It's...it's fine.

<i>Well, I didn't expect
to hear from you.</i>

I just called to talk to Emmie.

I mean...


So what are you doing?

Well, I was with the washer,

and now I'm cleaning up
after breakfast.

You're not sitting around,
eating bonbons?

Well, if cleaning up
after breakfast

sounds like fun to you,
then, yeah, I'm having a blast.


You certainly sound happy.

I don't know.

Yeah.

Okay, I don't know
what we're doing here.


Is something wrong?

Never.


This phone call
is costing a fortune.

Ah, come on.

Come on?
Come on what?

<i>You suddenly decide
to be in a good mood?</i>

<i>Were you there last night?</i>

I don't know who the hell
I'm talking to.

Forget it.

No.

Not forget it.

Talk.

I am talking.
That's what I was doing.

About what?

I'm...I'm going...

I'm going to hang up.

Then do.

Hang up.

It's not much of one, really,

it's actually a lot more...

Oh, God, this is
the movie theater.

Oh, yeah.

Have you been?
Oh, God, it's wonderful.

It's so beautiful.

It's so old.

God, you would probably
really love it.

Oh, listen to me.

It's probably the last thing
you want to be doing

when you're not working, right?

But they do get
a lot of interesting things

out here, you know,
like indie films from the city;

some offbeat, you know,
little stuff.

I bet you'd probably
really like that.

I mean, who's kidding who,
you know?

We go to that big
Hollywood stuff all the time.

I got two kids;
you have to, you know?

But I think you have
to balance it out,

I think, you know?

But, actually, we're very much
into that art house stuff.

Actually, you know, I paint.

Really?
Yeah.

You know, just for me.

I...I used to show
in some galleries down here,

but I've stopped that.

It's a whole, you know,
other scene.

But now it's just for me.

I get a lot out of it;
it's like therapy, I guess.

I think artwork can be,
you know,

like a form of therapy,
don't you think?

I...I don't know.
I'm not an expert.

Yeah, that's interesting.

You know, that's...that's

She...she owns a gallery
down on main street.

Well, she used to, anyway.

I don't...I don't know

I'm sure.

I'm like you;

'Cause if you don't,

some of these people
just swallow you alive.

No names, but...

I feel...

I think what you just did
was so great,

and I...I...

It was so real.

I know I keep saying that,
but it really was.

Can I tell you something?

And I don't want
to make you uncomfortable,

but I was just saying
to my friend

right before I came
to pick you up,

I was just saying
that I bet somebody like you

probably just wants to talk
every once in a while

to somebody regular, you know?

You probably
just want to be treated

like everybody else, right?

Thank you.

I mean, can I be honest
for a minute

that I didn't know what to
expect, you know, meeting...

You know, like,
you think to yourself

how you would act, and then...
But I knew it.

I knew, deep down, I knew

that you were just like
everybody else.

So what's going on?

All right,
can I tell you something?

That if you knew me better,
you would know

that if there is one thing
that I'm good at,

it's being a shoulder to cry on.

It's okay.

I knew it as soon
as you got in the car.

This is crazy!

I see you over there,

and I don't know how
to help you...

Stop!

Please, stop.

for this kind of thing.

If this is what you wanted,

you should have gotten Natalie
to drive you, okay?

[PEOPLE TALKING]

What happened?

Nothing, nothing.

Someone got hit.
It's over.

Who got hit?

Nobody, somebody.

Some chick got hit.

It's over.
Leave it alone.

You a reporter?

Well, was it a black chick?

Why?
Do you know her?

No, no, I don't know her.

But did you see it happen?

No, I didn't see it.

The kid saw it.

But leave it alone, huh?

Call it a day, huh?

Thanks.

[CAR ALARM BLARING]

Could I ask you something?

You saw the lady that got hit?

Yeah.

Was it a black lady?

Yeah.

Okay, it was.

So how old a lady was it?

He don't know that.

What happened?

She wasn't looking.

She be all like this
with her pocketbook.

Was she wearing a blue dress?

Yeah, she was wearing
a blue dress.

She ain't seen nothing.

Yes, I did.

And I saw her sister
leaning over her

when they put the sheet on top.

Her sister?

I don't know, someone.

She was wearing
a bright-colored dress.

But was it a bright blue dress?

I don't know.

Think.

Was it...was it bright blue?

You knew her, right?

No, I...
I just want to make sure...

Then tell a cop.

They're looking for someone
who knew her.

Tell the cop.

No, I don't know her.

She just said that she lived
around here...

Excuse me!
He knows her!

He knows her.

Go on and tell a cop.

You know what?
Forget it.

around here?

Because she said she lived
around a bakery.

You know what?
There's one up on "J" street.

Yeah, on the top
