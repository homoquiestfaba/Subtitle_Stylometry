(male #1)
Cause of death?

Asthma, heart attack,
they're not sure.

His name was Phillip Taylor.

The little boy's Joshua.
It's his son.

Has the kid said anything?

Oh, he's devastated.

He's not saying much
of anything right now.

So who are they?

Lady on the left
is the neighbor.

The other one is Anna.

She's a maid.

She doesn't speak
a lot of English,

but from what I can tell
she was upstairs cleaning,

heard the dogs barking, ran
downstairs, and called us.

Sir, I found an address
book of the deceased,

a few other documents
as well.

Okay, good.

Let's go through it, find
a friend or coworker, anybody.

Poor kid.

No immediate family,
now this?

(female #1)
There's a Henry
and Lucille Bauman listed here.

Is there
a phone number?

Yeah, I got
a phone number right here.

Contact them
both immediately.

Inform them
of the situation.

Stay with the boy
and get him somewhere safe.

I'll finish out the reports,
meet you back at the office.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

I miss you, Dad.

I couldn't ever imagine
feeling so empty and so alone.

But here I am.

I tried to reach him!

I tried.
I really did!

Oh, Joshua,
I know you did.

I know.

It's going to be
all right now.

It's going to be
all right.

Christopher, would you please
take Joshua inside

and help him get settled?

Yes, ma'am.

(female #2)
Mrs. Lucille Bauman?

I'm Karen Green, the caseworker
for the adoption agency,

and this is Mr. Richard Smith,
the attorney for the Taylors.

Mrs. Bauman, we spoke
earlier on the phone today.

Yes.
Nice to meet you both.

My husband's on his way home.

Would you like to come
in and take a seat?

No thanks, Mrs. Bauman.

We won't be very long.

I really hate
that we had to meet

under such circumstances
as this.

Well, Phillip
was very dear to us

and we're going to miss
him dearly.

Where do we go
from here?

Mrs. Bauman, do you recall
the adoption agreement that you

and your husband made to serve
as caretakers for Joshua

that it stated
in Mr. Phillip's will?

Yes, we do recall.

Mrs. Bauman, what's
the zip code here?

78218.

You know, it's really great
for Joshua that both families

had this agreement worked out.

Frankly, many children
end up with families

that they don't even know.

I'm just so glad
that we could help Joshua.

Ma'am, if you would sign
this release form

for the release of Joshua.

And you do have our deepest
condolences on this

unexpected tragedy
of your friend.

Thank you.

Is there anything that
we can do at the house?

Actually, Mrs. Bauman,
the house is in foreclosure.

Joshua did have time to get
his things out of the house

that he needed,
and frankly, the bank

has taken over possession
of the home.

Mrs. Bauman, if this is
too much of a burden

for you all at once--

Ms. Greene, all my burdens
have been taken to the cross.

Well, that's great
to know, Mrs. Bauman.

And I'm sure Joshua
is in great hands.

Again, you have
our condolences.

Thank you so much.

Mrs. Bauman, if you
or your husband need anything,

anything at all, don't
hesitate to give us a call.

There's my card.

Thank you both.
And God bless you.

Thank you.

Hey, Joshua, I'm really
sorry about your dad.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Aren't you angry?

I mean,
both of your parents?

Kind of.

Sort of.

You, your dad
were always at church

and you never missed
Sunday school.

So why would God take them
both away from you like that?

My father always told me,
"God has a purpose

for all things even if we
don't understand it."

Well, I don't understand.

Anyway, come on.

Let's play a board game.

Why?

You always beat me
in everything we play.

'Kay.

Under the circumstances,
I'll be nice.

This time only.

Nah.
I'm just tired.

Thanks, though.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Obey...

God's Word.

No!

Daddy!

No!

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


Let's give it up one more
time for Sound of Praise.


Well, I want to thank
everybody for coming out today

to the third annual Attorneys
for Christ Association Luncheon.

Let me bring up here the
newest chairman of the AFCA,

Mr. Christopher Bauman.


Thank you.

Thank you very much
for this award.

We look forward to doing
bigger and brighter things

in the Seguin Community.

Thank you very much.


(male #2)
Well, if it isn't
the most famous,

competent lawyer
of Seguin, Texas.

Walter, how are you?

Doing good.

Your client,
Jonathan Chase,

hasn't accepted
the plea bargain.

What's the deal?

He'll plea.

Just give him some time.

I hope so.

Well, speaking of time,
I'm sorry Walter,

but there's another
meeting I have to attend.

It was good
seeing you again.

Well, don't let
me hold you up.

It's good to see you
too, Christopher.

Take care.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ª I know
the right words to say â™ª

â™ª to paint a pretty picture â™ª

â™ª to make you see
like I got it all together â™ª

â™ª yeah â™ª

â™ª Knowing good and well â™ª

â™ª there's a war
going on inside of me â™ª

â™ª between the man
that I used to be â™ª

â™ª and the man
that I'm becoming â™ª

â™ª there's something's
got to give â™ªâ™ª

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Hey, baby.

Hey.
You get to the station yet?

Yeah, I'm here.

Well, I've been trying
to call you

for like the last 2 hours.

The association had a brief
meeting at the Jazz Spot.

The Jazz Spot?

What about the home spot?

Lunch here, 12:30?

You know, it just so happens
to be that I'm your wife

and not just
one of your clients.

No, that's all right.
Thanks a lot.

Yes sir, what
can I get for you?

Hot dog.

All right, well I do them
all kinds of different ways.

I've got some
bacon wrapped-- Just mustard.

You got it.

[train whistle sounding]

I'm going to fix
this up for you.

You be careful
with that nice suit

and this mustard, all right?

Next time you come through
here, you try my bacon wrap.

They are fantastic.

That's going to be $4, sir.

Keep the change.

Appreciate that.
You be safe.

(male #3)
I'll see y'all soon, okay?
(female #3)
Be careful, okay?

I will.
I love you, Cameron.

Well, well, if it
ain't my long lost,

no time to see me
big brother.

What's happening, man?

Very busy man.

It's good to see you,
man.

Good to see
you too, free man.

Yeah, right. Welcome home.

How's Mama?

Well, you know Mom.
She's fine.

Still trying to win
everyone over to the Lord.

Yeah, so what
about you, man?

You been won over?

Look, Josh, it's been
a long time since we've seen

one another,
11 years to be exact.

When we were younger,
I never missed Sunday school,

I never missed
a youth retreat.

So I don't need church.

I'm doing just fine.

So to answer your question,
no, I have not been won over.

â™ª Something's
got to give, hey â™ªâ™ª

Jonathan Chase,
how you doing?

Where's my lawyer?

Well you see, he was--he
got caught up in a--he had a--

Mario,
where's my lawyer?

Jonathan, I called
him earlier today.

I don't know what happened.

I just don't know
what happened.

Mr. Chase, can I get you
to have a seat please, sir?

Okay, look.
Here's where we are.

This is where you stand.

It's kind of got a lot
of evidence, but look,

we can work through
this as a team, okay?

All rise
and come to order.

District Court 278
is now in session.

The Honorable Judge Reeves
is presiding.

All have a seat, please.

Today, we're going
to do the docket,

the State versus
Jonathan Chase.

Your Honor,
I need a new attorney!

Sit down or you're
going to county jail.

Wow, just relax,
all right?

We'll take care of this.

Just let me handle this.

Your Honor, may I
approach the bench?

Please come forward.

Your Honor,
I apologize for that.

My name is Mr. Mark McClain
and Mr. Bauman

from Bauman and Associates,
he had a family emergency.

Emergency?

This is an emergency!

Curb that defendant!

Look, I don't need this
new recruit paralegal

trying to represent me!

Where's my lawyer?

(Judge Reeves)
Bailiff, take this defendant
into custody right now.

Mr. Chase, you've been
ordered by the court

to be taken into custody.

You can put your hands
behind your back;

keep them away
from your pockets.

Sit down!

Oh, this is not good.

I told you not
to be saying anything.

Just keep your mouth shut,
okay?

Just be quiet.

You tell Bauman
you reap what you sow.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Man, Chris, I ain't
even going to lie.

I'm impressed, man.

You really got it
going on in here.

Thank you.

University of Monroe, huh?

It's a nice office, man.

Look here, I've got a meeting
with my staff in a few minutes

and also I've arranged for
a taxi to come and pick you up.

Man, a taxi?

Look Joshua, Mom's been
looking forward to seeing you

for a real long time.

Last time you let her down.

Don't do it again.

You understand?

Yeah man, look,
don't worry,

I'm not messing anything up.

I couldn't mess it
up this time, dude.

Look, I got a son
to look after now, man.

A son?

You never mentioned
before that you had a son.

Yeah, man,
that's my little boy.

He's growing up.

You know, I've been gone
for a long time now,

so I'm going to do whatever
I can to make it up to him.

Well, I know he's looking
forward to having his daddy

in his life.

Being adopted seemed to be
the hardest transition for me

to handle, a lifelong
road of uncertainty.

Losing dad left
emptiness in my heart.

I'd give anything to
extinguish this deep,

innermost root of loneliness,
to find a true peace.

No wonder after 11 years
of hard time incarceration

I still feel locked up inside.

[phone ringing]

Hello?

(female #4)
Mom?

Sarah,
is that you?

Sarah?

It's me, I'm here.

Baby, what's wrong?

I can't take it anymore.

Our marriage
is falling apart.

Sarah, what's
exactly going on?

Talk to me.

I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't understand.

It seems like the more I try,
the worse our relationship gets.

I mean, I cooked him dinner
and he stood me up again.

Mm-hmm.

Sarah, I know it's hard,
but you can't lose heart.

There is hope.

I tell you what,

why don't we meet tomorrow
evening for dinner

at our favorite spot?

I'd like that.
Thanks, mom.

I really appreciate that.

But please
do not tell Christopher

that I talked to you
about this.

I promise.

All right, I'll see you tomorrow
if it's the Lord's will.

Okay.

Okay.
Bye-bye.

Okay, bye.

[door bell ringing]

Come in!

Mama.

Oh, Joshua.

Oh, thank the Lord
you made it home safely.

It's good
to see you, Mama.

Oh, it's good
to see you too.

And you look so good!

Oh man, I feel good.

It's nice to be home.

Oh, how was
your train ride?

Train ride was good.
It was refreshing, you know?

And the ride with Chris,
that was a little tough.

That's another story.

Son,
it's not Christopher.

You know, he's carrying
his own burdens, you know?

And until both of you
totally surrender to God,

your problems
are going to overcome you

instead of you
overcoming your problems.

I know, Ma.

You know,
I'm just getting home.

We'll get to that,
but it's just--

Nothing.

I'll tell you what,
it's one thing to know

and it's another thing to obey.

Anyway, come on in
and have some of my

good ol' homemade
cranberry bread.

Whew.

Okay.

Where are we?

Total new clients
this week: 18.

Total retainer's fee:
$47,250.

And the bad news
is this Mr. Chase guy,

he doesn't want to accept any
plea bargains and he's demanding

that you specifically
represent him in court.

He'll plea.

No, listen.

Look, he's not accepting
any plea bargains

and he's not playing around.

Look, I just got off the phone
with some of his boys

and they're demanding 15 of
the $25,000 refunded.

Seems to me like you're
being a little sensitive here.

Or maybe I'm just trying
to do my job

building
a respectable reputation.

Maybe, but understand this,
this is a respectable law firm.

Look, I understand
Mr. Bauman.

But look, I won't compromise
my integrity to lose my family.

Stop!

Are you calling me a crook?

You're fresh off
the college block!

Let me tell you
something, rookie.

You need to adjust
to the program.

Well, this program needs to
be winding down by 7 o'clock!

Gentlemen, please!

It's Friday.

Let's just calm down,
finish the briefing

so we can all go home
and enjoy the weekend.

Okay?

Whatever.

Look here rookie,

you need to go handle
your business.

Okay.

Documents complete.

This case is ready for
trial Monday morning.

All right.

Thanks so much for staying
late to finish the briefing.

No problem.

I talked to Ron earlier
and let him know the importance

of this case and he knew I was
going to work late tonight.

You know what?

Since you've been
working late all week,

why don't you take Monday off?

No, why don't
you take Monday off?

Your wife really
deserves it, Christopher.

[phone ringing]

[answering machine beeping]

Sarah, hey.

I'll be home late again.

I had some important business
to finish at the office.

Business.

Always the priority.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Dear Christopher,
it's been 4 1/2 years

since we had true
quality time together.

I miss your small but
spur-of-the-moment surprises.

I've forgotten the last time
we even prayed together,

not to mention our lack
of daily communication,

which only consists of
"Good morning" or "Good night."

Your law practice has
taken over our whole life.

Do you even care that
we're drifting apart?

Sarah, your wife.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[phone ringing]

Hello?
Hello?

Christopher?

Christopher,
I am sick and tired

of all these phone calls
and hang-ups.

Christopher?

He's gone!

I'm finished.

I am done!

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[door bell rings]

Mrs. Bauman? Yes.

You have
a delivery.

Thank you.

You must be very
special to someone.

I suppose I am.

Well you have
a nice day, ma'am.

Thank you, you too.

What?
What?

[glass shattering]

(female #5)
Girl, I am so sorry about
this mess with your husband.

Just men.

You need to divorce
that creep.

And considering
being threatened,

I'd take out a good life
insurance policy if I were you.

No, I don't think
Why not? I could do that.

Well, for one, there's no
divorce lawyer in Seguin

that's going to represent me.

Two, you need money,
that which I don't have.

Well, listen, you let
me take care of all that,

including the life insurance.

I'll set you up with
a good attorney.

A local friend of mine is
a life insurance agent.

I'll cover the costs. No.

Ah, Ah, Ah.

You just remember that
anything happens to him,

I get half the policy, deal?

Deal.
You're so silly.

Shush, here comes
my mother-in-law.

I don't want her to think that
we're plotting against her son.

Ma?

Hi.

Hi, Sarah.

Sorry I'm a little bit late.

It's okay.

How are you?

I'm not doing too good.

But this is my friend, Joey.

Joey Perkins.

Joey, this is my
mother-in-law, Lucille Bauman.

Nice to meet you.

So tell me, is it Joey
or Joanna Perkins?

Well, my birth name
is Joanna Perkins,

but that's not what I go by.

Well, if you don't mind,
I'd rather call you

by your birth name,
Joanna Perkins.

Is that fine?

That's fine.

(male #4)
Hi, are we ready to order?

You know what?

I don't have much of
an appetite right now.

I'll pass also.

Okay, if you need anything else,
just let me know.

Okay, thank you.

Okay.

What's really going on Sarah?

Well, I moved out.

And mom, you know how
much I love Christopher,

but I'm scared, angry,
and I'm just fed up of all of

the threatening phone calls
and of the angry clients.

I mean, besides,
I don't ever see him.

So where are you staying?

Well, after this last
episode, my friend Joey,

Joanna, she has opened up her
home to me and I'm going to stay

with her until I
get an apartment.

Ma'am, I don't
mean to intervene,

but I've known Sarah
for a very long time.

And for what
she's been going through,

she deserves better.

And how do you
define better?

Happiness, security, love.

Joanna, when you look
deep within yourself,

are you truly happy?

Truthfully?

No.

I guess once my father stopped
showing me he cared about me,

I just kind of gave up.

Had he been there for me, well,
let's just say I might not

have turned out
like I am today.

God's love has always
been there for you, Joanna.

It's just that you haven't
allowed the Word to give you

the peace, joy, and true
happiness that only he can give.

Joanna, Jesus Christ
can change your life.

I'll see you later, Sarah.

Okay.

I didn't mean to
offend your friend, Sarah,

but the truth must
come to light.

I know, Mom.
Don't worry about it.

She'll be okay.

She'll be fine.

I sure hope so.

Speaking of the truth,
Sarah, you listen to me.

You are a bright woman

and you can't let
your friends influence you.

Trust me,
I know how you feel.

In our eyes, it seems right
to divorce our husbands

when things don't
seem to be going right.

But that's not God's way.

He hates divorce.

Yes, but I'm not
as strong as you are.

I wish I was.

And I know that you tell me
to pray for our relationship

and to just stop complaining
about what it's not.

But didn't your husband leave
you even though you

earnestly prayed for him?

Yes, he did.

But he is still my husband.

And I won't divorce him.

I'm still praying and trusting
that God is going to

reconcile him back home.

You think God's still going
to bring him back to you?

Well, he said if I have
the faith of a mustard seed,

I can move a mountain.

And also if I ask and I
don't doubt, I shall receive.

He didn't say maybe.

So yes, I do believe that he
is going to bring him home.

Okay, Mom.
Okay.

[phone beeping]

(female #6)
Mr. Bauman, you have
a call on line one.

Stacy, take a message.

I'm in a meeting right now.

As I was saying,
the D.A's office--

Mr. Bauman, Mr. Bauman,
we paid you $25,000 cash

and you haven't set foot
in court to represent

Mr. Jonathan Chase.

You don't answer his calls
from jail and not once,

not once have you visited
him to discuss his case.

Now I'm politely
requesting a full refund.

What are you, kidding?

You got jokes, right?

Does it look like
I'm joking?

Does this look like
a flea market bargaining table?

Listen, Mr. Jonathan Chase chose
this law firm to represent him

and you agreed
to pay his legal fees.

And we're doing everything
we can to get him out.

Well, I'll tell you what.

Your best, it's just
not good enough.

So here's the deal.

Refund a portion
of say, say $15,000,

which is extremely more than
fair due to the fact

that you haven't done anything.

I would take seriously
a proposal to you, Mr. Bauman.

Stacy, get me
Walter from the D.A.'s office.

Yes, sir.

By the way, your
brother's on hold for you.

What is it, Joshua?

Hey, I was gonna pass
over and see my son today.

I thought you might
want to come meet him.

Listen, Joshua.

I don't have time
to discuss this,

but I'm sure your son will feel
glad about the opportunity

of seeing his father.

Man.

So what do we do now?

Business as usual.

Let's keep going.

Okay, well, his
court date's scheduled--

Hey, Kelly.
It's good to see you.

Joshua, what
are you doing here?

I'm here to get some of
Kelly Marie's Hot Wings.

Best in the world.

Yeah, well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

The last time I entertained
you with a home cooked meal,

we both fell into sin.

Hey look, Kelly, I'm
just here 'cause I told you,

you know, when I got out,
I wanted to make things

better between us.

So, you know, here I am.

I know I've been absent
from my son's life--

Absent from our son.

Okay, yeah, absent from our
son's life for a long time,

but, you know, I promise
I'm gonna make it up to him.

You know, can I
at least see him?

He's at basketball practice.

Joshua, don't make any
promises you can't keep.

Look, you know,
I'm just trying to say

that I want to be here
for him, you know?

I want to be a real positive
role model in his life.

Oh, he's got a role model.

What do you mean
he's got a role model?

You got a man now
or something?

Yeah.

Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do have somebody in my life.

Somebody who won't leave us.

Somebody who provides
all of our needs.

I hope you get
to meet him soon.

Man, the only person I want
to see right now is my son.

Look Joshua, I got a lot
of studying to do so

I am going to get my cooking
degree this time around

without any
of your distractions.

So if you really
want to see your son,

then why don't you meet us at
Casey's on Saturday at noon?

Okay.

I'll be there.

And hey, I'm gonna help you
open your franchise one day.

Kelly Marie's Hot Wings.

Whatever.
Goodbye, Joshua.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Mr. Taylor, hi.

I'm Laura Miles.

I'm the business loan
officer for the branch.

Nice to meet you.

Well, I have to say
I'm very impressed

with your
hot wing business concept.

That's what
I'm talking about.
Very interesting.

Unfortunately, our bank will
not be able to assist you

with this business loan.

What do you mean you can't
assist me with the loan?

Mr. Taylor, unfortunately,
your credit scores are low.

You have no collateral.

Frankly, you have
no business track record.

You simply do not
Look-- qualify for this loan.

But this is
an awesome concept.

And people will
love Kelly's wings.

So, I mean, as much
as they love these wings,

we could turn that kind
of profit around in no time.

A couple months, tops.

There's gotta be some way
I qualify for half that

or something.

I'm afraid not.

All right.

I'll tell you, though,
Kelly Marie's Hot Wings,

is gonna make it someday.

Hey, Chris.

Hey, Chris.
Hold up, man.

Hey, Chris, man.

I need your help, dude.

I've been out here looking
for work and trying to hustle,

but man, I really need
a business loan, bro.

A business loan?

Yeah, look.
Check it out.

I got everything put
together already, man.

$35,000?

Yeah, man.

Don't worry
about $35,000.

Just, you know,
give me a chance, dude.

Give you a chance?

Let's see.

We gave you a chance
to go to college,

but instead you chose jail
and hurt mom at the same time.

You blew it, so you don't
get any more chances.

I can't help you,
little bro.

My little Lucille,
I'll never leave you.

Okay.

Hey, Mama.

Hey, son.

How was your day?

Don't even ask how
my day went, Mama.

Okay.

Well, tonight's
Bible study.

Are you coming?

No, not tonight.

I'm gonna look through this
paper and try and check out

some of these
employment opportunities.

All right.

Well, you'll be missing
out on your blessings.

Joshua, you know God's been
patiently calling you

for many years now.

[phone ringing]

When are you going to stop doing
things your own way

and start doing things his way?

Hello?

Josh!

Hey, what's up, Pablo?

Yeah.

I'll see you
a little later.

I've been trying to
catch up with you all day.

Joshua, don't
fall into temptation.

Kind of hard finding a job
when you got a record, you know?

Look, I'm about 2 minutes
from your mom's house.

Man, don't worry
about employment.

Your boy Pablo, I got you.

I'll get you a job.

All right.

Yeah, that's cool.

I'll be ready.

All right, later.

(male preacher on television)
Then the Lord spoke through
Solomon, as in Proverbs 1:10.

"My son, if sinners entice you,
do not consent if they say,

"'Come with us.

"'Let us lie and
wait to shed blood.

Let us lurk secretly for
the innocent without cause.'"

You see, beloved, your
Heavenly Father's desire

is to deliver you from
Satanic bondage.

Verse 15 goes on
to say,

"My son, do not walk in
the way with them.

Keep your foot
from their path."

Christopher!

Oh, you didn't think I'd forget
your 35th birthday, did you?

Mom, I cannot believe I
forgot my birthday is today.

And you can't
forget about God.

Look at your family
right now.

You know you need
to reconcile with Sarah.

And your practice,
you're not operating it

according to God's ways.

(Stacy on intercom)
Mr. Bauman?

Stacy, just a minute.

Well, I can see that you're
busy and I'm going to go ahead

and get going.

But first, I have
a present for you.

Happy birthday, son.

Thank you so much.

You know, Mom, the reason I
haven't been going to church is

because I've been so busy.

I mean, there's been
so much going on.

Chris, you know it's
not just about church.

It's about a heart
relationship with our Father.

And that's what you
seem to have forgotten.

I'll see you later.

Bye, love you.

Bye.

Love you.

What's up, Kelly?

Hey look, man, I'm sorry
about earlier today, you know?

I got tied up--

Stop.
Stop.

Why?

Why do you continue
to devastate our son?

You never make time
for him, Joshua.

I said I'm sorry.

You know, I don't know
what else you want from me.

What?

Here, look, I'll break
you off some cash.

Here.

I don't want to take
your money, Joshua.

I don't want it.

What's wrong with this?
Oh, that's right.

You said you got a man now.

Somebody's that's gonna
supply all your needs, huh?

I did say that.

And I also said that I hope
that you get to meet him.

Goodbye, Joshua.

Is there a problem,
officer?

Yes, sir.
Is this your vehicle?

Yeah, it is.

I need you to come over
and talk to this officer.

Man, Talk to
hold up, man. the officer.

Man, what's the problem?

Spread your feet.

Well, Mr. Joshua Taylor,
you're in possession of

a stolen vehicle and we're going
to go and take you downtown.

Yes, sir. Stolen vehicle?

Man, y'all as crazy
as they come, bro.

Tell it to the judge.

Man, I paid
Yeah, I bet. for this, cash.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Mark, I'm confident this
case won't go to trial.

There's just simply not enough
evidence of any kind of neglect

towards the children.

Hmm, I'm gonna have
to disagree, Linda.

I mean, it seems to me there's
an extreme amount of evidence

against this guy.

Where are you
getting this evidence?

Christopher,
are you okay?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

You've been having those
chest pains a lot lately.

Maybe you should go
get that checked--

Keep going.
Keep going.

'Sup, Cap?

I need to make
a phone call, man.

All right, let's
see what you got.

All right, sign in
on the clipboard

for me right there, please.

Thank you.

[phone ringing]

Bauman and Associates.

Hey listen, man,
I need some help.

I got locked up for something
I didn't even much do.

Joshua, I can't help you.

Hey, man, look, you
gotta give me a chance, bro.

Please, man, just listen.

You played the game,
now you pay the price.

Welcome to the big leagues,
little bro.

He needs to get
his life together.

So, you stole
a vehicle.

Heh.

That's a definite
10 years.

Hey, dude.

Hey.

You wasn't living
that out there,

don't come faking it in here.

(male #5)
All right, guys,
rack it up.

Let's go.

Hello, may I help you?

Yes, I'm scheduled to meet
with Mr. Bauman concerning

the cost of filing
for my divorce.

At 2:30?

Yes.

He's in a meeting
right now.

He'll be done shortly.

But while you're waiting, would
you please complete this form

and he'll be right with you.

Thank you.

You really don't want
to divorce him, do you?

No, I don't.

But I tried everything
and nothing seems to work.

Have you tried praying
and asking God

to restore your marriage?

No, I haven't.

I was in that same situation
until I realized without Christ

my marriage would
continue in turmoil.

Here's the number to
a Christian marriage counselor.

You don't need
a divorce attorney.

Your marriage
can be healed.

Would you mind
if I prayed with you?

No.

Father,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

I come before you,
interceding on behalf of

this woman, her children,
and her husband, O God.

Father, I just pray in the name
of Jesus Christ that you heal,

restore, and reconcile
this marriage.

God, I know that
you are able.

You created marriage.

And you said what
you put together,

let no man put asunder.

Keep them now
as only you can.

Hmm.

In the name of
Jesus Christ I pray, amen.

Amen.

It's gonna be
all right.

Thank you.

Okay Stacy, okay.

That if you confess with
your mouth the Lord Jesus

and believe in your heart that
God raised him from the dead,

you will be saved.

(preacher on television)
Your Heavenly Father's desire

is to deliver you
from satanic bondage.

(Mrs. Bauman)
When are you going to stop
doing things your own way

and start doing things his way?

Lord Jesus, today I
commit my life to you, God.

And I ask you to be my
personal Lord and Savior.

Forgive me, God,
for all of my sins.

For so long I've just been
livin' my life for myself,

but now, now I want to
live my life for you, God.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Dear Mom, I think you'll be
pleased to know that today

I'm truly a new man.

I've repented and truly
dedicated my whole life

to Jesus Christ.

I don't know what's gonna
come from this situation

I've foolishly
gotten myself into.

I'm incarcerated and facing
5 years for probation violation

for something I didn't do.

But now I realize that runnin'
from God is the worst position

for anyone to be in.

To live life without him
is an eternal tragedy.

I lost my dad, but now
I've found my Father.

Please inform Kelly that I'm
deeply sorry for bein' so

rebellious and procrastinating
on doin' what's right by her,

and for neglectin'
my son, Brandon.

By God's grace, I shall
remain a changed, new man.

Thanks, Mom.

You are a living proof
that God answers prayers.

Love, Joshua.

Saved by grace
I divorced the gang.

Raised in the hood,
I was forced to bang.

Threw away my nine
and I flushed the 'caine.

Since I gave my life to
Christ I'm no longer the same.

Hey man, I know some
people on the outside.

You guys lookin'
for a record deal?

I can get you guys
a record deal.

Oh really?

Anyway.

I used to do a lot of
dirt on the C-side streets.

Now I'm back on these
streets tryin' to reach--

Hey Tre, Tre, listen--it's
not a recording studio.

Could you just tone
it down a little bit?

I'll send you a CD
when I get out of here.

Thank you, I appreciate it.

Well, like I was sayin'--

So it says it right here,
2 Corinthians 5:17,

"Therefore, if any man be in
Christ, he is a new creature.

"The old things
have passed away.

Behold, all things
become new."

Good morning.

Good morning.

Where's Stacy?

Um, Mr. Bauman
just hired me.

I'm not sure who Stacy
is, but I'm Vicky.

I'm Mark McClain, one
of the attorneys here.

Nice to meet you.

Yeah, nice to meet you too.

Tell me you
did not fire Stacy.

Well, good morning
to you too, Mr. McClain.

This is my law firm.

I decide who gets hired
and who gets fired.

Look, this isn't a game.

I mean, how is it that you
claim to be a Christian,

you're the chairman

of the Attorneys for
Christ Association,

but yet everything
in your life

is so contradictory?

You know, I get it.

You make the rules
because it's your life.

Now you're gettin' it.

Now you're gettin' it.

Well, get this.

I'm makin' my own decision.

I quit!

You're a hypocrite.

(male #6)
Hey, Joshua.

What's up, Cap?

You know the police
officer that arrested you?

Well, he typed in the wrong
license plate number

and the judge has ordered
your immediate release.

Pack your things.

Okay, Mr. Taylor.

That should do it, sir.

It's your lucky day, man.

I'll tell you, though.

There's no luck
involved in that, man.

That's all about
the grace of God.

Oh, well let's see how long
his grace'll keep you

out of jail.

We'll see you
back, huh?

No, sir.

Mr. Ortiz,
Manuel Ortiz.

He'll be with you
in just a moment.

Would you like
to have a seat?

No, thank you.

Mr. Bauman?

That's me, how
can I help you?

Can we talk
somewhere private?

No, right here is fine.

We're from
the Texas Bar Association

and we've been investigating
many complaints

about this law firm
concerning accusations

of not representing
clients properly.

No communication with clients,
failure to represent clients,

and the list goes on, including
excessive attorney fees.

What evidence do you have
to support these accusations?

(male #7)
Sir, you failed to appear
before the board

to disprove these accusations.

Unfortunately,
a decision has been made.

We have sufficient evidence
showing that your practice

has had a total disregard
for proper standards

of legal representation.

Therefore, the Texas
Bar Association has made

a determination regarding
Christopher Bauman,

member number 24689738,
hereby revoking all

legal practice credentials,
effective immediately.

Give me that.

How is it no one
called me before this?

Our phone calls went
unanswered and we never received

a response from our
certified letters.

Frankly, Mr. Bauman, you've
left the Association

no other options.

(male #8)
Furthermore, Mr. Bauman,

due to the number of complaints
and threats from your clients,

the judge has granted
your landlord

a notice to vacate
the premises against you.

But he can't do that.

Ha-ha, oh, I'm afraid he can.

In fact, he already has.

Mr. Bauman, you have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

Forty-eight hours.

You can leave now.

Mr. Bauman, clock's tickin'.

Forty-eight hours.

I'm sorry, Mr. Bauman.

I'll bet you are.

No, no way.

We're not going to sit back
and just accept this without

a fight, are we Christopher?

Does this mean my first day
on the job is my last day?

Christopher!

Okay Linda, this is
what we're gonna do.

I need you to collect all
important documents

and client files
and place them in boxes.

And I'm also gonna need you to
work late tonight, all right?

Fine.

Yes, Vicky, this is gonna be
your last day workin' here.

Thanks a lot.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(male #9)
All right, man.

Hey, bro,
I appreciate it, man.

(male #9)
No problem.
You be cool.

Keep the faith
and God bless.

God bless you too.

(male #9)
All right, take care.

Now, what's goin' on
in here?

Linda.

Oh, Joshua.

Listen, I tried talking
to Christopher

to help you get out--

Hey, hey, hey, don't
worry about any of that.

God is always
in control, all right?

He got me out.

Anyway, what's all this
in here?

What's going on, y'all finally
movin' out to that big office

in the city or somethin'?

I wish.

It's not that good.

Christopher will explain.

He's in his office.

All right, I'll
go check him out.

[knocking on door]

Hey Chris, man,
what's goin' on, bro?

Seeing all these
boxes way out front.

What's really happening?

Depends on what you're
talkin' about, Joshua.

My license's been revoked,
an eviction notice that's

in effect, and a marriage
that can't be reconciled!

Maybe I'm under the judgment
of the Almighty God, you think?

Man, I'll tell you somethin'.

It doesn't matter
what I think, man.

What matters is what's
in the Word of God.

You know, the Word of God says
that if we draw near unto him,

then he'll draw
near unto us, man.

Think about it.

All these years, man, all this
time we've been runnin'

from him, you know
what I'm sayin'?

And all this time, we
should've been runnin' to him.

It's like, man, I can't stand to
see this from you, Chris, man.

It hurts my heart.

Sometime God lets this happen to
us so where we get to the point

in our lives where
we ready to repent.

Oh, so you're
all spiritual now.

You're Pastor Joshua Taylor.

Josh, I don't have
time for this!

Man, listen
bro, I'm no pastor,

but I'll tell you what I am.

I'm your brother, bro.

Even more than that,
I'm a born-again believer

in Jesus Christ, man.

I've had enough of this!

Do you believe
in Jesus now?

Do you believe
in Jesus now?

Yeah, I do.

For me to live is Christ,
to die is gain.

Man, ever since we were
little, I've despised you.

You're the reason my father
left and never came back!

Chris, I had nothing
to do with that.

Man, shut up!

You came into my life uninvited
and now you're coming in here

with this holier
than thou speech?

Chris.

Christopher,
what are you doing?

Man, stay out
of my life.

Do you understand?

Do you understand?

Christopher,
put the gun down.

If I put this down,
I never, I mean never

wanna see your face again.

Christopher, please
put the gun down.

You get it?

You get it?

It seems to be that the
greatest thing given to me now

turns out to be the hardest
thing for me to release.

Forgiveness.

I knew from this point on

I would never see
Christopher again.

Hello, Ms. Bauman.

Yes?

I haven't been able to
reach your husband, you know?

Well, Christopher and I
aren't even together anymore.

Well, that doesn't
concern me at all.

Now, you and your husband
owe us some money, correct?

I promise you, I don't know
anything about his dealings

or who he even owes money to.

Well, I promise you do.

Now I'm sure that you can find
a way somehow to persuade

your husband
to do the right thing.

Now look, I'm
a very reasonable man.

Now, you and your husband
have 90 days to deposit

$20,000 in that account.

Otherwise, someone will pay a
higher price, guaranteed, okay?

Yo man, it already looks like
there's tint on these windows,

yo, bro.

Look, I already
talked to the owner.

Just go ahead and tint
all the windows darker.

All right, man.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

It's your boy, Pablo.

Joshua?
Hello?

â™ª Why it happened
I don't understand â™ª

â™ª Searching for the answers
grasping for some truth â™ª

â™ª Lord, I need my
strength to be renewed â™ªâ™ª

[knocking on door]

Joshua.

Hey, Kelly.

Kelly, I couldn't
wait to tell you, man,

but I finally met
your provider, Kelly.

I've been saved.

You know, I've given
my life to Jesus

as my personal
Lord and Savior.

Now he's forgiven me
for all of my sins, Kelly.

And you know,
I just need you now,

I need you to forgive me for
everything I've ever done

that's hurt you, everything
I've done and--or haven't done

for our son.

Kelly, you know, I just
need you now to forgive me.

I mean, you know how long
I've been praying for you

and just cried for you?

Kelly, you know, God,
God's changed my life.

He really has and he's
definitely answered

your prayers, Kelly.

He has.

â™ª I come to bring
you praises â™ª

â™ª I come to worship you â™ª

â™ª I come to feel the warmth of
your loving arms around me â™ª

â™ª The pressures
of this day, Lord â™ª

â™ª have brought me to my knees â™ª

â™ª Restore to me the joy of
your salvation, please â™ªâ™ª

Therefore, if any man
is in Christ

he's a new creature.

â™ª Close to you â™ª

â™ª I want to be close to you â™ª

â™ª Close to you â™ª

â™ª Just to be close to you â™ª

â™ª I want to be close to you â™ª

â™ª Just to be close to you â™ª

â™ª I want to be close
to you every day â™ª

â™ª Lord, I want to be
close to you â™ª

â™ª Just to be close to you
is all I want to do â™ª

â™ª That's all I want to do â™ª

â™ª Just to be in your presence
receiving all your grace â™ª

â™ª Your love and tender mercy
I need it in this place â™ª

â™ª I want to be close to you â™ª

â™ª Just to be close to you â™ª

â™ª I want to be close to you â™ª

â™ª Just to be close to you â™ª

â™ª I got to be close to you â™ªâ™ª

(female #7)
Yes, ma'am.

And Brandon's behavior
and schoolwork

have drastically improved,
100%.


Congratulations,
son, I'm proud of you.

Thank you, Mama.

Okay, so now it's
off to Lancaster, Iowa,

where the world famous
hot wing queen

opens her first restaurant.

Excited? Oh, very.

You know, we're going to have
our first grand opening

in 5 days.

Joshua has spoken
very highly of you,

and even though we haven't
known each other very long,

I'm going to miss you.

Oh, I'm going
to miss you too.

But you know what?

We'll always be connected
through our prayers.

That's right.

You just make sure that Joshua
doesn't eat the profits

from the restaurant.

Oh, please.

He won't even be
allowed in the kitchen.

Kelly, are you ready to take

the rest of those
bridesmaids photos?

Oh, sure, sure.
Excuse me.

Sure.

So anyway, Mama.

Look, I'm sorry
Christopher isn't here.

Hey, you know, I wasn't
really expecting him

to come anyway.

You should call him
before you leave to Iowa.

Mama, I don't know.

I just can't.

Okay.

Well, you remember that God
has been blessing you

because of your surrendering
and obedience to him.

Yeah, I know he has.

I know, Mama.

Well, you just love your wife
and live a godly example

before your son.

I promise you I will, Mama.

Okay, okay.

All right.

[phone ringing]

[answering machine beeps]

Christopher,
it's Sarah.

What does she want now?

Pick up the phone,
Christopher.

We need to talk.

Okay, well, we see

you're still good
at not communicating.

Anyway, don't mean
to get in your business,

but I recommend that you settle
your differences between you

and your clients.

[answering machine beeps]

This cannot be
happening to me.

This cannot be
happening to me.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(female operator)
Nine-one-one,
what's your emergency?

Hello?

No, no!

Henry, listen, listen,
listen, can we talk about this,

please?

Please, Henry?

I was always here, wasn't I?

Yes, you were always
here, but not here, Henry.

I told you the stress of
losing my job and the fact

that I can't provide
for my family anymore.

I just can't take it!

But I know God will
provide if you only trust him.

Lucille, you are always
talking about trusting the Lord.

Well, you trust in your God
and feed that extra mouth

I mistakenly has brought
to this house.

But Christopher needs you

and little Joshua needs
a role model in this life.

You can't go, please.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Three twenty-five of
aspirin, two of nitroglycerin.

A total of six
of morphine sulfate.

Eighty-two and regular.

Oxygen sats 99%.

Please, don't go!

Blood pressure
at 92 over 52.

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Hello, Joshua?

What's going on?

It's Christopher.

He's in the hospital.

What?
What happened?

He had a heart attack.

They're stabilizing
him right now.

Can you come see him?

Mama, I can't.

Please?

We're all set up for the
grand opening in a couple days.

Not to mention we're
already half way to Iowa.

Mom, I just--I don't have
that kind of strength.

You're right.

You can't do it all
alone, but through Christ

who strengthens you,
remember?

You can.

I'm sorry, Mama.

All right.

Bye.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

What'd she say?

We're losing him.

I'm clear
and you're clear.

Everybody clear?

(female nurse)
Clear. Clear.

Continue CPR.

Doctor,
he has no pulse.

I'm clear,
you're clear.

Everyone clear?

Clear.

I know this is your lunch
break, but at this office,

keep your faith
and business separate.

My business is my
faith, Mr. Bauman.

May I ask you a question?

If you were to die today,
do you know where you

would spend eternity?

Everybody clear?

Clear.

Why?

'Cause I don't
go to church?

John 3:3 says,
"You must be born again."

And without accepting your
Heavenly Father's free gift

of eternal life, you'll die
and spend eternity in hell.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Please touch him, Lord.

Touch him.

In Jesus' name.

Everybody clear?

Clear.

We got him back.

Let's get vitals.

He's 90 over 50.

That was a close one.

Okay.

Let's see.

No, right here.

Ta-da!

Whew.

Well, Mrs. Kelly, I think
you're going to do really good

with your business.

Thanks.

Except for one
thing I noticed.

What?

You need blinds
on the inside.

Yeah. You think so?

You know anybody?

Stan the blind man.

Aw, that's too bad.
He's blind?

No, no.

No, it just means like
Stan, blind man, blinds.

Oh, it's like the
name of the business?

Yeah, Stan
the man, blind man.

He's not really blind?

No, no, no, no.

Oh, that's cute.

That's catchy,
the blind man.

It's cute.
Cute.

That's a good idea.

Yeah, I should probably
give him a call.

Yeah, I'll call him.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ª Before the world began â™ª

â™ª before our lives
were stained â™ª

â™ª you held us in your plan
to know your grace â™ª

â™ª In the warmth of a sunrise â™ª

â™ª in the sky on lonely nights â™ª

â™ª that's when I realize you
are the Lord of the universe â™ª

â™ª So timeless, your
power invincible â™ª

â™ª Your ways are not my own â™ª

â™ª Your Spirit overflows
right through my soul â™ª

â™ª Oh, timeless, each to
each are still the same â™ª

â™ª Your grace unchanging â™ª

â™ª you sacrifice for
all our stains â™ª

â™ª Oh, timeless â™ª

â™ª Oh, timeless â™ª

â™ª And I travel
down life's road â™ª

â™ª my pain held deep within â™ª

â™ª And searching
this whole world wide â™ª

â™ª just to find
my peace of mind â™ª

â™ª And people just pass me by
like strangers in the night â™ª

â™ª But you are always there â™ª

â™ª your love will never change
as timeless â™ªâ™ª

Yes, ma'am, I will
definitely let him know.

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Everything's closed up
in the back, Mrs. Taylor.

Thank you, Megan.
Have a good night.

Thank you too.
Bye, guys.

Bye, Megan.
Thank you.

Ma'am? Hey, Brandon.

Would you mind turning off
the lights in the back

and be sure
and lock that door?

Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

Well, I have to say you'll
make a mighty fine hot wings

manager, Mr. Taylor.

Well, not as good as your
cooking, Ms. Hot Wing Queen.

Hey, listen, your mom called
and she said that

Christopher is in recovery.

What?

Yeah.

Man, sometimes life
is so unpredictable, huh?

Yeah, but you know what?

God's love never fails.

You know, sometimes
I think I should call him,

but I don't know.

Other times I just don't
want anything to do with him.

Yeah.

You know what?

All we have to do is
just acknowledge God

and he will show us the way.

Yeah, you right.

Thank you, baby.

You're welcome.

So check this out.

What you got?

Listen, just make the call
and make it happen, okay?

And if you need anything,
anything at--

Hey, I'm going to have to call
you back later, okay?

Braxton, I need for you
to make the delivery

to Converse, please.

Yes, ma'am.

Here we go.

Thank you.

I can't wait to get
to the fishing pond, Dad.

Yeah, me too.

I got some of your
mama's hot wing sauce

to put all over the bait.

It'll be all right.

Dad?

Yes, son?

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah, man, shoot.

I know Jesus was
able to walk on water,

but how was Peter able
to do the same thing?

You know, Jesus
said to Peter, "Come."

And with faith, anybody can
accomplish the impossible.

You just have to believe.

You know why Peter
began to sink?

Because he didn't believe?

No, 'cause he took
his eyes off of Jesus.

That's exactly what
happened to me.

You know, I took my eyes
off our Heavenly Father

and I began to look
at all the other stuff

going on around me and my
whole life began to sink.

But then Peter caught
up to Jesus to save him?

Is that what you did also?

Yeah, that's
exactly what I did.

So then it's possible for
you to overcome the pain

Uncle Christopher
caused you, right?

Yeah, man.

You know, I suppose
you're right.

You're a pretty
smart little dude.

I appreciate this time
we get to spend together.

Mom said it'll be this
way between us always.

So long as we keep our
eyes on Jesus, keep our faith,

and endure to
the end, then yeah,

it will always be like this.

Say, you remember that little
road map we used to get here?

Yes, sir.

Well, the Bible is our
road map to get through life.

If you follow that, then
Lord willing, you know,

we're going to
franchise your mom's

hot wing restaurant nationwide.

Sweet, can I help?

Yeah, of course, man.

You're going to be
the chief executive, man.

You already got
the register, right?

I got it.

Cool.

And hey, remember, whatever
the Lord financially

blesses you with--

Tithe 10%.

Right.
You got it, man.

You know what?

If you remain faithful
to the Lord, son,

he will remain faithful to you.

I will, Dad.
I promise.

All right, like father.

Like son.

Yes.

Now let's get some fish.

Hey, Mr. Bauman.

I just have your lunch
tray here for you.

And I'm going to check
your IV real quick.

Good morning, Mr. Bauman.

I'm Dr. Wilburn.

How do you feel?

Okay, I guess.

What happened?

Mr. Bauman, healthy kidneys
clean the blood by removing

excess, fluids,
minerals, and wastes.

When your kidneys fail,
as yours have done,

these things build up in
your body, causing harm.

Your uncontrolled
high blood pressure,

which I suspect over
several years has caused

your kidneys to fail.

When that happened, you got
an increase of potassium in

your blood, causing your heart
to develop an arrhythmia,

which caused it to stop.

You haven't seen a physician
in over 10 years

according to your family.

If you had seen a physician
several months ago,

this may have been prevented.

You have to take better
care of yourself.

What are you saying?

Mr. Bauman, over
the last 2 or 3 days,

we've run various labs
and diagnostic tests on you.

We've come
to the conclusion that

your kidneys have shut down.

Irreversibly.

Mr. Bauman, what I'm
saying to you is this.

You need to be on dialysis
for the rest of your life

or eventually have
a kidney transplant,

which may take several months
or even years to obtain.

This can't be happening.

Mr. Bauman, do you
have any questions?

What do I need to do?

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(male #10)
Can I pick up my order?

Oh yeah.
Hot wings, right here.

All right.

Give that to you
and keep the change.

Oh, thank you, sir.

Congratulations on opening
up the new restaurant.

I hope you have nothing
but continued success.

Hey, thank you, man.
We appreciate it.

We'll see you guys
again soon.

Yeah, and enjoy
Thank you. them hot wings.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Are you ready to order?

"Delight yourself also in
the Lord and he shall give you

"the desires of your heart.

"Commit your way to
the Lord, trust also in him,

"and he shall bring it to pass.

"He shall bring forth your
righteousness as the light

and your justice
as the noonday."

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Mrs. Lucille?

Good morning, this
is Dr. Wilburn.

I wanted to speak to
you about Christopher.

Sure, how is he?

I just saw him today
in the dialysis clinic.

You know, I have to say that
over the last few months,

he's been doing very well.

His blood pressure's
under control,

he's taking better
care of himself,

and one of my cardiology
colleagues recently informed me

that Christopher's heart
is functioning normally.

The good news is a donor
match has been confirmed

for Christopher.

Oh, thank the Lord.

What's required now, doctor?

Only that he receive it.

We want to begin surgery
as soon as possible,

so let's keep our
fingers crossed.

I'd rather cross
my hands in prayer.

Yes, ma'am.

Thank you so much, doctor.

Bye-bye.

Goodbye.

I have some orders for you.

Thank you.

â™ª Silent night â™ª

â™ª Holy night â™ª

â™ª All is calm
all is bright â™ª

â™ª Round yon virgin-- â™ª

Merry Christmas, ma'am.

How are you doing
this evening?

Merry Christmas to you.
I'm doing fine.

My son has been blessed
with a kidney donor match

and I'm here because he's
having transplant surgery.

Oh, what a blessing
on Christmas Eve.

What is his name?

Christopher Bauman.

We will definitely keep him
in prayer for a speedy recovery.

You have a very
Merry Christmas.

Thank you.

You also and you have
a happy New Year.

Thank you.

â™ª Holy night â™ª

â™ª Son of God
love's pure light â™ª

â™ª Radiant beams from
thy holy face â™ª

â™ª with the dawn of
redeeming grace â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

I love you, Lucille.

I love you too, Dad.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Mrs. Lucille?

Good morning.

Good morning, doctor.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

You know, God must
have heard your prayers.

Christopher's transplant
surgery was a success.

Oh, thank the Lord.

And yes, doctor, God does hear
the prayers of his children.

You know, I have to admit,
I've never met anyone that was

so passionate and sincere
about their relationship

with Jesus Christ as you are.

You've been an
encouragement to me.

Well, to God be the glory.

And thank you, doctor, for
everything that you've done.

My pleasure.

Christopher's doing well
and resting in recovery.

You can see him shortly.

Okay. Okay.

You're welcome.
Thank you so much.

And God bless you, doctor.

God bless you also.

Mr. Ramone, how
are you this morning?

Merry Christmas,
Mr. Ramone.

Hey, what's so
merry about it?

It's just another day.

It's a holy holiday.

It's something
to be happy about.

Well, anyway, did you
enjoy your morning stroll?

No.

Good morning.

I'm here to see
Christopher Bauman.

I'm Sarah Bauman.

Oh, yes, your mother-in-law
said you might be stopping by.

Your husband's in room 117, but
the doctors want him resting

for a few more hours.

Oh, okay.

Well, do you mind if I
leave a note for him?

Thank you. Sure.

There you go.

Your husband's room is right
down that hallway to the left.

Okay, thank you.

Mm-hmm.

(female on intercom)
Dr. Codrey, please
dial extension 5-1-1-7.

Dr. Codrey, 5-1-1-7.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Dear Christopher,
Merry Christmas.

I'm glad to know
you're recovering well.

Your mother showed me
a Scripture that read,

"With God, all things
are possible."

Christopher, I do believe all
things are possible with God,

including our marriage.

Can we talk?

Please get well soon.

Willing to forgive, Sarah.

[knocking on door]

Knock, knock.

Merry Christmas, son.

Hi, Mom.

Merry Christmas to you too.

How do you feel?

Just tired.

But I don't remember anything.

Well, you just remember
this, God has blessed you

with a donated kidney.

That is a great
Christmas present.

I'd say it makes for
an amazing Christmas gift,

Christopher.

Thanks, doc.

Don't thank me,
thank your mom.

I truly believe that if it had
not been for her strong faith

and prayers, your situation
would have turned out

for the worse.

(male #11)
All rise for
the Honorable Judge King.

Thank you.
You may be seated.

Thank you.

Divorce court 1023,
case number 1001,

Sarah Bauman versus
Christopher Bauman.

Are you the attorney
representing Sarah Bauman?

Yes, Your Honor.

Where's your client?

Well, Your Honor,
I'm not certain.

I've represented many families
going through what I now realize

to be a tragedy and never
thought for more than a moment

the harm that
perhaps I've caused.

So yesterday, as I sat
down with my client,

I gave her different
words, living Words.

I shared with her
this Scripture.

It says that tribulation
produces perseverance,

and perseverance character,
and character hope,

and now hope does
not disappoint.

Okay, one moment.

This is not church.

This is a court of law.

What does this Scripture
has to do with this case?

Your Honor,
if I may continue?

(Judge King)
All right, go ahead.

I understand this is not
church and I'm not a preacher,

but this is a place of justice
and justice is found

in these living Words.

This Scripture says that
the reason that you see so many

cases and that I work so many
cases is because our marriages

in this society have no hope
because they have no character.

And today, true justice
is through hope.

And just as this Scripture says
that hope will not disappoint,

today my client receives
hope and she understands,

just as perhaps many of
the marriages that are

hanging on by the last thread
need to understand,

that it's not time
to run from our problems,

but to run through our
problems and to persevere.

Divorce doesn't fix things,
it doesn't solve problems.

Love is the answer.

Today, my client is
in the right place.

(Judge King)
And where's this?

At home where she belongs
because she's heard

this living Word that
perseverance gives character

and character hope.

Well, I can see your client
obviously found the hope

that she was looking
for 'cause she's not here.

So the case resets
6 months from today.

How do you feel?

Better.
Much better.

Good, good.

It's been over a week
Yes. now since the surgery.

You'll be ready to leave
the hospital very soon.

Oh, by the way, you asked
about the kidney donor?

Mr. Taylor is already recovering
back home very nicely.

Taylor?

Mr. Joshua Taylor from,
I believe, Lancaster, Iowa?

There must be some mistake.

No mistake, ma'am.

Is there a problem?

Yes.
That's my son.

I can't believe that he--

Excuse me.

Mrs. Lucille, we've just
received some news from

the doctor taking care of
your son back home in Iowa,

Joshua Taylor.

Apparently he
was recovering back home

and collapsed apparently
from a brain aneurysm.

No one knew about it.

I'm so sorry, ma'am.

He didn't make it.


â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

That can't be!

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

It is an amazing thing that
life should be punctuated

by moments such as these.

Today we're here to honor
and to remember

our loved one,
Joshua Taylor.

He was a young man whom some
of us might have thought

would have a long life
ahead of him.

And yet today we are reminded
that life--

The Bible also makes it clear

that we are by
nature children of wrath.

Hell is our destiny
unless someone--

Joshua Taylor discovered
to his great benefit

that the only way
that he could go to heaven

was through
faith in Christ alone.

Do you know that Jesus came
to this world to die for you?

He didn't just come
to be an example,

he came to be the lamb of God
who takes away

the sin of the world.

He came specifically to be
our redeeming sacrifice,

paying for our debt, making
possible our salvation

if we will but receive him
as our Lord and our Savior.

Why?

Because he wanted to make it
possible to everybody who is

within the sound of my voice,
he wanted to make it possible

for you to be able to avoid hell
and to have an eternal presence

with our God in heaven.

Sister Lucille,
you raised him well.

Joshua's in glory now.

Thank you Pastor.

God bless you,
my sister.

Thank you.

God bless you,
my brother.

Thank you.

Please accept
my condolences.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Joey?

Joanna.

Joanna Perkins.

You have my
deepest condolences.

Thank you.

You look so good.

Well, it's only
because of you.

At the restaurant,
you spoke truth to me.

I was seeking peace,
love, and understanding,

and I never found it.

But when I accepted my
Heavenly Father's love,

he changed my life.

I now work with young girls
and women young and old

to help them find their
true identity in Christ.

Keep encouraging others.

I am so proud of you.

Hello, Kelly.

I know he loved you.

I am so sorry we had to meet
for the very first time

under these circumstances.

That's okay.

You know, I believe
that God has a reason

for all the things that happen.

That's how I get through
things like this.

Have you met your
nephew, Brandon?

Hello.

Brandon.

Your father was a very unselfish
man to have sacrificed his life

for me so that I may live.

So that you might live
a temporary, physical life.

But you know, there's somebody
who sacrificed his life

so that you can live
eternally with him.

His name is Jesus.

Do you know him,
Christopher?

You know, Joshua didn't know
the outcome of his operation,

but he wrote you a letter
before he went into surgery.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ª Tell me what kind. â™ª

â™ª Holy Ghost
to have you away â™ª

â™ª Thank you, Jesus,
for your undying love â™ª

â™ª your unconditional love
your agape love â™ª

â™ª For God so loved the world â™ª

â™ª that he gave his
only begotten Son â™ª

â™ª What kind of love is this
that would die for me â™ª

â™ª lay down his life to the point
of being crucified for me? â™ª

â™ª What kind,
what kind of love? â™ª

â™ª What kind of love is this
that makes the dead arise â™ª

â™ª makes the dead to walk
and opens blinded eyes? â™ª

â™ª What kind of love? â™ªâ™ª

Christopher, if you're
reading this letter,

then it's definite
that I have passed on.

When I left Seguin
with my family,

I must admit I was filled
with bitterness towards you

and hadn't yet learned
to love unconditionally.

But God, through his Word,
touched my heart

and moved me to forgive.

From childhood, we both were
without an earthly dad

in our lives, but I must
tell you Christopher,

when I accepted
Jesus as my Savior,

I met my Heavenly Father.

He changed my life.

Let him change yours.

Remember, there's only
one of two roads to be on,

the road to heaven
or the road to hell.

Pray, repent, and open
your heart to God.

And don't wait,
Christopher.

I'm in heaven now
and I hope to see you here.

In glory, your brother,
Joshua Taylor.

Joshua.

Without accepting your
Heavenly Father's free gift

of eternal life, you'll die
and spend eternity in hell.

And you can't
forget about God.

Look at your family
right now.

You're a hypocrite.

Do you believe
in Jesus now?

Yeah, I do.

â™ª It's the love of the Son â™ª

â™ª it's the love of the Spirit â™ª

â™ª the love of three
in one, one. â™ª

â™ª That's my, that's
my kind of love â™ª

â™ª It's the love
without measure â™ª

â™ª the kind of love
you can treasure â™ª

â™ª the kind of love that
shared its breath â™ª

â™ª so we could reign
with him forever â™ª

Do you know why Jesus came
to this world to die for you?

He came specifically to be
our redeeming sacrifice,

paying for our debt, making
possible our salvation

if we will but receive him
as our Lord and our Savior.

He wanted to make it
possible for you

to be able to avoid hell

and to have an eternal presence
with our God in heaven.

Oh, Lord.

Forgive me, Father.

â™ª What kind
of love is this? â™ª

â™ª Forgive all sin
erase all debt â™ª

â™ª and make me whole again â™ª

â™ª What kind, tell me
what kind of love? â™ªâ™ª

Oh, Lord.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ª Lord, I come today â™ª

â™ª On my knees I pray â™ª

â™ª Please forgive me â™ª

â™ª Guide and lead me â™ª

No more addictions.

â™ª Will you mend my heart â™ª

â™ª that has come apart? â™ª

â™ª Lord, please heal me â™ª

â™ª Can you hear me? â™ª

â™ª Every part of me needs
every part of you â™ª

â™ª I'm blinded by my tears
and shackled by my fears â™ª

â™ª My Prince of Peace
help me tonight â™ª

â™ª and let me see your light â™ª

â™ª I can't go on this way â™ª

â™ª Your grace I need each day â™ª

â™ª Lord, I'm falling â™ª

â™ª Hear me calling â™ª

â™ª Calling out to you â™ª

â™ª The way,
the light, the truth â™ª

â™ª The forgiver, â™ª

â™ª the life giver, yeah â™ª

â™ª Every part of me needs
every part of you â™ª

â™ª I'm blinded by my tears
and shackled by my fears â™ª

â™ª My Prince of Peace
help me tonight â™ª

â™ª and let me see your light â™ª

Your mother told
me you might be here.

I wouldn't blame you if
you hated me, Christopher.

I abandoned you,
Joshua, and your mother.

I should've trusted God.

And I didn't.

And I'm sorry.

Now I'm asking for
your forgiveness.

You know, Dad, ever since I
have accepted Jesus as my savior

and I've been studying God's
Word, I know about forgiveness.

And that peace that
Joshua had, I now have.

So although you were gone, God,
my true Father, was present.

Dad, I've already
forgiven you.

I love you, Dad.

I love you too, son.

â™ª Oh, I want
to see your light, oh â™ª

â™ª Help me now â™ª

â™ª My Prince of Peace
help me tonight â™ª

â™ª And let me see your light â™ªâ™ª


Well, congratulations,
Mr. Butler,

on the purchase of your
fifth hot wing franchise.

Well, thank you very much.

It's been a real pleasure
doing business

with you and Ms. Taylor
and God willing,

I hope we do a lot more
business in the future.

Thank you, sir.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Good to meet you.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Thanks for having
me over this summer.

Any time, baby, any time.

Grandma, why would
God allow this to happen?

I mean,
to take my dad away?

Brandon,
God is sovereign.

Oftentimes, we don't understand
the tragic things that happen

in life, but God is
still in control.

But we were
becoming so close.

I know how you feel.

I've been there too.

Daddy, where are you?

Where are you, Daddy?

But then, one day, I
found the love of God.

He has filled my heart
with peace and joy

that can't be explained.

Is that how you and my mom
are able to be so calm

when things around you
are not?

Yes, it is.

Well, if that's the kind of
contentment that one can have

from God, I want to have
that peace and joy also.

Oh, really?

no condemnations in life â™ª

â™ª and I've been forgiven
yeah â™ª

â™ª Yo, put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª put your hands up â™ª

â™ª Yo, put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª Oh, duh â™ª

â™ª Yo, we've been
forgiven, all right â™ª

â™ª And if you in the place
just raise your hands â™ª

â™ª You know this can't stop
this is the soul train â™ª

â™ª You know
as Christ's reigns â™ª

â™ª its beat is the same â™ª

â™ª If you want, man, you
can get up and dance â™ª

â™ª You've been forgiven, yeah
and we got another chance â™ª

â™ª Seeing how Christ
built my man â™ª

â™ª 'cause he rose for my sins â™ª

â™ª that's a thrill, my man â™ª

â™ª So I spit it so clear, brother
in the front or the rear â™ª

â™ª I can see ya â™ª

â™ª Just to let you know
that Christ cares â™ª

â™ª He got the living water
let go, what with them beers â™ª

â™ª And just chill for
a new beginning â™ª

â™ª one full of life and free
from all the sinning â™ª

â™ª Christ is like Mike
'cause I'm winning â™ª

â™ª I've been forgiven â™ª

â™ª that's what I've been given â™ª

â™ª I have been forgiven â™ª

â™ª Jesus came and put
this smile on my face â™ª

â™ª And even though I
don't deserve it, no â™ª

â™ª Turn my mourning into dancing
and I sure am thankful â™ª

â™ª Put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª Put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª Put your hands up
put your hands up â™ª

â™ª put your hands up
in the air â™ª

â™ª and say thank you â™ªâ™ª
