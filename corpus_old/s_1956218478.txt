(RADIO TUNING)

DWIGHT EISENHOWER:
<i>Soldiers, sailors and airmen</i>

<i>of the Allied Expeditionary
Force,</i>

<i>you are about to embark
upon the Great Crusade.</i>

<i>You will bring about
the destruction</i>

<i>of the German war machine.</i>

<i>The elimination

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

TIBBET: Hitler's already dead.

Short train ride
from Paris to Berlin,

and I get there
with this baby...

Pow!

We all go home.

(PARATROOPERS CHATTING
INDISTINCTLY)

ROSENFELD:
That's a lot of boats!

I think I'd rather be up here.

Some Kraut bomber spots them

all squeezed together
like that,

take out 20 at a time.

Tougher to shoot down
a plane.

TIBBET: Hey, Rosenfeld!

More GIs die in planes
than boats. That's a fact.

(ALL EXCLAIM)

Don't listen to Tibbet, Rosenfeld.
He's full of shit.

Hey, Grunauer!

How do you say "full of shit"
in German again?

(TRANSLATES TO GERMAN)


DAWSON: (LAUGHS) I love that.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

Hey.

Morton Chase.

I'm a photographer.

I heard the Sergeant say that
you were in Italy before this?

It's a great frame.
You mind if I snap

a couple pictures of you
looking out the window?

You know what I wouldn't mind,
Morton Chase,

is you taking your ass
back to your seat.

(TIBBET EXCLAIMS)

TIBBET: You making friends
already, pretty boy?

You know that guy?
No.

MURPHY: Corporal
from Baker Company.

Last minute transfer.

I heard he got put in with us
for popping a captain.

NEZ: He pops his C.O.
and gets a ride with us, huh?

So, what did we do wrong?
(LAUGHTER)

Uh, Boyce. Gum?

What the fuck is this?
What's this, for luck?

Come on, man.

Shit, you're gonna need
more than that

when we hit the ground.

Can you give me
my chain, please?

Ain't gonna be nothing
like boot camp,

not with those Jerries
firing real ammo.

And, hell, Boyce, you hardly
made it out of boot alive.

No lucky charm in the world

is gonna turn you
into a soldier.

Are you finished?

Are you gonna give me
the fucking chain?

I'm screwing with you.
Thanks.

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

Where's our drop zone, Nez?

The village of Cielblanc,
France, Sergeant!

And what is our target,
Grunauer?

Radio-jamming tower
on top of the church

near the town center,
Sergeant!

And why would the Nazis
put a radio-jamming tower

on top of a church,
Private Boyce?

Because they...

Good Christ Almighty, Boyce.

They put it
on a church because

the Nazis are
rotten sons of bitches.

And rotten sons of bitches
will do anything they have to

to destroy everything
that is good in this world!

That is why we have to be
just as rotten as they are.


PARATROOPERS: Yes, Sergeant!

There are gonna be over
120,000 Allied soldiers

fighting their way
onto a French beach

in the name
of all that is good

and pure in this world.

Those men are gonna need
air support!

That support will not make it
through Jerry's defenses

if we do not get
that tower down by 0600.

So what do you have to do?

PARATROOPERS:
Our goddamn job, Sergeant!

That's right.

Your goddamn job.

Corporal Ford here has joined
as our explosives expert.

You are lucky to have him.

You will obey his commands
as if you heard

my own beautiful voice
coming from his lips.

Our drop is 90 minutes out.

Coo-ree!
PARATROOPERS: Coo-ree!

(PARATROOPER COUGHS)

(RUMBLING CONTINUES)


(HURRIED CHATTER)

(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)
(GRUNTS)

We must be
getting close.

Hope nothing goes wrong.

We miss our drop and land

in the middle of
a German squad or something...

Nothing's gonna go wrong.

Because we both know
what the Nazis

are gonna do to a guy
named Rosenfeld.

Nothing's gonna go wrong.
(EXPLOSION)

(AIRCRAFT RUMBLING)

It's just a little
Kraut hello, ladies.

Hold your seat and stay calm.

We jump
when the light tells us.

(PANICKED CHATTER AND SHOUTS)

(RUMBLING)
Isn't this fun, ladies?


(PANICKED CHATTER)

Oh, shit!

NAVIGATOR: Too much flak!

We're gonna have to drop
a couple of clicks south.

RENSIN: Copy that.

(ENGINE ROARING)

(SOLDIERS YELLING)

RENSIN: Didn't I tell you,
ladies,

I'd show you a good time?


(ALL CLAMORING)

MURPHY:
We're gonna fucking die!

We're gonna fucking die!

Sarge, you got...

Murphy!
DAWSON: Medic!

RENSIN: Settle down!
This is why we're here.

This is the job.

FORD: Grunauer, sit down!

Goddamn it, sit down!

I can save him!
I can save him!

He's dead! Sit down!
Everybody sit down!

(WEAPON WHIZZES)

(PARATROOPERS SCREAMING)

Oh, shit!

(BELL RINGS)

Red level! Stand up.

Hook up.

Square up that line!

Wait for green.

Oh, shit. (HUFFS)

I'll be right behind you.

I'll be right behind you.
Okay.

(SOLDIERS CHATTING

Shut up. It's over.

You just let him die.

He was dead
before he hit the ground.

He fucking knew that.

What are you talking about?
We could've...

Done shit.

There were ten of them,

and I've seen how you hold
that rifle.

The Sergeant
wasn't the mission.

We got to get that tower down
by 0600. Let's go.

Another click north,

we reach the rally point
at Cielblanc.

That's if the others
even made it.

Did you see anyone?
No, just you.

And Sergeant Rensin.

Boyce, you keep worrying
about dead bodies,

you're gonna be one.

Well, Corporal, I had
friends on that plane.

Yeah.

Well, friends die.

Corporal.
(TWIG SNAPS)


TIBBET: (WHISPERS) Flash.

Thunder.

(TONGUE CLICKS)


TIBBET: Welcome to France.

Hey, fellas!

Shh.
DAWSON: (SOFTLY) Oh, sorry.

I was afraid it was just
gonna be us three. (CHUCKLES)

He was afraid.

I was about to end it
if I had to listen

to Annie Oakley over here
for another minute.

FORD: Tibbet, how you doing
on explosives?

I'm good.

Please tell me you got more
than just Boyce with you.

Goddamn it. Sorry.

You got your camera.
Oh, jeez. Huh?

You brought your camera.
Yes.

That made the jump?
Yeah.

Wow, that's well-made.

Thank you.
You get scenic shots with it?

Uh, well, I think

they want me to take
some more of the action,

maybe get some scenes
from the frontline.

Can I see that?
I can use that.

Just be careful with this.
You know, it's a fragile...

(CAMERA SHATTERS)
It's like wearing a spotlight around your neck.

Sorry, man.

Any sign of Rosenfeld?

DAWSON: Saw Grunauer
about a mile east.

The Krauts had shot him
all to hell.

TIBBET: Shit. Not gonna be
nobody left to rally with.

FORD: Just keep smiling
through it, Tibbet.

TIBBET: Fuck France.

I bet you wish you were back
at Italy, huh, Corporal?

How'd you even end up
with us?

I don't know, Tibbet.

Why do you talk so much?

Some questions
don't have good answers.

in my book, Corporal Ford.

Your book?

Yeah. I've been writing it
since we got stationed.

TIBBET: Is that what you're
always scribbling about?

Jesus, Dawson, I didn't
think a hick like you

knew enough letters
to make a sentence,

much less a fucking book.

My mama writes her cookbooks
for the church back home.

I figured
I'd try it over here.

All the stuff regular folks
don't know.

What goes on
from basic to here.

Sounds thrilling. Bet you'll
sell a million copies.

I'd buy one.

Thanks, buddy.

And, Chase, I was thinking
maybe me and you

could team up, use some
of your pictures in it.

That way, you get a cut
of the profits...

(METAL CLICKS)

FORD: (MUFFLED) Boyce!

Boyce, walk on a line to me!

Boyce!


Where's Dawson?

Where's Dawson?
FORD: There is no Dawson.

Walk to me on a line like
you're on a fucking tightrope.

Fix your bayonet

and probe to my line.


Come on. We got to go!

(BOYCE COUGHING)

Chase,
get right on his tracks.

Move it, keep coming.

(BOYCE GRUNTING)


Hey, hey, hey, get up.
Point your weapon that way.

Anyone want to come
over here and get me?

Use your rifle.
Light taps.

Not hard enough
to set off a mine.

Exactly how hard
is too hard?

You'll know.

Move it. We need to get
to the tree line.

He was there

and then he wasn't.

But you still are.

So get your head right.
We got a job to do.

TIBBET:
What the hell is this?

CHASE: A dog, maybe?

TIBBET: Oh. Smells like shit.

CHASE: What is that on it?
TIBBET: Looks like an eyeball.

CHASE: That's not normal.

FORD: Hey, turn off
the fucking light.

Jesus, sorry.

Goddamn it, doesn't matter
what it...

What it is.

TIBBET: That's not a dog.

CHASE: Kind of looks
like a jackal.

TIBBET: A jackal?
Yeah, you know, Satan's dogs?

Patrol hell.

Rip the spirit
right out of your body

and take it straight
to the devil.

Where do you come up
with this shit?

What do you mean?

TIBBET: How do these things
pop into your head?

CHASE: The Bible.

TIBBET: The Bible.

How many jackals
have you seen with a hoof?

CHASE: That's exactly
my point.

This is not
your average jackal.

BOYCE: Hey! (SHUSHING)



BOYCE: Corporal,
what do we do?

FORD: She can't let anyone
know we're here.

Grab her. Grab her.


(GRUNTS)
(BOYCE GRUNTS)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Easy. Easy, easy. Easy.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Boyce, official translator.
All right.

Our girl's a scavenger.

FORD: Cielblanc?
Is that your village?

Cielblanc?

Germans? Many Germans?

(TIBBET CHUCKLES)

Here.

Boyce, tell her
to lead the way.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) This?

Here.

(WOMAN WHISPERS IN FRENCH)

TIBBET: Fucking Nazis.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH)
Corporal? This is it.

What are we gonna find
in there?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Just an
aunt and kid brother.

Okay. We're gonna find out
if she's telling the truth.

Boyce, you stay here.

If she runs, shoot her.

Let's go.

I needed to make sure
you weren't as well.

This way.

that's beautiful.

<i>Ooh la la la. Oui, oui.</i>
Oh, you know,

we go to Eiffel Tower and all that shit.

(MUFFLED WHEEZING

(CHLOE SPEAKING FRENCH)

No.

She's very sick.

<i>Bonjour.</i>

(SOLDIER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
(VEHICLE PASSING)

TIBBET: A lot of Krauts
moving around out there.

Two buzzsaws by my count.

And that wall
is well fortified, too.

Everybody de-rig.

All the explosives and timers
on this table,

and I need a count.

Ma'am.

Have you been inside
that compound?

No.

The trucks go in and out,

but we are shot
if we go near it.

We'll have to clock their
patrols and scale it in a gap.

TIBBET: Oh, and hope that
there's not a firing squad

waiting for us
behind that wall?

FORD: We just need
enough time to place

the explosives on that tower.

Tibbet, if we could put you
in a good position,

you think you could keep
those buzzsaws off

Chase and I if they see us
dropping over?

Wait, what?

TIBBET: I mean, I can
buy you some time,

but once I start popping,
they're gonna be coming out

of every door.
I can't cover that.

Well, what if I...

I'm not sure that I'm the best
person to climb the tower.

BOYCE: Maybe I could go.
(LOUD CRASHING)

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

What they've done to so many.

(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

Oh, shit!
TIBBET: Jesus Christ.

CHLOE: You can't stay here.

They patrol all night,
inspecting houses,

doing whatever they like.

We just need to stay here
till that tower comes down

in less than four hours.

TIBBET:
Don't worry, sweetheart.

Oh, Jesus!

We got to put a bell on this
little fucker, or something.

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

soldiers out there

and there's only four of us.

So,

maybe we should wait.

See if more of our guys
show up first.

Pretty boy, you finally said
something smart.

Thank you.
Corporal, there is no sense

committing suicide
over some tower.

We all heard the Sergeant.

The planes can't provide
air support

to the beaches unless
we take the tower out.

TIBBET: Oh, listen to you!
Right?

TIBBET: All of a sudden

talking like a real soldier
there, Boyce.

And what are you prepared to
do to take out those Krauts?

Whatever I have to.

Whatever you have to.

And what is that exactly?
Tell me more.

What's your point, Tibbet?

My point is you couldn't
even kill a mouse,

could you?

Corporal, you've got to
hear this.

We had this mouse, he
gets in the barracks

back at base, right?

The thing's shitting
all over the place,

so Sarge, he orders
somebody to kill it.

So Boyce here,
he catches the thing

in his boot and he sets it
loose in a field.

But the mouse comes back
the next night,

and it's crapping all over
Sarge's pillow.

So Sarge, he has us
running up hills

all morning for that shit.

You're not built
for this, Boyce.

Even if you were, there's
10 Krauts to every one of us.

Tibbet, enough!

And go see if anyone else
made it to the rally point.

Take Chase with you.
Oh, goddamn it.

Chase, go. And be back here
at 0300.

(BOY SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) What?
(CONTINUES IN FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) What?

(CONTINUES IN FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH)
It's all pops and clicks.

I don't understand
what you're saying.

He asked if
you wanted to play.

He thinks all Americans
play baseball.

Yeah, well, not this one.

Tell him to get a pool cue
and five bucks

and we'll be in business.

Chase, move it!

FORD: Ma'am?

Thank you.

I need you to go downstairs and
make sure everything stays clear.

Right, but Tibbet and Chase,
they probably need a little...

Boyce, go.

(WOMAN COUGHING)


(WHEEZING CONTINUES)

(DOOR CREAKING SOFTLY)





I told you my aunt was sick.
(GASPS)

What happened to her?

I don't know.

Ask the Germans.

She hasn't spoken since I
got her back from the church.

I need to clean that.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Let's go!

I liked the story
about the mouse.

Your English is good.

CHLOE: I went
to university in London

to be a veterinarian.

Then the war came,

and everything changed.

That's Paul.

And I'm Chloe.

BOYCE: I'm Ed.

(WATER RUNNING)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Your French

My grandmother taught me.
She was from Haiti.

But she moved to the States.
She was in Louisiana.

I don't know Louisiana.

It's hot. (CHUCKLES)

It's hot.

CHLOE: And, um,

there is no war there?

Not like this.

You said before that, um,

the Germans, they took
your parents?

Our father first.

A few weeks later
they come for our mother.


he believes the tar
in the ground

has some kind of a power.


He calls it his science.

for hitting

(SPEAKING GERMAN)


(LIGHTER CAP CLICKS)

(ROSENFELD GROANS)

What happened to him?

I found him
inside the church.

Krauts grabbed me
as soon as I hit the ground.

Woke up with all kinds of
shit stuck in me.

Inside the church? How did
you get inside the church?

On dead bodies.

Slow down. Slow down.

Listen to me. They're doing
experiments on them in there.

They're doing experiments
on the villagers!

What?
Just like her aunt.

They're burning people
with these flamethrowers,

and they're still moving,
the bodies...

And they're pumping tar
from the ground

into these cocoon things...

Breathe. Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

She doesn't have a body

and she's still talking,
and I saw Rosenfeld...

Boyce!
(GASPS)

Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

(PANTING HEAVILY)

(STAMMERS) The tower base...

...is below the ground.

But there's more than that

What is this shit?

(SPEAKS GERMAN)

Oh, you don't?
No.

burn those people.


This is war, <i>ja?</i>

(FORD SCOFFS)

I'm sure your

many people.

(WAFNER GROANS)


Oh, yeah. Hey.

Stay focused.

I'm on the clock here, Franz,

so if you don't tell me
what I need to know,

the private here is gonna
paint this room with you.


What do you do
with those people

that you take
into that church?

They have been given
a purpose.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Get her off!

Get her the fuck

we don't need this

because it's got nothing

Fuck you.


(WAFNER SCREAMING)


Get him up.

Hoist him up.

What?
FORD: Hoist him up.

<i>Nein. Nein.</i>

Corporal, why do we need
to hoist him up for?

We know he's not gonna talk.
You said we have to move.

We have a mission, right?

Right?

What's inside that

Men, weapons, everything.

Hmm?

I'm gonna win this one.

You're gonna fucking talk.
You're gonna fucking talk.


Ford!

What?
What the hell are we doing?

You think this asshole
deserves better?

We're not him!

You want to beat them,

you play just as dirty
as they do.

Now get the fuck back.

How many men you have
behind that wall?

(GRUNTS)
(BLOOD SPLATTERING)

How many troops
inside that compound?

(WAFNER GROANS)

Get the fuck out of here.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH)
Three months ago, I was

cutting grass
in my front yard

and the mailman shows up
with a letter from the Army.

Now I'm here.

With no idea of where
I'm gonna end up.


(WATER RUNNING)
FORD: If we can believe him,

they got at least
40 men inside the wall.

definitely that's too many.

Right? It's too many.

It'll make it tough
to slip by.

Tibbet'll have to keep them
busy long enough

for you and me
to rig that tower.

You still going
with that plan?

It's all we got.

BOYCE: You know,
there might be access

to the tower from inside.

I mean, I saw some kind of
operations room

when I was down there.

So we gotta fight our way
into the church

and then
fight our way out? No.

It's better to stay outside.

Sixty minutes until
they hit the beach.

You got a vehicle we can use?
You won't get it back.

My father kept one
in the garage.

Chase, go get the Kraut
ready to travel.

We're gonna use him
to draw a crowd.

Show me this garage.

Hey. Time to move.

Hey. Fella.

Wake up.

I think I'm gonna need
some help...

No! No! Stop it! Stop!
Let go! No!

Help!

BOYCE: Chase!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

CHLOE:
Hey, hey, hey.

Chase, Chase, Chase.

CHASE:
He was asleep.

He was asleep.

Goddamn it.

TIBBET: Shut up.
It's not your fault.

Put pressure on it.
Yeah, put pressure.

Is it bad? Is it bad?

Shh. Just look at me.
You're fine. You're fine.

How's he doing?
BOYCE: Chase.

Open your mouth, huh.
There you go.

Hey, Ed?
Don't let me die, okay?

You're not gonna die.
You're all right.

You're all right.

(CHASE WHEEZING)
FORD: Pressure, put pressure.

Come on, Chase.
It's gonna be okay, son.

I don't feel good.

CHLOE: Stay down, stay down.
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

Chase, relax, relax, relax.

You're all right.
(WHEEZING)

You're all right, Chase.
Just stay with us.

Look at me, Chase,
look at me.

BOYCE: Chase. Chase.

CHASE:
Where's my camera?

It's right here.

It's your camera.


BOYCE: Chase.

Chase.

(WHEEZES DEEPLY)

Chase.

Let me put a bullet
in his fat Kraut face!

FORD: No, no, no, no,
we still need him.

I'll get you another one!

What are you doing?

Boyce, he's dead.

Rosenfeld, get these explosives
off the table. We need to move.

If they haven't heard us
by now, they just did.

Move it!

Keep moving. Move!

FORD: Boyce, explosives, now.

Come on. Air support
can't cover that beach

as long as that tower's
still up.

TIBBET: What are you
smiling at, buddy?


(CONTINUES WHEEZING)

Holy Christ.

Uh...

You asked what the
serum was, Corporal.

I'm thirsty.

How do you...
How do you feel?


I feel really good.

Doesn't even hurt.

as it looks, I guess.

That's weird.

Add it to the list.

Chase?
Huh?

Can you stand up?

Yeah.

TIBBET: Whoa, whoa. Easy.


Is it hot in here?

(CLOTH RIPS)
I feel hot.

(GRUNTS, EXHALES)

Chase.
Chase.

Maybe you should sit down.
My head hurts.

What the fuck?

Ed?

Chase?
Oh, my God.


Shit.
TIBBET: Jesus.


(ALL GASP)
Whoa, Chase.

Chase, sit down.

TIBBET: Jesus Christ, Chase!
Jesus Christ!


What's wrong with him?

I don't know.

(GRUNTS)
(NECK SNAPS)

(ALL EXCLAIM)


FORD: Chase.


(BONE CRACKS)

FORD: I'm gonna
fucking shoot him.

BOYCE: Corporal,
no, please.

Corporal, relax, please.
Chase.

Hey, pal.

Hey, Chase?

What did you do to me, Ed?


What did you do?
Chase, stop!


What just happened?

A Thousand-Year Reich

needs thousand-year soldiers.

(CHASE WHEEZING)

You got to be
shitting me.


Boyce.

Boyce!

Hey. Hey.
It's over. It's over!

It's over! It wasn't him.
That was not Chase.

You hear me? It wasn't Chase.

Holy shit.

Does somebody want to tell me

what the fuck
is going on here?

PAUL: (SCREAMING) Chloe!

Fuck!

CHLOE: Paul!

FORD: Damn it!

We got to move. We take down
that tower right now.

Boyce, you and I are
climbing it.

Tibbet and Rosenfeld
will cover us.

BOYCE: Corporal, wait,
what about the kid?

Come on, we got to move!
Goddamn it!

They grabbed him
because of us. Wait, wait.

And the labs? The shit
they're doing down there?

That doesn't matter!
They're not our mission.

We take out the tower,
troops come in

and deal with whatever's
below ground later.

Her brother will be dead
by then.

FORD: You forget
what your job is, Private?

It's about more than
that now, Corporal!

Do I have to drag your ass
up that fucking tower?

Yes, you do. Because I'm not
leaving him down there.

I gave you an order!

No.

No.

No. No!

We have to do this!

You know we have to do this,
Corporal.

I can get us inside.

I can. I can get us inside!

We can blow the tower
from below.

We can destroy
their fucking labs!

We could grab the kid
as a bonus. Kill two birds.



If we do this,

our odds of walking
out of here

go down to nearly zero.

TIBBET: If we pull it off,
that walk back's

gonna feel a hell
of a lot sweeter.

And I can lead us
straight there.

Okay.

Tell me while we move.

BOYCE: There's an old drainage
line just east of the church.

The tunnel entrance
is down the slope.

Right.
And over here is the church.

Make sure you can
cover that entrance.

Here should give you
a good angle

on our bait
and those two buzzsaws.

You got to keep those
from getting wound up.

Be nice to have a friend to
keep any loose Krauts off me.

ROSENFELD: Yeah, I can cover
him while Boyce sneaks you in.

Okay.

You got to make sure
it feels like

the entire 101st is
laying down on them.

We need to pull as
many outside as we can.

The more they're bunched up
for us, the better.

I'll take care of that.
And be careful.

Gonna catch on at some
point it's just two guys.

Just buy us enough time down
below to get the ordnance set.

Then we'll rescue the kid.

I think we can manage that.
Yeah.

Good luck.

You keep your head down.

You too, Ed.
Yeah.

Hey.

Woulda made a hell
of a chapter

in Dawson's book, huh?

What about Paul?

We rig this place,

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

TIBBET: Ford?

You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,

but you went below
to set the charges.

BOYCE: Yes, sir.

Why would you do something
like that, Private?

Corporal Ford thought
it was best.

The number of
enemy troops, he...

He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.

Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.

I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.

So do I, sir.

Go catch a breath.

We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.

At ease, Private.

Oh, Private?

Did you see anything else
when you were down there?

There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.

So if there's anything
down there

that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,

you'd let us know, right?

Just the tower control room.

But there's nothing
left of that, sir.

That's what I figured.

Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.

Thank you, sir.

TIBBET: No wilds.

Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.

Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.

You look better.
ROSENFELD: Thanks.

Now I just got to
convince somebody

how I helped save the war.

TIBBET: Save the war?
All I saw was you missing

a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.

ROSENFELD: Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.

TIBBET: Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.

Do you remember that?

No? That's what I thought.

Did you get your orders?

Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.

Jesus Christ,
after all that?

I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.

Got a job to finish.

We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.

And then pop!

We all go home.
