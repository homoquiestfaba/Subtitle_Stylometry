Just me, Ana. Just me.

Reporter: <i>Please,
stay tuned for further updates</i>

The National Weather has...</i>

Dimitri: Sorry.
Reporter: <i>...just issued</i>

for all areas.</i>

<i>This is an emergency.</i>

(knock on window)
Reporter: <i>Severe storm</i>

Significant flooding expected.</i>

<i>Floodwaters are usually deeper

<i>Proceed with caution.</i>
Turn it back.

You're gonna kill the battery.

I'd like to know what's coming.

Dimitri: Mm-hmm.
Reporter: <i>...per hour.</i>

<i>And now, the area's forecast

No more nights in the car, Ana.

Mm-hmm.

We'll find you someplace better.

Reporter:

(radio continues playing)

'Kay? It's time.
(bird chirping)

Trunk?
They're letting you play?

Shift's over.
I'm the talent now.

Rock star.

Still need a singer.
Don't look at me.

You're a natural.

I'm... I'm not that kinda girl,
Dimitri.

Never had much luck
with the ladies.

(thunder rumbling)

(indistinct chatter)
(hums)

Anastasia. You look like hell.


Trouble?
No. No trouble.

(dishes clattering)
(indistinct chatter)

The last girl didn't make it.

Or the one before that.

Whoa! Whoa!

(chuckles)
Max: Down the hatch.

Ana: What's wrong, Max?

Max: Look at this.

Hmm. She's a monster.

(thunder rumbles)
Man: <i>Coming through!</i>

Headwaiter: Get it all up here.
Get it all on the inside.

And clean yourself up.
I have to look at that face.

Where the hell are the lights?
Everyone gather...

Hurry up! God damn it!

Headwaiter: There you are.
(camera shutter clicks)

Why aren't you ready?
We didn't expect you so soon.

Please, let me show you
to your table.

Follow me.
Groom: Can't believe this.

Headwaiter: Champagne
for the Groom, on the double.

(indistinct chatter)
(rain pattering)

(wind howling)

Who's she?
Nobody.

Oh.

Dimitri: Ana!

Ana: Yeah?
Can you go down the fuse box?

Bring the power back? Thanks.

Can you help me?

It's too dark. I can't see.
I can.

(footsteps approaching)
(door squeaks open)

(Bride panting)

Ana: It's okay.
(Bride sniffles)

Ana.
Come here.

I know.
It feels like a nightmare.

That's normal.

Headwaiter: There she is.

How beautiful. A vision.

The lights are back on,

and it's time for you
to take your place.

With me.


Who do you think you are?
Amateur!

Marsha:
Ana, it's time to wake up.

Hmm?
(Marsha chuckles)

Pilot: (grunts) Hey? I'm here!

Marsha: It seems
you have a following.


Pilot: Hi!
Here we go.

(Pilot pants)
Take this.

Okay?

Hmm, they're getting
younger and younger.

Hi!

You ladies with the nurses?

Birders.
Pilot: Bird watchers?

Mm-hmm. Smoke?
Oh, yeah.

Cheers.

You see anything good?

Marsha: Mm-hmm.
What's with her?

She's in shock.

Someone scared her to death.

Well, she better snap out of it.

There's a war on.

Who are you?
Pilot: I'm the Pilot.

My plane went down on a storm.

Picked up a distress signal.
Came to help.

No good deed. Mm-hmm.

Huh.

I need to find my men.

(birds chirping)
Yeah.

I'm sure they'll be along.
Come on. Let's get moving.

Let the boys do their jobs.

Follow me. Bye!

(exhales deeply)

(engine revs)
Come on!

Hold on to me.

Where are we going?
Someplace better.

â™ª (whimsical music playing) â™ª

(gunshot echoes)

Whoo!

Ana: (pants) Where are we?
The front.

Where we belong.

Down the hatch!

What's in there?
Your rescue party.

You like parties, don't you?

No.
Well, you'll like this one.

(exhales) What is this?
U-boat. All that's left of it.

We took the liberty. This way!

I feel so tired.
Here.

You won't need this anymore.

You're in quite a storm.

I'll find you something
to change into.

(bed springs squeak)
Out cold.

I can't wait.

(stool squeak)
(footsteps approaching)

Bea: (grunts)
Remarkable reflexes.

Nice shot.
That'll come in handy.

Smoke?

So, what brings you here?

I think I'm bird watching.
Hmm. See anything good?

A swan? It looked like a swan.
Nasty creatures.

I never go near 'em.
(cups clattering)

What else do you remember?

Uh, there's a soldier
that came out of the sky.

He's a goner.
That's enough, Beatriz.

Do you remember your name?

(footsteps approaching)

Bea: Look.
Hmm. We'll call you Ana.

Here. That's B. I'm Gert.

Put this on.
(alarm blares)

She's waiting for you.

(Ana pants)
â™ª (whimsical music playing) â™ª

Marsha: Kill the lights.

You can't see anything
interesting in the light.

It suits you.

The storm cleared the sky.

Have a look.

Do you see the red one?

Ana: There aren't any red ones.

Marsha: Look further.

Do you see it?

That's Mars. The God of War.

Ana: (gasps) I'm getting dizzy.

Marsha: Of course, you are.

You've never seen
that far before.


(indistinct shouting)

Marsha: She's going down fast!
Oh! (laughs)

Come on!
Ana: What's happening?

(explosion)
Marsha: It's a war, Ana!

(cheering)
Marsha: Cleared the deck!

(women squealing)
Come on! We're living!

Bea: Whoo!
Live a little!

(explosion)
Marsha: Whoo! War is a bitch!

Goners! Goner!
(all cheering, laughing)

â™ª (whimsical music playing) â™ª

What are you waiting for?
Take off your clothes!

I can't swim.
Marsha: Liar!

I'll teach you
how to float, Ana.

Ana: No, I'd just sink.

Not here, you won't.
Come on!

You're okay.
Okay.

You're okay. You can lay back.
Okay.

Here. Go ahead.
I've got you. Lie back.

You're good.
(Ana breathes deeply)

(Ana laughs)
I've got you. I've got you.


I'm floating.
You're floating.

(both giggling)

Don't let go!
I'm never letting go.

(gunshots echoing)
(birds chirping)

Shoots straight.
Gert: Yeah?

Yeah.

Now, Ana,
we got you a little present.

Kind of like
a birthday present.

Look alive, Bea!
We need a target!

We need a sharpshooter, Ana.
(scoffs)

I think you're just the girl.
I've never been in a war.

You've been in a war
your whole life.

You just didn't know it.

Do you remember what happened
to you before you came here?

Before the storm?

No.
It wasn't a very good story.

So, I'm giving you a new one.
Is my story that bad?

So bad, you had to end it.

Am I dead?

Yes. Yes, you are dead, Ana,
but don't panic.

Girls are better off dead.
Why?

'Cause now, we're free.

You never had a chance
back there, Ana.

Chance for what?
A chance to win.

Come on.

Girls make excellent snipers.

A sniper must endure
uncomfortable positions

for hours.
I'm good at that.


They know how
to make themselves invisible.

Yeah, I'm good at that too.
We all are.

Where do I aim?

Marsha: Dead center.

Now, you have
to slow down your breathing.

A heartbeat
can throw off the shot.

So, when my heart stops,
that's when I shoot?

Exactly.

Now!
(gunshot)

I can always spot a natural.


Ana: When does Marsha sleep?
Bea: Marsha never sleeps.

She's a force of nature.

Marsha got me out of trouble.

Were you in a lot of trouble?

The worst.

Yeah, I think I was too.

It's okay.
You're on our side now.

Mm...

We don't have any souls.

<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

Do you like the radio?
(chuckles)

Marsha: These are
our instruments. Here.

Take this.
What do I say?

Mayday is our favorite.

They can't resist

<i>All clear. Carry on.</i>

Marsha: Let's go.

Gert: Woo-hoo!
(water splashes)

Bea: Look out below!

Ana: (gasps)
What are they doing?

Marsha: Falling.

Come on!

Down to your skivvies!

Ana: Oh, no, no.
I don't like heights.

Well, no wonder. You've always
been at the bottom.

Ana: Stop.

Feels good to fall, you know?

The further, the better. Whoop.

Bea: Ana! Come on, Ana!

Gert: Don't be a pussy!
Marsha: Hurry up!

Gert: Ana!

I'm an easy target...
Never say that!

You need to stop
hurting yourself

and start hurting others.

Gert's never afraid.

Gert's too thickheaded
to be afraid.

I mean that
in the best possible way.

I'm not like you.
Yes, you are!

I don't belong here.
Yes, you do.

You just can't see it yet.

We shouldn't have
left you alone.

You weren't ready.

Soon, you'll be
a whole new person,

the kind
that men only dream about.

What should I do?
Bea: Can you read me? Over.

Answer her.

Yes, I read you. Over.

Marsha: Can't sleep?

Ana: I had a bad dream.

Marsha: Don't worry.

All your dreams will die
soon enough.

Have a look at this.

Ana: Is that a new one?

Marsha: New stars are born
all the time.

Some girls say,
if they become too powerful,

they collapse and disappear.

But I don't believe that.

Ana: Why not?

Marsha: Because
it's never happened here.

Woman: <i>Pressure,
altitude, temperature.</i>

(radio signals changing)

Woman: <i>Transmitting.</i>
(beeping, electronic warbling)

<i>Okay. This should do it.</i>

No, no, no! Beatriz!

What are you doing?
Sending a weather balloon.

It tells us
where the storms are.

So, we know what's coming.

I'm shooting blind! (pants)


One at ten o'clock,
one at two o'clock,

and two dead ahead.

What?
Ana: I can see them.

Do what she says, Gertry.
Okay, then.

(inhales, exhales)

Marsha: Get down!

All clear.

â™ª (dramatic music playing) â™ª

(exhales sharply)

Marsha: Okay, girls!

It's time to go.

Ana: Where are we going?
Hunting.

(Man groans)


Shoot in open.

Go see if there are others.

Marsha: Go on. Go.

Hello, soldier.
I'm an airman. (coughs)

Not at the moment.
(gasps)

Nurse?
Yes, airman?

Will you hold my hand?
Sure.

I'm not gonna make it, am I?
Marsha: Shh.

Don't talk like that.

Can you get a message
to my wife?

You can give it to her yourself.

You're burning up.
Tell her that I love her.

Are you sure about that?

What?

(grunts sharply)

Are you sure you love your wife?

AirMan: Of course. (groans)
Do you think she loves you?

(Airman groans)
I'm not so sure.

I want a real nurse!

Marsha: It's possible
she never loved you

and she feels much better
without you around.


No more endless meals
to make,

filthy babies to wipe.

Maybe she has better things
to do now.

Or maybe she's here,
doing something important.

(Marsha grunts)
(Airman gasping)

Who are you? (groans)

I'm a friend of your wife's.

(Airman whimpers, gasps)

Ana: Been having dreams
about my life.

Gaining altitude.

Gert: Bad dreams?

I was living in my car.

Yeah, that's pretty bad.

Was that how you did it?

In your car?

No. I think it was an oven.

A lot of girls go in an oven.

Too much time in the kitchen.

What about you?

Take a guess.

Do you remember doing it?
No. It all goes away.

I don't know why it's taking you
so long to forget.


You're gonna feel so much
better when it's gone for good.

And Marsha just remembers?

remembers everything, yeah.

And what about Bea?

Hers was bad.
We don't talk about it.

Her nightmares are gone now.

A lot of girls just slip away.

They deserve better.

But don't worry.

They all get even
when they get here.

Ladies...

meet the man of her dreams.

Gert: Nothing!
Aw.

This poor man has no weapon.

I say we give him a head start,
so he has a chance.

He didn't give me a chance.
I know.

We're taking the higher ground.

Tell him to run, Ana.

Run.

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª

Come on. Let's go.
Not yet.

He needs to learn
what fear feels like.

What do you think, Ana?

Long enough?

Ana: Longer.

I can't see that far.

I can.

â™ª (tense music playing) â™ª

(Headwaiter groans)

(cries, coughs)

You should clean yourself up.

We have to look at that face.
(Headwaiter groans)


Amateur.
(scoffs)

What are those for?
Bea: Night vision.

So, I can see
what's in the dark, like you.

You don't wanna see that, Bea.

(distant whistle)
Oh.

What's the lay of the land,
Gerty?

(pistol clicks)

(all panting)

This is fantastic. Look at them.

They're all yours, Ana.

Take the shot.

Should we wake them up first?

They're not even in uniform.

We don't even know
what side they're on.

It's all the same side, Ana.

Maybe we should capture some
instead of kill them all.

We've tried that.
That was exhausting.

(Ana pants)

Take the shot!

(Ana groans)
(gunshot echoes)

Marsha: Where are you going?
(men shouting)

(gunshots continue)



(breathes heavily)

(Ana coughs)

That hurt me more

Where are my clothes?

You don't deserve

Why not?

<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

No one. Going for a swim.

Liar.

Ana! Ana!

We need to go! Bea's in trouble!

What?
Gert: They got her.

Ana: What do you mean? Who?
Gert: Fliers!

Ana: Okay. Come on.

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª


Got her.

Shoot, Ana.
Stop talking!

â™ª (tense music playing) â™ª

Finally.

â™ª (somber music playing) â™ª

Bea would never go out

She would if I told her to.

Marsha: <i>I didn't have a choice.
Ana's heart wasn't in it.</i>

<i>Now, it is.</i>

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª

No more going out on your own.

Marsha said it was

From now on, I make the plans.

Will you stay with me?
Gert will.

In case you have nightmares.

I don't want
any more nightmares.

You stay. I'll go.
No.

It's easier for me.
I'll get used to it.

Marsha: Okay, Ana!
Time to clear the decks!


Marsha: Where are you going?

Stop that.

(bombs whistling)

(explosion)
Ana: Go! Move!

(propellers whirling)

â™ª ("Love is Blue" playing) â™ª

(plane engine thrumming)

(music concludes)

(artillery fire continues
distantly)

(birds chirping)

Gert: <i>Air.</i>

<i>Avalanche.</i>

<i>Cloud.</i>

<i>Cycle.</i>

<i>Hail.</i>

Halo.

Hurricane.

Did you switch sides?
Ana: No. Just trying these on.

Hey, I brought you something.

From a flier.

I love them.
Ana: All right. We're resting.

Bea: Been active lately.
Gert: Mm-hmm.

The wars always get out of hand.

And soon,
everyone will be in on it.

How do you feel?

Foggy.
Ears ringing?

Hallucinations?

I heard music.

(exhales deeply)

Sleep it off.

Next time,
just stick with Marsha.

Ana: No.
I don't need her anymore.

I got them all.

You're not the girl
that I thought you were.

â™ª (tense music playing) â™ª

Oh, yeah? Who am I?

You're nobody.

(grunts)
What are you doing?

I've stopped hurting myself.
Learning to hurt others.


You fight like a girl.
(scoffs)

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª


Trouble?

Ana: No trouble.

Ana: Bea... get inside.

(both scream)
Ana: Go!

Jesus!

Ana: Marsha!


(engines whoosh)
(explosion)

Gert: Go out there.
Ana: Marsha!

Marsha, come down!
Bea needs you.

You look like hell.

Sit.

Sit.

Where are the others?

I don't know.

I'm lost.

Yeah, me too.

I want to be someplace
without a war.

I don't know if there is one.

Maybe we should go home.

Home?



Hmm.

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª



Marsha: Bad dream?

No.

Everyone dreams
of something better, Ana.

It doesn't mean
you're gonna get it.

(gasps, pants)

Where is he?
He had to go.

You're a monster.

Mm-hm. We're all monsters.

(grunts)
You still fight like a girl.

(both grunt)

(yelps)
Thanks.

(Marsha groans)
â™ª (melodious music playing) â™ª

(breathes deeply)

Gert! Gert. I wanna go back.

Gert: To what?
To my life.

Gert: Why on earth
would you wanna do that?

Because I had a dream
it could get better.

You dream too much
for your own good.

Please, just show me
the way to go.

I don't know. I wouldn't
even know where to start.

Gert, I know
you can figure it out. (pants)

â™ª (dramatic music playing) â™ª

Maybe it could be better.

I don't think you belong here.

Then, please, help me.

Please.


Man on radio: <i>Anybody read me?</i>

<i>Are you there, ma'am?
Hope you can still hear me.</i>

Ana: Who is this?
(Man on radio sighs)

<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>
You're still here?

Man on radio:
<i>Not for long. I'm...</i>

<i>I'm sorry.
I can't make it to you.</i>

<i>It's just fumes down here.</i>

<i>You know, ma'am, I...</i>

<i>never thought
it would end like this. I...</i>


Dimitri: (pants) I...
thought I could save you.

I thought I'd find you
someplace better.

with the ladies.</i>


<i>You should get off the radio
now and just...</i>

<i>just let me go.</i>

I can't do that.

Dimitri: <i>Why not?</i>

Because I'm not that kinda girl.

Ana: <i>Dimitri.</i>

Dimitri: <i>It's... so dark now.
I'm tired.</i>

(signal breaking up)
Dimitri?

Come back.
(pants)

It's so cold.
Come back! Please, come back.

(both pant)

Dimitri, you need
to go to sleep now.

<i>I'm not supposed
to sleep on the job.</i>

Just this once.
It'll slow down your breathing.

<i>Save your air.</i>
Huh.

Yes, ma'am.

That's a good idea.
(static)

<i>Here I go.</i>
There you go.


Gert: You remember him?

I remember everything.

Yeah, you definitely
don't belong here.

(chuckles)
(sniffles)

Gert: We're going
to need more help.

There's someone
I think you should meet.

(engine revving)

Woman on radio: <i>The following is
an emergency forecast.</i>

<i>It's time to clear the decks.</i>

<i>There is cause for alarm.
I'm coming undone.</i>

<i>The weather outlook
is threatening.</i>

<i>There's a dark haze in the sky.
Nothing is visible anymore.</i>

<i>Even Gertrude's gone soft.
It's useless.</i>

Outta gas?

Are you June?
You must be the new girl.

Woman on radio:
<i>All the stars are falling.</i>

<i>We are below
normal temperatures,</i>

<i>and no one seems to care.</i>

<i>Who does she think she is?</i>
June: Marsha's not herself.

Marsha: <i>Why won't
her dreams just die?</i>

I never heard her
sound like this.

I don't need gas.

What's the problem, then?
I need to go.

Okay. How far?
Far.

To where I was before the storm.

Why the hell
would you wanna do that?

Because I'm done with this.

That's not what I heard.

Ana.

You got a smoke?

Gert told me not to bring these.

Gert can be a drag.

Light me?

Why are you
all the way out here?

(hisses sharply)

I don't play well with others.

I'm going back.
I still have a friend there.

I just spoke to him
on the radio.

What a phenomenal girl you are.

And how do you imagine
you'd get there?

Swim.

You can't swim
against the currents.

I'm a strong swimmer.

why Marsha's been acting up.

You're outshining her.
Please.

Gert said you could help us.

I don't think we're seeing
the whole picture.

No one could see that.
Would be interesting, though.

You'd have to

be in the right place
at the right time.


I always thought we'd get
much farther than this.

A girl gets tired
of the same, old yarn.

But it can't happen.

Why not?

You ever think about
what happens to us

if you go, Ana?
Ana: No.

We lose. End of story.

End of us. All of us.
No. You can't lose.

There's so many girls.
(scoffs) Okay.

Didn't Marsha tell you
what happens when a star dies?

It's like that.

If a star goes,

everything around it
gets pulled in.

And we disappear.


It's just the way it works.
Sorry to break it to you.

You're still gonna need this.

(electronic warbling, beeping)

So what did she say?
I'm not going anywhere.

Gert: Why not?
I'm just not.

Well, if it's about us,
don't worry.

We know what happens.
Bea: Yeah.

I'll be your wingman.
Ana: No.

No.

If she's happy, I'm happy.

<i>â™ª No, no-no-no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No, no-no-no-no-no
No-no, no-no â™ª</i>

You could come with me.
You could come with me!

It's too late for us.
Bea: But not for you.

Ana: I can't do that.

I can't.

I'm tired of seeing
all the girls in trouble.

If you go back,
maybe you can help the next one.

What about the girls here?

Well, we asked them.

Come.

(singers vocalizing)

(electronic warbling, beeping)

What is this?
(all vocalizing)

Music.

(overlapping voices,
singers vocalizing)

(all vocalizing)

(indistinct chatter)

Okay.

So, when the storm
is strong enough,

you'll swim back
the way you came.

Bea's balloons
will measure the storm.

We'll get you
to the center of it,

where you'll be
a little lighter,

and you might be able
to just slip through.

You'll have to swim directly
into the current.

You can't be off,
even by a hair.

You'll have to be right on time.
But I don't know when that is.

Where will she be
if she's not there on time?

Nowhere good.

(footsteps approaching)
(objects clatter)

Then let's make sure
she's on time.

(chuckles)
(static)

(radio cross-chatter
through headphones)

Woman on radio:
<i>...got the lightning.</i> (laughs)

<i>Thank you.</i>
(indistinct chatter on radio)

I think she might
suspect something.

(thunder rumbles)

Marsha: (grunts)
I know what you're doing.

You're going back
to the kitchen.

You don't need
to worry about me, Marsha.

I know what to do.

After everything I've given you?

Ana: What have you given me?


You made me into a psychopath.
It's the same thing!

(Marsha pants)

You won't be winning, Ana.

I can live with that.

You're going back
to so much darkness.

In the dark, I'll see the stars.

â™ª (dramatic music playing) â™ª

(thunder rumbling)

Ana: <i>Are you sure
this is what you want?</i>

This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

I don't wanna leave you.

Then I'll go first.

Close your eyes.


(thunder rumbling)
(bottles clinking)

(alarm blaring)


Go on.
(breathes heavily)

I don't know how to thank you.
Up you go.

Go on.

Gerty, I can't do it!

I can't do it, I can't do it!
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

You're a strong girl.
You always were.

Ana.

Remember who you are.

Now, go.
(pants)

â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª


Gert: <i>Okay, June. Is it time?</i>

Yep. The tide's coming in.

Gert: <i>Copy that.
Has anyone seen Marsha?</i>

June: <i>That's a negative.</i>
Gert: <i>Okay.</i>

Bea! I need your readings!

(beeping, warbling)
Gert: <i>Bea?</i>

<i>Bea: Up here!</i>
Where?

You should see it up here,
Gerty. It's heaven!

Beatriz, come down here
right now!

I have to take
the readings myself.

The balloons
won't be accurate enough.

Where did you even get a plane?

I took the liberty. (chuckles)

Bea: <i>Gert, I have measurements.</i>

<i>Do you read me?</i>
Yes, I read you.

The storm is three miles out,
and the wind shear is 60 knots.

Central velocity...
Ten, eight, 71.

<i>Conditions are good to go.</i>

This is dangerous.
Please come down.

I'll see you soon.
This is Beatriz. Over and out.

(engine thrumming)

Gert: Let's give her the signal.

On my mark. Nine, eight,

seven, six, five, four...

<i>Three...</i>
June: <i>Three...</i>

Two...

Mark!
(gunshot)

Oh, Bea!
Where's Ana? Can you see her?

â™ª (whimsical music playing) â™ª

Gert: How far is the storm?

It's here.

(Ana exhales sharply)

I've got her! Yes! Yes!


There she goes.
(Ana gasping, panting)

Gert: Wait. That's not right.

What?
She's swimming the wrong way.

(thunder rumbling)
(pants)

Gert: What's going on?
It's a riptide.

No.
It's pulling her under.

(Ana gasps, screams)

Gert: She's too far.

Help! Help me!

Mayday!

Ana: <i>Mary.</i>

<i>Alpha.</i>

<i>Yankee.</i>

<i>Delta.</i>

<i>Alpha.</i>

This is an emergency.

Listen carefully
to the following instructions.

She can't hear you.
Yes, she can.

<i>Stay calm in a riptide.</i>

<i>Do not attempt to fight it.</i>

Float until you feel
the current weaken.

Wake up.

Ana, wake up!
â™ª (ominous music playing) â™ª

(gasps, coughs)

Stay afloat.

<i>Do not attempt to swim...</i>

<i>until you feel
the riptide weaken.</i>

The wind's shifting.
She's back on course.

(clanking, thudding)

(laughs)
It's over, Ana.

You can break free.

Good girl.

(electrical sizzling)

(waves rushing)

(indistinct chatter)

â™ª (tense music playing) â™ª
(inhales deeply)

â™ª (theme music playing) â™ª

<i>â™ª No, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no-no-no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
No-no-no, no-no-no â™ª</i>

Woman on radio: <i>These
frequencies are of pure tone.</i>

(overlapping voices
in various languages)

Woman 2: <i>The sea is very dark
and very deep.</i>

(overlapping voices)
(woman laughing)

Woman 3: <i>Wearing my last nerves.</i>

Woman 4: <i>Time for you
to say good night, boys.</i>

Woman 5: <i>Wow. Every good day
starts with smoke and lightning.</i>
