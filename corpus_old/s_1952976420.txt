My oracle ... what vision did you dream?

Titans ...

Titans ... unleashed

By whom?

King Hyperion

He seeks the Epirus to rule over mankind.

We must pray.

Hyperion is here.

He comes for me.

We must go now.

My oracle.

You were presented with vision.

What have you seen?

The slave by the water

He is touched by the Gods

If he embraces Hyperion

all of Greece will be destroyed.

Summon the guards.
