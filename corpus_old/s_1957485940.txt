(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)

This is where our magic comes from?

Mm-hmm.

This candle holds the miracle
given to our family.

How did we get a miracle?

Long ago,

when my three babies had just been born,

<i>your</i> Abuelo <i>Pedro and I
were forced to flee our home.</i>

<i>And though many joined us,</i>

<i>hoping to find a new home,</i>

<i>we could not escape the dangers</i>

<i>and your </i>abuelo <i>was lost.</i>

<i>But in our darkest moment,</i>

<i>we were given a miracle.</i>

<i>The candle became a magical flame</i>

<i>that could never go out.</i>

<i>And it blessed us
with a refuge in which to live.</i>

<i>A place of wonder.</i>

YOUNG MIRABEL: <i>An </i>encanto.

ABUELA: <i>An </i>encanto.

<i>The miracle grew.</i>

<i>And our house,</i>

<i>our </i>casita <i>itself</i>

<i>came alive to shelter us.</i>

<i>When my children came of age,</i>

<i>the miracle blessed each
with a magic Gift to help us.</i>

<i>And when their children came of age...</i>

YOUNG MIRABEL: <i>They got magic, too.</i>

ABUELA: (CHUCKLING) <i>That's right!</i>

<i>And together, our family's Gifts</i>

<i>have made our new home a paradise.</i>

Tonight, this candle
will give you your Gift, <i>mi vida.</i>

Strengthen our community,
strengthen our home.

Make your family proud.

Make my family proud.

(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)

Yes, yes, <i>casita, </i>we're going!

(YOUNG MIRABEL GIGGLING)

What do you think my Gift will be?

You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal.

Whatever Gift awaits

<i>will be just as special as you.</i>

Who's asking?

ALL: Us!

Well, "us," I can't just talk

{\an8}I'm only part of the amazing Madrigals.

Who's all the amazing Madrigals?

Ah, you're not gonna

I can't remember all the Gifts!

But I don't know who is who.

All right, all right, relax!

It is physically impossible to relax!

Tell us everything!

What are your powers?

Just tell us what everyone can do!

And that's why coffee's for grown-ups.

Gets weird</i>

-<i>My family's amazing
</i>-<i>Mirabel</i>

-<i>And I'm in my family so
</i>-<i>Mirabel</i>

<i>Well</i>

-(MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY)
-ABUELA: (SHOUTS) Mirabel!

What are you doing?

Uh, they were just asking
about the family and...

She was about to tell us
about her super awesome Gift!

Oh, Mirabel didn't get one. (SQUEAKS)

You didn't get a Gift?

-Um...
-Mirabel! Delivery!

I gave you the special

since you're the only
Madrigal kid with no Gift.

I call it the "Not Special Special"

since, uh, you have no Gift.

Thanks.

Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.

The last Gift ceremony was a bummer.

Last one being yours

-that did not work.
-Uh-huh.

If I was you, I'd be really sad.

Well, my little friend, I am not.

Because the truth is, Gift or no Gift,

I am just as special
as the rest of my family.

ISABELA: Who wants more pink?

LUISA: All right, guys,
where do I drop the wagon?

Maybe your Gift is being in denial.

PEPA: I made a rainbow!

WOMAN: Get the chairs out of the way.

(MIRABEL GRUNTING)

Sorry. Excuse me.

PEPA: Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?

Huh? Whoop!

ABUELA: Lift it higher. Higher.

CAMILO: Hey, nice job over there.

-JOSÃ‰: Yeah, yeah.
-Camilo, we need another JosÃ©!

JosÃ©!

ABUELA: Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!

I'm on it! Careful, sis!


PEPA: My baby's night has to be perfect,

and it's not perfect.
And people are going to be coming.

-And nothing's ready.
-You're tornado-ing the flowers!

The flowers!

Did someone say flowers?

-MAN: Isabela!
-(WOMAN LAUGHS)

FÃ‰LIX: Our angel, our angel!

Please don't clap.

-Thank you.
-Oh, it's nothing.


A little sisterly advice,

if you weren't always trying too hard,

you wouldn't be in the way.

Actually, Isa, this is called helping.

And I'm not in the way. You are. (GRUNTS)

-(GRUNTING)
-Whoa.

Excuse me.

<i>Mi vida</i>, you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.

I know, <i>MamÃ¡.</i>

I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.

-She's right, <i>amor.
</i>-Eesh.

First Gift ceremony since yours.

A lot of emotions.

-Bee stings!
-AGUSTÃN: And I've been there.

<i>Ay, AgustÃ­n.</i>

When me and your <i>tÃ­o </i>FÃ©lix
married into the family,

outsiders who had no Gift,
never, ever would...

surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel

un-ceptional.

Okay, <i>Papi.</i>

-I'm just saying, I get it.
-Eat.

<i>Mi amor, </i>if you ever wanna talk...

I gotta put out the stuff.

The house isn't gonna decorate itself.

Sorry, you could. You look great.

<i>-Corazon,</i> remember!
-Yeah, remember!

-You have nothing to prove!
-You have nothing to prove!

MIRABEL: Mm-hmm.

(JULIETA SIGHS)

{\an8}FÃ‰LIX: Ah, <i>los musicos.</i>

{\an8}You guys can set up over here.

{\an8}ABUELA: Clean your rooms!
I don't care how big they are.

TIPLE MAESTRO: Has anybody seen my <i>tiple?</i>

-ABUELA: One hour!
-(GASPS)

Oh! (GRUNTS) No, no, no!

Maybe you should leave the decorations

to someone else?

No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you. Ooh!

Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

Mirabel, I know you want to help.

But tonight must go perfectly.

The whole town relies
on our family, on our Gifts.

So, the best way for some of us to help

is to step aside.

Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.

Okay?

Mm-hmm.

(WIND BLOWING)

-Pepa! You have a cloud!
-I know, <i>MamÃ¡.</i>

But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

<i>MamÃ¡,</i> be nice to Mirabel, okay?

You know tonight will be hard for her.

ABUELA: If the Gift ceremony
doesn't go well this time,

tonight will be hard for us all.

(MIRABEL SIGHS)

FÃ‰LIX: Antonio!

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

Everyone's looking for you.

This present will self-destruct

if you don't take it

in three,

two,

one... Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Nervous?

You have nothing to worry about.

You're gonna get your Gift
and open that door

and it's gonna be the coolest ever.

I know it.


Well, in that impossible scenario,

you'd stay here in the nursery with me.

(WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY) Forever.

And I'd get you all to myself.

I wish you could have a door.

You know what?

You don't have to worry about me,

'cause I have an amazing family

and an amazing house.

And an amazing you.

And seeing you get
your special Gift and your door,

that's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.


I am gonna miss having
the world's best roomie.



and I made this so,

when you move into your cool, new room,

you always have something to snuggle with.

All right, <i>hombrecito, </i>you ready?

(<i>COLOMBIA, MI ENCANTO</i> PLAYING)

Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.


Okay, okay, we're going!

MIRABEL: Ow! Ow!

Look at you! All grown up.

Pepi, <i>amor, </i>you're gonna get him all wet.

making your papa proud.

I don't sound like that.

(IMITATES FÃ‰LIX) I don't sound like that.

We'll be waiting at your door.

Okay, okay. <i>Vamo, vamo, vamo.</i>

I would never ruin Antonio's night.

Is that really what you think?

What I think is that
today was very hard for you.

That's... (GRUNTS)

I was looking out for the family.

And I might not be
super strong like Luisa,

or effortlessly perfect
like <i>seÃ±orita perfecta </i>Isabela

who's never even had
a bad hair day, but...


I wish you could see yourself
the way I do.

You are perfect just like this.

You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.

Mm-hmm.

You just healed my hand
with an <i>arepa con queso.</i>

I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter

-with her wonderful brain...

Stop!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(IN ENGLISH) I know what I saw.


Mira, my brother Bruno

If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...

If our miracle is dying...

We cannot lose our home again.


Open my eyes.

If the answer is here, help me find it.

Help me protect our family.

Help me save our miracle.

I will save the miracle.

(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYS)

Wait. How do I save a miracle?


I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.

Oh, I have no idea.

But there is one person in this family

who hears everything about everything.

<i>So, if anyone would know
what's wrong with the magic...</i>

-Hey!
-MIRABEL: <i>...it's her.</i>

Dolores, hey.

You know, out of all my older cousins,

you're, like, my favorite cousin,

so I feel like I can talk
to you about anything,

ergo you can talk to me about anything.

Like the problem with the magic last night

that no one seemed to worry about,

but maybe you heard about that
maybe I should know about.

Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores

so you can have seconds.

Worth a shot. Ah! (GRUNTS)


The only one worried
about the magic is you

and the rats talking in the walls.

Oh, and Luisa,

I heard her eye twitching
all night. (SQUEAKS)

There we go.

Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.

-Luisa.
-ABUELA: Family.

We are all thankful

for Antonio's wonderful new (GRUNTS) Gift.

I told them to warm up your seat.

Thank you, ToÃ±ito.

I'm sure today we'll find a way

to put your blessings to good use.

you're totally freaking out.

Any chance you maybe know something

about last night with the magic...

-(GASPS) You do!
-ABUELA: Mirabel!

If you can't pay attention,
I will help you.

-Oh, actually...
<i>-Casita!</i>


As I was saying,

we must never take our miracle
for granted,

so today we will work twice as hard.

-Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa.
-Stop.


First, an announcement.

I've spoken to the GuzmÃ¡ns

about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.

Dolores, do we have a date?

Tonight. He wants five babies.

-(ISABELA GULPS)
-Wonderful!

Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela

will bring a new generation
of magical blessings

and make both of our families stronger.

Luisa! (YELPS)

You gotta tell me about the magic.

What's going on? What are you hiding?

Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,

so maybe you should just go home.

Luisa, my house is leaning to the...

Dolores said your eye was twitching,

and it never twitches.

Something's making you nervous.

Hey, move. You're gonna
make me drop a donkey.

Luisa, will you just... (SCOFFS)

-Just tell me what it is.
-There's nothing to tell.

You're obviously worried about something.

Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic

and it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me

-what's wrong...
-(LOUDLY) Nothing's wrong!

Wow, uh, sorry.

That... That snuck out there.
What I meant was, um...

Why would anything be wrong?

I'm totally fine. The magic's fine.

Luisa's fine. I'm totally not nervous.

Your eye is doing the thing...

<i>I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous</i>

<i>I'm as tough as the crust
Of the Earth is</i>

Okay.

LUISA:
<i>I move mountains</i>

<i>I move churches</i>

<i>And I glow 'cause I know
What my worth is</i>

Of course, I mean...
Hey, where are you going?

<i>I don't ask
How hard the work is</i>

<i>Got a rough
Indestructible surface</i>

<i>Diamonds and platinum</i>

<i>I find 'em
I flatten 'em</i>

<i>I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded</i>

<i>But under the surface
I feel berserk</i>

<i>As a tightrope walker
In a three-ring circus</i>

<i>Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like</i>

<i>"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"</i>

-(SCREAMS, WHIMPERS)
<i>-Under the surface</i>

<i>I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
If I can't be of service</i>

<i>A flaw or a crack</i>

<i>The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back</i>

<i>What breaks the camel's back?</i>

<i>It's pressure
Like a drip, drip, drip</i>

<i>That'll never stop</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Give it to your sister
Your sister's older</i>

<i>Give her all the heavy things
We can't shoulder</i>

<i>Who am I
If I can't run with the ball?</i>

<i>If I fall to pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip</i>

<i>And it won't let go</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Pressure like
A tick, tick, tick</i>

<i>Till it's ready to blow</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Give it to your sister
Your sister's stronger</i>

<i>See if she can hang on
A little longer</i>

<i>Who am I
If I can't carry it all?</i>

<i>If I falter</i>

<i>Under the surface</i>

<i>I hide my nerves
And it worsens</i>

<i>I worry
Something is gonna hurt us</i>

<i>Under the surface</i>

<i>The ship doesn't swerve</i>

<i>As it heard
How big the iceberg is</i>

<i>Under the surface
I think about my purpose</i>

<i>Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominos</i>

<i>A light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin'</i>

<i>But on and on it goes
But wait</i>

<i>If I could shake</i>

<i>The crushing weight
Of expectations</i>

<i>Would that free
Some room up for joy</i>

<i>Or relaxation?</i>

<i>Or a simple pleasure
Instead we measure</i>

<i>This growing pressure
Keeps growing</i>

<i>Keep going
'Cause all we know is</i>

<i>Pressure like
A drip, drip, drip</i>

<i>That'll never stop</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Give it to your sister
It doesn't hurt</i>

<i>And see if she can handle
Every family burden</i>

<i>Watch as she buckles
And bends but never breaks</i>

<i>No mistakes</i>

<i>Just pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip</i>

<i>And it won't let go</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Pressure like
A tick, tick, tick</i>

<i>Till it's ready to blow</i>

<i>Whoa</i>

<i>Give it to your sister
And never wonder</i>

<i>If the same pressure
Would have pulled you under</i>

<i>Who am I
If I don't have what it takes?</i>

<i>No cracks
No breaks</i>

<i>No mistakes
No pressure</i>



I think you're carrying
way too much... (GRUNTS)

Maybe I overdo it.

Yep.

Um... There is something you should know.

Last night, when you saw the cracks,

I felt weak.


-MAN: Luisa! The donkeys!
-On it!

Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?

What do you think's hurting the magic?

Don't know, but I heard
the grown-ups once.

Before <i>TÃ­o </i>Bruno left,

he had, like,
some terrible vision about it.

<i>TÃ­o </i>Bruno? What was in his vision?

No one knows. They never found it.

But if something's wrong with the magic,

start with Bruno's tower.

Find that vision.

Wait! How do you find a vision?

-What am I even looking for?
-(DONKEY BRAYS)

If you find it, you'll know.

But be careful.

That place is off limits for a reason.

ABUELA: Such a perfect match.

So perfect.

And so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)


Hmm.

<i>Casita.</i>

Can you turn off the sand?

(FLOOR TILES RUMBLING)

You can't help in here?

I'll be fine.

I need to do this.

For you, for <i>Abuela,</i>

maybe a little for me.


"Find the vision, save the..."




Wow.

-Oh, hello.
-(SQUAWKS)

Lot of stairs,

but at least I'll have a friend.

No. He flew away immediately.

-(SQUAWKING)
-(GROANS)

All right.


<i>There's so many stairs
In the casa Madrigal</i>

<i>You think there would be
Another way to</i>

<i>Get so high
'Cause we're magic, but no</i>

Magical how many stairs fit in here!

Bruno, your room is the worst!

Where are you coming from in such a hurry?

I'm sorry, I was...

-What is in your hair?
-(HESITATING)

LUISA: My Gift!

-(SOBBING) I'm losing my Gift!
-What?

Mirabel and I were having this little talk

about me carrying too much.

So, I tried not to carry so much,

but I realized it was putting me behind.

And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.

And I felt really bad,

so I was grabbing all the donkeys,

but then when I went to throw

the donkeys in the barn, they were

heavy! (SOBBING)

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

What did you do? What did you say to her?

Nothing. I... I don't...

-Mirabel... (SIGHS)
-(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

I have to go get the GuzmÃ¡ns

for Isabela's engagement.

Stay away from Luisa
until I can talk to her.

Tonight, we can't have any more problems.

And whatever you're doing, stop doing it.

-(LUISA SOBBING)

Why am I in your vision, Bruno?

-(THUNDER RUMBLES)
-(GASPS)

<i>TÃ­a!</i> Jeez.

Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to...

Shoo, shoo, shoo! (GRUNTS)

I just wanted to get
the last of ToÃ±ito's things

and then I heard the name we do not speak.

Great. Now I'm thundering,

and that thunder will lead to a drizzle

and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...

Clear skies, clear skies.


<i>TÃ­a </i>Pepa<i>? If... (HESITATING)</i>

If he had a vision about someone,

what would it mean for them?

We don't talk about Bruno.

I know. It's just hypothetically,

if he saw you...

Mirabel, please, we need to
get ready for the GuzmÃ¡ns.

I just wanna know if it was generally

positive or, like, less positive...

-It was a nightmare!
-FÃ©lix!

Hey, she needs to know, Pepi,
she needs to know.

We don't talk about Bruno.

He would see something terrible.
And then...

(MAKES TICKING SOUND)
Boom! It would happen.

We don't talk about Bruno.

What if you didn't understand what he saw?

Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Miraboo! Got your party pants on?
'Cause I...

(GRUNTS, CHUCKLES)

I broke into Bruno's tower.

I found his last vision.
The family's in trouble.

The magic is dying. The house is breaking,
Luisa's gift is fading.

And I think it's all because of me?

<i>PÃ¡?</i>

(DOORBELL RINGS)

We say nothing.

<i>Abuela </i>wants tonight to be perfect.

Until the GuzmÃ¡ns leave,

you did not break into Bruno's tower.

The magic is not dying.
The house is not breaking.

Luisa's gift is not fading.

Just act normal.

-No one has to know.
-(DOLORES SQUEAKS)


She's gonna tell everyone.

-ABUELA: Time to eat!
-<i>Miercoles.</i>

The GuzmÃ¡ns and the Madrigals together

will be so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

Yes. Then, let's hope tonight
is not a horrible disaster.

Luisa, could you bring over the piano?

Is it why you came back or...

-(EXHALES DEEPLY)
<i>-TÃ­o </i>Bruno?

Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.

You were never supposed to see
that vision. No one was.

-But... (SPITS)
-A little salt.

-Sugar.
-(SPITS)

(BRUNO SPEAKING SPANISH)

MIRABEL: (IN ENGLISH) Wait.

Have you been in here patching the cracks?

Oh, that? No, no, no.

I'm too scared to go near those things.

All the patching's done by Hernando.

Who is Hernando?

(IN DEEP VOICE) I'm Hernando
and I'm scared of nothing!

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
It's actually me. (CHUCKLES)

I used to say my real Gift
was "acting." (CHUCKLES)

(IN ALTERED VOICE) I'm Jorge.
I make the spackle.

How long have you been back here?


You never left.

Well, I left my tower,

which was, you know, a lot of stairs

and here, eh, kitchen adjacent.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

Ooh, ooh, plus, free entertainment.

So, what do you like? You like sports?

Game shows? Telenovelas?

(RATS SQUEALING)

Their love could never be.

I don't understand.

Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia

so she can't remember that she's his aunt.

It's like a very forbidden kind of...

I don't understand why you left,

but didn't leave.

Oh, well, because, huh,

the mountains around
the <i>encanto </i>are pretty tall.

And, uh, like I said,
free food and everything.

You guys love the free food, don't ya?

Always hungry. Never satisfied.

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

Yeah, my Gift wasn't helping the family,

but, uh, I love my family, you know?

I just don't know how to...
I just don't know how to...

Well, anyway, I think
you should go, because, um,

I don't really have a good reason,

but, if I did, you'd be like,

"I should go,
because that's a good reason."

Why was I in your vision?

<i>TÃ­o </i>Bruno?

I just wanted to make
the family proud of me.

Just once.

But if I should stop,

if I'm hurting my family,

just tell me.

-I can't tell you...
-(MIRABEL SIGHS)

...because I don't know.

I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your Gift.

Abuela <i>worried about the magic.</i>

<i>So, she begged me to look into the future.</i>

<i>See what it meant.</i>

<i>And I saw the magic in danger.</i>

<i>Our house breaking.</i>

<i>And then, and then, and then, I saw you.</i>

<i>But the vision was different.
It... it would change.</i>

<i>And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.</i>

<i>Like your future was undecided.</i>

<i>But I knew how it was gonna look.</i>

<i>I knew what everyone would think</i>

<i>because I'm Bruno</i>

<i>and everyone always assumes
the worst, so...</i>


You left to protect me?

I don't know which way it'll go,

but my guess...

the family, the <i>encanto</i>

and the fate of the miracle itself...

Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

Or maybe I'm wrong.

You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...

(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Look, if I could help any more, I would,

but that's all I know.

Good luck. I wish I could've seen more.

Yeah.

Yeah.


You wish you could have
seen more, so see more!

Have another vision.

Oh. No, no. See,
I don't do visions anymore.

-But you could.
-But I won't.

You can't say the weight of the world

is on your shoulders. The end.

If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.

Maybe it'll show me what to do.

Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,

you wrecked my vision cave.

Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.

-We'll find one.
-Where?

ANTONIO: Use my room.

The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.

Our family needs help,

and you need to get outta here.

(RATS SQUEAKING)

Meh.


(KIDS GASP, PANT)

You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.

Think of the family.

I was thinking of my daughter.

Pepa, calm down.

-I'm doing my best.
-Yes.

You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

<i>MamÃ¡,</i> you've always been
too hard on Mirabel.

Look around.

We must protect our family, our e<i>ncanto.</i>

-We cannot lose our home.
-(DOOR OPENS)

<i>SeÃ±ora, perdon.</i>

People in town are becoming anxious

about the magic.

They want to see you.

in that vision for a reason.

Find her.

-(RUMBLING)
-(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

We might wanna hurry.

You can't hurry the future.

Um... (CHUCKLES)

What if I show you something worse?

If I see something

that you don't like, you're gonna be all,

"Bruno makes bad things happen.

"Oh, he's creepy
and his vision killed my goldfish."

I don't think you make bad things happen.

Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.

You can do this.

For the nerves.

I can do this, I can do this.

(PEOPLE EXCLAIM)

BRUNO: It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!

No. I need to know which way it goes.

There's gotta be an answer.

Something we're not seeing!

You're looking at
the same thing that I am.

If there was something else...

There! Over there!

BRUNO: Butterfly!

Follow the butterfly!

Where is that?

BRUNO: (HESITATING) It's all out of order.

It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!

I think you're gonna help the candle!

How?

Uh, there's someone with you. And you...

-You fight her!
-What?

Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?

Am I fighting or hugging?

An embrace. An embrace!

To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.

Embrace who?

BRUNO: Oh... Almost there.

-Who is it?
-Almost there. Oh, oh.

I got it!


Oh, your sister? That's great!



(VISION SHATTERS)

MIRABEL: (SCOFFS) Why would
embracing Isabela do anything?

I don't know. Our family got a miracle.

How do you help a family miracle?

You hug a sister.

Mirabel? (SIGHS) Mirabel? (BURBLING)

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Mirabel?

Well, I think we're running
out of time here.

It's not gonna work.

She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me!

Also, I don't know if you heard,

I ruined her proposal!

Plus, P.S...

-(WHISPERS) Mirabel?
-...she is just annoying.

-Of course it's Isabela!
-Mirabel?

What's her problem with me anyway?

She's the one with roses
coming out of her...


Sorry, sorry, sorry.

You see, you're missing the point.

The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.

It's up to you.

You're exactly what this family needs.

You just have to see it.

By yourself, after I leave. (GRUNTS)

What, you're not coming?

(IN DEEP VOICE) It was
your vision, Mirabel.

Not mine.

You're afraid <i>Abuela </i>will see you.

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yep.
I mean, yes, that too.

Hey, after you save the miracle,
come visit.

After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.

Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

(CASITA CREAKING)

Just gonna save the miracle.

With a hug.

Isa? Hey.

I know we've had our issues,

but I'm (HESITATES)

ready to be a better sister... to you.

So, we should just hug.

Let's hug it out, huh?

ISABELA: "Hug it out"?

Luisa can't lift an empanada,

Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!

Have you lost your mind?

(SMACKS LIPS)

Isa, I feel like you're upset.

And you know what cures being upset?

A warm embrace.

Get out.

-(HESITATING)
-Everything was perfect.

<i>Abuela </i>was happy. The family was happy.

You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.

Go on. Apologize.

I...

am...

sorry...

Hmm.

...that your life is so great!

Out.

Wait! (GRUNTS) Fine! I apologize!

I wasn't trying to ruin your life!


-you selfish...
-(GASPS)

...entitled princess!

"Selfish"?

I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!

And literally, the only thing

you have ever done for me
is mess things up!

Nothing is messed up!

You can still marry that big dumb hunk!

I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!

Oh, my gosh.

Isa,

that is a very serious confession.


Bring it in.

Isa?


<i>I just made</i> s<i>omething unexpected</i>

It's okay! Everything's...

We're gonna save the miracle. The magic...

What are you talking about?

Look at our home! Look at your sister!

Please just... Isabela wasn't happy.

Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.

No, no, no. She needed me
to ruin her proposal.

-And then we did all this!
-(ABUELA GRUNTS)

And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...

-Mirabel.
-That's why I'm in the vision!

I'm saving the miracle!

You have to stop, Mirabel!

The cracks started with you.

-Bruno left because of you.
-(CRACKING)

Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.

Because of you!

I don't know why you weren't given a Gift,

but it is not an excuse

-(CRACKING GROWS LOUDER)

I will never be good enough for you.

Will I?

No matter how hard I try.

No matter how hard any of us tries.

Luisa will never be strong enough.

Isabela won't be perfect enough.

Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.

Bruno didn't care about this family.

He loves this family.

I love this family.
We all love this family.

You're the one that doesn't care.

The <i>encanto's</i> broken.

PEPA: What do we do now?

CAMILO: My powers. They're gone.

What about Antonio? What is he gonna do?

Mirabel?

Mirabel! Where's Mirabel?

Where is she?

Mirabel!

FÃ‰LIX: Mirabel?

Mirabel!

LUISA: Mirabel?

Mirabel!

FÃ‰LIX: Mirabel!

Mirabel!



(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

ABUELA: Mirabel.

(SNIFFS, CRIES SOFTLY)

I'm sorry.


I just wanted

to be something I'm not.


I've never been able to come back here.

This river is where
we were given our miracle.

Where <i>Abuelo</i> Pedro...

I thought we would have a different life.

I thought I would be a different woman.

(<i>DOS ORUGUITAS</i> PLAYING)

MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
<i>Two caterpillars</i>


<i>In love</i>

<i>Spend their nights and dawns</i>

<i>Full of hunger</i>

<i>They keep walking</i>

<i>And navigating the world</i>

<i>That changes and keeps changing</i>

<i>Navigating a world</i>

<i>That changes and keeps changing</i>

<i>Two caterpillars stop the wind</i>

<i>As they hold each other
with warmth and consent</i>

<i>Keep growing
They don't know when</i>

<i>To find some corner shelter</i>

<i>The time keeps changing</i>

<i>They are inseparable</i>

<i>And the weather keeps changing</i>


<i>Oh, caterpillars</i>

<i>Don't hold each other any longer</i>

<i>You must grow apart and return</i>

<i>That's the way forward</i>

<i>Miracles are coming</i>

<i>Chrysalises are coming</i>

<i>You must part</i>

<i>And construct your own future</i>

<i>Oh, caterpillars</i>

<i>Don't hold each other any longer</i>

<i>You must grow apart and return</i>

<i>That's the way forward</i>

<i>Miracles are coming</i>

<i>Chrysalises are coming</i>

<i>You must part</i>

<i>And construct your own future</i>

<i>Two caterpillars</i>

<i>Disoriented</i>

<i>In two cocoons</i>

<i>All bundled up</i>

ABUELA: <i>I was given a miracle.</i>

<i>A second chance.</i>

<i>And I was so afraid to lose it</i>

<i>that I lost sight
of who our miracle was for.</i>

<i>And I am so sorry.</i>

<i>You never hurt our family, Mirabel.</i>

<i>We are broken...</i>

because of me.

(MUSIC ENDS)

(HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

MIRABEL: <i>Abuela.</i>

I can finally see.

You lost your home.

Lost everything.

You suffered so much,

all alone,

so it would never happen again.

We were saved because of you.

We were given a miracle, because of you.

We are a family, because of you.

And nothing could ever be broken

that we can't fix... together.

I asked my Pedro for help.

Mirabel.

He sent me you.

(<i>DOS ORUGUITAS</i> PLAYING)

MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
<i>Oh, butterflies</i>

<i>Don't hold each other any longer</i>

<i>You must grow apart and return</i>

<i>That's the way forward</i>

<i>You are already miracles</i>

<i>Breaking chrysalises</i>

<i>You must fly</i>

<i>And find your own future</i>

BRUNO: She didn't do this! Whoa!

She didn't do this!

I gave her a vision!


I was, like, "Go!" And she was, like...

(BLOWS RASPBERRY) She only wanted to help.

I don't care

what you think of me, but if you're

-too stubborn to...
-(GASPS SOFTLY)

<i>Brunito.</i>

I feel like I missed something important.

Come on.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

What... What's happening?
Where are we going?

-(EXHALES) Home.
-(GRUNTS)

It's her! I found her!

I found her!

She's back! She's back, she's back!

JULIETA: Mirabel!

Mirabel!

<i>MamÃ¡.</i>

<i>Mi amor,</i> I was so worried.

We couldn't find you.

There were bees everywhere.

I'll be okay.

Uh... Not if we don't have a house.

What? We don't have a house.

I can't say we don't have a house?

What is that? Not a house.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Look at this home
We need a new foundation</i>

<i>It may seem hopeless
But we'll get by just fine</i>

<i>Look at this family
A glowing constellation</i>

<i>So full of stars
And everybody wants to shine</i>

<i>But the stars don't shine
They burn</i>

<i>And the constellations shift</i>

<i>I think it's time you learn</i>

<i>You're more
Than just your Gift</i>

<i>And I'm sorry
I held on too tight</i>

<i>Just so afraid
I'd lose you too</i>

<i>The miracle is not
Some magic that you've got</i>

-(GASPS)
<i>-The miracle is you</i>

<i>Not some Gift
Just you</i>

<i>The miracle is you</i>

<i>All of you
All of you</i>

<i>Okay so
We gonna talk about Bruno?</i>

<i>That's Bruno?</i>

<i>Yeah
There's a lot to say</i>

<i>About Bruno</i>

<i>I'll start, okay</i>

<i>Pepa, I'm sorry
About your wedding</i>

<i>Didn't mean to be upsetting</i>

<i>That wasn't a prophecy</i>

<i>I could just see
You were sweating</i>

<i>And I wanted you to know
That your bro loves you so</i>

<i>Let it in, let it out
Let it rain, let it snow</i>

<i>Let it go</i>

<i>That's what I'm always saying, bro</i>

<i>I got a lot of apologies I got to say</i>

<i>Hey, we're just happy
that you're here, okay?</i>

<i>-Come into the light
-That trip was only a night</i>

<i>And no matter what happens
We're gonna find our way</i>

<i>Yo, I knew he never left
I heard him every day</i>

(CHORUS VOCALIZING)


<i>What's that sound?</i>

<i>I think it's everyone in town</i>

ALL: <i>Hey</i>

<i>Lay down your load
Lay down your load</i>

<i>Roll me down the road
Roll me down the road</i>

<i>We have no Gifts
But we are many</i>

<i>And we'll do anything for you</i>

<i>It's a dream
When we work as a team</i>

<i>You're so strong</i>

<i>-Yeah, but sometimes I cry
</i>-BOTH: <i>So do I</i>

<i>I may not be as strong
But I'm getting wiser</i>

<i>Yeah, I need sunlight
And fertilizer</i>

<i>Come on
Let's plant something new</i>

<i>And watch it fly</i>

<i>Straight up to the sky</i>

<i>Let's go</i>

<i>The stars don't shine
They burn</i>

<i>The constellations glow</i>

<i>The seasons change in turn</i>

<i>Would you watch
Our little girl go</i>

<i>She takes after you</i>


<i>Hey, Mariano
Why so blue?</i>

<i>I just have
So much love inside</i>

<i>You know
I've got this cousin too</i>

<i>Have you met Dolores?</i>

Okay, I'll take it from here. Goodbye!

<i>You talk so loud</i>

<i>You take care of your mother
And you make her proud</i>

<i>You write your own poetry</i>

<i>Every night
When you go to sleep</i>

<i>And I'm seizing the moment</i>

<i>So would you wake up
And notice me</i>

Dolores, I see you.

-And I hear you.
-BOTH: Yes!

CHORUS:<i> All of you
All of you</i>

-Let's get married.
-Slow down.

CHORUS: <i>All of you
All of you</i>

<i>Home sweet home
I like the new foundation</i>

<i>It isn't perfect</i>

-<i>Neither are we
</i>-<i>That's true</i>

<i>Just one more thing
Before the celebration</i>

-<i>What?
</i>-<i>We need a doorknob</i>

We made this one for you.

ALL: <i>We see
How bright you burn</i>

<i>We see how brave you've been</i>

<i>Now see yourself in turn</i>

<i>You're the real Gift, kid
Let us in</i>

<i>Open your eyes</i>

(REPEATS IN SPANISH)

(IN ENGLISH) What do you see?

I see... me.

<i>All of me</i>

Their hunger burning</i>
