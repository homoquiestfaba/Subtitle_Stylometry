this whole forest chopped.

yeah,
maybe we should slow down,

go half speed.

what do you say, boss?

you go half speed,
i'll cut you half speed.

all i'm saying is,

it takes some time for these
big trees to grow back.

don't it?
trees are trees.

more people are building
houses now, closer together.

you look at your kitchen window,

you can look
in your neighbor's bedroom.

you take it from me, young man.

the future of this great country
is home ownership.

now, i want you guys
to get some rest tonight

'cause tomorrow we're gonna cut
20 acres of god's green timber.

when's this thing gonna be done,
elmer?

chow's ready boss.

the bone.

it ain't too bad.

much obliged, boss.

to take care of, boss?

you are late; if you are
trying to get on my good side,

you have failed.

now, get in line, happy hour.

hey, is that thing necessary?

well, you never know
who you might run into

in the deep, dark woods.

toe the line.

that means toes on the line.

(clears throat)

yes, this will include you,
wasted space.

toe the line.

now, you all have had
the good fortune

to be a part of the state's
first offender program,

what i like to refer to as
the get-out-of-jail-free card.

there's only one problem,
kiddies.

i'm the one
holding all the cards.

madam?

she'll be okay.
thanks.


(engine turning over)

(adventurous music)

â™ª

you're a cube rat, never spent
any time in the field.

not exactly.
i have an office.

nice refurbished couch,
a great one.

tea tray.

have you ever spent any time
outdoors?

i spend more time indoors.

got my master's in social work

with a focus
on criminal justice.

i don't remember asking
for your resume.

miss k., why are you here?

there's plenty of punishment
built into the system.

i'm here to reform, to help.

(chuckles)

well, shit, sam.
me too.

me too.

felony robbery.
chicken little.

you don't look the type.

wait a minute.
i know you.

internet hacker, stole, like,
12 mil from the government.

it was only 11.5.

the irs likes to round shit up.

what's it like
to spend all that money?

yeah, what did you buy?

never had a chance
to roll around in it.

just numbers on a screen.

you?

miss badass.
what?

assault a cop three times.

i dig it.

that's bullshit.

i only punched him once.

what about you, c.b.?

you doing all right back there?

need a drink?


nice.


s.t.u.m.p., remain seated
while the vehicle is in motion.

this is not a pleasure cruise.

s.t.u.m.p.s?

stupid teenagers
under my protection.

technically
they're not all teenagers.

(chuckles)

i'd appreciate it--

and i'm sure the other
passengers would too--

if you didn't smoke.

i'm not sure
i approve of your style.

well, then this is going
to get interesting.

(adventurous music)

â™ª

(twangy rustic music)

â™ª

(mysterious music)

â™ª

miss k., welcome to my world.

this is gonna be interesting.

s.t.u.m.p.s, get off the bus.

this is where we're staying?

this place is a pile.

(sighs)

s.t.u.m.p.s, toe the line.

you are all here
because you have made choices

that most people would describe

as piss-poor.

the courts have given you
this one last chance

to get your shit together,

or your shit
will get pushed in in prison.

(chuckles)

today you are all s.t.u.m.p.s,

but when i am through with you,

you will have grown
into trees...

and productive members
of society.

miss k.

hi.

we're gonna have a great week.

there will be
physical challenges

led by sergeant hoke,

and i'll be continuing
our counseling sessions here.

by the end of the week,
we hope this experience

inspires you to make changes
in your life

and better choices.

i choose to go somewhere else.

yeah, i don't want to stay
in that dump for a week.

shut it!

s.t.u.m.p.s don't stay
in the cabin.

s.t.u.m.p.s stay outside.

s.t.u.m.p.s, set up the tents
by the campfire circle.

move out.

hold on.

i'm not sharing a tent
with you.

oh, i know.
i'll be sleeping in the cabin.

what?

i'm not here
to share anything,

least of all hardships.

i may not have a fancy degree,

but s-g-t,

it's got its privileges.

(bear panting)

(bear roaring)

(bones crunch)


(flesh squishing)

several people got shot.

it was a drive-by.

the d.a. wanted me to testify,
but i couldn't.

i was worried for myra,
my daughter.

you have a daughter?
yeah.

whoa, serious m.i.l.f.-age.

(both laugh)

when i get out of here,
i'm gonna get her back.

hey, i cut a deal
to get out the bigger fish.

you got busted for talking.

talking's what saved my ass.

figures.

a hood rat like you
selling drugs.

hey, i had friends,
and they needed things.

just so happens
what they needed wasn't legal.

what you do differently
if you could go back in time?

probably invest in google.


trish, you're up.

(scoffs)

there was this bar fight.
cops showed up.

one of them asked me
what happened,

and the officer behind him
wouldn't stop staring at my ass.

(laughs)

so i popped him.

excuse me, ma'am,
but you do have a nice ass.

(laughs)

c.b., it's your turn.

i was coming back
from a party.

i was a little buzzed.

the car in front of me
ran this red light.

i couldn't stop in time,
and i hit him.

the driver got thrown
from the car.

you weren't hurt at all?

just a little cut on my knee.

the other driver
wasn't hurt either,

but he reeked of booze.

he was drunk too?

it was his third offense
for drunk driving.

oh.

he hit three cars in town

before he ran that light.

you stopped that guy
from killing someone.

you deserve--

you deserve a medal
rather than being here.

that's right.

the system is messed up.
it's not fair.

well, two d.u.i.s
don't make a right.

she did break the law.

screw that.
i would've hired a lawyer.

sued him for a million.

a million?
i would've got 12 million.

my lawyer said it was better
to just plead guilty

than to fight it.

and you thought
that was unfair.

he ran the light.
i was just a little buzzed.

nobody could've stopped in time.

i shouldn't be here.

no one thinks
they should be here.

hey, i'm glad you're all here.

we all have things
we keep inside,

stuff we don't want to share.

by the time we're finished,

i'm hoping we've all grown
into something

bigger than ourselves.

trees grow tall,
and then the trees fall!

what the--
but the river--

the river only goes one way.

sir,
this is a private meeting.

i'd appreciate it
if you'd moved on.

is he part of the program?

somebody grab the camera.

i think we just found bigfoot.

god damn it, s.t.u.m.p.s.

what in the name
of sweet lorraine

is going on out here?

oh, hello, meeks.
i thought i smelled you.

(laughs)

fire's a fire.
i'm just keeping warm.

that's all.

you got my invitation
to the party then.

oh, you know, that's funny,

'cause i didn't send you one.

now, i want you to clear out
of here

and stop interrupting
my angry sleep.

i've got this campground
for the next six days,

and that means six days,
i don't see you,

i don't hear you, and i sure as
hell don't want to smell you.

savvy?

yeah.

well, now,

we all got things
we want to hide,

and we all
just want to be wanted.


oh, and while
you're sleeping tonight,

all nice and cozy,

look out for them little--
them little critters,

because they like to find
a nice little warm spot

to crawl up into, you know--

(gibbers wildly)


jesus.

yahoo!


holy shit.

you just met
some of the local wildlife.

his name is meeks--
lives up here on the mountain.

pretty sure he's harmless.
pretty sure?

all right, everybody.
let's get back to the session.

no, no, no, session's over.

you s.t.u.m.p.s needs to get
some shut-eye.

0500 comes awfully early
in the morning.

5:00?
is he crazy?

move out, s.t.u.m.p.s.

let's go.

hit the hay.

5:00.

i don't even think my clock
has a five on it.

we'll continue this later.

good night, sister.

where have you been?
shh.

shut up and fuck me.

(chuckles)

there you go.

yeah.

(giggles)


(clears throat)

you've broken the first rule
of the camp.

if you do it again,
i have to write you up,

and that means you're gone.

here.
so, trish, out.

now.

thanks.


what happened?

you were snoring.

oh, sorry.

time to wake up
to the nightmare.

good morning, gentlemen.

drop your cocks
and grab your socks.

we're going on a hike!

another beautiful day
in paradise, chicken little.

i hope you enjoyed your
accommodations last evening.

compared to today,

it's gonna feel like
a five-star resort.

today we are going on a hike.
going off-road.

we're going to blaze
our own trail.

(knock on door)

wow, this is nice in here.

fire, mini fridge...

reading material.

and religion?

i'm shocked; you read.

it's just the next book
i throw on the fire.

and leave that behind?

without it.

(growls)

i'm gonna find a way
out of here.

nah, nothing exciting happens
in this small town.

what can i pour you, sheriff?

a little early, budd.

early?
that never stopped me.

dad.

he's on duty.

i'm just trying to make
the place a little profit.

wish you would've tried that
before you sold me this place.

oh--

say, mel,
didn't you have a cousin

who went to that
first offenders program

up there to cutter's peak?

that was a niece, yeah.

it's a pretty good program.
really helped her.

i just dropped c.b. off
up there today.

well, there's
this female counselor up there--

she seemed all right--
but what do you know

about this instructor,
this sergeant hoke guy?

abner hoke?
that guy's crazy.

he ought to be in jail.

he killed a kid up there
last year.

killed a kid?
are you serious?

yup.
they worked him to death.

hey, dad, can you go wait
on the other customers?

they already got fresh drinks.

are these fucking quarters
up there?

you're fucking cheating.

chill out.

no, i mean
the paying customers over there.

hello.

i'm going.
i'm headed that way.

relax.
just relax.

is that really what happened?
no.

look, a kid got heat stroke,

but, you know,
he had a heart condition

that no one knew about,
and he's okay now.

i'm sure c.b. will be fine.

yeah.

maybe you're right.

just being a little
overprotective, i guess.

just a little bit.

well, thanks, mel.
i'll see you around.

hey, ray.

why don't you stop by
after work and have a drink?

on the house.

you know, that's no way
to turn a profit.

oh.


if you can't keep up,
i'll leave you behind.

move out, s.t.u.m.p.s.

hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

on yourself!

now, i warned you.

he's mad as hell.

i ain't never seen him
so riled up.

wait a second.

we found this.
oh.

this is bad.

now, this is very,
very, very bad.

so tell us
what we're up against.

well--


i guess you heard
all that nonsense about him,

dragging his ax
and making the grand canyon

and his footprints
making the great lakes.

paul bunyan.

you're telling us
that's paul bunyan out there.

back in late 1800s,

there was a gentleman
by the name

of captain larch bunyan.

now, he was a lumber baron
in these parts.

he married this woman, helga.

she's new in town

and ain't nobody knew
from where.

well, helga,
she was ripe with child.

well, she gave birth

to this big,
giant bodacious baby.

the doctor said,

"well, this child
has a rare disease

or a rare blessing depending
on how you look at it.

"now, he's gonna be at least
twice as big

"as a normal man

"and gonna live
three times as long,

but he's always gonna have
the mind of a child."

of a child.

well, by the time
he was five years old,

he was six-foot-tall,
still growing.

now, young bunyan was working
the lumberyards here

in this area.

he was--he was bringing down
them big old oak trees

with just three whacks
of that ax.

of course all the competition
and everything

with the lumberjacks,
you know,

he won it all at the festivals
and the fairs and whatnot,

you know, hands down.

well,

you see, them lumberjacks
had cut down so many trees

that the food
was getting scarce.

animals were running off
to the high country.

now, at this particular camp,
this foreman bill and his men

were out hunting for a meal.

well, snow come early
that year,

and death was in the air.

now, the men
were following the tracks

of this wounded animal
through the snow,

and that's when they came upon
bunyan's beloved friend,

babe the blue ox.

now, babe had wandered off
and stepped himself

in a big bear trap.

he was maimed, and he was weak,

and he couldn't find
his way home.

but the loggers, they found him.

there he is,

up behind that bush.

what's he doing way up here?

he's lost.

no, he's dinner.

(babe roars)


oh, shit!

(guns cock)

back off.
i got him.


(babe roars)

foreman bill shot babe
right between the eyes,

killed him deader
than a dinosaur.

elmer, fire up the grill.
we're eating big tonight, buddy.

right, boss.

(indistinct chatter)

bunyan, he went out looking
for babe,

and he found him.

and of course, he was too late.

(growls)

the loggers had roasted up
babe's carcass,

and they were feasting on him
like he was a christmas dinner.

(growling)

no.

so when bunyan saw what
they did to his best friend--

well, the only friend
he'd ever had in whole world--

well, he just went berserk.

he just got that ax
and just sliced them,

every damn one of them
lumberjacks.

(screams)

he killed 10 if he killed 40.

whack! whack! whack!

(screams)

whack! whack!

(screams)

whack!
die!

whack! whack!

no!

whack!
why, he just made them kindling.

(screams)

foreman bill,

oh, he got the worst of it.

cut him such small pieces
that the coyotes had a hard time

trying to find something
to carry away.

when bunyan came to his senses,

he went and hid
until the snow melted,

and then he ran and he ran.

but the town-folk,
they hunted him down,

then caught up with him,

and they chained him up,

and they dragged him
through the town,

back through the streets
for everybody to see.

the town-folks,
they spit on him.

he was humiliated, embarrassed,
red-faced.

even maybelle,
who bunyan was sweet on,

she--she turned away.

(growling)

they dragged him
through the forest...

(screaming)

tossed bunyan
in an old mine shaft

loaded with dynamite.

one of them lumberjacks
lit a match.

(imitates fuse lighting)

ka-boom!


sealed that mine shaft forever.

well, then they made up
nonsense about...


paul bunyan, the lumberjack,

you know, so they can keep
the prosperity going.

you know?

well, memories fade.
people die.

people forget.

and you don't know when or who
or what happened back then.


i do.

i always knew.

that old mine shaft,
it couldn't hold him.

no, no, no, he escaped.

bunyan, he escaped.

he made his way up
into the mountains,

up into the high country,

and he took
babe's sacred remains with him.

and at the top of that mountain,

he made a shrine
to his only true friend.

bunyan lived there undisturbed,

and he grew and he grew
bigger, bigger,

alone, keeping to himself,

keeping away from civilization.

he had a pretty good life
up there,

that is, until you went
and fouled babe's grave site.

you desecrated the resting place

of bunyan's only friend.

so we're stuck here.

hey, ain't nobody going
no place

until you all put babe's horn
back where it belongs.

we're not going back
out there.

he'll kill us.

it's the only chance
y'all got.

(dramatic music)

â™ª

no, zack!

no, zack, come back!

here!
take it back!

this is what you want!

i'm the one who took it!

take it back!

and leave them alone!

zack, get in here now!

no, zack!

no, no!


(gargling)

(crying)

come on.
no!

get back.

no!

(growling)


no, please, i'm sorry.

no, no, no, no.


(crying)
no, no, no.

what are you doing?

i'm making something to eat.

i just lost another kid.

yeah, well,
i'm sorry for your loss.

that boy maybe just saved
all our hides.

well, got his horn back.

let him settle.

we get out of here first light.

i promised her
i was gonna pick her up

and get her from that place

and i was never
gonna leave her again.

of your dad being the sheriff.

i never told my dad
i loved him

before he dropped me off.

he knows,

and you're gonna get a chance
to tell him.

out of here?

yeah.

yeah, absolutely.

(breathing hoarsely)


sheriff tanner, come in.

yeah, go ahead, debbie.

to cutter's peak?

there was a reason
why bunyan saved you

and split some of your friends
like two halves of a peach.

you're the spitting image
of the little lady

that broke bunyan's heart.

(paper rustling)

1894.

what they would do to him

if they found him out there.

you know.
