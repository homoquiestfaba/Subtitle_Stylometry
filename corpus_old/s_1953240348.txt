You're right in. We'll see.

Would you talk to me?
It's about your film review.

Or whatever you want to call it.
"See it" is not a review.

That says it all.
It says almost nothing.

Stop it.
I do not understand you.

What do you want me to say?

Idiot? Well, it did you call me.

You've got a story.
Follow the money.

It was Glenn Ambers
who set it all in motion.

He pulled the trigger.
As a gun?

It's getting "misty" here.

"Tight lines."
Who talks like that?

Black coffee medium.

Additional cream, four pieces of sugar.

Thank you. See you tomorrow?

Hope to see you soon.
Have a nice day.

Can I help?
I'm looking for mr. Ambers.

Maybe I can help.
I do not want a trailer...

Motorhome.

We do not sell trailers.
We sell mobile homes.

Fair enough.

I am a journalist at Sundog Times
and will talk to mr. Ambers.

I'll see if he's there.

What is it about?

What are you talking about?

I'm writing an article
about people in the city.

He will be happy.
Mention his charity work.

He accepts you. Follow me.

Welcome.
I work for...

I know who you are.
You work for the school newspaper.

Do you get training in Ambers building?

The bears my name.
Is not your father's name?

We have dammit same name.

Come with your questions.
You're doing much charity work?

You bet on.

I support children, poor
and gay-all.

Do you support the water project?

Children in Kazakhstan
get food because of me.

Seriously? It's good.
I know.

It feels good to know
that children can eat their fill...

Only because I allow.

Do you write notes, take pictures
or record?

I remember it.
Remember it!

Have you seen deer mate?
No, I have not.

One must go further
long before the season begins.

You sit still and stare.

When males are ready to go.
Started...

They have an extremely focused
laser sight.

I filmed them.
What?

When deer mate.

Do you see that?

It arrived after mating Act.
But do not write about it.

I felt that I had to do it.
I owed the wild.

Have more questions?
It was shown everything.

Was that all? Will not you ask
about my amazing stuffed animals?

They are fine,
but it will be a short article.

Okay. Ambers with B was the name.

Well, says "it starts
be 'misty' here 'you something?

Misty?

Misty? No.

Thanks for everything.
You're welcome.

Piss and shit.

I wonder if people in fifth World...

...Ever do it.
They have children.

It makes everyone, even the Amish...

But do you think that they have time
to run solo numbers?

They're not porn?
How would they look at it?

Yes, they do not have
televisions or computers.

They have magazines.
They probably have a common Playboy.

As the leg cut Playboy
Suzanne Summers nipples out.

He walked around with them in his pocket.
It was almost a full year.

And Foster said
you had nipples in his pocket.

He was not happy.
No.

It was fun.
Suzanne Summers.

The guys in Zimbabwe hunt all day.
They have no free time.

Do you think that they have
some private places without lions?

You say nothing that is fact-based.

All guys do it as often as you.
Exciting. For them, I think.

You're a crazy bastard, Gunner.
No matter.

Fifth World countries? What is it?
There are many of them.

Do away from Soweto and live.

I'll give you Weto.

It's getting "misty" here

Will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

I would ask you the same question.
You must solve this.

It's on your conscience.
That shit is going to cost you.

Do you think it scares me?
Do you think that money is a problem?

I do not know, Glenn.
Apparently not.

It's going to cost you...

I do not know. $ 8000... at least.

A friend saw you up on the rock.

What are you doing there? Do you smoke?
Marijuana, I mean.

Or are you looking at the church as you
used to do with your father?

Do you see the irony of being biased
and looking at the church?

Have you been back to church?
Have you?

I do not need
to know that it is good for you.

They said that they would not have me.

They said that you could not proselytize.
It is not the same.

You should date.
I do my best.

What about the girl at the coffee shop?
I buy coffee. We are not together.

Invite her out.
Maybe.

I have ordered your robe
to the end. Extra large.

I'm not as great as you think.

You have the same size as your father.

He would be proud
to see you get your exam.

You're probably your exam in the spring?
Yes, I do.

The first in the family.

DELICIOUS blondes

Cross the hut.

Here you are. Thank you.

A coffee.

Medium coffee, additional cream,
four pieces of sugar.

Coming soon.

Why ignored me, Ben?
I bought just coffee.

Lately you have
always bought coffee for me.

You have seen something, right?
On the net.

How did you find it? It is well
not up under my name?

It was an accident.
Slipped you over your computer?

So you're just like everyone else
Mormon guys in this town.

Wait, I'm not like that.

You are so beautiful
and I tried to talk to you.

I do not know...
I do not.

What did you mean by Mormon guys?

I have been dating a few.
I'm a Mormon.

I guess I'm a Mormon who you are.
I do not go to church.

Treated the you bad?
They could not handle my past.

What you saw.
Were they gay?

It is out there for all eternity.
I can not change it.

I have nightmares about
that my future children will find it.

You do not go down on his knees.
What?

Invite me out, Ben.

Shall we go together?

If you do not call
I am inclined arsenic in your coffee.

I'm calling.

I promise.

What can I do for you, Benjamin?
Jeep sounds strange.

Your brake hose is cut.

Maybe I have run on a stone.
You have used a knife.

Can you fix it?
Yes, but find out who is behind them.

If it was a joke, burn the lawn of.
If it was for real, burn the house.

I can help you if you want.
You mean it. Maybe later.

I support you if you need me.

Where are you going?
I do not know. Cafe Rio?

Find a place with table service.

Chili's?
Find a slightly better place.

Hey.

You look gorgeous.
Thank you.

I've never been here.
I have not.

Do you live not in St. George?
Everyone takes their baldates with here.

But I was never to prom.

What have you done?
It was something with art teacher.

Welcome to Painted Pony.
Will you hear about today's special menus?

Can we get a little more time?

What the hell...

Do you like it here?
I do not know much about art.

Surprisingly, when you busted
arts teacher.

I do not know much about art,
but it reminds me of my hometown.

I must get some sleep.

I drop you.
Clear.

You do not follow me to the door.
It should I do.

As you will.

Good night.

Ben.

See you tomorrow? I have coffee ready.
Absolutely.

Hello?

Ben Banks, you will be taken care of
Ã  la Timmons.

Now I have fun.

It smells heavily here.

The show is over, friends.

It was crazy.

Sweet. "I love beaver".

Hello, mr. Bong.

What is this?

What is it? It is a condom.

Who wants to celebrate with Greg?
Grabber all.

Then there is the celebration.

The mission fuldf...

Stone Temple Pilots. Seriously.
A collection of idiots.

Are you working on a story?
Glenn Ambers.

Got a tip?
Something about the water pipe lines.

Did you ask him about it?
In a way.

In a way? How can you ask
about something in a way?

Do you eat a sandwich in a way?
Or are you virgin in a way?

Are you a man in a way?

How can you ask in a way?

I interviewed him and he
talked about his charity...

And weird things he does with deer.

I asked some questions.

You may get a little backstory...

From environmentalists on pipelines
and then pressing the Amber.

You need to ask him questions.
Right questions.

If you do, you get the point
although it is not an article.

Seriously?
In a way.

How do you know all the girls from?
From school.

Did you go all the way
with her the delicious?

She is different.

That's what you said
about the previous one.

It was expected.

What do you think?

His ex-girlfriend's favorite movie was
"Bridges of Madison County".

When one says something like that you show
who you are.

His girl loved the movie.

What is your favorite movie?
"Schindler's List". And you?

"Pulp Fiction".
"Lebowski".

What's wrong with "The bridges
in Madison County? "It's good.

The entire film, as his ex
thought was so romantic...

Is about a married woman
as fuck with a stranger.

He's onto something.

It's about a housewife
whose husband wears like a horse...

To support the family.

He is tired, but believe that the wife
take care of everything while he works.

The only thing she orders
is Clint Eastwood in the bathtub.

She loved the movie.

Who do you think you were?

You were the husband.
And she was unfaithful.

No more to say.

Shit.
What is it?

It's my boyfriend's favorite movie.

Stop.
I'm sorry.

I can not help that she likes something.

I go to bed.

You can not. We have more incense...

And to see "There Will Be Blood".
We have not seen milkshake scene yet.

Shit.

No, Grandma.

What did you say?

Where is my sock?
I do not know.

Sorry I did not come this morning.

I was out late with my friends
and slept over me. That's it.

Do you have a hangover?

I act like a slut
from "High School Musical".

Are you busy now?
No.

It is said that you smoking up on the rock
every night. Is it true?

I'm free in an hour.
Will you show me?

Like. I'll pick you up in an hour.

What is your favorite movie?
It is clear "Say anything".

Cool.
Okay.

I like the streets are as in a grid.

I'm from Boston. The streets are made for
horses or by drunken soldiers.

From Boston? Dad loved the Celtics.
If he came from Massachusetts?

No, but he loved Dave Cawlings
and all other Mormons in the Celtics.

Players like Danny Inks.
Is he still crazy about them?

He died when I was 18 years old.
I'm sorry, Ben.

It's okay.
It's been a while ago.

Drill your mother here?
I would like to meet her.

We can arrange.
What about your parents?

We're not talking so much together.

I rebelled against the family.

I moved to Vegas with a friend to...

I do not know what the plan was.

How did you end up here?
I did not like myself in Vegas.

I figured with a lower risk of
people would recognize me from the net.

People say that I take up here and will
high.

Is that your thing?
No.

What will you be doing?

I want to be a journalist
and writing articles.

Can you give marijuana for it?
I think so.

Are not you afraid of being caught?
Someone could see you.

No one sees me.
I see 100 meters in all directions.

What if someone climbs up?
It does not happen.

I have made it even worse.
I'm not super worried.

So you will continue to smoke here?
Does it bother you?

I'm just saying what I've heard.
People say that you're a pothead.

I say they do not know you.
Do you?

Not yet.

But I've seen you at the cafÃ©.
You are a good person.

Do you sense it in the way
I order coffee on?

No, I see it in your eyes.

I'm working on an article and should
check something. I'll be back.

Mother always said that I have hair
and soul like a lion.

Shit, look who's here.

Mr. Ambers recorded.

More questions about charity?
He does not want to meet you.

Is not he busy?
He does not want to meet you.

Remember when environmentalists
demonstrated here?

The vile people.
Created the problems of Ambers?

Is it a crime
to mr. Amber likes to hunt?

Or think everyone should have enough water?
It does not sound like a crime.

Have you heard him say
"It starts to get 'misty' here '?

Misty? No. Well, maybe. No.
What would you say?

I think that one of the traits under
called a girl for Misty.

Nickname for Melissa.
Thank you. You were a great help.

Okay, asshole. Tight lines.
What did you say?

I said:
"Okay, asshole. Tight lines."

Clear.

Cross the shed.

Saved you feel all the time?

It seems to miss the cat out of the bag.

Why put you a cat in a sack?
Damn, Ambers.

I've never heard
someone put a cat in a sack.

I like cats.
I'm in! And you put them in bags.

It's a figure of speech.
I should have got it.

Clear you put cats in bags.
I'm taking the rest of the day.

I have a clue.
As in the movie?

Just like in the movies.

Melissa... Melissa Brady. She is part
of an environmental activist group.

Dixie Green.
Could it be her?

Call her.
How do I get her number?

Are you kidding? You can do anything
online than to check girls out.

Seriously? Like what?
Fucking fun.

Here it is.

I'm looking for Melissa Brady.

Is it true? What?

No, I did not. Thank you.

BofÃ¦llen said that she has been away for
more than one month.

It sounds sinister.
Yes.

Can it wait until tomorrow?
I think so.

It was not meant to be.
Slid you? It's leather.

Sorry.

Do you always fast forward
or is it because of my movies?

What do you film?
Very funny.

Seriously.
What you saw.

I saw pictures of you.

I thought...
Which film?

I thought you knew.
Which film?

You know what movie I mean.
With other guys?

Do not look at me like that.
I did not know...

I thought you knew.

We seen enough any more.
Wait.

I've seen that look before.
You do not know what I was thinking.

Yes, I do.
I see it in your eyes.

Benny Banks.
Are you good?

Hank mushrooms. Are you with me?
Yes.

My legs feel happy.
Cool.

I have the world's happiest legs.
Lykkeben.

Can you really run now?
I am prof

Where is your girlfriend, Gunner? Does she
"Bridges of Madison County"?

Give her a honk.
Okay.

Honk.

Gunner said to have grass.
When we arrive.

Where are we going?

What the hell.

What are you doing?
I saw a guy.

What's wrong with you?

What are you doing?

There have kept a car very long
with the lights on.

Benny!

Where is the driver?

Shit.

A guy has shot himself.

I want to go home, Gunner.

How could I ports in this?
I'm calling the police.

I just wanted to smoke a little grass.
Eternity never ends.

Eternity never ends.
What the hell are you talking about?

You must come back to reality.

The police are on their way.
We must get away from here.

We are affected.
There is a dead body over there.

We must away. We are affected.

We're not going anywhere. They turn not
back to something. Relax.

There is a dead body over there.

There is a dead body over there.

There is a man who and he is dead.

I stopped him.
Is there really a corpse?

There is a dead body there.

Oh god.

An equal.
Pull yourself together.

I need to see your ID
and ye shall be here.

I want to go home.
Wrong place, wrong time.

I need reinforcement.

Ben?

What is it? Sit.

We found a dead guy.
What?

He had shot himself.
Oh, my goodness.

Why did he do it?

Going it, Benny?
Yes.

Thank you.

You do not know me,
but I knew your father.

He bought it for your tenth anniversary.
I can save it for a few months...

And then you can buy it back
for the same sum.

I can not...
Your father was a good man.

Thank you.

Do not touch the works.
I will buy it.

It is a very expensive work.

Can you pack it in?

Yes?

Is Amy home?
She had to close her bank accounts.

Who are you?
Her sponsor... girlfriend.

Will you give her this?

Who is it from?
Tell Ben came up with it.

I make sure that she gets it.

"Dear Mom and Dad.
I did it because of you."

"You do not love me and I can
not live with. This is your fault."

Never take mushrooms again. I stared at
myself in the mirror for an hour yesterday.

No, grandma! Nice beard.

I feel you there. Get out.

I tried to smoke a little,
but it was not good either.

Have you thought about
why the guy shot himself?

Stop, I get headaches.
Forget it.

Are we smoking on?
No, I must continue.

Think that I found him.
You knew him?

I will not speak ill of the dead,
but he was a pig.

How were his parents?
They were saints.

They accepted just all the shit
as their son came up.

Was he frequently in trouble?
He took all the drugs he could.

He tried to make amphetamine
in a broom closet.

If he claims that he did it
because of the parents...

I heard that there was no letter.
No letter.

Pigs. Who kill themselves without
explain why the parents?

What is she doing here?

What the hell.

Damn, man!

May I come in?
I do not understand you bought it for me.

I felt like shit.

Are you moving?
Everyone has a past.

They have something they want to forget,
but it is not as well documented as mine.

I was so naive.

I knew nothing about drugs,
alcohol or something.

My parents had not told me something.

You have to just try one more time.
Do you have that way about marijuana?

That's why I asked so much.

I just can not with something.
I understand.

I was addicted...

And a guy said that he knew
how I could make a quick buck.

It was four weeks of my life.

Four weeks that I will never forget.

It does not bother me anymore.
Do not lie to me.

I can reconcile myself with it. All
conditions have something in their luggage.

It's out there forever.
It will always be there.

It's not something that you just have
heard of. You can see it.

You might have already.
I would not do.

Both you and I know that it's there.
I just pretended like it was not there.

Should not we try to let it go?

I do not want
you to reconcile you with anything.

I will not go.
I'm asking you.

I saw you with him.
With him there Timmons.

I think you have problems.

Was it blackmail with Melissa Brady?
I would say "misty" to Ambers.

He thought of Melissa Brady
and was afraid.

I do not have the whole story,
but sufficient to Spectrum.

"School Sheet blackmailed
local businessman."

You chose the loser without ambition,
but you chose wrong.

I've seen tons of movies.
You can not go to the Spectrum.

Maybe I contact the police also.
Please do not leave it.

Tell what happened.

Misty... Melissa gave Ambers headache
with its protests.

He asked Greg to fix it.
He would scare her.

Greg pretended that it went very wrong.

He told Ambers
he buried her in the desert.

And I blackmailed him?
Not my idea. I love him.

Timmons? Are we talking about the same guy?
Judge me not.

Okay, but I will still contact Spectrum.

It will destroy me.

It's sad, but you may end here.

It's your own fault. I'll try
to keep the police out.

What should I do?

Where is Misty?

A person?
Hold it.

What is it?

How.

No,.

Keep it. It is the daily newspaper.

A story that attack a competitor
even a school magazine, must be waterproof.

It is waterproof.
You may get a response from Ambers.

He must be given the
opportunity to comment.

He probably will not talk to me now.

It does not he. It is probably
If he says "no comment".

Can I write this article?
Brings we get points.

I'll get a response from Ambers.

I knew you were here.

The police will ask more questions
the guy who killed himself.

Now?
Yes. Hank and Gunner is already there.

I believe that we must agree
to keep our rights.

What's with him?
Gone with the girl, she made porn.

Something of a turn.
What is the problem?

The thought of all the guys...

Holy crap.
What?

You look at a lot of porn.

She would not do it
if there were guys like you.

We buy it all together.

It's not the same.
Yes.

Although it does not bother me,
is it her that it is online.

I know you hate it
when I become religious.

You have never been religious
to us or anyone else.

You know the story in the Bible about the men
Taking the incredible girl to Jesus...

Because they want to smash her head
with stones.

A loose minutes. You believe that, as is
without guilt should throw the first stone.

It's cool that one should not judge,
because we all have done shit.

That's not the point.
I do not know if I want to hear it.

After Jesus said it
Yesterday the men home...

Because they've all stolen
bread at a time.

Jesus asks the girl where guys
which would shatter her went.

She then says that they went home.

He says that she must live on
and not do it again.

I'm with. He forgives her.
No, you're not.

It's not just a guy which forgives a girl.

It was Jesus. He dies on the cross
the girl's sins.

It is no matter.
He will suffer for her sake.

What does he do? He judges her? No.

He's getting it.

If he can get it, you can also do it.

I've never thought about it that way.

We do not go to church anymore
but I just wanted to say it.

I assume that the problem is
it is available.

The films can be found on the net.

Find out who owns it
and ask them to remove it.

Can I do it?
I do not know.

But she is not a big star.
Maybe you can.

I must go.
Tell the police that I'll call you later.

What? I know the Bible.

Okay. Thank you.

Damn.
What happens?

I have found the company behind the website,
but not who owns it.

You know that Mary Andrews live here?
Who is it?

Ex-porn star. "Your Kissin '
Cousin 3 "and" Leave It In, Beaver."

Remember when Ronnie tried to
sell them to you at school?

Does she live in St. George?
I saw her on HARMAND's.

She was one of the first who had
its own website.

She won some awards for the page.
Maybe she can help you.

How do we find her?
I actually know where she lives.

How do you know?
I googled and followed her.

Okay.

Yes?
Mary Andrews?

Not anymore.
Now my name is Mary Shepard.

What is it about?

It is about a girl I'm happy
order. I need your help.

We were just about to eat breakfast.

The Gilded Unicorn.
Do you know who owns the company?

Yes, and I understand your girlfriend.

I tried to get some of my
material from them.

It's not nice people.
I will make an attempt.

The chief executive of living in Vegas.

I see if I can find the address.
Is enough in our legal documents.

Thank you.

What's wrong with you?

I looked at her naked body since I was 16

Pull yourself together.

Here it is. Do not expect too much,
if you get to meet him.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I show them off.

Do you love the girl?
Yes.

Then you must do what it takes.
Give the bastard what he deserves.

Does the car as it should?
Yes, but I need your help.

Trays me up?
Is it about time?

It's time now.

Yes?
Where's Phil Macy? We next meeting.

Stay there, fatty.

I thought you kept an eye on the door.

Are you in the right place?
What's with this guy?

You want something to drink?

My name is Ben Banks and want
Amy Warner films.

Hi, Ben Banks.
I know of no Amy Warner.

He thinks Cherry Thighs.
It was sad that she stopped.

Can we find a solution?
Can I buy them from you?

Is this your wife?
I'm with you love her.

You do not guys look when she
fucks with other guys...

And girls too, I think.
I know what you're thinking.

What I do makes a difference
and saves lives.

Men need.
Strong pulsed needs.

Enough is enough!

For me to have my freedom, must
I accept what you do with yours.

But do not pretend that you do
is good. What you're doing is miserable.

If you do not give my friend
what he asks for...

I come back and get seriously hurt.

Thank you. I do not know if it helped,
but I owe you one.

Tell if he does not give you that.
You have done enough.

Benjamin, you must tell.

Bank.

I knew I'd find you
here. What are you doing?

I want to talk to Amber.
You're an idiot.

Now you are suddenly motivated.

Why were you not when I cut
brake hose on your car?

Or when I searched your apartment?

Yes, it was me.
I found this little number.

I've already used two.
I wish I had snatched five.

The meat pie in your fridge is old.
Throw it out.

It's no use.

I have a question for you.

Do you think you can take my ass,
Ben Banks?

How dare you interfere with my
Breakfast? How did you get in?

Timmons, you're fired.
What is it?

Melissa Brady. Your right hand
Timmons blackmailing you.

She lives. She was not killed.

Misty was in it.
Are you sure?

Check the date. I met her
two days ago in Salt Lake.

I owe you one.
What can I do for you?
