You have to say something.

What are people going to say?

I don't care what people say.

Look, you asked me to
come, and I'm here.

Just gonna pay my respects.

That's all I need to do.

No matter what problems
you had, we are a family!

He was your...
I'm sorry, ma.

I'm not speaking.

He probably would've
wanted it this way.

Ladies and gentlemen,
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D."

Can I get it, can I
get, can I get an amen!

Can I get a hallelujah!

One more hand for
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D"!

Yeah!

You told me they were
good, but I didn't know

they were that good.
Glad you came, man?

Yeah, glad to be here.

Told you this is good.

This is good.
Amazing!

Hey, hey, hey everyone.

Hey.
I wanna introduce you all

to Royce London.

Those are my sons
Blaine and Camden.

Blaine runs the Young Men's
Ministry I told you about.

Mm-hmm.
And these young people,

Amber, Akil, Dawn.

Well, they've been members of
the church since they were,

when, the children's choir?

Mm-hmm.
Oh.

Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you all.

I have not heard singing
like that in a while.

Oh!
You actually remind me

of when I first got started.

The name of your group,
what's it stand for?

God Is Faithful
Today and Every Day.

Amen. Amen.

Now what y'all did tonight,
was that an original?

Yeah, actually, my
brother wrote it.

He writes all of our stuff.

Yeah.

You got more songs like
that in your repertoire?

Yes! Yes!

Well, I got to tell
y'all, y'all got something

people would wanna hear.

This right here? This is
a million dollar sound.

You should give me a call.

I'd love to hear
more of your music.

If you're ever in
Atlanta, look me up.

Thanks. I will.

Yeah well, you
know, we're gonna...

We'll reach out, right?

Well, thank you.

Thank you for letting
me worship with you.

It was a blessing.

I'll see you too.
Bye!

Told you!

Don't worry. Like,
eh, eh, eh eh.

Really, I didn't see it.

Yeah.
I didn't notice.

I know my father.

He was not okay with it.

So, what d'you think
he's gonna say?

It'll start with, "I'm
really disappointed in you."

And then it'll end with, "I'm
really disappointed in you."

Well,

if he had any sense,

he would say that you showed
great leadership tonight.

And,

for once,

it would be about
what Godwanted,

not your father.

Hey! I'm proud of you.

Uh. We shouldn't.

Yeah, you're right.

Or we could skip dinner, and...

I thought we were
trying to wait 'til...

'Til marriage?

Are you gonna let me in
on when that's gonna be?

Your mom is taking me dress
shopping this weekend.

She said it's just for fun.

And she wants to dress me
up like a matrimony Barbie.

She's more ready for me to
walk down the aisle than you.

Dawn, when the time is right...

But I want you now!

I want you too.

But I also respect you,

and love you.

And we made a promise to
God and to each other.

And we're gonna wait.

When the time is right.

Really? You just got in, bro.

Trina ain't tired of you yet?

Man, I don't know about Trina,

but Danielle can't get
enough of your boy.

Don't wait up.

Like I ever do, bro.

Like, what?

You forgot your keys?

Dad!

Why are you...

What happened tonight,

better not ever happen again.

You hear me?

Showboatin' for,
for Royce London!

I wasn't.

Of course you did.

That's my church!

You hear me?

You play what I
tell you to play.

And you do what
I tell you to do!

Don't you ever cross me again.

Boy...

Oh.

Dad.

So Cam, you'll update your dad

on all the talking points then?

Yes. Ma'am. I'll let him know.

The foundation would also
like for the entire family

to stick around
for a group photo

with the volunteers after
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" performs.

Yes, of course.

Great.

I will give them a call and
follow up with the caterers.

Is there anything
else, First Lady?

Oh no, Regina. Thank you.

Oh, just update the rest of the

fundraising committee for me.

You got it.
Thank you.

Baby?

You okay? You look tired.

Yeah. Late night, just
working on some new songs.

Oh, workaholic, just
like your daddy.

He stayed overnight studying
in his office again.

Oh, thank you.

You two reminded me so
much of him on Sunday.

You may be too
young to remember,

but he used to sing
before his sermons.

Oh, I fell in love
with that voice

the first time I heard him
sing, "Jesus Loves Me".

And the man, ooh!

He was so fine.

Momma, what!

Nasty!
Come on, Ma!

You was lusting over Daddy

in the pulpit like that?
Oh, boy!

Hush!

Come on!

Hush your mouth.
Meet you later.

I'm just saying', you
still fine, Mama.

I'm just, I'm just
playin', I'm just playin'.

Hmm.

And you just as fine with
your pretty brown eyes.

Alright, bro.
Alright, bro.

So...

I have lunch plans
with Dawn this weekend.

You mean shoppin' plans?

Well, if I wanna
have grandchildren

I have to take things
into my own hands.

Ma!

I don't know what you and
your brother are waiting on,

and you're not getting any
younger, and neither am I.

It's time for you
to settle down.

Mom!

It's all about the right time.

You know we...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

It's all about the right lady.

Now your brother is
all over the place

but you at least have
an honest prospect.

And if you wait too long,
you're gonna miss out.

I know you have
responsibilities, so do I!

But constantly covering
for you not showing up

shouldn't be one of them.

So I missed your little meeting.

Oh, don't do that!

I will make the next one.

You promised me no matter what,

that you would
prioritize home first.

I am sick of you
putting the church

and herbefore me!

I didn't sign up for that.

After all these years...
You know what I do.

You know when I'm not here I
am taking care of business.

Try to expand while keeping
us and the church afloat.

Yes, I know what you do.

And you need to figure
out a better way,

because if you don't...
Rita.

I need you to show up for us!

Billy. I need you to be
what I need you to be!

I am more than your
party planner

and your little organizer.

I am your wife, and
you will respect me!

And you will put
your family first!

I mean it!

I've been doing
a lot of thinking

and effective today,
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" will be

the official praise
team of the church.

Camden. I am making you
the minister of music.

Well, we already have
a minister of music.

Things change, and
it's gonna be great.

You're gonna write
original music,

songs your brother
will lead of course,

maybe record a few albums.

Next thing you know
we'll be adding services

because of everyone wanting to

worship with
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D."

Bro, this is a good thing.

Congratulations man, the
group's gonna be hyped.

Just gotta write me a
couple of solos. All right?

So what is it?

Hmm? I thought you'd be happy?

More responsibility.

More control?

God is in control.

The question is,

are you willing to
surrender your will for his?

I am.

You know, music is all
I ever wanted to do

and to do it for you like this?

Thanks Dad.

I know I fought you for
choosing music over the pulpit.

My dad had me make that choice

and I truly learned
believing that

obedience is better
than sacrifice.

Amen.

But, son, I,

I do believe
that you are gifted.

And if it's your
time, it's your time.

Oh my God, Blaine just told
me, babe, this is huge!

Congratulations!

What's wrong?

Just doesn't feel right.

Your father supporting you?

Yeah. That part.

You're thinking
too much into it.

I think this is just your father
giving you the recognition

you've always wanted, the
recognition you deserve.

Relax babe. Enjoy your moment.

Come on, come on
this is big, come on!

You're supposed to be
excited about this.

All right, okay.

This is so exciting.

More "SO G-I-F-T-E-D",
yes, please!

Oh, this year's choir

anniversary is going
to be monumental.

I am so proud of my babies!

This is truly a celebration.

Oh, and Camden.

You are going to change
the face of music.

Cam-deezy.

And my son Blaine,

he's gonna change
the face of gospel.

Mm-hmm.
When he pastors

the Church of Houston for me.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, I didn't realize you
finalized plans, Dad.

When you openin' it?

Oh, it'll be at least
a year from now.

I'm gonna start with online
services weekly from here,

and then Blaine, he's gonna move
to Houston and run it all.

Praise the Lord.

Both of our sons walking
into their destinies.

Amen.

Dad, I am not ready, man.

And what about the group?

What about it? Hmm?

Hey, you can keep singin'.

A lot of pastors
sing, and do well.

Yeah, but, don't I have to
go to seminary school first?

I trained you for this, Blaine.

The word is in you, son.

But, that's the least
of your worries.

It is,

it is time for you
to settle down.

Hedid findeth a wife.

Wait, whoa, wait,
Dad, Dad, a wife!

Wait, what!?

What are you talking about?

What about Amber? Huh?

Oh, my God!

Well she, she's lovely.

And a singing
First Lady has great appeal.

No, Amber, Dad!

No, Dad, marriage is
the very last thing

that's on my mind.
No-one's gonna trust

a single pastor, okay?

So, we have to have
a solid foundation

as we go into Houston,

as we start...
No, Dad, Dad, Dad.

Didn't you say
it'll take a while

before I took over
the new church, right?

I just wanna focus on my music.

This is not a request.

You need someone
solid, reliable.

You need someone you
can marry within a year.

A year!

A year! A year!

What about your mother's
assistant? Regina?

Dad! What?

Hmm. Her father, and her
grandfather were pastors.

You two, you
would be Christian royalty!

Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,

not her please!

I already...
She's the one!

She'll be great.

She'll be great.

Trust me.

I trust you.

I trust you.

Are you serious?

What?
I don't wanna marry you!

You're trash!
Wow!

You cheated on me
with my best friend.

Yo, Gina, I apologized for that.

Why are you trying to
live in the past for?

Live in the past?

The last thing I said
to you was that I

never wanna speak to you again

and you come to with
this, a proposal?

No!

Listen, just stop, just stop.

It's a proposition, okay?

One that could
benefit you and me.

Look, Psalm 13 says...

Man, I swear you
start spewing out

your biblical psycho bull.

My faith actually
means something to me.

Your faith? Really
means somethi...

Your faith means
something to you? Really?

Come on, don't do that.

That, was a mistake.
Oh wow!

-Okay, you were a mistake,
-Okay.

And this, could be
an epic mistake!

Look, it's all my
dad's idea, all right?

Gina, I know you can't stand me.

And to be honest, I
really can't stand you.

But look, together, we can
build a young mega church

unlike anything Houston's
ever seen before!

A strong music ministry.

A strong women's
ministry led by you.

And ran through by you?

You see, I can't even...

Crazy.

The way you cast the vision

you sound just like your father.

My father is a good man,
and he believes in me.

Hmm.
Gina, he believes in us.

We could do this!

Okay.

Thank you.

How many stacks?
Excuse me?

I mean, you're asking
me to be one half

of a loveless marriage
for the sake of a church.

I think a check is an order.

You know, the
harvest is plentiful

but the laborers...
So it's like that?

Just like that.

Let me just talk to my father,

all right?
No.

I'll talk to your father.

Pastor Wilson and I
speak the same language.

So, does that mean you're in?

We'll see.

â™ª Blessed assurance

â™ª Jesus is mine

â™ª Oh what a foretaste

â™ª Of glory divine

â™ª Heir of salvation

â™ª Purchase of God

Hey!

Hey, Royce. How are you?

I'm not used to
waiting for folk.

Now, I love that
song you guys sung

when I came to visit, you
know, "Born to Worship."

Well, I'd also
love to put that song

on one of my compilation albums.

Who knows? Could turn
into a record deal.

Now, as soon as that song drops

I put you guys out
on my labels tour.

How would you feel about
coming out to Atlanta?

I'd love to bring you out
here for a few months.

A few months?

You know, we need
to collaborate.

We need to work on some music.

Is that a problem?

-No, no, I-I-
-I mean, if you need

some time to think about
it just let me know.

I don't...

Yeah. I'd love to.

Just let me talk to my dad.

Understood.

Well, hit me back, we'll
work on the details.

Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

Big BZ in the house!

Why you hatin' bro?

Why you hatin' bro?
Big Beezy though?

Big BZ.

You can retire that one.
A'ight, fine.

Where you been?

Oh, I was with dad
at the old building.

Oh.
You know,

Trini might've been
there with Big Beezy.

Anyway.

Guess who I got off
the phone with bro.

Who?

Royce London.

Okay.

He wants us to record a song

on his new record
label's project

and go on tour with him.

And go on tour?
Yeah.

No, no, no, no bro, this
is for real, for real?

Yeah.

We're about to record
with a major label.

Yeah.
And go on tour!

Yeah.
No, you're not hearing tour

the way I'm hearing.

Camden, do you,

No, no, you're not.

Do you know what a tour means?

I feel you!

No, do you understand how
much sexy and sanctified tail

we gonna get on this road, boy?

Oh man. Evil.

I'm sayin'.

And, after we do
the single his album

we shoot the music video.

Nah, nah, we do the remix.
The remix will be better.

What's going on? What's wrong?

He also wants me
to go to Atlanta

and write some songs for him.

Okay. For how long?

A few months.

I mean, see how you gonna
record the single and be here?

How are you?

I mean, I'm gonna
record the single here

but then I gotta go.

Hold on.

So you're going to Atlanta to
get away from Dawn and Dad?

I'm confused.

I thought you were the
one leaving us behind?

-Well, I thought too-
-To run your

big church in Houston.

Well, I thought you
were gonna come with me!

How am I gonna do that?

Dad has me running
his music ministry.

Wow!

Now I see what it's about, bro.

I see it clear now man.

Cam, this whole time you
want to be the star, man.

Come on. That's you dog.

I just wanna make music.

Do you not see this?

Do it here.

They have your favorite.

Do it here!

If Royce was calling you
to come work instead of me,

would you settle
for staying here?

All right.

You know, it's gonna be
the first time that we...

I know.

I know.

Well, we always knew your music

would take you around the world.

Just, you know, don't forget

to get my foot in the
door when it's time

for Big Beezy's album.

So how you gonna tell...
Dad?

I'll figure it out.

Not bad, Cam.

So that's it, you're going?

Did you even think about
taking me with you?

Do you wanna go?

No Cam, I want you
to want me to go.

So what does this mean for us?

Is this a part of your
perfect one-year plan

or do you just wanna
put this on hold

until you finish pursuing the
next stage of your career?

Why? You wanna see other people?

No, but I don't
wanna be left behind!

God, I just want
you to fight for us!

Look, I'm just taking
a temporary job

to launch my career

and all you or anyone
else can think about

is how it affects you.

What about me?

What about what I want?

I thought you wanted me.

I do.

But not more than you want
this opportunity with Royce.

I love you and I love music.

Why are you trying
to make me choose?

Come on, you don't
have to leave.

No, you don't have to leave!

Who am I to stand in your way?

Dawn!

Before I get into
the word today,

I wanna share some of
the wonderful things

the Lord has been
doing in this house!

Now some of y'all have been
with us from the very beginning,

and you have seen my family

grow up right before your eyes!

Hmm!

And, as you see,

we have recently
installed Camden

as minister of music.

Amen!
Amen!

Hey, yeah, hey yeah!
Go Camden, go Camden!

Huh, huh!

And, and,

in the very near future,

we are going to witness

Blaine walk into his destiny

as the pastor of our first

satellite church in Houston!

Huh! How about that?

How at that?

Ah-ha, son!

Give me your hand.

Give me your hand
and come forth.

That's right.

Come forward my son, because,

I am gonna pray an
Elijah prayer over you,

as I pass the ministry mantle.

So, turn around, uh-huh.

Face it, face it young
man, young man.

Come on, come, come,
come on, come on.

Amen!
Yeah! Amen!

Bring your stuff.

All right, all right, all right.

Now, now, I don't
know about y'all,

but I hear that God...

is gonna perform

some awesome miracles
through this ministry!

Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

Like he did in the
days of Elijah!

Hmm?

Bring my oil, bring
my oil, bring my oil.

Now, Elijah passed
the mantle down

at the end of his
ministry. Hmm?

I'm gonna say it again. I
don't think y'all hear me.

He passed the mantle down
at the end of his ministry.

But I, I bestow the magic

to you at the height...

At the height, all right
come on, can you her me?

At the height of my ministry!

Hmm? All right!

So, may God bless you, son.

And may God keep you, son.

In trust, truer...

Amen!
Amen!

You okay, Cam Deezy?

Why wouldn't I be?

Nothing I do is ever
good enough for him.

It doesn't even matter.

God already chose your path.

You're gonna go to
Atlanta and be great, Cam.

Believe that.

You don't feel like I'll
be abandoning the group?

How?

We're about to record a single

because of the song you wrote.

And I know, once
you get out there

and turn them in the spirit,

more doors will
open for all of us.

You really sure?

You're the guy who
took me to prom

because my date stood me up,
the night of, for someone else.

Yeah.

You've always been
there for others

making sure they're okay.

Yeah. I'm sure.

You're not abandoning us,

and we're not abandoning you.

Thank you.

I needed to hear that.

So, you taking Dawn
with you or what?

Keep an eye on my
girl until I get back.

You got it.

-â™ª Voice was made
-â™ª My voice was made

â™ª To worship you

-â™ª Made to worship you
-â™ª My voice

â™ª Was made to worship you

â™ª I lift my voice in worship

-â™ª You're amazing
-â™ª Amazing

â™ª Everlasting

â™ª Creator of all things

-â™ª Creator of all-
-â™ª Creator of all-

That was amazing!

I mean, I knew you were good,
but hearing you in here!

Oh! No, that's it.

That's it, I've decided, we
are recording an album, huh?

Okay Camden, you can
go and start working

on the new music
next week, all right?

And I can book studio
time right now.

What? What?

Dad, we need to talk.

What about your ministry here?

I prayed about it.

I believe that shadowing Royce

as the minister of
music of his church

will better prepare me to run
the music department here.

Oh, you prayed about it?

Well did you pray about
what you will do for money?

Royce is gonna pay me
as one of the musicians

of his church and for every
song I do on his record,

and he's gonna let
me live in his house

so I don't even have to pay
for rent or bills, or all that.

So we're supposed to go
without a minister of music.

So you can go and do what?

Make music.

This is a solid
opportunity, Dad.

This is a waste of time.

This is my shot!

I gave you a shot.

And like I expected
you blew it off,

running to go make
music with someone else

outside your family!

Dad...

I gave you all the platform

and opportunity you
needed for your music.

That's fine. Hmm.

"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" is
employed by the church.

We have an agreement.

So whatever you do, I own
you, and the church owns you!

And by the way, I'll
make sure Royce knows

where to send those
royalty checks.

There it is.

That's why the promotion.

It's always about
the money with you.

Nothing about God calling me.

Just you using me.

You have always been ungrateful.

You leave and you are done here!

I'll cut you off and you
won't have a place here

when everything falls apart,
you come runnin' back home.

Don't worry. I won't.

You just gonna leave like that?

I always knew you were gifted.

I knew from the first
time your little

three-year old fingers brushed
across your toy keyboard.

That's why I invested
in all of your lessons.

I was more than your mom,
I was your chauffeur,

cheerleader, manager, backup
singer, whatever you needed.

I never missed a recital.

I never let you quit.

I always knew you
were gonna be great.

That's why I can't let
you leave like this.

I love you, mom.

And I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

But how am I supposed to leave?

With your head up.

Hmm, with love, with support,

knowing if there's
anything you need,

anything, I'm here for you.

I love you, Cam.

Just know...

that mama?

Will always be here.

â™ª It is well with my soul

â™ª It is well, it is well

â™ª with my soul

â™ª It is well, it is well

â™ª With my soul

â™ª With my soul, it is well

â™ª It is well with my soul

Camden!

Royce is waiting on
you in the studio.

I'll take your bag.

Follow me.

No. I prefer sweet tea, please.

Well, aren't you a country boy?

You're Ivy Whitlow.

I am. And you are?

I'm sorry, I'm Camden Wilson.

Pleased to meet you.

Oh, I know who you are.

Royce talks about your
music all the time.

Can I get you a drink?

I'm good, thank you.

Hmm, handsome and chivalrous,
but I'll tell you what,

these Atlanta birds are
gonna scoop you right up.

I have a girlfriend in Dallas.

Well, she's back in Dallas.

I'll warn you now.

These Atlanta women,
they're a different breed.

So, I know you're
a super songwriter.

Do you also sing?

No. I just write the songs.

I leave all that up
to my brother, Blaine.

Okay, well, let's
see what you got.

Okay.

Hold on, hold on.

Camden Wilson.

Hey.
Welcome.

Welcome to Atlanta.

Oh, thank you.
You have a good trip?

Yeah.
Good.

Well, you told me
you had 100 songs,

so, let's get to work.

It's all your yours, let's go.

Okay.

This is the song I was
thinking about on the way here.

Um...

â™ª There's a beautiful spirit

â™ª In this place, hmm

â™ª There are wonderful
expressions on these faces â™ª

â™ª Feels like heaven

â™ª This must be like heaven

â™ª This must be like heaven â™ª

â™ª God, it feels
like heaven â™ª

â™ª Mmmmm

See why I wanted him to come?

Hmm.
Welcome to Atlanta, Camden.

What's up y'all? This is...

"SO G-I-F-T-E-D"

And you're listening to WPRS,

the only gospel
station in Houston.

â™ª I hear your prayers,
rain down on me â™ª

â™ª I bring fire, the rage in me

â™ª I bring the flame,
that sets you free â™ª

â™ª That sets you free

â™ª Are so faithful
to me, yes you are â™ª

â™ª Are so faithful
to me, yes you are â™ª

â™ª Are so faithful to
me, how much you are â™ª

These lyrics are great.

I just made this one
adjustment to the vamp.

It's right there.

â™ª And you are so
faithful to me â™ª

-â™ª And you are so faithful
-Mm-hmm.

This is pretty great.

It works.

Thank you.
Thank you.

I think you may have just
finished my new single.

I've been hearing great things

about "SO G-I-F-T-E-D"
on these gospel blogs.

Their performances
are generating

a lot of buzz for
going to worship.

Yeah. Blaine tells me they
booking all over the place.

Opening for my dad.

He's preaching everywhere.

Yeah, I've actually
been talking to your dad

trying to figure out a way
for us all to work together.

Sounds like a plan to me.

I just wanna make music.

Well, those conversations
will happen,

right, after "Born To Worship"
goes to radio next week.

I can't believe my song
is gonna be on the radio!

Between that and my
new single with Ivy,

everybody's gonna
know your name.

Have you thought
about going solo?

And leave the group?

And do what?

Be your own artist.

Or write for other
artists full time.

I haven't thought
about that at all.

Well, you should.

Ivy's been begging me to
let you write for her.

And I'm struggling finding
songs for her new album.

Maybe you should take a stab?

Are you serious?

I'm going deposit money
into your account.

It's a deposit to help
me produce Ivy's album.

I'm very serious.

â™ª Hmm

â™ª Da, da, da-a, yeah

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

I really enjoyed service
today, Dr. Whitlow.

Please, just call me Norman.

I feel like we're brothers

as much as I followed
your father's ministry.

You know, I bet
you Camden's father

really misses him leading
praise and worship?

Well, since we have him here
for a little while longer,

Camden, do you
wanna let them hear

what we have been working on?

I don't think it's ready.

What? Oh, my God.

Be confident, be sure. Come on!

Okay.

Come on.

I mean, it's just a
simple call and response,

but you know, Ivy's voice
doesn't really need much extra.

Oh, gosh.

It goes like this.

â™ª If God is in the
midst of two or three â™ª

â™ª God is in the midst
of two or three â™ª

â™ª If God is in the midst
of two or three â™ª

â™ª God is in the midst
of two or three â™ª

â™ª Chains are broken

â™ª Chains are broken

â™ª Souls redeemed

â™ª Souls redeemed â™ª

â™ª If God is in the
midst of two or three â™ª

â™ª God is in the midst
of two or three â™ª

â™ª Mmm, if God is in the
midst of two or three â™ª

-â™ª God is in
-â™ª Chains are broken

â™ª Chains are broken

â™ª Souls redeemed

â™ª Souls redeemed

â™ª If God is in the midst

-â™ª Of two or three
-â™ª Of two or three

Wow!

Camden, you should sing more.
Great.

Oh, well, Ivy wanted a duet.

I'm just laying
down scratch vocals

until we find another
artist, a real one.

Royce, now I told him

that I want him on
the actual track,

but yet, he just won't budge!

You're anointed, son.

I see why Royce
brought you here.

And I also see why they
can't get enough of you.

You also see why his
song "Born To Worship"

is number one on the
billboard gospel chart?

Hmm!
Oh, man.

What?

There you go.
Congratulations.

Wow.

Will y'all excuse me
while I make a quick call?

Sure. Right down the
hall is my office.

Second door on the right.

Thank you.

Yo?

Did you hear, bro?

Number one!

Yeah, of course I heard bro.

We've been watching
the charts every day

since the single came out.

We over here busting our butt,

while you chillin' in Atlanta.

Here you go, baby.
Thank you.

I wish! I've been
working hard too.

I just did a song
with Ivy Whitlow!

Ooh, Ivy Whitlow.

Dude she...

she fine as hell!

You hit that?

Seriously?

Out of the mouths of pastors!

Don't judge me, bro.

I'm still a man trying to
change his childish ways.

God loves me, okay?

Oh, yeah, Dad worked
it out with Royce

for us to come out there to
work on some new music with him.

Might be dropping a EP since
the single's going crazy!

Dope, right?

Yeah.

Your girl misses you, bro.

She'd love to see you.

Can't tell.

Felt like she
barely speaks to me.

Oh.

Yeah.

A'ight, bro, I gotta go.

Congrats. Love
you, miss you, man.

I love you back bro.

Why you always in my business?

I saw you checking her out.
I didn't check her out.

I was like this, like
it was, I almost fell.

I'm over you.
Like my neck

almost fell back.
Yeah.

Just checking on you.
Is everything okay?

Yeah. I just had
to call my brother.

This is huge for us.

This is a special
moment. You deserve it.

Thank you.

I know that you're used to this.

You pump out hit after hit.

Thanks to you I'll
have a new hit.

It's been a while since
I felt connected to music

the way that I did with yours.

It's also been a while since
I felt connected to a man

the way I feel with you.

Dr. Whitlow is...
He's a wonderful pastor

and a great leader, but
he just doesn't see me.

He doesn't make me feel as alive

as I do when I'm with you.

Ivy! Hey!

Your husband's down the hall.

Shh!

I can get us a room at the
Four Seasons in two minutes.

I have a girlfriend...
Who isn't here.

Ivy!

Wow. You're serious.

Okay.

Well welcome to
the Dr. Ray Show.

And today, Ivy Whitlow, finally,

I have you sitting on my set.
Yes.

I've been trying to
get you here for years.

Really, thank you.
I'm honored.

I am so honored to have you.

It's a pleasure.

Do you mind if we
just jump right in?

Go ahead, girl.

Right now there's a
very interesting dynamic

going on in gospel music.

There is. And Royce London.

Oh!
He is a powerhouse, honey.

Always has been.

Now Royce London is a
very, eccentric man of God.

Oh yeah. Well that's
one way to put it.

Yeah, I get it.

Now Ivy.
Yeah?

For years there have been
rumors floating around.

Okay.
That Mr. Royce London

has women running in
and out of the studio.

That he takes on
young female artists

for his own personal pleasure?

Now, he's my friend
and he's a great guy.

Okay?
Okay, okay, okay.

Okay.
Why don't we talk about

other producers?
Sure.

Like his latest edition?
Okay.

Mr. Camden Wilson, out of
Dallas.

Hmm.
His personal life

is very ambiguous.

He's got no real
social media presence.

True.

But he's a great songwriter
and he has a girlfriend.

Okay.
Okay?

So let's...
Well...

So you've never seen
him with a lot of women?

Well, I'm not saying that.

I'm just doing a song with him.

He has had some girls
in and out of there.

Oh!

I'll say that much.

Okay, so Ivy, come on.

You can tell me!

Have you ever seen anything
suspect going on in the studio?

Well, I don't really
know the guy like that

but I'll tell you this, all
those late night sessions?

Yeah.
With all those chicks.

Yeah.
Like come on.

I haven't heard not
one song on the radio.

Now let's just get back

on my project, okay?
Okay.

Thank you.
Well, Let's talk about

your latest single shall we?
Yes, absolutely.

I'm so glad she's here.

I can't believe this!

My girl's gonna kill me.

What did you expect?

Here, you need this.

What are you talking about?

The endless flirting.

Prioritizing her music,
giving her all your free time.

I kept it strictly professional.

Okay. But she hasn't.

Look, I'm a musician.

I have a girlfriend.

She's married.

I came for the music.

And she came for something else.

And you turned her down.

Let me guess, you didn't?

Ivy...

Ivy can be poison.

No, Ivy can be a drug,
and I was hooked.

But time has passed, we
moved on, we worked it out.

And then you show up.

Bright-eyed, sanctified,
fresh for the picking.

So I'm just supposed to
sit back and do nothing?

I'm sorry,

I'm not as comfortable with
false accusations as you are.

This is my reputation.
This is the business.

Rumors float around
about every male artist.

Some true, others
wishful thinking.

You gotta get tougher skin.

This industry says God first,
but it's business first.

And if you don't get your
business under control

it's gonna get control of you.

And how am I
supposed to do that?

You might wanna start
by taking care of home.

You see that body over there?

Hey!

Oh my...
No.

God.

Don't look at me like that.

I'm self-conscious enough.

I went shopping
with Amber earlier

and she convinced me that
this dress looks good.

It's too much?

No, no, you look nice.
It's,

Nice.
You look really nice.

Like, nice.
Ooh.

Yo, B?
What?

Thank your dad again, man.

This is like the nicest hotel
in this state here bruh.

Offerings must be
looking right on Sundays.

Bro, it's the church we
sing at that covers us.

Not us.

Either way, I'm straight.

Look, I'm just here for the
steak and the lobster stuff.

I want one of those pretty
drinks with the umbrella

and all the food up in it.

Except for strawberries.

Dawn?

You okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

I'm good.

I'm good, y'all, Stop!

What? I'm good.

I'm good.

So how long are we
supposed to act like

we didn't see Dr.
Ray's interview?

Yo, Akil, man, come on bro.

Just saying.

Oh.
Thank you, thank you.

I just don't like
them insinuating

that all church boys
do is sleep around.

That's all you do.

Hey, hey, I respect women.

That means nothing if you
don't call them the next day.

What?

I just think that she
was coming for Camden.

And Royce, I mean, he's
an OG and so anointed.

Hold up.

To be anointed and talented

are two completely
different things.

Facts.

Just because you
throw God up in there

don't make one the other.
Right.

It's what I'm talking about.
You should know.

See, God don't like that either.

But, what reason does she
have to go there with Camden?

I don't know.

But one thing we all
know, Camden's not like...

What?
Yo, what?

Nothing.

-Dawn-
-Amber, Amber, Amber,

are you okay?

Yeah. Why?

No. Your face.

You see that.
Oh my God,

you're breaking out in hives!
What!

Waitress.
Oh my God, what is...

Where there strawberries
in that drink?

Because she said
no strawberries.

No, I actually told them
to take strawberries

off of the cup.

She's allergic to the juice
in the strawberries too.

I am so, so sorry.

Come on, I got some
medicine in my room.

Do you guys want us
to come with you too?

Yeah, we can help you.
No, I'm fine.

You guys hang out.

They're still bringing dessert.

Oh, that's exactly
what I plan to do.

Find me some dessert.

You know what I'm saying
-That's my boy!

Amber, are you sure?

Meet me at the room later.

You need to unwind.

You show our girl a good time.

Easy.

See he treats you good.
Take care of her.

You take care of her.

Really?

No.

You know, we ain't paying
for none of this, right?

Look, Akil got
everything comped.

Okay.

Okay? No.

And it's not the
waitresses fault.

It absolutely was her fault.

How?
Typical.

What?

She's cute. She's pretty.

She'll always get a pass.

I mean yeah, she a'ight, but
she ain't my type!

Please, she's every
man's type, come on.

No, she's not.

Are you kidding me?

No.
I wish I looked like her.

What do you mean?

D, what are you talking about?

You're perfect just
the way you are.

I mean, who would have
known what you was hiding

under them choir robes and
little liturgical dance dresses

and all the things you...
Shut up!

Just sayin'.

I do not wear any of that.

What are you talking about?

You do be buttoned up though.

Oh my God.

Okay. I be covered up.

Oh my God. That's my point.

You don't need all that.

Maybe if Cam saw what
he was working with

y'all be running down
the aisle right now.

What reasonable man
would resist all of that?

I'm waiting till
marriage, you know that.

No, I get it. It's honorable.

I just do not know how my
brother held out this long.

What man, what reasonable
man can resist all that?

That boy's saved-saved, man.
I mean, I should be happy

that I have a man that
respects my virginity, but,

like we never even
been hot and heavy

if you know what I mean?

My brother's always been
the cautious one. Right?

It's a gift and a curse.

Yeah, but to what end?

Sometimes a woman just
wants to feel like a woman.

I mean, virgin or not.

I don't know why I'm
telling you all this?

Oh, 'cause you know you
can tell me anything.

We go back, D.

It's been rough.

I wasn't trying to put
our business out there

but we've barely talked
in the past few weeks.

I mean, he just
started blowing me up

when that blog dropped.

What am I supposed to think?

That you have a man that
loves you and you trust him?

Yeah, that makes
me feel invisible

even when he's in the room.

Is it wrong to just
wanna feel sexy?

To want somebody that wants me
and ain't afraid to show it?

I mean, damn, can I
get a little passion?

I'm sorry.

I'm rambling.

No, no, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

I get it.

You wanna feel like a woman?

You wanna man that desires you

and with my brother,
you can't tell.

What if it's true, Blaine?

No.

No!

Look.

Put this down.

Look, all right.

I don't know what
that chick's deal is.

My brother, he
doesn't sleep around.

He's waiting for you!

Why? He doesn't even want me?

Come on.

Damn, no.

Wait, wait, let me do the moves,

let me do the moves,
wait, wait, wait.

Hips, hips, uh, uh.

Okay, then you,
wait, wait, wait.

Eeh, eeh.

Okay, mm, mm.

You know I did it
good, don't judge me.

All right, at least
we're dancin' now,

at least we're movin' our feet.

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry for

talking your ear off all night.

No.

I think that drink was
a little bit stronger

than I thought.
No, come on, D,

it's nothin', I'm here.

It's what a future pastor's
supposed to do, right?

Isn't it just so hard

always trying to be so perfect?

Wait,

Dawn, yo, nobody's perfect.

We all make mistakes.

Lord knows, I have.

Sometimes, I feel like
I haven't made enough.

Well, what do you mean?

Dawn, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn.

We can't do that.

All right, all right.
No I'm sorry, I'm so stupid.

You're not stupid.
You're far from stupid.

You're so beautiful, man.

â™ª I'm tired of makin'
love, I want it rough â™ª

â™ª Ooh-Hoo, ooh-hoo, oh

â™ª Boy you better show me
somthin' new tonight â™ª

â™ª I wanna break
up and go harder â™ª

â™ª Tonight you're gonna pull
my hair, scream louder â™ª

â™ª And I don't see
nothing wrong â™ª

â™ª Sometimes bad
girls got it too â™ª

Hey girly.

You guys were hanging late, huh?

Where were you all night?

What?

What in the hell were
you thinking about?

It just happened, Dad!

Nobody's buying records

or following a pastor
with a baby mama.

Maybe we can just explain
everything to Camden.

Ma, he loves her.
He'll still marry her!

You can't be this stupid.
What?

He may never forgive her.

Or you.
Oh, stop yelling.

This was bound to happen the
way you let him run around

like God's gift to women.

Just shameful.

I just never thought that you
would have been stupid enough

to let it happen with
your brother's girlfriend!

Mom, Mom, I know. I'm sorry.

It, it just, well maybe
she could just step down

from "SO G-I-F-T-E-D"?

The group will understand!
The group?

The family legacy, that's
what's on the line.

So she has to make the
sacrifice?

Something has to be done.

What about Camden?

Oh, now you wanna
think about Camden?

You will take care of this.

Come on, Dad.

Do the right thing.

Okay, Mom.

Cam Deezy! I missed you!

What's up?

Man, I hate I haven't
been gigging with y'all.

Oh, please, man.

You're way too busy to
be giggin' with us, dog.

Well, listen, listen.

Don't even worry. All right?

You ain't even missed much.

Just, you know, crowds of
adorin' fans, five star hotels,

and you know, scrumptious
meals and all that man.

Yeah, rub it in, rub it in.

Love you man!
Oh, man!

Good to see you.
My boy!

Ow!

What's up man!
I missed you.

Missed you too, man, you
still lookin' weird as hell.

Boy, what they
feedin' you on here?

Man, here we go.

You the one who's
gainin' all this weight.

You liftin' all
them ladies, boy?

Somethin' like that.

Yeah.
What.

Hey.
What's up?

Hey, I missed you babe.

I...

You good?

Yeah, just had a
long, rough flight.

Well look, come on,

I wanna show all of y'all
this amazing studio, bro.

It's crazy.

Go get the bags.

-I have to tell you somethin'
-I gotta tell you something.

Go ahead.
Oh, I'm sorry.

No, you go first.

Okay.

Look, I know I'm
constantly talking to you

about being patient
and I want you to know

I really appreciate it.

Listen, you've been waiting for
me while I figure out a plan

and get clarity on what
God wants me to do.

And I appreciate that babe.

More than I say.

What I'm trying to say is,

-Dawn, I love you-
-Camden stop!

Look, I've had a lot
of time to think,

and you being away has
given me some clarity

on what I want and
what I deserve.

Dawn, I know what
this is about, and...

There's someone else.

Really?

It wasn't planned,
it just... happened.

Who is he?

It doesn't matter.

If this is about you
being ready for marriage...

No, I just, I want
something else...

Someone else.

And this, it's not gonna work.

Not for me. Not anymore.

I'm sorry.

I should go, I should go.

House, house, bro.

Proud of what you did, man.

It's dope, man. You did well
for yourself, partner.

What is it?

No matter what I do...

You know, I came down here
tryin' to answer the call,

set up a life, a
situation for me and Dawn.

Proved to Dad that I'm...

What are you talking about?

She broke up with me, man.

Dawn says

there's someone else.

We're done.

Did you know?

What? No, bruh!

No, man, you know, I
would have told you.

Are you okay?

Hey, what's going on over here?

Dawn broke up with Camden.

Did you know?

Man, it's a shock to
everybody, you know?

But, um...

everything happens for a reason.

Just know we love you, hear me?

Tonight was the night.

For?

Camden.

Listen, you wanna put this
on the hand of the woman

who will truly love you
for the rest of your life.

If she's not the one,
she's not the one.

This is my fault.

No, no, no.

I'm certain this has
nothing to do with you.

Sometimes people
just grow apart.

She might be doing you a favor.

Better now than you two divorce
and hate each other later.

I thought she loved me.

I know.

Hey, you'll be all right.

You deserve better, Cam.

How can you be so sure?

Because, I know you.

Yo, what are you doing?
You're making a scene!

Yeah, really Blaine, really?

What? Is your future wife
already embarrassing you?

Look, calm down.

Look, if wanna go
back to the hotel

I'll just tell them
you're not feeling well,

okay?
No!

I just want this whole
nightmare to end!

This is all your fault!

My fault?!

I made you sleep with me?

You do what the hell
you wanted to do, man.

Yeah, and you think
that marrying you

was gonna fix everything?

You can take your
ring and go to hell!

What did you just say?

You slept with Dawn?

Bro, it's not...
Camden.

It didn't mean anything.
Sorry man, it

I was, it just happened.

It just happened.

-Cam, one thing just
-Cam,

led to another.
It didn't mean anything.

It didn't mean nothin'.
Camden, look at me, I swear.

Look.
It didn't mean anything.

It didn't mean anything.

It just happened.
I swear bro.

I swear, just talk to me!

No stop! No, stop!

Camden stop!

Whoa, yo! No, no, no, no.

Get off of him!

Get off of him!

Yo, we're brothers man!

Get off me man!

We're brothers!

You go to hell!

You didn't deserve this.

I'm sorry.

Sweetheart!

What are you doing?

I can't find my
King James Version.

Oh!

You about to meet King James

if you don't come
down from there.

The doctor said no
strenuous activity.

Did you take your
heart medication?

So you just wanna go ahead
and give me a heart attack?

Did you invite Camden to
the church anniversary yet?

Not yet.

Pick up the phone
and talk to your son.

The longer you wait the
harder it's gonna be.

I've forgiven you.

He will too.

â™ª I was born to worship you

â™ª To worship you, worship
you, worship you â™ª

-â™ª Ooh
-â™ª My hands were made

â™ª To worship you

â™ª You made my
hands to worship â™ª

Hey!

Sorry. I'm late.

I don't know why they
tell you to order online.

It still takes forever
for them to make the food.

Hey, is that all you got for me?

Thanks for feeding me babe.

Now you know I'm
always gonna make sure

my man has what he needs.

Hey, did you get the
invitation from your dad

about the church's anniversary?

It looks like it's
gonna be good!

Camden!

Checking in on him
through your mom

is not the same
as talking to him.

He had a major heart
attack. You almost lost him.

Enough is enough. Call him.

For what?
So you can let all this go.

Because babe,
something's missing,

and I think once you
talk and forgive him,

you know, maybe you
guys can work it out.

Forgive him?

I'm good.

Who would have thought
after all these years

one of my dearest friends
would call me out here

to help with a studio session,

then turn into the
love of my life?

It's been four years, Cam.

And since I moved out
here to be with you,

to stand by you, yeah,
you've been good,

but you haven't really
been happy in a minute.

I am happy! Don't say that.

You make me happy.

I don't mean that kind of happy.

You're a minister of music,

a sought after gospel
songwriter and producer.

A man of God.

How can you forgive
a God you can't see

but you can't forgive your
brother that you do see?

You've been happy, but you
haven't had peace since,

Amber.
Cam.

I love you, but you're
wrong on this one.

Just like you were
wrong for not going back

when your dad had his
heart attack months ago.

I mean, Dawn says he's doing
okay, but, you need to call him

and we need to go
to this anniversary.

Everyone's gonna be there.

It'll be a good time for
all of us to make peace.

You need to make peace.

No, we're going, period.

A'ight.

Okay. Under one
condition, though.

Hmm?

You wear this engagement
ring when we get back home.

I will, but I'm
not saying anything

until you make this right.

Now tell me again, why
is it on me to fix this?

Because, you are the good son,

and forgiveness is
for you, not them.

You lucky you cute.

Dawn, Dawn I'll be home soon.

I'm out with dad.

Why would I be lying?

I'm not, you know, I'm
not doing this, but you.

Bye, bye.

Gosh!
Keep it together, son.

Dad, I'm fine.

She's the one that's tripping.

All right, that's
what I'm saying.

Keep home together.

Don't let tail out
in these streets

make you lose everything.

Dad, we got a prenup,
you know that.

I'll never lose everything, man.

What's wrong, Pops?

You okay?

I'm gonna have Dolores
help you in Houston.

What? Why?

I haven't had her
really working for me

since I got out of the hospital.

And, your mama made one
request for our anniversary.

So mama's request was
to get rid of Dolores?

Dad, how long has she known?

I don't know, son.

But Delores is not
worth me losing this.

The Wilson name, huh?

No, I just love your mama.

I've put her through enough.

Life is too short to continue
hurting the people you love.

So, I overheard Dawn and
Amber talking the other day,

and, it's looking like Camden

might be coming to the
anniversary.

That's good.

That's great news.

It's about time my
two boys come home.

I have so, so much
I wanna say to him.

Now you scaring me.

You scaring me, old man.

Anniversaries have
that effect on me.

Makes you appreciate
what you gained

and realize what you lost.

What have you lost, Pops?

Time.

What have you lost?

Camden. I miss my
brother so much, man.

Yeah, well you have
time to make it right.

A'ight, don't get all
sentimental on me.

Only thing I'm about to
really lose is some weight

if I don't get some food
in my stomach, amen?

I need to eat.

I have been craving the
smothered pork chops all week!

Man, you bad.

Hallelujah, right?

It's pouring down, huh?

It is, man, but I
wouldn't be your son

if I didn't know how
to drive in this.

Don't worry it, I got you, man.

Dr. Forrest,
dial 118, please.

Dr. Forrest, please dial 1-1-8.

Mmm.

Have they said anything else?

No.

Ma, ma!

What happened?

They were just going to dinner,
and then it was raining,

and the police don't
know what happened,

but, Blaine lost
control of the car.

My God, they're
both in surgery now,

but, I don't know
what's happening.

They won't tell me
what's happening.

Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

I'm sure they'll be fine.

Oh!

Oh!

Your son Blaine is
still in surgery.

His right leg was
severely damaged

but we're able to repair it
and we expect a full recovery.

Oh, thank you Jesus!

Oh!
Thank you.

Oh, Cam, he's still alive.

Oh, and my husband.
He's still in surgery?

How's he doing?

Mrs. Wilson,

there was a lot of
internal bleeding

and too much damage
to his heart.

I'm so sorry.

We did everything we could.

No!

â™ª Great is thy faithfulness

â™ª Mercies I see

â™ª All I ever needed

â™ª thy hand hath provided

â™ª Great is thy faithfulness

-â™ª Lord I have
-Cam, Cam, Jesus.

Cam!

I missed you so much, bro.

Sorry.

Happy to see you.

Man, I'm happy to see you.

Where am I, bro?

You're in the hospital, bro.

Hospital? Well where's Dad?

Camden, where's Dad?

Camden, where's Dad?

Camden, where's Dad?

No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

Answer me! Where's Dad?

Where's my...

Answer me, Cam.

Cam, where's Dad, man?
Don't play.

What's this?

I found it in your
father's study.

He wrote it around the
time of his heart attack.

I was gonna give it to you later

but I think you need it now.

I'll give you a minute.

Son, my dear son,

I've made a lot of
mistakes over the years but

my biggest was not making
sure you know how much I truly

loved and respected you.

Your virtue was intimidating.

I mean, what kid finds
a $50 bill in the mall

and helps the security
guard find the owner?

Decides to value his
temple and honor God

by saving himself for marriage.

And what man fights for his
dream and protects the gift

God has given him so
fearlessly, with such fervor?

Now, look at you.

Award-winning producer
and songwriter

working with gospels' best,

writing hit after hit,
topping chart after chart.

I couldn't be more proud.

I have admired you so
much over the years

you always had the
heart of young David,

of the psalmist, with the
word and then strength

of God flowing through you.

Flowing through him,

ready to slay giants
with the smallest pebble,

I just never thought I'd
turn into one of those giants

to get in your way.

I know you never
really understood me.

And there were times I think

we didn't understand each
other, and that was my fault.

I hope to talk to you again,
face to face, man to man.

But, if I don't, I
want you to know I'm...

I'm sorry for how I treated you.

I'm sorry for what
I did to our family

and I am sorry I never
took the time to tell you

how amazing you
truly are and how...

How proud I've been all these
years to be your father.

Never let anyone silence
your gift, or your voice.

You are a force
this family needs.

A force the body
of Christ needs.

Be a stronger man than me.

Be a better man than me.

Actually, you already are.

And I love you, son.

Dad.

When I gave you this ring,
I didn't know what it meant.

I was too busy
thinking about myself.

Well, that's what you do best.

No. Yeah, but...

Lord knows, I've
learned the hard way

how life grows you up.

I'm looking you in
your eyes telling you

that I'm gonna be a
good husband for you.

For so long, I couldn't
forgive myself for what we did.

And I thought that the life
I got was the life I deserve.

No, D, no, absolutely
you didn't deserve

the way I treated you.

You did not deserve that.

I'm sorry.

We can't change the past.

But maybe if we start today...

it can have a happy ending.

Baby, you're a beautiful woman,

a beautiful mama,
and a beautiful wife.

And we're a family.

I love you, Dawn.

I love you too.

If you, um,

if you knew my father,

BC Wilson,

you know that he'd be
impressed with this turnout

for a celebration of life.

My father counseled
so many of you.

Hmm. He bailed some
of y'all out of jail!

He paid mortgages.

He put groceries on
more than a few tables.

BC Wilson was a man
that believed in honor.

He was a man with a
heart for ministry

and a passion for
Jesus and his church.

You never could tell
when he was struggling

because he never wanted to
distract from the message.

I can hear him now.

"Y'all, shouldn't be
mourning like this for me,

well at least not too long."

Because he'd want us
to finish his work.

He'd hope that his
life was not in vain.

He hoped that someone
would accept Christ

as their personal savior before
they leave the sanctuary.

He didn't know he was about
to draw his last breath

when he got into the car on
the way to his favorite meal.

But he always told me and
Blaine, "Always be ready."

And that's how he
lived his life,

ready to face every challenge.

I challenge you to
be ready as well.

Be ready, be grateful,

be forgiving.

Time is too short,

and we can't let time slip away

not letting people
know that we love them,

and maybe, more importantly,

not letting people
know we forgive them.

Because how can we love a
heavenly father

who we can't see

if we can't love our
brother who we can see?

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª Love you back to life,
love you back to life â™ª

â™ª The way that you touch and the
way that you lay my body down â™ª

â™ª All the things
that you do to me â™ª

â™ª That make me wanna
scream out loud â™ª
