Who'd you bring home last year?

Sheila? What was her name?
I didn't go home last year.

What about the year before?

I'm not the first girl
you ever brought home, right?

Jackson! Oh, God!

This makes it worse.

You never told me it was like this.

It's a farm.

There's a mortgage.

It's no big deal.

Oh, my God.

Some little farmhouse you got here.

Watch your step on the ice.
Yes, dear.

Man !

Come along.
Don't be impressed.

You'll wake her up.
I'm sorry.

She's put you in the guest room.

Bummer. Where are you?

Across the hall.

Well, it's her house.
It's a Catholic thing.

Come on.

No way.
I'll sneak you back before she knows.

No way.

An angel in the kitchen
and a devil in the bedroom.

Now, that's what I like
in a man.

Oh, my God!

Oh, I am sorry.

I thought you were
in the other room.

I am in the other room.

I came in here this morning
to, uh, say hello.

Well, I guess I better hurry up
and be embarrassed.

I thought you were Jackson.

Yes, I could tell.

Please forgive me.
God, no.

Just-- I can't believe--

Well, hi. I'm Helen.

Of course you are.

And I'm Martha Baring.
Welcome to Kilronan.

Thank you. Thanks. Oh, boy.

Where is that son of mine?

I don't know,
but I'd like to find him.

Yeah, so would Il

Well, so much for first impressions.

Go ahead and enjoy his breakfast..,

and I'll look forward to seeing
a lot less of you downstairs.

Oh, my God.

We can walk a bit.

You show a lot of promise
for a city girl.

Thank you.
You're a terrific liar.

Well.

Mom, the place looks great.

Only because it's covered with snow.
It's been hard this fall.

But I don't want to talk
about anything depressing.

Let's talk about our week.
I made some plans.

I hope you don't mind.
We're not staying the week.

We can't.
Of course you can.

No, we have to leave
right after Christmas. I'm sorry.

But, darling--
We have to leave on Wednesday.

If you have to go,
you have to go.

I Just thought maybe--
Well, never mind.

I Just-- Look at the time.

We have to get back for church.

Go on. Go after her.

She misses me.

Go.

I think I made a better impression
with my clothes off.

You look great.

You look beautiful.

Sure.

I love this house, Jackson.

There's something about it.

I suppose.
Maybe it's you.

How me?

I don't know.

You, where you come from,
who you are.

The architecture of a life.

Pretentious?
Just a little.

What?

Now?

Well, look at you.

You're putting me to shame.

Do you think this is too much
for church? I checked with Jackson--

No, not at all.

I envy your confidence.

Are you sure?
Actually, I did bring another one.

No. I just worry you'll get cold
in that freezing old church.

Here.

It's broken.
It's Just-- It's an old catch.

I'll have it fixed.

Who are these people?
Are they your parents?

Yes.

Where are they this Christmas?

They died a long time ago.

I am sorry. I didn't know.

Okay, you can stop talking
about me.

Let's go.

Go ahead. Please go on.

I love the scarf.

And the angel said to her,
"Hail, blessed one.

The Lord is with thee.

And you will conceive
and bear a Son.

And the Lord God will give Him
the throne of His father David...

and He shall reign
in the house forever.

And of His kingdom
there shall be no end."

Amen.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas to youl
You're looking well.

Hello, Father.
Ah, the prodigal returns.

Welcome back, Jackson.
Thank you.

Baring and Son
finally back in business.

You've made your mother
a very happy woman.

Nonsense, Madge. I've been happy
since the day he was born.

Mom, does everyone think
I'm moving in?

Or is Madge
Just your trial balloon?

With the fliers I sent out
and the ad in the paper--

I didn't tell her that,
but I guess my hopes were showing.

I know you want me to work the place,
but my work's in New York.

You never speak about that Job
as if you loved it.

Helen's in New York.

That's mighty inconsiderate of you,
young lady.

Steal away my baby boy.

Now, why can't you
just be sensible?

Leave your life, your work
and your friends...

and move in here
with a controlling old woman?

Learn how to bake bread
and shovel horse shit.

You're not that old.

I'm sorry, sweetheart.

Let's not let Madge
spoil our Christmas.

Good night.

Oh, Martha.

Hello!

I'm sorry to disturb you there.

I think I'm lost.
I'm looking for Kilronan.

Go back that way.
Follow the tar road.

Second left.

Second left, okay.
Thank you.

You can tell Mrs. Baring
I'll bring the birds by later on.

Merry Christmas.

Hi, baby.
Where've you been?

Please. I got so lost.
I'll tell you about it later.

You cleaned up?

I'm shocked.
No.

Must've been my mother.
Old habits die hard.

She does all this with no help?

The help never staysl
She doesn't give them anything to do.

By the way, I caved in. We're staying
for the New Year's Eve party.

Ten, nine, eight...

seven, six, five, four...

three, two, one.

Happy New Year!

Still love me?

I'll love you, dear.

I'll love you
till China and Africa meet.

And the river
jumps over the mountain.

And the salmon
sing in the streets.

There he was.
He was standing right beside her.

Did you have a good time?
It was a great party.

I'd say it was a triumph.

Short-lived maybe, but--

Never mind.

Here's to you, my darlings.

Good night.

Happy New Year.

Oh, my God.

You do make a better impression
with your clothes off.

All ready?

I think so.

Well--

Oh, I almost forgot.

I had it fixed.
Oh, my God.

You shouldn't have.

It's perfect.

Well.

Just look at us.
I've gone and set you off.

I'm sorry. I'm just...

not so good with good-byes.

Well, you go on.
Just go on.

Bye, Mom.

Bye, baby.

Now, you take care out there.

The last flight.

I know, I know.
I haven't fixed it yet, but I will.

You are so punished.

No sex.
Not again.

Oh, well.
Be it ever so humble.

Home, sweet home.

So how was the vacation?

His mom was great.
He was a little bit weird.

Please. They're always
different around their mothers.

Excuse me. The way I see it,
it's all about the breasts.

Within one mile of us right now...

100 men are talking to their shrinks
about their mothers...

and thousands of women
are talking to their shrinks...

about their mothers-in-law,
which is responsible...

for half the divorces.

Like mine. You think I'm Joking,
but just wait, you'll see.

Now, wait. You marry the guy.
The mother is his problem.

I've heard that one before.

We've projected to complete that phase
within 16 months.

This new triple-E glass
is non-reflective...

which will make
the neighbors happy, minimal zing...

the wrong kind of visual impact...

and optimalizing--
if that's a word--

energy conservation
for both heating...

and cooling.

They, uh, 60-percent glass--

You're home early.
Are you okay?

I don't know.

What do you mean?

I'm pregnant.

Now, this is where you're supposed
to go, "Are you sure?"

It seems that
my diaphragm is broken.

Marry me.

I think I lost my Job today too.
I barfed on Gavin.

You said there was no other reason
to get married...

unless you were pregnant.

You're pregnant.

It's settled.

I love you.

Marry me.

Is that a yes?

Kilronan.
Are you sifting down?

Wait. Don't tell her I'm pregnant.

What is it? Tell mel
Helen and I are getting married.

She's pregnant, isn't she?

How'd you guess?

Mothers know these things.

Where is she?
is she there?

Hi, Martha.

Congratulations

Isn't this the best news ever!

A baby.

And a wedding too, I suppose.

When will it be?

We better hurry, hadn't we?

We could have if here at Kilronan.
What do you think?

We were thinking something more
like City Hall, something like that.

We were?

May the Lord bless these rings
and those who wear them...

as a sign
of your fidelity and love.

What God hath Joined together
let no man put asunder.

By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

You look lovely, Helen.

Good luck, Helen.

Hi there.
You look great.

Hi. Congratulations.

Thanks.

How're you holding up?

I'm dying.
You're a beautiful bride.

Who's that?
Oh, I don't know.

What?
She got him back.

Who?
Your new mother-in-law.

You never showed for our lunch.

We were supposed to have lunch?

Whenever you could visit me
at the home for the near-dead.

But your new mother-in-law said
you had bigger fish to fry.

Alice Baring.
I'm Jackson's grandmother.

Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. Hello.

She never told me
we were supposed to have lunch.

She wouldn't, would she?

That's why you have to be
so careful of Martha.

I'm used to her folderol.

That's why I invited myself.

I'm the only one left
on his father's side.

Let's see the handcuff.

Looks familiar.

It belonged to Jackson's mother.
It's a family heirloom.

I know. I gave it to her.

That was before I knew her better.
When are you due?

How did you know that?

Well, you can't be stupid
and breed horses.

Takes a lot of know-how
and control.

One man to help the stallion,
one to help the mare...

one to hold the tail...

and one to finesse the situation.

Now, Martha, she can manage
all that by herself.

Alice! What a surprise!
I Just didn't think you could make it.

Yes. Wasn't it lucky?

Two weeks of chasing every catering
truck in the county, and I hit pay dirt.

Why don't you come with me.

Darling, they want a picture
of the happy couple.

Take your damn hands off me.
Oh, Alice.

Goddamn it, Jackson.

God.

One word,
and I'll slice you wide open.

You got that, my pretty lady?

God. Please don't hurt me.

My very pretty lady.

Please.

I'm pregnant.

I know where you live.

Don't you forget that.

That was a very close call.

That's pretty smart,
telling him you were pregnant.

Most men run when they hear that.

It's a bad joke.
I'm sorry.

Look, you take care
and get some rest, okay?

Good night.

I can't get his voice
out of my head.

Oh, my God. I can't go.
Look.

And I changed the locks.

Are you okay?

You sure?

You're going to be all right.

Surprise!

Oh, my God.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

How did you get in here?
I didn't mean to frighten you.

How did you get in here?
The super let me in.

Hello, darling.

Good to see you.
Oh, my heart!

You sure you're all right, darling?
Yes?

He took my locket.

With the picture of your parents?

Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

Mom?

The land alone
is worth more than this.

Jackson, it's a developer.

You know, golf course
and houses.

They're going to have to tear out
all the barns, the paddocks...

turn the pastures into fairways.

Kilronan Country Club and Estates.

Can you imagine?

Two years ago, we were offered
more than three times this much.

Two years ago,
it was a going concern.

The oldest horse farm
in the county.

Where are you going to go?

Well...

I don't know.

I've never been anywhere else.

Look.

I can't run that place
all by myself anymore.

And if you can't help...

then you've got to let me sell it.

I'm going to get the coffee.

If she really wants to sell it,
why does she need your permission?

Because it's mine...

all of it.

It was left to me, not to Martha.

Honey?
Yeah?

How long would it take
to fix up Kilronan?

I don't know.

The stables need renovating,
the stock's down to nothing.

Could make a good run in a year.
Make it attractive to a buyer?

I could run
some projections for it.

Why don't we do it?

Okay, I will.

First thing tomorrow morning.

No, I mean--

I mean, why don't we do it,
the whole thing?

What do you mean?

Honey, I think that this could be
a great opportunity.

You could do the horses.
I could do the house.

Talking a lot of money.

Two mortgages.
But we could take out a loan.

With you down there, they'd fall
all over themselves, giving you money.

What do you think?

I don't know.

I just don't know.

You never know. Maybe we'd fall
in love with the place and want to stay.

What about my mom?

What about your mom?
I like her.

What about the baby?

Oh, my God.

What was I thinking?

Deprive my child
of the wholesome environment...

and family values
of a New York City childhood.

The dirt, the noise.
Who could want more?

Let's talk.

I need to tell you something.

You know my father died.

What you don't know
is that it was my fault.

When he fell?

But honey,
you were seven years old.

I was hiding under the stairs.

My parents were arguing.

They were fighting about this woman
my father was seeing-- Robin Hayes.

He was leaving us to be with her.

So Mom stormed out the back...

and I thought my father was going
after her, so I charged in there...

Like I was going to save her.

I went straight into him.

He stumbled back
and lost his balance.

The doors were open
to the basement stairs.

He went down.

I started screaming for my mom.

It seemed like forever
before she heard me.

She'd been pulling boards off this shed
to make room for my kittens.

She came in,
and she had this look on her face.

She was still holding
this nail puller in one hand...

and this tool basket in the other.

She dropped them,
and they made this loud sound.

And then she hugged me tight.

And she told you
that it was just an accident.

She did.

Oh, baby.

You know,
I hated him for the affair...

the way he hurt her.

But I still--

Love him.

You've been living
with all these ghosts for so long.

You should go home.

We should.

Face all those ghosts.
Live in the home that you loved.

With your mother and me.

And our daughter.

And our daughter?

Is there something
you're not telling me?

I guess my hopes are showing.
Runs in the family.

Congratulations, Mr. Baring.

Thank you very much.
Now you've done it.

Congratulations.

She's beautiful.

Dear God, thank You
for bringing my family home at last.

What happened to you?

Don't ask.

Here.

Oh, God.

Honey, how do you really think
Helen is doing?

What do you mean?

I don't know.
She just seems so delicate and fragile.

I worry about her.
Why?

Every woman is different, but--

Hell, I don't know
how to say this.

But, you know, sometimes
during a pregnancy--

Turn around.

Oh, God.

I'll just say it.
Sometimes during a pregnancy...

making love can be uncomfortable...

physically, emotionally too.

Did she say something to you?

I just think maybe, you know...

you could keep your distance a little,
you know?

You mind your own business.

Where are you?

Oh, my God!

Are you all right?

I brought you some tea.

It's herbal. Lemon verbena.

Very relaxing.

It's almost like a drug.
I'm surprised it's legal.

Here.
Thank you.

You're welcome.
You gave us quite a scare.

Oh, my God.
There were so many of them.

It's the poison.
They go up into the rafters to die.

It's makes them bleed to death.
It's painless, but--

Does leave a lot of bodies around.

God.
Well, it's over now.

You just relax.

I feel so strange.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

Oh, Helen, it's all right.

I know exactly how you feel.

Your muscles ache...

and your skin is so sensitive.

And your mind--

It Just goes haywire, doesn't it?

Yeah.

You are a lovely, lovely young woman.

You just remember that.

No matter what...

Jackson may say or do.

You know, men can act strange
during a pregnancy.

Sexually, I mean.

My husband was devoted to me.

But while I was carrying Jackson--

I think we'll be fine.

I just think we need
some time to ourselves.

Of course.

And you will see Dr. Hill tomorrow.

Oh, Martha, please.
You know I don't want an amnio.

Jackson was not my first pregnancy.

You had a miscarriage?
No.

We discovered some abnormalities.

It was the right thing to do.

But she would've been...

Just about your age now.

But I had to terminate
that pregnancy.

What abnormalities?

Well, never mind.
You Just go see Dr. Hill.

It's important.

Good night, darling.

Would you send Jackson up, please?

How is she?
She's fine.

She Just needs a little time alone.

What's going on with her?

Oh, honey.

You just have to be patient.

Come on.

I'm going to buy you a drink.

It seems like your husband is the only
one getting any sleep here tonight.

I tried to wake him,
but he's out cold.

Farm work will do that.

It's more than that.

Oh, honey.

Now, you two aren't having
any problems, are you?

I don't know.

He's been different
since we've been down here.

I don't think
he's ever gotten over his father.

He's not the only one.

But then, Jackson and I have
always had each other to lean on...

thank God.

I don't have to tell you
what it's like...

to lose someone you love.

Well, I was very young...

but I know.

Here's to accidents.

Fuck them.

Amen.

Turn this way.
Right here, folks.

Turn this way.
Right here, folks.

Thank you.

Good luck.
He'll bring over 500,000 in stud fees.

Are you kidding?

Breeding is everything, my dear.

Speaking of which,
Martha says you've been weak.

How are you doing?
Martha said what?

None of us want you
to lose that baby.

There's old Alice.
I didn't think she got out much.

Darling, come Join us.
I don't want you to feel left out.

Alice is here.

Really? I don't see anyone.

I'm going to go say hello.
I forbid it.

Excuse me?

It's just, she's a crazy old woman.

I don't think she deserves
your attention, that's all.

I don't think I've been forbidden
to do anything since I was five.

What happened? Are you all right?
Yes.

You gave me such a scare.

Why did you yell?

I have to have you
leave this area.

God!
Ma, what the hell happened?

She walked right in front
of the horse.

You all right?
I'm fine.

Oh, my God. I can't look.

Is it near the baby?
No. It's at the other end.

Now that I have your attention,
there's one thing I want to mention.

What's this I hear about you
wanting to have the baby at home?

What? I never said that.

It's a romantic idea,
but too much can go wrong.

Besides, I can't have you young mothers
cutting into my income...

now can l, huh?

Dr. Hill, who told you
that I want to have the baby at home?

Of course it was her.
This is so invasive.

Let me ask you,
is this my baby or is it hers?

She's lived here all her life.
She knows him socially.

She knows him.

Fine. But why is she telling him
things I didn't say?

She's just trying to be helpful.

Don't humor me, please.
Give her a break.

It's for your own good.

Isn't it?

Yes. It's for my own good.

She's right, and I'm always wrong.

Thank you.

What took you so long?

Go on. Spit it out.

You didn't come here
for the food.

Can I ask you a question?
Please do.

At the wedding, you told me
I had to be careful of Martha.

What did you mean by that?

You mustn't pay attention
to anything comes out of my mouth.

I'm incompetent.
Didn't she say that?

And incontinent.

Sort of unreliable at both ends.

Here, girls!

I feed them the whole pharmacy.

Heartburn, ulcers...

blood pressure.

They're immune to everything now.

The oldest living Confederates
in America.

There you are, girls.

Here's the thing.

I don't have anybody here
to talk to.

I'm kind of busy right now,
but I can fit you in.

Come. Let's sit over there.

All right.

Ever since we moved back here...

Jackson is becoming more and more--
I don't know-- distant.

Distant from you,
closer to her?

I think that--

You think you're losing him to Martha.
That's what you think. You'd be right.

Why don't you say
what you mean, damn it?

Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

She was a stable girl.

She was?
Shoveling horse shit.

Not that I hold that
against her, no.

I admire her ambition.

She got herself pregnant.

She got herself a husband and son...

and a fine family name.

And now she's breeding herself
a grandson, isn't she?

She never loved my son Jack.

All she ever wanted
was that baby.

After she had it,
she put my son out to pasture.

and she took Jackson...

and poisoned his mind
against his father...

and me.

She'll do the same to you.

I think she already has.

She made a beautiful widow,
Martha did.

So much more attractive
than a divorced womanl

Was Jack going to leave Martha?

Nobody leaves Martha.

Believe me when I tell you that.

You bring Jackson to visit me...

and I'll tell him the truth
about his father.

I'm his bloodl..

and I love him.

You tell him that.

Hello, Dr. Hill.
This is Jackson Baring.

I know this may sound strange,
but have you seen Helen?

Where have you been?
We've been so worried.

Am I not allowed
to leave the property?

She just appeared.

Of course.

It's Just that I wish you'd tell us
you were going somewhere...

so we'd know where you are.

Good night.

Good night, dear.

She's your grandmother.
She wants to see you.

Come with me.

Just go to sleep.

We'll talk about it
in the morning.

Mrs. Baring,
we haven't seen you for a while.

Alice will be pleased.

Where is she?

She's still having a steam treatment.
You know Alice. Always the last one.

Go on in.

What a surprise.

Why don't you go to my room?
I'll be right with you.

Who pays your bills here?

Why, you do,
with the money Jack left you.

Is it cheap here?

I don't know.

Cheap is something
you'd know more about than I would.

Is it cheap here?

I suppose not.

Well, you suppose right.

And what is the only thing
I have ever asked of you in return?

What is it?

That you stay away from my family.

That's all you have to do.

Now, is that so much
for a mother to ask?

What did you tell her?

What dirty little lies
did you tell her?

Answer me.

I have.
You Just can't see my finger.

Isn't time a terrible thing?

Tick, tock, tick, tock.

And look what happensl

Are you going to behave?

There's something
I've wanted to tell you...

ever since the first day
you came here.

You always smell of horse shit.

Damn you!

Now, you stay away from my boy.

You understand?

Well, I'll take that as a yes.

Good-bye.

Sister, she wants a little more time.
She says it helps her Joints.

She's incorrigible.
I'll give her five more minutes.

Make it ten.

Come on.

We can't go on like this.

Like what?

I don't what has been going on
between you and me and your mother.

I'm trying to be respectful of that,
but it's been very difficult. And you--

I Just--

I love you.

I really love you, and we need
to be supportive of each other.

I understand
that she's your mother...

but soon I'm going to be a mother...

and I need you.

I'm not sure I understand.

Even at this fee,
with a modest number of bookings...

we should get a cash flow increase
sooner than we expected.

You mean we're ready to sell?

Mom, look.

Helen's not happy here.

I want to take her
back to New York.

I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.

I love her.
She's my wife.

I want her to be happy.

Things have been tense
between Helen and me.

But I want you to know
that it's been all my fault.

It's hard for two women
to share the same household.

I can see that my ways bother her...

and I'm truly sorry about that.

But one thing I do know:

What we both want
is that horse to win this weekend.

Helen and I will be packing,
and everything will be ready...

for my grandson.

Grandson, huh?

Listen, darling.

Your first responsibility
is to her.

She's a wonderful girl,
and I love her.

What?

Are you surprised your old mother
can be a human being?

Well, yeah.

But the truth?
I'm sorry to leave.

Don't be.

That wife of yours needs to go...

where she belongs.

Dr. Hill.

Franklin.

You know, I was just
thinking about you.

Were you?
Yes, I was.

That's nice.
I know this is not by the books...

but could I talk to you
for a minute about Helen?

What's the matter with her?

This girl is so filled with anxieties,
I don't know what to do.

It probably has something to do with...

all those books on pregnancy
she's reading.

That'll do it.
She has got it in her mind...

that first babies are always late,
and I don't know what to tell her.

If she's a week or two late,
it's no problem.

Tell her we can induce
right here.

Oxytocin brings on contractions
within 24 hours.

That's the same thing we use for horses.
Is that possible?

Yes, it is.
Exactly the same.

Tell her whatever it is,
we got the cure.

It's not like when you and I
had our babies.

Can you believe
I'm going to be a grandmother?

No, I can't.

Tell me, is it a boy
or is it a girl?

You're going to get me
into trouble.

I Just want to know what color
for my layette.

You know I hate yellow.

What color do you like?

Well...

blue was lucky for me
25 years ago.

Why don't you play your hunch then?

Bye.

Come on, boy.

Come on.
Come on, big boy. Get in there.

Don't worry about me.
I'll just be here packin'.

Sure you want me to go?

Yes, I want you to go,
and I want you to win...

and I want you to get your ass back here
as fast as you can.

It's more than three hours away,
and you want to get there before dinner.

Come on, you lovebirds.
He's already in the van.

Bye, baby.

Good luck, okay?

Now you take care, both of you.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

Won't be long before this place
is everything it ever was.

Kilronan rises again.

Kind of a shame, isn't it?
What is?

That we won't be here to see it.

And the same hey to you, darlin'.

You're lookin' even lovelier.

I brought you something.

Kind of a head start
on baby pictures.

Oh, my!
This'll be a big hit around here.

These nuns love a fetus.

I came to say good-bye.

"Hello" and "Good-bye"?

We're goin' back to New York.

Good for you.

You're well rid of that woman.

Why Jackson ever came back here,
I can't fathom.

That was my idea.

I Just-- I thought he had to come back
and face all the ghosts.

He still blames himself
for his father's death.

No. He shouldn't.

His daddy fell on a farm tool that was
lyin' at the foot of the stairs...

one of those things they use
to pull nails out of boards.

He landed on it just wrong...

and it crushed his sternum.

It was in all the newspapers.
Doctors commentin' right and left.

A bizarre happenin'.

Jackson must accept that.

You better be careful
on your way out the door.

When Jack told her he was leavin',
she turned demonic.

I can see that.
She strikes me as the jealous type.

Now, what possible reason could
she ever have to be Jealous of Jack?

Well, didn't he ever tell you
about Robin Hayes?

Jack and Robin?

Walk me.
These old farts shock easily.

What?

I was Just remembering
when I had Jackson.

Oh, I thought that pain
was just gonna rip me in half.

How stupid I am.

Oh, honey, l--

Here.

Let me get you some dessert.

No, thank you.
I'm really tired.

I'm gonna go upstairs.
But I made it specially for you.

Come on. It's strawberries,
your very favorite. Go on. Take it.

Indulge yourself.

Go on.

Take it.

You deserve it.

I think I'll just take it
up to bed.

Yes.

Go on.

That baby needs
all the rest he can get.

Or she.

Good night.

Sweet dreams.

Tender around that joint.

We'll see how it does.
All right.

My God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

I detest my sins
because I dread the pains of hell..l

but most of all
because they offend Thee, my God...

who sent me a daughter-in-law
from the land of the Moabites.

"And whither thou goest,
I will go," she said.

"And your people
shall be my people."

And she went down to the threshing floor
and did exactly...

as her mother-in-law instructed.

And she conceived a sonl

And God said,
"He will be born and renew your life...

for he is born
of your daughter-in-lawl..

and is better
than seven sons."

You understand, don't you?
This is all for him

And the baby...

the precious baby who has no one
to protect him from her.

Hey. You kicking' me again?

Is that nice?
He is weak, my son.

I am his strength.

You hungry?

And God said, "Let the woman
of emptiness become full.

And you...

who are most worthy...

shall take the child
to your bosom..l

and become ifs mother.

And the women neighbors...

will give him a name...

saying, 'A son is born to you--

To you."'

I firmly resolve,
with the help of Thy grace...

to confess my sins,
do penance and amend my life.

Amen.

You bad girl, you.
You found me out, didn't you?

I saw a light.

Well, there's Just
no stopping you, is there?

What is all of this?
What are you doing?

It was my surprise for you, honey.

Oh, well.

Surprise?

I wanted to set it all up like this
for you to see...

and then I was gonna ship it all
up to you in New York.

But I Just thought...

the presentation
would be so vivid.

I'm sorry.
It's all right, honey.

Really, it's all right.

Why, look,
we can still show it to Jackson.

Won't that be fun?

Yes.

Are you all right?

I'm Just tired.

Well, come on. Let me take you
back up to the house to bed.

What are you doing,
walking around with no shoes on?

Wait.

What is it?
ls it the baby?

Could I have some water?
We're almost to the house. Come on.

No. I need some water.

All right.
I'll be right back.

Howdy.

What can I do you for today,
my pretty lady?

Pretty lady.

I know where you live.

Oh, my God.

Just tryin' to be friendly, darlin'.

Goddamn !

What on earth are you doing?

Do you think you are some alley cat
dropping your litter by the roadside?

Oh, the pain is terrible, isn't it?

Darling, I can feel it myself.
I can feel what you're feeling.

My God, help me!

Oh, I wish I could.

Believe me, I wish
I could give you something, but...

I can't.

You just have to go through it...

and feel it deeply.

And then you will never...

ever forget
what your child means to you.

I'm begging you.

Well--

This is a big one, isn't it?

I put a couple C notes on him myself.
Good.

I sent a buyer to Kilronan
the other day, and Martha told him...

you guys had changed your minds.

She did?

Now breathe. It's almost over.

Breathe, darling.

It's okay. You're all right.

Breathe, Helen !

Hello?

Mother?
I was hopin' it was youl

Well, of course
everything's all right. Yes.

Good. Can I talk to her?

She's here. Talk to her in a minute.
How's she doing?

So how did the morning workout go?

Great. He's running the best he's been.
We're ready.

Did you draw your post position?
Yes.

Mom, look, the race is beginning.
Can I please talk to Helen?

Oh, no-- I'm losing you.
I'm so sorry, honey.

I can't hear you anymore.
Can you hear me?

Let me go.

Shit.

You're doin' good. Come on, honey.
Push a little bit harder.

Push.

I am pushing, you bitch! God!

They are at the posfl
Flag is up.

One last time.
Now push down !

Push, Helen!

Come on. You can do it.
Give it to me.

Come on. Push.

Yes. I can see it.
Come on. Push.

Oh, my God!

Yes, I can see it coming! Push!

Across the wire!

Yes! You got him!

Push! Don't you quit now.

Oh, my God!

It's a beautiful little boy.

He looks just like Jackson.
Sweet, sweet boy.

What a beautiful boy.
Give him to me.

Mama's gonna get you
all cleaned up. Good.

No! Give me my baby!

I'll love you, dear.

I'll love you till China...

and Africa meet..,

till the river
Jumps over the mountain...

and the salmon
sing in the street.

You are losing so much blood.

Look at the mess you've made
of my linens.

I really wanted us to be
a family together. Really, I did.

But I don't know
if that's possible anymore, do you?

Oh, it's a pity.

But you were so weak
during your pregnancy.

Everybody knew that.

And you would insist...

on havin' that baby
right here at home.

But I did my best. You know I did.

Of course, you won't remember it
that way, will you?

You'll tell them all sorts of things
about me, make up stories.

You know, it's very dangerous
to take more than Just a drop of thisl

I want you to know that Jackson and I
will raise the baby the way it deserves.

I'm home!

You'd have been proud.

Mom?

I'll be right there.

I've been callin' and callin'.

It's a boy.
You see? I knew.

He came so fast, like a freight train,
I had no time to call anybody.

But your wife, she was so brave
and so strong.

She needs to sleep now.

You have no idea
what she's been through today.

Don't you want
to hold your son?

Is she okay?

Helen's doing just great.

Come with me.
I need your help.

We've got to give
this boy his first bath.

She's fine.

She Just needs to sleep.

Hey, Mom.

Oh, honey, you can't get
a good night's sleep in this chair.

You go on off to bed. I'll keep watchl
Thanks, Mom.

Not a chance. I want to be here
when she wakes up.

I wouldn't miss it for the world, no
matter how many kinks I get in my neck.

Your wife and your baby
are gonna need you at full strength.

You got a tough
few months ahead of you.

Thanks for seeing her through this.
Well, to bed now, young fella.

March. I won't take "no"
for an answer.

Shut up, Mom.
Quit while you're ahead.

Good night.

Hi, Mommy.

You wanna meet
your little baby boy?

This is your mommy.

How you feelin'?
Okay.

Where's Martha?

I think she's asleep.

She says
you really went through it.

Thank God she was here.

Yeah.

Honey, will you
do me a favor?

Ask her to make us
a little bit of breakfast.

You hungry? That's good.

If you need anything,
I'll be downstairs.

Well...

there you are, Daddy.

Good morning.

Hey. Mornin'.
You been outside?

Yeah. I was lookin'
for somethin' in the barn.

You really ought to be in bed, young
lady, after what you've been through.

I feel wonderful.
I really do.

Ah, God,
I slept so deeply.

It's like I was drugged
or something...

Iike 20 years passed,
and I Just don't remember a thing.

Oh, it has.
We just forgot to tell you.

Oh, great.

What's in the bag?
Just this thing I found in the barn.

Those eggs smell good.

What?
"What" yourself?

What's the mystery?
Oh, humor me, huh?

This is such a happy day.
I don't want to bring everybody down.

Come on, baby.
Don't keep us all in suspense.

What's in the bag?

It's one of those things
that killed Jackson's daddy.

I've never seen one before.

What are you talkin' about?

I realized this morning,
now that Jackson has a son of his own...

he's gotta let go of all those
old ghosts so he can be free.

And I Just got obsessed with finding
one of these things and burying it...

so deep in the ground that it can't
ever harm anyone in our family again.

I know that sounds hormonal, but--

There's no thing that killed my father.
He fell down the stairs.

Oh, but it wasn't the fall
that killed him.

Your mama went downstairs after
you called her, just like you said...

and she found that he had fallen
on this thing in this freak way.

It was even in the newspapers.

He fell on somethin'
at the bottom of the stairs?

Oh, honey, I think Helen is right.

This is not the day
we should talk about this.

Yes, he fell. He fell on this.

It's probably not the same one.
There must be lots of these around here.

What are you doing?

Whatever do you mean?
That's how Jack died.

He fell with tragic, almost
inconceivable precision...

on this thing
that crushed his sternum...

just as surely as if someone
had smashed it into his body.

You were tearin' boards
off that shed.

How could you remember that?

You were seven years old.
You were scared to death.

What I remember is that you were
holding that thing when you hugged me.

When you dropped it,
it made this loud clanging sound.

Like this?

Why are you doing this?

Trying to tear my family apart
just because you lost your own parents.

She wasn't--
She's not foolin' anybody...

with that wide-eyed, innocent--

Do you know
what she's implying?

Even if I did have
one of those things in my hands...

that doesn't mean there wasn't another
at the bottom of the stairs.

You remember that day.

You remember the fall.

That fall could've killed
anybody who--

Why, no one's implying
that you killed Jack. My God!

Lots of wives have affairs
and don't kill their husbands...

because he finds out
and is gonna leave her.

My father was
having the affair.

Oh, no. You got that backwards.
Robin Hayes was a horse wrangler.

Martha was having
an affair with him.

Alice told you that,
didn't she?

That's Just the kind of twisted lie
Alice would invent...

and your wife would try to perpetuate
to turn you against me.

Don't you see what she's doing?
412-263-1841.

I just talked to Robin Hayes.
He's expecting the call.

Would you like to speak to him
for old time's sake?

Robin Hayes died last year
of a heart attack.

There's one you didn't cause.

You Just couldn't bear
to let a happy family be, could you?

We were so close to being happy.

Here's how close we were.

Your mother tried to kill me
last night.

That's a lie.
Nobody leaves Martha.

Don't you see? Your father was leaving.
That's why she killed him.

And what's worse, she made you,
her own child, think that he did it...

so that she could bind you to her
for the rest of your life!

I want you to throw this lying bitch
out of my house!

There's only room
for one of those.

You'll never prove anything.
She doesn't have to.

Oh, but Jackson, you can't--
Shut up!

Everything about you is a lie.

This place and everything in it
will be sold.

You will never see me
or any member of my family again.

But I did it all for you.

You are not my mother.

You did this.

You tricked him! You trapped him!
You got yourself pregnant!

I know what you're after.

You want my farm, my land...

my boy!

You want to take everything I have
and leave me with nothing!

Don't you see what she's doing?

She wants to be me.

So long, Martha.

Grandma.
