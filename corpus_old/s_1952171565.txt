Get out of the way!

Wow, that had to hurt.

Well, robbery wasn't a motive.

His eyes took the 
brunt of the punishment.

If he can't see, he can't fight back.

But he may have tried.

Tony Sciarra,

from Philladelphia.

So much for brotherly love.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS:  2004/04/01

Our victim Tony just  
checked into the hotel.

Hadn't even unpacked.

He made enemies fast.

Yeah, the old man at the casino who  
he knocked down said the same thing.

He was howling ass

Why?

Blood drops are medium to large.

Low velocity of spatter, no castoff.

May be he wasn't  
beaten with a weapon.

Hand to hand?

I know this guy is  
yoked, he's what?

6'2, 6'3?

Size doesn't matter  
when you're outnumbered.

Damn!

There's our vic, leaving the floor.

And the cameras, no eyes  
on the corridors or the rest rooms.

Yeah, well, we know where he went, 
just show us where he came from.

That's good. 
Start it from right there.

Did you see that?

Yeah, the little guy on  
the right just sneaked him.

You gotta be kiddin me,  
he just did it again.

Two for two.

That guy has got stones  
going after a mark as big as Tony.

He knows he has backup.

Is the third time a charm?

Yes, it is.

Busted.

Accusations from Tony.

He's gettin hot!

Some kind of denial  
from the little guy.

Tony got worked,  
he wanted his money back.

We're gonna need a still  
of the little guy's face if you could.

You got it.

Fractures to the zygomatic,  
ethmoid, and nasal bones.

Also, the mandible and the maxilla.

How many teeth did  
you find at the scene?

Two.

He's missing six.

I found one in the back of his mouth, 
probably swallowed the other three.

I'll check his stomach.

Blood evidence at the scene,

suggested his attackers  
did not use a weapon

Contusions are non-descript,  
no foreign tool marks,

Bare knuckles?

That's what I'm thinking.

Multiple blows to the head produced angular  
acceleration and deceleration to the brain.

Twisting to the brain 
causes the bridging veins to rip

from their the axons within the  
white matter of the brain begin to snap.

Officially COD is diffuse axonal injury,

unofficially,

so much brutal  
beating I've ever seen.

Neck bruises were  
made by a left hand?

What about these bruises?

There's no defensive wounds  
on the hands or forearm,

so I'm guessing  
he was restrained.

Bruises could be  
somebody's knees on his chest.

So a hand on his throat,  
knees on his chest,

his head was butted  
up against a wall,

and all the blows  
were directed at his face

Doesn't leave much room for  
any other attackers to get their legs in.

May be there were  
no other attackers.

One guy did all this?

So you're sure this  
was the man you saw?

Yes, I was in the bathroom.

I waited for him to leave,

Then I called security. 
Do you see this man now?

All you have to do is nod.

Thanks.

ID's off! We're looking 
for a blue shirt and jeans.

He could have ditched the 
clothes so let's be smart about this.

Las Vegas Police!

Put your hands behind 
your head and stand up.

Come on!

You're not much of 
a talker, are you Walter?

I tell ya,

you must be a pretty 
tough guy to take on Tony.

The guy's big as that, he's huge.

That's his name you know, 
Tony Sciarra from Philladelphia.

Did you know Tony?

How come you left his wallet, 
and $500 of chips in his pocket, huh?

Cuz, that makes me think 
this was about something else.

Did he wrong you in some way?


May be it was just,

a lovers quarrel.

I'm not soft.

Yeah, it's ok. This is Vegas.

But that's not what 
we saw on the video.

You're at the Craps table,

you swiped his chips,

and then you whispered 
sweet nothings in his ear.

What did you say?

Give me a reason.

Tthat a confession? / No,

it's what I said.

That stare doesn't work on me.

Better save it, 'cause 
they're gonna love you in prison.

You can't fight.

Mr. Darian, may I see your fingers?

Why?

Well, because you may have 
evidence underneath the fingernails,

and I would like to collect it.

Mr. Darian, do you have a fever?

I'll kill you.

Get him down.
Get him down.

You might wanna 
double check that.

I did.

It's not as bad as it looks.

Never looks good when 
a suspect dies in custody.

What are you saying, Rory?

You'd rather be one of us?
No, that's not what I am saying.

If I was here I would have been 
in there with you, you know that.

It's just that we're gonna come 
out looking like the bad guy again.

You Okay?

I'm fine.

Nasty, kind of looks like a hickey.

You wanna tell me 
who got this party started?

I scraped his nails.

That's it? 
What was his liver temp?

101.5 
He's been dead an hour.

That means that his 
body temperature was 103.

I felt his skin Catherine. 
It felt like it was on fire.

How did Walter Darian 
even drive this thing?

Where there's a will, there's a way.

PD found it in the Orpheus parking lot.

Blue shirt and jeans, right on top.

He didn't even try to hide them.

Positive for blood. 
I'll get it to Greg.

So this scumbag, Walter Darian,

he beats a guy to death, goes out 
to his car, changes his clothes.

goes back into the Casino, 
washes his hands, and just ..

gets something to eat?

Just another day.

Yahtzee.

Must be a few thousand 
dollars worth of chips here.

So, he drifts, but doesn't cash in?

May be it wasn't about the money.

I got gloves, a T-shirt and 
a jacket all with the tags still on'em.

May be he just likes to steal things.

Road side diner, Libby.

Sara.

What does that look like to you?

Burn holes.

The guy takes on 
five cops in their house.

Makes you wonder what he 
might have done to the waitress.

Didn't get enough of this guy 
in the interrogation room?

I have a question.

Yes?

Cause of death?
Well, it wasn't the nice stick action

Cardiac arrhythmia.

His heart rate increased 
til he went into Tachycardia.

Started throwing PVCs then V-fib.

Prior conditions? / Nothing I could find
The guy had a big heart, 550 grams,

but otherwise healthy.

This guy was pumped 
up before the fight,

white knuckles veins popping.

Well, he could've been 
on something. Tox is pending.

But there were no observable
effects of long term drug abuse.

No atrophies, 
cirrhosis, tissue necrosis.

I checked all the hot spots.

He had a temperature 
of 103 when he died.

Any pathology to explain that?

The organs showed 
no sign of infection or disease.

So there was nothing 
wrong with this guy.

Well, I'll send a tissue 
sample to histology but

98.6 is just an average
Some people run hot.

See, during questioning your 
brother became a little unruly, and

so for their own safety, the officers 
had no choice but to use force,

at which point...
No, I've heard enough.

Ms. Darian, it's very important 
that you understand the situation here.

I do.

Walter was killed in police custody.

Let me introduce 
Gil Grissom from the crime lab.

This is Beth Darian. / Hello.

I was in the room with your brother.

Is that how he touched you life?

The autopsy concluded 
that your brother's death,

was not the result of 
the officer's use of force.

I don't care how he died.

I'm just relieved that it's over.

Walter hurt a lot of people.

If you had something 
he wanted, he just took it,

and if you got in his way...

I always kept my distance.

Ms. Darian, your brother's 
body temperature was ...

Hot to the touch?

He was always that 
way ever since we were kids.

I'll have somebody from the department 
contact you, all right, Ms. Darian?

I always knew that Walter 
would end up in Jail or dead.

I'm sorry.

Griss, what are 
we hoping to find here?

Walter Darian lived here.
He owned the place.

Greg ran the DNA, blood on 
Walter's clothes is a match to Tony.

The hair in Tony's hand is a match 
to Walter's, the case is closed, isn't it?

That case is closed.

You can't prosecute a dead man.

The evil man dew lives after them, 
but good is often turned with their bones.

Sheakespeare?

Julius Caesar.

This guy never 
threw anything away.

You think he had 
a major case of OCD?

Well,

if Walter viewed his 
world as a threatening place,

according to the shrinks, 
the hording of useless objects

may have made him
feel safe and secure.

Yeah, well, in the real 
world Walters is the threat.

Guess he didn't like what he saw.

Hey, Grissom,

this doesn't look like a Patio.

Libby, Libby.

Oh, yeah, dish girl.

Did she have a last name?
Sure she does, but I don't know it.

When was the last time 
you saw her? / 8 years ago.

The kid had no chops,

Burned herself real good.

That was her first and last day.

We need an ID. Is there any chance 
you still have a W2 lying around,

or a copy of a driver's license.

Girl wasn't here long enough to refill 
a coffee pot, let alone sign anything.

I don't know where she came from, 
don't know where she went.

What about this guy,

did you ever see him with Libby?

Uh, I'm gettin nothing. 
Sorry, orders up!

What thing makes this sound?

Well,

I guess there was 
no more room at the inn.

It's a wedding band.

You think this is the waitress 
Nick and Sara are looking for?

Well, there's no clothing left, 
the wedding band can be either or,

There's nothing gender-specific yet.

Next to no tissue.

No hairs at all.

If you get the bones, 
what do you think, Grissom?

Been down here at least three years?

It's probably more that three years.

You're kidding me, right?

Well, the rule of thumb is if the skull 
smells bad it's usually under three years.

This one smells like dirt.

There's something 
under the pelvic bone.

Possible murder weapon.

Do you think we could 
still get any DNA off of it?

Any blood's been exposed to the elements
longer than the inside of these bones.

There's a little skin, clothing, 
and tissue to protect it, huh?

Doesn't fit. Walter was a fighter.
He used his fists not knives, you know.

Well, we haven't known him that long.

Forheads upright, smoothe,

mandible's small, 
lower face narrow.

Female trace.
Yeah, pelvis confirms it.

It's wide for the birth canal.

No, pits in the pubic bone. 
She never gave birth.

What about her race?

Zygomatic bones retreat, slant back,

nasal opening is long and narrow.

Caucasian.

Around 5'4.

I estimated her height 
from the length of the femur.

How old are we talking?

Well, third molars haven't erupted.

No wisdom teeth.

So that would put her
in her late teens, early twenties.

Yeah, it's a safe estimate.

Cause of death?

Strangulation. 
Fracture to the hyoid bone.

What about these right here?

Fractures to the zygomatic 
bone and maxilla, also to the left ulna,

but no tool marks 
on any of the bones.

So may be, she was punched 
in the face and tried to shield herself?

Yeah, Walter Darian strangled
a female caucasian 5 foot 4,

around twenty years old.
Yeah, but is it our missing waitress?

Well, I did dental charts, X-rays. 
David's off and running with them now.

I also excised a portion of the femur,

scraped a tissue sample from 
inside the pelvis and yanked a molar.

If there's any usable 
DNA left that's where it'll be.

How did you know there was 
another body at that motel?

I didn't.

Tox and histology results 
came back on Walter Darian,

negative across the board. 
No drugs, no diseases.

I don't get it.

The guys 38 years old, 
and this was his first arrest.

And you're wondering 
what he'd been doing all his life.

Willows.

Why don't you hold 
that thought until later?

Sorry.

A new friend.

Congratulations.

Got time for something a little weird?

I recovered DNA from 
your Jane Doe skeleton,

clean samples from 
the molar and femur.

But no hits in CODIS.

So Jane Doe was never 
reported missing. /Apparently not.

I also pulled DNA from the pelvic sample.

A mixture, foreign DNA from a male.

Walter Darian.

No, that's where it gets weird.

The foreign DNA was 
homozygous at all thirteen low signs.

One peak per marker.

Shared allels, so it was 
either a father or a son.

According to the autopsy
she never gave birth.

So it was her father.
Ok, so how did it get there?

The tissue was from inside the pelvis,

so even if Daddy's blood or
semen got on her clothes or skin,

it never would have survived
being in the ground all that time.

So there has to be 
additional biological source,

cuz there was no 
one else in that grave.

That's all I got.

No name, no tissue, no hair.

I like a challenge.

Pull the standard tissue thickness 
scale for female american. caucazoolids(?)

Use the normal figures.

Apply the mid line measurements.

Good, now the bilateral.

That's the blue print.

Ok, you can take this.

Long skull,

prominent nose and chin.

May be Nordic descent.

That means light complexion, hair,

and ...

blue green eyes.

Warrick.

These've gotta be maternity clothes.

And baby makes three.

Her name's not Libby.

Dental records confirmed 
our Jane Doe was Marissa Cleary.

Which leaves our missing 
waitress Libby still unaccounted for.

Foreign DNA in her 
pelvis wasn't from her father,

it was from her son.

There was no evidence 
of a fetus or a baby in that grave.

She never gave birth.

Not through her birth canal.

There's other ways to deliver a baby.

Oh, that might explain 
the hunting knife we found.

Umbilical cord contains fetal DNA.

Walter Darian never 
threw anything out.

So where did the baby go?

8 years. I never 
thought she was dead.

I've always wondered where she was, 
or what she was doing with her life,

or what my kid was like.

Mr. Cleary, we haven't found 
any evidence to suggest that your son...

Our son?

Well, Was it a boy?

Yes. / Well, can I see him?

Is he dead, too?

We don't know.

Marissa and I had only been 
seeing each other for a few monthes.

Everything was great.

And then she got pregnant 
so we got married.

All of a sudden 
she hates me, I hate her.

All we did was fight.

She calls me one night at work.

You don't  want me in 
your life, fine, I'm gone.

Good, that's the best 
news I heard all year.

That was last time we spoke.

And you never reported her missing?

I didn't think she was.

She was 19, 
barely out of high school.

Last thing you needed was a family.

She was in her 9th month 
when she split.

I thought she'd cool off in a couple 
of days come back and we would ...

work things out.

But then I got this.

You're not who I thought you were.

You don't want me.

You don't want this baby.

We don't want you.

Marissa.

Alright, you see the long 
legs she gives to her M?

And how it stands alone?

Alright, now check out
the Dear John letter.

This is not Marissa's signature,
just a quick and dirty forgery.

My money's on Walter.

No, can't tell you anything 
without an exempler.

Yeah, well, Warrick's 
going through his stuff now.

From what I hear this 
is gonna take a while.

So what about this text?

Uh, not typed, printed.

Uh, off an ink jet, and so far all of Walter's 
acculmulated printers are dot matrix.

No match.

Warrick found a baseball cap in 
Walter's motel yielded a blond hair.

DNA was still good which means 
the hair is no more than a few years old.

It was Marissa's son's.

So he'd be 8 now 
assuming he is still alive.

Hey, guys. I've been working 
on that John Doe envelope,

the post mark was Henderson.

The Bates motel is in Sloan,

why would Walter go that 
far out of his way to mail a letter.

He wouldn't.

Well, I moved to Henderson 
to get away from Walter.

I stayed out of his life,
hoping he'd stay out of mine.

Didn't matter that I was his sister. 
He treated me like he did everybody else.

Do you recognize this woman?

No. Who's she?

Her name is Marissa Cleary.

We believe she was a guest 
in your brother's motel 8 years ago.

He killed her, didn't he?

We think so.

I wonder what she did to set him off.
I don't know.

Sure it wasn't much.

You don't want me,

fine, I'm gone. / Good.

It's the best news I've heard all year.

Shut up, shut up.

He could always find an 
excuse for anything that he did.

Are we keeping you 
from something? / No.

It makes me really 
uncomfortable talking about Walter.

Did Walter give you those burns?

No, that was ...

an accident on that job 
many, many years ago.

When you used 
to be a waitress, Libby?

Nobody's called me that in years.

How did you know? / We found your 
old waitress uniform in Walter's car.

I had the job for one day.

I was a lousy waitress,
why would he keep that?

Hi, mom. / Hey, baby.

Why don't you take your 
stuff, put it in your room.

I'll make you a snack.

How old is that little guy?
He's gonna be nine next month.

Open up.

You're not his mother.

I'm the only mother he's ever known.

I raised him, I had to.

Middle of the night, your brother 
shows up and he hands you a baby,

You don't ask any questions 
you don't report it.

Walter said that the 
mother was a runaway.

And that she didn't want the baby.

I took him in.

I love him.

How did Martin get the 
scar on his forehead?

I don't know.

Or you didn't want to know.

Marissa Cleary didn't sign that note.

And we don't think 
Walter wrote it, either.

I'm not like Walter.

When I opened the suitcase 
and I saw the photograph.

I didn't want the father to suffer.

The suit case was in Walter's closet.

I took it back.

I didn't want it around me.
I knew that he would never notice.

Giving me Martin ...

was the only good 
thing Walter ever did.

I don't know why he did it.

But it wasn't out of the 
goodness of his heart.
