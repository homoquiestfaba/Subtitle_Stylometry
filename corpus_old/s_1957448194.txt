â™ª

Hey! You're doing great!

Thank you.

Isn't this beautiful?

Yep.

Did you know that putting up
Christmas decorations early

creates a neurological shift
in your brain

that actually produces
happiness?

I did not know that.

It's true.
Can't you feel it?

I can't feel anything,
I'm frozen.

Fine, Scrooge.
I'll admire them later.

But it is cold.

It's not that cold.

Merry Christmas!

Thank you very much.
Merry Christmas.

Now, I do feel like Scrooge.

Well, do you want to go over
there and give Santa a dollar?

Fine.

Merry Christmas.
Oh. Thank you very much.

Ok, that felt good.

Oh, didn't it just a little bit?

â™ª

Ho, ho, ho!

Yo!

You still working?

Yeah.

Hey, that's a twist.

Do you think the Santa's
too warm and fuzzy?

Never.

That's why the client
requested you.

You are the king of
the fuzzy people.

The client requested me?

Well, not really, but you're
doing a great job.

Come on, I need food.

Woah, hey!

What was that?

I'm trying to distract Claude.

He's obsessing over
his masterpiece.

Looks great.

Save it to your phone.

I managed to get on the guest
list of the Lloyd Industry's

company Christmas
party tonight.

Can we go?

Absolutely.

I'm gonna need your help to snag
some face time with Leona Lloyd.

Get her to let us pitch one
of her accounts.

Leona Lloyd?

Global leader in
"prestige beauty."

That's a switch
from sports and fitness.

Well, we need to diversify,

especially after having lost
that hoverboard account.

That was only because everyone
kept crashing into things.

Yep, that did happen, yes.


Come on.

Hi.

Beatrice Carmichael.

Ok.

And Haley.

Oh, of course, enjoy.

Oh, fabulous.

Best office party
at Winterstone.

Should we grab a snack
at the bar?

<i>Dorris: Haley!</i>

You know what? I'm gonna go
check out my cocoa cart,

but I will see you
in a little bit.

Ok.

Oh, Haley, thank goodness.

The machine was working
but something happened.

And now people
are lining up

and we're almost out
of peppermint sticks.

Oh, Dorris you are doing
a great job.

Hooray!

We got it.

Why don't I take over
from here

and you'll get some
more supplies?

Oh, you're a doll.

Ok, we got this.
Don't you worry.

Hi.

Gentlemen, here we are.
Blue Skies Advertising Agency.

Blue Skies, Blue Skies...

Oh, there I am.
Donald.

Yep, indeed.
Plus one.

That's me.

It's actually a plus two,

we've had to bring along Claude
here at the last minute.

And we couldn't leave him
in the car,

it's snowing outside.

Ok, go on in.

Thank you.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

â™ª

All right, lads.

The mission is find Leona.

Let's spread out.

What does she look like?
I'm new here.

Google her.

â™ª

Ok.

Ah. That's great.

I believe there's a power plug
by the cocoa cart.

Oh, thank you.

Right this way.

Thank you.

Would you like a hot cocoa?

What?

Would you like a hot cocoa, sir?

Sorry, my phone died
and this nice lady...

Do you happen to know
where I could find a charger?

Uh, right there.

Wonderful, ok.

Sure you don't want a hot cocoa
while you wait?

That would be lovely.

[machine whirs]

â™ª Do do do do do do,
do do do do do... â™ª

Impressive.

Did you have to go to elf
training camp to learn that?

Of course.

And the last...
duh duh duh duh dun.

And then there's just the final,
there we go.

Wow.

Cheers.

Mm.

That's brilliant.

Thank you.

You know, I haven't seen you
around before.

Oh, I work at Blue Skies
Advertising.

Ah, so you're an ad man.

Well, production artist.

I'm Claude.

Haley.

Expecting a call?

Actually I'm looking for someone

but I have no idea what
she looks like.

Oh, so it's a blind
office party date?

Oh, no, no.
It's not a date.

I'm not here on a date or seeing
anyone in particular

at the moment, which means
I'm totally single.

Just way more information
than you just asked.

How 'bout you?

Same status.

So not dating anyone
in particular.

No. Not at the moment.

[notification alert]

Ah, back to life.

Well, Haley.

Claude.

Thanks for the sugar shock.

Anytime.

I'll see you around.


Yeah.

<i>[jazzy Christmas music]
â™ª</i>

â™ª

Well, enjoy.

Ben?

Ben!

Hey.

Beatrice.

What a pleasure to see you.

Yes, I could tell by
your hasty retreat.

What brings you into town?

I live here now.

You're living here?
Since when?

Almost a year ago.

I got a job as an account exec
at Blue Skies Ad agency.

Been here a whole year,
that's interesting.

Well, I kind of thought
we might have

bumped into each
other before now,

but apparently we don't hang out
at the same places, so.

Why would we?

We were never
into the same things.

TouchÃ©.

Are you working with Lloyds?

Hopefully soon.

You?

I'm just here for the free food.

Well, it was bizarre
running into you.

Take care, B.

You too.

Hey, give me a hot chocolate.

Ok, coming right up.

Do you have any Baileys?

Oh, I don't, sorry.

I found the swirl sticks.

Oh, perfect.

I am on my last one.

Here.

Is this going to be
some big production?

'Cause I really don't have
that kind of time.

Almost done.

Nope, I hate peppermint.

Oh, ok, got it.

No peppermint and the Baileys
is over at the bar.

[deep sigh]

Thank you!

You sure you're good?

Oh, absolutely.

You go and enjoy the party.

Maybe you'll find that nice
young man with the phone?

â™ª


â™ª

Any luck?

No.

Don, bogie, 12:00.

Oh, the tree is just...

All right, here we go.
You ready?

Yeah.

Ms. Lloyd.
Yes?

Wonderful party.
Thank you.

Do we know each other?

Don, Blue Skies?

It doesn't sound familiar.

We're a boutique agency.
Very exclusive.

Offering personalized high-level
marketing strategies.

Well, it was lovely to meet you.

And I'm Ben, Don's
account executive.

And Claude is our brilliant
production artist.

We're currently heading up an
innovative Christmas campaign

for a new
sporting magnate.

Which is?

Shine-ball.

It's a basketball that glows
in the dark.


Is it a national campaign?

It's local, but plans
of expanding soon.

Claude, will you show Ms. Lloyd
the layout?

Yes. Of course.

I didn't see anything.

Ah, sorry, I'm having problems
with my phone.

Sorry.
It's all right.

We would love an opportunity
to give you a proper pitch.

We're seeing presentations
on a new fragrance

for the Beguiled
Beauty campaign.

But we always go with an
established marketing team

on that one, so it might
not be worth your time.

Or you could let us dazzle you
with a fresh new perspective?

You're an ambitious bunch.
I like that.

Why don't you give
my assistant a call,

see if she can squeeze
you in.

That would be fantastic.

We won't disappoint.

Walter.
Leona.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Have you had a chance
to meet Niles?

I don't believe I have.

It's a pleasure.

Niles is our rising star.

Of course, the big guns
from Elite Marketing are here.

There's always going
to be competition, boys.

Let's head out.


Mayday, mayday.
There's Beatrice.

Act natural.
Keep walking.

What are you talking-

One sec, one sec.

What's he doing?

Does he not understand
what a distress signal is?

What a great night.
I know.

Hi.
Hi.

Hello.

Um, so they gave
the elves a break?

They did.

Um, I was just on my way out

and I realized that
the chances are slim

that our paths
will cross again,

but if you were to give me
your number,

they would increase
considerably.

I would love that.

Great, well, I have to write
it down.

My phone died again.

Of course.

There you go.

Well, Haley Logan,
I will be calling you.

Ok.

He's cute.
Yes, he is.

What was that?

I think I just met the love
of my life.


He is a production artist
at Blue Skies.

Blue Skies? So he
works with Ben.

Not the Ben you dated
in London?

Is he in Winterstone now?
Yes. Regrettably.

I just ran into him.

I knew you're secretly sorry
that you broke up with him.

Haley! Can you come here.

See you in a second.

And this is my daughter, Haley.

Of course, we met earlier
over a cup of cocoa.

It was delicious,
by the way.

No need for the Baileys.

Happy to help.

So, I didn't realize you were
Leona's daughter.

Really?

I was just talking to your
mother about our concept

for her new fragrance line.

I'd love to show it to you,
maybe...

â™ª

â™ª

<i>â™ª...when you get me
for Christmas â™ª</i>

â™ª

[door bells chime]

Delivery for my
amazing volunteers!

Get it while it's hot.

Oh, hot coffee.
All right.

Hey!
Hi.

What are you doing here?

My closet was exploding,
so time to let go.

Here, I'll take it.

Thank you so much
for your donation.

That is so thoughtful.
Of course.

Oh, who brought donuts?
Moi.

You are a horrible influence,
you do know that, don't you?

Those are for the volunteers.

Sorry, too late.

[phone ringing]

Good morning,
this is Haley.

Oh, hi, it's uh, it's Claude.

<i>We met at the, the Lloyd's
Christmas party.</i>

Hi, Claude.

The guy from the party!
Go away! Go away!

Uh, I see you got
your phone working.

Uh, yep, yep.
Fully charged.

[chuckles nervously]

So what are you doing on this
beautiful winter's morning?

<i>Uh working.</i>

But I was wondering if you would
like to maybe later this...

Evening?

You mean tonight?

Is that too soon?

No, no, no, that's-
tonight's great.

We could go to the tree-lighting
ceremony?

I'd love that.

Do you want to meet me
at my work?

It's the Hope Chest
in Old Town.

Yeah, yeah, sure.
Um, is around 7:00 all right?

Yeah.

Yeah, see you then.

So, it was him?

Yes.

And?

We're going on a date.


Oh, sorry.

Little sticky.


Boys! Big news!

We're on the books this Friday
for a meeting with Leona Lloyd!

You're kidding me,
that's amazing!

Yes!

You guys rocked!

Well, you're obviously talking
about me

because this guy is seriously
technically challenged.

I'm buying you a turbo
phone charger for Christmas.

Well, actually, that sounds
pretty nice.


So, dinner's on you then?

Well, as always.

<i>Claude: Can't. I've got a date.</i>

All right, knuckles, knuckles.

A date!
We've done it boys.

Well done boys!

Yes! Come on.

Claude's got a date!

â™ª

Hey!
Hey.

I'm glad you called.
Me too.

Shall we?
Yes.


That's true.

Do you like fish and chips?
I love them.

Uh...

[phone ringing]

Oh.

Do you want to take that,
I'll just order for us.

Yeah, sure. I will go
find us a seat.

Ok.

Hi, Mom.

Haley, I wanted to see
where you were

with the reminder invite.

I was hoping to get the final
this morning.

Oh, um, I emailed it to you.

Karen, can you find me
Haley's email,

about the Christmas gala?

Let me check.

Um, did you need
to approve it?

If you're happy with it,
go ahead and send it out.

Ok. All right.

Love you. Bye.

It's snowing!

Pure magic.

Send it to me.

Done.
Here, I'll help you.

Thank you.

Oh, oops.

Lost your bench.

That's all right,
I know a better one.

Come on. It's in the park.

Great.

Ooh!

This was a great idea.

Yeah, I come here a lot
to clear my head.

Find inspiration.
Yeah, it's so magical.

Finished?
Yes, that was yummy.

So, tell me about
the Hope Chest?

Ah. I was volunteering
at the Food Bank

and there was a lot of families
in need of help,

so I reached out
to the community

about this idea for a charity
thrift shop

and it sort of snowballed into
the Hope Chest organization.

So you started
the whole thing?

With a ton of support

and all the proceeds go
to underserved families.

Doesn't even feel like work.

Which just makes me
so happy.

That's amazing.

How did you end up moonlighting
at the Lloyd's Christmas party?

Um, I was just helping out
a friend.

You know, we should get going.

The tree lighting ceremony's
about to start.

Oh, yes. Let's not miss it.

Ok.
Come on.

[squeals excitedly]

[bells tolling]

Crowd: Five, four, three,
two, one.

[crowd cheering]

â™ª Oh, Christmas tree,
oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Thy leaves are
so unchanging â™ª

â™ª Not only green, when
summer's here â™ª

â™ª But also when it's cold
and drear â™ª

â™ª Oh Christmas tree,
oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Thy leaves
are so unchanging â™ª


[crowd applauds]

<i>â™ª Joy to the World...</i>

Christmas is finally here.

My favorite time of year.

Ok, I have a Christmas quiz
for you.

A quiz?
Yes.

Ok.

But, it can reveal secrets
to your personality,

so choose your
answers carefully.

Uh-oh. Ok.

Are you ready?
Hit me.

Favorite Christmas tree type?

Spruce, white pine,
Douglas fir, Noble...

Noble.

Good choice. Good choice.


That's an impressive tree list.

Thank you. I'm not done yet.


Shape? Full, tapered,
large, small?

Um, I have no preference.
I love them all.

But I do have a soft spot

for the Charlie Brown
Christmas tree.

Well, that's just adorable.

Ok, decorations.

Minimalist, ostentatious,
retro, traditional, hipster?

You know what, I'm going
to have to go with nostalgic.

Mm. Interesting, interesting.

All right.
Mm-hm.

I think I've got you.

Ok.

You love all trees, that
means you have a big heart.

Noble fir, you are
kind and honest.

Nostalgic decorations,
you treasure memories.

And the Charlie Brown tree,

you always see the best
in people.

What do you think?

That is a very generous analogy.

I have a sneaking suspicion
it's all true.

Thanks.
Um, next question.

How do you feel
about karaoke?

Oh, love it. But I can't
sing though.

Me neither.
Let's go Saturday.

Great.

Oh.
Oh, wait.

Yeah wait.

I told Ben I'd hang out
with him.

I made plans with B.

Do you think they're
over each other?

I don't think so.
Should we invite them?

Definitely.


â™ª

â™ª<i> Whoa, yeah</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª We've hung the ornaments
with care â™ª</i>

Aha, there she is.

Don't even need to ask how
your date went.

He's pretty great.

I don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

Claude is, he's just
so different.

But...

But?

I kind of let him believe
I'm a normal person.

You are a normal person.

No, I mean, he doesn't know
that I'm a Lloyd.

Oh.

And I don't want him to know,
at least not yet.

Why not?

Because it always
changes things

and I'm sick of guys
doing flip-flops

the minute they find out
who my mom is.

For instance, there was
this ad exec named Niles

at the Christmas party
who was being flat out rude

but the minute he found out
who I was

he was instantly gripped
with fascination.

Gripped. Sounds painful.

Stop it.

Sorry.

But it really doesn't seem like
Claude is one of those guys.

Do you really
believe he'd care?

No. And that's the point.
I really like him.

And now I have a chance to see
how he really feels about me

without anything else clouding
his judgement.


And I will tell him when
the time is right.

Promise?
I promise.

And he works at Blue Skies,

so you can't say anything
to Ben for now.

I'm not speaking with Ben.
Why would you think that?

You were talking to him
at the party.

That was by accident.

I was blindsided
by his cute new hair.

Right, ok. You've obviously
moved on

and I'm sure he has too.

Have you heard
that Ben's moved on?

Is he seeing someone?
Not that I'm aware of.

Right, 'cause I'm definitely
over him.

Ok, so you don't want to go
to Christmas karaoke with us?

Which "us"?
Claude and Ben.

Maybe. Fine.

â™ª

After you, good sir.

Hey!

I'll have a pumpkin spice
latte, please.

What do you want, Claude?

Hey, Mr. Happy. Do you
want anything?

Yeah, I'm sorry, I'll have
a Cinnamon roll, please.

Sure.
Thank you.

Thanks.

What?

I'm getting an awfully
jolly vibe off you today.

Well, 'tis the season.

Aha? Or is it Haley?

Yes.


Yeah, do you know that feeling
when you meet someone

and there's this
instant synergy.

It's like... You finish
each other's thoughts

and you've only just met.

Never had that feeling.

Don't want anyone in my head,
thank you.

Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

Oh, believe me, I do.
You mean Beatrice?

Yes.

<i>Barista: There you go.</i>

So she's got in
your head then?

Well, I just saw her
at the party,

so that was annoying
because she looked beautiful.

Mm-hm.

She thinks she's so clever.

Well, she is clever, which is
why she drives me so crazy.

Well, I'll be sure not
to mention anything

when your name
comes up tomorrow.

What's happening tomorrow?

Oh, karaoke.
Wait. I'm the king of karaoke.

Really?

What, you weren't going
to invite me?

Would you want to come?
Yes, thank you.

What is it, normal karaoke
or Christmas karaoke or...

It's Christmas, yeah.

Christmas.

â™ª<i> Good old Saint Nick,</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> up on the rooftop,
reindeer pause</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> Out jumps good old
Santa Claus</i> â™ª

Hey!

Hey.

How did it go with Ben?
Mission accomplished.

B's in too, so,
double date it is.

Excellent. Excellent.
Who's on your Christmas list?

Um, my mom and
my little brother.

My dad's gift's already done.

Oh, what'd you get him?

This awesome brisket
and meat trimmer.

What?

Yeah, he's gonna love it.

He's Keswick's barbecue
super hero.

Keswick? Is that
where you're from?

Yeah, actually I usually go home
for the holidays

but my company's got
a big pitch meeting

so I'm staying in town
this year.

Oh, who's it for?
Uh, Lloyd Industries.

Oh.

Wow, that sounds like
it's a big opportunity.

Yeah, it is.

Blue Skies has had a bit of
a rough go of things lately

and its future affects us all,

so I want to be there
for my boss.

He took a chance on me.
Hm?

Mm. That's lovely.
It's beautiful.

What about you?

Are you spending Christmas
with your family?

Just me and my mom.

My parents divorced
when I was young

and my dad wasn't really
in the picture,

so she's basically raised me
on her own.

Right. So, uh, you grew up
in the states?

Yeah, Chicago.

Ah. That explains
the American accent.

Yes. But my mother is
from Winterstone.

When I was 12, my
grandfather passed away

and he left her his house and
it was in such horrible shape

and we didn't have
the money to fix it up

but it was all that was left
of my mom's family.

My mom wanted
to keep it

so we moved back here

and she's worked really hard to
provide a life for us.

Nice!


Thanks.

What happened
to the house?

Oh. She whipped
that thing into shape.

I mean, when my mom puts
her mind to something,

she gets it done.

Right.

I would love to meet
her sometime.

Sure.

I'll take that.

Are these too loud
for your brother?

Oh, nothing's too much for him.
It's done.


Thank you very much.
Thank you.

So, what do you want
for Christmas?

Only Santa knows.

Well, should we ask him,
he's right over...

No. We should not.

[door bells chimes]

Hey. You're ready
for karaoke?

Tell the truth.

This outfit, I was going
for cushy cazh.

But I look like a potato.

No. You look... Um...
This is a disaster.

I know it's not a date,
but...

Look, you couldn't look bad
if you possibly tried

but if you're not feeling this,
this is easily fixed.

How?
I own a store.

And you have my pants.

And I have a cute sweater
to go with it.

Ok, tell me what you think.

Unconstructed blazer,
cool, contemporary,

or is that trying too hard?

Maybe the sweater?
Spontaneous, fun.

I thought you didn't care
about Beatrice.

I don't.

What are you wearing?

This. Can't improve
on perfection.

I'm going to go
with the sweater.

Hides more of my body flaws.

So you're excited for
the double date, then?

No, it is absolutely
not a date.

We are going solely to crush
Christmas karaoke.

With Haley.
And Beatrice.

â™ª

â™ª

What time is it?

Two minutes since
the last time you asked.

So rude of them
to make us wait.

We're early.
Would you just relax?

I should sit on your side
with you.

Just sit. Sit down.

There they are.

Hey.
Hi.

Hey.
Hey.

Take your coats?
Thank you.

Good to see you.

What are you doing?

I just thought, you know, guys
on one side, girls on the other.

Just... just...

Take that as well.
Thank you so much.

That's for you.

Oh, ok.

You look beautiful.
Thank you.

So, that was random.

Bumping into you both at
the Lloyd's Christmas party.

Yep. Wildly random.

So, who do you know over
at Lloyd's?

I was just tagging along
with Haley to the party.

Yeah, um, and I just know uh,
hey, are you guys hungry?

Starving.

<i>Server: What can I get you?</i>

Uh, burgers?

Server: Yeah.

Four burgers.

May I please have a salad
instead of fries?

<i>Server: Absolutely.</i>

Since when do
you eat salad?

I've made peace
with field greens.

I like salad now.

Ok, well you're not having
half my fries.

I don't want your fries.

You don't have to starve
yourself. You look great.

Think so?
Yes.

Thanks.

An extra order of fries,
please.

<i>Server: Of course.</i>

[cheering and applause]

Well, guys, do you suppose
that's our cue?

Should we go next?

A little bit intimidated.

No, come on.
Come on!

There's strength in numbers.
Let's karaoke.

â™ª

â™ª Dashing through
the snow, â™ª

â™ª in a one-horse
open sleigh, â™ª

â™ª O'er the fields we go,

â™ª laughing all the way.

â™ª Ha, ha, ha.

â™ª Ho, ho, ho,

â™ª who wouldn't go?

â™ª Ho, ho, ho,

â™ª who wouldn't go.

â™ª Up on the house top,
click, click, click. â™ª

â™ª Down through the chimney
with good Saint Nick. â™ª

â™ª It came upon
a midnight clear, â™ª

â™ª that glorious song of old.

â™ª From angels bending
near the earth, â™ª

â™ª to touch their harps
of gold. â™ª

â™ª Peace on the earth,
good will to men, â™ª

â™ª from heaven's
all-gracious king. â™ª

â™ª The world in solemn
stillness lay, â™ª

â™ª to hear the angels sing.

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Jingle bells, jingle bells,

â™ª jingle all the way!

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride

â™ª in a one-horse
open sleigh, â™ª

â™ª hey!

â™ª Jingle bells,
jingle bells, â™ª

â™ª jingle all the way!

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride

â™ª in a one-horse
open sleigh, â™ª

â™ª hey!

<i>- After you?
Thank you.</i>

So, I learned something about
you tonight.

What?

You've been holding out
on me.

What do you mean?
You have a great voice.

I really don't.

Everyone else is
freaky fabulous.

Oh, we did all right.
Yeah, we did.

Come on, let's cut through
the park.

Ok.

All right, go!
I'll race you.

Ok.

Careful, careful.
Heels, heels!

Yeah. Yeah.
They're winning.

Look at those two.

Think our matchmaking
might have worked.

Hey!

Your hair's gotten longer.

I always thought
you should grow it out.

And so you're saying you didn't
like it the way it was before?

That's not what I'm saying.

Just think it looks
better now.

Well, I'm gonna get it
cut tomorrow.

Of course you are.

Uh, explain to me why
you guys broke up, again?

Both: We drive
each other crazy.

Ah.

And I always beat you
at pickle ball.

No, you don't.
'Course I do.

That is a gross exaggeration.

I think we should settle
this once and for all.

Mmm.

You got it.
You're on.

B and Ben, choose your weapons.

All right, stand back to back.

Take three paces
and fire at will.

One, two, three!

Fire!


Yes! Come on!

Beatrice!
Oh, good shot.


That was nicely packed.


Oh, direct hit.

Woo hoo!


Stand back, my lady, I will
defend you till the death.

No, no, no, no, ah!


By day she is fair

and the sweetest I have ever
looked upon.

You are such a hopeless
romantic.

Totally hopeless.

Oh!

Truce! Truce.
Truce! Time out.

Are you all right?

I am. Thank you.

So what are you
doing tomorrow?

Something very special,
do you want to join me?

Of course.
Ok.

We make a good team.
Yes, for a snowball fight.

â™ª

You are looking good
in that Santa suit.

I think red's my color.
I think so too.

Ok, wait here.
Ok.

Kids?

I have a surprise for you.
It's Santa Claus!

Ho, ho, ho!

[kids cheering]

Merry Christmas, children!

Kids: Santa!

â™ª

<i>â™ª Here we are, arms
around each other â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The quiet scene,
pretty lights around us â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Snow is falling and
everyone's here tonight â™ª</i>

â™ª

â™ª<i> Santa's sleigh,
bells ringing in the distance</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> So I'm waiting for
the mistletoe and kisses</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> All the lights
are shining brightly</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> Oh, it's a merry Christmas</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> All the bells are ringing
out again</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> 'cause it's Christmas time</i> â™ª

â™ª


Hey, what do you think?

I just pulled it up.

I like the black background.
It really makes the crystal pop.

Yeah, you don't think
it's too stark?

Not at all.

'Cause I was thinking we could
try adding an element

of whimsy to it.

I don't think it needs it.

The trends are all moving
towards minimalistic.

Ok.

What about a lens flair
on the bevel here?

I'll get right on it.

Hey, how's it going
with you and new girl?

Haley?

Great.

Spent all Sunday
in a Santa suit with her

and a bunch
of adorable children.

Yeah, she's amazing.

She's so honest and genuine.

Oh boy.

You're a goner.

Yeah, all right.

â™ª

Needs something else.

Yeah, there we go.

Hey, I'm going for lunch.
You want to come?

Oh, is it that late?

I actually have to pick
something up

but I'll see you in a bit,
yeah?

All right. See ya.

Ok. Yeah.

Hey.
Hi.

Good choice on this blazer.

Well, I just got a new job.

Oh, you did?
Congratulations!

Well you'll definitely impress
your new boss with this.

Thank you, thank you.

How much is that briefcase?

You know what?

It's actually on special.
How does $10 sound?

That sounds just fine.

Ok, I'll take it.
Great.

[door bells jingling]

Hi, Mom.

Hello, sweetheart.

Well, looks like you've been
doing some shopping.

No, these are a donation.

Mom, thank you.
I'm happy to contribute.

Um, when you have a minute

I'd love to go over the budget
for the gala.

Sure. We'll schedule something
this week.

Ok.

So much stuff.

Hi, welcome to the Hope Chest.
Hello.

Wait.

Mom, didn't you just buy these
for you company Christmas party?

Yes, they were torture.

My feet are still recovering.

I almost feel guilty giving them
to someone else.

Speaking of the party,
what did you think of Niles?

I hear he's single.
He's not my type.

Why not? I find him charming.

Well, he wasn't
so charming

when he thought I was a server
at the cocoa cart.

And why did he think that?

Well Dorris was having technical
issues with the machine

and I stepped in to help.

Of course you did.

But, as it so happens,

I did meet someone
at your party.

Oh?

His name is Claude

and we've been seeing each
other for a little while now.

Is it serious?

Maybe?

I'd like to meet him.

Why don't you have him
over to the house for dinner?

Sure.

Um, how about
after the holidays?

I've just, you know I've just
been so busy with the gala.

You're right.
And I have to dash.

Ok.

Thank you so much
for the clothes.

You're welcome.

I love you, Mom.
Thanks.

[phone ringing]

Hey, Karen.
Yes, I'm on my way.

Hey!

You all right?

The color drained from your face
for a second there.

Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

Wow, what do you
got there?

Oh, it's a rescue.

Saw it on the way over.
I couldn't resist.

You're such a sap.

Did you actually buy a Charlie
Brown Christmas tree?

Yes, I did.

Does it have a home?

My office. Do you want
to help me decorate it?

How can I say no to that?

Hi.

How are you doing?
How are you doing, Claude?

Right down the stairs here.
This is so cool.

Welcome to my world.

Well, I share it with Ben
and a couple others but,

you know, they're at lunch.

It is exactly like
I pictured it.

It's arty, groovy, comfy,
just like you.

Comfy?

Are you sure that's
a compliment?

Absolutely.
It means cuddly.

Cuddly?

Then I'll take it.

You don't know how happy
that tree makes me.

Thank you.

You're ridiculously easy
to please, you know that?

How did I get so lucky.

I want to congratulate
your mother

on raising such
an awesome girl.

Oh, I'll tell her.

Well, when can
I meet her?

I can tell her myself.

Um, you know what,
I'll, I'll ask her.

How do you turn this on?

Ah!

You don't like talking
about your mother, do you?

What, you're not close?
No, no, we're very close.

Well what is it then?

You know, you can
tell me anything.

I want us to be able
to trust each other.

Absolutely.

In my last relationship

I discovered she wasn't
an honest person

and I don't really ever want
to go through that again.

Sorry, baggage, but I feel
a connection to you.

Me too.

I have been meaning to share
something with you, Claude.

My mother is actually-

Hey, Claude, there you are!

Back from lunch already?

Uh, yes, just a grab and go.

Don, this is Haley.

Haley. I've heard so much
about you.

All good.

Ah, I hope so!

And this is my brilliant boss,
Don.

I'll try and live up to that.

Claude, can I borrow
your brain for a sec?

I was just rethinking the color
of the font.

Yeah, I can pull it
right up.

Great.

Is it ok if Haley sees this?

Of course, I'd love
to get your opinion.

Uh...

It's for our presentation
with Leona Lloyd.

Oh, when is that?

It's Friday.

I really shouldn't have
an opinion.

What are you talking about?

It's a woman's fragrance.
You're our target audience.

Ok. Um...

Well, what do you think?

It's really nice.
It's clean, it's sleek.

Too clean?

I'm just not an authority
on marketing

and I don't want to say
the wrong thing

and I know how important this
meeting is to your company

and I should probably
just let you guys

get back to work and get
out of your hair.

Oh, you don't have
to do that,

I mean, Claude and I can
finish this later.

Yeah.

You know what, I'm feeling
a little bit light headed, so...

Are you ok?

I can get you some water.

No, I'm fine, I just
didn't sleep very well.

But I'll let you guys
do your creative thing

and it was lovely meeting
you Don, but I'm gonna...

Same here.

Are you...

I'm going to go.
I'll see you later.

I think I've actually made
myself physically nauseous.

Yeah, this should help.

What is it?

Antacid and eggnog.

Uh, that's an icky combo.

I think I'm gonna die.

It's just guilt,
it's not fatal.

I'm a horrible person.

How could I have deceived
Claude like this?

I mean, it all started out
so innocent

and now it's turned into this
big ugly lie that I can't undo.

Why not?

Because he's fallen for
this girl that he thinks I am,

which I am clearly not.

Exactly what did you tell him?

He thinks that I was raised
by a struggling single mother.

Why would he think that?

Because she was single and
it was a struggle for her.

Because she was busy building

a multi-million
dollar corporation?

Yes, which she did
all by herself.

Mm. Still a stretch.

Ok, fine.

But now Claude
and the guys

they have this big pitch meeting
with her

and when they find out
that I'm her daughter

it's going to go south,
like it always does.

Ok, you need to let this
presentation happen

without any interference
then drop the bomb.

Now, I've got to go
get ready.

No, don't leave me,
where are you going?

Out with Ben.

Oh!

It's just casual.

Right, can you just make
sure to not.

Don't worry, I won't
say a word.

Thank you.


I am definitely on
the naughty list.

â™ª

So we've added some vegan
options to the appetizers

and it fits perfectly
in the budget.

Wonderful, so that's all set.

And the committee has landed
some big ticket auction items

and I've been working on a golf
course package at Saint Andrews.

Wonderful.
We're on track.

This is great.
Thank you, darling.

Ah, you're welcome.

Haley, is something
troubling you?

You don't seem
yourself today.

I'm sorry, I'm just...

I need to iron out this
little wrinkle with Claude.

Can I help?

No, I wish you could.

I, I have to figure this out
for myself.

Darling, I know you want to do
everything on your own,

but please know, I'm never
too busy to talk,

if you need me.

Thanks, Mom.
That means a lot.

[knock at door]

The gentlemen
from Blue Skies Agency

are here for their 11:00.

Did you say Blue Skies?

Yes, they're waiting
at the reception.

They're a little early.

We have a few
more minutes.

Um, you know what?
I have to go.

My goodness, why
the sudden rush?

Um, I realize I have a thing,

but I will see you
this weekend.

Bye! Love you!

â™ª

Can I take your coats?

Yes.

Thank you. Cheers.

This has to get to Leona.
It's very important.

Check it out.

Oh, goody. The competition.

Of course.

I'm on it. Thank you.
Good.

Oh, hi Karen, glad I bumped
into you.

I love this outfit by the way.
Very chic.

So you saw our presentation
this morning.

I can't say anything, Niles.

No, no, no, of course not.

I was just hoping to get
your opinion, that's all.

It was a strong pitch.

Well, how about you just
casually mention that to Leona?

You do know our company has
skybox seats at the Winter Dome.

[phone rings]

Excuse me, I have
to take this.

Of course.

Hi.
Hi.

Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.

Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

Hey, you.
Hi.

Nice surprise.
Oh, hi, Niles.

Here to see your mum?
Yeah, just some gala stuff.

Right, right.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me help you with...

Oh, you ok?

Sorry about that.

Let me just have a look at that,
hang on.

No, I'm ok.
A little bump on your head?

Haley?

Oh, hi Claude.
What are you doing here?

It's a really long story.

I thought your meeting was
on Friday?

It got pushed up.

Um, this is Niles.

From Elite Marketing.

Of course. Claude Miller,
Blue Skies.

You guys pitching
the Beguiled account?

Uh, yeah.

Good luck with that one.
We aced ours earlier today.

Leona even asked for some
additional imagery

so I just dropped off a drive.

Claude! What are you doing?
Come on.

Uh, I've got to run.
I'll see you.

Good luck.

What's up?
Are you ok?

Yeah.

Come on then.
It's game time.

Yeah, absolutely, I'm here
for you 100 percent.

Gentlemen.

Leona.

I'm looking forward to seeing
what you have for me.

Hi. Good to see you.
Hello.

You can plug into my screen
over here.

Oh, wonderful.

Ok.

So, who's going to be your date
to the gala then?

That's kind of influx.

Then we should go together.

I can't really commit
to something right now,

but I'll see you later.

Beguiled Beauty,
irresistibly cool.

There you go.

I'm not sure it has
the wow factor.

Oh, by the wow factor
do you mean

the product isn't appealing
enough?

We also have it
without the snow

if you think that dissipates
the crystal facets.

No, the snow is great.

I'm just not connecting
with it emotionally.

Claude.

Well, I have been roughing out
something a little different.

I haven't had the chance
to run it by my team yet.

Well, we can all discover
it together.

Yeah. Show us what you've got,
Claude.

All right.

So, I was thinking...

Beguiled Beauty.
Encounter the magic.

Is this a joke?

Uh, no.

Where did you get the model?

That's my girlfriend.
She's not actually a model.

No, she most certainly is not.
She is my daughter.

And I don't appreciate
you trying to use her

to gain an advantage
with me.

No, no, there must be
some mistake.

Are you talking about
Haley Logan?

She's Haley Logan Lloyd.

Has she even seen this?

No, no. I just, I took this
candid shot,

and I thought it worked well
for the picture.

Leona, I'm so sorry
if we've offended you.

We didn't know.

Did we, Claude?

Claude?

This is all making sense now.

Are you telling me that Haley
hasn't told you who I am?

No, she hasn't.

I can't tell you how profoundly
disappointing that is.

Excuse me.

Ok. There has to be a way
to salvage this situation.

If we switched out the model,
would this idea work for you?

Ben.

I'm afraid your time is up.

Thank you for the meeting.

<i>[jazzy holiday music]
â™ª</i>

Are you sure Claude
saw you?

Positive.

He was going into a meeting
with my mom

while I was waiting for
the elevator with Niles.

What were you doing
with Niles?

He was asking me to be his date
for the gala.

And?

I said no, of course.
Good.

But imagine what it must
have looked like to Claude.

Or more importantly, did Claude
make the connection

between you
and your mom?

I don't know.

I mean, I texted him and
he hasn't texted me back yet.

[notification alert]

Is that him?
No, it's my mom.

And?

She wants me to meet her
at the house.

I wonder what that's about.

I'm afraid to ask.

<i>You should try Claude again.</i>

[notification alert]

Over there.

Well, mate.

Hey.

Well that couldn't have gone
any worse.

I'm sorry guys,
because of me

we practically handed the
account to Elite Marketing.

It's not your fault.

I thought your layout
was brilliant, by the way.

You were right on target.

Thank you, I just wish Leona
had felt the same.

I can't believe she's
Haley's mother.

I don't know what
Haley's game is,

but I don't want any part of it.

She try to reach you?

Yeah, I have nothing to say
to her.

Don't you want to give her
a chance to explain?

A chance to explain what?
She fabricated her entire life.

I feel like such an idiot.

Ok, buddy.

It may be not the best time
to be throwing darts.

Why don't you sit down.

I shouldn't have used
that picture of Haley.

I've totally blown
our chances.

No, I told you to use it.

It is what it is.

Let it go.


So, we didn't get the account.

What does this mean
for Blue Skies?

It's gotten a little cloudy.

â™ª

<i>Voicemail: Hello,
this is Claude.</i>

<i>Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

Hi Claude, it's me again.

I really need to talk to you,
can you please call me back?

Ok, thanks.

Good afternoon, Haley.

Hi, Gordon.

So, how are you today?

I'm fine.

Your mother's expecting you.

Ok. Thank you, Gordon.

She's in her study.

How is she?

It's not for me to say.

Great.

Hi, Mom.

Haley. Please sit down.

Would you like some tea?

No, thank you.
Um, is everything all right?

The strangest thing
happened today.

I met with a young man in
my office whom as it turns out

has been dating my daughter
for some time.

But, somehow, he had no idea
I was her mother.

Do you care to explain
this anomaly?

Mom, I'm sorry.

Are you ashamed of me?

No, of course not.

He knows you as
Haley Logan.

Is that the name you're going
by these days?

Only with Claude.

It's, it's not the way
that you think.

So you didn't mislead him?

I didn't do it on purpose.

It just, it sort of happened and
then I couldn't take it back.

I know it hasn't been easy
for you, being my daughter.

But I want you to remember
something,

when your father left us,
we had to start from scratch.

I never wanted you to be
in that position,

to have to rely on someone else
for your livelihood.

I built this life and
this company for us.

For our future.

And it was very tough,
but we persevered, didn't we?

Mom, you sacrificed so much
for me and I'm truly grateful.

And when I walk
into that building,

and see our name
up on that wall,

I think of what we overcame
to get there.

And we did it together.

That is something
I am very proud of.

And you should be too.

I am.

I am so proud of you, Mom.

I know that we are
two different women.

You don't like the spotlight.

I've come to terms with that.

But please, don't hide
from who you are.

Guys always treat me differently
the minute they find out

and I just wanted things
to be different with Claude.

Nevertheless, you'll never be
able to hold onto a relationship

without honesty and trust.

You are Haley Lloyd.

Claude needs to accept that,

or he's not the right person
for you.

I didn't even give him
a chance.

Oh, that's too bad.

So, I'm assuming Blue Skies
didn't get the account?

No, I practically threw them
out of the office.

It's awful.

How do I fix this?

Follow your heart.

It's a beautiful one.

â™ª

Haley.
Hi, Ben.

You're here to see Claude?

Yeah.

He left for the night.

Said he needed
to take a walk.

I think I know where he went.

Ok. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

I thought I might find
you here.

I'm sorry to interrupt
your moment of solitude

but you haven't been returning
my calls.

Do you mind if I join you?

I went by your office.

I saw that you're taking
good care

of the Charlie Brown
Christmas tree.

Yeah. It doesn't ask for much.

Claude, please just let me
explain what happened.

It's pretty simple,
isn't it?

You're not who you say
you are.

I never meant to hurt you.

Well what did you think
was going to happen?

You can't just make up
a whole new life

anytime you want to be
someone else.

Things are never the same when
people find out who I really am.

They never are.

You don't know that.

Look, just try to understand.

For the first time in my life

I caught a glimpse of
what it might feel like

to be a girl name Haley,

not the heir to
Lloyd Industries.

But, the girl that went
to elf camp

and served hot cocoa
and had snowball fights.

I never thought that I would
meet somebody like you

but I did and what we had
was so amazing.

And I didn't want to risk
losing that, risk losing you.

How long were you going
to keep up the act?

I tried telling you in your
office but then Don showed up

and you both wanted
my opinion on the pitch

and it put me in a terribly
awkward position.

How so?

Because I knew how important
the meeting was to you

and how it could
save Blue Skies

or even make or break
your career.

So instead you humiliated me
in front of your mother,

my boss and my best friend.

If you knew that Leona Lloyd
was my mother,

you don't think that you would
have used me for an inside edge?

Come on, Claude, isn't that
a real possibility?

I would never have used you
like that.

But I guess you'll never
know that for certain,

because you took that decision
away from me.

I don't know who I fell
in love with,

but it wasn't you.

You fell in love?

Doesn't matter.

It wasn't real.

It was to me.

â™ª

You hung it backwards.

Am I that bad?

I just miss your Christmas glow.
That's all.

Me too.

So it's definitely over
between you and Haley?

No chance of patching
things up?

Well, I'm here for you,
buddy.

If you ever want
to talk about it.

Thank you.

That means a lot.

Want half my cookie?

Sure.

There you go.

â™ª

â™ª

If anything changes,

you'll be the first person
I call.

Good luck.
Thanks.

Sorry mate,
best of luck.

Thanks guys.

Good luck, buddy.

â™ª

â™ª

Here you go.

Thanks, where's yours?

I'm eating half of yours.

Oh.

So, what are you wearing
to the gala?

I hadn't thought about it.

Haley, it's this weekend.

Yeah, I'll figure something out.

I'm calling your mom
for wardrobe assistance.

Ok, fine.

â™ª

I can't understand how
you would leave it

until the last minute
like this.

I ordered my gown
two months ago.

See? Take a cue
from your friend.

Look, it doesn't matter
what I wear,

I don't have a date
anyway, so...

But it's the grand benefit
for the Hope Chest

and you're the big cheese.

Darling, listen to me.

You don't need a date

to stand up and be proud
of your achievements

and everything they stand for.

She's right.

It's your night, and if I have
anything to do with it,

you're going to look radiant.

I'm not sure if
it's the right size,

but it has a lovely silhouette.

Thanks, Mom.

How's she doing?

She's been better.

Hmm. I don't know what
to do to help.

I feel like I'm part of
the problem.

It's not you.

Should I intervene?

I would hold off on that
for now.

Just let the dust settle.

Oh, hey.

What do you think?

Good fit!

Drab color.

Perfect.
Matches my mood.

The boots don't help.

We can't have that.
Let's try the red.

Great. Let's do the red.

So, what are you up to tonight?

A frozen dinner
and some laundry?

Wow, exciting.

Yeah.

Ben, Claude, could you
come to my office a second?

Guys...

The Davrows account
didn't go through.

Ah, bummer.

Anyway, I thought maybe
we could try once more

to reset things with Leona.

I bought tickets to
the Christmas gala.

I hoped we could all
go together.

Anything you need.

Great.

What about you, Claude?

This is Haley's event.

I think I should sit
this one out.

Of course.
I understand. I...

[cell phone rings]

Sorry. I have to take this.
We'll talk tomorrow?

Sure.

â™ª

Hi, pick up for Haley.

Haley, hi.

You really have to stop
following me.

I'm just here
to grab some food.

So, are you going to let me take
you to your gala or what?

Uh, thank you, but I have
to set up early.

Isn't that what
the hired help is for?

Uh, no. It's a charity
and we're volunteering.

Ok, but you still need
a date.

Thank you, but I don't have
time for one.

Ok, save me a dance though?

<i>Server: Here you are.</i>

Oh, thank you.

Sure.

â™ª

Don and I are cutting
out early,

so you're on your own.

Yeah.

Hey, I've been thinking.

It would be great if you
could bite the bullet

and come with us tonight.

I know Haley's
gonna be there

and you could take a minute
to talk things over.

Talk what over?
I'm done being played.

Do you really think Haley's
been playing you?

Be honest with yourself,
because from my perspective

what you two had seemed
pretty authentic.

Yeah.

Well, something to think about.

You know I can't go.

All right. I understand.

So, see ya.

Here you go.

Oh, yes.
Thank you, Gordon.

Oh, you landed the Saint Andrews
golf excursion?

I did.

Wow, Mom, that dress
is a knockout.

Thank you.

I'll have to have you cut me
out of it later.

Ms. Lloyd?

I'll be right there.

Haley, please, get dressed.

Yes. I will as soon as the
children's choir gets here,

I want to make sure
they're settled.

Wait, I need those
flowers!

Here dear, let me
help you.

Thank you, Dorris.

No problem at all.
How're you doing?

Is everything going well with
that handsome young man

from the Christmas party?

Unfortunately he's out
of the picture.

Is he really?

Your eyes had a such a sparkle
in them when you met him.

They did?
Oh yes.

Maybe you can get it back.

I don't see how.

It's Christmas.
Miracles do happen.

â™ª

â™ª<i> It looks a lot like Christmas
to me</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª<i> Though I can see where
you might disagree</i> â™ª

Oh, ok. Wow.

They have got to get a
nicer entrance for this place.

Next time we'll use
the helipad.

Is there one?
Yeah, it's out back.

Haley really
was withholding.

Oh, stop it. She doesn't care
about any of that stuff.

I would.


â™ª<i> It looks a lot like
Christmas from here.</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª<i> Maybe just because
I have you near.</i> â™ª

Thank you.

Oh, look at this.
It's beautiful.

I better go see
if Don's here yet.

Ok, I'll find Haley.

That is the best one
I've heard all evening.

Oh, excuse me.

Beatrice, have you
seen Haley?

I'm starting to get worried.

I was just gonna
go check on her.

Can you try upstairs?

Sure.
Thank you.

â™ª

â™ª<i> Maybe just because
I have you near</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> Oh, there's not
a spot of snow</i> â™ª

â™ª<i> Not a drop of holly
or mistletoe</i> â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª<i> There's a kind
of magic...</i> â™ª

Hey, looking sharp.

Ben. Thank you for coming.
It means a lot.

Oh, well, you're welcome.

Hey, don't know
if you noticed

but there's a fabulous party
going on downstairs,

and you're in your bathrobe.

You're crying?

The zipper's stuck.


You look beautiful.

Thank you.

Here, let me.

There. Fixed.

But, I don't think the zipper
is why you're upset.

Oh, B.

I really messed things up
with Claude.

I mean, you warned me
and I didn't listen.

Hey, don't beat yourself up.

Let's focus on what
you've done right.

You organized this
awesome event,

big success,
huge turnout.

Let's go!

Is that your pep talk?

I had to keep it short.
Your mom is freaking out.

You're such an amazing
friend.

Thank you and I love you.

Oh, that's not fair.

You look gorgeous even with
half your makeup cried off.

Oh.


All right, help me
in this dress.

â™ª

Can you believe that?
Have you been to Monte Carlo?

And cue the competition.

Let's just stay positive,
shall we?

Are you excited about tonight?

Choir: Yes!

Haley's ready.

Oh, thank goodness.

Ladies and gentlemen,

it is my pleasure to introduce
you to your host,

Leona Lloyd.


Good evening everyone
and merry Christmas!

Guests: Merry Christmas!

Welcome to Winterstone's
annual charity Christmas gala,

We have a magical evening

But first, I'd like you to meet
the founder of the Hope Chest,

she's the heart and soul of
this wonderful organization

and I'm proud to say
she is also my daughter.

Please help me give a warm
welcome to Haley Lloyd,

and a special surprise,

Bravo, Haley Lloyd.

Well done,
you're wonderful.

Thanks.

Oh, honey, that
was phenomenal.

Oh, Mom.

It was fantastic.
They were so cute.

Oh, thanks B.

Well done, honey.

Wow.

Claude?

You're here.

It's good to see you.

I couldn't leave you guys
high and dry.

Have you had a chance
to speak with Leona?

No, not yet.

Hang on, one second.

Hey, gorgeous.

I just talked my company
into outbidding half the room

at the silent auction table.

Niles, that's so incredibly
generous, thank you.

How about that dance
that you promised me?

Sure.

Shall we?
Ok.

â™ª

<i>[classical music]
â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

Hi, guys.
Hey.

Everything all right?

Yeah.

Oh, sorry, you two
haven't met.

This is my boss, Don.
Don, this is Beatrice.

Pleased to meet you,
Beatrice.

Nice to meet you.

I think the Beguiled account
is a lock.

For extra insurance,

Niles is currently charming
Leona's daughter,

which can only help.

Wonderful party.
Oh, thank you.

What are you doing in here?

Ah, hello. I was just stepping
out for some air.

Oh.

I'm happy to have a chance
to speak with you.

It seems we find ourselves
in similar circumstances.

We both let our emotions
cloud our judgement.

Don't think I follow.

You're a talented
young man.

To tell the truth,

your take on the Beguiled
concept

was the best one presented
to me.

Thank you.

I should have given you and
your team a second chance.

Don't you agree?

I do.

Then you shall have it.

That, that would be
much appreciated.

And what about my daughter?
What about Haley?

Doesn't she deserve
another chance?

I've been asking myself
the same question.

The question you
should be asking is,

do you love her?

<i>[waltz playing]
â™ª</i>

â™ª


One more?

May I?

Claude?

Young man,
I'd love a dance.

No, I'm good thank you.

Are you sure about that?

From what I hear,
you've been a little naughty.

I didn't think you'd come.

Neither did I.

I'm so sorry.

It's all right.

I made such a mistake with you.

I didn't give you the benefit of
the doubt and it's unforgivable

and you're such
a beautiful person

and you deserve truth
and honesty

and I wish, I wish I could
just press the reset button

and start all over.

So why can't you?

What?

Why can't we start over?

Ok.

Great. I'm Claude,
son of Otis Miller,

amateur barbecue champion
of Keswick

and soul heir to his
prized brisket meat trimmer.

And you are?

I'm Haley, daughter of
Leona Lloyd

and soul heir of her company
and this house.

Ah, yes, the fixer upper.

Yes.

Great. So now that that's over,
would you like to dance?

I would love that.

â™ª

You look like someone stole
your school lunch money.

Leona! I was just about to...

Ask me to dance?

Of course. How did you know?

Hey, you're leading.
Well, someone's got to.

Well, how about
we trade off?

Ok, go ahead.

â™ª

Smooth move.

â™ª

About our botched
presentation...

No need to explain.

I've worked it all
out with Claude.

Huh.

Why don't you and your team
come and see me on Monday?

Brilliant!

â™ª

Do you remember when I asked you
what you wanted for Christmas?

Yes.

Well, if you don't answer now,
it might be too late.

All I wanted for Christmas
is you.

Then you have your wish,

because I've fallen hopelessly
in love with you, Haley Lloyd.

That's really good news,

because I'm madly in love
with you, Claude Miller.

Well then it's a very, very
merry Christmas for us both.
