           [Silence]            

   >>Sorry about the traffic.   

   It's not usually that bad.   

    Always gotta be careful     
   on the turn by Mulholland.   

            Come on!            

    Let me show you around.     

    We have five bathrooms,     

         six bedrooms,          

        one living room,        

      hot tub downstairs,       

          guest house,          

        12,000 sq. feet,        
     all at your disposal.      

An absolute steal for the price.

    But I just want to show     
       you the backyard.        

     You are just going to      
      die when you see it.      

        This way please.        

         >>I must say,          
         this is nice.          

           >>Honey...           

    you are not supposed to     
     complement the house.      

    I mean, they always want    
      you to pay more when      

     they know you like it.     

        >>Charles, c'mon        
        this is amazing.        

       >>You're just not        
       going to be happy        

        till the counter        
      offer breaks us in.       

   Okay, Let's cut the crap.    

     I'm assuming the price     
     is so low because....      

      of some dead person       

      >>The previous owner      
           allegedly            

    murdered someone in the     
     home a few years ago.      

         But they never         
        found the body.         

          >>Good Lord!          

       >>You're kidding!        

     >>Stephanie Halstead,      
        a young actress.        

    All the press ate it up,    

        all the hoopla.         

     It's all we heard for      
          a long time.          

   Then one day, people just    
     seem to lose interest.     

        Now, no one even        
      mentions it anymore.      

     >>Now, it makes sense.     

      >>Oh, did I mention       
          you get the           

   furniture with the house?    

   Worth easily 50,000 alone.   

 >>Honey, I am not sure I could 

       live here knowing        
         what happened.         

     >>You can buy it as a      
      tear-down, rebuild!       

           That's ok!           

  Look, if you have the time,   

     there's another place      
        10 minutes away.        

  It's Beverly Hills adjacent,  

     not the big BH proper.     

        >>What about the        
          foundation?           

     I mean the structure,      

       the roof, you know       
          the plumbing          

      >>Tip-top, all of it      

    For someone who can get     

   over the house's history,    

     it really is a steal.      

        I guarantee you,        
      if you don't buy it,      

       someone else will.       

      >>We're interested.       

       >>Maybe we should        
        talk about this.        

   >>Honey, this is the dream   
  house you've always wanted.   

    And, it's Beverly Hills.    

    We are not going to find    

       anything like this       
     cheaper anywhere else.     

    >>Sweety, people die in     
      houses all the time.      

      At least your's was       
          a celebrity.          

    Let's head back inside,     

      i'll get some great       
           champagne.           

      >>Ah, no. I haven't       
            touched             

      a drop in 26 years.       

      >>Oh I'll get you a       
        Shirley Temple.         

     >>I have good news. We     
    are putting in an offer.    

      >>I thought you said      
       you had good news.       

 >>That's it, no more waiting,  
        no more moving,         

       no more going from       
         home to home.          

      >>Glad you're happy.      

      >>C'mon sweetheart,       
       give it a chance!        

            >>Fine!             

      >>That's the spirit!      

      Where are you going?      

      I could use a little      
           help here.           

        [Phone ringing]         

        >>Hey Danielle,         
    so how's the new place?     

       >>It's so boring.        

      You have to drive 20      
    minutes to get anywhere.    

    >>Take some photos cause    
     I want to see it okay?     

         And you missed         
          Junior Prom.          

  >>I know, I'm so pissed that  
   they moved when they did.    

     They messed everything     
           up for me;           

     my friends, my grades.     

  >>Have you had any relapses   
    since you've been there?    

       >>I've been okay.        

        >>Oh, Danielle,         
    I'm so sorry I gotta go     

   but I love it that you're    
     representing the 415.      

       Don't ever change        
       the area code, ok?       

         >>Bye, Shelly.         

         [Dog barking]          

         [Dog barking]          

         [Dog barking]          

         [Dog barking]          

        >>Where are you?        

     >>I'm in the driveway.     

      Do you have to call       
       me from the house?       

    >>Mom, there is somebody    

      in the guest house.       

      >>That's impossible.      
          It's locked.          

       >>Mom, I know what       
             I saw.             

      >>I have two hundred      
        boxes to unpack.        

        Can we play this        
       little game later?       

        >>Oh God! Jesus.        
         You scared me.         

      Don't do that again.      

       >>I'm sorry Danni.       

      This is gonna be my,      
       my new home office       

   I, I haven't had a chance,   
           you know,            

       to move everything       

    out and get cleaned up.     

        Danni, could you        
         do me a favor?         

      Could, could you go       
        check the mail?         

   I, I am kind of expecting    
      something important.      

       I was wondering if       
       you could just go        

  see if it's come in or not.   

            >>Yeah.             
   >>I really appreciate it.    

          Thanks Danni          

      Ah! Danni, the key.       

          Thanks kid!           

             >>Hey!             

           >>O Jeez!            
         You scared me.         

            >>Sorry             
    That's probably because     

       you couldn't hear        
   me over all that traffic.    

     It's a mess but you'll     
        get used to it.         

             >>Hi,              
         >>I'm Natalie,         

    Ii live two houses down.    

   Welcome to Beverly Hills.    

  Land of the rich and Snobby.  

     >>I am Danielle Myers      

    from San Francisco and -    

  >>Oh! I love San Francisco.   

           >>Oh God,            
             Sorry.             

 >>Daddy only takes the stairs  
      whenever he needs to      

       see? He only eats        
    the really fresh stuff.     

   >>You didn't happen to see   
      any homeless people       

   living in our house before   
       we moved in right?       

     >>No,it's been vacant      
       since the murder.        

            >>What ?            

    >>Let's try and find the    
        Halstead house.         

            >>Hello!            
    This is someone's house.    

   >>Well I don't know that!    

     >>What are they doing?     

          >>Ugh creep           
   >>What was that all about?   

          >>Tourists.           
      I blame them for all      

   the traffic in this town.    

 So, you really don't know what 

        happened here a         
      couple of years ago?      

           >>Nuh-uh.            

     You mean your parents      
       didn't tell you ?        

             >>No.              
           >>Oh wow!            

      You're gonna want to      
     sit down for this one.     

         >>Is it warm ?         
          >>Yeah, no!           

       I don't think the        
      heaters are working.      

   >>Okay, well I'm a weanie    
     so I'm gonna sit here.     

 Well, it looks pretty though.  

     >>So tell me about the     
    night that it happened.     

             Okay.              
    So, the night she died,     

          we actually           
        heard it happen.        

     I mean, we didn't know     
      he was killing her,       

      we just thought they      
        were having sex.        

        They were always        
          having loud,          

        crazy, rough sex        
      out on the balcony.       

       So we just thought       
      there they go again       

  but, I was trying to sleep.   

        A girl needs her        
          beauty rest!          

           So I kept            
        bothering daddy,        

         and finally he         
        called the cops.        

          But, by then          
        it was too late.        

       He had killed her        
        and he was gone.        

     >>So how did she die?      

       >>You know what, I       
      actually heard that       

      he crushed her body       
     with a sledge hammer,      

        cut her up into         
         little pieces,         

        stuffed her into        
          the suitcase          

        and then buried         
       her in the desert,       

     And he's such a creep.     
       She was pregnant.        

         He killed his          
         unborn child.          

       After the murder,        

        the neighborhood        
        was swarmed with        

         with paparazzi         
           and press.           

      And they all started      
           calling it           

      "Cold Blood Canyon."      

     It's kinda creepy when     
      you think about it,       

      because your parents      
          share taste           

    in house with a psycho.     

       But yeah, welcome        
      to the neighborhood.      

           >> Thanks.           

           Come here!           

    Wanna go on a walk huh?     

           Let's see,           
          dishes here.          

   I always leave it in here.   

  Why does everything in this   
    house keep disappearing?    

       >>C'mon hurry up.        

       It's a great dog,        

       what kind is it ?        

       >>It's a shih tzu,       

       named it Mai Tai.        

     >>Your parents aren't      
    alcoholics or something?    

        >>Yeah, well...         

       >>Well, tough huh?       

         It's my mom's.         

   >>Uh huh, always a friend.   

   >>It's my mom's. I swear.    

          >>It's okay.          

     I feel like a guy that     
     has a metrosexual side     

         is kinda cool.         

    >>Well, I did, you know,    
  go with her to pick it out.   

     >>So, you live around      
           here or...           

       >>I just moved in.       

       >>You have to give       
         me your number         

   so I can show you around.    

     LA is an awesome place     
            when you            

         know where to          
           go and...            

            [Laughs]            

             >>Mom!             

   Charles, Charles, you are    
    not going to believe me.    

      I know you are going      
      to think I'm crazy,       

    but there is a ghost or     
     something in my room.      

         >>Now, Danny,          

        I prefer dad, or        
         Mr. Myers, or          

           how about            
         Your Majesty?          

         >>You are not          
          my real dad!          

        >>Please Danni,         

      it would mean a lot       
             to me.             

  I know that by now, you have  
     probably heard rumours     

        about this place        
         being haunted.         

    But Danni girl, that's,     
      that's all they are,      

     they are just rumours.     

       >>You are not even       
        listening to me.        

     There is something....     
           >>Danielle           

            are you             
        trying to start         

          a miserable           
         evening here?          

  >>You are being a real jerk.  

      >>I'm sorry that you      
      feel so hostile but       

       even if this place       
          was haunted,          

        it will take an         
         awful lot more         

       to get us out than       
  some fuc...fricking ghosts.   

         >>That's easy          
        for you to say.         

 Your nailpolish isn't getting  
       thrown everywhere.       

      >>Why don't you come      
     on down to my office?      

      You can get your ego      
         and integrity          

     thrown around instead.     

      C'mon Danni be nice!      

   If you don't have family,    

       what do you have?        

            Hey mom!            

     >>I think she married      
       him for his money.       

      >>Isn't that kind of      
            whorish?            

     >>Not in Beverly Hills     
      That's trendy here.       

        >>Natalie, money        
      can't buy happiness.      

  >>Yeah! Well it sure helps!   

     Money is my mom's way      
     of saying I love you.      

      >>At least your mom       
        says I love you.

        not telling me?         

           >>Oh, God!           

          >>Say you'll          
         get rid of it.         

            Say it!             

     >>I'm pregnant, okay?      

  >>Say you'll get rid of it.   

            Say it!             

            [Grunts]            

      I'll take you to the      
         doctor, again.         

        Problem solved.         

          >>I want it.          
          You want it.          

      I told you, I don't       
           need you.            

    >>Doctor's office, time     
        and time again.         

    I specifically told you.    

         This was never         
         gonna happen.

       >>Danni! Thank God       
         you're alive.          

 I was worried the Ghost would  
    possess you or something    

     and turn you into some     
        kind of asshole!        

           I'm sorry!           

       Please forgive me.       
             Okay ?             

       >>I really needed        
        you last night.         

           >>I know.            

       >>The attacks are        
         getting worse.         

      I don't know why she      
     hasn't killed me yet.      

   >>I have something to show   
       you that may help.       

   >>I felt really bad about    
 leaving you and so I stayed up 

    all night and I tried to    
      find a way to help.       

    Got it off this website.    

   He's trying to raise money   
     for his next project.      

        >>I think he is         
    planning to kill again.     

       I think that's why       
   Stephanie did this to me,    

  maybe a business associate,   
       possibly revenge,        

I don't know. All I know is that
 Stephanie wants me to stop it. 

      >>But, why would he       
      want to kill again ?      

>>Possibly, to bail himself out 
     of his money problems.     

    >>Why would he do that ?    

    All eyes are already on     
     him from the last time     

       he killed someone.       

      >>Unless, he knows a      
 way to cover it up this time.  

        >>Maybe, he has         
       a new girlfriend.        

    >>Why would he get money    
 from killing his girlfriend ?  

  >>Maybe... it's his fiancee   
       and he is engaged        

   and he's gonna collect the   
     money from Insurance,      

         I don't know.          

       >>Yikes! I thought       
     Cold Water was noisy.      

           >>I know.            

    >>So, that's his house ?    

             >>Yup!             
      >>Serious downgrade.      

        >>How is he even        
     able to afford a house     

 after the lawyers drained him? 

        >>So, what now ?        
        We look around ?        

  >>Its early. His neighbours   
   should be at work, right?    

            >>Yeah.             

    >>so? Sneak around back.    

    >>What are you smoking?     

         And why didn't         
           you share?           

        >>Come on, Nat.         
          Let's do it.          

           >>Come on.           

      >>I don't like this.      

      This is a bad idea.       

         You know what?         
      This is a bad idea.       

 >>Ugh! It smells like there's  
       some crap in here.       

          >>Let's go.           

   >>Natalie, don't do this.    
            >>Sorry.            

       >>It smells worse        
           over here.           

            Oh God!             

        [Both Shrieking]        

            [Puking]            

   >>Do you feel better now?    

         >>Not really.          

  I've just never seen a dead   
     body before, you know.     

         And it's just          
         kinda intense.         

           >>You know           
        what's intense?         

How long it takes to find a damn

        payphone in this        
          day and age.          

    How's a girl supposed to    
 make an anonymous phone call?  

             Jesus!             

   My therapist better clear    
      a whole ear for me.       

     >>What are you doing?      

       >>Checking out the       
         other station.         

            [Radio]             

   Damn! You are going to be    
 hearing about this for years.  

I'm sorry I just feel like such 
     a screw-up, you know?      

    And nothing's gone right    
     since I moved up here.     

          >>Oh, shush.          

     Everyone goes through      
        stuff like this.        

      Minus the dead body.      

       It just takes time       
           to adjust.           

           Seriously.           

     Soon enough, you'll be     
       seeing dead bodies       

      everywhere you go in      
       L.A.and you won't        

    even notice it anymore.     

           >>O. M. G.           

 >>Natalie, did you call them?  

           >>No, no.            

       >>Just don't talk        
         to them okay?          

            Natalie?            

            >>Okay.             

        [Unintelligible]        

    >>When did you find out     
       about the murder?        

    How did the police know     
       it was a suicide?        

        How do you sleep        
           at night?            

       >>My friend has no       
     comment, but I'm free.     

     You can call my agent.     

        [Unintelligible]        

         >>Relax, dude.         

         >>Guys, guys!          

      >>Let him go, Jeff!       
          Let him go!           

   >>Who's your little friend   
             Danni?             

       >>Will you please        
    take this inside before     

      the media decides to      
     air it on national TV?     

   >>Well it depends on what    
   your relationship is then.   

      >>We're just friends      
             Jeff.              

     >>Really ? Cause when      
      I asked,he told me,       

          he was your           
           boyfriend.           

            >>Right             

      >>Well, I mean we're      
        friends and....         

        >>Can we please         
       take this inside,        

      two of you now ? Go!      

             Eddy.              
             Stop.              

       Can I get anybody        
      something to drink ?      

     >>Just an explanation      
         would be fine          

         >>What are you         
          doing here ?          

       >>We were supposed       
     to meet today to talk      

      about the exorcism.       

       >>Are you freaking       
          kidding me ?          

    Seriously, What the hell    
         are you doing          

    with this little turd ?     

  >>Jeff, I have been through   
       hell today, okay?        

       I don't need your        
        bull right now.         

       I just need you to       
         be supportive          

         >>I should be          
          supportive ?          

       Father Gayman here       
         so that he can         

     baptize your genitals.     

      >>It's not like that      
           >>Really ?           

        Then how is it ?        

       Because, what am I       
      supposed to think ?       

        When I come over        
        here to see you         

   and I see this guy saying    
     he is your boyfriend.      

   >>It's not like that okay!   
      We're just friends.       

    And even if he was, why     
    would it matter to you ?    

   You're never around here.    

     You're always hanging      
     out with your buddies.     

            >>Yeah!             

         >>Nat please.          
         I got it okay!         

       >>I want this ass        
          out of here.          

     >>I'm sorry Jeff, but      
   that's not your decision.    

        >>I'm gonna go.         

    >>No, Eddie stay, we've     
      business to discuss.      

        Jeff, apologize.        

     >>Are you kidding me ?     

    >>You're serious. Screw     
     that. I'm out of here.     

       >>Jeff, come back.       

          Jeff, wait.           

       >>Lovebirds, what        
          can you do!           

 Jeff, I know that you're going 
    to think that I'm crazy     

   but this house is haunted.   

     I have seen Stephanie      
    Halstead's ghost, okay ?    

           It's real            
       And I need Eddie.        

       He is the only one       
        that believes me        

       and he has offered       
            to help.            

        There is nothing        
      going on, I promise.      

    >>Whatever man, the guy     
     inside, he wants you.      

        >>In a couple of        
   hours, Nat's gonna be gone   

       and Eddie is gonna       
          be gone too.          

        I need you to do        
       me a favor, okay?        

      It's my parents last      
       night out of town        

     and I just don't want      
      to stay here alone.       

     I need someone here to     
        protect me okay!        

        Will you please         
           come back?           

             Thanks             

     >>Okay, for your sake,     
     i hope that was water.     

     >>What if she tries to     
       possess us Eddy ?        

     >>It's very difficult.     

    For a spirit to actually    
       take over a body,        

    okay, based on what I've    
    read, it takes a lot of     

   energy from a spirit, they   
      don't normally have.      

    >>I don't think you know    
   what you're talking about.   

    >>A ghost has to want to    
       enter you and you        

      usually have to want      
        it to enter you.        

      Okay, then the ghost      
       has to figure out        

          how to live           
         inside of you.         

    And your spirit, you're     
      gonna have to leave       

       or be forced out.        

  >>I think it's a lot easier   
     than you think it is.      

     >>Even Mother Theresa      
  underwent an exorcism, back   

          in Calcutta,          
         back in 2001.          

       Ghosts want their        
          lives back.           

      Okay, but if they're      
          left behind,          

       it's for a reason.       

      They're on a mission      
          to recapture          

 something that was once lost.  

      I mean, it could be       
           permanent.           

    >>Is all this rigamorole    
       really necessary?        

      I have a wedding to       
    get ready for tomorrow?     

  >>Do not let a spirit inside  
      of you voluntarily.       

        It won't leave.         

   >>Okay, someone had a bowl   
    of cuckoo for breakfast.    

    >>I think we should just    
        get on with it.         

   >>Then we just gotta burn    
     the incense and circle     

        around the guest        
        house six times.        

        >>Great! Just in        
        time for dinner.        

         And that's it?         
            >>Yeah.             

        >>And how do we         
       know if it worked?       

       >>When junk stops        
         flying around,         

         you're golden.         

      Just so you know, if      
      you get bored later,      

          let me know.          

        I may be around.        

    >>Alright, thanks Eddie.    

     >>Ohh hello, I'll talk     
         to you later.          

          >>Bye, Nat.           

       >>Oh, don't forget       
           your ABCs.           

            >>What?             
    >>Always bring condoms.     

    Go home you dirty slut.     

       Natalie, go home.        

             >>Bye!             

     Is that another yawn ?     

   >>No, stretching the jaw!    

    >>I'm sorry to bore you.    

        I hope that's a         
         water balloon.         

     >>Kind of...sort of..      
            >>Yeah!             

      Jeff can we kind of       
       just take it slow?       

            [Sighs]             

      >>Any other orders,       
           Mussolini?           

           >>Behave.            

       >>I am, that's the       
            problem.            

            Oh shit!            
            >>What ?            

     >>I just saw a woman.      

            >>O God!            
            A ghost!            

      >>Oh it didn't work.      

          I know Jeff!          

     Now do you know why I      
       have been so eager       

     to have you come over      
     here and protect me ?      

    >>Why don't you call the    
     cops or do something ?     

        Why are you just        
      sitting there for ?       

     >>I have been sitting      
     here for so long now.      

    >>I gotta go. I mean, I     
     have got something to      

     take care of at home.      

        >>Fine, go ahead        
          and go Jeff.          

       Are you happy huh?       

         God, just get          
        out of my life.         

     What does it take for      
    you to leave me alone ?     

          Hey Jan, hi           
     um... it's me, Danni.      

     Yeah, I was wondering      
    if I could stay with you    

        guys for awhile.        

  No, hey can um can you guys   
 pick me up at the bus station? 

     Okay, okay thank you.      

        I love you too.         

  I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.   

    Hey Charles, what is it     
      that you are hiding       

     from me in here huh ?      
              Huh?              

       Why don't you let        
          me in here ?          

  There's nothing in here that  
     you should be hiding.      

        What the hell do        
       you want from me ?       

     My mom already thinks      
        that I'm crazy.         

         You terrified          
         my boyfriend.          

         You know what,         
          I hate you!           

      What, now you don't       
       want to play huh ?       

             Huh ?              

 >>August 4th, my relationship  
         with Stephanie         

      has pulled me out of      
      my depressive state.      

     I have decided to tell     
     her about the journey      

         I have made in         
      reaching the occult.      

  I have become obsessed with   
  finding a way to cheat death  

  and if necessary, Stephanie   
  may have to be my guinea pig  

 to test out some of the things 
   that I've already learned.

   my ongoing experimentation   
   in contacting the dead to    

   achieve life everlasting.    

   Steph seems to be getting    
    into it as much as I am.    

      It's good to have a       
       partner in crime.        

      Unfortunately, we've      
    had to go through a lot     

    of con artists before we    
were able to find the real deal,

   spending millions on a lot   
       of this nonsense,        

      hoping it would pay       
      off in the long run.

            Shut up!            

       [Door Bell rings]        

       You make one sound       
 and I'll kill whoever is there 

      and then I come back      
      here and I decorate       

      that wall with your       
        mother's brains.        

         Are we clear ?         

         Nod your head.         

           Good Girl.

      >>Sir, I'm sorry to       
           bother you           

     but I'm really worried     
        about Danielle.         

           >>Danni ?            

   >>Mr. Myers, she called me   
     a bunch of times today     

   and, and I called her back   
 and left a bunch of messages.  

      I even text messaged      
          her 911 and           

       she hasn't gotten        
          back to me.           

    It's just not like her.     

            >>I see.            

     Do you think she might     
  have contacted anyone else ?  

       >>Oh I don't know!       
         I mean maybe.          

        This total tool         
         Eddie or Nat.          

     They're her only like      
      real friends but ...      

   >>I really appreciate you    
 bringing this to my attention. 

     >>So, she's not here ?     

     >>No, no she went out      
      couple of hours ago       

        with one of her         
      girlfriends but....       

         Now you've got         
          me paranoid.          

    Thank You very much for     
 bringing this to my attention. 

            >>Danni!            

     >>Holy Christ what....     

      What the hell is...       
     what are you doing....     

           >>Go now.            

          That's your           
          stepfather.           

        Do you know how         
      much trouble you're       

          gonna be in?          

     >>If you accept, he's      
       gonna kill us all.       

         >>Are you out          
         of your mind?!         

     >>What are you doing?      

           Danielle!            

             >>Go!              
          >>Danielle!           

   >>He's gonna kill us all!    

       >>Give me the gun,       
           Danielle!            

           Let me go!           
       >>Give me the gun!       

     >>Payback is a bitch.

        [Phone Ringing]         

             Danni!             

   I can't wait to get out of   
    this tired little body.     

          [inaudible]           

   I feel like I've been hit    
      by a fucking truck.       

       [Insects chirping]       

        Oh my God, Jeff!        

        Oh my God! No...

           >>Gwenyth!           
       >>Hello, Charles.        

       >>Pay no attention       
          to my head.           

    I bumped into a kitchen     
         cabinet door,          

    if you can believe that.    

    >>I'm very nervous about    
       this whole thing.        

    How long does it take ?     

      >>It will be done in      
          a heartbeat           

     Um.. did you bring the     
        bank receipts ?         

          >>Of course.          

    5 million now, 5 later.     

   >>Well, let me just take a   
          quick peek.           

        Everything looks        
        well in order..         

But, you know the international 
        time difference,        

 I just need to get hold of the 
     Swiss bank right away,     

   before they close. It will   
      just take a second.       

     Strictly a formality.      

         Yeah, uh I uh          
      Expectancy England.       

           Ja guten!            

         I need account         
         verification.          

        Yes, I'll hold.         

     It's gonna be alright.     

  Please, right up the stairs.  

          [Shrieking]           

            [Crying]            

   Have you been able to make   
  the necessary preparations?   

   The arrangements for your    
    servants and your staff     

    so they'll be, you know,    
       ready to accept a        

      much younger couple       
      running your estate?      

  >>Yes, but I must tell you,   
          I'm a little          

   concerned with inhabiting    
      the body of a woman.      

            [Laughs]            

      >>Well, I have good       
         news for you.          

        That's no longer        
           the case.            

   I have a young male on his   
     way over here for you      

           right now.           

        I was wondering,        

    do you have any friends     

  who might also be interested  
        in the process?         

 >>If the procedure goes well,  
             many!              

    >>Trust me, by the time     
          we are done,          

   you'll be trading in that    
    oxygen tank for a bong.     

       Well, everything's       
      perfectly in order.       

    Let me introduce you to     
       your new packages.       

           [Coughing]           

    >>Who the hell are you ?    

   >>What are you doing here?   
              Go!               

   >>I think we may have the    
         wrong address          

           Pardon us!           
       Let's go my dear!        

      >>No bodies, no ...

      together, it's okay.      

           It's okay.

          have family,          

       what do you have?        

      >>Something I can't       
          do without.           

      >>I'm just glad that
