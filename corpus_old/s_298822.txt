NARRATOR:
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

Although he had
everything his heart desired

the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

But then, one winter's night

an old beggar woman
came to the castle

and offered him a single rose

in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

for beauty is found within

and when he dismissed her again

the old woman's ugliness
melted away

to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

and as punishment,
she transformed him

into a hideous beast

and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

and all who lived there.

Ashamed of his monstrous form

the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

with a magic mirror
as his only window

to the outside world.

The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

which would bloom
until his 21st year.

lf he could learn
to love another

and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

then the spell would be broken.

lf not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

( thunder crashing )

As the years passed,
he fell into despair

and lost all hope

for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

* Little town,
it's a quiet village *

* Every day
like the one before *

* Little town,
full of little people *

* Waking up... to... say... *

Bonjour!

Bonjour!

Bonjour!
Bonjour!

Bonjour!

* There goes the baker *

* With his tray like always *

* The same old bread
and rolls to sell *

* Every morning just the same *

* Since the morning
that we came *

* To this poor
provincial town... *

Good morning, Belle.

Good morning, Monsieur.

Where are you off to?

The bookshop.

l just finished
the most wonderful story

about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

That's nice.

Marie! The baguettes.

Hurry up!

* Look, there she goes *

* The girl is strange,
no question *

* Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell? *

* Never part of any crowd *

* 'Cause her head's
up on some cloud *

* No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle *

* Bonjour *

* Good day *

* How is your family? *

* Bonjour *

* Good day *

* How is your wife? *

* l need six eggs *

* That's too expensive *

* There must be more
than this provincial life... *

-MAN:
Ah, Belle.
( bell jingles )

Good morning.

l've come to return
the book l borrowed.

Finished already?

Oh, l couldn't put it down.

Have you got anything new?

( chuckling )

Not since yesterday.

That's all right.

l'll borrow... this one.

That one?

But you've read it twice.

Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

daring sword fights

magic spells, a
prince in disguise.

lf you like it
all that much, it's yours.

-But, sir...
-l insist.

Well, thank you.

Thank you very much.

* Look, there she goes *

* That girl is so peculiar *

* l wonder
if she's feeling well *

* With a dreamy, far-off look *

* And her nose stuck in a book *

* What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle *

* Oh, isn't this amazing? *

* lt's my favorite part
because you'll see *

* Here's where she meets
Prince Charming *

* But she won't discover
that it's him *

* Till Chapter Three *

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

* Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty *

* Her looks have got
no parallel *

* But behind
that fair facade *

* l'm afraid
she's rather odd *

* Very different
from the rest of us *

GROUP:
* She's nothing like
the rest of us *

* Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle *

( gun fires )

( panting )

Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

You're the greatest hunter

in the whole world.

l know.

No beast alive
stands a chance against you

and no girl,
for that matter.

lt's true, Lefou

and l've got my sights set
on that one.

LEFOU:
The inventor's daughter?

She's the one-- the lucky girl
l'm going to marry.

But, she...

The most beautiful girl in town.

l know, but...

That makes her the best

and don't l
deserve the best?

Well, of course.

l mean, you do, but...

* Right from the moment
when l met her, saw her *

* l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell *

* l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell *

* Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me *

* So, l'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle *

* Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy? *

* Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute *

* Be still, my heart,
l'm hardly breathing *

* He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute *

-* Bonjour * * Pardon *
-* Good day * * Mais oui *

-* You call this bacon? *
-* What lovely grapes *

-* Ten yards * * Some cheese *
-* 'Scuse me * * One pound *

* l'll get the knife *

* Please let me through *

* This bread * * Those fish *

* lt's stale * * They smell *

* Madame's mistaken *

* There must be more *

* Than this provincial life *

* Just watch, l'm going
to make Belle my wife *

* Look, there she goes *

* A girl who's strange
but special *

* A most peculiar mademoiselle *

* lt's a pity and a sin *

* She doesn't quite fit in *

* 'Cause she really is
a funny girl *

* A beauty but a funny girl *

* She really is a funny girl *

* That Belle... *

GASTON:
* Bonjour, bonjour. *

( song ends )

Hello, Belle.

Bonjour, Gaston.

Gaston,
may l have my book, please?

How can you read this?

There's no pictures.

Well, some people
use their imagination.

Belle, it's about time
you got your head

out of those books

and paid attention
to more important things...

like me.

( gasping and sighing )

The whole town's
talking about it.

lt's not right
for a woman to read.

Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

( chuckling ):
Why, thank you, Belle.

What do you say you and me

take a walk over to the tavern

and take a look
at my trophies?

Maybe some other time.

What's wrong with her?

She's crazy.

He's gorgeous.

Please, Gaston, l can't.

l have to get home
to help my father.

Good-bye.

( laughing ):
That crazy old loon--

he needs all the
help he can get.

( laughing )

Don't talk about my father

that way.

Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

My father is not crazy.

He's a genius.

( explosion and whistling )

( both laughing )

Ooh!

( man coughing )

( coughing ):
Papa?

How on earth did that happen?

Doggone it!

Are you all right, Papa?

l'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

You always say that.

l mean it this time.

l'll never get

this boneheaded contraption
to work!

Yes, you will

and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

Humph!

And become
a world-famous inventor.

You really believe that?

l always have.

Well, what are we waiting for?

l'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

Hand me that, uh...

dog-legged clincher, there.

So, did you have a
good time in town today?

l got a new book.

Papa, do you think l'm odd?

My daughter? Odd?

Where would you get
an idea like that?

Oh, l don't know.

lt's just that l'm not sure
l fit in here.

There's no one
l can really talk to.

What about that Gaston?

He's a handsome fellow.

He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

Well, don't you worry

'cause this invention's
going to be the start

of a new life for us.

l think that's done it.

Now, let's give it a try.

( whistle blowing )

( steam hissing )

( gears clanking )

( whirring )

lt works!

lt does?

( glass breaking )
-lt does!

You did it!

You really did it!

Hitch up Philippe, girl.

l'm off to the fair!

( grunting )

Good-bye, Papa.

Good luck.

Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while l'm gone.

( nickers anxiously )

We should be there
by now.

( hooting )

Maybe we've missed
the turn.

l guess l should have taken...

Wait a minute.

( nickering )

Let's go this way.

( nickering )

( distant roaring )

( birds chirping )

Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

We'll be there in no time.

( creatures calling )

( alarmed nickering )

This can't be right.

Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

We'd better turn around.

( distant howling )

Whoa...

Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

Oh...!

Oh, look out!

Oh, look out!

( screeching )

Whoa!

Whoa, boy!

Back up, back up, back up!

Good boy, good boy.

That's it.

Back up!

Steady, steady.

Now, steady.

( wolf howling )

( whinnying )

Philippe, no!

Philippe.

( thunder rumbling )

Oh...

( menacing growls )

( gasping )

( growling )

( wolf howling )

( growling )

( grunting )

( thunder crashing )

( menacing growl )

Help!

ls someone there?!

Help!

( growling )

Oh!

( crying out )

( wolves snarling )

( gasps )

( thunder crashing )

( creaking )

What...?

Oh...

( creaking )

( voice echoing ):
Hello?

Hello?

MALE 1 :
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

MALE 2:
Keep quiet; maybe
he'll go away.

ls someone there?

Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

l don't mean to intrude,
but l've lost my horse

and l need a place to stay

for the night.

Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

Shh!

( sizzling )

( yelping )

Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

Who said that?

Over here.

Where?

Allo.

( gasps )

( grunts )

( groans )

lncredible.

Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

How is this accomplished?

Put me down at once!

Stop that!

( giggling )

Stop that, l say.

( chuckling )

Ow!

( yelling )

Huh... Close that at once.

Do you mind?!

l-l beg your pardon.

lt's, it's just
that l've never seen a...

( snorting )

( sneezing )

( squeaking )

( sniffling )

Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

Come, warm yourself by the fire.

Thank you.

COGSWORTH:
No, no, no.

You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

l demand
that you stop right there.

Oh, no, no!

Not the master's chair.

( barking )

l'm not seeing this!

l am not seeing this!

( chuckling ):
Well, hello there, boy.

( friendly panting )

What service.

All right,
this has gone far enough.

l'm in charge here.

How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

lt'll warm you up
in no time.

No. No tea.

No tea!

( giggling )

His mustache tickles, Mama.

Oh!

( chuckling )

Hello.

( ominous rumbling )

( clattering )

Uh-oh.

Oh...

( growling deeply )

Ah...

There's a stranger here.

Master, allow me to explain.

The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

He was cold and wet...

( roaring thunderously )

Master, l'd like
to take this moment to say

l was against this
from the start.

lt was all his fault.

l tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

( roaring
thunderously )

( gasping )

Who are you?

What are you doing here?

l-l-l was lost in the woods,
and, and...

You're not welcome here!

l-l-l'm sorry.

What are you staring at?!

N-Nothing.

So, you've come to stare

at the Beast, have you?!

Please, l meant no harm!

l just needed
a place to stay.

l'll give you
a place to stay.

Oh, no...!

Please! Oh, no!

( door slams
with an echoing thud )

Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

huh, Gaston?

Yep. This is her lucky day.

( thudding )

( Gaston clears throat )

l'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

But first l'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

( laughing )

( sobbing )

And you, Lefou--
now, when

Belle and l come
out that door...

Oh, l know, l know!

l-l strike up the band.

( playing ''Here Comes the Bride''
at fast tempo )

Not yet!

Sorry.

( knocking )

( groans )

Gaston.

What a pleasant surprise.

lsn't it, though?

l'm just full of surprises.

You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

This is the day...

Hmm.

Yeah.

This is the day your
dreams come true.

This is the day your
dreams come true.

What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

Plenty. Here, picture this:

A rustic hunting lodge

my latest kill
roasting on the fire

and my little wife,
massaging my feet

while the little ones

play on the floor
with the dogs.

We'll have six or seven.

Dogs?

No, Belle!

Strapping boys,
like me.

lmagine that.

And do you know

who that little
wife will be?

Let me think.

You, Belle.

Gaston, l'm...

l'm...

speechless.

l really don't
know what to say.

Say you'll marry me.

l'm very sorry,
Gaston, but...

but...

l just don't deserve you.

-Whoa!
-( water splashes )

( playing
''Here Comes the Bride'' )

( pig oinks )

( squeals )

So, how'd it go?

( grunts )

l'll have Belle for my wife.

Make no mistake about that!

Touchy.

( snorting )

ls he gone?

( chickens clucking )

Can you imagine?

He asked me to marry him.

Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

* Madame Gaston *

* Can't you just see it? *

* Madame Gaston *

* His little wife *

( clucking, bleating )

* No, sir, not me *

* l guarantee it *

* l want much more
than this provincial life *

* l want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere *

* l want it more
than l can tell *

* And for once
it might be grand *

* To have someone understand *

* l want so much more
than they've got planned. *

( horse neighs )

Philippe!
What are you doing here?

Where's...?

Where's Papa?

Where is he, Philippe?

What happened?

Oh, we have to find him.

You have to take me to him.

( ominous music playing )

What is this place?

( snorting )

( neighing )

Philippe, please!

Steady!

( neighing continues )

Steady.

( gasps )

Papa.

Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

Serve him tea.

Sit in the master's chair.

Pet the pooch.

l was trying
to be hospitable.

( door creaking )

( echoing ):
Hello?

ls anyone here?

Hello? Papa?

Papa?

Are you here?

Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

Now, Chip, l'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

Really, Mama.
l saw her.

Not another word.

But...

lnto the tub.

Woop...

Well! l saw a girl
in the castle!

See? l told you.

lrresponsible,
devil-may-care

waxy-eared,
slack-jawed...

BELLE:
Papa?

Did you see that?

( gasps )

lt's a girl!

l know it's a girl.

Don't you see?

She's the one--

the girl we have
been waiting for.

She has come
to break the spell!

Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

Papa?

( door creaks )

Papa?

Hello?

ls someone here?

Wait!

l'm looking for
my father. l...

That's funny.

l'm sure there was someone.

l-ls anyone here?

MAURlCE:
Belle?

Papa!

H-How did you find me?

Oh, your hands
are like ice.

( coughing )

l have to get
you out of there.

Belle, l want you
to leave this place.

Who's done this to you?

No time to explain.

You must go! Now!

l won't leave you!

What are you doing here?

Run, Belle!

Who's there?
Who are you?

The master of this castle.

( snarling )

l've come for my father.

Please let him out.

Can't you see he's sick?

Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

But he could die.

Please, l-l'll do anything.

There's nothing you can do.

He's my prisoner.

Oh, there must be
some way l can...

Wait!

Take me instead.

You?!

You would...

take his place?

Belle, no!

You don't know
what you're doing!

lf l did,
would you let him go?

Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

Come into the light.

( gasps )

No, Belle!

l won't let you do this!

You have my word.

Done!

( door unlocking )

No, Belle,
listen to me.

l'm old.
l've lived my life.

Wait.

Belle!

Wait!

No, please spare my daughter.

Please!

She's no longer
your concern.

( grunts )

Take him
to the village.

Let me out!

Please let me out!

Let me out!

Please! Oh, please!

( sobbing )

Master?

What?

Since the girl is going
to be with us

for quite some time

l was thinking that you
might want to offer her

a more comfortable room.

( fierce growling )

Then again, maybe not.

( sobbing )

You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

l'll never see him
again.

l didn't get
to say good-bye.

l'll show you to your room.

My room?

But l thought...

You want to stay in the tower?

No.

Then follow me.

( gasping )

Say something to her.

Huh? Oh.

l, uh, hope you like it here.

The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

except the west wing.

What's in the west...?

lt's forbidden!

Now, if you need anything

my servants will attend you.

Dinner.
lnvite her to dinner.

You will join me
for dinner.

That's not a request!

( door slams )

( gasping )

( sobbing )

( wind whistling )

GASTON:
Who does she think she is?

That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

No one says no
to Gaston.

Darn right.

Dismissed, rejected...

publicly humiliated.

Why, it's more
than l can bear.

More beer?

What for?

Nothing helps.

l'm disgraced.

Who, you?

Never!

Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

* Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston *

* Looking so down
in the dumps *

* Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston *

* Even when taking
your lumps *

* There's no man in town
as admired as you *

* You're everyone's
favorite guy *

* Everyone's awed and
inspired by you *

* And it's not very hard
to see why *

( women cooing )

* No... one's... *

* Slick as Gaston *

* No one's quick
as Gaston *

* No one's neck's as incredibly
thick as Gaston *

* For there's no man in town
half as manly *

* Perfect, a pure paragon *

* You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley *

* And they'll tell you
whose team *

* They prefer to be on *

Ooh!

* No... one's...
been like Gaston *

* A kingpin like Gaston *

* No one's got a full cleft *

* ln his chin
like Gaston *

* As a specimen, yes,
l'm intimidating *

* My, what a guy, that Gaston *

* Give five ''hurrahs!'' *

* Give 12 ''hip-hips!'' *

* Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips *

* No... one... *

* Fights like Gaston *

* Douses lights like Gaston *

* ln a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston *

* For there's no one
as burly and brawny *

* As you see,
l've got biceps to spare *

* Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny *

* That's right *

* And every last inch of me's
covered with hair *

* No one hits like Gaston *

* Matches wits like Gaston *

* ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston *

* l'm especially good
at expectorating *

* Ptooey! *

* Ten points for Gaston! *

* When l was a lad *

* l ate four dozen eggs *

* Every morning
to help me get large *

* And now
that l'm grown *

* l eat
five dozen eggs *

* So l'm roughly
the size of a barge *

* No... one... *

* Shoots like Gaston *

* Makes those beauts
like Gaston *

* Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston *

* l use antlers
in all of my decorating *

* My, what a guy *

* Gaston! *

( screaming )

( cheering )

Help!

Help!

Someone help me!

Maurice?

Please, please!

l need your help.

He's got her...

He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

Who?

Belle. We must go.

N-Not a minute to lose.

Whoa!

Slow down, Maurice.

Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

A beast!

A horrible, monstrous
beast.

( laughter )

ls it a big beast?

Huge!

With a long ugly snout?

Hideously ugly.

And sharp,
cruel fangs?

Yes, yes.

Will you help me?

All right,
old man.

We'll help you out.

You will?

Oh, thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you!

( grunting ):
Oh!

( grunting ):
Oh!

Crazy old Maurice.

He's always good
for a laugh.

Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

* Lefou, l'm afraid
l've been thinking *

* A dangerous pastime... *

* l know *

* But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father *

* And his sanity's
only so-so *

* Now the wheels
in my head *

* Have been turning *

* Since l looked at
that loony old man *

* See, l promised myself *

* l'd be married to Belle *

* And right now,
l'm evolving a plan *

lf l...

( whispering )

LEFOU:
Yes?

Then we... ( whispering )

No! Would she...?

Guess!

Now l get it!

BOTH:
Let's go!

* No... one... *

* Plots like Gaston *

* Takes cheap shots
like Gaston *

* Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston *

TOWNSFOLK:
* So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating *

* My, what a guy! *

* Gaston! *

Will no one help me?

( wind whistling )

( sobbing )

( knock on door )

Who is it?

Mrs. Potts, dear.

l thought you might
like a spot of tea.

But you're... you're a...

Ooh!

Careful.

This is impossible.

l know it is.

But here we are.

l told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

Slowly now.

Don't spill.

Thank you.

Want to see me
do a trick?

( inhales )

MRS. POTTS:
Chip!

Oops. Sorry.

That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

We all think so.

But l've lost my father

my dreams... everything.

Cheer up, child.

lt'll turn out

all right
in the end.

You'll see.

Oh, listen to me.

Jabbering on while
there's a supper

to get on the table.

Chip!

Bye.

Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

Oh, let's see what l got
in my drawers.

Ooh! How embarrassing.

( nervous laughter )

( clears throat )

Ah, here we are.

You'll look ravishing

in this one.

That's very kind
of you, but...

l'm not going
to dinner.

Oh, but you must.

( sputtering )

Dinner is served.

( snarling )

What's taking so long?

l told her to come down.

Why isn't she here yet?

Oh, try to be
patient, sir.

The girl has
lost her father

and her freedom,
all in one day.

Master, have you thought

that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

Of course l have.

l'm not a fool.

Good!

So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

and poof!
The spell is broken.

We'll be human again
by midnight.

Ooh, it's not
that easy, Lumiere.

These things take time.

But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

Oh, it's no use.

She's so beautiful, and l'm...

Well, look at me!

Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

l don't know how.

Well, you can start

by making yourself
more presentable.

Straighten up.

Try to act like
a gentleman.

Ah, yes.
When she comes in

give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

Come, come,
show me the smile.

But don't frighten
the poor girl.

lmpress her
with your rapier wit.

But be gentle.

Shower her
with compliments.

But be sincere.

And above all...

BOTH:
You must control your temper!

( doorknob rattling )

Here she is!

Good evening.

Well, where is she?

Who? Oh.

( giggles )

The girl, yes.

The... girl.

Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

Circumstances being
what they are...

She's not coming.

What?!

But, your grace...!

Your eminence!

( yelling )

l thought l told you
to come down to dinner!

BELLE:
l'm not hungry.

You come out, or l'll...

l'll... l'll break down
the door!

Master...

l could be wrong,
but that may not be

the best way
to win the girl's affections.

Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

But she is being so difficult.

Gently, gently.

Will you come down to dinner?

No.

Hmm?

Ah, ah, ah!

Suave, genteel.

lt would give me
great pleasure

if you would join
me for dinner.

( clearing throat )

( mumbling ):
We say please.

Please.

No, thank you!

You can't stay in there forever!

Yes, l can.

Fine. Then go ahead
and starve!

lf she doesn't eat with me

then she doesn't eat at all.

( roaring )

( door slams )

Oh, dear.

That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

and inform me at once

if there is
the slightest change.

You can count on me,
mon capitan.

Well, we might as well
go downstairs

and start cleaning up.

l ask nicely,
but she refuses.

Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

Show me the girl.

Well, the master's
really not so bad

once you get
to know him.

Why don't you
give him a chance?

l don't want to
get to know him.

l don't want to
have anything

to do with him!

( groans )

l'm just fooling myself.

She'll never see me
as anything...

but a monster.

lt's hopeless.

GlRL:
Oh, no!

LUMlERE:
Oh, yes!

Oh, no!

Oh, yes, yes, yes!

l've been burned
by you before.

( chuckling )

( gasps )

Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

Come on, Chip,
into the cupboard

with your brothers
and sisters.

( yawning )

But l'm not sleepy.

Yes, you are.

No, l'm not.

l work and l slave all
day long and for what?

A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

Oh, stop your grousing.

lt's been a long night
for all of us.

Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

After all,
he did say please.

But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

he'll never break...

Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

l am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

This is Lumiere.

Enchante, cherie.

lf there's...
Stop that!

...anything we...
Please!

can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

Ow!

l am a little hungry.

You are?

Hear that?
She's hungry.

Stoke the fire.

Break out
the silver.

Wake the china.

Remember what the master said.

Oh, pishposh.

l'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

All right, fine.

Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

Cogsworth, l am
surprised at you.

She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

We must make her
feel welcome here.

Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

Well, keep it down.

lf the master finds out
about this

it will be
our necks.

Of course, of course.

But what is dinner
without a little music?

Music?

Ma chere
mademoiselle.

lt is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

that we welcome you tonight.

And now

we invite you
to relax.

Let us
pull up a chair

as the dining room
proudly presents...

your dinner.

* Be... our... guest *

* Be our guest *

* Put our service
to the test *

* Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie *

* And we provide the rest *

* Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres *

* Why, we only live
to serve *

* Try the gray stuff *

* lt's delicious *

* Don't believe me,
ask the dishes *

* They can sing,
they can dance *

* After all, Miss,
this is France *

* And a dinner here
is never second best *

* Go on, unfold your menu *

* Take a glance and then *

* You'll be our guest *

* Oui, our guest *

* Be our guest *

* Beef ragout,
cheese souffle *

* Pie and pudding
en flambe *

* We'll prepare and serve
with flair *

* A culinary cabaret *

* You're alone
and you're scared *

* But the banquet's
all prepared *

* No one's gloomy
or complaining *

* While the flatware's
entertaining *

* We tell jokes,
l do tricks *

* With my fellow candlesticks *

* And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet *

* Come on and lift your glass *

* You've won your own
free pass *

* To be our guest-- *

* lf you're stressed *

* lt's fine dining
we suggest-- *

* Be our guest,
be our guest *

* Be our guest! *

( mournfully ):
* Life is so unnerving *

* For a servant
who's not serving *

* He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon *

Get off!

-( sleigh bells jingling )
-* Ah, those good old days
when we were useful *

Huh?

* Suddenly, those good
old days are gone *

( groans ):
Oh!

* Ten years
we've been rusting *

* Needing so much more
than dusting *

* Needing exercise *

* A chance
to use our skills *

( howling )

* Most days we just
lay around the castle *

( grunting )

* Flabby, fat and lazy *

* You walked in
and oops-a-daisy! *

* lt's a guest, it's a guest! *

* Sakes alive,
well, l'll be blessed *

* Wine's been poured, *
And thank the lord *

* l've had the napkins
freshly pressed *

* With dessert,
she'll want tea *

* And, my dear,
that's fine with me *

* While the cups
do their soft-shoeing *

* l'll be bubbling,
l'll be brewing *

* l'll get warm,
piping hot *

* Heaven's sake,
is that a spot? *

* Clean it up, we want
the company impressed *

* We've got a lot to do *

* ls it one lump or two? *

* For you, our guest *

* She's our guest *

* She's our guest *

* She's our guest *

People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

( screams )

* lt's ten years since
we've had anybody here *

* And we're obsessed *

* With your meal,
with your ease *

* Yes, indeed,
we aim to please *

* While the candlelight's
still glowing *

* Let us help you,
we'll keep going *

* Course... by... course *

* One by one *

* Till you shout,
''Enough, l'm done!'' *

* Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest *

* Tonight you'll prop
your feet up *

* But for now, let's eat up *

* Be our guest,
be our guest *

* Be our guest *

* Please be our guest! *

Bravo!

That was wonderful.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mademoiselle.

Good show, wasn't it?

Yes, everyone.

My goodness, look at the time.

Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

Oh, l couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

lt's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

Enchanted!

( laughing )

Who said anything

about the castle
being enchanted?

lt was you, wasn't it?

l figured it out for myself.

( grunting and groaning )

l'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

Oh, would you
like a tour?

Wait a second,
wait a second.

l'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

We can't let her
go poking around

in certain places, if
you know what l mean.

Perhaps you'd like
to take me.

l'm sure you know
everything

there is to know
about the castle.

Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

Yes, l do.

As you can see

the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

This is yet another example

of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

and, as l always say

if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

( chuckling )

Uh, where was l?

As you were.

Now, then, if l may
draw your attention

to the flying buttresses
above the...

Uh, Mademoiselle?

( barking )

What's up there?

Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

in the west wing.

Dusty, dull, very boring.

Ah, so that's the west wing.

Nice going.

l wonder what
he's hiding up there?

Hiding?

The master is
hiding nothing.

Then it wouldn't
be forbidden.

Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

uh-uh, uh...
see something else.

We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

maybe later.

Th-The gardens or-or

the-the-the-the
library, perhaps.

You have a library?

( laughs ):
Yes, oh, indeed.

With books.

Scads of books!

Mountains of books!

Forests of books!

-Cascades!
-Longboats!

Swamps of books!

COGSWORTH:
More books than you'll

ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

who ever set pen
to paper.

* *

( grunts )

( creaking )

* *

Oh!

( gasps )

* *

( gasps )

( growls )

( gasps )

( snarling )

Why did you come here?

l'm... l'm sorry.

l warned you never
to come here.

l didn't mean any harm.

Do you realize
what you could have done?!

Please, stop.

Get out!

( gasping ):
No!

( echoing ):
Get... out!

Where are you going?

Promise or no promise

l can't stay here
another minute.

Oh, no, wait,
please.

Please wait.

( neighing )

( gasping )

( snarling )

( terrified neighing )

Oh!

( screams )

( neighing )

( barking and snarling )

( growling )

Oh!

( screams )

( growling )

( barking )

( fierce growling )

( whimpering )

( grunts )

( nickering )

( wind whistling )

Here now.

Oh, don't do that.

( growling )

Just hold still.

( roaring )

That hurts!

lf you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

Well, if you hadn't
have run away

this wouldn't
have happened!

lf you hadn't frightened me,
l wouldn't have run away!

Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

Now hold still.

This might sting a little.

Hmm?

( groaning )

By the way, thank you.

For saving my life.

You're welcome.

l don't usually
leave the asylum

in the middle
of the night

but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

( coins clinking )

Ah.

l'm listening.

lt's like this.

l've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

but she needs a little...
persuasion.

( snickering )

Turned him down flat.

Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

He was in here tonight

raving about a beast
in a castle.

Maurice is harmless.

The point is,
Belle would do anything

to keep him
from being locked up.

( laughs )

Yeah. Even marry him.

So you want me

to throw her father
into the asylum

unless she agrees
to marry you.

Oh, that is despicable.

( laughs )

l love it!

MAURlCE:
lf no one will help me

then l'll go back alone.

Yes, is that everything?

l don't care
what it takes.

l'll find that castle,
and somehow

l'll get her out of there.

( wind howling )

( pounding )

Belle? Maurice?

Oh, well.

( laughs )

l guess it's not going
to work after all.

They have to come
back sometime.

And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

Lefou...

don't move
from that spot

until Belle and
her father come home.

But, but, l...

( grunting )

Aw, nuts.

( barking )

( laughing )

l've never felt this way
about anyone.

l want to do something for her.

But what?

Well, there's the usual things.

Flowers, chocolates.

Promises you don't intend
to keep.

Ah, no, no.

lt has to be something
very special.

Something that sparks
her interest.

Wait a minute!

Belle, there's something
l want to show you.

But first, you have
to close your eyes.

lt's a surprise.

( door creaks )

Can l open them?

No, no. Not yet.

Wait here.

Now can l open them?

All right.

Now.

( gasps )

l can't believe it!

l've never seen
so many books in all my life!

You-You like it?

lt's wonderful!

Then it's yours.

Oh, thank you
so much.

Oh, would you
look at that!

l knew it would work.

What?
What worked?

lt's very
encouraging.

lsn't this exciting?

l didn't see anything.

Come along, Chip.

There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

But what are
they talking about?

What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

( gasps )

( slurping )

( slurping )

( giggling )

BELLE:
* There's something sweet *

* And almost kind *

* But he was mean *

* And he was coarse
and unrefined *

* And now he's dear,
and so unsure *

* l wonder why l didn't see it
there before *

( birds chirping )

BEAST:
* She glanced this way *

* l thought l saw *

* And when we touched *

* She didn't shudder
at my paw *

* No, it can't be *

* l'll just ignore *

* But then she's never looked
at me that way before *

BELLE:
* New and a bit alarming *

* Who'd have ever thought
that this could be? *

* True that he's no
Prince Charming *

* But there's something
in him *

* That l simply didn't see... *

* Well, who'd
have thought? *

* Well, bless my soul *

* Well, who'd
have known? *

* Well, who indeed? *

* And who'd
have guessed *

* They'd come together
on their own? *

* lt's so peculiar *

* We'll wait and see *

* A few days more *

* There may be something there
that wasn't there before... *

You know,
perhaps there is

* Something there
that wasn't there before *

What?

* There may be something there
that wasn't there before. *

What's there, Mama?

Shh!

l'll tell you
when you're older.

( kisses )

Right, then!

You all know why we're here.

We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

to create the most magical

spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

( laughs )

''Or beast...''

( cricket chirping quietly )

Right.

Need l remind you

that if the last petal falls
from this rose

the spell will never be...

broken!

Very well.

You all know your assignments.

Half of you to the west wing.

Half of you to the east wing.

The rest of you, come with me.

( barking )

( yells )

Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth

and let nature take its course.

lt's obvious there's
a spark between them.

Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

You know... a little.

Besides, they must fall in love

tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

Ah, human again.

Human again.

Yes, think
what that means.

( bells tolling )

* l'll be cooking again *

* Be good looking again *

* With a mademoiselle
on each arm *

* When l'm human again *

* Only human again *

* Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm *

* l'll be courting again *

* Chic and sporting again *

* Which should cause
several husbands alarm *

* Ha, ha!
l'll hop down off this shelf *

* And tout de suite be myself *

* l can't wait
to be human again *

* When we're human again *

* Only human again *

* When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more *

* When we're human again,
good and human again *

* Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer? *

* l'll wear lipstick and rouge *

* And l won't be so huge *

* Why, l'll easily fit
through that door *

* l'll exude savoir faire *

* l'll wear gowns,
l'll have hair *

* lt's my prayer
to be human again *

( crashing )

* When we're human again *

* Only human again *

* When the world once more
starts making sense *

* l'll unwind, for a change *

* Really? That'd be strange *

* Can l help it
if l'm t-t-tense? *

* ln a shack by the sea *

* l'll sit back, sipping tea *

* Let my early
retirement commence *

* Far from fools made of wax *

* l'll get down to brass tacks
and relax! *

* When l'm human again *

* So sweep the dust
from the floor *

* Let's let some light
in the room *

* l can feel, l can tell *

* Someone might break the spell
any day now *

( barking )

* Shine up the brass
on the door *

* Alert the dust pail
and broom *

* lf it all goes as planned *

* Our time may be at hand
any day now *

* Open the shutters,
and let in some air *

* Put these here,
and put those over there *

* Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears *

* And throw them away *

( clears throat )

* We'll be human again *

* Only human again *

* When the girl
finally sets us all free *

* Cheeks a-blooming again *

* We're assuming again *

* We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre *

* We'll be playing again *

* Holidaying again *

* And we're praying
it's ASAP *

( cat snarls )

* We will push, we will shove *

* They will both fall in love *

* And we'll finally
be human again... *

For never was a story
of more woe

Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

( sighs )

Could you read it again?

Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

Uh, all right.

Uh...

Uh... l can't.

You mean,
you never learned?

l learned... a little.

lt's just been so long.

Well, here, l'll help you.

Let's start here.

Here.

Okay, ''Twoe...''

''Two.''

''Two... l knew that.

Two households...''

* We'll be dancing again *

* We'll be twirling again *

* We'll be whirling around
with such ease *

* When we're human again *

* Only human again *

* We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes *

* We'll be floating again *

* We'll be gliding again *

* Stepping, striding
as fine as you please *

* Like a real human does *

* l'll be all that l was *

* On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn *

* And we're all *

* Human again! *

( sighing )

( growls )

Tonight is
the night.

l'm not sure l can do this.

You don't have time to be timid.

You must be bold, daring.

Bold, daring.

There will be music...

romantic candlelight...

provided by myself.

And when the moment
is right

you confess your love.

Yes, l con...

l-l... No, l can't.

You care for the girl,
don't you?

More than anything.

Well, then,
you must tell her.

Voila!

Oh, you look so... so...

Stupid.

Not quite the word
l was looking for.

Perhaps a little more
off the top?

( clearing throat )

Your lady awaits.

( chuckles )

( clears throat )

* Tale as old as time *

* True as it can be *

( barking )

* Barely even friends *

* Then somebody bends *

* Unexpectedly *

* Just a little change *

* Small, to say the least *

* Both a little scared *

* Neither one prepared *

* Beauty and the Beast *

( gulps )

* Ever just the same *

* Ever a surprise *

Huh? Huh? Huh?

* Ever as before *

* Ever just as sure *

* As the sun will rise *

* Tale as old as time *

* Tune as old as song *

* Bittersweet and strange *

* Finding you can change *

* Learning you were wrong *

* Certain as the sun *

* Rising in the east *

* Tale as old as time *

* Song as old as rhyme *

* Beauty and the Beast *

Shh!

* Tale as old as time *

* Song as old as rhyme *

* Beauty and the Beast. *

Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

lt's past your bedtime.

( yawns )

Good night, love.

( insects humming )

Belle?

Are you... happy
here with me?

Yes.

What is it?

lf only l could see
my father again

just for a moment.

l miss him so much.

There is a way.

This mirror will show
you anything...

anything
you wish to see.

l'd like to see
my father, please.

( coughs )

Papa?

Oh, no.

He's sick.

He may be dying

and he's all alone.

Then, you must go to him.

What did you say?

l release you.

You are no longer my prisoner.

You mean...

l'm free?

Yes.

Oh, thank you.

Hold on, Papa.

l'm on my way.

Take it with you

so you'll always have
a way to look back

and remember me.

Thank you for
understanding

how much he needs me.

Well, Your Highness,
l must say

everything is going
just swimmingly.

l knew you had it in you.

( laughs )

l let her go.

( chuckles )

Yes, yes.

Splen...

You what?

How could you do that?

l had to.

Yes, but...

( sputtering )

Why?

Because... l love her.

ALL:
He did what?

Yes.

l'm afraid it's true.

She's going away?

But he was so close.

After all this time

he's finally learned to love.

That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

But it's not enough.

She has to love him
in return.

COGSWORTH:
Now it's too late.

( roaring )

Papa! Papa!

( gasping )

Ooh.

They're back.

Belle?

Shh.

lt's all right, Papa.

l'm home.

l thought l'd never

see you again.

l missed you so much.

but the Beast?

Did you...
How did you escape?

l didn't escape, Papa.

He let me go.

That horrible beast?

But he's different now, Papa.

He's changed somehow.

Hi.

Oh. A stowaway.

Why, hello there, little fella.

Didn't think
l'd see you again.

Belle, why'd you go away?

Don't you like us anymore?

Oh, Chip, of course l do.

lt's just...

( knocking )

May l help you?

l've come to collect
your father.

My father?

Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

We'll take good care of him.

My father's not crazy.

He was raving like a lunatic.

We all heard him, didn't we?

( all agreeing )

No, l won't let you.

Belle?

Maurice, tell us again, old man.

Just how big
was the beast?

( chuckles )

He was... l mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

l-l'd say
at least eight...

No, more like ten feet.

( laughing )

Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

( all laughing )

lt's true, l tell you.

Get him
out of here.

Let go of me.

No!

You can't do this.

Poor Belle.

lt's a shame
about your father.

You know he's
not crazy, Gaston.

Hmm, l might be able
to clear up this...

little misunderstanding.

lf...

lf what?

lf you marry me.

What?

One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

Never.

Have it your way.

Belle.

Let go of me.

My father's not crazy

and l can prove it.

Show me the Beast.

( roaring )

( crowd gasping )

WOMAN:
ls it dangerous?

Oh, no, no, he'd
never hurt anyone.

Please, l know he looks vicious

but he's really
kind and gentle.

He's my friend.

lf l didn't know better

l'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

She's as crazy
as the old man.

The Beast will make off
with your children.

-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

We're not safe

till his head
is mounted on my wall.

l say we kill the Beast!

( cheering )

* We're not safe
until he's dead *

* He'll come stalking us
at night *

* Set to sacrifice
our children *

* To his monstrous appetite *

* He'll wreak havoc
on our village *

* lf we let him wander free *

* So it's time to take
some action, boys *

* lt's time to follow me *

( cheering )

* Through the mist,
through the woods *

* Through the darkness
and the shadows *

* lt's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride *

* Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle *

* And there's something
truly terrible inside *

* lt's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones *

* Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast *

* Hear him roar, see him foam *

* But we're not coming home *

* Till he's dead *

* Good and dead *

* Kill the Beast! *

No, l won't
let you do this.

lf you're not with us,
you're against us.

Bring the old man.

Get your hands off me.

We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

Let us out!

We'll rid the village
of this beast.

Who's with me?

( cheering )

* Raise your torch,
mount your horse *

* Screw your courage
to the sticking place *

* We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way *

* Through the mist,
through the wood *

* Where,
within a haunted castle *

* Something's lurking
that you don't see every day *

* lt's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain *

* We won't rest
till he's good and deceased *

* Sally forth, tally ho *

* Grab your sword,
grab your bow *

* Praise the lord,
and here we go. *

We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

l have to warn the Beast.

This is all my fault.

Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

Now, now.

We'll think of something.

Ah!

( thunder claps )

* We don't like
what we don't understand *

* ln fact, it scares us *

* And this monster
is mysterious at least *

* Bring your guns,
bring your knives *

* Save your children
and your wives *

* We'll save our village
and our lives *

* We'll kill the Beast! *

COGSWORTH:
l knew it.

l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

( barking )

Could it be?

ls it she?

Sacre bleu!

lnvaders.

COGSWORTH:
Encroachers.

POTTS:
And they have
the mirror.

Warn the master.

lf it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

Who's with me?

Ah!

Take whatever booty
you can find

but remember,
the Beast is mine!

* Lights ablaze, banners high *

* We go marching into battle *

* Unafraid, although
the danger just increased *

* Raise the flag,
sing the song *

* Here we come,
we're 50 strong *

* And 50 Frenchmen
can't be wrong *

* Let's kill the Beast! *

-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

( shouting )

Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

This isn't working.

Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

Wait, l know.

( shouting )

What shall
we do, Master?

lt doesn't matter now.

Just let them come.

Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

Kill the Beast!

( complete silence )

( blowing )

Yes!

( whistle blowing )

Here we go.

( whistle tooting )

Belle, look out!

You guys got to try this thing.

( screaming )

Up here

( cheering )

And stay out!

Eww!

( groans )

( roaring )

( laughing maniacally )

Get up.

( moaning )

Get up!

What's the matter, Beast?

( laughing )

Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

( groans )

BELLE:
No!

( horse whinnies )

Belle...

No! Gaston, don't!

( growling )

( snarling )

Let's go, Philippe.

( whinnying )

( groans )

( growling )

Come on out and fight!

Were you in love with her,
Beast?

Did you honestly think
she'd want you

when she had someone like me?

( growling )

lt's over, Beast.

Belle is mine!

Let me go. Let me go.

Please, don't hurt me.

l'll do anything.

Anything!

( Gaston moaning )

Get out.

Beast!

Belle?

Belle?

You came back.

( thud )

( roaring )

( screaming )

( scream stops )

( panting )

You...

You came back.

Of course l came back.

l couldn't let them...

Oh, this is all my fault.

lf only l'd gotten
here sooner.

Maybe... it's better...

it's better this way.

Don't talk like that.

You'll be all right.

( coughing )

We're together now.

Everything's
going to be fine.

You'll see.

And... at least...

l got to see you...

one last time.

( exhales )

No. No.

Please... Please...

Please, don't leave me.

( sobbing )

l love you.

( sobbing )

Lumiere.

Cogsworth!

Mrs. Potts!

Look at us.

Mama, Mama.

( barking )

( chuckling )

My goodness.

lt is a miracle.

( Belle laughing )

( sighs )

L'amour.

( lusty laugh )

Well, Lumiere,
old friend.

Shall we let bygones
be bygones?

Of course, mon ami.

l told you she would
break the spell.

l beg your pardon,
old friend

but l believe
l told you.

No, you didn't--
l told you.

You most certainly
did not, you pompous

paraffin-headed
peabrain.

En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

Take that.

( quarreling continues )

Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

Of course, my dear.

Of course.

Do l still have
to sleep in the cupboard?
