 <i> I think Jack's piece of cake</i>  

      is just way too big.      

          Mom: I think          
      you might be right.       

            Ah, uh!             

  Are you ready for bed, Jack?  

       Mommy tucks me in.       

       Tonight is one of        
    the nights that daddy       

    tucks you in, okay Jack?    

              No.               

     Boy you are stubborn.      

  That is daddy's worst trait.  

        Dad: I do recall        
        that's how I got        

 my prom date with you though.  

         Hmm, let's go.         

      I'll be right down.       

      Hey come here, come       
       here, look at me.        

  Remember, your worst quality  

     can also be your best.     

             Okay?              

         Give me a hug.         

   And he's in for the score!   

      Good night sweetie.       

          I love you.           

           (rumbling)           

          (gun fires)           

             Mike:              
     <i> Don't, please. Help!</i>      

          -(gun fires)

         (wolf howling)         

        Brandon: She is         
    thirsting for my penis.     

         She's hungry.          

      man: She is so bad.       

    She can't see out of the    
   back of her head, Nimrod.    

     Yeah, but I'm saying--     

        Yeah, and I'm a         
    sexual being, big woop.     

         I'm out there.         

 I've put myself in the field.  

        I'm a predator.         

      I'm like, (hisses).       

          Another one.          

         (party music)          

            (puking)            

         (upbeat music)         

         Ah, looks like         
       I'm just in time.        

       Gives me an idea.        

        (humming)               

             So...              

        Happy birthday.         

     Happy birthday, Jack.      

         Jack: Thanks.          

           -Hey, man.           
             -Hey.              

        -How you doing?         
             -Good.             

      Why are you sitting       
      here? You feel okay?      

             Yeah.              

     All right, well, I got     
    my eye on a few ladies.     

       You wanna go, you        
     wanna go talk to them?     

    And do a little hunting,    
    a little pussy hunting?     

        -Jack: I'm okay.        
             -Yeah!             

          Go on ahead.          

       I have a favor to        
      ask from you though.      

       Can you watch the        
       door while I go to       

     the bathroom, I really     
   have to use the bathroom.    

           You don't            
       wanna go in there.       

         You know, ah,          
     goddamn, that stings!      

       Does uh, does your       
    bro wanna play flip cup?    

      He's not-- he's not       
      my brother actually,      

        he's my cousin.         

  I don't care, I don't care.   

     You keep saying stuff.     
         I don't care.          

       Do you wanna play?       

      I'm good, thank you.      

      I'll play. Do I need      
       any dice for this?       

     What's happening here,     
   I like it, it's very good,   

  very passionate, very sexy.   

     If we could just get a     
    little of this left hand    

       down on the titty.       
    Just touch them titties.    

     Just one bit, come on.     
    What-- Hi, how are you?     

  Turner, what are you doing?   

        Hi, I'm Turner,         
       nice to meet you.        

              Hi.               

        Hi, hello, these        
     are very lovely boots.     

   Do you mind if I sit right   
    here in the middle here,    

         a little fast?         

    All right, ahh, so, uhm,    

   I'm here now, so why don't   
   you guys just catch me up,   

      where were you two.       
     It looks like you were     

  somewhere around right here.  

           (laughing)           

       I don't think so.        

              Oh!               

     Brunette girl: No, no!     

        All right, well.        

        Smell ya later.         

     Yo, who's that fucking     
     freshman who has never     
      smoked weed before?       

Brandon: Oh, I've never smoked. 

    -Frat boy 1: That's you?    
             -Yeah.             

          Frat boy 1:           
    Take a hit right now!       

         I'll take it.          
     Oh, he should take it.     

       Frat boy in purple       
       shirt: Take a hit,       

      it's your birthday!       

        -No, no, no, no.        
-Frat boy 1: Oh, go for it!     

 Dude I don't have all day man. 

        All right, let's        
        go, I'll do it!         

You know, this is how you do it.
    Look, look, look, look!     

      You light it and you      
   just go, (smacking lips).    

         Brandon: Could         
      you light it for me?      

   Frat boy in purple shirt:    
You can light it for him right? 

   Yeah you go it, all right!   

  Group: (chanting) Freshman,   
    freshman, freshman...       

           (coughing)           

           (cheering)           

           Let's go!!           

        -What the fuck?         
        -What the fuck?         

          -I am so...           
      -You can't do that!       

     That wasn't me, there      
  was some flash of just red.   

      man: That's insane!       

 Get the fuck out of my house!  

 Get the fuck out of my house!  

          (footsteps)           

     Turner: I swear there      
    is no way that your dick    

     is sorer than mine is.     

    Brandon: No I'm telling     
   you, I really went to town   

     on myself last night.      

   Turner: Oh yeah, you did.    

     Whereas Little Turner,     
      he was taken care of      

    by an experienced third     
 party participant last night.  

 What, no way, you f-ed a girl? 

      Turner: Oh, better.       

  You told her you loved her?   

         What, no, man,         

     I got my dick sucked.      

        Nice, you got it        
      on the forehead cam?      

    Oh, every juicy detail,     
      I mean from her head      

   just slowly moving down...   

          Ah, into the          
      point of no return.       

       Oh yeah, brother!        

          Enters your           
     gravitational pull...      

      -Turner: Yeah-heah!       
     -Just wiggling around.     

     I mean if I'm the sun,     
   she is the closest planet    

          to the sun.           

        Whatever planet,        
        it's sucked in!         

       Exactly, you know        
        what I'm saying?        

   Brandon: Or she's like the   
  Millennium Falcon, you know,  

    when she's getting drawn    
    in by the tractor beam,     

     and she can't escape,      

    because she's helpless.     

   Jack, you must be reading    
 the longest damn birthday card 

    of all time over there.     

        Yeah seriously,         
        who's that from?        

     It's from Uncle Mike.      

 Oh Uncle Mike, how's he doing? 

    He's okay, he invited me    
   to come over to his place    

       over winter break.       

  Oh, just you and Uncle Mike,  

      that sounds lovely,       
         I'm not going.         

         Can I see it?          

  Okay, he didn't invite you.   

        Brandon: It says        
    he's not gonna be there.    

       Oh, tight as fuck,       
       definitely going.        

All of us, what do you say boys?

            I'm in!             

       I don't think it's       
      really a good idea.       

       Oh come on, Jack!        

   You gotta let me come, man   
         If I don't get         

  to go away for winter break,  

     my dad said he's gonna     
     make me work for him!      

      You know how fucking      
       lame that is man?        

      He works at Quiznos!      

    Look, Uncle Mike is not     
   really the epitome of fun.   

   Fuck Uncle Mike then. He's   
 not even gonna be there right? 

    He's not gonna be there.    

       See, just us boys!       

          Three guys.           

            -Hmm-mm.            
          -One cabin.           

             -Uhuh!             
      -Non-stop fellatio.       

           (gargling)           

     All night, from girls.     

        My God, with the        
     fucking touching man,      

      I'm trying to do my       
     own thing here, shit.      

     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.      

        (country music)         

   Hell man, I know my whole    
   family ain't getting into    

     heaven 'cause if I get     
     there, and I see them,     

     I'll know I'm in hell.     

I believe when I get to heaven, 

     I'm gonna get a lot of     
    just all that old pussy     

   I had before I got there.    
   It's gonna be right there    

     waiting for me again.      

    Yeah, but I don't really    
   worry though about dying.    

    It's not so much dying a    
    virgin, it's just dying     

        without like...         

        Doing anything.         

       Turner: Nah dude,        
        you'll be fine.         

    I've done a little bit.     

  Turner: You'll be good, man.  
    That's why we're taking     

    this little vacay, man.     
      I'm gonna teach you,      

     you're my little cub,      
      my little baby cub.       

  All right, I can be the cub.  

          Turner: Yeah          
     brother, that's right.     

       Brandon: Suckling        
        on her nipples.         

       Turner: Yeah, no,        
     no, no, none of that.      

           Well well.           

          Oof, oh man.          

   What the fuck is this man.   

   This is my uncle's house.    

   Turner: Well, I mean, was    
it in a fire or something man?  

       Brandon: Come on.        

      Turner: Place looks       
      like a fucking turd.      

        No, it's rustic.        

It's how it's supposed to look. 

    Turner: Okay, all right.    

  I'm just saying, this place   
    doesn't exactly give me,    

you know, warm cuddly feelings. 

    Brandon: Isn't that why     
   you brought your shotgun?    

  You're just a crazy person.   

       Turner: Just wait,       
      I got it, I got it.       

           Good grab.           

      Oh, a little chilly.      

          -Oh, sorry.           
        -Yeah, whatever.        

             Yeah.              

        Turner: At least        
     the inside looks nicer     

       than the outside!        

   Oh, shotgun biggest room!    

        Brandon: No way,        
    that's the coolest room!

    You're not complaining.     
  You brought it on yourself!   

             Man...             

     Turner: What the fuck.     

              Bro!              

        -Brandon: What?

     Oh, the breaker broke.     

         Turner: Yeah.          

  What are we supposed to do?   

       Live like, fucking       
     Jebediah and his Amish

  We'll call someone tomorrow.  

          No, I want a

    Where's our flashlight?     

        I don't know.           

   Turner: That's all right.    
         This'll work.          

       No it won't work!        
 I'm in the middle of a battle. 

   Can you pause it, please?    

  Would you pause it, Turner?   

  You're being inconsiderate.   

           (heaving)            

     Jack: Oh shit, shit...     

             Shit!              

       I got there, I got       
     there to pick you up,      

      I can get home safe.      

         Dude, you only         
      have your Learner's.      

         You don't have         
        a wallet on you.        

 You're wearing a garbage bag.  

        So where did you        
       sleep last night?        

          A dumpster.           

     Brandon: Why-- Why are     
   you sleeping in dumpster?    

         I don't know.          

You know if it's something weird
    like some fetish thing,     

      I get it, all right.      

    Let's just say I get it.    

      So you can tell me,       
     if you want, you know.     

   I'm into some nasty shit,    

      I'm sure you got a--      
         We're related.         

       You must have some       
     weird stuff going on.      

           Sexually.            

        Hey, all right!         

         Jack, honey...         

        Mommy has to go.        

  And I'm gonna take you over   
 to your cousin's house, okay?  

             Okay.              

  Promise me something, Jack.   

       When you turn 18,        

       if you feel sick,        

        don't be afraid.        

        Repeat after me.        

            (sniffs)            

         When I'm 18...         

      Jack: When I'm 18...      

       If I feel sick...        

    Jack: If I feel sick...     

    Mom:<i> I won't be afraid.</i>     

    Jack:<i> I won't be afraid.</i>    

      Turner:<i> Hey Crystal,</i>      
   <i> what's up? It's Turner.</i>     

 <i> What no, no, we haven't met.</i>  

  <i> It was the app just a few</i>    
    <i> minutes ago, remember?</i>     

     <i> No, no, I'm the guy</i>       
   <i> that sent you the photo</i>     

      <i> of just his balls.</i>       

     <i> Yeah, you wrote back</i>      
       <i> like right away.</i>        

  <i> Yeah, no, the cute balls.</i>    

     <i> Yeah, with the razor</i>      
      <i> blade next to it.</i>        

     Hey, come on, I swear      
    I'm not a serial killer.    

 I mean the app I'm using says  
   we're only two miles away.   

   Jack, where are you going?   

     Just out, for a walk.      

  Turner: Okay, tell me more.   

       (laughs) Oh, yeah        
      you're fucking wet.       

     Would you get off the      
  phone with your mom already?  

      Turner: I'll fucking      
    kill you I swear to God.    

         Just hang up!          

  Mike: So what's the status?   

     Mom: He has the gene.      

             Shit.              

    Well, I don't know what     
       we were expecting.       

  Mom: The chains didn't hold.  

  I need you to get the cage.   

          Mike:<i> That's</i>          
     <i> your responsibility.</i>      

     Mom: You know I can't.     
  Someone could recognize me.   

      I'll arrange to get       
       it there tomorrow.       

   Mom: He needs it tonight.    

 Well, I can't get it tonight.  

       Mom:<i> Mike, if you</i>        
    <i> don't wanna go back--</i>      

    Look, I've done my best     
     to lead a normal life,     

      and I'm not about to      
   fuck it all up right now.    

         We had a pact.         

        You're lucky I'm        
      even talking to you.      

       He's gonna have to       
      wait till tomorrow.       

       Turner:<i> Well, it's</i>       
   <i> not a fucking real road,</i>    

   <i> you fucking idiot, it's</i>     
    <i> a piece of cardboard.</i>

       Jesus, oh my God.        

       Brandon: Ah, shit.       

     What the fuck is this?     

  Brandon: Ah, it'll probably   
     turn on in the morning     

        like yesterday.         

  Ah, what the fuck man. This   
    is Jack's uncle's house.    

       He should be here        
    dealing with this shit.     

     Do you know the story      
      about Jack's family       

          by the way?           

   Yeah, his mom like shot up   
  his dad or something, right?  

  No, it goes way beyond that.  

          A lot more.           

     All right, well every      
      family has problems.      

      I mean, shit, my dad      
    used to be an alcoholic.    

 Still is, we just got over it. 

     They have a Wikipedia      
     page, just about them.     

            Oh, God.            

       Yeah, okay, it all       
       started with uhm,        

     <i> Jack's mom's oldest</i>       
       <i> sister Margaret.</i>        

    <i> She went into the city</i>     
      <i> with her boyfriend</i>       

<i>for a romantic night out, right,</i>

 <i> they were gonna get dinner.</i>   

       <i> And after dinner</i>        
      <i> he surprised her.</i>        

    <i> He had a hotel room at</i>     
     <i> the Waldorf Astoria.</i>      

 <i> It's great, it's fantastic,</i>   
      <i> it's a nice hotel.</i>       

   <i> I would do dirty things</i>     
    <i> to stay in that hotel.</i>     

      Turner:<i> You would do</i>      
    <i> dirty things for free.</i>     

     Brandon:<i> Yeah listen,</i>      
      <i> the next morning,</i>        

      <i> the maids come in,</i>       
      <i> boyfriend's dead.</i>        

     <i> Head split open like</i>      
    <i> a pumpkin, or a melon,</i>     

<i> or a watermelon, and Margaret,</i> 

     <i> she's handing from a</i>      
<i>chandelier, dead too obviously.</i> 

         Turner: Jesus.         

      She killed herself.       

    Yeah, oh, but you know,     

     Jack's mom, that gets      
       a little nastier.        

     <i> She took much longer</i>      
    <i> to go crazy, you know.</i>     

 <i> She waited, you know, years.</i>  

     <i> And then one night,</i>       
     <i> when Jack was around</i>      

   <i> five or six, his mother</i>     
     <i> just went ballistic.</i>      

    <i> Cut her husband's face</i>     
      <i> open with a razor.</i>       

       <i> Really tore in.</i>         

    <i> Like, gruesome, okay?</i>      

 <i> My parents, they still don't</i>  
   <i> understand how one night</i>    

      <i> a person could be</i>        
 <i> completely normal, friendly,</i>  

    <i> interesting, nice, and</i>     
  <i> then the next, homicidal.</i>    

  <i> They never even found her</i>    
   <i> body, just her clothes,</i>     

 <i> completely soaked in blood.</i>   

     Oh, but the worst one,     
   the worst incident by far    

 is Uncle Mike, our Uncle Mike. 

   <i> He was in Europe, taking</i>    
    <i> an overnight train</i>         

       <i> from Brussels to</i>        
 <i> Amsterdam. And the next day</i>   

    <i> when the train pulled</i>      
       <i> into the station</i>        

    <i> and the conductor came</i>     
      <i> to open the doors,</i>       

   <i> he found 12 bodies, dead</i>    
  <i> people, just slaughtered,</i>    

      <i> torn-up, cast all</i>        
       <i> over the walls.</i>         

     <i> You know it was just</i>      
  <i> disgusting. There was guts</i>   

  <i> everywhere, it was really</i>    
     <i> just gruesome stuff,</i>      

    <i> awful stuff. The only</i>      
      <i> guy that made it,</i>        

      <i> was Uncle Mike, so</i>       
  <i> naturally he's a suspect,</i>    

  <i> but they couldn't find his</i>   
   <i> fingerprints on anything</i>    

        <i> and frankly it</i>         
    <i> didn't make any sense</i>      

   <i> that a scrawny teenager</i>     
  <i> could've killed an entire</i>    

<i> car full of people, you know?</i>  

       Not like the way,        
    whoever did it, did it,     

      because he tore like      
       jaws off and shit,       

         I mean God...          

   Holy shit, you're fucking    
    related to these people.    

        No, it's through        
       Jack's father, so,       

        I'm not psycho.         

             Whew.              

        All right, that         
      really tired me out.      

      I'm gonna go to bed.      

  You should bundle up, okay,   

        the heat's off.         

          I love you.           

           (moaning)

           I'm Gonzo.           

 Well, did she fix you a drink? 

       Rose, did you fix        
       our guest a drink?       

    He didn't want a drink.     

      Just because you're       
     settled and sobered up     

 doesn't mean our guest has to. 

   Jack: No really, I'm fine.

        the good scotch.        

             Rocks?             

    You'll have to excuse my    
    wife's poor hospitality.    

         She looks sexy

    but she just isn't into

         Guests first.          

          Have a seat.          

    No, you wanna hold that

       So what brings you

        I told your wife        
      I heard the attack.       

    Oh shit, so you were        
     there when that nig...     

 When Morris Wright got killed. 

   It ripped his whole bottom   
      half off, didn't it?

 <i> Oh, I'm ready to bake cakes,</i>

          let me know.          

  Rose: Thank you for coming.   

    Hey, what are you doing?    

     Just rolling a joint.      

      Yeah, it's kind of a      
     big milestone for me,      

       so, if you cannot        
       just hover over me       

        that'd be great.        

      Why are there Animal      
 Crackers all over the ground?  

       I don't know, I'm        
       not really focused       

    on the Animal Crackers,     
 because this is my second time 

   smoking, so it's gonna be    
  my first time getting high,   

    so it has to be perfect.    

    See it's, not too tight.    

You gotta let the grass breathe.

       Lesson number one.       

      Jack: All right come      
     to my room, all right?     

  Okay, I'll be there as s...   
           Oh, shit.            

         -Howdy-doody.

             Okay.              

     What are we watching?      

        Just watch this.        

           (growling)           

      Well that's creepy.       
          What is it?           

     Like a YouTube video?      

    No it's from the GoPro.     

           (chewing)            

        Is that the girl        
         from the news?

 (screams) You killed someone,  

      you killed somebody.      

    I think I'm a werewolf.     

      That's a really bad       
   legal defense, all right.    

      We're gonna need to       
     get a lawyer. We need      
        to work on that.        

    Look, look at the hands.    

     Those aren't my hands.     

          Oh, my God.           

  Do you think I'll turn soon?  

    We should call someone.     

  What happened to your dick?   
   That's the real question,    
           you know.            

    Did that transform too?     
    Did it get much bigger?     

             -What?             
      -That would be good.      

     You should definitely      
         call someone.

   last like one more night?    

     Brandon:<i> No, the moon</i>      
  <i> only has to basically full</i>   

    <i> for you to transform.</i>      
      <i> And I'm looking at</i>       

   <i> the lunar calendar, and</i>     
    <i> it says that we've got</i>     

     <i> four more nights of</i>       
    <i> basically full moons.</i>      

     We're losing sun. This     
    is-- Oh, fucking Christ.    

  Okay, if the sun goes down,   

 I'm dropping you in the woods. 

 Because I don't think I should 
  be in the same car with you.  

            Thanks.             

      What do you expect,       

   I'm not gonna die for you.   

 Well, I mean I'd die for you-- 
    I'm not gonna just die.     

  I'm not even dying for you,   
  you would just be eating me.  

 I'm not gonna be your dinner.  

     I'd sacrifice myself,      

          but that's a          
      different situation.      

     Anyway, I don't wanna      
    have to explain myself.     

       Jack: Hi, I'm here       
     to pick something up.      

             Name?              

    Jack: Jack, Jack Luskey.    

              ID?               

           I lost it.           

      We're in a big rush,      

       if there's any way       
      you could hurry up,       

         it'd be great.         

   Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.   

           Out there.           

        Jack: Excuse me?        

              Wow.              

  Yeah that's a nice one, hah.  

Has a little wear and tear,     
    but it's sturdy as hell.    

    Must've been a rich lady    
  to afford a cage like that.   

      Real nice lady too.       

       This is excellent        
       ironwork up here.        

         Son, would you         
      get down from there       

   before you kill yourself?    

             Sorry.             

       Sorry about that.        

    The truck's for me too?     

       I'll drive my car.       

            Fellas?             

           (moaning)            

      Crystal: I'm so hot.      

      Yeah, yeah you are.       

    You're hotter than your     
 profile picture, that's rare.  

     (laughs) That's gotta      
      be the nicest thing       

  anybody has ever said to me.  

        Hey, do you know        
      about law and stuff?      

     Well, that's kinda non     
     sequitur, but I guess.     

         I just, I got          
       this friend Jimmy        

       and he was asking        
        me if, you know,        

      if an intruder broke      
        into your house         

  and, and this intruder, say,  

     had a record, and was      
       wanted for murder,       

   and, and you killed them,    

        is that a crime?        

     Well it doesn't matter     
     if they're a murderer,     

        in order to kill        
   somebody you have to feel    

  like your life's in danger.   

  Yeah but it wouldn't matter   
   either way, though, right?   

    He wouldn't get punished    
   if this was a bad person.    

    Okay, well, the Jew that    
    killed Lee Harvey Oswald    

     still got in trouble.      

          Are we good?          

  Yeah, fuck, sorry, I'm just   
a little out of it I guess.     

           (moaning)            

    I don't know, maybe I'm     
   just not in the mood, I...   

     Well, that's not what      
     this little guy says.      

           Oh, oh...            

    It's funny you say that,    

     'cause I actually call     
       him Little Turner.       

      Oh, so he's little.       

   Oh, he never stays little.   

       That's the trick.        

           (moaning)            

         I got an idea.         

       Now, what's that.        

    You care if I film this?    

     Only if I get a copy.      

   (laughs) You are amazing.    

        Hmm, come here.         

     -You stay right here.      
           -Will do.            

          Don't move!           

          All right...          

     Fuck it's not in here.     

   Crystal: Forget about it.    

      I know where it is,       
     just stay right here,      

          don't move!           

       Hold that thought.       

            (farts)             

         What the f...          

             Fuck.              

    -Brandon: What's wrong?     
            -No gas.            

           Oh, shit.            

      The car doesn't have      
  a warning light or anything?  

              Man.              

      Jack: How much time       
      do you think we got?      

     Oh God, I don't know,      
 when do you usually transform? 

         I don't know.          

    Do you think we can put     
   the cage in the other car?   

        Nah no way, it's        
         way too small.         

      Ah shit, shit, shit,      
        shit, shit man!         

Shit, we're in big trouble here!

          Jack: Relax,          
      we're gonna be fine.      

   No, you're gonna be fine.    

     You're gonna be okay,      

         and I'm gonna,         
      you're gonna eat me.      

  Jack: Help me with the cage.  

      See if the werewolf       
        in you eats me,         

   it's not 'cause it's evil,   

  it's because it's a monster.  

      Jack: This is good.       

       Brandon: See, so,        
     if the werewolf in you     

      eats me, it doesn't       
         make it evil,          

 it's just a monster, you know. 

      It doesn't have any       
        control over it.        

       Jack: That sounds        
       pretty evil to me.       

     Brandon: No not if you     
 don't have a choice, see like, 

    you know like the Hulk,     
       see with the Hulk,       

     you put the Hulk in a      
terrorist base it just destroys 

       everything in it's       
     path, and he's a hero.     

     He's off the hook, in      
      a church, and yeah,       

   he's obviously not a hero.   

That's what makes it a monster, 
   he doesn't have a choice.    

     Okay, the lock is on.      

          Jack: Good.           

          Take off all          
       your clothes then.       

    Jack: Gimme your watch.     

  Brandon: All right but why,   
I really like this watch.       

     Just gimme your watch.     
       I won't break it.        

             Okay.              

           All right.           

         -There you go.         
        -Jack: Thanks.          

 And now take off your clothes. 

          Jack: What?           

      Brandon: I need your      
    clothes, you'll rip 'em     

      when you transform.       

       Come on, hurry up,       
    hurry up, please.           

     Jack: All right fine.      

             -Here.             
             -Okay.             

           Thank you.           

      Oh and the jacket, I      
      need the jacket too.      

         Jack: No, I'll         
        keep my jacket.         

     No, no, no you'll tear     
     it when you transform.     

    It's a nice jacket, you     
 don't wanna year that jacket.  

        Jack: I'll take         
         it off before.         

         What if you're         
      not able to, though?      

        It'll be like an        
       experience, yeah?        

  You love experiences, right?  

      I do like ex-- Okay.      

           All right.           

     Jack: Get outta here!      

       No, I wanna watch.       

        No, uh, Brandon         
        get out of here,        

      you saw the footage.      

        Ah, fine, okay!         

           All right.           

             -Wait.             
        -Brandon: What?         

    What do I do about food?    

    Uh, oh I got crackers.      

          Jack: Shit.           

     Brandon: I'll see you      
  later, good luck, good bye.   

    Rose: Can you walk Joey?    

    And what would be the       
   point of that, sweetheart?   

        He needs to get         
       out, it's healthy.       

    That dog ain't healthy.     

       And it ain't never       
       gonna be healthy,        

    'cause I am not spending    
      $10,000 of my money       

     to fix his broke ass.      

           All right.           

         I'll walk him.         

    Come here Joey boy, yes.    

      Let's go for a walk.      

      Let's me and you go       
    for a walk, Mommy said,     

     "Let's go for a walk."     

 So, let's take you for a walk. 

           Out we go.           

          (gun fires)           

         Holy shit, you         
      wouldn't believe it.      

    His legs must've healed.    
          He ran away.          

       Good night, babe.        

          (gun fires)           

      All right babe, so,       
     this is the Remington      

 12 Gauge, I'm gonna teach you  
   how to fire this shotgun.    

      Girl as fucking sexy      
     as you, needs to know      

   how to fire a gun, right?    

 Too many predators out there.  

            I know!             

   So you're gonna take-- You   
got your safety mechanism here, 

       the trigger. This        
     is where you're gonna      

       -throw the shell.        
            -Okay.              

       You wanna throw it       
    in there, you cock it,      

       put it up to your        
   shoulder, find your target   

           and fire.            

    All right, so there's no    
   ammo now, I just want you    

        to learn how to         
       like hold the gun,       

get a sense of the weight of it.

       Seems easy enough.       

       Yeah, yeah, yeah.        

 Here we go. Right, you got it. 

   I need like a smaller one.   

   Yeah, I'll get you a mini.   

           (laughing)           

   All right, so just aim at    
    like them flock of birds    

   out in the distance there,   

     no ammo, but just you      
    know, get a sense of it.    

             Poof!              

     There you go, oh baby,     
     you're so fucking good     

  with a fucking shotgun, hmm!  

          Jack, Jack?           

     Open the fucking cage.     

       Okay, one second.        

           It's open.           

         What is that?          

     Oh, sorry about that.      
        That's nothing.         

          Here you go,          

   you should get in the car,   
    it's warmed up for you.     

All right, come here, come here.

This is so Brokeback right now. 

            Oh shit.            

       We can't have him        
      knowing about this.       

         Brandon: Why?          

       Because I fucking        
        killed someone.         

        Oh right, yeah.         

  That's fucked up by the way.  

     Turner: Yeah, morning      
       to you too, Jack.        

              -Hi.              
              -Hi.              

          Hey, hello.           

    So you got a new truck?     

   And what's with the cage?    

        Uh, this is for         
       Uncle Mike's cat.        

    Oh my God, I love cats.     

    That cage is for a cat?     

 That cat must be fat as shit.  

        Yeah, well it's         
        an outdoors cat,        

       so it just mostly        
      sticks in the back.       

         -Turner: Uhuh.         
        -Hunts rodents.         

     Can we play with her?      

      Brandon: Sure if you      
     could find her, yeah.      

     Crystal: Kitty, kitty!     

         Brandon: Who's         
     that girl by the way?      

     What her? Yeah, that's     
      uh-- That's Crystal.      

   Yeah, she's my slam piece.   

       Met her online and       
     God she just gives me      

      the biggest boners.       

        That's romantic.        

        Yeah, well I'll         
        let you get back        

  to whatever the fuck Houdini  
     trick you're planning,     

        I'm outta here.         

             -Baby!             
      -Brandon: Have fun.       

        (door knocking)         

     Yeah one sec, Brandon.     

        Oh, hey Turner.         

           Hey, man.            

         I feel like we         
      haven't chilled much      

       since we got here.       

          Yeah I know.          

              Hmm.              

      Sorry, I've just not      
     been feeling too well.     

    Yeah, that's all right.     

  By the way, you haven't seen  
  the GoPro anywhere have you?  

            No, no.             

     That's funny, 'cause I     
actually found it in this room, 

   just the other night. All    
   footage mysteriously gone    

           off of it.           

         -That's weird.         
         -Turner: Yeah.         

      Must've been Brandon      
  making one of those movies.   

      One of those movies?      

        Jack: You know.         

             Yeah.              

      Well, this was fun.       

        Let's chill some        
        more, all right?        

       Jack: Definitely.        

             Okay.              

           (groaning)           

        Oh, can I get my        
     watch back by the way?     

   -Jack: Oh I still need it.   
           -Oh, why?            

             Wow...             

      All right, awesome.       

  I'll set the watch for you.   

     And I'm setting it to      

             20:22.             

         -There you go.         
        -(door knocking)        

            Thanks.             

    I got it. Don't worry.      

              Hi.               

 Can I help you with something? 

       Gonzo:<i> Hey Jacky,</i>        
        <i> how you doing?</i>         

    Oh no, this is Brandon.     

            Brandon.            

       What's up, kiddo?        

        Oh nothing much,        
      I'm just mapping out      

        some strategies.        

      Uh, heck strategies.      

   <i> For uh, future tourneys.</i>    

   <i> It's Settlers of Catan.</i>     

          Do you play?          

    Yeah that's great homie.    

   Listen, where's Jacky at?    

     Wait uh, who are you?      

     I'm that motherfucker.     

    Hah, could you be           
     more specific please?      

          It's Gonzo.           

  Tell him to come by my spot.  

     He knows where I'm at.     

       Bring Jack out or        
     I'll crush your skull.     

    Uh, do you know a Gonzo?    

       I don't think he's       
     gonna come, I'm sorry.     

   If it was me, I would go.    

     Ah okay, well this...      

    I don't know if you need    
     to be this rough, sir,     

         I think it's a         
      little unnecessary.       

      So uhm, if you could      
       have him back here       

before eight o'clock, and that's
   really important you know.   

  I really-- That's essential.  

       If you could have        
       him before eight.        

      (car engine revving)      

      Eight o'clock, okay?      

   Hey Jacky, how you doing?    

    Can I get you anything?     

     A cigarette, a scotch?     

   Oh right, you don't drink.   

             Coke?              

       I'm fine, thanks.        

              So.               

           Jacky boy.           

  What did you see that night   
     at the train station?      

     I don't remember much.     

    You don't remember much?    

      Well Rose was there.      

 And then the black bear came.  

       And then Rose came       
        running to help         

 when she heard some screaming. 

        So my candy-ass,        

      narrow-behind wife,       

     came running when she      
      heard some screaming      

      from a motherfucker       
       she doesn't know,        

     who was being attacked     
        by a black bear.        

    You know Jack, a lot of     
    people are afraid of me.    

    Do you know why a lot of    
    people are afraid of me?    

      Because I'm strong.       

     And yet I am a pillar      
       to the community.        

       You know I donate        
     over 10% of my profits     

  to the Boys and Girls club?   

      I love kids, Jacky.       

              See.              

     The key to my business     

       is know the truth,       
       avoid the sleuth.        

    Now, I avoid the sleuth.    

     And you best believe I     
     wanna know the truth.      

     So I'm only gonna ask      
       you one more time.       

     Was that motherfucker      
      at the train station      

         with my wife?          

        They were there,        
       but not together.        

             Okay.              

             Okay.              

             Okay.              

          Hey listen.           

   Next time you see my wife,   

         text me, okay?         

       Baby, I think Jack       
    should stay for dinner.     

      I don't see why not.      

            I can't.            

             Stay.              

  I made plans with my cousin.  

        -Brandon?               
          -Jack: Yeah.          

           Hmm, well.           

        Is that the kid         
     that followed us here?     

           Uh, well.            

         Bon appetite.          

      Hey, ain't that the       
      chick from the news?      

      No, don't be racist.      

       Did you boys ever        
        try a tapenade?         

    I make a mean tapenade.     

       You know, it's my        
grandmother's recipe actually.  

   When my grandmother died,    

she passed it down to my mother,

     and when my mama died,     

        she passed it to        
       my older brother.        

       And when my older        
     brother was murdered,      

       I found the recipe       
         in his wallet.         

            Hmm, so.            

        Brandon, Turner.        

         Where you guys         
      at the train station      
     that night with Jack?      

    Brandon: No, we weren't.    

    What night? Who's this?     

   Could we change the topic?   

         No, I'm sorry          
      what night is this?       

        Could you please        
       pass the tapenade?       

 It seems evident that you boys 

       were not there the       
    night that Morris Wright    

     was tragically killed.     

         Yeah, why were         
        you there, Jack?        

     You never told me you      
    went to a train station.    

       I thought we told        
    each other everything,      

       all of the sudden        
    you're keeping secrets?     

   Why were you at the train    
   station the other night--    

       Well I would like        
        to make a toast.        

     Never mind, I'm sorry.     

     Nah, go ahead Brandon.     

         Make a toast.          

         No it's fine.          

         Make a toast!          

             Okay.              

             Uh...              

     Well, this is a lovely     
   house, it's very exciting    

    to be here, for dinner.     

And uh, I had a tough semester  

        last semester at        
       college, socially.       

        But I made it, I        
    persevered thanks to my     

        two best friends        
       here, who I love.        

      And uh, it's really       
        exciting, again,        

   to be meeting all of you.    

        Especially Carl.        

        And uh, yeah.           

       I'm excited to see       
        where this goes.        

           Thank you.           

              Ah.               

         To friendship.         

   And whatever the fuck that   
 little guy was talking about.  

    And now that our palates    
      have been cleansed,       

         the tapenade.          

        In a few seconds        
    meet me in the kitchen.     

       I'm gonna go check       
        on the chicken.         

          This is some          
      fantastic tapenade.       

    I think it's excellent,     
         really great.          

       It's always great.       

  Do you need help with that?   

        Can you help me?        

             -Yeah.             
        -Not with that.         

       He killed the dog.       

        He killed Joey.         

       Uhm, I'm so sorry.       

       And now he thinks        
       I was with Morris.       

    I told him you weren't,     

 so there's no way he'll know.  

 I'm gonna start showing soon.  

        You're pregnant?        

         Babies cost a          
      lot more than dogs.       

       (faint chattering)       

    He wouldn't kill a baby.    

     Yeah, if it were his.      

        Can you help me?        

     Gonzo:<i> Rose, we're two</i>     
   <i> sets in, and no entree.</i>     

            Please.             

           I don't--            

         Get the rice.          

        Turner:<i> And that</i>        
      <i> is the first time</i>        

<i> Brandon ever sucked on a dick.</i> 

      That's a true story.      

           I'm sure.            

        Only last week?         

       Turner: Yeah man,        
     it was just last week,     

      she was like, who's       
        this little kid,        

      and I was like, oh,       
      his name is Brandon.      

   Brandon: I don't remember    
  saying exactly those words.   

         Turner: Yeah,          
   whatever, you were drunk.    

  Ah, anyway, that looks nice.  

    Say, what kind of scotch    
  are we drinking by the way?   

        Gonzo: Currently        
      Johnnie Walker Blue.      

       Turner: I've heard       
    of Johnnie Walker Black.    

             Gonzo:             
Welcome to the Blue. son.       

    I'm feeling kinda sick.     

  Brandon can get I the keys.   

         Oh yeah, yeah.         

         You're leaving         
    before the entree Jack?     

         Yeah, stay for         
       the entree, Jack.        

       I would, I'm just        
     feeling very nauseous.     

  Thanks for the hospitality.   

    I enjoyed the tapenade.     

   Okay, we gotta follow him.   

    Why, to watch him vomit?    

 No, no, something ain't right, 

      and I wanna fix it.       

      It'd be really rude.      
      We can't just leave.      

        Ahem, excuse me,        
        Mr. Gonzo, uhm,         

    may I please be excused.    

       Now what is going        
        on here fellas?         

Did you not enjoy the tapenade. 

       No, no, I did very       
        much, very much,        

        thank you again         
      for that, I'm just,       

   concerned with my friend.    
  I wanna make sure he's okay.  

           Sure, go.            

 Hey Carl, I'll call you later. 

     Thank you for dinner.      

        Wait, this isn't        
        the fucking way.        

         Oh, I'm taking         
       the scenic route.        

   The fucking scenic route?    

   Do I look like I have time   
   to take the scenic route?    

 I'm calling the fucking cops.  

     No, please don't call      
       the cops, no cops.       

     Fuck you, man. You're      
     trying to protect him      

    with that cage bullshit.    
 I know something is going on.  

       I'm not trying to        
   protect him, I'm just not    

     <i> trying to bust him,</i>       
       <i> that's all okay.</i>        

     <i> You know, it's Jack.</i>      

    <i> It's gonna be one huge</i>     
<i>misunderstanding, I can feel it.</i>

  No, no, no you have exactly   
    two minutes to get there    

before I call the fucking cops. 

     Fine, call the police.     

     Let 'em come and find      
    Jack vomiting, big deal.    

      That's not a crime.       

       I mean, we're the        
     ones with weed on us.      

 You think that's a smart idea  

    to call the police when     
      we have weed on us?       

It's not, it's not a smart idea.

       Turner: Go, nine.        

      Fine, I don't care.       

         -Turner: One.          
    -It's your own funeral.     

             -One!              
  -All right, all right, okay.  

             Stop.              

         I'll take you.         

    Goddamn right you will.     

    Ssshht, ssshht, shut the    
   fuck up, shut the fuck up.   

     I don't hear anything.     

    That's really good news,    
     that's such good news,     

     because that, our job      
 is done here then. That's it.  

       I don't think so.        
  I wanna know what's in here.  

  All right, wait one second.   
     Will you, wait, wait.      

     Let's not go in there.     

              Why?              

     I have, I've had some      
   homosexual feelings lately   

         towards you...         

  Turner: Oh my God, Brandon.   

        And I wanted to         
     talk to you about it.      

  It can hurt our friendship.   

         Don't fucking          
       lie to me Brandon.       

    Don't fucking lie to me.    
  I will open this damn door.   

   Don't fucking lie to me--    

 All right, fine, I won't lie!  

          What, what?           

      Jack's in there and       
      he's a werewolf now.      

    And he's gonna turn         
        into a werewolf,        

       and then we go in        
        and he kills us.        

          Now you are           
     goddamn full of shit.      

         He'll kill us!         

  Get off, get off me Brandon,  

    I'm not fucking kidding.    
  Now open that goddamn door.   

        All right, fine.        

           Fuck man.            

  Brandon: Hey Jack, it's us.   

       What the fuck are        
      you guys doing here?      

       What the fuck are        
       you doing in here?       

       I'm sleeping here.       

      What kind of fucked       
    up psycho-creep are you?    

          Turner, you           
      gotta listen to me,       

    go upstairs now, please.    

     Brandon, help me out!      

       No, don't talk to        
       Brandon all right.       

       I know you two are       
        full of secrets.        

     Now, tell me what the      
       hell is going on.        

     Turner, I will explain     
      everything tomorrow.      

      Right now, you just       
     gotta get outta here.      

      Well, this wouldn't       
       be the first time        

  a member of your family has   
   had some explaining to do.   

           (beeping)            

           Oh, shit.            

        Turner: Hey, you        
      know, get back here!      

    -Brandon, get the lock!     
      -Brandon: Oh, shit!       

       No, no, no, I know       
      something is up man.      

     This fucking cage, and     
  you're staking out at night,  

     and the bloody GoPro.      

     Turner, you should...      
             Aahh!              

           (growling)           

      -Turner: Oh, my God!      
        -Brandon: Shit.         

           (growling)           

         Turn the lock!         

           Oh, fuck.            

       Fuck, fuck, fuck!        

           (growling)           

            Oh, God!            

       Fuck, fuck, fuck!        

      Oh my God, oh fuck.       

           (growling)           

          (gun fires)           

             Fuck!              

            Brandon!            

            Brandon.            

   Brandon come on, come on.    

       Come on, Brandon,        

       Brandon, come on.        

            Come on.            

            Come on.            

       Brandon, hey, hey!       

      We're gonna get you       
        to the hospital.        

     You're gonna be okay.      

 -You should've seen yourself.  
     -Jack: That wasn't me.     

      You looked awesome.       

        Jack: It was the        
      werewolf, I'm sorry.      

            Come on.            

       Call, please call        
       a prostitute, man.       

              Why?              

  I don't wanna die a virgin.   

     Do you think I'll have     
   enough blood for a boner?    

    It's gonna be okay.         
    You're gonna have live.     

           (heaving)            

        (phone dialing)         

        Come on Brandon,        
        come on Brandon.        

        (phone ringing)         

     Come on Brandon, pick      
     up the fucking phone.      

            Come on.            

             Fuck!              

     Come on Brandon, fuck!     

        (phone ringing)         

     Mike:<i> Hey, it's Mike.</i>      

  <i> I haven't heard from you.</i>    

     <i> I hope you're okay.</i>       

     <i> Look, we had a pact.</i>      

     The gene was supposed      
        to die with us.         

   I thought that was clear.    

   <i> I don't know what you're</i>    
   <i> trying to sustain here.</i>     

    <i> Sedating Jack, hoping</i>      
      <i> he finds the cage.</i>       

   <i> This is no way to live.</i>     

          (gun fires)           

          (gun cocks)           

         (bell ringing)         

   What the fuck is going on?   

  The lady, why was she here?   

     What else do you know?     
     Did she say anything?      

     And the cage? Why now?     

    Welcome to Nana's Attic.    

       You will never get       
      the answers you want      

       by asking so many        
       goddamn questions.       

     So you know something?     

       No, that was just        
       a piece of advice.       

   Unfortunately in this case   

     I genuinely don't have     
    an idea of what the fuck    

     you're talking about.      

         You got a map?         

       Where you headed?        

             West.              

            West?               

      You don't need a map      
     to follow the sunset.      

     I'm going to Colorado.     

        That's a pretty         
        good road trip.         

     You'll be on I-80 West     
     for about 2,000 miles      

  till you hit the mountains.   

      I don't imagine you       
       would make a trip        

     like that by yourself.     

         I'll be fine.          

        No son, I don't         
       think you will be.       

 What about that nice lady who  
 bought you those nice things?  

  Maybe she could go with you?  

       Or what about that       
        friend of yours?        

        The strange one.        

      They're not coming.       

              Son.              

         10 years ago I         
       had a lot of shit.       

  My wife was battling cancer.  

      My son went bankrupt      
          in the city.          

     And my momma couldn't      
       remember my name.        

      A man is measured by      
    the weight of the people    

        leaning on him.         

      But too many people       
  leaning can knock you down.   

     You're being a bitch.      

      I'm just going west.      

      West, north, south,       
      fucking Antarctica.       

    No matter where you go,     
     you're being a bitch.      

       Not so fast, son.        

      This makes two times      
    you've been in my store     

     and you haven't bought     
        a goddamn thing.        

    My advice may be cheap,     
       but it ain't free.       

         We'll fix the          
       problem tomorrow.        

         I forgive you.         

    Turner: Fuck, goddammit.    

 Remember, your worst quality,  

  can also be your best, okay?  

 <i> Promise me something, Jack.</i>   

       <i> Don't be afraid.</i>        

       <i> If the werewolf</i>         
       <i> in you eats me,</i>         

  <i> that doesn't make it evil.</i>   

<i>It's just a monster, it doesn't</i> 
  <i> have any control over it,</i>    

<i>that's what makes it a monster,</i> 
  <i> it doesn't have a choice.</i>    

         Oh, what's up?         

   Do you have anything else?   

            Not yet.            

    You gotta trust me.         

        Hold on to this.        

  And drive over to my place.   

    See you in the morning.     

    Crystal: Check this out!    

    What, oh babe thank you,    

 but I'm just not very hungry,  

    I appreciate it though.     

 Okay, uhm, well, I guess I'll  

just put it in the fridge, uhm, 

     I'm probably gonna go.     

         What, no! Why?         

      Well I don't really       
      know why I even came      

      after the last time.      

     Oh come on, I'm sorry,     

   and I'm sorry about that,    

      that was total horse      
        shit on my part,        

   and I know I disappointed    
      you the other night,      

    and I want tonight to be    
   special for us, all right?   

Can you give me one more chance?

            I guess.            

             Yeah?              

    You do look a little off    
        and I feel bad.         

     All right, that's all      
   right, how about tonight,    

      you, me, and Little       
        Turner hang out.        

    Hmm, what do you think?     

            Hmmm...             

     I mean I didn't drive      
   over here for nothing, so.   

     Oh, I know, oh I know,     

       I'll make it worth       
     your while, all right?     

       Okay, but this is        
       your last chance.        

          Okay, so why          
      don't you get ready?      

       And I'll meet you        
   upstairs in five minutes.    

     -Crystal: Sounds good.     
          -All right.           

           Oh fuck...           

   Jacky what are you doing?    

     Jack: I'm just getting     
      myself some scotch.       

            (laughs)            

    You have got some balls     
      coming here tonight.      

    You lying motherfucker.     

    Well, enjoy that scotch.    

       Because I am about       
       to beat your ass.        

         What the fuck?         

          (scuffling)           

     I am going to end you,     
         motherfucker!          

           Hmm, damn.           

           (giggles)            

   All righty, let's do this.   

           (clicking)           

            Turner?             

      Well Jack, it seems       
    you like to play games.     

Let's play one of my favorites. 

   Now the rules are simple.    

    My boys are gonna press     

    pressure points on you.     

     You are gonna scream.      

       And then I'll give       
     you this stress ball,      

 you can squeeze it, hopefully  
   it'll help calm you down.    

         Carl told me.          

     You lied to me, Jack.      

       You shouldn't lie.       

           (beeping)            

             Boys.              

            Turner?             

             Babe?              

            Turner?             

 I swear to God if you scare me 

 I'm not gonna suck your dick.  

          (screaming)           

          (screaming)           

  Oh yeah, you feel that, huh?  

Do you get the point, Jack?     

     Don't lie to me Jack.      

             Never!             

  What the fuck is this guy--?  

             Shit.              

           (growling)           

         What the fuck?         

             Fuck!              

        Fuck this shit.         

           (growling)           

          (gun fires)           

     Oh shit, I shot Carl.      

         Motherfucker!          

    Carl man, are you okay?     

      Shit, motherfucker,       
   don't you know how to aim?   

           (growling)           

      Oh my God, is that?       

     Turner, it's the cat.      

    Turner, I found the cat.    

     You're gonna miss it.      

           (growling)           

       (popcorn cracking)       

           (heaving)            

          -(growling)           
          -(screaming)          

          Holy fuck...          

           (growling)           

           (choking)            

            Jack...             

        (gasping)               

           (growling)           

           (growling)           

            Crystal?            

      Holy shit! (laughs)       

           Oh, baby.            

     What the hell did you      
      do to me last night?      

      Oh, I can't remember      
        a goddamn thing.        

 All right, baby where are you? 

      You want some milk?       

            (yawns)             

              Oh!               

      (weeping) Oh, no...       

         What the fuck.         

         Motherfucker!          

             Fuck!              

      Jack: Where's Rose?       

           Follow me.           

      No, I'll follow you.      

            Inside.             

          In the barn.          

          In the cage.          

   Jack: What are you doing?    

     Just get in the cage.      

 Still got that watch of yours? 

          Jack: Yeah.           

         Give it to me.         

           (beeping)            

You got an alarm set for 20:22. 

     I'll see you at 20:20.     

           (heaving)            

           (beeping)            

            Get up.             

          Over there.           

          Right there.          

   Get out of the cage, Jack.   

   Get out of the cage, Jack.   

          Over there.           

           (beeping)            

    Jack: Turner, you gotta     
    put me back in the cage.    

        No, no, no, time        
       to confess, Jack.        

 And you don't have much time.  

      Turner, I gotta get       
       back to that cage.       

   Turner: One more step and    
   I'll shoot you right now.    

      You won't shoot me.       

         I'll shoot you         
       right fucking now.       

   Just like I shot your mom.   

     There's my confession.     

    Now answer my questions.    

     Did you kill Brandon?      

  What do you want out of it?   

     Did you kill Brandon?      

              Yes.              

      Did you kill Morris?      

             Yeah.              

   And did you kill Crystal?    

              No.               

        She was torn up         
     just like Brandon was.     

       Did you kill her?        

       Turner I swear, I        
      didn't kill Crystal.      

       Okay, I gotta get        
       back to that cage.       

         No, no, no one         
        is gonna believe        

   there's a werewolf, unless   
     it's caught on camera.     

          Look at him.          

     All these murders are      
  getting put on the werewolf,  

      that I'm gonna kill       
     with my silver bullet.     

         Silver bullet?         

             What?              

          (gun cocks)           

 Five seconds till I'm a hero.  

       Turner, that's not       
      gonna fucking work.       

       You gotta shoot me       
       now, kill me now--       

        Shut the fuck up        
    Jack, shut the fuck up!     

            Oh, God!            

           (growling)           

         - (scuffling)          
          - (growling)          

        (distorted) I'm         
       the good guy here.       

       He killed Morris.        

          (gun cocks)           

            (laughs)            

       (distorted) I will       
         kill you both,         

      you can only kill a       
  werewolf with a silver bu--   

          -(thumping)           
          -(groaning)           

     (distorted) I'm sorry.     

    Get in the fucking cage.    

        (distorted) I'm         
       not gonna make it.       

        Get in the cage.        

           (growling)           

          (whimpering)          

          (gun fires)           

  Mike: Welcome to the family.
