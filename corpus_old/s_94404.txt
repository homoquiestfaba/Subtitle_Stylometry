Castlegard.

Clear!

250.
250 ready.

Clear!

300.
300 ready.

Clear!

He's gone.

lt's over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice-cold hands.

Apart from external wounds,
everything is out of alignment.

Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.

Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn't line up.

And now the spine.

Same thing. Same shift
right across the third vertebrae.

This guy looks like a paper doll
got cut up and pasted back together.

No wallet. No lD.
Just this thing around his neck.

lt says lTC on it,
so we called them.

That outfit in the desert.
Our biggest contributors.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

Frank Gordon, lTC.

l'm here to pick up
Vince Taub's body.

l'm Dr. Cova.
l'll take care of that paperwork.

Thank you.

Vincent Taub, huh?

That's Vinnie's good-luck charm.
Thank you.

Pretty sad when your time comes and
no one claims you but your employer.

Excuse me, sheriff.
Sure.

Gordon.

l'm picking up the body
right now.

{Y:i}- Was he alone or with Decker?
Taub's the only one here.

Get the body out of there.
And x-rays and records.

Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?

No, there's no problem.
They've been very accommodating.

lf this gets out, lTC is ruined.

Any idea how he ended up
in the desert?

l don't know. Maybe he used his
marker without enough clearance.

lt could be a million things.
Not too bright.

He's dead, Robert.

Taub is dead.

Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way,
what's Castlegard?

l heard that's the only word
he said, ''Castlegard''.

Sounds like an amusement park.

Listen up, class. April 4, 1357.
Castlegard, France.

The English army in their red uniforms
occupied the village of Castlegard.

The French, meanwhile,
were advancing,

trying to drive them out of there,
in this direction over the river,

past the monastery and up
and over to the heights here.

Just leave it, Chris, that's fine,
before you wreck the place.

The English army, meanwhile,
had retreated to Castle La Roque.

Well fortified, very strong,
very well supplied,

and both sides had settled in
for a long siege.

The French were trying to push
the English out of France.

Lord Oliver tries to take the fight
out of the French.

Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.

A woman of class
and a woman of nobility,

Commander Arnaut's sister,
Lady Claire.

He hangs her from the battlements
for all of the French forces to see.

lnstead of demoralizing the French,
it whips them into a frenzy,

and they attack the castle
like madmen,

and they overpower the English
with sheer passion.

So the fortress of La Roque
fell in one night

because of the death of one woman,

Lady Claire.

All right, that's enough
of the academics for today.

Go get your hands dirty.

Hi, Chris.

Hey, Dad. l got Marek's clippers.

Oh, Chris, great. Thanks.
Here, hold that, will you.

You can move it around if you like.

l thought this would be a routine trip.
lt is.

Last time you cut off your beard,
you sold the house

and we moved to Kentucky
for a year.

Your mother wanted a change.
How does this always happen to me?

l am older and very much wiser
than you. Have a beer.

lt'll cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.

l know something's going on.

The beard's coming off,
so what's really happening?

lt's these amazing finds
we've been making.

Doniger's been giving us
too many tips.

He's a lucky zillionaire.
Nobody's that lucky.

He knows something he's not saying.
Something isn't right about this.

He's been ducking me.
l'm gonna get a few answers.

Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.

Put that in my bag, would you?
And don't wrinkle it.

l'd appreciate it
if you don't tell anybody about this.

Especially Kate.

Why would l tell Kate?
Here.

Have a wee run round that,
would you? ''Why would l tell Kate?''

You see me twice a year,
stay until you're bored to distraction.

l think the record's three weeks.

Maybe l'm just really beginning
to enjoy archeology.

From a boy who hated Easter
because he had to find eggs.

Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
That's beside the point.

Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
That's beside the point.

You're still here because of Kate.

Chris.

Look, son,

l love you,
but you're scorching my shirt.

Sorry.

You and Kate
are from different worlds.

You saw how that turned out
between your mother and me.

Yeah, but, Dad, no offense,
l'm not like you.

But Kate is.

Trust me, if it's between
archeology and you,

you'll lose.

Sorry.
l'm sorry.

l brought you a beer.

That's so sweet.
Half a beer anyways.

Half a beer.

What you got going on here?
The stairs.

The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?

Now they don't go anywhere,
but they'll lead me to my tunnel

which will go
all the way to La Roque.

What do you say l help you out?
Show me what to do.

l thought you hated this stuff.
No, l don't hate it.

Let's have a beer. l need a break.

You have the full one.
That's sweet of you.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Think you'll follow
in your father's footsteps?

No.
No.

No way. Actually, l'm not really
all that interested in the past.

No? What are you interested in then?

l think l already know
the answer to that question.

l've been hoping that you'd notice.

l've been hoping you'd quit hoping
l'd notice.

So there's nothing there?

Chris, you are the boss' son.
So...

there is something there.

lt's late. l'll just start on this tomorrow.
But thanks for the beer.

Haven't been practicing, have you?
l'm not getting any younger.

You love this stuff.
lt's a habit l can't quite kick.

Let me take that from you before
you cut something you'll need later.

So talking about love,

how did it go last night?
lt didn't.

So how does it feel being passed over
for 600-year-old ruins?

lt sucks.

lt sucks big time.

l don't understand you guys.
You live in the past.

You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.

The past is what l've been force-fed
since l was little.

None of you archeologists
looks to the future.

What are you talking about? What is
the future but just more of the same?

More gadgets, more machines
like that thing you rode up on.

lt's the past is where it's at,
you know.

People then,
they cared about each other.

Men had honor, you know?
No, no.

You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.

Romantic?

You want to see romantic?
Follow me.

Come on.

Come on!

What have you got?

Oh, another stone
sticking out of the ground.

No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus
with a French knight and his lady.

Look, isn't she beautiful?
She's a real knockout.

Very funny. Another thing,
down here, they're holding hands.

lncredibly unusual for that period.
That is kind of unusual, huh?

Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.

What happened there?

What, one ear?
That piece is missing.

lt's somewhere here in the dirt.

l'm the archeologist.
lt was carved that way.

Fair enough.
Trust me.

Who do you think they were?

Why would somebody that doesn't
give a shit be concerned with that?

Because l'm intrigued, all right?
See?

What you wanted to hear?
Yeah.

We're all intrigued by this.
That's why we're all here.

lt's not just about the rocks
and the rubble.

lt's about these people.

Who were they?
And what were their stories?

lt helps us to understand where we
came from, or where we're going.

You know what l like to say.
''You make your own history.''

Do l say it that often?
Yeah, all the time.

Well, whoever they were,

they made theirs

together.

lt's best to go really, really slow.
lt's better to be cautious.

Come on. Hurry up!

{Y:i}Cave-in at the monastery!
Cave-in at the monastery!

l was standing and the floor gave way
underneath my feet.

How long has it been open?
15 minutes.

We have five minutes
before oxygen contamination.

Let's move it.
Be careful.

lt's under where l was working.
l don't know about this.

Can everybody listen up?
Let's be careful, we got that?

l've got your back. Be safe.

Who's going in first?
OK, let's go.

Who's going down first?
l am.

On belay! On Kate!
OK, take me down nice and slow.

Give me a radio check.
Please be careful.

{Y:i}- OK, one-two. Do you read me?
We're good.

That's good.
Just keep it steady.

Lower Kate down.
Lower me down.

Easy, guys.

Nice and slow.

Nice and slow.
l'm getting close to the first level.

Easy!
Bring me down, guys.

A little more on Marek.
Smell the stale air.

Kate, be careful down there.

l'm down. Oh, my God. This is
right below where l was working.

Are you all right?
What's going on?

''All right?'' ''All right'' is not the word.

One...
Give me slack on the rope.

More slack!
Come on, guys.

Oh, my God.
This is unbelievable.

We are the first people in this room
for 600 years.

These...

These...

...are beautiful.

You won't believe the condition
of these...

What have you got?
Come here.

No way. This is too much.
Oh, my God.

What is it?
Oh, my God.

An old document box.

We've got an oilskin
with documents inside.

Look at the condition of this thing!
OK, let's be really careful.

Quick, get the bag.

l can't believe this.
That is gonna be such a find.

Careful, careful, careful.

Let's get this up.
l need the light for a minute.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, man!
Give me the light.

What kind of...
lt's amazing.

...son of a bitch would deliberately
damage something so beautiful?

Obviously not an archeologist.

We've gotta get out of here.
Let's go!

Guys, we're coming up!

Pull it up! Come on!

We want to go up quick, OK?

Hold this.
What are you doing, Marek?

lt's OK.
What are you doing?

lt's definitely a modern-day
bifocal lens.

l know. And bifocals weren't invented
until the mid-1 700s.

The hole only opened up
today, Stern.

There's been nobody down
that chamber before Kate and l.

lf you think that's weird,
you'll love this.

What is this?
One of the documents you found.

lt's just a simple list of the things
stored in there. Nothing special.

And then we found this. Look.

The professor?

''Help me''?
''E.A. Johnston''?

''4/2/1357''?
1357.

E.A. Johnston.
What is going on?

l cross-matched the signatures.
lt's definitely his handwriting.

But he's only been gone for two days.

Your father wrote that,
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

What's going on here?

Francois is looking for his spare pair.
l'll see if the prescriptions match.

So you're telling me this is the
professor's and it's 600 years old?

What have you been smoking?
Maybe you can explain.

lf l knew, l'd explain it. All l know
is that the ink is 600 years old.

l know. This is my father.
This is him.

He's just playing a prank.
No! No, there is no way

he would risk contaminating the site
as a joke. He just wouldn't.

Did you carbon-date the ink?
Of course.

There's got to be another reason.
l did it three times.

Like l just said,

your father wrote that note,

but he wrote it 600 years ago.

l don't care about lTC's policies.
l'm his son, l wanna talk to him now.

l found the professor's glasses.
They were on his desk.

lt's a perfect match. Look.

We should do an optical test
to make sure.

l'm sick of this. Either somebody
tell me where Professor Johnston is

or l report a kidnapping
to the authorities.

Have l made myself clear?

Just tell us when and where.

What is it?

Doniger's sending a plane for us.

We're going to New Mexico?

Let's pack up, guys.

Good morning.

Steven Kramer, lTC.
Frank Gordon, security.

Where's my dad?
You'll see your dad shortly.

Where's Doniger at?
Doniger's waiting inside.

Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
Tell me.

How come we have
a 600-year-old document

with his handwriting?
Pleading for help.

l'll explain as soon
as we get through security.

lTC is constantly advancing itself
in science.

30 years ago, the business world
was revolutionized with a machine

that sent documents anywhere
with the push of a button.

Doniger's vision was to do that
with 3-D objects.

Like a fax or something?
Exactly.

He's trying to send actual objects
from one place to another?

Follow me.
But that's impossible.

He would need a quantum computer
with millions of processors.

We used them to build a machine that
could fax three-dimensional objects.

l'll explain these mirrors later. lt would
put FedEx and UPS out of business.

You actually made it work?
Yes.

Across a room.

But we wanted to send things
across continents

so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.

The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...

Exactly.
...is the real thing?

We gave it a thousand times
more power.

We tried to send something
from New Mexico

to a twin machine at a lab
in New York City.

Now, here's the interesting part.

The package never arrived
at its destination.

A few hours later,
it showed up back here.

Wait a minute. So if it went missing
between New Mexico and New York,

where did it go in the meantime?
We asked the same question.

So we sent out a camera
over and over,

and we got back photos of the
same location, a hillside with trees.

That's when Mr. Doniger
made the brilliant decision

to point the camera straight up.

So once we cross-referenced
star charts to the horizon,

we realized that the camera
was not only in the wrong place,

but it was in the wrong time.
So, what does that mean?

The camera was taking photographs
of a wilderness

near Castlegard, France
in the year 1357.

So you're saying you accidentally
discovered time travel?

No, we accidentally discovered
a wormhole.

A wormhole that seems to be locked
to a single time and place in the past:

1357, Castlegard.

So you faxed my father's glasses and
documents back to the 1 4th century?

No, Chris.

Your father is in the 1 4th century.

What?

We need you to help get him back.
Mr. Robert Doniger,

this doesn't make sense.

A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can't send a person through one.

Can't fit a piece of paper
through a telephone wire.

But you can send a fax.

Sure, once you've broken the message
into a stream of electrons, but...

Oh, shit.
Now, look,

l don't care
about the hows or the whys.

l care about my father.
Did he know about all this?

l thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

l thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

about the best excavation areas,
and he could discover

why we're locked
into this particular place and time.

So this is why you've been
funding our dig.

He was more astute than l thought.
We gave him too many clues

and he became very, very suspicious.

How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...

Oh, he's a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.

Now he's stuck.
That's where you all come in.

Do we look like
wormhole specialists?

You sent the professor
to the Hundred Years' War?

Right.
Turbulent times you sent him to.

We need cultural experts,
not scientists.

My people don't know
about the medieval world

or how to mingle,
which is what we have to do

if we are to find the professor
and bring him back.

So we bring him back,
it's that simple.

We step on that machine and whiz
back to 1357 to get him back?

Once he's broken us
into a stream of electrons.

Why should we do what you ask us?
l think we need to know more...

l know you have a lot of questions...
A lot of questions.

The professor's already been gone
for 72 hours

and every minute he's there,
it'll be more difficult to find him.

That's true.
Bob?

Excuse me. l need to get them
changed if they're going to go.

Frank, change with them.
l'm not going.

Gomez and Baretto are ready.
We need to think...

l'd like you along.
We didn't say we were going.

Steve, can you bring them
to prep, please.

Sure. Folks, this way.

Thank you. Please, this way.
Thank you.

Just follow Steve.
He'll take you to the prep room.

Bob, look, Gomez and Baretto
are my two best men.

They can handle any situation.
l would prefer not going.

l really want you to go.

And if you see Decker,
you know what to do.

Robert...

You know, that was a really
great speech you made.

l almost believed it myself.

Didn't you forget something?
What?

Come on. Look at Taub's MRls.
Look at his arteries.

This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.

They deserve to know that we don't
know how he ended up in the desert.

You don't think they deserve
to know that?

l've told them enough.

How did my father get stuck
back there?

Doniger gave him an hour.

Things got harried,
and l lost him in the woods.

You left him there.
We have a limited time.

l had to come back
or we'd both be stuck.

l guess it's better him
than you, right?

Listen, there's a few things
we have to go over before we leave.

They need your vital data.
lt's for your return process.

Change from your clothes
into those clothes over there.

Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.

l want to introduce you to two friends,
Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.

They're coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.

Why do we need Marines?
Just in case something goes wrong.

l like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let's change up.

l can't believe you're considering this.
Do you understand what it does?

lt strips you down
to a molecular level,

which means, for a moment,
you cease to exist.

Listen to him, he's got a point.
Hold on! Wait a second.

l don't need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.

l need you. You know the layout.
Nobody knows it like l do.

l go.
There's no way l'm not going.

l just said l'm not going,
so don't touch me!

Thanks.

Stern, we don't need you back there.
You're a physicist.

Your knowledge won't help us.
l'm sorry.

But we are going to need you,
Francois.

Why do we need him?
Because he speaks French fluently.

He's right.
My high-school French sucks.

Don't do this.
We need his help.

l'll cover you.
Don't pressure him.

Francois, you have to make
your own decision on this.

Your father would've done it for me,
so, yes, l'll come.

OK.
Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Magnetic coils ready.
Verifying now.

Platform up.

Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.

Tell Gordon we've got to get going.

Keep a couple of beers
cold for me, all right?

Mr. Stern.

Watch our backs, OK?

lt will be all right.
We'll be back before you know it.

Take it easy, bro.
You know the 50 bucks l owe you?

All right, let's move it.

Frank, six hours
and the clock is running.

Wear these personal markers
around your neck.

You can use any one of them
to call for your return.

Frank will explain their intricacies
once you arrive.

Most importantly, one marker
will bring all of you back.

Do not lose them.
What about weapons?

Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.

They're set for a six-hour countdown.
Countdown?

They burn out after six hours.
And then?

l'll get you back before you know it.

Oh.

Sorry, Francois,
they didn't have these back then.

l don't see without...

You'll be fine. That's where
we goofed with the professor.

l feel morally compelled to inform you
that there is a degree of pain.

l'm told it's rather intense,
but extremely fleeting.

A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.

So forgive me, l didn't want that
to influence your decision.

OK. Good luck.
Let's do it.

You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.

Good luck.

Don't worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.

Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
A fantastic thing for an archeologist.

l can't believe we're doing this.
Slowly. There are no railings.

Josh, come on down. Come watch.

Josh, come on down. Come watch.

Yeah, l'm fine.
Take a place around the perimeter.

Spread out.
Move around the platform.

Take a deep breath, relax.
We'll be back before you know it.

Are we set?
All systems check.

Come in, Josh. Close the door.

Good luck.
Six hours and counting.

Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek,
l need you to take your position.

How's everybody doing?

What the hell are we doing?
Getting the chance of a lifetime.

Nothing to worry about.
We'll take care of you.

Just relax. Everything will be fine.

DNA streams locked in.
Thank you.

OK, lock them in.
Locking in.

How long does it take?
A couple of seconds.

Watch it here.

Mirrors locked.

Son of a...

Where is he? Francois!

Are you all right?
Where's Francois? Francois?

There he is!
Francois!

Pull him out!

Now we wait.

Give me your hand!

Come on!
Francois, hold on! Hold on!

Hold on!

Here, take my hand.
You all right?

You all right?
Everybody all right?

That was a close one.
All right.

Let's head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.

Hell of a start.
We've always arrived on land.

Gordon, is this it?
l think so.

You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?

This could be Oregon.
Gordon, where are we?

Shut up!
Trust me, we're in 1357 France.

Well, if this is France, l'm home.
Come on, let's go.

Let me explain the markers. Press
here, it shows the remaining time.

Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don't.

Why?
We haven't found his dad yet.

One last thing...

He said, ''Hide''. Everyone hide.
All right, take cover.

Let's go! Move! Now!

Francois, come on!

Well done, Sir De Kere.

After him.
Yes, my lord.

Get the others.
Find out who they are.

Come on, quick.

Oh, God! Baretto!

We got a field buck!
They're coming back!

Oh, my God.
Get a medic!

Get a medic up here!

What was that? What was that?
What?

What is that?

That's a grenade! Get down!

Oh, my God, he's left.

Get down! He'll see you!

You! Over here!

Let's go. Come on, come on!

All right, let's go.

Come on. Chris!

Kate!

Marek! Hey.

Where's my boys? Where's Marek?
The guys came after Baretto.

He took some arrows and then
he pressed his marker. He's gone.

He took two arrows,
and he must have hit his marker.

Where's Gomez?
l didn't see him.

Oh, my God.

Don't look.

What are you doing?
Oh, shit. l can't find his marker.

You're looking for his marker?
He's dead!

What are you doing?
l'm getting us out of here.

We're not going anywhere.
We can't save anyone if we're dead!

Keep it quiet.
You can't do that.

Why not?!

You need 40 feet of clearance
around all sides to work.

What?
l was trying to tell you.

Don't lose these. They're precious.

And if you follow my lead, l will
get your dad and get you home.

Francois, it's going to be OK.
Let's find Marek.

What about Gomez?
We can't do anything about him now.

We gotta go. Look at me.
Francois, come on.

Be quiet! The soldiers!

You passed us. You passed us
in the woods. lt's OK. lt's OK.

We've lost the trail.
Damn it.

Pick it up again.
Yes, Sir De Kere.

Search down by the river.

Jesus, you're a girl.

lt's OK.

After the French bastards!

After them! Leave none living!

Careful.

There you are.
No.

Help! Help!

Shut it off!

He knew not to take
anything modern.

That son of a bitch brought
a grenade back with him.

l can't believe it.

The coils. The coils.

Damn it! He knew the regulations,
no modern weapons!

Gomez?
The lines are online!

Well...
His marker.

What happened to the rest of them?
Get a medic over here!

l don't know.
Give me your gloves.

Well, did anyone try
to come back with him?

l don't know. l know as much
as you, OK? Hang on.

What if they're trying
to come back now?

lt's not gonna happen...
Don't jump to conclusions.

You can't leave seven people
stuck back there!

Tell me you have a backup plan...
Shut up!

l don't know. l don't know.

Please tell me you
have a backup plan.

Yes, we have a backup plan.

Go!

Gordon! Gordon! lt's Marek! Chris!

This Frenchwoman
will lead us to Castlegard.

Great. That's great.
Let's go. Come on.

Wow. The village of Castlegard.
We're here.

Where is everyone going?

Hold on a second.

What day is this?
Marek...

lt's the fourth of April.

Of course it is. lt's April 4th.
1357.

The day La Roque falls?
Wait, wait.

What are you talking about?
You son of a bitch.

Excuse me?
You brought us back

on the day the French attack.

By tonight, this whole place
is gonna be burned to the ground.

Stop with the history
and look for the professor.

Now, follow me.

Let's go.

l'm a physicist. Give me
something to do. l can help.

Might as well be a pharmacist.
Good one, Robert.

Replacement panels are on their way.
How long will this take?

Five hours and 27 minutes.

How do you know it's gonna
take 5 hours and 27 minutes?

Because that's all the time we have.

Once this platform is fixed,

even if the markers run out, we can
send someone back to get them?

The thing holding the wormhole open
is their markers.

But you've opened and closed
it dozens of times.

Once the platform...
Look, we don't even know

what we did to link us
to this wormhole.

A lucky calibration, chance impurity
in the coils. The point is, the grenade

probably destroyed any possibility
of re-creating it.

Once their markers expire,
they could be stuck there forever?

ls that what you're saying?
They could be.

Guys, come on. Come on, come on.

Come on. Come on.
Come on, this way.

Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.

The manor house.
Look at that.

l can't believe it.
We were just working on it.

That's Castlegard, all right.

lt's different.
That right section, l had wrong.

Where did that tower come from?
What if my Dad's in there?

Yeah, you're right.
How are we gonna get in?

Guys, soldiers coming.

You there!
Come on.

Why aren't you packing up?

Run! Run!
Halt! Stop!

Go, go, go, go!
Don't let them get away!

Get that horse out of the way!

My lord!

Pick him up.
Come on, my friend.

Who are they?
We captured them in the village.

l am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?

l do, my lord.
You speak strangely.

Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.

Scottish? You've come
to kill us all in our beds?

First the old man
and now this group.

Why do the Scottish
find this village so pleasing?

lt must be your lord's kind manners.
lndeed it must.

My lady.

l beg your pardon, my lord.
Let him speak.

My lord, the old man you spoke of...
Edward De Johnness?

He claims he's a magister.

Do you know of him?
He's our master, sir.

All is well with him?
He said he was alone.

We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.

Who are you?

Yes, you. The one whose head
is touching the ceiling.

Francois, my lord.

A Frenchman.

Hold. Please. Please.
We're all gentlemen here.

He's our interpreter, sir.

Forgive them. l'm at war with the
French, as well as the Scottish.

Have l forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am l at war with them?

Arnaut has sent many spies
into my midst.

No, he's not a spy.
No?

He's our friend.
l'm sure he is.

He's too tall to be a spy, anyway.

lnterpret.
Be quiet.

lnterpret.

l'm a spy.
l'm sorry, l didn't quite catch that.

lt means...
Be quiet, Francois.

...l am a spy.

My God, it's a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.

Did you hear that?
No.

Louder, boy! Come on!

l am a spy.

l thought so.

Oh, my God!
Get rid of the Frenchman.

Put them with the old man.
We may need them.

Who's next?

No!
No, Chris!

Don't! Don't!

Oh, Francois. Francois.

lnside!

Up! Move it! Move it!
No! Don't push me!

Hey, leave her alone!
Move it, ease on!

All right, you bloody Scottish!
Hold on!

l'm moving!

Over here, Andre.
This way. Come on.

My marker. Guys, l lost my marker!

Don't worry, we only need one marker
to get home, OK?

This can't be happening.
Careful with the rest.

Those bastards killed Francois.

Professor.

Professor!

Kate?
Yeah.

Kate. Oh, my God, Kate.
Are you all right?

Oh, my God. You got my message.

Chris, your dad.

Chris is here and Marek's here.
Dad?

Son.
Dad.

Chris, my son.
Glad you're still alive.

Oh, God.

What happened?

You've lost such blood.
lt's not my blood.

lt's Francois'.

He's dead.

Oliver had him killed
because he's French.

This guy had a sword
and he just ran him through.

Professor, what happened?

l was trying to avoid the English,
but they found me in the monastery.

l convinced Oliver l was a magister
on my way to Dublin.

l skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?

lt's a scientist.
He accused me of being a spy.

How did you survive that?
l promised Oliver a new weapon.

What kind of weapon?

A liquid fire so intense
that even water couldn't harm it.

Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?

Professor, l'm sorry, have you
considered what you may have done?

You've given the English
a serious advantage in this battle.

They're supposed to lose the war!
l was alone!

Marek, Marek!
l'm sorry, l'm sorry. You're right.

The point is,
when these guys come here,

and take us up to La Roque,
when they seal that place off for battle,

there is no escape.
We're as good as dead.

No, we gotta get out of here now.
Wait, wait, wait.

Remember that field
where the peasant huts were?

That's the closest place
with enough room to use the marker.

How do we get there?
We have to do it fast.

We've got four hours.
Four hours is plenty.

The way l see it, we've got 650 years
of knowledge on these guys.

There's no reason why we shouldn't
be able to get home in 20 minutes.

OK, let's find a way out.
Let's look around.

There's a hole here
big enough to climb through.

Quiet!
OK, all right.

She was with the group
we caught earlier, my lord.

May l ask why
you're trespassing on my land?

Come, come.

What are you doing?
Here's what l'll do:

l'm gonna scale down the wall. When
it's clear, l'm gonna let you guys out.

All right.
You're not going anywhere.

What? l am, l'm...

Marek, l'm the best climber.
l am the best climber.

lf anyone should
be going, it should be me,

but those roof slats won't
hold me, or you, or you, Chris.

No, no...
Wait. Wait.

But they might hold you, Kate.

Now, Kate, this isn't a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?

l'll do what l have to do.

There's no way.
You're not going anywhere.

lt's going to be all right, OK?

There's one thing worse than
dying here, and that's living here.

l refuse to do either.
l'm going. lt's OK.

She's right.

Kate.

Please, please take care.
Hey, it's easy. lt's gonna be easy.

Chris, l need your help. Come on.

l need you to hold that back
and keep it open.

All right?

Kate, be careful.
OK, here l go.

Easy.
There's guards there.

l'm gonna go up and over.

There's a window on the side.
OK, watch yourself.

l got you! l got you! Hold on!

Hold on. l got you. Don't let go.

Are you OK?
l've got a foothold.

We're gonna pull you back in.
No, l'm good.

OK, please be careful.
l've got to keep going.

You, man! Gather those children
and move!

All clear on the outside.

Hold your line, men! ln position!

Too much ale.
We'll play again when l get back.

Keep them quiet.

What the...?
Now!

Grab a weapon!

Let's go. Chris!
Very sorry.

We're heading out the way
we came in, all right? Marek?

Marek!
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead.

l'll take the rear.
All right, let's go!

Kate, we gotta go.

Oh, be careful!

Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

Quiet.

You guys go ahead.
l'll catch up with you.

What are you doing?
Listen.

Are you crazy?
Let's go.

l got my marker, l'll catch up.
Come on.

Where is he?
He'll catch up. He's got his marker.

Robert!
Yeah?

DNA streaming should
be online...now.

Got it!
Fully functioning?

Yeah!
lt's a start.

Don't move. Don't say a word.
Traitor!

Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me?

Shit!

For God's... Jesus!
Scotsman! Stop, it's me!

Stop!

What? What are you saying?

Ax! Give me the ax!

And help me watch for the wall!

Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!

Help me!
Get out of the way, woman!

Get out of the way!

Please! Come on!
There we go!

Go!

Guards!

Who is that guy?
His name is De Kere.

Come on. Quick,
let's head back to the river.

Get more guards!

We're not going without Marek.
l don't give a shit about Marek.

My job was to get the professor.
l can't take care of you.

l lost Gomez, Baretto. You guys are
on your own. Or follow me. Let's go!

To the river, quick.

We have a field buck.
Somebody's trying to come back.

How strong?
lt's minimal.

What does that mean?
lt means they're still alive.

Halt!

Come on. Come on.

Where is he? Where's Gordon?

Where's...?

There he is. There he is.
l saw him. Come on!

Wait. Watch it.
Chris! Drop your weapon.

OK. Go.

Oh, shit.

Come on!
Gonna leave us like you left my dad?
