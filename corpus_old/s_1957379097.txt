 - OH, HOW LOVELY.
 A FAMILY OCCASION TO DREAD. 

 I&amp;apos;M NOT GOING. 

 - OH, YEAH, WHAT,
 ARE YOU GOING TO PLAN 

 TO HAVE CHICKENPOX THAT DAY? 

 THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT YOU SAID
 LAST YEAR. 

 A PERSON CAN ONLY
 HAVE CHICKENPOX
 ONCE IN THEIR LIFE 

 AND TRUST ME,
 YOU HAVE HAD IT. 

 HOW LONG YOU GONNA
 KEEP MAKING THINGS UP? 

 - UNTIL DAD APOLOGIZES.
 UNTIL HIS FUNERAL.
 THAT I&amp;apos;LL GO TO. 

 LOOK, I&amp;apos;M--
 I&amp;apos;M REALLY SWAMPED 

 AND I&amp;apos;LL TALK
 TO YOU LATER. OK? BYE.

 [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] 

 [BELL OVER DOOR JINGLES] 

 HI. 

 UM, FUNNY, I JUST
 GOT OFF THE PHONE 

 WITH FRANCESCA. 

 - OH, DADDY&amp;apos;S PARTY? 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T GET IT.
 IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE
 AN ANNUAL EVENT NOW? 

 - WELL, FRANNY WANTS TO. 

 YOU KNOW, SINCE MOM DIED. 

 ANYWAY, IT&amp;apos;S A CHANCE
 TO SEE EVERYBODY. 

 - WHO? 

 ALL THE OLD PAISANS
 STUFFING THEMSELVES
 ON MANICOTTI 

 AND TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL GAMES
 THEY SAW IN 1948? 

 - WE&amp;apos;LL BE THERE. 

 - OH, SORRY. I KNOW.
 I JUST... 

 YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. 

 - LOOK, JUST MAKE AN APPEARANCE. 

 THEN YOU AND PHILIP
 CAN HAVE SOME FUNCTION
 YOU HAVE TO GO TO. 

 ANYWAY, HERE ARE THE THINGS
 I TOLD YOU ABOUT. 

 UM, I KNOW THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT
 WHAT YOU USUALLY CARRY, BUT-- 

 - WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW. 

 - GREAT. [CHUCKLES] 

 I WON&amp;apos;T KEEP YOU. 

 OH, CYNTHIA&amp;apos;S COMING DOWN
 FOR THE PARTY, TOO-- 

 - OK, OK. SAY NO MORE. 

 HI. 

 - YEAH. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE JUST LOOKING. 

 YOU GOT ANY FATIGUES
 OR COMBAT BOOTS? 

 - NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.
 I SELL VINTAGE CLOTHES. 

 [TELEPHONE RINGS] 

 SECOND TIME AROUND. 

 - HI, IT&amp;apos;S ME.
 - HI. 

 UH, PLEASE...
 BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. 

 IT&amp;apos;S REALLY FRAGILE. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S PHILIP. 

 - I KNOW. I JUST-- 

 I HAVE, UH, CUSTOMERS. 

 - OH. GREAT.
 SORRY. SORRY
 TO BOTHER YOU. 

 UH, TONIGHT DON&amp;apos;T--
 DON&amp;apos;T BOTHER TO COOK, OK? 

 I&amp;apos;LL PICK SOMETHING
 UP ON THE WAY. 

 I&amp;apos;LL BE THERE AROUND 7:00.
 - OK. 

 ALL RIGHT. WELL,
 I&amp;apos;LL SEE YOU THEN. 

 BYE.
 - BYE. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S AN ORIGINAL. 

 IT&amp;apos;S NICE, ISN&amp;apos;T IT? 

 - BE A COOL VEST.
 JUST CUT OFF THE SLEEVES. 

 - YEAH.
 - YOU CAN&amp;apos;T. 

 I MEAN, BECAUSE IT GOES
 WITH THE SKIRT, 

 AND IT&amp;apos;S NOT FOR SALE
 AS A SEPARATE. 

 - LET&amp;apos;S GO. 

 - [GIGGLES] 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 [SHOW THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 

 - LILLIAN, DARLING, 

 YOU STILL NEED TIME TO RECOVER. 

 AND I&amp;apos;VE BEEN THINKING... 

 WHY DON&amp;apos;T WE CANCEL
 THE PARTY THIS WEEKEND 

 AND GO AWAY SOMEWHERE, 

 JUST THE TWO OF US. 

 - HOW ABOUT THAT CABIN
 IN THE MOUNTAIN 

 WHERE SHE&amp;apos;S PLANNING
 TO THROW YOU OFF A CLIFF? 

 - PERHAPS THE CABIN
 IN THE MOUNTAINS. 

 YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S BEAUTIFUL THERE
 THIS TIME OF YEAR. 

 - [CHILDREN PLAYING]
 AND LAUGHING] 

 - LEAVE ON FRIDAY?
 HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY DO THAT? 

 - JUST GET ON A PLANE AND GO. 

 - JUST TO AVOID A PARTY? 

 - PEOPLE DO IT ALL THE TIME, 

 GO TO PARIS FOR THE WEEKEND. 

 - HEH.
 - COME ON. WOULDN&amp;apos;T
 IT BE GREAT? 

 JUST TAKE OFF.
 GET AWAY FROM ALL OF THEM. 

 NO ARGUMENTS, NO BICKERING. 

 WELL, YOU DON&amp;apos;T LIKE
 MY FAMILY, ANYWAY. 

 - I DO.
 I LIKE YOUR FAMILY. 

 I DO LIKE THEM. 

 THEY&amp;apos;RE NOISY WHEN THEY EAT,
 BUT I LIKE THEM. 

 EXCUSE ME.
 EXCUSE ME. 

 - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 

 WE COULD GO SOMEPLACE QUIET, 

 SOMEPLACE NICE,
 JUST THE TWO OF US. 

 - UM, WHEN IS IT AGAIN,
 THE PARTY? 

 - DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO? 

 - YES, WE HAVE TO GO.
 IT&amp;apos;S YOUR FAMILY. 

 WHEN IS IT AGAIN? 

 - SATURDAY. 

 COME ON. 

 JUST HUMOR ME.
 JUST TELL ME 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE GONNA TAKE ME
 AWAY SOMEDAY, SOMEWHERE. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO MEAN IT.
 JUST SAY IT. 

 JUST...SAY IT. 

 - WHAT? 

 - NEVER MIND. 

 KNOCK, KNOCK. 

 - AH, CATE.
 COME IN. COME IN. 

 - HELLO. LOOK AT YOU. 

 - HOW ARE YOU? 

 - GOOD. AND YOU? 

 - MMM. AH, LOOK,
 I&amp;apos;M ALL DIRTY. 

 HERE, TAKE THAT. 

 - OH, BEAUTIFUL.
 - COME ON. 

 - THANKS. 

 - I HAVE A LITTLE
 SURPRISE FOR YOU. 

 CATS. 

 - OHH, WILLIE,
 THESE ARE FABULOUS. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S A GOOD ONE. 

 - WHERE DID YOU GET THEM? 

 - HERE AND THERE.
 YOU KNOW. 

 - COME ON.
 YOU DON&amp;apos;T FIND 

 THIS KIND OF QUALITY
 AT GARAGE SALES. 

 - NO, YOU DON&amp;apos;T. 

 - COME ON. 

 - OH, ALL RIGHT, I&amp;apos;LL TELL YOU. 

 SEEING AS I&amp;apos;VE SOLD YOU MY SHOP, 

 I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE YOU
 MY LAST LITTLE SECRET, YES? 

 YOU READY? 

 HERE! 

 THERE YOU ARE.
 FUNERALS. 

 - HUH?
 - YEP. 

 - THE OBITUARIES?
 - THE OBITUARIES. 

 GOT IT IN ONE. 

 AND, YOU KNOW... 

 THE FAMILY&amp;apos;S USUALLY VERY GLAD
 TO HAVE SOMEBODY AROUND, 

 TO HELP OUT, YOU KNOW,
 TO DISPOSE OF THINGS. 

 OF COURSE I SPLIT THE PROCEEDS
 WITH THEM IF THEY SELL. 

 WICKED, EH? 

 - NO. IT&amp;apos;S A SERVICE, REALLY. 

 - YES. IT&amp;apos;S A SERVICE
 TO THEM AND TO YOU. 

 - WELL, THE "IF THEY SELL"
 PART ISN&amp;apos;T SO PERFECT. 

 - NO, IT&amp;apos;S THE FUN, CATE. 

 COME ON, LET&amp;apos;S FACE IT.
 IT&amp;apos;S THE FUN. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE SITTING HERE
 WITH A BUNDLE OF OLD CLOTHES, 

 AND YOU&amp;apos;RE RUMMAGING
 THROUGH THEM,
 AND WHAT DO YOU FIND? 

 A GENUINE GIVENCHY. 

 I MEAN, THAT&amp;apos;S WONDERFUL. 

 I MEAN, LOOK AT...
 LOOK AT THIS GREEN DRESS. 

 WOULDN&amp;apos;T THAT BE JUST
 WONDERFUL FOR YOUR MOTHER? 

 THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD 

 WHO COULD WEAR
 EVERY COLOR OF GREEN
 BECAUSE OF HER HAIR. 

 LISTEN TO THAT.
 CHA CHA CHA! 

 - OH, CYNTHIA&amp;apos;LL LOVE IT. 

 - OH, CYNTHIA, YES. 

 - I&amp;apos;LL TAKE IT FOR HER.
 - YES. 

 - I&amp;apos;D LOVE TO COME
 WITH YOU SOMETIME. 

 - WELL, YOU CAN. 

 YOU CAN COME WITH ME
 ANYTIME YOU LIKE. 

 [CLOCK CHIMING] 

 - OH, GOD. WILLIE! 

 - PIERCE!
 - PIERCE! 

 - UH, UH, UH.
 HE&amp;apos;S GOING TO LOSE
 ONE OF THOSE CUFF LINKS. 

 GO ON, GO ON, GO ON, GO ON.
 TELL ME I&amp;apos;M RIGHT. 

 - NO. CYNTHIA NEVER TELLS ME
 ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLOT. 

 - IMAGINE HAVING HIM
 FOR A BROTHER-IN-LAW. 

 - WELL, HE&amp;apos;S NOT YET. 

 - YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW HIM. 

 - OH, YEAH. 

 - SO?
 - WHAT? 

 WHAT YOU SEE
 IS WHAT YOU GET. 

 - WHAT I SEE,
 I&amp;apos;D BE THRILLED TO GET. 

 - BUT, SURINAME, YOU SAID
 SATURN IN MY EIGHTH HOUSE 

 DID NOT MEAN SIMON AND I
 WOULD ACTUALLY BREAK UP. 

 ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,
 LISTEN, MY SISTER&amp;apos;S HERE. 

 I&amp;apos;LL CALL YOU LATER. 

 OK, BYE. 

 HEY, SWEETS.
 - HI. 

 - HI. MMM. 

 - WHAT&amp;apos;S THIS ABOUT SIMON? 

 ARE YOU BREAKING UP? 

 - OH, WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT. 

 HE THINKS
 HE&amp;apos;S PIERCE COVINGTON, 

 TALKS WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT,
 CALLS ME OLIVIA. 

 HE SAYS HE CAN&amp;apos;T COMMIT. 

 AFTER I&amp;apos;VE GIVEN HIM
 2 YEARS OF MY LIFE. 

 SO I TOLD HIM
 I SHOULD BE COMMITTED
 FOR DATING HIM, 

 AND I WALKED OUT. 

 - WELL, THAT&amp;apos;S ACTORS FOR YOU. 

 - RIGHT. LIKE
 YOU&amp;apos;D KNOW FROM ACTORS. 

 HOW&amp;apos;S MR. PHIL? 

 - PHILIP? HE&amp;apos;S FINE. 

 ARE YOU HERE FOR
 DADDY&amp;apos;S PARTY ALREADY? 

 - I&amp;apos;M HERE
 TO NURSE MY WOUNDS. 

 - AW! 

 - DATING A SOAP OPERA STAR
 IS BAD ENOUGH. 

 DATING A SOAP OPERA
 CHARACTER IS LUDICROUS. 

 SO, WHAT ABOUT PHILIP? 

 IS ANYTHING HAPPENING THERE? 

 - I&amp;apos;M QUITE CONTENT, THANK YOU. 

 - QUITE CONTENT? 

 SOUNDS MADLY
 EXCITING. SNORE. 

 OH, OH, OH, OH. 

 IT&amp;apos;S NOT FOR YOU. 

 REMEMBER MOM&amp;apos;S DYING WORDS? 

 - GREEN...
 - GREEN... 

 - NOT GOOD ON YOU.
 - NOT GOOD ON YOU. 

 - I WANTED TO FIX THE SEQUINS
 BEFORE YOU SAW IT. 

 - OH, SWEETIE,
 CAN I TRY IT ON? 

 - YES. 

 I&amp;apos;M SURE YOU WANT IT SHORTER. 

 - MM-HMM. 

 [DOOR BELL JINGLES]
 OH. 

 - OH! 

 THOSE STEPS. 

 DON&amp;apos;T YOU HAVE ANYTHING NEW? 

 - UH, NO. 

 I SELL SECONDHAND
 AND CONSIGNMENT, 

 JUST LIKE THE SIGN SAYS. 

 - WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

 - OH, PRETTY. 

 MM. VERY FOXY. 

 VERY, VERY, NICE. 

 - I HATE SECONDHAND.
 I&amp;apos;VE GOT A THING ABOUT IT. 

 YOU--YOU--YOU KNOW,
 SOMEONE ELSE&amp;apos;S CLOTHES. 

 - REALLY?
 - HMM. 

 - MAYBE YOU SHOULD
 SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT THAT. 

 - OH, CUTE. 

 REAL CUTE. 

 - WHY DID YOU
 TREAT HER LIKE THAT? 

 - LIKE WHAT? 

 - AS IF SHE SMELLED. 

 - SHE WASN&amp;apos;T GONNA BUY. 

 SHE WANTED NEW STUFF. 

 - COULDN&amp;apos;T YOU HAVE SAID,
 "MY STUFF&amp;apos;S NOT NEW, 

 BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE FINEST
 IN DESIGNER WEAR"? 

 YOU COULD HAVE
 SHOWN HER SOMETHING 

 THAT WAS MORE HER STYLE
 OR AT LEAST HER SIZE. 

 - SHE DIDN&amp;apos;T
 APPRECIATE MY STUFF. 

 - WAKE UP, CATE.
 WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING HERE,
 A MUSEUM OR A STORE? 

 - I CAN&amp;apos;T FORCE PEOPLE TO BUY. 

 THEY HAVE TO WANT MY STUFF. 

 - YOU CAN ENCOURAGE THEM. 

 I MEAN, LOOK AT
 THIS PLACE. IT&amp;apos;S DRAB. 

 I-I&amp;apos;M SORRY, BUT IT IS. 

 IT SHOULD BE ROMANTIC AND FUN. 

 SLAP SOME PAINT ON THE WALLS. 

 BRIGHTEN IT UP. 

 OH, HERE.
 NICER BAGS WOULD HELP. 

 AND DOORS ON THE DRESSING ROOMS. 

 THESE CURTAINS ARE GHASTLY. 

 AND FULL-LENGTH MIRRORS INSIDE. 

 - CYNTHIA, STOP.
 I KNOW YOUR PROJECTS. 

 IN A MINUTE,
 YOU&amp;apos;LL BE TELLING ME
 I NEED FERNS AND CUPIDS. 

 - NO FERNS,
 BUT CUPIDS MIGHT WORK. 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T HAVE ANY MONEY. 

 - OH, CATIE,
 YOU DON&amp;apos;T NEED MONEY.
 YOU HAVE ME. 

 - YOU KNOW I CAN&amp;apos;T DO THAT. 

 - SWEETIE, YOU&amp;apos;LL HAVE
 TO DO SOMETHING, 

 OR ELSE YOU&amp;apos;LL BE BACK
 WORKING AT THE PENTAGON. 

 LET&amp;apos;S JUST MAKE A LIST.
 A LIST DOESN&amp;apos;T COST ANYTHING. 

 - YEAH, I KNOW YOU--
 - PENTAGON. 

 - OK. 

 [TELEPHONE RINGS] 

 [RING] 

 HELLO. 

 - HI, CATE.
 IT&amp;apos;S ME. 

 - HI. WHERE ARE YOU? 

 - I&amp;apos;M SORRY. LISTEN,
 I CAN&amp;apos;T MAKE IT. 

 I HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEETING 

 WITH GRANT WINTHROP IN NEW YORK. 

 - NEW YORK? 

 - YES. I&amp;apos;M AT THE AIRPORT NOW.
 - AHH. 

 - SORRY.
 IT JUST CAME UP. 

 SO EXPLAIN TO YOUR FATHER
 FOR ME, OK? 

 - PHILIP, YOU&amp;apos;RE SENDING ME
 INTO BATTLE ALONE. 

 - I KNOW. I&amp;apos;M SORRY.
 I HAVE TO DO THIS, CATE. 

 - OK. 

 - OK? BYE. 

 - BYE. 

 - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] 

 [LAUGHTER] 

 - AH. SO THE BIG
 BUSINESSWOMAN ARRIVES
 AN HOUR LATE, HUH? 

 - HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD. 

 - SWAMPED WITH CUSTOMERS,
 IS THAT RIGHT? 

 - NOT EXACTLY. 

 HERE.
 IT&amp;apos;S FROM PHILIP, TOO. 

 - OH, THANKS. 

 - HE HAD AN EMERGENCY AT WORK.
 HE COULDN&amp;apos;T MAKE IT. 

 - YOU OUGHT TO MARRY THAT GUY. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW WHY
 YOU&amp;apos;RE DRAGGING YOUR FEET. 

 ANYWAY, I THINK
 THERE&amp;apos;S SOME FOOD LEFT.
 GO GET SOME. 

 - HEY. 

 - HI, CATE. 

 - SWEETS.
 - NICE DRESS. 

 - THANK YOU. 

 - DADDY LOVES YOUR CANNOLI,
 SIGNORA CORETTI.
 MOLTO GRAZIE. 

 OH, GOOD, CATE, YOU MADE IT. 

 - HI.
 - HI. 

 - HEY, WHERE&amp;apos;S PHILIP? 

 - UM, HE HAD
 AN EMERGENCY AT WORK. 

 "WE LOVE YOU MAD"? 

 - I TELEPHONED
 THE ORDER IN. 

 THEY MADE A MISTAKE.
 - [LAUGHING] 

 - HEY. HOW&amp;apos;S MY FAVORITE
 SISTER-IN-LAW? 

 - THOUGHT I WAS YOUR FAVORITE. 

 - YOU ARE. AH, YOU&amp;apos;RE ALL
 MY FAVORITE. 

 - OH, WELL, WHY DON&amp;apos;T WE JUST
 CHANGE THE "M" TO A "D"? 

 - WE COULD STICK
 AN "LY" ON THE END. 

 "WE LOVE YOU MADLY." 

 - I THINK IT&amp;apos;S PERFECT
 THE WAY IT IS. 

 HE&amp;apos;S ALWAYS MAD ABOUT SOMETHING. 

 - ANNETTE, COULD YOU
 PUT THE CANNOLI IN THE FRIDGE? 

 - SURE.
 - CATE, MAYBE YOU COULD-- 

 - GET OUT OF THE ROOM?
 I CAN DO THAT. 

 - OK, MR. ATTORNEY. 

 WHAT&amp;apos;S BLACK AND BROWN
 AND LOOKS GOOD ON LAWYERS? 

 - DOBERMAN. 

 - ALL RIGHT. WHAT&amp;apos;S
 THE LAWYER&amp;apos;S CREED? 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE INNOCENT
 UNTIL PROVEN BROKE. 

 - ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT&amp;apos;S THE DIFFERENCE 

 BETWEEN A LAWYER
 AND A CATFISH? 

 - WELL, ONE&amp;apos;S A BOTTOM-FEEDING
 SCAVENGER. 

 THE OTHER&amp;apos;S A FISH. 

 - HA HA HA!
 - HA HA HA! 

 - OH, YOU&amp;apos;RE BACK ALREADY? 

 I THOUGHT YOU WENT UPSTAIRS
 TO IRON YOUR BLOUSE. 

 HA HA HA! 

 - UM, DADDY, IF YOU KNEW
 ANYTHING ABOUT FASHION, 

 YOU&amp;apos;D KNOW HER OUTFIT
 IS VERY CHIC. 

 - BUT SHE LOOKS LIKE
 SHE&amp;apos;S SLEPT IN IT.
 WHAT&amp;apos;S CHIC ABOUT THAT? 

 - I&amp;apos;M SURE YOU THINK THAT SHIRT
 IS THE HEIGHT OF FASHION. 

 - HA HA HA!
 - HA HA HA! 

 - HEY, I DON&amp;apos;T CLAIM
 TO BE AN EXPERT. 

 AND I DON&amp;apos;T TRY TO MAKE A LIVING 

 SELLING OTHER PEOPLE&amp;apos;S
 CASTOFFS. 

 IS THAT BLOUSE AN EXAMPLE
 OF YOUR MERCHANDISE? 

 WHEW, NO WONDER. 

 - NO WONDER WHAT?
 - NO WONDER
 YOU HAVE TO COME HOME 

 TO GET A DECENT MEAL.
 LOOK AT YOU. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE THIN.
 YOU&amp;apos;RE PALE. 

 I--I--BUT I GUESS
 THAT&amp;apos;S CHIC, TOO, ISN&amp;apos;T IT? 

 - DADDY, YOU&amp;apos;RE IMPOSSIBLE. 

 - HA HA HA! 

 JUST WHAT I&amp;apos;VE ALWAYS WANTED. 

 HA HA!
 GET A LOAD OF THAT. 

 - [CROWD SINGING
 "FOR HE&amp;apos;S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW"] 

 - NEED ANY HELP? 

 - NO, THANKS. 

 OH, HI. 

 - HI. 

 - CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? 

 - OH, I&amp;apos;LL GET IT. 

 SO... 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE CATE. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S RIGHT. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE CYNTHIA&amp;apos;S-- 

 - ATTORNEY. ONE OF THEM.
 HARRY DIETRICH. 

 UH... 

 I THINK YOUR BLOUSE IS GREAT. 

 - THANK YOU. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY,
 ISN&amp;apos;T IT? 

 - YEAH. HOW&amp;apos;D YOU KNOW THAT? 

 - I THINK THAT WAS
 MY GRANDMOTHER&amp;apos;S. 

 - OH, SO,
 SHE WANT IT BACK? 

 - TOO LATE. 

 - GOOD. I WANTED
 YOU TWO TO MEET. 

 HARRY JUST MOVED HERE
 FROM NEW YORK. 

 - I&amp;apos;M GONNA GET THE CREAMER.
 IT&amp;apos;S RIGHT UP HERE. 

 - OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.
 - HOT COFFEE. 

 - SUGAR IN HERE? 

 - HEY. 

 - [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] 

 - OH, EXCUSE ME. 

 - I&amp;apos;LL GRAB SOME
 OUT OF THE DISHWASHER. 

 - NAPKINS IN THE DRAWER?
 - I&amp;apos;LL WASH THESE OUT. 

 - YEAH, I GOT THEM. 

 - I FEEL SO CLOSE TO YOU. 

 - HA HA HA! 

 FRANCESCA IS THE OLDEST, RIGHT? 

 I MET HER WHEN I ARRIVED. 

 SHE SEEMS VERY DETERMINED. 

 - OH, YES. 

 SHE&amp;apos;S AN INTERNIST, YOU KNOW. 

 VERY SUCCESSFUL.
 BUT IT TOOK DETERMINATION. 

 MORE THAN THE USUAL. 

 - OH? 

 - WELL, FIRST SHE GOT
 A SCHOLARSHIP 

 TO JOHNS HOPKINS AT 17, 

 THEN GOT PREGNANT, 

 GOT PACKED OFF TO A HOME
 FOR UNWED MOTHERS. 

 BUT AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN, 

 SHE AND JERRY REFUSED
 TO GIVE HER UP
 AND GOT MARRIED. 

 - AND THEN SHE BECAME A DOCTOR? 

 - ARE YOU SURE
 THIS ISN&amp;apos;T TOO BORING? 

 - NO. 

 - UH, DAD SAID NO SENSE
 WASTING A GOOD MIND, 

 THEN BULLIED HER
 INTO TAKING THE
 SCHOLARSHIP ANYWAY. 

 - AND ANNETTE, THE BLONDE. 

 - GREAT MOTHER, GREAT WIFE. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S HER BANKER HUSBAND
 PAUL ON THE GAZEBO. 

 THE MATCHING GIRLS ARE THEIRS.
 CHECK OUT THE CLOTHES. 

 THE WHOLE FAMILY
 IS COLOR-COORDINATED. 

 WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
 FRANNY AND ANNETTE
 WERE DAD&amp;apos;S FAVORITES, 

 TILL CYNTHIA HIT PUBERTY
 AND TURNED INTO... 

 - CYNTHIA? 

 SO THERE&amp;apos;S FRANCESCA THE DOCTOR, 

 ANNETTE THE PERFECT WIFE, 

 CYNTHIA THE SUPERMODEL, 

 AND CAITLIN... 

 THE RAG SELLER. 

 NOT EXACTLY MY FATHER&amp;apos;S
 DARLING CHILD. 

 - WELL, I THINK
 YOU&amp;apos;RE SOMETHING. 

 AND VERY BEAUTIFUL, TOO. 

 - OH. 

 - CAITLIN... 

 THANKS FOR THE GLOVES. 

 OH, HARRY, RIGHT? 

 THE BOTTOM-FEEDING SCAVENGER. 

 - THAT WOULD BE ME. 

 - [LAUGHING] 

 - MY DAD. 

 - DO YOU--DO YOU WANT
 TO GET OUT OF HERE? 

 - YEAH. 

 - WITH A BOTTOM FEEDER? 

 - YEAH.
 - ALL RIGHT. 

 [NO AUDIO] 

 - THANKS. 

 - I KNOW YOU&amp;apos;RE
 SEEING SOMEONE, 

 BUT, UH... 

 I&amp;apos;D LIKE TO CALL YOU ANYWAY. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S NOT A GOOD IDEA. 

 - I&amp;apos;M GONNA CALL YOU. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO CALL BACK. 

 - I SHOULD GO. 

 [RING] 

 [MACHINE PICKS UP] 

 [BEEP] 

 - HI. IT&amp;apos;S CATE.
 LEAVE A MESSAGE. 

 [BEEP] 

 - HI, CATE.
 IT&amp;apos;S PHILIP. 

 YOU BACK FROM THE PARTY? HELLO? 

 IF YOU&amp;apos;RE THERE, PICK UP. 

 ALL RIGHT. 

 WELL, UM, I&amp;apos;M AT THE ST. REGIS.
 YOU HAVE THE NUMBER. 

 I&amp;apos;LL BE BACK IN
 MY ROOM ABOUT 7:00. 

 CALL ME, PLEASE.
 I LOVE YOU. BYE. 

 - HE&amp;apos;S COMPLETELY SMITTEN.
 I COULD TELL. 

 - STOP PLAYING CUPID, OK?
 I DON&amp;apos;T NEED IT. 

 - YOU NEED SOME PASSION
 IN YOUR LIFE. 

 YOU THINK YOU&amp;apos;RE IN LOVE
 WITH PHILIP, 

 BUT HE&amp;apos;S JUST A HABIT. 

 MAYBE IT&amp;apos;S TIME FOR A CHANGE. 

 - SPEAKING AS SOMEONE
 WHO JUST BROKE UP 

 WITH HER OWN HABIT, 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT EXACTLY SPEAKING 

 FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. 

 HMM. 

 - MAYBE THEY&amp;apos;RE
 FROM ST. ANTHONY&amp;apos;S, 

 WHEN IT BURNED DOWN. 

 - CLEAN &amp;apos;EM UP, STRIP &amp;apos;EM, 

 PUT A DOOR FRAME AROUND &amp;apos;EM. 

 - YOU MEAN YOU LIKE THEM? 

 - THEY&amp;apos;RE BEAUTIFUL. 

 HUH? HUH? 

 - ANYWAY, YOU&amp;apos;RE HARDLY
 THE FIRST WOMAN TO DUMP A GUY 

 BECAUSE SHE FELL
 FOR SOMEONE ELSE. 

 - I&amp;apos;M NOT DUMPING ANYONE, 

 AND I HAVEN&amp;apos;T FALLEN
 FOR ANYONE. 

 I&amp;apos;M GONNA MARRY PHILIP. 

 - REALLY?
 WHERE&amp;apos;S THE RING? 

 OR DID I MISS SOMETHING? 

 - LET&amp;apos;S GO SEE MOM. 

 - [SIGHS] 

 - I HOPE HEAVEN&amp;apos;S
 A BIG COCKTAIL PARTY, 

 AND SHE&amp;apos;S THE CENTER
 OF ATTENTION IN HER RED SUIT. 

 A DRY MARTINI-- 

 - PROBABLY HER THIRD. 

 - THIS ALWAYS BUGGED ME... 

 HIS NAME THERE. 

 IT SHOULD JUST READ,
 "BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER." 

 - WELL...HE WAS HER HUSBAND, 

 AND HE LOVED HER. 

 OH, WE WERE ALWAYS SURE
 TO FIND OUR CATIE 

 UNDER THE BED
 WHENEVER THEY YELLED. 

 - WHEN HE YELLED, YOU MEAN. 

 COME ON, HE NEVER LET UP ON HER. 

 SHE SPENT HALF MY CHILDHOOD 

 IN THE GAZEBO CRYING. 

 - AND GETTING PIE-EYED. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE
 SHE STASHED HER BOTTLES. 

 - YEAH, WELL... 

 IT WAS HIS FAULT
 SHE DRANK, ANYWAY. 

 - COME ON, CATE.
 SHE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;VE NEVER SAID
 A BAD WORD ABOUT DAD. 

 - NO, I HAVEN&amp;apos;T, 

 AND I HATE IT THAT YOU DO. 

 I WISH I COULD FIND
 A MAN HALF AS GOOD. 

 - IT WASN&amp;apos;T THAT HARD FOR ME. 

 - OF COURSE
 THEY WANT TO SEE YOU. 

 - [LAUGHS] 

 - THEY ALWAYS ASK
 IF YOU&amp;apos;RE COMING
 WITH ME. THEY DO. 

 [CLOCK CHIMES] 

 - THIS POTATO SALAD...
 IS DELICIOUS. 

 UNUSUAL. 

 - A PLACE IN THE VILLAGE
 MAKES IT FRESH. 

 WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE? 

 - THANK YOU. 

 PHILIP? 

 - UH-HUH? 

 - I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. 

 - FIRE AWAY. 

 - WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ME?
 - WHAT? 

 - WHAT--
 - DOING? 

 - WHAT DO YOU SEE IN ME? 

 - [SIGHS] 

 I CAN&amp;apos;T CATEGORIZE IT. 

 - TRY. 

 - [SIGHS] ALL RIGHT. OK, UM... 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE NICE TO ME. 

 EXCUSE ME. 

 - GO ON. 

 - UH... 

 YOU MAKE ME FEEL GOOD. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT DEMANDING. 

 - DEMANDING. 

 - YOU KNOW, YOU DON&amp;apos;T--
 YOU DON&amp;apos;T... 

 BADGER ME TO GO PLACES
 AND DO THINGS 

 I DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO GO OR DO. 

 - BUT, PHILIP, THESE ARE THINGS 

 THAT DESCRIBE HOW
 I ACT TOWARDS YOU. 

 WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME
 THAT YOU LIKE? 

 MY OWN QUALITIES. 

 - I REALLY DON&amp;apos;T SEE
 WHERE THIS IS GOING. 

 I LIKE EVERYTHING. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE PERFECT. 

 DON&amp;apos;T CHANGE, OK? 

 PLEASE GET IN THE CAR. 

 [RING] 

 - REMODEL INCORPORATED.
 LET US REMODEL YOU. 

 HARRY! 

 YES, SHE&amp;apos;S HERE. 

 ISN&amp;apos;T SHE? 

 WHAT DID I TELL YOU? 

 - GIVE IT. 

 HELLO? 

 HI! 

 UH... 

 REMODELING, YEAH. 

 CYNTHIA TALKED ME INTO IT. 

 NOW? 

 OK. 

 [CHUCKLES] YEAH. 

 OK, BYE. 

 - WHAT DID HE SAY? 

 - NOTHING. 

 - NOTHING? 

 - WE&amp;apos;RE HAVING COFFEE. 

 - LISTEN, HARRY IS CHARMING,
 HANDSOME, AND SMART. 

 IT&amp;apos;S OK TO LIKE HIM. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S JUST COFFEE. 

 - WELL, THAT
 WASN&amp;apos;T ENOUGH FOR GUS, 

 SO HE BEFRIENDED THE WIDOW
 WHO LIVED ONE FLOOR BELOW US. 

 - IN THE SAME BUILDING? 

 - OH, YES. OH, YES. 

 BUT SHE HAD 2 SONS,
 EX-MARINES BOTH, 

 WHO DID NOT APPROVE OF GUS. 

 SO HE PUT ON AN OVERCOAT, 

 A HAT, A SCARF,
 A FAKE MUSTACHE-- 

 AND THIS WAS
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER-- 

 AND HE&amp;apos;D GO DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE
 TO CALL ON THE WIDOW. 

 - [LAUGHING] 

 - AND MY MOM EVENTUALLY
 TOOK HIM BACK, 

 FORGAVE HIM. 

 AND AFTER SHE DIED,
 HE WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA 

 TO DO THE RACETRACK CIRCUIT,
 WHERE HE DIED OF A CORONARY. 

 - BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
 YOU LIKED HIM. 

 - OH, YEAH. 

 WHAT A CHARACTER. 

 THERE&amp;apos;S A HITCHCOCK FESTIVAL
 THIS WEEK AT THE UPTOWN. 

 - OH, REALLY? 

 THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER
 ON THE BIG SCREEN, 

 ESPECIALLY THE
 BLACK-AND-WHITE ONES. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T GET
 THAT CONTRAST ON TV. 

 - WAS THAT A YES? 

 HOW ABOUT A RIDE? 

 - UH... 

 NO, THANKS.
 I&amp;apos;LL WALK. 

 - WELL, I&amp;apos;LL CHECK
 THE MOVIE TIMES. 

 I&amp;apos;LL GIVE YOU A CALL. 

 - WHATEVER. 

 - I&amp;apos;M SO GLAD
 YOU&amp;apos;RE DOING IT UP. 

 - YEAH?
 - IT NEEDED THAT. 

 I MISS IT. 

 - THE SHOP? 

 - YEAH, MORE THAN
 I THOUGHT I WOULD. 

 THE KIND OF--YOU KNOW,
 THE CHATTERING,
 THE TALKING TO PEOPLE. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT
 I REALLY, REALLY MISS. 

 - WELL, YOU CAN COME BACK
 ANYTIME YOU WANT, YOU KNOW. 

 - YEAH. 

 LOOK, HONESTLY,
 LOOK AT THESE WEEDS. 

 YOU&amp;apos;D THINK SOMEBODY&amp;apos;D
 GIVE THEM A WHACK. 

 OH, LOOK WHAT
 WE&amp;apos;VE GOT HERE. 

 - WHAT?
 - HE&amp;apos;S SEEN BETTER DAYS. 

 A LITTLE CUPID. 

 AH, LOOK. 

 - FUNNY, CYNTHIA AND I
 WERE JUST TALKING 

 ABOUT CUPIDS FOR THE SHOP. 

 - THERE, THERE, LOOK, SEE?
 HE&amp;apos;S SMILING. 

 DO YOU WANT HIM? 

 - WELL, HE&amp;apos;S CUTE, ISN&amp;apos;T HE? 

 - WELL, HE&amp;apos;S
 A SAUCY LITTLE CHAP. 

 [LAUGHS] 

 COME ON, LET&amp;apos;S ASK HOW MUCH
 THEY WANT FOR IT. 

 - OK. 

 - UHH!
 - IS IT HEAVY? 

 - YES. 

 ACTUALLY, I COULD HELP YOU
 WITH THE BOOKS. 

 - YES. 

 - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] 

 - FEEL LIKE CHINESE? 

 - YOU SAID A MOVIE.
 WE DID THE MOVIE. 

 YOU NEVER SAID
 A MOVIE AND DINNER. 

 - TAKEOUT IS HARDLY DINNER.
 WE WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO OUT. 

 WE COULD EAT ON YOUR BALCONY. 

 - WAIT-- 

 HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW
 I HAVE A BALCONY? 

 - ALL THE APARTMENTS
 IN YOUR BUILDING HAVE
 A BALCONY, DON&amp;apos;T THEY? 

 - OH, RIGHT. 

 - AH, THIS IS GREAT. 

 I&amp;apos;M SORRY.
 DO YOU WANT A PLATE? 

 - NO, I THOUGHT
 WE COULD EAT FAMILY STYLE 

 IF THAT&amp;apos;S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU. 

 - OH, SURE.
 THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT. 

 - MMM, FRIED RICE. 

 - IS IT GOOD?
 - GOOD. 

 WANT SOME?
 TRY IT. 

 - OK, YOU WANT
 TO TRY MINE? 

 - SURE. 

 MMM. 

 THIS IS ONE OF
 MY FAVORITES. 

 CAN I GET YOU
 SOME LONGER CHOPSTICKS? 

 - [LAUGHS] 

 I KNOW. 

 HA HA HA! 

 I KNOW, I-- 

 I HUNCH OVER MY FOOD LIKE-- 

 LIKE I&amp;apos;M AFRAID
 SOMEBODY&amp;apos;S GONNA TAKE IT. 

 I CALL IT...
 THE IMMIGRANT HUNCH. 

 MY WHOLE FAMILY DOES IT. 

 - I LIKE THAT IMMIGRANT HUNCH. 

 HMM? 

 - UH-UH. 

 - I&amp;apos;LL STICK
 WITH THE BROCCOLI. 

 - NO, I WANT IT BACK. 

 - NO. 

 - SO I TOOK THE MONEY
 MY MOTHER GAVE ME, 

 AND I QUIT MY JOB... 

 AND I OPENED THE SHOP. 

 AND I&amp;apos;M GLAD I DID. 

 EXCEPT SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK
 AT MY BANK STATEMENTS. 

 - DOING WORK YOU ENJOY
 IS WORTH EVERYTHING. 

 - SO YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO? 

 - I DO. IT&amp;apos;S MOSTLY
 SMALL-TIME STUFF, 

 BUT MY CLIENTS HAVE
 REAL PROBLEMS, 

 AND SOMETIMES I CAN HELP &amp;apos;EM. 

 YOU WERE WASHING DISHES
 THE FIRST TIME WE MET. 

 AND YOU PULLED
 YOUR HAND OUT OF THE SINK 

 STILL WET AND SOAPY
 AND SHOOK MY HAND ANYWAY. 

 I LIKED THAT. 

 - OH, YOU DID? 

 - YOU DIDN&amp;apos;T HESITATE. 

 GOOD NIGHT. 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 - CATE, IT&amp;apos;S PHILIP.
 LISTEN, WOULD YOU MEET ME 

 AT THE HAY-ADAMS
 AT 8:00 TONIGHT? 

 AND WHY DON&amp;apos;T YOU WEAR
 THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
 THAT I LIKE? BYE. 

 WELL, I&amp;apos;VE BEEN
 DOING SOME THINKING-- 

 [CLEARS THROAT]
 AND...DO YOU REMEMBER
 THE OTHER DAY 

 WHEN YOU ASKED ME
 WHAT I SAW IN YOU? 

 WELL, I THINK I KNOW
 WHAT YOU WERE ASKING, 

 AND THE THING IS THAT WE SEEM
 TO GET ALONG SO WELL 

 MOST OF THE TIME THAT--
 ALMOST ALL THE TIME-- 

 THAT, UH... 

 WE&amp;apos;VE NEVER HAD
 TO TALK ABOUT IT. 

 I MEAN, WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM, 

 DON&amp;apos;T YOU THINK? 

 - YEAH. 

 I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE "TEAM"
 IS THE RIGHT WORD. 

 - BUT YOU KNOW
 WHAT I MEAN, RIGHT? 

 I DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO LOSE YOU. 

 I WANT YOU TO STICK AROUND... 

 PERMANENTLY. 

 - I HOPE YOU&amp;apos;RE
 NOT DOING THIS 

 BECAUSE YOU&amp;apos;RE AFRAID
 I WOULD LEAVE YOU. 

 - NO! 

 NO, I&amp;apos;M DOING IT BECAUSE
 IT&amp;apos;S A--MAKES SENSE. 

 IT&amp;apos;S THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE RIGHT. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S WONDERFUL. 

 THAT IS WONDERFUL. 

 - HI. 

 - YOU KNOW,
 I&amp;apos;VE BEEN THINKING-- 

 IT&amp;apos;S NOT ENOUGH
 JUST TO DO A FACE-LIFT HERE. 

 YOU NEED A WHOLE
 NEW APPROACH TO SELLING. 

 A SNAZZY NEW LOGO,
 LOTS OF PUBLICITY-- 

 - ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS COLOR? 

 - TRUST ME. 

 WHAT IS THAT?
 WHERE DID YOU GET IT? 

 - A FRIEND. 

 IS IT TOO MUCH? 

 - NO, I LOVE IT. 

 MAYBE OVER THERE
 BY THE DRESSING ROOMS. 

 IT MIGHT WORK. 

 - WELL, MAYBE
 IT HAS ALREADY. 

 - HAVE YOU FALLEN FOR HARRY? 

 YOU HAVE, HAVEN&amp;apos;T YOU? 

 I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.
 I AM SO CLEVER. 

 - WELL, I LIKE HIM. 

 - LIKE? LIKE?
 IS THAT ALL? 

 - HE&amp;apos;S SO DIFFERENT
 FROM PHILIP. 

 - YEAH. HARRY&amp;apos;S ALIVE. 

 - ALL RIGHT.
 IF YOU MUST KNOW, 

 PHILIP AND I-- 

 - IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU 

 THAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LISTEN
 TO YOUR SISTER. 

 - EXCELLENT ADVICE. 

 - HEY.
 - HEY. 

 - HEY, YOU REALLY
 MADE PROGRESS. 

 HERE, THIS IS YOURS, ISN&amp;apos;T IT? 

 - YEAH. WHERE&amp;apos;D YOU GET IT? 

 - DADDY FOUND IT
 AFTER THE PARTY. 

 I FIGURED IT&amp;apos;D BE
 ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE
 YOU GOT OVER THERE, SO... 

 - THANK YOU. 

 - OH, FRANNY,
 MY FRIEND--LAWYER-- 

 HARRY, HE NEEDS
 SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL 

 FOR AN INSURANCE THING. 

 IS THAT SOMETHING YOU COULD DO? 

 - SURE. HAVE HIM
 CALL MY OFFICE. 

 I&amp;apos;LL HAVE SOMEONE SET HIM UP. 

 - I THINK THE CLASP IS BROKEN. 

 - CATE... 

 - WHAT? 

 - IS THAT A RING? 

 GIVE ME YOUR HAND. 

 CYNTHIA! 

 [LAUGHS] 

 CYNTHIA! 

 YOU MIGHT WANT
 TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. 

 [LAUGHING] 

 MAN! [LAUGHS] 

 - WELCOME, PHILIP,
 TO THE FAMILY. 

 - CHEERS.
 - TO YOUR HEALTH. 

 - NOW, YOU&amp;apos;LL BE GIVING CAITLIN
 HER FIRST REAL JOB, 

 AND SHE&amp;apos;LL BE A GOOD WIFE
 TO YOU. 

 - EXCUSE ME, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
 FIRST REAL JOB? 

 - OH, CATE. 

 YOU&amp;apos;VE HAD 17 JOBS
 SINCE YOU LEFT COLLEGE. 

 DON&amp;apos;T THINK
 I HAVEN&amp;apos;T BEEN COUNTING. 

 BUT THIS ONE
 IS A KEEPER, RIGHT, PHIL? 

 - I CERTAINLY HOPE SO, SIR. 

 - AND WHEN MY NEW GRANDCHILDREN
 START SHOWING UP, 

 THEN SHE&amp;apos;LL REALLY KNOW
 WHAT A JOB IS. 

 - I ALREADY HAVE A REAL JOB. 

 AND IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
 THAT WE HAVE CHILDREN-- 

 - WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
 IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
 YOU HAVE CHILDREN? 

 IS THERE SOMETHING
 THE MATTER WITH HIM? 

 - NO, THERE&amp;apos;S NOTHING WRONG
 WITH EITHER OF US. 

 JUST WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T DECIDED
 WHETHER OR NOT 

 WE WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. 

 FRANCESCA, IS THERE
 SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR FACE? 

 BECAUSE IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T, 

 WILL YOU STOP SQUINTING
 AT YOUR SISTER LIKE
 A 12-YEAR-OLD KID? 

 IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
 TO SAY, SAY IT. 

 - OK. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THIS IS THE TIME
 TO DISCUSS THIS. 

 - OH, YOU DON&amp;apos;T THINK? 

 WELL, THIS IS STILL MY HOUSE,
 AND AS LONG AS YOU&amp;apos;RE IN IT, 

 YOU CAN STOP TRYING TO RUN
 OTHER PEOPLE&amp;apos;S LIVES. 

 - NO, FRANNY,
 YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DO THAT, 

 BECAUSE, SEE,
 THAT&amp;apos;S DADDY&amp;apos;S JOB. 

 PHILIP, I&amp;apos;D LIKE TO LEAVE. 

 - OH, CATE, STOP FUSSING.
 SIT DOWN. 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO SIT DOWN.
 I WANT TO LEAVE. 

 - THEN LEAVE. 

 - CATE, LET&amp;apos;S JUST-- 

 - LEAVE. 

 - [CLEARS THROAT] 

 - WELL, THANK YOU
 FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY. 

 - SO LONG, PHILIP. 

 - GOOD NIGHT. 

 GOOD NIGHT.
 THANK YOU, AND... 

 - SO... 

 MARRIAGE, EH? 

 HOW DO YOU FEEL? 

 - I FEEL THAT MAYBE
 I SHOULD BE HAPPIER. 

 - I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. 

 - CAN YOU? 

 - ABSOLUTELY. 

 BEFORE MY MARRIAGE,
 MR. HENDLEY SAID TO ME 

 THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE
 ONE BIG, LONG PARTY. 

 MONTE CARLO,
 SOUTH OF FRANCE, CORFU. 

 - THAT SOUNDS LIKE
 A NICE PARTY. 

 - YES, BUT, YOU SEE, IT WASN&amp;apos;T. 

 I MEAN, ALL THOSE...
 WASTED HOURS. 

 I WOULD&amp;apos;VE PREFERRED TO HAVE
 BEEN OUT HERE, YOU KNOW. 

 I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE DREAD
 OF PARTIES NOW. 

 THIS IS--THIS IS
 WHERE YOU SHOULD BE,
 WITH YOUR PLANTS, 

 YOUR FLOWERS, YOUR FERTILIZER. 

 I&amp;apos;VE GROWN TO LOVE
 THIS DIRT, YOU KNOW. 

 IT NOURISHES THINGS.
 IT GROWS THINGS. 

 IT PROTECTS THINGS.
 I LOVE IT. 

 - SO YOU REGRETTED
 YOUR MARRIAGE? 

 - OH, I WOULDN&amp;apos;T GO
 THAT FAR, NO. 

 BUT I WOULD SAY THIS, CATE.
 I WOULD SAY THAT... 

 MY HUSBAND WAS AS DULL
 AS DITCH WATER. 

 AND WITHOUT YOUR MOTHER&amp;apos;S HELP, 

 I WOULD NEVER HAVE
 MADE IT THROUGH 

 THE THINGS THAT WE CALLED
 "OUR LITTLE TRIALS." 

 - MY FATHER WAS MORE
 THAN A TRIAL. 

 - MM-HMM. 

 - IF IT WASN&amp;apos;T FOR HIM,
 SHE MIGHT STILL BE HERE. 

 - OH, COME ON, CATE.
 YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER
 HAD A BRAIN TUMOR. 

 - BEFORE SHE DIED,
 SHE SAID HER TUMOR WAS... 

 WAS FULL OF FURY AND
 THE RAGING INDIGNATION
 OF THE OPPRESSED. 

 - [LAUGHING] 

 SHE MUST&amp;apos;VE BEEN READING
 TOO MUCH IRISH POETRY, 

 IF YOU ASK ME. 

 [LAUGHING] 

 - WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
 AND GET THAT COLANDER, PLEASE? 

 THANK YOU. 

 WAS THAT JUST SOMETHING
 BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER, 

 OR DO YOU REALLY NOT WANT
 TO HAVE CHILDREN? 

 - NO, I DON&amp;apos;T THINK I DO. 

 - WHY NOT? 

 - WELL... 

 THERE ARE NATURAL MOTHERS,
 AND THERE ARE NATURAL AUNTS, 

 AND I THINK I&amp;apos;M A NATURAL AUNT. 

 - WELL, YOU COULD--
 YOU COULD AT LEAST CONSIDER IT. 

 - I HAVE CONSIDERED IT. 

 IT&amp;apos;S JUST THE WAY I SEE IT,
 ONCE A WOMAN HAS CHILDREN, 

 NOTHING INTERESTING
 EVER HAPPENS TO HER AGAIN. 

 I DIDN&amp;apos;T KNOW
 YOU WANTED CHILDREN. 

 YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT. 

 - THERE WAS NO REASON TO,
 WAS THERE? 

 WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE DONE
 WITH THAT BASIL, 

 YOU COULD START
 ON THE CILANTRO. 

 EXCEPT DON&amp;apos;T CHOP IT UP
 LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME, 

 JUST...LET THE LEAVES
 REMAIN WHOLE. 

 - WHAT&amp;apos;S THE DIFFERENCE?
 IT&amp;apos;S ALL GONNA GET 

 MUSHED UP TOGETHER, ANYWAY. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S MOTHER&amp;apos;S RECIPE. 

 IT&amp;apos;LL BE BETTER
 THIS WAY. YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE. 

 [CASSETTE REWINDS] 

 - HELLO, CATE.
 IT&amp;apos;S ME--HARRY. 

 WELL, I HEARD
 ABOUT YOUR ENGAGEMENT, 

 AND I, UH... 

 I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, 

 EXCEPT I...I STILL HOPE
 TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN. 

 BYE-BYE. 

 - I KNOW.
 I&amp;apos;M LATE. 

 I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD
 THINK I WASN&amp;apos;T COMING. 

 - OH, I WOULDN&amp;apos;T THINK THAT. 

 SO, UH... 

 WELL, HOW&amp;apos;S THE RENOVATION? 

 - UH, IT&amp;apos;S GOOD. 

 IT&amp;apos;S REALLY CHANGING.
 CYNTHIA HAS GREAT IDEAS. 

 SOME...GREAT IDEAS. 

 - I&amp;apos;LL BET. 

 - LISTEN, I--I HAVE A PROBLEM. 

 - WHAT IS IT?
 - IT&amp;apos;S YOU. 

 - I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

 I WON&amp;apos;T BE A PROBLEM ANYMORE. 

 BUT THANK YOU FOR CALLING, 

 &amp;apos;CAUSE I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE
 TO DO THIS IN PERSON. 

 I, UH... 

 I&amp;apos;VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S MY PROBLEM. 

 BUT I DON&amp;apos;T WANT
 TO BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU. 

 - BUT YOU ARE... 

 &amp;apos;CAUSE I&amp;apos;VE FALLEN
 IN LOVE WITH YOU, TOO. 

 NOW, IS THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM? 

 - OH, THAT&amp;apos;S A PROBLEM
 I CAN LIVE WITH. 

 - AND THE LAST AND PERHAPS
 THE MOST SERIOUS OBSTACLE 

 TO MEANINGFUL FISCAL REFORM 

 IS THE CONTINUED EFFORTS
 OF THE LOBBYISTS... 

 - [WHISPERING] 

 - PHILIP. 

 - EXCUSE ME. 

 - THIS JUST ISN&amp;apos;T GONNA WORK. 

 - HE&amp;apos;S JUST TRYING
 TO IMPRESS THE BANKERS. 

 - AND I JUST CAN&amp;apos;T SIT HERE. 

 - CATE, RELAX. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE ALMOST THROUGH HERE, OK? 

 RELAX.
 [CROWD APPLAUDS] 

 - PHILIP. 

 I&amp;apos;M LEAVING. 

 - SWEETHEART, 10 MINUTES. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE GONNA HAVE SOME COFFEE, 

 AND THEN WE&amp;apos;LL BE OUT. 

 RELAX.
 - THIS JUST ISN&amp;apos;T
 GONNA WORK. 

 - FISCAL REFORM? 

 - NO, US. 

 I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

 - THANK YOU. 

 - SO THE RING IS
 NOWHERE IN SIGHT, 

 AND YOU AND HARRY
 ARE AWFULLY COZY. 

 WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME? 

 - NOTHING. 

 - OH. 

 - SO THE NEW MIRRORS
 GOT HERE YESTERDAY-- 

 WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
 AT ME LIKE THAT? 

 SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE&amp;apos;LL BE READY 

 FOR THE REOPENING NEXT WEEK. 

 - GREAT.
 I&amp;apos;LL COME BACK. 

 - COME BACK?
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING? 

 - SIMON CALLED LAST NIGHT 

 BEGGING ME TO COME BACK
 TO NEW YORK. 

 - OH, NO. 

 - I MISS HIM. 

 SO WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO THERAPY, 

 ME AND SIMON
 AND PIERCE COVINGTON. 

 THANK GOODNESS, BECAUSE IF
 I STAY AT DADDY&amp;apos;S MUCH LONGER, 

 I&amp;apos;LL BE BRAIDING MY HAIR
 AND GOING TO THE ORTHODONTIST. 

 - WHERE IS DADDY? 

 - MM, HE SAID HE&amp;apos;D BE LATE. 

 SOMETHING ABOUT
 THE PLUMBING NEXT DOOR. 

 I THINK HE&amp;apos;S GOT
 SOMETHING GOING 

 WITH THE WIDOW CURRINGTON. 

 - CATE, I LOVE IT.
 THANK YOU. 

 - OH, YOU&amp;apos;RE WELCOME. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S GREAT.
 LOOK AT THIS. 

 HUH, WHAT DO
 YOU THINK? 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 - HEY! HEY! 

 WHERE&amp;apos;S MY BIRTHDAY GIRL? 

 - [LAUGHS] HEY! 

 - HELLO, DARLING. 

 - HEY, DOM.
 - HI, HI, HI, HI. 

 NOW THIS IS THAT THERE
 RICE-COOKER THING 

 THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE ALWAYS WANTED. 

 I GOT A GOOD DEAL ON IT. 

 - DADDY, THANK YOU. 

 - HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ANNIE. 

 I HOPE I DIDN&amp;apos;T MISS THE MEAL. 

 - DADDY, YOU REMEMBER HARRY. 

 - OH, YEAH.
 HI. HI, HARRY. 

 - DOMINIC, HOW ARE YOU?
 - FINE, FINE, THANKS. 

 - THIS MAY BE A LITTLE SUDDEN, 

 BUT WHILE WE&amp;apos;RE ALL
 ASSEMBLED HERE, I, UH... 

 I&amp;apos;VE ASKED YOUR YOUNGEST
 DAUGHTER CATE TO MARRY ME... 

 AND SHE SAID YES. 

 - YES! YES! 

 - WAIT A MINUTE.
 DIDN&amp;apos;T YOU-- 

 DIDN&amp;apos;T YOU JUST GET ENGAGED? 

 - YOU ARE SO DEVIOUS. 

 WE NEED MORE CHAMPAGNE. 

 - CONGRATULATIONS. 

 - MY, MY, MY. 

 WELL. 

 PHILIP MOVED OUT, 

 AND HARRY MOVED RIGHT IN, HUH? 

 - I MOVE FAST. 

 - YES, YES. 

 SIT DOWN.
 SIT DOWN, HARRY. 

 MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. 

 WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL. 

 - HERE.
 - NO, I DON&amp;apos;T WANT ANY. 

 - WHAT&amp;apos;S UP?
 - I DON&amp;apos;T WANT ANY. 

 - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 - I&amp;apos;M GOING UPSTAIRS. 

 - WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO OFFER
 MY DAUGHTER, HARRY? 

 I MEAN, I HARDLY KNOW YOU. 

 DO YOU COME FROM A GOOD FAMILY? 

 I MEAN, UH,
 DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY? 

 IS YOUR LEGAL FIRM
 TOP-RANKED, WHAT? 

 - HARRY DOESN&amp;apos;T DO
 CORPORATE LAW, ACTUALLY. 

 - I ASKED HIM, CATIE, NOT YOU. 

 - WELL, I&amp;apos;D SAY THAT... 

 YOUR FAMILY IS ALMOST
 AS CRAZY AS MINE. 

 - AH. 

 - MONEY--I HAVE ENOUGH. 

 PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRM--
 DEFINITELY. 

 - GOOD. GOOD, GOOD. 

 SO, UH, HARRY, 

 WHY ARE YOU SO SPECIAL, THEN? 

 - BECAUSE SHE SAID YES. 

 - AH. 

 - AND WE&amp;apos;D LIKE
 YOUR BLESSING, DOMINIC. 

 BUT IF YOU HAVE
 ANY OBJECTION, 

 PLEASE SPEAK NOW. 

 - OH, WHY BOTHER? 

 CAITLIN HASN&amp;apos;T CARED ABOUT
 WHAT I&amp;apos;VE SAID FOR YEARS, 

 HAVE YOU, CATIE? 

 - WELL, WE BOTH DO CARE
 WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. 

 - OH, THANK YOU.
 GOOD, GOOD. 

 WELL, THEN, UH... 

 I HAVE NO OBJECTION, COUNSELOR. 

 COME ON!
 LET&amp;apos;S CELEBRATE, HUH? 

 COME ON! CELEBRATE! 

 HERE WE GO. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T SEE ANY FOOD. 

 WHAT KIND OF A PARTY
 IS THIS? COME ON. 

 - [WHISPERING] Cate.
 Cate, come here. 

 - What?
 - Come here. I have
 to talk to you. 

 IF YOU TELL ANYONE
 THAT I TOLD YOU THIS, 

 I WILL DENY IT. 

 I COULD LOSE MY LICENSE
 FOR TELLING YOU. 

 - WH-WHAT ARE YOU
 TALKING ABOUT? 

 - YOU REMEMBER HARRY CAME
 FOR HIS PHYSICAL? 

 THE LAB REPORT
 ON HIS BLOOD WORK-UP 

 INDICATED EXCESSIVE WHITE CELLS, 

 SO WE SENT A SAMPLE
 TO AN INDEPENDENT LAB
 FOR VERIFICATION. 

 NOW, WE&amp;apos;RE NOT GONNA
 KNOW ANYTHING 

 UNTIL WE GET THE SECOND LABS. 

 HARRY DOESN&amp;apos;T
 KNOW ANYTHING YET. 

 - HARRY DOESN&amp;apos;T KNOW WHAT? 

 - I&amp;apos;M SORRY, BUT IT LOOKS
 LIKE HARRY HAS LEUKEMIA. 

 - WELL, SHOULD WE
 EVEN HAVE A BAND? 

 IS IT TOO MUCH? 

 MAYBE JUST A GUITAR... 

 OR A HARP. 

 LOVE HARPS, 

 IF YOU CAN STILL FIND A HARP. 

 DOMINIC CALLED. 

 HE WANTS TRUMPETS
 AND LOTS OF &amp;apos;EM. 

 HE WANTS YOU ALL IN WHITE,
 THE BRIDESMAIDS IN PINK, 

 AND A TROOP OF RING BEARERS
 ON VALENTINE&amp;apos;S DAY. 

 - WHY DIDN&amp;apos;T HE CALL ME? 

 - WELL, HE WAS AFRAID YOU
 WOULDN&amp;apos;T GO FOR THE TRUMPETS. 

 - DO YOU-- 

 DO YOU REALLY WANT
 A BIG WEDDING? 

 - IF YOU DO. 

 - WELL, IT SOUNDS
 KIND OF AWFUL. 

 DAD YELLING
 AT EVERYBODY AND... 

 - OH, I GET THE PICTURE. 

 - WE COULD JUST... 

 YOU KNOW, GET MARRIED. 

 - NO RING BEARERS. 

 - NO ANYTHING.
 JUST US. 

 - AND WE WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO WAIT
 TILL VALENTINE&amp;apos;S DAY. 

 - WE WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE
 TO WAIT AT ALL. 

 - I&amp;apos;D LIKE THAT. 

 - ENOUGH TO DO IT? 

 - THIS IS NOT ALL ABOUT
 ANNOYING DOMINIC, IS IT? 

 - NO, NOT AT ALL. 

 IT&amp;apos;S JUST, IF--
 IF WE WANT TO-- 

 AND--AND I WANT TO-- 

 WHY WAIT? 

 - GO GET MARRIED. 

 - YEAH. 

 - HARRY, DO YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN
 TO BE YOUR WEDDED WIFE? 

 - I DO.
 - AND, CAITLIN, 

 DO YOU TAKE THIS MAN TO BE
 YOUR WEDDED HUSBAND? 

 - I DO. 

 - THEN BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME 

 BY THE GREAT
 COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, 

 I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
 MAN AND WIFE. 

 YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE,
 SIR, AND-- 

 [POUNDING] 

 - I, UH--- 

 I HOPE YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT
 TOO DISAPPOINTED, 

 NO BIG WEDDING AND ALL. 

 CATE AND I
 PREFERRED IT THAT WAY. 

 - GIVE ME THAT BRACE AND BIT,
 WILL YOU? 

 OH, CAITLIN&amp;apos;S A GROWN WOMAN. 

 SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS. 

 SHE&amp;apos;S A LOT LIKE HER MOTHER. 

 - UH, THE BRACE THING
 YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT? 

 - YEAH, THAT THING
 WITH THE HANDLE THERE.
 THE BROWN THING. 

 - OH.
 - NEAR THE WIRE. 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW A SCREWDRIVER
 FROM A SOCKET WRENCH. 

 - [CHUCKLES]
 DON&amp;apos;T WORRY. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T NEED TO BE HANDY
 WITH CAITLIN AROUND. 

 YEAH. 

 OK. 

 GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH. 

 - YOU ARE SOMETHING, CATE. 

 DON&amp;apos;T YOU PAY ATTENTION
 TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS TO YOU? 

 COULDN&amp;apos;T YOU
 AT LEAST HAVE WAITED 

 UNTIL WE KNEW FOR SURE? 

 - THAT WOULD BE--
 THAT WOULD BE SUCH A MISTAKE. 

 HE COULD LIVE FOR YEARS 

 AND YEARS AND YEARS 

 AND--AND BE FINE. 

 - LIVE FOR YEARS, YES. 

 BE FINE, I&amp;apos;M NOT SO SURE. 

 HAVE YOU THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT 

 WHAT YOUR LIFE IS GOING
 TO BE LIKE WITH HIM? 

 [TELEPHONE RINGS] 

 OH... 

 [RING] 

 HELLO. 

 HEY. 

 YEAH, SHE&amp;apos;S RIGHT HERE.
 HANG ON. 

 IT&amp;apos;S CYNTHIA. 

 - OH, OH.
 HELLO. 

 - MRS. HARRY DIETRICH. 

 I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE THE ONLY ONE SO FAR
 WHO&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY SAID THAT. 

 - WHAT DID DAD SAY? 

 - NOT MUCH. 

 HE&amp;apos;S ALREADY GOT HARRY
 UP ON A LADDER. 

 THEY SEEM TO BE HITTING IT OFF. 

 - HE LIKES HARRY BECAUSE
 HE STANDS UP TO HIM. 

 - I STAND UP TO HIM.
 HE DOESN&amp;apos;T LIKE ME. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE HIS DAUGHTER. 

 OH, HEY, LISTEN. 

 SIMON IS GONNA COME
 TO THE OPENING, 

 SO WE&amp;apos;LL GET
 SOME FREE PRESS. 

 - OH, GREAT. 

 FAME AT LAST. 

 CYNTHIA? 

 - YEAH? 

 - THANK YOU. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE WELCOME. 

 [DOOR OPENS] 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 - OH, HI. YOU&amp;apos;RE HOME. 

 WHAT&amp;apos;S WRONG? 

 IS EVERYTHING OK? 

 - NO. 

 - WHAT? 

 - YOU REMEMBER THE, UH... 

 THE INSURANCE PHYSICAL I HAD
 A COUPLE WEEKS AGO? 

 WELL, HE CALLED TODAY. 

 I HAVE LEUKEMIA. 

 YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN&amp;apos;T YOU? 

 FRANCESCA TOLD YOU. 

 - SHE WASN&amp;apos;T SURE. 

 - SHE TOLD YOU BEFORE
 WE GOT MARRIED, DIDN&amp;apos;T SHE? 

 - SHE DIDN&amp;apos;T KNOW FOR SURE, 

 AND I THOUGHT THAT
 IF YOU KNEW OR... 

 OR EVEN SUSPECTED, THAT YOU&amp;apos;D-- 

 - MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION
 ABOUT MY FUTURE? 

 ABOUT OUR FUTURE? 

 YOU DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK
 I WAS UP TO THAT? 

 - NO, WAIT. 

 I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN&amp;apos;T WANT
 TO MARRY ME. 

 - OH. 

 I PROMISED YOU THE LIFE I-- 

 I MEAN, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU. 

 - I-- 

 I LOVE YOU, SICK OR NOT. 

 - I LOVE YOU. 

 - [PEOPLE TALKING] 

 - I CAN KEEP THOSE TO THE SIDE 

 WHILE YOU KEEP LOOKING. 

 - THANKS.

 EVERYTHING&amp;apos;S MARKED. 

 EVERYTHING&amp;apos;S FINE. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE UP AND GOING, OK, CATE?

 A NEW YORK BRANCH. 

 HARRY. 

 HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
 I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

 YOU MUST BE TIRED
 OF HEARING THAT. 

 - NO, NOT AT ALL. 

 IT&amp;apos;S--IT&amp;apos;S
 THE BRAVE SMILE I WEAR 

 THAT GETS A LITTLE EXHAUSTING. 

 - CHEERS.
 - CHEERS. 

 - AND THIS MUST BE HARRY. 

 HOW ARE YA?

 NICE TO MEET YOU, SIMON. 

 - NICE TO MEET YOU. 

 CATE, MY PUBLICIST
 WANTS A WORD WITH YOU
 IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT, 

 SOMETHING ABOUT THE "POST."

 AREN&amp;apos;T THEY BEAUTIFUL?
 CATE&amp;apos;S FRIEND MAKES THEM. 

 I WANT ALL OF OUR BRIDESMAIDS
 TO WEAR ARABELLAS. 

 WON&amp;apos;T IT BE BRILLIANT? 

 - WHO&amp;apos;S ARABELLA? 

 - IF SIMON&amp;apos;S I.Q. WAS HIGHER
 THAN THE SPEED LIMIT, 

 HE&amp;apos;D NEVER SURVIVE CYNTHIA. 

 - [CHUCKLES] 

 CAN&amp;apos;T BE EASY
 LIVING WITH A GODDESS. 

 - TELL ME ABOUT IT. 

 SINCE I WAS 13,
 SHE&amp;apos;S MADE ME FEEL ORDINARY. 

 - THERE&amp;apos;S NOTHING
 ORDINARY ABOUT YOU.

 - WOW. WHICH ONE ARE YOU? 

 - ME AT THE END THERE. 

 - WHERE WAS THIS?

 I STILL GOT A HUNK OF SHRAPNEL
 IN MY SHOULDER TO REMIND ME. 

 - PURPLE HEART?

 - WOW. WHAT HAPPENED? 

 - WELL, WE WERE
 PATROLLING OFFSHORE 

 TO PICK UP SOME PILOT
 THAT HAD GOT SHOT DOWN, 

 AND ME AND MY BEST BUDDY, 

 KENNY, THIS GUY HERE, 

 WE WERE WORKING
 THE FORWARD TURRET. 

 WE GOT A DIRECT HIT
 JUST BELOW THE GUN MOUNT, 

 AND, UH,
 IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS, 

 IT WAS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
 WAS ON FIRE. 

 I KNEW THE MAGAZINE WAS GONNA GO 

 BECAUSE WE HAD
 POWDER BAGS ALL OVER. 

 SO I MANAGED
 TO GET HOLD OF THE HOSE, 

 AND I&amp;apos;M HOSING EVERYTHING DOWN. 

 WELL, I SEE KENNY ON THE DECK. 

 HE WAS BURNT. 

 OH, HE WAS BURNT BAD. 

 SO, UH, 

 FINALLY GOT HIM OUT AND... 

 CARRIED HIM TOPSIDE. 

 IT WAS OVER. 

 WHY DON&amp;apos;T YOU--
 WHY DON&amp;apos;T YOU STRETCH OUT, 

 LAY DOWN, BE COMFORTABLE. 

 - I DON&amp;apos;T MIND IF I DO. 

 - GOOD, COME ON.
 I&amp;apos;LL GIVE YOU A HAND. 

 HERE, LET&amp;apos;S PUT THIS OVER YOU. 

 - YEAH, THANKS. 

 ALL RIGHT, THANKS. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO TUCK ME IN. 

 IT&amp;apos;S ALL RIGHT.

 I&amp;apos;M SORRY. IT&amp;apos;S A... 

 IT&amp;apos;S AN OLD HABIT. 

 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS] 

 CATE.
 - HI. 

 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 

 - WELL, SOMEONE
 SHOULD BE WITH HIM. 

 YOU WEREN&amp;apos;T. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE HOME EARLY. 

 WHAT&amp;apos;S WRONG? 

 - I&amp;apos;M PREGNANT. 

 - REALLY? 

 - IS THIS TOO MUCH? 

 CAN YOU HANDLE IT? 

 - OH, YEAH. 

 OH, YEAH. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE GONNA HAVE A BABY? 

 HELLO.

 - I GUESS I&amp;apos;M NOT
 DYING AFTER ALL, 

 NOT RIGHT AWAY, ANYWAY. 

 - GOT A LONG WAY TO GO YET. 

 - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

 - WELL, TECHNICALLY,
 YOUR HUSBAND&amp;apos;S IN REMISSION, 

 BUT IT CAN REOCCUR AT ANY TIME. 

 HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS
 OF THE CHEMO, 

 THE WEIGHT LOSS AND NAUSEA, 

 SHOULD EASE OFF IN A FEW DAYS. 

 OK, HARRY? 

 - IT&amp;apos;S OK WITH ME. 

 - WE&amp;apos;LL SEE YOU IN 2 WEEKS. 

 - ALL RIGHT.
 THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

 ANYTHING I CAN DO, 

 DON&amp;apos;T HESITATE. 

 MAY I INTRODUCE... 

 CAROL, MY FIANCEE.

 OH, OH, UH--

 WONDERFUL. 

 CONTENT. 

 IT&amp;apos;S A GOOD LOOK.

 IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU. 

 - NICE MEETING YOU. 

 - CONGRATULATIONS.

 COME ON. 

 SO?
 - SHE&amp;apos;S GREAT. 

 - LISTEN, WE GOT
 A 7:00 TEE TIME TOMORROW. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE STILL LOOKING
 FOR A FOURTH. 

 - OH, I WISH I COULD BE THERE. 

 WHERE YOU PLAYING? 

 - ROCK CREEK. 

 - OH.
 - THANKS, FRANCESCA. 

 HOW YA FEELING, ANYWAY? 

 - PRETTY GOOD. 

 - YEAH, &amp;apos;CAUSE, UH, 

 I HEAR YOUR LAST TEST RESULTS
 WERE REALLY GREAT. 

 - YEAH, THEY WERE.
 I JUST GOT &amp;apos;EM BACK
 THIS MORNING. 

 HOW&amp;apos;D YOU FIND OUT? 

 FROM FAMILY NEWS NETWORK
 OVER THERE? 

 - WASN&amp;apos;T ME.
 CATE TOLD US. 

 - HARRY, YOU LOOK GOOD,
 BUT I WISH YOU&amp;apos;D PUT ON
 SOME WEIGHT. 

 - YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANT
 TO START DOING 

 A LITTLE WALKING
 EVERY DAY IF YOU LIKE. 

 - FOR HEAVEN&amp;apos;S SAKES,
 LEAVE THE MAN ALONE. 

 BUNCH OF INTERFERING WOMEN. 

 - I LOVE THE INTERFERENCE,
 AND SO DO YOU, 

 ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY INTERFERE
 WITH A GOOD MEAL. 

 - WELL, COOKING IS ONE THING, 

 BUT THEY DON&amp;apos;T
 HAVE TO RUN OUR LIVES. 

 - NO, COOKING&amp;apos;S--COOKING&amp;apos;S FINE, 

 AND FRANNY CAN BE A DOCTOR 

 AS LONG AS SHE SETS THE TABLE 

 AND DOES THE DISHES. 

 - SHE WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE A DOCTOR
 IF IT WASN&amp;apos;T FOR ME. 

 I WANTED HER TO GO ON
 TO BE A SURGEON. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S NEVER ENOUGH, IS IT? 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE CRITICIZING ME 

 FOR HELPING YOUR SISTER
 MAKE SOMETHING OF HERSELF? 

 - COME ON.
 IT&amp;apos;S THE FOURTH OF JULY. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE ALL HERE TOGETHER.
 LET&amp;apos;S JUST BE HAPPY. 

 - HARRY, LET&amp;apos;S GO. 

 - YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT WALKING OUT
 ON ANOTHER FAMILY DINNER,
 ARE YOU, CATE? 

 - OH, HONEY, COME ON.
 WHERE YOU GOING? 

 - TAKE--TAKE--TAKE MY PURSE. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL 

 SO I CAN HAVE THE BABY. 

 - REALLY?
 - YES, REALLY. 

 I DARE YOU TO TELL ME
 I LOOK BEAUTIFUL. 

 - YOU DO. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE BEAUTIFUL. 

 AND SO&amp;apos;S THIS TINY, LITTLE BOY. 

 - DIDN&amp;apos;T FEEL SO TINY TO ME. 

 - NO. [CHUCKLES] 

 - WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

 - I THINK HE&amp;apos;S PERFECT. 

 STILL A LITTLE RED
 AND WRINKLY... 

 BUT TOUGH. 

 - ARE YOU OK?
 RIGHT THERE? 

 - YEAH. 

 - HI!
 [ALL LAUGHING] 

 - HEY.
 - HEY. 

 - [CRYING]
 - OHH! 

 - I WAS JUST SAYING HOW GREAT
 IT WAS TO BE HOME 

 AND ALONE AGAIN. 

 - DINNER IS IN THE OVEN ON LOW, 

 THE TABLE IS SET, 

 AND THE CRIB IS ALL MADE UP... 

 AND WE...ARE OUT OF HERE. 

 - OH--OH, JUST A SEC. 

 - HE LOOKS JUST LIKE
 THAT CUPID IN THE STORE. 

 - COME ON. YOU CAN ADMIRE
 THE BABY LATER. 

 - OHH! 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S BETTER, HUH? BYE! 

 - [LAUGHS] 

 THANKS, YOU GUYS. 

 - THANKS! BYE-BYE! 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 NOW, I THINK YOU COULD
 USE A FEW MORE SISTERS. 

 - [LAUGHS] 

 - ANYONE ELSE
 I CAN EXPECT TODAY? 

 - NOPE. 

 JUST ME. 

 ME AND THE LITTLE GUY. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S GOOD TO BE HOME. 

 - YEAH. 

 ARE YOU ASLEEP? 

 I CAN HEAR YOU BLINKING. 

 - OH, I THINK OUR SLEEPING DAYS
 ARE OVER. 

 I&amp;apos;M LAYING HERE THINKING
 ABOUT PATRICK... 

 WHAT MIGHT BECOME OF HIM. 

 - HE&amp;apos;S GONNA BE JUST LIKE YOU. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT I&amp;apos;M AFRAID OF. 

 PRETTY SOON HE&amp;apos;LL BE DRIVING. 

 AND WE&amp;apos;LL BE LYING AWAKE 

 WAITING FOR HIM TO COME HOME. 

 - THEN YOU CAN GO OUT
 AND GET HIM. 

 - I WILL, TOO. 

 - I KNOW YOU WILL. 

 - AREN&amp;apos;T YOU A LITTLE WORRIED? 

 - RIGHT NOW I&amp;apos;M JUST
 HAPPY TO LOOK AT HIM. 

 - THINK WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO THIS? 

 - OH, YEAH. 

 - IT&amp;apos;S WAY PAST TIME 

 YOU LEARNED HOW TO WALK, PAL. 

 GOOD MORNING. 

 - OH, CATE, HI. 

 COME HERE, COME HERE,
 COME HERE. GOOD NEWS. 

 - WHAT?
 - PROFIT, PROFIT, PROFIT. 

 4 MONTHS IN A ROW. 

 EVEN THE HATS ARE SELLING. 

 - NO.
 - THIS IS A DEFINITE TREND HERE. 

 - DID YOU HEAR THAT?
 LOOKS LIKE YOU&amp;apos;RE GONNA BE ABLE 

 TO GO TO COLLEGE AFTER ALL. 

 OHH. I FEEL LIKE I&amp;apos;VE BEEN AWAKE 

 SINCE THE DAY HE WAS BORN. 

 - OH, DARLING, LET ME
 HOLD HIM, PLEASE. 

 I&amp;apos;D LOVE TO, YES. 

 OHH...[BABY TALK] 

 HE&amp;apos;S SLEEPY.
 [TELEPHONE RINGS] 

 - CYNTHIA&amp;apos;S. 

 YES? 

 WHAT-- 

 WHERE? 

 OH... 

 STAY WITH HIM.
 I&amp;apos;LL BE BACK. 

 - HE&amp;apos;S DOING FINE. 

 - TELL ME THE TRUTH. 

 - HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM&amp;apos;S
 SUPPRESSED. 

 HE APPEARS TO BE
 CLINICALLY STABLE, 

 BUT WE&amp;apos;LL WATCH HIM
 FOR A FEW DAYS. 

 - I WISH I HAD A STRONGER IDEA 

 THAT YOU PEOPLE KNEW
 WHAT YOU WERE DOING. 

 I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

 - DON&amp;apos;T BE SORRY.
 I FEEL THE SAME WAY. 

 SOMETIMES I THINK
 WE&amp;apos;VE BEATEN THIS THING. 

 OTHER TIMES... 

 IT SEEMS LIKE
 IT&amp;apos;S LAUGHING AT US. 

 WE DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IT ALL. 

 YOU GO HOME
 AND GET SOME SLEEP. 

 I&amp;apos;LL LOOK IN ON HARRY
 LATER TONIGHT. 

 WE&amp;apos;LL CALL
 IF THERE&amp;apos;S ANY CHANGE. 

 - 7 POUNDS, 11 OUNCES. 

 OH, YOU&amp;apos;RE GETTING SO BIG. 

 ARE YOU GETTING ANY SLEEP? 

 - I NAP AT THE HOSPITAL. 

 - [CRYING]
 - OHH! 

 - YES, SUGAR. 

 I CAN GIVE YOU A SEDATIVE. 

 - NO. I&amp;apos;M ALL RIGHT. 

 MM. FRANCESCA? 

 THANKS FOR NOT SAYING
 "I TOLD YOU SO." 

 - I&amp;apos;M SORRY I CAN&amp;apos;T MAKE
 EVERYTHING BETTER FOR YOU. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE VERY BRAVE, CATIE. 

 [DOOR CLOSES] 

 - [CRYING] 

 [CATE BLOWS OUT CANDLE] 

 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 

 [KNOCKING] 

 - HI, CATE.
 - HI. 

 - I HAVE SOMETHING FOR THE BABY. 

 I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, 

 SO I THOUGHT I&amp;apos;D DROP ON UP. 

 - OH... 

 UH... 

 YEAH, WELL, THAT&amp;apos;S-- 

 THAT&amp;apos;S REALLY SWEET, DAD.
 THAT&amp;apos;S CUTE. 

 BUT HE&amp;apos;S--HE&amp;apos;S ASLEEP. 

 - OH. 

 WELL, I&amp;apos;LL JUST--I&amp;apos;LL
 JUST PUT IT DOWN HERE. 

 - OK.
 - SO, UH, HOW&amp;apos;S HARRY DOING? 

 - HE&amp;apos;S GOOD. 

 HE&amp;apos;S HOLDING HIS OWN. 

 WHATEVER THAT MEANS. 

 - GOOD. GOOD.
 NOW, CAN I SEE THE BABY? 

 - OH, I, UM--HE WAS
 UP ALL NIGHT, 

 SO I&amp;apos;D LIKE TO LET HIM SLEEP. 

 - I&amp;apos;M NOT SURPRISED
 HE&amp;apos;S UP ALL NIGHT 

 IF HE SLEEPS ALL DAY, CATE. 

 YOU DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO TO HIM
 EVERY TIME HE CRIES. 

 LET HIM CRY.
 HE&amp;apos;LL GET THE MESSAGE. 

 NOW, CAN I SEE THE BABY-- 

 - UH, DAD, I JUST--
 I JUST PUT HIM DOWN. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO WAKE HIM UP. 

 - I DIDN&amp;apos;T ASK YOU
 TO WAKE HIM UP. 

 I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT HIM. 

 I WANT TO SEE
 WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.
 LET ME LOOK AT HIM. 

 - WHY DO YOU HAVE
 TO THINK OF EVERYTHING 

 IN TERMS OF HOW
 IT AFFECTS YOU?
 HE&amp;apos;S ASLEEP. 

 UH, COME BACK
 LATER OR NOT. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T REALLY CARE. 

 BUT YOU CAN&amp;apos;T SEE HIM NOW. 

 PLEASE GO. 

 - I KNOW WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE
 AFRAID OF, CATE. 

 YOU&amp;apos;RE AFRAID
 THAT HARRY WILL DIE, 

 AND YOU DON&amp;apos;T WANT
 TO LIVE WITHOUT HIM. 

 THAT&amp;apos;S HOW I FELT
 ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. 

 BUT YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO LIVE, CATE. 

 YOUR LIFE WON&amp;apos;T BE THE SAME, 

 BUT YOU&amp;apos;LL LIVE. 

 - [SIGHS] 

 - HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? 

 - ME?
 - MM. 

 - [SIGHS] 

 WELL... 

 PATRICK IS FINALLY SLEEPING
 THROUGH THE NIGHT... 

 - GREAT. 

 - AND... 

 UM... 

 I TOLD MY FATHER TO GET LOST, 

 WHICH APPARENTLY HE HAS. 

 - WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
 TO DO THAT? 

 - HE JUST--HE DROPPED BY
 ONE TOO MANY TIMES. 

 HE SHOWED UP.
 I&amp;apos;D BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
 WITH THE BABY, 

 AND HE WANTED ME TO WAKE HIM UP. 

 - WELL...HE&amp;apos;S LONELY. 

 - YEAH, WITH GOOD REASON. 

 - HIS WIFE IS DEAD. 

 HIS DAUGHTERS HAVE LEFT. 

 AND THEY HAVE PRETTY GOOD LIVES, 

 WITH NO SMALL THANKS TO HIM. 

 - ARE YOU KIDDING? 

 HE&amp;apos;S DONE NOTHING 

 BUT SINGLE ME OUT
 FROM DAY ONE. 

 TRIED TO CRUSH ME,
 LIKE HE DID MY MOTHER. 

 I JUST--RIGHT NOW I JUST
 WANT HIM OUT OF MY LIFE. 

 - THERE IS SO MUCH MORE
 TO HIM THAN YOU CAN SEE. 

 AND THERE&amp;apos;S SO MUCH MORE
 TO YOU THAN HE CAN SEE. 

 BUT OUR SON DESERVES
 A GRANDFATHER. 

 ESPECIALLY ONE
 THAT WANTS TO BE AROUND. 

 - IF YOU DIE? 

 - IF I LIVE, I WANT HIM
 TO KNOW DOMINIC. 

 [BELLS RINGING] 

 - GOD BLESS YOU. 

 - THANK YOU, FATHER.
 - HELLO, CATE. 

 - I&amp;apos;M SO GLAD YOU COULD DO IT. 

 - OHH.
 - THANK YOU, FATHER. 

 - HI, HARRY.
 - IT WAS
 A BEAUTIFUL CHRISTENING. 

 SAY THANK YOU, PATRICK. 

 NOW YOU SAY,
 "THANK YOU, FATHER." 

 - OHH.
 - THERE YOU GO. 

 THERE YOU GO.
 [LAUGHS] 

 YOU WERE GREAT, PAL. 

 YOU WERE GREAT. 

 GOOD JOB, BUDDY. 

 GOOD JOB. 

 AUNT FRANNY... 

 UNCLE JERRY. 

 - HI, SWEETIE.
 - AUNT ANNETTE... 

 - I SEE CAITLIN&amp;apos;S... 

 KEEPING UP YOUR FLOWERS. 

 WELL, GRACE, THEY&amp;apos;RE ALL HERE. 

 EVEN THE ACTOR. 

 I THINK I&amp;apos;M GONNA HAVE TO GET
 A LARGER DINING ROOM TABLE. 

 OH, GRACIE. 

 GRACIE, I MISS YOU SO MUCH. 

 JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS
 SAID I WOULD. 

 - HI. 

 - OH, HI. 

 - UH, NO.
 DAD, WAIT. I... 

 THIS IS AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY. 

 BETTER THAN MOST, I... 

 [VOICE CRACKING]
 WELL, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, 

 NOT JUST FOR
 WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK-- 

 - I WAS WRONG. 

 DROPPING BY
 WITHOUT CALLING FIRST. 

 - NO! DAD, WOULD YOU JUST
 LET ME SAY IT! 

 - HE WAS PROBABLY SO STUNNED 

 TO HEAR THE WORD "APOLOGIZE"
 COME OUT OF CATE&amp;apos;S MOUTH, 

 HE DIDN&amp;apos;T KNOW
 WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF. 

 GRACE, MAYA, GO AND WASH UP. 

 WE&amp;apos;RE EATING IN 5 MINUTES. 

 - WELL, WE DON&amp;apos;T KNOW
 WHAT TO DO, EITHER. 

 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

 - WELL, WE DON&amp;apos;T. 

 CYNTHIA, YOU JUST SPOIL HIM, 

 AND FRANCESCA IS TOO BUSY, 

 AND I... 

 HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
 IT WAS CATE&amp;apos;S ISSUE 

 AND IT DIDN&amp;apos;T AFFECT ME,
 BUT LET&amp;apos;S FACE IT... 

 IT AFFECTS ALL OF US. 

 - OH, THANK YOU. 

 - IS ANYBODY TALKING
 TO ANYBODY? 

 - I TRIED THAT.
 DIDN&amp;apos;T WORK. 

 - CAITLIN. 

 WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN ME
 AND YOUR MOTHER 

 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 

 - FINE. 

 - AT YOUR AGE, I SHOULD THINK
 YOU&amp;apos;D UNDERSTAND THAT. 

 - I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. 

 I SAW THE WAY YOU TREATED HER.
 I THOUGHT YOU HATED HER. 

 I USED TO DREAM ABOUT
 RUNNING AWAY WITH HER 

 SO SHE COULD HAVE SOME PEACE. 

 - DON&amp;apos;T TELL ME HOW I FELT
 ABOUT MY WIFE! 

 YOU THOUGHT I DIDN&amp;apos;T
 LOVE YOUR MOTHER? 

 HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT? 

 - BECAUSE YOU YELLED AT HER
 LIKE YOU&amp;apos;RE YELLING AT ME! 

 I&amp;apos;M SORRY.
 MAYBE I DIDN&amp;apos;T UNDERSTAND,
 AND--AND-- 

 I WAS TRYING
 TO SAY I WAS SORRY. 

 - WELL... 

 BETTER LATE THAN NEVER, I GUESS. 

 - THAT&amp;apos;S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 

 WHETHER YOU ACCEPT
 HER APOLOGY OR YOU DON&amp;apos;T. 

 - MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
 FRANCESCA. 

 - THIS IS MY BUSINESS, DAMN IT. 

 - DON&amp;apos;T CURSE AT THIS TABLE! 

 - HA HA!
 YOU KNOW WHAT? 

 YOUR YELLING DOESN&amp;apos;T
 INTIMIDATE ME. 

 YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES?
 IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE. 

 FROM NOW ON, IF YOU HAVE
 ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME, 

 ANYTHING AT ALL, 

 YOU WILL SAY IT
 IN A RESPECTFUL MANNER, 

 LIKE A HUMAN BEING! 

 - ARE YOU FINISHED?
 - NO, WE&amp;apos;RE NOT. 

 WELL, AT ANY RATE, I&amp;apos;M NOT. 

 YOU CAN&amp;apos;T EVEN ACCEPT
 CATE&amp;apos;S APOLOGY 

 WITHOUT STICKING
 IN YOUR 2 CENTS&amp;apos; WORTH 

 OF ANGER AND BITTERNESS. 

 WELL, IT&amp;apos;S NOT RIGHT! 

 AND I&amp;apos;M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
 AND LET IT GO BY. 

 - HONEY--
 - NO! I&amp;apos;M TIRED OF SMILING 

 AND PRETENDING EVERYTHING&amp;apos;S OK.
 IT&amp;apos;S NOT OK! 

 - YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
 TO SAY THAT TO ME. 

 I DON&amp;apos;T SEE ANY OF YOU
 RAISING 4 KIDS 

 AND BUILDING A BUSINESS
 AT THE SAME TIME. 

 WITH A SICK WIFE IN BED! 

 - SHE WASN&amp;apos;T SICK. 

 SHE WAS DRUNK. 

 - DON&amp;apos;T YOU
 CRITICIZE YOUR MOTHER 

 AT THIS TABLE. 

 AND NOT A ONE OF YOU 

 CAN EVEN COME THIS CLOSE TO HER! 

 OH, I THANK GOD
 SHE&amp;apos;S NOT HERE 

 TO LISTEN TO WHAT
 YOU HAVE TO SAY! 

 - DAD! 

 YOU CAN&amp;apos;T JUST WALK
 AWAY FROM ME AGAIN! 

 - I CAN. IF YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING
 TO ATTACK HER. 

 - WHY WOULD I ATTACK HER? 

 [CRYING]
 I LOST HER, TOO! 

 SHE WAS MY MOTHER! 

 - [TAKES DEEP BREATH] 

 I&amp;apos;D FIND HER
 OUT HERE SOMETIMES... 

 CURLED UP ON THIS BENCH. 

 SLEEPING IT OFF. 

 I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD
 TO GET HER TO STOP, 

 BUT NOTHING WORKED. 

 I COULDN&amp;apos;T SAVE HER. 

 FINALLY, ALL I COULD
 DO WAS YELL, 

 AND THAT ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE. 

 FOR YOU AND EVERYBODY. 

 [SOFTLY] I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

 WITH HER GONE, I FEEL LIKE
 I&amp;apos;VE LOST SOMETHING OF MYSELF. 

 - ME, TOO. 

 - WELL... 

 AT LEAST WE HAVE
 ONE THING IN COMMON. 

 - [TAKES DEEP BREATH] 

 THAT AND-- 

 AND YOUR GRANDSON. 

 - YOU, HARRY, AND THE BABY... 

 WHATEVER HAPPENS, CATIE... 

 WE&amp;apos;LL GET THROUGH IT.
