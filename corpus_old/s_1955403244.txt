(bats screeching)

(screaming in distance)

(apprehensive music)


No, no, no, no, no.

Get up here.

Please no.

Get up here.


C'mon.

No, stop.

Hey.

You though you were smarter
than me, didn't you?

No, stop.

You thought you could
hide it from me, right?

Stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no.

You didn't think I'd find out.


You go ahead and scream,
scream all you want.


I love the sound of screams.


Screams are the music of the dead.

hurts, stop, no, no, no, no.


Did it hurt, huh?

That's the whole point.

It hurts, I'm innocent.

I promise I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

Which is it girl?

Are you innocent or did you do it?

I didn't do it,

I didn't do it.
Both can't be true.

What about this?

How do you explain this, huh?

I told you, I don't want
these things in the house.

It's just a cellphone.

It's the devil's earpiece.


No, no, no, no, no, no.

Dad please, please let me go, please,

please, please, please,
please, please, please,

please, please, please, please,

please, will you let me go?

Please, please.


Next time I find one
of those in your room,

your punishment isn't gonna
be so short and sweet.

Oh, no it won't.

Whatever.

I'm faster than you are,
I'm faster than you are.


(dramatic music)

(birds chirping)

What was all that
caterwauling I heard downstairs?

Nothing dear.

You're too hard on her,
she's only a teenager.

Not hard enough, I say.

The consommÃ© is salty.

Tastes fine, what's for lunch?

I believe it's lamb today.

One of ours or from the village?

One of ours, Sophia.

And don't tell Peter, you know

how he feels about our livestock.

Whatever you say dearest.

(bell chiming)

Claudia.

Si Signora.

No, no, no.
No?

No Signora.

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

I could have sworn Claudia
just said something to me.


Peter, Peter?

Come, come join us.

Mangia.

Tasty lamb, isn't it Peter?

Sophia always looked
kind of scrawny to me.

Never thought she had
much meat on her but,

guess I was wrong.

She's damn delicious.

Oh, I forgot.


I wasn't supposed to say anything.

Carver, really?

It's okay, Peter, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

Sophia va, Sophia.

See what you're done?

He's a grown man, he should act like it.

Grow up, you hear me?


Is that any way to treat your bother?

Half-brother.

That damn village mother
of his made him so stupid.

And where the hell's
that daughter of ours?

Lunchtime is supposed to be for family.

Naomi, get the hell down here.

(apprehensive music)


Aw, uncle Peter, what's wrong, huh?

You're late, I told you
to be on time for meals.

Yes, sorry dad.

Maybe what you need is
another trip downstairs.

What's wrong with uncle Peter?

Your father did the
injustice of telling him that

we're having Sophia for lunch.

Sophia (sobbing)

Oh no, Sophia was one of his favorites.

Now she's my favorite (chuckling)

I'm sorry.

Here, woof?

You've got other lambs.


Sorry uncle Peter.

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

I'm sorry.

Claudia.


Si Signora.

Can you get uncle Peter a hanger please?

Of course Signora.

And Claudia, make sure that the meat

is not from one of ours.

Sure.

Hey bring him some veal. (Chuckling)

(blowing raspberries)

Father?

I though you might like something to eat.

Only if you're feeling up to it though.

That's fine, I'll just leave it there.

Edgar Allan Poe?

Of course, I'd be delighted.

"From childhood's hour I have not been"

"As others were I have not seen"

"As others saw I could not bring"

"My passions from a common spring"

"From the same source I have not taken"

"My sorrow I could not awaken"

"My heart to joy at the same tone"

"And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone"

"Then, in my childhood in the dawn"

"Of a stormy life was drawn"

"From ev'ry depth of good and ill"

"The mystery that binds me still."

(pitter-patter)

Father, do you hear that?

Your guardian angels,
they're sent to protect you.

(pop music)



I'm just thinking.

What are you thinking about?

A lot of things.

Like what?

Like, maybe going to college.

College?

Yeah.

Don't be ridiculous.

Mom, I'm 18 years old.

I'm smart enough, aren't I?

I wanna go to college.

Baby I know how old you are,
and yes, you're smart enough,

of course you're smart enough,
but that's not the point.

You don't have to go to
college to get an education,

you can get an education right here.

I'll bring in teachers, we can get tutors.

That's not my point, okay?

I wanna go out and I wanna see the world,

and I wanna meet people.

It's not like you don't have the money.

You can send me to any
college that you wanted to.

I don't think that's a very good idea.

Not a good idea for me or for you?

What's that supposed to mean?

I think that you want
to keep me here forever.

You don't wanna stay here?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I just wanna go out
and I wanna see people.

Yeah but people are just trouble.

They are, they're just trouble.

What's wrong with a little
trouble every now and then?

You're so much like
your grandmother, you are.

You're so, you're full of spirit.

Don't be sad mom.

You know, when I was a little girl,

the circus came to the village,

and your grandma, she was
obsessed, she was captivated,

absolutely captivated, it was amazing.

So amazing and so
captivated that she ran away

and never came back.

Yeah?

When I was a teenager,
the circus came back through

and your grandma, she was on the trapeze.


It was amazing, she was
flying around, it was magic.

She never came back.

Did you say hi to her?

But why didn't she come back?

I don't know.

Is that why I never met her?

Your grandpa and I, we were so sad.

Just like your father and I
would be so sad if you left.

But I would come back.

You wouldn't come back.

What?

What is this?

Just my iPod.

An iPod?


And where did you get an iPod?

The village.

The village?

When did you go to the village?

Mom, I didn't go to the village.

Then how did you get it?

I got it from one of the
delivery boys when they came here

A boy gave it to you?

It's just music.

Please, listen.

(pop music)

Okay, you know what,
that's just racket for me.

It is, we have music
right here at the castle.

Yeah, it's wonderful if
you like funeral music.

This music's alive.

It has a pulse, I love it.

You know what?

You better not let your father
catch you with that thing.

I mean it, it'll be
downstairs again for you.

Dad needs to chill.

Dad needs to chill?

What is chill?

It means relax.

It means relax?

been using it for years...

Well, I don't care, I don't like it.

I don't like it, it's undignified.

You know what Naomi?

As Arkoffs, we do things
our own way, okay?

Some people think we're different,

I would like to think that we're unique.

Unique rhymes with freak.

(dramatic music)


Yes?

Good morning, is the man
or woman of the house in?

I am sorry, we do not accept visitors.

I apologize that we didn't call first,

but I couldn't find your phone number.

No phone.

I see, well it's very...



No visitors.

Hey hey, I'm Naomi, I'm Naomi.

Oh hi Naomi.
Come in, come in.

Alright thanks.

Ma Signora.


I'm Kimi Evans, my
associates and I have been

staying in Rome and we're very
interested in your castle.

It's magnificent.

You see, I'm a producer and I...

A producer?

Yes, movie producer from Los Angeles.

Los Angeles?

You mean like Hollywood?

The same, this is our
producer here in Italy,

L.J. Rambouli, and this is
our director, Jensen Curry.

It's very nice to meet you.

This will be Jensen's first
feature and we're pretty

excited about it, aren't we L.J.?

Yeah, it's very excited.

Jensen's on a lot of
music videos, Green Day,

the Jonas Brothers, 50 Cent.

Really?

I like music.

Me too.

Naomi, is your mother or father home?

They're around someplace.

You can go ahead and tell
me, 'cause I'm old enough.

Okay, well like I say,
we're producing a new movie,

set here in Italy and we've
been scouting locations.

L.J. hears about your castle
from some of the villagers

and we think it would make a great set.

You mean like shooting a movie here?

Well, yes part of it, you see it's...

You see, it's a World
War Two spy thriller.

Now our hero gets dropped
behind enemy lines on a plot

to kill Mussolini, and
posing as a village baker,

he sneaks into the dictators
kitchen in order to carry out...

Oh that sounds damned exciting.

We don't care much for movies around here.

Dad.

You're Mr. Arkoff, we wanted
to meet you, I'm Kimi Evans.

My daughter has gotten
a little ahead of herself

and forgotten the family rules.

We don't take to strangers.

I am sorry that we
didn't call first, but,

like I told Naomi, we couldn't
find your phone number.

Apology accepted, now you
can all turn around and go.

Dad, just listen to
what they have to say.

I have heard enough.

a World War Two movie.

Yeah about a baker, I heard.

But we don't want any movies shot here.

I don't need a bunch of
people stomping around

and leaving their garbage everywhere.

I assure you, we'll
leave the castle ground

in immaculate condition.

The castle grounds are exactly
the way I want them to be,

so thanks anyway, but no thanks.

There would be a
considerable cash compensation

for you and your family.

We don't need your money.

Now I'm sure you can all find your way

down the hill from here.

There's a little hotel down there.

It's not up to your standards, I'm sure,

but at least they have beds.

Sir, maybe if you heard just a little...

Peter will show you to the door.

Door, this direction.

Well okay then, if you change your mind,

this has my cell number
on it, you can call any...

Why did you have to be so mean to them?

You're so embarrassing.

Don't you talk to me that way, Naomi.

(apprehensive music)

(apprehensive music)

Grandpa, are you awake?

Do you want me to read to you?

I know you're probably
surprised I'm asking.

Okay.

You dropped your cookie.

Hey grandpa?

I know how you are about having strangers,

but it just seems that mom
and dad just wanna keep me

here forever, and when
you were young didn't you

wanna go out and just see the world?

Now these people are from Hollywood,

and one of them, Jensen, he was so nice.

Don't tell mom that I told you that.

I don't wanna be here forever,

and one day you're gonna be gone,

mom's gonna be gone, dad's gonna be gone.

Who's gonna be there for me?

Grandpa?

Can you please just talk to
mom and dad and just, please?

Pretty please just at least
have them stay for dinner?

If you do I promise I will
read to you every day,

I'll do anything you want.

Grandpa, please.

Please just think about it.

I love you.

(apprehensive music)


I got it Claudia.

Okay.

Ciao.

Hey, hey can I use your cellphone?

Thanks you, grazie.


Here you go little guys.

Hey Jensen, you look so beautiful.

I like it when you touch me like that.

(piano music)

Very nice, bravo Peter.


Ah yes, Claudia I got it.

Okay okay, yes.

Come in, so glad that you could make it.



It's just so great that you're here.

We were surprised to get
the call, especially after

the way your father kicked us out of here.

Oh don't mind him, he needs to chill.

Come on, right this way.

(piano music)

Wow, everything looks so nice Naomi.

Thank you, Claudia is
fixing you something special,

I hope you like it, come on.

I'm sure we'll love it.

Miss Evans, you sit here, you there.

Mr. Curry, you sit here, next to me.

Just call me Jensen, please.

Okay, Jensen.

(apprehensive music)

What the devil's going on?

We are having guests for dinner daddy.

I can see that, who invited them?

If there's a problem we can leave.

Everything is cool.

Everything's not cool.

Carver don't be ridiculous,
these are our guests.

Sweetheart, the table looks beautiful.

Oh, thanks mom, I love you.

You knew about this?

Of course I did, who do
you think invited them?

Daddy, why don't you sit down?

Claudia's fixing your favorite.

I told you, nothing good
can come from outsiders.

Dad, we're the outsiders.

Don't you backtalk me girl.

Not in front of company.

Sorry.

What's that you're wearing?

Looks like your showing
a lot of skin to me.

Waiting for the fleet to come in.

Carver, be quiet, you're being foolish.

(upbeat piano music)

Peter.

(dramatic music)

She's three hours late for recall time,

she finally shows up at the
studio with her whole posse

like 20 people, she spends
an hour in hair and makeup,

then rips the head off of
some poor PA because her water

was too cold, she shows up
on set, she does one take

and then leaves.

I had no choice but to use them.

Hollywood sounds so
exciting, doesn't it daddy?

Bunch of spoiled
sissies, overpaid babies,

none of them worth a flying fuck.

Oh Carver, don't be obstreperous.

I'm sure the business has its charms.

You don't look like a producer to me L.J.

As far as I know,
producers sit behind desks

and make phone calls to lackeys.

You however, you look like a
man that's has his fair share

of hard honest work.

You think so?

Um, Mr. Arkoff, I'm sure
we can work something out

to your satisfaction, I mean
in terms or a rental fee

for your property, you
just name your terms

and I'll have our lawyers
write up a contract.

Told you before, no
movie is shooting here.

Come on daddy.

Don't start with me again girl,

or you're gonna take
another trip downstairs.

(distant hooting)

What's that?

Those are the protectors.

They protect the castle from evil.

Nothing but pests.

Daddy, grandpa says they're
been around for 200 years.

Your grandpa is disturbed in the head.

The protectors?

An old Italian legend
referring to elementals.

Some call them skull heads.

You see, the Romans
used to bury their dead

in underground catacombs.

We were told that there
might actually be tombs

somewhere under this castle.

Isn't that cool?

When the Ostrogoths
and Vandals sacked Rome

they violated the catacombs
searching for valuables.

The skull heads are creatures
born from witchcraft

and they were put here to protect the dead

from just such violation.

Don't worry, they only show themselves

to the face of true evil.

It's said that they have
the power to bring life

and to take it, to bring the
dead back from the grave.

It's amazing, huh?

I'm sure there's a
lot of interesting stuff

about this castle, huh?

I'm sure there are, I don't suppose we

could have a quick tour?

Yes, I would love to take you.

I mean, if that's okay
with you, Mr. Arkoff?

If we can't shoot our film here, maybe

a tour would give Jensen some ideas?

We could replicate certain rooms

on the sound stage if we need to.

Please daddy, please,
please, please, please,

please daddy, please, please,
please, pretty, pretty,

pretty, pretty, pretty please, please...

Aw hell, I suppose.

Thank you.

This doesn't get you off the hook.

You're still due for a trip downstairs.

Okay, come on.

It was a lovely meal Mrs. Arkoff.

The risotto was lumpy.

Peter, keep an eye on 'em.

Claudia?

Yes?

The risotto was lumpy.

It was unacceptable this evening.

(speaks Italian)

That woman, I swear I
don't know why you hired her.

What was it you called me earlier?

Obste, obsetri, aba,
obste, obstetri, obste...

Obstreperous.

Oh yeah, I love it when
you use big words huh?

I know, I know.

Such a turn-on.

(dramatic music)

of this place is amazing.

Really?

I've lived here my whole
life, so have mom and dad.

So your family's
always owned the castle?

No my great-great-grandfather
was in one of those wars,

over 100 years ago, the
Spanish-American war I think it was,

and he wanted to stay here

and won this castle in a card game.

Really?

Yeah, that's why we speak English.

'Cause he didn't want us to
forget where we came from.

Grandpa's upstairs, he has to stay in bed.

I'm sorry, is he an invalid?

No, he's American.

So these protectors, the
ones your mom was calling

the skull heads.

Yeah.

Have you ever seen them?

They're around.

What like guardian angels or something?

So, do you want to go to the dungeon?

You really have a dungeon?

Of course, come on.

This is the dungeon.

Do you think it'll be cool in the movie?

I really hope my dad lets you film here.

It would be so much fun.

The door is a great
help, more than you know.


Where did all these things come from?

I think from the Spanish
inc or something like that.

You mean inquisition?

it was happening in Italy.

I guess it was happening all over.

for their religious beliefs

Yeah, it's gnarly huh?

Wicked.

This was one of daddy's favorites.

His favorite?

Uh-huh, he uses it
on me when I misbehave.

Wait a minute, you
mean your dad actually

puts you in this thing?

Yeah, he's just doing
what's best for me.

That's sadistic.

It's really, it's not that bad.

Naomi, you can't let him do that to you.

It's not that bad really.

But it's not right.

Look, you shouldn't be treated that way.

(dramatic music)


What the?

The guardian angels.

Smells like fumo.

Visit time is over.

Aw, we're ready uncle Peter.

I'm glad you invited us today.

Me too, really.

(apprehensive music)

It could work?

It's perfect.

You see what they keep in there?

They don't even know, to
them it's just old junk.

The paintings, the tapestries,
the pottery alone is worth

at least 300 thousand.

Can we move it?

I know a fance In Rome who
can get it off our hands.

What's his percentage?

Not too bad, but he can
unload it to collectors

much faster than we ever could.

When do we go in?

What's wrong with tomorrow night?

Okay, but nobody gets hurt.

Don't tell me you have a soft spot

for that little piece of pie in there.

Look, we can get in and
out without anyone seeing us.

There's not gonna be
a reason to hurt them.

But if they see us...

They won't see us.

But if they do and
you don't have the guts

to do what needs to be done, I'll do it.

Good morning Signora.

Yes, it is a good morning, isn't it?

Oh yeah, your breakfast is ready.

Thanks you so much Claudia.

Mmm, it looks so good.

Hey Claudia?

Yes?

Did you see that guy last night, Jensen?

Ah, he's so nice isn't he?


(pop music)

Eat up girl, eat all your breakfast.

No, no, no, no.

That breakfast is the only
food you're gonna get today.

You're going downstairs and you know

there's no meals down there.

Because of an iPod?

Because you let strangers into the house

when I told you not to.

They were nice.

Nothing good can come from
strangers, I told you that.

Mom said it was okay.

Your mamma thinks it's okay to put out

cookies for the leprechauns.

It's what I say that
counts, don't you forget it.

Eat your fill, 'cause
you're going downstairs.

(crying, screaming)

I hate you.

Peter.

Peter, (yelling in Italian)

You animal, get off of her.

Get off of her.

She's not here to
pleasure your puny pecker.

Get out of here, make yourself useful.

Go to the pull and fuck the livestock.

Dummy.

Thank you Mr. Arkoff.

Where do you think you're going?

(dramatic music)

There's still a couple of lights on.

Maybe they keep some on, but
they must be in bed by now.

That family of weirdos, who knows?

Maybe they stay up all
night like vampires.

Alright look, I want
you guys to promise me

that when we get in there
we're not gonna hurt anyone.

I told you, unless we need to.

Look, we keep these
on, they're not gonna

be able to tell who we are,

so there's not gonna
be a need to hurt them.

You think they're that stupid?

What?

Three strangers visit them,
and the very next night their

castle gets robbed, even those
stupidos can figure it out.

Unless we're spotted by the skull heads.

[L.J.] The skull heads,
I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

I can't believe you
can keep a straight face

while talking to her about that shit.

That's one stupid little girl

you've got your eye on my friend.

I don't have my eye on her,
alright, and she's not stupid.

If you say so.


Whatever you say boss.

Alright, let's go.
Let's go.

goodnight to father?


You know how he likes
when you visit him.

He doesn't even know I'm there.

That's not true, of course he does.

I didn't see Naomi in her
room before I retired.

Don't tell me you still have
her trussed up downstairs.

Gotta do something
to maintain discipline.

Brat's out of control.

Carver, you're becoming
obsessively obtuse.

You know how those bug words turn me on.

Can you please table
your prurient interests

for two minutes while we have

a civilized tet-a-tete about our daughter?

Oh man, you've got a filthy mouth.

Can you not sense my reticence?

Does this mean the
barn doors are closed?

Yes Carver, in your neolithic
world, that's what it means.

Alright, I'll go down after
a while and let her out.

Wasn't gonna have her stay
down there all night anyway,

if that's what you're worried about.

She's not like us Caver,
she's not like you and me,

she's a free spirit, she's like mother.

And I'm fearful she may not
be much longer in this house.

Like hell.

You know, your disciplinary
actions will only

serve to hasten her departure.

She's not going anywhere,

not while I have anything to say about it.

Well, don't be so
sure of that sweetheart.

Carver, Carver, I hear something.

Everything feels fine to me.

No, there's something
wrong with this house.

Oh, one of your spooky feeling again?

You know what, you
know I can sense things,

don't poke fun at me.

Okay, how about I just poke you?

Oh Carver, you're incorrigible.

What do we do?

We work around him,
we've done it before.

Look, he's sleeping off a drunk.

He won't be awake for hours.

Okay, grab whatever you can carry

and stack it by the rear doors.

Once we're loaded up, we go.

Jensen, you go down to the basement,

we saw some good stuff down there.

Why me?

What? Don't tell me you're scared.

Carver, Carver wake up.

What?

Something's wrong.

What?

Something wrong, I can hear something.

Something's wrong in this house.

You said that before, one
of your spooky feelings,

your fifth sense?

Sixth sense.

Yeah, that too.

No, I'm serious, this time
I think I heard something.


Dad, dad.

Naomi.

Jensen, what are you doing here?

Why are you dressed like that?

It's not important.

Oh it's all black, you look so sexy.

Who put you in this
thing, did your dad do this?

Of course, I told you it's
what happens when I misbehave.

But it's not right.

I told you, it's just
the way we do things.

We need to get you out of here, okay?

There's still more in the dining room.

The retard's still asleep?

Like a dead fish, if he
wakes up I'll handle him.

Alright, I'll clear out
the stuff near the stairs,

by then Jensen should be done
and we can get out of here.

Come on.

Thank you so much.

We need to get out of here, okay?

Okay.

Come on.
Okay.


Well, so much for your fifth sense dear.

Everything looks as normal as always.

Oh yeah, and what about that?

What about it?

Where's the vase that goes on top of it?

Damn.

Honey.

What the hell?

Jensen says that I
shouldn't be treated that way.

He says that I deserve better,
isn't that sweet of him?

Hey Jensen, will you take
me to Hollywood with you?

Girl, this guy doesn't
give a rats ass about you.

He's just here to rip us
off, him and his partners.

Where are they, huh?

Jensen, is that true?

No, not all of it,
look, I don't want you

to have to stay here if
you don't want to, okay?

You're so sweet.

Like it's up to her
whether she comes or goes.

She's old enough to
make up her own mind.

She's an Arkoff, she
belongs here with us.

Mom, I have to leave, I
can't stay here forever.

I understand that sweetheart,

but we've had this conversation before.

We're family, remember?

This is a special family,
we have to stick together.

Jensen she's right.

You see Mr. Curry,
when it comes to family,

we're very, very close, closer than most.

What are you talking about?

Naomi, she's not only my
daughter, she's also my niece.

What do you mean?

Carver and I, we're not man and wife,

we're brother and sister.


You mean you two,

and you?

Naomi understands, she can't leave us,

she wouldn't do well out in the world.

Just because I have
to stay in the castle

doesn't mean that you can't be with me.

Naomi, I'm sorry.

You're not leaving either.


Mamma.

You didn't have to shoot her.

Of course I did, you
idiot, they can identify you,

they can identify us.

You bitch.





You weren't supposed to kill them.

They saw us, I told
you what would happen.

Besides, they were sick fucks,
brother and sister doing it?

And she's the retarded inbred daughter.

You really know how to pick 'em buddy.

Naomi, I'm sorry.

Dad was right, you're
not from Hollywood.

Duh.

You just wanted to steal from us.

I didn't want this, Naomi no one was...

You're lying.


Go.

This is all very sweet, but
it's time to say goodbye now.

I warned you what would happen.

No.

That's the way you wanna play huh?

I told you you're not gonna hurt her.

Are you here to protect me?

You really care about me, don't you?

Alright, let's go both of you, come on.

Go, go.

(apprehensive music)

Come on.

Kimi don't do this.

Hey honey, why don't you do me a favor

show me how your daddy straps
you in that thing over there.

Okay.



Don't worry.

Let's go.

Kimi don't do this.

Shut the fuck up.

Naomi this isn't a game.

Okay, there.

Great, go over here, c'mon
c'mon, let's go over here, go.

Hey Jensen don't worry about it,

it's not gonna hurt that much, okay?

You can watch.


I don't like partners who go against me.


The last partner who went
against me, you know what I did?

I buried him in concrete.

You know what they built
on top of that concrete?

A police station.

Cops have been looking for
that douchebag for two years

and he's right under their fucking noses.

That's funny.

Hey your retarded girlfriend
has a sense of humor.

Let's see if she thinks this is a riot.

Dad never uses that button.

I'll send flowers to your grave.

No, no, no, no, no, Jensen, Jensen stop.

Jensen, Jensen, help, help me.

L.J. what happened?

I don't know, got hit on the head.

Must have been the big dummy.

C'mon, Jensen's out, let's
get the shit and get going.

Let's go.

(doors creaking)


No, Jensen, Jensen, no, no, no, no.

No, stop, no, Jensen.

Uncle Peter, uncle Peter there,

uncle Peter, help Jensen,
help, no, no, no, no

not me, not me, no, help Jensen,

help Jensen

No, he's not, he
saved my life, help him.

Help him, stop the machine,

uncle Peter please, please, turn it off,

c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

Are you okay?

I'm so glad you're okay.

C'mon, we need to get out of here.


Come on, come on, let's get out of here.

Come on, let's go.

Going somewhere?


We told you we don't take to strangers.

I'm afraid you should
have heeded his warning.



Claudia, you've
under-cooked the meat tonight.

Unacceptable.

Carver, don't be so boorish and uncouth.



Jesus,

Kimi and L.J. they must have
hidden the bodies, but why?

I gotta go check on grandpa.

Naomi, no.

I'm not leaving out grandpa.


Grandpa, I'm so glad that
you're okay, I was so worried.

Naomi c'mon, we have to go.

Naomi c'mon.


Holy shit.

What's wrong?

Naomi, he's dead.


Naomi he's been dead for
years, he's a fucking mummy.

You don't listen to him.

Jensen, grandpa and I have been talking,

we think it's really sweet that you

wanna take me away from here,

really I do, but I'm an Arkoff,

and us Arkoffs must stick together.

Naomi I...

I can't leave this castle,
it just wouldn't be right.

Naomi, I'm still willing
to take you with me,

listen to me, Naomi listen
to me, listen to me,

look you have to get out of
this castle, you need help.

You and I are like Romeo and Juliet,

but grandpa knows best.


Don't worry grandpa.

(dramatic music)

Holy shit.



You tried to take our
little girl from us.

My innocent Naomi.

Don't bother Carver.

He'll get away.

No he won't, I have his keys.




(slow eerie music)


we have to stick together.

When it comes to family, we're very close.

Closer than most.

You're too hard on her,
she's only a teenager.

Not hard enough, I say.


she's a free spirit.

I wanna go out, and
I wanna see the world

and I wanna meet people.

we do things our own way.

Some people think we're different,

I would like to think that we're unique.

Unique rhymes with freak.


interesting stuff about this castle.

Something's wrong, I can hear something,

something's wrong in this house.

Those are the protectors,
they protect the house from evil

The protectors?

An old Italian legend,
referring to the elementals,

some call them skull heads.

Creatures born from witchcraft.

It's said that they have
the power to bring life

and to take it, to bring the
dead back from the grave.
