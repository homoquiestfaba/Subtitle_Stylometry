The Lovely Bones

I remember being really small.

<i>... too small to see
over the edge of a table.</i>

there is a snow globe.

And I remember the penguin
who lived inside the globe

He was all alone in there
and I worried for him.

don't worry, Kiddo
He has a nice life.

He's trapped in the perfect world.

The Lovely Bones

look at that, Susie Q.

TWELVE YEARS LATER.

<i>I remember being given a camera
for my birthday.</i>

<i>I love the way, a photo
could capture a moment.</i>

<i>Before it was gone.</i>

<i>That's what i wanted to be
when i grew up...</i>

<i>'A wild-life photographer'</i>

Sorry, mom.

<i>I imagined that,
when i'll be older I'll be tracking wild elephants
and rhinos.</i>

<i>But, for now, I'd have
to make deal with Grace Tarking.</i>

<i>Its strange the memories you keep</i>

<i>I remember going with dad
to the sink-hole out at the Connor's farm.</i>

<i>it was something about the way
the earth could swallow things whole</i>

<i>And I remember the girl who lived there.
Ruth Connors.</i>

<i>the kids at our school said
she was weird,</i>

<i>and know i know and see
those things other didn't.</i>

Ready?
One, two, three!

<i>And i remember the worst thing
that ever happened to us as a family,</i>

Somebody help!
Mom?

Where are you?
Mom?

oh god

Dad?

<i>The day my little brother
stopped breathing.</i>

Buckley!

What happened?
He has swallowed a twig.

WatchOut!

Are you crazy?
Sorry!

Buckley.

You're okay...

And I remember the light in my
parents eyes. the relief.

<i>we weren't those people...</i>

<i>... those unlucky people, to whom
bad things happened for no reason.</i>

You know the Buddha said,
"If you save someone else's life...

<i>My grandmother predicted me a long and happy life because i'ved saved  my brother.</i>

<i>As usual,
Granma Lynn was wrong.</i>

<i>My name was Salmon, like the fish.
first name Susie.</i>

<i>I was 14 years old when I was murdered,
on December 6, 1973.</i>


<i>this was before missing kids
started to appear on Milk cartons.</i>

<i>Over feature stories
on the daily news.</i>

<i>It was back when people
believed things like that didn't happen.</i>

No matter what size you have,
it's all perfectly.

If you got it...
Hold on, buddy.

Buckley!
Look at this!

That is the m.

Who is he?
Does he like you as much as you like him?

Grandma, He is a seniors.

He does not know I exist.
He's Cute.

Granma, please just drop it!

You're safe.
He is in the record.

<i>I was not safe. A man in
my neighborhood was watching me.</i>

If I was not so distracted, I had
had in mind that something was not right.

Because usually I get chills.

<i>but i was too busy, thinking about
the length of Ray Singh's eyelashes.</i>

<i>I counted each one in library time
while he was reading 'Abelard and Heloise'</i>

<i>the most seriously tragic love story ever</i>

so, have you kissed him ?

Why not? You like him, he likes you,
What's the hold up?

I'm just afraid of the moment I can not.

My first kiss was with grown man.

You not going to tell them, are you?
Of course not.

What was it like?
The kiss? Oh it was wonderful.

beautiful, glorious.

Took me a long time before i realise
that a kiss like that, it only happen just once.

Susie ...

just have fun, kid.

<i>It wasn't Mr. O'Dwyer, by the way.
although, he kinda looks suspicious.</i>

<i>Mr.O'Dwyer,never hurt anyone.</i>

<i>Mr.O'Dwyer's own daughter died
a year and a half after i did.</i>

<i>she had leukemia,
but i never saw her in my heaven.</i>

Hey, look at me!

to my parents about his board of flowers.</i>

Thank you so much

<i>I was aiming for the bushes,
but he got in the way.</i>

And Susie?

We have not found her.

That is good.

He walked through the woods, looking
to rabbits.

Then he sees three. He grabs his gun,

And then a big smoke cloud,
He sees them not.

Then he realizes that his gun
was, he had no more bullets. Then he runs.

You're Salmon girl ? right

Holiday

Grandma, I know where Susie is.

Yeah, Susie is gone to heaven, sweetheart.
Lindsey says there is no heaven.

You will also soon died.
Why do you say that?

Because you're old.

35 is not old. You
that smelled too much polish.

There is also nothing to me.
You know why?

Because  I take my medicine everyday.

Grandma, she is here.

What?
Susie.

Susie is in between.

<i>I was in the blue horizon, between
heaven and earth.</i>

<i>The days were unchanging.</i>

<i>And every night I dreamed
the same dream.</i>

<i>The smell of damn breath. The scream that
no one heard.</i>

<i>The sound of my heart, that if hit
a hammer against a coffin.</i>

<i>And I heard them calling.
The voices of the dead.</i>

<i>I wanted to follow them.
A way out.</i>

<i>But I always came back
the same door.</i>

<i>And I was afraid.</i>

<i>I knew when I went in there ...</i>

<i>I never go outside
would come.</i>

<i>My Murderer could live in
one moment for a long time.</i>

<i>He could feed a memory
over and over again.</i>

<i>He was animal.
Faceless.</i>

<i>infinite.</i>

<i>But then he would feel it.
The emptiness returning.</i>

<i>And would need him again
to emerge.</i>

Go.
Here in?

<i>When summer came he know this young
lovers who cornfield dunk.</i>

<i>He began to follow them. And watched.</i>

Are you coming to bed?

Yes, soon.

Buckley has done.
Yes, he said that our house was ...

This is the police, and this is you.
This is me?

Yes, he has made you chief of police.
I've gained 20 pounds.

That must be uniform.
The danger of a desk job.

I would give up a loss.
Sit down.

i'm living with this every day.
what about your marriage?

What marriage?
Jack sleeps in the den.

You must find a way to go.
You have no choice.

If you can not keep full,
you ... ah, bingo

that's cooking Sherry .
You must find a way to live with this.

live with it? I'm living with this.
you're not

I count them off. So?

You have a tomb in the middle of your house.

Oh sweetheart, do you really think if
you seal it up that the pain gonna go?

My mother went so far as possible.<i></i>

<i>She found a job at a small farm
just outside Santa Rosa.</i>

<i>The work was hard, but
she did not mind.</i>

<i>If anyone asked, she said
she had two children.</i>

Dear Lindsey ...

<i>And Lindsey, who always said
she didn't believe in love.</i>

<i>found it anyway.</i>

<i>And there it was. The moment
I would never know.</i>

<i>My little sister had run ahead of me.</i>

<i>She was growing up.</i>

What is it?
I thought you would be happy.

I'm happy.

I am very happy.

Why are you crying?

You think she did not want to kiss?
No, she did.

She wanted to kiss him very much.

<i>always I would watch Ray.</i>

<i>I was in the air around him.</i>

<i>I was in the cold winter mornings he
spent with Ruth Conner.</i>

<i>That strange other worldly girl ...</i>

<i>so easy the presence
accepted by the dead among the living.</i>

<i>And sometimes thought Ray to me.</i>

<i>But he began to wonder whether the
was time to stop that memory away.</i>

Maybe it was time for me
to let go.

Lindsey, throw it.

Missing girl, Susie Salmon and
sister Lindsey Salmon (right)

<i>My Murderer had finally tuned and stinked.</i>

<i>He knew my sister had begun to wondered
about the solitary man who lived in the greenhouse .</i>

<i>She seemed intend to him
to penetrate.</i>

<i>And he resented it.</i>

<i>He began to feel a familiar itch.</i>

Roles to develop

Mom, look.
For a moment.

Careful, honey.
Mom.

This is a beautiful ...

Mom, look.

Dad, look at me.

Mr. Salmon, hello.

What is that?
A project I'm working on.

Are you a hunter?
Ducks.

That is a blind right?
Yes.

Yes.
Does it really?

Yes.

<i>It's all about concealment
the art of concealment .</i>

And patience.

For hours in the dark.
I love nature.

He had a hole in his head to make.
Lindsey, please.

Did you hear that, Jack?
This example you give to your children.

persecuting the neighbours.
He is not crazy.

I said no.
Why do not you listen to him?

Because you need proof, Lindsey.

You can not accuse George Harvey
if you have no evidence.

You need evidence.
You're pathetic.

Why do not you. You long
ago ceased to her.

# On the floating, shipless, oceans#

# I did all my best to smile #

# till your singing eyes and fingers #

# drew me loving into your eyes.#

# And you sang "Sail to me, sail to me,
Let me enfold you." #

# Here I am, here I am
waiting to hold you. #

# Did I dream you dreamed about me?#

# Were you here when I was full sail?#

# For you sang "Touch me not, touch me not,
Come back tomorrow."#

# Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow.#

It is beautiful.
