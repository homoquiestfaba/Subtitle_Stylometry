Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Almost unprepared, make up by the afternoon of life.

Worse than that. We step with false assumptions

the truths and ideals

How should we serve.

But we could live life afternoon

according to the schedule of morning life.

Because what was great in the morning will become tiny evening.

And what was true in the morning, the evening will become a lie.

Hay House presents:

Dr. Wayne W. Dyer in

From ambition to meaning - Discovering your life purpose

Hey. -Hey. Thank you, dear.

Wait, can you give me some milk?

Sure

Sorry, I have not seen. Thank you

OK, I packed everything, to get some snacks, do not forget Jason's recipe, dog,

machine rate, I called neighbors

Hey, Jack!

Jack

Jack, I need to turn off the game and came down to eat. We will leave shortly.

Mommy, let me just finish this level.

Okay, very good. But then we will disconnect all the weekend, right?

I do not know what "off".

It's a very strange life forms |

Hey, sweetie.

It's time to wake up, baby.

Already it tomorrow?

Yes, it's already tomorrow! And we go on vacation, and we enjoy the most,

But we should avoid traffic, so let! It's time to wake up, monkey.dance!

Ok, up!

Exaggerate, Larry, do not know what they can do.

-Can do more harm your image, Chad. Listen,

of a brand to protect, Dead Development can not afford to have processes

with a group of environmentalists. Ä, lies not simply the right climate for such things.

And what do you propose?

-I suggest you think of a type of compromise or it will lead to court

and you can not start this project at all.

Why did not this happen when I made impact report? In the name of God, it's a tree!

No, it's more than a tree.

Chad, your sales drop and now you feel that you are insensitive.

Are insensitive, it's a tree!

Me esta costando ¡³ n Dinero a mount ..

-You know what, Larry, talk about it after-

Wait a minute ..

Minute charge me, I now close .-

Not yet ...

About what was all this?

Are falling by 80% to commission approval.

Why can not you simply do not build near the tree?

Because I lose money and you do not receive your bonus.

I will not reconfigure a whole section because of a tree.

No matter, then.

Have you taken any decision in relation to the board meeting at the weekend that the Monterrey?

Wait, what it is?

"House of Hope and Promise"

Ah, next time someone asks me to be in one of these boards, shoot me!

Jhonson Hugh will be there, remember?

I turned on one relationship that you may ask to participate.

Yes, yes, if Hugh Jhonson is on the board would do well to be myself.

In case you forgot, in rehabilitation centers of the House of Hope

families are homeless.

I have put all the information in this file.

You can put yourself up to date about their mission in the car on the road.

I already know what is their mission: to give them a helping hand to those who can not help themselves.

You know what? I am not one no hand stretched out and I did well.

I'll call and I will suggest your journalists to say something about your charity work.

Yes, this really is a good idea.

I'll deviate from the whole problem with this tree.

That's what I thought too.

...

Wait!

Good! Yes? What happened?

You hear a little hard.

The reception is not good up here.

What do you mean by "reconsider her"?

Are you kidding, is not it?

Though my agent ...

-Too violent? And that means even you?

No, I do not make movies odious,

I make horror movies, you must convince them that.

They know even as we invested in that talent?

Ah, you have to find a way to make ...

Look, he appeared directly in the eyes looked at me,

and said: "This is a project of gold, I want to make your film"

Yes! Because if money does not come we will have

many problems trying to find another investor.

I thought it was something safe - I beg your pardon, you see that pass.

Want to make me happy? Do get money for my film,

That would make me happy.

I have to go, are in this thing with Wayne Dyer. Pa.

Wow, damn!

It's something we can do?

You, more or less, 5 million?

If I had it I would be here?

Then I do not think you can help me.

Cheer up David, it's a good job, it's fast! It's fast and fun.

It's 6.30 am, Sarah, will not be fun.

It's just a job.

One or two questions, we draw some pictures and then get out of here ..

Wayne!

Good morning, David! - What are you doing? - Great!

I hope it's not too early for you.

Oh no! I'm awake for hours.

Okay, okay! He is Rob, our cameraman, we very lucky to have.

Ron, sound technician.

Hi, Ron! Pleased to meet you.

And it is Sarah, my coordinator production, full of resources.

If you need anything, just ask for them!

-Very well.

So if you do not mind, I thought we could turn

area by more social and we set there.

Sure, I'm ready. I am ready for a few hours.

Ok, take your coat and go.

Super! -

After you, Doc. Well, how did you sleep?

-I slept very well, we are very excited that this is

Oh, you have no expectation that I should know?

I have no hold. Are entirely in your hands, whatever you want to do ...

Oh, I'm sorry for you, Dr. Dyer.

I'm sorry you said it ..

I just want to cover a little here, otherwise your head will shine.

You can not go wrong with this place, it's not nice?

It is beautiful here.

I'm kind of allergic to nature.

Oh, I love her. I am so excited to be here.

It seems well .- Several trees, fewer trees, how do you find?

Sure, it's good.

Do you know anything about the history of this place? You searched some information somewhere?

Not really, just go where we send, you know?

Leading this place is a fascinating guy,

History of the place told me ...

-I can not hear-

... Is truly a magical place and ..

-Can you say that again? Excuse

I said it was magical, a magical place

I hear, I hear-.

In 1913, Julia Morgan, an architect,

-AHA-

She thought the whole complex design.

He was conceived as a conference center for the Division

Western YWCA and they held their meetings here all.

And the name of the place is "Asilomar"

Who knows what Asilomar? And I asked and said to me:

"Asilio Asilo or refuge means" apple "means the sea"

Look, if we can start.

That's interesting, you heard, David?

I heard, yes.

Ä, be it a refuge by the sea, is, is simply stunning, so beautiful,

-Great-

are so excited to be here.

Wayne, just to know, tomorrow and tomorrow you will have to ask ..

and you will answer,

and then we will change locations and do the same thing again.

And also, we will shoot something for Part B, in the following days.

Would you like a bee? (Pun)

Yes, part B, the film ..

Bees .. shoot bees?

Listen, it's your vision, I am open to anything.

Whatever what you see, I am happy to go on your idea.

Well, rather I am a technician in the present.

Seriously? Well, you know what? Maybe you learned something.

Maybe .. Well, I'm open to that.

Great!

Ahh .. You can start and to start the camera.

We are ready.

The sound is good.

Very well, Sarah, you can be nice and let us cut?

I would like more

I will crop?

I'll cut in Regulation

Dr. Dyer, an interview.

Okay, Wayne, you came up here to write your last book.

Can you tell us something about the subject of this book?

Yes, I would like. One of the things that
I was intrigued over the years

is that so many people say when I talk about the purpose

and about finding meaning in their life is ..

"What is my purpose? How can I find?

I always seem to escape, it seems that I'll never find .. "

I always felt that the true purpose of life

just to be happy, to enjoy your life.

To arrive in a place where ...

... Do not always try to go elsewhere.

So many people spend their lives struggling, trying to be

in a place where there are. It seems that they never get there.

One of the forms to understand how to find your

Your purpose in life is to go back to nature.

To find your own nature.

I wrote a book several years ago called:

Change your thoughts, change your life!

based on the teachings of Lao Tzu's ancient,

from a book called the Tao Te Ching.

Lao Tzu reminds us that all the being of existence has its origin

Jesus said such in the New Testament:

It is the spirit that gives life

you did not really come from your parents,

that we all came from this place called Spirit.

That when you came into this world,

have emerged from a tiny drop of human protoplasm.

A grain, if you want. And everything in that little grain

You became. Everything you needed was in that little grain.

One of the most important metaphors
you've ever used is

that the first nine months of your life, from conception of your

your birth until everything was arranged for you.

There was nothing to do for you. You should not concern
thinking about what color your eyes will be,

or how you show your body. They take care of everything.

You just quit. I call it the pillar of the future.

And you shoot, you pull in the direction

it is supposed to be.

And I did not seem exaggerated to say that everything you needed for your physical journey

was already set in there.

And then why not the rest of the journey, too?

Your goal is in there.

Everything you your personality is in there.

All that is to be, not only physical self, but everything.

If you just leave and permits.

And so we are born.
And look at this beautiful little creature, as parents,

I have eight children, I saw this many times-

and look at this beautiful little boy, you look and say:

Great job, O Lord, great job. He could not be better

We take care from now on

And then we are surrounded by all these people,
Our family, our culture wherever we go.

And begins to be told

that we can not really trust what we are.

We must trust in something outside ourselves

and travel to this ambition. And once you start to say:

We take care from now on, enter something ..

simply take this .. perfection

and out of the way the Creator, (Edge God Out).

E G A ego

The ego is part of us that told us he

Is not that who you are created perfect, divine,
piece of God that you came.

Do not say that. We say: you are what you have.

Start with things like our toys and our bank accounts and then

and then in our possession possessions. Before we realize

begin to identify ourselves
based on our possessions.

We begin to have a set of beliefs such as:

The more I have, the more valuable are the person

And so we waste the lives of these young children taking

and throwing them in a culture
which focuses on .. MORE.

Becomes almost a mantra of ego:

You must have more. And the more you have,

are much more aware of how others
want to take what you have.

The more you eat of: How to protect what we have?

and How to do more of what I?

The dilemma here is that if you are what you

and things disappear,

then what you are disappearing at the same time.

Going somewhere?

Yes, I thought I could come with you.

Why?

Why not?

Because that's the job of service.
I'll be in meetings all day tomorrow

not gonna have nothing to do.

No matter if you're busy, we will go
shopping or something. I'll handle it.

Good! Sorry, you will not need you after all.
Thank you leave.

What are you doing?

Come on! It will be beautiful walk away.
The machine to take?

Not living and do not want to drive. I want someone to lead
because I have work to do.

Ok, I'll lead me.

Take the Porsche!

Denise, where work is not the kind of
place which are ordinary rustic.

I think I can handle this, Chad. I know to cope with difficult situations.

You know, just do not understand the sudden desire
to spend time together.

I just want to escape.

Would you rather I take a separate room?

Ok, what's not okay with you?

Or interrupt something ..

Oh, come on!

You meet someone there?

Of course not! Look, I do not want to go to this thing.

Well, then .. yet another reason why you should go with you.

No bags to lump all those in Porsche.

Why not help me to try?

The second aspect of the ego that is the idea that
not only what we have, but what they are

We ..

An answer?

No, no. Please continue!

It's okay, no problem.

Dr. Dyer, want some water or something?

No, no, well ..

One more movie friends. Stop, or what?

Continue to shoot, still shooting.

Please.

So that .. the second component of the ego is not only the idea that

I am what I am, but that is what they do.

And what is this thing called making do.

And in all this world that I think are
what do we consume the whole idea that this

my success, my worth, my merit as human beings
is based on how many are.

So you have to make more money, you need to get a promotion, have to compete with everyone

trying to get what I am.
It teaches us that continually;

teach our young people learn that when I go to athletics,

The most important thing you can do
is to be number one

And you see we are number one, we are better than any other.

And we consistently found in this notion
competitive again, to believe

that our world is a place where they must compete.
That is what the ego says.

Now, the third aspect is the idea that
are what others think about me.

This is .. is my reputation.

This is particularly relevant for
young people were taught that must

to dress as I think others.
And if others do not like you

then something is wrong with you. And if you eat
with all these things, then you have something different every time

when you return. Now, this is particularly
relevant to women.

And especially their relationship with the family.
Women are often taught in our culture

in our society that the only way you can
to self-realize you is by how you relate to your family,

to you as a daughter, mother to you, to you as a grandmother.

And while they are very important and creative aspects of life of every woman, if this is the choice you make,

represents not necessarily the only solution.

And many women feel their depth
that have a calling to do something great,

to contribute. And often leaves aside.
So what I encourage them to think women are:

Do not ignore that call within you!

Do not ignore that part of you that says:
"You come here to create something important."

And you just so much influence in this, so much as a right to do so, like everyone else has.

Sure, I saw myself on that.

Do you think I could get the entire collection on DVD?

I think it could be a possibility.

Do you know which is my favorite episode?

No, I do not know.

Hit the box!

Ä, be it a good one.

You know, when all the elders become young again.

Yes, yes, it is touching, is not it?

You know? Another episode that I like is when ..

Lord, I would like .. I login,

Oh, oh, I'm sorry!

Welcome to the wedding?

Ahh .. not

It's a wedding? World even married here?

Yes, all the time.

Do not criticize, I think it's

delightful.

Chad Mort.

Development Dead?

Yes?

Ethan Lipton

I worked for your company.

Oh, sure, yes.

Accounting.

Yes, sure.

Honey, talk later, ok?

Ok.

Oh, make sure you tell the boys to appear
on time tomorrow night at the rehearsal dinner.

Also this weekend will be a continuous celebration of love.

Oh, I love love

Well .. of this are in this business .. Goodbye!

Next to marry?

Oh, no. I'm with the band.

Oh, well. Have a fun weekend .. of love.

And you, too!

Remember that guy?

Not at all.

Hello

Hey, look, I login, the House .. something ..

-Promise and hope-

Promise ..

Chad Mort, are driving.

Welcome to Asilomar, Mr. Mort.

We have rooms with views to the north,
out the door and turn left ..

Yes, my wife accompanied me suddenly, so that ..
I could have one of the larger rooms?

Do not have to say that ..

Well, do not expect, you came unexpectedly ..

-Only one of the nicest rooms would be great. Thank-.

Not used the tent.

Haha, camping ..

That was funny.

Let me see what I can do for you

There are so many things you can do.

Oh, that would be super.

-Chris, where are the children? -

Ethan!

Jack, Ethan, come here!

Come.

Come!

Go here!

Be careful, soldiers

Come, go to the mother.

And .. also something away from all the noise would be good ..

We have a 1st floor room in the main building.

Something above.

Of course, Mr. Mort. You have a room on the 2nd floor.

Higher than that, please? ..

I'm afraid this is the highest of what we have here.

Are you kidding. What a waste of space property.

I think you will like this room has balcony.

Sure, if you say ..

One moment please ..

Give it your mother, give it your mother, one hurt.

I said that we will disconnect all the weekend.

Want to go home?

No, go home, not fun at all.
Come here, stay with me!

Come, jump on my feet. Jump on your feet .. Ok-

It is impossible to have all meetings
with all these children running and screaming.

Have a pleasant stay!

Look, I do not want to wear this conversation now
Do not have time for this.

I can not worry about that.

We then went to the later parts of the ego,
we talk about something called separation.

The ego has a very strong belief system,
they who are separated from everyone else.

And then another component of the ego teaches us
you are also separated from all that I miss

in my life and everything I would love to have.

And then, finally, ego teaches us
error most scandalous of all.

It teaches us that .

are separated from God.

And one of the simple concepts that you learn
afternoon of your life when you move

the end stage of your life is to realize

you came from a source. We can call God,
can we call it Tao, call no matter how.

And that this source is everywhere. There is a place not to be.

Must be, because it creates. Everything comes from this source

And then you have to be me
If there is any place that is not.

It must be me.

And if they are to me, must also be in any
I think missing from my life.

If you know it, then, somehow, with all that's missing from your life and you would like to have

are already connected in spirit. And all you have to do is
to figure out a way where you align yourself

with this and have held understanding that you are already connected,
that only need to bring everything on its path.

-This is intense! -

Wow, I said it out loud?

Yes, you just say it loud.

Sorry.

It's all right, is intense.

Nor doubt.

Please continue!

Ok, I said that as we move
afternoon to life

we take the same structures of the ego
I learned that on the morning of our lives.

What are all about competition,
gain, to be better than everyone else.

And try to apply these same structures
afternoon of our lives.

And what happens is that .. ends living a lie.

Because that was really morning
evening became a lie.

The problem is that not really know how
Moving in the end stage of our lives.

Here is where we must learn to ..
we returned to those first nine months

from our conception until birth.

Lao Tzu talks about it in the Tao Te Ching.

Let you lived it!

He says that Tao does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone.

Here is where to go,
at a point where we can give,

And we know that we are not alone, that we will be guided,

We have a nature and that we can trust in this kind.
It is not something that we must fight all the time.

There is something to turn up in our care. Literally, think about it!
That leaves you lived rather than to take you over.

But as we move towards the end stage of our life,

What happens is that we begin to think of
to meet a dharma,

to fulfill a destiny to fulfill
something within us a call,

that we can only feel within ourselves.
Nobody else can tell you is that,

but if you feel and know, to win or to be above the others go on a background

face to feel old and live your life with a purpose.

Coming to get you!

No! Ethan, do not throw sand!

Hey!

Do you drink?

A juice box?

Sure.

I'll be back to get some protective lotion.

Are you sure? It's cloudy ..

No, but he can burn.

Ok, are you doing?

Let me, I'll be quick.

Are you sure?
We may collect.

No, no, look at them, plays the most.
I do not want to interrupt them.

Be right back.

Ok

We have a great material.

Well, I think it was a good start, even was

I think .. I think you see all the work that
tying into some unexpected forms.

You'll be surprised really gonna be.

Directors do not like surprises.

A well .. you'll get a few.

Great.

See you in the morning.

I can not wait Thanks for everything, it was great.

Thank-thee-

Thanks, guys

Hey, Doc, thank you. The pleasure-

See you later

Ok, thanks.

See you tomorrow!

Amazing, is not it?

Yes, it is.

It seems that stretch each other.

Sorry?

Well .. trees,
seems to lie at each other to achieve.

Yes, you're right. So it seems.

Also this place .. looks like a different painting each day.

You know, you are very lucky to work here.

Hey ..
You want a lollipop?

Pardon?

It's rootbeer, rootbeer you like? (A drink)

Actually, yes.

It's rootbeer with a little liquid.

Thank you!

I love it!
I like everything in this place

About what? What do you like here?

I do not know, is
just

is so beautiful that I
.. I can not describe it ..

in words, yes ..

I believe so

I mean ..

words compared to pictures.

Images?

Pictures.

No .. do not make it.

I did it once

When I was in college, I used to get off the beach
and draw for hours.

Oh, well. It does not matter anyway.

Oh, well.

Hey, Mom!

Where were you?

What?

We have made the cold.

Eat a lollipop?

Yes.

Do you have any children?

No, I'm sorry.

Oh, it's all right.

Let's go back!

Let's go. Yes.

All right.

Want of the mother?

Do not catch me, to be honest with you.

This really does not surprise any of us, David.

Seriously. If I had ambition, what would be done?.

Oh, it is assumed that this was a comment about us?

Give me a napkin, please.

You know what I mean ..

We should simply sit
And wait for things to happen to us? Miraculously?

There is nothing wrong in having a bit of magic in life.

You can not trust magic.

In what can I trust is my own will
to make things work.

That is my main problem According to Dr. Dyer.

Ok, it's right there. Want to speak more slowly?

I can not hear.

Dr. Dyer,

Oh, good! -

Want to join us? -Sure! With pleasure! -

What are you doing?

Great!

-Well-

Chicken is great.

Hmm .. good, good.

So
Dr. Dyer ..

Yes?

Just talking

-Yes-

about our first interview
and all the things you said.

And .. In fact, David believes that everything is a mess

What?

David! Really?

I .. I do not think everything is so .. I mean ..
I am entitled to my own opinion, right?

Absolutely! You have the right to own opinion and I respect.

And you know what, David? You should not take everything at once, you know?

Just get better with time, that's all it takes, you know?

As the practice.

Eventually, it becomes a form of life.
Start living from a different perspective.

There are .. really a very spiritual person.
I'm too busy!

Yes, spirituality is like a luxury.

That's true, I find it hard to find time to meditate.

Let me ask you this:
you're a person inspired you?

Live an inspired life? Do you feel inspired?

Hmm .. I have no clue.

Really?

Well, let's let's take an example.

Suppose we had here an apple pie
apple I just did.

And this we take a slice apple pie.

Take this, take the rest of the pie and put it here
and take this piece and give it to someone, say you give it to you, Ron

And you say, Ron, what is this?

Hmm

It is a p..
apple pie?

How do you know that? How do you know that is an apple pie?

Because I came from an apple pie.

So ..

Well, you laugh, but the truth is that
You've made a very profound statement.

That everything in the universe must be like that where it came from.
You can never undo an acorn and
not one to bear a rose bush from it.

You look at yourself and ask yourself:
where I came from? Who am I? How am I?

You know, the place to make decisions
the place where we really are,

our authentic self, we take the ego.

And every time we take our decisions in the ego,
Begin to happen to all sorts of things

removes us from finding meaning

So ..- in life.

how do you know if you take
a decision of the higher self?

Measure everything according to how you feel.

Are you stressed? Are you anxious? Scared? Angry?

I feel good about yourself?
Do you feel that you have a purpose?

Do you feel that your life has any meaning?
When the act

the only part of you that is authentic,
Your answer is blessing.

But on the bright side of ambition?

That is, are .. I am a filmmaker and if I had ..

Ego can not serve me?
That is, if only I would let go with the flow .. no ..

I would never finish a movie!

That's the conclusion you reached
to think that through ego.

In fact, it can even make movies better
If you look at a higher level point.

Imagine yourself as being able to live and work and do everything you do
in this place .. Let's call it dharma.

What is dharma?

Dharma is a spiritual principle involving
there is a purpose for our lives

How a rodent has a dharma,
A bird has a dharma, everything has a purpose.

And when you find yourself living in agreement with that purpose,

you have found your dharma. Dharma is something that you know ...

something that you live by.

And, rather than ..

.. constantly to use ego, will begin
I'm here to tell,

I call it a calling, a call is internal.

And you know who is your dharma?
And if you can not even find your dharma?

Yes, if I can not even have a meeting
I do not think I can find the dharma.

Well, you .. Your dharma is not something you ever find
Your Dharma is something that you are always connected, is ..

It is your divine purpose, is something that ..

-Hey! -

you line up along your whole life. Hello! -

Ego kept us away from this ..

-Sorry, you must respond.
That's what talking-

Sorry to interrupt you, how can it to me
help to find a partner?

You do not need to find a partner. If you live what they say,

you understand that everything will be perfect and that everyone will come into your life will come at the right time perfectly.

You are a divine creation of God, you are a spiritual being,
you do not need anyone else to confirm it to you.

I loved it.

True, Dr. Dyer said so!

That's the case.

You know? I do not want to believe that
not appreciate what you say, because I appreciate ..

It's not necessarily interest you
As I say,

because it is ego who tells you what to think, right?

So
you heard!

Yes, we listened! Just because I think it's good to have a plan.

Well, what's your plan?

To be a successful filmmaker, to win me a name, to make money
.. To have a good relationship.

So I speak here of prosperity, talk
about abundance, talk about happiness ..

 I have a problem with that!

I drew the abundance and
prosperity in my life forever, I think

.. Something really simple to do;
really believe that!

For you!

Well you know? Problem reporting is your ego,
Ego and .. and .. your attachments. You know?

You attach the .. how much money you earn,
you realize how well the movie ..

Everything is in the form in which ..
He told me I should go?

When you attach to things and they disappear, then ..
lose who you are.

I feel .. Pushing so much to survive.

We are not talking here of survival,
talk about a change,

a shift away from the morning of your life
they had to do everything ..

.. External reasons, and move ..
an elevated place in your life.

Why not start with this tomorrow?

How do I change?

It's a good idea. You know, they always say
those in the audience who listens to me,

If this is something new for you, about
you have not heard,

perhaps there is a change that is going to you.

That's all I missing

It can happen ..

When great thinkers speak
about union with God,

is always the issue:
it is to be in silence.

When everyone is sleeping
and no distractions,

When you feel one with the source ..
This is where you are closest to the source.

Being a single source
not only makes you feel good,

make you aware of your own divinity,

and what is able to do.

It refers to a return to the place where you came.
T.S Elliot has a famous quote:

You should not stop seeking,
and finally all our searches ..

.. You have to go back to where we started
and know the place .. for the first time

You have to stop.

Wayne! Stop there a minute.
Wait a second.

What is happening?

It's a bad angle, you must descend a little.

How long?

Five minutes.

Wayne, take your five minutes.
Wait there until the rearrange.

Sure, no problem.

You want some water, Dr. Dyer?

No Thanks! We have an ocean here!

Hey, you called the office of Alex Chase, of the ACM.
Please leave a message for Alex after the tone. Thank you.

Alex, David is. Call me when you hear the message,
are .. I am a little worried.

I think something would have to hear before.
What they said exactly?

You know what? And .. and .. why we had no meeting yet?

-See the difference? --Yes-

Call me, I would be grateful.

Interviews by Wayne Dyer, the second day.

Go!

Ok, we start with the transition
from ambition to meaning.

Wonderful, is a good idea. I could give you
an example from my life

that might help.
When I started writing,

I was blessed, is considered successful in quotation marks.

My motivation, very often was ..
How much money will I do with this book?

How to show the next contract? A, ..
How many weeks to appear in the list of best-sellers
of The New York Times?

What took place?
Ä, AA .. will appear on The Tonight Show?

Will appear at the Donahue show?

Wait, are confused.

Yes?

Yes, if successful,
Who cares what motivate you?

Well, I think you start to change the definition

about what constitutes success.

That is, success can be identified
those terms and there are also other forms of the watch.

-There are people who listen to you, that is,
where would you be if not .. you had started? -

Ie, who were then, right?

Sorry for interrupting, but .. change
one question and answer format?

Only I was just curious. Sorry.

No, it's all right. It is a very normal question.
It is a very common concern that the world has.

For me, talking about my writing, David
and yes, it was really successful

but .. was a part of me, me, who said ..
that there is something more for me.

He writes books about psychology.
Your erroneous zones, how to overcome your own limits,
The sky is the limit ..

All went well. All were best-sellers.

But inside me changed me.
It was a call to something else,

and I could see changes can be done in my life.
And the change was ..

was more towards spirituality.
It was more towards a more elevated consciousness.

I started to become .. excited and .. passionate
I read in the Krishnamurti or Muktananda.

I remember I went to my agent and I said:

I want to write a book about how to
interpret these great spiritual ideas

And I said no no no no no,
Her to write a book about sex!

He said that .. it will sell, it's like ..
Dr. Ruth already has one ..

but you are much better than Dr. Ruth!
You know .. and then still continue and I said:

And then a second book for you.
We will do a deal for a set of two books

And you write about how to make money, you know?

Wayne Dyer's vision on how to make money!

And I said Artie, that's it. I said
I can not do it, you need to write about ..

But he said: No, no one will buy it!
That's it. These are stories ..

away from us, new-age nonsense. You do not want

And I said: But you have to write it!
That's what I live,

That's what I feel is so intense ..
I remember I sent my proposal and said:

Very well, I will send my not paid
advances seriously because she did not believe.

But I still continued. I was kind of feeling
I had strong internal something more to give.

I had something I had to do that was
beyond to let me go with the flow,

to do only what we already learned to do.

I remember when I made changes
Although I was a little afraid, I remember that I was ..

perhaps more freely than ever had been in my life.
I was not motivated by .. If people will buy it,

How much money will I do if I want
put in the list of best-sellers.

Those have become types of external factors
Becoming things that I watched it on me

I rather than on them.
Actually, David, what you trying to say is that

reach a point in your life
where you begin to be guided by something that is bigger than you.

Just line up with the thing you're here
and stay in harmony with Spirit

God, the source, stand there!

And while you stay there one-way stage of your life
will take over the bar.

And once you get to the afternoon of your life
is impossible to go back.

-Wait, wait .. Months? You can not continue to tell me that
will be months!
If passed as you had told me it five months ago.

-We pause for a second-

-No! We do not!
Do not tell me that! What do you mean?

I replace?
I do not know what to say?

The film that meant everything to me!
That .. I ..

I gave them this movie! It's my movie!
The film that meant everything to me!

Damn!

Ok, that would be a good time for a break.

Do you think is better? Or ..?

I think it will be better, to call food.

Eat something and then ..

Lunch break lasts an hour and a half. Those who will not
must remain to eat nearby.

Hey, you might like a little golf?

Oh, sure!

Ok, you make a reservation.

Thank you.

You know how this one would last meeting after lunch?

I do not know. I think that keeps some
the most important topics for the final.

What?

A million things are a San Francisco project.
Contractor has provided less than worth now .. budget is insufficient

-Oh, you know what? Listen, you put me in touch with
Still later, while playing golf

Do not go back?

Yes, I'm back .. a try. Just ..
I have much work to do.

See you later.

Ok.

It's a good book?

It's not bad. I am a lecturer as slowly
but have patience with me.

You said you worked for my husband?

A long time ago. I do not think that remembers me.

Oh, I think I remember.

Wow .. We were fired on several at a time, because ..

you know, need to reduce staff.

I'm sorry for that.

Hey, it's ok. With true. It is one of
the best things that happened to me.

I need to try different things,
to follow other paths.

Like your music!

Like my music, yes.

Well, it seems that your story has a happy ending.

Not yet, I hope!

Not

Do not rush me now!

No, not what I meant,
but as you seem happy.

Well .. Come on, you know what? You and Chad should come
to this party tonight at singing.

Oh .. Thanks, anyway.

Come on! It should be a celebration
continues to love. Not so named it?

Yes, I think so.

Then you should be and will there
to help us celebrate.

Oh, I can not slip at a party.

I just asked.

You can not invite us!

Too late! Already .. has happened.

Ee .. not. Thank you, anyway.

See you around here.

Ok.

To wear something comfortable!

Denise! Denise!

Hey, slow down! Stop it!

Oh, good!

Why did not you stop?

I have not seen.

Where are you going?

I went to town.
I thought you were in meetings all day.

I was .. but .. I was bored.

Well, if Hugh Johnson can do it, you can too.

Are not made for non-profit stuff.

Oh, Chad, just to pretend.

No, come with you.

What?

I said they come to you in the city.

Dear .. I love you
but I like to go shopping with you.

I need some time with me.

I thought it was time to spend together. Right?
Look, Denise, no joke,

not yet support a meeting. Go with you!

How do

Hey! Kids! Stop!

Take it from here or you will remain without water guns.

Oh, you have watered everywhere!

Oh, no big deal. It's just water! The water is soft.
Do not worry, it's great.

I'm so sorry!

Do not you seem! I have eight children, have grandchildren,
these things happen, it's chaos at times.
It's fun!

Thank you. That makes me feel a little better.

I always saw it as an opportunity to practice ..
what I call non-interference.

Oh, I wish I could do that.

Well, you can! Sure you can!

Really?
That is, are their mother, not a kind of irresponsibility?

Do not see it all as an irresponsibility.
I think that being parents is .. do your children
to be prop up in you.

It's just to make unnecessary dependence.
They have a compass. Let them follow their own compass!

Hmm .. and what would I do with myself if I interfere?

I do not know. Have you ever thought about music, or art,
or something like that?

How did you know? ..

Know what?

Nothing.
Thank you. It was .. very very pleasant to talk to you.

And for me. God bless you!
Namaste! (Peace be with you!)

Namaste!

Well, kids. Come on! It's lunchtime!

I do not want to eat!
Me neither!

Just come to eat when you're hungry!

-.. Eleven touch-down sites and interception ..-

Tuesday. Pa.

I think I'll return that dress.

The one you just bought?

The red.

I waited 45 minutes after you
as to decide if you want to buy.

I do not think that I like.

And then you bought it?

In fact, I already believe.

You took an hour to buy a dress that was already!

Ä, stand exactly why that should not come
shopping with me.

I have an idea ..
Why do not you stop talking to each other at all?

Jesus, Chad.
Really ought to come alone.

Was troubling me a lot.

You have several things in mind!

What can you have in mind?

All right.
I did not want to tell you this until tonight, but ..

What?

This weekend is an adventure for you, right?
Since you are in leadership that meeting ..

Right.

You are about to have another adventure ..

And what does that mean?

Ahh, God, try to express this in a way familiar to you.

Yeah, well .. I did not close well.

I am pregnant.

What!
Are you kidding!?

No, no kidding.

I do not want children.

I know, I do not want. But that just happened
and I thought

Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe should experience
this thing which tells everyone that is so wonderful.

You know, maybe, maybe it's time to stop being so selfish
and begin to think of anyone but ..

I want to be selfish! I like being selfish!

I like our lives. We come and go when we want.
We are happy!

Oh .. You think we're happy, Chad?

I do not know if we are happy. I mean, Lord,
you are always at work and .. and .. we do not see us!

I'm always at work because they have
Buy your things that you, Denise!

Cars, clothes, houses, whatever you want.
But still not enough to make you happy!

Please speak slowly!

I want this baby! I think the thing can be
well we can do with our lives.

Come on! I understand what it is.

It's about the fact that you feel that you have not done anything in your life, so that you feel that you need a child to be validated.

Well, you know what? I do not!

I worked to get out of anything and I will not sacrifice
our lifestyle so that you

to treat yourself and have a different concern.

Wow!

A child is a pair of shoes, Denise.

I know it, Chad!

You're so cruel and so evil.
God, once you were funny. What happened?

You planned this, right?

It was an accident!

Sir, you have to ask you to leave ..

Please!

It can happen!

How could you do that? How could you do that?

Thank you so much!

Thank you for this tender and precious moment made that all women dream ..

Tender and precious time? Well we do not tender and precious moments.

No, we do not.

You know what we? We have a prenuptial agreement, an agreement.
You've signed, no children!

I know I changed my mind, ok?
People can change, Chad.

You know what? I changed my mind I do not!

Oh, and what to do for that?
To divorce because I am pregnant?

I could do. In fact, you certainly divorce!

Can you please shut up?

Ok, fine. I do not care. Do it!
Will be better to raise this child without you.

Good luck! You signed that contract.
I'll get more, you make sure ..

I hate you!

Mr. .. I'm fine! -

Will still be .. I'm fine! -

Sir, you'll have to ask you to leave.

Oh, go.

Do not worry about payment.

I will surely pay the lunch.

Please, do not need.

Oh, she has my wallet!

Hey!
You took the wallet, manic!

Have you left the room, you idiot!

Call my lawyer call him right now!

Oh, how to do this without your precious phone?

Hey, come back!
Go back!

Say something ..

Sample, the sample .. 1, 2, 3, I hear?

All right.

It's better than to sit in the cold, is not it?

That's

Hey, want to keep the same size frame, right?

Yes, sure.

Very well. We are ready!

Ok, go ..

Wayne, you could just ..
to move your chair a little ..?

Sure. How is it?

Ok, perfect. Perfect, brilliant.

Ok, so that .. are you?

We are well.

In regulãDavid

Film ...

David?

David, let's start from where
Wayne talked about change!?

I could only Contiu there ..

For me it's good.

Ok, this .. change, this movement from
ambition to meaning,

from morning to afternoon of your life
generally preceded by

what is called a time quantum.

May sound strange for you to use a term like this,
but in reality time quantum refers to ..

featured as when you ..
what Maslow called a peak experience.

The first of these qualities .. are four in total,
The first is that .. is very intense.

The second quality, a characteristic of this
quantum moments, is that it is a surprise.

The third characteristic of these moments of quantum
is that they are favorable, always give a good feeling.

The fourth and last quality is that endure.
That wants to say that there is

something that simply comes and go and is outside you.
Stay with you forever.

For example, I recently stopped drinking, 21 years ago.

Nor could I imagine that I could let myself
because he always drank two or three beers a day

along the 10, 15 or 20 years before.
I could not even remember a day not to drink.

And I knew I had to make that change, and ..
was 4:05 am in the morning, I remember when ticking clock.

I woke up and was like ..

was like a breeze in the room,
something that never experienced before.

Aroma of roses that was 21 years ago
and I can tell you that hanging from the closet

of the tab that was there on a mirror
I had a little cartoon, I can see

thing as if
as if it happened this morning.

The intensity of this experience is something I could never forget.

I remember how surprised I was
what happens then.

It was almost like .. kind of force
took control and I was simply amazed by this.

So if you are lucky that you are reachable happen?

No, David, has nothing to do with luck. It's like ..
when the time is right, you're in a different state,

in a different place in your life, what
you should happen, will happen for you.

Points down in your own life, these moments
when you think nothing can go wrong ..

Often the things we need to
to propel us to a higher place.

Let me give you an example.

Night before this moment and I just described ..
I took all the family, five children and my wife,

and I went together to a restaurant.

And as I always do every time you go to a restaurant
not only ordering a beer, but two, and that was ..

if the wait staff will not be there when I ordered
the second beer, you can still have it.

And the waiter said: Oh, excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry but .. I can not serve alcohol

And I said why?

And he said: Well, last night one of the waiters
served on someone who was a minor and we have suspended the authorization

I said: Let us get out of here!

And I got up on each child,
I went to Massini, I put belts and so on ..

My wife, God knows how many have to do
and it was so difficult for her to leave the house ..

But nothing seemed to matter to me in that moment,
because I wanted to have my beer,

and I think more important than all others,
and went and we went to another restaurant.

And I remember thinking that night,
When preparing for bed, but ..

how ashamed I was. My wife tried to talk
least to me about this, but .. I did not want to hear anything ..
I was right!

And that's what makes your ego always
makes you you're right.

And that night ..
that experience I had at 4:05 am the following day

made me not only to give up alcohol, probably saved my life.

He transformed lives in so many different ways, and ..
everything has happened because .. I was open to it.

Do not believe it!

Sounds as if you sit and you wait for
a kind of revelation to come to you.

Hmm ..

It is not waiting,
You know, the Tao, one of the biggest lessons we learned is

that teaches us how to be gentle,
how to be flexible,

how to not always hold control.
One of the great teachings of the Tao says:

Let life you lived!

But you did not do anything!

That's the key. Ä, sit is where you want to go
they simply give permission.

The recovery movement is told:
leaving to come out (giving up) let you enter God

To allow this source, which always runs
by all and each of us

to do and to perform magic.

And this magic will always work to our benefit most,
only if we surrender in front of her.

If only you could
to stop to interfere with your life,

and just to stop for everything to be done.
If you get in this place, nothing will remain undone.

Everything you need will be there for you.

It is mysterious to most of us, because ..
believe that we who must do everything.

Is not it interesting?

That you had everything you needed was your first nine months
Why not stay this true for the next 90 years?

For that interfere

When I was 19 I was in the U.S. Navy,
I was a soldier.

And I was given the mission to climb
the carrier, the USS Ranger.

And .. was located in Yokuska, Japan.

So I've embarked on a refrigerated ship, USS Vega
in Alameda, California.

And even when I was about to climb the ship on
a voyage of 29 days that would cross the Pacific Ocean,

My uncle Bill, Bill Volig, who was a school teacher
in Hayworth, California, gave me a hand copy of a book.

The book was a collection of short stories
by Leo Tolstoy.

He wrote novels and short stories not only great, but
and valuable spiritual literature as well.

Was considered to be the soul of Russia.

And the first nuvelaã of this collection was called:
Death of Ivan Ilyich.

Ivan Ilyich was a judge who lived in Moscow.

One of the most important shaping of this story
is his relationship with his wife.

Which, in fact, a hatred for that ..
He despised work. And it felt like she was pressured

and pushed him to do so,
because it was a prestigious job.

And it was full of rage and anger for internal herself.
Title story already expose to come:

Death of Ivan Illich .. know that he will die.

All right. Ivan Illich was lying on his deathbed,
and his wife were holding his hand. This woman, in fact,

a despised life.
And looks directly into his eyes and his last words are:

And if all my life
 was a mistake?

And died.

I was very shaken, I moved a lot,
and I took a NotePad,

and I wrote myself a note. And I said:
Dear Wayne

not die ..

with your music still in you!

And I lived it in my life.

When you die, you return to that source,
and to be in that place of love.

But Tao says you should not die to get there.
You can die for ego

and live in perfect love that space while you're here.

This intense, surprising, favorable,
eternal .. features that define

time quantum, which leads to change
is really an indicator that go back to the Source

that start living the Tao,
reconnect with the intention that field.

In Greek, the word enthusiasm is divided into entheos IASB,
which means: God within.

When you feel passion for something you have inside your enthusiasm,
that God is really speaking to you

and telling you: you can not get at the end of your life
being able to say what Ivan Illich said ..

(And if my life was a mistake?)
I can not think of a greater tragedy than that.

Hey, Mom!

What? What?

Earth to Mom, where did you go?

Sorry, but it
so beautiful!

I imagined how I paint these trees.

You can not paint the trees!

I know honey,
it's like making a painting.

You know, like when you do a drawing at school?

Mother, you are not a painter.
I did not paint something never seen.

Well .. next to the stone out there. Let's go!

Hey!

You have some money?

God bless you!

What?

I said God bless you!

Why say that? I have not even given any money.

Have you any money?

Not right now.

But you? I need to call a taxi.

Yes. Here we.
That should help you.

Thank you.

Not happen to have any cell on there, right?

I do not need.

Make money with this?

Make good money!

Where do you live?

There.

There.

But my favorite place there.
Under that tree, it's my favorite.

I know that tree,
we are friends.

That's good right?

You know what to do?
Take a few bottles of-this,

and you can make some money.
There is a device,

baby bottles inside and
make some money.

Thank you!

Maybe I can gather for a cell phone.

Hey!

You have some money?

Yes, I have.
We have six pence.

God bless you!

Synchronicities
It's a collaboration with destiny

it becomes the norm
and the ego is no longer the driving force in your life.

You start to recognize that there is intelligence
strong organization that is in all things.

And working with you and for you.
Almost as if you do those things to happen

only being connected with your Source.

Destiny, which seemed something imposed on you
of something outside your

no longer relevant driving force in your life.

You are connected to Source. And it's like this
divine intelligence and organizing, God, Tao,

how you want to call it as you would say:
Music you can not you come here and I will be there

to help to overcome any conflict or obstacle that appears.

But there is a conflict as a source for your support.

Yes, good.
Could you send me a cab, please, at Monterey Motors?

Yes.
Thank you, thank you very much. Goodbye.

I keep thinking about what you said about
destiny that we required.

Well, you know? I think all and
Each of us has inside knowledge,

so they say that when you trust in yourself,
just trust in the intelligence that created you.

It's there to tell us who we are and who we are meant.

I know, but it's like ..

-Hey! -

Want to drink?

No, I'm fine.
Dr. Dyer, I can ask a question?

Sure!

Men and women are different? When it comes to
this change is different?

It is very different indeed. There are some recent studies
I just published about it.

I would like to share with you, if you will.

That would be great.

Okay, great!

Well, go too.

Ok, I'll be after you.

So that .. This study was done incredible
I have right here. It's called:

Moments that you turn upside down values.
And has four components:

Men and women before and after.

Now, before a time quantum
they were asked to list

most important priorities in their lives,
the most important up to the least important.

Now, for men, the first and most important value
they had learned was being,

accumulation of money.
It's not a huge surprise,

because we are taught, as men, they grow,
that your job is your family argue that we must stand out.

The second most important value for all these men was
a sense of adventure.

To come out .. and want to conquer the world

Yes, to be slick-

Yes, sure. To be

Being a macho man.

The third was what you do.
You know, that men are raised to think that you

What you realize what you are doing, what you are able to create.

The fourth is the idea of ??pleasure.
You know, to go out with friends, to have as many meetings,

how to have some more fun.

The fifth one is to be respected.
And we all know, as men, what this means, right?

"Do not treat me with respect, man .."

And out in the world, you're an adult or you're a kid,
and if you are not respected .. of party strife.

Here are the most important priorities in our lives.
You can make money, have a sense of adventure,

to accomplish things, to feel pleasure,
to be respected, this is actually the morning of our lives.

That sounds like my list.

What you talking about? When was the last time you had fun?

Oh .. not listened to it, I know how to have fun.

Excuse me, I try to listen to Wayne.
Continue!

Thanks, I appreciate it.

Very good, now the second part of the study,
which is the stage after.

A quantum change occurred.
Are the same questions, only many years later,

and followed them throughout life.
And number one is spiritual value.

Spirituality, the number one changed
from making money to spirituality, not even

Lisa was not before, not even you can not find it,
I list here the top 15 of and does not even appear.

The second is personal peace.
Less anxiety, less stress, if you want.

The third is the family. Now, the family was on
other list, but was much lower before.

Now, what happens after one of these moments,
You start to look around and say:

Why is it important for me in my life?

And then the next is the will of God,
this is the one that says: I felt purpose.

And then honesty is the fifth quality.
Not just because he honestly does not steal, but ..

how honest are, as a man, you know?
With my feelings with ..

-Inside-

Yes, exactly!
Those were the main qualities of men.

So we have a before and after,
You can see the significant change took place,

What change has occurred.

Good evening all!

Hello!

Thank you. We are very happy to be here tonight,
Steve and Lisa are some dear old friends of mine.

So when I asked about the possibility that
Our wedding band to play their

I felt that I had no option other than to say ..

Are you sure?

You are convinced that this is what you want to divert the
your friends and family in celebration of your wedding day?

And Steve and Lisa assured me that
This was exactly what he wanted to depart on

friends and family in celebration of their wedding day.
So that .. here we are.

-You need a boss that loves you-

A boss who to hug-

A boss who to dress up and to take care of yourself-

A boss to own control-

You need a man with all the answers-

A boss to make the show

A boss to pay the all-

-Never say I do not know-

Ok ..
-I know that is to ask!

I can already tell you. -Yes-.

How it works with women?

For women it is even more surprising.
Before one of these moments of quantum

value is the number one family.
And it is not surprising that women

are, somehow, raised in our society, our culture,
to be a good mother to be a good daughter

take care of your family, your children and so on.

The second, which might surprise you, was a feeling ..
independence, to feel like ..

I would like to feel independent

Women are paradoxical.

Yes, binds.

The third was his career.
Very often, women are not even felt

that had the right to try to have a career,
because they were obliged to take care of their family,

And it's not that minimize this, but what
what we say here is just something more.

The fourth quality for women was
employment (the template).

Need to be like others and so on.

Yes, and then, finally, to be attractive. And this has become ..
not only good to look good, but:

all my values ??depend on the look
Where is that?

You know what? This is so scary when you analyze it,
because of where we learn that women should

to thank the other all the time?

Well, go to a newsstand.
All you see are magazines with pictures of

Here the size of both girls, and ..
implants, more emphasis on makeup

of brands to be,
appropriate bags to wear, and so

So that became this top quality, or
characteristics, or values, for women,

before one of these changes.

I hope that after the list is better.

Values ??were changed completely.

Number one value for women after
Why had this experience, says right here, is:

My own personal development.

Now remember that before he was to take care of all
others to do the right thing,

to fit, and now suddenly is
As I develop as human beings?

What I feel about myself?

The second is a feeling of self-esteem.
Worth something? How I feel about myself?

I am a human being valuable?

The third is spirituality.
My sense of my connection with something bigger and more awesome than me.

And then, happiness.
Again, this was not on the list,

was near the end of the first list.

How often were raised to believe women
that their happiness is important?

that do the right thing to do,
instead .. feel:

I have the right to be happy!

And then a very interesting, called forgiveness.
That became very important in their lives.

Forgiveness ..

That's good! Because then I can forgive all those who
you were given wrong information about what

supposed to do.

Yes, it is a great deal of resentment, which starts to
II comprises people

is ..

e..

is something that many people simply live.

Oh, Joe! is great-

You're the best, thanks!

Yes, that's better, that's what you should do-

Thank you very much.

Good night, kids.
You had a busy day.

Can you bring a glass of water?

Sure!

Jason, what is this?

Hmm?

Paper and pencils were here before this.

I do not know. I have no idea.

Jason?

Hmm?

I think I'll take a shower.

Ok.

Want to hear something?

Perhaps the only miracle that happened in my life.

A miracle?

Yes, it was a real miracle for me.

It was a healing that took place
you still can not explain.

So that .. was in 2000 and went to
a group of 25 people in a spiritual circuit

Assisi. I made several visits there.
In fact, I wrote an entire book,

There is a spiritual solution called for each problem,
based on the prayer of St. Francis.

And I lectured a few hours on it
and visited all the places where St. Francis

lived and made many of his miracles.

The next day we had to do a trip
in a place called San Damiano,

where Saint Clara, which was the first woman to become
member of the Franciscan order, lived.

And on the third floor was the bedroom, just as
was in the thirteenth century.

He was a young man on that trip, was 21 years
his name was John and he was from Pennsylvania.

Suffered from a terrible paralysis
and had two very heavy brackets for each leg.

I was going to climb on the third floor and spiral staircase was
to reach the third level,

St. Clara's bedroom where he was.
John, to be able to climb stairs,

had to move his foot to the outside so
you can imagine, and then make up

and brought it down and then make up the next level
and lifted his other leg, his limbs were rigid because.

But when I started to get into the tight a..
ladder could not

His legs could not climb, he could only raise them both,
so that he could not climb and you can imagine could not descend,

was impossible for him to descend.
So it was stuck there.

I was in front of
and I stopped and said to me:

Wayne, I have problems. I can not climb any ladder
because they can not lift my leg. I did not place.

And I can not get off. What do we do?

And it was a whole row of people behind, waiting to climb
On this scale very narrow, you can imagine?

-Elders not whisper-

I hear that old-for-

-We just talk more hard-

, Year after year-

-Stop looking at me amused-

-Come here-

-And I will whisper-

You have some wonderful cheek-

Want to dance? -Oh no! -.

Oh, yes!

-Will grow more and more an old-
Honey, come on! Do not be shy!

Old-backs become stiff-

-All the legs are wider and longer-

Dreamers dream-all-

-Are carried away by you-

Denise?

Denise?

So I told him that without even thinking about:

John, what I do is just
to catch up over my back and put your arms

around my neck, and .. just bend
and I will go up on the stairs.

Now, what I said is not that before you go
in this journey, I seriously hurt

right knee to a point where
I was examined by several orthopedists,

and I was told that soon will come a time when
I had to replace the knee, because it is rubbing bone on bone.

So, while up behind me, talking about
about 110 pounds, he came ..

I got about three steps and I realized that my knee
ago to give and would fall.

And I had a glimpse of what the newspaper, news of Assisi
will report the next morning:

Spiritual director falls on stairs.
40 people dead.

So while my knee began to give way,
At that time, I had a vision of St. Francis.

I had a vision of how it looks.
And no word said, was very very quickly.

He was just so, with his hands,
In other words, get up!

And suddenly I felt the fragrance of roses that was in the air,
same flavor that ..

Remember that story I said it? -The quantum of time! -

The quantum of time, when I went ..
through something similar. And

I got up and started to climb stairs with him
and my knee suddenly recovered,

was good.

Not only recovered, but suddenly I had something like ..
a burst of energy, as we never had before

and started to go faster, with him in the back.
Then I started to run. And I ran the whole scale.

My wife and I expect the above said
What happened was you? What are you doing? Everyone pulls

breath, and you ..
And I said:

I just experienced a miracle. I do not know what happened

And I realized that my knee hurt me not at all
and not limp and not feel any pain.

By the way, I never do any surgery on this knee.
It was .. healing was held at that time.

Hey!
Living in bed?

Yes, come in a minute.

What did you do?

Nothing.

I thought he was going to make your shower.

I did.

And your clothes?

Aaa .. I wanted to do, but then .. I took nothing.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Are you okay?

What do you mean?

Well, you seemed a little stranger today
just wondering if something was wrong.

No, I'm fine. Do not worry!

I am a little worried.

No!

Can I look?

Jason, no!

Come on, I just have a look ..

-Jason .. not! -

I love what you do, I just want to watch ..

Can you please leave?

Come on, I just want to ..

Just get out!

Please?

No!
You know?

However not too good
Do not trouble

Later I began to vorbec about this miracle, but
what I did was

when people asked me why do you think happened to you?

Always say, well
why not? Ie they are ..

Wayne Dyer, in the end!

And I wrote a whole book about it and e..

And I deserved a miracle -

Yes! It was like .. I thought that was really
special kind of thing came to me.

This was, you know, when you let your ego get involved.
And what happened then is that I ..

I completely forgot my ego.

It was not because they are so high and spiritual, or that are so special, I instant reaction to what John needed

was just out to meet them .. and then the miracle happened.
In a moment, without thinking, I went to meet a

signs, if necessary, and .. I forgot myself,
and was almost as if .. door was opened,

Masters found me and told me: Here it is!
The best way to open those doors is

you forget yourself and go out to meet and serve.
Always serve it.

You know, one of the mistakes that so many people make is that I say:
Well, I'll draw what I want in my life

And one of the things that deeply believe in is that
not attract what you want,

attract what you are.

WHAT YOU

Hey, hey!

Denise!

Denise, come here!

Sorry! I'm sorry! -No! -

I'm so sorry! Should not have to ..

Hey, hey!

Look at me!

Look at me!

It's all right.

No, not good.
It is not good!

Everything will be fine.

No, I did this

Everything will be fine. No, you did nothing.

I felt I really ..

I did that.
I made it more like you.

Listen to me .. I'm sorry!

I love you.

I love you so much!

You'll be fine.

Do not stop! It was great!

Thank you.

What keeps you awake so late?
Or would have had to say so earlier?

I could not sleep.

Problems with the filming?

No, that's good.
The film is easy.

My business is one that can not handle.

Hey, have you heard of chopsticks?

The past.

It reminds me of when I was a kid.

When I was idealistic when I thought I'll make a name.

Oh, hey, do not say that!

You have a name.

Yes, but something like Hanson, Scorsese or Tarantino

Hang in there, anything can happen ..

Why be so hard?
Today we have the funds to make my movie

and tomorrow ..
I can not get the money to do without a name ..

.. And I do not get a name out of money.
And then I simply take the project.

Not even belong to me.
I am thinking seriously ..

job change.

Ä, be it a good sign.

What?

Give up.

That's good.

How do you know?

You can not push things.

Well ..
The magic thing again

What magic thing?

I do not know why I say this ..
seviciu man .. or what have you sheep ..

They do many things here.
Believe me!

You play the piano very well, though.
You should think to do this as a job.

Well .. for a while I thought that I will.

And? What happened?

I started singing when I was very young.
I was a talent.

And then I grew and I became more aware
the people watching me sing.

And then ..

I started playing more for themselves
than for me.

And then I became very scared
because I would be disappointed.

And so I did.

What did you do?

I have disappointed everyone.

I was very smart, I went to a concert ..
and I played a few ..

intentionally wrong notes ..
As evidence

to see if I would just love
and

in fact they did not.

It's been a long time and then up again to reach the piano.

It's just .. crazy,
when I think how much I like to sing.

Yes, I just thought about it.

Ä, is sitting here for years
but I grabbed him

I have not even noticed.

You pianist? I do not understand.

Do not you understand?

How could you ignore what was right in front of you?

For that you get with other things.
You should understand that.

What?

Wait. Keep your idea.
Hear that?

I can not hear anything ..

Listen

Listen

This is beautiful. I love it.

That I liked.

Improvise?

Yes well, no ..
In a way ..

In a way, yes, but generally do not ..

What?

It's just something you can do.

That is to write?

No! I can not ..

Then pretend well.

I just .. I listen.

Are you listening?

I listen to ..
And then just sing what I hear.

I do not invent at all.
It invents single

Only?

Exactly.
I just sing.

Sometimes all you need to do ..
is to show and be careful ..

and music is.
Your music is.

Whatever you're looking for in your life
is there for you.

He will make an appearance where and when needed.
It is always in your mind.

Whatever you need to complete this project,
or whatever you need to create,

everything is there.
Can you prepare and then to stop.

It is a basic trust that everything
will happen perfectly.

Lean forward, then towards the bottom of the column-

Bend knees, place hands on floor,
move your hips up and down,

Left, Right, Left, Right ..

-You know what? -
I can not shoot here.

No?

No, it's too much reflex.

Well, we really need something for the second.
We have nothing.

Let not
No director! I do not know what does David!

Why not here, anyway?

Probably sleeping a hangover be.

Well, you must go, I can not shoot from here, out.

Oh, well. Brilliant. Enter and filming.

Not living with me

I? Do not go.
Must be 200 degrees there!

Ok.

But you?

The wind is like it here ..

You should receive a bonus for that.

You are my hero!

You are nasal.

Hey, good morning!

Good .. morning?

I woke up early. We search for locations.

What?

We found the greatest place
overlooking the ocean.

Why? For that?

Yes, yes, that!

Seriously?

It's a bit far.

This is good
You'll benefit from your creativity ..

You seem inspired, David!

I'm inspired!
Make music, do you have ..

What are you talking about?

What is Rob there one?

That's a little crazy torture with hot yoga.

Yes ..

I can not leave him there alone.
Cover me, I'll go.

You'll get?

Come in, I can not believe it!

We live in a world where all things are possible.
There are no accidents.

It is this divine intelligence, organizing
supporting it.

I think we should get to
Stop focusing only on you.

And about the things you really want for you ..
to begin to say:

as I might want more for others,
than they want for me?

And this is the work of God.

One of the things that happen when you
remove the ego is that you change the

to feel that everything you ought to feel the humble.
Do you realize that you ought not nothing,

only ego that thinks.

So the fundamental truth is
you have to be that what you created.

If you created divinity, must be divine.
If you raise your hands and say:

These are God's hands ..
So what does God's hands?

God only gives, that is what God knows to do.

Good!

How are you this morning?

Better than yesterday.

This is a good shape to be!

Not better than anyone else, only
better than you were.

Hey ..
I was wondering ..

Is there a place here where I could buy some flowers?
I would like to take some of my wife.

Can I let you get some of this, if you want.

Seriously?

Yes.
That is, not luxury flowers, such as

those that take the flower, wild roses are just ..
more rustic.

I think my wife would be able to even likes it.

Hey, wait, let me help you!
Cut .. just cut the leaves that ..

leaves over there ..
and tries to do a little oblique.

That's it!
Welcome!

You know that I never done this?

Do not get too good at gardening?

No, usually they pay others to
take care of my garden.

People who know what they do, like you.

Yes, well, I like a lot to do this.

I never saw the value of flowers, I suppose.

I've never sent flowers to your wife?

No.

Oh, that sounds bad.

Well, today is a new day.

Yes it is!

You know, there are over 200 species of roses.

And there is a database of roses
which has over 6,000 variations of roses.

It seems almost excessive.
You!

Thank you very much. I can give you a tip?

No, no, thank you.

Are you sure?

It's okay.

I will certainly tell the owner of this
place that has good staff.

You just did.

You?
Are you the owner?

Well .. Yes, they are.

I apologize, I
I thought you were .. just a gardener.

This is an easy mistake to make.

So the wet flowers? ..

Well

Plants need to be watered.

Yes, they need.

Thank you once again.

Can I ask you something?

Yes, sure.

I'm here for a meeting of a committee.

Yes, the Promise House, right?

Yes, we need to give it executive director,
but do not know the camera stands.

Oh, I can find.

Well, actually
Could you give it to him for me?

Yes, sure, it's important?

There are only
Only some papers.

Ok, fine.

And if you could give him this afternoon,
After I have left.

Yes, I could do that.

I am grateful.

So that you change your thoughts to:
What will I get? to:

What can I offer? How can I help?

If your attention is outside you and
in connection with giving, the universe will respond

giving you and you back.

The universe will say, what can I help you?
But you must be as a servant,

then when the transition is complete.
When you move there, which is without ego.

Hey, good!

Good!

I missed you yesterday. We had a great game.

Yes, I was stuck in the city.

Yes, I understand. The problems arise.

Yeah, that's

A, as the meeting went?

Nothing has changed. Still need money.
Once they have money, we'll see who

will get the contract.
See you in town.

Well, see you.

Not so fast!
Do not ring, do not want to destroy the flowers!

That's very good.
Oh, you say, do not want to know how the flowers have cost this.

You know, are the same flowers that the mayor uses.
Oh, be careful, please!

Thank you!

How about if the name Rose will be a girl?

As we move to phase in the meaning of our lives,
is not as if we have not be ambitious,

difference is that the way of ambition.
You are ambitious in relation to other things.

So now your ambition is transformed in order.
And you must learn to become observer

and give a step back.
Start living moment

trusting in where you will take your source.
Results begin to detach.

And this separation allows you to not fight always
and only allows things to come to you.

You are not the person who makes things happen,
allow them to appear.

The fight is gone.

And I asked again and again:
there is any purpose for ego?

And my reaction to this is simply not worth guarding him.
Ego is the false self.

And when you defend,
defend an illusion.

Defend something that is not really who you are.
Your authentic self is beyond the ego.

Each of us knows that we came here
with music from singing.

Yet we tend to think that we enitãti
separate, and .. that we must qualify

and that this is the role of our lives.
And anything that's not true.

Change can take place in many ways.
It may be just a comment

may be a coincidence occurs,
a particular event that is not expected

can be anything.
But the result is always the same.

Began to realize that you are not here to
forcing life to make a fight of it always,

you are here to enjoy and to live in peace.

This is what happens when you are in the afternoon of your life.

I think of all the things you need to do
as to pack for departure.

Oh, yeah?

I'm like a list of things to do ambulance.

90% of my days I care for lives
all around and all their problems.

You are very appreciated!

That's not what I meant.
I like to take care of you and the boys really.

I love my family, but

But?

the paint
go somewhere else

I feel connected,
I feel blessed.

And you're good at it.

I miss you so much!
When I went yesterday ..

when Jack told me that I do not paint,

I realized that my own children
have no idea who I am.

They do not know what I do.

Then do it!

Seriously?

Yes, of course!

Thank you.
I want to stay here.

What?

Only for a week.
Right now, only next week.

Do you think I will leave here alone?

Jason!

Every cell of my body wants
him to stay here just a little more

I hear you, but I
I have no idea what you're saying.

I need to refocus,
I need to find my way back

solitude and I need to do that.

But .. you are the mother of two young children,
can not you part of loneliness ..

Jason! You should know that I love you!

And I love the children ..
and are still in us, but more than that.

Ok. There is only one problem.
You see, I do not know how to do what you do.

Oh, I'll handle it.
It's just for a week.

You'll survive!

And then back to normal?

I do not know what to say ..

O.. a

You're good at it ..
Oh it's not fair!

You know what you'll become good?

What?

Laundry.
I see many clothes in your future.

That's that's great!
This is great.

If you want to see doors opening into your life
Break away from what your ego says

and allows you to yourself to live in this
divine place called Spirit.

And what Lao Tzu called virtues,
said that there are four in total:

The first one is reverence before
life, which refers to respect.

The second is honesty, what really
there is nothing more than honesty.

The third is the kindness, which manifests
as goodwill in our lives.

And the fourth is to provide aid, which manifests
as serving to provide services to others.

These were the four virtues.
And Lao Tzu asks us to live according to them.

It's a great quote the poet Hafiz, he said:

even after all this time,
The sun never says to the Earth: You owe me.

Just think what it can do a love like this.
Illuminates the whole world.

-When you come back? -

-In a week ... I will return in a week-

-Pa, kids -

Oh, David!

Hey

Good! What are you doing?

So that .. You get everything you needed?

I think I got even more than that.

Seriously?

I am very inspired.
I looked at some frames

and I would like to do something with this interview,
something creative.

What?

Well .. this place!
Something is happening here,

things about which you speak,
human subjects.

I think I can do something with it.

Wait a minute. I thought you were just a technician.
That's not what you said before?

I think not.
I think I'm starting to catch.

Well, you know, David? The thing is that
we will all catch.

After all, all one to understand.

It is a replica of a great chapter of Acts,
where Jesus says:

If you want to be me, knowing that
You and I are similar, I will help.

If you want to be different from me, I expect
until you change your mind.

And you'll change your mind!

And, really, is not it?
Ultimately,

Why must we die to understand?

We must be able to understand while we're here.

It was a pleasure.

Thank you, friend.
God bless you!

Nobody needs to ask themselves:
What is my purpose?

He can always find help.
If you even for a day

to be careful to make life better
for someone else, if you can focus

to think so,
God thinks so.

There is a classical concept, but
is still relevant:

to touch someone's life is more valorors
than any amount of money.

My friend, Byron Katie says:

to believe that you need what you have
is the definition of insanity.

That you can not feel fulfilled until
not get all these things, this is an illusion.

The really, you do not need anything more.
No matter what you do, you can

to be a taxi driver, a teacher, a
factory worker, a manager.

What matters is that you focus your attention on:
How can I serve?

Think of people that go,
anyone would be in your way.

You can run a whole business like that.
Without being attached to the result, but the

attentive servers.
Your life turns living according to those virtues:

How can I serve?
How can I be helpful?

How can you give respect?

Thinking it means that
live with meaning.

Morning messages are about what you
and what you can not do.

About how society defines you.
But the afternoon, after the change, are about

connection with an energy that charges for everything,
and we're all just made.

Try to stop breathing,
stop your nails to grow

Virtue is to live everything we need to do.

The truth is that I feel that all else charges,
so it's really about his surrender.

Do you teach someone who is bigger than you, which
are connected and who has control of everything really.

There is something very deep within us,
who wants to feel fulfilled, who wants to know:

My life made a difference,

So I left this .. Instead, this planet that
I lived better than when I arrived.

That's life was deeply touched
because of my existence.

We all want that.
It is not age, or you discover about yourself.

Wherever you are and of any age,
you just thought distance

to change your life.
