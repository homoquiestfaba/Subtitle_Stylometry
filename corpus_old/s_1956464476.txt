Hm?

<i>What are you listening to?</i>

I'm not listening to anything.

<i>Nothing?</i>

Right.
These are for hearing nothing.

So, how much longer
is this gonna take, man?

Look, I thought
I was paying you to soundproof

my apartment or something.

It's a B-flat.

<i>- What is?</i>
Your heating unit.

That's a shitty radiator.

You do hear
the noise though, right?

Your problem
is your heating unit.

When paired
with the low tones produced

by your kitchen appliances,
the note emitted

from your radiator
is contributing

to your... anxiety.

<i>- Really?</i>
Mm-hm.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

<i>Hey, Peter. This is
Brian Mosden, down in Tribeca.</i>

<i>Listen..</i>

<i>You know, I was
a little skeptical at first</i>

<i>uh, but I honestly haven't

<i>Thank you for whatever you did
to my blender.</i>


<i>Hi. I got your number
from my friend Alex.</i>

<i>I'm looking to set up

<i>You're punctual.</i>

I'm actually early.

I guess you're Peter?
I am.

I'm Ellen.
Do you wanna go inside?

Actually, I would prefer
to ask you some questions

outside the apartment first
before we enter.

Oh. Okay.

<i>You wanna have a seat?</i>

Uh, it's helpful for me
if I record this

<i>if you don't mind.</i>

Sure, that's fine.

This is a lot more formal
than I expected.

I... I've found
that when clients talk

about their homes
when inside them

they, they tend to speak less
directly about the issue.

Right, it can be difficult
to talk about

a relationship problem,
in this case, your apartment

with the, the partner present.

Never thought about it that way.

So, to begin..

You describe to me your person.

My person?

<i>Yourself.</i>

Oh, like, um, say my name

introduce myself,
like that kinda thing?

As you wish.

<i>Um, well,
my name is Ellen Chasen.</i>

I am from Ohio.
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

But now I live in New York.

Perhaps, uh, you could describe
your issue to me now.

I, um, I am always tired.

Exhausted, actually.

<i>By the time I get
to the office in the morning</i>

<i>I'm tired again.</i>

And where do you work?

Um, I work at a non-profit

um, for low-income families.

It's in Midtown.

And do you walk to work?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

<i>I get to help people every day</i>

<i>so, watching them</i>

they, they get
to start their lives over

I get to see that.

<i>- It's nice.</i>
No, no.

I, I asked,
"Do you walk to work?"

Oh, uh, sorry.

Um... no.

It would be, like, 40 blocks.

(DOOR OPENS)

I'll need an extended period
of time in each room.

Specifically, kitchen,
bathroom, bedroom.

Yeah, it's no problem.
Mm-hm.

Can I get you some water
or anything?

Actually,
I need it just like this.

No additional sounds.

No additional appliances.
Oh.

No, thank you.

<i>Hillary.</i>

<i>We're right around the corner.</i>

Hi, yeah, sorry,
I... I can't talk

'cause I have, uh,
company right now.

<i>Do you have
a man over there with you?</i>

No, that's not why.

<i>Yeah. Okay, I'll see you later.</i>

Okay. Bye.

Sorry.

So, at this point, I'll need
to go into your bedroom

if that's alright
with you, Ellen. Yeah?

I typically save
this visit for last

since it is the most personal,
but hopefully, you feel

a little more comfortable
with me by now?

Of course. By all means.

Can I watch?

Mm.

Mind if I lie down?

Is that typical?

You mentioned over the phone
that you're having trouble

sleeping at night.

Is that right?
Yes.


It helps me if I recreate
your morning routine

as closely as possible.

Would you say
you're a side sleeper?

<i>- No.</i>
No.


<i>I'll have to review
my materials to be certain</i>

but I think your problem
is in the kitchen.

Do you eat bagels every morning?

Uh... uh, no.

S... sometimes,
but usually toast.

Mm-hm.
With some fruit.

Okay. I think you need
a new toaster.

That should do it.

<i>I noticed your toaster
produces an E-flat.</i>

And your refrigerator
hums at a clear G.

Now, the foundation note

is a subtle but convincing C

throughout the entire apartment.

Here.

(MOUTH ORGAN MUSIC)

You hear that? Hm?

That mechanical sound?

Or, uh, perhaps
it's... it's wind patterns

on the East Side.

It's remarkably consistent.

Well... anyway

a new toaster should
solve your problems.

You really think
it's that simple?

Technically, your refrigerator
is a perfect fifth.

And the minor third created
by your toaster

combined with the tonic
from your neighborhood

and, uh, you've got
a depression.

So, I'll have a new model
sent over. Soon.

But we should talk
in the next few days.

Yes, of course.

Alright.

<i>Hm.</i>

Maybe I should just
move to Brooklyn.

<i>- Wanna swap apartments?</i>
Don't yell.

Cleo's still napping.
<i>- Sorry.</i>

I know, it's nice, it's great.

But sometimes it's a little
weird living there.

Apartment's a little big.

And I still get Patrick's mail.

<i>I hate that.</i>

Anyway, it's cheap.
So, why should I leave?

Right.

Here's to rent-stabilized

Shit!
Oh, here, let me get you a...

No, it's okay.
Let me get you a...

I'll... I'll... I'll grab
a towel.

There's some towels
on the counter there.

Okay.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Why is everything unplugged?

<i>- Oh.
Yeah.</i>

<i>- That's Landon's latest phobia.
Phobia?</i>

<i>He's afraid the apartment
will catch fire</i>

when we're not at home.

Or when we're asleep.

Or when we're eating dinner.

Or when we're having sex.
Okay.

It's not a phobia,
it's a safeguard.

So, you just leave it
all unplugged?

<i>Spontaneous electrical fires</i>

are way more common
than you think, okay?

Especially in cities.

<i>I read about them all the time.</i>

It's his OCD.

So, where are you
reading about this?

<i>The internet.</i>

So, how'd it go
with that house tuner

we set you up with anyway?

And Landon loves that guy.
I love that guy.

Yeah, it was, um,
it was a little weird.

Weird how?
Why? Is he a creep?

No, no, no, no.
Not creepy at all. At all.

Although, he did lay on my bed.

That sounds creepy.
But not in a creepy way.

Not.. He's not a creep.

He was actually very polite,
and very professional.

He told me that, um,
I need to get a new toaster.

What?
Why is that so funny?

Maybe that... maybe that's
helpful.

It sounds ridiculous,
but he was talking to me about

the tonic of my neighborhood

and how my refrigerator
is contributing

to this oppressive chord.

Yeah.
<i>- What?</i>

Yeah, that's his thing. Right?

Here, look. This is
from "Talk Of The Town."

"According to Peter Lucian,
the silence is full of sound

"as his practice offers
solutions

"for depression,
anxiety, fatigue

<i>"all of which are triggered
by the sonic details</i>

"of our homes, he explains.

"After an impromptu tour
of the converted.

Cold War-era fallout shelter
he calls home.."

This guy's so fucking cool.

"Lucian points out
the meticulous labels

<i>"attached to each appliance</i>

<i>bearing notes
and musical chords."</i>

Weird, but kind of sexy.

Is he single?
Are you serious?

Only you would find that sexy,
by the way.

So, what do you think?
You gonna give it a whirl?

I'm fine. Really.

I mean, I think all this therapy
is just too much.

It's not for me.
<i>- Really?</i>

I just need to find a
way to get some rest.

When Landon was training
for his marathon last fall

he found a great acupuncture
place in Greenpoint.

That was for my IT band.

Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

So, maybe it's worth taking
a look at.

<i>But that's..
Those are different things.</i>

Yeah, but acupuncture.

Uh, go on. Robert is waiting

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

<i>My data is supported. Maybe
they just can't comprehend it.</i>

It's all good feedback, Peter.

I encourage my students
to ask tough questions

in the critique sessions.

<i>I think they're maybe caught up
a little bit in your..</i>

In your lack of formalities.

But I'm close, though.

And you understand
the significance.

Listen, I've read it.

Don't rush yourself.
This work takes time. Years.

Well, it's been years.

This is a universal law
that I've discovered

and the scientific community
needs to know about it.

You know, there's a trap
in science

that I talk
to my students about.

One always sees exactly
what one's looking for

not because it's there

but because one desperately
wants to believe

that it's there.

Are you saying my research
is faulty?

No!

I'm just cautioning you not
to make it too personal

perhaps even obsessive.

One must be obsessive
in this field of ours

but we have to be careful
of too much, um

faith... in our own ideas.

Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

Peter, this is Samuel Diaz,
my TA.

I'm advising him on his thesis.

So, are you still thinking
of leaving academia?

Formally, yes.
Mm-hm.

Uh, I need to get
my student loans paid off.

Mm-hm.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

<i>I thought your research
was really fascinating.</i>

Me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

Thank you.

They pick everything apart.

Anyone without a Ph.D.
gets run through the gauntlet.

I could, if you'd like

uh, refer you
to some standard guidelines

for formatting and publishing.

<i>Or perhaps Peter could be
a person to talk to</i>

about that lab position
that, uh, you're after.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

<i>"Welcome back
to "The New American Journal</i>

<i>I'm your host,
Dr. Elizabeth Brookings.</i>

<i>On today's show, we're
discussing the feature story</i>

<i>from our latest issue
about new findings concerning</i>

<i>the "Windsor Hum."</i>

<i>And how does this all relate</i>

<i>to the apartment tunings
you conduct?</i>

Are you familiar with
the concept of a macro-scope?

You mean a very big microscope?

Um, it's a way of seeing things
that are larger

so, in this case,
it's a way of seeing patterns.

Once the predominant harmonies
are determined..

They're translated here.

So, all of this, in a sense,
is a macro-scope.

Typically..

I know the solution
to a client's issues

before I even arrive.

And it always works?

D, F, A.

That's amazing.
You read music?

Peter.
Har... Harold Carlyle.

Uh, we're really glad you
finally accepted our invitation.

Your assistant mentioned
potential for financing

my research.

Of course, of course.

The... the recent
"New Yorker" article

really piqued my interest.

So, uh, my assistant pulled
materials

for our meeting.

And it turns out,
we've actually used

some of your designs.

How do you mean?

Well, the Echo Decay Timer.

I understand, at least I heard

it was born
in the basement of the Met.

Well, I had a position
in the Preservation Department.

Was maintaining period
instruments

for musical performances

to be historically accurate,
and..

<i>I mean, we've significantly
upgraded the device</i>

in the last decade,
but the EDT-1 was..

It was a cornerstone
for concert recording.

It was never intended
for that purpose, so..

Oh. Well, excuse me. I, um..

What was it for, then?

I was studying
harmonic resonance.

And the manufacturer
retained my patent

in exchange
for custom fabrication.

But I never wanted it
to be marketed for the public.

Well, it was
a revolutionary product.

Tool.

"Tool." Of course.

I no longer engage
with outside fabricators.

<i>Well, our clients</i>

are Fortune 500 creatures.

You're more of a provider
for houses, right?

Homes.

"Bespoke domesticity."

That's what friends
of mine call it.

<i>But really, that's what
we're interested in.</i>

<i>The market is changing,
and we want</i>

<i>to cater our products</i>

<i>to our customer's private lives.</i>

I... I'm offering you
an opportunity, Peter.

Uh... how is
Equilibrium delivered?

Well, it's wall colors,
fragrances, soundscapes.

And our technologies
allow our specialists

to survey
entire homes virtually.

Virtually?

<i>Well, I mean, it's, uh,
currently just</i>

a web chat,
but, honestly, you know..

The virtual component
isn't bulletproof

but the clients love it.

Our technologies, and our muscle

could give you a chance

to create an entire atmosphere.

<i>Yes, I... imagine the ability
to influence like that.</i>

I think that I've had
a very positive influence

on the lives of my clients.

(METAL CLANKING)

We bought the matching set
when we moved in.

I thought you lived alone.

I do. I... I do, yeah.

This is a very long time ago.

Mm-hm.

Didn't think it mattered.

It shouldn't.

So, you've been
using this every morning?

Every morning.


You've got a problem here.

What do you mean?

Mm, your feelings continue?

Yes, my, um,
my feelings continue.


Perhaps I should visit
your work.

Really?

To understand what you're doing
that might be

conflicting with the results.

Does anyone have to be there?

Well, ideally it would be
in the morning.

But I could visit
in the afternoon

then try to replicate
a morning scenario.

It's just,
it's a very unusual thing

to have to explain.

You know, I... I... I like
to keep things

at my job kind of...

Discreet. I understand.

Um, maybe I could come by
next week?

Okay.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)


What does red mean?

It's just an anomaly.

Does it affect the research?

Of course not.

Good.

Because I already notified
"The Journal"

to expect your submission.

Can I help you with that?

No.

You know, I was actually
thinking that I could process

the tapes a lot faster
with the university servers.

Uh, our computers there
are very efficient.

Well, everything here
works just fine.

Yes, but it would

help speed up the workflow

and save me a lot of time

because obviously,
I'm still looking

for a full-time position
elsewhere.

<i>Beyond publishing,
I... I think there'll be</i>

<i>a lot of other applications.</i>

You know, once people
understand the patterns

and, uh, the influences

you can do so much with this.

How do you mean?
I don't know.

Well, I... I..

Well, I guess, urban design,
architecture

home products.

This is about
universal constants

not commerce.

I... I'm sorry. I just..

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Stick out your tongue.
My tongue? Really?

I can see things on your tongue
that can help me.

Do you exercise regularly?

Sometimes.

Okay.

You can go to the Blue Room now.

Uh, yeah, where should... where
should I change?

(PIANO MUSIC)

More hot water, Peter?

Ah, yes. Certainly.

Thank you, Albert.

Yes, thank you.

You've really constructed
a unique little world

for yourself
in the city, haven't you?

I've lived here
for over a decade

and I don't know

I still feel
like there's so much

that's unfamiliar to me.

Like, someone else built it up.

He was very organized
about things.

The matching nightstands.

<i>He always had an idea
or an opinion</i>

about everything.

It was nice, you know?

To not have to make choices
for myself.

It sounds silly, but..

I remember after he was gone..

The remote felt so odd
in my hand, like..

I didn't know what
any of the buttons were for.

Sorry, that's probably
way too personal.

It's fine.

What about you?

I'm very consumed with my work.

Actually, I'm, I'm publishing
a piece on human behavior..

How sound influences

the way that people connect
with each other.

Well, I mean, you obviously
have a, a calling.

You know, just to see you study

and observe,
the way that you do.

I'm a little envious, honestly.

Did you study science?

No.

Music Theory.

So, I learned by dissection

how a piece of music works,
what are its parts.

You know Bach,
the composer Bach?

His ability to trick our ears

into believing
that we're hearing

multiple instruments
from a single violin.

Or Stravinsky... and his
dissonance

designed to alienate an audience

or, or Beethoven,
this use of suspense

and... delayed gratification.

But all of these composers were
using neurological techniques

that scientists
hadn't even defined yet.

And once I understood that
and, um..

How their music functioned

um, I guess I just went on
from there.

To tuning people's apartments?


Yes. Yes, but no.

I.. It's, um..

It's the influence of sound.

The power it has
over people's lives..

Hm... they may not even know it,
you know.

Yeah, it's, um, so complex.

I'm intrigued.
Hm.

I have a very, very close friend

who's a neuroscientist
at Columbia.

And his students are reviewing
my findings next week

in a group session.

It's very informal.

And if you're interested
in learning more, um..

I don't know.

We're working on it.

Well, Ellen's entire soundscape

in her apartment.

Um, but... there is,
there is distraction.

So, I've had trouble locating
the specific trigger.

Well, that's interesting.

You make it sound

It is complicated.
No, no.

I think what your friend
is saying, Peter

is that you make it sound
too complicated.

But, however, knowing Peter, I'm
sure he could show you a diagram

on the whole G major theory.

That's right.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Thank you so much.

<i>Your honors from Columbia
are very impressive.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

And your work with Peter Lucian

did you accompany him
on his house calls?

No.

But we've been working
especially hard

on consolidating his data
on the city as a whole.

Samuel Diaz.

It's a pleasure to meet you
in person.

I'm Harold.
Very nice to meet you, Harold.

Uh, you know, we're big admirers
of Peter here.

We were actually just discussing
the new work

he and Sam are doing.

Oh?
Uh..

Well, it's Peter's discovery.
Mm-hm.

Uh, I assume he discussed the
urban sound patterns with you?

Um, have there been any updates?

Well, uh, yes, actually.

It's... it's,
it's very, very exciting.

(SWITCH CLICKS)

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

My biggest client project
to date.

So, these beams... reach
true ground.

What's true ground?

Oh, it means they reach
all the way down to the earth.

It's a hard thing to come by
in New York City

but we designed these so they'd
make contact with bedrock.

And what's the point of that?

Well... grounding current
is really the only way

to achieve
true electrical silence.

That sounds like a total luxury
in this city.

Oh, well, the future tenant
is an electrophysiologist.

And he takes true ground
and silence very seriously.

Sounds nice, true silence.
Mm-hm.

And so expensive.

Well, I guess expense
is relative

to perceived value... right?

Please don't tell me
you're gonna make me

ground my apartment.

No.

Look at all that.

You see the order?

In the city?

Well, yeah.
I mean, the grid, right?

And it... it's flawed at points

but there are all these
connections.

Light going from red to green.
Walk, don't walk.

Instructions, right?

But what I've found..

Is that there's something
deeper at work.

Um... an invisible system,
but powerful, nonetheless

sounds, that, in a sense

guide people through the city.

Hm.
Yeah?

I mean, they're not conscious
of it, but it's there.

And it's different
in all parts of the city.

Hm.

In the Financial District,
it's the key of D minor.

And it's frenetic,
it's fast-paced..

Reckless.

And then, Lower East Side
is A flat

once you get,
um... below the dissonance.

(TUNING FORK CHIMING)

And Central Park
is predominantly G major.

<i>It's where I made
my first discovery.</i>

It's the sound of nostalgia.

It's calm..

Idyllic, lyrical.

Field test 14,
Central Park, G major.

(TUNING FORK CHIMING)

(CHIMING CONTINUES)

So, each part of the city
has a different chord?

Well, every part of the city

has its own instructive
atmosphere.

It's impossible
to disconnect the sound

from the collective state
of mind. It a..

It affects the people.
You understand?

Oh, but I, I don't see
the world that way.

I mean, it.. That's so rigid.

I mean, if I'm Downtown

I'm not destined
to feel frenetic.

I can choose to react to that
and feel peaceful.

I can choose to protect myself.

It's not about seeing anything.

It's... it's about acknowledging
what already exists.

Like gravity, or light.
These are just universal laws.

Right...
And listen.

These are, these are rules
that define our world.

Why does it have to be
this permanent thing

that controls us?

Why... do people act the way
they do?

Why do people feel the way
they do?

There's a reason.
Because they're people.

They can. They choose to feel.

But... but there are rules
guiding their behavior

that they can't see.

There is an order here.

Now, it's complex
because we live in an old city.

And the patterns
are so complicated

but it's, it's been written
and rewritten

but it's there.
It's been there for years.

I... I don't feel like my life
is written by anything.

I feel like I make choices
all the time.

Uh-huh. Well, okay.

Your apartment, C minor.
It's a mundane key.

It's... it's the sound
of resignation.

Okay, well,
I don't feel that way.

And that resignation
causes your restlessness.

And there are unseen forces
that are governing your choices.

What about you?

You're the only person
who's not affected by any of it?

I'm not immune. No one is.

Okay, so then,
how do you trust yourself?

Because I can hear it.

Because you can hear it?


I'm gonna go.
Just.. It's late, so..

(MELLOW MUSIC)

The program of the
Noise Abatement Commission

consists of a series
of noise measurements

to be made in different parts
of the city

at typical places..

And centers of popular interest.

Among these measurements

will be made tests of the
deafening effect of the noise.

I hold the receiver
against the microphone

instead of against my ear.

Now, I increase the intensity
of the test tone

until you can hear it.

(SIREN WAILING)



How much longer
is he gonna be here?

I have to get up early for work.

I think he's almost done.


Hey, are you almost done?

It's almost midnight.

So, um..

(DISTANT RINGING)

That ringing..

Baby, come on.
Get him out of here.

I'm sorry, I just need to take
a few more readings

and I can handle the rest
in my office.

I just need one more minute.

One more minute.

You know what?

Don't worry about it,
we can figure it out from here.

<i>If Sam showed Sensory my work</i>

He wouldn't do that, Peter.
Oh, fuck!

And you can't fault him
for taking a formal job.

It's a good opportunity.

They're my competition.
It's theft.

I wouldn't paint it so starkly.
I mean..

They're marketers.
You're a explorer.

Look, they can't take credit
for my discovery

if I publish it first.

<i>We put so much emphasis on sound</i>

<i>and thus, overlook the value
of those moments</i>

<i>in between the noise.</i>

And let this remind us
that silence is not empty

but immeasurably full.

Enjoy your evening.

Dr. Brookings.
Hello.

It's Peter Lucian.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Thank you so much for your talk.

It was fascinating. And for your
contributions to the field.

You know, I've been reading
"The New American"

for just about as long
as you've had the editorship.

That's very kind. Um, thank you
so much for coming tonight.

I'm sorry, but I really must go.
Uh, please enjoy your evening.

Well, actually, um

I recently submitted a piece
for "The Journal."

I know these things take time

but I just thought I would
inquire since I'm here.

What did you say your name was?

Peter Lucian.

Um... I made a discovery

identifying sound patterns
in the city.

And your work... was
just a huge inspiration for me.

I, uh..

I honestly didn't think
we'd have a chance to talk.

Oh. Thank you.

No, I didn't think
you were serious, Mr. Lucian.

I must say, your methods
are, um, most unusual.

H... have you seriously
been researching these...

Sound patterns. Yes.

They are principles
that steer our behavior.

I mean,
it's... it's... it's verified.

It's based off of
multiple field recordings.

Oh, I'm sure you believe
in this.

Listen..

Perhaps you could submit it
for peer review.

Yes, yes.
Uh, I'll tell you what.

Um, we will, uh, give it
a closer look

and we'll send you a proper,
uh, response letter.

Alright. Alright.
Okay? Alright? Alright.

Pleasure meeting you.

It's nice to meet you.
Take care.
