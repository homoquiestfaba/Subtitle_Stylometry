We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

This is suicide!

She is just one of many abductions.

Why is this abduction so special!

Is it because she's 
a witness againstTorrez?

He probably has her locked up,
drugged out of her mind.

We do not have to do this!

If not us...

...then Who?

I told you to stay still!

Do not try to capture Torrez!

Turn around now!

Machete, you son of a bitch!

Listen to orders!

You'll eventually kill us all!
Wait for reinforcements!

Whatever happens...

I'm with you...

... Boss.

This is the BOSS...

Sorry.

Get dressed.

It's too hot for clothes.

Careful!

You saving me from Torrez?

You've got balls!

That looks like me.

What's this long hard thing?

My Machete.

Is it sharp?

Very...

Good...

I got him

Stupid FUCK...

I told you to stay away asshole.

If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

How did I do?

Excellent my love.

Excellent...

This is what happens when they insist
on being heroes.

Why are you so insistent?

I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

I own the DEA... I own
the Marshals...

Why can't I own you?

Why don't you take the money
I offered you to look the other way?

What's your price?

Maybe I should ask your
wife.

Bring her in here.

No!

Sara!

Your daughter... she's in
school right now.

No?

I don't think so.

The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

But.

You don't deserve to die honorably.

Burn it!

Joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.

Deputy Director of our local Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) office.

Thank you and pleasure to be here.

What steps are you taking to
secure our borders?

ICE is working with local law enforcement
to improve patrols...

but there's over 2000 miles of border between
Mexico and the U.S.

And over half of that is here in Texas,

So we need to attack the problem at it's source.

There's a whole support network.

That not only helps illegal aliens get

across but is helping them get settled.
Once they are here.

We need to uncover and dismantle this
network.

It's our top priority and our most
talented ICE agents are investigating them now.

Agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for
Operation Network.

The Operation is suspected to be run by
a woman named Loose.

Codename: She.

Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

Loose operates out of a taco truck
at the labour site.

There's a interesting...

face.

No! That's ok.

Thank you.

He's new.

Run through database for
possible criminal background.

Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoos

Don't fuck with me, I won't
fuck with you attitude.

Hey!

You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

Hi, lady

You need a gardener?

Here.  Get out.

Hurry up!

We're not there yet.
You can't just leave us here!

Move!

She is sick.

Roundup time!

Look at them!

Speak english?

Well, I don't speak much Mexican neither.

You know...

You're trespassing...

on my daddy's land.

Jesus Von! Can't you see
she's with child?

If it's born here,
it gets to be a citizen.

No different than you and me.

I know most people don't like us.

Call us...Vigilantes.

But it's really about vigilance.

Somebody’s gotta keep watch
on this great nation of ours.

Otherwise...

Texas will become...

Mexico once again.

Who's gonna stop it senator?

I am.

Welcome to America.

You catch all that?

Burn me a DVD.
Behind, all our supporters
are going to like that...a lot!

<i>[ ANNOUNCER ON VIDEO ]:

Bet's! Place your bets!

Fight!

Thanks.

Can I get a couple of bean and cheese,
and a Café Olé.

We got no café Olé.

Regular coffee then

Oh! hold the spit please.

Why do you pretend to come here
just for coffee?

I'm not pretending.

I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

I can refuse service to anyone.

It's the American way.

Yeah, when they're citizens.

Got your papers?

Same as the last time you checked.

And the time before that.

And the time before that!

Got yours?

Same as the last time you checked.

You think what you do is right?

Taking your brothers and sisters in?

Deporting them back to their own
personal hell?

It's the law.

There are many laws.

There sure are...

immigration fraud...

aiding in illegal entry,

unsanitary food prep...

but you wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

Can I get my tacos?

Who's she?

I hear she runs an underground network.

How the hell would I know?

I just make tacos and I sell them.

to the workers of this world.

It fills their bellies with something
other than hate.

Funny.

Sounds like something SHE would say.

Catch you later.

In the race for State Senator...

Latest polls are showing...

a sharp decline in support for incumbent
John McLaughlin,

and his hard-line position on immigration.

Get in.

$70. a day for yard work,

$100. for roofing,

$125. for sceptic...

Sewage.

You ever killed anyone before?

You know this guy?

Senator John McLaughlin...

Independent from Cocksucker County.

Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

Gets worse.

Yes... If he has his 'druthers,
he'd send you back to 'Old Mehico'.

That's his platform.

Ship 'em all back, but first make 'em
build a wall along the border
for no pay.

'Thank you very much,
get the fuck out.'

But what the Senator fails to understand is...

this state runs on illegal labor.

Thrives on it,

keeps costs down,

keeps the wheels turning.

We bust that up
and we're fucked.

My words.

Now I'm guessing you don't
have papers.

As you well know...

illegal immigrants like yourself...

are being forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

So for the sake of both
our peoples...

the senator must die.

And for that. I will give you
150 thousand dollars cash.

Get someone else.

No time.

This job has to happen tomorrow.

I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

How long would it take you
to get this kind of money?

5... 10... 15 years?

You can do a lot of good things with this.

You deserve it.

Now I can't make you do this,

But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

Are you in?

Have a look at this...

Straight line design,

Laser designated scope.

You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

And keep the balls unruffled.

Machete?

That's only good if you wanna make a
brutal point.

But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

Backup...

Here's your backup.

Me.

You call or text
if you have any problems or delays.

You need to be on that
roof by 1 pm sharp.

And put a bullet in the senator
by 1:04.

Get up!

God damn it April.

My business partner has
very little tolerance
for bullshit.

That's the second operation
in the last six months

I've had to close down
because of your mentally...

I told you a thousand times.

You need something
you come to me directly.

You do not go to these labs.

You got something to say to me?

Sorry daddy.

What's this?

$150 thousand

Cash.

Are you out of your mind?

The Network got me across once.

Use this.

For the people you help.

I don't know how you know what you know.

But I'm glad I know you.

What'd you want?

Here.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Senator John McLaughlin.

I want to thank you all for coming
out today!

And I want to thank my supporters
from the bottom of my heart.

Because we have been tested.

Tested by fire!

Our borders have been
put to the test, and let me tell you
we have failed that test.

The aliens,  the infiltrators, the outsiders...

they come right across
by light of day and dark of night.

They'll bleed us, they're parasites.

They'll bleed us until we as city,

a county, a state,

a nation, are all bled out.

Now make no mistake,
we are at war.

Every time an illegal dances across
our border,

it is an act of aggression against
this sovereign state.

an overt act of terrorism.

Everywhere I go in this glorious state,

people are talking about change.

I say why change?
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

I don't want to change that.

Our rightful citizens are
hardworking Americans,

who have earned their paychecks
by the grit of their guts and
the sweat of their brow!

I don't want to change that!
-Yeah!

Change! That's what they want,
change!

Change the laws,
open the doors!

Red rover! Red rover!

Let the terrorists come over!

Let me tell you what change
that'll bring!

68 cents!

The jingle-jangle
of pennies in your pocket;

because the scavengers, the leeches,
the parasites,

are walking away with your money,

while you're left
with the change!

So, I wanna say one more thing:

Who you gonna vote for?

There!

Up there! I saw someone shot from up there!

Get him to Fort Briggs!

Roger! I'm on my way.

Go ahead.

Shoot him Nacho.

'Cus right after that.

The three of us

Are gonna shoot one of you.

Ah,  Shit!

Try it.

Go ahead,  Pancho...

I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

This is fucking big.

This guy took a shot at a representative.

No! A Senator.

This is fucking high.

The guy can die and we caught him.

Hell yeah, we did!

And they'll gonna hang your ass
like Saddam!

Look I'm gonna call the boss
unless you wanna do it.

Yeah, you go ahead.

We got the Mexican black bird
that fell off the rooftop!

Bring him to the basement.

He stills thinks we're cops.

Well of course he will think that.

We frisked him, we cuffed him, we
throw him in the car.

Apprehended him just like the
real cops do.

Um, I didn't frisk him.

Yes, you did.
Man, I'm telling you I didn’t...

Oh! Sweet Jesus.

Oh! DAMN!

Shocking news this hour.

Senator John McLaughlin
was shot in the leg this afternoon
by an unknown gunman.

The Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital,

where he was reportedly in good and
stable condition.

Video taken at the rally
indicate the gunman may have been
of Mexican descent.

Senator McLaughlin has been very vocal
against immigration.

And campaigned for
stricter border patrols.

Boss.

Video.

You see what I am sending you Mr. Torrez.

It's coming on my screen now.

That's campaign gold.

I thought my contributions
were for the Senator's re-election,

not his retirement.

McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

And in the new session,
as promised,

he'll ramrod through
everything we asked for.

Pause!

Go back.

Who's this?

Nobody.

A day labourer from the streets.
He won't be missed.

Is he dead?

Dead or dying on a rooftop,
if that's what you mean.

What the fuck is it! Asshole...

Dead or dying?

He'll be dead within minutes.
I guarantee.

For your sake.

What?

It's me. It's done.
I think he's toast.

Don't think! Verify!
Check the morgue,

check the hospitals,
check everywhere.

Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

But you're with us.

Nobody knows you're here.

You were brought here under the name John Doe,

as a mere spectator.

Is that him?

Yes.   Dr. Felix
wants to see him.

Quietly...

Amazing, you can see
where the bullet rebounded.

It was stopped by another bullet that
was previously lodged there.

If he hadn't been shot before,
he'd be dead now.

There's actually a lesson
in there somewhere .

I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

Woah, woah, woah,
at least it's not on your colon.

Well, actually did you know that the...

ah, human intestines is ten times longer
than the length of the body?

Wait!  So the human intestines is
60 feet long?

It's true.

Ah!  The hero has awoken!

My friend! You are safe, they are
from The Network.

They will take good care of you.

Leave him alone.

Hi, what can I do for you?

What can you do for me?

I'm looking for a gentleman
that was just brought in.

Probably into ICU.

Where might I find him?

You wanna go straight down
the hall, to your right...

Make a left, two rights and another left.

And you'll be right there.

You sure about that?

Hm Huh!

I'm going this way.

Someone's coming.

We got trouble.

Is there another way outta here?

No other exits.

Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.

That's a skull scraper.  We use that
to scrape the bones clean.

And those can cut through flesh
just like butter.

Pass that tank.

Hold it!

Boss ain't gonna like this.

What are we gonna tell him?

Ooops.

[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

Speak to me.
What's your 20, agent?

I'm on my lunch break sir.
Lunch is over. All hell is breaking loose,

someone took a shot
at Senator McLaughlin.

It was an illegal.

I'm watching it right now.

<i>[ WOMAN ON TELEVISION ]:
This amateur video was taken outside
county hospital,</i>

<i>just after the failed attempt to
assassinate Senator McLaughlin.</i>

<i>Authorities believe that this suspect
is extremely dangerous...</i>

Son of a bitch...

No! not you sir.

I've seen him before.
Bring him in, Rivera.

Yes sir. I'm on my way.

<i>[ WOMAN ON TELEVISION]:
He may be in this country illegally.</i>

<i>And that he is, of course, to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

You're all over the TV! Cabron!
Come on get inside!

Hurry!

<i>[ WOMAN ON TV ]:
The shot fired on Senator
McLaughlin today, may be,</i>

<i>just the shot in the arm
his campaign needed.</i>

<i>New numbers indicate that he has
now taken a commanding,</i>

<i>lead from the wake of today's incident.</i>

Since the shooting, others agree that
border security should be heavily enforced.

Yes, hold the illegals responsible!
Close the border!

Eh... yeah!

Didn't you cross the border to
get here Jack?

Well,I'm already here.
Fine with me if they close it.

Panocha!

"Pussy," pronouce it the right way.

Waay!

You didn't have a choice,
of course I believe you.

why else would you give me the money?

They'll be looking  for your ass.

You'll be safe here.

Try not to bleed on the bed.

Are you "She"?

If I were "She," do you think
I'd be operating a taco truck?

"She" brings hope.

"She" rights the wrongs.

Unfortunately, "She's" a myth.

Just someone I made up to
lead The Network.

At first, I just wanted to help
people get settled,

give them food, find them work.

Now there's a war
against us.

Von and his border vigilantes.

Hunting us down like dogs.

And there's no one there to stop 'em.

You can...

You're a fighter!

Only when there is something
worth fighting for.

Is there?

Always.

When the sun rises, you should be good.

Careful!

Don't start what you can't finish.

Machete.

You know me?

I know the legend.

Maybe the legend's better.

I'll be the judge of that.

Where are you? Mr. Mysterious?

Oh my God!

Gunning the Senator down in the street!
What on earth were they thinking?

Sometimes I worry about April and
what kinda world we're leaving her.

A fucked up world.

I'd ought to wash your mouth out with soap.

Give me another taco.

Someone took a shot at a senator.
What kind of world would you call it?

A fucked up world.

You're like two peas in a pod.

So, Um,

I think David is going to ask me
to marry him.

But I have priorities.

School and a career.

Salsa!

Actually I was thinking more
about my modeling.

You are a very pretty girl April,

but that's a tough enough to crack.

I know all about cracking nuts.

Do you even know how many hits I
get on my website?

You have a website?  She has a
website? Did you know about this?

I know all about what the online public wants.

And they want ME!

All of ME!

[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

That does it. I'm sending
you to a convent.

What?

He's loose.  He got away.

God damn it!  How hard is it to kill a
God damn day laborer?

You go down to that corner where I
picked him up,

you find him!

Do it!

Seen the bean wagon?

No... I don't speak English.

Speak .45?

Where's the taco truck lady at?

Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen
her this morning. She's late.

She...

You know where she lives!

Alright...go get him.

You're all over the god damn TV.

Get in!

Agent

You're the second beautiful
girl that's picked me up today.

Exploding houses!

Bodies falling from the sky!

Jesus Christ, Machete...

You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!

Yeah, I know who you are...

I'm Sartana Rivera.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ICE.
Fucking A!    La Migra (Immigration).

Don't worry, I won't ship you back,
if you tell me what I need to know.

Working my way up.

I can't be busting people at taco
stands anymore.

Hell, I'm probably related to half of them.

You need me more than I need you.

Come on.

You know all the cops in this
state are hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.

I wasn't gonna kill him.

Just gonna shoot him in the neck,

Stop him from saying all those
stupid things.

It was a set up.

There was another shooter there.

There was another shooter?

Who?

Drive!

Drive.

I know what they did to your family,

and if I were you, I wouldn't trust
anyone either, but it's different here.

Laws are enforced.

And people control them.
Not drug lords.

The system works here.

Says you.

I started working on the night shift
taking out the trash.

But I worked my way up.

As translator, assistant...

now I'm special agent in
charge of investigations.

Sounds like they still got you
taking out the trash.

Let me take you in,

put you into witness protection.

All you got to do is tell me who
hired you to take out the senator.

Fine.

Holy Shit.

You mean to tell me that
a Mexican day-laborer is a
God damn Federale?

That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all
rolled in one mean fucking burrito.

Is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?

Yes.

And so far, you've failed.

So far.

I'm sorry to see you have a high tolerance
for failure, Vonieta.

I don't...

How's that?

Not bad!

The last time we spoke you could have mentioned
that he was a Federale...God damn it!

Notoriously hard to kill,
trust me.  I've tried.

Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.

The very best the Great State of Texas has to offer.

Osiris Amanpour.

If Machete is captured alive,

he'll expose my entire operation.

You have 24 hours take him down,

or I'm coming there myself...

and I'll kill him myself.

Little Cunt!

Sorry, my friend.

My grandmother always said, you
can solve any problem with food.

And you my friend,

have plenty of problems.

So, who are you working for?

Who wants the senator dead?

Is it The Network?

Luz?

She doesn't know anything about it.

Network either.

The man who hired me, wasn't Mexican.

Really?

So he was just some random guy who...

said:  'Hey, wanna kill the senator today'?

And you are like cool?

I was afraid he wanted sceptic work.

Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.

That's a lot of money.

So that's why you did it?

For the money.

Look, Machete.

You're not legal in this country.

And after what happened to you in Mexico,
there is no way you're going home.

So basically, you're a man with no country.

And lucky for you. I can help you out.

Look at me.

I can get you papers.

But you've got to let me bring you in.

I'm gonna find the guy that did this.

And bring him to you.

Why should I trust you?

Because we are both cops.

I'd tell you to stop, but
I know you took the bullets.

Luz!

Luz!

You didn't think they'd take me down
that easily did ya?

You're alive.
But your house man!

It's beginning, my little big-shots.

I've got something to show you guys,
come on.

I told you they were gunning for us.

Who knows what
they're gonna do next?

Holy shit, Luz!

I didn't now that
you were this loaded.

You got more heat
than the Popos (police).

It's a good start,
but we'll need a lot more.

Need it for what?

La Revolución. (The Revolution).

Von and his men are coming for us.

We need to be ready.

I'm not gonna be around forever.

If anything happens, you need to tell Machete
the people need him.

Who exactly is this Machete?

That's him...

he's the one!

Hands up!

Against the wall.

All of you, move it!

Where's Machete?

Shit. She knows. Man!

Amiga's gonna deport our ass back.

Nobody's deporting anybody.

Machete already told me you guys weren't
involved in the shooting.

Although... I should probably
check the "carnitas".

For lead!

What is this place anyway?

Welcome to The Network.

These are some
of the people I've helped.

Helped them cross,

Got them jobs,

then make sure that they do their part.

And these?

These are the guys trying to stop us.

Von Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

They started off with a couple of deer rifles
and a warped sense of justice.

In the past year,
they've grown.

More guns, more men.

Who's funding them?

Whoever it is, is making a mess
of our operation.

And these?

Missing.

I have leads on a few of them.
They were supposed to have crossed,
but I have no way to track 'em.

How deep does your operation go?

Deep.

All types, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys...

that's why they call it "The Network".

The way we see it,
people risked everything to get here.

The system doesn't work.

It's broken.

So we created our own.

So, look, you gonna burn us, Huh?

Turn us all in?

No.

I'm gonna walk away and pretend
I didn't see any of this.

Tell Machete I'm looking for him!

I am a man of faith,

I took a vow of peace.

And I don't shoot anymore.

And you don't shoot any less either.

I don't see you or hear
from you in three years,

and now you want me to
help you kill all these men?

Yes, bro...

I mean, Padre (Father).

[ SIGHS ]
I'll see what I can do.

I want you to say 10 'Our Fathers'
and 10 'Hail Marys.'

Light a candle for mom...

For funerals.
A little side business.

I had these installed
when too many things started walking away
from the altar and collection plates.

Imagine if we had this kind of setup
when we were Federales.

This is how you get the bad guys now.

You catch them on video.

Cuban?

Mexican.

Yeah, I got some of that.

I've got something
I want you to see

<i>[ MAN ON TELEVISION ]:
Rest assured he will be caught.</i>

<i>This is the first shot
of a war that...</i>

<i>we didn't ask for.</i>

Nice way to find out
your brother's in town.

<i>[ MAN ON TELEVISION ] :
These intruders, they mean to have--</i>

Right there.

<i>[ BOOTH ON TELEVISION ]:
We can only hope that--</i>

That's the guy that hired me.

Michael Booth?

He's McLaughlin's
aid or some shit.  Ha!

<i>[ BOOTH ON TELEVISION ]:
It should be understood that the Senator
advocates no form of violence--</i>

You know him?

Yeah... he comes in for confession
all the time,

lot of 'impure thoughts:'

mostly about his daughter.

I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink.

Here's his file.

Once he started talking about
his connections to the cartels,

I figured it'd come in handy.

I bet McLaughlin doesn't even know
that most of Booth's business are just a
front for his drug trade.

What I don't understand is: why would
he hire you to kill his own boss?

Don't know.

Gonna find out.

It's not safe for you to be here.

Not looking for safe.

No, I mean it's not safe
for ME for you to be here.

I absolve you of all your sins,

Now get the fuck out!

Okay, bro...

but I'm borrowing your car.

Why are you complaining about a weak neck,

I'd said you should fucking do some sit-ups.

Hey... hey, hey boss?

Who're you?

The new gardener

Gardener?

[ HUNGARIAN ]

I'm just fucking with you, chief.

It's Hungarian for
'I'm gonna kill you, you little monkey.'

You know what?
There's a big pile of shit in the back,

You can go clean that up. Alright!

Make sure you do a good job.

Make sure you wipe those boots off!

He's carrying shit in the house.

You ever notice how you let a
Mexican into your home...

just because he's got
gardening tools?

I mean, no questions asked,

you just let him right in.

He could have a chainsaw
or a machete...

God! Jesus!

Stop it!

Damn it, that hurts!

[ FEMALE LAUGHTER ]

If your father
ever saw me doin' this--

Mom, everyone is
gonna see you do this.

it's the internet.

This is what my viewers
wanna see online.

Hey! You're not the usual guy!

He looks good to me.

Oh don't be shy, come on in!

Holy Sh--
What the fuck did you
bring them here for?

Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?

Want me to dump 'em?

What? No.

No, I will make good use of them.

The Church can always use good people.

June?

April?

[ MACHINE BEEPING
WHILE BEING PROGRAMMED ]

[ CELL PHONE RINGING ]

Sorry ma'am.

This damn new phone,

Should put it on vibrate.

Can you help me do that?

Pervert.

Yeah?

Senator?

This is Von.

I hear you got a problem
that maybe we can fix.

Don't call me on this line again;
I'll call you.

Now you said it yourself Senator
war has begun.

Helter Skelter is here.

Your army awaits further orders.

Got to be respectful now,

no shit slaves.

What about the shooter?

He's still out there?

There's nothing I'd like more,
than to see that Mexican dance the bolero
with the end of a rope.

He's gone underground for sure.

Let's say we go underground,

and get him.

Find the Network and you
find the shooter.

Call our special friend,
and tell him we're gonna need
a helluva lot more firepower,

if he's serious about wanting
that border shut down.

Fix your damn gun.

Oh, Thanks.

Our friend is up.

Where the fuck have you been?

You could at least texted me.

Machete don't text.

But Machete gets evidence.

Thanks for coming back.

There is no way
that McLaughlin is getting elected,
unless something big happens.

Can you imagine
if someone shot the senator,
and that someone was a Mexican.

The public would elect him
to be president.

It's not a sin if someone clinch
the senator in the leg is it?

So, this is footage
from your brother's confessional?

There's no commandment
against thou shall
not wing a man,

Is there Padre?

But these files over here.

You got from Booth's office.

They're encrypted.

It's my little girl April...
I spent nights...

Now, you don't think
it's gonna be that easy,
Do you?

I just wish that April
saw me as more of a real man.

Holy shit...

You were right,
the Network isn't behind it.

This is something
a helluva lot bigger.

You've got enough here
to bring down everyone.

The Senator, Booth...

Von...

Look here.

There's Mexican drug money
financing the Senator's campaign.

Rogelio Torrez.

Torrez...

He's the drug kingpin
who's been trying to gain control
of the drug trade.

This must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

See this?

These markings show the weakest spots.

It all makes sense now.

Torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin re-elected,

so that he can build
a border fence  that he
can control.

You did good work, Machete.

I bet you were a great cop.

The best.

And modest too.

I'm dry.

Get up.

Why?

Because you're drunk.

Come lay with me.

Speak English?

Depends on the question.

We know you hired
that Mexican to
kill our senator.

You the Network?
Ain't 'cha?

Hell! You're behind everything.

That's not how we work.

But if you want war...

I'll give it to you.

How about an eye for an eye?

You burned your last burrito.

You got to get better at this, Billy.

Please, Father, have mercy.

God has mercy, I don't

Hello Padre.

Blood of Christ?
Tastes like Merlot to me.

Where is he?

He's everywhere.

Talk Padre.

Sing me one of those Mexican hymns
like you crooned as an altar boy.

Go to hell.

You want to be a martyr?
I'm good at making martyrs.

Like Senator McLaughlin?

That's right.

We have to get that Senator re-elected,
get that fence built along the border,

before it is too late.

You really hate our kind that much?

No padre, I hate declining profits that much.

An open border allows supply of flowing too easily.

Drives our prices down.

Restricted border limits supply.
Drives the prices up.

Higher price, higher profits.

You are drunk with power,
even putting the hit on your own boss.

Just to boost his election numbers.

Last chance, amigo.

Where's Machete and
where are my wife and daughter?

In hell.

Then give them my best.

A real gentleman.

Comfortable...

Are they the same?

They want you dead too.

My brother.

Wait!

How do you text with this thing?

I thought Machete don't text.

Machete improvises.

Where're you going?

Take out the trash.

Machete, sent me a text.

What's it say?

You just fucked
with the wrong Mexican.

He's coming after us.

No, he's coming after you.

Vonieta, you have some news?

Yes.

His brother's dead.

You killed a priest.

Congratulations.

That's right Booth, I'm in your town.

And I'm gonna kill Machete.

And you're gonna watch it happen.

And it will be
the last thing you see.

Wait a second.

There's a girl from ICE.

She's with Machete and they have a file on me,

on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.

She can make things
very difficult for us.

Where is she?

You know, I've been thinking.

We let these people
into our homes,

watch our kids,

park our cars,

but we won't let them
into our country.

Does that make any sense to you?

Hey! That wetback
clubbed us both over the head.

In case you forgot,
he shot me in the leg.

I thought Jango shot you?

I don't want to hear
that story ever again.

Think about it.
He wasn't here for us.

He's here for the boss.

I've been watching the boss.
This guy's a real scumbag.

Hey, hey, hey.

Where's your loyalty at?

Did you hear that?

It's the weed whacker.

He's back!
Spread out.

Spread out NOW!

Alpha unit, you copy?

Quit!

Anybody report.
You hear me?

Anybody?

Where's Booth?

The Senator, he's with the Senator.

I have a GPS.

Tracks his limo.

Hey! Don't kill me,
please, take it.

That's Spanish for  "I let you live. "

Thanks Chief.

<i>A Texas vigilante,</i>

I know how it sounds, but I have Booth
on video committing a murder.

I have tons of confessions.

I mean it's...

Listen to yourself,
this man is an illegal alien,
ILLEGAL, as in against the law.

Well, there's the law and there's what's right.

I'm gonna do what's right.

We're ready for you Senator.

It's show time...

Oh yeah!
-You forgot your cane, sir.

Slow gait!

Ladies and gentlemen,

Senator John McLaughlin.

Thank you, thank you.

This Frito Bandito is not any closer to justice.

I urge this criminal and
those that are hiding him
to turn him in.

He is destroying us from the inside,

like the plague that he is...

We must not let
the terrorist win.

Senator?

There are reports implicating,

Would you care to comment?

What now?

No further comment.

I'm sorry, I just...

Are the border vigilantes involved
in running drugs?

I think I'm having a heart attack.

God dammit if you don't relax
you will have one.

You've jeopardized
more than my career.

We got cut back.

He could have killed me.

Not with that scope.

You stupid son of a bitch....

You pulled something like that
without consulting me?

Who the fuck
do you think you are? !

I'm the one who
got your campaign financed,

made you a political powerhouse;

So, you better get down on your knees,

to save your soul,

because I'm the only one
who can at this point!

Get the fuck out.

God dammit man,
why don't you just die?

It was gonna work.
We could have been rich.

Torrez.

He wanted to stop all that cheap shit
from moving across the border...

Did I tell you that?..

...competing with whatever
tired pendejo (fool) with a dime bag
and a dream.

So we financed Von.

Gave him and his men guns.

The Vigilantes.

Our own little private border patrol.

But Torrez wanted the whole enchilada.

So I thought, 'why not let politics
do what guns couldn't?'

Funny things is...I thought
it would be a more peaceful resolution.

None of that tortured taco.

Wait, wait...

Torrez is looking for you.

You find Von,
you'll find Torrez.

Please...
...Tell me...

Where are my wife and daughter?

With God.

I won't be seeing them.

It's not your war.

I maybe adopted, man,

No shit.

We just wanna help, bro.

I don't need your help.

Not us?

Then who?

Whatever you need,

they'll build it,

just like Padre (Father).

Then they aren't law!

Machete!

Networks said the senator calling
in the vigilantes to kill you.

And Agent Sartana,

she's been captured by Torrez!

We're all hands and
the bro's armory to load up!

Time to roll out!

Give me a vest and a rifle.

My great grand daddy...

did not give his life at the Alamo

so that we could
sell-out our nation

to a bunch of
backstabbing politicians.

What are you talking about?

You lied to us.

And you paid that Mexican
to put on an act:

to fool the people,

and to make fools of us.

Now he's on his way...

and no doubt bringing a whole
mess of bean-eaters.

You seem to be quite fond of the

too long, amigo...
